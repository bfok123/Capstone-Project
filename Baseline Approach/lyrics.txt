b"Oh baby, how you doing?
You know I'm gonna cut right to the chase
Some women were made but me, myself
I like to think that I was created for a special purpose
You know, what's more special than you? You feel me
It's on baby, let's get lost
You don't need to call into work 'cause you're the boss
For real, want you to show me how you feel
I consider myself lucky, that's a big deal
Why? Well, you got the key to my heart
But you ain't gonna need it, I'd rather you open up my body
And show me secrets, you didn't know was inside
No need for me to lie
It's too big, it's too wide
It's too strong, it won't fit
It's too much, it's too tough
He talk like this 'cause he can back it up
He got a big ego, such a huge ego
I love his big ego, it's too much
He walk like this 'cause he can back it up
Usually I'm humble, right now I don't choose
You can leave with me or you could have the blues
Some call it arrogant, I call it confident
You decide when you find on what I'm working with
Damn I know I'm killing you with them legs
Better yet them thighs
Matter a fact it's my smile or maybe my eyes
Boy you a site to see, kind of something like me
It's too big, it's too wide
It's too strong, it won't fit
It's too much, it's too tough
I talk like this 'cause I can back it up
I got a big ego, such a huge ego
But he love my big ego, it's too much
I walk like this 'cause I can back it up
I, I walk like this 'cause I can back it up
I, I talk like this 'cause I can back it up
I, I can back it up, I can back it up
I walk like this 'cause I can back it up
It's too big, it's too wide
It's too strong, it won't fit
It's too much, it's too tough
He talk like this 'cause he can back it up
He got a big ego, such a huge ego, such a huge ego
I love his big ego, it's too much
He walk like this 'cause he can back it up
Ego so big, you must admit
I got every reason to feel like I'm that bitch
Ego so strong, if you ain't know
I don't need no beat, I can sing it with piano"b"playin' everything so easy,
it's like you seem so sure.
still your ways, you dont see
i'm not sure if they're for me.
then things come right along our way, though we didn't truly ask.
it seems as if they're gonna linger
with every delight they bring,
just like what you have truly seemed.
i'm trying to think of what you really want to say,
even through my darkest day.
you might want to leave me,
feeling strange about you
like you're gonna let me know,
when words then slipped out of you.
when words dont come so easy to say
you just leave me feeling, come what may
though i want things coming from your way.
i say to you, you bore me all the time
when you seem to hold back all in you,
all that you want to let me know.
why dont you have the courage?
speak up and i'll listen,
if you truly want me to know, then tell me.
is there something wrong with you
and you seem fastened there.
it sounds as if there'll be a melody
if things in you are let out
and then i will feel alright.
when you sleep, do you feel the same,
exactly as i do?
i really want to hear things from you,
though i've felt something new
eversince you acted that way.
if i go,
would you still mind telling me?
if i stay,
you seem to let the days go by.
if you truly want to let me know,
then tell me."b"If you search
For tenderness
It isn't hard to find
You can have the love
You need to live
But if you look
For truthfulness
You might just
As well be blind
It always seems to be
So hard to give
Chorus:
Honesty
Is such a lonely word
Everyone is so untrue
Honesty
Is hardly ever heard
And mostly
What I need from you
I can always
Find someone
To say
They sympathize
If I wear my heart
Out on my sleeve
But I don't want
Some pretty face
To tell me
Pretty lies
All I want
Is someone
To believe
(Chorus)
I can find a lover
I can find a friend
I can have security
Until the bitter end
Anyone can comfort me
With promises again
I know, I know
When I'm deep
Inside of me
Don't be
Too concerned
I won't ask
For nothin'
While I'm gone
But when I want
Sincerity
Tell me where else
Can I turn
When
You're the one
That I depend upon
(Chorus)"b'Oh oh oh I, oh oh oh I
[Verse 1:]
If I wrote a book about where we stand
Then the title of my book would be "Life with Superman"
That\'s how you make me feel I count you as a privilege
This love is so ideal
I\'m honored to be in it
I know you feel the same I see it everyday
In all the things you do
In all the things you say
[Chorus:]
You are my rock
Baby you\'re the truth
You are my rock
I love to rock with you
You are my rock
You\'re everything I need
You are my rock
So baby rock with me
I wanna kiss ya, feel ya, please ya just right
I wanna touch ya, love ya, baby all night
Reward ya, for all the things you do
You are my rock
I love to rock with you
I love to rock with you
Oh oh oh I
[Verse 2:]
If I were to try to count the ways
You make me smile
I\'d run out of fingers
Before I run out of timeless things to talk about
Sugar you keeps it going on
Make me wanna keep my lovin strong
Make me wanna try my best
To give you what you want and what you need
Give you my whole heart, not just a little piece
More than a minimum,
I\'m talking everything
More than a single wish,
I\'m talking every dream
[Chorus:]
You are my rock
Baby you\'re the truth
You are my rock
I love to rock with you
You are my rock
You\'re everything I need
You are my rock
So baby rock with me
I wanna kiss ya, feel ya, please ya just right
I wanna touch ya, love ya, baby all night
Reward ya, for all the things you do
You are my rock
I love to rock with you
I wanna rock with you
[Bridge:]
If there\'s options I don\'t want them
They\'re not worth my time
Cause if it\'s not you, oh no thank you I like us just fine
You\'re a rock in the sand
You\'re a smile in a cry
You\'re my joy through the pain
You\'re the truth through the lies
No matter what I do I know that I can count on you
Oh oh oh I, oh oh oh I
[Chorus:]
You are my rock
Baby you\'re the truth
You are my rock
I love to rock with you
You are my rock
You\'re everything I need
You are my rock
So baby rock with me
I wanna kiss ya, feel ya, please ya just right
I wanna touch ya, love ya, baby all night
Reward ya, for all the things you do
You are my rock
I love to rock with you
I love to rock with you
Oh oh oh I, oh oh oh I
I wanna kiss ya, feel ya, please ya just right
I wanna touch ya, love ya, baby all night
Reward ya, for all the things you do
You are my rock
I love to rock with you
I wanna rock with you'b"Party the people, the people the party it's popping no sitting around,

Church bells ringing
I heard
A choir singing
I saw my love
Walk down
The aisle
On her finger
He placed a ring
Oooh, oh
I saw them
Holding hands
She was
Standing there
Wwith my man
I heard
Them promise
Til death do
Us part
Each word
Was a pain
In my heart
All I could do
All I could do
Was cry
All I could do
Was cry
I was
Losing the man
That I love
And all
I could do
Was cry
And now
The wedding
Is over
The rice, rice
Has been
Thrown over
Their heads
For them life
Has just begun
But mine
Is ending
Ooh
All I could do
All I could do
Was cry
All I could do
Was cry
I was losing
The man
That I love
And all
I could do
Was cry'b'This is just another day that I would spend
Waitin\' for the right one.
Staring at the night and wishin\' I could be the one
To feel the warm sun.
You\'re a dream, but I\'m wide awake
I\'m in Heaven, for heaven sakes
So get ready, (get ready) I\'m ready now (get ready)
I could never need you more than now
You were worth waiting for
You the one that I adore
Hold on to me tight
For once in my life
You were worth waiting for
You the one that I adore
This kind of love you\'ll only find
Once in a lifetime, once in a lifetime
Tell me that your living in a place
Where no one else can find you.
Tell me that your sanging out my name,
Hoping that I\'ll hear you.
Tell me "No" and I\'ll fade away,
But this is lovin that I won\'t waste
So get ready, (get ready) I\'m ready now (get ready)
I could never need you more than now
You were worth waiting for
You the one that I adore
hold on to me tight
For once in my life
You were worth waiting for
You the one that I adore
This kind of love you\'ll only find
Once in a lifetime, once in a lifetime
What are the words, I\'m needin\' to hear
How do I know if I\'ll ever love again
Seeing your face makes everything clear (clear) clear
And I will never be the same
You were worth waiting for
You the one that I adore
hold on to me tight
For once in my life
You were worth waiting for
You the one that I adore
This kind of love you\'ll only find
Once in a lifetime, once in a lifetime'b"Waiting, waiting, waiting, waiting

I read all of the magazines
while waiting around
you said you couldn't wait to see me
but you got stuck in town
so turn off the phone
now we're finally alone
and some moments at the end of the day
feel your touch and it's the sweetest
your kisses are my weakness
i never want them to go away
Chorus:
i wanna feel you in my heart (heart)
as i look into your eyes (eyes)
no need to get busy so lets take our time
and make slow love slow love
and every minute that we have (have)
it goes too fast
wanna show you how to rock it
so this feelin last and
make slow love slow love
slow love slow love slow love all night
Verse 2:
it is just a few little things
that you gotta know
a girl will give you all of her heart
when it's happening slow
i need a little laughter
and love will follow after
lets take this chance to steal away
your kisses are delicious
and no one is gonna miss us
tonight i really want you to stay
Chorus:
i wanna feel you in my heart (heart)
as i look into your eyes (eyes)
no need to get busy so lets take our time
and make slow love slow love

Bridge:
so I'm callin out do you hear my cries?
don't have to say goodbye
your the breath on my skin cherish the taste
it's far too good to go to waste

all through the night
make love through the night

You better sit down and look around
'Cause you must've bumped yo' head
And I love you enough to talk some sense back into you, baby
I'd hate to see you come home
Me, the kids, and the dog is gone
Check my credentials
I give you everything you want, everything you need
Even your friends say I'm a good woman
All I need to know is why?
Why don't you love me?
Tell me, baby, why don't you love me
When I make me so damn easy to love?
And why don't you need me?
Tell me, baby, why don't you need me
When I make me so damn easy to need?
I got beauty, I got class
I got style and I got ass
And you don't even care to care, looka here
I even put money in the bank account
Don't have to ask no one to help me out
You don't even notice that
Why don't you love me?
Tell me, baby, why don't you love me
When I make me so damn easy to love?
Why don't you need me?
Tell me, baby, why don't you need me
When I make me so damn easy to need?
I got beauty, I got heart
Keep my head in them books, I'm sharp
But you don't care to know I'm smart
N-n-n-n-n-no
I got moves in your bedroom
Keep you happy with the nasty things I do
But you don't seem to be in tune, ooh
Why don't you love me?
Tell me, baby, why don't you love me
When I make me so damn easy to love?
Why don't you need me?
Tell me, baby, why don't you need me
When I make me so damn easy to need?
There's nothing not to love about me
No, no, there's nothing not to love about me
I'm lovely, there's nothing not to need about me
No, no, there's nothing not to need about me
Maybe you're just not the one
Or maybe you're just plain dumb"b"I lay alone awake at night
Sorrow fills my eyes
But I'm not strong enough to cry
Despite of my disguise
I'm left with no shoulder
But everybody wants to lean on me
I guess I'm their soldier
Well, who's gonna be mine?
Who's there to save the hero
When she's left all alone?
And she's crying out for help
Who's there to save the hero?
Who's there to save the girl
After she saves the world?
After she saves the world
I bottle all my hurt inside
I guess I'm living a lie
Inside my mind each day I die
What can bring me back to life?
A simple word, a gesture
Someone to say you're beautiful
Come find this buried treasure
With eyes lead to a pot of gold
Who's there to save the hero
When she's left all alone?
And she's crying out for help
Who's there to save the hero?
Who's there to save the girl
After she saves the world?
After she saves the world
I've given too much of myself
And now it's driving me crazy
(I'm crying out for help)
Sometimes I wish someone would just come here
And save me, save me from myself
Who's there to save the hero
When she's left all alone?
And she's crying out for help
Who's there to save the hero?
Who's there to save the girl
After she saves the world?
After she saves the world"b"Hello hello baby you called

Love is so hard to find
You led me on to believe, you belong to me
oohh ooohh
I'm going trough difficult times
I always thought you were mine
Love doesn't feel like this, this is my final wish
The next time your truck rolls by
No matter how hard I cry
Please don't stop in front of me
Cause your loves no longer sweet
The next time I bring you change
Baby please pull back ya hand
You know your not what I need
Let me go, let me do B
(2x) You've got me chasing after you like a ice cream truck, I try my luck and catch up, but it's always out of luck
Faster and faster I ran
You sped up and then
Just as I thought I've caught up
I'm chasing you again
Finally,
You stopped and I jumped on
I realized your flavor was wrong
You thought I was still holding on
It's good to know your gone
The next time your truck rolls by
No matter how hard I cry
Please don't stop in front of me
Cause your love's no longer sweet
The next time I bring you change
Baby please pull back ya hand

Youre the only one I wish I could forget
The only one Id love to not forgive
And though you break my heart, youre the only one
And though there are times when I hate you
Cause I cant erase
The times that you hurt me
And put tears on my face
And even now while I hate you
It pains me to say
I know Ill be there at the end of the day
I dont wanna be without you babe

But sometimes I feel youre not deserving me
And still youre in my heart
But youre the only one and yes
There are times when I hate you
But I dont complain

to quite the storm that rages inside
the way that I hit my damage part
you gave me away
And I've had enough
I imagine the words I say to you
I'm finding strange to follow it trough
I'm ready to change
I'm letting go, I'm letting go
We're only friends, We're only friends
Tonight we'll let the music free our souls
So let it show, so let it show
We can pretend, we can pretend
We only find ourselves by loosing all
Control (x8)
I'm opening it up
show me a sign I can't relieve
It's crazy emotions flow trough me
I'm gonna explode
You take me away
and what is my ordinary life
I wont be afraid of what we might find a love I can hold
I'm letting go, I'm letting go
We're only friends, We're only friends
Tonight we'll let the music free our souls
So let it show, So let it show
We can pretend, we can pretend
We only find ourselves by loosing all
Control
Nothing injured nothing gained
New horizon ready to play
with every breath you take it away
I'm letting go, I'm letting go
We're only friends, We're only friends
Tonight we'll let the music free our souls
So let it show, So let it show
We can pretend, we can pretend
We only find ourselves by loosing all
Control (x8)"b"It really hurts to say this yes it does
But after a while sweet love just ain't enough
So many settle for less just because
Maybe I'm more in love with what it was
But what's gets so confusing baby
You and me
It's been so much confusion lately
You couldn't see that you were losing me
Well I'm alone now but I ain't lonely
I'm on my own now
But I ain't the only
Honestly I'm fine
I'll take this time to concentrate on me
And I got possibility to keep me company
Won't you just assume he doesn't care
To internalize it all isn't fare
So I address the problem so that he's aware
But I still feel all alone even when he's there
Maybe we can fix it baby
I know we can
If I make you miss it baby
Then maybe you will understand
That I'm alone now but I ain't lonely
I'm on my own now
But I ain't the only
Honestly I'm fine
I'll take this time to concentrate on me
And I got possibility to keep me company
la la la la la la la la laaa
la la la la la la la la laaa
la la la la la la la la laaa
la la la la la la la la laaa
Well I'm alone now but I ain't lonely
I'm on my own now
But I ain't the only
Honestly I'm fine
I'll take this time to concentrate on me
And I got possibility to keep me company"b"You're bad for me I clearly get it
I don't see how something good could come from loving you
The death of me must be your mission
Cause with every hug and kiss you're snatching every bit of strength
That I'm gon need to fight off the inevitable
And it's a heart breaking situation I'm up in, but I can't control
[Chorus]
You're just like poison
Slowly moving through my system
Breaking all of my defenses with time
You're just like poison and I just don't get it
How can something so deadly feel so right?
I'm not sure of what to do it's a catch 22
cause the cure is found in you I don't want it but I do
You're just like poison
My affliction, I'm addicted, I can't lie
Kiss me one more time before I die
[Verse 2]
You aint right take me high
Then that high it subsides
And my body flat lines
Then you come to revive
Wait wait wait I'm alive
But how long will it last
Will it all come crashing down?
How many doses am I needing now?
What's the prognosis will you be around?
Or am I just another victim of an assassin that broke my heart down
[Chorus]
Baby you're just like poison
Slowly moving through my system
Breaking all of my defenses with time
You're just like poison
And I just don't get it
How can something so deadly
Feel so right
I'm not sure what to do
It's a catch 22
Cause the cure is found in you
I don't want it but I do
You're just like poison
My affliction, I'm addicted, I cant lie
Kiss me one more time before I die
[Bridge]
It's just not my body (No)
It's my mind, you don't know
How many times I told myself
This cant do (cant do)
And that I don't need you (No I don't need you)(no)
It's so unfair(fair) that I find myself right back in your care(care)
And what's good is that when you're not always there (there there)
You're no good for my health (my heath)
You're just like poison (whoa whoa whoa) (repeat)
[Chorus]
You're just like poison
Slowly moving through my system
Breaking all of my defenses with time
You're just like poison
And I just don't get it
How can something so deadly
Feel so right
I'm not sure of what to do
It's a catch 22
Cause the cure is found in you
I don't want it but I do
You're just like poison
My affliction, I'm addicted, I cant lie
Baby Kiss me one more time
you're just like poison
Slowly moving through my system
Breaking all of my defenses with time
You're just like poison
And I just don't get it
How can something so deadly
Feel so right
I'm not sure what to do
It's a catch 22
Cause the cure is found in you
I don't want it to
You're just like poison
I'm addicted, I cant lie
Kiss me one more time
Before I die

IAM
Welcome
Welcome
Hey
Ohhhh
Beyonc - Chorus:
Welcome to a place
Where people lie to your face
Just to get it done.
Welcome to the human race
Where if you ain't got money, then you'll pay in pain
Welcome to this world of ours
And if you had the chance would you come back again ?
Cause now you're here there ain't no turning back,
You got tears in your eyes
And the monkey on your back (?)*
Akhenaton - Verse 1:
Bienvenue l o l'fort tue le faible, o la faim tue de fait
O la socit t'congratule, et t'accepte une fois la fortune faite,
O les dettes cumulent, o l'crdit accule, des tas d'foyers,
O les hommes en perte d'idaux, jurent qu'par les putes dvoyes en vido,
Chaque soir c'est la fte, les salons cossus attirent les fesses,
Sur les gros cads, qui arrosent les guridons de pure cocane,
Ici, les gosses rvent d't'Pirs, beaucoup partent et peu qui restent,
Nombreux sont ceux qui ds 13 ans connaissent leur premire ivresse,
Bienvenue l o l'air pollu, par les pots d'chappement dclenchent
Allergies en cascade, et taux record d'O3 dans les bronches,
Douleurs dans les hanches, rien plus d'dangereux qu'la faune humaine
Quand ils explosent un fourgon Brinks sans peine au Tri-Nitro-Tolune,
Les vices connus gnent la machine de l'Etat, les cabinets changent
Laissent la merde en tat, peu passent les menottes en mtal, on en est l
Ici 300 blinds font c'qui veulent, font comme s'ils vivent seuls
Ramnent tout leur p'tite gueule, quand mille meurent fauchs dans l'viseur
Bienvenue, aprs le 11 septembre on voque une aut'voie
Au silence : dis au revoir, l'enculeur d'aut'fois, dit baiser le monde haute voix
O les vieux des pays riches fantasment sur les m'mes de Bangkok
Pourquoi donc mettre part ces connards en taule
Ici on croit moins en Dieu qu'aux fant'mes, un hymne sanguinaire
On entonne, partout on sent la peur d'un peuple pass au pantone
L'hiver mange l't, et l'printemps parfois tue l'automne,
Crie Plus fort, les grands de c'monde, ont gar quelque part leur sonotone
Bienvenue, mes p'tits anges
Car voici c'monde
Beyonc - Chorus:
Welcome to a place

We all have a purpose in this world
We have to believe that we belong
Can't forget where we came from
We came from love.
Shurik'n - Verse 2:
Bienvenue dans c'truc entre enfer et paradis tant't l'un tant't l'autre.
Ange et dmon s'y disputent le parvis pour enjeu ceux qui s'y vautrent.
O l'on s'occupe de l'horreur seulement quand elle frappe nos portes.
O la rumeur tue sournoisement, vicieux coup de surin dans l'aorte.
O tu bouffes de la merde chaque jour et on te le dit qu'20 ans aprs.
Parce qu'en fait ils s'en tapent de c' qu'on pense on l'sait mais ils le diront jamais.
O on est trop con pour voir qu'un mec est bon bien avant qu'il meure
Puis on se vante de le connatre achetant ses tableaux visitant sa demeure
Bienvenue dans c'monde o on se dit tous gaux blague part l
L'caniveau l haut c'est les bureaux mais le mieux c'est au milieu
O on se sait si fragile qu'on prvoit les pices d'rechange
D'ici peu de temps on s'achtera des jambes en famille le dimanche
O tout le monde ne mange pas sa faim lieu de conflit sans fin
Crer dans le fond pour qu'un seul parvienne ses fins
La misre comme moyen o le suppos mort esclavage svit encore en divers lieux
Tu vois ! Il y a toujours des grains de poussire vaniteux qui s'prennent pour des dieux
Bienvenue pas Gattaca mais presque o seul l'lu vite la presse
On parque le reste en attendant que vieillesse se manifeste,
O on parle prslection, d'amlioration, transformation
Gntique, c'est pas magnifique une armada de super soldats de plomb
O on s'tue pour un bifteck ou un bifton
O on entend le mensonge aveugle, on voit pas l'illusion, envole la laine du mouton
Je t'annonce le sombre, parce que le clair, j'prfrerais qu'tu le dcouvre,
Allez petit ! Lance toi t'inquite fonce ! Moi, j'te couvre
Beyonc - Chorus:

So I just wanna testify, make it crystal clear
See I've been picked out to be picked on
Talked about, out my friends mouths
I've been beat down til He turned my life around
Seems like I always fall short of being worthy
Cause I ain't good enough but He still loves me
I aint no superstar, the spotlight aint shining on me
Cause I ain't good enough but He still loves me
I used to wake up somedays
And wish I'd stayed asleep
Cause I went to bed on top of the world
Today the world's on top of me
Now everybody's got opinions
They ain't been in my position
That it breaks my heart
When I hear what they have to say about me
Seems like I always fall short of being worthy
Cause I ain't good enough but He still loves me
I aint no superstar, the spotlight aint shining on me
Cause I ain't good enough but He still loves me
And I'm not perfect
Yes I do wrong
I'm trying my best
But it aint good enough
Shunned by the world
If I don't succeed
Cause I aint good enough
But He still loves me
If you ain't worthy just raise your hands
And let me know that you understand
That we are all so blessed to be loved, loved
Stand for him or fall for anything
Cause through his eyes we all look the same
What will we do without pain?
Seems like I always fall short of being worthy
Cause I ain't good enough but He still loves me
I aint no superstar, the spotlight aint shining on me
Cause I ain't good enough but He still love me
I'm not perfect
Yes I do wrong
I'm trying my best
But it aint good enough
Shunned by the world
If I dont succeed
Cause I aint good enough
But He still loves me
I'm not perfect
Yes I do wrong
I'm trying my best
But it aint good enough
Shunned be the word

In the closet that's my stuff, yes
If I bought it please don't touch
And keep talking that mess, that's fine
But could you walk and talk at the same time?
And it's my mine name that is on that tag
So remove your bags let me call you a cab
Standing in the front yard telling me
How I'm such a fool, talking about
How I'll never ever find a man like you
You got me twisted
You must not know 'bout me
You must not know 'bout me
I could have another you in a minute
Matter fact he'll be here in a minute, baby
You must not know 'bout me
You must not know 'bout me
I can have another you by tomorrow
So don't you ever for a second get to thinking you're irreplaceable
So go ahead and get gone
And call up that chick and see if she's home
Oops, I bet ya thought that I didn't know
What did you think I was putting you out for?
Because you was untrue
Rolling her around in the car that I bought you
Baby you dropped them keys
Hurry up before your taxi leaves
Standing in the front yard telling me
How I am such a fool, talking about
How I'll never ever find a man like you

Chorus until fade"b"He is always laughin' and flirting with me
And you act like you don't even care
As a matter of fact you've been real distance lately
Actin' like I'm not even there
He says that you don't deserve a girl like me
I'm startin' to think that he's right
Baby, if you let him take me from you
I guess I finally see
If you let him take me from you
You never wanted me
If this happen
Then it proves that your love was never true
If you let him take me from you, baby
If you let him take me from you
Why is that, when we go out
Out together as one big crew
I tried to chill with you, dance or whatever
And your homeboy is more interested than you
He pays more attention to me than you lately
I'm tended to pay attention too
Baby, if you let him take me from you
I guess I finally see
If you let him take me from you
You never wanted me
If this happen
Then it proves that your love was never true
If you let him take me from you, baby
If you let him take me from you
Boy, when I tried to show some affection to you
You act like you got better things to do
You want some lovin' that's when it's cool
But, baby boy, I'm not a fool
Baby, if you let him take me from you
I guess I finally see
If you let him take me from you
You never wanted me
(Wanted me)
If this happen, then it proves that your love was never true

If you let him take me from you
I guess I finally see
If you let him take me from you
No, no, you never wanted me
If this happen, then it proves that yourl ove was never true

Chorus:

I'm a bitch in the afternoon
Every now and then without warning
I can be really mean towards you
I'm a puzzle yes indeed
Ever complex in every way
And all the pieces aren't even in the box
And yet you see the picture clear as day
I don't know why you love me
And that's why I love you
You catch me when I fall
Accept me, flaws and all
And that's why I love you
And that's why I love you
And that's why I love
I neglect you when I'm working
When I need attention I tend to nag
I'm a host of imperfection
And you see past all that
I'm a peasant by some standards
But in your eyes I'm a queen
You see potential in all my flaws
And that's exactly what I need
I don't know why you love me
And that's why I love you
You catch me when I fall
Accept me, flaws and all
And that's why I love you
And that's why I love you
And that's why I love you
Don't know why you love me
And that's why I love you
Catch me when I fall
Accept me flaws and all
And that's why I love you
And that's why I love you
And that's why I love you
You, you, you"b"Verse 1:
It's really been weighing on me
Tell me what did I do
To have ya'll hating on me
When I don't have nothing to prove
Sometimes I shake my head
When I'm laying down in my bed
Thinking 'bout the things been said
When you really don't know me yet
Pre-Chorus:
Gotta clear up some things
There have been many things said about me
So many opinions, so many judgements, preconceived
It's out my character for me to feed into ya,
give it a rest
You must admire me spend so much time on me
consuming yo head...
Chorus:
I can't take no more
(I think its time for me to let it all out)
I can't take no more
(Why my name always up in yo mouth)
What you hate me for
(I'm so tired of all of these lies)
I can't take no more (hey), no more (no more), no more
Verse 2:
It's really been weighing on me
I'm not myself lately
I feel a little incomplete
But I'm not gone lose no sleep
I keep it all in my mind
Cause it gotta get better in time
Why don't you live your life
And let me live mine
Pre-Chorus:
Gotta clear up some things,
There have been many things said about me (said about me)
So many opinions, so many judgements, preconceived (preconceived)

You ready \'b\' Let\'s go get \'em..
Look for me! Young, be
Cruisin\' down the westside... highway
Doing what we like to do... our, way
Eyes behind shades, this necklace the reason
All of my dates been blind dates
But today, I got my thoroughest girl wit me
I\'m mashin\' the gas, she\'s grabbin\' the wheel, it\'s true to the heart
She rides with me - the new Bobby and Whitney
Only time we don\'t speak is during "Sex and the City"
She gets Carrie fever, but soon as the show is over
She\'s right back to being my soldier
\'Cause mami\'s a rider, and I\'m a roller
Put us together, how they gon\' stop both us?
What ever she lacks, I\'m right over her shoulder
When I\'m off track mami is keepin me focused
So let\'s, lock this down like it\'s supposed to be
The \'03 Bonnie and Clyde, Hov\' and be
[Chorus]
[Jay] All I need in this life of sin, is me and my girlfriend.
[Bey] Down to ride \'til the very end, it\'s me and my boyfriend.
[Jay] All I need in this life of sin, is me and my girlfriend.
[Bey] Down to ride \'til the very end, it\'s me and my boyfriend.
The problem is, you dudes treat the one that you lovin
With the same respect that you treat the one that you humpin
Now they \'bout nothin - if ever you mad about somethin
It won\'t be that; oh no it won\'t be that
I don\'t be at, places where we comfy at
With no be-atch; oh no you won\'t see that
And no, I ain\'t perfect - nobody walkin this earth\'s surface is
But girlfriend, work with the kid
I keep you workin that Hermes Burkin bag,
Manolo Blahnik, Timbs, aviator lens
600 drops, Mercedes Benz
The only time you wear Burberry to swim
And I don\'t have to worry, only worry is him
She do anything necessary for him
And I do anything necessary for her
So don\'t let the necessary occur, yep!
[Chorus]
(Talk to \'em B)
If I was your girlfried,
I\'ll be there for you, if somebody hurts you,
Even if that somebody is me
Yeah-hee (break it down for \'em)
Sometimes I trip on how happy we could be
And so I put this on my life
Nobody or nothing will ever come between us
And I promise I\'ll give my life
And all of my trust if you was my boyfriend
Put this on my life
The air that I breathe in, all that I believe in
I promise I\'ll give my life
My love and my trust if you was my boyfriend
[Chorus]'b"Hey yo, B
This a good look right here, yeah
Bad Boy, baby, uh
Hey yo, B
I've been wanting to explain to you what it is that you do to me
Got me open, I am so in love with loving you
Touching places, no one else has ever made me feel incredible
When you touch me, I feel sexy, no one else like you
Got me going off all the love you give me
I'd be crazy to ever want to leave
I love the way your hands belong over there
Please don't say you're gonna stop loving me
Ohh, keep giving your love to me
Ohh, keep giving your love to me
Ohh, when you're giving your love to me
Ohh, it's like you're making love to me

Ohh, the way you're giving your love to me
Ohh, it's like you're making love to me
I lose all control when you are here and baby, it amazes me
How could someone be so sexy and love like you do
Oh baby, do you understand the power that you posses over me
Can't accept this feeling and I don't think I want to
Got me going off all the love you give me
I'd be crazy to ever want to leave
I love the way your hands belong over there
Please don't say you're gonna stop loving me
Ohh, keep giving your love to me
Ohh, keep giving your love to me

It's all 'cause you love me the way you do
Don't want no other love but you
'Cause no one else has ever made me feel this good

Ohh, keep giving your love to me
Ohh, when you're giving your love to me
Ohh, it's like you're making love to me

A melody I start but can't complete
Listen to the sound from deep within
Its only beginning to find release
Oh the time has come for my dreams to be heard
They will not be pushed aside and turned
Into your own, all 'cause you won't listen
Listen, I am alone at a crossroads
I'm not at home in my own home
And I've tried and tried
To say what's on my mind
You should have known
Now I'm done believing you
You don't know what I'm feeling
I'm more than what
You've made of me
I followed the voice, you gave to me
But now I've gotta find my own
You should have listened
There was someone here inside
Someone I thought had died
So long ago
Oh I'm screaming out
And my dreams will be heard
They will not be pushed aside or turned
Into your own
All 'cause you won't listen
Listen, I am alone at a crossroads
I'm not at home in my own home
And I've tried and tried
To say what's on my mind
You should have known
Now I'm done believing you
You don't know what I'm feeling
I'm more than what
You've made of me
I followed the voice, you gave to me
But now I've gotta find my own
I don't know where I belong
But I'll be moving on
If you don't, if you won't
Listen to the song here in my heart
A melody I start, but I will complete
Now I am done believing you
You don't know not what I am feeling
I'm more than what you've made of me
I followed the voice you think you gave to me
But now I got to find my own, my own"b"It ain't for everybody

I still remember, I called you cryin\'
\'Cuz of my tattoo, coulda said, "Beyonce, I told ya so"
Instead you said you\'d get one too

Words can\'t express my boundless gratitude for you
I appreciate what you do, ohh

In the body that
I only want to share with you

Who has come here from Battle Creek.
As he walks with his Pepsi can,
He is bumped by the strangest man.
He feels no wish as he sees it roll,
Down the street to an open hole.
The taste sensation he loves so well,
Now is gone, and he starts to yell.
His Pepsi fell, he shows his lust (the joy of life)
The joy of life he needs it anyhow (the joy of life, the joy of taste)
He makes the sound of a tender bear (the joy of Pepsi)
As the crowd around him starts to swell.
Sir, a Pepsi please (the joy of life)
And they pack a Pepsi onto Zeke,
The Pepsi's found, the people cheer (the taste of Pepsi)
For the joy of Pepsi now is here!
Ba ba ba ba ba, ba ba ba ba ba, the Joy of Pepsi."b"To the left, to the left
To the left, to the left
To the left, to the left
Everything you own in the box to the left
In the closet that's my stuff, yes
If I bought it please don't touch
And keep talking that mess, that's fine
But could you walk and talk at the same time?
And it's my mine name that is on that tag
So remove your bags let me call you a cab
Standing in the front yard telling me
How I'm such a fool, talking about
How I'll never ever find a man like you
You got me twisted
You must not know 'bout me
You must not know 'bout me
I could have another you in a minute
Matter fact he'll be here in a minute, baby
You must not know 'bout me
You must not know 'bout me
I can have another you by tomorrow
So don't you ever for a second get to thinking you're irreplaceable
So go ahead and get gone
And call up that chick and see if she's home
Oops, I bet ya thought that I didn't know
What did you think I was putting you out for?
Because you was untrue
Rolling her around in the car that I bought you
Baby you dropped them keys
Hurry up before your taxi leaves
Standing in the front yard telling me
How I am such a fool, talking about
How I'll never ever find a man like you
You got me twisted
You must not know 'bout me
You must not know 'bout me
I can have another you in a minute
Matter fact he'll be here in a minute, baby
You must not know 'bout me
You must not know 'bout me
I'll have another you by tomorrow
So don't you ever for a second get to thinking you're irreplaceable
So since Im not your everything
How about I'll be nothing, nothing at all to you
Baby I won't shed a tear for you, I won't lose a wink of sleep
'Cause the truth of the matter is replacing you is so easy
To the left, to the left
To the left, to the left

You could pack all your things, we're finished

If you let him take me from you
You never wanted me
If this happen
Then it proves that your was never true
If you let him take me from you, baby
If you let him take me from you
Why is that, when we go out
Out together as one big crew
I tried to chill with you, dance or whatever
And your homeboy is more interested than you
He pays more attention to me than you lately
I'm tended to pay attention too

I guess I finally see
If you let him take me from you
You never wanted me
If this happen
Then it proves that your was never true
If you let him take me from you, baby
If you let him take me from you

You act like you got better things to do
You want some lovin' that's when it's cool
But, baby boy, I'm not a fool

I guess I finally see
If you let him take me from you
You never wanted me

Remember the first day when you smiled at me?
You stepped to me, and then you said to me,
I was the woman you dreamed about.
Remember the first day when you called my house?
Remember the first day when you took me out?
We had butterflies although we tried to hide it,
And we both had a beautiful night.
The way we held each other's hand,
The way we talked, the way we laughed,
It felt so good to find true love
I knew right then and there you were the one
ooh oh oooh
I know that he loves me, cause he told me so
I know that he loves me, cause his feelings show
When he stares at me, you see he cares for me
You see how he is so deep in love
I know that he loves me cause it's obvious
I know that he loves me cause it's me he trusts
And he's missing me, if he's not kissing me
And when he looks at me his brown eyes tell his soul
Remember the first day, the first day we kissed?
Remember the first day we had an arguement?
We apologized, and then we compromised
And we haven't argued since
Remember the first day we stopped playing games?
Remember the first day you fell in love with me?
It felt so good for you to say those words
Cause I felt the same way too
The way we held each other's hand,
The way we talked, the way we laughed
It felt soo good to fall in love
And I knew right then and there you were the one ooh oh ohhwoah
I know that he loves me, cause he told me so

And he's missing me, if he's not kissing me
And when he looks at me his brown eyes tell his soul.
I'm so happy, so happy that you're in my life
And baby now that you're a part of me
You showed me,
Showed me the true meaning of love (the true meaning of love)
And I know he loves me
I know that he loves me, cause he told me so
I know that he loves me, cause his feelings show
When he stares at me you see he cares for me
You see how he is so deep in love
I know that he loves me cause it's obvious
I know that he loves me cause it's me he trusts

He looks at me and his brown eyes...
Tell his soul"b"Why Me Lord, What have I ever done
To deserve even one Of the Pleasures I've known
Tell me Lord, What did I ever do
That was worth loving you Or the Kindness you've shown.
Lord help me Jesus, I've wasted it so
Help me Jesus I know what I am
Now that I know that I've needed you so
Help me Jesus, My Soul's in your Hand.
Try me Lord, If you think there's a Way
I can try to repay All I've taken from you
Maybe Lord, I can show someone else
What I've been through myself On my Way back to you.
Yes Lord, help me Jesus, I've wasted it so
Help me Jesus I know what I am
Now that I know that I've needed you so
Help me Jesus, My Soul's in your Hand."b"(Andre 3000)
I, I, I left no time to regret
Kept my dick wet with that same old bet
Oooh and you
You and your head high
And your tears dry
Get on without your guy
And I, I, I went back to what I knew
So far removed from all we been through
And you, and you, and you, you tread a troubled track
Your odds are always stacked
You'll go back to black

We only said goodbye with words
I died a hundred times
I go back to her and you go back to, you go back to
You go back to

I, I loved you much
It's not enough
I love blow and you love puff
And life, is like a pipe
And I'm a tiny penny rolling up the walls inside

We only said goodbye with words
I died a hundred times
You go back to her and I go back to
We only said goodbye with words
I died a hundred times
You go back to her
And I go back to, I go back to black"b"[Verse 1: Beyonce]
I've been watching for the signs
Took a trip to clear my mind
Now I'm even more lost
And you're still so fine, oh my oh my
Been having conversations about breakups and separations
I'm not feeling like myself since the baby
Are we gonna even make it? Oooh
Cause if we are, we're taking this a little too far
If we are, we're taking this a little too far
Baby, if we are, we're taking this a little too far
Me being wherever I'm at, worried about wherever you are
We're taking this a little too far
We're taking this a little too far
We're taking this a little too far

We ain't finished talking
I told you you don't need to worry about them bitches
All them fives need to listen when the ten is talking
Cuz they don't wanna see you happier than them and girl you swear they all
Your friends and there's been a problem
You the one they hate, just come with daddy
I know you think it's funny that your ex is not a running back
But that nigga came running back
And you tell me that you're done with that
And I believe it's true as long as you know who you belong to
[Outro: Beyonce]
All I'm really asking for is you
Long as you know who you belong to"b"[Verse 1]
When the palm of my two hands hold each other
That feels different
From when your hands are in mine
That's just the way it is
And when my voice is screaming out to my own ears
That feels different
From when I hear yours
Now thats just the way it is
And when I'm standing in this mirror
After all these years
What I'm viewing is a little different
From what your eyes show you
I guess I didn't see myself before you
Moving forward

And I thought the world would move on
I thought the world would move on
Without us, without us, without us
But nothing I know could slow us down
Couldn't slow us down
I thought I could live without you
Cause nothing I know can break us
Down
They can't break us down
[Verse 2]
And just like you I can't be scared
Just like you I hope I'm spared
But it's tough love
I know you feel it in the air
Even the babies know it's there
Tough love
Super power
The laws of the world tell us what goes sky
And what falls
It's a super power
Super power
The laws of the world never stopped us once
Cause together we got plenty super power

Cat calls on cat walks
Man these women getting solemn
I could sing a song for Solomon or a salamader
We took a flight at midnight
And now my mind can't help but wonder
How come?
Spoonfed pluralized eyes to find the beaches in the forest
When Im Looking off the edge
I preach my gutter can't help ignore it

We teach girls to shrink themselves
To make themselves smaller
We say to girls
"You can have ambition
But not too much
You should aim to be successful
But not too successful
Otherwise you will threaten the man"
Because I am female
I am expected to aspire to marriage
I am expected to make my life choices
Always keeping in mind that
Marriage is the most important
Now marriage can be a source of
Joy and love and mutual support
But why do we teach girls to aspire to marriage
And we don\'t teach boys the same?
We raise girls to each other as competitors
Not for jobs or for accomplishments
Which I think can be a good thing
But for the attention of men
We teach girls that they cannot be sexual beings
In the way that boys are
Feminist: the person who believes in the social
Political, and economic equality of the sexes

You rock hard
I rock steady
[Hook]
So rock right up to
The side of my mountain
Climb until you reach my peak babe, my peak, the peak
And reach right into the bottom of my fountain
I wanna play in your deep end, your deep end, the deep
Then dip me under where you can feel my river flowing flow
Hold me 'til I scream for air to breathe
Don't wash me over until my well runs dry
Send all your sins all over me babe, over me
Rock it 'til waterfalls
Rock it 'til waterfalls
Rock it 'til waterfalls
Bathe in these waterfalls
I do it like it's my profession
I gotta make a confession
I'm proud of all this bass
Lemme put it in your face
By the way
If you need a personal trainer or a therapist
I can be a piece of sunshine, inner peace, entertainer
Anything else that you may read between the lines
You and I create
Rockets and waterfalls
[Hook]
Hard rock steady rock hard rock steady
Rock hard rock steady rock hard rock steady
Don't you know that I give you
The loving if you need it
I give you my word
You can believe it
Your love feels like
All four seasons growing inside me
Life has a reason
Swimming
My love, your love lifting
Higher harder
Got me screaming to the lord, boy
Kiss me
Pray we don't overflow
Baby I know you can feel it pulse
Keeping the peak of my waterfall
Rock it baby, rock it baby 'til the water falls down
Damn
And I can't help but love the way we make love
Daddy, daddy
Ooh child, ooh now
Yes lord
Damn baby
Driving me cray

Feel nice tonight
Stay out all night
Like it's 1996
Pull out that porsche tonight
Front with your boys tonight
Buy out the bar tonight

I know you never lie to me
And you've always been faithful
And I know there ain't any other guys like you
That's why I strive, I'll be your happiness, oh yes, oh yes-I need my man
To feel like he's a man
To feel the need for questioning
Where he is or who he's with
He's more than my man
He's my best friend
To feel the need for checkin' in
Cause we got blind trust
Trust, trust, trust
We got blind trust
Trust, trust, trust
If we got blind trust"b"I love you

My happiest moments weren't complete
If you weren't by my side
You're my relation In connection to the sun
With you next to me There's no darkness I can't overcome
You are my raindrop I am the sea
With you and God,who's my sunlight I bloom and grow so beautifully
Baby, I'm so proud so proud to be your girl
You make the confusion Go all away
From this cold and messed up world

I am in love with you
You set me free
I can't do this thing
Called life without you here with me
'Cause I'm Dangerously In Love with you

Just keep lovin' me
The way I love you loving me
And I know you love me
Love me for who I am
'Cause years before I became who I am Baby you
Were my man
I know it ain't easy Easy loving me
I appreciate the love and dedication
From you to me
Later on in my destiny I see myself having
Your child I see myself being your wife
And I see my whole future in your eyes
Thought of all my love for you sometimes make me wanna cry
Realize all my blessings
I'm grateful To have you by my side

Well baby they're tumbling down
And they didn't even put up a fight
They didn't even make a sound
I found a way to let you in
But I never really had a doubt
Standing in the light of your halo
I've got my angel now
It's like I've been awakened
Every rule I had you breakin'
It's the risk that I'm takin'
I ain't never gonna shut you out
Everywhere I'm looking now
I'm surrounded by your embrace

Hit me like a ray of sun
Burning through my darkest nights
You're the only one that I want
Think I'm addicted to your light
I swore I'd never fall again
But this don't even feel like fallin'
Gravity came again
To pull me back to the ground again
It's like I've been awakened
Every rule I had you breakin'
It's the risk that I'm takin'
I ain't never gonna shut you out

To the song here in my heart
A melody I start but can't complete
Listen, to the sound from deep within
It's only beginning
To find release
Oh,
The time has come
For my dreams to be heard
They will not be pushed aside and turned
Into your own
All cause you won't
Listen....
[Chorus:]
Listen,
I am alone at a crossroads
I'm not at home, in my own home
And I've tried and tried
To say what's on my mind
You should have known
Oh,
Now I'm done believing you
You don't know what I'm feeling
I'm more than what you made of me
I followed the voice you gave to me
But now I gotta find my own..
You should have listened
There is someone here inside
Someone I'd thought had died
So long ago
Oh I'm screaming out, for my dreams to be heard
They will not be pushed aside or worked
Into your own
All cause you won't
Listen...
[Chorus]
I don't know where I belong
But I'll be moving on
If you don't....
If you won't....
LISTEN!!!...
To the song here in my heart
A melody I've started
But I will complete
Oh,
Now I'm done believing you
You don't know what I'm feeling
I'm more than what you've made of me
I followed the voice you think you gave to me
But now I gotta find my own..

that it was really met to be"b'I remember, when you used to take me
On a bike ride every day, on the bayou
(Remember that? We were inseparable)
And I remember when you could do no wrong
You come home from work and I jump in your arms when I saw you
(I was so excited)
I was so happy to see you, ooh
(So happy to see you)
Because you loved me, I overcome, yeah
And I\'m so proud of what you\'ve become, yeah
You\'ve given me such security
No matter what mistakes I make, you\'re there for me
You cure my disappointments
And you heal my pain
You understood my biz and you protected me
I treasure every year in place a comemory
And that\'s why, I want my unborn son
To be like, my daddy
I want my husband to be like, my daddy
There is no one else like, my daddy
And I thank you for lovin\' me
Daddy daddy, daddy daddy
Daddy daddy, daddy daddy
Daddy daddy, daddy daddy
Daddy daddy, daddy daddy
I still remember the expression on your face
When you found out I\'d been on a date and had a boyfriend
(My first boyfriend, you shoulda seen your face)
I still remember, I called you cryin\'
\'Cuz of my tattoo, coulda said, "Beyonce, I told ya so"
Instead you said you\'d get one too
(You and my momma said ya\'ll get one just like mine)
Words can\'t express my boundless gratitude for you
I appreciate what you do, ohh
You\'ve given me tight security
No matter what mistakes I know, you\'re there for me
You killed my disappointments and you heal my pain
You understood by biz and you protected me
I treasure every extraordinary memory, that\'s why
My unborn son to be like, my daddy
I want my husband to be like, my daddy
There is no one else like, my daddy
And I thank you for lovin\' me
Even if my man broke my heart today
No matter how much pain I\'m in, I will be okay
\'Cause I got a man in my life that can\'t be replaced
For this love is unconditional, it won\'t go away
I know I\'m lucky, know it ain\'t easy
For men who take care of their responsibilities
Love is overwhelming, Lord why did you pick me?
Can\'t stop my tears from falling, I love you so much daddy
([Inaudible] to be like my daddy)
(Thank you, you\'ve done so much for me, I love you, daddy)
([Inaudible] to be like my daddy)
I get so emotional daddy, every time I think of you

I get so emotional daddy, every time I think of you

There is no one else like my daddy

You've got me
You've got me
You've got me
You've got me speechless
Where you been, baby?
Waited for you all day
Waited for you to use the key
That opens my place
My heart starts trembling
As I hear your footsteps pace
Lock opens, doorknob turns
There appears your face
Going out' my head--I think I'm loosing all my mind
Drive me crazy burning candles, making love all night
Feels so strange--it feels so crazy to be in your world
In your arms, lost for words--you've got me
[Chorus]
Laying so closely, I feel your skin rubbing and touching me
Only sweat between us, feeling you kissing and pleasing me
I rub your back, I kiss your neck--I know that you love when we touch like that
I can feel you need me--feels so good to me, feels so good to me
Going out' my head--I think I'm loosing all my mind
Drive me crazy burning candles, making love all night
Feels so strange--it feels so crazy to be in your world
In your arms, lost for words--you've got me
[Chorus]
Yes, yes, yes
Yes, yes, yes
Speechless
All I can say is
Yes, yes, yes
All I can say is
Yes, yes, yes
Kiss me
Hold me
You've got me
Speechless"b"The cards never lie, my last breath a sigh
And now I think about if it's my time to die
I don't know what I was thinking, steady wasting time with Hill
And I need to live my life because my time is unforgivable
I can't understand how my life changed around
Manifest my destiny, is it the brown on the grown?
Blue skies are turning gray it's the point of indecision
Leaving in the car and much be spent on television
Oh girlfriend, get your mind on right
Don't spend your time 'cause you can't waste your time
Everyday like it's your last but you must feed the mind
Intervention comes and snatch up all your dreams from behind
Love, you feel it and you got to let them know it
Love, your heart and that's the feeling that you go with
If you have a dream you need to go and let them know it
'Cause you could wake up in the morning and it could be over
No, no, no, no
I don't wanna, I don't wanna, I don't wanna go
Just, just, just let me stay home
Let me live my dream, let me see another dawn
No, no, no, no
I don't wanna, I don't wanna, I don't wanna go
Just, just, just let me stay home
Let me live my dream, let me see another dawn
Carmen, don't listen 'cause the cards have deceit
Just slide him the money, we don't need a receipt
Truth only exists within the eyes of the beholder
Plus he's kind of young for fortune telling
He probably should be older
But the cards never lie, I thought I told you
Now it's her turn to try, to reach her goals
Before she reaches the light
This is love
It's like I'm trying to throw my life away
Sometimes love is all you got
And other times it makes you pay
Well, when you finally rise
Then you'll realize
The windows to the soul are not the hips but the eyes
Oh you could wish on the stars but they dead, just a lie
But they shine just as bright as they did their entire life
No, no, no, no
I don't wanna, I don't wanna, I don't wanna go
Just, just, just let me stay home
Let me live my dream, let me see another dawn
No, no, no, no
I don't wanna, I don't wanna, I don't wanna go
Just, just, just let me stay home
Let me live my dream, let me see another dawn"b"Listen to the song here in my heart

Come in my bedroom and turn off the lights
You whisper softly in my ear
Makes me unwind
The way you touch me let's me know you're mine
I'd rather be with you
Because I love the way you scream my name
And there's no other man that gives me what I want
And makes me feel this way

An open face, the pain erased
Now the sky is clearer, I can see the sun
Now that all is, all is said and done, oh
There you are always strong when I need you
You let me give and now I live
Fearless and protected with the one I will love
After all is, all is said and done
I once believed that hearts were made to bleed
(Inside I once believed that hearts were made to bleed, oh baby)
But now I'm not afraid to say
I need you, I need you so stay with me
These precious hours
(Precious, yeah)
Greet each dawn in open arms
And dream, into tomorrow
Where there's only love
After all is, all is said and done
(Yeah baby)
Oh baby
(Inside I once believed, that hearts were meant to bleed)
(I'll never)
I'll never be afraid to say
I need you, I need you, so here
So here we are in the still of this moment
Fear is gone, hope lives on
We found our happy ending
For there's only love
(Only love)
And this sweet, sweet love
After all is, all is said and done
Yeah baby, after all is
(All is)
All is said and done"b"Every step I make
And every breath I take
I took 'cause I can't wait
To be closer to you
Baby, you're so sweet
You give me cavities
I get a stomach ache
If I can't be with you
At night I fall asleep
And I don't want to wake up
'Cause you are in my dreams
A heavenly creation
In the body that
I only want to share with you
Hey
[Chorus]
Everything I do is just for you
Countin' every second till we rendezvous
And I can't wait
To give my love to you
'Cause everything I do is just for you
Baby, we will never finish
To be continued
Separation can't change
The love I feel for you
I'm gonna definitely be affectionate
Snuggle up tonight--let's get real intimate
'Cause only you can satisfy my appetite
'Cause when it comes to love
You get me get so excited
When I taste your lips
My body melts in bliss every time
[Chorus: x2]
You are my (you are my)
Universe (universe)
Everything I want and
Everything I need and
Everything worth waiting for
For better or for worse
Constant craving
Your love enslaves me, oh
[Chorus]
Give it to me, baby
I want to give it to you
Give it to me, baby
I can't wait
'Cause everything I do is just for you
Everything I do is just for you
Countin' every second till we rendezvous
I can't wait
'Cause everything I do is just for you
Everything I do is just for you
Countin' every second till we rendezvous
And I can't wait
To give my love to you
'Cause everything I do is just for you"b"Oh my god

But I'll be damned if I see another chick on your arm
Won't you ring the alarm, I been through this too long
But I'll be damned if I see another chick on your arm
She gon' be rockin' chinchilla coats, if I let you go
Hit in the house off the coast, if I let you go
She gon' take everything I own, if I let you go
I can't let you go, damn, if I let you go
She gon' rock them VVS stones, if I let you go
In the 'Bach or the Rolls, if I let you go
She gon' profit everything I taught, if I let you go
I can't let you go, damn, if I let you go
Tell me how should I feel when I know what I know
And my female intuition tellin' me you a dog
People told me 'bout the flames I couldn't see through the smoke
When I need answers, accusations what you mean you gon' choke
You can't stay, you gotta go
Ain't no other chick spendin' your dough
This is taking a toll, the way the story unfolds
Not the picture perfect movie everyone would've saw
She gon' be rockin' chinchilla coats, if I let you go
Hit in the house off the coast, if I let you go
She gon' take everything I own, if I let you go
I can't let you go, damn, if I let you go
She gon' rock them VVS stones, if I let you go
In the 'Bach or the Rolls, if I let you go
She gon' profit everything I taught, if I let you go
I can't let you go, damn, if I let you go
Ring the alarm, I been through this too long
But I'll be damned if I see another chick on your arm
Won't you ring the alarm, I been through this too long
But I'll be damned if I see another chick on your arm
Tell me how should I feel when you made me belong
And the thought of you just touchin' her is what I hate most
I don't want you, but I want it and I can't let it go
To know you give it to her like you gave it to me, come on
He's so arrogant and bold
But she gon' love that shit, I know
I done put in a call, time to ring the alarm
'Cause you ain't never seen a fire like the one I'ma 'cause
She gon' be rockin' chinchilla coats, if I let you go
Hit in the house off the coast, if I let you go
She gon' take everything I own, if I let you go
I can't let you go, damn, if I let you go
She gon' rock them VVS stones, if I let you go
In the 'Bach or the Rolls, if I let you go
She gon' profit everything I taught, if I let you go
I can't let you go, damn, if I let you go
Ooh, how can you look at me
And not see all the things that I kept only just for you
Ooh, why would you risk it babe
Is that the price that I pay, ooh
But this is my show, and I won't let you go
All it's been paid for, and it's mine
How could you look at me
And not see all the things
She gon' be rockin' chinchilla coats, if I let you go
Hit in the house off the coast, if I let you go
She gon' take everything I own, if I let you go
I can't let you go, damn, if I let you go
She gon' rock them VVS stones, if I let you go
In the 'Bach or the Rolls, if I let you go
She gon' profit everything I taught, if I let you go
I can't let you go, damn, if I let you go"b'Spanish version of Listen

I wish I could look in your eyes
And tell you how I feel right now inside
Baby, I know that it's real
So real, so real, so real
How I wish I could be with you
How I wish, how I wish, how I wish I could be with you right now
Every morning, every afternoon, every night
I want to be with you
It don't matter if we go to the park or watch a play, stay in the hotel room all day
I just want to be with you
I love everything about you from your old school tennis shoes
To the way you move when you're dancing with me
Do you remember our first kiss?
It wasn't long enough
Remember the first time we spent those weeks together
They were not long enough
All of our conversations
All of your sweet pages
They're never long enough
When it's time for me to leave
It's so hard to say goodbye
I never want to say goodbye
I never ever want to say goodbye
One day we'll make love
Finally I'll be yours
Only you, only you
I could love you
It's too late
I already love you
I love you
I love you
I love you
I love you"b"I love you
I love you, I love you
Baby, I love you, you are my life
My happiest moments weren't complete if you weren't by my side
You're my relation in connection to the sun
With you next to me there's no darkness I can't overcome
You are my raindrops, I am the seed
With you and God who's the sunlight I bloom and grow so beautifully
Baby, I'm so proud, proud to be your girl
You make the confusion go all away from this cold and mixed-up world
I am in love with you
You set me free
I can't do this thing called life without you here with me
'Cause I'm dangerously in love with you
I'll never leave
Just keep lovin' me the way I love you loving me
'Cause I am in love with you
You set me free
I can't do this thing called life without you here with me
'Cause I'm dangerously in love with you
I'll never leave
Just keep lovin' me the way I love you loving me
And I know you love me, love me for who I am
'Cause years before I became who I am, baby, you were my man
I know it ain't easy, easy loving me
I appreciate the love and dedication from you to me
Later on in my destiny I see myself having your child
I see myself being your wife and I see my whole future in your eyes
Thought of all my love for you sometimes make me want to cry
Realize all my blessings; I'm grateful to have you by my side
I am in love with you
You set me free
I can't do this thing called life without you here with me
'Cause I'm dangerously in love with you
I'll never leave
Just keep lovin' me the way I love you loving me
'Cause I am in love with you
You set me free
I can't do this thing called life without you here with me
'Cause I'm dangerously in love with you
I'll never leave
Just keep lovin' me the way I love you loving me
Every time I see your face my heart smiles
Every time it feels so good it hurts sometimes
Created in this world to love, to hold
To feel, to breathe, to live you
Dangerously in love
I am in love with you
You set me free
I can't do this thing called life without you here with me
'Cause I'm dangerously in love with you
I'll never leave
Just keep lovin' me the way I love you loving me
'Cause I am in love with you
You set me free
I can't do this thing called life without you here with me

And it came so effortlessly after I finished
The film of my life 'Dreamgirls'
Because I was so inspired by Deena
I wrote songs that were saying all the things
I wish she woulda said in the film
And I wanted to give you an extra special song
That Deena sings, it's a pivotal moment
When Deena finally does get the strength to stand up for herself
And does know who she is, and knows what she wants
I'm sure all of you women can relate to the lyrics
This is Listen"b"The closer I get to you
The more you make me see
By giving me all you've got (tell me more)
Your love has captured me
Over and over again
I try to tell myself that we
Could never be more than friends
When all the while inside
I knew it was real
The way you make me feel
Lying here next to you
Time just seems to fly
Needing you more and more
Let's give love a try (let's give love a try)
Sweeter than sweeter love grows
And heaven's there for those
Who fool the tricks of time
With hearts in love will find
True love in a special way
The closer I get to you, baby
The more you make me see (the more you make me see)
By giving me what you've got
Your love captured me
Over and over again
I try to tell myself that we
Could never be more than friends
When all the while inside
I knew this was real (got to be real)
The way you make me feel (you know, you know, you know)
My baby, my baby, my baby, my love, my love, my love, my love
(Come closer love) Come a little closer so that we can see into the eyes of love
I wanna see into those eyes of love
(Come closer love) Just a little a closer let me speak to you
I want to softly tell you something
Here I am, here's my love; I just want you to come closer
Come a little closer, let me whisper in your ear
'Cause I want to tell you something
I wanna whisper in your ear so soft, so come closer love
Move on in real close so we can celebrate the way we feel about each other's lovin'
Wanna tell you words, words of love, words that make you wanna"b"When I First met u
U told me exactly how it would be
U had a lady
And couldn't spend all ur time with me
I only wanted to kick it
So i said boo u can keep her
Long as u satisfy me
But as the weeks went by
I, I started feeling strange
Sumthin was deep in my heart
Sumthin I can't explain
I think I'm fallin in love with u boy
I'm needin u so much
I'm cryin just 2 feel ur touch
I gotta leave u
I didn't wanna a man
I didn't wanna fall in love and
I didn't care about ur girl
I didn't care how we would end up

Now i realized that i gotta move on
It might be hard but, i

[Verse]
You say that he's wrong
You say that he's no good
Leave him alone
'cause he's gonna hurt you
But what they don't know is how he makes me feel
You say that he creeps
Always running the streets
He's playing the game
And he'll never love me
You say that he's fake
But why does it feel so real
[Pre-Chorus]
No matter what you say I ain't goin no where
No matter what you think I'ma always be there
The love that we share it lives inside of me
(The love that we share it lives inside of me)
No matter what you hear-ing, its all in the past
No matter what you feel-ing his love is gon last
The heart of his soul it breathes inside of me
(The heart of his soul it breathes inside of me)
[Chorus]
He's my man
(He makes me feel so special)
My man
(He makes me feel so precious)
My man

He's thuged out but he's my man
[Verse]
You say you don't trust him
Be'cause he's been locked up
You say he in trouble
'cause he out in a strip club
But you were young once
So you should understand
You say that you know
Say you've been a witness
You say it's for sure
Say he got a mistress
Until you can show me
I'm gon stand by him
[Pre-Chorus]
No matter what you say I ain't goin no where
No matter what you think I'ma always be there
The love that we share it lives inside of me
(The love that we share it lives inside of me)
No matter what you hear-ing, its all in the past

Walking up to me like they know me
You were the one that stayed aside
Waited awhile and took your time
You dont know how impressing
Your curiosity was to me
It was the fourth day of July
Looked in my eyes and saw that I
I wanted more than just a man, I needed a friend
Someone I can talk to, someone who really listens
When you touched my hand, the sun got brighter then
Trusting you, I closed my eyes and felt our love begin
It was the summertime
When we fell in love it was the summertime
Heaven shined on us it was the summertime
Baby, there is nothing like the summertime, summertime
Now its been a year and were closer
Fall in love again when I hold ya
I know that God set you aside for me
And now you are my prize
Wanna grow old witcha
And fill our house with your pictures
Have a son for you, a little girl for me
Together well raise a family
Baby, youre more than just a man, you are my best friend
Someone I can talk to someone who really listens
When you touched my hand the sun got brighter then
Trusting you I closed my eyes and felt our love begin
It was the summertime
When we fell in love it was the summertime
Heaven shined on us it was the summertime
Baby, there is nothing like the summertime, summertime
It was the summertime
When we fell in love it was the summertime
Heaven shined on us it was the summertime
Baby, there is nothing like the summertime, summertime'b"Ooh, ooh, ahh
Star, star
I'm wishing
I'm wishing
On a star
I'm wishing on a star
To follow where you are
I'm wishing on a dream
To follow what it means
And I'm wishing on the rainbows that I see
I'm wishing on the people who really dream
And I'm wishing on tomorrow rain never comes
And I'm wishing on all of the things we never done
I never thought I'd see the time when you would be
So far away from home
So far away from me
Just think of all the moments that we spent
I just can't let you go from me, we were meant
I didn't mean to hurt you, but I know
In the game of love, you reap what you sow
(Sow)
I feel it's time we should make up baby
I feel it's time for us to get back together
And make the best of things, oh baby
When we're together whether or never
I feel, it's time we should make up baby
I feel, it's time for us to get back together
And make the best of things, oh baby
When we're together
(Let's get together, baby)
Whether or never
I'm wishing on a star
To follow where you are
I'm wishing on a dream
To follow what it means
And I'm wishing on the rainbows that I see
I'm wishing on the people who really dream
Hoping all the days to come and days to go
Hoping on the days of loving, loving you so
Wishing on a star, wishing on a dream
Baby, forgive me
Lets make up, I'm sorry
Lets be together, breakup? Never
The love we have seems special so far
'Til we get back, I'm wishing on a star"b"Chorus
[B] Yo where the brother by my side at?
[M] Yo you really need to stop that
[B] Get it right!
[M] It's not even like that
[B] Try to get a job before we livin outta box black
[M]Put it on that and here's ya demo you can shop dat
[Beyonce]
It's funny how things turn around
Last night you tryna get down you act like you down
Any other time it's like you steady hatin on Brown
I'm tryna see my name in lights you tryna short it out the ground
[Mekhi]
You're the one that's got it twisted cause I'm right by your side
I had a bad day you jumpin' on my back for a ride
What can a man say I'm on the run, just for your auditionin
Callin on you every night it's like you never listenin
[Beyonce]
You're the one that's switchin up gettin to specifics
When you say that I'm just dreamin I be rollin like a Misholin (?)
[Mekhi]
Carmen you just trippin cause you know I love you infinite
Just so we could be here look at everything I did for this
[Beyonce]
So why you actin like that
You don't have to take it anymore fight back
I came to far to turn around and just hike back
Trying to get me sidetracked see me on the corner where the sign of the time
at
Chorus x2
[Beyonce]
And yo I came from the projects now I want the condos
Trying to be a star and now you messin up my cosmo
[Mekhi]
But you can't find something if you walkin' wit a blindfold
Carmen I can see right through you with my eyes closed
[B]Grown man to finance
[M]You actin like a nuisance
[B]You're the one that's in the club and tryin to do a new dance
[Mekhi]
Songs you got me singin like my name was Bobbly Blubland
Don't make me sing 'em cause the game you playin baby two can"b"All the ladies if you feel me help me sing it out
I can't believe I believed
Everything we had would last
So young and naive for me to think
She was from your past
Silly of me to dream of
One day having your kids
Love is so blind
It feels right when its wrong
I can't believe I fell for four years
I'm smarter than that
So dumb and naive to believe that with me
You're a changed man
Foolish of me to compete
When you cheat with loose women
It took me some time but now I've moved on
'Cause I realized I got
Me, myself, and I
That's all I got in the end
That's what I found out
And it ain't no need to cry
I took a vow that from now on
I'm a be my own best friend
Me, myself and I
That's all I got in the end
That's what I found out
And it ain't no need to cry
I took a vow that from now
I'm a be my own best friend
Your so controlling, you say that you love me
But you don't
Your family told me one day
I would see it on my own
Next thing I know I'm dealing
With your three kids in my home
Love is so blind it feels right when its wrong
Now that its over
Stop calling me
Come pick up yo clothes
No need to front like ya still wit me
All your homies know
Even your very best friend
Tried to warn me on the low
It took me some time
But now I am strong
'Cause I realized I got
Me, myself, and I
That's all I got in the end
That's what I found out
And it ain't no need to cry
I took a vow that from now on
I'm a be my own best friend
I got me, myself, and I
Must have cried a thousand times
I can't regret time spent with you
But I lucked out to make it through"b"I wish I could believe you
Then I'll be alright
But now ev'rything you told me
Really don't apply
To the way I feel inside
Lovin' you was easy once upon a time
But now my suspicions of you have multiplied
And it's all because you lied
I only give you a hard time
'Cause I can't go on and pretend like
I haven't tried to forget this
But I'm much too full of resentment
Just can't seem to get over the way you hurt me
Don't know how you gave another
Who didn't mean a thing, no
The very thing you gave to me
I thought I could forgive you
And I know you've changed
As much as I wanna trust you
I know it ain't the same
And it's all because you lied
I only give you a hard time
'Cause I can't go on and pretend like
I haven't tried to forget this
But I'm much too full of resentment
I may never understand why
I'm doing the best that I can, and I
I tried and I tried to forgive this
But I'm much too full of resentment
I'll always remember feelin'
Like I was no good
Like I couldn't do it for you
Like your mistress could
And it's all because you lied
Loved you more than ever
More than my own life
The best part of me I gave you
It was sacrificed
And it's all because you lied
I only give you a hard time
'Cause I can't go on and pretend like
I tried and I tried to forgive this
But I'm damn too full of resentment
I know she was attractive
But I was here first
Been ridin' with you for six years
Why did I deserve
To be treated this way by you, you?
I know you're prob'ly thinkin'
What's up with B?
I've been cryin' for too long
What did you do to me?
I used to be so strong
But now you took my soul
I'm cryin', can't stop cryin'
Can't stop cryin'
You could've told me that you wasn't happy
I know you didn't wanna hurt me
Look what you've done to me now
I gotta look at her in her eyes
And see she's had half of me
How could you lie?
(You lied)"b'Out of all the guys that approach me
Walking up to me like they know me
You were the one that stayed aside
Waited awhile and took your time
You dont know how impressing
Your curiosity was to me
It was the fourth day of July
Looked in my eyes and saw that I
I wanted more than just a man, I needed a friend
Someone I can talk to, someone who really listens
When you touched my hand, the sun got brighter then
Trusting you, I closed my eyes and felt our love begin
It was the summertime
When we fell in love it was the summertime
Heaven shined on us it was the summertime
Baby, there is nothing like the summertime, summertime
Now its been a year and were closer
Fall in love again when I hold ya
I know that God set you aside for me
And now you are my prize
Wanna grow old witcha
And fill our house with your pictures
Have a son for you, a little girl for me
Together well raise a family
Baby, youre more than just a man, you are my best friend
Someone I can talk to someone who really listens
When you touched my hand the sun got brighter then
Trusting you I closed my eyes and felt our love begin
It was the summertime
When we fell in love it was the summertime
Heaven shined on us it was the summertime
Baby, there is nothing like the summertime, summertime
It was the summertime
When we fell in love it was the summertime
Heaven shined on us it was the summertime
Baby, there is nothing like the summertime, summertime'b"To the left, to the left
To the left, to the left
To the left, to the left
Everything you own in the box to the left
In the closet that's my stuff, yes
If I bought it please don't touch
And keep talking that mess, that's fine
But could you walk and talk at the same time?
And it's my mine name that is on that tag
So remove your bags let me call you a cab
Standing in the front yard telling me
How I'm such a fool, talking about
How I'll never ever find a man like you
You got me twisted
You must not know 'bout me
You must not know 'bout me
I could have another you in a minute
Matter fact he'll be here in a minute, baby
You must not know 'bout me
You must not know 'bout me
I can have another you by tomorrow
So don't you ever for a second get to thinking you're irreplaceable
So go ahead and get gone
And call up that chick and see if she's home
Oops, I bet ya thought that I didn't know
What did you think I was putting you out for?
Because you was untrue
Rolling her around in the car that I bought you
Baby you dropped them keys
Hurry up before your taxi leaves
Standing in the front yard telling me
How I am such a fool, talking about
How I'll never ever find a man like you
You got me twisted
You must not know 'bout me
You must not know 'bout me
I can have another you in a minute
Matter fact he'll be here in a minute, baby
You must not know 'bout me
You must not know 'bout me
I'll have another you by tomorrow
So don't you ever for a second get to thinking you're irreplaceable
So since Im not your everything
How about I'll be nothing, nothing at all to you
Baby I won't shed a tear for you, I won't lose a wink of sleep
'Cause the truth of the matter is replacing you is so easy
To the left, to the left
To the left, to the left
To the left, to the left
Everything you own in the box to the left
To the left, to the left
Don't you ever for a second get to thinking you're irreplaceable
You must not know 'bout me
You must not know 'bout me
I can have another you in a minute
Matter fact he'll be here in a minute, baby
You must not know 'bout me
You must not know 'bout me
I can have another you by tomorrow
So don't you ever for a second get to thinking, baby
You must not know 'bout me
You must not know 'bout me
I can have another you in a minute
Matter fact he'll be here in a minute
You could pack all your things, we're finished
(You must not know 'bout me)
'Cause you made your bed, now lay in it
(You must not know 'bout me)
I can have another you by tomorrow
Don't you ever for a second get to thinking you're irreplaceable"b"Took me a while but I'm finally here
So I just wanna testify, make it crystal clear
See I've been picked out to be picked on
Talked about, out my friends mouths
I've been beat down til He turned my life around
Seems like I always fall short of being worthy
Cause I ain't good enough but He still loves me
I aint no superstar, the spotlight aint shining on me
Cause I ain't good enough but He still loves me
I used to wake up somedays
And wish I'd stayed asleep
Cause I went to bed on top of the world
Today the world's on top of me
Now everybody's got opinions
They ain't been in my position
That it breaks my heart
When I hear what they have to say about me
Seems like I always fall short of being worthy
Cause I ain't good enough but He still loves me
I aint no superstar, the spotlight aint shining on me
Cause I ain't good enough but He still loves me
And I'm not perfect
Yes I do wrong
I'm trying my best
But it aint good enough
Shunned by the world
If I don't succeed
Cause I aint good enough
But He still loves me
If you ain't worthy just raise your hands
And let me know that you understand
That we are all so blessed to be loved, loved
Stand for him or fall for anything
Cause through his eyes we all look the same
What will we do without pain?
Seems like I always fall short of being worthy
Cause I ain't good enough but He still loves me
I aint no superstar, the spotlight aint shining on me
Cause I ain't good enough but He still love me
I'm not perfect
Yes I do wrong
I'm trying my best
But it aint good enough
Shunned by the world
If I dont succeed
Cause I aint good enough
But He still loves me
I'm not perfect
Yes I do wrong
I'm trying my best
But it aint good enough
Shunned be the word
If I don't succeed
Cause I ain't good enough
But He still loves me
No, I ain't good enough
But He still loves me
No, I ain't good enough
But He still loves me
No, I aint good enough
But He still loves me
No, I ain't good enough
But He still loves me
(But the Lord still loves me)"b"I love you
I love you, I love you
Baby, I love you, you are my life
My happiest moments weren't complete if you weren't by my side
You're my relation in connection to the sun
With you next to me there's no darkness I can't overcome
You are my raindrops, I am the seed
With you and God who's the sunlight I bloom and grow so beautifully
Baby, I'm so proud, proud to be your girl
You make the confusion go all away from this cold and mixed-up world
I am in love with you
You set me free
I can't do this thing called life without you here with me
'Cause I'm dangerously in love with you
I'll never leave

And I know you love me, love me for who I am
'Cause years before I became who I am, baby, you were my man
I know it ain't easy, easy loving me
I appreciate the love and dedication from you to me
Later on in my destiny I see myself having your child
I see myself being your wife and I see my whole future in your eyes
Thought of all my love for you sometimes make me want to cry
Realize all my blessings; I'm grateful to have you by my side
I am in love with you
You set me free
I can't do this thing called life without you here with me
'Cause I'm dangerously in love with you
I'll never leave
Just keep lovin' me the way I love you loving me

'Cause I'm dangerously in love with you
I'll never leave
Just keep lovin' me the way I love you loving me
Every time I see your face my heart smiles
Every time it feels so good it hurts sometimes
Created in this world to love, to hold
To feel, to breathe, to live you
Dangerously in love
I am in love with you
You set me free
I can't do this thing called life without you here with me
'Cause I'm dangerously in love with you
I'll never leave
Just keep lovin' me the way I love you loving me
'Cause I am in love with you
You set me free
I can't do this thing called life without you here with me

[Outro: 50 Cent]
Hahaha
Don\'t try to act like you don\'t know where we been either
We in da club all the time, it\'s about to pop off
Hahaha'b"Beyonce' - You know you really, really, really, really,
want to be with me
So why don't you stop beating around the bush
and come and give it to me
Derek we can make beautiful music together
if you only stop resisting the only woman that you really want
and its not wifey
Mekhi - Hey! You're real social
I don't like the way you're looking
Don't get too close
I'm about to take you down to booking
Beyonce' - C'mon and touch me D I know you want to
Mekhi - Look, I only need your prints,
don't really care about your frontal
Beyonce' - I don't see me living another day
without your tender kisses
Why don't we retire to the room,
put on some Luther, light some incents
Get to know one another just a little better
than we do now
Mekhi - You trying to act like I'm not a cop
Beyonce' - You can bring the cuffs, if you would like to,
if that's your style
Mekhi - Looks let's get it straight, you cease and disist
I got some platinum bracelets
I'm about to squeeze on ya wrists
Beyonce' - But you don't understand the way that I feel,
the pain I could heal
Mekhi - I could lose my job for this,
there is no way we could chill
Beyonce' - So why you bring me this far,
now let's try to be real
Cause only time will reveal
if you still playing the field
Every second that you stay is like an hour we will
I got a couple days to kill,
either you down or you peel
I don't want anything without you in my life,
you are my baby
Why don't you forget about your girl
and say you want me as your lady
Get to know one another just a little better
than we do now
Give in to everything you're feeling that's surprising
Let's make love now
Mekhi - Nah, I don't think so,
your body is like weed smoke though
Light-headed, feel ya eyes saying please don't go
Beyonce' - It ain't about getting locked
cause it's your steeze I need
My heart don't lie, come over D and feel my beat
Mekhi - Oh no! Cause I can see your skin is soft
You know, but I dont wanna pay the cost to be with you
Beyonce' - You can't deny your feelings for us,
you know it's true
Mekhi - I gotta girl, but really now I'm feeling you
I wanna do it, but I don't
You know, I'd feel your vibe, but I'm so full of decency
Beyonce' - Go with your instints and I'm sure it leads to me
There's only one way to see if it is to be..."b"Baby, seem like everywhere I go I see you
From your eyes I smile, it's like I breathe you
Helplessly I reminisce, don't want to
Compare nobody to you
Boy, I try to catch myself but I'm outta control
Your sexiness is so appealing, I can't let it go, baby
Know that I can't get over you, 'cause everything I see is you
And I don't want no substitute, baby, I swear it's deja vu
Know that I can't get over you, 'cause everything I see is you
And I don't want no substitute, baby, I swear it's deja vu
Baby, I can't go anywhere without thinking that you're there
Seems like you're everywhere, it's true, gotta be having deja vu
'Cause in my mind I want you here, get on the next plane, I don't care
I'm missing you, that I'm having deja vu
Boy, I try to catch myself but I'm outta control

I ain\'t mad at you, it\'s just my Clyde
Way I wear my hat to the side
Way I lean real low when I ride
That\'s why my minds, they like my walk

My way of thinking is slightly off
They like the way he floss
Leave the block on a bike, he come back on a Porsche
But of course
Most of all, they like my honesty, integrity, my loyalty

Its really being weighing on me
Tell me what did i do
To have yall hatin on me
When i dont have nothin to prove
Sometimes i shake my head when im laying down in my bed
Thinking about the things being said when you really dont know me
(HOOK)
Gotta clear up somethings there have been many things said about me
So many opinions so many judgements preconceived
It's outta my character for me to feed in to ya,give it a rest
You must admire me spend so much time with me consuming your head
(CHORUS)
I cant take nomore
Think its time for me to let it all out
I cant take nomore
Why my name always up in your mouth
What you hate me for
Im so tired all of these lie
I cant take nomore nomore nomore

You're my relation In connection to the sun
With you next to me There's no darkness I can't overcome
You are my raindrop I am the sea
With you and God,who's my sunlight I bloom and grow so beautifully
Baby, I'm so proud so proud to be your girl
You make the confusion Go all away
From this cold and messed up world

Called life without you here with me

I know it ain't easy Easy loving me
I appreciate the love and dedication
From you to me
Later on in my destiny I see myself having
Your child I see myself being your wife
And I see my whole future in your eyes
Thought of all my love for you sometimes make me wanna cry
Realize all my blessings
I'm grateful To have you by my side

My heart smiles
Every time it feels so good
It hurts sometimes

Feel, To breathe, To love you

I lose all control when you are here and baby, it amazes me
How could someone be so sexy and love like you do
Oh baby, do you understand the power that you posses over me
Can't accept this feeling and I don't think I want to
Got me going off all the love you give me

Yes we can be together but you gotta wait for me
The first time I say no, it's like I never said yes (it's like I never said yes)
I said yes we can be together, yes you can stay with me
But when I say no not tonight, you actin' so ungratefully
The first time I say no, it's like I never said yes (it's like I never said yes)
You was on the wall
I was with my crew
You was watchin' me baby
I was watchin' you
Slowly you walked over
I maintained my cool
You said hello to me, I
Said hello to you
You ask me where I'm from
I asked you what you do
You somehow intrigued me
I thought you were so cool
Somewhere between hi and goodbye
I felt so comfortable
I felt like we could talk all night
So I gave my number to you
I said yes to your number and yes to you dating me
Yes we can be together but you gotta wait for me
The first time I say no, it's like I never said yes (it's like I never said yes)
I said yes we can be together, yes you can stay with me
But when I say no not tonight, you actin' so ungratefully
The first time I say no, it's like I never said yes (it's like I never
Certainly you can call me baby
I love to hear from you
Yes of course you can come and see me boy
I wanna get to know you more, sure I'm feelin' you
No baby, not yet, we can't take that next step
Why you getting so upset, boy you
Act as though I never told you yes before
You are so ungrateful
You was at my house
I was sittin on my couch
You was really buggin' so I
Told you to get out
I had been misjudging you
You had a lotta nerve, you
Too damn old to be so immature, I hope you learn
You said I move too slow, I
I showed you to the door
You said you'd call me later
I said don't call no more
It is cool if you can't wait for me
I'm glad you let me know
'Cause you show me your true face baby
The first time I said no
I said yes to your number and yes to you dating me
Yes we can be together but you gotta wait for me
The first time I say no, it's like I never said yes (it's like I never said yes)
I said yes we can be together, yes you can stay with me
But when I say no not tonight, you actin' so ungratefully
The first time I say no, it's like I never said yes (it's like I never said yes before)

Body bangin\' up corset
Brothas wanna toss it
But they lost, cause my game made them forfeit
Slicker than a porpis and thicker than a horses
Carmen Brown got the whole town speechless
I\'ll stick to my thesis, I\'ll stick to my features
Brothas trying to hold, but thier game never reaches
Most of these cats are like the middle of peaches
I see you looking at, but what you looking at?
You in a bar, wanna twist me like a bottle cap
Mos Def - I\'m trying to holla Miss, to see if you gonna holla back
Beyonce\' - Your game is whack, and know you will not get your quarter back
See this is Carmen, curves like a cul-de-sac
skin coffee and cream, your donuts, you ain\'t dunkin that
Mos Def - But this is Miller, Lieutenant, if you\'re wondering
Sarpong - And I\'m the thag
Mos Def - Mel Gibson
Sarpong - Danny Gloverin\'
Beyonce\' - But I\'m not hearing you, you might as well be mumbling
See, I have dreams with a man, what will become of him?
There\'s not a kid out here who can make me believe
I should post pone my goals, he got tricks up his sleeve?
Whole bar full of cuffs and you ain\'t locking me down
Mos Def - I got a warrant for ya heart and a bedroom and trial
Sarpong - Get a pardon if you come with the Sergeant, now
Beyonce\' - Give me a chair, cause I don\'t care, I ain\'t feeling your style
Chorus
Mos Def - Yo, I\'m trying to get with you shorty
Beyonce\' - But I\'m not feeling you
Sarpong - But I\'m an officer shorty
Beyonce\' - My looks are killing you
Mos Def - Murder One will get you under the covers
Beyonce\' - Game taller, man slaughter, I ain\'t feeling you brothas
Mos Def - Yo, I\'m trying to get with you shorty
Beyonce\' - But I\'m not feeling you
Sarpong - But I\'m an officer shorty
Beyonce\' - My looks are killing you
Mos Def - Murder One will get you under the covers
Beyonce\' - Game taller, man slaughter, I ain\'t feeling you brothas
Eyes like the ocean
Mos Def - Ma, I got some lotion
Hold ya thighs, raise \'em high and daddy long stroke you
Beyonce\' - Hair like forever
Sarpong - Swear I could do it better
Take my gun out the holster, I still got the Barretta
Beyonce\' - Brothas sweat Carmen like Patrick Ewing, but that kid...
Mos Def - Don\'t waste your time, he ain\'t no doing, he\'s just a Sergeant
Passing out tickets for parking
Sarpong - Chickenheads clucking
Beyonce\' - Pitiful bulls barking
See this is Carmen, voice sweet as marvin
I turn out lights, with the switch, when I\'m walking
Girls getting jealous, cause they man always hawking
Even got Lou looking at me like he stalking
And I got a mind too
I wouldn\'t bless you,
if your first name was "Hachu" on Sunday singing gospel
Mos Def - You ain\'t a dime, just a nickel acting hostel
Beyonce\' - I\'m headed for the big time , I\'m bouncing on this side-show...'b"Do you think
You could fall for a woman like me
'Cause I find it hard to trust
I need too much
And I really don't believe in love, no, no
Do you think
That I could be the girl of your dreams
Sometimes I don't let things go
Get emotional
And sometimes I'm just out of control
You need to stop for a minute
Before you get too, deep up in it
(Too deep)
'Cause everything ain't what it seems
It's hard loving a woman
A woman like me
(Woman like me)
You need to think about it
Before you get hooked on the venom
And can't live without it
(No, no)
Can't believe everything you see
It's hard loving a woman
A woman like me
Do you think
That I could be the one that you seek
'Cause baby I'm one step ahead
You're two steps behind
But baby I don't mind
Do you think
That I can make you real happy baby
Just don't get me wrong
My loving is so strong
But I ain't tryna lead you on
You need to stop for a minute
(No, no)
Before you get too, deep up in it
(No, no)
'Cause everything ain't what it seems
(Seems)
It's hard loving a woman
A woman like me
(Woman like me)
You need to think about it
Before you get hooked on the venom
And can't live without it
(Without it)
Can't believe everything you see
It's hard loving a woman
A woman like me
Woman like me
Woman like me
Woman like me
Oh
You need to stop for a minute
(Stop for a minute)
Before you get too, deep up in it
(Before you get too deep up in it)
'Cause everything ain't what it seems
It's hard loving a woman
A woman like me
You need to think about it
(Think about it, baby)
Before you get hooked on the venom
And can't live without it
(No, no)
Can't believe everything you see
It's hard loving a woman
A woman like me
Woman like me
Woman like me
Woman like me"b"You're holding me and I close my eyes
You're whispering, and I start to cry
You feel so good, so beautiful
For as long as you live don't let me go
Just hold me, touch me, feel me
As long as you love me, reach for me and need me
If you could trust me, and teach me, never let go of me
Because you're half of me, my heart still beats
I'm looking in the eyes, the eyes of love
And I hold your face and I see the sun
I taste your kiss, you touch my soul
and I'm feeling things I've never felt before
Just hold me, touch me, feel me
As long as you love me, reach for me and need me
If you could trust me, and teach me, never let go of me
Because you're half of me my heart still beats
I'm feeling what they call pure love
I never knew feeling like this could exist inside of me
I'm soaring, emotions exploding
I don't want to live another day if you're not here with me
Just hold me, touch me, feel me
As long as you love me, reach for me and need me
If you could trust me, teach me, never let go of me
Because you're half of me my heart still beats
because you're half of me my heart still beats"b"It doesn't matter where you been

Beyonce: Let's go get 'em
Jay-Z: Uh huh, C'mon
Jay-Z:
I used to run base like Juan Pierre
Now I run the bass hi hat and the snare
I used to bag girls like Birkin Bags
Now I bag B (Beyonce: Boy you hurtin' that)
Brooklyn Bay where they birthed me at
Now I be everywhere the nerve of rap
The audacity to have me whippin curtains back
Me and B, she about to sting
Stand back
Beyonce:
Baby...
Seems like everywhere I go I see you
From your eyes, your smile it's like I breathe you
Helplessy I reminisce don't want to
Compare nobody to you
Boy I try to catch myself but I'm out of control
Your sexiness is so appealing I can't let it go!
You know that I can't get over you
'Cause everything I see is you
And I don't want no substitute
Baby I swear it's dej\xc3\x90\xc2\xb0 vu
You know that I can't get over you
'Cause everything I see is you
And I don't want no substitute
Baby I swear it's... dej\xc3\x90\xc2\xb0... vu
I'm seeing...
Things that I know can't be; am I dreaming?
When I saw you walking past me almost called your name
Got a better glimpse and then I looked away
Feels like I'm losing it
Boy I try to catch myself but I'm out of control
Your sexiness is so appealing I can't let it go!
You know that I can't get over you
'Cause everything I see is you
And I don't want no substitute
Baby I swear it's dej\xc3\x90\xc2\xb0 vu
You know that I can't get over you

Blow, wind
So Chicago of him
Is he the best ever? That's the argu-a-ment

I'm just one-to-one, nothin' after me
No dej\xc3\x90\xc2\xb0 vu, just me and my... oh!
Beyonce:
Baby I can't go anywhere
Without thinking that you're there
Seems like you're everywhere, it's true
Gotta be having dej\xc3\x90\xc2\xb0 vu

Get on the next plane, I don't care
Is it because I'm missing you,

Walking up to me like they know me
You were the one that stayed aside
Waited awhile and took your time
You dont know how impressing
Your curiosity was to me
It was the fourth day of July
Looked in my eyes and saw that I
I wanted more than just a man, I needed a friend
Someone I can talk to, someone who really listens
When you touched my hand, the sun got brighter then
Trusting you, I closed my eyes and felt our love begin
It was the summertime
When we fell in love it was the summertime
Heaven shined on us it was the summertime
Baby, there is nothing like the summertime, summertime
Now its been a year and were closer
Fall in love again when I hold ya
I know that God set you aside for me
And now you are my prize
Wanna grow old witcha
And fill our house with your pictures
Have a son for you, a little girl for me
Together well raise a family
Baby, youre more than just a man, you are my best friend
Someone I can talk to someone who really listens
When you touched my hand the sun got brighter then
Trusting you I closed my eyes and felt our love begin

Hold up, they don\'t love you like I love you
Slow down, they don\'t love you like I love you
Back up, they don\'t love you like I love you
Step down, they don\'t love you like I love you
Can\'t you see there\'s no other man above you?
What a wicked way to treat the girl that loves you
Hold up, they don\'t love you like I love you
Oh, down, they don\'t love you like I love you
[Verse 1]
Something don\'t feel right
Because it ain\'t right
Especially comin\' up after midnight
I smell your secret, and I\'m not too perfect
To ever feel this worthless
How did it come down to this?
Going through your call list
I don\'t wanna lose my pride, but I\'mma fuck me up a bitch
Know that I kept it sexy, and know I kept it fun
There\'s something that I\'m missing, maybe my head for one
[Refrain]
What\'s worse, lookin\' jealous or crazy?
Jealous or crazy?
Or like being walked all over lately, walked all over lately
I\'d rather be crazy

Hold up, they don\'t love you like I love you
Slow down, they don\'t love you like I love you
Back up, they don\'t love you like I love you
Step down, they don\'t love you like I love you
Can\'t you see there\'s no other man above you?
What a wicked way to treat the girl that loves you
Hold up, they don\'t love you like I love you
Slow down they don\'t love you like I love you
[Verse 2]
Let\'s imagine for a moment that you never made a name for yourself
Or mastered wealth, they had you labeled as a king
Never made it out the cage, still out there movin\' in them streets
Never had the baddest woman in the game up in your sheets
Would they be down to ride?
No, they used to hide from you, lie to you
But y\'all know we were made for each other
So I find you and hold you down
Me sing se
[Chorus]
Hold up, they don\'t love you like I love you
Slow down, they don\'t love you like I love you
Back up, they don\'t love you like I love you
Step down, they don\'t love you like I love you
Can\'t you see there\'s no other man above you?
What a wicked way to treat the girl that loves you
Hold up, they don\'t love you like I love you
Slow down they don\'t love you like I love you
[Bridge]
Oh it is such a shame
You let this good love go to waste
I always keep the top tier, 5 star
Backseat lovin\' in the car
Like make that wood, like make that wood
Holly like a boulevard
[Refrain]
What\'s worse, lookin\' jealous or crazy?
Jealous and crazy?
Or like being walked all over lately, walked all over lately
I\'d rather be crazy
[Chorus]
Hold up, they don\'t love you like I love you
Slow down, they don\'t love you like I love you
Back up, they don\'t love you like I love you
Step down, they don\'t love you like I love you
Can\'t you see there\'s no other man above you?
What a wicked way to treat the girl that loves you
Hold up, they don\'t love you like I love you
Oh, down, they don\'t love you like I love you

And we rode motorcycles

Tough girl is what I had to be
He said take care of your mother
Watch out for your sister
Oh, and that's when he gave to me...
With his gun, with his head held high
He told me not to cry
Oh, my daddy said shoot
Oh, my daddy said shoot
With his right hand on his rifle
He swore it on the bible
My daddy said shoot
Oh, my daddy said shoot
He held in his arms
And he taught me to be strong
He told me when he's gone
Here's what you do
When trouble comes to town
And men like me come around
Oh, my daddy said shoot
Oh, my daddy said shoot
Oh, oh, oh

It wasn't always right
But he said girl it's your second amendment, oh, oh, oh
He always played it cool
But daddy was no fool
And right before he died he said remember...
He said take care of your mother
Watch out for your sister
And that's when daddy looked at me...
With his gun, with his head held high
He told me not to cry
Oh, my daddy said shoot

He said baby girl he's playing you

Pictures snatched out the frame
Bitch, I scratched out your name and your face
What is it about you that I can't erase, baby?
When every promise don't work out that way, no no, babe
When every promise don't work out that way
And your heart is broken cause I walked away
Show me your scars and I won't walk away
And I know I promised that I couldn't stay, baby
Every promise don't work out that way, no no no no no
Every promise don't work out that way"b'Tryna rain, tryna rain on the thunder
Tell the storm I\'m new
I\'m a wall, come and march on the regular
Painting white flags blue
Lord forgive me, I\'ve been running
Running blind in truth
I\'ma rain, I\'ma rain on this bitter love
Tell the sweet I\'m new
I\'m telling these tears, "Go and fall away, fall away"
May the last one burn into flames
Freedom! Freedom! I can\'t move
Freedom, cut me loose!
Singin\', freedom! Freedom! Where are you?
Cause I need freedom too!
I break chains all by myself
Won\'t let my freedom rot in hell
Hey! I\'ma keep running
Cause a winner don\'t quit on themselves
I\'ma wade, I\'ma wave through the waters
Tell the tide, "Don\'t move"
I\'ma riot, I\'ma riot through your borders
Call me bulletproof
Lord forgive me, I\'ve been runnin\'
Runnin\' blind in truth
I\'ma wade, I\'ma wave through your shallow love
Tell the deep I\'m new
I\'m telling these tears, "Go and fall away, fall away"
May the last one burn into flames
Freedom! Freedom! I can\'t move
Freedom, cut me loose!
Singin\', freedom! Freedom! Where are you?
Cause I need freedom too!
I break chains all by myself
Won\'t let my freedom rot in hell
Hey! I\'ma keep running
Cause a winner don\'t quit on themselves
Ten Hail Mary\'s, I meditate for practice
Channel 9 news tell me I\'m moving backwards
Eight blocks left, death is around the corner
Seven misleading statements \'bout my persona
Six headlights waving in my direction
5-O asking me what\'s in my possession
Yeah, I keep running, jump in the aqueducts
Fire hydrants and hazardous
Smoke alarms on the back of us
But mama don\'t cry for me, ride for me
Try for me, live for me
Breathe for me, sing for me
Honestly guiding me
I could be more than I gotta be
Stole from me, lied to me, nation hypocrisy
Code on me, drive on me
Wicked, my spirit inspired me
Like yeah, open correctional gates in higher desert
Yeah, open our mind as we cast away oppression
Yeah, open the streets and watch our beliefs
And when they carve my name inside the concrete
I pray it forever reads
Freedom! Freedom! I can\'t move
Freedom, cut me loose!
Singing, freedom! Freedom! Where are you?
Cause I need freedom too!
I break chains all by myself
Won\'t let my freedom rot in hell
Hey! I\'ma keep running
Cause a winner don\'t quit on themselves
What you want from me?
Is it truth you seek? Oh father can you hear me?
What you want from me?
Is it truth you seek? Oh father can you hear me?
Hear me out
I had my ups and downs, but I always find the inner strength to cool myself off. I was served lemons, but I made lemonade'b"You can taste the dishonesty
It's all over your breath as you pass it off so cavalier
But even that's a test
Constantly aware of it all
My lonely ear
Pressed against the walls of your world
Prayin' to catch you whispering
I'm prayin' you catch me listening
I'm prayin' to catch you whispering
I'm prayin' you catch me
I'm prayin' to catch you whispering
I'm prayin' you catch me listening
I'm prayin' you catch me
Nothing else ever seems to hurt like the smile on your face
When it's only in my memory
It don't hit me quite the same
Maybe it's a cause for concern
But I'm not at ease
Keeping my head to the curb
Prayin' to catch you whispering
I'm prayin' you catch me listening
I'm prayin' to catch you whispering
I'm prayin' you catch me
I'm prayin' you catch me
I'm prayin' you catch me
I'm prayin' you catch me"b"[Chorus: Beyonc\xc3\x83\xc2\xa9]

But nine times outta ten, I know you're trying
So I'm trying to be fair
And you're trying to be there and to care
And you're caught up in your permanent emotions
All the loving I've been giving goes unnoticed
It's just floating in the air, lookie there
Are you aware you're my lifeline, are you tryna kill me
If I wasn't me, would you still feel me?
Like on my worst day? Or am I not thirsty, enough?
I don't care about the lights or the beams
Spend my life in the dark for the sake of you and me
Only way to go is up, skin thick, too tough
Cause you, you, you, you and me could move a mountain
You, you, you, you and me could calm a war down
You, you, you, you and me could make it rain now
You, you, you, you and me could stop this love drought
Nine times out of ten, I'm in my feelings
But ten times out of nine, I'm only human
Tell me, what did I do wrong?
Feel like that question has been posed
I'm movin' on
I'll always be committed, I been focused
I always paid attention, been devoted
Tell me, what did I do wrong?
Oh, already asked that, my bad
But you my lifeline, think you tryna kill me?
If I wasn't me, would you still feel me?
Like on my worst day? Or am I not thirsty, enough?
I don't care about the lights or the beams
Spend my life in the dark for the sake of you and me
Only way to go is up, them old bitches so wack
I'm so tough, wassup?
Cause you, you, you, you and me could move a mountain
You, you, you, you and me could calm a war down
You, you, you, you and me could make it rain now
You, you, you, you and me would stop this love drought"b"[Beyonce:]

Too bad you blew it
Too bad you couldn't put the work in
You gave up on us
When we should have worked it out

Than live my life without you

Than live my life without you

Than live my life without you

I'm giving you my life, it's in your hands
And what i'm gonna do
Is be a woman and you can be a man
And I wanna say
Nobody understands what we've been through

Than to live my life without you

Girls"b"I wanna leave my footprint on the sands of time
Know there was something that, meant something that I left behind
When I leave this world, I'll leave no regrets,
Leave something to remember, so they won't forget
I was here
I lived, I loved
I was here
I did, I've done, everything that I wanted
And it was more than I thought it would be
I will leave my mark so everyone will know
I was here
I want to say I lived each day, until I die
And know that I meant something in somebody's life
The hearts I have touched will be the proof that I leave
That I made a difference, and this world will see
I was here
I lived, I loved
I was here
I did, I've done, everything that I wanted
And it was more than I thought it would be
I will leave my mark so everyone will know
I was here
I lived, I loved
I was here
I did, I've done, everything that I wanted
And it was more than I thought it would be
I will leave my mark so everyone will know
I was here
I just want them to know
That I gave my all, did my best
Brought someone to happiness
Left this world a little better just because
I was here
I was here
I lived, I loved
I was here
I did, I've done, everything that I wanted
And it was more than I thought it would be
I will leave my mark so everyone will know
I was here.

Dedicated to the one of love, hey
Still love the way he talk, still love the way I sang
Still love the way he rock them black diamonds in that chain
Still all up on each other, ain't a damn thing change
My girls can't tell me nothing, I'm gone in the brain
I'm all up under him like it's cold, winter time
All up in the kitchen in my heels, dinner time
Do whatever that it takes, he got a winner's mind
Give it all to him, meet him at the finish line
Me and my boo in my boo coupe ridin'
All up in that black with his chick right beside him
Ladies, if you love your man show him you the fliest
Grind up on it, girl, show him how you ride it

But I still need you, why is that?
You're the only image in my mind
So I still see you, around
I miss you, like everyday
Wanna be with you, but you're away
Said I miss you, missing you insane
But if I got with you, could it feel the same
Words don't ever seem to come out right
But I still mean em, why is that?
It hurts my pride to tell you how I feel
But I still need to, why is that?
I miss you, like everyday
Wanna be with you, but you're away
I said I miss you, missing you insane
But if I got with you, could it feel the same
It don't matter who you are
It's so simple, a feeling
But it's everything no matter who you love
It is so simple, a feeling
But it's everything
I miss you, like everyday
Wanna be with you, but you're away
I said I miss you, missing you insane
But if I got with you, could it feel the same
It don't matter who you are
It's so simple, a feeling
But it's everything no matter who you love
It is so simple, a feeling

[Chorus:]
Ain't nothing out there for me

This is where I want to be
I dun already been in the streets
And I ain't came across nothin' so sweet
He's the only man that I love
And I don't need more than one
So don't worry when I'm hanging out
He's the only one that I am thinking about!
I know he's insecure
Every time I leave out the door
(and you letting him spoil your night? Live your life, you ain't even his wife)
He ain't gotta worry about me
Cause I got something more sweet
(Oh you must got a diamond ring)
And I know I'm so lucky
Ain't nothin'
[Chorus]
[Repeat: x2]
And I love him
He's my baby for sure

What goes around comes back around, hey, my, my baby
I say what goes around comes back around, hey, my baby
What goes around comes back around
There was a time I thought that you did everything right
No lies, no wrong
Boy, I must've been out of my mind
So when I think of the time that I almost loved you
You showed your ass and I, I saw the real you
Thank God you blew it
I thank God I dodged the bullet
I'm so over you
So, baby, good lookin' out
I won't let you back
I'm so through with that
'Cause honestly you turned out to be the (best thing I never had)
You turned out to be the (best thing I never had)
And I'm gonna always be the (best thing you never had)
Oh yeah, I bet it sucks to be you right now
So sad, you're hurt
Boohoo, oh, did you expect me to care?
You don't deserve my tears
I guess that's why they ain't there
When I think that there was a time that I almost loved you
You showed your ass and baby, yes, I saw the real you
Thank God you blew it
I thank God I dodged the bullet
I'm so over you
Baby, good lookin' out
I won't let you back
I'm so through with that
'Cause honestly you turned out to be the (best thing I never had)
I said, you turned out to be the (best thing I never had)
Mm, and I'll never be the (best thing you never had)
Oh, baby, I bet it sucks to be you right now
I know you want me back
It's time to face the facts
That I'm the one that's got away
Lord knows that it would take another place, another time Another world, another life
Thank God I found the good in goodbye
I used to want you so bad
I'm so through with that
'Cause honestly you turned out to be the (best thing I never had)
Oh, you turned out to be the (best thing I never had)
And I will always be the (best thing you never had)
Ooh, best thing you never had
I used to want you so bad
I'm so through with that

This is for them 40 somethings
Well raise up your glass and laugh like a muthaf#*%er

Hell, you're halfway there, baby take it to the head
Mom and dad, tried to hide the world
Said the world is just too big for a little girl
Eyes wide open, can't you see
I had my first heels by the age of 13
Mom and dad, tried to hide the boys
I swear that just make them want me more
At 14, they asked what I wanna be,
I said baby 21, so I get me a drink
I'm not a teacher, babe
But I can teach you something
Not a preacher
But we can pray if you wanna
Ain't a doctor

I'd worked for all my life
And I had to start again
With just my family by my side
I'd thank my lucky stars
To be living here today
'Cause the flag still stands for freedom
And they can't take that away
And I'm proud to be an American
Where at least I know I'm free
And I won't forget the men who died
Who gave that right to me
And I gladly stand up next to you
And defend her still today
'Cause there ain't no doubt I love this land
God bless the USA
From the lakes of Minnesota to the hills of Tennessee
Across the plains of Texas from sea to shining sea
From Detroit down to Houston to New York to L.A
Well there's pride in every American heart
And it's time to make a change
That I'm proud to be an American
Where at least I know I'm free
And I won't forget the men who died
And who gave that right to me
And I gladly stand up next to you
And defend her still today
'Cause there ain't no doubt I love this land
God bless the USA
And I'm proud to be an American
Where at least I know I'm free
And I won't forget the men who died
And who gave that right to me
And I gladly stand up next to you
And defend her still today
'Cause there ain't no doubt I love this land
God bless the USA"b"You are alone, and I'd be a piss
I got no one else to blame
You didn't know I was a risk
And it's such a crying shame
How you bet all of you and wanted nothing else for me
But come back sometimes for you but else I met you was only
I couldn't see but now I know that I acted selfishly
I should of known that I let you down and caused you so much misery
And never to plea, and never to plea, and never to plea, and never to plea
All of the times you used to cry
Because I would let you down
All of the times I should of tried a little more to be around
But I didn't know you were hurting I was just too blind
Only thing I know for certain another you I'll never find
I couldn't see but now I know that I acted selfishly
I should of known that I let you down and caused you so much misery
And never to plea, and never to plea, and never to plea, and never to plea."b"I feel weak, we've been here before,
'Cause I feel we keep going back and forth,
Maybe it's over, maybe we're through,
But I honestly can say I still love you,
Maybe we reached the mountain peak,
And there's no more left to climb,
And maybe we lost the magic piece,
And we're both too blind to find,
Let's start over,
Let's give love their wings,
Let's start over,
Stop fighting 'bout the same old thing,
Let's start over,
We can't let our good love die,
Maybe we can start over,
Give love another life,
I can see that we're not happy here,
So why would we keep pretending when there's nothing there?
Maybe you like it, well, I don't,
And maybe you'll settle, well, I won't,
Maybe we reached the mountain peak,
And there's no more left to climb,
And maybe we lost the magic piece,
And we're both too blind to find,
Let's start over,
Let's give love their wings,
Let's start over,
Stop fighting 'bout the same old thing,
Let's start over,
We can't let our good love die,
Maybe we can start over,
Give love another life,
I know that this will hurt you,
I know you'll cry,
I know I called you selfish, but that's a lie,
I feel I know that's the best for us,
Let's start over,
And let's give love their wings,
Let's start over,
I'm tired of fighting 'bout the same old thing,
Let's start over,
We both know that this love won't die,
Maybe we can start over,
And give love another life."b"Girls, we run this motha (yeah!) [x4]

None of these hoes can fade me

I'm repping for the girls who taking over the world
Have me raise a glass for the college grads
Anyone rolling I'll let you know what time it is
You can't hold me
I broke my 9 to 5 and copped my cheque
This goes out to all the women getting it in,
Get on your grind
To the other men that respect what I do
Please accept my shine
Boy you know you love it
How we're smart enough to make these millions
Strong enough to bare the children
Then get back to business
See, you better not play me
Don't come here baby
Hope you still like me
If you hate me!

I may be young but I'm ready
To give you all my love!
I told my girls you can get it,
Don't slow it down, just let it go
So in love I'll give it all away,
Just don't tell nobody tomorrow!
So tonight I'll do it every way,
Speakers knocking til the morning lights!

And the night belongs to us!
Just hold me close, don't let me go!
So in love! I don't care what they say!
I don't care if they're talking tomorrow!
Cause tonight is the night, oh, oh, oh

Ain't worried 'bout them fuck niggas over there,
But they worried 'bout me.

Fuck with me, baby!,
I'll make it milk til it drip down yo knees.
Spit that shit for real o, brain real o.
Kiddo says he looks up to me this just makes me feel old,
Never thought that we could become someone else's hero.
Man we were just in the food court eating guy gyros.
Yesterday that's the way,
Every single morning I try to pray!
Grandmama nem they never forgot, nothing else really means nothing to me.
I ain't stunting to be.
Talking to me?

[Verse 1: Beyonce]
And I've been drifting off on knowledge
Cat-calls on cat-walks, man these women getting solemn
I could sing a song for a Solomon or Salamander
We took a flight at midnight and now my mind
can't help but wander: how come?
Spoon-fed pluralized eyes to find the beaches in the forest
When I'm looking off the edge, I preach my gut it can't help but ignore it
I'm climbing up the walls cause all the shit I hear is boring
All the shit I do is boring, all these record labels boring
I don't trust these record labels, I'm touring
All these people on the planet
Working 9 to 5, just to stay alive
The 9 to 5, just to stay alive
The 9 to 5, just to stay alive
The 9 to 5, just to stay alive
The 9 to 5, just to stay alive
The 9 to 5, just to stay alive
The 9 to 5, just to stay alive
All the people on the planet
Working 9 to 5 just to stay alive
How come?
What goes up, goes around
Goes around around around around
What goes up, goes around
Goes around around around around

Part 2 - Haunted:
[Verse: 2]
It's what you do
It's what you see
I know if I'm haunting you
You must be haunting me
It's where we go
It's where we'll be
I know if I'm onto you, I'm onto you
Onto you, you must be onto me
My heart it lulls
Ghost in the sheets
I know if I'm haunting you
You must be haunting me
My wicked tongue
Where will it be
I know if I'm onto you
I'm onto you
Onto you, I'm onto you
Onto you, you must be onto me
You want me? I walk down the hallway
You're lucky, the bedroom's my runway
Slap me! I'm pinned to the doorway
Kiss, bite,fuck me
[Verse: 3]
My haunted lungs, ghost in the sheets
I know if I'm haunting you, you must be haunting me
My wicked tongue, where will it be?
I know if I'm onto you, you must be onto me

I know if I'm haunting you, you must be haunting me
It's where we go, it's where we'll be
I know if I'm onto you, I'm onto you
Onto you, I'm onto you
Onto you, you must be onto me
You must be onto me (onto you, I'm onto you)
You must be onto me (onto you, I'm onto you)
You must be onto me (onto you, I'm onto you)
You must be onto me (onto you, I'm onto you)
[Outro]
Me (onto you, I'm onto you)
Me (onto you, I'm onto you)
Me (onto you, I'm onto you)
Me (onto you, I'm onto you)
Me (onto you, I'm onto you)"b"[Verse 1: Beyonc\xc3\x83\xc2\xa9]
These four lonely walls have changed the way I feel
The way I feel, I'm standing still
And nothing else matters now, you're not here
So where are you? I've been callin' you, I'm missin' you
[Pre-Chorus: Beyonc\xc3\x83\xc2\xa9]
Where else can I go? Where else can I go?
Chasin' you, chasin' you
Memories turn to dust, please don't bury us
I got you, I got you
[Chorus: Beyonc\xc3\x83\xc2\xa9]
Runnin', runnin', runnin', runnin'
Runnin', runnin', runnin'
Ain't runnin' from myself no more
Together we'll win it all
I ain't runnin', runnin', runnin', runnin'
Runnin', runnin', runnin'
Ain't runnin' from myself no more
I'm ready to face it all
If I lose myself, I lose it all
[Verse 2: Arrow Benjamin]
I've outrun the fears that chased, they're standin' still
I'm runnin' still, I'm runnin' still
And every voice that cried inside my head, forever drives
Forever drives, I kill the lights
[Pre-Chorus: Arrow Benjamin]
Where else can I go? Where else can I go?
Chasing you, chasing you
[Chorus: Arrow Benjamin + Beyonc\xc3\x83\xc2\xa9]
Runnin', runnin', runnin', runnin'
Runnin', runnin', runnin'
Ain't runnin' from myself no more
Together we'll win it all
I ain't runnin', runnin', runnin', runnin'
Runnin', runnin', runnin'
Ain't runnin' from myself no more
I'm ready to face it all
If I lose myself, I lose it all
If I lose myself, I lose it all
If I lose myself, I lose it all
If I lose myself, I lose it all"b"Verse 1-
I always loved you, even though did me wrong
I always stayed by your side, I guess I was your fool
I always cared, there's no one above you
I swear, cheated on me now she's there
Pre-Chorus-
She won't answer your calls, don't wanna be bothered at all
I guess I'll be the one standing with open arms
Sucka for love, kisses too
Ya touch, I'm crazy for you
Chorus-
I'll settle for you, yes I will be the one who will
Settle for you, yes I will be the one you run to
You come running to, yes I will be the one who will
Settle for you, settle for you
Verse 2-
I can never leave you, no matter how hard I try
You'll probably do it again, I'll still be right here waiting
Nothing has changed, it remains, the same, I can't explain
Pre-Chorus
Sucka for love, ya kisses too
Ya touch, I'm crazy for you
Chorus-1x
Bridge-
Even when the chips are down, I'll still settle for you
You'll probably hurt me again, I'll still settle for you
I know I must be the world's greatest fool
(repeat)
I'll still settle for you
Chorus- 1x
Ad-libs-
I will always love you no matter how hard I try
Probably do it again I'll still be here waiting
Stuck with you, in love with you, here for you, loving you
Settling for you baby yea"b'Si yo fuera un chico

you feel good feeling low
I like my colours vivid
and you paint your colours gold
I like to see the world and you like your weekends home
but I\'ve been tagging behind while you refused to go
Chorus:
\'Cause you\'re such a burden
but you\'re the weight off of my shoulders
\'Cause even though I\'m hurting
it still feels like it\'s time I\'m growing
When I thought that we\'d grow up and grow together the same time
guess I passed you by at that old "Stop" sign
At that old "Stop" sign
You like to sleep all day and I like my minutes long
I like trips to the movies you watch TV all night long
I like to go out dancing and you go out just to hang
And I\'ve been right beside you losing me and doing the same
Chorus:
\'Cause you\'re such a burden
but you\'re the weight off my shoulders
\'Cause even though I\'m hurting
it still feels like it\'s time I\'m growing
When I thought that we\'d grow up and grow together the same time
guess I passed you by at that old "Stop" sign
At that old "Stop" sign
I looked around and baby you were gone
Where did I lost you honey
I even slowed down thought you\'d follow
But you took your own roads honey
\'Cause I\'ve been travelling travelling travelling
only to find that I\'m making this trip alone
And I\'ve been staying behind while you refused to go
Chorus:
\'Cause you\'re such a burden
but you\'re the weight off my shoulders
\'Cause even though I\'m hurting
it still feels like it\'s time I\'m growing
When I thought that we\'d grow up and grow together the same time

At that old "Stop" sign'b"Hehehe Yeah b,

(Uh HOV, Uh, HOV, uh huh huh!)
I B the d-boy who infiltrated all the corporate dudes
They call shots, I call audibles
Jacob the jeweler, baubles, Lorraine Schwartz sorta dude
It's big balling baby when I'm courting you
I'm talking spy bags and fly pads and rooms at the Bloomberg
And rumors you on the verge of a new merge
'Cause that rock on ya finger is like a tumor
You can't fit ya hand in ya new purse
It's humorous to me they watching
and we just yachting off the island hopping off
Amalfi coast
Mafioso, oh baby you ever seen Saturn
No, not the car but everywhere we are
You sure to see stars.
This is high level not eye level,
My bezzle courtesy of Audemars
I order yours tomorrow now look at the time I saved you
Mama let me upgrade you

Just when you think we had it all
Big ends, condos, collecting cars
Picture your life elevating with me

I keep your name hot in them streets
That little glimpse of light
Makes that diamond really shine
And you already is a star
Unless your flawless
Then ya dynasty ain't complete without a chief like me

with hopes that maybe I'll get a chance to see you
When I close my eyes
I'm goin outta my head
Lost in a fairytale
Can you hold my hands and be my guide
Clouds filled with stars cover your skies
and I hope it rains
You're the perfect lullaby
What kinda dream is this?
You can be a sweet dream or a beautiful nightmare
Either way I don't wanna wake up from you
Sweet dream or a beautiful nightmare
Somebody pinch me, your love's too good to be true
My guilty pleasure I ain't goin no where
Baby long as you're here
I'll be floatin on air cause you're my
You can be a sweet dream or a beautiful nightmare
Either way I, don't wanna wake up from you
I mention you when I say my prayers
I wrap you around all of my thoughts
Boy you my temporary high
I wish that when I wake up youre there
So wrap your arms around me for real
and tell me you'll stay by side
Clouds filled with stars cover the skies
and I hope it rains
You're the perfect lullaby
What kinda dream is this?
You can be a sweet dream or a beautiful nightmare
Either way I, don't wanna wake up from you
Sweet dream or a beautiful nightmare
Somebody pinch me, your love's too good to be true
My guilty pleasure I ain't goin no where
Baby long as you're here
I'll be floatin on air cause you're my
You can be a sweet dream or a beautiful nightmare
Either way I, don't wanna wake up from you
Tattoo your name across my heart
So it will remain
Not even death could make us part
What kind of dream is this?
You can be a sweet dream or a beautiful nightmare
Either way I, don't wanna wake up from you
Sweet dream or a beautiful nightmare
Somebody pinch me, your love's too good to be true
You can be a sweet dream or a beautiful nightmare"b"Oh, You're everything I thought you never were
And nothing like I thought you could've been
But still you live inside of me
So tell me how is that
You're the only one I wish I could forget
The only one I love to not forgive
And though you break my heart
You're the only one
And though there are times when I hate you 'cause I can't erase
The times that you hurt me and put tears on my face
And even now while I hate you it pains me to say
I know I'll be there at the end of the day
I don't wanna be without you babe
I don't wanna a broken heart
Don't wanna take a breath without you babe
I don't wanna to play that part
I know that I love you but let me just say
I don't wanna love you in no kinda way
No, no, I don't wanna a broken heart
And I don't wanna to play the broken-hearted girl
No, no, no broken-hearted girl
I'm no broken-hearted girl
Something that I feel I need to say
But up 'til now I've always been afraid
That you would never come around
And still I wanna put this out
You say you got the most respect for me
But sometimes I feel you're not deserving of me
And still you're in my heart
But you're the only one
And yes there are times when I hate you but I don't complain
'Cause I've been afraid that you would walk away
Oh, but now I don't hate you, I'm happy to say
That I will be there at the end of the day
I don't wanna be without you babe
I don't wanna a broken heart
Don't wanna take a breath without you baby
I don't wanna to play that part
I know that I love you but let me just say
I don't wanna love you in no kinda way
No, no, I don't wanna a broken heart
And I don't wanna to play the broken-hearted girl
No, no, no broken-hearted girl
Now I'm at a place I thought I'd never be, ooh
I'm living in a world that's all about you and me, yeah
Ain't gotta be afraid, my broken heart is free
To spread my wings and fly away, away with you
Yeah, yeah, yeah, oh, oh
I don't wanna be without my baby
I don't wanna broken heart
Don't wanna take a breath without my baby
I don't wanna to play that part
I know that I love you but let me just say
I don't wanna love you in no kinda way
No, no, I don't wanna a broken heart
I don't wanna to play the broken-hearted girl
No, no, no broken-hearted girl, broken-hearted girl
No, no, no broken-hearted girl, no broken-hearted girl"b"Satellites flashing by
It's a beautiful state we're in
But how can we love in isolation?
Think how happy we can be when we just try
When nothing like we seem
Passionate words are never spoken
You don't know how I bleed
When I leave your side
In your eyes, love's alive
You've come untied
'Cause we're flashing by
Like satellites, satellites
Take all the rules away
How can we live if we don't change?
We're always on display
Let's run and hide
In our eyes, love's alive
We've come untied
'Cause we're flashing by
Like satellites, satellites
If we don't communicate
We'll exist in our own space
We have all the love we need
While we're apart I cannot breathe
Satellites flashing by
Satellites"b"If I were a boy even just for a day
I'd roll out of bed in the morning
And throw on what I wanted
And go drink beer with the guys
And chase after girls
I'd kick it with who I wanted
And I'd never get confronted for it
'Cause they stick up for me
If I were a boy
I think I could understand
How it feels to love a girl
I swear I'd be a better man
I'd listen to her
'Cause I know how it hurts
When you lose the one you wanted
'Cause he's taking you for granted
And everything you had got destroyed
If I were a boy
I would turn off my phone
Tell everyone it's broken
So they'd think that I was sleeping alone
I'd put myself first
And make the rules as I go
'Cause I know that she'd be faithful
Waiting for me to come home, to come home
If I were a boy
I think I could understand
How it feels to love a girl
I swear I'd be a better man
I'd listen to her
'Cause I know how it hurts
When you lose the one you wanted
'Cause he's taking you for granted
And everything you had got destroyed
It's a little too late for you to come back
Say it's just a mistake
Think I'd forgive you like that
If you thought I would wait for you
You thought wrong
But you're just a boy
You don't understand
And you don't understand, oh
How it feels to love a girl
Someday you wish you were a better man
You don't listen to her
You don't care how it hurts
Until you lose the one you wanted
'Cause you're taking her for granted
And everything you had got destroyed
But you're just a boy"b'Oh oh oh I, oh oh oh I
If I wrote a book about where we stand
The title of my book would be "Life with Superman"
That\'s how you make me feel

I did this
I got no one else to blame
You didn't know
I was a risk
And it's such a crying shame
How you gave me all of you and wanted nothing else from me
But to make sometime for you but all i made you was lonely

I couldn't see
But now I know
That I acted selfishly
I should've known
That I let you down
And caused you so much misery
Forever to bleed
Forever to bleed
Forever to bleed
Forever to bleed
I should've been there
I should've been there
I should've been there
I should've been there
All of the times
You used to cry
Because i would let you down
I'm losin time
I should've tried
A little more to be around
But I didn't know that you were hurting, I was just too blind
Only thing I know for certain: another you I'll never find

That I acted selfishly

I should've been there
I should've been there
I should've been there
I'm filled with regret
I'm gonna tip and soak myself in misery
Now in your life
I'll take my time
No more yearning without me
But it hurts to think of you all by yourself but now I see
And I apologize for all the times I left you home waiting for me

But to make some time for you
But all I made you was lonely
I couldn't see but now I know
That I acted selfishly
I should've known that I let you down
Caused you so much misery
Forever to bleed, Forever to bleed
Forever to bleed, Forever to bleed
I should've been there, I should've been there
I should've been there, I should've been there
All of the times you used to cry
Because I would let you down
I'm losing time, I should've tried
A little more to be around
But I didn't know you that were hurting
I was just too blind
Only thing I know for certain
Another you I'll never find
I couldn't see but now I know
That I acted selfishly
I should've known that I let you down
Caused you so much misery
Forever to bleed, Forever to bleed
Forever to bleed, Forever to bleed
I should've been there (ooO0Oo), I should've been there (ooO0Oo)
I should've been there (ooO0Oo), I should've been there (ooO0Oo)
I'm filled with regret, I'm gonna tip
And sew/soak myself in misery
Now in your life I'll take more time
No more yearning without me
But it hurts to think of you
All by yourself and now I see
And I apologize for all the times
I left you home waiting for me
I couldn't see but now I know
That I acted selfishly
I should've known that I let you down
Caused you so much misery
Forever to bleed, Forever to bleed
Forever to bleed, Forever to bleed

Alright again, alright again
The heart is stronger than you think
Like it could go through anything
And even when you think it cant
It finds a way to still push on though
Sometimes you wanna run away
Ain't got the patience for the pain
And if you don't believe it look into your heart
The beat goes on
I'm tellin' you things get better through whatever
If you fall, dust it off, don't let up
Don't you know you can go be your own miracle
You need to know!
If the mind keeps thinking you've had enough
But the heart keeps telling you'don't give up'
Who are we to be questioning, wondering what is what?
Don't give up, through it all, just stand up
Ooh, its like we all had better days
Problems getting all up in your face
Just because you go through it
Don't mean it gotta take control, no
You ain't gotta find no hiding place
Because the heart can beat the hate
Don't wanna let the mind keep playing you
Saying you cant go on
Im' tellin' you things get better through whatever
If you fall, dust if off, don't let up
Don't you know you can go be your own miracle
You need to know!
If the mind keeps thinking youve had enough
But the heart keeps telling you 'dont give up'
Who are we to be questioning, wondering what is what?
Dont give up, through it all, just stand up
Through it all, just stand up
You dont gotta be a prisoner in your mind
If you fall, dust it off, you can live your life
Yeah, let your heart be your guide
Yeah yeah yeah
You will know there's a good if you trust the good
Everything will be alright, yeah
Light up the dark, if you follow your heart
And it will get better through whatever
If the mind keeps thinking youve had enough
But the heart keeps telling you 'dont give up'
Who are we to be questioning, wondering what is what?
Dont give up, through it all, just stand up
If the mind keeps thinking youve had enough
But the heart keeps telling you 'dont give up'
Who are we to be questioning, wondering what is what?
Dont give up, through it all, just stand up

I thought it was so sweet
In the beginning
But now you're too clingy for me
You don't put the seat down
You don't clean the house how
I like it (trifling)
That's reason enough, your time's expired

If I ain't gotta ring by now that means I'm not tied down (I gotta switch him out switch him out switch him out switch him out) Kick him out kick him out kick him out kick him out

Well Baby they're tumbling down
And they didn't even put up a fight
They didn't even make a sound
I found a way to let you in
But I never really had a doubt
Standing in the light of your halo (oh oh)
I've got my angel now
It's like I've been awakened
Every rule I had you breaking
It's the risk that I'm taking

eyes shut, I find myself in love racing the earth
And I'm soaked in your love
And love was right in my path, in my grasp
And me and you belong
I wanna run, run, smash into you
I wanna run, run, smash into you
Ears closed, what I hear no one else has to know

If I were a boy even just for a day
I'd roll out of bed in the morning
And throw on what I wanted and go
Drink beer with the guys
And chase after girls
I'd kick it with who I wanted
And I'd never get confronted for it
'Cause they stick up for me
{Chorus}
If I were a boy
I think I could understand
How it feels to love a girl
I swear I'd be a better man
I'd listen to her
'Cause I know how it hurts
When you lose the one you wanted
'Cause he's taking you for granted
And everything you had got destroyed
{Verse}
If I were a boy
I would turn off my phone
Tell everyone it's broken
So they'd think that I was sleeping alone
I'd put myself first
And make the rules as I go
'Cause I know that she'd be faithful
Waiting for me to come home
To come home...

If I were a boy
I think I could understand
How it feels to love a girl

It's a little too late for you to come back
Say it's just a mistake
Think I'd forgive you like that
If you thought I would wait for you
You thought wrong

But you're just a boy
You don't understand
Yeah you don't understand, oh
How it feels to love a girl
Someday you wish you were a better man
You don't listen to her
You don't care how it hurts
Until you lose the one you wanted
Cause you're taking her for granted
And everything you had got destroyed

Nothing else from me
But to make
Some time for you
But all I made you

That I acted
Selfishly

Cat got your tongue
Don't look so funny
Mister comedian
Joke's on you
And you're good at bets
So where's my money
I know you bet
I'd never make that move
So why's the house empty?
Light's off by the end of this week
I'll leave with what I came with baby
I'll take the dogs, you keep the mercedes
Cause I'm gone, I'm not fazed
I walk these roads with grace
And I'll wave with you behind me
With a new smile on my face
Cause I'm walking in new shoes now
I got a new song to sing
When I walk in the room every head turns
Every eye is on me
To bad you're not here to see it
And by the time you get this
I'll be so long gone and far
I'll send you a postcard
Aha I'll send you a postcard

You seen a ghost? this ain't yo lady
This is the chick that you held back now
All of the things you've said were crazy

Took that job you said I could not get
Wore that dress you said I'd never fit in"b'I think that we should break up

Will it give me some light?
Should I wait for you to call? Is there any hope at all?
Are you drifting by?
When I think about it I know that I was never there or even cared
The more I think about it the less that I was able to share with you
I try to reach for you, I can almost feel you
You're nearly here and then
You disappear
(Disappear, disappear, disappear)
You disappear
(Disappear, disappear, disappear)
And then I lie all by myself, I see your face, I hear your voice
My heart stays faithful
And time has come and time has passed, if it's good, it's got to last
It feels so right
When I think about it I know that I was never there or even cared
The more I think about it the less that I was able to share with you
I try to reach for you, I can almost feel you
You're nearly here and then
You disappear

You disappear
(Disappear, disappear, disappear)
You, you disappear

You disappear
I missed all the signs one at a time
You were ready
What did I know starting our lives
No, my love I'm ready to show
When I think about it I know that I was never there or even cared
The more I think about it the less that I was able to share with you
I try to reach for you, I can almost feel you

Sometimes I don't let things go, get emotional, and sometimes i'm just outta control.
You need to stop for a minute.

Can't believe everything you see.
It's hard lovin a woman, a woman like me.
Do you think that I could be the one that you see?

Your two steps behind, but baby I don't mind
Do you think that I could make you real happy, baby?

I can't believe I believed everything we had would last
So young and naive for me to think she was from your past
Silly of me to dream of one day having your kids
Love is so blind it feels right when it's wrong
I can't believe I fell for your schemes--I'm smarter than that
So dumb and naive to believe that with me you're a changed man
Foolish of me to compete when you cheat with loose women
It took me some time, but now I've moved on
Because I realized I've got

Me, myself, and I--that's all I got in the end
That's what I found out
And it ain't no need to cry; I took a vow that from now on
I'm gon' my own best friend
Me, myself, and I--that's all I got in the end
That's what I found out
And it ain't no need to cry; I took a vow that from now
I'm gon' my own best friend
You're so controlling; you say that you love me, but you don't
Your family told me one day I would see it on my own
Next thing I know I'm dealing with your three kids in my home
Love is so blind it feels right when it's wrong
Now that it's over stop calling me; come pick up yo' clothes
Ain't no need to front like ya still with me--all your homies know
Even your very best friend tried to warn me on the low
Took me some time, but now I am strong
Because I realized I've got

I know that I will never disappoint myself

Yeah, you hurt me, but I learned a lot along the way

My lonely days are over
And life is like a song
Oh yeah
At last the skies above are blue
My heart was wrapped up in clover
The night I looked at you
I found a dream that I could speak to
A dream that I can call my own
I found a dream to press my cheek to
A thrill that I have never known
Oh yeah, you smile, you smile
Oh, and then the spell was cast
And here we are in heaven
For you are mine at last'b"I'm a, a diva, hey

And show me secrets, you didn't know was inside
No need for me to lie
It's too big, it's too wide
It's too strong, it won't fit
It's too much, it's too tough
He talk like this 'cause he can back it up
He got a big ego, such a huge ego
I love his big ego, it's too much
He walk like this 'cause he can back it up
Usually I'm humble, right now I don't choose
You can leave with me or you could have the blues
Some call it arrogant, I call it confident
You decide when you find on what I'm working with
Damn I know I'm killing you with them legs
Better yet them thighs
Matter a fact it's my smile or maybe my eyes
Boy you a sight to see, kind of something like me
It's too big, it's too wide
It's too strong, it won't fit
It's too much, it's too tough
I talk like this 'cause I can back it up
I got a big ego, such a huge ego
But he love my big ego, it's too much
I walk like this 'cause I can back it up
I, I walk like this 'cause I can back it up
I, I talk like this 'cause I can back it up
I, I can back it up, I can back it up
I walk like this 'cause I can back it up
It's too big, it's too wide
It's too strong, it won't fit
It's too much, it's too tough
He talk like this 'cause he can back it up
He got a big ego, such a huge ego, such a huge ego
I love his big ego, it's too much
He walk like this 'cause he can back it up
Ego so big, you must admit
I got every reason to feel like I'm that bitch
Ego so strong, if you ain't know
I don't need no beat, I can sing it with piano"b"She was lost in so many different ways
Out in the darkness with no guide
I know the cost of a losing hand
Never thought the grace of God, go High
I found heaven on earth
You were my last, my first
And then I hear this voice inside
Ave Maria
I've been alone when I'm surrounded by friends
How could the silence be so loud?
But I still go home knowing that I've got you
There's only us when the lights go down
You are my heaven on earth
You are my hunger, my thirst
I always hear this voice inside
saying Ave Maria
Sometimes love can come and pass you by
While you're busy making plans
Suddenly hits you and then you realize
It's out of your hands, baby you got to understand
You are my heaven on earth
You are my last, my first
And then I hear this voice inside
Ave Maria, Ave Maria, Ave Maria"b"I love to love you, baby

I'm trying to beat this emptiness but I'm running out of time
I'm sinking in the sand and I can't barely stand
I'm lost in this dream, I need you to hold me
I'm scared of lonely
I try to be patient but I'm hurting deep inside
And I can't keep waiting, I need comfort late at night
And I can't find my way, won't you lead me home?
'Cause I'm lost in this dream, I need you to hold me
I'm scared of lonely
And I'm scared of being the only shadow I see along a wall
And I'm scared of the only heart beat I hear beating is my own
And I'm scared of being alone, I can't seem to breathe
When I am lost in this dream, I need you to hold me
I'm scared of lonely, I'm scared of lonely
I cry at night 'cause my baby's too far to be by my side
To wipe away these tears of mine so I hold my pillow tight
To imagine you I'll stretch your hand looking for mine
'Cause I'm lost in this dream, I need you to hold me
I'm scared of lonely
And I'm scared of being the only shadow I see along a wall
And I'm scared of the only heart beat I hear beating is my own
I'm scared of being alone, I can't seem to breathe
When I am lost in this dream, I need you to hold me
I need your strength when nobody is around
'Cause I'm tired of this emptiness
I think I'm drowning, I can't be lonely no more
And I'm lost in this dream, I need you to hold me
I'm scared of lonely
And I'm scared of being the only shadow I see along a wall
And I'm scared of the only heart beat I hear beating is my own
And I'm scared of being alone, I can't seem to breathe
When I am lost in this dream, I need you to hold me
I'm scared of lonely
And I'm scared of be the only shadow I see along a wall
And I'm scared of the only heart beat I hear beating is my own
And I'm scared of being alone, I can't seem to breathe
When I am lost in this dream, I need you to hold me
I'm scared of lonely, I'm scared of lonely"b"Beyonce: Halo

Now put your hands up
Up in the club, we just broke up, I'm doing my own little thing
Decided to dip and now you wanna trip
'Cause another brother noticed me
I'm up on him, he up on me
Don't pay him any attention
Just cried my tears, for three good years
Ya can't be mad at me
'Cause if you liked it, then you should have put a ring on it
If you liked it, then you shoulda put a ring on it
Don't be mad once you see that he want it

Got me tighter in my Dereon jeans
Acting up, drink in my cup

Don't pay him any attention

What it really feels like to miss me

I'm not that kind of girl
Your love is what I prefer, what I deserve
Here's a man that makes me, then takes me
And delivers me to a destiny, to infinity and beyond

Look young 'cause they got soul
That's why they're beautiful
And my heart used to be cold
Till your hands laid on my soul
Baby, that's why you're beautiful
I'm not wondering why the sky's blue
That's not my business
All I know is I look up and tell myself
Be patient, love that could be us
Lovers used to make love
And die just to give us
Their piece of the beautiful
Remember when we made love?
Love, wasn't it beautiful?
Don't ask me why the sky's blue
That's not my business
All I know is I look up and tell myself
Be patient, love that could be us
Diamonds used to be coal
Look young cause they got soul
And my heart used to be cold
Till your hands laid on my soul
Somebody's got to stay deep in love
That could be us, that's why we're beautiful

Ooh, why? Why?

I know it ain't easy Easy loving me
I appreciate the love and dedication
From you to me

Your child I see myself being your wife

Thought of all my love for you sometimes make me wanna cry
Realize all my blessings

una make me tun\' up the temperature, tun\' up the temperature
Tun\' up the temperature pon you non-stop
[Pre-Chorus] + [Chorus]'b'Mama, I understand your many sleepless nights
When you sit and you think about Father
Or how you tried to be the perfect wife
You used to dress and fix your hair
Then you smiled through your tears
In the mirror you would stare
And say a prayer
Like "I wish he said I\'m beautiful
I wish it didn\'t hurt at all
I don\'t know how I got here
I was once the one who had his heart"
Until you had enough then you took that ring off
You took that ring off
So tired of the lies and trying, fighting, crying
Took that ring off
Oh, now the fun begins
Dust yourself off and you love again
You found a new man now you shine and you\'re fine
Like it\'s my time, you took that ring off
Mama (so sexy), you live and learn, that\'s just the way life goes
(Uh, you a killer, you a killer, killer)
Always know that you\'ve got a daughter
That\'s so, so proud you took the high road
(You a killer, so sexy)
You used to dress and fix your hair
Then you smiled through your tears
In the mirror you would stare
And say a prayer
Like "I wish he said I\'m beautiful
I wish it didn\'t hurt at all
I don\'t know how I got here
I was once the one who had his heart"
Until you had enough then you took that ring off
You took that ring off
So tired of the lies and trying, fighting, crying
Took that ring off
Oh, now the fun begins
Dust yourself off and you love again
You found a new man now you shine and you\'re fine
Like it\'s my time, you took that ring off
After all your tears
After all that pain\'s all clear
Mama, after all them years
We can start all over again
Mama, and now it all makes sense
Letting go is never the end
Mama, we can love again
This is where freedom begins
Mama, so put your love on top
You gon\' shine and put your love on top
It\'s your time to put your love on top
Everybody put your love on top
Aye, love on top
Aye, love on top
It\'s your time to put your love on top
Girl you so fine, put your love on top
If you\'re going through it just know it\'s called "going through it"
You\'re not gonna get stuck there, you\'re not gonna die
You\'re gonna survive'b'[Intro: Beyonc\xc3\x83\xc2\xa9]

Wish I was your baby momma
Want me to come around and give you good karma, but no

I can hear you calling
Calling up my name..
Sailing on
To see how far I've come"b"Today I come home to an empty house
Everything's here but you're gone
I opened up the doors to an empty room
And there was nothing standing in the place of where used to be you
I say
I really fucked up girl but i need you now"b"There's not a soul inside
How did I ever get here
I'm missing life before wish you would re-appear
But I fell so hard, I went beneath the surface
You see a lovely dance, slowing disappearing
Is it a sweet dream or is it a nightmare
I can't sleep without you right here
Lost in the middle of nowhere
I need you now
Feels like I'm on a lonely island
Waiting for ya
Waiting for ya
On this lonely island
Waiting for ya
Waiting for ya
Save me from this lonely island
Save me from this lonely island
Searching high and low
Took my mind to another planet
Didn't love this love could cause me so much damage
But the thought of you keeps me heart from wondering
Are these lovely sands slowly re-appearing
Is it a sweet dream or is it a nightmare
I can't sleep without you right here
Lost in the middle of nowhere
I need you now
Feels like I'm on a lonely island
Waiting for ya
Waiting for ya
On this lonely island
Waiting for ya
Waiting for ya
Feels like I'm on a lonely island
Waiting for ya
Waiting for ya
On this lonely island
Waiting for ya
Waiting for ya"b"Baby I'm on my way,

And how come some things never change?
Why do I always seem to find the same girl?
Why do I do it? How do I do it?
I guess my karma just ain't right
Cause when it comes to love I try,
But I can't seem to get it right, lately, baby
CHORUS:
I started writing you a love song
But baby now the love's gone
So I just wanna close my eyes
And watch it all disappear (disappear)
so this is not a love song (this is not a love song)
Cause baby now the love is gone
I just wanna close my eyes
And watch it all disappear (disappear)
Somebody hold me down
Somebody hold me now
Somebody hold me down
Somebody hold me now, now, now
I used to be the type of guy
To find the girl and keep the girl
But these days I find the girl
And can't wait to leave her
I walk around in another town
Like I must be her first {?}
Just don't make sense, no
And it's a shame you just might bid one girl on all my dreams
And right now I'd do anything to get you back home, my dear
And sorry isn't good enough for you, it seems
I got her
CHORUS:
I started writing you a love song
But baby now the love's gone
So I just wanna close my eyes
And watch it all disappear (disappear)
so this is not a love song (this is not a love song)
Cause baby now the love is gone
I just wanna close my eyes
And watch it all disappear (disappear)
Somebody hold me down
Somebody hold me now
Somebody hold me down
Somebody hold me now, now, now

(how you pronounce it)
You know I loved getting up in the morning,
When the sun first strikes the tree
All the morning birds are singing above,
It stll brings back memories of a girl who stood beside me,
When the rights I did were wrong
But she went back down the river,
Just when I thought I could be strong,
When I thought I could be strong, So I say
[Chorus]
She never told me why she left me, but the letter said goodbye
Now my mornings are for wondering, and my nights to reason why,
Why a stranger comes to steal the love, of a girl I had to own
But she went back down the river, just when I thought I could be strong,
Hen I thought I could be strong, so I say
[Chorus: Repeats]'b"I'm so tired of playing these games
What you say is never the same
One day you're lovin' me
The next day you're gone
How should I handel this
You stole my heart with just one kiss
Now you're ignorin' me
And you're doing me wrong
Everytime you shut me out it's harder to take
I gotta stop this now before my heart starts to break
You think what you're telling me is oh so true
But sometimes I still think I'm the man for you
Go Away, that's not what you said yesterday
Please leave, don't stay
Why are you telling me these words today
We tried to talk last night
But it ended up in a fight
You left me so confused
?Cause I thought things were cool
I thought I was the one for you
But there's something else your going through
So tell me what you wanna do
Before we move on
Everytime you shut me out it's harder to take
I gotta stop this now before my heart starts to break
You think what you're telling me is oh so true
But sometimes I still think I'm the man for you
Go Away, that's not what you said yesterday
Please leave, don't stay
Why are you telling me these words today"b"See you can't remember what I can't forget
All the things we had together
Keep your picture baby, to remind me of
When you said we'd be forever
I don't care who's wrong or right
Can we give it one more try
I just need you here tonight
We're like fire, water, sun and the rain
When we touch each other it's pleasure and pain
If there's something missing, there's something to gain
That's what love's all about, baby don't take
The easy way out
Tell me what you're missing
Where it all went wrong
Let's go back to where we started
Back to where we started girl
Give me one good reason why we shouldn't try
Don't wanna leave this broken heart
I don't care who's wrong or right
Can we give it one more try
I just need you here tonight
We're like fire, water, sun and the rain
When we touch each other it's pleasure and pain
If there's something missing, there's something to gain
That's what love's all about, baby don't take
The easy way out
When I try to get close, you push me away
As if you'd rather be taken the easy way out
I can live through the pain, but I can't live without you
We're like fire, water, sun and the rain
When we touch each other it's pleasure and pain
If there's something missing, there's something to gain

God takes care of the little things'b"I have weapons and battle plans
But in my heart I know
I can't ever protect you from
Things I don't understand
And when I hold you in my arms
It scares me just to
Think that something so beautiful
Could just come apart in my hands
I've always been chasing rainbows
Staring out of classroom windows
I don't think I'll ever be happy
Unless I'm unhappy and hugging my grudge
I was too dumb to settle down
So, I packed up and I left town
On a sunshine bus
Wondering where it all went wrong
On a flimsy wing and a prayer
I followed my heart everywhere
'Til I ended up
Right back where I started from
I've always been quietly dreaming
I don't know when I've been beaten
I don't think I'll ever be happy
Unless I'm unhappy and hugging my grudge
I've always been chasing rainbows
Staring out of classroom windows
I don't think I'll ever be happy
Unless I'm unhappy and hugging my grudge
I've always been quietly dreaming
I don't know when I've been beaten
I don't think I'll ever be happy
Unless I'm unhappy and hugging my grudge"b"This town is full of monsters
Holding hands with other monsters
And attempting to be human beings
Shuffling around the shops
And waving at balloons
This town is full of monsters
Sitting on park benches
Eating little packets of Sultanas
Licking chocolate off their chubby little fingers
And I don't know why
It is they scare me but they do
And the thing that really frightens me
Is that all my friends from school
Are turning into monsters
Picking patterns out for curtains
Making friends with all the other monsters
Pushing little baby monsters
Around the shops in prams
This town is full of monsters
Peeping out from under parked cars
In multi-storey car park
Evil little eyes like fairy lights
Blinking in the dark
This town is full of monsters
Making out with other monsters
Picking sweet corn out of their teeth
Dipping pissy little fingers
In the pick 'n' mix
And I don't even know why
It is it scares me but it does
And the thing that really frightens me
Is that the people I used to love
Are turning into monsters
Getting married having babies
Telling me how great their life is
And how happy I would be if I could
Just be more like them"b"I can keep canaries and
cook on a camper stove
eat baked beans with a spoon
and smell of ginger beer
I can potter into town
and pick up your prescriptions
and if you're ever sad I'll pull
potatoes from your ears
potatoes from your ears
Someday when I'm older I will
Rock upon a porch with you
Rock upon a porch with you
Remembering the stupid things
we did when we were young
A hard boiled egg and soldiers in a
cafe with an ocean view
sitting silently across from you
sipping strawberry daiquiris and
twiddling our thumbs
till we grow old
I just want to quietly
collect up my cavalry
Curl up into a little ball
and plot my revenge
and it might sound stupid but
the saddest thing about growing up
is that I will never think
I'm spiderman again
I'm spiderman again
Someday when I'm older I will
Rock upon a porch with you
Rock upon a porch with you
Remembering when I was young
and I still had my own teeth
and it's sad to think that
there might still be
dreams of ours that won't come true
they probably never will come true
and we'll regret the things we didn't do
and suck on travel sweets till we grow old
Someday when I'm older I will
Rock upon a porch with you
Rock upon a porch with you
Remembering the price of Polos
and the books we used to read
'cause somehow after everything and
everyone that we've been through
I'm kind of looking forward to
rocking back and forth with you
on the front steps of our sweet retirement home"b"I was young and I was stupid, I had just turned seventeen
I took my hits on a dumb road trip to Nashville Tennessee
I packed my antihistamines and Tupperware drums
A harmonica and a box guitar
In a canvas covered wagon stuff with apples and with guns
We quietly slipped across the border into Arkansas
But still we couldn't find what it was we were looking for
So we trucked on down to try our luck along the Rio Grande
But I couldn't help but notice how
The little things that used to make us happy, made us sad
But still I'm glad I hitched my apple wagon to your star
I never would've got here if I'd followed my heart
I didn't think much of it till I took it apart
I'm glad I hitched my apple wagon to your star
We never ever made it down to Nashville in the end
And no one ever signed our stupid country disco band
However hard we tried, it never seemed to be enough
We never did get famous
Still it made us kind of happy and it kept me off of drugs
And now I'm glad I hitched my apple wagon to your star
I never would've got here if I'd followed my heart
I didn't think much of it till I took it apart
I'm glad I hitched my apple wagon to your star
But still I'm glad I hitched my apple wagon to your star
I'm happy if you're happy but it breaks my heart
I didn't even notice it 'til it fell apart
I'm glad I hitched my apple wagon to your star"b"I bruise like a peach
I mumble when I speak
I'm in the gutter lookin' at the stars
I've always been in love with you
I look tough enough
But if you hold me up to the light
You can see my broken heart
I've always been in love with you
They're just paper cuts, I'll sellotape them up
And bandage them with cotton wool and glue
Paper cuts, I shouldn't beat myself up
Over little things the way I do
Nothing stays the same
I wish, I could remain the color
Of the cherry blossom tree
I've always been in love with you
I always used to leave
Before I went to sleep
But now I just pass out watching TV
I've always been in love with you
They're just paper cuts, I'll sellotape them up
And bandage them with cotton wool and glue
Paper cuts, I shouldn't beat myself up
Over little things the way I do
Just be careful when you shine
Because if you throw a light
On something magical
It disappears
Paper cuts, I'll sellotape them up
And bandage them with cotton wool and glue
They're just paper cuts, I shouldn't beat myself up
Over little things the way I do
I bruise like a peach
I mumble when I speak

Taking the rough with the smooth
I know it hurts
Me more than it ever would you
Fur soft as fur
Fresh strawberries and cream
Sometimes, at work
I feel like a machine
Dreams don't always come true
The way you want them to
I suppose, this'll have to do
For the time being
Fishes and worms
Frozen under the ice
Sometimes, it hurts
So much, it feels nice
I'm afraid of growing old
And being on my own
So, I'm putting my country shoulder
To the wheel
I'm afraid of letting go
Of everything I know
So I just sadly float
Away down stream
Smiling at the leaves
Chewing butter beans
And wondering what dreams
Are made of fur
Fur, fur soft as fur
Fur so soft it hurts
Fur too soft for words
Fur soft as fur"b"As sweet as a plum and lovely as dawn
Rolling its tongue over its gums
Like tiger and me as happy as could be
Sat out on the porch
As the whole of the sky
Clouds quietly over
And it starts to cry
Softly on my shoulder
We don't want to grow up
But we have to grow up
As sad as I am, I do understand
I do understand, it just makes me sad
My tiger my heart
We're growing apart
We're trying to be friends
But it's hard sometimes
To be friends with something that eats butterflies
And pencil sharpeners
And I think it would be happier being free
My tiger my friend
My little godsend
I know someday, we'll be happy again"b"Warm milk and honey
Sweeten my teeth.
From little acorns you..
You quietly made me..
Made me into me.
Paper thin skin stretched
Over my bones.
From shells and pebbles you..
You quietly made me..?
Made me a home.
But I can't get used
To being alone.
And I won't get used
To being alone.
Under a full moon,
Hopelessly trying to
Retrace our footsteps in the snow.
I don't know when to hang on
And when to let go.
Foxes in boxes,
And butterfly blues.
From little acorns you..
You quietly made me..
Made me into you.
Holding it under
My tongue 'til it stings.
From all of my demons
You quietly saved me
Again and again.
But now I feel
And surface again.
Yes, I can feel
And surface again.
From little bubbles,
Little air bubbles,
Little embolysms grow.
I don't know to hang on.
Everything I feel feels wrong.
I don't know when to hang on
And when to let go."b"Staring up into the solar system
All the stars are fixed up in the sky
I just want to sparkle for a moment
Before I just fizzle out and die
I'm happy because I'm stupid
Scared of spiders, scared of flying
If I wasn't so happy
I wouldn't be so scared of dying
So just be gentle with me
(I'm not as young as I was)
And I'll be gentle with you
I'm not as brave as I thought
'Cause my heart gets broken so easily
So just be gentle, be gentle with me
Wide awake, waiting like a target
Listening for things I cannot see
Insects flutter up against my window
I don't like the way they look at me
I guess I've always needed
To be needed by someone
It's a comforting feeling
Being under someone's thumb
So just be gentle with me
(And if I am ever mean)
And I'll be gentle with you
I never mean to be mean
'Cause I want to pick peaches off of a cherry tree
Just be gentle, be gentle, be gentle, be gentle with me
So just be gentle with me
Trouble is sometimes
And I'll be gentle with you
I just can't switch myself off when I want to so I never do
Because I'm mental, be gentle, be gentle
Just be gentle, be gentle, be gentle
And I'll be gentle, be gentle, be gentle,be gentle with you"b"I've got nothing to worry about,
So I worry about nothing.
I think I've got fleas or some tropical disease
And my spider-sense is tingling.
I've got nothing to panic about,
So I panic about nothing.
I won't buy grapes, I check the 'sell by' dates,
And I only eat fruit out of tins.
I've got the blues,
I've got lifts in my shoes,
And I'm scared of the countryside.
I can't sleep 'cause I see spiders
When I close my eyes.
I've got nothing to be afraid of,
So I'm afraid of nothing.
I've emptied out the cupboard underneath the stairs
Because I think the sky is gonna fall in.
How did I get to be such a
Mess so soon in my life?
I can't sleep 'cause I see spiders
When I close my eyes.
All I ever wanted to be
Was comfortable and kind.
I can't sleep 'cause I see spriders
When I close my eyes.
I'd love to go to San Francisco,
But I'm too afraid to fly.
I can't help it, I see spiders
When I close my eyes."b"Pushing through the topsoil, I'm blinking in the light
Shading my eyes from the morning sun
I just wish that I could still see the world sometimes
The way I saw the world when I was young
Sleeping with a gun, sleeping with a gun
Sleeping with a gun under my pillow
Sometimes it gets lonely, being valiantly alone
Sometimes I wish I was there with you
I get sad just thinking of all the little things
I never ever had the heart to do
Sleeping with a gun, sleeping with a gun
Sleeping with a gun under my pillow"b'Warm panda cola by the mountain the in the sun

Since we took down our little tree
Packed all the baubles and tinsel away
And left it out on the street
It's almost December, it's nearly a year
Since you just left me suddenly
Packed up a suitcase while I was asleep
And quietly crept out on me
(I still find...)
Blue spruce needles under the couch when I clean
(It reminds...)
Me that people fall out of love as easily as in
(I still find...)
Blue spruce needles whenever I sweep out my heart
If Christmas is about being together,
Then how can it be Christmas if we are apart?
It's almost December, it's nearly a year

Yo no intento discutirtelo, lo sabes y lo se.
Al menos quedate solo esta noche,
prometo no tocarte, estas segura.

con cada hombre hay una como tu.
Pero mi sitio, luego,
lo ocuparas con alguno

recuerda que tambien a ti te he perdonado,
y en cambio tu dices: "lo siento... no te quiero",
y te me vas con esta historia entre tus dedos.
Que vas a hacer?
Busca una excusa y luego marchate,
porque de mi no debieras preocuparte,
no debes provocarme.

tratando de ocultar mis emociones.

El auto nuevo antes de graduarse
Que viviera lo que t\xc3\x83\xc2\xba no has vivido.
No basta con creerse
Un padre excelente
Porque eso te dice la gente
A tus hijos nunca les falta nada.
No basta porque cuando quiso
Hablarte de sexo
Se te subieron los colores al rostro
Y te fuiste.

Tenido un problema

No basta cuando lo que necesita es afecto
Aprender a dar valor a las cosas

A veces no conoce fronteras y se desboca de mala manera
Me arrastra como el agua del rio entre calor y frio

Y a veces me lleva tan lejos, donde nunca he estado
A veces se me pierde y vuelve al rato

Y a veces se me muestra desnudo, tan fr\xc3\x83\xc2\xa1gil y puro

Y habl\xc3\x83\xc2\xa1bamos de todo un poco,
Y todo nos causaba risa
Como dos tontos.

De tenerte en mis brazos
Y poderte decir
Te amo
Desde el primer momento en que te vi
Y hace tiempo te buscaba
Y ya te imaginaba as\xc3\x83\xc2\xad.
Te amo
Aunque no es tan f\xc3\x83\xc2\xa1cil de decir,

Con estas palabras

Uno al otro.
Tus manos entre las m\xc3\x83\xc2\xadas
Tal vez nos volveremos a ver

Que si pienso demasiado
Que sin ti yo estoy perdido

Tal vez estoy muy mal herido

Que no se puede aguantar
Parece que mis besos ya no
Te sirven de nada

Por un rato, me sent\xc3\x83\xc2\xad seguro
Y libre como el pensamiento
Como para no volver.
Y se nos fue la noche entera,
Entre besos y quimeras,
Debajo de una luna llena
Y nos dijimos pocas cosas,
Justo lo que nuestras bocas,
Quedaban libres para hablar
Y nos perdimos en la noche plata y negra,
Y ah\xc3\x83\xc2\xad comprend\xc3\x83\xc2\xad que vivir vale la pena.
Y volamos, fuera de este mundo
Por un rato, me sent\xc3\x83\xc2\xad seguro

Tanto amor no se concibe en un segundo.
Y volamos, fuera de este mundo
Por un rato me sent\xc3\x83\xc2\xad seguro
Y libre como el pensamiento
Como para no volver.

Si ya no nos queda nada porque luchar
Cuando ya nada sera igual.
No quiero causarte mas problemas en tu vida
Que con los que tienes creo que son suficientes
Y porque dejamos que esto se fuera tan lejos
Que se nos escapara de las manos
Y que nos juramos que esto nunca iba a pasar

Porque yo no lo se, no

Ese trueno anuncia la lluvia
Las palomas se refugian
Luego de volar muy libres
Dando vueltas al campanario
El cielo se torna oscuro
Why de repente por el Este un relmpago
Why se sabe que tan duro ser el trueno
Se deslizan por mis dedos
Las primeras gotas
Transportadas por el viento
Que a medida van cayendo
Que ya duro esta lloviendo
Why es mejor me pongo dentro
Lluvia, lluvia, lluvia, lluvia, lluvia, lluvia, lluvia, lluvia
No me pidas que te quiera que no te puedo querer
Lluvia, lluvia, lluvia, lluvia, lluvia, lluvia, lluvia, lluvia
Si esta vez me toca a mi yo lo quisiera saber
why as dura bastante tiempo
Cae sobre mi ciudad, nadie la puede frenar
Ella sola parara, unos la bendeciran
A otros les dar igual, pero algunos les har dao
Mucho dao les har
Why termina de repente
Why de la tierra se desprende
El olor que queda luego
El olor que queda luego
Mira el nio hacia el cielo
Sin su techo habr quedado
Why no le queda mas remedio
Ya esta como acostumbrado

Como poder olvidar
Las noches, los d\xc3\x83\xc2\xadas, las cosas vividas
Nuestra manera de amar

Se agotan mis fuerzas, se ahogan mis ansias

Ella me estremece con su forma de andar
Ella tiene algo que no puedo evitar
Cuando yo la veo no me puedo controlar
Ella sabe bien lo que a mi me esta pasando
Notara que yo por dentro me estoy quemando
Por eso se protege pero yo se muy bien que ella
Ella esta loca por mi
Tomas una copa o tal vez te provoca
Damos un paseo a la orilla del mar
Tal vez no le gusta que la inviten a pasear
As\xc3\x83\xc2\xad de primera yo me puedo equivocar
Ella mientras tanto sigue hablando con su amiga
De vez en cuando mira y me lanza una sonrisa
Yo se que lo esta haciendo para hacerme sufrir, yo se
Que ella esta loca por mi
As\xc3\x83\xc2\xad me decido a tratar de una vez
Un toque en el pelo, la mirada al espejo
As\xc3\x83\xc2\xad me le acerco y le digo buenas noches
Ella se voltea y me contesta por igual
Ten\xc3\x83\xc2\xada la voz muy gruesa y las manos como grandes
Y su pelo rubio no parece natural
Me quede de pie y solo pude decir
Lo siento, cre\xc3\x83\xc2\xad que eras otra persona
Ella esta loca por mi
Cre\xc3\x83\xc2\xad que eras otra persona
Solo me pasa a mi
Por no mirar bien
Ella esta loca por mi

No, eso no, eso no

But after waiting several hours I found out you were gone
I was a little underwhelmed with all the pictures you took
But that one over in the corner caught you in a good look
Have you ever been afraid of someone getting so close?
I mean it's natural for a person to hold on to it most
That is their privacy and I can see you're feeling like that
So I'll unbreak the window and unpick the lock in the back
I don't know if she'll remember my name, the minute we're finally alone.
But she'll not forget when she sees me again, 'cause I will make sure that she won't.
It's so easy, I guess it's easy enough, enough.
'Cause you're so easy, you're just so easy to love, to love.
I walked around until i couldn't quite remember my name
And got all covered in your sheets 'til I forgot why I came.
Oh yes I hope she doesn't mind all of the glass on the floor
Surely she'll be happy to see me when she walks through the door.
I don't think that she'll remember my name, whenever she finally gets home.
But I'm gonna make sure she knows who I am and then she will not be alone.
It's so easy, I guess it's easy enough, enough.
'Cause you're so easy, you're just so easy to love, to love.
It's so easy, I guess it's easy enough, enough.
'Cause you're so easy, you're just so easy to love, to love.
I can see you, but you can't see me.
I can see you, you look so pretty.
I can see you, but you can't see me.
Maybe one day, you'll be my sweetie.
But you can't see me, but you can't see me.
It's so easy, I guess it's easy enough, enough.
'Cause you're so easy, you're just so easy to love, to love."b"Don't unplug me or just shut me down
Please just love me with your steel heart
I'd reboot you if you'd look at me
With those cold eyes one more time
I remember our software was compatible
I think I felt my circuit board ignite
You held my hand in your metallic grip
We may be machines, but I'm in love tonight
Baby, there's something I have to say
I think it's time for my upgrade
I would look so good in version two
But I promise it's me, not you
Don't unplug me or, or, or just shut me down
Please just love me with, with your steel heart
I'd reboot you if, if you'd look at me
With those cold eyes one, one more time
Can you hear me, you haven't moved an inch
Is there system failure, what should I do
Your new interface, it seems to have some bugs
You're not responding, I think they broke you
Hello, and welcome to version two
Tell me what can I do for you
What is a hug, that does not compute
Please stand by for my system reboot
Don't unplug me or, or, or just shut me down
Please just love me with, with your steel heart
I'd reboot you if, if you'd look at me
With those cold eyes one, one more time
I just got the memo about this upgrade to version two
It removes extraneous programs
That means emotions like loving you
I don't want to lose myself or ever say goodbye
I wanna hold on to my consciousness
I don't wanna die
I remember our software was compatible
I think I felt my circuit board ignite
You held my hand in your metallic grip
We may be machines, but I'm in love tonight
Don't unplug me or, or, or just shut me down
Please, please love me with, with your steel heart
I'd reboot you if, if you'd look at me
With those cold eyes one, one more time
Don't unplug me or, or, or just shut me down
Please just love me with, with your steel heart
I'd reboot you if, if you'd look at me
With those cold eyes one, one more time
One more time"b"You would not believe your eyes
I know that it sounds unwise
She's so smart, and yeah, she's just a friend
But she lit up the Yule Ball
My heart pushed against a wall
Just frozen, staring here in the Great Hall
I'd like to make myself believe
That she would look back at me
It's hard to say I'd rather leave than see her here with him
But everything is never as it seems with Hermione
I've gotten a thousand hugs just tonight from Victor Krum
The Durmstrang boy who gave me a chance
But something just isn't right
It's not how I viewed tonight
I wasted time waiting for Ron's invite
I'd like to make myself believe
That stupid boy would ask me
It's hard to say cause he's stubborn and a pig and fights with me
But everything is never as it seems with Ron Weasley
Oh Ronald Weasley, you're the worst
Please take me away from here
Maybe next time you should ask me first
Please take me away from here
Victor's dumb, but he treats me right
Please take me away from here
Now excuse me while I enjoy my night
Cause I'd cast a thousand charms
She makes me feel so unarmed
I wonder if Harry's noticed yet
Oh he can be such a slime
But even if she's not mine
I won't give up, these things just take time
I'd like to make myself believe
That someday you'll fall for me
It's not like I'm gonna tell you to your face or anything
But 'til it happens I'll still have my dreams of you and me
I'd like to make myself believe
That someday you'll fall for me
It's not like I'm gonna tell you to your face or anything
But 'til it happens I'll still have my dreams of you and me
I'd like to make myself believe
That someday you'll fall for me
It's not like I'm gonna tell you to your face or anything
Cause I am too afraid you'd disagree"b"Sedikit waktu yang kau miliki

thought we can really make it
in the beginning ooh it was all right

Time went by how happy we were
tears in my eyes show what is left today
memories of you and me take the best of me
Then we lost balance everything changed
time was no healer
the love that we used to have so great so true
had turned out to be a bad dream
Time passes on and I stand alone

I pray that is's not a sign

your memory is the only thing
that is left for me

Otra vez que se me vuelve a hacer de noche,
Otra vez no entiendo nada, pero busco esa palabra

Y el amor se agrieta por las dudas, por los celos
Y se cuelan las cenizas, los reproches y los miedos
Y empieza a resquebrajare como un trocito de hielo

A ver si el otro lo arregla porque queremos salvarnos
Pero no sabemos como.
Y otra vez mi mundo se pone a dar vueltas

Otra vez regresa el nudo a la garganta,
La salida de emergencia, buscar esa sentencia
Que me sirva de guerrero en la batalla.

Whispers the sound of my heart
Long enough to share
Whenever you feel
Feel like you need what I need
Take me to the rhythm"b"Ain't no sunshine
When he's gone
It's not warm when he's away
Ain't no sunshine
When he's gone
And he's always gone too long
Any time he goes away
Wonder this time
Where he's gone
Wonder if he's gonna stay
Ain't no sunshine
When he's gone
This house
Just ain't no home
Any time he goes away
And I know,I know,I know,I know
You know the reason
Why he packed up
Like he didn't hear you
When you said
He ought to back up
It's alright he enticed you
With that pillow talk
Not you this time it's him
Who's going to take a walk
Right down memory lane
Your name is not lois
And he ain't Forrest Gump
So bump he pumped
Cause he ain't real
Just kick it
Like brandy on the move
Hey, I'm gonna
Leave young thing alone
But ain't no sunshine
When he's gone"b"Performer: Elhaida Dani

Song composer(s): Arber Elshani, Kristijan Lekaj (Zzap'n'Chriss)
I was too afraid right from the start
To even let you, welcome you in my heart
You cut it deep and left it bleeding hard
Will i ever heal these painful scars?
I just can't help it
I'm out of breath, I'm try and find the words to say
Time pass' by
Now its broad daylight
I know you'll come
With the speed of light
You're my everything , all that I need.
You shut down my dreams
But I'm not gonna cry
You live within me, that's why I'm alive
I am alive
Cuz you are my life,
You are my sun,
I am alive, cuz you are my life.
Your name is printed crystal clear on glass..
From all the sighs, coming out' my breath
I'm blinded by,
This love can't stop screaming out your name so loud
Where are you at?
Baby won't you come back?
I know you'll come
With the speed of light
You're my everything , all that I need.
You shut down my dreams
But I'm not gonna cry
You live within me, that's why I'm alive
I am alive
Cuz you are my life,
You are my sun,
I am alive, cuz you are my life."b"Un\xc3\x83\xc2\xab jam nj\xc3\x83\xc2\xab det ku ti lundron

And wont let him get the best of you

Rip up to something new

From the midnight well
For it's dark and evil, so they say
The midnight well
They'll tell you a tale of a lovely young maid
The fairest that they'd ever known
What a beauty, they say
But she went her own way
On that night, she set out on her own
For they say, she had a rendezvous
At the midnight well
With a gypsy man she barely knew
At the midnight well
Nobody knew where he came from
But they remember the fire in his eyes
His earring of gold
And his hair black as coal
And a look that could just hypnotize
When he said
Come away, come away with me
Come here and lay with me
Come away out of the light
Come away, come away
Come and ride with me into the night
Never more, they never saw her face
At the midnight well
She was gone, and never left a trace
At the midnight well
They say when the summer nights come to an end
The harvest moon glows in the sky
A black horse will appear and a sound you will hear
As the ghost of a gypsy flies by
And he says
Come away, come away with me
Come here and lay with me
Come away out of the light
Come away, come away
Come and ride with me into the night
Come away, come away with me
Come here and lay with me
Come away out of the light
Come away, come away
Come and ride with me into the night
Come away, come away with me
Come here and lay with me
Come away out of the light
Come away, come away
Come and ride with me into the night"b"I am a lineman for the county.
And I drive the main road,
Lookin' in the sun for another overload.
I hear you singing in the wire.
I can hear you through the whine.
And the Wichita Lineman
Is still on the line.
I know I need a small vacation.
But it don't look like rain.
And if it snows that stretch down south
Won't ever stand the strain.
And I need you more than want you.
And I want you for all time.
And the Wichita Lineman
Is still on the line."b'(Instrumental)'b'When I am down and, oh my soul, so weary,
When troubles come and my heart burdened be,
Then, I am still and wait here in the silence,
Until you come and sit awhile with me.
You raise me up, so I can stand on mountains,
You raise me up, to walk on stormy seas,
I am strong, when I am on your shoulders,
You raise me up, to more than I can be.
You raise me up, so I can stand on mountains,
You raise me up, to walk on stormy seas,
I am strong, when I am on your shoulders,
You raise me up, to more than I can be.
You raise me up, so I can stand on mountains,
You raise me up, to walk on stormy seas,
I am strong, when I am on your shoulders,
You raise me up, to more than I can be.
You raise me up, so I can stand on mountains,
You raise me up, to walk on stormy seas,
I am strong, when I am on your shoulders,
You raise me up, to more than I can be.
You raise me up, to more than I can be.'b"Well how do you do, young Willy McBride,
Do you mind if I sit here down by your graveside,
And rest for a while 'neath the warm summer sun,
I've been walking all day and I'm nearly done.
I see by your gravestone you were only 19,
You joined the great fallin' in 1916.
Well I hope you died quick, and I hope you died clean.
Willy McBride, was it slow and obscene?
[Chorus:]
Did they beat the drums slowly,
Did they play the fife lowly?
Did they sound a death march as they lowered you down?
Did the band play the last post and chorus?
Did the pipes play the flowers of the forest?
Did you leave a wife or a sweetheart behind,
In some faithful heart, is your memory in shrine?
And though you died back in 1916,
In that faithful heart, you're forever 19.
Or are you a stranger without even a name,
Enclosed forever behind a glass pane.
In an old photograph, torn and battered and stained,
And faded to yellow in a brown yellow frame.
[Chorus]
Now Willy McBride, I can't help wondering why
Do those who lie here know why they died.
Did they really believe when they answered the cause,
Did they really believe that this war would end wars?
But the sorrow, the sufferin', the glory, the pain
The killing and dying were all done in vain.
But, Willy McBride, it all happened again, and again, and again, and again, and again.
[Chorus]
Did the pipes play the flowers of the forest?"b"It's a working man I am
And I've been down underground
And I swear to God
If I ever see the sun
Oh for any length of time
I can hold it in my mind
I never again
Will go down underground
At the age of sixteen years
Oh he quarrels with his peers
He vowed they'd never
See another one
In the dark recess of the mine
Where you age before your time
And the coal dust lies heavy
On your lungs
It's a working man I am
And I've been down underground
And I swear to God
If I ever see the sun
Oh for any length of time
I can hold it in my mind
I never again
Will go down underground
At the age of sixty four
He will greet you at the door
And he will gently lead you
By the arm
Through the dark recess of the mine
He will take you back in time
And he'll tell you of
The hardships that were had
It's a working man I am
And I've been down underground
And I swear to God
If I ever see the sun
Oh for any length of time
I can hold it in my mind
I never again will go down underground
I never again will go down underground"b"Guarda fuori e'gia'mattina
Questo e'un giorno che ricorderai
Alzati in fretta e vai
C'e chi crede in te
Non ti arrendere
Once in every life
There comes a time
We walk out all alone
And into the light
The moment won't last but then,
We remember it again
When we close our eyes.
Like stars across the sky
E per a vincere
Tu dovrai vincere
We were born to shine
All of us here because we believe
Guarda avanti e non voltarti mai
Accarezza con I sogni tuoi
Le tue speranze e poi
Verso il giorno che verra
C'e un traguardo la
Like stars across the sky
E per a vincere
Tu dovrai vincere
We were born to shine
All of us here because we believe
Non arrenderti
Qualcuno e con te
Like stars across the sky
We were born to shine
E per a vincere
Dovrai vincere
E allora vincerai"b"Don't take your love away from me
Don't you leave my heart in misery
If you go then I'll be blue
'cause breaking up his hard to do
Remember when, you held me tight
And you kissed me all through the night
Think of all that we've been through
Breaking up is hard to do
They say that breaking up is hard to do
Now I know I know that it's true
Don't say that this is the end
Instead of breaking up I wish that we were making up again
I beg of you don't say goodbye
Can't we give our love another try
Come on baby let's start a new
'cause breaking up is hard to do
I beg of you don't say goodbye
Can't we give our love another try
Come on baby let's start a new
'cause breaking up is hard to do
Breaking up is hard to do"b"(Ryan)
I sit here thinking
As the sun is sinking
Over the mountain
And the dry, dusty ground

As the night is falling
I start recalling
The nights
In my own town

I see the faces
In familiar places
I hear the music
That they played way back then

My heart rejoices
As I hear the voices
Calling me
Home again

Home
Oh take me home
Oh to the people
I left behind
Oh to the love
I know I'll find
Oooh take me home

As the sky is burning
My mind is turning
To the cold winter evenings
By my own fire side

So far away now
But any day now
I'll sail
On the morning tide

Home
Oh take me home
Oh to the people
I left behind
Oh to the love
I know I'll find
Oooh take me home

Far across the sea

You belong to me
And my poor heart aches
Every step you take
Every move you make
Every vibe you break
Every smile you fake
Every claim you stake
I'll be watching you
Since you've gone
I've been lost
Without a trace
Dream at night
I can only see your face
Look around,but
It's you I can't replace
Feel so cold
But, I long
For your embrace
Keep crying, baby, baby
Oh can't you see
You belong to me
And my poor heart aches

My little tomboy now wears satin and lace
I can't believe my eyes
You're just a teenage dream
Happy birthday sweet sixteen

Then when you were ten we didn't like each other
When you were thirteen, you were my funny valentine
But since you've grown up the future is sown up
From now on you're gonna be mine
So, if I should smile with sweet surprise
It's just that you've grown up before my very eyes

I'll only stay awhile
I want to hear how you're getting on
I want to see you smile
I'm happy to be back again
And greet you big and small
For there's no place else on this earth quite like
The homes of Donegal
I long to see your smiling children
Standing by the door
The kettle boiling on the hearth
As I walked up the floor
And then to see a waiting for me
Travellers one and all
For your heart's alive in your mountain size
In the homes of Donegal
I like to lie, lie along with you
While away at night
With fairy lore and tales of yore
Beside the surf fire bright
And then to see laid out for me
A shake-down by the wall
For there's rest for weary wanderers
In the homes of Donegal
Donegal, queen of all
Donegal, queen of all"b'When you wish upon a star

The sweet fulfillment of your secret longing

Fate steps in and pulls you through

The sweet fulfillment of their secret longing

Everywhere you go
Take a look in the five and ten glistening once again
With candy canes and silver lanes aglow
It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas
Toys in every store
But the prettiest sight to see, is the holly that will be
On your own front door
A pair of hop-along boots and a pistol that shoots
Is the wish of Barney and Ben
Dolls that will talk and will go for a walk
Is the hope of Janice and Jen
And mom and dad can hardly wait for school to start again
It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas
Everywhere you go
There's a tree in the Grand Hotel, one in the park as well,
The sturdy kind that doesn't mind the snow
It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas
Soon the bells will start,
And the thing that will make them ring is the carol that will sing
Within your heart
A pair of hop-along boots and a pistol that shoots
Is the wish of Barney and Ben
Dolls that will talk and will go for a walk
Is the hope of Janice and Jen
And mom and dad can hardly wait for school to start again"b"Two girls for every boy

And she cruised through the hamburger stand now
Seems she forgot all about the library
Like she told her old man now
And with the radio blasting
Goes cruising just as fast as she can now

'Til her daddy takes the T-Bird away
And she'll have fun fun fun

In the lane, snow is glistening
A beautiful sight,
Oh we're happy tonight.
Walking in a winter wonderland.
Gone away is the bluebird,
Here to stay is a new bird
He singing a song,
As we go along,
Walking in a winter wonderland.
In the meadow we can build a snowman,
And pretend that he is Parson Brown
He'll say: Are you married?
We'll say: No man,
But you can do the job
When you're in town.
Later on, we'll conspire,
As we dream by the fire
To face unafraid,
All the plans that we've made,
Walking in a winter wonderland.
In the meadow we can build a snowman,
And pretend that he's a circus clown
We'll have lots of fun with mister snowman,
Until the other kiddies knock him down.
When it snows, ain't it thrilling,
Though your nose gets a chilling
We'll frolic and play, the Eskimo way,
Walking in a winter wonderland.
Walking in a winter wonderland.
Walking in a winter wonderland."b'[Chorus]
Last Christmas, I gave you my heart
But the very next day, you gave it away
This year, to save me from tears
I\'ll give it to someone special
Last Christmas, I gave you my heart
And the very next day, you gave it away
This year, to save me from tears
I\'ll give it to someone special
Once bitten, twice shy
I keep my distance but you still catch my eye
Tell me baby well do you recognize me?
It\'s been a year, it doesn\'t surprise me
(Happy Christmas!)
I wrapped it up and sent it
With a note saying "I love you" I meant it
Now I know what a fool I\'ve been
But if you kissed me now, you\'d fool me again
[Chorus]
A crowded room, friends with tired eyes
I\'m hiding from you and your soul of ice
My God I thought you were someone to rely on
Me? I guess I was a shoulder to cry on
A face on a lover with a fire in his heart
A man undercover, when you tore me apart
Now I\'ve found a real love you\'ll never fool me again
[Chorus]
Gave you my heart
This year, to save me from tears
I\'ll give it to someone special
Last Christmas'b'When marimba rhythms start to play

Bend with me, sway with ease
When we dance, you have a way with me
Stay with me, sway with me
Other dancers may be on the floor
Dear, but my eyes with see only you
Only you have the magic technique
When we sway I go weak
I can hear the sound of violins
Long before it begins
Make me thrill as only you know how
Sway me smooth, sway me now
Other dancers may be on the floor
Dear, but my eyes with see only you
Only you have the magic technique
When we sway I go weak

Hold me close, sway me more
Hold me close, sway me more

That David played, and it pleased the Lord

Her beauty in the moonlight overthrew you
She tied you to her kitchen chair
And she broke your throne, and she cut your hair
And from your lips she drew the Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Maybe there's a God above
But all I've ever learned from love
Was how to shoot somebody who out drew you
It's not a cry that you hear at night
It's not someone who has seen the light
It's a cold and it's a broken Hallelujah

You see he stand about six foot four

All the men just call him "Sir"

Badder than old King Kong
And meaner than a junkyard dog

And he likes his fancy clothes
And he likes to wave his diamond rings
In front of everybody\'s nose
He got a custom Continental
He got an Eldorado too
He got a 32 gun in his pocket for fun
He got a razor in his shoe

Now Friday \'bout a week ago
Leroy shootin\' dice
And at the edge of the bar
Sat a girl named Doris
And ooh that girl looked nice
Well he cast his eyes upon her
And the trouble soon began
And Leroy Brown learned a lesson \'bout messin\'
With the wife of a jealous man

Well the two men took to fighting
And when they pulled them from the floor
Leroy looked like a jigsaw puzzle
With a couple of pieces gone

Badder than old King Kong
And meaner than a junkyard dog

Then your rosy cheek's gonna light my merry way
Now the frosty paws appear
And they've frozen up my ears
So we'll lie by the fire

From each other

I will make it up to you

Wouldn't want to be swept away
Far away
From the one that I love
Hold me now
Its hard for me to say I'm sorry
I just want you know
Hold me now
I really want to tell you I'm sorry
I could never let you go
After all that we've been through
I will make it up to you
I promise to
After all that's been said and done
You're just a part of me I can't let go
After all that we've been through
I will make it up to you
I promise to
After all that's been said and done
You're just a part of me I can't let go
After all that we've been through
I will make it up to you
I promise to
I do"b"I don't want a lot for Christmas
There's just one thing I need
I don't care about the presents
Underneath the Christmas tree
I just want you for my own
More than you could ever know
You make my wish come true
All I want for Christmas
Is you
I don't want a lot for Christmas
There's just one thing I need
I don't care about the presents
Underneath the Christmas tree
I don't need to hang my stocking
There upon the fireplace
Santa Claus won't make me happy
With a toy on Christmas day
I just want you for my own
More than you could ever know
You make my wish come true
All I want for Christmas is you
You baby
I won't ask for much this Christmas
I don't even wish for snow
I'm just gonna keep on waiting
Underneath the mistletoe
And I won't make a list and send it
To the North Pole for Saint Nick
I won't even stay awake to
Hear those magic reindeers click
And I just want you here tonight
Holding on to me so tight
What more can I do
Baby all I want for Christmas is you
You baby
All the lights are shining
So brightly everywhere
And the sound of children's laughter fills the air
Everyone is singing
I hear those sleigh bells ringing
Santa won't you bring me the one I really need
Won't you please bring my baby to me
Oh I don't want a lot for Christmas
There is just one thing I need
I just want to see my baby
Standing right outside my door
And I just want you for my own
More than you could ever know
You make my wish come true
Baby all I want for Christmas
Is you
You baby
You
All I want for Christmas is you"b'Amazing grace, how sweet the sound
That saved a wretch like me
I once was lost but now am found
Was blind but now I see
Twas grace that taught my heart to fear
And grace my fears relieved
How precious did that grace appear
The hour I first believed
Amazing grace, how sweet the sound
That saved a wretch like me
I once was lost but now am found
Was blind but now I see
Though many dangers, toils, and snares
I have already come
Twas grace that brought me safe thus far
And grace will lead me home'b"You're strutting into town like you're slinging a gun
Just a small-town dude with a big city attitude
Honey are you looking for some trouble tonight?
Well, alright
You think you're so bad drive the women folk wild
Shoot 'em all down with a flash of your pearly smile
Honey, but you met your match tonight
Oh, that's right
You think you'll knock me off my feet 'til I'm flat on the floor
'Til my heart is crying Indian and I'm begging for more
So come on baby
Come on baby
Come on baby show me what that loaded gun is for
If you can give it
I can take it
Cause if this heart is gonna break, its gonna take a lot to break it
I know tonight somebody is gonna win the fight
So if you're so tough
Come on and prove it
Your heart is down for the count and you know you're gonna lose it
Tonight you're gonna go down in flames
Just like Jesse James
You break the laws of love in the name of desire
Take ten steps back
Cause I'm ready baby
Aim and fire
Baby, there's nowhere you're gonna run tonight
Oh, that's right
Well, you've had your way with love, but its the end of the day
Now a team of wild horses couldn't drag your heart away
So come on baby
Come on baby
Come on baby
Come on
If you can give it
I can take it
Cause if this heart is gonna break, it's gonna take a lot to break it
I know tonight somebody's gonna win the fight
So if you're so tough
Come on and prove it
Your heart is down for the count, and you know you're gonna lose it
Tonight you're gonna go down in flames
Just like Jesse James
Tonight you're gonna go down in flames
Just like Jesse James"b'(Instrumental)'b"I really can't stay
Baby, it's cold outside
I've got to go away
Baby, it's cold outside
This evening has been
Been hoping that you'd drop in
So very nice
I'll hold your hands, they're just like ice
My mother will start to worry
Beautiful words you're humming
And father will be pacing the floor
Listen to the fireplace roar
So really I'd better scurry
Sweetheart, what's you're hurry?
Well, maybe just a half a drink more
Why don't you put some records on while I pour
The neighbors might think
But baby, it's bad out there
Say, what's in this drink?
No cabs to be had out there
I wish I knew how
Your eyes are like starlight now
To break the spell
I'll take your hat, your hairs looks swell
I ought to say no, no, no sir
Mind if I move a little closer?
At least I'm gonna say that I tried
What's the sense in hurting my pride?
I really can't stay
Baby, don't hold out
Oh, but it's cold outside
I simply must go
Baby it's cold outside
The answer is no
But baby it's cold out there
The welcome has been
How lucky that you dropped in
So nice and warm
Look out the window at that storm
My sister will be suspicious
Girl, your lips look delicious
My brother will be there at the door
Like waves upon a tropical shore
My maiden aunt's mind is vicious
Oh, baby, you're so delicious
Well, maybe just a cigarette more
Never such a blizzard before
I got to get home
Oh baby, you'll freeze out there
Say, lend me a coat
It's up to your knees out there
You've really been grand
I'm thrilled when you touch my hand
Why don't you see?
How can you do this thing to me?
There's bound to be talk tomorrow
Making my lifelong sorrow
At least there will be plenty implied
If you caught pneumonia and died
I really can't stay
Get over that hold out
Ah, but it's cold outside
Baby, it's cold outside
Come on, stay a little longer
Okay"b"When I was a younger man
When I was a silly boy
I didn't need a thing,
I was strong as anything,
I viewed solitude as a joy
But since I met you I'm distraught
You wandered in and now I'm caught
I never thought I would see
Someone so truly good
Some one who's so everything I'm not
I want to spend my life with you
Don't want to live all alone
I can't conceive of the years left in me
Without you in our home
But what if, what if, what if what
If it's not perfect then it's not
With every care I'll take
One thing I won't forsake
To dwell beside what you've got
Every time I think about you
I think I can't live without you
I'll tell you something
I am nothing without you
I want to spend my life with you
I don't want to live all alone
I can't conceive of the years left in me
Without you in our home
I want to spend my life with you
Don't want to live all alone
I can't conceive of the years left in me
Without you in our home"b'It\'s the most wonderful time of the year.
With the kids jingle belling,
And everyone telling you,
"Be of good cheer,"
It\'s the most wonderful time of the year.
It\'s the hap-happiest season of all
With those holiday greetings and gay happy meetings
When friends come to call
It\'s the hap-happiest season of all
There\'ll be parties for hosting,
Marshmallows for toasting
And caroling out in the snow.
There\'ll be scary ghost stories and
Tales of the glories of Christmases
Long, long ago.
It\'s the most wonderful time of the year.
There\'ll be much mistletoeing
And hearts will be glowing,
When loved ones are near.

Beside a wind-up gramophone, beneath a pile of junk
And in that dusty attic I enjoyed a music show
Listening to the melodies of eighty years ago
Doo wacka, doo wacka, doo wacka, doo wacka, doo
The band would play
Doo wacka, doo wacka, doo wacka, doo
They'd danced the night away
I long for all the magic and the days of cabaret
Bring back those good old melodies of yesterday
Bring back those good old melodies of yesterday
In my youth, I studied music and it taught me how to sing
Bella signora
They took me to the opera and I loved that kind of thing
But then I'd listen to the stories that my grandpa used to tell
About the 'Roaring Twenties' and the songs he knew so well
Doo wacka, doo wacka, doo wacka, doo wacka, doo
The band would play
Doo wacka, doo wacka, doo wacka, doo
They'd danced the night away
I long for all the magic and the days of cabaret
Bring back those good old melodies of yesterday
Bring back those good old melodies of yesterday
Then he'd talk about the flappers and the way they used to dance
About the bootleg liquor and the ballrooms of romance
Then later in the movies there's dancing everywhere
My grandpa said he dreamed that he could move like Fred Astaire
Oh, doo wacka, doo wacka, doo wacka, doo wacka, doo
The band would play
Doo wacka, doo wacka, doo wacka, doo
They'd danced the night away
I long for all the magic and the days of cabaret
Bring back those good old melodies of yesterday
Bring back those good old melodies of yesterday"b"I have climbed highest mountains
I have run through the fields
Only to be with you, only to be with you
I have run, I have crawled
I have scaled these city walls
These city walls only to be with you
But I still haven't found
What I'm looking for
But I still haven't found
What I'm looking for
I have kissed honey lips
Felt the healing fingertips
Burned like a fire, this burning desire
I have spoke with tongue of angels
I have held the hand of a devil
It was warm in the night, I was cold as a stone
But I still haven't found
What I'm looking for
But I still haven't found
What I'm looking for
But I still haven't found
What I'm looking for
But I still haven't found
What I'm looking for
But I still haven't found
What I'm looking for
But I still haven't found
What I'm looking for
I have climbed highest mountains
I have run through the fields
Only to be with you, only to be with you
But I still haven't found
What I'm looking for
But I still haven't found
What I'm looking for
But I still haven't found
What I'm looking for"b"Don't mind the snow that's falling
The carol singer's calling
I'm just happy to be spending our first Christmas together
And I'll be more than jolly
With the mistletoe and holly
Tonight as we are counting down to Christmas
Together, you and me
With those jingle bells ringing
As I'm holding you near
I'll be making a toast
May tonight be the most
Unforgettable night of the year
The sound of jingle bells and laughter
Will remind us ever after
Of how we spent that magically first Christmas
Together, you and me
Just you and me
With those jingle bells ringing
As I'm holding you near
I'll be making a toast
May tonight be the most
Unforgettable night of the year, the year
Cuddle up and cozy
The future's looking rosy
And I can us spending every Christmas
Together just, you and me
Just you and me
Just you and me
Just you and me"b"Going home for Christmas
Can't wait to be on my way
To see once more the folks I've been missing
This long and many a day
Can't wait to get that old feeling
Being back where I belong
I saved my fare and I'll soon be there
It's Christmas and I'm going home
Going home for Christmas
And the welcome that's waiting there
I'll say goodbye to the lights of Broadway
Farewell to old Times Square
My home is plain and simple
It's the place I was born
And Bleeker Street just can't compete
It's Christmas and I'm going home
I saved my fare and I'll soon be there
It's Christmas and I'm going home
Going home for Christmas
The way that it used to be
See the candle burning there in the window
Fairy lights on the tree
Hear the laughter of the children
See the wonder in their eyes
Bring on the snow and the mistletoe
It's Christmas and I'm going home
Bring on the snow and the mistletoe
It's Christmas and I'm going home
I'm going home"b'Ave Maria

Is come and gone away
In Paris and Rome
But I wanna go home
Mm
Maybe surrounded by
A million people I
Still feel all alone
Just wanna go home
I miss you, you know
And I've been keeping all the letters that I wrote to you
Each one a line or two
'I'm fine baby, how are you?'
Well I would send them but I know that it's just not enough
My words were cold and flat
And you deserve more than that
Another airplane
Another sunny place
I'm lucky I know
But I wanna go home
I've got to go home
Let me go home
I'm just too far from where you are
I wanna come home
And it feel just like I'm living someone elses life
It's like I just stepped outside
When everything was going right
And I know just why you could not
Come along with me
Cause this was not your dream
But you always believed in me
Another winter day has come
And gone away
And even Paris and Rome
I wanna go home
Let me go home
And I'm surrounded by
A million people I
Still feel alone
Let go home
I miss you, you know
Let me go home
I'm just too far from where you are
I wanna come home
Let me go home
It'll all be all right
I'll be home tonight
I'm coming back home"b"Hello again, hello
Just called to say hello
I couldn't sleep at all tonight
I know it's late
But I couldn't wait
Hello, my friend, hello
Just called to let you know
I think about you every night
When I'm here alone
And you're there at home
Hello
Maybe it's been crazy
Maybe I'm to blame
But I put my heart above my head
We've been through it all and you love me just the same
When you're not there
I just need to hear
Hello, my friend, hello
It's good to need you so
It's good to love you like I do
And to feel this way
When I hear you say
Hello"b"On the first day of January 1892
They opened Ellis Island and they let the people through
And the first to cross the threshold of that isle of hope and tears
Was Annie Moore from Ireland who was all of 15 years
Isle of hope, isle of tears
Isle of freedom, isle of fears
But it's not the isle you left behind
That isle of hunger, isle of pain
Isle you'll never see again
But the isle of home is always on your mind
In a little bag, she carried all her past and history
And her dreams for the future in the land of liberty
And courage is the passport when your old world disappears
But there's no future in the past when you're 15 years
Isle of hope, isle of tears
Isle of freedom, isle of fears
But it's not the isle you left behind
That isle of hunger, isle of pain
Isle you'll never see again
But the isle of home is always on your mind
When they closed down Ellis Island in 1943
17 million people had come there for sanctuary
And in springtime when I came here and I stepped onto its piers
I thought of how it must have been when you're 15 years
Isle of hope, isle of tears
Isle of freedom, isle of fears
But it's not the isle you left behind
That isle of hunger, isle of pain
Isle you'll never see again
But the isle of home is always on your mind
But the isle of home is always on your mind"b"Last night I dreamed you were back again
Larger than life again, holding me tight again
Placing those same kisses on my brow
Sweeter than ever now; Lord, I remember how
Couldn't get enough of kissing; do you know how much you're missing
No, you don't, but I do
The days like a slow train trickle by
And even the words that I write refuse to fly
All I can hear is your song haunting me
Can't get the melody out of my head, you see
Distractions are amusing; do you know how much you're losing
No, you don't, but I do
But I do, and I wonder if I'm past the point of rescue
Is no word from you at all the best that you can do
I never meant to push or shove you; do you know how much I love you
No, you don't, but I do
I never meant to push or shove you; do you know how much I love you
No, you don't, but I do
I swore I'd never fall like this again
Fools like me never win; I came to my knees again
I can't close the door on likelihood
Things might be just as good; always knew they would
Gotta let your love invite me; girl, do you think it might be just as good
No, you don't, but I do
Oh, but I do, and I wonder if I'm past the point of rescue
Is no word from you at all the best that you can do
I never meant to push or shove you; do you know how much I love you
No, you don't, but I do
I do
I do
I do"b'My child arrived just the other day
Came into the world in the usual way
But there were planes to catch and bills to pay
He learned to walk while I was away
And he was talkin\' \'fore I knew it, and as he grew
He\'d say "I\'m gonna be like you, Dad
You know I\'m gonna be like you."
Well, the cat\'s in the cradle and the silver spoon
Little Boy Blue and the Man in the Moon
"When you comin\' home, Dad?"
"I don\'t know when, but we\'ll get together then, son
You know we\'ll have a good time then."
My son turned ten just the other day
He said, "Thanks for the ball, Dad, come on, let\'s play
Can you teach me to throw?" I said, "Not today
I got a lot to do", he said, "That\'s ok."
And he walked away but his smile never dimmed
And said, "I\'m gonna be like him, yeah.
You know I\'m gonna be like him."
And the cat\'s in the cradle and the silver spoon
Little Boy Blue and the Man in the Moon
"When you comin\' home, Dad?"
"I don\'t know when, but we\'ll get together then, son
You know we\'ll have a good time then."
Well, he came from college just the other day
So much like a man I just had to say
"Son, I\'m proud of you. Can you sit for a while?"
He shook his head and said with a smile,
"What I\'d really like, Dad, is to borrow the car keys
See you later. Can I have them please?"
Well, the cat\'s in the cradle and the silver spoon
Little Boy Blue and the Man in the Moon
"When you comin\' home, son?"
"I don\'t know when, but we\'ll get together then, Dad
You know we\'ll have a good time then."
Well, I\'ve long since retired; my son\'s moved away
I called him up just the other day
I said, "I\'d like to see you if you don\'t mind."
He said, "I\'d love to, Dad, if I can find the time.
You see, my new job\'s a hassle and the kids have the flu
But it\'s sure nice talking to you, Dad.
It\'s been sure nice talking to you."
And as I hung up the phone it occurred to me
He\'d grown up just like me
My boy was just like me
Well, the cat\'s in the cradle and the silver spoon
Little Boy Blue and the Man on the Moon
"When you comin\' home, son?"
"I don\'t know when, but we\'ll get together then, Dad
You know we\'ll have a good time then."'b"Leaving sweet lovely Derry for fair London town
There is no finer harbor all around can be found
Where the youngsters, each evening, go down to the shore
And the joy bells are ringing for the maid of Culmore
The first time I saw her, she passed me by
And the next time I saw her, she bid me goodbye
But the last time I saw her, it grieved my heart sore
For she sailed down Loch Foyle and away from Culmore
If I had the power: the storms for to rise
I would make the wind blow out and I'd darken the skies
I'd make the wind blow high and the salt seas to roar
'Til the day that my darling sailed away from Culmore
To the back parts of America, my love, I'll go seek
For it's there I know no one and no one knows me
But if I don't find her, I'll return home no more
Like a pilgrim I'll wander for the maid of Culmore"b'Molly, dear, now did you hear
The news thats goin round?
Down in a corner of my heart,
A love is what youve found.

You seem to whisper in my ear,

I saw a horse outside the door where my old horse should be
Well, I called me wife and I said to her: "Will you kindly tell to me

"Ah, you\'re drunk

And all the time we spend apart that ticking tock clock seems to last for weeks.
Well I guess it is quite long to expect you to climb up here each week,
Yes I guess it aint so long four hours on a bus for yous a treat.
And it wont be long x2
All day long I sit here, x 3
Thinkin bout you.
Yes I know theres a million miles and aeroplanes, they keep us apart,
But when I sit alone at night on my bus darling well your in my heart.
And it wont be long x2
So complicated times have passed, but am sorry babe I feel the same for you.
Yes I know I broke it off but am sorry babe ya just didnt stay true.
And it wont be long x2
All day long I sit here, thinkin bout you.'b"Well, it's a marvelous night for a moondance
With the stars up above in your eyes
A fantabulous night to make romance
'Neath the cover of October skies
And all the leaves on the trees are fallin'
To the sound of the breezes that blow
An' I'm trying to please to the callin'
Of your heartstrings that play soft and low

Can I just make some more romance with you, my love?
Well, I wanna make love to you tonight
I can't wait 'til the morning has come
And I know now the time is just right
And straight into my arms you will run
And when you come, my heart will be waiting
To make sure that you're never alone
There and then, all my dreams will come true, dear
There and then, I will make you my own
And every time I touch you, you just tremble inside
And I know how much you want me that you can't hide

With the golden hair
Yet eyes that show the emptiness inside
Do we know
Can we understand just how he feels
Or have we really tried
See him now
As he stands alone
And watches children play a children's game
Simple child
He looks almost like the others
Yet they know he's not the same
Scorn not his simplicity
But rather try to love him all the more
Scorn not his simplicity
Oh no
Oh no
See him stare
Not recognizing the kind face
That only yesterday he loved
The loving face
Of a mother who can't understand
what she's been guilty of
How she cried, tears of happiness
the day the doctor told her it's a boy
Now she cries tears of helplessness
and thinks of all the things he can't enjoy
Scorn not his simplicity
But rather try to love him all the more
Scorn not his simplicity
Oh no
Oh no
Only he knows how to face the future hopefully
Surrounded by despair
He won't ask for your pity or your sympathy
But surely you should care
Scorn not his simplicity
But rather try to love him all the more
Scorn not his simplicity
Oh no
Oh no
Oh no"b"Side by side

One for all and all together
We will stay united through darker days

And to meet our destiny with glory

Vowing never to be broken

Old men go fishin with black line and spoons.
And, if they catch nothin, they never complain;
I wish I was with them again
2. As boys in their boats call to girls on the shore,
Teasin the ones that they dearly adore.
And, into the evning, the courting begins;
I wish I was with them again.
Chorus:
Can you imagine a piece of the universe
More fit for princes and kings?
Ill trade you ten of your cities for Marion Bridge
And the pleasure it brings.
3. Out on the Mira on soft summer nights,
Bon fires blaze to the childrens delight.
They dance round the flames, singin songs with their friends;
I wish I was with them again.
4. And over the ashes the stories are told
Of witches and werewolves and Oak Island gold.
Stars on the river-face sparkle and spin;
I wish I was with them again. (Chorus)
5. Out on the Mira the people are kind;
They treat you to homebrew and help you unwind.
And, if you come broken, theyll see that you mend;
I wish I was with them again.
6. Now Ill conclude with a wish you go well:
Sweet be your dreamsand your happiness swell.
Ill leave you here, for my journey begins;
Im going to be with them again,
Im going to be with them again.'b'Blame it all on my roots
I showed up in boots
And ruined your black tie affair
The last one to know
The last one to show
I was the last one
You thought you\'d see there
And I saw the surprise
And the fear in his eyes
When I took his glass of champagne
And I toasted you
Said, "Honey, we may be through
But you\'ll never hear me complain"
\'Cause I\'ve got friends in low places
Where the whiskey drowns
And the beer chases my blues away
And I\'ll be okay
I\'m not big on social graces
Think I\'ll slip on down to the oasis
\'Cause I\'ve got friends in low places
Well, I guess I was wrong
I just don\'t belong
But then, I\'ve been there before
Everything\'s all right
And I\'ll just say good night
And I\'ll show myself to the door
Hey, I didn\'t mean
To cause a big scene
Just give me an hour and then
Well, I\'ll be as high
As that ivory tower
That you\'re livin\' in
\'Cause I\'ve got friends in low places
Where the whiskey drowns
And the beer chases my blues away
And I\'ll be okay
I\'m not big on social graces
Think I\'ll slip on down to the oasis
\'Cause I\'ve got friends in low places
Yeah, I\'ve got friends in low places
Where the whiskey drowns
And the beer chases my blues away
And I\'ll be okay

Think I\'ll slip on down to the oasis
\'Cause I\'ve got friends in low places
\'Cause I\'ve got friends in low places

And the beer chases my blues away
And I\'ll be okay

This is the day
When I send all my doubts and demons
On their way
Every endeavor
I have made-ever
Is coming into play
Is here and now-today
This is the moment
This is the time
When the momentum and the moment
Are in rhyme
Give me this moment
This precious chance
I'll gather up my past
And make some sense at last
This is the moment
When all I've done
All of the dreaming
Scheming and screaming
Become one
This is the day
See it sparkle and shine
When all I've lived for
Becomes mine
For all of these years
I've faced the world alone
And now the time has come
To prove to them
I've made it on my own
This is the moment
My final test
Destiny beckoned
I never reckoned
Second best
I won't look down
I must not fall
This is the moment
The sweetest moment of them all
This is the moment
Damn all the odds
This day or never
I'll sit forever
With the gods
When I look back
I will always recall
Moment for moment
This was the moment
The greatest moment
Of them all"b"I don't know you
But I want you
All the more for that
Words fall through me
And always fool me
And I can't react
And games that never amount
To more than they're meant
Will play themselves out
Take this sinking boat and point it home
We've still got time
Raise your hopeful voice; you have a choice
You'll make it now
Falling slowly, eyes that know me
And I can't go back
Moods that take me and erase me
And I'm painted black
Well, you have suffered enough
And warred with yourself
It's time that you won
Take this sinking boat and point it home
We've still got time
Raise your hopeful voice; you have a choice
You've made it now"b'She can kill with a smile
She can wound with her eyes
She can ruin your faith with her casual lies
And she only reveals what she wants you to see
She hides like a child,
But shes always a woman to me
She can lead you to love
She can take you or leave you
She can ask for the truth
But shell never believe you
And shell take what you give her, as long as its free
Yeah, she steals like a thief
But shes always a woman to me
Oh, she takes care of herself
She can wait if she wants
Shes ahead of her time
Oh, and she never gives out
And she never gives in
She just changes her mind
And shell promise you more
Than the Garden of Eden
Then shell carelessly cut you
And laugh while youre bleedin
But shell bring out the best
And the worst you can be
Blame it all on yourself
Cause shes always a woman to me
Oh, she takes care of herself
She can wait if she wants
Shes ahead of her time
Oh, and she never gives out
And she never gives in
She just changes her mind
She is frequently kind
And shes suddenly cruel
She can do as she pleases
Shes nobodys fool
But she cant be convicted
Shes earned her degree
And the most she will do
Is throw shadows at you
But shes always a woman to me'b"Who can say for certain
Maybe you're still here
I feel you all around me
Your memory's so clear
Deep in the stillness
I can hear you speak
You're still an inspiration
Can it be
That you are mine
Forever love
And you are watching over me from up above
Fly me up to where you are
Beyond the distant star
I wish upon tonight
To see you smile
If only for awhile to know you're there
A breath away's not far
To where you are
Are you gently sleeping
Here inside my dream
And isn't faith believing
All power can't be seen
As my heart holds you
Just one beat away
I cherish all you gave me everyday
'Cause you are my
Forever love
Watching me from up above
And I believe
That angels breathe
And that love will live on and never leave
Fly me up
To where you are
Beyond the distant star
I wish upon tonight
To see you smile
If only for awhile
To know you're there
A breath away's not far
To where you are

Way up high
Theres a land that Ive heard of
Once in a lullaby
Somewhere over the rainbow
Skies are blue
And the dreams that you dare to dream
Really do come true
Someday Ill wish upon a star
And wake up where the clouds are far behind me
Where troubles melt like lemon drops
Away above the chimney tops
Thats where youll find me
Somewhere over the rainbow
Bluebirds fly
Birds fly over the rainbow
Why then, oh, why cant I?'b'I\'m lying alone with my head on the phone
Thinking of you \'til it hurts
I know you\'re hurt, too, but what else can we do?
Tormented and torn apart
I wish I could carry your smile in my heart
For times when my life seems so low
It would make me believe what tomorrow would bring
When today doesn\'t really know, doesn\'t really know
I\'m all out of love, I\'m so lost without you
I know you were right believing for so long
I\'m all out of love, what am I without you
I can\'t be too late to say, "I was so wrong"
I want you to come back and carry me home
Away from these long lonely nights
I\'m reaching for you; are you feeling it, too?
Does the feeling seem oh, so right?
And what would you say if I called on you now
And said that I can\'t hold on?
There\'s no easy way, it gets harder each day
Please love me or I\'ll be gone
I\'ll be gone
I\'m all out of love, I\'m so lost without you
I know you were right believing for so long
I\'m all out of love, what am I without you

Champagne, a gentle song, a slow dance
Who makes it fun to spend your money?
Who calls you honey most every day?
Girls, girls, girls
Girls, girls, girls
Well, they made em up in Hollywood
And put em into the movies

Theyre still romantic in their own way

Step on, the world keeps swinging
Put on the dazzling charm
Get up and find those pretty girls!
Dont rush, keep it nice and gentle
And sentimental for that certain moment
Moonlit oceans, girls full of emotions
Stepping on that slow boat to China
And next door in Japan, they know how to please a man
Calling in for tea with my geisha
Theyve got that old-fashioned feeling
When it comes to pleasing, they know their way

Who say that I'm a dreamer
And I've no doubt
There's truth in what they say
But sure a body is bound to be a dreamer
When all the things he loves are far away
And precious things
Are dreams unto an exile
They take him o'er
The land across the sea
Especially when it happens he's an exile
From that dear lovely Isle of Innisfree
And when the moonlight
Peeps across the rooftops
Of this great city
Wondrous though it be
I scarcely feel its wonder or its laughter
I'm once again back home in Innisfree
I wander o'e r green hills
Through dreamy valleys
And find a peace
No other land could know
I hear the birds make music fit for angels
And watch the rivers laughing as they flow
And then into a humble shack I wander
My dear old home
And tenderly behold
The folks I love
Around the turf fire gathered
On bended knee
Their rosary is told
But dreams don't last
Though dreams are not forgotten
And soon I'm back
To stern reality
But though they pave
The footways here with gold dust
I still would choose
The Isle of Innisfree
I still would choose
The Isle of Innisfree"b"In a neat little town they call Belfast
Apprentice to trade I was bound
And many an hour sweet happiness
I spent in that neat little town
Till a sad misfortune came over me
Which caused me to stray from this land
Far away from me friends and relations
Betrayed by the black velvet band
I took a stroll with that pretty fair maid
When a gentleman passes me by
I knew that she had the doing in him
By that look in her rovish black eye
A gold watch she took from his pocket
And placed it right into my hand
The very next thing I said was
Bad luck to the black velvet band
Her eyes they shown like diamonds
I thought her the queen of the land
And her hair hung over her shoulder
Tied up with a black velvet band
Before the judge and the jury
Next morning I had to appear
The judge he said to me
Young lad, your case it is proven clear
We'll go seven years penal servitude
And take you away from this land
Far away from me friends and relations
Betrayed by the black velvet band
Her eyes they shown like diamonds
I thought her the queen of the land
And her hair hung over her shoulder
Tied up with a black velvet band
So come all ye jolly young fellas
Who warning, take by me
When you are out in the town, me lads
Be aware of them pretty colleens
For they'll feed you with strong drink me lads
Till you are unable to stand
And the very next thing you know is that
You've landed in Van Diemen's land
Her eyes they shown like diamonds
I thought her the queen of the land
And her hair hung over her shoulder
Tied up with a black velvet band
Her eyes they shown like diamonds
I thought her the queen of the land
And her hair hung over her shoulder
Tied up with a black velvet band"b'As I went home on Monday night as drunk as drunk could be

When I was a silly boy
I didn't need a thing,

You wandered in and now I'm caught
I never thought I would see
Someone so truly good
Some one who's so everything I'm not
I want to spend my life with you
Don't want to live all alone
I can't conceive of the years left in me
Without you in our home
But what if, what if, what if what
If it's not perfect then it's not
With every care I'll take
One thing I won't forsake
To dwell beside what you've got
Every time I think about you
I think I can't live without you
I'll tell you something
I am nothing without you
I want to spend my life with you
I don't want to live all alone

My Lagan love
Where Lagan stream sing lullaby
There blows a lily fair
The twilight gleam is in her eyes
The night is on her hair
And like a lovesick lenanshee
She hath my heart in thrall
No life I own, no liberty
For love is lord of all
My Lagan love
And sometimes when the beetle horn
Hath lulled the eve to sleep
I steal unto her shieling low
And through the dooreen peep
There on the cricket's singing stone
She stirs the bogwood fire
And hums in soft sweet undertones
The song of heart's desire
The song of heart's desire"b"Look out! There's danger all about,

Where dwelt an fairest colleen, who charmed the hearts of men,
She was winsome hale and hearty, shy and graceful as the dawn,
Neighbours loved that widow's daughter, happy laughing Noreen Bawn.
Till one day there came a letter, with her passage paid to go,
To the land where the Missouri, and the Mississippi flows,
Then she said goodbye to Ireland, and next morning at the door,
That old mother broken hearted, bid farewell to Noreen Bawn.
Many years that mother waited,till one evening at the door,
Stood a gorgeous looking lady, costly were the clothes she wore,
Saying mother dont you know me, for I've only got a cold,
But thoes purple spots upon her cheeks, the tragic story's told."b"They come from the farms and the factories too
And they all soon forget who they are.
The cares of today are soon washed away
As they sit at a stool by the bar.
The girl with green eyes in the Rolling Stones shirt
Doesn't look like she works on the land.
The man at the end, he's a very good friend
Of a man who sells cars second hand.
[Chorus]
Down at the Red Rose Cafe in the Harbour
There by the port just outside Amsterdam.
Everyone shares in the songs and the laughter.
Everyone there is so happy to be there.
The salesmen relax with a few pints of beer
As they try not to speak about trade.
The poet won't write any verses tonight.
He may sing a sweet serenade.
So pull up a chair and forget about life.
It's a good thing to do now and then
And if you like it here I have an idea
Tomorrow let's all meet again."b"She is young, and oh! So pretty,
With a twinkle in her eyes
And just the kind of features
To make a young man sigh.
She is sweet and she is sunny,
Just like a morn in May,
She's just the kind of creature
Who could steal your heart away
But
She's not the one that's meant for me,
The one that Heaven-sent for me.
I know, although I haven't found her yet,
She's not the one, she's not the one
She's not the one that I'll care for,
The one I'll always be there for.
Don't ask the why or the wherefore
I know
She's not the one, she's not the one
Can her smile light up the morning?
Can her laughter lift the night?
Can she hold you when you're troubled,
And make everything alright?
Can she fill each waking moment?
Who knows? Perhaps she can,
And yes, I realize
She'd be a prize for any man
But
She's not the one that's meant for me,
The one that Heaven-sent for me.
I know, although I haven't found her yet,
She's not the one, she's not the one
She's not the one that I'll care for,
The one I'll always be there for.
Don't ask the why or the wherefore
I know
She's not the one,
she's not the one."b"In my time I've been a few places,

That I'm still the boss around here.
I still call every shot,
And I'll tell you what's what,
And what's not, do I make myself clear.
I'm not ready to roll over
I'm still, the daddy of the all,
I'm still the top banana,
They still answer when I call.
I'm older, yes, but I'm wiser,
And they better not forget,
I'm not ready to roll over
'Cause there's life in the old dog yet.
You can't put an old head on young shoulders
My advice is the best I can give
Let them make their mistakes;
Let them fight for their rights;
Let them learn how to love and to live.
I've only got the one daughter,
Time she married a man of her own,
And the one I have planned
Has got plenty of land,
She'll be grand, and I'll stand all alone.
I'm not ready to roll over
I'm still, the daddy of the all,
I'm still the top banana,
They still answer when I call.
I'm older, yes, but I'm wiser,
And they better not forget,
I'm not ready to roll over
'Cause there's life in the old dog yet.
I'm not ready to roll over
I'm still, the daddy of the all,
I'm still the top banana,
They still answer when I call.
I'm older, yes, but I'm wiser,
And they better not forget,
I'm not ready to roll over
'Cause there's life in the old dog yet.
'Cause there's life in this old dog yet."b"Buachaill o'n Eirne me 's bhreagfainn calin deas og

Come by the hills to the land where fancy is free
And stand where the peaks meet the sky and the lochs meet the sea
Where the rivers run clear and the bracken is gold in the sun
And the cares of tomorrow can wait 'til this day is done
Come by the hills to the land where life is a song
And stand where the birds fill the air with their joy all day long
Where the trees sway in time and even the wind sings in tune
And the cares of tomorrow can wait 'til this day is done
Come by the hills to the land where legends remain
And the stories of old fill the heart and may yet come again
Where the past has been lost and the future is still to be won
And the cares of tomorrow can wait 'til this day is done"b"[Chorus]
Home, home, home from the sea
Angels of mercy, answer our plea
And carry us home, home, home from the[ sea
Carry us safely home from the sea.
On a cold winters night
With a storm at its height
The lifeboat answered the call.
They pitched and they tossed
Till we thought they were lost
As we watched from the harbor wall.
Though the night was pitch black,
There was no turning back,
For someone was waiting out there,
But each volunteer
Had to live with his fear
As they joined in a silent prayer.
[Chorus]
As they battled their way
Past the mouth of the bay,
It was blowing like never before.
As they gallantly fought,
Every one of them thought
Of loved ones back on the shore.
Then a flicker of light
And they knew they were right.
There she was on the crest of a wave.
She's an old fishing boat
And she's barely afloat.
Please God, there are souls we can save.
[Chorus]
And back in the town
In a street that runs down
To the sea and the harbor wall,
They'd gathered in pairs
At the foot of the stairs
To wait or the radio call.
And just before dawn
When all hope had gone
Came a hush and a faraway sound.
'Twas the coxswain he roared
All survivors on board
Thank God and we're homeward bound.
[Chorus]"b'As I\'m sitting here in the firelight
And turning back the years
I can hear my mother singing in the morning
As she scrubbed our shining faces
And then packed us off to school
All too soon those days were over without warning
Sing me the songs of our gold and silver days
Days filled with innocence and light
Not a penny to our name
We were happy just the same
In our gold and silver days
In the parlor on a Friday night
My father took the floor
I can hear us join together in the chorus
Singing "Just a Song at Twilight"
Or "The Moon Behind the Hill"
Now those voices are all silenced, gone before us
Sing me the songs of our gold and silver days
Days filled with innocence and light
Not a penny to our name
We were happy just the same
In our gold and silver days
And we gathered at the Daisy Field
On Sunday after mass
I can hear the songs, the story\'s and the laughter
Through the years we all were scattered
But the friends we made back then
Were the friends we could rely on ever after
So sing me the songs of our gold and silver days
Days filled with innocence and light
Not a penny to our name
We were happy just the same
In those gold and silver days'b"Black is the color of my true love`s hair
Her lips are like some roses fair
She`s got the sweetest smile and the gentlest hands.
I love the ground whereon she stands
I love my love and well she knows
I love the ground whereon she goes.
But I wish the day soon will come
When she and I could be as one
Black is the color of my true love`s hair
Her lips are like some roses fair
She`s got the sweetest smile and the gentlest hands.
I love the ground whereon she stands
I go to the Clyde and I mourn and weep
But satisfied I never can sleep
I'll write her a letter, just a few short lines
And suffer death a thousand times"b"Thank you, Lord, for a new day dawning

But I like it this way.

I'm on the outside lookin' in,
But I don't really care.
Here in the outside lookin' in,
'Long as I get my share.
You know that I'll take my share
When it's late at night,
They blow out the light,
And although they might be sleein'.
If they hear a sound,
I may be around,
And they know I could be creepin', (creepin' creepin')
They must be aware,
If they think I'm there, it's a very scary feelin'!
Lyin' in their beds,
Running through their heads,
Is one thought-what is he stealin'?

I'm a hound of hell,
As they get the smell of danger.
As I'm coming near
I can taste their fear
Of the dark and deadly stranger.
They know who I am
I don't give a damn,
I could lead ev'ry lamb to the slaughter.
So be on your guard
For my calling card,
And be sure, to lock up your daughters.
They keep us outside lookin' in,
My sister and me.
And if we're outside lookin' in,
That's the way it will be.

The love that I've been searching for,

When you hold me tight,
Tender is the night.
After all this time,
After all the loneliness,
Yearning for your touch,
Yearning for your tenderness.
Now at last I've found
The magic of your sweet caress,
And ev'rything feels right,
When you hold me tight,
Tender is the night.
You have mad my spirit whole,
And you have touched my very soul

Opened ev'ry door,
Made me cry for more..

And in the Power above
To make our ev'ry dream come true.

Will love until eternity,

Who breaks ev'ry rule?
The Hightwayman.
He isn't a rogue, and he isn't a fool.

He is dashing and daring
The devil may care

With a glint in his eye,
And the wind in his hair
The Highwayman.
Who is the Highwayman?
Who is the Highwayman?
He's rough, but he's handsome,
He's gentle but strong,

How hard he will be to forget.

He's stolen form Earls,

Is stealing from girls,

And I have had my wild romances
I've taken all that life can give
And taken my fair share of chances
It's been a good life
Far from the high life
And I thank God that this is my life
I've known just how it is to win
And I have felt the pain of losing
Some paths I chose would end in tears
But they were all of my own choosing
It's been a good life
Far from the high life
And I thank God that this is my life
I've known contentment
In a woman's arms
And felt the warmth of her devotion
And I've known heartache
And a dark despair
That was as deep as any ocean
But, we get the strength to carry on
And build a life of our own making
We thank the Lord for each new day
And for every breath that we are taking
It's a good life
Far from the high life
And I thank God that this was my life
I've known contentment
In a woman's arms
And felt the warmth of her devotion
And I've known heartache
And a dark despair
That was as deep as any ocean
And looking back on all the years
The loves, the sweetness, and the sorrow
Have made me what I am today
And I'd do it all again tomorrow
It's been a good life
Far from the high life
And I thank God that this was my life
We can't deny life
How it flies by, life
And I thank God that this was my life"b"The Dutchman's not the kind of man
Who keeps his thumb jammed in the dam
That holds his dreams in,
But that's a secret that only Margaret knows.
When Amsterdam is golden in the summer,
Margaret brings him breakfast,
She believes him.
He thinks the tulips bloom beneath the snow.
He's mad as he can be, but Margaret only sees that sometimes,
Sometimes she sees her unborn children in his eyes.
Let us go to the banks of the ocean
Where the walls rise above the Zuider Zee.
Long ago, I used to be a young man
And dear Margaret remembers that for me.
The Dutchman still wears wooden shoes,
His cap and coat are patched with the love
That Margaret sewed there.
Sometimes he thinks he's still in Rotterdam.
And he watches the tug-boats down canals
An' calls out to them when he thinks he knows the Captain.
Till Margaret comes
To take him home again
Through unforgiving streets that trip him, though she holds his arm,
Sometimes he thinks he's alone and he calls her name.
Let us go to the banks of the ocean
Where the walls rise above the Zuiderzee.
Long ago, I used to be a young man
And dear Margaret remembers that for me.
The winters whirl the windmills 'round
She winds his muffler tighter
And they sit in the kitchen.
Some tea with whiskey keeps away the dew.
And he sees her for a moment, calls her name,
She makes the bed up singing some old love song,
A song Margaret learned
When it was very new.
He hums a line or two, they sing together in the dark.
The Dutchman falls asleep and Margaret blows the candle out.
Let us go to the banks of the ocean
Where the walls rise above the Zuiderzee.
Long ago, I used to be a young man
And dear Margaret remembers that for me."b'When you are eighteen,
You\'re a man who is ready,
Who is strong and who\'s steady,
You know what I mean?
When you are eighteen,
Then you should be respected,
And you don\'t need protected,

When you are eighteen,
You are braver and bolder
Than that crowd who are older,
You know who I mean?
\'Cos when you are eighteen,
With all those years to prepare you,
There\'s nothing can scare you,
When you are eighteen.

To follow my star
To the places I\'ve been dreaming of.

I\'m ready for life

And so over-rated",
You know what I mean?
When you are eighteen,
They say "Wait, and don\'t worry",
And "Hey! What\'s your hurry
\'Cos you\'re only eighteen".
I\'m ready to travel,
To follow my star
To the places I\'ve been dreaming of.
I\'m ready for living;
I\'m ready for life
And I know that I\'m ready for love
When you are eighteen,
With the world all around you,
It can sometimes astound you,
You know what I mean?
Just how little they know, ha,
All those cowboys and chancers,
I\'ve got more of the answers.
And I\'m only eighteen.'b"Once in the dear dead days beyond recall,
When on the world the mists began to fall,
Out of the dreams that rose in happy throng
Low to our hearts Love sang an old sweet song;
And in the dusk where fell the firelight gleam,
Softly it wove itself into our dream.
Just a song a twilight, when the lights are low,
And the flickering shadows softly come and go,
Tho' the heart be weary, sad the day and long,
Still to us at twilight comes Love's old song,
Comes Love's old sweet song.
Even today we hear Love's song of yore,
Deep in our hearts it dwells forevermore.
Footsteps may falter, weary grow the way,
Still we can hear it at the close of day.
So till the end, when life's dim shadows fall,
Love will be found the sweetest song of all."b"All God's creatures got a place in the choir
Some sing low and some sing higher,
Some sing out loud on a telephone wire,
Some just clap their hands, or paws, or anything they've got now
All God's creatures got a place in the choir
Some sing low and some sing higher,
Some sing out loud on a telephone wire,
Some just clap their hands, or paws, or anything they've got now
Listen to the top where the little bird sings
On the melodies and the high notes ringing,
And the hoot owl cries over everything
And the blackbird disagrees
Singing in the night time, singing in the day,
When little duck quacks, and he's on his way
And the otter hasn't got much to say
And the porcupine talks to himself
All God's creatures got a place in the choir
Some sing low and some sing higher,
Some sing out loud on a telephone wire,
Some just clap their hands, or paws, or anything they've got now
The dogs and the cats they take up the middle
While the honeybee hums and the cricket fiddles,
The donkey brays and the pony neighs
And the old gray badger sighs
Listen to the bass, it's the one on the bottom
Where the bullfrog croaks and the hippopotamus
Moans and groans with a big t'do
And the old cow just goes moo
All God's creatures got a place in the choir
Some sing low and some sing higher,
Some sing out loud on a telephone wire,
Some just clap their hands, or paws, or anything they've got now
It's a simple song a little song everywhere
By the ox and the fox and the grizzly bear,
The dopey alligator and the the hawk above,
The sly old weasel and the turtle dove
All God's creatures got a place in the choir
Some sing low and some sing higher,
Some sing out loud on a telephone wire,
Some just clap their hands, or paws, or anything they've got now
All God's creatures got a place in the choir
Some sing low and some sing higher,
Some sing out loud on a telephone wire,

I met with captain Farrell and his money he was counting
I first produced my pistol and I then produced my rapier
Saying "Stand and deliver" for he were a bold deceiver
[Chorus]
Mush-a ring dum-a do dum-a da
Whack for my daddy-o. Whack for my daddy-o
There\'s whiskey in the jar
I counted out his money and it made a pretty penny
I put it in me pocket and I took it home to Jenny
She sighed and she swore that she never would deceive me
But the devil take the women for they never can be easy
[Chorus]
I went up to my chamber, all for to take a slumber
I dreamt of gold and jewels and for sure \'t was no wonder
But Jenny drew me charges and she filled them up with water
Then sent for captain Farrell to be ready for the slaughter
[Chorus]
\'t was early in the morning, just before I rose to travel
Up comes a band of footmen and likewise captain Farrell
I first produced me pistol for she stole away me rapier
I couldn\'t shoot the water, so a prisoner I was taken
[Chorus]
Now there\'s some take delight in the carriages a rolling
and others take delight in the hurling and the bowling
but I take delight in the juice of the barley
and courting pretty fair maids in the morning bright and early
[Chorus]
If anyone can aid me \'t is my brother in the army
If I can find his station in Cork or in Killarney
And if he\'ll go with me, we\'ll go rovin\' through Killkenny
And I\'m sure he\'ll treat me better than my own a-sporting Jenny

An Ave for my mother as her spirit slips away
Away to join my father and to share eternity
We call them kindred spirits now they will forever be
So now they're reunited, smiling down from up above
As fondly we remember the old house they filled with love
How even through the hard times they were close as close could be
Just like the kindred spirits they will forever be
Now love was as deep as the ocean
Flying higher than the eagles would dare
As strong as the mountains in Donegal
As soft as a morning in Clair
I can see her in the kitchen. I can smell the baking bread
I can hear my father singing as he tucked us into bed.
They shared the love together, they were proud as proud could be
And now those kindred spirits will share eternity."b"Well, I took a stroll on the old long walk
Of a day -I-ay-I-ay
I met a little girl and we stopped to talk
Of a fine soft day -I-ay-I-ay
And I ask you, friend, what's a fella to do
'Cause her hair was black and her eyes were blue
And I knew right then I'd be takin' a whirl
'Round the Salthill Prom with a Galway girl
We were halfway there when the rain came down
Of a day -I-ay-I-ay
And she asked me up to her flat downtown
Of a fine soft day -I-ay-I-ay
And I ask you, friend, what's a fella to do
'Cause her hair was black and her eyes were blue
So I took her hand and I gave her a twirl
And I lost my heart to a Galway girl
When I woke up I was all alone
With a broken heart and a ticket home
And I ask you now, tell me what would you do
If her hair was black and her eyes were blue
I've traveled around I've been all over this world
Boys I ain't never seen nothin' like a Galway girl"b'Damian:

The campfire glows in the autumn breeze, and I am

Remember me, recuerde me. Mi amore.
So long ago, so far away, each night I pray
"volvero los dias passados"
I promise you that come what may
those days will stay ever in my memory
In all this world I could never find, the love that I had to leave behind.
But duty calls, so whate\'er befalls
Remember me, recuerde me, mi amor.'b"My young love said to me, 'My mother won't mind,

'It will not be long, love, till our wedding day.'
She went away from me and she moved through the fair,
And slowly I watched her move here and move there,
She went his way homeward with one star awake,
As the swan in the evening moves over the lake.
The people were saying no two were e'er wed
But one has a sorrow that never was said,
And I smiled as she passed with her goods and her gear,
And that was the last that I saw of my dear.
I dreamt last night that my young love came in,
She came in so sweetly, her feet made no din;
She stepped up beside me, and this she did say,
'It will not be long love, till our wedding day."b'Anol shalom

Your mountains stand tall in their glory:
Your rivers run free - the bright stars are your eyes,
Your beauty is endless before me.
Oh, you are the song ever singing in me,
And you are the heart ever true:
For, you are my land and you always will be,
The voice ever calling me... home to you.
When times we are far from your forests and streams,
When sailing from your shining waters:
We carry your hopes - your spirit, your dreams-
In the hearts of your sons and your daughters.
When to your green valleys some day I return,
When you lay your mantle around me:
At rest I will be where the heart will not yearn,
With my land to ever...surround me.

I met with captain Farrell and his money he was counting
I first produced my pistol and I then produced my rapier
Saying "Stand and deliver" for he were a bold deceiver
[Chorus]
Mush-a ring dum-a do dum-a da
Whack for my daddy-o. Whack for my daddy-o
There\'s whiskey in the jar
I counted out his money and it made a pretty penny
I put it in me pocket and I took it home to Jenny
She sighed and she swore that she never would deceive me
But the devil take the women for they never can be easy
[Chorus]
I went up to my chamber, all for to take a slumber
I dreamt of gold and jewels and for sure \'t was no wonder
But Jenny drew me charges and she filled them up with water
Then sent for captain Farrell to be ready for the slaughter
[Chorus]
\'t was early in the morning, just before I rose to travel
Up comes a band of footmen and likewise captain Farrell
I first produced me pistol for she stole away me rapier
I couldn\'t shoot the water, so a prisoner I was taken
[Chorus]
Now there\'s some take delight in the carriages a rolling
and others take delight in the hurling and the bowling
but I take delight in the juice of the barley
and courting pretty fair maids in the morning bright and early
[Chorus]
If anyone can aid me \'t is my brother in the army
If I can find his station in Cork or in Killarney
And if he\'ll go with me, we\'ll go rovin\' through Killkenny
And I\'m sure he\'ll treat me better than my own a-sporting Jenny
[Chorus]'b"Tumbling curls of green by the stainedglass streaming light
And a yellow coloured lampshade used to keep us up all night
The smile upon your face, the tears upon your cheek
And the night sky on the window
Your heart calling out to me.
Come running home again, Katie
Come running home again
Cross my heart and hope to die
Shall I cause another tear from your eye
The mirror that won't talk and your nightgown on the door
And the old pedal Singer just don't sing no more
You can roll the reels for hours
From the movie of this book
It's a question mark on this heart of mine
Sends an elder back to look.
Come running home again, Katie
Come running home again
Cross my heart and hope to die
Shall I cause another tear from your eye"b"I've met some folks who say that I'm a dreamer
And I've no doubt there's truth in what they say
But sure a body's bound to be a dreamer
When all the things he loves are far away
And precious things are dreams unto an exile
They take him o'er the land across the sea
Especially when it happens he's an exile
From that dear lovely Isle of Inisfree
And when the moonlight peeps across the rooftops
Of this great city, wondrous though it be
I scarcely feel its wonder or laughter
I'm once again back home in Inisfree
I wander o'er green hills, through dreamy valleys
And find a peace no other land could know
I hear the birds make music fit for angels
And watch the rivers laughing as they flow
And then into a humble shack I wander
My dear old home and tenderly behold
The folks I love around the turf fire gathered
On bended knee their rosary is told
But dreams don't last, though dreams are not forgotten
And soon I'm back to stern reality
But though they pave the footways here with gold dust
I still would choose the Isle of Inisfree
I still would choose the Isle of Inisfree"b"Black is the color of my true love's hair
Her lips are like some roses fair
She's the sweetest face and the gentlest hands.
I love the ground whereon she stands
I love my love and well she knows
I love the ground whereon she goes.
But some times I wish the day will come
That she and I will be as one
Black is the color of my true love's hair
Her lips are like some roses fair
She's the sweetest face and the gentlest hands.
I love the ground whereon she stands
I walk to the Clyde for to mourn and weep
But satisfied I never can sleep
I'll write her a letter, just a few short lines
And suffer death ten thousand times"b"So it goes history shows deserts must expand
Camels sail like wooden ships like women down The Strand
There's sand on Second Avenue and the wind blows like a train
Taxi's line-up like a strand of pearls around the block again
I remembered everything every windowpane
Every word came back to me the way it used to be
Then I saw your face across the street
Through the tears of Hercules
There's a bus that leaves at 8:15 and another one at 10:00
Should I climb aboardrisk everything-and ride it to the end?
Watch the hill like roller coasters up into the sky
And wish that you were here by me so close that I could die
You say love wrecks everything and none of us survive
But I got over you last night and I am still alive
'Til I saw your face across the street
Through the tears of Hercules"b"Voices are calling

Only for nights in Ballygran
I would swim over the deepest ocean
The deepest ocean for my love to find
But the sea is wide and I cannot swim over
And nor have I the wings to fly
If I could find me a lonesome boatman
To ferry me over my love and I
My childhood days bring back sad reflections
Of happy time I spent so long ago
My boyhood friends and my own relations
Have all passed on now like the melted snow
So I'll spend my days in endless roving
Soft is the grass my bed is free
Ah, to be home now in Carrickfergus
On that long road down to the sea
And in Kilkenny it is reported
On marble stone there as black as ink
With gold and silver I would support her
But I'll sing no more now till I get a drink
For I'm drunk today and I'm seldom sober
A handsome rover from town to town
Ah but I am sick now my days are numbered
Come all ye young men and lay me down"b'One, two, three four, five,
Hunt the Hare and turn her down the rocky road
all the way to Dublin, Whack follol de rah!
Twas in the merry month of May, from me home I started,
Left the girls in Tuam, nearly broken hearted,
Saluted father dear, kissed me darling mother,
Drank a pint of beer, me grief and tears to smother,
Then off to reap the corn, leave where I was born
Cut a stout black thorn to banish ghosts and goblin;
Bought a pair of brogues, rattling o\'er the bogs
And fright\'ning all the dogs on the rocky road to Dublin.
One, two, three four, five,
Hunt the Hare and turn her down the rocky road
all the way to Dublin, Whack follol de rah!
In Mullingar that night I rested limbs so weary,
Started by daylight next morning blithe and early,
Took a drop of pure to keep me heart from sinking;
Thats a Paddy\'s cure whenever he\'s on drinking.
See the lassies smile, laughing all the while
At me curious style, \'twould set your heart a bubblin\'
Asked me was I hired, wages I required,
I was almost tired of the rocky road to Dublin.
One, two, three four, five,
Hunt the Hare and turn her down the rocky road
all the way to Dublin, Whack follol de rah!
In Dublin next arrived, I thought it such a pity
To be soon deprived a view of that fine city.
So then I took a stroll, all among the quality;
Me bundle it was stole, all in a neat locality.
Something crossed me mind, when I looked behind,
No bundle could I find upon me stick a wobblin\'
Enquiring for the rogue, they said me Connaught brogue
Wasn\'t much in vogue on the rocky road to Dublin.
One, two, three four, five,
Hunt the Hare and turn her down the rocky road
all the way to Dublin, Whack follol de rah!
From there I got away, me spirits never falling,
Landed on the quay, just as the ship was sailing.
The Captain at me roared, said that no room had he;
When I jumped aboard, a cabin found for Paddy.
Down among the pigs, played some hearty rigs,
Danced some hearty jigs, the water round me bubbling;
When off Holyhead I wished meself was dead,
Or better for instead on the rocky road to Dublin.
One, two, three four, five,
Hunt the Hare and turn her down the rocky road
all the way to Dublin, Whack follol de rah!
The boys of Liverpool, when we safely landed,
Called meself a fool, I could no longer stand it.
Blood began to boil, temper I was losing;
Poor old Erin\'s Isle they began abusing.
"Hurrah me soul" says I, me Shillelagh I let fly.
Some Galway boys were by, saw I was a hobble in,
With a load "Hurray !" joined in the affray.
We quickly cleared the way for the rocky road to Dublin.
One, two, three four, five,
Hunt the Hare and turn her down the rocky road
all the way to Dublin, Whack follol de rah!
One, two, three four, five,
Hunt the Hare and turn her down the rocky road
all the way to Dublin, Whack follol de rah'b"I don't know if you can see, the changes that have come over me
In these last few days, I've been afraid, that I might drift away
I've been tellin' old stories, singing songs
That made me think, about where I've come from
And that's the reason why I seem so far away today.
Let me tell you that I love you
And I think about you all the time
Caledonia you're calling me, now I'm goin' home
But if I should become a stranger
Know that it would make me more than sad
Caledonia's been everything I've ever had.
I have moved, and I've kept on movin'
Proved the points that I needed provin'
I Lost the friends that I needed losin'
Found others on the way
I've kissed the girls and left them crying
Stolen dreams, yes there's no denying
I've traveled hard sometimes with conscience flyin'
Somewhere in the wind
Let me tell you that I love you
And I think about you all the time
Caledonia you're calling me, now I'm goin' home
But if I should become a stranger
Know that it would make me more than sad
Caledonia's been everything I've ever had."b'Hear our hymn from the heartland. {***someone speaks words in the

Weve said our last goodbyes
His souls been blessed
Hes laid to rest
And its now I feel alone
He was more than just my father
My teacher my best friend
He can still be heard
In the tunes we shared
When we play them on my own
(chorus)
I never will forget him
For he made me "what I am"
Though he may be gone
Memories linger on
And I miss him, the old man
As a boy hed take me walking
By mountain, field and stream
And he\'d show me things
Not known to kings
And secret between him and me
Like the colors of the pheasant
As he rises in the dawn
Or how to fish and make a wish
Beside the fairy tree
(chorus)
I never will forget him
For he made me "what I am"
Though he may be gone
Memories linger on
And I miss him, the old man
I thought hed live forever
He seemed so big and strong
But the minutes fly
And the years roll by
For a father and a son
And suddenly when it happened
There was so much left unsaid
No second chance
To tell him thanks
For everything hed done
(chorus)
Oh, I never will forget him
For he made me "what I am"
Though he may be gone
Memories linger on
God, I miss him, the old man'b"True you ride the finest horse I've ever seen
Standing 16' one or two, with eyes wild and green
You ride the horse so well, hands light to the touch
I could never go with you no matter how I wanted to
Ride on, see you
I could never go with you no matter how I wanted to
Ride on, see you, I could never go with you no matter how I wanted to
When you ride into the night, without a trace behind
Run your claw along my gut, one last time
I turn to face an empty space, where you used to lie
I look for the spark that lights the night
Through a teardrop in your eye
Ride on, see you, I could never go with you no matter how I wanted to
Ride on, see you, I could never go with you no matter how I wanted to
Ride on, see you, I could never go with you no matter how I wanted to
Ride on, see you, I could never go with you no matter how I wanted to
I could never go with you no matter how I wanted to
I could never go with you no matter how I wanted to"b'Woman, such a delicate creature
Every feature needs to be loved from the start
Defend her and shell surrender
Offend her and she will harden her heart
A delicate creature is something she aint, but atake it from me thats a woman
That isnt an angel, that isnt saint, but atake it from me thats woman
She knows how to please and she knows how to play, take it from me thats a woman
Forget to honor love and obey shell take you and break you and throw you away,
Thats a woman, Thats a woman.
She knows every move and knows every trick, take it from me thats a woman
How to kill with a word and cut to the quake(?) take it from me, thats a woman
How to look through you as if youre not there, take it form me thats a woman
How to say no with a flick of her hair, shell turn you and burn you and not even care, Thats a woman, thats a woman
Faithful and true, thats a woman, trusting in you, thats a woman
Gentle and constantly caring, strong as the love she is sharing
When you look in the eyes of a woman (look in here eyes, youll see nothing but lies, thats a woman)
And through the disguise of a woman (every one is the same, shes just playing a game, shes a woman)
Youll see in all there, theres romance in the air
Nothing else can compare, thats a woman.
Woman, so soft and beguiling,
See her smiling, and feel your heart all aglow
Enfold her, lay her head on your shoulder
And hold her till you just cant let her go.
Treat her as if you just dont give a damn, thats how to handle a woman
Be more of a stallion, less of a lamb, thats how to handle a woman
Keep her hanging around till shes ready to burst, thats how to handle a woman
Dont try to be bad, be the worst, do unto others but just do it first
To a woman, to a woman
Be wise, be wary and be on your guard, thats how to handle a woman
If you feel that youre falling, youd better be hard, cause thats how to handle a woman
Dont let her get closer, and dont let her in, thats how to handle a woman
Cuz if you allow her get under your skin, my friend thats the end, cause you aint gonna win
With a woman, with a woman
Look at her body and look at her move, now thats what I call a woman
Im thinking now Ive got something to prove, cause thats what I call a woman
All my moves are stalling here, I cant get through to this woman
The pipes, the pipes are calling here, I think I could be falling here for this woman
What a woman
Faithful and true, thats a woman (She couldnt be true, shes just playing with you, what a woman)
Trusting in you, thats a woman (Trusting in who, you just havent a clue, what a woman
Gentle and constantly caring (Just let it be this ones for me, what a woman)
Strong as the love she is sharing
When you look in the eyes of a woman
And through the disguise of a woman
Youll see it(?) all there, theres romance in the air
Nothing else can compare, thats a wo-

Oh, mist rolling in from the sea
My desire is always to be here

Far have I traveled and much have I seen
Dark distant mountains with valleys of green
Past painted deserts, the sunsets on fire
As he carries me home to the mull of Kintyre
Mull of Kintyre
Oh, mist rolling in from the sea
My desire is always to be here
Oh, mull of Kintyre

Come by the hills to the land where fancy is free
And stand where the peaks meet the sky and the loughs meet the sea
Where the rivers run clear and the bracken is gold in the sun
And the cares of tomorrow can wait till this day is done
Come by the hills to the land where life is a song
And stand where the birds fill the air with their joy all day long
Where the trees sway in time and even the wind sings in tune
And the cares of tomorrow can wait till this day is done
Come by the hills to the land where legend remains
The stories of old fill our hearts and may yet come again
Where the past has been lost and the future is still to be won
And the cares of tomorrow can wait till this day is done
And the cares of tomorrow can wait till this day is done"b"Steal away, Let's steal away,

But, really, this can't wait

Before it gets too late

Love has finally died
This is no happy home
But God knows how I've tried
Because you're all I have, my boy
You are my life, my pride, my joy
And if I stay, I stay because of you, my boy

Why put you through that hell

You been out ridin' fences for so long now
Oh, you're a hard one
I know that you got your reasons
These things that are pleasin' you
Can hurt you somehow
Don't you draw the queen of diamonds, boy
She'll beat you if she's able
You know the queen of hearts is always your best bet
Now it seems to me, some fine things
Have been laid upon your table
But you only want the ones that you can't get
Desperado, oh, you ain't gettin' no younger
Your pain and your hunger, they're drivin' you home
And freedom, oh freedom well, that's just some people talkin'
Your prison is walking through this world all alone
Don't your feet get cold in the winter time?
The sky won't snow and the sun won't shine
It's hard to tell the night time from the day
You're losin' all your highs and lows
Ain't it funny how the feeling goes away?
Desperado, why don't you come to your senses?
Come down from your fences, open the gate
It may be rainin', but there's a rainbow above you
You better let somebody love you
You better let somebody, before it's too late."b"Like a bird without wings
That longs to be flying,
Like a motherless child
Left lonely and crying.
Like a song without words,
Like a world without music,
I wouldn't know what to do
I'd be lost without you
Watchin' over me.
I get so lonely, when you're away
I count every moment, I wait every day,
Until you're home again
And hug me so tight
That's when I know
Everything is alright.
Like a bird without wings
That longs to be flying,
Like a motherless child
Left lonely and crying.
Like a song without words
Like a world without music,
I wouldn't know what to do
I'd be lost without you
Watchin' over me.
You're my guardian angel
My light and my guide
Your hand on my shoulder
And you by my side.
You make everything beautiful,
You make me complete.
Everything in my world
I lay at your feet
Like a church with no steeple,
Where a bell never rings.
In a town without people,
Where no voice in the choir ever sings.
If a boat on the ocean
Would be lost with no sail,
Then without your devotion
Surely all that I dreamed of would fail.
Like a song without words
Like a world without music,
I wouldn't know what to do
I'd be lost without you
Watchin' over me
I wouldn't know what to do
I'd be lost without you
Watchin' over me"b"And if she asks you why, you can tell her that I told you
That I'm tired of castles in the air.
I've got a dream I want the world to share
And castle walls just lead me to despair.
Hills of forest green where the mountains touch the sky,
A dream come true, I'll live there till I die.
I'm asking you to say my last goodbye.
The love we knew ain't worth another try.
Save me from all the trouble and the pain.
I know I'm weak, but I can't face that girl again.
Tell her the reasons why I can't remain,
Perhaps she'll understand if you tell it to her plain.
But how can words express the feel of sunlight in the morning,
In the hills, away from city strife.
I need a country woman for my wife;
I'm city born, but I love the country life.
For I cannot be part of this cocktail generation:
Partners waltz, devoid of all romance.
The music plays and everyone must dance.
I'm bowing out. I need a second chance.
Save me from all the trouble and the pain.
I know I'm weak, but I can't face that girl again.
Tell her the reasons why I can't remain,
Perhaps shell understand if you tell it to her plain.
And if she asks you why, you can tell her that I told you
That I'm tired of castles in the air.
I've got a dream I want the world to share
And castle walls just lead me to despair.

Are a home now for me
But my home is the lowlands
And always will be
Some day you'll return to
Your valleys and your farms
And you'll no longer burn
To be brothers in arms
Through these fields of destruction
Baptisms of fire
I've witnessed your suffering
As the battles raged higher
And though they did hurt me so bad
In the fear and alarm
You did not desert me
My brothers in arms
There's so many different worlds
So many different suns
And we have just one world
But we live in different ones
Now the sun's gone to hell
And the moon's riding high
Let me bid you farewell
Every man has to die
But it's written in the starlight
And every line on your palm
We're fools to make war
On our brothers in arms"b"So see the leaves fall to the ground,
And see then lyin' all around,
Cause still I can't see you,
And there's the wind that plays in the air,
Flying around how it does not care
still I can't see you
And the seasons pass away
And I still sit here lonely, each and every day.
Wondering what's gone wrong.
Cause I don't remember seasons lasting oh so long,
Oh so long
And I still can't see you
And I still can't see you
And I still can't see you
Lauren and I
Lauren and I
I'm dreaming every night
I'm searching every day
I had her in my sights
and let her slip away
And there's the stars way in the sky
leading my way and i don't know where or why
still I can't see you.
And when my backs against the wall
I see a reason for it all
but still I can't see you
I'm dreaming every night
I'm searching every day
I had her in my sights
and let her slip away
And I still can't see you
And I still can't see you
And I still can't see you
Lauren and I
Lauren and I"b"Gonna take a little time
A little time to think things over
I better read between the lines
In case I need it when I?m older
Now this mountain I must climb
Feels like a world upon my shoulders
Through the clouds I see love shine
It keeps me warm as life grows colder
In my life there?s been heartache and pain
I don?t know if I can face it again
Can?t stop now, I?ve travelled so far
To change this lonely life
I wanna know what love is
And I want you to show me
I wanna feel what love is
And I know you can show me
I'm gonna take a little time
I?m gonna take a little time
A little time to look around me
'cause I?ve got nowhere left to hide
It looks like love has finally found me
In my life there?s been heartache and pain
I don?t know if I can face it again
I can?t stop now, I?ve traveled so far
To change this lonely life
I wanna know what love is
And I want you to show me
I wanna feel what love is
And I know you can show me
I wanna know what love is
I know you can show me
I want to feel what love is
And I know you can show me
Wanna feel what love is"b"And they called it 'puppy love'
Oh I guess they'll never know
How a young heart really feels
And why I love her so
And they call it puppy love
Just because we're in are teens
Tell them all, please tell them it isn't fair
To take away my only dream
I cry each night
My tears for you
My tears are all in vain
I hope and I pray
That maybe someday
You'll be back
In my arms
Once again
Someone help me
Help me please
Is the answer up above
How can I oh how can I tell them
This is not a 'puppy love'
Someone help me, help me, help me please
Is the answer up above
How can I?
Oh how can I tell them
This is not a 'puppy love'"b"There were three old gypsies came to our hall door
They came brave and boldly-o

It was upstairs and downstairs the lady went
Put on her suit of leather-o
T'was a cry all around the door
She's away wi' the raggle taggle gypsy-o
It was late that night when the lord came in
Inquiring for his lady-o
The servant girl replied to her Lord

Never reaching the end
Letters I?ve written
Never meaning to send
Beauty I?d always missed
With these eyes before
Just what the truth is
I can?t say anymore
Cause? I love you
Yes, I love you
Oh, how I love you
Gazing at people
Some hand in hand
Just what I?m going through
They can?t understand
Some try to tell me
Thoughts they can?t defend
Just what you want to be
You will be in the end
And I love you
Yes, I love you
Oh, how I love you
How I love you
And I love you
Yes, I love you
Oh, how I love you
How I love you'b'The moonlight dances among the trees
The campfire glows in the autumn breeze
and I am lost in my thoughts of you
Remember me, recuerda me
A comrade strums on a sad guitar
My mind is drifting to where you are
I\'m holding you as I used to do
remember me, recuerda me, mi amor!
So long ago, so far away, each night I pray
"volvero los dias passoados"
I promise you that come what may
those days will stay ever in my memory
In all this world I could never find, the love that I had to leave behind
But duty calls, so whate\'er befalls
remember me, recuerda me, mi amor'b"She may be the face I can't forget
The trace of pleasure or regret
May be my treasure or the price I have to pay.
She may be the song the Psalmist sings
May be the chilly Autumn breeze
May be a hundred different things
Within the measure of a day.
She may be the beauty or the beast
May be the famine or the feast
May turn each day into a Heaven or a Hell.
She may be the mirror of my dreams
A smile reflected in a stream
She may not be what she may seem inside her shell.
She who always seems so happy in a crowd
Who's eyes can be so private and so proud
No one's allowed to see them when they cry.
She may be the love that cannot hope to last
That comes to me through shadows of the past
And I'll remember 'til the day I die.
She may be the reason I survive
The why and wherefore I'm alive
The one I'll care for through the rough and ready years.
Me, I'll take her laughter and her tears
And make them all my souvenirs
For where she goes I've got to be
The meaning of my life is she
She
Oh, She"b"'Twas Joey the Weasel that gave us the wire
They were closing our factory down
Though we didn't believe him and we called him a liar
The redundancy letters came round
As we read them in silence, I choked back a tear
It was hard to believe after twenty-odd years
Farewell my companions, my friends and my workmates
Farewell to the paydays, the pints and the craic
Oh, We gave them our best years now they've paid us back
By making us yesterday's men
Sure as hell
By making us yesterday's men
So we said our goodbyes by the factory gates
One cold Friday evening last year
And I saw it all there in the eyes of ma mates
The anger, the sadness, the fear
Like our fathers before us we worked there with pride
Now we fought back the bitterness burning inside
Farewell my companions, my friends and my workmates
Farewell to the paydays, the pints and the craic
Oh we gave them our best years now they've paid us back
By making us yesterday's men
Sure as hell
By making us yesterday's men
Ah, now Jimmy, said she,
Give the kids a few bob,
After all, sure it is Friday night
But how could I tell her I was out of a job
From now on things were going to be tight
How well I remember it cut like a knife
I was never a day on the dole in my life
Farewell my companions, my friends and my workmates
Farewell to the paydays, the pints and the craic
Oh, We gave them our best years now they've paid us back
By making us yesterday's men
Sure as hell
By making us yesterday's men
The machines now are silent, the workbenches bare
And there's dust on the factory floor
They've boarded the windows and have chained up the gates
And have padlocked the factory door
Now I'm on the scrap-heap, and I'm thirty-nine
Just one of the hundreds, shot down in my prime
Farewell my companions, my friends and my workmates
Farewell to the paydays, the pints and the craic
Oh, We gave them our best years now they've paid us back
By making us yesterday's men
Sure as hell
By making us yesterday's men
Farewell my companions, my friends and my workmates
Farewell to the paydays, the pints and the craic
Oh, We gave them our best years now they've paid us back
By making us yesterday's men
Sure as hell
By making us yesterday's men"b"I am a sailor, you're my first mate
We signed on together, we coupled our fate
We hauled up our anchor, determined not to fail
For the heart's treasure, together we set sail
With no maps to guide us, we steered our own course
We rode out the storms when the winds were gale force
We sat out the doldrums in patience and hope
Working together, we learned how to cope
Life is an ocean, love is a boat
In troubled waters, it keeps us afloat
When we started the voyage, there was just me and you
Now, gathered 'round us, we have our own crew
Together we're in this relationship
We built it with care to last the whole trip
Our crew destination's not marked on any charts
We're navigating for the shores of the heart"b"They say the skies of Lebanon are burning
Those mighty cedars bleeding in the heat
They're showing pictures on the television
Women and children dying in the street
And we're still at it in our own place
Still trying to reach the future through the past
Still trying to carve tomorrow from a tombstone
But hey, don't listen to me
This wasn't meant to be no sad song
We've heard too much of that before
Right now I only want to be with you
Till the mornin' dew comes fallin'
And I want to take you to the island
Trace your footprints in the sand
And in the evening when the sun goes down
We'll make love to the sound of the ocean
They're raisin' banners over by the markets
White washing slogans on our ship yard walls
Witch doctors praying for a mighty showdown
No way our holy flag is gonna fall
Up here we sacrifice our children
To feed the worn out dreams of yesterday
And teach them dying will lead us into glory
But hey, don't listen to me.
'Cause this wasn't meant to be no sad song
I've sung too much of that before
Right now I only want to be with you
Till the mornin' dew comes fallin'
I want to take you to the island
Trace your footprints in the sand
And in the evening when there's no one around
We'll make love to the sound of the ocean
Now I know us plain folks don't see all the story
And I know this peace and love's just copping out
And I guess these young boys dyin' in the ditches
Is just what being free is all about
And how this twisted wreckage down main street
Will bring us all together in the end
And we'll go marching down the road to freedom
Freedom
Freedom"b"They say that I'm a bad boy
That I just can't help myself
That even though I know I should
I'm just too bad to be good
They call me a romancer,
A chancer, a gigolo
Who'll always have an alibi
Who'll kiss the girls and make them cry
[Chorus]
I never meant to hurt you
I never meant to break your heart in two
I'm sorry if I hurt you
I'm sorry, but it's what I seem to do
They call me a heartbreaker
Nothing, but a heartbreaker
They say I'm the dark destroyer
That I just can't get enough
Of girls hanging on a string
That I'm only after one thing
That I'm filled with desire
A liar, a Romeo
Like a bee in a honey comb
Welcome to the pleasure dome!
[Chorus]
They call me a heartbreaker
Nothing, but a heartbreaker
I just can't live without it
The thrill of a woman's touch
It's written in the stars above
I'm just addicted to love
But they all want to train me
To chain me and tie me down
Don't they know I was born to be
Footloose and fancy-free
[Chorus]
They call me a heartbreaker
Nothing, but a heartbreaker"b"They say for every boy and girl
There's just one love in this whole world
And I know I found mine
The heavenly touch of your embrace
Tells me no one could take your place
Ever in my heart
Young love, first love
Filled with deep devotion
Young love, our love
We share with deep emotion
Just one kiss from your sweet lips
Will tell me that our love is real
And I can feel that it's true
For we will vow to one another
There will never be another
Love for you or for me
Young love, first love
Filled with deep devotion
Young love, our love
We share with deep emotion
Young love, first love
Filled with deep devotion
Young love, first love
Filled with deep devotion"b"Oh, Mary, this London's a wonderful sight
The people here are working by day and by night
They don't sow potatoes, nor barley, nor wheat
But there's gangs of them diggin' for gold in the street
At least, when I asked them, that's what I was told
So I just took a hand at this diggin' for gold
But for all that I've found there I might as well be
In the place where the dark Mournes sweep down to the sea
There's beautiful girls here, oh never you mind
Beautiful shapes nature never designed
Lovely complexions of roses and cream
But let me remark with regard to the same
That if at those roses you venture to sip
Colors might fall come away on your lips
So I'll wait for the white rose that's waitin for me
In the place where the dark Mournes sweep down to the sea
You remember young Davey McClaren of course
Well sure now he's round here with the rest of the force
I saw him one day as I was crossin the strand
And he stopped the whole street with a wave of his hand
And as we stood talkin of days that are gone
The whole town of London stood there to look on
But for all his great powers he's wishful like me
To be back where the dark Mournes sweep down to the sea
But for all his great powers he's wishful like me
To be back where the dark Mournes sweep down to the sea"b'Love thee dearest, love thee
Yes, by yonder star I swear
Which through tears above thee
Shines so sadly fair
Thou, too, oft dimmed
With tears like him
Like him my truth will shine
And love thee, dearest, love thee
Yes ? till death I?m thine.
Dormi amore dormi
Porta il fuore dove vuoi
Vola verso I sogni
Bella come sei
Tue sei per me la stella she
Per sempre brillera
E dormi amore dormi
E gia notte ormai
Dimmi amore dimmi
Che non te ne andrai mai piu
Quante notti insonni
Se mi manchi tu
Accanto a me le vuvole
Non torneranno mai
E sogna tutti I sogni
Che l?amore da

From glen to glen and down the mountain side

On the western front the guns all died away
And lying in the mud on bags of sand
We heard a German sing from no man's land
He had tenor voice so pure and true
The words were strange but every note we knew
Soaring o'er the living dead and damned
A German sang of peace from no man's land
They left their trenches and we left ours
Beneath tin hats the smiles bloomed like wild flowers
With photos cigarettes and pots of wine
We built a soldier's truce on the front line
Their singer was a lad of 21
We begged another song before the dawn
And sitting in the mud and blood and fear
He sang again the song all longed to hear
Silent night, no cannons roar
A King is born of peace for evermore
All's calm, all's bright
All brothers hand in hand
In 19 and 15 in no man's land
And in the morning all the guns boomed in the rain
And we killed them and they killed us again
At night they charged - we fought them hand to hand
And I killed the boy that sang in no man's land
Silent night, no cannons roar
A King is born of peace for evermore
All's calm, all's bright
All brothers hand in hand
And that young soldier sings
And the song of peace still rings
Though the captains and all the kings
Built no man's land
Sleep in heavenly peace."b'Comfort ye.

You know there's a price to pay
Show me
What I used to be
Show me
What I used to be
I'm gon' need a diamond stone to release me, to release me x2
Cause I'm nothing like you (ooh)
I could never tell you the truth
You know there's a price to pay
For living through me"b"Held in this gaze
Where's the sun tonight?
Help me escape
All this it multiplies
Ever give up on fate?
There's a truth a mile high
Never give up again
Witness you through my eyes
Oh, I know
He is here
And I lost in this blame
I'm lost in this pain
Show me the shape of your mother's arms
Help me explain your father's eyes
Never give up again
There's a truth a mile high
What's the worst of faith?
It ensures a goodbye
Oh, I know
He is here
And I laugh at this blame
I laugh at this pain
Oh, I know
He is here
And I'm lost in this pain
Eternity's tales
Where do I belong... can I belong with you?
Turn my head
Underneath the summer moon
Feel his breath
Conjure up the truth I feel
I'm so confused I feel
Kiss this night
Photographic memory
I feel I'm lost again
Underneath my heart holds this gravity
I feel full of this uncertainty
Take me away from this
I know he is here
I laugh at this blame
Can I live with this pain
Oh, how do I know he is here?
I look at your face
I belong, oh, I belong
I know I belong to you"b'Lie in darkness of her daily gaze
write the words I will never say
blues and ragdolls over the railings edge
lost forever in your head
I recall moments over and done
then daylight enters-the sun
and I wake up
try to mask with over saline words
raise your glass to empty words
lean the dashboard
my hero is underground
he is gone forever
sleeping sound
I recall moments run into one
then daylight enters-the sun
and I wake up'b'If you become the odds
educated in words around the starless nights
you write and you are speaking to me
like every word you say can break apart
something real it is handed down
the father is educated in life
through all the brilliant tarts you like
and you have sewn needily
I cant make any sound
I breathe...
its the fear that is in you
that brings the fear out in me
its the ghost unaware of where you might be
its the feeling in you
that brings the fear out in me
its a ghost I wont wake up
the next time I breathe
Moving forward on
I will educate you in lines around
I will break apart stars you like
your soul speaks to me in tones
I have never heard
this is overly sweet
I read and plead
its the fear that is in you
that brings the fear out in me
its ghost unaware of where you might be
its the feeling in you
that brings the fear out in me
its a ghost I wont wake up
the next time I breathe'b"Holding open time to rest awhile
I am playing in the darkness of warm July
Tryst between the scenes not happy,
As it seems you play with forgiveness
For wicked schemes
I know years ago
I know now\xc3\x83\xc2\xa2?\xc3\x82\xc2\xa6
You seem like some devil
You play like some god
Clean before the stream to innocence you cling
The beauty in the crime is you don't feel; a thing
Scars we wore years ago hurt now
You seemed like some devil
And you prayed like you were god
These roses form a ring around your cell
In these ashes
We all fall down
Hold on to the divine we'll all fall down.
Stars I wished on years ago burnt out
You seemed like some devil
You played like some god
These roses form a ring around our selves in the ashes we all fall down
Hold on to the divine we'll all fall down."b'Hailstones and daggers
give heat without your light
ghost of your angel
speaks to me tonight
heaven knows
and I think shes the only one
counting the days away
pulling up the sun
and now you sleep darling
echoes peacefully and slight
bound now to strangers
slowly losing sight
heaven knows
and I think shes the only one
counting the days away
pulling up the sun
and now you praised for this moment
the blindly written page
broken hearts murmur
charmed in all their rage
heaven knows
and I think shes the only one
counting the days away
pulling up the sun...
and now you'b'Taking in the rhythm of the world
let your mind tell you the words
stay within the river I have loved
with my own sense of good
and I write you once or twice
with an eye like a firefly
taste the cooler water
breathe the air
let in your want of life and air
we will take on any problem in the world
if our own are understood
and I write you in more than blood
and I hope that you see
I know that someday
in your eyes I see someday
in your words I am reminded
in your eyes I see someday
we will pray through all the weather
to tame the world for all life knows good
I will save you from the wicked
I will take the world in my arms
my own sense of the word
and I write you only lies
can you see they are my disguise
I know that someday
in your eyes I see someday
in your words I am reminded
in your eyes I see someday'b'Aisle of fire
close to you and desire
I\'m half way home
The worst stings in life have left me numb
Please don\'t leave this disaster
The hummingbird as my imposter
Aching sighs
To the words and the writing
I\'m blind
Ghosts run in my angels eyes
Sing words so soft from my mind
Believe the eyes of iolite
Please don\'t believe the way they want you to leave
Blaming arms are better I think left alone
Ghost ride in my angels eyes
steal words so soft from my mind
believe in the eyes of iolite
"Tell you why I won\'t cry
Tempted by life
Want this strife I suppose
Tell you know
I was light, Iolite"'b'Tekst niedost\xc4\x99'b'Sunlight moves through darkened halls
the same voice is calling me home
time goes back and round again
only your name in my head
thoughts will pass
sleep well tonight
I know your demons and delight...
some time goes back and round again
holding the rain in my hand
lose your worth and then your heart
I know there is no way I will stop
I know nothing that I write
but i can see your world
cant you see mine
can you see through my eyes
can you see through mine'b"Higher than the highest mountain
deeper than the eye can see
words are falling out like prayers
none nearer to my heart than thee
lines I walk are not the straightest
clouds fill up my head again
plagued with merely indecision
I reach out in search of life
I see the oasis
but the water it's too deep
I dont want to get lost
in the water it's too deep
night comes I will build my refuge
and hope its not destroyed in light
bring to my life truth and worse
I reach out in spite of life
I see the oasis
but the water it's too deep
I dont want to get lost
in the water it's too deep
heart and head work as one
let me drink and move on
still my faith in rising suns
always leads me here
I see the oasis
but the water it's too deep
I dont want to get lost
in the water it's too deep"b"Once there was time
It lay in front of me
With tendrils and curves of what was yet to be
Afraid of the beast, not in the least
A heart for a brain and lips sweet again
with the taste of life
Slumber through the years
where hurt stings blinking tears
and dark hides my skin from the sun and yet again
Its those who dare to really get in
that feed me with their eyes
Those who dare to really get in
that feed me with their smile
But it's no, never enough
It could burn like white light but it's not enough
It can burn like white light, it's never enough
Now there is time to lay in blame with me
and despite all I write you live well
It seems to me
Those who dare to really get in
they feed me with their eyes
Its those who dare to really get in
that feed me with their smile
But it's no, never enough
It can burn like fire still its not enough
No it's not, it's not enough.
It can burn like fire its never enough"b"Is it real, can I see you?
Or is it just elusive dreaming?
Far and away are you
Am I here in your breath?
Remnants of where you are I am
Lost and how I wait for you ...holding on
After all this time I still carry my heart blind
oh I am killing time with liars ... its all this time
It's in your voice
all we are is nowhere that I am
Lonely and I still wait for you ...holding on
After all this time I still carry my heart blind
oh I am killing time with liars ...it's only time
All this time recreating my mind
...eyes open wide
...to all this crime...
After all this time I still carry my heart blind
After all this time I am still blind,
Still Killing time with liars
All this time recreating my mind...all this time"b"Unknown seems to rush through my veins
So far you've been this close to me
You can share my words
You can feel my breath
So far you've been this close to me
I feel this ever-lucid song I'll never learn
The quiet street, where you held me
I feel love I've never known
And when you speak, do you speak to me?
So far, you feel this close to real
If you share my world you can take my breath away
So far you've been this close to me
And it feels like water through my hand
You see, life is a million grains of sand
I feel this ever-lucid song I'll never know
The quiet street you hold me
I feel love I've never known
Unknown seems to rush through my veins
So far you feel this close to me
I can feel this time it's closer to the fire than I
So far you've been this close to me
And it feels like water through my hand
You seem close but times a million grains of sand
I feel this heady-lucid sigh I will never learn
These quiet streets, will you help me?
I feel love I've never known
I feel this senseless peace, yes, I will never learn
Close my eyes, sleep, dream, where I keep this locked
I'll never know Lose my mind
Unknown seems to rush through my veins
So far you been this close to me"b"If I were to fall
Know I love you
If I weren't holding your hand so tight
If I were to fall through a crack in time
Would I rise or fall
Hounded and all aglow
If I weren't holding your hand so tight?
If I weren't caught in the last mistake
If I weren't holding the blind remains
Would I remember this, or end all there is
If I weren't holding your hand so tight?
Then I see you as the mad hero all alone
If I were to fall through a crack in time
If I were to fall
If I were to fall
Know I love you"b"You lie, you lie in consequence
You stay as part of sympathy
Can it be you'd break?
If the thoughts and words collide
You might cry to fate
This tension is part of me
This chemistry
All that I have ever known
Is in pieces of light in the shadows
You take, you take this honesty, this symmetry
And you wait, you wait for suffering
Can it be that you stay
When thoughts and worlds collide?
You might hide but you take
You can take this whole of me
Can it be?
All that I have ever known
Is in pieces of light in the shadows
It's like I think I was immune
To the pieces of me in the sun and in the shadow
Tonight the wounded heart's deafening
You wait for all of these things I believe
But you live, fear won't change a word, destiny
But you rain, reign over my heart and [Incomprehensible]
All that I have ever known
Is in pieces of blue in the shadows
It's like I think I was immune
To the pieces of me in the sun and in the shadow
Tonight the wounded heart's deafening
You live here, you won't change a word
So just believe"b"Here, hold my breath
Feel the tremble I know best
The fear in my mind is the echo in my heart
Cold and plain
As you watch me
Fall apart
These tears are warmer than the sun
The heart I share with you
Maybe manic or diseased
But always true
If you keep me here you can chase away this pain...
I'm warm again and in your light I'll stay
These tears are warmer than the sun"b'Knew you were born under a waxing moon
Wide eyed and waiting for most the view
Sharper than moonlight
All is one
"Heaven awaits you now..hope you find our door"
Eyes pressed tightly, waltz with stars
The sweeter now must move on
Your words are so beguiling ...all is right this
"Heaven and constancy" I hope you learned
Can I hold you in pages adore you your words
they have power over me
I have dreamed of your majesty
The pain of this illusion comforts me
it reminds me of how well I was, the next to leave
earching for a heart as ripe as your smile
I have left you here hope you hide me
Can hold you in pages I adore you these words
they cast this feeling over me
Can I know you in pages enthrall you in words
that have this power over me'b"The night I woke in laughter
the pain came surely after
tried to rise above the sinking feeling
then the rain fell through my ceiling
the lives I lead are not a strangers
and the quiet I need protects me from danger
I have relied on some strangers notion
close my eyes I am thinking emotion
all I have ever wanted
isn't so strangely out of sync
with where I am now
and if the truth remains in verses
I know the worst is over now
over land and sea in the motion
I have survived more on heat than immersion
I have relied on some divine notion
close my eyes
think I am sick from the motion
all I have ever wanted
isnt so strangely out of sync
with where I am now
and if the truth remains in verses
I know the verse is over now
and with a stronger tie than worship
I know you are there following me
through all the verses I write
and if my truth remains in front of me
I know you are there
I know the worst is over now"b"In between the truth
And what I see or what I feel or what I've become
Is still an aching need
And I'm hardly even alive
I'm feeling like a murderous vine
You are my mirror
And I'm on my knees pleading
You are my mirror
Oh, don't stop loving me
I can see the changes within me
What I feel or what I need or what I've become
I still feel I'm your slave and I hardly ever lie
I need you like my faith in the divine
You are my mirror
And I'm on my knees bleeding
You are my mirror
Oh, don't stop loving me"b"You might be like
The autumn exposed
You might be all the things
I love the most
And you might tell me the truth
And I might be reminded of you
In everything I see and that I feel
You might be...
Since you're on your own
I scream goodbye
It tears my heart out
It stings my eyes
The fear of wanting, you know it's true
The fever hurting all of you
And maybe this is true
Divine and in love
In the silence of you
This beauty calls at me
When I sleep
You might be...
Since you're on your own
It seems goodbye
It tears my heart out
It stings my eyes
The fear of wanting, you know it's true
The fear of wanting all of you
And she is not good or bad
Oh, but she wants all she could have
Your soul's familiar call
This is it... I am and
It's not like me
But since you're on your own
It seems goodbye
It tears my heart out
It stings my eyes
The fear of wanting you know, it's true
The fever of wanting all of you
Since you're on your own
You wave goodbye
It tears my heart out
It stings my eyes
The fear of wanting you know it's true
The fever of wanting all of you
All of you
And you might be..."b"Paradise where have you gone
I long so to see your shore
I have to wait it makes my eyes sore
Sinking more all the time
Blessed by your request on high
I was lied to
Wrought by learning less from outside
I had a right to bruise
Baited and wily the moon it always opens up for me
I'm lost in this mirror of sorts
a warrior without words.
Growing cold
I've traded wine for Elysium
I've traded souls stone to gray
I'm half-aware with my mind closed
thinking more all the time
Blessed by my new quest on high
I was lied to
Taught by the Prophets from our skies
I fell in to truth
Baited and wily oh Luna can't you open up for me
I'm lost in this mirror of sorts a warrior without war
growing cold
Baited and wily
oh luna can't you shine the way for me
I'm lost in this mirror of souls a warrior without war
I am aching so wildly
oh luna can't you shine the way
for me I am lost in this mirror of souls I'm without words.
Going home
Paradise where have you gone
I long so, to see your shore."b'Run for words I nearly catch fire
radiate slumber in this quest I\'m your wire
Running for ways I mouth that I\'m scared
radiate wonder this flesh just your fringe
Fear these chains are all I have tonight
so I simply forgive
Rings have made you sigh in the work of my
Waiting for word I nearly catch fire
never quite noticed you quench and I\'m you lighter
Fear these chains are all I have tonight
some forgive and some forget rings of pages sigh
In the work of my own life that I
Enter this this halo
Do you deny this kind of love
If you were once Cain or Abel
Then you recite this bolder life
Through this wide open heart
Do you believe this "dying we part"
Do you believe this
Fear these chains are all I wear tonight some forgive some forget rings of pages signs
in the work of my own life was my gift to you
Fear these chains are all I have tonight
so I simply forgive.
In the work of my own life I give to you'b'I hear your name and fall to desire
Here is a light and a hope on fire
I wonder how I could leave this again?
But here in the night and beside all your light?
I wonder how, How I?
For twenty-four years, I have drowned in my tears
And still can\'t find my way
I wear this name and I feel it\'s my disguise
Here was a light and a hope on fire
For twenty-four years, I have drowned in my tears
And still can\'t find my way
Never go
We can never say never
You can\'t breathe, "we will always stay together"
I say am fine
Behind four walls
Oh, but in this world
I am not fine at all
For twenty-four years, I have drowned in my fears
I still can\'t find my way.'b"Here we are
Underneath a million stars
I want to believe that I'm in your mind
I want to believe your love is blind
Feelings can go away but
How do I know who's to blame?
The stars come out when the dawn's asleep
And your heaven takes hold of me
Why do we feel?
In between the blur
Is it real?
I want to believe that love is kind
I want to believe that your love is blind
Feelings can go away and
How will I know who's to blame?
The stars come out when the dawn's asleep
And heaven takes hold of me
You gotta believe in something
You gotta believe in something
Believe in me, believe in me
Feelings can go away and
How will I know who's to blame?
The stars come out when the dawn's asleep
And heaven takes hold of me
You gotta believe in something
You gotta believe in something"b"How worn we were on such a day
You can almost feel the date
And I can't deny the pain
So I wait for the right time
To wish the world away
To walk in
And I can't help wanting every word
To escape this night
We are worn and we dress on Sunday
Try to touch the smile
And I can't describe your face
So I wait for the next time
To wish the world away
And walk in
And I can't help wanting every word
To escape this night
And with your eyes
You can't help watching everywhere
Before it begins
You can break this silence, oh, with your heart
Here we take this vow and you struggle
Invitation to the other
I will come forsake the others
I'll see you again
And you can't help wanting every word
We can escape this night
And with your arms you can't help wanting everywhere
Before it begins you can break this silence with your heart"b'Saw you again
it is like some kind of sin is turning its back on me
straight to the point
where rumours can annoy
you are always in brilliant skies
as I wander by
Pray for the day
when you say you will stay
you have gotten a hold of yourself
raised for the race
we are not what we say
there are always a million signs
dont be afraid
to say you are wandering
and life is a dream
starlight it seems
to keep escaping me
so I rely on you
rains for a hundred days
why cant you see the race is not over
still you are holding your prize
it could rain for a hundred years
can you see your fears are over your head
holding you light
dont be afraid
to say you are wandering
and life is a dream
starlight it seems
to keep escaping me
why do you run from love
and why do you run
something more is gaping?
lost in your mind is only what you seem to be
where are you going
you are going straight in
dont be afraid
to say you are wandering
and life is a dream
starlight it seems
to keep escaping me
so I rely on luck'b"The sun stole your heart and
then left you in the sane world
I do realize I'm often vague
The shore smells the sweetest when all that is left your pale your dry
And I do recognize I'm often vain
Eros stole your words and you weren't the same
-not scared of time
and I do recognize there is more than fate
the souls never-ending and worth the wait-
It's safe to fly
I do recognize this old souls face"b"No one knows her
I have seen you hold her
trembling arms and fiery eyes
things you tell her she wont remember
the moment is all she holds in hand
I can see her smile
I can say her name
the face I see
we are both the same
If I am her
why do I damn her
am I hoping she will slowly slip away
am I hoping she will drown and slip away
years have passed her
and many asked her
like quiet knights in a church bells ring
if you take her you will never break her
don't give her dreams
she will only slip away
am I hoping she will drown and slip away am I hoping I will only slip away
if only this time I would know
she fakes her mind out in an open door
she is waiting
and I know there is still some light around her eyes
she will make a sad song
and you knew it was not funny
she is only seeing you the way
the way a madman feels inside a lifeless body
and I know she is only seeing me the way...
am I hoping she will slowly slip away
am I hoping I will drown and slip away"b'Twilight in symphony
it\'s as well its what you don\'t see
So plain you\'re impatient now I wait in your eyes
It\'s in the way that your love is forgiving...
Ageless your time won\'t come
you\'re as beautiful as the sun
Tables they turn so slow
you were once now you burn
It\'s in the way that love is forsaken...
now you see the profit ...
how do you regret?
"Bring your mortar back I want to seal the eyes, the lines, and cracks...tell me I\'m not loved...I love the giver of my soul"
It\'s in the way that love is forsaken you\'ve seen the progress now do you regress?
It\'s in the way that your love is forbidden you\'ve seen this progress...If I blame, its not my fault...
It\'s on the outside.
Everafter'b"Lock of time hidden in my breath
Of things real and things I've dreamt
Holding hearts in balance it is like
Maybe we were once intertwined
Raising souls up to the moon as we
Rise again,
Maybe then we will meet
Only tides are racing through your mind
Make a wish and then goodbye
Charlatans in the ruse tonight
Where heat and light touch the sky
And the sun is rising slow there's more to write
Lock of time written in my heart
Why were we once torn apart
Only tides are racing through your mind and each
Time we meet it's bittersweet"b"[Verse 1]
I stare at the window wondering why
It feel like you left in the dark
The fi[..]ness fight are tearing us apart
[Hook]
But running away won't solve any problem
As long as you still do care
Baby don't you leave me standing here
Together we'll find a way
[Chorus:]
I know it ain't easy now
But we'll make it through somehow
Just know that my feelings are true
No matter how deep we fall
Together we standing tall
We better for me and you [?]
I want you to know I'll give my best to you
So don't you ever give up?
Girl you're my destiny,
Need you to stay with me forever and more
[Verse 2]
You're asking in [?] constantly for advices
They're telling you what you should do
But they don't know the darkness we've been through
Now we're in a crossroad but we know where to go
So baby don't take the wrong turn
Can we try destiny without you by my side? oh no
No ones as good, good as you
And there ain't nobody else
That makes me feel so true
So never let go, no never let go
I wanna share my life with you girl
Forever and more
[Bridge]
Forever and more

I know it ain't easy now
But we'll make it through somehow
Just know that my feelings are true
No matter how deep we fall
Together we standing tall
We better for me and you [?]
I want you to know I'll give my best to you
So don't you ever give up?
Girl you're my destiny,
Need you to stay with me forever and more"b"Hearts go astray, leaving hurt when they go.
I went away just when you needed me so.
Filled with regret I come back beggin' you,
Forgive, forget. Where's the love we once knew?
Open up your eyes, then you'll realize here I stand
With my everlasting love.
Need you by my side, girl you'll be my bride.
You'll never be denied everlasting love.
From the very start, open up your heart,
Be a lasting part of everlasting love.
Real love will last forever.
Ooh, ooh.
Where life's river flows, no one really knows
'til someone's there to show the way to lasting love.
Like the sun that shines, endlessly it shine,
You always will be mine. It's everlasting love.
When other loves are gone, ours will still be strong,
We have our very own everlasting love.
Real love will last forever.
You give me, you give me, you give me everlasting love
Ooh.
Open up your eyes, then you'll realize here I stand
With my everlasting love.
Need you by my side, girl you'll be my bride.
You'll never be denied everlasting love.

all my words on his lips
and my brain is on edge
i'm next to the bed
where i saw you
my weight is like his
we both lost what we kissed
and my hate burns like this
in my hands in his fist
and my love is so quick
like the legs of my kids
all the worlds i could lift
only fit
where i saw you
pile lover upon lover
'til we're covered with skin
there's nothing to discover
from the thunder and lightning
there's no way to recover
this is love not loving
but now we are all eachother
i was a brother when i saw you"b"You say you love me (x4)
You say you love me but you don't
you say you need me but you know I just can't cope
with all the dreaming and the hope
you just want to use me up and leave me here and let me go
You say you love me
I want to know what you mean
I need to know how you feel
when you say you love me
I know you want me in your life
it's just the way you want me that doesn't feel so right
I know you're trying to ease my mind
Oh, but it's not so reassuring
if you don't know for certain
You're everything I wanted
You're everything and more
but you keep lookin' over my shoulder at that open door
this world is full of silence and I am just a thought
but you'll never find me if you keep on looking for the only one
You say you love me
I want to know what you mean
I need to know how you feel
when you say you love me
You say you love me(x4)
You say you love me
(you know I just can't deal)
I want to know what you mean
(you know the way I feel)
I need to know how you feel
(tell me are you for real)
When you say you love me
You say you love me
(you say)
I want to know what you mean
Just tell me how does it feel?
When you say you love me."b'Take a little bit of this, here

You wouldn't be the first, you wouldn't be the last
To give it all up to give it all up and move on past.
Now it started out the same but we made it our own game,
And you said that I lack soul, but I never had to know,
And it was all just a game,
but we played it for the best times - and the worst times -
but we wouldn't be the first and we wouldn't be the last.
You wouldn't be the first, you wouldn't be the last
To give it all up, to give it all up, and move on past,

We discussed life in the back of my car
The back of your van
You know the psychic said that
You should be my man
We exchanged words and we acted old
We both knew the wine was cheap
And I'm a pilot and I am steering deep
And when I say that you should stay
Remember what I, I'm drinking's cheap
And I'm a pilot and I am steering deep"b"You can have me dye my pale skin
You can beat me, I'll love you while I bruise
You can take me, drug my chapped lips
You can hurt me, I'll love you while I trip
But do you think of her, hands on my waist?
And do you think of me when she screams your name?
Don't want you to drug me up, it all just hurts too much
Don't want you to drug me up, your torture was meant to be love
Do you want it?
'Cause when you fuck me
You are loving me and I am owning you
Do you hate me?
Want to teach me that my place with you
Is lying on my knees?
But do you think of her, hands on my waist?
And do you think of me when she screams your name?
Don't want you to drug me up, it all just hurts too much
Don't want you to drug me up, your torture was meant to be love
We can have a pretty house
We can have a pretty car
We can have pretty things
I know that's what you are"b'Saw you the other day, you said my hair was brown and long
I said I wasn\'t sure why I take time to talk to ya, boy
I saw her call your phone I secretly looked but you knew all along
And Blue Birds didn\'t sing, so replace my tears with a ring
Go the distance if you please
\'Cause your touches are a tease and if you really want me.
Mister please don\'t waste my time
Wasn\'t made to hear you whine
Here it comes
Boy, I tell you
A E I O U losers with their fiction
A E I O U must be an addiction
A E I O U you say, "I see myself in you,"
But you ain\'t hittin\' nothin\' with your woe
You called me the other day you said my head was sweet yet cruel
I laughed the whole way through, don\'t you see the problem is you?
I tried to shop for shoes, you raped my tired head for answers
Chased me down the street, I still don\'t think the problem is me
Go the distance if you please
\'Cause your touches are a tease and if you really
Want me.
Mister please don\'t waste my time
Wasn\'t made to hear you whine
Here it comes, boy, I tell you
A E I O U losers with their fiction
A E I O U must be an addiction

But you ain\'t hittin\' nothin\' with your woe'b"You're bankrupt in your
Bankrupt in your heart
Don't even look at me
My words could shatter glass
And as a toy soldier from my past
Have no use for you
I took you off my shelf
Don't you know I'm here for someone else
Don't be so charming
Don't be so charming
Severely lonely,
But that doesn't bother me
I got a boy on the corner
Who'd love to be kissing me, hugging me, holding me tight
I won't feel the need to call you at night
No, no, no, no, no I take it back
All I've ever said
All the things I never really meant
Take me back
I want my toy soldier
It's okay if we play pretend
I promise to forget
You're plastic and on my shelf
Let's fake romance
And I'll be someone else
Don't even touch me
My hands are cold as ice
And as a toy soldier in my life
Have nothing left to give
And all this fighting hurts
The more I yell at you
The less you seem to learn
No, no, no, no, no I take it back
All I've ever said
All the things I never really meant
Take me back I want my toy soldier
It's okay if we play pretend
I promise to forget you're plastic
And on my shelf
Let's fake romance and I'll be someone else
You're bankrupt in your, bankrupt in your heart
You're bankrupt in your, bankrupt in your heart
But I still feel the need
To see you through the night"b"If you go away, then I will know
My feelings are nothing but a curtain
Hiding me from what I should know
That I'm a pilot and I'm steering low
We discussed life in the back of my car- the back of your van
You know the psychic said that, you should be my man
We exchanged words and we acted old...

And I'm a pilot, and I am steering deep.
And when I say that you should stay.
Remember what I'm drinking's cheap.

Kicking one another, calling out names

Oh, I'm alone if I know it

So army men pick up your feet
We cannot settle for a quick defeat
Oh, don't dare cry
So lose some battles but win out the war
'Cause tears are selfish and you aren't anymore
Oh, don't dare cry
In the absence of gratitude, we all feel alone
And we all become prisoners
And that disgusting formidable road

Across the sea...and ragin' foam
And I saw you and you saw me
Through the smoke...of a crowded room
And God we were laughin'
Right down to the sea
And God we were laughin'
Laughin' you and me
And I lost you and you found me
Across the mountains...and the clear blue skies
And I saw you and you saw me
In one glance...of a stranger's eyes
And God we were laughin'
Right down to the sea
Yes God we were laughin'
Laughin' you and me
So put it down (put it down) and watch the leaves
And they're fallin' all around
So put it down (put it down)
Let the seeds touch the ground
And God we were laughin'

And God we were laughin'
Laughin' you and me

Looking from a window above
It's like a story of love
Can you hear me.
Came back only yesterday
Moving further away
Won't you hear me.
All I needed was the love you gave
All I needed for another day
All I ever knew
Only you
Sometimes when I think of your name
And it's only a game
And I need you
Listening to the words that you say
Getting harder to stay
When I see you

era of strange names
era of the death of vase
and black umbrella in the rain
our city seems to be very busy
with full of false promises
and with the skies full of smokes
and its lovers with dark hearts
i wish in the scarcity of tulips
we sat in a boat and get the courage
of sailing through the sea
you and i, alone and alone
our houses are surrounded with railings
and curtains are down behind every window
cages are filled with bird
the lips with no smile on
the eyes have become the house of questions
becoming kind is kind of impossible
there is no eager for love
nobody cares about Leily
i wish in the scarcity of tulips
we sat in a boat and get the courage
of sailing through the sea
you and i alone and alone
we sail up to the point that
the seaside would disappear from you and i
we sail the boat together
and we live there to the end of our lives
where neither its sky nor its people\'s voice
neither its sadness nor its activity
nor its best-seller flowers
are not made of iron just like here (2)
so listen and remember
and no one be aware of this (secret)
"if tommorow we\'re alive
we\'ll meet by the seaside" (4)'b'Instrumental'b"Behold the beauty that surrounds us
See the wonders we take for granted
Roam the world in all her glory
Sail the seas and climb the mountains
Discover things you never knew
Be happy that you're alive
So many reasons to remain
So many people to embrace
So many stories to be told
So many errors to correct
Turn your gaze towards the moon
Even further if you dare
Turn your face towards the sun
And be grateful that it's there
Behold the beauty we have made us
All the wonders that we created
See the cities of the ancients
In the deserts and the jungles"b'So the winter comes where we belong
I feel the cold within my heart
I see the night deep in your eyes
The winter comes at last
Here the winter comes again
Here the winter comes again
Here the winter comes again

So the winter comes where we grow strong
I hear your words melt like snow
(On my skin)
I taste your kiss, it tastes like snow
The winter comes to last
My tongue is frozen to the ground
I cry alone for times to come
It beats the daylight out of me
The winter comes to seize the day

so I build myself a tower
a lonely pillar on the plain
for no one else but me
I want to taste the clouds
between my sharpened teeth
find out if I'm a demon
or a saint in disguise
I want to close the doors
behind my bleeding back
and dance among the shadows
for future glory's lost
I want to be religious
to walk among the chosen
and wear the mark of cain
feel safe wihout regrets
The version with this last verse is on Sequencer:Beta
I want a shining armour
to burn my hate and fury
until nothing still remains
but pure thoughts of peaceful minds"b"I'm in control in this domain

Every flower I ever held
Every spring I ever had
Has died
Every man I ever knew
Every woman I ever had
Is gone
Everything I ever touched
Everything I ever had
Has died

Hear the children sing just a breath away
Dance in the heavy air along the interstate
Black lung full of fumes, choke on memories

Every home I ever had
Is lost
Every flower I ever held
Every spring I ever had
Has died
Every man I ever knew
Every woman I ever had
Is gone
Everything I ever touched

As shadows shift from gray to red I notice there's no floor
Transparent air suspends my weight as if I had no mass
Then suddenly the moon comes out from the clouded skies
Wet and cold from shifting daydreams wakeful in the sleep
Windowpane observing some commotion down below
Waiting for the noise to come to blur the weary mind
Watching as a pastime and I'm the fallen star

Shelters for the vultures hardly keeping daylight out
Marble stained with rust, faded paintings on the walls
Beaten towers crumble, haunted only by the wind
I will live forever
No angels left to hold me
I will be the final man
Picking up the given challenge of the fallen gargoyle angels
Headed on collision course with martyrs tied as fenders
Driving like a mad dog going faster than a bullet
Pulled by gravitation from a million tons of stone
Human insects lived here crawling through the underground
Beehive built in stainless, a cathedral for the slaves
Spineless cowards guided by ideals they couldn't grasp
Giving up their freedom in the hope of being chosen
I will live forever
No angels left to hold me
I will be the final man
In the twilight grows the shadow's hollow hands that tries to catch me
Omens can not stop me because all the prophets died
Like the ancient temples their monuments survived them
Speeding through the ruins I left their bridges burning
I will live forever
No angels left to hold me
I will be the final man"b"I find myself inside a church deserted by the priests

In the morning paper

And they touch my skin
I'm on your screen
And you are just so wide
Put us on display for everyone to see

Though I get my kicks
It's slowly wasting me
Don't try to be an artist
I try to be a man
Dead stars still burn
Dead still stars burn
We find ourselves
In pictures on the net
Blinded by science
Addicted to devotion
I'm in your hold
Eager to abuse
My favourite game
I suffer from misuse
I just want to know
The man in front of them
To read their minds
For me to understand
Though I get my kicks
It's slowly wasting me

By the wailing wall of sound
Like diamonds in the ground
We are waiting to be found
In silence we are bound
By the wailing wall of sound

With our primal screams that echoes back inside
Want to pierce the noise and make our voices heard
To the distant shapes that wonders who we are

As our ashes turn to dust

Beating like a bass drum time goes by
I want the last dance just like you
Drowning in the flood of morning light

By helicopter to the sky
I laughed at gravitation
For a moment I was free
They say I never landed
You know they may be right
It looks better from above
With some distance in between
To leave is never easy
Perhaps it shouldn't be
But return is even harder
Yes, return is harder still
I often dream of flying
Far above the city streets
I beat my wings and leave
For Cairo or New York
To leave is never easy
Perhaps it shouldn't be
But return is even harder
Yes, return is harder still
I can go to many places
But there's no one there to meet
And the sky is a lonely place
Just me and the silent clouds
To leave is never easy
Perhaps it shouldn't be
But return is even harder
Yes, return is harder still"b"Monochrome reflections climbing up the walls
Down below your radar things are going on
All along the tunnels through the underground
We prepare for leaving waiting for the moon
Beats above your highness coded to be safe
Round and round in circles we are coming out
Dance away the meters through the muddy waters
We are submariners close to foreign shores
Pride in sleepy hollows doesn't make us happy
We are modern prophets amplified by you
Scientific networks spies behind the curtain
We defend the future and give it back to you
Break the loop of habit time for your return

Hello

Hello
Hear me out
The satellites are out tonight
New-born stars
Tied and bound
Seduced by pride and want

I remember nothing of the journey, and there's no one else around.
I cut down across the towering dunes to see the seagulls glide above.
So graceful when they are silent like lonely white ghosts in the air.
I noticed they're all unique with faces that are all their own.
Born to kiss a turbulent sky before they collapse and die.
I noticed they're all unique with faces that are all their own.
Born to kiss a turbulent sky before they collapse and die.
As I look and dream myself away, a sound is loud enough to hear,
Like disembodied, friendly voices carried on by southbound winds.
I wake up to the sound of silence, it's wasn't faint and far away,
Like the finest spray of water, they still speak of things I know.
I turn to fix my eyes on the horizon, and I face the freezing gale.
I observe the majestic wide waves as they rise and break and fall.
I noticed they're all unique with faces that are all their own.
Born to kiss a turbulent sky before they collapse and die.
I noticed they're all unique with faces that are all their own.
Born to kiss a turbulent sky before they collapse and die.
While they rise into the wild wind that picks them up before they strike,
Steals away their urgent faces, lifts the spirits to the skies.
And the language, soft and broken, but still, I understand it well.
We talk about the ones we care for and of all the things we lost.
I noticed they're all unique with faces that are all their own.
Born to kiss a turbulent sky before they collapse and die.
I noticed they're all unique with faces that are all their own.
Born to kiss a turbulent sky before they collapse and die.
Born to kiss a turbulent sky before they collapse and die."b"Stand before the gates and watch metropolis
Empires come and go, we live forever
And eternity is in your hidden eyes
Take my broken wings, teach me to fly again
I stand alone, we stand alone
I stand alone, we stand alone
Down the empty streets, head for the seven hills
Vestal virgins dance, we steal the fire
Battered columns stand as silent monuments
Deep inside their dreams I see your memories
I stand alone, we stand alone
I stand alone, we stand alone
I stand alone, we stand alone
We share the last champagne and watch necropolis
Still and so let's leave her to her silent walks
The sun of Rome is set and our day is gone
A kiss, a taste of red from your open lips
I stand alone, we stand alone
I stand alone, we stand alone
I stand alone, we stand alone
I stand alone, we stand alone
We stand alone
We stand alone
We stand alone
We stand alone
Alone"b"A billion words ago
The sailors disappeared
A story for the children
To rock them back to sleep
A million burning books
Like torches in our hands
A fabric of ideals
To decorate our homes
A thousand generations
The soil on which we walk
A mountain of mistakes
For us to climb for pleasure
A hundred clocks are ticking
The line becomes a circle
Spin the wheel of fortune
Or learn to navigate
A choir full of longing
Will call our ships to port
The countless lonely voices
Like whispers in the dark
A second of reflection can
Take you to the moon
The slightest hesitation can
Bring you down in flames
A single spark of passion
Can change a man forever
A moment in a lifetime
Is all it takes to break him
A fraction of a heartbeat
Made us what we are
A brother and a sister
For better or for worse
A billion words ago
They sang a song of leaving
An echo from the chorus
Will call them back again
A choir full of longing
Tonight we light the fires
We call our ships to port
Tonight we walk on water
And tomorrow we'll be gone"b"I ride the morning train; eople come and go.
So many different faces as the city passes by.
I watch their tired eyes; journeys never made.
Broken dreams of leaving fill the streets with dust.
This is our final journey; it's the end of the line.
Constantly in transit, we just want to go home.
The rain that falls for weeks, painting pictures on the streets,
Twisted stars beneath my feet, I cruise the crowd.
I could be one of them, going back and forth,
Between familiar places, as my blood turns cold.
I watch with gypsy eyes: secrets never told.
Stolen years of yearning turn their tears to dust.
This is our final journey; it's the end of the line.
Constantly in transit, we just want to go home.
The rain that falls for weeks, painting pictures on the streets,
Twisted stars beneath my feet, I cruise the crowd.
The rain that falls for weeks, painting pictures on the streets,
Twisted stars beneath my feet, I cruise the crowd.
The rain that falls for weeks, painting pictures on the streets,
Twisted stars beneath my feet, I cruise the crowd."b"Use me use me use me
I'm here dont go
don't keep talking talking talking
never speek the word i know
failed to save you
failed to know you"b"I'm lost to the world soon to be forgotten
Living in the shadows, searching for belief
But my anger is gone and the anvil is broken
The pieces on the ground melting in the silence
I keep my head above the surface
Trying to breathe
Looking for land
I keep an eye at the distant horizon
Waiting for help
Clutching the sky
My fear is my cross, heavy on my shoulders
Learning to be patient, burning to be free
So my spirit is strong but my body is broken
My father in the fire, dying for survival"b"I don't want to let you go before I understand
I don't want to let you go to the no man's land
I don't want to let you go, I want to hold your hand
I don't want to let you go to the no man's land"b'We are the men
Silent and cold
Beautiful eyes
Sheep among wolves
We are the men
Silent and strong

Sheep among wolves'b"I'm falling out of cars
Don't know when I'll hit the ground
Hold me when I fall
Headlights in my face
My body's full of scars
Words are lost and won't be found
Stay until I'm gone
Stumbling on my knees
I'm dancing in the dark
Shrinking cities feel the sound
Hear the silent hum
Searchlights in the skies
I'm blinded by the stars
There is darkness all around
Hold me when I cry
Those were all my days
I'm falling out of cars
Hanging on the windscreen
Blinded by the headlights
I'm killing ground
I'm dancing in the dark
Stumbling on the highway
Guided by the city light
I'm lost and found
I'm falling out of cars
Don't know when I'll hit the ground
Hold me when I fall
Headlights in my face
I'm dancing in the dark
Shrinking cities feel the sound
Hear the distant hum
Searchlights in my eyes
I never took the time
I should have told you then
I never found the time
Falling out of cars
I'm falling out of cars
Hanging on the windscreen
Blinded by the headlights
I'm killing ground
I'm dancing in the dark
Stumbling on the highway
Guided by the city light
I'm lost and found
I'm falling out of cars
Hanging on the windscreen
Blinded by the headlights
I'm killing ground
(repeat of chorus)"b'You burn the ground to hold your position
You ran away if I came too close
You kept track of balance and pressure
All the dreams and desires
I want some more
Red
Black
For the jackpot
Take you down
I want to take you down
I want to take you down with me
We had the motion we had the grace
We had a sense of time and place
We wrote the rules we played the game
And it would never (ever) be the same
It was the beauty while we played
We played to win but no one did
We grew old we moved ahead
From dance hall days for higher stakes'b"I'm tricked by your smile
Want to be forgiven
Waiting for the battle
Aching for belief
But your answer is wrong
And my spirit is broken
Like choirs in the winter
Singing out of key
I am silent
Invisible to you
While I count the days gone by
I am silent
Invisible to you
While I shape the things to come
I am silent
Invisible to you
While I count the days gone by
I try so hard
To fight for an illusion
Holding my breath
Biting my tongue
I try to cope
So give me a reason
I'm waiting for help
I'm trapped by my guilt
Want to be forgotten
Tired of the noise
Aching for relief
But your anger is gone
And my silence is golden
Like fires on the water
Drifting out of reach
I am silent
Invisible to you
While I count the days gone by
I am silent
Invisible to you
While I shape the things to come
I am silent
Invisible to you
While I count the days gone by
I am silent
Invisible to you
While I count the days gone by
I am silent
Invisible to you
While I shape the things to come
I am silent
Invisible to you
While I count the days gone by"b'This is the sound of our days
Burning the light of our nights
This is the sign of our times
From my mouth into your eyes
This is the beat of our praise
Setting the pace of our stride
This is the line that we cross
With my torch I light your way
When the time is right
We raise our heads and look
When the bridges burn
We leave our homes in flames
This is the noise of our blood
Telling the age of our nerves
This is the price of our lies
From my lips into your breath
This is the voice of our past
Turning the tide of our lives
These are the tears that we cry
With my tongue I touch your mind
When the time is right
We raise our heads and look
When the bridges burn
We leave our homes in flames
When the time is right
We raise our heads and look
When the bridges burn
We leave our homes in flames'b"I watch minutes grow to hours and how seasons build the ages
Every winter dies in sunlight only to be born again
And the rainfall feeds the forests while the lightning strikes the trees
Turning giants into dust, fertile ashes on the ground
I see them going down to the water
Where they embrace the silent waves
Slowly they're swallowed by the water
And their breath ascending to the sky
I see them now floating in the water
Carried away, carried away
I see wasteland turn into gardens watching oceans giving birth
To fragile little creatures born to grow and multiply
And the children of the children of the firstborn claims the land
Building fences for protection from their brothers' greedy grasp
I watch kingdoms rise and crumble and the nations come and go
Only new names for the same things once the limit has been reached
Now I see them lose their interest in the deeds that have been done
And the wisdom that's been found as they return to whence they came"b"Ladies and gentlemen lights are going out let's sleep outside and watch the city sleep
Listen and remember wait another day we are explorers far away from home
Stay for just a moment watch the natives dance be civilized and kiss the pretty bride
Brothers and sisters the pain is gone for now let's burn our books and find a little peace
Sooner or later we walk another day we are colliders everywhere we go
Stay for just a car-crash know your heart is weak be primitive and wave your love good bye
Ladies and gentlemen lights are going out let's sleep outside and watch the city sleep
Preachers and sinners we are all the same let's save ourselves and drink from deeper wells
Hatred and compassion wail against the walls we are invaders trying to escape
Fight for just a lifetime count the moments lost be so alive and cry as time goes by
Ladies and gentlemen lights are going out let's step outside and watch the city sleep
Greater than the sun
We are greater than the sun"b"I find myself inside a church deserted by the priests
As shadows shift from gray to red I notice there's no floor
Transparent air suspends my weight as if I had no mass
Then suddenly the moon comes out from the clouded skies
Wet and cold from shifting daydreams wakeful in the sleep
Windowpane observing some commotion down below
Waiting for the noise to come to blur the weary mind
Watching as a pastime and I'm the fallen star
(Go film) We can all be gods
(Go film) We will all be heroes
(Go film) We are all immortal
(Go film) We will all be safe
(Go film) We are all illusions
(Go film) And we never touch
(Go film) Go film
I will shine again with burning light when I return
In and out from foreign shores I've gone astray in time
Born to search for something I have never ever seen
On an endless quest to hostile ground and unknown lands
Then the scene go back to where it started and I fall
As shadows shift from red to gray I notice there's no floor
And gravity awakes me as it throws me to the ground
A million tiny grains of dust obscures me from your eyes
(Go film) We can all be gods
(Go film) We will all be heroes

Shelters for the vultures hardly keeping daylight out
Marble stained with rust, faded paintings on the walls
Beaten towers crumble, haunted only by the wind
I will live forever
No angels left to hold me
I will be the final man
Picking up the given challenge of the fallen gargoyle angels
Headed on collision course with martyrs tied as fenders
Driving like a mad dog going faster than a bullet
Pulled by gravitation from a million tons of stone
Human insects lived here crawling through the underground
Beehive built in stainless, a cathedral for the slaves
Spineless cowards guided by ideals they couldn't grasp
Giving up their freedom in the hope of being chosen
I will live forever
No angels left to hold me
I will be the final man
In the twilight grows the shadow's hollow hands that tries to catch me
Omens can not stop me because all the prophets died
Like the ancient temples their monuments survived them
Speeding through the ruins I left their bridges burning
I will live forever
No angels left to hold me
I will be the final man"b'I try to rise in pride, I want to radiate
Walk on water and ride the light
I try to break to chains, I want to penetrate
Cross the borders and drink the oceans
Give me velocity and gasoline
Electricity and adrenaline
I want to be superluminal
I need to burn my fuel, I want to detonate
Melt the sun and drain the sources
I need to waste my strength, I want to escalate
Turn the tide, conquer the stars
Given velocity and gasoline
Electricity and adrenaline
I want to be superluminal'b"My eyes grow darker
Can barely see your face
Yesterday I tried to belong
You know I won't stay that long
In a time of lust and liars
I learned to trust my own desires
Touch me, don't be ashamed
I just don't know how to play that game
In pride and grace, we rise with the sun
With the morning light, we just run and run
The good old days, that imaginary place
With the rising sun, we forget and we embrace
My eyes grow darker, guide me now
Can barely see your face, just lead the way
My eyes grow darker, guide me now
Can barely see your face, just lead the way
My days grow longer
Can barely find my trace
One more day I try to be strong
You know I won't last that long
For a time I feed the fires
I search and seek while time expires
Hold me, I'm so afraid
I just don't know how to keep this flame
In pride and grace, we rise with the sun
With the morning light, we just run and run
The good old days, that imaginary place
With the rising sun, we forget and we embrace
My eyes grow darker, guide me now
Can barely see your face, just lead the way
My eyes grow darker, guide me now
Can barely see your face, just lead the way
My eyes grow darker, guide me now
Can barely see your face, just lead the way
My eyes grow darker, guide me now
Can barely see your face, just lead the way"b'one world one sky

It's hunting season urbanised, I wish I could be there
Warmth and laughter, the right amount of danger

But it's pouring down with rain
Do you remember?
Are you alive?
Do you still speak of deeds undone?
But it's pouring down with rain
Do you remember?
Are you alive?
Do you still speak of deeds undone?
I used to be immortal, I was innocent as a child
my vision was unlimited, I saw rivers on the Moon
I had important things to say, can't remember what they were
Of all the things I did, none had been done before
But achievements never last
Do you recall?
Do you dream?
Do you still need company?
But achievements never last
Do you recall?
Do you dream?
Do you still need company?
I had a friend who knew the language of the future
I'm told he lost his mind, they say he went away
Navigating empty streets astray among the lost
A shadow in the corner of a stranger's eye
But there's nothing left to learn
Do you count the years?
Do you breathe?
Do you still watch the sunrise?
But there's nothing left to learn

I think you're not on my side
I think I made a mistake
You try to sneak behind my back
But trust can not be stolen
Friendship must be earned and affection's not for sale
I know you want respect
But contempt is all you get from me
We are forever unforgiven
You call me a traitor
But you are a snake
An eye for an eye
And a tooth for a tooth
I think you are in too deep
I think you're not what you seem
I think I have been a fool
I think I should take more care"b'We make ritual noise

counting and weighing the amount of our breaths

by learning the fear and gaining our composure
content at the surface descension to come
peace in aloneness although all will be lost

I'm a multitude of travels to the other side
Through the broken wall, I saw your fellow man
To the west of the horizon there is a bitter wind
And if you try to sense the smell of your face
For you found the keyhole, but you lost your backbone
No courage left to join the march of endless time
You saw the sleep of habit on those who walk in trance
To their catatonic aimless lives
I see the stalker in your face, the secrets on your skin
I keep the wisdom that you need, the password that you want
I feel the stalker in your mind, the fire in your veins
No hope to be released
I see the stalker in your face, the secrets on your skin
I keep the wisdom that you need, the password that you want
I feel the stalker in your mind, the fire in your veins
No hope to be released
So let them start the engine, grinding mountain dust
And reproduce your ego, too much is not enough
You dig holes through the earth to meet the king of worms
To steal away his wisdom and learn to decompose
You chant like fifty Indians, to charm the prince of eagles
To learn the art of seeing and the tongue of the winds
So don't you try to fool me, for I watch your every move
We are kindred spirits, like two voices in the wild
I see the stalker in your face, the secrets on your skin
I keep the wisdom that you need, the password that you want
I feel the stalker in your mind, the fire in your veins
No hope to be released
I see the stalker in your face, the secrets on your skin
I keep the wisdom that you need, the password that you want
I feel the stalker in your mind, the fire in your veins
No hope to be released"b"we wish so hard to be seen
and pray at night to be heard
and yet we have nothing to show
but false words and broken dreams
I'm the figurehead on the ship of fools
a beacon for the liars in the dark
I'm the first and the last I claim this land
I'm the lost and the hungry I need this land
the inescapable face of truth
spins my head again
disturbingly unable to stand back
I'm going down
the undeniable sense of wonder
kicks my head in
disturbingly unable to escape
I dive to drown
we want so hard to be true
and claim the right to be good
and yet we never seem to know
how to reach the promised lands
we work so hard to be wise
and dream of light to be pure
we need brighter death to grow
the clean touch of virgin hands"b'reach beyond the constellations
a movement towards the monumental
universal secrets - the cosmic error
sculptured by those dying generations
...I drank the passions of those lost in the paradox...
as the stars touched my essence
the last of all creation wept
paralysed with wonder and confusion
blurred by the serpents temptation
...I drank the passions of those lost in the paradox...
entangled in a swirling black aura of united burning chaos
anthems to the forgotten masters - a gathering equilibrium
"reach beyond the constellations
a movement towards the monumental
universal secrets - the cosmic error

I knew... as I beheld the cosmos about me
compelled towards the spiritual black dimensions aura

lies the Ocean of Impurity
a ship made of angels' hair
set sails on the morning tide
in my Heaven of Despair
blows the Wind of Insanity

with sails made of golden pride

I watch myself in the boiling sea
so if you are a man
prepare yourself for joining me

Cursed were the minions rebellion, An image of the serpents creation
Reveal and enter the passage, enter into the phantoms fire
Constellation, a unity in chaos the chariots of thunder's arrival
Sent fragments of my reflection to the void afire
Behold the new breed created in my own image
Brighter these eyes burned with wicked anticipation
As the struggle for the black elements came to an end
A precious mingling of the flesh and alien fire
Held dreaming hands beneath the power to universal creation
Became the utter perfection of total completion
Breathe the untouched majesty of dark emotions
And feel the power, the beauty of domination
Conquering the weavers Utopia, conquering
To see them in such swarms
I wondered if this could be paradise
A seed for the future
The fire of fate and faith set alight
Behold the faithless and his angel"b'so I reach inside the raging galaxy

my grave rose to the west...
for centuries long forgotten,
relentless as the hungry gates of dawn.

of stones and earthly flesh,
...I laughed and served a sulphur feast.
and still it haunts me...

I striked at the sun,

gobbling, gobbling...
I devoured the stars,
my universe torn asunder.

derived from mortal men,
...caught between two paralells of death.'b"I feel too many affectious obstacles
water must be allowed to seek it's own level
I don't seek to strive on others' expense
and the expense is mine as they judge my ways
I'm waiting for the rain to fall for days
I'm longing for the flood to sweep this all away
to grind the mountains to the level of the valleys
to cut the trees to the level of the grass
to asphalt the land in the name of equality
let us grow in mutual respect and care
I will transgress the laws and change the orders
to live within an environment of my choice

don't stand in the shadow of my hammer"b'the shattering of old illusions - created new surges of chaos
no longer driven by ancient hungers - I grabbed the poisened chalice
clawing at the churning night - thus rose my cosmic ambitions
riding the snake in divine rebellion - wandering the nebular centuries
the precious ones
brought the planetary elements apart
leading the universe
towards new and possessive aeons
these toughs and emotions equaled the night
revealed in the starborn cataclysmic attributes
like monuments of unaging intellect
seeking the sight - in shining dreamlike presence

side by side... entangled in the complete"

Walking in a winter wonderland
Gone away is the bluebird
Here to stay is a new bird

Stopped off at the North Pole to spend a holiday
I called on dear old Santa Claus
To see what I could see
He took me to his workshop
And told his plans to me. So
[Chorus]
You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
He's making a list and checking it twice
Gonna find out who's naughty and nice
Santa Claus is comin' to town
He sees you when you're sleepin'
He knows when you're a wake
He knows if you've been bad or good
So be good for goodness sake
Oh! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
With little tin horns and little toy drums
Rooty toot toots and rummy tum tums
Santa Claus is comin' to town
And curly head dolls that toddle and coo
Elephants, boats, and kiddie cars too
Santa Claus is comin' to town
Then kids in Girl and Boy land will have a jubilee
They're gonna build a Toyland all around the Christmas tree
So! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
Now Santa is a busy man, He has no time to play
He's got millions of stockings to fill on Christmas day
You'd better write your letter now
And mail it right away
Because he's getting ready
His reindeers and his sleigh. So

With little tin horns and little toy drums
Rooty toot toots and rummy tum tums
Santa Claus is comin' to town
And curly head dolls that toddle and coo

They're gonna build a Toyland all around the Christmas tree

And may all your Christmases be white
I'm dreaming of a white Christmas
With every Christmas card I write
May your days be merry and bright

Als ik alleen ben
Niet meer weet wat ik moet doen
Dan drink ik veel dan wordt het laat
Dan wil ik dat je voor me staat
Ik vertel je dat het niet meer gaat
En dan geef je mij een zoen
En dan zing ik
Een mooi liedje
Mooi liedje
Mooi liedje voor jou
Ik rook
Mijn laatste peuk weg
En daarna moet ik naar bed
Om na een uur weer op te staan
Om weer naar buiten toe te gaan
Dat ik ons dit heb aangedaan
Ik hoop dat jij je redt
En dan zing ik
Een mooi liedje
Mooi liedje
Mooi liedje voor jou
Vannacht
Als ik alleen ben
Wanneer ik huil om jou
Dan drink ik veel vervagen dingen
Niet in staat me te bedwingen
Wil ik alleen mijn pijn bezingen
En daarom zing ik nou'b"Ik zie twee mensen op het strand
Vlakbij het water, hand in hand
De zon zakt, ze zwijgen van geluk
Ik ken haar net, want dat ben jij
Ze lacht naar hem, hij lijkt op mij
Maar dat kan niet (want) ik maak alles stuk
Ik kan die jongen toch nooit zijn
Die rust, die liefde, niets voor mij
Maar waarom lijkt het dan toch zo vertrouwd?
Ik heb je lief zoals je ziet
Maar ergens klopt er hier iets niet
Ik draag een ring maar 'k heb jou nooit getrouwd
Ik ben mezelf niet
Of al die jaren nooit geweest
Ik ben de gangmaker op het verkeerde feest
Ik ben mezelf niet of nooit geweest
Ik ben mezelf niet of nooit geweest
Ik zie twee mensen, ze gaan staan
Zij draait zich om, we moeten gaan
Kijk in haar ogen en zie dezelfde pijn
Twee mensen eerder al verbonden
Al die verliefdheid, wat een zonde
We zij het allebei maar willen het niet zijn
Ik ben mezelf niet
Of al die jaren nooit geweest
Ik ben de schoenmaker bij de verkeerde leest
Ik ben mezelf niet of nooit geweest
Ik ben mezelf niet of nooit geweest
Oehoehoehoe, oh laat het de zon zijn
(laat het de zon zijn)
Oh laat het het strand zijn
Laat het de zee zijn
Laat mij iets doen nu
Waardoor je mij nooit meer wilt zien
Oh Laat het het zout zijn
(laat het de zon zijn)
Laat het mijn allerdomste fout zijn
Maar laat me dit nooit meer vergeten,
Nooit meer vergeten
Laat me dit nooit meer vergeten bovendien
Ik ben mezelf niet of al die jaren nooit geweest
Ik ben mezelf niet of al die jaren nooit geweest
Ik ben mezelf niet of nooit geweest
Ik ben mezelf niet of nooit geweest
Ik ben mezelf niet of nooit geweest
(of al die jaren nooit geweest)
Ik ben mezelf niet of nooit geweest
(of al die jaren nooit geweest)"b"Vannacht lag ik weer wakker mam
Om alles wat ik niet weet
En voor niets had ik een oplossing
Behalve dan me reet
Niet dat het me niet interesseert
Maar wat weet ik er nou van
Soms dacht ik: 'stel nou dat...'
En dat was het wel weer dan
Vannacht lag ik weer wakker mam
Ben het bed maar uitgegaan
En alsof ik niet genoeg shit had
De radio aangedaan
De hele nacht de Beatles mam
En om elk uur dat woord
Het spijt me mam het spijt me zo
John Lennon is vermoord
De zoon van god was terug op aarde mam
Zelfde boodschap zelfde haar
En All You Need Is Love, zo mooi
Maar kennelijk niet waar
Laat me slapen
Laat me slapen
Laat me slapen
Laat me slapen
Vanochtend toen de krant kwam
Heb ik de oplossing bedacht
En ik heb hem terug gegeven
Ik heb hem teruggegeven
Aan de jongen die hem bracht
En toen pas kwam ik langs die zin
Die wel de waarheid raakt:
'Het leven is wat je gebeurt
Terwijl je andere plannen maakt'
De zoon van god was terug op aarde mam
En Imagine was zijn woord
Dus de wereld is een paradijs
En dat 'ie dude is heb denk ik niet gehoord"b"Op een terras, ergens in Frankrijk in de zon,
zit een man die het tot gisteren nooit won.
Maar z'n auto vloog hier vlakbij uit de bocht.
Zonder hem, zonder Herman, want die had hem net verkocht.
Herman in de zon op het terras,
leest in 't AD dat-ie niet meer in leven was.
Z'n auto was volledig afgebrand
en de man die hem gekocht had, stond onder zijn naam in de krant.
[chorus]
Oh-ho-ho, even rustig ademhalen,
oh-ho-ho, 't lijkt of het regent als altijd.
Maar het regent, en het regent zonnestralen.
Een week geleden in een park in Amsterdam,
had-ie z'n leven overzien en schrok zich lam.
Hij was een man wiens leven nu al was bepaald
en van al z'n jongensdromen, was alleen het oud worden gehaald.
[chorus]
Op een bankje, in het park, kwam het besluit.
Noem het dapper, noem het vluchten, maar ik knijp er tussenuit.
Nu een week geleden en hier zat ie dan maar weer,
met meer vrijheid dan hem lief was en nou wist-ie het niet meer.
Herman leest wel honderd keer de krant.
Het staat er echt, pagina 18, zwart omrand.
Hield-ie vroeger al zijn meningen en al zijn dromen stil,
nu is-ie niks, niet, niemand, nergens meer,
kan dus gaan waar-ie maar wil.
Herman rekent af en staat dan op.
Hij heeft eindelijk de wind weer in z'n kop,
Ik heb een tweede kans gekregen en da's meer dan ik verdien.
Maar als dit 't is, is dit 't (3x)
en we zullen het wel zien.
[chorus 2x]"b"Michelangelo, Shredder, Peter Venkman, Zuel

Friends are waiting down the hall
She takes my hand she won't let go

Some will say that it kills
Pain or pleasure pop the pills
So cold, so lonely and so cold

Take cover, Take cover, Torture Chamber, it's cold
Got so many bills to pay
Baby still wants to play
Friends are waiting in the car

I feel so empty, we should land

Sitting in the bathroom stall

There must be a reason why you put my life in ovexdrive.
I'm up to here with push and shove
From here on in - I've had enough -
Don't count on me -
I'll leave it all behind in a cloud of dust
There's an even chance I'll shine or bust.

There's a light ahead at the end of the line.

You say you're fine but I know better
'Cause you would never act that way.
If something wasn't wrong
if something wasn't out of control
And though you don't seem all
that different than everybody else I know
Coming from you
that's nothing but strange behavior
What you're going through
causing that strange behavior - so strange !
Something isn't right
something's got you under it's spell
And I would not be so suspicious if I didn't laiow you so well.
You might as well confess
you know that I'm gonna find out
So just don't keep on acting
like you don't know what I'm talking about.
Coming from you
that's nothing but strange behavior

It's so strange - you don't even talk to me

If you never give him room
you're gonna lose.
He's feeling like he's tied up in a knot
Ev'ry time he comes home late he's on the spot.
Trust him to be the kind of man he wants to be
You aren't gonna keep him long if you give him
the third degree.
Let him go
let him go
do the things he's got to do
Give him the freedom that he needs even though it worries you.
Let him go
let him go
have the faith that he'll be true
It's the only way you can be sure he'll come back to you.
You want your life with him to work so well
You forget the love you need to give yourself.
I understand your desire to keep him near
But you poison love when you mix it up with fear.
Trust yourself to be the woman that you want to be
If you both have room to grow
then you'll live in harmony.
Let him go
let him go
do the things he's got to do

Let him go

I cannot sleep
I am a possession unopened at your feet.
There's no balance
No equality
Be still
I will not accept defeat.
I will have you
Yes
I will have you
I will find a way and I will have you.
Like a butterfly
A wild butterfly
I will collect you and capture you.
You are an obsession
You're my obsession
Who do you want me to be to make you sleep with me?
You are an obsession
You're my obsession
Who do you want me to be to make you sleep with me?
I feed you and drink you by day and by night.
I need you
I need you by sun and candle light.
You protest
You want to leave.
Stay
Oh
There's no alternative.
You see some beauty here
I see some beauty there
But I see danger
Stranger beware.
A circumstance
When you make your dreams
Your affection is not what it seems.
You are an obsession
You're my obsession...
My fantasy has turned to madness
And all my goodness has turned to badness.
My need to possess you has consumed my soul.
My life is trembling
I have no control!
I will have you
Yes
I will have you...
You are an obsession
You're my obsession...
You are an obsession
You're my obsession...
You are an obsession
You're my obsession..."b"Time and time again I keep trying to put you out of my mind
I can't concentrate
you're the only feeling I can find.
And it's taking over
rolling me over
seems like it won't stop
And I've lost control of my heart and soul.
'Cause when I see your eyes
then I know I want you
When I hear your voice
that's when I know I want you.
Losing all my defenses you're slipping back inside of my head
It's getting so I can't exist
without the thought of us together again.
And it's taking over
rolling me over
seems like it won't stop
. . .
When I feel your touch
then I know I want you
Then I know I want you
I want you!
In my life it's been so uncertain
Ties were broken and it left me hurting
Maybe now I can trust again with you.
And it's taking over
rolling me over
seems like it won't stop

When I feel your touch
then I know I want you
Then I know I want you
I want you !
'Cause when I see your eyes
then I know I want you
When I hear your voice

When I feel your touch

Then I know I want you
I want you !"b"Broken into pieces
My disease is
That I care.
About the world, and the people living in the world.
Show me pictures of starving children
I get angry, then change the station
Still more picture of starving children
I get angry, then I get hungry
When I worked for UNICEF
It seemed to be the way, for Jesus to get my autograph
I sing their tears away.
Choking, over treacle.
They cannot hear from over there
We made a movie, then shot the sequel
Documentaries, 'cos we care.
Cue the pictures of starving children
Change the angle, change location
Still more victims like dying children
Nominate me for an Elie
Then we posed for photographs
Everyone was brave
A smile, a hug, and gentle laugh
Will feed their pain away
Words on broken phonographs
Reeking with decay
Close our eyes to circumstance
Hope it goes away
I'm Broken, Broken
We're Broken, Broken..."b"Sweet 70's innovation
Holds the golden key to my inspiration
Free 70s generation
It's in the air I breathe at this elevation
Music now, was music then
I have a chance all over again
To make it loud, make it clear
All the distance disappears
Street felony, instigation
It's inner city heat across every station
Beat melody combinations
In every word I say
Of my conversation
I use it now, I used it then
When discotheque was my best friend
I boomed it loud, I made it clear
I rearranged my atmosphere
Sweet melody
Street felony
A New Energy
When the crowd, gets in your ear
It permeates your atmosphere
But think it loud, think it clear
Ignorance will disappear
Sweet
Sweet
Sweet"b"You're the hole in my umbrella
The soaking wet behind my ears
The bloodstain on my name
The same disease I've had for years
If I went to see the doctor
He would say to stay away
But why should I heed advice? (The hospital charges twice)
When it's possible to feel worse
Sid and Nancy, loved each other
I want you to be my Undercutter
We'll watch the stars, lying in the gutter
I need you to be my Undercutter
Jezebel of my novella
We're soaking wet between the sheets
These feelings never change (I'm happy to be deranged)
Without you I'm incomplete"b"Once upon a time, I used to be a Socialist
Until they ran out, of room for a vocalist
Community, we share and share alike
How can I share, what isn't mine?
I can't share, what isn't mine...
I can't spare, what isn't mine
Once I flew a plane to the land of philanthropy
Until it crashed down in a sea of apathy
In unity, we live until we die
Why should I bear.. what isn't mine?
I can't bear.. what isn't mine
I shouldn't bear what isn't mine
One hungry son of a bitch
Super-sperm with a ten inch dick
International, top of the list
I've go the world by its balls"b"Well if you could change the season
Maybe I would get out of bed
I don't need much of a reason
To wanna be, out there instead
We're shacking up
My bills are stacking up
You should be packing up
Before I'm cracking up
Every year comes the first of June
My whole world confines to a room
In my dreams, I live on the moon
But my eyes come awake to soon..."b"Soaked yourself beneath my skin
I don't know why I don't when
But you're burning my eyes again.
I stumble through the doorway
I fall to my floor-way
Time stands still
As I lay here suffering.
A sacrifice for all your sins
You bleed me now, you bled me then
But I'm hanging around again.
I scramble to the driveway
Then blackout on the highway
Time stands still
And I lay here wondering...
Does it ever get any better?
Does it get much worse with soap?
I followed you down to the letter
But still I got no hope
Playing a game I'll never win
There's no way to save my skin
Because you're burning me on purpose
Epidermis
Is scarring from the charring
Full of cuts and lacerations
That keep me suffering.
Does it ever get any better?
Does it get much worse with rope?
I followed you down to the letter.
Still I've got no hope.

I think it's crystal clear
What I want from you
It's obvious that you want me too
Is it dangerous
For the two of us
To feel this good?
It's the only reason why I think we should
So what's in our way? What's in our way?
The Libertines live for today
For today........
When you're lying near
My panic disappears
What you've given me
Changes my identity
We're delirious
As they envy us
We're misunderstood
You're the only reason why I thought I could
So let's run away, let's run away
I wouldn't waste another day
Run away...."b'The time is 8:09
I\'m running to the line
The one that takes me down
Down to Chinatown...
There\'s shouting in the streets
A pattering of feet
Intrigue is everywhere
Total chaos...
Chinese restaurant
We\'re meeting here tonight,
We \'ll say goodbye
For one more time
Chinese restaurant
Keep breaking up and mending
Seems to be the pattern of your love...
A writing on the wall
A symbol tells it all
I should have known before
She was moving on...
Mysterious almond eyes
Incapable of lies
I should have known before
She was moving on...
It\'s just like a movie
We kiss and she walks away
Alone on the sidewalk
I\'m left like a fool today
It\'s just like a movie
My fortune cookie says:
"Keep on moving on your way,
She\'ll be back here once again"...'b"Every time she looks at me,
I can feel electric heat,
All right, all right,
Shiny sparkle in her eyes,
As she's moving in disguise,
All right, all night...
I am losing my control,
May be time to take a hold,
Tonight, all right,
Body spinning all around,
Don't know if I'm up or down,
I'm on fire...
Woody Woody Boogie, Woody Woody Boogie
Woody get down tonight, Woody get down tonight
We're on the go-o-o
Woody
People jumping in the air
Going crazy everywhere
All right, all right
I keep staring at her face
When the clock begins to race
All night, all night
Breaking up the night, oh-oh-oh
Shaking up the night, oh-oh-oh

Jungle life
I'm far away from nowhere
On my own like Tarzan boy
Hide and seek
I play along while rushing 'cross the forest
Monkey business on a sunny afternoon
Jungle life
I'm living in the open
Native beat that carries on
Burning bright
A fire blows the signal to the sky
I sit and wonder, does the message get to you?

It's all right
You won't miss home
Take a chance
Leave everything behind you
Come and join me, won't be sorry
It's easy to survive
Jungle life
We're living in the open
All alone like Tarzans, boy
Hide and seek
We play along while rushing 'cross the forest
Monkey business on a sunny afternoon

It's getting cold, baby
I want your hot hands on me
HOT HANDS, I need your hot hands on me
HOT HANDS, I need your hot hands on me
Our love is sweet, it might be pure
But there are some days I can't endure
Too lonely, cold, honestly
Give me those hot hands that I crave

We're not alone if we dream together
Of the good times
We got through coz we won't surrender
Head on my shoulder glass of red wine
If we left the night behind
We have won this already
La la la li, la la la li
I watched you reach for the sky
La la la li, la la la li
Chrysalis to butterfly
Sometimes
You don't win gold, you don't win silver
At the right time
You'll find bronze makes you the winner
Tears running freely, and I dry from your cheek
If you left the night behind
You have won this already
La la la li, la la la li
I watched you reach for the sky
La la la li, la la la li
Chrysalis to butterfly
To butterfly
Kiss your lips and watch you fly
My butterfly
Chrysalis to butterfly
It's bedtime
Emotions chase us our dreams will follow
It's a good time mmmmm
For me to give you the strength I borrowed
Sigh when I hold you
Last drop of wine
If you left the night behind
I have won this already"b"So, what's it all about?
I can't work you out
There's a chemistry between us, getting hard to disguise
Still you're holding back
Some kind of panic attack
Treading water when you really should be turning the tide
Don't spend a lifetime waiting
Don't tell me no, just let go
If you want it, then you've got it
Don't let this moment pass you by
Take a long shot, and give it all you got
You'll never know unless you try
You can only sink or swim
Baby, just dive in
So what's the worst thing
That could be happening?
You test the water, and you find that it's a little too hot
But I'm imagining
The taste of salt on your skin
Make your move, you've gotta choose, are you ready or not?
Don't waste a lifetime waiting
You know it's now, so turn around
If you want it, then you've got it
Don't let this moment pass you by
Take a long shot, and give it all you got
You'll never know unless you try
You can only sink or swim
Baby, just dive in
Just dive in, just dive in, let's dive in
Into the blue, into the deep, into the mood tonight, dive in
If you want it, then you've got it
Don't let this moment pass you by
Take a long shot, and give it all you got
You'll never know unless you try
You can only sink or swim
Baby, just dive in
Come with me, let's dive in."b"He tells you when,
He tells you why,
He tells you wherefore -
What to do and how it's done,
And how to be for him -
It's all about control,
It's all about control.
You're his life,
You're his strength,
But he's you're weakness,
He knows you care,
Knows you give,
But he couldn't care less -
He fits you to his mould,
Chipping at you soul...
CHORUS
It tears me up
To see the way that he treats you,
To see the way that he brings you
down and down -
He's turning you inside out,
It breaks me up
To see the way that you take it,
To see the way that he spins you
round and round
Turning you upside down...
Mockingbird,
Mockingbird...
Afraid to leave,
Afraid to lose,
Afraid of living -
You turn to him,
You turn to me,
But it lies in you -
It's waiting to be found,
It's waiting to be found,
So feel your heart,
Feel your pain,
Feel your anger,
If you fight the fear,
find the words -
You'll find the answer...
Like a cat held upside down,
You'll land feet on the ground...
[Chorus]
You never know
What life will bring -
Trust your spirit
Find your wings,
Find your voice
And let it sing
Let it sing..."b'I love you, you love me
But you never say that to me
I want you, you want me
So how come I don\'t believe?
It\'s in the way you kiss my face
And in your every move
Won\'t you tell me something simple like the truth
Even if it isn\'t I love you
Won\'t you let me know your heart
And lay me down, is it so hard to tell me?
"It\'s nothing, don\'t be stupid"
How come you always say that to me?
"It\'s alright, take it easy"
But easy is so hard to be
It\'s in the way you brush me by
The way that you make love
Won\'t you tell me something simple like the truth
Even if it isn\'t I love you
Won\'t you let me know your heart
And lay me down, is it so hard to tell me?
It\'s not that I\'m weak, baby, I can\'t take it
It\'s not that I\'m blind, I can see you fake it
If you only knew what I\'m going through
You\'d find the words to whisper
Or you\'d find the strength to leave
Tell me something simple like the truth
Even if it isn\'t I love you
Won\'t you let me know your heart
And lay me down, is it so hard to tell me?
Won\'t you tell me something simple like the truth
Even if it isn\'t I love you
Won\'t you let me know your heart
And lay me down, is it so hard to tell me?
Why is it so hard to tell me?
I watch you, you\'re reading
But, baby, you\'re so hard to read
I love you, you love me
But you never say that to me'b"So many times we find ourselves here -
Looking just about anywhere
But in each others eyes,
I'm wondering why...
So many chances brushed then wasted,
So many matches almost won in injury time -nobody cried...
We're kicking pieces out of each other,
Instead of kicking the pain in our hearts -
Where do we start?
Chorus
Well we can reach,
And we can climb,
And we can turn this ship around in time -
That's why I'm holding out for you
I'm not buying that it's over
You can tell me anything
But I'm not buying that it's broken.
So many fixes come too easy,
Leave us so unsatisfied -
Chasing the kite, addicted to high...
So many patches we have worn,
So many promises left still born we're so blind, we kill more than time
Intoxicated, drowning each other -
Instead of drowning the pain in our hearts...
Where do we start?
Chorus
We'll walk with innocence
We'll leave the ignorance
We'll run together, let's break this silence...
Don't wanna fight no more,
Wanna feel the light some more,
Let's run together and break this silence...
I'm holding out for you,
Reaching out for you,
No way that this is through -"b"How can I sleep tonight?
Tell me how Mars survived
Fallen with stars, she opened her arms
Venus was in my sky
How could it pass me by?
You silently served my time
Even through chains, rust and the rain
You pulled away the tide
Girl in the moon, I'm half way there
Girl in the moon, I see you everywhere
Help me find a way of falling, closer to you
Girl in the moon, girl in the moon
How could I weep tonight?
Touch and our tears collide
Gravity spins me into your wings
And covers me with your light
Girl in the moon, I'm half way there
Girl in the moon, I see you everywhere
Help me find a way of falling, closer to you
Girl in the moon, girl in the moon
You're the silent silver lining my cloud
You're the secret flame that never burns out
Pull away this veil and rise into view
Girl in the moon
I need you, I need you
Girl in the moon, I'm half way there
Girl in the moon, I see you everywhere
Help me find a way of falling, closer to you
Girl in the moon, girl in the moon
Girl in the moon, oh, girl in the moon"b'She\'s got a blind smile and a soft touch
A cute little dimple when she laughs too much
They say you fall hard when you meet her
Such is her allure
She\'s got a quick wit and a fast tongue
But she doesn\'t seem to know that she\'s the one
They say she cheats charm when she whispers
She\'s devilishly pure
You\'d see if you knew her
She doesn\'t know
But its time I told her so
[Chorus]
When I see your blushes
From a compliment of mine it touches
Something inside I\'m getting rushes
The adrenaline rushes
And I\'m fascinated
That you really don\'t know how to take it
When I look at you that way you feel naked
And I\'m so into you
I\'m getting rushes
She\'s about five nine
Got a sexy stride
With long tanned legs that she shouldn\'t hide
With a fine air of innocence
Nonchalance in every move
She\'s a sweet sensation tease temptation
She looks good enough to eat
She\'s a fallen angel with a devilish streak
And so they say
Like with like will finally meet
You\'d see if you knew her
She doesn\'t know
But its time I told her so
[Chorus]
And I like it and I want more
And I like it and I want more
And I like it and I want more
Never felt it like this before
It\'s more than adrenaline rushes
It\'s the touch and the smell of skin rushes
Some call it "love at first sight"
I call it "butterflies"
(I call it butterflies, I call it butterflies)
[Chorus]'b"I feel vulnerable, I'm scared
I hang on to every word like there's a hidden meaning
It caught me unprepared
Now I'm climbing up the wall that stands between us
I keep hoping it's my imagination
Playing tricks with my heart on this occasion
But I've just got this sinking feeling
So who's gonna drown now the dam's about to break?
Tell me if it's me, I've gotta know
I'm strong enough to tell you that it's more than I can take
I'm just hanging by a thread
Got a feeling I'm in over my head
Can't wait until tomorrow, I've gotta know tonight
I feel naked in your eyes
I'm so out of control, it feels like I'm free-wheeling
Are we running out of time?
I've gotta find a way to stop this feeling
I keep hoping it's my imagination
Playing tricks with my heart on this occasion
But I've just got this sinking feeling
So who's gonna drown now the dam's about to break?
Tell me if it's me, I've gotta know
I'm strong enough to tell you that it's more than I can take
I'm just hanging by a thread
Got a feeling I'm in over my head
Can't wait until tomorrow, I've gotta know tonight
Cause when you pull back the covers
It's one way or the other, oh yeah
It's getting closer to midnight, I've gotta go
Can't wait until tomorrow, I've gotta know
So who's gonna drown now the dam's about to break?
Tell me if it's me, I've gotta know
I'm strong enough to tell you that it's more than I can take
I'm just hanging by a thread
Got a feeling I'm in over my head
Can't wait until tomorrow, I've gotta know tonight."b"Feelin' blue
While I'm trying to forget the feeling that I miss you
Feelin' green
When the jealousy swells and it won't go away in dreams
Feelin' yellow
I'm confused inside
A little hazy but mellow
When I feel your eyes on me
Feelin' fine, sublime
When that smile of yours creeps into my mind
Nobody told me you'd feel so good
Nobody said you'd be so beautiful
Nobody warned me about your smile
You're the light, you're the light
When I close my eyes, I'm color blind
You make me color blind
Feelin' red
When you spend all your time with your friends and not me instead
Feelin' black
When I think about all the things that I feel I lack
Feelin' jaded
When it's not gone right
All the colors have faded
Then I feel your eyes on me
Feelin' fine, sublime
When that smile of yours creeps into my mind
Nobody told me you'd feel so good
Nobody said you'd be so beautiful
Nobody warned me about your smile
You're the light, you're the light
When I close my eyes I'm color blind
You make me color blind
Blinded by the light you shine
The colors fade completely
Blinded by you every time
I feel your smile defeat me
I'm color blind
I just can't deny this feeling
Nobody told me you'd feel so good
Nobody said you'd be so beautiful
Nobody warned me about your smile
You're the light, you're the light
When I close my eyes I'm color blind
Nobody told me you'd feel so good
Nobody said you'd be so beautiful
Nobody warned me about your smile
You're the light, you're the light
When I close my eyes I'm color blind
You're the light, you're the light
(You make me color blind)
When I close my eyes I'm color blind
You're the light, you're the light
(You make me color blind)
When I close my eyes I'm color blind
You're the light, you're the light
(You make me color blind)
When I close my eyes I'm color blind
I'm color blind"b"Another Friday night,
And the week is over -
Got a bottle of wine
And a meal for one,
Never could have known
She was walkin with me in the rain.
Another back to back,
Down the escalator,
Beat the sliding doors
By a twist of fate,
Than a glance behind an
evening paper -
And there she was...
Lonely's gone -
Suddenly I got this feelin,
Lonely's gone -
I spin around,
Yeah Yeah
I've left the ground,
Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah
Should I make a move?
Did she catch me falling?
What I got to lose?
Will she cut me dead?
Before I catch my breath,
Can't believe she's walking
Off my train...
Beat the sliding doors -
Is she gone? Don't lose her,
Gotta keep my head -
Someone taps my shoulder,
Then I spin around and
She's just smiling -
I guess she knows...
[Chorus]
Is this fate or happenstance?
Her design or my last chance?
I can't speak
Cos she takes my breath away...
So it's Friday night,
And the day is over,
Crack a bottle of wine,
Make a meal for two -
But there's no room on the
dining table...
Here we go, Here we go...
[Chorus]"b"I thought I knew you
Better than I knew myself girl,
I thought I found you
Hiding in the strength that's in your eyes,
But now I see you
Burning all the bridges in your world,
Now I feel you
Sinking in the quicksand of your lies
Can't you see that you're slipping away?
Can't you hear what I'm trying to say?
(You're better than that?)
[Chorus:]
Better than that
Stronger than that
(You're worth much more)
You're better than that
And you can turn back
(What's tried is torn)
Better than that
Stronger than that
(You're worth much more)
I'm telling you its killing you
It's drowning you, it's spilling you over
(What's tried is torn)
I thought you knew how
To chase away the demons of blind trust,
I thought you knew now
It's all about temptation
Changed by choice,
But girl you're crazy
You're hanging onto reasons
Turned to rust,
You're eyes are hazy,
You've gone and lost the velvet
In your voice
Can't you see that you're slipping away?
Can't you hear what I'm trying to say?
(You're better than that?)
[Chorus]
I told you once, I told you twice
I told you baby
Now there's nothing more to say
I'm missing the girl I knew,
While kissing the broken you,
But it's not up to me...
So don't back, face up to the facts
And you can turn back
You're better than that.
Better than that, stronger than that,
Wiser than that, bigger than that
You're better than the devil in you
Tellin' you how, pulling you down,
Spilling you ?????- but it's up to you"b'You said its over
I said "that\'s okay
I wasn\'t in to you anyway"
I told you "lately
You irritate me your laugh is too loud
You\'re the last girl I\'d look at
If you were in a crowd"
Could you tell?
I was lying and hiding the truth away
And what I really wanted to say
[Chorus]
Is you are incredible you are amazing
You blow my mind one of a kind
I\'m having a meltdown
You are incredible you are amazing
But sometimes telling the truth
Is easier said than done,
"don\'t leave baby"
Now that\'s what I meant to say
"My worlds not ending I\'ll be just fine"
That\'s what my mouth said
But not what I felt inside
I told you "baby,
Your not the answer to all of my prayers
\'cause I like my girlfriends in short skirts with longer hair"
Could you tell?
I was lying and hiding the truth away
And what I really wanted to say
[Chorus]
Well I said I didn\'t care about what you felt about me
Couldn\'t care less about what I said or done
I didn\'t mean it its not what I meant to say
You know the truth is that I care
About what you think about me
Maybe too much, I\'ve been puttin\' on a front
I didn\'t mean it and what I meant to say
Is you are incredible you are amazing
You blow my mind one of a kind
I\'m having a meltdown
You are incredible you are amazing
But sometimes telling the truth
Is easier said than done, yeah yeah
Telling the truth is easier said than done.
Can\'t you see
Telling the truth is easier said than done.
"Don\'t leave baby" now that\'s what I meant to say'b"Eleven days, a dozen nights
A thousand tears and you are my shoulder
From summer's haze, on morning light
The sun is rising just like I told you
If you fall, I'll never let your spirit break
If you call, I'll always soothe the cries you make
If it's all I can do, I'll slowly kiss your dreams awake
You're not alone for heavens sake, Mercury rising
From winter skies a cold embrace
The shadows meet and they drag you under
The moonlight's mine and yours to chase
Your star is rising beyond your wonder
If you fall, I'll never let your spirit break
If you call, I'll always soothe the cries you make
If it's all I can do, I'll slowly kiss your dreams awake
You're not alone for heavens sake, Mercury's rising
You're not alone for heaven sake
Your tears run so freely, your fears run so deeply down
The pressure is breaking, quicksilver awaking now
Can you feel it rise? Can you see it rise?
Droplets of dreams that you touched, disappear
There's change in the weather and wind in your hair
And Mercury's rising, Mercury's rising
Rising, rising, Mercury's rising
Eleven days, a dozen nights
A thousand tears and you are my shoulder
From summer's haze, on morning light
The sun is rising just like I told you"b"He tells you when,

Find your wings,
Find your voice

She kept me up all night and I'm wired
God bless cupid
I'm walking on water
A hundred times a day that I call her
I'm so stupid
So many things I want to do
I tell her but she needs her room
That makes me want to get in her space
This kinda love is amazing
Oh she makes me crazy
I love how she never can stay
But it's enough that she wants me
Like her cup of coffee
One kiss baby she's on her way
That kinda love just makes your day
She's got an old boyfriend
Who calls her up at 2 in the morning
I'm so jealous
She says that it's nothing
That's how I know it's probably something
I'm so helpless
A guy like me so insecure
I never ever was before
Somebody finally put me in place
This kinda love is amazing
Oh she makes me crazy
I love how she never can stay
But it's enough that she wants me
Like her cup of coffee
One kiss baby she's on her way
That kinda love just makes your day
A guy like me so insecure
I never ever was before
Somebody finally put me in place
This kinda love is amazing
Oh she makes me crazy
I love how she never can stay
But it's enough that she wants me
