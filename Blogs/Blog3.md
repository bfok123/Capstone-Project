<ins>**Project Proposal, Due April 14: Music Lyric Generation**</ins>  

**Minimal viable action plan with stretch goals:**  

<ins>Input:</ins> Song structure, topics and/or keywords for each part  
<ins>Output:</ins> Complete song with given structure and topics/keywords  
<ins>Technique:</ins> Deep learning using data from RhymeZone (or other rhyme database), and also from scraping lyrics using the Genius API.  
<ins>Initial Goal:</ins> Generate a rnn model for generating pop song lyrics, with rhymes built in.  
<ins>Stretch Goal:</ins> Generate 6 rnn models for 3 music genres, allowing users to choose a combination of genres for their lyric generation.  
<ins>Strecth Goal #2:</ins> Develop a front end for our application.  

**Motivation:**  

To learn more about rnn's and NLP techniques.  Make rhymes with text generation instead of just training a model and running it.  We also have an interest in music and want to provide musicians an easy way to come up with lyrics and inspiration.

**Project Objectives:**  

**Proposed Methodologies:**  

**Available Resources:**  

**Evaluation Plan:**  

This will be our hardest task since "how good" lyrics are is usually a matter of a person's opinion.
