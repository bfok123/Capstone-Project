**Due April 14:**  

Project proposal. Include both the minimal viable action plan as well as stretch goals. Clearly state your motivation, related work (literature survey),  
project objectives, proposed methodologies, available resources, and the evaluation plan.

**Project Proposal: Music Lyric Generation**

**Minimal viable action plan with stretch goals:**  

<ins>Input:</ins> Song structure, topics and/or keywords for each part  
<ins>Output:</ins> Complete song with given structure and topics/keywords  
<ins>Technique:</ins> Deep learning using data from RhymeZone (or other rhyme database), and also from scraping lyrics using the Genius API.  
<ins>Initial Goal:</ins> Generate a rnn model for generating pop song lyrics, with rhymes built in.  
<ins>Stretch Goal:</ins> Generate 6 rnn models for 3 music genres, allowing users to choose a combination of genres for their lyric generation.  
<ins>Strecth Goal #2:</ins> Develop a front end for our application.  

**Motivation:**  

To learn more about rnn's and NLP techniques.  Make rhymes with text generation instead of just training a model and running it.  We also have an interest in music and want to provide musicians an easy way to come up with lyrics and inspiration.
