**Due May 21:**   

Datasets for other genres, streamlined rhyming post-processing, attached to frontend, topic support.

## New Datasets ##
We were happy with our pop dataset that we created by scraping Genius Lyrics last week so this week we gathered datasets for other genres, hip-hop, country, and Minecraft, like we planned in our project proposal. We scraped 40 songs from each of the 30 top artists of each genre in 2019 except for Minecraft which we could only find 6 high-profile artists on Genius Lyrics. Like the pop dataset, we split each of the other datasets into intros, verses, choruses, bridges, and outros. We only had time to train the models for hip-hop this week.
Breakdown of datasets:
| Pop                                                                     | Hip-hop                                                                | Country                                                               | Minecraft                                                         |

## Post-processing ##

## Frontend ##
To start the application clone the repo, navigate to the frontend directory, and run index.py.  
Choose a genre, optionally define a topic, choose which sections to generate, choose the rhyming scheme of each section, and view the generated lyrics. Only pop and hip-hop work right now.
