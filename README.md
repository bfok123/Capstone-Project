# Music Lyric Generator

To start the application clone the repo, `pip install -r requirements.txt`, navigate to the frontend directory, and run index.py.  
Choose a genre, optionally define a topic, choose which sections to generate, choose the rhyming scheme of each section, and view the generated lyrics. Only pop and hip-hop work right now.
