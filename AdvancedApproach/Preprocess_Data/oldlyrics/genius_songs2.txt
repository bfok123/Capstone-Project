[Verse 1]
Thought I'd end up with Sean
But he wasn't a match
Wrote some songs about Ricky
Now I listen and laugh
Even almost got married
And for Pete, I'm so thankful
Wish I could say, "Thank you" to Malcolm
'Cause he was an angel

[Pre-Chorus]
One taught me love
One taught me patience
And one taught me pain
Now, I'm so amazing
Say I've loved and I've lost
But that's not what I see
So, look what I got
Look what you taught me
And for that, I say

[Chorus]
Thank you, next (Next)
Thank you, next (Next)
Thank you, next
I'm so fuckin' grateful for my ex
Thank you, next (Next)
Thank you, next (Next)
Thank you, next (Next)
I'm so fuckin'

[Verse 2]
Spend more time with my friends
I ain't worried 'bout nothin'
Plus, I met someone else
We havin' better discussions
I know they say I move on too fast
But this one gon' last
'Cause her name is Ari
And I'm so good with that (So good with that)

[Pre-Chorus]
She taught me love (Love)
She taught me patience (Patience)
How she handles pain (Pain)
That shit's amazing (Yeah, she's amazing)
I've loved and I've lost (Yeah, yeah)
But that's not what I see (Yeah, yeah)
'Cause look what I've found (Yeah, yeah)
Ain't no need for searching, and for that, I say

[Chorus]
Thank you, next (Thank you, next)
Thank you, next (Thank you, next)
Thank you, next (Thank you)
I'm so fuckin' grateful for my ex
Thank you, next (Thank you, next)
Thank you, next (Said thank you, next)
Thank you, next (Next)
I'm so fuckin' grateful for my ex

[Post-Chorus]
Thank you, next
Thank you, next
Thank you, next
I'm so fuckin'

[Bridge]
One day I'll walk down the aisle
Holding hands with my mama
I'll be thanking my dad
'Cause she grew from the drama
Only wanna do it once, real bad
Gon' make that shit last
God forbid something happens
Least this song is a smash (Song is a smash)

[Pre-Chorus]
I've got so much love (Love)
Got so much patience (Patience)
And I've learned from the pain (Pain)
I turned out amazing (Turned out amazing)
Say I've loved and I've lost (Yeah, yeah)
But that's not what I see (Yeah, yeah)
'Cause look what I've found (Yeah, yeah)
Ain't no need for searching
And for that, I say

[Chorus]
Thank you, next (Thank you, next)
Thank you, next (Thank you, next)
Thank you, next
I'm so fuckin' grateful for my ex
Thank you, next (Thank you, next)

I'm so fuckin' grateful for my ex

[Post-Chorus]
Thank you, next
Thank you, next
Thank you, next
Yeah, yee
Thank you, next
Thank you, next
Thank you, next
Yeah, yee[Verse 1]
Yeah, breakfast at Tiffany's and bottles of bubbles
Girls with tattoos who like getting in trouble
Lashes and diamonds, ATM machines
Buy myself all of my favorite things (Yeah)
Been through some bad shit, I should be a sad bitch
Who woulda thought it'd turn me to a savage?
Rather be tied up with calls and not strings
Write my own checks like I write what I sing, yeah (Yeah)

[Pre-Chorus]
My wrist, stop watchin', my neck is flossy
Make big deposits, my gloss is poppin'
You like my hair? Gee, thanks, just bought it
I see it, I like it, I want it, I got it (Yeah)

[Chorus]
I want it, I got it, I want it, I got it
I want it, I got it, I want it, I got it
You like my hair? Gee, thanks, just bought it
I see it, I like it, I want it, I got it (Yep)

[Verse 2]
Wearing a ring, but ain't gon' be no "Mrs."
Bought matching diamonds for six of my bitches
I'd rather spoil all my friends with my riches
Think retail therapy my new addiction
Whoever said money can't solve your problems
Must not have had enough money to solve 'em
They say, "Which one?" I say, "Nah, I want all of 'em"
Happiness is the same price as red-bottoms

[Pre-Chorus]
My smile is beamin' (Yeah), my skin is gleamin' (Is gleamin')
The way it shine, I know you've seen it (You've seen it)
I bought a crib just for (Just for) the closet (Closet)
Both his and hers, I want it, I got it, yeah

[Chorus]
I want it, I got it, I want it, I got it
I want it, I got it, I want it, I got it (Baby)
You like my hair? Gee, thanks, just bought it (Oh yeah)
I see it, I like it, I want it, I got it (Yep)

[Verse 3]
Yeah, my receipts be lookin' like phone numbers
If it ain't money, then wrong number
Black card is my business card
The way it be settin' the tone for me
I don't mean to brag, but I be like, "Put it in the bag," yeah
When you see them racks, they stacked up like my ass, yeah
Shoot, go from the store to the booth
Make it all back in one loop, gimme the loot
Never mind, I got the juice
Nothing but net when we shoot
Look at my neck, look at my jet
Ain't got enough money to pay me respect
Ain't no budget when I'm on the set
If I like it, then that's what I get, yeah

[Chorus]
I want it, I got it, I want it, I got it (Oh yeah)
I want it, I got it, I want it, I got it (Oh yeah, yeah)
You like my hair? Gee, thanks, just bought it
I see it, I like it, I want it, I got it (I see, yep)[Directed by Jesse John Jenkins]

[Verse 1]
I was left to my own devices
Many days fell away with nothing to show

[Pre-Chorus]
And the walls kept tumbling down in the city that we love
Grey clouds roll over the hills, bringing darkness from above

[Chorus]
But if you close your eyes
Does it almost feel like nothing changed at all?
And if you close your eyes
Does it almost feel like you've been here before?
How am I going to be an optimist about this?
How am I going to be an optimist about this?

[Verse 2]
We were caught up and lost in all of our vices
In your pose as the dust settled around us

[Pre-Chorus]
And the walls kept tumbling down in the city that we love
Grey clouds roll over the hills, bringing darkness from above

[Chorus]
But if you close your eyes
Does it almost feel like nothing changed at all?
And if you close your eyes
Does it almost feel like you've been here before?
How am I going to be an optimist about this?
How am I going to be an optimist about this?

[Bridge]
Oh, where do we begin, the rubble or our sins?
Oh, where do we begin, the rubble or our sins?

[Pre-Chorus]
And the walls kept tumbling down in the city that we love
(Oh, where do we begin, the rubble or our sins?)
Grey clouds roll over the hills bringing darkness from above
(Oh, where do we begin, the rubble or our sins?)

[Chorus]
But if you close your eyes
Does it almost feel like nothing changed at all?
And if you close your eyes
Does it almost feel like you've been here before?
How am I going to be an optimist about this?
How am I going to be an optimist about this?
If you close your eyes
Does it almost feel like nothing changed at all?

So, what would you little maniacs like to do first?

[Refrain]
Watching through my fingers
Watching through my fingers

[Verse 1]
Shut my eyes and count to ten
It goes in one ear out the other, oh
One ear out the other, oh
Burning bright right 'til the end
Now youll be missing from the photographs
Missing from the photographs

[Refrain]
Watching through my fingers
Watching through my fingers

[Verse 2]
In my thoughts youre far away
And you are whistling a melody
Whistling a melody
Crystallizing clear as day
Oh I can picture you so easily
Picture you so easily

[Pre-Chorus]
Whats gonna be left of the world if youre not in it?
Whats gonna be left of the world? Oh

[Chorus]
Every minute and every hour
I miss you, I miss you, I miss you more
Every stumble and each misfire
I miss you, I miss you, I miss you more

[Refrain]
Watching through my fingers
Watching through my fingers

[Verse 3]
Caught off guard by your favourite song
Oh Ill be dancing at a funeral
Dancing at a funeral
Sleeping in the clothes you love
Its such a shame we had to see them burn
Shame we had to see them burn

[Pre-Chorus]
Whats gonna be left of the world if youre not in it?
Whats gonna be left of the world, oh

[Chorus]
Every minute and every hour
I miss you, I miss you, I miss you more
Every stumble and each misfire
I miss you, I miss you, I miss you more

[Interlude]
If you want to be a party animal, you have to learn to live in the jungle
Now stop worrying and go get dressed

[Bridge]
You might have to excuse me
Ive lost control of all my senses
And you might have to excuse me
Ive lost control of all my words
So get drunk, call me a fool
Put me in my place, put me in my place
Pick me up, up off the floor
Put me in my place, put me in my place

[Chorus]
Every minute and every hour
I miss you, I miss you, I miss you more
Every stumble and each misfire
I miss you, I miss you, I miss you more

[Refrain]
Watching through my fingers
Watching through my fingers

Cause every minute and every hour
I miss you, I miss you, I miss you more[Intro: spoken]
"'It was a slight on my honor, so he deserved it
'But we're talking about the most brilliant mind this world's ever seen'"

[Verse 1]
I've got demons running round in my head
And they feed on insecurities I have
Won't you lay your healing hands on my chest?
Let your ritual clean

[Pre-Chorus]
Soak the ropes with your holy water
Tie me down as you read out the words

[Chorus]
Set me free from my jealousy
Won't you exorcise my mind?
Won't you exorcise my mind?
I want to be free as I'll ever be
Exorcise my mind
Help me exorcise my mind

[Verse 2]
Desdemona, won't you liberate me?
When I'm haunted by your ancient history
Close these green eyes and watch over as I sleep
Through my darkest of dreams

[Pre-Chorus]
Be the power to compel me
Hold me closer than anyone before

[Chorus]
Set me free from my jealousy
Won't you exorcise my mind?
Won't you exorcise my mind?
I want to be free as I'll ever be
Exorcise my mind
Help me exorcise my mind

[Bridge]
I should be thinking 'bout nothing else when I'm with you-ou
With you-ou, ohohoh
I should be thinking 'bout nothing else when I'm with you-ou
With you-ou, ohohoh

[Intermezzo: spoken]
"Your mind exists somewhere altogether different; it lives in a world where feelings simply cannot be defined by words"

[Chorus]
Set me free from my jealousy
Won't you exorcise my mind?
Won't you exorcise my mind?
I want to be free as I'll ever be
Exorcise my mind
Help me exorcise my mind

Help me exorcise my mind
Won't you exorcise my mind?[Verse 1]
So this is where we are
It's not where we had wanted to be
If half the world's gone mad
The other half just don't care, you see

[Pre-Chorus]
You don't want to fuck with us
British to the very last

[Chorus]
When it feels like the world's gone mad
And there's nothing you can do about it
No, there's nothing you can do about it
When it feels like the world's gone mad
And there's nothing you can do about it
No, there's nothing you can do about it

[Verse 2]
So tell me what's the news
And what is it you want me to see
We're lying to ourselves
And dancing by the light of the screen

[Pre-Chorus]
You don't want to fuck with us
British to the very last

[Chorus]
When it feels like the world's gone mad
And there's nothing you can do about it
No, there's nothing you can do about it
When it feels like the world's gone mad
And there's nothing you can do about it
No, there's nothing you can do about it

[Verse 3]
Another man holding a microphone
Trying to say something at all
Or finding himself on an empty road
Trying to choose which way to go

[Bridge]
So, you wanna make some money?
You wanna make some money
So, you wanna be somebody?
You wanna make some money

[Chorus]
When it feels like the world's gone mad
And there's nothing you can do about it
No, there's nothing you can do about it
When it feels like the world's gone mad
And there's nothing you can do about it
No, there's nothing you can do about it[Intro]
When I watch the world burn
All I think about is you
When I watch the world burn
All I think about is you

[Verse]
There must be something in the Kool-Aid
Cruising through the doom days
God knows what is real and what is fake
Last couple years have been a mad trip
How'd yall look so perfect?
You must have some portraits in the attic
We'll stay offline so no one gets hurt
Hiding from the real world
Just don't read the comments ever, ever
We fucked this house up like the planet
We were running riot
Crazy that some people still deny it
Think Im addicted to my phone
My scrolling horror show
I'm live-streaming the final days of Rome
One tab along, it's pornographic
Everybody's at it
No surprise we're so easily bored
Let's pick the truth that we believe in
Like a bad religion
Tell me all your original sins
So many questionable choices
We love the sound that our voice makes
Man, this echo chamber's getting loud
We're gonna choose the blue pill
Were gonna close the curtains
Were gonna rabbit hole down, third act love now
She's gonna flip some tables
Im gonna move this tale on
We're gonna rabbit hole down, third act love now
We'll be the proud remainers
Here 'til the morning breaks us
We run away from real life thoughts tonight
Were gonna Peter Pan out
Fade to the close-up, arms 'round
We're gonna stay naive tonight, night, night

[Chorus]
When I watch the world burn
All I think about is you
When I watch the world burn
All I think about is you
You
All I think about is you
So I put my phone down
Fall into the night with you[Spoken Intro: Norman, Marion]
Well I-I run the office and eh, tend the cabins and grounds and do little, eh errands for my mother. The ones she allows I might be capable of doing
And do you go out with friends?
Well a-a boy's best friend is his mother

[Verse 1: Dan Smith]
A scrub is a guy who thinks hes fly
And is also known as a buster
Always talkin about what he wants
And just sits on his broke ass, so

[Refrain: Dan Smith]
No, I dont want your number
No, I dont want to give you mine and
No, I dont want to meet you nowhere
No, I dont want none of your time

[Chorus: Dan Smith]
No, I dont want no scrubs
A scrub is a guy that cant get no love from me
Hangin out the passenger side
Of his best friends ride
Trying to holler at me
I dont want no scrubs
A scrub is a guy that cant get no love from me
Hangin out the passenger side
Of his best friends ride
Trying to holler at me
Trying to holler at me at me, at me

[Verse 2: Ella Eyre]
But a scrub's checkin' me and his game is kinda weak
And I know that he can not approach me
Cause I'm looking like class and he's looking like trash
Can't get with no dead beat ass, so, no

[Refrain: Dan Smith]
No, I dont want your number
No, I dont want to give you mine and
No, I dont want to meet you nowhere
No, dont want none of your time

[Chorus: Ella Eyre]
No, I dont want no scrubs
A scrub is a guy that cant get no love from me
Hangin out the passenger side
Of his best friends ride
Trying to holler at me
I dont want no scrub
A scrub is a guy that cant get no love from me
Hangin out the passenger side
Of his best friends ride
Trying to holler at me
Holler at me
Holler at me
Holler at me

[Bridge: Dan Smith, Norman]
If you dont have a car and youre walking
(Oh yes son, Ive been talking to you)
If you live at home with your mama
We're all in our private traps
If you have a shorty but you dont show love
Clamped in them, and none of us can ever get out
Wanna get me with no money
Oh no, I dont want to, no

[Bridge: Ella Eyre with backing vocals, Norman, Marion]
No scrubs, no scrubs
Sometimes we deliberately step into those traps
No scrubs, no scrubs
I was born in mine; I don't mind it anymore
No scrubs, no scrubs
Oh but you should, you should mind it
No scrubs, no scrubs
Oh I do, ha, but I say I don't, ha

[Chorus: Dan Smith with Ella Eyre, Ella Eyre, Dan Smith]
No, I dont want no scrubs
A scrub is a guy that cant get no love from me
Hangin out the passenger side
Of his best friends ride
Trying to holler at me
I dont want no scrubs
A scrub is a guy that cant get no love from me
Hangin out the passenger side
Of his best friends ride
Trying to holler at me
Trying to holler at me
Trying to holler at me
Trying to holler at me

(Being as in love with you as I am)
(Being as in love with you as I am)
(Being as in love with you as I am)
(Being as in love with you as I am)[Intro]
And I don't think that that's a selfish want, I really don't. I'm not saying that I have this capacity because it's hard to develop that capacity on your own, when you're being stopped at every turn

[Verse 1]
Drive around, night time, nowhere to go
Melt me down, I'm like wax to your jokes
Lost and found, knocking heads, laying low
And there's no point reliving crimes to lose this

[Pre-Chorus]
Still wanna waste all of my time
I wanna waste all of my time
Still wanna waste all of my time
I wanna waste all of my time
With you

[Chorus]
Oh my lover, my lover, my love
We can never go back
We can only do our best to recreate
Don't turn over, turn over the page
We should rip it straight out
Then let's try our very best to fake it

[Verse 2]
Show me joy, flower through disarray
Let's destroy, each mistake that we made
Then restore the color back to the grey
There's no pride in sharing scars to prove it

[Pre-Chorus]
Still wanna waste all of my time
I wanna waste all of my time
Still wanna waste all of my time
I wanna waste all of my time
With you

[Chorus]
Oh my lover, my lover, my love
We can never go back
We can only do our best to recreate
Don't turn over, turn over the page
We should rip it straight out
Then let's try our very best to fake it

[Bridge]
Help me turn a blind eye
Days and nights we lost to weakness
Help me turn a blind eye
Days and nights we lost to weakness

[Chorus]
Oh my lover, my lover, my love
We can never go back
We can only do our best to recreate
Don't turn over, turn over the page
We should rip it straight out
Then let's do our very best to fake it
Oh my lover, my lover, my love
We can never go back
We can only do our best to recreate
Don't turn over, turn over the page
We should rip it straight out
Then let's do our very best to fake it[Verse 1]
When you fall asleep
With your head upon my shoulder
When you're in my arms
But you've gone somewhere deeper

[Pre-Chorus]
Are you going to age with grace?
Are you going to age without mistakes?
Are you going to age with grace?
Or only to wake and hide your face?

[Chorus]
When oblivion
Is calling out your name
You always take it further
Than I ever can

[Verse 2]
When you play it hard
And I try to follow you there
It's not about control
But I turn back when I see where you go

[Pre-Chorus]
Are you going to age with grace?
Are you going to leave a path to trace?

[Chorus]
When oblivion
Is calling out your name
You always take it further
Than I ever can

[Chorus]
When oblivion
Is calling out your name
You always take it further
Than I ever can[Verse 1]
It's a quarter past midnight
As we cut through the city
Yeah, yeah, yeah, the streets are getting restless
Good times, bad decisions
Yeah, yeah, yeah, it's a quarter past midnight
And the sirens are mending some hearts
But we're the losers on the back seats
Singing "Love Will Tear Us Apart"

[Pre-Chorus]
It's a quarter past midnight
Still avoiding tomorrow
It's a quarter past midnight
But we're just getting going

[Chorus]
We keep on running
Running through a red light
Like we're trying to burn the night away
Away-way, oh, away-way, oh

[Post-Chorus]
This is my favourite part, oh
Help me piece it all together, darling
Before it falls apart, oh
Help me piece it all together

[Verse 2]
It's a quarter past midnight
And the speakers are blowing
Yeah, yeah, we want the bodies on the billboards
Not the lives underneath them
Yeah, yeah, yeah, and now we're crawling up the walls again
And it's a quarter past twelve
And you said we'd leave this place in dust
And fall from heaven straight through hell
We never know what we have
We never knew what we had

[Chorus]
We keep on running
Running through a red light
Like we're trying to burn the night away
Away-way, oh, away-way, oh
Why are we always chasing after something
Like we're trying to throw our lives away?
Away-way, oh, away-way, oh

[Post-Chorus]
This is my favourite part, oh
Help me piece it all together, darling
Before it falls apart, oh
Help me piece it all together

[Bridge]
(I can't remember, I can't remember
I can't remember, I can't remember)
It's a quarter past midnight
And the secrets are flowing
Our lips are getting looser
I don't know what I'm saying
We never knew what we had
I never know what I've had

[Chorus]
We keep on running
Running through a red light
Like we're trying to burn the night away
Away-way, oh, away-way, oh
Why are we always chasing after something
Like we're trying to throw our lives away?
Away-way, oh, away-way, oh

[Post-Chorus]
This is my favourite part so
Help me piece it all together, darling
Before it falls apart
Help me piece it all together[Verse 1]
Deep in a corner of the night
We were lying in the middle of the road
Counting the planes as they flew by
Inconceivable imagining them go
And drunk we set the world to rights
As we fell and hit our heads upon the curb
You make me laugh until I die
Can you think of any better way to choke?

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Stories told to me and stories told to you
Did you ever feel like they were ringing true?

[Chorus]
And all their words for glory
Well they always sounded empty
When we're looking up for heaven
Looking up for heaven
Way down here upon the ground
When we're lying in the dirt
There's no looking up for heaven
Looking up for heaven

[Verse 2]
Not everything had gone to plan
But we made the best of what we had, you know?
Passing the drink from hand to hand
We admit we really know nothing at all

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Stories told to me and stories told to you
And was it feeling real? And were they ringing true?

[Chorus]
And all their words for glory
Well they always sounded empty
When we're looking up for heaven
Looking up for heaven
And way down here upon the ground
When we're lying in the dirt
There's no looking up for heaven
Looking up for heaven

[Bridge]
I'll take my chances on the curb here with you
We watched the planes leave us behind
On the curb here with you
We watched the planes leave us behind

And then you put your hand in mine
And pulled me back from things divine
Stop looking up for heaven
Waiting to be buried

[Chorus]
And all their words for glory
Well they always sounded empty
When we're looking up for heaven
Looking up for heaven
Way down here upon the ground
When we're lying in the dirt
There's no looking up for heaven
Looking up...[Intro: spoken]
- "When the event happens, there is little time to think of those things that people would like to have remain private"
- "Getting caught up in the circus-like atmosphere, feeling less responsible to conventional ethical practices"

[Verse 1]
Never good just the bad and the ugly
Laid in front of you
Nothing quite like seeing the world
Through the TV's window

Feeling helpless I look for distraction
I go searching for you
Wandering through our city to find some
Solace at your door

[Pre-Chorus 1]
I can't stop thinking about it
I can't stop thinking about it
Tell me, did you see the news tonight?

[Chorus]
Hold me in this wild, wild world
'Cause in your warmth I forget how cold it can be
And in your heat I feel how cold it can get
Hold me in this wild, wild world
'Cause in your warmth I forget how cold it can be
And in your heat I feel how cold it can get
Now draw me close...

[Verse 2]
So come on, let's forget the emotion
Tie the blinkers on
Hold both hands right over my eyes
Deafen me with music

'Till we're lost in the heat of the moment
And I'm moving in you
Help me keep these hours alive
Help me chase those seconds

[Pre-Chorus 2]
I just keep talking about it
But I'll do nothing about it
Tell me, did you see the news last night?

[Chorus]
Hold me in this wild, wild world
'Cause in your warmth I forget how cold it can be
And in your heat I feel how cold you can get
Hold me in this wild, wild world
'Cause in your warmth I forget how cold it can be
And in your heat I feel how cold it can get
Now draw me close

[Bridge]
Hold me in this wild, wild world

[Chorus]
Hold me in this wild, wild world
'Cause in your warmth I forget how cold it can be
And in your heat I feel how cold it can get
Hold me in this wild, wild world
'Cause in your warmth I forget how cold it can be
And in your heat I feel how cold it can get
So hold me close
Hold me close[Verse 1]
You go sleep with the fishes
Theres no room for you here
Theres no room for you here
Wrap your teeth around the pavement
'Cause your bodys a message
Send my regards to hell

[Chorus 1]
Fall upon your knees, sing:
"This is my body and soul here"
Crawl and beg and plead, sing:
"Youve got the power to control"
Dont pin it all on me
Dont pin it all on me!

[Verse 2]
Youve been granted three wishes
Say goodbye to your mother, your father, your son
I can hear your pulse racing from here
Sitting next to this gun beats your heart in your mouth

[Chorus 1]
Fall upon your knees, sing:
"This is my body and soul here"
Crawl and beg and plead, sing:
"Youve got the power to control"
Dont pin it all on me
Dont pin it all on me!

[Bridge]
Blame, blame, blame (I got you, I got you)
Blame, blame, blame (I got you, I got you)
Blame, blame, blame (I got you, I got you)
Blame, blame, blame (I got you, I got you)

[Chorus 2]
Fall upon your knees, sing:
"This is my body and soul here"
Crawl and beg and plead, sing:
"Youve got the power to control here
This is my body and this is my soul!
Fall upon your knees, sing:
This is my body and soul
Dont pin it all on me
Dont pin it all on me!

[Outro]
Dont pin it all on me
Dont pin it all on me[Verse 1]
Roll up another cigarette
Using the minute that it takes
To think about the power of your words
We're living in the currents you create
We're sinking in the pool of your mistakes
So stub it out, your podium awaits

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh my God, my God
I can't quite believe my ears

[Chorus]
I'm swimming to the surface
I'm coming up for air
Cause you're making me feel nervous
I need to clear my head
I can't believe my ears
I don't wanna believe my ears
I'm swimming to the surface
I'm coming up for air

[Verse 2]
How can you think you're serious?
Do you even know what year it is?
I can't believe the scary points you make
Still living in the currents you create
Still sinking in the pool of your mistakes
Won't you stop firing up the crazies?

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh my God, my God
I can't quite believe my ears

[Chorus]
I'm swimming to the surface
I'm coming up for air
Cause you're making me feel nervous
I need to clear my head
I can't believe my ears
I don't wanna believe my ears
I'm swimming to the surface
I'm coming up for air

[Intermezzo]
"When anybody preaches disunity, tries to pit one of us against the other ... you know that person seeks to rob us of our freedom and destroy our very lives"

[Bridge]
Oh, I need a breath
I need a breath
Fill my lungs
Won't you fill my lungs?
Oh, I need a breath
I need a breath
Fill my lungs
Let me fill my lungs
Oh, I need a breath
I need a breath
Fill my lungs
Let me fill my lungs
Oh, I need a breath
I need a breath
Fill my lungs
Let me fill my lungs

[Chorus]
I'm swimming to the surface
I'm coming up for air
Cause you're making me feel nervous
I need to clear my head
I can't believe my ears
I don't wanna believe my ears
I'm swimming to the surface
I'm coming up for air[Verse 1]
When all of your flaws and all of my flaws
Are laid out one by one
A wonderful part of the mess that we made
We pick ourselves undone
All of your flaws and all of my flaws
They lie there hand in hand
Ones we've inherited, ones that we learn
They pass from man to man

[Pre-Chorus]
There's a hole in my soul
I can't fill it, I can't fill it
There's a hole in my soul
Can you fill it? Can you fill it?

[Chorus]
You have always worn your flaws upon your sleeve
And I have always buried them deep beneath the ground

[Post-Chorus]
Dig them up
Let's finish what we've started
Dig them up
So nothing's left unturned

[Verse 2]
All of your flaws and all of my flaws
When they have been exhumed
We'll see that we need them to be who we are
Without them, we'd be doomed

[Pre-Chorus]
There's a hole in my soul
I can't fill it, I can't fill it
There's a hole in my soul
Can you fill it? Can you fill it?

[Chorus]
You have always worn your flaws upon your sleeve
And I have always buried them deep beneath the ground

[Post-Chorus]
Dig them up
Let's finish what we've started
Dig them up
So nothing's left unturned

[Bridge]
Oh, oh, oh-oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh-oh, oh
When all of your flaws and all of my flaws are counted
When all of your flaws and all of my flaws are counted

[Chorus]
You have always worn your flaws upon your sleeve
And I have always buried them deep beneath the ground

[Post-Chorus]
Dig them up
Let's finish what we've started
Dig them up
So nothing's left unturned

[Breakdown]
Oh, oh, oh-oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh-oh, oh

[Outro]
All of your flaws and all of my flaws
Are laid out one by one
Look at the wonderful mess that we made
We pick ourselves undone[Intro]
Things we lost to the flames
Things we'll never see again
All that we've amassed
Sits before us, shattered into ash

[Chorus 1]
These are the things, the things we lost
The things we lost in the fire, fire, fire
These are the things, the things we lost
The things we lost in the fire, fire, fire

[Verse 1]
We sat and made a list
Of all the things that we had
Down the backs of table tops
Ticket stubs and your diaries
I read them all one day
When loneliness came and you were away
Oh, they told me nothing new
But I love to read the words you use

[Chorus 1]
These are the things, the things we lost
The things we lost in the fire, fire, fire
These are the things, the things we lost
The things we lost in the fire, fire, fire

[Verse 2]
I was the match and you were the rock
Maybe we started this fire?
We sat apart and watched
All we had burned on the pyre
You said, (Oh oh oh) "We were born with nothing
And we sure as hell have nothing now"
You said, "We were born with nothing
And we sure as hell have nothing now"

[Chorus 1]
These are the things, the things we lost
The things we lost in the fire, fire, fire
These are the things, the things we lost
The things we lost in the fire, fire, fire

[Bridge]
Do you understand that we will
Never be the same again?
Do you understand that we will
Never be the same again?
The future's in our hands and we will
Never be the same again
The future's in our hands and we will
Never be the same again

[Chorus 2]
These are the things (These are the things), the things we lost (The things we lost)
The things we lost in the fire, fire, fire
These are the things (These are the things), the things we lost (The things we lost)
The things we lost in the fire, fire, fire
These are the things (These are the things), the things we lost (The things we lost)
These are the things we lost in the fire, fire, fire

[Outro]
Flames, they licked the walls
Tenderly, they turned to dust all that I adored...[Intro]
I don't wanna talk about it
I don't wanna talk about it
I don't wanna talk about it
I don't wanna talk about it

[Refrain 1]
Oh-oh oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh-oh oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh-oh oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh-oh oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh

[Verse 1]
We were young and drinking in the park
There was nowhere else to go
And you said you always had my back
Oh, but how were we to know?

[Pre-Chorus 1]
That these are the days that bind you
Together, forever
And these little things define you
Forever, forever

[Chorus]
All this bad blood here
Won't you let it dry?
It's been cold for years
Won't you let it lie?

[Refrain 2]
Oh-oh oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh-oh oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh

[Verse 2]
If we're only ever looking back
We will drive ourselves insane
As the friendship goes, resentment grows
We will walk our different ways

[Pre-Chorus 2]
That those are the days that bind us
Together, forever
And those little things define us
Forever, forever

[Chorus]
All this bad blood here
Won't you let it dry?
It's been cold for years
Won't you let it lie?

[Bridge]
And I don't wanna hear about the bad blood anymore
I don't wanna hear you talk about it anymore
I don't wanna hear about the bad blood anymore
I don't wanna hear you talk about it anymore

[Chorus]
All this bad blood here
Won't you let it dry?
It's been cold for years
Won't you let it lie?

[Refrain 1]
Oh-oh oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh-oh oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh-oh oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh-oh oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh[Verse 1]
Thought I'd never be waking on the kitchen floor
But here I lie, not the first time
Now my morning has broken, and it brings the fear
My mind's falling, fall in

[Pre-Chorus]
Then I feel my pulse quickening
But regrets can't change anything
Yeah, I feel my pulse quickening
When your name lights up the screen

[Chorus]
Oh joy, when you call me
I was giving up, oh, I was giving in
Joy, set my mind free
I was giving up, oh, I was giving in

[Post-Chorus]
How d'you always know when I'm down?
How d'you always know when I'm down?

[Verse 2]
Take a walk through the wreckage, clearing out my head
I hear your eyes roll right down the phone
I'm your walking disaster, keep on dragging me
From self-pity, poor me

[Pre-Chorus]
Then I feel my pulse quickening
But I wouldn't change a thing

[Chorus]
Oh joy, when you call me
I was giving up, oh, I was giving in
Joy, set my mind free
I was giving up, oh, I was giving in

[Post-Chorus]
How d'you always know when I'm down?
How d'you always know when I'm down?

[Bridge]
As the night dissolves into this final frame
You're a sweet relief, you saved me from my brain
From my brain, from my brain, from my brain
Oh, oh, oh, oh

[Chorus]
Oh joy, when you call me
I was giving up, oh, I was giving in
Joy, set my mind free
I was giving up, oh, I was giving in

[Post-Chorus]
How d'you always know when I'm down?
How d'you always know when I'm down?

[Outro]
I feel joy when you call me
I feel joy when you call me (I-I-I feel joy)
I feel joy when you call me
I feel joy when you call me
How d'you always know when I'm down?
How d'you always know when I'm down?[Intro: spoken]
3, 4...

[Verse 1]
Im the lesser of two evils
Or am I, am I tricking myself nice?
If Im the lesser of two evils
Whos this man, whos this act I hide behind?

[Chorus]
There are two ways to skin tonight
Lets see whose road gets there faster
This is a game no wrongs no right
Only a winner and a loser

You and I, oh you and I
Were not that different you and I
Oh you and I, you and I
Were not that different you and I

[Bridge]
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

[Verse 2]
Well I'm the lesser of two evils
So keep looking, just keep looking into my eyes
And as the lesser of two evils
It pays to, pays to be the nice guy sometimes

[Chorus]
There are two ways to skin tonight
Lets see whose road gets there faster
Here I am hiding in plain sight
If youre not careful you will lose her

You and I, you and I
Were not that different you and I
Oh you and I, you and I
Were not that different you and I

[Outro]
You and I, you and I
We're not that different, you and I[Verse 1]
These four walls to keep you
One floor to sleep upon and only
These four walls to keep you
These four walls contain you
Supposed to save you from yourself and
These four walls in Holcomb
To keep you from the sun

[Pre-Chorus]
And now we're faced with two wrongs
Now we're faced with two wrongs
I don't know, oh, I don't know
Now we're faced with two wrongs
Now we're faced with two wrongs
I don't know, oh, I don't know

[Chorus]
We could be born to anything
And now what, now what?
What you have done is terrible
And now you, and now you
Now, you carry it with you
You carry it with you
You carry it with you

[Verse 2]
These four walls will keep you
Until you face the rope
You've only these four walls before they
In cold blood, hang you up

[Pre-Chorus]
And now we're faced with two wrongs
Now we're faced with two wrongs
I don't know, oh, I don't know
Now we're faced with two wrongs
Now we're faced with two wrongs
I don't know, oh, I don't know

[Chorus]
We could be born to anything
And now what, now what?
What you have done is terrible
And now you, and now you
Now, you carry it with you
You carry it with you
You carry it with you
(Now, you carry it with you)
(Carry it with you)
(Carry it with you)

[Bridge]
There's no view from here
No view from here, no view from here
All you see's the sky
Clouds passing by, clouds passing by

[Chorus]
We could be born to anything
And now what, now what?
What you have done is terrible
And now what, and now what?
Now, you carry it with you
You carry it with you
You carry it with you
Now, you carry it with you
You carry it with you
You carry it with you

[Breakdown]
Now, you carry it with you
You carry it with you
You carry it with you

This is a collect call from Kansas State Penitentiary:

[Verse 1]
Boys and girls, wanna hear a true story?
Saturday night, was at this real wild party
There was liquor overflowin' the cup
About 5 or 6 strippers trying to work for a buck
So I took one girl outside with me
Her name was Londy, she went to Junior High with me
I said, "Why you up in there dancing for cash?
I guess a whole lot's changed since I seen you last"

[Chorus 1]
She said, "What would you do if your son was at home
Crying all alone on the bedroom floor
'Cause he's hungry, and the only way to feed him is to
Sleep with a man for a little bit of money?
And his daddy's gone in and out of lock down
I ain't got a job now; he's just smokin' rock now
So for you, this is just a good time
But for me, this is what I call life"

[Verse 2]
Girl, you ain't the only one to have a baby
That's no excuse to be living all crazy
So she stared me right square in the eye
And said, "Everyday, I wake up, hoping to die"
She said, "They're gonna know about pain
'Cause me and my sister ran away so our daddy couldn't rape us
Before I was a teenager
I done been through more of that shit you can't even relate to"

[Chorus 2]
"What would you do if your son was at home
Crying all alone on the bedroom floor
'Cause he's hungry, and the only way to feed him is to
Sleep with a man for a little bit of money?
And his daddy's gone in and out of lock down
I ain't got a job now; he's just smokin' rock now
So for you, this is just a good time
But for me, this is what I call life"

[Bridge]
(What would you do?)
Get up off my feet and stop making tired excuses
(What would you do?)
Get up off my feet and stop making tired excuses
(What would you do?)
Get up off my feet and stop making tired excuses
(What would you do?)
Get up off my feet!

[Chorus 2]
"What would you do if your son was at home
Crying all alone on the bedroom floor
'Cause he's hungry, and the only way to feed him is to
Sleep with a man for a little bit of money?
And his daddy's gone in and out of lock down
I ain't got a job now; he's just smokin' rock now
So for you, this is just a good time
But for me, this is what I call life"

[Chorus 2]
What would you do if your son was at home
Crying all alone on the bedroom floor
'Cause he's hungry, and the only way to feed him is to
Sleep with a man for a little bit of money?
And his daddy's gone in and out of lock down
I ain't got a job now; he's just smokin' rock now
So for you, this is just a good time
But for me, this is what I call life"

[Outro]
What would you do if your son was at home
Crying all alone on the bedroom floor
'Cause he's hungry...[Verse 1]
"Look who's digging their own grave"
That is what they all say; you'll drink yourself to death
Look who makes their own bed, lies right down within it
And what will you have left?

[Verse 2]
Out on the front doorstep, drinking from a paper cup
You won't remember this
Living beyond your years, acting out all their fears
You feel it in your chest

[Pre-Chorus]
Your hands protect the flames
From the wild winds around you

[Chorus 1]
Icarus is flying too close to the sun
And Icarus' life, it has only just begun

It's just begun...

[Verse 3]
Standing on the cliff face, highest fall you'll ever grace
It scares me half to death
Look out to the future, but it tells you nothing
So take another breath

[Pre-Chorus]
Your hands protect the flames
From the wild winds around you

[Chorus 2]
Icarus is flying
Too close to the sun
And Icarus' life
It has only just begun
This is how it feels
To take a fall
Icarus is flying
Towards an early grave

[Bridge]
You put up your defences when you leave
You leave because you're certain
Of who you want to be
You're putting up your armour when you leave
And you leave because you're certain
Of who you want to be

[Chorus 2]
Icarus is flying
Too close to the sun
And Icarus' life
It has only just begun
This is how it feels
To take a fall
Icarus is flying
Towards an early grave

[Outro]
Oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh-oh oh-oh, oh, oh
Oh oh, oh, oh, oh, oh-oh oh...[Verse 1]
Lethargy got a hold of me
And I don't know how to shake it
Got these itchy feet for a change of scene
Do anything to escape it

[Pre-Chorus]
Get up, get up, pressure, pressure
Run away as fast as you can go
Every day your friends and lovers
Give the answers everybody knows

[Chorus]
You told me not to be like anybody else
Head spin, happiness, death
Be like anybody else
Broke down nothing else left
You checked out years ago
Oh what I'd do not to worry like you
You checked out years ago
Oh what I'd do not to worry like you

"C'mon, relax"

[Verse 2]
There's an Englishman up in space these days
Floating in awe and wonder
As he broke away from the atmosphere
And all of us non-believers

[Pre-Chorus]
Get up, get up, pressure, pressure
Run away as fast as you can go
Every day your friends and lovers
Give the answers everybody knows

[Chorus]
You told me not to be like anybody else
Head spin, happiness, death
Be like anybody else
Broke down, nothing else left
You checked out years ago
Oh what I'd do not to worry like you
You checked out years ago
Oh what I'd do not to worry like you

[Bridge]
Paint the scene for me
Paint it bright and paint it clear
I don't want to use my imagination here
Don't want to use my imagination here
Paint the scene for me
Paint it bright and paint it clear
I don't want to use my imagination here
Don't want to use my imagination here

[Chorus]
You told me not to be like anybody else
Head spin, happiness, death
Be like anybody else
Broke down, nothing else left
You checked out years ag,o
Oh what I'd do not to worry like you
You checked out years ago
Oh what I'd do not to worry like you[Intro: spoken]
- "What do you know about it?"
- "Well, you gonna tell me..."
- "Why, I can't tell you. You don't - you can't - you can't explain now what's going on in your brain. You can't tell somebody how - wha-what's happening, what's going on in your- I can't."
- "Why don't you just try?"

[Verse 1]
Let those fools be loud
Let alarms ring out
'Cause you cut through all the noise
Let the days be dark
Let me hate my work
'Cause you cut through all the noise

[Pre-Chorus]
Bring me some hope
By wandering into my mind
Something to hold onto
Morning, noon day, or night

[Chorus]
You are the light that is blinding me
You're the anchor that I tied to my brain
'Cause when it feels like I'm lost at sea
You're the song I sing again and again
All the time, all the time
I think of you all the time

[Verse 2]
Let the parties end when we lose our friends
'Cause you cut through all the noise
Let the years roll on 'till the static comes
'Cause you cut through all the noise

[Pre-Chorus]
Bring me some hope
By wandering into my mind
Something to hold onto
Morning, noon day, or night

[Chorus]
You are the light that is blinding me
You're the anchor that I tied to my brain
'Cause when it feels like I'm lost at sea
You're the song I sing again and again
All the time, all the time
I think of you all the time
All the time, all the time
I think of you all the time

[Pre-Chorus]
Bring me some hope
By wandering into my mind
Something to hold onto
Morning, noon day, or night

[Chorus]
You are the light that is blinding me
You're the anchor that I tied to my brain
'Cause when it feels like I'm lost at sea
You're the song I sing again and again
All the time, all the time
I think of you all the time
All the time, all the time
I think of you all the time[Verse 1]
I am bound to you with a tie that we cannot break
With a night that we can't replace
I'm lost but found with you in a bed that we'll never make
It's a feeling we always chase

[Pre-Chorus]
I could write a book about the things that you said to me on the pillow
And the way you think and how you make me feel
You can fill my mind and move my body with the fiction, fantasies
Just call this what it is, we don't pretend it's real

[Chorus]
So don't make promises to me that you're gonna break
We only ever wanted one thing from this
Don't paint wonderful lies on me that wash away
We only ever wanted one thing from this
Oh, in another place
In another time, what could we have been?
Oh, in another place
In another time, what could we have been?

[Post-Chorus]
Mmm, in another time
And in another place

[Verse 2]
So lie to me tonight and pretend till the morning light
And imagine that you are mine
'Cause when the sun'll rise with the truth coming out your eyes
We'll be good in another life

[Pre-Chorus]
I could write a book about the things that you said to me on the pillow
And the way you think and how you make me feel
You can fill my mind and move my body with the fiction, fantasies
Just call this what it is, we don't pretend it's real

[Chorus]
So don't make promises to me that you're gonna break
We only ever wanted one thing from this
Don't paint wonderful lies on me that wash away
We only ever wanted one thing from this
Oh, in another place
In another time, what could we have been?
Oh, in another place
In another time, what could we have been?

[Bridge]
It felt like something special but it never felt like love
Wonder what we could be living in another life
Catch us in the mirror and it looks a lot like love
Then you stop me talking as you kiss me from above

[Chorus]
So don't make promises to me that you're gonna break
We only ever wanted one thing from this
Don't paint wonderful lies on me that wash away
We only ever wanted one thing from this
Oh, in another place
In another time, what could we have been?
Oh, in another place
In another time, what could we have been?

[Outro]
Oh, yeah
In another time
And in another place[Verse 1]
Aim, throw your best shot right at me
'Cause pain, I can take it easily
Did you really think I'd fall to my knees
Just to pray for some sweet simplicity?

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause whoa, you're squeezing my heart
Too hard in your bare hands, they hold too tight
And whoa the air is on fire
This room feels electric, caught here in your sights

[Chorus 1]
Power, power
I will never understand the power you were holding over me
Power, power
Oh you had it too long, yes you had it too long

[Verse 2]
Pain, just synapses firing in our brains
So when you cut me, cut me deep
Hurt the ones you love the most easily
'Cause in time we show our Achilles' heels

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause whoa, you're squeezing my heart
Too hard in your cold bare hands, they hold too tight
And whoa the air is on fire
This room feels electric, caught here in your sights

[Chorus 1]
Power, power
I will never understand the power you were holding over me
Power, power
Oh you had it too long, yes you had it too long

[Bridge]
If you're gonna hit me, hit me harder
(Hit me, hit me harder)
'Cause you better knock me out the first time
And if youre gonna do this rip the plaster
(Do this rip the plaster)
If you're gonna hit me, hit me harder than this
Power, power
Blows my mind to think I ever let you hold it over me

[Chorus 2]
Power, power
I will never understand the way I let you hold it over me
Power, power
Well you had it too long, yes you had it too long
Power, oh, oh, power, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Power, power
I let you had it too long, yes you had it too long[Verse 1]
Four in the morning, we find ourselves here
The best of us passed out, I don't know who's where
I got all my old friends and new friends I've met once before
In a blanket of smoke as we sink through the floor

[Pre-Chorus]
Here, here, my family
You are my familiar, you are my familiar, ah-ah
Here, here, my friends and me
You are my familiar, ah-ah

[Chorus]
Oh, there is nowhere I would rather be
Never felt more comfortable, could never want for more when I'm here
No, there is nowhere I would rather be, oh-oh
Never felt more comfortable, could never want for more when you're near

[Post-Chorus]
Ooh
Ooh, ah

[Verse 2]
Time skips, balloon hits, I'm losing my mind
Tuesday'll be doom day, this got out of hand

[Pre-Chorus]
Here, here, my family
You are my familiar, you are my familiar
Here, here, my friends and me
You are my familiar

[Chorus]
Oh, there is nowhere I would rather be
Never felt more comfortable, could never want for more when I'm here
No, there is nowhere I would rather be, oh-oh
Never felt more comfortable, could never want for more when you're near

[Post-Chorus]
Ooh
Ooh, ah

[Bridge]
I don't care if we're talking 'bout the same things
I don't care if we're stuck in the familiar
I don't care if we're going 'round in circles
Again, again, again

[Pre-Chorus]
Here, here, my family
(Might be a walking disaster)
You are my familiar, you are my familiar
(Not much, but all I would ask for)
Here, here, my friends and me
(Might be a walking disaster)
You are my familiar
(Not much, but all I would ask for)

[Chorus]
Oh, there is nowhere I would rather be
Never felt more comfortable, could never want for more when I'm here
Oh, there is nowhere I would rather be
I never felt more comfortable, could never want for more when you're near

[Post-Chorus]
Ooh, ah
Ooh, ah

[Outro]
I can't remember, I can't remember
I can't remember, I can't remember
I can't remember, I can't remember
I can't remember, I can't remember
Help me piece it all together, darlin'[Verse 1]
I can feel your eyes in the back of my head
Burning, burning, burning
Floating through the room as the hairs on my arms are
Rising, rising, rising
I'm chemically drawn closer to you
Eyes wide, eyes wide open
Will you be my future or just an escape?
Love me, love me, love me

[Pre-Chorus]
You'll never get to Heaven on a night like this

[Chorus]
Those nights when your friends are gone
When you're holding on for someone to leave with
Those nights when you crave someone
To be there at dawn, to wake with, 'cause aren't we all just
Looking for a little bit of hope these days?
Looking for somebody you can wake up with?
Looking for a little bit of hope these days?
We are, we are

[Verse 2]
Pulling at my t-shirt, your hands everywhere
Rising, rising, rising
As you trip and fall, dragging me up the stairs
What's your, what's your name, now?

[Pre-Chorus]
You try to get to Heaven on a night like this
But you, you never get to Heaven on a night like this

[Chorus]
Those nights when your friends are gone
When you're holding on for someone to leave with
Those nights when you crave someone
To be there at dawn, to wake with, 'cause aren't we all just
Looking for a little bit of hope these days?
Looking for somebody you can wake up with?
Looking for a little bit of hope these days?
We are, we are

[Bridge]
The lights, the lights, the lights
They cut a path across the room
The lights, the lights, the lights
A blinding look from me to you
And I'll be your rabbit in the headlights
We'll never get to Heaven
I'll be your rabbit in the headlights
We'll never get to Heaven

[Chorus]
Those nights when your friends are gone
When you're holding on for someone to leave with
Those nights when you crave someone
To be there at dawn, to wake with, 'cause aren't we all just
Looking for a little bit of hope these days?
Looking for somebody you can wake up with?
Looking for a little bit of hope these days?
We are, we are

[Outro]
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Yeah, yeah
From my brain[Intro]
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh

[Verse 1]
Walking out into the dark, cutting out a different path
Lead by a beating heart
All the people of the town cast their eyes right to the ground
In matters of the heart

[Pre-Chorus]
The night was all you had
You ran into the night from all you had
Found yourself a path up on the ground
You ran into the night; you can't be found

[Chorus 1]
But this is your heart
Can you feel it? Can you feel it?
Pumps through your veins
Can you feel it? Can you feel it?

[Verse 2]
Summer evening breezes blew, drawing voices deep from you
Lead by your beating heart
What a year and what a night, what terrifying final sights
Put out your beating heart

[Pre-Chorus]
The night was all you had
You ran into the night from all you had
Found yourself a path up on the ground
You ran into the night; you can't be found

[Chorus 1]
But, this is your heart
Can you feel it? Can you feel it?
Pumps through your veins
Can you feel it? Can you feel it?

[Bridge]
If you had your gun
Would you shoot it at the sky?
Why--to see where it would fall
Or will you come down at all?

If you had your gun
Would you shoot it at the sky?
Why--to see where your bullet would fall
Or will you come down at all?

[Chorus 1]
This is your heart
Can you feel it? Can you feel it?
Pumps through your veins
Can you feel it? Can you feel it?

[Chorus 2]
This is your racing heart
Can you feel it? Can you feel it?
Pumps through your veins
Can you feel it? Can you feel it?[Verse 1]
Moving along
At a pace unknown to man
Go, go, go, go, go, go, g-go-oh-oh
Go, go, go, go, go-oh

[Pre-Chorus]
And you thought the lions were bad; well, they tried to kill my brothers
And for every king that died, oh, they would crown another
And it's harder than you think telling dreams from one another
And you thought the lions were bad; well, they tried to kill my brothers

[Chorus]
And felled in the night by the ones you think you love
They will come for you
And felled in the night by the ones you think you love
They will come for you

[Verse 2]
Dreaming along
At a pace you'll understand
Go, go, go, go, go, go, g-go-oh-oh
No, no, no, no, no-oh

[Pre-Chorus]
And you thought the lions were bad; well, they tried to kill my brothers
And for every king that died, oh, they would crown another
And it's harder than you think, telling dreams from one another
And you thought the lions were bad; well, they tried to kill my brothers

[Chorus]
And felled in the night by the ones you think you love
They will come for you
Felled in the night by the ones you think you love
They will come for you

[Bridge]
Oh, to see
What it means to be free
Of the shackles and the dream
That you claim to see

[Chorus]
And felled in the night by the ones you think you love
They will come for you
Felled in the night by the ones you think you love
They will come for you

[Chorus]
And felled in the night by the ones you think you love
They will come for you
Felled in the night by the ones you think you love
They will come for you

[Outro]
And felled in the night by the ones you think you love
Felled in the night by the ones you think you love
Felled in the night by the ones you think you love
Love[Intro: Dan Smith]
Ooh, I'm not ready
Ooh, I'm not ready
Ooh, I'm not ready
Ooh, I'm not ready

[Verse 1: Dan Smith]
Snakes are biting at my heels
The worries that refuse to let us go
Ive been kicking them away
And hoping not to let them take control

[Pre-Chorus 1: Dan Smith]
Ooh, Im not ready
Drink to escape their bites
Show me distraction
Even for just one night

[Chorus: Dan Smith]
'Cause it's easier to bury
My head in the sand sometimes
Yes, it's easier to bury
My head in the sand sometimes
And I know, I know, I know
It's not the right way to go
But I pray for the ground to swallow me who-ole
Ooh, I'm not ready
Ooh, I'm not ready

[Verse 2: Dan Smith]
Now these days are feeling dark
We're struggling to figure out last year
When the woman on the news
Keeps saying things that no one wants to hear

[Pre-Chorus 2: Dan Smith]
Ooh, Im not ready
Drink to escape our minds
Show me distraction
Even for just one night

[Chorus: Dan Smith]
'Cause it's easier to bury
My head in the sand sometimes
Yes, it's easier to bury
My head in the sand sometimes
And I know, I know, I know
It's not the right way to go
But I pray for the ground to swallow me who-ole
Yes, I pray for the ground to swallow me who-o-ole
Ooh, I'm not ready
Ooh, I'm not ready

[Intermezzo]
"Come on, boys. Let's go tear this place apart!
(Woo, Oh!)"

[Bridge: Kyle Simmons]
'Cause I know life is simple when
I can just ignore it all
'Cause I know, 'cause I know, 'cause I know
Life is simple when
I can just ignore it all
'Cause I know, 'cause I know, 'cause I know

[Pre-Chorus 3: Dan Smith, Kyle Simmons]
If Im not ready ('Cause I know, 'cause I know, 'cause I know)
Snakes will consume me whole ('Cause I know, 'cause I know, 'cause I know)
If I'm not steady ('Cause I know, 'cause I know, 'cause I know)
Maybe they'll take control ('Cause I know, 'cause I know, 'cause I know)

[Chorus: Dan Smith]
But it's easier to bury
My head in the sand sometimes
Yes, it's easier to bury
My head in the sand sometimes
I know, I know, I know
It's not the right way to go
But I pray for the ground to swallow me who-ole
Yes, I know, I know, I know
It's not the right way to go
But I pray for the ground to swallow me who-o-ole[Verse 1]
An act of kindness
Is what you show to me
None more than I can take
Oh none more than I can take
Kindness is what you showed to me
It holds me 'til I ache
Overflow, and start to break

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Oh, I got a feeling this'll shake me down
Oh, I'm kind of hoping this will turn me round

[Chorus]
And now it follows me every day
And now it follows me every day
And now it follows me every day
And now it follows me every day, every day, every day
And now it follows me every day
And now it follows me every day
And now it follows me every day
And now it follows me every day, every day, every day

[Verse 2]
An act of kindness
Is what you showed to me
It caught me by surprise in this town of glass and ice
Kindness, so many people passed me by
But you warmed me to my core, and you left me wanting more

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Oh I got a feeling this'll shake me down
Oh I'm kind of hoping this'll turn me round
Oh I got a feeling that however small
Oh I'm kind of hoping this will reach my soul

[Chorus]
And now it follows me every day
And now it follows me every day
And now it follows me every day
And now it follows me every day, every day, every day
And now it follows me every day
And now it follows me every day
And now it follows me every day
And now it follows me every day, every day, every day

[Bridge]
Oh, my back's up against the wall
I feel guilty, I feel guilty
And you want nothing in return
I feel guilty, I feel guilty
Oh, my back's up against the wall
I feel guilty, I feel guilty
And you want nothing in return
I feel guilty, I feel guilty

[Chorus]
And now it follows me every day
And now it follows me every day
And now it follows me every day
And now it follows me every day, every day, every day
And now it follows me every day
And now it follows me every day
And now it follows me every day
And now it follows me every day, every day, every day
(Now it follows me everyday)

[Outro]
Oh, my back's up against the wall
I feel guilty, I feel guilty
And you want nothing in return
I feel guilty, I feel guilty[Verse 1]
Rhythm is a dancer; it's a souls companion
People feel it everywhere
Lift your hands and voices; free your mind and join us
You can feel it in the air
Oh oh, it's a passion
Oh oh, you can feel it in the air
Oh oh, it's a passion
Oh oh, oh, oh, oh

[Verse 2]
(This is the rhythm) You can put some joy up on my face
Oh, sunshine in an empty place
Take me too, turn to
And babe, I'll make you stay
Oh, I can ease you of your pain
Feel you give me love again
Round and round we go
Each time I hear you say:

[Chorus]
"This is the rhythm of the night
The night
Oh, yeah
The rhythm of the night
This is the rhythm of my life
My life
Oh, yeah
The rhythm of my life"

[Chorus]
This is the rhythm of the night
The night
Oh, yeah
The rhythm of the night
This is the rhythm of my life
My life
Oh, yeah
The rhythm of my life

[Verse 2]
Won't you teach me how to love and learn?
There'll be nothing left for me to yearn
Think of me and burn
And let me hold your hand
I don't want to face the world in tears
Please think again, I'm on my knees
Sing that song to me
No reason to repent

[Chorus]
This is the rhythm of the night
The night
Oh, yeah
The rhythm of the night
This is the rhythm of my life
My life
Oh, yeah
The rhythm of my life

[Chorus]
This is the rhythm of the night
The night
Oh, yeah
The rhythm of the night
This is the rhythm of my life
My life
Oh, yeah
The rhythm of my life

This is the rhythm of the night
The night
Oh, yeah
The rhythm of the night
This is the rhythm of my life
My life
Oh, yeah
The rhythm of my life

[Outro]
This is the rhythm of the night
The night
Oh, yeah...[Verse 1]
So her fingers ran away with themselves
'Till everything was documented
Her mind it was reaching out
To put into words what their bodies had done

[Chorus]
They lie together, oh
Oil on water
And they lie upon her, oh
Someone's daughter

[Verse 2]
It's a catalogue of modern mistakes
Her words and legs wrapped around each man
Leaving stories like digital crumbs
As she turns these nights into literature

[Chorus]
They lie together, oh
Oil on water
And they lie upon her, oh
Someone's daughter

[Verse 3]
When they leave she sets about writing down
Awkward body games all over town
Warm affection runs through every word
We're screens away but we're laughing with her

[Chorus]
They lie together, oh
Oil on water
And they lie upon her, oh
Someone's daughter

They lie upon her, oh
Oil on water[Refrain 1]
Ooh, ooh ooh ooh
Ooh, ooh-ooh ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh ooh, ooh ooh ooh
Ooh, ooh-ooh ooh-ooh

[Verse 1]
There's an albatross around your neck
All the things you've said and the things you've done
Can you carry it with no regrets?
Can you stand the person you've become?

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, there's a light
Oh oh oh, there's a light

[Chorus 1]
Your albatross
Let it go, let it go
Oh, your albatross
Shoot it down, shoot it down

When you just can't shake the heavy weight
Of living...

[Verse 2]
Stepping forward out into the day
Shrugging off the dust and memory
Though it's soaring still above your head
It is out of sight and none shall see

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, there's a light
Oh oh oh, there's a light

[Chorus 2]
Your albatross
Let it go, let it go
Oh, your albatross
Shoot it down, shoot it down

When you just can't shake the heavy weight
Of living
When you just can't seem to shake the weight
Of living

[Bridge]
It's the sun in your eyes
In your eyes
It's the sun in your eyes
In your eyes

It's the sun in your eyes
In your eyes
It's the sun in your eyes
In your eyes

[Chorus]
Your albatross
Let it go, let it go
Oh, your albatross
Shoot it down, shoot it down

When you just can't shake the heavy weight
Of living
When you just can't seem to shake the weight
Of living

[Outro]
The weight of living
The weight of living
The weight of living
The weight of living

Ooh, ooh ooh ooh
Ooh, ooh-ooh ooh-ooh

"What the fuck are y'all doing is the question
This is the question"

[Verse 1]
The animals break out their cages
Now chaos is raining down around us
But here we stand with our arms folded
Do you wanna be free of this?

[Verse 2]
When panic rises like the oceans
We just keep on flicking through the stations
'Cause if we don't post it doesn't happen
Oh I wanna be free of this

[Pre-Chorus]
Have you and I been sleepwalking way too long?
Won't someone pour ice water on me?

[Chorus]
It only matters if we care now, if you're way beyond that
Then I'm gonna dust you off of my shoulders
And I remember when we cared now, if you're way beyond that
Then I'm gonna dust you off of my shoulders, my shoulders

[Verse 3]
Movies and news on television
Sometimes it's hard to tell the difference, oh
When real life's more fucked up than fiction
Do you wanna be free of this?

[Pre-Chorus]
Have you and I been sleepwalking way too long?
Won't someone pour ice water on me?

[Chorus]
It only matters if we care now, if you're way beyond that
Then I'm gonna dust you off of my shoulders
And I remember when we cared now, if you're way beyond that
Then I'm gonna dust you off of my shoulders

[Bridge]
I don't wanna play dumb (dumb), anymore
I just wanna feel something (something), like before
I don't wanna feel numb (numb), anymore
I just wanna feel something (something), like before

[Chorus]
It only matters if we care now, if you're way beyond that
Then I'm gonna dust you off of my shoulders
And I remember when we cared now, if you're way beyond that
Then I'm gonna dust you off of my shoulders, my shoulders

[Outro]
"Television viewers have the choice of watching the tragedy play out from the safety and comfort of their living rooms. But victims have to respond to the pressure of the media while still in shock"

If you're way beyond that
Then I'm gonna dust you off of my shoulders, my shoulders[Verse 1]
Love me, leave me
Rhythm of the evening, chasing a good time
London's burning
If the world is ending, let's stay up all night

[Pre-Chorus]
Do you remember what you said to me?
'Cause we lost track of time
Yeah, we lost track of time
You always let me down so tenderly
So live fast and die young and stay forever numb

[Chorus]
You said that maybe this is where it ends
Take a bow for the bad decisions that we made
Bad decisions that we made
And if we're going down in flames
Take a bow for the bad decisions that we made
Bad decisions that we made

[Post-Chorus]
So we'll make the same mistakes
Till the morning breaks
So we'll make the same mistakes
Till the morning breaks

[Verse 2]
I'm here feeling lower than the sterling
How'd you look so good?
Groundhog evening, dancing on the ceiling
Kubrick's Hollywood

[Pre-Chorus]
Do you remember what you said to me?
'Cause we lost track of time
Yeah, we lost track of time

[Chorus]
You said that maybe this is where it ends
Take a bow for the bad decisions that we made
Bad decisions that we made
And if we're going down in flames
Take a bow for the bad decisions that we made
Bad decisions that we made

[Post-Chorus]
So we'll make the same mistakes
Till the morning breaks
So we'll make the same mistakes
Till the morning breaks

[Bridge]
Now we find ourselves lying around here
Always find ourselves lying around here
Down here
(And we make the same mistakes)
(Till the morning breaks)
Ooh
(And we make the same mistakes)
(Till the morning breaks)

[Chorus]
You said that maybe this is where it ends
(Maybe this is where it ends)
Take a bow for the bad decisions that we made
Bad decisions that we made
And if we're going down in flames
Take a bow for the bad decisions that we made
Bad decisions that we made

[Post-Chorus]
So we'll make the same mistakes
Till the morning breaks (Ooh)
So we'll make the same mistakes
Till the morning breaks

[Outro]
Do you remember what you said to me?
'Cause we lost track of time
Yeah, we lost track of time[Intro]
"So the question is, why doesn't he grow up?
Why does he still behave as a child?
How can we help him get rid of these leftovers from childish behavior?"

[Verse 1]
This is the winter of our youth
Oh, but I'm not there yet
I've got nostalgia running through me
And I don't like it

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Oh my, my, my, my
Now I can almost taste it, taste it
But I just hope we didn't waste it away

[Chorus]
I know the winter's getting colder
But why, just 'cause we're a little older do
I relive it, I relive it all?
I'm pedaling backwards
Even if I'm pedaling alone
Can't help it
I relive it, I relive it all

[Verse 2]
It's 4am, here comes the fear
I'm not prepared yet
And when we pick over the past we
Glorify it

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Oh my, my, my, my
I hope I wasn't wasted, wasted
And I, I hope I didn't drink it away

[Chorus]
I know the winter's getting colder
But why, just 'cause we're a little older do
I relive it, I relive it all?
I'm pedaling backwards
Even if I'm pedaling alone
Can't help it
I relive it, I relive it all

[Bridge]
I let myself bathe in the past for way, way, way too long
And now it seems I've drunk too much to give you what you want

[Chorus]
I know the winter's getting colder
But why, just 'cause we're a little older do
I relive it, I relive it all?
I'm pedaling backwards
Even if I'm pedaling alone
Can't help it
I relive it, I relive it all

[Outro]
Can't help it
I relive it, I relive it all
Can't help it
I relive it, I relive it all
I'm pedaling backwards
Even if I'm pedaling alone
Can't help it
I relive it, I relive it all[Intro]
(A million pieces)

[Verse 1]
I breathe in hard
Don't speak, 'cause it's like a bitter pill
You blow my mind
It makes my heart beat
Harder, harder, harder, harder, hard
The king's a clown
No one is laughing, it's not a drill
Don't look outside
The world is ending
Faster, faster, faster, faster, fast

[Pre-Chorus]
The echoes of that news ring loud
(The echoes, the echoes)
No sound can ever drown it out
(The echoes)

[Chorus]
It breaks my heart
Breaks my heart into
A million pieces, oh
It breaks my heart into
A million pieces
If it's gonna break me
Won't you let me go?
Leave it till the morning
I don't wanna know
Breaks my heart
Breaks my heart into
A million pieces
(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
A million pieces

[Verse 2]
We're too far gone
Nothing I say will mean anything
Just drink, fuck, dance
Right through disaster
I don't want to talk about it now

[Pre-Chorus]
The echoes of that news ring loud
(The echoes, the echoes)
No music ever drowns it out
(The echoes)

[Chorus]
It breaks my heart
Breaks my heart into
A million pieces, oh
It breaks my heart into
A million pieces
If it's gonna break me
Won't you let me go?
Leave it till the morning
I don't wanna know
Breaks my heart
Breaks my heart into
A million pieces
(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
A million pieces

[Bridge]
Get fear and loathing out your mind
And don't pull me, don't pull me down from the ceiling

[Chorus]
It breaks my heart
It breaks my heart into
A million pieces, oh
It breaks my heart into
A million pieces
If it's gonna break me
Won't you let me go?
Leave it till the morning
I don't wanna know
Breaks my heart
Breaks my heart into
A million pieces

Staring down the barrel of a hundred tons
(We're riding the wave)
It might be getting older, but the night's still young
(We're riding the wave)
We never, never give up on the lost boy life
(We're riding the wave)
So here we are, escaping from the world outside
(We're riding the wave)

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, what would your mother say if she could see what we're doing now?
Oh, what would your mother say if she could hear what we talk about?

[Chorus]
The waves are crashing down on you and me again, again, again
The waves are crashing down on you and me
I'll see you on the other side
Get carried, get carried away, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Caught up in, caught up in the waves

[Verse 2]
Suddenly we're fallin' through the twilight zone
(We're riding the wave)
Watch the party playing out in slow motion
(We're riding the wave)
So tie a ribbon 'round my arm and throw me in
(We're riding the wave)
Is it an apocalypse or nihilism on your lips? We sink or swim
(We're riding the wave)

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, what would your mother say if she could see what we're doing now?
Oh, what would your mother say if she could hear what we talk about? (Hey)

[Chorus]
The waves are crashing down on you and me again, again, again
The waves are crashing down on you and me
I'll see you on the other side
Get carried, get carried away, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Caught up in, caught up in the waves

[Bridge]
The air hit me on the way out
Did it make me more sober or make me more drunk?
I couldn't quite remember the vision of you and of me
The air hit me on the way out
Did it make me more sober or make me more drunk?
I couldn't quite remember the vision of you and of me

[Chorus]
The waves are crashing down on you and me again, again, again
The waves are crashing down on you and me
I'll see you on the other side
Get carried, get carried away, oh-oh-oh-oh
Caught up in, caught up in the waves

[Outro]
They're crashing down, they're crashing down, oh
(The waves)
They're crashing down on you and me
I'll see you on the other side
(We're riding the wave)[Verse 1]
You took me to your favourite place
On Earth
To see the tree they cut down
Ten years from your birth

Our fingers traced in circles
Round its history
We brushed our hands right back in time
Through centuries

[Pre-Chorus]
As you held me down
You said:

[Chorus]
"I'll see you in the future
When we're older
And we are full of stories
To be told

Crossing my heart
And hope to die
I'll see you with your
Laughter lines"

[Verse 2]
Changes on our hands
And on our faces, oh, oh
Memories are mapped out
By the lines we'll trace

[Pre-Chorus]
As you held me down
You said:

[Chorus]
"I'll see you in the future
When we're older
And we are full of stories
To be told

Crossing my heart
And hope to die
I'll see you with your
Laughter lines"

[Bridge]
Ashen faces in cold breeze
Ashen faces in cold breeze
Armed with stories, you will leave, oh oh
Armed with stories, you will leave

[Chorus]
"I'll see you in the future
When we're older
And we are full of stories
To be told

Crossing my heart
And hope to die
I'll see you with your
Laughter lines"

[Outro]
I'll see you in the future
When we're old
I'll see you in the future
When we're old[Intro: Bowling for Soup]
There's a hundred and four days of summer vacation
And school comes along just to end it
So the annual problem for our generation
Is finding a good way to spend it
Like maybe

[Verse: Bowling for Soup, Phineas & Candace]
Building a rocket or fighting a mummy
Or climbing up the Eiffel Tower
Discovering something that doesn't exist
Or giving a monkey a shower
Surfing tidal waves, creating nanobots
Or locating Frankenstein's brain (It's over here!)
Finding a dodo bird, painting a continent
Or driving your sister insane (Phineas!)

[Outro: Bowling for Soup, Phineas, Candace]
As you can see, there's a whole lot of stuff to do
Before school starts this fall (Come on, Perry!)
So stick with us 'cause Phineas and Ferb are gonna do it all
So stick with us 'cause Phineas and Ferb are gonna do it all
Mom! Phineas and Ferb are making a title sequence![Verse 1]
Debbie just hit the wall, she never had it all
One Prozac a day, husband's a CPA
Her dreams went out the door when she turned 24
Only been with one man, what happened to her plan?
She was gonna be an actress, she was gonna be a star
She was gonna shake her ass on the hood of Whitesnakes car
Her yellow SUV is now the enemy
Looks at her average life, and nothing has been alright

[Chorus]
Since Bruce Springsteen, Madonna, way before Nirvana
There was U2 and Blondie, and music still on MTV
Her two kids in high school, they tell her that shes uncool
Cause she's still preoccupied with 19, 19, 1985, 1985

[Verse 2]
Shes seen all the classics, she knows every line
Breakfast Club, Pretty in Pink, even Saint Elmos Fire
She rocked out to Wham, not a big Limp Bizkit fan
Thought shed get a hand on a member of Duran Duran
Wheres the mini-skirt made of snake skin?
And whos the other guy that's singing in Van Halen?
When did reality become TV?
Whatever happened to sitcoms, game shows?

[Chorus]
On the radio was Springsteen, Madonna, way before Nirvana
There was U2 and Blondie, and music still on MTV
Her two kids in high school, they tell her that shes uncool
Cause she's still preoccupied with 19, 19, 1985

[Bridge]
She hates time, make it stop
When did Mtley Cre become classic rock?
And when did Ozzy become an actor?
Please make this stop, stop, stop

[Chorus]
And bring back Springsteen, Madonna, way before Nirvana
There was U2 and Blondie, and music still on MTV
Her two kids in high school, they tell her that shes uncool
Cause she's still preoccupied with 19, 19, 1985
Bruce Springsteen, Madonna, way before Nirvana
There was U2 and Blondie, and music still on MTV
Her two kids in high school, they tell her that shes uncool
Cause she's still preoccupied with 19, 19, 1985[Verse 1]
Eight o'clock, Monday night, and I'm waitin'
To finally talk to a girl a little cooler than me
Her name is Nona, she's a rocker with a nose ring
She wears a two way, but I'm not quite sure what that means

[Pre-Chorus]
And when she walks
All the wind blows and the angels sing
But she doesn't notice me

[Chorus 1]
'Cause she's watchin' wrestling
Creamin' over tough guys
Listenin' to rap metal
Turntables in her eyes
It's like a bad movie
She's lookin' through me
If you were me, then you'd be
Screamin', "Someone shoot me!"
As I fail miserably
Tryna get the girl all the bad guys want
'Cause she's the girl all the bad guys want

[Verse 2]
She likes the Godsmack and I like Agent Orange
Her CD changer's full of singers that are mad at their dad
She says she'd like to score some reefer and a forty
She'll never know that I'm the best that she'll never have

[Pre-Chorus]
And when she walks
All the wind blows and the angels sing
She'll never notice me

[Chorus 2]
'Cause she's watchin' wrestling
Creamin' over tough guys
Listenin' to rap metal
Turntables in her eyes
She likes 'em with a mustache
Racetrack season pass
Drivin' in a Trans-Am
Does a mullet make a man?
It's like a bad movie
She's lookin' through me
If you were me, then you'd be
Screamin', "Someone shoot me!"
As I fail miserably
Tryna get the girl all the bad guys want
'Cause she's the girl all the bad guys want
'Cause she's the girl all the bad guys want
'Cause she's the girl all the bad guys want

[Bridge]
There she goes again
With fishnets on, and dreadlocks in her hair
She broke my heart, I wanna be sedated
All I wanted was to see her naked!

[Chorus 3]
Now I'm watchin' wrestling
Tryna be a tough guy
Listenin' to rap metal
Turntables in my eyes
I can't grow a mustache
And I ain't got no season pass
All I got's a moped (Moped, moped)
It's like a bad movie
She's lookin' through me
If you were me, then you'd be
Screamin', "Someone shoot me!"
As I fail miserably
Tryna get the girl all the bad guys want

[Outro]
'Cause she's the girl all the bad guys want
'Cause she's the girl all the bad guys want
'Cause she's the girl all the bad guys want
'Cause she's the girl all the bad guys want
(There she goes again)
'Cause she's the girl all the bad guys want
'Cause she's the girl all the bad guys want
(There she goes again)
'Cause she's the girl all the bad guys want
'Cause she's the girl all the bad guys want3...2...1 (Gotta Blast)
[Verse 1]
Into the stars
To buy candy bars
Rides a kid with
A knack for inventions
A super powered-mind
(Bark Bark) mechanical K-9
He rescues the day
From your destruction

[Pre-Chorus]
He's gotta save the world
And get to school on time
So many things to do
And not much time
Oh so off the ground
Up in the air
Out into the atmosphere

[Chorus]
Who can we count on?
Jimmy Neutron
(Jimmy Neutron)
Who can we count on?
Jimmy Neutron
Who can we count on?
Jimmy Neutron

[Verse 2]
No matter where you are
You know he can't be far
Watching the world
Through X-Ray vision
And wherever he's around
Where adventure can be found
You know that
Jimmy Neutron's on a mission

[Pre-Chorus]
He's gotta save the world
And get to school on time
So many things to do
And not much time
Oh so off the ground
Up in the air
And out into the atmosphere

[Chorus]
Who can we count on?
Jimmy Neutron
Who can we count on?
Jimmy Neutron
Who can we count on?
Jimmy Neutron
Who can we count on?
Jimmy Neutron
Who can we count on?

It's Jimmy Neutron![Intro]
Hey!
Oh oh, oh oh oh-oh, oh oh oh-oh, oh oh oh-oh
Hey!
Oh oh, oh oh oh-oh, oh oh oh-oh, oh oh oh-oh
Hey!

[Verse 1]
Four years, you think, for sure
Thats all youve got to endure
All the total dicks
All the stuck-up chicks
So superficial, so immature
Then when, you graduate
Ya take a look around and you say Hey, wait!
This is the same as where I just came from
I thought it was over! Aw, thats just great"

[Chorus 1]
The whole damned world is just as obsessed
With whos the best dressed and whos having sex
Whos got the money, who gets the honeys
Whos kinda cute and whos just a mess
And you still dont have the right look
And you dont have the right friends
Nothing changes but the faces, the names and the trends
High school never ends
Oh oh, oh oh oh-oh, oh oh oh-oh, oh oh oh-oh
Hey!
Oh oh, oh oh oh-oh, oh oh oh-oh, oh oh oh-oh
Hey!

[Verse 2]
Check out the popular kids
Youll never guess what Jessica did!
And how did Mary Kate lose all that weight?
And Katie had a baby so I guess Toms straight!
And the only thing that matters
Is climbing up that social ladder
Still care about your hair and the car you drive
Doesnt matter if youre 16 or 35
Reese Witherspoon, shes the prom queen
Bill Gates, captain of the chess team
Jack Black, the clown, Brad Pitt, the quarterback
Seen it all before
I want my money back!

[Chorus 2]
The whole damned world is just as obsessed
With whos the best dressed and whos having sex
Whos in the club and whos on the drugs
Whos throwing up before they digest
And you still dont have the right look
And you dont have the right friends
And you still listen to the same shit you did back then
High school never ends
Oh oh, oh oh oh-oh, oh oh oh-oh, oh oh oh-oh
(High school never ends)

[Chorus 1]
The whole damned world is just as obsessed
With whos the best dressed and whos having sex
Whos got the money, who gets the honeys
Whos kinda cute and whos just a mess
And I still dont have the right look
And I still have the same three friends
And Im pretty much the same as I was back then
High school never ends

[Outro]
(Oh oh, oh oh oh-oh, oh oh oh-oh, oh oh oh-oh)
High school never ends
(Oh oh, oh oh oh-oh, oh oh oh-oh, oh oh oh-oh)
High school never ends

Here we go again...

Stacy's mom has got it goin' on
Stacy's mom has got it goin' on
Stacy's mom has got it goin' on
Stacy, can I come over after school? (after school)
We can hang around by the pool (hang by the pool)
Did your mom get back from her business trip? (business trip)
Is she there, or is she trying to give me the slip? (give me the slip)
You know, I'm not the little boy that I used to be
I'm all grown up now, baby can't you see
Stacy's mom has got it goin' on
She's all I want and I've waited for so long
Stacy, can't you see you're just not the girl for me
I know it might be wrong but I'm in love with Stacy's mom
Stacy's mom has got it goin' on
Stacy's mom has got it goin' on
Stacy, do you remember when I mowed your lawn? (mowed your lawn)
Your mom came out with just a towel on (towel on)
I could tell she likes me from the way she stared (the way she stared)
And the way she said, "You missed a spot over there" (a spot over there)
And I know that you think it's just a fantasy
But since your dad walked out, your mom could use a guy like me
Stacy's mom has got it goin' on
She's all I want, and I've waited for so long
Stacy, can't you see you're just not the girl for me
I know it might be wrong
But I'm in love with Stacy's mom
Stacy's mom has got it goin' on
She's all I want and I've waited for so long
Stacy can't you see your just not the girl for me
I know it might be wrong but oh oh
(I know it might be wrong)
I'm in love with (Stacy's mom oh oh)
(Stacys mom oh oh)
I'm in love with Stacy's mom[Intro]
Rock!

[Verse 1]
She works at Hot Topic
His heart: microscopic
She thinks that it's love
But to him, it's sex
He listens to emo
But Fat Mike's his hero
His bank account's zero
What comes next?

[Pre-Chorus]
Same song; different Chorus

[Chorus]
It's stupid, contagious
To be broke and famous
Can someone please save us
From Punk Rock 101?
My Dickies, your sweatpants
My spiked hair, your new Vans
Let's throw up our rock hands
For Punk Rock 101!

[Verse 2]
She bought him a skateboard
A rail-slide, his knee tore
He traded it for drums at the local pawn shop
She left him for staring
At girls and not caring
When she cried 'cause she thought Bon Jovi broke up

[Pre-Chorus]
Same song; second Chorus

[Chorus]
It's stupid, contagious
To be broke and famous
Can someone please save us
From Punk Rock 101?
My Dickies, your sweatpants
My spiked hair, your new Vans
Let's throw up our rock hands
For Punk Rock 101!

[Bridge]
Don't forget the delay
On the very last word
Seven years later
He works as a waiter
She married a trucker
And he's never there
The story never changes
Just the names and faces
Like Tommy and Gina
They're living on a prayer

(Did you just say that?)
I said

[Chorus]
It's stupid, contagious
To be broke and famous
Can someone please save us
From Punk Rock 101?
My Dickies, your sweatpants
My spiked hair, your new Vans
Let's throw up our rock hands
For Punk Rock 101!

[Outro]
It's stupid, contagious
To be broke and famous
Can someone please save us
From Punk Rock 101?
My Dickies, your sweatpants
My spiked hair, your new Vans
Let's throw up our rock hands
For Punk Rock 101!
It's stupid, contagious (same song, different chorus)
To be broke and famous
Can someone please save us (same song, different chorus)
From Punk Rock 101?
My Dickies, your rock hands (same song, different chorus)
My spiked hair, your new Vans
Let's shoplift some sweatpants (same song, different chorus)
For Punk Rock 101![Verse 1]
I almost got drunk at school at 14
Where I almost made out with the Homecoming Queen
Who almost went on to be Miss Texas
But lost to a slut with much bigger breastes
I almost dropped out to move to L.A
Where I was almost famous for almost a day

[Chorus]
And I almost had you
But I guess that doesn't cut it
Almost loved you
I almost wish you would've loved me too

[Verse 2]
I almost held up a grocery store
Where I almost did 5 years and then 7 more
Cause I almost got popped for a fight with a thug
Cause he almost made off with a bunch of the drugs
That I almost got hooked on cause you ran away
And I wish I would've had the nerve to ask you to stay

[Chorus]
And I almost had you
But I guess that doesn't cut it
Almost had you
And I didn't even know it
You kept me guessin'
And now I'm destined
To spend my time missin' you
I almost wish you would've loved me too

[Verse 3]
Here I go thinking about all the things I could've done
I'm gonna need a forklift cause all the baggage ways a ton
I know we had our problems; I can't remember one

[Bridge]
I almost forgot to say something else
And if I can't fit it in I'll keep it all to myself
I almost wrote a song about you today
But I tore it all up and then I threw it away!

[Chorus]
And I almost had you
But I guess that doesn't cut it
Almost had you
And I didn't even know it
You kept me guessin'
And now I'm destined
To spend my time missin' you
I almost wish you would've loved me too[Verse 1]
She said she needed a break
A little time to think
But then she went to Cleveland
With some guy named Leland
That she met at the bank
There's nothing wrong with Ohio
Except the snow and the rain
I really like Drew Carey
And I'd love to see
The Rock 'n Roll Hall of Fame

[Pre-Chorus]
So when you're done
Doing whatever
And when you're through
Doing whoever
You know Denton County
Will be right here waiting for you

[Chorus]
Come back to Texas
It's just not the same
Since you went away
Before you lose your accent
And forget all about
The Lone Star state
There's a seat for you at the rodeo
And I've got every slow dance saved
Besides the Mexican food sucks
North of here anyway

[Verse 2]
I think I made a mistake
It's not that easy to take
She went to make a deposit
Then she cleaned out her closet
Guess I'll sit here and wait
For her to come back home
(I wish she'd come back home)
It shouldn't take very long
(So long, so long)
I bet she misses the sunrise
And Mrs. Baird's fruit pies
(but I could be wrong)

[Pre-Chorus]
So when you're done
Doing whatever
And when you're through
Doing whoever
You know Denton County
Will be right here waiting for you

[Chorus]
Come back to Texas
It's just not the same
Since you went away
I bet you missed your exit
And drove right on through the Lone Star state
There's a seat for you at the rodeo
And I've got every slow dance saved
Besides the Mexican food sucks north of here anyway

[Bridge]
Troy Aikman wants you back
Willie Nelson wants you back
NASA wants you back
And the Bush twins want you back
Pantera wants you back
And Blue Bell wants you back
I got a premonition
I'm taking a petition
And the whole state's gonna sign

[Chorus]
Come back to Texas
It's just not the same
Since you went away
Before you lose your accent
And forget all about
The Lone Star state
There's a seat for you at the rodeo
And I've got every slow dance saved

[Chorus]
Come back to Texas
It's just not the same
Since you went away
Before you lose your accent
And forget all about
The Lone Star state
There's a seat for you at the rodeo
And I've got every slow dance saved
Besides the Mexican food sucks
North of here anyway

[Outro]
Besides the Mexican food sucks
North of here anyway
Besides the Mexican food sucks
North of here anyway, yeahNr sommarn' har brjat

Och lyssna nu ska ni f hra:

Bygga raketer
Fightas med mumier

Lattja och ha kul
Leta i huven och st
Hitta fglar sm
Mla jorden gul

She saw me for the first time in Columbus
But she was with her friends andIwas in atour bus
A few months later shewas wearing my shirt in a photo shoot
I didn't even know that she was famous
How could someone so pretty be so dangerous?
She's only 5' tall but maybe 5'2" in her wrestling boots

[Pre-Chorus]
And I hear she can even sing
She's the champ of everything

[Chorus]
(Hey!)
Why can't every girl be more like Alexa Bliss?
(Hey!)
How can a chick on TV make me feel like this?
She's got a finishing move called Twisted Bliss
And it's like my heart is caught in a sleeper hold
Woah-oh-oh
Why can't every girl be more like Alexa Bliss?

[Verse 2]
She says some really mean stuff to the other wrestlers
Some say they hate her but they just don't get her
And if you try to bring her down, she'll say "Bless your heart"
Her favorite song's "Girl All the Bad Guys Want"
Sometimes she cheats but she never gets caught, yeah
She's got a pig named Larry-Steve and he's so smart

[Pre-Chorus 2]
I love to watch her in the ring
To me, she's the champ of everything

[Chorus]
(Hey!)
Why can't every girl be more like Alexa Bliss?
(Hey!)
How can a chick on TV make me feel like this?
She's got a finishing move called Twisted Bliss
And it's like my heart is caught in a sleeper hold
Woah-oh-oh
Why can't every girl be more like Alexa Bliss?

[Interlude]

[Chorus]
(Hey!)
Why can't every girl be more like Alexa Bliss?
(Hey!)
How can a chick on TV make me feel like this?
She's got a finishing move called Twisted Bliss
And it's like my heart is caught in a sleeper hold
Woah-oh-oh
Why can't every girl be more like Alexa Bliss?

[Outro]
Alexa Bliss, uh huh
Larry-SteveWhatever happened to chivalry?
When did it all break down?
Seems like everyone's selling their bullshit in this town
What ever happened to loyalty?
Nobody's got your back
Is it your friends or is it your enemies on the attack?

Everybody wants to be something they're not
And have shit they ain't got

[Chorus]
Don't be a dick
Don't be an asshole
Just be nice
You don't have to be that guy
Show some respect
Just be a person
Love one another
You don't need a reason why
Don't be a dick
Don't be a dick

What the fuck is the problem
With people living the truth?
Tell me what somebody's happiness has to do with you
What is the obsession
With always being right?
It's not always win or lose, it's not black or white

Nobody seems to have it figured out just yet
It's not that hard to get

[Chorus]
Don't be a dick
Don't be an asshole
Just be nice
You don't have to be that guy
Show some respect
Just be a person
Love one another
You don't need a reason why
Don't be a dick
Don't be a dick

Whatever happened to honesty?
You live a fucking lie
So what, you fake it 'til you make it and then you die?

[Chorus]
Don't be a dick
Don't be an asshole
Just be nice
You don't have to be that guy
Show some respect
Just be a person
Love one another
You don't need a reason why

[Chorus]
Don't be a dick
Don't be an asshole
Just be nice
You don't have to be that guy
Show some respect
Just be a person
Love one another
You don't need a reason why
Don't be a dick
Don't be a dick
Don't be a dick
Don't be a dick[Intro]
There's a hundred and four days of summer vacation
'Til school comes along just to end it
So the annual problem for our generation
Is finding a good way to spend it
Like maybe

[Verse 1]
Building a rocket or fighting a mummy
Or climbing up the Eiffel Tower
Discovering something that doesn't exist
Or giving a monkey a shower
Surfing tidal waves, creating nanobots
Or locating Frankenstein's brain
Finding a dodo bird, painting a continent
Or driving our sister insane

[Chorus]
This could possibly be the best day ever
And the forecast says that tomorrow will likely be
A million and six times better
So make every minute count
Jump up, jump in and seize the day
And let's make sure that in every single possible way
Today is gonna be a great day

[Verse 2]
Crossing the tundra or building a roller coaster
Or skiing down a mountain of beans
Devising a system for remembering everything
Or synchronizing submarines
Racing chariots, taming tiger sharks
Constructing a portal to Mars
Building a time machine, stretching a rubber tree
Or wailing away on guitars

[Chorus]
This could possibly be the best day ever
And the forecast says that tomorrow will likely be
A million and six times better
So make every minute count
Jump up, jump in and seize the day
And let's make sure that in every single possible way
Today is gonna be a great day

[Bridge]
(Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!)
Let's put our heads together and design a master plan
We may miss dinner but I know mom will understand
We've got our mission and some pliers
Yogurt, gumballs and desire
And a pocketful of rubber bands
The manual on handstands
A Unicycle, compass
And a camera that won't focus
And a canteen full of soda
Grab a beach towel
Here we go!
(This is Ferb-tastic!)

[Chorus]
This could possibly be the best day ever
And the forecast says that tomorrow will likely be
A million and six times better
So make every minute count
Jump up, jump in and seize the day
And let's make sure that in every single possible way
(Seriously, this is gonna be great!)
This could possibly be the best day ever
(Today is gonna be a great day)
This could possibly be the best day ever
(Today is gonna be a great day)[Verse 1]
8 o'clock Monday night and I'm on Tinder
I swiped right on a girl a littlecoolerthan me
Her nameis Ava she's got a chokerand a lip kit
She likes YUNGBLUD but I'm not quite sure who that is

[Bridge]
And when she walks
All the wind blows and the angels sing
But she doesn't notice me

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause she's watching UFC
Liking guys with neck tats
Listening to Bring Me
Got Post Malone on Snapchat

[Chorus]
It's like a bad movie
She's looking through me
If you were me then you'd be
Screaming "someone shoot me"
As I fail miserably
Tryna get the girl all the bad guys want
She's the girl all the bad guys want

[Verse 2]
She likes The Walking Dead and I like Stranger Things
Her playlists are full of rappers who are mad at their dad
She said she'd like to score backstage with Lil Uzi
She'll never know that I'm the best that she'll never have

[Bridge]
And when she walks
All the wind blows and the angels sing
She'll never notice me

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause she's watching UFC
Liking guys with neck tats
Listening to Bring Me
Got Post Malone on Snapchat
She likes them with a six pack
New Era snapback
Driving in a Mustang
Always topless on the 'gram

[Chorus]
It's like a bad movie
She's looking through me
If you were me then you'd be
Screaming "someone shoot me"
As I fail miserably
Tryna get the girl all the bad guys want
She's the girl all the bad guys want[Intro]
(This fucking song is all personality)
([Laughing])
(Dude, that's the shit!)

[Verse 1]
Well we've all heard about
How the guys in the band
Weren't the popular kids in school
And now you hate your parents
Cause of the way you turned out
But in the end the blame's on you

And we all sympathize with your torn-apart hearts
And your really artistic worldly views
It sells records when you're sad these days
It's super cool to be mad these days

[Pre-Chorus]
I think rock and roll is really funny
When it's serious

[Chorus]
Don't hate us 'cause we're happy
Don't hate us 'cause we're beautiful
Don't hate us if we make you smile
Or if we go the extra mile
To make someone feel better
On a really shitty day
And if you're hearing what I'm saying then
I want to hear you say, "I'm gay!"
(I'm gay!)
Say, "I'm gay!"
(I'm gay!)
Whooooo!

[Verse 2]
Let's start a movement, let's start it right now
And if you don't know where to start
I can show you, I'm your new team captain
Put your left hand over your heart
And repeat after me...

[Hook]
It's perfectly fine to be a happy individual
(It's perfectly fine to be a happy individual)
Chris, Gary? (Yeah, buddy?) You guys wanna join in?
(Sure. Ah, man. Sorry, dude)
It's perfectly fine to be a happy individual
(It's perfectly fine to be a happy individual)
Very nice. Very - nice

[Chorus]
Don't hate us cause we're happy
Don't hate us cause we're miserable
Don't hate us if we make you smile
Or if we go the extra mile
To make someone feel better on a really shitty day
And if you're hearing what I'm saying then
I want to hear you say, "I'm gay!" (I'm gay!)
Say, "I'm gay!" (I'm gay!)

[Bridge]
That's right, ladies and gentleman!
Pick up the phone
Cause Bowling For Soup is on the line!
And you don't have to be sad anymore!
You don't have to be mad anymore!
We can all join hands and do ring around
The freaking rosie!
In fact, can we can get some "La la"s up in here?

It sells records when you're sad these days
It's super cool to be mad these days
I think rock and roll is really funny
When it's serious
(Yo, where're my "La la"s at?)

[Outro]
La la-la la, la-la la-la
La la la la
La la-la la, la-la la-la
La la la la
La la-la la, la-la la-la
La la la la
La la-la la, la-la la-la
La la la la
La la-la la, la-la la-la[Verse 1]
Is it okay if I speak to you today?
You've been pissed off for a week now
But, nothing I can say could make you look up
Or crack up. Is there anything that I can't do
Anything to show you

[Chorus]
You're a bitch
But, I love you anyway
Oh, oh you can't sing
But you still put me to sleep
Baby, you're a bitch
Hey hey hey hey
You make me sick
But don't ever go away

[Verse 2]
So you tell me that there's nothing left to say
I drive you face the window
Then you're in my face, telling me to grow up
I wish you'd grow up
I can't wait until you fall asleep, I wonder if you know that

[Chorus]
You're a bitch
But, I love you anyway
Oh, oh you can't sing
But you still put me to sleep
Baby, you're a bitch
Hey hey hey hey
You make me sick
But don't ever go away

[8 bars of melodic "la"s]

Well, uh!

[Chorus]
You're a bitch
But I love you anyway
Oh, oh you can't sing
But you still put me to sleep
Baby, you're a bitch
Hey hey hey hey (la la la)
You make me sick (la la la)
But don't ever go away

[Outro]
Yeah, you're a bitch, but I love you anyway
So why don't ya stay?[Intro]
(K-- In the-- And I'm drunk, too)
([Laughing])
(Uh oh oh oh...)
Baby, for years you've been saying
"Why don't you write me a song?"
And I'm like
"I don't know, because I'm not inspired to write you a song!"
But last night I decided
I'm gonna freaking do this!

[Verse 1]
We've been together for so long
And you always asked me why I never wrote a song
All about you and about our love
And about how you're the only one I'm thinking of

[Pre-Chorus]
I've been writing all night
And I got it just right
Here we go!

[Chorus]
You talk too much!
You never shut up!
Everything I do for you is never enough!
You snore, you drool
You talk in your sleep!
Won't get a night's rest until you're Six Feet Deep!
I promised you forever
But we both know
We're never gonna get along
You want it?
You got it!
Here's your freaking song!

[Verse 2]
And all my homies
Have always said
"What you doing with that girl?
She's fucked up in the head!"
My mom don't like you
My dad don't too
And my brother says you look like
The guy from Hsker D

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm just keeping it real
This is just how I feel

[Chorus]
You talk too much!
You never shut up!
Everything I do for you is never enough!
You snore, you drool
You talk in your sleep!
Won't get a night's rest until you're Six Feet Deep!
I promised you forever
But we both know
We're never gonna get along
You want it?
You got it!
Here's your freaking song!

[Bridge]
I get drunk and you get pissed!
You start dreaming I don't exist!
I say yes and you say no!
Just like Katy Perry says, you're Hot and Cold!
With all the shit that we've been through!
This is the best that I can do!
Can I still get lucky tonight?
(Please?)

[Ad-Lib]
These are manners and everything
I, uh, I-I hope you like this song
I spent a lot of time on it
But I didn't spend--
Oh, there's Erik
Just playing, I didn't spend a lot of time on this
But this is the Chorus

[Chorus]
You talk too much!
You never shut up!
Everything I do for you is never enough!
You snore, you drool
You talk in your sleep!
Won't get a night's rest until you're Six Feet Deep!
I promised you forever
But we both know
We're never gonna get along
You want it?
You got it!
Here's your freaking song!
You want it?
You got it!
Here's your freaking song!
You want it?
You got it!
Here's your freaking song!

[Outro]
Okay, I don't know why this is still going...
(You want it? You got it!)
I anticipated this being
(Here's your freaking song!)
3 Minutes long it's still going here...
I don't even know what's happening
(You want it? You got it!)
Anyway, that's the song that I wrote for you it's, it's okay
Evidently its over now, I don't know
I have no idea on the timing of it or anything
And I... uh...
Boy this is sort of an awkward moment here...
I... uh...
I'm gonna be honest, I have to pee[Verse 1]
Well, I know that it's early and it's too hard to think
And the broken empty bottle's a reminder in the sink
But I thought that I should tell you, if it's not too late to say
I can put back all the pieces, they just might not fit the same

[Pre-Chorus]
Cause nothing's worth losing
Especially the chance to make it right

[Chorus]
And I know that we're gonna be fine
And the tattooed mistakes are gonna fade over time
As long as we live, time passes by
And we won't get it back when we die

[Verse 2]
Well, I know it's been years now and I don't look the same
And the hopes and dreams you had for me you thought went down the drain
And the room feels so empty where my pictures used to be
And I can't say that I blame you but you can't blame me

[Pre-Chorus]
Cause nothing's worth losing
Especially the chance to make it right

[Chorus]
And I know that we're gonna be fine
And the tattooed mistakes are gonna fade over time
As long as we live, time passes by
And we won't get it back when we die

[Bridge]
Come over, come over
Cause I gotta know if I am doing this all on my own
Come over, come over
How can I show you if you're not here?

[Chorus]
And I know that we're gonna be fine
And the tattooed mistakes are gonna fade over time
As long as we live, time passes by
And we won't get it back when we die

[Outro]
And I know that we're gonna be fine
(And I know that we're gonna be fine)
And the tattooed mistakes are gonna fade over time
As long as we live, time passes by
And we won't get it back when we die

Come over, come over, whoa-oh
Come over, come over, whoa-oh
Come over, come over...
(I gotta know)
And we won't get it back when we die

Well, I know that it's early...I'm happy again
To be stuck here again
And you're so happy again
To be stuck here again

Now we can laugh about the good 'ol days
Laugh at dumb jokes that you make
It's great to be here and I'm just elated
To be someone you once hated
And it's all so complicated
Maybe this time you can crawl inside your little world
Makeout with another girl
If it were up to me I'd like to

Buy you flowers every day
Make every day a holiday
Carry on and on and on about you
And the things you do
The things you do

I'm so sorry again
You say you're leavin' me again
Cause you're not happy again
Now we're stuck here again
Now you can scream about the little things
Slap me twice across the face
Man it would be great if I could

Buy you flowers every day
Make every day a holiday
Carry on and on and on about you
And the things you do
The things you do
(Alright)

I'd like to buy you flowers every day
Make every day a holiday
Carry on and on and on about you
And the things you do

Me gustaria comprarte flores cada dia
Hacer cada dia una vacacion
Y hablar mas y mas y mas de ti
Y de las cosas que haces

I just said I'd buy you flowers every day
Make every day a holiday
Carry on and on and on about you
And the things you do
The things you do....do....do....do....

Ole!It wasn't supposed to be like this
Another dose of unhappiness
I gave it all and managed to get shot down yet again
So I got drunk, had sex with all your friends
You told me that I should never call your house again

Emily aaahhh
You saved the day
Emily aaahhh
When you threw me away

She was always such a pretty girl nobody like her in the world
A little piece of heavenly that no one else could stand
I see her in my dreams at night I see her when I close my eyes
I just can't seem to shake, Emily

You got your money and I got cast
Outside thrown out on my ass
In the city with no one else
Nowhere else to go
So I hooked up with a model from Singapore
Emily I sure am glad you didn't want me anymore

Emily aaahhh
You saved the day
Emily aaahhh
When you threw me away

She was always such a pretty girl nobody like her in the world
A little piece of heavenly that no one else could stand
I see her in my dreams at night I see her when I close my eyes
I just can't seem to shake, Emily, Emily

She was always such a pretty girl nobody like her in the world
A little piece of heavenly that noone else could stand
I see her in my dreams at night I see her when I close my eyes
I just can't seem to shake, Emily

Emily aaahhh
You saved the day
Emily aaahhh
You saved the day
Emily aaahhh
Emily aaahhh
You saved my assI've never been the kind to walk away
Even when the ship was sinking
But promising forever to a psychopath
Was not the clearest thinking

I can't believe that we've made it this far
Without one of us going to jail
I wouldn't post your bail
No!

[Chorus]
Here we go again
You're turning up the crazy all the way to ten
I can't do this anymore
These are my keys coming out (coming out)
This is my jacket going on
This is me waving to you
I've got shit to do

Shit to do and it don't include you
Shit to do and it don't include you

I didn't mind when you spent my cash
I just made it a tax deduction
I didn't mind when you hung with my friends
But you weren't really supposed to fuck them

I can't believe that we've made it this far
Without one of us ending up dead
At least you're good in bed
Yes!

[Chorus]
Here we go again
You're turning up the crazy all the way to ten
I can't do this anymore
This is me starting the car (I'm in the car)
This is me checking my rearview mirror
This is me blasting the Cre
I've got shit to do

Shit to do and it don't include you
I've got shit to do
Shit to do and it don't include you
I've got shit to do
Shit to do and it don't include you
Yes I do
Shit to do and it don't include you

[Bridge]
I've got shit to do
I've got some songs to write
I've got friends to see
And they've got Miller Lite
I've got hopes and dreams
I've got planes to catch
I've got a show to play
I'm never coming back
I'll start another band
And learn to rollerskate
I'll get some more tattoos
Take your mom on a date
I'll fix the ozone layer
I'll cure all disease
I'll run for president
And there'll be world peace

[Chorus]
Here we go again
You're turning up the crazy all the way to ten
I can't do this anymore
This is me down at the bar (I'm at the bar)
This is me chatting up a college co-ed
This is me getting her number (I've got her number)
This is her waking up in my bed
And I ain't thinking of you
I've got shit to do

Shit to do and it don't include you
I've got shit to do
Shit to do and it don't include you
I've got shit to do
Shit to do and it don't include you
I've got shit to do
Shit to do and it don't include you
And it don't include youIt started with a song that almost didn't come to fruition
She's got a pink Volkswagen, and a husband that went to Princeton

She's not your normal mom
She likes to sing along
To punk rock songs

She doesn't sleep so good anymore, but she's still smiling
Her anxiety is a bitch, and there's no denying

That she's overwhelmed
Just not herself

[Chorus]
Hey Diane, everything is gonna be just fine
You're gonna have an amazing life
I know you're gonna conquer the world
Hey Diane, you're a shooting star, a wish come true
And no matter what you do
I know you're gonna conquer the world, hey Diane

She's everything you'd imagine a good friend should be
She won my heart when she fixed the zipper on my Frank Turner hoodie

Sometimes she feels so sad
I tell her, "It's not so bad."

[Chorus]
Hey Diane, everything is gonna be just fine
You're gonna have an amazing life
I know you're gonna conquer the world
Hey Diane, you're a shooting star, a wish come true
And no matter what you do
I know you're gonna conquer the world, hey Diane

Sometimes the future's so uncertain
Like it was when we first met
Who knows what's behind the curtain
Everybody's got regrets
And I don't know what I'd do without you
You can always count on me
I'm on your side
For the rest of our lives

[Chorus]
Hey Diane, everything is gonna be just fine
You're gonna have an amazing life
I know you're gonna conquer the world
Hey Diane, you're a shooting star, a wish come true
And no matter what you do
I know you're gonna conquer the world

[Chorus]
Hey Diane, everything is gonna be just fine
You're gonna have an amazing life
I know you're gonna conquer the world
Hey Diane, you're a shooting star, a wish come true
And no matter what you do
I know you're gonna conquer the world, hey DianeI'm not lost I just haven't found
Everything I need
I'm not torn I'm just getting it together
I'm not broken don't you mind
The pieces of me
You see scattered on the ground
I swear I'll turn this thing around
I'm not home but I'm sitting
Here in my room
I'm a photograph in need of a zoom
I feel far away
I can't make out the face
It's all blurred since you went away

When you took your keys out
You took a little piece of me

I'm a circle incomplete
I'm a heart that barely beats
All the memories stay forever as tattoos
I'm a star without a sky
I'm hello with no goodbye
I'm the dreams we had that never will come true
That's me with no you

Na na na na na na na na na na na
Na na na na na na na na na

I'm a mark, I'm a mortar
I'm a victim, I'm a jerk
I'm an engine that just doesn't seem to start
I'm a kingdom with no king
I'm a king without a crown
So I fall down on my knees
And I pray nobody sees

You got my attention
Now please come back to me (come back to me)

I'm a circle incomplete
I'm a heart that barely beats
All the memories stay forever as tattoos
I'm a star without a sky
I'm hello with no goodbye
I'm the dreams we had that never will come true
That's me with no you

Can't find the words to fit the melody
But I swear that I could sing it
When you were here with me
I'm all over the place on a scale of 1-10
I'm a C, that's me

I'm not lost I just haven't found
Everything I need
I'm not torn I'm just getting it together

I'm a circle incomplete
I'm a heart that barely beats
All the memories stay forever as tattoos
I'm a star without a sky
I'm hello with no goodbye
I'm the dreams we had that never will come true
That's me with no you

Na na na na na na na na na na na (that's me with no you)
Na na na na na na na na na na na (that's me with no you)

Playing poker Friday nights
Pyromancing off golf cart races
You think that my sister's hot
I accidentally shot your finger
Off your writing hand oh well
You get disability
I broke my leg you laughed so hard
And told the ambulance to stop at the bar

You'll tell the world I'm gay
When you hear me say
That I really and truly feel this way
Not that there's anything wrong with being gay (ooooo)
And sometimes we punch each other in the face
Like when I hit on your mom and got to second base
I'm trying to say I love you in a heterosexual way

You fart and burp in the same key
And I think your iPod sucks
You make fun of my hair because yours is
Disappearing

I've seen your penis you've seen mine
I popped your pimples you rubbed Aloe
Vera on my sunburnt back
You laughed in fits when I shit my pants
You felt my girl's brand new boobs
You asked to suck 'em she refused
So while you slept I shaved your head
You woke up and told me that I...

You'll tell the world I'm gay
When you hear me say
That I really and truly feel this way
Not that there's anything wrong with being gay (ooooo)
And sometimes we punch each other in the face
Like when I hit on your mom and got to second base
I'm trying to say I love you (I freakin' love you dude)
I know you know I love you in a heterosexual way

Na na na na
Na na na na
Na na na na

I'm trying to say I love you in a heterosexual way

Na na na na
Na na na na
Na na na na
Na na naMoving forward using all my breath
Being friends with you was never second best
And I saw the world crashing all around your face
Never really knowing it was always mesh and lace

I'll stop the world and melt with you
You've seen the difference and it's getting better all the time
And there's nothing you and I won't do
I'll stop the world and melt with you

(You should know better) Dream of better lives the kind which never hate
(You should see) Trapped in a state of imaginary grace
(You should know better) I made a pilgrimage to save this human's race
(You should see) Never comprehending a race that's long gone by

(Let's stop the world) I'll stop the world and melt with you
(Let's stop the world) You've seen the difference and it's getting better all the time
And there's nothing you and I won't do
(Let's stop the world) I'll stop the world and melt with you

The future's open wide

I'll stop the world and melt with you
(I'll stop the world) You've seen some changes and it's getting better all the time
And there's nothing you and I won't do
(I'll stop the world) I'll stop the world and melt with you

The future's open wide

I'll stop the world and melt with you (I'll stop the world and melt with you)
I'll stop the world and melt with you (I'll stop the world and melt with you)You're not Pamela Lee
But you look good to me
You're no Olivia Munn
But you're so much fun
You're no Jessica Biel
But you've got sex appeal
You're not Kristen Bell
But you're pretty kick ass as far as I can tell

And you've got great natural boobies

I like you in sweatpants, no makeup
I even like your messed up hair
You're just perfect right when you wake up
You're so pretty when you don't care!
There's just gotta be a heaven above
Cause there's an angel on earth right here
There's nothing you need to fix
I like normal chicks

Not quite Lucy Liu
But you love Mtley Cre
No Jennifer Love Hewitt
But I still think we should do it
You're not Scarlett Johansson
But you're good at romancing
You're no Rachel Kapelski
That's just a girl who went to my high school

And it's okay if you eat a whole pizza

I like you in sweatpants, no makeup
I even like your messed up hair
You're just perfect right when you wake up
You're so pretty when you don't care!
There's just gotta be a heaven above
Cause there's an angel on earth right here
There's nothing you need to fix
I like normal chicks

No Botox, no tanning beds
No hair extensions on your head
You don't need plastic surgery
To impress a normal guy like me

I like you in ripped jeans, a Frank Turner T-shirt
And the flip-flops you got at the gap
When you're dressed down and not dolled up
With a backwards baseball cap!

I like you in sweatpants, no makeup
I even like your messed up hair
You're just perfect right when you wake up
You're so pretty when you don't care!
There's just gotta be a heaven above
Cause there's an angel on earth right here
There's nothing you need to fix
I like normal chicks

There's nothing you need to fix
I like Normal Chicks

Oh-oh!I walked along the avenue
I never thought I'd meet a girl like you;
Meet a girl like you
With auburn hair and tawny eyes;
The kind of eyes that hypnotize me through;
Hypnotize me through
And I ran, I ran so far away
I couldn't get away

A cloud appears above your head;
A beam of light comes shining down on you
Shining down on you
The cloud is moving nearer still
Aurora borealis comes in view;
Aurora comes in view
And I ran, I ran so far away
I just ran, I ran all night and day
I couldn't get away

Reached out a hand to touch your face;
You're slowly disappearing from my view;
Disappearing from my view
Reached out a hand to try again;
I'm floating in a beam of light with you;
A beam of light with you
And I ran, I ran so far away
I just ran, I ran all night and day
I couldn't get awayHello... Hello... Hello... Hello... Hello!

(Two, Three...)
This song goes out to my good friends
Especially the ones I had before
The Grammy Nominations of 2003
And to all the girls from back in high school
Who actually spoke to me even though I was a fat kid
And a marching band geek

[Hook]
I hope this song finds you well
And I hope that you're doing fucking swell
I hope that you're back up
If you've ever been down
And I hope you got the fuck out of our hometown!

[Verse 1]
Here comes a shout-out to the professor
Who said, "Son, pick a path and stay the same
Because charisma is the key to opportunity."
And to all the clubs that let us play
To our family and friends and the music stores
For giving us gear when we couldn't pay

[Hook]
I hope this song finds you well
And I hope that you're doing fucking swell
I hope that you're back up
If you've ever been down
And I hope you got the fuck out of our hometown!

[Bridge]
You know I can't count how many times
I've heard people say
(Heard people say)
Be proud of where you're from
You're gonna put us on the map
But where the Hell were you back in the day?
(Back in the day)
No one came to see us
So we got the hell out of there
So there
You have it

[Verse 2]
(Do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do)
This song goes out to my big brother
For putting up with me following you around
And for making me smile when things at home weren't great
And for not getting pissed when I humped your girlfriend
For letting me take your car to the prom
For beating up the guys that hung my bike in a tree
For hand-me-down albums and guitar with no strings
And for never beating the shit out of me!

[Hook]
I hope this song finds you well
And I hope that you're doing fucking swell
I hope that you're back up
Because I know you've been down
I just wish you'd get the fuck out of our hometown!

[Outro]
I hope you get the fuck out of our hometown!
I'm so glad I got the fuck out of our hometown!
You know what I'm talking about, don't you?
Dammit!From here to the stars
With my candy bars
Rides a kid
With a knack
For inventions

A super-powered mind
A mechanical canine
He rescues the day
From sure destruction

He's gotta save the world
And get to school on time
So many things to do
And not much time

So off the ground
Up in the air
Out into the atmoshpere

Who can we count on?
Jimmy Neutron!
Who can we count on?
Jimmy Neutron!
Who can we count on?
Jimmy Neutron!

No matter where you are
You know he can't be far
Watching the world
Through x-ray vision

And whenever he's around
Where adventure can be found
You know that Jimmy Neutron's
On a mission

He's gotta save the world
And get to school on time
So many things to do
And not much time

So off the ground
Up in the air
Out into the atmoshpere

Who can we count on?
Jimmy Neutron!
Who can we count on?
Jimmy Neutron!
Who can we count on?
Jimmy Neutron!
Who can we count on?
Jimmy Neutron!
Who can we count on?
Jimmy Neutron!
Who can we count on?
It's Jimmy Neutron!Lately I feel so small
Or maybe it's just that my bed has grown
I never noticed it before
But you were there
So how was I to know

That this single bed
Was always meant for two
Not just anyone
It was meant for
Me and you

And now you're half-way round the world
And I'm just a day behind
Nothing seems to fill the hole
That I have since you left my side
You'll always be my little girl
Though I can't hold you tonight
And now your halfway round the world
And I'm just a day behind

I wake up in the night
And I turn around and find that you're not there
I just like to watch you sleep and lay by you
I love to feel you near
I think I'm going crazy
Every day confusion starts to grow
I never noticed it before
But you were there so how was I to know
That this single bed
Was always meant for two
Not just anyone
It was meant for
Me and you

And now you're half-way round the world
And I'm just a day behind
Nothing seems to fill the hole
That I have since you left my side
You'll always be my little girl
Though I can't hold you tonight
And now your halfway round the world
And I'm just a day behind

Lately I feel so small
Or maybe it's just that my bed has grown
I never noticed it before
But you were there
So how was I to know
And now you're half-way round the world
And I'm just a day behind
Nothing seems to fill the hole
That I have since you left my side
You'll always be my little girl
Though I can't hold you tonight
And now your halfway round the world
And I'm just a day behind

Just a day behind
Just a day behind
Just a day behind
Just a day behindDo-do-do-do, do-do-do-do, do-do-do-do-do do do do do
Do-do-do-do, do-do-do-do, do-do-do-do-do do do do do

Such a big man, such a little chick
I think it all goes back to your tiny...
Pick-up truck in the driveway, with a sticker on the window, "Rest in Peace #3"

Tell all your friends how you put her in her place
Seven pounds of make-up just to hide her beat-up face
Such a pretty face...

[Chorus]
It takes a tough man to slap her around
Such a bad guy to keep such a good girl down
She's wearing shades but we all see, behind the tinted glass
And I've got 99 biker friends, that want to kick your ass

(Do-do-do-do, do-do-do-do, do-do-do-do-do do do do do)

You tell her that you're sorry
Blame it on the beer
Your dad was mean to you
Your friends think you're an ass hole
And I do too
Overcompensating, for your small shoes
Taking her away, but you won't say when
Hold her in your arms tell her this won't happen again
When will this end?

[Chorus]
Well, it takes a tough man to slap her around
Such a bad guy to keep such a good girl down
She's wearing shades but we all see, behind the tinted glass
And I've got 99 biker friends, that want to kick your...

I wish Bruce Lee was here right now
(With his fists of fury)
With his trusty nun-
Chuck Norris is still alive
So let's call up Walker, Texas Ranger
All the dudes from Danger Danger
Get me A-Team, 50-Cent with his bling-bling
And a couple of prison guards (Somebody get a rope... Yeah, how bout it, man)

[Chorus]
It takes a tough man to slap her around
Such a bad guy to keep such a good girl down
You're such a tough guy I can't wait to bring you down
She's wearing shades but we all see, behind the tinted glass
And I've got 99 biker friends, that want to kick your ass

(99 biker friends)
I hope that you can run fast
(99 biker friends)
Start running now
(99 biker friends)
We're gonna kick your ass![Intro]
Twenty years that's a lot of beers

[Verse 1]
Started up this band in '94
We toured the world in a Coleman with some wheels
I know I've sang this song before
But was that back when we still had a record deal

[Pre-Chorus]
But our story isn't finished
And the ink still hasn't dried
We've punished all our livers
We've laughed and we've cried
And I think I've still got some room
For some more tattoos

[Chorus]
Singing la, la, la
So many awesome memories
Some of them I can still recall
La, la, la, we're still alive and drinking
Twenty years; that's a lot of beers!

[Verse 2]
We're still the same we've always been
Break up songs with power chords
And a shit load of Miller Lite
After all this time we're still best friends
(We're still best friends)
Gotten into a lot of pants but only two bar fights

[Pre-Chorus]
Green Day's been on broadway
Well Bruce puked on that street
Back when Salm and Blake were funny
And rockstars still ate meat
And I still had a lot of room
For more tattoos

[Chorus]
Singing la, la, la
So many awesome memories
Some of them I can still recall
La, la, la, we're still alive and drinking
Twenty years; that's a lot of beers!
Twenty years; that's a lot of beers!

[Bridge]
We haven't lost any hair
We haven't lost any pounds
We haven't lost any fans
Because we're the best fucking band around
And we all just got our third matching tattoo

[Chorus]
Singing la, la, la
So many awesome memories
Some of them I can still recall
La, la, la, we're still alive and drinking
Twenty years; that's a lot of beers

[Outro]
Twenty years; that's a lot of beers
Twenty years; that's a lot of beersThere's a hundred and four days of summer vacation
'Till school comes along just to end it
So the annual problem for our generation
Is finding a good way to spend it
Like maybe...

Building a rocket, or fighting a mummy
Or climbing up the Eiffel tower
Discovering something that doesn't exist
Or giving a monkey a shower
Surfing tidal waves, creating nano-bots
Or locating Frankenstein's brain
Finding a Dodo bird, painting a continent
Or driving our sister insane

This could possibly be the best day ever
And the forecast says that tomorrow will likely be a million and six times better
So make every minute count jump up, jump in and seize the day
And let's make sure that in every single possible way
Today is Gonna to Be a Great Day!

Crossing the tundra or building a roller coaster
Skiing down a mountain of beans
Devising a system for remembering everything
Or synchronizing submarines, racing chariots
Taming tiger sharks, constructing a portal to mars
Building a time machine, stretching a rubber tree, or wailing away on guitars

This could possibly be the best day ever
And the forecast says that tomorrow will likely be a million and six times better
So make every minute count to one
Jump in and seize the day
And let's make sure that in every single possible way
Today is Gonna to Be a Great Day!

Let's put our heads together and design a master plan
We may miss dinner, but I know mom will understand...
We got our mission and suppliers, purple gumballs and desires
A pocket full of rubber bands, the manual on handstands
A unicycle compass, and a camera that won't focus
And canteen full of soda, grab a beach towel here we go! (this is Ferb-tastic)

This could possibly be the best day ever
And the forecast says that tomorrow will likely be a million and six times better
So make every minute count to one, jump in and seize the day
And let's make sure that in every single possible way
Today is Gonna to Be a Great Day!

(Seriously this is gonna be great day)

This could possibly be the best day ever (Today's Gonna be a Great Day) [2x][Verse 1]
I'm waking up and baking
Watching the parade
Because today's the day I got over you
Taking out the trash
And the pictures that I stashed
Of the two of us in 1992

[Pre-Chorus]
You stole my heart when
Eddie Vedder was king
I gave you a foot massage
I gave you my ring
You left me for a drummer
Because you said I couldn't sing
But that's okay
Because there'll be

[Chorus]
(No more)
Mountain climbing in the rain
(No more)
Long hair cloggin' up the drain
(No more)
Life will never be the same
Life after Lisa's not so bad at all

[Verse 2]
Saw you with the dude
Who gave us our first tattoos
Did he cover up my name?
That was fast!
Can you believe that I'm alive?
Still not working nine-to-five
And my little band is kicking some ass

[Pre-Chorus]
So when you ask me if I hated you now
It's not you it's just all of the times I missed out on
Sleeping with your roommate
Every time you passed out
But that's okay
And now there's

[Chorus]
(No more)
Mountain climbing in the rain
(No more)
Long hair cloggin' up the drain
(No more)
Life will never be the same
Life after Lisa's not so bad at all

[Bridge]
I bet you're saying to yourself
That you'll find somebody else like me
All I've got to say is
There ain't no fucking way
That you're getting me to say
I'm sorry
Not today

[Chorus]
(No more)
Mountain climbing in the rain
(No more)
Long hair cloggin' up the drain
(No more)

[Outro]
Life will never be the same
Cleaning up the house again
(Listening to house of pain)
Having headaches in my brain
(Listening to you complain)
Shopping at the mall again
(I'm outta rhymes I've gotta say)
Life after Lisa's not so bad at all
Not so bad at all

(No more)
(Mountain climbing in the rain)
Not so bad at all
(No more)
(Long hair cloggin' up the drain)
(No more)
Not so bad at all
Life will never be the same
Life after Lisa's not so bad at all
Oh no not so badShe used to kiss me every morning
She used to laugh at my jokes
She used to sit across the table at the Sweetwater Tavern
Drinking rum and cokes

I used to put my hands on her
But not like Prince in Purple Rain
I used to tell her that I really like crazy
She responded by being insane

[Chorus]
I gave her all my time
She used to blow my mind
I used to make her cry
And she used to be mine

She took the pickles off my burger
And fed me fries while I drove
I used to ask her if I could do her front in the shower
She would laugh and say, 'No.'

We used to go to bed early (We used to go to bed at 10)
And do all of the things (Do all of the things)
I used to go with her to yoga
Cause it made her wanna do more things (Like downward dog)

[Chorus]
I gave her all my time
She used to blow my mind
I used to make her cry
And she used to be mine

I can't help but wonder what could've been
(What could've, what, what could've)
I had a dream she came back and we tried it all again
And even in my sleep I still fuck it up
(Fuck, fuck, fuck it, fuck, fuck, fuck it up)
And even in my sleep I still wanna do most of her friends

She used to kiss me every morning
She used to come to my shows
We used to hang out at the Hickory Street tavern
An hour after it closed

[Alternative Chorus]
I should've given more of my time
She still blows my mind
She still makes me cry
And she used to be mine[Verse 1]
I got my first real six string
Bought it at the five and dime
Played it til my fingers bled
Was the summer of '69

[Chorus 1]
Me and some guys from school
Had a band and we tried real hard
Jimmy quit and Jody got married
I shoulda known we'd never get far
But when I look back now
That summer seemed to last forever
And if I had the choice
Ya - I'd always wanna be there
Those were the best days of my life

[Verse 2]
There ain't no use in complainin'
When you got a job to do
Spent my evenin's down at the drive-in
And that's when I met you - ya

[Chorus 2]
Standin' on your mama's porch
You told me that you'd wait forever
Oh and when you held my hand
I knew that it was now or never
Those were the best days of my life
Oh yeah Back in the summer of '69

[Bridge]
Man we were killin' time
We were young and restless
We needed to unwind
I guess nothin' can last forever - forever, no...

[Verse 3]
And now the times are changin'
Look at everything that's come and gone
Sometimes when I play that old six string
I think about ya'n wonder what went wrong

[Chorus 3]
Standin' on your mama's porch
You told me it would last forever
Oh the way you held my hand
I knew that it was now or never
Those were the best days of my life

[Outro]
Back in the summer of '69I always thought my movie
Would be a comedy
Not quite the tragedy that its become
More slapstick than chickflick
More Caddyshack than Breakfast At Tiffany's
So, thank me at the podium
For a lifetime of contribution
Turn on the cameras
Someone cue the extras
Hair and makeup to the set

Because the big screen's calling
Final casting call
Its your big shot baby your the next big star
Of another stupid movie
'bout a guy with a broken heart
Is falling apart
Your headed for the cutting room floor
And in the sequel honey
I'm the guy who gets the girl

So if you miss my movie
Get the DVD
Check out the chemistry
Between you and me
Less 'Raising Arizona'
More 'Steel Magnolias'
So when you walk down that red carpet
I hope you trip and fall
I hope someone squirts you with a watergun
A super soaker filled with pee

Because the big screen's calling
Final casting call
Its your big shot baby your the next big star
Of another stupid movie
About a guy with a broken heart
Is falling apart
Your headed for the cutting room floor
And in the sequel honey
I'm the guy who gets the girl

All apologies
To Kevin Costner
And that chick from monster
Give me Adam Sandler
Will Ferrell, Belushi and even Val Kilmer
He was funny in 'Real Genius'
"What about 'Top Gun'?"
"No, 'Top Gun' wasn't funny"
"Whatever"

Top secret was funny too
But he sucked as Batman

Because the big screen's calling
Final casting call
Its your big shot baby your the next big star
Of another dumb movie
About a guy with a broken heart
I'm falling apart

Steven Spielberg's calling and he's sending a car
It's your big shot baby, you're the next big star
Of another stupid movie
About a guy with a broken heart
Who's falling apart
Your headed for the cutting room floor
But in the sequel honey
I'm the guy who gets the girl

I'm the guy that gets the girl
That gets the girl
I'm the guy that gets the girl

[BACKGROUND (repeat until fade out):]
Adam Sandler, Will Ferrell, Belushi and Akroid, Chris Farley, Bill Murray in 'Stripes'
Eddie Murphy till 90, Chris Rock and John Candy, the cast of Hollywood Knights
Mike Myers, Jim Carrey and the Farelly Brothers are more my style
'Terms of Endearment' I didn't get it
I'd much rather shut up and smile[Verse 1]
I wanna wake up in your arms
I wanna set off your alarm
I wanna break into your car
And I wanna take out the back seat
The one where you told me everything
I thought I'd always wanted to hear
The one where you told me that it's over

[Pre-Chorus]
And everytime you look in your rear view mirror
I hope you see me
And all the stuff we did when we were back there together, uh huh

[Chorus]
I hope you like your two-seater, no radio
Keymarks parallel to the pinstripes
Windows broken, your t-top's stolen
Now it's one of a kind, thanks for the ride

[Verse 2]
I gotta get the hell out of dodge
I just spent the whole night avoiding the cops
And I just don't think I'll go to the clink
Just cause I took out the back seat
Remember you told me everything
I thought I always wanted to hear
And that's where you told me that it's over

[Pre-Chorus]
And everytime you look in your rear view mirror
I hope you see me
And all the stuff we did when we were back there together, uh huh

[Chorus]
I hope you like your two-seater, no radio
Keymarks parallel to the pinstripes
Windows broken, your t-top's stolen
Now it's one of a kind, thanks for the ride

[Bridge]
Can you hear your radio?
I bet you can't hear your radio
So you'll never know I wrote this song (for you)
Sorry that your tires are flat
No, you really weren't expecting that
Guess I got a little carried away
So when you look in your rear view mirror
I hope you see me there

[Chorus]
I hope you like your two-seater, no radio
Keymarks parallel to the pinstripes
Windows broken, your t-top's stolen
Now it's one of a kind, thanks for the ride

[Outro]
(No radio)
Two-seater
(No radio)
Thanks for the ride
Two-seater, thanks for the ride
Two-seater, thanks for the ride[Intro]

Here comes the big beat, big beat to blast ya'

[Verse 2]
Break it up, break it down
See me comin' you can hear my sound
Tell somebody in your town
Spread the word, spread the word

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Go call the police, go call the governor
I bring the treble, don't mean to trouble ya'
I make it bubble up, call me the bubbler
I am the bad bitch, the bitch that you're lovin' up

[Bridge]
Hold your head high, fingers to the sky
They gon' try and try ya', but they can't deny ya'
Keep it moving higher, and higher
Keep it moving higher, and higher
So hold your head high, fingers to the sky
Now they don't believe ya', but they gonna need ya'
Keep it moving higher and higher
Keep it moving higher and higher and higher

Work it out, work it out
You better work bitch

Baby, can't you see I'm calling?
A guy like you should wear a warning
It's dangerous, I'm falling
There's no escape, I can't wait
I need a hit, baby, give me it
You're dangerous, I'm lovin' it

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Too high, can't come down
Losing my head, spinnin' 'round and 'round
Do you feel me now?

[Chorus]
With a taste of your lips, I'm on a ride
You're toxic, I'm slippin' under
With a taste of a poison paradise
I'm addicted to you
Don't you know that you're toxic?
And I love what you do
Don't you know that you're toxic?

[Verse 2]
It's getting late to give you up
I took a sip from my devil's cup
Slowly, it's taking over me

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Too high, can't come down
It's in the air and it's all around
Can you feel me now?

[Chorus]
With a taste of your lips, I'm on a ride
You're toxic, I'm slippin' under
With a taste of a poison paradise
I'm addicted to you
Don't you know that you're toxic?
And I love what you do
Don't you know that you're toxic?
Don't you know that you're toxic?

[Chorus]
With a taste of your lips, I'm on a ride
You're toxic, I'm slippin' under
With a taste of a poison paradise
I'm addicted to you
Don't you know that you're toxic?
With a taste of your lips, I'm on a ride
You're toxic, I'm slippin' under (Toxic)
With a taste of a poison paradise
I'm addicted to you
Don't you know that you're toxic?

[Outro]
Intoxicate me now with your lovin' now
I think I'm ready now (I think I'm ready now)
Intoxicate me now with your lovin' now
I think I'm ready now[Intro]
Oh baby, baby
Oh baby, baby

[Verse 1]
Oh baby, baby, how was I supposed to know
That something wasn't right here?
Oh baby, baby, I shouldn't have let you go
And now you're out of sight, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
Show me how you want it to be
Tell me, baby, 'cause I need to know now, oh, because

[Chorus]
My loneliness is killing me (And I)
I must confess I still believe (Still believe)
When I'm not with you, I lose my mind
Give me a sign

Boy, you got me blinded
Oh pretty baby, there's nothing that I wouldn't do
It's not the way I planned it

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse 1]
I think I did it again
I made you believe we're more than just friends, oh, baby
It might seem like a crush
But it doesn't mean that I'm serious

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause to lose all my senses
That is just so typically me, ooh, baby, baby

[Chorus]
Oops!... I did it again
I played with your heart
Got lost in the game
Oh, baby, baby
Oops, you think I'm in love
That I'm sent from above
I'm not that innocent

[Verse 2]
You see, my problem is this, I'm dreaming away
Wishing that heroes, they truly exist
I cry watching the days
Can't you see I'm a fool in so many ways?

[Pre-Chorus]
But to lose all my senses
That is just so typically me, oh, baby, oh

[Chorus]
Oops!... I did it again
I played with your heart
Got lost in the game
Oh, baby, baby
Oops, you think I'm in love
That I'm sent from above

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Interlude]
"All aboard!"
"Britney, before you go, there's something I want you to have"
"Oh, it's beautiful! But wait a minute, isn't this?"
"Yeah, yes, it is."
"But I thought the old lady dropped it into the ocean in the end"
"Well, baby, I went down and got it for ya"
"Aw, you shouldn't have"

[Bridge]
Oops!... I did it again to your heart
Got lost in this game, oh, baby
Oops, you (oops, you) think that I'm sent from above
I'm not that innocent

[Chorus]
Oops!... I did it again
I played with your heart
Got lost in the game
Oh, baby, baby
Oops, you think I'm in love
That I'm sent from above
I'm not that innocent
Oops!... I did it again
I played with your heart
Got lost in the game
Oh, baby, baby
Oops, you think I'm in love
That I'm sent from above
I'm not that innocent[Verse 1: Britney Spears]
Friday
I'm dreaming a mile a minute 'bout somebody
This feeling, I wanna go with it, 'cause there's no way
We're hiding away from this tonight, oh, this tonight
Can tell you want me
By the way I see you starin' 'cross the room, babe
No shame in the game, just cut the shit, be honest
Yeah, you know what you gotta do tonight, do tonight

[Pre-Chorus 1: Britney Spears]
I just want you to make me move
Like it ain't a choice for you, like you've got a job to do
Just want you to raise my roof
Something sensational (Sensational, oh, yeah)

[Chorus: Britney Spears]
And make me oooh, oooh, oooh, oooh
And make me oooh, oooh, oooh, oooh

[Verse 2: Britney Spears]
No rules
From the bar to the car, let's take it back to my room
Ignite in the heat of the moment, let the sparks fuse
Blowing up to the ceiling, we burning bright when we cut the light
'Cause you're the flame I can't do without
The fire comes in, the sky falls down
There's no way I'm gonna be fighting this tonight, this tonight

[Pre-Chorus 1: Britney Spears]
I just want you to make me move
Like it ain't a choice for you, like you've got a job to do
Just want you to raise my roof
Something sensational (Sensational, oh, yeah)

[Chorus: Britney Spears]
And make me oooh, oooh, oooh, oooh
And make me oooh, oooh, oooh, oooh

[Post-Chorus: Britney Spears & G-Eazy]
Baby, 'cause you're the spark that won't go out
My heart's on fire when you're around
Make me oooh, oooh, oooh, oooh
Yeah, yeah, Eazy

[Verse 3: G-Eazy]
I don't care if it's a random person or the biggest star
Out in Vegas or a little bar
Its really not a difference if it's near or far
Listen, here we are, need you
I've always wanted what was off limits
Staring at you 'til I'm caught in this
Back and forth like this is all tennis
I'm all jealous, you came with someone
But we can tell that there are changes coming
See, I can tell that you're a dangerous woman
That means you're speaking my language, come on

Oh, baby baby, have you seen Amy tonight?
Is she in the bathroom, is she smoking up outside? (Oh!)
Oh, baby baby, does she take a piece of lime for the drink that I'mma buy her?
Do you know just what she likes? (Oh!)

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh-oh

La, la, la, la, la-la, la, la

[Verse 2]
Amy told me that she's gonna meet me up
I don't know where or when, and now they're closing up the club (Oh!)
I've seen her once or twice before, she knows my face
But it's hard to see with all the people standing in the way (Oh!)

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh-oh
Tell me, have you seen her? 'Cause I'm so, oh
I can't get her off of my brain
I just wanna go to the party she gon' go

'Cause I've been waiting here forever

Oh, but can't you see what I see?
(Love me, hate me) Oh, say what you want about me
All of the boys and all of the girls
Are begging to if you seek Amy[Verse 1]
Notice me
Take my hand
Why are we
Strangers when
Our love is strong?
Why carry on without me?

[Chorus]
And every time I try to fly, I fall
Without my wings, I feel so small
I guess I need you, baby
And every time I see you in my dreams
I see your face, it's haunting me
I guess I need you, baby

[Verse 2]
I make believe
That you are here
It's the only way
I see clear
What have I done?
You seem to move uneasy

[Chorus]
And every time I try to fly, I fall
Without my wings, I feel so small
I guess I need you, baby
And every time I see you in my dreams
I see your face, you're haunting me
I guess I need you, baby

[Bridge]
I may have made it rain
Please, forgive me
My weakness caused you pain
And this song's my sorry
At night, I pray
That soon your face will fade away

[Chorus]
And every time I try to fly, I fall
Without my wings, I feel so small
I guess I need you, baby
And every time I see you in my dreams
I see your face, you're haunting me
I guess I need you, baby[Verse 1]
Superstar, where you from? How's it going?
I know you got a clue what you're doing
You can play brand new to all the other chicks out here
But I know what you are
What you are, baby
Look at you, getting more than just a re-up
Baby, you got all the puppets with their strings up
Faking like a good one, but I call 'em like I see 'em
I know what you are
What you are, baby

[Chorus]
Womanizer
Woman-womanizer, you're a womanizer
Oh, womanizer, oh
You're a womanizer, baby
You-you-you are
You-you-you are
Womanizer, womanizer, womanizer (Womanizer)

[Post-Chorus]
Boy, don't try to front, I-I know just, just what you are
Boy, don't try to front, I-I know just, just what you are
You got me going, you're oh-so-charming
But I can't do it, you womanizer
Boy, don't try to front, I-I know just, just what you are
Boy, don't try to front, I-I know just, just what you are
You say I'm crazy, I got you crazy
You're nothing but a womanizer

[Verse 2]
Daddy-O, you got the swagger of a champion
Too bad for you, you just can't find the right companion
I guess when you have one too many, makes it hard, it could be easy
Who you are, that's just who you are, baby
Lollipop, must mistake me, you're the sucker
To think that I would be a victim, not another
Say it, play it how you wanna, but no way, I'm never gonna fall for you
Never you, baby

[Chorus]
Womanizer
Woman-womanizer, you're a womanizer
Oh, womanizer, oh
You're a womanizer, baby
You-you-you are
You-you-you are
Womanizer, womanizer, womanizer (Womanizer)

[Post-Chorus]
Boy, don't try to front, I-I know just, just what you are
Boy, don't try to front, I-I know just, just what you are
You got me going, you're oh-so-charming
But I can't do it, you womanizer
Boy, don't try to front, I-I know just, just what you are
Boy, don't try to front, I-I know just, just what you are
You say I'm crazy, I got you crazy
You're nothing but a womanizer

[Bridge]
Maybe if we both lived in a different world
(Womanizer, womanizer, womanizer, womanizer)
It would be all good, and maybe I could be your girl
But I can't 'cause we don't, you...

[Chorus]
Womanizer
Woman-womanizer, you're a womanizer
Oh, womanizer, oh
You're a womanizer, baby
You-you-you are
You-you-you are
Womanizer, womanizer, womanizer (Womanizer)

I think I see confetti from this potion
Pillow fights and feathers, overdosin'
Smells like a cologne and candy lotion
Like a slumber party
Sheets all on the floor just like an ocean
Building up your fortress like a mountain
Neighbors say we're causing a commotion
Like a slumber party

No one but, no one but you and I, I, I
We ain't gonna sleep tonigh-igh-ight
Oh baby, no one but, no one but you and I, I, I

Put on our music that makes us go fuckin' crazy, go
Go crazy, go

Let's fill up this clawfoot bath with bubbles
Loving me so hard it's causing trouble
If there's seven minutes in heaven make it double, triple

He is a hustler, he's no good at all
He is a loser, he's a bum, bum, bum, bum
He lies, he bluffs, he's unreliable
He is a sucker with a gun, gun, gun, gun
I know you told me I should stay away
I know you said he's just a dog astray
He's a bad boy with a tainted heart
And even I know this ain't smart

[Chorus]
But mama, I'm in love with a criminal
And this type of love isn't rational, it's physical
Mama, please don't cry, I will be alright
All reason aside, I just can't deny, love the guy

[Verse 2]
He is a villain by the devil's law
He is a killer just for fun, fun, fun, fun
The man's a snitch and unpredictable
He's got no conscience, he got none, none, none, none
Oh, I know, should've let go, but no
'Cause he's a bad boy with a tainted heart
And even I know this ain't smart

[Chorus]
But mama, I'm in love with a criminal
And this type of love isn't rational, it's physical
Mama, please don't cry, I will be alright
All reason aside, I just can't deny, love the guy

[Bridge]
And he's got my name
Tattooed on his arm, his lucky charm
So I guess it's okay, he's with me
And I hear people talk (People talk)
Try to make remarks, keep us apart
But I don't even hear, I don't care

[Chorus]
'Cause mama, I'm in love with a criminal
And this type of love isn't rational, it's physical
Mama, please don't cry, I will be alright
All reason aside, I just can't deny, love the guy

(Oh, I know, oh) Mama I'm in love with a criminal
(Should've let go) And this type of love isn't rational
(But no) It's physical
(Oh, I know, oh) Mama, please don't cry, I will be alright
(Should've let go) All reason aside
(But no) I just can't deny, love the guy[Produced by The Invisible Men]

[Chorus: Britney Spears & (Iggy Azalea)]
All around the world, pretty girls
Wipe the floor with all the boys
Pour the drinks, bring the noise (It's Iggy-Iggs!)
We're just so pretty!
All around the world, pretty girls
Jump the line, to the front
Do what we like, get what we want (Where you at, Brit?)
We're just so pretty!

[Verse 1: Britney Spears]
Hey, don't you know that it's always the same?
From Australia 'round to LA
You can betcha', wherever the girls go, boys follow
We be keeping them up on their toes
They can laugh, but they don't get the jokes
Set your watch, they're so predictable
(Some things don't change...)

[Pre-Chorus: (Britney Spears) & Iggy Azalea]
(The girls roll up) Windows roll down
(Eyes on us) Jaws on the ground
(Watch them go) It's just so funny

All around the world, pretty girls
Wipe the floor with all the boys
Pour the drinks, bring the noise

We're just so pretty!

[Verse 2: Britney Spears]
Tell me, is it true that these men are from Mars?
Is that why they be acting bizarre?
Every time I walk out of my house it's like, "Hey, baby!"
They don't see me rolling my eyes
They buzzing around me like flies
They got one thing on their minds
(Some things don't change...)

[Verse 3: Iggy Azalea]
Damn, still killing them softly
I would spend time with you but that'd cost me
They pray that Iggy-Iggy give 'em one more chance
But busy Iggy wouldn't even give 'em one more glance
See, it's a thin line between the beauty and the beast
Slim waist, thick cake, the whole world want a piece
Bad girl, good (Ooh) would make you lose your mind
All of the boys begging Britney, hit 'em one more time
Iggs
What's up, Britney?

[Chorus: Britney Spears & Iggy Azalea]
All around the world, pretty girls

Feels like no one else in the room (But you)

We can get down like there's no one around

This is a story about a girl named Lucky

[Verse 1]
Early morning, she wakes up
Knock, knock, knock on the door
It's time for makeup, perfect smile
It's you they're all waiting for

[Pre-Chorus]
They go, "Isn't she lovely, this Hollywood girl?"
And they say

[Chorus]
"She's so lucky, she's a star
But she cry, cry, cries in her lonely heart, thinking
If there's nothing missing in my life
Then why do these tears come at night?"

[Verse 2]
Lost in an image, in a dream
But there's no one there to wake her up
And the world is spinning, and she keeps on winning
But tell me, what happens when it stops?

[Pre-Chorus]
They go, "Isn't she lovely, this Hollywood girl?"
And they say

[Chorus]
"She's so lucky, she's a star
But she cry, cry, cries in her lonely heart, thinking
If there's nothing missing in my life
Then why do these tears come at night?"

[Interlude]
"Best actress, and the winner is, Lucky!"
"I'm Roger Johnson for Pop News, standing outside the arena waiting for Lucky"
"Oh my God, here she comes!"

[Bridge]
Isn't she lovely, this Hollywood girl?
She is so lucky, but why does she cry?
If there is nothing missing in her life
Why do tears come at night?
And they say

[Chorus]
"She's so lucky, she's a star
But she cry, cry, cries in her lonely heart, thinking
If there's nothing missing in my life
Then why do these tears come at night?"
She's so lucky, she's a star
But she cry, cry, cries in her lonely heart, thinking
If there's nothing missing in my life
Then why do these tears come at night?[Verse 1]
There's only two types of people in the world
The ones that entertain and the ones that observe
Well, baby, I'm a put-on-a-show kinda girl
Don't like the backseat, gotta be first, oh-oh
I'm like the ringleader, I call the shots (I call the shots)
I'm like a firecracker, I make it hot when I put on a show

[Pre-Chorus]
I feel the adrenaline moving through my veins
Spotlight on me, and I'm ready to break
I'm like a performer, the dance floor is my stage
Better be ready, hope that you feel the same

[Chorus]
All the eyes on me
In the center of the ring, just like a circus
When I crack that whip
Everybody gonna trip, just like a circus
Don't stand there watching me, follow me
Show me what you can do
Everybody let go
We can make a dance floor, just like a circus

[Verse 2]
There's only two types of guys out there
Ones that can hang with me and ones that are scared
So, baby, I hope that you came prepared
I run a tight ship, so beware
I'm like a ringleader, I call the shots (I call the shots)
I'm like a firecracker, I make it hot when I put on a show

[Pre-Chorus]
I feel the adrenaline moving through my veins
Spotlight on me, and I'm ready to break
I'm like a performer, the dance floor is my stage
Better be ready, hope that you feel the same

[Chorus]
All the eyes on me
In the center of the ring, just like a circus
When I crack that whip
Everybody gonna trip, just like a circus
Don't stand there watching me, follow me
Show me what you can do
Everybody let go
We can make a dance floor, just like a circus

[Breakdown]
Let's go
Let me see what you can do

I'm running this (Like a circus)

Yeah, like a what? (Like a circus)

All the eyes on me
In the center of the ring, just like a circus
When I crack that whip
Everybody gonna trip, just like a circus
Don't stand there watching me, follow me
Show me what you can do
Everybody let go
We can make a dance floor, just like a circus
All the eyes on me
In the center of the ring, just like a circus
When I crack that whip
Everybody gonna trip, just like a circus
Don't stand there watching me, follow me
Show me what you can do
Everybody let go
We can make a dance floor, just like a circus[Refrain]

Sit you down, hop onto your pot of gold
You make me come alive

Swing it to the left, swing it to the right
Struttin' on the stage, centre of the lights
Trippin' smiles ain't coming down
Take your seat now

[Chorus]
Put on a private show
Pull the curtains until they close

Work it, work it, boy, watch me work it
Slide down my pole, watch me spin it and twerk it
Work it, work it, boy, watch me work it
Slide down my pole, watch me spin it and twerk it
Put on a private show
Pull the curtains until they close
I'll put on a private show

All my feelings are, about to erupt
All my tricks, they're spectacular
My encore is immaculate

Swing it to the left, swing it to the right
Struttin' on the stage, centre of the lights
Trippin' smiles ain't coming down
Take your seat now

Credits are closing now
Guess that's the end
Can we go again?
Can we do it all again?
Nah, I'll take a bow
Up, down, run it round
Tasting on my apple pie
Apple pie, satisfy[Intro]
Dark mascara dripping down my face
Only fools could ever feel this way
Send my message into outer space
Wonder if it's gonna float your way

[Verse 1]
I can't compete with the stars in the sky
I'm invisible, invisible
I open the window to clear out my mind
But it's difficult, so difficult

[Pre-Chorus]
Houston, I know there's a problem here
Must be a hole in the atmosphere
Baby, I wanna be closer to love

[Chorus]
Patience, darling, wait for the night
Darkness comes and love comes alive
I've been right here dreaming of you
Waiting for my man on the moon
Moon

[Verse 2]
Last night I was in your arms so strong (It felt so good)
One small step and, baby, you were gone
Now there's meaning in the saddest songs (I just wanna cry)
All I do is cry and sing along (And cry, and cry...)

[Pre-Chorus]
Drinking alone in my party dress
Would you come back if I looked my best?
Put on a smile and I say to myself (I said it again)

[Chorus]
Patience, darling, wait for the night
Darkness comes and love comes alive
I've been right here dreaming of you
Waiting for my man on the moon
Moon
Moon
Moon

[Bridge]
I can't compete with the stars in the sky
I'm invisible, invisible
I open the window to clear up my mind
But it's difficult (why is it so difficult?), so difficult
Chteau Marouatte
Il m'amne au lieu du chevalier cet hivers
Cinq, quatre, trois, deux, un

Patience, darling, wait for the night
Darkness comes and love comes alive
I've been right here dreaming of you
Waiting for my man on the moon

Do I imagine it, or do I see your stare?
Is there still longing there?
Oh, I hate myself and I feel crazy
Such a classic tale
Current girlfriend, ex girlfriend
I'm trying to be cool
I'm being paranoid, am I seeing things?
Am I just insecure?

[Pre-Chorus]
I want to believe
It's just you and me
Sometimes it feels like there's three
Of us in here, baby

[Chorus]
So, I wait for you to call
And I try to act natural
Have you been thinking 'bout her or about me?
And while I wait, I put on my perfume
Yeah, I want it all over you
I gotta mark my territory

[Post-Chorus]
I'll never tell, tell on myself
But I hope she smells my perfume
I'll never tell, tell on myself
But I hope she smells my perfume
I'll hide it well, hope you can't tell
But I hope she smells my perfume
I'll hide it well, hope you can't tell
But I hope she smells my perfume

[Verse 2]
I wanna fill the room, when she's in it with you
Please, don't forget me
Do I imagine it, or catch these moments?
I know you got history
But I'm your girlfriend, now, I'm your girlfriend trying to be cool
I hope I'm paranoid, that I'm just seeing things
That I'm just insecure

[Pre-Chorus]
I want to believe
It's just you and me
Sometimes it feels like there's three
Of us in here, baby

[Chorus]
So, I wait for you to call
And I try to act natural

Tall tales, such a damn shame
Hindsight, I can see it all so plain

Fire come down, fire-fire come down
Left, right, nowhere to turn
Collecting the ash from the bridges you burned
Kamikaze fire come down
Fire come down, fire-fire come down

People can take everything away from you
But they can never take away your truth
But the question is
Can you handle mine?

[Verse 1]
They say I'm crazy
I really don't care
That's my prerogative
They say I'm nasty
But I don't give a damn
Getting boys is how I live
Some ask me questions
Why am I so real?
But they don't understand me
I really don't know the deal about my sister
Trying hard to make it right
Not long ago
Before I won this fight

[Chorus]
Everybody's talking all this stuff about me
Why don't they just let me live? (Tell me why)
I don't need permission, make my own decisions
That's my prerogative
That's my prerogative
(It's my prerogative)
It's the way that I wanna live
(It's my prerogative)
You cant tell me what to do

[Verse 2]
Don't get me wrong
I'm really not souped
Ego trips is not my thing
All these strange relationships really gets me down
I see nothing wrong in spreading myself around

[Chorus]
Everybody's talking all this stuff about me
Why don't they just let me live? (Tell me why)
I don't need permission, make my own decisions
That's my prerogative
That's my prerogative
Everybody's talking all this stuff about me
Why don't they just let me live? (Tell me why)
I don't need permission, make my own decisions
That's my prerogative
That's my prerogative
It's the way that I wanna live
(It's my prerogative)
You cant tell me what to do

[Bridge]
Why can't I live my life
Without all of the things
That people say?

[Chorus]
Everybody's talking all this stuff about me
Why don't they just let me live? (Tell me why)
I don't need permission, make my own decisions
That's my prerogative
They say I'm crazy
Everybody's talking all this stuff about me
Why don't they just let me live? (Tell me why)
(They say I'm nasty)
I don't need permission, make my own decisions
That's my prerogative
(It's my prerogative)[Intro]
Just luv me (Just luv me)

[Verse 1]
I'm not gonna ask for a sip when I'm thirsty
And you don't have to hold my hand when I'm hurting
Won't make you sober me up when I'm turning
And you don't gotta say it, I know that I'm worthy

[Pre-Chorus]
You could ask me for a sorry
And a calm before the storm
Ask for pieces of my body

[Verse 2]
If you think that I'm saying it because I'm high maintenance
Like I'm trying to mask every problem that I'm facing
Well you're wrong cause I don't need nobody when I'm breaking
All I need is your luv and a little bit of patience

[Pre-Chorus]
You could ask me for a sorry
And a calm before the storm
Ask for pieces of my body
Until all of it was yours

[Chorus]
But I'm not gonna ask you for nothing

You keep proving it, you're proving it (yeah)

[Pre-Chorus 2]

All my people on the floor

You evoke the feeling
This feeling I've been dreaming of
I'm ready to reveal it
Let inhibitions come undone

[Pre-Chorus]
Yes or no, but no maybes
Not gonna beg, so don't make me
Yes or no, but no maybes

[Chorus]
Here's my invitation, baby
Hope it sets us free
To know each other better
Put your love all over me
Here's my invitation, baby
Come feel my energy
Give emotions to each other
Put your love all over me
Put your love all over me
Put your love all over

[Verse 2]
I know it might seem crazy
But I'ma put you in this blindfold
I just need you to trust me
Oh, that you see more with your eyes closed

[Pre-Chorus]
Yes or no, but no maybes
Not gonna beg, so don't make me
Yes or no, but no maybes

[Chorus]
Here's my invitation, baby
Hope it sets us free

Here's my invitation, baby
Come feel my energy
Give emotions to each other
Put your love all over me
Put your love all over me
Put your love all over

[Bridge]
Feel it now
Feeling something, kinda thinking out loud
Feeling something, kinda thinking right now, right now
But we could be right, right now, right now

[Chorus]
Here's my invitation, baby
Hope it sets us free
To know each other better
Put your love all over me
Here's my invitation, baby
Come feel my energy
Give emotions to each other
Put your love all over me
Put your love all over me
Put your love all over[Verse 1]
You tell me you're in love with me
Like you can't take your pretty eyes away from me
It's not that I don't wanna stay
But every time you come too close, I move away

[Pre-Chorus]
I wanna believe in everything that you say
'Cause it sounds so good
But if you really want me, move slow
There's things about me you just have to know

[Chorus]
Sometimes I run, sometimes I hide
Sometimes I'm scared of you
But all I really want is to hold you tight
Treat you right, be with you day and night
Baby, all I need is time

[Verse 2]
I don't wanna be so shy, oh, oh
Every time that I'm alone, I wonder why
Hope that you will wait for me
You'll see that you're the only one for me

[Pre-Chorus]
I wanna believe in everything that you say
'Cause it sounds so good
But if you really want me, move slow
There's things about me you just have to know

[Chorus]
Sometimes I run, sometimes, sometimes I hide
Sometimes I'm scared of you
But all I really want is to hold you tight
Treat you right, be with you day and night
All I really want is to hold you tight
Treat you right, be with you day and night
Baby, all I need is time

[Bridge]
Just hang around and you'll see
There's nowhere I'd rather be
If you love me, trust in me
The way that I trust in you

[Chorus]
Sometimes I run, sometimes, sometimes I hide
Sometimes I'm scared of you, ooh
But all I really want is to hold you tight (Hold you tight)
Treat you right, be with you day and night (Day and night)
Sometimes I run, sometimes, sometimes I hide
Sometimes I'm scared of you, ooh
But all I really want is to hold you tight
I'll treat you right, I'll be with you day and night
All I really want is to hold you tight
Be with you day and night
Sometimes I run, sometimes, sometimes I hide
Sometimes I'm scared of you
But all I really want is to hold you tight
Treat you right, be with you[Verse 1]
This kitten got your tongue tied in knots, I see
Spit it out, 'cause I'm dying for company
I notice that you got it, you notice that I want it
You know that I can take it to the next level, baby
If you want this good -ish
Sicker than the remix
Baby, let me blow your mind tonight

Get you off with the touch, dancing in the dark

Hotter than the A-list
Next one on my hit-list
Baby, let me blow your mind tonight

Hey, over there
Please forgive me if Im coming on too strong
Hate to stare, but youre winning
And theyre playing my favorite song
So come here, a little closer
Wanna whisper in your ear
Make it clear, a little question
Wanna know just how you feel

[Chorus]
If I said my heart was beating loud
If we could escape the crowd somehow
If I said I want your body now, would you hold it against me?
'Cause you feel like paradise, and I need a vacation tonight
So, if I said I want your body now, would you hold it against me?

[Verse 2]
Hey, you might think that Im crazy
But you know Im just your type
I might be a little hazy
But you just cannot deny
Theres a spark in-between us
When were dancing on the floor
I want more, wanna see it
So, Im asking you tonight

[Chorus]
If I said my heart was beating loud
If we could escape the crowd somehow
If I said I want your body now, would you hold it against me?
'Cause you feel like paradise, and I need a vacation tonight
So, if I said I want your body now, would you hold it against me?

[Spoken Interlude]
If I said I want your body, would you hold it against me?

And show me how you work it out
Alright

It's been a while
I know I shouldn't've kept you waiting
But I'm here now

[Verse 1]
I know it's been a while, but I'm glad you came
And I've been thinking 'bout how you say my name
You got my body spinning, like a hurricane
And it feels like you got me going insane
And I can't get enough
So, let me get it up

[Pre-Chorus]
Ooh, looks like we're alone now
You ain't gotta be scared, we're grown now
I'ma hit defrost on ya, let's get it blazing
We can turn the heat up if ya wanna
Turn the lights down low if ya wanna
Just wanna move ya, but you froze up
That's what I'm saying

[Chorus]
Let me break the ice
Allow me to get you right
Once ya warm up to me
Baby, I can make you feel hot, hot, hot, hot

Allow me to get you right
Once ya warm up to me
Baby, I can make you feel hot, hot, hot, hot

[Interlude]
So, are you warming up yet?

[Verse 2]
You got me hypnotized
I never felt this way
You got my heart beating like an 808
Can you rise to the occasion?
I'm patiently waiting, 'cause it's getting late
And I can't get enough, so let me get it up

[Pre-Chorus]
Ooh, looks like we're alone now
You ain't gotta be scared, we're grown now

You don't have to look like a movie star
Ooh, I think you're good just the way you are
Tell me if you could would you up and run away with me?
You don't have to roll like a millionaire
Baby, I would go with you anywhere
We don't need no gold, we'll be shining anyway, we'll see

[Pre-Chorus]
You know can nobody get down like us
We don't stop 'til we get enough
C'mon, turn it up 'til the speakers pop
Break it down, show me what you've got

[Chorus]
Ooh, my my baby, don't be shy
I see that spark flashing in your eye
My heart beats fast 'cause I want it all
So baby, come with me and be my ooh la la
Take my hand, we can go all night
And spin me round just the way I like
It feels so good, I don't wanna stop
So baby, come with me and be my ooh la la

[Verse 2]
You don't have to wear no designer clothes
Just as long as we're dancing on the floor
Fingers in my hair and I'm letting go tonight, so free

[Pre-Chorus]
You know can nobody get down like us
We don't stop 'till we get enough
C'mon, turn it up 'till the speakers pop
Break it down, show me what you've got

[Chorus]
Ooh my my baby, don't be shy
I see that spark flashing in your eye
My heart beats fast 'cause I want it all

I'm blind from the tears that fall like rain
So lost, ever since you went away
Sometimes our lives forever change
My heart's never gonna be the same

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause you came and you gave me a place
Place to lay all my pain
Why'd you take it away?

[Chorus]
You never know what you got 'til it's gone
You never know what you got 'til it's gone
You never, you never, you never, you never
You never know what you got 'til it's
Gone, gone, gone, gone
Gone, gone, gone, gone
'Til it's gone, gone, gone, gone
You never know what you got 'til it's gone

[Verse 2]
I try every night, to turn the page
But daylight can't confine me to a cage
In my mind, the life we had replays
Now everywhere, I turn I see your face

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause you came and you gave me a place
Place to lay all my pain
Why'd you take it away?

[Chorus]
You never know what you got 'til it's gone
You never know what you got 'til it's gone
You never, you never, you never, you never
You never know what you got til it's
Gone, gone, gone, gone
Gone, gone, gone, gone
Til it's gone, gone, gone, gone
You never know what you got 'til it's, 'til it's
Gone, gone, gone, gone
Gone, gone, gone, gone
Til it's gone, gone, gone, gone
You never know what you got 'til it's gone

[Bridge]
All the memories, I'm saving
So your love is never fading
Holding on my heart is breaking
Can't let go

[Chorus]
You never know what you got 'til it's
Gone, gone, gone, gone
Gone, gone, gone, gone
Til it's gone, gone, gone, gone
You never know what you got 'til it's, 'til it's

You never know what you got 'til it's
Got 'til it's, got 'til it's, got 'til it's gone[Verse 1]
Cinematic, take it right back
With a bottle of perfume lotion
Where'd you come from talking like that?
Butterfly from the bottom of the ocean
I can't stop this slow motion trip...
Run away with me, no politics
Such a perfect notion
Your gravity has got me
Bowing in devotion
You and me fit a magic trick...

[Chorus]
If I'm dancing, if I'm dancing, if I'm dancing
I know the music's good
If we're dancing, if we're dancing, if we're dancing
I know that we'll be good

[Verse 2]
One look at him and I see
Candy-coated heart shapes
The jewels and furniture can go
But baby, he stays
He plays sitar, three notes so far

[Chorus]
If I'm dancing, if I'm dancing, if I'm dancing
I know the music's good (wait, did you get that?)
If we're dancing, if we're dancing, if we're dancing
I know that we'll be good

[Bridge]
My chakra's all been green and red
But he wants blue and green instead... (let's just do it over)
My chakra's all been green and red
But he wants blue and green instead...

[Chorus]
If I'm dancing, if I'm dancing, if I'm dancing
I know the music's good
If we're dancing, if we're dancing, if we're dancing
I know that we'll be good[Verse 1]
Let's undo all the distance
From your guards down to your buttons
And get lost in your existence
Whatchu, whatchu whatchu wanna do?
And if you wanna get real
And if you wanna get honest
And baby you know the deal
Whatchu wanna do?

[Chorus]
Gotta open up cause it feels much better
When we open up for each other
And I know
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
When you know somebody
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
And they know your body
It's so much better

[Verse 2]
Show me what's under your t-shirt
And bare it like it's your first time
You take it off like you've never
Like you've never been hurt

[Chorus]
Open up (open up) cause it feels much better (much better)
When we open up (open up) for each other (for each other)

When you know somebody, when you know somebody
When you know

[Chorus]
Oh, oh, oh, (oh-oh) oh, oh, oh (oh-oh)
When you know somebody
Oh, oh, oh, (oh-oh) oh, oh, oh (oh-oh)
And they know your body

And they know your body

[Outro]
Oh, get to know my body
Better and better
Better and better
Damn
It's so much better[Verse 1]
Look in the mirror
Who do I see? Who do I wanna be today?
If you came for a show, which role should I take?
Fading to grey, so do we make a big mistake?
True colors'll show, baby, just put me on display

[Pre-Chorus]
Think I've been here before
I've turned some hearts into stone
And I can't hide it no more

[Chorus]
My love is a mood ring
Up and down emotions, all these mood swings
You know how to read the touch of my skin
Nothing on my body but this mood ring
You change me, yeah

[Verse 2]
I have no secrets
'Cause theres a version of me that I dunno how to hide
When you're making me glow with your fingers against my thighs (Glow)

[Pre-Chorus]
Think I've been here before
I've turned some hearts into stone
And I can't hide it no more

[Chorus]
My love is a mood ring
Up and down emotions, all these mood swings
You know how to read the touch of my skin
Nothing on my body but this mood ring
You change me, yeah
(Nothing on my body, but this mood ring, this mood ring)

[Bridge]
I'm in the palm of your hand
My temperature is at your command by my demand
And now I'm falling for you
I turn to golden from blue
And you do too, ah

[Pre-Chorus]
Think I've been here before
I've turned some hearts into stone
And I can't hide it no more

[Chorus]
My love is a mood ring
Up and down emotions, all these mood swings
You know how to read the touch of my skin
Nothing on my body but this mood ring
You change me, yeah[Verse 1]
Got those heels on that you love
The ones that drive you crazy
Exactly what you're dreaming of
I'll give it to you, baby
150 miles away
Singing out my lungs
Driving fast all through L.A
Warming up my tongue

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Heart's beating fast
When I'm turning the key
I see you on your back
And I just can't believe

[Chorus]
She looks just like me, just like me
No, I just can't believe
She looks just like me, just like me
Just like me, ooh

[Verse 2]
Before I think, I start to run
But you can't even face me
Know exactly what you've done
Know exactly, baby

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Pictures, they flash
And I can't even sleep
I see you on your back
And I just can't believe

[Chorus]
She looks just like me, just like me
No, I just can't believe
She looks just like me, just like me
Just like me, ooh

[Bridge]
She can, she can, she can have you
She can, she can, she can have you
She can, she can, she can have you
She can, she can, she can

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Pictures, they flash
And I can't even sleep
I see you on your back
And I just can't believe

[Chorus]
She looks just like me, just like me
No, I just can't believe
She looks just like me, just like me
Just like me, just like me[Verse 1]
There was a time I was one of a kind
Lost in the world, doubting me, myself and I
Was lonely then
Like an alien
I tried, but I never figured it out
Why I always felt like a stranger in a crowd
Oh, that was then
Like an alien

[Chorus]
But the stars in the sky
Look like home, take me home
And the light in your eyes lets me know I'm not alone
Not alone, not alone, not alone
Not alone, not alone, not alone
And we're not alone, not alone, not alone
You're not alone, not alone, not alone

[Verse 2]
Crossed through the universe to get where you are
Travelled the night, riding on a shooting star
Was lonely then
Like an alien
Had to get used to the world I was on
While yet still unsure if I knew where I belonged
Oh, that was then
Like an alien

[Chorus]
But the stars in the sky
Look like home, take me home
And the light in your eyes lets me know I'm not alone
Not alone, not alone, not alone
Not alone, not alone, not alone
And we're not alone, not alone, not alone
You're not alone, not alone, not alone

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
But the stars in the sky
Look like home, take me home
And the light in your eyes lets me know I'm not alone
Not alone, not alone, not alone
Not alone, not alone, not alone
And we're not alone, not alone, not alone
You're not alone, not alone, not alone

[Outro]
(Not alone, not alone, not alone
Not alone, not alone, not alone
Not alone, not alone, not alone
Not alone, not alone, not alone)[Intro: Frank Ocean]
I might
Empty my bank account
And buy that boy with a pipe
Buy that boy with a pipe
I might, I might
Empty my bank account
And buy that boy with a pipe
Buy that boy with a pipe
I might

[Chorus: Frank Ocean]
Do you slide on all your nights like this?
Do you try on all your nights like this? (I might)
Put some spotlight on the slide
Whatever comes, comes through clear
Do you slide on all your nights like this?
Do you try on all your nights like this? (I might)
Put some spotlight on the side
And whatever comes, comes through clear (Uh)

[Verse 1: Frank Ocean]
All this jewelry ain't no use when it's this dark
It's my favorite part, we see the lights, they got so far
It went too fast, we couldn't reach it with our arms
Wrist on a wrist, a link of charms, yeah
Laying, we're still a link apart
It's like we could die here all young
Like we could dye hair all blonde
If we could see in twenty twin
Twice we could see it 'til the end

[Verse 2: Quavo]
Put that spotlight on her face (Spotlight)
Put that spotlight on her face (Ah, yeah)
We gon' pipe up and turn up (Pipe up)
We gon' light up and burn up (Burn up)
Mama too hot like a (Like what?)
Mama too hot like a furnace (Furnace)
I got a hundred G's in my Goyard (G's)
My diamonds gon' shine when the lights dark (Shine)
You and I take a ride down the boulevard (Yeah)
And your friends really wanna break us apart
Good lord

[Verse 3: Offset]
(Offset!) Good gracious
Starin' at my diamonds while I'm hoppin' out a spaceship
Need your information, take vacation to Malaysia (Info)
You my baby, the paparazzi flashin' crazy
She swallowed the bottle while I sit back and smoke gelato
Walk in my mansion, twenty thousand painting, Picasso
Bitches be dippin', dabbin' with niggas like a nacho
Took off her panties, diamonds dancin' like Rick Ricardo
She havin' it, went to college, workin' on her bachelor
I know you got a past, I got a past, that's in the back of us
Average, I'ma make a million on the average (M's)
I'm ridin' with no brain, bitch, I'm out of it (Skrr)

[Chorus: Frank Ocean]
Do you slide on all your nights like this?
Do you try on all your nights like this? (I might)
Put some spotlight on the slide
Whatever comes, comes through clear
Do you slide on all your nights like this? (Yeah)
Do you try on all your nights like this? (Oh)
Put some spotlight on the side
And whatever comes, comes through clear (I might)

[Outro: Frank Ocean]
Empty my bank account (Ooh)

Hey!
Well nothing ever last forever, no
One minute you're here and the next you're gone
So I respect you, wanna take it slow
I need a mental receipt to know this moment I owe

[Pre-Chorus: Pharrell Williams]
Do you mind if I steal a kiss? (Chop, chop)
A little souvenir, can I steal it from you?
To memorize the way you shock me
The way you move it here (Hey)
Just wanna feel it from you (Hey)

[Chorus: Katy Perry]
Don't be afraid to catch feels
Ride drop top and chase thrills (Hey)
I know you ain't afraid to pop pills (Hey)
Baby, I know you ain't scared to catch feels
Feels with me

[Verse 2: Pharrell Williams]
I'm your window shopper, sucker for your love, oh
I'm wearing your goggles, virtual reality
It ain't what it cost you, it might be a dollar
As long as it shocks you, memory, electricity

[Pre-Chorus: Pharrell Williams]
Do you mind if I steal a kiss? (Chop, chop)
A little souvenir, can I steal it from you? (Oh, yeah)

Feels with me (Woah)

[Verse 3: Big Sean]
Goddamn, I know you love to make an entrance
Do you like getting paid or getting paid attention?
You mixed the wrong guys with the right intentions
In the same bed, but it still feel long distance
She's looking for a little more consistency
But when you stop looking you gon' find what's meant to be
And honestly, I'm way too done with the hoes
I cut off all my exes for your x and o's
I feel my old flings was just preparing me
When I say I want you, say it back, parakeet
Fly in first-class through the air, Airbnb
I'm the best you had, you just be comparing me to me
I'ma 'at' this at you, if I put you on my phone
And upload it, it'll get maximum views
I came through in the clutch with the lipsticks and phones
Wear your fave cologne just to get you alone

[Chorus: Katy Perry & Big Sean]
Don't be afraid to catch feels
Don't be afraid to catch these feels
Ride drop top and chase thrills (Yeah)
I know you ain't afraid to pop pills (I know)
Baby, I know you ain't scared to catch feels
Woah, woah, woah
Feels with me
Don't be afraid to catch feels (No, no)
Don't be afraid, baby
Ride drop top and chase thrills (Woah, okay)
I know you ain't afraid to pop pills
I know, I know, I know, I know
Baby, I know you ain't scared to catch feels
Feels with me[Verse 1: Ina Wroldsen]

I've been rollin' on the freeway
I've been riding 85
I've been thinking way too much
And I'm way too gone to drive
I've got anger in my chest
I've got millions on my mind
And you didn't fit the picture
So I guess you weren't the vibe
I've been rollin' on the freeway
I've been riding 85
I've been thinking way too much
And I'm way too gone to drive
I've got anger in my chest
I've got millions on my mind
And you didn't fit the picture
So I guess you weren't the vibe

[Verse 1: Future]
Got L-O-V-E on my right leg, that's Gucci (Get what I'm sayin'?)
Got L-O-V-E on my main ho, that's Pucci (Get what I'm sayin'?)
Caught a lil' jetlag but I'm golden, damn
We deserve Grammys and some Oscars, damn
They deserve Whammy's, they imposters
I be rollin' with my project homies, it's a vibe
I just did some pills with the homie, it's a vibe
Bend her over, switch sides, it's a vibe, yah

[Refrain: Future]
I come through with strippers and some shottas
I gotta accept that I'm a monster
I pull up in several different options
Not all, but most of 'em came topless
I'll shatter your dreams with this cream I make (Cream I make)
Gotta be on codeine to think of shit I say (Shit I say)
I can't feel my toes and ain't gon' fold up (Fold up)
I was in the double R when I rolled up (When I rolled up)

[Chorus: Khalid]
I've been rollin' on the freeway

Pluto
Gotta dig what I'm sayin', Chanel drapes on me, baby
Gotta dig what I'm sayin', she look like she's sponsored by Mercedes
Dig what I'm sayin', this Creed cologne is on me, baby (You dig?)
Dig what I'm sayin'? I'm goin' hard (Hard, yeah)
I pop bubbly in your memory
You should be glad I'm showin' you sympathy (Showin' you sympathy)
I gave you real love out the gutter (Out the gutter)
Ever let you go, you gon' suffer (You gon' suffer from it)

[Refrain: Future]

[Outro: Khalid & Future]
Yeah, L-O-V-E on my right leg
Nah Hendrix overload, dig what I'm sayin'?
I feel like I should be giving up
You can leave if it's too much
But I'm tired of you leading me on, oh no
I don't like where this shit is going
I mean I've been stuck in all your apologies
Gave my all but you want more from me
Keep your love, it doesn't feel the same
I hope it hurts you when you're hearin' my name[Verse 1: Kehlani]
Pray to God, but I'm feeling like he's going deaf
Now when I lean on you and I got nothing left
Hey, I've been wanting to call ya, tell you that I'm sorry
Same old fucking story everybody sing

[Pre-Chorus: Kehlani]
And I say I'm okay, but I guess I'm a liar
You say you're okay, but I saw that you liked it
2 AM and faded, I know that's when you like it
Know that's when you miss me, know that's when you crying

[Chorus: Kehlani]
Why you, why you, why you checking if you're over it?
Why you, why you say "Let go" if you're still holding it?
Just a little bit better at faking it than me, baby
Just a little bit better at faking it than me, baby
Why you, why you, why you checking if you're over it?
Why you, why you say "Let go" if you're still holding it?
Just a little bit better at faking it than me, baby
Just a little bit better at faking it than me, baby

[Verse 2: Kehlani]
Nowadays, I'm just a bitch to everybody else
(Fuck you and you)
I don't need no shoulders, I'm good crying by myself
(Fuck you, too)
Moving on's a chore, 'cause you know I still adore ya
An unrequited love is just a lover's hell

[Pre-Chorus: Kehlani]
And I say I'm okay, but I guess I'm a liar
You say you're okay, but I saw that you liked it
2 AM and faded, I know that's when you like it
Know that's when you miss me, know that's when you crying

[Chorus: Kehlani]
Why you, why you, why you checking if you're over it?
Why you, why you say "Let go" if you're still holding it?
Just a little bit better at faking it than me, baby
Just a little bit better at faking it than me, baby
Why you, why you, why you checking if you're over it?
Why you, why you say "Let go" if you're still holding it?
Just a little bit better at faking it than me, baby
Just a little bit better at faking it than me, baby

[Verse 3: Lil Yachty]
(Lil Boat, Lil Boat, Lil Boat, Lil Boat, Lil Boat)
I'm not gonna act like I don't love ya baby
'Cause deep in my mind, girl, I know I do (true)
Tried to search all through the world and not well
But I can't find a girl who looks close like you (no!)
I done made millions of dollars
But I'm still alone until I come home back to you (yah!)
I remember all of the times we were parked by your house
And laughed all on your avenue
Whoa, you can't front, you're a stone cold diva (yaah!)
I had to get counseling from my moms
She's a heartbreak teacher (oh, yah!)
Remember that time I put those pepperonis on your face
Made you a creature
Now I think about you every single time I eat pizza, ohh

[Chorus: Kehlani]
Why you, why you, why you checking if you're over it?
Why you, why you say "Let go" if you're still holding it?
Just a little bit better at faking it than me, baby
Just a little bit better at faking it than me, baby
Why you, why you, why you checking if you're over it?
Why you, why you say "Let go" if you're still holding it?
Just a little bit better at faking it than me, baby
Just a little bit better at faking it than me, baby

Why you holding me?
Why you holding me?

Yellow diamonds on you like a glass of lemonade

Teeth white, Newports

80 thousand dollar Birkin bag in the Porsche
I'm tryna fuck with you 'til we on life support
I'll split it with you if we get half of Michael Jordan
No toilet tissue, I shit on niggas 'cause life is short (facts)
No passport to go with me, I had to get deported

Hey, hey
I could sweat like this all night
Oh, heatstroke, oh
I think you opened my eyes[Verse 1: Florence Welch]
You took my heart, and you held it in your mouth
And with a word all my love came rushing out
And every whisper, it's the worst
Emptied out by a single word
There is a hollow in me now

[Chorus: Florence Welch]
So I put my faith in something unknown
I'm living on such sweet nothing
But I'm trying to hope with nothing to hold
I'm living on such sweet nothing
And it's hard to learn, and it's hard to love
When you're giving me such sweet nothing
Sweet nothing, sweet nothing
You're giving me such sweet nothing

[Verse 2: Florence Welch]
It isn't easy for me to let it go
'Cause I've swallowed every single word
And every whisper, every sigh
Eats away at this heart of mine
And there is a hollow in me now

[Chorus: Florence Welch]
So I put my faith in something unknown
I'm living on such sweet nothing
But I'm trying to hope with nothing to hold
I'm living on such sweet nothing
And it's hard to learn, and it's hard to love
When you're giving me such sweet nothing
Sweet nothing, sweet nothing
You're giving me such sweet nothing

[Bridge: Florence Welch]
And it's not enough to tell me that you care
When we both know the words are empty air
You give me nothing
Nothing

[Outro: Florence Welch]
Sweet nothing
Sweet nothing[Chorus: Ellie Goulding]
I need your love, I need your time
When everything's wrong, you make it right
I feel so high, I come alive
I need to be free with you tonight
I need your love

[Drop]
I need your love

[Verse 1: Ellie Goulding]
I take a deep breath every time I pass your door
I know you're there but I can't see you anymore
And that's the reason you're in the dark
I've been a stranger ever since we fell apart
And I feel so helpless here
Watch my eyes are filled with fear
Tell me, do you feel the same?
Hold me in your arms again

[Chorus: Ellie Goulding]
I need your love, I need your time
When everything's wrong, you make it right
I feel so high, I come alive
I need to be free with you tonight
I need your love

[Drop]
I need your love

[Verse 2]
Now I'm dreaming, will ever find you now?
I walk in circles but I'll never figure out
What I mean to you, do I belong?
I try to fight this, but I know I'm not that strong
And I feel so helpless here
Watch my eyes are filled with fear
Tell me, do you feel the same?
Hold me in your arms again

[Chorus: Ellie Goulding]
I need your love, I need your time
When everything's wrong, you make it right
I feel so high, I come alive
I need to be free with you tonight
I need your love

[Drop]
I need your love

[Bridge]
All the years, all the times
You were never been to blame
And now my eyes are open
And now my heart is closing
And all the tears, all the lies, all the waste
I've been trying to make it change
And now my eyes are open

[Outro]
I need your love, I need your time
When everything's wrong, you make it right
I feel so high, I come alive
I need to be free[Verse 1: Jessie Reyez]
I don't like to talk, but I love to sing
And I don't smoke, but I love to drink
I'm paranoid, I don't miss a thing
But I'm still nice, at least that's what I think
Fall in love, like I'm a freak
But then I pull out, and say
"I need freedom, I need freedom" (woah-woah)

[Pre-Chorus: Jessie Reyez]
I guess I'll take it, heartbreaker
A title, I can't shake it, can't fake it
I guess I'll take it, heartbreaker
A title, I can't shake it, can't fake it

[Chorus: Jessie Reyez]
Baby, I'd rather be hard to love
Than easy to leave, you should believe me
I'll make you need me
I'd rather be hard to love
Than easy to leave, you should believe me
I'll make you need me

[Verse 2: Jessie Reyez]
'Course you love me, you don't know me
But I got news for you, I came broken
Ego issues, my head is swollen
I got a million chips on my shoulder
But if you stick despite all I showed ya
Maybe you don't need freedom, freedom

[Pre-Chorus: Jessie Reyez]
I guess I'll take it, heartbreaker
A title, I can't shake it, can't fake it
I guess I'll take it, heartbreaker
A title, I can't shake it, can't fake it (yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah)

[Chorus: Jessie Reyez]
Baby, I'd rather be hard to love
Than easy to leave, you should believe me
I'll make you need me
I'd rather be hard to love
Than easy to leave, you should believe me
I'll make you need me

[Bridge: Jessie Reyez]
Go deeper, go deep
I love it when your roots go deep so I know you won't leave
Go deeper, go deep
I love it when your roots go deep so I know you won't leave
Go deeper
I like being ugly, that way if they love me
I know that they love me for real
I like being ugly, that way if they love me
I know that they love me for real
I like being ugly, that way if they love me
I know that they love me for real (woah-oh-oh)
I like being ugly, that way if they love me
I know that they love me for real

Why wait to say, at least I did it my way
Lie awake, two faced

When I met you in the summer

And we could be together, baby
As long as skies are blue
You act so innocent now, but you lied so soon

Stand still, fallin' away from me
When it takes so long
Fire's out, what do you want to be?

Myself was never enough for me
Gotta be so strong

It's never for us to choose
I'll be the strength in you

Myself was never enough for me
Gotta be so strong

What you don't wanna do, no that ain't me, babe
Said, baby, nah nah nah, I ain't with the drama
That ain't what I need
I need you ten hut now, need you ten toes down, baby

[Pre-Chorus]
Said if you ride, baby, ride up
Pull up from behind, baby, wine up
And you and me, we can shine up
So, baby, come make your mind up

Pull up from behind, baby, wine up
And you and me, we can shine up
Said, baby, come make your mind up

[Chorus]
Beep beep, babe, I need you to skrt on me, babe
Drop down low; Said you know I need to know
'Cause you keep telling me your love ain't free, babe
But if you with it, wine up on me
'Cause the hips don't lie, baby
Drop down low; Said you know I need to know
'Cause you keep telling me your love ain't free, babe

[Verse 2]
Said, baby, I-I-I got so used to it being on a creep, babe
Yeah, maybe I-I-I got so used to just giving you the least, babe
But nowadays, I need more from ya
I need something I can keep
Said nowadays, I need real
Nowadays, I need you to take the lead

[Pre-Chorus]
Said if you ride, baby, ride up
Pull up from behind, baby, wine up

Pull up from behind, baby, wine up
And you and me, we can shine up
Say, baby, come make your mind up

[Chorus]
Beep beep, babe, I need you to skrt on me, babe
Drop down low; Said you know I need to know

Drop down low; Said you know I need to know
'Cause you keep telling me your love ain't free, babe

[Verse 3]
Ay yo, bring in the blunt, Emily Blunt
Platinum back, ice bling in the front
I'ma land the jump, Yao Ming in the dunk
And I'm playing the field, Brad Wing in the punt
I'ma tell him I love him in the foreign and cuff him
Whips in immigration, everything on them is custom
Now they calling me Billy, I'm the goat
No Achilles heel since I left Philly
Countin' them millis to billis
Beep beep beep beep, put the hurt on me
Yeah, I'm wearing jeans, but he put the skrt on me
Rode him to sleep, and then I put his shirt on me
Pussy clean, these niggas ain't got no dirt on me
Gotta play it by my rules or I swerve on him
Bout my cash money, you can ask Bird or Slim
Took him to my paradise, silk ribbon my linen
Now he got a big thing for Caribbean women

[Chorus]
Beep beep, babe, I need you to skrt on me, babe
Drop down low; Said you know I need to know
'Cause you keep telling me your love ain't free, babe
But if you with it, wine up on me
'Cause the hips don't lie, baby
Drop down low; Said you know I need to know
'Cause you keep telling me your love ain't free, babe
Beep beep, babe, I need you to skrt on me, babe
Drop down low; Said you know I need to know
'Cause you keep telling me your love ain't free, babe
But if you with it, wine up on me
'Cause the hips don't lie, baby
Drop down low; Said you know I need to know
'Cause you keep telling me your love ain't free, babe[Intro]

Can't be sleeping
Keep on waking without the woman next to me
Guilt is burning, inside I'm hurting
This ain't a feeling I can keep

[Pre-Hook: John Newman]
So blame it on the night
Don't blame it on me, don't blame it on me
Blame it on the night
Don't blame it on me, don't blame it on me

Don't blame it on me, don't blame it on me
So blame it on the night
Don't blame it on me, don't blame it on me

Can't you see it? I was manipulated
I had to let her through the door
I had no choice in this, I was the friend she missed
She needed me to talk

So blame it on the night
Don't blame it on me, don't blame it on me
Blame it on the night

Don't blame it on me

Lookin' at your last text
Damn did you even really mean it?
Did you even look through it, did you even read it?
I've been breakin' up with girls since I was 15
It's the only thing that hasn't got easier
A rubber is the only thing that ever came between us
God damn, now look at everything in between us
I mean I'm sayin'
I got more liquor, more ladies, more drugs and no cases
With jobs and no babies
I hope no phones taping and if so you gon' hate me

[Hook: Big Sean]
When you see me standing on the couches
Turnin' clubs into houses
Water to champagne fountains
Turn flat chests into mountains
And ooh I love that ass
But I hate that fucking outfit
I'm taking off her blouses
While she take off my trousers
That's just a couple more problems
To add to the couple's counselin'
Open that shit wide
Let me see how big your mouth is

Let me see how big your mouth is

[Verse 2: Big Sean]
Goin' hard 'til I OD
I'm the newest version of the old me
All my exes are on me
Wishin' they could X and O me
I'm on the edge and I'm hangin' all off
On the ledge and we danglin' off
And if I let go, I won't fall off
If we set a wedding date, don't call off
Bartender, I call the shots
We call for shots, y'all call the cops
Sometimes drinks speak louder than words do
Body language speaks louder than verbal

[Hook: Big Sean]
When you see me standing on the couches
Turnin' clubs into houses
Water to champagne fountains
Turn flat chests into mountains
And ooh I love that ass
But I hate that fucking outfit
I'm taking off her blouses
While she take off my trousers
That's just a couple more problems
To add to the couple's counselin'
Open that shit wide
Let me see how big your mouth is

Let me see how big your mouth is


[Outro: Big Sean]

Sip and sip 'til I feel like a God (God)
You're my cup overflowin' (you know it, you know it)
Fucked up and you know it (you know it, you know it)

Smokin' loud, like to pour lean (pour lean)
Luxury wheels that you know we in (know we in)
Mama said she wants me in the church (praise God)
Before the day they put me in a hearse (thank God)
But I just feel like God when the liquor hit (straight up)
If only God can judge me, then I'm innocent (straight up)
'Cause every time I'm adding up my dividends (yah)
At the same time I add my blessings up (yeah)

Oh, I remember when this road was my own
I pray to God, I just don't know anymore
I pray to God, I just don't know anymore, anymore
I lost the feeling but I try to hold on
I thought the end of a love is what made you strong
I pray to god, I just don't know anymore

[Verse 2]
When there's no getting through
I won't hold back
I will throw down anything in life, I know now
I've been lyin' on the floor
Sleeping on the ground
I will give up everything in life, I know how

[Pre-Chorus]
Cause I can't stop wondering
If I was too late to see the signs
If I could go back with hands up
I'd look up to the sky

[Chorus]
And give in
I'd give in
I'd give in
I'd give in to you, give in  to you

[Verse 3]
Oh, when the moon was shining bright before mornin'
I made a deal with the stars to keep holdin'
Shinin' bright to come and bring me back home
The lights in my eyes, they disappeared
The visions in my mind are enough to keep me from fear
I won't let it hold me down
The other way around
I don't want the words to, I can't make a sound

[Pre-Chorus]
Cause I can't stop wondering
If I was too late to see the signs
If I could go back with hands up
I'd look up to the sky

[Chorus]
And give in
I'd give in
I'd give in
I'd give in to you, give in  to you

[Bridge]
Can't hold back, reachin' out
(Hot, hot) I was livin' in the heat in the moment
Between us, I told you that
(Hot, hot) I was livin' in the heat in the moment
I'd give in
(Hot, hot) I was livin' in the heat in the moment
I'd give in
(Hot, hot) I was livin' in the heat in the moment
I'd give in
(Hot, hot) I was livin' in the heat in the moment
I'd give in  to you
Give in  to you

[Chorus]
And give in
I'd give in
I'd give in
I'd give in to you, give in  to you
And give in
I'd give in
I'd give in
I'd give in  to you, give in to you[Verse]
I feel so close to you right now

Surround me like a waterfall
And there's no stopping us right now
I feel so close to you right now

Look, open your eyes, dj vu
In ways I knew my focus remains on you
I'm so true, I love that, 'cause who woulda knew?
LBC, me? Do what it do
Question: is your bathwater ready for ya?
'Cause I could be the man for ya
Baby, are your bills paid?
Were those dinner reservations made?
The whistles, the bells, how 'bout your hair?
What about your nails?
See I can have it done for ya
Looks like I'm the one for ya
I'll crack the whip and get a little action in here, my dear
But first, relax a bit, the questions and answers are clear

[Chorus: John Legend]

A-huh-huh-huh-huh
Say the place and we go where you wanna go (where?)
She say Rodeo, I say I'm thinking 'bout Tokyo (Tokyo)
With the top gone, won't turn up the stereo (stereo)
Singing every word of my song that's on radio (aye)

Sit back, let your mind float (phew) never give up hope (no)
And if ya got a problem, let me know (let me know)
I try my best to keep you close
The life we in, no boss to match 'em on the ropes (ooh)

I can hold you, keep you safe until you fall asleep
Never worry cause I can give you what you need

[Bridge]
Now everything I do

We took it all apart
But I'm wishing I'd stayed
In the back room something I heard you say

[Refrain: Example]
We didn't want to call it too early
Now it seems a world away
But I miss that day, are we ever gonna feel the same?

[Chorus: Example]
Standing in the light 'til it's over
Out of our minds
Someone had to draw a line
We'll be coming back for you one day
We'll be coming back for you one day

Out of our minds
Sad to leave it all behind
We'll be coming back
We'll be coming back for you one day

You could see it from afar
We were riding that wave
Blinded by the lights, and it's something I crave

Gonna light up the skies, so ignore the stars

Out of our minds

[Hook: Ne-Yo]
Hey, it's now or never
Ohhh, ohhh
Let's go
Tomorrow's good, tonight is better
Ohhh, ohhh
Ohhh, let's go[Verse 1]
Tryna live my life any way I like it
Never let a simp' nigga mess up my eye lid
Something 'bout yo' eyes, they hit me by surprise, shit
Feelin' hella sprung, if you with it then you got it
I've been waitin' up, nothin' on but your chain now
Filling up the tub, what's the scent of the day now
Boy you can't resist it, boy you know you miss it
Can we find a way?

[Chorus]
5 am I can't eat right, I can't sleep night
I can't do anything without you
I've been running from you all night and now it feel like
I can't do anything without you
Want you I want you babe

Want you I want you babe
Yeah I need it baby
Want you I want you babe

[Verse 2]
What you tryna play boy, you know I'm ready
I'm like a buffet, body's yours for the taking
Almost done for breakfast, tell me you gon' make it7Hungry, hungry boy, you'll be begging for the bacon
Practising my tricks, I got plenty
Throw one down right now if you'd let me
Tell me what you like
Ride if you ready, ride if you ready, ide if you ready

[Chorus] + [Drop]

[Bridge]
Cause it's 5am, 5am I can't eat right
I can't sleep right
Won't do anything without you
Can't do anything without you

[Chorus] + [Drop][Verse 1]
Can you stay up for the weekend
And blame God for looking too old?
Can you find all that you stand for
Has been replaced with mountains of gold?
You can untrain yourself to notice
To feel pain and swallow fear
But can you stay up for the weekend
'Til next year?

[Pre-Chorus]
God, I cant do this any more
Though I'll be laid down on the floor
As many feet walk through the door
Im not alone

[Instrumental Chorus]

[Verse 2]
If I see a light flashing, could this mean that Im coming home?
If I see a man waving, does this mean that Im not alone?
If I see a light flashing, could this mean that Im coming home?
If I see a man waving, does this mean that Im not alone? No

[Instrumental Chorus]

[Verse 3]
If I see a light flashing, could this mean that Im coming home?
If I see a man waving, does this mean that Im not alone?
If I see a light flashing, could this mean that Im coming home?
If I see a man waving, does this mean that Im not alone? No

I can't believe it, every day and every night
Is gettin' better with you out of my life
It's like I flicked a switch, and now I'm feeling good
No way to stop it, now you wish that you could
When the weekend comes, I know I feel alive
You will be the last thing on my mind
No regrets, do you know what that means?

Well, it's hot, it's loud, it's wild
We'll bounce to this track

I'm coming 'round and now my vision is so clear
If I could change my state of mind, then I would disappear
The love I get from you is something I can't chance
And I could let you slip away without a second glance

Why can't I realise I'm fighting for my life?
Woaaah, woaaah

Pray to God, but I'm feeling like he's going deaf
Now when I lean on you and I got nothing left
Hey, I've been wanting to call ya, tell you that I'm sorry
Same old story everybody sing

[Pre-Chorus: Kehlani]
And I say I'm okay, but I guess I'm a liar
You say you're okay, but I saw that you liked it
2 AM and faded, I know that's when you like it
Know that's when you miss me, know that's when you crying

[Chorus: Kehlani]
Why you, why you, why you checking if you're over it?
Why you, why you say "Let go" if you're still holding it?
Just a little bit better at faking it than me, baby
Just a little bit better at faking it than me, baby
Why you, why you, why you checking if you're over it?
Why you, why you say "Let go" if you're still holding it?
Just a little bit better at faking it than me, baby
Just a little bit better at faking it than me, baby

[Verse 2: Kehlani]
Nowadays, I'm just - to everybody else
I don't need no shoulders, I'm good crying by myself
Moving on's a chore, 'cause you know I still adore ya
An unrequited love is just a lover's hell

[Pre-Chorus: Kehlani]
And I say I'm okay, but I guess I'm a liar
You say you're okay, but I saw that you liked it
2 AM and faded, I know that's when you like it
Know that's when you miss me, know that's when you crying

[Chorus: Kehlani]
Why you, why you, why you checking if you're over it?
Why you, why you say "Let go" if you're still holding it?

Why you, why you, why you checking if you're over it?
Why you, why you say "Let go" if you're still holding it?

Just a little bit better at faking it than me, baby

[Verse 3: Lil Yachty]
(Lil Boat, Lil Boat, Lil Boat, Lil Boat, Lil Boat)
I'm not gonna act like I don't love ya baby
'Cause deep in my mind, girl, I know I do (true)
Tried to search all through the world not well
But I can't find a girl that lives close like you (no!)
I done made millions of dollars
But I'm still alone until I come home back to you (yah!)
I remember all of the times we were parked by your house
And laughed out on your avenue
Whoa, you can't front
You're a stone cold diva (yaah!)
I had to get counseling from my moms
She's a heartbreak teacher (oh, yah!)
Remember that time I put those pepperonis on your face
Made you a creature
Now I think about you every single time I eat pizza, ohh

[Chorus: Kehlani]
Why you, why you, why you checking if you're over it?
Why you, why you say "Let go" if you're still holding it?
Just a little bit better at faking it than me, baby
Just a little bit better at faking it than me, baby
Why you, why you, why you checking if you're over it?
Why you, why you say "Let go" if you're still holding it?
Just a little bit better at faking it than me, baby
Just a little bit better at faking it than me, baby[Intro]

Stay on your hustle, you be on your grind
Rip out your heart and left it on the line

I told you once, ain't gotta tell you twice
If life's a game, I'm throwing loaded dice
These other girls ain't really what ya like, what ya like
Feeling like running away
Stressing 'bout nothing all day

Let them go, fuck 'em away-ay

I need a little space in my mind
I need that little hope I can find
I need a little, I need a little faith

[Verse 1: Frank Ocean]
All this jewelry ain't no use when it's this dark
It's my favorite part, we see the lights, they got so far
It went too fast, we couldn't reach it with our arms
Wrist on a wrist, a link of charms, yeah
Laying, we're still a link apart
It's like we could die here all young
Like we could dye hair all blonde
If we could see in twenty twin
Twice we could see it 'til the end (I might)

Counterfeit, counterfeit, that's what you're shouting at me
I could run but I'd sooner have this end amicably
Lick the blood stain from your finger, say, "What do you see?"
Remind you that whatever you get is what you want it to be
(You want it to be)

[Pre-Chorus: Calvin Harris]
You get a feeling, that's what you choose
And I was told there's not a minute to lose
So if you're waiting, jump out your skin
To find a cure for whatever state you're in
I tell my good friends, get out the way
Of all the lightning hitting the trees today
We get a thrill from clapping our hands
We find the nearest girl and ask her to dance

[Chorus: Mary Pearce]
Ooh, I put on my shoes and I'm ready for the weekend
Ooh, I put on my shoes and I'm ready for the weekend
Ooh, I put on my shoes and I'm ready for the weekend

Weekend, weekend, weekend

[Verse 2: Calvin Harris]
Coming back, coming back to a place where I never knew
Pushing knobs, pushing faders, but I don't know what they do
This reflection in my mirror reminds me of you
When I tilt it towards the sunlight, you fall out of view
(You fall out of view)

[Pre-Chorus: Calvin Harris]
You get a feeling, that's what you choose
And I was told there's not a minute to lose
So if you're waiting, jump out your skin

Of all the lightning hitting the trees today
We get a thrill from clapping our hands
We find the nearest girl and ask her to dance

Always running from what feels right
Too fast and I didn't know
Then I'm in a toast daylight
You're here, no way to let go
Don't look back when you're holding me
Cause I know what this love was meant to be

[Chorus]
One day, we're gonna wake up together
You won't wanna go home
We'll find love here together
And it feels so good in my arms
We're gonna wake up together
You won't wanna go home
We'll find love here forever
Cause we'll wake up together

[Verse 2]
I got something and it feels right
What I needed to be, can't control what you feel for me
I was watching you the whole night
I can never explain how the magic was made
Don't look back when you're holding me
Cause I know what this love was meant to be

[Chorus]
One day, we're gonna wake up together
You won't wanna go home
We'll find love here together
And it feels so good in my arms
We're gonna wake up together
You won't wanna go home
We'll find love here forever

Fall back and touch the night
And reach for the blinding light
Cause everybody says that we're too young to see
We know that we're brave enough to be

[Chorus: Theo Hutchcraft]
In the state of ecstasy
In the place we're meant to be
In the state of ecstasy
There is only you and me

Break through from the other side
And lead me to Paradise
Cause nothing but love can take us away from here
Every time I close my eyes, we disappear

Somethin' must've gone wrong in my brain
Got your chemicals all in my veins
Feelin' all the highs, feelin' all the pain
Let go of the wheel, that's the bullet lane
Now I'm seein' red, not thinkin' straight
Blurrin' all the lines, you intoxicate me

Suddenly, I'm a fiend and you're all I need
All I need, yeah, you're all I need

It's you, babe
And I'm a sucker for the way that you move, babe
And I could try to run, but it would be useless
You're to blame
Just one hit of you, I knew I'll never be the same
It's you, babe
And I'm a sucker for the way that you move, babe
And I could try to run, but it would be useless
You're to blame
Just one hit of you, I knew I'll never ever, ever be the same

I'll never be the same

Just one hit of you, I knew I'll never be the same (I'll never be the...)
It's you, babe
And I'm a sucker for the way that you move, babe
And I could try to run, but it would be useless
You're to blame
Just one hit of you, I knew I'll never ever, ever be the same[Verse 1]
You think that you'll die without him
You know, that's a lie that you tell yourself
You fear that you lay alone forever now
It ain't true, ain't true, ain't true, no

[Pre-Chorus]
So put your arms around me tonight
Let the music lift you up
Like you've never been so high
Open up your heart to me
Let the music lift you up
Like you've never been this free
'Til you feel the sunrise
Let the music warm your body
Like the heat of a thousand fires
The heat of a thousand fires

[Chorus]
Ain't no crying in the club (hey, hey)
Let the beat carry away, your tears as they fall, baby
Ain't no crying in the club (hey, hey)
With a little faith, your tears turn to ecstasy
Ain't no crying in the club
I won't, I won't, I...
Ain't no crying in the club
I won't, I won't, I...
Ain't no crying in the club

[Verse 2]
You may think that you'll die without her
But you know, that's a lie that you told yourself
You fear that you'll never meet another so pure
It ain't true, ain't true, ain't true, no

[Pre-Chorus]
So put your arms around me tonight
Let the music lift you up
Like you've never been so high
Open up your heart to me
Let the music lift you up
Like you've never been this free
'Til you feel the sunrise
Let the music warm your body
Like the heat of a thousand fires
The heat of a thousand fires

[Chorus]
Ain't no crying in the club (hey, hey)
Let the beat carry away, your tears as they fall, baby
Ain't no crying in the club (hey, hey)
With a little faith, your tears turn to ecstasy
Ain't no crying in the club
I won't, I won't, I...
Ain't no crying in the club
I won't, I won't, I...
Ain't no crying in the club

[Bridge]
You think that you'll die without him
You know, that's a lie that you tell yourself
You fear that you lay alone forever now
It ain't true, ain't true, ain't true
I said ain't no... (ain't no...)
Ain't no crying...
Ain't no crying in the club, no crying...
I said ain't no... (ain't no...)
Ain't no crying...
Ain't no crying in the club, no crying...
Woah!

[Chorus]
Ain't no crying in the club (hey, hey)
Let the beat carry away, your tears as they fall, baby
Ain't no crying in the club (hey, hey)
With a little faith, your tears turn to ecstasy
Ain't no crying in the club
I won't, I won't, I...
Ain't no crying in the club
I won't, I won't, I...
Ain't no crying in the club (I won't cry, I won't cry, I won't cry no more)
I won't, I won't, I...
Ain't no crying in the club (I won't cry, I won't cry, I won't cry no more)
I won't, I won't, I...
Ain't no crying in the club[Verse 1]
No, I think I'll stay in tonight
Skip the conversations and the "Oh, I'm fine's"
No, I'm no stranger to surprise
This paper town has let me down too many times
Why do I even try?
Give me a reason why
I thought that I could trust you, never mind
Why all the switching sides?
Where do I draw the line?
I guess I'm too naive to read the signs

[Chorus]
I'm just lookin' for some real friends
All they ever do is let me down
Every time I let somebody in
Then I find out what they're all about
I'm just lookin' for some real friends
Wonder where they're all hidin' out
I'm just lookin' for some real friends
Gotta get up out of this town (oh, ooh)

[Post-Chorus]
Oh, yeah

[Verse 2]
I stay up, talkin' to the moon (ooh)
Been feelin' so alone in every crowded room
Can't help but feel like something's wrong, yeah
'Cause the place I'm livin' in
Just doesn't feel like home

[Chorus]
I'm just lookin' for some real friends
All they ever do is let me down
Every time I let somebody in
Then I find out what they're all about
I'm just lookin' for some real friends
Wonder where they're all hidin' out
I'm just lookin' for some real friends
Gotta get up out of this town

[Post-Chorus]
Oh
Lookin' for some real friends
Oh, oh-oh

[Bridge]
I just wanna talk about nothin'
With somebody that means something
Spell the names of all the dreams and demons
For the times that I don't understand
Tell me, what's the point of a moon like this
When I'm alone again?
Can I run away to somewhere beautiful
Where nobody knows my name?

[Chorus]
I'm just lookin' for some real friends
All they ever do is let me down
Then, I let somebody in
But I find out what they're all about
I'm just lookin' for some real friends
All they ever do is let me down
I'm just lookin' for some real friends
Gotta get up out of this town, yeah

[Post-Chorus]
Oh (ah)
Oh, yeah, ah[Chorus: Camila Cabello]
They say he likes a good time (My oh my)
He comes alive at midnight (Everynight)
Mymama doesn't trusthim (My oh my)
He's only herefor one thing, but (So am I)

[Verse 1: Camila Cabello]
Yeah, a little bit older, a black leather jacket
A bad reputation, insatiable habits
He was onto me, one look and I couldn't breathe, yeah
I said, if he kissed me, I might let it happen (Oh)

[Pre-Chorus: Camila Cabello]
I swear on my life that I've been a good girl (Oh)
Tonight, I don't wanna be her

[Chorus: Camila Cabello & DaBaby]

He's only here for one thing, but (Let's go, so am I)

[Verse 2: DaBaby & Camila Cabello]
Look, I'm the type to make her turn on her daddy (Oh yeah)
DaBaby make her forget what she learned from her daddy
I don't be tripping on lil' shawty, I let her do whatever she please
I don't be kissing on lil' shawty, she don't be kissing on me either
She came with you, then left with me
I went up a point, let's call it even (Yeah, yeah)
Don't like the car she in, gon' end up buyin' her a new Bimmer (Let's go)
That girl know what she want, she make me take it off when she see me (Let's go)
She say I make her wet whenever my face pop up on TV
I had to say, "No disrespect, gotta do it safe or you can keep it"
Pop star, I'm fresh up out the trap and I'm going Bieber
She know I'm a call away, she can drop a pin and I'd come meet her
Stand next to me, you gon' end up catchin' a fever (Yeah, yeah)
I'm hot

[Pre-Chorus: Camila Cabello]
I swear on my life that I've been a good girl (Good girl, good girl)
Tonight, I don't wanna be her

He's only here for one thing, but (So am I)

[Bridge: Camila Cabello]
My, my, my, my, my oh my
My mama doesn't trust you, baby
My, my, my, my, my oh my
And my daddy doesn't know you, no
My, my, my, my, my oh my (Oh my, my, my, my, my)
My, my, my, my, my oh my (My, my, my, ooh)

[Chorus: Camila Cabello]
They say he likes a good time (My oh my)
He comes alive at midnight (Every night)
My mama doesn't trust him (My oh my)
He's only here for one thing, but (So am I)[Verse 1]
Don't speak, no, don't try
It's been a secret for the longest time
Don't run (Oh), no, don't hide
Been running from it for the longest time

[Pre-Chorus]
So many mornings I woke up confused
In my dreams, I do anything I want to you
My emotions are naked, they're taking me out of my mind

[Chorus]
Right now, I'm shameless
Screamin' my lungs out for ya
Not afraid to face it
I need you more than I want to
Need you more than I want to
Show me you're shameless
Write it on my neck, why don't ya?
And I won't erase it
I need you more than I want to
Need you more than I want to

[Post-Chorus]
No-oh, uh-uh, don't wanna do this now
No-oh, uh-uh, don't wanna do this now
No-oh, uh-uh, don't wanna do this now
No-oh, uh-uh, don't wanna do this now

[Verse 2]
So we're there, now it's real
Now that you have me, do you want me still?
My kisses are history, they go back a long time, uh
And I'm tired of loving somebody that's not mine, no

[Pre-Chorus]
So many mornings I woke up confused
In my dreams, I do anything I want to you
My emotions are naked, they're taking me out of my mind (Mind)

[Chorus]
Right now, I'm shameless
Screamin' my lungs out for ya
Not afraid to face it
I need you more than I want to
Need you more than I want to
Show me you're shameless
Write it on my neck, why don't ya?
And I won't erase it
I need you more than I want to
Need you more than I want to

[Post-Chorus]
No-oh, uh-uh, don't wanna do this now
No-oh, uh-uh, don't wanna do this now
No-oh, uh-uh, don't wanna do this now
No-oh, uh-uh, don't wanna do this now

[Bridge]
Distance, inches in between us
I want you to give in, I want you to give in, oh
Weakness, tension in between us
I just wanna give in
And I don't care if I'm forgiven

[Chorus]
Right now, I'm shameless
Screamin' my lungs out for ya
Not afraid to face it
I need you more than I want to
Need you more than I want to
Show me you're shameless
Write it on my neck, why don't ya?
And I won't erase it
I need you more than I want to
I need you more than I want to

[Post-Chorus]
No-oh, uh-uh, don't wanna do this now
No-oh, uh-uh, don't wanna do this now
No-oh, uh-uh, don't wanna do this now
No-oh, uh-uh, don't wanna do this now[Verse 1]
Dirty tissues, trust issues
Glasses on the sink, they didn't fix you
Lonely pillows in a stranger's bed
Little voices in my head
Secret keeping, stop the bleeding
Lost a little weight because I wasn't eating
All the songs that I can't listen to, to tell the truth

[Chorus 1]
Loving you was young, and wild, and free
Loving you was cool, and hot, and sweet
Loving you was sunshine, safe and sound
A steady place to let down my defenses
But loving you had consequences

[Verse 2]
Hesitation, awkward conversation
Running on low expectation
Every siren that I was ignoring
I'm paying for it

[Chorus 1]
Loving you was young, and wild, and free
Loving you was cool, and hot, and sweet
Loving you was sunshine, safe and sound
A steady place to let down my defenses
But loving you had consequences

[Bridge]
No, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Said, no, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Hey, yeah, no, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, mm

[Chorus 2]
Loving you was dumb, dark, and cheap
Loving you will still take shots at me
Found loving you was sunshine, but then it poured
And I lost so much more than my senses
'Cause loving you had consequences

[Outro]
Yeah, loving you[Verse 1]
Why did you leave me here to burn?
I'm way too young to be this hurt
I feel doomed in hotel rooms
Staring straight up at the wall
Counting wounds, and I am trying to numb them all

[Refrain]
Do you care, do you care?
Why don't you care?
I gave you all of me
My blood, my sweat, my heart, and my tears
Why don't you care, why don't you care?
I was there, I was there, when no one was
Now you're gone, and I'm here

[Chorus 1]
I have questions for you
Number one, tell me who you think you are
You got some nerve trying to tear my faith apart
(I have questions for you)
Number two, why would you try and play me for a fool?
I should have never ever ever trusted you (I have questions)
Number three, why weren't you
Who you swore that you would be?
I have questions, I got questions haunting me
I have questions for you
I have questions for you (I have questions)
I have questions for you

[Verse 2]
My, my name was safest in your mouth
And why'd you have to go and spit it out?
Oh, your voice, it was the most familiar sound
But it sounds so dangerous to me now

[Chorus 2]
I have questions for you (He-ey)
Number one, tell me who you think you are
You got some nerve trying to tear my faith apart
(I have questions for you)
Number two, why would you try and play me for a fool?
I should have never ever ever trusted you
I have questions for you
I have questions for you
I have questions for you (I have questions)
I have questions for you

[Refrain]
Do you care, do you care?
Why don't you care?
I gave you all of me
My blood, my sweat, my heart, and my tears
Why don't you care, why don't you care?
I was there, I was there, when no one was
Now you're gone, and I'm here

[Outro]
I have questions for you (ooh)
I have questions for you
I have questions for you (I have questions)
I have questions for you (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
I have questions for you (ooh)
I have questions for you (foul play, no, foul play, no)
I have questions for you (I have questions)
I have questions for you
I have questions for you
How do I fix it? Can we talk? Can we communicate? Can we talk? Do I wanna fix it?
I have questions for you (I'm afraid of you)
Is it my fault? Is it my fault? Do you miss me?
I have questions[Verse 1: Camila Cabello]
Baby, what'cha say?
I ain't here to, I ain't here to conversate
Baby, I don't play
From Miami, causin' trouble in LA
Rowdy, Tennessee
If I don't send for you, best not come for me
Jordan, 23
Guarantee you're gonna wanna leave with me
I got that li-li-li-like

[Chorus: Camila Cabello]
Pull up, pull up, pull up straight from Tokyo
You cannot believe it when we come through
Woo, my God, you look good today

Lose your concentration when you take a sip, yeah (Sip it, sip it)
Cyclone, make it spin
'Cause all I, all I, all I, all I do is win

[Bridge: Camila Cabello]
Yeah, I'm cut like a diamond, I'm cold
4 A.M., bloom like a rose
Girls like the summer, we're gold, uh
We got that li-li-li-like

[Chorus: Camila Cabello]
Pull up, pull up, pull up straight from Tokyo
You cannot believe it when we come through (Yeah, yeah)
Woo, my God, you look good today

Me and you, that's a iso
Waist so small, look like lipo (Li-lipo)
Moonwalk, my diamonds Michael (Mi-Michael)
She's so fine, I call my best man (Brr)
Ain't no rings on her left hand (No rings)
I had a dream I was in quicksand (Dream)
Then I woke up with the best plans (Yeah)
Oh my God, yeah (Uh)

Smoke more green than Boston (Green)

Havin' her mad at me, tackle me like I'm an athlete (Ooh, yeah)

Pull up, pull up, pull up straight from Tokyo
You cannot believe it when we come through

Tell me something, but say it with your hands, slow
When you touch me, paint me like a Van Gogh (Oh)
I wanna study every inch of you
'Til you trust me to make the angels come through

[Pre-Chorus]
Like a choir singing "Hallelujah"
When my body's crashin' right into ya
When we align, ooh yeah
Do you feel me?
Can you feel me?
'Cause I can't breathe

[Chorus]
Where did you come from, baby?
And were you sent to save me?

Ooh, and you're the living proof (Oh)
The way your hands can shake me
Soft to the touch like, baby
Ooh, there's God in every move
Ooh, and you're the living proof (Oh)

[Verse 2]
Count the freckles, as they run down your spine
Show your demons, and I might show you mine
One at a time, yeah, yeah, what are you hidin'?
What a design, yeah, yeah, I wanna dive in
What a divine moment
Can you feel me? (Oh)
Can you feel me? (Oh)
'Cause I can't breathe

[Chorus]
Where did you come from, baby?

And you're the living proof (Oh)[Verse 1]
Loving you, I thought I couldn't get no higher
Your November rain could set the night on fire, night on fire
But we could only burn so long
Counterfeit emotions only run skin deep
Know you're lying when you're lying next to me, next to me
How did we get so far gone?

[Pre-Chorus]
I should know by now
You should know by now
We should know by now

[Chorus]
Something's gotta give, something's gotta break
But all I do is give, and all you do is take
Something's gotta change, but I know that it won't
No reason to stay is a good reason to go
Is a good reason to go, ooh

[Verse 2]
I have never heard a silence quite so loud
I walk in the room and you don't make a sound, make a sound
You're good at making me feel small
If it doesn't hurt me, why do I still cry?
If it didn't kill me, then I'm half alive, half alive
How did we get so far gone?

[Pre-Chorus]
I should know by now
You should know by now
We should know by now

[Chorus]
Something's gotta give, something's gotta break
But all I do is give, and all you do is take
Something's gotta change, but I know that it won't
No reason to stay is a good reason to go
Is a good reason to go

[Bridge]
I should know by now, you should know by now
I think I'm breaking right now, ooh
I should know by now, you should know by now
I think I'm breaking right now

[Chorus]
Something's gotta give, something's gotta break
But all I do is give, and all you do is take
Something's gotta change, but I know that it won't
No reason to stay is a good reason to go
Is a good reason to go, ooh

[Outro]
Something's gotta give[Verse 1]
Cold, 'cause she has been here before
She doesnt cry anymore, no looking back
No, she doesn't go to the bar
Too many lovers she's scarred, and they want her back

[Chorus]
She loves control, she wants it her way
And there's no way she'll ever stay unless you give it up
(Give it up)
She loves control, she wants it her way
And all it takes is just one taste, you wanna give it up
(Give it up)

[Verse 2]
Bold, you know she lives for the thrill
You know she lusts for the kill, so they won't come back
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no
Don't, don't you try taming the storm
Don't say you haven't been warned (oh)
'Cause she won't like that, like that

[Chorus]
'Cause she loves control, she wants it her way
And there's no way she'll ever stay unless you give it up
She loves control, she wants it her way
And all it takes is just one taste, you wanna give it up
(Give it up, give it up for love)

[Post-Chorus]
She loves control (control, hey)
She loves control (control, hey)

[Bridge]
Say what you want
But the way she kills you makes you feel alive
And you know that it feels right

[Chorus]
She loves control, she wants it her way
And there's no way she'll ever stay unless you give it up
She loves control, she wants it her way
And all it takes is just one taste, you wanna give it up

[Post-Chorus]
She loves control (control, hey)
She loves, she loves
She loves, she loves
Oh, you know that she loves it
She can't live without it, no
She loves control (control, hey)
Control, hey[Chorus: Camila Cabello & Pharrell Williams]

[Verse 2: Camila Cabello]
I knew I was there when I read the sign
(Welcome to La Yuma)
I knew it was him when he hugged from behind
(It gets me every time)
He's put in work, but it's in the streets
(He said: "girl, can you ride?")
And this is the part that my daddy told me

Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha

[Verse 1]
You tell me that I'm complicated
And that might be an understatement
Anything else? (Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha)
You tell methatI'm indecisive
Fickle, butI try to hide it
Anything else?(Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha)
You tell me that I overthink
'Til I ruin a good thing
Anything else? (Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha)
You tell me that you'd rather fight
Than spend a single peaceful night
With somebody else (Ha-ha-ha-ha)

[Pre-Chorus]
You really, really know me
The future and the old me
All of the mazes and the madness in my mind
You really, really love me
You know me and you love me
And it's the kind of thing I always hoped I'd find, yeah

[Chorus]
Always thought I was hard to love
'Til you made it seem so easy, seem so easy
Always thought I was hard to love
'Til you made it seem so easy, seem so easy
Touch me 'til I find myself in a feeling
Tell me with your hands that you're never leaving (No)
Always thought I was hard to love
'Til you made it seem so easy (Seem so easy)

[Verse 2]
I never liked my crooked teeth
You tell me they're your favorite thing (Mm-hmm)
Anything else? (Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha)
The stretch marks all around my thighs
Kiss 'em 'til I change my mind
About everything else (Ha-ha-ha-ha)

[Pre-Chorus]
You really, really know me
The future and the old me
All of the mazes and the madness in my mind
You really, really love me
You know me and you love me (Ah)

[Chorus]
Always thought I was hard to love
'Til you made it seem so easy, seem so easy (So easy, yeah)

Tell me with your hands that you're never leaving (Oh, never)
Always thought I was hard to love (To love, yeah)
'Til you made it seem so easy, seem so easy (Oh)

All I know is you
Heal me when I'm broken
Heal me when I'm broken, oh
All I know is you
Saved me and you know it
Saved me and you know it (Saved me and you know it, ah)

[Chorus]
Always thought I was hard to love
'Til you made it seem so easy, seem so easy (Ah)

Touch me 'til I find myself in a feeling
Tell me with your hands that you're never leaving (Tell me with your hands that you're)

'Til you made it seem so easy, seem so easy[Verse 1]
Your hair's grown a little longer
Your arms look a little stronger
Your eyes just as I remember (Ooh)
Your smile's just a little softer

[Pre-Chorus]
And I, yeah, I never prepared for a moment like that
Yeah, in a second it all came back, it all came back

[Chorus]
'Cause after all these years
I still feel everything when you are near
And it was just a quick "Hello," and you had to go
And you probably will never know
You're still the one I'm after all these years
(Ah, yeah)

[Verse 2]
Couldn't help but overhear you
Sounds like you're happy with her (Ooh-ooh, ooh)
But does she kiss you like I kissed you?
Ooh, I wish I loved you like I miss you

[Pre-Chorus]
And I, yeah, I never prepared for a moment like that
Yeah, in a second it all came back, it all came back

[Chorus]
'Cause after all these years
I still feel everything when you are near
And it was just a quick "Hello," and you had to go
And you probably will never know
You're still the one I'm after all these years, oh
'Cause after all these years
I still feel everything when you are near (You are near)
And it was just a quick "Hello," and you had to go (Ooh)
And you probably will never know
You're still the one I'm after all these years

[Bridge]
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah, yeah, yeah

Yes, I'm gonna stay with him tonight
Ill see you in the mornin'
No, of course he won't drink and drive
Can you say bye to mom for me?
Oh, youll like him, he's really kind
And he's funny like you sometimes
And I found someone I really like
Maybe for the first time

[Pre-Chorus]
No, I don't need a jacket
It's not that cold tonight
And you worry, I get it
But he's waitin' outside

[Chorus]
I swear on my heart that he's a good man
I know youll stay up late just waitin for me
You held me so tight, now someone else can
But you were the first man that really loved me

[Verse 2]
Now you're driving to the airport
Not just me you pick up anymore
Ive got eight days off comin' up
And I can only come home for four

[Pre-Chorus]
Yeah, I just met his family
They're just like you and mom (Oh)
He makes me really happy
I think he might be the one, oh

[Chorus]
I swear on my heart that he's a good man
I promise he loves me, hed never hurt me
You held me so tight, now someone else can
But you were the first man that really loved me
Now you're on the driveway, faking a smile
You wish you could tell him he doesn't deserve me
So I had to stop the car and turn around
To tell you you were the first man that really loved me

[Post-Chorus]
Ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah
Ah

[Bridge]
And before they open up the doors
I say, "I've never seen you cry before"
You say, "You've never looked so beautiful
You know you'll always be my little girl"

[Chorus]
You're looking at me while walking down the aisle
With tears in your eyes, maybe he deserves me
You don't even know how much it means to me now
That you were the first man that really loved me
Oh, really loved me
Oh, you really love me[Intro: Pharrell Williams]

He's put in work, but it's in the streets
(He said, "girl, can you ride?")
And this is the part that my daddy told me
He got me feelin' like

Know just how to make me miss ya
When I'm feelin' sentimental
Goin' in ourseparateways

Losin' youI couldn't face
But to love you is worse
Waitin' for ya just in case
One day it doesn't hurt, nah, nah, nah

[Pre-Chorus]
Said it's the last time, but nah, nah, nah, nah
Just like the last time, yeah, nah, nah, nah, nah
Tired of building up my walls, yeah
Just to watch them fall again

[Chorus]
So fuck this love callin' my name
Get out of my veins
If you need your space, then just walk away
You know how to fuck me up, then make it okay
I guess that's just your game, and I'm the one who gets played
Again, and again, and again, and again

[Verse 2]
Maybe you should set me free
Maybe I don't really want you to
Maybe I just wanna be
Be the person that you just can't lose
If you're gonna leave, then go
If you need me, let me know
Love me or just let me go
But no, nah, nah, nah

Maybe you should set me free
Maybe I don't really want you to
Maybe I just wanna be
Be the person that you just can't lose

Get out of my veins (Get out of my veins)
If you need your space, then just walk away

And I'm the one who gets played
Again, and again, and again, and again, and again

Blank stares, faithless
Vampires at the same places
Shadows, traces

You're runnin, runnin', runnin', runnin
Making the rounds with all your fake friends
Runnin', runnin' away from it
You can strip down without showing skin, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
I can see you're scared of your emotions
I can see you're hoping, you're not hopeless
So why can't you show me?
Why can't you show me?
I can see youre looking for distractions
I can see youre tired of the acting
So why can't you show me?

[Chorus]
Who are you in the dark? (I, I)

Who are you when its 3AM and you're all alone
And L.A. doesn't feel like home? (I, I, I)

But you don't even know what her name is
Secrets, endless

And I'mall good now, someone else is gettin' all of me (Ah)
If you wanted me so desperately, you shoulda said it

[Verse 1]
Show up at my door, but I don't live there anymore
Sendin' me our songs, but they don't really sound like before
I was crazy for you, all caught up and confused (Ah)
Love was broken for me, now it's broken for you

[Pre-Chorus]
You're only lonely
Now that you ain't the one to hold me
Only lonely now

[Chorus]
So you want me now? That's funny
'Cause you didn't give a... back then
Comin' back around, so sorry
'Cause there's no room in my bed
And I'm all good now, someone else is gettin' all of me (Ah)
If you wanted me so desperately, you shoulda said it

[Verse 2]
Isn't it somethin' that I get more when I'm givin' you nothin'? (Huh)
Isn't it magic that when you stop lookin' for it, it happens? (Oh)
Baby, he fell from grace, landed right in your place
Kissed me so many times that I forgot your taste

[Pre-Chorus]
You're only lonely
Now that you ain't the one to hold me
Only lonely now, now

[Chorus]
So you want me now? That's funny (Hey)

If you wanted me so desperately, you shoulda said it

[Post-Chorus]
You shoulda said it, love
Shoulda said it
Shoulda said it, love

[Bridge]
I wish that you could turn back the time
You'd hold me closer instead of your pride (Ooh, oh)
I knew it was you from the very first night
And it took you two years to make up your mind

[Chorus]
So you want me now? That's funny
'Cause you didn't give a... back then
Comin' back around, so sorry (Ayy)
'Cause there's no room in my bed

Don't you, babe? (Don't you, babe?Huh?)
Didyou forget
You saidthat, in this lifetime, you couldnever get over me?
Are you over me? (Uh)

[Pre-Chorus]
When I said I hope you're happy, didn't mean it
Never thought you'd be so good at moving on (On)
When I'm lying wide awake, you're probably sleeping (Ha)
And maybe what I'm thinking is wrong

[Chorus]
I want you to cry for me, cry for me
Say you'd d-d-die for me, die for me
And if you can't, then baby, lie for me, lie for me (Huh)
'Cause you haunt me when I'm dreamin'
And it's time you know the feeling
So cry for me

[Verse 2]
See that pretty life in pictures (Ha)
See her lips erasing me (Mm)
You're so good to her, it's vicious
Yeah, she should be thanking me
Who, who's gonna touch you like me?
Yeah, tell me who
Who can make you forget about me? (Oh)

[Pre-Chorus]
When I said I hope you're happy, didn't mean it (Didn't mean it, yeah)
Never thought you'd be so good at moving on (On, on)
When I'm lying wide awake, you're probably sleeping (Sleeping)
And maybe what I'm thinking is wrong

Say you'd d-d-die for me, die for me
And if you can't, then baby, lie for me, lie for me (Lie)
'Cause you haunt me when I'm dreamin'
And it's time you know the feeling
So, baby, won't you cry for me, cry for me? (Cry for me)
Say you'd d-d-die for me, die for me (Oh, won't you cry?)

And it's time you know the feeling (And it's time you know the feeling, baby, cry)
So, baby, won't you cry for me, cry for me? (Cry out, yeah)
Say you'd d-d-die for me, die for me (Cry out, yeah, cry out, yeah)

Something must've gone wrong in my brain
Got your chemicals all in my veins
Feeling all the highs, feel all the pain
Let go of the wheel, it's the borderline
Now Im seeing red, not thinking straight
Blurring all the lines, you intoxicate me

[Pre-Chorus]
Just like nicotine, rushin' me, touching me
Suddenly, Im a fiend and youre all I need
All I need, yeah, you're all I need

[Chorus]
Its you, babe
And Im a sucker for the way that you move, babe
And I could try to run, but it would be useless
Youre to blame
Just one hit of you, I knew Ill never be the same
Its you, babe
And Im a sucker for the way that you move, babe
And I could try to run, but it would be useless
Youre to blame
Just one hit of you, I knew Ill never ever, ever be the same

[Post-Chorus]
I'll never be the same
I'll never be the same
I'll never be the same

[Verse 2]
Sneaking in L.A. when the lights are low
Off of one touch, I could overdose
He said, "Stop playing it safe
Girl, I wanna see you lose control"

[Pre-Chorus]
Just like nicotine, rushin' me, touching me
Suddenly, Im a fiend and youre all I need
All I need, yeah, you're all I need

[Chorus]
It's you, babe
And I'm a sucker for the way that you move, babe
And I could try to run, but it would be useless
You're to blame
Just one hit of you, I knew I'll never be the same
It's you, babe
And Im a sucker for the way that you move, babe
And I could try to run, but it would be useless
Youre to blame
Just one hit of you, I knew Ill never ever, ever be the same

[Post-Chorus]
I'll never be the same
I'll never be the same
I'll never be the same

[Bridge]
You're in my blood, you're in my veins, you're in my head (I blame)
You're in my blood, you're in my veins, you're in my head (I'm sayin')

[Chorus]
Its you, babe
And Im a sucker for the way that you move, babe
And I could try to run, but it would be useless
Youre to blame (you're to blame)
Just one hit of you, I knew Ill never be the same (I'll never be the...)
Its you, babe
And Im a sucker for the way that you move, babe
And I could try to run, but it would be useless
Youre to blame
Just one hit of you, I knew Ill never ever, ever be the same[Intro]
Oh

[Verse 1]
Oh, I'm scared if I look in your eyes, I might see your soul
I knowloveis the loneliestplace when you fall alone

[Pre-Chorus]
Sitting bythe phone, holding onto hope
Spending all night wondering why you let me go (You let me go)
I wish you had felt how you're feeling two years ago
Oh, nah

[Chorus]
Hurts me to hurt you, baby
Lying awake and everything has changed
Keeping our distance lately
Kills me to kill you when I tell you
That I felt it once, I can't feel it twice
It's more than I can take, baby
Hurts me to tell you I don't feel the same

[Verse 2]
I can feel you still staring at me when I look away
Can't imagine the pain that you feel when I kiss his face

[Pre-Chorus]
That's when you said
"How can I be your friend when I know the way you taste?
It's almost 2 AM and I can't ask you to stay"
I don't know what's worse, getting broken or making it break
Oh, ah

[Chorus]
Hurts me to hurt you, baby
Lying awake and everything has changed
Keeping our distance lately
Kills me to kill you when I tell you
That I felt it once, I can't feel it twice
It's more than I can take, baby
Hurts me to tell you I don't feel the same

[Chorus]
Hurts me to hurt you, babe
Feels like there's nothing that I can say
Hurts me to hurt you, babe
Kills me I have to walk away
'Cause I felt it once, I can't feel it twice
It's more than I can take, baby
Hurts me to tell you I don't feel the same

[Outro]
The same, oh yeah
The same, oh
The same, oh yeah, oh yeah
The same
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh[Verse 1]
Ooh, I'm not a psychic
But I see myself all over you (ooh)
Ooh, I'm sick on you, sick on you
But you're the medicine, too (ooh)

[Pre-Chorus]
The gravity can't hold us, your hands are outer space
I can't make sense of nothing and words just get in the way
This couch is getting smaller, but it's my favorite place
Don't even ask the question, you know what I'm gonna say

[Chorus]
I'm into it
Whatever trouble that you're thinking, I could get into it
I see a king-sized bed in the corner, we should get into it
All of the things, I wanna do to you is infinite
I mean, if you're into it, I'm into it

[Verse 2]
Ooh, I'm holding my, holding my breath
Until I'm turning blue (yeah, yeah)
Ooh, don't save me, don't save me, don't save me
I'll fall into you, fall into you

[Pre-Chorus]
This couch is getting smaller, but it's my favorite place
Don't even ask the question, you know what I'm gonna say

[Chorus]
I'm into it
Whatever trouble that you're thinking, I could get into it
I see a king-sized bed in the corner, we should get into it
All of the things, I wanna do to you is infinite
I mean, if you're into it, I'm into it

[Chorus Reprise]
I'm into it, I'm into it
Whatever trouble that you're thinking
I could get into it (I'm into it)
I see a king-sized bed in the corner
We should get into it (I'm into it)
Enough of the conversation, baby, let's get into it (I'm into it)
I mean, if you're into it, I'm into it

[Pre-Chorus]
The gravity can't hold us, your hands are outer space
I can't make sense of nothing, oh
This couch is getting smaller, but it's my favorite place
Don't even ask the question
You know what I'm gonna say (say baby)

[Chorus]
I'm into it
Whatever trouble that you're thinking, I could get into it (thinking, I...)
I see a king-sized bed in the corner, we should get into it  (into it, yeah)
All of the things I wanna do to you is infinite (everything is infinite)
I mean, if you're into it, I'm into it (if you're into it)
I'm into it, I'm into it

[Outro]
I'm into it, oh na na, I'm into it
I'm into it, oh na na, I'm into it

He's a bad dancer, he's a right answer
He's a shy singer most of the time
Unlessit'shim and I
He'san over-thinker, he's a slow kisser
Aconfessed sinner all of the time
When it's him and I

[Pre-Chorus]
And you squeeze my hands two times, three times
And believe me, I'll love you always, always

[Chorus]

I was not living, I was just writing about it
With my head spinning
Days passing by most of the time, yeah

And believe me, I'll love you always, always (Always)

[Chorus]
All I do, the whole day through, is dream of you

Stay back, stay long, and you move on
I stress, come close, move on, please don't

[Pre-Chorus]
Hello, how are you? How you've been?
Lately I wonder how it feels to steal your kiss
Nothing much, just fine I'm doing well
And you can read between the lines but God, I fell

[Chorus]
I only told the moon, tonight up on the roof
I told her that I'm scared that all my thoughts they look like you
I only told the moon, about the way you move
I asked her to please tell me if you tell things to her too

[Verse 2]
Silence. Too loud. Say it, not now

[Pre-Chorus]
So how are you? How you've been?
Lately I wonder how it feels to taste your lips
Nothing much, just fine I'm doing well
And you can read between the lines but God, I fell

[Chorus]
I only told the moon, tonight up on the roof
I told her that I'm scared that all my thoughts they look like you
I only told the moon, about the way you move
I asked her to please tell me if you tell things to her too
That I give it all to you, I give it all to you, I give it all to you
I only told the moon

[Bridge]
Ah-ah-ah-ah
And another love song will play on the radio, you know
Ah-ah-ah-ah
Oh, and Ill wait for the moon to lean in close and say

[Chorus]
That he only told the moon, tonight up on the roof
He told me that hes scared that all his thoughts they look like you
I only told the moon, about the way you move
I asked her to please tell me if you tell this to her too

[Outro]
That I give it all to you, I give it all to you, I give it all to you
We only told the moon
We only told the moon
Only told the moon[Verse 1]
I might say sorry way too much
Unnecessarily nervous
I feel every damn thing again
The sound of your name like a cut

[Pre-Chorus]
I tried to hold the pieces inside
The tighter I held it, cut like a knife
Blood from our oath falls on your hands, not mine
I used to laugh, just like a child
I feel okay, just for a while, yeah
Then I realized

[Chorus]
All I'm left with is this scar tissue
Battle wounds after surviving you (oh)
Im left with all the bruises, excuses
The truth is: trying to restart, that's the hardest part
The scar tissue

[Post-Chorus]
Ooh, ooh, ooh
The scar tissue, ooh, ooh, ooh
That's the hardest part
The scar tissue

[Verse 2]
Secretly dangerous
The hurt that youre capable of
I couldn't see you coming if I tried
You pull the trigger and hide

[Pre-Chorus]
I tried to hold the pieces inside
The tighter I held it, cut like a knife
Blood from our oath falls on your hands, not mine
I used to laugh, just like a child
I feel okay, just for a while, yeah
Then I realized

[Chorus]
All I'm left with is this scar tissue
Battle wounds after surviving you (oh)
I'm left with all the bruises, excuses
The truth is: trying to restart, that's the hardest part
The scar tissue

[Post-Chorus]
Ooh, ooh, ooh
The scar tissue, ooh, ooh, ooh
That's the hardest part
The scar tissue

[Verse 3]
Dealing with the scar tissue
Everything you put me through, na na na yeah
Dealing with the scar tissue
Everything you put me through, na na na yeah
Dealing with the scar tissue
Everything you put me through, na na na yeah
Dealing with the scar tissue
Dealing with the scar tissue

[Bridge]
Oh, I'm not okay
But I'm getting closer to it everyday
Closer and closer til you fade away
All Im left with is the scar tissue
Yeah, that's the hardest part
The scar tissue

[Post-Bridge]
(All the scars, ooh, ooh, ooh)
The scar tissue, ooh, ooh, ooh
(Im going home, I'm trying)
That's the hardest part
The scar tissue

[Outro]
I'm going home, Im trying (na na na yeah)
I'm trying (na na na yeah)
I'm going home, I'm trying (na na na yeah)
I'm trying[Verse 1: Camila Cabello]
No, I think I'll stay in tonight
Skip the conversations and the "Oh, I'm fines"
No, I'm no stranger to surprise
This paper town has let me down too many times
Why do I even try? Give me a reason why
I thought that I could trust you, never mind
Why all the switching sides? Where do I draw the line?
I guess I'm too naive to read the signs

[Chorus: Camila Cabello & Swae Lee]
I'm just lookin' for some real friends (real friends)
All they ever do is let me down
Every time I let somebody in
Then I find out what they're all about
I'm just lookin' for some real friends (real friends)
Wonder where they're all hidin' out (hidin' out)
I'm just lookin' for some real friends (real friends)
Gotta get up out of this town

[Post-Chorus: Camila Cabello]
Oh, ohhh
Ohhh, ah

[Verse 2: Swae Lee]
Trust slow for a reason (reason)
See through the fake pretty easy (yeah!)
Stayin' down 'till the world ends (easy)
Guilt trips on the weekend (hey)
I pack more than suits in my suitcases (yeah)
All this cash, that's friendly faces
Been movin' fast, I'm racin' (wait)
Get up, you're going places (c'mon)
Every day, tryna maintain
Same old me, ain't a damn thing change (change)
Real friends screaming, "Gang, gang, gang"

[Chorus: Camila Cabello & Swae Lee]
I'm just lookin' for some real friends (real friends)
All they ever do is let me down (oh-no-no)
Every time I let somebody in (woah)
Then I find out what they're all about (all about, ooh)
I'm just lookin' for some real friends (real friends)
Wonder where they're all hidin' out (hidin' out)
I'm just lookin' for some real friends (real friends)
Gotta get up out of this town

[Post-Chorus: Camila Cabello & Swae Lee]
Real friends
Oh, ohhh
Lookin' for some real friends
Real friends
Yeah!

[Bridge: Camila Cabello & Swae Lee]
I just wanna talk about nothin'
With somebody that means something (conversation)
Spell the names of all our dreams and demons
For the times that I don't understand (why?)
Tell me what's the point of a moon like this
When I'm alone again (yeah yeah yeah)
Can I run away to somewhere beautiful
Where nobody knows my name?

[Chorus: Camila Cabello & Swae Lee]
I'm just lookin' for some real friends
All they ever do is let me down
And I let somebody in
But I find out what they're all about
I'm just lookin' for some real friends (real friends)
All they ever do is let me down
I'm just lookin' for some real friends (real friends)
Gotta get up out of this town, yeah

[Outro: Camila Cabello & Swae Lee]
Spend a fortune with my real friends
Good gas, what we breathe in (oh, ohhh)
Pop corks with some real friends
Killin' the scene, yeah (ohhh, ah)
Hangin' with my real friends
That I surround myself with (ohhh, ah)
You have to have my back (ah)
Lookin' like my real friends[Chorus]
Havana, ooh na-na
Half of my heart is in Havana, ooh-na-na
He took me back to East Atlanta, na-na-na
Oh, but my heart is in Havana
My heart is in Havana
Havana, ooh na-na

[Verse 1]
He didn't walk up with that "how you doin'?"
(When he came in the room)
He said theres a lot of girls I can do with
(But I can't without you)
I knew him forever in a minute
(That summer night in June)
And papa says he got malo in him
I didn't listen

[Pre-Chorus]
I know he's the spot (hey)
We're running out of moonlight (hey)
People say that he is hot
So here's your ticket, girl, it's a shot
And I can't make decisions with the stress
Should I say yes? (uh-huh)

[Chorus]
Havana, ooh na-na
Half of my heart is in Havana, ooh-na-na
He took me back to East Atlanta, na-na-na
Oh, but my heart is in Havana

Bibbidi-bobbiidi-boo
It seems the floor's getting colder since I laid on it
And I held hands with the car cause he was late on it
I did my liner, put on but she's on his phone fronting
(Look at him fronting, look, look at him fronting)
Cause it's 3 AM and it ain't the same
And the sign is clear when the phone don't ring
Why, oh, why
She said a dream is a wish your heart makes
And he's a sad reality

[Chorus 1]
Cinderella never asked for a prince (no)
Just a dress, there anybody like this? (no)
If the shoe won't fit then I'll walk barefoot to the moon
If you fall when the clock hits the spot then
Bibbidi-bobbiidi-boo
Instagram that just won't do
Back then I managed the crew
At twelve it's just me in my ripped skinny jeans
But I'm still a damn princess to you
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
Bibbidi-bobbiidi-boo
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
Bibbidi-bobbiidi-boo

[Verse 2]
I broke a sweat tryna catch you single blame from it
But you're not listening, oh, you want kissing
I'm not asking for your red wine
But couldn't have you hold me down

I mean is this supposed to be like a date or something?

[Chorus 2]
Cinderella never asked for a prince, (no)
Just a dress, there anybody like this? (no)
If the shoe won't fit then I'll walk barefoot to the moon
If you fall when the clock hits the spot then
Bibbidi-bobbiidi-boo
Cinderella never asked for a prince, (no)
Just a dress, there anybody like this? (no)
Us twenty first century girls need chivalry too
If you fall when the clock hits the spot then
Bibbidi-bobbiidi-boo

[Bridge]
Once upon a time there was a boy with a face divine
But he couldn't understand how to be a gentleman
And so the lady said farewell, she deserved better for real
And now he's crying alone
Cause she sassed him with this song, oh

[Chorus 3]
Cinderella never asked for a prince, (no)
Just a dress, there anybody like this? (no)
If the shoe won't fit then I'll walk barefoot to the moon
If you fall when the clock hits the spot then
If you fall when the clock hits the spot then

[Outro]
Mhm, I'm still a damn princess to you
Bibbidi-bobbiidi-boo[Verse 1]
Wise men say, only fools rush in
But I took your hand and I jumped right in
I guess everything has a consequence, oh I, I
I get mad, and put on a show
'Cause the highs are high but the lows are low
You control me more than you've ever known
But I wouldn't have it any other way

[Chorus]
Must be love
Or this wouldn't hurt so much
And I wouldn't think so much
And I could just give you up, up, oh
It must be love
Or this wouldn't hurt so much
And I wouldn't think so much
And I could just give you up, up

[Verse 2]
I fall hard, that's just how I am
And I bend and break like a rubber band
Everything gets real after 2 AM
So don't, don't, don't look at me like that
When you were the one that implied that
'Cause I'mma look at you right back
I promise that you ain't gon' like that, yeah
We fuss and we fight, forget that night
And I wouldn't have it any other way

[Chorus]
Must be love
Or this wouldn't hurt so much
And I wouldn't think so much
And I could just give you up, up, oh
It must be love
Or this wouldn't hurt so much
And I wouldn't think so much
And I could just give you up, up, oh

[Bridge]
Love, love, love
And I could just give you up
Love

[Chorus]
Must be love
Or this wouldn't hurt so much (so much)
And I wouldn't think so much
And I could just give you up, up

And "I'll stop kissing your mouth" like friends do
'Cause I can't look at you quite like friends do
Like friends do

And you don't say my name quite like friends do
And when I kiss your neck, does it feel like friends do?
So baby say it again, I dare you
If this feels like
Like friends do[Verse 1]
I woke up just to miss ya
I woke up just to check if my phone decides to whisper
You said you needed time so I made the clock move quicker
Honestly, you were my only friend
I hate to say I need ya
Look for you in everyone and all it does it feed the
Urge to call you up so I made myself delete ya
Jenny said it's the right thing to do

[Pre-Chorus]
Tell me is it;
Loud where you are dear?
There's a silence here
Where are you anymore? (oh-oh)

[Chorus]
'Cause there's a you-shaped space where your hands used to be
Baby, there's a pillowcase where you lay next to me
It's 3 AM, you know, I know, can't cure the vacancy
Oh baby, there's a you-shaped space where your hands used to be

[Interlude]

[Pre-Chorus]
Tell me is it;
Loud where you are dear?
There's a silence here
Where are you anymore?

[Chorus]
'Cause there's a you-shaped space where your hands used to be
Baby, there's a pillowcase where you lay next to me
It's 3 AM, you know, I know, can't cure the vacancy
Oh baby, there's a you-shaped space where your hands used to be

[Interlude]

[Chorus]
'Cause there's a you-shaped space where your hands used to be
Baby, there's a pillowcase where you lay next to me
It's 3 AM, you know, I know, can't cure the vacancy
Oh baby, there's a you-shaped space where your hands used to be[Verse 1]
Came across a picture of you and her online
She looks at you like she knows that youre bored out of your mind
I'm wrapped in his arms
Feeling perfectly alone
But I know there's been a mix-up
Because I wish his hands were yours

[Pre-Chorus]
So come closer, closer
Darling, I thought of a plan
Let me whisper, whisper
So that you can understand
We'll be dressed in, dressed in
All black from head to toe
Only we'll know, only we'll know

[Chorus]
I think we should trade
Cupid told me he was drunk that day
And so he shot two arrows the wrong way
I heard him say
I think we should trade
We'll tell him let's go on a double date
And meet us up at six in the cafe
We'll run away
And call it the exchange

[Verse 2]
Blink twice if it's true
But do you think about it too (you, you do)
You said you're running out with her
It tells me that you do (I know that you do)
There's beats that I've been skippin'
When my head is on your chest (you, you do)
And you know if it were us two
It'd be cardiac arrest

[Pre-Chorus]
So come closer, closer
Darling, I thought of a plan
Let me whisper, whisper
So that you can understand
We'll be dressed in, dressed in
All black from head to toe
Only we'll know, only we'll know, woah

[Chorus]
I think we should trade
Cupid told me he was drunk that day
And so he shot two arrows the wrong way
I heard him say

[Bridge]
Now that you know it's true, know it's true
There's nothing like me and you
And you've been trying to say it ain't true, but it's starving me how I look at you
I know that you know it's true, know it's true
There's nothing like me and you
And you've been trying to say it ain't true, but it's starving me how I love you
I know that you know it's true, know it's true
There's nothing like me and you
And you've been trying to say it ain't true, but it's starving me how I look at you
I know that you know
There's nothing like me and you

[Chorus]
I think we should trade
We'll tell him we'll go on a double date
And meet us up at six in the cafe
We'll run away
What do you say we run away?
We'll call it the exchange[Verse 1]
I threw a wish in the well
Don't ask me, I'll never tell
I looked to you as it fell
And now you're in my way
I trade my soul for a wish
Pennies and dimes for a kiss
I wasn't looking for this
But now you're in my way

[Pre-Chorus]
Your stare was holding
Ripped jeans, skin was showin'
Hot night, wind was blowin'
Where you think you're going, baby?

[Chorus]
Hey, I just met you, and this is crazy
But here's my number, so call me maybe
It's hard to look right at you, baby
But here's my number, so call me maybe
Hey, I just met you, and this is crazy
But here's my number, so call me maybe
And all the other boys try to chase me
But here's my number, so call me maybe

[Verse 2]
You took your time with the call
I took no time with the fall
You gave me nothing at all
But still you're in my way
I beg and borrow and steal
At first sight and it's real
I didn't know I would feel it
But it's in my way

[Pre-Chorus]
Your stare was holding
Ripped jeans, skin was showing
Hot night, wind was blowing
Where you think you're going, baby?

[Chorus]
Hey, I just met you, and this is crazy
But here's my number, so call me maybe
It's hard to look right at you, baby
But here's my number, so call me maybe
Hey, I just met you, and this is crazy
But here's my number, so call me maybe
And all the other boys try to chase me
But here's my number, so call me maybe

[Bridge]
Before you came into my life, I missed you so bad
I missed you so bad
I missed you so, so bad
Before you came into my life, I missed you so bad
And you should know that
I missed you so, so bad

[Breakdown]
It's hard to look right at you, baby
But here's my number, so call me maybe

[Chorus]
Hey, I just met you, and this is crazy
But here's my number, so call me maybe
And all the other boys try to chase me
But here's my number, so call me maybe

[Outro]
Before you came into my life, I missed you so bad
I missed you so bad
I missed you so, so bad
Before you came into my life, I missed you so bad
And you should know that
I missed you so, so bad
So call me maybe[Verse 1]
I really wanna stop, but I just got the taste for it
I feel like I could fly with the boy on the moon
So honey, hold my hand, you like making me wait for it
I feel like I could die walking up to the room, oh yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
Late night watching television
But how'd we get in this position?
It's way too soon, I know this isn't love
But I need to tell you something

[Chorus]
I really, really, really, really, really, really like you
And I want you, do you want me, do you want me too?
I really, really, really, really, really, really like you
And I want you, do you want me, do you want me too?
Oh, did I say too much?
Im so in my head when were out of touch
I really, really, really, really, really, really like you
And I want you, do you want me, do you want me too?

[Verse 2]
It's like everything you say is a sweet revelation
All I wanna do is get into your head
Yeah, we could stay alone
You and me, and this temptation
Sipping on your lips, hanging on by a thread, baby

[Pre-Chorus]
Late night watching television
But how'd we get in this position?
It's way too soon, I know this isn't love (Love)
But I need to tell you something

[Chorus]
I really, really, really, really, really, really like you
And I want you, do you want me, do you want me too?
I really, really, really, really, really, really like you
And I want you, do you want me, do you want me too?
Oh, did I say too much?
Im so in my head when were out of touch (When were out of touch!)
I really, really, really, really, really, really like you
And I want you, do you want me, do you want me too?

[Bridge]
Who gave you eyes like that?
Said you could keep them
I dont know how to act
Or if I should be leaving
Im running out of time
Going out of my mind
I need to tell you something
Yeah, I need to tell you something
Yeah!

[Chorus]
I really, really, really, really, really, really like you
And I want you, do you want me, do you want me too?
I really, really, really, really, really, really like you (Oh oh oh)
And I want you, do you want me, do you want me too?
Oh, did I say too much? (Did I say too much?)
Im so in my head when were out of touch (Im so in my head, when were out of touch)
I really, really, really, really, really, really like you
And I want you, do you want me, do you want me too? (Yeah!)

And I want you, do you want me, do you want me too? (Yeah, I need to tell you something)
I really, really, really, really, really, really like you (Oh, yeah)
And I want you, do you want me, do you want me too?[Verse 1]
I had a dream, or was it real?
We crossed the line and it was on
(We crossed the line, it was on this time)
I've been denying how I feel
You've been denying what you want
(You want from me, talk to me baby)

[Pre-Chorus]
I want some satisfaction, take me to the stars
Just like, "ahhh"
A-a-ahhh!

[Chorus]
I wanna cut through the clouds, break the ceiling
I wanna dance on the roof, you and me alone
I wanna cut to the feeling, oh yeah
I wanna cut to the feeling, oh yeah
I wanna play where you play with the angels
I wanna wake up with you all in tangles, oh
I wanna cut to the feeling, oh yeah
I wanna cut to the feeling, oh yeah

[Verse 2]
Cancel your reservations
No more hesitations, this is on
(Can't make it stop, give me all you got)
I want it all or nothing
No more in-between, now give your
(Everything to me, let's get real baby)

[Pre-Chorus]
A chemical reaction, take me in your arms
And make me, "ahhh"
A-a-ahhh!

[Chorus]
I wanna cut through the clouds, break the ceiling
I wanna dance on the roof, you and me alone
I wanna cut to the feeling, oh yeah
I wanna cut to the feeling, oh yeah
I wanna play where you play with the angels
I wanna wake up with you all in tangles, oh
I wanna cut to the feeling, oh yeah
I wanna cut to the feeling, oh yeah

[Bridge]
Take me to emotion, I want to go all the way
Show me devotion and take me all the way
Take me to emotion, I want to go all the way
Show me devotion and take me all the way
All the way, all the way, all the way
Take me all the way, a-a-ahhh!

[Chorus]
I wanna cut through the clouds, break the ceiling
I wanna dance on the roof, you and me alone
I wanna cut to the feeling, oh yeah
I wanna cut to the feeling, oh yeah
I wanna play where you play with the angels
I wanna wake up with you all in tangles, oh
I wanna cut to the feeling, oh yeah
I wanna cut to the feeling, oh yeah

[Outro]
I wanna cut through the clouds
Mmm, cut to the feeling
I wanna dance on the roof, oh oh oh, yeah
I wanna cut to the feeling, I wanna cut to the feeling
I wanna cut to the feeling, I wanna cut to the feeling[Verse 1]
You're stuck in my head
Stuck on my heart
Stuck in my body, body
I wanna go
Get outta here
I'm sick of the party, party
I'd run away
I'd run away with you, ooh

[Verse 2]
This is the part
You gotta say
All that you're feeling, feeling
Packing a bag
Leaving tonight
While everyone's sleeping, sleeping
Let's run away
I'll run away with you, ooh

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause you make me feel like
I could be driving you all night
And I'll find your lips in the streetlights
I wanna be there with you, ooh

[Chorus]
Baby, take me to the feeling
I'll be your sinner in secret
When the lights go out
Run away with me, run away with me
Baby, every single minute
I'll be your hero and win it
When the lights go out
Run away with me, run away with me

[Verse 3]
Up in the clouds
High as a kite
Over the city, city
We never sleep
We never try
When you are with me, with me
I wanna stay
I wanna stay here with you, ooh

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause you make me feel like
I could be driving you all night
And I'll find your lips in the streetlights
I wanna be there with you, ooh

[Chorus]
Baby, take me to the feeling
I'll be your sinner in secret
When the lights go out
Run away with me, run away with me
Baby, every single minute
I'll be your hero and win it
When the lights go out
Run away with me, run away with me

[Bridge]
Hold on to me, I never wanna let you go, ooh
Over the weekend, we could turn the world to gold, ooh
Hold on to me, I never wanna let you go, ooh
Over the weekend, we could turn the world to gold
Ohh, ohh

[Chorus]
Oh my baby, take me to the feeling (Take me to, take me to it)
I'll be your sinner, in secret (Oh, when the lights go)
When the lights go out
Run away with me (Just run away)
Run away with me (With me)
(Oh, yeah yeah) baby
Every single minute
I'll be your hero and win it
When the lights go out
Run away with me, run away with me

[Outro]
Run away with me, run away with me
Run away with me, run away with me[Intro: Sia]
Listen, just leave or stay... but I'm done with you tonight

[Verse 1]
"If you're gonna go then go"
She said to me on the phone
"So tired of hearin' all your boy problems
If you're gonna stay then stay
He's not gonna change anyway
So tired of hearin' all your boy problems"

[Pre-Chorus]
And I know that she's right
And I should not be offended
Yeah, I know what it looks like from the outside
I know that she's right
And I should not be offended
Yeah, I know what it looks like from the outside, from the outside

[Chorus]
Boy problems, who's got 'em?
I've got 'em too
Boy trouble, we've got double
Don't know what to do
I think I broke up with my boyfriend today and I don't really care
I've got worse problems (I broke up with my boyfriend)
I think I broke up with my boyfriend today and I don't really care
I've got worse problems (I broke up with my boyfriend, yeah)

[Verse 2]
"Carly, you got to let it go!"
She said to me on the phone
"So tired of hearin' all your boy problems
It could be the perfect day
He'll just make it rain anyway
So tired of hearin' all your boy problems"

[Pre-Chorus]
And I know that she's right
And I should not be offended
Yeah, I know what it looks like from the outside
I know that she's right
And I should not be offended
Yeah, I know what it looks like from the outside
From the outside

[Chorus]
Boy problems, who's got 'em?
I've got 'em too
Boy trouble, we've got double
Don't know what to do
I think I broke up with my boyfriend today and I don't really care
I've got worse problems (I broke up with my boyfriend)
I think I broke up with my boyfriend today and I don't really care
I've got worse problems (I broke up with my boyfriend, yeah)

[Bridge]
What's worse, losing a lover or losing your best friend?
Oh oh oh oh oh
What's worse is when you discover you're not good for each other
She's been giving, you've been taking, taking, taking

[Chorus]
Boy problems, who's got 'em?
I've got 'em too
Boy trouble, we've got double
Don't know what to do
I think I broke up with my boyfriend today and I don't really care
I've got worse problems (I broke up with my boyfriend)
I think I broke up with my boyfriend today and I don't really care
I've got worse problems (I broke up with my boyfriend, yeah)

[Outro]
Boy problems, who's got 'em?

I've got 'em too
Boy trouble, we've got double
Don't know what to do
Boy problems, who's got 'em?
I've got 'em too[Verse 1]
Be tormented by me, babe
Wonder, wonder how I do
How's the weather? Am I better?
Better now that there's no you?
Drink tequila for me, babe
Let it hit you cold and hot
Let your feelings be revealing that you can't forget me

[Pre-Chorus]
Not a flower on the wall
I am growing ten feet, ten feet tall
In your head and I won't stop
Until you forget me, get me not

[Chorus]
In your fantasy, dream about me
And all that we could do with this emotion
Fantasy, dream about me
And all that we could do with this emotion
This emotion, I feel it
This emotion, you feel it
All that we could do with this emotion

[Verse 2]
Paint a picture for me, boy
Where the sky's forever blue
Tell me there is nothing I can't have and nothing you won't do
Toss and turn without me, boy
Let it hit you cold and hot
All my kisses, say you'll miss it and you can't forget me

[Pre-Chorus]
Not a flower on the wall
I am growing ten feet, ten feet tall
In your head and I won't stop
Until you forget me, get me not

[Chorus]
In your fantasy, dream about me
And all that we could do with this emotion
Fantasy, dream about me
And all that we could do with this emotion
This emotion, I feel it
This emotion, you feel it
All that we could do with this emotion

What if I turn the lights right down?
I feel it
What if I turn the lights right down?
You feel it
You and me in the dark right now
I feel it

In your fantasy, dream about me
And all that we could do with this emotion
Fantasy, dream about me
And all that we could do with this emotion
This emotion, I feel it
This emotion, you feel it
All that we could do with this emotion[Verse 1]
I used to be in love with you
You used to be the first thing on my mind
I know Im just a friend to you
That I will never get to call you mine

[Pre-Chorus]
But I still love you, Im sorry, Im sorry, I love you
I didnt mean to say what I said
I miss you, I mean it, I tried not to feel it
But I cant get you out of my head
And I want you to miss me when Im not around you
I know that youre in town
Oh, won't you come around to the spot that we met?

[Chorus]
Im not the type of girl for you
And Im not going to pretend
That Im the type of girl you call more than a friend
And I'd break all the rules for you
Break my heart and start again
Im not the type of girl you call more than a friend

[Verse 2]
I bet she acts so perfectly
You probably eat up every word she says
And if you ever think of me
I bet Im just a flicker in your head

[Pre-Chorus]
But I still love you, Im sorry, Im sorry, I love you
I didnt mean to say what I said
I miss you, I mean it, I tried not to feel it
But I cant get you out of my head
And I want you to miss me, when Im not around you
I know that youre in town
Oh, won't you come around to the spot that we met?

Ill make time for you (Time for you)
Ill make time for you (Time for you)

I love you, Im sorry, Im sorry, I love you
I didnt mean to say what I said
I miss you, I mean it, I tried not to feel it
But I cant get you out of my head

[Chorus]
Im not the type of girl for you
And Im not going to pretend
That Im the type of girl you call more than a friend
And I'd break all the rules for you
Break my heart and start again
Im not the type of girl you call more than a friend

[Outro]
Ill make time for you (Time for you)
Ill make time for you (Time for you)
Ill make time for you (Time for you)
Ill make time for you (Time for you)[Verse 1]
If you didn't know that you were right for me
Then there's nothing I can say
Tried to call you out to spend some time to see
But somebody's in your way
Tried to let it go and say I'm over you
I'm not over you
But I'm trying

[Pre-Chorus]
Party for one
If you don't care about me
I'll just dance for myself
Back on my beat
I'll be the one
If you don't care about me
Making love to myself
Back on my beat

[Chorus]
You don't want my love
If you don't care about me
I'll just dance for myself
Back on my beat
Party for one
If you don't care about me
Making love to myself
Back on my beat
Ahh, ahh, ahh

[Verse 2]
Once upon a time, I thought you wanted me
Was there no one else to kiss? (No one else to kiss)
Was it all a dream I let myself believe?
I'm not over this (I'm not over this)
But I'm trying

[Pre-Chorus]
Party for one (Hey)
If you don't care about me
I'll just dance for myself
Back on my beat
I'll be the one
If you don't care about me

Making love to myself

Am I bad for you?
'Cause I live for the fire, and the rain, and the drama, too, boy
And it feels like you never say what you want
And it feels like I can't get through, babe
Ooh, babe

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause when I get so low, it takes me higher (Feel the love)
I'm not afraid to know my heart's desire, ooh-ah!

[Chorus]
When I party, then I party too much
When I feel it, then I feel it too much
When I'm thinking, then I'm thinking too much
When I'm drinking, then I'm drinking too much
I'll do anything to get to the rush
Now I'm dancing, and I'm dancing too much
So be careful if you're wanting this touch
'Cause if I love you, then I love you too much

[Post-Chorus]
Is this too, is this too
Is this too much?
Is this too, is this too
Is this too much?

[Verse 2]
Am I too close?
'Cause you fold into me like a heart with a beat
I know now, I know now
And did you know that I'm wild for your skin
And the dance that we're in?
So close now, so close now

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause when I get so low, it takes me higher (Feel the love)
I'm not afraid to know my heart's desire, ooh-ah!

[Chorus]
When I party, then I party too much
When I feel it, then I feel it too much
When I'm thinking, then I'm thinking too much
When I'm drinking, then I'm drinking too much
I'll do anything to get to the rush
Now I'm dancing, and I'm dancing too much
So be careful if you're wanting this touch
'Cause if I love you, then I love you too much

[Post-Chorus]
Is this too, is this too
Is this too much?
Is this too, is this too
Is this too much?

[Bridge]
A fire in rainy season
It's hard to get to know me
Are you down, d-down
I'm down, d-down
I trust the, trust the feeling
It's hard to get to know you
But I'm down, d-down
I'm down, d-down

[Chorus]
When I party, then I party too much
When I feel it, then I feel it too much
When I'm thinking, then I'm thinking too much
When I'm drinking, then I'm drinking too much
I'll do anything to get to the rush
Now I'm dancing, and I'm dancing too much
So be careful if you're wanting this touch
'Cause if I love you, then I love you too much

Is this too, is this too
Is this too much?
Is this too, is this too
Is this too much?[Intro]
1-2-3-4!
La la la la la la la
La la la la la la

[Verse 1]
Whatever happened to predictability?
The milkman, the paperboy, the evening tv?
How did I get delivered here? Somebody tell me, please
'Cause this old world is just really confusing me

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Clouds as mean as you've ever seen
Ain't a bird that knows your tune
Then a little voice inside of you whispers
"Kid, don't sell your dreams so soon!"

[Chorus]
Everywhere you look, everywhere you go
There's a heart (there's a heart), a hand to hold onto
Everywhere you look, everywhere you go
There's a face (there's a face) of somebody who needs you

[Verse 2]
Whatever happened to the good old days?
Talking to friends for hours, swore it'd never go away
Now I'm feeling a little crazy, trying to fit in with a scene
Cause how do you know where you're going, if you really don't know who you've been?

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Everybody eventually
Says that they're as lost as you
So everybody shout it together
"Hey, don't sell your dreams so soon!"

[Chorus]
Everywhere you look, everywhere you go
There's a heart (there's a heart), a hand to hold onto
Everywhere you look, everywhere you go
There's a face (there's a face) of somebody who needs you
Everywhere you look, everywhere you go
There's a heart (there's a heart), a hand to hold onto
Everywhere you look

[Bridge]
When you're lost out there and you're all alone
A light is waiting to carry you home
Everywhere you look

[Guitar Solo]

[Chorus]
Everywhere you look, everywhere you go
There's a heart (there's a heart), a hand to hold onto
Everywhere you look, everywhere you go
There's a face (there's a face) of somebody who needs you
Everywhere you look, yeah

[Outro]
When you're lost out there and you're all alone
A light is waiting to carry you home
Everywhere you look
La la la la la la la
La la la la la la[Verse 1]
Woke up this mornin', it feels like every day
I got the blues, babe, not going away
Another bad dream where you were running away
I'm forever haunted by our time
We had a moment, we had a summertime
Asked me to leave with you, but I could never decide
I've been so torn up, I've been so out of it
I'm forever haunted by our time

[Pre-Chorus]
I've been all alone, on my own
Every single night, I play
When you coming home? Coming home?
'Cause I've been rarin' for that day

[Chorus]
Julien, in your heart, yeah, you must believe
Julien, it was more than a fantasy
To the end, to the last breath that I breathe
I'll be whispering, "Julien"

[Post-Chorus]
(Ah yeah, all night, yeah, Julien, Julien)
I'll be whispering, "Julien" (Julien, Julien)
To the last breath that I breathe (Julien)

[Verse 2]
I tried another to keep me satisfied
But all your colors are still dancing in my mind
More than just lovers, I
I'm forever haunted by our time

[Pre-Chorus]
I've been all alone, on my own
Every single night, I play
When you coming home? Coming home?
'Cause I've been rarin' for that day

[Chorus]
Julien, in your heart, yeah, you must believe
Julien, it was more than a fantasy
To the end, to the last breath that I breathe
I'll be whispering, "Julien"

[Post-Chorus]
(Ah yeah, all night, yeah, Julien, Julien)
I'll be whispering, "Julien" (Julien, Julien)
To the last breath that I breathe (Julien)

[Bridge]
Julien, to the last breath that I breathe
Julien, it was more than a fantasy
To the end, to the last breath that I breathe

[Chorus]
Julien, in your heart, yeah, you must believe
Julien, it was more than a fantasy
To the end, to the last breath that I breathe (Julien)
I'll be whispering, "Julien"

[Post-Chorus]
(Ah yeah, all night, yeah, Julien, Julien)
I'll be whispering, "Julien" (Julien, Julien)
To the last breath that I breathe (Julien)
(Ah yeah, all night, yeah, Julien, Julien)
(Julien, Juli, Julien)[Verse 1]
When all the lights out (Hey), where you going?
I keep a window, for you, it's always open
I'm like a lighthouse, I'm a reminder of where you going
I'm in your head now, from every second now
Is your love growing?

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, with you (Hey), a girl could get bolder
I just wanna get a little bit closer (Ha-ah-ah)
And I'll press you to the pages of my heart
Don't go, no (Hey), the night's not over
I just wanna get a little bit closer (A little bit closer)
And I'll press you to the pages of my heart (Hey)

[Chorus]
(I want you in my room)
On the bed, on the floor
(I want you in my room)
I don't care anymore
I wanna do bad things to you
Slide on through my window
(I want you in my room)
Baby, don't you want me, too?

[Verse 2]
When no one loves you like they really mean it
I got you covered, under covers
Can you feel it?

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, with you (Hey), a girl could get bolder
I just wanna get a little bit closer (Ha-ah-ah)
And I'll press you to the pages of my heart
Don't go, no (Hey), the night's not over
I just wanna get a little bit closer (A little bit closer)
And I'll press you to the pages of my heart (Hey)

[Chorus]
(I want you in my room)
On the bed, on the floor
(I want you in my room)
I don't care anymore
I wanna do bad things to you
Slide on through my window
(I want you in my room)
Baby, don't you want me, too?

[Outro]
Baby, don't you want me, too?
On the bed, on the floor
Slide on through my window
Baby, don't you want me, too?[Verse 1]
I've got a cavern of secrets
None of them are for you
Even if you wanted to keep them
Where would you find the room?
Let down my guard tonight
I just don't care anymore
And I've told a hundred lies
But I don't wanna tell you any at all

[Pre-Chorus]
And I can not control it
The way you're making me feel
And you have got me going
Spinning in circles 'round your warm blood

[Chorus]
Warm blood feels good
I can't control it anymore
Sweet one, you should stop me there, but I keep on talking
I would throw in the towel for you, boy
'Cause you lift me up and catch me when I'm falling for you

[Verse 2]
I saw myself tonight
Caught my reflection in the mirror
My hands and heart were tied
But I was scared of almost nothing at all

[Pre-Chorus]
And I can not control it
The way you're making me feel
And you have got me going
Spinning in circles 'round your warm blood

[Chorus]
Warm blood feels good
I can't control it anymore
Sweet one, you should stop me there, but I keep on talking
I would throw in the towel for you, boy
'Cause you lift me up and catch me when I'm falling for you

[Bridge]
Warm blood, underneath my skin
Warm blood, my heart is pumping
Warm blood, underneath my skin
Warm blood, my heart is pumping

[Chorus]
Warm blood feels good
I can't control it anymore
Sweet one, you should stop me there, but I keep on talking
I would throw in the towel for you, boy
'Cause you lift me up and catch me when I'm falling for you
You catch me when I'm falling for you
You catch me when I'm falling
Warm blood feels good
I can't control it anymore
Sweet one, you should stop me there, but I keep on talking
I would throw in the towel for you, boy
'Cause you lift me up and catch me when I'm falling for you

[Bridge]
Warm blood, underneath my skin
Warm blood, my heart is pumping
Warm blood, underneath my skin
Warm blood, my heart is pumping[Verse 1]
I wanna play this for you all the time
I wanna play this for you when you're feeling used and tired
I wanna make the best so you want more
Just let me in your arms
Just let me in your arms
I'll be the magic you won't ever see
You can always rely on me to help you do what you want to do
I wanna be the best you've ever known
Just let me in your arms
Just let me in your arms

[Chorus]
Show me if you want me, if I'm all that
I will be there, I will be your friend
Show me if you want me, if I'm all that
I will be there, I will be your friend

[Verse 2]
I'll be your lighthouse when you're lost at sea
I'll keep my light on, baby
You can always come to me
I wanna be the place you call your home
Just let me in your arms
Just let me in your arms

[Chorus]
Show me if you want me, if I'm all that

When you need me I will never let you come apart
When you need me I will be your candle in the dark
When you need someone, oh, let me be the one
The only one, and the only one, and the only one

[Chorus]
Show me if you want me, if I'm all that (all that)
I will be there, I will be your friend

(Oh, show me that you care)
I will be there, I will be your friend
Just show me if you care[Verse 1]
Take me to the limit, hold me down there
You say you love me, but you wouldn't dare
You're tryna make it easy, you know that I care
You say you love me, but you wouldn't dare

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, starry eyes, blurry eyes
Feeling so intoxicated
Worried eyes, I'm open wide
Take me so up and down

[Chorus]
And if you make me feel in love, then I'll blossom for you
If you make me open up, I'll tell only the truth
When your mouth is running dry
Your head high, hold on, baby
You ain't tried no drug like me
And if you make me feel in love, then I'll blossom for you
If you make me open up, I'll tell only the truth
When your mouth is running dry
Keep head high, hold on, baby
You ain't tried no drug like me

[Verse 2]
I can see you spinning around in your head
(There's a little ghost of us)
A little history of us in there (Oh)
And now we've finally got to the safe other side
(Something's coming over us)
Why would we risk it for another try?
(Another try, come alive)

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, starry eyes, blurry eyes
Feeling so intoxicated
Worried eyes, I'm open wide
Take me so up and down

[Chorus]
And if you make me feel in love, then I'll blossom for you
If you make me open up, I'll tell only the truth
When your mouth is running dry
Your head high, hold on, baby
You ain't tried no drug like me
And if you make me feel in love, then I'll blossom for you
If you make me open up, I'll tell only the truth
When your mouth is running dry
Keep head high, hold on, baby
You ain't tried no drug like me

[Bridge]
(You ain't tried no drug like me)
Oh, starry eyes, blurry eyes
Feeling so intoxicated
Worried eyes, I'm open wide
Take me so up and down

[Chorus]
And if you make me feel in love then I'll blossom for you (All for you)
If you make me open up, I'll tell only the truth (All for you)
When your mouth is running dry

When your mouth is running dry
Keep head high, hold on, baby
You ain't tried no drug like me[Verse 1]
Waking up next to you every morning
How did we get this far? It came without a warning
And in the nighttime, you tell me your whole life
You and me get too real but all I feel is alright

[Pre-Chorus]
My heart's a secret, mmm
I think I'm coming alive, yeah
I think I'm coming alive with you
Tell me you'll keep it, mmm
I think I'm coming alive, yeah
I come alive with you

[Chorus]
Don't give it up, don't say it hurts
'Cause there's nothing like this feeling, baby
Now that I found you
I want it all
No, there's nothing like this feeling, baby
Now that I found you
Now that I found you
Now that I found you

[Verse 2]
Give me the words I want, baby, just say it
You know me way too well to keep it complicated
I don't wanna hide my love
I don't wanna waste it (I don't wanna waste it)
But I can't deny the moment when I taste it

[Pre-Chorus]
My heart's a secret, mmm
I think I'm coming alive, yeah
I think I'm coming alive with you
Tell me you'll keep it, mmm
I think I'm coming alive, yeah

No, there's nothing like this feeling, baby
Now that I found you

Thought it was impossible
It's just like a miracle
Say nothing's impossible now
Now that I found, now that I found you
Now that I found, now that I found you

Don't say it hurts (Don't say it hurts)
'Cause there's nothing like this feeling, baby

Sunlight moves upon my skin
Wake up, and I'm next to you
But I wish that I was next to him
Looks like this could be the end
Know that you'll be alright
Maybe one day we'll be friends
But you know me, and...

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm not that good at goodbyes
Sometimes it's best to just fly
Ask where we're going
Oh, I can't talk about it
Can't talk about it, 'cause...

[Chorus]
I'm just goin' to the store, to the store
I'm just goin' to the store
You might not see me anymore, anymore
I'm just goin' to the store
I'm just goin' to the store, to the store
I'm just goin' to the store
You might not see me anymore, anymore
I'm just goin' to the store

[Verse 2]
Don't cry
I can't play pretend
Wish it hadn't come to this
But you know there's some things you can't mend
But you know me, and...

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm not that good at goodbyes
Sometimes it's best to just fly
Ask where we're going
Oh, I can't talk about it
Can't talk about it, 'cause...

[Chorus]
I'm just goin' to the store, to the store
I'm just goin' to the store
You might not see me anymore, anymore

[Bridge]
Alright, I'm so alright this time
I just wanna say, "I'm sorry"
I just wanna say, "I'm sorry"
Alright, I'm so alright this time
I just wanna say, "I'm sorry"
I just wanna say, "I'm sorry"

[Breakdown]
I'm not that good at goodbyes
Sometimes it's best to just fly

[Chorus]

You might not see me anymore, anymore
I'm just goin' to the store
I'm just goin' to the store, to the store

I'm just goin' to the store[Verse 1]
Knock on the door
Leaving it open
It wasn't you
Why was I hoping?
Said it before, and I'll say it again
That I'll always be here when you need a friend

[Pre-Chorus]
I sat with you on my bedroom floor
And I couldn't move
All that we were losing
I saw you like I never did before
I never did before

[Chorus]
And I can feel you reaching through the cracks
A simple change of seasons, and you're back
All the roses in the garden fade to black, ooh-ooh
Yeah, I can feel you reaching through the cracks
A simple change of heart and you attack
All the roses in the garden fade to black, ooh-ooh
I won't take you back

[Verse 2]
Cat got your tongue
It's been forever
Have you been good?
Have you been better?
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
That I'll always be here if you need a friend

[Pre-Chorus]
I sat with you on my bedroom floor
And I couldn't move
All that we were losing
I saw you like I never did before
I never did before

[Chorus]
And I can feel you reaching through the cracks
A simple change of seasons and you're back
All the roses in the garden fade to black, ooh-ooh
Yeah, I can feel you reaching through the cracks
A simple change of heart and you attack
All the roses in the garden fade to black, ooh-ooh
I won't take it back

[Bridge]
Drunk on cigarettes
Last year's silhouettes
Dancing in the dark
Love made in the park
Big white blossom tree
Baby, cover me
Hold me, left to blow
Please don't let me go
Please don't let me go

[Chorus]
And I can feel you reaching through the cracks
A simple change of seasons and you're back
All the roses in the garden fade to black, ooh-ooh
Yeah, I can feel you reaching through the cracks
A simple change of heart and you attack
All the roses in the garden fade to black, ooh-ooh
I won't take it back

[Outro]
Drunk on cigarettes
Last year's silhouettes
I won't take it back
Dancing in the dark
I won't take it back
Love made in the park
Big white blossom tree
I won't take it back
Baby, cover me
Hold me, left to blow
Please don't let me go[Verse 1]
Worlds fly by
Drove by your place, and stopped again tonight
I know I said that I'm too scared to try
But I still think about you, think about you
I can't lie
I like the feeling how you make me shy
I'll share my secrets, and I will not hide
I know that one could be two, one could be two

[Chorus]
Gimmie love
Gimmie love, gimmie love, gimmie love, gimmie love
Gimmie touch
'Cause I want what I want, do you think that I want too much?
Gimmie love, gimmie love, gimmie love, gimmie love
Fall into me and then
Gimmie love
Gimmie love, gimmie love, gimmie love, gimmie love
Gimmie please
'Cause I want what I want, but with you it's what I need
Gimmie love, gimmie love, gimmie love, gimmie love
Gimmie love, gimmie love, gimmie love, gimmie love

[Verse 2]
Eyes so bright
You've got a hold of me the whole damn night
I toss and turn, but still I can't sleep right
I should've asked you to stay, begged you to stay
But when I get right next to you
I hear this heartbeat break in two
I feel the earthquake in the room and so I pray
Fall into me and then

[Chorus]
Gimmie love
Gimmie love, gimmie love, gimmie love, gimmie love
Gimmie touch
'Cause I want what I want, do you think that I want too much?
Gimmie love, gimmie love, gimmie love, gimmie love
Fall into me and then
Gimmie love
Gimmie love, gimmie love, gimmie love, gimmie love
Gimmie please

Wanna feel like this forever, forever (ooh)

And I never thought I'd ever say forever

Gimmie love, gimmie love, gimmie love, gimmie love
Gimmie touch
'Cause I want what I want, do you think that I want too much?
Gimmie love, gimmie love, gimmie love, gimmie love

Gimmie love, gimmie love, gimmie love, gimmie love
Gimmie please
'Cause I want what I want, but with you it's what I need
Gimmie love, gimmie love, gimmie love, gimmie love
Gimmie love, gimmie love, gimmie love, gimmie love[Verse 1]
I remember being naked
We were young freaks just fresh to LA
Never cared about the fake kids
We would write and sing and wear whatever

[Pre-Chorus 1]
But money makes your whole world spin
'Til everything is dizzying
And suddenly...

[Chorus]
Planes, I'm hopping
Cards, I'm dropping
No shop can fill me up
There's a little black hole in my golden cup, so
You pour, and I'll say stop
Planes, I'm hopping
Cards, I'm dropping
No shop can fill me up
There's a little black hole in my golden cup, so
You pour, and I'll say stop, so
Take me into your arms again
Shake me from L.A. hallucinations

[Verse 2]
Haven't seen the boy in ages
Used to stay up all night he and I
Filling up each other's pages
But the teeth come out when the camera flashes

[Pre-Chorus 2]
We said we'd always be the same
But we lost each other in the game
'Cause suddenly...

[Chorus]
Planes, I'm hopping
Cards, I'm dropping
No shop can fill me up
There's a little black hole in my golden cup, so
You pour, and I'll say stop
Planes, I'm hopping
Cards, I'm dropping
No shop can fill me up
There's a little black hole in my golden cup, so
You pour, and I'll say stop, so
Take me into your arms again
Shake me from L.A. hallucinations

[Bridge]
BuzzFeed buzzards and TMZ crows
What can I say that you don't already know?
BuzzFeed buzzards and TMZ crows
If I just lie here, then will you let me go?

[Chorus]
Planes, I'm hopping
Cards, I'm dropping
No shop can fill me up
There's a little black hole in my golden cup, so
You pour, and I'll say stop
Planes, I'm hopping
Cards, I'm dropping
No shop can fill me up
There's a little black hole in my golden cup, so
You pour, and I'll say stop, so
Take me into your arms again
Shake me from L.A. hallucinations

[Chorus + (Bridge)]
Take me into your arms again
(BuzzFeed buzzards and TMZ crows
What can I say that you don't already know?)
And shake me from L.A. hallucinations
(BuzzFeed buzzards and TMZ crows
If I just lie here, will you let me go?)
Take me into your arms again
(BuzzFeed buzzards and TMZ crows
What can I say that you don't already know?)
And shake me from L.A. hallucinations[Verse 1]
You're king of the castle
Whenever you're here, you know it feels right
Don't need to worry
Don't need a moon, I've got your spotlight

[Pre-Chorus]
I want you to
Do you want to?
I want you to stay tonight
I want you to say "I want you too"

[Chorus]
He never wants to strip down to his feelings
He never wants to kiss and close his eyes
He never wants to cry-y-y, cry-y-y
I never really know when he'll be leaving
And even with hello I hear goodbye
He always makes me cry-y-y, cry-y-y

[Verse 2]
Wake up without you
Flood in my room, I see your headlights
And you got your reasons
You've got a way that makes it alright

[Pre-Chorus]
I want you to
Do you want to?
I want you to stay tonight
I want you to say "I want you too"

[Chorus]
He never wants to strip down to his feelings
He never wants to kiss and close his eyes
He never wants to cry-y-y, cry-y-y
I never really know when he'll be leaving
And even with hello I hear goodbye
He always makes me cry-y-y, cry-y-y

[Bridge]
Wake up without you
Wake up without you
Wake up without you
I wake up without you, boy
Cry-y-y, cry-y-y
Wake up without you
Wake up without you
Wake up without you
I wake up without you, boy
Cry-y-y, cry-y-y

[Breakdown]
You're king of the castle
Whenever you're here, you know it feels right
Don't need to worry

[Chorus]
He never wants to strip down to his feelings
He never wants to kiss and close his eyes
He never wants to cry-y-y, cry-y-y
I never really know when he'll be leaving
And even with hello I hear goodbye
He always makes me cry-y-y, cry-y-y
Cry-y-y[Verse 1]
You and me
We been hanging around for the longest time
I know when you're down
Know what you need to get you high
Top down
Like the wind through your hair on a summer's night
Outside
All of your fears, leaving them behind

[Pre-Chorus]
Here I come now
Baby, I'm speeding and red lights, I'll run

[Verse 2]
Your eyes wide
Like you never seen the ocean, never seen the tides
No hope
Now you're seeing things that you'd lost sight of
Taking off
Got your hands in the air, and you're feeling alright
Gold mines glisten on the skin for you and I

[Pre-Chorus]
Here I come now
Baby, I'm speeding and red lights, I'll run
What I got, you need it
And I'll run to your side when your heart is bleeding

I was lost
Alone, and searchin'
For someone who understands me for who I really am
Didn't know that I was hurtin'
'Til you lift me up inside
Finally opened up my eyes, oh

[Pre-Chorus]
If you wanna know what I'm thinkin'
Ever since you came, I'm livin'
On top of the world, I can't deny
Every one of my fears has vanished
And I don't know how you managed
To wake me up and come alive

[Chorus]
You take me higher than the rest (hey)
Oh, everybody else is second best (oh-oh-oh-oh)
You pulled a gem out of a mess
I was so cynical before, I must confess
Oh, you got me hi-i-igh (hey) hi-i-igh (hey), hi-i-igher
Oh, you got me hi-i-igh (hey), hi-i-igh (hey), hi-i-igher

[Verse 2]
Took some time
A few mistakes, but
You quite didn't show me how
Never let me hit the ground
All the love was hesitating
But ever since you came around
I feel more than safe and sound, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
If you wanna know what I'm thinkin'
Ever since you came, I'm livin'
On top of the world, I can't deny
Every one of my fears has vanished
And I don't know how you managed
To wake me up and come alive

[Chorus]
You take me higher than the rest (hey)
Oh, everybody else is second best (oh-oh-oh-oh)

He's strong, not one to settle down
You know hes that guy
Electric, those lips can wear me out
Wild thing he's all mine

[Pre-Chorus]
It's crazy, but when he cant sleep, I understand
Like pressure points, my love can ease him in my hand
'Cause (He needs me)

[Chorus]
He needs me, he needs me
He needs me, he needs me
He needs me, he needs me
(I got everything he needs)

[Verse 2]
Soft rain (Soft rain), we roll the windows down
Sweat disco all night
It's clear (It's clear), we'd like to fool around
His hands reach for mine

[Pre-Chorus 2]
I know it's tough, baby, keep both eyes on the road
Pull right, a burnt-out streetlight, only halfway home
(He needs me)

[Chorus]
He needs me, he needs me
He needs me, he needs me
He needs me, he needs me
(I got everything he needs)
(He needs me)
He needs me, he needs me
He needs me, he needs me
He needs me, he needs me
(I got everything he needs)

[Post-Chorus]
Could never give him enough
Enough of my love, enough of my love
Enough of my
I could never give him enough
Enough of my love (He needs me)
Could never give him enough
Enough of my love, enough of my love
Enough of my
I could never give him enough
Enough of my love (He needs me)

You know, not just physically
Emotionally, spiritually, intellectually, sexually
All the ways

Could never give him enough
Enough of my love, enough of my love
Enough of my
I could never give him enough
Enough of my love (He needs me)
Could never give him enough
Enough of my love, enough of my love
Enough of my
I could never give him enough
Enough of my love (He needs me)[Verse 1]
I fight, I fight
All my feelings for you all night, all night
Don't stare, don't stare
I've got feelings for you I hide, I hide

[Pre-Chorus]
But I'll only go so far
I don't have the energy
To risk a broken heart
When you're already killing me

[Chorus]
But if there's something between you and me
Baby, I have no time for it
I'm happy not knowing
And please don't stir it up
I'm sure it's nothing but some heartburn, baby
And I'm happy not knowing

[Verse 2]
All our friends that I know
They've been trying to set us up together (Up together)
I lie, I lie
I say somebody else would suit you better (Suit you better)

[Pre-Chorus]
But I'll only go so far
I don't have the energy
To risk a broken heart
When you're already killing me

[Chorus]
But if there's something between you and me
Baby, I have no time for it
I'm happy not knowing
And please don't stir it up
I'm sure it's nothing but some heartburn, baby
And I'm happy not knowing

[Bridge]
I turn your love away 'cause I want to sleep at night
It's just like my broken heart is my alibi
I'm afraid, afraid, afraid, afraid of knowing
What I'm knowing, what I'm knowing
I'm happy not knowing

[Chorus]
But if there's something between you and me
Baby, I have no time for it
I'm happy not knowing
And please don't stir it up
I'm sure it's nothing but some heartburn, baby
And I'm happy not knowing

[Outro]
Where this goes
How this goes (Happy not)
If this goes (I'm happy not)
Well, I'm happy not knowing
Where this goes
How this goes (Happy not)
If this goes (I'm happy not)
Well, I'm happy not knowing[Verse 1]
I was never one to want to
Put my trust in someone else completely
And I was always one to want to up and run
When someone said they needed me

[Pre-Chorus]
But you...
You could be the one
Yeah, you could be the one

[Chorus]
Baby, let's go get lost
I like that you're driving slow
Keeping my fingers crossed
That maybe you'll take the long way home
Let's get lost
I don't wanna let you go
Keeping my fingers crossed
That maybe you'll take the long way home
Baby, let's take the long way home

[Verse 2]
I was always shy and careful
I was sure that you would never look at me
Never wanted to discourage
Everything your eyes encouraged silently

[Pre-Chorus]
But you...
You could be the one
Yeah, you could be the one

[Chorus]
Baby, let's go get lost
I like that you're driving slow
Keeping my fingers crossed
That maybe you'll take the long way home
Let's get lost
I don't wanna let you go
Keeping my fingers crossed
That maybe you'll take the long way home
Baby, let's take the long way home
Baby, let's take the long way home

[Bridge]
Let's get lost (let's get lost)
You wanna get lost? (You wanna get lost?)
Let's get lost (let's get lost)
I wanna get lost

[Chorus]
Baby, let's go get lost
I like that you're driving slow
Keeping my fingers crossed
That maybe you'll take the long way home
Let's get lost
I don't wanna let you go
Keeping my fingers crossed
That maybe you'll take the long way home
Baby, let's take the long way home
Baby, let's take the long way home
Baby, let's take the long way home[Verse 1]
Don't tell me this is how it ends
I burn with fever that I caught from you
My breath was lost when you said "friends"
Well, that could work but I'm still hot for you

[Pre-Chorus]
So I stole your bike and I rode all night
But I'm so damn scared you don't even care

[Chorus]
You wanna break my heart, alright
I caught your fever, I'll be feeling it forever
You want a brand new start, alright
I caught your fever, I'll be feeling it forever

[Verse 2]
I've still been sleeping at my friend's
Dropped off your helmet and lock for me
I wrote some things I didn't send
Three words to say that meant a lot to me

[Pre-Chorus]
So I rode your bike to your house last night
And I'm so damn scared 'cause your car's not there

[Chorus]
You wanna break my heart, alright
I caught your fever, I'll be feeling it forever
You want a brand new start, alright
I caught your fever, I'll be feeling it forever

[Refrain]
And my lights stay up, but your city sleeps
It's a different world when you're not here with me
Go on and break my heart tonight
I caught your fever, I'll be feeling it forever

[Bridge]
Don't break my heart tonight
Don't break my heart tonight
Don't break my heart tonight
Don't break my heart tonight

[Chorus]
You wanna break my heart, alright
I caught your fever, I'll be feeling it forever
You want a brand new start, alright
I caught your fever, I'll be feeling it forever

[Refrain]
And my lights stay up, but your city sleeps
It's a different world when you're not here with me
Go on and break my heart tonight
I caught your fever, I'll be feeling it forever[Chorus]
I didn't just come here to dance
If you know what I mean
Do you know what I mean?
If you'd just give me a chance
You'd see what I see
Do you see what I see?

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 1]
It's your fault
Baby boy, cause you're the one that sparked this
Shine a light
With your eyes onto me in the darkness

[Pre-Chorus]
Hey, Joe's calling me over
Tino is calling me over
I only came here for you
It's you, boy, you in the corner
Something is taking me over
I only came here for you

[Chorus]
I didn't just come here to dance
If you know what I mean
Do you know what I mean?
If you just give me a chance
You'd see what I see
You'd see what I see
I didn't just come here to dance
If you know what I mean
Do you know what I mean?
If you just give me a chance
You'd see what I see

Baby, I...
I'm not going anywhere without you
Walk me home
Cause I like every single thing about you

It's you, boy, you in the corner
Something is taking me over
I only came here for you

(I give up, I give up
I give up, I give up)

[Verse 1]
I've been testing out the waters
I don't think I can swim, love
With the way you rock me 'round
And I feel it, more than just desire
I don't think I can breathe
With the way you let me down

[Pre-Chorus]
God, you make me so tired
Isn't this the vision that you wanted?
(Isn't this the vision that you wanted?)
Guess I'll never understand you now
Love is more than telling me you want it
(Love is more than telling me you)

[Chorus]
I don't need the words
I want the sound, sound, sound, sound, sound
(Sound, sound, sound, sound, sound)
I don't need the words
I want the sound, sound, sound, sound, sound
(Sound, sound, sound, sound, sound)
I don't need the words, I want the

[Verse 2]
Fool's gold landed on my shoulder
In the weight of your hand
But you know the answer's no (Know the answer's no)
And you know I'm a liar
Oh, the night's my weakness
I believe every word
'Cause your lips are waterfalls

[Pre-Chorus]
God, you make me so tired
Isn't this the vision that you wanted?
(Isn't this the vision that you wanted?)
Guess I'll never understand you now
Love is more than telling me you want it
(Love is more than telling me you)

[Chorus]
I don't need the words
I want the sound, sound, sound, sound, sound
(Sound, sound, sound, sound, sound)
I don't need the words
I want the sound, sound, sound, sound, sound
(Sound, sound, sound, sound, sound)

[Bridge]
I'm for you now, I feel my fortune tell me
I'm the only one, the only one
I'm for you now (Is it desire?), it's sweet until it's over
I'm the only one (Is it desire?), the only one

[Pre-Chorus]
God, you make me so tired
Isn't this the vision that you wanted?
(Isn't this the vision that you wanted?)
Guess I'll never understand you now
Love is more than telling me you want it
(Love is more than telling me you)

I don't need the words
I want the sound, sound, sound, sound, sound

Now you're in love, I can see you sold out
Where was I, pic-picture, cut my eyes out
"Hes so hypnotizing," said every girl you ever met
When I lose, when I lose, I hold out

[Chorus]
You're my baby
Come to bed, I'll be your girl
Living for you
Oh, but youre living for her
I go crazy, see red when she's touching you now
You're my baby
Come to bed, I'll be your girl

[Verse 2]
Turn me on, I'm jealous of that night watch
I'm the voyeur searching through my laptop
It's so truth defying, everything you ever said
Right or wrong, right or wrong, I won't stop

[Chorus]
Youre my baby
Come to bed, Ill be your girl
Living for you
Oh, but you're living for her
I go crazy, see red when shes touching you now
You're my baby
Come to bed, I'll be your girl

[Post-Chorus]
(Ah) I'll be your girl
(Ah) Ill be your girl
(Ah) I'll be your girl
(Ah) Come to bed, I'll be your girl

[Bridge]
Standing at your door, calling out your name
Find me in the dark, find me here again
I got nothing left, make a little protest
Banging on your door, calling out your name
Find me in your heart, find me here again
I got nothing left, make a little protest

[Chorus]
You're my baby
Come to bed, I'll be your girl
Living for you
Oh, but you're living for her
I go crazy, see red when she's touching you, now
You're my baby
Come to bed, I'll be your girl

[Outro]
(Ah) All I mean is I'm going out of breath
(Ah) For the way that I feel when you hold me like that
(Ah) All I pray is I'm getting over it
(Ah) I'd trade places today if you'd love me like that
(Ah, ah)
(Ah, ah)[Verse 1]
What if we could go back?
We could take the words back
You could take my love back
And brush my hair behind my ear
I don't know what you wanted
I tried to be so perfect
I thought that it was worth it
To let myself just disappear

[Pre-Chorus]
You come to me in dreams at night
(You come to me in dreams at night)
I wake up and I see the light

[Chorus]
Sometimes I wish that I could change
But not for me, for you
So we could be together forever
But I know, I know that I won't change for you
'Cause where were you for me when I needed someone?
When I needed someone
When I needed you, hey
When I needed you, hey

[Verse 2]
Once upon a time, I thought you were the hero
I waited for you all night
I closed my eyes and slept for years
You kissed me like a sunrise
My feet up to my forehead
I felt it like a goodbye
I'm not myself

[Chorus]
Sometimes I wish that I could change
But not for me, for you
So we could be together forever
But I know, I know that I won't change for you
'Cause where were you for me when I needed someone?
When I needed someone
When I needed you, hey
When I needed you, hey

[Interlude]
You come to me in dreams at night
You come to me in dreams at night

[Bridge]
I don't want to work it out
I'm not going to work it out
I don't want to work it out
No, I'm not going to, still...

[Chorus]
Sometimes I wish that I could change
But not for me, for you
So we could be together forever
But I know, I know that I won't change for you
'Cause where were you for me
When I needed someone when I needed someone?
When I needed, hey
When I needed, hey
When I needed you, hey
When I needed you, hey
When I needed you, hey
Hey, when I needed you...[Verse 1]
The world is going crazy
And it feels like I just don't know who to trust sometimes
Something's coming over me, I need to get a hold of you now
We're getting good at lying
No one's saying what's keeping us all awake at night
Something's coming over me, I need to get a hold of you now

[Pre-Chorus]
Standing here with you tonight, how do we turn on the light?
I've got the feeling that the writing's on the wall
And I'm so used to the lie, and you're so down to deny
I've got the feeling you're the right thing after all

[Chorus]
I go everyday without it
All I want is real, real love
And I've been feeling weak without it
Only want a real, real love
I'm not even scared about it
All I want is real, real love
But I don't know a thing about it
All I want is real, real love

[Post-Chorus]
Real, real, real love
Real, real, real love
Real, real, real love

[Verse 2]
All the chaos falling 'round
I watch it like a movie that has come to life
Something kind of numb about the way I keep on drowning it out
Danger, I feel danger
And I cannot find the breath to scream the words out right
Every thought is paralyzing, need to find a way to you now

[Pre-Chorus]
Standing here with you tonight, how do we turn on the light?
I've got the feeling that the writing's on the wall
And I'm so used to the lie, you're so down to deny
I've got the feeling you're the right thing after all

[Chorus]
I go everyday without it
All I want is real, real love
And I've been feeling weak without it
Only want a real, real love
I'm not even scared about it
All I want is real, real love
But I don't know a thing about it
All I want is real, real love

[Post-Chorus]
Real, real, real love
Real, real, real love
Real, real, real love

[Outro]
I go everyday without it
All I want is real, real love
(Real, real, real love)
And I've been feeling weak without it
Only want a real, real love
(Real, real, real love)
I'm not even scared about it
All I want is real, real love
But I don't know a thing about it
All I want is real, real love[Verse 1]
I never thought about you
You never thought about us
Yeah, it came out of the blue
And I was just dreaming
It took a night of insane
To feel the need for your touch
And I could never explain
How I was just dreaming

[Pre-Chorus]
Ooh, ooh-ooh
Never guess what came after
Ooh, ooh-ooh
I fell

[Chorus]
Automatically in love
Right away, baby, it's a real rollercoaster
When the wind goes the other way
But you and me, right away, baby
We were automatically in love (In love)
Right away, right away, baby
Just a girl undercover and a boy with the getaway
You and me, right away, baby
We were automatically in love (In love)

[Verse 2]
It's not the fear that you trust
It's not the voice in your head
We got the chemical rush
And now we're just dreaming
And we could wait for the proof
A little time to adjust
But every morning with you
I wake up just dreaming

[Pre-Chorus]
Ooh, ooh-ooh
Never guess what came after
Ooh, ooh-ooh
I fell

[Chorus]
Automatically in love
Right away, baby, it's a real rollercoaster
When the wind goes the other way
But you and me, right away, baby
We were automatically in love (In love)
Right away, right away, baby
Just a girl undercover and a boy with the getaway
You and me, right away, baby
We were automatically in love (In love)

[Post-Chorus]
In love, in love
Mmm, la-da-da-da-da, da-da

[Bridge]
Love's so fast, I can't go slow
Hold me back, baby boy, oh, hold me close
Love's so real, I can't go slow
Can't imagine, right away, I feel it so

[Chorus]
Automatically in love
Right away, baby, it's a real rollercoaster
When the wind goes the other way
But you and me, right away, baby
We were automatically in love (In love)
Right away, right away, baby
Just a girl undercover and a boy with the getaway
You and me, right away, baby
We were automatically in love (In love)

[Outro]
Mmm, mmm
Hmm, hmm
Automatically[Verse 1]
I wanna smash your fears
And get drunken off your tears
Don't you share your smile with anyone else but me
I wanna touch your heart
I wanna crush it in my hands
Make you plead and cry, as you give up all the lies

[Refrain]
We're not lovers, but more than friends
Put a flame to every single word you ever said
No more crying to get me through
I'll keep dancing 'til the morning with somebody new
Tonight, I'm getting over you

[Chorus]
Tonight, I'm getting over you
Tonight, I'm getting over you
Tonight, I'm getting over you
Over you, over you

[Verse 2]
Stuck in a real bad dream
And man, it feels so new to me
Should be in your arms, but I'm begging at your feet
It's been a real hard night and I just hold my pillow tight
It won't love me back, no, it's not you and I

[Refrain]
We're not lovers, but more than friends
Put a flame to every single word you ever said
No more crying to get me through (Get me through)
I'll keep dancing 'til the morning with somebody new
Tonight, I'm getting over you

[Chorus]
Tonight, I'm getting over you
Tonight, I'm getting over you
Tonight, I'm getting over you
Over you, over you
Tonight, I'm getting over you
Tonight, I'm getting over you
Tonight, I'm getting over you
Over you, over you

[Refrain]
We're not lovers, but more than friends
Put a flame to every single word you ever said
No more crying to get me through
I'll keep dancing 'til the morning with somebody new
Tonight, I'm getting over you[Verse 1]
Truth is I never thought of us together
You're just a friend of mine
We should know better, this can't last forever
But kiss me one more time

[Pre-Chorus]
Romance is fine
Pour me some wine
Tell me it's just for the fun of it
Thoughts in your eyes
Hard to deny, but
I don't want love, don't want none of it

[Chorus]
If you want to, you can stay the night
I don't want to be the one, the one
If you want to, you can hold me tight
I don't want to be the one, the one

[Post-Chorus]
It's too much pressure
It's too much pressure
It's too much pressure
I don't want to be the one, the one

[Verse 2]
While cookin' dinner, I'd wear your socks and slippers
It's been a long, long day
It's just so easy
Love the way you read me
I never have to say

[Pre-Chorus]
Romance is fine
Pour me some wine
Tell me it's just for the fun of it
Thoughts in your eyes
Hard to deny but
I don't want love, don't want none of it

[Chorus]
If you want to, you can stay the night
I don't want to be the one, the one
If you want to, you can hold me tight
I don't want to be the one, the one

[Post-Chorus]
It's too much pressure
It's too much pressure
It's too much pressure
I don't want to be the one, the one

[Bridge]
Don't fall in love, fall in love, fall in love, fall in love
Don't fall in love, fall in love, fall in love, fall in love
Don't fall in love, fall in love, fall in love, fall in love
Don't fall in love, fall in love, fall in love, fall in love

[Chorus]
If you want to, you can stay the night
I don't want to be the one, the one
If you want to, you can hold me tight
I don't want to be the one, the one

[Post-Chorus]
It's too much pressure
It's too much pressure
It's too much pressure
I don't want to be the one, the one[Verse 1]
Hold on now
This is getting kinda serious
This is getting kinda out of control
Out of control
Slow down now
Breathing heavy, when it's just a kiss
This is getting kinda out of my hands
Out of my hands

[Pre-Chorus]
Please don't go, look real close
Eyes that show kaleidoscopes

[Chorus]
When I'm close to you
We blend into my favourite colour
I'm bright baby blue falling into you
Falling for each other
When I'm close to you
We blend into my favourite colour
I'm bright baby blue falling into you
Falling for each other

[Verse 2]
Should I stay?
Making love until the morning light
Making out like it's the end of the world
And I really wanna get it right
But it's getting hard to slow down
Got me feeling like it's real for sure
This is getting kinda out of my head
I'm out of my head

[Chorus]
When I'm close to you
We blend into my favourite colour
I'm bright baby blue falling into you
Falling for each other
When I'm close to you
We blend into my favourite colour
I'm bright baby blue falling into you
Falling for each other

[Bridge]
Paint me up, me up, me up
You're my favourite colour
Paint me up, me up, me up
You're my favourite colour
Paint me up, me up, me up
You're my favourite colour
Paint me up, me up, me up

[Pre-Chorus]
Please don't go, look real close

Eyes that show kaleidoscopes

When I'm close to you
We blend into my favourite colour
I'm bright baby blue falling into you
Falling for each other
When I'm close to you
We blend into my favourite colour
I'm bright baby blue falling into you
Falling for each other

Ain't trying to be mean but, I am the queen, yuh
Ain't fuckin' with no fuck boys!

Pretty gang, Rich Gang, Young Money..Nicki Minaj..I see you Carly Let's get it[Verse 1: Carly Rae Jepsen]
Feels good waking up in your way
My heart needed a holiday
I bet we can make things slide into Monday
I've been living with no regrets
Love was just a night at best
Two step, making the weekend slide into something

[Pre-Chorus: Carly Rae Jepsen]
One more night with you always turns to two
I can't help it 'cause it feels right when it feels right

[Chorus: Carly Rae Jepsen & Asa Taccone]
'Cause it feels like I've never loved
Now I got ya, and I only think of you
'Cause it feels like I've never loved
Now I'd do, boy, anything to step with you

[Verse 2: Carly Rae Jepsen]
True fact
Baby, I love you back, don't ask
Nothing I want to say
We know timing isn't right (Maybe one day)
'Til then, steal me a free weekend
You're my complicated friend
I'm just keeping the dream alive
But I must say

[Pre-Chorus: Carly Rae Jepsen]
One more night with you always turns to two
I can't help it 'cause it feels right, when it feels right

Feels like I've been wasting time
Look at all the things I've left behind
You're the one to change my mind
'Cause it feels right when it feels right
I don't know a thing I've done
Livin' all my life with no damn one
You're the one to change my mind
'Cause it feels right, when it feels right

Hello, I know it's been a while
I wonder where you are
And if you think of me sometimes
Cause you're always on my mind
You know I had it rough trying to forget you
But the more that I look around, the more I realize
You're all I'm looking for

[Chorus: Carly Rae Jepsen]
What makes you so beautiful
Is you don't know how beautiful you are, to me
You're not tryna be perfect
Nobody's perfect, but you are, to me
It's how you take my breath away
Feel the words that I don't say
I wish somehow I could say them now
Oh, I could say them now, yeah

[Verse 2: Justin Bieber]
Just friends, the beginning or the end
How do we make sense, when we're on our own?
It's like you're the other half of me
I feel incomplete, yeah, should have known
Nothing in the world compares
To the feelings that we share, so not fair

[Chorus: Justin Bieber]
What makes you so beautiful
Is you don't know how beautiful you are, to me
You're not tryna be perfect
Nobody's perfect, but you are, to me
You try to take my breath away
Feel the words that I don't say
I wish somehow
I could say them now, oh

[Bridge: Carly Rae Jepsen & Justin Bieber]
It's not you, blame it all on me, I was running from myself
Cause I couldn't tell how deep that we, we were gonna be
I was scared, it's destiny, but it hurts like hell
Hope it's not too late, just a twist of fate, yeah

[Chorus: Carly Rae Jepsen & Justin Bieber]
What makes you so beautiful
Is you don't know how beautiful you are, to me
You're not tryna be perfect
Nobody's perfect, but you are, to me
It's how you take my breath away
Feel the words that I don't say
I wish somehow I could say them now
Oh, I could say them now, mmm[Verse 1]
We put everything away
California wasn't made for you
Hate the traffic in LA
I drove through it all to get to you

[Pre-Chorus]
Took a million miles to feel the final separation
Don't you tell me now you know what you need
I need to find a love to love me with no hesitation
Don't you tell me now you're ready for me

[Chorus]
My baby, my baby
You always got the right words at the wrong time
This time, it's heartbreaking
You always got the right words at the wrong time
For me, for me
You always got the right words at the wrong time
For me, for me
You always got the right words at the wrong

[Verse 2]
I don't wanna see your face
I'm afraid I couldn't wait for you
I'm afraid that I would break
Only want me when I'm leaving you

[Pre-Chorus]
Took a million miles to feel the final separation
Don't you tell me now you know what you need
I need to find a love to love me with no hesitation
Don't you tell me now you're ready for me

[Chorus]
My baby, my baby
You always got the right words at the wrong time
This time, it's heartbreaking
You always got the right words at the wrong time
For me, for me
You always got the right words at the wrong time
For me, for me
You always got the right words at the wrong time

[Bridge]
Baby boy, you've always got the right words
But you always say them at the wrong time
(It's getting late, I gotta say now)
Baby boy, you've always got the right words
(That you should go, yeah, you should go home)
But you always say them at the wrong time
(It's getting late)

[Chorus]
My baby (It's getting late)
My baby (And you should go, and you should go)
You always got the right words at the wrong time
(It's getting late)
This time, it's heartbreaking (It's getting late now)
(And you should go, and you should go)
You always got the right words at the wrong time
(And you should go, you should go)
For me, for me
(And you should go, you should go)
You always got the right words at the wrong time
(And you should go, you should go)
For me, for me
('Cause) You always got the right words at the wrong time[Intro]
Payback is a bad bitch

Now, I'm out here lookin' like revenge
Feelin' like a ten, the best I've ever been

Feelin' inspired 'cause the tables have turned
Yeah, I'm on fire and I know that it burns

[Verse 2]
Baby, fineness is the way to kill
Tell me how it feel, bet it's such a bitter pill
And yeah I know, you thought you had bigger, better things
Bet right now this stings (Wait a minute)
'Cause the grass is greener under me
Bright as Technicolor, I can tell that you can see
And yeah, I know how bad it must hurt to see me like this
But it gets worse (Wait a minute)

[Pre-Chorus]
Now, payback is a bad bitch
And baby, I'm the baddest

If you talk, if you talk that talk, baby
Better walk, better walk that walk, baby

[Outro]
Payback is a bad bitch
And baby, I'm the baddest
I'm the baddest, I'm the baddest[Verse 1]
I got no excuses for all of these goodbyes
Call me when it's over 'cause I'm dying inside
Wake me when the shakes are gone
And the cold sweats disappear
Call me when it's over and myself has reappeared

[Pre-Chorus]
I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know why
I do it every, every, every time
It's only when I'm lonely
Sometimes I just wanna cave and I don't wanna fight
I try and I try and I try and I try and I try
Just hold me, I'm lonely

[Chorus]
Momma, I'm so sorry, I'm not sober anymore
And daddy, please forgive me for the drinks spilled on the floor
To the ones who never left me, we've been down this road before
I'm so sorry, I'm not sober anymore

[Verse 2]
I'm sorry to my future love for the man that left my bed
For making love the way I saved for you inside my head
And I'm sorry for the fans I lost who watched me fall again
I wanna be a role model, but I'm only human

[Pre-Chorus]
I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know why
I do it every, every, every time
It's only when I'm lonely
Sometimes I just wanna cave and I don't wanna fight
I try and I try and I try and I try and I try
Just hold me, I'm lonely

[Chorus]
Momma, I'm so sorry, I'm not sober anymore
And daddy, please forgive me for the drinks spilled on the floor
To the ones who never left me, we've been down this road before
I'm so sorry, I'm not sober anymore
Im not sober anymore

[Outro]
I'm sorry that I'm here again, I promise I'll get help
It wasn't my intention, I'm sorry to myself[Verse 1]
Oh no, here we go again
Fighting over what I said
I'm sorry, yeah Im sorry
Bad at love, no, I'm not good at this
But I can't say Im innocent
Not hardly, but I'm sorry

[Pre-Chorus]
And all my friends, they know and it's true
I don't know who I am without you
I got it bad, baby
Got it bad

[Chorus]
Oh, tell me you love me
I need someone on days like this, I do
On days like this
Oh, tell me you love me

On days like this, I do
On days like this
Oh, can you hear my heart say
Ooohhhh, ooh
No, you ain't nobody 'til you got somebody
You ain't nobody 'til you got somebody

[Verse 2]
And I hope I never see the day
That you move on and be happy without me
Without me
Whats my hand without your heart to hold?
I dont know what I'm living for
If Im living without you

[Pre-Chorus]
All my friends, they know and it's true
I don't know who I am without you
I've got it bad, baby

No, you ain't nobody 'til you got somebody
You ain't nobody 'til you got somebody

I know that we will be alright, alright, yeah
Through the ups and downs
Baby, I'ma stick around
I promise we will be alright, alright

[Chorus]
Oh, tell me you love me
I need someone on days like this, I do

You ain't nobody 'til you got somebody

[Outro]
My heart's like
Ooooh, ooh
Everything I need
Is standing right in front of me
I know that we will be alright, alright, yeah[Verse 1]
Stone cold, stone cold
You see me standing, but I'm dying on the floor
Stone cold, stone cold
Maybe if I don't cry, I won't feel anymore

[Chorus]
Stone cold, baby
God knows I try to feel happy for you
Know that I am, even if I can't understand
I'll take the pain
Give me the truth
Me and my heart, we'll make it through
If happy is her, I'm happy for you

[Verse 2]
Hmmm, stone cold, stone cold
You're dancing with her, while I'm staring at my phone
Stone cold, stone cold
I was your amber, but now she's your shade of gold

[Chorus]
Stone cold, baby
God knows I try to feel happy for you
Know that I am, even if I can't understand
I'll take the pain
Give me the truth
Me and my heart, we'll make it through
If happy is her, I'm happy for you

[Outro]
Don't wanna be stone cold, stone
I wish I could mend this, but here's my goodbye
Oh, I'm happy for you
Know that I am, even if I can't understand
If happy is her
If happy is her
I'm happy for you[Intro]
Let it go, let it go
Cant hold it back anymore
Let it go, let it go
Turn my back and slam the door

[Verse 1]
The snow glows white on the mountain tonight
Not a footprint to be seen
A kingdom of isolation
And it looks like I'm the queen
The wind is howling like the swirling storm inside
Couldnt keep it in, Heaven knows I tried

[Pre-Chorus]
Dont let them in, dont let them see
Be the good girl you always have to be
Conceal, dont feel, dont let them know
Well, now they know

[Chorus]
Let it go, let it go
Cant hold it back anymore
Let it go, let it go
Turn my back and slam the door
And here I stand, and here I'll stay
Let it go, let it go
The cold never bothered me anyway

[Verse 2]
Its funny how some distance
Makes everything seem small
And the fears that once controlled me
Cant get to me at all
Up here in the cold thin air
I finally can breathe
I know left a life behind
But Im too relieved to grieve

[Chorus]
Let it go, let it go
Cant hold it back anymore
Let it go, let it go
Turn my back and slam the door
And here I stand, and here I'll stay
Let it go, let it go
The cold never bothered me anyway

[Bridge]
Standing frozen in the life Ive chosen
You won't find me, the past is so behind me
Buried in the snow

[Chorus]
Let it go, let it go
Cant hold it back anymore
Let it go, let it go
Turn my back and slam the door
And here I stand, and here I'll stay
Let it go, let it go
The cold never bothered me anyway

[Outro]
(Na na, na na) Yeah
(Na na na na na) Let it go
(Na na, na na) Yeah
(Na na na na na) Na na
(Na na, na na) Let it go
(Na na na na na) Let it go
(Na na) Let it go
(Na na) Ooh
(Na na na na na) Let it go[Intro]
Uh, uh

[Verse 1]
I tried to talk to my piano
I tried to talk to my guitar
Talked tomyimagination
Confided into alcohol
Itried and tried and tried somemore
Told secrets 'til my voice was sore
Tired of empty conversation
'Cause no one hears me anymore

[Pre-Chorus]
A hundred million stories
And a hundred million songs
I feel stupid when I sing
Nobody's listening to me
Nobody's listening
I talk to shooting stars
But they always get it wrong
I feel stupid when I pray
So, why am I praying anyway?
If nobody's listening

[Chorus]
Anyone, please send me anyone
Lord, is there anyone?
I need someone, oh
Anyone, please send me anyone
Lord, is there anyone?
I need someone

[Verse 2]
I used to crave the world's attention
I think I cried too many times
I just need some more affection
Anything to get me by

[Pre-Chorus]
A hundred million stories
And a hundred million songs
I feel stupid when I sing
Nobody's listening to me
Nobody's listening
I talk to shooting stars
But they always get it wrong
I feel stupid when I pray
Why the fuck am I praying anyway?
If nobody's listening

[Chorus]
Anyone, please send me anyone
Lord, is there anyone?
I need someone, oh
Anyone, please send me anyone
Oh, Lord, is there anyone?
I need someone
Oh, anyone, I need anyone
Oh, anyone, I need someone

[Outro]
A hundred million stories
And a hundred million songs
I feel stupid when I sing
Nobody's listening to me
Nobody's listening[Intro: Demi Lovato & YG]
Mmm, ooh, yeah
Mustard on the beat, hoe

[Verse 1: Demi Lovato]
He felt just like you
His arms, his lips
His promises were just as smooth
His grip, it fit, though, I admit, that
Only you could make me feel the way you do
Though, you know love is blind
And he just caught my eye

[Pre-Chorus: Demi Lovato]
You know me and honestly I'm better without ya
Don't you got me checking on my phone by the hour
Baby, I'm hoping and praying
My knees weak, I'm shaking
'Cause you know, that I always needed saving

[Chorus: Demi Lovato]
Now I'm fucking lonely and you didn't want me
Trying to show me, that you didn't own me
But all you do is leave me fucking lonely
Knees on the concrete, cut up and bleeding
For no Goddamn reason
But all you do is leave me fucking lonely
Leave me fucking lonely
Leave me fucking lonely
Leave me fucking lonely

[Verse 2: Demi Lovato]
The month was June
The smoky sun, our fatal run
It ended too soon
With tears as proof, 'cause all the carpets stained with juice
Blood on my shoes and you know love is blind
I can see it in your eyes

[Pre-Chorus: Demi Lovato]
You know me and honestly I'm better without ya
Don't you got me checking on my phone by the hour
Baby, I'm hoping and praying
My knees weak, I'm shaking
'Cause you know, that I always needed saving

[Chorus: Demi Lovato]
Now I'm fucking lonely, and you didn't want me
Trying to show me that you didn't own me
But all you do is leave me fucking lonely
Knees on the concrete, cut up and bleeding
For no Goddamn reason
But all you do is leave me fucking lonely
Leave me fucking lonely
Leave me fucking lonely
Leave me fucking lonely

[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]
Bitch, can't even say I miss you back over the fuckin' text
Every time you slept over my pad, you over fuckin' slept
Toni Braxton told me breathe again, don't hold no fuckin' breath
Gave your ass directions to my heart and your ass busted left
Climbin' up the money tree, the tree without the lover's nest
'Cause lovebirds are some busy bees
You fuck around, get stung again
And you didn't leave your underwear
'Cause she didn't arrive in no underwear
Look, baby, either love is blind or nothing's there
I can't see the forest from the tree, the water from the sea
And I was starting to believe, but it's a forest full of dreams
I smoke bars full of weed and call it what I see
And when you leave, I hope you know you bring
This forest to his leaves
I'm fucking lonely, yeah

[Final Chorus: Demi Lovato]
Lonely
Leave me fucking lonely
Leave me fucking lonely
Leave me fucking lonely[Verse 1]
Flippin' through all of these magazines
Tellin' me who I'm supposed to be
Way too good atcamouflage

I'm guilty 'bout everything that I eat (Every single thing)
Feelin'myselfisa felony

Voices in myhead make up my entourage

'Cause I'm a black belt when I'm beating uponmyself
But I'm anexpert at giving love to somebodyelse
I, me, myself and I don't see eye to eye
Me, myself and I

[Chorus]
Oh, why do I compare myself to everyone?
And I always got my finger on the self-destruct
I wonder when I love me is enough (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
I wonder when I love me is enough (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Why am I always looking for a ride or die?
'Cause mine's the only heart I'm gonna have for life
After all the times I went and fucked it up (All the times I went and fucked it up)
I wonder when I love me is enough, mmm (Yeah, yeah, yeah)

[Post-Chorus]
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)

Haters that live on the internet (On the internet)
Live in my head, should be paying rent
I'm way too good at listening (Listening)
All these comments fucking up my energy (Energy)

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause I'm a black belt when I'm beating uponmyself (Black belt)
But I'm anexpert at giving love to somebodyelse (Expert)

[Bridge]
I'm my own worst critic, talk a whole lot of shit
But I'm a ten out of ten even when I forget
I, I, I, I, I (I'm a ten out of ten, don't you ever forget it)
I'm my own worst critic, talk a whole lot of shit
But I'm a ten out of ten, even when I forget (Hey, oh)

Standing on the front lines
Staring at the sun rise over the hill
Waiting for the kill
Sweet anticipation, never conversation
Tears in our eyes from holding too tight

[Pre-Chorus]
Waiting till the demons come
Wait for us to see them run in our direction
Now they're staring at us through the trees
Got us falling to our knees to teach us a lesson

[Chorus]
So tell me
Did you ever really love me?
Did you ever really want me?
Now that I see you clearer
I wonder, was I ever really happy?
Didn't get the chance to ask me
Now that I see you clearer
Was it just smoke and mirrors?
Was it just smoke and mirrors?

[Verse 2]
Holding onto tables, pulling out the staples
Keeping you close, now we're not afloat
Point me in the right direction, answer me one question
'Cause I could've sworn that I wasn't wrong

[Pre-Chorus]
Waiting till the demons come
Wait for us to see them run in our direction
Staring at us through the trees
Got us falling to our knees to teach us a lesson (teach us a lesson)

[Chorus]
So tell me
Did you ever really love me?
Did you ever really want me?
Now that I see you clearer
I wonder, was I ever really happy?
Didn't get the chance to ask me
Now that I see you clearer
Was it just smoke and mirrors?
Ooh, was it just smoke and mirrors?

[Bridge]
Darling, I have been afraid
I could only call your name
Thank the heavens that you stayed
But if I'm telling you the truth
When I cut the tether loose
It was me, saving you

[Chorus]
So tell me
Did you ever really love me?
Did you ever really want me?
Now that I see you clearer
I wonder, was I ever really happy?
Didn't get the chance to ask me
Now that I see you clearer
Was it just smoke and mirrors?
Was it just smoke and mirrors?[Verse 1]
All I ever really wanted was someone to love me this good
You love me so good
Everybody knows I'm capable of breaking hearts like I've done
I've scarred more than one

[Pre-Chorus 1]
I, I, I
You and I
Get along like thunder and the rain
You, ooh, ooh
Make me feel everything, even when it's pain

[Chorus]
Congratulations, celebration
'Cause my heart is the hardest to break
Break up to make up
Just to wake up with mascara all over my face
And I'm no cry baby, but you make me cry lately
I'm no cry baby, but you make me cry, baby
I'm no cry baby, but you make me cry lately
I'm no cry baby, but you make me cry, baby
Cry, baby

[Verse 2]
How could someone so beautiful be so damn ugly
I guess I'm naive
'Cause everytime I start tripping, slipping then I'm falling too deep
Stuck in a bad dream

[Pre-Chorus 2]
I, I, I
You and I
Get along like fire to a plane
You, you, you
Make me feel like I'm fucking going so insane

[Chorus]
Congratulations, celebration
'Cause my heart is the hardest to break
Break up to make up
Just to wake up with mascara all over my face
And I'm no cry baby, but you make me cry lately
I'm no cry baby, but you make me cry, baby
I'm no cry baby, but you make me cry lately
I'm no cry baby, but you make me cry, baby
Cry, baby

[Bridge]
Congratulations, celebration
'Cause my heart is the hardest to break

[Chorus]
Congratulations, celebration
'Cause my heart is the hardest to break
Break up to make up
Just to wake up with mascara all over my face
And I'm no cry baby, but you make me cry lately
I'm no cry baby, but you make me cry, baby
I'm no cry baby, but you make me cry lately
I'm no cry baby, but you make me cry, baby
Cry, baby[Intro]
Puttin' my defenses up
'Cause I don't wanna fall in love
If I ever did that, I think I'd have a heart attack

[Verse 1]
Never put my love out on the line
Never said "yes" to the right guy
Never had trouble getting what I want
But when it comes to you, I'm never good enough
When I don't care
I can play 'em like a Ken doll
Won't wash my hair
Then make 'em bounce like a basketball

[Pre-Chorus 1]
But you make me wanna act like a girl
Paint my nails and wear high heels
Yes, you, make me so nervous that I just can't hold your hand

[Chorus]
You make me glow
But I cover up, won't let it show
So I'm putting my defenses up
'Cause I don't wanna fall in love
If I ever did that, I think I'd have a heart attack
I think I'd have a heart attack
I think I'd have a heart attack

[Verse 2]
Never break a sweat for the other guys
When you come around, I get paralyzed
And every time I try to be myself
It comes out wrong like a cry for help
It's just not fair
Pain's more trouble than love is worth
I gasp for air
It feels so good, but you know it hurts

[Pre-Chorus 2]
But you make me wanna act like a girl
Paint my nails and wear perfume for you
Make me so nervous that I just can't hold your hand

[Chorus]
You make me glow
But I cover up, won't let it show
So I'm putting my defenses up
'Cause I don't wanna fall in love
If I ever did that, I think I'd have a heart attack
I think I'd have a heart attack
I think I'd have a heart attack

[Bridge]
The feelings are lost in my lungs
They're burning, I'd rather be numb
And there's no one else to blame (No one else to blame)
So scared, I'll take off in a run
I'm flying too close to the sun and I'll burst into flames

[Chorus]
You make me glow
But I cover up, won't let it show
So I'm putting my defenses up
'Cause I don't wanna fall in love
If I ever did that, I think I'd have a heart attack
I think I'd have a heart attack (Heart attack)
I think I'd have a heart attack (-Tack)
Oh, I think I'd have a heart attack
I think I'd have a heart attack[Verse 1]
I see the future without you
The hell was I doing in the past?
Now that I've learned all about you
A love just like ours wouldn't last

[Pre-Chorus]
I won't fall for your games
So don't hate me when I say

[Chorus]
That you don't do it for me anymore
No, you don't do it for me anymore

[Verse 2]
Money won't pay for your problems
You gotta fix them yourself
Vices and pity won't solve 'em
Stop feeling bad for yourself

[Pre-Chorus]
I won't fall for your games
So don't hate me when I say

[Chorus]
That you don't do it for me anymore
No, you don't do it for me anymore

[Bridge]
I'm sorry for honesty
I could not bear to lie to you, to lie with you
I'm sorry for honesty
I'm well aware I lie to you when I lie with you

[Breakdown]
You don't do it for me anymore
No, you don't do it for me, don't do it for me

[Chorus]
You don't do it for me anymore
No, you don't do it for me anymore[Verse 1]
Tell me what you want
What you like
It's okay
I'm a little curious too
Tell me if it's wrong, if it's right
I don't care
I can keep a secret, can you?

[Pre-Chorus]
Got my mind on your body and your body on my mind
Got a taste for the cherry, I just need to take a bite
Don't tell your mother
Kiss one another
Die for each other
We're cool for the summer

[Break]
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh

[Chorus]
Take me down into your paradise
Don't be scared, 'cause I'm your body type
Just something that we wanna try
'Cause you and I, we're cool for the summer

[Verse 2]
Tell me if I won
If I did, what's my prize?
I just wanna play with you too
Even if they judge, fuck it, I'll do the time
I just wanna have some fun with you

[Pre-Chorus]
Got my mind on your body and your body on my mind
Got a taste for the cherry, I just need to take a bite
Don't tell your mother
Kiss one another
Die for each other
We're cool for the summer

[Break]
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh

[Chorus]
Take me down into your paradise
Don't be scared, 'cause I'm your body type
Just something that we wanna try
'Cause you and I, we're cool for the summer
We're cool for the summer
We're cool for the summer

[Interlude]
Shh...
Don't tell your mother

[Breakdown]
Got my mind on your body and your body on my mind
Got a taste for the cherry, I just need to take a bite

[Chorus]
(Take me down) Take me down into your paradise
(Don't be scared) Don't be scared, 'cause I'm your body type
Just something that we wanna try (wanna try)
'Cause you and I (you and I), we're cool for the summer

[Outro]
(Take me down) We're cool for the summer
(Don't be scared), 'cause I'm your body type
(Just something) Just something that we wanna try
'Cause you and I (you and I), we're cool for the summer
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
We're cool for the summer[Verse 1]
The day I first met you, you told me
You'd never fall in love
But now that I get you, I know fear is what it really was

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Now here we are
So close, yet so far
Haven't I passed the test?
When will you realize, baby, I'm not like the rest?

[Chorus 1]
Don't wanna break your heart
Wanna give your heart a break
I know you're scared it's wrong
Like you might make a mistake
There's just one life to live
And there's no time to wait, to waste
So let me give your heart a break, give your heart a break
Let me give your heart a break, your heart a break
Oh yeah, yeah

[Verse 2]
On Sunday, you went home, alone
There were tears in your eyes
I called your cell phone, my love, but you did not reply

[Pre-Chorus 2]
The world is ours if we want it
We can take it, if you just take my hand
There's no turning back now
Baby, try to understand

[Chorus 1]
Don't wanna break your heart
Wanna give your heart a break
I know you're scared, it's wrong
Like you might make a mistake
There's just one life to live
And there's no time to wait, to waste
So let me give your heart a break, give your heart a break
Let me give your heart a break, your heart a break
There's just so much you can take
Give your heart a break
Let me give your heart a break, your heart a break
Oh yeah, yeah

[Bridge]
When your lips are on my lips
Then our hearts beat as one
But you slip out of my fingertips
Every time you run, whoa, whoa

[Chorus 1]
Don't wanna break your heart (Don't wanna break your heart)
Wanna give your heart a break
I know you're scared, it's wrong
Like you might make a mistake (I know you're scared, it's wrong)
There's just one life to live
And there's no time to wait, to waste
So let me give your heart a break
(Let me give your heart a break)

[Chorus 2]
'Cause you've been hurt before
I can see it in your eyes
You try to smile it away
Some things you can't disguise
Don't wanna break your heart
Baby, I can ease the ache, the ache
So let me give your heart a break, give your heart a break
Let me give your heart a break, your heart a break
There's just so much you can take
Give your heart a break
Let me give your heart a break (Your heart)
Your heart a break (A break)
Oh yeah, yeah

[Outro]
The day I first met you, you told me you'd never fall in love[Intro]
(Go)

[Verse 1]
I call you too much
You never pick up
Except when you wanna f...
And I can't get enough
You're the man of my dreams
'Cause you know how to leave
But I really believe that you'd change it for me

[Pre-Chorus]
You're unavailable
(Unavailable)
I'm insatiable

[Chorus]
Lucky for you
I got all these daddy issues
What can I do?
I'm going crazy when I'm with you
Forget all the therapy that I've been through
Lucky for you
I got all these daddy issues
(All these daddy issues)

[Post-Chorus]
Daddy issues, uh
Daddy issues, uh

[Verse 2]
Don't know how to commit
But I might want your kid
And after our first kiss
Got your name on my wrist
Yeah, I get a little obsessive
A little aggressive, a little bit too invested
And whatever you want, whenever you want
That's what you get 'cause

[Pre-Chorus]
You're unavailable
(You're unavailable)
I'm insatiable

[Chorus]
Lucky for you
I got all these daddy issues
What can I do?
I'm going crazy when I'm with you
Forget all the therapy that I've been through
Lucky for you
I got all these daddy issues
(All these daddy issues)

[Post-Chorus]
Daddy issues, uh
Daddy issues, uh

[Bridge]
Never enough
Addicted to love with the wrong one

[Chorus]
Lucky for you
I got all these daddy issues
(All these daddy issues)
What can I do?
I'm going crazy when I'm with you (crazy)
Forget all the therapy that I've been through
(That I've been through)
Lucky for you (lucky for you)
I got all these daddy issues
(All these daddy issues)
Daddy issues, uh

Put down your cigar and pick me up (Pick me up)
Play me your guitar, that song I love (Song I love)
Thirsty for your love, fill up my cup (Up my cup)
I got only good intentions, so give me your attention

[Pre-Chorus]
You're only brave in the moonlight
So why don't you stay till sunrise?

[Chorus]
Your body's looking good tonight
I'm thinking we should cross the line
Let's ruin the friendship, let's ruin the friendship
Do all the things on our minds
What's taking us all this time
Let's ruin the friendship, let's ruin the friendship

[Verse 2]
Baby, you and I got history (History)
And we can't deny our chemistry (Chemistry)
So why the fuck are we a mystery? (Mystery)
Let's just go with the connection, give me your affection

[Pre-Chorus]
You're only brave in the moonlight
So why don't you stay till sunrise?

[Chorus]
Your body's looking good tonight
I'm thinking we should cross the line
Let's ruin the friendship, let's ruin the friendship
Do all the things on our minds
What's taking us all this time
Let's ruin the friendship, let's ruin the friendship

[Bridge]
No, I can't keep denying every minute I think of you
No, I can't keep denying every minute I think of you
No, I can't keep denying every minute I think of you
No, I can't keep denying every minute I think of you

[Chorus]
Your body's looking good tonight
I'm thinking we should cross the line
Let's ruin the friendship, let's ruin the friendship
Do all the things on our minds
What's taking us all this time
Let's ruin the friendship, let's ruin the friendship[Verse 1]
If I had it my way, I would take you down
If I had it my way, I would turn you out
And if my body had a say, I would come again
Scared of what I might say, cause I'm at the edge

[Pre-Chorus]
And our eyes are crossing paths across the room (Ooh)
There's only one thing left for us to do

[Chorus]
You can touch me with slow hands
Speed it up, baby, make me sweat
Dreamland, take me there cause I want your sex
If my body had a say, I wouldn't turn away
Touch, make love, taste you
If my body told the truth, baby I would do
Just what I want to

[Verse 2]
If I had it my way, I would take the lead
And if I had it my way, I would take you deep
If my body had a say, I'd get it off my chest
Show you all the red lace underneath this dress

[Pre-Chorus]
And our eyes are crossing paths across the room (Ooh)
There's only one thing left for us to do

[Chorus]
You can touch me with slow hands
Speed it up, baby, make me sweat
Dreamland, take me there cause I want your sex
If my body had a say, I wouldn't turn away

Just what I want to

[Bridge]
My mind's getting in the way
Can't feel what my body say

Just what I want to (Want to, want to, want to)[Intro]
Stop playing games, games, games...

[Verse 1]
Text on 'read', and it ain't no accident
Boy, I ain't gon' ask again
Now you got me in my head
Waiting by the phone at night, that's shit that I don't do
And I just can't explain what's happening

[Pre-Chorus]
Sending all these messages alone at night, on Patron at night
In the morning, different story, ain't that right?

[Chorus]
I don't know why you play these games
Come on, now say what you wanna say
Careful when you play these games
You might find out the hard way that two can play
Yeah, two can play
Yeah, two can play
Yeah, two can play these games
And you know it's driving me insane
Careful when you play these games
You might find out the hard way that two can play
Yeah, two can play
Yeah, two can play
Yeah, two can play, yeah

[Verse 2]
I date men, but you're acting like a little boy
And no, I ain't your little toy
Honey, I don't need new friends
Figure out just what you want, and what the hell you're waiting on
Before you hit my phone again

[Pre-Chorus]
Sending all these messages alone at night, Patron at night
In the morning, different story, ain't that right?

[Chorus]
I don't know why you play these games
C'mon, now say what you wanna say
Careful when you play these games
You might find out the hard way that two can play

And you know it's driving me insane
Careful when you play these games
You might find out the hard way that two can play
Yeah, two can play

[Bridge]
Now I know you're used to winning
And I'm tired of keeping score
But if you're ready to quit it, maybe I can be yours

[Chorus]
I don't know why you play these games
C'mon, now say what you wanna say
Careful when you play these games
You might find out the hard way that two can play
Yeah, two can play
Yeah, two can play

And you know it's driving me insane
Careful when you play these games
You might find out the hard way that two can play
Yeah, two can play
Yeah, two can play

Are you ready?
Ha

[Verse 1]
It's time for me to take it
I'm the boss right now
Not gonna fake it
Not when you go down
'Cause this is my game, and you better come to play
I used to hold my freak back, now I'm letting go
I make my own choice
Bitch, I run this show
So leave the lights on
No, you can't make me behave

[Pre-Chorus]
(Oh-oh-oh)
So, you say I'm complicated
That I must be out my mind
But you've had me underrated-rated-rated

[Chorus]
(Uh-huh) What's wrong with being, what's wrong with being
What's wrong with being confident?
(Uh-huh) What's wrong with being, what's wrong with being
What's wrong with being confident?
(Uh-huh)

[Verse 2]
It's time to get the chains out
Is your tongue tied up?
'Cause this is my ground and I'm dangerous
And you can get off
But it's all 'bout me tonight (tonight, ha)

[Pre-Chorus]
(Oh-oh-oh)
So, you say I'm complicated
That I must be out my mind
But you've had me underrated-rated-rated

[Chorus]
(Uh-huh) What's wrong with being, what's wrong with being
What's wrong with being confident?
(Uh-huh, yeah) What's wrong with being (yeah), what's wrong with being (yeah)
What's wrong with being confident?
(Uh-huh) What's wrong with being, what's wrong with being
What's wrong with being confident?
(Uh-huh) What's wrong with being, what's wrong with being
What's wrong with being confident?
(Uh-huh)

[Interlude]
Uh-huh
Hey!
La la, yeah

[Breakdown]
So, you say I'm complicated
But you've had me underrated
Yeah yeah

[Chorus]
(Uh-huh) What's wrong with being, what's wrong with being (what's wrong with being)
What's wrong with being confident?
(Uh-huh, yeah) What's wrong with being (yeah), what's wrong with being (yeah)
What's wrong with being confident?
(Uh-huh) What's wrong with being, what's wrong with being
What's wrong with being confident?
(Uh-huh) What's wrong with being, what's wrong with being
What's wrong with being confident?
(Uh-huh)[Verse 1]
This is a story that I have never told
I gotta get this off my chest to let it go
I need to take back the light inside you stole
You're a criminal, and you steal like you're a pro

[Pre-Chorus 1]
All the pain and the truth
I wear like a battle wound
So ashamed, so confused
I was broken and bruised

[Chorus]
Now I'm a warrior, now I've got thicker skin
I'm a warrior, I'm stronger than I've ever been
And my armor is made of steel, you can't get in
I'm a warrior, and you can never hurt me again

[Verse 2]
Out of the ashes, I'm burning like a fire
You can save your apologies, you're nothing but a liar
I've got shame, I've got scars, that I will never show
I'm a survivor, in more ways than you know

[Pre-Chorus 2]
'Cause all the pain and the truth
I wear like a battle wound
So ashamed, so confused
I'm not broken or bruised

[Chorus]
'Cause now I'm a warrior, now I've got thicker skin
I'm a warrior, I'm stronger than I've ever been
And my armor is made of steel, you can't get in
I'm a warrior, and you can never hurt me

[Bridge]
There's a part of me I can't get back
A little girl grew up too fast
All it took was once, I'll never be the same
Now I'm taking back my life today
Nothing left that you can say
'Cause you were never gonna take the blame anyway

[Chorus]
Now I'm a warrior, I've got thicker skin
I'm a warrior, I'm stronger than I've ever been
And my armor is made of steel, you can't get in
I'm a warrior, and you can never hurt me again

[Outro]
Oh, oh
Ooh, yeah, yeah
You can never hurt me... again[Verse 1]
Skies are crying, I am watching
Catching tear drops in my hands
Only silence as it's ending
Like we never had a chance
Do you have to make me feel like there's nothing left of me?

[Chorus]
You can take everything I have
You can break everything I am
Like I'm made of glass
Like I'm made of paper
Go on and try to tear me down
I will be rising from the ground
Like a skyscraper
Like a skyscraper

[Verse 2]
As the smoke clears
I awaken and untangle you from me
Would it make you feel better to watch me while I bleed?
All my windows still are broken, but I'm standing on my feet

[Chorus]
You can take everything I have
You can break everything I am
Like I'm made of glass
Like I'm made of paper
Go on and try to tear me down
I will be rising from the ground
Like a skyscraper
Like a skyscraper

[Bridge]
Go run, run, run
I'm gonna stay right here
Watch you disappear
Yeah, oh
Go run, run, run
Yeah, it's a long way down
But I am closer to the clouds up here

[Chorus]
You can take everything I have
You can break everything I am
Like I'm made of glass
Like I'm made of paper, oh oh
Go on and try to tear me down
I will be rising from the ground
Like a skyscraper
Like a skyscraper
Like a skyscraper
Like a skyscraper
Like a skyscraper[Verse 1]
I've been thinking 'bout the future
And I've been thinking 'bout the now
I know we're gonna be together
I just don't know how

[Pre-Chorus]
You know when we get close
Can't deny the tension between us both
And I don't wanna pressure you, but I think you need to make a move

[Chorus]
I've been waiting (I've been waiting)
And I'll keep waiting (I'll keep waiting)
Only forever, only forever, only forever, only forever
Only forever, only forever, only forever, only forever

[Verse 2]
Yeah, I can tell that you're terrified to take a shot this strong
Should I wait up for you day and night?
Just let me know how long

[Pre-Chorus]
You know when we get close
Can't deny the tension between us both
And I don't wanna pressure you, but I think you need to make a move

[Chorus]
'Cause I've been waiting (I've been waiting)
And I'll keep waiting (I'll keep waiting)
Only forever, only forever, only forever, only forever
Only forever, only forever, only forever, only forever

[Bridge]
What if I told you it's too late?
What if I say that I can't wait?
What if I meet somebody else who doesn't leave me on a shelf?
I'll give you one more chance, but it only lasts

[Chorus]
Only forever, only forever, only forever, only forever
Only forever, only forever, only forever, only forever[Verse 1]
Bottles of Merlot, I can't stand up now
Boy, you got me feeling so weak
Your ocean was drowning me, arms wrapped around me
Now I'm getting in too deep
Not falling cause I want to
Baby, you keep pushing me
Don't love you cause I need to, but it's everything you do to me, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
Make music when you're moanin'
From night until the morning
Just tell me when you're ready
And Imma paint your body with my lips

[Chorus]
Baby, I'll do anything you want
Lock me down like I'm your slave
'Cause ooh, when you're done with me
I can't even concentrate, concentrate
Ooh, I cant even concentrate
No, hey, yeah

[Verse 2]
Drag of a cigarette, sheets are all soaking wet
Coldplay on the radio
You keep running through my head
Wanna do it again, we can take it nice and slow

[Pre-Chorus]
Make music when you're moanin'
From night until the morning
Just tell me when you're ready
And Imma paint your body with my lips

[Chorus]
Baby, I'll do anything you want
Lock me down like I'm your slave
'Cause ooh, when you're done with me
I can't even concentrate
Ooh, I can't' concentrate
(Yeah) I can't concentrate
(Yeah) What you do to me, baby
(Yeah) Ooh
Baby, I'll do anything you want
Lock me down like your slave
'Cause ooh, when you're done with me
I can't even concentrate
I can't even concentrate
I can't even concentrate
I can't even concentrate[Verse 1]
Hittin' me up late
Always be blowin' up my phone
I'm lying awake wonderin' why I'm still alone
Lord knows I am sinning
Please forgive me for my lust
Sending pictures back and forth
Babe, I'm craving your touch

[Pre-Chorus]
You're my new obsession
Let go of any hesitation
Baby, be my new addiction
Intoxicate me gently with your loving

[Chorus]
You got me so high
Pull me closer into you and watch our bodies intertwine
I feel so alive
You know what I'm thinking of
Got me dreamin' 'bout that sexy dirty love
Sexy dirty love (dirty love) (sexy, sexy... yeah)
Sexy dirty love (dirty love) (sexy, sexy... yeah)
Sexy dirty love (dirty love) (sexy, sexy... yeah)

[Verse 2]
Now you're teasing me and I can't help but do the same
Whispering through your phone
Now youre driving me insane
It's like you're getting off on messing with my sanity (sanity)
Hang up, come on over
Let's play out this fantasy

[Pre-Chorus]
You're my new obsession
Let go of any hesitation
Baby, be my new addiction
Intoxicate me gently with your loving

[Chorus]
You got me so high
Pull me closer into you and watch our bodies intertwine

Sexy dirty love (dirty love) (sexy, sexy... yeah)
Sexy dirty love (dirty love) (sexy, sexy... yeah)
Sexy dirty love (dirty love) (sexy, sexy... yeah)[Verse 1]
You speak to me
And in your words, I hear a melody
But in the twilight it's so hard to see what's wrong for me
I can't resist
Until you give the truth a little twist
As if you're gonna get away with this
You're not sorry

[Pre-Chorus]
I can't believe I fell for this

[Chorus]
I fell through the hole
Down at the bottom of your soul
Didn't think you could go so low
Look at what you've done
You're losing me, here's what you've won
Got me planning to go solo
Solo

[Verse 2]
You sing to me
Too bad you couldn't even stay on key
If your life is such a mystery, why don't you stick to acting?
Oh, here you go again
You couldn't find my number until when (Until when)
You thought that you could get to my best friend
Without a script your game is lacking

[Pre-Chorus]
I can't believe I fell for this (I fell for this)

[Chorus]
I fell through the hole
Down at the bottom of your soul
Didn't think you could go so low
Look at what you've done
You're losing me, here's what you've won
Got me planning to go solo
Solo

[Bridge]
I'd rather go to a party alone
Than have to walk around with you on my arm
Now that I'm proud to admit that we're done
Good luck trying to find me
Oh

[Breakdown]
'Cause I didn't think you could go so low
Look at what you've done
You're losing me, here's what you've won
Got me planning to go solo

[Outro]
Now we're done
'Cause you got me planning to go solo
Solo, solo, solo...[Verse 1: Demi Lovato]
You wanna play, you wanna stay, you wanna have it all
You started messing with my head until I hit a wall
Maybe I should've known
Maybe I should've known
That you would walk, you would walk out the door (hey)
Said we were done, then met someone and rubbed it in my face
Cut to the part, she broke your heart, and then she ran away
I guess you should've known
I guess you should've known that I would talk, I would talk

[Chorus: Demi Lovato]
But even if the stars and moon collide
I never want you back into my life
You can take your words and all your lies
Oh-oh-oh, I really don't care
Even if the stars and moon collide
I never want you back into my life
You can take your words and all your lies
Oh-oh-oh, I really don't care
Oh-oh-oh, I really don't care

[Verse 2: Demi Lovato]
I can't believe I ever stayed up writing songs about you
You don't deserve to know the way I used to think about you
Oh, no, not anymore
Oh, no, not anymore
You had your shot, had your shot, but you let go
Now if we meet out on the street, I won't be running scared
I'll walk right up to you and put one finger in the air
And make you understand
And make you understand
You had your chance, had your chance

[Chorus: Demi Lovato]
But even if the stars and moon collide
I never want you back into my life
You can take your words and all your lies
Oh-oh-oh, I really don't care
Even if the stars and moon collide
I never want you back into my life
You can take your words and all your lies
Oh-oh-oh, I really don't care
Oh-oh-oh, I really don't care

[Bridge: Cher Lloyd]
Yeah, listen up
Hey, hey, never look back
Dumbstruck boy
Ego intact
Look boy, why you so mad?
Second guessing, but should've hit that
Hey, Demi, you picked the wrong lover
Should've picked that one, he's cuter than the other
I just wanna laugh, 'cause you tryna be a hipster
Kick it to the curb, take a Polaroid picture

[Chorus: Demi Lovato]
But even if the stars and moon collide
I never want you back into my life
You can take your words and all your lies
Oh-oh-oh, I really don't care
Even if the stars and moon collide
I never want you back into my life
You can take your words and all your lies
Oh-oh-oh, I really don't care
Oh-oh-oh, I really don't care[Letra de "Tell Me You Love Me (Spanish Version)"]

Ooh, yeah
I can't explain what's going on
Something happened when you came along, oh
It's driving me crazy, crazy
You're taking me to new places
And I pretend I'm not anxious, but oh
You're driving me crazy, crazy

[Pre-Chorus]
I was walking down this broken road
I was stranded, I was all alone
Always played it safe when it came to love
Until you came and picked me up

[Chorus]
I've been waitin' all night, lookin' for your headlights
I know that we're strangers, but I'll leave it all for you
Go anywhere you wanna go
I don't really need to know, if my heart is in danger
'Cause as long as you're the driver
I'm your hitchhiker, yeah
I'm your hitchhiker, yeah, yeah mmm...

[Verse 2]
Don't even know where we're going
You make me live in the moment, oh, oh
Keep driving us, baby

Can we love until there's nothing left and we're collecting dust?
Use the hell out of our golden souls until we're flecks of rust

[Pre-Chorus: Demi Lovato]
A love so deep, nothing else like it
Scars go deep, but they can't find it
Flame so bright, make the daylight look dark
Cross my heart that I'd die for ya
Cross my heart that I'll always keep ya
Cross my heart like a bittersweet tattoo
And we go...

[Chorus: Demi Lovato]
Oh, you're my kingdom come
Oh, you're my kingdom come
Sit me on your throne
Yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse 2: Demi Lovato]
Let it intertwine your hand in mine and fill the empty space
All the demons cry, 'cause you and I found love in a broken place

[Pre-Chorus: Demi Lovato]
A love so deep, nothing else like it
Scars go deep, but they can't find it
Flame so bright, make the daylight look dark
Cross my heart that I'd die for ya
Cross my heart that I'll always keep ya
Cross my heart like a bittersweet tattoo
And we go...

Gather 'round, now I'm back from my holiday
"Long live the Queen," what the people say
And that be me
I gotta king in my cavalry
Them other knights say goodnight, they get apathy
You'll never catch an Adam without Eve
You'll never catch a Blue without Steve
See, what I mean, you're my Caesar
Burn my chariot
You know Family Matters
What's Carl without Harriet?
Inseparable, like Mary Kate and Ashley
Incredible, I'm ready if you ask me to ride on them
"Them" meaning "chicks", ya feel me?
I break 'em down, it's a sport, I should win an ESPY
Royalty another level, boy, your throne shine
Legendary love
The nation needs a paradigm
Call all the king's horses and all the kinsmen
We rule until the end (kingdom come)

Even if you started this this whole war in me

[Chorus]
You did your best, or did you?
Sometimes I think I hate you

Wide awake and so confused
Everything's in line, but I am bruised
I need a voice to echo
I need a light to take me home
I kinda need a hero
Is it you?

I never see the forest for the trees
I could really use your melody
Baby, I'm a little blind
I think it's time for you to find me

You could be my sanity
Bring me peace
Sing me to sleep
Say you'll be my nightingale

Somebody speak to me, 'cause I'm feeling like hell
Need you to answer me

Like a raging roar
Like an ocean born
You're in my veins
Your voice is serenity when the sun goes down
And the strength I've found is in my veins

[Pre-Chorus]
Our story binds us like right and wrong
Your hand in mine

I am confident, but I still have my moments
Baby, that's just me
I'm not a supermodel, I still eat McDonald's
Baby, that's just me

[Chorus]
Well, some may say I need to be afraid of losing everything
Because of where I had my start and where I made my name
Well, everything's the same in the la la land machine
Machine, machine

[Verse 2]
Who said I can't wear my converse with my dress?
Well, baby, that's just me
Who said I can't be single and have to go out and mingle?
Baby, that's not me
No, no

[Chorus]
Well, some may say I need to be afraid of losing everything
Because of where I had my start and where I made my name
Well, everything's the same in the la la land

[Bridge]
Tell me, do you feel the way I feel?
'Cause nothing else is real in the la la land appeal

[Chorus]
Some may say I need to be afraid of losing everything
Because of where I had my start and where I made my name
Well, everything's the same in the la la land machine
Well, I'm not gonna change in the la la land machine
I will stay the same in the la la land...

Insecure situations
Had me down, so degraded
Felt no pain
Didn't know what I wanted
Coulda had it and lost it all in one day
Gravity without center
Came and pulled me together
Just the same
Saw the gold in the embers
Way before I had ever called your name

[Chorus]
I wasn't ready for ya, ready for ya
Then you came in like I adore ya, I adore ya
You caught me comin' off the back of another mistake
That was all I could make in my immature state
I wasn't ready for ya, ready for ya
Then you came in like I adore ya, I adore ya
You caught me comin' off the back of another mistake
That was all I could make in my immature state
I wasn't ready for ya
Ooh, I wasn't ready for ya

[Verse 2]
You were done with the fake shit
These put-on situations had to change
I'd been high, I'd been wasted
Using like I had nothing left to save
Called me out, you were honest
Must be crazy to want this mess I'd made
I was broken and wildish
Dumb, I was childish
And anything good was too good for me

[Chorus]
I wasn't ready for ya, ready for ya
Then you came in like I adore ya, I adore ya
You caught me comin' off the back of another mistake
That was all I could make in my immature state
I wasn't ready for ya, ready for ya
Then you came in like I adore ya, I adore ya
You caught me comin' off the back of another mistake
That was all I could make in my immature state
I wasn't ready for ya
Ooh, I wasn't ready for ya

[Bridge]
I was trying too hard (too hard)
Thought I could hold my cards (my cards)
When you threw me off my guard
You took me by surprise (surprise)
And that's when you saved my life (my life)
Now I want you 'til I die

[Chorus]
I wasn't ready for ya, ready for ya
Then you came in like I adore ya, I adore ya
You caught me comin' off the back of another mistake
That was all I could make in my immature state
I wasn't ready for ya
I wasn't ready for ya
I wasn't ready for ya
I wasn't ready for ya[Verse 1]
Our love runs deep like a Chevy
If you fall, I'll fall with you, baby
'Cause that's the way we like to do it
That's the way we like
You run around, open doors like a gentleman
Tell me, girl, every day of my everything
'Cause that's the way you like to do it
That's the way you like

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Just a little West Coast and a bit of sunshine
Hair blowing in the wind, losing track of time
Just you and I
Just you and I
Whoa, whoa

[Chorus]
No matter how far we go
I want the whole world to know I want you bad
And I won't have it any other way
No matter what the people say
I know that we'll never break
'Cause our love was made, made in the USA
Made in the USA, yeah

[Verse 2]
You always reading my mind like a letter
When I'm cold, you're there like a sweater
'Cause that's the way we like to do it
That's the way we like
And never ever let the world get the best of you
Every night we're apart, I'm still next to you
'Cause that's the way I like to do it
That's the way I like

[Pre-Chorus 2]
We touch down on the East Coast
Dinner in the sky rise
Winter is the best time for walking in the city lights
You and I
You and I
Whoa, whoa

[Chorus]
No matter how far we go
I want the whole world to know I want you bad
And I won't have it any other way
No matter what the people say
I know that we'll never break
'Cause our love was made, made in the USA

[Bridge]
'Cause, baby, I'll break the bullet
And take the blow for love, whoa
Our love was made in the USA
Made in the USA
Made in the USA

[Chorus]
No matter how far we go
I want the whole world to know I want you bad
And I won't have it any other way
No matter what the people say
I know that we'll never break
'Cause our love was made, made in the USA
Made in the USA, yeah

[Outro]
Made in the US
Made in the US
Made in the USA[Verse 1]
Four years old, with my back to the door
All I could hear was the family war
Your selfish hands always expecting more
Am I your child, or just a charity ward?

[Pre-Chorus]
You have a hollowed out heart, but it's heavy in your chest
I try so hard to fight it, but it's hopeless
Hopeless, you're hopeless

[Chorus]
Oh, father
Please, father
I'd love to leave you alone, but I can't let you go
Oh, father
Please, father
Put the bottle down for the love of a daughter
Oh

[Verse 2]
It's been five years since we've spoken last
And you can't take back what we never had
Oh, I can be manipulated only so many times
Before even "I love you" starts to sound like a lie

[Pre-Chorus]
You have a hollowed out heart, but it's heavy in your chest
I try so hard to fight it, but it's hopeless
Hopeless, you're hopeless

[Chorus]
Oh, father
Please, father
I'd love to leave you alone, but I can't let you go
Oh, father
Please, father
Put the bottle down for the love of a daughter

[Bridge]
Don't you remember, I'm your baby girl?
How could you push me out of your world?
Lied to your flesh and your blood
Put your hands on the ones that you swore you loved
Don't you remember, I'm your baby girl?
How could you throw me right out of your world?
So young when the pain had begun
Now forever afraid of being loved

[Breakdown]
Oh, father
Please, father
I'd love to leave you alone, but I can't let you go
Oh, father
Please, father

[Outro]
Oh, father
Please, father
Put the bottle down for the love of a daughter
For the love of a daughter[Verse 1: Demi Lovato]
You said that you'd never hurt me
Be the band-aid when I bleed
But I guess that that band-aid was all made of paper
'Cause you never stuck to me
And you say that you conquered the lion without even tryin'
But she only gets stronger
She only bites harder and I only die fighting

[Pre-Chorus: Demi Lovato]
You can run
You can run, but you know that I know just what you've done
You can run
You can run, but save those words for one on one

[Chorus: Demi Lovato]
So when the lights go down and the sun hits ground
You should know that I won't back down
(I'll be waitin' for you)
Knuckles out, and the guard in my mouth
When you're hungry for the next round
(I'll be waitin' for you)
Oh-oh, oh-oh-ooh, I'll be waitin' for you
Oh-oh, oh-oh-ooh, I'll be waitin' for you
Oh-oh, oh-oh-ooh
Mmm

[Verse 2: Demi Lovato]
Yeah, don't take things too personal, but you made shit personal
Talkin' 'bout my bad habits
Man, fuck my bad habits
Don't act like you got none

[Pre-Chorus: Demi Lovato]
You can run
You can run, but you know that I know just what you've done
You can run
You can run, but save those words for one on one

[Chorus: Demi Lovato]
So when the lights go down and the sun hits ground
You should know that I won't back down
(I'll be waitin' for you)
Knuckles out, and the guard in my mouth
When you're hungry for the next round
(I'll be waitin' for you)
Oh-oh, oh-oh-ooh, I'll be waitin' for you
Oh-oh, oh-oh-ooh, I'll be waitin' for you
Oh-oh, oh-oh-ooh
Mmm

[Verse 3: Sirah]
You got my name in your mouth
Forgive me when I knock it out
I love it when you talk about me just 'cause you don't know yourself
My jabs go go for broke
Your teeth is on the floor
Thirty million people watchin', do you still want more?
Fake bitches gon' get it
I am winnin', but you isn't
Call your dentist 'cause I meant this, I don't see no competition
Goin' wild, Mikey Tyson, born a fighter, I will triumph
Bitch, I thought you knew I was comin' for your title

[Chorus: Demi Lovato]
So when the lights go down and the sun hits ground
You should know that I won't back down
(I'll be waitin' for you)
Knuckles out, and the guard in my mouth
When you're hungry for the next round
(I'll be waitin' for you)
Oh-oh, oh-oh-ooh, I'll be waitin' for you
Oh-oh, oh-oh-ooh, I'll be waitin', I'll be waitin' for you
Oh-oh, oh-oh-ooh, I'll be waitin' for you[Chorus]
Day to night to morning, keep with me in the moment

Didn't even notice, nopunches left to roll with
You got to keep me focused; you want it? Say so
Day to night to morning, keep with me in the moment
I'd let you had I known it, why don't you say so?
Didn't even notice, no punches left to roll with
You got to keep me focused; you want it? Say so

[Verse 1]
It's been a long time since you fell in love
You ain't coming out your shell, you ain't really been yourself
Tell me, what must I do? (Do tell, my love)
'Cause luckily I'm good at reading
I wouldn't bug him, but he won't stop cheesin'
And we can dance all day around it
If you frontin', I'll be bouncing
If you want it, scream it, shout it, babe
Before I leave you dry

[Chorus]
Day to night to morning, keep with me in the moment
I'd let you had I known it, why don't you say so?
Didn't even notice, no punches left to roll with
You got to keep me focused; you want it? Say so
Day to night to morning, keep with me in the moment
I'd let you had I known it, why don't you say so?
Didn't even notice, no punches left to roll with
You got to keep me focused; you want it? Say so (Yeah)

[Verse 2]
Let me check my chest, my breath right quick (Ha)
He ain't ever seen it in a dress like this (Ah)
He ain't ever even been impressed like this
Prolly why I got him quiet on the set like zip

Met him on Tinder, he just swipe left on bitches

She's just like candy, she's so sweet
But you know that it ain't real cherry, know that it ain't real cherry
She's just like candy, she's so sweet
But you know that it ain't real, know that it ain't real

[Verse 2]
I can be your sugar when you're fiendin' for that sweet spot
Put me in your mouth, baby, and eat it 'til your teeth rot
I can be your cherry, apple, pecan, or your key lime
Baby I got everything and so much more than she's got

[Pre-Chorus]
And it's such a typical thing, runnin' over a billion men
Runnin' through a difficult place, you don't need no blood on your hands, no

[Chorus]
She's just like candy, she's so sweet
But you know that it ain't real cherry, know that it ain't real cherry
She's just like candy, she's so sweet
But you know that it ain't real, know that it ain't real
She's just like candy, she's so sweet
But you know that it ain't real cherry, know that it ain't real cherry
She's just like candy, she's so sweet
But you know that it ain't real, know that it ain't real

They say I bang, they never toy with me
Royal from the crown to my fucking feet
They say talk that talk, walk, but please avoid the streets
Lock the jaw, lock the door, avoid the speech

Pop a pill, cop a feel, rock the lease

He calls me copper tone, smokin' ultraviolet
We turn off the phone, I'm in autopilot
Make that disappear Mr. Copperfield
When we ride, he bust them tricks, I lean and pop a wheel
Watching Brandy, sippin' brandy
Panties on the marble floor, guess my pants is fancy
Bitches acting catty on the set
Make your man tatt me on his neck
Or tap me on your back
Uhhh, that's nasty, but I'm classy with this shit
So pop a couple xannies for me quick

Feel that slow high setting in
Let it take you to a place you ain't never been
Like floating on cotton candy clouds
Shirt and panties on the ground
This kitty's hot, fan it down
Make moves on me, papi, don't stand around
One for you, one for me, when we break a half
Your gentle touch on my naked ass
These summer nights, when that AC blast
Them bars put ease to your crazy past so
Baby if you need it come and get it
Just can't hold this back from you
Now pop this with me

The beach is a good place to pick up girls because you can really seewhatyou're getting
Most beachesare full of chicks
And theyre-and they're-andthey're-and theyre-and they're-and they're-and they're-and they're
Hm, mm, mm

[Verse]
I've been moving in backward directions
During astral projections
I plaster my ass in the wall for attention
I need faster connections
Past is regret, I have flashed from the genesis
If I didn't care what my friends did
Friends are pretend
Wanna end when you get bit
Get slick, get quick, wanna send shit
Ends with a sniff, or a huff, or injection
I can't handle rejection
Cant stand my reflection, damn, no one gets it
Should I be kind and remind that Im weak?
So I fall behind every week?
I'm too shy when the guys take a peek
I cry from my eyes to my feet
Stairs to the street to the gutters to the sea
When I mutter in my sleep, I say Mother never weep
My brother finds blood, I say Shut up fore she sees
Another motherfucking trap
W-wonder when she weeps, w-wonder where she be
Thunder on my teeth, spit natural disasters
God told me, "Cat, dont mess with the past tense"
You're testing the masters, so guess what the fact is
My ex is a bachelor
Next, can they get big checks from the sets?
Next, from the dancers
Text from the models, this Hennessy is cursed
Someone hexed all the bottles

[Pre Chorus]
I swear on my life I always try
But in my eyes, I can fly
Sigh

[Chorus]
Better luck next time
Better-better-better luck next time
Better luck next time (Next time)
Better-better-better luck next time

And he take me out, dinin' on nothin' but the best

Makin' plans from the East, makin' bands in the West
Rockstar, Black Beatle type, bands on his bread
And baby, I want it, and I'll just be honest
'Cause I just can't front when I look at you
Just keep it one hundred, when I throw these hundreds
I hope that your ass gon' know what to do

I'll put the ring on when you ready
We play our fantasies out in real life ways and
No Final Fantasy, can we end these games though?
You give me energy, make me feel lightweight
Like the birds of a feather, baby
We real life made for each other
And it's hard to keep my cool
When other bitches tryna get with my dude and
When other chickens tryna get in my coop
'Cause you're a one in a million
There ain't no man like you

[Chorus]
Like you, like you
Like you, ooh
I found it hard to find someone like you
Like you, like you
Send your location, come through

[Post-Chorus]
I can't sleep no more
In my head, we belong
And I can't be without you
Why can't I find no one like you?
I can't sleep no more
In my head, we belong
And I can't be without you
Why can't I find no one like you?[Intro: Doja Cat]

Natural hair poppin', don't ever get it twisted
She at your scalp for the fame
Nah, nah, nah, nigga, listen, let me lecture, see
When it be about the bread, oh, want the Quiznos, don't test it, ayy

[Verse 1]
Hey, Nayima, 'sup Sabrina
Hey, Naomi, love your features
With a little bit of rouge on the cheek
Bronze little bombshells cruise by the beach
Louis on the clutch, 'Boutin on the feets
I'm doing too much with your dude in the sheets
N-n-n-n-now you soft like 300 count
Little rubber band tuckin' 300 thou'
Throw it on the floor, make 300 bounce
Can you make a 16 come out 300 mouths?
(I might, I might, I might just have a)
'Cause I might have a check in the mail
I might get 'em wetter like I'm underneath the sail
Hungry little bunny I am coming for your kale
So I can keep my mommy up and spend a hundred on the nails

[Bridge]
As usual I'm suitable
Cute from the cooch to my cuticles
And boo, you should know I'm so doable
It's quite provable that we beautiful

It's your brains, how they working
Get that good sookie-sookie
I'm sorry if your man can't stop lookie-lookin'
Mistook me for a ho', and ain't nobody playing hookie
And you ain't found your girl on Tinder yet
The cookie like a temple, you could call it gingerbread
Be a good example at least on the internet
Shorty posting all them selfies, help me, is you single yet?
Tell me, is you into head?
'Cause maybe we can intersect
'Cause sexually you interest
Boy, visually you is a yes
(No respect)
And you dudes don't do your duty
Can't see me shake my head at you, too focused on the booty
You bastard bachelors is really acting like you're Clooney
Ya'll truly won't be players 'til you learn to see the beauty
(Male groupies)
Can't say I blame you, if I was you I would do me
I'm a cutie-patootie but don't mistake that for hoochie
'Cause even if you think you knew me
A woman changes with the seasons
And I'm breathing out the new me

With the nunchucks
Rolling in your hood
Ask a big bad wolf "what is good?"
Feeling dumbstruck
I done been there, done that
But I wonder why I still feel so alone

[Verse 1]
Baby, stand up
But don't pull them pants up
You're pulling off my shirt
But should I leave my hands up?
Expression of fandom
You know that I've been good
But you still tear the cat up
And when you provoke me
You do it at random
I won't lead you on
But I hope that you can manage
You don't want to man up
You don't want to plan up

[Verse 2]
But you call me wifey
So what's the big idea?
Do I need to sit right here and fill my ears
While bullshit come out of your lips? I hear
Got me searching for insight insight
Guess I need to call this night off
Riddle me, riddle me that
Mr. Unintentional Ass
And his every interval fast
Throw that cheese and dough in that bag
With that Little Italy swag
Nigga, riddle, riddle me that
Why my mental instantly crash when you enter, enter me?
Gentle then ya ease up
I'm day dreaming
But now, whoa, I never daydream
But you're jumping from rooftops
And searching and hunting, my ninja
Ooh, whoa, whoa, whoa

[Chorus]
With the nunchucks
Rolling in your hood
Ask a big bad wolf "what is good?"
Feeling dumbstruck
I done been there, done that
But I wonder why I still feel so alone
(I've been there, I've been there)
Rolling in your hood
Ask a big bad wolf "what is good?"
(I wonder why, I wonder why, I wonder why)
But I wonder why I still feel so alone
(I wonder why) I wonder why (I wonder why) I wonder why
(I wonder why) I wonder why (I wonder why)

Love had her shavin' it clean, but now that pussy on Wookie, boy

Not gon' fuck around, you had me fooled, thinkin' you not gon' slip

More, just a little bit more, just a little bit

[Verse 2]
Yeah, roll another hunnid
We could get the white girl lit like Madonna
Bitch, I ain't Gwen, but this shit is bananas
Sweating, make ya whole body drip like a sauna
Swim like your piranha, put M's in my water
I can't feel my lips, my limbs feel like rubber
Yeah, I came down, but I still need another
One under the tongue and then a little marijuana
They on the trees like koala

[Chorus]
I am addicted, a little
Under the influence, a little
And it makes me want to dance, a little
An itch I just can't scratch, addiction

[Post-Chorus]
Look
I'm just a little bit, I'm just a little bit (Oh na na na, na, na, na na)
I'm just a little bit, I'm just a little bit

Take it off, follow me now, let me in, don't shut me out
Don't tell me you love me if that's not how it really is
Take it off, follow me now, let me in, don't shut me out
Don't tell me you love me if that's not how it really is

[Chorus]
Is it casual?
Or are you tryna spend your life with me?
I don't mean to pressure you
But I want a man to stand and fight, stand and fight for me

[Verse 1]
You don't need to paint me a sweet fantasy
We chill, I kick back, you roll up my weed
Say what you feel, don't just say anything
Why complicate what could be so easy?
Leave me alone
If you is a player, I don't think I'ma play with you, uh-uh
This shit get old
If you wanna lay with her, why don't you just stay with her?

[Pre-Chorus]
You say you don't want a girlfriend but when we are in person
You always act so different, you make it all seem perfect
You hold me when we wake up, say you like me with no makeup
I'm tryin' to be patient, how am I supposed to take it?

[Chorus]
Is it casual?
Or are you tryna spend your life with me?
I don't mean to pressure you
But I want a man to stand and fight for me
Is it casual?
Or are you tryna spend your life with me?
I don't mean to pressure you
But I want a man to stand and fight, stand and fight for me

[Verse 2]
I'm sick of chillin', sippin' on Tecate
That life is a bore, we needed more than drunken Fridays
I'm not dissin' your freedom, I know you like to party
Just don't be that boy who fuck with anything that gyrate
I know you know I'm right, pick up on the vibe
If you read between the lines, bein' shy just ain't my style, now

[Pre-Chorus]
You say you don't want a girlfriend but when we are in person
You always act so different, you make it all seem perfect
You hold me when we wake up, say you like me with no makeup
I'm trying to be patient, how am I supposed to take it?

[Chorus]
Is it casual?
Or are you tryna spend your life with me?
I don't mean to pressure you
But I want a man to stand and fight for me
Is it casual?
Or are you tryna spend your life with me?
I don't mean to pressure you
But I want a man to stand and fight, stand and fight for me

[Bridge]
If you wanna be the one
Don't act sad and wait
And waste my day
I'm not that way

[Chorus]
Is it casual?
Or are you tryna spend your life with me?
I don't mean to pressure you
But I want a man to stand and fight for me
Is it casual?
Spend your life with me
Pressure you
But I want a man to stand and fight, stand and fight for me[Intro]
Gimme your damn money!

Bitch, I'm annual flossing, VVS
Yeah, I play Animal Crossing, GameCube, 3DS

Used to play Sims 4
Put a lil' wall 'round niggas, take the door off
Trap 'em in the swimmin' pool
I don't play Fortnite, fuck that
Chun-Li when I street fight, bust back
You ain't got combos, what's that?
Rock bitches on Mortal Kombat (Finish her)
It's tricky to rock a rhyme
Merk bitches on SSX
Leave bitches all bald like Seeiah
Mic check 'em like "test, test, test"
I remember my downward spiral
Back when I was playin' Spyro
When I never went out and lied low
Way before my lil' ass went viral
Super Smash Bros, you so ass though
Prolly pick Kirby so you don't get smashed on

[Pre-Chorus]
Shake that ass, ho
Shake that ass, ho

[Verse 2]
Master of mine craft, never played Minecraft
Look how my mind craft things
Be on my Halo teams
Look at my Sonic rings
Ahooga, don't push me
I "hadouken," hear the toasty?
Donkey Kong when he drum on that pussy
I don't play but I sure ain't no rookie
Steal a nigga like a bandit, boo
Then spend every penny of his bands and loot
Now she think that I'm the devil like a bandicoot
Wawawawawawa what you wanna do?
Yo, can I get it, get it yah?

[Chorus]
Can I get a hell yeah?

Can I get a hell yeah, yeah, yeah?

And we both got it in on freak
We ain't afraid of sexuality, oh

[Verse 1]
No games, no way, Jos
Foreplay, don't fake both ways
Like Olay, and I won't chase to it, OJ
Soul based, and I'm on face like I'm Colgate
Hallways when I go all day, get it (Uh-huh)
Now it's the one to throw it back with it
Fittin' all that, he ain't gotta call back
Trippin' this, prison this, nigga I don't get it, I'm addicted
Reading all my feelings, need a one-way ticket
Looking so fly 'cause I mind my business
Self-proposed but you know I'm vicious
Slow your roll, you can't lie to me, baby
I see it all in your eyes and your face
Want these knees to go opposite ways
And I see you fiendin', go off on it, babe
I don't need to speak, I'm not talkin', babe

[Chorus]
'Cause you're talkin' with your body, body
Can we touch up on that topic, topic?

[Verse 2]
You're coming on to me
And I can read it all up on your face
Control it, get your way
Baby, you can't hide from me
Come and vibe with me
Boy, it ain't my fault, it's building up inside of me
I hope I can get you out before you say goodbye to me
And boy, it ain't my fault, it's building up inside of me
I hope I can get you out before you say goodbye to me

Good self control but you stickin' it out
A figure of mouth, don't wonder why you twistin' your loud
She twerkin' it out and wonder why they thirstier now
Every night dodgin' broke niggas, curvin' 'em out
Like every pipe got its own feelings lurkin' below
I mean, really? Do you love me? Is it certain, for sure?
I got money, nigga, know you gon' be hurt if I don't
But I got niggas in my city and my bitches is cold, so

[Interlude]
Tell me what you had in mind
Watch it closely, we'll unwind
Psychology of the mind
You do your job, I'll do mine
'Cause the body doesn't lie

'Cause you're talkin' with your body, body
Can we touch up on that topic, topic?
'Cause you're talkin' with your body, body

One week in we let the story begin
We're going out on our first date
You and me are thrifty, so go all you can eat
Fill up your bag and I fill up a plate
We talk for hours and hours about the sweet and the sour
And how your family is doing okay
Leave and get in a taxi, then kiss in the backseat
Tell the driver make the radio play, and I'm singing like

[Pre-Chorus]
Girl, you know I want your love
Your love was handmade for somebody like me
Come on now, follow my lead
I may be crazy, don't mind me
Say, boy, let's not talk too much
Grab on my waist and put that body on me
Come on now, follow my lead
Come, come on now, follow my lead

[Chorus]
I'm in love with the shape of you
We push and pull like a magnet do
Although my heart is falling too
I'm in love with your body
And last night you were in my room
And now my bed sheets smell like you
Every day discovering something brand new
I'm in love with your body
OhIohIohIohI
I'm in love with your body
OhIohIohIohI
I'm in love with your body
OhIohIohIohI
I'm in love with your body
Every day discovering something brand new
I'm in love with the shape of you

[Bridge]
Come on, be my baby, come on
Come on, be my baby, come on
Come on, be my baby, come on
Come on, be my baby, come on
Come on, be my baby, come on
Come on, be my baby, come on
Come on, be my baby, come on
Come on, be my baby, come on

[Chorus]
I'm in love with the shape of you
We push and pull like a magnet do
Although my heart is falling too
I'm in love with your body
Last night you were in my room
And now my bed sheets smell like you
Every day discovering something brand new
I'm in love with your body
Come on, be my baby, come on
Come on, be my baby, come on
I'm in love with your body
Come on, be my baby, come on
Come on, be my baby, come on
I'm in love with your body
Come on, be my baby, come on
Come on, be my baby, come on
I'm in love with your body
Every day discovering something brand new
I'm in love with the shape of you[Verse 1]
I found a love for me
Oh darling, just dive right in and follow my lead
Well, I found a girl, beautiful and sweet
Oh, I never knew you were the someone waiting for me
'Cause we were just kids when we fell in love
Not knowing what it was
I will not give you up this time
But darling, just kiss me slow, your heart is all I own
And in your eyes, you're holding mine

[Chorus]
Baby, I'm dancing in the dark with you between my arms
Barefoot on the grass, listening to our favourite song
When you said you looked a mess, I whispered underneath my breath
But you heard it, darling, you look perfect tonight

[Verse 2]
Well I found a woman, stronger than anyone I know
She shares my dreams, I hope that someday I'll share her home
I found a love, to carry more than just my secrets
To carry love, to carry children of our own
We are still kids, but we're so in love
Fighting against all odds
I know we'll be alright this time
Darling, just hold my hand
Be my girl, I'll be your man
I see my future in your eyes

[Chorus 2]
Baby, I'm dancing in the dark, with you between my arms
Barefoot on the grass, listening to our favorite song
When I saw you in that dress, looking so beautiful
I don't deserve this, darling, you look perfect tonight

[Instrumental]

[Chorus 3]
Baby, I'm dancing in the dark, with you between my arms
Barefoot on the grass, listening to our favorite song
I have faith in what I see
Now I know I have met an angel in person
And she looks perfect
I don't deserve this
You look perfect tonight[Verse 1]
When I was six years old I broke my leg
I was running from my brother and his friends
And tasted the sweet perfume of the mountain grass I rolled down
I was younger then, take me back to when I

[Pre-Chorus]
Found my heart and broke it here
Made friends and lost them through the years
And I've not seen the roaring fields in so long, I know I've grown
But I can't wait to go home

[Chorus]
I'm on my way
Driving at 90 down those country lanes
Singing to "Tiny Dancer"
And I miss the way you make me feel, and it's real
We watched the sunset over the castle on the hill

[Verse 2]
Fifteen years old and smoking hand-rolled cigarettes
Running from the law through the backfields and getting drunk with my friends
Had my first kiss on a Friday night, I don't reckon that I did it right
But I was younger then, take me back to when

[Pre-Chorus]
We found weekend jobs, when we got paid
We'd buy cheap spirits and drink them straight
Me and my friends have not thrown up in so long, oh how we've grown
But I can't wait to go home

[Chorus]
I'm on my way
Driving at 90 down those country lanes
Singing to "Tiny Dancer"
And I miss the way you make me feel, and it's real
We watched the sunset over the castle on the hill
Over the castle on the hill
Over the castle on the hill

[Bridge]
One friend left to sell clothes
One works down by the coast
One had two kids but lives alone
One's brother overdosed
One's already on his second wife
One's just barely getting by
But these people raised me
And I can't wait to go home

[Chorus]
And I'm on my way, I still remember
These old country lanes
When we did not know the answers
And I miss the way you make me feel, it's real
We watched the sunset over the castle on the hill
Over the castle on the hill
Over the castle on the hill[Verse 1]
Walking down 29th and park
I saw you in another's arm
Only a month we've been apart
You look happier
Saw you walk inside a bar
He said something to make you laugh
I saw that both your smiles were twice as wide as ours
Yeah, you look happier, you do

[Pre-Chrous]
Ain't nobody hurt you like I hurt you
But ain't nobody love you like I do
Promise that I will not take it personal, baby
If you're moving on with someone new

[Chorus]
'Cause baby you look happier, you do
My friends told me one day I'll feel it too
And until then I'll smile to hide the truth
But I know I was happier with you

[Verse 2]
Sat in the corner of the room
Everything's reminding me of you
Nursing an empty bottle and telling myself
You're happier, aren't you?

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Oh, ain't nobody hurt you like I hurt you
But ain't nobody need you like I do
I know that there's others that deserve you
But my darling, I am still in love with you

[Chorus 2]
But I guess you look happier, you do
My friends told me one day Ill feel it too
I could try to smile to hide the truth
But I know I was happier with you

[Outro]
Cause baby you look happier, you do
I knew one day youd fall for someone new
But if he breaks your heart like lovers do
Just know that Ill be waiting here for you[Verse 1]
I took the supermarket flowers from the windowsill
I threw the day old tea from the cup
Packed up the photo album Matthew had made
Memories of a life that's been loved
Took the get well soon cards and stuffed animals
Poured the old ginger beer down the sink
Dad always told me, "Don't you cry when you're down"
But mum, there's a tear every time that I blink

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, I'm in pieces, it's tearing me up, but I know
A heart that's broke is a heart that's been loved

[Chorus]
So I'll sing Hallelujah
You were an angel in the shape of my mum
When I fell down you'd be there holding me up
Spread your wings as you go
When God takes you back
He'll say, "Hallelujah, you're home"

[Verse 2]
I fluffed the pillows, made the beds, stacked the chairs up
Folded your nightgowns neatly in a case
John says he'd drive then put his hand on my cheek
And wiped a tear from the side of my face

[Pre-Chorus]
I hope that I see the world as you did 'cause I know
A life with love is a life that's been lived

[Chorus]
So I'll sing Hallelujah
You were an angel in the shape of my mum
When I fell down you'd be there holding me up
Spread your wings as you go
When God takes you back
He'll say, "Hallelujah, you're home"

[Outro/Chorus]
Hallelujah
You were an angel in the shape of my mum
You got to see the person I have become
Spread your wings and I know
That when God took you back
He said, "Hallelujah, you're home"[Chorus]
She played the fiddle in an Irish band
But she fell in love with an English man
Kissed her on the neck and then I took her by the hand
Said, "Baby, I just want to dance"

[Verse 1]
I met her on Grafton street right outside of the bar
She shared a cigarette with me while her brother played the guitar
She asked me what does it mean, the Gaelic ink on your arm?
Said it was one of my friend's songs, do you want to drink on?
She took Jamie as a chaser, Jack for the fun
She got Arthur on the table with Johnny riding a shotgun
Chatted some more, one more drink at the bar
Then put Van on the jukebox, got up to dance

[Chorus]
You know, she played the fiddle in an Irish band
But she fell in love with an English man
Kissed her on the neck and then I took her by the hand
Said, "Baby, I just want to dance"
With my pretty little Galway Girl
You're my pretty little Galway Girl

[Verse 2]
You know she beat me at darts and then she beat me at pool
And then she kissed me like there was nobody else in the room
As last orders were called was when she stood on the stool
After dancing the cili singing to trad tunes
I never heard Carrickfergus ever sung so sweet
A cappella in the bar using her feet for a beat
Oh, I could have that voice playing on repeat for a week
And in this packed out room swear she was singing to me

[Chorus]
You know, she played the fiddle in an Irish band
But she fell in love with an English man
Kissed her on the neck and then I took her by the hand
Said, "Baby, I just want to dance"
My pretty little Galway Girl
My, my, my, my, my, my, my Galway Girl
My, my, my, my, my, my, my Galway Girl
My, my, my, my, my, my, my Galway Girl

[Verse 3]
And now we've outstayed our welcome and it's closing time
I was holding her hand, her hand was holding mine
Our coats both smell of smoke, whisky and wine
As we fill up our lungs with the cold air of the night
I walked her home then she took me inside
To finish some Doritos and another bottle of wine
I swear I'm gonna put you in a song that I write
About a Galway Girl and a perfect night

[Chorus]
She played the fiddle in an Irish band
But she fell in love with an English man
Kissed her on the neck and then I took her by the hand
Said, "Baby, I just want to dance"
My pretty little Galway Girl
My, my, my, my, my, my, my Galway Girl
My, my, my, my, my, my, my Galway Girl
My, my, my, my, my, my, my Galway Girl[Verse 1]
When your legs don't work like they used to before
And I can't sweep you off of your feet
Will your mouth still remember the taste of my love?
Will your eyes still smile from your cheeks?
And darling, I will be loving you till we're seventy
And baby, my heart could still fall as hard at twenty-three
And I'm thinking 'bout how

[Pre-Chorus 1]
People fall in love in mysterious ways
Maybe just the touch of a hand
Well me, I fall in love with you every single day
I just wanna tell you I am

[Chorus]
So honey, now, take me into your loving arms
Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars
Place your head on my beating heart, I'm thinking out loud
And maybe we found love right where we are

[Verse 2]
When my hair's all but gone and my memory fades
And the crowds don't remember my name
When my hands don't play the strings the same way
I know you will still love me the same
'Cause, honey, your soul could never grow old, it's evergreen
And baby, your smile's forever in my mind and memory
And I'm thinking 'bout how

[Pre-Chorus 2]
People fall in love in mysterious ways
And maybe it's all part of a plan
Well I'll just keep on making the same mistakes
Hoping that you'll understand

[Chorus]
That, baby, now, take me into your loving arms
Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars
Place your head on my beating heart, I'm thinking out loud
And maybe we found love right where we are

[Chorus]
So baby, now, take me into your loving arms
Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars
Oh darling, place your head on my beating heart, I'm thinking out loud
That maybe we found love right where we are
Oh baby, we found love right where we are
And we found love right where we are[Verse 1]
Oh, maybe I came on too strong
Maybe I waited too long
Maybe I played my cards wrong
Oh, just a little bit wrong
Baby I apologize for it

[Pre-Chorus]
I could fall, or I could fly
Here in your aeroplane
And I could live, I could die
Hanging on the words you say
And I've been known to give my all
And jumping in harder than
Ten thousand rocks on the lake

[Chorus]
So don't call me baby
Unless you mean it
And don't tell me you need me
If you don't believe it
So let me know the truth
Before I dive right into you

[Verse 2]
You're a mystery
I've travelled the world
And there's no other girl like you
No one, what's your history? (What's your history?)
Do you have a tendency to lead some people on?
'Cause I heard you do, mmm

[Pre-Chorus]
I could fall, or I could fly
Here in your aeroplane
And I could live, I could die
Hanging on the words you say
And I've been known to give my all
And lie awake, every day
Don't know how much I can take

[Chorus]
So don't call me baby
Unless you mean it
Don't tell me you need me
If you don't believe it
So let me know the truth
Before I dive right into you

[Guitar Solo]

[Pre-Chorus]
I could fall, or I could fly
Here in your aeroplane
And I could live, I could die
Hanging on the words you say
And I've been known to give my all
Sitting back, looking at
Every mess that I made

[Chorus]
So don't call me baby
Unless you mean it
Don't tell me you need me
If you don't believe it
Let me know the truth
Before I dive right into you
Before I dive right into you
Before I dive right into you[Verse 1]
Loving can hurt, loving can hurt sometimes
But it's the only thing that I know
When it gets hard, you know it can get hard sometimes
It is the only thing that makes us feel alive

[Pre-Chorus]
We keep this love in a photograph
We made these memories for ourselves
Where our eyes are never closing
Our hearts were never broken
And time's forever frozen, still

[Chorus]
So you can keep me
Inside the pocket of your ripped jeans
Holding me close until our eyes meet
You won't ever be alone, wait for me to come home

[Verse 2]
Loving can heal, loving can mend your soul
And it's the only thing that I know, know
I swear it will get easier, remember that with every piece of ya
And it's the only thing to take with us when we die

[Pre-Chorus]
We keep this love in a photograph
We made these memories for ourselves
Where our eyes are never closing
Our hearts were never broken
And time's forever frozen, still

[Chorus]
So you can keep me
Inside the pocket of your ripped jeans
Holding me close until our eyes meet
You won't ever be alone
And if you hurt me, that's okay, baby
Only words bleed inside these pages, you just hold me
And I won't ever let you go
Wait for me to come home

[Bridge]
Wait for me to come home
Wait for me to come home
Wait for me to come home

[Chorus]
Oh, you can fit me
Inside the necklace you got when you were 16
Next to your heartbeat where I should be
Keep it deep within your soul
And if you hurt me, that's okay, baby
Only words bleed inside these pages
You just hold me
And I won't ever let you go

[Outro]
When I'm away, I will remember how you kissed me
Under the lamppost back on Sixth street
Hearing you whisper through the phone
"Wait for me to come home"[Verse 1]
I met this girl late last year
She said, "Don't you worry if I disappear"
I told her I'm not really looking for another mistake
I called an old friend thinking that the trouble would wait
But then I jumped right in a week later, returned
I reckon she was only looking for a lover to burn
But I gave her my time for two or three nights
Then I put it on pause until the moment was right
I went away for months until our paths crossed again
She told me, "I was never looking for a friend
Maybe you could swing by my room around ten
Baby, bring the lemon and a bottle of gin
We'll be in between the sheets till the late AM"
Baby, if you wanted me then you should have just said, she's singing

[Chorus]
Don't fuck with my love
That heart is so cold
All over my home
I don't wanna know that babe
Don't fuck with my love
I told her she knows
Take aim and reload
I don't wanna know that babe

[Verse 2]
And for a couple weeks I only wanna see her
We drink away the days with a takeaway pizza
Before a text message was the only way to reach her
Now she's staying at my place and loves the way I treat her
Singing out Aretha, all over the track like a feature
And never wants to sleep, I guess that I don't want to either
But me and her, we make money the same way
Four cities, two planes, the same day
And those shows have never been what it's about
But maybe we'll go together and just figure it out
I'd rather put on a film with you and sit on a couch
But we should get on a plane or we'll be missing it now
Wish I'd have written it down, the way that things played out
When she was kissing him, how I was confused about
Now she should figure it out, while I'm sat here singing

[Chorus]
Don't fuck with my love
That heart is so cold
All over my home
I don't wanna know that babe
Don't fuck with my love
I told her she knows
Take aim and reload
I don't wanna know that babe

[Verse 3]
(Knock, knock, knock) on my hotel door
I don't even know if she knows what for
She was crying on my shoulder, I already told ya
Trust and respect is what we do this for
I never intended to be next (You bastard)
But you didn't need to take him to bed, that's all
And I never saw him as a threat (You bastard)
Until you disappeared with him to have sex, of course
It's not like we were both on tour
We were staying on the same fucking hotel floor
And I wasn't looking for a promise or commitment
But it was never just fun, and I thought you were different
This is not the way you realised what you wanted
It's a bit too much, too late if I'm honest
And all this time, God knows I'm singing

[Chorus]
Don't fuck with my love
That heart is so cold
All over my home
I don't wanna know that babe
Don't fuck with my love
I told her she knows
Take aim and reload
I don't wanna know that babe
Don't fuck with my love
That heart is so cold
All over my home
I don't wanna know that babe
Don't fuck with my love
I told her she knows
Take aim and reload
I don't wanna know that babe[Verse 1]
White lips, pale face
Breathing in the snowflakes
Burnt lungs, sour taste
Light's gone, days end
Struggling to pay rent
Long nights, strange men

[Pre-Chorus]
And they say
She's in the Class A Team
Stuck in her daydream
Been this way since 18
But lately, her face seems
Slowly sinking, wasting
Crumbling like pastries
And they scream
The worst things in life come free to us

[Chorus]
'Cause we're just under the upper hand
And go mad for a couple grams
And she don't want to go outside tonight
And in a pipe she flies to the Motherland
Or sells love to another man
It's too cold outside
For angels to fly
Angels to fly

[Verse 2]
Ripped gloves, raincoat
Tried to swim and stay afloat
Dry house, wet clothes
Loose change, bank notes
Weary-eyed, dry throat
Call girl, no phone

[Pre-Chorus]
And they say
She's in the Class A Team
Stuck in her daydream
Been this way since 18
But lately, her face seems
Slowly sinking, wasting
Crumbling like pastries
And they scream
The worst things in life come free to us

[Chorus]
'Cause we're just under the upper hand
And go mad for a couple grams
And she don't want to go outside tonight
And in a pipe she flies to the Motherland
Or sells love to another man
It's too cold outside
For angels to fly

[Bridge]
An angel will die
Covered in white
Closed eyes and hopin' for a better life
This time, we'll fade out tonight
Straight down the line

[Pre-Chorus]
And they say
She's in the Class A Team
Stuck in her daydream
Been this way since 18
But lately, her face seems
Slowly sinking, wasting
Crumbling like pastries
And they scream
The worst things in life come free to us

[Chorus]
And we're all under the upper hand
And go mad for a couple grams
And we don't want to go outside tonight
And in a pipe we fly to the Motherland
Or sell love to another man
It's too cold outside
For angels to fly
Angels to fly
Fly, fly
For angels to fly
To fly, to fly
For angels to die[Verse 1: Ed Sheeran]
She got the mmm, brown eyes, caramel thighs
Long hair, no wedding ring, hey
I saw you lookin' from across the way
And now I really wanna know your name
She got the mmm, white dress, but when shes wearin' less
Man, you know that she drives me crazy
The mmm, brown eyes, beautiful smile
You know I love watching you do your thing

[Pre-Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
I love her hips, curves, lips say the words
"Te amo, mami, ah, te amo, mami"
I kiss her, this love is like a dream

[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
So join me in this bed that I'm in
Push up on me and sweat, darling
So Im gonna put my time in

Jump in that water, be free
Come south of the border with me
Jump in that water, be free
Come south of the border with me

[Verse 2: Camila Cabello]
He got that mmm, green eyes, givin' me signs
That he really wants to know my namehey

Quiero sentir tu cuerpo en m, ests temblando
Mmm, green eyes, takin' your time
Now we know we'll never be the same

[Pre-Chorus: Camila Cabello]
I love his lips 'cause he says the words
"Te amo, mami, ah, te amo, mami"
Dont wake up, this love is like a dream

[Chorus: Ed Sheeran & Camila Cabello, Ed Sheeran, Camila Cabello]
So join me in this bed that Im in
Push up on me and sweat, darling
So I'm gonna put my time in (Time in)
And wont stop until the angels sing
Jump in that water, be free
Come south of the border with me
Jump in that water, be free
Come south of the border with me (Rrrat)
Flawless diamonds
In a green field near Buenos Aires
Until the sun's rising
We won't stop until the angels sing
Jump in that water, be free
Come south of the border with me
Jump in that water, be free
Come south of the border with me

[Verse 3: Cardi B & Camila Cabello]
Bardi, uh
You never live 'til you risk your life (Life)
You wanna shine, you gotta get more ice (Ice, ice, oh)
Am I your lover or Im just your vice? (Woo, yeah, yeah)
A little crazy, but I'm just your type (Okurrr)
You want the lips and the curves, need the whips and the furs
And the diamonds I prefer, in my closet, his and hers, ayy
He want the lil' mamacita, margarita (Margarita)
I think that Ed got a lil' jungle fever, ayy (Woo!)
You are more than (You are more than)
Something borin' (Something borin')
Legs open, tongue out, Michael Jordan, uh (Uh)
Go explore in (Woo, woo) somethin' foreign (Skrrt, skrrt)
Bust it up, a rain forest, it be pourin', yeah
Kiss me like you need me, rub me like a genie
Pull up to my spot in Lamborghini
'Cause you gotta see me, never leave me (Never leave me)
You got a girl that could finally do it all
Drop a album, drop a baby, but I never drop the ball, uh

[Chorus: Ed Sheeran, Camila Cabello & Both]
So join me in this bed (This bed) that I'm in (That I'm in)
Push up on me and sweat, darling (Oh no, no, no)
So I'm gonna put my time in
I won't stop until the angels sing (Nah, nah, nah)
Jump in that water, be free
Come south of the border with me
Come south of the border, border (Hey)
Come south of the border with me
Come south of the border, border
Come south of the border with me
Jump in that water, be free
Come south of the border with me
Jump in that water, be free
Come south of the border with me[Verse 1]
I was born inside a small town, I lost that state of mind
Learned to sing inside the Lord's house, but stopped the age of nine
I forget when I get awards now the wave I had to ride
The paving stones I played upon that kept me on the grind
So blame it on the pain that blessed me with the life
Friends and family filled with envy when they should be filled with pride
And when the world's against me is when I really come alive
And every day that Satan tempts me, I try to take it in my stride
You know that I've got whisky with white lies, and smoke in my lungs
I think life has got to the point, I know without it's no fun
I need to get in the right mind, and clear myself up
Instead, I look in the mirror questioning what I've become
Guess it's a stereotypical day for someone like me
Without a nine-to-five job or a uni degree
To be caught up in the trappings of the industry
Show me the locked doors, I'll find another use for the key
And you'll see

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm well aware of certain things that can destroy a man like me
But with that said give me one more

[Chorus]
Another one to take the sting away
I am happy on my own, so here I'll stay
Save your lovin' arms for a rainy day
And I'll find comfort in my pain eraser

[Verse 2]
I used to think that nothing could be better than touring the world with my songs
I chased the pictured perfect life, I think they painted it wrong
I think that money is the root of all evil, and fame is hell
Relationships, and hearts you fixed, they break as well
And ain't nobody wanna see you down in the dumps
Because you're living your dream, man, this shit should be fun
Please know that I'm not trying to preach like I'm Reverend Run
I beg you, don't be disappointed with the man I've become
Conversations with my father on the A14
Age 12 telling me I've gotta chase those dreams
Now I'm playing for the people, dad, and they know me
With my beaten small guitar, wearing the same old jeans
Wembley Stadium crowd's 240 thou'
I may have grown up, but I hope that Damian's proud
And to the next generation, inspiration's allowed
The world may be filled with hate, but keep erasing it now
Somehow

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm well aware of certain things that will befall a man like me
But with that said give me one more

[Chorus]
Another one to take the sting away
Oh, I am happy on my own, so here I'll stay
Save your lovin' arms for a rainy day
And I'll find comfort in my pain eraser
And I'll find comfort in my pain eraser
And I'll find comfort in my pain eraser

[Bridge]
Welcome to the new show
I guess you know I've been away
But where I'm heading, who knows?
But my heart will stay the same
Welcome to the new show
I guess you know I've been away
But where I'm heading, who knows?
My pain eraser

[Chorus]
And I'll find comfort in my pain eraser
And I'll find comfort in my pain eraser
And I'll find comfort in my pain eraser
And I'll find comfort in my pain eraser[Intro: Ed Sheeran]
We are, we are, we are

[Verse 1: Ed Sheeran]
L.A. on a Saturday night in the summer
Sundown and they all come out
Lamborghinis and their rented Hummers
The party's on, so they're headin' downtown ('Round here)
Everybody's lookin' for a come up
And they wanna know what you're about
Me in the middle with the one I love and
We're just tryna figure everything out

[Pre-Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
We don't fit in well 'cause we are just ourselves
I could use some help gettin' out of this conversation, yeah
You look stunning, dear, so don't ask that question here
This is my only fear: that we become

[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
Beautiful people
Drop top, designer clothes
Front row at fashion shows
"What d'you do?" and "Who d'you know?"
Inside the world of beautiful people
Champagne and rolled-up notes
Prenups and broken homes
Surrounded, but still alone
Let's leave the party

[Post-Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
That's not who we are (We are, we are, we are)
We are not beautiful
Yeah, that's not who we are (We are, we are, we are)
We are not beautiful (Beautiful)

[Verse 2: Khalid]
L.A., mmm
Drove for hours last night and we made it nowhere (Nowhere, nowhere)
I see stars in your eyes when we're halfway there (All night)
I'm not fazed by all them lights and flashin' cameras
'Cause with my arms around you, there's no need to care

[Pre-Chorus: Khalid]
We don't fit in well, we are just ourselves
I could use some help gettin' out of this conversation, yeah
You look stunning, dear, so don't ask that question here
This is my only fear: that we become

[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
Beautiful people
Drop top, designer clothes
Front row at fashion shows
"What d'you do?" and "Who d'you know?"
Inside the world of beautiful people
Champagne and rolled-up notes
Prenups and broken homes
Surrounded, but still alone
Let's leave the party

[Post-Chorus: Ed Sheeran, Both, Khalid]
That's not who we are (We are, we are, we are)
We are not beautiful, yeah
Yeah, that's not who we are (We are, we are, we are)
We are not beautiful (Beautiful)

[Outro: Ed Sheeran]
We are, we are, we are
We are not beautiful[Intro]
Oh misty eye of the mountain below
Keep careful watch of my brothers' souls
And should the sky be filled with fire and smoke
Keep watching over Durin's sons

[Verse 1]
If this is to end in fire, then we should all burn together
Watch the flames climb high into the night
Calling out father oh, stand by and we will
Watch the flames burn auburn on the mountain side

[Verse 2]
And if we should die tonight, we should all die together
Raise a glass of wine for the last time
Calling out father oh, prepare as we will
Watch the flames burn auburn on the mountain side
Desolation comes upon the sky

[Chorus]
Now I see fire, inside the mountain
I see fire, burning the trees
And I see fire, hollowing souls
I see fire, blood in the breeze
And I hope that you remember me

[Verse 3]
Oh, should my people fall then surely I'll do the same
Confined in mountain halls, we got too close to the flame
Calling out father oh, hold fast and we will
Watch the flames burn auburn on the mountain side
Desolation comes upon the sky

[Chorus]
Now I see fire, inside the mountain
I see fire, burning the trees
And I see fire, hollowing souls
I see fire, blood in the breeze
And I hope that you remember me

[Bridge]
And if the night is burning, I will cover my eyes
For if the dark returns then my brothers will die
And as the sky's falling down it crashed into this lonely town
And with that shadow upon the ground I hear my people screaming out

[Outro]
Now I see fire, inside the mountain
I see fire, burning the trees
I see fire, hollowing souls
I see fire, blood in the breeze
I see fire (oh you know I saw a city burning out)
I see fire (feel the heat upon my skin)
I see fire
And I see fire burn auburn on the mountainside[Verse 1: Ed Sheeran]
Yeah, I was born a misfit
Grew up 10 miles from the town of Ipswich
Wanted to make it big, I wished it to existence
I never was a sick kid, always dismissed quick
"Stick to singing, stop rappin' like it's Christmas"
And if you're talkin' money, then my conversation's shiftin'
My dreams are bigger than just bein' on the rich list
Might be insanity, but people call it "gifted"
My face is goin' numb from the shit this stuff is mixed with
Watch how the lyrics in the songs might get twisted
My wife wears red, but looks better without the lipstick
I'm a private guy and you know nothin' 'bout my business
And if I had my 15 minutes, I must have missed 'em
20 years old is when I came in the game
And now it's eight years on and you remember the name
And if you thought I was good, well, then I'm better today
But it's ironic how you people thought I'd never be great
I like my shows open-air, Tokyo to Delaware
Put your phones in the air if you wanna be rocked
You know I want way more than I already got
Give me a song with Eminem and 50 Cent in the club

[Chorus: Ed Sheeran & 50 Cent]
You know it ain't my time to call it a day
I wanna crack on and I wanna be paid
But it's 'bout time you remember the name
Ayy, ayy
You know it ain't my time to call it a day
I wanna crack on and I wanna be paid
But it's 'bout time you remember the name
Ayy, ayy
(Hey, hey, hey)

[Verse 2: Eminem]
I can still remember (What?) tryna shop a deal (Uh-huh)
From Taco Bell to TRL
I climbed the Billboard charts to the top until
As fate would have it (Yeah), became an addict
Funny 'cause I had pop appeal
But they said time would tell (What?) if I'd prevail (Huh?)
And all I did was (What?) put nine-inch nails (Where?)
In my eyelids now (What?)
I'm seein' diamond sales like I'm in Zales (Yeah)
Without a doubt, by any means
If rap was skinny jeans, I couldn't do anything in 'em
I'd be splitting seams of denim when I'm spitting schemes
Which really means, no "if," "ands," or "buts" are squeezin' in between
You sleep on me 'cause you're only fuckin' with me in your dreams
Not even when I'm on my deathbed
Man, I feel like Ed, it isn't time to drop the mic yet
So why would I quit?
The thought that I would stop when I'm dead
Just popped in my head
I said it, then forgot what I said

[Chorus: Ed Sheeran & Eminem]
It isn't my time to call it a day
I got rap locked and I'm already paid
But it's 'bout time you remember the name
Ayy, ayy
You know it ain't my time to call it a day
I got rap locked and I'm already paid
But it's 'bout time you remember the name
Ayy, ayy

[Verse 3: 50 Cent]
Ain't nobody cold as me, I dress so fresh, so clean
You can find me in my whip, rockin' my Fendi drip
Man, you know just what I mean
Shinin', wrist with the rocks on it, Buscemis with locks on it
Everything my voice on, this shit knock, don't it?
Balenciaga saga, I'm in Bergdorf ballin'
It's just another episode, my hoes, I spoil 'em
She like the fly shit and I like to buy shit
Shit, I'm gettin' stupid money, what else we gon' do with money?
Bitch, we be ballin' out, the king bring you 50 bottles
Tonight, we gon' blow a check, worry 'bout your shit tomorrow
The turn up be so real, we 'bout to be super lit
Boy, I'm kickin' straight facts, that's just how we do this shit
Tomorrow, we hangin' over 'til we start feelin' sober
Then it's time to start it over, here we go again

[Chorus: Ed Sheeran & Eminem, 50 Cent]
You know it ain't my time to call it a day
I got rap locked and I'm already paid
And it's about time you remember the name
Ayy, ayy
You know it ain't my time to call it a day
I got rap locked and I'm already paid
But it's 'bout time you remember the name
Ayy, ayy
(Hey, hey, hey)[Intro]
Nah nah nah nah nah

[Verse 1]
I heard he spent five hundred pounds on jeans
Goes to the gym at least six times a week
Wears boat shoes with no socks on his feet
And I hear he's on a new diet and watches what he eats
He's got his eyebrows plucked and his arsehole bleached
Owns every single Ministry CD
Tribal tattoos and he don't know what it means
But I heard he makes you happy, so that's fine by me
But still, I'm just keepin' it real
Still lookin' at your Instagram and I'll be creepin' a lil'
I'll be tryin' not to double tap, from way back
'Cause I know that's where the trouble's at
Let me remind you of the days when
You used to hold my hand
And when we sipped champagne out of cider cans
I guess if you were Lois Lane, I wasn't Superman
Just a young boy tryin' to be loved
So let me give it to ya

[Chorus]
I don't wanna know about your new man
'Cause if it was meant to be
You wouldn't be callin' me up tryin' to
'Cause I'm positive that he don't wanna know about me
I don't wanna know about your new man
We'll get there eventually
I know you're missin' all this kind of love
But I'm positive that he don't wanna know about me

[Verse 2]
Your new man rents a house in the 'burb
And wears a man bag on his shoulder, but I call it a purse
Every year, he goes to Mlaga with all the fellas
Drinks beer, but has a six pack, I'm kinda jealous
He wears sunglasses indoors, in winter, at nighttime
And every time a rap song comes on, he makes a gang sign
Says "Chune, bwoydem light up the room!"
But enough about him, girl, let's talk about you
You were the type of girl who sat beside the water readin'
Eatin' a packet of crisps, but you will never find you cheatin'
Now you're eatin' kale, hittin' the gym
Keepin' up with Kylie and Kim
In the back of the club, kissin' a boy that ain't him
Okay, you need to be alone
And if you wanna talk about it, you can call my phone
I just thought I would tell you, 'cause you oughta know
You're still a young girl tryin' to be loved
So let me give it to ya

[Chorus]
I don't wanna know about your new man
'Cause if it was meant to be
You wouldn't be callin' me up tryin' to
'Cause I'm positive that he don't wanna know about me
I don't wanna know about your new man
We'll get there eventually
I know you're missin' all this kind of love
But I'm positive that he don't wanna know about me

[Bridge]
Baby, I'm not tryin' to ruin your week
But you act so differently
When you're with him, I know you're lonely
Please remember you're still free
To make the choice and leave
Don't call me up, you need to show me

[Chorus]
I don't wanna know about your new man
'Cause if it was meant to be
You wouldn't be callin' me up tryin' to
'Cause I'm positive that he don't wanna know about me
I don't wanna know about your new man
We'll get there eventually
I know you're missin' all this kind of love
But I'm positive that he don't wanna know about me

[Outro]
But I'm positive that he don't wanna know about
But I'm positive that he don't wanna know about
I don't wanna know about your new man[Verse 1]
You are the one, girl
And you know that it's true
I'm feeling younger
Every time that I'm alone with you

[Pre-Chorus]
We were sitting in a parked car
Stealing kisses in a front yard
We got questions we should not ask, but

[Chorus]
How would you feel
If I told you I loved you?
It's just something that I want to do
I'll be taking my time
Spending my life
Falling deeper in love with you
So tell me that you love me too

[Verse 2]
In the summer
As the lilacs bloom
Love flows deeper than the river
Every moment that I spend with you

[Pre-Chorus]
We were sat upon our best friend's roof
I had both of my arms around you
Watching the sunrise replace the moon, but

[Chorus]
How would you feel
If I told you I loved you?
It's just something that I want to do
I'll be taking my time
Spending my life
Falling deeper in love with you
So tell me that you love me too

[Guitar Solo: John Mayer]

[Pre-Chorus]
Yeah, we were sitting in a parked car
Stealing kisses in a front yard
We got questions we should not ask

[Chorus]
How would you feel
If I told you I loved you?
It's just something that I want to do
I'll be taking my time
Spending my life
Falling deeper in love with you
Tell me that you love me too
Tell me that you love me too
Tell me that you love me too[Verse 1]
I was twenty-four years old
When I met the woman I would call my own
Twenty-two grand kids now growing old
In that house that your brother bought ya
On the summer day when I proposed
I made that wedding ring from dentist gold
And I asked her father, but her daddy said, "No
You can't marry my daughter"

[Chorus]
She and I went on the run
Don't care about religion
I'm gonna marry the woman I love
Down by the Wexford border
She was Nancy Mulligan
And I was William Sheeran
She took my name and then we were one
Down by the Wexford border

[Verse 2]
Well, I met her at Guy's in the second World War
And she was working on a soldier's ward
Never had I seen such beauty before
The moment that I saw her
Nancy was my yellow rose
And we got married wearing borrowed clothes
We got eight children, now growing old
Five sons and three daughters

[Chorus]
She and I went on the run
Don't care about religion
I'm gonna marry the woman I love
Down by the Wexford border
She was Nancy Mulligan
And I was William Sheeran
She took my name and then we were one
Down by the Wexford border

[Verse 3]
From her snow white streak in her jet black hair
Over sixty years I've been loving her
Now we're sat by the fire in our old armchairs
You know Nancy, I adore ya
From a farm boy born near Belfast town
I never worried about the king and crown
'Cause I found my heart upon the southern ground
There's no difference, I assure ya

[Chorus]
She and I went on the run
Don't care about religion
I'm gonna marry the woman I love
Down by the Wexford border
She was Nancy Mulligan
And I was William Sheeran
She took my name and then we were one
Down by the Wexford border[Verse 1]
Well get up, up on the dancefloor tonight
I've got two left feet and a bottle of red wine
Making me feel like the beat and the bassline
Are in my blood, both hands up on her waistline
Get on up, baby, dance to the rhythm of the music
Don't care what the DJ chooses
Get lost in the rhythm of me
Place don't close until we wanna leave it

[Chorus]
And you and I, we're flying on an aeroplane tonight
We're going, somewhere where the sun is shining bright
Just close your eyes
And let's pretend we're dancing in the street

[Hook]
In Barcelona
Barcelona
Barcelona
Barcelona

[Verse 2]
Well, get up, up on the dancefloor, move, it's a Saturday night
I fell in love with the sparkle in the moonlight
Reflected in your beautiful eyes
I guess that is destiny doing it right
And dance like they do in the Mediterranean
Spin you around me again and again, and
You're like something that God has sent me
I want you, baby, solamente

[Chorus]
And you and I, we're flying on an aeroplane tonight
We're going, somewhere where the sun is shining bright
Just close your eyes
And let's pretend we're dancing in the street

[Hook]
In Barcelona
Barcelona
Barcelona
Barcelona
Barcelona
Barcelona
Oh, Barcelona
So let's pretend we're dancing in the street
In Barcelona

[Verse 3]
Las Ramblas, I'll meet you
We'll dance around La Sagrada Familia (Barcelona)
Drinking Sangra
Mi nia, te amo mi cario (Barcelona)
Mamacita, rica
S t, te adoro, seorita (Barcelona)
Nosotros, vivir la vida
Come on, let's be free in Barcelona
Las Ramblas, I'll meet you
Come on and dance with me in Barcelona
Drinking Sangra
I just want to be in Barcelona
Mamacita, rica
Feel that summer breeze in Barcelona
Los otros, viva la vida
Siempre vida Barcelona[Verse 1]
Now I'm in town, break it down, thinking of making a new sound
Playing a different show every night in front of a new crowd
Thats you now, ciao, seems that life is great now
See me lose focus as I sing to you loud
And I cant, no, I wont hush
Ill say the words that make you blush
Im gonna sing this now
See, Im true, my songs are where my heart is
I'm like glue I stick to other artists
I'm not you, now that would be disastrous
Let me sing and do my thing and move to greener pastures
See, Im real, I do it all, its all me
Im not fake, dont ever call me lazy
I wont stay put, give me the chance to be free
Suffolk sadly seems to sort of suffocate me, hey

[Chorus]
Cause you need me, man, I dont need you
You need me, man, I dont need you
You need me, man, I dont need you at all
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I dont need you
You need me, man, I dont need you
You need me, man, I dont need you at all
You need me

[Verse 2]
I sing, "I write my own tune and I write my own verse," hell
Don't need another wordsmith to make my tunes sell
Call yourself a singer-writer, youre just bluffing
Names on the credits and you didnt write nothing
I sing, fast, I know that all my shit's cool
I will blast and I didn't go to Brit school
I came fast with the way I act, right
I cant last, if Im smoking on a crack pipe
And I wont be a product of my genre
My mind will always be stronger than my songs are
Never believe the bullshit that fake guys feed to ya
Always read the stories that you hear on Wikipedia
Musically Im demonstrating
When I perform live, feels like I am meditating
Times at the enterprise when some fella filmed me
A young singer writer like a Gabriella Cilmi yeah

[Chorus]
Cause you need me, man, I dont need you
You need me, man, I dont need you
You need me, man, I dont need you at all
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I dont need you
You need me, man, I dont need you
You need me, man, I dont need you at all
You need me man

[Verse 3]
All I want in this cold world is to make music and use it
Not to abuse it and get affected, infected with the who's who of music
Who did it, who is it, who's in it or what the hell does it matter?
Chitter chatter, don't matter what a yidder, yidder, yadder, it don't matter to me
All I want is a bit of dignity in me to battle this industry freely
To be me in this seedy, needy world, can you hear me?
Hey, so I keep singing that
When I first started this rapping shit I felt pressure from haters
Became invaded with sadists and just developed a hater radar
And made for the stars, kept my grind in the dark
And then appeared with a remedy kicking rhymes with a melody
Hennesey shots and Glocks, all these fools on the block
Who said you gotta be a gangster now to raise to the top?
I'm just a normal, casual, usual, everyday type of guy
With my head in the sky, Ed Sheeran, Urban Angel coming ready to die
So see the signs, stand to the side
Open your eyes and take a look and realize
The resurrection's arrived and as the mist clears
I arise from my tomb in disguise, all alone, Alonestar
Urban Angel rising from the ashes
Surprising all haters, guiding, now moving steady

[Pre-Chorus]
You can find me in the club, bottle full of bub
Mummy I've got the X if you're into taking drugs
Into having sex, I ain't into making love
Come give me a hug if you're into getting rough
You can find me in the club, bottle full of bubbly
Mummy I've got the X if you're into taking drugs
Into having sex, I ain't into making love
Come give me a hug if you're into getting rough

[Chorus]
You need me, man, I dont need you
You need me, man, I dont need you
You need me, man, I dont need you at all
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I dont need you
You need me, man, I dont need you
You need me, man, I dont need you at all
You need me

[Instrumental break]

[Bridge]
My eyes are red, I've been burning, I've been burning
My eyes are red, I've been burning, I've been burning
My eyes are red I've been burning, I've been burning on a spliff off your high grade
My eyes are red I've been burning, I've been burning, burning, burning

[Verse 4]
Now where I come from burning weed it is a habit
A big fat bag of high grade weed, you know I got to have it
Cause if I don't have it in my pocket I'm going to panic
Cause like I said where I come from weed smoking is a habit
Yup, we'll do da bun in the place up in the hood
One of them things I have inherited like a ghetto man should
One of them things is smoking weed it yes it makes me feel good
Burning high grade sensimilla, yes it makes me feel
But me is a man, ah, talk about sensimilla is a drug
And if I start to smoke it I'mma-nna turn into a thug
Where I come from that they talking could that only get you mugged
Where I come from burning weed it is a blessing from above
Where I come from yes we bun it when we listen rub a dub
Where I come from yes we bun after we just-a make a love
Where I come from yes we bun it when the sun starts shine
I blaze high grade weed all the time!

[Bridge]
Now my eyes are red
Cause you need me, I don't need you
You need me man, my eyes are red
You need me man, I don't need you
You need me man, my eyes are red
And you need me, I don't need you
You need me man, my eyes are red
You need me man, I don't need you
You need me man, I don't need you

[Instrumental break]

[Interlude]
Woooah
Woooah
Woooah
Yea

[Verse 5]
Cause with the lyrics I'll be aiming it right
I won't stop until my name's in lights
With stadium heights, with Damian Rice
On red carpets, now I'm on Arabian Nights
Because I'm young I know my brothers gonna give me advice
Long nighter, short height and I gone hyper
Never be anything but a singer/songwriter, yeah
The game's over but now I'm on a new level
Watch how I step on the track without a loop pedal
People think that I'm bound to blow up
I've done around about a thousand shows but
I haven't got a house plus I live on a couch
So you believe the lyrics when I'm singing them out
Wow, from day one I've been prepared
With V05 wax for my ginger hair
Now I'm back to the sofa giving a dose of
What the future holds cause it's another day

[Verse 6]
Rucksack with the old clothes, I rap with cold flows
I'm back with the old jokes, in fact you don't know
On tracks I throw blows to make my punchlines relevant
If you can't keep up you'll get none, you're celibate
My flows developing, skin lacks the melanin
Give me a shot of adrenaline and I get it in
Do it for the hell of it
Cause ever since I hit the mainstream with The A Team I seem to sell a bit
I took what held me back with the women, then I packaged the image
Put in some content, then I sold it back as a gimmick
The fact is this, I'll end up dating actresses
Wake up on dirty mattresses, I think I'll need to practice this
But I make shit happen, call me a laxative
World's on my shoulders, I don't even know what Atlas is
Hard bars sharp like a cactus is
I'm back to rapping, back to back cause I've been practicing
I'm back to sing this

[Chorus]
Cause you need me, man, I dont need you
You need me, man, I dont need you
You need me, man, I dont need you at all
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I dont need you
You need me, man, I dont need you
You need me, man, I dont need you at all
You need me, man

[Verse 7]
I'll keep my last name forever, keep this genre pretty basic
And I'll be breaking into other people's tunes when I chase it
And replace it with the elephant in the room with a facelift
Into another rapper shoes using new laces
I'm selling CD's from my rucksack aiming for the papers
Selling CD's from my rucksack aiming for the majors
Nationwide tour with Just Jack, still had to get the bus back
Clean cut kid without a razor for the mustache
I hit back, when the pen hurts me
I'm still a choir boy in a Fenchurch tee
I'm still the same as a year ago but more people hear me though
According to the MySpace and YouTube videos
I'm always doing shows if I'm not I'm in the studio
Truly broke, never growing up, call me Rufio
Melody music maker, reading all the papers
They say I'm up and coming like I'm fucking in an elevator

[Chorus]
Cause you need me, man, I dont need you
You need me, man, I dont need you
You need me, man, I dont need you at all
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I dont need you
You need me, man, I dont need you
You need me, man, I dont need you at all
You need me man
Don't need yu

[Outro]
Cool[Verse 1]
Ain't got a soapbox I can stand upon
But God gave me a stage, a guitar and a song
My daddy told me, "Son, don't you get involved in
Politics, religions, other peoples' quarrels"

[Pre-Chorus]
I'll paint the picture, let me set the scene
I know when I have children they will know what it means
And I pass on these things my family's given to me
Just love, and understanding positivity

[Chorus]
We could change this whole world with a piano
Add a bass, some guitar, grab a beat and away we go
I'm just a boy with a one-man show
No university, no degree, but lord knows
Everybody's talking 'bout exponential growth
And the stock market crashing and their portfolios
While I'll be sitting here with a song that I wrote
Sing, love could change the world in a moment
But what do I know?
Love can change the world in a moment
But what do I know?
Love can change the world in a moment

[Verse 2]
The revolution's coming, it's a minute away
I saw people marching in the streets today
You know we are made up of love and hate
But both of them are balanced on a razor blade

[Pre-Chorus]
I'll paint the picture, let me set the scene
I know, I'm all for people following their dreams
Just re-remember life is more than fittin' in your jeans
It's love and understanding positivity

[Chorus]
We could change this whole world with a piano
Add a bass, some guitar, grab a beat and away we go
I'm just a boy with a one-man show
No university, no degree, but lord knows
Everybody's talking 'bout exponential growth
And the stock market crashing and their portfolios
While I'll be sitting here with a song I wrote
Sing, love could change the world in a moment
But what do I know?
Love can change the world in a moment
But what do I know?
Love can change the world in a moment

[Pre-Chorus]
I'll paint the picture, let me set the scene
You know, the future's in the hands of you and me
So let's all get together, we can all be free
Spread love and understanding, positivity

[Chorus]
We could change this whole world with a piano
Add a bass, some guitar, grab a beat and away we go
I'm just a boy with a one-man show
No university, no degree, but lord knows
Everybody's talking 'bout exponential growth
And the stock market crashing and their portfolios
While I'll be sitting here with a song I wrote
Sing, love could change the world in a moment
But what do I know?
Love can change the world in a moment
But what do I know?
Love can change the world in a moment[Verse 1]
Give me love like her
'Cause lately I've been waking up alone
Paint splattered teardrops on my shirt
Told you I'd let them go

[Refrain 1]
And that I'll fight my corner
Maybe tonight I'll call ya
After my blood turns into alcohol
No, I just wanna hold ya

[Pre-Chorus]
Give a little time to me, or burn this out
Well play hide and seek to turn this around
All I want is the taste that your lips allow

[Chorus]
Ma-my, my-my-y, oh give me love
Ma-my, my-my-y, oh give me love
Ma-my, my-my-y, oh give me love
Ma-my, my-my-y, oh give me love
Ma-my, my-my-y, give me love

[Verse 2]
Give me love like never before
'Cause lately I've been craving more
And it's been a while, but I still feel the same
Maybe I should let you go

[Refrain 2]
You know I'll fight my corner
And that tonight I'll call ya
After my blood is drowning in alcohol
No, I just wanna hold ya

[Pre-Chorus]
Give a little time to me, or burn this out
Well play hide and seek to turn this around
All I want is the taste that your lips allow
Ma-my, my-my-y, oh give me love
Give a little time to me, or burn this out
Well play hide and seek to turn this around
All I want is the taste that your lips allow

[Chorus]
Ma-my, my-my-y, oh give me love
Ma-my, my-my-y, oh give me love
Ma-my, my-my-y, oh give me love
Ma-my, my-my-y, oh give me love
Ma-my, my-my-y, give me love

But you know I fuckin' love her now
Like nobody ever could

[Refrain: Ed Sheeran]
And you know I stay trippin', am I crazy? Oh, no

[Verse 2: Chance the Rapper]
That she ain't messin' with no other man
Now, what you not gon' do
Is stand there, 'cross from me, like you got kung-fu
Death stare, cross arm, runnin' your mouth like a faucet
But you don't know that my girl been doin' CrossFit
Pew, kung pow, hit your ass with a cross kick
Pulling hair out, wear you out, you exhausted
Know she gonna slide anytime you bitches talk shit
Keep a lil' blade in her fuckin' lip gloss kit, ayy
No one say hi to me without her
Better pay your respect to the queen
Better do that shit without a flirt
Gotta respect the HBIC
Couple of things that you need to know
If you still wanna be friends with me

Just know if you cross her, then you cross me
Cross me, cross me, if you, if you, if you, if you

One, two, three, four

[Verse 1]
Settle down with me
Cover me up, cuddle me in
Lie down with me
And hold me in your arms

[Pre-Chorus]
And your heart's against my chest
Your lips pressed to my neck
I'm falling for your eyes
But they don't know me yet
And with a feeling I'll forget, I'm in love now

[Chorus]
Kiss me like you wanna be loved
You wanna be loved
You wanna be loved
This feels like falling in love
We're falling in love
We're falling in love

[Verse 2]
Settle down with me
And I'll be your safety
You'll be my lady
I was made to keep your body warm
But I'm cold as the wind blows
So hold me in your arms
Oh no

[Pre-Chorus]
My hearts against your chest
Your lips pressed to my neck
I'm falling for your eyes
But they don't know me yet
And with a feeling I'll forget, I'm in love now

[Chorus]
Kiss me like you wanna be loved
You wanna be loved
You wanna be loved
This feels like falling in love
We're falling in love
We're falling in love

[Guitar Solo]

[Bridge]
Yeah, I've been feeling everything
From hate to love
From love to lust
From lust to truth
I guess that's how I know you
So I hold you close to help you give it up

[Chorus]
So kiss me like you wanna be loved
You wanna be loved
You wanna be loved
This feels like falling in love
We're falling in love
We're falling in love
Kiss me like you wanna be loved
You wanna be loved
You wanna be loved
This feels like falling in love
We're falling in love
Falling in love[Verse 1: Ed Sheeran]
The club isn't the best place to find a lover
So the bar is where I go
Me and my friends at the table doing shots
Drinking fast and then we talk slow
And you come over and start up a conversation with just me
And trust me I'll give it a chance now
Take my hand, stop, put Van the Man on the jukebox
And then we start to dance, and now I'm singing like

[Pre-Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
Girl, you know I want your love
Your love was handmade for somebody like me
Come on now, follow my lead
I may be crazy, don't mind me
Say, boy, let's not talk too much
Grab on my waist and put that body on me
Come on now, follow my lead
Come, come on now, follow my lead

[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
I'm in love with the shape of you
We push and pull like a magnet do
Although my heart is falling too
I'm in love with your body
And last night you were in my room
And now my bedsheets smell like you
Every day discovering something brand new
I'm in love with your body
OhIohIohIohI
I'm in love with your body
OhIohIohIohI
I'm in love with your body
OhIohIohIohI
I'm in love with your body
Every day discovering something brand new
I'm in love with the shape of you

[Verse 2: Stormzy]
Check it, I've gotta tell you, I'm in love with your shape
You said them other bruddas couldn't really juggle your weight
And you were shy in the beginning, used to cover your face
You got that sweet, sweet loving, I'm a sucker for cake
I know, girl, you got a body they would kill for
Love you through whatever, who you tryna skip a meal for?
Girl, you're too precious, why you tryna split the bill for?
I ain't even gassing, they should have you up on billboards, that's real talk
And you can go to work and let me pick up the slack
And when you've finished what you're doing, we'll be kicking it back
We can listen to my tunes until you're sick of my raps
And I've got money in the bank, but not a figure like that
You got me looking at your shape, man, I've already won
Tryna come and kill the game like my brother Teddy done
I ain't even tryna play it cool 'cuh this is bigger than my pride
Let me multiply your lovin', then I hit you with Divide
Ayy, check

[Chorus: Ed Sheeran & Stormzy]
I'm in love with the shape of you
We push and pull like a magnet do
Although my heart is falling too
I'm in love with your body
And last night you were in my room
And now my bedsheets smell like you
Every day discovering something brand new
I'm in love with your body
OhIohIohIohI
I'm in love with your body
OhIohIohIohI
I'm in love with your body
OhIohIohIohI
I'm in love with your body
Every day discovering something brand new
I'm in love with the shape of you

[Bridge: Ed Sheeran & Stormzy]
Come on, be my baby, come on
Pour out my liquor, there's not a flaw in your figure, I'm so impressed
Come on, be my baby, come on
And baby, you can call me, it's quicker, I don't be talking on Twitter, girl, that's dead
Come on, be my baby, come on
Girl, stop curbing the question, I'll turn your curse to a blessing, that's overnight
Come on, be my baby, come on
Weigh up your options and spend a day with The Problem, I'll do you right

[Chorus: Ed Sheeran & Stormzy]
I'm in love with the shape of you
We push and pull like a magnet do
Although my heart is falling too
I'm in love with your body
Last night you were in my room
And now my bedsheets smell like you
Every day discovering something brand new
I'm in love with your body
Come on, be my baby, come on
Come on, be my baby, come on
I'm in love with your body
Come on, be my baby, come on
Come on, be my baby, come on
I'm in love with your body
Come on, be my baby, come on
Come on, be my baby, come on
I'm in love with your body
Every day discovering something brand new
I'm in love with the shape of you[Verse 1]
I gave all my oxygen to people that could breathe
I gave away my money and now we don't even speak
I drove miles and miles, but would you do the same for me?
Oh, honestly?
Offered off my shoulder just for you to cry upon
Gave you constant shelter and a bed to keep you warm
They gave me the heartache and in return I gave a song
It goes on and on

[Chorus]
Life can get you down so I just numb the way it feels
I drown it with a drink and out-of-date prescription pills
And all the ones that love me they just left me on the shelf
No farewell
So before I save someone else, I've got to save myself

[Verse 2]
I gave you all my energy and I took away your pain
'Cause human beings are destined to radiate or drain
What line do we stand upon, 'cause from here it looks the same
And only scars remain

[Chorus]
Life can get you down so I just numb the way it feels
I drown it with a drink and out-of-date prescription pills
And all the ones that love me they just left me on the shelf
No farewell
So before I save someone else, I've got to save myself

[Verse 3]
But if I don't
Then I'll go back
To where I'm rescuing a stranger
Just because they needed saving just like that
Oh, I'm here again
Between the devil and the danger
But I guess it's just my nature
My dad was wrong
'Cause I'm not like my mum
'Cause she'd just smile and I'm complaining in a song
But it helps
So before I save someone else
I've got to save myself

[Chorus]
Life can get you down so I just numb the way it feels
I drown it with a drink and out-of-date prescription pills
And all the ones that love me they just left me on the shelf
No farewell
So before I save someone else, I've got to save myself
And before I blame someone else, I've got to save myself
And before I love someone else, I've got to love myself[Intro]
Bibia be ye ye

[Verse 1]
I lost my shoes last night, I don't know where I put my keys
I was tired and fell asleep beneath an oak tree
I bet my mother's proud of me from each scar
Upon my knuckle and each graze upon my knee, and all I know
Is I got a cab and then threw up on his car seat
He kicked me out and then I walked in the rain
I tell myself in every way I won't be doing this again
And tomorrow's a brand new day

[Chorus]
Someone told me, "Always say what's on your mind"
And I am only being honest with you, I
I get lonely and make mistakes from time to time
Se enioma enko ye, bibia be ye ye
Bibia be ye ye, ye ye, ye ye
Bibia be ye ye

[Verse 2]
I remember less and less and mostly things that I regret
In my phone are several texts, from girls I've never met
And in the pocket of my jeans are only coins and broken dreams
My heart is breaking at the seams and I'm coming apart now
Now things are looking up, I'll find my shoes right next to the oak tree
And I'll get a bus straight into town and spend the afternoon
Looking around for the things that I left on the ground
And say you're with me, tomorrow's a brand new day

[Chorus]
Someone told me, "Always say what's on your mind"
And I am only being honest with you, I
I get lonely and make mistakes from time to time
Se enioma enko ye, bibia be ye ye
Wo nooma (be ye ye)
Wo nooma maaaa ye (be ye ye)
Wo nooma (be ye ye)
Wo nooma maaaa ye (be ye ye)
Wo nooma (be ye ye)
Wo nooma maaaa ye (be ye ye)
Wo nooma (be ye ye)
Wo nooma maaaa ye (be ye ye)

[Chorus]
Someone told me, "Always say what's on your mind"
And I am only being honest with you, I
I get lonely and make mistakes from time to time
Se enioma enko ye, bibia be ye ye
Bibia be ye ye, ye ye, ye ye
Bibia be ye ye
Wo nooma (be ye ye)
Wo nooma maaaa ye (be ye ye) (bibia be ye ye, ye ye ye ye)
Wo nooma (be ye ye)
Wo nooma maaaa ye (be ye ye)
Bibia be ye ye
Wo nooma (be ye ye)
Wo nooma maaaa ye (be ye ye)
Wo nooma (be ye ye)
Wo nooma maaaa ye (be ye ye)[Verse 1]
I'm gonna pick up the pieces
And build a LEGO house
If things go wrong we can knock it down
My three words have two meanings
There's one thing on my mind
It's all for you

[Pre-Chorus]
And it's dark in a cold December
But I've got you to keep me warm
And if you're broken I'll mend you
And keep you sheltered from the storm that's raging on now

[Chorus]
I'm out of touch, I'm out of love
I'll pick you up when you're getting down
And out of all these things I've done
I think I love you better now
I'm out of sight, I'm out of mind
I'll do it all for you in time
And out of all these things I've done
I think I love you better now
Now

[Verse 2]
I'm gonna paint you by numbers
And colour you in
If things go right, we can frame it
And put you on a wall
And it's so hard to say it
But I've been here before
Now I'll surrender up my heart
And swap it for yours

[Chorus]
I'm out of touch, I'm out of love
I'll pick you up when you're getting down
And out of all these things I've done
I think I love you better now
I'm out of sight, I'm out of mind
I'll do it all for you in time
And out of all these things I've done
I think I love you better now

[Bridge]
Don't hold me down
I think the braces are breaking
And it's more than I can take

[Pre-Chorus]
And it's dark in a cold December
But I've got you to keep me warm
If you're broken I'll mend you
And keep you sheltered from the storm that's raging on now

[Chorus]
I'm out of touch, I'm out of love
I'll pick you up when you're getting down
And out of all these things I've done
I think I love you better now
I'm out of sight, I'm out of mind
I'll do it all for you in time
And out of all these things I've done
I think I love you better now

[Outro]
I'm out of touch, I'm out of love
I'll pick you up when you're getting down
And out of all these things I've done
I will love you better now[Verse 1]
She is the sweetest thing that I know
Should see the way she holds me when the lights go low
Shakes my soul like a pothole every time
Took my heart upon a one way trip
Guess she went wandering off with it
And unlike most women I know
This one will bring it back whole
Daisies, daisies perched upon your forehead
Oh my baby, lately I know

[Chorus]
That every night I'll kiss you, you'll say in my ear
"Oh, we're in love, aren't we?"
Hands in your hair
Fingers and thumbs, baby
I feel safe when you're holding me near
Love the way that you conquer your fear
You know hearts don't break around here
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah

[Verse 2]
She is the river flow in Orwell
And tin wind chimes used for doorbells
Fields and trees and her smell fill my lungs
Spend my summertime beside her
And the rest of the year, the same
She is the flint that sparks the lighter
And the fuel that will hold the flame, oh
Roses, roses laid upon your bed spread, oh my
All this, all this I know

[Chorus]
But every night I'll kiss you, you'll say in my ear
"Oh, we're in love, aren't we?"
Hands in your hair
Fingers and thumbs, baby
I feel safe when you're holding me near
Love the way that you conquer your fear
You know hearts don't break around here
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Bridge]
Well, I found love hidden inside
The arms of the woman I know
She is the lighthouse in the night
That will safely guide me home
And I'm not scared of passing over
Or the thought of growing old
'Cause from now until I go

[Chorus]
Every night I kiss you, you'll say in my ear
"Oh, we're in love, aren't we?"
Hands in your hair
Fingers and thumbs, baby
I feel safe when you're holding me near
Love the way that you conquer your fear
You know hearts don't break around here
Oh yeah, yeah
Every night I kiss you, you'll say in my ear
"Oh, we're in love, aren't we?"
Hands in your hair
Fingers and thumbs, baby
I feel safe when you're holding me near
Love the way that you conquer your fear
You know hearts don't break around here
Yeah, yeah, yeah
You know hearts don't break around here
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah[Verse 1]
You look so wonderful in your dress
I love your hair like that
The way it falls on the side of your neck
Down your shoulders and back
We are surrounded by all of these lies
And people that talk too much
You got the kind of look in your eyes
As if no one knows anything but us

[Pre-Chorus]
Should this be the last thing I see
I want you to know its enough for me
Cause all that you are is all that Ill ever need

[Chorus]
I'm so in love
So in love
So in love
So in love

[Verse 2]
You look so beautiful in this light
You silhouette over me
The way it brings out the blue in your eyes
Is the Tenerife sea
And all of the voices surrounding us here
They just fade out when you take a breath
Just say the word and I will disappear
Into the wilderness

[Pre-Chorus]
Should this be the last thing I see
I want you to know its enough for me
Cause all that you are is all that Ill ever need

[Chorus]
I'm so in love
So in love
So in love
So in love

[Bridge]
Lumiere darling
Lumiere over me
Lumiere darling
Lumiere over me
Lumiere darling
Lumiere over me

[Pre-Chorus]
Should this be the last thing I see
I want you to know its enough for me
Cause all that you are is all that Ill ever need

[Chorus]
I'm so in love
So in love
So in love
So in love

[Outro]
You look so wonderful in your dress
I love your hair like that
And in a moment I knew you, Beth[Verse 1]
Oh, I'm a mess right now, inside out
Searching for a sweet surrender, but this is not the end
I can't work it out, how
Going through the motions, going through us

[Pre-Chorus]
And oh, I've known it for the longest time
And all of my hopes, all of my words
Are all over written on the signs
When you're on my road walking me home
Home, home, home, home

[Chorus]
See the flames inside my eyes
It burns so bright I wanna feel your love, no
Easy baby, maybe I'm a liar
But for tonight I wanna fall in love
Put your faith in my stomach

[Verse 2]
I messed up this time, late last night
Drinking to suppress devotion, with fingers intertwined
I can't shake this feeling now
We're going through the motions, hoping you'd stop

[Pre-Chorus]
And oh, I've only caused you pain, you know
That all of my words will always be low
Of all the love we spoke
When you're on my road walking me home
Home, home, home, home

[Chorus]
See the flames inside my eyes
It burns so bright I wanna feel your love, no
Easy baby, maybe I'm a liar
But for tonight I wanna fall in love
Put your faith in my stomach

[Bridge]
And for how long I love my lover?
For how long I love my lover, now, now?
For how long-long I love my lover, now, now?
For how long-long I love my lover, now, now?
For how long-long I love my lover, now, now? (And I feel love)
For how long-long I love my lover?
(Feel it all over now now and I feel love)
For how long-long I love my lover, now, now
(Feel it all over now now and I feel love)
For how long-long I love my lover, now, now
(Feel it all over now now and I feel love)
For how long-long I love my lover, now, now
(Feel it all over now now and I feel love)
For how long-long I love my lover, now, now
(Feel it all over now now and I feel love)

[Outro]
For how long I love my lover, now, now?
For how long-long I love my lover?[Intro]
I don't want bruise your ears
Or hurt you again
But I got back-stabbed by a black cab
When I needed a friend

[Verse 1]
Now I'm in town, break it down, thinking of making a new sound
Playing a different show every night in front of a new crowd
Thats you now, ciao, seems that life is great now
See me lose focus as I sing to you loud
I can't, no, I won't hush
I'll say the words that make you blush
I'm gonna sing this now (Oh, oh)
See, Im true, my songs are where my heart is
I'm like glue, I stick to other artists
I'm not you, now that would be disastrous
Let me sing and do my thing and move to greener pastures
See, I'm real, I do it all, it's all me
I'm not fake, don't ever call me lazy
I won't stay put, give me the chance to be free
Suffolk sadly seems to sort of suffocate me

[Chorus]
'Cause you need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you at all
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you at all
You need me

[Verse 2]
I sing and write my own tune and I write my own verse hell
Don't need another wordsmith to make my tunes sell
Call yourself a singer-writer, you're just bluffing
Name's on the credits and you didn't write nothing
I sing, fast, I know that all my shit's cool
I will blast and I didn't go to BRIT School
I came fast with the way I act, right
I can't last if I'm smoking on a crack pipe
And I won't be a product of my genre
My mind will always be stronger than my songs are
Never believe the bullshit that fake guys feed to ya
Always read the stories that you hear in Wikipedia
And musically I'm demonstrating
When I perform live, feels like I am meditating
Times at the enterprise when some fella filmed me
A young singer-writer like a Gabriella Cilmi

[Chorus]
'Cause you need me, man, I dont need you
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you at all
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you at all
You need me

[Verse 3]
'Cause with the lyrics I'll be aiming it right
I won't stop until my name's in lights
With stadium heights, with Damien Rice
On red carpets, now I'm on Arabian Nights
Because I'm young I know my brothers gonna give me advice
Long nighter, short height and I gone hyper
Never be anything but a singer-songwriter, yeah
The game's over but now I'm on a new level
Watch how I step on the track without a loop pedal
People think that I'm bound to blow up
I've done around about a thousand shows, but
I haven't got a house, plus I live on a couch
So you believe the lyrics when I'm singing them out
Wow, from day one I've been prepared
With V05 wax for my ginger hair
So now I'm back to the sofa giving a dose of
What the future holds 'cause it's another day
Plus I'll keep my last name forever, keep this genre pretty basic
Gonna be breaking into other people's tunes when I chase it
And replace it with the elephant in the room with a facelift
Slipping into another rapper shoes using new laces
I'm selling CDs from my rucksack aiming for the papers
Selling CDs from my rucksack aiming for the majors
Nationwide tour with Just Jack, still had to get the bus back
Clean cut kid without a razor for the moustache
I hit back when the pen hurts me
I'm still a choir boy in a Fenchurch tee
I'm still the same as a year ago
But more people hear me though
According to the MySpace and YouTube videos
I'm always doing shows if I'm not I'm in the studio
Truly broke, never growing up, call me Rufio
Melody music maker, reading all the papers
They say I'm up and coming like I'm fucking in an elevator

[Chorus]
'Cause you need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you at all
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you at all
You need me, man, I don't need you[Verse 1]
It's late in the evening
Glass on the side
I've been sat with you
For most of the night
Ignorin' everybody here
We wish they would disappear
So maybe we could get down now
And I don't wanna know
If you're gettin' ahead of the program
I want you to be mine, lady
To hold your body close
Take another step into the no-man's land
And for the longest time, lady

[Pre-Chorus]
I need you darling
Come on, set the tone
If you feel you're fallin'
Wont you let me know
If you love me
Come on, get involved
Feel it rushin' through you
From your head to toe

[Chorus]
SING!
LOUDER!
SING!

[Verse 2]
This love is ablaze, I saw flames from the side of the stage
And the fire brigade comes in a couple of days
Until then, we got nothin' to say and nothin' to know
But somethin' to drink and maybe somethin' to smoke
Let it go until our roads are changed
Singin' "We Found Love" in a local rave
No, I don't really know what I'm supposed to say
But I can just figure it out, then hope and pray
I told her my name, then said "It's nice to meet you"
Then she handed me a bottle of water filled with tequila
I already know if she's a keeper
Just from this one small act of kindness, I'm in
Deep shit if anybody finds out
I meant to drive home but I drunk all of it now
Not soberin' up, we just sit on the couch
One thing led to another, now she's kissin' my mouth

[Pre-Chorus]
I need you darling
Come on, set the tone
If you feel you're fallin'
Wont you let me know
If you love me
Come on, get involved
Feel it rushin' through you
From your head to toe

[Chorus]
SING!
LOUDER!
SING!

[Bridge]
Can you feel it?
All the guys in here don't even wanna dance
Can you feel it?
All that I can hear is music from the back
But can you feel it?
Found you hidin' here so won't you take my hand, darlin'?
Before the beat kicks in again
Can you feel it?
Can you feel it?

[Final Chorus]
SING!
I need you darling
Come on, set the tone
If you feel you're fallin'
Wont you let me know
LOUDER!
SING!
If you love me
Come on, get involved
Feel it rushin' through you
From your head to toe
LOUDER!
SING![Verse 1]
Tell me that you'll turn down the man
Who asks for your hand
Cause you're waiting for me
And I know, you're gonna be away a while
But I've got no plans at all to leave
And would you take away my hopes and dreams?
And just stay with me

[Chorus]
All my senses come to life
While I'm stumbling home as drunk as I
Have ever been and I'll never leave again
Cause you are the only one
And all my friends have gone to find
Another place to let their hearts collide
Just promise me, you'll always be a friend
Cause you are the only one

[Verse 2]
Take my hand and my
Heart and soul, I will
Only have these eyes for you
And you know, everything changes but
We'll be strangers if we see this through
You could stay within these walls and bleed
Or just stay with me, oh Lord now

[Chorus]
All my senses come to life
While I'm stumbling home as drunk as I
Have ever been and I'll never leave again
Cause you are the only one
And all my friends have gone to find
Another place to let their hearts collide
Just promise me, you'll always be a friend
Cause you are the only one

[Bridge]
Stumbling half drunk, getting myself lost
I am so gone, so tell me the way home
I listen to sad songs, singing about love
And where it goes wrong

[Chorus]
All my senses come to life
While I'm stumbling home as drunk as I
Have ever been and I'll never leave again
Cause you are the only one
And all my friends have gone to find
Another place to let their hearts collide
Just promise me, you'll always be a friend
Cause you are the only one[Verse 1]
Things were all good yesterday
And then the devil took your memory
And if you fell to your death today
I hope that heaven is your resting place
I heard the doctors put your chest in pain
But then that could've been the medicine
And now you're lying in the bed again
Either way I'll cry with the rest of them

[Pre-Chorus]
And my father told me "son
It's not his fault he doesn't know your face
And you're not the only one"
Although my grandma used to say that he used to sing

[Chorus]
Darling, hold me in your arms the way you did last night
And we'll lie inside for a little while here, oh
I could look into your eyes until the sun comes up
And we're wrapped in light and life and love
Put your open lips on mine and slowly let them shut
For they're designed to be together, oh
With your body next to mine, our hearts will beat as one
And we're set alight, we're afire love
Oh love

[Verse 2]
And things were all good yesterday
But then the devil took your breath away
And now we're left here in the pain
Black suit, black tie, standing in the rain
And now my family is one again
Stapled together with the strangers and a friend
Came to my mind, I should paint it with a pen
Six years old, I remember when

[Pre-Chorus]
And my father told me "son
It's not his fault he doesn't know your face
And you're not the only one"
Although my grandma used to say that he used to sing

[Chorus]
Darling, hold me in your arms the way you did last night
And we'll lie inside for a little while here, oh
I could look into your eyes until the sun comes up
And we're wrapped in light and life and love
Put your open lips on mine and slowly let them shut
For they're designed to be together, oh
With your body next to mine, our hearts will beat as one
And we're set alight, we're afire love
Oh love

[Bridge]
And my father and all of my family
Rise from their seats to sing hallelujah
And my brother and all of my family
Rise from their seats to sing hallelujah
And my brother and all of my family
Rise from their seats to sing hallelujah
And all my brother and my sisters
And my father and all of my family
Rise from their seats to sing hallelujah[Verse 1]
I've been spinning now for time
Couple women by my side
I got sinning on my mind
Sipping on red wine
I've been sitting here for ages
Ripping out the pages
How'd I get so faded?
How'd I get so faded?

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, no, no, don't leave me lonely now
If you loved me how'd you never learn
Ooh, coloured crimson in my eyes
One or two could free my mind

[Chorus]
This is how it ends
I feel the chemicals
Burn in my bloodstream
Fading out again
I feel the chemicals
Burn in my bloodstream
So tell me when it kicks in
Tell me when it kicks in

[Verse 2]
I've been looking for a lover
Thought I'd find her in a bottle
God, make me another one
I'll be feeling this tomorrow
Lord forgive me for the things I've done
I was never meant to hurt no one
I saw scars upon a broken hearted lover

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, no, no, don't leave me lonely now
If you loved me how'd you never learn
Ooh, coloured crimson in my eyes
One or two could free my mind

[Chorus]
This is how it ends
I feel the chemicals
Burn in my bloodstream
Fading out again
I feel the chemicals
Burn in my bloodstream
So tell me when it kicks in
Well, tell me when it kicks in
Tell me when it kicks in

[Outro/Collision]
All the voices in my mind
Calling out across the line
All the voices in my mind
Calling out across the line
All the voices in my mind
Calling out across the line
All the voices in my mind
Calling out across the line
All the voices in my mind
Calling out across the line
All the voices in my mind
Calling out across the line
All the voices in my mind (tell me when it kicks in)
Calling out across the line (and I saw scars upon her)
All the voices in my mind (tell me when it kicks in)
Calling out across the line (brokenhearted)
All the voices in my mind (tell me when it kicks in)
Calling out across the line (and I saw scars upon her)
All the voices in my mind (tell me when it kicks in)
Calling out across the line (brokenhearted)
All the voices in my mind (tell me when it kicks in)
Calling out across the line (and I saw scars upon her)
All the voices in my mind (tell me when it kicks in)
Calling out across the line (brokenhearted)
All the voices in my mind (tell me when it kicks in)
Calling out across the line (and I saw scars upon her)
All the voices in my mind (tell me when it kicks in)
Calling out across the line (brokenhearted)
So tell me when it kicks in
And I saw scars upon her
Tell me when it kicks in
Brokenhearted
Tell me when it kicks in
And I saw scars upon her
Tell me when it kicks in
Brokenhearted[Chorus: Ed Sheeran & Stormzy]
Jet plane headed up to the sky
Spread wings in the clouds, getting high
We ain't hit a rave in a while
So take me back to London (Yo)

[Verse 1: Stormzy]
I do deals, but I never get twanged (Twanged)
Moves that ain't ever been planned (Planned)
No goons that were never in gangs (Gangs)
Where I'm from, chat shit get banged (What?)
Where I'm from, chat shit, let a 12 gauge rip
Yeah, it's sick how it fits in my hand (Hand)
I don't mix with the glitz and the glam (Glam)
All these stupid pricks on the 'Gram
I don't do online beef, or neeky grime beef
I'm way too G'd up to beef with grime neek
I bought an AP to help me time keep
My shooter ride deep, he moves when I speak
My shooter ride (Ride), he shoot a guy (Guy)
Leave you wet like you scuba dived
We were younger then and now we're unified
South London boys, get you crucified, I'm gone

[Verse 2: Ed Sheeran & Stormzy]
It's that time
Big Mike and Teddy are on grime
I wanna try new things, they just want me to sing
Because nobody thinks I write rhymes
And now I'm back in the bits with my guy
Give me a packet of crisps with my pint
I hit my friends up, go straight to the pub
'Cause I haven't been home in time, yes, I
But that's my fault (Oh)
Grossed half a billi' on the Divide Tour (Oh)
Yes, I ain't kidding, what would I lie for? (Oh)
But now I'm back on the track with Big Michael (Woah)
He said, "Teddy, never get off your high horse
And never let 'em take your crown"
I've been away for a while, traveled a million miles
But I'm heading back to London town right now

[Chorus: Ed Sheeran & Stormzy]
Jet plane headed up to the sky (To the sky)
Spread wings in the clouds, getting high (Woop, woop)
We ain't hit a rave in a while (In a while)
So take me back to London
Bass high, middle nights, ceilin' low (Ceilin' low)
Sweat brow drippin' down, when in Rome (When in Rome)
No town does it quite like my home
So take me back to London

[Verse 3: Stormzy & Ed Sheeran]
Yo, when I squeeze off this little pen of mine
Done the remix, now I got Ed on grime
And this ain't like any top ten of mine
I arrived at Wembley ahead of time
And that's stadiums, man are aliens
I drink supermalts and Vibranium
I got an RM11 titanium
And I rock a 5970 daily, but
I want soul, I want flows
Don't need tags ripping off my clothes
Don't need pricks blowin' up my phone
And Ted said, "That's just the way things go"
It's just the way things go, amazin' flows
Grime or rap, man, I gave 'em both
Took this sound that was made in Bow
Went global, man, now the case is closed
2015 in a Badingham pub
I told Stormz two years, he'll be wrapping it up
And you'll go through tears with the people you love
But when you get to the top, man, it's never enough
'Cause you can win BRITs (It don't stop)
And you can do Glasto (Headline slot)
But when you're miles away and you're feeling alone
Gotta remember that there ain't no place like home

[Chorus: Ed Sheeran & Stormzy]
Jet plane headed up to the sky (To the sky)
Spread wings in the clouds, getting high (Getting high)
We ain't hit a rave in a while (In a while)
So take me back to London
Bass high, middle nights, ceilin' low (Ceilin' low)
Sweat brow drippin' down, when in Rome (When in Rome)
No town does it quite like my home (Like my home)
So take me back to London
So take me back to London[Verse 1]
I'm not a rapper, I'm a singer with a flow
I've got a habit for spitting quicker lyrics, you know
You'll find me ripping the writtens out of the pages they sit in
I never want to get bitten 'cause plagiarism is hidden
Watch how I sit on the rhythm, prisoner with the vision
Signed to a label but didn't listen to any criticism
Thought you knew but you didn't, so perk your ears up and listen
Studio is a system and you could say that I'm driven
And now it's onto the next saga, we drink the best lager
I'll never try to win you over like your stepfather
I'll do my own thing now and get respect after
And I'm avoiding the 'caine like it was Get Carter
For four years I never had a place to stay
But it's safe to say that it kept me grounded like a paperweight
At 16 years old, yeah, I moved out of my home
I was Macy Gray, I tried to say goodbye and I choked
And went from sleeping at a subway station
To sleeping with a movie star and adding to the population
Not my imagination, I don't wanna relax
Would it hurt your reputation if I put it on wax? I'll take it back now

[Hook]
Mmm, come on and take it back, love
Come on and take it back for us
Don't you fade into the back, love
No

[Verse 2]
I take it back with the rhythm and blues
With my rap pack, I'll be singing the news
Tryna act like Jack Black when I bring it to school
I'll make a beat with my feet by just hitting a loop
Bringing the lyrics to prove that I can fit in these shoes
I'll give you the truth through the vocal booth
And stars burst out on the scene like an Opal Fruit
They try to take aim like Beckham when he goes to shoot
But then again that's what they're supposed to do
And I'm supposed to be calm, I tattooed the lyrics onto my arm
Whispering, "Everything that happens is from now on"
I'll be ready to start again by the end of the song
And still they're claiming that I handle it wrong
But then I've never had an enemy except the NME
But I'll be selling twice as many copies as their magazines'll ever be
With only spectacles ahead of me and festival fees
Are healthier than a dalmatian on Pedigree
Singing for the masses, rubber dinghy rapids
I keep this rapping a habit and keep on fashioning magic
I'm battling for respect, and I don't know if I'll have it
This song's from the heart, covered the planet, I'll take it back now

[Hook]
Mmm, come on and take it back, love
Come on and take it back for us
Don't you fade into the back, love
No, I'll take it back now

[Verse 3]
Now, I don't ever wanna be perfect
'Cause I'm a singer that you never wanna see shirtless
And I accept the fact that someone's gotta win worst-dressed
Taking my first steps into the scene, giving me focus
Putting on a brave face like Timothy Dalton
Considering a name change, thinking it was hopeless
Rhyming over recordings, avoiding tradition
'Cause every day some lyrics and a melody could be written
Now absence can make your heart ache
But drinking Absinthe can change your mind state
Vividly, need to let my liver be
And I'll say it again, living life on the edge with a closed handful of friends
It's good advice from the man who took his life on the road with me
And I hope to see him blowing up globally
'Cause that's how it's supposed to be, I'm screaming out vocally
It might seem totally impossible achieving life's dreams, but
But I just write schemes
I'm never having a stylist giving me tight jeans
Madison Square Garden is where I might be, but more likely
You'll find me in the back room of a dive bar with my mates
Having a pint with McDaid, discussing records we made
And every single second knowing that we'll never betray
The way we were raised, remembering our background, sat down
That's how we plan it out, it's time to take it back now

[Hook]
Mmm, come on and take it back, love
Come on and take it back for us
Don't you fade into the back, love
No
Mmm, come on and take it back, love
Come on and take it back for us
Don't you fade into the back, love
No

[Verse 4]
My dreams keep me awake at night, written in rhyme
Till I deliver the hype, am I just living a lie?
With this you must know that the numbers just sold
Will keep me going through the tough times, dream with me
We forget 90 percent of it when we wake
But the other 10 percent, it never fades
Dreaming dreams of day-to-day goals, stay awake loads
Tried to make the cut like the paper with a razor blade
Oh, never give up, just remember just to hold out more
A couple years ago I couldn't just control that thought
You'd find me busking on the street when it was cold outdoors
Now I'm sweating on the stage of a sold-out tour
Writing love songs for the sake of it, never to make a hit
You can't fake talent and work ethic just to make it quick
I'm not a rapper, I'm a singer, I just take the piss
And most of these other guys are kids that pose
His little sister has to babysit, that's just the way it is
Dreams are your own, just set your goals and have the upmost faith in it
Tread your own path, you'll never make it as a follower
You'll never know where you will go or you will be tomorrow
Igh![Verse 1]
I found your hairband on my bedroom floor
The only evidence that you've been here before
And I don't get waves of missing you anymore
They're more like tsunami tides in my eyes
Never getting dry, so I get high
Smoke away the days, never sleep with the light on
Weeks pass in the blink of an eye
And I'm still drunk at the end of the night
I don't drink like everybody else
I do it to forget things about myself
Stumble and fall with head spin I've got
My mind's with you but my heart's just not

[Pre-Chorus]
So am I close to you anymore, if it's over
And there's no chance that we'll work it out?

[Chorus]
That's why you and I
Ended over U-N-I
And I said that's fine
But you're the only one that knows I lied
You and I
Ended over U-N-I
And I said that's fine
But you're the only one that knows I lied

[Verse 2]
Everybody said we'd be together forever but I know that
I never wanna settle down, come around
Break up the love like Lego now
Never wanna turn into another "like you"
Sleep with my thoughts dance with my views
Everythings great, not everythings sure
But you live in your halls and I live in a tour bus
Now I'm in position to be another stalker
Like every thing I say seems to always sound awkward
Like our last kiss it was perfect, we were nervous
On the surface
And I'm always saying everyday that it was worth it
Pain is only relevant if it still hurts
I forget like an elephant, or we can use a sedative
And go back to the day we fell in love just on our first kiss

[Pre-Chorus]
So am I close to you anymore, if it's over
And there's no chance that we'll work it out?

[Chorus]
Oh, you and I
Ended over U-N-I
And I said that's fine
But you're the only one that knows I lied
You and I
Ended over U-N-I
And I said that's fine
But you're the only one that knows I lied

[Verse 3]
Because, if I was gonna go somewhere
I'd be there by now
And maybe I can let myself down (wo-oahh)
And thinking I am unaware, I keep my feet on the ground
Keep looking around, to make sure I'm not, the only one to feel low
Because if you want, I'll take you in my arms and keep you sheltered
From all that I've done wrong
And I'll know you'll say, that I'm the only one
But I know God made another one of me
To love you better than I ever will

[Chorus]
'Cause you and I
Ended over U-N-I
And I said that's fine
But you're the only one that knows I lied
You and I
Ended over U-N-I
And I said that's fine
But you're the only one that knows I lied[Verse 1]
It's a little bit funny, this feeling inside
I'm not one of those who can easily hide
I don't have much money, but, boy, if I did
I'd buy a big house where we both could live
If I was a sculptor, heh, but then again, no
Or a man who makes potions in a traveling show
I know it's not much, but it's the best I can do
My gift is my song, and this one's for you

[Chorus]
And you can tell everybody this is your song
It may be quite simple, but now that it's done
I hope you don't mind, I hope you don't mind
That I put down in words
How wonderful life is while you're in the world

[Verse 2]
I sat on the roof and kicked off the moss
Well, a few of the verses, well, they've got me quite cross
But the sun's been quite kind while I wrote this song
It's for people like you that keep it turned on
So excuse me forgetting, but these things I do
You see, I've forgotten if they're green or they're blue
Anyway, the thing is, what I really mean
Yours are the sweetest eyes I've ever seen

[Chorus]
And you can tell everybody this is your song
It may be quite simple, but now that it's done
I hope you don't mind, I hope you don't mind
That I put down in words
How wonderful life is while you're in the world

[Outro]
I hope you don't mind, I hope you don't mind
That I put down in words
How wonderful life is while you're in the world[Verse 1]
She packed my bags last night, pre-flight
Zero hour: 9:00 a.m
And I'm gonna be high as a kite by then
I miss the Earth so much, I miss my wife
It's lonely out in space
On such a timeless flight

[Chorus]
And I think it's gonna be a long, long time
'Til touchdown brings me 'round again to find
I'm not the man they think I am at home
Oh no, no, no
I'm a rocket man
Rocket man, burning out his fuse up here alone
And I think it's gonna be a long, long time
'Til touchdown brings me 'round again to find
I'm not the man they think I am at home
Oh no, no, no
I'm a rocket man
Rocket man, burning out his fuse up here alone

[Verse 2]
Mars ain't the kind of place to raise your kids
In fact, it's cold as hell
And there's no one there to raise them if you did
And all this science I don't understand
It's just my job five days a week
A rocket man
A rocket man

[Chorus]
And I think it's gonna be a long, long time
'Til touchdown brings me 'round again to find
I'm not the man they think I am at home
Oh no, no, no
I'm a rocket man
Rocket man, burning out his fuse up here alone
And I think it's gonna be a long, long time
'Til touchdown brings me 'round again to find
I'm not the man they think I am at home
Oh no, no, no
I'm a rocket man
Rocket man, burning out his fuse up here alone

[Outro]
And I think it's gonna be a long, long time
And I think it's gonna be a long, long time
And I think it's gonna be a long, long time
And I think it's gonna be a long, long time
And I think it's gonna be a long, long time
And I think it's gonna be a long, long time
And I think it's gonna be a long, long time
And I think it's gonna be a long, long time
And I think it's gonna be a long, long time[Verse 1]
Blue jean baby, L.A. lady
Seamstress for the band
Pretty-eyed, pirate smile
You'll marry a music man
Ballerina, you must've seen her
Dancing in the sand
And now she's in me, always with me
Tiny dancer in my hand

[Verse 2]
Jesus freaks out in the street
Handing tickets out for God
Turning back, she just laughs
The boulevard is not that bad
Piano man, he makes his stand
In the auditorium
Looking on, she sings the songs
The words she knows, the tune she hums

[Pre-Chorus]
But, oh, how it feels so real
Lying here with no one near
Only you, and you can hear me
When I say softly, slowly

[Chorus]
Hold me closer, tiny dancer
Count the headlights on the highway
Lay me down in sheets of linen
You had a busy day today
Hold me closer, tiny dancer
Count the headlights on the highway
Lay me down in sheets of linen
You had a busy day today

[Verse 1]
Blue jean baby, L.A. lady
Seamstress for the band
Pretty-eyed, pirate smile
You'll marry a music man

Tiny dancer in my hand

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, how it feels so real
Lying here with no one near
Only you, and you can hear me
When I say softly, slowly

[Chorus]
Hold me closer, tiny dancer
Count the headlights on the highway
Lay me down in sheets of linen
You had a busy day today
Hold me closer, tiny dancer
Count the headlights on the highway
Lay me down in sheets of linen
You had a busy day today[Verse 1]
Hey kids, shake it loose together
The spotlight's hitting something
That's been known to change the weather
We'll kill the fatted calf tonight so stick around
You're gonna hear electric music, solid walls of sound

[Pre-Chorus]
Say, Candy and Ronnie, have you seen them yet?
Ooh, but they're so spaced out
B-B-B-Bennie and the Jets
Oh, but they're weird and they're wonderful
Oh, Bennie, she's really keen

[Chorus]
She's got electric boots, a mohair suit
You know I read it in a magazine, oh
B-B-B-Bennie and the Jets

[Verse 2]
Hey kids, plug into the faithless
Maybe they're blinded, but Bennie makes them ageless
We shall survive, let us take ourselves along
Where we fight our parents out in the streets
To find who's right and who's wrong

[Pre-Chorus]
Say, Candy and Ronnie, have you seen them yet?
Ooh, but they're so spaced out
B-B-B-Bennie and the Jets
Oh, but they're weird and they're wonderful
Oh, Bennie, she's really keen

[Chorus]
She's got electric boots
A mohair suit
You know I read it in a magazine
B-B-B-Bennie and the Jets

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, Candy and Ronnie, have you seen them yet?
Oh, but they're so spaced out
B-B-B-B-B-Bennie and the Jets
Oh, but they're weird and they're wonderful
Oh, Bennie, she's really keen

[Chorus]
She's got electric boots, a mohair suit
You know I read it in a magazine
B-B-B-Bennie and the Jets

[Outro]

When are you gonna come down?
When are you going to land?
I should have stayed on the farm
I should have listened to my old man
You know you can't hold me forever
I didn't sign up with you
I'm not a present for your friends to open
This boy's too young to be singing
The blues

[Bridge]
Ah, ah ha ah ah
Ah ah ha ha

[Chorus]
So goodbye yellow brick road
Where the dogs of society howl
You can't plant me in your penthouse
I'm going back to my plough
Back to the howling, old owl in the woods
Hunting the horny-back toad
Oh, I've finally decided my future lies
Beyond the yellow brick road

[Bridge]
Ah, ah ha ah ah
Ah ah ha

[Verse 2]
What do you think you'll do, then?
I bet they'll shoot down the plane
It'll take you a couple of vodka and tonics
To set you on your feet again
Maybe you'll get a replacement
There's plenty like me to be found
Mongrels who ain't got a penny
Sniffing for tidbits like you on the ground

[Bridge]
Ah, ah ha ah ah
Ah ah ha

[Chorus]
So goodbye yellow brick road
Where the dogs of society howl
You can't plant me in your penthouse
I'm going back to my plough
Back to the howling, old owl in the woods
Hunting the horny-back toad
Oh, I've finally decided my future lies
Beyond the yellow brick road

[Bridge]
Ah, ah ha ah ah
Ah ah ha[Verse 1]
There's a calm surrender to the rush of day
When the heat of a rolling wind can be turned away
An enchanted moment, and it sees me through
It's enough for this restless warrior just to be with you

[Chorus]
And can you feel the love tonight?
It is where we are
It's enough for this wide-eyed wanderer
That we got this far
And can you feel the love tonight?
How it's laid to rest
It's enough to make kings and vagabonds
Believe the very best

[Verse 2]
There's a time for everyone if they only learn
That the twistin' kaleidoscope moves us all in turn
There's a rhyme and reason to the wild outdoors
When the heart of this star-crossed voyager beats in time with yours

[Chorus]
And can you feel the love tonight?
It is where we are
It's enough for this wide-eyed wanderer
That we got this far
And can you feel the love tonight?
How it's laid to rest
It's enough to make kings and vagabonds
Believe the very best

[Outro]
It's enough to make kings and vagabonds
Believe the very best[Verse 1]
You could never know what it's like
Your blood, like winter, freezes just like ice
And there's a cold, lonely light that shines from you
You'll wind up like the wreck you hide behind that mask you use

[Verse 2]
And did you think this fool could never win?
Well look at me, I'm a-coming back again
I got a taste of love in a simple way
And if you need to know while I'm still standing
You just fade away

[Chorus]
Don't you know I'm still standing better than I ever did?
Looking like a true survivor, feeling like a little kid
And I'm still standing after all this time
Picking up the pieces of my life without you on my mind
I'm still standing (yeah, yeah, yeah)
I'm still standing (yeah, yeah, yeah)

[Verse 3]
Once, I never coulda hoped to win
You starting down the road, leaving me again
The threats you made were meant to cut me down
And if our love was just a circus, you'd be a clown by now

[Chorus]
You know I'm still standing better than I ever did
Looking like a true survivor, feeling like a little kid
And I'm still standing after all this time
Picking up the pieces of my life without you on my mind
I'm still standing (yeah, yeah, yeah)
I'm still standing (yeah, yeah, yeah)

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
Don't you know that I'm still standing better than I ever did?
Looking like a true survivor, feeling like a little kid
And I'm still standing after all this time
Picking up the pieces of my life without you on my mind
I'm still standing (yeah, yeah, yeah)
I'm still standing (yeah, yeah, yeah)

[Outro]
I'm still standing (yeah, yeah, yeah)
I'm still standing (yeah, yeah, yeah)
I'm still standing (yeah, yeah, yeah)
I'm still standing (yeah, yeah, yeah)[Verse 1]
Goodbye, Norma Jeane
Though I never knew you at all
You had the grace to hold yourself
While those around you crawled
They crawled out of the woodwork
And they whispered into your brain
They set you on the treadmill
And they made you change your name

[Chorus]
And it seems to me you lived your life
Like a candle in the wind
Never knowing who to cling to
When the rain set in
And I would've liked to know you
But I was just a kid
Your candle burned out long before
Your legend ever did

[Verse 2]
Loneliness was tough
The toughest role you ever played
Hollywood created a superstar
And pain was the price you paid
And even when you died
Oh, the press still hounded you
All the papers had to say
Was that Marilyn was found in the nude

[Chorus]
And it seems to me you lived your life
Like a candle in the wind
Never knowing who to cling to
When the rain set in
And I would've liked to know you
But I was just a kid
Your candle burned out long before
Your legend ever did

[Verse 3]
Goodbye, Norma Jeane
Though I never knew you at all
You had the grace to hold yourself
While those around you crawled
Goodbye, Norma Jeane
From the young man in the 22nd row
Who sees you as something more than sexual
More than just our Marilyn Monroe

[Chorus]
And it seems to me you lived your life
Like a candle in the wind
Never knowing who to cling to
When the rain set in
And I would've liked to know you
But I was just a kid
Your candle burned out long before
Your legend ever did

[Outro]
Your candle burned out long before
Your legend ever did[Verse 1: Elton John & Kiki Dee]
Don't go breaking my heart
I couldn't if I tried
Oh honey if I get restless
Baby you're not that kind
Don't go breaking my heart
You take the weight off of me
Oh honey when you knock on my door
Ooh, I gave you my key

[Pre-Chorus: Elton John, Kiki Dee & both]
Ooh, nobody knows it
When I was down
I was your clown
Ooh, nobody knows it (Nobody knows it)
Right from the start
I gave you my heart
Oh, I gave you my heart

[Chorus: Elton John, Kiki Dee & both]
So don't go breaking my heart
I won't go breaking your heart
Don't go breaking my heart

[Verse 2: Elton John & Kiki Dee]
And nobody told us
Because nobody showed us
And now it's up to us babe
Oh, I think we can make it
So don't misunderstand me
You put the light in my life
Oh, you put the spark to the flame
I've got your heart in my sights

[Pre-Chorus: Elton John, Kiki Dee & both]
Ooh, nobody knows it
When I was down
I was your clown
Ooh, nobody knows it (Nobody knows it)
Right from the start
I gave you my heart
Oh, I gave you my heart

[Chorus: Elton John, Kiki Dee & both]
Don't go breaking my heart
I won't go breaking your heart
Don't go breaking my heart

[Pre-Chorus: Elton John, Kiki Dee & both]
Ooh, nobody knows it
When I was down
I was your clown
Right from the start
I gave you my heart
Oh, I gave you my heart

[Chorus: Elton John, Kiki Dee & both]
Don't go breaking my heart
I won't go breaking your heart
Don't go breaking my
Don't go breaking my
Don't go breaking my heart
Don't go breaking my
Don't go breaking my
I won't go breaking your heart
Don't go breaking my heart
Don't go breaking my
I won't go breaking your heart
Don't go breaking my heart
Don't go breaking my
I won't go breaking your heart
Don't go breaking my heart
Don't go breaking my
I won't go breaking your heart
Don't go breaking my heart
Don't go breaking my
I won't go breaking your heart
Don't go breaking my heart
Don't go breaking my
I won't go breaking your heart
Don't go breaking my heart[Verse 1]
It's getting late, have you seen my mates?
Ma, tell me when the boys get here
It's seven o'clock and I wanna rock
Wanna get a belly full of beer
My old man's drunker than a barrel full of monkeys
And my old lady, she don't care
My sister looks cute in her braces and boots
A handful of grease in her hair

[Chorus]
Oh, don't give us none of your aggravation
We had it with your discipline
Oh, Saturday night's alright for fighting
Get a little action in
Get about as oiled as a diesel train
Gonna set this dance alight
'Cause Saturday night's the night I like
Saturday night's alright, alright, alright, ooh

[Verse 2]
Well, they're packed pretty tight in here tonight
I'm looking for a dolly who'll see me right
I may use a little muscle to get what I need
I may sink a little drink and shout out, "She's with me!"
A couple of the sounds that I really like
Are the sounds of a switchblade and a motorbike
I'm a juvenile product of the working class
Whose best friend floats in the bottom of a glass

[Chorus]
Oh, don't give us none of your aggravation
We had it with your discipline
Saturday night's alright for fighting
Get a little action in
Get about as oiled as a diesel train
Gonna set this dance alight
'Cause Saturday night's the night I like
Saturday night's alright, alright, alright, ooh

[Guitar break]

[Chorus]
Oh, don't give us none of your aggravation
We had it with your discipline
'Cause Saturday night's alright for fighting
Get a little action in
Get about as oiled as a diesel train
Gonna set this dance alight
'Cause Saturday night's the night I like
Saturday night's alright, alright, alright, ooh

[Outro]
Saturday! Saturday! Saturday!
Saturday! Saturday! Saturday!
Saturday! Saturday! Saturday night's alright
Saturday! Saturday! Saturday!
Saturday! Saturday! Saturday!
Saturday! Saturday! Saturday night's alright
Saturday! Saturday! Saturday!
Saturday! Saturday! Saturday!
Saturday! Saturday! Saturday night's alright, whoo[Verse 1]
I remember when rock was young
Me and Susie had so much fun
Holding hands and skimming stones
Had an old gold Chevy and a place of my own
But the biggest kick I ever got
Was doing a thing called the Crocodile Rock
While the other kids were rocking 'round the clock
We were hopping and bopping to the Crocodile Rock

[Chorus]
Well, Crocodile Rocking is something shocking
When your feet just can't keep still
I never knew me a better time, and I guess I never will
Oh, lawdy mama, those Friday nights
When Susie wore her dresses tight
And the Crocodile Rocking was out of sight

[Post-Chorus]
Laa, la-la-la-la-laa
La-la-la-la-laa
La-la-la-la-laa

[Verse 2]
But the years went by and the rock just died
Susie went and left us for some foreign guy
Long nights crying by the record machine
Dreaming of my Chevy and my old blue jeans
But they'll never kill the thrills we've got
Burning up to the Crocodile Rock
Learning fast as the weeks went past
We really thought the Crocodile Rock would last

[Chorus]
Well, Crocodile Rocking is something shocking
When your feet just can't keep still
I never knew me a better time, and I guess I never will
Oh, lawdy mama, those Friday nights
When Susie wore her dresses tight
And the Crocodile Rocking was out of sight

[Post-Chorus]
Laa, la-la-la-la-laa
La-la-la-la-laa
La-la-la-la-laa

Don't wish it away
Don't look at it like it's forever
Between you and me, I could honestly say
That things can only get better

[Pre-Chorus]
And while I'm away
Dust out the demons inside
And it won't be long before you and me run
To the place in our hearts where we hide

[Chorus]
And I guess that's why they call it the blues
Time on my hands could be time spent with you
Laughin' like children, livin' like lovers
Rollin' like thunder under the covers
And I guess that's why they call it the blues

[Verse 2]
Just stare into space
Picture my face in your hands
Live for each second without hesitation
And never forget I'm your man

[Pre-Chorus]
Wait on me, girl
Cry in the night if it helps
But more than ever, I simply love you
More than I love life itself

[Chorus]
And I guess that's why they call it the blues
Time on my hands could be time spent with you
Laughin' like children, livin' like lovers
Rollin' like thunder under the covers
And I guess that's why they call it the blues

[Harmonica solo: Stevie Wonder]

[Pre-Chorus]
Wait on me, girl
Cry in the night if it helps
But more than ever, I simply love you
More than I love life itself

[Chorus]
And I guess that's why they call it the blues
Time on my hands could be time spent with you
Laughin' like children, livin' like lovers
Rollin' like thunder under the covers
And I guess that's why they call it the blues

[Outro]
(Laughing like children, living like lovers)
And I guess that's why they call it the blues
(Laughing like children, living like lovers)
And I guess that's why they call it the blues
And I guess that's why they call it the blues[Verse 1]
I can't light no more of your darkness
All my pictures seem to fade to black and white
I'm growin' tired, and time stands still before me
Frozen here on the ladder of my life

[Verse 2]
Too late to save myself from falling
I took a chance and changed your way of life
But you misread my meanin' when I met you
Closed the door and left me blinded by the light

[Chorus]
Don't let the sun go down on me
Although I search myself, it's always someone else I see
I'd just allow a fragment of your life to wander free
But losin' everything is like the sun goin' down on me

[Verse 3]
I can't find, oh, the right romantic line
But see me once and see the way I feel
Don't discard me just because you think I mean you harm
But these cuts I have, oh, they need love to help them heal

[Chorus]
Don't let the sun go down on me
Although I search myself, it's always someone else I see
I'd just allow a fragment of your life to wander free
But losin' everything is like the sun goin' down on me

[Chorus]
Don't let the sun go down on me
Although I search myself, it's always someone else I see
I'd just allow a fragment of your life to wander free, yeah
But losin' everything is like the sun goin' down on me[Verse 1]
Goodbye England's rose
May you ever grow in our hearts
You were the grace that placed itself
Where lives were torn apart
You called out to our country
And you whispered to those in pain
Now you belong to heaven
And the stars spell out your name

[Chorus]
And it seems to me you lived your life
Like a candle in the wind
Never fading with the sunset
When the rain set in
And your footsteps will always fall here
Along England's greenest hills
Your candle's burned out long before
Your legend ever will

[Verse 2]
Loveliness we've lost
These empty days without your smile
This torch, we'll always carry
For our nation's golden child
And even though we try
The truth brings us to tears
All our words cannot express
The joy you brought us through the years

[Chorus]
And it seems to me you lived your life
Like a candle in the wind
Never fading with the sunset
When the rain set in
And your footsteps will always fall here
Along England's greenest hills
Your candle's burned out long before
Your legend ever will

[Verse 3]
Goodbye England's rose
May you ever grow in our hearts
You were the grace that placed yourselves
Where lives were torn apart
Goodbye England's rose
From a country lost without your soul
Who'll miss the wings of your compassion
More than you will ever know

[Chorus]
And it seems to me you lived your life
Like a candle in the wind
Never fading with the sunset
When the rain set in
And your footsteps will always fall here
Along England's greenest hills
Your candle's burned out long before
Your legend ever will

[Outro]
And your footsteps will always fall here
Along England's greenest hills
Your candle's burned out long before
Your legend ever will[Verse 1]
Daniel is travelin' tonight on a plane
I can see the red taillights headin' for Spain
Oh, and I can see Daniel wavin' goodbye
God, it looks like Daniel
Must be the clouds in my eyes

[Verse 2]
They say Spain is pretty, though I've never been
And Daniel says it's the best place he's ever seen
Oh, and he should know, he's been there enough
Lord, I miss Daniel
Oh, I miss him so much

[Chorus]
Oh, Daniel, my brother, you are older than me
Do you still feel the pain of the scars that won't heal?
Your eyes have died, but you see more than I
Daniel, you're a star in the face of the sky

[Chorus]
Oh, Daniel, my brother, you are older than me
Do you still feel the pain of the scars that won't heal?
Your eyes have died, but you see more than I
Daniel, you're a star in the face of the sky

[Verse 1]
Daniel is travelin' tonight on a plane
I can see the red taillights headin' for Spain
Oh, and I can see Daniel wavin' goodbye
God, it looks like Daniel
Must be the clouds in my eyes

[Outro]
Oh God, it looks like Daniel
Must be the clouds in my eyes[Verse 1]
It's a human sign
When things go wrong
When the scent of her lingers
And temptation's strong
Into the boundary
Of each married man
Sweet deceit comes callin'
And negativity lands

[Chorus]
Cold, cold heart
Hardened by you
Some things look better, baby
Just passin' through
And it's no sacrifice
Just a simple word
It's two hearts livin'
In two separate worlds
But it's no sacrifice
No sacrifice
It's no sacrifice at all

[Verse 2]
Mutual misunderstandin'
After the fact
Sensitivity builds a prison
In the final act
We lose direction
No stone unturned
No tears to damn you
When jealousy burns

[Chorus]
Cold, cold heart
Hardened by you
Some things look better, baby
Just passin' through
And it's no sacrifice
Just a simple word
It's two hearts livin'
In two separate worlds
But it's no sacrifice
No sacrifice
It's no sacrifice at all

[Chorus]
Cold, cold heart
Hardened by you
Some things look better, baby
Just passin' through
And it's no sacrifice
Just a simple word
It's two hearts livin'
In two separate worlds
But it's no sacrifice
No sacrifice
It's no sacrifice at all

[Outro]
No sacrifice at all
No sacrifice at all
No sacrifice at all
No sacrifice at all[Verse 1]
Levon bears his war wound like a crown
He calls his child Jesus
'Cause he likes the name
And he sends him to the finest school in town
Levon, Levon likes his money
He makes a lot, they say
Spends his days countin'
In a garage by the motorway

[Pre-Chorus]
He was born a pauper to a pawn
On a Christmas day
When the New York Times said
"God is dead and the War's begun"
Alvin Tostig has a son today

[Chorus]
And he shall be Levon
And he shall be a good man
And he shall be Levon
In tradition with the family plan
And he shall be Levon
And he shall be a good man
He shall be Levon

[Verse 2]
Levon sells cartoon balloons in town
His family business thrives
Jesus blows up balloons all day
Sits on the porch swing, watchin' them fly
And Jesus, he wants to go to Venus
Leave Levon far behind
Take a balloon and go sailin'
While Levon, Levon slowly dies

[Pre-Chorus]
He was born a pauper to a pawn
On a Christmas day
When the New York Times said
"God is dead and the War's begun"
Alvin Tostig has a son today

[Chorus]
And he shall be Levon
And he shall be a good man
And he shall be Levon
In tradition with the family plan
Whoo, and he shall be Levon
And he shall be a good man
He shall be Levon

[Chorus]
And he shall be Levon
And he shall be a good man
And he shall be Levon
In tradition with the family plan
Whoo, and he shall be Levon
And he shall be a good man
He shall be Levon[Verse 1]
And now I know
"Spanish Harlem" are not just pretty words to say
I thought I knew
But now I know that rose trees never grow
In New York City

[Pre-Chorus]
Until you've seen this trash can dream come true
You stand at the edge while people run you through
And I thank the Lord there's people out there like you
I thank the Lord there's people out there like you

[Chorus]
While Mona Lisas and mad hatters
Sons of bankers, sons of lawyers
Turn around and say, "Good morning" to the night
For unless they see the sky
But they can't, and that is why
They know not if it's dark outside or light

[Verse 2]
This Broadway's got
It's got a lot of songs to sing
If I knew the tunes, I might join in
I'd go my way alone
I'd grow my own, my own seeds shall be sown in New York City

[Pre-Chorus]
Subway's no way for a good man to go down
Rich man can ride, and the hobo, he can drown
And I thank the Lord for the people I have found
I thank the Lord for the people I have found

[Chorus]
While Mona Lisas and mad hatters
Sons of bankers, sons of lawyers
Turn around and say, "Good morning" to the night
For unless they see the sky
But they can't, and that is why
They know not if it's dark outside or light

[Verse 1]
And now I know
"Spanish Harlem" are not just pretty words to say
I thought I knew
But now I know that rose trees never grow
In New York City

[Pre-Chorus]
Subway's no way for a good man to go down
Rich man can ride, and the hobo, he can drown
And I thank the Lord for the people I have found
I thank the Lord for the people I have found

While Mona Lisas and mad hatters
Sons of bankers, sons of lawyers
Turn around and say, "Good morning" to the night
For unless they see the sky
But they can't, and that is why
They know not if it's dark outside or light

[Outro]
They know not if it's dark outside or light[Verse 1]
When I think of those East End lights, muggy nights
The curtains drawn in the little room downstairs
Prima Donna, lord, you really shoulda been there
Sittin' like a princess perched in her electric chair
And it's one more beer, and I don't hear you anymore
We've all gone crazy lately
My friend's out there, rollin' 'round the basement floor (Ooh)

[Chorus]
And someone saved my life tonight, sugar bear (sugar bear)
You almost had your hooks in me, didn't you, dear?
You nearly had me roped and tied
Altar-bound, hypnotized, sweet freedom whispered in my ear
You're a butterfly, and butterflies are free to fly
Fly away, high away, bye-bye (Ooh)

[Piano riff]

[Verse 2]
I never realized the passin' hours of evening showers
A slip noose hangin' in my darkest dreams
I'm strangled by your haunted social scene
Just a pawn out-played by a dominating queen
It's four o'clock in the morning, damn it! Listen to me good
I'm sleepin' with myself tonight
Saved in time, thank God my music's still alive
(Oh!)

[Chorus]
Someone saved my life tonight, sugar bear
(Sugar bear, sugar bear)
You almost had your hooks in me, didn't you, dear?
You nearly had me roped and tied
Altar-bound, hypnotized, sweet freedom whispered in my ear
You're a butterfly, and butterflies are free to fly
Fly away, high away, bye-bye (Ooh)

[Piano riff]

[Bridge]
And I would've walked head-on into the deep end of the river
Clingin' to your stocks and bonds
Payin' your H.P. demands forever
They're comin' in the mornin' with a truck to take me home
Someone saved my life tonight
Someone saved my life tonight
Someone saved my life tonight
Someone saved my life tonight
Someone saved my life tonight
So save your strength, and run the field you play alone

[Chorus]
Someone saved my life tonight, sugar bear
(Sugar bear, sugar bear, sugar bear)
You almost had your hooks in me, didn't you, dear?
You nearly had me roped and tied
Altar-bound, hypnotized, sweet freedom whispered in my ear
You're a butterfly, and butterflies are free to fly
Fly away, high away, bye-bye

[Outro]
Someone saved, someone saved, someone saved my life tonight
(Someone saved my life tonight)
Someone saved, someone saved, someone saved my life tonight
(Someone saved my life tonight)
Someone saved, someone saved, someone saved my life tonight
(Someone saved my life tonight)
Someone saved, someone saved, someone saved my life tonight
(Someone saved my life tonight)
Someone saved, someone saved, someone saved my life tonight
(Someone saved my life tonight)
Someone saved, someone saved, someone saved my life tonight
(Someone saved my life tonight)
Someone saved, someone saved, someone saved my life tonight
(Someone saved my life tonight)[Verse 1]
When I look back, boy, I must have been green
Bopping in the country, fishing in a stream
Looking for an answer, trying to find a sign
Until I saw your city lights, honey, I was blind

[Chorus 1]
They said, get back, honky cat
Better get back to the woods
Well, I quit those days and my redneck ways
And, oh, change is gonna do me good
You better get back, honky cat
Living in the city ain't where it's at
It's like trying to find gold in a silver mine
It's like trying to drink whisky, oh, from a bottle of wine

[Verse 2]
Well, I read some books and I read some magazines
About those high-class ladies down in New Orleans
And all the folks back home, well, said I was a fool
They said, oh, "Believe in the Lord" is the golden rule

[Chorus 2]
They said, get back, honky cat
Better get back to the woods
But I quit those days and my redneck ways
And, ooh, oh, change is gonna do me good
(Ooh, baby)
They said, get back, honky cat
Better get back to the woods
Well, I quit those days and my redneck ways
And, oh, oh, change is gonna do me good

[Verse 3]
They said, stay at home, boy, you gotta tend the farm
Living in the city, boy, is, is gonna break your heart
But how can you stay when your heart says no
Ha, how can you stop when your feet say go

[Chorus 1]
You better get back, honky cat
Better get back to the woods
Well, I quit those days and my redneck ways
And, ooh, oh, the change is gonna do me good
You better get back, honky cat
Living in the city ain't where it's at
It's like trying to find gold in a silver mine
It's like trying to drink whisky, oh, from a bottle of wine

[Outro]
Oh yeah, get back, honky cat
Get back, honky cat, get back, whoo
Get back, honky cat
Get back, honky cat, get back, whoo
Oh, get back, honky cat, get back
Get back, honky cat, whoo
Oh yeah, redneck ways and
Whoo[Verse 1]
I was justified when I was five
Raising Cain, I spit in your eye
Times are changing, now the poor get fat
But the fever's gonna catch you when the bitch gets back (oh)

[Verse 2]
Eat meat on Friday, that's alright
I even like steak on a Saturday night
I can bitch the best at your social do's
I get high in the evening sniffing pots of glue, ooh

[Chorus]
I'm a bitch, I'm a bitch, oh, the bitch is back
Stone-cold sober, as a matter of fact
I can bitch, I can bitch 'cause I'm better than you
It's the way that I move, the things that I do, oh

[Verse 3]
I entertain by picking brains
Sell my soul by dropping names
I don't like those, my God, what's that?
Oh, it's full of nasty habits when the bitch gets back (oh)

[Chorus]
I'm a bitch, I'm a bitch, oh, the bitch is back
Stone-cold sober, as a matter of fact
I can bitch, I can bitch 'cause I'm better than you
It's the way that I move, the things that I do, oh
(Oh)

[Saxophone Solo]

[Chorus]
I'm a bitch, I'm a bitch, oh, the bitch is back
Stone-cold sober, as a matter of fact
I can bitch, I can bitch 'cause I'm better than you
It's the way that I move, the things that I do, oh

[Outro]
Bitch, bitch, bitch is back
Bitch, bitch, bitch is back
Bitch, bitch, bitch is back
Bitch, bitch, bitch is back
Bitch, bitch, bitch is back
Bitch, bitch, bitch is back
Bitch, bitch, bitch is back
Bitch, bitch, bitch is back[Verse 1]
What have I gotta do to make you love me?
What have I gotta do to make you care?
What do I do when lightning strikes me?
And I wake to find that you're not there

[Verse 2]
What do I do to make you want me?
What have I gotta do to be heard?
What do I say when it's all over?
And sorry seems to be the hardest word

[Chorus]
It's sad, (so sad) so sad
It's a sad, sad situation
And it's getting more and more absurd
It's sad, (so sad) so sad
Why can't we talk it over?
Oh, it seems to me
That sorry seems to be the hardest word

[Chorus]
It's sad, (so sad) so sad
It's a sad, sad situation
And it's getting more and more absurd
It's sad, (so sad) so sad
Why can't we talk it over?
Oh, it seems to me
That sorry seems to be the hardest word

[Verse 3]
What do I do to make you love me?
Oh, what have I gotta do to be heard?
What do I do when lightning strikes me?
What have I gotta do?
What have I gotta do?
Ooh, and sorry seems to be the hardest word[Verse 1]
I saw you dancin' out the ocean
Runnin' fast along the sand
A spirit born of earth and water
Fire flyin' from your hands
In the instant that you love someone
In the second that the hammer hits
Reality runs up your spine
And the pieces finally fit

[Chorus]
And all I ever needed was the one
Like freedom fields, where wild horses run
When stars collide like you and I
No shadows block the sun
You're all I've ever needed
Baby, you're the one

[Verse 2]
There are caravans we follow
Drunken nights in dark hotels
When chances breathe between the silence
Where sex and love no longer gel, oh
For each man, in his time, is Cain
Until he walks along the beach
And sees his future in the water
A long, lost heart within his reach

[Chorus]
And all I ever needed was the one
Like freedom fields, where wild horses run
When stars collide like you and I
No shadows block the sun
You're all I've ever needed
Ooh, baby, you're the one

[Chorus]
And all I ever needed was the one
Like freedom fields, where wild horses run
When stars collide like you and I
No shadows block the sun
Oh, you're all I ever needed
Ooh, baby, you're the one

[Chorus]
All I ever needed was the one
Like freedom fields, where wild horses run
When stars collide like you and I
No shadows block the sun
Oh, you're all I ever needed
Ooh, baby, you're the one[Verse 1]
I used to be a rollin' stone, you know
If a cause was right
I'd leave to find the answer on the road
I used to be a heart beatin' for someone
But the times have changed
The less I say, the more my work gets done

[Chorus]
'Cause I live and breathe this Philadelphia freedom
From the day that I was born, I've waved the flag
Philadelphia freedom took me knee--high to a man, yeah
Gave me peace of mind my daddy never had

[Post-Chorus]
Oh, Philadelphia freedom, shine on me, I love ya
Shine the light through the eyes of the ones left behind
Shine the light, shine the light
Shine the light, won't you shine the light?
Philadelphia freedom, I lo-o-ove ya
Yes, I do

[Verse 2]
If you choose to, you can live your life alone
Some people choose the city (Some people choose the city)
Some others choose the good old family home
(Some others choose the good old family home)
I like livin' easy without family ties ('Livin easy)
Til the whippoorwill of freedom zapped me
Right between the eyes

[Chorus]
'Cause I live and breathe this Philadelphia freedom
From the day that I was born, I've waved the flag
Philadelphia freedom took me knee-high to a man
Gave me peace of mind my daddy never had

[Post-Chorus]
Oh, Philadelphia freedom, shine on me, I love ya
Shine the light through the eyes of the ones left behind
Shine the light, shine the light
Shine the light, won't you shine the light?
Philadelphia freedom, I lo-o-ove ya, yes I do

[Post-Chorus]
Oh, Philadelphia freedom, shine on me
I love ya
Shine the light through the eyes of the ones left behind
Shine the light, shine the light
Shine the light, won't you shine the light?
Philadelphia freedom, I lo-o-ove ya
You know I lo-o-ove ya, yeah
You know I lo-o-ove you, yes I do!

[Outro]
(Philadelphia freedom)
I lo-o-ove you, yes I do, Philadelphia freedom
You know that I lo-o-ove you, yes I do!
(Philadelphia freedom)
Oh, don't you know that I lo-o-ove you, yes I do!
(Philadelphia freedom)
Don't you know that I lo-o-ove you, yes I do!
(Philadelphia freedom)
Don't you know that I lo-o-ove you, yes I do![Spoken AUDITIONER WOMAN]
Can I just ask you, Billy
What does it feel like when you're dancing?

[BILLY]
I can't really explain it
I haven't got the words
It's a feeling that you can't control
I suppose it's like forgetting, losing who you are
And at the same time something makes you whole

It's like that there's a music playing in your ear
And I'm listening, and I'm listening and then I disappear
And then I feel a change
Like a fire deep inside
Something bursting me wide open impossible to hide
And suddenly I'm flying, flying like a bird
Like electricity, electricity
Sparks inside of me
And I'm free I'm free

It's a bit like being angry
It's a bit like being scared
Confused and all mixed up and mad as hell
It's like when you've been crying
And you're empty and you're full
I don't know what it is, it's hard to tell

It's like that there's a music playing in your ear
But the music is impossible, impossible to hear
But then I feel it move me
Like a burning deep inside
Something bursting me wide open impossible to hide
And suddenly I'm flying, flying like a bird
Like electricity, electricity
Sparks inside of me
And I'm free I'm free

Electricity, sparks inside of me
And I'm free, I'm free
I'm free. Free I'm free{Funeral for a Friend}
[Instrumental]

{Love Lies Bleeding}
[Verse 1]
The roses in the window box have tilted to one side
Everything about this house was born to grow and die
Oh, it doesn't seem a year ago to this very day
You said, "I'm sorry, honey, if I don't change the pace
I can't face another day"

[Chorus]
And love lies bleedin' in my hands
Oh, it kills me to think of you with another man
I was playin' rock and roll, and you were just a fan
But my guitar couldn't hold you, so I split the band
Love lies bleedin' in my hands

[Verse 2]
I wonder if those changes have left a scar on you
Like all the burnin' hoops of fire that you and I passed through
You're a bluebird on a telegraph line, I hope you're happy now
Well, if the wind of change comes down your way, girl
You'll make it back somehow

[Chorus]
And love lies bleedin' in my hands
Oh, it kills me to think of you with another man
I was playin' rock and roll, and you were just a fan
But my guitar couldn't hold you, so I split the band
Love lies bleedin' in my hands

[Chorus]
And love lies bleedin' in my hands
Oh, it kills me to think of you with another man
I was playin' rock and roll, and you were just a fan
But my guitar couldn't hold you, so I split the band
Love lies bleedin' in my hands

[Outro]
Oh!
Oh!
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Love lies bleedin' in my hands
Ooh-hoo! Ooh-hoo! Ooh-hoo!
Ooh-hoo! Ooh-hoo! Ooh-hoo!
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh!
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh![Verse 1]
Holy Moses, I have been removed
I have seen the spectre, he has been here too
Distant cousin from down the line
Brand of people who ain't my kind
Holy Moses, I have been removed

[Verse 2]
Holy Moses, I have been deceived
Now the wind has changed direction, and I'll have to leave
Won't you please excuse my frankness
But it's not my cup of tea
Holy Moses, I have been deceived

[Bridge]
I'm going back to the border where my affairs
My affairs ain't abused
I can't take any more bad water
Been poisoned from my head down to my shoes, oh
Holy Moses, I have been deceived

[Verse 3]
Holy Moses, let us live in peace
Let us strive to find a way to make all hatred cease
There's a man over there, what's his color? I don't care
He's my brother, let us live in peace, oh
He's my brother, let us live in peace, oh
He's my brother, let us, let us live in peace[Verse 1]
Raised to be a lady by the golden rule
Alice was the spawn of a public school
With a double barrel name in the back of her brain
And a simple case of mummy-doesn't-love-me blues
Reality it seems was just a dream
She couldn't get it on with the boys on the scene

[Pre-Chorus]
But what do you expect from a chick who's just sixteen
And hey, hey, hey (hey, hey, hey)
You know what I mean

[Chorus]
All the young girls love Alice
Tender young Alice, they say
Come over and see me
Come over and please me
Alice, it's my turn today
All the young girls love Alice
Tender young Alice they say
If I give you my number
Will you promise to call me?
Wait till my husband's away

[Verse 2]
Poor little darling with a chip out of her heart
It's like acting in a movie when you got the wrong part
Getting your kicks in another girl's bed
And it was only last Tuesday
Oh, they found you in the subway dead
And who could you call your friends down in SoHo
One or two middle-aged dykes in a go-go

[Pre-Chorus]
But what do you expect from a 16-year-old yo-yo?
And hey, hey, hey (hey, hey, hey)
Oh, dont you know?

[Chorus]
All the young girls love Alice
Tender young Alice, they say
Come over and see me
Come over and please me
Alice, it's my turn today
All the young girls love Alice
Tender young Alice, they'd say
If I give you my number
Will you promise to call me?
Wait till my husband's away[Verse 1]
I'm getting bored
Being part of mankind
There's not a lot to do no more
This race is a waste of time
People rushing everywhere
Swarming around like flies
Think I'll buy a .44
Give 'em all a surprise

[Chorus]
I think I'm gonna kill myself
Cause a little suicide
Stick around for a couple of days
What a scandal if I died
Yeah, I'm gonna kill myself
Get a little headline news
I'd like to see what the papers say
On the state of teenage blues

[Verse 2]
A rift in my family
I can't use the car
I gotta be in by ten o'clock
Who do they think they are?
I'd make an exception
If you wanna save my life
Brigitte Bardot gotta come
And see me every night

[Chorus]
I think I'm gonna kill myself
Cause a little suicide
Stick around for a couple of days
What a scandal if I died
Yeah, I'm gonna kill myself
Get a little headline news
I'd like to see what the papers say
On the state of teenage blues

[Piano Solo]

[Outro]
On the state of teenage blues
Kill myself
Suicide
What a scandal if I die
Suicide
Headline news
On the state of teenage blues[Verse 1]
I can see very well
There's a boat on the reef with a broken back
And I can see it very well
There's a joke and I know it very well
It's one of those that I told you long ago
Take my word, I'm a madman, don't you know

[Verse 2]
Once a fool had a good part in the play
If it's so would I still be here today?
It's quite peculiar in a funny sort of way
They think it's very funny everything I say
Get a load of him, he's so insane
You better get your coat, dear, it looks like rain

[Chorus]
We'll come again next Thursday afternoon
The In-laws hope they'll see you very soon
But is it in your conscience that you're after
Another glimpse of the Madman across the Water

[Verse 1]
I can see very well
There's a boat on the reef with a broken back
And I can see it very well
There's a joke and I know it very well
It's one of those that I told you long ago
Take my word, I'm a madman, don't you know

[Verse 3]
The ground's a long way down but I need more
Is the nightmare black or are the windows painted?
Will they come again next week, can my mind really take it?

[Chorus]
We'll come again next Thursday afternoon
The In-laws hope they'll see you very soon
But is it in your conscience that you're after
Another glimpse of the Madman across the Water[Verse 1]
I want love, but it's impossible
A man like me, so irresponsible
A man like me is dead in places
Other men feel liberated

[Verse 2]
And I can't love, shot full of holes
Don't feel nothing, I just feel cold
Don't feel nothing, just old scars
Toughening up around my heart

[Chorus]
But I want love, just a different kind
I want love, won't break me down
Won't brick me up, won't fence me in
I want a love that don't mean a thing
That's the love I want, I want love

[Verse 3]
I want love on my own terms
After everything I've ever learned
Me, I carry too much baggage
Oh man, I've seen so much traffic

[Chorus]
But I want love, just a different kind
I want love, won't break me down
Won't brick me up, won't fence me in
I want a love that don't mean a thing
That's the love I want, I want love

[Bridge]
So bring it on, I've been bruised
Don't give me love that's clean and smooth
I'm ready for the rougher stuff
No sweet romance, I've had enough
A man like me is dead in places
Other men feel liberated

[Chorus]
But I want love, just a different kind
I want love, won't break me down
Won't brick me up, won't fence me in
I want a love that don't mean a thing
That's the love I want, I want love

[Chorus]
I want love, just a different kind
I want love, won't break me down
Won't brick me up, won't fence me in
I want a love that don't mean a thing
That's the love I want, I want love[Verse 1]
If you feel that it's real, I'm on trial
And I'm here, yeah, in your prison
Like a coin in your mint
I am dented and I'm spent with high treason

[Pre-Chorus]
Through a glass eye, your throne
Is the one danger zone
Take me to the pilot for control
Take me to the pilot of your soul

[Chorus]
Take me to the pilot, lead me through the chamber
Take me to the pilot, I am but a stranger
Take me to the pilot, lead me through the chamber
Take me to the pilot, I am but a stranger

[Post-Chorus]
Na na na, na na na
Na na na, na-na-na na na
Na na na, na na na
Na na na, na-na-na na na

[Verse 2]
Well, I know he's not old
And I'm told, and I'm told he's a virgin
Or he may be she
What I'm told is never, never for certain

[Pre-Chorus]
Through a glass eye, your throne
Is the one danger zone
Take me to the pilot for control
Take me to the pilot of your soul

[Chorus]
Yeah, yeah, take me to the pilot, lead me through the chamber
Take me to the pilot, I am but a stranger
Take me to the pilot, lead me through the chamber
Take me to the pilot, I am but a stranger

[Post-Chorus]
Na na na, na na na
Na na na, na-na-na na na
Na na na, na na na
Na na na, na-na-na na na

[Pre-Chorus]
Through a glass eye, your throne
Is the one danger zone
Take me to the pilot for control
Take me to the pilot of your soul

[Chorus]
Take me to the pilot, lead me through the chamber
Take me to the pilot, I am but a stranger
Take me to the pilot, lead me through the chamber
Take me to the pilot, I am but a stranger

Ever since I was a young boy, I played the silver ball
From Soho down to Brighton, I must've played them all
But I ain't seen nothin' like him in any amusement hall
That deaf, dumb, and blind kid sure plays a mean pinball

[Verse 2]
He stands like a statue, becomes part of the machine
Feeling all the bumpers, always playing clean
He plays by intuition, the digit counters fall
That deaf, dumb, and blind kid sure plays a mean pinball

[Chorus 1]
He's a pinball wizard, there has to be a twist
A pinball wizard's got such a supple wrist

[Post-Chorus]
(How do you think he does it?) I don't know
(What makes him so good?)

[Verse 3]
Well, he ain't got no distractions, can't hear no buzzes and bells
Don't see lights a-flashin', he plays by sense of smell
Always has a replay, never tilts at all
That deaf, dumb, and blind kid sure plays a mean pinball

[Chorus 2]
He can't beat me now, I've always been the champ
I know every trick, no freak's gonna beat my hand

[Bridge]
(Oh, can't explain)
(Oh, can't explain)
(Oh, can't explain)
(Oh, can't explain)

[Verse 4]
Even on my usual table, he can beat the best
His disciples lead him in, and he just does the rest
He's got crazy flipper fingers, I've never seen him fall
That deaf, dumb, and blind kid sure plays a mean pinball

[Chorus 1]
He's a pinball wizard, there has to be a twist
A pinball wizard's got such a supple wrist

[Chorus 3]
He's a pinball wizard, he scores a trillion more
A pinball wizard, the world's new pinball lord
He's scoring more, he's scoring more

[Chorus 4]
I thought I was the Bally table king
But I just handed my pinball crown to him
To him, to him[Verse 1]
Hey Nikita, is it cold
In your little corner of the world?
You could roll around the globe
And never find a warmer soul to know
Oh, I saw you by the wall
Ten of your tin soldiers in a row
With eyes that looked like ice on fire
The human heart, a captive in the snow

[Chorus]
Oh, Nikita, you will never know
Anythin' about my home
I'll never know how good it feels to hold you
Nikita, I need you so
Oh, Nikita, is the other side of any given line in time
Countin' ten tin soldiers in a row
Oh no, Nikita, you'll never know

[Verse 2]
Do you ever dream of me?
And do you ever see the letters that I write?
When you look up through the wire
Nikita, do you count the stars at night?
And if there comes a time
Guns and gates no longer hold you in
And if you're free to make a choice
Just look towards the west and find a friend

[Chorus]
Oh, Nikita, you will never know
Anythin' about my home
I'll never know how good it feels to hold you
Nikita, I need you so
Oh, Nikita, is the other side of any given line in time
Countin' ten tin soldiers in a row
Oh no, Nikita, you'll never know

[Chorus]
Oh, Nikita, you will never know
Never know anythin' about my home
I'll never know how good it feels to hold you
Nikita, I need you so
Oh, Nikita, is the other side of any given line in time
Countin' ten tin soldiers in a row
Oh no, Nikita, you'll never know

[Outro]
(Nikita) countin' ten tin soldiers in a row
(Nikita) countin' ten tin soldiers in a row
(Nikita) countin' ten tin soldiers in a row[AMNERIS]
In life, one has to face a huge assortment
Of nauseating fads and good advice
There's health, and fitness, diet, and deportment
And other pointless forms of sacrifice
Conversation? Wit? I am a doubter
Manners? Charm? They're no way to impress
So forget the inner me, observe the outer
I am what I wear and how I dress

Oh, now I believe in lookin'
Like my time on earth is cookin'
Whether polka dotted, striped or even checked
With some glamour guaranteeing
Every fiber on of my being
Is displayed to quite remarkable effect

From your cradle via trousseau
To your deathbed you're on view, so
Never compromise, accept no substitute
I would rather wear a barrel
Than conservative apparel
For my dress has always been...my strongest suit

(Overwear, underwear, anytime, anywhere)

Staying in or hitting town-wards
From the top and working downwards
I ensure that every stitch is stitched in time (Is stitched in time)
Whether wig or hat or turban
Whether clad boudoir or urban
Not to strut your stuff outrageously is a crime (It's such a crime)

And the few who are invited (Overwear)
To my wardrobe are delighted (Underwear)
As they wander through my things (Anytime)
To find en route (We're wandering through your things)
That in negligee or formal (Negligee)
I am anything but normal (Anything but normal)
And dress has always been my strongest suit

(Overwear, underwear, anytime, anywhere)
(Overwear, underwear, anytime, anywhere)
I am what I wear
(Overwear, underwear, anytime, anywhere)
I said anytime...
(Overwear, underwear, anytime, anywhere)
Anywhere

So bring me all my finest (Finest)
Most audacious, my divinest (Divinest)
Most revealing, most expensive and to boot (Most revealing, most expensive)
(Most arresting) Most arresting
(Most heartstopping) Most heartstopping
Most free-flowing (Overwear)
Most eye-popping (Underwear)
Most arresting (Anytime)
Most heartstopping, yeah (Anywhere)
Dress has always been my strongest suit!

(I am what I wear)
My strongest suit
(I am what I wear)
You know that I am what I wear
(I am what I wear)
Dress has always been my strongest suit!

So bring me all my finest (My finest)
Most audacious, my divinest (Divinest)
Most revealing, most expensive and to boot (Most revealing, most expensive)
Most arresting, most heartstopping
Most free-flowing, most eye-popping
Dress has always been my strongest suit!

(I am what I wear)
My strongest suit
(I am what I wear)
You know that I am what I wear
Dress has always been my strongest
My strongest, my strongest
My strongest, my strongest
My strongest suit![Verse 1]
From the day we arrive on the planet
And blinking, step into the sun
There's more to see than can ever be seen
More to do than can ever be done
Some say, "Eat or be eaten"
Some say, "Live and let live"
But all are agreed as they join the stampede
You should never take more than you give

[Chorus]
In the circle of life
It's the wheel of fortune
It's the leap of faith
It's the band of hope
Till we find our place
On the path unwinding
In the circle, the circle of life

[Verse 2]
Some of us fall by the wayside
And some of us soar to the stars
And some of us sail through our troubles
And some have to live with the scars
There's far too much to take in here
More to find than can ever be found
But the sun rollin' high through the sapphire sky
Keeps great and small on the endless round

[Chorus]
In the circle of life
It's the wheel of fortune
It's the leap of faith
It's the band of hope
Till we find our place
On the path unwinding, yeah
In the circle, the circle of life

[Outro]
It's the wheel of fortune, yeah
It's the leap of faith
It's the band of hope
Till we find our place
On the path unwinding, yeah
In the circle, the circle of life
On the path unwinding, yeah
In the circle, the circle of life[Verse 1]
Guess there are times when we all need to share a little pain
And ironin' out the rough spots
Is the hardest part when memories remain
And it's times like these when we all need to hear the radio
'Cause from the lips of some old singer
We can share the troubles we already know

[Chorus]
Turn 'em on, turn 'em on
Turn on those sad songs
When all hope is gone (ah...)
Why don't you tune in and turn them on?
They reach into your room, oh
Just feel their gentle touch (gentle touch)
When all hope is gone (ooh)
Sad songs say so much

[Verse 2]
If someone else is sufferin' enough, oh, to write it down
When every single word makes sense
Then it's easier to have those songs around
The kick inside is in the line that finally gets to you
And it feels so good to hurt so bad
And suffer just enough to sing the blues

[Chorus]
So turn 'em on, turn 'em on
Turn on those sad songs
When all hope is gone (ah...)
Why don't you tune in and turn them on?
They reach into your room, oh
Just feel their gentle touch (gentle touch)
When all hope is gone (ooh...)
You know sad songs say so much

[Bridge]
Sad songs, they say
Sad songs, they say
Sad songs, they say (ah...)
Sad songs, they say so much

[Chorus]
So turn 'em on (turn 'em on), oh, turn 'em on (turn 'em on)
Turn on those sad songs (sad songs)
When all hope is gone (ah...)
Why don't you tune in and turn them on?
They reach into your room, oh
Can feel their gentle touch (gentle touch)
When all hope is gone (ooh...)
You know sad songs say so much

[Outro]
When all hope is gone
You know sad songs say so much (ooh, la, la-la, ooh, la, la-la)
When every little bit of hope is gone
Sad songs say so much (ooh, la, la-la, ooh, la, la-la)
When every little bit of hope is gone
Sad songs say so much (ooh, la, la-la, ooh, la, la-la)
When all hope is gone
Sad songs say so much (ooh, la, la-la, ooh, la, la-la)
When every little bit of hope is gone
Sad songs say so much (ooh, la, la-la, ooh, la, la-la)
When everything you do is goin' wrong
Sad songs say so much (ooh, la, la-la, ooh, la, la-la)[Verse 1: Elton John and RuPaul]
Don't go breaking my heart
I couldn't if I tried
Honey if I get restless
Baby you're not that kind
Don't go breaking my heart
You take the weight off me
Honey when you knock on my door
I gave you my key

[Pre-Chorus: Elton John and RuPaul]
Oooh-hoo
Nobody knows it
When I was down
I was your clown
Oooh-hoo
Nobody knows it
Right from the start
I gave you my heart
I gave you my heart

[Chorus: Elton John and RuPaul]
So don't go breaking my heart
I won't go breaking your heart
Don't go breaking my heart

[Verse 2: Elton John and RuPaul]
And nobody told us
Because nobody showed us
And now it's up to us babe
Oooh, I think we can make it
So don't misunderstand me
You put the light in my life
Oh you put the sparks to the flame
I've got your heart in my sights

[Pre-Chorus: Elton John and RuPaul]
Oooh-hoo
Nobody knows it
When I was down
I was your clown
Oooh-hoo
Nobody knows it
Right from the start
I gave you my heart
I gave you my heart

[Chorus: Elton John and RuPaul]
So don't go breaking my heart
I won't go breaking your heart
Don't go breaking my heart

[Instrumental Break]

[Pre-Chorus: Elton John and RuPaul]
Oooh-hoo
Nobody knows it
When I was down
I was your clown
Right from the start
I gave you my heart
I gave you my heart
Oooh, I gave you my heart

[Chorus: Elton John and RuPaul]
So don't go breaking my heart
I won't go breaking your heart
Don't go breaking my heart
I won't go breaking your heart
Don't go breaking my heart
I won't go breaking your heart
Don't go breaking my heart
I won't go breaking your heart
Don't go breaking my heart
I won't go breaking your heartAs I awoke this evening
With the smell of woodsmoke clinging
Like a gentle cobweb hanging
Upon a painted tepee
Oh, I went to see my chieftain
With my warlance and my woman
For he told us that the yellow moon
Would very soon be leaving

This I can't believe I said
I can't believe our Warlord's dead
Oh, he would not leave the chosen ones
To the buzzards and the soldiers' guns

Oh, great father of the Iroquois
Ever since I was young
I've read the writing of the smoke
And breast-fed on the sound of drums
I've learned to hurl the tomahawk
And ride a painted pony wild
To run the gauntlet of the Sioux
To make a chieftain's daughter mine

And now you ask that I should watch
The red man's race be slowly crushed?
What kind of words are these to hear
From Yellow Dog, whom white man fears?

I take only what is mine, Lord
My pony, my squaw, and my child
I can't stay to see you die
Along with my tribe's pride
I go to search for the yellow moon
And the fathers of our sons
Where the red sun sinks in the hills of gold
And the healing waters run

Trampling down the prairie rose
Leaving hoof tracks in the sand
Those who wish to follow me
I welcome with my hands
I heard from passing renegades
Geronimo was dead
He'd been laying down his weapons
When they filled him full of lead

Now there seems no reason why
I should carry on
In this land that once was my land
I can't find a home
It's lonely and it's quiet
And the horse soldiers are coming
And I think it's time I strung my bow
And ceased my senseless running
For soon I'll find the yellow moon
Along with my loved ones
Where the buffaloes graze in clover fields
Without the sound of guns

And the red sun sinks at last
Into the hills of gold
And peace to this young warrior
Comes with a bullet hole[Verse 1]
Turn me loose from your hands
Let me fly to distant lands
Over green fields, trees and mountains
Flowers and forest fountains
Home along the lanes of the skyway

[Verse 2]
For this dark and lonely room
Projects a shadow cast in gloom
And my eyes are mirrors of the world outside
Thinking of the way that the wind can turn the tide
And these shadows turn from purple into grey

[Pre-Chorus]
For just a Skyline Pigeon
Dreaming of the open
Waiting for the day
He can spread his wings
Fly away again

[Chorus]
Fly away, skyline pigeon, fly
Towards the dreams you've left so very far behind
Fly away, skyline pigeon, fly
Towards the dreams you've left so very far behind

[Verse 3]
Just let me wake up in the morning to the smell of new mown hay
To laugh and cry, to live and die in the brightness of my day
I wanna hear the pealing bells of distant churches sing
But most of all, please free me from this aching metal ring
And open out this cage towards the sun

[Pre-Chorus]
For just a Skyline Pigeon
Dreaming of the open
Waiting for the day
He can spread his wings
And fly away again

[Chorus]
Fly away, skyline pigeon, fly
Towards the things you've left so very far behind
Fly away, skyline pigeon, fly
Towards the things you've left so very, so very far behind[Intro]
"Look, I was gonna go easy on you not to hurt your feelings."
"But I'm only going to get this one chance." (Six minutes Six minutes)
"Something's wrong, I can feel it." (Six minutes, Slim Shady, you're on!)
"Just a feeling I've got. Like something's about to happen, but I don't know what.
If that means what I think it means, we're in trouble, big trouble;
And if he is as bananas as you say, I'm not taking any chances."
"You are just what the doc ordered."

[Chorus]
I'm beginnin' to feel like a Rap God, Rap God
All my people from the front to the back nod, back nod
Now, who thinks their arms are long enough to slap box, slap box?
They said I rap like a robot, so call me Rap-bot

[Verse 1]
But for me to rap like a computer it must be in my genes
I got a laptop in my back pocket
My pen'll go off when I half-cock it
Got a fat knot from that rap profit
Made a livin' and a killin' off it
Ever since Bill Clinton was still in office
With Monica Lewinsky feelin' on his nutsack
I'm an MC still as honest
But as rude and as indecent as all hell
Syllables, skill-a-holic (Kill 'em all with)
This flippity dippity-hippity hip-hop
You don't really wanna get into a pissin' match
With this rappity brat, packin' a MAC in the back of the Ac'
Backpack rap crap, yap-yap, yackety-yack
And at the exact same time, I attempt these lyrical acrobat stunts while I'm practicin' that
I'll still be able to break a motherfuckin' table
Over the back of a couple of faggots and crack it in half
Only realized it was ironic, I was signed to Aftermath after the fact
How could I not blow? All I do is drop F-bombs
Feel my wrath of attack
Rappers are havin' a rough time period, here's a maxi pad
It's actually disastrously bad for the wack
While I'm masterfully constructing this masterpiece as

[Chorus]
'Cause I'm beginnin' to feel like a Rap God, Rap God
All my people from the front to the back nod, back nod
Now, who thinks their arms are long enough to slap box, slap box?
Let me show you maintainin' this shit ain't that hard, that hard
Everybody wants the key and the secret to rap immortality like  have got

[Verse 2]
Well, to be truthful the blueprint's
Simply rage and youthful exuberance
Everybody loves to root for a nuisance
Hit the Earth like an asteroid
Did nothing but shoot for the Moon since (Pew!)
MCs get taken to school with this music
'Cause I use it as a vehicle to "bus the rhyme"
Now I lead a new school full of students
Me? I'm a product of Rakim
Lakim Shabazz, 2Pac, N.W.A, Cube, hey Doc, Ren
Yella, Eazy, thank you, they got Slim
Inspired enough to one day grow up, blow up and be in a position
To meet RunD.M.C., induct them
Into the motherfuckin' Rock and Roll Hall of Fame
Even though I'll walk in the church and burst in a ball of flames
Only Hall of Fame I'll be inducted in is the alcohol of fame
On the wall of shame
You fags think it's all a game, 'til I walk a flock of flames
Off a plank and, tell me what in the fuck are you thinkin'?
Little gay-lookin' boy
So gay I can barely say it with a straight face, lookin' boy (Ha-ha!)
You're witnessin' a mass-occur
Like you're watching a church gathering take place, lookin' boy
"Oy vey, that boy's gay!"that's all they say, lookin' boy
You get a thumbs up, pat on the back
And a "way to go" from your label every day, lookin' boy
Hey, lookin' boy! What you say, lookin' boy?
I get a "hell yeah" from Dre, lookin' boy
I'ma work for everything I have, never asked nobody for shit
Get outta my face, lookin' boy!
Basically, boy, you're never gonna be capable
Of keepin' up with the same pace, lookin' boy, 'cause

[Chorus]
I'm beginnin' to feel like a Rap God, Rap God
All my people from the front to the back nod, back nod
The way I'm racin' around the track, call me NASCAR, NASCAR
Dale Earnhardt of the trailer park, the White Trash God
Kneel before General Zod
This planet's Kryptonno, Asgard, Asgard

[Verse 3]
So you'll be Thor, I'll be Odin
You rodent, I'm omnipotent
Let off, then I'm reloadin'
Immediately with these bombs I'm totin'
And I should not be woken
I'm the walkin' dead, but I'm just a talkin' head, a zombie floatin'
But I got your mom deep-throatin'
I'm out my Ramen Noodle
We have nothin' in common, poodle
I'm a Doberman, pinch yourself in the arm and pay homage, pupil
It's me, my honesty's brutal
But it's honestly futile if I don't utilize what I do though
For good at least once in a while
So I wanna make sure somewhere in this chicken scratch I scribble and doodle enough rhymes
To maybe try to help get some people through tough times
But I gotta keep a few punchlines
Just in case 'cause even you unsigned
Rappers are hungry lookin' at me like it's lunchtime
I know there was a time where once I
Was king of the underground
But I still rap like I'm on my Pharoahe Monch grind
So I crunch rhymes, but sometimes when you combine
Appeal with the skin color of mine
You get too big and here they come tryin'
To censor you like that one line
I said on "I'm Back" from The Mathers LP 1 when I
Tried to say I'll take seven kids from Columbine
Put 'em all in a line, add an AK-47, a revolver and a 9
See if I get away with it now that I ain't as big as I was, but I'm
Morphin' into an immortal, comin' through the portal
You're stuck in a time warp from 2004 though
And I don't know what the fuck that you rhyme for
You're pointless as Rapunzel with fuckin' cornrows
You write normal? Fuck being normal!
And I just bought a new raygun from the future
Just to come and shoot ya, like when Fabolous made Ray J mad
'Cause Fab said he looked like a fag at Mayweather's pad
Singin' to a man while he played piano
Man, oh man, that was a 24/7 special on the cable channel
So Ray J went straight to the radio station
The very next day, "Hey Fab, I'ma kill you!"
Lyrics comin' at you at supersonic speed (J.J. Fad)
Uh, summa-lumma, dooma-lumma, you assumin' I'm a human
What I gotta do to get it through to you I'm superhuman?
Innovative and I'm made of rubber so that anything you say is ricochetin' off of me and it'll glue to you and
I'm devastating, more than ever demonstrating
How to give a motherfuckin' audience a feeling like it's levitating
Never fading, and I know the haters are forever waiting
For the day that they can say I fell off, they'll be celebrating
'Cause I know the way to get 'em motivated
I make elevating music, you make elevator music
"Oh, he's too mainstream."
Well, that's what they do when they get jealous, they confuse it
"It's not hip-hop, it's pop,"'cause I found a hella way to fuse it
With rock, shock rap with Doc
Throw on "Lose Yourself" and make 'em lose it
"I don't know how to make songs like that
I don't know what words to use."
Let me know when it occurs to you
While I'm rippin' any one of these verses that versus you
It's curtains, I'm inadvertently hurtin' you
How many verses I gotta murder to
Prove that if you were half as nice, your songs you could sacrifice virgins too?!
Ugh, school flunky, pill junkie
But look at the accolades these skills brung me
Full of myself, but still hungry
I bully myself 'cause I make me do what I put my mind to
And I'm a million leagues above you
Ill when I speak in tongues, but it's still tongue-in-cheek, fuck you
I'm drunk, so, Satan, take the fucking wheel
I'ma sleep in the front seat
Bumpin' Heavy D and the Boyz, still "Chunky but Funky"
But in my head there's something I can feel tugging and struggling
Angels fight with devils and here's what they want from me
They're askin' me to eliminate some of the women hate
But if you take into consideration the bitter hatred
I have, then you may be a little patient
And more sympathetic to the situation
And understand the discrimination
But fuck it, life's handin' you lemons? Make lemonade then!
But if I can't batter the women
How the fuck am I supposed to bake them a cake then?!
Don't mistake him for Satan; it's a fatal mistake
If you think I need to be overseas and take a vacation
To trip a broad, and make her fall on her face and
Don't be a retardbe a king? Think not
Why be a king when you can be a God?[Intro]
You sound like a bitch, bitch
Shut the fuck up
When your fans become your haters
You done?
Fuckin' beard's weird
Alright
You yellin' at the mic, fuckin' weird beard (You want smoke)
We doin' this once
You yellin' at the mic, your beard's weird
Why you yell at the mic? (Illa)

[Verse]
Rihanna just hit me on a text
Last night I left hickeys on her neck
Wait, you just dissed me? I'm perplexed
Insult me in a line, compliment me on the next
Damn, I'm really sorry you want me to have a heart attack
Was watchin' 8 Mile on my NordicTrack
Realized I forgot to call you back
Here's that autograph for your daughter, I wrote it on a Starter cap
Stan, Stan, son
Listen, man, Dad isn't mad
But how you gonna name yourself after a damn gun
And have a man-bun?
The giant's woke, eyes open, undeniable
Supplyin' smoke, got the fire stoked
Say you got me in a scope, but you grazed me
I say one call to Interscope and you're Swayze
Your reply got the crowd yelling, "Woo!"
So before you die let's see who can out-petty who
With your corny lines ("Slim, you're old")ow, Kelly, ooh
But I'm 45 and I'm still outselling you
By 29, I had three albums that had blew
Now let's talk about somethin' I don't really do
Go in someone's daughter's mouth stealin' food
But you're a fuckin' mole hill
Now I'ma make a mountain out of you, woo!
Ho, chill, actin' like you put the chrome barrel to my bone marrow
Gunner? Bitch, you ain't a bow and arrow
Say you'll run up on me like a phone bill, sprayin' lead (Brrt)
Playin' dead, that's the only time you hold still (Hold up)
Are you eating cereal or oatmeal?
What the fuck's in the bowl, milk? Wheaties or Cheerios?
'Cause I'm takin' a shit in 'em, Kelly, I need reading material
Dictionary
"Yo, Slim, your last four albums sucked
Go back to Recovery," oh shoot, that was three albums ago
What do you know? Oops
Know your facts before you come at me, lil' goof
Luxury, oh, you broke, bitch? Yeah, I had enough money in '02
To burn it in front of you, ho
Younger me? No, you the wack me, it's funny but so true
I'd rather be 80-year-old me than 20-year-old you
'Til I'm hitting old age
Still can fill a whole page with a 10-year-old's rage
Got more fans than you in your own city, lil' kiddy, go play
Feel like I'm babysitting Lil Tay
Got the Diddy okay so you spent your whole day
Shootin' a video just to fuckin' dig your own grave
Got you at your own wake, I'm the billy goat
You ain't never made a list next to no Biggie, no Jay
Next to Taylor Swift and that Iggy ho, you about to really blow
Kelly, they'll be putting your name
Next to Ja, next to Benzinodie, motherfucker!
Like the last motherfucker sayin' Hailie in vain
Alien brain, you Satanist (Yeah)
My biggest flops are your greatest hits
The game's mine again and ain't nothin' changed but the locks
So before I slay this bitch I, mwah, give Jade a kiss
Gotta wake up Labor Day to this (The fuck?)
Bein' rich-shamed by some prick usin' my name for clickbait
In a state of bliss 'cause I said his goddamn name
Now I gotta cock back, aim
Yeah, bitch, pop Champagne to this! (Pop)
It's your moment
This is it, as big as you're gonna get, so enjoy it
Had to give you a career to destroy it
Lethal injection
Go to sleep six feet deep, I'll give you a B for the effort
But if I was three-foot-eleven
You'd look up to me, and for the record
You would suck a dick to fuckin' be me for a second
Lick a ballsack to get on my channel
Give your life to be as solidified
This mothafuckin' shit is like Rambo when he's out of bullets
So what good is a fuckin' machine gun when it's outta ammo?
Had enough of this tatted-up mumble rapper
How the fuck can him and I battle?
He'll have to fuck Kim in my flannel
I'll give him my sandals
'Cause he knows, long as I'm Shady he's gon' have to live in my shadow
Exhausting, letting off on my offspring
Lick a gun barrel, bitch, get off me!
You dance around it like a sombrero, we can all see
You're fuckin' salty
'Cause Young Gerald's balls-deep inside of Halsey
Your red sweater, your black leather
You dress better, I rap better
That a death threat or a love letter?
Little white toothpick
Thinks it's over a pic, I just don't like you, prick
Thanks for dissing me
Now I had an excuse on the mic to write "Not Alike"
But really I don't care who's in the right
But you're losin' the fight you picked
Who else want it? Kellsattempt fails! BuddenL's!
Fuckin' nails in these coffins as soft as Cottonelle
Killshot, I will not fail, I'm with the Doc still
But this idiot's boss pops pills and tells him he's got skills
But, Kells, the day you put out a hit's the day Diddy admits
That he put the hit out that got Pac killed, ah!
I'm sick of you bein' wack
And still usin' that mothafuckin' Auto-Tune
So let's talk about it (Let's talk about it)
I'm sick of your mumble rap mouth
Need to get the cock up out it
Before we can even talk about it (Talk about it)
I'm sick of your blonde hair and earrings
Just 'cause you look in the mirror and think
That you're Marshall Mathers (Marshall Mathers)
Don't mean you are, and you're not about it
So just leave my dick in your mouth and keep my daughter out it

[Outro]
You fuckin'oh
And I'm just playin', Diddy
You know I love you[Intro]
Look, if you had one shot or one opportunity
To seize everything you ever wanted in one moment
Would you capture it, or just let it slip? Yo

[Verse 1]
His palms are sweaty, knees weak, arms are heavy
There's vomit on his sweater already, mom's spaghetti
He's nervous, but on the surface he looks calm and ready
To drop bombs, but he keeps on forgetting
What he wrote down, the whole crowd goes so loud
He opens his mouth, but the words won't come out
He's choking, how? Everybody's joking now
The clock's run out, time's up, overblaow!
Snap back to reality, ope there goes gravity, ope
There goes Rabbit, he choked, he's so mad but he won't
Give up that easy, no, he won't have it, he knows
His whole back's to these ropes, it don't matter, he's dope
He knows that but he's broke, he's so stagnant, he knows
When he goes back to this mobile home, that's when it's
Back to the lab again yo, this old rap shit, he
Better go capture this moment and hope it don't pass him, and

[Chorus]
You better lose yourself in the music
The moment, you own it, you better never let it go (Go!)
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo
You better lose yourself in the music
The moment, you own it, you better never let it go (Go!)
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo
You better

[Verse 2]
His soul's escaping through this hole that is gaping
This world is mine for the taking, make me king
As we move toward a New World Order
A normal life is boring; but superstardom's
Close to post-mortem, it only grows harder
Homie grows hotter, he blows, it's all over
These hoes is all on him, coast-to-coast shows
He's known as the Globetrotter, lonely roads
God only knows, he's grown farther from home, he's no father
He goes home and barely knows his own daughter
But hold your nose, 'cause here goes the cold water
These hoes don't want him no mo', he's cold product
They moved on to the next schmoe who flows
He nose-dove and sold nada, and so the soap opera
Is told, it unfolds, I suppose it's old, partner
But the beat goes on: da-da-dom, da-dom, dah-dah, dah-dah

[Chorus]
You better lose yourself in the music
The moment, you own it, you better never let it go (Go!)
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo
You better lose yourself in the music
The moment, you own it, you better never let it go (Go!)
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo
You better

[Verse 3]
No more games, I'ma change what you call rage
Tear this motherfuckin' roof off like two dogs caged
I was playin' in the beginning, the mood all changed
I've been chewed up and spit out and booed off stage
But I kept rhymin' and stepped right in the next cypher
Best believe somebody's payin' the Pied Piper
All the pain inside amplified by the
Fact that I can't get by with my nine-to-
Five and I can't provide the right type of life for my family
'Cause man, these goddamn food stamps don't buy diapers
And there's no movie, there's no Mekhi Phifer, this is my life
And these times are so hard, and it's gettin' even harder
Tryna feed and water my seed, plus teeter-totter
Caught up between bein' a father and a prima donna
Baby mama drama, screamin' on her, too much for me to wanna
Stay in one spot, another day of monotony's
Gotten me to the point I'm like a snail, I've got
To formulate a plot or end up in jail or shot
Success is my only motherfuckin' optionfailure's not
Mom, I love you, but this trailer's got
To go; I cannot grow old in Salem's Lot
So here I go, it's my shot: feet, fail me not
This may be the only opportunity that I got

[Chorus]
You better lose yourself in the music
The moment, you own it, you better never let it go (Go!)
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo
You better lose yourself in the music
The moment, you own it, you better never let it go (Go!)
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo
You better

[Outro]
You can do anything you set your mind to, man[Intro: Rihanna]
I'm friends with the monster that's under my bed
Get along with the voices inside of my head
You're tryin' to save me, stop holdin' your breath
And you think I'm crazy, yeah, you think I'm crazy

[Verse 1: Eminem]
I wanted the fame but not the cover of Newsweek
Oh well, guess beggars can't be choosey
Wanted to receive attention for my music
Wanted to be left alone in public, excuse me
For wantin' my cake, and eat it too, and wantin' it both ways
Fame made me a balloon cause my ego inflated
When I blew, see, but it was confusing
Cause all I wanted to do's be the Bruce Lee of loose leaf
Abused ink, used it as a tool when I blew steam
Whoo! Hit the lottery, ooh-wee
But with what I gave up to get it was bittersweet
It was like winnin' a used mink
Ironic cause I think I'm gettin' so huge I need a shrink
I'm beginnin' to lose sleep: one sheep, two sheep
Goin' coo-coo and kooky as Kool Keith
But I'm actually weirder than you think, cause I'm

[Chorus: Rihanna & (Bebe Rexha)]
I'm friends with the monster that's under my bed
Get along with the voices inside of my head
You're tryin' to save me, stop holdin' your breath
And you think I'm crazy, yeah, you think I'm crazy
Well, that's nothin' (Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
(Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
Well, that's nothin' (Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
(Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)

[Verse 2: Eminem]
Now, I ain't much of a poet
But I know somebody once told me to seize the moment
And don't squander it cause you never know when it all
Could be over tomorrow, so I keep conjurin'
Sometimes I wonder where these thoughts spawn from
Yeah, ponderin'll do you wonders
No wonder you're losin' your mind, the way it wanders
Yodel-odel-ay-hee-hoo! I think it went wanderin' off down yonder
And stumbled onto Jeff VanVonderen
Cause I need an interventionist
To intervene between me and this monster
And save me from myself and all this conflict
Cause the very thing that I love's killin' me and I can't conquer it
My OCD's conkin' me in the head, keep knockin'
Nobody's home, I'm sleepwalkin'
I'm just relayin' what the voice in my head's sayin'
Don't shoot the messenger, I'm just friends with the

[Chorus: Rihanna & (Bebe Rexha)]
I'm friends with the monster that's under my bed
Get along with the voices inside of my head
You're tryin' to save me, stop holdin' your breath
And you think I'm crazy, yeah, you think I'm crazy
Well, that's nothin' (Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
(Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
Well, that's nothin' (Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
(Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)

[Verse 3: Eminem]
Call me crazy, but I have this vision, one day that
I'll walk amongst you a regular civilian
But until then, drums get killed and
I'm comin' straight at MC's, blood gets spilled and
I'll take you back to the days that I'd get on a Dre track
Give every kid who got played that pumped-up feelin'
And shit to say back to the kids who played him
I ain't here to save the fuckin' children
But if one kid out of a hundred million
Who are goin' through a struggle, feels it and relates, that's great!
It's payback, Russell Wilson fallin' way back
In the draft, turn nothin' into somethin', still can make that
Straw into gold, chump, I will spinRumpelstiltskin in a haystack
Maybe I need a straightjacket
Face facts: I am nuts for real, but I'm okay with that!
It's nothin', I'm still friends with the

[Chorus: Rihanna]
I'm friends with the monster that's under my bed
Get along with the voices inside of my head
You're tryin' to save me, stop holdin' your breath
And you think I'm crazy, yeah, you think I'm crazy

[Bridge: Rihanna & (Eminem)]
I'm friends with the monster that's under my bed
(Get along with) Get along with the voices inside of my head
(You're tryin' to) You're tryin' to save me, stop holdin' your breath
(And you think) And you think I'm crazy, yeah, you think I'm crazy
Well, that's nothin'

[Outro: Rihanna & (Bebe Rexha)]
(Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
(Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
Well, that's nothin' (Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
(Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)[Intro]
Ugh, you're a monster

[Verse 1: Eminem]
I can swallow a bottle of alcohol and I'll feel like Godzilla
Betterhitthe deck likethe card dealer
My whole squad's inhere, walking around the party
A cross between a zombie apocalypse and B-Bobby "The
Brain" Heenan which is probably the
Same reason I wrestle with mania
Shady's in this bitch, I'm posse'd up
Consider it to cross me a costly mistake
If they sleepin' on me, the hoes better get insomnia
ADHD, Hydroxycut
Pass the Courvoisier (Hey, hey)
In AA with an AK, melee, finna set it like a playdate
Better vacate, retreat like a vacay, mayday (Ayy)
This beat is cray-cray, Ray J, H-A-H-A-H-A
Laughing all the way to the bank, I spray flames
They cannot tame or placate the

[Chorus: Juice WRLD with Eminem]
Monster
You get in my way, I'ma feed you to the monster (Yeah)
I'm normal during the day, but at night, turn to a monster (Yeah)
When the moon shines like Ice Road Truckers
I look like a villain outta those blockbusters
Godzilla, fire spitter, monster
Blood on the dance floor, and Louis V carpet
Fire, Godzilla, fire, monster
Blood on the dance floor, and Louis V carpet

[Verse 2: Eminem]
I'm just a product of Slick Rick and Onyx, told 'em lick the balls
Had 'em just appalled, did so many things that pissed 'em off
It's impossible to list 'em all
And in the midst of all this
I'm in a mental hospital with a crystal ball
Tryna see, will I still be like this tomorrow?
Risperdal, voices whisper
My fist is balled back up against the wall, pencil drawn
This is just the song to go ballistic on
You just pulled a pistol on a guy with a missile launcher
I'm just a Loch Ness, the mythological
Quick to tell a bitch screw off like a fifth of vodka
When you twist the top of the bottle, I'm a

[Chorus: Juice WRLD with Eminem]
Monster
You get in my way, I'ma feed you to the monster (Yeah)
I'm normal during the day, but at night, turn to a monster (Yeah)
When the moon shines like Ice Road Truckers
I look like a villain outta those blockbusters
Godzilla, fire spitter, monster
Blood on the dance floor, and Louis V carpet
Fire, Godzilla, fire, monster
Blood on the dance floor, and Louis V carpet

[Verse 3: Eminem]
If you never gave a damn (Ayy), raise your hand
'Cause I'm about to set trip, vacation plans
I'm on point like my index is, so all you will ever get is
The motherfuckin' finger (Finger), prostate exam ('Xam)
How can I have all these fans and perspire?
Like a liar's pants, I'm on fire
And I got no plans to retire and I'm still the man you admire
These chicks are spazzin' out, I only get more handsome and flyer
I got 'em passin' out like what you do when you hand someone flyers
And what goes around comes around just like the blades on the chainsaw
'Cause I caught the flack, but my dollars stacked right off the bat like a baseball
Like Kid Ink, bitch, I got them racks with so much ease that they call me Diddy
'Cause I make bands and I call getting cheese a cakewalk (Cheesecake, yeah)
Bitch, I'm a player, I'm too motherfuckin' stingy for Cher
Won't even lend you an ear, ain't even pretending to care
But I tell a bitch I'll marry her if she'll bury her
Face in my genital area, the original Richard Ramirez
Cristhian Rivera, 'cause my lyrics never sit well
So they wanna give me the chair
Like a paraplegic, and it's scary, call it Hari Kari
'Cause e'ry Tom and Dick and Harry carry a Merriam motherfuckin' dictionary on 'em
Swearing up and down they can spit, this shit's hilarious
It's time to put these bitches in the obituary column
We wouldn't see eye to eye with a staring problem
Get the shaft like a steering column (Monster)
Trigger happy, pack heat, but it's black ink
Evil half of the Bad Meets
Evil, that means take a back seat
Take it back to Fat Beats with a maxi single
Look at my rap sheet, what attracts these people
Is my 'Gangsta Bitch' like Apache with a catchy jingle
I stack chips, you barely got a half-eaten Cheeto
Fill 'em with the venom and eliminate 'em
Other words, I Minute Maid 'em
I don't wanna hurt 'em, but I did, I'm in a fit of rage
I'm murderin' again, nobody will evade
I'm fittin' to kill 'em and dumpin' their fuckin' bodies in the lake
Obliterating everything, incinerate a renegade
I'm here to make anybody who want it with the pen afraid
But don't nobody want it, but they're gonna get it anyway
'Cause I'm beginnin' to feel like I'm mentally ill
I'm Attila, kill or be killed, I'm a killer bee, the vanilla gorilla
You're bringin' the killer within me outta me
You don't wanna be the enemy of the demon who entered me
Or be on the receivin' end of me, what stupidity it'd be
Every bit of me's the epitome of a spitter
When I'm in the vicinity, motherfucker, you better duck
Or you finna be dead the minute you run into me
A hundred percent of you is a fifth of a percent of me
I'm 'bout to fuckin' finish you, bitch, I'm unfadable
You wanna battle, I'm available, I'm blown up like an inflatable
I'm undebatable, I'm unavoidable, I'm unevadable
I'm on the toilet bowl, I got a trailer full of money and I'm paid in full
I'm not afraid to pull a

[Outro: Eminem]
Man, stop
Look what I'm plannin', haha[Intro: Joyner Lucas]
Woah, Joyner, Joyner, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Pre-Chorus: Joyner Lucas]
Yeah, I done did a lot of things in my day, I admit it
I don't take back what I say, if I said it then I meant it
All my life I want a Grammy, but I'll prolly never get it
I ain't never had no trophy or no motherfuckin' ribbon (Yah I said it)
Fuck the system, I'm that nigga, bend the law, cut the rules
I'm about to risk it all, I ain't got too much to lose
Y'all been eatin' long enough, it's my turn to cut the food
Pass the plate! Where my drink? This my day, lucky you
Fuck you too, woo!

[Chorus: Joyner Lucas]
Y'all gotta move, y'all gotta move, y'all gotta move
Give me some room, give me some room, give me the juice
Hop out the coupe, hop out the coupe, hop out and shoot
Y'all gotta move, y'all gotta move, give me the juice

[Verse 1: Joyner Lucas]
Back on my bullshit, my back to the wall
Turn my back on you, all of you finished
Back to these bullets, it's back to the job
Pull my MAC out and all of you runnin'
Back on my hood shit, it's back to the pushin'
These packs and I'm actually pumpin'
Can't fuck with you rappers, you practically suckin'
You mighta went platinum but that don't mean nothin'
I'm actually buzzin' this time
Straight out the kitchen, I told 'em the oven is mine
I do not fuck with you guys
If I don't kill you, just know you gon' suffer this time
I ain't no gangster but I got some bangers
Some chains and some blades and a couple of knives
Choppers and jammies, a partridge, a pear tree
My 12 days of Christmas was nothin' but lies (I)
Run at you hard like a sumo (Sumo)
They say I talk like a chulo (Chulo)
I live in Mars, I'm not Bruno (Woo)
Bitch I'm a dog, call me Cujo (Rah)
You play your cards, I reverse on you all
And I might just draw 4 like a Uno (Bup)
Cllate boca mejor, maricn, little puto, and all of you culo (Joyner)
They've invented a level up in the ghetto to get old
Lookin' for somethin' I prolly can never find now
Shit get relevant 'til 'nother beef die down
In truth, a nigga just really want me tied down
I've been alone and I never needed nobody
Just only me and my shotty, I'll tell these niggas to lie down
Keep all the money, I never wanted the lifestyle
I just pray to God that my son'll be alright now
I said ain't no love for the other side
Or anyone who ever want smoke (Joyner)
When I die I'm goin' out as the underdog who never lost hope (Yeah)
You in the wrong cab down the wrong path
Nigga, wrong way, wrong road (Woo, woo)
Snakes in the grass tryna slither fast
I just bought a fuckin' lawn mower (Vroom!)

[Pre-Verse: Eminem]
I done said a lotta things in my day, I admit it
This is payback in a way, I regret it that I did it
I done won a couple Grammys, but I sold my soul to get 'em
Wasn't in it for the trophies, just the fuckin' recognition
Fuck's the difference?
I'm that cracker, bend the law, fuck the rules
Man, I used to risk it all, now I got too much to lose
I've been eatin' long enough, man, my stomach should be full
I just ate, licked the plate, my buffet, lucky me
Fuck you think? (Woo!)

[Verse 2: Eminem]
I got a couple of mansions
Still I don't have any manners
You got a couple of ghost writers
But to these kids it don't actually matter
They're askin' me, "What the fuck happened to hip-hop?"
I said, "I don't have any answers."
'Cause I took an L when I dropped my last album
It hurt me like hell but I'm back on these rappers
And actually comin' from humble beginnings
I'm somewhat uncomfortable winning
I wish I could say, "What a wonderful feeling!"
"We're on the upswing like we're punchin' the ceiling!"
But nothin' is feeling like anyone has any fuckin' ability
To even stick to a subject, it's killin' me
The inability to pen humility
Ha-ta-ta ba-ta-ta, why don't we make a bunch of
Fuckin' songs about nothin' and mumble 'em?
Fuck it, I'm goin' for the jugular
Shit is a circus, you clowns that are comin' up
Don't give an ounce of a motherfuck
About the ones that were here before you that made rap
Let's recap, way back, MC's that wreak havoc on tape decks
ADAT's, where the G Raps and Kanes at?
We need 3 Stacks ASAP and bring Masta Ace back
'Cause half of these rappers have brain damage
All the lean rappin', face tats, syruped out like tree sap
I don't hate trap, and I don't wanna seem mad
But in fact, where the old me at? The same cat
That would take that feedback and aim back, I need that
But I think it's inevitable
They know what button to press or what lever to pull
To get me to snap though (Lil' bitch)
And if I pay it attention I'm prob'ly makin' it bigger
But you've been takin' ya digs in the fuckin' back, ho (Get it?)
On the brink, any minute got me thinkin' of finishin'
Everything with acetaminophen and reapin' the benefits
I'm asleep at the wheel again
As I peak into thinkin' about an evil intent
Of another beat I'ma kill again
'Cause even if I gotta end up eatin' a pill again
Even ketamine or methamphetamine with the minithin
It better be at least 70 or 300 milligram
And I might as well 'cause I'ma end up bein' a villain again
Levels to this shit, I got an elevator
You could never say to me I'm not a fuckin' record breaker
I sound like a broken record every time I break a record
Nobody could ever take away the legacy I made, I never cater
Motherfucker, now I got a right to be this way
I got spite inside my DNA
But I wrote 'til the wheels fall off, I'm workin' tirelessly, ayy
It's the moment y'all been waitin' for
Like California wishin' rain to pour
In that drought, y'all been prayin' for
My downfall from the 8 Mile to the Southpaw
Still the same Marshall, that outlaw
That they say as a writer might've fell off
I'm back on that bull like the cowboy

[Chorus: Joyner Lucas & Eminem]
So y'all gotta move (Yeah), y'all gotta move (Yeah), y'all gotta move
Give me some room, give me some room, give me the juice
Hop out the coupe, hop out the coupe, hop out and shoot
Y'all gotta move, y'all gotta move, give me the juice[Intro]
*Plane crash*
Yeah (Illa, Illa, Illa)
Yo, I'm just gonna write down my first thoughts, and see where this takes me, cause I feel like I wanna punch the world in the fuckin' face right now
Yeah

[Verse]
Let me explain just how to make greatness
Straight out the gate, I'm bout to break it down
Ain't no mistakes allowed, but make no mistake, I'm 'bout
To rape the alphabet, I may raise some brows
If I press the issue just to get the anger out (Brrr!)
Full magazine could take Staples out
Savage but ain't thinkin' 'bout no bank account
But bitch, I'm off the chain like Kala Brown
Motherfucker, shut the fuck up when Im talkin, lil' bitch
Im sorry, wait, what's your talent? Oh, critiquin'
My talent? Oh, bitch, I don't know who the fuck yall are
To give a sub-par bar or even have an opinion or view
You mention me, millions of views, attention in news
I mention you, lose-lose for me, win-win for you
Billions of views, your ten cents are two
Skim through the music to give shit reviews
To get clicks, but bitch, you just lit the fuse
Don't get misconstrued, business as us'
Shit-list renewed, so get shit to do
Or get dissed 'cause I just don't get
What the fuck half the shit is that you're listenin' to
Do you have any idea how much I hate this choppy flow
Everyone copies though? Prob'ly no
Get this fuckin' audio out my Audi, yo, adis
I can see why people like Lil Yachty, but not me though
Not even dissin', it just ain't for me
All I am simply is just an emcee
Maybe "Stan" just isn't your cup of tea (Get it?)
Maybe your cup's full of syrup and lean
Maybe I need to stir up shit, preferably
Shake the world up if it were up to me
Paul wants me to chill, y'all want me to ill
I should eat a pill, probably I will
Old me killed the new me, watch him bleed to death
I breathe on the mirror, I don't see my breath
Possibly I'm dead, I must be possessed
Like an evil spell, I'm E-V-I-L ("Evil" spelled)
Jam a Crest Whitestrip in the tip of my dick
With an ice pick, stick it in a vise grip
Hang it on a spike fence, bang it with a pipe wrench
While I take my ball sack and flick it like a light switch
Like Vice President Mike Pence
Back up on my shit in a sidekick as I lay it on a spike strip
These are things that I'd rather do than hear you on a mic
Since nine tenths of your rhyme is about ice and
Jesus Christ, man, how many times is
Someone gonna fuck on my bitch? (Fuck my side chick!)
You won't ever see Em icy
But as cold as I get on the M-I-C
I polarize shit, so the Thames might freeze
And your skull might split like I bashed you upside it
Bitch, I got the club on smash like a nightstick (Yeah)
Turn down for what?
I ain't loud enough, nah, turn the Valium up (Illa, Illa, Illa)
'Cause I don't know how I'm gonna get your mouths to shut
Now when it doesn't matter what caliber
I spit at, I'll bet a hundred thousand bucks
You'll turn around and just be like, "Man, how the fuck
Sourpuss gonna get mad just 'cause his album sucks?
And now he wants to take it out on us" (Ooouuu)
But last week, an ex-fan mailed me a copy
Of The Mathers LP to tell me to study
It'll help me get back to myself and she'll love me (Ooouuu)
I mailed the bitch back and said if I did that
I'd just be like everyone else in the fucking industry
Especially an effing Recovery clone of me (NFing)
So finger-bang, chicken wang, MGK, Igg' Azae'
Lil Pump, Lil Xan imitate Lil Wayne
I should aim at everybody in the game, pick a name
I'm fed up with bein' humble
And rumor is I'm hungry, I'm sure you heard rumblings
I heard you wanna rumble like an empty stomach
I heard your mumblin' but it's jumbled in mumbo-jumbo
The era that I'm from will pummel you, that's what it's comin' to
What the fuck you're gonna do when you run into it?
I'm gonna crumble you and I'll take a number two
And dump on you, if you ain't Joyner
If you ain't Kendrick or Cole or Sean, then you're a goner
I'm 'bout to bring it to anyone in this bitch who want it
I guess when you walk into BK you expect a Whopper
You can order a Quarter Pounder when you go to McDonald's
But if you're lookin' to get a porterhouse you better go get Revival
But y'all are actin' like I tried to serve you up a slider
Maybe the vocals shoulda been auto-tuned
And you woulda bought it
But sayin' I no longer got it
'Cause you missed a line and never caught it
'Cause it went over your head, because you're too stupid to get it
'Cause you're mentally retarded, but pretend to be the smartest
With your expertise and knowledge, but you'll never be an artist
And I'm harder on myself than you could ever be regardless
What I'll never be is flawless, all I'll ever be is honest (Illa, Illa, Illa)
Even when I'm gone they're gonna say I brought it
Even when I hit my forties like a fuckin' alcoholic
With a bottle full of malt liquor
But I couldn't bottle this shit any longer
The fact that I know that I'ma hit my bottom
If I don't pull myself from the jaws of defeat and rise to my feet
I don't see why y'all even started with me
I get in beefs, my enemies die
I don't cease fire 'til at least all are deceased
I'm east side, never be caught slippin'
Now you see why I don't sleep, not even a wink, I don't blink
I don't doze off, I don't even nod to the beats
I don't even close my fuckin' eyes when I sneeze
"Aw, man! That BET cypher was weak, it was garbage
The Thing ain't even orangeoh my God, that's a reach!"
Shout to all my colorblind people
Each and everyone of y'all, if you call a fire engine green
Aquamarine, or you think water is pink
"Dawg, that's a date."  "Looks like an olive to me."
"Look, there's an apple!"  "No, it's not, it's a peach!"
So finger-bang, Pootie Tang
Burger King, Gucci Gang, dookie, dang
Charlamagne gonna hate anyway, doesn't matter what I say
Give me Donkey of the Day
What a way for 2018 to get underway
But I'm gonna say everything that I wanna say
Welcome to the slaughterhouse, bitch! (Yeah)
Invite 'em in like a One A Day
I'm not done (Preach!)
'Cause I feel like the beast of burden
That line in the sand, was it even worth it?
'Cause the way I see people turning's
Makin' it seem worthless, it's startin' to defeat the purpose
I'm watchin' my fan base shrink to thirds
And I was just tryin' to do the right thing, but word
Has the court of public opinion reached a verdict
Or still yet to be determined?
'Cause I'm determined to be me, critiqued or worshipped
But if I could go back, I'd at least reword it
And say I empathize with the people this evil serpent
Sold the dream to that he's deserted
But I think it's workin'
These verses are makin' him a wee bit nervous
And he's too scurred to answer me with words
'Cause he knows that he will lyrically get murdered
But I know at least he's heard it
'Cause Agent Orange just sent the Secret Service
To meet in person to see if I really think of hurtin' him
Or ask if I'm linked to terrorists
I said, "Only when it comes to ink and lyricists."
But my beef is more media journalists
(Hold up, hold up, hold up)
I said, my beef is more meaty, a journalist
Can get a mouthful of flesh
And yes, I mean eating a penis
'Cause they've been pannin' my album to death
So I've been givin' the media fingers
Don't wanna turn this to a counseling sesh
But they've been puttin' me through the ringer
So I ain't ironin' shit out with the press
But I just took this beat to the cleaners[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
I've been a liar, been a thief
Been a lover, been a cheat
All my sins need holy water, feel it washing over me
Well, little one, I don't want to admit to something
If all it's gonna cause is pain
Truth and my lies right now are falling like the rain
So let the river run

[Verse 1: Eminem]
He's comin' home with his neck scratched, to catch flack
Sweat jackets and dress slacks, mismatched
On his breath's Jack, he's a sex addict
And she just wants to exact revenge and get back
It's a chess match, she's on his back like a jet-pack
She's kept track of all his Internet chats
And guess who just happens to be movin' on to the next
Actually, just shit on my last chick and she has what my ex lacks
'Cause she loves danger, psychopath
And you don't fuck with no man's girl, even I know that
But she's devised some plan to stab him in the back
Knife in hand, says their relationship's hangin' by a strand
So she's been on the web lately
Says maybe she'll be my Gwen Stacy, to spite her man
And I know she's using me to try to play him, I don't care
Hi Suzanne, but I shoulda said "Bye Suzanne"
After the first night, but tonight I am

[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
I've been a liar, been a thief
Been a lover, been a cheat
All my sins need holy water, feel it washing over me
Well, little one, I don't want to admit to something
If all it's gonna cause is pain
The truth and my lies now are falling like the rain
So let the river run

[Verse 2: Eminem]
A one-night stand turned a two-night stand
It was "come sunlight, scram," now we hug tight, and...
He found out, now she feels deserted and used
'Cause he left, so what? He did it first to her too
Now how am I supposed to tell this girl that we're through?
It's hard to find the words, I'm aloof, nervous, and Sue
Don't want this to hurt, but what you deserve is the truth
Don't take it personal, I just can't say this in person to you
So I revert to the studio, like hole-in-the-wall diners
Don't have to be reserved in a booth
I just feel like the person who I'm turning into's
Irreversible, I preyed on you like it's church at the pew
And now that I got you I don't want you
Took advantage in my thirst to pursue
Why do I do this dirt that I do?
Get on my soapbox and preach, my sermon and speech
Detergent and bleach is burnin' the wound
'Cause now with her in the womb
We can't bring her in this world, shoulda knew
To use protection 'fore I bit into your forbidden fruit
Fuck!

[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
I've been a liar, been a thief
Been a lover, been a cheat
All my sins need holy water, feel it washing over me
Well, little one, I don't want to admit to something
If all it's gonna cause is pain
The truth and my lies now are falling like the rain
So let the river run

[Bridge: Eminem & Ed Sheeran]
My name's (ooh), my name's (ooh)
River (ooh), river run
Call me (ooh), call me (ooh)
River (ooh), we'll let the river run

[Verse 3: Eminem]
Always the bridesmaid, never "The bride, hey!"
Fuck can I say? If life was a highway
And deceit was an enclave, I'd be swerving in five lanes
Speeds at a high rate, like I'm slidin' on ice, maybe
That's why I may have came at you sideways
I can't keep my lies straight
But I made you terminate my baby
This love triangle left us in a wreck, tangled
What else can I say? It was fun for a while
Bet I really woulda loved your smile
Didn't really wanna abort, but fuck it
What's one more lie, to tell our unborn child?

[Chorus: Ed Sheeran & Eminem]
I've been a liar, been a thief
Been a lover, been a cheat
All my sins need holy water, feel it washing over me
Well, little one (I'm sorry)
I don't want to admit to something (I fucked up)
If all it's gonna cause is pain
The truth and my lies now are falling like the rain
So let the river run[Intro]
I got a song filled with shit for the strong-willed
When the world gives you a raw deal
Sets you off 'til you scream, "Piss off! Screw you!"
When it talks to you like you don't belong
Or tells you you're in the wrong field
When something's in your mitochondrial
'Cause it latched on to you, like

[Verse 1]
Knock knock, let the devil in
Manevolent as I've ever been, head is spinnin'
This medicine's screamin', "L-L-L-Let us in!"
L-L-L-Like a salad bowl, Edgar Allan Poe
Bedridden, shoulda been dead a long time ago
Liquid Tylenol, gelatins, think my skeleton's meltin'
Wicked, I get all high when I think I've smelled the scent
Of elephant manurehell, I meant Kahla
Screw it, to hell with it, I went through hell with accelerants
And blew up my-my-myself again
Volkswagen, tailspin, bucket matches my pale skin
Mayo and went from Hellmann's and being rail thin
Filet-o-Fish, Scribble Jam, Rap Olympics '97 Freaknik
How can I be down? Me and Bizarre in Florida
Proof's room slept on the floor of 'da motel then
Dr. Dre said, "Hell yeah!"
And I got his stamp like a postcard, word to Mel-Man
And I know they're gonna hate
But I don't care, I barely can wait
To hit 'em with the snare and the bass
Square in the face, this fuckin' world better prepare to get laced
Because they're gonna taste my

[Chorus]
Venom, (I got that) adrenaline momentum
And I'm not knowin' when I'm
Ever gonna slow up and I'm
Ready to snap any moment I'm
Thinkin' it's time to go get 'em
They ain't gonna know what hit 'em
(W-W-When they get bit with the)
Venom, (I got that) adrenaline momentum
And I'm not knowin' when I'm
Ever gonna slow up and I'm
Ready to snap any moment I'm
Thinkin' it's time to go get 'em
They ain't gonna know what hit 'em
(W-W-When they get bit with the)

[Verse 2]
I said knock knock, let the devil in
Shotgun p-p-pellets in the felt pen
Cocked, fuck around and catch a hot one
It-it's evident I'm not done
V-Venomous, the thoughts spun
Like a web and you just caught in 'em
Held against your will like a hubcap or mud flap
Beat strangler attack
So this ain't gonna feel like a love tap
Eat painkiller pills, fuck up the track
Like, what's her name's at the wheel? Danica Patrick
Threw the car into reverse at the Indy, a nut crashin'
Into ya, the back of it just mangled steel
My Mustang and the Jeep Wrangler grill
With the front smashed, much as my rear fender, assassin
Slim be a combination of an actual kamikaze and Gandhi (Gandhi)
Translation, I will probably kill us both
When I end up backin' into ya
You ain't gonna be able to tell what the fuck's happenin' to ya
When you're bit with the

[Chorus]
Venom, adrenaline momentum
And I'm not knowin' when I'm
Ever gonna slow up and I'm
Ready to snap any moment I'm
Thinkin' it's time to go get 'em
They ain't gonna know what hit 'em
(W-W-When they get bit with the)
Venom, (I got that) adrenaline momentum
And I'm not knowin' when I'm
Ever gonna slow up and I'm
Ready to snap any moment I'm
Thinkin' it's time to go get 'em
They ain't gonna know what hit 'em
(W-W-When they get bit with the)

[Verse 3]
I said knock knock, let the devil in
Alien, E-E-Elliott phone home
Ain't no telling when this chokehold
On this game will end, I'm loco
Became a Symbiote, so
My fangs are in your throat, ho
You're snake-bitten with myvenom
With the ballpoint pen I'm
Gun cocked, bump stock, double-aught, buckshot
Tire thumper, a garrote, tie a couple knots
Fired up and caught fire, juggernaut
Punk rock, bitch, it's goin' down like Yung Joc
'Cause the Doc put me on like sunblock
Why the fuck not, you only get one shot
Ate shit 'til I can't taste it
Chased it with straight liquor
Then paint thinner, then drank 'til I faint
And awake with a headache
And I take anything in rectangular shape
Then I wait to face the demons I'm bonded to
'Cause they're chasin' me but I'm part of you
So escapin' me is impossible
I latch onto you like aparasite
And I probably ruined your parents' life
And your childhood too
'Cause if I'm the music that y'all grew up on
I'm responsible for you retarded fools
I'm the super villain Dad and Mom was losin' their marbles to
You marvel that? Eddie Brock is you
And I'm the suit, so call me

[Chorus]
Venom, (I got that) adrenaline momentum
And I'm not knowin' when I'm
Ever gonna slow up and I'm
Ready to snap any moment I'm
Thinkin' it's time to go get 'em
They ain't gonna know what hit 'em
(W-W-When they get bit with the)
Venom, (I got that) adrenaline momentum
And I'm not knowin' when I'm
Ever gonna slow up and I'm
Ready to snap any moment I'm
Thinkin' it's time to go get 'em
They ain't gonna know what hit 'em
(W-W-When they get bit with the)[Verse 1: Eminem]
Now this shit's about to kick off, this party looks wack
Let's take it back to straight hip-hop and start it from scratch
I'm 'bout to bloody this track up, everybody get back
That's why my pen needs a pad, 'cause my rhymes on the rag
Just like I did with addiction, I'm 'bout to kick it
Like a magician, critics I turn to crickets
Got 'em still on the fence whether to picket
But quick to get it impaled when I tell 'em, "Stick it!"
So sick, I'm looking palewait, that's my pigment
'Bout to go ham, ya bish, shout out to Kendrick
Let's bring it back to that vintage Slim, bitch!
The art of MCing mixed with da Vinci and MC Ren
And I don't mean Stimpy's friend, bitch
Been Public Enemy since you thought PE was gym, bitch

[Pre-Chorus: Eminem]
Kick your shoes off, let your hair down
(And go berserk) All night long
Grow your beard out, just weird out
(And go berserk) All night long

[Chorus 1: Eminem & Billy Squier]
We're gonna rock this house until we knock it down
So turn the volume loud
'Cause it's mayhem 'til the A.M.
So, baby, make just like K-Fed
And let yourself go, let yourself go
Say, "Fuck it!" before we kick the bucket
Life's too short to not go for broke
So everybody, everybody (Go berserk)
Grab your vial, yeah

[Verse 2: Eminem]
Guess it's just the way that I'm dressed, ain't it?
Khakis pressed, Nike shoes crispy and fresh laced
So I guess it ain't that aftershave
Or cologne that made 'em just faint
Plus I showed up with a coat fresher than wet paint
So if love is a chess game, check mate
But girl, your body's bangin', jump me in, dang, bang-bang
Yes siree 'Bob', I was thinking the same thang
So come get on this Kid's rock, baw with da baw, dang-dang
Pow-p-p-p-pow, chica, pow, chica, wow-wow
Got your gal blowin' up a valve, v-v-valve-valve
Ain't slowin' it down, throw in the towel, t-t-towel-towel
Dumb it down, I don't know how, huh-huh, how-how
At least I know that I don't know
Question is, are you bozos smart enough to feel stupid?
Hope so, now ho

[Pre-Chorus: Eminem]
Kick your shoes off, let your hair down
(And go berserk) All night long
Grow your beard out, just weird out
(And go berserk) All night long

[Chorus 2: Eminem & Billy Squier]
We're gonna rock this house until we knock it down
So turn the volume loud
'Cause it's mayhem 'til the A.M.
So crank the bass up like crazy
And let yourself go, let yourself go
Say, "Fuck it!" before we kick the bucket
Life's too short to not go for broke
So everybody, everybody (Go berzerk)
Get your vinyls

[Scratch]

[Verse 3: Eminem]
And they say that love is powerful as cough syrup in styrofoam
All I know is I fell asleep and woke up in that Monte Carlo
With the ugly Kardashian, Lamar, oh
Sorry, yowe done both set the bar low
Far as hard drugs are though, that's the past
But I done did enough codeine to knock Future into tomorrow
And girl, I ain't got no money to borrow
But I am tryin' to find a way to get you alone: car note
Oh, Marshall Mathers
Shithead with a potty mouth, get the bar of soap lathered
Kangol's and Carheartless Cargos
Girl, you're fixin' to get your heart broke
Don't be absurd, ma'am, you birdbrain, baby
I ain't called anybody baby since Birdman, unless you're a swallow (Ha-ha!)
Word, Rick? Word, man, you heard
But don't get discouraged, girl
This is your jam, unless you got toe jam

[Pre-Chorus: Eminem]
Kick your shoes off, let your hair down
(And go berserk) All night long
Grow your beard out, just weird out
(And go berserk) All night long

[Chorus 1: Eminem & Billy Squier]
We're gonna rock this house until we knock it down
So turn the volume loud
'Cause it's mayhem 'til the A.M.
So, baby, make just like K-Fed
And let yourself go, let yourself go
Say, "Fuck it!" before we kick the bucket
Life's too short to not go for broke
So everybody, everybody (Go berserk)
Grab your vial, yeah

[Chorus 2: Eminem & Billy Squier]
We're gonna rock this house until we knock it down
So turn the volume loud
'Cause it's mayhem 'til the A.M.
So crank the bass up like crazy
And let yourself go, let yourself go
Say, "Fuck it!" before we kick the bucket
Life's too short to not go for broke
So everybody, everybody (Go berzerk)

That's how much we have in common (Yah!)
That's how much we have in common (Whoa!)
Up on this mic when we're on it (Yah)
That's how much we have in common (Yuh!)
That's how much we have in common (Woo!)
That's how much we have in common
We are not alike, there's nada like us on the mic (Yah!)

[Verse 1: Royce da 5'9"]
I don't do Jordans and Audemars
I do explosions and Molotovs
Y'all blowin' smoke as if y'all ain't washed
I blow the smoke from the car exhaust
Flyin' to a party I am not invited to, feelin' like the streets need me
I ain't gotta dance long as my Ferrari Spider move like C Breezy
I don't gotta hire goons
I'd rather try to buy the moon and breathe freely
The sky is blue, the tires new
The Maserati white and cool like G-Eazy
Why these dudes tryna figure out
How to do a freestyle as fly as me? (Why?)
I'm confused tryna figure out how to do Kapri Styles and Mya G
Everybody doin' chick joints
Probably rob these little dudes at fist point
'Member everybody used to bite Nickel
Now everybody doin' Bitcoin
We don't got nothin' in common (No!)
We don't got nothin' in common (No!)
Y'all into stuff like doubled-up Styrofoam cups
On them uppers-and-downers (Woo!)
I'm into stuff like doublin' commas
Find me a brother who's solid
To count the shit up and then bust the shit down
When the cops hit us up, we can flush the shit down
We cannot give a fuck, shit, a fuckin' colonic
Sellin' your cock and your butt for a follower
Possible couple of dollars, you powder sniff
Now you slippin', call it a power trip, a product of politics
Y'all went from profit and toppin' the charts
To dropped in the park in a pile of shit
Knowledge is power, but powerless
If you've got it and you do not acknowledge it
Y'all music sound like Dr. Seuss inspired it
Hirin' strippers, prostitutes retirin'
We can spit it for your advance
I'm fit to be king, you're cut out to fit in Prince pants
You niggas

[Verse 2: Eminem]
You say you're affiliated with murderers, killers (Ayy!)
The people you run with are thuggin' (Gang!)
But you just a wannabe gunner (Gang!)
Like you was gonna do somethin'
Actin' like you catchin' bodies (Ayy!)
And you got juice, lil' youngin', you buggin'
You ain't never even been charged in connection with battery
Bitch, you ain't plugged into nothin'
Rap God spit lyrical bullets (Pew!)
And gats cock, your partners better tool up
This has not to do with muscular
But have guns for sure, you better put a
Strap on, other words if you're gonna
Roll up with your (Gang!) you're gon' need a arsenal
'Cause this bar is over your head
So you better{gun cock}have arms if you're gonna pull up (Skrrt!)
Oh, you run the streets, huh?
Now you wanna come and fuck with me, huh?
This little cock-sucker, he must be feelin' himself
He wants to keep up his tough demeanour
So he does a feature, decides to team up with N9na
But next time you don't gotta use Tech N9ne
If you wanna come at me with a sub, Machine Gun
And I'm talkin' to you
But you already know who the fuck you are, Kelly
I don't use sublims and sure as fuck don't sneak-diss
But keep commenting on my daughter Hailie
I keep on telling motherfuckers
But just in case you forgot really and need Ja memories jarred like strawberry or pineapple apricot jelly
I respond rarely, but this time Shady 'bout to sound off
Like a fuckin' cocked semi-Glock demi-god
Let me put a fuckin' silencer on this little
Non-threatening blond fairy cornball takin' shots at me
You're not ready, fool, break yourself like Rock Steady Crew
Obviously, I'm not getting through
We can get it poppin' like Redenbach, letting off like Remy Ma
Heavy artillery, Godzilla harsh with a hard shell
With a motherfucking heart bigger than Bizarre's belly
Only time you'll ever say I lost
You'll be talkin' 'bout Fetty Wap, better call Diddy
Just to try to get me off
And you better hope I don't call Trick Trick
Bitch, this shit don't fly in our city
Punk, you don't disrespect OGs, R.I.P. Prodigy
Sold Dre my soul and then told him the moment he signed me
That I'll be the most hated, though made it
So that there's no shame, it's okay to own it
'Cause life is a bitch, she's a bow-legged ho
But now those days are over
I Harvey Weinstein a bathrobe hanging open
My code name is groper, I role play with lotion
I fuck the whole world then I throw away the Trojan
Old lederhosen with home-made explosives
I blow 80 holes in you
Don't make me go in, I OJ the flows
And I'm insult to injury, Rolaids to Goldman
I'm throat spray and Motrin, I throated Nicole
As they both there to choke and my whole blade is soakin'
I double-edge sword it 'cause one place I poke and
I stick and I turn in a rotating motion
Invisible with the pen, I'm at the pinnacle of sick individuals
Stick my dick and put the tip in at minimal
I'm fuckin' these syllables, I let 'em lick on my genitals
I'm a fucking invincible, indefensible, despicable, difficult prick
A little bit unpredictable, I spit the formidable
That you bitches fuckin' with, the original
I consider me and Nickel identicalbut not us
The only thing we have in common's I'm a dick and you suck
Otherwise one has nothin' to do with the other
None come close to skunk, bug, soldier
Tongue, shrub, shoulder, one month older
Sponge, mug, folder, nun, rug, holster
Lug nut, coaster, lung, jug, roaster
Young Thug poster, unplugged toaster

[Chorus: Eminem]
That's how much we have in common (Yah!)
That's how much we have in common (Whoa!)
Up on this mic when we're on it (Yah)
That's how much we have in common (Yeah!)
That's how much we have in common (Woo!)
That's how much we have in common
We are not alike, there's nada like us
(Man, fuck this shit, let's go)[Intro: Eminem & Justin Vernon]
(Photoshoot!)
You know, everybody's been tellin' me
What they think about me for the last few months
It's too loud
Maybe it's time I tell 'em what I think about them
Can't hear it coming down the hallway stairs from the parking lot
It's too loud
Threes not a crowd all up in it
Slow fire

[Chorus: Justin Vernon]
Don't fall on my face
Don't fall on my faith, oh
Don't fall on my fate
Don't fall on my faith, oh
Don't fall on my fate
Don't fall on my

[Verse 1: Eminem]
Gotta concentrate, against the clock I race
Got no time to waste, I'm already late, I got a marathoner's pace
Went from addict to a workaholic, word to Dr. Dre
In that first marijuana tapeguess I got a chronic case (Yeah)
And I ain't just blowin' smoke, 'less it's in your momma's face
I know this time Paul and Dre
They won't tell me what not to say (Nope!)
And though me and my party days
Have all pretty much parted ways
You'd swear to God I forgot I'm the guy that made "Not Afraid"
One last time for Charlamagne
If my response is late, it's just how long it takes
To hit my fuckin' radar, I'm so far away
These rappers are like Hunger Games
One minute, they're mockin' JAY
Next minute, they get their style from Migos or they copy Drake
Maybe I just don't know when to turn around and walk away
But all the hate, I call it Walk-on-Water-Gate
I've had as much as I can tolerate
I'm sick and tired of waitin', I done lost my patience
I can take all of you motherfuckers on at once
You wanted Shady? You got him!

[Chorus: Justin Vernon & (Eminem)]
Don't fall on my face (Yeah)
Don't fall on my faith, oh
Don't fall on my fate (Line 'em up!)
Don't fall on my faith, oh (Rrr!)
Don't fall on my fate (Look)

[Verse 2: Eminem]
Somebody tell Budden before I snap, he better fasten it
Or have his body bag get zipped
The closest thing he's had to hits is smackin' bitches (Pump it up!)
And don't make me have to give it back to Akademiks
Say this shit is trash again, I'll have you twisted
Like you had it when you thought you had me slippin' at the telly
Even when I'm gettin' brain, you'll never catch me with a thot
Lacking with it, "He ain't spittin' like this on his last shit"
Ho, you better go back and listen
You know me better, thinkin' I'll slow or let up
Call it trap 'cause it's a total setup
Hopin' that you rappers fall in that
Dre said, "Hold your head up!"Kathy Griffin
Stackin' ammunition, slap the clip in, cock it back on competition
This is how I shot ahead (Pew)Gabby Gifford
My attack is vicious, Jack the Ripper, back in business
Tyler create nothin', I see why you called yourself a f*****, bitch
It's not just 'cause you lack attention
It's because you worship D12's balls, you're sack-religious
If you're gonna critique me
You better at least be as good or better
Get Earl the Hooded Sweater
Whatever his name is to help you put together
Some words, more than just two letters
The fans waited for this moment like that feature
When I stole the show (Ha), sorry if I took forever (Ha-ha)

[Chorus: Justin Vernon & (Eminem)]
Don't fall on my face (Yeah)
Don't fall on my faith, oh (I won't)
Don't fall on my fate (Line 'em up!)
Don't fall on my faith, oh (Ha)
Don't fall on my fate (It's too easy)

[Verse 3: Eminem]
Just remember, I was here before you
And I'll be here after you make your run-in for you
Detractors, I might have to fuck Pitchfork with a corkscrew
Just what the doctor ordered
Revenge is the best medicine (Yeah)
Increase the dose, from least to most
And then tell the Grammys to go and fuck themselves
They suck the blood from all the biggest artists like some leeches
So they nominate 'em, get 'em there, get a name to MC the show
Every parasite needs a host (Ha-ha)
Then give Album of the Year to somebody that no one's ever even heard of
All I know is I wrote every single word to everything I ever murdered
Time to separate the sheep from goats (Yeah)
And I got no faith in your writers, I don't believe in ghosts
When rap needed it most, I was that wing and a prayer (Huh)
A beacon of hope, put a B-I-R-D in the air
Somewhere some kid is bumpin' this while he lip-syncs in the mirror
That's who I'm doin' it for, the rest I don't really even care
But you would think I'm carryin' an Oxford dictionary in my pocket
How I'm buryin' these artists
On a scale of 'turnt' you're 'minus'
Mine says 'very', yours says 'hardly'
And what's scary is you prob'ly can compare me to your car 'cause I'm just barely gettin' started (Woo)
And far as Lord Jamar, you better leave me the hell alone
Or I'll show you an Elvis clone
Walk up in this house you own, thrust my pelvic bone
Use your telephone and go fetch me the remote
Put my feet up and just make myself at home (Yeah)
I belong here, clown! Don't tell me 'bout the culture!
I inspired the Hopsins, the Logics, the Coles, the
Seans, the K-Dots, the 5'9"s, and oh
Brought the world 50 Cent, you did squat, piss and moan
But I'm not gonna fall bitch (Yeah)

[Outro: Justin Vernon]
It's too loud
Can't hear it coming down the hallway stairs from the parking lot
It's too loud
Threes not a crowd all up in it
Slow fire[Produced by Mark the 45 King]

[Chorus: Dido]
My tea's gone cold
I'm wondering why I got out of bed at all
The morning rain clouds up my window
And I can't see at all
And even if I could it'd all be gray
But your picture on my wall
It reminds me that it's not so bad, it's not so bad
My tea's gone cold
I'm wondering why I got out of bed at all
The morning rain clouds up my window
And I can't see at all
And even if I could it'd all be gray
But your picture on my wall
It reminds me that it's not so bad, it's not so bad

[Verse 1: Eminem (as Stan)]
Dear Slim, I wrote you, but you still ain't callin'
I left my cell, my pager and my home phone at the bottom
I sent two letters back in autumn, you must not've got 'em
There probably was a problem at the post office or somethin'
Sometimes I scribble addresses too sloppy when I jot 'em
But anyways, fuck it, what's been up, man? How's your daughter?
My girlfriend's pregnant too, I'm 'bout to be a father
If I have a daughter, guess what I'ma call her?
I'ma name her Bonnie
I read about your Uncle Ronnie too, I'm sorry
I had a friend kill himself over some bitch who didn't want him
I know you probably hear this every day, but I'm your biggest fan
I even got the underground shit that you did with Skam
I got a room full of your posters and your pictures, man
I like the shit you did with Rawkus too, that shit was phat
Anyways, I hope you get this, man, hit me back
Just to chat, truly yours, your biggest fan, this is Stan

[Chorus: Dido]
My tea's gone cold
I'm wondering why I got out of bed at all
The morning rain clouds up my window
And I can't see at all
And even if I could it'd all be gray
But your picture on my wall
It reminds me that it's not so bad, it's not so bad

[Verse 2: Eminem (as Stan)]
Dear Slim, you still ain't called or wrote, I hope you have a chance
I ain't mad, I just think it's fucked up you don't answer fans
If you didn't want to talk to me outside your concert, you didn't have to
But you coulda signed an autograph for Matthew
That's my little brother, man, he's only six years old
We waited in the blisterin' cold
For you, for four hours, and you just said no
That's pretty shitty, man, you're like his fuckin' idol
He wants to be just like you, man, he likes you more than I do
I ain't that mad, though I just don't like bein' lied to
Remember when we met in Denver?
You said if I'd write you, you would write back
See, I'm just like you in a way: I never knew my father neither
He used to always cheat on my mom and beat her
I can relate to what you're sayin' in your songs
So when I have a shitty day, I drift away and put 'em on
Cause I don't really got shit else
So that shit helps when I'm depressed
I even got a tattoo with your name across the chest
Sometimes I even cut myself to see how much it bleeds
It's like adrenaline, the pain is such a sudden rush for me
See, everything you say is real, and I respect you cause you tell it
My girlfriend's jealous 'cause I talk about you 24/7
But she don't know you like I know you, Slim, no one does
She don't know what it was like for people like us growin' up
You gotta call me, man, I'll be the biggest fan you'll ever lose
Sincerely yours, StanP.S.: We should be together too

[Chorus: Dido]
My tea's gone cold
I'm wondering why I got out of bed at all
The morning rain clouds up my window
And I can't see at all
And even if I could it'd all be gray
But your picture on my wall
It reminds me that it's not so bad, it's not so bad

[Verse 3: Eminem (as Stan)]
Dear Mr. I'm-Too-Good-to-Call-or-Write-My-Fans
This'll be the last package I ever send your ass
It's been six months, and still no wordI don't deserve it?
I know you got my last two letters
I wrote the addresses on 'em perfect
So this is my cassette I'm sendin' you, I hope you hear it
I'm in the car right now, I'm doin' 90 on the freeway
Hey, Slim, I drank a fifth of vodka, you dare me to drive?
You know the song by Phil Collins, "In the Air of the Night"
About that guy who coulda saved that other guy from drownin'
But didn't, then Phil saw it all, then at a show he found him?
That's kinda how this is: you coulda rescued me from drownin'
Now it's too late, I'm on a thousand downers nowI'm drowsy
And all I wanted was a lousy letter or a call
I hope you know I ripped all of your pictures off the wall
I loved you, Slim, we coulda been togetherthink about it!
You ruined it now, I hope you can't sleep and you dream about it
And when you dream I hope you can't sleep and you scream about it
I hope your conscience eats at you and you can't breathe without me
See, Slimshut up, bitch! I'm tryin' to talk
Hey, Slim, that's my girlfriend screamin' in the trunk
But I didn't slit her throat, I just tied her upSee? I ain't like you
Cause if she suffocates she'll suffer more and then she'll die too
Well, gotta go, I'm almost at the bridge now
Oh, shit, I forgothow am I supposed to send this shit out?!

[Chorus: Dido]
My tea's gone cold
I'm wondering why I got out of bed at all
The morning rain clouds up my window
And I can't see at all
And even if I could it'd all be gray
But your picture on my wall
It reminds me that it's not so bad, it's not so bad

[Verse 4: Eminem]
Dear Stan, I meant to write you sooner, but I just been busy
You said your girlfriend's pregnant now, how far along is she?
Look, I'm really flattered you would call your daughter that
And here's an autograph
For your brother; I wrote it on a Starter cap
I'm sorry I didn't see you at the show, I must've missed you
Don't think I did that shit intentionally just to diss you
But what's this shit you said about you like to cut your wrists too?
I say that shit just clownin', dawg, come on, how fucked up is you?
You got some issues, Stan, I think you need some counselin'
To help your ass from bouncin'
Off the walls when you get down some
And what's this shit about us meant to be together?
That type of shit'll make me not want us to meet each other
I really think you and your girlfriend need each other
Or maybe you just need to treat her better
I hope you get to read this letter, I just hope it reaches you in time
Before you hurt yourself, I think that you'll be doin' just fine
If you relax a little, I'm glad I inspire you, but Stan
Why are you so mad? Try to understand
That I do want you as a fan
I just don't want you to do some crazy shit
I seen this one shit on the news a couple weeks ago that made me sick
Some dude was drunk and drove his car over a bridge
And had his girlfriend in the trunk
And she was pregnant with his kid
And in the car they found a tape, but they didn't say who it was to
Come to think about it, his name wasit was you, damn[Intro: Obie Trice]
Obie Trice! Real name, no gimmicks (*record scratch*)

[Refrain 1: Eminem]
Two trailer park girls go 'round the outside
'Round the outside, 'round the outside
Two trailer park girls go 'round the outside
'Round the outside, 'round the outside

[Refrain 2: Eminem]
Guess who's back, back again
Shady's back, tell a friend
Guess who's back, guess who's back
Guess who's back, guess who's back
Guess who's back, guess who's back
Guess who's back

[Verse 1: Eminem]
I've created a monster, 'cause nobody wants to
See Marshall no more, they want Shady, I'm chopped liver
Well, if you want Shady, this is what I'll give ya
A little bit of weed mixed with some hard liquor
Some vodka that'll jump start my heart quicker
Than a shock when I get shocked at the hospital
By the doctor when I'm not co-operating
When I'm rocking the table while he's operating (Hey!)
You waited this long, now stop debating
Cause I'm back, I'm on the rag and ovulating
I know that you got a job, Ms. Cheney
But your husband's heart problem's complicating
So the FCC won't let me be
Or let me be me, so let me see
They try to shut me down on MTV
But it feels so empty without me
So, come on and dip, bum on your lips
Fuck that! Cum on your lips and some on your tits
And get ready, cause this shit's about to get heavy
I just settled all my lawsuitsfuck you, Debbie!

[Chorus: Eminem]
Now this looks like a job for me
So everybody, just follow me
Cause we need a little controversy
Cause it feels so empty without me
I said this looks like a job for me
So everybody, just follow me
Cause we need a little controversy
Cause it feels so empty without me

[Verse 2: Eminem]
Little hellions, kids feeling rebellious
Embarrassed their parents still listen to Elvis
They start feeling like prisoners helpless
'Til someone comes along on a mission and yells, "Bitch!"
A visionary, vision is scary
Could start a revolution, polluting the airwaves
A rebel, so just let me revel and bask
In the fact that I got everyone kissing my ass (*smack*)
And it's a disaster, such a catastrophe
For you to see so damn much of my assyou asked for me?
Well, I'm back, na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na
Fix your bent antenna, tune it in, and then I'm gonna
Enter in, and up under your skin like a splinter
The center of attention, back for the winter
I'm interesting, the best thing since wrestling
Infesting in your kid's ears and nesting
Testing, "Attention please"
Feel the tension soon as someone mentions me
Here's my ten cents, my two cents is free
A nuisance, who sent? You sent for me?

[Chorus: Eminem]
Now this looks like a job for me
So everybody, just follow me
Cause we need a little controversy
Cause it feels so empty without me
I said this looks like a job for me
So everybody, just follow me
Cause we need a little controversy
Cause it feels so empty without me

[Verse 3: Eminem]
A tisk-it a task-it, I'll go tit for tat with
Anybody who's talking "this shit, that shit"
Chris Kirkpatrick, you can get your ass kicked
Worse than them little Limp Bizkit bastards
And Moby? You can get stomped by Obie
You 36-year-old baldheaded fag, blow me
You don't know me, you're too old, let go
It's over, nobody listens to techno
Now let's go, just give me the signal
I'll be there with a whole list full of new insults
I've been dope, suspenseful with a pencil
Ever since Prince turned himself into a symbol
But sometimes the shit just seems
Everybody only wants to discuss me
So this must mean I'm disgusting
But it's just me, I'm just obscene
Though I'm not the first king of controversy
I am the worst thing since Elvis Presley
To do black music so selfishly
And use it to get myself wealthy (Hey!)
There's a concept that works
Twenty million other white rappers emerge
But no matter how many fish in the sea
It'd be so empty without me

[Chorus: Eminem]
Now this looks like a job for me
So everybody, just follow me
Cause we need a little controversy
Cause it feels so empty without me
I said this looks like a job for me
So everybody, just follow me
Cause we need a little controversy
Cause it feels so empty without me

[Outro: Eminem]
Hum dei dei la la, la la la la la
La la la la la, la la la la
Hum dei dei la la, la la la la la
La la la la la, la la la la
Kids![Intro]
May I have your attention, please?
May I have your attention, please?
Will the real Slim Shady please stand up?
I repeat, will the real Slim Shady please stand up?
We're gonna have a problem here...

[Verse 1]
Y'all act like you never seen a white person before
Jaws all on the floor like Pam like Tommy just burst in the door
And started whoopin' her ass worse than before
They first were divorced, suin' her over furniture (Agh!)
It's the return of the "Ah, wait, no way, you're kidding
He didn't just say what I think he did, did he?"
And Dr. Dre said nothing, you idiots!
Dr. Dre's dead, he's locked in my basement (ha ha!)
Feminist women love Eminem
"Chicka, chicka, chicka, Slim Shady, I'm sick of him
Look at him, walkin' around, grabbin' his you-know-what
Flippin' the you-know-who," "Yeah, but he's so cute though."
Yeah, I probably got a couple of screws up in my head loose
But no worse than what's goin' on in your parents' bedrooms
Sometimes I wanna get on TV and just let loose
But can't, but it's cool for Tom Green to hump a dead moose
"My bum is on your lips, my bum is on your lips"
And if I'm lucky, you might just give it a little kiss
And that's the message that we deliver to little kids
And expect them not to know what a woman's clitoris is
Of course, they're gonna know what intercourse is
By the time they hit fourth grade
They've got the Discovery Channel, don't they?
We ain't nothin' but mammalswell, some of us, cannibals
Who cut other people open like cantaloupes
But if we can hump dead animals and antelopes
Then there's no reason that a man and another man can't elope
But if you feel like I feel, I got the antidote
Women, wave your pantyhose, sing the chorus, and it goes

[Chorus]
I'm Slim Shady, yes I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up?
'Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up?

[Verse 2]
Will Smith don't gotta cuss in his raps to sell records (Nope)
Well, I do, so fuck him and fuck you too!
You think I give a damn about a Grammy?
Half of you critics can't even stomach me, let alone stand me
"But Slim, what if you win, wouldn't it be weird?"
Why, so you guys could just lie to get me here?
So you can sit me here next to Britney Spears?
Shit, Christina Aguilera better switch me chairs
So I can sit next to Carson Daly and Fred Durst
And hear 'em argue over who she gave head to first
Little bitch put me on blast on MTV
"Yeah, he's cute, but I think he's married to Kim, hee-hee."
I should download her audio on MP3
And show the whole world how you gave Eminem VD (Agh!)
I'm sick of you little girl and boy groups
All you do is annoy me, so I have been sent here to destroy you
And there's a million of us just like me
Who cuss like me, who just don't give a fuck like me
Who dress like me; walk, talk and act like me
And just might be the next best thing, but not quite me

[Chorus]
'Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up?
'Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up?

[Verse 3]
I'm like a head trip to listen to, cause I'm only givin' you
Things you joke about with your friends inside your livin' room
The only difference is I got the balls to say it in front of y'all
And I don't gotta be false or sugarcoat it at all
I just get on the mic and spit it
And whether you like to admit it, I just shit it
Better than 90% of you rappers out can
Then you wonder: "How can
Kids eat up these albums like Valiums?"
It's funny, cause at the rate, I'm going, when I'm 30
I'll be the only person in the nursing home flirting
Pinching nurse's asses when I'm jacking off with Jergens
And I'm jerking, but this whole bag of Viagra isn't working
And every single person is a Slim Shady lurking
He could be working at Burger King, spittin' on your onion rings
Or in the parking lot, circling, screaming, "I don't give a fuck!"
With his windows down and his system up
So will the real Shady please stand up
And put one of those fingers on each hand up?
And be proud to be outta your mind and outta control
And one more time, loud as you can, how does it go?

[Chorus]
I'm Slim Shady, yes I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up?
'Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up?
'Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up?
'Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up?

[Outro]
Ha ha, I guess theres a Slim Shady in all of us
Fuck it, lets all stand up!

[Produced by Dr. Dre & Mel-Man][Chorus: Beyonc & Eminem]
I walk on water
But I ain't no Jesus
I walk on water
But only when it freezes (Fuck)

[Verse 1: Eminem]
Why are expectations so high? Is it the bar I set?
My arms, I stretch, but I cant reach
A far cry from it, or it's in my grasp, but as
Soon as I grab, squeeze
I lose my grip like the flying trapeze
Into the dark I plummet, now the sky's blackening
I know the marks high, butter
flies rip apart my stomach
Knowin' that no matter what bars I come with
You're gonna harp, gripe, and
That's a hard Vicodin to swallow, so I scrap these
As pressure increases like khakis
I feel the ice cracking, because

[Chorus: Beyonc & Eminem]
I walk on water
But I ain't no Jesus
(It's the curse of the, it's the curse of the)
I walk on water (Shit)
But only when it freezes

[Verse 2: Eminem]
It's the curse of the standard, that the first of the Mathers disc set
Always in search of the verse that I havent spit yet
Will this step just be another misstep
To tarnish whatever the legacy, love or respect
Ive garnered? The rhyme has to be perfect, the delivery flawless
And it always feels like I'm hittin the mark
'Til I go sit in the car, listen and pick it apart
Like, "This shit is garbage!"
God's given me all this, still I feel no different regardless
Kids look to me as a god, this is retarded
If only they knew, it's a facade and its exhaustive
And I try not to listen to nonsense
But if you bitches are tryin' to strip me of my confidence
Mission accomplished
I'm not God-sent, Nas, Rakim, 'Pac, B.I.G., James Todd Smith
And I'm not Prince, so

[Chorus: Beyonc & Eminem]
I walk on water
But I ain't no Jesus
I walk on water
(It's true, I'm a Rubik's, it's true)
But only when it freezes
(It's true)

[Post-Chorus: Beyonc]
'Cause I'm only human, just like you
Making my mistakes, oh if you only knew
I don't think you should believe in me the way that you do
'Cause I'm terrified to let you down, oh

[Verse 3: Eminem]
It's true, I'm a Rubik'sa beautiful mess
At times juvenile, yes, I goof and I jest
A flawed human, I guess
But I'm doin' my best to not ruin your ex
pectations and meet 'em, but first
The "Speedom" verse, now Big Sean
He's goin' too fast, is he gonna shout or curse out his mom?
There was a time I had the world by the balls, eatin' out my palm
Every album song I was spazzin' the fuck out on
And now I'm gettin' clowned and frowned on
But the only one who's looking down on
Me that matters now's DeShaun
Am I lucky to be around this long?
Begs the question though
Especially after the methadone
As yesterday fades and the Dresden home
Is burnt to the ground and all that's left of my house is lawn
The crowds are gone
And it's time to wash out the blonde
Sales decline, the curtain's drawn
They're closin' the set, I'm still pokin' my head from out behind
And everyone who has doubt, remind
Now take your best rhyme, outdo it, now do it a thousand times
Now let 'em tell ya the world no longer cares
Or gives a fuck about your rhymes
And as I grow outta site, outta mind, I might go outta mine
'Cause how do I ever let this mic go without a fight
When I made a fuckin' tightrope outta twine?
But when I do fall from these heights though, I'll be fine
I won't pout or cry or spiral down or whine
But I'll decide if it's my final bow this time around, 'cause

[Chorus: Beyonc]
I walk on water
But I ain't no Jesus
I walk on water
But only when it freezes

[Post-Chorus: Beyonc]
'Cause I'm only human, just like you
I've been making my mistakes, oh if you only knew
I don't think you should believe in me the way that you do
'Cause I'm terrified to let you down, oh
If I walked on water, I would drown

[Outro: Eminem]
'Cause I'm just a man
But as long as I got a mic, I'm godlike
So me and you are not alike
Bitch, I wrote "Stan"[Intro]
(Fack) Okay, (Fack) how do I say this? (Fack)
Last year (Fack) didn't work out so well for me (Fack)
(Fack last year!) (Fack) (Last year can eat a dick!)
2018, (Fack) well (Fack)

[Verse 1]
Hah, yeah, I'm a fuckin' kamikaze crashin' into everything
You beat me, Islamic Nazi, that means there is no such thing
I've been goin' for your jugular since Craig G "Duck Alert"
Wedgie in my underwear, the whole bed sheet and the comforter
Stuck up in my rectal crack, kiss my disrespectful ass
I'll ride through your cul-de-sac
Window cracked, bumpin' your reference tracks
Y-You collaborative effort rap, I-I have never said his raps
O-Overstayed my welcome, stepped in crap
And ruined your welcome mat
So spit that shit from the heart, you didn't write like you wrote it (Wrote it) (Yeah)
While I teabag the microphone 'cause I go nuts on it (On it) (Yeah)
Like a fighter jet lined with explosives that'll strike any moment
Headed right at opponents and I'm the fuckin' pilot that flown it
I'm 'bout to

[Chorus]
Smash into everyone, crash into everything
Back and I've just begun, "FACK" 2017
Fack, fack on everyone
Fack, fack on everyone
Fack, fack on everyone
I'm a Kamikaze, gonna
Smash into everyone, crash like an F-15
Damage already done, y'all shoulda let me be
Fack, fack on everyone
Fack, fack on everyone
Fack, fack on everyone
I'm a Kamikaze, gonna

[Verse 2]
I turned to rap 'cause it made me feel tough when I wasn't (Wasn't)
From the moment I heard rappers cussin', I was in (Was in)
Which is why I identify with the guy
Who I was invented by, Dre's Frankenstein
Energized like a nine volt
Ice cold like Snake Eyes, twice in a row on a dice roll
But if the only reason I blowed is 'cause I'm white though
Why don't every other white rapper sell what I sold? (Ooh)
Kamikaze pilot, I wrote my suicide note
Here come the guys in white coats tryin' to stop me
'Fore I jump behind the controls and try to fly into foes
'Cause I'm takin' y'all with me when I go cyclone
I don't think this typhoon's letting up any time soon, here I go
Eyes closed, blindfolded, I'm 'bout to

[Chorus]
Smash into everyone, crash into everything
Back and I've just begun, "FACK" 2017
Fack, fack on everyone
Fack, fack on everyone
Fack, fack on everyone
I'm a Kamikaze, gonna
Smash into everyone, crash like an F-15
Damage already done, y'all should'a let me be
Fack, fack on everyone
Fack, fack on everyone
Fack, fack on everyone
I'm a Kamikaze, gonna

[Bridge]
Smash
Kamikaze, kamikaze
Kami, kami-kamikaze, kamikaze, kami-kamikaze (kamikaze)
Take a look at what I've done

[Verse 3]
I heard your freestyle on Shade 45, that shit was embarrassing
There is no way we ever air that shit again, I guarantee that
Wait, that shit was so ass it's somethin' we wouldn't dare re-air it
The shit's embarrassing as me rear-ending Tara Reid bare
In my therapy chair, my dick is the hair length of Cher
Each nut is the chair width of an Acorn stairlift, beware of me
Lyrically I'm terrible, better get your lyrics prepared
Richard Ramirez is here, serial killin' every beat there is
Wait, wait, got the eeriest feelin'
Somethin' evil is lurkin', I'm no conspiracy theorist
But somethin' here is a footoh yeah, it's my dick
Get the measurin' stick (What?), 12 inches of wood (Haha)
Wait, but I've been goin' for your jugular since Craig G "Duck Alert"
And I've come to pay respects
'Cause if you sleep you're fuckedother words
You get laid to rest and I hope your butt is hurt
Put me on a track, I go cray-on it like a color book
You got some views, but you're still below me
Mine are higher, so when you compare our views, you get overlooked
And I don't say the hook unless I wrote the hook
And now I'm just freestylin' in the vocal booth
And you know I've always spoke the truth
You're lyin' through your teeth so much you broke a tooth
And it ain't somethin' I need a phone to do
When I say I can't wait 'til I get ahold of you
And I don't know what I'm s'posed to do
Line up the rappers, take my pic like a photo shoot[Intro: Eminem]
'Cause sometimes you just feel tired, feel weak
(Yo left, yo left, yo left, right, left)
And when you feel weak (Yo left)
You feel like you wanna just give up (Yo left, yo left)
But you gotta search within you (Right, left)
Try to find that inner strength (Yo left, yo left)
And just pull that shit out of you (Yo left)
And get that motivation to not give up (Right, left, yo left)
And not be a quitter, no matter how bad you wanna just fall
(Yo left, yo left, right, left)
Flat on your face and collapse

[Verse 1: Eminem]
'Til I collapse I'm spillin' these raps long as you feel 'em
'Til the day that I drop you'll never say that I'm not killin' 'em
Cause when I am not, then I'ma stop pennin' 'em
And I am not hip-hop and I'm just not Eminem
Subliminal thoughts, when I'ma stop sendin' 'em?
Women are caught in webs, spin 'em and hock venom
Adrenaline shots of penicillin could not get the illin' to stop
Amoxicillin's just not real enough
The criminal, cop-killin', hip-hop villain
A minimal swap to cop millions of Pac listeners
You're comin' with me, feel it or not
You're gonna fear it like I showed you the spirit of God lives in us
You hear it a lot, lyrics to shock
Is it a miracle or am I just product of pop fizzin' up?
Fo' shizzle, my wizzle, this is the plot, listen up
You bizzles forgot, Slizzle does not give a fuck

[Chorus: Nate Dogg]
'Til the roof comes off, 'til the lights go out
'Til my legs give out, can't shut my mouth
'Til the smoke clears out, am I high? Perhaps
I'ma rip this shit 'til my bones collapse
(Until the roof) 'Til the roof comes off, 'til the lights go out
(The roof comes off) 'Til my legs give out, can't shut my mouth
(Until my legs) 'Til the smoke clears out, am I high? Perhaps
(Give out from underneath me) I'ma rip this shit 'til my bones collapse

[Verse 2: Eminem]
Music is like magic, there's a certain feelin' you get
When you real and you spit, and people are feelin' your shit
This is your moment, and every single minute you spend
Tryna hold on to it 'cause you may never get it again
So while you're in it, try to get as much shit as you can
And when your run is over, just admit when it's at its end
'Cause I'm at the end of my wits with half the shit that gets in
I got a list, here's the order of my list that it's in
It goes Reggie, Jay-Z, 2Pac and Biggie
Andr from OutKast, Jada, Kurupt, Nas, and then me
But in this industry I'm the cause of a lot of envy
So when I'm not put on this list, the shit does not offend me
That's why you see me walk around like nothing's botherin' me
Even though half you people got a fuckin' problem with me
You hate it, but you know respect you got to give me
The press's wet dream, like Bobby and Whitney  Nate, hit me!

[Chorus: Nate Dogg]
'Til the roof comes off, 'til the lights go out
'Til my legs give out, can't shut my mouth
'Til the smoke clears out, am I high? Perhaps
I'ma rip this shit 'til my bones collapse
(Until the roof) 'Til the roof comes off, 'til the lights go out
(The roof comes off) 'Til my legs give out, can't shut my mouth
(Until my legs) 'Til the smoke clears out, am I high? Perhaps
(Give out from underneath me) I'ma rip this shit 'til my bones collapse

[Verse 3: Eminem]
Soon as a verse starts, I eat at an MC's heart
What is he thinking? How not to go against me, smart
And it's absurd how people hang on every word
I'll prob'ly never get the props I feel I ever deserve
But I'll never be served, my spot is forever reserved
If I ever leave Earth, that would be the death of me first
Cause in my heart of hearts I know nothin' could ever be worse
That's why I'm clever when I put together every verse
My thoughts are sporadic, I act like I'm an addict
I rap like I'm addicted to smack like I'm Kim Mathers
But I don't wanna go forth and back in constant battles
The fact is I would rather sit back and bomb some rappers
So this is like a full-blown attack I'm launchin' at 'em
The track is on some battlin' raps, who wants some static?
Cause I don't really think that the fact that I'm Slim matters
A plaque and platinum status is whack if I'm not the baddest, so

[Chorus: Nate Dogg]
'Til the roof comes off, 'til the lights go out
'Til my legs give out, can't shut my mouth
'Til the smoke clears out, am I high? Perhaps
I'ma rip this shit 'til my bones collapse
(Until the roof) 'Til the roof comes off, 'til the lights go out
(The roof comes off) 'Til my legs give out, can't shut my mouth
(Until my legs) 'Til the smoke clears out, am I high? Perhaps
(Give out from underneath me) I'ma rip this shit 'til my bones collapse

[Outro: Eminem & (Nate Dogg)]
Until the roof (Until the roof)
The roof comes off (The roof comes off)
Until my legs (Until my legs)
Give out from (Underneath me)
I, I will not fall, I will stand tall
Feels like no one can beat mePart 1: Produced by S1 and M-Phazes

[Verse 1]
It's like I'm in this dirt, digging up old hurt
Tried everything to get my mind off you, it won't work
All it takes is one song on the radio, you're
Right back on it, reminding me all over again
How you fucking just brushed me off and left me so burnt
Spent a lot of time tryin' to soul search
Maybe I needed to grow up a little first
Well, looks like I hit a growth spurt
But I'm coming for closure
Don't suppose an explanation I'm owed, for
The way that you turned your back on me
Just when I may have needed you most
Oh, you thought it was over? You could just close the
Chapter and go about your life like it was nothing?
You ruined mine, but you seem to be doin' fine
Well, I've never recovered
But tonight I bet you that what you're
'Bout to go through's tougher than anything I ever have suffered
Can't think of a better way to define poetic justice
Can I hold grudges? Mind saying, "Let it go, fuck this."
Heart's saying, "I will, once I bury this bitch alive
Hide the shovel and then drive off in the sunset."

[Chorus: Sarah Jaffe]
I flee the scene like it was my last ride
You see right through
Oh, you had me pegged the first time
You can see the truth, but it's easier to justify
What's bad is good and I hate to be the bad guy
I just hate to be the bad guy
(Follow me, I ruh-uh-un; follow me, I ruh-uh-un)
I just hate to be the bad guy
(Follow me, I ruh-uh-un; follow me, I ruh-uh-un)

[Verse 2]
And to think I used to think you was the shit, bitch
To think it was you at one time I worshipped, shit
Think you can hurt people and just keep getting away with it?
Not this time, you better go and get the sewing kit, bitch!
Finish this stitch, so you can reap what you sew, nitwit
Thought some time would pass and I'd forget it? Forget it!
You left our family in shambles
And you expect me to just get over him, pretend he never existed?
May be gone but he's not forgotten
And don't think cause he's been out the pictures
So long that I've stopped the plottin' and still ain't comin' to get ya
You're wrong and that shit was rotten
And the way you played him, same shit you did to me, cold
Have you any idea the shit that I've gone through?
Feelings I harbor? All this pent-up resentment I hold on to?
Not once you call to ask me how I'm doin'
Letters, you don't respond to 'em
Fuck it, I'm coming to see you
And, gee, who better to talk to than you?
The cause of my problems
My life is garbage, and I'm 'bout to take it out on you
Poof, then I'm gone, voosh

[Chorus: Sarah Jaffe]
I flee the scene like it was my last ride
You see right through
Oh, you had me pegged the first time
You can see the truth, but it's easier to justify
What's bad is good and I hate to be the bad guy
I just hate to be the bad guy
(Follow me, I ruh-uh-un; follow me, I ruh-uh-un)
I just hate to be the bad guy
(Follow me, I ruh-uh-un; follow me, I ruh-uh-un)

[Verse 3]
I've been drivin' around your side of this town
Like 9 frickin' hours and 45 minutes now
Finally I found your new address, park in your drive
Feel like I've been waiting on this moment all of my life
And it's now arrived, and my mouth is full of saliva
My knife is out and I'm ducking on the side of your house
See, it's sad it came to this point
Such a disappointment I had to make this appointment
To come and see ya, but I ain't here for your empathy
I don't need your apology or your friendship or sympathy
It's revenge that I seek
So I sneak vengefully, and treat your bedroom window
Like I reached my full potential: I peeked
Continue to peep, still bent low, then keep
Tapping the glass lightly then start to crescendo, sneak
All the way 'round to the back porch
Man, door handles unlocked, shouldn't be that easy to do this
You don't plan for intruders beforehand?
Surprised to see me? Cat caught your tongue?
Gag, chloroform rag, dag, almost hack-up a lung
Like you picked an axe up and swung, stick to the core plan
Dragged to the back of a trunk by one of your fans
Irony's spectacular, huh? Now who's a faggot, you punk?
And here's your Bronco hat
You can have that shit back cause they suck
It's just me, you and the music now, Slim, I hope you hear it
We're in the car right now  wait, here comes my favorite lyric
"I'm the bad guy who makes fun of people that die"
And hey, here's a sequel to my
Mathers LP just to try to get people to buy
How's this for a publicity stunt? This should be fun!
Last album now, cause after this you'll be officially done
Eminem killed by M and M, Matthew Mitchell
Bitch, I even have your initials
I initially was gonna bury you next to my brother, but fuck it
Since you're in love with your city so much, I figured, what the fuck
The best place you could be buried alive is right here
Two more exits, time is quite near
Hope we don't get stopped, no license I fear
That sirens I hear? Guess 90 on the freeway wasn't the brightest idea, as cops appear in my driver's side mirror
(Oh, God! Police! Aaaghh!)
Hope Foxtrot gets an aerial shot of your burial plot, at least
New plan, Stan!
Slim: "Chauvinist pig drove in this big Lincoln Town Car"
Well, gotta go, almost at the bridge
Ha ha, big bro, it's for you; Slim, this is for him
And Frank Ocean; oh, hope you can swim good
Now say you hate homos again!

[Verse 4]
I also represent
Anyone on the receiving end of those jokes you offend
I'm the nightmare you fell asleep and then woke up still in
I'm your karma closing in with each stroke of a pen
Perfect time to have some remorse to show for your sin
Nope, it's hopeless, I'm the denial that you're hopelessly in
When they say all of this is approachin' its end
But you refuse to believe that it's over, here we go all over again
Back's to the wall, I'm stacking up all them odds
Toilets clogged, yeah, cause I'm talking a lot of
Shit but I'm backing it all up
But in my head there's a voice in the back and it hollers
After the track is demolished, I am your lack of a conscience
I'm the ringing in your ears
I'm the polyps on the back of your tonsils
Eatin' your vocal chords after your concerts
I'm your time that's almost up that you haven't acknowledged
Grab for some water
But I'm that pill that's too jagged to swallow
I'm the bullies you hate that you became
With every faggot you slaughtered
Coming back on you, every woman you insult
Batter, but the double-standards you have
When it comes to your daughters
I represent everything you take for granted
Cause Marshall Mathers, the rapper's persona
Is half a facade, and Matthew and Stan's just symbolic
Of you not knowing what you had 'til it's gone
Cause after all the glitz and the glam
No more fans that are calling your name
Cameras are off, sad, but it happens to all of them
I'm the hindsight to say, I told you so!
Foreshadows of all the things that are to follow
I'm the future that's here to show you what happens tomorrow
If you don't stop after they call ya
Biggest laughing stock of rap who can't call it quits
When it's time to walk away, I'm every guilt trip
The baggage you have, but as you gather up all your possessions
If there's anything you have left to say
'Less it makes an impact, then don't bother
So 'fore you rest your case
Better make sure you're packin' a wallop
So, one last time, I'm back
Before it fades into black and it's all over
Behold the final chapter in a saga
Tryin' to recapture that lightning trapped in a bottle
Twice, the magic that started
It all, tragic portrait of an artist
Tortured, trapped in his own drawings
Tap into thoughts blacker and darker
Than anything imaginable; here goes a wild stab in the dark
As we pick up where the last Mathers left off[Chorus: Rihanna]
Just gonna stand there and watch me burn?
Well, that's all right because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry?
Well, that's all right because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie

[Verse 1: Eminem]
I can't tell you what it really is, I can only tell you what it feels like
And right now, there's a steel knife in my windpipe
I can't breathe, but I still fight while I can fight
As long as the wrong feels right, it's like I'm in flight
High off her love, drunk from her hate
It's like I'm huffin' paint and I love her, the more I suffer, I suffocate
And right before I'm about to drown, she resuscitates
Me, she fuckin' hates me, and I love it  "Wait!
Where you going?"  "I'm leaving you!"  "No, you ain't!
Come back!"  We're runnin' right back, here we go again
It's so insane, 'cause when it's goin' good, it's goin' great
I'm Superman with the wind at his back, she's Lois Lane
But when it's bad, it's awful, I feel so ashamed
I snapped, "Who's that dude?", I don't even know his name
I laid hands on her, I'll never stoop so low again
I guess I don't know my own strength

[Chorus: Rihanna]
Just gonna stand there and watch me burn?
Well, that's all right because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry?
Well, that's all right because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie

[Verse 2: Eminem]
You ever love somebody so much you can barely breathe when you're with 'em?
You meet, and neither one of you even know what hit 'em
Got that warm fuzzy feelin', yeah, them chills, used to get 'em
Now you're gettin' fuckin' sick of lookin' at 'em?
You swore you'd never hit 'em, never do nothin' to hurt 'em
Now you're in each other's face spewin' venom in your words when you spit 'em
You push, pull each other's hair, scratch, claw, bit 'em
Throw 'em down, pin 'em, so lost in the moments when you're in 'em
It's the rage that took over, it controls you both
So they say you're best to go your separate ways, guess that they don't know ya
'Cause today, that was yesterday, yesterday is over
It's a different day, sound like broken records playin' over
But you promised her, next time you'll show restraint
You don't get another chance, life is no Nintendo game, but you lied again
Now you get to watch her leave out the window
Guess that's why they call it window pane

[Chorus: Rihanna]
Just gonna stand there and watch me burn?
Well, that's all right because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry?
Well, that's all right because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie

[Verse 3: Eminem]
Now, I know we said things, did things that we didn't mean
Then we fall back into the same patterns, same routine
But your temper's just as bad as mine is, you're the same as me
When it comes to love you're just as blinded, baby, please
Come back, it wasn't you, baby, it was me
Maybe our relationship isn't as crazy as it seems
Maybe that's what happens when a tornado meets a volcano
All I know is I love you too much to walk away though
Come inside, pick up your bags off the sidewalk
Don't you hear sincerity in my voice when I talk?
Told you this is my fault, look me in the eyeball
Next time I'm pissed, I'll aim my fist at the drywall
Next time? There won't be no next time!
I apologize, even though I know it's lies
I'm tired of the games, I just want her back, I know I'm a liar
If she ever tries to fuckin' leave again, I'ma tie her
To the bed and set this house on fire, just gonna

[Chorus: Rihanna]
Just gonna stand there and watch me burn?
Well, that's all right because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry?
Well, that's all right because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie[B-Rabbit (Eminem)]
Now, everybody from the 313
Put your motherfucking hands up and follow me!
Everybody from the 313
Put your motherfucking hands up! Look, look...
Now, while he stands tough
Notice that this man did not have his hands up
This Free World's got you gassed up
Now, who's afraid of the Big Bad Wolf?
One, two, three, and to the four
One Pac, two Pac, three Pac, four
Four Pac, three Pac, two Pac, one
You're Pac, he's Pac, no Pac, none
This guy ain't no motherfucking MC
I know everything he's 'bout to say against me
I am white, I am a fucking bum
I do live in a trailer with my mom
My boy Future is an Uncle Tom
I do got a dumb friend named Cheddar Bob
Who shoots himself in his leg with his own gun
I did get jumped by all six of you chumps
And Wink did fuck my girl
I'm still standing here screaming, "Fuck the Free World!"
Don't ever try to judge me, dude
You don't know what the fuck I've been through
But I know something about you
You went to Cranbrook, that's a private school
What's the matter, dawg? You embarrassed?
This guy's a gangster? His real name's Clarence
And Clarence lives at home with both parents
And Clarence parents have a real good marriage
This guy don't wanna battle, he's shook
'Cause ain't no such things as halfway crooks
He's scared to death, he's scared to look
At his fucking yearbook; fuck Cranbrook!
Fuck a beat, I'll go a cappella
Fuck a Papa Doc, fuck a clock, fuck a trailer
Fuck everybody! Fuck y'all if you doubt me!
I'm a piece of fucking white trash, I say it proudly
And fuck this battle, I don't wanna win, I'm outtie
Here, tell these people something they don't know about me

[Papa Doc (Anthony Mackie)]
Yo...[Intro]
Yeah, I know sometimes things may not always make sense to you right now. But hey, what'd Daddy always tell you? Straighten up, little soldier, stiffen up that upper lip! What you cryin' about? You got me

[Verse 1]
Hailie, I know you miss your mom, and I know you miss your dad
When I'm gone, but I'm tryin' to give you the life that I never had
I can see you're sad, even when you smile, even when you laugh
I can see it in your eyes, deep inside you wanna cry
'Cause you're scared, I ain't there
Daddy's with you in your prayers
No more cryin', wipe them tears
Daddy's here, no more nightmares
We gon' pull together through it
We gon' do it, LainieUncle's crazy, ain't he?
Yeah, but he loves you, girl, and you better know it
We're all we got in this world, when it spins, when it swirls
When it whirls, when it twirls, two little beautiful girls
Lookin' puzzled, in a daze, I know it's confusin' you
Daddy's always on the move, Momma's always on the news
I try to keep you sheltered from it, but somehow it seems
The harder that I try to do that, the more it backfires on me
All the things growin' up as Daddy that he had to see
Daddy don't want you to see, but you see just as much as he did
We did not plan it to be this way, your mother and me
But things have got so bad between us, I don't see us ever bein'
Together ever again, like we used to be when we was teenagers
But then, of course, everything always happens for a reason
I guess it was never meant to be, but it's just something
We have no control over, and that's what destiny is
But no more worries, rest your head and go to sleep
Maybe one day we'll wake up and this'll all just be a dream

[Hook]
Now hush, little baby, don't you cry
Everything's gonna be alright
Stiffen that upper lip up, little lady, I told ya
Daddy's here to hold ya through the night
I know Mommy's not here right now, and we don't know why
We fear how we feel inside
It may seem a little crazy, pretty baby
But I promise, Momma's gon' be alright (heh)

[Verse 2]
It's funny, I remember back one year when Daddy had no money
Mommy wrapped the Christmas presents up and stuck 'em under the tree
And said some of 'em were from me 'cause Daddy couldn't buy 'em
I'll never forget that Christmas, I sat up the whole night cryin'
'Cause Daddy felt like a bumsee, Daddy had a job
But his job was to keep the food on the table for you and Mom
And at the time, every house that we lived in
Either kept gettin' broken into and robbed or shot up on the block
And your mom was savin' money for you in a jar
Tryin' to start a piggy bank for you so you could go to college
Almost had a thousand dollars, 'til someone broke in and stole it
And I know it hurt so bad it broke your momma's heart
And it seemed like everything was just startin' to fall apart
Mom and Dad was arguin' a lot, so Momma moved back
On to Chalmers in the flat, one bedroom apartment
And Dad moved back to the other side of 8 Mile on Novara
And that's when Daddy went to California with his CD
And met Dr. Dre and flew you and Momma out to see me
But Daddy had to work, you and Momma had to leave me
Then you started seein' Daddy on the TV, and Momma didn't like it
And you and Lainie were too young to understand it
Papa was a rolling stone, Momma developed a habit
And it all happened too fast for either one of us to grab it
I'm just sorry you were there and had to witness it first hand
'Cause all I ever wanted to do was just make you proud
Now I'm sittin' in this empty house
Just reminiscin', lookin' at your baby pictures, it just trips me out
To see how much you both have grown, it's almost like you're sisters now
Wow, guess you pretty much are, and Daddy's still here
Lainie, I'm talkin' to you too, Daddy's still here
I like the sound of that, yeah, it's got a ring to it, don't it?
Sshh! Momma's only gone for the moment

[Hook]
Now hush, little baby, don't you cry
Everything's gonna be alright
Stiffen that upper lip up, little lady, I told ya
Daddy's here to hold ya through the night
I know Mommy's not here right now, and we don't know why
We fear how we feel inside
It may seem a little crazy, pretty baby
But I promise, Momma's gon' be alright

[Hook 2]
And if you ask me to, Daddy's gonna buy you a mockingbird
I'ma give you the world
I'ma buy a diamond ring for you, I'ma sing for you
I'll do anything for you to see you smile
And if that mockingbird don't sing and that ring don't shine
I'ma break that birdie's neck
I'll go back to the jeweler who sold it to ya
And make him eat every carat, don't fuck with Dad! (Ha-ha!)[Produced by Emile Haynie & Jeff Bhasker]

[Intro: Nate Ruess]
Mom, I know I let you down
And though you say the days are happy
Why is the power off and I'm fucked up?
And, Mom, I know he's not around
But don't you place the blame on me
As you pour yourself another drink, yeah

[Chorus: Nate Ruess]
I guess we are who we are
Headlights shining in the dark night, I drive on
Maybe we took this too far

[Verse 1: Eminem]
I went in headfirst, never thinkin' about who what I said hurt
In what verse, my mom probably got it the worst
The brunt of it, but as stubborn as we are, did I take it too far?
"Cleanin' Out My Closet" and all them other songs
But regardless, I don't hate you cause, Ma
You're still beautiful to me, cause you're my mom
Though far be it from you to be calm
Our house was Vietnam, Desert Storm
And both of us put together could form an atomic bomb
Equivalent to chemical warfare
And forever we could drag this on and on
But agree to disagree, that gift for me
Up under the Christmas tree don't mean shit to me
You're kickin' me out? It's 15 degrees
And it's Christmas Eve, "Little prick, just leave!"
Ma, let me grab my fucking coat!
Anything to have each other's goats
Why we always at each other's throats?
Especially when Dad, he fucked us both
We're in the same fuckin' boat
You'd think that'd make us close (Nope)
Further away it drove us, but together, headlights shine
And a car full of belongings, still got a ways to go
Back to grandma's house, it's straight up the road
And I was the man of the house, the oldest
So my shoulders carried the weight of the load
Then Nate got taken away by the state at eight years old
And that's when I realized you were sick
And it wasn't fixable or changeable
And to this day we remain estranged, and I hate it though, but

[Chorus: Nate Ruess]
I guess we are who we are
Headlights shining in the dark night, I drive on
Maybe we took this too far

[Verse 2: Eminem]
Cause to this day we remain estranged, and I hate it though
Cause you ain't even get to witness your grandbabies grow
But I'm sorry, Momma, for "Cleanin' Out My Closet"
At the time I was angry, rightfully? Maybe so
Never meant that far to take it though
Cause now I know it's not your fault, and I'm not makin' jokes
That song I no longer play at shows
And I cringe every time it's on the radio
And I think of Nathan being placed in a home
And all the medicine you fed us and
How I just wanted you to taste your own
But now the medication's takin' over
And your mental state's deterioratin' slow
And I'm way too old to cry, this shit is painful though
But, Ma, I forgive you, so does Nathan, yo
All you did, all you said, you did your best to raise us both
Foster care, that cross you bear, few may be as heavy as yours
But I love you, Debbie Mathers
Oh, what a tangled web we have cause
One thing I never asked was
Where the fuck my deadbeat dad was
Fuck it, I guess he had trouble keepin' up with every address
But I'da flipped every mattress, every rock and desert cactus
Owned a collection of maps
And followed my kids to the edge of the atlas
If someone ever moved 'em from me
That you coulda bet your asses
If I had to come down the chimney, dressed as Santa, kidnap 'em
And although one has only met their grandma once
You pulled up in our drive one night
As we were leavin' to get some hamburgers
Me, her and Nate, we introduced you, hugged you
And as you left I had this overwhelming sadness
Come over me as we pulled off to go our separate paths and
I saw your headlights as I looked back
And I'm mad I didn't get the chance to
Thank you for being my mom and my dad
So, Mom, please accept this as a
Tribute; I wrote this on the jet, I guess I had to
Get this off my chest, I hope I get the chance to
Lay it 'fore I'm dead, the stewardess said to fasten
My seatbelt, I guess we're crashin'
So, if I'm not dreamin', I hope you get this message that
I will always love you from afar, cause you're my mom

[Chorus: Nate Ruess]
I guess we are who we are
Headlights shining in the dark night, I drive on
Maybe we took this too far

[Bridge: Nate Ruess & Eminem]
I want a new life (Start over)
One without a cause (Clean slate)
So I'm coming home tonight (Yeah)
Well, no matter what the cost
And if the plane goes down
Or if the crew can't wake me up
Well, just know that I'm alright
I was not afraid to die
Oh, even if there's songs to sing
Well, my children will carry me
Just know that I'm alright
I was not afraid to die
Because I put my faith in my little girls
So I'll never say goodbye cruel world
Just know that I'm alright
I am not afraid to die

[Chorus: Nate Ruess]
I guess we are who we are
Headlights shining in the dark night, I drive on
Maybe we took this too far
I want a new life[Chorus: Liz Rodrigues]
This is survival of the fittest
This is do or die
This is the winner takes it all
So, take it all, a-all, a-all, a-all

[Verse 1: Eminem]
Wasn't ready to be no millionaire, I was ill-prepared
I was prepared to be ill though, the skill was there
From the beginning it wasn't 'bout the ends, it was 'bout
Bustin' raps and standin' for somethin', fuck an acronym
Cut the fuckin' act like you're happy, I'm fuckin' back again
With another anthem  why stop when it doesn't have to end?
It ain't over 'til I say it's over, enough when I say enough
Throw me to them wolves and close the gate up, I'm afraid of What'll happen to them wolves when the thought of being thrown
Into an alligator pit, I salivate at it, wait is up
Hands up like it's 12 noon, nah, homie, hold them bitches straighter up
Wave 'em 'til you dislocate a rotator cuff
Came up rough, came to ruffle feathers, nah, egos, I ain't deflate enough
Last chance to make this whole stadium erupt, 'cause

[Chorus: Liz Rodrigues]
This is survival of the fittest
This is do or die
This is the winner takes it all
So, take it all, a-all, a-all, a-all

[Verse 2: Eminem]
I can see the finish line with each line that I finish
I'm so close to my goals, I can almost pole vault over the goal post
And if I don't got enough in the tank, maybe I can just siphon enough
To fill up this last can, man, will I survive in this climate or what?
They said I was washed-up and got a bloodbath
I'm not a rapper, I'm an adapter: I can adjust
Plus, I can just walk up to a mic and just bust
So, floor's open if you'd like to discuss
Top 5 in this muh'fucka, and if I don't make the cut
What? Like I give a fuck! I'ma light this bitch up like I'm driving a truck
Through the side of a pump, 0 to 60, hop in and gun it
Like G-Unit without the hyphen, I'm hyping 'em up
And if there should ever come a time where my life's in a rut
And I look like I might just give up, eh, might've mistook
Me for bowin' out, I ain't takin' a bow, I'm stabbin' myself
With a fuckin' knife in the gut while I'm wipin' my butt
'Cause I just shitted on the mic and I like gettin' cut
I get excited at the sight of my blood, you're in a fight with a nut
'Cause I'ma fight 'til I die or win, bitin' the dust
It'll just make me angrier; wait, let me remind you of what
Got me this far, picture me quittin'
Now draw a circle around it and put a line through it, slut!
It's survival of what?

[Chorus: Liz Rodrigues]
This is survival of the fittest
This is do or die
This is the winner takes it all
So, take it all, a-all, a-all, a-all
So, take it all, a-all, a-all, a-all

[Verse 3: Eminem]
(Yeah) So, get your ideas, stack your ammo
But don't come unless you come to battle, now mount up, jump in the saddle
This is itit's what you eat, sleep, piss and shit
Live, breathe, your whole existence just consists of this
Refuse to quit, fuse is lit, can't defuse the wick
If I don't do this music shit, I'll lose my shit
Ain't got shit to lose, it's the moment of truth, it's all I know how to do
As soon as I get thrown in a booth, I spit
But my respect is overdue, I'm showin' you the flow no one do
'Cause I don't own no diploma for school, I quit
So there's nothin' for me to fall back on, I know no other trade
So you better trade your fuckin' mics in for some tool-box-es
'Cause you'll never take my pride from me, it'll have to be pried from me
So, pull out your pliers and your screwdrivers!
But I want you to doubt me, I don't want you to buh-lieve
'Cause this is somethin' that I must use to succeed
And if you don't like me, then fuck you! Self-esteem
Must be fuckin' shootin' through the roof, 'cause trust me
My skin is too thick and bulletproof to touch me
I can see why the fuck I disgust you, I must be
Allergic to failure, 'cause everytime I come close to it
I just sneeze, but I just go achoo then a-chieve!

[Chorus: Liz Rodrigues]
This is survival of the fittest
This is do or die
This is the winner takes it all
So, take it all, a-all, a-all, a-all
So, take it all, a-all, a-all, a-all[Chorus]
I'm not afraid (I'm not afraid)
To take a stand (To take a stand)
Everybody (Everybody)
Come take my hand (Come take my hand)
We'll walk this road together, through the storm
Whatever weather, cold or warm
Just lettin' you know that you're not alone
Holla if you feel like you've been down the same road

[Intro]
Yeah, it's been a ride
I guess I had to go to that place to get to this one
Now some of you might still be in that place
If you're tryna get out, just follow me
I'll get you there

[Verse 1]
You can try and read my lyrics off of this paper before I lay 'em
But you won't take the sting out these words before I say 'em
'Cause ain't no way I'ma let you stop me from causin' mayhem
When I say I'ma do somethin', I do it
I don't give a damn what you think, I'm doin' this for me
So fuck the world, feed it beans
It's gassed up if it thinks it's stoppin' me
I'ma be what I set out to be, without a doubt, undoubtably
And all those who look down on me
I'm tearin' down your balcony
No ifs, ands or buts, don't try to ask him why or how can he
From Infinite down to the last Relapse album he's still shittin'
Whether he's on salary, paid hourly
Until he bows out or he shits his bowels out of him
Whichever comes first, for better or worse
He's married to the game
Like a "fuck you" for Christmas, his gift is a curse
Forget the Earth, he's got the urge to pull his dick from the dirt
And fuck the whole universe

[Chorus]
I'm not afraid (I'm not afraid)
To take a stand (To take a stand)
Everybody (Everybody)
Come take my hand (Come take my hand)
We'll walk this road together, through the storm
Whatever weather, cold or warm
Just lettin' you know that you're not alone
Holla if you feel like you've been down the same road

[Verse 2]
Okay, quit playin' with the scissors and shit, and cut the crap
I shouldn't have to rhyme these words in a rhythm
For you to know it's a rap
You said you was king, you lied through your teeth
For that, fuck your feelings
Instead of gettin' crowned, you're gettin' capped
And to the fans, I'll never let you down again, I'm back
I promise to never go back on that promise
In fact, let's be honest, that last Relapse CD was "ehh"
Perhaps I ran them accents into the ground
Relax, I ain't goin' back to that now
All I'm tryin' to say is get back, click-clack-blaow
'Cause I ain't playin' around
There's a game called circle and I don't know how
I'm way too up to back down
But I think I'm still tryin' to figure this crap out
Thought I had it mapped out, but I guess I didn't
This fuckin' black cloud still follows me around
But it's time to exorcise these demons
These muh'fuckers are doin' jumpin' jacks now

[Chorus]
I'm not afraid (I'm not afraid)
To take a stand (To take a stand)
Everybody (Everybody)
Come take my hand (Come take my hand)
We'll walk this road together, through the storm
Whatever weather, cold or warm
Just lettin' you know that you're not alone
Holla if you feel like you've been down the same road

[Bridge]
And I just can't keep livin' this way
So startin' today
I'm breakin' out of this cage
I'm standin' up, I'ma face my demons
I'm mannin' up, I'ma hold my ground
I've had enough, now Im so fed up
Time to put my life back together right now

[Verse 3]
It was my decision to get clean, I did it for me
Admittedly I probably did it subliminally for you
So I could come back a brand-new me
You helped see me through
And don't even realize what you did, believe me you
I've been through the wringer
But they can do little to the middle finger
I think I got a tear in my eye, I feel like the king of
My world, haters can make like bees with no stingers
And drop dead: no more beef lingers
No more drama from now on, I promise
To focus solely on handlin' my responsibilities as a father
So I solemnly swear to always treat this roof like my daughters
And raise it, you couldn't lift a single shingle on it
'Cause the way I feel, I'm strong enough to go to the club
Or the corner pub and lift the whole liquor counter up
'Cause I'm raisin' the bar
I'd shoot for the moon, but I'm too busy gazin' at stars
I feel amazin', and I'm

[Chorus]
I'm not afraid (I'm not afraid)
To take a stand (To take a stand)
Everybody (Everybody)
Come take my hand (Come take my hand)
We'll walk this road together, through the storm
Whatever weather, cold or warm
Just lettin' you know that you're not alone
Holla if you feel like you've been down the same road[Intro: Haddaway, Eminem, & Lil Wayne]
Love, love
Love, love, love
[Mumbling chorus]
Don't hurt me
Don't hurt me no more
Young Money, yeah
No more
Love

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne & Haddaway]
Throw dirt on me and grow a wildflower
But it's "Fuck the world," get a child out her
Yeah, my life a bitch, but you know nothing 'bout her
Been to hell and back, I can show you vouchers (No love)
I'm rollin' Sweets, I'm smokin' sour
Married to the game, but she broke her vows
That's why my bars are full of broken bottles
And my nightstands are full of open Bibles
Uh, I think about more than I forget
But I don't go around fire expectin' not to sweat
And these niggas know I lay 'em down, make your bed
Bitches try to kick me while I'm down, I'll break your leg
Money outweighin' problems on a triple beam
I'm stickin' to the script, you niggas skippin' scenes
Uh, be good or be good at it
Fuckin' right, I got my gun, semi-Cartermatic
Yeah, put a dick in they mouth, so I guess it's fuck what they say
I'm high as a bitch, up, up and away
Man, I'll come down in a couple of days
Okay, you want me up in the cage?
Then I'll come out in beast mode
I got this world stuck in the safe, combination is the G code
It's Weezy, motherfucker, Blood gang, and I'm in bleed mode
All about my dough, but I don't even check the peephole
So you can keep knockin', but won't knock me down
No love lost, no love found

[Chorus: Eminem, Lil Wayne, Both, & (Haddaway)]
It's a little too late to say that you're sorry now (Yeah)
You kicked me when I was down
But what you say just don't (Hurt me)
That's right, it don't (Hurt me)
And I don't need you (No more)
Don't wanna see you (No more)
Ha, bitch, you get no (Love)
You showed me nothing but hate (Haha!)
You ran me into the ground
But what comes around goes around (Yeah)
And I don't need you (Don't hurt me)
That's right, you don't (Hurt me)
And I don't need you (No more)
Don't wanna see you
Ha, bitch, you get (No love)
No! (No love) No! (No love) No! (No love)
Ha, bitch, you get (No love)
No! (No love) No! (No love)
And I don't need you (No more)
Get 'em!

[Verse 2: Eminem, Lil Wayne, & Both]
I'm alive again, more alive than I have been
In my whole entire life, I can (Yeah)
See these people's ears perk up as I begin to spaz with the pen
Uh, I'm a little bit sicker than most
Shit's finna get thick again, they say the competition is stiff
But I get a hard dick from this shit and I stick it in
I ain't never giving in again (Yeah)
Caution to the wind, complete freedom
Look at these rappers, how I treat 'em
So why the fuck would I join 'em when I beat 'em? (Yeah!)
They call me a freak, 'cause I like to
Spit on these pussies 'fore I eat 'em (Haha)
Man, get these whack cocksuckers off stage!
Where the fuck is Kanye when you need him? (Oh!)
Snatch the mic from 'em, bitch, I'ma let you finish in a minute
Yeah, that rap was tight, but I'm (Yeah!)
'Bout to spit the greatest verse of all time
So you might want to go back to the lab tonight and, um (Yeah!)
Scribble out them rhymes you were gonna spit
And start over from scratch and write new ones
But I'm afraid that it ain't gonna make no difference
When I rip this stage and tear it in half tonight
It's an adrenaline rush to feel the bass thump
From the place all the way to the parking lot, fellow
Set fire to the mic and ignite the crowd (Yeah)
You can see the sparks from hot metal (Yeah)
Cold-hearted, from the day I Bogarted
The game, my soul started to rot, fellow (Yeah)
When I'm not even in my harshest
You can still get roasted, cause Marsh is not mellow
'Til I'm topplin' from the top, I'm not gonna stop
I'm standin' on my Monopoly board (Uh)
That means I'm on top of my game
And it don't stop 'til my hip don't hop anymore (Shit)
When you're so good that you can't say it
Cause it ain't even cool for you to sound cocky anymore (Shit)
People just get sick cause you spit
These fools can't drool or dribble a drop anymore (Ow!)
And you can never break my stride (Nope)
You'll never slow the momentum at any moment
I'm 'bout to blow, you'll never take my pride
Killin' the flow, slow venom
And the opponent is gettin' no mercy, mark my words
Ain't lettin' up, relentless, I smell blood
I don't give a fuck, keep givin' them hell
Where was you when I fell and needed help up?
You get no love

[Chorus: Eminem, Lil Wayne, Both, & (Haddaway)]
It's a little too late to say that you're sorry now (Uh)
You kicked me when I was down
But what you say just don't (Hurt me)
Yeah, that's right, it don't (Hurt me)
And I don't need you (No more)
Don't wanna see you (No more)
Ha, bitch, you get no (Love)
You showed me nothing but hate (Yeah!)
You ran me into the ground
But what comes around goes around
And I don't need you (Don't hurt me)
That's right, you don't (Hurt me)
And I don't need you (No more)
Don't wanna see you
Ha, bitch, you get (No love)
No! (No love) No! (No love) No! (No love)
Ha, bitch, you get (No love)
No! (No love) No! (No love)
And I don't need you (No more)
Ha, bitch, you get (No love)[Intro]
Lately I've been hard to reach
I've been too long on my own
Everybody has a private world
Where they can be alone
Are you calling me?
Are you trying to get through?
Are you reaching out for me?
Then I'm reaching out for you

[Verse 1]
I'm just so fuckin' depressed
I just can't seem to get out this slump
If I could just get over this hump
But I need somethin' to pull me out this dump
I took my bruises, took my lumps
Fell down and I got right back up
But I need that spark to get psyched back up
In order for me to pick the mic back up
I don't know how or why or when
I ended up in this position I'm in
I'm starting to feel distant again
So I decided just to pick this pen
Up and try to make an attempt to vent
But I just can't admit
Or come to grips with the fact that I may be done with rap
I need a new outlet
And I know some shit's so hard to swallow
But I just can't sit back and wallow
In my own sorrow, but I know one fact:
I'll be one tough act to follow
One tough act to follow, I'll be one tough act to follow
Here today, gone tomorrow
But you'd have to walk a thousand miles

[Pre-Chorus]
In my shoes, just to see
What it's like to be me
I'll be you, let's trade shoes
Just to see what it'd be like to
Feel your pain, you feel mine
Go inside each other's minds
Just to see what we find
Look at shit through each other's eyes

[Chorus]
But don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful
They can all get fucked, just stay true to you
Don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful
They can all get fucked, just stay true to you

[Verse 2]
I think I'm starting to lose my sense of humor
Everything's so tense and gloom
I almost feel like I gotta check the temperature
Of the room, just as soon as
I walk in, it's like all eyes on me
So I try to avoid any eye contact
Cause if I do that, then it opens a door
For conversation like I want that
I'm not lookin' for extra attention
I just wanna be just like you
Blend in with the rest of the room
Maybe just point me to the closest restroom
I don't need no fuckin' man servant
Tryna follow me around and wipe my ass
Laugh at every single joke I crack
And half of 'em ain't even funny, like, "Ha!
Marshall, you're so funny, man
You should be a comedian, goddamn!"
Unfortunately I am
I just hide behind the tears of a clown
So why don't you all sit down?
Listen to the tale I'm about to tell
Hell, we don't gotta trade our shoes
And you ain't gotta walk no thousand miles

[Pre-Chorus]
In my shoes, just to see
What it's like to be me
I'll be you, let's trade shoes
Just to see what it'd be like to
Feel your pain, you feel mine
Go inside each other's minds
Just to see what we find
Look at shit through each other's eyes

[Chorus]
But don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful
They can all get fucked, just stay true to you
Don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful
They can all get fucked, just stay true to you

[Verse 3]
Nobody asked for life to deal us
With these bullshit hands we're dealt
We gotta take these cards ourselves
And flip 'em, don't expect no help
Now, I could've either just sat on my ass and pissed and moaned
Or take this situation in which I'm placed in
And get up and get my own
I was never the type of kid to wait by the door and pack his bags
And sat on the porch and hoped and prayed
For a dad to show up who never did
I just wanted to fit in in every single place, every school I went
I dreamed of being that cool kid
Even if it meant acting stupid
Aunt Edna always told me:
"Keep making that face, it'll get stuck like that."
Meanwhile, I'm just standin' there
Holdin' my tongue, tryin' to talk like this
'Til I stuck my tongue on that frozen stop sign pole at 8 years old
I learned my lesson then
Cause I wasn't tryin' to impress my friends no mo'
But I already told you my whole life story
Not just based on my description
Cause where you see it from where you're sittin'
It's probably 110% different
I guess we would have to walk a mile in each other's shoes at least
What size you wear? I wear 10's
Let's see if you can fit your feet

[Pre-Chorus]
In my shoes, just to see
What it's like to be me
I'll be you, let's trade shoes
Just to see what it'd be like to
Feel your pain, you feel mine
Go inside each other's minds
Just to see what we find
Look at shit through each other's eyes

[Chorus]
But don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful
They can all get fucked, just stay true to you
Don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful
They can all get fucked, just stay true to you

[Bridge]
Lately I've been hard to reach
I've been too long on my own
Everybody has a private world
Where they can be alone
Are you calling me?
Are you trying to get through?
Are you reaching out for me?
Then I'm reaching out for you

[Outro]
Yeah, to my babies: stay strong
Daddy'll be home soon
And to the rest of the world: God gave you them shoes to fit you
So put 'em on and wear 'em, be yourself, man
Be proud of who you are, even if it sounds corny
Never let no one tell you you ain't beautiful[Intro]
Motherfuckers talkin' crazy (Yeah)
Sayin I should quit (Ah)
I fuckin' tell 'em make me (Bitch)
Eat a fuckin dick (Yeah)
I'm feelin' like the greatest (Woo!)
On the beat who ever did it
Mike WiLL the one who made it
It's Shady on the lyrics

[Verse 1]
I'm somewhat outlandish they say
You say we're cut from the same cloth
But I guess you fabricate, eh?
You better bring more men than the Latter Day Saints
Manic states, Stephen Paddock with automatic stay sprayin'
At anything that may stand in they way
As I stand at the bay window with a hand grenade
And a trey eight, at the Mandalay Bay
Common sense, I'm a dollar short and a day late
James Holmes at the Saturday Batman matinee
Must have missed my CAT scan that day (Yeah!)
I just threw a Tampax at Dre
Trashcan, Tascam and ashtray
Im turnin back to a madman, can't take
Anymore but I try to get away from the anger and rage
My basal ganglias an A to the K
Get your ass sprayed like bidets
Breakin' your legs eight different ways, ankle to waist
You chumps don't even know how to do somethin'
To give goosebumps a day when you say
That somethin you wrote gave someone a lump in their throat
Or you had them choked up, you'd be yankin' my chain (Ayy)
Feelin' like I'm headed for the padded cell, the
Bar for me when I rap isn't fair but
Guess that's the standard I'm held to
But if somethin' like that doesn't tell ya
You set a mark too high when platinum sales are
Looked at as a failure (Yeah)
Then you better take it back to The Shelter and Hamburger Helper
'Cause, damn it, I'm still the

[Chorus]
Greatest in the world, greatest in the world, greatest in the world
No lie, I might be
The best to ever do it, the best to ever do it, the best to ever do it
I feel like the greatest
Woke up to honkies sounding like me
Never be as good, never be as good
Packing up wife-beaters, white t-shirts, white
But I'm the greatest

[Verse 2]
So you sold ten million albums, eh? (What?)
Only problem is, you put out ten million albums, eh? (Haha! Wait)
What was I just about to say?
Oh yeah, let me get this out the way
I know there's people that are pissed about the way
I mispronounced a name, "DIE ANTWOORD!"
Fuck, I still can't say this shit, but how quickly they forget
Who the fuck I was; now Ninja try to duck my slugs
You let ya girl get fucked by Muggs
I'd like to give a shout to Cypress (Woo!)
This can't be real, you dissed me and I was just tryin' to
Give you a shoutnow get the fuck out my rhyme book
No more shiners, already too much time took
And rappers I hear you talkin' shit
I'm just too big to respond to it
God forbid I forget, go and jump out the window
Somebody better child-proof it
'Cause if I lose it we can rewind to some old Ja Rule shit
And I can remind motherfuckers how I do shit
You don't got the tools I got in my toolkit (Bitch!)
I bullshit you not, y'all fools just forgot
That I'm so fuckin' awful with the thoughts
And when I'm hostile and impossible to stop
So you can call it a nostril 'cause it's not gonna ever
I'll never let up on the pedal, might as well get the mop
'Cause I'm wipin' up everyone in this genre
'Cause on the mic I feel like I'm the

[Chorus]
Greatest in the world, greatest in the world, greatest in the world
No lie, I might be
The best to ever do it, the best to ever do it, the best to ever do it
I feel like the greatest
Woke up to honkies sounding like me
Never be as good, never be as good
Packing up wife-beaters, white t-shirts, white
But I'm the greatest

[Verse 3]
Oh yeah, and one more thing I want to mention (What?)
Is you're one dimension
I'm a monkey wrench and I can flunk detention
And I love contentions, so welcome to the gun convention
Muscles flexin', gotta strut like a front suspension
And you just stuck the key up in the ignition
And gave me enough gas to flood my engine (Yeah)
Psychopath, Michael Jack's blowin' up like a raft
I should slap Vlad with a ISIS flag
Bet you I come back twice as bad (Uh)
Revival didn't go viral!
Denaun and Royce tell me that I should take the high road
Fuck that, I'm finna hit back
'Til I run out of gunpowder and split the scene
Hold the mic similar to pistol, squeeze
And I shoot from the hip when I grip them things
And my lips are the clips, got the sig lit like it's nicotine
Trigger me and Slim gets mean (Brr!)
Bars are like bullets when I spit them schemes
That's why I call the motherfuckers M16s (Woo!)
Float like a butterfly, I'm gonna sting like a bee
You ain't harmin' a thing
I hit a ding hard as I'm gonna swing
I'm gonna need to put my arm in a sling
But like a wedding band
You gotta be diamond to even climb in the ring
Anomaly, I'm Muhammad Ali
'Cause I knew one day (Hey!) I'm gonna be the

[Chorus]
Greatest in the world, greatest in the world, greatest in the world
No lie, I might be
The best to ever do it, the best to ever do it, the best to ever do it
I feel like the greatest
Woke up to honkies sounding like me
Never be as good, never be as good
Packing up wife-beaters, white t-shirts, white
But I'm the greatest[Intro]
Yeah, it's my life
In my own words, I guess

[Verse 1]
Have you ever loved someone so much, you'd give an arm for?
Not the expression, no, literally give an arm for
When they know they're your heart and you know you are their armor
And you will destroy anyone who would try to harm her
But what happens when karma turns right around to bite you?
And everything you stand for turns on you to spite you?
What happens when you become the main source of her pain?
"Daddy, look what I made!" "Dad's gotta go catch a plane"
"Daddy, where's Mommy? I can't find Mommy, where is she?"
"I don't know, go play, Hailie, baby, your daddy's busy
Daddy's writin' a song, this song ain't gon' write itself
I'll give you one underdog, then you gotta swing by yourself"
Then turn right around on that song and tell her you love her
And put hands on her mother who's a spitting image of her
That's Slim Shady, yeah, baby, Slim Shady's crazy
Shady made me, but tonight Shady's rock-a-bye baby

[Chorus]
And when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn, rejoice
Every time you hear the sound of my voice, just know that
I'm lookin' down on you smilin' and I didn't feel a thing
So, baby, don't feel my pain, just smile back
And when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn, rejoice
Every time you hear the sound of my voice, just know that
I'm lookin' down on you smilin' and I didn't feel a thing
So, baby, don't feel my pain, just smile back

[Verse 2]
I keep havin' this dream, I'm pushin' Hailie on the swing
She keeps screamin' she don't want me to sing
"You're makin' Mommy cry, why? Why is Mommy cryin'?"
"Baby, Daddy ain't leavin' no more" "Daddy, you're lyin'!
You always say that, you always say this is the last time
But you ain't leavin' no more, Daddy, you're mine!"
She's pilin' boxes in front of the door, tryna block it
"Daddy, please! Daddy, don't leave! Daddy, no, stop it!"
Goes in her pocket, pulls out a tiny necklace locket
It's got a picture, "This'll keep you safe, Daddy, take it with ya!"
I look up, it's just me standin' in the mirror
These fuckin' walls must be talkin', 'cause man, I can hear 'em
They're sayin', "You got one more chance to do right and it's tonight
Now go out there and show 'em that you love 'em 'fore it's too late!"
And just as I go to walk out of my bedroom door
It turns to a stage, they're gone and this spotlight is on and I'm singin'

[Chorus]
And when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn, rejoice
Every time you hear the sound of my voice, just know that
I'm lookin' down on you smilin' and I didn't feel a thing
So, baby, don't feel my pain, just smile back
And when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn, rejoice
Every time you hear the sound of my voice, just know that
I'm lookin' down on you smilin' and I didn't feel a thing
So, baby, don't feel my pain, just smile back

[Verse 3]
60,000 people all jumpin' out their seat
The curtain closes, they're throwin' roses at my feet
I take a bow, and thank you all for comin' out
They're screamin' so loud, I take one last look at the crowd
I glance down, I don't believe what I'm seein'
"Daddy, it's me! Help Mommy, her wrists are bleedin'!"
But baby, we're in Sweden, how did you get to Sweden?
"I followed you, Daddy, you told me that you weren't leavin'
You lied to me, Dad, and now you made Mommy sad
And I bought you this coin, it says 'Number One Dad'
That's all I wanted, I just wanna give you this coin
I get the point, fine, me and Mommy are goin'."
But baby, wait!  "It's too late, Dad, you made the choice
Now go up there and show 'em that you love 'em more than us
That's what they want, they want you, Marshall, they keep
Screamin' your name, it's no wonder you can't go to sleep
Just take another pill, yeah, I bet you you will
You rap about it, yeah, word, k-keep it real."
I hear applause, all this time I couldn't see
How could it be that the curtain is closin' on me?
I turn around, find a gun on the ground, cock it
Put it to my brain, scream, "Die, Shady!" and pop it
The sky darkens, my life flashes, the plane that I was
Supposed to be on crashes and burns to ashes
That's when I wake up, alarm clock's ringin', there's birds singin'
It's spring and Hailie's outside swingin'
I walk right up to Kim and kiss her, tell her I miss her
Hailie just smiles, and winks at her little sister, almost as if to say

[Chorus]
And when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn, rejoice
Every time you hear the sound of my voice, just know that
I'm lookin' down on you smilin' and I didn't feel a thing
So, baby, don't feel my pain, just smile back
And when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn, rejoice
Every time you hear the sound of my voice, just know that
I'm lookin' down on you smilin' and I didn't feel a thing
So, baby, don't feel my pain, just smile back

[Verse 1: Eminem]
Something's burnin', I can't figure out what (out what)
It's either lust or a cloud of dust
Judgement is clouded; must
Just be the powder from the power of (love)
But I'm in something I don't know how to get out of
Left my girl in the house alone
Is that my soon-to-be-spouses moan?
And the further I walk, the louder
Pause for a minute to make certain that's what I heard
Cause after all, this is her place
So I give her the benefit of the doubt, I
Think I might be about to bust her, bust her
The thought's scary, yo, though and it hurtsbrace!
Hope it ain't, "Here we go, yo!"
Cause my head already goes to worst-case
Scenario, though in the first place
But you confirmed my low-end theory though
Should've known when I made it all the way to third base
And that was only the first date
Could've made it to home plate
But you slid straight for the dome and dove face first
"No, (*slurp*) you don't (*slurp*) under (*slurp*) stand, (*slurp*)
I (*slurp*) don't (*slurp*) do this for (*hic*) anyone, (*hic*) ever (*slurp*)."
Yeah, that ain't what they all say?
I'll say, you can suck a softball through a straw
Used to be my fianc
'Til you sucked on Wayne, Andr, and Kanye
LeBron, Akon, Jay, Lil Jon, Raekwon, Ma$e
Polow da Don, Dre, Dante Ross, James Conway, Kwam
Guess I'm gettin' my g-goddang Jigga on, eh?
Cause your name, I'm beyond sayin'
But fuck it, I'm movin' on, you women are all cray
But I'll probably always keep on playin' the

Game of love, love, love, love
La-la-la-la-la love

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
She doesn't love me, no, she don't love me no more
She hates my company, guess she don't love me no more
I tried to get her up out of my head, left my bags at the door
She screamed she loved me like she never did before
And I told her, "Go where you wanna!
Go do whatcha wanna do, I don't care!"
And I told her, "Go where you wanna!
Go do whatcha wanna do, I don't care!"

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
I told that bitch, "I'm a sucker for love, you a sucker for dick."
Suckin' dick in your mama tub, then your granny walked in
Told the stupid nigga to duck under the water
He drowned, like an abortion
They booked you for manslaughter
You beat the case and I called ya
"Sherane is not available now, leave a message at the tone
And Kendrick, don't forget to buy two pair of those
Expensive heels, you little fuckin' Ferris wheel
Fuckin' spinnin' on mefuck you think, we gon' get married still?
Fuckin' Mary had a little lamb, this ain't no fairy tale
Fairy godmama better tell you how I fuckin' feel
Like you should fuckin' beat it
Or fuckin' eat it while I'm on my period
Now have a blessed day." (*Phone hangs up*) Bitch, you serious?
I'm in the mirror with this look on my face, curious
Why you ain't fuckin' with me, you cut me deep as Caesarean
You know I want you bad as a Benjamin, I'm delirious
I want you bad as the head shattered on George Zimmerman
After the Dillinger hit him diligently and killin' him
His mouthpiece for a Cadillac emblem
That's analogy and metaphor for you
I should win a medal for all the ways I adore you
This is me talkin' cordial, yeah, I got some home training
That ain't what you like, ain't it?
What about if I was as famous as Marshall?
Would you give fellatio in the carpool?
Cops pull us over, they just wanna know if you gargle
Singin', "I hope she's good enough
Meanwhile you're chasin' her"
Chlamydia couldn't even get rid of her
Pity the fool and pity the fool in me, I'ma live with the

(She doesn't love me, no, she don't love me no more)
(She hates my company, guess she don't love me no more)
I tried to get her up out of my head, left my bags at the door
She screamed she loved me like she never did before
And I told her, "Go where you wanna!
Go do whatcha wanna do, I don't care!"
And I told her, "Go where you wanna!
Go do whatcha wanna do, I don't care!"

[Verse 3: Eminem]
So needless to say I'm feelin' betrayed
Snatch my house key off her key chain
She jumps off Wee-Bey from The Wire's dick
Now she's chasin' me with a cheese grater
Here goes that broken record clich
It's all my fault anyway, she's turnin' the tables, I'm a beat-break
She treats my face like Serato, she cuts and scratches like a DJ
Each day is an Instant Replay
They say what we display is symptomatic of addict behavior
Back together, but forgot today was her B-day
She cut me off on the freeway
Simple misunderstanding, but just as I went to slam on the brakes
That's when I realized that she may be crazy as me, wait
Bitch cut my fuckin' brakeline
Stepped on them fuckers eight times
Still goin' 73, thank God there's an exit comin' up
What the mother-F-U-C-K's wrong with her?
Hit the off ramp 'til I coasted to a goshdamn halt
Hit a fuckin' tree, now here she comes at full speed
She's racin' at me, okay, you wanna fuck with me, eh?
Snatch that bitch out her car through the window
She screamin', I body slam her on the cement
Until the concrete gave and created a sinkhole
Buried the stink ho in it, then paid to have the street repaved
(The fuck?) Woke up in a dream state
In a cold sweat like I got hit with a freeze ray during a heat wave
Guess I eventually caved though, cause she's layin' next to me in beddirectly aimin' a gat at my head!
Woke up again and jumped up
Like, "Fuck it! I've had it, I'm checkin' into rehab."
I confess I'm a static addict, I guess that's why I'm so clingy
Every girl I've ever had either says I got too much baggage
Or I'm too fuckin' dramatic
Man, what the fuck is the matter? I'm just a fuckin' romantic
I fuckin' love you, you fuckin' bitch!
Combative, possessive, in fact last time I was mad at an ex
I actually set off a chain reaction of tragic events
I said, "Hit the road", then after she left
I sent that bitch a text that said, "Be careful driving
Don't read this and have an accident"
She glanced to look at it and wrecked (*Car crashes*)
Too bad, thought we had a connect
No sense dwelling makes, never been a more compelling case
Than the model covered in L'Oral and mace
Who fell from grace 11 stories for storytellin'
While the whore was yellin', "Rape!"
'Til her vocal cords were swellin'
And her voice were more hoarser than Tori Spellings' face
Still they swarm the gates of my fancy estates
To greet Norman Bates with a warm embrace
'Less you're Andrea Yates, don't ask me for a date though
You're late, well, the sentiment's great
But wait, think there's been a mistake
You wanted an intimate date, I wanna intimidate
I have infinite hate in my blood
It's mainly 'cause of the game of (*Message sound*)
Wait, "dinner at eight"? I have infinite hate in my blood
It's mainly 'cause of the

[Chorus: Eminem]
Hi, my name is, what? My name is, who?
My name is, chka-chka, Slim Shady
Hi, my name is, huh? My name is, what?
My name is, chka-chka, Slim Shady
Hi, my name is, what? (Excuse me) My name is, who?
My name is, chka-chka, Slim Shady
(Can I have the attention of the class for one second?)
Hi, my name is, huh? My name is, what?
My name is, chka-chka, Slim Shady

[Verse 1: Eminem & Dr. Dre]
Hi, kids, do you like violence? (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Wanna see me stick nine-inch nails through each one of my eyelids? (Uh-huh)
Wanna copy me and do exactly like I did? (Yeah, yeah)
Try 'cid and get fucked up worse than my life is? (Huh?)
My brain's dead weight, I'm tryna get my head straight
But I can't figure out which Spice Girl I want to impregnate (Oh)
And Dr. Dre said, "Slim Shady, you a basehead" (Uh-uh)
"Then why's your face red? Man, you wasted"
Well, since age 12, I felt like I'm someone else
'Cause I hung my original self from the top bunk with a belt
Got pissed off and ripped Pamela Lee's tits off
And smacked her so hard I knocked her clothes backwards like Kris Kross
I smoke a fat pound of grass, and fall on my ass
Faster than a fat bitch who sat down too fast
Come here, slut; "Shady, wait a minute, that's my girl, dawg"
I don't give a fuck, God sent me to piss the world off

[Chorus: Eminem]
Hi, my name is, what? My name is, who?
My name is, chka-chka, Slim Shady
Hi, my name is, huh? My name is, what?
My name is, chka-chka, Slim Shady
Hi, my name is, what? My name is, who?
My name is, chka-chka, Slim Shady
Hi, my name is, huh? My name is, what?
My name is, chka-chka, Slim Shady

[Verse 2: Eminem]
My English teacher wanted to flunk me in junior high (Shh)
Thanks a lot, next semester I'll be 35
I smacked him in his face with an eraser, chased him with a stapler
And stapled his nuts to a stack of paper (Ow)
Walked in the strip club, had my jacket zipped up
Flashed the bartender, then stuck my dick in the tip cup
Extraterrestrial, running over pedestrians in a spaceship While they're screaming at me, "Let's just be friends"
99 percent of my life, I was lied to
I just found out my mom does more dope than I do (Damn)
I told her I'd grow up to be a famous rapper
Make a record about doin' drugs and name it after her
(Oh, thank you)
You know you blew up when the women rush your stands
And try to touch your hands like some screamin' Usher fans
(Ahh, ahh, ahh)
This guy at White Castle asked for my autograph (Dude, can I get your autograph?)
So I signed it, "Dear Dave, thanks for the support, asshole"

[Chorus: Eminem]
Hi, my name is, huh? My name is, who?
My name is, chka-chka, Slim Shady
Hi, my name is, what? My name is, who?
My name is, chka-chka, Slim Shady
Hi, my name is, huh? My name is, who?
My name is, chka-chka, Slim Shady
Hi, my name is, what? My name is, who?
My name is, chka-chka, Slim Shady

[Verse 3: Eminem]
Stop the tape, this kid needs to be locked away (Get him)
Dr. Dre, don't just stand there, operate
I'm not ready to leave, it's too scary to die (Fuck that)
I'll have to be carried inside the cemetery and buried alive
(Huh, yup)
Am I comin' or goin'? I can barely decide
I just drank a fifth of vodka, dare me to drive? (Go ahead)
All my life I was very deprived
I ain't had a woman in years and my palms are too hairy to hide (Whoops)
Clothes ripped like the Incredible Hulk
I spit when I talk, I'll fuck anything that walks (Come here)
When I was little, I used to get so hungry I would throw fits
How you gonna breastfeed me, Mom? You ain't got no tits
I lay awake and strap myself in the bed
With a bulletproof vest on and shoot myself in the head (Bang)
'Cause I'm steamin' mad (Grr)
And by the way, when you see my dad (Yeah?)
Tell him that I slit his throat in this dream I had

[Chorus: Eminem]
Hi, my name is, what? My name is, who?
My name is, chka-chka, Slim Shady
Hi, my name is, huh? My name is, what?
My name is, chka-chka, Slim Shady
Hi, my name is, who? My name is, huh?
My name is, chka-chka, Slim Shady
Hi, my name is, huh? My name is, who?
My name is, chka-chka, Slim Shady[Intro]
Where's my snare?
I have no snare in my headphones
There you go, yeah, yo, yo

[Verse 1]
Have you ever been hated or discriminated against?
I have, I've been protested and demonstrated against
Picket signs for my wicked rhymes, look at the times
Sick is the mind of the motherfuckin' kid that's behind
All this commotion, emotions run deep as oceans, explodin'
Tempers flarin' from parents, just blow 'em off and keep goin'
Not takin' nothin' from no one, give 'em hell long as I'm breathin'
Keep kickin' ass in the morning and takin' names in the evenin'
Leave 'em with a taste as sour as vinegar in they mouth
See, they can trigger me, but they'll never figure me out
Look at me now! I bet you're prob'ly sick of me now
Ain't you, Mama? I'ma make you look so ridiculous now!

[Chorus]
I'm sorry, Mama
I never meant to hurt you
I never meant to make you cry
But tonight I'm cleanin' out my closet (One more time!)
I said I'm sorry, Mama
I never meant to hurt you
I never meant to make you cry
But tonight I'm cleanin' out my closet (Ha!)

[Verse 2]
I got some skeletons in my closet
And I don't know if no one knows it
So before they throw me inside my coffin and close it
I'ma expose it; I'll take you back to '73
Before I ever had a multi-platinum-selling CD
I was a baby, maybe I was just a couple of months
My faggot father must've had his panties up in a bunch
Cause he split, I wonder if he even kissed me goodbye
No, I don't, on second thought, I just fuckin' wished he would die
I look at Hailie, and I couldn't picture leavin' her side
Even if I hated Kim, I'd grit my teeth and I'd try
To make it work with her at least for Hailie's sake
I maybe made some mistakes
But I'm only human, but I'm man enough to face 'em today
What I did was stupid, no doubt it was dumb
But the smartest shit I did was take the bullets out of that gun
Cause I'da killed 'em, shit, I woulda shot Kim and him both
It's my life, I'd like to welcome y'all to The Eminem Show

[Chorus]
I'm sorry, Mama
I never meant to hurt you
I never meant to make you cry
But tonight I'm cleanin' out my closet (One more time!)
I said I'm sorry, Mama
I never meant to hurt you
I never meant to make you cry
But tonight I'm cleanin' out my closet (Uh)

[Verse 3]
Now, I would never diss my own mama just to get recognition
Take a second to listen 'fore you think this record is dissin'
But put yourself in my position, just try to envision
Witnessin' your mama poppin' prescription pills in the kitchen
Bitchin' that someone's always goin' through her purse and shit's missin'
Goin' through public housing systems
Victim of Mnchausen's Syndrome
My whole life I was made to believe I was sick when I wasn't
'Til I grew up, now I blew up
It makes you sick to your stomach, doesn't it?
Wasn't it the reason you made that CD for me, Ma?
So you could try to justify the way you treated me, Ma?
But guess what, you're gettin' older now
And it's cold when you're lonely
And Nathan's growin' up so quick
He's gonna know that you're phony
And Hailie's gettin' so big now, you should see her, she's beautiful
But you'll never see hershe won't even be at your funeral (ha-ha!)
See, what hurts me the most is you won't admit you was wrong
Bitch, do your song, keep tellin' yourself that you was a mom!
But how dare you try to take what you didn't help me to get?!
You selfish bitch, I hope you fuckin' burn in hell for this shit!
Remember when Ronnie died and you said you wished it was me?
Well, guess what, I am deaddead to you as can be!

[Chorus]
I'm sorry, Mama
I never meant to hurt you
I never meant to make you cry
But tonight I'm cleanin' out my closet (One more time!)
I said I'm sorry, Mama
I never meant to hurt you
I never meant to make you cry
But tonight I'm cleanin' out my closet[Intro: Polina]
Tell me where to go
Tell me what to do
I'll be right there for you
Tell me what to say
No matter if it's true
I'll say it all for you

[Verse 1: Eminem]
I used to be the type of kid
That would always think the sky is fallin'
Why am I so differently wired? Am I a martian?
What kind of twisted experiment am I involved in?
Cause I don't belong in this world
That's why I'm scoffin' at authority, defiant often
Flyin' off at the handle at my mom
No dad, so I am noncompliant at home
At school I'm just shy and awkward
And I don't need no goddamn psychologist
Tryna diagnose why I have all these underlyin' problems
Thinkin' he can try and solve 'em
I'm outside chalkin' up drawings
On the sidewalk and in the front drive talkin'
To myself, either that or inside hidin' off in
The corner somewhere quiet, tryin' not to
Be noticed cause I'm cryin' and sobbin'
I had a bad day at school so I ain't talkin'
Some cocksucker shoved me into a fuckin' locker
Cause he said that I eye-balled him

[Pre-Chorus: Polina]
And if you fall, I'll get you there
I'll be your savior from all the wars
That are fought inside your world
Please have faith in my words

[Chorus: Polina]
Cause this is my legacy, legacy, yeah
This is my legacy, legacy, yeah
There's no guarantee
It's not up to me, we can only see
This is my legacy, legacy, legacy, legacy

[Verse 2: Eminem]
I used to be the type of kid that would always think the sky's fallin'
Why am I so differently wired in my noggin?
Cause sporadic as my thoughts come, it's mind-bogglin'
Cause I obsess on everything in my mind, small shit
Bothers me, but not my father, he said sayonara
Then split, but I dont give a shit
I'm fine long as there's batteries in my Walkman
Nothing is the matter with me
Shit, look on the bright side, at least I ain't walkin'
I bike ride through the neighborhood of my apartment
Complex on a ten-speed which I've acquired parts that
I find in the garbage, a frame then put tires on it
Headphones on, look straight ahead if kids try and start shit
But if this is all there is for me life offers
Why bother even tryin' to put up a fight? It's nonsense
But I think a light bulb just lit up in my conscience
What about them rhymes I've been jottin'?
They are kind of giving me confidence
Instead of tryin' to escape through my comics
Why don't I just blast a little something like Onyx?
To put me in the mood to wanna fight and write songs that
Say what I wanna say to the kid that said that I eye-balled him
Grab hold of my balls, like, "That's right, fight's on, bitch!"
Who woulda knew, from the moment I turned the mic on, that
I could be iconic in my conquest?
That's word to Phife Dawg from A Tribe Called Quest

[Chorus: Polina]
This is my legacy, legacy, yeah
This is my legacy, legacy, yeah
There's no guarantee
It's not up to me, we can only see
This is my legacy, legacy, legacy, legacy

[Verse 3: Eminem]
I used to be the type of kid that would always think the sky's fallin'
Now I think the fact that I'm differently wired's awesome
Cause if I wasn't, I wouldn't be able to work words like this
And connect lines like crosswords
And use my enemy's words as strength
To try and draw from, and get inspired off 'em
Cause all my life I was told and taught I am not shit
By you wack fuckin' giant sacks of lyin' dog shit
Now you shut up, bitch, I am talkin'
Thought I was full of horseshit
And now you fuckin' worship the ground on which I am walkin'
Me against the world, so what? I'm Brian Dawkins
Versus the whole 0-16 Lions offense
So bring on the Giants, Falcons, and Miami Dolphins
It's the body bag game, bitch, I'm supplyin' coffins
Cause you dicks butt kiss, bunch of Brian Baldingers
You're gon' die a ball-licker, I've been diabolical
With this dialogue since '99 Rawkus
You don't respect the legacy I leave behind, y'all can
Suck a dick; the day you beat me, pigs'll fly out my ass
In a flyin' saucer full of Italian sausage
The most high exaltin' and I ain't haltin'
'Til I die of exhaustion, inhale my exhaust fumes
The best part about me is I am not you
I'm me, and I'm the Fire Marshall, and this is my

[Chorus: Polina]
This is my legacy, legacy, yeah
This is my legacy, legacy, yeah
There's no guarantee
It's not up to me, we can only see
This is my legacy, legacy, legacy, legacy[Segue from "Steve Berman (Skit)"]
...Man, whatever

[Intro]
Dre, just let it run
Ayo, turn the beat up a little bit
Ayo
This song is for anyone...
Fuck it, just shut up and listen
Ayo

[Verse 1]
I sit back with this pack of Zig-Zag's and this bag
Of this weed, it gives me the shit needed to be
The most meanest MC on this... on this Earth
And since birth I've been cursed with this curse to just curse
And just blurt this berserk and bizarre shit that works
And it sells and it helps in itself to relieve
All this tension, dispensin' these sentences
Gettin' this stress that's been eatin' me recently off
Of this chest and I rest again peacefully (Peacefully)
But at least have the decency in you
To leave me alone, when you freaks see me out
In the streets when I'm eatin' or feedin' my daughter
To not come and speak to me (Speak to me), I don't know you
And no, I don't owe you a motherfuckin' thing
I'm not Mr. N'Sync, I'm not what your friends think
I'm not Mr. Friendly, I can be a prick
If you tempt me, my tank is on empty (Is on empty)
No patience is in me and if you offend me
I'm liftin' you ten feet (Liftin' you ten feet) in the air
I don't care who was there and who saw me just jaw you
Go call you a lawyer, file you a lawsuit
I'll smile in the courtroom and buy you a wardrobe
I'm tired of all you (Of all you), I don't mean to be mean
But that's all I can be, it's just me

[Chorus]
And I am whatever you say I am
If I wasn't, then why would I say I am?
In the paper, the news, every day I am
Radio won't even play my jam
'Cause I am whatever you say I am
If I wasn't, then why would I say I am?
In the paper, the news, every day I am
I don't know, that's just the way I am

[Verse 2]
Sometimes I just feel like my father, I hate to be bothered
With all of this nonsense, it's constant
And, "Oh, it's his lyrical content
The song 'Guilty Conscience' has gotten such rotten responses."
And all of this controversy circles me
And it seems like the media immediately
Points a finger at me (Finger at me)
So I point one back at 'em, but not the index or pinkie
Or the ring or the thumb, it's the one you put up
When you don't give a fuck, when you won't just put up
With the bullshit they pull, 'cause they full of shit too
When a dude's gettin' bullied and shoots up his school
And they blame it on Marilyn (On Marilyn) and the heroin
Where were the parents at? And look where it's at!
Middle America, now it's a tragedy
Now it's so sad to see, an upper-class city
Havin' this happenin' (This happenin') then attack
Eminem 'cause I rap this way (Rap this way) but I'm glad
'Cause they feed me the fuel that I need for the fire to burn
And it's burnin', and I have returned

[Chorus]
And I am whatever you say I am
If I wasn't, then why would I say I am?
In the paper, the news, every day I am
Radio won't even play my jam
'Cause I am whatever you say I am
If I wasn't, then why would I say I am?
In the paper, the news, every day I am
I don't know, that's just the way I am

[Verse 3]
I'm so sick and tired of bein' admired
That I wish that I would just die or get fired
And dropped from my label, let's stop with the fables
I'm not gonna be able to top a "My Name Is"
And pigeon-holed into some poppy sensation
To cop me rotation at rock 'n' roll stations
And I just do not got the patience (Got the patience)
To deal with these cocky Caucasians
Who think I'm some wigger who just tries to be black 'cause I talk
With an accent and grab on my balls so they always
Keep askin' the same fuckin' questions (Fuckin' questions)
What school did I go to, what hood I grew up in
The why, the who, what, when, the where and the how
'Til I'm grabbin' my hair and I'm tearin' it out
'Cause they drivin' me crazy (Drivin' me crazy), I can't take it
I'm racin', I'm pacin', I stand and I sit
And I'm thankful for every fan that I get
But I can't take a shit in the bathroom without
Someone standin' by it! (Standin' by it) No, I won't sign your autograph
You can call me an asshole, I'm glad

[Chorus]
'Cause I am whatever you say I am
If I wasn't, then why would I say I am?
In the paper, the news, every day I am
Radio won't even play my jam
'Cause I am whatever you say I am
If I wasn't, then why would I say I am?
In the paper, the news, every day I am
I don't know, that's just the way I am

[Produced by Eminem][Verse 1: Eminem]
We touch, I feel a rush; we clutch, it isn't much
But it's enough to make me wonder what's in store for us
It's lust, it's torturous, you must be a sorceress
'Cause you just did the impossible: gained my trust
Don't play games, it'll be dangerous
If you fuck me over, cause if I get burnt, I'ma show ya
What it's like to hurt, cause I been treated like dirt before ya
And love is evil  spell it backwards, I'll show ya
Nobody knows me, I'm cold, walk down this road all alone
It's no one's fault but my own, it's the path I've chosen to go
Frozen as snow, I show no emotion whatsoever so
Don't ask me why I have no love for these muh'fuckin' hoes
Bloodsuckin' succubuses, what the fuck is up with this?
I've tried in this department, but I ain't had no luck with this
It sucks, but it's exactly what I thought it would be like
Tryin' to start over, I got a hole in my heart
But some kind of emotional roller coaster
Is something I won't go on
So you toy with my emotions, so it's over
It's like an explosion every time I hold ya
Wasn't joking when I told ya
You take my breath away, you're a supernova, and I'm a

[Chorus: Steve McEwan]
I'm a space-bound rocket ship and your heart's the Moon
And I'm aimin' right at you, right at you
250,000 miles on a clear night in June
And I'm aimin' right at you
Right at you, right at you

[Verse 2: Eminem]
I'll do whatever it takes, when I'm with you, I get the shakes
My body aches when I ain't with you, I have zero strength
There's no limit on how far I would go, no boundaries, no lengths
Why do we say that until we get that person that we think's
Gonna be that one? And then once we get 'em, it's never the same
You want 'em when they don't want you
Soon as they do, feelings change
It's not a contest and I ain't on no conquest for no mate
I wasn't lookin' when I stumbled on to you, musta been fate
But so much is at stake, what the fuck does it take?
Let's cut to the chase 'fore the door shuts in your face
Promise me if I cave in and break and leave myself open
That I won't be makin' a mistake, cause I'm a

[Chorus: Steve McEwan]
I'm a space-bound rocket ship and your heart's the Moon
And I'm aimin' right at you, right at you
250,000 miles on a clear night in June
And I'm aimin' right at you
Right at you, right at you

[Verse 3: Eminem]
So, after a year and six months, it's no longer me that you want
But I love you so much it hurts, never mistreated you once
I poured my heart out to you, let down my guard, swear to God
I blow my brains in your lap, lay here and die in your arms
Drop to my knees and I'm pleadin', I'm tryna stop you from leavin'
You won't even listen, so fuck it, I'm tryna stop you from breathin'
I put both hands on your throat, I sit on top of you squeezin'
'Til I snap your neck like a Popsicle stick, ain't no possible reason
I can think of to let you walk up out this house and let you live
Tears stream down both of my cheeks
Now I let you go and just give
And 'fore I put that gun to my temple, I told you this

[Bridge: Eminem]
And I would've done anything for you
To show you how much I adored you
But it's over now, it's too late to save our love
Just promise me you'll think of me
Every time you look up in the sky and see a star, cause I'm a

[Chorus: Steve McEwan]
I'm a space-bound rocket ship and your heart's the Moon
And I'm aimin' right at you, right at you
250,000 miles on a clear night in June
And I'm so lost without you
Without you, without you[Hook]
Step by step, heart to heart
Left, right, left, we all fall down
Step by step, heart to heart
Left, right, left, we all fall down
Like toy soldiers
Bit by bit, torn apart
We never win, but the battle wages on
For toy soldiers

[Verse 1]
I'm supposed to be the soldier who never blows his composure
Even though I hold the weight of the whole world on my shoulders
I ain't never supposed to show it, my crew ain't supposed to know it
Even if it means goin' toe-to-toe with a Benzino
It don't matter, I never drag 'em in battles that I can't handle
'Less I absolutely have to, I'm supposed to set an example
I need to be the leader, my crew looks for me to guide 'em
If some shit ever does pop off, I'm supposed to be beside 'em
That Ja shit, I tried to squash it, it was too late to stop it
There's a certain line you just don't cross, and he crossed it
I heard him say Hailie's name on a song and I just lost it
It was crazy, the shit went way beyond some JAY-Z and Nas shit
And even though the battle was won, I feel like we lost it
I spent so much energy on it, honestly I'm exhausted
And I'm so caught in it that I almost feel I'm the one who caused it
This ain't what I'm in hip-hop for, that's not why I got in it
That was never my object, for someone to get killed
Why would I wanna destroy something I helped build?
That wasn't my intentions, my intentions were good
I went through my whole career without ever mentionin' ****
And that was just outta respect, for not runnin' my mouth
And talkin' about somethin' that I knew nothin' about
Plus Dre told me stay out, this just wasn't my beef
So I did, I just fell back, watched and gritted my teeth
While he's all over TV, down-talkin' the man
Who literally saved my life, like fuck it, I understand
This is business, and this shit just isn't none of my business
But still knowin' the shit could pop off at any minute, cause

[Hook]
Step by step, heart to heart
Left, right, left, we all fall down
Like toy soldiers
Bit by bit, torn apart
We never win, but the battle wages on
For toy soldiers

[Verse 2]
There used to be a time when you could just say a rhyme and
Wouldn't have to worry about one of your people dyin'
But now it's elevated, cause once you put someone's kids in it
The shit gets escalated  it ain't just words no more, is it?
It's a different ballgame, you call names and you ain't just rappin'
We actually tried to stop the 50 and Ja beef from happenin'
Me and Dre had sat with him, kicked it and had a chat with him
And asked him not to start it, he wasn't gonna go after him
Until Ja started yappin' in magazines how he stabbed him
Fuck it, 50, smash him! Mash on him, let him have it
Meanwhile my attention's pulled in another direction
Some receptionist at The Source who answers phones at his desk
Has an erection for me and thinks that I'll be his resurrection
Tries to blow the dust off his mic and make a new record
But now he's fucked the game up 'cause one of the ways I came up
Was through that publication, the same one that made me famous
Now the owner of it has got a grudge against me for nothin'?
Well, fuck it, that motherfucker could get it too, fuck him then!
But I'm so busy bein' pissed off, I don't stop to think
That we just inherited 50's beef with Murder Inc.
And he's inherited mine, which is fine, ain't like either of us mind
But we still have soldiers that's on the front line
Who's willin' to die for us as soon as we give the orders
Never to extort us, strictly to show they support us
And maybe shout 'em out in a rap or up in a chorus
To show 'em we love 'em back and let 'em know how important it is
To have Runyon Avenue soldiers up in our corners
Their loyalty to us is worth more than any award is
But I ain't tryna have none of my people hurt or murdered
It ain't worth it, I can't think of a perfecter way to word it
Than to just say that I love y'all too much to see the verdict
I'll walk away from it all 'fore I let it go any further
But don't get it twisted, it's not a plea that I'm coppin'
I'm just willin' to be the bigger man, if y'all can quit poppin'
Off at the jaws, well, then I can, cause frankly I'm sick of talkin'
I'm not gonna let someone else's coffin rest on my conscience cause

[Hook]
Step by step, heart to heart
Left, right, left, we all fall down
Like toy soldiers
Bit by bit, torn apart
We never win, but the battle wages on
For toy soldiers[Bridge: Eminem]
Feels like a close, it's coming to
Fuck am I gonna do?
It's too late to start over
This is the only thing I, thing I know

[Verse 1: Eminem]
Sometimes I feel like all I ever do is
Find different ways to word the same old song
Ever since I came along
From the day the song called Hi! My Name Is dropped
Started thinking my name was Fault
Cause any time things went wrong
I was the one who they would blame it on
The media made me the equivalent
Of a modern-day Genghis Khan
Tried to argue it was only entertainment, dog
Gangster? Nah, courageous balls
Had to change my style, they said I'm way too soft
And I sound like AZ and Nas, out came the claws
And the fangs been out since then
But up until the instant that I went against it
It was ingrained in me
That I wouldn't amount to a shit stain, I thought
No wonder I had to unlearn everything my brain was taught
"Do I really belong in this game?", I pondered
I just wanna play my part
Should I make waves or not?
So back and forth in my brain the tug of war wages on
And I don't wanna seem ungrateful
Or disrespect the art form I was raised upon
But sometimes you gotta take a loss
And have people rub it in your face
Before you get made pissed off
And keep plugging, it's your only outlet
And your only outfit, so you know they gonna talk about it
Better find a way to counter it quick and make it ah
Feel like I've already said this a kabillion 80 times
How many times can I say the same thing
Different ways that rhyme?
What I really wanna say is, if there's anyone else that can relate to my story, bet you feel the same way I felt
When I was in the same place you are, when I was afraid to

[Pre-Chorus: Sia]
I was a afraid to make a single sound
Afraid I would never find a way out, out, out
Afraid I'd never be found
I didn't wanna go another round
An angry man's power will shut you up
Trip wires fill this house with tip-toed love
Run out of excuses for everyone
So here I am and I will not run

[Chorus: Sia]
Guts over fear, the time is near
Guts over fear, might shed a tear
For all the times I let you push me round
I let you keep me down
Now I got guts over fear, guts over fear

[Bridge: Eminem]
Feels like a close, it's coming to
Fuck am I gonna do?
It's too late to start over
This is the only thing I, thing I know

[Verse 2: Eminem]
I know what it was like, I was there once
Single parents, hate your appearance
As you struggle to find your place in this world
And the pain spawns all the anger on
But it wasn't 'til I put the pain in song
Learned who to aim it on that I made a spark
Started to spit harder shit
Learned how to harness it while the reins were off
And there was a lot of bizarre shit, but the crazy part
Was soon as I stopped saying I gave a fuck
Haters started to appreciate my art
And it just breaks my heart to look at all the pain I caused
But what am I gonna do when the rage is gone
And the lights go out in that trailer park
And the window is closing and there's nowhere else that I can go with flows and I'm frozen
Cause there's no more emotion for me to pull from
Just a bunch of playful songs that I make for fun
So, to the break of dawn, here I go recycling the same old song
But I rather make Not Afraid 2
Than make another motherfucking We Made You, ah
Now, I don't wanna seem indulgent
When I discuss my lows and my highs
My demise and my uprise, pray to God
I just open enough eyes later on
And gave you the supplies and the tools
To hopefully use that'll make you strong
Enough to lift yourself up, when you feel like I felt
Cause I can't explain to y'all how dang exhausted my legs felt
Just having to balance my dang self
When on eggshells, I was made to walk
But thank you, Ma, cause that gave me the
Strength to cause Shady-mania, so when they empty that stadium
Least I made it out of that house
And found a place in this world when the day was done
So this is for every kid who all's they ever did
Was dreamt of one day just getting accepted
I represent him or her, anyone similar
You are the reason that I made this song
And everything you're scared to say
Don't be afraid to say no more
From this day forward, just let them a-holes talk
Take it with a grain of saltand eat their fucking faces off!
The legend of the angry blond
Lives on through you when Im gone, and to think I was a

[Pre-Chorus: Sia]
I was a afraid to make a single sound
Afraid I would never find a way out, out, out
Afraid I'd never be found
I didn't wanna go another round
An angry man's power will shut you up
Trip wires fill this house with tip-toed love
Run out of excuses for everyone
So here I am and I will not run

[Chorus: Sia]
Guts over fear, the time is near
Guts over fear, might shed a tear
For all the times I let you push me round
I let you keep me down
Now I got guts over fear, guts over fear[Intro: Eminem & Dina Rae]
Mhmmm *inhales*
You high, baby?
Yeah
Yeah?
Talk to me
You want me to tell you something?
Uh-huh
I know what you wanna hear

[Refrain: Eminem (& Dina Rae)]
'Cause I know you want me, baby, I think I want you too
(I think I love you, baby) I think I love you too
I'm here to save you, girl, come be in Shady's world
I wanna grow together, let's let our love unfurl
You know you want me, baby, you know I want you too
They call me Superman, I'm here to rescue you
I wanna save you, girl, come be in Shady's world
(Oh boy, you drive me crazy) Bitch, you make me hurl

[Verse 1: Eminem]
They call me Superman
Leap tall hoes in a single bound
I'm single now: got no ring on this finger now
I'd never let another chick bring me down
In a relationship; save it, bitch!
Babysit? You make me sick
Superman ain't savin' shit
Girl, you can jump on Shady's dick
Straight from the hip, cut to the chase
I tell a motherfuckin' slut to her face
Play no games, say no names
Ever since I broke up with what's-her-face
I'm a different man, kiss my ass
Kiss my lips? Bitch, why ask?
Kiss my dick, get my cash?
I'd rather have you whip my ass
Don't put out, I'll put you out
Won't get out, I'll push you out
Puss blew out, poppin' shit
Wouldn't piss on fire to put you out
Am I too nice? Buy you ice?
Bitch, if you died, wouldn't buy you life
What, you tryin' to be my new wife?
What, you Mariah? Fly through twice

[Pre-Chorus: Eminem]
But I do know one thing though
Bitches, they come, they go
Saturday through Sunday, Monday
Monday through Sunday, yo
Maybe I'll love you one day
Maybe we'll someday grow
'Til then just sit your drunk ass on that fuckin' runway, ho

[Chorus: Eminem]
Cause I can't be your Superman, can't be your Superman
Can't be your Superman, can't be your Superman
I can't be your Superman, can't be your Superman
Can't be your Superman, your Superman, your Superman

[Verse 2: Eminem]
Don't get me wrong, I love these hoes
It's no secret, everybody knows
Yeah, we fucked: bitch, so what?
That's about as far as your buddy goes
We'll be friends, I'll call you again
I'll chase you around every bar you attend
Never know what kinda car I'll be in
We'll see how much you be'll partyin' then
You don't want that, neither do I
I don't wanna flip when I see you with guys
Too much pride, between you and I
Not a jealous man, but females lie
But I guess that's just what sluts do
How could it ever be just us two?
I'd never love you enough to trust you
We just met and I just fucked you

[Pre-Chorus: Eminem]
But I do know one thing though
Bitches, they come, they go
Saturday through Sunday, Monday
Monday through Sunday, yo
Maybe I'll love you one day
Maybe we'll someday grow
'Til then just sit your drunk ass on that fuckin' runway, ho

[Chorus: Eminem]
Cause I can't be your Superman, can't be your Superman
Can't be your Superman, can't be your Superman
I can't be your Superman, can't be your Superman
Can't be your Superman, your Superman, your Superman
Cause I can't be your Superman, can't be your Superman
Can't be your Superman, can't be your Superman
I can't be your Superman, can't be your Superman
Can't be your Superman, your Superman, your Superman

[Refrain: Eminem (& Dina Rae)]
'Cause I know you want me, baby, I think I want you too

You know you want me, baby, you know I want you too
They call me Superman, I'm here to rescue you
I wanna save you, girl, come be in Shady's world
(Oh boy, you drive me crazy) Bitch, you make me hurl

[Verse 3: Eminem]
First thing you say: I'm not fazed
I hang around big stars all day
I don't see what the big deal is anyway
You're just plain old Marshall to me
Ooh yeah, girl, run that game
Hailie Jade, I love that name
Love that tattoo, what's that say?
"Rot In Pieces," uh, that's great
First off, you don't know Marshall
At all, so don't grow partial
That's ammo for my arsenal
I'll slap you off that bar stool
There goes another lawsuit
Leave handprints all across you
Good Lordy, whoadie
You must be gone off that water bottle
You want what you can't have
Ooh girl, that's too damn bad
Don't touch what you can't grab
End up with two backhands
Put anthrax on a Tampax
And slap you 'til you can't stand
Girl, you just blew your chance
Don't mean to ruin your plans

[Pre-Chorus: Eminem]
But I do know one thing though
Bitches, they come, they go
Saturday through Sunday, Monday
Monday through Sunday, yo
Maybe I'll love you one day
Maybe we'll someday grow
'Til then just sit your drunk ass on that fuckin' runway, ho

[Chorus: Eminem]
Cause I can't be your Superman, can't be your Superman
Can't be your Superman, can't be your Superman
I can't be your Superman, can't be your Superman
Can't be your Superman, your Superman, your Superman
Cause I can't be your Superman, can't be your Superman
Can't be your Superman, can't be your Superman
I can't be your Superman, can't be your Superman
Can't be your Superman, your Superman, your Superman

[Refrain: Eminem (& Dina Rae)]

Cause I can't be your Superman, can't be your Superman
Can't be your Superman, can't be your Superman
I can't be your Superman, can't be your Superman

Cause I can't be your Superman, can't be your Superman
Can't be your Superman, can't be your Superman
I can't be your Superman, can't be your Superman
Can't be your Superman, your Superman, your Superman[Intro: Young M.A & Eminem]
Oh, this what we doin'? Alright
M.A

[Verse 1: Young M.A]
I like a bitch that like to wobble, wobble
Shake it,shakeit, break it,break it, uh
Nigga, we made it,made it, they hate it, hate it
Pro professional, pure persistent, I'm paper chasing
I hate complaining, I hated waiting, I'll pay for patience
But I hate to pay a bill (Hate that)
And I made a mil' without a major deal (I made that)
Yeah, her ass fake, but she came for real (She came, uh)
Money ain't a thing, that ain't a thing for real
It's the broke lingo (Huh)
And no, ain't nothing Saweetie, this is no Quavo (Migo)
Man, I just get high, let my hoes lay low (Ooh)
I just want some face but this is no facial (Ooh)
Do right and kill er'body, Drake mode (Hello)
Bitch, I'm tryna eat out, take your plate mode (Hello)
Disrespect that life and I'm in gang mode (Grrr)
You can leave this earth, bitch, I'm in rake mode (Huh)
I'm in cake mode (Huh), I'm in brave mode, uh
What up, Marshall? I'm a martian, I'm in Wayne mode (Facts)
Neck wet, big drip, I'm in rain mode (Drip, drip, drip)
Eight niggas, eight hittas, take eight souls (Brrr)
Collect pesos (Huh), and I'm paid, so? (Paid)
Self-made goals (Hey)
When the pain leaves (Huh)
Where does the pain go? (Where?)
Tip of the backwood is where the flame goes (There)
To the sky is where my brain goes (Wow)
Same pack, same fiend, sellin' the same clothes (Wow)
Pinocchio and my pistol, they got the same nose
Me and my niggas gotta eat, we share the same stove (What?)
Case closed, bodies in my lane, bitch, lane closed

[Verse 2: Eminem]
Game over, Thanos on you H-O's
On my petty shit but I don't paint toes (Yeah)
Get the plunger (Plunger) 'cause Marshall and M.A go plum crazy
Call us liquid plumber, 'cause even Dre know (Dre know)
Beat knocks like a beefed up Detox
You're gonna need three squads of police officers at least to come pull me off of it and I don't stop
Please, dawg, I need y'all to keep talking shit 'cause I feed off of it
I am the complete opposite of these retards who spit these weak bars, I'ma leave carnage
Each thought'll be so toxic, it'll block the wind through your esophagus
Stop it, cutting off your oxygen
And I hit them pads like a boxing gym
Better watch for Slim, better get to popping and when I'm at the top again
I won't topple, I'm giving it to anyone who wanna come and get it and I'm not gonna stop
But when they ask me is the war finished with MGK? Of course it is
I cleansed him of his mortal sins, I'm God and the Lord forgives even the devil worshippers
I'm moving on but you know your scruples are gone when you're born with Lucifer's horns
And you're from the school of Notorious, Puba, Cube and The Poor Righteous Teachers tutored my students
Showed them all the blueprint and formula
But it seems like the more they studied my music, the more they remind me of eyeballs
I'm watching my pupils get cornier (Uh)
But I'm contemplating yelling "Bombs away" on the game
Like I'm outside of an Ariana Grande concert waiting

[Chorus: Eminem]
They call me Saddam Hussein, Ayatollah Khomeini
Where's Osama been? I been laden lately
Look at how I'm behaving, they want me gone away
They wanna JonBent me (Fuck you), I'm unaccommodating

[Verse 3: Eminem]
Man, I don't see why they hate me (Huh?)
I'm a clown like John Wayne Gacy (What?)
They call me Kanye crazy (Yah)
APESHIT, Beyonce, Jay-Z (Woo)
And I'm back with Andre, baby (Yeah)
And the doctor's operating (What?)
But he never put no scrubs on from Snoop, K. Dot to Shady
Shady like a shadow or your silhouette, intellect, I better check to see why you feel upset
'Cause I met your bitch on the internet now I'm getting head like a Pillow Pet
That bimbo can put her lips all the way around this bone and then blow
Like a dusty cartridge from an old Nintendo
Those were the days but I bet you, I'm never gonna be broke again, no
I don't smoke but I got paper, to be blunt, I'm rolling Indo
And I keep it one comma, zero, zero, zero, zero
Real, real, real, murder, murder, murder, kill, kill, kill
Nickel-plated, twenty two, two, two
Bitch, shut the fuck up 'fore I shoot you too
Ain't shit I won't do just to get a few YouTube views
Run up in a church like pew, pew, pew
'Cause that's what I do, do, do
But, even to the untrained human eye
We ain't the same, you and I
Somebody should have explained to you why
For you to go against me, it's simply insane, you will die (Yeah)
That's why they call me Kamikaze, it's plain suicide, yeah
But I know magic and here go my last trick
I'm 'bout to say "Abracadabra" and pull a B Rabbit up out of my hat
I'm about to relapse and I betcha that you won't know how to react
But a look of disgust, I don't doubt it'd be that
As I begin to fuckin' devour the track
And you backpedal, that is a cowardly act
Like a Saudi attack when the towers collapsed

[Chorus: Eminem]
They call me Saddam Hussein, Ayatollah Khomeini
Where's Osama been? I been laden lately
Look at how I'm behaving, they want me gone away
They wanna JonBent me (Fuck you), I'm unaccommodating[Verse 1: Eminem]
These ideas are nightmares to white parents
Whose worst fear is a child with dyed hair and who likes earrings
Like whatever they say has no bearing
It's so scary in a house that allows no swearing
To see him walkin' around with his headphones blarin'
Alone in his own zone, cold and he don't care, he's
A problem child, and what bothers him all comes out
When he talks about his fuckin' dad walkin' out (Bitch!)
'Cause he hates him so bad that he blocks him out
If he ever saw him again he'd probably knock him out
His thoughts are wacked, he's mad so he's talkin' back
Talkin' black, brainwashed from rock and rap
He sags his pants, do-rags and a stockin' cap
His step-father hit him so he socked him back
And broke his nose, his house is a broken home
There's no control, he just lets his emotions go

[Chorus: Steven Tyler (& Eminem)]
(Come on!) Sing with me (Sing!), sing for the year (Sing it!)
Sing for the laughter and sing for the tear (Come on!)
Sing it with me, it's just for today
Maybe tomorrow the good Lord will take you away

[Verse 2: Eminem]
Entertainment is changin', intertwinin' with gangsters
In the land of the killers a sinner's mind is a sanctum
Holy or unholy, only have one homie
Only this gun, lonely cause don't anyone know me
Yet everybody just feels like they can relate (Huh-uh)
I guess words are a motherfucker, they can be great
Or they can degrade, or even worse, they can teach hate
It's like these kids hang on every single statement we make
Like they worship us, plus all the stores ship us platinum
Now how the fuck did this metamorphosis happen?
From standin' on corners and porches just rappin'
To havin' a fortune, no more kissin' ass
But then these critics crucify you (Yep), journalists try to burn you
Fans turn on you, attorneys all want a turn at you
To get they hands on every dime you have
They want you to lose your mind every time you mad
So they can try to make you out to look like a loose cannon
Any dispute won't hesitate to produce handguns
That's why these prosecutors wanna convict me
Strictly just to get me off of these streets quickly
But all they kids be listenin' to me religiously
So I'm signin' CDs while police fingerprint me
They're for the judge's daughter, but his grudge is against me
If I'm such a fuckin' menace, this shit doesn't make sense, B
It's all political, if my music is literal
And I'm a criminal, how the fuck can I raise a little girl?
I couldn't, I wouldn't be fit to
You're full of shit too, Guerrera, that was a fist that hit you! (Bitch!)

[Chorus: Steven Tyler (& Eminem)]
(Come on!) Sing with me (Sing!), sing for the year (Sing it!)
Sing for the laughter and sing for the tear (Sing that shit!)
Sing it with me, it's just for today
Maybe tomorrow the good Lord will take you away

[Verse 3: Eminem]
They say music can alter moods and talk to you
Well, can it load a gun up for you and cock it too?
Well, if it can, then the next time you assault a dude
Just tell the judge it was my fault and I'll get sued
See, what these kids do is hear about us totin' pistols
And they wanna get one cause they think the shit's cool
Not knowin' we really just protectin' ourselves
We entertainers, of course the shit's affectin' our sales
You ignoramus, but music is reflection of self
We just explain it, and then we get our checks in the mail
It's fucked up, ain't it? How we can come from practically nothin'
To bein' able to have any fuckin' thing that we wanted
That's why we sing for these kids who don't have a thing
Except for a dream and a fuckin' rap magazine (Ha-ha!)
Who post pin-up pictures on they walls all day long
Idolize they favorite rappers and know all they songs
Or for anyone who's ever been through shit in they lives
So they sit and they cry at night, wishin' they'd die
'Til they throw on a rap record and they sit and they vibe
We're nothin' to you, but we're the fuckin' shit in they eyes
That's why we seize the moment, try to freeze it and own it
Squeeze it and hold it cause we consider these minutes golden
And maybe they'll admit it when we're gone, just let our spirits
Live on through our lyrics that you hear in our songs, and we can

[Chorus: Steven Tyler (& Eminem)]
Sing with me (Sing!), sing for the year (Sing it!)
Sing for the laughter and sing for the tear (Come on!)
Sing it with me, it's just for today
Maybe tomorrow the good Lord will take you away

[Chorus: Steven Tyler (& Eminem)]
Sing with me (Sing!), sing for the year (Sing it!)
Sing for the laughter and sing for the tear (Come on!)
Sing it with me, it's just for today
Maybe tomorrow the good Lord will take you away[Intro]
High in the halls of the kings who are gone
Jenny would dance with her ghosts
The ones she had lost and the ones she had found
And the ones who had loved her the most

[Verse 1]
The ones who'd been gone for so very long
She couldn't remember their names
They spun her around on the damp old stone
Spun away all her sorrow and pain

[Chorus]
And she never wanted to leave, never wanted to leave
Never wanted to leave, never wanted to leave

[Verse 2]
They danced through the day and into the night
Through the snow that swept through the hall
From winter to summer and winter again
'Til the walls did crumble and fall

[Chorus]
And she never wanted to leave, never wanted to leave
Never wanted to leave, never wanted to leave
And she never wanted to leave, never wanted to leave
Never wanted to leave, never wanted to leave

[Outro]
High in the halls of the kings who are gone
Jenny would dance with her ghosts
The ones she had lost and the ones she had found
And the ones who had loved her the most[Intro]
Ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh

[Verse 1]
At seventeen I started to starve myself
I thought that love was a kind of emptiness
And at least I understood then the hunger I felt
And I didn't have to call it loneliness

[Chorus]
We all have a hunger
We all have a hunger
We all have a hunger
We all have a hunger

[Pre-Chorus]
Tell me what you need
Oh, you look so free
The way you use your body, baby
Come on and work it for me
Don't let them get you down
You're the best thing I've seen
We never found the answer
But we knew one thing

[Chorus]
We all have a hunger
(We all have a hunger)
We all have a hunger
(We all have a hunger)
We all have a hunger
(We all have a hunger)
We all have a hunger
(We all have a hunger)

[Post-Chorus]
And it's Friday night and it's kicking in
In that pink dress, they're gonna crucify me
Oh and you in all your vibrant youth
How could anything bad ever happen to you?
You make a fool of death with your beauty
And for a moment

[Verse 2]
I thought that love was in the drugs
But the more I took, the more it took away
And I could never get enough
I thought that love was on the stage, give yourself to strangers
You don't have to be afraid
Then it tries to find a home
With people or when I'm alone
Picking it apart
And staring at your phone

[Chorus]
We all have a hunger
We all have a hunger
We all have a hunger
We all have a hunger

[Pre-Chorus]
Tell me what you need
Oh, you look so free
The way you use your body, baby
Come on and work it for me
Don't let them get you down
You're the best thing I've seen
We never found the answer
But we knew one thing

[Chorus]
We all have a hunger
(We all have a hunger)
We all have a hunger
(We all have a hunger)
We all have a hunger
(We all have a hunger)
We all have a hunger
(We all have a hunger)

[Post-Chorus]
And it's Friday night and it's kicking in
In that pink dress, they're gonna crucify me
Oh and you in all your vibrant youth
How could anything bad ever happen to you?
You make a fool of death with your beauty
And for a moment I forget to worry[Verse 1]
Happiness hit her, like a train on a track
Coming towards her, stuck still no turning back
She hid around corners and she hid under beds
She killed it with kisses and from it she fled
With every bubble she sank with a drink
And washed it away down the kitchen sink

[Chorus]
The dog days are over
The dog days are done
The horses are coming
So you better run
Run fast for your mother, run fast for your father
Run for your children, for your sisters and brothers
Leave all your love and your longing behind
You can't carry it with you if you want to survive
The dog days are over
The dog days are done
Can you hear the horses?
'Cause here they come

[Bridge]
And I never wanted anything from you
Except everything you had
And what was left after that too, oh

[Verse 2]
Happiness hit her like a bullet in the back, back, back...
Struck from a great height
By someone who should know better than that

[Chorus]
The dog days are over
The dog days are done
Can you hear the horses?
'Cause here they come
Run fast for your mother, run fast for your father
Run for your children, for your sisters and brothers
Leave all your love and your longing behind
You can't carry it with you if you want to survive
The dog days are over
The dog days are done
Can you hear the horses?
'Cause here they come

[Outro]
The dog days are over
The dog days are gone
Can you hear the horses?
'Cause here they come
The dog days are over
The dog days are gone
Can you hear the horses?
'Cause here they come[Verse 1]
Regrets collect like old friends
Here to relive your darkest moments
I can see no way, I can see no way
And all of the ghouls come out to play
And every demon wants his pound of flesh
But I like to keep some things to myself
I like to keep my issues drawn
It's always darkest before the dawn

And I've been a fool and I've been blind
I can never leave the past behind
I can see no way, I can see no way
I'm always dragging that horse around
All of his questions, such a mournful sound
Tonight I'm gonna bury that horse in the ground
Cause I like to keep my issues drawn
But it's always darkest before the dawn

[Chorus]
Shake it out, shake it out
Shake it out, shake it out, ooh whoa
Shake it out, shake it out
Shake it out, shake it out, ooh whoa
And it's hard to dance with a devil on your back
So shake him off, oh whoa

[Verse 2]
And I am done with my graceless heart
So tonight I'm gonna cut it out and then restart
Cause I like to keep my issues drawn
It's always darkest before the dawn

[Chorus]
Shake it out, shake it out
Shake it out, shake it out, ooh whoa
Shake it out, shake it out
Shake it out, shake it out, ooh whoa
And it's hard to dance with a devil on your back
So shake him off, oh whoa (shake him off)

[Verse 3]
And it's hard to dance with a devil on your back
(shake him off)
And given half the chance, would I take any of it back
(shake him off)
It's a fine romance but it's left me so undone
(shake him off)
It's always darkest before the dawn
Ooh whoa, ooh whoa

[Bridge]
And I'm damned if I do and I'm damned if I don't
So here's to drinks in the dark at the end of my rope
And I'm ready to suffer and I'm ready to hope
It's a shot in the dark aimed right at my throat
'Cause looking for heaven, found the devil in me (whoa)
Looking for heaven, found the devil in me (whoa)
Well, what the hell, I'm gonna let it happen to me
Yeah

[Chorus]
Shake it out, shake it out
Shake it out, shake it out, ooh whoa
Shake it out, shake it out
Shake it out, shake it out, ooh whoa
And it's hard to dance with a devil on your back
So shake him off, oh whoa
Shake it out, shake it out
Shake it out, shake it out, ooh whoa
Shake it out, shake it out
Shake it out, shake it out, ooh whoa
And it's hard to dance with a devil on your back
So shake him off, oh whoa
Oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh

[Outro]
(What the hell)
(What the hell)
What the hell
What the hell
What the hell[Verse 1]
Drifting through the halls with the sunrise
(Holding on for your call)
Climbing up the walls for that flashing light
(I can never let go)
'Cause I'm gonna be free and I'm gonna be fine
(Holding on for your call)
'Cause I'm gonna be free and I'm gonna be fine
(Maybe not tonight)

Now the sun is up and I'm going blind
(Holding on for your call)
Another drink just to pass the time
(I can never say no)
'Cause I'm gonna be free and I'm gonna be fine
(Holding on for your call)
'Cause I'm gonna be free and I'm gonna be fine
(Maybe not tonight)

[Chorus]
It's a different kind of danger
And the bells are ringing out
And I'm calling for my mother
As I pull the pillars down
It's a different kind of danger
And my feet are spinning round
Never knew I was a dancer
'Til Delilah showed me how

[Interlude]
Too fast for freedom
Sometimes it all falls down
These chains never leave me
I keep dragging them around

[Verse 2]
Now I'm dancing with Delilah and her vision is mine
(Holding on for your call)
A different kind of danger in the daylight
(I can never let go)
Took anything to cut you, I can find
(Holding on for your call)
A different kind of a danger in the daylight
(Can't you let me know?)

Now it's one more boy and it's one more line
(Holding on for your call)
Taking the pills just to pass the time
(I can never say no)
'Cause I'm gonna be free and I'm gonna be fine
(Holding on for your call)
'Cause I'm gonna be free and I'm gonna be fine
But maybe not tonight

[Chorus]
It's a different kind of danger
And the bells are ringing out
And I'm calling for my mother
As I pull the pillars down
It's a different kind of danger
And my feet are spinning round
Never knew I was a dancer
'Til Delilah showed me how

[Verse 3]
Now I'm dancing with Delilah and her vision is mine
(Holding on for your call)
A different kind of danger in the daylight
(I can never let go)
Took anything to cut you, I can find
(Holding on for your call)
A different kind of a danger in the daylight
(Can't you let me know?)

[Bridge]
Strung up, strung out for your love
Hanging, hung up, it's so rough
I'm wrung and wringing out
Why can't you let me know?
Strung up, strung out for your love
Hanging, hung up, it's so rough
I'm wrung and wringing out
Why can't you let me know?

[Chorus]
It's a different kind of danger
And the bells are ringing out
And I'm calling for my mother
As I pull the pillars down
It's a different kind of danger
And my feet are spinning round
Never knew I was a dancer
'Til Delilah showed me how

It's a different kind of danger
And the bells are ringing out
And I'm calling for my mother
As I pull the pillars down
It's a different kind of danger
And my feet are spinning around
Never knew I was a dancer
'Til Delilah showed me how

[Outro]
Too fast for freedom
Sometimes it all falls down
These chains never leave me
I keep dragging them around
Too fast for freedom
Sometimes it all falls down
These chains never leave me
I keep dragging them around[Verse 1]
How deeply are you sleeping or are you still awake?
A good friend told me you've been staying out so late
Be careful, oh, my darling, oh, be careful what it takes
From what I've seen so far, the good ones always seem to break
And I was screaming at my father and you were screaming at me
And I can feel your anger from way across the sea
And I was kissing strangers, I was causing such a scene
Oh, the heart it hides such unimaginable things

[Pre-Chorus]
Grab me by my ankles, I've been flying for too long
I couldn't hide from the thunder in a sky full of song
And I want you so badly, but you could be anyone
I couldn't hide from the thunder in a sky full of song

[Chorus]
Hold me down, I'm so tired now
Aim your arrow at the sky
Take me down, I'm too tired now
Leave me where I lie

[Verse 2]
And I can tell that I'm in trouble when that music starts to play
In a city without seasons, it keeps raining in LA
I feel like I'm about to fall, the room begins to sway
And I can hear the sirens but I cannot walk away

[Pre-Chorus]
Grab me by my ankles, I've been flying for too long
I couldn't hide from the thunder in a sky full of song
And I want you so badly, but you could be anyone
I couldn't hide from the thunder in a sky full of song

[Chorus]
Hold me down, I'm so tired now
Aim your arrow at the sky
Take me down, I'm too tired now
Leave me where I lie

[Bridge]
I thought I was flying but maybe I'm dying tonight
I thought I was flying but maybe I'm dying tonight
And I thought I was flying but maybe I'm dying tonight
And I thought I was flying but maybe I'm dying tonight

[Chorus]
Hold me down, I'm so tired now
Aim your arrow at the sky (Shoot, shoot, shoot)
Take me down, I'm too tired now
Leave me where I lie (Fire)

[Chorus]
Hold me down, I'm too tired now
Aim your arrow at the sky (Shoot, shoot, shoot)
And take me down, I'm too tired now
Leave me where I lie (Fire)[Chorus]
You need a big god
Big enough to hold your love
You need a big god
Big enough to fill you up

[Verse 1]
You keep me up at night
To my messages, you do not reply
You know I still like you the most
The best of the best and the worst of the worst
Well, you can never know
The places that I go
I still like you the most
You'll always be my favourite ghost

[Chorus]
You need a big god
Big enough to hold your love
You need a big god
Big enough to fill you up

[Verse 2]
Sometimes I think it's getting better
And then it gets much worse
Is it just part of the process?
Jesus Christ, it hurts
Though I know I should know better
Well, I can make this work
Is it just part of the process?
Jesus Christ, Jesus Christ, it hurts
(Jesus Christ, Jesus Christ, it hurts)

[Chorus]
You need a big god
Big enough to hold your love
You need a big god
Big enough to fill you up

[Non-Lyrical Vocal Interlude]

[Outro]
Shower your affection, let it rain on me
Pull down the mountain, drag your cities to the sea
Shower your affection, let it rain on me
Don't leave me on this white cliff
Let it slide down to the, slide down to the sea
Slide down to the, slide down to the sea[Verse 1]
Looking up from underneath
Fractured moonlight on the sea
Reflections still look the same to me
As before I went under

And it's peaceful in the deep
Cathedral where you cannot breathe
No need to pray, no need to speak
Now I am under all

[Pre-Chorus]
And it's breaking over me
A thousand miles down to the sea bed
Found the place to rest my head
Never let me go, never let me go
Never let me go, never let me go

[Chorus]
And the arms of the ocean are carrying me
And all this devotion was rushing out of me
And the crashes are heaven, for a sinner like me
But the arms of the ocean delivered me

[Verse 2]
Though the pressure's hard to take
It's the only way I can escape
It seems a heavy choice to make
And now I am under, oh

[Pre-Chorus]
And it's breaking over me
A thousand miles down to the sea bed
Found the place to rest my head
Never let me go, never let me go
Never let me go, never let me go

[Chorus]
And the arms of the ocean are carrying me
And all this devotion was rushing out of me
And the crashes are heaven, for a sinner like me
But the arms of the ocean delivered me

[Bridge]
And it's over and I'm going under
But I'm not giving up, I'm just giving in
I'm slipping underneath
So cold and so sweet

And the arms of the ocean so sweet and so cold
And all this devotion I never knew at all
And the crashes are heaven for a sinner released
And the arms of the ocean delivered me

[Outro]
Never let me go, never let me go
Never let me go, never let me go
Delivered me
Never let me go, never let me go
Never let me go, never let me go
Delivered me
Never let me go, never let me go
Never let me go, never let me go
Delivered me
Never let me go, never let me go
Never let me go, never let me go

And it's over and I'm going under
But I'm not giving up, I'm just giving in
I'm slipping underneath
So cold and so sweet[Verse 1]
I tried to leave it all behind me
But I woke up and there they were beside me
And I don't believe it but I guess it's true
Some feelings, they can travel too
Oh there it is again, sitting on my chest
Makes it hard to catch my breath
I scramble for the light of change

[Pre-Chorus]
You're always on my mind
You're always on my mind

[Chorus]
And I never minded being on my own
Then something broke in me and I wanted to go home
To be where you are
But even closer to you, you seem so very far
And now I'm reaching out with every note I sing
And I hope it gets to you on some pacific wind
Wraps itself around you and whispers in your ear
Tells you that I miss you and I wish that you were here

[Verse 2]
And if I stay, oh, I don't know
There'll be so much that I'll have to let go
You're disappearing all the time
But I still see you in the light
For you, the shadows fight
And it's beautiful but there's that tug inside
I must stop time traveling, you're always on my mind

[Pre-Chorus]
You're always on my mind
You're always on my mind

[Chorus]
And I never minded being on my own
Then something broke in me and I wanted to go home
To be where you are
But even closer to you, you seem so very far
And now I'm reaching out with every note I sing
And I hope it gets to you on some pacific wind
Wraps itself around you and whispers in your ear
Tells you that I miss you and I wish that you were here

[Bridge]
We all need something watching over us
Be it the falcons, the clouds or the cross
And then the sea swept in and left us all speechless
Speechless

[Chorus]
And I never minded being on my own
Then something broke in me and I wanted to go home
To be where you are
But even closer to you, you seem so very far
And now I'm reaching out with every note I sing
And I hope it gets to you on some pacific wind
Wraps itself around you and whispers in your ear
Tells you that I miss you and I wish that you were here

[Post-Chorus]
Wish that you were here
Wish that you were here
Wish that you were here
I wish that you...[Verse 1]
Oh Patricia, you've always been my North Star
And I have to tell you something
I'm still afraid of the dark
But you take my hand in your hand
From you the flowers grow
And do you understand with every seed you sow
You make this cold world beautiful?

[Pre-Chorus]
You told me all doors are open to the believer
I believe her, I believe her, I believe her
You told me all doors are open to the believer
I believe her, I believe her, I believe her

[Chorus]
Oh Patricia, you've always been my North Star, oh
Oh Patricia, you've always been my North Star, oh

[Verse 2]
Well, you're a 'real man', and you do what you can
You only take as much as you can grab with two hands
With your big heart, you praise God above
But how's that working out for you, honey?
Do you feel loved?

[Pre-Chorus]
She told me all doors are open to the believer
I believe her, I believe her, I believe her
Do you feel loved? Do you feel loved?
She told me all doors are open to the believer
I believe her, I believe her, I believe her
Do you feel loved?

[Chorus]
Oh Patricia, you've always been my North Star, oh
Oh Patricia, you've always been my North Star, oh

[Outro]
I drink too much coffee and think of you often
In a city where reality has long been forgotten
And are you afraid? 'Cause I'm terrified
But you remind me that it's such a wonderful thing to love
It's such a wonderful thing to love
It's such a wonderful thing to love
It's such a wonderful thing to love
It's such a wonderful thing
It's such a wonderful thing to love
It's such a wonderful thing to love
It's such a wonderful thing to love
It's such a wonderful thing to love
It's such a wonderful thing[Verse 1]
A falling star fell from your heart and landed in my eyes
I screamed aloud, as it tore through them
And now it's left me blind

[Chorus]
The stars, the moon, they have all been blown out
You left me in the dark
No dawn, no day, I'm always in this twilight
In the shadow of your heart

[Verse 2]
And in the dark, I can hear your heartbeat
I tried to find the sound
But then it stopped, till I was in the darkness
So darkness I became

[Chorus]
The stars, the moon, they have all been blown out
You left me in the dark
No dawn, no day, I'm always in this twilight
In the shadow of your heart

[Bridge]
I took the stars from our eyes, and then I made a map
And knew that somehow I could find my way back
Then I heard your heart beating, you were in the darkness too
So I stayed in the darkness with you

[Chorus]
The stars, the moon, they have all been blown out
You left me in the dark
No dawn, no day, I'm always in this twilight
In the shadow of your heart

The stars, the moon, they have all been blown out
You left me in the dark
No dawn, no day, I'm always in this twilight
In the shadow of your heart[Verse 1]
I was on a heavy tip
Trying to cross a canyon with a broken limb
You were on the other side, like always
Wondering what to do with life

[Verse 2]
I'd already had a sip
So I'd reasoned I was drunk enough to deal with it
You were on the other side, like always
You could never make your mind

[Pre-Chorus]
And with one kiss
You inspired a fire of devotion that lasts for twenty years
What kind of man loves like this?

[Verse 3]
To let me dangle at a cruel angle
Oh, my feet don't touch the floor
Sometimes you're half in and then you're half out
But you never close the door

[Chorus]
What kind of man loves like this?
What kind of man?
What kind of man loves like this?
What kind of man?

[Verse 4]
You're a holy fool, all coloured blue
Red feet upon the floor
You do such damage, how do you manage?
To have me crawling back for more

[Pre-Chorus]
And with one kiss
And with one kiss
You inspired a fire of devotion that lasts for twenty years
For twenty years
What kind of man loves like this?

[Chorus]
What kind of man loves like this?
What kind of man?
What kind of man loves like this?
What kind of man?

[Verse 5]
But I can't beat ya, 'cause I'm still with ya
"Oh mercy", I implore
"Oh mercy", I implore
How do you do it? I think I'm through it
Then I'm back against the wall
Back, back, back against the wall

[Chorus]
What kind of man loves like this?
What kind of man?
What kind of man loves like this?
What kind of man?

[Chorus]
What kind of man loves like this?
What kind of man?
What kind of man loves like this?
What kind of man?[Verse 1]
Don't touch the sleeping pills, they mess with my head
Dredging up great white sharks, swimming in the bed
And here comes a killer whale, to sing me to sleep
Thrashing the covers off, has me by its teeth

[Pre-Chorus]
And, ah, my love remind me, what was it that I said?
I can't help but pull the earth around me to make my bed
And, ah, my love remind me, what was it that I did?
Did I drink too much? Am I losing touch?
Did I build a ship to wreck?

[Chorus]
To wreck, to wreck, to wreck
Did I build this ship to wreck?

[Verse 2]
What's with the long face? Do you want more?
Thousands of red-eyed mice, scratching at the door
And don't let the curtain catch you, cause you've been here before
The chair is an island, darling, you can't touch the floor

[Pre-Chorus]
And, ah, my love remind me, what was it that I said?
I can't help but pull the earth around me to make my bed
And, ah, my love remind me, what was it that I did?
Did I drink too much? Am I losing touch?
Did I build a ship to wreck?

[Chorus]
To wreck, to wreck, to wreck
Did I build this ship to wreck?

[Bridge]
Good God, under starless skies
We are lost, and into the breach, we got tossed
And the water's coming in fast

[Pre-Chorus]
And, ah, my love remind me, what was it that I said?
I can't help but pull the earth around me to make my bed
And, ah, my love remind me, what was it that I did?
Did I drink too much? Am I losing touch?
Did I build a ship to wreck?

[Chorus]
To wreck, to wreck, to wreck
Did I build this ship to wreck?
To wreck, to wreck, to wreck
Did I build this ship to wreck?[Verse 1]
I feel nervous in a way that can't be named
I dreamt last night of a sign that read "The end of love"
And I remember thinking
Even in my dreaming
It was a good line for a song

[Pre-Chorus]
We were a family pulled from the flood
You tore the floorboards up
And let the river rush in
Not wash away, wash away

[Chorus]
We were reaching in the dark
That summer in New York
And it was so far to fall
But it didn't hurt at all
And let it wash away, wash away

[Verse 2]
In a moment of joy and fury I threw myself
From the balcony like my grandmother so many years before me
I've always been in love with you
Could you tell it from the moment that I met you?

[Pre-Chorus]
We were a family pulled from the flood
You tore the floorboards up
And let the river rush in
Not wash away, wash away

[Chorus]
We were reaching in the dark (Wash away)
That summer in New York (Wash away)
And was it so far to fall? (Wash away)
You said it didn't hurt at all
And let it wash away, wash away

[Bridge]
And Joshua came down from the mountain
With a tablet in his hands
Told me that he loved me, yeah
And then ghosted me again

[Chorus]
We were reaching in the dark
That summer in New York
And it was so far to fall
But it didn't hurt at all
I let it wash away, wash away

[Chorus]
Reaching in the dark (Wash away)
That summer in New York (Wash away)
And was it so far to fall? (Wash away)
You said it didn't hurt at all
And let it wash away, wash away[Verse 1]
Oh, the king
Gone mad within his suffering
Called out for release
Someone cure him of his grief

His only son
Cut down, but the battle won
Oh, what is it worth
When all that's left is hurt?

[Pre-Chorus]
Like the stars chase the sun
Over the glowing hill, I will conquer
Blood is running deep
Some things never sleep

[Chorus]
Suddenly I'm overcome
Dissolving like the setting sun
Like a boat into oblivion
'Cause you're driving me away
Now you have me on the run
The damage is already done
Come on, is this what you want?
'Cause you're driving me away

[Verse 2]
Oh, the queen of peace
Always does her best to please
But is it any use?
Somebody's gotta lose

Like a long scream
Out there, always echoing
Oh, what is it worth?
All that's left is hurt

[Pre-Chorus]
Like the stars chase the sun
Over the glowing hill, I will conquer
Blood is running deep
Some things never sleep

[Chorus]
Suddenly I'm overcome
Dissolving like the setting sun
Like a boat into oblivion
'Cause you're driving me away
Now you have me on the run
The damage is already done
Come on, is this what you want?
'Cause you're driving me away

[Bridge]
And my love is no good
Against the fortress that it made of you
Blood is running deep
Sorrow that you keep

[Chorus]
Suddenly I'm overcome
Dissolving like the setting sun
Like a boat into oblivion
'Cause you're driving me away
Now you have me on the run
The damage is already done
Come on, is this what you want?
'Cause you're driving me away

[Spoken Word]
To give yourself over to another body
That's all you want really
To be out of your own and consumed by another
To swim inside the skin of your lover
Not to have to breathe, not to have to think
But you can't live on love; salt water's no drink[Verse 1]
I believe in you
And in our hearts we know the truth
And I believe in love
And the darker it gets, the more I do
Try and fill us with your hate and we will shine a light
And the days will become endless
And never, and never turn to night
And never, and never turn to night

[Chorus]
Then it's just too much
I cannot get you close enough
A hundred arms, a hundred years
You can always find me here
And, Lord, don't let me break this
Let me hold it lightly
Give me arms to pray with
Instead of ones that hold too tightly

[Verse 2]
We have no need to fight
We raise our voices and let our hearts take flight
Get higher than those planes can fly
Where the stars do not take sides

[Chorus]
Then it's just too much
I cannot get you close enough
A hundred arms, a hundred years
You can always find me here
And, Lord, don't let me break this
Let me hold it lightly
Give me arms to pray with
Instead of ones that hold too tightly

[Chorus]
And then it's just too much
The streets, they still run with blood
A hundred arms, a hundred years
You can always find me here
And, Lord, don't let me break this
Let me hold it lightly
Give me arms to pray with
Instead of ones that hold too tightly

[Verse 3]
I let him sleep and as he does
My held breath fills the room with love
Hurts in ways I can't describe
My heart bends and breaks so many, many times
And is born again with each sunrise
And is born again with each sunrise

[Interlude]
Funerals were held all over the city
The youth bleed in the square
And women raged as old men fumbled and cried
"We're sorry, we thought you didn't care, oh"
And how does it feel now you've scratched that itch?
How does it feel?
And pulled out all your stitches
Hubris is a bitch
A hundred arms, a hundred years
A hundred arms, a hundred years

[Chorus]
And then it's just too much
The streets, they still run with blood
A hundred arms, a hundred years
You can always find me here
And, Lord, don't let me break this
Let me hold it lightly
Give me arms to pray with
Instead of ones that hold too tightly, yeah[Verse 1]
Holy water cannot help you now
Thousand armies couldn't keep me out
I don't want your money
I don't want your crown
See, I've come to burn your kingdom down

[Pre-Chorus]
Holy water cannot help you now
See, I've come to burn your kingdom down
And no rivers and no lakes can put the fire out
I'm gonna raise the stakes
I'm gonna smoke you out

[Chorus]
Seven devils all around you
Seven devils in my house
See, they were there when I woke up this morning
I'll be dead before the day is done
Seven devils all around you
Seven devils in your house
See, I was dead when I woke up this morning
And I'll be dead before the day is done
Before the day is done

[Verse 2]
And now all your love will be exorcized
And we will find new saints to be canonized
And it's an evensong, it's a litany
It's a battle cry, it's a symphony

[Chorus]
Seven devils all around you
Seven devils in my house
See, they were there when I woke up this morning
I'll be dead before the day is done
Seven devils all around you
Seven devils in your house
See, I was dead when I woke up this morning
And I'll be dead before the day is done

[Bridge]
Before the day is done
Before the day is done
Before the day is done

[Breakdown]
You can't keep it out
It's coming through the walls
To devastate your heart
And to take your soul
For what has been done
Cannot be undone
In the eagle's eye
In the evensong

[Outro]
Seven devils all around you
Seven devils in your house
See, I was dead when I woke up this morning
I'll be dead before the day is done
Before the day is done[Verse 1]
The show was ending and I had started to crack
Woke up in Chicago when the sky turned black
And you're so high, you're so high, you have to be an angel
And I'm so high, I'm so high, I can see an angel

[Pre-Chorus]
I hear your heart beating in your chest
The world slows till there's nothing left
Skyscrapers look on like great, unblinking giants
In those heavy days in June
When love became an act of defiance

[Chorus]
Hold on to each other
Hold on to each other
Hold on to each other
Hold on to each other

[Verse 2]
And you were broken-hearted
And the world was too
And I was beginning to lose my grip
And I have always held it loosely
But this time I admit
I felt it really start to slip
And choirs sing in the street
And I would come to you
To watch the television screen
In your hotel room
I'm always down to hide with you

[Chorus]
Hold on to each other
Hold on to each other
Hold on to each other
Hold on to each other

[Outro]
You're so high, you're so high
You're so high, you're so high
You're so high, you're so high
You have to be an angel
And I'm so high, I'm so high
I'm so high, I'm so high
I'm so high, I'm so high
I can see an angel[Verse 1]
Between a crucifix and the Hollywood sign, we decided to get hurt
Now theres a few things we have to burn
Set our hearts ablaze, and every city was a gift
And every skyline was like a kiss upon the lips
And I was making you a wish
In every skyline

[Chorus]
How big, how blue, how beautiful
How big, how blue, how beautiful

[Verse 2]
And meanwhile a man was falling from space
And every day I wore your face
Like an atmosphere around me
The satellite beside me

And meanwhile a man was falling from space
As he hit the earth I left this place
Let the atmosphere surround me
The satellite beside me

[Pre-Chorus]
What are we gonna do?
We've opened the door, now it's all coming through
Tell me you see it too
We opened our eyes and it's changing the view
Oh, what are we gonna do?
We opened the door now, it's all coming through

[Chorus]
How big, how blue, how (beautiful)
How big, how blue, how (beautiful)

[Verse 3]
And every city was a gift
And every skyline was like a kiss upon the lips
And I was making you a wish
In every skyline

And meanwhile a man was falling from space
And every day I wore your face
Like an atmosphere around me
I'm happy you're beside me

[Pre-Chorus]
What are we gonna do?
We've opened the door, now it's all coming through
Tell me you see it too
We opened our eyes and it's changing the view
Oh, what are we gonna do?
We opened the door now, it's all coming through

[Chorus]
How big, how blue, how beautiful
How big, how blue, how beautiful
How big, how blue, how...

[Bridge]
So much time on the other side
Waiting for you to wake up
So much time on the other side
Waiting for you to wake up
Maybe I'll see you in another life
If this one wasn't enough
So much time on the other side

[Chorus]
How big, how blue, how beautiful
How big, how blue, how...[Verse 1]
Ever since I was a child
I've turned it over in my mind
I sang by the piano
Tore my yellow dress and
Cried and cried and cried

[Pre-Chorus]
Now to unsee what I've seen
To undo what has been done
Turn off all the lights
Let the morning come, come

[Chorus]
Now there's green light in my eyes
And my lover on my mind
And I sing from the piano
Tear my yellow dress and
Cry and cry and cry
Over the love of you

[Verse 2]
All this champagne drunken home
Against the current of gold
Everybody see I love him
Cause it's a feeling that you get
When the afternoon is set
On the bridge into the city

[Pre-Chorus]
And now to unsee what I've seen
To undo what has been done
Turn off all the lights
Let the morning come

[Chorus]
Now there's green light in my eyes
And my lover on my mind
And I sing from the piano
Tear my yellow dress and
Cry and cry and cry

[Bridge]
Because you're a hard soul to save
With an ocean in my way
But I'll get around it, I'll get around it
Cause you're a hard soul to save
With an ocean in the way
But I'll get around it

[Chorus]
Now there's green light in my eyes
And my lover on my mind
And I sing from the piano
Tear my yellow dress and
Cry and cry and cry
Over the love of you

[Outro]
Cry and cry and cry and
Over the love of you
Cry and cry and cry and
Over the love of you
Cry and cry and cry and
Over the love of you
I can see the green light, I can see it in your eyes
I can see the green light, I can see it in your eyes
I can see the green light, I can see it in your eyes
I can see the green light, I can see it in your eyes
I can see the green light, I can see it in your eyes[Verse 1]
I'm sorry I ruined your birthday
I guess I could go back to university
Try and make my mother proud
Stop this phase I'm in, she deems dangerous  and loud
The spelling is a problem
As is the discipline
And I don't think it would be too long
Before I was drunk in Camberwell again

[Pre-Chorus]
This is the only thing I've ever had any faith in

[Chorus]
Grace, I know you carry us
Grace, and it was such a mess
Grace, I don't say it enough
Grace, you are so loved

[Verse 2]
I'm sorry I ruined your birthday, you had turned 18
And the sunshine hit me and I was behaving strangely
All the walls were melting and there were mermaids everywhere
Hearts flew from my hands, and I could see people's feelings

[Pre-Chorus]
This is the only thing I've ever had any faith in

[Chorus]
Grace, I know you carry us
Grace, and it was such a mess
Grace, I don't say it enough
Grace, you are so loved

[Bridge]
And you, you were the one I treated the worst
Only because you loved me the most
We haven't spoken in a long time
I think about it sometimes
I don't know who I was back then
And I hope on hope (hope on hope)
I would never treat anyone like that again

[Pre-Chorus]
This is the only thing I've ever had any faith in

[Chorus]
Grace, I know you carry us
Grace, and it was such a mess
Grace, I don't say it enough
Grace, you are so loved

[Chorus]
Grace, I know you carry us
Grace, and it was such a fucking mess
Grace, I don't say it enough
Grace, you are so loved

[Outro]
This is the only thing I've ever had any faith in
(Tell me what I can do, I will make it up to you)
This is the only thing I've ever had any faith in
(Tell me what I can do, I will make it up to you)
This is the only thing I've ever had any faith in
This is the only thing I've ever had any faith in[Chorus 1]
That original lifeline
Original lifeline
That original lifeline

[Verse 1]
Hey, look up
Don't make a shadow of yourself
Always shutting out the light
Caught in your own creation
Look up, look up
It tore you open
And oh, how much?

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause there's a hole where your heart lies
And I can see it with my third eye
And though my touch, it magnifies
You pull away, you don't know why

[Chorus 1]
That original lifeline
Original lifeline
That original lifeline

[Verse 2]
Hey, look up
You don't have to be a ghost
Here amongst the living
You are flesh and blood
And you deserve to be loved
And you deserve what you are given
And oh, how much?

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause there's a hole where your heart lies
And I can see it with my third eye
And though my touch, it magnifies
You pull away, you don't know why

[Chorus 1]
That original lifeline
Original lifeline
That original lifeline
Original lifeline

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause there's a hole where your heart lies
And I can see it with my third eye
And though my touch, it magnifies
You pull away, you don't know why

[Chorus 1]
That original lifeline
Original lifeline
That original lifeline
That original lifeline

[Bridge]
'Cause your pain is a tribute
The only thing you let hold you
Wear it now like a mantle
Always there to remind you
But your pain is a tribute
The only thing you let hold you
Wear it now like a mantle
Always there to remind you

[Chorus 2]
I'm the same, I'm the same
I'm trying to change
I am the same, I'm the same
I'm trying to change
I am the same, I'm the same
I'm trying to change
I am the same, I'm the same
I'm trying to change

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause there's a hole where your heart lies
And I can see it with my third eye
And though my touch, it magnifies
You pull away, you don't know why

[Outro]
I'm the same, I'm the same
I'm trying to change
That original lifeline
I am the same, I'm the same
I'm trying to change
Original lifeline
I am the same, I'm the same
I'm trying to change
That original lifeline
I am the same, I'm the same
I'm trying to change
Original lifeline
I'm the same, I'm the same
I'm trying to change
That original lifeline
I am the same, I'm the same
I'm trying to change
Original lifeline
I am the same, I'm the same
I'm trying to change
That original lifeline
I am the same, I'm the same
I'm trying to change
That original lifeline[Verse 1]
When I go home alone
I drive past the place where I was born
And the places where I used to drink
Young and drunk and stumbling in the street
Outside the Joiners Arms like foals unsteady on their feet
With the art students and the boys in bands
High on E and holding hands with someone that I just met

[Refrain]
I thought, "It doesn't get better than this
There can be nothing better than this, better than this."

[Verse 2]
And we climbed onto the roof of the museum
And someone made love in the grass
And I forgot my name
And the way back to my mother's house
With your Blackpool eyes and your bitten lips
The world is at your fingertips

[Refrain]
It doesn't get better than this
What else could be better than this?

[Chorus]
Oh, do you know what I've seen?
I have seen the fields aflame
And everything I ever did
Was just another way to scream your name

[Post-Chorus]
Over and over and over and over again
Over and over and over and over again

[Verse 3]
And we're just children wanting children of our own
I want  a space to watch things grow
But did I dream too big? Do I have to let it go?
And what if one day there is no such thing as snow?
Oh God, what do I know?

[Interlude]
And I don't know anything
Except that green is so green
And there's a special kind of sadness that seems to come with spring

[Chorus]
Oh, do you know what I have seen?
I have seen the fields aflame
But everything I ever did
Was just another way to scream your name

[Post-Chorus]
Over and over and over and over again
Over and over and over and over again

[Chorus]
Oh, do you know what I've seen?
I have seen the fields aflame
But everything I ever did
Was just another way to scream your name[Chorus]
Sometimes, I feel like throwing my hands up in the air
I know I can count on you
Sometimes, I feel like saying, "Lord, I just don't care"
But you've got the love I need to see me through

[Verse 1]
Sometimes, it seems the going is just too rough
And things go wrong no matter what I do
Now and then, it seems that life is just too much
But you've got the love I need to see me through
When food is gone, you are my daily meal, oh
When friends are gone, I know my savior's love is real
You know it's real

[Hook]
'Cause you've got the love, you've got the love
You've got the love, you've got the love
You've got the love, you've got the love

[Verse 2]
Time after time I think, "Oh, Lord, what's the use?"
Time after time, I think it's just no good
'Cause sooner or later in life, the things you love, you lose
But you've got the love I need to see me through

[Hook]
You've got the love, you've got the love
You've got the love, you've got the love
You've got the love, you've got the love
You've got the love, you've got the love
You've got the love, you've got the love
You've got the love, you've got the love

[Outro]
Sometimes, I feel like throwing my hands up in the air
'Cause I know I can count on you, oh
Sometimes, I feel like saying, "Lord, I just don't care"
But you've got the love I need to see me through[Verse 1]
And the air was full
Of various storms and saints
Parading in the streets
As the banks began to break
And I'm in the throes of it
Somewhere in the belly of the beast
But you took your toll on me
So I gave myself over willingly
You got a hold on me
And I don't know how I don't just stand outside and scream
I am teaching myself how to be free

[Verse 2]
The monument of a memory
You tear it down in your head
Don't make the mountain your enemy
Get out, get up there instead
You saw the stars out in front of you
Too tempting not to touch
But even though it shocked you
Something's electric in your blood

[Pre-Chorus]
Can people just untie themselves
Uncurling like flowers
If you could just forgive yourself

[Chorus]
But still you stumble, your feet give way
Outside the world seems a violent place
But you had to have him, and so you did
Some things you let go in order to live
While all around you, the buildings sway
You sing it out loud, "who made us this way?"
I know you're bleeding, but you'll be okay
Hold on to your heart, you'll keep it safe
Hold on to your heart, don't give it away

[Verse 3]
Now find a rooftop to sing from
Now find a hallway to dance
You don't need no edge to cling from
Your heart is there, it's in your hands
I know it seems like forever
I know it seems like an age
But one day this will be over
I swear it's not so far away

[Pre-Chorus]
Can people just untie themselves
Uncurling like flowers
If you could just forgive yourself

[Chorus]
But still you stumble, your feet give way
Outside the world seems a violent place
But you had to have him, and so you did
Some things you let go in order to live
While all around you, the buildings sway
You sing it out loud, "who made us this way?"
I know you're bleeding, but you'll be okay
Hold on to your heart, you'll keep it safe
Hold on to your heart[Verse 1]
Another conversation with no destination
Another battle never won
And each side is a loser
So who cares who fired the gun?

[Pre-Chorus]
And I'm learning, so I'm leaving
And even though I'm grieving
I'm trying to find the meaning
Letting loss reveal it
Letting loss reveal it

[Chorus]
St. Jude, the patron saint of the lost causes
St. Jude, we were lost before she started
St. Jude, we lay in bed as she whipped around us
St. Jude, maybe I've always been more comfortable in chaos

[Verse 2]
And I was on the island and you were there too
But somehow through the storm I couldn't get to you
St. Jude, somehow she knew
And she came to give her blessing while causing devastation
And I couldn't keep my mouth shut, I just had to mention
Grabbing your attention

[Chorus]
St. Jude, the patron saint of the lost causes
St. Jude, we were lost before she started
St. Jude, we lay in bed as she whipped around us
St. Jude, maybe I've always been more comfortable in chaos

[Bridge]
St. Jude, St. Jude
St. Jude, St. Jude

[Outro]
And I'm learning, so I'm leaving
And even though I'm grieving
I'm trying to find the meaning
Letting loss reveal it
Letting loss reveal it
And I'm learning, so I'm leaving
And even though I'm grieving
I'm trying to find the meaning
Letting loss reveal it
Letting loss reveal it[Verse 1]
You are the hole in my head
You are the space in my bed
You are the silence in between
What I thought and what I said
You are the night-time fear
You are the morning when it's clear
When it's over, you're the start
You're my head and you're my heart

[Chorus]
No light, no light
In your bright blue eyes
I never knew daylight could be so violent
A revelation in the light of day
You can't choose what stays and what fades away
And I'd do anything to make you stay
No light, no light
Tell me what you want me to say

[Verse 2]
Through the crowd I was crying out and
In your place there were a thousand other faces
I was disappearing in plain sight
Heaven help me, I need to make it right

[Pre-Chorus]
You want a revelation
You want to get right
But it's a conversation
I just can't have tonight
You want a revelation
Some kind of resolution
You want a revelation

[Chorus]
No light, no light
In your bright blue eyes
I never knew daylight could be so violent
A revelation in the light of day
You can't choose what stays and what fades away
And I'd do anything to make you stay
No light, no light
Tell me what you want me to say

[Bridge]
Would you leave me
If I told you what I've done?
And would you leave me
If I told you what I've become?
Because it's so easy
To say it to a crowd
But it's so hard, my love
To say it to you out loud

[Chorus]
No light, no light
In your bright blue eyes
I never knew daylight could be so violent
A revelation in the light of day
You can't choose what stays and what fades away
And I'd do anything to make you stay
No light, no light
Tell me what you want me to say

[Outro]
You want a revelation
You want to get right
But it's a conversation
I just can't have tonight
You want a revelation
Some kind of resolution
You want a revelation

You want a revelation
You want to get right
But it's a conversation
I just can't have tonight
You want a revelation
Some kind of resolution
Tell me what you want me to say[Verse 1]
And it's hard to write about being happy
'Cause the older I get
I find that happiness is an extremely uneventful subject

[Chorus 1]
And there would be no grand choirs to sing
No chorus could come in
About two people sitting doing nothing

[Verse 2]
But I must confess
I did it all for myself
I gathered you here to hide from some vast unnameable fear
But the loneliness never left me
I always took it with me
But I can put it down in the pleasure of your company

[Chorus 2]
And there will be no grand choirs to sing
No chorus will come in
No ballad will be written
It will be entirely forgotten

[Verse 3]
And if tomorrow it's all over
At least we had it for a moment
Oh, darling, things seem so unstable
But for a moment we were able to be still

[Chorus 2]
And there will be no grand choirs to sing
No chorus will come in
No ballad will be written
This will be entirely forgotten

[Non-Lyrical Vocal Outro][Verse 1]
Time it took us
To where the water was
Thats what the water gave me
And time goes quicker
Between the two of us
But oh, my love, dont forsake me
Take what the water gave me

[Chorus]
Lay me down
Let the only sound
Be the overflow
Pockets full of stones
Lay me down
Let the only sound
Be the overflow

[Verse 2]
And oh, poor Atlas
The worlds a beast of a burden
Youve been holding on a long time
And all this longing
And the ships are left to rust
Thats what the water gave us

[Chorus]
So lay me down
Let the only sound
Be the overflow
Pockets full of stones
Lay me down
Let the only sound
Be the overflow

[Verse 3]
Because they took your loved ones
But returned them in exchange for you
But would you have it any other way?
Would you have it any other way?
You couldn't have it any other way

[Bridge]
Because shes a cruel mistress
And a bargain must be made
But oh, my love, dont forget me
While I let the water take me

[Chorus]
Lay me down
Let the only sound
Be the overflow
Pockets full of stones
Lay me down
Let the only sound
Be the overflow

So lay me down
Let the only sound
Be the overflow
Pockets full of stones
Lay me down
Let the only sound
Be the overflow[Verse 1]
And I had a dream
About my old school
And she was there all pink and gold and glittering
I threw my arms around her legs
Came to weeping (came to weeping)
Came to weeping (came to weeping)

[Pre-Chorus]
And I heard your voice as clear as day
And you told me I should concentrate
It was all so strange and so surreal
That a ghost should be so practical
Only if for a night

[Chorus]
And the only solution was to stand and fight
And my body was bruised and I was set alight
But you came over me like some holy rite
And although I was burning, you're the only light
Only if for a night

[Verse 2]
And the grass was so green against my new clothes
And I did cartwheels in your honor
Dancing on tiptoes
My own secret ceremonials
Before the service began
In the graveyard doing handstands

[Pre-Chorus]
And I heard your voice as clear as day
And you told me I should concentrate
It was all so strange and so surreal
That a ghost should be so practical
Only if for a night

[Chorus]
And the only solution was to stand and fight
And my body was bruised and I was set alight
But you came over me like some holy rite
And although I was burning, you're the only light
Only if for a night

[Bridge]
My doe, my dear, my darling
Tell me what all the sighing is about
Tell me what all the sighing is about

[Pre-Chorus]
And I heard your voice as clear as day
And you told me I should concentrate
It was all so strange and so surreal
That a ghost should be so practical

[Outro]
Only if for a night (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Only if for a night (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Only if for a night (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Only if for a night (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Only if for a night (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Only if for a night (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Only if for a night (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Only if for a night (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)[Verse 1]
Want me to love you in moderation
Do I look moderate to you?
Sip it slowly and pay attention
I just have to see it through
You got me looking for validation
Pastures new
Want me to love you in moderation
Well, who do you think you're talking to?

[Chorus]
Then bow your head in the house of God
And little girl, who do you think you are?
You think you need it, you think you want love
You wouldn't want it if you knew what it was
Moderation
Moderation
Moderation (Ooh)

[Verse 2]
I never made it with moderation
No, I never understood
All the feeling was all or nothing
And I took everything I could
Can't hold it back, I can't take the tension
Oh, I'm trying to be good
Want me to love you in moderation
Well don't you know, I wish I could

[Chorus]
Then bow your head in the house of God
And little girl, who do you think you are?
You think you need it, you think you want love
You wouldn't want it if you knew what it was
Moderation
Moderation
Moderation

[Bridge]
Girl, you better learn (I just can't win)
How to hold it in (Can't hold it in)
And girl, you better learn (I just can't win)
I just can't win (Can't hold it in)
'Cause I don't see the worth (I just can't win)
I don't see the worth
And I'm still tryna figure out if it
Always, always, always has to hurt

[Outro]
(Ah, ah, ah)

[Outro]
You want love
Moderation
Moderation
Moderation
Moderation[Verse 1]
And it's my own heart
Weighed and measured inside
And it's an old scar
Trying to bleach it out
And it's my own heart
Deemed and delivered a crime
I'm on trial, waiting 'til the beat comes out
I'm on trial, waiting 'til the beat comes out

[Pre-Chorus]
Who's a heretic now?
Am I making sense?
How can you make it stick?
Waiting 'til the beat comes out
Who's a heretic, child?
Can you make it stick, now?
And I'm on trial
Waiting 'til the beat comes out

[Chorus]
I'm miles away, he's on my mind
I'm getting tired of crawling all the way
I've had enough, it's obvious
And I'm getting tired of crawling all the way
Crawling all the way
Crawling all the way

[Post-Chorus]
I'm not beaten by this yet
You can't tell me to regret
Been in the dark since the day we met
Fire, help me to forget
I'm not beaten by this yet
You can't tell me to regret
Been in the dark since the day we met
Fire, help me to forget

[Verse 2]
And it's my own heart
While tried and tested, it's mine
And it's my own heart
Trying to reach it out
And it's my own heart
Burned but not buried this time
I'm on trial, waiting 'til the beat comes out
I'm on trial, waiting 'til the beat comes out

[Chorus]
I'm miles away, he's on my mind
I'm getting tired of crawling all the way
I've had enough, it's obvious
And I'm getting tired of crawling all the way

[Post-Chorus]
I'm not beaten by this yet
You can't tell me to regret
Been in the dark since the day we met
Fire, help me to forget
I'm not beaten by this yet
You can't tell me to regret
Been in the dark since the day we met
Fire, help me to forget

[Outro]
Chained and shackled, oh
I'll unravel, oh
It's a pity, oh
Never to return
But I never learn
It's a pity, oh
Chained and shackled, oh
I'll unravel, oh
It's a pity, oh
Say I won't return
But I never learn
It's a pity, oh
Ooh...[Verse 1]
And the crown, it weighs heavy
'Til it's banging on my eyelids
Retreating in covers and closing the curtains
One thing's for certain, oh
A year like this passes so strangely
Somewhere between sorrow and bliss

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Oh, who decides from where up high?
I couldn't say "I need more time"
Oh, grant that I can stay the night
Or one more day inside this life

[Chorus]
Too much, too much, too much, too much, too much
Never enough
Too much, too much, too much, too much, too much
Never enough
Too much, too much, too much, too much, too much
Never enough
Too much, too much, too much, too much, too much
Never, never, ever enough

[Verse 2]
Oh, you wondrous creature
Coming up who we are
'Cause I'm retreating in covers and closing the curtains
One thing's for certain, oh
A year like this passes so strangely
Somewhere between sorrow and bliss

[Pre-Chorus 2]
And who decides from where up high?
(What happened here? A hundred flags flying in a field)
I couldn't say "I need more time"
([They all called my name?], felt it let go of me)
Oh, grant that I can stay the night
(What happened here? A hundred flags flying in a field)
Or one more day inside this life
([They all called my name?], felt it let go of me)

[Chorus]
Too much, too much, too much, too much, too much
Never enough
Too much, too much, too much, too much, too much
Never enough
Too much, too much, too much, too much, too much
Never enough
Too much, too much, too much, too much, too much
Never, never, ever enough

[Bridge]
And who cares about the thing I did that night?
So what? Maybe Luna had it right
And who cares if I'm coming back alive?
So what? 'Least I have the strength to fight

[Chorus]
Too much, too much, too much, too much, too much
Never enough
Too much, too much, too much, too much, too much
Never enough
Too much, too much, too much, too much, too much
Never enough
Too much, too much, too much, too much, too much
Never, never, ever enough

[Outro]
What happened here? A hundred flags flying in a field
[They all called my name?], felt it let go of me
What happened here? A hundred flags flying in a field
[They all called my name?], felt it let go of me
A hundred flags flying in a field
[They all called my name?], felt it let go of me
What happened here? A hundred flags flying in a field
[They all called my name?], felt it let go of me[Verse 1]
The looking glass, so shiny and new
How quickly the glamour fades
I start spinning, slipping out of time
Was that the wrong pill to take? (Raise it up)

You made a deal, and now it seems you have to offer up
But will it ever be enough? (Raise it up, raise it up)
It's not enough (Raise it up, raise it up)

Here I am, a rabbit-hearted girl
Frozen in the headlights
It seems I've made the final sacrifice

[Pre-Chorus]
We raise it up, this offering
We raise it up

[Chorus]
This is a gift, it comes with a price
Who is the lamb and who is the knife?
Midas is king and he holds me so tight
And turns me to gold in the sunlight

[Verse 2]
I look around, but I can't find you (raise it up)
If only I could see your face (raise it up)
Instead of rushing towards the skyline (raise it up)
I wish that I could just be brave

I must become a lion-hearted girl
Ready for a fight
Before I make the final sacrifice

[Pre-Chorus]
We raise it up, this offering
We raise it up

[Chorus]
This is a gift, it comes with a price
Who is the lamb and who is the knife?
Midas is king and he holds me so tight
And turns me to gold in the sunlight

[Bridge]
Raise it up, raise it up
Raise it up, raise it up
And in the spring I shed my skin
And it blows away with the changing wind
The waters turn from blue to red
As towards the sky I offer it

[Chorus]
This is a gift, it comes with a price
Who is the lamb and who is the knife?
Midas is king and he holds me so tight
And turns me to gold in the sunlight

[Chorus]
This is a gift, it comes with a price
Who is the lamb and who is the knife?
Midas is king and he holds me so tight
And turns me to gold in the sunlight

[Chorus]
This is a gift, it comes with a price
Who is the lamb and who is the knife?
Midas is king and he holds me so tight
And turns me to gold in the sunlight

[Outro]
This is a gift[Verse 1]
She told me not to step on the cracks
I told her not to fuss and relax
Well, her pretty little face stopped me in my tracks

[Chorus 1]
But now she sleeps with one eye open
That's the price she'll pay

[Verse 2]
I took a knife and cut out her eye
I took it home and watched it wither and die
Well, she's lucky that I didn't slip her a smile

[Chorus 1]
Thats why she sleeps with one eye open, oh
But that's the price she'll pay

[Chorus 2]
I said, hey, girl with one eye
Get your filthy fingers out of my pie
I said, hey, girl with one eye
I'll cut your little heart out cause you made me cry

[Verse 3]
I slipped my hand under her skirt
I said don't worry, it's not gonna hurt
Oh, my reputation's kind of clouded with dirt

[Chorus 1]
Thats why you sleep with one eye open
But that's the price you'll pay

[Chorus 2]
I said, hey, girl with one eye
Get your filthy fingers out of my pie
I said, hey, girl with one eye
I'll cut your little heart out cause you made me cry

[Bridge]
You made me cry
You made me cry
You made me cry

[Chorus 2]
I said, hey, girl with one eye
Get your filthy fingers out of my pie
I said, girl with one eye
Get your filthy fingers out of my pie
And I said, hey, girl with one eye
Get your filthy fingers out of my pie
And I said, hey, girl with one eye
I'll cut your little heart out cause you made me cry[Intro]
Oh Lord, won't you leave me
Leave me on my knees?
'Cause I belong to the ground now
And it belongs to me
And oh Lord, won't you leave me
Leave me just like this?
'Cause I belong to the ground now
I want no more than this

[Verse 1]
How I long for the autumn
The sun keeps burning me
Every stone in this city keeps reminding me, oh
Can you protect me from what I want?
The lover I let in who left me so lost

[Chorus 1]
Mother, make me
Make me a big tall tree
So I can shed my leaves and let it blow through me
Mother, make me
Make me a big grey cloud
So I can rain on you things I can't say out loud

[Verse 2]
All these couples are kissing
And I can't stand the heat
I lost my shoes and left the party
I wandered in the street

I put my feet into the fountain
The statues all asleep
No use wishing on the water
It grants you no relief

[Chorus 2]
Mother, make me
Make me a bird of prey
So I can rise above this, let it fall away
Mother, make me
Make me a song so sweet
Heaven trembles, falling at my feet

[Outro]
Oh Lord, won't you leave me
Leave me on my knees?
'Cause I belong to the ground now
And it belongs to me
And oh Lord, won't you leave me
Leave me just like this?
'Cause I belong to the ground now
I want no more than this

Oh Lord, won't you leave me
Leave me on my knees?
'Cause I belong to the ground now
And it belongs to me
And oh Lord, won't you leave me
Leave me just like this?
'Cause I belong to the ground now
I want no more than this[Verse 1]
When we first came here
We were cold and we were clear
With no colours on our skin
We were light and paper thin

And when we first came here
We were cold and we were clear
With no colours in our skin
Until we let the spectrum in

[Pre-Chorus]
Say my name
And every colour illuminates
We are shining
And we will never be afraid again

[Chorus]
Say my name
As every colour illuminates
We are shining
And we will never be afraid again
Say my name
As every colour illuminates
We are shining
And we will never be afraid again

[Verse 2]
And when we come for you
We'll be dressed up all in blue
With the ocean in our arms
Kiss your eyes and kiss your palms

And when it's time to pray
We'll be dressed up all in grey
With metal on our tongues
And silver in our lungs

[Pre-Chorus]
Say my name
And every colour illuminates
We are shining
And we will never be afraid again

[Chorus]
Say my name
As every colour illuminates
We are shining
And we will never be afraid again
Say my name
As every colour illuminates
We are shining
And we will never be afraid again

[Bridge]
And when we come back we'll be dressed in black
And you'll scream our names aloud
And we won't eat and we won't sleep
We'll drag bodies from the ground

So say my name
And every colour illuminates
And we are shining
And we will never be afraid again
Say my name
As every colour illuminates

[Chorus]
Say my name
As every colour illuminates
We are shining
And we will never be afraid again
Say my name
As every colour illuminates
We are shining
And we will never be afraid again

[Outro]
Say my name
We are shining
Say my name
Say my name
And we will never be afraid again[Verse 1]
And I came to, walking on the train tracks
How did I get here? And how do I get back?
I've been up all night, let's stay awake
Push it further, you know I'll never break
At some point in the party, I thought my heart was failing
You said, "Hey, you're okay; you seem to be still standing"
Flashes appeared at the corner of my eyes
I saw the stars and I didn't ask why
Heard the voices and caught my breath
So close and yet so far from death
So close and yet so far from death
So close and yet so far from death

[Pre-Chorus]
Well, the feeling was always too much for me
It always came too strong
I wanted to get it right so badly that I always got it wrong
So you keep pushing on
You hope it won't be long
'Til you can find the child you were
And find a way to get along

[Chorus]
Don't go blindly into the dark
In every one of us shines the light of love
Don't go blindly into the dark
In every one of us shines the light of love
Don't go blindly into the dark
In every one of us shines the light of love
Don't go blindly into the dark
In every one of us shines the light of love

[Verse 2]
And, oh, my little sister, when the drugs were wearing off
I climbed into your bed and said, "I think I did too much"
In some ways that was simpler, being too fucked up to see
I didn't have to wake up to the world that was around me
And now we are awake and it seems too much to take
I want to close my eyes because I fear my heart will break
I want to look away
I want to look away
I want to look away
I must not look away

[Chorus]
Don't go blindly into the dark
In every one of us shines the light of love
Don't go blindly into the dark
In every one of us shines the light of love
Don't go blindly into the dark
In every one of us shines the light of love
Don't go blindly into the dark
In every one of us shines the light of love

[Bridge]
Na-na-na-na, na-na-na-ah
Na-na-na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na, na-na-na-ah
Na-na-na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na, na-na-na-ah
Na-na-na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na, na-na-na-ah
Na-na-na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na, na-na-na-ah

[Outro]
I want to look away
I want to look away
I want to look away
I must not look away
I must not look away
I must not look away
I must not look away
I must not look away[Verse 1]
It's the hardest thing I've ever had to do
To try and keep from calling you
Well, can my dreams keep coming true?
How can they?
'Cause when I sleep, I never dream of you

[Pre-Chorus 1]
As if the dream of you, it sleeps too
But it never slips away
It just gains its strength and digs its hooks
To drag me through the day

[Chorus]
And I'm caught
I forget all that I've been taught
I can't keep calm, I can't keep still
Pulled apart against my will

[Verse 2]
It's the hardest thing I've ever had to prove
You turned to salt as I turned around to look at you
Old friends have said, the books I've read
Say it's the thing to do
But it's hard to see it when you're in it
'Cause I went blind for you

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Then you leave my head, crawl out the bed
You subconscious solipsist
And for those hours deep in the dark
Perhaps you don't exist

[Chorus]
But I'm caught
I forget all that I've been taught
I can't keep calm, I can't keep still
Pulled apart against my will

[Bridge]
And I'm thrashing on the line
Somewhere between
Desperate and divine
I can't keep calm, I can't keep still
Persephone will have her fill

[Chorus]
And I'm caught
I forget all that I've been taught
I can't keep calm, I can't keep still
Pulled apart against my will

And I'm caught
I forget all that I've been taught
I can't keep calm, I can't keep still
Pulled apart against my will[Verse 1]
If you could only see the beast you've made of me
I held it in, but now it seems you've set it running free
Screaming in the dark, I howl when we're apart
Drag my teeth across your chest to taste your beating heart
My fingers claw your skin, try to tear my way in
You are the moon that breaks the night for which I have to howl
My fingers claw your skin, try to tear my way in
You are the moon that breaks the night for which I have to

[Hook]
Howl, howl
Howl, howl

[Verse 2]
Now there's no holding back, I'm making to attack
My blood is singing with your voice, I want to pour it out
The saints can't help me now, the ropes have been unbound
I hunt for you with bloody feet across the hallowed ground
Like some child, possessed, the beast howls in my veins
I want to find you, tear out all your tenderness and

[Hook]
Howl, howl
Howl, howl

[Chorus 1]
Be careful of the curse that falls on young lovers
Starts so soft and sweet, and turns them to hunters

[Bridge]
(Hunters, hunters)
(Hunters, hunters)
(Hunters, hunters)
(Hunters, hunters)

[Verse 3]
The fabric of your flesh, pure as a wedding dress
Until I wrap myself inside your arms, I cannot rest
The saints can't help me now, the ropes have been unbound
I hunt for you with bloody feet across the hallowed ground
And howl, howl

[Chorus 1]
Be careful of the curse that falls on young lovers
Starts so soft and sweet, and turns them to hunters
A man who's pure of heart and says his prayers by night
May still become a wolf when the autumn moon is bright

[Outro]
If you could only see the beast you've made of me
I held it in, but now it seems you've set it running free
The saints can't help me now, the ropes have been unbound
I hunt for you with bloody feet across the hallowed ground[Verse 1]
A tornado flew around my room before you came
Excuse the mess it made, it usually doesn't rain in
Southern California, much like Arizona
My eyes don't shed tears, but boy, they pour when

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm thinkin' 'bout you, ooh no, no, no
I've been thinkin' bout you, you know, know, know
I've been thinkin' bout you, do you think about me still?
Do ya, do ya?

[Chorus]
Or do you not think so far ahead?
'Cause I been thinkin' bout forever, ooh
Or do you not think so far ahead?
'Cause I been thinkin' bout forever, ooh

[Verse 2]
No, I don't like you, I just thought you were cool enough to kick it
Got a beach house I could sell you in Idaho
Since you think I don't love you, I just thought you were cute
That's why I kissed you
Got a fighter jet, I don't get to fly it though, I'm lying down

[Pre-Chorus]
Thinkin' 'bout you, ooh no, no, no
I've been thinkin' bout you, you know, know, know
I've been thinkin' bout you, do you think about me still?
Do ya, do ya?

[Chorus]
Or do you not think so far ahead?
'Cause I been thinkin' bout forever, ooh
Or do you not think so far ahead?
'Cause I been thinkin' bout forever, ooh

[Bridge]
Yes, of course, I remember, how could I forget (How could I forget?) how you feel? (How you feel)
You know you were my first time, a new feel
It won't ever get old, not in my soul, not in my spirit, keep it alive
We'll go down this road 'til it turns from color to black and white

[Chorus]
Or do you not think so far ahead?
'Cause I been thinkin' bout forever, ooh
Or do you not think so far ahead?
'Cause I been thinkin' bout forever, ooh[Part I]

[Verse 1]
Round your city, round the clock
Everybody needs you
No, you can't make everybody equal
Although you got beaucoup family
You don't even got nobody bein' honest with you
Breathe 'til I evaporated
My whole body see through
Transportation, handmade (G)
And I know it better than most people
I don't trust 'em anyways
You can't break the law with them
Get some gushy, have a calm night
Shooters killin' left and right
Workin' through your worst night
If I get my money right
You know I won't need you
And I tell you, (bitch)
I hope the sack is full up
I'm fuckin', no, I'm fucked up
Spend it when I get that
I ain't tryna keep you
Can't keep up a conversation
Can't nobody reach you
Why your eyes well up?
Did you call me from a sance?
You are from my past life
Hope you're doin' well, bruh
I been out here head first
Always like the head first
Signal comin' in and out
Hope you're doin' well, bruh
Everybody needs you, everybody needs you
Oooh, nani nani
This feel like a quaalude
No sleep in my body
Ain't no bitch in my body

[Pre-Chorus]
New beginnin's, ahh
New beginnin's, wake up akh
The sun's goin' down
Time to start your day, bruh
Can't keep bein' laid off
Know you need the money if you gon' survive
The every night shit, every day shit

[Chorus]
Droppin' baby off at home before my night shift
You know I can't hear none of that spend the night shit
That kumbaya shit
Wanna see nirvana, but don't wanna die yet
Wanna feel that na na though, could you come by?
Fuck with me after my shift
Know them boys wanna see me broke down and shit
Bummed out and shit, stressed out and shit
That's every day shit
Shut the fuck up, I dont want your conversation
Rollin' marijuana, that's a cheap vacation
My every day shit, every night shit, my every day shit
(Every night shit, night shit, night shit, night shit)

[Bridge]
All my night, been ready for you all my night
Been waitin' on you all my night
I'll buzz you in, just let me know when you outside
All my night, you been missin' all my night
Still got some good nights memorized
And the look back's gettin' me right

[Part II]

[Verse 2]
Every night fucks every day up
Every day patches the night up
On God, you should match it, it's that KO
No white lighters 'til I fuck my 28th up
1998, my family had that Acura
Oh, the Legend
Kept at least six discs in the changer
Back when Boswell and Percy had it active
Couple bishops in the city buildin' mansions
All the reverends
Preachin' self made millionaire status
When we could only eat at Shoney's on occasion
After 'trina hit I had to transfer campus
Your apartment out in Houston's where I waited
Stayin' with you when I didn't have a address
Fuckin' on you when I didn't own a mattress
Workin' on a way to make it outta Texas, every night

[Chorus]
Droppin' baby off at home before my night shift, yeah
You know I can't hear none of that spend the night shit
That kumbaya shit
Want to see nirvana, but don't wanna die yet
Wanna feel that na na though, could you come by
Fuck with me after my shift
Know them boys wanna see me broke down
See me bummed out, stressed out
That's just everyday shit
Shut the fuck up, I don't want your conversation
Rollin' marijuana, that's a cheap vacation
My every day shit, my every day shit
My every night shit, my every day shit
My every day shit, my every day shit
My every day shit, my every night shit[Intro: Frank Ocean]
And the peaches and the mangos
That you could sell for me

[Verse 1: Frank Ocean]
What do you think my brain is made for
Is it just a container for the mind?
This great grey matter
Sensei replied, "What is your woman?
Is she just a container for the child?"
That soft pink matter
Cotton candy, Majin Buu, oh, oh, ohh
Close my eyes and fall into you, you, you
My God, she's giving me pleasure

[Verse 2: Frank Ocean]
What if the sky and the stars are for show
And the aliens are watching live
From the purple matter?
Sensei went quiet then violent
And we sparred until we both grew tired
Nothing mattered
Cotton candy, Majin Buu, oh, oh, oh, oh
Dim the lights and fall into you, you, you
My God, giving me pleasure
Pleasure, pleasure, pleasure
Pleasure over matter

[Verse 3: Andr 3000]
Hey, hey
Since you been gone, I been having withdrawals
You were such a habit to call
I ain't myself at all, had to tell myself, "Naw
She better with some fella with a regular job"
I didn't wanna get her involved
By dinner Mr. Benjamin was sitting in awe
Hopped into my car; drove far
Far's too close and I remember my memory's no sharp
Butter knife, what a life, anyway
I'm building y'all a clock, stop, what am I, Hemingway?
She had the kind of body that would probably intimidate
Any of 'em that were un-southern, not me, cousin
If models are made for modelin'
Thick girls are made for cuddlin'
Switch worlds and we can huddle then
Who needs another friend? I need to hold your hand
You'd need no other man, we'd flee to other lands

[Bridge: Frank Ocean]
Grey matter
Blue used to be my favorite color
Now I ain't got no choice
Blue matter

[Outro: Andr 3000]
You're good at being bad, you're bad at being good
For heaven's sakes, go to hell, nah, knock on wood, hey
You're good at being bad (You're bad at being good)
For heaven's sakes, go to hell
For heaven's sakes, go to hell
Knock, knock, knock, knock on wood
Well, frankly, when that ocean so mu'fucking good
Make her swab the mu'fucking wood
Make her walk the mu'fucking plank
Make her rob a mu'fucking bank
With no mask on and a rusty revolver[Intro: Frank Ocean]
Poolside convo about your summer last night, ooh yeah
About your summer last night
Ain't give you no play, mm
Could I make you shive last night?
Could I make you shy on the last night, last night?
Could we make it in? Do we have time?

[Verse 1: Frank Ocean]
I'll be the boyfriend in your wet dreams tonight
Noses on a rail, little virgin wears the white
You cut your hair but you used to live a blonded life
Wish I was there, wish we'd grown up on the same advice
And our time was right

[Chorus: Austin Feinstein]
Keep a place for me, for me
I'll sleep between y'all, it's nothing
It's no thing, it's nothing
Keep a place for me, for me

[Verse 2: Frank Ocean]
Now and then you miss it, sounds make you cry
Some nights you dance with tears in your eyes
I came to visit, 'cause you see me like a UFO
That's like never, 'cause I made you use your self-control
And you made me lose my self-control, my self-control

[Chorus: Austin Feinstein & Yung Lean]
Keep a place for me, for me
I'll sleep between y'all, it's no thing
Keep a place for me
It's no thing, it's nothing
It's no thing, it's nothing

[Bridge: Frank Ocean]
Sometimes you'll miss it
And the sound will make you cry
And some nights you're dancing
With tears in your eyes

[Outro: Frank Ocean]
I, I, I know you gotta leave, leave, leave
Take down some summer time
Give us, just tonight, night, night
I, I, I know you got someone comin'
You're spittin' game, know you got it
I, I, I know you gotta leave, leave, leave
Take down some summer time
Give us, just tonight, night, night
I, I, I know you got someone comin'
You're spittin' game, know you got it
(Nobody else, nobody else)
I, I, I know you gotta leave, leave, leave
Take down some summer time
Give us, just tonight, night, night
I, I, I know you got someone comin'
You're spittin' game, know you got it[Part I]

[Hook]
Set the cheetahs on the loose
There's a thief out on the move
Underneath our legion's view
They have taken Cleopatra

[Bridge]
Run run run, come back for my glory
Bring her back to me
Run run run, the crown of our pharaoh
The throne of our queen is empty

[Verse 1]
We'll run to the future, shining like diamonds
In a rocky world, rocky-rocky world
Our skin like bronze and our hair like cashmere
As we march to the rhythm on the palace floor
Chandeliers inside the pyramids, tremble from the force
Cymbals crash inside the pyramids, voices fill up the halls

[Hook]
Set the cheetahs on the loose
There's a thief out on the move
Underneath our legion's view
They have taken Cleopatra, Cleopatra

[Verse 2]
The jewel of Africa, jewel
What good is a jewel that ain't still precious?
How could you run off on me? How could you run off on us?
You feel like God inside that gold
I found you laying down with Samson and his full head of hair
I found my black queen Cleopatra, bad dreams, Cleopatra

[Outro]
Remove her, send the cheetahs to the tomb
Our war is over, our queen has met her doom
No more, she lives no more, serpent in her room
No more, he has killed Cleopatra, Cleopatra

[Part II]

[Segue]
Big sun coming strong through the motel blinds
Wake up to your girl
For now, let's call her Cleopatra, Cleopatra
I watch you fix your hair
Then put your panties on in the mirror, Cleopatra
Then your lipstick, Cleopatra
Then your six-inch heels, catch her
She's headed to the pyramid

[Hook]
She's working at the pyramid tonight
Working at the pyramid
Working at the pyramid tonight
Working at the pyramid
Working at the pyramid tonight
Working at the pyramid
Working at the pyramid tonight
Working at the pyramid
Working at the pyramid tonight

[Verse 1]
Pimping in my convos
Bubbles in my champagne, let it be some jazz playing
Top floor motel suite twisting my cigars
Floor model TV with the VCR
Got rubies in my damn chain
Whip ain't got no gas tank but it still got woodgrain
Got your girl working for me
Hit the strip and my bills paid
That keep my bills paid
Hit the strip and my bills paid
Keep a nigga bills paid

[Hook]
She's working at the pyramid tonight
Working at the pyramid
Working at the pyramid tonight
Working at the pyramid
Working at the pyramid tonight
Working at the pyramid
Working at the pyramid tonight
Working at the pyramid

[Verse 2]
You showed up after work, I'm bathing your body
Touch you in places only I know
You're wet and you're warm just like our bathwater
Can we make love before you go?
The way you say my name makes me feel like
I'm that nigga but I'm still unemployed
You say it's big but you take it, ride cowgirl
But your love ain't free no more, baby
But your love ain't free no more

[Hook]
She's working at the pyramid tonight
Working at the pyramid
Working at the pyramid tonight
Working at the pyramid, that's right
Working at the pyramid tonight, yeah
Working at the pyramid
Working at the pyramid tonight
Working at the pyramid
Working at the pyramid tonight

Air guitar

[Guitar Solo: John Mayer][Verse 1]
My guy pretty like a girl
And he got fight stories to tell
I see both sides like Chanel
See on both sides like Chanel
Swimmin' laps through pool water
Heated like I'm underworld
Hide my tattoos in Shibuya
Police think I'm of the underworld
12 treat a nigga like he twelve
How you lookin' up to me and talkin' down? (Yeah)
Can't you see I am the big man? (Big man)
God level, I am the I am (Woah)
Now film it with that drone cam, in the pink like Killa Cam
Put a zoom on that stick, No, up so close I'm on that kill
Remote controller on your lower back, yes, the good
Dick could roll the eyes back in the skull
Rollin' when you ride, poppin'
Rollin' when you ride, ride the Rodman
Got one that's straight actin'
Turnt out like some dirty plastic (Ride)
2016: burnt some discs (Dope)
2017: ideas playin' off a Walkman
This a cult, not a clique on the net
With a cup in a cup, Actavis
That's a double edge, "issa knife" (Knife)
And I don't like to fight 'til I'm fightin' (Fightin')
Revenge in the air make my lungs sick
Chopper in the sky like a gun trick (Yeah)
Clips on clips like Mike (Hello)
It's really all

[Chorus]
I see both sides like Chanel
See on both sides like Chanel

[Bridge]
It's really you on my mind
It's really you on my mind
It's really you
It's really you on my mind

[Verse 2]
V both sides of the 12
Steam both sides of the L
Freeze smoke rings and they hail
Sleet snow grind for the wealth
Whole team diamonds is real
Showed 'em how to shine by theirselves
You need a cosign for your health
I need that bitch to grind on my belt
I know you need to try for my belt
I know you seen it drivin' itself
No matte black on the ride 'cause it's stale
But it's stealth

[Chorus]
I see both sides like Chanel
I see both sides like Chanel

[Outro]
My pockets snug, they can't hold my 7
They banned my Visa, my Amex and Mastercards
I got new money, and it's all cash
I got new bags, and they all collabs
I rubber band a bunch of thousand-dollar Delta gift cards
(I mean my baby bi)
Amazing, the cash online unknown
(I mean my baby bi)
Blazin' the dash, countin' money at home
My pockets snug, they can't hold my 7
They banned my Visa, my Amex and Mastercards
I got new money, and it's all cash
I got new bags, and they all collabs
I rubber band a bunch of thousand-dollar Delta gift cards
(I mean my baby bi)
Amazing, the cash online unknown
(I mean my baby bi)
Blazin' the dash, countin' money at home[Chorus]
I thought that I was dreamin' when you said you love me
The start of nothin', I had no chance to prepare
I couldn't see you comin'
The start of nothin', ooh, I could hate you now
It's quite alright to hate me now
When we both know that deep down
The feeling still deep down is good

[Verse 1]
If I could see through walls, I could see you're faking
If you could see my thoughts, you would see our faces
Safe in my rental like an armored truck back then
We didn't give a fuck back then
I ain't a kid no more, we'll never be those kids again
We'd drive to Syd's, had the X6 back then, back then
No matter what I did, my waves wouldn't dip back then
Everything sucked back then, we were friends

[Chorus]
I thought that I was dreamin' when you said you love me
The start of nothin', I had no chance to prepare
I couldn't see you comin'
The start of nothin', ooh, I could hate you now
It's quite alright to hate me now
But we both know that deep down
The feeling still deep down is good

[Verse 2]
In the halls of your hotel
Arm around my shoulder so I could tell
How much I meant to you, meant it sincere back then
We had time to kill back then
You ain't a kid no more, we'll never be those kids again
It's not the same, ivory's illegal, don't you remember?

[Bridge]
I broke your heart last week
You'll probably feel better by the weekend
Still remember, had you going crazy
Screamin' my name, the feeling deep down is good

[Chorus]
I thought that I was dreamin' when you said you love me
The start of nothin', had no chance to prepare
Couldn't see you comin'
And we started from nothin', ooh, I could hate you now
It's alright to hate me now
We both know that deep down
The feeling still deep down is good

[Outro]
All the things I didn't mean to say, I didn't mean to do
There were things you didn't need to say
Did you mean to? Mean to
I've been dreamin' of you, dreamin' of you
I've been dreamin' of you, dreamin' of you
I've been dreamin', dreaming[Chorus: Frank Ocean]
Too many bottles of this wine we can't pronounce
Too many bowls of that green, no Lucky Charms
The maids come around too much
Parents ain't around enough
Too many joy rides in daddy's Jaguar
Too many white lies and white lines
Super rich kids with nothing but loose ends
Super rich kids with nothing but fake friends

[Verse 1: Frank Ocean]
Start my day up on the roof
There's nothing like this type of view
Point the clicker at the tube
I prefer expensive news
New car, new girl
New ice, new glass
New watch, good times babe
It's good times, yeah
She wash my back three times a day
This shower head feels so amazing
We'll both be high, the help don't stare
They just walk by, they must don't care
A million one, a million two
A hundred more will never do

[Chorus: Frank Ocean]
Too many bottles of this wine we can't pronounce
Too many bowls of that green, no Lucky Charms
The maids come around too much
Parents ain't around enough
Too many joy rides in daddy's Jaguar
Too many white lies and white lines
Super rich kids with nothing but loose ends
Super rich kids with nothing but fake friends

[Bridge: Frank Ocean]
Real love, I'm searching for a real love
Oh, real love, I'm searching for a real love
Oh, real love

[Verse 2: Earl Sweatshirt]
Close your eyes to what you can't imagine
We are the Xanny-gnashing
Caddy-smashing, bratty ass
He mad, he snatched his daddy's Jag
And used that shit for batting practice
Adamant and he thrashing
Purchasing crappy grams with half the hand of cash you handed
Panic and patch me up
Pappy done latch-keyed us
Toying with Raggy Anns and Mammy done had enough
Brash as fuck, breachin' all these aqueducts
Don't believe us
Treat us like we can't erupt, yup

[Alternate Verse 2: Frank Ocean]
Polo sweats and Hermes blankets
Them label hoes be stealing my shit
And all they clothes revealing they tits
Pills, high enough to touch the rim in that bitch
We party in my living room
'Cause father is gone
And he left me this empire
That runs on its own
So all I got to do is whatever the fuck I want
All we ever do is whatever the fuck we want

[Verse 3: Frank Ocean]
We end our day up on the roof
I say I'll jump, I never do
But when I'm drunk I act a fool
Talking 'bout, do they sew wings on tailored suits
I'm on that ledge, she grabs my arm
She slaps my hand
It's good times, yeah
Sleeve rips off, I slip, I fall
The market's down like 60 stories
And some don't end the way they should
My silver spoon has fed me good
A million one, a million cash
Close my eyes and feel the crash

[Chorus: Frank Ocean]
Too many bottles of this wine we can't pronounce
Too many bowls of that green, no Lucky Charms
The maids come around too much
Parents ain't around enough
Too many joy rides in daddy's Jaguar
Too many white lies and white lines
Super rich kids with nothing but loose ends
Super rich kids with nothing but fake friends

[Outro]
Real love, ain't that something rare
I'm searching for a real love, talking 'bout real love
Real love, yeah
Real love
I'm searching for a real love
Talkin' 'bout a real love[Verse 1: Frank Ocean]
These bitches want Nikes
They looking for a check
Tell 'em it ain't likely
Said she need a ring like Carmelo
You must be on that white like Othello
All you want is Nikes
But the real ones just like you, just like me
I don't play, I don't make time
But if you need dick I got you
And I yam from the line
Pour up for A$AP, R.I.P. Pimp C
RIP Trayvon, that nigga look just like me
Woo, fuckin' buzzin', woo!
That my little cousin, he got a little trade
His girl keep the scales, a little mermaid
We out by the pool, some little mermaids
Me and them gel
Like twigs with them bangs
Now that's a real mermaid
You been holding your breath, weighted down
Punk madre, punk papa
He don't care for me, but he cares for me
And that's good enough
We don't talk much or nothin'
But when we talkin' about something
We have good discussion
I met his friends last week
Feels like they're up to somethin'
That's good for us

[Verse 2: Frank Ocean]
We'll let you guys prophesy
We'll let you guys prophesy
We gon' see the future first
We'll let you guys prophesy
We gon' see the future first
Living so the last night feels like a past life
Speaking of the, don't know what got into people
Devil be possessin' homies
Demons try to body jump
Why you think I'm in this bitch wearing a fucking Yarmulke?
Acid on me like the rain
Weed crumbles into glitter
Rain, glitter
We laid out on this wet floor
Away turf, no Astro
Mesmerized how the strobes glow
Look at all the people feet dance
I know that your nigga came with you
But he ain't with you
We only human and it's humid in these Balmains
I mean my balls sticking to my jeans
We breathin' pheremones, Amber Rose
Sippin' pink-gold lemonades
Feelin'

[Bridge: Frank Ocean]
I may be younger but I'll look after you
We're not in love but I'll make love to you
When you're not here I'll save some for you
I'm not him but I'll mean something to you
I'll mean something to you
I'll mean something to you
You got a roommate, he'll hear what we do
It's only awkward if you're fucking him too

[Verse 3: KOHH]

Double D
Big full breasts on my baby
(Yo we going to Florida)
Triple weight
Couldn't weigh the love I've got for the girl
And I just wanna know
Why you ain't been going to work
Boss ain't working you like this
He can't take care of you like this

[Chorus]
Now you're lost, lost in the heat of it all
Girl, you know you're lost
Lost in the thrill of it all
Miami, Amsterdam, Tokyo, Spain, lost
Los Angeles, India, lost on a train, lost

[Verse 2]
Got on my buttercream silk shirt and it's Versace
(There he goes, one of God's own prototypes)
Hand me my triple weight
So I can weigh the work I got on your girl
(Too weird to live, too rare to die)
No I don't really wish
I don't wish the titties would show
Nor have I ever, have I ever let you get caught?

[Chorus]
Lost, lost in the heat of it all
Girl, you know you're lost
Lost in the thrill of it all
Miami, Amsterdam, Tokyo, Spain, lost
Los Angeles, India, lost on a train, lost

[Bridge]
She's at a stove (Who)
Can't believe I got her out here cooking dope (Cooking dope)
I promise she'll be whipping meals up for a family of her own some day
Nothing wrong (Nothing wrong)
No, nothing wrong (Ain't nothing wrong) with a lie (Ooh)
Nothing wrong (Nothing wrong)
With another short plane ride (Ain't nothing wrong)
Through the sky (Up in the sky)
You and I (Just you and I)

[Chorus]
Lost, lost in the heat of it all
Girl, you know you're lost
Lost in the thrill of it all
Miami, Amsterdam, Tokyo, Spain, lost
Los Angeles, India, lost on a train, lost

Love lost, lost? Love, love
Love lost, lost? Love, love
Love lost, love love, love lost

Taxi driver
Be my shrink for the hour
Leave the meter running
It's rush hour
So take the streets if you wanna
Just outrun the demons, could you?

[Chorus]
He said "Allahu akbar"
I told him, "Don't curse me"
"Bo Bo, you need prayer"
I guess it couldn't hurt me
If it brings me to my knees, it's a bad religion, ooh
This unrequited love
To me, it's nothin' but a one-man cult
And cyanide in my styrofoam cup
I can never make him love me
Never make him love me
Love me, love me
Love me, love me
Love me, love me
Love me, love me
Love me, love

[Verse 2]
Taxi driver
I swear I've got three lives
Balanced on my head like steak knives
I can't tell you the truth about my disguise
I can't trust no one

[Chorus]
And you say "Allahu akbar"
I told him, "Don't curse me"
"Bo Bo, you need prayer"
I guess it couldn't hurt me
If it brings me to my knees, it's a bad religion
Oh, unrequited love
To me, it's nothin' but a one-man cult
And cyanide in my styrofoam cup
I can never make him love me
Never make him love me
No, no, ahh

[Outro]
It's a, it's a bad religion
To be in love with someone
Who could never love you
Oh-oh-oh, only bad, only bad religion
Could have me feeling the way I do[Verse 1]
I think I started something, I got what I wanted
Did-didn't I can't feel nothing, superhuman
Even when I'm fucking, Viagra popping
Every single record, autotuning
Zero emotion, muted emotion
Pitch corrected, computed emotion, uh-huh
I blame it on the model broad with the Hollywood smile, ow
Stripper booty and a rack like wow, Brain like Berkeley
Met her at Coachella
I went to see Jigga, she went to see Z Trip, perfect
I took a seat on the ice cold lawn
She handed me a ice blue bong, whatever
She said she wanna be a dentist really badly
She's in school paying
For tuition, doing porn in the Valley, at least you workin'
But, girl, I can't feel my face
What are we smoking anyway?
She said "don't let the high go to waste"
But can you taste a little taste

[Hook]
Novacane, baby, baby
Novacane, baby, I want you
Fuck me good, fuck me long, fuck me numb
Love me now, when I'm gone, love me none
Love me none, love me none
Numb, numb, numb, numb

[Verse 2]
Sink full of dishes, pacin' in the kitchen, cocaine for breakfast, yikes
Bed full of women, flip on a tripod, little red light on shootin'
I'm feelin' like Stanley Kubrick, this is some visionary shit
Been tryna film pleasure with my eyes wide shut but it keeps on movin'
I blame it on the model broad with the Hollywood smile
Stripper booty with a rack like wow, I'll never forget ya
You put me on a feelin' I never had, never had, never had (Never)
And ever since I've been tryna get it back, and pick it up and put it back
Now I'm something like the chemist on campus
But there's no drug around quite like what I found in you, you
I still can't feel my face
What am I smokin' anyway? (Ahh)
She said, "Don't let the high go to waste" (Ooh)
But can you taste a little taste of

[Hook]
Novacane, baby, baby (Ohh)
Novacane, baby, I want you
Fuck me good, fuck me long, fuck me numb
Love me now, when I'm gone, love me none
Love me none, love me none, numb, numb, numb, numb

[Bridge]
Novacane, novacane, novacane, novacane, novacane (Ohh)
Numb the pain, numb the pain, numb the pain, numb the pain, numb the pain (Ohh, ohh)
Novacane, novacane, novacane, novacane, novacane
For the pain, for the pain (Ohh, ohh, ohh)
Novacane, novacane (Ooh)

[Outro]
Pretty girls involved with me
Making pretty love to me, pretty, pity pity
All the pretty girls involved with me
Making pretty love to me, pretty, pity pity
I can't feel a thing, can't feel, can't feel a thing
Can't feel a thing, can't feel, feel, feel, feel her
Can't feel, feel her
Novacane, novacane, novacane
I can't feel her
Novacane for the pain, for the pain
Can't, can't feel her, feel her, feel her
Novacane, novacane-cane[Intro]
Yeah, yeah (woo!)
Yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse 1]
That's the way every day goes
Every time we've no control
If the sky is pink and white
If the ground is black and yellow
It's the same way you showed me
Nod my head, don't close my eyes
Halfway on a slow move
It's the same way you showed me
If you could fly, then you'd feel south
Up north's getting cold soon
The way it is, we're on land
Still I'm someone to hold true
Keep you cool when it's still alive
Won't let you down when it's all ruin

[Chorus]
Just the same way you showed me, showed me
You showed me love
Glory from above
Regard, my dear
It's all downhill from here

[Verse 2]
In the wake of a hurricane
Dark skin of a summer shade
Nosedive into flood lines
Tall tower of milk crates
It's the same way you showed me
Cannonball off the porch side
Older kids trying off the roof
Just the same way you showed me (You showed)
If you could die and come back to life
Up for air from the swimming pool
You'd kneel down to the dry land
Kiss the Earth that birthed you
Gave you tools just to stay alive
And make it out when the sun is ruined

[Chorus]
That's the same way you showed me, showed me
You showed me love
Glory from above
Regard, my dear
It's all downhill from here

[Outro: Frank Ocean & Beyonc]
Remember life, remember how it was
Climb trees, Michael Jackson, it all ends here
Say what up to Matthew, to Shoob
Say what up to Danny
Say what up to life immortality
Bending up my Nikes
Running out the melpomene, nicotine
Stealing granny cigs (Take it easy)
Gimme something sweet
Bitch, I might like immortality
This is life, life immortality[Intro]
I wanna see your pom poms from the stands
Come on, come on

[Chorus]
My fingertips and my lips
They burn from the cigarettes
Forrest Gump
You run my mind, boy
Running on my mind, boy
Forrest Gump

[Verse 1]
I know you, Forrest
I know you wouldn't hurt a beetle
But you're so buff and so strong
I'm nervous, Forrest
Forrest Gump

[Chorus]
My fingertips and my lips
They burn from the cigarettes
Forrest Gump
You run my mind, boy
Running on my mind, boy
Forrest Gump

[Verse 2]
I saw your game, Forrest
I was screaming, "Run forty-four!"
But you kept running past the end zone
Oh, where'd you go, Forrest?
Forrest Gump

[Chorus]
My fingertips and my lips
They burn from the cigarettes
Forrest Gump
You run my mind, boy
Running on my mind, boy
Forrest Gump

[Outro]
Forrest green, Forrest blues
I'm remembering you
If this is love, I know it's true
I won't forget you
(You, you, oh, you, you)
It's for you, Forrest
(You, you, oh, you, you)
It's for you, Forrest
Forrest Gump[Verse 1]
Bad luck to talk on these rides
Mind on the road, your dilated eyes watch the clouds float
White Ferrari, had a good time
(Sweet 16, how was I supposed to know anything?)
I let you out at Central
I didn't care to state the plain
Kept my mouth closed, we're both so familiar
White Ferrari, good times

[Verse 2]
Stick by me, close by me
You were fine, you were fine here
That's just a slow body
You left when I forgot to speak
So I text the speech, lesser speeds, Texas speed, yes
Basic takes its toll on me, 'ventually, 'ventually, yes
Ahh, on me 'ventually, 'ventually, yes

[Verse 3]
I care for you still and I will forever
That was my part of the deal, honest
We got so familiar
Spending each day of the year
White Ferrari, good times
In this life (life), in this life (life)
One too many years
Some tattooed eyelids on a facelift
(Thought you might want to know now)
Mind over matter is magic, I do magic
If you think about it, it'll be over in no time
And that's life

[Verse 4]
I'm sure we're taller in another dimension
You say we're small and not worth the mention
Youre tired of movin', your body's achin'
We could vacay, there's places to go
Clearly this isn't all that there is
Can't take what's been given
But we're so okay here, we're doing fine
Primal and naked
You dream of walls that hold us in prison
It's just a skull, least that's what they call it
And we're free to roam[Verse 1]
Hand me a towel, I'm dirty dancing by myself
Gone off tabs of that acid
Form me a circle, watch my Jagger
Might lose my jacket and hit a solo, one time
We too loud in public, them police turned down the function
Now we outside and the timing's perfect
Forgot to tell you, gotta tell you how much I vibe with you
And we don't gotta be solo
Now stay away from highways
My eyes like them red lights
Right now I prefer yellow
Redbone, so mellow
Fuck 'round, be cutting you
Think we were better off solo
I got that act right in the Windy City that night
No trees to blow through but blow me and I owe you
Two grams when the sun rise
Smoking good, rolling solo
Solo (solo), solo (solo)
S-solo (solo), s-solo, (solo)

[Chorus]
It's hell on Earth and the city's on fire
Inhale, in hell there's heaven
There's a bull and a matador dueling in the sky
Inhale, in hell there's heaven
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Solo, solo, solo, solo

[Verse 2]
I'm skipping showers and switching socks, sleeping good and long
Bones feeling dense as fuck, wish a nigga would cross
And catch a solo, on time
White leaf on my boxers, green leaf turn to vapors for the low
And that mean cheap, 'cause ain't shit free and I know it
Even love ain't, 'cause this nut cost, that clinic killed my soul
But you gotta hit the pussy raw though
Now your baby momma ain't so vicious
All she want is her picket fence
And you protest and you picket sign
But them courts won't side with you
Won't let you fly solo
I wanted that act right in Colorado that night
I brought trees to blow through, but it's just me and no you
Stayed up 'til my phone died, smoking big, rolling solo

[Chorus]
It's hell on Earth and the city's on fire
Inhale, in hell there's heaven
There's a bull and a matador dueling in the sky
Inhale, in hell there's heaven
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Solo, solo, solo, solo

[Outro]
By myself
Solo, solo, solo, solo
(By myself, by myself)
(Solo)[Verse 1]
That's a pretty big trunk on my Lincoln town car, ain't it?
Big enough to take these broken hearts and put 'em in it
Now I'm drivin' 'round on the boulevard, trunk bleedin'
And every time the cops pull me over, they don't ever see them
They never see them

[Pre-Chorus]
And I've got this black suit on
Roamin' around like I'm ready for a funeral
Five more miles 'til the road runs out

[Chorus]
I'm about to drive in the ocean
I'ma try to swim from somethin' bigger than me
Kick off my shoes and swim good, and swim good
Take off this suit and swim good, and swim good, good

[Verse 2]
Got some pretty good beats on this 808 CD, yeah
Memory seats I'm sittin' on stay heated
I woulda put tints on my windows but what's the difference?
If I feel like a Ghost, no Swayze
Ever since I lost my baby

[Pre-Chorus]
I've had this black suit on
Roamin' around like I'm ready for a funeral
One more mile 'til the road runs out

[Chorus]
I'm about to drive in the ocean
I'ma try to swim from somethin' bigger than me
Kick off my shoes and swim good, and swim good
Take off this suit and swim good, and swim good, good

[Bridge]
I'm goin' off (Oh, my pretty love)
Don't try stopping me
I'm goin' off (Throw me a line)
Don't try saving (Broke my heart)
No flares (Broke my heart)
No vest (Drove my love)
And no fear
Waves are washin' me out

[Chorus]
I'm about to drive in the ocean
I'ma try to swim from somethin' bigger than me
Kick off my shoes and swim good, and swim good
Take off this suit and swim good, and swim good, good

[Outro]
Don't die[Verse 1]
The markings on your surface
Your speckled face
Flawed crystals hang from your ears
I couldn't gauge your fears
I can't relate to my peers
I'd rather live outside
I'd rather chip my pride than lose my mind out here
Maybe I'm a fool
Maybe I should move and settle
Two kids and a swimming pool
I'm not brave (brave)
I'm not brave

[Verse 2]
I'm living over city
And taking in the homeless sometimes
Been living in an idea
An idea from another man's mind
Maybe I'm a fool
To settle for a place with some nice views
Maybe I should move, settle down
Two kids and a swimming pool
I'm not brave
I'd rather live outside
I'd rather live outside
I'd rather go to jail
I've tried hell (It's a loop)
What would you recommend I do?
(And the other side of the loop is a loop)
This, this fe-, this feel
This feel, this feels
This feels how molly must feel
This feels how molly must feel
How molly must feel, this feels how molly must feel
How molly must feel

[Bridge]
This is not my life
It's just a fond farewell to a friend
It's just a fond farewell to a friend
This is not my life
It's just a fond farewell to a friend
It's not what I'm like
It's just a fond farewell (brave)

[Verse 3]
Speaking of Nirvana, it was there
Rare as the feathers on my dash from a phoenix
There with my crooked teeth and companion sleeping, yeah
Dreaming a thought that could dream about a thought
That could think of the dreamer that thought
That could think of dreaming and getting a glimmer of God
I be dreaming of dreaming a thought
That could dream about a thought
That could think of dreaming a dream
Where I cannot, where I cannot

[Verse 4]
Less morose and more present
Dwell on my gifts for a second, a moment
One solar flare, we're consumed
So why not spend this flammable paper on the film that's my life?
High flights, inhale the vapor, exhale once and think twice
Eat some shrooms, maybe have a good cry about you
See some colors, light hang glide off the moon (In the dark)

[Outro]
(In the dark)
I'd do anything for you
(In the dark)
I'd do anything for you
(In the dark)
I'd do anything for you
(In the dark)
I'd do anything for you
(In the dark)
I'd do anything for you, anything for you
(In the dark)
I'd do anything for you, anything for[Verse 1]
The best song wasn't the single, but you weren't either
Livin' in Ladera Heights, the black Beverly Hills
Domesticated paradise, palm trees and pools
The water's blue, swallow the pill
Keepin' it surreal, whatever you like
Whatever feels good, whatever takes your mountain high
Keepin' it surreal, not sugar-free
My TV ain't HD, that's too real
Grapevine, mango, peaches, and limes, the sweet life

[Pre-Chorus 1]
The sweet life, sweet life
Sweet life, sweet life
The sweet, sweet, sweet, sweet life
Sweet life, the sweet life
Sweetie pie

You've had a landscaper and a house keeper since you were born
The starshine always kept you warm
So why see the world, when you got the beach?
Don't know why see the world, when you got the beach
The sweet life

[Verse 2]
The best song wasn't the single
But you couldn't turn your radio down
Satellite need a receiver, can't seem to turn the signal fully off
Transmitting the waves
You're catching that breeze 'til you're dead in the grave
But you're keepin' it surreal, whatever you like
Whatever feels good, whatever takes you mountain high
Keepin' it surreal, not sugar-free
My TV ain't HD, that's too real
Grapevines, mango, peaches, and lime, a sweet life

[Pre-Chorus 2]
A sweet life
A sweet life, yeah
A sweet life, a sweet life
A sweet life
Live and die in the life

[Chorus]
You've had a landscaper and a house keeper since you were born (Yeah)
The starshine always kept you warm
So why see the world, when you got the beach?
Don't know why see the world, when you got the beach?
The sweet life

[Bridge]
And the water is exactly what I wanted (Ah)
It's everything I thought it would be (Thought it would be)
But this neighborhood is gettin' trippier every day
The neighborhood is goin' ape shit crazy, ahh

[Chorus]
You've had a landscaper and a house keeper since you were born
The starshine always kept you warm
So why see the world, when you got the beach?
Don't know why see the world, when you got the beach

Arm stretch a tee like I nailed it

And I walk in my sleep, I can't help that (I can't)
Whens the last time I asked for some help that

I couldn't get from nobody out there (I cant)
When's the last time I asked for some help that

Nobody

I don't get weak in the knees
Hundreds spread out like a fan
Vert feel like some Gucci sandals
Open the sky, get a handful
Torso marked up like a vandal
How you not fuckin with cash?

Gave you what you could handle
I got the grip like the handle

Bikin', I'm bikin', I'm bikin' slow-mo
Maybe the four wheel excitin' us mo'
I'm cold when the temperatures dip below 70s
How can I be burr around L.A. coast?
The diamonds is plural, the Tiffany brooch
On my lapel, at the table, I'm givin' a toast
The first wedding that I've been in my twenties
Thinkin' maybe someone is not somethin' to own
Maybe the government got nothin' to do with it
Thinkin' maybe the feeling just comes and it goes
Think I want me a lil' one that look like my clone
Me and my baby can't do on our own
I landed a trick, got my impossibles
I'm fuckin' with Addy, I'm watchin' my dose
24 hours like they never close
I'm bikin', I'm bikin', I'm bikin' these blocks, yeah
Since Ben Baller sold all his ice up at Slauson, ooh
I'm bikin' uphill and it's burnin' my quads (Obstacles)
I'm bikin' downhill and it sound like a fishin' rod
Savage, I'm bikin', yeah

From Coldwater to the Shaw
Alcoholic way I handle the bars

Nah, you can't fuck with the boy
That's my problem, yeah, I got 'em
My tire smokin' when I stop
Okay, nobody fuckin' with me
My accolades hang from my neck
Pedal, I drown in the heat
My sapphires drown in my sweat
White mags, but I jet

I'm Roger Rabbit in the air

Nigga one wheel, one wheel, one wheel
Nigga one wheel, I fishtail downhill, yeah
I rose my rate, brand new brakes
Why I name it Slater? Ask my date

Ayy, ayy, so now I'm

[Verse: Andr 3000]
So low that I can see under the skirt of an ant
So low that I don't get high no more
When I "geronimo!," I just go "heh"
Solo, my cup is a rojo, my cholo, my friend
So low that I can admit
When I hear that another kid is shot by the popo
It ain't an event no more
So low that no more high horses, so hard to wear Polo
When I do, I cut the pony off
Now there's a hole where there once was a logo, how fitting
So low that I can give a fuck about what is trending
Tryna cut down on my spending
Regardless of winning, instead of pretending
And bending over backwards
Over half of these hoes had work done
Sayin' they want something real from a man
Just saying it, we being real persons
I hate that it's like this, I feel for you, and
I don't know what it's like with a skirt on
So pardon me if I am being insensitive
But darling this only worsens
So low my halo stay way low, it feels like it's bent
So low that when they throw pussy or pesos
I pay no attention to it
So low that I am no rookie but feel like a kid
Lookin' at the other kids
With astonishment while I'm on punishment
Watchin' the summer come close to an end
After 20 years in, I'm so nave I was under the impression
That everyone wrote they own verses
It's comin' back different and, yeah, that shit hurts me
I'm hummin' and whistlin' to those not deserving
I've stumbled and lived every word
Was I working just way too hard?[Intro]
Alright, hold on

[Verse 1]
If I was being honest
I'd say long as I could fuck three times a day
And not skip a meal, I'm good
I used to work on my feet for 7 dollars a hour
Call my Momma like, "Momma
I ain't making minimum wage, Momma
I'm on, Momma, I'm on
Now  I'm making 400, 600, 800K, Momma
To stand on my feet, Momma
Play these songs, it's therapy, Momma
They paying me, Momma
I should be paying them
I should be paying, y'all honest to God
I'm just a guy, I'm not a god
Sometimes I feel like I'm a god, but I'm not a god
If I was I don't know which heaven would have me, Momma
Let me run this bitch
I'ma run it into the ground, Momma, the whole galaxy
God damn, fuck these lames, they don't want none
Fuck these lames, they don't want none
Fuck these niggas
Fuck these niggas, they don't want none
Fuck these niggas
Fuck you niggas
Fuck me if I hated on you

[Verse 2]
I'ma stick around
I'm gon' let my nuts hang
Nigga, you got some just like me don't you?
Or maybe not just like me
You know I'm Africano Americano
And even if you're half Japanese, roots run deep
Family tree, throw a big shadow
(Jamming to the rhythm)
Tech company
Please gimme immortality
(It's a face to face)
I'm going rapidly, fading drastically
(Keep me high, Castrati)
(Punani fade the stress)
Or pull the zip down
Wet your lips first, lick the tip now
(Bugatti left some stretch marks on that freeway)
Smoke some'n
(Marks on that freeway)
They tryna find 2Pac, don't let 'em find 2Pac
He evade the press, he escape the stress
La da da da da, la da da da da
La da da da da (la da da da da)

[Verse 3]
I'll keep quiet and let you run your phone bill up
I know you love to talk
I ain't on your schedule
I ain't on no schedule
I ain't had me a job since 2009
I ain't on no sales floor
You say I'm changing on you
I feel like Selena, they wanna murder a nigga
Murder me like Selena
You must ain't get the memo
I don't cut bitches no more
But your bitch my exception
Come get her outta my four door
I only got one four door
Remember when I had that Lexus, no
Our friendship don't go back that far
Tyler slept on my sofa, yeah
Niggas go back that far
I ain't smoked all year
This the last song so, I'm finna wipe that off
Tolerance is so low, still smoke a whole 'gar
Mnage on my birthday, tap out on the first stroke
'Cause this ain't no work day, she don't give head anyway
'Cause what niggas say, that's what she tell her man
What a difference distance makes
Niggas want fight in the streets
Now shit starting to make my hands hurt
Jay hit me on the email, said I oughta act my net worth
Dog this is chess now, not fetch
I ain't runnin' for a nigga, ain't ran since track meet
That's the only time I ran from a nigga
You could change this track now
Could've changed this bitch a long time ago
know and know, know and know
Shout out to Hollygrove, I'm from that 7th though
Twins know and Lance know, Clark know and Matt know
Shit went 180 on me, please run that back though
(Tucks til 24)

[Skit]
You say some shit about me?
Turn a real sport, my nigga
That second time Jerron was there, nigga
On God he grabbed me and then that nigga tried to pull me
Yeah, 'cause the nigga tried to boom me in my face
I had AD in a headlock, nigga, I had this nigga like

[Outro: Mikey Alfred, Ryan Breaux & Sage Elsesser]
Make sure you speak up
Okay
What's your name?
Ryan
Yo, ayy be quiet. What's your name? What do you do? What's your first memory?
The first word I learned to say or that I ever said
What's the most amazing thing you've ever witnessed?
(Uh, hell no)
(You're not gonna make it, are you?)
Friendship and how it controls the world, hahaha
Hahaha, alright, um, what three superpowers do you wish you had? They say they have to be...
Flying, super strength...
Alright, what's your name?
Maybe we can get a littlea little bit, a little bit, a little bit
I wish I could sleep without, like, being dead
But forever at the same time
Yo, what, what's, what's the... dog, stop, stop, stop
(What you mean bro?)
And ships could fly. Buildings would be very, very tall
And everybody won't know the ground is up
(That's fucked up)
Chloe, shh, okay, start over right now
Best thing about being me is I got a nice set of friends
Pretty clear mind, I feel like, sometimes
Probably, uh, being great
I think a lot, a lot, too much. Sometimes I'm very messy
Talents, got any secret talents?
I don't think so, I'm pretty open and all in everything that I do
Talents? Um, I can play the theremin
Probably, uh, probably Tyler, his life seems pretty awesome
No, actually, no, fuck him. Um, I don't know
Probably Dill 'cause he doesn't have to do anything at all
Just sits inside his house
What's your name?
Sage Elsesser
What do you do?
I play soccer and I go to school
Um, I wanna be better at skating
(It's probably up something really high, it's super high
I tried to land, like, a handstand or something)
Alright, that's it...
I spend a couple hours with my family and I go out
And do everything that I ever thought about trying
How far is a light year? How far is a light year?
(A second, a thousand years?)[Verse: Frank Ocean & Yung Lean]
I will always love you how I do
Let go of a prayer for you
Just a sweet word
The table is prepared for you
(Ooh, ooh, ooh)
Ball so hard, all my boys flex
Wishing you godspeed, glory
There will be mountains you won't move
(Ooh, ooh, ooh)
Still I'll always be there for you how I do
I let go of my claim on you
It's a free world
You look down on where you came from sometimes
But you'll have this place to call home always

[Bridge: Frank Ocean & Kim Burrell]
(Godspeed, glory)
This love will keep us through blinding of the eyes (Ohh)
Silence in the ears, darkness of the mind
Until it's time
This love will keep us through blinding of the eyes (Ohh)
Silence in the ears, darkness of the mind (Ohh)
Ohh, it's 'til it's time we die
This love will keep us through blinding of the eyes
Silence in the ears, darkness of the mind

[Outro: Kim Burrell]
Oh-oh, ohhh
I'll always love you
Until the time we die
Oh-oh, ohhh[Intro]
We once had things in common
Now the only thing we share is the refrigerator
Ice cold, baby, I told you, I'm ice cold (Ice cold!)
You out here flyin' high (High)
Go head, fly that thing!
High, high, yeah
But fly alone

[Verse 1]
You always smokin' in the house
What if my mother comes over?
You can't get up and get a job
'Cause this little hustle's getting you by
You're the dealer and the stoner
With the sweetest kiss I've ever known

[Chorus]
I know what I was on
I had a Pilot Jones (What you know about it?)
She took me high (Oh, did she now?)
Then she took me home (We talkin' 'bout)
Pilot Jones, Pilot Jones

[Verse 2]
Tonight she came stumblin' across my lawn again
I just don't know why I keep on tryin' to keep a grown woman sober
See there you go reachin' up your blouse
And no, I don't want a child
But I ain't been touched in a while
By the dealer and the stoner
With the sweetest kiss I've ever known, ever known

[Chorus]
I know what I was on (Ever known)
I had a Pilot Jones (What you know about it?)
She took me high (Oh, did she now?)
Then she took me home (We talkin' 'bout)
Pilot Jones, Pilot Jones

[Verse 3]
In the sky up above, the birds
I saw the sky like I never seen before
You thought I was above you
Above this in so many ways
But if I got a condo on a cloud
Then I guess you can stay at my place
I'ma get one

Breakfast and dinners is blending
We spent all that time alone
Alone watching the clouds roll

I gotta pack came from the DHL

Independent jug
Selling records out the trunk
I'm already rich as fuck
So the products in the front
Got my patna in the front
Been my BF for a month but we been fucking from the jump[Verse 1]
This is joy, this is summer
Keep alive, stay alive
Got your metal on, we're alone
Making sweet love, takin' time
'Til God strikes us
That's a pretty fucking fast year flew by
That's a pretty long third gear in this car
Glidin' on the five
The deer run across, kill the headlights
Pretty fucking, underneath moonlight now
Pretty fucking, sunrise in sight
In comes the morning, haunting us with the beams
Solstice ain't as far as it used to be
It begins to blur, we get older (Blur!)
Summer's not as long as it used to be
Everyday counts like crazy (Smoke, haze)
Wanna get soaked?
Wanna film a tape on the speed boat?
We smell of Californication
Strike a pose
Everything grows in the Congo
Everything grows
Can you come when I call again?

[Verse 2]
On comes the evening, gold seeking ends
Piece in my hands worth twice than a friend
And two limbs over shoulder, carried away
Because I'm stronger and the Congo is dim (smoke)
In comes the morning (smoke)
In comes the morning (haze)[Verse 1]
I believe Jehovah Jireh
I believe there's heaven, I believe in war
I believe a woman's temple
Gives her the right to choose but baby don't abort
I believe that marriage isn't
Between a man and woman but between love and love
And I believe you when you say that you've lost all faith
But you must believe in something, something, something
You gotta believe in something, something, something

[Hook]
I still believe in man
A wise one asked me why
Cause I just don't believe we're wicked
I know that we sin but I do believe we try
We all try, the girls try, the boys try
Women try, men try, you and I try, try, we all try

[Verse 2]
I don't believe in time travel
I don't believe our nation's flag is on the moon
I don't believe our lives are simple
And I don't believe they're short, this is interlude
I don't believe my hands are cleanly
Can't believe that you would let me touch your heart
She didn't believe me when I said that I lost my faith
You must believe in something, something, something
You gotta believe in something, something, something

[Hook]
I still believe in man
A wise one asked me why
Cause I just don't believe we're wicked
I know that we sin but I do believe we try
We all try, the girls try, the boys try
Women try, men try, you and I try, try, we all try

[Outro]
Try to believe (just try)
I do believe, I do believe[Produced by Malay and Om'Mas Keith]

[Verse 1]
You don't know how little you matter until you're all alone
In the middle of Arkansas with a little rock left in that glass dick
Used to date a blonde, you used to hit it raw
'Cause she was and you are madly involved, madly involved

[Hook]
Hittin' stones in glass homes
You're smokin' stones in abandoned homes
You hit them stones and broke your home
Crack rock, crack rock
Crack rock, crack rock
Hittin' stones in glass homes
You're smokin' stones in abandoned homes
You hit them stones and broke your home
Crack rock, crack rock
Crack rock, crack rock

[Verse 2]
You're shuckin' and jivin', stealin' and robbin'
To get the fixing that you're itching for
Your family stopped inviting you to things
Won't let you hold their infant
You used to to get a little cut-up from time to time
But the freaks ain't trying to sleep with cracky

[Hook]
Hittin' stones in glass homes
You're smokin' stones in abandoned homes
You hit them stones and you broke your home
Crack rock
Crack rock, crack rock

[Bridge]
Crooked cop, dead cop
How much dope can you push to me?
Crooked cop, dead cop
No good for community
Fuckin' pig get shot, three hundred men will search for me
My brother get popped and don't no one hear the sound
Don't no one hear the rounds (Sound)
Don't no one hear the shells (Shells)

[Outro]
Don't no one hear a sound
Don't no one disturb the peace for riot
Don't no one disrupt nirvana
Don't no one wanna blow the high
Crack rock, crack rock, crack rock
How you feeling, girl?
How's the gutter doing?
Crack rock[Verse 1]
(We're spendin' too much time alone)
Spendin' too much time alone
(And I just ran outta Trojans)
Horses gallop to her throne
(We're behaving like teenagers)
We're behaving like teenagers
(Making less than minimum wage)
Still inside our parents' homes
(No, I don't live in Denver)
No, I don't live in Denver
(I grew up in Sierra Leone)
And her pink skies will keep me warm
Sierra Leone
Sierra Leone

[Verse 2]
Tid bits of intuition that I be gettin' abandon mission
(Sierra Leone)
Abandon mission, you must be kiddin', this shit feelin' different
Shit feelin' too good to me
Glistening, shimmerin' underneath the sunlight, the sunlight
(Sierra Leone)

[Outro]
And a new day will bring about the dawn
And a new day will bring another crying babe into the world
(Girl now)
Our daughter's reaching for your nipple 'cause it's time for her to eat (Reaching for ya)
Tonight I'll lay her in the cradle if it's time to go to sleep (Oh, go to sleep, oh, oh)
I'll sing a Lennon lullaby, she can have a pretty dream
Baby girl, if you knew what I know, knew what I know

[Outro]
Na, na na, na na, na...
Na, na na, na na, na...[Verse]
Here's to the good guy, he hooked it up
Said if I was in NY I should look you up
First time I'd ever saw you
And you text nothing like you look
Here's to the gay bar you took me to
Here's when I realized you talk so much more than I do
Here's to the highlights when I was convinced
That this was much more than just some night shit
I know you don't need me right now
And to you it's just a late night out

[Outro]
This niggaall the bitches in the neighborhood wanna fuck you, nigga
He told me
I used to fuck with all of 'em
YeahI ain't got bitches no more
But now I don't care about bitches like that, my nigga, that shit... Jasmine fucking wrecked my heart
I don't even know how I feel about bi[Verse: Frank Ocean]
I'll be honest, I wasn't devastated
But you could've held my hands through this, baby
Let my mind run underneath warm jets
I run my hands through what's left
But we're getting older, baby
Dont have much longer baby
Why am I preaching
To this choir, to this atheist?
Just like mine, versions of these belong to you
After a while, they're keeping me close to you

[Outro: Stevie Wonder]
Just like me, they long to be close to youBASEDGOD WAS RIGHT. were all a bunch of golden million dollar babies. my hope is that the babies born these days will inherit less of the bullshit than we did. anyhow, what im about to post is for anyone who cares to read. it was intended to fill the thank yous section in my album credits, but with all the rumors going round.. I figured itd be good to clarify

Whoever you are. Wherever you are Im starting to think were a lot alike. Human beings spinning on blackness. All wanting to be seen, touched, heard, paid attention to. My loved ones are everything to me here. In the last year or 3 Ive screamed at my creator, screamed at clouds in the sky, for some explanation. Mercy maybe. For peace of mind to rain like manna somehow. 4 summers ago, I met somebody. I was 19 years old. He was too. We spent that summer, and the summer after, together. Everyday almost. And on the days we were together, time would glide. Most of the day Id see him, and his smile. Id hear his conversation and his silenceuntil it was time to sleep. Sleep I would often share with him. By the time I realized I was in love, it was malignant. It was hopeless. There was no escaping, no negotiating with the feeling. No choice. It was my first love, it changed my life. Back then, my mind would wander to the women I had been with, the ones I cared for and thought I was in love with. I reminisced about the sentimental songs I enjoyed when I was a teenager.. The ones I played when I experienced a girlfriend for the first time. I realised they were written in a language I did not yet speak. I realised too much, too quickly. Imagine being thrown from a plane. I wasnt in a plane though. I was in a Nissan Maxima, the same car I packed up with bags and drove to Los Angeles in. I sat there and told my friend how I felt. I wept as the words left my mouth. I grieved for them, knowing I could never take them back for myself. He patted my back. He said kind things. He did his best, but he wouldnt admit the same. He had to go back inside soon, it was late and his girlfriend was waiting for him upstairs. He wouldnt tell the truth about his feelings for me for another 3 years. I felt like Id only imagined reciprocity for years. Now imagine being thrown from a cliff. No, I wasnt on a cliff. I was still in my car telling myself it was gonna be fine and to take deep breaths. I took the breaths and carried on. I kept up a peculiar friendship with him because I couldnt imagine keeping up my life without him. I struggled to master myself and my emotions. I wasnt always successful

The dance went on.. I kept the rhythm for several summers after. Its winter now. Im typing this on a plane back to Los Angeles from New Orleans. I flew home for another marred Christmas. I have a windowseat. Its December 27, 2011. By now Ive written two albums. This being the second. I wrote to keep myself busy and sane. I wanted to create worlds that were rosier than mine. I tried to channel overwhelming emotions. Im surprised at how far all of it has taken me. Before writing this Id told some people my story. Im sure these people kept me alive, kept me safe. Sincerely, these are the folks I wanna thank from the floor of my heart. Everyone of you knows who you are.. Great humans, probably angels. I dont know what happens now, and thats alrite. I dont have any secrets I need kept anymore. Theres probably some small shit still, but you know what I mean. I was never alone, as much as it felt like it. As much as I still do sometimes. I never was. I dont think I ever could be. Thanks. To my first love, Im grateful for you. Grateful that even though it wasnt what I hoped for and even though it was never enough, it was. Some things never are.. and we were. I wont forget you. I wont forget the summer. Ill remember who I was when I met you. Ill remember who you were and how weve both changed and stayed the same. Ive never had more respect for life and living than I have right now. Maybe it takes a near death experience to feel alive. Thanks. To my mother. You raised me strong. I know Im only brave because you were first. So thank you. All of you. For everything good. I feel like a free man. If I listen closely.. I can hear the sky falling too

-Frank[Intro]
American love, American me, American you
American tear, American heartbreak, oh, oh, oh

[Verse 1]
I took a walk with the palm trees as the daylight fell
Sangria in a canteen, talking to myself (I can't remember)
This tattoo on my left hand is turning purple-ish blue
Daydreams of the romance, daydreams of you
My pretty woman in a ballgown, I'm Richard Gere in a tux
Getting married in a courthouse, writing vows in a rush
Making out before the judge with my teenage wife
Got a wedding band done that I just might die with

[Chorus]
It's an American wedding
They don't mean too much, but we were so in love
We had an American wedding
Now what's mine is yours, that's American law

[Verse 2]
M-R-S dot Kennedy, she signed her name in pen
In a fancy, fancy cursive, then turned her term papers in
A thesis on Islamic virgin brides and arranged marriage
Hijabs and polygamist husbands, those poor un-American girls
After school she ran to me, jumped in my 5.0
This is the home of the brave, land of the free
But your parents still didn't know
She said, "I've had a hell of a summer
So, baby, don't take this hard
But maybe we should get an annulment
Before this goes way too far"

[Chorus]
It's just an American wedding
They don't mean too much, they don't last enough
We had an American wedding
Now what's mine is yours, American divorce

[Verse 3]
Well, you can have my Mustang, that's all I've got in my name
But Jesus Christ, don't break my heart
This wedding ring won't ever wipe off
But if you stay, oh, if you stay
You'll probably leave later anyway, it's love made in the USA

[Outro: James Fauntleroy]
Don't let 'em front you to saying you can't move
Without 'em, fuck 'em, I tell 'em this ain't new
We been some hustlers since it began, dude
Ain't gon' be tripping over some bitch-ass, dude
They so vain, I tell 'em this ain't you
You can get sensitive but the shit ain't true
These niggas can't do nothing that I can't do
That she can't do, that he can't do
That you can't do, that we can't do
Man, I had a dream and then the shit came true
And nigga, if I did it, I think you can too
These niggas can't do nothing that I can't do
That she can't do, that he can't do
That you can't do, that we can't do
Man, I had a dream and then the shit came true
These niggas can't do nothing that I can't do
That she can't do, that he can't do, that you can't do[Verse 1]
Memo finna start acting out if I don't see him soon
Yeah my best friend ain't backing out, it's still on sight, fool
I'm the only one out here on the night loops
I'm the only one out here on the night loops
Trophy case still light, body need a race stripe
And these minerals on my body break light
And these reds on my body brakelight
New man comin' up ahead on his own two
Is you a natural blondie like Goku?
Sleepin' on my belly in a loop like a serpent
Talking Heads ripplin' on the surface

Pro...
Ooh, oooh, oooh
Tonight I might change my life, all for you
All for you (Provide)

[Verse 2]
Provided, diamond lane that didn't exist
Packed the Astro van and brought my kids through
Prada tee on the eldest, throw the Gildan on the children
Hand-me-down fits
Chest pass, see mist off rotation (Swish, swisha)
Stiff smile just like I'm Aphex Twin (Yeah, come to daddy, yeah)
Pat the Patagonia pockets, tryna find my zip (uh, where it's at? Yeah)
Blunt twist, tightropes, I'm not fallin' off (never that, no)
Watch friends, go pro through fisheye lens, drownin' off clear
I just saw JAWS, divin' under influence
Been feelin' like the Lord just out of reach for me (for me)
How I feel lettin' man speak
How I feel lettin' man speak for me (for me)

Can't show my face if you spit for me
Spit for me, yeah

[Chorus]
No hablar de m, ni hablar de esto
Lo que l quiere de ti, yo noselo negara
Si estono me ha parto', ya nome partir nunca
Si puedo soportar lo que siento, por qu me estoy cayendo?

[Verse]
You stood me up, you laid me down
You know too much, I can't be proud
I still really, really love you, yes, I do
When I still really, really love you, like I do
If you won't, then I will
If you can't, then I will
Is it love to keep it from you?

[Chorus]
No hablar de m, ni hablar de esto
Lo que l quiere de ti, yo no se lo negara
Si esto no me ha parto', ya no me partir nunca
Si puedo soportar lo que siento, por qu me estoy cayendo?

[Outro]
Acaso voy cayendo?
You stood me up, you lay me down
You know too much (Too much), I can't be proud
I still really, really love you, yes, I do[Skit: Rosie Watson]
Many college students have gone to college
And gotten hooked on drugs, marijuana, and alcohol
Listen, stop trying to be somebody else
Don't try to be someone else
Be yourself and know that that's good enough
Don't try to be someone else
Don't try to be like someone else
Don't try to act like someone else
Be yourself, be secure with yourself
Rely and trust upon your own decisions
On your own beliefs
You understand the things that I've taught you
Not to drink alcohol, not to use drugs
Don't use that cocaine or marijuana
Because that stuff is highly addictive
When people become weed-heads
They become sluggish, lazy, stupid and unconcerned
Sluggish, lazy, stupid and unconcerned
That's all marijuana does to you, okay? This is mom
Unless you're taking it under doctor's, um, control
Then it's regulated
Do not smoke marijuana, do not consume alcohol
Do not get in the car with someone who is inebriated
This is mom, call me, bye[Part I: End]

[Verse: Frank Ocean]
Darker times
They're telling boulder heavy lies
Looks like all we've got is each other
The truth is obsolete
Remember when all I had was my mother
She didn't compromise
She could recognize
Voodoo
Our daughters and our sons
Are just candles in the sun
Voodoo
Don't let him see divide
Don't you let her see divide
Voodoo
She's got the whole wide world in her juicy fruit
He's got the whole wide world in his pants
He wrapped the whole wide world in a wedding band
Then put the whole wide world on her hands
She's got the whole wide world in her hands
He's got the whole wide world in his hands

[Outro]
There's somethin' about you
I can't believe I'm even talking to you, tellin' you this right now
You're special
I wish you could see what I see

[Part II: Golden Girl]

[Verse 1: Frank Ocean]
She peels an orange for us in the morning
She woke me up to give me half
I can hear the children soccer ballin'
Like wildcats running on the grass, hey
You're a girl on this island
I'm a boy from America
My flight leaves tonight, but I don't think I'm going backwards
I won't be going backwards

[Chorus: Frank Ocean]
You're my golden girl
You're the one I've chosen, girl
You're 24k
You make it bright when it's grey
You're my golden girl
The sun has been kind to you
You're 24k (girl)
But the sky's never grey (never grey)

[Verse 2: Frank Ocean]
Silent moments, meditative poses
You break my focus, you make me laugh
Two mopeds racing through the forest
Making dirt clouds on a path, on a path
I'm my best on this island
I'm a mess in America
My flight left last night, but I know I'm not going back home, yeah
I'm not going back home, no

[Chorus: Frank Ocean]
You're my golden girl
You're the one I've chosen, girl
You're 24k
You make it bright when it's grey
You're my golden girl
The sun has been kind to you
You're 24k (girl)
But the sky's never grey (never grey)

[Bridge: Frank Ocean]
If we build a house in paradise, will we get to heaven still?
(Tropic, tropic, tropic, breezes, breezes, breezes)
If we don't have to live through hell just to get to heaven
(Tropic, tropic, tropic, breezes, breezes, breezes, breezes)
I'mma stay right here, with you
(Tropic, tropic, tropic, breezes, breezes, breezes, breezes)
Til the hurricane comes, 'til the tsunami comes, I've found my gold
(Tropic, tropic, tropic, breezes)

[Chorus: Frank Ocean]
You're my golden girl
You're the one I've chosen, girl
You're 24k
You make it bright when it's grey
You're my golden girl
The sun has been kind to you
You're 24k (girl)
But the sky's never grey (never grey)

[Verse 3: Tyler, The Creator]
Um, you're my G-O L-D E-N G-I R-L
And that's for the females that can't spell, but
Thanks for fucking with me
You turn my dark into light, you're like a bucket of bleach
You see, I want you to know that
My negatives at home aren't working for my Kodak
So that means that I don't want to go back
Just know that I would like to stay here and hold that
Hand of yours, girl I'm a wreck in America
Your face is the best cause it's the same color as the lace on my neck
And you're golden, uh, your eyes open, fuck it
Let's toast and listen to Michael Bolton
I free-fall off the hill again
Let's see where I land, I'm like Gilligan
Um, I trust you, Golden, for wed ring
I'm just hopin' that you don't turn my neck green

[Outro][Verse]
No sleeper seats, that's a mattress
No sleeper seats, that's a mattress
You ain't stingy, split yourtabletswith me
You won'tflinch when camera's flashing, flashing
Not fakelaid back, no, it's natural
And I think you made for the life I lead
I'm not fake patient, I don't fake sick, huh
That kinda coffin don't need lean
Rest in peace
Got this lust for life in me, yeah
Horny for the game, uh
First they kiss, then they bite soft, uh
Then that bitch wanna play it off, huh
Fuck it, I'm pretty still in a pit of snakes
While serpents shake some brand new scales
I need a new face, I'm tired of these weirdos
Acting familiar, took all the rock
And turned it to pop, he think that he Elvis
And he ungrateful, they don't say thank you
They don't say grace, not even for meals, not even for millions
Fuck it, I'm pretty still, look at my deal
Richard Mille, look at my ears, flooded with diamonds
Look at my skills, running through blocks like 49ers
Forty-nine diamonds, stuffed in my bracelet
That cost a whop, that cost a whopper
And it ain't new, I had a knot at John Ehret in my locker
Pretty still, it ain't no pretty pill
It's either real or real
Real easy on the eyes, green like a soccer field
Skin hot when they tried me like them poppers feel
Hands shaking, norepinephrine levels skyrocket, fuel
Rocket

[Bridge]
Quit being violent with me
Quit being violent with me
Quit being violent with me
You make me violent

[Outro]
My room, my room, my room with me
Every night you were in my room
My room, my room with me
I guess I can't state my feelings too soon
I don't know you
And I can't put no threats in the air[Verse 1]
She singing, "Bitch, I'm paid, that's all I gotta say"
I'm like, who knew? Who knew? Who knew?
That after all the years, I'd make a Weezy fan
Out of you too, you too, you too
When I met you, you were Thom Yorke
Chris Martin and U2, U2, U2
When you met me, I was Three 6, Pimp C
Bun B, 8-Ball and MJG, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
But we're both a long way from home
We got the windows down, the radio's on, always

[Chorus]
I wrote a letter to the sky
Saying, "Maybe one day you'll get to kiss me"
My girl found it in the car and said
"Baby, why you trying to diss me?"
'Cause you know you're my baby
Oh, you know you're my baby, ooh
I'm not just in it for the ride, in it for the ride

[Post-Chorus]
Yeah, oh, ah
Yeah, oh, ah
Yeah, oh
Yeah, oh

[Verse 2]
You said, "One day, I'll start up my car and it'll explode"
Well, now that's the last time I'm letting you watch Casino alone
You hate when I leave you in the motel while I hunt for jobs
So now I let you drive and wait outside in the parking lot

[Pre-Chorus]
I know we're both a long way from home
Just keep the windows down, the radio's on, always

[Chorus]
I wrote a letter to the sky
Saying, "Maybe one day you'll get to kiss me, kiss me, kiss me"
My girl found it in the car and said
"Baby, why you trying to diss me, diss me, diss me?
Don't you know you're my baby?
Don't you know you're my baby, ooh?
I'm not just in it for the ride, in it for the ride, yeah

[Outro]
You'll live a better life
(A better life, young one, a better life, young one)
A dull life ain't nothing
Don't speed, who cares what car you're driving?
No Benz can make you friends
She don't care what car I'm driving
And no Bentley can kiss me back
This song is dedicated to my '91 Acura
My 1991[Intro]
One, two

[Chorus]
Moon river, wider than a mile
I'm crossing you in style someday
A dream maker (maker)
My heart (you heart) breaker
Wherever you're goin', I'm goin' that way (the same)

[Refrain]
Two drifters off to see the world
There's such a crazy world to see
We're all chasin' after all the same
Chasin' after our ends

[Chorus]
Moon river, wider than a mile
Crossin' in style someday
My dream maker, heartbreaker
Wherever you're goin', I'm goin' the same

[Refrain]
Two drifters off to see the world
It's such a crazy world you'll see
What I see, who I become
What I see, who I become
We're all chasin' after our ends
Chasin' after our ends

[Outro]
Life's just around the bend, my friend
Moon river and me[Verse 1]
Fly me to the moon
Let me play among the stars
And let me see what spring is like
On a-Jupiter and Mars
In other words, hold my hand
In other words, baby, kiss me

[Verse 2]
Fill my heart with song
And let me sing forevermore
You are all I long for
All I worship and adore
In other words, please be true
In other words, I love you

[Instrumental Bridge]

[Verse 3]
Fill my heart with song
Let me sing forevermore
You are all I long for
All I worship and adore
In other words, please be true
In other words, in other words
I love you[Verse 1]
And now, the end is near
And so I face the final curtain
My friend, I'll say it clear
I'll state my case, of which I'm certain
I've lived a life that's full
I traveled each and every highway
And more, much more than this
I did it my way

[Verse 2]
Regrets, I've had a few
But then again, too few to mention
I did what I had to do
And saw it through without exemption
I planned each charted course
Each careful step along the byway
And more, much more than this
I did it my way

[Verse 3]
Yes, there were times, I'm sure you knew
When I bit off more than I could chew
But through it all, when there was doubt
I ate it up and spit it out
I faced it all, and I stood tall
And did it my way

[Verse 4]
I've loved, I've laughed and cried
I've had my fill, my share of losing
And now, as tears subside
I find it all so amusing
To think I did all that
And may I say, not in a shy way
Oh, no, oh, no, not me
I did it my way

[Verse 5]
For what is a man, what has he got?
If not himself, then he has naught
To say the things he truly feels
And not the words of one who kneels
The record shows I took the blows
And did it my way

[Outro]
Yes, it was my way[Verse 1]
Start spreading the news, I'm leaving today
I want to be a part of it
New York, New York
These vagabond shoes, are longing to stray
Right through the very heart of it
New York, New York
I wanna wake up in a city that doesn't sleep
And find I'm king of the hill, top of the heap
These little town blues, are melting away

[Hook 1]
I'll make a brand new start of it in old New York
If I can make it there, I'll make it anywhere
It's up to you, New York, New York

[Verse 2]
New York, New York
I want to wake up in a city that never sleeps
And find I'm a number one, top of the list
King of the hill, a number one
These little town blues, are melting away

[Hook 2]
And I'm gonna make a brand new start of it in old New York
And if I can make it there, I'm gonna make it anywhere
It's up to you, New York, New York[Verse 1]
That's life (That's life), that's what all the people say
You're riding high in April, shot down in May
But I know I'm gonna change that tune
When I'm back on top, back on top in June
I said, that's life (That's life), and as funny as it may seem
Some people get their kicks, stompin' on a dream
But I don't let it, let it get me down
'Cause this fine old world it keeps spinning around

[Chorus]
I've been a puppet, a pauper, a pirate, a poet, a pawn and a king
I've been up and down and over and out, and I know one thing
Each time I find myself flat on my face
I pick myself up and get back in the race

[Verse 2]
That's life (That's life), I tell ya, I can't deny it
I thought of quitting, baby
But my heart just ain't gonna buy it
And if I didn't think it was worth one single try
I'd jump right on a big bird and then I'd fly

[Chorus]
I've been a puppet, a pauper, a pirate, a poet, a pawn and a king
I've been up and down and over and out, and I know one thing
Each time I find myself laying flat on my face
I just pick myself up and get back in the race

[Outro]
That's life (That's life), that's life and I can't deny it
Many times I thought of cutting out but my heart won't buy it
But if there's nothing shaking come this here July
I'm gonna roll myself up in a big ball and die
My, my[Vocals: Frank Sinatra & Nancy Sinatra]

[Verse 1]
I know I stand in line until you think you have the time to spend an evening with me
And if we go some place to dance, I know that there's a chance you won't be leaving with me

[Chorus 1]
Then afterwards we drop into a quiet little place and have a drink or two
And then I go and spoil it all by saying somethin' stupid like, "I love you"
I can see it in your eyes, that you despise the same old lies you heard the night before
And though it's just a line to you, for me it's true, and never seemed so right before

[Verse 2]
I practice every day to find some clever lines to say to make the meaning come true
But then I think I'll wait until the evening gets late, and I'm alone with you

[Chorus 2]
The time is right, your perfume fills my head, the stars get red, and, oh, the night's so blue
And then I go and spoil it all by saying somethin' stupid like, "I love you"

[Chorus 2]
The time is right, your perfume fills my head, the stars get red, and, oh, the night's so blue
And then I go and spoil it all by saying somethin' stupid like, "I love you"

[Outro]
"I love you"
"I love you"
"I love you"
"I love you"
"I love you"Some day, when I'm awfully low
When the world is cold
I will feel a glow just thinking of you
And the way you look tonight

Yes, you're lovely, with your smile so warm
And your cheeks so soft
There is nothing for me, but to love you
And the way you look tonight

With each word, your tenderness grows
Tearing my fear apart
And that laugh wrinkles your nose
Touches my foolish heart

Lovely; never, ever change
Keep that breathless charm
Won't you please arrange it? Cause I love you
Just the way you look tonight

[Instrumental]

And that laugh that wrinkles your nose
It touches my foolish heart

Lovely, Don't you ever change
Keep that breathless charm
Won't you please arrange it? Cause I love you
A-just the way you look tonight

Mm-Mm, Mm-Mm
Just the way you look tonight[Frank Sinatra]
Tall and tan and young and lovely
The girl from Ipanema goes walking
And when she passes
Each one she passes goes "ah"

[Frank Sinatra]
When she walks, she's like a samba
That swings so cool and sways so gentle
That when she passes, each one she passes goes  "ooh"

[Frank Sinatra]
But I watch her so sadly
How can I tell her I love her
Yes, I would give my heart gladly
But each day, when she walks to the sea
She looks straight ahead, not at me

[Frank Sinatra]
Tall, (and) tan, (and) young, (and) lovely, the girl from Ipanema goes walking
And when she passes, I smile but she doesn't see
(doesn't see)

[Antonio Carlos Jobim]
Olha que coisa mais linda mais cheia de graa
Ela menina que vem e que passa
Num doce balano a caminho do mar

[Antonio Carlos Jobim]
Moa do corpo dourado do sol de ipanema
O seu balanado mais que um poema
A coisa mais linda que eu j vi passar..

[Frank Sinatra]
Ooh, but I watch her so sadly

[Antonio Carlos Jobim]
Ah, Porque tudo to triste

[Frank Sinatra]
Yes, I would give my heart gladly

[Frank Sinatra & Antonio Carlos Jobim]
But each day, when she walks to the sea
She looks straight ahead, not at me

[Frank Sinatra]
Tall, tan, young, lovely
The girl from Ipanema goes walking
And when she passes, I smile but she doesn't see

[Antonio Carlos Jobim]
Por causa do amor

[Frank Sinatra]
She just doesn't see

[Antonio Carlos Jobim]
Nem olha para mim

[Frank Sinatra]
She never sees me

[Antonio Carlos Jobim]
Por causa do amor[Verse 1]
Come fly with me, let's fly, let's fly away
If you can use some exotic booze, there's a bar in far Bombay
Come fly with me, let's fly, let's fly away

[Verse 2]
Come fly with me, let's float down to Peru
In llama land, there's a one man band, and he'll toot his flute for you
Come fly with me, let's take off in the blue

[Chorus]
Once I get you up there, where the air is rarefied
We'll just glide, starry-eyed
Once I get you up there, I'll be holding you so near
You may hear angels cheer 'cause we're together

[Verse 3]
Weather wise, it's such a lovely day
Just say the words and we'll beat the birds down to Acapulco Bay
It's perfect for a flying honeymoon, they say
Come fly with me, let's fly, let's fly away

[Instrumental Interlude]

[Chorus]
Once I get you up there, where the air is rarefied
We'll just glide, starry-eyed
Once I get you up there, I'll be holding you so near
You may hear angels cheer 'cause we're together

[Verse 3]
Weather wise, it's such a lovely day
You just say the words and we'll beat the birds down to Acapulco Bay
It's perfect for a flying honeymoon, they say
Come fly with me, let's fly, let's fly

[Outro]
Pack up, let's fly awayYou're just too good to be true
I can't take my eyes off of you
You'd be like heaven to touch
I wanna hold you so much
At long last love has arrived
and I thank God I'm alive
You're just too good to be true
can't take my eyes off of you
Pardon the way that I stare,
there's nothing else to compare
The sight of you leaves me weak
there are no words left to speak
But if you feel like I feel,
please let me know that it's real
You're just too good to be true,
can't take my eyes off of you
I love you baby and if it's quite all right,
I need you baby to warm the lonely nights
I love you baby trust in me when I say
Oh pretty baby don't bring me down I pray
Oh pretty baby now that I found you, stay
And let me love you baby, let me love you
You're just too good to be true
can't take my eyes off of you
You'd be like heaven to touch
I wanna hold you so much
At long last love has arrived
and I thank God I'm alive
You're just too good to be true
can't take my eyes off of you
I love you baby and if it's quite all right,
I need you baby to warm the lonely night
I love you baby trust in me when I say
Oh pretty baby don't bring me down I pray
Oh pretty baby now that I found you, stay
And let me love you baby, let me love you[Verse 1]
Have yourself a merry little Christmas
Let your heart be light
Next year all our troubles will be out of sight

[Verse 2]
Have yourself a merry little Christmas
Make the Yuletide gay
Next year all our troubles will be miles away

[Bridge]
Once again as in olden days
Happy golden days of yore
Faithful friends who are dear to us
Will be near to us, once more

[Verse 3]
Someday soon we all will be together
If the fates allow
Until then we'll have to muddle through somehow

[Outro]
So have yourself a merry little Christmas now[Verse]
I've got you under my skin
I've got you deep in the heart of me
So deep in my heart that you're really a part of me
I've got you under my skin
I tried so not to give in
I said to myself, 'this affair never will go so well'
But why should I try to resist when, baby, I know so well
I've got you under my skin?

[Pre-Chorus 1]
I'd sacrifice anything, come what might
For the sake of having you near
In spite of a warning voice that comes in the night
And repeats, repeats in my ear

[Chorus 1]
"Don't you know little fool, you never can win?
Use your mentality, wake up to reality"
But each time that I do, just the thought of you
Makes me stop before I begin
'Cause I've got you under my skin

[Pre-Chorus 2]
I would sacrifice anything, come what might
For the sake of having you near
In spite of a warning voice that comes in the night
And repeats, how it yells in my ear

[Chorus 2]
"Don't you know, little fool, you never can win?
Why not use your mentality? Step up, wake up to reality"
But each time I do, just the thought of you
Makes me stop just before I begin
'Cause I've got you under my skin
Yes, I've got you, under my skinMy funny valentine
Sweet comic valentine
You make me smile with my heart
Your looks are laughable
Unphotographable
Yet you're my favourite work of art

Is your figure less than greek
Is your mouth a little weak
When you open it to speak
Are you smart?

But don't change a hair for me
Not if you care for me
Stay little valentine stay
Each day is valentines day

Is your figure less than greek
Is your mouth a little weak
When you open it to speak
Are you smart?

But don't you change one hair for me
Not if you care for me
Stay little valentine stay
Each day is valentines day[Verse 1]
When I was seventeen
It was a very good year
It was a very good year for small town girls
And soft summer nights
We'd hide from the lights
On the village green
When I was seventeen

[Verse 2]
When I was twenty-one
It was a very good year
It was a very good year for city girls
Who lived up the stair
With all that perfumed hair
And it came undone
When I was twenty-one

[Verse 3]
When I was thirty-five
It was a very good year
It was a very good year for blue-blooded girls
Of independent means
We'd ride in limousines
Their chauffeurs would drive
When I was thirty-five

[Verse 4]
But now the days are short
I'm in the autumn of the year
And now I think of my life as vintage wine
From fine old kegs
From the brim to the dregs
It poured sweet and clear
It was a very good yearBlue moon, you saw me standin' alone
Without a dream in my heart, without a love of my own
Blue moon, you knew just what I was there for
You heard me sayin' a prayer for
Someone I really could care for

And then there suddenly appeared before me
The only one my arms will hold
I heard somebody whisper "please adore me"
And when I looked, the moon had turned to gold

Blue moon, now I'm no longer alone
Without a dream in my heart
Without a love of my own

And then there suddenly appeared before me
The only one my arms will ever hold
I heard somebody whisper "please adore me"
And when I looked, the moon had turned to gold

Blue moon, now I'm no longer alone
Without a dream in my heart
Without a love of my own

Blue moon, now I'm no longer alone
Without a dream in my heart
Without a love of my ownStrangers in the night exchanging glances
Wondering in the night, what were the chances?
We'd be sharing love before the night was through

Something in your eyes was so inviting
Something in your smile was so exciting
Something in my heart told me I must have you

Strangers in the night
Two lonely people, we were strangers in the night
Up to the moment when we said our first hello, little did we know
Love was just a glance away, a warm embracing dance away and

Ever since that night we've been together
Lovers at first sight, in love forever
It turned out so right for strangers in the night

[Instrumental-first three lines of Chorus]
Love was just a glance away, a warm embracing dance away

Ever since that night we've been together
Lovers at first sight, in love forever
It turned out so right for strangers in the night

Dooby-doooby-doo and other scat to endYou make me feel so young
You make me feel so spring has sprung
And every time I see you grin
I'm such a happy individual

The moment that you speak
I wanna go play hide-and-seek
I wanna go and bounce the moon
Just like a toy balloon

You and I are just like a couple of tots
Running across the meadow
Picking up lots of forget-me-nots

You make me feel so young
You make me feel there are songs to be sung
Bells to be rung
And a wonderful fling to be flung

And even when I'm old and gray
I'm gonna feel the way I do today
'Cause you make me feel so young

You make me feel so young
You make me feel so spring has sprung
And every time I see you grin
I'm such a happy individual

The moment that you speak
I wanna go play hide-and-seek
I wanna go and bounce the moon
Just like a toy balloon

You and I are just like a couple of tots
Running across the meadow
Picking up lots of forget-me-nots

You make me feel so young
You make me feel there are songs to be sung
Bells to be rung
Wonderful fling to be flung

And even when I'm old and gray
I'm gonna feel the way I do today
'Cause you, you make me feel so young
You make me feel so young
You make me feel so young
Ooh, you make me feel so youngThey call you lady luck
But there is room for doubt
At times you have a very un-lady-like way
Of running out
Your on this date with me
The pickin's have been lush
And yet before the evening is over
You might give me the brush
You might forget your manners
You might refuse to stay
And so the best that I can do is pray
Luck be lady tonight
Luck be lady tonight
Luck if you've been a lady to begin with
Luck be a lady tonight
Luck let a gentleman see
Just how nice a dame you can be
I know the way you've treated other guys you've been with
Luck be a lady with me
A lady never leaves her escort
It isn't fair, it isn't nice
A lady doesn't wander all over the room
And blow on some other guys dice
Lets keep this party polite
Never get out of my sight
Stick with me baby, I'm the guy that you came in with
Luck be lady tonight
A lady never flirts with strangers
She'd have a heart, she'd be nice
A lady doesn't wander all over the room
And blow on some other guys dice
Lets keep this party polite
Never get out of my sight
Stick with me baby, I'm the guy that you came in with
Luck be lady tonight[Chorus: Frank Sinatra]
Oh, the weather outside is frightful
But the fire is so delightful
And since we've no place to go
Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow!
It doesn't show signs of stopping
And I brought some corn for popping
The lights are turned down low
Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow

[Verse 1: Frank Sinatra]
When we finally kiss goodnight
How I'll hate to go out in the storm
But if you really hold me tight
All the way home I'll be warm

[Verse 2. Frank Sinatra]
The fire is slowly dying
And my dear, we're still goodbying
But as long as you love me so
Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow

[Bridge: Swanson Quartet & (Frank Sinatra)]
He doesn't care if it's in below
He's sitting by the fire's gloosy glow
He don't care about the cold and the winds that blow
He just says, "Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow"
(Let It Snow!)
Oooooh-Wee goes the storm
Why should he worry when he's nice and warm
His gal by his side and the lights turned low
He just says, "Let it snow, let it snow"
(I Don't Care!)

[Chorus: Frank Sinatra & (Swanson Quartet)]
The weather outside Is frightful
But that fire Is ummm... delightful
Since we've no place to go
Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow!
It doesn't show signs of stopping
And I've brought lots of corn for popping
The lights are way down low
So let it snow, let it snow, let it snow!
(Let it snow!)

[Verse 1: Frank Sinatra]
When we've finally say goodnight
How I'll hate going out In a storm
But If you'll only hold me tight
All the way home I'll be warm

[Verse 2: All]
The fire is slowly dying
And my dear we're still goodbying
Long as you love me so
Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow![Part 1]
The falling leaves
Drift by the window
The autumn leaves
Of red and gold
I see your lips
The summer kisses
The sunburned hands
I used to hold
Since you went away
The days grow long
And soon I'll hear
Old winter's song
But I miss you most of all
My darling
When autumn leaves
Start to fall[Verse]
In the wee small hours of the morning
While the whole wide world is fast asleep
You lie awake and think about the girl
And never, ever think of counting sheep

[Chorus]
When your lonely heart has learned its lesson
You'd be hers if only she would call
In the wee small hours of the morning
That's the time you miss her most of all

[Interlude]

[Chorus]
When your lonely heart has learned its lesson
You'd be hers if only she would call
In the wee small hours of the morning
That's the time you miss her most of allWhy do I do just as you say
Why must I just give you your way
Why do I sigh
Why don't I try to forget

It must have been that something lovers call fate
Kept me saying "I had to wait"
I saw them all
Just couldn't fall 'til we met

It had to be you
It had to be you
I wandered around
And finally found
The somebody who
Could make me be true

And could make me be blue
And even be glad
Just to be sad
Thinking of you

Some others I've seen
Might never been mean
Might never be crossed
Or try to be bossed
But they wouldn't do

For nobody else
Gave me a thrill
With all your faults
I love you still
It had to be you
Wonderful you
It had to be you

For nobody else
Gave me a thrill
With all your faults
I love you still
It had to be you
Wonderful you
It had to be youNext time you're found, with your chin on the ground
There a lot to be learned, so look around

Just what makes that little old ant
Think he'll move that rubber tree plant
Anyone knows an ant, can't
Move a rubber tree plant

But he's got high hopes, he's got high hopes
He's got high apple pie, in the sky hopes

So any time you're gettin' low
'stead of lettin' go
Just remember that ant
Oops there goes another rubber tree plant

When troubles call, and your back's to the wall
There a lot to be learned, that wall could fall

Once there was a silly old ram
Thought he'd punch a hole in a dam
No one could make that ram, scram
He kept buttin' that dam

Cause he had high hopes, he had high hopes
He had high apple pie, in the sky hopes

So any time you're feelin' bad
'stead of feelin' sad
Just remember that ram
Oops there goes a billion kilowatt dam

All problems just a toy balloon
They'll be bursted soon
They're just bound to go pop
Oops there goes another problem kerplopOut of the tree of life I just picked me a plum
You came along and everything's startin' to hum
Still, it's a real good bet, the best is yet to come

Best is yet to come and babe, won't that be fine?
You think you've seen the sun, but you ain't seen it shine

A-Wait till the warm-up's underway
Wait till our lips have met
And wait till you see that sunshine day
You ain't seen nothin' yet

The best is yet to come and babe, won't it be fine?
Best is yet to come, come the day you're mine

Come the day you're mine
I'm gonna teach you to fly
We've only tasted the wine
We're gonna drain the cup dry

Wait till your charms are right for these arms to surround
You think you've flown before, but baby, you ain't left the ground

A-Wait till you're locked in my embrace
Wait till I draw you near
A-Wait till you see that sunshine place
Ain't nothin' like it here

The best is yet to come and babe, won't it be fine?
The best is yet to come, come the day you're mine

Come the day you're mine
And you're gonna be mineQuiet nights of quiet stars
Quiet chords from my guitar
Floating on the silence that surrounds us

Quiet thoughts and quiet dreams
Quiet walks by quiet streams
And a window looking on the mountains and the sea, oh how lovely

This is where I want to be
Here with you so close to me
Until the final flicker of life's ember

I who was lost and lonely
Believing life was only
A bitter tragic joke, have found with you, the meaning of existence, oh my love

I who was lost and lonely
Believing life was only
A bitter tragic joke, have found with you, the meaning of existence, oh my love[Verse 1]
It's quarter to 3
There's no one in the place
Except you and me
So set 'em up, Joe
I got a little story
I think you should know
We're drinkin' my friends
To the end
Of a brief episode

[Chorus]
Make it one for my baby
And one more for the road

[Verse 2]
I got the routine
Put another nickel
In the machine
Feelin' so bad
Can't you make the music
Easy and sad?
I could tell you a lot
But you've gotta be
True to your code

[Chorus]
Just make it one for my baby
And one more for the road

[Bridge]
You'd never know it
But buddy, I'm a kind of poet
And I've got a lot of things I'd like to say
And when I'm gloomy
Won't you listen to me
Till it's talked away?

[Verse 3]
Well, that's how it goes
And Joe, I know you're gettin'
Anxious to close
And thanks for the cheer
I hope you didn't mind
My bending your ear
But this torch that I've found
It's gotta be drowned
Or it soon might explode

[Chorus]
So make it one for my baby
And one more for the road

[Outro]
The long, it's so long
The long, very longShe gets too hungry for dinner at eight
She likes the theatre and never comes late
She never bothers with people she'd hate
That's why the lady is a tramp

Doesn't like crap games with barons or earls
Won't go to Harlem in ermine and pearls
Won't dish the dirt with the rest of the girls
That's why the lady is a tramp

She likes the free fresh wind in her hair
Life without care
She's broke and it's oke
Hates California, it's cold and it's damp
That's why the lady is a tramp

She gets too hungry to wait for dinner at eight
She loves the theatre but never comes late
She'd never bother with people she'd hate
That's why the lady is a tramp

She'll have no crap games with sharpies and frauds
And she won't go to Harlem in Lincolns or Fords
And she won't dish the dirt with the rest of the broads
That's why the lady is a tramp

She loves the free fresh wind in her hair
Life without care
She's broke but it's oke
Hates California, it's so cold and so damp
That's why the lady, that's why the lady
That's why the lady is a tramp[Verse]
Those fingers in my hair
That sly come-hither stare
That strips my conscience bare
It's witchcraft
And I've got no defense for it
The heat is too intense for it
What good would common sense for it do?

[Chorus 1]
'Cause it's witchcraft, wicked witchcraft
And although I know it's strictly taboo
When you arouse the need in me
My heart says "Yes, indeed" in me
"Proceed with what you're leadin' me to"

[Post-Chorus 1]
It's such an ancient pitch
But one I wouldn't switch
'Cause there's no nicer witch than you

[Chorus 2]
'Cause it's witchcraft, that crazy witchcraft
And although I know it's strictly taboo
When you arouse the need in me
My heart says "Yes, indeed" in me
"Proceed with what you're leadin' me to"

[Post-Chorus 2]
It's such an ancient pitch
But one that I'd never switch
'Cause there's no nicer witch than you[Chorus]
Jingle bells, jingle bells
Jingle all the way
Oh, what fun it is to ride
In a one-horse open sleigh
Jingle bells, jingle bells
Jingle all the way
Oh, what fun it is to ride
In a one-horse open sleigh

[Verse 1]
Dashing through the snow (Rudolph)
In a one-horse open sleigh (today)
O'er the fields we go (Rudolph)
Laughing all the way (today)
Bells on bob-tail ring
Making our spirits bright
What fun it is to ride and sing
A sleighing song tonight

[Chorus]
Jingle bells, jingle, jingle bells
Jingle all the way
Oh, what fun it is to ride
In a one-horse open sleigh

I love those JINGLE bells
Those holiday JINGLE bells
All those happy JINGLE BE double LES
I love those JINGLE bells

Jingle all the way

(Some other version:)
Dashing through the snow
In a one-horse open sleigh
Through the fields we go
Laughing all the way
Bells on bob-tail ring
Making spirits bright
What fun it is to ride and sing
A sleighing song tonight

Echo: Jingle bells, jingle bells
Jingle all the way
Oh what fun it is to ride
In a one-horse open sleigh, O
Jingle bells, jingle bells
Jingle all the way
Oh what fun it is to ride
In a one-horse open sleigh

A day or two ago
I thought I'd take a ride
And soon Miss Fanny Bright
Was seated by my side;
The horse was lean and lank
Misfortune seemed his lot
We ran into a drifted bank
And there we got upsot

A day or two ago
The story I must tell
I went out on the snow
And on my back I fell;
A gent was riding by
In a one-horse open sleigh
He laughed at me as
I there sprawling laid
But quickly drove away

Now the ground is white
Go it while you're young
Take the girls along
And sing this sleighing song
Just bet a bob-tailed bay
Two-forty as his speed
Hitch him to an open sleigh
And crack! You'll take the leadThe shadow of your smile
When you have gone
Will color all my dreams
And light the dawn

Look into my eyes, my love, and see
All the lovely things, you are, to me

Our wistful little star

It was far, too high
A teardrop kissed your lips
And so, so did i

Now when I remember spring
And every little lovely thing
I will be remembering
The shadow of your smile
Your lovely smile[Refrain]
I've got the world on a string
Sitting on a rainbow
Got the string around my finger
What a world, what a life, I'm in love

[Verse 1]
I've got a song that I sing
I can make the rain go
Anytime I move my finger
Lucky me, can't you see, I'm in love

[Pre-Chorus]
Life is a beautiful thing
As long as I hold the string
I'd be a silly so-and-so
If I should ever let it go

[Refrain]

[Pre-Chorus]

[Refrain]
I got the world on a string
Sitting on a rainbow
Got the string around my finger
What a world
And this is the life
Hey now
I'm so in loveMy story is much to sad to be told
But practically everything leaves me totally cold
The only exception I know is the case
When Im out on a quiet spree, fighting vainly the old ennui
Then I suddenly turn and see
Your fabulous face

I get no kick from champagne
Mere alcohol doesn't thrill me at all
So tell me why should it be true
That I get a kick out of you

Some, they may go for cocaine
I'm sure that if I took even one sniff
It would bore me terrifically, too
Yet I get a kick out of you

I get a kick every time I see you
Standing there before me
I get a kick though it's clear to see
You obviously don't adore me

I get no kick in a plane
Flyin' too high with some gal in the sky is my idea of nothing to do
Yet I get a kick
You give me a boot
I get a kick out of youWhen somebody loves you
Its no good unless he loves you...
All the way
Happy to be near you
When you need someone to cheer you
All the way

Taller than the tallest tree is
Thats how its got to feel
Deeper than the deep blue sea is
Thats how deep it goes if its real

When somebody needs you
Its no good unless she needs you
All the way

Through the good or lean years
And for all those in between years
Come what may

Who knows where the road will lead us
Only a fool would say
But if you let me love you
Its for sure I'm gonna love you
All the way

All the way...

So if you let me love you
Its for sure I'm gonna love you
All the way
All.. The ... Way...Fairy tales can come true, it can happen to you
If you're young at heart
For it's hard, you will find, to be narrow of mind
If you're young at heart

You can go to extremes with impossible schemes
You can laugh when your dreams fall apart at the seams
And life gets more exciting with each passing day
And love is either in your heart, or on it's way

Don't you know that it's worth every treasure on earth
To be young at heart
For as rich as you are, it's much better by far
To be young at heart

And if you should survive to 105
Look at all you'll derive out of being alive
And here is the best part, you have a head start
If you are among the very young at heart

And if you should survive to 105
Look at all you'll derive out of being alive
And here is the best part, you have a head start
If you are among the very young at heartIf you go away on this summer day
Then you might as well take the sun away;
All the birds that flew in the summer sky
When our love was new and our hearts were high;
When the day was young and the night was long
And the moon stood still for the night bird's song
If you go away, if you go away, if you go away
But if you stay, I'll make you a day
Like no day has been, or will be again;
We'll sail the sun, we'll ride on the rain
We'll talk to the trees and worship the wind
Then if you go, I'll understand
Leave me just enough love to fill up my hand
If you go away, if you go away, if you go away
If you go, as I know you will, you must tell the world to stop turning
Till you return again, if you ever do, for what good is love without loving you
Can I tell you now, as you turn to go, I'll be dying slowly till the next hello
If you go away, if you go away, if you go away
But if you stay, I'll make you a night
Like no night has been, or will be again
I'll sail on your smile, I'll ride on your touch
I'll talk to your eyes that I love so much
But if you go, go, I won't cry
Though the good is gone from the word goodbye
If you go away, if you go away, if you go away
If you go away, as I know you must
There'll be nothing left in the world to trust
Just an empty room, full of empty space
Like the empty look I see on your face
I'd have been the shadow of your shadow
If I thought it might have kept me by your side
If you go away, if you go away, if you go away
Please don't go awayThe summer wind, came blowin' in from across the sea
It lingered there, to touch your hair and walk with me
All summer long, we sang a song
And then we strolled that golden sand
Two sweethearts, and the summer wind

Like painted kites, those days and nights they went flyin' by
The world was new, beneath a blue umbrella sky
Then softer than, a piper man, one day it called to you
I lost you, I lost you to the summer wind

The autumn wind, and the winter winds
They have come and gone
And still the days, those lonely days they go on and on
And guess who sighs his lullabies
Through nights that never end
My fickle friend, the summer wind
The summer wind, warm summer wind, the summer wind[Verse 1]
I'm a fool to want you
I'm a fool to want you
To want a love that can't be true
A love that's there for others too

[Verse 2]
I'm a fool to hold you
Such a fool to hold you
To seek a kiss not mine alone
To share a kiss the Devil has known

[Chorus]
Time and time again I said I'd leave you
Time and time again I went away
But then would come the time when I would need you
And once again these words I'll have to say

[Verse 3]
Take me back, I love you
Pity me, I need you
I know it's wrong, it must be wrong
But right or wrong I can't get along
Without you[Verse 1]
Start spreadin' the news
I'm leavin' today
I want to be a part of it
New York, New York

[Verse 2]
These vagabond shoes
Are longing to stray
Right through the very heart of it
New York, New York

[Bridge]
I want to wake up
In a city that doesn't sleep
And find I'm king of the hill
Top of the heap...

[Verse 3]
These little-town blues
Are melting away
I'll make a brand new start of it
In old New York
If I can make it there
I'll make it anywhere
It's up to you
New York, New York
New York, New York

[Bridge]
I want to wake up in a city
That never sleeps
And find I'm "A" number one
Top of the list
King of the hill, "A" number one...

[Verse 4]
These...little town.... blues
Are...melting away
I'm gonna make a brand new start of it
In old New York

[Outro]
And... If I can make it there
I'm gonna make it anywhere
It's up to you
New York, New Yoooooooooork...
New Yooork!It's not the pale moon that excites me
That thrills and delights me, oh no
It's just the nearness of you

It isn't your sweet conversation
That brings this sensation, oh no
It's just the nearness of you

When youre in my arms and I feel you so close to me
All my wildest dreams come true

I need no soft lights to enchant me
If you'll only grant me the right
To hold you ever so tight
And to feel in the night the nearness of youHow glad the many millions of Annabelles and Lillians
Would be to capture me
But you had such persistence, you wore down my resistance
I fell and it was swell

I'm your big and brave and handsome Romeo
How I won you I shall never never know
It's not that you're attractive
But, oh, my heart grew active
When you came into view

I've got a crush on you, sweetie pie
All the day and night-time hear me sigh
I never had the least notion that
I could fall with so much emotion

Could you coo, could you care
For a cunning cottage we could share
The world will pardon my mush
'Cause I have got a crush on you

Could you coo, could you care
For a cunning cottage
That we could share
The world will pardon my mush
'Cause I have got a crush, my baby, on you[Verse 1]
Isn't it rich?
Are we a pair?
Me here at last on the ground
You in mid-air

Send in the clowns

[Verse 2]
Isn't it bliss?
Don't you approve?
One who keeps tearing around
One who can't move

Where are the clowns?
Send in the clowns

[Verse 3]
Just when I stopped
Opening doors
Finally knowing
The one that I wanted was yours

Making my entrance again
With my usual flair
Sure of my lines
No one is there

[Verse 4]
Don't you love a farce?
My fault, I fear
I thought that you'd want what I want
Sorry, my dear

But where are the clowns?
Send in the clowns
Don't bother
They're here

[Verse 5]
Isn't it rich?
Isn't it queer?
Losing my timing this late
In my career

Where are the clowns
There ought to be clowns
Well, maybe next year[Verse 1]
My ambition is attractive
My aggression isn't passive
I promise with you
The butterflies in my stomach are active
They're dancin', I'm feelin' static
Wanna get closer like magnets
Your company, I've been feinin'
I think I've turned to an addict
I don't get high
But lookin' in your eyes, I'm lifted
Can we make this tradition?
Your kisses make all my doubts go away (Go away)
Go away, yeah

[Chorus]
You only show me love
When it comes to the music
It's like when I feel lonely
That's when you start actin' choosey
I don't wanna keep playin' them games
'Cause I feel like I'm losin'
I don't wanna keep playin' them games
'Cause I feel like I'm losin'
What we doin'?
What we doin'?
What we doin'?
What we doin'?
Let me know
Let me know
What we doin'?

[Verse 2]
Been on my grind
I know that my schedule is busy
But I always make sure I call you
When I touch down in your city
I'll make time because you're worth it
Fall back when you don't deserve it
And I'll start losin' patience
When my effort's bein' wasted
I've been tryna ride
Can't you see I'm on your side?
But it's killin' me
Tryna make sure that both of us survive
And love, I haven't got enough practice
All the ones before you were just a mistake
Or just a distraction
So tell me what's happenin'

[Chorus]
You only show me love
When it comes to the music
It's like when I feel lonely
That's when you start actin' choosey
I don't wanna keep playin' them games
'Cause I feel like I'm losin'
I don't wanna keep playin' them games
'Cause I feel like I'm losin'
What we doin'?
What we doin'?
What we doin'?
What we doin'?
Let me know
Let me know
What we doin'?

[Interlude]
What we doin'?
What we doin'? Yeah
What we doin'?
What we doin'? Yeah

[Outro]
Now I'll leave it up to you
Do what you gotta do
Like the watch I just got for you
I'll give you some time
I ain't gonna wait
I ain't gonna wait
For you, for you, for you
For you, for you, for you
What are we doin'? What are we doin'?
What are we doin'? What are we doin'?
What are we doin'? What are we doin'?
Tell me, what are we doin'?[Chorus]
Me (Me, me, me)
Can you focus on me? (Me, me)
Baby, can you focus on me? (Focus on me)
Babe

[Verse 1]
Hands in the soap (Soap)
Have the faucets running
And I keep looking at you
(Looking at you, looking at you)
Stuck on your phone
And you're stuck in your zone
You don't have a clue

[Pre-Chorus]
But I don't wanna give up (Give up, give up)
Baby, I just want you to get up (Get up, get up)
Lately, I've been a little fed up (Fed up, fed up)
Wish you would just focus on

[Chorus]
Me
Can you focus on me?
Baby, can you focus on me?
Me, me
Can you focus on me?
Baby, can you focus on me?

[Verse 2]
Lazy and broke? (Broke)
No, he get this money
So I guess I can't complain
But I feel alone even when we're alone
And that don't cost a thing

[Pre-Chorus]
But I don't wanna give up
Baby, I just want you to get up
Lately, I've been a little fed up (A little fed up, yeah)
Wish you would just focus on

[Chorus]
Me
Can you focus on me? (Ooh, yeah)
Baby, can you focus on me?
Me, me
Can you focus on me?
Baby, can you focus on me?

[Outro]
Baby, baby, focus
Can't you see?
I just wanna love you, baby
Look me in my eyes, ooh[Intro: H.E.R.]
Please, allow me to show you something
Mmm, somebody give me, yeah

[Verse 1: H.E.R.]
Somebody give me, uh
Somebody tell me the answers
Me and you isn't the answer (Uh)
Me and you isn't (No)
Maybe I'm tellin' myself that
But there ain't nothin' that'll change that
What good would it be if I knew how you felt about me? (Yeah)

[Pre-Chorus: H.E.R.]
It could've been right, but I was wrong (Uh)
Only think 'bout you when I'm alone (Yeah)
The part of me that cared inside is gone
And I know that I can't get caught up

[Chorus: H.E.R.]
We could've been
And we try to pretend
Every now and again
We don't dream about, don't think about what
We could've been
Though I'm holding it in
'Cause I know in the end
You dream about, I think about what
We could've been
We could've been (Yeah)
We could've (Damn)

[Verse 2: H.E.R.]
Remember?
Remember the night in Miami?
First time you put your arms around me
I'm up reminiscin' (Ooh, yeah)
And thinking 'bout you isn't helping
Thinking 'bout you doesn't tell me
What good it would do if I decide to face the truth

[Bridge: H.E.R.]
It could've been right, but I was wrong
Only think 'bout you when I'm alone
You only hit me up when she's not home
And that's why I can't get caught up

[Chorus: H.E.R.]
We could've been
And we try to pretend
Every now and again
We don't dream about, don't think about what
We could've been (Oh yeah)
Though I'm holding it in
'Cause I know in the end
You dream about, I think about what
We could've been, we could've been
We could've, we could've been
What we could've been, we could've been

[Post-Chorus]
What we could've been, yeah
What we could've been

[Verse 3: Bryson Tiller & H.E.R.]
Ayy
What we could've been
What we should've been
If I wasn't, if I wasn't with somebody
If you gotta hide it, what's the point of trying?
I ain't just your friend, no, what's the point of lying?
Tryna sell a story ain't nobody buyin'
Look me in my eyes, don't that feel nice?
Why should it end? Baby, I could've been
I could've been him, more than your friend
Just say where and when, where to make a trip
Baby, make a wish, be the one I'm with
Shouldve been a, should've, could've, would have been, ayy
Yeah, I would have been (Damn)
Yeah, I would have been (Yeah)

[Outro: H.E.R.]
Damn, damn (Could've been)
Yeah, we could've been (Oh no)[Verse 1]
Baby, the sound of you
Better than a harmony
I want you off my mind
And on me
Holding me closer than we've ever been before
This ain't a dream
You're here with me
Boy, it don't get no better than you
For you, I wanna take my time
All night

[Chorus]
I wanna love you in every kind of way
I wanna please you, no matter how long it takes
If the world should end tomorrow and we only have today
I'm gonna love you in every kind of way

[Verse 2]
Give you all, give you all of me
When you need it
'Cause I need it
I wanna fall like your favorite season
I'll never get up
Stay here forever, babe
It don't get no better than this
Your kiss

[Chorus]
I wanna love you in every kind of way
I wanna please you, no matter how long it takes
If the world should end tomorrow and we only have today
I'm gonna love you in every kind of way
I wanna love you in every kind of way
I wanna please you, no matter how long it takes
If the world should end tomorrow and we only have today
I'm gonna love you in every kind of way

[Outro]
I wanna love you
I gotta love you
I wanna love you
I gotta love you[Verse 1]
Right now my head is a mess
Thinking 'bout you got me stressed
But you could probably care less
You're just so hard to impress
Every time that we go out
You do something to show out
Played the fool, but I know now

I always worry 'bout you ('Bout you)
I only tell you the truth (Truth)
I'm not like those other girls
I don't be acting brand new
Every time that we go out
You do something to show out
Played the fool, but I know now

[Chorus]
It could be U-S
There's too many letters
But it's only you, only you
Only, only, only you, only you

[Verse 2]
My friends say you not about me
I wasn't tryna believe it
I'm always holding you down
Even though you mess around
You ain't showing me no love
You just want me to show off
Played the fool but I know now

[Chorus]
It could be U-S
There's too many letters
But it's only you, only you
Only, only, only you, only you
It could be U-S
There's too many letters
But it's only you, only you
Only, only, only you, only you

[Bridge]
Boy, I wish that you would see
This could be us
Ooh, I'm so tired of you taking advantage of love

[Chorus]
It could be U-S (Could be U-S)
There's too many letters
But it's only you, only you (Only you)
Only, only, only you, only you (Why's it gotta be only you)
It could be U-S (U-S)
There's too many letters
But it's only you, only you (It's only you, it's only you)
Only, only, only you, only you (It's only you, it's only you)[Intro: H.E.R.]
Oh, hey

[Verse 1: H.E.R.]
You don't know babe
When you hold me
And kiss me slowly
It's the sweetest thing
And it don't change
If I had it my way
You would know that you are

[Pre-Chorus 1: H.E.R.]
You're the coffee that I need in the morning
You're my sunshine in the rain when it's pouring
Won't you give yourself to me
Give it all, oh

[Chorus: H.E.R. & Daniel Caesar]
I just wanna see
I just wanna see how beautiful you are
You know that I see it
I know you're a star
Where you go I'll follow
No matter how far
If life is a movie
Oh you're the best part, oh
Then you're the best part, ooh
Best part

[Verse 2: Daniel Caesar]
It's this sunrise
And those brown eyes, yes
You're the one that I desire
When we wake up
And then we make love (Make love)
It makes me feel so nice

[Pre-Chorus 2: Daniel Caesar]
You're my water when I'm stuck in the desert
You're the Tylenol I take when my head hurts
You're the sunshine on my life

[Chorus: Daniel Caesar & H.E.R.]
I just wanna see how beautiful you are
You know that I see it
I know you're a star
Where you go I'll follow
No matter how far
If life is a movie
Then you're the best part, oh
You're the best part, ooh
Best part

[Outro: Daniel Caesar & H.E.R.]

These days these new girls, they got me nervous
(Put a bib on me)
They go to school and do bottle service
They can't decide, they keep switching majors
(Put a bib on me)
Being indecisive makes me anxious
Call your number and it's out of service
(Rock me real slowly)
Who can I call for your information?
What am I supposed to do
After we done everything that we've done?
Who is your replacement?
Are we still good? Are we still good? (Put a bib on me)
Are we still good? Are we still good?

[Verse 1]
I wanna run away with you
Just take me to places I've never known
When no one else seems to be getting through
Only you can tell what's going on

[Pre-Chorus]
When I hear your name
Put a smile up on my face
It don't matter the time or the place
You make it all better now
I could love you forever now
When I hear the sound
When I'm feeling down
Ain't nobody else gotta be around
For you to make it better now
Let me get myself together now

[Chorus]
Let me sing my song
Don't wanna be alone
I know that when I listen
I find what I've been missing
Right here in my heart
Let me sing my song
I know this is my home
All that I've been wishing
I found what I've been missing
You were right here from the start
So let me sing my song

[Verse 2]
Everything that you've told me
I thank you every day for
All the things you wanted me to be
Is every thing I've prayed for
When the weight of the world is on my shoulders
You would take the away the pain (take away the pain)
Through the storm the sun still shines
With you by my side I'm not afraid

[Pre-Chorus]
When I hear you name
Put a smile up on my face
It don't matter the time or the place
You make it all better now
I could love you forever now
When I hear the sound
When I'm feeling down
Ain't nobody else gotta be around
For you to make it better now
Let me get myself together now

[Chorus]
Let me sing my song
Don't wanna be alone
I know that when I listen
I find what I've been missing
Right here in my heart
Let me sing my song
I know this is my home
All that I've been wishing
Found what I've been missing
You were right here from the start
So let me sing my song

[Verse 3]
All my doubts and fears
All my cries and tears
They all just disappear
When ever you, were near
You are still right here
You are still, oh right here
Right here
Right here
Right here
Still right here
Right here
Right here, right here, right here
Right here, right here
Right here, here
Right here, here, here, here
Right here
Right here[Verse 1]
Come mess with a real one
If you're one in a million
Don't let a lot of people in
But you get admission
And I don't let my walls down
But I see us building
And you ain't a feeling
'Cause that's how I'm feeling

[Pre-Chorus]
You make me wanna put my phone down
When we're alone, I wanna zone out
Baby, with you, I ain't got no doubts
I'm just trying to let you know now

[Chorus]
Facts
You were the one I was missing
The opposite of fiction
And that's facts
Ooh, it's a given
I don't care 'bout opinions
And that's facts, facts
And that's facts
You were the one I was missing

[Verse 2]
Just the beginning
It don't get no better
As long as you hold me down
I'll be up for whatever
And I love the way you look at me
'Cause I see forever
Was ready before
But I want you now more than ever

[Pre-Chorus]
You make me wanna put my phone down
When we're alone, I wanna zone out
Baby, with you, I ain't got no doubts
I'm just trying to let you know now

Mmm, mmm-hmm, mmm-hmm, mmm, eh

[Verse 1]
Wanna believe what you say
But I hate you on most days
You've been testing my faith and my patience, yeah
And you know that I be head strong
But you know that you be dead wrong
Telling me to relax when I'm reacting

[Pre-Chorus]
But I, I'd rather fight
Than lose sleep at night
At least you're all mine
And if I have to choose
My heart or you
I'm gonna lose, yeah

[Chorus]
What if nothing ever will change?
Oh, I'm caught between your love and a hard place
Oh, I wish there was a right way
I'm caught between your love and a hard place, oh
Woah, oh oh woah, oh oh woah, oh oh woah

[Verse 2]
Do I even have a choice when-
I'm gonna have to pick my poison
Yeah, you hurt me so good, it's so good
And even when you cause tears
You're the one who wiped them away
Maybe that's the reason I stay, I stay

[Pre-Chorus]
But I, I'd rather fight
Than lose sleep at night
At least you're all mine
And if I have to chose
My heart or you
I'm gonna lose

[Chorus]
What if nothing ever will change?
Oh, I'm caught between your love and a hard place
Oh, I wish there was a right way
I'm caught between your love and a hard place, oh
Woah, oh oh woah, oh oh woah, oh oh woah

What if nothing ever will change?
I'm caught between your love and a hard place
Ooh, I wish there was a right way, yeah
I'm caught between your love and a hard place, ooh woah ooh
Woah, oh oh woah, oh oh woah, oh oh woah

Oh, I'm caught between your love and a hard place
Woah, oh oh woah, oh oh woah, oh oh woah
Oh, I wish there was a right way
Woah, oh oh woah, oh oh woah, oh oh woah
I'm caught between your love and a hard place, oh
Woah, oh oh woah, oh oh woah, oh oh woah

[Outro]
I'm caught between your love and a hard place
What if nothing will ever change?
I'm caught between your love and a hard place[Verse 1]
Lately, I been going through some changes
Been running out of maybes
Boy I know you're losing patience
Losing patience
Losing patience with me

[Pre-Chorus]
Sometimes I get fed up with all the games
Sometimes you all just act the same
Maybe I'm the one to blame
That's just how the game goes
When you're feeling alone
Everybody got somebody that they mess with on the low
Now I just want you to save me
I just want you to save me, Ohhhh

[Chorus]
We got options
But I just wanna let you know that I decided
I finally realized that
All I want is you
You, you, you
You, you, ooo
All I want is you
You, you, you
You, you, ooo

[Verse 2]
I ain't like all them other girls
You can't treat me like them other girls no more
(no mooore)
You see me like another girl
I've been waiting for you to make a move
(ohhh, oh, oh)

[Pre-Chorus 2]
You know that I'm fed up with all the games
You all just act the same
Maybe I'm the one to blame
That's just how the game goes
Just want someone to hold
Everybody needs somebody to be there when they're alone
I just want you to save me (yea)
Just want you to save me

[Chorus]
We got options
But I just wanna let you know that I decided
I finally realized that
All I want is you
You, you, you
You, you, ooo
All I want is you
You, you, you
You, you, ooo[Intro]
Mmm
Yeah yeah, yeah yeah, uh (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Yeah (Da da, da da)
Oh yeah, uh

[Verse 1]
I should've listened to my intuition
I put myself in this position
It's all my fault, look in the mirror
Think, "What am I missin'?"

[Pre-Chorus]
See and think different, oh, am I lost?
Feelin' a way, nothing's the same
I wish you would change, oh, I'm lost
Numbin' the pain don't make it okay
Nothin' to say, but

[Chorus]
You brought all the issues (Issues)
And mine was staying with you
Don't hold it against me ('Gainst me)
Against me ('Gainst me)
Hold it against me, against me (Yeah)
And I don't trust you lately
And if that makes me crazy
Can't hold it against me ('Gainst me)
Against me ('Gainst me)
Hold it against me (Yeah), yeah (Oh)

[Verse 2]
Feel like I'm driftin'
Know he notice the distance
And love ain't been blockin' my vision
But that ain't my fault (My fault)
That he was the difference
You let him get in that position

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm too comfortable now
Ain't feelin' a way, nothing's the same
I think every day that we're lost, yeah
And love ain't enough, but it's holdin' me up
Love ain't enough 'cause

[Chorus]
You brought all the issues (Yeah)
And mine was staying with you (Staying with you)
Don't hold it against me ('Gainst me)
Against me ('Gainst me)
Hold it against me, against me
And I don't trust you lately (Say I don't trust you)
And if that makes me crazy (If that makes me)
Can't hold it against me ('Gainst me)
Against me (Yeah, yeah)
Hold it against me ('Gainst me), yeah ('Gainst me)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh
Oh, oh, yeah (Against me)

[Outro]
To my women with the utmost respect, intellect
We often forget and neglect
Intuition can see through elusive intent, listen to it
(Just listen, just listen, oh)
I found myself searching for a way to prevent, the detriment
And giving the impression that if you express to him what a woman needs, his comprehension is definite
But there's a difference between understanding and honoring your word
And I'm articulate, he's a good listener
But I'm hesitant 'cause he's gonna fuck up anyways
(Baby just listen, listen, listen, oh)
In the corners of a man's mind
There's a place where vulnerability hides
And intimacy is not the act of physical intertwine
But it's the isolation of two minds
That's why he keeps his heart and his head separate
There's only one he can connect with
The multiple names on the checklist
Only calls when he's desperate
I guess it's too much pressure to be respectful and honest
It's too stressful to be keepin' promises and I'm impatient
I'm too high maintenance
Way too many expectations when we're just dating
But I'm special, right?
Deny, deny, deny
All you do is lie, word is bond, right?
But not with me because I don't know what it's like
I'll never understand the needs of a man or how to nurture
And what she doesn't know can't hurt her
But nah, it's deep and you know it
I told you exactly what I wanted
And that love is exhausting, but I'm not tired of you yet
(Oh, no, woah, no)
To my women with the utmost respect, intellect
We often forget and neglect
Intuition can see through elusive intent, listen to it[Chorus]
The things that I would do to you with just a couple seconds
I would color every moment, make you feel like it's forever
I'm comin' over, so you can start undressin'
I'm givin' you a chance to finally make a good impression
On me, yeah
On me, I'll make you feel like it's forever

[Verse 1]
Because it's clear I'm getting bigger
I know you visualize my figure
I was the one that made you look
At your old girl and reconsider
You see me in that black dress
On the first date
And I'm causin' frustration on your mind
Only in the best ways

Secretly I'm anxious, 'cause the thirst has never been mutual
It's unusual
That someone like you thinks I'm beautiful
It's beautiful, yeah
What we had was beautiful
Remember when you said...

[Chorus]
The things that I would do to you with just a couple seconds
I would color every moment
Make you feel like it's forever baby
I'm coming over so you can start undressing
I hope this is my chance
To finally make a good impression
On you, on you

[Verse 2]
But just when you think you have forever
He has you lost in your emotions
And you hate feeling so alone
And you're sinking because you know
You shouldn't have stayed until the morning
It wasn't worth all of the heartache
It wasn't worth all of the pleasure
Because you once were a diamond
He made you feel like buried treasure I guess

Nothing lasts forever
Nothing lasts forever baby
Nothing lasts forever

[Chorus]
The things that I loved to do you with just a couple seconds
You colored every moment, made it feel like it's forever
And after a while we lost a real connection
And I realized there's others using the time
We've been spending
No more, no more

[Outro]
I'm still lost, holding in all of the anger at the bottom of the ocean
And I thought you'd be my savior
I was distracted, unaware of his behavior
But when I started drowning I didn't know he was the anchor[Verse 1]
It's cool
It's really never been that deep
Wasnt thinking 'bout you
'Cause you didnt give a fuck about me
Thought I was up in my room
Crying myself to sleep
I was with a better you
While you were busy playing me

[Chorus]
I was playing you too-too-too
I was playing you too-too-too

[Verse 2]
Thought I wouldn't find out
Thought I didnt know how to play the game
Coulda screamed at you for hours
Instead I was screaming somebody elses name
There are no rules
Now I can do whatever I want
I can never lose
So its funny how you thought you won

[Chorus]
But I was playing too-too-too
I was playing you too-too-too
I was playing you too-too-too
I was playing you too-too-too
Too-too-too
I was playing you too-too-too
I was playing you too-too-too
I was playing you too-too-too
Too-too-too
Too-too-too[Verse 1]
I liked you better on the first date
I shoulda said what's wrong in the first place
I don't 'cause you always takin' it the wrong way
You won't listen you're too busy playin' 2K
I always been down but you still sleep
And even though I said that night I shouldn't been peaked
I feel it in my soul yeah it's so deep
So deep you should know that about me

[Chorus]
I just turned just turned down your avenue
I had to but I'm mad at you
You always say I got a attitude
But that's you, you was actin' rude
I had to ask you if you had a few
Because you always say I got a attitude

[Verse 2]
Why you talkin' to me like, you be like
Why you always wanna be right?
Oh I just need the time that you can't find
I just need to know that it's still mine
And the way that you can't say my name don't seem right
But I know when to go and to stop at the green light

[Chorus]
I just turned, just turned down your avenue
I had to but I'm mad at you
You always say I got a attitude
But that's you, you was actin' rude
I had to ask you if you had a few
Because you always say I got a attitude

[Bridge]
So I'm the one that's out of place
I'm the one that's in a way
I don't communicate
I'm so spoiled
So I'm the one that need a break
Like you ain't stay in my place
But you're the one who came home late
And I ain't loyal

That's you yeah that's you yeah that's you...

[Chorus]
I just turned, just turned down your avenue
I had to but I'm mad at you
You always say I got a attitude
But that's you, you was actin' rude
I had to ask you if you had a few
Because you always say I got a attitude[Verse 1]
Say, why I'm lookin' at way
You ain't do nothin' wrong
I'm wildin'
It's five I waited up last night
Said you got too high
I'm tired

[Pre-Chorus 1]
So you want me to give you honesty
Said you wanted every piece of me
You don't wanna hear me out tonight
I just turn around and say goodnight

[Chorus]
You don't feel a way
You're gone away
You don't listen
You promised you wouldn't change
It'd stay the same
But it's different
We were much happier when
It was always happy endings

[Verse 2]
Wait maybe it's just a phase
Took a minute for you to say 'I'm sorry'
Don't ask if you really don't wanna hear it
When I'm tellin' you how I feel
You're bothered

[Pre-Chorus]
Said you want me to give you honesty
Said you wanted every piece of me
You don't wanna hear me loud tonight
Don't let me turn around and say goodbye

[Chorus]
You don't feel a way
You're gone away
You don't listen
You promised it wouldn't change
It'd stay the same
But it's different
We were much happier when
It was always happy endings

[Outro]
You have the right to feel a way
I tried to change you
I'm just scared you're gone away
You promised it would stay the same (same)[Verse 1]
If I don't say nothing
What would make you think something
I just wanna chill
I don't wanna feel
But I could see this coming and
I shoulda' known better
I shoulda' known better
Trust me I'm not frontin' if I'm not feelin' ya
Don't give me your feelings yeah

[Chorus]
You can't make me love you If I don't
You can't make me love you if I won't
You can't change my heart, you're tryin' too hard
You can't make me love you no I won't, I won't

[Verse 2]
If I'm not into you
Don't hit me with the interview
Askin' all the questions
You don't have to call
I don't wanna talk
What gave you the impression that I would be down?
Really got you down
Shoulda' known better
Cause I'm not feelin' ya
Don't get in your feelings yeah

[Chorus]
You can't make me love you If I don't
You can't make me love you if I won't

Love you, love you
You can't make me love you If I don't

But if I'm next to you

Just layin' in this bed

[Pre-Chorus]
Ooh, that never gets old
Promise you'll never let go

You'd be a fool to not take me as I am

[Verse 2]
You're like the sweetest thing I know
Like my favorite Lauryn song
And I need you really bad, oh yeah
Don't take me for granted
You'll be regretting it
Oh, I should be your last, oh yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
Ooh, that never gets old
Promise you'll never let go
Grass ain't green nowhere else
So we should be chillin' back
Ain't nothin' wrong with that
So tell me that, tell me that

[Chorus]
Tell me I'm the best, aw, yeah (Aw, yeah)
I'll be feelin' like, yes, I am, I am

You know I'm the best, aw, yeah
You'd be a fool to not take me as I am[Verse 1]
Sick to my stomach
Four in the morning, I can't sleep
In and out the city
I'm worried 'bout where you may be
Feels like I've been here
Stressing the things that I can see
Where do you go? What do you do?
Without me, without me

[Chorus]
I'm not okay, I'm not okay
I'm not okay, no, I'm not okay
I'm not okay, no, I'm not okay
I'm not okay
Losing my faith, I'm losing my faith
Slipping away, you're slipping away
I'm not okay, no, I'm not okay
I'm not okay

[Verse 2]
Feel a little guilty, uh
I feel like it's written all over me
Tryna find a balance, trusting you, trusting me
Feel a little heavy
Holdin' onto something that I don't need
I've been going through it, yeah
I've been going through it

[Chorus]
I'm not okay, I'm not okay
I'm not okay, no, I'm not okay

Slipping away, you're slipping away
I'm not okay, no, I'm not okay
I'm not okay[Intro]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, mmm
Mmm

[Verse 1]
I'm lost
Is it really even my fault?
I don't think that it's supposed to be hard
If it's really meant to be
So give me a sign
Is he always gonna be mine?
Have I given it enough of my time?
You cannot blame if it don't mean nothing

[Chorus]
Sweet, sweet fate
I had about all I can take
Am I living in the bed that I made?
Is it yours? I wonder
Sweet, sweet fate (Sweet, sweet fate)
Oh if it's really out of my hands (If it's really out of my hands)
Can you forgive all of my sins? (Can you forgive all of my sins?)
Have mercy on me, me

[Verse 2]
Why me?
If you walked a mile using my feet
You would go a little easy on me
You'd know where I'm coming from, yeah
How come, when I'm lookin' at everyone
They get away with havin' their fun?
I'm paying these dues when they don't mean nothing

[Chorus]
Sweet, sweet fate
I had about all I can take
Am I living in the bed that I made?
Is it yours? I wonder
Sweet, sweet fate (Sweet, sweet fate)
Oh if it's really out of my hands (If it's really out of my hands)
Can you forgive all of my sins? (Can you forgive all of my sins?)
Have mercy on me, me[Verse 1]
Say, "Come over," but you won't let me in, in
You don't talk to me, you're too busy living in your head, head, ooh

[Pre-Chorus]
I don't know if it's worth it
I'm walking on air
Barely scratching the surface
It's like you're not here
Saying it on purpose
Admit that you're scared
It ain't fair, ooh

[Chorus]
Why we always at war?
What am I here for?
'Cause you know I really don't wanna be in the way
Just wanna make you feel safe
Let, let, let (let me in)
Let, let (let me in)

[Verse 2]
Say you're misunderstood, you claim nobody cares, cares
I can't tell if you just save your mind for someone else, else

[Pre-Chorus]
I don't know if it's worth it
I'm walking on air
Barely scratching the surface
It's like you're not here
Saying it on purpose
Admit that you're scared
I wanna be there, ooh

[Chorus]
Why we always at war?
What am I here for?
'Cause you know I really don't wanna be in the way
Just wanna make you feel safe
Let, let, let (let me in)
Let, let (let me in)
(Let me in, yeah)

[Bridge]
Aw yeah (let me in, let me in)
You puttin' up a wall
You ain't pick up my call
I'll still be there regardless (I'll still be there, yeah)
No, I don't understand
You never let me in
I know you ain't heartless (ooh)
If it's mine, if it's mine
I'm getting impatient 'cause I've been giving it time, baby

So let me in

[Chorus]
Why we always at war?
What am I here for?
'Cause you know I really don't wanna be in the way
Just wanna make you feel safe

Don't you ever play around, even when you're mad, you're mine
Baby, don't you ever switch sides
You know I can see it in your eyes
Yeah, we on the same page, we on the same wave
Drinkin' champagne on the airplane
Bustdown on your pinkies and your earrings
I know they call me Boogie Man, but it ain't scary
All this money on me, it's a damn shame
And I don't want you to ever feel embarrassed
So I bought you some baguettes, I bought you some carats
Yeah, but I think I was over my head, movin' too fast

[Chorus: H.E.R.]
Doin' our thing, movin' too fast
Candy paint with the windows all black

[Verse 4: Chris Brown]
You gon' keep on givin' it up, it ain't no stoppin' you
You a queen, liftin' you up, I had to drop a few
Bad bitches, cut 'em loose, they tried to take that spot from you
Told her, "I'm tryna cuff," she said, "I don't see no cop in you"
Diamonds big as a fist, VVS on her wrist
Every day a vacation, don't get no hotter than this
Relax, baby, lay it back, askin' you to sit right down
Buttnaked on the table, you the shit right now
Fake love don't exist
When it come to me and who I'm really fuckin' with
Haters always on my dick, but not the one suckin' it
Always lookin' at my pic', callin' me by my government
What's the plan? What's your goals? What you really lookin' for?
I got Benz, I got Ghost, I'm the man, I'm the G.O.A.T.
Makin' angels in the snow, don't keep playin' with your nose
Take a stroll down the coast
South of France, we in Cannes, let me drive the boat

[Chorus: H.E.R.]
Doin' our thing, movin' too fast
Candy paint with the windows all black
Seats crme brle, what they gon' say?

When you need the time, I won't have it
I'll try not to make it a habit
But I can't promise that
Wish I could do that
Cause you deserve
Actions and not words
And you know that I'm worth
Waiting for
While I'm out on tour

[Chorus]
Tell me right now
Are you still down?

Don't start that talk like you ain't planned to stay

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, I hate when you do that shit (Oh)
Now I'm bringin' up the past shit (Oh)

Yeah, oh, ooh
Don't make me feel

Na na, na na, na[Intro]
One, two, one

[Spoken Words]
Everyday I pray for mankind
We're all slaves to a generation socialized and sickness is in the mind
We are habitual thinkers, substance abusers and habitual drinkers
But free your mind because the plug is watching from the top floor, hoping you too would fall for the illusions of a temporary high
When we think, we need to get by
But are we really trying when kids are dying and depression is trending?
Are these the signs of an Armageddon?
We're all in denial and it's all cool until you're suicidal
We never learn from our so called idols
We're just repeating the cycle so-
I never read the news anymore, it's hard not to feel hopeless
When no one noticed, the explosion came from a man who's legal gun was loaded
It's all watered down and sugarcoated
We voted but did we really get to choose?
We don't need proof that they separate us from the truth
Mothers and fathers are being separated from their youth
And they're selling the American Dream and what it appears to be
But they don't teach us that wealth is unattainable with their currency
History, is not my brother's story
The original founders were buried in the ground where men have planted seeds of disease
And they've justified being thieves
Feeding their inner demons and blaming the minorities
It's a World War III, corruption versus greed
Not you versus me
But do we ever think, of the need for inner peace?
They can't put a price on your soul, don't matter your religion, right and wrong is something everybody knows
They pick and choose what's equal
Who's good and who's evil
And this is the devil's world but the Lord is coming for his people

[Break]

[Verse 1]
We're like Daniel in the den
Surrounded by these hungry lions
Looking in the jaws of death
We reach for saving hands
No help will come from then
The Lord is coming

[Verse 2]
Well the Red Sea's closing in
There's no safety in almighty horses
Can you feel the drivin' wind?
Behold the crashing waves
The Savior's on it's way
The Lord is coming

[Chorus]
Coming, coming
Hurry, hurry
Bring us to the promise land
Glory, glory, we'll reach for saving hands
No help will come from then
The Lord is coming

[Verse 3]
All you people of the land
Down beneath the weight of all your sorrows
Turn around while you still can
There's no guarantee you'll see tomorrow
The doors are open wide
Surrender to the light
The Lord is coming

[Chorus]
Coming, coming
Hurry, hurry
Bring us to the promise land
Oh glory, glory, we'll reach for saving hands
No help will come from then
The Lord is coming

[Outro]
The Lord is coming
The Lord is coming
The Lord is coming
Glory, glory, glory
The Lord is coming
Ooh[Verse 1]
Stare out the window
Oh, why am I so
Jaded and waiting for some kinda miracle? Yeah
Love doesn't live here
And I've cried enough tears
Sorry if I can't imagine that you care, oh

[Chorus]
Please
I never saw it coming
You wanna take me away
So please
Don't let it be for nothing
Before we get carried away, yeah

[Verse 2]
Ain't my fault I'm guarded
I'm good, I've been okay
Fronting, I don't wanna be loved anyway
And that's why I do as I say
'Cause I had a bad case
Losing a game I never wanted to play, oh

[Chorus]
Please
I never saw it coming
You wanna take me away
So please
Don't let it be for nothing
Before we get carried away, yeah

[Bridge]
Before we cross the line
I, I don't wanna take my chances if this ain't it, oh no
If you're not sure, then let me go, ooh

[Chorus]
Please
I never saw it coming
You wanna take me away
So please
Don't let it be for nothing
Before we get carried away
Before we get carried away, yeah[Verse 1]
Where'd you go?
Who you know?
How I've been living without you
Daydreaming on a cloud with you like horizon
With you 'til the night ends on a island, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
It's about time for making up
The times you wasn't with me waking up
Lying if I said I didn't miss your touch
I needed to, I needed to
Needed to distance myself from you
Oh, just to know you were the truth
So come closer, won't you? Won't you?

[Chorus]
Can I tell you something, for what it's worth?
With you, Heaven is a place on Earth
And I will take you there, I'll take you
Show you something, give you more than words
With you, Heaven is a place on Earth
And I will take you there, I'll take you there
Take you there

[Verse 2]
Fill me up 'til my cup's overflowing
I'm so anxious just to feel the silence
It's so quiet, but I hear you
Saying to me baby

[Pre-Chorus]
It's about time for making up (Time for making up)
The times you wasn't with me waking up
Lying if I said I didn't miss your touch
I needed to, I needed to
Needed to distance myself from you (You)
Oh, just to know you were the truth (Oh)
So come closer, won't you? Won't you?

[Chorus]
Can I tell you something, for what it's worth?
With you, Heaven is a place on Earth
And I will take you there, I'll take you
Show you something, give you more than words
With you, Heaven is a place on Earth
And I will take you there, I'll take you there, yeah
Take you there

[Bridge]
Keep me, please me, don't tease me
Love me, give me that feeling
I want you to give it to me, yeah, yeah
Keep me, please me, don't tease me
Love me, give me that feeling
I want you to give it to me, yeah, yeah

[Outro]
Yeah, woah
Take me high, high[Intro]
Confusing self-conscious with self-confidence
Confusing self-conscious with self-confidence
Confusing self-conscious with self-confidence, uh, yeah

[Verse 1]
Confusing self-conscious with self-confidence
So you monogamous, but body positive
Post pills you swallowing for a following
What he got to offer? He don't see the kids that he fathering
If you don't bother then, why you responding then?
Careful where you plant them seeds before you water them
Say you empower women (Ayy)
But don't acknowledge them (Nah, nah)
Feminism not what you embodyin'
You false hope, you false positive, uh
But eat your fruit and drink your water then, uh

Rep your set, then y'all switch up and don't pick up
But real friends don't ask for favors (Nah)
Say you betrayed like you supposed to pay 'em
Copped the White House like you supposed to save 'em
Ungrateful, wonder how I Kanye'd 'em, han
It's pressure to be an icon baby, han
Stressin' to be an icon lately, but

[Chorus]
A lost soul can't lead the people, no
A lost soul can't lead the people, nah
A lost soul can't lead the people, no
A lost soul can't lead the people, uh

[Verse 2]
Confusing the celebrity with your integrity
You drinkin' Hennessy for your therapy

Married to the mula, still aint got no lover
Lookin' all I see is green, wonder can you buy me these?

[Pre-Chorus: H.E.R. & YBN Cordae]
It's hard to trust the things that we lust
No fallin in love, we so out of touch
When no one's around, who's holdin' you down?
It seems like the only thing you know is

[Verse 3: YBN Cordae]
Uh, uh
Now you know a young nigga got them racks up on me
I can introduce you to my rapper homies
But I ain't gon' take you to the matrimony
Probably gon' leave you down, sad and lonely
My infatuation with these bags I'm facin'
Got a couple dollars so congratulations
Tryna find love, so I'm navigatin'
Shower you with gifts, oversaturation
But I can't seem to find love without the ratchet shit
This gold dream of mine, why am I attached to this?
But happiness is when you glad in bliss
And the cash and shit is a catalyst
To cover up the pain, that's hazardous
The trouble, lust, and fame is attackin' quick
Oh my God

I don't even feel at home
But I keep my feelings low-key
Lockin' me out with no key
I just wanna go, you want me to leave
I don't even feel no love
Only in-between the sheets
Only time you notice me
When I make you feel right
You don't see what I see

[Pre-Chorus]
(Yeah) Kissin' me goodnight
Wakin' up to the sunlight
But you only want me over late
Tall glass of lemonade

[Chorus]
You don't ever say forever
Layin' next to me
But nights like this I wish I never
Said that I was free
You don't ever say forever
Layin' next to me
But nights like this I wish I never
Said that I was free, free, free, free

[Verse 2]
I'm always gon' answer your calls
Talkin' 'bout, "Come and see me"
I know we ain't even that deep
I'm still comin' anyway, maybe it'll change
I only worry 'bout you
Worry 'bout whatever you need
Always give it to you for free
And I know it ain't right
You don't see what I see

[Pre-Chorus]
(Yeah) Kissin' me goodnight (goodnight)
Wakin' up to the sunlight (sunlight)

You know what you're doing when you're giving me a rush

Feeling too high, I
And I'm face down, laid out, taking too much
Know I been a little too blunt
When I tell you what's mine (that's mine)
Got you on cloud nine

Now you dreamin' bout me while you sleeping
When you wake up I'm the reason
Eager for me like the weekend
Whatchu want, whatchu been needing?

All in your feelings so I need to get back

But it wouldn't be right
I ain't mean to lead you on
You know, we both
Want the real thing, no demo
The same for life, life

If I'm giving you the cold shoulder, that's closure
Needed someone to hold
But we both had our own motives, never told him that mine was to stay alone
And you don't belong to me
So you don't have to let me go
Doesn't always have to be something more
I'll be on my way (I'll be on my way)
I'll be on my way (I'll be on my way)

I feel it 'til it's gone
I don't care if you want this, bein' honest
I don't know what I want
And you don't belong to me[Verse 1: H.E.R.]
Set the tone, when it's just me
And you alone, never lonely

All alone, I'll let you hold me

(It's not of your, it's not of your)
"I'm having your baby (Hey, ah), it's none of your business" (Oh)
"I'm having your baby (Hey, hey), it's none of your, it's none of your" (Ow!)

[Verse 2]
It's New York, baby, always jacked up (Hey)
Holland Tunnel for a nose, it's always backed up [Sniffing]
When she's alone, she goes home to a cactus (Uh)
In a black dress, she's such an actress [Sniffing]

[Chorus]
Driving me crazy, but I'm into it, but I'm into it
I'm kinda into it
It's getting crazy, I think I'm losing it, I think I'm losing it
Oh, I think she said "I'm having your baby, it's none of your business"
"I'm having your baby, it's none of your business" (it's none of your, it's none of your)
"I'm having your baby, it's none of your business"
"I'm having your baby, it's none of your, it's none of your"

[Bridge]
She sits beside me like a silhouette
Hard candy dripping on me 'til my feet are wet
And now she's all over me, it's like I paid for it (cha-ching!)
It's like I paid for it, I'm gonna pay for this

[Chorus]
It's none of your, it's none of your
"I'm having your baby, it's none of your business"
"I'm having your baby, it's none of your business" (it's none of your, none of your)
"I'm having your baby, it's none of your business"
"I'm having your baby, it's none of your business" (it's none of your, none of your)[Verse 1]
Put a price on emotion
I'm looking for something to buy
You've got my devotion
But man, Icanhate you sometimes
Idon't want to fight you
And Idon't want to sleep in the dirt
We'll get the drinks in
So I'll get to thinking of her

[Chorus]
We'll be a fine line
We'll be a fine line
We'll be a fine line
We'll be a fine line
We'll be a fine line
We'll be a fine line

[Verse 2]
Test of my patience
There's things that we'll never know
You sunshine, you temptress
My hand's at risk, I fold
Crisp trepidation
I'll try to shake this soon
Spreading you open
Is the only way of knowing you

[Chorus]
We'll be a fine line
We'll be a fine line
We'll be a fine line
We'll be a fine line
We'll be a fine line
We'll be a fine line
We'll be a fine line
We'll be a fine line
We'll be a fine line
We'll be a fine line
We'll be a fine line
We'll be a fine line
We'll be alright
We'll be alright
We'll be a fine line
We'll be a fine line
We'll be alright (Alright, alright, alright)

[Outro]
(We'll be alright)
(We'll be alright)
We'll be alright
We'll be alright
Oh[Verse 1]
Same lips red, same eyes blue
Same white shirt, couple more tattoos
But it's not you and it's not me
Tastes so sweet, looks so real
Sounds like something that I used to feel
But I can't touch what I see

[Chorus]
We're not who we used to be
We're not who we used to be
We're just two ghosts standing in the place of you and me
Trying to remember how it feels to have a heartbeat

[Verse 2]
The fridge light washes this room white
Moon dances over your good side
And this was all we used to need
Tongue-tied like we've never known
Telling those stories we already told
'Cause we don't say what we really mean

[Chorus]
We're not who we used to be
We're not who we used to be
We're just two ghosts standing in the place of you and me
We're not who we used to be
We're not who we used to be
We're just two ghosts swimming in a glass half empty
Trying to remember how it feels to have a heartbeat

[Chorus]
We're not who we used to be
We're not who we used to be
We're just two ghosts standing in the place of you and me
We're not who we used to be
We don't see what we used to see
We're just two ghosts swimming in a glass half empty
Trying to remember how it feels to have a heartbeat

[Outro]
Trying to remember how it feels to have a heartbeat
I'm just trying to remember how it feels to have a heartbeat[Verse 1]
Sweet creature
Had another talk about where it's going wrong
But we're still young
We don't know where we're going
But we know where we belong

[Pre-Chorus]
And, oh, we started
Two hearts in one home
It's hard when we argue
We're both stubborn
I know, but oh

[Chorus]
Sweet creature, sweet creature
Wherever I go, you bring me home
Sweet creature, sweet creature
When I run out of road, you bring me home

[Verse 2]
Sweet creature
Running through the garden
Oh, where nothing bothered us
But we're still young
I always think about you and how we don't speak enough

Two hearts in one home
I know it's hard, we argue
We're both stubborn
I know, but oh

[Chorus]
Sweet creature, sweet creature
Wherever I go, you bring me home
Sweet creature, sweet creature
When I run out of road, you bring me home

[Pre-Chorus]
And, oh, when we started
Just two hearts in one home
It gets harder when we argue
We're both stubborn
I know, but oh

[Chorus]
Sweet creature, sweet creature
Wherever I go, you bring me home
Sweet creature, sweet creature
When I run out of road, you bring me home
You'll bring me home[Intro]

Dont blame the drunk caller

Woke up alone in this hotel room
Played with myself, where were you?
Fell back to sleep, I got drunk by noon
I've never felt less cool

[Chorus]
We haven't spoke since you went away
Comfortable silence is so overrated
Why won't you ever be the first one to break?
Even my phone misses your call, by the way

[Verse 2]
I saw your friend that you know from work
He said you feel just fine
I see you gave him my old t-shirt
More of what was once mine

[Chorus]
I see it's written, it's all over his face
Comfortable silence is so overrated
Why won't you ever say what you want to say?
Even my phone misses your call, by the way

[Bridge]
Maybe one day you'll call me and tell me that you're sorry too
Maybe one day you'll call me and tell me that you're sorry too
Maybe one day you'll call me and tell me that you're sorry too
But you, you never do
Woke up the girl who looked just like you
I almost said your name

[Chorus]
We haven't spoke since you went away
Comfortable silence is so overrated
Why won't you ever say what you want to say?
Even my phone misses your call
We haven't spoke since you went away
Comfortable silence is so overrated
Why won't you ever say what you want to say?
Even my phone misses your call, by the way[Verse 1]
Tell me something, tell me something
You dont know nothing, just pretend you do
I need something, tell me something new
Choose your words, 'cause there's no antidote
For this curse, oh, what's it waiting for?
Must this hurt you just before you go?

[Chorus]
Oh, tell me something I don't already know
Oh, tell me something I don't already know

[Verse 2]
Brooklyn saw me, empty at the news
There's no water inside this swimming pool
Almost over, had enough from you
I've been praying, I never did before
Understand I'm talking to the walls
I've been praying ever since New York

[Chorus]
Oh, tell me something I don't already know
Oh, tell me something I don't already know
Oh, tell me something I don't already know
Oh, tell me something I don't already know

Should we just search romantic comedies on Netflix and then see what we find?

[Verse 1]
I'm selfish, I know
But I don't ever want to see you with him
I'm selfish, I know
I told you, but I know you never listen

[Pre-Chorus]
I hope you can see, the shape that I'm in
While he's touching your skin

Tempted, you know
Apologies are never gonna fix this (Hmm-mm)
I'm empty, I know
And promises are broken like a stitch is

While he's touching your skin
This thing upon me, howls like a beast
You flower, you feast

Wo-woman (Hmm-mm), woman (Hmm-mm)

Woman[Intro]
I saw this angel
I really saw an angel

[Verse 1]
Open up your eyes, shut your mouth and see
That I'm still the only one who's been in love with me
I'm just happy getting you stuck in between my teeth
And there's nothing I can do about it
Broke a finger knocking on your bedroom door
I got splinters in my knuckles crawling across the floor
Couldn't take you home to mother in a skirt that short
But I think that's what I like about it

[Chorus]
She's an angel
Only angel
She's an angel
My only angel

[Verse 2]
I must admit I thought I'd like to make you mine
As I went about my business through the warning signs
End up meeting in the hallway every single time
And there's nothing we can do about it
Told it to her brother and she told it to me
That she's gonna be an angel, just you wait and see
When it turns out she's a devil in between the sheets
And there's nothing she can do about it
Hey, hey

[Chorus]
She's an angel
Only angel
She's an angel
My only angel
She's an angel
Only angel
She's an angel
My only angel

[Verse 1]
She's got a family in Carolina (Woo, oh yeah)
So far away, but she says I remind her of home (Woo, oh yeah)
Feeling oh so far from home (Woo, oh yeah)
She never saw herself as a West Coaster (Woo, oh yeah)
Moved all the way 'cause her grandma told her: (Woo, oh yeah)
"Townes, better swim before you drown" (Woo, oh yeah)

[Chorus]
She's a good girl (La la la la la la la la la la)
She's such a good girl (La la la la la la la la la la)
She's a good girl (La la la la la la la la la la)
She feels so good (Woo, oh yeah)

[Verse 2]
She's got a book for every situation (Situation)
Gets into parties without invitations (Invitations)
How could you ever turn her down? (Down, down, down, down)
There's not a drink that I think could sink her (Sink her)
How would I tell her that she's all I think about? (Think about)
Well, I guess she just found out

[Chorus]
She's a good girl (La la la la la la la la la la)
She's such a good girl (La la la la la la la la la la)
She's a good girl (La la la la la la la la la la)
She feels so good (Woo, oh yeah)

I wanna scream, yeah
I wanna shout it out (Woo, oh yeah)
And I hope she hears me now (Woo, oh yeah)

Feels so good
She feels so good (La la la la la la la la la la)

Oh, she's a good girl
She feels so good (Woo, oh yeah, woo, oh yeah)[Intro]
Two, three, four

[Verse 1]
Meet me in the hallway, meet me in the hallway
I just left your bedroom, give me some morphine
Is there any more to do?

[Chorus]
Just let me know, I'll be at the door, at the door
Hoping you'll come around
Just let me know I'll be on the floor, on the floor
Maybe we'll work it out
I gotta get better, gotta get better
I gotta get better, gotta get better
I gotta get better, gotta get better
And maybe we'll work it out

I walked the streets all day, running with the thieves
'Cause you left me in the hallway (Give me some more)
Just take the pain away

Hoping you'll come around
Just let me know, I'll be on the floor, on the floor

I gotta get better, gotta get better
And maybe we'll work it out

[Outro]
We don't talk about it, it's something we don't do
'Cause once you go without it, nothing else will do[Verse 1]
Gotta see it to believe it, sky never looked so blue
So hard to leave it,that'swhat I alwaysdo
So I keep thinking back toa time under the canyon moon

[Verse 2]
The world's happy waitin', door's yellow, broken blue
I heard Jenny saying, "Go get the kids from school"
And I keep thinking back to the time under the canyon moon

[Refrain]
I'll be gone too long from you

[Verse 3]
Staring at the ceiling, two weeks and I'll be home
Carry the feeling, through Paris, all through Rome
And I'm still thinking back to the time under the canyon moon

[Chorus]
I'm going, oh, I'm going
I'm going, oh, I'm going
I'm going, oh, I'm going home
I'm going, oh, I'm going
I'm going, oh, I'm going
I'm going, oh, I'm going home

[Verse 4]
Quick pause in conversation, she plays songs I've never heard
An old lover's hippie music, pretends not to know the words
And I keep thinking back to the time under the canyon moon

[Refrain]
I'll be gone too long from you

[Chorus]
I'm going, oh, I'm going
I'm going, oh, I'm going
I'm going, oh, I'm going home
I'm going, oh, I'm going (I'm going home)

Want everything she has
That smile and that midnight laugh

Ya-ya-ee, ya-ya-ee, ya-ya-ee, ya-ya-ee
Blame it on my juice, blame it, blame it on my juice

[Verse 2]
No, I'm not a snack at all
Look, baby, I'm the whole damn meal (Ooh, baby)
Geoffrey, you ain't bein' slick
Don't dare try to cop a feel (Ooh, baby)
The juice ain't worth the squeeze
If the juice don't look like this (Like this, like this, like this)
Hold up, baby, please
Don't make me have to take your ooo! (How I roll)

[Pre-Chorus]
If I'm shinin', everybody gonna shine (Yeah, I'm goals)
I was born like this, don't even gotta try (Now you know)
I'm like chardonnay (Okay), get better over time (So you know)
Heard you say I'm not the baddest, bitch, you lie (You lie)

[Chorus]
It ain't my fault that I'm out here gettin' loose
Gotta blame it on the Goose
Gotta blame it on my juice, baby
It ain't my fault that I'm out here makin' news
I'm the pudding in the proof
Gotta blame it on my juice

[Post-Chorus]
Ya-ya-ee, ya-ya-ee, ya-ya-ee, ya-ya-ee
Blame it on my juice, blame it, blame it on my juice
Ya-ya-ee, ya-ya-ee, ya-ya-ee, ya-ya-ee
Blame it on my juice, blame it, blame it on my juice (Alright)
Ya-ya-ee

[Bridge]
Somebody come get your man
I think he got lost in my DMs, what? My DMs, what?
You better come get your man
I think he wanna be way more than friends, what?
Way more than friends
What you want me to say?

[Chorus]
It ain't my fault that I'm out here gettin' loose
Gotta blame it on the Goose
Gotta blame it on my juice, baby
It ain't my fault that I'm out here makin' news
I'm the pudding in the proof
Gotta blame it on my juice

[Post-Chorus]
Ya-ya-ee, ya-ya-ee, ya-ya-ee, ya-ya-ee
Blame it on my juice, blame it, blame it on my juice
Ya-ya-ee, ya-ya-ee, ya-ya-ee, ya-ya-ee
Blame it on my juice, blame it, blame it on my juice[Verse 1]
The lights down where youre under
Theyve got a different kind of taste
And Id still cry Id still wonder
Would you recognize my face?

[Chorus]
You started to lose the features
The ones I loved the most
The sweetest kind of lover
Baby honey whered you go

[Verse 2]
Went down to California
Burned my skin inside and out
Trying to imagine the right form of
Cutting loose, the one youd talked about

[Chorus]
I couldve seen the way you got
When I started to get close
The most painful type of lover
Baby honey whered you go

[Outro]
Baby honey, was it me?
Baby honey, not sick not sweet
Baby honey, let me know
Baby honey, left me aloneNow you were standing there right in front of me
I hold on it's getting harder to breathe
All of a sudden these lights are blinding me
I never noticed how bright they would be

I saw in the corner there is a photograph
No doubt in my mind it's a picture of you
It lies there alone in it's bed of broken glass
This bed was never made for two

I'll keep my eyes wide open
I'll keep my arms wide open

Don't let me
Don't let me
Don't let me go
Cause I'm tired of feeling alone

Don't let me
Don't let me go
Cause I'm tired of feeling alone

I promised one day that I'd bring you back a star
I caught one and it burned a hole in my hand, oh
Seems like these days I watch you from afar
Just trying to make you understand
I'll keep my eyes wide open, yeah

Don't let me
Don't let me
Don't let me go
Cause I'm tired of feeling alone

Don't let me
Don't let me go

Don't let me
Don't let me
Don't let me go
Cause I'm tired of feeling alone

Don't let me
Don't let me
Don't let me go
Cause I'm tired of feeling alone

Don't let me
Don't let me go
Cause I'm tired of sleeping alone[Chorus]
We're on that ultralight beam, that ultralight beam
This is everything
We're on that ultralight beam, ultralight beam
This is everything, it's every...thing

[Refrain]
I'm tryna keep my faith
But I'm looking for more
It's holy war, it's holy war
Tryna keep my faith
But I'm looking for more

[Chorus]
We're on that ultralight beam, ultralight beam, baby

[Verse]
Foot on the devil and Im moving my family to Zambia
My daughter looks just like Sia, you can't see her

And Now we're on that ultralight beam, ultralight beam baby

And now we're on that ultralight beam, ultralight beam baby
It's everything[Verse 1]
Listen to the wind blow, watch the sun rise
Running in the shadows, damn your love, damn your lies

[Chorus]
And if you don't love me now
You will never love me again
I can still hear you saying you would never break the chain
(Never break the chain)
If you don't love me now
(If you don't love me now)
You will never love me again
(Never love me again)
I can still hear you saying you would never break the chain

Running in the shadows, damn your love, damn your lies
Break the silence, damn the dark, damn the light

And if you don't love me now
You will never love me again
I can still hear you saying you would never break the chain
(Never break the chain)
And if you don't love me now
(If you don't love me now)
You will never love me again
(Never love me again)
I can still hear you saying you would never break the chain
(Hear you saying, never break the chain)
If you don't love me now
(If you don't love me now)
You will never love me again
(Never love me again)
I can still hear you saying you would never break the chain
(Hear you saying, never break the chain)

[Instrumental]

[Outro]
Chains keep us together
Chains keep us together
Chains keep us together (running in the shadows)
Chains keep us together (running in the shadows)
Chains keep us together
Chains keep us together[Verse 1: Kacey Musgraves]
Yeah, looks like we've made it
Look how far we've come, my baby
We mighta took the long way
We knew we'd get there some day

[Pre-Chorus: Kacey Musgraves]
They say, "I bet they'll never make it."
But just look at us holding on
Were still together, still going strong, oh

[Chorus: Harry Styles & Kacey Musgraves]
Still the one I run to
The one that I belong to
Still the one I want for life
Still the one that I love
The only one I dream of
Still the one I kiss good night

[Verse 2: Harry Styles]
Ain't nothing better
We beat the odds together
Glad we didn't listen
Look at what we would be missing

[Pre-Chorus: Harry Styles & Kacey Musgraves & Both]
They said (They said)
"I'll bet (I'll bet), they'll never make it"
But just look at us holding on
We're still together, still going strong, oh

[Chorus: Harry Styles & Kacey Musgraves]
Still the one I run to
The one that I belong to
Still the one I want for life
Still the one that I love
The only one I dream of
Still the one I kiss good night
Still the one I run to
The one that I belong to
Still the one I want for life
Still the one that I love
The only one I dream of
Still the one I kiss good night

[Outro: Harry Styles & Both]
So glad we made it
Look how far we've come, my baby

Solo para tu llanto, es la seal de los tiempos
Bienvenido al ltimo show
Espero que lleves puesta tu mejor ropa
No puedes sobornar la entrada en tu camino al cielo
Te ves tan bonita aqu abajo
Pero no eres realmente buena

[Pre-Chorus]
Nunca aprendemos, ya hemos estado aqu antes
Porque siempre estamos atascados y huyendo
De las balas? de las balas?
Nunca aprendemos, ya hemos estado aqu antes
Porque siempre estamos atascados y huyendo
De las balas? de las balas?

No hablamos lo suficiente, deberamos abrirnos ms
Antes de que sea demasiado
Nunca aprendemos? Ya hemos estado aqu antes
Es todo lo que sabemos

Solo para tu llanto, es la seal de los tiempos
Tenemos que escapar, tenemos que escapar
Tenemos que escapar, tenemos que escapar
Tenemos que escapar
Tenemos que, tenemos que escapar
Tenemos que, tenemos que escapar
Tenemos que, tenemos que escapar[Verse 1]
I don't know if you can take it
I know you want to see me naked
I just want to be your baby
But I can't be around you

[Chorus]
When I'm with you all I get is wild thoughts

Youre the guy i wish i could be
The stories, the drawing, allofyour books
Ill takeit all over my good looks
Thepressure
To be the coolest in class
Its not worth it and i know it wont last

And yes ive had sex and it feels great
The girls body, the butt, the shape, its amazing
I ride like no other
Except for when you're hanging with your brother

But back to sex, such a good feeling
Call me pig boy cause you know i be squealin

Back to you number one big bro
I love you scotty, just had to let you know[Verse 1]
I don't ever ask you where you've been
'Cause I don't feel the need to
Know who you're with
I can't even think straight
But I can tell
You were just with her
And I'll still be a fool, 'cause I'm a fool for you

[Chorus]
Just a little bit of your heart
Just a little bit of your heart
Just a little bit of your heart is all I want
Just a little bit of your heart
Just a little bit of your heart
Just a little bit is all I'm asking for

[Verse 2]
I don't ever tell you how I really feel
'Cause I can't find the words to say what I mean
And nothing's ever easy
That's what they say
I know I'm not your only
I'll still be a fool
'Cause I'm a fool for you

[Chorus]
Just a little bit of your heart
Just a little bit of your heart
Just a little bit of your heart is all I want
Just a little bit of your heart
Just a little bit of your heart
Just a little bit is all I'm asking for

[Bridge]
I know I'm not your only
But at least I'm one
I heard a little love is better than none

[Chorus]
Just a little bit of your heart
Just a little bit of your heart
Just a little bit of your heart is all I want
Just a little bit of your heart
Just a little bit of your heart
Just a little bit is all I'm asking for
Just a little bit of your heart
Just a little bit of your heart
Just a little bit of your heart is all I want
Just a little bit of your heart
Just a little bit of your heart
Just a little bit is all I'm asking for

        [Verse 1]
I met you in the dark
You lit me up
You made me feel as though
I was enough
We danced the night away
We drank too much
I held your hair back when
You were throwing up

[Pre-Chorus]
Then you smiled over your shoulder
For a minute, I was stone cold sober
I pulled you closer to my chest
And you asked me to stay over
I said, I already told ya
I think that you should get some rest

[Chorus 1]
I knew I loved you then
But you'd never know
'Cause I played it cool
When I was scared of letting go
I knew I needed you
But I never showed

But I wanna stay with you
Until we're grey and old
Just say you won't let go
Just say you won't let go

[Verse 2]
I'll wake you up with some breakfast in bed
I'll bring you coffee
With a kiss on your head
And I'll take the kids to school
Wave them goodbye
And I'll thank my lucky stars for that night

[Pre-Chorus 2]
When you looked over your shoulder
For a minute, I forget that I'm older
I wanna dance with you right now, oh
And you look as beautiful as ever
And I swear that everyday you'll get better
You make me feel this way somehow

[Chorus 2]
I'm so in love with you
And I hope you know
Darling your love is more
Than worth its weight in gold
We've come so far my dear
Look how we've grown
And I wanna stay with you
Until we're grey and old
Just say you won't let go
Just say you won't let go

[Bridge]
I wanna live with you
Even when we're ghosts
'Cause you were always there for me
When I needed you most

[Chorus 3]
I'm gonna love you till
My lungs give out
I promise 'til death we part
Like in our vows
So I wrote this song for you
Now everybody knows
That it's just you and me
Until we're grey and old
Just say you won't let go
Just say you won't let go

[Outro]
Just say you won't let go
Oh, just say you won't let go[Verse 1]
Hey, you there
Can we take it to the next level, baby, do you dare?
Don't be scared
'Cause if you can say the words, I don't know why I should care

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause here I am, I'm givin' all I can
But all you ever do is mess it up
Yeah, I'm right here, I'm tryin' to make it clear
That getting half of you just ain't enough

[Chorus]
I'm not gonna wait until you're done
Pretending you don't need anyone
I'm standing here naked (Naked, naked)
I'm standing here naked (Naked, naked)
I'm not gonna try 'til you decide
You're ready to swallow all your pride
I'm standing here naked (Naked, naked)
I'm standing here naked (Naked, naked)

[Verse 2]
Hey, get out
I've got nothin' left to give and you give me nothin' now
Read my mouth
If you ever want me back, then your walls need breakin' down

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause here I am, I'm givin' all I can
But all you ever do is mess it up (All you ever do)
Yeah, I'm right here, I'm tryin' to make it clear
Getting half of you just ain't enough

[Chorus]
I'm not gonna wait until you're done
Pretending you don't need anyone
I'm standing here naked (Naked, naked)
I'm standing here naked (Naked, naked)
I'm not gonna try 'til you decide
You're ready to swallow all your pride
I'm standing here naked (Naked, naked)
I'm standing here naked (Naked, naked)

[Bridge]
Oh, I wanna give you everything
Wanna give you everything
Oh, I, I wanna give you everything
I wanna give you everything, oh

[Chorus]
I'm not gonna wait until you're gone
'Cause you pretend that you don't need anyone
Can't you see that I'm naked (Naked, naked)
Oh, see that I'm naked (Naked, naked)
I'm not gonna try 'til you decide
You're ready to swallow all your pride (Swallow your pride)
I'm standing here naked (I'm standing here naked, naked, naked)
I'm standing here naked (I'm standing, I'm standing here)

[Outro]
I'm standing
I'm standing here[Verse 1]
You walked into the room
And now my heart's been stolen
You took me back in time to when I was unbroken
Now you're all I want
And I knew it from the very first moment
Cause a light came on when I heard that song
And I want you to sing it again

[Chorus]
I swear that every word you sing
You wrote them for me
Like it was a private show
But I know you never saw me
When the lights come on and I'm on my own
Will you be there to sing it again
Could I be the one you talk about in all your stories
Can I be him

[Verse 2]
I heard there was someone but I know he don't deserve you
If you were mine I'd never let anyone hurt you
I wanna dry those tears, kiss those lips
It's all that I've been thinking about
Cause a light came on when I heard that song
And I want you to sing it again

[Chorus]
I swear that every word you sing
You wrote them for me
Like it was a private show
But I know you never saw me
When the lights come on and I'm on my own
Will you be there to sing it again
Could I be the one you talk about in all your stories

[Bridge]
Can I be the one
Can I be the one
Can I be the one
Oh, can I, can I be him

Won't you sing it again
Oh, when you sing it again
Can I be him
Won't you sing it again
Oh, when you sing it again
Can I be him

[Chorus]
I swear that every word you sang
You wrote them for me
Like it was a private show
But I know you never saw me
When the lights come on and I'm on my own
Will you be there, will you be there
Can I be the one you talk about in all your stories
Can I be him
Can I be him
Can I be him
Can I be him[Intro]
Mmm-hmm, mm

[Verse 1]
I remember years ago
Someone told me I should take
Caution when it comes to love, I did
And you were strong and I was not
My illusion, my mistake
I was careless, I forgot, I did

[Pre-Chorus]
And now when all is done
There is nothing to say
You have gone and so effortlessly
You have won, you can go ahead tell them

[Chorus]
Tell them all I know now
Shout it from the rooftops
Write it on the skyline
All we had is gone now
Tell them I was happy
And my heart is broken
All my scars are open
Tell them what I hoped would be
Impossible, impossible
Impossible, impossible

[Verse 2]
Falling out of love is hard
Falling for betrayal is worse
Broken trust and broken hearts
I know, I know
Thinking all you need is there
Building faith on love and words
Empty promises will wear
I know, I know

[Pre-Chorus]
And now when all is done
There is nothing to say
And if you're done with embarrassing me
On your own you can go ahead tell them

[Chorus]
Tell them all I know now
Shout it from the rooftops
Write it on the skyline
All we had is gone now
Tell them I was happy
And my heart is broken
All my scars are open
Tell them what I hoped would be
Impossible, impossible
Impossible, impossible

[Bridge]
I remember years ago
Someone told me I should take
Caution when it comes to love, I did

[Outro]
Tell them all I know now
Shout it from the rooftops
Write it on the skyline
All we had is gone now
Tell them I was happy
And my heart is broken
Hoped would be
Impossible (impossible), impossible (impossible)
Impossible, impossible
Impossible (impossible), impossible (impossible)
Impossible, impossible[Verse 1]
I don't see you
You're not in every window I look through
And I don't miss you
You're not in every single thing I do
I don't think we're meant to be
And you are not the missing piece
I won't hear it
Whenever anybody says your name
And I won't feel it
Even when I'm burstin' into flames
I don't regret the day I left
I don't believe that I was blessed
I'm probably lyin' to myself, again

[Chorus]
I'm alone in my head
Looking for love in a stranger's bed
But I don't think I'll find it
'Cause only you could fill this empty space
I wanna tell all my friends
But I don't think they would understand
It's somethin' I've decided
'Cause only you could fill this empty space

[Post-Chorus]
Space, space
This empty space
Space, space
This
'Cause only you could fill this empty space

[Verse 2]
I've been drinking
I've been doin' things I shouldn't do
Overthinking
I don't know who I am without you
I'm a liar and a cheat
I let my ego swallow me
And that's why I might never see you again

[Chorus]
I'm alone in my head
Looking for love in a stranger's bed
But I don't think I'll find it
'Cause only you could fill this empty space
I wanna tell all my friends
But I don't think they would understand
It's somethin' I've decided
'Cause only you could fill this empty space

[Post-Chorus]
Space, space
This empty space
Space, space
This
'Cause only you could fill this empty space

[Outro]
How could I make you love me?
How could I make you love me?
How could I make you love me?
How could I make you love me?
How could I make you love me?
How could I make you love me?
How could I make you love me? (Space)
How could I make you love me? (Space)
How could I make you love me?
How could I make you love me? (Space)
How could I make you love me? (Space)
How could I make you love me?
How could I make you love me? (Space, yeah, yeah, yeah)
How could I make you love me? (Space, yeah, yeah, yeah)
How could I make you love me?[Verse 1]
I swear to God, when I come home
I'm gonna hold you so close
I swear to God, when I come home, I'll never let go
Like a river, I flow to the ocean I know
You pull me close, guiding me home

[Chorus]
And I need you to know that we're
Fallin' so fast, we're fallin' like the stars, fallin' in love
And I'm not scared to say those words
With you I'm safe, we're fallin' like the stars, we're fallin' in love

[Verse 2]
I swear to God, I can see
Four kids and no sleep
We'll have one on each knee, you and me, hmm
And when they've grown up
You're still the girl in the club
When I held your hair up, 'cause you had too much

[Chorus]
And I need you to know that we're
Fallin' so fast, we're fallin' like the stars, fallin' in love
And I'm not scared to say those words
With you I'm safe, we're fallin' like the stars, fallin' in love

[Verse 3]
I swear to God, every day
He won't take you away
'Cause without you, babe, I lose my way

[Bridge]
Oh, I'm in love (I'm in love)
Oh, I'm in love (I'm in love)
Oh, I'm in love (I'm in love)
Oh, I'm in love (I'm in love)
Oh, I'm in love (I'm in love)
Oh, I'm in love (Fallin' like the stars)

[Chorus]
And I need you to know that we're
Fallin' so fast, we're fallin' like the stars, fallin' in love
And I'm not scared to say those words
With you I'm safe, we're fallin' like the stars, we're fallin' in love[Verse 1]
I remember when you were all mine
Watched you changing in front of my eyes
What can I say
Now that I'm not the fire in the cold
Now that I'm not the hand that you hold
As you're walking away

[Chorus]
Will you call me to tell me you're alright
Cause I'll worry about you the whole night
Don't repeat my mistakes
I won't sleep 'til you're safe inside
If you're home I just hope that you're sober
Is it time to let go now you're older
Don't leave me this way
I won't sleep 'til you're safe inside

[Verse 2]
Everyone has to find their own way
And I'm sure things will work out okay
I wish that was the truth
All we know is the sun will rise
Thank your lucky stars that you're alive
It's a beautiful life

[Chorus]
Will you call me to tell me you're alright
Cause I'll worry about you the whole night
Don't repeat my mistakes
I won't sleep 'til you're safe inside
If you're home I just hope that you're sober
Is it time to let go now you're older
Don't leave me this way
I won't sleep 'til you're safe inside

[Bridge]
If you make the same mistakes
I will love you in either way
All I know is that I can't live without you
There is nothing I can say
That will change you in any way
Darling, I could never live without you
I can't live, I can't live

[Chorus]
Will you call me to tell me you're alright
Cause I'll worry about you the whole night
Don't make my mistakes
I won't sleep, I won't sleep
If you're home I just hope that you're sober
Is it time to let go now you're older
Don't leave me this way
I won't sleep 'til you're safe inside

[Outro]
Will you call me to tell me you're alright
Cause I worry about you[Intro]
Fighting, living, dying
For what? For freedom?
That for which men have fought since time began, tobefree

[Verse 1]
They've been makingblanket statements, scaring everyone
They've been makingyou feel like you never did belong
Yeah, he said, and she said, yeah, they say a lot
So many things, they just think you forgot
Who you are, and what you do, and where you're coming from
I just thought I could remind you with a simple song
No bad body language can start to rub off
Till we're choosing weapons and hatred, not love
Not you

[Chorus]
You were in the wilderness
Looking for your own purpose
Then you became a butterfly, a butterfly
I knew you always would
'Cause they were throwing sticks and stones
But words could never break your bones
You just spread your wings and fly, your wings and fly
I knew you always would
I knew you always were
I knew there always was nothing wrong with being
You, you, you, you, you, you, you, you

[Verse 2]
All you ever see on CNN are enemies
Telling you to lose your individuality
Look, do this and do that, till you've lost your way
Till you need a vice or a means of escape
They want you to stare into your screen and see yourself
Blow smoke into your mirror till you're mentally unwell
So don't let them catch you with lies and deceit
They can't take your soul or desire for freedom
You

[Chorus]
You were in the wilderness
Looking for your own purpose
Then you became a butterfly, a butterfly
I knew you always would
'Cause they were throwing sticks and stones
But words could never break your bones
You just spread your wings and fly, your wings and fly
I knew you always would
I knew you always were
I knew there always was nothing wrong with being

[Bridge]
Yeah, yeah
You said I wanna be, I'm gonna be
Everything they said that I couldn't be
Everything that I said I would be, when I picked up a pen and I started to speak
I hear the beat, my melody
I just poured all of my heart in these sheets
I could not just be a star in the street
Man, I knew I was different, I had the belief
Nowhere to live, nothing to eat
You were so hungry that you couldn't sleep
You couldn't breathe, how could it be
All of this shit was happening to me?
I would do drugs, I was a thief
Still on the run from the karma police
You were the mission that's given to me
By the powers that be minus Devil, G-O-D

[Post-Bridge]
You were in the wilderness, looking for your own purpose
And you became a butterfly, a butterfly
I knew you always would

[Chorus]
You were in the wilderness
Looking for your own purpose
And you became a butterfly, a butterfly
I knew you always were
'Cause they were throwing sticks and stones
But words will never break your bones
You just spread your wings and fly, your wings and fly
I knew you always would
I knew you always were
I knew you always would
I know there always was nothing wrong with being
You, you, you, you, you, you, you, you[Verse 1]
I'm just not sure my heart is working
And yours is beating double time
Deep down you know I ain't even worth it
It's not enough, babe, all I do is make you cry

[Pre-Chorus]
Like ooh-ahh, ooh-ahh
I know I do this every time
Like ooh-ahh, I know
That I just got to say what's on my mind

[Chorus]
You deserve better, better, better than me
Might be what you want, but I'm not what you need
You're better, better than you even realise
You deserve better, better, better than me
Might be what you want, but I want you to see
You're better off without me in your life

[Post-Chorus]
And I hope you'll find somebody else
That'll love you like nobody else
And I hope he gives you something real, oh, I love you still
But you deserve better, better, better, better

[Verse 2]
Give up on me, 'cause, babe, I'm hopeless
The more it hurts, the more you try
You know I loved, I just never showed it
It'll be too late when you're with some other guy

[Pre-Chorus]
Like ooh-ahh, ooh-ahh
I know I do this every time
Like ooh-ahh, I know
That I just got to say what's on my mind

[Chorus]
You deserve better, better, better than me
Might be what you want, but I'm not what you need
You're better, better than you even realise
You deserve better, better, better than me
Might be what you want, but I want you to see
You're better off without me in your life

[Post-Chorus]
And I hope you'll find somebody else
That'll love you like nobody else
And I hope he gives you something real, oh, I love you still
But you deserve better, better, better, better

[Bridge]
Might be what you want, but not what you need
Baby, oh yeah

[Chorus]
You deserve better, better, better than me
Might be what you want, but I'm not what you need
You're better, better than you even realise
You deserve better, better, better than me
Might be what you want, but I want you to see
You're better off without me in your life

[Post-Chorus]
And I hope you'll find somebody else
That'll love you like nobody else
And I hope he gives you something real, oh, I love you still
But you deserve better, better, better, better[Verse 1]
Laying in the silence
Waiting for the sirens
Signs, any signs I'm alive still
I don't wanna lose it
But I'm not getting through this
Hey, should I pray
Should I pray, yeah, to myself
To a God? To a saviour who can

[Chorus]
Unbreak the broken
Unsay these spoken words
Find hope in the hopeless
Pull me out the train wreck
Unburn the ashes
Unchain the reactions now
I'm not ready to die not yet
Pull me out the train wreck
Pull me out, pull me out
Pull me out, pull me out
Pull me out

[Verse 2]
Underneath our bad blood
We've still got a sanctum
Home, still a home, still a home here
It's not too late to build it back
'Cause a one in a million chance
Is still a chance, still a chance
And I would take those odds

[Chorus]
Unbreak the broken
Unsay these spoken words
Find hope in the hopeless
Pull me out the train wreck
Unburn the ashes
Unchain the reactions
I'm not ready to die, not yet
Pull me out the train wreck
Pull me out, pull me out
Pull me out, pull me out
Pull me out, pull me out

[Bridge]
You can say what you like
Just don't say I wouldn't die for it
I'm down on my knees
And I need you to be my God
Be my help, be a saviour
Who can

[Chorus]
Unbreak the broken
Unsay these reckless words
Find hope in the hopeless
Pull me out the train wreck
Unburn the ashes
Unchain the reactions
I'm not ready to die, not yet
Pull me out the train wreck
Pull me out, pull me out
Pull me out, pull me out
Pull me out, pull me out[Verse 1]
I'm in the kitchen while you smoke outside
You're careful not to let the smoke inside
Ialwaystell you it'spoison
But I know it helps youtake the edge off the day
We get a drink before it's closing time
The one on High Street with the blinking sign
All of these memories feel poignant
I won't be there to see the snow melt away

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh-oh-oh
Yeah, I been gone on business
I gotta make some money
I really feel the distance

[Chorus]
And I quite miss home
And I miss you telling me to leave my shoes at the door
'Cause you just swept the floor and the dirt drives you crazy
Yeah, I quite miss home
'Cause it feels like poetry
When the rain falls down on the window
While you're in my arms and we're watching the TV
Yeah, I quite miss home
Yeah, I quite miss home

[Verse 2]
I smell you cooking from the living room
And then I tell you that I love your food
I know it doesn't come easy
But you know it reminds me where I'm from

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh-oh-oh
I'm in another city
I got nobody with me
And it just really hit me

[Chorus]
That I quite miss home
And I miss you telling me to leave my shoes at the door
'Cause you just swept the floor and the dirt drives you crazy
Yeah, I quite miss home
'Cause it feels like poetry
And the rain falls down on the window
While you're in my arms and we're watching the TV
Yeah, I quite miss home
Yeah, I quite miss home

[Outro]
And I quite miss home
Yeah, I miss you telling me to leave my shoes at the door
'Cause you just swept the floor and the dirt drives you crazy
Oh, I just miss home
'Cause it feels like poetry
As the rain falls down on the window
While you're in my arms and we're watching the TV
Oh, I miss home
Yeah, I quite miss home
Oh, I quite miss home
Yeah
Yeah, I quite miss home[Chorus]
Back from the edge
Back from the dead
Back before demons took control of my head
Back to the start
Back to my heart
Back to the boy who would reach for the stars
Oh, he would reach for the stars, yeah

[Verse 1]
You can take my home, you can take my clothes
You can take the drugs I have that nobody knows
You can take my watch, you can take my phone
You can take all I've got 'til I'm skin and bone
I don't want control, I can dig my own hole
I can make my bed and I can lie in it cold

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause I don't need heat, I've been burnin' in hell
But now I'm back with my own story to tell

[Chorus]
Back from the edge
Back from the dead
Back before demons took control of my head
Back to the start
Back to my heart
Back to the boy who would reach for the stars
Oh, back from the edge
Back from the dead
Back from the tears that were too easily shed
Back to the start
Back to my heart
Back to the boy who would reach for the stars
Who would reach for the stars, yeah

[Verse 2]
They don't like my lines, they don't like my songs
Except in karaoke when they're singing along
Did you see them build me up? Watch me tear myself down
With a smile on my face, I dug my grave in the ground
We all make mistakes, we're so quick to judge
It's hard to forgive when we hold onto a grudge

[Pre-Chorus]
So turn down the heat, I've been burnin' in hell
But now I'm back with my own story to tell

[Chorus]
Back from the edge
Back from the dead
Back before demons took control of my head
Back to the start
Back to my heart
Back to the boy who would reach for the stars
Oh, back from the edge
Back from the dead
Back from the tears that were too easily shed
Back to the start
Back to my heart
Back to the boy who would reach for the stars
Who would reach for the stars, yeah

[Bridge]
I don't want control, I can dig my own hole
I can make my bed and I can lie in it cold
'Cause I don't need heat, I've been burnin' in hell
But now I'm back with my own story to tell

[Chorus]
Back from the edge
Back from the dead
Back before demons took control of my head
Back to the start
Back to my heart
Back to the boy who would reach for the stars
Oh, back from the edge
Back from the dead
Back from the tears that were too easily shed
Back to the start
Back to my heart
Back to the boy who would reach for the stars
Who would reach for the stars, yeah[Verse 1]
So you told me to go
You said dont turn around
There was no going back
Yeah, you said it
You were all out of love
Now you changing your mind
I forgive you but I, cant forget it

[Pre-Chorus]
We walked these roads too many times
I know the ropes and all your lines
If its over

[Chorus]
Stop asking me to come back
Oh, stop asking me to do that
Its like youre waiting on a better man
And you break me all over again
Stop asking me to come back

[Verse 2]
I dont wanna be friends
'Cause Ill always want more
Let the end be the end
But go on just say it

[Chorus]
Stop asking me to come back

Its like you're waiting on a better man
And you break me all over again
Stop asking me to come back

[Bridge]

[Pre-Chorus]
We walked these roads too many times
I know your ropes and all your lines
If its over

[Chorus]
Stop asking me to come back
Oh, stop asking me to do that
Its like you're waiting on a better man
And you break me all over again
Stop asking me to come back[Verse 1: James Arthur]
Something about you
It's like an addiction
Hit me with your best shot honey

I've got no reason to doubt you
Cause certain things hurt
And you're my only virtue
And I'm virtually yours

[Pre-Chorus: Chasing Grace]
And you keep coming back, coming back again
Keep running round, running round, running round my head

[Chorus: James Arthur]
And there's certain things that I adore
And there's certain things that I ignore
But I'm certain that I'm yours
Certain that I'm yours
Certain that I'm yours

[Verse 2: James Arthur]
There's something about you
It's when you get angry
You have me at your mercy

And you're like a shoulder to turn to
Cause certain things burn
Just when we're hanging on for dear life
We held on so tight

[Pre-Chorus: Chasing Grace]
And you keep coming back, coming back again
Keep running round, running round, running round my head

[Chorus: James Arthur]
And there's certain things that I adore
And there's certain things that I ignore
But I'm certain that I'm yours
Certain that I'm yours
Certain that I'm yours

[Outro: James Arthur and Chasing Grace]
There's certain things that I adore
And there's certain things that I ignore
But I'm certain that I'm yours
Certain that I'm yours
I adore you
Certain that I'm yours
I adore you... I adore you...
I adore you... I adore you...
Certain that I'm yours
I adore you... I adore you...
Let's ignore them... Let's ignore them
Let's ignore them... Let's ignore them
Certain that I'm yours[Verse 1]
It's a long night in a big crowd
Under these lights lookin' 'round for you, uh
Yeah, I'm steppin' outside under moonlight
To get my head right, lookin' out for you, uh

[Refrain]
Could it be your eyes? Didn't know that I've been
Waitin', waitin' for you
When you're by my side, everything's alright
Crazy, I'm crazy for you

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, here I go, down that road
Again and again, the fool rushin' in
But I can't help when I feel some kind of way
Do you feel the same?

[Chorus]
'Cause
I'll fall, I'll fall for you
You caught me at my weakest
And I'll fall for you

[Verse 2]
Yeah, it's a long night in a big crowd
Under these lights lookin' 'round for you, mmm
Oh, you give me hope, right reason, desire livin' this life
Only now for you, oh, for you

[Refrain]
When you're by my side, everything's alright
I'm crazy, I'm crazy for you

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, here I go, down that road
Again and again, the fool rushin' in
But I can't help when I feel some kind of way
Do you feel the same?

[Chorus]
'Cause
I'll fall, I'll fall for you
You caught me at my weakest
I'll fall, I'll fall for you
You caught me at my weakest
I'll fall for you

[Bridge]
And now you've gone and got a hold on me
(Hold on me, hold on me)
Tell me what you gonna do to me
(Do to me, do to me)
Oh, now you've gone and got your hands on me
(Touchin' me, touchin' me)
Oh, tell me what you're gonna do

[Pre-Chorus]
Here I go down that road
Again and again, the fool rushin' in
But I can't help when I feel some kind of way
Do you feel the same?

[Outro]
'Cause I'll fall, I'll fall for you
You caught me at my weakest
Yeah, I'll fall, I'll fall for you
You caught me at my weakest
And I'll fall for you[Intro]
Woo-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Woo-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Woo-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Woo-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh

[Verse 1]
I'm a problem, I'm the killer, I'm the cure, I guess
I'm the end, I'm the beginning, the apocalypse
I am something from nothing, I heard 'em say
Rags to the riches, your best mistake
I'm the future, I'm the relic, I'm the "not done yet"

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, oh, oh I am... forevermore I'll be

[Chorus]
What you wanna believe
All I know, it's too late for me to change your mind
What you wanna believe
I'll let go, let you decide
What you wanna believe
What you wanna believe

[Verse 2]
I'm the blaze, I'm the siren, I'm the exit door
I'm the cape, I'm the villain, I'm the metaphor
Or I'm a good gun in a bad man's war, I paved the way
I'm a left hook, I'm a battered jaw, I'm the pain
I'm a preacher, I'm a sinner, I'm a broken Lord

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, oh, oh I am... forevermore I'll be

[Chorus]
What you wanna believe
All I know, it's too late for me to change your mind
What you wanna believe
I'll let go, let you decide
What you wanna believe
What you wanna believe

[Bridge]
Who am I to tell you what you think you see?
It ain't my business to tell you what you think of me

[Chorus]
What you wanna believe
What you wanna believe
What you wanna believe
All I know, it's too late for me to change your mind
What you wanna believe
I'll let go, let you decide
What you wanna believe

[Outro: Spoken Sample]
A path of corruption and destruction
(What you wanna believe)
Everyday that they live
They have another opportunity to be saved[Verse 1]
I know I hurt you, I was so unkind
I was ungrateful, I wasted your time
But I was young and lost, so lost
See, you took this poor boy and changed his whole life
Granted his wishes and dreams overnight
And I saw stars, they shot me down
But I deserved it, they knocked me out

[Chorus]
I'm just waking up now, in the tears of the one's I love
It's quiet, I'll bet that everybody thinks I'm done
I need to get up now, I've been down here far too long
Two years I've been lost, now I remember who I was
Who I was, who I was

[Verse 2]
I am the one who beat me black and blue
No one can hurt all your feelings like you
Whoa, I know it, or validate
See, if you're a misfit and feel out of place
Or you don't like how you look, it's okay
'Cause someone will, but you need to love yourself
Don't end up like me, don't end up like me

[Chorus]
I'm just waking up now, in the tears of the one's I love
It's quiet, I'll bet that everybody thinks I'm done
I need to get up now, I've been down here for too long
Two years I've been lost, now I remember who I was
Who I was, who I was (I've been down here for too...)
Who I was, who I was[Verse 1]
You laugh at all the jokes
Even the ones you know
Funny, I'm doing that too
Alone in a crowded room
The one string that's out of tune
Trust me, I feel like that too

[Chorus]
Let me love the lonely out of you
Let me love the pain you're going through
I think I've saved myself by saving you
Let me love the lonely out of you

[Verse 2]
Lighthouse without the lights
You smile without your eyes
I know, 'cause I do that too
Your own worst enemy
You think that no one sees
I do, 'cause I'm like that too

[Chorus]
Let me love the lonely out of you
Let me love the pain you're going through
I think I've saved myself by saving you
Let me love the lonely out of you

[Bridge]
We can light a fire to warm our bones
This world is much too cold to sleep alone

[Chorus]
Let me love the lonely out of you
Let me love the pain you're going through
I think I've saved myself by saving you
Let me love the lonely out of you

[Outro]
Let me love the lonely out of you
Let me love the pain you're going through
Think I've saved myself by saving you
Let me love the lonely out of you[Intro]
One, two, ready
Here we go

[Verse 1]
It ain't the gun
It's the man behind the trigger
Gets blood on his fingers
And runs
It ain't the lie
It's the way that the truth is denied

[Pre-Chorus]
But if there is one thing that I'm guilty of
It's loving and giving when you take too much
If somebody asked how we died
Please, look them straight in the eye

[Chorus]
Call it suicide
Don't fabricate
Just tell them, babe
It was suicide
Don't sugarcoat it
Just let them know

[Verse 2]
It ain't the knife
It's the way that you use it
How you abuse it in fights
It ain't about the life
You feel you were given
As long as you're living it right

[Pre-Chorus]
If there is one thing that I'm guilty of
It's loving and giving when you take too much
If somebody asked how we died
Oh, you look them straight in the eyes

[Chorus]
Call it suicide
Don't fabricate
Just tell them, babe
It was suicide
Don't sugarcoat it
Just let them know

[Bridge]
You've been killing me softly
And finally, the pain is too much, oh
And I'm all out of whiskey
To soak up the damage you've done, oh
If there's anything I'm guilty of
It's loving you too much
If anybody asks how we died

[Chorus]
Call it suicide
Don't fabricate
Just tell them, babe
It was suicide
Don't sugarcoat it
Just let them know
Call it suicide
Don't fabricate
Just tell them, babe
It was suicide
Don't sugarcoat it
Just let them know

[Outro]
Oh, baby
Just let them know
Oh, just[Verse 1: James Arthur]
You don't have to say you're sorry
Or redeem yourself to me, oh
I'm not asking for confessions
You don't even have to speak, no

[Pre-Chorus: James Arthur]
I need you to feel that you're more than enough
I already know you're deserving of love
There's not a question that you are the one that I need

[Chorus: James Arthur]
These are my words
This is my voice
That is my sermon
Give me your heart
Give me your pain
Give me your burden
'Cause I can take anything that you can give
Forgiving everything that you did
These are my words
This is my voice
That is my sermon
My sermon, yeah, my sermon, yeah
My sermon, yeah, my sermon, yeah

[Verse 2: James Arthur]
Oh, time to turn this wine to water, yeah
Time to turn this gold to lead, oh
Time to stop taking this for granted, oh
Gotta keep my family fed, for life

[Pre-Chorus: James Arthur]
I need you to feel that you're more than enough
I already know you're deserving of love
There's not a question that you are the one I need

[Chorus - James Arthur]
These are my words
This is my voice
That is my sermon
Give me your heart
Give me your pain
Give me your burden
'Cause I can take anything that you can give
Forgiving everything that you did
These are my words
This is my voice
That is my sermon
My sermon, yeah, my sermon, yeah
My sermon, yeah, my sermon, yeah

[Verse 3: Shotty Horroh]
I don't know nothin' about the service
The clergy do in the churches
I never read the book, though I knew the pages were turnin'
I tried to sing the hymns, but I couldn't think of the verses
Tried to confess my sins, but I didn't know how to word it
But this is my sermon, firstly I'm emotionally drained
Self-medicatin', hopin' I can cope with the pain
I need a fix 'cause that'll fix whatever's broke in my brain
Who am I kiddin'? No, I'm goin' insane
I wrote some quotes on this page
Just trying to reach you and I hope you relate
Well, I'll probably just throw them away
'Cause I don't know what to say
I feel weak when I'm supposed to be brave
I seem free, but I'm enclosed in a cage
Do I continue to ponder over the past
Thinkin' I could've done it better?
Do I whimper from the future
And buckle under the pressure?
Or do I step to the plate, and go take the chance with my life
Come face to face with the darkness
So I can stand in the light, like

[Bridge: James Arthur]
When I feel your love upon me
I know that I am truly blessed
Sometimes you've gotta face the darkness
To step into the light again

[Chorus/Outro]
These are my words
My voice
That is my sermon
Give me your heart
Give me your pain
Give me your burden
'Cause I can take anything that you can give
Forgiving everything that you did
These are my words
This is my voice
That is my sermon
My sermon, yeah, my sermon, yeah
My sermon, yeah, my sermon, yeah
My sermon, yeah, my sermon, yeah
My sermon, yeah, my sermon, yeah
My sermon, yeah, my sermon, yeah
My sermon, yeah, my sermon, yeah
That is my sermon[Verse 1]
It was good to be there in the bright lights, oh
But I lost good friends under the spotlight, oh
Imagine if everybody knew your name
But they had nothing nice to say, nothing nice to say
It was good to be living up the high life, oh
But the comedown's harder in the headlines, oh
And everybody tells you, you should play the game
But there's only you to play, there's only you to play
Well I tried

[Chorus 1]
I set fire to the glory
I set fire to the dream
I set fire to the only thing that lead me from the streets
Don't tell me it's over, 'cause I don't want to believe
'Cause now I've opened my eyes and I have found a way to breathe
The truth sets me free

[Verse 2]
I broke my back to make a breakthrough, oh
I lost my mind, look what it came to, oh
I had to lose it all so I could understand, oh
I was just a boy in the shadow of a man

[Chorus 2]
I set fire to the glory
I set fire to the dream
I set fire to the only thing that lead me from the streets
Don't tell me it's over, 'cause I don't want to believe
'Cause now I've opened my eyes and I have found a way to breathe
The truth sets me free
Oh, the truth sets me free

[Bridge]
I set fire to the glory
I set fire to the dream
I set fire to the only thing that lead me from the streets

[Chorus]
Don't tell me it's over, 'cause I don't want to believe
'Cause now I've opened my eyes and I have found a way to breathe
The truth sets me free
Oh, it sets me free

[Outro]
Oh, the truth sets me
Oh, it sets me free
Oh, the truth sets me free
It sets me free
Oh, the truth sets me free
Oh, it sets me free
Oh, the truth sets me free
Oh, it sets me free
It sets me free[Verse 1]
I don't want to play this game no more
I don't wanna play it
I don't want to stay 'round here no more
I don't wanna stay here
Like rain on a Monday morning
Like pain that just keeps on going on

Look at all the hate they keep on showing
I don't want to see that
Look at all the stones they keep on throwing
I don't want to feel that
Like Sun that will keep on burning
I used to be so discerning, oh

[Chorus]
In my recovery
Im a soldier at war
I have broken down walls
I defined
I designed
My recovery

In the sound of the sea
In the oceans of me
I defined
I designed
My recovery

Keep soaring
Keep song-writing
Keep soaring
Keep song-writing
My recovery

[Verse 2]
And I can hear the choirs keep on singing
Tell me what theyre saying
And I can hear the phone
It keeps on ringing
I dont want to answer
I know that I used to listen
And I know Ive become dismissive, oh

[Chorus]
In my recovery
Im a soldier at war
I have broken down walls
I defined
I designed
My recovery

In the sound of the sea
In the oceans of me
I defined
I designed
My recovery

Keep soaring
Keep song-writing
Keep soaring
Keep song-writing
My recovery

[Bridge]
In my recovery
Im a soldier at war
I have broken down walls
I defined
I designed
My recovery

In the sound of the sea
In the oceans of me
I defined
I designed
My recovery

[Outro]
Keep soaring
Keep song-writing
Keep soaring
Keep song-writing
My recovery

Keep soaring
Keep song-writing
Keep soaring
Keep song-writing
My recovery

Keep soaring
Keep song-writing[Verse 1]
This is all I ever wanted
All I ever thought I'd be
It's the only place I truly feel
As though I can be me

[Pre-Chorus 1]
But the way I arrived
It was overnight
I've been on my worst behaviour
Been on my worst behaviour

[Chorus]
If only it ain't been like this
Now I can hold my heart in a fist
And all the voices leave
I can finally put it on my sleeve
Oh, if only they'd really seen it
Maybe they would finally believe me
When I say I've won
And my father gets to see his son
That he can feel proud of
He can feel proud of
He's proud of me

[Verse 2]
This is all I ever wanted
All I ever thought I'd be
But the way that I behaved
Could have seen quite the contrary

[Pre-Chorus 2]
I felt all the lives
They're out of sight
I've been on my worst behaviour
Been on my worst behaviour

[Chorus]
If only I ain't been like this
Now I can hold my heart in a fist
And all the voices leave
I can finally put it on my sleeve
Oh, if only they'd really seen it
Maybe they would finally believe me
When I say I've won
And my mother gets to see her son
That she can feel proud of
She can feel proud of
She's proud of me

[Bridge]
She's proud of me
They're proud of me
They're proud of me
They're proud of me
She's proud of me
She's proud of
She's proud of
They're proud of
They're proud of
They're proud of me
They're proud of me
They're proud of me
She's proud of
They're proud of

[Chorus]
If only I ain't been like this
Now I can hold my heart in a fist
And all the voices leave
I can finally put it on my sleeve
Oh, if only they had really seen it
Then maybe they would finally believe me
When I say I've won
And my family gets to see their
That they can feel proud of
They can feel proud of
They can feel proud of
They're proud of me[Verse 1]
We're all strangers
Fighting in the streets with no common ground
We're just strangers
Tryna find release whenthere'snone around
Then there'syou
You don't feel that much astranger
You stand out from all the crowds
I don't feel that much in danger
I was lost till I found you

[Chorus]
Baby, baby, won't you please come rescue me?
I don't really wanna stay if you're not
All I know is that I need you, baby
Hold me close so I can finally breathe

[Verse 2]
We're all strangers
Fighting gravity, stuck here on the ground
We're just strangers
Tryna keep the peace when there's none around
Then there's you
You're my little ray of sunshine
You are immortality
You make me forget about time
And how it's comin' for me, so

[Chorus]
Baby, baby, won't you please come rescue me?
I don't really wanna stay if you're not
All I know is that I need you, baby
Hold me close so I can finally breathe
Finally breathe, finally breathe
Hold me close so I can finally

[Bridge]
When you tell me that you love me, babe
You bring the sun and take away my pain
And the anxiety is miles away
I didn't know that I could feel that way
I didn't know life was so beautiful till I held you
Oh, yeah
Your eyes make me feel like I'm off floating on air
When you look at me, fuck everything else but you, yeah
I don't wanna be there, so

[Chorus]
Baby, baby, won't you please come rescue me?
I don't really wanna stay if you're not
All I know is that I need you, baby
Hold me close so I can finally
Hold me close so I can finally
Hold me close so I can finally
Breathe[Verse 1]
I've been beaten and broken and tread upon
I was made to feel stupid when Iwasyoung
And they say,"No is the answer to thetemptations"
When those demons come rushing, nowhere to run

[Chorus]
Sometimes I feel nothing at all
Sometimes I want someone to hold
Sometimes I carry on
Just to stumble down once more
Sometimes I, I, I wanna fall

[Verse 2]
I teach love is the fluid in all my songs, mm-mm
But then I faked my way through it with alcohol
I speak the language so fluid
Lost in translation
But I guess they don't see you in their camera phones, oh no

[Chorus]
Sometimes I feel nothing at all
Sometimes I want someone to hold
Sometimes I carry on
Just to stumble down once more
Sometimes I, I, I wanna fall
Yeah, yeah, oh, I just wanna fall down, I just wanna fall
Yeah, oh, I just wanna fall, I just wanna fall
Sometimes I, I carry on, ooh, just to stumble down once more
Sometimes I, I, I wanna fall[Verse 1]
I wanna wake up sober
See what the sunrise means to me
'Cause I've been getting colder
Andnothingmeans anything
I wannareally hold ya
And feel the groundbeneath my feet
'Cause when it's all all over
Don't wanna miss anything

[Pre-Chorus]
Putting out cigarettes on my bed
Only friends never up in my head
When you hit bottom, only place to go is up

[Chorus]
When I found me, I was smiling
And through the crying, I finally feel good
When I broke free from the old me
I was singing, "I finally feel good"

[Verse 2]
I was getting closer
But I was getting in my way
We're only getting older
I keep on making the same mistakes
Self-inflicted torture
It no longer gets me high
And finally I want to
Follow my own lullaby

[Pre-Chorus]
Trying to remember what my mother said
Middle finger up to my twisted head
When you hit bottom, only place to go is up

[Chorus]
When I found me, I was smiling
And through the crying, I finally feel good
When I broke free from the old me
I was singing, "I finally feel good," oh-oh

[Bridge]
(Ha-ah-ah, ha-ah-ah) To be in my own skin
(Ha-ah-ah, ha-ah-ah) It finally feels like home, yeah
(Ha-ah-ah, ha-ah-ah) I keep telling myself, yeah
(Ha-ah-ah, ha-ah-ah) You don't have to be alone

[Chorus]
When I found me (Will I?)
I was smiling (I was smiling, yeah)
And through the crying (And through the crying)
I finally feel good (I finally feel)
When I broke free (When I broke free, broke free)
From the old me (From the old me, old me)
I was singing (Yeah, yeah)
"I finally feel good" (I finally feel good, baby)

[Outro]
(Ha-ah-ah, ha-ah-ah) Oh, I finally feel good, baby
(Ha-ah-ah, ha-ah-ah) Oh, I finally feel good, baby
Oh, I finally feel good, baby
(Ha-ah-ah, ha-ah-ah) Oh, I finally feel good, baby
(Ha-ah-ah, ha-ah-ah) Oh, I finally feel good
(Ha-ah-ah, ha-ah-ah) Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Ooh[Verse 1]
If I'm underneath the table
Then pour me another drink
Oh, I don't want to remember
I don't even want to think

I'm a slave to my addiction
I'm a hazard to myself
On a fast track to perdition
Oh, I'm heading straight to hell

[Pre-Chorus]
When I throw up out your window
You should confiscate my key
I will drive you up the fucking wall
Is it too late to believe

[Chorus]
I tried so hard to change
But the devil locked my door
I wear these heavy chains around my neck
Like a prisoner
I just want to love
But he won't let me go
Loosen up my chains
Or I'm a condemned prisoner

[Verse 2]
I was stood there in the spotlight
With this city at my feet
But I was a dead man walking
Nothing ever comes for free

So I moved on down to London
Where I traded in my soul
I could not fill my heart
With all those one night stands and gold

[Pre-Chorus]
So throw me out your mom's house
I've been living there too long
Well she never liked me anyway
Cause she knows I'm northern scum

[Chorus]
I tried so hard to change
But the devil locked my door
I wear these heavy chains around my neck
Like a prisoner
I just wanna love
But he won't let me go
Loosen up my chains
Or I'm a condemned prisoner

[Bridge]
I think my minds on the blink
So I get high, so high and I drink
I suffered enough of the heart palps when I think
Discovered it up at the bar 9 drinks in
Now I'm at the disco, convinced the girls think I'm the bizzo
Course I'm on the brink
Looking at me funny then course I'm gonna swing
Karaoke? Course I wanna sing
Or pour me another drink
It always ends the same
Or I'm a condemned prisoner

[Chorus]
I tried so hard to change
But the devil locked my door
I wear these heavy chains around my neck
Like a prisoner
I just wanna love
But he won't let me go
Loosen up my chains
Or I'm a condemned prisoner[Verse 1]
One beat, one life
One me, let the other side go
Oh-oh-oh
I live and die by yourknife
Thisis homicide love
Tellme, could you make me, oh
Allthat you want?
Would you fly home?
Or could it ever be just us?

[Chorus]
Tell me what you're waiting for
Hold me like you did before
Or just run away, run away, run away
'Cause I don't think I could take much more
Why you always waging war?
Tell me why I'm keeping score
Oh, would you give me one, give me one, give me one more
Lie if this was truly love?
Truly love

[Verse 2]
You need your space
I can't breathe when we go your pace
Oh-oh-oh
You make me sick, but all I wanna do is kiss your lips
I'm such a sucker for sweet-talking, yeah
So do you tell all your friends
You've got your gun to my head?
I know it's never gonna be just us

[Chorus]
Tell me what you're waiting for
Hold me like you did before
Or just run away, run away, run away
'Cause I don't think I can take much more
Why you always waging war?
Tell me why I'm keeping score
Oh, would you give me one, give me one, give me one more
Life if this was truly love?

[Post-Chorus]
Love, love
Love
Or is it nothing?
Or is it nothing?
Is it love? Love

[Outro]
Oh, you tear me down
You build me up
Kill me slow with your love
And I will try to be your love
Enough
I live and die by your knife
This is homicide loveI said forgive us for what we have done
'cause we're young, we're young, we're young
I said forgive us for where we come done
'cause we're young, yeh

I've made a lot of mistakes in my past
But I refuse to live there, nah
I saw a lot of hearts break in the past
But I refuse to go there, agh
It hurts too much, I'm looking for a crutch
I'm looking for just any girl, just for a touch
I let my angst out, i let myself go
And when I let myself down I just swag it out
Uh, uh, baby girl I,d like to dance
Uh! But I'm just looking for a brief romance
What's wrong with that? Im young, forgive me
I live fast, die a legend, Whitney

Oh, oh we're young, oh

Forgive us for what we have done
We're young, we're young, we're young
I said forgive us for what we have done
'cause we're young, we're young, we're young
Oh we're young, we're young, we're young
We're young, we're young, we're young[Verse 1]
I don't know what's going on
Where you came from and why it took so long
AllIknow is thatI feel it like it's therealest thing, I mean it
Something changed when I saw you
Oh, my eyes can't lie
You said, "They're so damn blue"
And I love how you're so forward
Is it too soon to say I'm falling?

[Chorus]
So maybe
Maybe we were always meant to meet
Like this was all our destiny
Like you already know
Your heart will never be broken by me
So is it crazy
For you to tell your friends to go on home?
So we can be here all alone
Fall in love tonight
And spend the rest of our lives as one

[Verse 2]
I should take your hand and make you come with me
Away from all this noise and impurity
'Cause I feel like you're too perfect
And I don't mean just on the surface
So don't be scared, I am too
'Cause this chemistry between me and you
Is too much to just ignore it
So I'll admit it now, I'm falling

[Chorus]
So maybe
Maybe we were always meant to meet
Like this was all our destiny
Like you already know
Your heart will never be broken by me
Oh, is it so crazy
For you to tell your brothers about me?
Here's hoping they'll protect ya but I'll look them in the eye
Tell them you and I will be as one

[Post-Chorus]
You and I, you and I as one
You and I as one
You and I, you and I will be as one
Oh darling, you and I will be as one

[Outro]
As one, oh
All I know is that I feel it
Like it's the realest thing, I mean it[Verse 1]
I still remember my name
But forgotten my royal mistakes
If only
I could go back in time
When you were a friend of mine
If only
We were just a little less tired and true
You were being you, and I was being too human
But who was I fooling
Ohh if only

[Chorus]
If only I could trust you'd
Rest your head and turn the light on
If only I could wish your kiss was not a falling star
If only I was yours, the shoulder that you'd wanna to cry on
If only you could pull me safely through these prison bars
Ehh if only

(If only, if only)
(If only, if only)

[Verse 2]
I took your crown of thorns
Laid down to be reborn
If only
I wasn't flesh and bone
I could rise up from being stoned
If only

You could see through someone like me
Tryna be free, maybe just a little less lonely
Ohh I was so lonely
If only

[Chorus]
If only I could trust you'd
Rest your head and turn the light on (If only, if only)
If only I could wish your kiss was not a falling star
(If only, if only)
If only I was yours, the shoulder that you'd wanna to cry on
(If only, if only)
If only you could pull me safely through these prison bars
(If only)
Ehh if only

[Bridge]
It's out with the old, I'll be new
And don't worry about the drink and drugs, I am through
If only I believed that was true
We'd be living all the dreams in a house with a view
If only, if only you knew how the voices of demons could drown out the truth
Now my one place of freedom is sleeping with you
If only, if only you knew

[Chorus]
If only I could trust you'd
Rest your head and turn the light on
If only I could wish your kiss was not a falling star
If only, If only I was your shoulder to cry on
If only you could pull me safely through these prison bars
Ehh if only

[Outro]
If only, if only
If only[Verse 1]
You wear the burden
World on your shoulders, baby
So let me hold the weight
I know you'rehurting
Deepas the coldestpain
But this is the order sayin

[Pre-Chorus]
I'mgonna show you everything's alright
End of the tunnel, there is always light
Youre in the middle of the darkest night
I know you're hurting, baby
Whenever you look at me with those

[Chorus]
Those sad eyes
I'm gonna dry your sad eyes
I'll make it right, so don't cry
I'm gonna dry those sad eyes

[Verse 2]
Under the streetlights
You've turned and said to me that youre no good for me
That was the first lie youve ever said to me
Oh baby, honestly

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm gonna show you everythings alright
End of the tunnel, there is always light
You're in the middle of the darkest night
I know you're hurting, baby
Whenever you look at me with those

[Chorus]
Those sad eyes

Ill make it right, so don't cry
I'm gonna dry those sad eyes

[Post-Chorus]
And baby, even when your troubled tears are falling
Darling, you should know you still look beautiful
Sad eyes

I'll make it right

[Bridge]
Mmm
Everything will be alright, I swear
Everything will be alright, I swear
Everything will be alright, I swear
Oh-oh

[Chorus]
Those sad eyes

I'll make it, I'll make it right
I'll make it right, I'll make it right
I'll make it right[Verse 1]
I'm packin' my bags that I didn't unpack the last time
I'm sayin', "see you again" so many times it's becomin' my tag line
But you know the truth, I'd rather hold you
Than try to catch this flight
So many things I'd rather say
But for now, it's "goodbye"

[Pre-Chorus]
You say I'm always leavin'
You, when you're sleepin' alone
But the car's outside
But I don't wanna go tonight

[Chorus]
I'm not gettin' in the Addison Lee
Unless you pack your bags
You're comin' with me
I'm tired of lovin' from afar
And never being where you are
Close the windows, lock the doors
Don't wanna leave you anymore

[Verse 2]
I'm starin' at the same four walls in a different hotel
It's an unfamiliar feelin', but I know it so well
Oh, but you know the truth, I'd rather hold you
Than this mobile in my hand
But I guess it'll do
'Cause for you, I would run up my phone bill

[Pre-Chorus]
You say I'm always leavin'
You, when you need me the most, but darling
But the car's outside
But I don't wanna go tonight

[Chorus]
I'm not gettin' in the Addison Lee
Unless you pack your bags
You're comin' with me
I'm tired of lovin' from afar
And never being where you are
Close the windows, lock the doors
Don't wanna leave you anymore

[Post-Chorus]
Ooh-ooh, ah
Ooh-ooh, ah
Ooh-ooh, ah
Don't wanna leave you anymore

[Bridge]
Oh, darling, all of the city lights
Never shine as bright as your eyes
I would trade them all for a minute more
But the car's outside
And he's called me twice
But he's gonna have to wait tonight

[Chorus]
I'm not gettin' in the Addison Lee
Unless you pack your bags
You're comin' with me
I'm tired of lovin' from afar
And never being where you are
Close the windows, lock the doors
Don't wanna leave you anymore

[Post-Chorus]
Ooh-ooh, ah
Ooh-ooh, ah
Ooh-ooh, ah
No, I don't wanna leave you anymore
I don't wanna leave you
I don't wanna leave you
I don't wanna leave you
Don't wanna leave you anymore[Verse 1]
How can someone so beautiful as you be such a terrible human?
I lay in bedatnight and wonderto myself, what the fuck arewe doing? Yeah
But I like the way that you always stand up for yourself
But you gotta take it too far, and you drag me through hell
Honey, you know how to turn me around, don't know how you do it

[Pre-Chorus]
So let's smoke (So let's smoke)
Let's drink (Let's drink)
Till we're fuckin' in the bathroom, leanin' over the sink
So let's dance (So let's dance)
Let's grind (Let's grind)
We've only gotta make it till the end of the night

[Chorus]
'Cause if we can get through this, we can get through anything
There's nothing we can't forgive, we can get through anything
I believe in you, you believe in me
And I guess that's all that matters
So if we can get through this, we can get through anything, oh
If we can get through this, we can get through

[Verse 2]
Yeah
I'm pretty sure there must be someone out there who'll take care of me better
'Cause something scares the living shit outta me about saying forever, yeah
But I like the way that you sit up there on your high horse
You make me feel like if I left, it would be my loss
I'm still here, baby, I'm your prisoner for the foreseeable future, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
So let's smoke (So let's smoke)
Let's drink (Let's drink)
Till we're fuckin' in the bathroom, leanin' over the sink
So let's dance (So let's dance)
Let's grind (Let's grind)
We've only gotta make it till the end of the night

[Chorus]
'Cause if we can get through this, we can get through anything, mmm
There's nothing we can't forgive, we can get through anything
I believe in you, you believe in me
And I guess that's all that matters
So if we can get through this, we can get through anything (Through anything)

[Bridge]
Oh, I believe we can get
Oh-whoa, yeah

[Chorus]
'Cause if we can get through this, we can get through anything, mmm (Oh, we can get through)
There's nothing we can't forgive, we can get through anything (We can get through anything)
I believe in you, you believe in me
And I guess that's all that matters (All, all, yeah)
So if we can get through this, we can get through anything, oh
If we can get through this, we can get through[Verse 1]
When I look at you, it's like I've been baptised
It's so spiritual, like I've been sanctified
Oh, I'm drunk in love, and you're Beyonc

[Pre-Chorus]
Let's get it on, all I gotta say is I, I, I, I

[Chorus]
I feel like a rolling stoner
Don't think I can keep my composure
Girl until the night is over
I don't have a thought that is sober

[Verse 2]
Won't you take it off, and leave it all behind
If you let me darling, I could ease your mind
Baby making love with you is all I want

[Pre-Chorus]
Let's get it on, all I wanna say is I, I, I, I

[Chorus]
I feel like a rolling stoner
Don't think I can keep my composure
Girl until the night is over
I don't have a thought that is sober

[Bridge]
Heat me up like a soup, baby
Smoke me up till your pupils' crazy
Double vision, everybody singing in sync
R. Kelly, remix to ignition
There are so many women, yeah, living in the minute
They're stripping in my living room
I wanna be with you
You're just different like Lana Del Rey
You could play me all day, like a video game
Like a video game
All I gotta say

[Chorus]
I feel like a rolling stoner
I've had too many Coca Cola's
Living the la vida loca
I don't have a thought that is sober
I feel like a rolling stoner
Don't think I can keep my composure
Girl until the night is over
I don't have a thought that is sober[Verse 1]
She said, "It's all your fault"
I said, "It always is"
She sang my favorite song
But withalittle twist
Her lipstick,you collar, don't bother, angel
I knowexactly what goes on
I know exactly what goes on

[Chorus]
She said, "I'm walking alone this time"
I'll be waiting all my life
Did it ever cross your mind
Just what you're doing?
All you ever had to see
Was love me unconditionally
Oh, I won't go
I will live till it's over
Oh, I won't go
Until hell freezes over
And I'll be yours
And you'll be my supernova
Oh darlin', why was it so hard tosee?
Justlove me unconditionally

[Verse 2]
And after all your flaws
I still stay in this
There's no Santa Claus
I know it don't exist
Her lipstick, you collar, don't bother, angel
I know exactly what goes on
I know exactly what goes on

[Chorus]
She said, "I'm walking alone this time"
I'll be waiting all my life
Did it ever cross your mind
Just what you're doing?
All you ever had to see
Was love me unconditionally
Oh, I won't go
I will live 'til it's over
Oh, I won't go
Until hell freezes over
And I'll be yours
I'll be your supernova
Oh darlin', why was it so hard tosee?
Justlove me unconditionally[Verse 1 - James Arthur]
I could've chose anybody but I chose you
Ooh ooh
Help me get better, you pull me right out of the blue
Oh oh
And daddy don't like you but daddy and I never speak
Ee ee
Every night when I wake up I need you to get back to sleep
Ee ee

[Chorus- James Arthur]
Smells like roses to me
Two young lovers at sea
Tastes so bitter and so sweet
You're my bang, together we go bang bang bang
Bang bang bang
Bang bang bang
Oh oh, oh oh

[Verse 2 - Emeli Sand]
You could've chose anybody but you chose me
Ee ee
Hiding in bed since cause no one around us agrees
Ee ees
And I feel romantic cause since morning I've been acting wild
I, I
Shall we eat all the poison and leave all the questions behind
I, I

[Chorus - Both]
Smells like roses to me
Two young lovers at sea
Tastes so bitter and so sweet
You're my bang, together we go bang bang bang
Bang bang bang
Bang bang bang

[Bridge - James Arthur]
And all the chemicals and alcohol make for a volatile love
But stay with me
Just stay with me
And I never wanna lose you but I feel that this closeness will tear us apart
But stay with me
Stay with me
Bang, bang, bang (x4)

[Chorus - Both]
Smells like roses to me
Two young lovers at sea
Tastes so bitter and so sweet
You're my bang, together we go bang bang bang[Verse 1]
I never meant to leave you there, a crown of roses in your hair
Along with everything you ever feared
In every step I see your face, and even though I'm miles away
Just close your eyes, and you can feel me here
Feel me here

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't give up even when I'm gone
Don't give up

[Chorus]
From the grave, I crawl
Through pouring rain for you
I would pay the cost to
Be in your arms again
The fire I would walk through
For all the pain I caused you
Oh, I would pay the cost to
Be in your arms again
To be in your arms again
To be in your arms again

[Verse 2]
Now, I'll always be right where you were
No borders can keep us apart
And on the other side, I'll meet you there
So bury me and lock me in
I'll find a way to rise again
I'll break away and find you anywhere
Oh, anywhere

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't give up even when I'm gone
Don't give up

[Chorus]
From the grave, I crawl
Through pouring rain for you
I would pay the cost to
Be in your arms again
The fire I would walk through
For all the pain I caused you
Oh, I would pay the cost to
Be in your arms again
To be in your arms again
To be in your arms again (Oh, yeah)

[Chorus]
From the grave, I crawl
Through pouring rain for you
I would pay the cost to
Be in your arms again
The fire I would walk through
For all the pain I caused you
Oh, I would pay the cost to
Be in your arms again
To be in your arms again

[Outro]
To be in your arms again[Verse 1]
Let me, let me begin
Let me begin with an I owe you
Who I owe everything to
Lately, lately my friend
Lately, you think I'm ignoring you
But I've been trying to pull through

[Pre-Chorus]
All of the pain, I know you're looking down, down on me
I could have been someone
I hurt everyone
Pushed away everyone who got near

[Chorus]
Tell me, something that I don't know
I couldn't let you go
Fell on my knees
Turned my face to the rain
That's when you heard my call
Sold me my stubborn soul
Phoenix is rising, it's rising again
Oo, oo, oo
Woah, oo, oo
Woah, oo, oo

[Verse 2]
Save me, save me again
Save me the way that you did before
Cause no one ever could have loved me more
Give me, give me the strength
Give me the strength when I need it more
Give me the reason that I'm looking for

[Pre-Chorus]
I was a pain, they were looking down, down on me
I could have been someone
I hurt everyone
Pushed away everyone that was near

[Chorus]
Tell me, something that I don't know
I couldn't let you go
Fell on my knees
Turned my face to the rain
That's when you heard my call
Sold me my stubborn soul
The phoenix is rising, it's rising again
Oo, oo, oo
Woah, oo, oo
Woah, oo, oo
Rising, woah, oo, oo
It's rising, woah, oo, oo
It's rising, woah, oo, oo

[Bridge]
You took the pain
When my world caved down on me
Now I have someone
Cause you came and you showed me the world

[Chorus]
Tell me, something that I don't know
I couldn't let you go (I couldn't let)
Fell on my knees (on my knees)
Turned my face to the rain
That's when you heard my call
Sold me my stubborn soul (you sold me my soul)
Phoenix is rising, it's rising again (phoenix is rising)
Tell me, something that I don't know
I couldn't let you go
Fell on my knees
Turned my face to the rain
That's when you heard my call
Sold me my stubborn soul
Phoenix is rising[Verse 1]
This hidden thing
That you don't see
They call them skeletons
Don't be scared of them
'Cause you're still you
And I'm still me
It's all irrelevant
We all got skeletons

[Pre-Chorus]
You could tell me everything
And then we could forget it
Baby, you could show me all your demons in a minute
It could be a battle
When the words come back around, around
We don't ever got to tell a lie
And then relive it
I could show you demons
Only you could take a minute
Show me that you'll be there
When the walls come crashing down

[Chorus]
When you're holding back the words
'Cause you're afraid of being hurt
Just let love in
Just let love in
Oh, we're only skin and bone
We don't have to be alone
Just let love in
Just let love in
I just let love in
Just let love in

[Verse 2]
Sink or swim
What will it be?
We all got skeletons
Set them free
But now I'm over it
And I'm under you
So tell me everything
Take a trip to the moon

[Chorus]
Oh, when you're holding back the words
'Cause you're afraid of being hurt
Just let love in
Just let love in
Oh, we're only skin and bone
We don't have to be alone
Just let love in
Just let love in
I just let love in
Just let love in

[Bridge]
You could tell me everything
And then we could forget it
Baby, you could show me all your demons in a minute
It could be a battle
When the words come back around, around
We don't ever got to tell a lie
And then relive it
I could show you demons
Only you could take a minute
Tell me that you'll be there
When the walls come crashing down, down

[Chorus]
Oh, when you're holding back the words
'cause you're afraid of being hurt
Just let love in
Just let love in
Oh, we're only skin and bone
We don't have to be alone
Just let love in
Just let love in
I just let love in
Just let love in
I just let love in
Just let love in[Verse 1]
Well, you done done me, and you bet I felt it
I tried to be chill, but you're so hot that I melted
I fell right through the cracks
And now I'm trying to get back
Before the cool done run out
I'll be giving it my bestest
And nothing's gonna stop me but divine intervention
I reckon it's again my turn
To win some or learn some

[Chorus]
But I won't hesitate no more
No more it cannot wait, I'm yours
Hmm (Hey, hey)

[Verse 2]
Well, open up your mind and see like me
Open up your plans and, damn, you're free
And look into your heart, and you'll find love, love, love, love
Listen to the music of the moment, people dance and sing
We're just one big family
And it's our God-forsaken right to be loved, love, love, love, loved

[Chorus]
So I won't hesitate no more
No more it cannot wait, I'm sure

[Post-Chorus]
There's no need to complicate
Our time is short
This is our fate, I'm yours
A-do you, do, do, do you, but do you, do you, do, do, but do you want to come on?
Scooch on over closer, dear
And I will nibble your ear
A-soo da ba ba ba ba bum
Whoa, oh oh oh
Whoa, oh oh oh oh whoa whoa whoa
Uh-huh, hmm

[Verse 3]
I've been spending way too long checking my tongue in the mirror
And bending over backwards just to try to see it clearer
But my breath fogged up the glass
And so I drew a new face and I laughed
I guess what I've been saying is there ain't no better reason
To rid yourself of vanities and just go with the seasons
It's what we aim to do
Our name is our virtue

[Chorus]
But I won't hesitate no more
No more it cannot wait, I'm yours

[Verse 4]
Well, open up your mind and see like me (I won't hesitate)
Open up your plans and, damn, you're free (No more, no more)
And look into your heart, and you'll find that (It cannot wait)
The sky is yours (I'm sure there's no)
So please don't, please don't, please don't (No need, oh, now now)
There's no need to complicate (For the reggae, our time)
'Cause our time is short (Is short, this)
This oh, this oh, this is our fate (Is our fate)
I'm yours, ha!

[Outro]
Brr da ba mmm da ba bo mmm day
Na ch doo, doo ch doo, doo ch doo doo mmm doo doo
(Hey, hey) Oh, I'm yours, oh-oh, I'm yours
Oh-oh-oh-oh, whoa-oh-oh-oh
Baby, do you believe I'm yours?
You best believe, you best believe I'm yours, hmm[Verse 1]
When I look into your eyes
It's like watching the night sky
Or a beautiful sunrise
Well, there's so much they hold
And just like them old stars
I see that you've come so far
To be right where you are
How old is your soul?

[Pre-Chorus]
Well, I won't give up on us
Even if the skies get rough
I'm giving you all my love
I'm still looking up

[Pre-Chorus 2]
And when you're needing your space
To do some navigating
I'll be here patiently waiting
To see what you find

[Chorus]
'Cause even the stars, they burn
Some even fall to the earth
We've got a lot to learn
God knows we're worth it
No, I won't give up

[Bridge]
I don't wanna be someone who walks away so easily
I'm here to stay and make the difference that I can make
Our differences, they do a lot to teach us how to use the tools and gifts
We got yeah, we got a lot at stake
And in the end, you're still my friend, at least we did intend
For us to work, we didn't break, we didn't burn
We had to learn, how to bend without the world caving in
I had to learn what I got, and what I'm not
And who I am

[Chorus 2]
I won't give up on us
Even if the skies get rough
I'm giving you all my love
I'm still looking up
I'm still looking up

[Chorus 3]
Well, I won't give up on us
God knows I'm tough enough
We got a lot to learn
God knows we're worth it (And we're worth it)

[Outro]
I won't give up on us
Even if the skies get rough
I'm giving you all my love
I'm still looking up[Verse 1]
May you have auspiciousness and causes of success
May you have the confidence to always do your best
May you take no effort in your being generous
Sharing what you can, nothing more nothing less
May you know the meaning of the word happiness
May you always lead from the beating in your chest
May you be treated like an esteemed guest
May you get to rest, may you catch your breath

[Pre-Chorus]
And may the best of your todays be the worst of your tomorrows
And may the road less paved be the road that you follow

[Chorus]
Well here's to the hearts that you're gonna break
Here's to the lives that you're gonna change
Here's to the infinite possible ways to love you
I want you to have it
Here's to the good times we're gonna have
You dont need money, you got a free pass
Here's to the fact that I'll be sad without you
I want you to have it all

[Post-Chorus]
Oh! I want you to have it all
I want you to have it
I want you to have it all

[Verse 2]
May you be as fascinating as a slap bracelet
May you keep the chaos and the clutter off your desk
May you have unquestionable health and less stress
Having no possessions though immeasurable wealth
May you get a gold star on your next test
May your educated guesses always be correct
And may you win prizes shining like diamonds
May you really own it each moment to the next

And may the best of your todays be the worst of your tomorrows
And may the road less paved be the road that you follow

[Chorus]
Well here's to the hearts that you're gonna break
Here's to the lives that you're gonna change
Here's to the infinite possible ways to love you
I want you to have it
Here's to the good times we're gonna have
You dont need money, you got a free pass
Here's to the fact that I'll be sad without you
I want you to have it all

Oh! I want you to have it all
I want you to have it
I want you to have it all

[Bridge]
Oh, I want you to have it all
All you can imagine
All, no matter what your path is
If you believe it then anything can happen
Go, go, go raise your glasses
Go, go, go you can have it all
I toast you

[Chorus]
Here's to the hearts that you're gonna break
Here's to the lives that you're gonna change
Here's to the infinite possible ways to love you
I want you to have it
Here's to the good times we're gonna have
You dont need money, you got a free pass
Here's to the fact that I'll be sad without you
I want you to have it all

Oh! I want you to have it all
I want you to have it
I want you to have it all

[Outro]
Here's to the good times we're gonna have
Here's to you always making me laugh
Here's to the fact that I'll be sad without you
I want you to have it all[Verse 1: Jason Mraz]
Do you hear me, I'm talking to you
Across the water across the deep blue ocean
Under the open sky, oh my, baby, I'm trying

[Verse 2: Colbie Caillat]
Boy, I hear you in my dreams
I feel your whisper across the sea
I keep you with me in my heart
You make it easier when life gets hard

[Chorus: Jason Mraz & Colbie Caillat]
Lucky I'm in love with my best friend
Lucky to have been where I have been
Lucky to be coming home again
Ooohh ooooh oooh oooh ooh ooh ooh ooh

[Verse 3: Jason Mraz & Colbie Caillat]
They don't know how long it takes
Waiting for a love like this
Every time we say goodbye
I wish we had one more kiss
I'll wait for you, I promise you, I will

[Chorus: Jason Mraz & Colbie Caillat]
Lucky I'm in love with my best friend
Lucky to have been where I have been
Lucky to be coming home again
Lucky we're in love in every way
Lucky to have stayed where we have stayed
Lucky to be coming home someday

[Verse 4: Jason Mraz]
And so I'm sailing through the sea
To an island where we'll meet
You'll hear the music fill the air
I'll put a flower in your hair

[Verse 5: Colbie Caillat]
Though the breezes through the trees
Move so pretty you're all I see
As the world keeps spinning round
You hold me right here right now

[Chorus: Jason Mraz & Colbie Caillat]
Lucky I'm in love with my best friend
Lucky to have been where I have been
Lucky to be coming home again
Lucky we're in love in every way
Lucky to have stayed where we have stayed
Lucky to be coming home someday

[Outro: Jason Mraz & Colbie Caillat]
Ooooh ooooh oooh oooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
Ooooh ooooh oooh oooh ooh ooh ooh ooh[Verse 1]
93 million miles from the Sun, people get ready get ready
Cause here it comes it's a light, a beautiful light, over the horizon into our eyes
Oh, my my how beautiful, oh my beautiful mother
She told me, "Son in life you're gonna go far, and if you do it right you'll love where you are
Just know, that wherever you go, you can always come back home"

[Chorus]
Ohh, ohh, ohh
Ohh, ohh, ohh

[Verse 2]
240 thousand miles from the Moon, we've come a long way to belong here
To share this view of the night, a glorious night, over the horizon is another bright sky
Oh, my my how beautiful, oh my irrefutable father
He told me, "Son sometimes it may seem dark, but the absence of the light is a necessary part
Just know, you're never alone, you can always come back home"

[Chorus]
Ohh, ohh, ohh
Ohh, ohh, ohh

[Verse 3]
You can always come back, back

Every road is a slippery slope
There is always a hand that you can hold on to
Looking deeper through the telescope
You can see that your home's inside of you

Just know, that wherever you go, no you're never alone, you can always get back home

[Chorus]
Ohh, ohh, ohh
Ohh, ohh, ohh

[Outro]
93 million miles from the Sun, people get ready get ready
Cause here it comes it's a light, a beautiful light, over the horizon into our eyes[Chorus]
It could be love
And we could be homies
Once you get to know me
I could be your one and only
I could make you Unlonely
Or we could take it slowly
And we could keep it low key
I could be your one and only
I could make you Unlonely

[Verse 1]
I've been chasing summer around
Searching for the sunshine
Looking for a good time
Following the good vibes
Listening to intuition as it's happening
Diggin' into life cuz at times it can be saddening
Yea it can be a grey day, if you're lonely
A little rain suddenly turns heavy
But a whole lotta love can make the clouds go away
Maybe the time for us is now

[Pre-Chorus]
When the table's set for two
And there's nobody with you
Seeing movies by yourself
Let me be your someone else

[Chorus]
It could be love
And we could be homies
Once you get to know me
I could be your one and only
I could make you Unlonely
Or we could take it slowly
And we could keep it low key
I could be your one and only
I could make you Unlonely

[Hook]
Love, la-la-la, love
Love, la-la, love
One and only, I could make you Unlonely

[Verse 2]
I give you my word although I'm making words up
Unlonely ain't a word but I don't give a FRUCK
Cause I'm fresh from the farm where critics can't bother me
Living is tricky as it is so that ain't stopping me
You and me we both agree that no one needs the scrutiny
All we want is peace and love and honestly you ruined me
With your beautiful smile and your style continuity
I'd be a fool not to take the opportunity to say
Hey, we should be homies
I think we could be bigger than cheese and macaroni
We could keep it sweet like Chachi and Joanie
Or maybe just be ourselves: Never Phony
Never second guessing the freindship connection
Parallel living, never in possession
Of your individual personal expression
Together we're just a much better reflection of Love

[Chorus]
And we could be homies
Once you get to know me
I could be your one and only
I could make you Unlonely
Or we could take it slowly
And we could keep it low key
I could be your one and only
I could make you Unlonely

[Hook]
Love, la-la-la, love
Love, la-la, love
One and only, I could make you Unlonely
Love, la-la-la, love
Love, la-la, love
One and only, I could make you Unlonely

[Bridge]
When the table's set for two
And there's nobody with you
Seeing movies by yourself
Let me be your someone else
If you're spending time alone
If it's just you and your phone
Taking pictures of yourself
Baby, maybe I can help

[Chorus]
It could be love
And we could be homies
Once you get to know me
I could be your one and only
I could make you Unlonely
Or we could take it slowly
And we could keep it low key
I could be your one and only
I could make you Unlonely

[Hook]
Love, la-la-la, love
Love, la-la, love
One and only, I could make you unlonely

It could be love
And we could be homies (Love, la-la-la, love)
And once you get to know me (Love, la-la, love)
I could be your one and only
I could make you Unlonely[Verse 1: Jason Mraz]
It feels like we've been friends forever, yeah
And we always see eye to eye
The more time we spend together
The more I wanna say what's on my mind

[Pre-Chorus: Jason Mraz]
Take it easy
'Cause it ain't easy to say

[Chorus: Jason Mraz]
I wanna be more than friends
I wanna be more than friends
I wanna tell everyone you're taken
And take your hand until the end
I wanna be more than friends

[Verse 2: Meghan Trainor]
At the risk of sounding foolish
I don't wanna fool around no more
If we're gonna do this then let's do this
You can fix my broken heart if it's all yours

[Pre-Chorus: Meghan Trainor & Jason Mraz]
So take it easy
'Cause it ain't easy to say

[Chorus: Meghan Trainor]
I wanna be more than friends
I wanna be more than friends
I wanna tell everyone you're taken
And take your hand until the end
I wanna be more than friends

[Post-Chorus: Meghan Trainor & Jason Mraz]
I'm asking you to be my baby
I'm giving you my heart, don't break it
I'm crushing and I'm going crazy
Either way I know we'll make it

[Bridge: Jason Mraz & Meghan Trainor, Both]
Take it easy
It ain't easy to say
I'll take it easy
I'll take it easy
It ain't easy to say

[Chorus: Jason Mraz & Meghan Trainor]
I wanna be more than friends
I wanna be more than friends
I wanna tell everyone you're taken
And take your hand until the end
I wanna be more than friends (Friends)
I'm asking you to be my baby (Asking you to be my baby)
I'm giving you my heart, don't break it (Giving you my heart, don't break it)
I'm crushing and I'm going crazy (Hey)
Either way I know we'll make it (I know, I know, I know we'll make it)[Verse 1]
Was it you who spoke the words that things would happen but not to me
Oh, things are gonna happen naturally
Oh, taking your advice and I'm looking on the bright side
And balancing the whole thing
Oh, but often times those words get tangled up in lines
And the bright lights turn to night
Oh, until the dawn it brings
Another day to sing about the magic that was you and me

[Chorus]
'Cause you and I both loved
What you and I spoke of
And others just read of
Others only read of the love, the love that I love, yeah
(Da da da da)

[Verse 2]
See, I'm all about them words
Over numbers, unencumbered numbered words
Hundreds of pages, pages, pages for words
More words than I had ever heard and I feel so alive

[Chorus]
'Cause you and I both loved
What you and I spoke of
And others just read of
And if you could see me now
Oh, love, love
You and I, you and I
Not so little, you and I, anymore, mmm

[Verse 3]
And with this silence brings a moral story
More importantly evolving is the glory of a boy

[Chorus]
'Cause you and I both loved
What you and I spoke of
And others just read of
And if you could see me now
Well, I'm almost finally out of
I'm finally out of
Finally de de de de de
Well I'm almost finally, finally
Well, I'm free, oh, I'm free

[Bridge]
And it's okay if you have to go away
Oh, just remember the telephone works both ways
But if I never ever hear them ring
If nothing else, I'll think the bells inside
Have finally found you someone else and that's okay
'Cause I'll remember everything you sang

[Chorus]
'Cause you and I both loved
What you and I spoke of
And others just read of
And if you could see me now
Well, then I'm almost finally out of
I'm finally out of, finally de de de de de de
Well, I'm almost finally, finally, out of words[Verse - Jason Mraz]
I'm taking a moment just imaginin' that I'm dancin' with you
I'm your pole and all you're wearing is your shoes
You got soul, you know what to do to turn me on until I write a song about you
And you have your own engaging style
And you've got the knack to vivify
And you make my slacks a little tight, you may unfasten them if you like
That's if you crash and spend the night

[Verse - Jason Mraz ]
But you don't fold, you don't fade
You've got everything you need, especially me
Sister you've got it all
You make the call to make my day
In your message say my name
Your talk is all the talk, sister you've got it all

[Verse - Jason Mraz]
Curl your upper lip up and let me look around
Ride your tongue along your bottom lip and bite down
And bend your back and ask those hips if I can touch
Because they're the perfect jumping off point of getting closer to your

[Verse - Jason Mraz]
Butterfly
Well you float on by
Oh kiss me with your eyelashes tonight
Or Eskimo your nose real close to mine
And let's mood the lights and finally make it right
But you don't fold, you don't fade, you've got everything you need
Especially me
Sister you've got it all

[Verse - Jason Mraz]
You make the call to make my day
In your message say my name
Your talk is all the talk sister you've got it all
You've got it all, you've got it all, you've got it all [2x]

You've got it all, you've got it all

[Bridge - Jason Mraz]
Doll I need to see you pull your knee socks up
Let me feel you up side, down slide, in slide, out slide, over here
Climb into my mouth now child

[Verse - Jason Mraz]
Butterfly, well you landed on my mind
Damn right you landed on my ear and then you crawled inside
Now I see you perfectly behind closed eyes
I wanna fly with you and I don't wanna lie to you
Cause I, cause I can't recall a better days
Sun coming to shine on the occasion

[Verse - Jason Mraz]
You're an open-minded lady
You've got it all
And I never forget a face
If I'm making my own
I have my days
Let's face the fact here, it's you who's got it all

[Verse - Jason Mraz]
You know that fortune favors the brave
Well let me get paid while I make you breakfast
The rest is up to you, you make the call

You make the call to make my day
In your message say my name
Your talk is all the talk, sister you've got it all

[Verse - Jason Mraz]
Cause I can't recall a better day
Sun coming to shine on the occasion
You're a sophisticated lady, oh you've got it all

[Bridge - Jason Mraz]
You've got it all, you've got it all, you've got it all [3x]
You've got it all, you've got it all:

[Outro - Jason Mraz]
Butterfly, baby, well you've got it all[Verse 1]
You've got the best of both worlds
You're the kind of girl who can take down a man
And lift him back up again
You are strong but you're needy
Humble but you're greedy
And based on your body language
And shoddy cursive I've been reading
Your style is quite selective
Though your mind is rather reckless
Well I guess it just suggests
That this is just what happiness is

[Chorus]
Hey, what a beautiful mess this is
It's like picking up trash in dresses

[Verse 2]
Well it kind of hurts when the kind of words you write
Kind of turn themselves into knives
And don't mind my nerve you could call it fiction
But I like being submerged in your contradictions, dear
Cause here we are, here we are

[Verse 3]
Although you are biased I love your advice
Your comebacks  they're quick
And probably have to do with your insecurities
There's no shame in being crazy
Depending on how you take these
Words i'm paraphrasing this relationship we're staging

[Chorus]
Hey, what a beautiful mess this is
It's like picking up trash in dresses

[Verse 4]
Well it kind of hurts when the kind of words you say
Kind of turn themselves into blades
And "kind and courteous" is a life I've heard
But it's nice to say that we played in the dirt
Cause here, here we are, here we are
Here we are
Here we are
Here we are
Here we are
Here we are
Here we are
Here we are

We're still here
What a beautiful mess this is
It's like taking a guess when the only answer is "Yes"

[Verse 5]
Through timeless words and priceless pictures
We'll fly like birds not of this earth

And tides  they turn  and hearts disfigure
But that's no concern when we're wounded together

[Outro]
And we tore our dresses and stained our shirts
But it's nice today. Oh, the wait was so worth it[Hook] [x2]
You fucking did it
You really did it yeah
You really did it
You really did it

[Verse 1]:
All those who are hanging round the water cooler
Will never believe how you tackled the thousand puzzle pieces
And you could see it before we completed it
Before we made it whole
How you put it all together with a blindfold
You're like a long game token that keeps the game going
But your claim to fame is how you like to lay low
Out of the lime light
Which can hurt your eyes
If you're not careful you'll become another devil in disguise
But you watch your back
You watch your back
You're growing eyes in the back of your head
To prevent another sneak attack
Sneak attack
You must be keeping secret weapons in your fanny pack
You're like my laughing gas, you got the cat to dance
You're like Lance on a mountain in the Tour de France
You got a wing span spanning the globe
You got gold
And you're teaching us to let go
You're a wise old owl when you're the cats meow
If this were twelfth grade you would be my cap and gown
If this were India then you would be a sacred cow
And I'd bow down to you
So grateful to the Gods for making you

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
You'll be standing up for equal rights of the American people
And you'll be meeting all the influential seekers with a similar dream
You've got a front seat saved that's emblazoned with your name
And a super hero cape on
You see the future as a sky full of possibility
With a spryness of mind and a psychic ability
You probably won't die at the hands of an enemy
And not in a den of inequity
You're not the average Joe, you're not the average Jane
You're not above or below, but you're never just plain
You never take no, personally
And any time you get stopped you try another way
Could we settle for a kiss without a cease and desist
If they ask we won't tell because we're activists
I am that I am and you are that you are
And we're all that is
How p-e-r-f-e-c-t your a-t-t-i-t-u-d-e be

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
When you circumnavigating the turntable call and attracts
Like you be jumping in the water you be making a splash
You be keeping your heart beat going
And you be keeping the harmony going
Well there's an awful lot of musical styles you could play
Well there's an awful lot of tastes
An awful lot of dates you could be on
You be keeping your back bone strong
And you be keeping the trombone blowing
Well every friend of mine will give each other high-fives
When your beautiful mind is to your own devices
You do what you like and you always like what you try
You touch me like an iPhone application
Move me like a smooth jazz music station
Do what you do in the way that you choose to do them
Oh my God
You're quick to be so quotable, damn you got a way with words
You got a magical handshake for saving the earth
You are a generous man
You are so awesome it hurts

You are a-w-e-s-o-m-e

[Hook]

[Outro]
You are a-w-e-s-o-m-e
You are a-w-e-s-o-m-e
You are a-w-e-s-o-m-e
You are a-w-e-s-o-m-e
You are a-w-e-s-o-

Saved message:
Hey, whats upUh, I just lost it, at the end of the day I fucking lost it, I just blew up. My whole entire fucking apartment building. I told everyone to go fuck themselves. I just had a hard time today and uh, I dont know

[Verse 1: Jason Mraz]
Calm down
Deep breaths
And get yourself dressed instead
Of running around
And pulling on your threads
And breaking yourself up

[Bridge]
If it's a broken part, replace it
If it's a broken arm, then brace it
If it's a broken heart, then face it

[Chorus]

Hold your own
Know your name
And go your own way

And everything will be fine

[Verse 2]
Hang on
Help is on the way
And stay strong
I'm doing everything

[Chorus]
And hold your own
Know your name
And go your own way
Hold your own
Know your name
And go your own way
And everything, everything will be fine
Everything

[Verse 3]
Are the details in the fabric
Are the things that make you panic
Are your thoughts results of static cling?
Are the things that make you blow
Hell, no reason, go on and scream
If you're shocked it's just the fault
Of faulty manufacturing

[Bridge]
Everything will be fine
Everything in no time at all
Everything

[Chorus]
And hold your own
Know your name
And go your own way
Hold your own
Know your name
Go your own way

[Verse 4]
(Hold your own) Are the details in the fabric (know your name)
Are the things that make you panic
(Go your own way)Are your thoughts results of static cling?
Are the details in the fabric (Hold your own, know your name)
Are the things that make you panic (Go your own way)
Is it Mother Nature's sewing machine?
Are the things that make you blow (Hold your own, know your name)
Hell no reason go on and scream
If you're shocked it's just the fault (Go your own way)
Of faulty manufacturing
Everything will be fine
Everything in no time at all
Hearts will hold

[Spoken outro: James Morrison]
New message:
Yo, whats up man? I, uh, I dont know, I just wanted to say that, uh, everythings cool with me now. I mean, I just think, I think Ill always be funky, cant stop being funky, but I guess we just deal with it how it comes, deal with the humps, take the jumps. I feel like youre an island of reality in an ocean of diarrhea. And I love you buddy. Ok. Bye[Verse 1]
Well, I saw fireworks from the freeway
And behind closed eyes, I cannot make them go away
'Cause you were born on the fourth of July, freedom ring
Well, something on the surface, it stings
I said, something on the surface, well, it kinda makes me nervous who says that you deserve this?
And what kind of god would serve this?
We will cure this dirty old disease
Well, if you've gots the poison, I've gots the remedy

[Pre-Chorus]
The remedy is the experience
This is a dangerous liaison
I says, the comedy is that it's serious
Which is a strange enough new play on words
I say the tragedy is how you're gonna spend
The rest of your nights with the light on
So shine the light on all of your friends
When it all amounts to nothing in the end

[Chorus]
I, I won't worry my life away
Hey, oh, oh
I, I won't worry my life away
Hey, oh, oh

[Verse 2]
Well, I heard two men talking on the radio
In a cross fire kind of new reality show
Uncovering the ways to plan the next big attack
While they were counting down the days to stab the brother in the be right back after this
The unavoidable kiss, where the minty fresh death breath is sure to outlast his catastrophe
Dance with me, because if you've gots the poison, I've gots the remedy

[Pre-Chorus]
The remedy is the experience
This is a dangerous liaison
I says the comedy is that it's serious
Which is a strange enough new play on words
I say the tragedy is how you're gonna spend
The rest of your nights with the light on
So shine the light on all of your friends
When it all amounts to nothing in the end

[Chorus]
I, I won't worry my life away
Hey, oh, oh
I (I won't, I won't, I won't)
I won't worry my life away
Hey, oh, oh

[Bridge]
When I fall in love (I fall in love), I take my time
There's no need to hurry when I'm making up my mind
You can turn off the sun (Turn off the sun), but I'm still gonna shine and I'll tell you why

[Pre-Chorus]
Because the remedy is the experience
This is a dangerous liaison
I says the comedy is that it's serious
Which is a strange enough new play on words
I say the tragedy is how you're gonna spend
The rest of your nights with the light on
So shine the light on all of your friends
When it all amounts to nothing in the end

[Chorus]
I ('Cause I won't)
I won't worry my life away
Hey, oh, oh
I (I won't, I won't, I won't)
I won't worry my life away
(I won't worry my life)
I (I won't)
I won't worry my life away
I ('Cause I won't, and I won't, and I won't)
Worry my life away
Hey, oh, oh
I (I won't, I won't, I won't)
I won't worry my life away[Jah Cure]
Cure AGAIN!
HEY PRINCESS
Yeah
Yeah you
Give you more again Yeay

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
Knew I would love you like a fat kid love food
Knew I would score like Shaq did in school
Knew I was stupid, Knew I looked like a big fool
I must of had the flu, I thought the shit was cool
Knew you would fall in love with me and the shit I do
But never knew you would murder me, what did I do
Knew you was right for me, knew I was right for you
Knew I would help you sell, knew I would write for you

[Verse 2: Jason Mraz]
Well you done done me and you bet I felt it
I tried to be chill but you're so hot that I melted
I fell right through the cracks
Now I'm trying to get back
Before the cool done run out
I'll be giving it my bestest
And nothing's going to stop me but divine intervention
I reckon it's again my turn to win some or learn some

[Hook: Jason Mraz]
I won't hesitate no more, no more
It cannot wait, I'm yours

[Interlude: Jah Cure]
I dont need no time and I dont need no reason
Im yours whenever whenever whenever ill be there
Til every season
Without you in my life
There would be no meaning
Baby im yours forever
Seasons come seasons go
Love you so much baby I don't know
I love you I love you I love you
Yeahhhhhhh

[Hook: Jason Mraz]
So I won't hesitate no more, no more
It cannot wait I'm sure
There's no need to complicate
Our time is short
This is our fate, I'm yours

[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]
Knew I would keep you well, knew I would fight for you
Knew I would pull out my heart and bring it right to you
You knew all about me baby, but you wasn't about me baby
Young Wayne, prepare for change
Because it seem like girly don't care the same
You had my chain, you buried my name, then we had champagne

[Verse 4: Jason Mraz]
I've been spending way too long checking my tongue in the mirror
And bending over backwards just to try to see it clearer
But my breath fogged up the glass
And so I drew a face and laughed
I guess what I'm be saying is there ain't no better reason
To rid yourself of vanity and just go with the seasons
It's what we aim to do
Our name is our virtue

[Hook: Jason Mraz]
I won't hesitate no more, no more
It cannot wait I'm sure[Verse 1]
Let's drive out to the desert at midnight
To dance in the dust of our headlights
And score some good seats for the sunrise
And dress up in clothes we dont mind getting messed up
Where no one will know how to get us
We dont need a map we'll just drive, drive, drive

[Chorus]
I wanna get lost with you
And hide out out under the light of the moon
I wanna get lost with you
And see what it's like
To spend the whole night with you, just you
You, just you

[Verse 2]
We can head north over the oceans of turquoise
Where after awhile there'll be no noise
Except for the sound of our heartbeats beating on
And we'll stand in a canyon alone
Singing our favorite songs
And wait for the words to return
In the echo echo echo echo echo echo

[Chorus]
I wanna get lost with you
And hide out out under the light of the moon
I wanna get lost with you
And see what it's like to spend the whole night with you, just you
With you, just you
With you, just you
With you, just you

And I wanna get lost

[Outro]
Let's see what the night can do
Let's see what the night can do
Let's see what the night can do
I wanna get lost

Let's see what the night can do
Let's see what the night can do
Let's see what the night can do
I wanna get lost

Let's see what the night can do
Let's see what the night can do
Let's see what the night can do
I wanna get lost with you

I wanna get lost with you
Let's see what the night can do
I wanna get lost with you
Let's see what our hearts wanna do

I wanna know what it's like
To spend the whole night with you, just you
With you, just you
With you, just you[Intro]
Yo, brother A to Z
Yo, whassup B?
Yo, what time is it?
Haha
It's laundry day

[Verse 1]
Well, let the geek in the pink take a stab at it
If you like the way I'm thinking', baby, wink at it
I may be skinny at times, but I'm fat fulla rhymes
Pass me the mic and I'ma grab at it
Well, isn't it delicious? Crazy way that I'm kissin'
'Cause baby, listen to this, don't wanna miss it while it's hittin'
Sometimes you gotta fit in to get in
But don't ever quit 'cause soon I'm gonna let you in, but see

[Chorus]
I don't care what you might think about me
You'll get by without me if you want
Well, I could be the one to take you home
Baby, we could rock the night alone
If we never get down, it wouldn't be a let down
But sugar, don't forget what you already know
That I could be the one to turn you out
We could be the talk across the town
Don't judge it by the color, confuse it for another
You might regret what you let slip away
Like the geek in the pink
Like the geek in the pink, yeah
The geek in the pink

[Verse 2]
Well, this relationship fodder don't mean to bother nobody
But Cupid's automatic musta fired multiple shots at her
Because she fall in love too often, that's what's the matter
At least I'm talking about it, keep my pattern of flattery
And she was starin' through the doorframe
Eyeing me down like already a bad boyfriend
Well, she can get her toys outta the drawer then
'Cause I ain't comin' home I don't need that attention, see

[Chorus]
I don't care what she might think about me
She'll get by without me if she wants
But I could be the one to take her home
Baby, we could rock the night alone
If we never get down, it wouldn't be a let down
But sugar, don't forget what you already know
That I could be the one to turn you out
We could be the talk across the town
Don't judge it by the color, confuse it for another
You might regret what you let slip away

[Bridge]
Hey baby, look at me go
From zero to hero
You better take it from a geek like me
Well, I can save you from unoriginal dum-dums
Who wouldn't care if you complete them or not?

[Verse 3]
So what? I've got a short attention span
A coke in my hand
'Cause I'd rather have the afternoon, relax and understand
My hip hop and flip-flops, it don't stop with the light rock
My shot to mock, you kinda puts me in a tight spot
The hype is nothing more than hoo-ha
So I'm developing a language and I'm callin' it my own
So take a peek into the speaker and you'll see what I mean
That on the other side the grass is greener

[Chorus]
I don't care what you might think about me
You'll get by without me if you want
I could be the one to take you home
Baby, we could rock the night alone
If we never get down, it wouldn't be a let down
But sugar, don't forget what you already know
That I could be the one to turn you out
We could be the talk across the town
Don't judge it by the color, confuse it for another
You might regret what you let slip away
Like the geek in the pink

[Outro]
Well, I'm the geek in the pink, yo
Geek is the color for fall, I'm the geek in the pink
So I'm the geek yo, in the pink yo
Hahah, y'all geek is the color for fall
I'm the geek in the pink[Verse 1]
I can't stop thinking about you
And dreaming of your smile
I can't stop reading into you
Love, oh yeah, you're the best book I've read in awhile
I don't just read you for the articles
I read you 'til my heart is full
You keep my heart a-beating
You're keeping me from sleeping
The only one I'm cheating is me if I don't take control

[Chorus]
We got nothing to lose, might as well hold hands
We're already fools so we might as well dance

Put your loving arms around me once more
And we'll go crashing into folks on the dance floor
You can walk all over my shoes if you want to

We got nothing to lose, might as well take off our pants
Yeah, we're already fools so we might as well dance

[Verse 2]
Soon the song will be over
We'll have to say goodnight
Don't you want some closure
Before you turn out the light
Honey, think of your heart
Yeah, the heart's too heavy to slow
Partly 'cause it's running the show
Partly 'cause the beat is connected to the feet
And I've got the sweetest crush on you
Baby, let's go

[Chorus]
We've got nothing to lose, might as well hold hands
Yeah, we're already fools so we might as well dance
We've got nothing prove, might as well take off our pants
Yeah, we're already fools so we might as well dance
Yeah, we're already fools so we might as well dance[Verse 1]
Wake up everyone
How can you sleep at a time like this
Unless the dreamer is the real you
Listen to your voice
The one that tells you to taste past the tip of your tongue
Leap and the net will appear

[Chorus]
I don't wanna wake before
The dream is over
I'm gonna make it mine
Yes I, I'll own it
I'm gonna make it mine
Yes I'll make it all mine

[Verse 2]
I keep my life on a heavy rotation
Requesting that it's lifting you up
Up up and away
And over to a table at the Gratitude Caf

[Bridge]
And I am finally there
And all the angels they'll be singing
Ah la la la ah la la la I la la la la love you

[Chorus]
I don't wanna wake before
The dream is over
I'm gonna make it mine
Yes I, I'll own it
I'm gonna make it mine
Yes I'll make it all mine

[Verse 3]
And timing's everything
And this time there's plenty
I am balancing
Careful and steady
And reveling in energy that everyone's emitting

[Chorus]
Well I dont wanna wait, no more
Oh I wanna celebrate the whole world
Im gonna make it mine
Oh, yes I following your joy
Im gonna make it mine
Because I, I am open
Im gonna make it mine
Thats why, I will show it
Im gonna make it, all mine
Gonna make, gonna make, gonna make, gonna make, make it, make it, make it, make it mine
Oh my, yes Ill make it all mine[Verse 1]
The question is why, why are we here?
To say our hellos and goodbyes, then disappear
This beautiful life, what is it for?
To learn how to master peace or master war?

[Chorus]
There's only one answer that matters
Even if your heart has been shattered
Whatever you want, whatever you are after
Love is still the answer
Love is still the answer

[Post-Chorus]
Love, love, love, love
Love, love, love, love

[Verse 2]
We all make mistakes, no, we're not perfect yet
Maybe God made us all from an accident
And the question that sits on everyone's lips
Is why should we pick ourselves up and start over again?

[Chorus]
There's only one answer that matters
Even if your heart has been shattered
Whatever you want, whatever you are after
Love is still the answer
Love is still the answer

[Post-Chorus]
Love, love, love, love
Love, love, love

[Bridge]
The question I'll ask at the end of my days
Is what did I give and what will I take?

[Chorus]
There's only one (there's only one) answer that matters (answer that matters)
Even if your heart and your dreams have been shattered
Whatever you want, whatever you are after
Love is still the answer
Love is still the answer

[Post-Chorus]
Love, love, love, love
Love, love, love
Love, love, love, love
Love, love, love

[Outro]
Love is still the answer[Verse 1: Jason Mraz]
Ok go, go hang your heart on, any tree
You can make yourself available to anybody
Cause every living' person knows you are a prize
Whichever way you go I'll be easy to find
I don't ask for much, just be honest, with me
I don't ask for much

[Verse 2: Jason Mraz]
Think of this song as a promise, you can do what you want
If you decide you wanna move into a new stage
Deleting me from pages in your mission statement
My love is unconditional, make no mistake
I don't ask for much, just be honest, with me
I don't ask for much, just be honest, with me

[Chorus: Inara George]
Who we are, when love is what it wants to be
We are free, and we are, having the best day ever by far
Being treated to the life, like a superstar

[Verse 3: Jason Mraz]
I can hold space while you see what your heart has to say about me
I acknowledge you for what you do to keep strong
There's no dotted line to sign away your freedom
I'll always stand beside you, don't get me wrong
I don't ask for much, just be honest, with me

[Chorus: Inara George]
Who we are, when love is what it wants to be
We are free, and we are, having the best day ever by far
Being treated to the life, like a superstar

[Verse 4: Jason Mraz]
If I miscommunicated I apologies
If the picture that I painted wasn't very nice
My love is standing by you whatever you decide
I don't ask for much, just be honest, with me
I don't ask for much, just be honest, with me

[Outro: Jason Mraz]
Who we are, when love is what it wants to be
We are free, and we are having the best day ever by far
Yes we are[Verse 1]
It takes a crane to build a crane
It takes two floors to make a story
It takes an egg to make a hen
It takes a hen to make an egg
There is no end to what I'm saying
It takes a thought to make a word
And it takes some words to make an action
And t takes some work to make it work
It takes some good to make it hurt
It takes some bad for satisfaction

[Chorus]
La la la la la la la, life is wonderful
Ah la la la la la la, life goes full circle
Ah la la la la la la, life is wonderful
Ah la la la la

[Verse 2]
It takes a night to make it dawn
And it takes a day to make you yawn, brother
And it takes some old to make you young
It takes some cold to know the sun
It takes the one to have the other
And it takes no time to fall in love
But it takes you years to know what love is
And it takes some fears to make you trust
It takes those tears to make it rust
It takes the dust to have it polished, yeah

[Chorus]
Ah la la la la la la, life is wonderful
Ah la la la la la la, life goes full circle
Ah la la la la la la life is wonderful
Ah la la la
Life is so... (Life is so)

[Verse 3]
It takes some silence to make sound
It takes a loss before you found it
And it takes a road to go nowhere
It takes a toll to make you care
It takes a hole to make a mountain

[Chorus]
Ah la la la la la la, life is wonderful
Ah la la la la la la, life goes full circle
Ha la la la la la, life is wonderful
Ha la la la la la, life is meaningful
Ha la la la la la, life is wonderful
Ha la la la la la, life, it is so wonderful

[Outro]
It is so meaningful
It is so wonderful
It is meaningful
It is wonderful
It is meaningful
It goes full circle
Wonderful
Meaningful
Full circle
Wonderful[Verse 1]
Some dreams they turn out unfamiliar
Some days are riddled with regret
And even when you think it's over
You ain't seen nothin' yet

[Chorus]
No we can't hold out on love
No we can't hold out on love
Because it's up to us
To make sure there's enough
We can't hold out on love

[Verse 2]
Some nights it feels my bones are empty
Some things are too hard to explain
Sometimes I look at you with envy
And then I see we're both the same

[Chorus]
So we can't hold out on love
No we can't hold out on love
Because it's up to us
To make sure there's enough
We can't hold out on love
No we can't hold out on love

[Bridge]
All we want
All we need
Is inside you and me
We're all alike
All the while
Everybody breathes
All because
All the love
Echoes in the beating of our hearts
Let's get started

[Chorus]
You can't hold out on love
No we can't hold out on love (Let's get started)
Because it's up to us
To make sure there's enough
We can't hold out on love (Let's get started)

[Chorus]
No we can't hold out on love
No we can't hold out on love (You can't)
Because it's up to us
To make sure there's enough
We can't hold out on love
Oh we can't hold out on love

Cause it's up to us
To make sure there's enough
We can't hold out on love[Verse 1]
There are three things I do when my life falls apart
Number one: I cry my eyes out and dry up my heart
Not until I do this will my new life start
So thats the first thing that I do when my life falls apart

[Verse 2]
Well the second thing I do is I close both of my eyes
And sing my thank yous to each and every moment of my life
I go where I know the love is and let it fill me up inside
Gathering new strength from sorrow
Im glad to be alive

[Chorus]
And things are looking up
I know above the clouds the sun is shining
Things are looking up
Love is still the answer I'm relying on
Three little things
Things are looking up

[Verse 3]
Well the third thing that I do now when my world caves in
Is I pause, I take a breath and bow
And I let the chapter end
I design my future bright
Not by when my life has been
And I try try try try, try again
Yes I try try try try, try again

[Chorus]
Things are looking up
I know beyond the dark the sun is rising
Things are looking up
And I know above the clouds the sun is shining
Things are looking up
Uh, love is still the answer I'm relying on
Three little things
Three little things[Verse 1]
I try to picture the girl
Through a looking glass
And see her as a carbon atom
See her eyes and stare back at them
See that girl
As her own new world
Though a home is on the surface, she is still a universe

[Bridge]
Glory God, oh God is peeking through the blinds
Are we all here standing naked
Taking guesses at the actual date and time
Oh my, justifying reasons why
Is an absolutely insane resolution to live by

[Chorus]
Live high
Live mighty
Live righteously
Taking it easy
Live high, live mighty
Live righteously

[Verse 3]
Try to picture the man
To always have an open hand
And see him as a giving tree
See him as matter
Matter fact he's not a beast
No not the devil either
Always a good deed doer
And it's laughter that we're making after all

[Bridge]
The call of the wild is still an ordination, why?
And the order of the primates
All our politics are too late
Oh my, the congregation in my mind
Is this assembly singing of gratitude
Practicing their loving for you

[Chorus]
Live high
Live mighty
Live righteously
Taking it easy
Live high, live mighty
Live righteously

[Verse 5]
Just take it easy
And celebrate the malleable reality
You see, nothing is ever as it seems
This life is but a dream

[Outro]
Live high, live high
Live mighty, mighty, mighty
Oh, live righteously
Taking it easy, live high
Live mighty, oh, live righteously
Just take, just, just taking easy high
Oh, live mighty, mighty
Oh, live righteously
Oh, just take it easy
Just live high
Oh, live righteously
Just take it easy[Verse 1]
I pack my bags, I'm going away
I'm only leaving for a day
It's nice to have some time alone
And it's nice to know how I miss home
I wrote this song to let you know

[Chorus]
I'm better with you
I'm better with you
I'm better because you give meaning to the words "I love you"
I'm better with you
I'm better with you
I'm better because you are who I love to say those words to

[Verse 2]
You're always with me in my head
I take you with me in my heart
It's better when I'm in your bed
It's better when we're not apart
I just can't do this alone

[Chorus]
I'm better with you
I'm better with you
I'm better because you give meaning to the words "I love you"
I'm better with you
I'm better with you
I'm better because you are who I love to say those words to

[Bridge]
Yeah, life's about the people who surround you
Love's the only thing it all comes down to
I just want you to know

[Chorus]
I'm better with you
I'm better with you
I'm better with you
I'm better with you
I'm better because you give meaning to the words "I love you"
I'm better with you
I'm better because you are who I love to say those words to
You-hoo-you-hoo-hoo-hoo[Verse 1]
And I
I'm dreaming of sleeping next to you and feeling like a lost little boy in a brand new town
I'm counting my sheep and each one that passes is another dream to ashes
And they all fall down
And I lay me down tonight
I close my eyes
What a beautiful sight

[Chorus]
Sleeping to dream about you
And I'm so damn tired
Of having to live without you
But I don't mind
Sleeping to dream about you and I'm so tired

[Verse 2]
I found myself in the riches
Your eyes, your lips, your hair well you were everywhere out there
But I woke up in the ditches, I hit the light and I thought you might be here
But you were nowhere (you were nowhere)
Well You were nowhere
And as I lay me back to sleep
Lord I pray that I can keep

[Chorus]
Sleeping to dream about you
And I'm so damn tired
Of having to live without you
But I don't mind
Sleeping to dream about you and I'm so tired

[Verse 3]
It's just a little a lullaby to keep myself from crying myself to sleep at night
Oh just a lullabye to keep from crying myself to sleep
Oh just a, just oh, just a little lullabye

[Verse 4]
Sleeping to dream about you
And I'm so tired
Of having to live without you
And I'm so tired

[Chorus]
Sleeping to dream about you
And I'm so damn tired
Of having to live without you
But I don't mind
Sleeping to dream about you and I'm so tired

[Outro]
Well I'm so, I'm tired
I'm falling, I'm so tired, I'm so tired[Verse 1]
Maybe I annoy you with my choices
Well, you annoy me sometimes too with your voice
But that ain't enough for me
To move out and move on
I'm just gonna love you like the woman I love

[Verse 2]
We don't have to hurry
You can take as long as you want
I'm holding' steady
My heart's at home
With my hand behind you
I will catch you if you fall
Yeah I'm gonna love you like the woman I love

[Verse 3]
Sometimes the world can make you feel
You're not welcome anymore
And you beat yourself up
You let yourself get mad
And in those times when you stop loving'
That woman I adore
You can relax
Because, babe, I got your back
Uh, I got you
Uh, Yeah
I don't wish to change you
You've got it under control
You wake up each day different
Another reason for me to keep holding' on
I'm not attached to any way you're showing up
I'm just gonna love you like the woman I love
Yeah I'm gonna love you
Oh, Yeah I'm gonna love you
Cause you're the woman I love[Verse 1]
Love is where this begins
Thank you for letting me in
I never had to pretend
You've always known who I am

[Pre-Chorus]
And I know my life is better
Because you're a part of it
I know without you by my side that I would be different

[Chorus]
Thank you for all of your trust
Thank you for not giving up
Thank you for holding my hand
I've always known where you stand
Cause I feel my life is better
So is the world we're living in
I'm thankful for the time I've spent with my best friend

You're my best friend

[Verse 2]
Thank you for calling me out
Thank you for waking me up
Thank you for breaking it down
Thank you for choosing us
Thank you for all you're about
Thank you for lifting me up
Thank you for keeping me grounded and being here

[Chorus]
Now my life is better
Because you're a part of it
Cause I know without you by my side that I would be different
Yes I feel my life is better
So is the world we're living in
I'm thankful for the time I've spent with my best friend

You're my best friendLove is a funny thing
Whenever I give it  it comes back to me
And it's wonderful to be giving with my whole heart
As my heart receives your love

Oh, ain't it nice this tonight we got each other
And I am right beside you
More than just a partner or a lover
I'm your friend

When you love someone
Your heartbeat beats so loud
When you love someone
Your feet can't feel the ground
Shining stars all seem to congregate around your face
When you love someone
It comes back to you

And love is a funny thing
It's making my blood flow with energy
And it's like an awakened dream
Oh what I've been wishing for is happening
And it's right on time

Oh, ain't it nice this life we got each other
I am right beside you
More than just a partner or a lover
I'm your friend

When you love someone
Your heartbeat beats so loud
When you love someone
Your feet can't feel the ground
Shining stars all seem to congregate around your face
When you love someone

When you love someone

I gonna give myself to love tonight
I'll lift you up to touch the starlight
And we will savor every second we
Spend together you and I will
You and I will
You and I will

When you love someone
Your heartbeat beats so loud
When you love someone
Your feet can't feel the ground
Shining stars all seem to congregate
Around your face when you love someone
It comes back to you[Verse 1]
If I stayed here, would you follow
Could we put time in a bottle
And forget all of our to-do's
Pretend we checked in to a chateau
In a world with no tomorrows
Just time for me and you

[Pre-Chorus]
Do you wanna go
Anywhere, baby

[Chorus]
I've got no plans for us today
Got no plans to get away
I've got no plans, except for loving you
I've got no plans for us tonight
So baby, hold me tight
I've got no plans, except for loving you

[Verse 2]
If we dream it we can be it
I'm putting all my feelings
Into spending time with you
I could sit right here all evening
Just listening to you breathing
And taking in the view

[Pre-Chorus]
Do you wanna go
Anywhere, baby

[Chorus]
I've got no plans for us today
Got no plans to get away
I've got no plans, except for loving you
I've got no plans for us tonight
So baby, hold me tight
I've got no plans, except for loving you[Verse 1]
I've got the dynamo of volition
The puh-pole position
Automatic transmission with luh-ow emissions
I'm a brand new addition to the old edition
With the love unconditional
And I'm a drama abolitionist
Damn no opposition, to my proposition
Half of a man, half magician
Half a politician, holding the mic like ammunition
And my vision is as simple as light
Ain't no reason we should be in a fight, no demolition
Get to vote, get to say what you like, procreation
Compositions already written by themselves
Heck is for the people not believing in gosh

[Chorus]
Good Job, get 'em up way high
Gimme gimme that high five
Good time, get 'em way down low
Gimme gimme that low do
Good God, bring 'em back again
Gimme gimme that high ten
You're the best definition of good intentions
Oh oh
I do not answer the call if
I do not know who is calling
I guess the whole point of it all is
That we never know really

[Verse 2]
I'm trying to keep with the Joneses
While waiting for guns and the roses
To finish what we all suppose is
Gonna be the shit, so silly
Oh, fist like bumping and wrist lock
Twisting up a rizla
Kid Icarus on the transister
Nintendo be giving me the blister
I bend over take it in the kisser
My best friends are hitting on my sister
Try to tell them that they still a wish-a
Cuz she already got herself a mister
And besides that's gross to want to diss her
Dee-didee-dee-di-didn't I say, didn't I say

[Chorus]
Good Job, get 'em up way high
Gimme gimme that high five
Good time, get 'em way down low
Gimme gimme that low do
Good God, bring 'em back again
Gimme gimme that high ten
You're the best definition of good versus evil
Oh oh

[Verse 3]
I do not keep up with statistics
I do not sleep without a mistress
I do not eat unless it's fixed with
Some kind of sweet like a licorice
My home is deep inside the mystics
I'm known to keep digging on existence
I'm holding in the heat like a fishstick
My phone it beeps because I missed it

[Bridge]
I do not answer the call if
I do not know who is calling
I'm making no sense of it all
Say can I get a witness

[Verse 4]
I'm only a boy in a story
Just a hallucinatory
Tripping on nothing there is
Living in the wilderness
With a tiger spot on my back
Living life of a cat
I just wanna relax here
And write another rap tune
Driving off on your blind man's bike
You can say just what you like
Oh nothing can stop you, oh

[Chorus]
Good Job, get 'em up way high
Gimme gimme that high five
Good time, get 'em way down low
Gimme gimme that low do
Good God, bring 'em back again
Gimme gimme that high ten
You're the best, the best, the best
The best, the best, the best
The best
Good Job, get 'em up way high
Gimme gimme that high five
Good time, get 'em way down low
Gimme gimme that low do
Good God, bring 'em back again
Gimme gimme that high ten
You're the best definition of good intentions
You're the best definition of good intentions
You're the best definition of good intentions
You're the best around[Verse 1]
If this life is one act
Why do we lay all these traps
We put them right in our path
When we just wanna be free

[Verse 2]
I will not waste my days
Making up all kinds of ways
To worry about some things
That will not happen to me

So I just let go of what I know I don't know
And I know I'll only do this by

[Chorus]
Living in the moment
Living my life
Easy and breezy
With peace in my mind
With peace in my heart
Peace in my soul
Wherever I'm going, I'm already home
I'm Living in the moment

[Verse 3]
I'm letting myself off the hook for things I've done
I let my past go past
And now I'm having more fun
I'm letting go of the thoughts
That do not make me strong
And I believe this way can be the same for everyone

And if I fall asleep
I know you'll be the one who'll always remind me

[Chorus]
Living in the moment
Living my life
Easy and breezy
With peace in my mind
With peace in my heart
Peace in my soul
Wherever I'm going, I'm already home
I'm Living in the moment

[Verse 4]
I can't walk through life facing backwards
I have tried
I tried more than once to just make sure
And I was denied the future I'd been searching for
I spun around and hurt no more

[Chorus]
Living in the moment
Living my life
Easy and breezy
With peace in my mind
With peace in my heart
Peace in my soul
Wherever I'm going, I'm already home
I'm Living in the moment

[Chorus]
Living in the moment
Living my life
Easy and breezy
With peace in my mind
With peace in my heart
Peace in my soul
Wherever I'm going, I'm already home
I'm Living in the moment

[Chorus]
Living in the moment
Living my life
Easy and breezy
With peace in my mind
With peace in my heart
Peace in my soul
Wherever I'm going, I'm already home
I'm Living in the moment[Verse 1]
Hello, tell me you know
Yeah, you figured me out
Something gave it away
It would be such a beautiful moment
To see the look on your face
To know that I know that you know now

[Verse 2]
And baby that's a case of my wishful thinking
You know nothing
Well you and I
Why, we go carrying on for hours on end
We get along much better
Than you and your boyfriend

[Chorus]
Well all I really wanna do is love you
A kind much closer than friends use
But I still can't say it after all we've been through
And all I really want from you is to feel me
As the feeling inside keeps building
And I will find a way to you if it kills me
If it kills me

[Verse 3]
How long, can I go on like this
Wishing to kiss you
Before I rightly explode?
This double life I lead isn't healthy for me
In fact it makes me nervous
If I get caught I could be risking it all

Cause maybe there's a lot that I miss
In case I'm wrong

[Chorus]

[Verse 4]
If I should be so bold
I'd ask you to hold my heart in your hand
I'd tell you from the start how I've longed to be your man
But I never said a word
I guess I'm gonna miss my chance again

[Verse 4]
All I really wanna do is love you
A kind much closer than friends use
But I still can't say it after all we've been through
And all I really want from you is to feel me
As the feeling inside keeps building
And I will find a way to you if it kills me
If it kills me
If it kills me
I think it might kill me

[Verse 6]
And all I really want from you is to feel me
Yeah, the feeling inside keeps building
I'll find a way to you if it kills me
If it kills me
It might kill me[Verse 1]
There's a picture on my kitchen wall
Looks like Jesus and his friends involved
There's a party getting started in the yard
There's a couple getting steamy in the car parked in the drive
Was I too young to see this with my eyes?

[Verse 2]
By the pool last night, apparently
The chemicals weren't mixed properly
You hit your head and then forgot your name
And then you woke up at the bottom by the drain
And now your altitude and memory's a shame

[Chorus]
What about taking this empty cup and filling it up
With a little bit more of innocence
I haven't had enough, it's probably because when you're young
It's okay to be easily ignored
I like to believe it was all about love for a child

[Verse 3]
And when the house was left in shambles
Who was there to handle all the broken bits of glass
Was it mom who put my dad out on his ass or the other way around
Well I'm far too old to care about that now

[Chorus]
What about taking this empty cup and filling it up
With a little bit more of innocence
I haven't had enough, it's probably because when you're young
It's okay to be easily ignored
I like to believe it was all about love for a child

[Verse 4]
It's kinda nice to work the floor since the divorce
I've been enjoying both my Christmases and my birthday cakes
And taking drugs and making love at far too young an age
And they never check to see my grades
What a fool I'd be to start complaining now

[Chorus]
What about taking this empty cup and filling it up
With a little bit more of innocence
I haven't had enough, it's probably because when you're young
It's okay to be easily ignored
I like to believe it was all about love for a child

[Outro]
It was all about love[Verse 1]
I picture something, it's beautiful
It's full of life, and it is all blue
I've seen the sunset on the beach, yeah
It makes me feel calm
When I'm calm, I feel good

[Pre-Chorus]
And when I feel good, I sing
And the joy it brings makes me feel good
And when I feel good, I sing
And the joy it brings

[Verse 2]
I see birds fly across the sky
And everyone's heart flies together
Food is frying and people smiling
Like there is no other way to feel good

[Pre-Chorus]
And when I feel good, I sing
And the joy it brings makes me feel good
And when I feel good, I sing
And the joy it brings

[Chorus]
Come on along
I know you really wanna feel our song
We've got some life to bring
We've got some joy in this thing
Come on along
I know you really wanna feel our song
We've got some life to bring
We've got some joy in this thing
Come on along
I know you really wanna feel our song
We've got some life to bring
We've got some joy in this thing
Come on along
I know you really wanna feel our song
We've got some life to bring
We've got some joy in this thing

Can you feel
Can you feel
Can you feel that the joy it brings
And if you can feel the joy
Then you can let your self sing
I love to share my things

[Verse 3]
Cause
It brings me freedom
Freedom
Got to get you some of that freedom
It's a freedom
Cause my Heart  living in your heart  beat
Freedom
You deserve freedom
Love to feel in it beauty
Freedom
And It's all for you all for you
All for you all for you

Singing freedom

[Outro]
Got to get to someone
Got to get to someone
Got to get to someone
Got to get to someone freedom[Verse 1]
I've been all around the world, I've been a new sensation
But it doesn't really matter in this generation
The sophomore slump is an uphill battle
And someone said that ain't my scene
'Cause they need a new song like a new religion
Music for the television
I can't do the long division
Someone do the math
For the record label puts me on the shelf up in the freezer
Gotta find another way to live the life of leisure
So I drop my top
Mix and I mingle
Is everybody ready for the single? And it goes...

[Chorus]
Ha la la la la la
Now listen closer to the verse I lay
(Ha la la la la la)
It's all about the wordplay
Ha la la la, love
The wonderful thing it does
Because, because
I am the wizard of ooh's and ah's and fa-la-la's
Yeah, the Mister A to Z
They say I'm all about the wordplay

[Verse 2]
When it's time to get ill, I got your remedy
For those who don't remember me
Well, let me introduce you to my style
I try to keep a jumble and the lyrics never mumble
When the music's makin'' people tongue-tied
You want a new song like a new religion, music for the television
I can't do the long division, someone do the math
For the people write me off like I'm a one-hit wonder
Gotta find another way to keep from going' under
Pull out the stops
Got your attention
I guess it's time again for me to mention the wordplay

[Chorus]
Ha la la la la la
Now listen closer to the verse I lay
(Ha la la la la la)
It's all about the wordplay
Ha la la la, love
The wonderful thing it does
Because, because
I am the wizard of ooh's and ah's and fa-la-la's
Yeah, the Mister A to Z
They say I'm all about the wordplay

[Verse 3]
I built a bridge across the stream my consciousness
It always seems to be a flowin'
But I don't know which way my brain is going
Oh, the rhyming and the timing keeps the melodies inside me
And they're coming till I'm running out of air
Are you prepared to take a dive into the deep end of my head?
Are you listening to a single word I've said?

[Chorus]
Ha la la la la la
Now listen closer to the verse I lay
(Ha la la la la la)
I'm stickin' to the wordplay
Ha la la la, love
The wonderful thing it does
Because, because
I am the wizard of ooh's and ah's and fa-la-la's
Yeah, the Mister A to Z
They say I'm all about the wordplay
Ha la la la la la
Now listen closer to the verse I lay
(Ha la la la la la)
I'm stickin' to the wordplay
Ha la la la, love
I love the wonderful thing it does
Because, because
I am the wizard of ooh's and ah's and fa-la-la's
Yeah, the Mister A to Z
They say it's all about the wordplayI want to, I want to hold you

Every time I go home there's another cellphone tower
Construction getting louder, paving over yesterdays
You and I, we will try to find the side of it that's pretty
While our town becomes a city, we won't let it be erased
Empires rise, empires fall
Will you be my constant through it all?

I will hold your hand
And watch the world spin idly around this life we're in
Oh yeah everything goes quiet when it's you I'm with
Oh yeah everything goes quiet when it's you I'm with
You, you, you..

Every once in a while, you know I get these real bad headaches
Worried about the mistakes that I've made along the way
You and I, we can't hide from the fact that we need each other
How else will I recover when the fever comes again

Temperatures rise, temperatures fall
Will you be my constant through it all?

I will hold your hand
And watch the world spin idly around this life we're in
Oh yeah everything goes quiet when it's you I'm with
Oh yeah everything goes quiet when it's you I'm with
You, you, you..

There are no words, no words when I'm with you, you, you
Every time I hear music, they've added more stuff to it
Things are always moving into a futuristic place
Where you and I will try, we'll try to dance into tomorrow
But time will have to borrow, not a minute left to waste

Heartbeats rise, heartbeats fall
Will you be my constant through it all?

I will hold your hand
And watch the world spin idly around this life we're in
Oh yeah everything goes quiet when it's you I'm with
Oh yeah everything goes quiet when it's you I'm with
Everything goes quiet when it's you I'm with
Everything goes quiet when it's you I'm with[Verse 1]
Drain the veins in my head
Clean out the reds in my eyes to get by security lines
Dear x-ray machine
Pretend you don't know me so well
I won't tell if you lied
Cry, cause the droughts been brought up
Drinking' cause you're looking so good in your Starbucks cup
I complain for the company that I keep
The windows for sleeping rearrange
And I'm nobody
Well who's laughing now

[Chorus]
I'm leaving your town again
And I'm over the ground that you've been spinning
And I'm up in the air said baby hell yeah
Well honey I can see your house from here
If the plane goes down, damn
I'll remember where the love was found
If the plane goes down, damn

[Verse 2]
Damn, I should be so lucky
Even only 24 hours under your touch
You know I need you so much
I cannot wait to call you
And tell you that I landed somewhere
And hand you a square of the airport
And walk you through the maze of the map
That I'm gazing at
Gracefully unnamed and feeling guilty for the luck
And the look that you gave me
You make me somebody
Ain't nobody knows me
Not even me can see it, yet I bet I'm

[Chorus]
I'm leaving your town again
And I'm over the ground that you've been spinning
And I'm up in the air said baby hell yeah
Well honey I can see your house from here
If the plane goes down, damn
I'll remember where the love was found
If the plane goes down, damn

[Bridge]
You keep me high minded
You get me high

[Verse 3]
Flax seeds, well they tear me open
And supposedly you can crawl right through me
Taste these teeth please
And undress me from these sweaters better hurry
Cause I'm keeping upward bound now
Oh maybe I'll build my house on your cloud
Here I'm tumbling for you
Stumbling through the work that I have to do
Don't mean to harm you

[Chorus]
I'm leaving your town again
And I'm over the ground that you've been spinning
And I'm up in the air said baby hell yeah
Well honey I can see your house from here
If the plane goes down, damn
I'll remember where the love was found
If the plane goes down, damn
I'll remember where the love was found
If the plane goes down, damn
I'll remember where the love was found
If the plane goes down, damn
Damn you

[Outro]
You keep me high
You keep me high minded
You get me high
You get me high minded[Verse 1]
Well you're magic he said
But don't let it all go to your head
Cause I bet if you all had it all figured out
Then you'd never get out of bed
No doubt
Of all the thing's that I've read what he wrote me
Is now sounding like the man I was hoping
To be
I Keep on keeping it real
Cause it keeps getting easier, he'll see
He's the reason that I'm laughing
Even if there's no one else
He said, you've got to love yourself

[Verse 2]
You say, you shouldn't mumble when you speak
But keep your tongue up in your cheek
And if you stumble onto something better remember that it's humble that you seek
You got all the skill you need
Individuality
You got something
You call it gumption
You call it anything you want
Because when you play the fool now
You're only fooling everyone else
You're learning to love yourself

Yes you are

[Bridge]
There's no price to pay
When you give and what you take
That's why it's easy to thank you
You

[Verse 3]
Let's say take a break from the day
And get back to the old garage
Because life's too short anyway
But at least it's better then average
As long as you got me
And I got you
You know we'll got a lot to go around
I'll be your friend
Your other brother
Another love to come and comfort you
And I'll keep reminding
If it's the only thing I ever do
I will always love
I will always love you
Yes you
I will always, always, always, always love
I will always, always love
I will always, always love, love

[Verse 4]
Climb up over the top
Survey the state of the soul
You've got to find out for yourself whether or not you're truly trying
Why not give it a shot?
Shake it. Take control and inevitably wind up
Find out for yourself all the strengths you have inside of you[Verse 1]
Mystery the moon
A hole in the sky
A supernatural nightlight
So full but often right
A pair of eyes, a closin' one
A chosen child of golden sun
A marble dog that chases cars
To farthest reaches of the beach and far beyond into the swimming sea of stars

[Verse 2]
A cosmic fish they love to kiss
They're giving birth to constellation
No riffs and oh, no reservation
If they should fall you get a wish or dedication
May I suggest you get the best
For nothing less than you and I
Let's take a chance as this romance is rising over before we lose the lighting
Oh bella bella please
Bella you beautiful luna
Oh bella do what you do
Do do do do do

[Verse 3]
You are an illuminating anchor
Of leagues to infinite number
Crashing waves and breaking thunder
Tiding the ebb and flows of hunger
You're dancing naked there for me
You expose all memory
You make the most of boundary
You're the ghost of royalty imposing love
You are the queen and king combining everything
Intertwining like a ring around the finger of a girl
I'm just a singer, you're the world
All I can bring ya
Is the language of a lover
Bella luna, my beautiful, beautiful moon
How you swoon me like no other

[Verse 4]
May I suggest you get the best
Of your wish may I insist
That no contest for little you or smaller I
A larger chance happened, all them they lie
On the rise, on the brink of our lives
Bella please
Bella you beautiful luna
Oh bella do what you do
Bella luna, my beautiful, beautiful moon
How you swoon me like no other, oh oh oh[Verse 1]
I don't want a friend (Just one more night)
I want my life in two (My life in two)
Please one more night
Waiting to get there
Waiting for you (Waiting for you)
Just one more night
I'm done fighting all night

[Pre-Chorus 1]
When I'm around slow dancing in the dark
Don't follow me, you'll end up in my arms
You done made up your mind
I don't need no more signs
Can you?
Can you?

[Chorus]
Give me reasons we should be complete
You should be with him, I can't compete
You looked at me like I was someone else, oh well
Can't you see? (Can't you see?)
I don't wanna slow dance (I don't wanna slow dance)
In the dark, dark

[Verse 2]
When you gotta run
Just hear my voice in you (My voice in you)
Shutting me out you (Shutting me out)
Doing so great (So great, so great)
You

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Used to be the one to hold you when you fall
Yeah, yeah, yeah (When you fall, when you fall)
I don't fuck with your tone (I don't fuck with your tone)
I don't wanna go home (I don't wanna go home)
Can it be one night?
Can you?
Can you?

[Chorus]
Give me reasons we should be complete
You should be with him, I can't compete
You looked at me like I was someone else, oh well
Can't you see?
I don't wanna slow dance (I don't wanna slow dance)
In the dark, dark
In the dark, dark[Verse 1]
I got knots all up in my chest (Up in my chest, up in my chest)
Just know, I'm trying my best (I'm trying my best)
'Cause when you look (When you look)
When you laugh (When you laugh)
When you smile (When you smile)
I'll bring you back (Bring you back)
And now I'm sad (Now I'm sad)
And I'm a mess (And I'm a mess)
And now we high (Now we high)
That's why I left (Why I left)
That's why I left (Whoo)
Will your tongue still remember the taste of my lips?
(My lips, my lips, my lips)
Will your shadow remember the swing of my hips?
(My hips, my hips, my hips)
Will your lover caress you the way that I did?
(I did, I did, I did)
Will you notice my charm if he slips up one bit?
(One bit)

[Chorus]
'Cause I don't need to know
I just wanna make sure you're okay (Okay)

When you lay alone, I ache

I won't be around you anymore (Around you anymore)
In a dream where you feel alright

Just better if you stay away
Better if you stay away
Won't you stay away?
Stay away, stay away
Alright[Verse 1]
I don't wanna waste my time if I can't be by your side
You really shouldn't think about God if she can't see where you hide
We don't gotta talk about nothing nice if you wanna come down
But she don't gotta know 'bout nothing
But she don't gotta know...

[Chorus]
And if the stars collide, will she relieve my soul?
And when we feel alive I know she'll let me go
When you read my lips, I know you feel all cold
But I promise you my heart is made of gold

[Verse 2]
I don't wanna waste my time if I can't make you decide
You're only on my mind when I need you
I don't need to know about what you do when the sun goes down
Cause I don't gotta know about nothing
Cause I don't gotta know...

[Chorus]
And if the stars collide, will she relieve my soul?
When we feel alive I know she'll let me go
When you read my lips, I know you feel my cold
But I promise you my heart is made of gold[Chorus]
Girl, would it kill you just to throw a little bit of attention?
If I hurt you, I'm afraid God's gonna teach me a lesson

[Pre-Chorus]
Now would you hate me if I said goodbye
So quick you could eat my dust?
Now would you hate me if I ran like hell
In the wind from dawn 'til dusk?

[Chorus]
When you cry, you waste your time
Over boys you never liked
Can you not be so obvious?
So keep it light
So keep it light, no

[Verse]
I thought I'd vocalize my troubles, but nobody will listen
I know I'm cryptic and I'm weird, that shit comes off as indifferent
I don't wanna die so young
Got so much to do
I don't smile for the camera
Only smile for you
Smile for you

[Pre-Chorus]
Now would you hate me if I said goodbye
So quick you could eat my dust?
Now would you hate me if I ran like hell
In the wind from dawn 'til dusk?

[Chorus]
When you cry, you waste your time
Over boys you never liked
Can you not?[Verse 1]
I fell for your magic, I tasted your skin
And though this is tragic, at leastIfound the end
Iwitnessed your madness, you shed lighton my sins
And if we share in this sadness, then where have you been?

[Chorus]
I know you're not in love like you used to be
Guess Im not the one, like you used to think
So you just run
I know that I'm stuck in this misery
Guess I'm not enough, like you used to think
So Ill just run (Ooh)

[Verse 2]
You bathe in your victory
You blew out on my fuse
And if I took on the planet
Will I pay my dues?
Your love was a mystery
Yeah, my love is a fool
And I travel the country just to get to you

[Chorus]
I know you're not in love like you used to be
Guess I'm not the one, like you used to think
So you just run
I know that I'm stuck in this misery
Guess I'm not enough, like you used to think
So I'll just run

[Outro]
And I travel the country
And I travel the country just to get to you
I know you're not in love
I know you're not in love
I know youre not in love[Chorus]
I can't get over you
Cant get over you
And before I die I pray that
I could be the one
That I could be the one
But I won't be no fun
If I can't have you, no one can

[Verse]
Highlights, in the limelight
Can you show me, to the nightlife
Baby I like, all colors like
But I want you, and I dont know right (Don't know right)
Tell me more, I got a box cutter with your name on it
Tell me more, I can't stay this long on the same topic
I don't know you, but would I fall in love with you?
I don't have no social cues
I'm all for you (Ayy)

[Chorus]
I can't get over you (Ooh, yeah, ooh, ooh)
Can't get over you
And before I die I pray (Yup) that
I could be the one
That I could be the one
But I wont be no fun
If I cant have you, no one can[Chorus]

She just want a test drive (She just want a test drive)
Dying on the west side (Dying on the west side)
I'll see you in the next life (See you in the next life)

[Verse 1]
What do you want, babe? (What do you want, babe?)
I don't like when you taunt me (I don't like when you taunt me)
You've been calling the wrong name (Calling the wrong name)
I said what do you want, babe? (What do you want, babe?)
I'm working on my aim (Working on my aim)
I'm hoping you do the same (Do the same)
You got me afraid again (Got me afraid again)
So let me just pray again (So let me just pray again)

[Pre-Chorus]
You gon' jump through hoops
Know how many lines you'll do
Won't matter when you lose
Everything I've done for you

[Chorus]
She don't wanna tell lies
She don't wanna tell lies
She just wanna feel alive
She just wanted more time
I'm looking for a long ride
She just want a test drive (What do you want, babe?)
Dying on the west side (What do you want, babe?)
I'll see you in the next life (Who do you want, babe?)

[Verse 2]
Waiting on a sacrificial life
Waiting on the ones who didn't fight
I told you not to waste my fucking time
I told you never sing that song, you lied

[Pre-Chorus]
You gon' jump through hoops
Know how many lines you'll do
Won't matter when you lose
Everything I've done for you

So tenderly you watch me burn, you watch me burn, oh
So tell me, am I crazy?

And I don't wanna die
No, I don't wanna die
I don't wanna die[Verse 1]
Here I am
Torn into a thousand shapes and folds
Torn into a thousand ways, I know
Fornicate inside your broken homes
Before I throw a smile your way, no more

[Verse 2]
I can't tell
If all my answers correlate at all
I'm telling you a thousand things I know

[Chorus]
I've been missing a long time
To know I had to move
I've been waiting my whole life
To know I wanted you
Are you feeling me slowly?
You can take your fucking time
And I promise I won't lie
We'll make it out alive

[Verse 3]
I'm on trial
I'm not so good at hiding wholesome truths
You see it on my face when I turn blue
So punish me, I'm hanging on your noose
So pull me up so I can breathe with you

[Chorus]
I know
I've been missing a long time
To know I had to move
I've been waiting my whole life
To know I wanted you
Are you feeling me slowly?
You can take your fucking time
And I promise I won't lie
We'll make it out alive

Remember those times I fought to get out?
I want to get out

These people aren't real, so make me this deal
Won't you?

Oh, will you keep up with me? (Ooh)
Everyone's looking for someone to hold (Ooh)
But I can't let you go (Ooh, ooh)

I find it hard to be myself
I shed my skin for everybody else
You don't know me, what the fuck you mean?
You made me sad and you made me mean
And now I'm mad, I feel unclean (I feel unclean, I feel unclean)
'Cause I'm a bitter fuck
'Cause I'm a bitter fuck
You made me a bitter fuck
Ay, (fuck), ay

Head down, eyes closed
Ice cold, meltdown[Intro: Joji]
Searching for a reason why, oh
Searching where the leaves don't grow, grow, grow

[Verse: Joji]
Yo
The pitter-patter gave a rather rinse and lather feeling
As opposed to shitty attitudes that made me bitter after laughter
And I deeply regretted it
I take the D train to go to BK
I can't defeat rain

[Hook: Joji & Ariana Grande]
And as far as we go
And as far as we go
And how little we know
And how little we know
Searching for the weekend love
Searching where the leaves don't fall
When the land is widow (Oh)
Fall to the ground

Speak to me (Oh, oh, oh, god, oh)
Speak to me (Oh, oh, oh, god, oh)

Yelling at the top of my lungs, but I'm always at the top of the cunt

But with the company paying to make me bitter, yo

Tell me what you mean
When you whisper late at night

Oh, da da da da da da, beat to the march, getting ill, oh

There's nowhere to run
There's nowhere to run
Coming undone

It was all a dream, I used to read Word Up! magazine
Salt-n-Pepa and Heavy D up in the limousine
Hanging pictures on my wall
Every Saturday Rap Attack, Mr. Magic, Marley Marl
I let my tape rock 'til my tape popped
Smoking weed on Bambu, sipping on Private Stock
Way back, when I had the red and black lumberjack
With the hat to match
Remember Rapping Duke? Duh-ha, duh-ha
You never thought that hip hop would take it this far
Now I'm in the limelight 'cause I rhyme tight
Time to get paid, blow up like the World Trade
Born sinner, the opposite of a winner
Remember when I used to eat sardines for dinner
For dinner
I used to eat sardines for dinner
Peace to Ron G, Brucey B, Kid Capri

[Chorus]
I still see your shadows in my room
Can't take back the love that I gave you
It's to the point where I love and I hate you
And I cannot change you, so I must replace you, oh
Easier said than done, I thought you were the one
Listenin' to my heart instead of my head
You found another one, but I am the better one
I won't let you forget me
I still see your shadows in my room
Can't take back the love that I gave you
It's to the point where I love and I hate you
And I cannot change you, so I must replace you, oh
Easier said than done, I thought you were the one
Listenin' to my heart instead of my head
You found another one, but I am the better one
I won't let you forget me

[Verse]
You left me falling and landing inside my grave
I know that you want me dead
I take prescriptions to make me feel a-okay
I know it's all in my head
I have these lucid dreams where I can't move a thing
Thinking of you in my bed
You were my everything
Thoughts of a wedding ring
Now I'm just better off dead (Uh, uh, uh)
I'll do it over again
I didn't want it to end
I watch it blow in the wind
I should've listened to my friends
Leave this shit in the past, but I want it to last
You were made outta plastic, fake
I was tangled up in your drastic ways
Who knew evil girls had the prettiest face?
You gave me a heart that was full of mistakes
I gave you my heart and you made heartbreak

[Bridge]
You made my heart break
You made my heart ache (I still see your shadows in my room)
You made my heart break
You made my heart ache (Can't take back the love that I gave you)
You made my heart break (Were made outta plastic, fake)
You made my heart ache (I still see your shadows in my room)
You made my heart break again (I was tangled up in your drastic ways)
(Who knew evil girls had the prettiest face?)

[Chorus]
I still see your shadows in my room
Can't take back the love that I gave you
It's to the point where I love and I hate you
And I cannot change you, so I must replace you, oh
Easier said than done, I thought you were the one
Listenin' to my heart instead of my head
You found another one, but I am the better one
I won't let you forget me
I still see your shadows in my room
Can't take back the love that I gave you
It's to the point where I love and I hate you
And I cannot change you, so I must replace you, oh

Listenin' to my heart instead of my head
You found another one, but I am the better one

Mhm, they're rotting my brain, love
These hoes are the same

[Verse 1]
I admit it, another ho got me finished
Broke my heart, oh, no, you didn't
Fuck sippin', I'ma down a whole bottle
Hard liquor, hard truth, can't swallow
Need a bartender, put me out my sorrow
Wake up the next day in the Monte Carlo
With a new woman, tell me she from Colorado
And she love women, she'll be gone by tomorrow
Who am I kiddin'?
All this jealousy and agony that I sit in
I'm a jealous boy, really feel like John Lennon
I just want real love, guess it's been a minute
Pissed off from the way that I don't fit in (I don't fit in)
Tell me, what's the secret to love? I don't get it
Feel like I be runnin' a race I'm not winnin'
Ran into the devil today and she grinnin'

[Pre-Chorus]
Hey, these girls are insane, yeah, uh

[Chorus]
All girls are the same, they're rotting my brain, love
Think I need a change before I go insane, love
All girls are the same, they're rotting my brain, love
Think I need a change before I go insane, love

[Verse 2]
Ten minutes, she told me it would take ten minutes
To break my heart, oh, no, she didn't
Fuck livin', I'ma drown in my sorrow
Fuck givin', I'ma take, not borrow
And I'm still sinnin', I'm still losin' my mind
I know I been trippin', I'm still wastin' my time
All the time given, am I dyin'? Am I livin'?
It's fuck feelings, my sorrow go up to the ceilin'

[Pre-Chorus]
Ah

[Chorus]
Now I am insane, demons in my brain, love
Peace I can't attain 'cause all these girls the same, love
Now I am insane, demons in my brain, love
Peace I can't attain 'cause all these girls the same, love[Intro]
I usually don't speak on shit like this, but

Daytrip took it to ten (Hey)

[Chorus]
I usually have an answer to the question, but this time I'm gon' be quiet (This time)
Ain't nothing like the feeling of uncertainty, the eeriness of silence
This time, it was so unexpected
Last time, it was the drugs he was lacing
All legends fall in the making, yeah, sorry truth, uh
Dying young, uh, demon youth

[Verse 1]
What's the 27 Club? We ain't making it past 21
I been going through paranoia, so I always gotta keep a gun
Damn, that's the world we live in now
Yeah, hold on, just hear me out
They tell me I'ma be a legend, I don't want that title now
'Cause all the legends seem to die out, what the fuck is this 'bout?
I'm tryna make it out, I'm tryna change the world
I'm tryna take her out, I'm tryna take your girl
More importantly, I'm tryna change the world
Maybe flex with some diamonds and pearls, yeah

[Chorus]
I usually have an answer to the question, but this time I'm gon' be quiet (This time)
Ain't nothing like the feeling of uncertainty, the eeriness of silence
This time, it was so unexpected
Last time, it was the drugs he was lacing
All legends fall in the making, yeah, sorry truth, uh
Dying young, uh, demon youth

[Verse 2]
My mind is foggy, I'm so confused
We keep on losing our legends to
The cruel cold world, what is it coming to?
The end of the world, is it coming soon?

[Interlude]
Now, ooh, ooh, oh
That hit's for you

[Chorus]
I usually have an answer to the question, but this time I'm gon' be quiet (This time)
Ain't nothing like the feeling of uncertainty, the eeriness of silence

Man, what? (Haha)
This shit funny, one sec
Oof, this Hennessy strong as fuck, boy

[Chorus]
She told me put my heart in the bag (In the bag)
And nobody gets hurt (No hurt)
Now I'm running from her love, I'm not fast (Fast)
So I'm making it worse (Making it worse)
Now I'm digging up a grave, from my past
I'm a whole different person (I'm a whole different person)
It's a gift and a curse (It's a gift and a curse)
But I cannot reverse it

[Verse 1]
I can't reverse it
It was a gift and a curse
And now I'm drinkin' too much, so I'ma talk with a slur
Last time I saw you, it ended in a blur
I woke up in a hearse
You said, "You loved me first" (First)
One thing my dad told me was, "Never let your woman know when you're insecure"
So I put Gucci on the fur
And I put my wrist on iceberg
One thing my heart tells me is
"Flex on a ho every time they're insecure"
I guess you came through, I'm running from you
Is your love for real? (For real? For real?)
Is your love really true?

[Chorus]
She told me put my heart in the bag (In the bag)
And nobody gets hurt (Hurt)
Now I'm running from her love, I'm not fast (Fast)
So I'm making it worse (Worse)
Now I'm digging up a grave, from my past (Past)
I'm a whole different person (Person)
It's a gift and a curse (Curse)
But I cannot reverse it

[Bridge]
You gave me the runaround
I really hate the runaround
You really got me paranoid
I always keep a gun around
You always give me butterflies
When you come around
When you come around
When you come around

[Verse 2]
You let me know love is not the answer
Not the answer, not the answer
I love to do drugs so mind my manners
I get high when you don't decide to answer
Phone home, I need to phone home
I'm throwing rocks at your window, I need to go home
I don't wanna leave
I just wanna be with you
You, you, you

[Chorus]
She told me put my heart in the bag (In the bag)
And nobody gets hurt (No hurt)
Now I'm running from her love, I'm not fast (Fast)
So I'm making it worse (I'm making it worse)
Now I'm digging up a grave, from my past
I'm a whole different person (I'm a whole different person)
It's a gift and a curse (It's a gift and a curse)
But I cannot reverse it[Intro]
Drugs got me sweatin', but the room gettin' colder
Lookin' at the devil and the angel on my shoulder
Will I die tonight? I don't know, is it over?
Lookin' for my next high, I'm lookin' for closure

[Chorus]
Lean with me, pop with me
Get high with me if you rock with me
Smoke with me, drink with me
Fucked up liver with some bad kidneys
Lean with me, pop with me
Get high with me if you rock with me
Smoke with me, drink with me
Fucked up liver with some bad kidneys

[Verse 1]
Told her if I die, I'ma die young
Every day I've been gettin' fucked up
Finally know the difference between love and drugs
Shawty tell me I should really sober up
This shit ain't fiction, it's too real, too real
Fuck one dose, I need two pills, two pills
I'm lookin' for trouble so I know I'm gonna find it
Ring, ring, plug hit my phone, perfect timin'
I know I'm not right
But I'm not wrong, no, I'm not wrong
Girl, you hate it when I'm too high
But that's where I belong, where I belong

[Chorus]
Lean with me, pop with me
Get high with me if you rock with me
Smoke with me, drink with me
Fucked up liver with some bad kidneys
Lean with me, pop with me
Get high with me if you rock with me
Smoke with me, drink with me
Fucked up liver with some bad kidneys

[Verse 2]
Eyes red, no Visine
Crashed the Mustang, no Saleen
Yeah, I love beans, yeah, I love lean
I laugh when they ask if my piss clean
Huh, smoke with me, huh, pop with me, huh
Ayy, Gucci store, come and shop with me
If I overdose, bae, are you gon' drop with me?
I don't even wanna think about that right now
Let's get too high, reach a new height
Take the shrooms and the pills at the same time
Went to Hollywood thrills from the street life
Took too many drugs, now I don't feel right

[Chorus]
Lean with me, pop with me
Get high with me if you rock with me
Smoke with me, drink with me
Fucked up liver with some bad kidneys
Lean with me, pop with me

Lil' boy, I'm your father, hakuna matata
I made that girl give all of that top up
Got dreads in my head, used to pray for the lock up
I hit from the back and my legs start to lock up
Jacuzzi that booty, I gave that girl flakka
I'm takin' blue caps that keep tweakin' my chakra
Rose on my chain, there's no hint like no copper
Tats in the middle my head like I'm Avatar
That's the reason that I ride on my Appas

All that lean I sip on, now watch me pour it
One cup on me, don't got no friends

She ain't take my heart, but she took my medicine
Least somebody gon' take it, hate to waste it

Wasted, GTA love, bitches wasted
Wasted, I'm on these drugs, I feel wasted
Wasted, get her off my mind when I'm wasted
Wasted, I waste all my time when I'm wasted (Yeah)
Wasted, GTA love, bitches wasted
Wasted, I'm on these drugs, I feel wasted
Wasted, get her off my mind when I'm wasted
Wasted, I waste all my time when I'm wasted
Wasted

[Outro: Juice WRLD]
Wasted, wasted, wasted, wasted[Chorus]
From the unknown
I ran away, I don't think I'm coming back home
Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa
Like a crawlspace, it's a dark place I roam
Ain't no right way, just the wrong way I know
I problem-solve with Styrofoam
My world revolves around a black hole
The same black hole that's in place of my soul, uh
Empty, I feel so goddamn empty
I may go rogue
Don't tempt me, big bullet holes
Tote semi-autos

[Verse 1]
Huh, yeah
I'm keepin' it real, real
I'm keepin' it real, uh, yeah
Life gets tough, shit is getting real (Yeah)
I don't know how to feel
Swallowing all these pills
Numb my real feels, uh
Devil standing here
Tryna' make a deal, uh
It ain't no deals
Feel like I'm going crazy but still took a lot to get me here
Losing my sanity up in a house in the hills, hills, hills
I ain't have anything then and I still don't have anything still, still, still, uh
Bein' me, I rock, PnB
These hoes actin' like gossip, TMZ
These drugs acting like
Mosh pits squishing me
Oh my, oh me, how they kill me slowly
Lonely, I been gettin' no peace
OD, feel like overdosing
Low key I been looking for the signs
But all I can find is a sign of the times

[Chorus]
From the unknown
I ran away, I don't think I'm coming back home
Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa
Like a crawlspace, it's a dark place I roam
Ain't no right way, just the wrong way I know
I problem-solve with Styrofoam
My world revolves around a black hole
The same black hole that's in place of my soul, uh
Empty, I feel so goddamn empty
I may go rogue
Don't tempt me, big bullet holes
Tote semi-autos

[Verse 2]
I ain't suicidal
Only thing suicide is suicide doors
Fight for survival
Gotta keep hope up, rolling good dope up (Uh)
Hold my hand, through hell we go
Don't look back, it ain't the past no more
Gonna get to the racks, all them niggas want war
Yeah, I was put here to lead the lost souls
Exhale depression as the wind blows
These are the laws of livin' in vogue
We're perfectly imperfect children
Rose from the dust, all of us are on a mission
Never gave a fuck, really came from rags to riches
Now we live it up, driving with the rooftop missin'
I don't give a fuck, really came from rags to riches
Now I live it up, driving with the rooftop missin'

[Chorus]
From the unknown
I ran away, I don't think I'm coming back home
Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa
Like a crawlspace, it's a dark place I roam
Ain't no right way, just the wrong way I know
I problem-solve with Styrofoam
My world revolves around a black hole
The same black hole that's in place of my soul, uh
Empty, I feel so goddamn empty
I may go rogue
Don't tempt me, big bullet holes
Tote semi-autos[Intro]

Takin' medicine to fix all of the damage
My anxiety the size of a planet (Yeah, ooh)
Holes in my skull, over time
My heart's over ice (Woah)

[Verse 1]
Over ice, I'm freezing
Beautiful eyes, deceiving
We may die this evening
Coughing, wheezing, bleeding
High, I'm an anxious soul
Blood moons are my eyes, stay low
Red and black, they glow
Under attack, in my soul
When it's my time, I'll know
Never seen a hell so cold
Yeah, we'll make it out, I'll know
We'll run right through the flames, let's go (Go)

I'm in too deep
Can't swim like me
We're drowning, so I will see
My demons ten feet, under me
Inhale, exhale, but I can't breathe
Too busy drinking codeine doin' high speeds
Crash, pour a four, sip it slow, make the time pass
Take a pill for the thrill, have a relapse
Devil in my head tryna run gym laps
I ain't tryna race, he don't even know me like that

[Chorus]
All white Gucci suit, I'm feeling righteous
I know that the truth is hard to digest
Five or six pills in my right hand

Daytrip took it to ten (Hey!)
Fine, fine

[Chorus]
Say they wanna read my mind
They really wanna read my mind
Telling you right now, all you'll find
Is a lost soul, rich and blind
They say they wanna read my mind
Do you really wanna read my mind?
I promise, all that you will find
Is a lost soul, rich and blind

[Verse 1]
I know I have a purpose, but I don't see the purpose
They tell me the death of me gon' be the Perkys
I know they laced pills, I bought them on purpose
Life's unreal when death's uncertain
It's funny how the blessed ones had the most curses
Heart falling to the floor if we lose another person
Take three more, I swear it's worth it
But it ain't no world tour if I'm laying in a hearse
I remember losing lil' bro, he laying in the dirt
Now I'm bound to drop a tear or two on every single verse
Good terms, bad terms, when they die, it's the worst
Sometimes when I'm high, I feel high in reverse
I ain't going out like that, you fuck with me, you get the work
You ain't gon' see me in no wooden box, I'm gonna shoot 'em first
I promise y'all I'm finna touch the world, yeah, I'ma touch the Earth
But hold on, your girl on my line, I think I may just fuck her first
Yeah, gotta have some crude humor
Just to keep a good vibe going, keep the song grooving
So all my money longer, shout out bro Uzi
Keep my eyes in the sky 'cause that's where I'm moving

[Chorus]
Say they wanna read my mind
They really wanna read my mind
Telling you right now, all you'll find
Is a lost soul, rich and blind
They say they wanna read my mind
Do you really wanna read my mind?
I promise, all that you will find
Is a lost soul, rich and blind (Blind)

[Post-Chorus]
Is a lost soul, rich and blind
Blind, blind, blind

[Verse 2]
This is dedicated to you if you felt the lowest of the low
I know how it feels, you don't wanna struggle anymore
Used to ball hard, ain't no triple-doubles anymore
Bitch, I'm talking 'bout my tears
Turned around and faced my fears
I haven't felt this low in years
We die in three like musketeers
Ain't too many real niggas left in here
R.I.P. to all my peers
Smoking loud pack, what you say? I can't hear
But I still hear the fallen ones in my ears
Why, why do we live to die, die?
When it's my time, time, time
I'll leave behind my end, my thirteen reasons why

[Chorus]
Say they wanna read my mind
They really wanna read my mind
Telling you right now, all you'll find
Is a lost soul, rich and blind
They say they wanna read my mind
Do you really wanna read my mind?
I promise, all that you will find
Is a lost soul, rich and blind (Blind)

[Post-Chorus]
Is a lost soul, rich and blind
Blind, blind, blind

Yeah, I pray that I'll get it right this time

Maybe we'll be alright

Even if that means I ain't by your side

[Chorus]
I'd do anything in my power, to see you just smile
I want you to prosper, and come proper
Even if that means I ain't by your side
I'd do anything in my power, to see you just smile

It's been months since I felt at home
But it's okay 'cause I'm rich, psych
I'm still sad as a bitch, right

I don't try to be mean on purpose, I promise
My mama taught me better than that, I'll be honest
I blame it on the drugs and this life I'm involved in

[Pre-Chorus]

[Verse 1]
Break away and make a way to make it
Love the way you lookin' when you naked
Treat your heart just like a blunt of OG
Roll it up, I kissed it and I smoke it
Gots to be joking
Where in the fuck did you think you were going?
Foldin' and packin' your clothes like you ain't know I was gon' unfold it
Wine glass full of your emotions
Oh, Pinot Grigio, sippin', beautiful, heaven-soul woman
Me don't know, let me know, let me
In your heart, don't you dare forget me
I'm your fan, your posters on my walls inside my head, yeah, yeah

You drive me insane, no girl make me feel this way
Wait girl, you got your ways, girl you are my getaway
Wait, let me keep you safe
In exchange, give me brain, brain
You my main thing, turn around, bang bang
Hit the beach in LA like you a beach ball
Me and you in the Lambo truck, you start it up and skrrt off
We park after dark at the park by the mansion, take your skirt off
Oh, me can't wait to get all up inside of it
My heart is racing, every time I'm tastin' it
Wait until the drugs fade out
Hate making love when I'm faded
That's because I wanna feel it
Girl, you give me the best feelin'
Yes, girl you're the best, take away stress, love me to death
Even when I'm a mess

[Chorus]

You're way too much, way too much
Not scared to love, just scared of love
Not enough, I'm not enough
You're way too much and I'm not getting enough
You're way too much, still not getting enough

[Verse 1]
You're way too much, too, too much
The weight is heavy on my shoulders, girl, you're too much
You put my heart in a grave, I get no love
So I need more drugs, way too much
All I ever do is get fucked up
All I ever wanted was a real love
Got a pint of the lean, I done lucked up
Bros said that it wasn't real mud
Every day I wonder if I can pick my heart out my chest
Lately I been feelin' the worst
So I gotta dress like the best
Moncler all on my chest
VVS all on my neck
Ballin' like a fucking upset
They're beyond stressed
I been hurt but I'm beyond that

[Chorus]
I never been scared of love, scared to love
I'm on the drugs way too much
I'm not enough, not enough
You're way too much, way too much
Not scared to love, just scared of love
Not enough, I'm not enough
You're way too much and I'm not getting enough
You're way too much, still not getting enough

[Verse 2]
We woke up in hell, baby, can't you tell?
As far as I can tell, you're the only heaven here
I'm running out of Xans, running out of options
I really need to chill 'fore I'm in a coffin
Way too late, Russian roulette, okay
I know I been dead for a minute now
Ain't wanna be alive, no way

[Chorus]
I never been scared of love, scared to love
I'm on the drugs way too much
I'm not enough, not enough
You're way too much, way too much
Not scared to love, just scared of love
Not enough, I'm not enough
You're way too much and I'm not getting enough
You're way too much, still not getting enough[Intro]
I don't know if it's because my heart hurts or if I'm insecure
I'm not sure
(Yeah, I like that)
Uh

[Chorus]
Yeah, I'm not sure
I don't know if it's because my heart hurts or if I'm insecure
Baby, you're not her
My last girl had me so fucked up, it was a blacked out blur
Baby, you jump first
It's a long way to hell, I ain't really tryna leave this Earth
Baby, do your worst
I've come to the conclusion you can't kill me if I kill you first

[Verse 1]
I've been through the wringer
Tryna put a diamond ring on her finger
She love drama, she be watching Jerry Springer
Next thing you know, we all on Jerry Springer
I play love games, but no, I'm not a cheater
She hate it when I sip codeine, I'm a leaner
The devil on my shoulder keep on telling me to keep her
Should I take her out or should I take her to the cleaner?
Love don't end good for me, no good for me
She's good for me, too good
These hoes love playing me, heartbreaking me
Don't pray for me, just give me drugs (Bring me drugs)

[Bridge]
Just give me drugs
Just bring me drugs
Just give me drugs

[Chorus]
Yeah, I'm not sure
I don't know if it's because my heart hurts or if I'm insecure
Baby, you're not her
My last girl had me so fucked up, it was a blacked out blur
Baby, you jump first
It's a long way to hell, I ain't really tryna leave this Earth
Baby, do your worst
I've come to the conclusion you can't kill me if I kill you first

[Verse 2]
I told her, "Run around and get away"
I think I need a getaway
I need to call a timeout, I need to set another play
I need a umbrella 'cause every day feel like a rainy day
I need something other than Xannies to take the pain away
I ran away to California, I'm tryna cut corners
Satan bossin' me around, but you know I don't take orders
Yeah, I had to move around, I was startin' to feel cornered
Startin' to feel cornered, I can't see the front door
Startin' to feel cornered, startin' to feel slaughtered
Started to not give a fuck, screamin' out, "Why bother?"
My ex-bitch too bad, my next bitch way hotter
We met in a car crash, she ride it like full throttle

[Chorus]
Yeah, I'm not sure
I don't know if it's because my heart hurts or if I'm insecure
Baby, you're not her
My last girl had me so fucked up, it was a blacked out blur
Baby, you jump first
It's a long way to hell, I ain't really tryna leave this Earth
Baby, do your worst
I've come to the conclusion you can't kill me if I kill you first[Intro]
Yeah, uh, uh
Uh-huh, huh, hahaha
Some of y'all be sayin' y'all freestylin'
But y'all be like... spittin' writtens and shit
Haha, that's BS
Uh, uh-huh, uh, uh-huh, uh, uh-huh
Uh, I don't even write my wrongs, haha
Ayy, yuh

[Verse 1]
Off the top, kickin' it, no karate class
Janitor, I'll mop his ass up, chop his ass up
I'm the best at what I do, can't nobody do it better
Yo girl a sprinkler system from the way I get her wetter
Uh, I'm out the jam like jelly
I'ma go hard, catch the shot like Belly
I'm the best to ever do it, have 'em leakin' body fluids
Feel like Waka Flocka "O Let's Do It" when I'm on this music
Off the dome when I'm kickin' it
Kinda like I got a impediment when I'm spittin' it
I been rippin' writtens without writing a damn thing
I'm doin' my damn thing, I rap and I sing
I ring like bells, king
That's me, you better king me
I'm married to the money, fuck it, need to buy a ring, b
I pull up on the scene, choppa get to fuckin' ringing
Like a joke or something, choppa get the zine king, aha

Your bitch too sleazy, .40 bless you, sneezin'
I'm the best to ever do it, take yo breath away, you not breathin', uh
Breaking Bad method how I sell this meth
Retrospect, put that shit back in retrospect
Take yo specs, take yo bitch, grab her breast, tat her chest
I'm the best to ever do it, I'ma say that again
Lord forgive me on this mic, 'cause I know I'm finna sin
Killin' him, him, and him, referencin' Eminem
All these other rappers ain't shit but feminine, and
I don't really got time for it
They can have a penny 'cause I don't really got a dime for it
Catch me rockin' Tom Ford and some Air Forces
With a passport and a black torch
Comin' up the full court, pressed like Kobe or somethin'
Super clutch in the fourth like Ginobili or somethin'
You say you ballin' like you Jordan, nigga, nah, you frontin'
Run up on me, that's okay, that choppa on me get the Jumpman

You run up on me, I hit 'em, that choppa on me like a tongue

I got all the girls sprung, pull up on the scene like a "he hung"
I'm of the best to ever do it, say that again
Off the dome, kickin' it, that's just how it is
I don't got to write shit, I see it like a psychic
Your girl like a Huffy commercial, she ride like bikes, kid
I'm the best to ever do it, yeah, I said it, huh, and I meant it
Listen to my lyrics, man, I vibe on this bitch
Roll a blunt up, a OG, and get high on this bitch
Mix it with the pills and liquor, I may die on this bitch
Did I that shit on purpose? Suicide in that bitch, huh
Suicide doors with a suicide whore
Drivin' off a bridge, I call that a suicide Porsche, haha
Ooh, we kickin' it, man, look
I pull up in a four-door flippin' like parkour
Fuck yo bitch on camera and call that shit a hardcore
Hard porn, sharper than harpoons
I come through with three bullets in my face, that's a war room
Animated like cartoons when I'm off the shrooms
Niggas dirty so that choppa actin' like brooms, uh
Niggas salty like Spongebob and spittoon, uh
Pull up on the scene, huh, that's just me, uh
Hey, switch that shit up real quick, uh-huh
I may come back to that, I don't know

[Verse 2]
Uh-huh, I was just talkin' about how I like Tyler and then Cole
Uh, I'ma, uh
I'ma fuckin' Dapper Dan in a pair of Gucci socks
Runnin' up on me you get popped
Catch the shot out the Glock, I'm the Juice, word to Pac
Run up on me, pop your top, matter of fact, better back up
'Cause I'm in the back of the truck, with the MAC tucked
Tell that nigga condiment or somethin', he need to catch up
He can't catch us, them niggas can't back us, huh
Man, them niggas need some backup
I'm on the scene, boolin' with my bros
Like Drake with the 6, runnin' through it with my woes
Run up on me like Shaquille, in the paint I'm throwin' bows
You a ballerina 'cause I keep you on your toes
Shout out to them Florida niggas, I know some zos
Run up, that's okay, I'm finna let the choppa blow
I'm on Westwood, ridin' through yo hood
Like Red Ridin', strikin' like bright lightnin', my flow is too excitin'
I'll end yo world like Mayans, off the dome, kickin' it
Try me if you think I'm lyin', man, listen how I do it
I get brain from a smart bitch but she stupid
Put an arrow through yo heart, but no, I'm not Cupid
Make you shuffle when I shoot, but no, it's not Cupid
The wordplay is so cold, my heart is so gone
Yo bitch is so sprung, yeah, I put the team on
She gon' give the whole team head, call that a crew neck
But I'm wearin' a sweater, I'ma get her wetter, uh
I'm the best to ever do it, I'll say that shit forever
No matter the weather, knock 'em out like Floyd Mayweather
I'm off the dome kickin' it, that's just how it is
I'm Khalifa with the reefer but I never been a wiz
Tricks are for grownups, they said they were for kids
Hell nah, 'cause you will get popped off like a zit
If you fuckin' with my money cuz, I'm all about a grip
Tell yo bitch to swallow kids and I'll tell you to swallow clips
Rest in piss, rest in this, matter of fact, I'ma go hard
Spit crack like Bobby Brown and grill 'em like Bogart
Stomp the yard like Chris Brown like he got shot in the movie
I'm hotter than white bitches chillin' in a jacuzzi
My money got longer, shout out to Uzi
I'm in the scene with a nina, you run up, I'm shootin'
I swear that you don't want no problems with me, it's over with
Call me everything but sober, I am not with that sober shit
It's a union with my gang, come around like a Soviet
Matter of fact, I'm finna gamble for this shit, where your poker chips?
If you run up, you'll, you'll get cranked like Soulja did
I'ma drop bars same way I drop bombs
You ain't on shit, WW-dot-com
I forgot a W, I took that out, 'cause that W stand for "Win"
I never took the losin' route, I always took the losers out
Eeny meeny miney moe, I always pick the choosers out
She got titties, when she come around I pick the hooters out
Run up on me, that's okay, they beefin' on computers now?
I'm not worried about these niggas, keep a .30 on my hip
I Steph Curry about these niggas
These niggas hella soft, man I worry about these niggas
I never run away, I don't flurry away from niggas
That nigga lil' pussy, he furry, ain't he, lil' nigga?
Pull up on the scene, you know I'm with it
My windows tinted, pulled up clean with a "Stop, you're finished"
You know we dig it
I'm ballin' like Dennis Rodman, I'm fuckin' awesome
I'm bombin' like atomic, my eyes are redder than demonic
I'm faster than sonic, I'm faster, withdrawals got me fastin'
My stomach movin' slow like molasses
I got it, run up on me, I'm poppin'
Feel like Drake when I'm rappin' 'cause I start from the bottom
All this shit that I'm talkin', I could probably back it up
I slide into yo bitch DM like a sled and toboggan
For your brains I may bargain, I caught you lackin' at Target
I'll turn yo ass to a target then threw yo ass in the garbage
Run up on me, it's nothing, I swear to god that I'm bussin'
Like a Proactiv commercial or somethin', haha
These niggas makin' assumption, me, I'm just makin' this money, huh
I wear Givenchy, you still in Abercrombie, you see the difference?
Broke niggas and rich niggas, showin' the distance
This is a business relationship, fuck a friendship
All these other niggas fake like, "What you got over there?
Let me get something off your plate," nah
I did this by myself so I don't need nobody help
Shit, I'm a giant, you an elf, I put yo brains up on a shelf after I collect it
Matter of fact, my mind is my weapon
Slide through yo block again and catch some sloppy seconds
That's a preference, I heard you like talkin' about heaven
Well I send yo ass to hell, right next to Jezebel, uh, huh
You can catch twenty shells, you a fat pussy, you get shot, Garfield
I got bars like jail barbells, these niggas not funny, huh, Seinfeld, aha
But my flow is so unpredictable
Fuckin' with me is like steppin' in a minefield
Man, I could never mess up, I gotta fess up, this is a confession
I pull up on the scene with my .40, it came from my plaster
That shit's a blessing, huh, I leave you in the past tense
I wrap the rap in plastics, that's just some plaster rap
But I'm still the realest rapper after the fact, huh, can you imagine that?
Man, these niggas sick to hell, Johnson couldn't magic that
Man, this rappin' shit is such a passion
Not a father when I did it so I'm callin' me a bastard
And these niggas talkin' dumb to me
But that shit doesn't matter, 'cause my pockets gettin' fatter
And I'm climbin' like a ladder, outer space, I'm up on Saturn
With some niggas that came from my hometown
They really rowdy, you run up, that's okay
I swear to God we get to growlin' and bouncin' and pouncin'
You gon' need a bouncer, we robbin' yo accountant for everything
So much money that I ain't even count yet
Life's a bitch, why is mine keep playin' farfetched
These niggas ain't locked up, haven't seen bars yet
My gun singin' like Barbra, guess, Streisand
I got a knife in my right hand, your bitch in my left hand
Her meth in my back pocket, I'll give it to her in a second
If she keep jockin', I'll rip your eyes out of your head
If you keep watchin', I am the best rapper in here
The best rapper over there, the best rapper everywhere
I can say what I want and it come out how I want it
Run up if you want, that's okay 'cause it's over
I really do not condone it, I don't fuck with opponents
It's commas, no exponents, but these bullets come in three
And they singin' like Jonas, I don't really got no smoke
But if you want it I got it, I pull it out and I pop it
I send some shots at your noggin, I remember rockin' Robins
Back at the bottom, now it's Givenchy and Gucci
All over my pair of pockets, man, maybe I should stop it
Let's keep goin' man, I'm just feelin' nauseous
Off the Henny, that's the remedy
A hundred in these clips, so if I shoot it that's a centipede
I stick it on the Lamborghini, drivin' like a century
It's 21 inside this clip, like the century, I'm schoolin' niggas
Ruler and the Glock, elementary, I'm in her mouth like a dentist
She made me replenish, I'm ballin' like I'm Dennis
Rodman, rotten, plottin', freestyle, no jottin', I got it
Man I could rap forever, if I go broke Westwood I'ma trap forever
So cold I could go to Siberia and trap the weather
I could trap in Siberia, I could trap wherever
Man, rainy weather, sunny weather, either way, it goes
My gun with me 'cause let's go, ooh
Next beat, next beat, I may come back, ahahaha
Next part, what should I kill? Cool, uh, uh-huh, yeah, uh

[Verse 3]
Catch me spittin' on this Kill beat
Hopin' that these niggas would just feel me, the real me
My weapon is concealed and
You know I'm a suspect when I walk into the building
I came to London just to make some noise
The shit I say is for grown men, these bars are not for lil' boys
I'm Andy with these toys
You run up on me, you get flexed on like Terry Crews and steroids
Listen, I been ballin' like a Piston
I been marchin' on niggas like I am army enlisted
You run up on me, you get it
My choppa retarded and spittin' on these goofy ass niggas
Pop a roofie, I'm gone, in a whole 'nother zone
Put my dick in yo mom, that's the shit that I'm on
Yeah, that's the shit that I'm on, you ain't on shit 'cause you dumb
You run up on me, you gone, that choppa on me, it's rung
You get hung like a noose
I'm about the war, give a fuck about the truce
All about myself, I give a fuck about you
Matter of fact, I may just shoot the fuck up out you
Put an X next to your name like Malcolm
I guess you didn't weigh your options out, your outcomes
You did the wrong shit on the right day
We turn a white day into a red day
Fuck what yo mom say, fuck what yo dad say
I keep it 3K like my first name Andre
If I go broke, I'm probably servin' like an entree
In Bombay with yo girl suckin' all on me
Off the Xannies, I'm a zombie
Don't believe me, try me, fuck around, stomp you
I'm kinda hungry off the weed, I may chomp you
And that shorty, she a eater, she a muncher
Man I'm feeling like a monster
Straight Jeffrey Dahmer when I'm grippin' the Llama
You don't want problems, no smoke at all
I take your whole pound and smoke it all
I take yo bitches then fuck 'em all
They on my D, I'm hatin', I duck 'em all
And she look at my whole team then suck 'em all
Macaroni on me, it'll buck-buck 'em all
Man somebody tell me to stop, nah, I'ma keep goin', just watch
I take yo Rollie, yo watch, yo bitches all on my cock
You run up on me, get popped, they judge a nigga like Cochran
They forgot to stop it, run up on me here
I got a rocket on me, no launcher
I feel like I am the bestest, I'm deadlier than asbestos
My word is really my weapon, I'm coming back for some seconds
Freestylin's a preference, send you to stairway to heaven
Man, these niggas writin' the shit that I say
The beats beat when I'm beatin' like Doctor the Dre
I pull up on them with the choppa, and screamin' out, "Hey!
Fuck you, pow pow, have a nice day"
And my wrist is like an ice tray, and yo bitch she do what I say
Yeah, she put her hands in the air when my song come on
Like single ladies and Beyonc, yeah
And the way that I spit shit
I burn niggas like Jamaicans with the incense
Been the realest with the shit ever since I was an infant
I'm a misfit, Tony Hawk on my grind like a trip tip, you could get hit
Choppa leave you cryin' like a chick flick, I'm a sick kid
Bitch, I been lit, man these niggas ain't shit but some pussies
And pork ass niggas, fuck is a piglet
Fuck is these niggas, I don't fuck with these niggas
A four-leaf clover on a bullet, good luck with these niggas
Man it must suck for these niggas, ol' sufferin' niggas
YouTube ol' video bufferin' niggas
Ol' big bad wolf huff-puffin' ass niggas
'Til I pull up on the scene like, "You think you hard?"
I put a bullet hole through your muffin ass, nigga
Man, all the songs that I'm bumpin', I got the partiers jumpin'
You run up on me, it's over, that chopper's on me, it's dumpin'
I'll dump you like a bad relationship, hold on, wait, wait, wait
Let me take this shit, it may take a bit
I spit the shit I say, go back, re-say it
Then say somethin' different, replacin' it, man they hatin' us
It's presidential brain from yo bitch Sarah Palin kid
Still sellin' John McCain, like you got yo shit snatched
My flow is off the chain, pull up in the rover, yeah, I got the range
I feel like Drake, nothing was the same
Niggas love to hate, get up out my face before you catch a AK
Shoot him in his face, tell that nigga bye-bye, man down, mayday
Pull up to his mom house and turn it to my safe place
I need a safe haven, I'm too busy slayin'
Dyin' my hair like Super Saiyans, leave his face on the pavement
Jackie Chan when I'm smokin', I really feel like an Asian
Fuck yo bitch when I'm high, call that shit Asian persuasion
I rush out with yo girl, she fuck for hours up in the shower
I feel like I got superpowers, I'm so superb
I'm 'bout the action, you niggas 'bout action verbs
I don't gotta say a word, I shoot for the green, feelin' like Larry Bird
On the competition, I drop and take a turd
Shove it in they ears, they hearin' every word
Really though, I get it poppin' like a nigga hittin' wheelies, ho
Or an ollie, ho, or a molly, ho
Run a train on yo bitch, that's a trolley, ho
Don't try me how I do you like Dej Loaf
You want to go to heaven so bad, here's a halo
My gun sing like J Lo, you better get low like limbo
Before you catch a couple shots for yo kinfolk
I'm Rambo with the ammo, I don't never let go
Money kinda stick to me, call me Juice Velcro
Say you gettin' money now, fuck nigga hell no
You don't like Adidas but this choppa give you shell toes
This choppa give you shell toes
And leave yo ass dancin' on the floor like a red nose
Beam on my gun, that's a red nose
Pull up on the scene, let the shit blow
Yonkers, Yonkers, in this bitch with Westwood, man

[Verse 4]
Yeah, let's do it, oof, got a lil' more bounce to it, don't it?
Uh, uh, I've been going through a lot as of lately
You can call me crazy
Bitches wanna play me
Really I got blueprints
Feelin' like I'm JAY-Z
My flow in the morning, Westwood no Sway B
That's just how it is, boy
My flow so brazy, my flow so cool
My flow so outdated, so old school
But then nigga switch it up to something so new
These niggas walking around like they bulletproof
'Til the bullets shoot, leave the bullets through his sunroof
Kill his son too
Give a fuck, oh, give a fuck
Nah, not what I do
I'm the type to pull up on your youth group
With a choppa and a machete, that's fuckin' useful
Matter of fact, here it go
I ain't the same nigga I was a year ago

I'm spittin' miracles, I'm in that white whip
What you call that shit? A miracle
Fuck yo bitch from the back singing negro spirituals
Got a seal, like fate, like a fuckin' envelope
I ain't dope, I'm anti-dope, word to Travis
You run up, that's okay, you gettin' played like Lenny Kravitz
I never had a father, like I said I'm such a bastard
You run up, uh, cool, I'ma let your brain splatter
The bullet rim rattle

But my flow is unmatched, my flow is outmatched
My flow is so hard, your flow is wack
My flow is so crack, your flow is so mid
My flow is so kill, your flow is so eh

Suck on my dick, tell your bitch to come over and swallow my kids
Choppa on my hip I had to hollow my tips
Hallowed be thy name, pray to catch his ass slippin'
Pull up on his ass leave him leakin' I get 'em
Walkin' with a limp .40 heavy like I'm pimpin'
Matter fact I have 'em dancin' when I shoot it crippin'
Niggas talkin' stupid 'til that nigga end up missin'

Takin' craps on all these niggas takin' naps on me

Couldn't believe 'em
Now I'm the type to beat the beat up 'til it's bleedin'
Choke it out 'til the mutha' fuckers barely breathin'
They ain't know a rockstar could rap like this
I'ma MC off the High-Tech mixed with High-C
You don't want that
Shoot you in your stomach that shit hard to digest
Make a art project out the projects
Shoot you in your eyes put the shit in prospect
Lookin' at your mindset, I'm beyond that

Beat him in his head until he catch a tumor
Tell his momma that I did it, she confused
"Why my baby all over the fuckin' news?"
"What the fuck my baby went and fuckin' did?"
He prolly went and fucked with Juice The Kid
That's my old name, now it's Juice WRLD
Went to a different planet
Now I'm up in two worlds
Fuck that shit I'm up in two girls
Diamonds and pearls, I'm ruling the world
Revenge on my body, bitch, 'cause that's my state of mind
Stevie Wonder like I said before 'cause I'ma rob you blind
I got all these answers that these niggas search to find
And they bitches kinda bad I'ma have to get behind
Hit it from the back until I fuckin' break her spine
After that I may just have to go and take what's mine
Yeah, yeah, turn on that Mob Deep shit

[Verse 5]
Uh-uh, uh, uh-uh, uh, oh
Ain't no such thing as halfway
Ain't no such thing as halfway
Ain't no such thing as halfway gangsters
You in them hallways, you ain't in the streets
Niggas really thinking that it's cool to make beef
And become enemies of enemies
How come all of my enemies was friends to me
How come all my enemies is frenemies
How come all my enemies is blind
I catch 'em lackin' and kill 'em before I read all they energy

[Verse 13]
Oh

Hopefully I'm finna meet these niggas up in heaven, uh
I feel like I'm lost in my mind sometimes, uh
I feel like I'm dropped like a dime sometimes, uh
I'm just trying to find out what's mine sometimes, uh
I'm just trying to find out what's mine sometimes, uh, ayy

Suicide if you try to take my drugs
Homicide, go on and hold my gun
Specify, all the lies you've told
Look at me, what am I on?
Percy, Molly, Xanny, all that shit, in one mix
I'm so high that I cannot remember to forget
Matter of fact, let's just take a sec
Rest in peace to the niggas that left
Rest in peace to the niggas that left
And praise all the niggas that's left
I feel like I'm up in my prime
But who am I gon' share my prime with?
Who am I gon' share my time with?
Sometimes it's just perfect timing
Singing like I'm CeCe Winans
Damn, this shit's unwinding
Yuh, yeah, yeah, ayy
Suicide if you try to take my drugs
Homicide if you try to rob my plug, ayy
Homicide if you try to take my gun

Everybody talking 'bout they numb or something, wait
Can you feel hell
All this fake shit around me is this some real hell?
All this sober shit around me is there some pills hell?
For real, I need to know
I need to know
My mama tell me that I need to let 'em go
She say the syrup in these pills finna kill me
But sometimes I think it brings out the real me
Sometimes I think it brings out the concealed me
Sometimes I think it exposes and reveals me
So what happens when the real meets the real
What happens when Juice meets the pills
Uh-uh-uh, yeah
Westwood shit

Run up on me, choppa make you sing like that
Make you march like Martin Luther King, in fact

I'm shittin' on these niggas, this is a excrement
I rapped on another beat that's some extra shit
You niggas gon' have to deal with the mess of it
I thought I told yo ass not to mess wit' it
I see this shit before I say it, telepathy
It's like I talk to my conscious, I say what it's tellin' me
Anything besides money, eh, it's kinda irrelevant
I can't focus without codeine, my medicine
I sip it until I'm slurrin' and spittin' impediments
I'm ballin' to the point where I think I need a Letterman
Westwood at the gates of London, he just had to let 'em in
I'm here, spazzin' on every single track he pass
You run up, I leave you leakin' on a maxi pad
I'm ballin', hard, these other niggas on the bench
I swear, they need to stay where they at
Nigga, I'm takin' over the world, a map for a map
I'm off of a ecstasy pill, that's a flat for a flat
I'm up to bat, throw a fastball, it's a hit
I hit a lick, then I hit a hit on yo bitch, I don't miss

Yo sins ain't forgivin'
I'm the rap God, call me Juice Allah
Did I take it too far?
Did I take two bars, to get on Mars?
To more like Dubai, hold on
I got a little tongue twisted, but I'm still gifted
Still spittin', still rippin' writtens
This premonition is really killin' it
And these niggas ain't shit
But Civics, me I'm Bentley
Get it, bitch

I sold my soul then bought it back, I finessed 'em, uh
You run up on me, choppa holy it'll bless 'em, uh
He talking stupid 'til they shoot him, that's my weapon, uh
I got a couple of bars I could spit
Maybe I'll just use 'em in this shit
Or maybe I'll just use 'em in a skit
My first guess, they wanted shit
My next project, it's gon' be harder
My arm in the rim, really, I feel like Vince Carter
I'm at yo head nigga, I feel like a barber
You on the bench nigga, and I am a starter

All the legends, where they at? They all die
Well, I don't wanna be a legend up in my prime
But, I know it's still prime time
Stars, how I shine
When they align with the planet, you know some shit is goin' on
I transform like Omegatron, when my favorite song is on
Fuckin' that bitch like the Ramadan
Man, I spit shit

Smokin' kush, this aroma, leave yo ass in a coma
Ballin' out like I'm Odom before the crack, don't you get it?
Spittin' crack on these niggas, define niggas like physics

Outer space I'm ballin' like I'm shootin' up on Pluto
Talkin' stupid to me 'til I pull up let the tool blow
Emperor new school, call me Juice Kuzco
Known to flip this shit and kick it like I'm knowing Judo
That's just how it goes though
If I touch the world I told you that shit is a snow globe
That's just how my flow is
Living in the moment
Your bitch swallow my kids

I can break it down, a million different phrases
Look at all my songs on the playlist
It's evident that I'm your bitches favorite

Doin' the best that I can for my niggas, yeah

I'm tryna buy Balenciagas, no posits
Buy it all, no deposits
If I need more cash, let's hit Chase then make a withdrawal
You know I got it
Interscope got me livin' a lil' proper
I'm hoping that I prosper
My gun is finna sing, that's an Opera
These niggas acting, I think they need a Oscar
Therapy or something, what's they problem?
I'm sick of being modest

Man, I rapped on like seventy beats
Niggas gon' go back and listen to me
Bitches prolly gon' get wet, damn near pissin' to me
On twitter, mentioning me wishing they were with me
Some niggas against me, some niggas don't get me
Some niggas won't hit me

Crash my whip, off the drugs, I'm swervin'

[Chorus]
Sticks and stones may break my bones
But the drugs won't hurt me, the drugs won't hurt me
Ex-girlfriend keeps calling my phone
But the bitch can't hurt me, so I'm not worried
All alone, did it on my own
So I show no mercy, I show no mercy
With my bros, but I got my pole screaming
"Please don't urge me, please don't urge me", yuh

Screaming, "Please don't urge me"
And fuck these hoes, all they do is irk me

"Please don't urge me, please don't urge me", yuh

[Outro]
Turned to a whole different person, drive my whip
Crash my whip, off the drugs, I'm swervin'[Intro: Juice WRLD]
Need a drink? (Hoo, ayy, ayy)

[Chorus: Juice WRLD]
Really think I found my home, shorty made me feel at home
She made me leave the thrills at home and I'm fine with it
She really made me lose control, I'ma let my love unfold
We're just two lost souls, but we're fine with it

[Verse 1: Juice WRLD]
There's love at my front door, short notice
She not like the sane girls, I noticed
Think I met my soulmate, yeah, I know it

You help me face my demons, I won't hide, hide
Girls like you are hard to find
I hope you don't mind, if I give you the time of your life, life, life

[Chorus: Juice WRLD]
Really think I found my home, shorty made me feel at home
She made me leave the thrills at home and I'm fine with it
She really made me lose control, I'ma let my love unfold
We're just two lost souls, but we're fine with it

[Verse 2: Seezyn]
Life is not the same with your pictures in my frame
Now that you're here, I want nothing to change
You pick me up when I'm down, I need you around
You seen me through my darkest times
Girl, is there something that you try to find?
You brought meaning to my life
All because of you, I do right
Because of you, I have a purpose
Fight for the world because you're worth it

[Chorus: Juice WRLD]
Really think I found my home, shorty made me feel at home

Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm holding my breath and watching my step
I'm listing regrets and you made that list
You're my depression
Your first impression was in deception, you were lyin'

[Chorus]
Bitch, I'm still flexin' with my heart broken
Got my heart open, I'm not high yet
Bitch, I'm still moving, I'm in slow motion
I rolled my dosage, I'm getting higher
Bitch, I still, I still love my pills, Advils
You can't feel, I feel, you can't feel, I feel
Bitch, I still, I still love my pills, Advils
You can't feel, I feel, you can't feel, I feel

[Post-Chorus]
Oh, ooh, woah, oh, oh, oh-oh, oh
Oh, ooh, woah, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh-ah

[Verse]
*exhaling*
Fell in love with your face off the shrooms
The way it animates your eyes in the room
I can see the stars when I'm gazing at you
Now I need the car with the stars in the roof, ooh
Elephant all in the room, she buried me in a tomb
I'm feeling over consumed
She walking me to my doom, I see her face in my room
When I'm alone in the room, I'ma blame that on the shrooms

[Bridge]
Oh, feeling ridiculed, feeling like a fool, don't know what to do
Lost my heart, don't got shit to lose

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm holding my breath and watching my step
I'm listing regrets and you made that list
You're my depression
Your first impression wasn't deception, you were lyin'

[Chorus]
Bitch, I'm still flexin' with my heart broken
Got my heart open, I'm not high yet
Bitch, I'm still moving, I'm in slow motion
I rolled my dosage, I'm getting higher
Bitch, I still, I still love my pills, Advils
You can't feel, I feel, you can't feel, I feel
Bitch, I still, I still love my pills, Advils
You can't feel, I feel, you can't feel, I feel

And we live
And we recording
And there's lean on deck, y'know?
Purple Rain
Okay, so

[Chorus]
I just popped a bean yesterday, it was a long night
I done did the right drugs, only on the wrong night
I was rocking Off-White, tryna have a fun time
She gon' eat like lunch time, molly got her on time
Fuck niggas don't get respect, but I'ma die about mine
Swervo told me stop popping them Xannies 'fore I flatline
I said hold on, bro wait, I'ma be fine
I said hold on, bro wait, I'ma be fine
I said hold on, bro wait, I'ma be fine
I said hold on, bro wait, I'ma be fine
I said hold on, bro wait, I'ma be fine
I'ma be fine, I'ma be fine

[Verse 1]
But in the meantime, bitch, it's lean time
Pop a bean time 'cause it ain't killing me
My lil' bro keep a .40, they thought his ass was security
Too busy making money to worry 'bout making memories
But in the meantime, bitch, it's green time
Maybe lean time, outta energy
My momma told me, "Stop the painkillers"
Them shits is killing me, I'ma be fine

[Chorus]
I just popped a bean yesterday, it was a long night
I done did the right drugs, only on the wrong night
I was rocking Off-White, tryna have a fun time
She gon' eat like lunchtime, molly got her on time
Fuck niggas don't get respect, but I'ma die about mine
Swervo told me stop popping them Xannies 'fore I flatline
I said hold on, bro wait
I'ma be fine, I'ma be fine, I'ma be fine

[Verse 2]
They know my name hold weight
Put it in her mouth just like Colgate
Get outta line and you get punched in your face
Shouldn't have been around here in the first place
Now you got a black eye
I got mob ties, I got gang ties
Make you drown in your blood, just like high tide
Now I'm up, everybody wanna high five
Remember when they used to diss me in the lunch line
Now I'm eating steak and eggs when it's lunchtime
I remember eating Ramen with a Glock .9
I remember when she left me for the next guy
Now she calling me her next guy

[Chorus]
I just popped a bean yesterday, it was a long night
I done did the right drugs, only on the wrong night
I was rocking Off-White, tryna have a fun time
She gon' eat like lunch time, molly got her on time
Fuck niggas don't get respect, but I'ma die about mine
Swervo told me stop popping them Xannies 'fore I flatline
I said hold on, bro wait, I'ma be fine
I said hold on, bro wait, I'ma be fine
I said hold on, bro wait, I'ma be fine
I said hold on, bro wait, I'ma be fine
I said hold on, bro wait, I'ma be fine
I'ma be fine, I'ma be fine

[Outro]
I woke up Xanning
I sit down, I can't stand it anymore
Can't stand it anymore, more
I woke up leaning, so I woke up dreaming
And fiending for more, for more, for more
One cup, I need four more, hey
I woke up leaning, so I woke up dreaming
And fiending for more, for more, for more
One cup, I need four more, hey[Intro]
Vibe on this bitch, though
A lighter?
Nah, in the room
Oh
Uh-huh

[Verse 1]
You work numbers, work wonders
You done woke me up from my eternal slumber
I'm the lightning, youre the thunder
There's a difference 'tween, "I need you," and, "I want you"
Girl, I need you
Good sex led to conversations getting a little deeper, uh
Tell me your darkest secrets, shit you wouldnt even tell Jesus, uh
My karma been tweaking so much, I don't even believe in karma
But you give me a reason to thank God for all these recent falls
Percocet 30 E 8, I've been gettin' off
I done chilled out on the drugs since you've been involved
Suck it like it's love, fuck me like it's love
No protection on my heart, goddamnit, I'm gon hit it raw
Traumatized from my past, yeah, I keep a log
In my mind, in my head, where that shit belong
They say you after my bread, shit, I hope they wrong
You already ran up the bands, we could have a ball
Hit it from the back, humina, call a play, huddle up
This that good love in the bedroom
Fuck you in the Prada, poke her face like Lady Gaga
Ride it like a Mazda, zoom, zoom, zoom

[Chorus]
Im all, I'm really all in
In love with all your flaws and sins
Your scars are really gorgeous
Aint that a weird way to give compliments?
I'm all, I'm really all in
I fell in love with all your flaws and sins
Your scars are really gorgeous
I see your light in all the darkness

[Verse 2]
Woah
'Atta boy, I done turned to a man
Hot chills when my skin is on your skin
Hope you know that if you ever try to end
You gon catch a couple out the F&N
That mean Cupid ain't give you a headshot
So I ain't got no choice but to leave you with a headshot
Look at the way I make that fucking bed rock, uh
Where your ring finger at? I need wedlock
Got my sights on your ass, ooh, red dot
We some bats that made it out of Hell, ooh, red hot
Don't, ayy, go all night, bitch, don't stop
We ain't even gon' be finished 'til the sun's up

[Chorus]
I'm all, I'm really all in
In love with all your flaws and sins
Your scars are really gorgeous
Ain't that a weird way of giving compliments?
I'm all, I'm really all in
In love with all your flaws and sins
Your scars are really gorgeous
That's my way of giving compliments
I'm all, I'm really all in
In love with all your flaws and sins
Your scars are really gorgeous
Ain't that a weird way to give compliments?
I'm all, I'm really all in
I fell in love with all your flaws and sins
Your scars are really gorgeous
I see light in all the darkness[Intro: Shiloh Dynasty & Juice WRLD]
Father forgive me, for you know that I'm always sinning
And I (And I), and I (And I), mhm (Mhm), mhm
I take no interest partying with liquor, fucking up my system
Excuse my language that's a hang up on how shitty I been feeling
And I (And I) told (Told), uh
I'm sorry I feel no attraction, I know that it's been a minute
And I, and I, and I, and I, survived the night
Father forgive me, for you know that I'm always sinning
I take no interest partying with liquor, fucking up my system
Why'd you lie?
Excuse my language that's a hang up on how shitty I been feeling
Realize, realize, realize, this life (This life, this life, this life)
I'm sorry I feel no attraction, I know that it's been a minute

Realize your dark side collides inside
You run as fast as you can but you can't hide
Realize your dark side collides inside
You run as fast as you can

In her soul, dark and light fight for the control
Nobody knows
In her soul, dark and light fight for the control
Don't anyone know, don't anyone know

[Verse: Juice WRLD]
Money is happiness, cap
Bitches got faithfulness, cap
And drugs only make it worse, cap
I take a perc, then I take me a nap
Take a sip of the syrup so I could go relax
Bitch, I'm ready for war when the demons attack
Hell yeah, believe that

[Pre-Chorus: Juice WRLD]
One to the face, don't fuckin' hesitate
I'm high as Heaven gates
Ain't no comin' down, comin' down

Ain't no comin' down, comin' down (Down, down, down)
Bitch, I'm high as Heaven gates
Ain't no comin' down, comin' down (Realize)
Bitch, I'm high as Heaven gates
Ain't no comin' down, comin' down

[Chorus: Juice WRLD]
Realize your dark side collides inside
You run as fast as you can but you can't hide
Realize your dark side collides inside
You run as fast as you can
Realize your dark side collides inside
You run as fast as you can but you can't hide
Realize your dark side collides inside
You run as fast as you can

Disregard civilians
Until I get a house with a moat and a pavilion

[Verse 1]
I reek of good vibes
Smokin' on reefer, I'm high
Percocet fever
The type of pill to make you scratch until your nails gone (Yeah, yeah)
Drugs in my head, you heard what I said
No five, no ten, no fifteen, twenty, just Perc-30's in my meds
I told my mama I'm here to stay, no, she won't catch me dead
I'm too much of an idol, nigga, no Ryan Seacrest
Do it by my V-lone, 'lone

Alone, alone, alone (Slatt)

Disregard civilians
Until I get a house with a moat and a pavilion

[Verse 2]
'Til I get a house with a moat and a pavilion
Walked into your building, nigga, I'm a villain
Feel like Dragon Ball, bitch, I'm Goku and you Krillin
Bickin' back, I'm boolin', these niggas be chillin'
All up in they feelings, me, I'm just winning
W-I-N-N-I-N-G (Spell it)
Boy, it's ain't no "I" in team but it's an "M-E" in team (Fuck)

I know I just fucked up, but bitch, I'm still the freestyle king, whoa
Her pussy wetter than olive oil, my watch cost a hundred more
My new girl a Lamborghin', your girl a Honda Accord
Mama told me I gotta stay focused, told her I am not a Ford
Focused, you notice when it disappear like hocus pocus

Percs help me feel it, I feel it, uh

Ooh

She told me that it's all my fault
It woulda been a right and not another wrong (Huh)

[Chorus]
She told me that it's all my fault, it woulda been perfect all along
It woulda been a right and not another wrong
And it would be a happy not a sad song, oh
'Cause it's all my fault, she would have been perfect on her own
I should have took a right but I took a wrong
And now this ain't a happy, it's a sad song, oh

[Verse]
She like a mouse in a mouse trap, stuck up
She got me rolling weed now, I'm fucked up
You talking too much, so shut the fuck up
You heated too much, you're high, the summer
I'll let you cool down
And I brought you 'round momma
But you let me down, yeah, you let me drown in drama
You talking too much, so shut the fuck up
You talking too much, so shut the fuck up

Stuck in a maze
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Stuck in a maze, mmh

[Chorus]
Stuck in a maze
Everything's okay but it's not really okay
My life's a death race
I'm numbing my pain with codeine rain
I'm going insane
Life's not the same
Stuck in a maze
I'm not going in
My brain is going everywhere
I'm tormented every day
Mama, I'm losing my mental
The sorrows that I've been through
Story to be continued

[Verse]
I sip ill, pop pills, crack seals
Doing anything to numb the weight that I feel, yeah
I chase thrills, you still crashin' Hot Wheels
Ride a dirt bike down the ditch, see if I live
I'm not in my subconscious, I'm conscious
They tell me that they can help me, I got this
Watch this, I took my demons into the bank of life and I made the biggest deposit
Without drugs, I'm losing my logic
These pills and my Pro Tools still got logic
I run, I run, I run
I run, I run, I run

[Chorus]
Stuck in a maze
Everything's okay but it's not really okay
My life's a death race
I'm numbing my pain with codeine rain

I'm not going in
My brain is going everywhere
I'm tormented every day
Mama, I'm losing my mental
The sorrows that I've been through
Story to be continued[Intro]
I figured she was gonna break my heart regardless, regardless
I figured she was gonna break my heart regardless
So I took her out and dumped her in the garbage
The stupid bitch done turned herself into a target
Click, clack

[Chorus]
She was gonna break my heart regardless
So I took her out and dumped her in the garbage
Stupid bitch done turned herself into a target (Yeah)
Just for talkin' nonsense, claiming she was leavin'

[Verse 1]
Not gonna happen
If I can't have you, no one can
'Cause if you leave, I'm not breathin'
I'll show you how it feels not to breathe, breathe
Inhale, exhale
You're the best, well
You're the worst, but
You're the best, hell
I ain't ever, ever gonna lose, lose
Tell me what I gotta do to prove to you
Five seconds from losing my head
Now it's time to show you what lunatics do

[Chorus]
She was gonna break my heart regardless
So I took her out and dumped her in the garbage
The stupid bitch done turned herself into a target (Yeah)
Just for talkin' nonsense, claiming she was leavin'
I figured she was gonna break my heart regardless
So I took her out and dumped her in the garbage
The stupid bitch done turned herself into a target (Yeah)
Just for talkin' nonsense, claiming she was leavin'

[Verse 2]
Hate it when you tease
Where you think you're goin'? When you comin' back from me?
You walked in, I'm listening to "Stan" on E, yeah, ecstasy
Matter of fact there's a bridge that my car wants to meet
Road trip on me, it'll be fun, you'll see
But you don't gotta sit in the trunk, you can sit next to me
Me and Stan, we alike, but he ain't nicer than me
He was drunk drivin', me, I'm just straight Perc-ules

[Outro]
My crazy thoughts and your crazy heart
'Cause we hit the bridge, that's just the start
Not afraid to die, as you can see
Life isn't real, love's make believe
My crazy thoughts and your crazy heart
'Cause we hit the bridge, that's just the start
Not afraid to die, as you can see
Life isn't real, love's make believe[Intro]
Ooh

[Verse 1]
We ain't gon' do this, not again
Gucci cardigan, I'm the flyest gent
I found out what the problem is, breakin' promises
It was the both of us

[Refrain]
Oh, all girls the same, same, same
Two blue pills to the brain, brain, brain
Yeah, I kinda miss your brain
And I bet you miss my fame

She know me well, well, well, she know me well (Uh-huh)
Told me she loved me still, bitch, go to hell (Uh-huh)
All the drugs I did, it was worth it (Yeah)

Tell me why you had me feelin' worthless (Yeah)
Now your heart broken, you need a surgeon (Yeah)
I know one thing for sure, one thing for certain (Yeah)
I know one thing's for sure, one thing's for certain (Yeah, yeah, yeah)

[Verse 2]
I bet I'll never die again
Bullets fly again, Cupid hit his target
Guess he's been target practicing
Devils panickin', it makes it worse for my heart

[Refrain]
Oh, girls aren't the same, same, same
But it's still two pills to the brain, brain, brain
I hope you never change, change, change
I also hope we put the drugs away

[Bridge]
Well, well, well, well
She do me well
I hope she loves me for real
'Cause I been through hell
All the drugs I did
They weren't worth it, now I'm worthless
I hope my new lady thinks I'm perfect, oh
Sometimes I feel like that she'll be better off
Without me but without her I would die, oh
I would die, oh

[Chorus]
She know me well, well, well, she know me well (Uh-huh)
Told me she loved me still, bitch, go to hell (Uh-huh)
All the drugs I did, it was worth it (Yeah)
Super worth it (Uh)
Tell me why you had me feelin' worthless (Yeah)
Now your heart broken, you need a surgeon (Yeah)

Why you mad, why you mad?
Why you mad, why you mad?
That is all I wanna know
You're lookin' like a joke, dry humor at the most
Steady chokin' on your shade like a dick in your throat
Well if you're gonna throw shade my way
Maybe you should throw with a little more aim
It's a cold day in hell when they dirty up your name
They don't got no business talkin' in the first place, I'm freezin'
(Freezin', bitch I'm freezin', freezin', freezin', freezin', freezin')

[Chorus]
All these fuck niggas on my line
Damn nigga you must wanna die tonight
Yeah, I rock a choker with a .45
And I know some niggas that are down to ride
All these hatin' bitches on my line
Damn bitch you must wanna fuck tonight
Let me guess, you're my biggest fan, right?
You wanted an autograph
All you had to do was ask, woah (Huh)

[Verse 1]
But you lookin' like an asshole
Up on Twitter and you lookin' mad, woah
Talkin' bout me, but you lookin' bad, woah
Like the ugly daughter that I never had, woah
And what's up with these niggas?
Got my name in they mouth like they swallowin' my children
I never got why niggas hate
It's probably cause I'm doin' better than them anyway
It's probably cause I get they bitches wetter anyway
It's probably cause I'm livin' and they're in a lower place
They walkin' in the slums while I'm vibin' out in space
Crash land just to take they girl on a dinner date
When haters see me winnin' they just hyperventilate
They always try to stop me but I never hesitate
Just follow all your dreams and when you reach them, celebrate
That's the only way to truly make a hater suffocate

[Chorus]
All these fuck niggas on my line
Damn nigga you must wanna die tonight
Yeah, I rock a choker with a .45
And I know some niggas that are down to ride
All these hatin' bitches on my line
Damn bitch you must wanna fuck tonight
Let me guess, you're my biggest fan, right?
You wanted an autograph
All you had to do was ask, woah

Why you mad, why you mad?
Why you mad, why you mad?
That's all I wanna know
You're lookin' like a joke, dry humor at the most

Well if you're gonna throw shade my way
Maybe you should throw with a little more aim
It's a cold day in hell when they dirty up your name
They don't got no business talkin' in the first place, I'm freezin'
But these haters not breathin'
Stevie Wonder to these haters no seein'
And I don't believe it
They hate me, hate me for no reason
They hate me for no reason, woah
Oh-oh-oh

[Chorus]
All these fuck niggas on my line
Damn nigga you must wanna die tonight
Yeah, I rock a choker with a .45

This is as far as it goes
This the end of the road
This the end of the rope
The other end at her throat
It's suicidal she wrote
This is the end of the show, it's over
We doin' drugs 'til we in a coma

[Verse 1]
We don't love these hoes, our hearts got colder
It's hard out here for a lonely stoner
I know I'm doing drugs, but so what?
Just pray to God I never throw up
I pray to God my plug, I blow up
I pray to God my plug still show up
I know the last time, we tried to rob him
He lucky, bro'nem ain't fucking off him
I'm drinking, driving in the Bentley coupe, so
It's hard for me to drive, I move too slow
I told you, baby, I ain't saving no hoe
I only save the money; antihero
I burned my old clothes and got some new clothes
I left my old hoes and got some new hoes
My brother got a chopper and it's kickin' like Judo
He shootin' while I'm drivin' the two-door

[Chorus]
This is as far as it goes
This the end of the road
This the end of the rope
The other end at her throat
It's suicidal she wrote
This is the end of the show, it's over
We doin' drugs 'til we in a coma
This is as far as it goes
This the end of the road
This the end of the rope
The other end at her throat
It's suicidal she wrote
This is the end of the show, it's over
We doin' drugs 'til we in a coma

[Verse 2]
I'm smokin' dope 'til I'm in a coma
The moon rock on me, I love the aroma
I get so high that I'm in the clouds with the fallen angels
Demons with halos
She love the coke, but not Coca-Cola
But she'll still pop it like a soda for ya
Her name rings bells like a Motorola
I lay the bitch off like I'm her employer
And she gon' ride like a roller coaster
And I'm gon' hide when the love is over
But it's far from over, losing composure
In a coffin, laying stiff like a boulder

[Chorus]
This is as far as it goes
This the end of the road
This the end of the rope
The other end of her throat
It's suicidal she wrote
This is the end of the show, it's over
We doin' drugs 'til we in a coma
This is as far as it goes
This the end of the road
This the end of the rope
The other end at her throat
It's suicidal she wrote
This is the end of the show, it's over
We doin' drugs 'til we in a coma[Intro]
Another life
Another day, another blunt
Another day, another lie, blunt
Another night, another day, another night, another...

Another life, another day, another chance to make it great
I'm running to the money all the time so I can never be late
Just me and my bitch, even though she drive me crazy, she still make my day

Going through motions, muddy emotions
Going through motions, muddy emotions
Going through motions, muddy emotions
Back on my bullshit, devil emoji
Going through motions, muddy emotions
Going through motions, muddy emotions
Going through motions, muddy emotions
Back on my bullshit, devil emoji

[Verse 2]
Boat rocking back and forth, what's the commotion?
I told her I'ma drown in her, that bitch an ocean
If I can't make her smile, I'ma be acting wild
She got a new man, I'm gon' pull up on him and shoot him down
I been goin' through emotions, bloody emotions
Pour me a cup, I'ma nod out
Started pack smokin', good dope rollin'
Maybe Mary Jane'll help me put the pills down
Dead inside, catch a look at my ghost
I pull up in a Lambo' or 'Rari or Rolls
Got my girl by my side and they callin' us goals
Numb the pain, take these Percs to the mouth and the nose
I'm not a drug addict, got it all wrong
I'm just a love addict 'til my heart gone
I'm just a love addict with the love songs
You with me is where you belong

[Chorus]
Going through motions, muddy emotions
Going through motions, muddy emotions
Going through motions, muddy emotions
Back on my bullshit, devil emoji
Going through motions, muddy emotions
Going through motions, muddy emotions
Going through motions, muddy emotions
Back on my bullshit, devil emoji

Can't disappear and re-appear in the same sentence, I'm bad at it
The Mad Hatter, the Perc packer
The mom thrasher
The Perc mixed with the syrup turn me into a contractor
A straight tweak, so high I can't speak
Been three weeks, I still haven't met my peak
Like I could be someone other than myself
Like I could find a little Heaven up in my Hell
Yeah I know it never ever end well
Yeah I know I always fall victim to a rich spell
Uh, like abracadabra
The flow so raw, forgot to grab Magnums
Been raw-doggin' bitches ever since I went platinum
I feel like Hell full of bad bitches
Wonder if it's room in Heaven for savages
My life's a canvas, I'm paintin' in blood like a cannibal
Rip off his head and I salvage it, huh
A little too graphic
At least you niggas know that I still got the passion
Of someone who don't got shit, but the clothes on they back
And its been that way since way back since
Like I'm a killer or somethin'
These niggas lip-singin' like Milli Vanilli or somethin'
I'm like Lil' Wayne I got a milli-milli-milli or somethin'
I guess, I'm rich, in broke pockets
Bountiful, my soul's empty, so deep, ten feet

[Interlude: Juice WRLD]
Times ten feet
Fuck love, it's gon' take more to convince me, that you with me
And not against me
Where I'm from we loaded up
Pop out and turn niggas into mince meat

[Outro: T-Pain]

Left her makeup and her panties on my bedroom dresser
Think about the days when I used to undress her

[Chorus]
Long gone, long gone, long gone (Ayy)
Long gone, long gone, long gone (Ayy)
Long gone, long gone, long gone
Long gone (Yeah, ayy)

[Verse 1]
Sorrow and sadness next to me
Old hoes see that I'm on, so they textin' me
Ex-bitch tryna finesse me, she won't get a damn thing
Listen to my story, it's depressing
Heartbreak mixed with the drugs, not the best ending
The devil tryna test me I'm failing, inhaling
You took it all back
All that heartbreak, that was a year ago
Wanted you back, so bad, but that's...

[Chorus]
Long gone, long gone, long gone (Ayy)
Long gone, long gone, long gone (Ayy)
Long gone, long gone, long gone
Long gone

[Bridge]
What you don't seem to understand is
You really took my love for granted
You really had me feeling helpless, that's so selfish

[Verse 2]
Haven't been in love in a long while
Wait until my next girl finds out
Then I'm scared we gon' break up and fall out
Drownin' in my thoughts, baby, looking for a lighthouse
Ain't no sleep, I've been feeling like a night owl
Music turnt up, neighbors telling me to pipe down
On the other hand, I think I found my future wife
But she not here with me, so it get lonely at night, ayy

[Pre-Chorus]
I hope, her love doesn't go away
I hope this ain't a phase
One more heartbreak and I'll be...

Long gone, long gone, long gone (Ayy)
Long gone, long gone, long gone (Ayy)
Long gone, long gone, long gone
Long gone
Long gone, long gone, long gone (Ayy)
Long gone, long gone, long gone (Ayy)
Long gone, long gone, long gone
Long gone

Leave her in the past, but I know I'll miss her
I kept all of her paraphernalia
Left her makeup and her panties on my bedroom dresser
Think about the days when I used to undress her[Chorus]
Her face ain't ever matching her persona, yeah
I mix Xanax with the strongest marijuana, yeah
You want problems? I roll with the problem solvers, yeah
I got six shots in this gun, it's a revolver, yeah
Dye my hair on that bullshit, like Rodman
I'm like Jordan, you ball like Craig Hodges, yeah
Feel like Drake 'cause I started from the bottom
I keep two Magnums, a gun and a condom

[Verse 1]
Wait wait they tryna set me up, huh
But they can't set me up, huh

Pull up to his block and I wet it up
I'm on the ground off the Xanax and Perkys
I need me a pick me up, huh
I got so drunk last night bro had to come pick me up, yeah
Swerve on a highway huh, living the high way, huh
She fuck her friend for the night, huh
She go the bi way, huh
She got the Molly and champagne
Told her to bring that shit my way, huh
We couldn't make it into the house
She sucked me in the driveway, huh
I never gave her the runaround
I'ma always keep a gun around
Heat on my hip like the sun around
Ball like the OKC Thunder round
Hennessy, I need a couple rounds
Moving no work I got hella pounds
Fuck up a check, I got hella bands
Bandana on me like Taliban
Motorola, Motorola 'cause I love my trap phone
Feel like Batman when I'm robbin' 'cause I keep a bat phone
I've been trapping in the basement even when my mom home
Sorry, mama, but I gotta keep the fucking lights on, ayy

[Chorus]
Her face ain't ever matching her persona, yeah
I mix Xanax with the strongest marijuana, yeah
You want problems? I roll with the problem solvers, yeah

[Verse 2]
I keep two guns, I keep two cups
I had to lose her, it was too much to say I don't care
Could give two fucks
Remember when she topped me on my tour bus
Throw 'Xannys in the crowd to make the tour bus
She got a model body, that bitch gorgeous
We run up in your spot and shoot from the floor up
Now you tore up, bitch you tore up, ayy

[Chorus]
Her face ain't ever matching her persona, yeah
I mix Xanax with the strongest marijuana, yeah
You want problems? I roll with the problem solvers, yeah
I got six shots in this gun, it's a revolver, yeah
Dye my hair on that bullshit, like Rodman
I'm like Jordan, you ball like Craig Hodges, yeah
Feel like Drake 'cause I started from the bottom
I keep two Magnums, a gun and a condom[Verse 1: Kehlani]
You so damn important
Everything you do shows me you know it
Behind it all you are the motive
Dont tell you enough, but baby I'll show it, show it
He say the king where he come from
Take a young queen just to know one
So, baby, Ima drive it like its stolen
Ima fix it like its broken
We could catch a flight out to London
Go to the mall, spend a lump sum
They could try to catch up to us
But theyre too busy making assumptions

[Bridge: Kehlani]
Boy, you know all I do
Is stay up all night losing sleep over you
All I do
Is drive myself crazy thinkin' 'bout my

[Verse 2: Chance The Rapper]
She said, "I aint even make my bed up"
"Watch your step, you gon wake my mama and dad up"
Pssh, girl, didnt I tell you at the damn club?
We gon wake your neighbors
Turn your block club to my fan club
And that happen so fast
Damn, I'm glad I strapped up
Ask her when she finish, if she came
She said I lapped ya twice
Run it back for the dub, rematch
Flip the crib when we fuck, RE/MAX
It get hot than a mug, glass cup
You can ask her if I fuck, she gassed, huh
I gotta keep it a secret, I keep a key in my lower pocket
Inside a register below the lower octave
Dirty laundry in my closet, they be strung out on the street
Left to dry with drawers, sheets and no deposit
But I dont gotta worry, put my hand on your mouth
Put my hands in your mouth, girl
We got plans at my house, you know the way up

[Hook: Kehlani]
Its the way you walk, the way you talk, babe
Its the way you love, the way you fuck, the way
Its the way you are, you're a star, babe

[Verse 3: Kehlani]
This thing we got is crazy
Only thing I know is youre my baby
Forever down, I am your lady
Always for sure, never a maybe
Never met someone who spoke my language
Never met a nigga done with playin
You the type of nigga make me lane switch
Hand me the brush and say paint it
Give me your heart and I hold it
Show me your soul and I'll mold it
Baby boy, you gotta be the dopest
Gotta be to fuck with the coldest

[Bridge: Kehlani]
Boy, you know all I do
Is stay up all night losing sleep over you
All I do

I need a gangsta
To love me better
Than all the others do
To always forgive me
Ride or die with me
That's just what gangsters do

[Verse 1]
I'm fucked up, I'm black and blue

That nobody, nobody, nobody knows

Got me up so high I'm barely breathing
So don't let me, don't let me, dont let me, don't let me go

[Hook]
I need a gangsta
To love me better

To always forgive me

I like my girls just like I like my honey; sweet
A little selfish

A little jealous
'Cause I'm a beautiful wreck
A colorful mess, but I'm funny
Oh, I'm a heartbreak vet
With a stone-cold neck, yeah, I'm charming

[Refrain]
All the pretty girls in the world
But I'm in this space with you
Colored out the lines
I came to find, my fire was fate with you
Heartache would stay with you
Fly great escapes with you

[Verse]
I countdown to the clock, saw you awake
Don't walk away, or would you wait for me?
I go out to the bar, fuck hangin' with the stars
Don't even have a car, but you would wait for me

[Refrain]
All, all, all, all the pretty girls in the world
But I'm in this space with you
Colored out the lines
I came to find, my fire was fate with you
My heartache would stay with you
Escape with you

[Chorus]
I like my girls just like I like my honey; sweet
A little selfish, huh
I like my women like I like my money; green
A little jealous
Oh, I'm a beautiful wreck
A colorful mess, but I'm funny
Oh, I'm a heartbreak vet
With a stone-cold neck, I'm so charming, oh, oh

You act like you need remindin'
Tryna do it over, bring it back and rewind it
But all that glitters isn't gold, I was blinded
Should have never gave you my heart on consignment

[Pre-Chorus: Kehlani]
And I can't believe the lies that I went for
Thought you was mine, but you decided to be with him though
You took my feelings and just threw 'em out the window
Feel like it's too hard to fall in love again, no

[Chorus: Kehlani]
On some nights like this, shawty, I can't help but think of us
I've been reminiscin', sippin', missin' ya
Can you tell me what's with all this distant love?
If I called, would you pick it up?
On some nights like this, I just wanna text you, but for what?
You gon' say you want me, then go switch it up
Just gon' play with my emotions just because, no (Oh)

[Verse 2: Kehlani]
All them times I played the fool for you
Thinkin' we could put it back together, thought we had forever
You never see my point of view
Our connection is so severed, you don't show no effort

[Pre-Chorus: Kehlani]
And I can't believe the lies that I went for
Thought you was mine, but you decided to be with him though
Took my feelings and just threw 'em out the window
Feel like it's too hard to fall in love again, no

[Chorus: Kehlani]
On some nights like this, shawty, I can't help but think of us
I've been reminiscin', sippin', missin' ya
Can you tell me what's with all this distant love?

You gon' get my hopes high, girl
You gon' get my hopes high, girl
Just gon' tell me more lies, girl
Just gon' get my hopes high, girl

[Verse 3: Ty Dolla $ign]
I've been way too good to you, you take me for granted
You was my day one since back at Big B's house on Adams
First day that we met, I flagged you down, I told you, "Hit my line"
Used to promise me you'd never switch on me like Gemini
You think I'm a fool, ain't nobody stupid
I see all the signs, I see all the clues
Yeah, sometimes I reminisce 'bout that shit when I'm bingin'
Can't believe it's been a whole year, yeah, but...

[Chorus: Kehlani with Ty Dolla $ign]
On some nights like this, shawty, I can't help but think of us
I've been reminiscin', sippin', missin' ya (Missin' ya)

We could agree to work it out like this

[Pre-Chorus]
I need you (you, oh) to give me your time (give me your time)

I'm looking right at you, but you're not there
I'm seeing right past you, but you seem well aware
Your body is here but your mind is somewhere else
So far gone and you think I can't tell
Can't tell that you are disconnected
You pulled away and I miss your presence
I always said to you

[Chorus]
Baby you should be here, right here
Baby you should be here, right here
Don't know where you went but you're lost now
Don't know where you went but you're gone now
Don't know where you went but you're lost now
Don't know where you went but you're gone now

[Verse 2]
Head on your chest babe, but your heart is so quiet
We use to talk all night long, now we laying in silence
Your arms around me but your soul is somewhere else
Gone so long and I know you so well
I know that you are everything that I ever dreamed of
And hoped that love had a happy ending

[Chorus]
Baby you should be here, right here
Baby you should be here, right here
Don't know where you went but you're lost now
Don't know where you went but you're gone now
Don't know where you went but you're lost now
Don't know where you went but you're gone now
You should be here, right here yeah[Verse 1]
I can hear your laugh, it's ringing through the hallways
I can see your smile, it's what gets me through my hard days
And your words were supposed to get me
Through my heartache, before my heartbreak
There's an emptiness that only few ever feel
And I somehow missed the meaning of love that is real
And it compliments my scars that will never heal

[Chorus]
Maybe I didn't deserve you
Maybe I just couldn't cure you
They told me that I didn't hurt you
Why do I feel like I turned you?
Maybe I don't understand it
Tell me is this how you planned it?
Did you see us so stranded
Maybe I'm too much to manage

[Verse 2]
And if you weren't gonna guide me
Why bring me into the light?
Must have done something
To make you want to run and hide
Why oh why didn't you just live your life?
And every girl needs a mother
And damn it I needed you
Instead you duck for cover
And you ran from the truth
And like kids do, you waited around for proof

[Chorus]
Maybe I didn't deserve you
Maybe I just couldn't cure you
They told me that I didn't hurt you
Why do I feel like I turned you?
Maybe I don't understand it
Tell me is this how you planned it?
Did you see us so stranded
Maybe I'm too much to manage

[Outro]
Maybe I didn't deserve you...[Verse 1]
I'm young, I be sprung and
Sometimes it's just so damn fast
I'm not dumb, no I'm not dumb
I know exactly what went wrong in my past
So caught up, in what I thought it all should be
I'm locked up, so tired of losing parts of me
To all these niggas

[Chorus]
Niggas gon' always be niggas
Can't afford to give my heart to these niggas
Ain't got time to lose my mind to these niggas

[Verse 2]
I'm not yours, never was and
I really just can't be mad
I'm the one, I know, I'm the one
And I'm completely fine with everything that I am
Too damn strong
To let you get the best of me
Took way too long
To find the light inside of me
Fuck all these niggas

[Chorus]
Niggas gon' always be niggas
Can't afford to give my heart to these niggas
Ain't got time to lose my mind to these niggas

[Verse 3]
Niggas, niggas gon' be niggas
Walkin' 'round so small but actin' like they're bigger
Actin' so damn bitter, lettin' go of their temper
I ain't got the time so I'll crop that ass out that picture
I'd be mad if I stayed true, it ain't in me to play you
If I took you down, yeah you can't talk shit cause I fed you
You was lost and I led you
A part of me, boy I bled you
Thought you was the one
But you actin' like one of these niggas

[Chorus]
Niggas gon' always be niggas
Can't afford to give my heart to these niggas
Ain't got time to lose my mind to these niggas[Verse 1: Kehlani]
Best friends and lovers
Can't seem to draw the line between each other
What is defined means nothing to a brother
You just don't give a damn, that's why I think I love ya
It's not fair, how easy I melt when you play with my hair
I ain't going nowhere, it's not right
I can't sleep without you anymore at night time
Not in this lifetime

[Hook 1: Kehlani]
Love ain't never been so close, but so far away
Like your mind is telling you to just back off
And your heart says just stay
What's a love that doesn't keep you up all night and all day
If it's not too late, yeah you realise it one day
We can go to the movies boy, maybe we could hang out boy
Whatever you wanna do, cause I'm down for it
I'm down for you

[Verse 2: BJ the Chicago Kid]
One day we're lovers, next day we're friends
Don't know where it begins or it ends
But let me tell you one thing going through a nigga's head
Most nigga's just scared
It feels too good to be true
Every time I'm with you
I'm ignoring what I'm next to

[Hook 2: BJ the Chicago Kid]
Cause love ain't never been so close, but so far away
It's like my mind is telling me to just back off
And my heart says just stay
Tell me what's a love
That doesn't keep you up all night and all day
And if it's not too late, maybe I realize it one day
We can go to the movies girl, maybe we could hang out girl
Whatever you wanna do, cause I'm down for it
I'm down for you

[Break: Kehlani & (BJ the Chicago Kid)]
(I'm down for you baby)
Babe, I'm down for you
(Are you down for me?)
I'm down for you
I'm down for you

[Hook 1: Kehlani & BJ the Chicago Kid]
Love ain't never been so close, but so far away
Like your mind is telling you to just back off
And your heart says just stay
What's a love that doesn't keep you up all night and all day
If it's not too late, yeah you realise it one day
We can go to the movies boy, maybe we could hang out boy
Whatever you wanna do, cause I'm down for it
I'm down for you

[Outro: BJ the Chicago Kid]
And when I'm ready baby
Maybe it won't be too late
Maybe one day you find some guy
That won't treat you like I will
Better choose up, better hurry up
Time keeps ticking, but you're my lover[Verse 1: Kehlani]
Pretty soon I'ma take your phone
Or you should hide it in yo pockets until you get home
Don't wanna see no tweets about the night we shared
Don't wanna hear reasons for it, baby I don't care
You and I both know I'm not just anybody
And I regret bringing yo ass to all those after parties
You enjoyed yourself too much and you ain't barely started
I just can't invest in shit to end up broken-hearted

[Chorus: Kehlani]
You stay taking pictures, pictures
Just to show them to your bitches, bitches
So you can make 'em jealous
Now I know where your head is
Man you stay taking those pictures, pictures
Just to show them to your bitches, bitches
So you can make 'em jealous
So now I gotta dead this

[Verse 2: Kehani]
So lowkey, I just stay out the way
I built a lab up in the crib so I don't leave all day
You always try to rush out when I need you to stay
But don't forget to post a pic of you with yo bae
And by the way, I see right through it
I let you slide now cause I know you not use to it
If this is the way it is, don't even put me through it
I'm quick to cut it off, if you don't believe I'll do it

[Chorus: Kehlani]
You stay taking pictures, pictures
Just to show them to your bitches, bitches
So you can make 'em jealous
Now I know where your head is
Man you stay taking those pictures, pictures
Just to show them to your bitches, bitches
So you can make 'em jealous
So now I gotta dead this

[Verse 3: Lexii Alijai]
Boy don't tell me that you sorry when
You with them bitches every night when you be partying
Then you come late night, trying to hide your phone
You know that shit'll always end up in an argument
Why you always taking risk with me?
Hold me close by my waist, take pics with me
Women crush Wednesday's mean shit to me
Little kid shit and I don't let it get to me
Literally the whole world know this shit
Need a girl but you busy chasing hoes and shit
You the type to try to keep it on the low and shit
I need a real fly nigga, I'm the coldest bitch
I'm so legit, I goes and get
Got your bitches, they be all up on my shows and shit
Look, keep it real, cause every time we chill
All you wanna do is post a pic

[Chorus: Kehlani]
You stay taking pictures, pictures
Just to show them to your bitches, bitches
So you can make 'em jealous
Now I know where your head is
Man you stay taking those pictures, pictures
Just to show them to your bitches, bitches
So you can make 'em jealous
So now I gotta dead this[Intro: Kehlani]

They know I ain't playin' 'bout you (Playin' 'bout you)

[Pre-Chorus: Keyshia Cole]
That's why you know you're my heart (My heart)

You saw right through every last bit of me
I should've known it from your energy
We've got this synergy, your soul feels close
Like it remembers meinstilled in me
90 degrees in California, you put chills in me
Said it's something about my city, something about my city
Oakland girls so damn hood but we're so damn pretty
Sometimes the town just brings you down
But we feel no pity
Don't need no extra bodies, I got the connect with me
It's why you connect with me, it's why you can step with me
Why you can go hit the carpets
Go 'head and get dressed with me
Make me forget my ex and you onto the next with me
Love has everything to do, Bobby needs his creds Whitney
I always said I'd be the one to do it
I changed the way they lookin' at us women makin' music
Go put back on the crown, stop makin' us look so stupid
Not worried about these niggas
Unless it's you then I'm choosin'
Even if I chose I feel like you're the right decision
Yeah you got aspirations, you ain't fuckin' up the vision
I love that you're not worried 'bout any other niggas
Only longing for persistence, only want something consistent
Does it make you nervous I'm not afraid to say what I want?
Does it put fear into your heart that I know where I started?
Far from where I begun?
Cause I know every man has a fear
Of a strong-minded woman
But I say she's a keeper if she got it
On her own and keeps it runnin'

[Outro]
If she can keep it all runnin'
If she can keep it all runnin'
Keeps it runnin'
If she can keep it all runnin'
Keeps it runnin'
If she can keep it all runnin'[Verse 1]
They sleeping, they sleeping
They sleeping, they sleeping on me
But I dont waste my time
Tryna prove that Im something to see
Oh I, the real ones they know
And the ones that do not, I dont need
'Cause most see the vision and I give reasons to believe
That Im honest, Im honest, Im telling no lies
When I say Im up next, Im not just for the ride
Never a point when I questioned my mind
Know what Im doing, I planned for this time
Come up regardless, Im coming regardless
Im hungry, Im starving, remaining a topic
Never an option, got your undivided whenever Im plotting

[Chorus]
Dont take it personal, personal, personal
Dont take it personal, personal, personal
I know it hurts to know, hurts to know, hurts to know
I dont want it (na, na, na)
Dont need it (yeah, yeah, yeah)
Dont take it personal, personal, personal
Dont take it personal, personal, personal
I know it hurts to know, hurts to know, hurts to know
I dont want it (na, na, na)
Dont need it (yeah, yeah, yeah)

[Verse 2]
I know that you hear this
And you gon' just know that Im speaking to you
Shouldnt have got so ahead of yourself
Now youre losing your cool
I know that you know that Im right
You admitted that I am the truth
But look you at you now, look at your face
Looking sad in the booth
Signed off a tape,  toured off a tape
Did it alone, and I ain't touched a plate
You was my nigga, we could have been great
You so far gone, got you thinking you're safe
All said and done, you lost my respect
All said and done, youre the one I regret
Now you gon' watch from the crowd
Lookin' up like the rest

[Chorus]
Dont take it personal, personal, personal (Look)
Dont take it personal, personal, personal
I need you to promise me one thing
I know it hurts to know, hurts to know, hurts to know
That you not gon' take it like that
I dont want it (na, na, na)
Dont need it (yeah, yeah, yeah)
Dont take it personal, personal, personal
(Promise me that you wont take it)
Dont take it personal, personal, personal
(Swear to me that you wont take it)
I know it hurts to know, hurts to know, hurts to know
I dont want it (na, na, na)
Dont need it (yeah, yeah, yeah)

[Bridge]
Now I could never judge anyone I loved
Even if you lose sight of all the things Ive done
Im not who I once was, these days Im all grown up
I fuck with me heavy, Im all chose up
And I only did right by you
When you fucked her, I stood right by you
Prayin' for the girls that believe your news
Prayin' for myself 'cause I be all truth
I got good heart, good soul, good sex
No stress, what's next for me is best
Dont you run your mouth 'cause in this song I say it best

[Chorus]
Dont take it personal, personal, personal
Dont take it personal, personal, personal
I know it hurts to know, hurts to know, hurts to know
I dont want it (na, na, na)
Dont need it (yeah, yeah, yeah)
Dont take it personal, personal, personal
Dont take it personal, personal, personal
I know it hurts to know, hurts to know, hurts to know
I dont want it (na, na, na)
Dont need it (yeah, yeah, yeah)[Intro]
Are you putting her on your thing?
Oh my god, I'm gonna
It's gonna be like TMZ Kehlani TMZ (laughs)
And then he's gonna be suing me for slander (laughs)

[Intro]
If this isn't love, why do I feel this way?

[Verse 1]
Why you got me so obsessed with you?
Why you got me wasting time laying next to you?
Why do you tell me, "Come over"
To watch you just stare at your phone?
Don't know why I expected you
To give me attention, affection and love
You're like a drug, never enough
Can't take your high, need a new plug
You got me bent, got me way too messed up

[Pre-Chorus]
And I don't know why I'm even still here
Can't shake it off, I've been here for years on top of years
And I, I'm ready to, I'm ready to, be off of you
'Cause I admit, that baby, I, I just may be stuck on you

[Chorus]
(If this isn't love)
Why do I pick up my phone every time that you call?
(Why do I feel this way?)
Why do I I feel this (feel this way?)
I'm in my feelings (If this isn't love)
Why do I let you give me half then give you my all?
(Why do I feel this way?)
Why do I do this (feel this way?)
I'm in my feelings

[Post-Chorus]
(No!) Uh-uh (whoa) Uh-uh (yeah) Uh-uh (whoa)
In my feelings
(No!) Uh-uh (whoa) Uh-uh (yeah) Uh-uh (whoa)
In my feelings

[Verse 2]
Why you be doing me scandalous?
You just assume that I'm strong and can handle it
Why do you make me feel like I'm less than my worth
And it won't be for long, I ain't having it
You don't do the shit that you said would be done
You find it fun, to feel shit and run
Love like a gun, it leaves me stunned
Out on the floor and I just can't get up

[Pre-Chorus]
And I don't know why I'm even still here
Can't shake it off, I've been here for years on top of years
And I, I'm ready to, I'm ready to, be off of you
'Cause I admit, that baby, I, I just may be stuck on you

[Chorus]
(If this isn't love)
Why do I pick up my phone every time that you call?
(Why do I feel this way?)
Why do  I feel this (feel this way?)
I'm in my feelings (If this isn't love)
Why do I let you give me half then give you my all?
(Why do I feel this way?)
Why do I do this (feel this way?)
I'm in my feelings

[Post-Chorus]
(No!) Uh-uh (whoa) Uh-uh (yeah) Uh-uh (whoa)
In my feelings
(No!) Uh-uh (whoa) Uh-uh (yeah) Uh-uh (whoa)
In my feelings

[Bridge]
Oh, why, why do I, why do I feel this way?
Why am I still this way?
Why after all these times, you still play all these games?
Why after all these nights, I still give you all my days?

[Pre-Chorus]
And I don't know why I'm even still here
Can't shake it off, I've been here for years on top of years
And I, I'm ready to, I'm ready to, be off of you
'Cause I admit, that baby, I, I just may be stuck on you
(I just may be stuck on you)

[Chorus]
(If this isn't love)
Why do I pick up my phone every time that you call?
(Every time that you call, whoa)
Why do I I feel this (feel this)
I'm in my feelings (feel this)
Why do I let you give me half then give you my all?
(Give you my all, oh-oh)
Why do I do this (feel this way?)
I'm in my feelings

[Outro]
(No!) Uh-uh (whoa) Uh-uh (yeah) Uh-uh (whoa)
In my feelings
(No!) Uh-uh (whoa) Uh-uh (yeah) Uh-uh (whoa)
In my feelings[Verse 1: Kehlani]
Damn right, we take turns bein' grown
I get real accountable when I'm alone
I get realaboutit all whenI'm alone
It's so crazy missin' youwhen I get on

[Pre-Chorus: Kehlani & Ty Dolla $ign]
Don Julio made me a fool foryou
AndnowI might hityour phone upwith that ra-ra-ra
Missin' my da-da-da, missin' that ah-ah-ah (Ah, ah)

[Chorus: Kehlani]
All of this love is toxic
All of this love is toxic
All these kisses and hugs is knock shit
You a damn drug, you're toxic

[Verse 2: Kehlani]
Uh, all the sex on replay
Run it back like a DJ
Surfin' on your face while you eat that
Tryna make a bad bitch behave, no
I was this way for you
Put the pussy away for you
Thinkin' I would wait for you

[Pre-Chorus: Kehlani & Ty Dolla $ign, Both]
And that damn Don Julio made me a fool for you
And now I might hit your phone up with that ra-ra-ra
Missin' my da-da-da, missin' that ah-ah-ah (Ah, ah)

[Chorus: Kehlani]
And all of this love is toxic
All of this love is toxic
All these kisses and hugs is knock shit
You a damn drug, you're toxic

[Bridge: Kehlani & Ty Dolla $ign]
Problematic (Yeah)
You know that dick always been problematic (Yeah)
Somehow, I'm always caught in your dramatics
All in your acrobatics
You know I want the static
Tell me to throw it backwards, uh (Ooh)

[Pre-Chorus: Kehlani & Ty Dolla $ign, Both]
And that damn Don Julio made me a fool for you
And I still hit your phone up with that ra-ra-ra
Missin' my da-da-da, missin' that ah-ah-ah (Ah, ah, ooh, yeah)

[Chorus: Kehlani & Ty Dolla $ign]
All of this love is toxic
All of this love is toxic
All these kisses and hugs is knock shit (Take turns bein' grown)
You a damn drug, you're toxic[Verse 1]
Every time we drew our lines
They grew legs and walked themselves down the road
Boundaries is my middle name
I give respect where it's asked or it's shown

[Pre-Chorus]
Something 'bout our exchange
It's a fight to act like you weren't in mind, or mine
Never want to complain, love you with your wings babe
These are your skies

[Chorus]
But then there was the blood from your heart on my hands again
Though I swore I washed it off in the waves
And I wish I was sorry, damn I wish I was sorry
That I don't know how to stay away, stay away

[Verse 2]
Oh, if only you knew just how you taste
Oh, if only you'd seen you walk away
Oh I'd follow you into yesterday
Then miles away
And I pray for the love that we had underneath
When we both promised not to waste love arguing
I love you more than I ever could say

[Pre-Chorus]
And something about our exchange
It's a fight to act like you weren't in mind, or mine
And I never want to complain
Love you with your wings babe
These are your skies, your skies

[Chorus]
And there was the blood from your heart on my hands again
Though I swore I washed it out in the rain
And I wish I was sorry, damn I wish I was sorry
That I don't know how to stay away

[Bridge]
And don't say you don't want no problems
Can't hear through what I say
Say you want it your way
Always has been your way when it comes to me
Gun play, use my heart against me always
We can't seem to hold space
No way

[Chorus]
The blood from your heart on my hands again
Though I swore I washed it off in the waves
I wish I was sorry, damn I wish I was sorry
That I don't know how to stay away, stay away[Verse 1]
Never did I think I'd want you
Always seen you 'round my way
Never had the strength to tell you
I kinda, sorta think you're great
Strange for me to wanna love someone
Who's better by themselves
Hate to know I made you crazy for myself

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause I don't want you thinking
That my love's in vain
'Cause baby, I've been falling for you
But falling back up out your way

[Chorus]
'Cause I can't let you lose yourself, looking for me
And I can't let you make me your, your everything
I just wanna be an escape, I just wanna be an escape
Baby, can we escape, escape, escape?

[Verse 2]
Admiring you from a distance
Scared to go and make a move
Didn't wanna be distracting
You be all up in your groove
It's strange for me to wanna love someone
Who's raw all by themselves
I'd hate for you to search for someone else

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause I don't want you thinking
That my love's in vain
Baby, I've been falling for you
But falling up on out your way

[Chorus]
'Cause I can't let you lose yourself, looking for me
And I can't let you make me your, your everything
I just wanna be an escape, I just wanna be an escape
Baby can we escape, escape, escape?

[Bridge]
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, ayy
'Cause I've been staying low, holding back
Fighting the feelings that you've been giving
And I've been trying to put it all into words
But I can't so I'm singing

[Pre-Chorus]
I don't want you thinking
That my love's in vain
Baby, I've been falling for you
But falling back up out your way

[Chorus]
'Cause I can't let you lose yourself, looking for me
And I can't let you make me your, your everything
I just wanna be an escape
I just wanna be an escape
Baby, can we escape, escape, escape?[Intro: Reyna Biddy]
My condolences to anyone who has ever lost me
And, to anyone who got lost in me
Or, to anyone who ever felt they took a loss with me
My apologies for the misunderstanding or the lack thereof
I'm sorry you missed the God in me
And I'm sorry you missed the light
I'm sorry you forgot the way I arose like the moon
Night after night with the burden to forgive
Eager to feed you everything
See, I'm a holy woman
I know what it's like to give life to a being without ever needing to press skin against one another
I've practiced how to hold my tongue long enough
I'm afraid I forgot to say goodbye
I'm afraid you're under the impression
That I was made to please you
I was under the impression you understood me better
The truth is, I'm a superwoman
And some days I'm an angry woman
And some days I'm a crazy woman
For still waiting, for still loving harder even if I'm aching
For still trusting that I'm still worth the most
For still searching for someone to understand me better[Intro]
To be honest, I think we spend so much time
Trying to find answers for things
And maybe it's just not meant to be answered
I think sometimes the best things
Are in the unplanned and the unknown
And sometimes when we balance back and we do it
We don't know how we did it, we just do it
It's something in us, whether that's our intuition
Whether that's the way we been raised
Whether that's down to even what we put in our bodies
Do you get it? So I thinkI think that can remain a mystery
And I think that's okay for it to remain a mystery
Does that make sense?

[Verse 1]
Tryna forget all of the messages
Tryna forget all of the stressin'
'Cause damn it was (extra and)
Tryna forget all of the secondary
Feelings I had, man, it was fuckin' scary
Tryna get back to all my old ways
Tryna get back to all the hobbies
From my old days (gettin' back)
Tryna forget all the unnecessary
Thoughts from my head, man, it was pretty scary

[Pre-Chorus]
At least I learned a thing or two about me and you
What we went through, it made me who I am (I am, I am)
I can feel again, won't be numb again (numb)
At least I didn't mess it up, that was all your touch
I don't miss it much, but it made me who I am (I am, I am)
I can feel again, won't be dumb again (dumb)

[Chorus]
Said I'm tryna break off a piece of mind
A piece of mind that I can't get right
(Can't get it right)
Said I'm tryna break off a piece of mind
A piece of mind, my heart's on my side
(Heart is on my side)

[Verse 2]
You said yourself, you made me who I am
You told me that after you, I would never love again (Didn't I?)
Oh you made sure that I would lose myself
So I wouldnt see, I needed no one else
You tell me that I was worth a million smiles
And tell me that I was worth a million miles
And tryna make sure that I forget the times that
You made me think that I just couldn't shine, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
At least I learned a thing or two about me and  you
What we went through, it made me who I am (I am, I am)
I can feel again, won't be numb again (numb)
At least I didn't mess it up, that was all your touch
I don't miss it much but it made me who I am (I am, I am)
I can feel again, won't be dumb again (dumb)

[Chorus]
Said I'm tryna break off a piece of mind
A piece of mind that I can't get right
(I can't get it right)
Said I'm tryna break off a piece of mind
A piece of mind, my heart's on my side
(My heart is on my side)

[Bridge]
On my side, yeah
On my side, yeah
Gotta get a little piece of mind
Gotta make sure that it feels just right
Gotta make sure that Ill make it last this time

[Chorus]
Said I'm tryna break off a piece of mind
(I'm tryna break off)
A piece of mind that I can't get right
(Mind that I can't get)
Said I'm tryna break off a piece of mind
(A piece of my mind)
A piece of mind, my heart's on my side
(My hearts on my side)
(My heart's on my sideyeah, yeah)[Verse 1]
Torn between crying for help
And not lettin' them see me sweat
But it's certain shit Ican'tforget
I won't getover it easy, shit makes mequeasy
I am making amends with myself
Forgiving me for loving you
I took a risk loving loudly, defended you proudly
Ignored all the signs, yeah, it's true

[Pre-Chorus]
And the immature me wishes that I could make it known
That you should be left alone
Don't deserve words or thoughts from me
I can go heal on my own
And the immature me hopes the world sees just who you are, oh
A facade only gets you so far
And I'm bigger than you, so I can't meet you where you are

[Chorus]
I'd say your name but you don't deserve recognition
You played the hero but you really are the villain
There ain't a bone in me that wants to spare your feelin's
You called me crazy, but it was my intuition
Used me for status, and the fame, and recognition
It's fuckin' crazy what they do for recognition
I'd say your name but you don't deserve recognition
I'd say your name but I won't, uh

[Verse 2]
I got to give myself credit for loving as hard as I did
I helped you fight your addiction and change your whole life
Just to find myself played in the end
Ain't no regrets cause I'm proud that my heart was so pure
And I'm never ashamed of my love
Now I'm finding strength in the fact that you're nothing to me
And I know the things I am above

[Pre-Chorus]
And the immature me wishes I could just run away (Ah, ah, ah)
To somewhere I still feel sane
'Cause truth is I've been fuckin' lost since that very day
And really I'm wishing that I could just catch a break (Ah, ah, ah)
It's been Hell every couple days (Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
And now, I'm here broken, expected to carry the weight

[Chorus]
I'd say your name but you don't deserve recognition (Nah)
You played the hero but you really are the villain
There ain't a bone in me that wants to spare your feelings (Ah)
You called me crazy, but it was my intuition (Ah)
Used me for status and the fame and recognition (Ah)
It's fucking crazy what they do for recognition (Ooh)
I'd say your name but you don't deserve recognition
I'd say your name but I won't, uh

[Post-Chorus]
That's just you (Deserve recognition)

[Bridge]
I always land on my feet
Bounce back game clean and neat (Ah, woah-woah, ah)
Wish I didn't check your text when you was drunk 'sleep
I've seen everything that I ain't wanna see
That I needed to see, that I needed to be
Hope you live happily ever after with the bitch (Bitch), uh
Fly to France, wine and crackers, honeymoonin' with the bitch
Hope you fuck around and have the son you wanted with the bitch

[Outro]
Y'all might be soulmates after all of this, so
Out on the table your friends and your family, even your label
Everyone love me, damn, it's so shameful
I kept you stable, you should be grateful
I aint find out sooner that you was unfaithful
Damn, you so shameful
So fucking shameful
Damn, you're so, uh, fucking ungrateful, uh[Intro]
G-G-G-Good work, Charlie

[Verse 1]
You know they don't wanna see us together
But it don't matter, no, 'cause I got you
Anytime you're under the weather
Babe, we can always go, if I gotta pull up on you
On the east side, in the late night, in a disguise
You know I could pull up on you, keep you all night
We could stay right, on the safe side

[Chorus]
One way or another, I'ma love you
Slidin' under covers, undercover
They don't wanna see it happenbut we say, "Fuck it"
They don't wanna see it happenbut we say, "Fuck it"
One way or another, I'ma love you
Slidin' under covers, undercover
They don't wanna see it happenbut we say, "Fuck it" (fuck 'em)
They don't wanna see it happenbut we say, "Fuck it"

[Verse 2]
Baby, they don't wanna see me be happy
'Cause they ain't happy, nothey don't got you
Somethin' 'bout the way we be acting
Babe, we are magical
Might just have to hit me up, on the late night
When it's game time, I don't play nice
I need you to hit me up, on my fake line
Hit that 6-9, yeah, that FaceTime, ohh

[Chorus]
One way or another, I'ma love you
Slidin' under covers, undercover
They don't wanna see it happenbut we say, "Fuck it"
They don't wanna see it happenbut we say, "Fuck it"
One way or another, I'ma love you
Slidin' under covers, undercover
They don't wanna see it happenbut we say, "Fuck it"
They don't wanna see it happenbut we say, "Fuck it"

[Verse 3]
I'ma save your name under somethin' else
I'ma keep your things deep in myself
I'ma tweet our inside jokes to the outside world
To get you goin'
I'ma pick you up from the back entrance
Kept you in the world when it's all pretend
You're just you, I'm just me
There's no us, it's nothin'

[Chorus]
One way or another, I'ma love you
Slidin' under covers, undercover
They don't wanna see it happenbut we say, "Fuck it"
They don't wanna see it happenbut we say, "Fuck it"
One way or another, I'ma love you
Slidin' under covers, undercover
They don't wanna see it happenbut we say, "Fuck it"
They don't wanna see it happenbut we say, "Fuck it"[Verse 1]
This used to be my favorite time of the morning
Text you like, "Good morning"
It's beenaday, we ain'tspoken
All of me feels frozen
How couldyou let it go like that?
How come it always goes like that?
Wondering where I mess up at
To always go through it, always go through this
Why I gotta beg to be chosen
Over your vices, over your liquor?
Why I gotta ask for flowers?
I deserve roses, I deserve bigger
I know you're tryna change, but is it all worth the wait?
It hurts to stay just as much as it hurts to walk away

[Chorus]
You got demons, I got trauma
We both got triggers, I hate drama
I'm embarrassed, I'm in shock
Here wide open, and that don't stop
And I watch your demons cause me trauma
Now I'm triggered, all this drama
You're embarrassed and in shock
And we still in love and that shit don't stop
Man, that shit don't stop

[Post-Chorus]
Don't stop
Don't stop
Don't stop
No, no, no, it don't stop

[Verse 2]
And I'll still tell the world I'm in love with you
'Cause I ain't ashamed of shit
Got your name tatted on my wrist
Any bitch got a bone to pick, you know whose phone to hit
'Cause I'm still with all the actions and all that shit
You're still my love, you're still my heart, that's still my dick
Still wanna be Mrs. Jackson, still wanna be your co-captain
So don't lose a girl of your dreams
Waited five years to be on my team
Looked damn good fucking with me
Love how I'm always on twenty
How I keep it tight and cleanly
Fuck you in the truck when it's empty
And I throw it back when you miss me
And I pull up when you hit me
I'ma say it loud so you hear me (Oh)

[Chorus]
You got demons, I got trauma
We both got triggers, I hate drama (I hate drama, no)
I'm embarrassed, I'm in shock
Here wide open, and that don't stop (Oh no)
And I watch your demons cause me trauma
Now I'm triggered, all this drama
You're embarrassed and in shock
And we still in love and that shit don't stop
Man, that shit don't stop

[Post-Chorus]
Don't stop, no, no, no
Don't stop, no, no, no
Oh, don't stop
No, no, no, it don't stop

Little girl, watching her reflection
As she parts her curls into four sections
She says, "I don't look like them, I don't look like her"
"And I don't want what's on my head"
But baby girl don't be misled (Yeah, yeah)
Young woman reading magazines
Thinking to herself, nobody looks like me
Oh I've got all these curves, all this nerve
Why can't I keep a man?
But baby girl if you love yourself you can

[Chorus 1]
Can't nobody love somebody
That do not love themselves
You are what you choose to be
It's not up to no one else
So be great, be kind
Don't let them dim your light
A woman like the sun should always stay bright

[Verse 2]
Little boy sitting in the bleachers
Staring at, at his dirty sneakers
Thinking my shoes don't shine
Money is tight, I would never get a date
But baby boy that's not what it takes
Young man, always at the center
Finding ways to make his arms look bigger
Saying, "You see those guys?"
"They get all the girls, I just want to be like them"
But baby boy, you're spreading yourself thin

[Chorus 2]
Can't nobody love somebody
That do not love themselves
You are what you choose to be
It's not up to no one else
So be great, be kind
Don't let them dim your light
Cause a man like the sun should always stay bright

[Outro]
Yes, you are like the sun so always stay bright[Speech]

[Intro]
I, I, I, I

[Verse 1]
Up for hours drinking
Posted up, just reflecting on it
And I know you won't believe me
But babe, I'm cold and yeah, this life is cold
I say swear you won't come near me
Keep your heart 'cause I could fuck you up
Or have you never thinking clearly, never thinking clearly
Have you all up in your feelings
Experienced, I did it times before
And I can see you from a distance
I could fuck you now and years later on
You gon' be stuck, just reminiscing
It's the way I ride you, let you stay inside and
Yeah, I'ma fuck you like a vixen
There's something 'bout me

[Pre-Chorus]
Swear you see the good in me
But that don't beat the hood in me
And I got my intentions and use
Guess I'm make believe
'Cause baby, I know, baby, I know

[Chorus]
I, I'ma do you dirty
Say you love me now
But baby, it's too early
I, I'ma do you dirty
You think you love me now
I think you should be worried

[Verse 2]
Up for days, been rolling
Sweating bullets, don't regret the choices
That I made 'cause I'm still growing
Sign the deal and then they cut the check
And ever since, my color's showing
Change the scene, the things are better now
You know the wave is never slowing
The wave is never slowing
I know that you will miss it
You liked it when I used to leave a wound
And promise I would come and kiss it
I fed you lies and you just ate 'em up
And I don't care to do the dishes
I ain't no wifey, ain't gon' hold you down
It's way more fun to be the mistress
I know I'm not like other bitches

[Pre-Chorus]
Swear you see the good in me
But that don't beat the hood in me
And I got my intentions and use
Guess I'm make believe 'cause baby, I know, baby, I know

[Chorus]
I, I'ma do you dirty
Say you love me now
But baby, it's too early
I, I'ma do you dirty
You think you love me now
I think you should be worried

[Bridge]
You want all my time
But I don't got enough
Baby, I can put it down
But I can't put it up
I got too much time to live
Well I'm still way too young
I'm still way too young, yeah

[Chorus]
I'ma do you dirty
I, I'ma do you dirty
Say you love me now
But baby, it's too early
I, I'ma do you dirty
You think you love me now
I think you should be worried[Verse 1]
Not cookie cutter not picture perfect
Unexpected but I'm worth it
Could expose you to this life, if that's what you like
Explore your thoughts, stop actin' scared
I could see you watching let me take it there
Let me show you what it's like, to fuck with something right
Girl let me put you on with something real
Wanna show you how it feels, to rock with something trill
So come join me in this room girl it's time
I know what you like baby, let me get you right

[Hook]
Oh na na, let me put you on
Oh na na na, let me put you on
Said she wanna try it, ain't tryna hide it
Fuck all of that fightin', ain't doin' no more lyin'

[Verse 2]
I start off slow so you feel secure
Just let me know where you feel it more
If your breath gets quick, that's normal
If my hands move slick, that's normal
We could smoke one first if you tryna get lit
My weed on ten come take a hit
Cause we on girl, we on
Girl let me put you on with something real
Wanna show you how it feels, to rock with something trill
So come join me in this room girl it's time
I know what you like baby, let me get you right

[Hook]
Oh na na, let me put you on
Oh na na na, let me put you on

[Hook]
Oh na na, let me put you on
Oh na na na, let me put you on
Said she wanna try it, ain't tryna hide it
Fuck all of that fightin', ain't doin' no more lyin'[Verse 1]
You got a lot of things to say
You got a lot of things on your plate
You got a lot on me
Know a lot of things that I just can not say is quite on my wave
You bitches riding on all my waves
But you bitches tired and underpaid
And shawty got zero percent on her publishing
Cause she don't write the shit she say
Cause I'm up right now, been up
I'll come down when I'm not so high
And life's not so loud
Cause I been wet, tsunami the mob, that's a real set
Tsunami the sound, they the real best
Tsunami rolled in that's the realest, realest

[Pre-Hook]
You can tell me you ain't mean it
You can tell me it's deceiving
That you said it for no reason
But you seeming like you tryna get asked

[Hook]
Did I? Did I?
Hurt your feelings when I stunted like that
Hurt your feelings when I stunted like that
Did I? Did I?
Hurt your feelings when I hustled like that
Hurt your feelings when I hustled like that
Did I? Did I?
Waste my time, tryna keep it all running
Waste my time, tryna keep it all running
Did I? Did I?
Hurt your feelings when I hustled like that
Hurt your feelings when I stunted like that
Did I? Did I?

[Verse 2]
You used to living through all the screens
You used to wearing designer things
You don't know nothing 'bout working your way from the bottom and earning every ring
You think we competing for rings, you think you playing in my league
But you couldn't catch up if I took a break and vacationed for weeks on top of weeks
Cause I'm up right now, been up
I'll come down when I'm not so high
And life's not so loud
Cause I been hard, I write every word and they been bars
Take every title, they been ours
Pull up lowkey cause we been stars, been stars

[Pre-Hook]
You can tell me you ain't mean it
You can tell me it's deceiving
That you said it for no reason
But you seeming like you tryna get asked

[Hook]
Did I? Did I?
Hurt your feelings when I stunted like that
Hurt your feelings when I stunted like that
Did I? Did I?
Hurt your feelings when I hustled like that
Hurt your feelings when I hustled like that
Did I? Did I?
Waste my time, tryna keep it all running
Waste my time, tryna keep it all running
Did I? Did I?
Hurt your feelings when I hustled like that
Hurt your feelings when I stunted like that
Did I? Did I?

[Bridge]
You can't fake it
You can't fake it
You can't fake it
What is real is recognizing
We don't recognize you
You can't take it
You can't take it
You can't take it
It's too real for you to handle
So I got one more question

[Hook]
Did I?
Hurt your feelings when I stunted like that
Hurt your feelings when I stunted like that
Did I? Did I?
Hurt your feelings when I hustled like that
Hurt your feelings when I hustled like that
Did I?

Did I? Did I?
Hurt your feelings when I hustled like that

Did I? Did I?

[Outro]
Did I miss out on you?[Intro]
Sometimes I just be doing shit that don't make any fucking sense
Like I just be doing shit knowing that it's no good for me
All the time

[Verse 1]
Anything you're saying to me right now
Probably have the right to say
Any crazy things you're feeling for me tonight
You can get it on out the way

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause I ain't been the best that I coulda been
I ain't do the shit that I shoulda did
But every time I come crawlin' on my knees
You're there

[Chorus]
And you just keep on takin' me back
And I don't know why you do
'Cause I'm no good to you
And you just keep on takin' me back
In your open arms, baby, I belong
And you just keep on takin'

[Verse 2]
You can yell and you can curse and call me a bitch
Probably have the right to do
You can tell the world that I'm a narcissist
I would think they'd listen to you

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause I ain't been the best that I coulda been
I ain't do the shit that I shoulda did
But every time I come crawlin' on my knees
You're there

[Chorus]
And you just keep on takin' me back
And I don't know why you do
'Cause I'm no good to you
And you just keep on takin' me back
In your open arms, baby, I belong
And you just keep on takin'

[Post-Chorus]
Me back, and I don't know why you do
'Cause I'm no good to you
And you just keep on takin' me back
In your open arms, baby, I belong
And you just keep on takin'

[Outro]
I'm not taking you back
Oh no, I'm nono I'mtaking me
You're taking me really back
No I'm, no I'm, no I'm, no I'm not[Intro]
Probably because there are so many things that he didn't, I tried to forget, you know I try to forgive, I forgive her, but you, you know when, you go back and you think about the things he did, nobody, I don't know nobody like him.

[Verse 1]
Up at a time when I shouldn't be
Thinking 'bout things that I shouldn't be
Sad about shit I've been sad about for the past year
I've been low, I've been down and out it
And it 'cause of you and love if there's any doubts
I've been here and you know the times that I'm talking 'bout

[Pre-Chorus]
(Oh, oh) I would give it all to make it all work
(Oh, oh) I wish I could say that you knew my worth
(Oh, oh) End of the day, you was my first
At the end of the day, I know your words

[Chorus]
I love you shawty, shawty
You know you my shawty, shawty
I need you to make me happy
There will never be nobody
My ring is yours (save it, for me)
Everything is yours (save it all for me)
My ring is yours (save it, for me)
Everything is yours

[Verse 2]
Thinkin' 'bout your bed when I shouldn't be
Missing all that when I shouldn't be
You was on the road, I was on the road
We'd be back to back, back and forth
They know how it goes, know you got your pride
Just admit you hate being alone
Know you allowed to know
I'm sitting right beside your throne

[Pre-Chorus]
(Oh, oh) I'd ignored my friends, they ain't gon' make it all work
(Oh, oh) But I just can't say that you know my worth
(Oh, oh) End of the day, you're still my first
At the end of the day, I know your words

[Chrous]
I love you shawty, shawty (you know it)
You know you my shawty, shawty
(You know you my shawty)
I need you to make me happy
There will never be nobody
My ring is yours (save it, for me)
Everything is yours (save it all for me)
My ring is yours (save it, for me)
Everything is yours (yours)
My ring is yours (save it, for me)
Everything is yours (save it all for me)
My ring is yours (save it, for me)
Everything is yours[Verse 1]
I know I'm not what you need
Baby, why you trying? Come over and comfort me
Ain't no sense in lying, do you deserve it honestly?
We could just part ways, find out our own destiny
Baby, baby, baby

[Pre-Chorus]
You know I'm more than just a girl
That you can meet walking down the street
I think you know that I'm the one
That you want in your company

[Chorus]
I'm too much of a woman
Too much of a woman
Too much of a bad ass bitch
Too much of a boss, baby, it's your loss
Now you gotta live with it

[Post-Chorus]
Too much, three much
Four much, five much, too much for you
Too much, three much
Four much, five much, too much for you
(Too much, too much, too much for you, yeah)

[Verse 2]
There ain't really nothing left
Baby, that's a promise, you were fucking with the best
Something I will say, that I might just miss your sex
That don't mean I want you, you can go and stay my ex
Baby, baby, baby

[Pre-Chorus]
You know I'm more than just a girl
That you can meet walking down the street
I think you know that I'm the one
That you want in your company

[Chorus]
I'm too much of a woman
Too much of a woman
Too much of a bad ass bitch
Too much of a boss, baby, it's your loss
Now you gotta live with it

[Post-Chorus]
Too much, three much
Four much, five much, too much for you
Too much, three much
Four much, five much, too much for you

[Bridge]
You told me you love me, I told you I wanna see it
You told me it's mine and I could have it when I pleases
Every night we sexing, you wearing your Jesus pieces
Like Jesus Christ himself gon' save a nigga from misleading
I want you to know that I meant that, gotta know that I sent that
Text in the middle of the night
To tell your ass how to fuck that flight
'Cause I can't sit at home on your couch
Listening to word of mouth 'bout how you been out
And about fucking hoes, playing out

[Chorus]
('Cause) I'm too much of a woman
Too much of a woman (too much)
Too much of a bad ass bitch
Too much of a boss, baby, it's your loss
Now you gotta live with it

[Post-Chorus]
Too much, three much
Four much, five much, too much for you
Too much, three much
Four much, five much, too much for you

[Outro]
Too much, too much for you, baby, yeah
Too much, too much, no
Too much, too much for you[Verse 1]
You have a way with words
Your silence is a curse
You always seem to break me down, down, down
My swollen heart you curve
Your comfort makes it worse
I don't want you around, 'round, 'round, 'round

[Pre-Chorus]
Cause how is the man of my dreams
Not a man of his words?
And how is the man for me
Just a man that makes me hurt?

[Chorus]
It's time to take my own
Take my own advice, take my own advice
Need me to take my own
Take my own advice, take my own advice

[Verse 2]
I almost lost my mind, yeah
I left myself behind, yeah
I almost crashed and fell right from the sky
I took a chance on this, yeah
I took too big a risk, yeah
And now Im left with pain to get me high

[Pre-Chorus]
Cause how is the man of my dreams
Not a man of his words?
And how is the man for me
Just a man that makes me hurt?

[Chorus]
It's time to take my own
Take my own advice, take my own advice
Need me to take my own
Take my own advice, take my own advice

[Bridge]
You had to break me, take me, to make me better
But I had to save me, baby, now or never

[Pre-Chorus]
Cause how is the man of my dreams
Not a man of his words?
And how is the man for me
Just a man that makes me hurt?

[Chorus]
It's time to take my own
Take my own advice, take my own advice
Need me to take my own
Take my own advice, take my own advice

[Verse 1: Kehlani]
Why you askin' 'bout X, Y, Z?
Why you worried 'bout who was fuckin' me?
Who's to the right in my SUV?
It's none of your, none of your, none of your bees
Callin' my girls to check where I been
If you needed to know, I'd drop a pin
Keepin' to yourself really ain't a sin
But you can't, you can't let me live

[Pre-Chorus: Kehlani]
You put on a show
'Cause you don't want the world to know
That you lost a girl who got it on her own
It'd be good for you to let it go, let it go, let it go

[Chorus: Kehlani]
Ain't nunya business (Nunya)
Ain't nunya business (Nunya)
To know who I'm with
Or none of my shit
Ain't nunya business (Nunya)
Ain't nunya business (Nunya)
To know who I'm with
Or none of my shit (None of my shit)

[Verse 2: Kehlani]
Don't worry 'bout who it is now
Don't worry 'bout if he got kids now
If he's richer than you, slicker than you
His net worth bigger than you
And his dick game thicker than you
It's on me, not you (Not you)
Worry 'bout you go home to (Home to)
Worry 'bout if she gon' leave you (Leave you)
When she find out all that you do

[Pre-Chorus: Kehlani]
'Cause you put on a show
'Cause you don't want the world to know
That you lost a girl who got it on her own
It'd be good for you to let it go, let it go, let it go

[Chorus: Kehlani]
Ain't nunya business (Nunya)
Ain't nunya business (Nunya)
To know who I'm with
Or none of my shit
Ain't nunya business (Nunya)
Ain't nunya business (Nunya)
To know who I'm with
Or none of my shit (None of my shit)

[Verse 3: Dom Kennedy]
Ayy, I admit it, I admit
If I saved her phone number then I did it (Hello?)
It's hard when the coupe all black (Yeah)
Just left Melrose, got it waxed, done
Now I'm on the other side of the track
If the grass greener, let me know (Let me know)
These thoughts in my head, gotta let 'em out
I know it's due to the girls I let stick around
My heart on my sleeve, check the tag
It's priceless and that lil' crisis
Put me on a slight binge, had me switchin' my plans
Can't worry 'bout the past, seen you out here holdin' hands
I shoulda knew that was comin' (Why?)
I know a few that did done it (Huh?)
By my lonely when they see me 'round town
I'm all business, no feelings, not now

[Pre-Chorus: Kehlani & Dom Kennedy]
'Cause you put on a show (Haha)
'Cause you don't want the world to know
That you lost a girl who got it on her own (Wow)
It'd be good for you to let it go, let it go, let it go, woah

[Chorus: Kehlani & Dom Kennedy]
Ain't nunya business (Ain't none of your, yeah)
Ain't nunya business (None of your, yeah)
To know who I'm with (To know who I'm with)
Or none of my shit (Oh, none of my shit, yeah)
Ain't nunya business (Ain't none of your)
Ain't nunya business (No it ain't, no, no)
To know who I'm with (To know who I'm with)
Or none of my shit (None of my shit, yeah)

[Outro: Dom Kennedy]
Word?
You got it all figured out, huh?
Do your thang then
You know where to find me
Get what you want
Yeah[Verse 1]
Ask a woman when you are broken
You make a choice to stay down or go and
Find something to bring you back
To get you right, get you right on track
I was chosen, he found me in the perfect moment
Found my lows and made them high
Saw my storm and cleared my skies
I don't think I can deny

[Chorus]
He makes me feel wanted
Like no one has before
He don't want nothing from me
But to know my love's for sure
Hate to be you watching him love me
I'd hate to be you watching him touch me
Now I am blessed to have what I need
Nothing compares, he is all I see

[Verse 2]
When I loved you I didn't love me
You were this dark cloud hanging above me
Got all my girls like, "Lani where'd you go?
You've begun to slip away into where, nobody knows"
I'm doing better
I brushed myself off, changed the weather
Like the Sun you are so warm, and for once I feel adored
Oh I could not ask for more

[Chorus]
He makes me feel wanted
Like no one has before
He don't want nothing from me
But to know my love's for sure
Hate to be you watching him love me
I'd hate to be you watching him touch me
Now I am blessed to have what I need
Nothing compares, he is all I see[Pre-Chorus: Kehlani]
You told me I'm beautiful
'Cause I told you you don't tell me enough
You're lying next to me
'Cause I told you you don't touch me enough
Now you told me you'd stay with me
'Cause I told you you've been working too much
You told me you care for me
'Cause I told you you don't show me your love

[Chorus: Kehlani]
Show me your love, show me your love
Show me your love, show me your love
Show me your love, show me your love
Show me your love, show me your love
Show me your love, show me your love

[Verse 1: Kehlani]
Don't you think that we're too old to play your game?
And we ain't go through all of this to stay the same
But you can pick a player just so I can get my way (Way, way)
And I think you do this 'cause you realise I won't wait (Wait, wait)
I see right through every look in your eyes
I hear right through every fairytale lie
Won't say a word, but the stories you write
They tell me enough

[Pre-Chorus: Kehlani]
And you told me I'm beautiful
'Cause I told you you don't tell me enough
You're lying next to me
'Cause I told you you don't touch me enough
Now you told me you stay with me
'Cause I told you you've been working too much
You told me you care for me
'Cause I told you you don't show me your love

[Chorus: Kehlani]
Show me your love, show me your love
Show me your love (Show you love), show me your love
Show me your love, show me your love (Show you love)
Show me your love, show me your love (Show you love)
Show me your love (Show, show)

[Verse 2: 6LACK]
I don't wanna make you think
That I'm sayin' things 'cause you prompted me
Been working with a lag, a fucked up past
I want you to be proud of me
It seems like day one, you was fond of me
Same shit I felt for you
Then I fell for you, fell in life
It's embarrassing to tell the truth
But now it's to the point where my love is up for debate
And maybe it's too late to shake
I think love is shown, you think love is spoken
And we both comin' from the same place
For every song that I write is a note to self
Note to God, note to you
Don't count me out
Besides this and my daughter, I only got love for you
I've been suppressed, I ain't the best
Roll up the problems, smoke all the stress
We got way too much shit on the line
But you can't see, emotions got you blind
Past life aggression, life time lessons, carryin' a message
Real life angels, battlin' depression

[Chorus: Kehlani & 6LACK]
Show me your love, show me your love (Show you love)
Show me your love, show me your love
Show me your love, show me your love (Show you love)
Show me your love, show me your love
Show me your love (Show you love)
Show me your love (Show, show)
Show me your love, show me your love (Show you love)
Show me your love, show me your love
Show me your love, show me your love (Show you love)
Show me your love, show me your love
Show me your love (Show you love)
Show me your love (Show, show)[Verse 1: Kehlani]
Rain is good for the soul
Crazy how I feel the most warm when it's cold
Drops hit the window and I drop down to the floor
I assume this is when I would miss you the most
I'm lying down
I've got this notepad where you laid your head
We use to go round and round
Making love in my bed
We were in so deep
We could barely tread
But now I found a way to heal myself instead

[Chorus: Kehlani]
And damn I feel alive
Baby, damn I feel alive
It's like something has to die
To help you realizedamn I feel alive

[Verse 2: Kehlani]
We were in a weird place
Crazy how a person you love could just change
Now I am learning to realize we needed our space
I could never hurt you, we use to be great
And you use to say, what goes around comes around so fast
Now just look at the way
I'm moving on and you stuck in the past
I deserve a love that is gonna last
But until then I will just raise this glass

[Chorus: Kehlani]
And damn I feel alive
Baby, damn I feel alive
It's like something has to die
To help you realizedamn I feel alive

[Bridge: Kehlani]
I feel, I feel
Turn this song up if you feel alive
I feel, you feel
Let it all go cause right now's the time
Let go, live on
So you can be free, yeah free to fly
I know it's hard but it's worth it

[Chorus: Kehlani]
And damn I feel alive
Baby, damn I feel alive
It's like something has to die
To help you realizedamn I feel alive[Verse 1: Kehlani]
Patience could've done us well
'Cause I could tell that all we lack was presence
And I would've fell, you could've helped

[Pre-Chorus: Kehlani]
But heres to being honest
Neither of us knew what we wanted
But all we knew is that we cared
Still all we painted was a moment

[Chorus: Kehlani]
And when I walked away
I left footsteps in the mud so you could follow me
And when I walked away
I left footsteps in the mud so you could follow me
Youre so bad at holding water, slips right through your fingers
We'd both end up drowning, it would hit the ground
And then the path would wash away, wash away

[Verse 2: Kehlani]
Yeah
And I really wanna work this out 'cause I'm tired of fightin'
And I really hope you still want me the way I want you
And it really feels like this shit been on autopilot
And it's habitual to be the bitch I am, but not the chick you want
Residual damage left in place of what was beautiful
Excuses only work when what we've done is still excusable
You let the truth unfold

[Pre-Chorus: Kehlani]
But still, cheers to being honest
Neither of us knew what we wanted
But all we knew is that we cared
Still all we painted was a moment

[Chorus: Kehlani]
And when I walked away
I left footsteps in the mud so you could follow me
And when I walked away
I left footsteps in the mud so you could follow me
Youre so bad at holding water, slips right through your fingers
We'd both end up drowning, it would hit the ground
And then the path would wash away, wash away

[Verse 3: Musiq Soulchild]
You are a vision of perfection
In my eyes, I was caught up in a blessing
Didn't realize how it wasn't fair to compare
All the things I know that I've been through
As if you didn't have anything that you went through
I treated you like medicine, but I guess I wasn't listening
And you tried to explain that you had hurt and pain, too
But as long as I felt better, then it was all good
But we wasn't good, so convinced that things were understood
Meanwhile, I had baggage to unpack, and I just had to admit that
Still dealing with the battles, feeling so inadequate
And I know that I shoulda stayed
But at the time, it felt like I had to quit
And I know that you probably thinking
Just I ain't thinking 'bout myself
But you still playing in my head to this day talking 'bout, oh

[Pre-Chorus: Kehlani & Musiq Soulchild, Kehlani, (Musiq Soulchild)]
You could've helped
But still, cheers to being honest
Neither of us knew what we wanted (No)
But all we knew is that we cared (Uh)
Still all we painted was a moment (Ah)

[Chorus: Kehlani & Musiq Soulchild]
And when I walked away
I left footsteps in the mud so you could follow me
And when I walked away
I left footsteps in the mud so you could follow me
Youre so bad at holding water, slips right through your fingers
We'd both end up drowning, it would hit the ground
And then the path would wash away, wash away (Wash away)[Intro]
Don't let it go, let it go
Don't let it slip away

[Verse 1]
Every man wants a queen
Like Jada in her prime 1990's fine
Gotta match his fly like something from a dream, or movie script
When you kiss her lips, should feel something like this
All of a sudden music's playing in the background
Not just any music talking Mr. Soul Child
Sparks will fly when lips first touch
All of these doubts get left in the dust
Heat of the moment so no room to judge, no room to judge

[Hook]
So tonight you should go and take a chance with her
She could be everything you wanted, everything you wanted boy
Don't let that get away
Don't let that slip away
Don't let that love escape
Don't let that get, don't let that get away, don't let that
Don't let that slip away
Don't let that love escape
Don't let that get away
Don't let that slip away
Don't let that love escape

[Verse 2]
I always wondered 'bout why you let me go?
Why you let me walk, up on out that door?
We just went out for drinks
Then you took me home
Walked me to my porch
Where you turned me on
That night you told me that you heard it in the background
Not just any music talking Mr. Soul Child
Said you was scared to come fuck with me cause you see I'm chasing dreams
But that don't mean that I don't need no love

[Hook]
So tonight you should go and take a chance with her
She could be everything you wanted, everything you wanted boy
Don't let that get away
Don't let that slip away
Don't let that love escape
Don't let that get, don't let that get away, don't let that
Don't let that slip away
Don't let that love escape
Don't let that get away
Don't let that slip away
Don't let that love escape[Verse 1]
There's always been those times when I needed a breather
When I might need a quick break from being the leader
Cause I'm just human, you gotta feel that
We're all just here to learn and everyday we are put up to bat
If you feeling down, no you ain't alone
And if you feeling all confused, no you are not on your own
Don't stress, yeah we're too blessed

[Pre-Chorus]
Someone once told me
Babe, when the tide gets high, you just get low
Hold your breath and take it slow
Yes I might get wet, I might get thrown
But Ill resurface all on my own

[Chorus]
I'll be alright, be alright
Just go with the tide
I'll be alright, be alright
I'll be doing fine
Be alright, be alright
Just go with the tide

[Verse 2]
I always have those days when I feel unworthy
When I sit back and ask God why he chose me
Cause I'm just human, just like you are
We see the same ol' sky, at night we see the same stars
So if you feeling down, no you not alone
And if you feeling all confused
No you are not on your own
Don't trip, baby just live

[Pre-Chorus]
Someone once told me
Babe, when the tide gets high, you just get low
Hold your breath and take it slow
Yes I might get wet, I might get thrown
But Ill resurface all on my own

[Chorus]
I'll be alright, be alright
Just go with the tide
I'll be alright, be alright
I'll be doing fine
Be alright, be alright
Just go with the tide[Verse 1]
They didn't want me then, they want me now
Did not want me to win, but now they're proud
Now they're payin' to get in, they in the crowd
Tell me how's the view now? Tell me, how's the view now?
Bein' low, yeah you a snake
You puttin' on a show, that Ricki Lake
Hey man I don't trip, my life's great
But swallow that pride, tell me how that shit taste

[Pre-Chorus]
Tell me how shit taste
Tell me how that shit taste
Tell me how that shit taste
Bitch tell me how that

[Chorus]
Always crowdin' it cause they solvin' me
In the mall goin' up cause they go hard for me
Yeah the only way is up, y'all gon' ball with me
Man the whole damn fam gon' touch the sky with me
Touch the sky with me, touch the sky with me
Man the whole damn fam gon' touch the sky with me
Touch the sky with me, touch the sky with me
Man the whole damn fam gon' touch the sky with me

[Verse 2]
They askin' for the verse, a hundred racks
If you ain't talkin' money, then run it back
My pockets too deep for 'em not to be stacked
Yeah you lookin' like distraction, now fall back
Bitch your music's been weak, your fashion wack
Was talkin' out your neck, not even facts
I'm way too real to stoop low
I'm too busy on the road, I'm too busy bookin' shows
Yeah you know how that shit taste

[Pre-Chorus]
Tell me how shit taste
Tell me how that shit taste
Tell me how that shit taste
Bitch tell me how that

[Chorus]
Always crowdin' it cause they solvin' me

Touch the sky with me, touch the sky with me
Man the whole damn fam gon' touch the sky with me
Touch the sky with me, touch the sky with me
Man the whole damn fam gon' touch the sky with me[Verse 1]
Well, you almost had me fooled
Told me that I was nothing without you
Oh, but after everything you've done
I can thank you for how strong I have become

[Pre-Chorus]
Cause you brought the flames and you put me through hell
I had to learn how to fight for myself
And we both know all the truth I could tell
I'll just say this is I wish you farewell

[Chorus]
I hope you're somewhere prayin, prayin'
I hope your soul is changin', changin'
I hope you find your peace
Falling on your knees, prayin'

[Verse 2]
I'm proud of who I am
No more monsters, I can breathe again
And you said that I was done
Well, you were wrong and now the best is yet to come
'Cause I can make it on my own, oh
And I don't need you, I found a strength Ive never known
Ill bring thunder, I'll bring rain, oh-oh
When Im finished, they won't even know your name

[Pre-Chorus]
You brought the flames and you put me through hell
I had to learn how to fight for myself
And we both know all the truth I could tell
I'll just say this is I wish you farewell

[Chorus]
I hope you're somewhere prayin, prayin'
I hope your soul is changin', changin'
I hope you find your peace
Falling on your knees, prayin'

[Bridge]
Oh, sometimes I pray for you at night
Someday, maybe you'll see the light
Oh, some say, in life, you're gonna get what you give
But some things only God can forgive

[Chorus]
I hope you're somewhere prayin', prayin'
I hope your soul is changin', changin'
I hope you find your peace
Falling on your knees, prayin'[Verse 1]
Wake up in the morning feelin' like P. Diddy (Hey, what up, girl?)
Grab my glasses, I'm out the door, I'm gonna hit this city (Let's go)
Before I leave, brush my teeth with a bottle of Jack
'Cause when I leave for the night, I ain't coming back

[Pre-Chorus 1]
I'm talkin' pedicure on our toes, toes
Tryin' on all our clothes, clothes
Boys blowin' up our phones, phones
Drop-toppin', playin' our favorite CDs
Pullin' up to the parties

But we kick 'em to the curb unless they look like Mick Jagger

Let's be serious, come on
This is a real, this is, excuse me?
Ok, shut up

[Verse 1]
I buy my own things, I pay my own bills
These diamond rings, my automobiles
Everything I got, I bought it
Boys cant buy my love, buy my love, yeah
I do what I want (She does), say what you say (Woo)
I work real hard every day

[Chorus]
I'm a motherfucking woman, baby, alright
I don't need a man to be holding me too tight
Im a motherfucking woman, baby, that's right
I'm just having fun with my ladies here tonight
I'm a motherfucker
Mmm, yeah

[Verse 2]
Let's drive around town in my Cadillac
Girls in the front, boys in the back
Loosey as a goosey and we're looking for some fun

[Chorus]
I'm a motherfucking woman, baby, alright
I don't need a man to be holding me too tight
Im a motherfucking woman, baby, thats right
I'm just having fun with my ladies here tonight

[Bridge]
Mmm, yeah
Don't buy me a drink, I make my money
Don't touch my weave, don't call me "honey"
Cause I run my shit, baby
('Cause I run my shit, baby, I run my shit)
Don't buy me a drink, I make my money
Don't touch my weave, don't call me "honey"
('Cause I write this shit, baby, I write this shit)
I write my shit
Don't buy me a drink, I make my money
Don't touch my weave, don't call me "honey"
('Cause I run my shit, baby, I run my shit)
Don't buy me a drink, I make my money

I'm a motherfucking woman, baby, that's right
I'm just having fun with my ladies here tonight
I'm a motherfucker
Mmm, yeah[Verse 1]
I used to live in the darkness
Dress in black, act so heartless
But now I see that colors are everything
Got kaleidoscopes in my hairdo
Got back the stars in my eyes, too
Yeah, now I see the magic inside of me

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Yeah, maybe my head's fucked up
But I'm falling right back in love with being alive
Dreaming in light, light, lights
This kitty cat lost her mind
Been lookin' for a star-sent sign that I'll be alright
Look to the skies

[Chorus 1]
Ive found a rainbow, rainbow, baby
Trust me, I know, life is scary
But just put those colors on, girl
Come and play along with me tonight

[Verse 2]
I'd forgot how to daydream
So consumed with the wrong things
But in the dark, I realized this life is short
And deep down, I'm still a child
Playful eyes, wide and wild
I can't lose hope, what's left of my heart's still made of gold

[Pre-Chorus 2]
And I know that I'm still fucked up
But aren't we all, my love?
Darling, our scars make us who we are, are
So when the winds are howling strong
And you think you can't go on, hold tight, sweetheart

[Chorus 2]
You'll find a rainbow, rainbow, baby
Trust me, I know life is scary
But just put those colors on, girl
Come and play along with me tonight
You gotta learn to let go, put the past behind you
Trust me, I know, the ghosts will try to find you
But just put those colors on, girl
Come and paint the world with me tonight
Night, night, night, night, night

[Chorus 3]
I found a rainbow, rainbow, baby
Trust me, I know life is scary
But just put those colors on, girl
You gotta learn to let go, put the past behind you
Trust me, I know, the ghosts will try to find you
But just put those colors on, girl
Come and paint the world with me tonight
Oh, put those colors on, girl
Come and paint the world with me tonight
Come and paint the world with me tonight[Intro]
Rwar, rwar!

[Verse 1]
I have a heart, I swear I do
But just not baby, when it comes to you
I get so hungry when you say you love me
(Hush) if you know what's good for you
I think you're hot, I think you're cool
You're the kind of guy I'd stalk in school
But now that I'm famous, you're up my anus
Now I'm gonna eat you fool

[Pre-Chorus]
I eat boys up
Breakfast and lunch
Then when I'm thirsty, I drink their blood
Carnivore, animal, I am a cannibal
I eat boys up
You better run

[Chorus]
I am cannibal (Cannibal, cannibal, I am!)
I am cannibal (Cannibal, I'll eat you up, I am!)
I am cannibal (Cannibal, cannibal, I am!)
I am cannibal (Cannibal, I'll eat you up)

[Verse 2]
Whenever you tell me I'm pretty
That's when the hunger really hits me
Your little heart goes pitter-patter
I want your liver on a platter
Use your finger to stir my tea
And for dessert, I'll suck your teeth
Be too sweet, and you'll be a goner
(Yeah) I'll pull a Jeffrey Dahmer

[Pre-Chorus]
I eat boys up
Breakfast and lunch
Then when I'm thirsty, I drink their blood
Carnivore, animal, I am a cannibal
I eat boys up
You better run

[Chorus]
I am cannibal (Cannibal, cannibal, I am!)
I am cannibal (Cannibal, I'll eat you up, I am!)
I am cannibal (Cannibal, cannibal, I am!)
I am cannibal (Cannibal, I'll eat you up)

[Bridge]

[Outro]
I love you
I warned you
Rwar![Verse 1]
Been a prisoner of the past
Had a bitterness when I looked back
Was telling everyone it's not that bad
Til all my shit hit the fan

[Pre-Chorus]
I know I'm always like
Telling everybody you don't gotta be a victim
Life aint always fair, but hell is living in resentment
Choose redemption, your happy ending's up to you

[Chorus]
I think it's time to practice what I preach
Exorcise the demons inside me
Whoa, gotta learn to let it go
The past can't haunt me if I don't let it
Live and learn and never forget it
Whoa, gotta learn to let it go

[Verse 2]
Had a boogieman under my bed
Putting crazy thoughts inside my head
Always whispering, "It's all your fault"
He was telling me, "No, you're not that strong"

[Pre-Chorus]
I know I'm always like
Telling everybody you dont gotta be a victim
Life aint always fair, but hell is living in resentment
Choose redemption, your happy ending's up to you

[Chorus]
So, I think its time to practice what I preach
Exorcise the demons inside me
Whoa, gotta learn to let it go
The past can't haunt me if I don't let it
Live and learn and never forget it
Whoa, gotta learn to let it go

[Post-Chorus]
Hey-eh-eh-eh, yeah
Hey-eh-eh-eh, yeah
Learn to let go, learn to let go
Hey-eh-eh-eh, yeah
Hey-eh-eh-eh, yeah
Learn to let go, learn to let go

[Bridge]
I'm done reliving my bad decisions
I see now maybe theres a reason why
I've been through hell and back
Yeah, honestly, it's all made me who I am
Holding on to wasted time
Gotta learn to let go in life

[Chorus]
So, I think it's time to practice what I preach
Exorcise the demons inside me
Whoa, gotta learn to let it go
The past can't haunt me if I don't let it
Live and learn and never forget it
Whoa, gotta learn to let it go

[Post-Chorus]
Hey-eh-eh-eh, yeah
Hey-eh-eh-eh, yeah
Learn to let go, learn to let go
Hey-eh-eh-eh, yeah
Hey-eh-eh-eh, yeah
Learn to let go, learn to let go[Chorus]
I hear your heart beat to the beat of the drums
Oh, what a shame that you came here with someone
So while you're here in my arms
Let's make the most of the night, like we're gonna die young
We're gonna die young
We're gonna die young
Let's make the most of the night, like we're gonna die young
Let's make the most of the night, like we're gonna die young

[Verse 1]
Young hearts, out our minds

Living hard just like we should
Don't care who's watching when we tearing it up (You know)
That magic that we got, nobody can touch (Fo' sho')

[Verse 2]
Young hunks taking shots
Strippin' down to dirty socks
Music up, gettin' hot
Kiss me, give me all you've got
It's pretty obvious that you got a crush (You know)
That magic in your pants, it's making me blush (Fo' sho')

[Pre-Chorus]
Lookin' for some trouble tonight (Yeah)
Take my hand, I'll show you the wild side
Like it's the last night of our lives (Uh-huh)
We'll keep dancin' 'til we die

[Chorus]
I hear your heart beat to the beat of the drums
Oh, what a shame that you came here with someone
So while you're here in my arms
Let's make the most of the night, like we're gonna die young
I hear your heart beat to the beat of the drums
Oh, what a shame that you came here with someone
So while you're here in my arms
Let's make the most of the night, like we're gonna die young

[Outro]
We're gonna die young
We're gonna die young
Let's make the most of the night, like we're gonna die young[Verse 1]
I'm not a stranger to the dark
"Hide away," they say
"Cause we don't want your broken parts"
I've learned to be ashamed of all my scars
"Run away," they say
"No one will love you as you are"

[Pre-Chorus]
But I won't let them break me down to dust
I know that there's a place for us
For we are glorious

[Chorus]
When the sharpest words wanna cut me down
I'm gonna send a flood, gonna drown them out
I am brave, I am bruised
I am who I'm meant to be, this is me
Look out 'cause here I come
And I'm marching on to the beat I drum
I'm not scared to be seen
I make no apologies, this is me

[Post-Chorus]
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh, oh

[Verse 2]
Another round of bullets hits my skin
Well, fire away 'cause today, I won't let the shame sink in
We are bursting through the barricades
And reaching for the sun (We are warriors)
Yeah, that's what we've become

[Pre-Chorus]
Won't let them break me down to dust
I know that there's a place for us
For we are glorious

[Chorus]
When the sharpest words wanna cut me down
Gonna send a flood, gonna drown them out
I am brave, I am bruised
I am who I'm meant to be, this is me
Look out 'cause here I come
And I'm marching on to the beat I drum
I'm not scared to be seen
I make no apologies, this is me

[Post-Chorus]
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh, oh
This is me

[Bridge]
And I know that I deserve your love
'Cause there's nothing I'm not worthy of
When the sharpest words wanna cut me down
I'm gonna send a flood, gonna drown them out
This is brave, this is bruised
This is who I'm meant to be, this is me

[Chorus]
Look out 'cause here I come (Look out 'cause here I come)
And I'm marching on to the beat I drum (Marching on, marching, marching on)
I'm not scared to be seen
I make no apologies, this is me

[Outro]
Whenever the world's gone, whenever the world's gone
In the depths of my heart
Oh, oh, oh, this is me[Verse 1]
Even the stars and the moon don't shine quite like we do
Dreamers searchin' for the truth
Go on, read about us in the news
Pretty reckless, pretty wild
Talking shit, and we'll just smile
Don't you see these fuckin' crowns?
If you know what I mean, you on the team

[Chorus 1]
This is a hymn for the hymnless, kids with no religion
Yeah, we keep on sinning, yeah, we keep on singing
Flying down the highway, backseat of the Hyundai
Pull it to the front, let it run, we don't valet
Sorry if you're starstruck, blame it on the stardust
I know that I'm perfect, even though I'm fucked up
Hymn for the hymnless, don't need no forgiveness
'Cause if there's a heaven, don't care if we get in
This is a hymn, hymn, hymn for how we live, live, live
This is a hymn, hymn, hymn for how we live, for how we live

[Verse 2]
After all we've been through
No, we won't stand and salute
So we just ride, we just cruise
Livin' like there's nothing left to lose
If we die before we wake
Who we are is no mistake
This is just the way we're made
You know what I mean, you on the team

[Chorus 1]
This is a hymn for the hymnless, kids with no religion
Yeah, we keep on sinning, yeah, we keep on singing
Flying down the highway, backseat of the Hyundai
Pull it to the front, let it run, we don't valet
Sorry if you're starstruck, blame it on the stardust
I know that I'm perfect, even though I'm fucked up
Hymn for the hymnless, don't need no forgiveness
'Cause if there's a heaven, don't care if we get in
This is a hymn, hymn, hymn for how we live, live, live
This is a hymn, hymn, hymn for how we live, for how we live

[Chorus 2]
This is a hymn for the hymnless, kids with no religion
Yeah, we keep on sinning, yeah, we keep on singing
Flying down the highway, yeah, we do it our way
High as outer space, we don't hear what the rest say
Sorry if you're starstruck, blame it on the stardust
I know that I'm perfect, even though I'm fucked up
Hymn for the hymnless, don't need no forgiveness
'Cause if there's a heaven, don't care if we get in
This is a hymn, hymn, hymn for how we live, live, live
This is a hymn, hymn, hymn for how we live, for how we live[Intro: Kesha & Big Freedia]

Singing oh, mama raised me well
But I don't wanna go to Heaven without raisin' hell

[Outro: Kesha & Big Freedia]
Can I get an amen? (Ah)
This is for the misfits of creation (You're welcome, ah)
Take this as your holy validation (Come on)
You don't need to have your celebratin' (Sing it, Kesha, bitch)
This is our salvation[Hook]
I don't need you or your brand new Benz
Or your bougie friends
I don't need love looking like diamonds
Lookin' like diamonds

[Verse 1: Wiz Khalifa]
Okay, I'm young and Im tatted, I get them bucks like an addict
Rockin' this Christian Dior, I spend so much on my fabric
I got a wifey at home and what she wants she can have it
And she in love with my stick, she say I work it like magic
Okay, now no need to panic, I'm on a beach where the sand is
Somewhere smokin' on medication, no, I won't need a bandage
Some would look at my age and try to say I'm young and I'm handsome
I say I'm filthy fuckin' rich, so I'm an old dirty bastard
And my crib's a disaster and my kush is the master
I was in my yellow car, but my Ferrari go faster
Soundin' like a band in it and my diamonds the dancers
On the remix with Kesha, 'bout to go see the cashier
On the grind, so now my watch has got a lot of diamonds in it
I look down and see a hundred thou' and think it's time to get it
Brought a lot of marijauna and I'm here to share it
No, its not a problem, better get it, then I won't be here tomorrow, lil' mama
Tahahahahahaaa!

[Hook]
I don't need you or your brand new Benz
Or your bougie friends
I don't need love looking like diamonds
Lookin' like diamonds
I don't need you or your brand new Benz
Or your bougie friends
I don't need love looking like diamonds
Lookin' like diamonds

[Verse 2: Andr 3000]
We start out so cute in our baby pictures
That momma shot for our daddy, so that he wouldn't forget you
He forgot anyway, but hey, one day he'll remember
If not, he's human, I'm human, you human, we'll forgive him
God gives him his ultimatum, can't see how momma hates him
He's such a cool ass guy, then wonder why she date him
I'm only eight, I'm not old enough, guess it's complicated
Two parent dwellings, expellin' have got so underrated
I only say this in cadence, so it don't get negated
I was gon' save it for later, but later look like maybe
This crazy lady named Kesha is guessing my Mercedes
Would be all new and frou-frou, but it's the 1980s
But now that we are cool-cool, she sippin' Irish Baileys
She say, "Stacks, youre true blue?" I said, "nah, Im Navy"
I call her "Keisha," she like it because it's hood to her
She call me "Andr 6000" because I'm good to her

[Hook]
I dont need you or your brand new Benz
Or your bougie friends
I dont need love looking like diamonds
Lookin' like diamonds
I don't need you or your brand new Benz
Or your bougie friends
I don't need love looking like diamonds
Lookin' like diamonds (well, damn!)

[Verse 3: T.I.]
Hey Ke$ha, what up boo, it's me, do you know what to do wit me?
Bad bitches, I got 2 with me, wit you, better make it two or three
Bad bitches know me, so don't bother introducin' me
They want me more than diamonds
Wipe me down bitch, Im super clean
Im hella cold, mega paid, making moves doing things
Bitches stay queued and they all wanna do the king
Im boiling, royalty, knew it when I seen her
I was gonna take her, make her my new royal penis cleaner
My demeanor something special and this dick is so impressive
Bitch I bet you'd take it off and take it with you if I let you
I ain't trippin, Im just here, they couldnt catch you and I got you
Bitch my swag on supernatural, get you pregnant looking at you
I ain't nothing like them other dudes, Im an atom bomb, they a molecule
Still paid, ballin out the frame, stuntin like a fool

[Hook]
I dont need you or your brand new Benz
Or your bougie friends
I dont need love looking like diamonds
Looking like diamonds
I don't need you or your brand new Benz
Or your bougie friends
I don't need love looking like diamonds
Lookin' like diamonds

[Bridge: Ke$ha]
Rat tat tat tat on your dumb dumb drum
The beat's so fat gonna make me cum/come
Um, um, um, um
Over to to your place
Rat tat tat tat on your dumb dumb drum
The beat's so fat gonna make me cum/come
Um, um, um, um
Over to to your place

[Verse 4: Lil Wayne]
Uh, we be on that shit that no one be on, that's what we on
Smoke that neon, Kings of Leon, Dynamite, Napoleon
Got some skinnies and a T on and some Vans
And my man's got the ratchet
While I'm laying in some pussy you'll be laying in a casket
I'm just saying, I'm just spazzing, I'm just smashing, I'm just nasty
If you bout it, bust it open, oh you fancy
Man I got so many flows like a mansion, catch a tantrum
Know a girl named Cleopatra, she'll throw that pussy at ya
I'm financially straight like a line, I ain't lyin
And all my hoes on they toes, ballerina, Black Swan
And we on that Ciroc, Grey Goose, Pat-rn
It's Weezy baby; Sleazy, baby, YEAH!
(Young Moola baby!)

[Hook]
I dont need you or your brand new Benz
Or your bougie friends
I dont need love looking like diamonds
Looking like diamonds
I dont need you or your brand new Benz
Or your bougie friends
I dont need love looking like diamonds
Looking like diamonds (Get sleazy)[Verse 1]
I always said when I'm gone, when Im dead
Don't lay me down with the dirt on my head
You won't need a shovel, you dont need a cold headstone
You don't need to cry, I'm gon' be going home

[Chorus]
I'm waiting for my spaceship to come back to me
It's coming back for me
I don't really care if you believe it's coming back for me, yeah
Living in a lonesome galaxy
But in my dreams, I see them come n rescue me
Look up in the sky and there theyll be
I bet you'll think of me then
Youre gonna say, "Ooh, look at that, oh yeah, yeah"
Damn, if it ain't true
They're coming back for me, they're coming back for me, yeah

[Verse 2]
I knew from the start I dont belong in these parts
There's too much hate, there's too much hurt for this heart
Lord knows this planet feels like a hopeless place
Thank God I'm going back home to outer space

[Chorus]
I'm waiting for my spaceship to come back to me
It's coming back for me
I don't really care if you believe it's coming back for me, yeah
Living in a lonesome galaxy
But in my dreams, I see them come 'n rescue me
Look up in the sky and there they'll be
I bet you'll think of me then
You're gonna say, "Ooh, look at that, oh yeah, yeah"
Damn, if it ain't true
They're coming back for me, they're coming back for me, yeah

[Chorus]
I'm waiting for my spaceship to come back for me
And I don't really care if you believe me
Living in a lonesome galaxy
But in my dreams, I see them come 'n rescue me
Look up in the sky and there they'll be
I bet you'll think of me then
You're gonna say, "Ooh, look at that, oh yeah, yeah"
Damn, if it ain't true
They're coming back for me, they're coming back for me, yeah

[Outro]
As I leave this Earth and sail into the infinite cosmic universe, the wars, the triumphs, the beauty, and the bloodshed, the ocean of human endeavor, it all grows quiet, insignificant. I'm nothing more than recycled stardust and borrowed energy, born from a rock, spinning in the aether. I watch my life backwards and forwards and I feel free. Nothing is real, love is everything, and I know nothing.[Intro]
There's a place downtown where the freaks all come around
It's a hole in the wall, it's a dirty free for all
When they...

[Verse 1]
When the dark of the night
Comes around, that's the time
That the animal comes alive
Looking for something wild

[Pre-Chorus 1]
And now we lookin' like pimps in my gold Trans Am
Got a water bottle full of whiskey in my handbag
Got my drunk text on, I'll regret it in the morning
But tonight, I don't give a (I don't give a, I don't give a...)

[Chorus]
There's a place downtown where the freaks all come around
It's a hole in the wall, it's a dirty free for all
And they turn me on when they take it off
When they take it off, everybody take it off
There's a place I know if you're looking for a show
Where they go hardcore and there's glitter on the floor
And they turn me on when they take it off
When they take it off, everybody take it off

[Verse 2]
Lose your mind, lose it now
Lose your clothes in the crowd
We're delirious, tear it down
'Til the sun comes back around

[Pre-Chorus 2]
N-now we looking so smashed, knockin' over trash cans
E'rybody breakin' bottles, it's a filthy hot mess
And I'm gonna get faded, I'm not the designated driver
So, I don't give a (I don't give a, I don't give a...)

[Chorus]
There's a place downtown where the freaks all come around
It's a hole in the wall, it's a dirty free for all
And they turn me on when they take it off
When they take it off, everybody take it off
There's a place I know if you're looking for a show
Where they go hardcore and there's glitter on the floor
And they turn me on when they take it off
When they take it off, everybody take it off

[Breakdown]
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh
(Everybody take it off)
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh
(Everybody take it off)

[Bridge]
Right now (Take it off)
Right now (Take it off)
Right now (Take it off), oh-oh
Right now (Take it off)
Right now (Take it off)
Right now (Take it off, everybody take it off), oh-oh

[Chorus]
There's a place downtown where the freaks all come around
It's a hole in the wall, it's a dirty free for all
And they turn me on when they take it off
When they take it off, everybody take it off
There's a place I know if you're looking for a show
Where they go hardcore and there's glitter on the floor
And they turn me on when they take it off
When they take it off, everybody take it off[Intro]
One, two, three, four, one

[Verse 1]
I got too many people (da-da-da, da) I got left to prove wrong
All those motherfuckers (da-da-da, da) been too mean for too long
And I'm so sick of crying, yeah
Darling, whats it for?
I could fight forever, oh, but life's too short

[Chorus]
Don't let the bastards get you down, oh no
Dont let the assholes wear you out
Don't let the mean girls take the crown
Don't let the scumbags screw you 'round
Don't let the bastards take you down

[Verse 2]
Been underestimated my entire life
I know people gonna talk shit, and darling, that's fine
But they won't break my spirit, I won't let em win
Ill just keep on living, keep on living, oh
The way I wanna live

[Chorus]
Don't let the bastards get you down, oh no
Dont let the assholes wear you out
Don't let the mean girls take the crown
Don't let the scumbags screw you 'round
Dont let the bastards get you down

[Chorus]
Don't let the bastards get you down, oh no
Don't let the assholes wear you out
Don't let the mean girls take your crown
Don't let the scumbags screw you 'round
Don't let the bastards take you down

[Bridge]
Na na na, la da da da da da, na na hey, na na hey
Na na na, la da da da da da, na na hey, na na hey
Na na na, la da da da da da, na na hey, na na hey
Na na na, la da da da da da, na na hey, na na hey

[Outro]
So was that a good one?
Should we go again?[Verse 1]
Maybe I need some rehab
Or maybe just need some sleep
I got a sick obsession
I'm seeing it in my dreams
I'm looking down every alley
I'm making those desperate calls
I'm staying up all night hoping
Hitting my head against the wall

[Pre-Chorus]
What you've got, boy, is hard to find
I think about it all the time
I'm all strung out, my heart is fried
I just can't get you off my mind

[Chorus]
Because your love, your love, your love is my drug
Your love, your love, your love
I said your love, your love, your love is my drug
Your love, your love, your love

[Verse 2]
Won't listen to any advice
Momma's telling me I should think twice
Better left to my own devices
I'm addicted, it's a crisis
My friends think I've gone crazy
My judgment's getting kinda hazy
My steeze is gonna be affected
If I keep it up like a lovesick crackhead

[Pre-Chorus]
What you've got, boy, is hard to find
I think about it all the time
I'm all strung out, my heart is fried
I just can't get you off my mind

[Chorus]
Because your love, your love, your love is my drug
Your love, your love, your love
I said your love, your love, your love is my drug
Your love, your love, your love

[Bridge]
I don't care what people say
The rush is worth the price I pay
I get so high when you're with me
But crash and crave you when you leave

[Verse 3]
Hey, so I got a question
Do you wanna have a slumber party in my basement?
Do I make your heart beat like an 808 drum?
Is my love your drug? Your drug
Huh, your drug
Huh, your drug
Is my love your drug?

[Chorus]
Because your love, your love, your love is my drug
Your love, your love, your love
I said your love, your love, your love is my drug
Your love, your love, your love
Because your love, your love, your love is my drug
Your love, your love, your love
I said your love, your love, your love is my drug
Your love, your love, your love

[Outro]
Hey
Hey, so...
Your love, your love, your love, your love is my drug
I like your beard[Verse 1]
I feel loved, darling, I feel used
Nobody makes me feel the way you do
And sometimesI,sometimes I, sometimesI just can't stand it
Isn't thatjust the thing about us?
I'm still thinking you could be the one
But you're always, you're always, you're always taking me for granted

[Pre-Chorus]
I got something I gotta get off of my chest
I've been staying up while you're sleeping in my bed

[Chorus]
I don't hate you, babe, it's worse than that
'Cause you hurt me and I don't react
I've been building up this thing for months
Oh, resentment

[Verse 2]
I know you better than you know yourself
And there's a part of you that you won't help
You say you can't do it, just do it, just do it for my sake
It's a shame knowing we could be good
That you could treat me better if you really wanted to
And if you can't do it for my sake, then do it for our sake

[Chorus]
I don't hate you, babe, it's worse than that
'Cause you hurt me and I don't react
I've been building up this thing for months
Oh, resentment

[Bridge]
Don't know how to leave or how to stay
So I've been talking to strangers
'Cause I can't talk to you anymore that way
Did I let you down? 'Cause you let me down
But you would never say that I let you down
But you let me down, you let me down

[Chorus]
But I don't hate you, babe, it's worse than that
'Cause you hurt me and I'm more than sad
I've been building up this thing for months
Oh, resentment[Verse 1: Juicy J]
Uh
Everybody know Juicy always turnt up
Tour bus smoked out, everybody purped up
Nine to five grind and got the whole hood worked up
Ain't getting money, then you better get your work up
Pull up in a Porsche drunk, backseat chauffeur
Taylor Gang in here, everybody know us
Hundred bottles, and there's more coming
Same shit tomorrow night, all I know is stunting
20 shot of Jager, I don't do chasers
White boy wasted
Smoking out the vaper
Party with your girl, sweating out my pores
Becky so good, I had to thank the Lord
She won my heart, in the club she go hard
Shake her ass and titties
I threw my card
Love California girls like David Lee Roth
You tell 'em that you love em
I say, 'Take it off'

[Chorus: Kesha]
I hear your heart beat to the beat of the drums
Oh, what a shame that you came here with someone
So while you're here in my arms
Let's make the most of the night like we're gonna die young
We're gonna die young
We're gonna die young
Let's make the most of the night like we're gonna die young

[Post-Chorus: Becky G]
Whoa-oh, whoa-oh

Whoa-oh, whoa-oh

Like we're gonna die young
Let's make the most of the night like we're gonna die young

[Verse 2: Wiz Khalifa]
Uh
No changing us
Ball so hard, it's not a game to us
Pull up in the club throwing Taylor's up
Spending cause money ain't a thing to us
But for the famous stuff
I wasn't the one to play with
Party all night, getting drunk and ragin'
Ball so hard, I think I'm gon' be sick
Wake up, roll a joint and do it all again
Yeah, I like to party
Got a cute face and I like your body
You leave sober and you might be sorry
Pour another shot then light the Marley
And what goes down, don't bring it up
Tell them broke niggas they can hang it up
Take six shots, feels like we're dying
Hit this once, feels like you're flying

[Chorus: Kesha & Becky G, Both]
I hear your heart beat to the beat of the drums
Oh, what a shame that you came here with someone
So while you're here in my arms
Let's make the most of the night like we're gonna die young

[Verse 3: Becky G]
Won't stop cause it's my time, time
I'm stayin' on my grind, grind
You tryna take my shine, shine?
Step back, bye bye
When I rap, all the boys go cray cray
Every time that I jump on the stage
Oh, you like it when I'm in your face?
And if you don't, man
Whatcha gonna say?

[Pre-Chorus: Ke$ha]
Looking for some trouble tonight (yeah)
Take my hand, I'll show you the wild side
Like it's the last night of our lives (uh-huh)
We'll keep dancing 'till we die

[Chorus: Kesha]

Oh, what a shame that you came here with someone
So while you're here in my arms
Let's make the most of the night like we're gonna die young
I hear your heart beat to the beat of the drums
Oh, what a shame that you came here with someone
So while you're here in my arms
Let's make the most of the night like we're gonna die young

Woke up this morning, feeling myself
Hungover as hell like 2012, fuck it

But life's a bitch,so come on, shake your tits and fuck it"
What's a girl to do? What's a girl to do?

But could you kinda rap and not be so sad?" Fuck it

Caught up in my feelings; bitch, shut up and sing

You could ride a unicorn to school
And if you fall off, you'd have healthcare
(No, you dont)
And if you finish school, you'd go to college for free
That makes sense and that's fair
(No, its not)
And if you were a lady
Then you own your lady parts
Just like a man goes to a dealership
And then he owns a car

[Refrain]
Vroom, vroom
Fuck you (Fuck you)

[Pre-Chorus]
What if life as we knew it was over?
Guess what? God is a woman, I know her

Didn't rule the world anymore?
(Hahahahahahahahaha)
What if rich, white, straight men
Didn't rule the world anymore?

[Verse 2]
If you're from another land, then come here
You won't have to climb a wall
(Yes, you will!)
And if you are a boy who loves a boy
You'll get a wedding cake and all
(Not in Colorado!)
And if you are a lady and you do your lady work
Then you will make as many dollars as the boys
Not just two thirds

[Refrain]
Cha-ching
Fuck you (Fuck you)

[Pre-Chorus]
What if life as we knew it was over?
Guess what? God is a woman, I know her

What if rich, white, straight men
Didn't rule the world anymore?

When weve got our hot-pants on and up

I wanna lay in your arms when the world is burning
I wanna dig in your heart, take away your hurting
Kiss me and tell me I'm fine and forget were dying
I wanna feel you tonight like the very first time
Let's run away, baby, drive straight into the moonlight
Kiss me and tell me you're mine like no ones watching

I have boys in every country code
Just a rollin' stoner on a roll
I'd bring the cowgirl out and cock them guns
Always leave before the cowboy comes

[Pre-Chorus]
Then I met you Saturday night, I tried to run away
Sunday morning, I woke up fucked up, with you right next to me
Had a flight booked to Japan, but you took me by the hand
Now every morning I wake up with you right next to me

[Chorus]
I'm walking on air, kickin' my blues
Everything stops when I'm with you
So slide over here, tell me the truth
I know you love me wearing nothing but your boots

[Post-Chorus]
Ah oh, ah oh, ah oh, oh
Ah oh, ah oh, ah oh, oh

Never thought about that wifey life
Wedding bells just made me wanna die
But when you grab me and you spin me 'round
You really screw my head up upside-down

[Pre-Chorus]
Then I met you Saturday night, I tried to run away
Sunday morning, I woke up fucked up, with you right next to me

What do you get when you take Godzilla to the mall?
He scares all the children and shreds all the pillows
And knocks over walls
His emerald eyes, they sparkle and shine
As he eats the food court and steals half my fries
That's what you get when you take Godzilla to the mall

[Verse 2]
What do you get when you take Godzilla to meet your mom?
He rings the bell and she looks out the window, and calls the cops
I try to explain that he's mostly tame
As long as there's pizza and video games
That's what you get when you take Godzilla to meet your mom

[Bridge]
While everyone else is running and screaming
I just love being with you
I guess they don't see all the things that I'm seein'
That make you so uniquely you, you, you, you

Kinda sweet stuff, kinda freaky-deaky shit
You can trust me, I can be a kinky bitch
Say you can't turn a ho into a housewife
Who wants a housewife who ain't a ho sometimes?
I like it kinda slow and sweet sometimes
I like it when you're beggin' on your knees sometimes
I like it in the bed or the car
In the kitchen or the bar, at your best friends party

[Chorus: Kesha]
Baby, you're my lover
We can go find some others
As long as it's not a secret
We can keep it kinky

Now we're looking for some trouble like we huntin' for treasure

Okay, we stayin' up tonight, there's no turnin' back
I got my shorties up so high, bet y'all think I'm runnin' track
Just found out me and Elton John have the same shoes, that's a fact
Hey Chelsea, do you mind if I put this wine in your backpack?

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm gettin' so drunk
Haven't seen my boyfriend in a few months
Oh, don't know if it's weed or if it's a skunk
Me and all my girls are fuckin' on one, yeah (Woo)

[Chorus]
Tonight's the best night of our lives
Can you feel it? I can feel it

Badda-da-dah, badda-da-bah-bah
Coming out'cha mouth with'cha blah, blah, blah
Zip your lip like a padlock
And meet me in the back with the Jack at the jukebox
I don't really care where you live at
Just turn around boy, let me hit that
Don't be a little bitch with your chit chat
Just show me where your dick's at

[Pre-Chorus: Kesha]

[Verse 2: Kesha]
Boy, c'mon and get my rocks off
Come put a little love in my glove box
Wanna dance, with no pants on?

'Cause I know you don't care what my middle name is
I wanna be naked and you're wasted

It only matters who I is

[Chorus: Kesha]
Stop ta-ta-talking that blah, blah, blah
Think you'll be getting this?

Now you're one of us
You're coming with me

Dirt and glitter cover the floor
We're pretty and sick
We're young and we're bored

[Pre-Chorus 2]
It's time to lose your mind and let the crazy out

You can't imagine the immensity of the fuck I'm not giving
About your money and manservants at the mansion you live in
And I don't wanna go places where all my ladies can't get in
Just grab a bottle, some boys, and let's take it back to my basement and get sleazy
Sick of all your lines, so cheesy
Sorry, daddy, but I'm not that easy
I'm not gonna sit here while you circle jerk it and work it

[Verse 2]
I-I-I don't mean to critique on your seduction technique
B-b-but your money's not impressing me, it's kinda weak
Th-th-that you really think you're gonna get my rocks off
Get my top and socks off by showing me the dollars in your drop box
Me and all my friends, we don't buy bottles, we bring 'em
We take the drinks from the tables when you get up and leave 'em
And I don't care if you stare and you call us scummy
'Cause we ain't after your affection and sure as hell not your money, honey

I don't need you or your brand new Benz

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Feeling like I'm a high schooler
Sipping on a warm wine cooler
Hot, 'cause the party don't stop
I'm in a crop top, like I'm working at Hooters
We been keeping it PG
But I wanna get a little frisky
Come, give me some of that yum, like a lollipop
Let me set you free

Write our names on the wall in the back of the bar
Steal some bubblegum from the corner mexi mart
Yeah, we laughing like kids causing trouble in the dark
Causing trouble in the dark
Trou-trou-trouble in the dark

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Feeling like a sabertooth tiger
Sipping on a warm Budweiser
Touch me and gimme that rush

But I wanna get it on fo' sure
Come, give me some of the yum, like a lollipop

Let's go for it just for tonight
C'mon, c'mon, c'mon[Verse 1: Kesha; Both]
Downtown tonight, I saw an old friend, someone who
I used to take comfort from long before I met you
I caught a spark in his eyes of forgotten desire
With a word, or a touch, I could've rekindled that fire

[Chorus: Kesha & Dolly Parton]
But old flames can't hold a candle to you
No one can light up the night like you do
Flickering embers of love
I've known one or two
But old flames can't hold a candle to you
Oh, yeah, ooh

[Verse 2: Dolly Parton & Kesha & Both]
But sometimes at night, I think of old lovers I've known
And I remember how holding them helped me not feel so alone
(feel so alone)
Then I feel you beside me, and even their memories are gone
Like stars in the night, lost in the sweet light of dawn

[Chorus: Kesha & Dolly Parton]
Oh, but old flames can't hold a candle to you
No one can light up the night like you do
Flickerin' embers of love
I've known one or two
But old flames can't hold a candle to you
But old flames can't hold a candle to you
Oh, yeah[Verse 1: Kesha & Tayla Parx]
Oh, I remember every time we used to be together (Woo)
Yeah, we were ride-or-die, weevenused to peetogether (Yep)
I used to be theshoulder that you would cry on (Uh-huh)
When Polly fucked you over, I'm the one you'd rely on (That's right)
When it all began, I was your biggest fan
You gone and fucked it over over half a man (Haha)
I'm writing this on a yacht in the French Riviera
Delete my number, bitch, sayonara (Sayonara)

[Pre-Chorus: Kesha & Tayla Parx]
That's girl code, baby girl
And you broke the golden rule
I guess I'll see you never, so bye bye

[Chorus: Kesha & Tayla Parx, Tayla Parx & Kesha]
Honey (Woo)
You can have my sloppy seconds if you really need (Take it)
Find my pictures under "legends" if you Google me (Yup)
And he's only sleeping with you, trying to get to me (That's so funny, right?)
It's so easy, you're dead to me, oh (I still can't believe; Right? Yeah, ok)

[Post-Chorus]
Eh, eh, eh, woah
Eh, eh, eh, woah

[Verse 2: Kesha, Tayla Parx & Both]
I don't talk shit unless it's true
You smell that? (Yeah) Damn, it must be you
I don't have a crystal ball, but I always knew
You would stab me in the back with your stripper shoe (Woo-hoo)
Even my friends thought that it was weird (So weird)
When you'd be coming over even when I wasn't here
You're just a copycat, but no one's buying that
Up on the discount rack, right at the back of a TJ Maxx

[Pre-Chorus: Kesha & Tayla Parx, Kesha & Tayla Parx]
That's girl code, baby girl
And you broke the golden rule
I guess I'll see you never, so bye bye (Bye, bye bye, bye)

[Chorus: Kesha & Tayla Parx, Tayla Parx & Kesha]
Honey
You can have my sloppy seconds if you really need (Bye bye)
Find my pictures under "legends" if you Google me (Google me, bitch, Google me, bitch)
And he's only sleeping with you, trying to get to me (Me)
It's so easy, you're dead to me, oh (Uh)

[Post-Chorus]
Eh, eh, eh, woah
Eh, eh, eh, woah

[Bridge: Kesha]
Honey, mm
You were more to me, you were more like family
When you were under attack, had your back
You were more than a friend to me
It was us against the world, you were my girl
I still can't believe you did this to me, oh

[Chorus: Kesha & Tayla Parx, Tayla Parx & Kesha]
Honey
You can have my sloppy seconds if you really need (Bye bye)
Find my pictures under "legends" if you Google me (Google me, bitch, Google me, bitch)
And he's only sleeping with you, trying to get to me (Me)
It's so easy, you're dead to me, oh (Uh)

[Post-Chorus]

Oh, oh, oh

[Verse 1]
Alright
Some people, they got the big brains
They make all the computer games
Some people, they look so sexy
Pop and fizzle like a Pepsi
Some people, they got the money
Drive around in Lamborghinis
I don't need any of those things
I just wanna dance like a motherfucker, yeah

[Chorus]
Ha!
Wanna go get down
You wanna come with me?
My moves are world-renowned
So good, you won't believe
Oh, oh, oh

Or are you scared of these boogie feet?

[Verse 2]
Some people, seem mean and nasty
But I think they're just unhappy
The body needs a good shakin'
To let the brain fill up with the good vibrations

[Chorus]
Ha!
Wanna go get down?
You wanna come with me?
My moves are world-renowned
So good, you won't believe
Oh, oh, oh
Dance with me, dance with me, please

[Outro: Kesha & Both]
Why waste your time in your mind?
There's no wrong, there's no right
Koo koo bananas unite (You got it)
Life's a hello, a goodbye
The last laugh, then you die
I boogie 'cause I'm alive (You got it)
Are you scared of these boogie feet?[Intro]
God, I'm only human, trying to face it all
But I don't want to get emotional

[Verse 1]
It started in November, I started losing my mind
I ended up in rehab, I don't want to cry
But people can be so mean, and I don't understand why
And when they say I can't sing, I just want to die

[Pre-Chorus]
Trying to keep my shit together
When will this get any better?
I'm trying so hard not to break down

[Chorus]
God, I'm only human, trying to face it all
But I don't want to get emotional
Been walking on a tightrope, trying not to fall
But I don't want to get emotional

[Verse 2]
I didn't mean to do this, didn't mean to sell out
Got everything I ever thought I wanted, now I can't get out
I saw the love of my life leave me for his new wife
Stab me right in the heart with a fucking knife

[Pre-Chorus]
Trying to keep my shit together
When will this get any better?
I'm trying so hard not to break down

[Chorus]
God, I'm only human, trying to face it all
But I don't want to get emotional
Been walking on a tightrope, trying not to fall
But I don't want to get emotional

[Bridge]
I'm driving back home through the canyon
There's only so much that I can handle
Nobody knows it, nobody knows it
I never show it, I never show it
I'm supposed to be the girl that never does this
I'm supposed to be some party girl that stands for nothing
Nobody knows it, nobody knows it
I'm about to lose it, I'm about to lose it

[Chorus]
God, I'm only human, trying to face it all
But I don't want to get emotional
Been walking on a tightrope, trying not to fall
But I don't want to get emotional[Verse 1]
I feel so good, why you so mad?
And I'm so happy, and you hate that
ButIlove love, andI love life
And I love trippingin the desert with my best friends
Seeing spaceships in the sky

[Pre-Chorus]
And I love singing "fuck" in all my songs
'Cause the only people who got time to get offended
Are the ones who've probably never gotten off

[Chorus]
So get your shadow out of my sunshine
Out of my blue skies, out of my good times
So get your darkness out of my damn way
I'll be dancing in the rain
I'ma love you even though you hate me
I'ma love you even though you hate

[Verse 2]
We all got shit, who's to throw stones?
Live and let live, or just stay the fuck home
So if you love love (If you love love), if you love life (If you love life)
Then we can share this blue Dodge van and end this in the night sky

[Pre-Chorus]
And if you love partying, then party on
And if you're here to throw shade
Then you're in the wrong place
Yeah, you're blocking my sun

[Chorus]
Go get your shadow out of my sunshine
Out of my blue skies, out of my good times
So get your darkness out of my damn way
I'll be dancing in the rain
I'ma love you even though you hate me
I'ma love you even though you hate

[Bridge]
I'll just keep on doing what I do best
Pissing off people who wanna be pissed
Hate is the poison, love's the elixir
If you don't like me you can suck my
(Can suck my, can suck my, can suck my)

[Chorus]
So get your shadow out of my sunshine
Out of my blue skies, out of my good times
So get your darkness out of my damn way
I'll be dancing in the rain
I'ma love you even though you hate me
I'ma love you even though you hate
I'ma love you even though you hate me
I'ma love you even though you hate
I'ma love you even though you hate me
I'ma love you even though you hate[Verse 1]
You like the way I look, you like what's in my head
You like the way I talk, my American accent
You like the way I dress, you like the way I walk
You say you think it's hot 'cause I'm a motherfucking boss
You like the way I drive, vroom, vroom, vroom
I shake my booty like boom, boom, boom
You never met a girl like this before
You never met a girl like this before, ah, oh

[Pre-Chorus]
Well, baby, you get better and better
The more I get to know ya, get to know ya, oh
It's impossible to get you outta my head (Oh, hey)
And I keep fighting and fighting the feeling
But I want ya, but I want ya, oh
I know I'm gonna love it, but we haven't even done it yet

[Chorus]
I know we're both thinking
I wanna get you in your birthday suit
Who's gonna be the first to make the move?
You got any secret tattoos?
Ooh, goddamn, baby
Ooh, goddamn
I wanna get you in your birthday suit
Is it gonna happen in a hotel room?
You know I only got eyes for you
Ooh, goddamn, baby
Ooh, goddamn

[Post-Chorus]
God, I wanna get you in your birthday suit
Ba-ba-da-da-day, ah
God, I wanna get you in your birthday suit
Ba-ba-da-da-day, ah
You know that I only got eyes for you
Ba-ba-da-da-day, ah
God, I wanna get you in your birthday suit, ah

[Verse 2]
Ayy, ayy, I like the way you are, I kinda wanna play
You got a game, boy, boy, wanna race me?
You got a stupid car, it really makes me laugh
You can have a headstart, you still come in last
Back and forth like ping ping pong
You ring my bell like ding ding dong
Never met a man like you before
Never met a man like you before, ah, oh

[Pre-Chorus]
Well, baby, you get better and better
The more I get to know ya, get to know ya, oh
It's impossible to get you outta my head (Oh, hey)
And I keep fighting and fighting the feeling
But I want ya, but I want ya, oh
I know I'm gonna love it, but we haven't even done it yet

[Chorus]
I know we're both thinking
I wanna get you in your birthday suit
Who's gonna be the first to make the move?
You got any secret tattoos?
Ooh, goddamn, baby

Bum, bum, dum
Da-da, da-da, da-da, ow[Chorus]
Oh, I wish my heart wasn't broken from the start
I never stood a fightin' chance
Inallmy days, frommy cradle to my grave
I'll neverhave a father-daughter dance

[Verse 1]
There was always drama
I'm sorry I'm always so anxious
And I'm just sorry I'm fucked up
I really just don't know how to love, how to trust
I tried, but when I talk about him, I should probably cry, but
He's nothing, he's no one, a stranger

[Chorus]
Oh, I wish my heart wasn't broken from the start
I never stood a fightin' chance
In all my days, from my cradle to my grave
I'll never have a father-daughter dance

[Verse 2]
I'm never alone, but God, I'm so lonely
Fuck up my phone, hopin' it'll help me with my anxiety, but it don't
I don't even know if I wanna have kids
I don't wanna fuck 'em up the way you did
And sometimes I wonder, if I'd had a dad
Would he have protected me from all the bad shit? The bad men?
Would I even be the same person?

[Bridge]
Somebody to help with a flat tire
Somebody to walk me down the aisle
Somebody to help with a flat tire
Somebody to walk me down the aisle
The worst part of this is I'm not even sad
How do I miss something I never had?

[Chorus]
Oh, I wish my heart wasn't broken from the start
I never really stood a fightin' chance
In all my days, from my cradle to my grave
I'll never have a father-daughter dance

[Outro]
And everyone has pain up to their eyes
I'm sure that at the time you tried your best
But all of this has made me who I am
Without that father-daughter dance[Pre-Chorus: Logic]
I've been on the low, I been taking my time
I feel like I'm out of my mind
It feel like my life ain't mine (Who can relate? Woo)
I've been on the low, I been taking my time
I feel like I'm out of my mind
It feel like my life ain't mine

[Chorus: Logic]
I don't wanna be alive, I don't wanna be alive
I just wanna die today, I just wanna die
I don't wanna be alive, I don't wanna be alive
I just wanna die
And let me tell you why

[Verse 1: Logic]
All this other shit I'm talkin' 'bout, they think they know it
I've been praying for somebody to save me, no one's heroic
And my life don't even matter, I know it, I know it
I know I'm hurting deep down, but can't show it
I never had a place to call my own
I never had a home, ain't nobody callin' my phone
Where you been? Where you at? What's on your mind?
They say every life precious but nobody care about mine

[Pre-Chorus: Logic]
I've been on the low, I been taking my time
I feel like I'm out of my mind
It feel like my life ain't mine (Who can relate? Woo)
I've been on the low, I been taking my time
I feel like I'm out of my mind
It feel like my life ain't mine

[Chorus: Logic]
I want you to be alive, I want you to be alive
You don't gotta die today, you don't gotta die
I want you to be alive, I want you to be alive
You don't gotta die, now let me tell you why

[Verse 2: Alessia Cara]
It's the very first breath when your head's been drowning underwater
And it's the lightness in the air when you're there chest-to-chest with a lover
It's holding on, though the road's long, seeing light in the darkest things
And when you stare at your reflection, finally knowing who it is
I know that you'll thank God you did

[Verse 3: Logic]
I know where you been, where you are, where you goin'
I know you're the reason I believe in life
What's the day without a little night?
I'm just tryna shed a little light
It can be hard
It can be so hard
But you gotta live right now
You got everything to give right now

[Pre-Chorus: Logic]
I've been on the low, I been taking my time
I feel like I'm out of my mind
It feel like my life ain't mine (Who can relate? Woo)
I've been on the low, I been taking my time
I feel like I'm out of my mind
It feel like my life ain't mine

[Chorus: Logic]
I finally wanna be alive, I finally wanna be alive
I don't wanna die today, I don't wanna die
I finally wanna be alive, I finally wanna be alive
I don't wanna die, I don't wanna die

[Outro: Khalid]
Pain don't hurt the same, I know
The lane I travel feels alone
But I'm moving 'til my legs give out
And I see my tears melt in the snow
But I don't wanna cry, I don't wanna cry anymore
I wanna feel alive, I don't even wanna die anymore
Oh, I don't wanna
I don't wanna
I don't even wanna die anymore[Intro: Smokey Legendary, Logic & Both]
Son, you know why you the greatest alive?
Why, Dad?
Because you came out of my balls, nigga
Hahahahahaha
(Roof!)

[Chorus: Logic]
Fuck rap
Bustin' like an addict with a semi-automatic
Who done had it, and he ready for anybody to buck back
Hold up, catch a vibe, ain't no way in hell we leavin' nobody alive
Leave a suicide note, fuck that
Bobby feelin' villainous, he killin' this
I'm comin' for your man and his lady and even the baby
I'm feelin' like I'm, chika-chika-chika, Slim Shady with rabies

[Verse 1: Logic]
I'm foamin' at the mouth, ain't nobody takin' me out
Every single rapper in the industry, yeah, they know what I'm about
And I dare you to test me
'Cause not a single one of you motherfuckers impress me
And maybe that's a little bit of an exaggeration
But I'm full of innovation
And I'm tired of all of this high school "He's cool, he's not" rap shit
Can a single one of you motherfuckers even rap? Shit
No, this ain't a diss to the game, this a gas to the flame
Nowadays, everybody sound the same, shit's lame
Like a moth to the flame, I'ma reel 'em in and kill 'em
Know you feelin' lyricism when I'm spillin' it, I'm feelin' myself
Yeah, yeah, Bobby Boy, he be feelin' himself
Mass murder like this can't be good for my health
When I rap like this, do I sound like shit?
Well, it don't really matter, 'cause I'm killin' this shit
Yeah, I'm killin' this shit
Oh yeah, oh yeah, I'm killin' this shit
Bobby, how many times you been killin' this shit?
Find another rhyme, goddamn, nigga, shit

[Chorus: Logic]
Fuck rap
Bustin' like an addict with a semi-automatic
Who done had it, and he ready for anybody to buck back
Hold up, catch a vibe, ain't no way in hell we leavin' nobody alive
Leave a suicide note, fuck that
Bobby feelin' villainous, he killin' this
I'm comin' for your man and his lady and even the baby
I'm feelin' like I'm, chika-chika-chika-chika
Chika-chika-chika-chika-chika, Slim Shady

[Verse 2: Logic]
There's nowhere to hide, we call this shit genocide
Hit 'em with that (Do-do-do) and they die
We gon' leave 'em crucified, we call this shit genocide
I got bitches, I got hoes, I got rare designer clothes
No, we ain't fuckin' with that
Yeah, there's a time and a place
But if you ain't comin' with the illest of raps
Callin' yourself the greatest alive
Then you don't deserve to do that
No, no, oh no, no, please do not do that
You gon' get smacked
You gon' make Bobby attack
You gon' make Bobby Boy snap
You gon' make Bobby Boy snap (Bobby Boy!)

[Chorus: Logic]
Fuck rap
Bustin' like an addict with a semi-automatic
Who done had it, and he ready for anybody to buck back
Hold up, catch a vibe, ain't no way in hell we leavin' nobody alive
Leave a suicide note, fuck that
Bobby feelin' villainous, he killin' this
I'm comin' for your man and his lady and even the baby
I'm feelin' like I'm chika-chika-chika-chika
Chika-chika-chika-chika-chika, Slim Shady

[Verse 3: Eminem]
Jigga-jigga-jigga-jigga-jigga like JAY-Z
Jig is up, you fuckers who didn't write anything
Are getting washed, liga-liga-liga, like bathing
Young Hova, I know hitters like Yankees
Gun toters that pull triggers like crazy
Unloadin', leave you shot up in your Rover
Your body goes limp and slumps over
Like A-Rod in a month lull, but he just homered
Hol' up, I said "Rover" because now your Rover is red
Like Red Rover, so you know what I meant
But I roll over my opponents instead
Makin' dog sounds 'cause I gotta keep breakin' these bars down
I'll go slow for the speds
But when I go (Roof!) like the Dobermann said
I still think the (Roof!) would go over your head (Ha-ha)
Beast mode, motherfuckers 'bout to get hit
With so many foul lines, you'll think I'm a free throw
Figured it was about time for people to eat crow
You about to get out-rhymed, how could I be dethroned?
I stay on my toes like the repo, a behemoth in sheep's clothes
From the East Coast to the West, I'm the ethos and I'm the G.O.A.T
Who the best, I don't gotta say a fuckin' thing, though
'Cause MCs know
But you don't wanna hear me spit the facts
Your shit is ass like a tailbone
Or you're trapped in your cell phone
Or my chicken scratch, or my self-loathe
I don't wanna fuckin' listen to you spit your raps someone else wrote
Used to get beat up by the big kids
Used to let the big kids steal my big wheel
And I wouldn't do shit but just sit still
Now money's not a big deal
I'm rich, I wipe my ass with six mill'
Big bills like a platypus
A caterpillar's comin' to get the cannabis
I'm lookin' for the smoke but you motherfuckers are scatterin'
Batterin' everything and I've had it with the inadequate
Man, I can see my dick is standin' stiff as a mannequin
And I'm bringin' the bandana back, and the fuckin' headband again
A handkerchief and I'm thinkin' of bringin' the fuckin' fingerless gloves back
And not giving a singular fuck, like fuck rap
I sound like a fuckin' millionaire
With a Derringer with a hair trigger
'Bout to bear hug a fuckin' terrier, the Ric Flair dripper
Y'all couldn't hold a candle at a prayer vigil
When I vent, they compare me to a fuckin' air duct
I'm 'bout to bare-knuckle it, nah, fuck it
I'm gonna go upside their head with a Nantucket
Abraca-fuckin'-dabra
The track is the blood, I'm attracted, I'm attackin' it
What? Dracula, fuck that shit
I'm up, back with a thud
Man, stop

[Outro: Chris D'Elia]
Look what I'm plannin', plannin', I'm plannin' to
Do all this while ya panickin'
And you're lookin' and starin' at mannequins
And I'm goin' to Fanagans
Trying to get up a plan against
All of the blana-kazana-ka-fam-bam-bannigans
While of all the bana-kazanika Hanna in a cabana
You're in a cab-
I'm in a cabana and a Janet
I'm in a cabana chantin' all this standup banter
While you don't got the stamina, you're lackin' the stamina
You're lackin' the stamina while you're divorcin' Harrison Ford
And I'm in a Porsche on the floorboards
While I'm world tourin'
You usin' way too many napkins, papkins
Lapkins and chapki-
You using ChapStick and napkins while I'm bapkin'
Flappin' around like a bapkin'
Flamminababbitapannitajampkin
Dammit, a can of pada-[Intro]
Yeah, uh, yeah

[Verse 1]
Livin' life like this
Gotta paint a picture when I write like this
Tales from my hood, not a sight like this
Where they up to no good on a night like this
And they murder motherfuckers just 'cause
Type of shit I see, you probably wonder where I was
I was in the crib, just sittin' on the rug
Basedheads comin' through lookin' for the plug
Now, born and raised in my area
Beautiful by day, by night it's hysteria
Fuck around and bury ya tonight
Ridin' with my homies on sight
Momma tell me to come in at night
Now I really gotta go, but they never know
Livin' life to the fullest, I gotta blow
Po-po finna bust in the door, we got blow in the crib
In the kitchen over there next to the baby with the bib
Goddamn, what it feel like, middle of the night
Wakin' up, scared for my life
Never had the heat, just a knife
When the gat go blat like that
Guarantee you its a wrap
Finna put you on your back like that
Just breathe, while their mama grieve
Bullet to the dome like an Aleve
Gotta leave for the premises, to murder my nemesis
No, no, uh, uh, just stop, stop, stop
Fore they even call the cops
Do it for the money and the bitches
And the drugs and the props
Tell me why another body even gotta drop
Get shot off top for some shit that was gang related

[Break: News Report Sample]
Up first at five tonight, breaking news in Gaithersburg, where a massive manhunt is underway after a deadly shooting. It's all unfolding in the 400 block of West Deer Park and 355. Our Montgomery County reporter joins us, with the latest tonight

[Verse 2]
Livin' life like this
Hope little Bobby never fight like this
Stab a motherfucker with a knife like this
All about the money on a night like this
Run up in the crib, put a bullet in your rib
Got a lot to give, but I never had the chance
Never had the chance, yeah
Stay strapped, but I hate it when I take it out
If you want it I'ma lay it out
Hope my little brother make it out
Every night what I pray about what I pray about
Check it, uh yeah, got a son on the way
But I cling to the streets even though I wanna run away
I imagine a better life
Where I never had a debt in life
Hit you with the *gunshots* in the dead of night
Sellin' crack to my own pops
Pushin' this weight on my own block
If I sell a brick I can buy a house
If they find the key they might lock me up
But I take the chance 'cause I need that shit and dont give a fuck
Take the chance, 'cause I need that shit and dont give a fuck
[Pause]  Get down or lay down
Hit ya with the Beretta, you better stay down
Stray shots on the playground
Livin' how I'm livin' with the life that I'm given
Anybody thats ridin' with me, Im ridin' with 'em
Show me the enemy, and I'ma hit 'em
The second I bit 'em, I get 'em
And hit 'em with the venom
Aint no need to pretend I'ma never do it
I knew it, already been through it
I do it for the street, for the fam, for the life
Anybody that's gang related[Verse]
Ayy, bitch, I've been goin' and goin' like the Energizer
Yeah, I'm supplyin' the wood like Elijah
In the cut, smokin' on indica
Might fuck around and compartmentalize ya
They say, they say life is a bitch
And if that is the case then I'm finna surprise her
No, I am not an advisor, but I do advise ya
To pay attention, never need to mention
I'm that motherfucker bustin' heads
Finna push it to the ledge
Yeah, I been smokin' my meds
Ain't got no love for the feds
Can't let fame go to yo' head
Fuck with me, watch where you tread
I'm finna kill it instead
I'm finna, I'm finna, I'm finna
I will, I will, do it like I never done it
And I wanna run it and I wanna keep it goin' and goin'
Like infinity, be the only entity to ever rip it apart
From the start like this, from the heart like this
Finna murder it, a million miles a minute, no nitrous
Doin' righteous
I-I been, I-I-I been down this road before
Everybody think that they do but they don't
Swear to God that they would but they won't
Spittin' riddles in the middle of a past-time
Me in my mind, feelin' divine, like yeah
Finna get it like yeahyeah
Like yeah, like yeah (Woo, woo, woo, woo)
I done made 20 million dollars (Preach)
I don't flex to be acknowledged (Preach)
At this point it's common knowledge (Preach)
All you haters been abolished (Preach)
You in the club throwin' dollars, but I'm savin' mine so my kids go to college (Preach)
Or maybe whatever they wanna do (Preach)
Just as long as they never say (Preach)
"Daddy blew 20 million dollars (Ayy)
He had to flex to be acknowledged (Ayy)
He in the club throwin' dollars
And now cannot afford to send me to college (Ayy)
Daddy just wanna be loved
Just like everybody wanna be accepted (Ayy)
But somehow he had neglected
Me and my momma for all of this rap shit" (Ayy)
No, I cannot fuck with that shit (Ayy)
No, I cannot fuck with that
Who you know dropped an album
Back to back to back to back to back to back again?
I'm back again to snap again
And goddamnit, it ain't no other way around it
Yeah, it's happenin', 'cause I've been livin' in a world on my own
Leave me alone, I'm in the zone
Where I've been prone to destroy shit
You cannot avoid this, whack mothafuckas have annoyed this
Yes, you know I enjoy this
Preach, mothafuckin' preach
Yeah, I'm tryna reach everybody in the streets
Writin' words to the beats
Each one teach one, yeah, I'm tryna reach one
Who the beast one?
That be me, on the top to the East one
Tell me how you really wanna do it right now, time to murder this
Shout out everybody, no fuckin' around, ain't heard of this
Heard of us, we ain't goin' nowhere, it's a herd of us
Hold up, roll up
Levitated like I'm David Blaine
Livin' a dream like I'm David Aames
Talk all you want, we are not the same
Step in the spot, now they know the name
Sold more albums my first week than Harry Styles and Katy Perry
If that ain't a sign of the times
Then I don't know what is, man this shit is scary
'Cause bitch, I've been blowin' up like C-4
And I'm 3 for 3 like a free throw
Anybody hatin' on the boy, take a step back and then deep-throat
Now my phone blowin' up like ring
Like ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring!
That Kevin Durant, I'm a champion
Check the numbers, I'm a champion
Can't sleep on the boy anymore
But the haters that love to hate gon' pop an Ambien
Star Lord, champion
Know the name, now they know the alias, that's for sure
Gave 'em 44, now here's 44 more[Intro]
Okay I was gone for a minute but I'm back now
Sit the fuck back down
Seem like everybody nowadays Hollywood
Oh, its like that now?
I'ma show you mothafuckas how to act now
I'ma show 'em how to act
I'ma show 'em how to act

[Verse 1]
Okay now picture little Bobby just a youngin' runnin' round
With his mans, hammer in his hands, feelin' like the man
Run, mothafucka, run
Before the popo get the gun, put it to your brain like goddamn!
Everybody know you ain't about it
Everything you talk about I know I can live without it
Red light, stop. Green light, go!
Everything ain't what it seem like
Mothafucka I know!
Hold up, what you mean, where you been?
Bitch, I been in
This is merely the beginning again
What you been living in?
A box, under the bridge, like Anthony Kiedis?
Looking for something to complete us
And maybe lead us, fuck an elitist
Hell of a long way from equal is how they treat us
Body of a builder with the mind of a fetus
Turn on the television and see the vision they feed us
And I wish I could erase that, face facts

[Chorus]
Everybody people, everybody bleed, everybody need something
Everybody love, everybody know, how it go
Everybody people, everybody bleed, everybody need something
Everybody love, everybody know

[Verse 2]
I been knockin' doors down like a Jehovah witness
God as my witness, I'm with this
But on the real, I think I need another witness!
If it was 1717, black daddy, white momma wouldn't change a thing
Light skin mothafucka certified as a house nigga
Well I'll be God damned, go figure
In my blood is the slave and the master
It's like the devil playin' spades with the pastor
But he was born with the white privilege!
Man, what the fuck is that?
White people told me as a child, as a little boy, playin' with his toys
I should be ashamed to be black
And some black people look ashamed when I rap
Like my great granddaddy didnt take a whip to the back
Not accepted by the black or the white
I don't give a fuck, praise God, I could see the light
Everybody talkin' 'bout race this, race that
I wish I could erase that, face facts

[Chorus]
Everybody people, everybody bleed, everybody need something
Everybody love, everybody know, how it go
Everybody people, everybody bleed, everybody need something
Everybody love, everybody know

[Outro]
Okay I was gone for a minute but I'm back now
Sit the fuck back down
Seem like everybody nowadays Hollywood
Oh, it's like that now?
I'ma show you mothafuckas how to act now
I'ma show 'em how to act
I'ma show 'em how to act[Produced by Logic]

[Chorus]
Work so fucking much, my greatest fear is I'ma die alone
Every diamond in my chain, yeah, that's a milestone (I'm lovin' it!)
People calling me, askin' me for money, man (Uh)
The only thing I'ma give you motherfuckers is the dial tone (Yeah)

[Verse 1]
Flashbacks of a youngin' sippin' that purple Kool-Aid
Skippin' school with my homies and chiefing reefer for two days
Running from the law, livin' how I'm livin', fuck 'em all
Bumping Triple Six
Hennessy in my cup, drivin' through the sticks
Who the bitch ridin' with me?
Man, the devil tryna get me
Motivated, under-educated, and hated
But finally gettin' cake like a happy belated
Bitch I made it, we on
Buy it, break it, roll it, light it, smoke it, inhale it
Write it, record it, mix it, master it, press it up, unveil it
Feel like I've been waitin' forever, forever to inherit
This is war, I declare it
Time is money, I can't spare it
Futuristic, so simplistic
Please decipher my linguistics
Slow it down, Robitussin
I'm the king, ain't no discussion
And now we blowin' up like spontaneous human combustion
My consumption is the illest
Section eight, I know you feel this
On the come up,  where they run up on you for nothin' at all
Brighter than eleven suns, this the first, where my funds?
EBT, that's the card
I thank God, I thank God, but it's hard
Uh, but it's hard

[Chorus]
Uh, work so fuckin' much, my greatest fear is I'ma die alone
Every diamond in my chain, yeah, that's a milestone
People callin' me, askin' me for money, man
The only thing I'ma give you motherfuckers is the dial tone

[Verse 2]
God damn, god damn, we at it again
Me and my homies that know me blowing up like the Taliban
Yeah, my stress up, but I'm blessed up
Fuck around and get messed up
When I murder the rhyme, I'm livin' divine
You know that I'm one of a kind
Lemme get it right now, ho
Draped up and I'm dripped out (And I'm dripped out)
Right now, ho
Caked up 'til I cash out and I got 'em all wonderin', "How so?"
On the down low, haters drown slow
On the down low, haters drown slow
Oh God, my God, we got it all right
Oh God, my God, we gotta get it, right?
These fuckers facades, they just a mirage, right?
I said these fuckers facades, they just a mirage, right?
Uh, tell me that they love me
Know damn well that they don't give a fuck
I be on that finger-flippin' killin' shit up in the cut
That's what's up
All these bitches out here tryna gas it up
This is everything I ever wanted, I can't pass it up
Life changed in a year, couldn't happen fast enough
"Can I do it like you do it?" That's what they be askin' us
White Benz, black card, bitch better get your plastic up
Man, this shit is hella hard, but we never actin' up
Live it up, hold on to your dream, don't ever give it up
Finally had my share of success, and shit, I can't get enough
Now they know my name through the nation
'Cause my single like that good shit, man, always in rotation
Now they know Logic for Logic, not through my affiliations
Stackin' profit on profit, from this music I'm makin'
Even Jesus had haters, so when you feelin' forsaken
Tell 'em jealous Judases who this is, and man, that'll break 'em
And bitch, I'm still the same
Dash of autotune so y'all can feel the pain
Broke as fuck, back in that basement, not a dollar to my name
Chasin' fame, chasin' glory, 'til the day we make a story
Positive that life ain't mine, bitch you can take that shit to Maury

[Chorus]
Work so fuckin' much, my greatest fear is I'ma die alone
Every diamond in my chain, yeah, that's a milestone
People callin' me, askin' me for money, man
The only thing I'ma give you motherfuckers is the dial tone

[Verse 3]
(Hello, no one is available to take your call)
I been workin' hard, I been searchin' for God
I been workin' hard, I been searchin' for God
(Please leave a message after the tone)
Little brother, this is yo' sister, you're busy, I get you
But I insist you call me back 'cause I miss you
I wish you well, well, I wish you would call
'Cause lately it feel like Im just not yo' sister at allall
Uh, Im sorry for callin' and bawlin', Im all in
And I feel like I'm fallin' lately, it feel like my children hate me
You tell me I'm beautiful and yet no man wanna date me
Haunted by vivid memories of that man who raped me
And lately I, I feel more and more like mommy, I know Im me, but still
You always seemed to pick up the phone and somehow I feel
Better, but you been answerin' me lesser and lesser
So I resorted to the pills in my dresser, I'm gone
And as for... oh no, he left and he aint comin' back
I hate him and if I see him I swear I tell him that
No longer cookin' crack in my kitchen, cuttin' an' sellin' that
He broke my heart, that relationship been to hell and back
I been workin' hard, I been searchin' for God
I can feel the Devil around me as they all applaud
Promise you won't forget me, that you'll always be wit' me
And even when you gone I can call whenever he hit me
Under pressure, I've been feeling under pressure

[Verse 4]
Hey, son, this is your father, don't mean to bother
How are you? Heard you were in town, but I never saw ya
Tried to call ya, where are ya?
In Paris? What a beautiful destination
To perish right by the Eiffel, come now
Please don't be spiteful of all my small talk
I think we're overdue a long talk
When I see kids around the way, I say how I'm your dad
It gets me thinkin' 'bout incredible moments we've had
And on the real, I'm tryin' so hard not to bug you
But do you think you could stop rappin' about my drug use?
I'm two years clean, no longer a fiend
Yeah, I'm 57, but I feel 19
And I love you I swear, Bobby, I know you're there
And when the time is right I know that you gon' take care
Of anything I need, of yo' family
Can I have some tickets to your next show?
Would you stand wit' me?
Can I have some money for my new honey that's hella fine?
I forgot to mention I got divorced from yo' step-mom
My mind goin' crazy, but I still look hella calm
Maybe you could tell *beep*
I've been feelin' under pressure

[Interlude]
Hey, what's up, bro? This Ralph, I didn't want much, man, just calling to see what's going on. I know you're busy. Uh, Dad hit me up, it's his birthday today, but I know you know that. Uh, yeah, he calling, he be tryna introduce me to his new chick and stuff, man, I don't know how to handle that. I don't wanna tell him like nah, I ain't trying to meet her off top, you know? So what you think I should do? Text me, I know you're busy, dawg. But he been callin' me saying he wanna come down, he wanna bring his new chick and Brenda's like "Damn, he really tryna rock out with his new chick" 'cause you know we all fuck with Debbie. But I don't know, I don't know how to tell him this shit so just hit me back whenever you got the time, man, I know there's more shit on your plate. You ain'tyou ain't gotta hit me, dawg, but if you do I'd appreciate it. When you back, love you, do your thing. Swag RattPack all day, boy. Alright, nigga, hit me

[Verse 5]
Uh, yeah, dear family, I'm so sorry that I've been distant
Everything changed in an instant, my time has been inconsistent
I know that you been insistin', I know that birthday I missed it
I swore I told my assistant, but I guess my mind is in another place
Thoughts off in another world, I started seein' another girl
It fell through, man, what a world
But I'm so focused on my craft, on employin' my staff
Such a perfectionist, I can't even finish this draft
This letter to the ones I love, the ones that I miss
Brothers and sisters that hit me up just to reminisce
Meanwhile, people outside of my blood askin' for favors
I don't owe you a fuckin' thing, you best switch yo' behavior
Truly remarkable how I barely know you, but somehow owe you When you don't even know 'bout the shit I go through, uh
We ain't spoken in a while, tell me sister, how yo' child?
Come now, girl, give me a smile, come on, girl, don't do me foul
Sorry I ain't call before, but I'm callin' you right now
I heard that you was poppin' E, stop resortin' to the vowel
How my mama, how she doin'? Does she know what I'm pursuin'?
I ain't talk to her in years, that relationship she ruined
But sometimes I wake up and wonder just what the fuck I'm doin'
They say family is everything, I swear that shit the truth
I should spend it all with y'all, but I spend it in the booth
This is everything I love, this is everything I need
Never sacrifice this feelin' even though my heart it bleed
This is everything I love, everything I need
Never sacrifice this feelin' even though my heart bleed
Under pressure, I've been feelin' under pressure

[Interlude]
Hey, son, I'm sorry I missed your call today, but I was in an AA meeting. Um, a friend of mine was celebrating four years so I couldn't get you right then. And then when I did call you, you weren't able to answer or whatever. Just wonderin' how things are going. Deb and I aren't together anymore, um... Livin' on my own, you know, um... Anyway, the whole family, even the family that you dont know, my sisters and your aunts that you've never met are very proud of you. Your cousins just love you too. Anyway, son, I love you, I just want you to know that. And just keep grindin', you know? And um, I don't wanna hear you joinin' the Illuminati 'cause then I gotta kill ya. Hm-hm, I love you, son, bye[Verse]
I can feel you in my lungs, feel you in my veins
Bloodstream only way to make it to my brain
I tried some others but man they just not as good as you
Going crazy 'cause I only feel this good with you
Maybe I'm just not as strong as I once was
When we're together lately I don't even feel a buzz
I'm addicted to this shit like it was hard drugs (Drugs)
Nikki baby, I love you but now I gotta go
'Cause in the end what happens you already know
Probably wonder where I been at, I been laying low
But in my mind I'm wondering what I'm paying for (Paying for)
All these other bitches on my dick but I can't fuck with that
You're the only girl I need I gotta have you back
Even though you turn my lungs black (My lungs black)
Tell me where you been Jack (Been Jack)
Uh, I know this shorty that go by the name of Mary
I used to fuck her way back when I didn't know a thing
Skipping school with all my homies on some truancy
But when I ended things with her it was just you and me
Doing me good, that's what I thought at first
Me and you together, swear to God that's all that worked
Away from you though man it's just so hard to work (Hard to work)
Uh, my heart is hard at work
We been together like ten years
Goddamn, took me as young man
Everyday I wonder who I am, who will I be, where will I go
What will they write upon my grave?
A free man born as a king, who died as a slave
But everything he gave her was for nothing though
Oh no I can't fade that shit I gotta let you go
You got me tripping like a flight to Vegas
All this shit you got me doing man it's outrageous
All I know is I'm living the life I never would
Finally let you go, I thought I never could
Don't get me wrong, can't forget the times shared
Seem like everywhere I go, I always know you're there
Tried to run but my legs won't
I look away but my head don't
I love it when you're fresh
I love it when I take your top off and we share the same breath
I hate it that I need you, Nikki
But I love it when I feed you, Nikki
I hate that I bleed for you
Uh, I long and I need for you
But I love it when I taste you (Taste you)
Nothing can replace you (Replace you)
I wish I could erase you, youre everywhere I go
But you're everywhere I long to be
And all these other people that don't seem to understand
I'm just a man they always ask whats wrong with me
Man you're everything I crave
You're the only thing I let in that would put me in the grave
I'm a king, you're my Coretta
But lately, I been feeling like a slave for the nicotine (Nicotine, nicotine)

[Break]
Slave for the
Said, I'm a slave for the nicotine (Nicotine, nicotine)
Been a slave for ya
I'm a muthafuckin' slave for ya
Slave for the nicotine (Nicotine, nicotine)
Nikki, Nikki, slave for ya
I'm a slave for ya Nikki
I'm a muthafuckin' slave for ya

[Outro: Thalia]

Jesus, Black Jesus

[Chorus]
I been feeling so down
I think they should know now
I think they should know what's up
That's that road I been down
I know how it go down
I know how it go now, what's up
I feel like I dont belong
I feel like my life is wrong
I feel like I dont know what's up
What's up, what's up
Yeah, yeah
Ayy

[Verse]
I aint here to pick and choose
I ain't here to sing the blues
Im just here to spread the clues
Im just here to spread the news
Everybody know I do
Listen
I aint ashamed to be white
I aint ashamed to be Black
I aint ashamed of my beautiful Mexican wife as a matter of fact
I know you fucking with that
And Im not scared of the people who tell me I should be
Do what you love and dont ever wonder what it could be
Everybody from my hood, everybody know Im good
Sometimes Im misunderstood
But that's just the uneducated that never related and feel like I'm fading off
They feel like I'm fading
I'm right out my mind
Tell 'em!
Momma don't love me
Daddy don't love me
Wonder why I drown in the bubbly
You could be anything you wanna be
'Cept the person you dont wanna be
Let him hate let em love
Wondering if everybody still like this up above
When that push come to shove
Make me wanna pull up with the, with the gat in the glove like
I just wanna be free
Not a slave to the stereotype
All alone in my room in the middle of the night
I dont have the words but my stereo might
I don't wanna be black, I dont wanna be white, I just wanna be a man today
I don't wanna be a Christian, Muslim, gay, straight, or bi, see you later, bye
Not perceived by the things I believe or the color of my skin
Or the fact Im attracted to her, maybe him
Or the fact Im a single mother living all alone
Looking for a man and a home to call my own
But I already have one
The only man Ima ever need is my son, my son, my son, my son
Son, say:
Black is beautiful
Be black and proud
Fuck everybody hatin' on me right now, Im black and proud
Im just as white as that Mona Lisa
Im just as black as my cousin Keisha
Im biracial so bye Felicia
Praise Black Jesus now call the preacher
Maybe Jesus was black
Maybe Jesus had dreads
Spiderman should be black
I vote for Glover instead
Glover instead
Like what's up
I vote for more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more
I vote for so much more

[Chorus]
I been feeling so down
I think they should know now
I think they should know what's up
That's that road I been down
I know how it go down
I know how it go now, what's up
I feel like I dont belong
I feel like my life is wrong
I feel like I dont know what's up
What's up, what's up

[Bridge: Logic & Damian]
Go on and let your soul glow
Let your soul glow

Hold up
Let me get my mind, let me get my mind right, yeah
Let me get my mind, let me get my mind right
You know everything is alright
You know everything is al-

[Verse 1: Logic]
Just ride with a mothafucka
Keep it real, never lie to a mothafucka, hold me down
Chillin', In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida, rockin' Adidas
With a seorita when she sippin' liquor by the liter
That's royalty, like the homie Gambino
He know we be in the casino, lightin' Cubans with a C-note
I'ma fuck the game, dare you to test my libido
Comin' up shorter than Danny DeVito
Whenever I step on the beat, ho
Like a killer on the creep slow
Had my share of defeat, but we still gon' eat, ho
While the fans bumpin' Welcome To Forever on repeat though, uh
Wonderin' if I'ma ever fall off
Feelin' mad at the world, wanna hit it with a sawed-off
Blowin' up like a Molotov
This is war, everybody, ain't no reason I'ma call it off
Get it right, shout out to the homie Dizzy Wright
In the studio every day
So you know this shit about to be a busy night
Everything is al-, everything is alright

[Interlude: Big Sean]
It's Finally Famous over everything
RattPack gang
What up though, Logic? Yeah
Day one shit right there

[Chorus: Logic & Big Sean]
Hold up
Let me get my mind, let me get my mind right, yeah
Let me get my mind, let me get my mind right
You know everything is alright (Sean Don)
You know everything is al-

[Verse 2: Big Sean]
Oh my God, they plottin' and schemin'
Fuckboys rather me not even breathin'
They tryna take my blessings away
They gotta be demons, I'm blessed every day
And not blessed like I'm sneezin', I'm healthy and well
On top of my ship and I'm not even sinkin'
And I could just sit back and say that I'm happy
But can't spend a day without smokin' and drinkin'
Got Champagne problems, and I order more
My wardrobe is Aura Gold
I'm a young nigga with a older soul
But still young enough to know I gotta know some more
I made somethin' out of nothin', Sean Don the magician (Good, yeah)
She doin' tricks with her pussy, I guess she's a vagician (Good)
She tryna hold on to a nigga sta-sta-stackin' up (Uh-huh)
Purell for these fake niggas tryna dap-dap me up
Hype nigga, back-back-back it up (Whoa)
Claimin' that we homies, boy stop (Stop)
That's the type of shit I boycott
Yellin' fuck the 5-0, state troops
Any nigga with a badge, I don't even trust the boy scouts
I got these good girls hoin' out
Tell me what the fuck you know about (What?)
Bein' that nigga that these niggas don't know about
Then they throw you in the game
And you mothafuckin' blow it out
Now everything is alright

[Chorus: Logic]
Hold up
Let me get my mind, let me get my mind right, yeah
Let me get my mind, let me get my mind right
You know everything is alright (Yeah)
You know everything is al- (Uh, yeah)

[Verse 3: Logic]
Whippin' through Gotham
Hatin' mothafuckas, I wanna off 'em
Hella endorphins, got me livin' life to the coffin
I'm coughin', wonderin' if I'm goin' insane
Nobody knowin' my pain
But I be killin' 'cause I'm into the game
Now lookin' back, it's like ain't nothin' the same
All these Spanish women watchin' me like a novella
Hit you with a Beretta, get you wetter than a umbrella
Ain't nobody better do it like me
I know a lot of mothafuckas don't like me, prolly wanna fight me
But I just keep the peace, no need to keep a piece
I keep my enemies on a leash, capiche?
And keep it real for the people I reach[Produced by Logic]

[Ad-Libs]
Uh a-ah, yeah, uh, uh, yeah yeah

[Intro]
All day (All day), everyday (Everyday)
We was on that block until we made a way (We made a way)
Day to day, man that's the only way (Only way)
They gon' know my name until it fade away

[Chorus]
Fade away, fade away, fade away, fade away, fade away
They gon' know my name until it fade
(Way, way, way), uh, fade away
Uh, they gon' know my name until it fade away
(Okay, okay)

[Verse 1]
I been there, I done that, done that, this rap shit I run that
Motherfucker this far from a comeback, if one of us fall then we run back
Can't let that social worker just snatch up my kin, gotta get my son back
Cause when they coming through that system don't give a fuck about you (You, you, you)
Everybody gonna die, gonna go one day, maybe it'll happen on a Monday
Driving to work and get hit by a Hyundai, fuck it, let it all go one day
I know, I'ma get it like this, living that life while they all reminisce
Never regretted, the second I said it I feel like I'm smarter, I read it on Reddit
You're fucking pathetic, my etiquette murder ya predicate, bitch I'm ahead of it, yeah
Yes I'ma die but I dont wonder why in the hell I'ma ride in the dead of it, yeah
I know, know, life on Earth is so unpredictable
Okay-kay, hold up let me say yes I fade away

[Chorus]
Fade away, fade away, fade away, fade away, fade away
They gon' know my name until it fade a uh
(Way, way, way), fade away
They gon' know my name until it fade away
(Yeah, yeah)

[Verse 2]
Tell me what I wouldn't wanna give for a life like this, arm and a leg quite like this
Fuck around wanna fight like this, take a hike like this
I might just, might just, I don't know
Reinvention, that's my intention
Want so much more than this third-dimension
That's not to mention my true ascension is a bigger picture
No metaphor, Im being real with ya
But it will hit ya like, "goddamn!"
Going HAM, full of all of them
In a spaceship, Im in another system
So futuristic, on another mission
But back on Earth everybody bitchin', I been in the kitchen
Livin' my lifeno inhibition, life to death with no intermission
Now the good book said we all the same, and we kill each other but it's all in vain
And we all to blame, can't see the picture when it's out the frame
Real talk, I wanna grip the grain and just ride with ya, build a family then die richer
When ya get to heaven I'ma come and get ya
Sit back and really get the picture
This life, yeah, it done ate away, hard times never stayed away
But one thing I know day to day, I'ma do somethin' 'fore I fade away

[Chorus (Extended)]
Fade away, fade away, fade away, fade away, fade away
They gon' know my name until it fade
(Way, way, way), fade away
They gon' know my name until it fade away
Fade away, fade away, fade away, fade away, fade away
They gon' know my name until it fade
(Way, way, way), fade away
They gon' know my name until it fade away

THOMAS: Get the upgrade?
KAI: Nah, man. Its the same shit with a different title!
THALIA: Thats not true, Kai
KAI: What the fuck?!
THOMAS: Yeah, man. They didnt just upgrade features, they enhanced her A.I
KAI: So she can actually hold a conversation?
THOMAS: Yeah. Ask her yourself
KAI: Uh, what am I thinking, Thalia?
THALIA: Kai, Im a program in the ships interface, not a psychic
KAI: Damn, girl!
THOMAS: Yeah, thats another thing now. Shes unisex
KAI: What?!
THOMAS: Thalia, integrate Y chromosome feature
THALIA: Sure thing, Thomas. Would you like a standard accent or something a little more exotic?
KAI: Holy shit!
THOMAS: Told you, man. The upgrades crazy. Thalia, revert last command and run simulation
THALIA: Running simulation
KAI: Man, what the hell is that?

KAI: Anybody?

THALIA: What up Kai, you lil' bitch?

If you're dealing war, backwards stay far
We're dealing with truths and rights
Come some more into my sight
(You no hear me yet?)
(Hear me live and direct)
(Walk with your tap)

[Verse]
Yeah, in London talkin' to rhtork 'bout my life and shit
I thought the album was finished but I keep writing shit
It's kind of funny how life changed and rearranged
No matter what happens, everything ain't gon' be the same
The incredible album, what an incredible outcome
I grip the mic and then talk to the people like I'm Malcolm
I used to think the fame and money was the motivation
Until I toured the world and met the people face to face and
Understood that the power was harnessed in that basement
It ain't about the money and notoriety
It's about the people and making a difference in society
But don't get it twisted, this life I'm living is like a movie
The Godfather, the Goodfella wielding a Uzi
One with the people, if the people is wondering who's he?
Same level, the same rebel that never settled
Pullin' strings like Geppetto who overcame the ghetto
And I know you wrote me and I still ain't answered
'Cause shit is different now, it's forced upon me, different stances
I used to spend all my time conversing with you
But now I write this song to let you know I'm hurting with you
Shit is too big, but let's be honest man, it's kinda bittersweet
Besides the shows and meet and greets, y'all only see me on the street
And even then, that shit is rareI just don't go outside
'Cause honestly I don't fuck with this world, I'd rather hide
That misconception, "'Cause I rap, I must be filled with pride"
Shit I ain't perfect, if you heard different then someone lied
People in my ear telling me, "Talk that shit"
Actions speak louder than words, I'd rather walk that shit
Since the first album, I'm one of the highest earners on the label
Within six months I put the second one on they table
I played sold out shows in parts of the world I can't pronounce
Release the tickets, watch them disappear when we announce
Fuck all that murderous syllable shit right now, just let me bounce
The mood around me is people smokin' it by the ounce
Leave Friday for the show and come back Monday with a hundred grand
Don't fuck with checks, so when I bounce I prefer cash in hand
You know my first week looking crazy due to high demand
'Cause people don't buy music in this day and age, they buy the brand
There's ups and downs, don't get me wrong but back when I ain't have shit
Felt like I woulda sold my soul to make it with this rap shit
Thank God, he never let Lucifer close enough to ask
Let me attain it by workin' hard and busting my ass
Achieved a lot in life, but what's a lot with more to gain?
At least I don't drink to avoid the hurt, we call that champagne

[Outro]
Come some more into my sight...[Intro]
Alright
Seen a lot of shit, yeah
Seen a lot of shit

[Verse 1]
I've seen a lot of shit I shouldn't have but never forgot it though
Brothers on the corner selling crack like it was nada though
Walk inside my kitchen baking soda all up on the floor
Police banging on the door while gripping a .44
I was just a youngin' but this type of shit I've seen before
Y'all see a white boy, but my daddy a negro
Half breed motherfucker grip the mic and he flow
I just wanna spread love, they want me to bleed slow
I just wanna keep the peace and help people
Give some of this money that I'm making to the people
So if you hatin' on me goddamn, you evil
And just don't understand 'cause I'm flyer than Knievel
Been through a lot of shit but I keep it on the D-Lo
Never bustin' in 'em streets but I keep it G though
I ain't into fairy tales, I'm just me, ho!
Only thing I talk about is everything that we know
I heard you got a fucking problem, bitch, I bet I beast
Ain't no need to reach, I don't need a piece
I just kill 'em with kindness, yeah, we leave em deceased
And tell it like it is so now you got it, capiche? Homie, what up?

[Chorus]
Let me bring it back down
They think it's a game right now (Yeah)
But it ain't the same right now, know my name right now (Yeah)
Back where I came from now
We gon' live it up 'til we bring it back down
They think it's a game right now
But it ain't the same right now, know my name right now
Back where I came from now
We gon' live it up 'til we bring it back down

[Verse 2]
I hope you live a long life hatin'
Now watch every Grammy just to see who they nominating, uh
So successful they probably say I signed with Satan
But I got God on my side, always down to ride
Don't get it twisted, I ain't perfect in the least
I'm still all up in your girl jeans like a crease
Matter fact like a geneticist
These rappers' records comin' out, they so repetitive
Shout out my homie Chance, peace to Skizzy Mars
RattPack, homie Castro, we dropping bars
It's all love, man that shit is ours
They never thought I'd make it, shooting for the stars
Yeah, I'm a born sinner, but it's a Cole world
Shout out my homies that know me, can't forget my old girl
But that's a touchy subject like a priest, whoa
I heard y'all finally eating over there, we got a feast, though
Keep it RattPack 'til the beat go
You might not get the flow now, let it seep though
Fans know my lyrics deeper than the sea floor
But we dumb it down so they spin it on the radio
Racism all up in 'em, that shit is irrelevant
My flow is colorblind, rapping for the hell of it
I don't give a fuck, my mind-state celibate
Run quick, tell a bitch, rap getting me hella rich
Out the blue like Ella Fitz, my flow is so elegant
Death before dishonor, murderin' rappers in front of they mama's
I rep Artanis, decipher the word 'cause it's ebonics
Reverse the letters and it spells Sinatra, yes, I gotcha, bitch it's Logic

[Chorus]
Let me bring it back down
They think it's a game right now (Yeah)
But it ain't the same right now, know my name right now (Yeah)
Back where I came from now
We gon' live it up 'til we bring it back down
They think it's a game right now
But it ain't the same right now, know my name right now
Back where I came from now
We gon' live it up 'til we bring it back down

[Ad-Lib: Woman]
Mmmn, I'm thinking...
Okay[Chorus: Logic]
Yeah
I'm like, "Oh, God, oh- oh, my God"
Bitch, I run the game, y'all just commentate from the side
I'm like, "Oh, God, oh- oh, my God"
Everything I do, you know I do it for the squad
I'm like, "Oh, God, oh- oh, my God"
Bitch, I run the game, y'all just commentate from the side
I'm like, "Oh, God, oh- oh, my God"
Everything I do, you know I do it for the squad
I'm like...

[Verse 1: Logic]
This-this-this-this-this the type of shit they said they really wanted
So I gave them this right here, now go get blunted
Check my last album, all y'all know I run it
Flipped the script just 'cause I could and fucking stunted
This-this-this-this-this the type of shit my life is all about
Check the Forbes list, you know I'm ballin' out
They say, "Logic, you too humble, boy, just let it out"
Fuck 'em all then, I'ma dead it now
Like oh, I think I know, I think I know
This flow, this super flow, out of control
Like whoa, this shit like whoa, I think I know
Like whoa, like, like whoa, like, like, like...

[Pre-Chorus: Logic]
This that flexicution
This is what the people say they wanted from the young boy
From thefrom thefrom the god
This that flexicution
This is what the people say they wanted from the rap god
From thefrom thefrom the god

Everything I do, you know I do it for the squad

[Verse 2: Logic]
Hold on, let me bring it back
Everybody know I'm bringing the facts
And they wonder why I got it like that
'Cause I put everything right on the track
And you know I'ma fuck around and let it go
I been living like woah, I been living, you already know
And these motherfuckers wanna take up on every mistake
And I'm showing where I'm going
And I'm knowing what I'm doing, intuition never switching
On a mission, motherfucker, why is you bitching? Why is you bitching?
Like God damn, I'm like (Oh God)
Hold up, wait a minute, they ain't ready for the hook
It's another day, another book
I feel like Indiana in Atlanta, hotter than Havana
Coming with the stamina
Bitch, put down your camera, and live in the moment
This shit right here, everybody gon' want it, so what up wit it?
Any and everybody talk about the boy changing
Y'all can just shut up wit it 'cause I know
Ain't none of y'all getting the flow, boy...

[Pre-Chorus: Logic]
This that flexicution
This is what the people say they wanted from the young boy
From thefrom thefrom the god
This that flexicution
This is what the people say they wanted from the rap god
From thefrom thefrom the god

[Outro: Jess Andrea, (John Lindahl) & Logic]
I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know
It's been a hell of a ride up (it's been a hell of a ride up)
Hell of a ride up (it's been a hell of a ride up)
I know, I know, I know, I know, I know
That I've been M.I.A, but I was tied up
Till I heard you talking shit, now I'm fired up
5-0 triple 0[Intro]
Yeah

[Chorus]
I'm the one, bitch, I am the one, like Keanu Reeves
Get it done, yeah, I get it done, no blood on the leaves
They can't leave us hangin', no, no, not no more, best believe
Yeah, that shit is banging, Bobby killed it with no time to grieve
I'm the one, bitch, I am the one, like Keanu Reeves
Get it done, yeah, I get it done, no blood on the leaves
They can't leave us hangin', no, no, not no more, best believe
Yeah, that shit is banging, Bobby killed it with no time to grieve, ayy

[Verse 1]
At the Garden, sitting courtside, look around like, "Oh my God"
I just sold this motherfucker out, I ain't even try
I ain't one to floss, but I got plaques, run it back
Once I touch down, I go deep like a running back
Just jumped on the private jet and rolled a joint
Played the beat then wrote that joint
Wrote a whole movie, then I sold that joint
Fuck Illuminati, that boy 6ix got my back
6ix made this beat, 6ix bring the heat you got on repeat
Word on the street
Can't no one compete, I'm spectacular
That boy got the sauce on the RAG-lar
I don't play no games 'less we talkin' Fortnite
Finally knew I made it, sittin' at the red light
When them soccer moms pull up in they van while I ride
Like, "Oh my God, children, it's the 1-800 guy"
But my doors suicide, yeah, I'm too alive
Bitch, I have arrived, everybody know I'm one hell of a guy
I ain't tryna fuck your girl, I'm tryna fuck your mama
Fuck the drama, bank account got a extra comma
Yeah, they sweat me like the sauna
Red carpet in my own merch, like that shit is designer
Did you know I'm mixed like Obama?
It ain't a project if Logic ain't talkin' 'bout being biracial
Bicoastal, I'm platinum, go postal, I'm snappin'
Yeah, you know Bobby, but prolly' only know my new shit
That trap shit, that cool shit, but they all know that fool spit

[Chorus]
I'm the one, bitch, I am the one, like Keanu Reeves
Get it done, yeah I get it done, no blood on the leaves
They can't leave us hangin', no, no, not no more, best believe
Yeah, that shit is banging, Bobby killed it with no time to grieve
I'm the one, bitch, I am the one, like Keanu Reeves
Get it done, yeah, I get it done, no blood on the leaves
They can't leave us hangin', no, no, not no more, best believe
Yeah, that shit is banging, Bobby killed it with no time to grieve, ayy

[Verse 2]
Yeah, you know you made it when they make a meme for ya
Haters that never made it, I'm livin' the dream for ya
Roll up, grab the kush and then roll up
Hold up, better give me what I want when I show up
You know what I do, not who coming through
How 'bout you?
Fuck you, fuck you, fuck you, you're cool
I don't fuck with nobody like mean girls in high school
I don't give a damn that I'm famous
Why it seem like every single celebrity shameless, it's dangerous
Got 50 million but my swag on food stamps
All these models poppin' bottles, bitch, I ain't tryna dance
She said, "No, I don't wanna pay my bills"
I need a hard workin' woman with respect who will
This for everybody who ain't made it yet
Got five degrees and six figures in debt
Follow your dreams ho, follow your follow your, uh
Somebody calling your, uh, it's destiny
Hold up with the turn up for a second man, who's testing me?
I got so much power, don't know why the heavens blessing me
PLP, I think that is the recipe
So I'ma take a moment, use my power for good
Fuck the bullshit, do what you love and get out the hood

[Chorus]
I'm the one, bitch, I am the one, like Keanu Reeves
Get it done, yeah I get it done, no blood on the leaves
They can't leave us hangin', no, no, not no more, best believe
Yeah, that shit is banging, Bobby killed it with no time to grieve
I'm the one, bitch, I am the one, like Keanu Reeves
Get it done, yeah, I get it done, no blood on the leaves
They can't leave us hangin', no, no, not no more, best believe
Yeah, that shit is banging, Bobby killed it with no time to grieve, ayy[Intro]
Ayo, shout out to Black Diamond
I got them Nikes on my feet as we speak, homie
Shout out to Mac Miller

[Chorus]
All I do is rhyme, all I do is get this money
All I do is grind, play shows and chill with honeys
All I do is shine, tour the world, ain't it funny?
I'm one of a kind (Sinatra)
All I do is rhyme, all I do is get this money
All I do is grind, play shows and chill with honeys
All I do is shine, tour the world, ain't it funny?
I'm one of a kind

[Verse 1]
Ugh, yeah
My name is Logic, if you don't know by now, I'm always on my grind
And at this moment in time, Im on a road when I write this rhyme
Sitting behind Raheem Devaughn while hes passed out
'Bout to hit the station 'fore our gas is out
Look outside the window, I see shorties with they asses out, oh my
Good god, you know we fly
Day dreaming out the window, watch how buildings pass me by
See I aint signed but at this point in time
I'm feeling like the 3-6-8th
Wonder of the world, just might steal your girl
All I do is rhyme and get money, thats my repertoire
Holla at honeys, "Voulez-vous coucher avec moi, ce soir?"
Baby whats the deal, have you ever heard of some shit so real?
(Cudi what up?)

[Bridge]
Its going down, feeling like a millionaire
Riding with the top down, while the rest of the world just stare

[Chorus]
All I do is rhyme, all I do is get this money
All I do is grind, play shows and chill with honeys
All I do is shine, tour the world, ain't it funny?
I'm one of a kind
Al-al-al-all I do is rhyme, all I do is get this money
All I do is grind, play shows and chill with honeys
All I do is shine, tour the world, ain't it funny?
I'm one of a kind

[Verse 2]
Yeah
This is the joint that when you hear it you like, "Thats my shit!"
Maybe at a house party while you getting lit
Or while you cruising 'round town riding in a whip
One things for sure, you better get all of your friends here
If a shorty like my music, then she a (Bobbysoxer)
Got a booty, know how to use it, homie yes I rocks her
The second I jump on a stage, Im rocking it, aint nobody stoppin'
It
Whoever goes on after me, Im sorry, you aint topping it

[Bridge]
Its going down, feeling like a millionaire
Riding with the top down, while the rest of the world just stare

[Chorus]
All I do is rhyme, all I do is get this money
All I do is grind, play shows and chill with honeys
All I do is shine, tour the world, ain't it funny?
I'm one of a kind
Al-al-al-all I do is rhyme, all I do is get this money
All I do is grind, play shows and chill with honeys
All I do is shine, tour the world, ain't it funny?
I'm one of a kind

[Verse 3]
Ever since I was a youngin I knew Id break in the game
While you worshiped other rappers that leave you less entertained
I was strategizing before the people knew my name
Fame what I shall attain on the road to success
Bumping Jay in the H.O.V. lane
Searching for wisdom in women but only getting brain
Yo quiero dormir contigo mi amorcito
I know we fight, but thats poquito
Unless you do me foul like a free throw, then we finito

[Chorus]
All I do is rhyme, all I do is get this money
All I do is grind, play shows and chill with honeys
All I do is shine, tour the world, ain't it funny?
I'm one of a kind
Al-al-al-all I do is rhyme, all I do is get this money
All I do is grind, play shows and chill with honeys
All I do is shine, tour the world, ain't it funny?
I'm one of a kind[Verse 1: Logic]
Okay, it's RattPack 'til my pulse flat
We keep it real, no false rap
I got four cars and they all black
Got four broads and they all that
We call that "ballin'," doin' this is my callin'
Flow is so appallin', my phone off and she callin'
I'm like, "Yeah, what it do?"
Penthouse, man, what a view
Fall back, 'cause I'm coming through with my whole team, they coming too
That's real, too real, motherfucker, tell me how you feel
I'm too good for my own good, I won't leak the album, I'll let it spill
Number one, bitch, I bet it will, do the numbers I said it will
I played the game and I'm still the same and I never changed just to get a deal

[Chorus: Logic]
Bitch, I'm ballin', ballin'
I came from nothin' to somethin' like it's nothin'
Yeah, you know I done it, nah, there's no discussion
Bitch, I'm ballin', ballin', I made a promise to my mama
I'ma turn these zeros into 10's and commas
Bitch, I'm ballin', ballin', closin' million dollar deals
Catch me swervin', burning hundred dollar bills, how it feel
When you ballin', ballin', goin' places they'll never go
It ain't all about the money, but I stack it 'cause you never know

[Verse 2: Logic]
I'ma live life 'til I overdose while they sleepin' on me, that's comatose
I went mainstream with my main team
You just mad as fuck, you ain't come close
And your next girl is my ex-girl, she fine as hell, but she a mess girl
All I do is rhyme, I got no time, so I can't reply to your text, girl
Bitch I'm back again and I'll run it
Always gotta keep it 100
All of y'all know y'all want it, turn it up and get blunted
I'm like, "Fuck the money, fuck the fame"
I came here to fuck up the game, gon' get it, I'm feelin' myself
Fresh to death, bitch, I'm killin' myself; I'm gone
We burnin' it up, step in the building, we turnin' it up
Talkin' that shit, but they'll never admit
When I step to the mic I be murderin' it
And we livin' real good, mainstream, but it's still good
I got raw shit, I got real shit
But right now it's time for that feel good
We call that "ballin'", doin' this is my callin'
Flow is so appallin', my phone off and she callin'
I'm like, "Yeah, what it do?", penthouse, man, what a view
Fall back, 'cause I'm coming through
With my whole team, they coming too

[Chorus: Logic]
That's ballin', ballin'
I came from nothin' to somethin' like it's nothin'
Yeah, you know I done it, nah, there's no discussion
Bitch, I'm ballin', ballin', I made a promise to my mama
I'ma turn these zeros into 10's and commas
Bitch, I'm ballin', ballin', closin' million dollar deals
Catch me swervin', burning hundred dollar bills, how it feel
When you ballin', ballin', goin' places they'll never go
It ain't all about the money, but I stack it 'cause you never know

[Verse 3: Shy Grey]
Yeah, you know that we ballin', we been goin' all-in
Hold on, let me slow it down, so y'all get the shit
These haters talk, but I don't give a shit
Got models, bottles, and the piff is lit
But we ballin', kinda like Spalding and Rawlings
On the road to riches never stallin'
Got your girl all up all on my nuts
But she do it with joy, no almonds, ugh
Living life to perfection, V.I.P., that's the section
Presidential watch, presidential suites
You would think we held an election
It go Logic first, then I'm up next
I do not converse, I just cut checks
I do not rehearse, I just drop the verse
I need to cop a hearse, 'cause I'm fresh to death
I bet you never seen so much designer
Never seen a nigga with a bitch that's finer
Boy, I stunt when I ain't even tryna
Swaggin' is nice, but first I'ma rhymer
And I rep Maryland, home of the Terrapins
Say you spit crack, homie, we spit that heroin
Bring it right to your front door like I'm carolin'
Standing next to me would be so embarrassin'
Yeah, we be

[Chorus: Logic]
Ballin', ballin'
I came from nothin' to somethin' like it's nothin'
Yeah, you know I done it, nah, there's no discussion
Bitch, I'm ballin', ballin', I made a promise to my mama
I'ma turn these zeros into 10's and commas
Bitch, I'm ballin', ballin', closin' million dollar deals
Catch me swervin', burning hundred dollar bills, how it feel
When you ballin', ballin', goin' places they'll never go
It ain't all about the money, but I stack it 'cause you never know[Verse 1]
Goddamn, goddamn, conversations with legends
Crazy how one day yo' idols can turn into your brethren
Bitches we severin', hit up my jeweler, watch him freeze us
Breaking bread like I'm Jesus
Money ain't everything, but somehow eases
Better believe than think down and leave us, the baby cryin'
Crack cookin' where my sister be fryin' soul food
Plus my other sister just went back to her old dude
He whoopin' her assI'll kill him, I'll kill him
I'll motherfuckin' kill him
I said, I really want to kill himbut I can't
'Cause if I do, po-po gon' claim I'm the villain, but I ain't
See my vision from pictures I paint
Do you feel it like I feel it?
I grip the mic and then kill itokay, I'm gone
As memories resurface from hella long in my past
Chillin, sippin' Sinatra from a flask
Little Bobby, just a youngin, skating was my hobby
Tryna stay out of trouble, my homie in jail for robbery
Welfare, food stamps, and stealing from the sto'
Come home and see an eviction notice taped to my do'
Cant take no mo', mama on drugs, daddy M.I.A
What can I say? I just wanted to be a kid and play
To this day, I pay homage to the gods, to the greats
Never stolen, Im from Maryland
Where they shoot you in the dark of the night
Like Christopher Nolan, for talking outta your colon
Catch me rollin with the realest
Lyricism the illest, my chain is the chillest, Sub Zero
Far from a hero, bitch, Im De Niro in Goodfellas
If your bitch around me, best bring an umbrella
Let me tap into my inner southern killer, none other illa
Murder the game and then resurrect it like "Thriller"
Yeah, my skin is vanilla, but bitch I dare ya to test my killa
We dont do it for the skrilla, we do it for love
Word to my homies up above, we slingin' like drugs
And overdose 'em like the dealer does (Logic)
Yeah

[Break: Thalia]
Hip-hop

[Chorus 1]
I swear this music in my genes like Denim
Lyricism seep in 'em like venom
Yes, I know the flow hotter than Lucifer, even though heaven sent him, uh

[Verse 2]
See my vision as I've elevated and risen
Open your eyes, despise lies told with deadly precision
I finally made my way up out that section 8 division
Not by busting and killing though I've had my share of stealin'
But by putting pen to this pad and dispersin' these feelings
While the label only care about making a killin'
Feel my energyI ain't talking E-N-E-R-G-Y, I mean inner G
That's the shit they never see
But I own supremacy, number oneI better be
Bitch, I said, "I bet I be."
Take my kindness for weakness, trying to get the better of me
Tell me, how is they gon' remember me?
As the artist that concocted the perfect recipe?
Or will they be addressing me, talking less of me
Just 'cause I was different
Just 'cause I was doing what I love?
And the fans say they love you, but they push and they shove
'Cause they want what they want how they want when they want it
I just gave them twenty songs, now they want another hunnid
I just see it as a challenge, I could do it, bitch, I run it
Worldwide tours, type of shit I always wanted
While the rest of 'em just worry 'bout bitches and gettin' blunted
Still that same motherfucker from that YS1
Only difference: I'm stronger and better from when I begun
So when people that never knew me they tell me that I changed
That my music is different and my vision's rearranged, I just stop
And do my best to refrain
From having conversations with people that ain't in my lane
Will I die? (Will I die?) Will I live?
Give the world everything I have to give
This is feelings on the page, know my wisdom, not my age
Understand that I'm a man not defined by his wage
Even though it's in the millions, that shit don't define my brilliance
Open your mind and maybe you can see the billions
Of people that separated, but all equal
To know the ending, one must understand the prequel, uh

[Chorus 2]
I swear this music in my genes like Denim
Lyricism seep in 'em like venom
Yes, I know the flow hotter than Lucifer even though heaven sent him
Spit it like Holy water, prophetically repent 'em
Then we gone[Intro: Logic & Big Lenbo]
Yeah yeah, what up Bobby
Like goddamn, like goddamn
This that 9-5 shit right here
Take 'em back to the 90s!
Like goddamn, like goddamn
Yo yo yo yo yo, yo yo yo

[Verse 1: Logic]
Okay now take a trip inside my mind like you was off to Venice
It's me and B-I-G L-N-B-O cookin' like chemists
Take them back to way back when, like Dennis the Menace
Causin' mayhem on the come up like a young apprentice
Smokin' weed and gettin' higher than a flight attendant
Hip-hop descendant, gold Jesus on my pendant
Got to pull it out for everyone that's in attendance
Okay, back in the day as a College Park tenant
Still can't believe I didn't get a shorty pregnant
Man, that's the definition of a life sentence
A whole lot of beef, no bread, no lettuce
'Cause I couldn't keep it in my briefs, man that's pathetic
Fuck all that back and forth, this ain't a game of tennis
I'll be in my mothafuckin' chamber like the senate
Scared to go outside but I know I can't prevent it
I'm, forever alone in my mind (yeah yeah)
See I'm a self diagnosed hypochondriac
Either at the crib, or on the tour bus is where you'll find me at
Yeah, I know that I'm livin' like I got it okay, yeah
But I swear that I'm not that neurotic over here, yeah

[Hook: Logic]
Over here, over here
Over here, over here
Over here, over here
Over here, over here

[Verse 2: Big Lenbo & Logic]
Ayo, fuck all that, it's the fat young Jesus; flow prestigious
Stackin' money and playin' the field man like Regis
Better believe us or leave us
Grabbin' your bitch's cleavage like, "woo-hah"
I went from surveyin' to Super Saiyan slayin' the man
Bitches want an autograph
I sign them titties in crayon, like goddamn!
It's me and B-I-G L-N-B-O cookin' like chemists
It's me and B-I, B-I, B-I-G L-N-B-O, L-N-B-O
Posted in the club in baggy jeans and a beanie
Sippin' on a martini, takin' my pick at bitches like eenie meenie
I'm unscannable, young cannibal, eat wack MCs like Hannibal
'Cause Joe Pesci's my spirit animal

[Hook: Logic]
Over here, over here
Over here, over here
Over here, over here
Over here, over here

[Verse 3: Logic & Big Lenbo]
Okay the flow delicious, bounty huntin' like Sid Vicious
The young Spiegel, interstellar with my retrieval
Furthest from evil, I throw this shit back like medieval
I spit at it like a Beretta
You know I get better by givin' the people
Not a fuck given, check the method, that's how we livin'
Always been driven, out of sight and yet never hidden
"The Return of the Jedi"
Bitch I bet I do the show and catch a red eye
Ho I said I leave 'em dead, I know I do
This shit is (overdue, pass me the fifth and I'm comin' through)
The B-I-G L-E-N-B-O on the way to Rio
Ay dios mio, lookin' for a Latin Leo
To hold a brother down like the white man
Fuck that nigga
Ayo enough's enough, man of my word, I never bluff
Even in a pair of cuffs, know we always keep it real
Like goddamn, don't even step like I ain't the man
I'm just (301 reppin', second I step in Maryland)
I gotta conceal it like a murder weapon
I kept in the glove, Ratt Pack you know it's all love
We the realest so fuck you if you ain't feel this
Throw a Molotov in your crib
And tell them bitches to bill us, we the illest
Finger fuck a critic
Shit is darker than "The Chronicles of Riddick"
Yes I did it, while they bit it, you know we got it
Smack you with the palm, save the back for your mom
Sound the alarm, you know we got it goin' on[Verse 1]
Living good, I've been living good
Rolling through my hood, understood
Just a youngin in this bitch up to no good
In the whip, every day with Nikki she be riding with me
Never trip, rolling through my city with hundreds and fifties
Out the blue, like a Crip
But I never bang, no, they know
We've been at it way before the fame, ho
(Way before the fame)
We've been at it way before the fame, ho
(Way before the...)
We've been at it way before the fame, psyche
Take a trip, little trip, life is what you make of it
I've been focused on this music, can't fuck with no basic bitch
Let me switch, the flow up, the flow up a little bit
No I ain't just tryna hit, hit, get with this
Bounce if you really 'bout it, but I doubt it, yes I do
Seems like all this new shit really just left over residue
I'm coming through, if I see your bitch I bet she coming too
What it do, we ain't never switch it up, we keep it true

[Chorus]
Out the blue, like a Crip
But I never bang though
They know, we've been at it way before the fame, ho
Way before the fame, ho
At it way before the, way before the fame ho (Bounce)
Way before the, way before the fame ho (Bounce)
Way before the fame (Bounce)
Way before the fame (Bounce)
Way before the, at it way before the fame (Bounce)
Way before the fame, at it way before the fame
We've been at it way before the fame
(Ridin' with my homies that be down with me)
(Pop bottles with my homies that be down with me)

[Verse 2]
Back again, like I never left
Had to take a breath
Cause Nikki been fucking with me hardcore
God, goddamn, that's my fucking jam
They know who I am
Bitch bounce, homie smoke a ounce
Fuck it, make it count
With my album date announced, I pronounce I'm a killa
Bumping everything from Project Pat to Dilla
It's, truly disgusting the amount of money that we gross
Coast to coast, nationwide tour, then we hit the world
Rub a dub, if your bitch bad, we might hit your girl
RattPack, know the deal
What's the motto? Keep it real!
(I know) I got it, I want it, I need it
We live in an era where they get deleted
I'm wondering if I'ma make it
Man fuck it, I'll take it, that record I'll break it
These bitches they love it, but I never covet
I just keep it going that's why I be flowing
I'm already knowing this life that I'm living
Don't know what I'm given
It's so hard not to give in

[Chorus]
Out the blue, like a Crip
But I never bang though
They know, we've been at it way before the fame, ho
Way before the fame, ho
At it way before the, way before the fame ho (Bounce)
Way before the, way before the fame ho (Bounce)
Way before the fame (Bounce)
Way before the fame (Bounce)
Way before the, at it way before the fame (Bounce)
Way before the fame, at it way before the fame
We've been at it way before the fame
(Ridin' with my homies that be down with me)
(Pop bottles with my homies that be down with me)

[Outro: Thalia]
Locations where the album was recorded include: No I.D's studio in Los Angeles, Logic's house in the hills, and various hotels across the country throughout the duration of the tour...[Verse 1: Logic]
I feel the Aryan in my blood, it's scarier than a Blood
Been looking for holy water, now Im praying for a flood
It feel like time passing me by slower than a slug
While this feeling inside of my body seep in like a drug
Will you hug me, rub me on the back like a child?
Tell me you love me, need me
Promise me youll never leave me
Even though my daddy, you know he blacker than the street
With a fist to match, more solid than concrete
Tell white people Im black, feel the need to retreat
Like I should be ashamed of my granddaddy Malik
But my beautiful black brothers and sisters
Want to act like Im adopted
Go back in time to when my nigga daddy
Impregnated my cracker momma and stopped it

[Refrain: Logic]
My oh my (My oh my)
Oh my (My oh my)
I said oh my (Oh my)

[Verse 2: Logic]
Somebody pinch me
Black man screaming, trying to convince me Im not black
So why the white man wanna lynch me?
Damn, my skin fair but lifes not
And I'd be lying if I said I didnt care what whites thought
Or black people said, shit
Maybe its in my head
Like a single mother praying In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida
Looking around on the ground for a serpent to feed her
Praying to God, wondering why her baby daddy beat her
Feeling like the devil finna come and defeat her
All alone in the wintertime, close to the heater
Wondering whats gonna happen
And how the world gonna treat her
How could her momma mislead her
And her daddy just leave her?
Like abracadabra when that magician pull on the lever
Oh my

[Chorus: Logic]
(Oh my) Oh my
(Oh my) Like the white woman said oh my
Oh my, my, my, my, my
Ohhh
Oh my, my, my, my, my
Oh my
I dont feel right deep inside
Feeling like I need to hide
Everybody wonder why I get high
'Cause I cant fight the feeling inside
Oh my, my, my
Oh my, I said oh my, yeah

[Verse 3: Logic]
Feeling innocent in a sense has got me feeling on the fence
And all this shit is so intense
Dont wanna go to this event
Just wanna stay home and invent
And somehow, yeah, that let me vent
Im taking shots and drinking liquor
But that shit dont make a dent in how Im feeling
And yes Im willing to keep chilling on this shit
I know there's someone out there far away
Who's feeling all this shit
And yes I know that when Im low
There's so much further I can go
And so I look up to the sky
Oh my, oh my

[Refrain: Logic]
(Oh my, oh my) Oh my, oh my
(Oh my, oh my) Oh my, oh my
(Oh my, oh my) Oh my, oh my
(I said oh)

[Verse 4: Logic]
I feel the Aryan in my blood, it's scarier than a Blood
Been looking for holy water, now Im praying for a flood
It feel like time passing me by slower than a slug
While this feeling inside of my body seep in like a drug
Will you hug me, rub me on the back like a child?
Tell me you love me, need me
Promise me youll never leave me
Even though my daddy, you know he blacker than the street
With a fist to match, more solid than concrete
Tell white people Im black, feel the need to retreat
Like I should be ashamed of my granddaddy Malik
But my beautiful black brothers and sisters
Want to act like Im adopted
Go back in time to when my nigga daddy
Impregnated my cracker momma and stopped it
My oh my (My oh my)
Oh my (My oh my)
Like the white woman said oh my (Oh my)
Single mother praying In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida
Looking around on the ground for a serpent to feed her
Praying to God, wondering why her baby daddy beat her
Feeling like the devil finna come and defeat her
Single mother praying In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida
Looking around on the ground for a serpent to feed her
Praying to God, wondering why her baby daddy beat her
Feeling like the devil finna come and defeat her
Single mother praying In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida
Looking around on the ground for a serpent to feed her
Praying to God, wondering why her baby daddy beat her
Feeling like the devil finna come and defeat her
All alone in the wintertime, close to the heater
Wondering whats gonna happen

How could her momma mislead her
And her daddy just leave her?
Like abracadabra when that magician pull on the lever
Oh my

[Chorus: Logic]
Oh my, my, my, my, my
Ohhh
Oh my, my, my, my, my
Oh my
I dont feel right deep inside
Feeling like I need to hide
Everybody wonder why I get high
Cause I cant fight the feeling inside
Oh my, my, my
Oh my, I said oh my

[Bridge: Logic]
Sometimes I cant get you out of my mind
Baby, no I just cant find, I just cant find
Such a beautiful state of mind
Beautiful state of mind, such a beautiful state of mind
Beautiful state of mind
Sometimes everyday right on time
But right now in my mind
It feels like I'm living on borrowed time

[Verse 5: Logic]
I feel the Aryan in my blood, it's scarier than a Blood
Been looking for holy water, now Im praying for a flood
It feel like time passing me by slower than a slug
While this feeling inside of my body seep in like a...
Will you hug me, rub me on the back like a child?
Tell me you love me, need me
Promise me youll never leave me
Even though my daddy, you know he blacker than the street
With a fist to match, more solid than con...
Tell white people Im black, feel the need to retreat
Like I should be ashamed of my granddaddy Malik
But my beautiful black brothers and sisters
Want to act like Im adopted
Go back in time to when my nigga daddy
Impregnated my cracker momma and stopped it
My oh my, oh my
Feeling innocent, oh my
Feeling innocent in a sense has got me feeling on the fence
And all this shit is so intense
Dont wanna go to this event
Just wanna stay home and invent
And somehow, yeah, that let me vent
Im taking shots and drinking liquor
But that shit dont make a dent in how Im feeling
And yes Im willing to keep chilling on this shit
I know there's someone out there far away
Who's feeling all this shit
And yes I know that when Im low
There's so much further I can go
And so I look up to the sky, to the sky
Like a single mother praying In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida
Looking around on the ground for a serpent to feed her
Praying to God, wondering why her baby daddy beat her
Feeling like the devil finna come and defeat her
All alone in the wintertime, close to the heater
Wondering whats gonna happen
And how the world gonna treat her
How could her momma mislead her
And her daddy just leave her?
Like abracadabra when that magician pull on the lever
How could her momma mislead her
And her daddy just leave her?
Like abracadabra when that magician pull on the lever
How could her momma mislead her
And her daddy just leave her?
Like abracadabra when that magician pull on the lever
How could her momma mislead her
And her daddy just leave her?
Like abracadabra when that magician pull on the lever
How could her momma mislead her
And her daddy just leave her?
Like abracadabra when that magician pull on the lever
Oh my

Atom: So what now? What advice can you give me?
God: What advice can I give humanity?
Atom: I suppose so
God: Live your life. Dont waste your days on the negative energy of others. Remember that youre not your salary. Youre not your house. Youre not your car. And no matter how big your bank account is, your grave is six feet under just like everyone elses. So enjoy the days you have. Worry not about the days that came before you. Nor the ones that will follow you in death. Remember that right here in this moment is all you are guaranteed, and the fact that you are living is what life is all about. So live your life to the fullest, according to your happiness and the betterment of all
Kai: Damn man, weve been walking forever
Thomas: Well, Thalias tracking system says well be there in just over an hour
Kai: Shit, at least we got good walking music or is that it?
Thomas: Oh no, man. Im cueing up the fourth album now, his final one

[Outro: J. Cole]
One, two, three, four
One, two, three, four, listen
Look into my eyes
Tell me you could see beyond the smile that I'm puttin' on
This front that I'm puttin' up for you
I spill my soul into a microphone
With poems written in blood
In hopes that it's enough for you
Do you love me yet?
Do you love me yet?
No? Okay
I'll go harder for you
In fact, I rap till I collapse
All I wanted was acceptance, my latest lesson
I'll never feel your approval till I accept my own
Come from a messed up home, destitute and less informed
About the ways to raise a child up
To not become a product
Of his environment, I need to cry and vent
But I done built this wall up
Actin' like everything's all good
But in reality I'm lookin' for something
Through bumpin' my favorite rappers I came up after
Nas, Cole, and Hov
Eyes closed, I zone till five or so in the morn'
I'm used to being alone
Shit, you know how long I've been out on my own?
Chasing dreams, fantasies of a throne
One day I wake up and see that it didn't exist all along
Till then I will pen verses that fans consider brilliant
Boosting my ego with every million that spills in
And still then
I won't find solace, so where's the logic in that?
Worrying 'bout if they think Logic can rap
When it all just goes back to a childhood, need to be loved
By parents that was in too deep with the drugs
Nigga, my advice, fuck the black and white shit
Be who you are, identify as a star
No one tells you you're that
It's something that you just know
The world be stealing your glow
Your mama did what she could
Her life was miles from good
Your father fell in the trap
They set for you when you black
They met when they was low
And therefore you a product of that
And so your trauma is deep
Don't bury it you should weep
And clean it out of your system, then truly forgive 'em
Just my opinion, only then can you find peace
Just start to notice happiness don't come from album release
I've been through it before
Can only share with you what I know
To be true, but at the same time, I'll never be you
And you'll never be me, no matter how hard that you try
This is for youngins out there wondering how far you can fly
The truth is that you could go further than the stars and the sky
But if you want to then you ought to know why
Are you running from something
With hopes of becoming someone
That's finally worthy of love
Let me tell you now, you're worthy enough
Fuck approval from strangers, that shit is dangerous as hell
Find God, learn to accept yourself
And I'm gone, acceptance[Intro]
Yeah

[Verse 1]
I can't get no better, cant get no more cheddar
I feel like a king and my queen is Coretta
I been made a livin', I'm never gon give in
I'm just way too driven, that's why I been thinkin'
I'm scared that I'm sinkin', I'm scared that Im fallin
The world think I'm ballin and maybe I am
But don't give a damn, back in the beginnin'
Did not have a plan, don't know who I am
Or who Im becomin' but I'ma do me to the fullest, alright
Bustin' and dodgin' them bullets all night
Take over the world, yeah I'm thinkin' I might
Got 'em all in my sight
I know that I'm strong, I know that I am
I know I'm the man
And whether you poor or you filled with financial security
Everyone deal with they own insecurity
Even the preacher was born with impurity
Scared to go out even with my security
Scared of the world and all of its obscurity
Pray for maturity, hope that I grow
Hope my anxiety stay on the low
I swear I hope that shit don't fuck up my flow
Where do I go? What would you do
If suddenly all of your dreams came true?
What would you do if you did it all?
If you ain't never have to lift a finger
Would you linger like, "Fuck 'em all"?
Guess that's your call, but I can't
This a marathon, not a sprint
Switch up the plan like homie that went from Verizon to Sprint
Can you hear me now? Does anybody out there feel me now?

[Chorus]
What's your name? What's your game?
Come now, boy, just spit your flow
Feel the pain with the gain, what you tryna say though?
Novocaine to the brain, I can't feel nothing no mo'
In my lane, can't refrain from lettin' these people know
What's your name? What's your game?
Come now, boy, just spit your flow
Feel the pain with the gain, what you tryna say though?
Novocaine to the brain, I can't feel nothing no mo'
In my lane, can't refrain from lettin' these people know

[Interlude]
How I feel (How I feel), yeah that's how I feel (That's how I feel)
Break it down, roll it up, that's how high I feel (That's how high I feel)
How I feel (How I feel), how high I feel (How high I feel)
Down, roll it up, yeah

[Verse 2]
Searchin' for bliss only led me to searchin' for hits
Only led me to battle depression
I done learned my lesson 'cause fame never lessen the pain
What if your life was under a glass?
And people tried to dig up shit from your past
And tell you what's good and what's not
And every time you drop a song, they say that it's wack or it's hot
And don't give a damn that it came from the heart
They tear it apart like hyenas, this here for the dreamers
This here for the people that know what I'm sayin'
All of the people that know what I'm sayin'
Fuck social media
Tellin' me who I should be and just how I should rap
They always compare, they always compare me to others
And try to hit me up against all my brothers
Now, why you think so many rappers be overdosin' at the crib?
(Overdosin' at the crib)
'Cause people just won't let 'em live
And the public is constantly thinkin' they know 'em
But nobody knowin' what's goin' on inside
And they wonder why we all hide, shit
Maybe I'm just overthinkin'
Or maybe I'm just over-smokin' and drinkin'
And when I can't deal with the hate, I self-medicate
Sit in the corner and think of a better day
Maybe this bullet can help me to get away
I just cannot seem to think of a better way
Even though I know there is, that's why I keep goin'
That's why I keep flowin', that's why I keep perserverin'
Even when I'm hearin' I'm a bitch, I'm a fag
I'm a motherfuckin' hypebeast, I ain't black in the slight least
I ain't good enough, I should quit, I should kill myself (Kill myself)
'Cause "you'll never be Kenny"
"You'll never be better than Drizzy or Cole"
"You're losing your hair, you're too fucking old," yeah
These are the comments I'm readin' on Twitter right now
That make me depressed and they pullin' me down
I'm tryin' to swim but I think I'ma drown
So I'ma turn that feelin' into a sound
And play it when nobody else is around
Whenever I feel like I'm far from the ground
God, give me the power to battle depression
Yeah, round after round
I wish I was famous, I wish I was rich
I wish I could just get up out of this bitch
But be careful what you wish for
'Cause it ain't everything that it's cut out to be
My life is good but not as good as it's 'bout to be
'Cause I got vision, don't fuck with division
Ain't God, but I'm rich and I think that I am
Do what you love and do not give a damn
Fuck all the haters you see on the 'Gram
Just mind your own business and be a good man
Be a good boss and be a good friend
Spread your imagination to the millions
Don't worry 'bout how to maintain all your millions
Just spread that positivity for the children
And all the haters that's hatin', just love 'em
'Cause that's the only way you ever gon' kill 'em
Know somebody feel 'em
Last but not least, put your ego on the shelf
And remember, love yourself
Nah, nah, nah
Put your ego on the shelf and love yourself
Nah, nah, nah
Put your ego on the shelf
And remember, love your'member, love yourself

[Outro]
Nah, nah, nah
Put your ego on the shelf and love yourself
Nah, nah, nah[Chorus]
Tell me how you feel (Tell me how you feel)
I feel like the grass is green
And everything I do is unseen
But I know thats just in my mind
I know everything is just in my mind
Do you really wanna be famous?
Do you really wanna be a superstar?
Do you really wanna get dangerous?
Do you even know where the groupies are?
Bitches out here be shameless
And I really wonder where they parents are
Look around, everything changes
It feels like I've been buried alive
Buried alive

[Verse 1]
Everything happens for a reason
Happens for a reason
People only in your life for seasons
Word to Aunt Viv (Real shit)
Uh, death and taxes thats all we given
You can make a life but cant make a livin'
You can make it work but that still ain't driven
Give a lot but that still ain't givin'
Livin' life like this aint real though
Every night like this I feel so dead wrong
Collision is head on, my vision is dead and gone
Perception of right and wrong
I been here so very long right here in this very song, uh
Look around everything changes
Seem like everybody just strangers
Dont go outside 'cause its dangerous
Why everybody wanna be famous
Im so OCD, if they notice me
I might jump out the grave so they know its me
Man, everybody want this shit for free
Hand out, palm up when they get to me
In my mind, no, I never let it get to me
Everybody got a time, will it get to me?
Vs up motherfucka, thats victory
Tell me why what Im doing aint shit to me, damn

[Pre-Chorus]
Buried alive (Buried alive)
Will I survive? (Buried alive)
I gotta know
Know, know, know, know, know, know, know, know, know, know, know
I gotta know
Know, know, know, know, know, know, know, know, know, know, know, know, know, know
It feels like Ive been buried alive
Buried alive

[Chorus]
Tell me how you feel (Tell me how you feel)
I feel like the grass is green
And everything I do is unseen
But I know thats just in my mind
I know everything is just in my mind
Do you really wanna be famous?
Do you really wanna be a superstar?
Do you really wanna get dangerous?
Do you even know where the groupies are?
Bitches out here be shameless
And I really wonder where they parents are
Look around, everything changes
It feels like I've been buried alive
(Let it breathe)

[Verse 2]
I'm feelin' this villainous feelin' inside of my mind
Every time that Im willing I feel like I'm killin' my dreams
When that voice goes nah, nah, nah
Listen up now, love it or hate it
Never debate it, you can never degrade it
While all these other motherfuckers
Probably thinking I made it
My mind jaded, noI never evade it
I elevate it just to keep it innovative (innovative)
God damn, bring it back now, blowin' up like Iraq now
RattPack put me on the map now
No, we never back down
Just take my time, I just take my time
I know, I'ma get it like this
So everyone know that I did it like this
Yeah, I knowI'ma take my time
Battle the image inside of my mind
I know, I'ma keep going
Tell me I can't but I'm already knowing
I know, I'm gonna rise even though I've been

[Pre-Chorus]
Buried alive (Buried alive)
Will I survive? (Buried alive)
I gotta know
Know, know, know, know, know, know, know, know, know, know, know
I gotta know
Know, know, know, know, know, know, know, know, know, know, know, know, know, know
It feels like Ive been buried alive
Buried alive

[Chorus]
Tell me how you feel (Tell me how you feel)
I feel like the grass is green
And everything I do is unseen
But I know thats just in my mind
I know everything is just in my mind
(Let it breathe)

[Outro: Thalia]
OutKast, A Tribe Called Quest, The Red Hot Chili Peppers, and films by Quentin Tarantino were in rotation constantly throughout the duration of this album's creation...

[Produced By: Dun Deal & Logic][Intro: Logic]
It's 2 bars? Aight...

[Verse 1: Logic]
Motherfuckers wanna get famous bust guns and get dangerous
(dangerous)
Daddy graduated from Cambridge yeah, money talks in every language
Real recognize that stainless, silver spoon what my aim is
Y'all don't know what that game is, y'all don't know what that, uh
Y'all 'bout that fraternity life
If you're from where I'm from then as soon as you come
Baby girl gon' be about that maternity life
If you do like my daddy then she gonna be single and alone
That maternity life for eternity life
Eternity life probably thinking we livin' that life
Cause we do what we do, but hold up let me get it right
Everybody got problems, everybody got problems
But not everybody need a .45 to solve them, revolve them (ba-ba-ba-ba)
Take care of all of them like this, I might just go crazy all the way
Y'all live that life where your safety is only a call away
But not us, mommy and daddy never bought us
Not a god damn thing but they brought us
Broke as hell we couldn't fund the trust
Outside run around with a gun to bust
Police looking for every one of us
Back then yeah all of that was fun to us
Had a little bit of money in the middle, let me hit 'em with a riddle
If I never had a dark night I might not-not-not
Not be the samemight not be the

[Pre-Chorus: Logic]
I know my mind is sober, but I'm so high, it's over
I know my mind is sober, but I'm so high, it's over

[Chorus: Dria]
Ay, hey now boy?
You don't know nothing about this, right here boy
Chilling in Maryland, three niggas in a Cadillac lac-lac
You don't know nothin' bout that Chi town
South Central with the gang, gang, gang
Niggas in the projects, for them niggas tryna eat
Get the fuck up off your silver

[Verse 2: Logic]
Everybody wanna live lavish, a million in the bank on average
They cutthroat yeah they savage
They riding round with the baddest (bitch)
One day I woke up, and said I'm bout to do this
For the rest of my life, no question it's right
Waiting for the bus at a stop light
Looking at the cop right in front of my eyes
Living in a world of lies, where the truth dies
And hatred multipliesmu-mu-mu-multi
Multiplies, I said I can't take it
I remember wondering if I would ever make it
But as I reminisce I realise it was all irrelevant, it's evident
I'm getting money for the hell of it
Never fuck around, so the flow celibate
Speaking for the people like a delegate
And when the situation's delicate
I execute it with the proper etiquette
Everybody wanna get ahead of it, no, I can't take the time to stop
It ain't all about the money so I'm headed to the top
But I'm still getting guap never stop unless a body drop
Metaphorical motherfucker to get it in
While the whole world spin for the dividend
But I'm in another system
Everybody hate till he dead then they miss 'em
Why can't we relax and listen?
Stop spending money on things that glisten-glisten-glisten-glisten

[Pre-Chorus: Logic]
I know my mind is sober, but I'm so high, it's over
I Know my mind is sober, but I'm so high, it's over

[Chorus: Dria]
Ay, hey now boy?
You don't know nothing about this, right here boy
Chilling in Maryland, three niggas in a Cadillac lac-lac
You don't know nothin' bout that Chi town
South Central with the gat gat gat
Niggas in the projects, for them niggas tryna eat
Get the fuck up off your silver spoon[Verse 1]
It's the type of shit that they read about
Like Chris said, I gotta bleed it out
I've been in the zone, I can't be without
This real shit that I be about
I'm a visionary, that's long term
But Def Jam, said they need it out
If I rush this shit, I might be without
But I need a vision, can't see without
I've been patient, never complacent
Left the underground when I left the basement
That's renovation, I spit this verse like a revelation
On the road with Kid Cudi and B-I-G
Conversations with No I.D
Who made hits with Ye, got hits with JAY
Now he wanna fuck around and make hits with me
If it's meant to be, then it's meant to be
Can't express what that meant to me, what it mean to me
Man, I swear the shit like a dream to me, what it seemed to be
It's so different now, everything is so different now
I've been there and I've done that
Tell 'em all that I run that, that's a fun fact
And I'm back again cause I love this shit
Write it down and they publish it
I went 5 years without a publicist
'Cause the word of mouth, they in love with this
I've been dreaming, I've been scheming
Went away a while but I've been fiending
I've missed the fam, but they know the deal
Been at it way before the deal
Now the  music got mass appeal
My main girl got ass appeal
Like I feel the vibe, that's the main thing
Little fish, that went mainstream
Now I'm big as fuck
My whole city, they know what's up
I'm unseen and I'm in the cut about extra shit
I don't give a fuck
When I'm on the phone, don't interrupt
If I'm talking business, I might erupt
If you're at the show, put your lighter up
Fuck with me if you're really 'bout it
Outsiders, I could do without it
I crept in, got slept on
Sold out shows, no one knew about it
When it comes to fucks, I give two about it
Your cosign, I could do without it

[Interlude: Dria]
Na, na, na, na, na, na
Na, na, na, na, na, na

[Verse 2]
Okay, last verse I gotta make it count
Won't speak on my bank account
So many commas I'd have to pause
And I can't afford to just waste the bars
Every day, boy, I thank the Lord
I got a lot of problems but could have more
Wish I spoke to my dad more, my jeweler less
I been hungry like Budapest
Tell me who the best, don't give a fuck
I just know I'm blessed
Love life even though I'm stressed
This business boy, I swear a test
Tell Def Jam if they don't cut the check
I'll send Chris to go cut they neck
I love the building, no disrespect
But y'all better ride when I'm in effect
That's radio, that's TV, but Visionary got the internet
If y'all fuck around or try to throw the ball to another artist
I'ma intercept, It's my time
Put half a mil' of my own money in this album
That's my dime; no rap features, just my rhymes
My story, it's all mine, from the basement to the stadium
From the Roxy to Palladium
I've been there and I've done that, yes I run that
With this pretty girl on my floor
Half naked playing Connect Four
But I've been trying to throw sex out the window
Just to connect more
She so fine, type of girl I wanna fuck her mind
And then unwind with some slow head
All my homies like, "go 'head"
Anyway, it's been a long time
And this here has been a long rhyme, so I gotta go
It's Logic, the one nobody would vouch for
How's that shit for an outro?

[Interlude: Dria]
Na, na, na, na, na, na
Na, na, na, na, na, na
This is my story, 'til the end
Na, na, na, na, na, na
Na, na, na, na, na, na
This is my story, 'til the end

[Break]
Yeah yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Y-Yeah, yeah yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah yeah

[Sample]
"Every day that they live and breathe is extended to them!
They may be misinformed about the truth, they may be misguided somebody has led them on the wrong path!
A path of corruption and destruction! But yet, God's mercy every day that they live is extended to them and they have another opportunity to be saved!"

[Break]
Yeah yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Y-Yeah, yeah yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah yeah
Yeah yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Y-Yeah, yeah yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah yeah

[Outro: Thalia]
This concludes the Under Pressure program...[Part I]

[Intro]
Everybody know I be
Everybody know I be
Yeah, yeah...

[Chorus 1]
Everybody know I be
In the club VIP, psych, not me
Old girl wanna fuck me
Yeah, she fine, I'ma give her that D
Out with the homies, I be sippin' on somethin'
Oh shit, I might need an IV, permanently, permanently
Ayy, Goddamn, these bitches is thirsty
They see a rapper but they ignore the band
I ain't talkin' 'bout musicians, you stupid bitch
Talkin' 'bout what's on my hand
Bitch, I been at and in it for a minute
This all been a part of my plan
Sold millions of records before the radio
Damn, it feel good to be the man

[Chorus 1]
Ayy, everybody know I be
In the club VIP, psych, not me
Old girl wanna fuck me
Yeah, she fine, I'ma give her that D
Out with the homies, I be sippin' on somethin'
Oh shit, I might need an IV, permanently, permanently
Goddamn, these bitches is thirsty
They see a rapper but they ignore the band
I ain't talkin' 'bout musicians, you stupid bitch
Talkin' 'bout what's on my hand
Bitch, I been at and in it for a minute
This all been a part of my plan
Sold millions of records before the radio
Damn, it feel good to be the man

[Chorus 1]
Everybody know I be
In the club VIP, psych, not me
Old girl wanna fuck me
Yeah, she fine, I'ma give her that D
Out with the homies, I be sippin' on somethin'
Oh shit, I might need an IV, permanently, permanently

[Part II]

[Chorus 2]
Oh no Bobby, don't do 'em like that
You gon' fuck around and leave 'em ruined like that
RattPack the gang, they all on my back
RattPack the gang, we do it like that
No, don't do 'em like that
You gon' fuck around and leave 'em ruined like that
RattPack the gang, they all on my back
RattPack the gang, we do it like that

[Verse]
Yeah, uh
The illest that bring it, the realest
Bitch, I came to kill this
They can never bear me, just the homies and me
Now we the Grammy family
You made a couple million, that shit is gross
My net is 30, my record clean, my flow is dirty, right?
Real G's move in silence like
Who the common denominator?
Fuck around and bomb a hater
My flow greater, heart darker than Darth Vader
Check the data, matter of fact, check the state of mind
After I'm finished, these rappers ain't in a state to rhyme
Straight to your mind now
Feel this shit like it's some Braille
Way too heavy for the scale
All I know about is bars, like I couldn't make the bail
It ain't never room to fail
Only growing and prevail
When my anxiety rise and I feel like I'm in hell
Take a moment and inhale
Count to five then exhale
Then we run that motherfucker like a marathon
Hits, motherfucker, hits, yeah we 'bout that Barry Bonds
Brace yourself, you can't retain me
All that shit you talkin' out your mouth just won't sustain me
Logic pickin' up the slack like denim
Spit it with venom
Never pretend to be somethin' that I'm not
And you ain't shit when you stand next to me
No kiddin' like vasectomy
Step to me, throw disrespect to me
And I'll rearrange your trajectory
Black and white like a piano and I'm proud to be
And fuck whoever tell me I am not allowed to be
I am me, I'm a man, can I live?Goddamn
Yeah, I guess this shit right here is just all a part of the plan
Haters gon' hate, that's the motherfuckin' sayin'
So much plaque up on my wall I need a dentist
From Maryland to Venice, this shit is worldwide
Step up to the mic and it's a homicide

[Chorus 2]
Oh no Bobby, don't do 'em like that
You gon' fuck around and leave 'em ruined like that
RattPack the gang, they all on my back
RattPack the gang, we do it like that
No, don't do 'em like that
You gon' fuck around and leave 'em ruined like that
RattPack the gang, they all on my back
RattPack the gang, we do it like that[Verse 1]
Sometimes I feel like I've drifted, I feel different I feel gifted
I've been high so long, don't need to smoke to get lifted
I've been under pressure looking for Nikki
Whenever she is around, you know I come quickly
Vivid memories of Chicago, south side where I go
From Reggies to the House of Blues, progress is the motto
Man the first show that I ever done sold out was in Chicago
Yeah, yeah, living like I've been ready to die
Maybe not, I don't know why my mind is changing
Rearranging this dangerous melody, uh
Yeah, and I know that ain't nobody finna ever be ahead of me
All that competition right there is dead to me
Yeah, uh, yeah, I've been turning the pages
Feeling the vibe, shit is outrageous
Boy, I've been feeling courageous
This shit right here, I've been at it for ages
Feels like I'm running through mazes
Everybody has they phases
Yeah, vibe with this, bad bitch in the whip and I ride to this
And I'm feeling it uh, hope when I'm forty I'm still in it
One of the few that be killing it, uh
Yeah, young motherfucker that be giving what he living
On the road to success so you know that I'm driven
But they didn't wanna publish it
But right now I'm on some other shit
I'm in a different world, I'm with a different girl
I'm with the same team, but it's a different scheme
Remember back when I couldn't even pay the bills
And I'll never forget how that feels back when I would

[Refrain 1]
Buy it, break it, roll it, light it, smoke it, inhale it, I'm gone
Buy it, break it, roll it, light it, smoke it, inhale it, I'm gone

[Verse 2]
Okay, doing what I gotta do, flying at this altitude
I look out the window like Goddamn, that's what I really do
Don't know why I fear the planes, sometimes I wish to sustain
If I look back on it I would do it all over again
Nikki, Nikki, where you been? I can't wait to breathe you in
Been on this plane way too long, I can't wait to see you again
Oh my God this turbulence has got me sippin' on this liquor
Crazy, racist, white bitch looking at us
Like, "Who are these niggas?"
First class, on they ass, all complain that's when I dash
Just landed in Europe and this model bitch is tryna smash
Now I'm riding on the train, all this shit inside my brain
Just left a hotel in Belgium, damn them waffles was insane
Smoking blunts in Amsterdam
Oh my God, this is my jam
"May-December" by Mos Def
In my headphones, that's the man

[Refrain 2]
I know, I know that I got it if I, do what I gotta do to get by
And they wonder why I never get high
And they wonder why I never get high
I know, I know that I got it if I, do what I gotta do to get by
And they wonder why I never get high
And they wonder why I never get high

[Verse 3]
Okay, fuck affiliation, I'm that dude that did it on his own
These thoughts inside my mind be fuckin' with me when I'm all alone
I really like this girl she bad as fuck, why must I run away?
It feel like self assassination, I can't put this gun away
God damn, what's the plan? Not complacent where I am
Reminiscing when I hit the road back in that mini van
Broke as fuck, not a dollar, whipping that Chevy Impala
Praying that we make it out this city, Lord willin', Insha'Allah
Up to date the couple years, now my idols are my peers
I was on the road to nowhere till I decided to veer
Put my everything into this shit, you know, I know you know this
Used to give a fuck what people thought, hoping that they would notice
Stop giving a fuck cause music gotta be the only motive
Mind racing on and off the track, I'm going locomotive

[Skit: Logic & Anna]
I can't believe you don't like Tarantino
Ugh, I don't like him because, likewhen it's non like non-Tarantino-esque, I think it's a good movie
You mean like Inglourious Basterds?I didn't see that
What?!I didn't, I don't know
Oh my God! Have you seen 'Pulp Fiction'?
Yeah, but I don't really remember it
What you talking about? Have you seen uh... this is funny cause we're on a train... have you seenfuck! What's his name? The guy from the movie, in the place, on the thing?
On the train? With the scenery?
Uh, I'm tryna remember right now, dammit'Source Code'!
NoYou haven't seen that?
NoWith the dude from 'Donnie Darko'?
Who's that?Oh my God
Well, I still wanna know what your favorite Tarantino movie is...
My favorite Tarantino movie?

[Refrain 2]
I know, I know that I got it if I, do what I gotta do to get by
And they wonder why I never get high
And they wonder why I never get high
I know, I know that I got it if I, do what I gotta do to get by
And they wonder why I never get high
And they wonder why I never get high
I know, I know that I got it if I, do what I gotta do to get by
And they wonder why I never get high
And they wonder why I never get high

The original members of the Rattpack include:
C Dot Castro, Big Lenbo and Logic[Intro: Logic]
Woo, woo, yeah
Alright, here we go
Yeah yeah, yeah

[Verse 1: Logic]
Money on my mind, so I'm too paid
Real all the time, never Kool-Aid, sippin' on D'usse, sike
Came a long way from G'burg
Puttin' in work like Ferg
New York to L.A., Hawaii and Japan
I'm the motherfuckin' man, 'least I'm feelin' like I am
Got the whole wide world in the palm of my hand
But don't give a goddamn, I'm Sam-I-Am
What that even mean? I don't know what you talkin' 'bout
Why nowadays everybody got a palm out?
PLP, yeah that be me and that be what I rhyme 'bout
I have arrived, all you rappers are in timeout
RattPack, where you at? (Everywhere worldwide!)
I know you been waitin' for this world to collide
B. O. double B. Y., H. A. L. L., and Folarin
'Bout to take it back like Doc and Marty inside the DeLorean
I am no historian, but here to make my predecessors proud
All you bitch niggas not allowed?
I put it on everything, I really want a cop out
But I did good for a dropout
Hop out the coupe, chicken heads go crazy
Gotta sound swag when the flow get lazy
What up? What good? Where you at? What you been on?
Anybody steppin' to me, promise they get shit on
Better hop up on the train 'fore you miss the chance to
Hop up on thehop up on the train 'fore you miss the chance to get on
Mixtape Bobby, that's the type of shit I spit on
Woo!

[Chorus: John Lindahl & Logic]
And it's on now
Everybody know that it's on now (I'll be damned)
Get in the zone now
Ohh, no, no, no (I'll be damned)
I said it's on now
Everybody know that it's on now (I'll be damned)
Ohh, get in the zone now
Ohh, no, no, no

[Post-Chorus: Logic, John Lindahl and Wale]
Everybody alive, everybody alive
Everybody that's listening to this feelin' alive
Come on now feel the vibe, come on now feel the vibe
Come on now, come on now, come on now, you gotta survive
Everybody alive, everybody alive
Everybody that's listening to this feelin' alive
Come on now feel the vibe, come on now feel the vibe
Come on now, come on now, come on now, you gotta survive
I said you gotta survive, gotta survive
Gotta survive, I said you gotta survive
Gotta survive, gotta survive (Wale though)
Gotta survive, I said you gotta survive (Yeah, RattPack, Blue Moon)

[Verse 2: Wale]
Uh, smooth criminal, Mike Jack
Throw a subliminal, put your woman in black dress
They was in Timberlands, I was reppin' them Nike boots
'Member them nights that momma couldn't come right back
I'm on the path right now, put the plight on the mic
If I write mine down, I incite my crowd
I put Solbiato down (wholetime, wholetime!)
Used to go to Mark Twain, Mo County co-signed me
Got many flows that any ho would vouch for
I got many foes cause many hoes be out for
Had the Penny Foams, remember those was copper
Had so many homies talkin' 'bout, "How you got those?"
I'm Phil Knight in real life, I'm real Nike
It's flight club in my house, they not like me
More than likely they ain't got the heart to fight me
It's a lie, somebody seein' me needs some Visine, yeah
Let me let it breathe
Saint Laurent level, weather never worry me
I'm well aware they be wildin when they talkin' me
They bitches in the ballot but whenever I be on the scene, oh
Hammers in the Uber, I be limousine though
Diamonds lookin' fluke but I got the same glow
And I got a juice back around the way though
My chain like a penguin's Pellegrino (woo!)
We cold, we cold
Used to be in LakeForest with the Kobe fro
Eddie Bauer coat, Foams and a load of dope
Boat load of white hoes I sold it to nigga
I was tryna survive, tryna survive
I was tryna survive, yeah, yeah
I was tryna provide, I was tryna survive
I put it down every time
Got some niggas alive, I got some niggas that not
Pour a little of brown liquor and look in the sky
Been the talk of the town, nigga, Virginia, Maryland
Did it all for the capital, hope you haven't forgot
Hoes love me a lot, niggas hate me a lil
Anybody can hear me for real give me they props
Hookin' up with a couple models, nobody's gon' try to play us
The motto is get your paper and make you a lot
Pulling up with the Young Sinatra, I'm looking like Sammy Davis
The MGM or the Vegas to shake up the rocks
And the Stadium poppin', the Palladium poppin'
It's a fifty a place nigga, she thinkin' about it
I'll be damned

[Chorus: John Lindahl & Logic]
And it's on now
Everybody know that it's on now (I'll be damned)
Get in the zone now
Ohh, no, no, no (I'll be damned)
I said it's on now
Everybody know that it's on now (I'll be damned)
Ohh, get in the zone now
Ohh, no, no, no

[Post-Chorus: Logic & John Lindahl]
Everybody alive, everybody alive
Everybody that's listening to this feeling alive
Come on now feel the vibe, come on now feel the vibe
Come on now, come on now, come on now, you gotta survive
Everybody alive, everybody alive
Everybody that's listening to this feeling alive
Come on now feel the vibe, come on now feel the vibe
Come on now, come on now, come on now, you gotta survive
I said you gotta survive, gotta survive
Gotta survive, I said you gotta survive
Gotta survive, gotta survive
Gotta survive, I said you gotta survive

[Verse 3: Logic]
Uh, woo, goddammit, I'm back at it
Never out of breath like an asthmatic, I done had it
For this shit, I'm an addict, back in Maryland livin' in the attic
Flowin' erratic, bringin' the static, bustin' like an automatic
I'm badder than the baddest and madder than the maddest
My flow the fattest, hotter than a desert in Nevada
None of the badder, fuck all the chitter and chatter, none of it matter
Pull the trigger and listen to the pitter and patter, let 'em shatter
'Cause I'm rippin' and livin' and strivin', the killer
The Ripper, he callin', we'll go and he'll flow and you know
He pursuin' it, doin' it, movin' it, groovin' it, stoppin' it, rockin' it
Talkin' it, walkin' it, flippin' it, rippin' it, no, no, no, no, no, no, no!
Goddammit, I'm back at it
Never outta breath like an asthmatic, I done had it
For this shit, I'm an addict, back in Maryland livin' in the static
Flowin' erratic, bringin' the static, bustin' like an automatic
I'm badder than the baddest and madder than the maddest
My flow the fattest, hotter than a desert in Nevada
None of the badder, fuck all the chitter and chatter, none of it matter
Pull the trigger and listen for the pitter patter, let 'em shatter
I'm rippin' and livin' and strivin' the killer
The Ripper, he call and we'll go and he flow and you know
He pursuin' it, doin' it, movin' it, groovin' it, stoppin' it, rockin' it
Talkin' it, walkin' it, flippin' it, rippin' it, no motherfuckin' script, no
I'm rippin' and livin', strivin' the killer
Ripper, he callin', we'll go and he flow
Listen, rippin' and livin' and strivin' the killer, the-
Alright, we gon' do this one more time (Listen listen)
I'm rippin' and livin' and strivin', the killer
The Ripper, he call and we'll go and he flow and you know
He pursuin' it, doin' it, movin' it, groovin' it, stoppin' it, rockin' it, talkin' it, walkin' it
Flippin' it, rippin' it, no mother to fuck up his script, no, no, no, no, no, no, no!

[Interlude: Logic]
This what we gon' do right now
I'ma test my syllable ability, you know what I'm sayin'?
I like to call this shit my syllability
I've been sippin' on this tequila right now
This one of the last songs we recording for this motherfucker
So I'ma really gonna go off on y'all right now
We gon' do this shit in one breath, alright?
This ain't no bullshit, this ain't-, nah, nah, nah, nah
This ain't no editin', we gon' do it like this
Are y'all ready? (Yeah)
No, no, no, no, are y'all ready? (Yeah!)

[Verse 4: Logic]
I'm rippin' and livin' and strivin' to kill it
The Ripper, he'll call and we'll go and he flow and you know
He pursuin' it, doin' it, movin' it, groovin' it
Stoppin' it, rockin' it, talkin' it, walkin' it
Flippin' it, rippin' it
Like the motherfuckin' script and I'm ready to go
When I buy it then break it, roll it (Daaaaaamn!)
Then lick it and smoke it, choke on it later, yeah
Slicin' emcees like Darth Vader
Decapitate a hater the second I spit it

[Outro: Logic]
Say hell yeah (Hell yeah!)
Say hell yeah (Hell yeah!)
Say hell yeah (Hell yeah!)
Say hell yeah (Hell yeah!)
Say hell yeah[Chorus]
Take it back, take it way back
Take it way, way back to the first black man
Long ago before the white man
Could paint the black man with a gun in his hand
Take it back, take it way back
Take it way, way back to the first white man
At the very moment when they looked around and said
"Fuck it, Ima steal this land"
Take it back, take it way back
Take it way way back to the first black man
Long ago before the white man
Could paint the black man with a gun in his hand
Take it back, take it way back
Take it way, way back to the first white man
At the very moment when they looked around and said
"Fuck it, Ima steal this land"

[Verse 1]
Everybody wanna tell me what I am, what I am not
"You ain't black, you a mothafuckin' white boy
Shut ya mouth, do it right boy, a'ight boy?
Man, why you such a hype boy?"
"Why you always talk about being black?
Skin too white, nigga fuck that"
Everything you talk about, cut that
That door you trying to open, you could shut that
Grip the gat, yeah thats how Ima buck back
Tell me what I am and what I know now
All this prejudice has got to go
Life is moving fast, it need to slow down
Come and see me when I am in yo' town
Practice what we preach before it go down
Practice what we preach before it go
Yes, I got the gift to gab fo sho
Will I have to get the gat? No, no
Yes, I got to gift to gab fo sho
But will have to get the gat, get the gat, get the, get the?
Masta deep down inside of me
The plantation deep down inside of me
Everybody fuck like sodomy
'Cause one or the other what it gotta be
Tell me why my momma gotta lie to me
Unity for everyone that lied to me
Peace on Earth what I try to be
I just wanna spread the message of equality
And yes, I got to gift to gab fo sho
Will I have to get the gat? No, no
Yes, I got to gift to gab fo sho
But will have to get the gat, get the gat, get the, get the gat?

[Chorus]
Take it back, take it way back
Take it way, way back to the first black man
Long ago before the white man
Could paint the black man with a gun in his hand
Take it back, take it way back
Take it way, way back to the first white man
At the very moment when they looked around and said
"Fuck it, Ima steal this land"
Take it back, take it way back
Take it way way back to the first black man
Long ago before the white man
Could paint the black man with a gun in his hand
Take it back, take it way back
Take it way way back to the first white man
At the very moment when they looked around and said
"Fuck it, Ima steal this land"

[Outro]
Take it back, take it way back
Take it way, way back to about 1990
Shady Grove Hospital in Rockville, Maryland
7:36 a.m., where a biracial baby was born
To a black father and a white mother
Father that wasnt there
Addicted to crack cocaine, alcohol, and various other drugs
Same as his mom
(Way, way back)
So Im gonna tell you about that, right?
And Im gonna tell you about how
All this young boy ever wanted was happiness
All he ever wanted was positivity
All he ever wanted to do was entertain
And this boy went through hell
You gotta understand, his mother was racist, which is crazy
'Cause how in the fuck is you gonna have
All these black babies with black men but you racist
Like bitch, that dont make no sense, but it is what it is
You know, he grew up, her callin' him a nigger
The kids at school callin' him a cracker
Identifying as black, looking as white
Being told what you can or cant be
This kid went through everything
He went through...
He saw narcotics in the household
Violence, murderers, drug dealers, he was kidnapped
There was crazy shit that happened to this kid
And he persevered while the whole world said
What they said?
Said you wouldnt be shit!
You aint gon' be nothin', nothin', nothin', nothin'
Nothin', nothin', nothin', nothin', nothin', nothin', nothing
And I, and he, he said fuck that, Ima persevere
And thats why the message is always peace, love and positivity
See, he always saw things from two sides
He always saw things from two sides
He always knew that the message
Everybody was born equal
Regardless of race, religion, color, creed, and sexual orientation
He knew that because he saw that
(Take it back, take it way back
Take it way)
Because he was stripped and torn down
By his black brothers and sisters that were uneducated
And that did not know
And he was stripped and he was torn down
By his white side that did not know
These people that are ignorant
That cannot see the bigger picture
That must fight and kill and murder each other
But once again, all he ever wanted to do
Was spread a message of equality
For every man, woman, and child
Regardless of race, religion, color, creed, and sexual orientation
(Take it back, take it way back
Take it way, way back to the first)
Now imagine this child growing up
And seeing the craziest shit
Being a part of the craziest shit
Running around with the wrong people
Running around with guns and knives
And fighting and stealing and, and all this
Because he didnt know, he didnt know!
But he knew deep down in his heart that it wasnt right
And he knew that he needed to get away from it
Now I want you to also imagine, that at 17 years old
This child, okay, leaves home and gets two jobs to support himself
Two jobs that he works in the morning and the evenings
And then he would then come home
To about eight or nine hours of sleep
But spend four, five, six hours of that
Working on music, persevering
Grabbing the remote control and looking in the mirror
And pretending to see thousands and thousands and thousands of people
Just chanting his name
Hoping that it would happen
But the, but the, but the world said no!
Mothafucka, little mothafucka no-no, no-no, no-no, no-no
Ya nigga, ya cracka, ya white boy, ya black mothafucka
No-no!
(Take it back, take it way back
Take it way, way back to the first)
And he said fuck that
He said peace, love, and positivity
He said equality for all man
Regardless of race, religion, color, creed, and sexual orientation, yeah
Now I want you to also imagine
People telling him that he did not live this life
You just a white boy
You aint never experienced that shit
You from Gaithersburg, Maryland, nothing happens there
Oh no, no, we know, we werent there
We didnt live with you, we didn't live in your Section 8 household
We didnt live with the narcotics and violence in your household
We just saw it from the outside, outside, outside, outside
Outside, outside, outside, outside
And since you white, you gotta have money, right?
(Take it back, take it way back
Take it way, way back to the first black man)
And this young man persevered in spite
Of what people told him he was, wasnt, and would never be
(Take it back, take it way back
Take it way, way back to the first black)
And that man is here today, proud
A lover of all human beings
Regardless of race, religion, color, creed, sexual orientation, yeah, yeah
And hes here to say:
Even though were all born and created equal
We are not treated equally
Theres extremists on every side
And you should just do your best to live life
And let other people believe whatever they wanna believe
As long as theyre not hurtin' anybody
You can believe theyre going to hell
You can believe its not right
You can believe youre superior, fine
Just stop killing each other[Produced by 6ix and Logic]

[Intro]
Aye, this that shit
I'm looking at you 6ix
I've been feeling like a...

[Verse 1]
I've been feeling like a mothafuckin' postman
Sending letters to the people
All this knowledge that I got, I'm like an old man
Hold up, wait now oh man!
Let me back up in this bitch
I'm platinum in this bitch, I'm rapping in this bitch
Running the game, yeah I've been lappin' in this bitch
You know it's alright
Fuck around and they all might
Look at a brother different, I've been at it all night
I think I said it but I know I do it
This for everybody going through it

[Hook 1]
Like woah
Through it like woah
Through it like woah
Going through it like woah
You already know
You already know
Gotta get it like woah
In this bitch like woah
Get it like, like, like woah
Let's gouh, I'ma get it like woah

[Verse 2]
Back up in this mothafucka livin' like a goddamn king
Tell me money ain't a thing now
30 thousand feet above the world right next to the wing
Too high to hear the birds sing now
All around the world and back again it's finally happenin'
I'm lappin' in this luxury by nappin' in a big ass house
Chillin' with my homies on the West side, West side
Bringin' out my best side
I was on the road for like a quarter I was in and out the border
From London to Paris, yes it's very extraordinary
Fuck around and took the bus and a ferry
Should've seen the itinerary
Then we made it back home like woah
Tell me how you're feelin', higher than the ceilin'
I know I've been illin'
Probably wonder where I'm at, bitch I've been chillin'
Why they grillin'? Yeah I'm still in like I never left
They know I had to go but then I brought it right back

[Hook 2]
Like woah
Do it like woah
Do it like woah
Going through it like woah
You already know
You already know
Gotta get it like woah
In this bitch like woah
Get it like, like, like woah
Let's goUh, I'ma get it like woah

[Bridge]
I get so high they wonder why no I can't go away
I gotta hold my own, know that's the only way
I've been vibin', let me guide em, I said I gotta know
I've been ridin' for so long I think that it's time to go
Feeling like an addict that ain't had it, up and at it in a minute
If it hadn't been invented, my limit wouldn't be infinite
I'm feeling like an infant in a womb, I'ma be here 'til the tomb
Lately I've been in my room
Lookin' and lookin' at records on the wall
Hold up

[Outro]
Like woah

[Skit: Kevin Randolph (as Joseph Kai)]
Yeah I hope we make it to fuckin' paradise and not die on the way there, mothafucka...[Piano Intro]

[Verse 1]
I wonder what it feel like
To do that shit in real life
And now I know I got it
That's the reason No I.D. has signed me on the dotted
But it's still Visionary 'til the death of me
Yeah, I'm tryna make it but I gotta find the recipe
Greatest of all time, I want the world addressing me
At the hotel, these beautiful girls undressing me
I'm tryna stay focused, I guess that's the lord testing me
I knew as a child, that this was my destiny
They do it for the limelight
But I make sure my rhyme's right
Waiting till the time's right
Smiling at my mom's like
Smiling at my mom
Smiling at my mama
Mot what we sipping now
We was never tripping now
We on private jets, in other words, that means that we tripping now
'Cause they was over there, I was over here
They was too scared while I was facing my fears
I've always been driven, but they too scared to steer
That's why I compete with legends, motherfuck my peers

[Chorus]
I'm the man of the year, man of the year
Man of the year, man of the year
Man of the year, man of the year

[Verse 2]
They said I couldn't do it
Back when I was broke going through it
'Til I got a deal, now they talking 'bout "I knew it"
But you wasn't there in the beginning
Nowhere to be found when I was down
But you show up when I'm winning
Uh, left me to drown, now I'm swimming
I do it 'cause I love this shit
Fuck the money, and the women, and the-
And the whips with the rims still spinning
I been at it since the beginning
All these girls screaming, "Logic"
But I wanna hear my real name
Come from the lips of a beautiful woman, that's real man
Y'all act like I'm Superman
But I can feel pain
I shoulda gone crazy, and yet I'm still sane
Love it when they sing to us
Been shining what's bling to us
Yeah, over here
It's only been a year
I was dirt broke, now I'm balling like a sphere

[Chorus]
I'm the man of the year, man of the year
Man of the year, man of the year
Man of the year, man of the year

[Verse 3]
Now that I'm in the limelight
They hit me all the time like (Logic, you never call me!)
Shut the fuck up, ho
Let me get my mind right
'Cause this is for the fans
Who truly understand
Real all the time
All of y'all my fam
Shooting for the stars
And I ain't finna land
Giving everything I can
While they tell me I'm the man
Making music is the plan
Matter fact, you can call it plan B
'Cause I kill these rappers while they're in their infancy
And I be first to pop off -  infantry
Gotta keep 'em in line like symmetry
We all fam, same root, smokin' different tree
And all these people in the crowd sound like a symphony
Uh, to my ears
I love it when they cheer
On the road to success, these haters in my rear
I got nothing to fear
'Cause the whole team here
And everybody shouting (What they shouting?)

[Chorus]
You're the man of the year, man of the year
Man of the year, man of the year
Man of the year, man of the year[Intro]
Lemme shout out Bobby cause, 6ix in there like

[Verse 1]
Call me Bobby Tarantino living on the level
And I'm prophesizing everything we know
Because of the internet, I made a million and another million
That's word to Gambino
He one of the realest, I swear he the realest
But anyway, back to the subject at hand
I just performed for an hour, performed for an hour
And made myself a hundred grand like...

No, it's never made up, no, it's, no, it's straight up!
Straight up, bitch!

[Chorus]
I'm like, oh my goodness, oh my goodness

[Verse 3]
Yeah, it's that Flexicution, I want retribution
Y'all gone fuck around and make me wake up Lucian
And I don't think y'all ready for the revolution
Boy your shit is pollution, Logic got the solution
Motherfuckers used to hate us, now they sayin' that they made us
Everyone know I'm the greatest
Tell 'em, "Title your album, A Fish Outta Water"
Cause that shit be floppin'You fuckin' suck...
Number 1 my shit droppin', love it or hate it, they know the name
They know the name cause it's poppin'
Dropped 2 million on my new crib
Now nobody but God can stop us!

[Outro]
Oh my goodness, oh my goodness, oh my goodness
Oh my goodness, oh my God

Oh my goodness, oh my goodness
Oh my goodness, oh my God
Fuck, Jurassic Park... lit[Intro: Lucy Rose]
Everything is fine, everything is so fine
Everything is fine, everything is so fine
'Cause Im good, so good

[Chorus]

[Verse 1]
Ima make it some day some how what you telling yourself
But you aint focused on what's important: mentality, health Everybody in the world only want one thing, what's that?
Infinite power and a pocket full of wealth
Its like ohhh I'ma bring it back to the basics
Nobody can erase it
People in the street going ape shit
Battling depression but nobody wanna say shit
I'ma bring it back to the basics
I'ma bring it back to the basics
I'ma get up, get on
Thats what I been on
Fuckin' with your mind, tryna turn shit on
But they want to paint me as a villain
Even though Im here to open their mind
Through the rhyme of life
I gotta open their mind and design the right time
To make a decision and get in 'em like an incision
'Cause I'ma hit 'em and give 'em livin'
They wonder what Im giving, I'ma never give in
I gotta let everybody know
I'm in their mind right now

[Chorus]
Ima get up in your mind right now
Make you feel like dying right now
Ima make you pray to God
To the good old Lord for a sign right now
To the good old Lord
Ima get up in your mind right now
Make you feel like dying right now
Ima make you pray to God
To the good old Lord for a sign right now
To the good old Lord

[Verse 2]
I'ma bring it back to the basics
Nobody can erase it
People in the street going ape shit
Battling depression but nobody wanna say shit
Why nobody wanna say:
I been living with this everyday
Why nobody wanna say:
Everything will be ok
I'ma bring it back to the basics
Everything will be okay
I remember somehow, someway
I remember somehow, someway
I remember somehow, someway
I remember somehow, someway

[Speech]
It was December of 2015 in sunny Los Angeles California in the heart of Hollywood
I stood next to my wife in a line surrounded by hundreds of other people on our way to watch Star Wars
When suddenly I was engulfed with fear and panic
As my body began to fade
In this moment my mind was full of clarity
But my body insisted it was in danger
I looked around and I told myself I was safe, I was fine
But I was convinced that something was wrong
Before I knew it I felt as though I was going to
Fall and fade away
My body grew weak
And soon enough I found myself in a hospital bed being told what I went through was anxiety
I refused to believe this story
I searched and searched for the cause of what had happened to me
I began to feel detached from reality
I felt as though I was seeing the world through a glass
I got blood work done
Analysis of my mind and body to no avail
The doctor said it was anxiety
But how could it be anxiety?
How could anxiety make me physically feel off balance?
How could anxiety make me feel as though I was fading from this world and on the brink of death?
Derealization
The sense of being out of ones body
Im not here
Im not me
Im not real
Nothing is
Nothing but this feeling of panic
Nobody understands
Nobody knows the sufferings
This physical feeling
It cant be anxiety
It cant
Or can it?
Can it in fact be the mind controlling the body?
Yeah, of course
Im so in control of my mind and my body
But Im subconsciously forcing myself into a state
Of self bondage entangled by the ropes of my own mind
I am unhappy
Not with life
But with this feeling
I am scared, I am human, I am a man
But I look in the mirror and I see a child
I am an adult who recognize grown ups dont really know shit
And they never did
And it scares me
Cause now Im just a grown up who doesnt know shit
But one thing is I do know this feeling, this horrible feeling is going to kill me
No, no this feeling
This anxiety is nothing
I have anxiety
Just like you, the person I wrote this for
And together we will overcome this feeling
We will remember despite the attacks and constant feeling of our mind and body being on the edge
That we are alive
And any moments we have free of this feeling we will not take for granted
We will rejoice in this gift that is life
We will rejoice in this day that we have been given
We will accept our anxiety and strive for the betterment of ourselves
Starting with mental health
We will accept ourselves as we are
And we will be happy with the person we see in the mirror
We will accept ourselves
And live with anxiety[Verse 1]
I know that you think this song is for you
I used to long for you and adore you
My life was just fine way back before you
Now when you reach out I just ignore you

[Hook]
'Cause this ain't a love song (Whoa)
This is, "So long"
You did me so wrong for so long
For so long, for so long

[Verse 2]
No, I never thought I could live my life without you
All you ever seem to do is scream and make it all about you

[Refrain]
And so I doubt you
I doubt you even know what's on my mind
I said, I doubt you
I doubt you even know why I left you behind

[Interlude]
I know that I've been living
I know that I've been living
I know that I've been living
I know that I've been living
In the city of stars, where there's flying cars
A brand new home for everyone and even life on Mars
In the city of stars, where there's flying cars
A brand new home for everyone and even life on Mars

[Hook]
This ain't a love song (Whoa)
This is, "So long"
You did me so wrong for so long
For so long, for so long

[Refrain]
And so I doubt you
I doubt you even know what's on my mind
I said I doubt you
I doubt you even know why I left you

[Verse 3]
Yeah, uh, yeah
Much love to Def Jam, even though they under shipped me
Did me like Bobby did Whitney, but the fans was with me
Know my name around the world but it still ain't hit me
All the talent in the world and they still don't get me
I didn't talk about my race on the whole first album
But black vs. white bullshit was the still the outcome
How come these motherfuckers can't seem to let it go?
Judging rap by race instead of the better flow
Who gives a fuck who made it? I penetrate it and innovate it
While they emulate it, give a fuck if I'm hated
I'ma do it 'til I get it, fuck a nominated
Bitch, I dominate it
Yeah, emails from Rick Rubin, dinner with No ID
Chilling with B-I-G D-A-Double-D-Y K-A-N-E
Not many get to do what I do, and now enemies
Thinking they slick as fuck like the finna befriending me
But let's get back to the music, I'm gone
Outside of this solar system, I'm searching for paradise
Livin' the life, bitch, I've been a vet
Fuck all these cats on the internet
I love hip-hop and I hate hip-hop
'Cause people that love Pac hope that Drake get shot
'Cause he raps about money and bitches, for heaven's sakes
Pac did the same shit, just on a drum break
Now, I ain't wanna name names, I'm just droppin' this game
We all people, all equalnow let me let off, yeah
Now let me let off
Tougher than raw denim, my flow you can't identify
Talib said it best back in the day, we just tryna get by
Two words, Mos Def, in my headphones
Black on one side, now I'm in another zone
Switch flows, fuck 'em upplay the game, run 'em up
Yeah, I sold a couple records but people don't give a fuck
All the people want is real, guess that's why Logic appeal
All the power in the world; hold that, tell me how that feel?
Racism on television and magazines
Paying taxes so soldiers don't run out of magazines, god damn
Country don't give a fuck who I am
Just a youngin' on the rise with a mic in my hand
And I am, here's to the Roc
The .45 Glock that my older brother popshot
And I am, finally on top; too high up, not a drop
Stop, we gettin' guap, gettin' guap
I am, livin' like I ain't got it
Spit the flow so robotic, man, who gives a fuck about it?
Maryland 'til I die, but I had to get the fuck up out it
I love it and hate it, you probably don't know, man, I doubt it[Verse 1]
Me and my team gotta intervene
What's the point of living if you ain't living a dream?
We live in a world where everybody want everything
Everybody want a better thing
Tryna fool ya like it's picture perfect but it's just the editing
Man, the game been waiting for a better king
I've been posted with my Queen like Coretta King
Screaming "Money ain't a thing", cause it ain't
Man, I never knew that living out a dream
Meant living out a suitcase, I've been working at a new pace
So much money on the road I ain't even had a minute
Not a single second chilling in my new place
Motherfuckers getting two-faced
Cause a brother finally eating
Not to mention everybody gettin' two plates
You know I only got two traits
Drop hits, get moneyrun it

[Verse 2]
What the fuck is there left to talk about
I told them my vision, let 'em know what it's all about
Industry only respect me because I'm ballin' out
You never know who there for you until you fallin' out
And that's the reason I've been in the kitchen
Working on that nutrition, now let 'em listen
Boy, this been my house, this is merely an addition
Fuck 'em and their permission, they was killin' the game
Who the one that gave 'em remission?you know the name
Who else you know on the come up, do it like I does it
Lyrics all up in your skull like when the barber buzz it
Say my last shit a classic, and I wonder was it?
Come to think about it everybody seemed to love it
I was workin' on a budget, second time around shit is different
Cause they know that boy good, know he does it
I've been at it for the people that been lovin' my shit
Not the people that been hating
They can suck my dickrun it

[Interlude]
I'ma do somethin' different for the last one
I'ma go in...

[Verse 3]
Feelin' like Matthew Mcconaughey
On an Interstellar mission in Chicago
At the bottom of the Riviera
I wonder who I would be if I wasn't in my era
I gotta beware of the people
But I take care of the people
When I jump in the cockpit and rock it
Been done had this in my pocket
I had to wait to unlock it
Open that locket and see the picture I painted
No, we ain't never acquainted
On the rise like a defendant
That was charged with possession like an exorcism
My division is solely my vision
God damn, can you feel it?
Uh, I had a dream I would run the game and kill it
Had a dream, can you feel it?
Motherfucker wanna push it to the limit
Get up in it, make the shit infinite
Yeah you know I wanna win it, on my independent
I've been at it like an addict
Never at the party like I'm democratic
'Lotta static on the radio
Fuck everything that they represent
This right here is heaven sent, never irrelevant
No never when I slide up in the spot
Just a youngin' in the game
Tryna show 'em what I got, way back
That was the mentality, never truly reality
Looking for validation
With all the wrong things on my mind for motivation
Just chillin' at the crib on a Playstation
'Cause I never thought about it, never thought that people would have a song like mine in their rotation
Til I wised up, got 'em sized up
Ready to go, I'm feelin' fired up
Man it's been a good ride up
Everybody want me to lace 'em
I'm too tied up, this a ransom
Fist full of money then we head back to the mansion
30 thousand people in the crowd, we expanding
Couple years back you ain't give a damn
Autographs off the plane whenever I land
All part of the plan, anything you wanna do you can
Just go and get it, fuck 'em if they don't love 'em
Be above it unless you're thinking your profession gon' be rap
Matter fact, you should take a step backcause I run it[Chorus]
Ass, titties, pussy, money, weed
Everywhere I look a killing spree
All the things they wanted me to be
Is all the things that I turned out to be
Ass, titties, pussy, money, weed
Everywhere I look a killing spree
All the things they wanted me to be
Is everything that I like, like, like, like
Ass, titties, pussy, money, weed
Everywhere I look a killing spree
All the things they wanted me to be
Is all the things that I turned out to be
Ass, titties, pussy, money, weed
Everywhere I look a killing spree
All the things they wanted me to be
Is everything that I like, like, like, like

[Verse 1]
Real shit goin' on in Lebanon
But I dont give a fuck, my favorite show is coming on
Hashtag pray for this, pray for that
But you aint doing shit, get away from that
Blame it on a black, blame it on a white
Blame it on a gun, blame it on a Muslim
Everybody wanna blame him, blame her
Just blame it on a mothafucka killing everyone!
Everybody wanna get high
Everybody wanna live life like they cant die
Everybody gotta be right
Everybody scrollin', scrollin' through they life
I wish they would love me like I like they pictures
I wish I had bitches
I wish I had motivation to get money
Aint it funny, my rainy day would be sunny
If I had the vision of currency fallin' above from the sky
Fallin' above from the sky, listen up
Everybody looking for the meaning of life through a cell phone screen
Everybody looking for the meaning of life through a cell phone screen
Everybody think that the meaning of life is, life is
Everybody, everybody, woo
Everybody think that the meaning of life is

[Chorus]
Ass, titties, pussy, money, weed
Everywhere I look a killing spree
All the things they wanted me to be
Is all the things that I turned out to be
Ass, titties, pussy, money, weed
Everywhere I look a killing spree
All the things they wanted me to be
Is everything that I like, like, like, like
Ass, titties, pussy, money, weed
Everywhere I look a killing spree
All the things they wanted me to be
Is all the things that I turned out to be
Ass, titties, pussy, money, weed
Everywhere I look a killing spree
All the things they wanted me to be
Is everything that I like, like, like, like

[Verse 2: Ansel Elgort]
Oh, I know its hard, I know its hard like
I know thats the reason you turn up at night
Livin' yo' life, just livin' yo' life
Cant nobody tell you how to do it right
Come away with me, come away with me
Let me take you from this world of insanity
Come away with me, come away with me
Far away from flying bullets on this killing spree
Oh, I know, I know
Its hard, yeah, its hard, yeah, yeah
I know its hard sometimes
Its hard sometimes

[Chorus]
Ass, titties, pussy, money, weed
Everywhere I look a killing spree
All the things they wanted me to be
Is all the things that I turned out to be
Ass, titties, pussy, money, weed
Everywhere I look a killing spree
All the things they wanted me to be
Is everything that I like, like, like, like[Intro]
Youyou, you
Youyou, you, you, you, you
You, youyou
Youyou, you, you, you, you
Youyou, you, you, you, you

Warm it up, warm it up, warm it up
Warm it up, warm it up

[Verse 1: Young Sinatra]
It's that Young Sinatra shit, yeah, that's that Young Sinatra shit
Shut the fuck up and listen whenever Young Sinatra spit
Yeah, your girl fine as hell but she a Young Sinatra chick
Hey Bobby, how can you tell? She on the Young Sinatra dick
All these rappers wack as fuck, make the Young Sinatra sick
RattPack be the squad, that's that Young Sinatra clique
Goddamn, said this the Young Sinatra clique, goddamn!
Listen, yeahIm visualizing the realism of life in actuality
Step to me, fatality; yeah, this shit is my galaxy
I am who the baddest be, I'd rather be at the academy
Killers, I'm be glad to be me, magnify the shit like bifocal
Motherfuckers talk on the internet, but in person they never vocal
Come to the hood and fuck you up if you prefer to be local
I'm loco from Noho to Soho
Gettin' cheese like a photo, you know, ho
I'm blessed like Sunday, flyer than a runway
Lil' Bobby never second-guessed that he gon' make it one day
Oneway or another, my brother, word to your mother
They should give me a badge 'cause I'm always under covers
Goddamn! I'm a miraculous man!
You know I get, I get it, I get it, I get it
The Young Sinatra spit it, rewind it, and rip it
I could murder your whole album with a 30-second snippet
Pass the Mary Jane like I'm runnin' a train with Peter Parker
On tour, I have more sex in the city than Sarah Jessica Parker
The deeper and deeper I go, it get darker
They say they want the old me, they want the Young Sinatra back
The one that murder it, rip it up, no, never givin' up 'round the almanac
Yeah, I'm all of that, fall back, like September again
Bashin' these rappers so hard they won't remember again
When it comes to hip-hop, bitch, I'm indigenous to this
It's apparent I'm bearin' down like a parent
When the beef is at stake, I'm Mastro's
My god-level lyricism surpass flows, I'm much more than fast flows
Money, talk, cash knows, greatest of levelsI've passed those

[Chorus: Bobby Tarantino]
Fuck that rap shit, this that trap shit (Bobby!)
This world is my contraption (Bobby!)
I was born and raised in the trap, son (Bobby!)
Talk shit, get kidnapped, son (Bobby!)
I don't really know why I rap, son (ay!)
Money in the bank, yeah, I got some (ay!)
Couple sports cars, yeah, I bought some (ay!)
Logic never flex, Bobby get it done! (ay!)
Yeah, y'all don't really know where I come from (come now)
Talkin' that shit, I'ma come for 'em (what's good?)
Tell me what you really know about me right now
Anything I want, I get it somehow

[Verse 2: Young Sinatra]
Fuck that trap shit, this that rap shit
Give me the head like John the Baptist
Ready to rip it, I hope in the captives
Greatest alive like I'm Cassius
I put 'em all in they caskets, they can't seem to get past it
I'm a bastard that mastered the flow
And none of y'all ready for the massacre, though
Fuck with Logic? Yeah, that's a no
Matter of fact, it's not impossible, just highly improbable
Like, saying the police isn't robbable
But I'm liable to walk up in the station in blue-face
Like, "Fuck the police!"Blue lives ain't a race
Fuck whoever said this rap shit was never a race
This shit a marathon
Murder you motherfuckers and carry on
Claimin' that you really 'bout this shit
You got your Jim Carrey on
Liar Liar; I might crucify ya
Number one till I die, will never retire
I am the Messiah, I am the god of this shit
This is how we do ityeah, I started this shit
Yes, I started this shit like

[Chorus: Bobby Tarantino]
Fuck that rap shit, this that trap shit (Bobby!)
This world is my contraption (Bobby!)
I was born and raised in the trap, son (Bobby!)
Talk shit, get kidnapped, son (Bobby!)
I don't really know why I rap, son (ay!)
Money in the bank, yeah, I got some (ay!)
Couple sports cars, yeah, I bought some (ay!)
Logic never flex, Bobby get it done! (ay!)
Yeah, y'all don't really know where I come from (come now)
Talkin' that shit, I'ma come for 'em (what's good?)
Tell me what you really know about me right now
Anything I want, I get it somehow

[Outro]
Youyou, you
Youyou, you, you, you, you
You, youyou
Youyou, you, you, you, you
Youyou, you, you, you, you
You, youyou
Youyou, you, you, you, you[Intro + background]
En garde, I'll let you try my Wu-Tang style
I'd like to try your Wu-Tang style, let's begin, then
Shaolin shadowboxing and the Wu-Tang sword style
If what you say is true, the Shaolin and the Wu-Tang could be dangerous
Do you think your Wu-Tang sword can defeat me?
Wu-Tang!
Wu-Tang!
Wu-Tang!
Wu-Tang!

[Verse 1: Logic]
Ayo, ayo, Wu-Tang forever, who rhyme better?
We too clever, the boom bap's back, harder than ever
R.I.P. O.D.B, comin' through like Killa Bee
Ever since I heard Enter the 36 in '93
You cannot defeat my Wu-Tang style, I leave 'em all dismembered
Fuck a mumble rap, that shit won't never be remembered
Not even a contender, no, pretender, best surrender
My agenda is killin' shit, they feelin' this (Sinatra)
Yeah, we live and thorough
Assassinatin' every single muthafuckin' borough
From Staten to Brooklyn to Queens, the Bronx and Harlem
All the way to Maryland, yeah, we comin' for all 'em
Bobby Tarantino to the Digital
My shit is pivotal, smokin' chronic, no medicinal
Who you know assemble the Clan like Voltron?
The one and only Logic, the God, the don, I'm gone

[Break: Ghostface Killah]
Ay-yo, Logic, what up?
We gon' let these muthafuckas try this Wu-Tang style

[Verse 2: Ghostface Killah]
Yo, yo, yo, yo, kaboom!
Guess who stepped in the room
It's Ghostface, gold plates, old truths, more cake
Intelligent brothers with nine hoods, movin' snowflakes
Guillotine your head, last scene in the showcase
Push weight, this Colgate, tre-eights and old gates
Exfoliate those we most hate, we don't associate
We wear robes that you can't even pronunciate
We eat foods where you can't even pronounce you ate
Cribs where the floor just rises up and rotates
Locations low-key, can't even locate
Twin nina sisters with the beam, we all soulmates
Team makin' us so much cream, we bought gold plates

[Verse 3: Raekwon]
Yo, mountains of haze in the crib of my blades
It gets messy underneath the dresser, the gauge
57 MB, yo, metallic green, seats is piped off
Seize 'em old tracks, unite through 'em
The kitchen is my palace, get your dance on
While we just levitate with trees, get your branch on
I'm known to wil out, put the cams on
Jewels down, the sets dip, my gems got grams on
A specialist when I'm bakin'
Rhymes be comin' out, we makin'
We challengin' these chumps for lumps
Here's the statementstop hatin'
The crew is all about gettin' this cake in
You know about me, you relatin'

[Verse 4: RZA]
The enigma, the stigmas that the RZA and the GZA
Both lyrical prolific, fixtures of rap scriptures
Mixtures of hipsters, weed smokers, and beer drinkers
Prince and the Pauper, spiritual clear-thinkers
Cake in the oven, Superbad like McLovin
Huggin' all four boroughs, puffin' herb with my cousin
Academically speaking, rap vocabulary's weakenin'
I felt it comin' like The Weeknd when these starboys start tweakin'
Sporadic pill-poppin' of OxyContin
III-gotten sexual intercourse make shorty wop feel rotten
The travesty-tapestry of microphone mastery has been refuted
Diluted, broken down to a catastrophe
But cats still get the trophy, hit y'all with that "Okie-dokie"
Burt Reynolds, Bandit, goddamnit
Where the fuck is Smokey Bear when you need one?
I got a light-beam gun
I'll blast a hole in your chest that you can't bleed from
But you'll die through iniquity, plus stupidity of that trickery
My verse got it hot up in here, not the humidity
You can never get rid of me, step back and consider me
Wu Killa Bee, but I'm not big on bigotry

[Verse 5: Method Man]
Old school on this track, I feel invincible
This new school ain't really got rules and lack the principles
Got more clowns than the Motown, they puttin' critical
The gun, Smokey Robinson, you need a Miracle
Go back, homie, back when rappers used to be lyrical
When nine out of ten of his friends used to be criminals
The stats, homie, all these killas usin' subliminals
Y'all don't even smile in your pictures, you dudes is miserable
Witty unpredictable torture over your physical
Struggle bar, used to pour water over the cereal
Another bar, reppin' my squad, not individual
But one Nation under God, that's indivisible
My time critical, hands off I'm digital
Me and my Ladybug, back when the planet was Digable
I'm cool like that, my cash rule like that
I'm classic, Patti LaBelle, Voulez Vous like that, come on

[Verse 6: Inspectah Deck]
It's only Logic, we got 'em mobbin' in the mosh pit
Fifth Brother, INS hotter than the tropics
The hot shit I drop quick
Major player, watch my stock lift
Razor-blade sharpness regardless to whom or what
Sound boy, turn that music up
Naysayer, you ain't even got a clue what's up
Deadly melody, the sickness, the remedy
Everything circulate back around eventually
Witty unpredictable, talent all-natural
Gain, Wu-Tang pumpin' through your veins
Twenty-five years, still more of the same
The flow like water with the boilin' flame
INS, your highness, they callin' my name
Boy, I wet the scene similar to fallin' rain
In our own lane, y'all soundin' all the same
Tell 'em Wu-Tang is on your brain

[Verse 7: Cappadonna]
Survival of the fittest be cold days with no money
They don't want me with stacks, they better take it from me
You know the currency gone soon as you break a twenty
So I ain't down if you ain't talkin' that band language
Dear Lord, I'm tryna buy me a train with it
An airplane, see me flyin' to Spain with it
But money don't make me, and I ain't gonna change with it
I'm in the hood, lookin' good, the way I came with it
Do it for the Cs, they understood the game with it
We gave birth when we understood the pain with it
When we create wars, everybody is a gangbanger
We killin' each other, but we all got the same anger
Never go against the grain, homie, that's hateful
Another day in the life for us to be grateful
Spread love, homie, yeah, get a plateful
It's better to stay full, so let's make moves
I know your momma told you that I was a great dude
These dirty-ass cops, they kill and rape you
On some Jason shit, might Crystal in the Lake you
What? What, what? They might Crystal in the Lake you

[Verse 8: Jackpot Scotty Wotty]
Boom bap blast'll blow your sleeves off
Our Flashback Jacks are somethin' to feed off
Smoke and roast ya, the No. 9 Potion
Pull that shit, son, we open the ocean
Who gives a fuck who's snortin' and drinkin' and smokin'?
You get killed for jokin', everybody's hopin'
That's another level of emotion
Food stamps niggas doin' grocery
Police wanna grope me
Perp walk, then nigga street-talk
We bury niggas in sea salt
I carry the torch where I leave off
I'm givin' bitches somethin' to breathe on
I rip off a shoulder to lean on
It's fair game, it's two in a lane, she took two trains
And none of my rhymes are two and the same
Nigga get cooked on a open flame
I'm a hillbilly, Park Hill-trained

[Verse 9: U-God]
My rhyme starts riots in the mountains
Thirty-six million and countin'
The harder they come, the harder I go
Loosen up my arms, can I get comfortable?
Stay on my tip-toes, old-school Wu beat
This is a flip-phone, dude, your slips showin'
Where I come from it stays snowin'
The grammar is raw, I'm slammin' the door
Beez bang bong in your jaw
I hit 'em in the head with the hammer of Thor
Stars and bars, makes me a general
Anything less, makes me a criminal
Gotta dig deep for these Wu-Tang minerals

[Verse 10: Masta Killa]
G.O.D., shadowbox with the L.O.G.I.C
On the count of three, Wu-Tang
First, master your breathin'
I'm mental ass-whoopin', I'm teachin' when I'm speakin'
I'm a champion from Brooklyn
I'm movin' super-ninjas and Shaolin executioners
Avenger, a righteous defender
Grandmaster from the 36th Chamber
Toad style is mentally strong, so strengthen your arms
To hold my microphone you need iron palms
Remain calm, Jamel Irief
Wise chief, Wu-Tang poison clansman from the east, yeah

[Verse 11: GZA]
Enter a world of a universal mind of one kind
A thick swarm of words that's expressed in one rhyme
Food for thought, impossible sliders with the seasoning Regardless, I speak logicclear reasoning
The uncivilized, get the mineral lines, quartz
Self-directed, calculated, controlled thoughts
A point-of-view of the thinkers
Monumental architecture, amazing as the Incas

[Break: Cappadonna]
(Sinatra) (Wu-Tang)
W.T.C., ah-ha
The faculty
Ain't nothin' goin' on, don't nothin' move
Nobody slide, nobody get hurt

[Outro]
En garde, I'll let you try my Wu tang style
I'd like to try your Wu tang style, let's begin, then
Shaolin shadowboxing and the Wu tang sword style
If what you say is true, the Shaolin and the Wu Tang could be dangerous
Do you think your Wu Tang sword can defeat me?[Verse 1]
Living life like this is so crazy, this world is amazing
One day you're on top and the next she having your baby
Living life like this I get down, uh, when they come around, uh
I do my best to fall back and not, not make a sound
Feel like my mind gone but I'm still here
Don't fuck around cause they kill here
This music, it kill fear
I use it, when I need to hear
Been there, done that
Drop the shit, they gon' run it back
Simple shit, man I'm done with that
Fake rap, take it back
My chain heavy, got a lot of money
My bitch bad, have fun with that
I've been there and don't want it back
If I see the bitch I might run it back

[Chorus]
Cause I'm gone, so long, I'm gone, so long
I'm gone, so long, I'm gone, so long, I'm gone
Drink, smoke, vibe, fuck, chill, drive, talk, think about it
Drink, smoke, vibe, fuck, chill, drive, talk, think about it

[Verse 2]
So what now? (So what now?)
Let's get downlet's get drowned, on this vision
My division is the greatest that's around
Feel the vibe (feel the vibe)
This is where I'ma be for as long as I'm alive
I could vibe with this, fuck around and die for this
But would you ride for this? Better ride, no lie for this
They say "what's your motivation?"
Cutting these records like back in the basement
Boy, fuck a vacation
We do this for love, not no validation

[Pre-Chorus]
Living like this is so crazy, this world is amazing
One day you're on top and the next she having your baby
Living life like this I get down, uh, when they come around, uh
I do my best to fall back and not, not make a sound

[Chorus]
I'm gone, so long, I'm gone, so long
I'm gone, so long, I'm gone, so long, I'm gone
Drink, smoke, vibe, fuck, chill, drive, talk, think about it
Drink, smoke, vibe, fuck, chill, drive, talk, think about it

[Verse 3]
Wanna get it like this
(I think so) when I'm driving
(I drink slow) when I'm vibing
(You never know, know, know, know) (Lets go!)
I got it, posted up at the crib with something exotic
I don't smoke but she love to smoke
And look good as fuck when she light it
When she ride it, it's crazy, love when I get inside it
Baby stop tryna hide it, if the feeling's there then abide it
Baby girl, where you been? I don't know
I feel like this is the moment, I mean it feel like it don't it?
Shit girl I know that you want itbut fuck all that
Take the time to get down, stop all that running around
I'm feeling you feeling me, know that you into me
Baby girl let me get down, cause my mind gone
That's the type of shit that I'm on
Grip the mic and I go (Whoo!)
Fuck around with this flow (I know)

[Pre-Chorus]
Living like this is so crazy, this world is amazing
One day you're on top and the next she having your baby
Living life like this I get down, uh, when they come around, uh
I do my best to fall back and not, not make a sound

[Chorus]
I'm gone, so long, I'm gone, so long
I'm gone, so long, I'm gone, so long, I'm gone
Drink, smoke, vibe, fuck, chill, drive, talk, think about it
Drink, smoke, vibe, fuck, chill, drive, talk, think about it

[Outro: Thalia]
Making a single before your album is like putting together a trailer for a movie you have yet to shoot[Chorus: Logic]
Yeah, I've been killin' this shit

[Verse 1: Logic & (Pusha T)]
Let me tell you 'bout the young man
Matter of fact, I'ma let Push tell that
Tell you 'bout the old man
Had a change of heart and then fell back
Old man lived a long life
Walked around with a long knife
You ain't cut the white like Jesus
That Colombiana, that's mi hermanos (YUGH)
Look at the flick of that wrist
I'm feelin' like Leonardo
Let me paint a picture, I might need a bottle
On the road to success, I could feel the throttle
That Michelangelo, hundreds in the envelope
Tight shit when I write shit
And that old man had a change of heart
Wish he knew it back from the start like goddamn
Looked around, seen his wife on the ground
Military bussin' bullets all over the whole compound
Soon as he seen it, I swear it, I mean it, my members go quicker than vamonos
He dead, she dead, he in jail
Everyone fallin' like dominoes

[Chorus: Logic]
Yeah, I've been killin' this shit
Yeah, I've been hard in the paint, not a single assist
Yeah, I've been flickin' that wrist
Yeah, I've been cookin' that shit, now they fuckin' with this
Yeah, I've been killin' this shit
Yeah, I've been hard in the paint, not a single assist
Yeah, I've been flickin' that wrist
Yeah, I've been cookin' that shit, now they fuckin' with this
Yeah, I've been, yeah I've been killin' this, killin' this shit
Yeah, I've been flickin' that, flickin' that wrist

Yeah, I've hard in the paint, not a single assist
Yeah, I've flickin' that wrist
Yeah, I've cookin' that shit, now they fuckin' with this

[Verse 2: Pusha T]
Simple logic
Clockwise, counterclockwise, realest nigga in the top five
Other four ain't rap niggas, I'm just reppin' for the blow side
Yuugh, that's coastlines, Panama for the boat rides
Worth billions, and we ain't even need Showtime
Just money counters and kitchenwear
Condo with a bitch in there
Two scales and baggies, we got rich in there, woo!
The Rollie's been the trophy since Hawaiian Sophie
Curry over Kobe, we shootin' niggas
Splash brothers with the coca, add in baking soda
Goodfellas to my niggas (Yuugh) all Ray Liottas
Shades of blue, I aim at you
Let the sky fall, let it rain on you

[Chorus: Logic]
Yeah, I've been killin' this shit
Yeah, I've been hard in the paint, not a single assist

Yeah, yeah, SlayDro!
This that J Dilla right here
Badu, Indica Badu
Yeah, that's right...

[Verse 1: Logic]
Riding 'round the city with my homies, blowing trees
Wavy like the Seven Seas, living life, let me get it right
Let me give it a minute to get up in it like a beautiful independent woman that's finna make you wait to smash
Come now, let me count this cash
Come now, let me sip this flask
Pockets fat like shawty ass
Jump in the whip, gotta get this gas
Put that shit in drive, I'm live like ammunition
No permission needed, I proceeded to accelerate
Had days with hella hate, but gotta let that anger migrate
All this shit that's on my plate
That food for thought that can't be bought
But only taught, and on the real, know

[Chorus: Logic]
I can't get much higher, been smoking that fire
Riding 'round the city with my homies that know me
Know that I can't get much higher, word to my supplier
While you break it, roll it, light it, use that fire, ignite it
I can't get much higher, been smoking that fire
Riding 'round the city with my homies that know me
Know that I can't get much higher, word to my supplier
While you break it, roll it, light it, use that fire, ignite it
I can't get much higher

[Verse 2: Wiz Khalifa]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Nigga, like we smoking all weekend
And I roll and smoke when I'm drinkin'
Tell them open that door but don't peek in
We be havin' a OG Kush meetin'
If we smokin' that dope, it's a reason
Eyes so low from the chiefin'
I be getting high when I wake up
And roll me one more 'fore I'm sleeping
Man, I be smoking so good that I be forgetting the past
It don't even come to my house
If it ain't wrapped up in a turkey bag
We roll up the herb and laugh, kick back, blow a zip
Take it on a plane, know I smoke the same when I'm on a trip
Nigga like me always got weed on 'em (got weed on 'em)
Try to tell me that she don't smoke, later on she joinin'
Ain't no point, no I'm back, keep going in
You been rolling with cats, who boring
I be bringing them stacks enormous
Section always in the back important
Bad bitch gorgeous, pack imported

[Chorus: Logic]
I can't get much higher, been smoking that fire
Riding 'round the city with my homies that know me
Know that I can't get much higher, word to my supplier
While you break it, roll it, light it, use that fire, ignite it
I can't get much higher, been smoking that fire
Riding 'round the city with my homies that know me
Know that I can't get much higher, word to my supplier
While you break it, roll it, light it, use that fire, ignite it
I can't get much higher

[Verse 3: Logic]
Uh, yeah, I'm finna get up in the feeling
Independent feeling like a boss
Roll a little something, smoke a little something
Kick back and then floss
Chiefin' that Indica in the cut, tell my anxiety to get lost
Fuck a pill, only numb the pain
Man, you know how much that shit cost?
I ain't talking 'bout your pocket
No, I am only talking about the mind
When the cannabis combine with the brain
It be like everything you see, it seem to shine
Smoking that Golden State, everything going great
Got a lot on my plate, not a single complaint
Stack of money in the bank
This that RattPack and that Taylor Gang
They know the face and they know the name
I'm a married man with a bad wife
Never fuck around unless it's Mary Jane
Come play the game, honestly never the same
Just like my flow, got one for every occasion
Living the life so my life is amazing, woo

[Chorus: Logic]
I can't get much higher, been smoking that fire
Riding 'round the city with my homies that know me
Know that I can't get much higher, word to my supplier
While you break it, roll it, light it, use that fire, ignite it
I can't get much higher, been smoking that fire
Riding 'round the city with my homies that know me
Know that I can't get much higher, word to my supplier
While you break it, roll it, light it, use that fire, ignite it
I can't get much higher

[Outro: Logic]
Yeah, and if you don't know by nowI smoke weed!
"Hahahaha," how Wiz gonna give me the verse
He ain't gonna give me the laugh though?
"Hahahaha," that shit iconic
Yeah, yeah, yeah, Indica Badu[Intro]
Life is a mystery
Everyone must stand alone
I hear you call my name
And it feels like home

[Chorus 1]
When you call my name
It's like a little prayer
I'm down on my knees
I want to take you there
In the midnight hour
I can feel your power
Just like a prayer
You know I'll take you there

[Verse 1]
I hear your voice
It's like an angel sighing
I have no choice
I hear your voice
Feels like flying
I close my eyes
Oh God, I think I'm falling
Out of the sky
I close my eyes
Heaven, help me

[Chorus 1]
When you call my name
It's like a little prayer
I'm down on my knees
I want to take you there
In the midnight hour
I can feel your power
Just like a prayer
You know I'll take you there

[Verse 2]
Like a child
You whisper softly to me
You're in control
Just like a child
Now I'm dancing
It's like a dream
No end and no beginning
You're here with me
It's like a dream
Let the choir sing

[Chorus 1]
When you call my name
It's like a little prayer
I'm down on my knees
I wanna take you there
In the midnight hour
I can feel your power
Just like a prayer
You know I'll take you there
When you call my name
It's like a little prayer
I'm down on my knees
I wanna take you there
In the midnight hour
I can feel your power
Just like a prayer
You know I'll take you there

[Reprise]
Life is a mystery
Everyone must stand alone
I hear you call my name
And it feels like home

[Chorus 2]
Just like a prayer
Your voice can take me there
Just like a muse to me
You are a mystery
Just like a dream
You are not what you seem
Just like a prayer, no choice
Your voice can take me there

[Bridge]
Just like a prayer, I'll take you there
It's like a dream to me
Just like a prayer, I'll take you there
It's like a dream to me
Just like a prayer, I'll take you there
It's like a dream to me
Just like a prayer, I'll take you there
It's like a dream to me

[Chorus 2]
Just like a prayer
Your voice can take me there
Just like a muse to me
You are a mystery
Just like a dream
You are not what you seem
Just like a prayer, no choice
Your voice can take me there
Just like a prayer
Your voice can take me there
Just like a muse to me
You are a mystery
Just like a dream
You are not what you seem
Just like a prayer, no choice
Your voice can take me there
Your voice can take me there
Like a prayer

It's like a dream to me
Just like a prayer, your voice can take me there
It's like a dream to me
Just like a prayer, your voice can take me there
It's like a dream to me
Just like a prayer, your voice can take me there
It's like a dream to me[Intro]
Cmo puede ser verdad?

[Verse 1]
Last night I dreamt of San Pedro
Just like I'd never gone, I knew the song
A young girl with eyes like the desert
It all seems like yesterday, not far away

[Chorus]
Tropical the island breeze
All of nature wild and free
This is where I long to be
La isla bonita
And when the samba played
The sun would set so high
Ring through my ears and sting my eyes
Your Spanish lullaby

[Verse 2]
I fell in love with San Pedro
Warm wind carried on the sea, he called to me
Te dijo te amo
I prayed that the days would last, they went so fast

[Chorus]
Tropical the island breeze
All of nature wild and free
This is where I long to be
La isla bonita
And when the samba played
The sun would set so high
Ring through my ears, and sting my eyes
Your Spanish lullaby

[Bridge]
I want to be where the sun warms the sky
When it's time for siesta, you can watch them go by
Beautiful faces, no cares in this world
Where a girl loves a boy, and a boy loves a girl

[Pre-Chorus]
Last night I dreamt of San Pedro
It all seems like yesterday, not far away

[Chorus]
Tropical the island breeze
All of nature wild and free
This is where I long to be
La isla bonita
And when the samba played
The sun would set so high
Ring through my ears, and sting my eyes
Your Spanish lullaby
Tropical the island breeze
All of nature wild and free
This is where I long to be
La isla bonita
And when the samba played
The sun would set so high
Ring through my ears, and sting my eyes
Your Spanish lullaby
Tropical the island breeze
All of nature wild and free
This is where I long to be
La isla bonita
And when the samba played
The sun would set so high
Ring through my ears, and sting my eyes
Your Spanish lullaby

I made it through the wilderness
Somehow I made it through
Didn't know how lost I was until I found you

Some boys kiss me, some boys hug me
I think they're okay
If they don't give me proper credit, I just walk away
They can beg and they can plead
But they can't see the light (That's right)
'Cause the boy with the cold hard cash is always Mister Right

[Chorus]
'Cause we are living in a material world
And I am a material girl
You know that we are living in a material world
And I am a material girl

[Verse 2]
Some boys romance, some boys slow dance
That's all right with me
If they can't raise my interest, then I have to let them be
Some boys try, and some boys lie
But I don't let them play, no way
Only boys that save their pennies make my rainy day

[Chorus]
'Cause we are living in a material world
And I am a material girl
You know that we are living in a material world
And I am a material girl
Living in a material world
And I am a material girl

And I'm not afraid at all to die 'cause I believe Him
God is on my side and I'll be His bride
I am not afraid 'cause I have faith in Him
You can cut my hair and throw me in a jail cell
Say that I'm a witch and burn me at the stake
It's all a big mistake
Don't you know to doubt Him is a sin?
I won't give in

[Verse 3]
They are so naive
They think we are not aware of their crimes
We know, but we are just not ready to act
The storm isn't in the air, it's inside of us
I want to tell you about love and loneliness
But it's getting late now
Can't you hear outside of your Supreme hoodie
The wind that's beginning to howl?

[Outro]
It's a beautiful life[Verse 1: Madonna]
Everybody knows the damn truth
Our nation lied, we lost respect
When we wake up, what can we do?
Get the kids ready, take them to school
Everybody knows they dont have a chance
To get a decent job, to have a normal life
When they talk reforms, it makes me laugh
They pretend to help, it makes me laugh
I think I understand why people get a gun
I think I understand why we all give up
Every day they have a kind of victory
Blood of innocence, spread everywhere
They say that we need love
But we need more than this

[Refrain: Tiffin Children's Choir]
We lost God control
We lost God control
We lost God control
We lost God control

[Verse 2: Madonna]
This is your wake-up call
I'm like your nightmare
I'm here to start your day
This is your wake-up call
We dont have to fall
A new democracy
God and pornography
A new democracy

[Chorus: Madonna]
People think that Im insane
The only gun is in my brain
Each new birth, it gives me hope
Thats why I dont smoke that dope
Insane people think I am
Brain inside my only friend
Hope it gives me birth each new
That dope I dont smoke, its true

[Bridge: Madonna]
Everybody knows the damn truth
Everybody knows the damn truth (Wake up)
We need to wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up
We need to make up, make up, make up, make up, make up, make up, make up, make up, make up, make up
Its a hustle, yeah
Its a hustle
Its a con
Its a hustle
Its a weird kind of energy, a bizarre thing that happens to be
An abnormal fraternity, and I feel more than sympathy
We got to wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up
We need to make up, make up, make up, make up, make up, make up, make up, make up, make up, make up

[Chorus: Madonna]
People think that Im insane
The only gun is in my brain
Each new birth, it gives me hope
Thats why I dont smoke that dope
Insane people think I am
Brain inside my only friend
Hope it gives me birth each new
That dope I dont smoke, its true

[Chorus 2: Madonna]
Everybody knows the damn truth
Everybody knows the damn truth
We got to wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up
(Wake up)
Ah (Ah), Ah (Ah)

[Interlude]
A new democracy!

[Verse 3: Madonna]
Everybody knows the damn truth
Our nation lied, weve lost respect
When we wake up, what can we do
Get the kids ready, take them to school
Everybody knows they dont have a chance
Get a decent job, have a normal life
When they talk reforms, it makes me laugh
They pretend to help, it makes me laugh

Papa, I know you're going to be upset
'Cause I was always your little girl
But you should know by now, I'm not a baby
You always taught me right from wrong
I need your help, daddy, please be strong
I may be young at heart, but I know what I'm saying

[Pre-Chorus]
The one you warned me all about
The one you said I could do without
We're in an awful mess
And I don't mean maybe
Please...

[Chorus]
Papa don't preach
I'm in trouble, deep
Papa don't preach
I've been losing sleep
But I made up my mind, I'm keeping my baby
Ooh, I'm gonna keep my baby, mmm

[Verse 2]
He says that he's going to marry me
We can raise a little family
Maybe we'll be all right, it's a sacrifice

[Pre-Chorus]
But my friends keep telling me to give it up
Saying I'm too young, I ought to live it up
What I need right now is some good advice
Please...

[Chorus]
Papa don't preach
I'm in trouble, deep
Papa don't preach
I've been losing sleep
But I made up my mind, I'm keeping my baby
Ooh, I'm gonna keep my baby, mmm

[Bridge]
Daddy, daddy
If you could only see just how good he's been treating me
You'd give us your blessing right now
'Cause we are in love
We are in love, so please

Papa don't preach
I'm in trouble, deep
Papa don't preach
I've been losing sleep
But I made up my mind, I'm keeping my baby
Ooh, I'm gonna keep my baby, mmm

Every little thing that you say or do
I'm hung up, I'm hung up on you
Waiting for your call, baby, night and day
I'm fed up, I'm tired of waiting on you

Time goes by so slowly for those who wait
No time to hesitate
Those who run seem to have all the fun
I'm caught up
I don't know what to do

[Verse 2]
Ring, ring, ring goes the telephone
The lights are on, but there's no one home
Tick tick tock, it's a quarter to two
And I'm done
I'm hanging up on you
I can't keep on waiting for you
I know that you're still hesitating
Don't cry for me, 'cause I'll find my way
You'll wake up one day
But it'll be too late

[Chorus]
Every little thing that you say or do
I'm hung up, I'm hung up on you
Waiting for your call, baby, night and day
I'm fed up, I'm tired of waiting on you
Every little thing that you say or do
I'm hung up, I'm hung up on you
Waiting for your call, baby, night and day
I'm fed up, I'm tired of waiting on you

Waiting for you call, waiting for you call

I've been waiting for somebody to pick up my stroll
Well, don't waste time
Give me a sign, tell me how you wanna roll, mmm
I want somebody to speed it up for me
Then take it down slow
There's enough room for both
Well, I can handle that
You just gotta show me where it's at
Are you ready to go?
Are you ready to go?

Sometimes I think what I need is a "you" intervention, yeah
And you know I can tell that you like it
And that it's good, by the way that you move, oh hey
The road to hell is paved with good intentions, yeah
But if I die tonight, at least I can say I did what I wanted to do
Tell me, how 'bout you?

Wake up, ex-wife
This is your life
Children, on your own
Turning on the telephone
Messages, manager
No time for a manicure
Working out, shake my ass
I know how to multitask
Connecting to the Wi-Fi
Went from nerd to superb
Have you seen the new guy?
I forgot the password
Gotta call the babysitter
Tweeting on the elevator
I could take a helicopter
I don't even feel the pressure

[Chorus: Madonna]
I'm gonna be okay
I don't care what the people say
I'm gonna be alright
Gonna live fast and I'm gonna live right
I'm moving fast, can you follow my track?
I'm moving fast and I like it like that
I do ten things all at once
And if you have a problem, I don't give a...

[Verse 2: Madonna]
You were so mad at me
Who's got custody?
Lawyers, suck it up
Didn't have a pre-nup
Make a film, write a song
Gotta get my stockings on
Meet the press, buy the dress
All of this to impress
RIde my horse, break some bones
Take it down a semitone
I forgot to say my prayers
Baby Jesus on the stairs
Gotta sign a contract
Gotta get my money back
All the bottles have to go
Standing in the front row

[Chorus: Madonna]
I'm gonna be okay
I don't care what the people say
I'm gonna be alright
Gonna live fast and I'm gonna live right
I'm moving fast, can you follow my track?
I'm moving fast and I like it like that
I do ten things all at once
And if you have a problem, I don't give a...

[Bridge: Madonna]
I tried to be a good girl
I tried to be your wife
Diminished myself and swallowed my light
I tried to become all that you expect of me
And if it was a failure, I don't give a...
(I don't give a, I-I-I don't
I don't give a, I-I-I don't
I don't give a, I-I-I don't
I don't give a...)

[Verse 3: Nicki Minaj & (Madonna)]
Shots fire!
Anything you hear Nicki on, that's fire!
You don't hear them bums on nothing, that's fire!
Tell 'em, "catch fire"
In the Bugatti, ten grand, one tire
Ayo Madonna (Yes, Nicki?)
Mi yuh say you original, Don Dada
Inna ya Gabbana, inna all ya Prada!
We material girls, ain't nobody hotter
Pops collar!
See, I really can't relate to your Volvo
And you can't get these shoes at the Aldo
When I let a dude go, that's his loss
I was cutting them checks, I was his boss!
Yo, I don't give a F you, curse nor bless you
Never let 'em stress you, yo
I ain't a businesswoman, I'm a business, woman!
And I'm known for giving bitches the business, woman

[Chorus: Madonna]
I'm gonna be okay
I don't care what the people say
I'm gonna be alright
Gonna live fast and I'm gonna live right
I'm moving fast, can you follow my track?
I'm moving fast and I like it like that
I do ten things all at once
And if you have a problem, I don't give a...

[Outro: Nicki Minaj]
There's only one queen and that's Madonna
Bitch![Verse 1: Madonna]
I'm tired of being far away from home
Far from what can help, far from where it's safe
Hope it's not too late
Rush, rush, rush on you, love, love, loved on you
Love you like a fool, put my trust in you

[Pre-Chorus: Madonna & Swae Lee]
'Cause you're the one I crave
And my cravings get dangerous
The feelings never fade

I'm not afraid, take me to that place

You're on me, I don't think you should wait (Wait)
You're only one pull up away (Away)
You're down to ride, you ride me like a wave (Ride, yeah)
I gave you a sensation (Ooh)
A loner, days we used to chase
It's do or die, yeah, my love life can get crazy (Crazy)
It's on the line, girl, you're risking everything (Thing)
It's over-X-rated

[Bridge: Madonna & Swae Lee]
Ran so far to try to find the thing I lacked and there it was
Inside (Side) of (Of) me (Me)
Ran and ran and ran so fast, a thing to last, and there it was
I hear (Hear) you (You) breathe (Breathe)

[Pre-Chorus: Madonna, Swae Lee & Both]
'Cause you're the one I crave (Crave)

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm goin' through it, yeah
I know you see the tragic in it
Just hold on to the little bit of magic in it
I can't break down now

I rise, I rise
I rise up above it, up above it
I rise, I rise

River of tears ran dry, let 'em run
No game that you can play with me, I ain't won

'Cause I'm goin' through it, yeah
I know you see the tragic in it (Alright)
Just hold on to the little bit of magic in it (Yeah)

No one can hurt you now unless you love 'em too (B.S.)
Unless you love 'em too

Come on girls
Do you believe in love?
'Cause I got something to say about it
And it goes something like this

[Chorus 1]
Don't go for second best, baby
Put your love to the test
You know, you know, you've got to
Make him express how he feels
And maybe then you'll know your love is real

[Verse 1]
You don't need diamond rings
Or eighteen karat gold
Fancy cars that go very fast
You know they never last, no no
What you need is a big strong hand
To lift you to your higher ground
Make you feel like a queen on a throne
Make him love you till you can't come down

[Chorus 1]
Don't go for second best, baby
Put your love to the test
You know, you know, you've got to
Make him express how he feels
And maybe then you'll know your love is real

[Verse 2]
Long stem roses are the way to your heart
But he needs to start with your head
Satin sheets are very romantic
What happens when you're not in bed?
You deserve the best in life
So if the time isn't right, then move on
Second best is never enough
You'll do much better, baby, on your own

[Chorus 2]
Don't go for second best, baby
Put your love to the test
You know, you know, you've got to
Make him express how he feels
And maybe then you'll know your love is real
Express yourself
You've got to make him express himself
Hey, hey, hey, hey
So if you want it right now, make him show you how
Express what he's got, oh baby, ready or not

[Refrain]
And when you're gone he might regret it
Think about the love he once had
Try to carry on, but he just won't get it
He'll be back on his knees
To express himself
You've got to make him express himself
Hey hey

[Verse 3]
What you need is a big strong hand
To lift you to your higher ground
Make you feel like a queen on a throne
Make him love you till you can't come down

[Refrain]
And when you're gone he might regret it
Think about the love he once had
Try to carry on, but he just won't get it
He'll be back on his knees, so please

[Chorus 2]
Don't go for second best, baby
Put your love to the test
You know, you know, you've got to
Make him express how he feels
And maybe then you'll know your love is real
Express yourself
You've got to make him express himself
Hey, hey, hey, hey
So if you want it right now, make him show you how
Express what he's got, oh baby, ready or not
Express yourself[Verse 1]
You only see what your eyes want to see
How can life be what you want it to be?
You're frozen
When your heart's not open
You're so consumed with how much you get
You waste your time with hate and regret
You're broken
When your heart's not open

[Chorus]
Mmmmmm, if I could melt your heart
Mmmmmm, we'd never be apart
Mmmmmm, give yourself to me
Mmmmmm, you hold the key

[Verse 2]
Now there's no point in placing the blame
And you should know I suffer the same
If I lose you
My heart will be broken
Love is a bird, she needs to fly
Let all the hurt inside of you die
You're frozen
When your heart's not open

[Chorus]
Mmmmmm, if I could melt your heart
Mmmmmm, we'd never be apart
Mmmmmm, give yourself to me
Mmmmmm, you hold the key

[Verse 1]
You only see what your eyes want to see
How can life be what you want it to be?


You're frozen
When your heart's not open

[Chorus]
Mmmmmm, if I could melt your heart
Mmmmmm, we'd never be apart
Mmmmmm, give yourself to me
Mmmmmm, you hold the key
If I could melt your heart
Mmmmmm, we'd never be apart
Mmmmmm, give yourself to me
Mmmmmm, you hold the key

[Outro]
If I could melt your heart[Intro: Madonna]

Lets forget about time, and dance our lives away[Intro: Nas]
Madonna, life is so crazy
You've been through a lot
I'll tell you stories sometimes, y'know?

[Verse 1: Madonna]
Seemed like yesterday, I was a baby on the street
I took a holiday, I was steppin' to the beat
I had to pay my rent, on the lower east side
I threw my tag around, let B-boys take me for a ride
I started writing songs, I kinda got into the groove
They tried to criticize my every single move
But then I realized I had nothing left to lose
It took me by surprise when I became the news

[Chorus: Madonna]
I was fearless like a renegade
I had a feeling that I can't explain
I didn't listen to what people said
I came, I saw, I conquered
I was constant as a northern star
I had a fire burning in my heart
I never gave up fighting in the dark
I came, I saw, I conquered
(Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
I came, I saw, I conquered
(Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
I came, I saw, I conquered

[Verse 2: Madonna]
(Talk to 'em, talk to 'em)
I expressed myself, came like a virgin down the aisle
Exposed my naked ass, and I did it with a smile
And when it came to sex, I knew I walked the borderline
And when I struck a pose, all the gay boys lost their mind
I justified my love, I made you say a little prayer
Had me crucified, you know I had to take you there
I opened up my heart, I learned the power of good-bye
I saw a ray of light, music saved my life (music saved my life)

[Chorus]
I was fearless like a renegade
I had a feeling that I can't explain
I didn't listen to what people said
I came, I saw, I conquered
I was constant as a northern star
I had a fire burning in my heart
I never gave up fighting in the dark
I came, I saw, I conquered
(Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
I came, I saw, I conquered
(Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
I came, I saw, I conquered

[Verse 3: Nas]
In 1994, I came through the door
With that born beats versus scratches
Verbally murdered rappers
My mom's from the Carolina's, pops from Natchez
And QB's where I started flowin'
But I was scared the cops was gonna kick my apartment door in
Had a baby girl by a crazy girl, then I got married
Heavily accosted, that ended in a bad divorce
I know how to pick 'em, don't I?
Never gave a fuck about public pressure
Or the ridicule, I'm too big to lose
Now who's the fool?
And I ain't never been happier, no lie
I'm just your humble servant, I'm Nas
If y'all burn down Ferguson, I'ma riot
My life cannot be compared to anybody
Any trappers, any rapper
Any politician, beautician, or musician
Anybody, saw many bodies
Many coffins, heads or tails
Penny tosses keep a man in jail
Not many options on the block I came from
And I turned to a rap messiah, spit rapid fire
And I roll right back to the block I came from

[Chorus]
I was fearless like a renegade
I had a feeling that I can't explain
I didn't listen to what people said
I came, I saw, I conquered
I was constant as a northern star
I had a fire burning in my heart
I never gave up fighting in the dark
I came, I saw, I conquered
(Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
I came, I saw, I conquered
(Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
I came, I saw, I conquered

[Outro: Nas]

I've heard it all before
I've heard it all before

[Chorus]
I don't wanna hear, I don't wanna know
Please don't say you're sorry
I've heard it all before
And I can take care of myself
I don't want to hear, I don't want to know
Please don't say 'forgive me'
I've seen it all before
And I can't take it anymore

[Verse 1]
You're not half the man you think you are
Save your words because you've gone too far
I've listened to your lies and all your stories
You're not half the man you'd like to be

[Chorus]
I don't wanna hear, I don't wanna know
Please don't say you're sorry
I've heard it all before
And I can take care of myself
I don't wanna hear, I don't wanna know
Please don't say 'forgive me'
I've seen it all before
And I can't take it anymore

[Verse 2]
Don't explain yourself 'cause talk is cheap
There's more important things than hearing you speak
You stayed because I made it so convenient
Don't explain yourself, you'll never see

[Spoken Interlude]
Gomenasai
Mujhe maaf kardo
Przepraszam

[Chorus]
I don't wanna hear, I don't wanna know
Please don't say you're sorry
I've heard it all before
And I can take care of myself
I don't wanna hear, I don't wanna know
Please don't say 'forgive me'
I've seen it all before
And I can't take it anymore

[Outro]
Don't explain yourself 'cause talk is cheap
There's more important things than hearing you speak
I don't wanna hear, I don't wanna know
Please don't say 'forgive me'[Verse 1]
Swaying room as the music starts
Strangers making the most of the dark
Two by two their bodies become one

[Verse 2]
I see you through the smokey air
Can't you feel the weight of my stare
You're so close but still a world away
What I'm dying to say, is that

[Chorus]
I'm crazy for you
Touch me once and you'll know it's true
I never wanted anyone like this
It's all brand new
You'll feel it in my kiss
I'm crazy for you, crazy for you

[Verse 3]
Trying hard to control my heart
I walk over to where you are
Eye to eye we need no words at all

[Verse 4]
Slowly now we begin to move
Every breath I'm deeper into you
Soon we two are standing still in time
If you read my mind, you'll see

[Chorus]
I'm crazy for you
Touch me once and you'll know it's true
I never wanted anyone like this
It's all brand new
You'll feel it in my kiss
You'll feel it in my kiss
Because I'm crazy for you
Touch me once and you'll know it's true
I never wanted anyone like this
It's all brand new
You'll feel it in my kiss
I'm crazy for you
Crazy for you
Crazy for you

[Outro]
It's all brand new, I'm crazy for you
And you know it's true
I'm crazy, crazy for you
It's all brand new, I'm crazy for you
And you know it's true
Yeah, I'm crazy for you
Crazy for you, baby
I'm crazy for you
Crazy for you, baby[Verse 1]
I will be gay, if the gay are burned
I'll be Africa, if Africa is shut down
I will be poor, if the poor are humiliated
And I'll be a child, if the children are exploited

[Pre-Chorus 1]
I know what I am
And I know what I'm not

[Chorus]
O mundo  selvagem

[Verse 2]
I'll be Islam, if Islam is hated
I'll be Israel, if they're incarcerated
I'll be Native Indian, if the Indian has been taken
And I'll be a woman, if she's raped and her heart is breaking

[Pre-Chorus 2]
I know what I am (God knows what I am)
And I know what I'm not (And He knows what I'm not)
Do you know who you are?
Will we know when to stop?

Welcome to the future, it's a culture ride (Ride)
Too much pain inside

Zephyr in the sky at night, I wonder
Do my tears of mourning sink beneath the sun?
She's got herself a universe gone quickly
For the call of thunder threatens everyone

[Chorus]
And I feel like I just got home
And I feel
And I feel like I just got home
And I feel

[Verse 2]
Faster than the speeding light she's flying
Trying to remember where it all began
She's got herself a little piece of heaven
Waiting for the time when Earth shall be as one

[Chorus]
And I feel like I just got home
And I feel
And I feel like I just got home
And I feel

[Post-Chorus]
Quicker than a ray of light
Quicker than a ray of light
Quicker than a ray of light

[Verse 1]
Zephyr in the sky at night, I wonder
Do my tears of mourning sink beneath the sun?
She's got herself a universe gone quickly
For the call of thunder threatens everyone

[Middle 8]
And I feel
Quicker than a ray of light, then gone for
Someone else will be there
Through the endless years

[Outro]
She's got herself a universe
She's got herself a universe
She's got herself a universe
And I feel
And I feel
And I feel like I just got home
And I feel
Quicker than a ray of light, she's flying
Quicker than a ray of light, I'm flying[Verse 1]
It's not Jay-Z and Beyonc

It's not triangles or stacks of cash
Black magic or Gaga
Gucci or Prada
Riding on the Golden Calf

All-Seeing Eye is watching tonight
That's what it is, Truth and the Light
All-Seeing Eye is watching tonight
Nothing to hide, the secret's inside

[Chorus]
It's like, everybody in this party shining like Illuminati
It's like, everybody in this party shining like Illuminati

[Post-Chorus 1]
It's the enlightenment that started it all
The Founding Fathers wrote it down on the wall
And now the media's misleading us all
Turned right into wrong
It's time to dance and turn this dark into something
So let the fire burn, this music is bumping
We're gonna live forever, love never dies
It starts tonight

[Verse 2]
Behind the curtain of the New World Order
It's not platinum encrypted corners
It's not ISIS or the Phoenix
Pyramids of Egypt
Don't make it into something sordid
It's not Steve Jobs or Bill Gates
It's not the Google of United States
It's not Bieber or LeBron
Clinton or Obama
Or anyone you love to hate

[Pre-Chorus]
All-Seeing Eye is watching tonight
That's what it is, Truth and the Light
All-Seeing Eye is watching tonight
Nothing to hide, secret's inside

[Chorus]
It's like, everybody in this party, shining like Illuminati
It's like, everybody in this party, shining like Illuminati

[Post-Chorus 2]
You know that everything that glitters ain't gold
So let the music take you out of control
It's time to feel it in your body and soul
C'mon, let's go
We're gonna dance and turn this dark into something
So let the fire burn, this music is bumping
We're gonna live forever, love never dies
It starts tonight

[Breakdown]
It's like
It's like
It's like, everybody in this party, shining like illuminati
It's like, everybody in this party, shining like illuminati

I spent all night waitin' up
It's gon' be the last night I wait up for you
Spent a long time wakin' up
Used to think that I was not enough for you
Now I see that I'm just way too much
You got your hands full, I misunderstood
Now I see that I'm who I can trust
And you got a lot of wrong you're tryna make good

[Pre-Chorus]
But if you think I've been foolish
And you only fool me once
I guess it's shame on you
Said now, if you think I've been foolish
And you keep on tryna do it
Baby, I'ma switch the plans on you

[Chorus]
'Cause you're driving me crazy
You must think I'm crazy
Voc me pe to louca
Voc pensa que eu sou louca
And I won't let you drive me crazy
I won't let you drive me crazy
Voc no vai me pr to louca
Voc no vai me pr to louca

[Verse 2]
I bent my knees for you like a prayer
My God, look at me now
Peel off my weakness, layer after layer
Nothing left for me to keep 'round
I'm a force and I won't tame, babe
Can't go through this and stay the same, babe
I've seen a lot of stranger things, babe
And I'll never look at you the same

[Pre-Chorus]
But if you think I've been foolish
And you only fool me once
I guess it's shame on you
Said now, if you think I've been foolish
And you keep on tryna do it
Baby, I'ma switch the plans on you

[Chorus]
'Cause you're driving me crazy
You must think I'm crazy
Voc me pe to louca
Voc pensa que eu sou louca
And I won't let you drive me crazy
I won't let you drive me crazy
Voc no vai me pr to louca
Voc no vai me pr to louca

[Bridge]
Eu te amo
Mas no deixo voc me destruir
I put you on a pedestal, but statues, they can fall
Felt so safe, I let you drive me straight into the war
Paid the hell you dealt me, thought you felt me
Was never good at games, now I'll just forget your name
(Forget your name) Mmm

[Pre-Chorus]
But if you think I've been foolish
And you only fool me once
I guess it's shame on you
Said now, if you think I've been foolish
And you keep on tryna do it
Baby, I'ma switch the plans on you

[Chorus]
'Cause you're driving me crazy
You must think I'm crazy
Voc me pe to louca
Voc pensa que eu sou louca
And I won't let you drive me crazy
I won't let you drive me crazy (Crazy)
Voc no vai me pr to louca
Voc no vai me pr to louca (Louca)
'Cause you're driving me crazy
You must think I'm crazy
Voc me pe to louca
Voc pensa que eu sou louca
And I won't let you drive me crazy
I won't let you drive me crazy
Voc no vai me pr to louca
Voc no vai me pr to louca[Verse 1]
I went to the far right
Then I went to the far left
I tried to recover my center of gravity

[Chorus]
I guess I'm lost
I had to pay the cost
The thing that hurt me most
Was that I wasn't lost

[Verse 2]
I came from the Midwest
Then I went to the Far East
I tried to discover my own identity

[Chorus]
I guess Im lost
I paid a handsome cost
The thing that hurt the most
Was that I wasn't lost
I wasn't lost

[Bridge]
No, I wasn't lost
It was a different feeling
A mix of lucidity and craziness
But I wasn't lost, you believe me
I was right, and I've got the right
To choose my own life like a full circle
Life is a circle, life is a circle, life is a circle, life is a circle
Life is a circle, life is a circle, life is a circle, life is a circle
Aquilo que mais magoa
 que eu no estava perdida
Aquilo que mais magoa
 que eu no estava perdida

[Chorus]
I guess I'm lost
I had to pay the cost
The thing that hurt me most
Was that I wasn't lost
I wasn't lost[Verse 1]
I have a tale to tell
Sometimes, it gets so hard to hide it well
I was not ready for the fall
Too blind to see the writing on the wall

[Chorus]
A man can tell a thousand lies
I've learned my lesson well
Hope I live to tell the secret I have learned
'Til then, it will burn inside of me

[Verse 2]
I know where beauty lives
I've seen it once, I know the warm she gives
The light that you could never see
It shines inside, you can't take that from me

[Chorus]
A man can tell a thousand lies
I've learned my lesson well
Hope I live to tell the secret I have learned
'Til then, it will burn inside of me

[Post-Chorus]
The truth is never far behind
You kept it hidden well
If I live to tell the secret I knew
Then will I ever have the chance again?

[Bridge]
If I ran away, I'd never have the strength to go very far
How would they hear the beating of my heart?
Will it grow cold, the secret that I hide? Will I grow old?
How will they hear? When will they learn? How will they know?

[Chorus]
A man can tell a thousand lies
I've learned my lesson well
Hope I live to tell the secret I have learned
'Til then, it will burn inside of me

[Post-Chorus]
The truth is never far behind
You kept it hidden well
If I live to tell the secret I knew
Then will I ever have the chance again?

[Chorus]
A man can tell a thousand lies
I've learned my lesson well
Hope I live to tell the secret I have learned
'Til then, it will burn inside of me[Intro: Mike Tyson]
I'm the best the world has ever seen (I'm the best ever!)
I'm somebody you'll never forget 'cause I work hard and sweat in my tears (Can't be stopped!)
I'm never falling again and if I did, I'd come back

[Verse 1: Madonna]
If you try and fail, get up again
Destiny will choose you in the end
If you don't make the choice, and you don't use your voice
Someone else will speak for you instead

[Verse 2: Madonna]
What you want is just within' your reach
But you gotta practice what you preach
You pay with sweat and tears to overcome your fears
Never let the fire inside you leave

[Chorus: Madonna]
"I-can't", "icon" - two letters apart
One step away from being lost in the dark
Just shine your light like a beautiful star
Show the world who you are, who you are
Yeah, there's another part of you no one sees
There's a burning fire that's underneath
Baby, don't you know you were meant to be
Born to be, meant to be

Alright
Firefly change when they catch ya
Wanna put ya in their net for their light glow
Yellow brick highway
Paparazzi piled up on the high road
They just turned the sun into an idol
They just wanna see how high the sky go
Just to find how it feel to fall back
Madonna said I remind her of Michael
Steady blowing up my head, blowing up my head
Put it on your wall
Put me in the school book, put me in the laws
Put me in the desk and in the Synagogue
Firefly glow when they catch ya
Wanna catch ya when ya lights go dim
Wanna turn you to a letter in their logo
Wanna stick you in a jar with a pen
You an icon

[Chorus: Madonna]

Take a bow, the night is over
This masquerade is getting older
Lights are low, the curtains down
There's no one here
There's no one here, there's no one in the crowd
Say your lines, but do you feel them?
Do you mean what you say when there's no one around?
No one around
Watching you, watching me, one lonely star
One lonely star, you don't know who you are

[Chorus: Madona and Babyface]
I've always been in love with you
Always with you
I guess you've always known it's true
You know it's true
You took my love for granted, why, oh, why?
The show is over, say good-bye
Say good-bye
Bye-bye

[Verse 2: Madona and Babyface]
Make them laugh, it comes so easy
When you get to the part
Where you're breaking my heart
Breaking my heart
Hide behind your smile, all the world loves a clown
Just make them smile the whole world loves a clown
Wish you well, I cannot stay
You deserve an award for the role that you played
Role that you played
No more masquerade, you're one lonely star
One lonely star and you don't know who you are

Maybe it was all too much

Facing the darkest days
Everyone ran away
We're gonna stay here, we're gonna stay here

Let's just hold onto each other
When it all falls, when it all falls down
We'll be two souls in a Ghosttown

[Verse 2]
Tell me how we got this far
Every man for himself
Everything's gone to hell
We gotta stay strong, we're gonna hold on
This world has turned to dust
All we've got left is love
Might as well start with us
Singing a new song, something to build on

I know you're scared tonight
Ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah

Let's just hold onto each other
When it all falls, when it all falls down
We'll be two souls in a Ghosttown

I know we're alright
'Cause we'll never be alone in this mad, mad
In this mad, mad world
Even with no light, we're gonna shine like gold in this mad, mad
In this mad, mad world

When it all falls, when it all falls down
I'll be your fire when the lights go out
When there's no one, no one else around
We'll be two souls in a Ghosttown

When it all falls, when it all falls down
I'll be your fire when the lights go out
When there's no one, no one else around
We'll be two souls in a Ghosttown

Mucho que me asusta
Por eso no te vas?

[Verse 1: Maluma]
Lleg a la disco montando
Perrear con sus amigas, es lo que le gusta
Ella es la reina de su combo y nada la intimida
Es que es la ms dura
Slo utiliza Chanel
Qu bien lo combina con su joya Cartier
Dicen que su ex-novio la dej por infiel
Le gustan menores como yo, se le ve

[Pre-Chorus: Madonna & Maluma]
Mira cmo se mueve, cmo me baila
Cmo me tiene tra-tranquila
Cmo se mueve, cmo me baila y me entretiene

Pero si me pide yo se lo co, lo co

[Verse 3: Madonna]
Maybe you only had a message
That you can manage this type of entertainment
I haven't let a boy who was a bit of damage
Somehow I think you like that, I see if you can last
Forget about the future and we have no past
I like the way you move and you know you're just my type
I guess you like a crazy girl but it's alright

[Pre-Chorus: Madonna & Maluma]
Mira cmo se mueve, cmo me baila
Cmo me tiene tra-tranquila
Cmo se mueve, cmo me baila y me entretiene, yeah yeah!

Um, you can put it inside

Something in the way you love me won't let me be
I don't want to be your prisoner
So baby, won't you set me free?
Stop playing with my heart
Finish what you start
When you make my love come down
If you want me, let me know
Baby, let it show
Honey, don't you fool around

Just try to understand, I've given all I can
'Cause you got the best of me

Don't you know you drive me crazy?

Something in your eyes is making such a fool of me
When you hold me in your arms, you love me 'til I just can't see
But then you let me down
When I look around, baby, you just can't be found
Stop driving me away
I just want to stay
There's something I just got to say

Look what your love has done to me

You cause me so much pain
I think I'm going insane
What does it take to make you see?
You just keep on pushing my love over the borderline

Keep pushing me, keep pushing me
Keep pushing my love
C'mon, baby
C'mon, darling, yeah
You just keep on pushing my love over the borderline[Spoken Intro]
Oh my God
I am heartly sorry for having offended thee
And I detest all my sins
Because I dread the loss of heaven and the pain of hell
But most of all, because I love thee
And I want so badly to be good

It's like the force of gravity right up under my feet
It's so erotic
This feeling can't be beat
It's coursing through my whole body, feel the heat

I got that burnin' hot desire
And no one can put out my fire
It's coming right down through the wire
Here it comes

My inhibition's gone away
I feel like sinning
You got me in the zone
DJ play my favorite song
Turn me on

I got that burnin' hot desire
And no one can put out my fire
It's coming right down through the wire
Here it comes

Take my sins and wash them away
Teach me how to pray
I've been stranded here in the dark
Take these walls away
I've been swimming in the ocean 'til I'm almost drowned
Give me something I can believe in
Teach me how to pray

[Pre-Chorus]
And we can do drugs, and we can smoke weed, and we can drink whiskey
Yeah, we can get high, and we can get stoned
And we can sniff glue, and we can do E, and we can drop acid
Forever be lost, with no way home

[Chorus]
Yeah, we can run and we can hide, but we won't find the answers
If you go down, then you'll get help along the way
But if you wanna save your soul, then we should travel all together
And make the devil pray

Oooh save my, oooh save my, oooh save my
Devil's here to fool ya

Mother Mary, can't you help me?
'Cause I've gone astray
All the angels that were around me have all flown away
The ground beneath my feet's getting warmer
Lucifer is near
Holding on, but I'm getting weaker
Watch me disappear

Holding on to me so tight (Ooh)
What more can I do?
Oh baby, all I want for Christmas is you
You, baby

[Bridge]
Oh, all the lights are shining
So brightly everywhere (So brightly, baby)
And the sound of children's
Laughter fills the air (Oh, oh yeah)
And everyone is singing (Oh yeah)
I hear those sleigh bells ringing (Oh)
Santa, won't you bring me the one I really need? (Yeah, oh, oh)
Won't you please bring my baby to me?

[Verse 3]
Oh, I don't want a lot for Christmas
This is all I'm asking for (Ah)
I just wanna see my baby
Standing right outside my door

[Chorus]
Oh, I just want you for my own (Ooh)
More than you could ever know (Ooh)
Make my wish come true
Oh baby, all I want for Christmas is you

[Outro]
You, baby
All I want for Christmas is you, baby (You)
All I want for Christmas is you, baby (Ah, oh, ah, oh)
All I want for Christmas is you, baby (You)
All I want for Christmas is you, baby (All I really want, baby, ooh)
All I want for Christmas is you, baby (All I want, all I really want is you)[Intro]
Ooh, oh oh
Sweet love, yeah

[Verse 1]
I didn't mean it when I said I didn't love you so
I should have held on tight, I never should have let you go
I didn't know nothing, I was stupid
I was foolish, I was lying to myself
I couldnt have fathomed I would ever be without your love
Never imagined I'd be sitting here beside myself
'Cause I didnt know you, 'cause I didnt know me
But I thought I knew everything
I never felt

[Pre-Chorus 1]
The feeling that Im feeling now that I dont hear your voice
Or have your touch and kiss your lips cause I dont have a choice
Oh, what I wouldnt give to have you lying by my side
Right here, cause baby

[Chorus]
When you left, I lost a part of me
It's still so hard to believe
Come back, baby, please
Cause we belong together
Who else am I gonna lean on when times get rough?
Whos gonna talk to me on the phone 'til the sun comes up?
Whos gonna take your place? There ain't nobody better
Oh, baby baby, we belong together

[Verse 2]
I can't sleep at night, when you are on my mind
Bobby Womack's on the radio
Singing to me, "If you think you're lonely now"
Wait a minute, this is too deep (Too deep)
I gotta change the station
So I turn the dial tryin' to catch a break
And then I hear Babyface
"I only think of you"
And it's breaking my heart
I'm tryna keep it together, but I'm falling apart

[Pre-Chorus 2]
I'm feeling all out of my element
Throwing things, cryin' tryin'
To figure out where the hell I went wrong
The pain reflected in this song
Ain't even half of what I'm feeling inside
I need you, need you back in my life, baby

[Chorus]
When you left, I lost a part of me
It's still so hard to believe
Come back, baby, please
Cause we belong together
Who else am I gonna lean on when times get rough?
Whos gonna talk to me on the phone 'til the sun comes up?
Whos gonna take your place? There ain't nobody better
Oh, baby baby, we belong together

[Outro]
Baby, when you left, I lost a part of me
It's still so hard to believe
Come back, baby, please
Cause we belong together
Who am I gonna lean on when times get rough?
Whos gonna talk to me 'til the sun comes up?
Whos gonna take your place? There ain't nobody better
Oh, baby baby, we belong together[Intro: Mariah Carey]
Ah, ah, youre beautiful (Yeah)
Ah, ah, youre beautiful

[Verse 1: Miguel]
Hop on the back of my bike
Let the good wind blow through your hair
With an ass like that and a smile so bright
Oh, youre killing me, you know it aint fair, yeah
Ride on through the middle of the night
Let the moonlight kiss your skin
When you dance like that, your jeans so tight
Oh, youre killing me, baby, do it again, yeah

[Chorus: Miguel & Both]

Always in control, how you do it, I dont know
But I dont care, take me anywhere

[Chorus: Mariah Carey & Both]
Cause its beautiful
Oh, you make me feel undressable

[Intro]
I was like, "Why are you so obsessed with me?"
So oh, oh, oh, oh...

[Verse 1]
All up in the blogs saying we met at the bar
When I don't even know who you are
Saying we up in your house, saying I'm up in your car
But you in LA, and I'm out at Jermaine's
I'm up in the A, you so, so lame
And no one here even mentions your name
It must be the weed, it must be the E
'Cause you be popping, heard you get it popping

[Chorus]
Why you so obsessed with me? Boy, I wanna know
Lying that you're sexing me, when everybody knows
It's clear that you're upset with me
Finally found a girl that you couldn't impress
Last man on the earth, still couldn't get this
You're delusional, you're delusional
Boy, you're losing your mind
It's confusing, yo, you're confused, you know
Why you wasting your time?
Got you all fired up with your Napoleon complex
Seeing right through you like you're bathing in Windex

[Post-Chorus]
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Boy, why you so obsessed with me?
So oh, oh, oh, oh, so oh, oh, oh, oh
(And all my ladies sing)
So oh, oh, oh, oh, so oh, oh, oh, oh
(And all the girls say)
Obsessed, obsessed, obsessed...

[Verse 2]
You on your job, you hating hard
Ain't gon' feed you, I'ma let you starve
Gasping for air, I'm ventilation
You out of breath, hope you ain't waiting
Telling the world how much you miss me
But we never were, so why you tripping?
You a mom and pop, I'm a corporation
I'm the press conference, you a conversation

[Chorus]
Why you so obsessed with me? and boy, I wanna know
Lying that you're sexing me, when everybody knows
It's clear that you're upset with me
Finally found a girl that you couldn't impress
Last man on the earth still couldn't get this
You're delusional, you're delusional
Boy, you're losing your mind
It's confusing, yo, you're confused, you know?
Why you wasting your time?
Got you all fired up with your Napoleon complex
Seeing right through you like you're bathing in Windex

[Post-Chorus]
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Boy, why you so obsessed with me?
So oh, oh, oh, oh, so oh, oh, oh, oh
(And all my ladies say)
So oh, oh, oh, oh, so oh, oh, oh, oh
(And all my girls say)
Obsessed, obsessed, obsessed...

[Chorus]
(He's all up in my George Foreman)
Why you so obsessed with me? Boy, I wanna know
Lying that you're sexing me, when everybody knows
(Lying that you're sexing Mimi)
It's clear that you're upset with me
Finally found a girl that you couldn't impress
Last man on the earth, still couldn't get this
You're delusional, you're delusional
(He's all up in my George Foreman)
Boy, you're losing your mind
It's confusing, yo, you're confused, you know?
Why you wasting your time?
Got you all fired up with your Napoleon complex
Seeing right through you like you're bathing in Windex
(You love me, you love me, you really, really love me)[Verse 1]
Oh, when you walk by every night
Talking sweet and looking fine
I get kind of hectic inside
Mmm, baby, I'm so into you
Darling, if you only knew
All the things that flow through my mind

[Chorus]
But it's just a sweet, sweet fantasy, baby
When I close my eyes, you come and take me
On and on and on, it's so deep in my daydreams
But it's just a sweet, sweet fantasy, baby (Fantasy)
(And I want you so bad)

[Verse 2]
Images of rapture
Creep into me slowly
As you're going to my head
And my heart beats faster
When you take me over
Time and time and time again

[Chorus]
But it's just a sweet, sweet fantasy, baby
When I close my eyes, you come and take me
On and on and on, it's so deep in my daydreams
But it's just a sweet, sweet fantasy, baby (Fantasy)
Oh, oh, it's just a sweet, sweet fantasy, baby
When I close my eyes you come and take me
On and on and on, it's so deep in my daydreams
But it's just a sweet, sweet fantasy, baby (Fantasy)

I'm in heaven
With my boyfriend, my laughing boyfriend
There's no beginning and there is no end
Feels like I'm dreaming, but I'm not sleeping

[Chorus]
Oh, it's just a sweet, sweet fantasy, baby
When I close my eyes, you come and take me
On and on and on, it's so deep in my daydreams
But it's just a sweet, sweet fantasy, baby
Sweet, sweet fantasy, baby
When I close my eyes, you come and take me
On and on and on, it's so deep in my daydreams
But it's just a sweet, sweet fantasy, baby
Sweet, sweet fantasy, baby
Sweet, sweet fantasy, baby[Verse 1]
We were as one, babe
For a moment in time
And it seemed everlasting
That you would always be mine
Now you want to be free
So I'll let you fly
'Cause I know in my heart, babe
Our love will never die, no

[Chorus]
You'll always be a part of me
I'm part of you indefinitely
Boy, don't you know you can't escape me?
Ooh, darling, 'cause you'll always be my baby
And we'll linger on
Time can't erase a feeling this strong
No way you're never gonna shake me
Ooh, darling, 'cause you'll always be my baby

[Verse 2]
I ain't gonna cry, no
And I won't beg you to stay
If you're determined to leave, boy
I will not stand in your way
But inevitably
You'll be back again
'Cause you know in your heart, babe
Our love will never end, no

[Chorus]
You'll always be a part of me
I'm part of you indefinitely
Boy, don't you know you can't escape me?
Ooh, darling, 'cause you'll always be my baby
And we'll linger on
Time can't erase a feeling this strong
No way you're never gonna shake me
Ooh, darling, 'cause you'll always be my baby

[Bridge]
I know that you'll be back, boy
When your days and your nights get a little bit colder, oh
I know that you'll be right back, baby
Oh, baby, believe me, it's only a matter of time, time

[Chorus]
You'll always be a part of me
I'm part of you indefinitely
Boy, don't you know you can't escape me?
Ooh, darling, 'cause you'll always be my baby
And we'll linger on (And we will linger on and on)
Time can't erase a feeling this strong
No way you're never gonna shake me (Ooh baby)
Ooh, darling, 'cause you'll always be my baby
You'll always be a part of me
I'm part of you indefinitely
Boy, don't you know you can't escape me?
Ooh, darling, 'cause you'll always be my baby

Time can't erase a feeling this strong (You and I)
No way you're never going to shake me (you and I)
Ooh, darling, 'cause you'll always be my baby

[Outro]
You and I will always be
No way you're never gonna shake me
No way you're never gonna shake me
You and I - we'll always be[Intro]
How 'bout you?
How 'bout you?

[Verse 1]
You took my love for granted
You left me lost and disenchanted
Bulldozed my heart as if you planned it
My prince was so unjustly handsome

[Pre-Chorus]
Who was that knight in shining armor?
I could've sworn you'd love me harder
Might as well down this Caymus bottle
I ain't the type to play the martyr

[Chorus]
How 'bout you get the fuck out?
How 'bout you get the fuck out?
Get the fuck out
(How 'bout you)
Take your tings and be on your merry way
Fly off with the wind, bye bye baby
(How 'bout you)
Scusa mi, Mimi call you a valet
(You just) take your tings and be on your merry way

[Verse 2]
My friends all saw it in your eyes
They told me once, they told me twice
I looked beyond all the signs
I guess false love makes you blind, ay

[Pre-Chorus]
Who was that knight in shining armor?
(You, you, you)
I could've sworn you'd love me harder
(You, you, you)
Might as well down this Caymus bottle
(You, you, you)
I ain't the type to play the martyr

[Chorus]
How 'bout you get the fuck out? (How about)
How 'bout you get the fuck out?
How about you get the fuck out?
(How 'bout you)
Take your tings and be on your merry way
(How 'bout you)
Fly off with the wind, bye bye, baby
(How 'bout you)
Scusa mi, Mimi call you a valet
(How 'bout you)
Take your tings and be on your merry way
How 'bout you get the fuck out?
(Fuck out, fuck out)

[Hook]
(Get the fuck out)
Stop telling me these lies when you're bluffing
How 'bout you get the fuck out?
Go stay at your friend's house or something
Don't mean to be rude, but take your shit and leave
(How 'bout you)
Go stay at your friend's house or something
(How 'bout you)
Go stay with your homeboys you was talking to
(How 'bout you)
I ain't tryna be rude, but you're lucky
(How 'bout you)
I ain't kick your ass out last weekend

[Outro]
(How 'bout you)
Take your tings and be on your merry way
(How 'bout you)
Fly off with the wind, bye bye, baby[Intro]
Uh-huh
Yeah, yeah, yeah, ooh
With you
With you, you, you
With you, you, you
With you, you, you
Mustard on that beat, ho

[Verse 1]
It was all so overwhelming
She was like, "I don't know, don't tell me"
He had eyes that said, "Girl, I'll save you"
She had doubts, like they might not make it
So they both held tight to face it
There were vows, she was bound to take 'em
She was full of such trepidation
There in front of the whole damn nation

[Pre-Chorus]
It was war, can't predict the comin' storm
Promise that you'll keep me warm
I don't wanna play this wrong
He said, "Yo, I've been lovin' you so long
Ever since that Bone Thugs song
You ain't gotta break down, you're too strong"

[Chorus]
Ooh, shots of Remy
Playing Confessions, and our bodies blendin'
Ooh, I'm in love, it's true
Yeah, damn I fucks with you
And we all make mistakes sometimes
But we muddle through
I don't know what I'm supposed to do (Boy)
Oh baby, I'm in love, it's true
With you, you, you
With you, you, you
With you, you, you
Baby, I'm in love, it's true

[Verse 2]
Waves were breakin' on that shore
As we were sneakin' through that door
Had to leave by half past four
Still I yearned to touch you more and more

[Pre-Chorus]
It was war, can't predict the comin' storm
Promise that you'll keep me warm
I don't wanna play this wrong
He said, "Yo, I've been lovin' you so long
Ever since that Bone Thugs song
You ain't gotta break down, you're too strong"

[Chorus]
Ooh, shots of Remy
Playing Confessions, and our bodies blendin'
Ooh, I'm in love, it's true
Yeah, damn I fucks with you (You, you)
And we all make mistakes sometimes
But we muddle through
I don't know what I'm s'posed to do (Boy)
Oh baby, I'm in love, it's true
And ooh, shots of Remy
Playing Confessions, and our bodies blendin'
Ooh, I'm in love, it's true
Yeah, damn I fucks with you (Aye)
And we all make mistakes sometimes
But we muddle through
I don't know what I'm s'posed to do (boy)
Oh baby, I'm in love, it's true
With you, you, you
(With you, with you, with you, with you)
With you, you, you (Oh yeah)
With you, you, you (Oh yeah, yeah)
Oh baby, baby, I'm in love, it's true[Intro: Ol' Dirty Bastard]

There's a hero
If you look inside your heart
You don't have to be afraid
Of what you are
Theres an answer
If you reach into your soul
And the sorrow that you know
Will melt away

[Chorus]
And then a hero comes along
With the strength to carry on
And you cast your fears aside
And you know you can survive
So when you feel like hope is gone
Look inside you and be strong
And you'll finally see the truth
That a hero lies in you

[Verse 2]
It's a long road
When you face the world alone
No one reaches out a hand for you to hold
You can find love
If you search within yourself
And the emptiness you felt
Will disappear

[Chorus]
And then a hero comes along
With the strength to carry on
And you cast your fears aside
And you know you can survive
So when you feel like hope is gone
Look inside you and be strong
And you'll finally see the truth
That a hero lies in you

[Bridge]
Lord knows
Dreams are hard to follow
But don't let anyone
Tear them away
Hold on
There will be tomorrow
In time
You'll find the way

[Chorus]
And then a hero comes along
With the strength to carry on
And you cast your fears aside
And you know you can survive
So when you feel like hope is gone
Look inside you and be strong
And you'll finally see the truth
That a hero lies in you

[Verse 1]
I know that you've been waiting for it, I'm waiting too
In my imagination, I'd be all up on you
I know you got that fever for me: hundred and two
And boy, I know I feel the same
My temperature's through the roof

[Pre-Chorus]
If there's a camera up in here
Then it's gonna leave with me when I do (I do)
If there's a camera up in here
Then I'd best not catch this flick on YouTube (YouTube)
'Cause if you run your mouth
And brag about this secret rendezvous
I will hunt you down
'Cause they be all up in my business like a Wendy interview
But this is private, between you and I

[Chorus]
Touch my body, put me on the floor
Wrestle me around, play with me some more
Touch my body, throw me on the bed
I just wanna make you feel like you never did
Touch my body, let me wrap my thighs
All around your waist, just a little taste
Touch my body, know you love my curves
Come on and give me what I deserve
And touch my body

[Verse 2]
Boy, you can put me on you like a brand new white tee
I'll hug your body tighter than my favorite jeans
I want you to caress me like a tropical breeze
And float away with you in the Caribbean Sea

[Pre-Chorus]
If there's a camera up in here
Then it's gonna leave with me when I do (I do)
If there's a camera up in here
Then I'd best not catch this flick on YouTube (YouTube)
'Cause if you run your mouth
And brag about this secret rendezvous
I will hunt you down
'Cause they be all up in my business like a Wendy Interview
But this is private, between you and I

Touch my body, put me on the floor
Wrestle me around, play with me some more
Touch my body, throw me on the bed

Touch my body, let me wrap my thighs
All around your waist, just a little taste
Touch my body, know you love my curves
Come on and give me what I deserve
And touch my body

[Bridge]
I'ma treat you like a teddy bear
You won't wanna go nowhere
In the lap of luxury
Laying intertwined with me
You won't want for nothing, boy (No)
I will give you plenty joy (Oh, touch my body!)

[Chorus]
Touch my body, put me on the floor (Throw me on the floor)
Wrestle me around, play with me some more
(Ooh, touch my body) Touch my body, throw me on the bed
I just wanna make you feel like you never did
Touch my body, let me wrap my thighs (Let me wrap my thighs)
All around your waist, just a little taste (Around your waist, for just a little taste)
Touch my body, know you love my curves (I know you like it)
Come on and give me what I deserve (Give me what I deserve, babe!)
And touch my body

Touch my body[Verse 1: Boyz II Men]
Sorry I never told you
All I wanted to say
And now it's too late to hold you
'Cause you've flown away, so far away

[Verse 2: Mariah Carey]
Never had I imagined
Living without your smile
Feeling and knowing you hear me
It keeps me alive, alive

[Chorus: All & Mariah Carey]
And I know you're shining down on me from Heaven
Like so many friends we've lost along the way
And I know eventually we'll be together (Together)
One sweet day
(And I'll wait patiently to see you in heaven)

[Verse 3: Boyz II Men & (Mariah Carey)]
Darling, I never showed you (No, no, no, no)
Assumed you'd always be there (Always there)
I thought you'd always be there
I, I took your presence for granted
But I always cared (But I always cared)
And I miss the love we shared (Yeah, and I know)

[Chorus: All, Mariah Carey]
And I know you're shining down on me from Heaven
Like so many friends we've lost along the way (Lost along the way)
And I know eventually we'll be together (Oh, no, I know)
One sweet day
(And I'll wait patiently to see you in heaven)

[Bridge: Mariah Carey & (Boyz II Men)]
(Although the sun will never shine the same again)
(I'll always look to a brighter day) Yeah, yeah
Lord, I know when I lay me down to sleep
You will always listen as I pray

[Chorus: All]
And I know you're shining down on me from Heaven
Like so many friends we've lost along the way
And I know eventually we'll be together
One sweet day (One sweet day)
And I know you're shining down on me from Heaven
Like so many friends we've lost along the way
And I know eventually we'll be together (Yes, we will)

Sorry, I never told you
All I wanted to say[Intro: Jay-Z & Mariah Carey]
Yeah
We're gonna do it like this
Alright, let's go
Give me your love, give me your love
Ugh, what, ugh, Jigga, MC, ha, Clue?
Give me your love, give me your love
Hey, you gotta bounce to this like this
Give me your love, give me your love
You almost gotta watch to this, uh-huh, ooh wee!
Give me your love, give me your love
Escape

[Verse 1: Mariah Carey & DJ Clue?]
Oh, your love's so good, I don't wanna let go
And although I should, I can't leave you alone (Ha-ha!)
'Cause you're so disarming
I'm caught up in the midst of you
And I cannot resist at all (Sing the song!)

[Pre-Chorus: Mariah Carey]
Boy, if I do the things you want me to
The way I used to do
Would you love me, baby?
Or leaving me feeling used
Would you go and break my heart?

[Chorus: Mariah Carey]
Heartbreaker, you've got the best of me
But I just keep on coming back incessantly
Oh, why did you have to run your game on me?
I should have known right from the start
You'd go and break my heart

[Post-Chorus: Mariah Carey & Jay-Z]
Give me your love
Give me your love
Give me your love
Give me your love (Uh-huh)
Give me your love
Give me your love
Give me your love
Give me your love
Give me your love
Give me your love
Give me your love (She said)
Give me your love
Give me your love
Give me your love
Give me your love
Give me your love (Uh-huh)
(Get him back)

[Verse 2: Mariah Carey]
It's a shame to be so euphoric and weak
When you smile at me and you tell me the things
That you know persuades me to relinquish my love to you
But I cannot resist at all

[Pre-Chorus: Mariah Carey]
Boy, if I do the things you want me to
The way I used to do
Would you love me, baby?
Or leaving me feeling used
Would you go and break my heart?

[Chorus: Mariah Carey]
Heartbreaker, you've got the best of me
But I just keep on coming back incessantly
Oh, why did you have to run your game on me?
I should have known right from the start
You'd go and break my heart

[Interlude: Jay-Z]
I'm all on the record
Okay, Clue, alright

[Verse 3: Jay-Z]
She wanna shop with Jay, play box with Jay
She wanna pillow fight in the middle of the night
She wanna drive my Benz with five of her friends
She wanna creep past the block, spying again
She wanna roll with Jay, chase skee-os away
She wanna fight with lame chicks, blow my date
She wanna inspect the rest, kick me to the curb
If she find one strand of hair longer than hers
She want love in the jacuzzi, rub up in the movies
Access to the old crib, keys to the newbie
She wanna answer the phone, tattoo her arm
That's when I gotta send her back to her moms
She calls me heartbreaker, when we apart it makes her
Want a piece of paper, scribble down "I hate ya"
But she knows she loves Jay because
She loves everything Jay say, Jay does and ugh!

[Chorus: Mariah Carey]
Heartbreaker, you've got the best of me
But I just keep on coming back incessantly
Oh, why did you have to run your game on me?
I should have known right from the start
You'd go and break my heart
Heartbreaker, you've got the best of me
But I just keep on coming back incessantly
Oh, why did you have to run your game on me?
I should have known right from the start
You'd go and break my heart
Heartbreaker, you've got the best of me
But I just keep on coming back incessantly
Oh, why did you have to run your game on me?
I should have known right from the start
You'd go and break my heart
Heartbreaker, you've got the best of me
But I just keep on coming back incessantly
Oh, why did you have to run your game on me?
I should have known right from the start
You'd go and break my heart

[Outro: Mariah Carey & DJ Clue?]
Give me your love, give me your love
Give me your love, give me your love
MC, break it down
Ha, ha
X-streak, it's a rap[Intro: Mariah Carey]
Uh, whoa, whoa
ReRe's got a new boyfriend (yeah, uh-uh)

[Hook: Mariah Carey]
I wanna, I wanna, I wanna, I wanna
I need a, I need a, I need a, I need a
I lover, lover, I lover, lover
A lover, a lover, a lover, a loverboy

[Verse 1: Mariah Carey]
I got myself a lover
Who knows what I like
When he invites me over
I come every time
And when my sugar daddy
Takes me for a ride
Whatever way we go
It's delirium time

[Pre-Chorus: Mariah Carey]
He's all mine
And his lovin' makes me high
Like a taste of ecstasy
All I need is him to be my loverboy

[Chorus: Mariah Carey]
Loverboy c'mon and love me
Give me more, touch me and touch me
I enjoy the way you rock me
All night long
Loverboy c'mon and take me
Only you know how to make me
Shudder with anticipation
All night long

[Verse 2: Mariah Carey]
I got myself a lover
And he's so sublime
It's quite a bit of heaven
To feel him inside
Cause when my sugar daddy
Takes me for a ride
Whatever way we go
It's delirium time
I get weak
When his candy kisses sweetly
Caress my whole body
All I need is him to be
My loverboy

[Chorus: Mariah Carey]
Loverboy c'mon and love me
Give me more, touch me and touch me
I enjoy the way you rock me
All night long
Loverboy c'mon and take me
Only you know how to make me
Shudder with anticipation
All night long

[Verse 3: Cameo]
This stuff is starting now
This stuff is starting now
It's the same feeling
I always seem to get around you (yes, I do)
'Cause you affect me, you fascinate me
I thank heaven for the things that you do, oh
This stuff is starting now, oh
This stuff is starting now
This stuff is starting now, ooh
My eyes roll in my head
I toss and turn in my bed
In the morning when I think about you (Candy!)
Simply put, you're the reason why (you're the reason why)
Even though I'm real shy, it's like candy
I attempt to look my best for you, indeed I do, just for you

[Chorus: Mariah Carey & Cameo]
Loverboy, come on and love me
Give me more (give it to me), touch me and touch me
I enjoy the way you rock me all night long (all night long)
(Strawberry) Loverboy, come on and take me
(Raspberry) Only you know how to make me
(All those good things)
(Diamonds and gumdrops)
Shudder with anticipation all night long
(That's what you seem to me)
Loverboy, come on and love me (oh)
Give me more, touch me and touch me
(This stuff is starting, staring now)
I enjoy the way you rock me all night long
(Strawberry) Loverboy, come on and take me
(Raspberry) Only you know how to make me
(All those good things)
(Diamonds and gumdrops)
Shudder with anticipation all night long
(That's what you seem to me)
Loverboy, come on and love me (oh)
Give me more, touch me and touch me (baby)
I enjoy the way you rock me...[Chorus]
You've got me feeling emotions
Deeper than I've ever dreamed of
You've got me feeling emotions
Higher than the heavens above

[Verse 1]
I feel good, I feel nice
I've never felt so satisfied
I'm in love, I'm alive
Intoxicated, flying high

[Pre-Chorus]
It feels like a dream
When you touch me tenderly
I don't know if it's real
But I like the way I feel inside

[Chorus]
You've got me feeling emotions
Deeper than I've ever dreamed of
You've got me feeling emotions
Higher than the heavens above

[Verse 2]
In the morning when I rise
You are the first thing on my mind
And in the middle of the night
I feel your heartbeat next to mine

[Pre-Chorus]
It feels like a dream
When you love me tenderly
I don't know if you're for real
But I like the way I feel inside

[Chorus]
You've got me feeling emotions
Deeper than I've ever dreamed of
You've got me feeling emotions
Higher than the heavens above
Oh, you've got me feeling emotions
Deeper than I've ever dreamed of
Oh baby, you've got me feeling emotions
Higher than the heavens above

[Bridge]
Oh, you know the way to make me lose control
When you're looking into my eyes
You make me feel so high
Oh, oh, baby (Oh, baby)
Eh, alright (Alright)
Ahh, yeah
Ooh, ooh, hey, hey
Whoa, oh, oh

[Chorus]
You've got me feeling emotions
Deeper than I've ever dreamed of
Oh, you've got me feeling emotions (Emotions)
Higher than the heavens above

[Outro]
Oh yeah, you've got me feeling emotions, yes, you do
Oh yeah, you've got me feeling emotions, yeah
Higher, emotions
Deeper than I've ever dreamed of
Whoa, oh, you, emotions (Emotions), ooh

[Verse 1: Mariah Carey & (Styles P)]
Oh honey, you can have me when you want me
If you simply ask me to be there (Uh huh)
And you're the only one who makes me come runnin'
'Cause what you got is far beyond compare, oh

[Pre-Chorus: Mariah Carey & (Styles P)]
And it's just like honey
When your love comes over me (That's right)
Oh baby, I've got a dependency
Always strung out for another taste of your honey

[Chorus: Mariah Carey]
It's like honey when it rushes over me
You know sugar never ever was so sweet
And I'm dyin' for ya, cryin' for ya, I adore ya
One hit of your love addicted me
Now I'm strung out on you, darlin', don't you see?
Every night and day
I can hardly wait for another taste of honey

[Post-Chorus: Mariah Carey]
Honey, I can't describe how good it feels inside
Honey, I can't describe how good it feels inside

[Verse 2: Mariah Carey & (Styles P)]
I can't be elusive with you, honey (I like that)
'Cause it's blatant that I'm feelin' you (yeah)
And it's too hard for me to leave abruptly
'Cause you're the only thing I wanna do

[Pre-Chorus: Mariah Carey]
And it's just like honey
When your love comes over me
Oh baby, I've got a dependency
Always strung out for another taste of your honey (honey)

[Chorus: Mariah Carey]
It's like honey when it rushes over me
You know sugar never ever was so sweet
And I'm dyin' for ya, cryin' for ya, I adore ya (I need you bad)
One hit of your love addicted me (Ooh, your love addicted me)
Now I'm strung out on you, darlin', don't you see?  (I can't wait for another)
Every night and day
I can hardly wait for another taste of honey

(Baby, I can hardly wait)
Honey I can't describe
Harlem world, we won't stop
And Mariah, you're on fire
How good it feels inside (Gotta have another taste)
Harlem world, we won't stop
So Mariah, take us higher
Honey I can't describe (I gotta have you now, come on baby)
Harlem world, we won't stop (I need your honey right now)
How good it feels inside
And Mariah, you're on fire
Harlem world, we won't stop
So Mariah, take us higher (Come sweet to me with your honey)

(Breakdown)
Whoa, whoa, every little thing you do

Oh, oh, honey, got me hooked on you
(MC, and she won't stop)
Honey, it's like

[Chorus: Mariah Carey]
It's like honey when it rushes over me

One hit of your love addicted me
Now I'm strung out on you, darlin', don't you see?

It's like honey when it rushes over me
You know sugar never ever was so sweet

[Chorus]
(I gotta shake you off)
'Cause the loving ain't the same and you keep on playing games
Like you know I'm here to stay
(I gotta shake, shake you off)
Just like the Calgon commercial, I
Really gotta get up outta here
And go somewhere
(I gotta shake you off)
Gotta make that move
Find somebody who
Appreciates all the love I give
Boy, I gotta (Shake, shake you off)
Gotta do what's best for me
Baby, and that means I gotta
(Shake you off)

[Verse 1]
By the time you get this message, it's gonna be too late
So don't bother paging me 'cause I'll be on my way
See, I grabbed all my diamonds and clothes
Just ask your momma she knows
You're gonna miss me, baby
Hate to say I told you so
Well, at first I didn't know, but now it's clear to me
You would cheat with all your freaks and lie compulsively
So I packed up my Louis Vuitton
Jumped in your ride and took off
You'll never ever find a girl who loves you more than me

[Chorus]
(I gotta shake you off)
'Cause the loving ain't the same and you keep on playing games
Like you know I'm here to stay
(I gotta shake, shake you off)
Just like the Calgon commercial, I
Really gotta get up outta here
And go somewhere

Gotta make that move
Find somebody who
Appreciates all the love I give

Shake, shake, shake, shake, shake it off
Shake, shake, shake, shake, shake it off

[Verse 2]
I found out about a gang of your dirty little deeds
With this one and that one by the pool
On the beach, in the streets
Heard y'all was
Hold up my phone's breakin' up
I'mma hang up and call the machine right back
I gotta get this off of my mind
You wasn't worth my time
So I'm leaving you behind
Yeah, 'cause I need a real love in my life
Save this recording because
I'm never coming back home
Baby, I'm gone, don't ya know?

[Chorus]
(I gotta shake you off)
'Cause the loving ain't the same and you keep on playing games
Like you know I'm here to stay

Gotta make that move
Find somebody who

I gotta shake you off[Verse 1]
No, I can't forget this evening
Or your face as you were leaving
But I guess that's just the way the story goes
You always smile, but in your eyes, your sorrow shows
Yes, it shows
No, I can't forget tomorrow
When I think of all my sorrow
When I had you there, but then I let you go
And now it's only fair that I should let you know
What you should know

[Chorus]
I can't live
If living is without you
I can't live
I can't give anymore
I can't live
If living is without you
I can't give
I can't give anymore

[Verse 2]
Well, I can't forget this evening
Or your face as you were leaving
But I guess that's just the way the story goes
You always smile, but in your eyes, your sorrow show
Yes, it shows

[Chorus]
I can't live
If living is without you
I can't live
I can't give anymore
I can't live
If living is without you
I can't live
I can't give anymore
(No, can't live)
(No, I can't live)
No, no, no, no, hey
I can't live (No, can't live)
If living is without you (No, I can't live)
I can't live
I can't give anymore
Can't live (No, can't live, no, I can't live)[Hook: Mariah]
Get 'em, get 'em, get 'em (go)
Hit 'em, hit 'em, hit 'em (go)
Get 'em, get 'em, get 'em (go)
Hit 'em, hit 'em, hit 'em (go)
Get 'em, get 'em, get 'em (go)
Hit 'em, hit 'em, hit 'em (go)

[Verse 1: Meek Mill]
They told me get 'em, I got 'em
I swear this word to my father
And the only way to make it to the top
If you go and get it from the bottom
And I have never asked for no hand outs
You wont carry me, no Mariah
These haters love when I was dead broke
But they are not mad at me
Im on fire and Im going to burn
And I am not going to learn
I remember they said that it is not my turn
But it is not confirmed, then the tables turned
Just look at me now, try to hold me down
But I am not going to stop, because Im going to climb
To the mountain top, to the mountain top, now let go

[Chorus: Mariah]
Cant fall down, stay triumphant, keep on living
Stay on your toes, get off the ropes
Dont let them ever count you out
Realize all things are possible
In your heart whos the greatest
Reach for the stars, be all that you are
And make them all fall down

[Verse 2: Rick Ross]
Path that I chose flashing cameras as I pose
Throwing big money as she dances on the pole
Lime green Lamborghini dances in the road
License still suspended, no I never stop for tolls
Born slick talker, twice a week shopper
Blow a hundred racks she dont know a footlocker
Red bottom boss house big as Baltimore
With a blonde bombshell trying to bomb with your boy
In the James Bond Beamer chrome wheel two seater
Smoking like Pimp C, spoken like a trill nigga
On a cloudy day baby I can make it rain
Rubber band, 50 grand bet it brighten up your day
Came from humble beginnings
Then was Hummers and Benzes
Now its hundred and millions this is only the beginning
A don, a diva, the bomb achiever
The one believer, the game gets deeper

[Chorus: Mariah]
Cant fall down stay triumphant, keep on living
Stay on your toes, get off the ropes
Dont let them ever count you out
Realize all things are possible
In your heart whos the greatest
Reach for the stars, be all that you are
And make them all fall down

[Hook: Mariah]
(They told me to get 'em, I got 'em)
Get 'em, get 'em, get 'em (go)
Hit 'em, hit 'em, hit 'em (go)
(They told me to get 'em, I got 'em)
Get 'em, get 'em, get 'em (go)
Hit 'em, hit 'em, hit 'em (go)
(They told me to get 'em, I got 'em)
Get 'em, get 'em, get 'em (go)
Hit 'em, hit 'em, hit 'em (go)
(They told me to get 'em, I got 'em)
Get 'em, get 'em, get 'em (go)
Hit 'em, hit 'em, hit 'em (go)

[Bridge: Mariah]
Cant fall down now, so even when clouds surround you
And everyone seems to doubt you
Baby, still know who you are
So you got to keep on climbing
In spite of the chains that bind you
You can see the mountain top
Its not too far

[Chorus: Mariah]
Cant fall down, stay triumphant, keep on living
Stay on your toe, get off the ropes
Dont let them ever count you out
Realize all things are possible
In your heart whos the greatest
Reach for the stars, be all that you are
And make them all fall down
Cant fall down, stay triumphant, keep on living
Stay on your toe, get off the ropes
Dont let them ever count you out
Realize all things are possible
In your heart whos the greatest
Reach for the stars, be all that you are
And make them all fall down

Break, breakdown
Steady breaking me on down
Break, breakdown
Steady breaking me on down
Break, breakdown
Steady breaking me on down
Break, breakdown
Steady breaking me on down

[Verse 1: Mariah Carey]
You called yesterday
To basically say
That you care for me but
That you're just not in love
Immediately I pretended to be feeling similarly
And led you to believe I was OK
To just walk away from the one thing
That's unyielding and sacred to me

[Chorus: Mariah Carey]
Well, I guess I'm trying to be nonchalant about it
And I'm going to extremes to prove I'm fine without you
But in reality, I'm slowly losing my mind
Underneath the guise of smile, gradually I'm dying inside
Friends ask me how I feel and I lie convincingly
'Cause I don't want to reveal the fact that I'm suffering
So I wear my disguise 'til I go home at night
Then turn down all the lights and then I breakdown and cry

[Verse 2: Mariah Carey]
So what do you do when somebody you're so devoted to
Suddenly just stops loving you
And it seems they haven't got a clue
Of the pain that rejection is putting you through?
Do you cling to your pride and sing "I Will Survive"?
Do you lash out and say: "How dare you leave this way"?
Do you hold on in vain as they just slip away?

[Chorus: Mariah Carey]
Well, I guess I'm trying to be nonchalant about it
And I'm going to extremes to prove I'm fine without you
But in reality, I'm slowly losing my mind
(Losing my mind, losing my mind)
Underneath the guise of smile, gradually I'm dying inside
Friends ask me how I feel (how dare you leave?)
And I lie convincingly
'Cause I don't want to reveal the fact that I'm suffering
So I wear my disguise 'till I go home at night
Then turn down all the lights and then I breakdown and cry
I'm gonna breakdown

[Verse 3: Krayzie Bone & (Wish Bone)]
Break break down, steady breakin' me on down
Break break down, steady breakin' me on down
(It'll break ya down, only if you let it
Every day crazy situation's rockin' my mind
Tryin' to break me down, but I won't let it, forget it)
I been feeling like your breaking me down
Kicking me around, stressing me out
I think you better go and get out
And let me release some stress, stress
(Don't ever wanna feel no pain, pain
Hoping for the sun but it looks like rain, rain, rain, rain
Lord, I just wanna maintain)
Yeah, I'm feeling pressures you all
But nevertheless Krayzie won't fall
It's over, it's ending here, here

[Chorus: Mariah Carey]
Well, I guess I'm trying to be nonchalant about it
And I'm going to extremes to prove I'm fine without you
But in reality, I'm slowly losing my mind
(Slowing dying inside in my heart, just cry)
Underneath the guise of smile, gradually I'm dying inside
Friends ask me how I feel (How do I feel?)
And I lie convincingly
(I'm losing my mind!)
'Cause I don't wanna reveal the fact that I'm suffering
So I wear my disguise 'till I go home at night
Then turn down all the lights and then I breakdown and cry

Well, I guess I'm trying to be nonchalant about it
And I'm going to extremes to prove I'm fine without you
But in reality, I'm slowly losing my mind
Underneath the guise of smile, gradually I'm dying inside
Friends ask me how I feel (how I feel)
And I lie convincingly
'Cause I don't wanna reveal the fact that I'm suffering
So I wear my disguise 'till I go home at night
Then turn down all the lights and then I breakdown and cry

Well, I guess I'm trying to be nonchalant about it
(Cry, cry, cry)
And I'm going to extremes to prove I'm fine without you
But in reality I'm slowly losing my mind
Underneath the guise of smile, gradually I'm dying inside
Friends ask me how I feel and I lie convincingly
(How do I feel?! What do you think?
You gotta know I'm suffering)
'Cause I don't wanna reveal the fact that I'm suffering
So I wear my disguise 'till I go home at night
Then turn down all the lights and then I breakdown and cry

Well, I guess I'm trying to be nonchalant about it
(Cry, cry, cry)
And I'm going to extremes to prove I'm fine without you
But in reality I'm slowly losing my mind
(Cry, cry, cry, cry)
Underneath the guise of smile, gradually I'm dying inside
Friends ask me how I feel and I lie convincingly
(Cry, cry, cry, cry)
'Cause I don't wanna reveal the fact that I'm suffering
So I wear my disguise 'till I go home at night
(Cry, cry)
Then turn down all the lights and then I breakdown and cry[Verse 1]
I am thinking of you
In my sleepless solitude tonight
If it's wrong to love you
Then my heart just won't let me be right
'Cause I've drowned in you
And I won't pull through
Without you by my side

[Chorus]
I'd give my all to have
Just one more night with you
I'd risk my life to feel
Your body next to mine
'Cause I can't go on
Living in the memory of our song
I'd give my all for your love tonight

[Verse 2]
Baby, can you feel me?
Imagining I'm looking in your eyes
I can see you clearly
Vividly emblazoned in my mind
And yet you're so far, like a distant star
I'm wishing on tonight

[Chorus]
I'd give my all to have
Just one more night with you
I'd risk my life to feel
Your body next to mine
'Cause I can't go on
Living in the memory of our song
I'd give my all for your love tonight

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
I'd give my all to have
Just one more night with you
I'd risk my life to feel
Your body next to mine
'Cause I can't go on
Living in the memory of our song
I'd give my all for your love tonight

[Outro]
Give my all for your love
Tonight[Verse 1]
Why you mad? Talkin' 'bout you're mad
Could it be that you just lost the best you've ever had?
Thats your bag, yup, thats too bad
Show is over, you aint gotta act
Name hold weight like kilos
Boy, you actin' so corny like Fritos
Wouldnt have none of that without me though
Aint none of my business, it's tea though
Outta ammo, gotta reload
If life was a game, you're a free throw
It's nothing that you dont already know

[Chorus]
Close the door, lose the key
Leave my heart on the mat for me
I was yours eternally
Theres an end to infinity
To infinity
To infinity

[Verse 2]
How I say this? Fact that you still exist
No disrespect, no second thought it truly, truly is
Truthfully Im through with this
Why are we still doing this?
Answer the phone like, "Who is this?"
Take your head and knock some sense
Je ne comprends pas
Aint no compliments (duh)
Aint no being friends (duh)
Aint no false pretense (duh)
Aint no make amends (duh)
Aint no come against (duh)
Thats the story, aint no happy ends

[Chorus]
Close the door, lose the key
Leave my heart on the mat for me
I was yours eternally
Theres an end to infinity
To infinity
To infinity

Is it lack of ice got you so cold?
Have you ever felt this on your own?
Why you tryin' to play like youre so grown?
Everything you own, boy, you still owe

[Chorus]
Close the door, lose the key
Leave my heart on the mat for me
I was yours eternally
Theres an end to infinity
To infinity
To infinity

[Outro]
You're leaving, you're leaving, you're out the door
Infinity loving me more and more
You're leaving, you're leaving, you're out the door
Infinity loving me more and more
'Cause I believe infinity is more than just a made up dream
I believe infinity is more than just a made up dream[Verse 1]
I ain't even mad, no, not like befo'
Off with your head, now slither out the door
Snakes in the grass, it's time to cut the lawn
Ed Scissorhands, AKA "I cut you off" (No)
You ain't gonna lie to my face no mo'
Hit me with 'I'm sorry', but I'm sorry, (No)
Na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na, (No)
Get me Ed Shapiro on the phone
Case closed

[Pre-Chorus]
You shoulda known that it's bigger than you
You'll never know what I already knew
After everything I already been through
I can't waste no time, pay no 'tention to you

[Chorus]
I said no
No, no, no
A no-no
No, no
That's a no-no
No, no
I said no-no
No, no

[Verse 2]
You came so close, you just don't know
Irregardless of what transpired
It ain't even worthy of a slick reply
Even if I was the last woman alive
I would be like Ginger, you ain't Gilligan
I really don't care, I'm in love with the island
Rockin' Dior 'cause it goes with my diamonds
Got a pink gown Custom by Alaia
I'll be on stage when the stadium light up

[Pre-Chorus]
You shoulda' known that it's bigger than you
You'll never know what I already knew
After everything I already been through
I can't waste no time, pay no 'tention to you

[Chorus]
I said no
No, no, no
A no-no
No, no
That's a no-no
No, no
I said no-no
No, no
I said no
(I said no)
A no-no
No, no
That's a no-no
No, no, I said no-no
No, no
No

He's a slut, he's a hoe, he's a freak
Got a different girl every day of the week (Check it)
He's a slut, he's a hoe, he's a freak
Got a different girl every day of the week (Check it)
He's a slut, he's a hoe, he's a freak
Got a different girl every day of the week (Check it)

Yep[Intro]
(Don't forget about us)
Don't baby, don't baby, don't let it go
No baby, no baby, no baby, no
(Don't forget about us)
Don't baby, don't baby, don't let it go
My baby boy

[Verse 1]
Just let it die with no goodbyes
Details don't matter, we both paid the price
Tears in my eyes
You know sometimes it'd be like that, baby

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Now every time I see you, I pretend I'm fine
When I wanna reach out to you
But I turn and I walk and I let it ride
Baby, I must confess
We were bigger than anything
Remember us at our best
And don't forget about

[Chorus]
Late nights, playing in the dark
And waking up inside my arms
Boy, you'll always be in my heart and
I can see it in your eyes, you still want it
So don't forget about us
I'm just speaking from experience
Nothing can compare to your first true love
So I hope this will remind you
When it's for real, it's forever
So don't forget about us

[Verse 2]
Oh, they say that you're in a new relationship
But we both know nothing comes close to
What we had, it perseveres
That we both can't forget it
How good we used to get it

[Pre-Chorus 2]
There's only one me and you
And how we used to shine (We used to shine)
No matter who you go through
We are one, that's a fact that you can't deny
So, baby, we just can't let the fire pass us by
Forever we'd both regret
So don't forget about

[Chorus]
Late nights, playing in the dark
And waking up inside my arms
Boy, you'll always be in my heart and
I can see it in your eyes, you still want it
So don't forget about us
I'm just speaking from experience
Nothing can compare to your first true love
So I hope this will remind you
When it's for real, it's forever
So don't forget about us

[Bridge]
And if she's got your head all messed up now
That's the trickery
So why you act like you don't know how this loving used to be?
I bet she can't do it like me, she'll never be MC
Baby, don't you, don't you forget about us

[Chorus]
Late nights, playing in the dark
And waking up inside my arms
Boy, you'll always be in my heart and
I can see it in your eyes you still want it
So don't forget about us
I'm just speaking from experience
Nothing can compare to your first true love
So I hope this will remind you
When it's for real, it's forever
So don't forget about us
Late nights, playing in the dark
And waking up inside my arms
Boy, you'll always be in my heart and
I can see it in your eyes, you still want it
So don't forget about us
I'm just speaking from experience
Nothing can compare to your first true love
So I hope this will remind you, babe
When it's for real, it's forever
So don't forget about us

[Outro]
Don't baby, don't baby, don't let it go
No baby, no baby, no baby, no
(Don't forget about us)
Don't baby, don't baby, don't let it go
When it's for real, it's forever
So don't forget about us[Intro]
Ladies & Gentlemen!

[Hook: YG]
I know you love me
You just don't trust me
You don't understand me
But you love it when I call you Ms. Carey (I don't, I don't)
I know you love me
You just don't trust me
You need to understand me
But you love it when I call you Ms. Carey, yeah (I don't, I don't)

[Verse 1: Mariah Carey]
Somewhere in another life
We stole a moment in time
Gave you everything that you needed
I was even down to repeat it
Said you would always be mine
Feeding me nothing but lies
I was so gone, I admit it
Had me messed up for a minute

[Pre-Chorus: Mariah Carey]
But I'm tired of cryin', no more tears
Pity party of the year
Cold at night 'cause you're not here
Leaving you was my worst fear
I was caught up, I was blind
You kept playin' with my mind
Told you I'm finished, gassed up the whip and...
Rear view, bye

[Chorus: Mariah Carey]
'Cause when you love someone
You just don't treat them bad
You messed up all we had
Probably think I'm coming back
But I don't, I don't (I don't, I don't)
'Cause, boy, I was buggin'
Thinkin' somehow I could trust you
See, I used to love you
But I don't, I don't (I don't, I don't)
'Cause, boy, I was buggin'
Thinkin' somehow I could trust you
But you don't mean nothing
'Cause I don't, I don't (I don't, I don't)

[Verse 2]
I tried to make it work
No matter how much it hurt
You had to make it all about you
Tell me why you go and do me like you do?
I went from needing you
To walking right out on you
And now you all up in your feelings
Frontin' on me like your love was the realest

[Pre-Chorus: Mariah Carey]
And I'm tired of cryin', no more tears
Pity party of the year
Cold at night 'cause you're not here
Leaving you was my worst fear
I was caught up, I was blind
You kept playin' with my mind
Told you I'm finished, gassed up the whip and...
Rear view, bye

[Chorus: Mariah Carey]
'Cause when you love someone
You just don't treat them bad
You messed up all we had

'Cause boy I was buggin'
Thinkin' somehow I could trust you
See, I used to love you
But I don't, I don't (I don't, I don't)
'Cause boy I was buggin'
Thinkin' somehow I could trust you
But you don't mean nothing
'Cause I don't, I don't (I don't, I don't)

You just don't trust me (don't trust me)
You need to understand me
But you love it when I call you Ms. Carey, yeah

[Verse 3: YG]
Hold up, hold up, hold up, hold up
Hold up, I just got you ring, for what?
I put you in the game, now it's game over
Every time you went to the Louis store you got chauffeured
Hold up, how you gon' leave that?
Hold up, give me my ring back
Never mind, you can keep that
'Cause every time you look at your ring, me, you gon' dream that

[Hook: YG]
I know you love me
You just don't trust me
You don't understand me
But you love it when I call you Ms. Carey
I know you love me
You just don't trust me (don't trust me)
You need to understand me
But you love it when I call you Ms. Carey, yeah

[Chorus: Mariah Carey]
'Cause when you love someone
You just don't treat them bad
You messed up all we had
Probably think I'm coming back

S-P-I-R-I-T, it's great to see
We got it, the spirit
Hey, hey, let's hear it

[Verse 1: Mariah Carey]
Ain't nobody stopping us
What we have is dangerous
Left their opinions in the dust
Said can't nobody fuck with us
They'll never find a way to make us fade away
Our love won't fade away (No)
They'll never find a way to make us fade away
Our love won't fade away

[Pre-Chorus: Mariah Carey & Ty Dolla $ign]
Warm days, cold nights, late October
Separated, people saying what we have is over
But the hate only made us get closer (Close)
And closer

[Chorus: Mariah Carey & Ty Dolla $ign]
Said we couldn't go the distance, yeah
Look at us, we're going the distance
They just wanna be us
They don't wanna see us going the distance (Yeah)
For laughs, for laughs, la di da
Said we couldn't go the distance
For life, for life, la di da
Look at us, we're going the distance
The distance, oh

[Verse 2: Mariah Carey & Ty Dolla $ign]
There was no good, having hands out
Trying to diminish me
Boy we stayed up, camping out crowds
In spite of them difficulties
But they can't, but they can't, but they can't
Take away them precious memories (Yeah)
And I won't, and I won't, and I won't
Let 'em come between you and me (Woo)

[Pre-Chorus: Mariah Carey & Ty Dolla $ign]
Warm days, cold nights, late October
Separated, people saying what we have was over
But the hate, only made us get closer, (Close)

For laughs, for laughs la di da
Said we couldn't go the distance
For life, for life, la di da
Look at us, we're going the distance

We've been goin' all the way, ay
For the longest (Ooh yeah)
We too strong (Too strong)!
We're too solid (Ooh yeah)
They can't stop it now (Ooh)
We're a problem now? (Ooh)

[Outro]
S-P-I-R-I-T, it's great to see
We got it, the spirit
Hey, hey, let's hear it[Verse 1]
When you love someone so deeply
They become your life
It's easy to succumb to overwhelming fears inside
Blindly I imagined I could
Keep you under glass
Now I understand to hold you
I must open up my hands
And watch you rise

[Chorus]
Spread your wings and prepare to fly
For you have become a butterfly
Oh, fly abandonedly into the sun
If you should return to me
We truly were meant to be
So spread your wings and fly
Butterfly

[Verse 2]
I have learned that beauty
Has to flourish in the light
Wild horses run unbridled
Or their spirit dies
You have given me the courage
To be all that I can
And I truly feel your heart will
Lead you back to me when you're
Ready to land

[Chorus]
Spread your wings and prepare to fly
For you have become a butterfly
Oh, fly abandonedly into the sun
If you should return to me
We truly were meant to be
So spread your wings and fly
Butterfly

[Bridge]
I can't pretend these tears
Aren't overflowing steadily
I can't prevent this hurt from almost overtaking me
But I will stand and say goodbye
For you'll never be mine
Until you know the way it feels to fly

[Chorus]
Spread your wings and prepare to fly
For you have become a butterfly
Oh, fly abandonedly into the sun
If you should return to me (I will know you're mine)
We truly were meant to be
So spread your wings and fly, butterfly (My butterfly)
Spread your wings and prepare to fly
For you have become a butterfly
Oh, fly abandonedly into the sun
If you should return to me
We truly were meant to be
So spread your wings and fly
Butterfly (Fly)
So flutter through the sky
Butterfly
Fly
Spread your wings and fly

Nicki Minaj! (Minaj), hey-ey
You're such a Barbie!

[Verse 1: Nicki Minaj]
Yo, Mariah, I was in them million dollar meetings, he was cheatin'
All up in the church, he was sneaking with the deacon
Cats away, well, the mice'll play
LOL, smiley face, have a nicer day
'Cause pop, pop, pop, there goes my rubber band
So stop, stop, stop sniffing that contraband
'Cause you was penny pinching, my accounts laced
Attention! About face

[Verse 2: Mariah Carey]
I thought we had something special, like we had something good
But I shoulda had another mechanic under my hood
If you see me walking by you, boy, don't you even speak
Pretend you on the sofa and I'm on the TV
Might see me on a poster, see me at a show
But you won't see me for free, boy, this ain't no promo

[Bridge: Mariah Carey]
In all shame now (Shame now)
Where ever you been laying, you can stay now (Stay now)
Gotta board the BBJ and pull the shades down (Shades down)
I'm on the plane now
And don't keep calling from your mama's house

[Chorus]
When I break, I break, boy
Up out my face, boy (Up out my face)
Up out my face, boy (Up out my face)
Up out my face, boy (Up out my face)
When I break
Up out my face, boy (Up out my face)
Up out my face, boy (Up out my face)
Up out my face, boy (Up out my face)
When I break

[Verse 3: Mariah Carey & Nicki Minaj]
You ain't never gonna feel this thing again (Uh-uh)
You gon' get alot of calls 'cause I CC-ed all your friends
(When I break, I break)
I ain't walking 'round no more
Feeling sad, that ain't even my bag, baby
I break, when I break, I break
Mariah

[Verse 4: Mariah Carey]
So look who's crying now, boo-hoo-hoo
Talking 'bout you missing your boo, hoo-hoo
Oh no, you ain't gettin' it
I know you ain't hittin' it
No, you ain't a rapper, so you need to stop spittin' it
Ha ha, ha-ha-ha-ha-ha
You wondering who I'm messing while you ain't next to me
Go ha ha, ha-ha-ha-ha-ha
So pay the consequences 'cause you acted all ignorant

[Bridge: Mariah Carey & (Nicki Minaj)]
You ashamed now
Where ever you been laying, you can stay now
Gotta board the BBJ and pull the shades down
I'm on the plane now (Mmm-hmm)
And don't keep calling from your mama's house (Yo, yo)
When I break, I

[Verse 5: Nicki Minaj]
Yo, styling on them big B's, bought the Benz out
Elevator, press P for the penthouse
Top doe's, then we break like tacos
Roscoe's, on his knees with a snot-nose
They be like, "She next!", Kawasaki T-Rex
Give em' some Kleenex, match his little V-Necks (V-Necks)
Oh, that's what he left? Let his mama pick it up (Pick it up)
Might back up on it, VROOM VROOM, with the pick-up truck
That blue and yellow, yeah, that's the Carmelo Jag
I bob and weave em', hit em' wit that Mayweather jab
I get the thumbs up like I'm hailing a yellow cab
(Hailing a yellow cab)
My flow nuts like M&M's in the yellow bag (Mariah)

[Verse 6: Mariah Carey & Nicki Minaj]
When I break, I break, I break
And no super glue can fix this shit
When I break, I break, I break (Break on 'em, girl)
Not even a welder and a builder could rebuild this shit
When I break, I break, I break
Not even a nail technician with a whole lot of gel and acrylic
Can fix this when I break, I break
If we were two Lego blocks
Even the Harvard University graduating class of 2010
Couldn't put us back together again
When I break, boy
Up out my face, boy (Up out my face)
Up out my face, boy (Up out my face)
Up out my face, boy (Up out my face)
No, no, no (When I break, I break)
Up out my face, boy (Up out my face)
Up out my face, boy (Up out my face)
Up out my face, boy (Up out my face)

[Outro: Nicki Minaj & Mariah Carey]
Better go back to you mama's house
I told you, I put, I put his stuff on the sidewalk
I will roll over every nook and cranny with a pickup truck like
Like straight up and down
I am Nicki Minaj, can't say "ask about me"
Young Money
Up out my face, boy...[Verse]
O holy night
The stars are brightly shining
It is the night of our dear Savior's birth
Long lay the world
In sin and error pining
'Til He appeared and the soul felt its worth

[Chorus]
A thrill of hope
The weary world rejoices
For yonder breaks
A new and glorious morn
Fall on your knees
O hear the angels' voices
O night divine
O night when Christ was born
O night divine
O night
O night divine

[Chorus]
A thrill of hope
The weary world rejoices
For yonder breaks
A new and glorious morn
Fall on your knees
O hear the angels' voices
O night divine, yeah
O night when Christ was born
O night divine
O night divine (O night divine)
Ooh, yes it was (O night divine)
Oh, it is the night of our dear Savior's birth (O night divine)
Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah
Yeah, it is (O night divine)
It was a long night, long night, long night
Oh, oh, oh, woah, woah, woah, yes it was (O night divine)[Verse 1]
Never too late, you can come through
I'll be up waiting
I don't want nobody but you
No hesitating
'Cause every time you leave I fall apart
Boy you're the missing pieces of my heart

[Pre-Chorus]
And I try to let you go but you resist and pull me back
And I try to be alone but you persist, I've met my match

[Chorus]
Proceed with caution, don't be dishonest
I need you closer to love me harder
Proceed with caution, face to face
And touch me in a different kind of way
Proceed with caution, but don't make me wait
Before too long it just might fade away
Proceed with caution, caution, caution, caution, caution

[Verse 2]
Never get enough gimme your touch
Don't wanna waste time
You lift me up, give me that rush
Tell me it's all mine
I'll give up everything to be right where you are
I'll follow you from here like you're the northern star

[Pre-Chorus]
And I try to let you go but you resist and pull me back
And I try to be alone but you persist, I've met my match

[Chorus]
Proceed with caution, don't be dishonest
I need you closer to love me harder
Proceed with caution, face to face
And touch me in a different kind of way
Proceed with caution, but don't make me wait
Before too long it just might fade away
Proceed with caution, caution, caution, caution, caution

[Bridge]
Do you want more material possessions? Ain't nothing
Do you want more? Can you commit to be my everything?
Do you want more? Baby convince me with the words you sing
If you wanna be more to me, you must proceed with caution
Caution, caution, caution
Caution, caution, caution
Caution, caution, yeah
Proceed with caution

[Chorus]
Proceed with caution, don't be dishonest (Don't be dishonest)
I need you closer to love me harder (I need)

Proceed with caution, but don't make me wait
Before too long it just might fade away
Proceed with caution, caution, caution, caution[Verse 1: A$AP Rocky]
It's like our first date
Time past fast, like the flash of a blink
A little Chardonnay, lingerie and a mink
All I could think (Uh, uh, you're beautiful)
So don't complain when I'm in home late
A couple loose lips and the ship gon' sink
Don't even try to act like your shit don't stink
But still... ASAP!
Hold up wait, hit both brakes
Fuck third base 'cus I hit home plate
I'mma party hard like the disco days
Fat black plaques and them french fold braid
Cause homie pack steel, like below waist
Shawty got grill, like Chipotle
Now my favorite meal be the shrimp lo mein
But still... (You're beautiful)

[Verse 2: Miguel]
Hop on the back of my bike
Let the good wind blow through your hair
With an ass like that and a smile so bright
Oh, youre killing me, you know it aint fair, yeah
Ride on through the middle of the night
Let the moonlight kiss your skin
When you dance like that, your jeans so tight
Oh, youre killing me, baby do it again

[Hook: Miguel]
Youre beautiful, and your mind is fucking beautiful
And I cant pretend that that doesnt mean a thing to me, to me, yeah
Youre beautiful, good lord, youre fucking beautiful
And I cant pretend that that doesnt mean a thing to me, to me, yeah, yeah

[Verse 3: Mariah Carey]
I like when you run red lights
Dont stop til you thrill me, oh how you thrill me
Always in control, how you do it, I dont know
But I dont care, take me anywhere
Cause its beautiful, ooh you make me feel invincible
And I cant pretend that that doesnt mean a thing to me, to me, oh yeah

[Hook: Miguel & Mariah Carey]

[Outro]
Oh oh oh oh
Yeah yeah
You dont know what youre doing darling
Hop on back my bike darling
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Dont you worry darling[Intro: Layzie Bone]
Don't breakdown yet, it's over, over
Don't breakdown yet, it's over, over
Don't breakdown yet, it's over, over
Don't breakdown yet, it's over

[Krayzie Bone]
Steady breaking me on down
Break-breakdown
Steady breaking me on down
Break-breakdown
Steady breaking me on down

[Verse 1: Mariah Carey]
You called yesterday to basically say
That you care for me but
That you're just not in love
Immediately I pretended to be feeling similarly
And led you to believe I was O.K. to just walk away
From the one thing that's unyielding and sacred to me

[Chorus: Mariah Carey]
Well, I guess I'm trying to be nonchalant about it
And I'm going to extremes to prove I'm fine without you
But in reality I'm slowly losing my mind
Underneath the guise of smile
Gradually I'm dying inside
Friends ask me how I feel and I lie convincingly
'Cause I don't want to reveal the fact that I'm suffering
So I wear my disguise 'til I go home at night
And turn down all the lights
And then I breakdown and cry

[Mariah Carey]
So what do you do when
Somebody you're so devoted to
Suddenly just stops loving you
And it seems they haven't got a clue
Of the pain that rejection is putting you through
Do you cling to your pride
And sing "I Will Survive"
(Krayzie Bone in background: Gotta get control and roll roll roll on)
Do you lash out and say
How dare you leave this way
Do you hold in vain
As they just slip away

[Chorus: Mariah Carey]
Well, I guess I'm trying to be nonchalant about it
And I'm going to extremes to prove I'm fine without you
But in reality I'm slowly losing my mind (losing my mind)
Underneath the guise of smile
Gradually I'm dying inside
Friends ask me how I feel (How do I feel?)
And I lie convincingly
'Cause I don't want to reveal the fact that I'm suffering
So I wear my disguise 'til I go home at night
And turn down all the lights
And then I breakdown and cry

[Wish Bone]
Gonna break you down, down, down, only if you let it (Don't let it)
Everyday crazy situations rocking my mind trying to break me down
But I won't let it, forget it
If you feel the same way that I do
Then let me hear y'all all sing too
Sing, it's al-right, it's alright, it's alright, yeah
Hoping for the sun, but it looks like rain
B-O-N-E, but it's still the same
Came this far, but it's been a long road
Troubles gonna come but we gotta stay strong, hold on, on

[Krayzie Bone]
Aw, yeah, I often feel the pressures, y'all
But nevertheless Krayzie won't fall
It's over, it's ending here, here
I said it's over, it's ending here, here
So I'll be on my way
And maybe we can meet up in the future one day
But for now I'm bailing, bailing
Bailing!, baby gotta get up, can't take no more
I'm headed for the door
Come and take a look into this humble eye
Tell me, if we lived a lie would our souls unite?

[Layzie Bone]
Every new day is a test for me
So I just pray to the Lord for him to bless me, please
There's struggles I'm going through lately
Breaks me down, set me free
Let me be, let me be
Who else do we have to rely on
Whose shoulder can a thug go cry on
Came to get my vibe on
While you look into my eyes
Won't underestimate this soldier story
I'mma tell you right now I'mma stand up
Wrong if I let my lead bust
Pac said keep your head up
Don't let this world get the best of you
All my struggles, I'm through
If it's over, over, over
Don't breakdown yet it's over

Cry, cry (Break break down)
Cry, cry (Steady breaking me on down)
Cry, cry (Break break down)
Cry, cry (Steady breaking me on down)[Intro]
This is for my peoples who just lost somebody
Your best friend, your baby, your man, or your lady
Put your hand way up high
We will never say bye (No, no, no)
Mamas, daddies, sisters, brothers, friends and cousins
This is for my peoples who lost their grandmothers
Lift your head to the sky, 'cause we will never say bye

[Verse 1]
As a child, there were them times
I didn't get it, but you kept me in line
I didn't know why you didn't show up sometimes
On Sunday mornings, and I missed you
But I'm glad we talked through
All them grown folk things separation brings
You never let me know it
You never let it show because you loved me and obviously
There's so much more left to say
If you were with me today face to face

[Chorus]
I never knew I could hurt like this
And every day life goes on like
"I wish I could talk to you for awhile
Miss you, but I try not to cry, as time goes by"
And it's true that you've reached a better place
Still, I'd give the world to see your face
And I'm right here next to you
But it's like you're gone too soon
Now the hardest thing to do is say bye bye
Bye bye, bye bye, bye bye
Bye bye, bye bye, bye bye
Bye bye, bye bye, bye bye
Bye bye, bye bye

[Verse 2]
And you never got a chance to see how good I've done
And you never got to see me back at number one
I wish that you were here to celebrate together
I wish that we could spend the holidays together
I remember when you used to tuck me in at night
With the teddy bear you gave to me that I held so tight
I thought you were so strong, you'd make it through whatever
It's so hard to accept the fact you're gone forever

[Chorus]
I never knew I could hurt like this
And everyday life goes on like
"I wish I could talk to you for awhile
Miss you, but I try not to cry, as time goes by"
And it's true that you've reached a better place
Still, I'd give the world to see your face
And I'm right here next to you
But it's like you're gone too soon
Now the hardest thing to do is say bye bye
Bye bye, bye bye, bye bye (The hardest thing to say, bye bye)
Bye bye, bye bye, bye bye
Bye bye, bye bye, bye bye
Bye bye (Bye bye)

[Bridge]
This is for my peoples who just lost somebody
Your best friend, your baby, your man, or your lady
Put your hand way up high
We will never say bye (No, no, no)
Mamas, daddies, sisters, brothers, friends and cousins
This is for my peoples who lost their grandmothers
Lift your head to the sky, 'cause we will never say bye
Bye

[Chorus]
I never knew I could hurt like this (I never knew it)
And every day life goes on like
"I wish I could talk to you for awhile
Miss you, but I try not to cry (I wish)
(I wish) As time goes by"
And it's true that you've reached a better place
Still, I'd give the world to see your face
And I'm right here next to you
But it's like you're gone too soon
Now the hardest thing to do is say bye bye
(Bye bye, bye bye, bye bye...)

[Outro]
It's hard to say bye bye, bye bye, bye bye
So come on, somebody sing it with me
Wave your hands up high (Bye bye, bye bye, bye bye)
This is for my peoples who just lost somebody
(Bye bye, bye bye, bye bye)
So this is for everybody
(Bye bye, bye bye, bye bye)
So just keep your hands to the sky
(Bye bye, bye bye, bye bye)
'Cause we will never say bye bye[Verse 1: Mariah Carey]
I shouldn't have walked away
I would've stayed if you said
We could've made everything OK
But we just threw the blame back and forth
We treated love like a sport
The final blow hit so low
I'm still on the ground

[Pre-Chorus: Mariah Carey]
I couldn't have prepared myself for this fall
Shattered in pieces, curled on the floor
Supernatural love conquers all
'Member we used to touch the sky

[Chorus: Mariah Carey]
And lightning don't strike the same place twice
When you and I said goodbye, I felt the angels cry
True love's a gift, we let it drift in a storm
Every night, I feel the angels cry
C'mon babe, can't our love be revived?
Bring it back and we gon' make it right
I'm on the edge just trying to survive
As the angels cry

[Verse 2: Ne-Yo]
I thought we'd be forever and always
You were serenity, you took away the bad days
Didn't always treat you right, but it was OK
I do somethin' stupid and you still stay with me
But you can only go for so long
Doing the one you claim to love wrong
Before too much is enough
You look up, find your love gone and

[Pre-Chorus: Ne-Yo]
We were so good together
How come we could not weather
This storm and just do better
Why did we say goodbye?

[Chorus: Ne-Yo & (Mariah Carey)]
'Cause lightning don't strike the same place twice
When you and I said goodbye, I felt the angels cry
True love's a gift, we let it drift in a storm
Every night, I feel the angels cry
(C'mon babe, can't our love be revived?)
(Bring it back and we gon' make it right)
(I'm on the edge just trying' to survive)
(As the angels cry)

[Bridge: Mariah Carey]
Baby, I'm missing you
Don't allow our love to lose
We gotta ride it through
I'm reaching for you
And I'm gonna say
Baby, I'm missing' you
Don't allow our love to lose
We gotta ride it through
I'm reaching for you
And I'm gonna say

[Chorus: Mariah Carey & Ne-Yo]
Lightning don't strike the same place twice
When you and I said goodbye, I felt the angels cry
'Cause true love's a gift, we let it drift in a storm
Every night, I feel the angels cry

[Outro: Mariah Carey]
Oh, babe, don't let angels cry[Verse 1]
Treated me kind
Sweet destiny
Carried me through desperation
To the one that was waiting for me
It took so long
Still I believed
Somehow the one that I needed
Would find me eventually

[Chorus]
I had a vision of love
And it was all that you've given to me

[Verse 2]
Prayed through the nights
Felt so alone
Suffered from alienation
Carried the weight on my own
Had to be strong
So I believed
And now I know I've succeeded
In finding the place I conceived

[Chorus]
I had a vision of love
And it was all that you've given to me
I had a vision of love
And it was all that you've given me

[Bridge]
I've realized the dream
And I visualized
The love that came to be
Feel so alive
I'm so thankful that I've received
The answer that heaven has sent down to me

[Verse 3]
You treated me kind
Sweet destiny
And I'll be eternally grateful
Holding you so close to me
Prayed through the nights
So faithfully
Knowing the one that I needed
Would find me eventually

[Chorus]
I had a vision of love
And it was all that you've given to me
I had a vision of love
And it was all that you turned out to be[Intro: Mariah Carey]
Hey, baby, what's happenin'? How you doin'?
We can make it, baby, me and you
(Me and you, me and you, me and you, me and you)
It wasn't really, wasn't really
It wasn't really much at all
It wasn't really

[Verse 1: Mariah Carey]
So, it's summertime, lil splash a wine
And forget about it
If you're so inclined, let's take a ride tonight
So, then maybe if the stars align
We'll fix our minds on another tangent
And it's kinda like impossible to top this at all

[Chorus: Mariah Carey]
Giving me life and it's everything
Thinkin' 'bout when we were seventeen
Feelin' myself like I'm Norma Jeane
Here in my arms is where you should be

[Post-Chorus: Mariah Carey]
It wasn't really, it wasn't really much
It wasn't really much at all
It wasn't really, it wasn't really
Wasn't really much at all

[Verse 2: Mariah Carey]
Oh, my philosophy
Doesn't quite apply to you and me
But I won't think too much
So, come on and feel my touch
It wasn't really much at all
Just a little sensitivity, yeah that's all
Here in my heart is where you should be
Ooh, you are

[Chorus: Mariah Carey]
Giving me life and it's everything
Thinkin' 'bout when we were seventeen
Livin' like Babs 'cause it's evergreen
Here in my arms is where you should be

[Post-Chorus: Mariah Carey & Slick Rick]
It wasn't really, it wasn't really much
It wasn't really much at all (It really wasn't)
It wasn't really, it wasn't really (The Ruler)
Wasn't really much at all

[Verse 3: Slick Rick]
Wassup, ma? Hush, got fly
Here's a quest, why you left? Was it my messed up eye? Why?
Reminisce, wannabe, huh?
See, hon, followed sheep from once the first chick
Clark Wallabees on (Beep, beep)
Swag, honey drip, spendin' some time
Remember them rhymes?
Your gold fronts looked better than mines did
Was ecstasy, poundin' in the BM
Clownin' me and that was way before wore gowns and the skin'
Givin' me life

[Chorus: Mariah Carey & Slick Rick]
Giving me life and it's everything (Mariah Carey)
Thinkin' 'bout when we were seventeen
Feelin' myself like I'm Norma Jeane (La, la, la-la)
Here in my arms is where you should be (Where you should be)
Ooh, you are giving me life (Giving me life)
And it's everything (Everything)
Thinkin' 'bout when we were seventeen
(Thinkin' 'bout when we were)
Livin' like Babs 'cause it's evergreen ('Cause it's evergreen)
Here in my arms is where you should be
Ooh, you are giving me life and it's everything
(Wasn't really, wasn't really)
Thinkin' 'bout when we were seventeen
(Got me thinkin' bout' when we were, yeah, yeah)
(Wasn't really much at all)
Feeling myself like I'm Norma Jeane
(Said, I'm feeling myself like I'm)
(Wasn't really, wasn't really)
Here in my arms is where you should be (Right here in my arms)
(Wasn't really much at all)
Giving me life and it's everything

[Outro: Mariah Carey]
It was a stone groove, my man
You are the most righteous
Yeah, right, just get the fuck out
(Get the fuck out, get the fuck out
Get the fuck out, get the fuck out)
Oh, oh, oh-oh, oh
Giving me life and it's all (Giving me life)
Giving me life, da-da-da, yeah (Yeah, givin', givin' me life)
Giving me life and it's all (Wasn't really much at all, much at all)
(Giving me life)
Giving me life and it's all (Wasn't really, wasn't really)
Giving me life and it's all
Giving me life and it's all
Giving me life and it's all
Giving me life and it's all
Giving me life and it's all
Whoa, whoa-whoa
Giving me life and it's all
Oh, giving me life and it's all[Intro]
Weeping may endure for a night
But joy comes in the morning
Trust Him

[Verse 1]
Somehow I know that
There's a place up above
With no more hurt and struggling
Free of all atrocities and suffering
Because I feel the unconditional love
From one who cares enough for me
To erase all my burdens and let me be free to

[Chorus]
Fly like a bird, take to the sky
I need you now Lord, carry me high
Don't let the world break me tonight
I need the strength of you by my side
Sometimes this life can be so cold
I pray you'll come and carry me home

[Verse 2]
Can we recover?
Will the world ever be
A place of peace and harmony
With no war and with no brutality?
If we loved each other
We would find victory
But in this harsh reality
Sometimes I'm so despondent that I feel the need to

[Chorus]
Fly like a bird, take to the sky
I need you now Lord, carry me high
Don't let the world break me tonight
I need the strength of you by my side
Sometimes this life can be so cold
I pray you'll come and carry me home

[Bridge]
I need you right now, right now, Lord
I need you right here by my side
Keep your head to the sky
With God's love, you'll survive

[Chorus]
Fly like a bird, take to the sky
I need you now Lord, carry me high
Don't let the world break me tonight
I need the strength of you by my side
Sometimes this life can be so cold
I pray you'll come (I'll pray) and carry me home
You'll come and take me home
Fly like a bird, take to the sky
I need you now Lord, carry me high
Don't let the world break me tonight
I need the strength of you by my side
Sometimes this life can be so cold
I pray you'll come and carry me home
Carry me home, oh, carry me home
Carry me higher, higher, higher
Carry me higher, higher, higher
I need you to come and carry me higher, Lord
Carry me higher, higher, higher
Carry me higher, higher, higher
Carry me home, higher, Jesus
Just carry me higher Lord[Verse 1: Gucci Mane]
I guess shorty mad he don't got you no more
So just like Pinocchio, his nose gon' grow
Gucci Mane, Mariah Carey bling blaw wow
I wish I had a lie detector test right now
He hit my girl, word? Oh that's what you heard?
He know he a bird, I know he a nerd
Catch me in the A with a bad yellow bone
9, 10, 11, 12 diamond chains on

[Mariah Carey]
All up in the blogs
Saying we met at the bar
When I don't even know who you are
Say we up in your house
Saying I'm up in your car
But you in LA and I'm out at Jermaine's
I'm up in the A, you're so, so lame
And no one here even mentions your name
It must be the weed, it must be the E
Cause you be poppin', hood, you get it poppin

Oooh whooa
Why you so obsessed with me?
Boy I want to know
Lyin' that you're sexin' me
When everybody knows
It's clear that you're upset with me

Finally found a girl that you couldn't impress
Last man on the earth still couldn't get this

You're delusional, you're delusional
Boy you're losing your mind
It's confusing, yo, you're confused, you know
Why you wasting your time?
Got you all fired up with your Napoleon complex

[Mariah Carey]
You on your job, you hittin' hard

Graspin' for air, I'm ventilation
You out of breath, hope you ain't waitin'
Tellin' the world how much you miss me

Let's show the world you're my golden girl

They say 'Son, scooped a hot one'
You taste like banana cake
You shaped like the number eight
And you my number one candidate
I can't lose you, it's like I'm bettin' in Vegas, crucial
Sweatin', knowin' these players is wantin' you, Boo
I get the chills when you in my sight
Feels like it's meant to be right
Thank God I found you
I feel a rush when I kiss you at night, uh

[Verse 2: Joe]
Shorty knows she my baby girl and
Player haters try hard to get her
But she'll be lounging in my cradle tonight, oh
Typically a thug wouldn't say this
But you see your love has got me faded
No girl ever made me feel like you do, oh

[Verse 3: Mariah]
Hmm, I'mma be here night after night to

Your love is so marvelous
Joy, that's what I feel

What? A thug's dream wife, jeans tight, beautiful skin
Matching brown Timbs, hot as jalapenos
She knows how to hide the ninos
The rap Rudolph Valentino
In beef I become the black Al Pacino
Relax, sweetie, in Benz you could watch the TV
Or lay back and pump Mariah's hot CD
And I'mma touch you in the wrong places
Or we could walk through the park
In our bubble north faces, I'm lost in your love
Thank God I found you, you my crown jewel
I'm sayin' boo the type I give my last name to
Make it last
At Lover's Lane put the top up
When it start to rain in the parkin' lot
Then we finish doing our thing
Fog the windows gettin' very sentimental
Sippin' Cosmos with the cherry in the middle
I keep it honest, word to Will that's my promise
Signin' off, truly yours, Nastradamus
Thank God I found you

[Chorus: Mariah, Joe & Nas]
Thank God I found you, thank you, Lord

Whoa, oh, oh, oh, oh, don't you let it end
Make it last, oh baby
We make it last, make it last
We make it last, make it last
See I was so lost without your love
I was lost without you
We make it last, make it last
We make it last, make it last
My every wish and dreams became reality
Thank God I found you

She was more like a beauty queen from a movie scene
I said, "Don't mind, but what do you mean, I am the one
Who will dance on the floor in the round?"
She said I am the one
Who will dance on the floor, in the round
She told me her name was Billie Jean
As she caused a scene
Then every head turned with eyes that dreamed of being the one
Who will dance on the floor in the round

[Pre-Chorus]
People always told me, "Be careful of what you do
Don't go around breaking young girls' hearts" (Hee-eeh)
And mother always told me, "Be careful of who you love
And be careful of what you do (Oh-oh)
'Cause the lie becomes the truth" (Oh-oh)

[Chorus]
Billie Jean is not my lover
She's just a girl who claims that I am the one (Oh, baby)
But the kid is not my son, hoo!
She says I am the one (Oh, baby)
But the kid is not my son (Hee-hee-hee, no-no-no, hee-hee-hee)
Hoo!

[Verse 2]
For forty days and for forty nights, I was always on her side
But who can stand when she's in demand?
Her schemes and plans
'Cause we danced on the floor in the round, hee!
So take my strong advice, just remember to always think twice
(Don't think twice) Do think twice! (Ah-hoo!)
She told my baby we'd danced till three, then she looked at me
Then showed a photo of a baby crying, his eyes were like mine (Oh, no)
'Cause we danced on the floor in the round, baby
(Ooh, hee-hee-hee)
Hee
Hoo
[Pre-Chorus]
People always told me, "Be careful of what you do
And don't go around breaking young girls' hearts"
(Don't break no hearts!) (Hee-hee)
But she came and stood right by me
Then the smell of sweet perfume (Ha-oh)
This happened much too soon (Ha-oh, ha-ooh)
She called me to her room (Ha-oh, hoo!)

[Chorus]
Billie Jean is not my lover (Hoo!)
She's just a girl who claims that I am the one
But the kid is not my son
No-no-no, no-no-no-no-no-no
Billie Jean is not my lover
She's just a girl who claims that I am the one (Oh baby)
But the kid is not my son (Oh, no, no)
She says I am the one (Oh baby)
But the kid is not my son (No, hee-hee)

[Break]
Ah, hee-hee-hee
Hee! Hoo!

[Chorus]
She says I am the one, but the kid is not my son
No-no-no, hoo! (Oh)
Billie Jean is not my lover
She's just a girl who claims that I am the one
But the kid is not my son
No-no-no, no-no-no-no
She says I am the one, but the kid is not my son (No-no-no)
She says I am the one (You know what you did)
She says he is my son (Breaking my heart babe)
She says I am the one

[Outro]
Billie Jean is not my lover
Billie Jean is not my lover
Billie Jean is not my lover
Billie Jean is not my lover (Don't call me Billie Jean)
Billie Jean is not my lover...[Verse 1]
As he came into the window
Was a sound of a crescendo
He came into her apartment
He left the bloodstains on the carpet
She ran underneath the table
He could see she was unable
So she ran into the bedroom
She was struck down, it was her doom

[Pre-Chorus]
Annie, are you okay?
So, Annie, are you okay? Are you okay, Annie?
Annie, are you okay?
So, Annie, are you okay? Are you okay, Annie?
Annie, are you okay?
So, Annie, are you okay? Are you okay, Annie?
Annie, are you okay?
So, Annie, are you okay? Are you okay, Annie?

[Chorus]
Annie, are you okay?
Will you tell us that you're okay?
There's a sound at the window
Then he struck you  a crescendo, Annie
He came into your apartment
Left the bloodstains on the carpet
And then you ran into the bedroom
You were struck down
It was your doom

[Post-Chorus]
Annie, are you okay?
So, Annie, are you okay? Are you okay, Annie?
Annie, are you okay?
So, Annie, are you okay? Are you okay, Annie?
Annie, are you okay?
So, Annie, are you okay? Are you okay, Annie?

[Refrain]
You've been hit by
You've been hit by
A Smooth Criminal

[Verse 2]
So they came in to the outway
It was Sunday, what a black day
Every time I tried to find him
There were no clues, theyre behind him
And they end up never knowing
Whos the suspect or what to expect
Mouth-to-mouth resuscitation
Sounding heartbeats, intimidation

[Pre-Chorus]
Annie, are you okay?
So, Annie, are you okay? Are you okay, Annie?
Annie, are you okay?
So, Annie, are you okay? Are you okay, Annie?
Annie, are you okay?
Annie, are you okay? Are you okay?
Annie, are you okay?
So, Annie, are you okay? Are you okay, Annie?
Annie, are you okay?
So, Annie, are you okay? Are you okay, Annie?

[Chorus]
Annie, are you okay?
Will you tell us that you're okay?
There's a sound at the window
Then he struck you  a crescendo, Annie
He came into your apartment
Left the bloodstains on the carpet
And then you ran into the bedroom
You were struck down
It was your doom

[Post-Chorus]
Annie, are you okay? Annie, are you okay?
Are you okay, Annie?

[Refrain]
You've been hit by
You've been struck by
A Smooth Criminal

[Interlude]
Okay, I want everybody to clear the area right now!

[Outro]
Annie, are you okay? (I don't know)
Will you tell us that you're okay? (I don't know)
There's a sound at the window (I don't know)
Then he struck you, a crescendo Annie? (I don't know)
He came into your apartment (I don't know)
Left bloodstains on the carpet (I don't know why, baby)
And then you ran into the bedroom (Help me)
You were struck down
It was your doom Annie (Dag gone it)
Annie are you okay? (Dag gone it-baby)
Will you tell us that you're okay? (Dag gone it-baby)
There's a sound at the window (Dag gone it-baby)
Then he struck you, a crescendo Annie
He came into your apartment, (Dag gone it)
Left bloodstains on the carpet
And then you ran into the bedroom
You were struck down (Dag gone it)
It was your doom Annie[Intro]
All I want to say is that they don't really care about us
Don't worry what people say, we know the truth
All I want to say is that they don't really care about us
Enough is enough of this garbage
All I want to say is that they don't really care about us
(Overlapping voices)

[Verse 1]
Skin head, dead head, everybody gone bad
Situation, aggravation, everybody, allegation
In the suit, on the news, everybody, dog food
Bang bang, shot dead, everybody's gone mad

[Chorus]
All I wanna say is that they don't really care about us
All I wanna say is that they don't really care about us

[Verse 2]
Beat me, hate me, you can never break me
Will me, thrill me, you can never kill me
Jew me, sue me, everybody do me
Kick me, kike me, don't you black or white me

[Chorus]
All I wanna say is that they don't really care about us
All I wanna say is that they don't really care about us

[Post-Chorus]
Tell me, what has become of my life?
I have a wife and two children who love me
I am the victim of police brutality, now
I'm tired of being the victim of hate
You're ripping me of my pride, oh, for God's sake
I look to heaven to fulfill its prophecy, set me free

[Verse 3]
Skin head, dead head, everybody's gone bad
Trepidation, speculation, everybody, allegation
In the suit, on the news, everybody, dog food
Black male, blackmail, throw the brother in jail

[Chorus]
All I wanna say is that they don't really care about us
All I wanna say is that they don't really care about us

[Post-Chorus]
Tell me, what has become of my rights?
Am I invisible 'cause you ignore me?
Your proclamation promised me free liberty, now
I'm tired of being the victim of shame
They're throwing me in a class with a bad name
I can't believe this is the land from which I came
You know, I really do hate to say it
The government don't wanna see
But if Roosevelt was livin'
He wouldn't let this be, no, no

[Verse 4]
Skin head, dead head, everybody's gone bad
Situation, speculation, everybody, litigation
Beat me, bash me, you can never trash me
Hit me, kick me, you can never get me

[Chorus]
All I wanna say is that they don't really care about us
All I wanna say is that they don't really care about us

[Bridge]
Some things in life
They just don't wanna see
But if Martin Luther was livin'
He wouldn't let this be, no, no

[Verse 5]
Skin head, dead head, everybody's gone bad
Situation, segregation, everybody, allegation
In the suit, on the news, everybody, dog food
Kick me, kike me, don't you wrong or right me

[Chorus]
All I wanna say is that they don't really care about us
All I wanna say is that they don't really care about us
All I wanna say is that they don't really care about us
All I wanna say is that they don't really care about us
All I wanna say is that they don't really care about us
All I wanna say is that they don't really care about us[Verse 1]
I'm gonna make a change
For once in my life
Gonna feel real good
Gonna make a difference
Gonna make it right
As I turn up the collar on my favorite winter coat
This wind is blowin' my mind
See the kids in the street, with not enough to eat
Who am I to be blind, pretending not to see their needs
A summer's disregard, a broken bottle top
And one man's soul
They follow each other on the wind, ya know
'Cause they got nowhere to go
That's why I want you to know

[Chorus]
I'm starting with the man in the mirror
I'm asking him to change his ways
And no message could have been any clearer
If you wanna make the world a better place
Take a look at yourself and then make a change

Na-na-na na-na-na nana-nana

[Verse 2]
I've been a victim of a selfish kinda love
It's time that I realize
There are some with no home
Not a nickel to loan
Could it be really me pretending that they're not alone
A willow deeply scarred, somebody's broken heart
And a washed-out dream
They follow the pattern of the wind, ya see
'Cause they got no place to be
That's why I'm starting with me

[Extended Chorus]
I'm starting with the man in the mirror (Who?)
I'm asking him to change his ways (Who?)
And no message could have been any clearer
If you wanna make the world a better place
Take a look at yourself and then make a change

I'm starting with the man in the mirror (Who?)
I'm asking him to change his ways (Who?)
And no message could have been any clearer
If you wanna make the world a better place
Take a look at yourself and then make that change

I'm starting with the man in the mirror (Man in the mirror, oh yeah)
I'm asking him to change his ways (Change his ways)
(Come on, change)
And no message could have been any clearer

[Bridge]
If you wanna make the world a better place
Take a look at yourself and then make the change
You gotta get it right, while you got the time
'Cause when you close your heart (You can't)
Then you close your mind (Close your, your mind!)

[Chorus]
(That man, that man) I'm starting with the man in the mirror
(That man)
(Ooh!)
(That man, that man) I'm asking him to change his ways
(That man, the man)
(Change his ways, ooh!)
And no message could have been any clearer
If you want to make the world a better place
Take a look at yourself and then make that
(Take a look at yourself and then make that)
Change!

[Outro]
Woo, woo (Na-na-na na-na-na nana-nana) woo, woo, woo, woo, woo
Gonna feel real good (Oh yeah)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah (Na-na-na na-na-na nana-nana)
Yeah, yeah, oh, oh no

I'm gonna make a change
It's gonna feel real good, Shamone (Change)
Just lift yourself, you know
You've got to start with yourself, (Yeah) hoo!
(Make that change) I gotta make that change today, woo!
(Man in the mirror) You got to, you got to not pick yourself, brother, hoo! (Yeah)
You know (Make that change)
I've gotta get that man, that man (Man in the mirror)
You got to, you got to move, Shamone, Shamone
You got to stand up (Yeah) stand up (Make that change) stand up, stand up and lift yourself now (Man in the mirror)
Hoo, hoo, hoo! Ow! (Yeah, make that change)
Make that change, Shamone (Man in the mirror)
You know it, you know it, you know it, you know (Change)

Make that change![Chorus]

[Verse 1]
I took my baby to the doctor with a fever
But nothing he found
By the time this hit the street
They said she had a breakdown
Someone's always trying
To start my baby crying
Talking, squealing, lying
Saying you just want to be starting something

[Chorus]
I said you want to be starting something
You got to be starting something
I said you want to be starting something

And the pain is thunder (yeah, yeah)

[Verse 2]
You love to pretend that you're good
When you're always up to no good
You really can't make him hate her
So your tongue became a razor
Someone's always trying
To keep my baby crying
Treacherous, cunning, declining
You got my baby crying (Hee)

[Chorus]
I said you want to be starting something
You got to be starting something
I said you want to be starting something
You got to be starting something
It's too high to get over (yeah, yeah)
You're too low to get under (yeah, yeah)
You're stuck in the middle (yeah, yeah)
And the pain is thunder (yeah, yeah)
It's too high to get over (yeah, yeah)
You're too low to get under (yeah, yeah)
You're stuck in the middle (yeah, yeah)
And the pain is thunder (yeah, yeah)

Still they hate you (Still they hate you)
You're a vegetable (You're a vegetable)
You're just a buffet (You're just a buffet)
You're a vegetable (You're a vegetable)
They eat off of you (They eat off of you)
You're a vegetable

[Verse 3]
Billie Jean is always talking when nobody else is talking
Telling lies and rubbing shoulders
So they called her mouth a motor
Someone's always trying
To start my baby crying
Talking, squealing, spying
Saying you just want to be starting something

[Chorus]
I said you want to be starting something
You got to be starting something
I said you want to be starting something
You got to be starting something
It's too high to get over (yeah, yeah)

They eat off of you (They eat off of you)
You're a vegetable

[Verse 4]
If you can't feed your baby (yeah, yeah)
Then don't have a baby (yeah, yeah)
And don't think maybe (yeah, yeah)
If you can't feed your baby (yeah, yeah)
You'll be always trying
To stop that child from cryin'
Hustling, stealing, lying
Now baby's slowly dyin'

[Chorus]

Lift your head up high and scream out to the world
"I know I am someone," and let the truth unfurl
No one can hurt you now because you know what's true
Yes, I believe in me, so do believe in you

It's close to midnight
Something evil's lurking in the dark
Under the moonlight
You see a sight that almost stops your heart
You try to scream
But terror takes the sound before you make it
You start to freeze
As horror looks you right between your eyes
You're paralyzed

[Chorus 1: Michael Jackson]
'Cause this is thriller
Thriller night
And no one's gonna save you
From the beast about to strike
You know it's thriller
Thriller night
You're fighting for your life
Inside a killer
Thriller tonight, yeah, ooh

[Verse 2: Michael Jackson]
You hear the door slam
And realize there's nowhere left to run
You feel the cold hand
And wonder if you'll ever see the sun
You close your eyes
And hope that this is just imagination
Girl, but all the while
You hear a creature creeping up behind
You're out of time

[Chorus 2: Michael Jackson]
'Cause this is thriller, thriller night
There ain't no second chance
Against the thing with 40 eyes, girl
(Ooh, ooh)
Thriller, thriller night
You're fighting for your life
Inside a killer, thriller tonight

[Bridge: Michael Jackson]
Night creatures call
And the dead start to walk in their masquerade
There's no escaping the jaws of the alien this time
They're open wide
This is the end of your life, ooh

[Verse 3: Michael Jackson]
They're out to get you
There's demons closing in on every side, ooh
They will possess you
Unless you change that number on your dial
Now is the time
For you and I to cuddle close together, yeah
All through the night
I'll save you from the terror on the screen
I'll make you see

[Chorus 3: Michael Jackson]
That this is thriller, thriller night
'Cause I can thrill you more
Than any ghoul would ever dare try
Thriller, thriller night
So let me hold you tight
And share a killer, thriller, chiller
Thriller here tonight
'Cause this is thriller, thriller night
Girl, I can thrill you more
Than any ghoul would ever dare try
(Ooh, ooh)
Thriller, thriller night
So let me hold you tight
And share a killer, thriller
I'm gonna thrill you tonight

[Outro: Vincent Price & Michael Jackson]
Darkness falls across the land
The midnight hour is close at hand
Creatures crawl in search of blood
To terrorize y'all's neighborhood
I'm gonna thrill you tonight
And whosoever shall be found
Without the soul for getting down
Must stand and face the hounds of hell
And rot inside a corpse's shell
I'm gonna thrill you tonight
(Thriller, ooh, thriller)
I'm gonna thrill you tonight
(Thriller night, thriller)
I'm gonna thrill you tonight
Ooh, babe, I'm gonna thrill you tonight
Thriller night, babe
The foulest stench is in the air
The funk of 40 thousand years (Thriller night, thriller)
And grisly ghouls from every tomb
Are closing in to seal your doom
And though you fight to stay alive
Your body starts to shiver (I'm gonna thrill you tonight)
For no mere mortal can resist
The evil of the thriller!
AHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
AHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA![Verse 1]
They told him, "Don't you ever come around here
Don't wanna see your face, you better disappear"
The fire's in their eyes and their words are really clear
So beat it, just beat it (Woo!)
You better run, you better do what you can
Don't wanna see no blood, don't be a macho man (Woo!)
You wanna be tough, better do what you can
So beat it, but you wanna be bad

[Chorus]
Just beat it, beat it, beat it, beat it
No one wants to be defeated
Showin' how funky and strong is your fight
It doesn't matter who's wrong or right
Just beat it (Beat it)
Just beat it (Beat it)
Just beat it (Beat it)
Just beat it (Beat it, uh)

[Verse 2]
They're out to get you, better leave while you can
Don't wanna be a boy, you wanna be a man
You wanna stay alive, better do what you can
So beat it, just beat it (Woo!)
You have to show them that you're really not scared (Woo!)
You're playin' with your life, this ain't no truth or dare
(Woo!)
They'll kick you, then they'll beat you, then they'll tell you it's fair
So beat it, but you wanna be bad

No one wants to be...[Verse 1]
Looking out, across the nighttime
The city winks a sleepless eye
Hear her voice, shake my window
Sweet seducing sighs
Get me out, into the nighttime
Four walls won't hold me tonight
If this town is just an apple
Then let me take a bite

[Chorus]
If they say why (why?), why (why?)
Tell them that it's human nature
Why (why?), why (why?), does he do me that way?
If they say why (why?), why (why?)
Tell them that it's human nature
Why (why?), why (why?), does he do me that way?

[Verse 2]
Reaching out to touch a stranger
Electric eyes are everywhere
See that girl, she knows I'm watching
She likes the way I stare

[Chorus]
If they say why (why?), why (why?)
Tell them that it's human nature
Why (why?), why (why?), does he do me that way?
If they say why (why?), why (why?)
(She's keeping him by, keeping him around)
Tell them that it's human nature
Why (why?), why (why?), does he do me that way?

[Bridge]
I like livin' this way
I like lovin' this way
(That way) Why? Oh, why?
(That way) Why? Oh, why?

[Verse 3]
Looking out, across the morning
The city's heart begins to beat
Reaching out, I touch her shoulder
I'm dreaming of the street

[Chorus]
If they say why (why?), why (why?)
Tell them that it's human nature
Why (why?), why (why?), does he do me that way?
If they say why (why?), why (why?)
(She's keeping him by, keeping him around)
Ooh-ooh, tell 'em!
Why (why?), why (why?), does he do me that way?
If they say why (why?), why (why?), why (why?)
Cha-da-cha-sha-sha-sha-sha-sha (aah-ah)
Why (why?), why (why?), does he do me that way?
If they say why (why? why?), why (why? why? why?)
(She's keeping him by, keeping him around)
Ooh-ooh, tell 'em! (aah-ah)
Why (why?), why (why?), does he do me that way?
If they say why (why?), why (why?), why (why?)
Ooh, tell 'em!
Why (why?), why (why?), does he do me that way?
If they say why (why?), why (why?)
(She's keeping him by, keeping him around)
Da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da
Why (why?), why (why?), does he do me that way?
I like living this way
Why? Oh, why? (that way)
Why? Oh, why? (that way)
Why? Oh, why? (that way)[Verse 1]
You'll never make me stay
So take your weight off of me
I know your every move
So won't you just let me be?
I've been here times before
But I was too blind to see
That you seduce every man
This time you won't seduce me
She's saying: "That's okay
Hey baby, do what you please
I have the stuff that you want
I am the thing that you need."
She looked me deep in the eyes
She's touching me so to start
She says: "There's no turning back."
She trapped me in her heart

[Chorus]
Dirty Diana, nah
Dirty Diana, nah
Dirty Diana, no
Dirty Diana, let me be!
Oh no, oh no, oh no

[Verse 2]
She likes the boys in the band
She knows when they come to town
Every musician's fan
After the curtain comes down
She waits at backstage doors
For those who have prestige
Who promise fortune and fame
A life that's so carefree
She's saying: "That's okay
Hey baby, do what you want
I'll be your night-loving thing
I'll be the freak you can taunt
And I don't care what you say
I want to go too far
I'll be your everything
If you make me a star."

Dirty Diana, nah
Dirty Diana, nah
Dirty Diana, no
Dirty Diana

Diana, Diana
Dirty Diana
It's Diana

[Verse 3]
She said: "I have to go home
'Cause I'm real tired you see
But I hate sleeping alone
Why don't you come with me?"
I said: "My baby's at home
She's probably worried tonight
I didn't call on the phone
To say that I'm alright."
Diana walked up to me
She said: "I'm all yours tonight."
At that I ran to the phone
Saying, "Baby, I'm alright."
I said: "But unlock the door
'Cause I forgot the key."
She said: "He's not coming back
Because he's sleeping with me."

[Chorus]
Dirty Diana, nah
Dirty Diana, nah
Dirty Diana, no
Dirty Diana
Dirty Diana, nah

Dirty Diana, no

Your butt is mine, gonna tell you right
Just show your face in broad daylight
I'm telling you on how I feel
Gonna hurt your mind, don't shoot to kill
Shamone, Shamone
Lay it on me, all right
I'm giving you on count of three
To show your stuff or let it be
I'm telling you just watch your mouth
I know your game what you're about

[Pre-Chorus]
Well they say the sky's the limit
And to me that's really true
But my friend you have seen nothing
Just wait til I get through

Because I'm bad, I'm bad (Shamone, really, really bad)
You know I'm bad, I'm bad

And the whole world has to answer right now
Just to tell you once again: Who's bad?

[Verse 2]
The word is out, you're doing wrong
Gonna lock you up before too long
Your lying eyes gonna tell you right
So listen up, don't make a fight
Your talk is cheap, you're not a man
You're throwing stones to hide your hands

[Pre-Chorus]
Well they say the sky's the limit
And to me that's really true
But my friend you have seen nothing
Just wait til I get through

[Chorus]
Because I'm bad, I'm bad (Shamone, really, really bad)
You know I'm bad, I'm bad
You know it (Really, really bad)
You know I'm bad, I'm bad (Shamone)
You know (Really, really bad)
And the whole world has to answer right now
Just to tell you once again: Who's bad?

[Pre-Chorus]
We can change the world tomorrow
This could be a better place
If you don't like what I'm saying
Then won't you slap my face?

Think about the generations and say that we want to make it a better place for our children, and our children's children, so that they know it's a better world for them
And think, if they can make it a better place...

[Verse 1]
There's a place in your heart
And I know that it is love
And this place could be much brighter than tomorrow
And if you really try
You'll find there's no need to cry
In this place, you will feel there's no hurt or sorrow

[Pre-Chorus 1]
There are ways to get there
If you care enough for the living
Make a little space
Make a better place

[Chorus]
Heal the world
Make it a better place
For you and for me and the entire human race
There are people dying
If you care enough for the living
Make a better place for you and for me

[Verse 2]
If you want to know why
There's a love that cannot lie
Love is strong, it only cares for joyful giving
If we try, we shall see
In this bliss, we cannot feel
Fear or dread, we stop existing and start living

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Then it feels that always
Love's enough for us growing
So make a better world
To make a better world

[Chorus]
Heal the world
Make it a better place
For you and for me and the entire human race
There are people dying
If you care enough for the living
Make a better place for you and for me

[Bridge]
And the dream we were conceived in will reveal a joyful face
And the world we once believed in will shine again in grace
Then why do we keep strangling life?
Would this Earth crucify its soul?
Though it's plain to see
This world is heavenly
Be God's glow

[Verse 3]
We could fly so high
Let our spirits never die
In my heart, I feel you are all my brothers
Create a world with no fear
Together, we'll cry happy tears
See the nations turn their swords into
Ploughshares

[Pre-Chorus 3]
We could really get there
If you cared enough for the living
Make a little space
To make a better place

[Chorus]
Heal the world
Make it a better place
For you and for me
And the entire human race
There are people dying
If you care enough for the living
Make a better place
For you and for me
Heal the world
Make it a better place
For you and for me and the entire human race
There are people dying
If you care enough for the living
Make a better place for you and for me
Heal the world (Heal the world)
Make it a better place
For you and for me and the entire human race
There are people dying
If you care enough for the living
Make a better place for you and for me

[Post-Chorus]
There are people dying
If you care enough for the living
Make a better place for you and for me
There are people dying
If you care enough for the living
Make a better place for you and for me

[Outro: Michael Jackson & Child]
Make a better place (You and for me)
Make a better place (You and for me)
Make a better place (You and for me)
(You and for me)
Heal the world we live in (You and for me)
Save it for our children (You and for me)
Heal the world we live in (You and for me)
Save it for our children (You and for me)
Heal the world we live in (You and for me)
Save it for our children (You and for me)
Heal the world we live in (You and for me)
Save it for our children[Skit]
Hey!

Dad, this is the best part, come on!
No, turn it off now!

[Verse 1]
I took my baby on a Saturday bang
Boy, is that girl with you?
Yes, we're one and the same
Now, I believe in miracles
And a miracle has happened tonight

[Chorus]
But, if you're thinking about my baby
It don't matter if you're black or white

[Verse 2]
They print my message in the Saturday sun
I had to tell them I ain't second to none
And I told 'em about equality
And it's true, either you're wrong or you're right

[Chorus]
But, if you're thinking about my baby
It don't matter if you're black or white

[Bridge]
I am tired of this devil
I am tired of this stuff
I am tired of this business
So when the going gets rough
I ain't scared of your brother
I ain't scared of no sheets
I ain't scared of nobody
Girl, when the going gets mean

[Rap: L.T.B.]
Protection for gangs, clubs and nations
Causing grief in human relations
It's a turf war on a global scale
I'd rather hear both sides of the tale
See, it's not about races
Just places, faces
Where your blood comes from is where your space is
I've seen the bright get duller
I'm not going to spend my life being a color

[Verse 3]
Don't tell me you agree with me
When I saw you kicking dirt in my eye

[Chorus]
But, if you're thinking about my baby
It don't matter if you're black or white
But, if you're thinking about my baby
It don't matter if you're black or white
I said if you're thinking of being my brother
It don't matter if you're black or white

[Outro]
It's black, it's white
It's tough for you to get by
It's black, it's white
It's tough for you to get by
It's black, it's white[Spoken Intro]

All the blood we've shed before?
Did you ever stop to notice

[Verse 1]
Another day has gone
I'm still all alone
How could this be
You're not here with me
You never said goodbye
Someone tell me why
Did you have to go
And leave my world so cold

[Pre-Chorus]
Every day I sit and ask myself
How did love slip away
Something whispers in my ear and says

[Chorus]
That you are not alone
I am here with you
Though you're far away
I am here to stay
But you are not alone
I am here with you
Though we're far apart
You're always in my heart
But you are not alone

'Lone, 'lone
Why, 'lone

[Verse 2]
Just the other night
I thought I heard you cry
Asking me to come
And hold you in my arms
I can hear your prayers
Your burdens I will bear
But first I need your hand
Then forever can begin

[Pre-Chorus]
Every day I sit and ask myself
How did love slip away
Something whispers in my ear and says

[Chorus]
That you are not alone
I am here with you
Though you're far away
I am here to stay
But you are not alone
I am here with you
Though we're far apart
You're always in my heart
But you are not alone

'Lone, 'lone
Why, 'lone

[Bridge]
Whisper three words and I'll come running
And girl you know that I'll be there
I'll be there

[Chorus to fade]
That you are not alone
I am here with you
Though you're far away
I am here to stay
But you are not alone
I am here with you
Though we're far apart
You're always in my heart
But you are not alone

'Lone, 'lone
Why, 'lone

[Outro sung over the Chorus]
For you are not alone
Not alone oh
You are not alone
You are not alone
Say it again
You are not alone
You are not alone
Not alone, Not alone
If you just reach out for me girl
In the morning, in the evening
Not alone, not alone
You and me not alone
Oh together together
Not not being alone
Not not being alone[Verse 1]
Do you remember when we fell in love?
We were young and innocent then
Do you remember how it all began?
It just seemed like heaven, so why did it end?

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Do you remember, back in the fall?
We'd be together all day long
Do you remember us holding hands?
In each other's eyes, we'd stare
Tell me

[Chorus]
Do you remember the time?
When we fell in love
Do you remember the time?
When we first met, girl
Do you remember the time?
(Oh, I)
When we fell in love
Do you remember the time?

[Verse 2]
Do you remember how we used to talk?
You know, we'd stay on the phone at night till dawn
Do you remember all the things we said?
Like, "I love you so, I'll never let you go"

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Do you remember, back in the spring?
Every morning, birds would sing
Do you remember those special times?
They'll just go on and on
In the back of my mind

[Chorus]
Do you remember the time?
When we fell in love
Do you remember the time?
When we first met, girl
Do you remember the time?
(Oh, I)
When we fell in love
Do you remember the time?

[Bridge]
Those sweet memories
Will always be dear to me
And girl no matter what was said
I will never forget what we had
Now baby

[Chorus]
Do you remember the time?
When we fell in love
Do you remember the time?
When we first met, girl
Do you remember the time?
(Oh, I)
When we fell in love
Do you remember the time?
(Remember, my baby)
Do you remember the time?
(Cause I remember)
When we fell in love
Do you remember the time?
(All in my mind, girl)
Do you remember the time?
(Oh, I)
When we fell in love
Do you remember the time?
(Remember, my baby)

[Breakdown]
(Remember the time)
Ooh!

On the phone, you and me
(Remember the time)
Till dawn, two or three
What about us, girl?
(Remember the time)
Do you, do you, do you?
(Remember the time)
Do you, do you?
In the park, on the beach
(Remember the time)
You and me, in Spain
What about, what about
(Remember the time)
Grrrrrat, tat tat, tat
Grrrrrat, tat tat
(Remember the time)
Ooh! In the park

After dark, do you, do you, do you?
(Remember the time)
Do you, do you, do you, did you?
(Remember the time)
Yeah, yeah, woo!
(Remember the time, remember the time)[Verse 1]
Hold me
Like the River Jordan
And I will then say to thee
You are my friend
Carry me
Like you are my brother
Love me like a mother
Will you be there?

[Verse 2]
Weary
Tell me will you hold me
When wrong, will you scold me
When lost will you find me?
But they told me
A man should be faithful
And walk when not able
And fight till the end
But I'm only human

[Verse 3]
Everyone's taking control of me
Seems that the world's
Got a role for me
I'm so confused
Will you show it to me
That you'll be there for me
And care enough to bear me

[Verse 4: Michael Jackson & Cleveland Orchestra]
Hold me
Show me
Lay your head lowly
Told me
Softly then boldly
Yeah
Carry me there
I'm only human
Lead me
Hold me
Love me and feed me
Yeah, yeah
Kiss me and free me
Yeah
I will feel blessed
I'm only human
Carry
Carry
Carry me boldly
Carry me
Lift me up slowly
Yeah
Carry me there
I'm only human!
Save me
Lift me
Heal me and bathe me
Lift me up, lift me up
Softly you say to me
I will be there
I will be there
Lift me
Lift me up slowly
Carry me boldly
Yeah
Show me you care
Hold me
Woo!
Lay your head lowly
It gets lonely sometimes
I get lonely, yeah, yeah
Softly then boldly
Carry me there
Need me
Woo!
Love me and feed me
Lift me up, hold me up
Lift me up sometimes, up sometimes
Kiss me and free me
I will feel blessed

[Spoken]
In our darkest hour, in my deepest despair
Will you still care?
Will you be there?
In my trials and my tribulations
Through our doubts and frustrations
In my violence, in my turbulence
Through my fear and my confessions
In my anguish and my pain
Through my joy and my sorrow
In the promise of another tomorrow
I'll never let you part
For you're always in my heart[Intro: Chris Tucker & Michael Jackson]
Oh man! Look at that girl, right there!
Goodness gracious! That girl fine, man!
Look at it, she just too fine! She know she fine too!
She is banging!
She's off the hook!
She looks good, you're right
Hey, I bet you, can't nobody get that girl
Chris, I can get her
You can't get that girl, Mike
I guarantee you can't get that girl!
Watch me get that girl
I bet you never-Neverland, you can't
I can get her
All right! Shomon, then, Shomon!
Watch
I don't think they're ready for this one
Darkchild, I like that

[Verse 1]
My life will never be the same
'Cause girl, you came and changed
The way I walk
The way I talk
I cannot explain these things I feel for you
But girl, you know it's true
Stay with me, fulfill my dreams
And I'll be all you'll need

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, oh, oh, oh, ooh, it feels so right (Girl)
I've searched for the perfect love all my life (All my life)
Oh, oh, oh, oh, ooh, it feels like I (Like I)
Have finally found her perfect love is mine (See)
And I finally found, come on, girl

[Chorus]
You rocked my world, you know you did
And everything I own I give (You rocked my world)
The rarest love who'd think I'd find
Someone like you to call mine (You rocked my world)
You rocked my world, you know you did (Girl)
And everything I own I give (Come on, girl)
The rarest love who'd think I'd find
Someone like you to call mine

[Verse 2]
In time I knew that love would bring
This happiness to me
I tried to keep my sanity
I waited patiently
Girl, you know it seems
My life is so complete
A love that's true because of you
Keep doing what you do

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, oh, oh, oh, who'd think that I (Oh)
Have finally found the perfect love I searched for all my life (Searched for all my life)
Oh, oh, oh, oh, who'd think I'd find

And everything I own I give (You rocked my world)
The rarest love who'd think I'd find
Someone like you to call mine
You rocked my world (Oh), you know you did
And everything I own I give (To rock my world)
The rarest love who'd think I'd find
Someone like you to call mine

[Verse 3]
And girl, I know that this is love
I feel the magic all in the air
And girl, I'll never get enough
That's why I always have to have you here, hoo

[Chorus]
You rocked my world (You rocked my world), you know you did
And everything I own I give (Look what you did to me, baby, yeah)
The rarest love who'd think I'd find
Someone like you to call mine (You rocked my world)
You rocked my world, you know you did (Know you did baby)
And everything I own I give (Cause you rocked my world)
The rarest love who'd think I'd find (Hoo, hoo)
Someone like you to call mine
You rocked my world
(You rocked my world, you know you did)
The way you talk to me, the way you're lovin' me
The way you give it to me
You rocked my world, you know you did
(Give it to me)
(Yeah, yeah, yeah yeah ooh)
You rocked my world (You rocked my world), you know
You did
(You rocked my world, you rocked my world)
(Come on, girl) You rocked my world (Come on, girl)
You know you did

And everything I own I give
The rarest love who'd think I'd find
Someone like you to call mine[Verse 1]
When the world is on your shoulder
Gotta straighten up your act and boogie down
If you can't hang with the feelin'
Then there ain't no room for you in this part of town
'Cause we're the party people night and day
Livin' crazy, that's the only way

[Chorus]
So tonight, gotta leave that nine to five upon the shelf
And just enjoy yourself
Groove, let the madness in the music get to you
Life ain't so bad at all
If you live it off the wall
Life ain't so bad at all (Live life off the wall)
Live your life off the wall (Live it off the wall)

[Verse 2]
You can shout out all you want to
'Cause there ain't no sin in folks all gettin' loud
If you take the chance and do it
Then there ain't no one who's gonna put you down
'Cause we're the party people night and day
Livin' crazy, that's the only way

[Chorus]
So tonight, gotta leave that nine to five upon the shelf
And just enjoy yourself (Come on, and)
Groove, let the madness in the music get to you
Life ain't so bad at all
If you live it off the wall
Life ain't so bad at all (Live life off the wall)
Live your life off the wall (Live it off the wall)

[Bridge]
Do what you want to do
There ain't no rules, it's up to you (Ain't no rules, it's all up to you)
It's time to come alive
And party on right through the night (All right)

[Verse 3]
Gotta hide your inhibitions
Gotta let that fool loose deep inside your soul
Wanna see an exhibition (Ahee)
Better do it now before you get too old
'Cause we're the party people night and day
Livin' crazy, that's the only way

[Chorus]
So tonight, gotta leave that nine to five upon the shelf
And just enjoy yourself (Come on, and)
Groove, let the madness in the music get to you
Life ain't so bad at all
If you live it off the wall
Life ain't so bad at all (Live life off the wall)
Live your life off the wall
So tonight, gotta leave that nine to five upon the shelf
And just enjoy yourself (Come on, and)
Groove, let the madness in the music get to you
Life ain't so bad at all
If you live it off the wall
Tonight, gotta leave that nine to five upon the shelf (Yeah)
And just enjoy yourself (Come on, and)
Groove, let the madness in the music get to you
Life ain't so bad at all (Wanna live)
Tonight, gotta leave that nine to five upon the shelf (Nine to five)
And just enjoy yourself (Come on, and)
Groove, let the madness in the music get to you
Life ain't so bad at all (Yeah)[Verse 1: Michael and Janet]
I'm tired of injustice, I'm tired of the schemes
The lies are disgusting, so what does it mean, damn it?
You're kicking me down, I got to get up
As jacked as it sounds, the whole system sucks, damn it!
Peek in the shadow, come into the light
You tell me I'm wrong, then you better prove you're right!
You're selling out souls but I care about mine
I've got to get stronger, and I won't give up the fight!

[Pre-Chorus: Michael and Janet]
With such confusion don't it make you want to scream? (Make you want to scream?)
Your bash abusing victimize within the scheme!
You try to cope with every lie they scrutinize!

[Chorus: Both]
Somebody please have mercy, cause I just can't take it!
Stop pressuring me, just stop pressuring me
Stop pressuring me, make me want to scream!
Stop pressuring me, just stop pressuring me
Stop pressuring me, make you just want to scream!

[Verse 2: Michael and Janet]
I'm tired of you telling, the story your way
You're causing confusion, you think it's okay, damn it!
You keep changing the rules, while I'm playing the game
I can't take it much longer, I think I might go insane!

[Pre-Chorus: Michael and Janet]
With such confusion don't it make you want to scream?
Make you want to scream?
Your bash abusing victimize within the scheme!
You find your pleasure scandalizing every lie

[Chorus: Both]
Oh Father, please have mercy, cause I just can't take it!
Stop pressuring me, just stop pressuring me
Stop pressuring me, make me want to scream!
Stop pressuring me, just stop pressuring me
Stop fuckin' with me, make me want to scream!

[Bridge: Janet]
Oh my God, can't believe what I saw as I turned the TV
This evening, I was disgusted by all the injustice, all the injustice! (All the injustice)
(A man has been brutally beaten to death by police
After being wrongly
Identified as a robbery suspect!
The man was an 18 year-old black male!)

[Pre-Chorus: Michael and Janet]
With such delusions don't it make you want to scream? (Make you want to scream?)
Your bash abusing victimize within the scheme!
You try to cope with every lie they scrutinize!

[Outro: Both]
Oh brother please have mercy, cause I just can't take it!
Stop pressuring me, just stop pressuring me
Stop pressuring me, make me want to scream!
Stop pressuring me, just stop pressuring me
Stop pressuring me, make me want to scream!
Stop pressuring me, just stop pressuring me
Stop pressuring me, make me want to scream!
Stop pressuring me, just stop pressuring me
Stop pressuring me, make me want to scream![Verse 1: Michael Jackson]
Every night she walks right in my dreams
Since I met her from the start
I'm so proud I am the only one
Who is special in her heart

[Hook: Michael Jackson]
The girl is mine
The doggone girl is mine, m-m-m
I know she's mine
Because the doggone girl is mine m-m-m

[Verse 2: Paul McCartney]
I don't understand the way you think
Saying that she's yours, not mine
Sending roses and your silly dreams
Really just a waste of time

[Hook: Paul McCartney]
Because she's mine
The doggone girl is mine
Don't waste your time
Because the doggone girl is mine

[Verse 3: Michael + Paul]
I love you more than he
(Take you anywhere)
Well I love you endlessly
(Loving we will share)
So come and go with me
To one's town

[Bridge: Micheal Jackson]
But we both cannot have her
So it's one or the other
And one day you'll discover
That she's my girl forever and ever

[Verse 4: Michael + Paul]
Don't build your hopes to be let down
'Cause I really feel it's time
I know she'll tell you I'm the one for her
'Cause she said I blow her mind

[Hook: Michael Jackson]
The girl is mine
The doggone girl is mine
Don't waste your time
Because the doggone girl is mine

[Refrain: Michael + Paul]
She's mine, she's mine
No, no, no, she's mine
The girl is mine, the girl is mine
The girl is mine, the girl is mine
The girl is mine (mine, mine); yep, she's mine (mine, mine)
The girl is mine (mine, mine); yeah, she's mine (mine, mine)

[Hook: Michael Jackson]
Don't waste your time
Because the doggone girl is mine
The girl is mine, the girl is mine

[Interlude: Michael + Paul]
Michael, we're not going to fight about this, okay?
Ha, ha, Paul, I think I told you I'm a lover, not a fighter
Eh, I've heard it all before, Michael
She told me that I'm her forever lover, you know, don't you remember?
Well, after loving me she said she couldn't love another
Is that what she said?
Yeah, she said it; you keep dreaming

[Outro: Michael + (Paul)]
(I don't believe it!) (Mine, mine)
(No, no, no) The girl is mine (Mine, mine, mine)
(No, mine) No, mine (Mine, mine)
(She's mine, mine, mine, mine, mine) (Mine, mine, mine)
'Cause the girl is mine
(No, the girl is mine) (Mine, mine)
The girl is mine (Mine, mine, mine)
(No, the girl is mine)
The girl is mine (Mine, mine)
(No, she's mine)[Intro]

You came and you changed me, girl
A feeling so true

[Hook]

I was wandering in the rain
Mask of life, feeling insane
Swift and sudden fall from grace
Sunny days seem far away
Kremlin's shadow belittling me
Stalin's tomb won't let me be
On and on and on it came
Wish the rain would just let me

[Chorus]
How does it feel (How does it feel?)
How does it feel
How does it feel
When you're alone
And you're cold inside?

[Verse 2]
Here abandoned in my fame
Armageddon of the brain
KGB was dogging me
Take my name and just let me be
Then a beggar boy called my name
Happy days will drown the pain
On and on and on it came and again, and again, and again
Take my name and just let me

[Chorus]
How does it feel (How does it feel?)
How does it feel
How does it feel
How does it feel
How does it feel (How does it feel now?)
How does it feel
How does it feel
When you're alone
And you're cold inside?

[Chorus]
How does it feel (How does it feel?)
How does it feel
How does it feel
How does it feel
How does it feel (How does it feel now?)
How does it feel
How does it feel
When you're alone
And you're cold inside?

[Outro]
Like a stranger in Moscow
Lord have mercy
Like a stranger in Moscow
Lord have mercy
We're talking danger
We're talking danger, baby
Like a stranger in Moscow
We're talking danger
We're talking danger, baby
Like a stranger in Moscow
I'm living lonely
I'm living lonely, baby
Stranger in Moscow

[KGB interrogator - Russian to English Translation]
Why have you come from the West
Confess, to steal the great achievements of the people
The accomplishments of the worker[Intro]
I just want to lay next to you for a while
You look so beautiful tonight
Your eyes are so lovely
Your mouth is so sweet
A lot of people misunderstand me
That's because they don't know me at all
I just want to touch you
And hold you
I need you, God I need you
I love you so much

[Verse 1: Michael & Siedah]
Each time the wind blows
I hear your voice so
I call your name
Whispers at morning
Our love is dawning
Heaven's glad you came
You know how I feel
This thing can't go wrong
I'm so proud to say I love you
Your love's got me high
I long to get by
This time is forever
Love is the answer
I hear your voice now
You are my choice now
The love you bring
Heaven's in my heart
At your call, I hear harps
And angels sing
You know how I feel
This thing can't go wrong
I can't live my life without you
I just can't hold on
I feel we belong
My life ain't worth living
If I can't be with you

[Chorus: Both & Siedah]
I just can't stop loving you
I just can't stop loving you
And if I stop
Then tell me just what will I do
Cause I just can't stop loving you

[Verse 2: Michael & Siedah & Both]
At night when the stars shine
I pray in you I'll find
A love so true
When morning awakes me
Will you come and take me
I'll wait for you
You know how I feel
I won't stop until
I hear your voice saying, "I do"
"I do"
This thing can't go wrong
This feeling's so strong
Well, my Life ain't worth living
If I can't be with you

[Chorus: Michael & Both]
I just can't stop loving you
I just can't stop loving you
And if I stop
Then tell me just what will I do
I just can't stop loving you

[Bridge: Michael & Siedah & Both]
We can change all the world tomorrow
We can sing songs of yesterday
I can say, "Hey, Farewell" to sorrow
This is my life and I
Want to see you for always

[Chorus: Both]
I just can't stop loving you (No, baby)
I just can't stop loving you (If I can't stop)
And if I stop
Then tell me just what will I do (What will I do?)
I just can't stop loving you (Without you, girl)
I just can't stop loving you (You know I do)
And if I stop
Then tell me just what will I do[Spoken Intro]
The way she came into the place
I knew right then and there
There was something different
About this girl

The way she moved
Her hair, her face, her lines
Divinity in motion

As she stalked the room
I could feel the aura
Of her presence
Every head turned
Feeling passion and lust

The girl was persuasive
The girl I could not trust
The girl was bad
The girl was dangerous

[Verse 1]
I never knew but I was
Walking the line
Come go with me
I said I have no time
She said don't you pretend we didn't
Talk on the phone
My baby cried
She left me standing alone

[Chorus]
She's so dangerous
The girl is so dangerous
Take away my money
Throw away my time
You can call me honey
But you're no damn good for me

[Spoken Interlude]
She came at me in sections
With the eyes of desire
I fell trapped into her
Web of sin
A touch
A kiss
A whisper of love
I was at the point
Of no return

Deep in the darkness of
Passion's insanity
I felt taken by lust's
Strange inhumanity
This girl was persuasive
This girl I could not trust
The girl was bad
The girl was dangerous

[Verse 2]
I never knew
But I was living in vain
She called my house
She said you know my name
And don't you pretend
You never did me before
With tears in her eyes
My baby walked out the door

[Chorus]
She's so dangerous
The girl is so dangerous
Take away my money
Throw away my time
You can call me honey
But you're no damn good for me

[Alternate Chorus]
Dangerous
The girl is so dangerous
I have to pray to God
Cause I know how
Lust can blind
It's a passion in my soul
But you're no damn lover
Friend of mine

[Bridge]
I cannot sleep alone at night
My baby left me here tonight
I cannot cope 'til it's all right
You and your manipulation
You hurt my baby

[Spoken Interlude]
And then it happened
She touched me
For the lips of
A strange woman
Drop as a honeycomb
And her mouth was
Smoother than oil
But her inner spirit and words
Were as sharp as
A two-edged sword
But I loved it
Cause it's dangerous

[Chorus]
Dangerous
The girl is so dangerous
Take away my money
Throw away my time
You can call me honey
But you're no damn good for me

Dangerous
The girl is so dangerous
Take away my money
Throw away my time
You can call me honey
But you're no damn good for me

Dangerous
The girl is so dangerous
Take away my money
Throw away my time
You can call me honey
But you're no damn good for me

[Alternate Chorus]
Dangerous
The girl is so dangerous
I have to pray to God
Cause I know how
Lust can blind
It's a passion in my soul
But you're no damn lover
Friend of mine

Time after time I gave you all of my money
No excuses to make
Ain't no mountain that I can't climb baby
All is going my way

[Pre-Chorus]
('Cause there's a time when you're right
And you know you must fight)
Who's laughing, baby? Don't you know

And this choice you will take)
Who's laughing, baby?

[Chorus]
So just leave me alone, girl (leave me alone, leave me alone)
Leave me alone
Leave me alone, girl (leave me alone, leave me alone, leave me alone)
Leave me alonestop it!
Just stop dogging me around (just stop dogging me)

[Verse 2]
There was a time I used to say "Girl, I need you"
But who is sorry now?
You really hurt, you used to take and deceive me
Now who is sorry now?
You got a way of making me feel so sorry
I found out right away
Don't you come walking, begging, I aint loving you
Don't you get in my way

[Pre-Chorus]
('Cause there's a time when you're right
And you know you must fight)
Who's laughing, baby? Don't you know

Leave me alone, girl (leave me alone, leave me alone, leave me alone)
Leave me alonestop it!
Just stop dogging me around

[Outro]
Don't come begging me
Don't come begging
Don't come loving me
Don't come begging
I love you
I don't want it
I don't, I don't, I don't, I, aow!
Hee-hee!
Don't come begging me
Don't come begging
Don't come loving me
Don't come begging
I love you
I don't want it
I don't need it[Verse 1]
I gave her money
I gave her time
I gave her everything
Inside one heart could find
I gave her passion
My very soul
I gave her promises
And secrets so untold

[Pre-Chorus]
And she promised me forever
And a day wed live as one
We made our vows
Wed live a life anew
And she promised me in secret
That she'd love me for all time
Its a promise so untrue
Tell me what will I do?

[Chorus]
And it doesn't seem to matter
And it doesn't seem right
Cause the will has brought no fortune
Still I cry alone at night
Don't you judge of my composure
Cause I'm lying to myself
And the reason why she left me
Did she find in someone else?

(Who is it?)
It is a friend of mine?
(Who is it?)
Is it my brother?
(Who is it?)
Somebody hurt my soul, now
(Who is it?)
I cant take this stuff no more

[Verse 2]
I am the damned
I am the dead
I am the agony inside
The dying head
This is injustice
Woe unto thee
I pray this punishment
Would have mercy on me

[Pre-Chorus]
And she promised me forever
That we'd live our life as one
We made our vows
We'd live a love so true
It seems that she has left me
For such reasons unexplained
I need to find the truth
But see what will I do

[Chorus]
And it doesn't seem to matter
And it doesn't seem right
Cause the will has brought no fortune
Still I cry alone at night
Don't you judge of my composure
Cause I'm bothered everyday
And she didn't leave a letter
She just up and ran away

(Who is it?)
It is a friend of mine?
(Who is it?)
Is it my brother?
(Who is it?)
Somebody hurt my soul, now
(Who is it?)
I can't take it cause I'm lonely

(Who is it?)
It is a friend of mine?
(Who is it?)
Tell me, I'm bothered!
(Who is it?)
Somebody hurt my soul, now
(Who is it?)
I can't take it cause I'm lonely

[Chorus]
And it doesn't seem to matter
And it doesn't seem right
Cause the will has brought no fortune
Still I cry alone at night
Don't you judge of my composure
Cause I'm lying to myself
And the reason why she left me
Did she find in someone else?

[Chorus]
And it doesn't seem to matter
And it doesn't seem right
Cause the will has brought no fortune
Still I cry alone at night
Don't you judge of my composure
Cause I'm bothered everyday
And she didn't leave a letter
She just up and ran away

And it doesn't seem to matter
And it doesn't seem right
Cause the will has brought no fortune
Still I cry alone at night
Don't you judge of my composure
Cause I'm lying to myself
And the reason why she left me
Did she find in someone else?

And it doesn't seem to matter
And it doesn't seem right
Cause the will has brought no fortune
Still I cry alone at night
Don't you judge of my composure
Cause I'm bothered everyday
And she didn't leave a letter
She just up and ran away

And it doesn't seem to matter
And it doesn't seem right
Cause the will has brought no fortune
Still I cry alone at night
Don't you judge of my composure
Cause I'm bothered everyday
And she didn't leave a letter
She just up and ran away

And it doesn't seem to matter
And it doesn't seem right
Cause the will has brought no fortune
Still I cry alone at night
Don't you judge of my composure
Cause I'm lying to myself
And the reason why she left me
Did she find in someone else?
(Can't take it cause I'm lonely)[Spoken Intro: Princess Stephanie of Monaco]
There is something
I have to say to you
If you promise you'll
Understand
I cannot contain myself
When in your presence
I'm so humble
Touch me
Don't hide our love
Woman to man

[Verse 1: Michael Jackson]
She's just a lover
Who's doing me by
It's worth the giving
It's worth the try
You cannot cleave it
Or put it in the furnace
You cannot wet it
You cannot burn it

[Refrain: Michael Jackson]
She wants to give it
(She wants to give it)
(Ahh, she wants to give it)
(She wants to give it)
(Ahh, she wants to give it)
She wants to give it
(She wants to give it)
(Ahh, she wants to give it)
(She wants to give it)
(Ahh, she wants to give it)

[Verse 2: Michael Jackson]
It's just a feeling
You have to soothe it
You can't neglect it
You can't abuse it
It's just desire
You cannot waste it
Then, if you want it
Then, won't you taste it

[Refrain: Michael Jackson]
She wants to give it
(She wants to give it)
(Ahh, she wants to give it)

[Pre-Chorus: Princess Stephanie of Monaco]
One thing in life you must understand
The truth of lust, woman to man
So open the door and you will see
There are no secrets
Make your move
Set me free

[Chorus: Michael Jackson]
Because there's something about you baby
That makes me want to give it to you
I swear there's something about you baby
Just promise me whatever we say
Or whatever we do to each other
For now we will be making a vow, to just
Keep it in the closet

[Verse 3: Michael Jackson + Princess Stephanie of Monaco]
If you can get it
It is worth a try
I really want it
I can't deny
It's just desire
I really love it
'Cause if it's aching
You have to rub it

[Refrain: Michael Jackson]
She wants to give it
(She wants to give it)
(Ahh, she wants to give it)
(She wants to give it)
(Ahh, she wants to give it)
She wants to give it
(She wants to give it)
(Ahh, she wants to give it)
(She wants to give it)
(Ahh, she wants to give it)

[Verse 4: Princess Stephanie of Monaco]
Just open the door and you will see
This passion burns inside of me
Don't say to me you'll never tell
Touch me there
Make the move
Cast the spell

[Chorus: Michael Jackson]
Because there's something about you baby
That makes me want to give it to you
I swear there's something about you baby
That makes me want
Just promise me whatever we say
Or do to each other
For now we'll make a vow, to just
Keep it in the closet

[Instrumental]

[Chorus: Michael Jackson]
Because there's something about you baby
That makes me want to give it to you
Because there's something about you baby
That makes me want to give it to you
I swear there's something about you baby
That makes me want to give it to you
I swear there's something about you baby
That makes me want to give it to you
I swear there's something about you baby
That makes me want to give it to you
There's something about you baby
That makes me want

Just promise me whatever we say
Or whatever we do to each other
For now we'll make a vow to just
Keep it in the closet

Ahh, she wants to give it[Verse 1]
Nation to nation, all the world must come together
Face the problems that we see then maybe somehow we can work it out
I asked my neighbor for a favor, she said later
What has come of all the people, have we lost love of what it's about?
I have to find my peace cause no one seems to let me be
False prophets cry of doom, what are the possibilities?
I told my brother there'll be problems, times and tears for fears
But we must live each day like it's the last
Go with it, go with it

[Verse 2]
The world keeps changing, rearranging minds and thoughts
Predictions fly of doom, the baby boom has come of age, we'll work it out
I told my brothers don't you ask me for no favors
I'm conditioned by the system, don't you talk to me, don't scream and shout
She prays to God, to Buddha, then she sings a Talmud song
Confusions contradict the self, do we know right from wrong?
I just want you to recognize me in the temple
You can't hurt me, I've found peace within myself
Go with it, go with it

Hot damn, the big boy stands with an upper hand
Makin' funky tracks with my man Michael Jackson
Smooth criminal, that's the man cause Mike's so relaxed

Yeah, yeah, ah

[Verse 1]
Now I'm just wonderin', dah, why you think, dah
That you can get to me, dah, with anything, dah
Seems like you'd know by now, when and how I get down, dah
And with all that I've been through, dah, I'm still around

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't you ever make no mistake
Baby, I've got what it takes
And there's no way you'll ever get to me
Why can't you see that you'll never ever hurt me?
'Cause I won't let it be, see I'm too much for you, baby

[Chorus]
You can't believe it, dah, you can't conceive it
And you can't touch me, dah, 'cause I'm untouchable
And I know you hate it, dah, and you can't take it
You'll never break me, dah, 'cause I'm unbreakable

[Break]
Oh, dah, ah, well, ah, ah

[Verse 2: Michael Jackson]
Now you can't stop me, dah, even though you think
That if you block me, dah, you've done your thing, ah
And when you bury me underneath all your pain
I'm steady laughin', hah, while surfacing

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't you ever make no mistake
Baby I've got what it takes (Yeah)
And there's no way you'll ever get to me (You can't do it, baby)
Why can't you see that you'll never ever hurt me (Come on)
'Cause I won't let it be, see I'm too much for you baby

You can't believe it, dah, you can't conceive it
And you can't touch me, dah, 'cause I'm untouchable

You'll never break me, dah, 'cause I'm unbreakable

[Bridge: Michael Jackson & The Notorious B.I.G]
You can try to stop me, dah, but it won't do a thing
No matter what you do, I'm still gonna be here
Through all your lies and silly games
I'ma still remain the same, I'm (Uh) un- (Uh) breakable (What? Uh)

[Verse 3: Notorious B.I.G.]
A lime to a lemon, my D.C. women
Bringing in 10 G minimums to condos with elevators in 'em
Vehicles with televisions in 'em
Watch they entourage turn yours to just mirages
Disappearing acts, strictly 9's and MAC's
Killers be serial, Copperfield material
My dreams is vivid, work hard to live it
Any place I visit, I got land there
How can players stand there and say I sound like them? Hello
Push wigs back and push six Coupes that's yellow
Plus clips that expand from hand to elbow
Spray up your Day's Inn, any 'tel you in
Crack braggin', sick of braggin' how my mink be draggin'
Desert ease street sweeper inside the Beamer wagon
I rely on Bed-Stuy to shut it down if I die
Put that on my diamond bezel, you're messin' with the devil
What

[Chorus]
You can't believe it, dah, you can't conceive it (Yeah)
And you can't touch me (I'm untouchable), dah, 'cause I'm untouchable
And I know you hate it, dah, and you can't take it (Yeah)
You'll never break me, dah, 'cause I'm unbreakable (I'm unbreakable)
You can't believe it, dah, you can't conceive it (You, you, you, you, you)
And you can't touch me, dah, 'cause I'm untouchable (And I know)
And I know you hate it (You hate it), dah, and you can't take it (Hoo)
You'll never break me (I'm unbreakable), dah, 'cause I'm unbreakable
You can't believe it (Hoo-hoo-hoo), dah, you can't conceive it
And you can't touch me, dah, 'cause I'm untouchable
And I know you hate it (Why did you do it?), dah, and you can't take it (Just why did you do it? Hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo)
You'll never break me
You can't touch me, you can't break me
You can't stand that [?] unbreakable, ooh!

[Outro]
Gone![Verse 1]
Ben, the two of us need look no more
We both found what we were looking for
With a friend to call my own
I'll never be alone
And you my friend will see
You've got a friend in me
(You've got a friend in me)

[Verse 2]
Ben, you are always running here and there
(Here and there)
You feel you're not wanted anywhere
(Anywhere)
If you ever look behind
And don't like what you find
There's something you should know
You've got a place to go
(You've got a place to go)

[Verse 3]
I used to say "I" and "me"
Now it's "us", now it's "we"
I used to say "I" and "me"
Now it's "us", now it's "we"

[Verse 4]
Ben, most people would turn you away
I don't listen to a word they say
They don't see you as I do
I wish they would try to
I am sure they'd think again
If they had a friend like Ben
(A friend)
Like Ben
(Like Ben)
Like Ben[Verse 1]
She always takes it with a heart of stone
'Cause all she does is throw it back to me
I've spent a lifetime looking for someone
Don't try to understand me
Just simply do the things I say

[Chorus]
Love is a feeling
Give it when I want it
'Cause I'm on fire
Quench my desire
Give it when I want it
Talk to me, woman
Give in to me, give in to me

[Verse 2]
You always knew just how to make me cry
And never did I ask you questions why
It seems you get your kicks from hurting me
Don't try to understand me
Because your words just aren't enough

[Chorus]
Love is a feeling
Quench my desire
Give it when I want It
Taking me higher
Love is a woman
I don't wanna hear it
Give in to me, give in to me

[Bridge]
You and your friends were laughing at me in town
But it's okay and it's okay
You won't be laughing girl when I'm not around
I'll be okay
And I'd, I'd never find
Better, a peace of mind, no

[Guitar Solo]

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't try to tell me
Because your words just aren't enough

Give in to me, give in to me, give in to me

Takin' me higher
Tell it to the preacher
Satisfy the feeling
Give in to me, give in to me

[Guitar Solo]

[Outro]
I don't wanna, I don't wanna, I don't wanna hear it
Give in to the fire
Talk to me, woman
Quench my desire
I'd like a lady
Talk to me baby
Give in to me
Give in to the fire
Give in to me
Give in to me
Give in to me
Love is a woman
Give in to me

Since you seduced her, ah
How does it feel? Ah
To know that woman, ah
Is out to kill

Every night stance is like taking a chance
It's not about love and romance
And now you're going to get it
Ah, every hot man is out taking a chance
It's not about love and romance

[Pre-Chorus]
To escape the world, I've got to enjoy that simple dance
And it seemed that everything was on my side

She seemed sincere like it was love and true romance
And now she's out to get me
But I just can't take it
Just can't break it

[Chorus]
Susie got your number and Susie aint your friend
Look who took you under with seven inches in
Blood is on the dance floor, blood is on the knife
Susie's got your number and Susie says it's right

There'll be no more mountains for us to climb
(I can't be still, you thrill me, baby, be mine)
This will be a love lasting for all time

Hold me, only you and I can make sweet love this way
There's no more I can say-

[Chorus]
So baby, be mine (baby be mine, baby you got to be mine)
Ow! (tell me that you love me all the time)
And girl I'll give you all I got to give (say you're thinking of me)

And all you got to do is not answer my calls when I'm tryna get through
Keep me wondering why, when all I can do is sigh
I just wanna touch you

[Chorus]
I just wanna touch and kiss
And I wish that I could be with you tonight (And I wish I could be with you)
(Girl, you give me) 'Cause you give me butterflies inside, inside and I

[Verse 2]
All I got to say is that I must be dreamin', can't be real
You're not here with me, still I can feel you near to me
I caress you, let you taste us, just so blissful, listen
I would give you anything baby, ah, just make my dreams come true
Oh baby, you give me butterflies

[Chorus]
I just wanna touch and kiss
And I wish that I could be with you tonight (You tonight)
'Cause you give me butterflies inside, inside and I
I just wanna touch and kiss
And I wish that I could be with you tonight
(You give me) Ah, 'cause you give me butterflies inside, inside and I

[Bridge]
If you would take my hand, baby, I would show you
Guide you to the light, babe
If you would be my love, baby, I will love you
Love you 'til the end of time

[Chorus]
I just wanna touch and kiss
And I wish that I could be with you tonight (Tonight)
(Girl, you give me) 'Cause you give me butterflies inside, inside and I
I just want to touch and kiss (I wanna, I wanna be with you)
And I wish that I could be with you tonight
Ah, you give me butterflies inside, inside and I
I just wanna touch and kiss
And I wish that I could be with you tonight
Ah, 'cause you give me butterflies inside, inside and I
I just wanna touch and kiss (I wanna, I wanna be with you, girl)
And I wish that I could be with you tonight (I wanna be with you)
'Cause you give me butterflies inside, inside and I[Verse 1: Louis]
I might never be your knight in shining armor
I might never be the one you take home to mother
And I might never be the one who brings you flowers
But I can be the one, be the one tonight

[Pre-Chorus: Liam]
When I first saw you from across the room
I could tell that you were curious, oh yeah
Girl, I hope you're sure what you're looking for
'Cause I'm not good at making promises

[Chorus: Harry + All]
But if you like causing trouble up in hotel rooms
And if you like having secret little rendezvous
If you like to do the things you know that we shouldn't do
Then, baby, I'm perfect
Baby, I'm perfect for you
And if you like midnight driving with the windows down
And if you like going places we can't even pronounce
If you like to do whatever you've been dreaming about
Then, baby, you're perfect
Baby, you're perfect
So let's start right now

[Verse 2: Niall]
I might never be the hands you put your heart in
Or the arms that hold you any time you want them
But that don't mean that we can't live here in the moment
'Cause I can be the one you love from time to time

[Pre-Chorus: Liam]
When I first saw you, from across the room
I could tell that you were curious, oh yeah
Girl, I hope you're sure what you're looking for

If you like to do whatever you've been dreaming about
Then, baby, you're perfect
Baby, you're perfect
So let's start right now

[Bridge: Harry]
And if you like cameras flashing every time we go out, oh yeah
And if you're looking for someone
To write your breakup songs about
Baby, I'm perfect
Baby, we're perfect

If you like causing trouble up in hotel rooms
And if you like having secret little rendezvous
If you like to do the things you know that we shouldn't do

And if you like going places we can't even pronounce
If you like to do whatever you've been dreaming about

So let's start right now[Verse 1: Harry]
I've got fire for a heart, I'm not scared of the dark
You've never seen it look so easy
I got a river for a soul, and baby, you're a boat
Baby, you're my only reason

[Pre-Chorus: Louis]
If I didn't have you there would be nothing left
The shell of a man who could never be his best
If I didn't have you, I'd never see the sun
You taught me how to be someone, yeah

[Chorus: Liam & Niall & (Louis) & Harry]
All my life, you stood by me
When no one else was ever behind me
All these lights, they can't blind me
With your love, nobody can drag me down
All my life, you stood by me
When no one else was ever behind me
All these lights, they can't blind me
With your love, nobody can drag me down

Nobody can drag me down

Nobody can drag me down

The shell of a man who could never be his best (Be his best)

Written in these walls are the stories that I can't explain
I leave my heart open
But it stays right here empty for days
She told me in the morning
She don't feel the same about us in her bones
It seems to me that when I die
These words will be written on my stone

[Pre-Chorus: Zayn Malik]
And I'll be gone, gone tonight
The ground beneath my feet is open wide
The way that I've been holding on too tight
With nothing in between

[Chorus: Harry Styles & All]
The story of my life
I take her home
I drive all night
To keep her warm
And time is frozen (The story of, the story of)
The story of my life
I give her hope
I spend her love
Until she's broke inside
The story of my life (The story of, the story of)

[Verse 2: Niall Horan &  Liam Payne]
Written on these walls are the colours that I can't change
Leave my heart open
But it stays right here in its cage
I know that in the morning, now
I'll see us in the light up on the hill
Although I am broken, my heart is untamed still

[Pre-Chorus: Louis Tomlinson]
And I'll be gone, gone tonight
The fire beneath my feet is burning bright
The way that I've been holding on so tight
With nothing in between

[Chorus: Harry Styles & All]
The story of my life
I take her home
I drive all night
To keep her warm
And time is frozen
The story of my life (The story of, the story of)
I give her hope
I spend her love
Until she's broke inside
The story of my life (The story of, the story of)

[Bridge: Zayn Malik]
And I been waiting for this time to come around
But, baby, running after you
Is like chasing the clouds

[Breakdown: Niall Horan]
The story of my life
I take her home
I drive all night
To keep her warm
And time is frozen

[Chorus: All, & (Zayn)]
The story of my life
I give her hope (Give her hope)
I spend her love
Until she's broke inside
(Until she's broke inside)
The story of my life

[Outro: All, & Harry]
The story of my life
The story of my life
The story of my life[Verse 1: Harry & Niall]
You gotta help me, I'm losing my mind
Keep getting the feeling you wanna leave this all behind
Thought we were going strong
I thought we were holding on
Aren't we?
No, they don't teach you this in school
Now my heart's breaking and I don't know what to do
Thought we were going strong
Thought we were holding on
Aren't we?

[Chorus: All]
You and me got a whole lot of history
We could be the greatest team that the world has ever seen
You and me got a whole lot of history
So don't let it go, we can make some more, we can live forever

[Verse 2: Liam]
All of the rumours, all of the fights
But we always find a way to make it out alive
Thought we were going strong
Thought we were holding on
Aren't we?

[Chorus: All]
You and me got a whole lot of history
We could be the greatest team that the world has ever seen
You and me got a whole lot of history
So don't let it go, we can make some more, we can live forever

[Bridge: Louis]
Minibars, expensive cars
Hotel rooms, and new tattoos
The good champagne and private planes
But they don't mean anything
'Cause the truth is out, I realize
That without you here, life is just a lie
This is not the end, this is not the end
We can make it, you know it, you know

[Chorus: All]
You and me got a whole lot of history
We could be the greatest team that the world has ever seen
You and me got a whole lot of history
So don't let it go, we can make some more, we can live forever
You and me got a whole lot of history
We could be the greatest team that the world has ever seen
You and me got a whole lot of history
So don't let it go, we can make some more, we can live forever

[Outro: Harry & All & Liam]
So don't let me go, so don't let me go
We can live forever
Baby don't you know, baby don't you know
We can live forever[Verse 1: Zayn & Liam & Both]
Your hand fits in mine like it's made just for me
But bear this in mind it was meant to be
And I'm joining up the dots with the freckles on your cheeks
And it all makes sense to me
I know you've never loved the crinkles by your eyes
When you smile, you've never loved your stomach or your thighs
The dimples in your back at the bottom of your spine
But Ill love them endlessly

[Chorus: Zayn and Liam]
I won't let these little things slip out of my mouth
But if I do, it's you, oh it's you, they add up to
I'm in love with you and all these little things

[Verse 2: Louis & Harry & Harry and Louis & Harry and Niall]
You can't go to bed without a cup of tea
Maybe that's the reason that you talk in your sleep
And all those conversations are the secrets that I keep
Though it makes no sense to me
I know you've never loved the sound of your voice on tape
You never want to know how much you weigh
You still have to squeeze into your jeans
But you're perfect to me

[Chorus: Harry and Niall & Harry]
I won't let these little things slip out of my mouth
But if it's true, it's you, it's you, they add up to
I'm in love with you and all these little things

[Bridge: Niall]
You never love yourself half as much as I love you
And you'll never treat yourself right darling but I want you to
If I let you know, I'm here for you
Maybe you'll love yourself like I love you, oh

[Chorus: Harry & All]
And I've just let these little things slip out of my mouth
'Cause it's you, oh it's you, it's you they add up to
And I'm in love with you and all these little things
I won't let these little things slip out of my mouth
But if it's true, it's you, it's you they add up to
I'm in love with you, and all your little things[Verse 1: Liam]
You're insecure, don't know what for
You're turning heads when you walk through the door
Don't need makeup to cover up
Being the way that you are is enough

[Pre-Chorus: Harry]
Everyone else in the room can see it
Everyone else but you

[Chorus: All & Harry]
Baby, you light up my world like nobody else
The way that you flip your hair gets me overwhelmed
But when you smile at the ground, it ain't hard to tell
You don't know, oh, oh, you don't know you're beautiful
If only you saw what I can see
You'll understand why I want you so desperately
Right now I'm looking at you and I can't believe
You don't know, you don't know you're beautiful
That's what makes you beautiful

[Verse 2: Zayn]
So c-come on, you got it wrong
To prove I'm right, I put it in a song
I don't know why you're being shy
And turn away when I look into your eyes

[Pre-Chorus: Harry]
Everyone else in the room can see it
Everyone else but you

[Chorus: All & Harry & (Zayn)]
Baby, you light up my world like nobody else (Nobody else)
The way that you flip your hair gets me overwhelmed
But when you smile at the ground, it ain't hard to tell
You don't know, oh, oh, you don't know you're beautiful (Oh)
If only you saw what I can see
You'll understand why I want you so desperately
Right now I'm looking at you and I can't believe
You don't know, you don't know you're beautiful
That's what makes you beautiful

[Bridge: All]
Na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na
Na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na

[Breakdown: Harry]
Baby, you light up my world like nobody else
The way that you flip your hair gets me overwhelmed
But when you smile at the ground, it ain't hard to tell
You don't know, oh-oh, you don't know you're beautiful

[Chorus: All & Harry & (Zayn)]
Baby, you light up my world like nobody else
The way that you flip your hair gets me overwhelmed
But when you smile at the ground (ground), it ain't hard to tell
You don't know, oh-oh, you don't know you're beautiful (Beautiful)
If only you saw what I can see
You'll understand why I want you so desperately (Desperately)
Right now I'm looking at you and I can't believe
You don't know, oh-oh, you don't know you're beautiful
Oh-oh-oh, you don't know you're beautiful, oh-oh
That's what makes you beautiful

[Written By Savan Kotecha][Verse 1: Niall]
Down to Earth
Keep on falling when I know it hurts
Going faster than a million miles an hour
Tryna catch my breath some way, somehow
Down to Earth
It's like I'm frozen, but the world still turns
Stuck in motion, and the wheels keep spinning 'round
Moving in reverse with no way out

[Pre-Chorus: Liam]
And now I'm one step closer to being
Two steps far from you
When everybody wants you
Everybody wants you

[Chorus: Harry & All]
How many nights does it take to count the stars?
That's the time it would take to fix my heart
Oh, baby, I was there for you
All I ever wanted was the truth, yeah, yeah
How many nights have you wished someone would stay?
Lie awake only hoping they're okay
I have never counted all of mine
If I tried, I know it would feel like infinity
Infinity, infinity, yeah
Infinity

[Verse 2: Liam]
Eyes can't shine
Unless there's something burning bright behind
Since you went away, there's nothing left in mine
I feel myself running out of time

[Pre-Chorus: Louis]
And now I'm one step closer to being
Two steps far from you
When everybody wants you
Everybody wants you

[Chorus: Harry & All]
How many nights does it take to count the stars?
That's the time it would take to fix my heart
Oh, baby, I was there for you
All I ever wanted was the truth, yeah, yeah
How many nights have you wished someone would stay?
Lie awake only hoping they're okay
I have never counted all of mine
If I tried, I know it would feel like infinity
Infinity, infinity, yeah
Infinity, infinity, infinity
How many nights does it take to count the stars?
That's the time it would take to fix my heart
Oh, baby, I was there for you
All I ever wanted was the truth, yeah, yeah
How many nights have you wished someone would stay?
Lie awake only hoping they're okay
I have never counted all of mine
If I tried, I know it would feel like Infinity (infinity)
Infinity (infinity), Infinity, yeah
Infinity[Verse 1: Zayn  & Liam]
Going out tonight, changes into something red
Her mother doesn't like that kind of dress
Everything she never had, she's showing off
Driving too fast, moon is breaking through her hair
She's heading for something that she won't forget
Having no regrets is all that she really wants

[Chorus: Harry]
We're only getting older, baby
And I've been thinking about it lately
Does it ever drive you crazy
Just how fast the night changes?
Everything that you've ever dreamed of
Disappearing when you wake up
But there's nothing to be afraid of
Even when the night changes, it will never change me and you

[Verse 2: Louis & Niall]
Chasing her tonight, doubts are running 'round her head
He's waiting, hides behind a cigarette
Heart is beating loud and she doesn't want it to stop
Moving too fast, moon is lighting up her skin
She's falling, doesn't even know it yet
Having no regrets is all that she really wants

[Chorus: Harry]
We're only getting older, baby
And I've been thinking about it lately
Does it ever drive you crazy
Just how fast the night changes?
Everything that you've ever dreamed of
Disappearing when you wake up
But there's nothing to be afraid of
Even when the night changes, it will never change me and you

[Bridge: Zayn]
Going out tonight, changes into something red, her mother doesn't like that kind of dress
Reminds her of the missing piece of innocence she lost

[Chorus: Harry]
We're only getting older, baby
And I've been thinking about it lately
Does it ever drive you crazy
Just how fast the night changes?
Everything that you've ever dreamed of
Disappearing when you wake up
But there's nothing to be afraid of
Even when the night changes
It will never change, baby, it will never change, baby
It will never change, me and you[Verse 1: Harry]
If I could fly
I'd be coming right back home to you
I think I might give up everything
Just ask me to

[Pre-Chorus: Liam]
Pay attention, I hope that you listen
'Cause I let my guard down
Right now, I'm completely defenseless

[Chorus: Harry]
For your eyes only, I show you my heart
For when you're lonely and forget who you are
I'm missing half of me when we're apart
Now you know me, for your eyes only
For your eyes only

[Verse 2: Louis]
I've got scars
Even though they can't always be seen
And pain gets hard
But now you're here and I don't feel a thing

[Pre-Chorus: Niall]
Pay attention, I hope that you listen
'Cause I let my guard down
Right now, I'm completely defenseless

[Chorus: All]
For your eyes only, I show you my heart
For when you're lonely and forget who you are
I'm missing half of me when we're apart
Now you know me, for your eyes only
For your eyes only

[Bridge: Louis & Harry & (All)]
I can feel your heart inside of mine
(I feel it, I feel it)
I've been going out of my mind
(I feel it, I feel it)
Know that I'm just wasting time, and I
Hope that you don't run from me

[Breakdown: Louis & Liam & Niall &  (Harry) & (All)]
For your eyes only
I show you my heart
(For when you're lonely)
And forget who you are
(I'm missing half of me)
(When we're apart
Now you know me, for your eyes only)

[Chorus: All]
For your eyes only, I show you my heart
For when you're lonely and forget who you are
I'm missing half of me when we're apart
Now you know me, for your eyes only

[Outro: All & (Harry)]
For your eyes only
(For your eyes only)[Verse 1: Niall & Liam]
I figured it out
I figured it out from black and white
Seconds and hours
Maybe they had to take some time
I know how it goes
I know how it goes from wrong and right
Silence and sound
Did they ever hold each other tight like us?
Did they ever fight like us?

[Chorus: Harry]
You and I, we don't wanna be like them
We can make it 'til the end
Nothing can come between you and I
Not even the Gods above
Can separate the two of us
No, nothing can come between you and I
Oh, you and I

[Verse 2: Zayn, Niall and Liam & Louis, Niall and Liam]
I figured it out
Saw the mistakes of up and down
Meet in the middle
There's always room for common ground
I see what it's like
I see what it's like for day and night
Never together
'Cause they see things in a different light like us
They never tried like us

[Chorus: Harry & Zayn]
You and I, we don't wanna be like them
We can make it 'til the end
Nothing can come between you and I
Not even the Gods above
Can separate the two of us
(Two of us, two of us, two of us, two of us)
'Cause you and I
We don't wanna be like them
We can make it 'til the end (until the end)
Nothing can come between you and I (Nothing can come between)
Not even the Gods above
Can separate the two of us (two of us)
No, nothing can come between you and I
You and I
Oh, you and I
Oh, you and I
We could make it if we try, you and I
Oh, you and I[Verse 1: Harry]
I got a heart and I got a soul
Believe me, I will use them both
We made a start, be it a false one I know
Baby, I don't want to feel alone

[Pre-Chorus: Zayn]
So kiss me where I lay down
My hands pressed to your cheeks
A long way from the playground

[Chorus: Harry]
I have loved you since we were eighteen
Long before we both thought the same thing
To be loved and to be in love
All I can do is say that these arms were made for holding you
I wanna love like you made me feel
When we were eighteen

[Verse 2: Niall & Liam]
We took a chance, God knows we've tried
Yet all along, I knew we'd be fine
So pour me a drink, oh love
Let's split the night wide open
And we'll see everything we can
Living love in slow motion, motion, motion

[Pre-Chorus: Zayn]
So kiss me where I lay down
My hands pressed to your cheeks
A long way from the playground

[Chorus: All & Niall]
I have loved you since we were eighteen
Long before we both thought the same thing
To be loved and to be in love
All I can do is say that these arms were made for holding you
And I wanna love like you made me feel
When we were eighteen
When we were eighteen
Oh Lord, when we were eighteen

[Bridge: Zayn & Louis & Harry]
Kiss me where I lay down
My hands pressed to your cheeks
A long way from the playground
I have loved you since we were eighteen
Long before we both thought the same thing
To be loved and to be in love

[Chorus: All & Harry]
And all I can do is say that these arms were made for holding you
And I wanna love like you made me feel
When we were eighteen
I wanna love like you made me feel
When we were eighteen
I wanna love like you made me feel
When we were eighteen[Verse 1: Niall]
Remember the day we were giving up
When you told me I didn't give you enough
And all of your friends were saying I'd be leaving you
She's lying in bed with my t-shirt on
Just thinking how I went about it wrong
This isn't the stain of a red wine, I'm bleeding love

[Pre-Chorus: Niall]
Please believe me, don't you see
The things you mean to me?
Oh I love you, I love you
I love, I love, I love Olivia

[Chorus: Harry]
I live for you, I long for you, Olivia
I've been idolizing the light in your eyes, Olivia
I live for you, I long for you, Olivia
Don't let me go, don't let me go

[Verse 2: Liam]
Say what you're feeling and say it now
'Cause I got the feeling you're walking out
And time is irrelevant when I've not been seeing ya
The consequences of falling out
Are something Im having nightmares about
And these are the reasons I'm crying out to be with ya

[Pre-Chorus: Liam]
Please believe me, don't you see
The things you mean to me?
Oh I love you, I love you
I love, I love, I love Olivia

[Chorus: Harry]
I live for you, I long for you, Olivia
I've been idolizing the light in your eyes, Olivia
I live for you, I long for you, Olivia
Don't let me go, don't let me go

[Bridge: Harry]
When you go and I'm alone
You live in my imagination
The summertime and butterflies
All belong to your creation
I love you, it's all I do, I love you

[Chorus: Louis]
I live for you, I long for you, Olivia
I've been idolizing the light in your eyes, Olivia
I live for you, I long for you, Olivia
Don't let me go, don't let me go, don't let me go[Verse 1: Harry]
Maybe it's the way she walked
Straight into my heart and stole it
Through the doors and past the guards
Just like she already owned it

[Pre-Chorus: Zayn]
I said, "Can you give it back to me?"
She said, "Never in your wildest dreams"

[Chorus: All]
And we danced all night to the best song ever
We knew every line now I can't remember
How it goes but I know that I won't forget her
'Cause we danced all night to the best song ever
I think it went oh, oh, oh
I think it went yeah, yeah, yeah
I think it goes

[Verse 2: Liam & Harry & Niall]
Said her name was Georgia Rose
And her daddy was a dentist
Said I had a dirty mouth (I got a dirty mouth)
But she kissed me like she meant it

[Pre-Chorus: Niall]
I said, "Can I take you home with me?"
She said, "Never in your wildest dreams"

[Chorus: All]
And we danced all night to the best song ever
We knew every line now I can't remember
How it goes but I know that I won't forget her
'Cause we danced all night to the best song ever
I think it went oh, oh, oh
I think it went yeah, yeah, yeah
I think it goes

[Bridge: Louis & Zayn & Harry]
You know, I know, you know I'll remember you
And I know, you know, I know you'll remember me
And you know, I know, you know I'll remember you
And I know, you know, I hope you'll remember how we danced, how we danced
1, 2 - 1, 2, 3

[Chorus: All & (Zayn) & Harry]
How we danced all night to the best song ever
(How we danced!)
We knew every line now I can't remember
(We knew every line)
How it goes but I know that I won't forget her
'Cause we danced all night to the best song ever
We danced, we danced
And it goes something like this
And we danced all night to the best song ever
We knew every line now I can't remember
How it goes but I know that I won't forget her
(I know that I won't forget her)
'Cause we danced all night to the best song ever
(Best song ever!)
I think it went oh, oh, oh
I think it went yeah, yeah, yeah
I think it goes

[Outro: Zayn]
Best song ever
It was the best song ever
It was the best song ever
It was the best song ever[Intro: Harry]
Won't you stay 'til the A.M.?
All my favourite conversations
Always made in the A.M
Yeah, yeah

[Verse 1: Niall]
Feels like this could be forever tonight
Break these clocks, forget about time
There could be a World War 3 going on outside
You and me were raised in the same part of town
Got these scars on the same ground
Remember how we used to kick around just wasting time?

[Chorus: Harry]
Won't you stay 'til the A.M.?
All my favourite conversations
Always made in the A.M
'Cause we don't know what we're saying
We're just swimming 'round in our glasses
And talking out of our asses
Like we're all gonna make it, yeah, yeah

[Verse 2: Liam]
Feels like this could be forever right now
Don't wanna sleep 'cause we're dreaming out loud
Trying to behave but you know that we never learn how
You and me were raised  in the same part of town
Got these scars on the same ground
Remember how we used to kick around just wasting time?

[Chorus: Louis]
Won't you stay 'til the A.M.?
All my favourite conversations
Always made in the A.M
'Cause we don't know what we're saying
We're just swimming 'round in our glasses
And talking out of our asses
Like we're all gonna make it, yeah, yeah

[Bridge: Harry]
You know I'm always coming back to this place
You know and I'll say
You know I'm always gonna look for your face
You know

[Chorus: Harry & Louis]
Won't you stay 'til the A.M.?
All my favourite conversations
Always made in the A.M
'Cause we don't know what we're saying
We're just swimming 'round in our glasses
And talking out of our asses
Like we're all gonna make it, yeah, yeah

[Outro: Louis & Harry]
Won't you stay 'til the A.M.?
You know I'm always coming back to this place
Won't you stay 'til the A.M.? Yeah, yeah
You know, and I'll say
Won't you stay 'til the A.M.?
You know I'm always gonna look for your face
Won't you stay 'til the A.M.? Yeah, yeah[Verse 1: Liam]
Through the wire, through the wire, through the wire
I'm watching her dance, dress is catching the light
In her eyes there's no lies, no lies
There's no question, she's not in a disguise

[Pre-Chorus: Louis]
With no way out and a long way down
Everybody needs someone around
But I can't hold you, too close now
Through the wire, through the wire

[Chorus: All]
What a feeling to be right here beside you now
Holding you in my arms
When the air ran out and we both started running wild
The sky fell down
But you've got stars, they're in your eyes
And I've got something missing tonight
What a feeling to be a king beside you, somehow
I wish I could be there now

[Verse 2: Liam]
Through the wire, through the wire, through the wire
I'm watching you like this, imagining you're mine
It's too late, it's too late, am I too late?
Tell me now, am I running out of time?

[Pre-Chorus: Niall & Harry]
With no way out and a long way down
Everybody needs someone around
But I can't hold you, too close now
Through the wire, through the wire

[Chorus: All]
What a feeling to be right here beside you now
Holding you in my arms
When the air ran out and we both started running wild
The sky fell down
But you've got stars, they're in your eyes
And I've got something missing tonight
What a feeling to be a king beside you, somehow
I wish I could be there now

[Bridge: Harry]
Whatever chains are holding you back
Holding you back, don't let 'em tie you down
Whatever change is holding you back
Holding you back, tell me you believe in that

[Chorus: All]
What a feeling to be right here beside you now
Holding you in my arms
When the air ran out and we both started running wild
The sky fell down
But you've got stars, they're in your eyes
And I've got something missing tonight
What a feeling to be a king beside you, somehow
I wish I could be there now, I wish I could be there now[Verse 1: Liam]
It's inevitable everything that's good comes to an end
It's impossible to know if after this we can still be friends, yeah
I know you're saying you don't wanna hurt me, well maybe you should show a little mercy
The way you look, I know you didn't come to apologise

[Chorus: All & Harry]
Hey, hey, hey
Oh, why you wearing that to walk out of my life?
Hey, hey, hey
Oh, even though it's over you should stay tonight
Hey, hey, hey
If tomorrow you won't be mine, won't you give it to me one last time?
Oh, baby, let me love you goodbye

[Verse 2: Niall]
Unforgettable together, held the whole world in our hands
Unexplainable, a love that only we could understand, yeah
I know there's nothing I can do to change it, but is there something that can be negotiated?
My heart's already breaking, baby, go on twist the knife

[Chorus: All & Harry]
Hey, hey, hey
Oh, why you wearing that to walk out of my life?
Hey, hey, hey
Oh, even though it's over you should stay tonight
Hey, hey, hey
If tomorrow you won't be mine, won't you give it to me one last time?
Oh, baby, let me love you goodbye, oh, baby, let me love you goodbye

[Bridge: Louis & Harry]
One more taste of your lips just to bring me back
To the places we've been and the nights we've had
Because if this is it then at least we could end it right
Oh, why you wearing that to walk out of my life?

[Chorus: All & Harry]
Hey, hey, hey
Oh, even though it's over you should stay tonight, yeah
Hey, hey, hey
If tomorrow you won't be mine, won't you give it to me one last time?
Oh, baby, let me love you goodbye
Oh, baby, let me love you goodbye
Oh, baby, let me love you goodbye[Verse 1: Niall]
I'm like a crow on a wire
You're the shining distraction that makes me fly home
I'm like a boat on the water
You're the raise on the waves that calm my mind, oh, every time

[Pre-Chorus: Harry]
But I know in my heart
You're not a constant star

[Chorus: Harry & All]
And yeah, I let you use me from the day that we first met
But I'm not done yet, falling for you
Fool's gold
And I knew then, you turned it on for everyone you met
But I don't regret falling for you
Fool's gold

[Verse 2: Liam]
I'm the first to admit that I'm reckless
I get lost in your beauty and I can't see, two feet in front of me

[Pre-Chorus: Louis]
And I know in my heart
You're just a moving part

[Chorus: All]
And yeah, I let you use me from the day that we first met
But I'm not done yet, falling for you
Fool's gold
And I knew then, you turned it on for everyone you met
But I don't regret falling for you
Fool's gold

[Bridge: Zayn]
Yeah, I know your love's not real
That's not the way it feels, that's not the way you feel

[Chorus: All]
And yes, I let you use me from the day that we first met
But I'm not done yet, falling for you
Fool's gold
And I knew then, you turned it on for everyone you met
But I don't regret falling for you
Fool's gold[Verse 1: Niall]
Saw your body language and I know how you're feeling
You look like the kind of girl who's tired of speaking
Standing with somebody
But he doesn't know what you like
You caught my attention, you were looking at me first
All that I can see is you waking up in my t-shirt
If you're not hooked to anything
Right now I can be your vice

[Chorus: Liam & All & Niall]
All you need to know is
You can call me when you're lonely
When you can't sleep, I'll be your temporary fix
You control me, even if it's just tonight
You can call me when you feel like
I'm your good time, I'll be your temporary fix
You can own me, and we'll call this what you like
Let me be your good night

[Verse 2: Harry]
The night is on your lips and I feel like I'm locked in
There's a million lights, I don't care if they're watching
Your body's saying everything
I don't have to read your mind
Feel you on my neck while I'm calling a taxi
Climbing over me while I climb in the backseat
Now we're taking off
Now we're taking it off tonight

[Chorus: Liam & All & Harry]
All you need to know is
You can call me when you're lonely
When you can't sleep, I'll be your temporary fix
You control me, even if it's just tonight
You can call me when you feel like
I'm your good time, I'll be your temporary fix
You can own me, and we'll call this what you like
Let me be your good night

[Bridge: Louis & Harry]
We can roll in the darkness
Let me touch you where your heart is
And if you're feeling the weakness
Well I told you baby that you can call me
I'll be your temporary fix, you can call me

[Chorus: All & Harry]
You can call me when you're lonely
When you can't sleep, I'll be your temporary fix
You control me, even if it's just tonight
You can call me when you feel like
I'm your good time, I'll be your temporary fix
You can own me, and we'll call this what you like
Let me be your good night[Verse 1: Niall & Harry]
Stained coffee cup
Just a fingerprint of lipstick's not enough
Sweet, where you lay
Still a trace of innocence on the pillow case

[Chorus: Louis]
Waking up, beside you I'm a loaded gun, I can't contain this anymore
I'm all yours, I've got no control, no control
Powerless, and I don't care it's obvious, I just can't get enough of you
The pedal's down, my eyes are closed, no control

[Verse 2: Liam & Harry]
Taste, on my tongue
I don't want to wash away the night before
In the heat, where you lay
I could stay right here and burn in it all day

[Chorus: Louis]
Waking up, beside you I'm a loaded gun, I can't contain this anymore
I'm all yours, I've got no control, no control
Powerless, and I don't care it's obvious, I just can't get enough of you
The pedal's down, my eyes are closed, no control

[Bridge: Zayn]
Lost my senses, I'm defenseless, her perfume's holding me ransom
Sweet and sour, heart devoured, lying here I count the hours

[Chorus: Louis]
Waking up, beside you I'm a loaded gun, I can't contain this anymore
I'm all yours, I've got no control, no control
Powerless, and I don't care it's obvious, I just can't get enough of you
The pedal's down, my eyes are closed, no control
No control
No control
Powerless, and I don't care it's obvious, I just can't get enough of you
The pedal's down, my eyes are closed, no control[Intro]

[Verse 1: Zayn]
She's been my queen since we were sixteen
We want the same things, we dream the same dreams, alright, alright
I got it all 'cause she is the one
Her mum calls me love, her dad calls me son, alright, alright

[Pre-Chorus: Niall]
I know, I know, I know for sure

[Chorus: All & Liam & Harry]
Everybody wanna steal my girl
Everybody wanna take her heart away
Couple billion in the whole wide world
Find another one 'cause she belongs to me
Everybody wanna steal my girl

Couple billion in the whole wide world
Find another one 'cause she belongs to me
Na na na na na na na
Oh yeah

[Verse 2: Liam & Liam and Louis]
Kisses like cream, her walk is so mean
And every jaw drops when she's in those jeans, alright, alright
I don't exist, if I don't have her
The sun doesn't shine, the world doesn't turn, alright, alright

[Pre-Chorus: Niall]
But I know, I know, I know for sure

[Chorus: All & Liam]
Everybody wanna steal my girl
Everybody wanna take her heart away

[Bridge: Harry]
She know, she knows
That I never let her down before
Oh, she know, she knows
That I'm never gonna let another take her love from me now

[Chorus: All & Harry & Zayn & Niall]
Everybody wanna steal my girl
Everybody wanna take her heart away
Everybody wanna take her love away
Couple billion in the whole wide world
Find another one 'cause she belongs to me
Well, find another one 'cause she belongs to me
Everybody wanna steal my girl

Oh yeah
Na na na na na na na
Alright
Na na na na na na na
She belongs to me[Verse 1: Harry]
I told her that I loved her, was not sure if she heard
The roof was pretty windy and she didn't say a word
Party dying downstairs, had nothing left to do
Just me, her and the moon

[Pre-Chorus: Niall]
I said you're on fire, babe
Then down came the lightning on me
Love can be frightening for sure

[Chorus: All & Harry]
All I know at the end of the day
Is you want what you want and you say what you say
And you follow your heart even though it'll break sometimes
All I know at the end of the day
Is you love who you love, there ain't no other way
If there's something I've learned from a million mistakes
You're the one that I want at the end of the day
At the end of the day
You're the one that I want at the end of the day

[Verse 2: Liam]
She said the night was over, I said it's forever
20 minutes later, wound up in the hospital
The priest thinks it's the devil, my mum thinks it's the flu
But, girl, it's only you

[Pre-Chorus: Louis]
I said you're on fire, babe
Then down came the lightning on me
Love can be frightening for sure

[Chorus: All & Harry]
All I know at the end of the day
Is you want what you want and you say what you say
And you follow your heart even though it'll break sometimes
All I know at the end of the day
Is you love who you love, there ain't no other way
If there's something I've learned from a million mistakes
You're the one that I want at the end of the day

[Bridge: Louis]
When the sun goes down I
Know that you and me and everything will be alright
And when the city's sleeping
You and I can stay awake and keep on dreaming
You and I can stay awake and keep on dreaming

[Chorus: All & Harry & Louis]
All I know at the end of the day
Is you want what you want and you say what you say
And you follow your heart even though it'll break sometimes
All I know at the end of the day
Is you love who you love, there ain't no other way
If there's something I've learned from a million mistakes
You're the one that I want at the end of the day
At the end of the day
You're the one that I want at the end of the day
You're the one that I want at the end of the day[Verse 1: Harry]
A week ago you said to me
"Do you believe I'll never be too far?"
If you're lost, just look for me
You'll find me in the region of the summer stars
The fact that we can sit right here and say goodbye
Means we've already won
A necessity for apologies between you and me
Baby, there is none

[Pre-Chorus: Niall]
We had some good times, didn't we?
We had some good tricks up our sleeve
Goodbyes are bittersweet
But it's not the end, I'll see your face again

[Chorus: Harry]
You will find me, yeah, you will find me
In places that we've never been
For reasons we don't understand
Walking in the wind, walking in the wind

[Verse 2: Louis]
Yesterday, I went out
To celebrate the birthday of a friend
But as we raised our glasses up to make a toast
I realised you were missing

[Pre-Chorus: Liam]
We had some good times, didn't we?
We wore our hearts out on our sleeve
Goodbyes are bittersweet
But it's not the end, I'll see your face again

[Chorus: Harry]
You will find me, yeah, you will find me
In places that we've never been
For reasons we don't understand
Walking in the wind, walking in the wind

[Bridge: Harry]
I know we'll be alright, child
Just close your eyes and see
I'll be by your side
Any time you're needing me, oh yeah

[Chorus: All]
You will find me, yeah, you will find me
In places that we've never been
For reasons we don't understand
Walking in the wind, walking in the wind
Walking in the wind[Verse 1: Liam & Niall & Both]
Said Id never leave her 'cause her hands fit like my t-shirt
Tongue tied over three words, cursed
Running over thoughts that make my feet hurt
Bodies intertwined with her lips
Now shes feeling so low since she went solo
Hole in the middle of my heart like a Polo
And its no joke to me
So can we do it all over again?

[Chorus: Louis, Harry and Zayn & All]
If youre pretending from the start like this with a tight grip
Then my kiss can mend your broken heart
I might miss everything you said to me
And I can lend you broken parts that might fit like this
And I will give you all my heart
So we can start it all over again

[Verse 2: Harry & Louis]
Again we take the same road
Two days in the same clothes
And I know just what shell say if I can make all this pain go
Can we stop this for a minute?
You know, I can tell that your heart isnt in it or with it
Tell me with your mind, body and spirit
I can make your tears fall down like the showers that are British
Whether were together or apart
We can both remove the masks and admit we regret it from the start

[Chorus: Louis, Harry and Zayn & All]
If youre pretending from the start like this with a tight grip
Then my kiss can mend your broken heart
I might miss everything you said to me
And I can lend you broken parts that might fit like this
And I will give you all my heart
So we can start it all over again

[Bridge: Zayn & Liam]
Youll never know how to make it on your own
And youll never show weakness for letting go
I guess it's still hard if the seed's sown
But do you really want to be alone?
If youre pretending from the start like this
With a tight grip, then my kiss
Can mend your broken heart
I might miss everything you said to me

[Chorus: All & Harry & Zayn]
And I can lend you broken parts
That might fit like this
And I will give you all my heart
(All my heart)
So we can start it all over again
If youre pretending from the start like this with a tight grip
(If you're pretending from the start, yeah)
Then my kiss can mend your broken heart
I might miss everything you said to me
And I can lend you broken parts that might fit like this
And I will give you all my heart
So we can start it all over again[Verse 1: Harry & Zayn]
Who's that shadow holding me hostage? I've been here for days
Who's this whisper telling me that I'm never gonna get away?
I know they'll be coming to find me soon
But I fear I'm getting used to being held by you

[Chorus: All]
Baby, look what you've done to me
Baby, look what you've done now
Baby, I'll never leave if you keep holding me this way
Baby, look what you've done to me
Baby, you got me tied down
Baby I'll never leave if you keep holding me this way

[Verse 2: Louis & Niall]
Who's this man that's holding your hand and talking 'bout your eyes?
Used to sing about being free but now he's changed his mind
I know they'll be coming to find me soon
But my Stockholm Syndrome is in your room
Yeah, I fell for you

[Chorus: All]
Baby, look what you've done to me
Baby, look what you've done now
Baby, I'll never leave if you keep holding me this way
Baby, look what you've done to me
Baby, you got me tied down
Baby, I'll never leave if you keep holding me this way

[Bridge: Liam & Harry]
All my life I've been on my own
I used the light to guide me home
But now together we're alone
And there's no other place I'd ever wanna go
(Look what you've done to me)
Baby, look what you've done

[Chorus: All]
Baby, look what you've done to me
Baby, look what you've done now
Baby, I'll never leave if you keep holding me this way
Baby, look what you've done to me
Baby, you got me tied down
Baby, I'll never leave if you keep holding me this way

[Outro: All]
Baby, look what you've done
Baby, look what you've done to me
Baby, look what you've done to me[Verse 1: Liam & Harry & All]
People say we shouldnt be together
Too young to know about forever
But I say they dont know
What they talk talk talking about
(Talk talk talking about)
'Cause this love is only getting stronger
So I dont wanna wait any longer
I just wanna tell the world that you're mine girl,
Oh

[Chorus: Zayn & All]
They dont know about the things we do
They dont know about the I love yous
But I bet you if they only knew
They would just be jealous of us
They dont know about the up all nights
They dont know I've waited all my life
Just to find a love that feels this right
Baby they dont know about, they dont know about us

[Verse 2: Niall & Harry]
Just one touch and I was a believer
Every kiss it gets a little sweeter
Its getting better
Keeps getting better all the time girl

[Chorus: Zayn & All]
They dont know about the things we do
They dont know about the I love yous
But I bet you if they only knew (They don't know)
They would just be jealous of us
They dont know about the up all nights
They dont know I've waited all my life
Just to find a love that feels this right
Baby they dont know about, they dont know about us

[Bridge: Louis & Niall & Zayn]
They dont know how special you are
They dont know what youve done to my heart
They can say anything they want
'Cause they dont know about us
They dont know what we do best
Thats between me and you, our little secret
But I wanna tell 'em
I wanna tell the world that you're mine girl

[Chorus: All & Zayn]
They dont know about the things we do
They dont know about the I love yous
(I love you)
But I bet you if they only knew
(If they only knew)
They would just be jealous of us
(They would just be jealous of us)
They dont know about the up all nights
They dont know I've waited all my life
Just to find a love that feels this right
(It feels so right)
Baby they dont know about, they dont know about us
(They don't know about us, they don't know about us)
They dont know about the things we do
They dont know about the I love yous
(They don't know about us)
But I bet you if they only knew
They would just be jealous of us
They dont know about the up all nights (Up all night)
They dont know I've waited all my life (All my life)
Just to find a love that feels this right
Baby they dont know about, they dont know about us
They dont know about us[Verse 1: Harry Styles & Liam Payne]
I wanna write you a song
One as beautiful as you are sweet
With just a hint of pain for the feeling that I get when you are gone
I wanna write you a song
I wanna lend you my coat
One that's as soft as your cheek
So when the world is cold you'll have a hiding place you can go
I wanna lend you my coat

[Chorus: Louis Tomlinson]
Everything I need I get from you
And giving back is all I wanna do

[Verse 2: Liam Payne]
I wanna build you a boat
One as strong as you are free
So any time you think that your heart is gonna sink, you know it won't
I wanna build you a boat

[Chorus: Louis Tomlinson & Harry Styles]
Everything I need I get from you
And giving back is all I wanna do
Everything I need I get from you
And giving back is all I wanna do

[Outro: Niall Horan]
I wanna write you a song
One to make your heart remember me
So any time I'm gone, you can listen to my voice and sing along
I wanna write you a song
I wanna write you a song[Verse 1: Liam]
Wanna pull an all nighter and get into something we'll never forget
Wanna stay up and party the weekend away and not know when to quit
Wanna drive in the night to the end of the earth and go over the edge
Wanna wake up with you and say, "Baby, let's do it all over again"

[Pre-Chorus: Niall]
Lips so good I forget my name
I swear I could give you everything

[Chorus: Harry & All & Liam]
I don't need my love, you can take it, you can take it, take it
I don't need my heart, you can break it, you can break it, break it

Never enough
It's never enough
Never enough
Come on, come on

Its never enough, its never, its never, its never

Hey angel, do you know the reasons why
We look up to the sky?
Hey angel, do you look at us and laugh
When we hold on to the past? Hey angel

[Chorus: Louis]
Oh, I wish I could be more like you
Do you wish you could be more like me?
Oh, I wish I could be more like you
Do you wish you could be more like me?

[Verse 2: Harry]
Hey angel, tell me do you ever try
To come to the other side?
Hey angel
Tell me, do you ever cry when we waste away our lives?

[Chorus: Niall]
Oh, I wish I could be more like you
Do you wish you could be more like me?
Oh, I wish I could be more like you
Oh, I wish I could be more, I could be more, I could be more

[Bridge: Liam & Harry]
Yeah, I see you at the bar, at the edge of my bed
Backseat of my car, in the back of my head
I come alive when I hear your voice
It's a beautiful sound, it's a beautiful noise
I see you at the bar, at the edge of my bed
Backseat of my car, in the back of my head
I come alive when I hear your voice
It's a beautiful sound, it's a beautiful noise
Hey angel
Hey angel
Do you look up to the sky?
Do you look up to the sky?

Oh, I wish I could be more like you
Do you wish you could be more like me?
Oh, I wish I could be more like you
Do you wish you could be more like me?
Hey angel

Straight off the plane to a new hotel
Just touched down, you could never tell
Big house party with a crowded kitchen
People talk shh but we don't listen

[Pre-Chorus: Louis]
Tell me that I'm wrong, but I do what I please
Way too many people in the Addison Lee
Now I'm at the age when I know what I need, oh whoa

[Chorus: All]
Midnight memories, oh, oh, oh
Baby, you and me
Stumbling in the street
Singing, singing, singing, singing
Midnight memories, oh, oh, oh
Anywhere we go
Never say no
Just do it, do it, do it, do it

[Verse 2: Liam & Niall]
5 foot something with the skinny jeans
Don't look back, baby, follow me
I don't know where I'm going but I'm finding my way
Same old shh but a different day

[Pre-Chorus: Louis]
Tell me that I'm wrong, but I do what I please
Way too many people in the Addison Lee
Now I'm at the age when I know what I need, oh whoa

[Chorus: All]
Midnight memories, oh, oh, oh
Baby, you and me
Stumbling in the street
Singing, singing, singing, singing
Midnight memories, oh, oh, oh
Anywhere we go
Never say no
Just do it, do it, do it

[Bridge: Niall & Harry]
You and me and all our friends
I don't care how much we spend
Baby, this is what the night is for
I know nothing's making sense
For tonight, let's just pretend
I don't wanna stop, so give me more

[Chorus: All]
Midnight memories, oh, oh, oh
Baby, you and me
Stumbling in the street
Singing, singing, singing, singing
Midnight memories, oh, oh, oh
Anywhere we go
Never say no
Just do it, do it, do it, do it[Verse 1: Liam & Harry]
I've tried playing it cool
But when I'm looking at you
I can't ever be brave
'Cause you make my heart race
Shot me out of the sky
You're my kryptonite
You keep making me weak
Yeah, frozen, and can't breathe

[Pre-Chorus: Zayn & Liam]
Something's gotta give now
'Cause I'm dying just to make you see
That I need you here with me now
'Cause you've got that one thing

[Chorus: All]
So get out, get out, get out of my head
And fall into my arms instead
I don't, I don't, don't know what it is
But I need that one thing
And you've got that one thing

[Verse 2: Niall &  Niall and Zayn]
Now I'm climbing the walls
But you don't notice at all
That I'm going out of my mind
All day and all night

[Pre-Chorus: Louis & Zayn]
Something's gotta give now
'Cause I'm dying just to know your name
And I need you here with me now
'Cause you've got that one thing

[Chorus: All & Harry]
So get out, get out, get out of my head
And fall into my arms instead
I don't, I don't, don't know what it is
But I need that one thing
So get out, get out, get out of my mind
And come on, come into my life
I don't, I don't, don't know what it is
But I need that one thing
And you've got that one thing
(Whoa, whoa, whoa)
You've got that one thing

[Bridge: Liam]
Get out, get out, get out of my head
And fall into my arms instead

[Chorus: All, Zayn & Harry]
So get out, get out, get out of my head (Get out, get out, get out of my head)
And fall into my arms instead (Instead)
I don't, I don't, don't know what it is
But I need that one thing (I need that one thing)
So get out, get out, get out of my mind (Out of my mind)
And come on, come into my life
I don't, I don't, don't know what it is
But I need that one thing
And you've got that one thing[Intro: Harry]
I hear them calling for you
I hear them calling for you

[Verse 1: Liam & Louis]
I feel the waves getting started
It's a rush inside I can't control
Your eyes keep pulling me in
And I know, I know, I know
Your friends all talk about me
They say I got no chance at all
But your fire is burning deep
In my soul, my soul, my soul

[Pre-Chorus: Niall]
I ain't up for debating
Ain't in it for the taking
You got the whole world shaking

[Chorus: Harry & All]
In the middle of the night when the wolves come out
Headed straight for your heart like a bullet in the dark
One by one, I try to take them down
We can run and hide, ain't going down without a fight
I hear them calling for you, I hear them calling
In the middle of the night when the wolves come out
Headed straight for your heart, they come straight for your heart
I hear them calling for you, I hear them calling for you

[Verse 2: Liam, Louis & Niall]
I keep on holding tight now
'Cause your body's telling me don't let go
We're gonna be starting up trouble
I know, I know, I know
Just bringing my demons out
More than ever now
Your beauty could start a war
As you walk in the door

[Pre-Chorus: Liam]
I ain't up for debating
Ain't in it for the taking
We got the whole world shaking

[Chorus: Harry & All]
In the middle of the night when the wolves come out
Headed straight for your heart like a bullet in the dark
One by one, I try to take them down
We can run and hide, ain't going down without a fight
I hear them calling for you, I hear them calling
In the middle of the night when the wolves come out
Headed straight for your heart, they come straight for your heart
I hear them calling for you, I hear them calling for you

[Bridge: Niall & Liam]
I wish it wasn't true
But the whole world's tryna get a piece of you
And my heart keeps fighting in this battle of fools
Gotta make it through, gotta make it through

[Chorus: Harry & All]
In the middle of the night when the wolves come out
Headed straight for your heart like a bullet in the dark
One by one, I try to take them down
We can run and hide, ain't going down without a fight
I hear them calling for you, I hear them calling
In the middle of the night when the wolves come out
Headed straight for your heart, they come straight for your heart
I hear them calling for you, I hear them calling for you[Verse 1: Zayn & Harry]
Oh, I just wanna take you anywhere that you like
We could go out any day, any night
Baby, I'll take you there, take you there
Baby, I'll take you there, yeah
Oh, tell me, tell me, tell me how to turn your love on
You can get, get anything that you want

Baby, just shout it out, yeah

[Pre-Chorus: Liam & Harry]
And if you, you want me to, let's make a move
Yeah, so tell me, girl, if every time we

If you don't wanna take it slow
And you just wanna take me home
Baby, say, yeah, yeah
And let me kiss you

[Verse 2: Zayn & Niall]
Oh baby, baby, don't you know you got what I need?
Looking so good from your head to your feet
Come on, come over here, over here
Come on, come over here, yeah
Oh, I just wanna show you off to all of my friends
Making them drool down their chinny-chin-chins
Baby, be mine tonight, mine tonight
Baby, be mine tonight, yeah

[Pre-Chorus: Liam & Zayn]
And if you, you want me to, let's make a move
Yeah, so tell me, girl, if every time we

Baby, say, yeah, yeah
If you don't wanna take it slow
And you just wanna take me home
Baby, say, yeah, yeah
And let me kiss you[Verse 1: Niall & All]
Counted all my mistakes and there's only one
Standing out from the list of the things I've done
All the rest of my crimes don't come close
To the look on your face when I let you go
So I built you a house from a broken home
And I wrote you a song with the words you spoke
It took me some time but I figured out
How to fix up a heart that I let down

[Chorus: Zayn]
Now I'm searching every lonely place
Every corner calling out your name
Tryna find you but I just don't know
Where do broken hearts go? Where do broken hearts go?

[Verse 2: Liam & Harry & All]
Yeah, the taste of your lips on the tip of my tongue
Is at the top of the list of the things I want
Mind is running in circles of you and me
Anyone in between is the enemy
Shadows come with the pain that you're running from
Love was something you never heard enough
Yeah, it took me some time but I figured out
How to fix up a heart that I let down

[Chorus: Zayn & Harry & All]
Now I'm searching every lonely place
Every corner calling out your name
Tryna find you but I just don't know
Where do broken hearts go?
Are you sleeping baby by yourself
Or are you giving it to someone else?
Tryna find you but I just don't know
Where do broken hearts go? Where do broken hearts go?

[Bridge: Harry & All]
Tell me now, tell me now
Tell me where you go when you feel afraid
(Where do broken hearts go?)
Tell me now, tell me now
Tell me, will you ever love me again, love me again?

[Chorus: Zayn & All & Louis & (Harry)]
Now I'm searching every lonely place
Every corner calling out your name
Tryna find you but I just don't know
Where do broken hearts go?
Are you sleeping baby by yourself
Or are you giving it to someone else?
Tryna find you but I just don't know
Where do broken hearts go? Tell me where you're hiding out
Where do broken hearts go?
(Come on baby, 'cause I need you now)
Where do broken hearts go? Tell me 'cause I'm 10 feet down
Where do broken hearts go? Come on baby, come and get me out
Come on baby, come and get me out
(Come on baby, 'cause I need you now)
Where do broken hearts go? Where do broken hearts go? Where do broken hearts go? Where do broken hearts go?[Verse 1: Zayn & Liam]
My hands, your hands, tied up like two ships
Drifting, weightless, waves try to break it
I'd do anything to save it
Why is it so hard to say it?
My heart, your heart, sit tight like bookends
Pages between us written with no end
So many words we're not saying
Don't wanna wait 'til it's gone
You make me strong

[Chorus: All & Harry]
I'm sorry if I say, "I need you"
But I don't care, I'm not scared of love
'Cause when I'm not with you I'm weaker
Is that so wrong? Is it so wrong?
That you make me strong?

[Verse 2: Louis]
Think of how much love that's been wasted
People always trying to escape it
Move on to stop their heart breaking
But there's nothing I'm running from
You make me strong

[Chorus: All]
I'm sorry if I say, "I need you"
But I don't care, I'm not scared of love
'Cause when I'm not with you I'm weaker
Is that so wrong? Is it so wrong?

[Bridge: Zayn & Niall]
So, baby, hold on to my heart, yeah
Need you to keep me from falling apart
I'll always hold on
'Cause you make me strong
I'm sorry if I say, "I need you"
But I don't care, I'm not scared of love
'Cause when I'm not with you I'm weaker
Is that so wrong? Is it so wrong?

[Chorus: All & Harry]
I'm sorry if I say, "I need you"
But I don't care, I'm not scared of love
'Cause when I'm not with you I'm weaker
Is that so wrong? Is it so wrong?
That you make me strong?
I'm sorry if I say, "I need you"
But I don't care, I'm not scared of love
'Cause when I'm not with you I'm weaker
Is that so wrong? Is it so wrong
That you make me strong?[Verse 1: Liam]
So your friend's been telling me
You've been sleeping with my sweater
And that you can't stop missing me
Bet my friend's been telling you I'm not doing much better
Because I'm missing half of me

[Pre-Chorus: Zayn]
And being here without you
Is like I'm waking up to

[Chorus: Zayn]
Only half a blue sky
Kinda there but not quite
I'm walking around with just one shoe
I'm half a heart without you
I'm half a man at best
With half an arrow in my chest
I miss everything we do
I'm half a heart without you

[Verse 2: Louis & Zayn]
Forget all we said that night
No, it doesn't even matter
'Cause we both got split in two
If you could spare an hour or so
We'll go for lunch down by the river
We can really talk it through

[Pre-Chorus: Harry & Louis]
And being here without you
Is like I'm waking up to

[Chorus: Harry & Niall]
Only half a blue sky
Kinda there but not quite
I'm walking around with just one shoe
I'm half a heart without you
I'm half a man at best
With half an arrow in my chest
'Cause I miss everything we do
I'm half a heart without you
Half a heart without you
I'm half a heart without you

[Bridge: Niall]
Though I try to get you out of my head
The truth is, I got lost without you
And since then, I've been waking up to

[Chorus: Zayn & Harry]
Only half a blue sky (only half a blue sky)
Kinda there but not quite
I'm walking around with just one shoe
I'm half a heart without you
I'm half a man at best (half a man at best)
With half an arrow in my chest
I miss everything we do
I'm half a heart without you
Without you, without you, half a heart without you
Without you, without you
I'm half a heart without you[Intro]

[Verse 1: Liam & Zayn]
Hey girl, I'm waiting on you, I'm waiting on you
Come on and let me sneak you out
And have a celebration, a celebration
The music up, the window's down
Yeah, we'll be doing what we do
Just pretending that we're cool and we know it too
Yeah, we'll keep doing what we do
Just pretending that we're cool, so tonight

[Chorus: All & Zayn & Harry]
Let's go crazy, crazy, crazy 'til we see the sun

Don't let the pictures leave your phone, oh
Yeah, we'll be doing what we do
Just pretending that we're cool, so tonight

[Chorus: All & Harry]

We want to live while we're young

[Chorus: All & Zayn & Harry]
Let's go crazy, crazy, crazy 'til we see the sun ('Til we see the sun)

Tonight let's get some
And live while we're young[Verse 1: Niall]
We made a fire, went down in the flames
We sailed an ocean and drowned in the waves
Built a cathedral, but we never prayed
We had it all, yeah and we walked away

[Chorus: Harry]
Point of no return and now it's just too late to turn around
I try to forgive you but I struggle 'cause I don't know how
We built it up so high and now I'm falling
It's a long way down
It's a long way down from here

[Verse 2: Louis]
We had a mountain, but took it for granted
We had a spaceship, but we couldn't land it
We found an island, but we got stranded
We had it all yeah, who could've planned it?

[Chorus: Liam]
Point of no return and now it's just too late to turn around
I try to forgive you, but I'm struggling 'cause I don't know how
We built it up so high and now I'm falling
It's a long way down from here
Such a long way down from here
It's a long way down
It's a long way down
Such a long way down
It's a long way down
It's a long way down[Intro: Zayn]
Diana

[Verse 1: Liam & Harry]
The front pages are your pictures, they make you look so small
How could someone not miss you at all?
I never would mistreat you, oh I'm not a criminal
I speak a different language, but I still hear your call

[Chorus: Zayn]
Diana, let me be the one to
Light a fire inside those eyes
You've been lonely, you don't even know me
But I can feel you crying
Diana, let me be the one to
Lift your heart up and save your life
I don't think you even realize
Baby, you'd be saving mine
Diana

[Verse 2: Niall & Louis]
It's only been four months, but you've fallen down so far
How could someone mislead you at all?
I wanna reach out for ya, I wanna break these walls
I speak a different language, but I still hear you call

[Chorus: Zayn]
Diana, let me be the one to
Light a fire inside those eyes
You've been lonely, you don't even know me
But I can feel you crying
Diana, let me be the one to
Lift your heart up and save your life
I don't think you even realize
Baby, you'd be saving mine

[Bridge: Harry]
We all need something
This can't be over now
If I could hold you
I swear I'd never put you down

[Chorus: Zayn & Harry]
Diana, let me be the one to
Light a fire inside those eyes
You've been lonely, you don't even know me
But I can feel you crying
Diana, let me be the one to
Lift your heart up and save your life
I don't think you even realize
Baby, you'd be saving mine
Diana, Diana
Baby, you'd be saving mine
Diana, Diana
Baby, you'd be saving mine[Verse 1: Liam & Niall]
Make a little conversation, so long I've been waiting
To let go of myself and feel alive
So many nights I thought it over, told myself I kind of liked her
But there was something missing in her eyes

[Pre-Chorus: Harry]
I was stumbling
Looking in the dark (Ooh) with an empty heart
But you say you feel the same
Could we ever be enough? (Ooh) Baby, we could be enough

[Chorus: All & Louis]
And it's alright
Calling out for somebody to hold tonight
When you're lost, I'll find a way, I'll be your light
You'll never feel like you're alone
I'll make this feel like home

[Verse 2: Niall & Louis]
So hot that I couldn't take it, wanna wake up and see your face
And remember how good it was being here last night
Still high with a little feeling, I see the smile as it starts to creep in
It was there, I saw it in your eyes

[Pre-Chorus: Harry]
I was stumbling
Looking in the dark (Ooh) with an empty heart
But you say you feel the same
Could we ever be enough? (Ooh) Baby, we could be enough

[Chorus: All & Louis & Harry]
And it's alright
Calling out for somebody to hold tonight
When you're lost, I'll find a way, I'll be your light
You'll never feel like you're alone
I'll make this feel like home
I'll make this feel like home
Baby, we could be enough
And it's alright
Calling out for somebody to hold tonight
When you're lost, I'll find a way, I'll be your light
You'll never feel like you're alone
I'll make this feel like home[Intro]

[Verse 1: Harry]
Do you remember summer '09?
Wanna go back there every night
Just can't lie, was the best time of my life
Lying on the beach as the sun blew out
Playing this guitar by the fire too loud
Oh my, my, they could never shut us down

[Pre-Chorus: Louis and Liam]
I used to think that I was better alone
Why did I ever wanna let you go?
Under the moonlight as we stared at the sea
The words you whispered, I will always believe

[Chorus: Niall]
I want you to rock me, rock me, rock me, yeah
I want you to rock me, rock me, rock me, yeah
I want you to hit the pedal, heavy metal, show me you care
I want you to rock me, rock me, rock me, yeah

[Verse 2: Liam]
We were together, summer '09
Wanna roll back like pressing rewind
You were mine and we never said goodbye

[Pre-Chorus: Louis and Liam & Harry]
I used to think that I was better alone (Better alone)
Why did I ever wanna let you go? (Let you go)
Under the moonlight as we stared at the sea
(Stared at the sea)
The words you whispered I will always believe

[Chorus: Niall with Zayn]
I want you to rock me, rock me, rock me, yeah
I want you to rock me, rock me, rock me, yeah
I want you to hit the pedal, heavy metal, show me you care

La-da-da-da-da, la-da-da-da-da
Da-da-da

[Verse 1]
We are searchlights, we can see in the dark
We are rockets, pointed up at the stars
We are billions of beautiful hearts
And you sold us down the river too far

[Chorus]
What about us?
What about all the times you said you had the answers?
What about us?
What about all the broken happy ever afters?
What about us?
What about all the plans that ended in disaster?
What about love? What about trust?
What about us?

[Verse 2]
We are problems that want to be solved
We are children that need to be loved
We were willin', we came when you called
But man, you fooled us, enough is enough, oh

[Chorus]
What about us?
What about all the times you said you had the answers?
What about us?
What about all the broken happy ever afters?
Oh, what about us?
What about all the plans that ended in disaster?
Oh, what about love? What about trust?
What about us?
Oh, what about us?
What about all the plans that ended in disaster?
What about love? What about trust?
What about us?

[Bridge]
Sticks and stones, they may break these bones
But then I'll be ready, are you ready?
It's the start of us, waking up come on
Are you ready? I'll be ready
I don't want control, I want to let go
Are you ready? I'll be ready
'Cause now it's time to let them know
We are ready, what about us?

[Chorus]
What about us?
What about all the times you said you had the answers?
So what about us?
What about all the broken happy ever afters?
Oh, what about us?
What about all the plans that ended in disaster?
Oh, what about love? What about trust?
What about us?

[Outro]
What about us?
What about us?
What about us?
What about us?
What about us?
What about us?[Verse 1: P!nk]
Right from the start
You were a thief you stole my heart
And I your willing victim
I let you see the parts of me
That weren't all that pretty
And with every touch you fixed them
Now you've been talking in your sleep
Oh, oh
Things you never say to me
Oh, oh
Tell me that you've had enough
Of our love, our love

[Chorus: P!nk]
Just give me a reason
Just a little bit's enough
Just a second - we're not broken, just bent
And we can learn to love again
It's in the stars
It's been written in the scars on our hearts
We're not broken, just bent
And we can learn to love again

[Verse 2: Nate Ruess & P!nk & both]
I'm sorry I don't understand where all of this is coming from
I thought that we were fine
(Oh we had everything)
Your head is running wild again
My dear we still have everything
And it's all in your mind
(Yeah but this is happening)
Now you've been having real bad dreams
Oh, oh
You used to lie so close to me
Oh, oh
There's nothing more than empty sheets
Between our love, our love
Oh, our love, our love, love

[Chorus: Nate Ruess & both]
Just give me a reason
Just a little bits enough
Just a second - were not broken, just bent
And we can learn to love again
Ive never stopped
Youre still written in the scars on my heart
Youre not broken, just bent
And we can learn to love again

[Bridge: Nate Ruess & P!nk]
Oh, tears ducts and rust
I'll fix it for us
We're collecting dust but our love's enough
You're holding it in
You're pouring a drink
No nothing is as bad as it seems
We'll come clean

[Chorus: Both]
Just give me a reason
Just a little bit's enough
Just a second we're not broken just bent
And we can learn to love again
It's in the stars
It's been written in the scars on our hearts
That we're not broken just bent
And we can learn to love again

[Chorus: Both]
Just give me a reason
Just a little bit's enough
Just a second we're not broken just bent
And we can learn to love again
It's in the stars
It's still written in the scars on our hearts
That we're not broken just bent
And we can learn to love again

[Outro: P!nk]
Oh, we can learn to love again
Oh, we can learn to love again
Oh
That we're not broken just bent
And we can learn to love again[Verse 1]
We were on fire
I slashed your tires
It's like we burn so bright, we burn out
I made you chase me
I wasn't that friendly
My love, my drug, we're fucked up, oh

[Pre-Chorus 1]
'Cause I've been on the run so long they can't find me
You're waking up to remember I'm pretty
And when the chemicals leave my body
Yeah, they're gonna find me in a hotel lobby 'cause
Mmm, tough
Times they keep comin'
All night
Laughin' and fuckin'
Some days like I'm barely breathin'
After we were high and the love dope died it was you

[Chorus]
The pill I keep takin'
The nightmare I wake in
There's nothin', no nothin', nothin' but you
My perfect rock bottom
My beautiful trauma
My love, my love, my drug, oh

[Post-Chorus]
My love, my love, my love, my drug, oh
My love, my love, my love, my drug, oh
My love, my love, my love, my drug, oh
My love, (oh) my love, my drug, we're fucked up

[Verse 2]
You punched a hole in
The wall and I framed it
I wish I could feel things like you
Everyone's chasing
That holy feeling
And if we don't stay lit we'll blow out
Blow out

[Pre-Chorus 2]
'Cause we've been on the run so long they can't find us
Who's gonna have to die to remind us
That it feels like we chose this blindly
Now I'm gonna fuck up a hotel lobby
'Cause these tough
Times they keep comin'
Last night
I might have messed it up again
Some days like I'm barely breathin'
But after we were high and the love dope died it was you

[Chorus]
The pill I keep takin'
The nightmare I wake in
There's nothin', no nothin', nothin' but you
My perfect rock bottom
My beautiful trauma
My love, my love, my drug, oh

[Post-Chorus]
My love, my love, my love, my drug, oh
My love, my love, my love, my drug, oh
My love, my love, my love, my drug, oh
(My drug) my love, my love, my drug, we're fucked up

[Bridge]
Mmm tough
Times they keep comin'
All night
Laughin' and fuckin'
Some days like I'm barely breathin'
After we were high and the love dope died it was you

[Chorus]
The pill I keep takin'
The nightmare I wake in
There's nothin', no nothin', nothin' but you
My perfect rock bottom
My beautiful trauma
My love, my love, my drug, oh (drug)[Intro: P!nk]
Mhm, mhm, mhm, mhm, mhm, mhm, mhm

[Verse 1: P!nk]
Like Leo in The Revenant
Abel in that Bible bit
Revenge is sweet, isn't it?
Really, really hope for it
I know that it won't fix a thing
A song like this that I could sing for you
(Mhm mhm mhm mhm mhm mhm mhm)
All the feels you make me do
A nightmare fuckin' comin' true
I wish I was a lawyer, I would sue you
Sue you, take your dog, take your house
Take your shoes, take your heart
(Mhm mhm mhm mhm mhm mhm mhm)
And now here comes that singin' part

[Pre-Hook: P!nk]
I'm daydreamin', let me count the ways
How I'll get you or how I'll make you pay
(Mhm mhm mhm mhm mhm mhm mhm)
Babe, I'm hurtin' and now you'll feel the same
That's my plan, that's my plan, that's my plan, mhm
(Mhm mhm mhm mhm mhm mhm mhm)

[Hook: P!nk]
We could do revenge, revenge, revenge
Revenge together, together, together
We could take revenge, revenge, revenge
Revenge is sweet
(Mhm mhm mhm mhm mhm mhm mhm)
We could do revenge, revenge, revenge
Revenge together, together, together
We could take revenge, revenge, revenge
Revenge is sweet (now, now)

[Verse 2: P!nk]
Now here's where girlfriends come in hand
Especially those that understand
Crime's a crime, but listen, man
Really cannot give a damn
We've all been through this kind of thing
Say the word, we make it sting for him
(Mhm mhm mhm mhm mhm mhm mhm)
He can't just get away with it
Eye for eye, you piece of sh
You treat us like a garbage pit
Let me at him, wait for it, wait for it, wait for it
Here's that singin' part again
(Mhm mhm mhm mhm mhm mhm mhm)

[Pre-Hook: P!nk]
I'm daydreamin' (I'm daydreamin')
Let me count the ways (let me count the ways)
How I'll get you (how I'll get you)
Or how I'll make you pay (you pay)
(Mhm mhm mhm mhm mhm mhm mhm)
Babe, I'm hurtin' (I'm hurtin')
And now you'll feel the same (feel the same)
That's my plan, that's my plan, that's my plan
(Mhm mhm mhm mhm mhm mhm mhm)

[Hook: P!nk]
We could do revenge, revenge, revenge
Revenge together, together, together
We could take revenge, revenge, revenge
Revenge is sweet
(Mhm mhm mhm mhm mhm mhm mhm)
We could do revenge, revenge, revenge
Revenge together, together, together
We could take revenge, revenge, revenge
Revenge is sweet (revenge is sweet)

[Verse 3: Eminem]
Well, in the beginning we
Felt like we was meant to be
I fell for you and skinned my knee
But hell, with any injury, eventually you'll get up gingerly
Feels like it'll take a century to heal
But just know that I will
(Mhm, mhm, mhm, mhm, mhm, mhm, mhm)
But fuck tryna make amends, I'd rather take revenge
You're stickin' safety pins inside my atrium
Your day begins at 8 p.m.
You hit the ATM in my Mercedes Benz
With all your lady friendswhores!
Hit the club and you go out
Don't know a sum, 'cause when I calculate
The times you cheated and I total up all the amounts
It doesn't add up, 'cause you say that just givin' out your number doesn't count, get it? (I hate you)
And then see me with someone new, get mad and flip it, look how bad you spin it
First you turn your back on me, then tell me that I stabbed you in it?!
(Stabbed you in it, stabbed you in it
Stabbed you in it, stabbed you in it, SLUT!)
So when you're driving, driving to his house
And you pass me, while I'm drivin' to hers
Just remember, you cheated on me first (bitch!)
You're a whore, you're a whore, this is war
Fellas, ladies

[Hook: Eminem & P!nk]
We could do revenge, revenge, revenge
Revenge together, together, together (oh-ohh)
We could take revenge, revenge, revenge
Revenge is sweet (so sweet, oh-ohh)
(Mhm mhm mhm mhm mhm mhm mhm)
We could do revenge revenge, revenge
Revenge together, together, together
We could take revenge, revenge, revenge
Revenge is sweet

[Outro: Eminem & P!nk]
Fuck yeah!
Fuck no![Verse 1]
I know that I am runnin' out of time
I want it all, mmm, mmm
And I'm wishin' they'd stop tryin' to turn me off
I want it on, mmm, mmm
And I'm walkin' on a wire, tryin' to go higher
Feels like I'm surrounded by clowns and liars
Even when I give it all away
I want it all, mmm, mmm

[Pre-Chorus]
We came here to run it, run it, run it
We came here to run it, run it, run it

[Chorus]
Just like fire, burnin' up the way
If I could light the world up for just one day
Watch this madness, colorful charade
No one can be just like me any way
Just like magic,  I'll be flyin' free
I'mma disappear when they come for me
I kick that ceiling, what you gonna say?
No one can be just like me anyway
Just like fire, uh

[Verse 2]
And people like to laugh at you cause they are all the same, mmm, mmm
See I would rather we just go a different way than play the game
And no matter the weather, we can do it better
You and me together, forever and ever
We don't have to worry 'bout a thing, 'bout a thing

[Pre-Chorus]
We came here to run it, run it, run it
We came here to run it, run it, run it

[Chorus]
Just like fire, burnin' up the way
If I could light the world up for just one day
Watch this madness, colorful charade
No one can be just like me any way
Just like magic,  I'll be flyin' free
I'mma disappear when they come for me
I kick that ceiling, what you gonna say?
No one can be just like me anyway
Just like fire, fire, fire
Run it, run it, run it
We came here to run it, run it, run it

[Verse 3]
So look, I came here to run it
Just cause nobody's done it
Y'all don't think I can run it
But look, I been here, I done it
Impossible? Please
Watch, I do it with ease
You just gotta believe
Come uh, come uh with me
Oh, what's a girl to do?
(What, what?)
Hey, what's a girl to do?
(What, what?)
Oh, what's a girl to do?
(What, what?)
Mmmm, what's a girl to do?

[Bridge: Acoustic]
Just like fire, burnin' up the way
If I could light the world up for just one day
Watch this madness, colorful charade
No one can be just like me any way

[Chorus]
Just like fire, burnin' up the way
If I could light the world up for just one day
Watch this madness, colorful charade
No one can be just like me any way
Just like magic,  I'll be flyin' free
I'mma disappear when they come for me
I kick that ceiling, what you gonna say?
No one can be just like me anyway
Just like fire, fire

[Outro]
Run it, run it, run it
Just like fire
Run it, run it, run it[Intro]
Ever wonder about what he's doing
How it all turned to lies?
Sometimes I think that it's better to never ask why

[Chorus]
Where there is desire
There is gonna be a flame
Where there is a flame
Someone's bound to get burned
But just because it burns
Doesn't mean you're gonna die
You've gotta get up and try try try
Gotta get up and try try try
You gotta get up and try try try

[Break]
Eh, eh, eh

[Verse 1]
Funny how the heart can be deceiving
More than just a couple times
Why do we fall in love so easy
Even when it's not right

[Chorus]
Where there is desire
There is gonna be a flame
Where there is a flame
Someone's bound to get burned
But just because it burns
Doesn't mean you're gonna die
You've gotta get up and try try try
Gotta get up and try try try
You gotta get up and try try try

[Verse 2]
Ever worried that it might be ruined
And does it make you wanna cry?
When you're out there doing what you're doing
Are you just getting by?
Tell me are you just getting by by by

[Chorus]
Where there is desire
There is gonna be a flame
Where there is a flame
Someone's bound to get burned
But just because it burns
Doesn't mean you're gonna die
You've gotta get up and try try try
Gotta get up and try try try
You gotta get up and try try try
Gotta get up and try try try
Gotta get up and try try try
You gotta get up and try try try
Gotta get up and try try try

[Outro]
You gotta get up and try try try
Gotta get up and try try try[Intro]
Na na na na na na na, na na na na na na
Na na na na na na na, na na na na na na

[Verse 1]
I guess I just lost my husband, I don't know where he went
So I'm gonna drink my money, I'm not gonna pay his rent (Nope!)
I got a brand new attitude and I'm gonna wear it tonight
I wanna get in trouble, I wanna start a fight
Na na na na na na na, I wanna start a fight
Na na na na na na na, I wanna start a fight

[Chorus]
So, so what? I'm still a rockstar
I got my rock moves and I don't need you
And guess what? I'm havin' more fun
And now that we're done
I'm gonna show you tonight
I'm alright
I'm just fine and you're a tool
So, so what? I am a rockstar
I got my rock moves and I don't want you tonight

[Verse 2]
(Uh, check my flow, uh)
The waiter just took my table
And gave it to Jessica Simps (Shit!)
I guess I'll go sit with drum boy
At least he'll know how to hit (Oops!)
What if this song's on the radio?
Then somebody's gonna die
I'm gonna get in trouble
My ex will start a fight
Na na na na na na na, he's gonna start a fight (Huh!)
Na na na na na na na, we're all gonna get in a fight!

[Chorus]
So, so what? I'm still a rockstar
I got my rock moves and I don't need you
And guess what? I'm havin' more fun
And now that we're done
I'm gonna show you tonight
I'm alright (I'm alright)
I'm just fine and you're a tool
So, so what? I am a rockstar
I got my rock moves and I don't want you tonight

[Bridge]
You weren't there, you never were
You want it all, but that's not fair
I gave you life, I gave my all
You weren't there, you let me fall

[Chorus]
So, so what? I'm still a rockstar
I got my rock moves and I don't need you
And guess what? I'm havin' more fun
And now that we're done (We're done)
I'm gonna show you tonight
I'm alright (I'm alright)
I'm just fine (I'm just fine) and you're a tool
So, so what? I am a rockstar (Oh)
I got my rock moves and I don't want you tonight
(I don't want you tonight)

[Outro]
No, no, no, no
I don't want you tonight
You weren't there
I'm gonna show you tonight (I'm gonna show you tonight)
I'm alright (I'm alright)
I'm just fine and you're a tool
So, so what? I am a rockstar
I got my rock moves and I don't want you tonight
(I don't want you tonight!)

[Outro]
Woohoo!
Ba da da da da da[Verse 1]
There's somethin' in the way you roll your eyes
Takes me back to a better time
When I saw everything is good
But now you're the only thing that's good
Tryna stand up on my own two feet
This conversation ain't coming easily
And darlin', I know it's getting late
So what do you say we leave this place?

[Chorus]
Walk me home in the dead of night
I can't be alone with all that's on my mind, mhm
So say you'll stay with me tonight
'Cause there is so much wrong goin' on outside

[Verse 2]
There's somethin' in the way I wanna cry
That makes me think we'll make it out alive
So come on and show me how we're good
I think that we could do some good, mhm

[Chorus]
Walk me home in the dead of night
I can't be alone with all that's on my mind, mhm
So say you'll stay with me tonight
'Cause there is so much wrong goin' on outside

[Bridge]
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh

[Chorus]
Walk me home in the dead of night
'Cause I can't be alone with all that's on my mind
Say you'll stay with me tonight
'Cause there is so much wrong goin' on
Walk me home in the dead of night
I can't be alone with all that's on my mind
So say you'll stay with me tonight
'Cause there is so much wrong, there is so much wrong
There is so much wrong goin' on outside[Verse 1]
You took my hand, you showed me how
You promised me you'd be around
Uh-huh, that's right
I took your words and I believed
In everything you said to me
Yeah-huh, that's right

[Chorus]
If someone said three years from now
You'd be long gone
I'd stand up and punch them out
'Cause they're all wrong
I know better, 'cause you said forever
And ever, who knew?

[Verse 2]
Remember when we were such fools
And so convinced and just too cool
Oh no, no no
I wish I could touch you again
I wish I could still call you friend
I'd give anything

[Chorus]
When someone said count your blessings now
'Fore they're long gone
I guess I just didn't know how
I was all wrong
They knew better, still you said forever
And ever, who knew?

[Bridge]
Yeah, yeah
I'll keep you locked in my head
Until we meet again
Until we, until we meet again
And I won't forget you my friend
What happened?

[Chorus]
If someone said three years from now
You'd be long gone
I'd stand up and punch them out
'Cause they're all wrong and

[Outro]
That last kiss, I'll cherish, until we meet again
And time makes it harder, I wish I could remember
But I keep your memory, you visit me in my sleep
My darling, who knew?
My darling, my darling, who knew?
My darling, I miss you
My darling, who knew?
Who knew?[Verse 1]
Made a wrong turn, once or twice
Dug my way out, blood and fire
Bad decisions, that's alright
Welcome to my silly life
Mistreated, misplaced, misunderstood
Miss Knowing it's all good
It didn't slow me down
Mistaken, always second guessing
Underestimated
Look, I'm still around

[Chorus]
Pretty, pretty please
Don't you ever, ever feel
Like you're less than fuckin' perfect
Pretty, pretty please
If you ever, ever feel
Like you're nothing, you're fuckin' perfect to me

[Verse 2]
You're so mean
When you talk
About yourself, you were wrong
Change the voices in your head
Make them like you instead
So complicated, look happy, you'll make it
Filled with so much hatred, such a tired game
It's enough, I've done all I can think of
Chased down all my demons, I've seen you do the same, oh

[Chorus]
Pretty, pretty please
Don't you ever, ever feel
Like you're less than fuckin' perfect
Pretty, pretty please
If you ever, ever feel
Like you're nothing, you're fuckin' perfect to me

[Bridge]
The whole world's scared, so I swallow the fear
The only thing I should be drinking is an ice-cold beer
So cool in line, and we try, try, try
But we try too hard, it's a waste of my time
Done looking for the critics, 'cause they're everywhere
They don't like my jeans, they don't get my hair
Exchange ourselves and we do it all the time
Why do we do that?
Why do I do that?
(Why do I do that?)

[Chorus]
Yeah, oh, oh pretty, pretty please
Pretty, pretty please
Don't you ever, ever feel
Like you're less than fuckin' perfect
Pretty, pretty please
If you ever, ever feel
Like you're nothing, you're fuckin' perfect to me
Yeah, you're perfect, you're perfect, oh
Pretty, pretty please
If you ever, ever feel
Like you're nothing, you're fuckin' perfect to me[Verse 1]
White knuckles
And sweaty palms from hanging on too tight
Clenched shut jaw
I've got another headache again tonight
Eyes on fire, eyes on fire
And they burn from all the tears
I've been crying, I've been crying
I've been dying over you
Tie a knot in the rope
Tryna hold, tryna to hold
But there's nothing to grasp so
I let go

[Chorus]
I think I finally had enough
I think I maybe think too much
I think this might be it for us
Blow me one last kiss
You think I'm just too serious
I think you're full of shit
My head is spinning so
Blow me one last kiss
Just when it can't get worse
I've had a shit day
Have you had a shit day?
We've had a shit day
I think that life's too short for this
I want back my ignorance and bliss
I think I've had enough of this
Blow me one last kiss

[Verse 2]
I won't miss
All of the fighting that we always did
Take it in
I mean what I say when I say there is nothing left
No more sick
Whiskey dick
No more battles for me
You'll be calling a trick
Cause you no longer sleep
I'll dress nice
I'll look good
I'll go dancing alone
I will laugh
I'll get drunk
I'll take somebody home

[Chorus]
I think I finally had enough
I think I maybe think too much
I think this might be it for us
Blow me one last kiss
You think I'm just too serious
I think you're full of shit
My head is spinning so
Blow me one last kiss
Just when it can't get worse
I've had a shit day
Have you had a shit day?
We've had a shit day
I think that life's too short for this
I want back my ignorance and bliss
I think I've had enough of this
Blow me one last kiss

[Interlude]
Blow me one last kiss
Blow me one last kiss

[Bridge]
I will do what I please
Anything that I want
I will breathe
I will breathe
I won't worry at all
You will pay for your sins
You'll be sorry, my dear
All the lies, all the "why's" will be crystal clear

[Chorus]
I think I finally had enough
I think I maybe think too much
I think this might be it for us
Blow me one last kiss
You think I'm just too serious
I think you're full of shit
My head is spinning so
Blow me one last kiss
Just when it can't get worse
I've had a shit day
Have you had a shit day?
We've had a shit day
I think that life's too short for this
I want back my ignorance and bliss
I think I've had enough of this
Blow me one last kiss

[Interlude]
Blow me one last kiss
Blow me one last kiss

[Chorus]
Just when it can't get worse
I've had a shit day
Have you had a shit day?
We've had a shit day
I think that life's too short for this
I want back my ignorance and bliss
I think I've had enough of this
Blow me one last kiss[Verse 1: P!nk]
Sometimes I hate every single stupid word you say
Sometimes I wanna slap you in your whole face
There's no one quite like you
You push all my buttons down
I know life would suck without you

[Pre-Chorus: P!nk]
At the same time, I wanna hug you
I wanna wrap my hands around your neck
You're an asshole but I love you
And you make me so mad I ask myself
Why I'm still here, or where could I go
You're the only love I've ever known
But I hate you, I really hate you
So much, I think it must be

[Chorus: P!nk]
True love, true love
It must be true love
Nothing else can break my heart like
True love, true love
It must be true love
No one else can break my heart like you

[Verse 2: P!nk]
Just once try to wrap your little brain around my feelings
Just once please try not to be so mean
Repeat after me now R-O-M-A-N-C-E-E-E
Come on, I'll say it slowly (romance)
You can do it babe!

[Pre-Chorus: P!nk]
At the same time, I wanna hug you
I wanna wrap my hands around your neck
You're an asshole but I love you
And you make me so mad I ask myself
Why I'm still here, or where could I go
You're the only love I've ever known
But I hate you, I really hate you
So much, I think it must be

[Chorus: P!nk]
True love, true love
It must be true love
Nothing else can break my heart like
True love, true love
It must be true love
No one else can break my heart like you

[Interlude: P!nk]
I think it must be love (I love you)
I think it must be love (I love you)

[Bridge: Lily Allen]
Why do you rub me up the wrong way?
Why do you say the things that you say?
Sometimes I wonder how we ever came to be
But without you I'm incomplete

[Chorus: P!nk]
I think it must be
True love, true love
It must be true love
Nothing else can break my heart like
True love, true love
It must be true love
No one else can break my heart like you (like you)
No one else can break my heart like you (like you)
No one else can break my heart like you[Verse 1: P!nk]
Boy, you make it sound so pretty even when it's not
Didn't choose, but it's the only one we've got
And sometimes, I get so tired of getting tied up in my thoughts
You're the only one that ever makes it stop

[Chorus: P!nk]
God, it hurts to be human
Without you, I'd be losing
And someday, we'll face the music
God, it hurts to be human

[Post-Chorus: P!nk]
But I've got you, you, you, you, you, hey
And you've got me, me, me, me, too

[Verse 2: Khalid]
Like we're buckled and preparing for the crash
Like we're walking down a road of broken glass
Now if we defeat all odds and it was us against the world
You can count on me, you know I'd have your back

[Chorus: P!nk & Khalid]
God, it hurts to be human
Without you, I'd be losing
And someday, we'll face the music
God, it hurts to be human

[Post-Chorus: P!nk & Khalid]
But I've got you, you, you, you, you, hey
And you've got me, me, me, me, too
But I've got you, you, you, you, you, hey
And you've got me, me, me, me, too

[Bridge: P!nk, Khalid & Both]
Hope floats away
If you could spend a day in my shoes
Your mind would change
If you knew what I've gone through
We want the same (Yeah, we do)
Maybe then you'd understand
How it hurts to be human, oh

[Chorus: P!nk & Khalid, Khalid]
God, it hurts to be human
Without you (Without you)
I'd be losing (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
And someday, we'll face the music (Yeah)
God, it hurts (Yeah) to be human

[Post-Chorus: P!nk & Khalid]
But I've got you, you, you, you, you, hey
And you've got me, me, me, me, too
But I've got you, you, you, you, you, hey
And you've got me, me, me, me, too

[Outro: P!nk & Khalid]
Oh God, it hurts to be human[Verse 1]
I close my eyes and I can see
A world that's waiting up for me that I call my own
Through the dark, through the door
Through where no ones been before
But it feels like home

[Pre-Chorus]
They can say, they can say it all sounds crazy
They can say, they can say I've lost my mind
I don't care, I dont care, if they call me crazy
We can live in a world that we design

[Chorus]
'Cause every night, I lie in bed
The brightest colors fill my head
A million dreams are keeping me awake
I think of what the world could be
A vision of the one I see
A million dreams is all it's gonna take
Oh, a million dreams for the world we're gonna make

[Verse 2]
There's a house we can build
Every room inside is filled with things from far away
Special things I compile
Each one there to make you smile on a rainy day

[Pre-Chorus]
They can say, they can say it all sounds crazy
They can say, they can say we've lost our minds
See, I don't care, I don't care if they call us crazy
Run away to a world that we design

[Chorus]
'Cause every night, I lie in bed
The brightest colors fill my head
A million dreams are keeping me awake
I think of what the world could be
A vision of the one I see
A million dreams is all its gonna take
Oh, a million dreams for the world were gonna make

[Bridge]
However big, however small
Let me be part of it all
Share your dreams with me
We may be right, we may be wrong
But I wanna bring you along to the world I see
To the world we close our eyes to see
We close our eyes to see

[Chorus]
Every night, I lie in bed
The brightest colors fill my head
A million dreams are keeping me awake
I think of what the world could be
A vision of the one I see
A million dreams is all it's gonna take
A million dreams for the world we're gonna make

[Outro]
For the world we're gonna make[Verse 1]
Dear Mr. President, come take a walk with me
(Come take a walk with me)
Let's pretend we're just two people and you're not better than me
I'd like to ask you some questions if we can speak honestly
What do you feel when you see all the homeless on the street?
Who do you pray for at night before you go to sleep?
What do you feel when you look in the mirror?
Are you proud?

[Chorus]
How do you sleep while the rest of us cry?
How do you dream when a mother has no chance to say goodbye?
How do you walk with your head held high?
Can you even look me in the eye
And tell me why?

[Verse 2]
Dear Mr. President, were you a lonely boy? (Were you a lonely boy?)
Are you a lonely boy? (Are you a lonely boy?)
How can you say, "No child is left behind"?
We're not dumb and we're not blind (We're not blind)
They're all sitting in your cells
While you pave the road to hell
What kind of father would take his own daughter's rights away?
And what kind of father might hate his own daughter if she were gay?
I can only imagine what the first lady has to say
You've come a long way from whiskey and cocaine

[Chorus]
How do you sleep while the rest of us cry?
How do you dream when a mother has no chance to say goodbye?
How do you walk with your head held high?
Can you even look me in the eye?

[Bridge]
Let me tell you 'bout hard work
Minimum wage with a baby on the way
Let me tell you 'bout hard work
Rebuilding your house after the bombs took them away
Let me tell you 'bout hard work
Building a bed out of a cardboard box
Let me tell you 'bout hard work
Hard work
Hard work
You don't know nothing 'bout hard work
Hard work
Hard work

[Outro]
How do you sleep at night?
How do you walk with your head held high?
Dear Mr. President
You'd never take a walk with me
Would you?[Verse 1]
I open up my heart
You can love me or not
There's no such thing as sin
Let it all come right in
I wanna make some mistakes, I wanna sleep in the mud
I wanna swim in the flood, I wanna fuck 'till I'm done
I like whiskey on ice, I like sun in my eyes
I wanna burn it all down, so let's start a fire
I wanna be lost, so lost that I'm found
Naked and laughing with my blood on the ground

[Chorus]
I am here, I am here
I've already seen the bottom, so there's nothing to fear
I know that I'll be ready when the devil is near
I am here, I am here
All of this wrong, but I'm still right here
I don't have the answers, but the question is clear

[Post-Chorus]
Let me ask you
Where does everybody go when they go?
Where does everybody go when they go?
Where does everybody go when they go?
Let me ask you
Where does everybody go when they go?
Where does everybody go when they go?
Where does everybody go when they go?
Let me ask you

[Verse 2]
May the light be upon me
May I feel in my bones that I am enough
I can make anywhere home
My fingers are clenched, my stomach's in knots
My heart it is racing, but afraid I am not
Afraid I am not

[Chorus]
I am here, I am here
I've already seen the bottom, so there's nothing to fear
I know that I'll be ready when the devil is near
Cause I am here, I am here
All of this wrong, but I'm still right here
I don't have the answers, but the question is clear

[Post-Chorus]
Let me ask you
Where does everybody go when they go?
Where does everybody go when they go?
Where does everybody go when they go?
Let me ask you
Where does everybody go when they go?
Where does everybody go when they go?
Where does everybody go when they go?
Let me ask you
Ohhh

[Bridge]
I can think of one thousand places
Much worse than this

[Chorus]
But I am here, I am here
I've already seen the bottom, so there's nothing to fear
I know that I'll be ready when the devil is near
Cause I am here, I am here
All of this wrong, but I'm still right here
I don't have the answers, but the question is clear

[Post-Chorus]
Let me ask you
Where does everybody go when they go?
Where does everybody go when they go?
Where does everybody go when they go?
Let me ask you
Where does everybody go when they go?
Where does everybody go when they go?
Where does everybody go when they go?
Oh, let me ask you
Oh, let me ask you
Ooh, ooh
So let me ask you[Verse 1]
I don't wanna be the girl who laughs the loudest
Or the girl who never wants to be alone
I don't wanna be that call at four o'clock in the morning
Cause I'm the only one you know in the world that won't be home

[Pre-Chorus]
Ah, the sun is blinding
I stayed up again
Oh, I am finding
That's not the way I want my story to end

[Chorus]
I'm safe
Up high
Nothing can touch me
But why do I feel this party's over?
No pain
Inside
You're my protection
But how do I feel this good sober?

[Verse 2]
I don't wanna be the girl that has to fill the silence
The quiet scares me cause it screams the truth
Please don't tell me that we had that conversation
I won't remember, save your breath, cause what's the use?

[Pre-Chorus]
Ah, the night is calling
And it whispers to me softly come and play
Ah, I am falling
And If I let myself go I'm the only one to blame

[Chorus]
I'm safe
Up high
Nothing can touch me
But why do I feel this party's over? (Oh)
No pain
Inside
You're like perfection
But how do I feel this good sober?

[Break]
Coming down, coming down, coming down
Spinning round, spinning round, spinning round
Looking for myself, sober
Coming down, coming down, coming down
Spinning round, spinning round, spinning round
Looking for myself, sober

[Bridge]
When it's good, then it's good, it's so good 'till it goes bad
'Till you're trying to find the you that you once had
I have heard myself cry, never again
Broken down in agony, just tryna find a friend
Oh, oh

[Chorus]
I'm safe
Up high
Nothing can touch me (Nothing can touch me)
But why do I feel this party's over? (Why do I feel this party's over?)
No pain (no)
Inside (no)
You're like perfection
But how do I feel this good sober? (How do I feel this good sober?)
I'm safe
(No pain)
Up high
Nothing can touch me
But why do I feel this party's over? (Oh)
No pain
Inside
You're like perfection
But how do I feel this good sober? (How do I feel this good sober?)[Intro]
Ok
(So)

[Verse 1]
Running like a dog
Fighting like I bitch too much
And you just can't stand it, baby
Even when I fall, you don't seem to give two shits
'Cause you're just too cool, baby
We could have it all
But neither one of us would budge
'Cause we can't be wrong, baby
Folding up your arms, closing up your heart

[Pre-Chorus 1]
I know, I know, I know, you think it's me
'Cause I want it all
No, I know, I know, I know, I know you see
That we gotta talk
You know, you know, you know, we must believe or fall apart

[Chorus]
I feel like our ship's going down tonight
But it's always darkest before the light
And that's enough for me to try
Whatever you want
Whatever you need
Whatever you do, ah-ah-ah
Even if I say that it's over now
Even if we want to move on somehow
And just like that we come alive
Whatever you want (ah)
Whatever you need (yeah)
Whatever you do, ah-ah-ah

[Verse 2]
Trying to get a breath
Thinkin' 'bout the time you said that I was your heart, baby
Trying to understand how a grown man goes on without a body part, baby
I could walk away
I could always cash my chips and I'd be ok, baby
I would be ok, and you might be ok

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Oh, I know, I know, I know you think it's me
But ya want it all
I know, I know, I know, I know you see
That we gotta talk
No, you know, you know, you must believe
You're enough for me

[Chorus]
I feel like our ship's going down tonight
But it's always darkest before the light
And that's enough for me to try
Whatever you want (yeah)
Whatever you need (ah)
Whatever you do, ah-ah-ah
Even if I say that it's over now
Even if we want to move on somehow
And just like that we come alive
Whatever you want (yeah)
Whatever you need (ah)
Whatever you do

[Bridge]
Whoever said that love was sweet
(Drank a little too much whiskey, baby)
Whoever said that life was easy
(Never lived anywhere near me)
I wouldn't change a thing
'Cause you're the one I wanna sink with

[Chorus]
I feel like our ship's going down tonight
But it's always darkest before the light
And that's enough
Even if I say that it's over now (it's over now)
Even if we want to (if we want to move on somehow)
Move on somehow
And just like that we come alive
Whatever you want
Whatever you need
Whatever you do, ah-ah-ah
Whatever you want (yeah)
Whatever you need (ah)
Whatever you do, oh-oh-oh
Whatever you want (yeah)
Whatever you need (oh)
Whatever you do, ah-ah-ah
Whatever you want
Whatever you need
Whatever you do, oh-oh-oh[Chorus]
I'm comin' up, so you better get this party started
I'm comin' up, so you better get this party started

[Verse 1]
Get the party started on a Saturday night
Everybody's waiting for me to arrive
Sending out the message to all of my friends
We'll be looking flashy in my Mercedes Benz
I got lots of style, check my gold diamond rings
I can go for miles if you know what I mean

[Chorus]
I'm comin' up, so you better get this party started
(I'm comin' up, I'm comin')
I'm comin' up, so you better get this party started

[Verse 2]
Pumping up the volume, breaking down to the beat
Cruising through the west side, we'll be checking the scene
Boulevard is freaking as I'm coming up fast
I'll be burning rubber, you'll be kissing my ass
Pull up to the bumper, get out of the car
License plate says, "Stunner: #1 Superstar"

[Chorus]
I'm comin' up, so you better get this party started
(I'm comin' up, so you better)
I'm comin' up, so you better get this party started
Get this party started

[Verse 3]
Making my connection as I enter the room
Everybody's chillin' as I set up the groove
Pumping up the volume with this brand new beat
Everybody's dancing and they're dancing for me
I'm your operator, you can call anytime
I'll be your connection to the party line

[Chorus]
I'm comin' up, so you better get this party started
(I'm comin' up, I'm comin')
I'm comin' up, so you better get this party started
(I'm comin' up, I'm comin')
I'm comin' up, so you better get this party started
(I'm comin' up, so you better)
I'm comin' up, so you better get this party started
Get this party started (Ooh)
Get this party started right now
Get this party started (Ooh)
Get this party started
Get this party started right now[Verse 1]
Right, right, turn off the lights
We're gonna lose our minds tonight
What's the dealio?
I love when it's all too much
5 A.M. turn the radio up
Where's the rock 'n roll?

[Pre-Chorus]
Party crasher, panty snatcher
Call me up if you're gangsta
Don't be fancy, just get dancy
Why so serious?

[Chorus]
So raise your glass if you are wrong
In all the right ways, all my underdogs
We will never be, never be anything but loud
And nitty, gritty, dirty, little freaks
Won't you come on and come on and
Raise your glass
Just come on and come on and
Raise your glass

[Verse 2]
Slam, slam, oh hot damn
What part of party don't you understand?
Wish you'd just freak out (Freak out already)
Can't stop, coming in hot
I should be locked up right on the spot
It's so on right now (It's so fuckin' on right now)

[Pre-Chorus]
Party crasher, panty snatcher
Call me up if you're gangsta
Don't be fancy, just get dancy
Why so serious?

[Chorus]
So raise your glass if you are wrong
In all the right ways, all my underdogs
We will never be, never be anything but loud
And nitty, gritty, dirty, little freaks
Won't you come on and come on and
Raise your glass
Just come on and come on and raise your glass
Won't you come on and come on and
Raise your glass
Just come on and come on and raise your glass

[Bridge]
Oh shit! My glass is empty
That sucks!
So if you're too school for cool (I mean)
And you're treated like a fool (Treated like a fool)
You can choose to let it go
We can always, we can always party on our own
So raise your (Ah, fuck)

[Chorus]
So raise your glass if you are wrong
In all the right ways, all my underdogs
We will never be, never be anything but loud
And nitty, gritty, dirty, little freaks
So raise your glass if you are wrong
In all the right ways, all my underdogs
We will never be, never be anything but loud
And nitty, gritty, dirty, little freaks
Won't you come on and come on and
Raise your glass
Just come on and come on and raise your glass
Won't you come on and come on and
Raise your glass for me
Just come on and come on and raise your glass
For me[Intro: P!nk]
No-no-no, no-no-no, no
Hey
No-no-no, no-no-no, no

[Verse 1: P!nk]
We're driving in a black car
And it's blacked out and we're spinnin'
We're listening to "Fast Car"
And you're driving fast and you're singin'
Don't wanna tell you what I'm feelin'
Don't want this night to hit a ceiling
I'm wearing dirty white shoes
A white t-shirt and your jacket
I'm laughing, but I'm lying
When you're smiling, I'm the saddest
I hide my face so you don't see it
I think out loud, hope you don't hear it

[Pre-Chorus: P!nk & Wrabel]
It's going on 18 months now
And it's fucked up, but I'm falling
I feel it every day now
But I'm stallin', but I'm stallin'
I'm here, but I'm in pieces
And I don't know how to fix this
And I don't know how to fix this, no

[Chorus: P!nk & Wrabel]
If I'm just somebody that you're gonna leave
And you don't feel something when you look at me
You're holdin' my heart, mmm, whatcha say?
Just let me down slowly, I'll be okay
If you're just some habit that I gotta break
I can clear my system in 90 days
You're holdin' my heart, mmm, whatcha say?
Just let me down slowly

[Verse 2: Wrabel]
I get up, turn the lights out
And it's four o'clock in the morning
I close my eyes, I can't sleep
A hotel room in New York, and
I feel the space that's in between us
Convince myself that this is real love

[Pre-Chorus: Wrabel & P!nk, Wrabel]
'Cause you made this shit so easy
And I told you my secrets
So I don't know why I'm tongue tied
At the wrong time when I need this
I'm here, but I'm in pieces
And I don't know how to fix this
And I don't know how to fix this, no

[Chorus: P!nk & Wrabel]
If I'm just somebody that you're gonna leave
And you don't feel something when you look at me
You're holdin' my heart, mmm, whatcha say?
Just let me down slowly, I'll be okay
If you're just some habit that I gotta break
I can clear my system in 90 days
You're holdin' my heart, mmm, whatcha say?
Just let me down slowly

[Bridge: P!nk & Wrabel]
I-I-I, I-I-I, I-I-I
Ooh, no
We're drivin' in your fast car, your fast car
We're drivin' in your fast car, your fast car
We're drivin' in your fast car, your fast car
We're drivin' all night
We're drivin' in your fast car, your fast car, yeah
We're drivin' in your fast car, your fast car, yeah
We're drivin' in your fast car, your fast car, yeah
We're drivin' all night

[Chorus: P!nk & Wrabel, P!nk]
If I'm just somebody that you're gonna leave
And you don't feel something when you look at me
You're holdin' my heart, mmm, whatcha say?
(Oh, you're holdin' my heart)
Just let me down slowly, I'll be okay
If you're just some habit that I gotta break (Gotta break)
I can clear my system in 90 days
You're holdin' my heart, mmm, whatcha say?
(Oh, you're holdin' my heart)
Just let me down slowly[Verse 1]
Remember that time we were just kickin'?
But nothing had changed, nothing was really different
Then love showed its teeth like it's something vicious
No, no, no, let me finish
Ain't it something when it all goes tragic
How a spell can get casted onto something magic
What I wouldn't give to get back to where we had it
Oh, it should've lasted

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Now it's like I lied
When I said I didn't need you
Alright, if you'd left, I'd never be
Tonight can we just get it right
Somehow, for now

[Chorus]
Freeze frame, pause, rewind, stop
And get back to the older familiar thoughts
Can we just freeze frame, pause, rewind, stop
And get back to the feelings we think we lost?
For now

[Verse 2]
Oh, I'm so goddamn mean
'Cause I, I, I say and I do things
That I shouldn't sometimes
My mouth gets me in trouble all the time

[Pre-Chorus 2]
But now it's like I lied
When I said I didn't need you
I'd die, if you'd left, I'd never be
Alright, can we just get it right somehow
For now

[Chorus]
Freeze frame, pause, rewind, stop
And get back to the older familiar thoughts
Can we just freeze frame, pause, rewind, stop
And get back to the feelings we think we lost?
For now
For now
Can we just freeze frame, pause, rewind, stop
And get back to the feelings we think we lost?
For now

[Bridge]
Remember that time we were just kickin'?
But nothing had changed, nothing was really different
Then love showed its teeth like it's something vicious
No, no, no, let me finish
For now

[Chorus]
Freeze frame, pause, rewind, stop
And get back to the older familiar thoughts
Can we just freeze frame, pause, rewind, stop
And get back to the feelings we think we lost? (we lost)
For now
For now
Can we just freeze frame, pause, rewind, stop
And get back to the feelings we think we lost?
For now
For now
Can we just rewind, stop
Get back to the feelings we think we lost?
For now[Verse 1]
I remember conversations
We were dancing up on tables
Taking pictures when we had nowhere to post
You were laughin', I was cryin'
We were dancin', we were dyin'
Sometimes I don't know how we walked away

[Pre-Chorus 1]
If I'm honest what I liked
Were the things we didn't know
Every morning, every night
I'd be beating down your door
Just to tell you what I'm thinking
But you already know
Screw this, I don't wanna let it go

[Chorus]
So can we pretend that I'm 22 today?
Dancin' on the tables with you, oh yeah
Can we pretend that we all end up okay?
I just wanna forget with you, oh yeah
Can we pretend that we both like the president?
Can we pretend that I really like your shoes? Hell yeah
Can we pretend? 'Cause honestly, reality, it bores me
Let's pretend, oh, let's make believe
Can we, can we pretend?

[Post-Chorus]
Can we pretend?

[Verse 2]
I remember what we wanted
What we'd never take for granted
How our daddy issues took us to LA

[Pre-Chorus 2]
If I'm honest, what I miss
Is not knowin' what to say
And the feeling of your lips
And it haunts me every day
When you'd tell me what you're thinking
But I'd already know
Screw this, I don't wanna let it go
Oh yeah

[Chorus]
So can we pretend that I'm 22 today?
Dancin' on the tables with you, oh yeah
Can we pretend that we all end up okay?
I just wanna forget with you, oh yeah
Can we pretend that we both like the way it is? Hell yeah
Can we pretend that we like these fake-ass dudes? Oh yeah
Can we pretend? 'Cause honestly, reality, it bores me
Let's pretend, oh, let's make believe
Can we, can we pretend?

[Post-Chorus]
Can we pretend?

[Pre-Chorus 1]
If I'm honest, what I liked
Were the things we didn't know
Every morning, every night
I'd be beating down your door
Just to tell you what I'm thinking
But you'd already know
Screw this, I don't wanna let it go

[Chorus]
Can we pretend that we both like the president?
Can we pretend that you like my fake-ass shoes? Oh yeah
Can we pretend? Cause honestly reality, it bores me
Let's pretend, oh, let's make believe
Can we, can we pretend?

[Post-Chorus]
Can we pretend?
Oh, can we pretend?
Can we? Let's make believe
Can we (Can we)

[Outro]
Can we pretend? 'Cause honestly, reality, it bores me
Let's pretend, oh, let's make believe
Can we, can we pretend?
Honestly[Verse 1]
They say everything is temporary
Who the hell are they anyways?
I wanna know where does love go to die
Is it some sad empty castle in the sky?
Did we just shoot too high and spoil like wine?

[Chorus 1]
You walked by and it's like our bodies never touch
No love, you hold me close, but I don't feel much
I cry, maybe time isn't on our side
We had a thing, but we lost it
One more go, I kinda thought if we took it slow
It might be easier for us, yeah, for us to know
I know we never been quite here before
I wish I knew it when we lost it

[Verse 2]
You used to try to wake the beast in me
There's still a very sleepy part of me inside
I've been waiting to come alive
You stared into my eyes and turned to stone
And now I'm living all alone in these four walls

[Chorus 2]
There's a stranger, he's lying in my bed
Kinda blank like the thoughts living in my head
This is the one that I felt I knew so well
I think we had it, but we lost it
Still the girl that you chased all around the world
I haven't changed, just replaced all the chains with pearls
I want the same things we did back then
I know we had it, but we lost it

[Bridge]
Oh, the bone breaks
It grows back stronger
Oh, the bone breaks
It grows back stronger
The bone breaks
It grows back stronger
Oh, the bone breaks

[Chorus 3]
You walked by, and it's like our bodies never touch
No love, you hold me close, but I don't feel much
I cry, maybe time isn't on our side
We had a thing, but we lost it
One more go, I kinda thought if we took it slow
It might be easier for us, yeah for us to know
I know we never been quite here before
I wish I knew it when we lost it
Yeah, I wish I knew it when we lost it[Verse 1]
I will have to die for this, I fear
There's rage and terror and there's sickness here
I fight because I have to
I fight for us to know the truth

[Chorus]
There's not enough rope to tie me down
There's not enough tape to shut this mouth
The stones you throw can make me bleed
But I won't stop until we're free
Wild hearts can't be broken
No, wild hearts can't be broken

[Verse 2]
This is my rally cry
I know it's hard, we have to try
This is a battle I must win
To want my share is not a sin

[Chorus]
There's not enough rope to tie me down
There's not enough tape to shut this mouth
The stones you throw can make me bleed
But I won't stop until we're free
'Cause wild hearts can't be broken
No, wild hearts can't be broken

[Bridge]
You beat me, betray me
You're losing, we're winning
My spirit above me
You cannot deny me
My freedom is burning
This broken world keeps turning
I'll never surrender
There's nothing, but a victory

[Chorus]
There's not enough rope to tie me down, oh
There's not enough tape to shut this mouth
The stones you throw can make me bleed
But I won't stop until we're free
Wild hearts can't be broken
Wild hearts can't be broken
This wild heart can't be broken[Verse 1]
What do we conceal?
What do we reveal?
Make that decision every day
What is wrong with me
It's what's wrong with you
There's just so much I wanna say

[Pre-Chorus]
I like to make-believe with you
Da, da, da, da, do, do, do
That we always speak the truth ...ish
I like how we pretend the same
Da, da, da, da, do, do, do
Play this silly little game
(Hey)

[Chorus]
I've got some things to say
'Cause there's a lot that you don't know
It's written on my face
It's gonna be hard to swallow
(Everybody's got a secret)
I got some things to say
(Everybody's got a secret)
'Cause there's a lot that you don't know
(Everybody's got a secret)
It's written on my face
(Everybody's got a secret)

[Verse 2]
I let the walls come down
I let the monster out
And it's coming after me (after me)
Do you feel exposed
Where it hurts the most?
Can you wear it on your sleeve?

[Pre-Chorus]
I like to make-believe with you
Da, da, da, da, do, do, do
That we always speak the truth (always speak the truth) ...ish
I like how we pretend the same
Da, da, da, da, do, do, do
Play this silly little game
(Hey)

[Chorus]
I've got some things to say
'Cause there's a lot that you don't know (know, know)
It's written on my face
It's gonna be hard to swallow
(Everybody's got a secret)
I got some things to say
(Everybody's got a secret)
'Cause there's a lot that you don't know
(Everybody's got a secret)
It's written on my face
(Everybody's got a secret)

[Bridge]
Put it in the closet
Lock the doors
I'm wondering which one is worse
Is it mine or is it yours? (yours)
Put it in the closet
Lock the doors
Wondering which one is worse
I'll show mine if you show yours (yours)
I'll show mine if you show yours, oh
He-he-hey

[Chorus]
(Everybody's got a secret)
I got some things to say
(Everybody's got a secret)
'Cause there's a lot that you don't know
(Everybody's got a secret)
It's written on my face
(Everybody's got a secret)
It's gonna be hard to swallow

[Outro]
Da, da, da, da, do, do, do
Da, da, da, da, do, do, do
Da, da, da, da, do, do, do
(Everybody's got a secret)
Da, da, da, da, do, do, do
Da, da, da, da, do, do, do
Da, da, da, da, do, do, do
(Everybody's got a secret)[Verse 1]
Check it out, goin' out on the late night
Lookin' tight, feelin' nice, it's a cock fight
I can tell, I just know, that it's going down
Tonight

[Pre-Chorus 1]
At the door we don't wait 'cause we know them
At the bar six shots just beginnin'
That's when dickhead put his hands on me
But you see

[Chorus]
I'm not here for your entertainment
You don't really wanna mess with me tonight
Just stop and take a second
I was fine before you walked into my life
'Cause you know it's over
Before it began
Keep your drink, just give me the money
It's just you and your hand tonight

[Verse 2]
Midnight, I'm drunk, I don't give a fuck
Wanna dance, by myself, guess you're outta luck
Don't touch, back up, I'm not the one
Buh-bye

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Listen up; it's just not happening
You can say what you want to your boyfriends
Just let me have my fun tonight
Aight

[Chorus]
I'm not here for your entertainment
You don't really wanna mess with me tonight
Just stop and take a second
I was fine before you walked into my life
'Cause you know it's over
Before it began
Keep your drink, just give me the money
It's just you and your hand tonight

[Bridge]
Break-break-break-break-break it down
You're in the corner with your boys you bet them five bucks
You'd get the girl that just walked in, but she thinks you suck
We didn't get all dressed up just for you to see
So quit spilling your drinks on me, yeah

[Interlude]
You know who you are
High fivin', talking shit, but you're goin' home alone aren't ya?

[Chorus]
'Cause I'm not here for your entertainment (No)
You don't really wanna mess with me tonight
Just stop and take a second (Just stop and take a second)
I was fine before you walked into my life
'Cause you know it's over (Know it's over)
Before it began
Keep your drink, just give me the money
It's just you and your hand tonight (It's just you and your hand)
I'm not here for your entertainment (No, no, no)
You don't really wanna mess with me tonight
Just stop and take a second (Just take a second)
I was fine before you walked into my life
'Cause you know it's over
Before it began
Keep your drink, just give me the money
It's just you and your hand tonight (Yeah, ohh)[Verse 1]
Another day, another sin
Another day I'm late again
Oh, just like that my money's spent
Where did it all go?
Another night, another heart
Another one leaves in the dark
And I'm searching for my counterpart
Where did they all go?

[Pre-Chorus 1]
And I lock every single door
And I look behind me even more
Now turned into someone that I swore
I would never be

[Chorus]
I wish I could go back to playing barbies in my room
They never say that you gotta grow up, quite this soon
How fast things change
And now I'm here, and all I wanna do
Is go back to playing barbies in my room

[Verse 2]
And I see it on my father's face
Another line that comes with age
I know that time will have its way
Where did it all go?
They say that things were simple then
Although I don't remember when
I wanna know what happens next
Where do we all go?

[Pre-Chorus 2]
And I lock every single door
And I look behind me even more
And now turned into someone that I swore
I would never be

[Chorus]
Oh, I wish I could go back to playing barbies in my room
They never say that you gotta grow up, quite this soon
How fast things change
And now I'm here, and all I wanna do
Is go back to playing barbies in my room

[Bridge]
Pink canopies and grass-stained knees
Putting fireflies in a jar
Getting home before it's dark
Scotch-taping posters on my wall
Rolling pixie sticks to smoke
Couldn't wait 'till I was older

[Chorus]
And I wish I could go back to playing barbies in my room
They never say that you gotta grow up, quite this soon
How fast things change
But now I'm here, and all I wanna do
Is go back to playing barbies in my room
Back to playing barbies in my
Oh, I wish that I could go back
I wish that I could go back
I wish that I could go back
Back to playing barbies in my room[Verse 1]
I'm lying here on the floor where you left me
I think I took too much
I'm crying here, what have you done?
I thought it would be fun

[Pre-Chorus]
I can't stay on your life support
There's a shortage in the switch
I can't stay on your morphine
Cause it's making me itch
I said I tried to call the nurse again
But she's being a little bitch
I think I'll get outta here, where I can

[Chorus]
Run just as fast as I can
To the middle of nowhere
To the middle of my frustrated fears
And I swear, you're just like a pill
Instead of making me better
You keep making me ill
You keep making me ill

[Verse 2]
I haven't moved from the spot where you left me
This must be a bad trip
All of the other pills
They were different
Maybe I should get some help

[Pre-Chorus]
I can't stay on your life support
There's a shortage in the switch
I can't stay on your morphine
Cause it's making me itch
I said I tried to call the nurse again
But she's being a little bitch
I think I'll get outta here, where I can

[Chorus]
Run just as fast as I can
To the middle of nowhere
To the middle of my frustrated fears
And I swear, you're just like a pill
Instead of making me better
You keep making me ill
You keep making me ill
Run just as fast as I can
To the middle of nowhere
To the middle of my frustrated fears
And I swear, you're just like a pill
Instead of making me better
You keep making me ill
You keep making me ill

[Pre-Chorus]
I can't stay on your life support
There's a shortage in the switch
I can't stay on your morphine
Cause it's making me itch
I said I tried to call the nurse again
But she's being a little bitch
I think I'll get outta here, where I can

[Chorus]
Run just as fast as I can
To the middle of nowhere
To the middle of my frustrated fears
And I swear, you're just like a pill
Instead of making me better
You keep making me ill
You keep making me ill
Run just as fast as I can
To the middle of nowhere
To the middle of my frustrated fears
And I swear, you're just like a pill
Instead of making me better
You keep making me ill
You keep making me ill
Run just as fast as I can
To the middle of nowhere
To the middle of my frustrated fears
And I swear, you're just like a pill
Instead of making me better
You keep making me ill
You keep making me ill[Intro]
Uh, uh, some deep shit
Uh, uh
Look away
Uh, uh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse 1]
Momma please stop crying, I can't stand the sound
Your pain is painful and it's tearin' me down
I hear glasses breaking as I sit up in my bed
I told dad you didn't mean those nasty things you said

[Verse 2]
You fight about money, 'bout me and my brother
And this I come home to, this is my shelter
It ain't easy growing up in World War III
Never knowing what love could be, you'll see
I don't want love to destroy me like it has done my family

[Chorus]
Can we work it out? (Can we?) Can we be a family? (Can we?)
I promise I'll be better (I promise)
Mommy, I'll do anything (I'll do anything)
Can we work it out? Can we be a family?
I promise I'll be better
Daddy, please don't leave

[Verse 3]
Daddy please stop yellin' (Stop)
I can't stand the sound (Can't stand the sound)
Make momma stop cryin', 'cause I need you around
My mama, she loves you (I know it)
No matter what she says, it's true
I know that she hurts you, but remember, I love you, too

[Verse 4]
I ran away today
Ran from the noise, ran away (Ran away)
Don't wanna go back to that place
But don't have no choice, no way
It ain't easy growin' up in World War III
Never knowing what love could be, well, I've seen
I don't want love to destroy me like it did my family

[Chorus]
Can we work it out? (Can we work it out?) Can we be a family?
I promise I'll be better, Mommy, I'll do anything
(I promise I'll do anything to keep you there)
Can we work it out? Can we be a family?
I promise I'll be better (I promise, I promise)
Daddy, please don't leave

[Verse 5]
In our family portrait (In our family portrait)
We look pretty happy (We look pretty happy)
Let's play pretend, let's act like it comes naturally
(Let's play, let's play, let's play pretend)
I don't wanna have to split the holidays
I don't want two addresses
I don't want a step-brother anyways
And I don't want my mom to have to change her last name

[Chorus]
In our family portrait, we look pretty happy
We look pretty normal, let's go back to that
In our family portrait, we look pretty happy
Let's play pretend, act like it goes naturally

[Chorus]
In our family portrait, we look pretty happy
(Can we work it out? Can we be a family?)
We look pretty normal, let's go back to that
(I promise I'll be better, Mommy, I'll do anything)
In our family portrait. we look pretty happy
(Can we work it out? Can we be a family?)
Let's play pretend act and like it comes so naturally
(I promise I'll be better, Daddy, please don't leave)
In our family portrait we look pretty happy
(Can we work it out? Can we be a family?)
We look pretty normal, let's go back to that
(I promise I'll be better, Daddy, please don't leave)

[Bridge]
Daddy, don't leave
Daddy, don't leave
Daddy, don't leave
Turn around, please
Remember that the night you left, you took my shining star?
Daddy, don't leave
Daddy, don't leave
Daddy, don't leave
Don't leave us here alone

[Outro]
Mom will be nicer
I'll be so much better, I'll tell my brother
Oh, I won't spill the milk at dinner
I'll be so much better, I'll do everything right
I'll be your little girl forever
I'll go to sleep at night[Intro]
Uh-huh, uh-huh
Stupid girl, stupid girls, stupid girls

[Chorus]
Maybe if I act like that, that guy will call me back
Porno paparazzi girl, I don't wanna be a stupid girl

[Verse 1]
Go to Fred Segal, you'll find them there
Laughin' loud so all the little people stare
Lookin' for a daddy to pay for the champagne (Droppin' names)
What happened to the dream of a girl president?
She's dancing in the video next to 50 Cent
They travel in packs of two or three
With their itsy-bitsy doggies and their teeny-weeny tees

[Pre-Chorus]
Where, oh where, have the smart people gone?
Oh where, oh where could they be?

[Chorus]
Maybe if I act like that, that guy will call me back
Porno paparazzi girl, I don't wanna be a stupid girl
Baby, if I act like that, flippin' my blonde hair back
Push up my bra like that, I don't wanna be a stupid girl
(Break it down now)

[Verse 2]
The disease is growing, it's epidemic
I'm scared that there ain't a cure
The world believes it and I'm going crazy
I cannot take anymore!
I'm so glad that I'll never fit in
That will never be me
Outcasts and girls with ambition
That's what I wanna see (Come on)

[Pre-Chorus]
Disasters all around (Disasters all around)
A world of despair (A world of despair)
Your only concern: "Will it fuck up my hair?"

[Chorus]
Maybe if I act like that, that guy will call me back
Porno paparazzi girl, I don't wanna be a stupid girl
Baby, if I act like that, flippin' my blonde hair back
Push up my bra like that, I don't wanna be a stupid girl

[Bridge]
(Do ya think, and do ya think, do ya think?)
(I like this, like this, like this)
Pretty will you fuck me girl, silly I'm so lucky girl
Pull my hair, I'll suck it girl, stupid girl!
Pretty will you fuck me girl, silly I'm so lucky girl
Pull my hair, I'll suck it girl, stupid girl!
(Baby, if I) Baby, if I act like that, flippin' my blonde hair back
(Baby, if I) Push up my bra like that, stupid girl!

[Chorus]
Maybe if I act like that (Maybe if I act like that)
That guy will call me back (That guy will call me back)
Porno paparazzi girl (Porno paparazzi girl)
I don't wanna be a stupid girl (Stupid girls)
Baby, if I act like that (Baby, if I act like that)
Flippin' my blonde hair back (Flipping my blonde hair back)
Push up my bra like that (Push up my bra like that)
I don't wanna be a stupid girl (Stupid girls)

[Outro]
Baby, if I act like that (Stupid girls)
Flipping my blonde hair back (Stupid girls)
Push up my bra like that (Stupid girls)
Stupid girls
(Stupid girls) Stupid girl
(Stupid girls) Stupid girls
(Stupid girls) Stupid girl
(Stupid girls)
(Stupid girls)[Verse 1]
Have you ever fed a lover with just your hands?
Closed your eyes and trusted, just trusted?
Have you ever thrown a fistful of glitter in the air?
Have you ever looked fear in the face and said, "I just don't care"?

[Verse 2]
It's only half past the point of no return
The tip of the iceberg, the sun before the burn
The thunder before the lightning and the breath before the phrase
Have you ever felt this way?

[Verse 3]
Have you ever hated yourself for staring at the phone?
Your whole life waiting on the ring to prove you're not alone
Have you ever been touched so gently you had to cry?
Have you ever invited a stranger to come inside?

[Verse 4]
It's only half past the point of oblivion
The hourglass on the table, the walk before the run
The breath before the kiss, and the fear before the flames
Have you ever felt this way?
La la la la la la la la

[Bridge]
There you are
Sitting in the garden
Clutching my coffee
Calling me sugar
You called me sugar

[Verse 5]
Have you ever wished for an endless night?
Lassoed the moon and the stars and pulled that rope tight?
Have you ever held your breath and asked yourself
Will it ever get better than tonight?
Tonight[Verse 1]
I've been up late watching you breathe
Wondering if you're gonna leave
Don't tell me what you see
That you actually believe it
Fuck, I'm blue
And all those photos that you like of a better life, better wife, better nights, better high
Goddamn right I miss drinking
Yeah, I do

[Pre-Chorus 1]
But I've been up late nights
Staring at the street lights
All the cigarette smoke, can't escape a closing window
And my head's like "What happened to, it's alright?"
Baby, It's not alright
What if we're a closing window?

[Chorus]
But I can't shake the feeling
That you picture a better life, better wife, better nights, better high
I can't shake the feeling (I can't shake the feeling)
Do you picture a better life?

[Verse 2]
I found myself up late feeling kinda jealous
Looking at the bullshit, other people's wellness
And it's got me thinking
It's just not you (not you)
I've been all night looking in the eyes of my baby
Right in front of me, what a gift, so amazing
Oh, that's what's true

[Pre-Chorus 2]
But I stay up late night
Screaming at the street lights
All the cigarette smoke, filling up these hopeless lungs
Oh, and my head's like "What happened to, it's alright?"
(Whats happened?)
Baby, It's not alright
I feel like a closing window

[Chorus]
But I can't shake the feeling (No, I can't shake the feeling)
That you picture a better life, better wife, better nights, better high
I can't shake the feeling (I can't shake the feeling, my baby)
Do you picture a better life?

[Bridge]
I can't seem to understand it
How did we get so low?
No, no, no
I can't seem to understand it
How did we get so low? (How?)
No, no, no

[Chorus]
But I can't shake the feeling (I can't seem to understand it, how did we get so low?)
That you picture a better life, better wife, better nights, better high (no, no, no)
I can't shake the feeling (I can't seem to understand it, how did we get so low?)
Ooh, do you picture a better life?

[Outro]
Oooh
Do you picture a better life?
Ooh, do you picture a better life?
And I wonder, and I wonder
Do you picture a better life? (Mmm, can't shake the feeling)
And I wonder (I can't shake the feeling)
Do you picture
Do you picture a better life?[Verse 1]
Got a hole in my head and my heart tonight
Well you shot me down, you just ain't right
Comes a time when you know you must let go
I know, I know
We fixed it, but it's broken
Got a feeling we gonna get this wrong
And even I can't be this strong
It's a breath that you take right before you die
We lie and lie
Can't say we didn't try though

[Pre-Chorus]
So here we go
Take my body, not my soul
Took me high and left me low
I honestly never imagined we'd get this far, oh

[Chorus]
There's a road that takes me home
Take me fast or take me slow
Throw my head out the window
Feel the wind, make me whole
Write my name up in the sky
As we contemplate goodbye
I don't know, we don't know, where we go

[Verse 2]
There's not a holy man or prayer in sight
There's not a priest around to read our rights
There's no magic balm to save our lives
I know, I know
We've both always been broken
But you had a way of making me forget
All the sadness rollin' 'round my head
Well, that was until I wished us dead
You had my heart
I wish you would have kept it

[Pre-Chorus]
This world we know
It takes our bodies, not our souls
It takes us high and leaves us low
But they honestly never imagined we'd get this far

[Chorus]
There's a road that takes me home
Take me fast or take me slow
Throw my head out the window
Feel the wind, make me whole
Write my name up in the sky
As we contemplate goodbye
I don't know, we don't know, where we go

[Bridge]
Death is in the air tonight
I can smell the fear inside
We can see when we close our eyes
That's it's alright, (it's alright), it's alright
Promise me you'll stay with me (stay with me)
If just for one more night (one more night)
You can hold me honestly (honestly)
'Cause it's alright, (it's alright), it's alright

[Chorus]
There's a road that takes me home
Take me fast or take me slow
Throw my head out the window
Feel the wind, make me whole
Write my name up in the sky
As we contemplate goodbye
I don't know, we don't know, where we go

[Outro]
There's a road that takes me home
Take me fast or take me slow
I don't know, we don't know
Take me home[Chorus 1: P!nk]
Here comes, comes the weekend
Hear it callin' like a siren (oh oh)
We don't want no problems
We don't like them, keep it moving
Here comes the weekend
Set off your sirens (oh oh)
Here comes the weekend
Set off your sirens (oh oh)

[Verse 1: P!nk]
I just wanna play
Big city, holiday
So get out of my way
If you know
What's better for ya

[Pre-Chorus: P!nk]
I'm tearing up the night
Lipstick and leather tight
Not looking for a fight, no (oh oh)
High heels and cherry wine
Not wasting any time
We're ticking like a bomb about to go (off!)

[Chorus 2: P!nk]
Here comes, comes the weekend
Hear it callin' like a siren (oh oh)
We don't look for trouble
Just enough to see in double

[Hook: P!nk]
Here comes the weekend
Set off your sirens (oh oh)
Here comes the weekend
Set off your sirens (oh oh)

[Verse 2: P!nk]
Drink some pink champagne
I don't know you yet
But we'll forget so
Fuck what they say
Let's run the floor
Until it breaks

[Pre-Chorus: P!nk]
I'm tearing up the night
Lipstick and leather tight
Not looking for a fight, no (oh oh)
High heels and cherry wine
Not wasting any time
We're ticking like a bomb about to go (off!)

[Chorus 2: P!nk]
Here comes, comes the weekend
Hear it callin' like a siren (oh oh)
We don't look for trouble
Just enough to see in double

[Hook: P!nk]
Here comes the weekend
Set off your sirens (oh oh)
Here comes the weekend
Set off your sirens (oh oh)

[Verse 3: Eminem]
Yep, yep
Nothing high class in my glass, only bottles I pop
Are bottles of pop so when I pop up in the spot
I'm prob-ably not gonna be wanting to pop bubbly or Ciroc
I'm not Puffy, but I'mma run the city tonight
When I hit it, I might act like a fricking idiot
Diddy mixed with a medieval knight
Big city lights, little indignity
Hot diggity, this Biggie is getting me hype
I don't get some liquor, I'll hurt you, I'll knock your dick in the dirt
Bickering worse than that bitch in that Snickers commercial
A mixture of Stiffler and Urkel, hanging from the light fixture
I hope you pricks are insured for this building 'cause we're tearing it down
Security, get out the fricking way, Jesus Chrysler LeBaron its loud
I swear the only thing I hear is the sound
Of sirens going AHH AHH
'Cause

[Hook: P!nk]
Here comes the weekend
Set off your sirens
Here comes the weekend
Set off your sirens (oh oh)
(Oh oh)

[Hook: P!nk]
Here comes the weekend
Set off your sirens (oh oh)
Here comes the weekend
Set off your sirens (oh oh)[Intro]
Da da da da
Da da da da
Da da da da da

[Verse 1]
I don't know if I can yell any louder
How many times have I kicked you out of here?
Or said something insulting?
Da da da da da
I can be so mean when I wanna be
I am capable of really anything
I can cut you into pieces
When my heart is broken
Da da da da da

[Chorus]
Please, don't leave me
Please, don't leave me
I always say how I don't need you
But it's always gonna come right back to this
Please, don't leave me

[Verse 2]
How did I become so obnoxious?
What is it with you that makes me act like this?
I've never been this nasty
Can't you tell that this is all just a contest?
The one that wins will be the one that hits the hardest
But baby, I don't mean it
I mean it, I promise
Da da da da da

[Chorus]
Please, don't leave me (oh)
Please, don't leave me (don't leave me)
I always say how I don't need you
But it's always gonna come right back to this
Please, don't leave me

[Bridge]
I forgot to say out loud
How beautiful you really are to me
I can't be without
You're my perfect little punching bag
And I need you
I'm sorry
Da da da da
Da da da da
Da da da da da

[Chorus]
Please, please, don't leave me
Baby, please, don't leave me (no, don't leave me)
Please, don't leave me (I always say)
I always say how I don't need you
But it's always gonna come right back to this
Please, don't leave me
Please, don't leave me (I, I)
I always say how I don't need you
But it's always gonna come right back to this
Please, please, don't leave me

[Outro]
Baby, please, please, don't leave me[Verse 1]
Never win first place, I don't support the team
I can't take direction, and my socks are never clean
Teachers dated me, my parents hated me
I was always in a fight, 'cause I can't do nothing right

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Everyday I fight a war against the mirror
I can't take the person staring back at me
I'm a hazard to myself

[Chorus]
Don't let me get me
I'm my own worst enemy
It's bad when you annoy yourself
So irritating
Don't wanna be my friend no more
I wanna be somebody else

[Break]
I wanna be somebody else, yeah

[Verse 2]
LA told me, "You'll be a pop star
All you have to change is everything you are."
Tired of being compared to damn Britney Spears
She's so pretty, that just ain't me

[Pre-Chorus 2]
So doctor, doctor, won't you please prescribe me something?
A day in the life of someone else
'Cause I'm a hazard to myself

[Chorus 2]
Don't let me get me (no)
I'm my own worst enemy
It's bad when you annoy yourself
So irritating (no)
Don't wanna be my friend no more
I wanna be somebody else, yeah
Don't let me get me (don't let me)
I'm my own worst enemy
It's bad when you annoy yourself
So irritating
Don't wanna be my friend no more
I wanna be somebody else

[Chorus 2]
So doctor, doctor, won't you please prescribe me something?
A day in the life of someone else
Don't let me get me

[Chorus 2]
Oh, I'm a hazard to myself, yeah
Don't let me get me
I'm my own worst enemy
It's bad when you annoy yourself (yourself)
So irritating (so irritating)
Don't wanna be my friend no more (don't, don't)
I wanna be somebody else
Don't let me get me
(Don't let, don't let)
I'm my own worst enemy
(Don't let me get me)
It's bad when you annoy yourself (it's bad, it's so bad)
So irritating (oh)
Don't wanna be my friend no more (ahh)
I wanna be somebody else

[Outro]
Don't let me get me
Don't let me get me
I'm my own worst enemy
It's bad when you annoy yourself[Verse 1: P!nk]
Even if you see my scars, even if I break your heart
If we're a million miles apart, do you think you'd walk away?
If I get lost in all the noise, even if I lose my voice
Flirt with all the other boys, what would you say?

[Chorus: P!nk]
Could you?
Could you?
Could you love me anyway?

[Verse 2: P!nk, P!nk & Chris Stapleton]
Is it for better or for worse, or am I just your good time girl?
Can you still hold me when it hurts, or would you walk away?
Even if I scandalize you, cut you down and criticize you
Tell a million lies about you, what would you say?

[Chorus: P!nk & Chris Stapleton]
Could you?
Could you?
Could you?
Could you love me anyway?
Could you? (Aw, could you?)
Could you? (Could you?)
Could you?
Could you love me anyway?
Could you?

[Outro: P!nk & Chris Stapleton]
Could you? (Could you still love me?)
Could you? (Pick up the pieces of me?)
Could you? (Could you still love me?)
Could you love me anyway?
Could you? (Ooh, could you still love me?)
Could you? (Pick up the pieces of me?)
Could you? (Could you still love me?)
Could you love me anyway?
Could you? (Could you catch me when I fall?)
Could you? (And we rise above it all)
Could you? (And hold me when it hurts)
I can't stay here in the world, could you?
Could you? Could you? Could you?[Verse 1]
I dance around this empty house
Tear us down, throw you out
Screaming down the halls
Spinnin' all around and now we fall

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Pictures framing up the past
You're taunting smirk behind the glass
This museum full of ash
Once a tickle, now a rash

[Chorus]
This used to be our funhouse
But now it's full of evil clowns
It's time to start the countdown
I'm gonna burn it down, down, down
I'm gonna burn it down
9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, fun!

[Verse 2]
Echoes knockin' on locked doors
All the laughter from before
I'd rather live out on the street
Than in this haunted memory

[Pre-Chorus 2]
I've called the movers
Called the maids
We'll try to exorcise this place
Drag my mattress to the yard
Crumble, tumble, house of cards

[Chorus]
This used to be our funhouse
But now it's full of evil clowns
It's time to start the countdown
I'm gonna burn it down, down, down
This used to be our funhouse
But now it's full of evil clowns
It's time to start the countdown
I'm gonna burn it down, down, down
I'm gonna burn it down
9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, fun!

[Bridge]
Oh
I'm crawling through the doggy door
My key don't fit my lock no more
I'll change the drapes
I'll break the plates
I'll find a new place
Burn this fucker down

[Interlude]

This used to be our funhouse
But now it's full of evil clowns
It's time to start the countdown
I'm gonna burn it down, down, down
This used to be our funhouse
But now it's full of evil clowns
It's time to start the countdown
I'm gonna burn it down, down, down
I'm gonna burn it down[Intro: P!nk]
Woo

[Verse 1: P!nk]
I gave you soft, I gave you sweet
Just like a lion, you came for a sheep
Oh no, don't try to hustle me
You took my love, mistook it for weakness
I guarantee I won't repeat this
No, don't try to hustle me (Don't try to hustle me)

I live my life like a bullet in a gun
Give you all my love 'til my patience is done

A boy like you, you think you know it all
Build it up and you're bound to fall
Oh no-oh-oh, don't try to hustle me (Don't try to hustle me)

But you've been blind, you can't see the light
Oh no-oh-oh-oh-oh, don't try to hustle me

[Bridge: P!nk]
'Cause it won't do no good at all to say you're sorry now
Your words, they are falling on deaf ears
And it won't do no good at all to try to work it out
How can you replace all these years?
'Cause now you've gone and thrown away
The very thing you need
Bitch, please, don't try to hustle me

[Chorus: P!nk & Dan Reynolds]
Don't hustle me (Whoop, whoop)

I woke up with a fear this morning
But I can taste you on the tip of my tongue
Alarm without no warning
You're by my side and we've got smoke in our lungs

[Pre-Chorus]
Last night we were way up, kissing in the back of the cab
And then you say, Love, baby, lets go back to my flat
And when we wake up, never had a feeling like that
I got a reason, so man, put that record on again

[Chorus]
I don't wanna hear sad songs anymore
I only wanna hear love songs
I found my heart up in this place tonight
Dont wanna sing mad songs anymore
Only wanna sing your song
'Cause your song's got me feeling like Im

I'm in love, I'm in love, I'm in love
Yeah, you know, your song's got me feeling like I'm

[Verse 2]
No fear but I think I'm falling, I'm not proud
But I'm usually the type of girl that would hit and run (Oh)
No risk so I think Im all-in
When I kiss your lips, feel my heartbeat thump (Oh)

[Pre-Chorus]
And now were way up, dancing on the roof of the house
And then we make love, right there on your best friend's couch
And then you say, Love, this is what it's all about
So keep on kissing my mouth and put that record on again

[Chorus]
I don't wanna hear sad songs anymore
I only wanna hear love songs
I found my heart up in this place tonight
Dont wanna sing mad songs anymore
Only wanna sing your song
'Cause your songs got me feeling like I'm

Time flies by when the night is young
Daylight shines on an undisclosed location, location
Bloodshot eyes looking for the sun
Paradise, we lived it and we called it a vacation, vacation

[Pre-Chorus]
You're painting me a dream that I
Wanna belong in, wanna belong in

[Chorus]
Over the hills and far away
A million miles from L.A.
Just anywhere away with you
I know we've got to get away
Someplace where no one knows our name
We'll find the start of something new
Just take me anywhere, take me anywhere
Anywhere away with you
Just take me anywhere (Anywhere), take me anywhere
Anywhere away with you

[Post-Chorus]
Fun, little less fun
Little less, over, over, over, over, me
Me-me-me, me, me-me-me, me, me, me, me
Oh, fun, little less fun
Little less, over, over, over, over, me
Me-me-me, me, me-me-me, me, me, me, me

[Verse 2]
Truth comes out when we're blacking out
Looking for connection in a crowd of empty faces, empty faces
Your secrets are the only thing I'm craving now
The good and the bad, let me in
'Cause I could take it, I could take it

[Pre-Chorus]
You're painting me a dream that I
Wanna belong in (Wanna belong in), wanna belong in

[Chorus]
Over the hills and far away
A million miles from L.A.
Just anywhere away with you
I know we've got to get away
Someplace where no one knows our name
We'll find the start of something new
Just take me anywhere (Anywhere), take me anywhere
Anywhere away with you

Fun, little less fun
Little less, over, over, over, over, me
Me-me-me, me, me-me-me, me, me, me, me

Take me anywhere
Oh, anywhere
Anywhere away with you
Take me anywhere

Over the hills and far away
A million miles from L.A.
Just anywhere away with you
(Oh, anywhere, anywhere, anywhere, love)
I know we've got to get away
Someplace where no one knows our name
We'll find the start of something new

Little less, over, over, over, over, me

Me-me-me, me, me-me-me, me, me, me, me
Oh[Verse 1]
I should've stayed with you last night
Instead of going out to find trouble
That's just trouble (Mmm)
I think I run away sometimes
Whenever I get too vulnerable
That's not your fault (Yeah)

[Pre-Chorus]
See, I wanna stay the whole night
I wanna lay with you 'til the sun's up
I wanna let you inside
Oh, Heaven knows I've tried

[Chorus]
I wish that I could let you love
Wish that I could let you love me
I wish that I could let you love
Wish that I could let you love me
Say what's the matter, what's the matter with me?

Wish that I could let you love me now
Oh, I wish, oh, I wish, oh, I wish, oh, I wish, I
Oh, I wish, oh, I wish, oh, I wish, oh, I wish, I

[Verse 2]
And every time it gets too real
And every time I feel us sabotaging
I start running (Yeah, eh)
And every time I push away
I really wanna say that I'm sorry (Yeah)
But I say nothing (Yeah)

[Pre-Chorus]
See, I wanna stay the whole night
I wanna lay with you 'til the sun's up
I wanna let you inside
Oh, Heaven knows I've tried

I wish that I could let you love
Wish that I could let you love me
I wish that I could let you love
Wish that I could let you love me
Say what's the matter, what's the matter with me?

I wanna stay with you 'til the morning
I wanna lay with you through the sunrise
I wanna show you that you're my only
I wanna lay with you 'til the sun's up
I wanna stay with you 'til the morning
I wanna lay with you through the sunrise, through the sunrise
Oh-oh-oh-oh, Heaven knows I've tried

I wish that I could let you love
Wish that I could let you love me (Me, yeah)
I wish that I could let you love
Wish that I could let you love me
Say what's the matter, what's the matter with me?
What's the matter with me?

No, no, no, no, no love
Oh, I only want you

[Verse 1]
I don't want another night of tryna find
Another you, another rock bottom
I don't wanna wear another mini dress
To impress a potential problem
I don't wanna spend the night at someone's place
To fill the space that you used to walk in
I don't want another number in my phone
Someone to hold at three in the morning

[Chorus]
I don't want somebody like you
I only want you, I only want you, yeah
I don't want somebody brand new
I only want you, I only want you, yeah
Guess I had to leave, had to leave, had to leave ya
Just to need, just to need ya
I don't want somebody like you
I only want you, I only want you, yeah

[Verse 2]
I know I'm the one who ruined everything
And made you think that it was all your fault
And I know that sorry's only just a word
And when it hurts, it isn't that simple
But I know that if you look me in the eyes
You can't deny that we're something different
And I know I'm going looking for your kiss
On someone's lips to know that I miss ya

[Chorus]
I don't want somebody like you
I only want you, I only want you, yeah
I don't want somebody brand new
I only want you, I only want you, yeah

Just to need, just to need ya
I don't want somebody like you
I only want you, I only want you, yeah

R.I.P. to the girl you used to see
Her days are over[Verse 1]
I could have beer for breakfast
My sanity for lunch
Trying to get over how bad I want you so much
Innocence for dinner
Pour something in my cup
Anything and everything just to fill me up

[Chorus]
But nothing ever gets me high like this
I pick my poison and it's you
Nothing could kill me like you do
You're going straight to my head
And I'm heading straight for the edge
I pick my poison and it's you
I pick my poison and it's you

[Verse 2]
I can feel your whisper
And laying on the floor
And I try to stop, but I keep on coming back for more
I'm a lightweight, and I know it
'Cause after the first time
I was falling
Falling down

[Chorus]
But nothing ever gets me high like this
I pick my poison and it's you
Nothing could kill me like you do
You're going straight to my head
And I'm heading straight for the edge
I pick my poison and it's you
I pick my poison and it's you

Bittersweet ecstasy that you got me in (Got me in)
Falling deep, I can't sleep tonight (Tonight)
And you make me feel like I'm out of my mind (Mind)
But it's alright, it's alright, it's alright
Bittersweet ecstasy that you got me in (It's alright, it's alright)
Falling deep, I can't sleep tonight (It's alright, it's alright)
And you make me feel like I'm out of my mind (Mind)
Ohh, but it's alright, it's alright, it's alright, yeah, yeah

'Cause I've been sick and working all week
And I've been doing just fine (Hey!)
You've been tired of watching me
Forgot to have a good time, boy (Hey!)
You can't take it, all these faces
Never keeping it real
I know exactly how you feel

[Chorus]
When you say you've had enough
And you might just give it up
Oh, oh, I will never let you down
When you're feeling low on love
I'll be what you're dreaming of
Oh, oh, I will never let you down
Oh, oh, I will never let you down
Oh, oh, I will never let you down

[Verse 2]
There's a million ways to go
Don't be embarrassed if you lose control
On the rooftop, now they know
Your body's frozen and you've lost your soul

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause I've been sick and working all week
And I've been doing just fine (Hey!)
You've been tired of watching me
Forgot to have a good time, boy (Hey!)
You can't take it, all these faces
Never keeping it real (Yeah, yeah)
I know exactly how you feel

[Chorus]
When you say you've had enough
And you might just give it up
Oh, oh, I will never let you down
When you're feeling low on love
I'll be what you're dreaming of
Oh, oh, I will never let you down
(Uh huh, uh huh) Oh, oh, I will never let you down
Oh, oh, I will never let you down

[Bridge]
Let me take you where you never go
Have a little fun, it's the only way we know
Let me show you what you never see
You know how to love, only when you're holding me (Oh!)

[Chorus]
When you say you've had enough
And you might just give it up
Oh, oh, I will never let you down (Oh!)
When you're feeling low on love
I'll be what you're dreaming of
Oh, oh, I will never let you down (Oh!)
When you say you've had enough
And you might just give it up
Oh, oh, I will never let you down (Oh!)
When you're feeling low on love
I'll be what you're dreaming of
I will never let you down[Verse 1]
You say come, I go
When I'm high, you're low (Low)
Taking shots on the front line
Not out of love, but we out of time

[Pre-Chorus]
You're such a fool but so am I (La-la-la)
I may be twisted, you're unkind (La-la-la)
I wanna know what's on your mind (La-la-la)
You do the same thing every night

[Chorus]
We're falling to pieces, oh
All of the pieces come undone
We're falling to pieces, oh
All of the pieces one by one
Falling to pieces
One by one

[Verse 2]
Can a silver lining turn gold?
Another story untold (Told)
Why do we even try?
Not out of love, but we out of time, whoa-oh

[Pre-Chorus]
You're such a fool but so am I (La-la-la)
I may be twisted, you're unkind (La-la-la)
I wanna know what's on your mind (La-la-la)
You do the same thing every night

We're falling to pieces, oh
All of the pieces come undone

With you I'm comfortable, and I can't hide it
No I won't hide it, no

No, no, no, no, no love
Oh, I only want you

[Verse 1: Rita Ora]
I don't want another night of tryna find
Another you, another rock bottom
I don't wanna wear another mini dress
To impress a potential problem
I don't wanna spend the night at someone's place
To fill the space that you used to walk in
I don't want another number in my phone
Someone to hold at three in the morning

[Chorus: Rita Ora]
I don't want somebody like you
I only want you, I only want you, yeah
I don't want somebody brand new
I only want you, I only want you, yeah
Guess I had to leave, had to leave, had to leave ya
Just to need, just to need ya
I don't want somebody like you
I only want you, I only want you, yeah

[Verse 2: Rita Ora]
I know I'm the one who ruined everything
And made you think that it was all your fault
And I know that sorry's only just a word
And when it hurts, it isn't that simple
But I know that if you look me in the eyes
You can't deny that we're something different
And I know I'm going looking for your kiss
On someone's lips to know that I miss ya

[Chorus: Rita Ora]
I don't want somebody like you
I only want you, I only want you, yeah
I don't want somebody brand new
I only want you, I only want you, yeah
Guess I had to leave, had to leave, had to leave ya
Just to need, just to need ya
I don't want somebody like you
I only want you, I only want you, yeah

[Verse 3: 6LACK]
She don't want no remix, she want the OG
She told me she love the new me and the old me
Closely, I hold her up just like a nose bleed
I ain't cocky, but I know just why she chose me
If you wifey, then you gotta be my homie
I like her aura, she gon' be my one and only
I got a presence that they study very slowly
They running off with the drip, tryna clone me
I never tripped, though, gassed up like Citgo
Don't at me 'cause my wrist glow
Love me 'cause I've been ten toes down
And I promise it's gon' stay that way
You looking for another me, girl, I don't play that way
(No, no, no)

[Bridge: Rita Ora]
I don't want another night of tryna find
Another you, another rock bottom
I don't wanna wear another mini dress
To impress a potential problem

[Chorus: Rita Ora]
I don't want somebody like you
I only want you, I only want you, yeah
I don't want somebody brand new
I only want you, I only want you, yeah
Guess I had to leave, had to leave, had to leave ya
Just to need, just to need ya
I don't want somebody like you
I only want you, I only want you, yeah[Verse 1]
Where did it go, the love that we shared?
Guess we'll never know
Is it hidden behind that velvet rope?
While I'm standing alone out in the cold
Where did you go?
(Do-do-do-do-do-do-do)
Do your new friends know that it's all for show
(Do-do-do-do-do-do-do)
Or did you fool them all into thinking you're gold?
(Do-do-do-do-do-do-do)
Did you do as you're told? Will it ever get old?

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't you remember me, darling?
When you lay down to sleep, do you still think of me?
'Cause I remember you, darling
Without the sadness in your eyes
Now the champagne's running dry

[Chorus]
I heard that you been living it up, living it up
Where did I go wrong?
Only yesterday, you were beside me, -side me
Now I'm just another one
You're the one who's giving it up, giving it up
Singing that same song
You're the only one I want beside me, -side me
Now I'm just another one
Singing that same song

[Verse 2]
You were so high
I bet you felt you could touch the sky
Now you reached the top, was it worth the climb?
Oh, what did you find? Would you leave it behind?
If I were to say
(Do-do-do-do-do-do-do)
That since you've been gone it isn't the same
(Do-do-do-do-do-do-do)
That maybe I'm wrong and I've made a mistake
(Do-do-do-do-do-do-do)
By letting you go so far away
(Do-do-do-do-do-do-do)
(Do-do-do-do-do-do-do)
(Do-do-do-do-do-do-do)

Have you taking off your top right now
Tell them other guys RIP (R..I..P)
Rita and Kones
The English Bey and Hov, no tea and scones
I can tell by your look you're ready
We ain't even got to the chorus but I got you hooked already
You won't know where your head is
And I got a thing for them red lips
So girl you better take time
'Cause this poison ain't nothin' like a snake bite

[Pre-Chorus: Rita Ora]
Nothing ever gets me high like this (this, this, this)
Nothing ever gets me high like this

[Chorus: Rita Ora]
I picked my poison and it's you
Nothing can kill me like you do
You're goin' straight to my head
And I'm headin' straight for the edge
I picked my poison and it's yooouuuu
I picked my poison and it's yooouuuu
(Hah!, poison)

[Verse 2: Krept]
It starts with a "Where were you tonight?", yeah
She don't trust men, she can never choose 'em right, yeah
You want a bad boy, well I'm the realest dude alive, yeah
I'm poisonous, you took one sip and I'm killing you inside, yeah
I get why you mad at me, you acted drastically
Actually casually, poisoned you, made you a casualty
Then you came back to me, oh ma', you way too attached to me
Poison all in your veins huh, now you're saying you hate us
Telling me that you're leaving me, then the next day we make love
You're addicted

[Pre-Chorus: Rita Ora]
Nothing ever gets me high like this (this, this, this)
Nothing ever gets me high like this

[Chorus: Rita Ora]

I picked my poison and it's yooouuuu

[Bridge: Rita Ora]
Bittersweet ecstasy that you got me in
Fallin' deep, I can sleep tonight
Bittersweet ecstasy that you got me in
But it's alright, it's alright, it's alright
Bittersweet ecstasy that you got me in
Fallin' deep, I can sleep tonight
And you make me feel like I'm out of my mind
But it's alright, it's alright, it's alright

[Chorus: Rita Ora]
I picked my poison and it's you
Nothing can kill me like you do
You're goin' straight to my head

I picked my poison and it's yoooouuu
I picked my poison and it's yooouuuu[Intro]
Ooh, ooh

[Verse 1]
See, it's not that I don't trust you
I just wanna know every place that you go
Everyone that you know
Everything that you do
Every single move you make
And I ain't tryna play a victim
But I got my suspicions
Say you're alone
I can hear on the phone someone else in the back
What she doing? What she asking?

[Pre-Chorus]
What ya gonna do when the sun goes down?
Who ya gonna love when I'm not around?

[Chorus]
If you find a new look now
Would you kick the old one out?
If you find a new look now
Would you kick the old one out?
If you find a new look now

[Verse 2]
See, it's not that I'm a psycho
We both know it isn't my fault
You were the one who was out having fun
I've been out on my grind
I've been working all the time, yeah
And I ain't tryna play a victim
But I got my suspicions
Say you're alone
But if you ain't alone
You should say to me now
I ain't gonna stick around, say

[Pre-Chorus]
What ya gonna do when the sun goes down?
Who ya gonna love when I'm not around?

[Chorus]
If you find a new look now
Would you kick the old one out?
If you find a new look now
Would you kick the old one out?
If you find a new look now
Right now, right now
If you find a new look now
(Right now, right now)
If you find a new look now

Ooh, yeah, yeah
If you want, oh, if you want
What ya gonna do when the sun goes down?
Who ya gonna love when I'm not around?

If you find a new look now
Would you kick the old one out?
If you find a new look now
Would you kick the old one out?
If you find a new look now
Right now, right now
If you find a new look now
(Right now, right now)
If you find a new look now[Verse 1]
It's been seven long years fighting for your attention
Manipulated by fear and misdirection
Wrapped in your ugly chains, swore you'd rise me to heaven
Brought me nothing but pain, was that your intention?

[Pre-Chorus]
Damn frustrating that you think I could never make it
Look who's standing right in front of you
Yes, it's me
What you doing?
Did you think you would see me ruined?
After all the shit that I've been through

[Chorus]
I'm a soul survivor, I made it through the fire
I started with nothing, I've got nothing to lose
I'm a soul survivor, I made it through the fire
I started with nothing, I've got nothing to lose
Oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh

[Verse 2]
Gonna see your mistake, get it out in the open
Yeah, if you wanna play, let's get this rolling

[Pre-Chorus]
Damn frustrating that you think I could never make it
Look who's standing right in front of you
Yes, it's me
What you doing?
Did you think you would see me ruined?
After all the shit that I've been through

[Chorus]
Whoa, I'm a soul survivor, I made it through the fire
I started with nothing, I've got nothing to lose
I'm a soul survivor, I made it through the fire
I started with nothing, I've got nothing to lose
Oh yeah, oh yeah
Oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh, oh (Ooh)
Oh, oh (Ooh)

[Pre-Chorus]
Damn frustrating that you think I could never make it
Look who's standing right in front of you

[Chorus]
'Cause, yes, I'm a soul survivor, I made it through the fire (Ooh)
I started with nothing, I've got nothing to lose (Ooh)
'Cause I'm a soul survivor, I made it through the fire (Ooh)
I started with nothing, I've got nothing to lose (Ooh)

Black days
No headlights on the freeway
F*** everything and run, run, run
It's just a shot away
So blurry
Why is everybody worried?
'Cause I'm just having fun, fun, fun
There's nothin' wrong with me (Ayo)

[Chorus]
You look like you'd be heaven for a night (For a night)
Make me wanna die
It's a hell of a-

My ticket to the ride
It's a hell of a life
It's a hell of a life (Ayo, ayo, ayo)
It's a hell of a life

[Verse 2]
Dreamer
Or maybe I'm a make-believer
Or a fighter in the stone cold war
Against the colour grey
It gets heavy
Tryna take it slow and steady
Oh, I can't use your quick fix, a hit
There's nothin' wrong with me (Ayo)

[Chorus]
You look like you'd be heaven for a night
Make me wanna die
It's a hell of a-
You look like money, money, dollar signs
My ticket to the ride
It's a hell of a life
It's a hell of a life (Ayo, ayo, ayo)
It's a hell of a life (Ayo, ayo, ayo)

[Bridge]
Naked and unafraid
Washin' it all away
Come pick me up
(Oh, what you waiting for?)
Burnin' another day
Wasted and feeling great
Come get me now
(Oh, what you waiting for?)

[Chorus]
You look like you'd be heaven for a night
Make me wanna die
It's a hell of a-
You look like money, money, dollar signs
My ticket to the ride
It's a hell of a life
It's a hell of a life (Ayo, ayo, ayo)
It's a hell of a life (Ayo, ayo, ayo)

I stumble up to the window
Opened the curtains to blinding lights
Make up all over the pillow
What went on? What went on?
What went on last night?
You look so sweet while you're dreaming (Yeah)
Holding your bottle of Tanqueray (Yeah)

We got that sweet, hot loving
Dancing in the dark
Out in the streets, we're running
Shut down every bar
So put your arms around me, baby
We're tearing up the town
'Cause that's just how we do
How we do, that's just how we do
How we do, that's just how we do

[Verse 1]
City lights, blurry face
Been missing the feeling, the mistakes
Took a walk, fast pace
Shoes off, only four blocks to your place

[Pre Chorus]
Had to climb through the window 'cause you lost your key
Gettin' high with the lights low, had a few more drinks
And the next thing we know, your lips on me
Put it on so you can take it off of me

[Chorus]
Cashmere, left it lying by your bed

There were a lot of tears I had to cry through
A lot of battles left me battered and bruised
And I was shattered, had my heart ripped in two
I was broken, I was broken
There were a lot of times I stumbled and crashed
When I was on the edge, down to my last chance
So many times when I was so convinced that
I was over, I was over
But I had to fall yeah
To rise above it all

[Chorus]
Im grateful for the storm
Made me appreciate the sun
Im grateful for the wrong ones
Made me appreciate the right ones
Im grateful for the pain
For everything that made me break
I'm thankful for all my scars
Cause they only made my heart
Grateful, grateful, grateful, grateful, grateful
Grateful

[Verse 2]
I was sinking, I was drowning in doubt
The weight of all the pain was weighing me down
Pulled it together and I pulled myself out
Learned a lesson, learned a lesson
That theres a lot you gotta go through, hell yes
But thats what got me strong, I got no regrets
And Ive got only love, got no bitterness
Count my blessings, count my blessings, yeah
Im proud of every tear yeah
Cause they got me here

[Chorus]
Im grateful for the storm
Made me appreciate the sun
Im grateful for the wrong ones
Made me appreciate the right ones
Im grateful for the pain

There is nothing I would change
Not even one mistake I made
I got lost, found myself, found my way

Im grateful for the storm
Made me appreciate the sun

Im grateful for the pain
For everything that made me break

Midnight by a fire on the beach
At the end of my best friend's street
In the woods hiding behind the tree
It was love, at least I thought it was
After school in the parking lot
At a party after taking some shots
In the place where we might get caught
It was love, or something from above

[Pre-Chorus]
I never thought I could feel the way that it used to feel
Yeah, until you proved me wrong

[Chorus]
You hit me like the first time high, my love
You hit me like the first time high, my love

Ooh, ooh, ooh
Lemme get high on ya

At the mall in the dressing room
On the dock, lying under the moon
Backseat of your mum's Malibu
It was love, at least I thought it was

Yeah, until you proved me wrong

[Chorus]
You hit me like the first time high, my love

Maybe you can be enough to believe
There's something more

Are we gonna play? Play?
I just can't wait any longer
Let's get it on, turn it up all the way
Are we gonna play? Play?
We ain't gettin' any younger
Can't do no wrong, so turn it up all the way
Are we gonna play?
Cause all I wanna do is...

[Verse 3: Sage the Gemini]
And they already know me, S-A-G-E
I feel like I'm doin' it good
Steer your hips like a car and go under the hood
See I checked and it's good, put the key up in the ignition
Then I twist until it vroom, then I'm askin' you how it's feelin'
I know, I know only that time knows
So let's take this time to figure out what the hell time knows
And when we figure out, let's do that there
I feel like you the one so I'ma prove that there

[Chorus: Rita Ora]
Are we gonna play? Play?
I just can't wait any longer
Let's get it on, turn it up all the way
Are we gonna play? Play?
We ain't gettin' any younger
Can't do no wrong, so turn it up all the way
Are we gonna play?
Cause all I wanna do is...[Verse 1]
Her name is Lara, we learned a lot, ah

You should know, eh
You should know, ay

[Pre-Chorus]
All summer, we've been in the 'bu
'68 Chevy with nothin' to do
Just rollin' J's, kush lovin'
And last night, yeah, we got with the dude

So I said, "Hey, kush lovin'"

[Chorus]
Sometimes, I just wanna kiss girls, girls, girls
Red wine, I just wanna kiss girls, girls, girls
Sometimes, I just wanna kiss girls, girls, girls
Red wine, I just wanna kiss girls, girls, girls
Girls, girls, girls, girls, girls

[Verse 2]
You know I tamed it, and then I named it

We up all night, yeah (do it one more time)

She like it down on me, yeah
She like it down on me, yeah
Oh, we can go up[Verse 1]
I woke up with a fear this morning
But I can taste you on the tip of my tongue
Alone without no warning
You're by my side and we've got smoke in our lungs

[Pre-Chorus]
Last night we were way up, kissing in the back of the cab
And then you say "love, baby, let's go back to my flat"
And when we wake up, never had a feeling like that
I got a reason, so man, put that record on again

[Chorus]
I don't want to hear sad songs anymore
I only want to hear love songs
I found my heart up in this place tonight
Don't want to sing mad songs anymore
Only want to sing your song
Cause your song's got me feeling like I'm
Only want to sing your song
Cause your song's got me feeling like I'm
I'm in love, I'm in love, I'm in love
Yeah, you know your song's got me feeling like I'm

[Post-Chorus]
Yeah, you know
Your song's got me feeling like I'm
Yeah, you know
Your song's got me feeling like I'm

[Verse 2]
No fear but I think I'm falling
I'm not proud
But I'm usually the type of girl that would hit and run
No risk so I think I'm all in
When I kiss your lips, feel my heartbeat thump

[Pre-Chorus 2]
And now we're way up, dancing on the roof of the house
And then we make love, right there on your best friend's couch
And then you say "love, this is what it's all about"
So keep on kissing my mouth and put that record on again

[Chorus]
I don't want to hear sad songs anymore
I only want to hear love songs
I found my heart up in this place tonight
Don't want to sing mad songs anymore
Only want to sing your song
Cause your song's got me feeling like I'm
I'm in love, I'm in love, I'm in love
I'm in love, I'm in love, I'm in love
I'm in love, I'm in love, I'm in love
Yeah, you know your song's got me feeling like I'm

[Post-Chorus]
Yeah, you know
Your song's got me feeling like I'm
Yeah, you know
Cause your song's got me feeling like I'm

[Outro]
I'm in love, I'm in love, I'm in love
I'm in love, I'm in love, I'm in love
I'm in love, I'm in love, I'm in love
Yeah, you know your song's got me feeling like I'm[Verse 1]
Tired of sitting here in my room
Waiting for you to change
With my dress and my lipstick on
You should see it on me
It's such a shame
But I know about the girl you called
The one from the park with the pink heels on
We're damaged, uneven
Broken, I'm leavin'
I'm way too fly for that, yeah (Oh-whoa)

[Pre-Chorus]
I won't sit back if you want my love
You act like my love is not enough
Don't make me erase you from my phone
'Cause I can always go out alone
Who says you were the first and last?
I look in the mirror, know what I am
They say a love can lead you blind
Well not these eyes of mine

[Chorus]
So now I don't even care
Got my hands in the air
Gonna fill my tank and go
Me and all my girls gonna run around town
We can do whatever we want
'Cause I'm young, single and sexy
I'm young, single and sexy
London to New York City
I'm young, single and sexy

[Verse 2]
He'll be lonely on a Friday night
And that's just what he gets
I been calling him, calling all day (All day)
Yet he still hasn't called me yet
And when he does it will be too late, you know
I'll be at the party hanging with my mates
Who am I to sit at home
I'm too busy to wait
I'm way too smart for that

[Pre-Chorus 2]
I won't sit here and go back and forth (Yeah)
Don't act like it's okay you just got caught (Woah)
Constructors can't build this bridge back up
This is how it ends you're outta luck (Ooh-oh)
Who said you were the first and last? (Yeah)
I look in the mirror I know what I am (Woah)
They say a love can lead you blind
Well not these eyes of mine

[Chorus]
So now I don't even care
Got my hands in the air
Gonna fill my tank and go
Me and all my girls gonna run around town
We can do whatever we want
'Cause I'm young, single and sexy
I'm young, single and sexy
London to New York City
I'm young, single and sexy

Now I can dance when I wanna (I wanna)
Clap my hands when I wanna (I wanna)
No one can say come home
Out all night long, oh yeah
And I will not be bothered
If I wanna party till tomorrow
I'm sexy and free
That's how it should be
So come on, come on and do it with me, oh

[Chorus]
So I don't even care
Got my hands in the air
Gonna fill my tank and go (Fill my tank and go)
Me and all my girls gonna run around town
We can do whatever we want
'Cause I'm young, single and sexy

Hey, I wanna play with you
Let's run away, let's pick a rendezvous
Where we can both lay, baby, let's parlay
Boy, you can be my sunshine

Fallin' in love[Verse 1]
Don't wear my shades to be cool
I wear them to hide my tears from you
Behind the smoke, I'm so red eye
And I'm tired of you asking why
I said I've been lying to you, you, you
And I been lying to me too, too, too
My heart has been through hell and back
I'm only dressed and pretty in black
Middle finger when it comes to love
Act like I don't really give a fuck
'Cause I've been lying to you, you, you
I said I been lying to me too, too, too

[Chorus]
I've been lying, lying to you, baby
I've been lying, lying to me too
I've been lying, lying to you, baby
I've been lying, lying to me too

[Verse 2]
I don't always say what I want to say
I tattoo myself to show my pain
Lonely in a crowded space
Even though we're both face to face
'Cause I've been lying to you, you, you
Said I been lying to me too, too, too
Hurry up and wait for the spotlight
Looks like another whiskey night
What's inside, I never expose
They only see what the camera shows
'Cause I've been lying to you, you, you
Said I been lying to me too, too, too

[Chorus]
I've been lying, lying to you, baby
I've been lying, lying to me too
I've been lying, lying to you, baby
I've been lying, lying to me too

[Bridge]
It's like the whole world's getting at me
Tryna make everyone happy
That ain't me
Walking around wearing a smile
But deep down, I'm really fucked up
This ain't me
I don't wanna quit
Tryna hang with this
And figure out who the hell I am
I don't mean to make you run away
But I don't wanna forget to be me, yeah
The truth is I don't wanna lose you
But I don't wanna lose me too

[Chorus]
I've been lying, lying to you, baby
I've been lying, lying to me too
I've been lying, lying to you, baby
I've been lying, lying to me too
I've been lying, lying to you, baby
I've been lying, lying to me too
I've been lying, lying to you, baby
I've been lying, lying to me too[Verse 1]
By way of London, Americana
The persona, it's primadonna
Kick a muthafucka to the cizzurb
You think you crazy, I'm berserk
I'm off the chain, you gotta love it
I can't express enough, how bad I want it
Baby one day, I wanna be there
Beyond the stars, like a zillionaire

[Bridge]
I brought my clique up in here
Put them diamonds in the air
You can hate this all you want
But we gon' take this everywhere
Don't pay them, no nevermind
You're just a waste of time
Baby, watching from the sideline

[Chorus]
While I roc the li li li la la li li li, li li li la la li life
While I roc the li li li la la li li li, li li li la la li life
While I roc the life

[Verse 2]
I see the lights, I see the money
Super glamorous
Fresh off the runway
Wanna be infamous, notorious
As directed according to us
Whiskey nights, gettin' it in
Blowing money fast, get it again
Baby one day I'll live there
Beyond the stars
Like a zillionaire

[Bridge]
I brought my clique up in here
Put them diamonds in the air
You can hate this all you want
But we gon' take this everywhere
Don't pay them, no nevermind
You're just a waste of time
Baby, watching from the sideline

[Chorus]
While I roc the li li li la la li li li, li li li la la li life
While I roc the li li li la la li li li, li li li la la li life
While I roc the... li li li la la li li li, li li li la la li life

Oh-oh, we're gon' make this day last forever
Oh-oh, I'll make this the night to remember
No surrender, no

Write my name on stars

You should know, eh

All summer, we've been in the 'bu

You know I tamed it, and then I named it
I put the lion in the cage and then I laid with

I'm the thriller and the killer and the saviour
Up all night
We up all night, yeah (do it one more time)

It tastes good just rollin' off your tongue, right? (Hurrr)
I put this MAC on your lips, so pucker up (mwah)
We ain't never heard of you 'cause you ain't done enough (no)
And I don't gotta introduce myself (Cardi)
I'm too sexy, I seduce myself (Bardi)

A scrub is a guy that thinks he's fly
He's also known as a busta (Busta, busta)
Always talkin' about what he wants
And just sits on his broke ass

[Pre-Chorus: Chilli]
So no, I don't want your number (Uh, uh)
No, I don't want to give you mine and
No, I don't want to meet you nowhere (No, no)
No, I don't want none of your time and (Uh)

[Chorus: Chilli, T-Boz]
No, I don't want no scrubs
A scrub is a guy that can't get no love from me
Hangin' out the passenger side of his best friend's ride
Trying to holla at me (Whoo)
I don't want no scrubs
A scrub is a guy that can't get no love from me
Hangin' out the passenger side of his best friend's ride
Trying to holla at me

[Verse 2: Chilli]
Well a scrub checkin' me, but his game is kinda weak
And I know that he cannot approach me
'Cause I'm looking like class and he's looking like trash
Can't get wit' a deadbeat ass (Yeah)

[Pre-Chorus: Chilli (Left Eye)]
So no, I don't want your number
No, I don't want to give you mine and (Said no)
No, I don't want to meet you nowhere
No, I don't want none of your time and (Check it)

Hangin' out the passenger side of his best friend's ride
Trying to holla at me

[Bridge: Chilli]
If you don't have a car and you're walking
Oh yes son, I'm talking to you
If you live at home with your momma
Oh yes son, I'm talking to you
If you have a shorty that you don't show love
Oh yes son, I'm talking to you
Wanna get me with no money
Oh no, I don't want no
No scrub, love
No scrub, love

[Chorus: Chilli, T-Boz]
No, I don't want no scrubs
A scrub is a guy that can't get no love from me
Hangin' out the passenger side of his best friend's ride
Trying to holla at me
I don't want no scrubs
A scrub is a guy that can't get no love from me
Hangin' out the passenger side of his best friend's ride
Trying to holla at me

[Verse 3: Left Eye]
See, if you can't spatially expand my horizons
Then that leaves you in the class with scrubs, never rising
I don't find it surprising and if you don't have the G's
To please me and bounce me here to the coast of overseas
So, let me give you something to think about
Inundate your mind with intentions to turn you out
Can't forget the focus on the picture in front of me
You as clear as DVD on digital TV screens
Satisfy my appetite with something spectacular
Check your vernacular, and then I get back to ya
With diamond-like precision, insatiable is what I envision
Can't detect acquisition from your friend's Expedition
Mr. Big Willy, if you really wanna know
Ask Chilli, could I be a silly ho?
Not really, T-Boz and all my seoritas
Are steppin' on your FILA's, but you don't hear me, though

[Chorus: Chilli, T-Boz]
No, I don't want no scrubs
A scrub is a guy that can't get no love from me
Hangin' out the passenger side of his best friend's ride
Trying to holla at me
I don't want no scrubs
A scrub is a guy that can't get no love from me
Hangin' out the passenger side of his best friend's ride
Trying to holla at me
I don't want no scrubs
A scrub is a guy that can't get no love from me
Hangin' out the passenger side of his best friend's ride
Trying to holla at me
I don't want no scrubs
A scrub is a guy that can't get no love from me
Hangin' out the passenger side of his best friend's ride
Trying to holla at me[Verse 1: T-Boz]
A lonely mother gazing out of the window
Staring at a son that she just can't touch
If at any time he's in a jam, she'll be by his side
But he doesn't realize he hurts her so much
But all the praying just ain't helping at all
Cause he can't seem to keep his self out of trouble
So he goes out and he makes his money the best way he knows how
Another body laying cold in the gutter
Listen to me

[Chorus: TLC]
Don't go chasing waterfalls
Please stick to the rivers and the lakes that you're used to
I know that you're gonna have it your way or nothing at all
But I think you're moving too fast

[Verse 2: T-Boz]
Little precious has a natural obsession for temptation
But he just can't see
She gives him loving that his body can't handle
But all he can say is, "Baby it's good to me"
One day he goes and takes a glimpse in the mirror
But he doesn't recognize his own face
His health is fading and he doesn't know why
Three letters took him to his final resting place
Y'all, don't hear me

[Chorus: TLC (Chilli)]
Don't go chasing waterfalls
Please stick to the rivers and the lakes that you're used to
I know that you're gonna have it your way or nothing at all
(Your way or no way)
But I think you're moving too fast

Don't go chasing waterfalls
Please stick to the rivers and the lakes that you're used to
I know that you're gonna have it your way or nothing at all
But I think you're moving too fast

[Verse 3: Left Eye]
Come on!
I seen a rainbow yesterday, but too many storms
Have come and gone, leaving a trace of not one God-given ray
Is it because my life is ten shades of gray, I pray
All ten fade away, seldom praise Him for the sunny days
And like His promise is true, only my faith can undo
The many chances I blew to bring my life to anew
Clear  blue and unconditional skies
Have dried the tears from my eyes, no more lonely cries
My only bleeding hope is for the folk who can't cope
With such an endurin' pain that it keeps 'em in the pourin' rain
Who's to blame for tooting 'caine into your own vein?
What a shame, you shoot and aim for someone else's brain
You claim the insane, and name this day in time
For falling prey to crime
I say the system's got you victim to your own mind
Dreams are hopeless aspirations in hopes of coming true
Believe in yourself, the rest is up to me and you

[Chorus: TLC (Chilli)]
Don't go chasing waterfalls
Please stick to the rivers and the lakes that you're used to
I know that you're gonna have it your way or nothing at all
But I think you're moving too fast
Don't go chasing waterfalls
Please stick to the rivers and the lakes that you're used to
I know that you're gonna have it your way or nothing at all
But I think you're movin' too fast (Ooh, you're movin' too fast)

Don't go chasing waterfalls (Don't go, don't go)
Please stick to the rivers and the lakes that you're used to
I know that you're gonna have it your way or nothing at all
(I know, I know, your way hey)
But I think you're moving too fast[Produced by Dallas Austin]

[Verse 1: T-Boz]
I wish I could tie you up in my shoes
Make you feel unpretty too
I was told I was beautiful
But what does that mean to you?
Look into the mirror, who's inside there
The one with the long hair
Same old me again today, yeah

[Pre-Chorus: Chilli]
My outsides look cool
My insides are blue
Everytime I think I'm through
It's because of you
I try different ways
But it's all the same
At the end of the day
I have myself to blame
I'm just trippin'

[Chorus]
You can buy your hair if it won't grow
You can fix your nose if he says so
You can buy all the make-up
That M.A.C. can make, but if
You can't look inside you
Find out who am I to
Be in the position that make me feel
So damn unpretty

I'll make you feel unpretty too

[Verse 2: T-Boz]
Never insecure until I met you
Now I'm bein' stupid
I used to be so cute to me
Just a little bit skinny
Why do I look to all these things
To keep you happy?
Maybe get rid of you
And then I'll get back to me, yeah

[Pre-Chorus: Chilli]
My outsides look cool
My insides are blue
Everytime I think I'm through
It's because of you
I try different ways
But it's all the same
At the end of the day
I have myself to blame
Can't believe I'm trippin'

[Chorus]
You can buy your hair if it won't grow
You can fix your nose if he says so
You can buy all the make-up
That M.A.C. can make, but if
You can't look inside you
Find out who am I to
Be in the position that make me feel
So damn unpretty

You can buy your hair if it won't grow
You can fix your nose if he says so
You can buy all the make-up
That M.A.C. can make, but if
You can't look inside you
Find out who am I to
Be in the position that make me feel
So damn unpretty

And make you feel unpretty too
And make you feel unpretty
(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)

[Chorus]
You can buy your hair if it won't grow
You can fix your nose if he says so
You can buy all the make-up
That M.A.C. can make, but if
You can't look inside you
Find out who am I to
Be in the position that make me feel
So damn unpretty
You can buy your hair if it won't grow
(Hahahaha)
You can buy all the make-up
That M.A.C. can make, but if
You can't look inside you
Be in the position that make me feel so[Intro]
Yes it's me again
And I'm back
Oh I oh I oh I yeah
Oh I oh I oh I baby
Oh I oh I oh I yeah

[Verse 1: T-Boz]
The 22nd of loneliness and we've been through so many things
I love my man with all honesty, but I know he's cheating on me
I look him in his eyes but all he tells me is lies to keep me near
I'll never leave him down
Though I might mess around
It's only cause I need some affection

[Chorus]
So I creep, yeah, just keep it on the down low
Said nobody is supposed to know
So I creep, yeah, cause he doesn't know what I do
And no attention goes to show, oh so I creep

[Verse 2: T-Boz]
The 23rd of loneliness, and we don't talk like we used to do
Now it seems pretty strange, but I'm not buggin'
Cause I still feel the same, yeah, yeah
I'll keep giving loving till the day he pushes me away
Never go astray
If he knew the things I did
He couldn't handle it
And I choose to keep him protected, oh

[Chorus]
So I creep, yeah, just keep it on the down low
Said nobody is supposed to know
So I creep, yeah, cause he doesn't know what I do
And no attention goes to show, oh

So I creep, yeah, just keep it on the down low
(I think about us baby all the time)
Said nobody is supposed to know
(But you know that I'm gonna need some attention, yeah, yeah)
So I creep, yeah, cause he doesn't know what I do
(Love you forever, baby, soul and mind)
And no attention goes to show, oh
(And you gotta know it, if you don't give it, I'm gonna get mine)

[Bridge]
(So I creep) Oh I oh I oh I, yeah
(So I creep) Oh I oh I oh I, yeah
(So I creep) Oh I oh I oh I, baby
Oh I oh I oh I, yeah

[Outro]
So I creep, yeah
(I creep around because I need attention)
I just keep it on the down low
(Don't mess around with my affection, yeah)
So I creep, yeah cause he doesn't know what I do
(I creep around because I need attention
Don't mess around with my affection, yeah)

So I creep, yeah, I just keep it on the down low
(Oh I oh I oh I, yeah, oh I oh I oh I)
So I creep, yeah cause he doesn't know what I do
(Oh I oh I oh I, yeah, oh I oh I oh I)

So I creep, yeah, just keep it on the down low
Said nobody is supposed to know
So I creep, yeah cause he doesn't know what I do
And no attention, goes to show oh so I creep[Intro]

[Chorus]
Oh, oh, oh
This is All That

[Verse]
Check it, check it, check it
Now this is just an introduction
Before I blow your mind
The show is All of That and yes we do it all the time
So sit your booty on the floor or in a chair
Ground or in the air

So sit still cause we're coming right back

Now you want my love, well that's alright
Well it will be there for you, morning, noon and night
But you gotta be good, and do it right
Ain't got no time for part-time lovin' in my life
Well you wanna be loved, huh, hey that's okay
Cause it falls in line right with my sexuality
But you gotta be down, a nigga gotta be true
Cause otherwise this beat ain't got no time for you

[Hook]
Baby, baby, baby

Oh baby, baby
Baby, baby, baby

[Refrain: T-Boz]
Well, you want my heart, and all my time
But it won't be there if you can't deal with my mind
Cause a girl like me, won't settle for less
I require plenty conversation with my sex

That's actual and factual, but still I choose you
To be with me, and work on it, so you better not flake it up (Ohhh)

What, what about your friends?
What about
What about your friends?
What about your
What about your
What about your

[Verse 1: T-Boz]
Every now and then, I get a little crazy
That's not the way it's supposed to be
Sometimes my vision is a little hazy
I can't tell who I should trust or just who I let trust me, yeah
People try to say I act a little funny
But that's just a figure of speech to me
They tell me I changed because I got money
But if you were there before, then you're still down with me, yeah

[Chorus: All]
What about your friends?
Will they stand their ground?
Will they let you down again?
What about your friends?
Are they gonna be low down?
Will they ever be around?
Or will they turn their backs on you?

[Refrain: Left Eye]
Well, is it me, or can it be I'm a little too
Friendly so to speak hypothetically say?
I supply creativity to what others
Must take as a form of self-hate
Only to make an enemy
Which results in unfortunate destiny
They dog me out then be next to me
Just 'cause I am what some choose to envy

[Verse 2: T-Boz, with Chilli]
Every now and then, I get a little easy
I let a lot of people depend on me
I never thought they would ever deceive me
Don't you know when times got rough
I was standing on my own
I'll never let another get that close to me
You see, I've grown a lot smarter now
Sometimes you have to choose and then you'll see
If your friend is true, they'll be there with you
Through the thick and thin

[Chorus: All]
What about your friends? (What about your friends?)
Will they stand their ground?
Will they let you down again? (Woah)
What about your friends? (What about your friends?)
Are they gonna be low down (Be low down)
Will they ever be around? (Be around)
Or will they turn their backs on you?
What about your friends? (What about your friends?)
Will they stand their ground? (Stand their ground)
Will they let you down again? (Oh)
What about your friends? (What about your friends?)
Are they gonna be low down (Be low down)
Will they ever be around? (Be around)
Or will they turn their backs on you?

[Refrain: Left Eye]
Yo, is it me? Here we go
Or can it be I am a little too friendly?
So to speak hypothetically say?
I supply creativity to what others must take as a form of self-hate
Only to make an enemy, which results in unfortunate destiny
They dog me out then be next to me
Just cause I am what some choose to envy

[Chorus: All]
What about your friends?
Will they stand their ground?
Will they let you down again?
What about your friends? (What about your friends?)
Are they gonna be low down?
Will they ever be around? (Be around)
Or will they turn their backs on you?
What about your friends?
Will they stand their ground?
Will they let you down again?
What about your friends? (What about your friends?)
Are they gonna be low down? (Be low down)
Will they ever be around? (Be around)
Or will they turn their backs on you?

[Bridge: Chilli]
People say I act a little funny
I wouldn't change not for no money
I'll be a friend as long as you're a friend to me
Yeah, yeah (What about your friends?)
Even though I might be easy
It don't give you no cause to deceive me
It's not the way that I want my friends to ever be

[Chorus: All]
What about your friends?
Will they stand their ground?
Will they let you down again?
What about your friends? (What about your friends?)
Are they gonna be low down? (Be low down)
Will they ever be around? (Will they ever be around)
Or will they turn their backs on you? (Or will they turn their backs on you?)
What about your friends?
Will they stand their ground? (Stand their ground)
Will they let you down again?
What about your friends?[Verse 1: T-Boz]
I was like peace in a groove
On a Sunday afternoon
You were there, so was I
In the park, 4th of July
I was chillin' with my Kool-Aid
When Miss Chilli came to relay
That you had a thing for me
Finest thing you'd ever seen

[Pre-Chorus]
I must admit to you
I've heard them lines a time or two
Although for some apparent reason
Monkey lines are now in season
Lights off, lights on
I guess the groove is on, so I am

[Chorus]
Diggin' the scene, diggin' on you, diggin' on me
Baby baby-ooo-baby, baby
It's on like that, it's on like that
I gotta be in love or somethin' like that
Diggin' the scene, diggin' on you, diggin' on me
Baby baby-ooo-baby, baby
It's on like that, it's on like that
I gotta be in love or somethin' like that

[Verse 2: T-Boz]
I was like deep in a cool
What'nt gon' be nobody's fool
Could not care less who was there
Could've been like anywhere
I was chillin' with my Kool-Aid
Did not want to par-ti-ci-pate
In no silly conversations
Ain't no time for new relation-ships

[Pre-Chorus 2]
I must admit to you, when I heard the lines you threw
Although it usually turns me off
But this time you have turned me on
Lights off, lights on
I guess the groove is on and I am

[Chorus]
Diggin' the scene, diggin' on you, diggin' on me
Baby baby-ooo-baby, baby
It's on like that, it's on like that
I gotta be in love or somethin' like that
Diggin' the scene, diggin' on you, diggin' on me
Baby baby-ooo-baby, baby
It's on like that, it's on like that
I gotta be in love or somethin' like that

[Bridge: Chilli (T-Boz)]
Oh why do I feel the way I do? (Diggin', diggin', diggin' on you)
When all I can think about is you
What was it in a line, that made me fall for you?
Do you know, why I'm diggin', diggin', diggin', diggin' on you?

Diggin' the scene
It's on like that
Diggin', diggin', diggin', diggin' on you
And I am diggin' the scene

[Chorus]
Diggin' the scene, diggin' on you, diggin' on me
Baby baby-ooo-baby, baby
It's on like that, it's on like that
I gotta be in love or somethin' like that
Diggin' the scene, diggin' on you, diggin' on me
Baby baby-ooo-baby, baby
It's on like that, it's on like that
I gotta be in love or somethin' like that[Verse 1: T-Boz]
Take a good look at it, look at it now
Might be the last time you'll have a go 'round
I'll let you touch it if you'd like to go down
I'll let you go further
If you take the southern route
Don't go too fast, don't go too slow
You've got to let your body flow
I like 'em attentive and I like 'em in control

[Chorus]
Baby it's yours, all yours
If you want it tonight
I'll give you the red light special
All through the night
Baby it's yours, all yours
If you want it tonight
Just come through my door
Take off my clothes
And turn on the red light

[Verse 2: T-Boz]
I know that you want me
I can see it in your eyes (Haha)
You might as well be honest
Cause the body never lies
Tell me your secrets and I'll, I'll tell you mine
I'm feelin' quite sexy and I want you for tonight
If I move too fast just let me know
Cause it means you move too slow
I like some excitement and I like a man that goes

[Chorus]
Baby it's yours, all yours
If you want it tonight
I'll give you the red light special
All through the night
Baby it's yours, all yours
If you want it tonight
Just come through my door
Take off my clothes
And turn on the red light

[Bridge: Chilli with T-Boz (T-Boz)]
If you want me (If you want me) let me know it (Let me know)
I'll make time but you've got to show it (You've got to show)
If you need me (If you need me) I want to see (I want to see)
But don't mistake me
I don't want you down on your knees
I need someone (I need someone) a real man (A real man)
I need someone who understands (Who understands)
I'm a woman (I'm a woman) a real woman (A real woman)
I know just what I want
I know just who I am

[Chorus]
Baby it's yours, all yours
If you want it tonight
I'll give you the red light special
All through the night
Baby it's yours, all yours
If you want it tonight
Just come through my door
Take off my clothes
And turn on the red light

Baby it's yours, all yours
If you want it tonight
I'll give you the red light special
All through the night
Baby it's yours, all yours
If you want it tonight
Just come through my door
Take off my clothes
And turn on the red light[Intro: T-Boz, with Chilli (Ne-Yo)]
This goes out to forever
Through sunshine or the rainiest weather
And no matter what it will always be us together (TLC)

[Verse 1: T-Boz]
I said if I got nothin' else
I got memories of what we felt
I sit up laughing to myself
Sometimes, about it
Those silly reasons we would fight
But no matter who was wrong or right
We were always right there
Sharing this love, sharing this life

[Pre-Chorus: Chilli]
Cause we knew
Said we always knew
That no matter what would occur
That we were
Meant to be (Ayyy)

[Chorus]
And it ain't gonna be easy (Ayyy)
But no matter what, baby we're meant to be (Ayyy)
And we aint never not known that
We were always meant to be
Meant to be

[Verse 2: T-Boz, with Chilli]
And though, it'll get dark sometimes we know
Every now and then it's got to rain
But when that rain starts to pound
All you gotta do is turn around
And you'll find me right there
Holding you up, holding you down

[Pre-Chorus: Chilli, with T-Boz (T-Boz)]
Cause we knew (Cause we knew)
Said we always knew
That no matter what would occur
That we were
Meant to be (Ayyy)

[Chorus]
And it ain't gonna be easy (Ayyy)
But no matter what, baby we're meant to be (Ayyy)
And we aint never not known that
We were always meant to be
Meant to be

[Bridge: Chilli]
From the moment we met
Meant to be
Through the sorrow, through the stress
Meant to be through life and through death
Hey, we've built a love that nothing can test
Meant to be, yeah

[Chorus (Chilli, T-Boz, together)]
And it ain't gonna be easy (Said, it won't be easy, no)
But no matter what, baby we're meant to be (Meant to be, yeah)
And we aint never not known that
We were always meant to be
Meant to be, yeah

And it ain't gonna be easy (Said, it ain't gonna be easy)
But no matter what, baby we're meant to be (We were, we were)
And we aint never not known that
We were always meant to be
Meant to be (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)

And it ain't gonna be easy (Said, it ain't gonna be easy)
But no matter what, baby we're meant to be (We were, we were)
And we aint never not known that
We were always meant to be (Always)
Meant to be

Always
Meant to be

[Verse 1: T-Boz]
Thinkin' short of what you got
Better get it while it's hot
Ain't no better love than your own
Unmistakin' urge 2 be
Sexin' with society
How can you be happy alone?

[Bridge: Chilli]
I need to feel loved
Why wait 4 so long?
'Cause I ain't 2 proud 2 beg
4 something that I call my own
And I want 2 be touched
And feeling so much, see, 'cause
Everybody needs some good lovin'

And I know that he understands

I need to feel loved (I need to feel loved)

[Post-Chorus: Chilli & T-Boz]
Yo, Left Eye, kick that shit!

[Verse 3: Left Eye]
Realize the realism of reality treats us both the same
'Cause satisfaction is the name of this game
So I choose to explain, it's evident
Left Eye don't mean the rest of my body is irrelevant
In other words, let's refresh your head
About pullin' down curtains and breakin' da waterbed
Yeah, I like it when you (Mwah!)
Both sets of lips
Oooh, on the TLC tip!

[Pre-Chorus: Chilli with T-Boz]
I ain't 2 proud 2 beg (I ain't 2 proud 2 beg)

It's been a long, long time comin'
Ain't seen you around
Time keeps on passin'
But you still my bitch
Can't tell us nothin'
And it's nothin' but a thing, to pick up where we left off (yeah)

[Pre-Chorus: Chilli]
Don't you ever think
Back on all that other shit we went through
You know I remember (yeah)
Don't you ever wish
One day we could reminisce
It feels like, we were just together
Cause we go way back

[Hook]
Like Prince and Marvin Gaye
Like South side on Sunday
Some things don't ever change
Yeah, you and me
Cause we go way back
James Brown and Michael J
Like them high school parties
Some things don't ever change
Yeah, you and me
We go way back

[Verse 2: Snoop]
Twistin' up a twenty sack
Fishin', listen, reminiscin' bout the days of way back
Aye, where the ladies at?
I need to find one, top designer
Baby can you help me find one?
A real one, not a phony, I want a own me
Never leave me lonely, be my tenderoni
One hour photo together, take a few flicks together
That'll last forever
Whether, we do, you do? me too
See through it all, now creep with the Dogg
Don't let the rain drops stop ya, I got ya
This is so evolutionary proper
Now what the future holds, no one knows
But the past is a blast, game overload
It's like Good Times, my favorite episodes
I'm just the same OG, givin' y'all a little TLC

[Verse 3: T-Boz]
I'd like to think, when we were growin' (growin')
And shit got tough, we kept it goin' (goin')
Out in the streets, no signs of slowin' (yeah)
It's still nothin' but a thing, to pick up where we left off (yeah)

Don't you ever think
Back on all that other shit we went through

Like them high school parties
Some things don't ever change
Yeah, you and me[Verse 1: T-Boz]
You see, I had this brother who was mad at me
Cause I told my home girl that he wasn't packin'
Told the truth, so I really don't give a damn
That I spilled the beans on his little short stem man, oh
Some of y'all be foolin' us, big feet, big hands
Just plain big, but sex ain't worth a damn
We women wanna know these things
If y'all got the bat but not the swang

[Pre-Chorus: Chilli, with TLC (Left Eye)]
Put in work If you don't want the girl to talk
And you don't want your feelings hurt
Put in work Cause if you don't
That girl's just gon' go spreadin' the word (Yeah)

[Chorus (Left Eye)]
Girls talk got ya all caught out there
Why you thinkin' that it's all about ya (Why?)
Forget she told me everything about ya
But the girls are talkin', the girls are talkin' (Talk)
Girls talk about the booty too
About the way a brother is hangin' too (Uh)
When you didn't think that nobody knew
You see the girls are talkin', the girls are talkin'

[Verse 2: T-Boz]
Listen, y'all need to know this
That we'll straight up go tell your business
So if you're gonna come you better come with it
If you ain't swingin' just put your tongue in it, oh
Some of y'all be killin' me
Thinkin' you got powers like Austin, but you're more like Mini-Me
And when you finally get your blood flowin'
It be lookin' like a pinky with a glove on it

[Pre-Chorus: Chilli, with TLC]
Put in work If you don't want the girl to talk
And you don't want your feelings hurt
Put in work Cause if you don't
That girl's just gon' go spreadin' the word

[Chorus (Left Eye)]
Girls talk got ya all caught out there
Why you thinkin' that it's all about ya (Why?)
Forget she told me everything about ya
But the girls are talkin', the girls are talkin' (Talk)
Girls talk about the booty too
About the way a brother is hangin' too (Uh)
When you didn't think that nobody knew
You see the girls are talkin', the girls are talkin'

[Verse 3: Left Eye (Playa)]
What up papi, you think you got game? (Well holla at me!)
I know you're feelin' like my sexual tame can make you happy
You'll remember me, Left Eye, TLC
You got to lick it before you stick it and that's just me
I be killin' em with the Gucci fits and kicks
And you be hurtin' my ears with them lines so switch
And get a new approach, your game's a joke
Co-signin' from the sidelines tryin' to poke
I'm bigger than that, you're small talk, face the fact
You wanna rock the boat a little, well, earn your pass
And it's the last call for alcohol, meet at the bar
Me and my girls doin' it big, we pop stars, yeah

[Chorus (Chilli, Left Eye)]
Girls talk got ya all caught out there (Girls talk)
Why you thinkin' that it's all about ya (Yes we do)
Forget she told me everything about ya
But the girls are talkin', the girls are talkin' (About ya right here ooh)
Girls talk about the booty too (Ooh ooh ooh)
About the way a brother is hangin' too (Uh)
When you didn't think that nobody knew
You see the girls are talkin', the girls are talkin' (Woah, woah)

Girls talk got ya all caught out there (Yeah, uh, yea, yea yea)
Why you thinkin' that it's all about ya (The girls are talkin)
Forget she told me everything about ya (Yeah, what?)
But the girls are talkin', the girls are talkin'
Girls talk about the booty too
About the way a brother is hangin' too
When you didn't think that nobody knew
You see the girls are talkin', the girls are talkin'

Girls talkin', got ya all caught out there
Why you thinkin' that it's all about ya
Forget she told me everything about ya
But the girls are talkin', the girls are talkin'
Girls talk about the booty too
About the way a brother is hangin' too
When you didn't think that nobody knew
You see the girls are talkin', the girls are talkin'[Verse 1: Andre 3000]
Remember back in the time
When the only sign we had was pickets
But now in '94, it be this way, somethin' come wicked
G-angs killin' others for colors
Thangs that we wear for fashion
Other brothers take it for a reason to be blastin'
What the kcuf is goin' on
Not soft like buttercups but
Had enough of singin' that same song
See, I stayed across the street from the projects
Took out yo' momma trash and groceries to her trunk
To keep my pockets (Come on)
Fat, like cellulite only been to jail one week
For some shull-bit and I pray to God I won't repeat
I shoulda pulled it when I had the chance to
No, I shouldn't a did that, cause if I did that
Y'all would not hear dat phat shit
That keeps you on your tippy-tippy-toes
Like that sellout, not callin' no names
But really, "who's bad"
I go through obstacles like a whole box of condoms
You can't forget where you come from

[T-Boz]
Take a good look in the mirror
And tell me, do you like what you see
Masters of deception, corruption and evil
But you're always quick to point the finger at me
Won't somebody tell me

[Chorus]
I just don't understand
The ways of the world today
Sometimes I feel like
There's nothing to live for
So I'm longing for the days of yesterday

[Verse 2: T-Boz]
What gave you the right to misjudge me
And write me off on the wall
Acting as if you understand me
In reality, you just don't know me at all

[Pre-Chorus: Chilli]
Sometimes I can't help but wonder
If this was how it's meant to be
But if you search deep enough in your soul
You'll always find a slight reminder of me
Won't somebody tell me

[Chorus]
I just don't understand
The ways of the world today
Sometimes I feel like
There's nothing to live for
So I'm longing for the days of yesterday

[Verse 3: Left Eye]
A-yo, if we could all agree
To lettin' our souls become free
Of that sweet bitterness
Then who's chest would have the most seeds?
I keep misfocusin' my needs
And this stress on my back
With them gats they be blastin' into my knapsack
Ain't no accidental deathtraps
My mishap is the fact that I'm destined to snap (Yeah)
It's when I feel as though my body's able to go
My mind is ready to flow
Did you know first you catch and then I throw
It's my own sense of time
If I'm late, it's cause I'm endin' my day
Just when the sun shines
And still gently advising the arisin' of the moon
As it roams around into my soundproof dimension

[Chorus (T-Boz)]
I just don't understand
The ways of the world today
Sometimes I feel like
There's nothing to live for
So I'm longing for the days of yesterday (Oh yeah)

I just don't understand
The ways of the world today
Sometimes I feel like
There's nothing to live for (Hey)
So I'm longing for the days of yesterday

And you owe every mother in America (Just like you)
A public apology" (I get lonely too)

[Bridge: T-Boz & Chilli]
Every day I think I'm gonna meet ya
Can't wait 'till the day I see ya

Uhh, hehe

[Verse 1: Chilli (Left Eye)]
Sunny days
Birds singin' sweet soundin' songs of love (That's so pretty girl)
As we walk hand in hand
Just kickin' up sand
As the ocean laps at our feet (Ooh)
I'm in your arms
And all of your charms are for me
(It's not for me)
(Ha ha ha, jam, check it)

[Refrain: T-Boz (T-Boz, Left Eye)]
I need a crump, tight nigga, make seven figures
Laced with the platinum not the silver shit, nigga
Exhale cigar, ten inch or bigger
"Know how to lick it and stick it", what, what

Now don't get me wrong cause I'm not a ho (Uh, right?)
But I know what I got you can't handle though (Cuz what?)
Cause only real niggas, what?

Oh, hell no, wait a minute...

When I'm all alone, I touch myself (Ooh woah)
And I always dreamed about someone else
Who was so much more than
La, la, la, la, la
A good man is so hard to find

Well actually, a hard man is so good to find
Yo, yeah baby!

[Verse 3: Left Eye]
Uh, I understand you want a tour of what's inside
Read my safety guide before I take you on this ride
Straight into the center, you enter my dimension
The question is protection, selected in my session (Session)
I'm on a quest
I will not rest 'till I break it
But if it's naked?
I'll take it with the batteries and fake it (Fake it)
Cause I gotta get mine, and you gotta get yours
But never endin' it by sendin' it thru shakey doors
You must be crazy to think, that you can hang with me
I try to escape the imprisonment of those defiant to me
The epitome of your every dream it seems to 'feen
For intangible fantasies, you know what I mean?

[Chorus]
Nigga, you must be crazy (Haha, right?)
Whatcha gonna do with a bitch like me? (Like me)
I'm so good at being bad (Whatcha gon' do?)

I epitomize the word sexy (Ah, ah, ah, Yeah)
Nigga, you must be crazy (Whatcha gon' do? Crazy)
Whatcha gonna do with a bitch like me? (Like me)
You're not so tight (Whatcha gon' do?)
Make you cum all night (Whatcha gon' gon' do?)
And you can't handle me, baby (Uh, Ah can't handle it)

Nigga, you must be crazy (Watch out there now, haha)
Whatcha gonna do with a bitch like me? (Watch out there now!)
I'm so good at being bad (What? Uh)

Lean against the wall, checkin' out the scenery
All I see is everybody tryna get with me
So I continue to play it Crazysexycool
Lost all composure when I laid my eyes on you

[Pre-Chorus: Chilli]
We just wanna know if you can kick some game
Come with somethin' more clever than just your name
See it's like this, I wanna take you home
But you gotta show me that your game is on

[Hook: TLC, Chilli]
I've been watchin' you, watchin' me
And I know you want it
But it depends on how you kick your game
I've been watchin' you, watchin' me
And I know you want it
But it depends on how you kick your game

[Verse 2: T-Boz]
Club's about to close...but you've only said a few words to me
I've been waiting for a dose of your personality
See I'm in the mood and if all goes right
Baby, you will be, you will be going home with me tonight

[Left Eye, as Andre]
Miss Left Eye (Yo)
All I wanna do is kiss your hand
Let you know I'm not just another fan, I am the man
And I don't give a damn about who you know
I got a 48-track studio (Really?)
Back at the crib
So drop by, you know where I live
I see you all the time but on another note
Would you like to dance?
Nah, I'm about to go and, um, hang my coat

[Hook: TLC, Chilli]
I've been watchin' you, watchin' me
And I know you want it
But it depends on how you kick your game
I've been watchin' you, watchin' me
And I know you want it
But it depends on how you kick your game

[Verse 3: Left Eye, as Andre]
Lisa Lopes (Huh?), it's been a month
I called you twice
You called me once
Baby, come with me, and be mine
So we could make love on the 50-yard line
You for me, me for you
There's nothin' in this world you know we couldn't do
Yeah, but, uh, who, who was that girl all on your back?
Nicole...I'm just a nigga that followed you to the coat rack

[Pre-Chorus: Chilli]
We just wanna know if you can kick some game
Come with somethin' more clever than just your name
It's like this, I wanna take you home
But you gotta show me, gotta show me that your game is on

[Hook: TLC, Chilli]
I've been watchin' you, watchin' me
And I know you want it
But it depends on how you kick your game
I've been watchin' you, watchin' me
And I know you want it
But it depends on how you kick your game

[Outro: Jermaine Dupri, Woman]
Come on, let me kick a little game to you
Baby, baby, let me kick a little game to you
Come on, let me kick a little game to you
Baby, baby, let me kick a little game to you

What's good? Who you kissin on baby?
Who cares, you ain't tryin' to take nobody else home but me
So what difference does it make?

I don't have none a these hookers in my video
Well I mean ah hey, okay. I-I-I-I respect that but uh
So like, ya know I'm sayin'

Look in the broken mirror
I see the pieces of my face on the floor
What's it gonna take not to feel like this anymore?
Livin' for the outside but you're always lonely
Don't know who you are when the makeup's off... who are you?
Doesn't take much to lose yourself....

[Chorus]
Perfect girls ain't real...
They hide who they are inside
Perfect girls ain't real
They live a lie... but...
It's always on your mind
'Cause you're online all the time
Know that perfect girls ain't real
Gotta learn to love yourself
Gotta learn to love yourself
Inside and out

[Verse 2]
Playin' the perfect role
Cryin' deep inside, hoping nobody knows
Tryin' keep it together
House of cards don't fold
On every diet, I even starve myself
But he's still lookin' at everybody else
Guess it comes down to loving myself

[Chorus]
Perfect girls ain't real...
They hide who they are inside
Perfect girls ain't real
They live a lie... but...
It's always on your mind
'Cause you're online all the time
Know that perfect girls ain't real
Gotta learn to love yourself
Gotta learn to love yourself
Inside and out

[Verse 3]
Alone in the day time
Ragin thoughts going through your mind
Wishin' you had her life
Wishin' you was on the other side
You are beautiful inside
Don't you let 'em still your  pride'
You should learn to live your life
For yourself, no one else

[Chorus]
Perfect girls ain't real...
They hide who they are inside
Perfect girls ain't real
They live a lie... but...
It's always on your mind
'Cause you're online all the time
Know that perfect girls ain't real
Gotta learn to love yourself
Gotta learn to love yourself
Inside and out[Intro: T-Boz, Chilli, Left Eye]
Hahahaha, what up?
Sup T-Boz?
Yea, what's up Chilli?
What up Left Eye?
Yo, Left Eye, does she mean, I left? Hahah

[Verse 1: T-Boz]
Bein' that I am the kinda girl that I am
Nobody can make me do what I don't want to, uh
I can be myself a lot and I'm proud of what I got
So I'll never change for you
Bein' that I am the kinda girl that I am
Tight jeans don't hit the scene with one like me
I got to be feeling free
And you better believe I'll do what pleases me
Yo Left Eye, kick the scene

[Left Eye]
Every day, last week, and not a place to go
This nut still had me dressin' like a fashion show
But not this week I'm chillin' 'cause it's nothin' to hide
Threw on my baggy dips and waited for my ride
He pulled up (Knock-knock) till I opened the door
Peeped my gear and started dissin' me from head to toe
But yo, just to let ya know, it's takin' ta
Make me wanna say gotta go, gotta go

[Chorus: TLC]
Hat 2 da back
I gotta kick my pants down real low
That's the kinda girl I am
That's the kinda girl I am
Hat 2 da back
I gotta kick my pants down real low
That's the kinda girl that I am (Aww yeah)
(Here we go, here we go, here we go again)

[Verse 2: T-Boz]
Bein' that I am the kinda girl that I am
Some people just don't understand the things I do
(You feelin' it "D", you feelin' it?)
Chillin' with the girls or kick it with the fellas
If I choose
And bein' that I am the kinda girl that I am
Dumb rules are left for fools with no attitude (Hahaha)
I think my way is cool
So let me be me and continue bein' real smooth
Yo Left Eye, what's up wit' that guy?

[Verse 3: Left Eye]
So yo, get it back to this dude wit' the foul attitude
Shoot, he made another bad move sayin' that
Girls shouldn't wear baseball caps, he can go take a hike
'Cause it's the style I like, yeah, it's a trip
Cause somethin' hasn't yet been said
I never talked about them damn fingerwaves in his head
Tight pants and 2 rings in each ear
You know that is dead, but it's me instead

[Chorus: TLC]
Hat 2 da back
I gotta kick my pants down real low
That's the kinda girl I am
That's the kinda girl I am

That's the kinda girl that I am (Aww yeah)
(Here we go, here we go, here we go again)

[Bridge: Chilli]
(Here we go again)
That's the kinda girl I am
Don't cha know I really don't give a damn
Let me be me for me and not what I'm supposed to be
So I'm gonna do what I wanna do
'Cause dumb rules are left for silly fools
That's the kinda girl that I am, ohh
(Here we go, here we go, here we go again)

[Break: T-Boz & (Left Eye)]
Some people might wonder why we're like that
(Cause we're smooth)
Smooth as....ah

[Bridge 2: Left Eye, T-Boz]
Relatively speakin' I am no ordinary dip
'Cause I ain't reachin' hipped
Til you be thinkin' I'm flipped
And that is ooooh on the TLC tip

[Chorus: TLC]
Hat 2 da back

I thought that I knew about 'em
Thought that they would never do me wrong
Well, well they smile in your face
When all the time they want to take your place
Them backstabbers

[Pre-Chorus]
Same old scene that you've seen for so long
Always want to be around you
But as jealous as they come
Well, don't want you to win that race
'Cause if you do it's gonna lessen their space
That's when I decide to say

[Chorus]
Goodbye, goodbye
To all the fake people in my life
I never wanted you around me
So be on your way now
You better think twice
Before you let people in your life
'Cause when you put down
No one is around you
You got a case of the fake people

[Verse 2: T-Boz & Chilli]
I thought that I knew about 'em
The only ones that really cared for me
Oh yeah (No, no, no)
But they shouldn't be that way
Only down as long as
You can give security

[Pre-Chorus: T-Boz]
Same old scene that you've seen for so long
Always want to be around you
But as jealous as they come, well
Don't want you to win that race
'Cause if you do it's gonna lessen their space
That's when I decide to say

[Chorus]
Goodbye, goodbye (Hey, hey, hey, hey)
To all the fake people in my life
I never wanted you around me
So be on your way now
You better think twice
Before you let people in your life
'Cause when you put down
No one is around you
You got a case of the fake people

Goodbye, goodbye
To all the fake people in my life (In my life)
I never wanted you around me
So be on your way now (You gotta be on your way, hey yeah)
You better think twice (Oh no)
Before you let people in your life
'Cause when you put down (Ayy, ayy, yeah)
No one is around you
You got a case of the fake people

[Outro]
Uh oh
You got a case of the fake people
Oh, oh

(Yo, I'm checkin' for Left Eye man)
Oh God 'G', hm
I don't know God, I don't know God
I don't God, I don't really really know, check my flow...

[Verse 1: Phife Dawg]
My man Al B. Sure! "He's In Effect Mode"
Used to have a crush on Dawn from En Vogue
It's not like honey dip would wanna get wit me
But just in case I own more condoms than TLC
Um, speakin' of which, you know how I troop
Late Thursday night playing ball at run and shoot
I see my girl Chilli in her Lexus Coupe
Sittin' pretty, oohh, in that hot pink suit
And BAM!! In through the door she struts
It's the lovely T-Boz with the ill haircut
(But Left Eye's the dime piece)
Yeah, you know it's all good
But I heard...was a hood...
It's like that y'all
My name's Malik the Five Foot Freak
It's like that y'all
My name's Malik the Five Foot Freak
It's on the M-I-C-R-O-P-H-O-N-E I rule
TLC up in the house, CrazySexyCool
You know what I'm sayin?
(Word)[Verse 1: Chilli]
I never asked for this feeling
I never thought I would fall
I never knew how I felt
'Till the day you were gone
I was lost

I never asked for red roses
I wasn't looking for love
Somehow I let my emotions take hold
And guess what, all at once
I'm in love

[Chorus]
Oh I miss you so much
I long for your love
It scares me
Cause my heart gets so weak
That I can't even breathe
How can you take things so easily?
Baby, why aren't you missing me?

[Verse 2: Chilli]
Why did I act like you mattered
It was silly of me to believe
That if I just open my heart
Things would come naturally
Jokes on me, yeah

I did not ask for love letters
So why did you give them to me? (to me)
How could I let your intentions
Get over on me
So in love, so naive, oooh baby

[Chorus]
Oh I miss you so much
I long for your love
It scares me
Cause my heart gets so weak
That I can't even breathe
How can you take things so easily?
Baby, why aren't you missing me?

[Bridge: Chilli]
And oh, how I hate what you have done
Made me fall so deep in love
God knows you're the only one I want
That I love, oh baby

[Chorus]
Oh I miss you so much (Yeah)
I long for your love
It scares me
Cause my heart gets so weak (So weak)
That I can't even breathe (Can't even breathe)
How can you take things so easily?
Baby, why aren't you missing me?
Baby why aren't you missing me?
Oh, baby why aren't you miss, missing me?[Intro: T-Boz, Left Eye (Left Eye)]
Yes it's me again
It's me too girl
And I'm back
Don't forget the Left Eye
And Chilli in the house
Oh I oh I oh I baby (come on y'all)
Oh I oh I oh I yeah (check it out)
Oh I oh I oh I baby (come on)
Oh I oh I oh I yeah

[Verse 1: T-Boz (Left Eye)]
The 22nd of loneliness and we've
Been through so many thangs (Check it out)
I love my man with all honesty
But I know he's cheatin' on me
I look him in his eyes but all he
Tells me is lies to keep me near
I'll never leave him down though
I might mess around it's only
Cause I need some affection oh

[Chorus]
So I creep, yeah, just keep it on the down low
Said nobody is supposed to know
So I creep, yeah, cause he doesn't know what I do
And no attention goes to show, oh so I creep

[Verse 2: T-Boz (Left Eye)]
The 23rd of loneliness, and we don't talk like we used to do
Now it seems pretty strange, but I'm not buggin'
Cause I still feel the same, yeah, yeah (Check it out)
I'll keep giving loving till the day he pushes me away
Never go astray
If he knew the things I did
He couldn't handle it
And I choose to keep him protected, oh

[Chorus]
So I creep, yeah, just keep it on the down low
Said nobody is supposed to know
So I creep, yeah, cause he doesn't know what I do
And no attention goes to show, oh so I creep

[Bridge: T-Boz (Left Eye)]
I think about us baby all the time
But you know that I'm gonna need some attention
Yeah, yeah can you dig it?
Love you forever baby soul & mind
But you gotta know if you don't give it
I'ma get mine yeah

Oh I oh I oh I yeah (come on sing along y'all)
Oh I oh I oh I yeah (Left Eye, Left Eye, Left Eye...)
Oh I oh I oh I baby (Left Eye, Left Eye, Left Eye...)
Oh I oh I Oh I yeah

[Verse 3: Left Eye]
Oh I Oh I Oh I am the surgeon general
I do believe in lyrical miracles (Warning!)
Creepin' may cause hysterical behavior in the mind
Put your life into a bind and in time
Make you victim to a passionate crime
Pregnant women put themselves at greater risk of bein' dissed
Known as no one for not knowin' who the daddy is
Which may result in little kids growin' up by the dozens
Gettin' sexually involved with first cousins
Creepin' is the number one item on the chart
Rippin' families apart the leadin' cause of a broken heart
Injuries can be fatal may infect the prenatal
HIV is often sleepin' in a creepin' cradle

[Chorus (T-Boz)]
So I creep, yeah, just keep it on the down low (I Creep around)
(Because I need some attention)
Said nobody is supposed to know (Don't mess around)
(With my affection, yeah)
So I creep, yeah, cause he doesn't know what I do
And no attention goes to show, oh so I creep
Oh I oh I oh I yeah

[Chorus]
So I creep, yeah, just keep it on the down low
Said nobody is supposed to know
So I creep, yeah, cause he doesn't know what I do
And no attention goes to show, oh so I creep[Intro]

[Verse 2: T-Boz]
If I was your girlfriend
Would you let me dress ya
I mean, help you pick out your clothes
Before we go out
Not that you're helpless
But sometimes
Sometimes those are the things that being in love's about

If I was your one and only friend
Would you run to me
If somebody hurt you
Even if that somebody was me
Yeah yeah ooh
Sometimes I trip on how happy we could be
Please, yeah

Or your eyes too wide
Or your heads too strong
Either you got too much
Or you got too less
Either youre under woman
Or youre over dressed (ha!)

[Pre-Chorus: Chilli, T-Boz, Together]
All those opinions gonna make you fake
Go on and brush it off its just dead weight
Only thing that matters
That you need to know
Youll only find it in your heart and soul

[Chorus]
Whoa whoa whoa
Haters gonna hate
People gonna say what they say
But we dont care about that anyway
Whoa whoa whoa
Dont you ever change
People gonna say what they say

[Verse 2: T-Boz]
If youre lookin good
Then you must be dumb
If you aint got money
Then youre not someone
Either youre too young to matter
Or youre way too old (too old)
Public opinion is so hot and cold

[Pre-Chorus: Chilli, With T-Boz (T-Boz)]
So dont you listen to a word they say (Listen to a word they say)
They gonna keep on talkin anyway
Only thing that matters
That you need to know
Youll only find it in your heart and soul

[Chorus]
Whoa whoa whoa
Haters gonna hate
People gonna say what they say
But we dont care about that anyway
Whoa whoa whoa
Dont you ever change

We dont care what they say

[Verse 1: T-Boz]
I ain't one to be questioned
About who and where I've been
I ain't one to be questioned
About what time I came in
Tryna squeeze, baby please
Hit the road and don't come back
Cause I can't trust a relationship
With no trust and that's a fact

[Hook: T-Boz]

Don't take no mess from nobody

If they act up just leave 'em alone
Switch
Don't take no mess from nobody

When you're done wit 'em you can send 'em home

[Verse 2: T-Boz Chilli]
I won't answer to no one
Until I feel I'm ready to
I'm gonna have my fun
Doin' the things I like to do
See, I need space, get off my case
Stop breathin' down my back
Cause we ain't got a relationship
If that's how you have to act

[Bridge: Chilli]
Commitment, true devotion
Ohh, right now is not the way for you to come at me
When I need it, I'm sure you'll be the first to know
But for now, in my plans, no demands
I'm gonna have to make a switch

[Verse 3: Left Eye (Jermaine Dupri)]
Switch, throw his behind in a ditch
While my definition states, as it relates
To us mates, one eliminates
Solely contemplates and de-associates
Like my new drink was V8's
Just as quick as I get in it
I drop 'em in a minute
Like the dollars in my pocket
Speedy Gonzalez couldn't stop the way I spin it
I'm known for breakin' every speed limit
This switch could be infinite
I said L to da E to da (One time)
F to da T to da (Two times)
E to the, Y? (Three times)
Because I'm so fly (Uh uh)
Bring it back to the E
So come and see me
At the hotel, motel, Holiday Inn (Say what?)
I said if your man starts actin' up
Switch and take his friend
Erase, replace, embrace new face, come on
Erase, replace, embrace new face

Uhhh you know cuz the eye is right
Check out this phat remix kinda like Slim Fast
Baby baby baby
Ya know what I'm sayin'
T-Boz won't you kick the ballistics

[Verse 1: T-Boz]
Hey, you want my love?
Well that's alright
Well it will be there for you morning, noon and night
But you gotta be good
And do it right
Ain't got no time for part-time lovin' in my life
Well you wanna be loved (huh)
Hey that's O.K
Cause it falls in line right with my sexuality
But you gotta be down
A nigga gotta be true
Cause otherwise this beat ain't got no time for you

[Chorus]
Baby, baby, baby
I got so much love in me
Oh baby, baby
Baby, baby, baby
Cause if you're gonna get me off
You got to love me deep

Baby, baby, baby
I got so much love in me
Oh baby, baby
Baby, baby, baby
Cause if you're gonna get me off
You got to love me deep

[Refrain: T-Boz]
Well, you want my heart, and all my time
But it won't be there if you can't deal with my mind
Cause a girl like me, won't settle for less
I require plenty conversation with my sex

[Chilli]
Long as you know that I can have any man I want to
Baby that's actual and factual
But still I choose you to be with me
And work on me so you better not flake it up (Ohhhhhh)

[Chorus (Chilli, T-Boz)]
Baby, baby, baby
I got so much love in me (Gotta be true, you gotta be down)
Oh baby, baby
Baby, baby, baby (Oh my baby)
Cause if you're gonna get me off
You got to love me deep

Baby, baby, baby (Ain't got no time for the part-time lovin')
I got so much love in me
I gotta be loved if that's ok
Baby, baby, baby (Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby)
Cause if you're gonna get me off
You got to love me deep (Get me off)

[Chilli]
Baby long as you know that I can have any man I want to
Baby that's actual and it's factual
But still I choose you to be with me
And work on me so you better not flake it up

[Refrain: T-Boz]
Well, you want my heart, and all my time
But it won't be there if you can't deal with my mind
Cause a girl like me, won't settle for less
I require plenty conversation with my sex

[Verse 2: Left Eye]
Excuse me if I put a lot on it
Daggone it
As if you didn't know how much you want to really want it
In place it has effects in case your mind is in the gutter
I left the triple A's
And she surely don't stutter
A privilege it is to be considered as a great
And you remind me of my past cuz they are very upliftin'
And plan to give a little but a lot is what you want
And like my hat is 2 da back we can both sit down in front
I understand what a man is all about
You understand I can't have anybody else without a doubt
We understand that you as you I wouldn't want to be without
Understandin' is the key which holds a very large amount
And bein' that I am the kinda girl that I am
Heck just expect to be checked
Return the favor and the rest just flows
I'll be standin' on my toes as the rest turn into ho's

[Chorus (Chilli)]
Baby, baby, baby (Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby)
I got so much love in me (So much love in me!)
Baby, baby, baby (Oh yeah)
Cause if you're gonna get me off
You got to love me deep (Love me deep)

[Bridge: T-Boz]
I can have any man that I want to
Time and place that I choose to
But I'm thinking that I would rather be here with you, yeah
That's actual and factual
You're the one I seem to run back to, just to get me off
You got to love me, got to love me, gots to love me[Intro]
Hah, ha, ha, ha (T-L-C)

Whoa whoa whoa
Whoa whoa whoa, whoa whooa whoa
Whoa whoa whoa no (oww!)
Whoa whoa whoa, whoa whoa whoa
Whoa whoa whoa no
Whoa whoa whoa, whoa whoa whoa
Whoa whoa whoa no (T-L-C)
And I believe it don't affect nobody else but me

[Verse 1: T-Boz]
Y'all been telling me what to do
Since I was old enough to walk
Old enough to talk
Never let me speak or move
Do my own thang
But now I've grown wiser now
Brighter now
A little bit tighter now
And y'all can't hold me down
I know you hate to hear
But things have changed in

[Chorus]
My life
It's kinda wild but, me and my style stuck
Now everybody and they momma tryin' do it
My life
I've done that, been through that
So there ain't nothin' that you can tell me
My life
On a good night, if I feel like
Me and the girls hit the club and tear it up
It's my life, it's my life
And I believe it don't effect nobody else but me, me, me, me

[Verse 2: T-Boz]
I'm getting sick and tired of folks who wanna come around
Claim they gon' get down
But all they wanna do is see me make a wrong move, yeah
I don't care what you hear in the news
Or see who I choose to do the late night creep with
I'm gonna do just what I wanna do
It's my life

[Chorus]
My life
It's kinda wild but, me and my style stuck
Now everybody and they momma tryin' do it
My life
I've done that, been through that
So there ain't nothin' that you can tell me
My life
On a good night, if I feel like
Me and the girls hit the club and tear it up
It's my life, it's my life
And I believe it don't effect nobody else but me, me, me, me

[Break]
Whoa whoa whoa (Ohh hoo)
Whoa whoa whoa, whoa whoa whoa
Whoa whoa whoa no (Ohhh)
Whoa whoa whoa, whoa whoa whoa
Whoa whoa whoa no (Ooohh)
Whoa whoa whoa, whoa whoa whoa
Whoa whoa whoa no (Ooh ooh)
And I believe it don't affect nobody else but me

[Bridge: Chilli]
Sometimes I might get a little crazy
And sometimes I might seem out of hand
But I'm sayin' life's too short for me to let you dictate
What I say and the moves I make
I'm sick of people tryna tell me what to do
It's my life and I'mma live it like I want to!

[Verse 3: Left Eye]
Check it
Another day another dollar
Is the reality of my mentality
Otherwise don't even botha (Uh huh)
You see my father was a wise old man
Always creatin' a plan for me to conquer this land (T-L-C)
He said I am what I am
So be the best that I can
And if them others don't like it
Then why should I give a damn (huh)
Maybe so cause when his life wasn't right (T-L-C)
My mother picked up them pieces
Continued on with the fight
So now it's plain to me
It ain't no game to me
See mom and dad corrected math, 1 and 1 equal 3
4 and 5 I count my sister and brother
Stay alive till we die
And don't you ever be worried
Cause I'm down with the ride
Through peaks and valleys, no Crescent Hills
Tumble down, I'll set a new ground for Jack and Jill's
Ever wonder what put the thunder deeply in my eyes?
Take a look and you'll find the sunshine
My life, my life, my life

[Chorus]
My life
It's kinda wild but, me and my style stuck
Now everybody and they momma tryin' do it
My life
I've done that, been through that
So there ain't nothin' that you can tell me
My life
On a good night, if I feel like
Me and the girls hit the club and tear it up
It's my life, it's my life
And I believe it don't effect nobody else but me, me, me, me

My life
It's kinda wild but, me and my style stuck
Now everybody and they momma tryin' do it
My life
I've done that, been through that
So there ain't nothin' that you can tell me
My life
On a good night, if I feel like
Me and the girls hit the club and tear it up
It's my life, it's my life
And I believe it don't effect nobody else but me, me, me, me[Intro: T-Boz (Chilli)]

Are you ready to make me feel the definition of a man (Man?)

[Pre-Chorus 1: Chilli (T-Boz)]
You give me pleasure (Give me pleasure, yeah)
Unlike any pleasure that I've felt or ever seen

You know I treasure
Each and every waking moment that you spend with me
I'm in ecstasy

[Chorus]

I know I'm kinda strange
To you sometimes
Don't always say
What's on my mind
You know that I've been hurt
By some guy
But I don't wanna mess up
This time

[Bridge: T-Boz and Chilli]
And I really really really care
And I really really really want you
And I think I'm kinda scared
'Cause I don't wanna lose you
If you're really really really there
Then maybe you can hang through
I hope you understand
It's nothin' to you

[Chorus]
My heart's at a low
I'm so much to manage
I think you should know that
I've been damaged
I'm fallin' in love
There's one disadvantage
I think you should know that
I've been damaged

[Verse 2: T-Boz]
I might look through your stuff
For what I don't wanna find
Or I might just set you up
To see if you're all mine
I'm a little paranoid
From what I've been through
Don't know what you got
Yourself into

[Bridge: T-Boz and Chilli]
And I really really really care
And I really really really want you
And I think I'm kinda scared
'Cause I don't wanna lose you
If you're really really really there
Then maybe you can hang through
I hope you understand
It's nothin' to you

[Chorus]
My heart's at a low
I'm so much to manage
I think you should know that
I've been damaged
I'm fallin' in love
There's one disadvantage
I think you should know that
I've been damaged
My heart's at a low
I'm so much to manage
I think you should know that
I've been damaged
I'm fallin' in love
There's one disadvantage
I think you should know that
I've been damaged

[Bridge]
And I really really really care
And I really really really want you
And I think I'm kinda scared
'Cause I don't wanna lose you
If you're really really really there
Then maybe you can hang through
I hope you understand
It's nothin' to you

[Chorus]
My heart's at a low
I'm so much to manage
I think you should know that
I've been damaged
I'm fallin' in love
There's one disadvantage
I think you should know that
I've been damaged[Intro]
Ahh, hahah

Makin' it he's in what is pleasin' cause yo, I gots one

Not two hangin' hairy wit' dairy airy
'Cause to impress me is not to undress me
Dat's only unless we agree, you down wit' O.P.P
And bein' honestly is what I want you to be
You wanna control me, you need much authority
Understanding the depths of the 90s women
That is the way dat I'm livin'

[Chorus: All]
Das da way we like 'em (Ooh)
Das da way we like 'em (Uhh)
Das da way we like 'em (Das da way)

What up, what up, yo

Or better yet, let's talk about the way I dislike
The type dat's always out to despite
Or what about the ones
The ones dat's under your feet
Or like to wipe your butt before you're leavin' the dookey seat
But so, take your time and you'll find dat it is true
I like the ones (That!)
Walk through the parties wit' their pants saggin' down
Spend a little time wit' me and not wit' the crowd
Chillin' in the crib wit' da docs on
Maxin' on the couch to a Babyface song, yeah
Understanding the depth of cool women
Uhh, cause dat's the way T-Boz is livin'

[Chorus: All]
Das da way we like 'em
Das da way we like 'em
Das da way we like 'em (Da way we like 'em)
Das da way we like 'em (Yo erri uuhh erri erri hahahaha)

[Verse 3: Chilli]
I like a man with romance in his heart
And the ability to chik-chik take on the part
Not the kind who be tippin' and tappin'
Slippin' and slappin' 'em
'Cause I'll be out there wit' a bat and start smackin' him
But wait a minute, I ain't dealin' like that, NO!
I need a man who's gonna venture out at pleasin'
Yeah, dats me, hey
'Cause I'm the kind who'll be givin' it right back
But on the serious tip, he's gotta come with respect
'Cause that's where I'm at, doh
Understanding the depths of the good women
Yeah that's me cuz that's the way aat Chilli's livin' hahahaha

[Chorus: All]
Das da way we like 'em

Dear lie, you suck
You said you could fix anything
Instead I'm fucked
You made things even worse for me
If I had balls
I'd tell you "get away from me"
Guess I'm not smart
I let you unnerve me
I let you control me
Afraid that the truth would hurt me
When it's you that hurts me more

[Chorus]
Get outta my mouth
Get outta my hair
Get outta my mind
Stop puttin' words in my head
Get outta my mouth
You're nothing but trouble
Get outta my life
Get out of me
Out of me, out of me, out of me, lie
Lie, lie, lie, lie, lie

[Verse 2]
Dear lie, you're dumb
You think you've got the best of me
You think you've won
Misread my vulnerability
I've got, your balls (I've got, your balls)
Now get the hell away from me
I've learned ,your heart (I've learned, your heart)
Won't let you unnerve me
Won't let you control me
The truth will only free me
And your lies won't hurt no, no more

[Chorus]
Get outta my mouth
Get outta my hair
Get outta my mind
Stop puttin' words in my head
Get outta my mouth
You're nothing but trouble
Get outta my life
Get out of me
Out of me, out of me, out of me, lie
Lie, lie, lie, lie, lie

[Bridge]

Won't let you unnerve me
Won't let you control me
The truth will only free me
And your lies won't hurt no, no more

[Chorus]
Get outta my mouth
Get outta my hair
Get outta my mind

Pride starts wars
Seems love has died too soon
When will we try?

[Verse 1]
I'll give breath to save your life
Bombs are falling from the sky
I'll be bold enough to fight
By your side, by your side
I think none of us are safe
We been in and out the race
Cries they echo into space
Tragedies we have to face

[Pre-Chorus]
I lost some friends
Some friends that I didn't want to
I lost some stars
My heart bleeds red, white, and blue
I've been in and out of the fire battling for you
Oh, bleeding on American soil

[Chorus]
I bleed American gold
On this American soil
We pay for the price it cost
I bleed this American gold
I cry for the ones I lost
I pray for the ones that don't
I'm bleeding on American Soil
I'm bleeding this American gold

[Post-Chorus]
I'm bleeding yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I'm bleeding American gold, gold, gold, yeah, yeah
It's leaking from my soul (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
I'm bleeding American gold, gold, gold, yeah, yeah

[Verse 2]
Feeling undefeated
From the ones who try to have power over you
Don't let them control you
Can't let them get through, get through
Won't you let them know right now
You won't let them drag you
Yeah, you always gon' pull through, pull through
You're coming out strong, strong, strong

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus]

[Post-Chorus][Intro: Left-Eye]
Yo, this is a story of a male female threat to society
You know being misjudged and not respected for what we are
But I want to send this special shout out to my girl Tawana Brawley
'Cause no matter what we say or what we do
They'll always believe his story (Oww)

[Hook]
His story (Yeahee, yeahee, yeahee)
His story (Oww)
They're gonna believe
His story
His story

[Verse 1: T-Boz]
Why does it have to be that we get labeled for what we do
It's hard enough for us to be ourselves without being used
Girls have an image too
But when they get mad at you
There is no telling what they'll say to hurt you

[Bridge: Chilli]
This is a story of a male female threat to society
Why you wanna go and tell a lie on me? (Yeahee, yeahee, oooh)

[TLC]
His story over mine his story will be his story
And my story is a waste of time (Aaaah-aah-aah)
They're gonna believe

[Hook]
His story (Yeahee, yeahee, yeahee)
His story (Oww)
They're gonna believe
His story
His story

[Verse 2: T-Boz]
Sometimes I feel like there is no reason for me to explain
No matter how much we complain
You know it all stays the same
They try to call us freaks
Why does it have to be
We can't get justified until we speak up (Oooh)

[Bridge: Chilli]
This is a story of a male female threat to society
Why you wanna go and tell a lie on me? (Yeah, yeah, oooh)

[TLC]
His story over mine his story will be his story
And my story is a waste of time (Aaaah-aah-aah)
(You know it's just a waste of my time)
They're gonna believe
His story over mine
So what you gonna do?
Don't let it take over you, hey
My story is a waste of time
It's hard enough for us to be ourselves without being used
(This-this-this-this-this-this-this-the-this-this)

[Break: Left Eye]
So yo take it from me
Don't be a victim of society
You can't put yourself in a position to be neglected
And disrespected
You have to do what's not expected
Or we'll all be his story

His story over mine
His story will be his story

(This is a story of) how could you do this to us
They're gonna believe
His story over mine
His story will be his story and
My story is a waste of time
They're gonna believe
His story over mine
His story will be his story
And my story is a waste of time
You're gonna believe

This is a story of a male female threat to society
Why you wanna go and tell a lie on me? (yeah, yeah)
This is a story (Peace, love and hair and grease from TLC) of a male
Female threat to society
Why you wanna go tell a lie on me? (Yeahee, yeahee, ho)[Intro]

So I heard you found somebody else
And at first, I thought it was a lie
I took all my things that make sounds
The rest I can do without

[Chorus]
I don't want your body
But I hate to think about you with somebody else
Our love has gone cold
You're intertwining your soul with somebody else
I'm looking through you
While you're looking through your phone
And then leaving with somebody else
No, I don't want your body
But I'm picturing your body with somebody else (Else, else...)

[Post-Chorus]
I don't want your body, I don't want your body
I don't want your body, I don't want your body
I don't want your body, I don't want your body
I don't want your body, I don't want your body

[Verse 2]
And c'mon baby (I know)
This ain't the last time that I'll see your face
And c'mon baby (I know)
You said you'd find someone to take my place (Place, place)

[Pre-Chorus]
I just don't believe that you have got it in you
'Cause we are just gonna keep Doin' it and every time
I start to believe in anything you're saying
I'm reminded that I should be gettin' over it

[Chorus]
I don't want your body
But I hate to think about you with somebody else
Our love has gone cold
You're intertwining your soul with somebody else
I'm looking through you
While you're looking through your phone
And then leaving with somebody else
No, I don't want your body
But I'm picturing your body with somebody else (Else, else...)

[Post-Chorus]
I don't want your body, I don't want your body
I don't want your body, I don't want your body
I don't want your body, I don't want your body
I don't want your body, I don't want your body

[Bridge]
Get someone you love?
Get someone you need?
Fuck that, get money
I can't give you my soul, 'cause we're never alone
Get someone you love?

Fuck that, get money
I can't give you my soul, 'cause we're never alone
Get someone you love?

We're fucking in a car, shooting heroin
Saying controversial things just for the hell of it
Selling melanin and then suffocate the black men
Start with misdemeanours and we'll make a business out of them
And we can find out the information
Access all the applications
That are hardening positions based on miscommunication
Oh, fuck your feelings
Truth is only hearsay
We're just left to decay
Modernity has failed us

[Chorus]
And I'd love it if we made it
Yes, I'd love it if we made it
Yes, I'd love it if we made it
Yes, I'd love it if we made it

[Verse 2]
And poison me, daddy
I got the Jones right through my bones
Write it on a piece of stone
A beach of drowning three-year olds
Rest in peace Lil Peep
The poetry is in the streets
Jesus save us
Modernity has failed us

[Chorus]
And I'd love it if we made it
Yes, I'd love it if we made it
Yes, I'd love it if we made it
Yes, I'd love it if we made it
And I'd love it if we made it
And I'd love it if we made it
And I'd love it if we made it
I'd love it if we made it

Tell me something I didn't know

[Bridge]
Consultation
Degradation
Fossil fueling
Masturbation
Immigration
Liberal kitsch
Kneeling on a pitch

[Verse 3]
"I moved on her like a bitch!"
Excited to be indicted
Unrequited house with seven pools
"Thank you Kanye, very cool!"
The war has been incited
And guess what, you're all invited
And you're famous
Modernity has failed us

[Outro]
And I'd love it if we made it
And I'd love it if we made it
And I'd love it if we made it
Tell me something I didn't know
And I'd love it if we made it
And I'd love it if we made it
And I'd love it if we made it
And I'd love it if we made it[Verse 1]
She had a face straight out a magazine
God only knows but you'll never leave her
Her balaclava is starting to chafe
And when she gets his gun, he's begging, "Babe stay, stay, stay"

[Chorus]
"I'll give you one more time
We'll give you one more fight
Said one more line
Will I know you?"

[Verse 2]
Now if you never shoot, you'll never know
And if you never eat, you'll never grow
You've got a pretty kind of dirty face
And when she's leaving your home she's begging you to stay, stay, stay, stay, stay

[Chorus]
"I'll give you one more time
We'll give you one more fight
Said one more line
There'll be a riot, 'cause I know you"

[Bridge]
Well now that you've got your gun
It's much harder now the police have come
And I'll shoot him if it's what you ask
But if you'd just take off your mask
You'd find out everything's gone wrong

[Outro]
Now everybody's dead
And they're driving past my old school
And he's got his gun, he's got his suit on
She says, "Babe, you look so cool
You look so cool, you look so cool
You look so cool, you look so cool
You look so cool"
('Cause I know you)
(Side Fact)And this is how it starts
You take your shoes off in the back of my van
Yeah my shirt looks so good
When it's just hanging off your back

And she said use your hands and my spare time
We've got one thing in common, it's this tongue of mine
She's got a boyfriend anyway

There's only minutes before I drop you off
All we seem to do is talk about sex
She's got a boyfriend anyway
She's got a boyfriend anyway

I loved your friend when I saw his film
He's got a funny face, but I like that cause he still looks cool
She's got a boyfriend anyway
She's got a boyfriend anyway

Now we're on the bed in my room
And I'm about to fill his shoes
But you say no
You say no
Does he take care of you?
Or could I easily fill his shoes?
But you say no
You say no

Now we're just outside of town
And you're making your way down
She's got a boyfriend anyway
She's got a boyfriend anyway

And I'm not trying to stop you, love
If we're gonna do anything we might as well just fuck
She's got a boyfriend anyway
She's got a boyfriend anyway

You've got your tongue pierced anyway
You in your high tops any day
You in your skinny jeans anyway
You and your fit friends anyway
I'd take them all out any day
They've all got back combs anyway
You all got boyfriends anyway[Verse 1]
Call it a split cause you know that you will
You bite your friends like chocolate
You say, we go where nobody knows
Got guns hidden under our petticoats
No we're never gonna quit it
No we're never gonna quit it, no
Now we run, run away from the boys in the blue
And my car smells like chocolate
Hey now think about what to do
I think about what to say, I think about how to think
Pause it, play it, pause it play it, pause it

[Chorus]
Oh we go where nobody knows
With guns hidden under our petticoats
No we're never gonna quit it
No we're never gonna quit it, no
Yeah we're dressed in black from head to toe
We've got guns hidden under our petticoats
No we're never gonna quit it
No we're never gonna quit it, no

[Post-Chorus]
Now you're never gonna quit it
Now you're never gonna quit it
Now you're never gonna quit it
If you don't stop smoking it
That's what she said
She said we're dressed in black, head to toe
With guns hidden under our petticoats
No we're never gonna quit it
No we're never gonna quit it, no

[Verse 2]
Hey now we're building up speed as we're approaching the hill
Oh my hair smells like chocolate
Hey now you say you're gonna quit it
But you're never gonna quit it
Go get it, go get it
Got get it, go get it, go!
And play it cool

[Chorus]
Oh we go where nobody knows
With guns hidden under our petticoats
No we're never gonna quit it
No we're never gonna quit it, no
Yeah we're dressed in black from head to toe
We've got guns hidden under our petticoats
No we're never gonna quit it
No we're never gonna quit it, no

[Bridge]
Well I think we better go, seriously better go
Said the feds are here you know
Seriously better go
Oh oh, well I think we better go
Said the feds are here you know
Said Rebecca better know
Seriously better go

[Chorus]
Oh we go where nobody knows
With guns hidden under our petticoats
No we're never gonna quit it
No we're never gonna quit it, no
Yeah we're dressed in black from head to toe
We've got guns hidden under our petticoats
No we're never gonna quit it
No we're never gonna quit it, no

[Bridge]
Well I think we better go, seriously better go
Said the feds are here you know
Seriously better go
Oh oh, well I think we better go
Said the feds are here you know
Said Rebecca better know
Seriously better go[Verse 1]
Irony is okay, I suppose
Culture is to blame
You try and mask your pain in the most postmodern way
You lack substance when you say something like, "Oh, what a shame"
It's just a self-referential way that stops you having to be human
I'm assuming you'll balloon when you remove the dirty spoon and start consuming like a human, that's what I am assuming

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm sure that you're not just another girl
I'm sure that you're gonna say that I was sexist
I feel like you're running out of all the things I liked you for

[Chorus]
Why can't we be friends, when we are lovers?
Because it always ends with us hating each other
Instead of calling me out, you should be pulling me in
I've just got one more thing to say

[Verse 2]
And why would you believe you could control how you're perceived
When at your best you're intermediately versed in your own feelings?
Keep on putting off conceiving
It's only you that you're deceiving
Oh, don't have a child, don't cramp your style, I'll leave it

[Chorus]
Why can't we be friends, when we are lovers?
Because it always ends with us hating each other
Instead of calling me out, you should be pulling me in
I've just got one more thing to say

[Outro]
I'm just pissed off because you pied me off
After your show when you let go of my hand
In front of some sket who wanted bit on your
Nah, Im just messing[Verse 1]
Bite your face to spite your nose
Seventeen and a half years old
Worrying about my brother finding out
Where's the fun in doing what you're told?

[Pre-Chorus]
I said "No!"
"Oh give it a rest, I could persuade you
I'm not your typical, stoned eighteen year old
Give me a night, I'll make you"
"I know you're looking for salvation in the secular age
But girl I'm not your savior"
Wrestle to the ground
God help me now because

[Chorus]
They're just girls breaking hearts
Eyes bright, uptight, just girls
But she can't be what you need if she's seventeen
They're just girls
They're just girls

[Verse 2]
A pair of frozen hands to hold
Oh she's so southern so she feels the cold
One moment I was tearing off your blouse
Now you're living in my house
What happened to just messing around?

[Pre-Chorus]
I said "Yo, I think you better go, I can't take you
You just sit and get stoned with thirty-year-olds and you think you've made it
Well, shouldn't you be fucking with somebody your age instead of making changes?"
Wrestle to the ground
God help me now because

[Chorus]
They're just girls breaking hearts
Eyes bright, uptight, just girls
But she can't be what you need if she's seventeen
They're just girls
They're just girls

[Bridge]
I told her from the start
Destined to be hard
I told her from the start
I'll break your heart
Destined to be hard
Break your heart

[Pre-Chorus]
I said "Yo, I think you better go, I can't take you
I know you're looking for salvation in the secular age, but girl I'm not your savior
Well, shouldn't you be fucking with somebody your age instead of making changes?"
Wrestle to the ground
God help me now because

[Chorus]
They're just girls breaking hearts
Eyes bright, uptight, just girls
But she can't be what you need if she's seventeen
They're just girls
They're just girls
They're just girls breaking hearts
Eyes bright, uptight, just girls
But she can't be what you need if she's seventeen
They're just girls
They're just girls

Because they're just girls...Are we awake?
Am I too old to be this stoned?
Was it your breasts from the start?
They played a part

For goodness sake
I wasn't told you'd be this cold
Now it's my time to depart
And I just had a change of heart

I'll quote "on the road" like a twat
And wind my way out of the city
Finding a girl who is equally pretty won't be hard
Oh, I just had a change of heart

[Instrumental Interlude]

You smashed a glass into pieces
That's around the time I left
And you were coming across as clever
Then you lit the wrong end of your cigarette

You said I'm full of diseases
Your eyes were full of regret
And then you took a picture of your salad
And put it on the Internet

And she said, "I've been so worried about you lately
You look shit and you smell a bit
You're mad thinking you could ever save me
Not looking like that"

You used to have a face straight out of a magazine
Now you just look like anyone
I just had a change of heart

I feel as though I was deceived
I never found love in the city
I just sat in self-pity and cried in the car
Oh I just had a change of heart

Then she said, "I've been so worried 'bout you lately
You were fit but you're losing it
You played a part, 'this is how it starts'"
Oh, I just had a change of heart

I just had a change of heart
I just had a change of heart
I just had a change of heart
Oh, I just had a change of heart
I just had a change of heart
I just had a change of heart
I just had a change of heart
I just had a change of heart[Chorus]
Yeah, you should be loving someone
Oh, oh, loving someone
Yeah, you should be loving someone
Oh, oh, loving someone
Yeah, you should be...

[Verse 1]
My heart is telling me the telly isn't telling me anything
I need but it needs to keep selling me
Besides celebrities lacking in integrity
Holding up the status quo instead of showing the kids
That they matter, who are they gonna batter next?
Just keep holding their necks and keep selling them sex
Its better if we keep them perplexed
It's better if we make them want the opposite sex
Disenfranchised young criminal minds in a car park beside where your nan resides are not slow, theyve just never been shown that you should be

[Chorus]
...loving someone
Oh, oh, loving someone
Yeah, you should be loving someone
Oh, oh, loving someone
Oh, oh...

[Verse 2]
We're all human, we're just like you, man
Were sentient or something or other I cant remember, whatever
We shouldn't have people afloat
If it was safer on the ground, we wouldn't be on a boat
Charlatan telepathy exploiting insecurity and praying on the purity
Of grief and its simplicity  but I know that maybe I'm too skeptical
Even Guy Debord needed spectacles, you see
I'm the Greek economy of cashing intellectual cheques
And I'm trying to progress, but instead of selling sex...
And I think I should be...

[Chorus]
...loving someone
Oh, oh, loving someone
Yeah, you should be loving someone
Oh, oh, loving someone
Yeah, you should be loving someone
Oh, oh, loving someone
Yeah, you should be loving someone
Oh, oh, loving someone
Yeah, you should be...

[Interlude: Spoken Word]
I am forever in alongside the boys in jumpers
On bikes from schools and cars
With autumn leaves fallen sparse across mid-afternoon
She blazed about how
Cultural language is an operating system
A simple interface rendered feeble and listless
When tested with divinity or a true understanding
Of the human condition
I never did understand  the duality of art and reality  living life and treating it as such but with a certain disconnect
To touch that cajoles at the artist with comfort and abandon, and between the spires and rolling roofs of the white city
That orange, English light cast only one, singular shadow
For you are not beside but within me

[Chorus]
...loving someone
Oh, oh, loving someone
Yeah, you should be loving someone
Oh, oh, loving someone
Yeah, you should be loving someone
Oh, oh, loving someone
Yeah, you should be loving someone
Oh, oh, loving someone
Yeah, you should be loving someone
Oh, oh, loving someone
Oh, oh...[Pre-Chorus]
You wet my eyes
But I don't mind it
I tell you lies
But it's only sometimes
You pick a fight
And I'll define it

[Chorus]
I swear that I (Swear that I)
I only called her one time
Maybe it was two times?
I don't think it was three times
It can't be more than four times
I think we need to rewind
You text that boy sometimes
Must be more than three times
I didn't mean to two-time, two-time you

[Verse]
She said that I should have liked it
I told her "I only use it sometimes"
Except when I need reminding
I'm petrified

[Chorus]
But I only called her one time
Maybe it was two times?
I don't think it was three times
I didn't mean to two-time, two-time you

[Pre-Chorus]
You wet my eyes
But I don't mind it
I tell you lies
But it's only sometimes
You pick a fight
And I'll define it

[Chorus]
I swear that
I only called her one time
Maybe it was two times?
I don't think it was three times
It can't be more than four times
I think we need to rewind
You text that boy sometimes
Must be more than three times
I didn't mean to two-time you, two-time you
To two-time, two-time you

[Chorus]
I only called her one time
Maybe it was two times?
I don't think it was three times
It can't be more than four times
I think we need to rewind
You text that boy sometimes
Must be more than three times
I didn't mean to two-time, two-time you

[Outro]
(One time, oh, one time, three time, four time
Three time, four time, two time, three time)
Two-time, two-time you
(One time, oh, one time, three time, four time
Three time, four time, two time, three time)[Verse 1]
Danny ran into some complications
He falls asleep during conversations
He's gotta search the street when he's on vacation
The worst thing is that I'm in the same situation

[Chorus]
And all I do is sit and think about you
If I knew what you'd do
Collapse my veins, wearing beautiful shoes
It's not living if it's not with you

[Verse 2]
And Danny says we're living in a simulation
But he works in a petrol station (Selling petrol)
He says it all began with his operation
And I know you think you're sly but you need some imagination

[Chorus]
And all I do is sit and think about you
If I knew what you'd do
Collapse my veins, wearing beautiful shoes
It's not living if it's not with you
All I do is sit and drink without you
If I choose then I lose
Distract my brain from the terrible news
It's not living if it's not with you

[Bridge]
I can't stop sweating or control my feet
Got a 20-stone monkey that I just can't beat
I can stage a situation, but I just can't eat
And there's a feeling, you're replacing embrace

[Chorus]
It's true that all I do is sit and think about you
If I knew what you'd do
Collapse my veins, wearing beautiful shoes
It's not living if it's not with you
All I do is sit and drink without you
If I choose then I lose
Distract my brain from the terrible news
It's not living if it's not with you

[Outro]
Oh, I'll try to get a job in a bank, I think
Danny spent the time trying to pack in the drinks for me
I feel sick and I know I that I'll lose but
It's not living if it's not with you
(It's not, it's not)
It's not living if it's not with you
(It's not, it's not)
(It's not, it's not)
It's not living if it's not with you
(It's not living if it's not with you)
(It's not, it's not)
(It's not, it's not)
(It's not, it's not)
(It's not living if it's not with you)[Verse 1]
You learn a couple things when you get to my age
Like friends don't lie and it all tastes the same in the dark
When your vinyl and your coffee collection is a sign of the times
You're getting spiritually enlightened at 29

[Chorus]
So just give yourself a try
Won't you give yourself a try?
Won't you give yourself a try?
Won't you give?

[Verse 2]
I found a grey hair in one of my zoots
Like context in a modern debate, I just took it out
The only apparatus required for happiness is your pain and fucking going outside
And getting STDs at 27 really isn't the vibe
Jane took her own life at 16
She was a kid who had the box tattooed on her arm
And I was 25 and afraid to go outside
A millennial that baby-boomers like

[Chorus]
Won't you give yourself a try?
Won't you give yourself a try?
Won't you give yourself a try?
Won't you give?

[Verse 3]
And what would you say to your younger self?
Growing a beard's quite hard
And whiskey never starts to taste nice
And you'll make a lot of money, and it's funny
'Cause you'll move somewhere sunny and get addicted to drugs
And spend obscene amounts on fucking seeds and beans online

[Chorus]
So just give yourself a try
Won't you give yourself a try?
Won't you give yourself a try?
Won't you give?[Verse 1]
Ive got a God-shaped hole thats infected
And Im petrified of being alone now
It's pathetic, I know

[Pre-Chorus]
And I tossed and I turn in my bed
It's just like I Lostmyhead (Lostmyhead)

[Chorus]
And if I believe You
Will that make it stop?
If I told You I need You
Is that what You want?
And I'm broken and bleeding
And begging for help
(There's no use singing a song)
And I'm asking You Jesus, show Yourself

[Verse 2]
I thought Id met You once or twice
But that was just because the dabs were nice and opening up my mind
Showing me consciousness is primary in the universe
And I had a revelation
I'll be Your child if You insist
I mean if it was You that made my body
You probably shouldn't have made me atheist
But, oh, Im a lesbian kiss
I'm an evangelist
And if you don't want to go to hell then Miss, you better start selling this

[Chorus]
And if I believe You
Will that make it stop?
If I told You I need You
Is that what You want?
And I'm broken and bleeding
And begging for help
(There's no use singing a song)
And I'm asking You Jesus, show Yourself

[Instrumental Break]

[Outro]
If I'm lost then how can I find myself?
If I'm lost then how can I find myself?
If I'm lost then how can I find myself?
If I'm lost now then how can I find myself?
If I'm lost now then how can I find myself?
If I'm lost then how can I find myself?
Then how can I find myself?
If I'm lost now then how can I find myself?
Yeah, yeah, yeah
If I'm lost now then how can I find myself?
Yeah, yeah[Intro]
Well I know when you're around 'cause I know the sound
I know the sound, of your heart
Well I know when you're around 'cause I know the sound
I know the sound, of your heart

[Chorus]
Well I know when you're around 'cause I know the sound
I know the sound, of your heart
Well I know when you're around 'cause I know the sound
I know the sound, of your heart

[Verse 1]
I can't believe I forgot your name
Oh baby won't you cum again?
She said "I've got a problem with your shoes
And your tunes, but I might move in
And I thought that you were straight, now I'm wondering"

[Pre-Chorus]
You're so conceited, I said "I love you"
What does it matter if I lie to you?
I don't regret it but I'm glad that we're through
So don't you tell me that you "Just don't get it"
'Cause I know you do

[Chorus]
And I know when you're around 'cause I know the sound
I know the sound, of your heart
Well I know when you're around 'cause I know the sound
I know the sound, of your heart

[Verse 2]
It's not about reciprocation, it's just all about me
A sycophantic, prophetic, Socratic junkie wannabe
And there's so much skin to see
A simple Epicurean philosophy
Oh, and you say (You say) I'm such a clich
I can't see the difference in it either way
And we left things to protect my mental health
But you'll call me when you're bored and you're playing with yourself

[Pre-Chorus]
You're so conceited, I said "I love you"
What does it matter if I lie to you?
I don't regret it but I'm glad that we're through
So don't you tell me that you just don't get it
'Cause I know you do

[Chorus]
I know when you're around 'cause I know the sound
I know the sound, of your heart
Well I know when you're around 'cause I know the sound
I know the sound, of your heart
Well I know when you're around 'cause I know the sound
I know the sound, of your heart
Well I know when you're around 'cause I know the sound
I know the sound, of your heart

[Outro]
Well I know when you're around 'cause I know the sound
I know the sound, of your heart
Well I know when you're around 'cause I know the sound
I know the sound, of your heart
Well I know when you're around 'cause I know the sound
I know the sound, of your heart
Well I know when you're around 'cause I know the sound
I know the sound, of your heart[Verse 1]
Hey, boy, stop pacing 'round the room
Using other people's faces as a mirror for you
I know your lungs need filling
Since your gums have lost their feeling
But don't say that you're giving it up again
"Do you have a card?
My irregular heart beat is starting to correct itself"
It's just a simple diarrhetic that prevents the empathetic
From being just and giving it up

[Chorus]
And you're the only thing that's going on in my mind
Taking over my life a second time
I don't have the capacity for fucking
You're meant to be helping me
When I said I liked it better without my money, I lied
It took a little while to recognize that I, I'm not giving it up again

[Verse 2]
This conversation's not about reciprocation no more
But I'm gon' wait until you finish so I can talk some more
About me and my things, my car, my living
And how I'm giving it up, giving it up again

[Chorus]
And you're the only thing that's going on in my mind
Taking over my life a second time
I don't have the capacity for fucking
You're meant to be helping me
When I said I liked it better without my money, I lied
It took a little while to recognize that I, I'm not giving it up again

[Bridge]
Oh, the kick won't last for long but the song only lasts 3 minutes
I think I've lost my phone so won't you call it up for me?
Oh the kick won't last for long but the song only lasts 3 minutes
And I know it's wrong but give me one

[Chorus]
And you're the only thing that's going on in my mind
Taking over my life a second time
I don't have the capacity for fucking
You're meant to be helping me
When I said I liked it better without my money, I lied
It took a little while to recognize that I, I'm not giving it up again

[Outro]
I'm not giving it up, I'm not giving it up
I'm not giving it up, I'm not giving it up
I'm not giving it up, giving it up
I'm not giving it up, giving it up![Verse 1]
A soft sound to the way she wears her hair down
Covering up her face
And oh, what a let down, I don't seem to be having any effect now
Falling all over the place

[Pre-Chorus 1]
And you're losing your words
We're speaking in bodies
Avoiding me and talking about you
And you're losing your turn
I guess I'll never learn
'Cause I stay another hour or two

[Chorus]
For crying out loud, settle down!
You know I can't be found with you
We get back to my house
Your hands, my mouth
Now I just stop myself around you

[Verse 2]
A small town dictating all the people we get around
What a familiar face
Do you get what I mean now?
I'm so fixated on the girl with the soft sound
And hair all over the place

[Pre-Chorus 2]
You're sure that I'd learn
I'm pushing through bodies
Avoiding me and walking around you
You're cold and I burn
I guess I'll never learn
'Cause I stay another hour or two

[Chorus]
For crying out loud, settle down
You know I can't be found with you
We get back to my house
Your hands, my mouth
Now I just stop myself around you
(Hey!)

[Instrumental Interlude]

[Verse 1]
A soft sound into the way she wears her hair down
Covering up her face
And oh, what a let down
I don't seem to be having any effect now
Falling all over the place

[Pre-Chorus 1]
And you're losing your words
We're speaking in bodies
Avoiding me and talking about you
And you're losing your turn
I guess I'll never learn
'Cause I stay another hour or two

[Chorus]
For crying out loud, settle down!
You know I can't be found with you
We get back to my house
Your hands, my mouth
Now I just stop myself around you
(For crying out loud!)[Verse 1]
I see her online
All the time
I'm trying not to stare down there
While she talks abouthertough time
Girl ofyour dreams
You know what I mean
There'ssomething 'bout her stare that makes you nervous
And you saythingsthatyou don't mean

[Pre-Chorus]
Well,I found ahotel, I called up the twins
It's seven in the morning, so they won't let me in
I need to get back, I've gotta see the girl on the screen
(And then I phoned her and she said)

[Chorus]
"Maybe I would like you better if you took off your clothes
I'm not playing with you, baby, I think that you should give it a go"
She said, "Maybe I would like you better if you took off your clothes
I wanna see and stop thinking, if you're too shy, then let me
Too shy, then let me know"

[Verse 2]
I've been wearing nothing every time I call you
And I'm starting to feel weird about it
Sometimes, it's better if you think about
This time, I think I'm gonna drink through it
But I see her online, and I don't think that I should be calling
All the time, I just wanted a happy ending
And I pretend I don't care about her stare
While she's giving me a tough time

[Pre-Chorus]
Well, I found a motel, it looked like the bins
I think there'd been a murder, so we couldn't get in
I need to get back, I've gotta see the girl on the screen

[Chorus]
"Maybe I would like you better if you took off your clothes
I'm not playing with you, baby, I think that you should give it a go"
She said, "Maybe I would like you better if you took off your clothes
I wanna see and stop thinking, if you're too shy, then let me
Too shy, then let me know (You're too shy, then let me)
Well, if you're too shy, then let me know (Too shy, then let me)
If you're too shy, then let me go" (Oh, yeah)

[Bridge]
I see her online
All the time

[Chorus]
Well, she said, "Maybe I would like you better if you took off your clothes
I'm not playing with you, baby, I think that you should give it a go"
She said, "Maybe I would like you better if you took off your clothes
I wanna see and stop thinking, if you're too shy, then let me
Too shy, then let me know"[Verse 1]
She said 'hello', she was letting me know
We share friends in Soho
She's a pain in the nose
And I'm a pain in women's clothes
"And you're a walking overdose in a great coat"
And so she wrote a plan for it on the back of a fag packet
She had to leave because she couldn't hack it
Not enough noise and too much racket
"I think I've spent all my money and your friends"

[Chorus]
Oh, how I'd love to go to Paris again
Oh, how I'd love to go to Paris again

[Verse 2]
Mr. Serotonin Man, lend me a gram
You call yourself a friend?
I got two left feet and I'm starting to cheat
On my girlfriend again
I caught her picking her nose
As the crowd cheered for an overdose
And I don't suppose you know where this train goes
There was a party that she had to miss
Because her friend kept cutting her wrists
Hyperpoliticized sexual trysts
"Oh, I think my boyfriend's a nihilist"
I said, "Hey kids, we're all just the same
What a shame"

[Chorus]
And oh, how I'd love to go to Paris again
And how I'd love to go to Paris again

[Verse 3]
"Oh, stop being an arsehole and counting my eye rolls"
"They're like piss holes in the snow" - uh oh
Keeping a tab on my health
Man you're putting me up on a shelf
"Well I'll believe you're clean
But only by seeing your face for myself"
And then she pointed at the bag of her dreams
In a well posh magazine
I said "I'm done, babe. I'm out of the scene"
But I was picking up on Bethnal Green
She said I've been romanticizing heroin

[Chorus]
And oh, how I'd love to go to Paris, to Paris again
And how I'd love to go to Paris again
And how I'd love to go to Paris again
And how I'd love to go to Paris again[Verse 1]
And be my mistake
Then turn out the light
She bought me those jeans
The ones you like
I don't want to hug
I just want to sleep
The smell of your hair
Reminds me of her feet

[Pre Chorus]
So, don't wait outside my hotel room
Just wait till I give you a sign
'Cause I get lonesome sometimes

[Chorus]
Save all the jokes you're going to make
Whilst I see how much drink I can take
Then be my mistake

[Verse 2]
I shouldn't have called
'Cause we shouldn't speak
You do make me hard
But she makes me weak

[Pre Chorus]
And don't wait outside my hotel room
Just wait till I give you a sign
'Cause I get lonesome sometimes

[Chorus]
And save all the jokes you're going to make
Whilst I see how much drink I can take
Then be my mistake[Verse 1]
Hey! Would you like to look outside sometimes? (No!)
I'm just with my friends online
And there's things we'd like to change!
(OH! Yeah)
Next thing you'll find you're reading about yourself on a plane, fame! What a shame! (Oh!)
Well, just keep looking, looking, looking, looking!

[Chorus]
And love me (Yeah)
If that's what you wanna do, oh (Yeah? No)
And love me (Yeah)
If that's what you wanna do, oh (Yeah? No)

[Verse 2]
You've been reading 'bout yourself on a plane, fame for a change
Caught up in fashion, Karcrashian panache
And a bag of bash for passion
You got a beautiful face but got nothing to say (Oh!)
"You look famous, let's be friends
And portray we possess something important
And do the things we'd like"
"We've just come to represent
A decline in the standards of what we accept!"
Yeah... Yeah... Yeah?! No!

[Chorus]
And love me (Yeah, oh)
If that's what you wanna do, oh (Yeah? No)
And love me (Love me, yeah)
If that's what you wanna do, oh (Yeah? No)

[Interlude]

[Bridge]
Oh so sack off your calendar, give it to the people!
Be the man that gets them up on their feet
Say "Oh, oh, oh, oh, ohhh"

[Chorus]
And love me (Yeah)
Oh (Yeah? No)
And love me (Yeah)
If that's what you wanna do (Oh, yeah)[Verse 1]
What time you coming out?
We started losing light
I'll never make it right
If you don't want me 'round
I'm so excited for the night
All we need's my bike and your enormous house
You said someday we might
When I'm closer to your height
'Til then, we'll knock around and see
If you're all I need

[Chorus]
Don't you see me? I
I think I'm falling, I'm falling for you
And don't you need me? I
I think I'm falling, I'm falling for you
On this night, and in this light
I think I'm falling (I think I'm falling), I'm falling for you
And maybe you, change your mind

[Verse 2]
I'm caught on your coat again
You said, "Oh no, it's fine"
I read between the lines and touched your leg again (again)
I'll take it one day at a time
Soon you will be mine, oh
But I want you now (I want you now)
When the smoke is in your eyes, you look so alive
Do you fancy sitting down with me? Maybe
'Cause you're all I need

[Bridge]
According to your heart
My place is not deliberate
Feeling of your arms
I don't want to be your friend
I want to kiss your neck

[Chorus]
Don't you see me? I
I think I'm falling, I'm falling for you
And don't you need me? I
I think I'm falling, I'm falling for you
On this night, and in this light
I think I'm falling (I think I'm falling), I'm falling for you
And maybe you, change your mind[Verse 1]
I got a plane in the middle of the night, don't you mind
I nearly killed somebody, don't you mind, don't you mind
I gave you something you can never give back, don't you mind
You've seen my face like a heart attack, don't you mind, don't you mind

[Verse 2]
I was late but I arrived
I'm sorry, but I'd rather be getting high than watching my family die
Exaggerate and you and I
Oh, I think I did something terrible to your body, don't you mind

[Hook]
I put your mother through hell, don't you mind
I hurt your brother as well, don't you mind, don't you mind
Oh, I was thinking 'bout killing myself, don't you mind
I love you, don't you mind, don't you mind

I put your mother through hell, don't you mind
I hurt your brother as well, don't you mind, don't you mind
Oh, I was thinking 'bout killing myself, don't you mind
I love you, don't you mind, don't you mind[Verse 1]
Big town
Synthetic apparitions of not being lonely
"Look! He's having a breakdown
Oh, what a letdown, a shame, I think he might die!"
And now she's dancing enthralling, I guess I gotta wait my turn
I said, "Don't fall in love with the moment"
She said, "I've got a lot to learn"

[Pre-Chorus]
And you know I'm in love with this city
But the green is turning brown
And I just look pathetic now

[Chorus]
If she likes it 'cause we just don't eat
And we're so intelligent, she's American
If she says I've got to fix my teeth
Then she's so American (She's American)
And if she likes it 'cause we just don't eat
And we're socially relevant, she's American
If she says I've got to fix my teeth
Then she's so American (She's American)

[Verse 2]
She's inducing sleep to avoid pain
And I think she's got a gun divinely decreed and custom made
She calls on the phone like the old days, expecting the world
And don't fall in love with the moment
And think you're in love with the girl

[Pre-Chorus]
There's no more water in this city
But be careful or you'll drown
You think you've got it figured out

[Chorus]
If she likes it 'cause we just don't eat
And we're so intelligent, she's American
If she says I've got to fix my teeth
Then she's so American (She's American)
And if she likes it 'cause we just don't eat
And we're socially relevant, she's American
If she says I've got to fix my teeth
Then she's so American (She's American)

[Bridge]
Well, your face has got a hold on me
But your brain is proper weird
Are you feeling the same?
You just keep nodding at me, looking vacant

[Breakdown]
She likes it 'cause we just don't eat
And we're socially relevant
She's American (She's American)
She says I've got to fix my teeth
Then she's so American
She's American

[Chorus]
If she likes it 'cause we just don't eat
And we're so intelligent, she's American
If she says I've got to fix my teeth
Then she's so American (She's American)
If she likes it 'cause we just don't eat
And we're socially relevant, She's American
If she says I've got to fix my teeth
Then she's so American (She's American)[Verse 1]
I bet you thought your life would change
But you're sat on a train again
Your memories are sceneries for things you said
But never really meant
You build it to a high to say goodbye
Because you're not the same as them
But your death it won't happen to you
It happens to your family and your friends
I pretend

[Chorus]
And I always wanna die, sometimes
I always wanna die, sometimes

[Verse 2]
You win, you lose, you sing the blues
There's no point in buying concrete shoes
I'll refuse

[Chorus]
And I always wanna die, sometimes
I always wanna die, sometimes
I always wanna die

[Bridge]
Am I me through geography?
A face collapsed through entropy
I can hardly speak
And when I try it's nothing but a squeak
On the video
Living room for small
If you can't survive, just try

[Chorus]
And I always wanna die, sometimes
I always wanna die
Always wanna die
Always wanna die
Always wanna die
And I always wanna die
Always wanna die
Always wanna die, sometimes
Sometimes
Sometimes
Sometimes
I, sometimes, always wanna die
Always wanna die
Always wanna die
Always wanna die, sometimes[Verse 1]
I personify the adolescent on a phone
Speaking like Im bigger than my body
I personify that lack of freedom in your life
And I'm sure she'll be gone in a second

[Pre-Chorus]
Let me tell you 'bout this girl
I thought she'd rearrange my world
Takes a particular type of girl
To put my heart under arrest
So why's this beating on my chest?

[Chorus]
(This must be my dream)
Wide awake before I found you
(This must be my dream)
I can't wait for you boy
(Wake me from my dream)
What does all our love amount to?
(This must be my dream)
We can't make love when you fly around me baby

[Verse 2]
Pipe down, you're no lover
It's failing cos' you want it to
Well, I thought it was love but I guess I must be dreaming
'Bout feeling something instead of you

[Pre-Chorus]
"What did I tell you 'bout this girl?"
The one to rearrange your world?
You got excited and now you find out that your 'girl' won't even get you undressed or care about your beating chest

[Chorus ]
(This must be my dream)
Wide awake before I found you
(This must be my dream)
I can't wait for you boy
(Wake me from my dream)
What does all our love amount to?
(This must be my dream)
We can't make love when you fly around me baby
(This must be my dream)
Wide awake before I found you
(This must be my dream)
I can't wait for you boy
(Wake me from my dream)
What does all our love amount to?
(This must be my dream)
We can't make love when you fly around me baby


[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus Variation]
(This must be my dream)
Wide awake before I found you
(This must be my dream)
I can't wait for you boy
(Wake me from my dream)
What does all our love amount to?
(This must be my dream)
We can't make love when you fly around me baby

[Chorus]
(This must be my dream)
Wide awake before I found you
(This must be my dream)
I can't wait for you boy
(Wake me from my dream)
What does all our love amount to?
(This must be my dream)
We can't make love when you fly around me baby[Verse 1]
I can't remember when we met
Because she didn't have a top on (Top on)
I improvisedalittle bit
She saidmy references were spot on (Spoton)
"Can I take you for a drink?"
She said, "Oh God, I'll have to think
Because we're mates, it doesn't feel right" (Feel right)
And I said, "It's cool," and "I was messing" but it's true
Yeah, it's you, you're the one that makes me feel right

[Chorus]
I've been in love with her for ages
And I can't seem to get it right
I fell in love with her in stages
My whole life

[Verse 2]
I had a dream where we had kids
You would cook, Id do the nappies (Nappies)
We went to Winter Wonderland
And it was shit but we were happy (Happy)
I'm sorry that I'm kinda queer, it's not as weird as it appears
It's 'cause my body doesn't stop me (Stop me)
Oh, it's okay, lots of people think I'm gay
But we're friends, so it's cool, why would it not be? (Not be)

[Chorus]
I've been in love with her for ages
And I can't seem to get it right
I fell in love with her in stages
My whole life

[Bridge]
And there's been no way for me to say
That I felt a certain way in stages, oh
I think the story needs more pages, yes

[Outro]
I've been in love with her for ages (Ages)
And ages, I've been in love with her for ages (Ages)
And ages, I've been in love with her for ages
Ages, and ages, I've been in love with her for ages
Ages, ages, and ages, I've been in love with her for ages
Ages, ages, and ages (Yeah), I've been in love with you for ages
And ages, and ages (I've been in love, yeah)
I've been in love with you for ages
Ages, I've been in love with you for ages[Instrumental]

"Well I only brought 3, what you lookin' at me for?"
She's dressed in white and putting off crying
"Well you're the best man, so what's the plan?
Why don't you talk to Matty about it?"
I said, "I only brought 3 like I told you before
We're gonna have to ask about."

Free bar, that's the point
Spilling Amaretto 'cause of previous joints
I'm sitting with a girl, fortunate placing
Preceding railing racket off a porcelain basin
Who's he? Giving it the lips?
I've never seen him knockin' about
He looks just like me, but 6 foot 3
So I reckon you could knock him out

"Well, I think I'll say a couple of words if you don't mind...
I never really got on with your bird the first time I met her out
Dressed in nowt, telling everybody you were shagging about"
Well, who's this? Going for the kiss
I'm probably gonna yosh in your mouth
Because it's 5 past 3, I can hardly see and I'm on the verge of passing out[Verse 1]
Rushing in a small town
I forgot to call you
Running low on know how
This beat I made for 2

[Pre-Chorus 1]
'Cause I remember that I like you
No matter what I found
She said, "It's nice to have your friends round
We're watching the television with no sound"

[Chorus]
It's just you and I, tonight
Why don't you figure my heart out?
It's just you and I, tonight
Why don't you figure my heart out?

[Verse 2]
Push your lack of chest out
"Look at my hair"
Gotta love the way you love yourself
'Your obsession with rocks and brown
And fucking the whole town is a reflection on your mental health'

[Pre-Chorus 2]
'Cause I remember when I found you
Much younger than you are now
And once we started having friends round
You created a television of your mouth

[Chorus]
It's just you and I, tonight
Why don't you figure my heart out?
It's just you and I, tonight
Why don't you figure my heart out?

[Bridge]
You got something to say?
Why don't you speak it out loud, instead of living in your head?
It's always the same
Why don't you take your heart out, instead of living in your head?

[Chorus]
It's just you and I, tonight
Why don't you figure my heart out?
It's just you and I, tonight
Why don't you figure my heart out?[Verse 1]
And she lays down on her bedroom floor
The chemicals that make her love
Don't seem to be working anymore
She tries her best, but it hurts her chest
And even though her sun is gone
She'd like to love her child nevertheless

[Verse 2]
My hair is brown, she's scared to touch
And she just wants to feel something
And I don't think that's asking for too much
And when I go to sleep it's when she begins to weep

[Chorus]
She's appalled by not loving me at all
She wears a frown and dressing gown
When she lays down

[Verse 3]
We got a plane, oh to see my dad again
She prayed that we'd fall from the sky
Simply to alleviate the pain
Over water, hmm
Over terrain
The engines all go bust, we turned to dust
And I've no reason to complain, yeah
And in the end, she chose cocaine
But it couldn't fix her brain

[Chorus]
She's appalled
Oh, she doesn't love me at all
She wears a frown and dressing gown
When she lays down

[Spoken Outro]
That was it[Chorus]
Drink slow to feed the nose, you know he likes to get blown
Has he got enough money to spend?
Leave? No, he's to and from, he doesn't like it when the girls go
Has he got enough money to spend?

[Verse 1]
It's going off cos they're not gonna let him in
2 and a half, the boy is rushing out his skin
He's got his charm with the girls that are smoking
He takes her arm, jumps the bar and now he's in

[Chorus]
Drink slow to feed the nose, you know he likes to get blown
Has he got enough money to spend?
Leave? No, he's to and fro, he doesn't like it when the girls go
Has he got enough money to spend?

[Verse 2]
A broken half a glass has opened up his chin
He thinks he's hard, a powdered mouth that tastes of gin
He's just been barred for that blues he was smoking
And then he barks, 'It's my car I'm sleeping in'

[Bridge]
Tabs with unlimited O's
New clothes
Bloody nose
Powders and walking back home
Has he got enough weed?
No
Broken phone
Retching on the floor alone
I can't believe that we're talking about him

[Verse 3]
'I'm searching you mate, your jaw's all over the place'
Can't talk, quick slap in the face
Yes I threw a nut, but your friends a case
Why you singling him out, is it because of his race?
'Look, the dog won't bark if you don't lark about'

[Outro]
M-O-N-E-Y's me
M-O-N-E-Y
M-O-N-E-Y's me
M-O-N-E-Y
M-O-N-E 
M-O-N-E 
M-O-N-E-Y
M-O-N-E-Y's me
M-O-N-E-Y[Intro]
I'm scared of dying (Don't go)
Is that on fire?
Am I a liar? Ooh (I can't be quiet)
I'm scared of dying
No gun required, ooh
My skin is fire, it's so desired

[Verse 1]
Is that designer?
Is that on fire?
Am I a liar?
Oh, will this help me lay down?
My skin is fire, it's so desired
No gun required
Oh, will this help me lay down?

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm scared of dying, it's fine
Oh, what's a fiver?
Being young in the city
Belief and saying something

[Chorus]
Would you please listen?
Would you please listen?
We can see what's missing
When you bleed, say so we know
Being young in the city
Belief and saying something
Would you please listen?
Would you please listen?
We can see what's missing
When you bleed, say so we know
Council, being listed
Man I kinda miss it, hey

[Verse 2]
I'm a designer, unite pariahs
Am I a liar?
Oh, will this help me lay down?
Kids don't want rifles, they want Supreme
No gun required
Oh, will this help me lay down?

[Pre-Chorus]
We're scared of dying, it's fine
What's a fiver?
Being young in the city
Belief and saying something

[Chorus]
Would you please listen?
Would you please listen?
We can see what's missing
When you bleed, say so we know
Being young in the city
Belief and saying something

[Bridge]
Gone off designer
It's all on fire
And we're all liars
So won't you help me lay down
My skin is fire, it's so desired
No gun required
Oh, won't you help me lay down?

[Outro]
I'm scared of dying
It's fine
Oh, what's a fiver?
Being young in the city
Belief and saying something
And saying something
And saying something[Verse 1]
And I swear there's a ghost on this island
And his hands, all covered in blood
And my wife inquired of understanding
But of course, my dear, you can't
She said, "How can I relate to somebody who doesn't speak?
I feel like I'm just treading water"

[Chorus]
Is it the same for you?
Is it the same for you?

[Verse 2]
Well he comes and he goes, so capricious
And his work appears so rushed
Well I love the house that we live in
And I love you all too much

[Chorus]
Is it the same for you?
Is it the same for you?
Is it the same for you?
Is it the same for you?

Well the criminals and liars
Keep them in your cells as a privilege of mine
And I love the house that we live in
And I love you all too much

[Bridge]
The blood is on your tongue as well as your hands
The blood is on your tongue as well as your hands

[Break]
The blood is on your tongue as well as your hands
Archaic and content you just wash them off
The blood is on your tongue as well as your hands
Archaic and content you just wash them off
The blood is on your tongue as well as your hands
Archaic and content you just wash them off
The blood is on your tongue as well as your hands
Archaic and content you just wash them off
The blood is on your tongue as well as your hands
Archaic and content you just wash them off
The blood is on your tongue as well as your hands
Archaic and content you just wash them off[Verse 1]
And you're a liar
At least all of your friends are
And so am I
Just typically drowned in my car

It's my party
And I'll cry to the end
You must try harder
Than kissing all of my friends, you

[Chorus]
Yeah, it takes a bit more
Yeah, it takes a bit more than you
It takes a bit more
Yeah, it takes a bit more than you

[Verse 2]
And you're alive
At least as far as I can tell you are
And so am I
You beat me down and then we're back to my car

And it's so ironic
How it's only been a year
And it's not my fault
That I fucked everybody here

[Chorus]
Yeah, it takes a bit more
Yeah, it takes a bit more than you
It takes a bit more
Yeah, it takes a bit more than you

Yeah, it takes a bit more
Yeah, it takes a bit more than you
It takes a bit more
Yeah, it takes a bit more than you

[Bridge]
And I say, do you wanna dance? Do you wanna dance?
Do you wanna dance in the bar at the back of the hall?
And I say, do you wanna dance? Do you wanna dance?
Do you wanna dance, dance in the back of the hall?

[Chorus]
Yeah, it takes a bit more
Yeah, it takes a bit more than you
It takes a bit more
Yeah, it takes a bit more than you

It takes a bit more
Yeah, it takes a bit more than you
It takes a bit more
Yeah, it takes a bit more than you

More, more, more
(Yeah, it takes a bit more)
(Yeah, it takes a bit more)
It takes a bit more
(Yeah, it takes a bit more)
(Yeah, it takes a bit more)
It takes a bit more

[Milk]

[Verse 1]
Straight lines, they unwind you
She does a little thing with her eyes that says, "We're off soon"
She says the bleeding's incidental 'cause she's so cool
She says, "I'm no fun if I've only a bottle of wine"

[Chorus]
And now she's doing it all the time
Yeah, she's doing it all the time

[Verse 2]
Slow down, yeah I want you
She does a little bit on the sly that shows what she's up to
She started talking about missing him, she was glistening
It won't mend your heart if it's only a couple of lines

[Chorus]
And now she's doing it all the time
Yeah, she's doing it all the time
Yeah, she's doing it all the time
Yeah, she's doing it all the time
Yeah, she's doing it all the timeI wish you'd walk in again
Imagine if you just did
I'd fill you in on the things you missed
Oh, sleepless Knights, a grown up man dressed in white
Who I thought might just save your life
But he couldn't, so you died

I don't like it, now you're dead
It's not the same when I scratch my own head
I haven't got the nails for it
And I know that God doesn't exist
And all the palaver surrounding it
But I like to think you hear me sometimes

So I reached for a borrowed fleece
From my dad or from Denise
Always trying to keep warm, when you're the sun

I sat with you beside your bed and cried
For things that I wish I'd said
You still had your nails red
And if I live past 72, I hope I'm half as cool as you

I got my pen and thought that I'd write
A melody and line for you tonight
I think that's how I make things feel alright

Made in my room, this simple tune
Will always keep me close to you
The crowds will sing their voices ring
And it's like you never left

But I'm bereft you see
I think you can tell
I haven't been doing too well[Verse 1]
Don't call it a fight when you know it's a war
With nothing but your t-shirt on
And go sit on the bed because I know that you want to
You've got pretty eyes, but I know you're wrong

[Verse 2]
And don't call it a spade if it isn't a spade
And go lie on the floor if you want
The first bit of advice that you gave me that I liked was they're too strong, too strong
Get in the shower if it all goes wrong

[Chorus]
Yeah, you wanna find love then you know where the city is
Yeah, you wanna find love then you know where the city is
Yeah, you wanna find love then you know where the city is, city is
Yeah, you wanna find love then you know where the city is

[Verse 3]
Yeah, counting cards was the best job he ever had
Cleaning up
He got good with his 4's and his 2's
Community service was the best job he ever had
Cleaning up
He got sick on the floor and his shoes

[Bridge]
Oh, and she said, "It's your birthday, are you feeling alright?"
The next one's the MD
You'll be feeling just fine
Your brother is just sat there
And you said that you felt snide
You hope that that boy will be alright

[Chorus]
Yeah, you wanna find love then you know where the city is
Yeah, you wanna find love then you know where the city is
Yeah, you wanna find love then you know where the city is, city is
Yeah, you wanna find love then you know where the city is

[Bridge]
Oh, and she said, "It's your birthday, are you feeling alright?"
The next one's the MD
You'll be feeling just fine
Your brother is just sat there
And you said that you felt snide
You hope that that boy will be alright

[Chorus]
Yeah, you wanna find love then you know where the city is
Yeah, you wanna find love then you know where the city is
Yeah, you wanna find love then you know where the city is, city is
Yeah, you wanna find love then you know where the city is[Verse 1]
With a face from a movie scene
Or magazine, you know what I mean
She's definitely got the style on you
She's definitely got the style on you

[Pre-Chorus 1]
She's got two-tone everything
Moving but she just can't move
She's got two phones, everything
Moving but she just can't move

[Chorus]
Because she way out
I've never seen her dance moves
Dancing like she way out
She way out, I've never seen her talk
But I'm telling you she way out

[Verse 2]
She said "It's not about your body
It's just social implications are brought upon by this party that we're sitting in
And I'd like to say you've changed but you're always the same
I've got a feeling that the marijuana's rotting your brain"

[Pre-Chorus 2]
She's got two-tone everything, way too intelligent
Moving but she just can't move
She's got two phones, everything
Boyfriend, telling him, "Find me 'cause I'll never find you"

[Chorus]
Because she way out
I've never seen her dance moves
Dancing like she way out
She way out, I've never seen her talk
But I'm telling you she way out
Because she way out
I've never seen her dance moves
Dancing like she way out
She way out, I've never seen her talk
But I'm telling you she way out

[Bridge]
The tension's overflowing with every Benson she's throwing
On the floor and in my mouth
She said "I'd love you to stay but that's simply insane
I've got a feeling that my friends are gonna kick in your brain"
Because

[Chorus]
Because she way out
I've never seen her dance moves
Dancing like she way out
She way out, I've never seen her talk
But I'm telling you she way out
Because she way out
I've never seen her dance moves
Dancing like she way out
She way out, I've never seen her talk
But I'm telling you she way out

She way out
She way out
She way out
She way out
She way out
I've never seen her dance moves
Dancing like she way out
She way out, I've never seen her talk
But I'm telling you she way out
She way out[Verse 1]
Wake up, wake up, wake up
It's Monday morning and we've only got a thousand of them left
Well, I know it feels pointless and you don't have any money
But we're all just gonna try our fucking best
Well, my generation wanna fuck Barack Obama
Living in a sauna with legal marijuana

[Pre-Chorus]
Well, girls, food, gear
I don't like going outside, so bring me everything here
(Yeah, woo, yeah, that's right)

[Chorus]
People like people
They want alive people
The young surprise people
Stop fucking with the, fucking with the
People like people
They want alive people
The young surprise people
Stop fucking with the, fucking with the
People like people
They want alive people
The young surprise people
Stop fucking with the, fucking with the
People like people
They want alive people
The young surprise people
Stop fucking with the kids

[Verse 2]
Wake up, wake up, wake up
We are appalling and we need to stop just watching shit in bed
And I know it sounds boring and we like things that are funny
But we need to get this in our fucking heads
The economy's a goner, republic's a banana, ignore it if you wanna

[Pre-Chorus]
Fuck it, I'm just gonna get girls, food, gear
I don't like going outside, so bring me everything here
(Yeah, woo, yeah)

[Chorus]
People like people
They want alive people
The young surprise people
Stop fucking with the, fucking with the
People like people
They want alive people
The young surprise people
Stop fucking with the, fucking with the
People like people
They want alive people
The young surprise people
Stop fucking with the kids
People like people
They want alive people
The young surprise people
Stop fucking with the kids

[Chorus]
People like people
They want alive people
The young surprise people
Stop fucking with the, fucking with the
People like people
They want alive people
The young surprise people
Stop fucking with the, fucking with the
People like people
They want alive people
The young surprise people
Stop fucking with the kids[Verse 1]
And well, I think I've gone mad
Isn't that so sad?
And what a shame you've lost a brain that you never had
Oh mum check the car it cant have gone far
I must have left it on a train or lost in a bar
Its likely in a Sainsburys
Flirting with the girls and waiting for me
I jumped on a bus, declared my name
And asked if anybody's seen my brain
Your brain was last seen going for a run
"And would you sign an autograph for my daughter Laura?
Cause she adores you
But I think youre shit"
"Ive gotta look for my brain for a bit!
I stepped outside, it hurt my eyes
Well what do you expect when youve got no mind!
I searched all day it drove me insane
Where would I be if I was my brain?

[Instrumental]

[Outro]
The nice nurse told me she felt my pain
But she couldn't find a single trace of my brain
"Oops I did it again" started playing
Forget my brain, remember my name[Verse 1]
Hello, there's a place I've been going
There's a place I've been going
Now I'm clean, it would seem
Let's go somewhere I'll be seen
As sad as it seems
I seen Greg and he was like
"I seen your friends at the birthday party
They were kinda fucked up before it even started
They were gonna go to the Pinegrove show
They didn't know about all the weird stuff
So they just left it" (So they just left it)
I was wasted (I was wasted)
And cold, minding my business

[Verse 2]
Then I seen the girls and they were all like
"Do you wanna come and get fucked up?"
Listen, I got myself a missus, so there can't be any kissing
"No, don't be a fridge, you better wise up, kid
It's all Adderall now, it doesn't make you wanna do it"

[Verse 3]
"This ain't going well", I thought that I was stuck in Hell
In a boring conversation with a girl called Mel
About her friend in Cincinnati called Matty as well
You pulled away when I went in for the kiss
No, it wasn't a diss
You put the tap on to cover up the sound of your piss
After four years, don't you think I'm over all this?
"That's rich from a man who can't shit in a hotel room
He's gotta share for a bit"
You make a little hobby out of going to the lobby
To get things that they don't have

[Verse 4]
Does it go through ya when I'm talking to ya?
You know that I could sue ya if we're married
And you fuck up again
Impress myself with stealth and bad health
And my wealth and progressive causes
Drink your kombucha and buy an Ed Ruscha
Surely, it's a print 'cause I'm not made of it
Look, the fucking state of it
I came pretty late to it
We can still be mates 'cause it's only a picture

[Outro]
All your friends in one place
Oh, we're a scene, whatever that means
I depend on my friends to stay clean
As sad as it seems
As sad as it seems
As sad as it seems[Verse 1]
At the best of times I'm lonely in my mind
But I can find something to show you
If you have got the time
Why would I rely on the things that I did right?
She said, "I gave you four years of my life"

[Chorus]
So, what about these feelings I've got?
We got it wrong and you said you'd had enough
What about these feelings I've got?
I couldn't be more in love

[Verse 2]
I could have been a great line
I could have been a sign
Or overstay my time
Say what's on your mind
Maybe I'll rely on all the things that made it right
Because I'd give you all the years of my life

[Chorus]
So, what about these feelings I've got?
We got it wrong and you said you'd had enough
But what about these feelings I've got?
I couldn't be more in love

[Instrumental]

[Chorus]
And what about these feelings I've got?
We got it wrong and you said you'd had enough
But what about these feelings I've got?
I couldn't be more in love[Verse 1]
Is it getting better
Or do you feel the same?
Will it make it easier on you, now
You got someone to blame?

[Chorus 1]
You say one love, one life
When it's one need in the night
One love, we get to share it
Leaves you, baby, if you don't care for it

[Verse 2]
Did I disappoint you
Or leave a bad taste in your mouth?
You act like you never had love
And you want me to go without

[Chorus 2]
Well, it's too late tonight
To drag the past out into the light
We're one, but we're not the same
We get to carry each other, carry each other
One

[Verse 3]
Have you come here for forgiveness?
Have you come to raise the dead?
Have you come here to play Jesus
To the lepers in your head?

[Chorus 3]
Did I ask too much? More than a lot
You gave me nothing, now it's all I got
We're one, but we're not the same
Well, we hurt each other, then we do it again

[Bridge]
You say love is a temple, love a higher law
Love is a temple, love the higher law
You ask me to enter, but then you make me crawl
And I can't be holding on to what you got
When all you got is hurt

[Chorus 4]
One love, one blood
One life, you got to do what you should
One life with each other
Sisters, brothers
One life, but we're not the same
We get to carry each other, carry each other
One
One

[Outro]
Ooh-ooh-ooh
Oh-ooh
May we, may we, may we get
Higher
Oh, higher
(Ay, yeah, go) higher
(Oh) Higher[Verse 1]
See the stone set in your eyes
See the thorn twist in your side
I'll wait for you
Sleight of hand and twist of fate
On a bed of nails she makes me wait
And I wait without you

[Chorus]
With or without you
With or without you

[Verse 2]
Through the storm, we reach the shore
You give it all but I want more
And I'm waiting for you

[Chorus]
With or without you
With or without you, ah-ah
I can't live with or without you

[Bridge]
And you give yourself away
And you give yourself away
And you give, and you give
And you give yourself away

[Verse 3]
My hands are tied, my body bruised
She got me with nothing to win
And nothing left to lose

[Bridge]
And you give yourself away
And you give yourself away
And you give, and you give
And you give yourself away

[Chorus]
With or without you
With or without you, ohh
I can't live with or without you

[Outro-Chorus]
With or without you
With or without you, ohh
I can't live with or without you
With or without you[Verse 1]
I have climbed the highest mountains
I have run through the fields
Only to be with you
Only to be with you
I have run, I have crawled
I have scaled these city walls
These city walls
Only to be with you

[Chorus]
But I still haven't found what I'm looking for
But I still haven't found what I'm looking for

[Verse 2]
I have kissed honey lips
Felt the healing in her finger tips
It burned like fire
This burning desire
I have spoke with the tongue of angels
I have held the hand of a devil
It was warm in the night
I was cold as a stone

[Chorus]
But I still haven't found what I'm looking for
But I still haven't found what I'm looking for

[Verse 3]
I believe in the Kingdom Come
Then all the colours will bleed into one
Bleed into one
But yes, I'm still running
You broke the bonds
And you loosed the chains
Carried the cross of my shame
Oh my shame, you know I believe it

[Chorus]
But I still haven't found what I'm looking for
But I still haven't found what I'm looking for
But I still haven't found what I'm looking for
But I still haven't found what I'm looking for[Instrumental Intro]

[Verse 1]
I can't believe the news today
Oh, I can't close my eyes and make it go away
How long, how long must we sing this song?
How long? How long?
'Cause tonight, we can be as one
Tonight

[Pre-Chorus]
Broken bottles under children's feet
Bodies strewn across the dead end street
But I won't heed the battle call
It puts my back up
Puts my back up against the wall

[Chorus]
Sunday, Bloody Sunday
Sunday, Bloody Sunday
Sunday, Bloody Sunday
Sunday, Bloody Sunday
Alright, let's go!

[Verse 2]
And the battle's just begun
There's many lost, but tell me, who has won?
The trench is dug within our hearts
And mothers, children, brothers, sisters
Torn apart

[Chorus]
Sunday, Bloody Sunday
Sunday, Bloody Sunday

[Bridge]
How long
How long must we sing this song?
How long, how long?
'Cause tonight, we can be as one
Tonight

[Chorus]
Sunday, Bloody Sunday
Sunday, Bloody Sunday
Come get some!

[Bridge]
Wipe the tears from your eyes
Wipe your tears away
Oh, wipe your tears away
Oh, wipe your tears away
Oh, wipe your bloodshot eyes

[Chorus]
Sunday, Bloody Sunday
Sunday, Bloody Sunday

[Verse 3]
And it's true, we are immune
When fact is fiction and TV reality
And today, the millions cry
We eat and drink while tomorrow, they die
The real battle just begun
To claim the victory Jesus won
On

[Chorus]
Sunday, Bloody Sunday
Sunday, Bloody Sunday[Chorus: Bono]
Get out of your own way, hey, hey
Get out of your own way, hey, hey

[Verse 1: Bono]
Love hurts
Now you're the girl who's left with no words
Your heart's a balloon, but then it bursts
It doesn't take a cannon, just a pin
Your skin's not covering
And resistance
Love has got to fight for its existence
The enemy has armies of assistance
The amorous, the glamorous, the kiss
A fist, listen to this, oh

[Chorus: Bono]
Get out of your own way, oh, I
Get out of your own way, oh, I

[Post-Chorus: Bono]
I could sing it to you all night, all night
If I could, I'd make it alright, alright
Nothing's stopping you except what's inside
I can help you, but it's your fight, your fight

[Verse 2: Bono]
Fight back
Don't take it lyin' down, you got to bite back
The face of liberty's starting to crack
She had a plan up until she got smacked in the mouth
And it all went south
Like freedom
The slaves are lookin' for someone to lead them
The master's lookin' for someone to need him
The promised land is there for those who need it most
And Lincoln's ghost said...

[Chorus: Bono]
Get out of your own way, oh, I
Get out of your own way, oh, I

[Post-Chorus: Bono]
I could sing it to you all night, all night
If I could, I'd make it alright, alright
Nothing's stopping you except what's inside
I can help you, but it's your fight, your fight

[Chorus: Bono]
Get out of your own way
Get out of your own way

[Instrumental Bridge]

[Chorus: Bono]
Get out of your own way
Get out of your own way
Get out of your own way

[Outro: Kendrick Lamar]
Blessed are the arrogant
For there is the kingdom of their own company
Blessed are the superstars
For the magnificence in their light
We understand better our own insignificance
Blessed are the filthy rich
For you can only truly own what you give away
Like your pain[Verse 1]
One man come in the name of love
One man come and go
One man come he to justify
One man to overthrow

[Chorus]
In the name of love
What more in the name of love?
In the name of love
What more in the name of love?

[Verse 2]
One man caught on a barbed wire fence
One man he resist
One man washed up on an empty beach
One man betrayed with a kiss

[Chorus]
In the name of love
What more in the name of love?
In the name of love
What more in the name of love?

[Interlude]
Nothing like love
There's nothing like love
Nobody like you
There's nobody like you

[Verse 3]
Early morning, April 4
Shot rings out in the Memphis sky
Free at last, they took your life
They could not take your pride

[Chorus]
In the name of love
What more in the name of love?
In the name of love
What more in the name of love?

[Chorus]
In the name of love
What more in the name of love?
In the name of love
What more in the name of love?[Verse 1]
The heart is a bloom, shoots up through the stoney ground
There's no room, no space to rent in this town
You're out of luck, and the reason that you had to care
The traffic is stuck, and you're not moving anywhere
You thought you'd found a friend to take you out of this place
Someone you could lend a hand in return for grace

[Chorus]
It's a beautiful day
Sky falls, you feel like
It's a beautiful day
Don't let it get away

[Verse 2]
You're on the road, but you've got no destination
You're in the mud, in the maze of her imagination
You love this town even if that doesn't ring true
You've been all over, and it's been all over you

[Chorus]
It's a beautiful day
Don't let it get away
It's a beautiful day
Ooh-hoo-hoo

[Bridge]
Touch me
Take me to that other place
Teach me
I know I'm not a hopeless case

[Verse 3]
See the world in green and blue
See China right in front of you
See the canyons broken by cloud
See the tuna fleets clearing the sea out
See the Bedouin fires at night
See the oil fields at first light
And see the bird with a leaf in her mouth
After the flood all the colours came out

[Chorus]
It's a beautiful day
Don't let it get away
Beautiful day

[Bridge]
Touch me
Take me to that other place
Reach me
I know I'm not a hopeless case

[Verse 4]
What you don't have you don't need it now
What you don't know you can feel it somehow
What you don't have you don't need it now
Don't need it now
Was a beautiful day[Verse 1]
You got a face not spoiled by beauty
I have some scars from where I've been
You've got eyes that can see right through me
You're not afraid of anything they've seen

[Pre-Chorus 1]
I was told that I would feel
Nothing the first time
I don't know how these cuts heal
But in you I found a rhyme

[Chorus 1]
If there is a light you can't always see
And there is a world we can't always be
If there is a dark that we shouldn't doubt
And there is a light, don't let it go out

And this is a song, a song for someone
This is a song, a song for someone

[Verse 2]
You let me in to a conversation
A conversation only we could make
You're breaking into my imagination
Whatever's in there it's yours to take

[Pre-Chorus 2]
I was told I would feel
Nothing the first time
You were slow to heal
But this could be the night

[Chorus 2]
If there is a light you can't always see
And there is a world we can't always be
If there is a dark within and without
And there is a light, don't let it go out

And this is a song, a song for someone
This is a song, this is a song for someone

[Outro]
And I'm a long, long way from your hill of Calvary
And I'm a long way from where I was, where I need to be
If there is a light you can't always see
And there is a world we can't always be
If there is a kiss I stole from your mouth
And there is a light, don't let it go out[Verse 1]
Every breaking wave on the shore
Tells the next one there'll be one more
Every gambler knows that to lose
Is what you're really there for
Summer I was fearlessness
Now, I speak into an answer phone
Like every falling leaf on the breeze
Winter wouldn't leave it alone, alone

[Chorus]
If you go
If you go your way and I go mine
Are we so
Are we so helpless against the tide?
Baby, every dog on the street
Knows that we're in love with defeat
Are we ready to be swept off our feet
And stop chasing
Every breaking wave?

[Verse 2]
Every sailor knows that the sea
Is a friend made enemy
Every shipwrecked soul knows what it is
To live without intimacy
I thought I heard the captain's voice
It's hard to listen while you preach
Like every broken wave on the shore
This is as far as I could reach

[Chorus]
If you go
If you go your way and I go mine
Are we so
Are we so helpless against the tide?
Baby, every dog on the street
Knows that we're in love with defeat
Are we ready to be swept off our feet
And stop chasing
Every breaking wave?

[Bridge]
The sea knows where are the rocks
And drowning is no sin
You know where my heart is
The same place that yours has been
We know that we fear to win
And so we end before we begin
Before we begin

[Chorus]
If you go
If you go your way and I go mine
Are we so
Are we so helpless against the tide?
Baby, every dog on the street
Knows that we're in love with defeat
Are we ready to be swept off our feet
And stop chasing
Every breaking wave?[Verse 1: Bono]
When you look so good, the pain in your face doesn't show
When you look so good and baby, you don't even know
When the world is ours but the world is not your kind of thing
Full of shooting stars, brighter as they're vanishing
Oh you've seen enough to know it's children who teach
You're still free enough to wake up on a bed or a beach

[Chorus: Bono]
You're the best thing about me
The best thing that ever happened a boy
You're the best thing about me
I'm the kind of trouble that you enjoy
You're the best thing about me
The best things are easy to destroy
You're the best thing about me
The best thing about me

[Verse 2: Bono]
I been crying out, "How bad can a good time be?"
Shooting off my mouth, that's another great thing about me
I have everything but I feel like nothing at all
There's no risky thing for a man who's determined to fall

[Chorus: Bono]
You're the best thing about me
The best thing that ever happened a boy
You're the best thing about me
I'm the kind of trouble that you enjoy
You're the best thing about me
The best things are easy to destroy
You're the best thing about me

[Post-Chorus: Bono]
Why am I
Why am I walking away?
Walking away
Why am I walking away?

[Bridge: The Edge]
I can see it all so clearly
I can see what you can't see
I can see you love her loudly
When she needs you quietly

[Chorus: Bono]
You're the best thing about me
The best things are easy to destroy
You're the best thing about me

[Post-Chorus: Bono]
Why am I
Why am I walking away?
Walking away
Why am I walking away?[Verse 1]
I wanna run, I want to hide
I wanna tear down the walls
That hold me inside
I wanna reach out
And touch the flame
Where the streets have no name

[Verse 2]
I wanna feel sunlight on my face
I see the dust-cloud
Disappear without a trace
I wanna take shelter
From the poison rain
Where the streets have no name

[Chorus]
Where the streets have no name
Where the streets have no name
We're still building and burning down love
Burning down love
And when I go there
I go there with you
It's all I can do

[Verse 3]
The city's a flood, and our love turns to rust
We're beaten and blown by the wind
Trampled in dust
I'll show you a place
High on a desert plain
Where the streets have no name

[Chorus]
Where the streets have no name
Where the streets have no name
We're still building and burning down love
Burning down love
And when I go there
I go there with you
It's all I can do

[Outro]
Our love turns to rust
We're beaten and blown by the wind
Blown by the wind
Oh and I see love
See our love turn to rust
We're beaten and blown by the wind
Blown by the wind
Oh when I go there
I go there with you
It's all I can do[Chorus: Lykke Li]
Somebody stepped inside your soul
Somebody stepped inside your soul
Little by little, they robbed and stole
'Til someone else was in control

[Verse 1: Bono]
You think its easier
To put your finger on the trouble
When the trouble is you
And you think its easier
To know your own tricks
Well, its the hardest thing youll ever do

[Pre-Chorus: Bono & Lykke Li]
I have a will for survival
So you can hurt me and hurt me some more
I can live with denial
But youre not my troubles anymore

[Chorus: Lykke Li]
Somebody stepped inside your soul
Somebody stepped inside your soul
Little by little, they robbed and stole
'Til somebody else was in control
Somebody stepped inside your soul
Somebody stepped inside your soul
Little by little, they robbed and stole
'Til someone else was in control

[Verse 2: Bono]
You think its easier
To give up on the trouble
If the trouble is destroying you
And you think its easier
But before you threw me a rope
It was the one thing I could hold on to

[Pre-Chorus: Bono & Lykke Li]
I have a will for survival
So you can hurt me then, and hurt me some more
I can live with denial
But youre not my troubles anymore

[Chorus: Lykke Li & (Bono)]
Somebody stepped inside your soul
Somebody stepped inside your soul
Little by little, they robbed and stole
'Til somebody else was in control ('til someone else is in control)
Somebody stepped inside your soul (oh no)
Somebody stepped inside your soul (oh no)
Little by little, they robbed and stole
'Til somebody else was in control

[Bridge: Bono & Lykke Li]
God knows its not easy
I'm taking on the shape of someone elses pain
God, now you can see me
Im naked and Im not afraid, my bodys
Sacred and Im not ashamed

[Chorus: Lykke Li & (Bono)]
Somebody stepped inside your soul (oh no)
Somebody stepped inside your soul (oh no)
Little by little, they robbed and stole
'Til somebody else was in control ('til someone else is in control)
Somebody stepped inside your soul (oh no)
Somebody stepped inside your soul (oh no)
Little by little, they robbed and stole
'Til someone else was in control (someone else is in control)[Verse 1]
The sea wants to kiss the golden shore
The sunlight warms your skin
All the beauty that's been lost before
Wants to find us again

I can't fight you anymore
It's you I'm fighting for
The sea throws rocks together
But time leaves us polished stones

[Chorus]
We can't fall any further
If we can't feel ordinary love
And we cannot reach any higher
If we can't deal with ordinary love

[Verse 2]
Birds fly high in the summer sky
And rest on the breeze
The same wind will take care of you and I
We'll build our house in the trees

Your heart is on my sleeve
Did you put there with a magic marker
For years I would believe
That the world couldn't wash it away

[Chorus]
'Cause we can't fall any further
If we can't feel ordinary love
And we cannot reach any higher
If we can't deal with ordinary love

[Bridge]
Are we tough enough
For ordinary love

[Chorus]
We can't fall any further
If we can't feel ordinary love
And we cannot reach any higher
If we can't deal with ordinary love
We can't fall any further
If we can't feel ordinary love
And we cannot reach any higher
If we can't deal with ordinary love[Intro: Kendrick Lamar]
Blessed are the bullies
For one day they will have to stand up to themselves
Blessed are the liars
For the truth can be awkward

[Verse 1: Bono]
It's not a place
This country is to me a sound
Of drum and bass
You close your eyes to look around

[Bridge 1: Bono]
Look around, look around
Look around, it's a sound
Look around, look around
It's a sound

[Verse 2: Bono]
It's not a place
This country is to me a thought
That offers grace
For every welcome that is sought

[Chorus: Bono]
You are rock and roll
You and I are rock and roll
You are rock and roll
We came here looking for American soul

[Verse 3: Bono]
It's not a place
This is a dream the whole world owns
The pilgrim's face
It had your heart to call her home

[Refrain]
Hold on Brother John
Too many mothers weepin'
Dream on Brother John
But in your dreams you can't be sleepin'

[Chorus: Bono]
You are rock and roll
You and I are rock and roll
You are rock and roll
We came here looking for American soul
American
American

[Bridge 2: Bono]
Put your hands in the air
Hold up the sky
Could be too late, but we still gotta try
There's a moment in our life where a soul can die
And the person in a country when you believe the lie
The lie (the lie, the lie)
There's a promise in the heart of every good dream
It's a call to action, not to fantasy
The end of a dream, the start of what's real
Let it be unity
Let it be community
For refugees like you and me
A country to receive us
Will you be our sanctuary
Refu-Jesus

[Chorus: Bono]
You are rock and roll
You and I are rock and roll
You are rock and roll
Came here looking for American soul

[Chorus: Bono]
You are rock and roll
You and I are rock and roll
You are rock and roll
Came here looking for American soul
American soul
American soul[Verse 1]
I was chasing down the days of fear
Chasing down a dream before it disappeared
I was aching to be somewhere near
Your voice was all I heard
I was shaking from a storm in me
Haunted by the spectres that we had to see
Yeah, I wanted to be the melody
Above the noise, above the hurt

[Pre-Chorus]
I was young
Not dumb
Just wishing to be blinded
By you
Brand new
And we were pilgrims on our way

[Chorus 1]
I woke up at the moment when the miracle occurred
Heard a song that made some sense out of the world
Everything I ever lost, now has been returned
The most beautiful sound I'd ever heard

[Verse 2]
We got language so we can't communicate
Religion so I can love and hate
Music so I can exaggerate my pain
And give it a name

[Pre-Chorus]
I was young
Not dumb
Just wishing to be blinded
By you
Brand new
And we were pilgrims on our way

[Chorus 1]
I woke up at the moment when the miracle occurred
Heard a song that made some sense out of the world
Everything I ever lost, now has been returned
The most beautiful sound I'd ever heard

[Bridge]
We can hear you (hear you)
We can hear you
We can hear you (hear you, ooh)

[Chorus 2]
I woke up at the moment when the miracle had come
I get so many things I don't deserve
All the stolen voices will some day be returned
The most beautiful sound I'd ever heard

[Outro]
Your voices will be heard
Your voices will be heard[Intro]
Unos, dos, tres, catorce!
(Turn it up loud, captain)

[Verse 1]
Lights go down, it's dark, the jungle is your head
Can't rule your heart, a feeling so much stron-
-ger than a thought, your eyes are wide and though your soul
It can't be bought, your mind can wander

[Chorus]
Hello, hello! (Hola!)
I'm at a place called Vertigo (Dnde est?)
It's everything I wish I didn't know
Except you give me something
I can feel
Feel

[Verse 2]
The night is full of holes as bullets rip the sky
Of ink with gold, they twinkle as the boys
Play rock and roll, they know that they can't dance
At least they know
I can't stand the beats, I'm asking for the cheque
The girl with crimson nails has Jesus round her neck
Swinging to the music, swinging to the music
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

[Chorus]
Hello, hello! (Hola!)
I'm at a place called Vertigo (Dnde est?)
It's everything I wish I didn't know
That you give me something
I can feel
Feel

[Bridge 1]
Checkmated!
Just fun!
She made it in, yeah!

[Bridge 2]
All of this, all of this can be yours
All of this, all of this can be yours
All of this, all of this can be yours
Just give me what I want and no-one gets hurt

[Final Chorus]
Hello, hello! (Hola!)
We're at a place called Vertigo (Dnde est?)
Lights go down and all I know
Is that you give me something
I can feel your love teaching me how
Your love is teaching me how
How to kneel
Kneel

[Outro]
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah (yeah)
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah[Verse 1]
Morning, your toast, your tea and sugar
Read about the politician's lover
Go through the day like knife through butter
Why don't you
You dress in the colors of forgiveness
Your eyes as red as Christmas
Purple robes are folded on the kitchen chair

[Chorus]
You're gonna sleep like a baby tonight
In your dreams, everything is alright
Tomorrow dawns like someone else's suicide
You're gonna sleep like a  baby tonight

[Verse 2]
Dreams
It's a dirty business, dreaming
Where there is silence and not screaming
Where there's no daylight, there's no healing

[Chorus]
You're gonna sleep like a baby tonight
In your dreams, everything is alright
Tomorrow dawns like a suicide
But you're gonna sleep like a baby tonight

[Verse 3]
Hope, hope is where the door is
When the church is where the war is
Where no one can feel no one else's pain

[Chorus]
You're gonna sleep like a baby tonight
In your dreams, everything is alright
Tomorrow dawns like a suicide
But you're gonna sleep like a baby tonight
Sleep like a baby tonight
Like a bird, your dreams take flight
Like St. Francis covered in light
You're gonna sleep like a baby tonight[Verse 1]
The winter
Doesn't want you
It haunts you
Summer serenadings
A long way
From this frozen place
Your face
Our teacher
Our preacher
It's nature
And like flowers growing in a bomb crater
From nothing
A rose
It grows

[Chorus]
I've been thinking about the West Coast
Not the one that everyone knows
We're sick of living in the shadows
We have one more chance before the light goes
For a summer of love
A summer of love

[Verse 2]
We're freezing
We're leaving
Believing
That all we need is to head over somewhere
In a summer
To come
So we run

[Chorus]
I've been thinking about the West Coast
Not the one that everyone knows
We're sick of living in the shadows
We have one more chance before the light goes
For a summer of love
A summer of love

[Bridge]
Oh and when all is lost
When all is lost we find out what remains
Oh the same oceans crossed
For some its pleasure, for some its pain

[Chorus]
I've been thinking about the West Coast
Not the one that everyone knows
In the rubble of Aleppo
Flowers blooming in the shadows
For a summer of love
A summer of love[Intro]
Yeah...

[Verse 1]
All is quiet on New Year's Day
A world in white gets underway
I want to be with you
Be with you night and day
Nothing changes on New Year's Day
On New Year's Day

[Chorus]
I will be with you again
I will be with you again

[Verse 2]
Under a blood red sky
A crowd has gathered in black and white
Arms entwined, the chosen few
The newspapers says, says
Say it's true, it's true...
And we can break through
Though torn in two
We can be one

[Chorus 2]
I, I will begin again
I, I will begin again

[Instrumental Interlude]

[Bridge]
Oh
Maybe the time is right
Oh, maybe tonight

[Chorus]
I will be with you again
I will be with you again

[Verse 3]
And so we're told this is the golden age
And gold is the reason for the wars we wage
Though I want to be with you
Be with you night and day
Nothing changes
On New Year's Day
On New Year's Day
On New Year's DayIf you twist and turn away
If you tear yourself in two again
If I could, yes I would
If I could, I would let it go
Surrender, dislocate

If I could throw this lifeless lifeline to the wind
Leave this heart of clay, see you walk, walk away
Into the night, and through the rain
Into the half light and through the flame

If I could, through myself, set your spirit free
I'd lead your heart away, see you break, break away
Into the light and to the day

Hoo, hoo!
Hoo, hoo!
Hoo, hoo!
Hoo, hoo!
Hoo, hoo!
Hoo, hoo!

To let it go and so to fade away
To let it go and so fade away
I'm wide awake
I'm wide awake, wide awake
I'm not sleeping
Oh no, no, no

If you should ask, then maybe
They'd tell you what I would say
True colours fly in blue and black
Blue silken sky and burning flag
Colours crash, collide in blood-shot eyes

Hoo, hoo!
Hoo, hoo!
Hoo, hoo!

If I could, you know I would
If I could, I would let it go

This desperation, dislocation
Separation, condemnation
Revelation, in temptation
Isolation, desolation
Let it go and so fade away
To let it go, oh yeah, and so fade away
To let it go, oh no, and so to fade away

I'm wide awake, I'm wide awake
Wide awake, I'm not sleeping
Oh no, no, noIts like the room just cleared of smoke
I didn't even want the heart you broke
Its yours to keep
You just might need one

I finally found my real name
I wont be me when you see me again
No, I wont be my fathers son

[Chorus]
Im more than you know
Im more than you see here
More than you let me be
Im more than you know
A body in a soul
You dont see me but you will
I am not invisible

(That's right
Ill be in the invisible world)

I dont dream, not as such
I dont even think about you that much
Unless I start to think at all

All those frozen days
And your frozen ways
They melt away your face like snow

[Chorus]
Im more than you know
Im more than you see here
Im more than you let me be
Im more than you know
A body in a soul
You dont see me but you will
I am not invisible
I am here

[Outro]
There is no them
There is no them
Theres only us
Theres only us
There is no them
There is no them
Theres only us
Theres only us
There is no them
There is no them
Theres only you
And theres only me
There is no them[Verse 1]
You say you want
Diamonds on a ring of gold
You say you want
Your story to remain untold

[Chorus]
But all the promises we make
From the cradle to the grave
When all I want is you

[Verse 2]
You say you'll give me
A highway with no-one on it
Treasure, just to look upon it
All the riches in the night

[Verse 3]
You say you'll give me
Eyes in the moon of blindness
A river in a time of dryness
A harbour in the tempest

[Chorus]
But all the promises we make
From the cradle to the grave
When all I want is you

[Verse 4]
You say you want
Your love to work out right
To last with me through the night

[Verse 5]
You say you want
Diamonds on a ring of gold
Your story to remain untold
Your love not to grow cold

[Final Chorus]
All the promises we break
From the cradle to the grave
When all I want is you

[Outro]
You, all I want is
You, all I want is
You, all I want is
You[Verse 1]
The star
That gives us light
Has been gone a while
But it's not an illusion
The ache
In my heart
Is so much a part of who I am
Something in your eyes
Took a thousand years to get here
Something in your eyes
Took a thousand years, a thousand years

[Chorus]
Hold me close, hold me close and don't let me go
Hold me close like I'm someone that you might know
Hold me close the darkness just lets us see
Who we are
Ive got your light inside of me
Iris, Iris

[Verse 2]
Once we are born, we begin to forget
The very reason we came
But you
I'm sure I've met
Long before the night the stars went out
We're meeting up again

[Chorus]
Hold me close, hold me close and don't let me go
Hold me close like I'm someone that you might know
Hold me close, the darkness just lets us see
Who we are
I've got your light inside of me
Iris, Iris

[Bridge]
The stars are bright but do they know
The universe is beautiful but cold

You took me by the hand
I thought that I was leading you
But it was you made me your man
Machine
I dream
Where you are
Iris standing in the hall
She tells me I can do it all
Iris wakes to my nightmares
Don't fear the world it isn't there

Iris playing on the strand
She buries the boy beneath the sand
Iris says that I will be the death of her
It was not me

Iris, Iris

She says
Free yourself to be yourself, if only you could see yourself
Free yourself to be yourself, if only you could see...[Verse 1]
Face down on a broken street
Theres a man in the corner in a pool of misery
Im in white van as a red sea covers the ground
Metal crash, I cant tell what it is
But I take a look, and now Im sorry I did
5:30 on a Friday night, 33 good people cut down

[Refrain]
I dont believe anymore
I dont believe anymore

[Verse 2]
Face down on a pillow of shame
There are some girls with a needle trying to spell my name
My bodys not a canvas
My bodys now a toilet wall

[Refrain]
I dont believe anymore
I dont believe anymore

[Chorus]
Raised by wolves
Stronger than fear
Raised by wolves
We were raised by wolves
Raised by wolves
Stronger than fear
If I open my eyes
You disappear

[Verse 3]
Boy sees his father crushed under the weight
Of a cross in a passion where the passion is hate
Blue mink Ford, Im gonna detonate and you're dead
Blood in the house
Blood on the street
The worst things in the world are justified by belief
Registration 1385-WZ

[Refrain]
I dont believe anymore
I dont believe anymore

[Chorus]
Raised by wolves
Stronger than fear
Raised by wolves
We were raised by wolves
Raised by wolves
Stronger than fear
If I open my eyes
You disappear[Verse 1]
The door is open to go through
If I could I would come too
But the path is made by you
As you're walking start singing and stop talking

[Chorus]
Oh, if I could hear myself when I say
Oh, love is bigger than anything in its way

[Verse 2]
So young to be the words of your own song
I know the rage in you is strong
Write a world where we can belong
To each other and sing it like no other

[Chorus]
Oh, if I could hear myself when I say
Oh, love is bigger than anything in its way

[Bridge]
If the moonlight caught you crying on Killiney Bay
Oh sing your song
Let your song be sung
If you listen you can hear the silence say
When you think you're done
You've just begun

[Outro]
Love is bigger than anything in its way
Love is bigger than anything in its way
Love is bigger than anything in its way[Intro]

[Verse 1]
California, then we fell into the shining sea
The weight that drags your heart down
Well that's what took me where I need to be
Which is here
Out on Zuma
Watching you cry like a baby
California, at the dawn you thought would never come
But it did
Like it always does

[Chorus 1]
All I know
And all I need to know is there is no, yeah there is no end to love

[Verse 2]
I didn't call you
Words can scare a thought away
Everyone's a star in our town
It's just your light gets dimmer if you have to stay
In your bedroom
In a mirror
Watching yourself cry like a baby
California, blood orange sunset brings you to your knees
I've seen for myself
There's no end to grief
That's how I know

[Chorus 2]
That's how I know
And why I need to know that there is no, yeah there is no end to love
All I know and all I need to know is there is no, yeah there is no end to love

[Guitar Solo]

[Chorus 3]
All I know
And all I need to know is there is no, yeah there is no end to love
We come and go
Stolen days you don't give back
Stolen days are just enough[Verse 1]
I shouldn't be here 'cause I should be dead
I can see the lights in front of me
I believe my best days are ahead
I can see the lights in front of me
Oh, Jesus, if I'm still your friend
What the hell
What the hell you got for me?
I gotta get out from under my bed
To see again the lights in front of me
Hey, I've been waiting to get home a long time

[Chorus]
Hey now, do you know my name?
Hey now, where I'm going
If I can't get an answer
In your eyes, I see it
The lights of home
The lights of home

[Verse 2]
I was born from a screaming sound
I can see the lights in front of me
I thought my head was harder than ground
I can see the lights in front of me
One more push and I'll be born again
One more road you can't travel with a friend
Saw a statue of a gold guitar
Bright lights right in front of me
Hey, I've been waiting to get home a long time

[Chorus]
Hey now, do you know my name?
Hey now, where I'm going
If I can't get an answer
In your eyes, I see it
The lights of home
In the lights of home

[Interlude]

[Chorus]
Hey now, do you know my name?
Hey now, where I'm going
If I can't get an answer
In your eyes, I see it
In your eyes alone
I see the lights of home

[Outro]
Free yourself to be yourself
If only you could you see yourself
If only you could
Free yourself to be yourself
If only you could see yourself
If only you could
Free yourself to be yourself
If only you could see yourself
If only you could
Free yourself to be yourself
If only you could see yourself
If only you could see[Verse 1]
And if the terrors of the night
Come creeping into your days
And the world comes stealing children from your room
Guard your innocence from hallucination
And know that darkness always gathers around the light

[Chorus]
If there is a light
We can't always see
If there is a world
We can't always be
If there is a dark
Now we shouldn't doubt
And there is a light
Don't let it go out

[Verse 2]
When the wind screams and shouts
And the sea is a dragon's tail
And the ship that stole your heart away
Sets sail

[Pre-Chorus]
When all you've left is leaving
And all you got is grieving
And all you know is needing

[Chorus]
If there is a light
We can't always see
If there is a world
We can't always be
If there is a dark
Now we shouldn't doubt
And there is a light
Don't let it go out

[Post-Chorus]
'Cause this is a song
A song for someone
Someone like me

[Bridge]
I know the world is dumb
But you don't have to be
I've got a question for the child in you before it leaves
Are you tough enough to be kind?
Do you know your heart has its own mind?
Darkness gathers around the light
Hold on
Hold on

[Chorus]
There is a light
We can't always see
If there is a world
We can't always be
If there is a dark
That we shouldn't doubt
And there is a light
Don't let it go out

[Outro]
And this is a song
A song for someone
This is a song
A song for someone
Someone like me
Someone like me
Someone like meNothing to stop this being the best day ever
Nothing to keep us from where we should be
I wanted the world but you knew better
And that all we have is immortality

There is a light

Love and love is all we have left
A baby cries on a doorstep
Love is all we have left
Love and love is all we have left
You argue because you cant accept
Love is all we have left

Now youre at the other end of a telescope
Seven billion stars in her eyes
So many stars
So many ways of seeing
Hey this is no time not to be alive

Love and love is all we have left
A baby cries on a doorstep
Love is all we have left

Love and love is all we have left
The only thing that can be kept
Love is all we have left[Verse 1]
A dinosaur, wonders why it still walks the earth, yeah
A meteor, promises it's not gonna hurt, yeah
Earthquake, always happen when you're in bed, Fred
The house shakes, maybe was it something I said, Ned

Go, easy on me, easy on me, brother
Go, easy on me, easy on me, brother

[Chorus]
When the lights go out, throw yourself about
In the darkness where you learn to see
When the lights go out, dont you ever doubt
The light that we can really be

[Verse 2]
Statues fall, democracy is flat on its back, Jack
We had it all, and what we had is not coming back, Zach
A big mouth says the people, they don't wanna be free for free
The blackout, is this an extinction event we see?

Go, easy on me, easy on me, brother
Go, easy on me, easy on me, now

[Chorus]
When the lights go out, throw yourself about
In the darkness where you learn to see
When the lights go out, don't you ever doubt
The light that we can really be

When the lights go out
When the lights go out
When the lights go out
When the lights go out
When the lights go out

Blackout, it's clear, who you are will appear
Blackout, no fear, so glad that we are all still here

When the lights go out
When the lights go out
When the lights go out

[Chorus]
When the lights go out, throw yourself about
In the darkness where you learn to see
When the lights go out, don't you ever doubt
The light that we can really be

When the lights go out
When the lights go out
When the lights go out
When the lights go out
When the lights go outI know a girl
A girl called Party, Party Girl
I know she wants more than a party, Party Girl
And she won't tell me her name

I know a boy
A boy called Trash, Trash Can
I know he does all that he can, wham bam
And she won't tell me his name

When I was three
I thought the world revolved around me
I was wrong
But you can sing, sing along
And if you dance
Then dance with me

I know a girl
A girl called Party, Party Girl
I know she wants more than a party, Party Girl

I know a boy
A boy called Trampoline
You know what I mean
I think you know what he wants
I think he knows what he wants
I think he knows what he wants[Verse 1]
The world is spinning fast tonight
You can hurt yourself tryin' to hold on
To what you used to be
Im so glad the past is all gone

[Pre-Chorus]
Been out in the wild
Been out in the night
Been out of your mind
Do you live here or is this a vacation?

[Chorus]
Oh, volcano
You dont wanna, you dont wanna know
Volcano
Something in you wants to blow
Volcano
You dont wanna, you dont wanna know

[Verse 2]
Your eyes were like landing lights
They used to be the clearest blue
Now you dont see so well
The futures gonna land on you

[Pre-Chorus]
Been out in the wild
Been out in the night
Been out of your mind
Do you live here or is this a vacation?

[Chorus]
Oh, volcano
You dont wanna, you dont wanna know
Volcano
Something in you wants to blow
Volcano
You dont wanna, you dont wanna know
Youre on a piece of ground above a volcano

[Bridge]
You were alone
And now youre not alone
You were alone
You are Rock N Roll
You and I are Rock N Roll
You are Rock N Roll
You and I are Rock N Roll

[Chorus]
Oh, volcano
You dont wanna, you dont wanna know
Volcano
Something in you wants to blow
Volcano
You dont wanna, you dont wanna know
Youre on a piece of ground above a volcano[Verse 1]
The night gave you a song
A light had been turned on
You walked out in the world
Like you belong there

As easy as a breeze
Each heart was yours to please
Is it only me who sees
Theres something wrong there

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh la la, Im not a ghost now
I can see you
You need to see me

[Chorus]
Its the little things that give you away
The words you cannot say
Your big mouth in the way

[Verse 2]
I saw you on the stairs
You didnt notice I was there
Thats cause you were talking at me
And not to me

You were high above the storm
A hurricane being born
This freedom it might cost you
Your liberty

[Chorus]
Its the little things that give you away
The words you cannot say
Your big mouth in the way
Its the little things that tease and betray
Has the hunter now become the prey?
Its the little things
The little things that give you away

[Outro]
Sometimes
I cant believe my existence
See myself from a distance
I cant get back inside

Sometimes
The air is so anxious
All my thoughts are so reckless
And all my innocence has died

Sometimes
I wake at four in the morning
Where all the darkness is swarming
And it covers me in fear

Sometimes
Sometimes
Sometimes

Sometimes
I'm full of anger and grieving
So far away from believing
That any sun will reappear

Sometimes
The end is not coming
Its not coming
The end is here
Sometimes

[Guitar Solo]

Sometimes
Sometimes
Sometimes

Sometimes
When the painted glass shatters
And youre the only thing matters
But I cant see you through the tears

Sometimes
The end is not coming
Its not coming
The end is here
Sometimes[Verse 1]
I was running down the road
The fear was all I knew
I was looking for a soul thats real
Then I ran into you
And that cherry blossom tree
Was a gateway to the sun
And friendship, once its won
Its won... its won

[Chorus]
Northside just across the river to the Southside
Thats a long way here
All the green and all the gold
The hurt you hide, the joy you hold
The foolish pride that gets you out the door
Up on Cedarwood, Cedarwood Road

[Verse 2]
Sleepwalking down the road
Not waking from these dreams
Cause its never dead, its still my head
It was a warzone in my teens
Im still standing on that street
Still need an enemy
The worst ones I cant see
You can... you can

[Chorus]
Northside just across the river from the Southside
Thats a long way here
All the green and all the gold
The hurt you hide and the joy you hold
The foolish pride that sends you back for more
Up on Cedarwood, Cedarwood Road

[Verse 3]
If the door is open it isnt theft
You cant return to where youve never left
Blossoms falling from a tree, they cover you and cover me
Symbols clashing, Bibles smashing
Paint the world you need to see
Sometimes fear is the only place that we can call our home
Cedarwood Road

[Outro]
And a heart that is broken
Is a heart that is open, open, open[Verse 1]
Johnny, take a walk with your sister the moon
Let her pale light in, to fill up your room
You've been living underground, eating from a can
You've been running away from what you don't understand, love

[Pre-Chorus]
She's slippy, you're sliding down
She'll be there when you hit the ground

[Chorus]
It's alright, it's alright, it's alright
She moves in mysterious ways
It's alright, it's alright, it's alright
She moves in mysterious ways, oh

[Verse 2]
Johnny, take a dive with your sister in the rain
Let her talk about the things you can't explain
To touch is to heal, to hurt is to steal
If you want to kiss the sky, better learn how to kneel
On your knees, boy!

[Pre-Chorus]
She's the wave, she turns the tide
She sees the man inside the child

[Chorus]
It's alright, it's alright, it's alright
She moves in mysterious ways, oh
It's alright, it's alright, it's alright
She moves in mysterious ways, oh
It's alright, It's alright, alright
Lift my days, light up my nights, oh

[Bridge]
One day you'll look back, and you'll see
Where you were held now by this love
While you could stand there
You could move on this moment
Follow this feeling

[Chorus]
It's alright, it's alright, it's alright
She moves in mysterious ways
It's alright, it's alright, it's alright
She moves in mysterious ways, oh

[Outro]
Move you, spirits move you
Move, spirits 'its move you, oh yeah
Does it move you?
She moves with it
Lift my days, and light up my nights, oh
We move through miracle days
Spirit moves in mysterious ways
She moves with it
She moves with it
Lift my days, light up my nights[Verse 1]
In the howlin' wind
Comes a stingin' rain
See it drivin' nails
Into the souls on the tree of pain

From the firefly
A red orange glow
See the face of fear
Runnin' scared in the valley below

[Chorus]
Bullet the blue sky
Bullet the blue sky
Bullet the blue
Bullet the blue

[Verse 2]
In the locust wind
Comes a rattle and hum
Jacob wrestled the angel
And the angel was overcome

You plant a demon seed
You raise a flower of fire
We see them burnin' crosses
See the flames, higher and higher

[Chorus]
Bullet the blue sky
Bullet the blue sky
Bullet the blue
Bullet the blue

[Verse 3]
Suit and tie comes up to me
His face red like a rose on a thorn bush
Like all the colours of a royal flush
And he's peelin' off those dollar bills
(Slappin' 'em down)
One hundred, two hundred

And I can see those fighter planes
And I can see those fighter planes
Across the mud huts as children sleep
Through the alleys of a quiet city street
And take the staircase to the first floor
Turn the key and slowly unlock the door
As a man breathes into his saxophone
And through the walls you hear the city groan
Outside, it's America
Outside, it's America
America

[Outro]
See across the field
See the sky ripped open
See the rain comin' through the gapin' wound
Pelting the women and children
Who run into the arms
Of America[Verse 1]
I am made of all that I'm afraid of
I'm most afraid of losing you
Hell's a season
You're the reason that I even dreamt of getting through

[Pre-Chorus]
I, I can feel your body shaking
I, I will meet you where the waves are breaking

[Chorus]
Baby it's a Red Flag Day
Baby let's get in the water
Taken out by a wave
Where we've never been before

Baby it's a Red Flag Day
Baby let's go a bit further
Paradise is a place
You can't see when it's yours
Red Flag Day
Red Flag Day

[Verse 2]
Sun comes here and oceanic feeling
Sky will soon be clear
Today we can't afford to be afraid of what we fear

[Pre-Chorus]
I, I can feel your body shaking
I, I will meet you where the waves are breaking

[Chorus]
Baby it's a Red Flag Day
Baby let's get in the water
Taken out by a wave
Where we've never been before

Baby it's a Red Flag Day
Baby let's go a bit further
Paradise is a place
You can't see when it's yours
Red Flag Day
Baby it's a Red Flag Day
Red Flag Day

[Refrain]
Not even news today
So many lost in the sea last night
One word that the sea cant say
Is no, no, no, no

[Chorus]
Baby it's a Red Flag Day
Red Flag Day
Baby it's a Red Flag Day
Baby let's get in the water[Verse 1]
Roam, the phone is where I live 'til I get home
And when the doorbell rings you tell me that I have a key
I ask you, how you know it's me

The road, no road without a turn and if there was
The road would be too long
What keeps us standing in this view
Is the view that we can be brand new

[Chorus]
The landlady takes me up in the air
I go, I go where I would not dare
The landlady shows me the stars up there
I'm weightless, weightless when she is there
And I'll never know, never know what starving poets meant
'Cause when I was broke, it was you that always paid the rent

[Verse 2]
Space, her place is where I found my parking space
And when I'm losing ground, you know she gives it back to me
She whispers "don't do, just be"

[Chorus]
The landlady takes me up in the air
I go, I go where I would not dare
The landlady shows me the stars up there
I'm weightless, weightless when she is there
And I'll never know, never know what starving poets meant
'Cause when I was broke, it was you that always paid the rent

[Outro]
Every wave that broke me
Every song that wrote me
Every dawn that woke me
Was to get me home to you, see

Every soul that left me
Every heart that kept me
The strangers that protected me
To bring me back to you

Every magic potion
Every false emotion
How unswerving our devotion
To the lies we know are almost true

Every sweet confusion
Every grand illusion
I will win and call it losing
If the prize is not for you[Verse 1]
And so she woke up
Woke up from where she was lyin' still
Said I gotta do something
About where we're going
Step on a steam train
Step out of the driving rain, maybe
Run from the darkness in the night
Singing ah, ah la la la de day
Ah la la la de day
Ah la la la de day

[Verse 2]
Sweet the sin
Bitter the taste in my mouth
I see seven towers
But I only see one way out
You gotta cry without weeping, talk without speaking
Scream without raising your voice
You know I took the poison from the poison stream
Then I floated out of here, singing
Ah la la la de day
Ah la la la de day
Ah la la la de day

[Vocalization on Bridge]

[Verse 3]
She runs through the streets
With her eyes painted red
Under a black belly of cloud in the rain
In through a doorway
She brings me white golden pearls
Stolen from the sea
She is ragin', she is raging
And the storm blows up in her eyes
She will suffer the needle chill
She's running to stand still

[Harmonica Solo][Spoken intro]
And love is not the easy thing
The only baggage you can bring...
And love is not the easy thing....
The only baggage you can bring
Is all that you can't leave behind

[Verse 1]
And if the darkness is to keep us apart
And if the daylight feels like it's a long way off
And if your glass heart should crack
And for a second you turn back
Oh no, be strong

[Chorus]
Walk on, walk on
What you got they can't steal it
No they can't even feel it
Walk on, walk on...
Stay safe tonight

[Verse 2]
You're packing a suitcase for a place none of us has been
A place that has to be believed to be seen
You could have flown away
A singing bird in an open cage
Who will only fly, only fly for freedom

[Chorus]
Walk on, walk on
What you've got they can't deny it
Can't sell it, or buy it
Walk on, walk on
Stay safe tonight

[Post-Chorus]
And I know it aches
And your heart it breaks
And you can only take so much
Walk on, walk on

[Bridge]
Home, hard to know what it is if you've never had one
Home, I can't say where it is but I know I'm going home
That's where the heart is

[Post-Chorus]
And I know it aches
And your heart it breaks
And you can only take so much
Walk on, walk on

[Interlude]
Leave it behind
You've got to leave it behind

[Bridge 2]
All that you fashion
All that you make
All that you build
All that you break
All that you measure
All that you steal
All this you can leave behind
All that you reason
All that you care
It's only time
And I'll never fill up all my mind
All that you sense
All that you speak
All you dress up
And all that you scheme
All you create
All that you wreck
All that you hate[Chorus]
All my friends are heathens, take it slow (In the city, boy, in the city)
Wait for them to ask you who you know
Please don't make any sudden moves
You don't know the half of the abuse
All my friends are heathens, take it slow
Wait for them to ask you who you know
Please don't make any sudden moves
You don't know the half of the abuse

[Verse 1]
Welcome to the room of people
Who have rooms of people that they loved one day
Stocked away
Just because we check the guns at the door
Doesn't mean our brains will change from hand grenades
You're lovin' on the psychopath sitting next to you
You're lovin' on the murderer sitting next to you
You'll think, "How'd I get here, sitting next to you?"
But after all I've said, please don't forget

[Chorus]
All my friends are heathens, take it slow
Wait for them to ask you who you know
Please don't make any sudden moves
You don't know the half of the abuse

[Verse 2]
We don't deal with outsiders very well
They say newcomers have a certain smell
You have trust issues, not to mention
They say they can smell your intentions
You're lovin' on the freakshow sitting next to you
You'll have some weird people sitting next to you
You'll think "How did I get here, sitting next to you?"
But after all I've said, please don't forget
(Watch it, watch it)

[Chorus]
All my friends are heathens, take it slow (In the city, boy, in the city)
Wait for them to ask you who you know
Please don't make any sudden moves
You don't know the half of the abuse

[Bridge]
All my friends are heathens, take it slow (Watch it)
Wait for them to ask you who you know (Watch it)
Please all my friends are heathens, take it slow (Watch it)
Wait for them to ask you who you know

[Outro]
Why'd you come? You knew you should have stayed (It's blasphemy)
I tried to warn you just to stay away (Wouldn't listen to me)
And now they're outside ready to bust (To bust) (And guess what?)
It looks like you might be one of us[Verse 1]
I wish I found some better sounds no one's ever heard
I wish I had a better voice that sang some better words
I wish I found some chords in an order that is new
I wish I didn't have to rhyme every time I sang
I was told, when I get older, all my fears would shrink
But now I'm insecure, an' I care what people think

[Pre-Chorus]
My name's Blurryface and I care what you think
My name's Blurryface and I care what you think

[Chorus]
Wish we could turn back time to the good old days
When our momma sang us to sleep, but now we're stressed out
(Oh) Wish we could turn back time (Oh) to the good old days (Oh)
When our momma sang us to sleep, but now we're stressed out
We're stressed out

[Verse 2]
Sometimes a certain smell will take me back to when I was young
How come I'm never able to identify where it's comin' from?
I'd make a candle out of it, if I ever found it
Try to sell it, never sell out of it, I'd probably only sell one
It'd be to my brother, 'cause we have the same nose
Same clothes, homegrown, a stone's throw from a creek we used to roam
But it would remind us of when nothing really mattered
Out of student loans and treehouse homes, we all would take the latter

[Pre-Chorus]
My-my-my name's Blurryface and I care what you think
My name's Blurryface and I care what you think

[Chorus]
Wish we could turn back time to the good old days
When our momma sang us to sleep, but now we're stressed out
(Oh) Wish we could turn back time (Oh) to the good old days (Oh)
When our momma sang us to sleep, but now we're stressed out

[Bridge]
We used to play pretend, give each other different names
We would build a rocket ship an' then we'd fly it far away
Used to dream of outer space, but now they're laughin' at our face
Sayin', "Wake up, you need to make money!," yeah
We used to play pretend, give each other different names
We would build a rocket ship an' then we'd fly it far away
Used to dream of outer space, but now they're laughin' at our face
Sayin', "Wake up, you need to make money!," yeah

[Chorus]
Wish we could turn back time to the good old days
When our momma sang us to sleep, but now we're stressed out
(Oh) Wish we could turn back time (Oh) to the good old days (Oh)
When our momma sang us to sleep, but now we're stressed out

[Outro]
We used to play pretend, used to play pretend, money
We used to play pretend, wake up, you need the money
Used to play pretend, used to play pretend, money
We used to play pretend, wake up, you need the money
Used to play pretend, give each other different names
We would build a rocket ship an' then we'd fly it far away
Used to dream of outer space, but now they're laughin' at our face
Sayin', "Wake up, you need to make money!," yeah[Verse 1]
I just wanna stay in the sun where I find
I know it's hard sometimes
Pieces of peace in the sun's peace of mind
I know it's hard sometimes
Yeah, I think about the end just way too much
But it's fun to fantasize
On my enemies I wouldn't wish who I was
But it's fun to fantasize (Size, size)

[Chorus]
Oh-woah-woah, oh-woah-woah, I'm fallin'
So I'm takin' my time on my ride, oh-woah-woah, I'm fallin'
So I'm takin' my time on my ride
Takin' my time on my ride

[Verse 2]
"I'd die for you," that's easy to say
We have a list of people that we would take
A bullet for them, a bullet for you
A bullet for everybody in this room
But I don't seem to see many bullets comin' through
See many bullets comin' through
Metaphorically, I'm the man
But literally, I don't know what I'd do
"I'd live for you," an' that's hard to do
Even harder to say when you know it's not true
Even harder to write when you know that tonight
There were people back home who tried talkin' to you
But then you ignore them still
All these questions they're for real
Like who would you live for? Who would you die for?
And would you ever kill?

[Chorus]
Oh-woah-woah, oh-woah-woah, I'm fallin'
So I'm takin' my time on my ride, oh-woah-woah, I'm fallin'
So I'm takin' my time on my ride
Takin' my time on my ride

[Bridge]
I've been thinkin' too much
I've been thinkin' too much
I've been thinkin' too much
I've been thinkin' too much
Help me
I've been thinkin' too much
I've been thinkin' too much
I've been thinkin' too much
Help me
I've been thinkin' too much
I've been thinkin' too much
I've been thinkin' too much

[Chorus]
Oh-woah-woah, oh-woah-woah, I'm fallin'
So I'm takin' my time on my ride, oh-woah-woah, I'm fallin'
So I'm takin' my time
Takin' my time on my ride, woah-oh-oh (Wuh, yeah)
Oh-woah-woah, oh-woah-woah, I'm fallin'
So I'm takin' my time on my ride, oh-woah-woah, I'm fallin'
So I'm takin' my time on my

I've been thinkin' too much
Help me
I've been thinkin' too much
Help me
I've been thinkin' too much
I've been thinkin' too much
I've been thinkin' too much
Help me
I've been thinkin' too much
I've been thinkin' too much

Help me[Intro: Paul Meany]
So, where are ya? It's been a little while

[Chorus]
Sippin' on straight chlorine
Let the vibe slide over me
This beat is a chemical, beat is a chemical
When I leave, don't save my seat
I'll be back when it's all complete
The moment is medical, moment is medical
Sippin' on straight chlorine

[Verse 1]
Lovin' what I'm tastin', woah
Venom on my tongue, dependent at times
Poisonous vibrations, woah
Help my body run

[Refrain]
I'm runnin' for my life
Runnin' for my life

[Chorus]
Sippin' on straight chlorine
Let the vibe slide over me
This beat is a chemical, beat is a chemical
When I leave, don't save my seat
I'll be back when it's all complete
The moment is medical, moment is medical
Sippin' on straight chlorine

[Verse 2]
Fall out of formation, woah
I plan my escape from walls they confined
Rebel red carnation, woa-a-oh
Grows while I decay

[Refrain]
I'm runnin' for my life
Runnin' for my life
Yeah, I'm runnin' for my life
Runnin' for my life

[Verse 3]
Hide you in my coat pocket, where I kept my rebel red
I felt I was invincible, you wrapped around my head
Now different lives I lead, my body lives on lead
The last two lines may read incorrect until said
The lead is terrible in flavor
But now you double as a paper maker
I despise you sometimes, I love to hate the fight
And you in my life is like

[Chorus]
Sippin' on straight chlorine
Let the vibe slide over me
This beat is a chemical, beat is a chemical
When I leave, don't save my seat
I'll be back when it's all complete
The moment is medical, moment is medical
Sippin' on straight chlorine

[Interlude]
Let the vibe, let the vibe
Let the vibe, let the vibe
Beat is a chemical, yeah
Let the vibe, let the vibe
Let the vibe, let the vibe
Moment is medical, yeah
Sippin' on straight chlorine
Let the vibe, let the vibe
Let the vibe, let the vibe
Beat is a chemical, yeah
Let the vibe, let the vibe
Let the vibe, let the vibe
Moment is medical, yeah

[Outro]
I'm so sorry I forgot you
Let me catch you up to speed
I've been tested like the ends of
A weathered flag that's by the sea
Can you build my house with pieces?
I'm just a chemical
Can you build my house with pieces?
I'm just a chemical
Can you build my house with pieces?
I'm just a chemical
Can you build my house with pieces?
I'm just a chemical[Intro (Reversed)]

East is up, I'm fearless when I hear this on the low
East is up, I'm careless when I wear my rebel clothes
East is up, when Bishops come together they will know that
Dema don't control us, Dema don't control
East is up

[Verse 1]
They want to make you forget
They want to make you forget
Save your razorblades now, not yet
Save your razorblades now, not yet

[Chorus]
I'm heavy, my jumpsuit is on steady
I'm lighter when I'm lower, I'm higher when I'm heavy, oh
I'm so high, my Jumpsuit takes me so high
I'm flying from a fire, from Nico and the Niners, oh
East is up, I'm fearless when I hear this on the low
East is up, I'm careless when I wear my rebel clothes
East is up, when Bishops come together they will know that
Dema don't control us, Dema don't control
I'm heavy, my jumpsuit is on steady

Lighter when I'm lower, higher when I'm heavy, oh
I'm so high, I'm so high
So high, I'm so high
Fire, Nico and the Niners

[Verse 2]
What I say when I want to be enough
What a beautiful day for making a break for it
We'll find a way to pay for it
Maybe from all the money we made razorblade stores
Rent a racehorse and force a sponsor
And start a concert, a complete diversion
Start a mob and you can be quite certain
We'll win but not everyone will get out
No, no
We'll win but not everyone will get out
No, no
We'll win but not everyone will get out

[Chorus]
East is up, I'm fearless when I hear this on the low

I ponder of something great
My lungs will fill and then deflate
They fill with fire, exhale desire
I know it's dire, my time today

[Chorus]
I have these thoughts so often, I ought
To replace that slot with what I once bought
'Cause somebody stole my car radio
And now I just sit in silence

[Verse 2]
Sometimes quiet is violent, I find it hard to hide it
My pride is no longer inside
It's on my sleeve, my skin will scream
Reminding me of who I killed inside my dream
I hate this car that I'm driving, there's no hiding for me
I'm forced to deal with what I feel
There is no distraction to mask what is real
I could pull the steering wheel

[Chorus]
I have these thoughts so often, I ought
To replace that slot with what I once bought
'Cause somebody stole my car radio
And now I just sit in silence

[Verse 3]
I ponder of something terrifying
'Cause this time there's no sound to hide behind
I find over the course of our human existence
One thing consists of consistence
And it's that we're all battling fear
Oh dear, I don't know if we know why we're here
Oh my, too deep - please stop thinking
I liked it better when my car had sound
There are things we can do
But from the things that work there are only two
And from the two that we choose to do
Peace will win and fear will lose
And there's faith and there's sleep, we
Need to pick one please because
Faith is to be awake
And to be awake is for us to think
And for us to think is to be alive
And I will try with every rhyme
To come across like I am dying
To let you know you need to try to think

[Chorus]
I have these thoughts so often, I ought
To replace that slot with what I once bought
'Cause somebody stole my car radio
And now I just sit in silence

[Bridge]
And now I just sit in silence
And now I just sit in silence
And now I just sit
And now I just sit in silence
And now I just sit in silence
And now I just sit in silence
And now I just sit

I ponder of something great
My lungs will fill and then deflate
They fill with fire, exhale desire

Sometimes you gotta bleed to know
That you're alive and have a soul
But it takes someone to come around to show you how

[Chorus]
She's the tear in my heart, I'm alive
She's the tear in my heart, I'm on fire
She's the tear in my heart, take me higher
Than I've ever been

The songs on the radio are okay
But my taste in music is your face
An' it takes a song to come around to show you how

She's the tear in my heart, I'm alive
She's the tear in my heart, I'm on fire
She's the tear in my heart, take me higher

You fell asleep in my car, I drove the whole time
But that's okay, I'll just avoid the holes so you sleep fine
I'm driving here I sit, cursing my government
For not usin' my taxes to fill holes with more cement
You fell asleep in my car, I drove the whole time
But that's okay, I'll just avoid the holes so you sleep fine
I'm driving here I sit, cursing my government
For not using my taxes to fill holes with more cement
Sometimes you gotta bleed to know, oh, oh
That you're alive and have a soul, oh, oh
But it takes someone to come around to show you how

She's the tear in my heart, I'm alive
She's the tear in my heart, I'm on fire
She's the tear in my heart, take me higher

My heart is my armor
She's the tear in my heart, she's a carver
She's a butcher with a smile, cut me farther

Oh, than I've ever been
My heart is my armor
She's the tear in my heart, she's a carver
She's a butcher with a smile, cut me farther

[Verse 1]
There's an infestation in my mind's imagination
I hope that they choke on smoke 'cause I'm smokin' them out the basement
This is not rap, this is not hip-hop
Just another attempt to make the voices stop
Rappin' to prove nothin', just writin' to say somethin'
'Cause I wasn't the only one who wasn't rushin' to sayin' nothin'
This doesn't mean I lost my dream
It's just right now I got a really crazy mind to clean

Gangsters don't cry, therefore, therefore I'm

Can you save my heavydirtysoul?
For me, for me (Uh)
Can you save my heavydirtysoul?
For me, for me (Uh)
Can you save my heavydirtysoul?

[Verse 2]
Nah, I didn't understand a thing you said
If I didn't know better, I'd guess you're all already dead
Mindless zombies walkin' around with a limp an' a hunch
Sayin' stuff like, "You only live once"
You've got one time to figure it out
One time to twist and one time to shout
One time to think and I say we start now
Sing it with me if you know what I'm talkin' about

[Pre-Chorus]
Gangsters don't cry, therefore, therefore I'm
Mr. Misty-eyed, therefore I'm (I'm)

Can you save, can you save my
Can you save my heavydirtysoul?

I'll go with you, I'll go with you, yeah

[Chorus]
Stay with me, no, you don't need to run
Stay with me, my blood, you don't need to run
Stay with me, no, you don't need to run
Stay with me, my blood, you don't need to run

[Verse 3]
If there comes a day
People posted up at the end of your driveway
They're callin' for your head and they're callin' for your name
I'll bomb down on 'em, I'm comin' through
Did they know I was grown with you?
If they're here to smoke, know I'll go with you
Just keep it outside, keep it outside, yeah

[Chorus]
Stay with me, no, you don't need to run
Stay with me, my blood, you don't need to run
Stay with me, no, you don't need to run
Stay with me, my blood, you don't need to run
(Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh)
You don't need to run
(Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh)
You don't need to run
(Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh)
You don't need to run
(Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh)
You don't need to run

[Verse 4]
If you find yourself in a lion's den
I'll jump right in and pull my pin

[Refrain]
And go with you, I'll go with you
I'll go with you, I'll go with you
(You don't need to run)
I'll go with you, I'll go with you
(You don't need to run)
I'll go with you
My blood, I'll go with you, yeah

[Chorus]
Stay with me, no, you don't need to run
Stay with me, my blood, you don't need to run
Stay with me, no, you don't need to run
Stay with me, my blood, you don't need to run

You don't need to run
(Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh)
You don't need to run
Stay with me, no, you don't need to run
Stay with me, my blood[Intro]
Move!

[Verse 1]
Can't stop thinking about if and when I die
For now I see that "if" and "when" are truly different cries
For "if" is purely panic and "when" is solemn sorrow
And one invades today while the other spies tomorrow
We're surrounded and we're hounded
There's no above, or under, or around it
For "above" is blind belief and "under" is sword to sleeve
And "around" is scientific miracle, let's pick "above" and see
For if and when we go above, the question still remains
Are we still in love and is it possible we feel the same?
And that's when goin' under starts to take my wonder
But until that time, I'll try to sing this

[Chorus]
If I keep moving, they won't know
I'll morph to someone else
What they throw at me's too slow
I'll morph to someone else
I'm just a ghost
I'll morph to someone else
A defense mechanism mode

[Verse 2]
He'll always try to stop me, that Nicolas Bourbaki
He's got no friends close but those who know him most know
He goes by Nico, he told me I'm a copy
When I'd hear him mock me, that's almost stopped me
Well, we're surrounded and we're hounded
There's no above or a secret door
What are we here for
If not to run straight through all our tormentors?
But until that time, I'll try to sing this

[Chorus]
If I keep moving, they won't know
I'll morph to someone else
What they throw at me's too slow
I'll morph to someone else
I'm just a ghost
I'll morph to someone else
A defense mechanism mode
I'll morph to someone else

[Bridge]
Lights, they blink to me, transmitting things to me
Ones and zeroes, ergo this symphony
Anybody listening? Ones and zeroes
Count to infinity, ones and zeroes
I'm surrounded and I'm hounded
There's no above, or under, or around it
For "above" is blind belief and "under" is sword to sleeve
And "around" is scientific miracle, let's pick "above" and see
For if and when we go above, the question still remains
Are we still in love and is it possible we feel the same?
And that's when goin' under starts to take my wonder
But until that time
I'll morph to someone else
I'm just a ghost

[Chorus]
If I keep moving, they won't know
I'll morph to someone else
What they throw at me's too slow
I'll morph to someone else
I'm just a ghost
I'll morph to someone else
A defense mechanism mode
If I keep moving, they won't know
I'll morph to someone else
A defense mechanism mode
I'll morph to someone else

[Outro]
Not done, not done
Not done, Josh Dun
I'll morph to someone else[Chorus]
Oh, I know how to levitate up off my feet
And ever since the seventh grade I learned to fire-breathe
And though I feed on things that fell
You can learn to levitate with just a little help
Learn to levitate with just a little help

[Bridge]
Come down, come down
Cowards only come through when the hour's late
And everyone's asleep, mind you
Now show up, show up
I know I shouldn't say this
But a curse from you is all that I would need right now, man
Come down, come down
Cowards only come through when the hour's late
And everyone's asleep, mind you
Now show up, show up
I know I shouldn't say this
But a curse from you is all that I would need right now, man

[Verse]
Danger in the fabric of this thing I made
I probably shouldn't show you, but it's way too late
My heart is with you hiding, but my mind's not made
Now they know it like we both knew for some time I'd say
They're smirking at fresh blood, they're circling above
But this is not enough, yeah, this is not what you thought
No, no, we are not just graffiti on a passing train
I got back what I once bought back
In that slot, I won't need to replace
This culture is a poacher of overexposure, not today
Don't feed me to the vultures, I am a vulture who feeds on pain
Sleep in a well-lit room, don't let the shadow through
And sever all I knew, yeah, sever all
I thought I could depend on my weekends
On the freezing ground that I'm sleeping on
Please, keep me from, please keep me down from the ledges
Better test it, wooden wedges under doorways
Keep your wooden wedges under doors
Chorus, verse, chorus, verse, now here comes the eight
Wait, habits here too, youre the worst, your structure compensates
But compensation feels a lot like rising up to dominate by track two
At least they all know all they hear comes from a place

[Chorus]
Oh, I know how to levitate up off my feet
And ever since the seventh grade I learned to fire-breathe
And though I feed on things that fell
You can learn to levitate with just a little help
You can levitate with just a little help

[Outro]
Welcome to Trench[Intro]
Call (Call)
Call (Call)
Call (Call)

[Verse 1]
What's my problem?
Well, I want you to follow me down to the bottom
Underneath the insane asylum
Keep your wits about you while you got 'em
'Cause your wits are first to go while you're problem-solvin'
And my problem?
We glorify those even more when they...
My opinion, our culture can treat a loss like it's a win
And right before we turn on them
We give 'em the highest of praise
And hang their banner from the ceiling
Communicating, further engraving
An earlier grave is an optional way, no

[Chorus]
Neon gravestones try to call (Neon gravestones try to call)
Neon gravestones try to call for my bones (Neon gravestones try to call)
Call (For my bones)
Call, call, call (Call, call, call)
Call (Call)
Call (Call)

[Verse 2]
What's my problem?
Don't get it twisted
It's with the people we praise who may have assisted
I could use the streams and extra conversations
I could give up, and boost up my reputation
I could go out with a bang
They would know my name
They would host and post a celebration
My opinion will not be lenient
My opinion, it's real convenient
Our words are loud, but now I'm talking action
We don't get enough love?
Well, they get a fraction
They say, "How could he go if he's got everything?
I'll mourn for a kid, but won't cry for a king"

[Chorus]
Neon gravestones try to call (Neon gravestones try to call)
Neon gravestones try to call for my bones (Neon gravestones try to call)
Call (For my bones)
Call, call, call

[Bridge 1]
Promise me this (Call, call)
If I lose to myself
You won't mourn a day
And you'll move onto someone else
Promise me this
If I lose to myself
You won't mourn a day
And you'll move onto someone else
(Ooh, call, ooh, call)

[Chorus]
Neon gravestones try to call
(Neon gravestones try to call)
Neon gravestones try to call for my bones
(Neon gravestones try to call)
Neon gravestones try to call
(Neon gravestones try to call)
Neon gravestones try to call for my bones
(Neon gravestones try to call for my bones)

[Bridge 2]
'Cause they won't get them
No, they won't get them
They won't get them
But they won't get them

[Verse 3]
Don't get me wrong, the rise in awareness
Is beating a stigma that no longer scares us
But for sake of discussion, in spirit of fairness
Could we give this some room for a new point of view?
And could it be true that some could be tempted
To use this mistake as a form of aggression?
A form of succession?
A form of a weapon?
Thinking "I'll teach them"
Well, I'm refusing the lesson
It won't resonate in our minds
I'm not disrespecting what was left behind
Just pleading that it does not get glorified
Maybe we swap out what it is that we hold so high
Find your grandparents or someone of age
Pay some respects for the path that they paved
To life, they were dedicated
Now, that should be celebrated[Instrumental Intro]

[Verse 1: Tyler Joseph]
Nobody thinks what I think
Nobody dreams when they blink
Think things on the brink of blasphemy
I'm my own shrink
Think things are after me, my catastrophe
At my kitchen sink
You don't know what that means
Because a kitchen sink to you is not a kitchen sink to me
Okay, friend?
Are you searching for purpose?
Then write something, yeah it might be worthless
Then paint something, and it might be wordless
Pointless curses, nonsense verses
You'll see purpose start to surface
No one else is dealing with your demons, meaning
Maybe defeating them could be the beginning of your meaning, friend

[Chorus: Tyler Joseph]
Go away, go away, go away, go away
Leave me alone, leave me alone, leave me alone, leave me alone
Leave me alone, leave me alone, leave me alone

[Verse 2: Tyler Joseph]
Nobody thinks what you think, no one
Empathy might be on the brink of extinction
They will play a game and say they know what you're going through
And I tried to come up with an artistic way to say they don't know you
And neither do I, so here's a prime example of a stand up guy who
Hates what he believes and loves it at the same time
Here's my brother, and his head's screwed up, but that's all right

[Bridge: Zack Joseph]
Time gains momentum the moment when I'm living in 'em
I'm winning a momentary sinning a moment passing after
A re-beginning moments mending memories
Pretending enemies are frenemies, sending me straight to bending me
My bad behavior but I bet I could have been a better man
Copy and paste caught me, and copy, better rhymes bother me
The better the rhythm the badder I am but I bet I'll battle with 'em battle
Better I am, gambling man, better bet I am a gambling man, I am?

[Chorus: Tyler]
Go away, go away, go away, go away
Leave me alone, leave me alone, leave me alone, leave me alone

[Outro: Tyler]
Leave me alone
Don't leave me alone[Verse 1]
I'm taking over my body, back in control, no more "shotty"
I bet a lot of me was lost,
"T"'s uncrossed and "I"'s undotted
I fought it a lot and it seems a lot like flesh is all I got
Not any more, flesh out the door, SWAT!
I must've forgot, you can't trust me
I'm open a moment and closed when you show it
Before you know it I'm lost at sea
And now that I write and think about it and the story unfolds
You should take my life, you should take my soul

[Chorus]
You are surrounding, all my surroundings
Sounding down the mountain range of my left-side brain
You are surrounding, all my surroundings
Twisting the kaleidoscope behind both of my eyes
And I'll be holding onto you
And I'll be holding onto you

[Verse 2]
Remember the moment you know exactly where you're goin'
'Cause the next moment before you know it
Time is slowin' and it's frozen still
And the windowsill looks really nice, right?
You think twice about your life
It probably happens at night, right?
Fight it, take the pain, ignite it, tie a noose around your mind
Loose enough to breathe fine and tie it to a tree tell it,
"You belong to me, this ain't a noose
This is a leash and I have news for you
You must obey me!"

[Chorus]
You are surrounding, all my surroundings
Sounding down the mountain range of my left-side brain
You are surrounding, all my surroundings
Twisting the kaleidoscope behind both of my eyes

[Bridge A]
Entertain my faith, entertain my faith
Entertain my faith, entertain my faith
Entertain my faith, entertain my faith
Entertain my faith, entertain my faith
Entertain my faith, entertain my faith

[Bridge B]
Lean with it, rock with it, when we gonna stop with it?
Lyrics that mean nothin', we were gifted with thought
Is it time to move our feet, to an introspective beat?
It ain't the speakers that bump hearts
It's our hearts that make the beat
Lean with it, rock with it, when we gonna stop with it?
Lyrics that mean nothin', we were gifted with thought
Is it time to move our feet, to an introspective beat?
It ain't the speakers that bump hearts
It's our hearts that make the beat
Lean with it, rock with it, when we gonna stop with it?
Lyrics that mean nothin', we were gifted with thought
Is it time to move our feet, to an introspective beat?
It ain't the speakers that bump hard
It's our hearts that make the beat
Lean with it, rock with it, when we gonna stop with it?
Lyrics that mean nothin', we were gifted with thought
Is it time to move our feet, to an introspective beat?
It ain't the speakers that bump hearts
And it's our hearts that make the beat

[Outro]
And I'll be holding onto you, and I'll be holding onto you
And I'll be holding onto you, and I'll be holding onto you
And I'll be holding onto you, and I'll be holding onto you
And I'll be holding onto you, and I'll be holding onto you[Intro]
Cover me, oh!

[Chorus]
I can't believe how much I hate
Pressures of a new place roll my way
Jumpsuit, jumpsuit, cover me
Jumpsuit, jumpsuit, cover me
I crumble underneath the weight
Pressures of a new place roll my way
Jumpsuit, jumpsuit, cover me
Jumpsuit, jumpsuit, cover me

[Verse]
Spirits in my room, friend or foe?
Felt it in my youth, feel it when I'm old
Jumpsuit, jumpsuit, cover me
Dusting off my jumpsuit (Cover me)

[Chorus]
I can't believe how much I hate (Cover me, oh)
Pressures of a new place roll my way (Cover me, oh)
Jumpsuit, jumpsuit, cover me (Cover me, oh)
Jumpsuit, jumpsuit, cover me (Cover me, oh)

[Bridge]
I'll be right there
But you'll have to grab my throat and lift me in the air
If you need anyone
I'll stop my plans (I'll stop my plans)
But you'll have to tie me down and then break both my hands
If you need anyone
I'll be right there (I'll be right there)
But you'll have to grab my throat and lift me in the air
(If you need anyone)
If you need anyone (If you need anyone)
If you need anyone (If you need anyone)
If you need anyone

[Chorus]
I can't believe how much I hate
Pressures of a new place roll my way
Jumpsuit, jumpsuit, cover me
Oh, jumpsuit, jumpsuit, cover me, oh!

[Outro]
Jumpsuit, jumpsuit, cover me!
Jumpsuit, jumpsuit, cover me![Intro]
Am I the only one I know
Waging my wars behind my face and above my throat?
Shadows will scream that I'm alone-lone-lone...

[Verse 1]
I-I-I-I've got a migraine
And my pain will range from up, down, and sideways
Thank God it's Friday 'cause Fridays will always be better than Sundays
'Cause Sundays are my suicide days
I don't know why they always seem so dismal
Thunderstorms, clouds, snow, and a slight drizzle
Whether it's the weather or the letters by my bed
Sometimes death seems better than the migraine in my head
Let it be said what the headache represents
It's me defending in suspense
It's me suspended in a defenseless test
Being tested by a ruthless examinant
That's represented best by my depress...ing thoughts
I do not have writer's block, my writer just hates the clock
It will not let me sleep, I guess I'll sleep when I'm dead
And sometimes death seems better than the migraine in my head

[Chorus]
Am I the only one I know
Waging my wars behind my face and above my throat?
Shadows will scream that I'm alone
But I know, we've made it this far... kid

Yeah yeah yeah

[Verse 2]
I am not as fine as I seem, pardon
Me for yelling, I'm telling you green gardens
Are not what's growing in my psyche, it's a different me
A difficult beast, feasting on burnt down trees
Freeze frame, please let me paint a mental picture portrait
Something you won't forget, it's all about my forehead
And how it is a door that holds back contents
That makes Pandora's box contents look non-violent
Behind my eyelids are islands of violence
My mind ship-wrecked, this is the only land my mind could find
I did not know it was such a violent island
Full of tidal waves, suicidal crazed lions
They're trying to eat me, blood running down their chin
And I know that I can fight, or I can let the lion win
I begin to assemble what weapons I can find
'Cause sometimes to stay alive you gotta kill your mind

[Chorus]
Am I the only one I know
Waging my wars behind my face and above my throat
Shadows will scream that I'm alone
But I know, we've made it this far... kid

Ah, yeah
Yeah yeah yeah
Oh, oh
Yeah yeah yeah

[Bridge]
And I will say that we should take a day to break away
From all the pain our brain has made
The game is not played alone
And I will say that we should take a moment and hold it
And keep it frozen and know that life has a hopeful undertone

And I will say that we should take a day to break away
From all the pain our brain has made
The game is not played alone
And I will say that we should take a moment and hold it
And keep it frozen and know that life has a hopeful undertone

[Chorus]
Am I the only one I know, oh
Waging my wars behind my face and above my throat
Shadows will scream that I'm alone
But I know, we've made it this far... kid

[Outro]
Made it this far
Made it this f[Intro]

[Verse 1]
A loser hides behind
A mask of my disguise
And who I am today
Is worse than other times

[Pre-Chorus]
You don't know what I've done
I'm wanted and on the run
I'm wanted and on the run
So I'm takin' this moment to live in the future

[Chorus]
Release me from the present, I'm obsessin', all these questions
Why I'm in denial that they tried this suicidal session
Please use discretion when you're messin' with the message, man
These lyrics aren't for everyone, only few understand

No, no, no, no, no, no (Eh, Eh, Eh, Eh)

You don't know my brain
The way you know my name
You don't know my heart
The way you know my face

You don't know what I've done
I'm wanted and on the run
I'm wanted and on the run
So I'm takin' this moment to live in the future

Release me from the present, I'm obsessin', all these questions
Why I'm in denial that they tried this suicidal session

[Bridge]
Hope you're dead 'cause how could you sleep at a time like this?
People they rhyme like this, we're all impressed by this
They rip it, flip it, but these are just triplets
Wrote this in three minutes, three words to a line
It's just poetry divided, I'm the kind of guy
Who takes every moment he knows he confided in
Music to use it for others to use it
You're dead 'cause how could you sleep at a time like this?
Life is up here but you comment below
When the comments below has become common
Motivation to promote your show's next episode
So your brain knows to keep going even though hope
Is far from this moment
But you and I know it gets better when mornin' finally rears its head
Together we're losers, remember the future
Remember the mornin' is when night is dead

[Chorus]
Release me from the present, I'm obsessin', all these questions
Why I'm in denial that they tried this suicidal session
Please use discretion when you're messin' with the message, man
These lyrics aren't for everyone, only few understand
Please use discretion when you're messin' with the message, man
These lyrics aren't for everyone, only few understand

They say, "Stay in your lane, boy, lane, boy"
But we go where we want to
They think this thing is a highway, highway
But will they be alive tomorrow?

[Verse 1]
They think this thing is a highway
If it was our way, we'd have a tempo change every other time change
'Cause our mind's changed on what we think is good
I wasn't raised in the hood
But I know a thing or two about pain an' darkness
If it wasn't for this music I don't know how I would have fought this
Regardless, all these songs I'm hearin' are so heartless
Don't trust a perfect person an' don't trust a song that's flawless, honest
There's a few songs on this record that feel common
I'm in constant confrontation with what I want an' what is poppin'
In the industry, it seems to me that singles on the radio are currency
My creativity's only free when I'm playin' shows

[Chorus]
They say, "Stay in your lane, boy, lane, boy"
But we go where we want to
They think this thing is a highway, highway
But will they be alive tomorrow?
(Will they be alive tomorrow?)

[Verse 2]
I'm sorry if that question I asked last
Scared you a bit like a Hazmat, in a gas mask if you ask Zack
He's my brother, he likes when I rap fast
But let's backtrack, back to this
Who would you live and die for on that list?
But the problem is, there's another list that exists and no one really wants to think about this
Forget sanity, forget salary, forget vanity, my morality
If you get in between someone I love an' me
You're gonna feel the heat of my cavalry
All these songs I'm hearin' are so heartless
Don't trust a perfect person an' don't trust a song that's flawless

[Chorus]
They say, "Stay in your lane, boy, lane, boy"
But we go where we want to
They think this thing is a highway, highway
But will they be alive tomorrow?
They say, "Stay in your lane, boy, lane, boy"
But we go where we want to
They think this thing is a highway, highway
But will they be alive tomorrow?

[Bridge]
(Will they be alive tomorrow?)
(Will they be alive tomorrow?)
(Will they be alive tomorrow?)
They be alive tomorrow?

[Chorus]
They say, "Stay in your lane, boy, lane, boy"
But we go where we want to
They think this thing is a highway, highway
But will they be alive tomorrow?
They say, "Stay in your lane, boy, lane, boy"
But we go where we want to
They think this thing is a highway, highway
But will they be alive tomorrow?

Need you, tell me
Need you, tell me

[Verse 1]
Panic on the brain, world has gone insane
Things arestartingto get heavy,mm
I can't help but think Ihaven't felt this way
Since I asked you to go steady

[Pre-Chorus]
Wonderin' would you be my little quarantine?
Or is this the way it ends?

[Chorus]
'Cause I told you my level of concern
But you walked by like you never heard
And you could bring down my level of concern
Just need you to tell me we're alright
Tell me we're okay

[Verse 2]
Panic on the brain, Michael's gone insane
Julie starts to make me nervous
I don't really care what they would say
I'm asking you to stay
In my bunker underneath the surface

[Pre-Chorus]
Wonderin' would you be (Would you be)
My little quarantine? (Quarantine)
Or is this the way it ends?

And you could bring down my level of concern
Just need you to tell me we're alright

In a world where you could just lie to me (Need you)
And I'd be okay, we'll be okay (Level of concern)
We're gonna be okay (Just need you to tell me we're alright)

[Verse 1]
When the leader of the bad guys sang
Something soft and soaked in pain
I heard the echo from his secret hideaway
He must've forgot to close his door
As he cranked out those dismal chords
And his four walls declared him insane

[Pre-Chorus]
I found my way
Right time wrong place
As I pled my case

[Chorus]
You're the judge, oh no
Set me free
You're the judge, oh no
Set me free
I know my soul's freezing
Hell's hot for good reason
So please, take me
Nah-nah-nah-nah, ooh-oh
Nah-nah-nah-nah, ooh-oh
Nah-nah-nah-nah, ooh-oh

[Verse 2]
Three lights are lit
But the fourth one's out
I can tell cause it's a bit darker
Than the last night's bout
I forgot about the drought
Of light bulbs in this house
So I head out
Down a route I think is heading south
But I'm not good with directions
And I hide behind my mouth
I'm a pro at imperfections
And I'm best friends with my doubt
And now that my mind's out
And now I hear it clear and loud
I'm thinking
'Wow, I probably should've stayed inside my house.'

[Pre-Chorus]
I found my way
Right time wrong place
As I pled my case

[Chorus]
You're the judge, oh no
Set me free
You're the judge, oh no
Set me free
I know my soul's freezing
Hell's hot for good reason
So please

[Bridge]
I don't know if this song
Is a surrender or a revel
I don't know if this one
Is about me or the devil
I don't know if this song
Is a surrender or a revel
I don't know if this one
Is about me or the devil
Ooooh
Oh! Yeah
Ooooh

[Chorus]
You're the judge, oh no
Set me free, oh no
You're the judge, oh no
Set me free, oh no
I know my soul's freezing
Hell's hot for good reason
So please
Na-na-na-na, ooh-oh
Na-na-na-na, ooh-oh
Na-na-na-na, ooh-oh
Na-na-na-na, ooh-oh

[Outro]
You're the judge, oh no
Set me free
You're the judge, oh no
Set me free
You're the judge, oh no
(Josh Dun!)
Set me free
You're the judge, oh no
Set me free[Verse 1]
I wake up fine and dandy
But then by the time I find it handy
To rip my heart apart and start planning my crash landing
I go up, up, up, up, up to the ceiling
Then I feel my soul start leaving
Like an old man's hair receding
I'm pleading, "Please, oh please!" on my knees repeatedly asking
Why it's got to be like this, Is this living free?
I don't wanna be the one
Be the one who has the sun's blood on my hands, I'll tell the moon
Take this weapon, forged in darkness
Some see a pen, I see a harpoon

[Pre-Chorus]
I'll stay awake cause the dark's not taking prisoners tonight
Why am I not scared in the morning?
I don't hear those voices calling
I must have kicked them out, I must have kicked them out
I swear I heard demons yelling
Those crazy words they were spelling
They told me I was gone, they told me I was gone

[Chorus]
But I tell 'em, why won't you let me go
Do I threaten all your plans? I'm insignificant
Please tell 'em, you have no plans for me
I will set my soul on fire, what have I become?
I'll tell 'em

[Verse 2]
On the eve of a day that's forgotten and fake
As the trees, they await, and clouds anticipate
The start of a day when we put on our face
A mask that portrays that we don't need grace
On the eve of a day that is bigger than us
But we open our eyes, cause we're told that we must
And the trees wave their arms and the clouds try to plead
Desperately yelling, "There's something we need!"
I'm not free, I asked forgiveness three times
Same amount that I denied, I three-time MVP'd this crime
I'm afraid to tell you who I adore
Won't tell you who I'm singing towards
Metaphorically, I'm a whore, and that's denial number four

[Pre-Chorus]
I'll stay awake cause the dark's not taking prisoners tonight
Why am I not scared in the morning?
I don't hear those voices calling
I must have kicked them out, I must have kicked them out
I swear I heard demons yelling
Those crazy words they were spelling
They told me I was gone, they told me I was gone

[Chorus]
But I tell 'em, why won't you let me go
Do I threaten all your plans? I'm insignificant
Please tell 'em, you have no plans for me
I will set my soul on fire, what have I become?

[Outro]
I'll tell 'em, you have no plans for me, I will set my soul on fire
What have I become? I'll tell 'em, I'll tell 'em, I'll tell 'em
I'll tell 'em, please tell 'em, you have no plans for me
I will set my soul on fire, what have I become? I'm sorry[Intro]
Yeah, yeah, yeah!

[Verse 1]
We don't believe what's on TV
Because it's what we want to see
An' what we want we know we can't believe
We have all learned to kill our dreams

[Pre-Chorus]
I need to know
That when I fail you'll still be here, mmm
'Cause if you stick around, I'll sing you pretty sounds
An' we'll make money selling your hair

[Chorus]
I don't care what's in your hair
I just wanna know what's on your mind
I used to say I wanna die before I'm old
But because of you, I might think twice
Yeah, yeah, yeah!
Yeah, yeah, yeah!

[Verse 2]
Alright, second verse
What if my dream does not happen?
Would I just change what I've told my friends?
Don't want to know who I would be
When I wake up from a dreamer's sleep

[Pre-Chorus]
I need to know
That when I fail you'll still be here, oh
'Cause if you stick around, I'll sing you pretty sounds
An' we'll make money selling your hair

[Chorus]
But I don't care what's in your hair
I just wanna know what's on your mind
I used to say I wanna die before I'm old
But because of you, I might think twice
I don't care what's in your hair
I just wanna know what's on your mind
I used to say I wanna die before I'm old
But because of you, I might think twice

[Outro]
Yeah, yeah, yeah!
Oh!

Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Yeah, yeah, yeah![Verse 1]
I am on an island, no one to confide
Eight days straight, eight hours each and not one line
I can feel pressure start to possess my mind
So, I'll take this beat I should delete to exercise

[Chorus]
No, I move slow
I want to stop time
I'll sit here 'til I find the problem
No, I move slow
I want to stop time
I'll sit here 'til I find the problem

[Verse 2]
I've got a pet cheetah down in my basement
I've raised him, and bathed him, and named him Jason
Statham, I've trained him to make me these beats
Now my pet cheetah's quicker in the studio than on his feet
I'ma get mine and get going
I'm showing my faces in just enough places
I'm done with tip-toeing, I'll stay in my room
My house is the one where the vultures are perched on the roof
Get behind me, I bet this nepotistic mindset
Will help us get ours as we're growing
This clique means so much to this dude
It could make him afraid of his music
And be scared to death he could lose it

[Chorus]
No, I move slow
I want to stop time
I'll sit here 'til I find the problem
No, I move slow
I want to stop time
I'll sit here 'til I find the problem

[Interlude]
I'll sit here 'til I
I'll sit here 'til I find the problem, no
I'll sit here 'til I
I'll sit here 'til I find the problem

[Chorus]
No, I move slow
I want to stop time
I'll sit here 'til I find the problem
No, I move slow
I want to stop time
I'll sit here 'til I find the problem

[Bridge]
I can feel pressure start to possess my mind
So I'll take this beat I should delete to exercise

[Outro]
Pet cheetah, cheetah
Pet cheetah, cheetah
Pet cheetah, cheetah
Pet cheetah, cheetah
Pet cheetah, cheetah
Pet cheetah, cheetah
Pet cheetah, cheetah
Pet cheetah, cheetah
Pet cheetah, cheetah
Pet cheetah, cheetah
Pet cheetah, cheetah
Pet cheetah, cheetah[Chorus]
Help me polarize, help me polarize, help me down
Those stairs is where I'll be hidin' all my problems
Help me polarize, help me polarize, help me out
My friends and I, we got a lot of problems

[Verse 1]
You know where I'm coming from
Though I am running to you
All I feel is deny, deny, denial

[Pre-Chorus]
I wanted to be a better brother, better son
Wanted to be a better adversary to the evil I have done
I have none to show to the one I love
But deny, deny, denial

[Chorus]
Help me polarize, help me polarize, help me down
Those stairs is where I'll be hidin' all my problems
Help me polarize, help me polarize, help me out
My friends and I, we got a lot of problems

[Verse 2]
Polarize is taking your disguises
Separating 'em, splitting 'em up from wrong and right
It's deciding where to die and deciding where to fight
Deny, deny, denial

[Pre-Chorus]
I wanted to be a better brother, better son
Wanted to be a better adversary to the evil I have done
I have none to show to the one I love
But deny, deny, denial

[Chorus]
Help me polarize, help me polarize, help me down
Those stairs is where I'll be hidin' all my problems
Help me polarize, help me polarize, help me out
My friends and I, we got a lot of problems

[Bridge]
We have problems
We have problems

[Breakdown]
Domingo en fuego
I think I lost my halo
I don't know where you are
You'll have to come and find me, find me
Domingo en fuego
I think I lost my halo
I don't know where you are
You'll have to come and find me, find me

[Bridge]
We have problems
We have problems

[Chorus]
Help me polarize, help me polarize, help me out
My friends and I have problems
Help me polarize, help me polarize, help me out
My friends and I have problems
Help me polarize, help me polarize, help me out
My friends and I have problems
Help me polarize, help me polarize, help me out
My friends and I have problems, yeah
(We have problems)
Singing out, we're singing out, we're singing out
(We have problems)
Yeah

[Outro]
I wanted to be a better brother, better son
I wanted to be a better brother, better son
I wanted to be a better brother, better son[Chorus]
I could take the high road
But I know that I'm goin' low
I'm a banI'm a bandito
I could take the high road
But I know that I'm goin' low
I'm a banI'm a bandito
I could take the high road
But I know that I'm goin' low
I'm a banI'm a bandito

[Verse 1]
This is the sound we make
When in between two places
Where we used to bleed
And where our blood needs to be

[Chorus]
I could take the high road
But I know that I'm goin' low
I'm a banI'm a bandito
I could take the high road
But I know that I'm goin' low
I'm a banI'm a bandito

[Verse 2]
In City, I feel my spirit is contained
Like neon inside the glass, they form my brain
But I recently discovered it's a heatless fire
Like nicknames they give themselves to uninspire
Begin with bullet, now add fire to the proof
But I'm still not sure if fear's a rival or close relative to truth
Either way it helps to hear these words bounce off of you
The softest echo could be enough for me to make it through

[Bridge]
Folina, Sahlo Folina
Sahlo Folina, Sahlo Folina
I created this world to feel some control
Destroy it if I want
So I sing Sahlo Folina, Sahlo Folina, Sahlo

[Chorus]
I could take the high road
But I know that I'm goin' low (Sahlo)
I'm a banI'm a bandito
I could take the high road
But I know that I'm goin' low
I'm a banI'm a bandito (Sahlo)
I could take the high road
But I know that I'm goin' low (Sahlo)
I'm a banI'm a bandito

[Outro]
I created this world to feel some control
Destroy it if I want
So I sing Sahlo Folina, Sahlo Folina[Verse 1]
You know
I've always been collected, calm and chill
And you know
I never look for conflict for the thrill
But if Im feeling
Someone stepping towards you, can't describe
Just what I'm feeling

[Chorus]
For you, Id go
Step to a dude much bigger than me
For you, I know
I would get messed up, weigh 153
For you
I would get beat to smithereens

[Verse 2]
You know
I'll be in the corner taking notes
And you know
I got your six while you're working votes
But if I'm feeling
Someone stepping towards you, can't describe
Just what I'm feeling

[Chorus]
For you, I'd go
Step to a dude much bigger than me
For you, I know
I would get messed up, weigh 153
For you
I would get beat to smithereens

[Bridge]
(Fight fight fight fight fight)
(I would get beat to)
You know I had to do one
You know I had to do one
You know I had to do one on the record (For you)
You know I had to do one on the record for her like this
You know I had to do one on the record for her like this
You know I had to do one on the record for her like this
You know I had to do one on the record for her

[Refrain]
If I'm feeling
Someone stepping towards you, cant describe
Just what Im feeling

[Outro]
For you, I'd go
Write a slick song just to show you the world
For you, I know
They think its messed up to sell out for your girl
For you, I'd go
Step to a dude much bigger than me
For you, I know
I would get messed up, weigh 153
For you
I would get beat to smithereens[Chorus]
I'm fairly local, I've been around
I've seen the streets you're walkin' down
I'm fairly local, good people now
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh

[Verse 1]
I'm evil to the core, what I shouldn't do I will
They say I'm emotional, what I want to save I'll kill
Is that who I truly am? I truly don't have a chance
Tomorrow I'll keep a beat an' repeat yesterday's dance

[Pre-Chorus]
Yo, this song will never be on the radio
Even if my clique were to pick an' the people were to vote
It's the few, the proud, an' the emotional
Yo, you, bulletproof in black like a funeral
The world around us is burnin' but we're so cold
It's the few, the proud, an' the emotional

[Chorus]
I'm fairly local, I've been around
I've seen the streets you're walkin' down
I'm fairly local, good people now
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh

[Verse 2]
I'm not evil to the core, what I shouldn't do I will fight
I know I'm emotional, what I wanna save I will try
I know who I truly am, I truly do have a chance
Tomorrow I'll switch the beat to avoid yesterday's dance

[Pre-Chorus]
Yo, this song will never be on the radio
Even if my clique were to pick an' the people were to vote
It's the few, the proud, an' the emotional
Yo, you, bulletproof in black like a funeral
The world around us is burnin' but we're so cold
It's the few, the proud, an' the emotional

[Chorus]
I'm fairly local, I've been around
I've seen the streets you're walkin' down
I'm fairly local, good people now
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh

[Instrumental Bridge]

[Chorus]
I'm fairly local, I've been around
I've seen the streets (I've seen the streets) you're walkin' down
I'm fairly local, good people now
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh, yeah
I'm fairly local, good people now
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh, good people now
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh, good people now
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh[Verse 1]
I know what you think in the morning
When the sun shines on the ground
And shows what you have done
It shows where your mind has gone
And you swear to your parents
That it will never happen again
I know, I know-ow-ow what that means, I know-ow-ow-ow-ow

[Chorus]
That you all have guns
And you never put the safety on
And you all have plans
To take it, to take it, don't take it, take it, take it
I'm trying, I'm trying to sleep
I'm trying, I'm trying to sleep
But I can't, but I can't when you all have
Guns for hands, yeah
I'm trying, I'm trying to sleep
I'm trying, I'm trying to sleep
But I can't, but I can't when you all have
Guns for hands, yeah

[Verse 2]
Let's take this a second at a time
Let's take this one song, this one rhyme
Together, let's breathe
Together, to the beat
But there's hope out the window
So that's where we'll go
Let's go outside and all join hands
But until then you'll never understand

[Chorus]
That you all have guns
And you never put the safety on
And you all have plans
To take it, to take it, don't take it, take it, take it
I'm trying, I'm trying to sleep
I'm trying, I'm trying to sleep
But I can't, but I can't when you all have
Guns for hands, yeah

[Bridge]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Whoo!
Da-da-da-da-da...
Da-da-da-da-da...
Da-da-da-da-da, ah uh...
Da-da-da-da-da...

[Verse 3]
We've turned our hands to guns
Traded our thumbs for ammunition
I must forewarn you, of my disorder, or my condition
Cause when the sun sets
It upsets what's left of my invested interest
Interested in putting my fingers to my head
The solution is, I see a whole room of these mutant kids
Fused at the wrist
I simply tell them they should shoot at this
Simply suggest my chest and this confused music, it's
Obviously best for them to turn their guns to a fist

[Outro]
I'm trying, I'm trying to sleep
I'm trying, I'm trying to sleep
But I can't, but I can't when you all have
Guns for hands, yeah
I'm trying, I'm trying to sleep (I'm trying to sleep)
I'm trying, I'm trying to sleep (I'm trying to sleep)
But I can't, but I can't when you all have
Guns for hands, yeah[Verse 1]
Sometimes I feel cold, even paralyzed
My interior world needs to sanitize
I've got to step through or Ill dissipate
I'll record my step through for my basement tapes

[Chorus]
Nice to know my kind will be on my side
I don't believe the hype
And you know youre a terrible sight
But you'll be just fine
Just don't believe the hype

[Verse 2]
Yeah, they might be talking behind your head
Your exterior world can step off instead
It might take some friends and a warmer shirt
But you don't get thick skin without getting burnt

[Chorus]
Nice to know my kind will be on my side
I don't believe the hype
And you know you're a terrible sight
But you'll be just fine
Just don't believe the hype
(Take me with you)

[Bridge]
(Were gonna rely pretty heavily
On technology
And energy
To cover up the fact that were only two people
But I think we can do it)

No, I don't know which way Im going
But I can hear my way around
No, I don't know which way I'm going
But I can hear my way around
No, I don't know which way Im going
But I can hear my way around
No, I don't know which way I'm going
But I can hear my way around
But I can hear my way around

[Chorus]
Nice to know my kind will be on my side
I don't believe the hype
And you know you're a terrible sight
But you'll be just fine
Just don't believe the hype
(Don't believe the hype)
Nice to know my kind will be on my side
I don't believe the hype
And you know you're a terrible sight
But you'll be just fine
Just don't believe the hype
Nice to know my kind will be on my side
I don't believe the hype
And you know you're a terrible sight
But you'll be just fine
Just don't believe the hype[Verse 1]
Scared of my own image, scared of my own immaturity
Scared of my own ceiling, scared I'll die of uncertainty
Fear might be the death of me, fear leads to anxiety
Dont know whats inside of me

[Chorus]
Don't forget abou-bou-bou-bou-bout me
Don't forget abou-bou-bou-bou-bout me
Even when I doubt you (Doubt you)
I'm no good without you, no, no

[Verse 2]
Temperature is dropping, temperature is dropping
I'm not sure if I can see this ever stopping
Shaking hands with the dark parts of my thoughts, no
You are all that Ive got, no

[Chorus]
Don't forget abou-bou-bou-bou-bout me
Don't forget abou-bou-bou-bou-bout me
Even when I doubt you (Doubt you)
I'm no good without you, no, no, no, no, no

[Bridge]
Gnawing on the bishops, claw our way up their system
Repeating simple phrases, someone holy insisted
Want the markings made on my skin
To mean something to me again
Hope you haven't left without me
Hope you haven't left without me, please

[Chorus]
Don't forget abou-bou-bou-bou-bout me
Don't forget abou-bou-bou-bou-bout me
Even when I doubt you (Doubt you)
I'm no good without you, no
Don't forget abou-bou-bou-bou-bout me

No good without you, no, no, no, no, no

Turn away if you could get me a drink
Of water 'cause my lips are chapped and faded
Call my aunt Marie, help her gather all my things
And bury me in all my favorite colors
My sisters and my brothers, still, I will not kiss you
'Cause the hardest part of this is leaving you

[Chorus]
(My sisters and my brothers, still)
I will not kiss you (Kiss you) (Turn away)
Lips are chapped and faded, call my (Call my) (Turn away)
Lips are chapped and faded (Faded)
Kiss you (Kiss you) (Turn away)
Lips are chapped and faded, call my (Call my) (Turn away)
Lips are chapped and faded (Faded)

[Verse 2]
Turn away 'cause I'm awful just to see
And all my hairs abandoned all my body
All my agony know that I will never marry
Baby, I'm just soggy from the chemo
I'm counting down the days to go, this just ain't livin'
And I just hope you know

[Chorus]
I will not kiss you (Kiss you) (Turn away)
Lips are chapped and faded, call my (Call my) (Turn away)
Lips are chapped and faded (Faded)
Kiss you (Kiss you) (Turn away)
Lips are chapped and faded, call my (Call my) (Turn away)
Lips are chapped and faded (Faded)

If you say (If you say)
Goodbye today (Goodbye today)
I'll ask you to be true (I'll ask you to be true)
'Cause the hardest part of this is leaving you
Yes, the hardest part of this...

[Outro]
I will not kiss you (Kiss you, kiss you, kiss you)
Lips are chapped and faded
Call my (Call my, call my, call my, call my)
Lips are chapped and faded (Faded)
Kiss you (Kiss you, kiss you, kiss you)
Lips are chapped and faded
Call my (Call my, call my, call my, call my)
Lips are chapped and faded (Faded)[Verse 1]
She asked me, "Son, when I grow old
Will you buy me a house of gold?
And when your father turns to stone
Will you take care of me?"

[Chorus]
She asked me, "Son, when I grow old
Will you buy me a house of gold?
And when your father turns to stone
Will you take care of me?"
I will make you queen of everything you see
I'll put you on the map
I'll cure you of disease

[Verse 2]
Let's say we up and left this town
And turned our future upside down
We'll make pretend that you and me
Lived ever after happily

[Chorus]
She asked me, "Son, when I grow old
Will you buy me a house of gold?
And when your father turns to stone
Will you take care of me?"
I will make you queen of everything you see
I'll put you on the map
I'll cure you of disease

[Verse 3]
And since we know that dreams are dead
And life turns plans up on their head
I will plan to be a bum
So I just might become someone

[Chorus]
She asked me, "Son, when I grow old
Will you buy me a house of gold?
And when your father turns to stone
Will you take care of me?"
I will make you queen of everything you see
I'll put you on the map
I'll cure you of disease[Verse 1]
I'm tired of tending to this fire
I've used up all I've collected
I have singed my hands
It's glowing, embers barely showing
Proof of life in the shadows
Dancing on my plans

[Chorus]
They know that it's almost
They know that it's almost over
They know that it's almost
They know that it's almost over

[Verse 2]
The burning is so low it's concerning
'Cause they know that when it goes out
It's a glorious gone
It's only time before they show me
Why no one ever comes back
With details from beyond

[Chorus]
They know that it's almost
They know that it's almost over
They know that it's almost
They know that it's almost over

They know that it's almost over

They know that it's almost over

In time, I will leave the city
For now, I will stay alive
In time, I will leave the city
For now, I will stay alive
In time, I will leave the city
For now, I will stay alive
In time, I will leave the city
For now, I will stay alive

[Chorus]
They know that it's almost
They know that it's almost over
They know that it's almost
They know that it's almost over
(They know)
(They know)

[Verse 3]
Last year I needed change of pace
Couldn't take the pace of change
Moving hastily
But this year, though I'm far from home
In Trench I'm not alone
These faces facin' me

[Outro]
They know
They know
What I mean[Verse 1]
I'll keep on tryin, might as well
If you decide all is well
I'll keep on tryin', might as well (Might as well)
If you decide all is well (All is well)

[Pre-Chorus]
Though I am bruised, face of contusions
Know Ill keep movin'
Though I am bruised, face of contusions

Even though its me I abuse
Ill keep on goin' back
Even...

I don't mind at all, lean on my pride
Lean on my pride, I'm a lion
I don't mind at all, lean on my pride
Lean on my pride, I'm a lion
I don't mind at all, lean on my pride
Lean on my pride, I'm a lion
I don't mind at all, lean on my pride
Lean on my pride, I'm a lion

[Pre-Chorus]
Though I am bruised, face of contusions
Know I'll keep movin', know I'll keep movin'

[Chorus]
Rust around the rim, drink it anyway
I cut my lip
Isn't what I want, blood is on my tongue
I cut my lip
I cut my lip

[Outro]
I don't mind at all, lean on my pride
Lean on my pride, I'm a lion
I don't mind at all, lean on my pride
Lean on my pride, I'm a lion[Verse 1]
I don't know why I just feel I'm better off
Stayin' in the same room I was born in
I look outside and see a whole world better off
Without me in it tryin' to transform it

[Chorus]
You are out of my mind, oh
You aren't seein' my side, oh
You waste all this time tryin' to get to me
But you are out of my mind, yeah

[Verse 2]
Listen, I know
This one's a contradiction because of how happy it sounds
But the lyrics are so down
It's okay though
Because it represents, wait, better yet it is
Who I feel I am right now

[Chorus]
You are out of my mind, oh
You aren't seein' my side, oh
You waste all this time tryin' to get to me
But you are out of my mind

[Post-Chorus]
Heard you say, "Not today"
Tore the curtains down, windows open, now make a sound
Heard your voice, "there's no choice"
Tore the curtains down, windows open, now make a noise

[Bridge]
Oh, don't you test me, no
Just because I play the piano
Doesn't mean I, I'm not willin' to take you down
I'm sorry

[Chorus]
I'm, I'm out of my mind, oh
I'm not seein' things right, oh
I waste all this time tryin' to run from you
But I'm, I'm out of my mind

[Post-Chorus]
Heard you say, "Not today"
Tore the curtains down, windows open, now make a sound
Heard your voice, "there's no choice"
Tore the curtains down, windows open, now make a noise

[Bridge 2]
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, yeah, oh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, yeah, oh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

[Chorus]
You are out of my mind
You aren't seein' my side
You waste all this time tryin' to get to me
But you are out of my mind

[Post-Chorus]
Heard you say, "Not today"
Tore the curtains down, windows open, now make a sound
Heard your voice, "there's no choice"
Tore the curtains down, windows open, now make a noise

[Outro]
Buh buh bah, buh buh bah
Bah bah bah bah bah, bah bah bah bah bah
Buh buh bah, buh buh bah
Bah bah bah bah bah, bah bah bah bah bah
Buh buh bah, buh buh bah (Not today)
Bah bah bah bah bah (Not today), bah bah bah bah bah (Not today)
Buh buh bah (No, not today), buh buh bah (Not today)
(Oh nah nah no) Bah bah bah bah bah, bah bah bah bah (No) bah (No)
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh[Hook]
A shadow tilts its head at me
Spirits in the dark are waiting
I will let the wind go quietly
I will let the wind go quietly

[Verse 1]
Be the one, be the one to take my soul and make it undone
Be the one, be the one to take me home and show me the sun
I know, I know you can bring the fire, I can bring the bones
I know, I know you make the fire, my bones will make it grow

[Chorus]
Where we're from, there's no sun, our hometown's in the dark
Where we're from, we're no one, our hometown's in the dark
Our hometown's in the dark

[Hook]
A shadow tilts its head at me
Spirits in the dark are waiting
I will let the wind go quietly
I will let the wind go quietly

[Verse 2]
Put away, put away all the gods your father served today
Put away, put away your traditions, believe me when I say
We don't know, we don't know how to put back the power in our soul
We don't know, we don't know where to find what once was in our bones

[Chorus]
Where we're from, there's no sun, our hometown's in the dark
Where we're from, we're no one, our hometown's in the dark
Our hometown's in the dark

[Hook]
My shadow tilts its head at me
Spirits in the dark are waiting
I will let the wind go quietly
I will let the wind go quietly

[Chorus]
Where we're from, there's no sun, our hometown's in the dark
Where we're from, we're no one, our hometown's in the dark[Chorus]
You were one of those classic ones
Traveling around this sun
You were one of those classic ones
I wish she knew you
You were one of those classic ones
Now everybody knows
You were one of those classic ones, yeah

[Post-Chorus]
Alright
You're a legend in my own mind
My middle name, my goodbye

[Verse]
You were here when I wrote this
But the masters and mixes
Will take too long to finish to show you
I'm sorry I did not visit
Did not know how to take it
When your eyes did not know me
Like I know you

[Chorus]
You were one of those classic ones
Travelin' around this sun
You were one of those classic ones
I wish she knew you (I wish she knew you)
You were one of those classic ones
Now everybody knows (Wish she knew you)
You were one of those classic ones, yeah

[Post-Chorus]
Alright
You're a legend in my own mind
My middle name, my goodbye
Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, oh
Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye
Alright (wish she knew you)
You're a legend in my own mind
My middle name, my goodbye

[Outro]
Then the day that it happened, I recorded this last bit
I look forward to having a lunch with you again[Chorus]
Hello, we haven't talked in quite some time
I know I haven't been the best of sons
Hello, I've been traveling in the deserts of my mind
And I haven't found a drop of life
I haven't found a drop of you
I haven't found a drop
I haven't found a drop of water
Water, oh, oh

[Verse 1]
I try desperately to run through the sand
As I hold the water in the palm of my hand
'Cause it's all that I have and it's all that I need
And the waves of the water mean nothing to me

[Verse 2]
But I try my best and all that I can to
Hold tightly onto what's left in my hand
But no matter how, how tightly I will strain
The sand will slow me down and the water will drain

[Verse 3]
I'm just being dramatic
In fact, I'm only at it again
As an addict with a pen
Who's addicted to the wind

[Verse 4]
As it blows me back and forth
Bindless, spineless, and pretend
Of course I'll be here again
See you tomorrow

[Verse 5]
But it's the end of today
End of my ways as a walking denial
My trial was filed
As a crazy, suicidal head-case

[Verse 6]
But you specialize in dying
You hear me screaming, "Father!"
And I'm lying here just crying
So wash me with your water
Oh, oh, water

[Chorus]
Hello, I haven't talked in quite some time
I know I haven't been the best of sons
Hello, I've been traveling in the deserts of my mind
And I, I haven't found a drop of life
I haven't found a drop of you
I haven't found a drop
I haven't found a drop of water[Verse 1]
I'm a goner, somebody catch my breath
I'm a goner, somebody catch my breath
I wanna be known by you
I wanna be known by you
I'm a goner, somebody catch my breath
I'm a goner, somebody catch my breath
I wanna be known by you
I wanna be known by you

[Chorus]
Though I'm weak and beaten down
I'll slip away into the sound
The ghost of you is close to me
I'm inside out, you're underneath

[Verse 2]
I've got two faces, Blurry's the one I'm not
I've got two faces, Blurry's the one I'm not
I need your help to take him out
I need your help to take him out

[Chorus]
Though I'm weak and beaten down
I'll slip away into this sound
The ghost of you is close to me
I'm inside out, you're underneath
Though I'm weak and beaten down
I'll slip away into this sound
The ghost of you is close to me
I'm inside out, you're underneath

[Bridge]
Don't let me be gone
Don't let me be gone
Don't let me be gone
Don't let me be gone
Don't let me be!
Don't let me be!
Oh, yeah!

[Outro]
I'm a goner, somebody catch my breath
I'm a goner, somebody catch my breath
I wanna be known by you
I wanna be known by you[Verse 1]
I wanna fall inside your ghost
And fill up every hole inside my mind
And I want everyone to know
That I am half a soul divided

[Chorus]
Sometimes, we will die
And sometimes, we will fly away
Either way, you're by my side
Until my dying days
And if I'm not there and I'm far away
I said, "Don't be afraid"
I said, "Don't be afraid
We're going home"

[Verse 2]
I wanna strip myself of breath
A breathless piece of death I've made for you
A mortal rotting piece of song
Will help me carry on
But this you heard

[Chorus]
Oh, sometimes, we will die
And sometimes, we will fly away
Either way, you're by my side
Until my dying days
And if I'm not there and I'm far away
I said, "Don't be afraid
I said, "Don't be afraid
We're going home"

[Bridge]
Oh
Oh
Oh
Oh
Okay

[Verse 3]
So the hearse ran out of gas
A passenger person grabbed a map
And the driver inside it
Contrived a new route to save the past
And checked his watch and grabbed a cab
A beautifully plain taxi cab
A cab, had a cleared out back
And two men started to unpack

[Verse 4]
Driving once again
But now this time, there were three men
And then I heard one of them say
"I know the night will turn to gray
I know the stars will start to fade
When all the darkness fades away
We had to steal him from his fate
So he could see another day."

[Verse 5]
And then I cracked open my box
Someone must have picked the lock
A little light revealed the spot
Where my fingernails had fought
Then I pushed it open more
Pushing up against the door
Then I sat up off the floor
And found the breath I was searching for

[Verse 6]
Then there were three men up front
All I saw were backs of heads
And then I asked them
"Am I alive and well, or am I dreaming dead?"
Then one turned around to say
"We're driving toward the morning sun
Where all your blood is washed away
And all you did will be undone."

[Outro]
I said, "Don't be afraid"
I said, "Don't be afraid"
Oh, oh
