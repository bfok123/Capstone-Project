[Verse 1]
Thought I'd end up with Sean
But he wasn't a match
Wrote some songs about Ricky
Now I listen and laugh
Even almost got married
And for Pete, I'm so thankful
Wish I could say, "Thank you" to Malcolm
'Cause he was an angel

[Pre-Chorus]
One taught me love
One taught me patience
And one taught me pain
Now, I'm so amazing
Say I've loved and I've lost
But that's not what I see
So, look what I got
Look what you taught me
And for that, I say

[Chorus]
Thank you, next 
Thank you, next 
Thank you, next
I'm so fuckin' grateful for my ex
Thank you, next 
Thank you, next 
Thank you, next 
I'm so fuckin'

[Verse 2]
Spend more time with my friends
I ain't worried 'bout nothin'
Plus, I met someone else
We havin' better discussions
I know they say I move on too fast
But this one gon' last
'Cause her name is Ari
And I'm so good with that 

[Pre-Chorus]
She taught me love 
She taught me patience 
How she handles pain 
That shit's amazing 
I've loved and I've lost 
But that's not what I see 
'Cause look what I've found 
Ain't no need for searching, and for that, I say

[Chorus]
Thank you, next 
Thank you, next 
Thank you, next 
I'm so fuckin' grateful for my ex
Thank you, next 
Thank you, next 
Thank you, next 
I'm so fuckin' grateful for my ex

[Post-Chorus]
Thank you, next
Thank you, next
Thank you, next
I'm so fuckin'

[Bridge]
One day I'll walk down the aisle
Holding hands with my mama
I'll be thanking my dad
'Cause she grew from the drama
Only wanna do it once, real bad
Gon' make that shit last
God forbid something happens
Least this song is a smash 

[Pre-Chorus]
I've got so much love 
Got so much patience 
And I've learned from the pain 
I turned out amazing 
Say I've loved and I've lost 
But that's not what I see 
'Cause look what I've found 
Ain't no need for searching
And for that, I say

[Chorus]
Thank you, next 
Thank you, next 
Thank you, next
I'm so fuckin' grateful for my ex
Thank you, next 
Thank you, next 
Thank you, next 
I'm so fuckin' grateful for my ex

[Post-Chorus]
Thank you, next
Thank you, next
Thank you, next
Yeah, yee
Thank you, next
Thank you, next
Thank you, next
Yeah, yee

[Verse 1]
Yeah, breakfast at Tiffany's and bottles of bubbles
Girls with tattoos who like getting in trouble
Lashes and diamonds, ATM machines
Buy myself all of my favorite things 
Been through some bad shit, I should be a sad bitch
Who woulda thought it'd turn me to a savage?
Rather be tied up with calls and not strings
Write my own checks like I write what I sing, yeah 

[Pre-Chorus]
My wrist, stop watchin', my neck is flossy
Make big deposits, my gloss is poppin'
You like my hair? Gee, thanks, just bought it
I see it, I like it, I want it, I got it 

[Chorus]
I want it, I got it, I want it, I got it
I want it, I got it, I want it, I got it
You like my hair? Gee, thanks, just bought it
I see it, I like it, I want it, I got it 

[Verse 2]
Wearing a ring, but ain't gon' be no "Mrs."
Bought matching diamonds for six of my bitches
I'd rather spoil all my friends with my riches
Think retail therapy my new addiction
Whoever said money can't solve your problems
Must not have had enough money to solve 'em
They say, "Which one?" I say, "Nah, I want all of 'em"
Happiness is the same price as red-bottoms

[Pre-Chorus]
My smile is beamin' , my skin is gleamin' 
The way it shine, I know you've seen it 
I bought a crib just for  the closet 
Both his and hers, I want it, I got it, yeah

[Chorus]
I want it, I got it, I want it, I got it
I want it, I got it, I want it, I got it 
You like my hair? Gee, thanks, just bought it 
I see it, I like it, I want it, I got it 

[Verse 3]
Yeah, my receipts be lookin' like phone numbers
If it ain't money, then wrong number
Black card is my business card
The way it be settin' the tone for me
I don't mean to brag, but I be like, "Put it in the bag," yeah
When you see them racks, they stacked up like my ass, yeah
Shoot, go from the store to the booth
Make it all back in one loop, gimme the loot
Never mind, I got the juice
Nothing but net when we shoot
Look at my neck, look at my jet
Ain't got enough money to pay me respect
Ain't no budget when I'm on the set
If I like it, then that's what I get, yeah

[Chorus]
I want it, I got it, I want it, I got it 
I want it, I got it, I want it, I got it 
You like my hair? Gee, thanks, just bought it
I see it, I like it, I want it, I got it 

[Chorus]
You, you love it how I move you
You love it how I touch you, my one
When all is said and done
You'll believe God is a woman
And I, I feel it after midnight
A feelin' that you can't fight, my one
It lingers when we're done
You'll believe God is a woman

[Verse 1]
I don't wanna waste no time, yeah
You ain't got a one-track mind, yeah
Have it any way you like, yeah
And I can tell that you know I know how I want it
Ain't nobody else can relate
Boy, I like that you ain't afraid
Baby, lay me down and let's pray
I'm tellin' you the way I like it, how I want it

[Pre-Chorus]
 And I can be all the things you told me not to be
 When you try to come for me, I keep on flourishing
 And he see the universe when I'm the company
It's all in me

[Chorus]
You, you love it how I move you
You love it how I touch you, my one
When all is said and done
You'll believe God is a woman
And I, I feel it after midnight
A feelin' that you can't fight, my one
It lingers when we're done
You'll believe God is a woman

[Verse 2]

I tell you all the things you should know
So baby, take my hands, save your soul
We can make it last, take it slow, hmm
And I can tell that you know I know how I want it, yeah
But you're different from the rest
And boy, if you confess, you might get blessed
See if you deserve what comes next
I'm tellin' you the way I like it, how I want it

[Pre-Chorus]
 And I can be all the things you told me not to be
 When you try to come for me, I keep on flourishing
 And he see the universe when I'm the company
It's all in me

[Chorus]
You, you love it how I move you
You love it how I touch you, my one
When all is said and done
You'll believe God is a woman
And I, I feel it after midnight
A feelin' that you can't fight, my one
It lingers when we're done
You'll believe God is a woman

[Outro]
Yeah, yeah

Yeah, yeah

My one

When all is said and done
You'll believe God is a woman
You'll believe God

Oh, yeah


It lingers when we're done
You'll believe God is a woman

Some days, things just take
Way too much of my energy
I look up and the whole room's spinning
You take my cares away
I can so over-complicate, people tell me to medicate

[Pre-Chorus]
Feel my blood runnin', swear the sky's fallin'
I know that all this shit's fabricated
Time goes by and I can't control my mind
Don't know what else to try, but you tell me every time

[Chorus]
Just keep breathin' and breathin' and breathin' and breathin'
And oh, I gotta keep, keep on breathin'
Just keep breathin' and breathin' and breathin' and breathin'
And oh, I gotta keep, keep on breathin'

[Verse 2]
Sometimes it's hard to find
Find my way up into the clouds
Tune it out, they can be so loud
You remind me of a time
When things weren't so complicated
All I need is to see your face

[Pre-Chorus]
Feel my blood runnin', swear the sky's fallin'
I know that all this shit's fabricated
Time goes by and I can't control my mind

Usually don't give it away 
But you know I'm out here thinkin' 'bout it

[Pre-Chorus]
Then I realize she's right there
And I'm at home like, "Damn, this ain't fair"

And I never even ever fuckin' met you
Say I'm trippin' and it ain't right
But you without me ain't nice

Step up, the two of us, nobody knows us
Get in the car like, "Skrrt"
Staying up all night, order me pad thai
Then we gon' sleep 'til noon
Me with no makeup, you in the bathtub
Bubbles and bubbly, ooh
This is a pleasure, feel like we never act this regular

[Pre-Chorus]
Click, click, click and post
Drip-drip-dripped in gold
Quick, quick, quick, let's go
Kiss me and take off your clothes

[Chorus]
Imagine a world like that
Imagine a world like that
We go like up 'til I'm 'sleep on your chest
Love how my face fits so good in your neck
Why can't you imagine a world like that?
Imagine a world

[Verse 2]
Knew you were perfect after the first kiss
Took a deep breath like, "Ooh"
Feels like forever, baby, I never thought that it would be you
Tell me your secrets, all of the creep shit
That's how I know it's true
Baby, direct it, name in the credits
Like the movies do

[Pre-Chorus]
Click, click, click and post
Drip-drip-dripped in gold
Quick, quick, quick, let's go
Kiss me and take off your clothes

[Verse 1]
If you take too long to hit me back
I can't promise you how Ill react
But all I can say is at least I'll wait for you
Lately, I've been on a roller coaster
Tryna get a hold of my emotions
But all that I know is I need you close

[Pre-Chorus]
Ima scream and shout for what I love
Passionate, but I don't give no fucks
I admit that I'm a lil' messed up
But I can hide it when I'm all dressed up
I'm obsessive and I love too hard
Good at overthinking with my heart
How you even think it got this far, this far?

[Chorus]
And I can be needy, way too damn needy
I can be needy, tell me how good it feels to be needed
I can be needy, so hard to please me
I know it feels so good to be needed

[Verse 2]
Sorry if I'm up and down a lot 
Sorry that I think I'm not enough
And sorry if I say sorry way too much
You can go ahead and call me selfish 
But after all this damage, I cant help it 
But what you can trust is I need your touch

[Pre-Chorus]
Ima scream and shout for what I love
Passionate, but I don't give no fucks
I admit that Im a lil' messed up
But I can hide it when I'm all dressed up
I'm obsessive and I love too hard
Good at overthinking with my heart
How you even think it got this far, this far?

[Chorus]
And I can be needy, way too damn needy
I can be needy, tell me how good it feels to be needed
I can be needy, so hard to please me
I know it feels so good to be needed

[Intro]

[Verse 1]
I know you hear me when I cry
I try to hold it in at night
While you're sleeping next to me
But it's your arms that I need this time 
Look at the cards that we've been dealt
If you were anybody else
Probably wouldn't last a day
Every tear's a rain parade from hell 

[Pre-Chorus]
Baby, you do it so well
You've been so understanding, you've been so good
And I'm puttin' you through more than one ever should
And I'm hating myself 'cause you don't want to
Admit that it hurts you

[Chorus]
I know that it breaks your heart when I cry again
Over him, mmh
I know that it breaks your heart when I cry again
'Stead of ghostin' him

[Post-Chorus]
We'll get through this, we'll get past this, I'm a girl with
A whole lot of baggage
But I love you, we'll get past this, I'm a girl with
A whole lot of baggage, oh yeah

[Verse 2]
Though I wish he were here instead
Don't want that living in your head
He just comes to visit me
When I'm dreaming every now and then 
And after all that we been through 
There's so much to look forward to
What was done and what was said
Leave it all here in this bed with you 

[Pre-Chorus]
Baby, you do it so well
You've been so understanding, you've been so good
And I'm puttin' you through more than one ever should
And I'm hating myself 'cause you don't want to
Admit that it hurts you, baby

[Chorus]
I know that it breaks your heart when I cry again
Over him, mmh
I know that it breaks your heart when I cry again
'Stead of ghostin' him

[Post-Chorus]

A whole lot of baggage
But I love you , we'll get past this 
I'm a girl with a whole lot of baggage, yeah yeah[Pre-Chorus: Ariana Grande & Pharrell]
When life deals us cards 
Make everything taste like it is salt 
Then you come through like the sweetener you are  
To bring the bitter taste to a halt  

[Chorus: Ariana Grande & Pharrell]
And then you get it, get it, get it, get it 
Hit it, hit it, hit it, hit it

Mix it and mix it and mix it and mix it
Kiss it, kiss it, kiss it
You make me say oh , oh

Somehow your method touches  my soul 
It lifts me up to heights unknown 
So when they ask, "How's life?"  I go

Make everything taste like it is salt

And then we lay it back, talk the rest of the night
Things that we can light make me say oh , oh 
Talking 'bout what you wanna do, whether it's wrong or right
I am followin you 'cause you make me say oh , oh 
 Said I don't know what I'd do without you in my life , it'd be so sour 
I'm hoping that everybody can experience what we have in ours

Make everything taste like it is salt

[Intro: Doug Middlebrook]
Here's the thing: youre in love with a version of a person that you've created in your head, that you are trying to but cannot fix. Uh, the only person you can fix is yourself. I love you, this has gone on way too long. Enough is enough. I'm two blocks away, Im coming over.

[Verse 1: Ariana Grande]
Painted a picture, I thought I knew you well
I got a habit of seeing what isn't there
Caught in the moment, tangled up in your sheets
When you broke my heart, I said you only wanted half of me

[Pre-Chorus: Ariana Grande]
My imagination's too creative
They see demon, I see angel, angel , angel
Without the halo, wingless angel

[Chorus: Ariana Grande]
Falling, falling, but I never thought you'd leave me
Falling, falling, needed something to believe in, oh
I thought you were the one
But it was all in my head
It was all in my head 

[Post-Chorus: Ariana Grande]
Yeah, look at you , boy, I invented you
Your Gucci tennis shoes, runnin' from your issues
Cardio good for the heart 
I figured we could work it out, hmm

[Verse 2: Ariana Grande]
Painted a picture; I thought I drew you well
I had a vision, seeing what isn't there
Caught in the moment, tangled up in your sheets
When you broke my heart, said you only wanted half of me

[Pre-Chorus: Ariana Grande]
My imagination's too creative
They see Cain and I see Abel , Abel , Abel
I know you're able, willin and able

[Chorus: Ariana Grande]
Falling, falling, but I thought that you would need me
Falling, falling, needed something to believe in, oh
I thought you were the one
But it was all in my head
It was all in my head 

[Post-Chorus: Ariana Grande]
Yeah, look at you , boy, I invented you
Your Gucci tennis shoes, runnin from your issues
Cardio good for the heart 
I figured we could work it out, hmm

[Bridge: Ariana Grande]
Wanted you to grow, but, boy, you wasn't budding
Everything you are made you everything you arent
I saw your potential without seein' credentials
Maybe that's the issue 
Said maybe that's the issue, ah
Cant hold that shit against you, ah
Guess I did it to myself, yeah
Thought you were somebody else, you

[Outro]
Thought you were somebody else, you 
Thought you were somebody else, you

[Intro: Shangela Laquifa Wadley]
This is one small step for woman
One giant leap for woman-kind

[Verse 1]
I'd rather be alone tonight
You can say "I love you" through the phone tonight
Really dont wanna be in your arms tonight
I'll just use my covers to stay warm tonight
Think I'm better off here all alone tonight
Aint no checkin' on when I get home tonight
Just makin' sure I'm good on my own tonight
Even though there isn't nothin' wrong tonight

[Pre-Chorus]
Yeah, I'm just sayin', baby
I cant really miss you if Im with you
And when I miss you, it'll change the way I kiss you
Baby, you know time apart is beneficial
Its like I'm the universe and you be N-A-S-A

[Chorus]
Give you the whole world, I'ma need space
I'ma need space, Ima, I'ma need
You know I'm a star; space, I'ma need space
I'ma need space, I'ma, I'ma need space 
Give you the whole world, I'ma need space
I'ma need space, I'ma, I'ma need
You know I'm a star; space, I'ma need space
I'ma need space, I'ma, I'ma need space 

[Verse 2]
Bottom line
Usually, I would love it if you stayed the night
I just think I'm on another page tonight
It ain't nothing wrong with saying I need me time
Usually, I would orbit around you
But gravity seems to be the only thing that's pulling me
You'll be my rise and shine soon as them stars align, mmm

[Pre-Chorus]
Baby, I can't really miss you if I'm with you
And when I miss you, it'll change the way I kiss you
Baby, you know time apart is beneficial
It's like I'm the universe and you be N-A-S-A

[Chorus]
Give you the whole world, I'ma need space
I'ma need space, I'ma, I'ma need
You know I'm a star; space, I'ma need space
I'ma need space, I'ma, I'ma need space 
Give you the whole world, I'ma need space
I'ma need space, I'ma, I'ma need
You know I'm a star; space, I'ma need space
I'ma need space, I'ma, I'ma need space 

[Bridge]
You don't wanna leave me, but I'm tryna self-discover
Keep me in your orbit and you know you'll drag me under
You don't wanna leave me, but I'm tryna self-discover

Keep me in your orbit and you know you'll drag me under


[Outro]
I'd rather be alone tonight
You can say "I love you" through the phone tonight

[Verse 1: Ariana Grande]
Last night, boy, I met you, yeah
When I was asleep 
You're such a dream to me, mmm, woah
And it was on a day like this, yeah
If you can believe, if you can believe 
You're such a dream to me

[Chorus: Ariana Grande]
Before you speak, don't move
'Cause I don't wanna wake up
Wake up, wake up, wake up
Don't wanna wake up, oh
Wake up, wake up, wake up
Boy, you're such a dream
If you can believe, babe
Boy, you're such a dream to me

[Verse 2: Ariana Grande]
"Excuse me, um, I love you"
I know that's not the way to start a conversation, trouble
I watch them other girls when they come and bug you
But I felt like I knew you, so I just wanted to hug you
Plus you don't know your way around
You can stop your playing now
All your worries, lay 'em down, shh, don't say it loud
Is this real, baby?

You're like: "I love youwho starts a conversation like that?" Nobody, but I do
But you are not a picture, I can't cut you up and hide you
I'll get you out my mind, mhm, or try to
But I just want to stand and yell
I will never dare to tell
Think I heard some wedding bells, shh, keep it to yourself
Is this real? 

[Chorus: Ariana Grande]
Before you speak, don't move
'Cause I don't wanna wake up
Wake up, wake up, wake up
Don't wanna wake up, oh no
Wake up, wake up, wake up
'Cause you're such a dream
If you can believe
You're such a dream to me, mmm, boy

[Verse 3: Ariana Grande & Pharrell Williams]
I could buy you anything, but I cannot buy you
Before your boy gets smart, I would never try to
You know I'm thinking to myself, "What happened? Why you?"
But when I see you in my dreams, psh, I know
You know how to treat it, you know how to eat it
You know how to beat it 
The Good Housekeeping Seal

I don't just wanna touch you
I'm tryna turn two single people into a couple
What's your next month like? Tell me what you're up to
We can leave right now, boy, you don't need a duffel
What about La Perla? Let Vickie keep her secret
Boy, it ain't no secret if I know you're gonna peep it, oh

[Chorus: Ariana Grande]
Before you speak, don't move
'Cause I don't wanna wake up
Wake up, wake up, wa-wake up
Wake up, wake up, wake up, wa-wake up

'Cause you're such a dream 
If you can believe, you're such a dream to me
To me, mmm, boy, to me

[Verse 1]
I'm so into you, I can barely breathe
And all I wanna do is to fall in deep
But close ain't close enough, 'til we cross the line, hey yeah
So name a game to play, and I'll roll the dice, hey

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh baby, look what you started
The temperature's rising in here
Is this gonna happen?
Been waiting and waiting for you to make a move
Before I make a move

[Chorus]
So, baby, come light me up, and, baby, I'll let you on it
A little bit dangerous, but, baby, that's how I want it
A little less conversation and a little more touch my body
'Cause I'm so into you, into you, into you
Got everyone watchin' us, so, baby, let's keep this secret
A little bit scandalous, but, baby, don't let them see it
A little less conversation and a little more touch my body
'Cause I'm so into you, into you, into you, oh, yeah

[Verse 2]
This could take some time, hey
Made too many mistakes
Better get this right, right, baby

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, baby, look what you started
The temperature's rising in here
Is this gonna happen?
Been waiting and waiting for you to make a move
Before I make a move

[Chorus]
So, baby, come light me up, and, baby, I'll let you on it
A little bit dangerous, but, baby, that's how I want it
A little less conversation and a little more touch my body
'Cause I'm so into you, into you, into you
Got everyone watchin' us, so, baby, let's keep this secret
A little bit scandalous, but, baby, don't let them see it
A little less conversation and a, little more touch my body
'Cause I'm so into you, into you, into you, oh yeah


[Bridge]
Tell me what you came here for
'Cause I can't, I can't wait no more
I'm on the edge with no control
And I need, I need you to know
You to know, oh

[Chorus]
So, baby, come light me up, and, baby, I'll let you on it
A little bit dangerous, but, baby, that's how I want it
A little less conversation and a little more touch my body
'Cause I'm so into you, into you, into you
Got everyone watchin' us, so, baby, let's keep this secret
A little bit scandalous, but, baby, don't let them see it
A little less conversation and a little more touch my body
'Cause I'm so into you, into you, into you

[Outro]
So come light me up
So come light me up, my baby
Little dangerous
A little dangerous, my boy
A little less conversation and a little more touch my body
'Cause I'm so into you, into you, into you

After laughter comes tears
After laughter comes tears

[Verse 1]
Another night, another party, sayin' hi to everybody
Im sorry, it's time to leave, I gotta leave now
Got somewhere I gotta be now, I'm starving
Can somebody walk me to my car?
If I go alone, Im not gon' make it very far
I'm happy for the love and all of the above
If I'm being honest, I done been through way too much

Hear what they're sayin on the TV, it's crazy
It's gettin' hard for them to shock me
But every now and then, its shocking, don't blame me
I know it's the life that I chose
But baby, I'm grateful, I want you to know
I'm happy for the love and all of the above
If I'm being honest, I done been through way too much

[Pre-Chorus]

If I'm hurt, I ain't gon' lie about it
Arms crossed with the attitude, lips pouted
If I'm mad, I ain't gon' lie about it
Neck roll with the attitude, yuh
If I'm hurt, I ain't gon' lie about it
Arms crossed with the attitude, lips pouted
If I'm mad, I ain't gon' lie about it
Neck roll with the attitude, yuh

[Pre-Chorus]
I can't fake another smile 
I can't fake like I'm alright 
Woo, ah

Fuck a fake smile, smile
Fuck a fake smile, fake smile

Ayo, trophy wife, out, you won me
Until you had to find out it's one me
No-now you benched, aww, your bum knee
Now I'm the bad guy, call me Chun-Li 
'Cause you was slippin', yep, you clumsy
And everything I peeped, can't just unsee
Sips tea, and it's unsweet
Re-respect bad gyal when mi done speak

You don't listen 'cause you know everything
You don't even need dreams
Tellin' everybody, "Stay woke, don't sleep"

[Refrain: Ariana Grande]
Ah, gonna break that shit down
You don't wait, tell 'em wait another round
Ah, guess you're way above it now
And that's your way to love it now

[Pre-Chorus: Ariana Grande]
How can they tell you shit that you've been through?
They are so confused, who cares about their rationale?
If it ain't your view
That's the bottom line
Know-it-all 
Give you a box of chances, every time you blow it all 
As if it were shade, you would just throw it all 
It's like you're trying not to glow at all 
Know-it-all

Why do we have chemistry? 
With a need for speed 
Doin' things that trouble clings  to
And burns off our wings

Tell me why you gotta look at me that way
You know what it does to me
So baby, what you tryna say? Ayy
Lately, all I want is you on top of me
You know where your hands should be
So baby, won't you come show me? Mmm
I got you, I got you dreamin' 
You close your eyes and you're screamin' 
Play with your mind for no reason
I know you love how I tease it 
You know that I'm playin', so don't be mistaken
You already know what I'm thinkin', boy

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, why'd you have to be so cute?
It's impossible to ignore you, woah
Why must you make me laugh so much?
It's bad enough we get along so well

[Chorus]
Just say goodnight and go
Ohh, ohh, ohh
Just say goodnight and go
Ohh, ohh, ohh
Just say goodnight and go

[Bridge]
One of these days
You'll miss your train and come stay with me

We'll have drinks and talk about things
And any excuse to stay awake with you
And you'd sleep here, I'd sleep there
But then the heating may be down again

We'd be good, we'd be great together

[Pre-Chorus]
Why'd you have to be so cute?
It's impossible to ignore you, woah
Why must you make me laugh so much?
It's bad enough we get along so well

Just say goodnight and go
Ohh, ohh, ohh
Just say goodnight and go
Ohh, ohh, ohh

[Post-Chorus]
I know how you want it, baby, just like this
Know you're thinkin' 'bout it, baby, just one kiss
While you're lookin' at 'em, baby, read my lips
I know what you want, but you can't have this

[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]
I say "Girl, you need a hot boy"
She say "you need to stop [censored] with them thots, boy"
I say "You need a real [censored]," she said, "Yes, Lord"
And what you need your ex for? I'm triple X, Lord
Okay, Ariana my lil mama, goodbye to the good girl
My ex tripping, it's no Biggie, I 2Pac shook her
I'm laid up with my new thing, she lay her head on my new chain
Then the mood change, my name change from 'Lil Wayne' to 'Ooh, Wayne,' oh Lord
She grinding on this Grande, oh Lord
I'm drowning, I'm gonna need that coast guard
And when it comes to that [censored], I give her amnesia
She just looking for love, she says she single and I'm her feature
Oh, my God

[Verse 1]
Don't need permission
Made my decision to test my limits
'Cause it's my business, God as my witness
Start what I finished
Don't need no hold up
Taking control of this kind of moment
I'm locked and loaded
Completely focused, my mind is open

[Pre-Chorus]
All that you got
Skin to skin, oh my God
Don't you stop, boy

[Chorus]
Somethin' 'bout you makes me feel like a dangerous woman
Somethin' 'bout, somethin' 'bout, somethin' 'bout you
Makes me wanna do things that I shouldn't
Somethin' 'bout, somethin' 'bout, somethin' 'bout

[Verse 2]
Nothing to prove and I'm bulletproof and
Know what I'm doing
The way we're movin'
Like introducing us to a new thing
I wanna savor, save it for later
The taste, the flavor, 'cause I'm a taker, 'cause I'm a giver
It's only nature, I live for danger

[Pre-Chorus]
All that you got
Skin to skin, oh my God
Don't ya stop, boy 

[Chorus]
Somethin' 'bout you makes me feel like a dangerous woman
Somethin' 'bout, somethin' 'bout, somethin' 'bout you
Makes me wanna do things that I shouldn't
Somethin' 'bout, somethin' 'bout, somethin' 'bout you

Yeah, I'ma call you over here to numb the pain 
I got a bad idea 
Forget about it, yeah, forget about him, yeah
Forget about me 
Yeah 
Forget about it, yeah, forget about him, yeah
Forget about me 

Forget about it, yeah, forget about him, yeah
Forget about me

[Outro]
I got a bad idea
How 'bout we take a little bit of time away?
I got a bad idea
Forget about it, yeah, forget about him, yeah
Forget about me

[Verse 1]
You keep me in your orbit
Well, I know I'm a hard one to please
Give it too much importance
My love will have you fall to your knees
I tell 'em this too often
Know better than to bark up my tree
Just for me to fall and leave
Nah, I'd rather just watch you smoke and drink, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
Steering clear of any headaches to start
And if we're being honest
I'd rather your body than half of your heart
Or jealous-ridden comments
That come when you let in them feelings that I don't want
I never let 'em know too much
Hate gettin' too emotional, yeah

[Chorus]
I'm better off without him
I'm better off being a wild one
On the road a lot, had to keep it a thousand
So that I'm better off not being around ya

[Verse 2]
Go on and face it, I'll never be ready for you, ready for you
I swear my love is a curse, make you head over shoes, head over shoes
Let's put them topics to bed and go fuck on the roof, just to say that we did it
You keep insisting I listen to your proposition
I dismiss 'em all, no offense, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
Steering clear of any headaches to start
And if we're being honest
I'd rather your body than half of your heart
Or jealous-ridden comments
That come when you let in them feelings that I don't want
I never let 'em know too much
Hate gettin' too emotional, yeah

[Chorus]
I'm better off without him
I'm better off being a wild one
On the road a lot, had to keep it a thousand
So that I'm better off not being around ya

[Outro]
I'm better off without him
I'm better off being a wild one
On the road a lot, had to keep it a thousand
So that I'm better off not being around ya

[Verse 1]
I was a liar, I gave in to the fire
I know I should've fought it, at least I'm being honest
Feel like a failure, 'cause I know that I failed you
I should've done you better, 'cause you don't want a liar

[Pre-Chorus]
And I know, and I know, and I know she gives you everything
But boy, I couldn't give it to you
And I know, and I know, and I know that you got everything
But I got nothing here without you

[Chorus]
So one last time
I need to be the one who takes you home
One more time
I promise after that, I'll let you go
Baby, I don't care if you got her in your heart
All I really care is you wake up in my arms
One last time
I need to be the one who takes you home

[Verse 2]
I don't deserve it, I know I don't deserve it
But stay with me a minute, I swear I'll make it worth it
Can't you forgive me? At least just temporarily
I know that this is my fault, I should have been more careful

[Pre-Chorus]
And I know, and I know, and I know she gives you everything
But boy, I couldn't give it to you
And I know, and I know, and I know that you got everything
But I got nothing here without you, baby

[Chorus]
So one last time
I need to be the one who takes you home
One more time
I promise after that, I'll let you go
Baby, I don't care if you got her in your heart
All I really care is you wake up in my arms
One last time
I need to be the one who takes you home

[Bridge]
Yeah, I know I should've fought it
At least I'm being honest, yeah
But stay with me a minute
I swear I'll make it worth it, yeah
'Cause I don't wanna be without you

[Chorus]
So one last time
I need to be the one who takes you home 
One more time
I promise after that, I'll let you go
Baby, I don't care if you got her in your heart, babe
All I really care is you wake up in my arms
One last time
I need to be the one who takes you home, yeah

[Outro]
One last time
I need to be the one who takes you home

[Intro]
You can feel it, feel it


[Verse 1]
They say my system is overloaded

I'm too much in my head, did you notice?

My body's here on Earth, but I'm floatin'

Disconnected, so sometimes, I feel frozen and alone

[Chorus]
This is for everybody
Babe, you gotta take care of your body, yuh yuh yuh
Ain't no time to deny it, that is why we talking about it
Yeah, we talking about it
To deal with it, don't try to get by it
Ain't no time to deny it
So we had to sit down and just write it

[Verse 2]
Want you to get better 
My life is so controlled by the what-ifs

Is there anybody else whose mind does this, mmm?

Down, down, down, down
Is there such a ladder to get above this?



Maybe I should ground myself where the mud is
Before I'm gone

[Chorus]
This is for everybody
Babe, you gotta take care of your body, yuh yuh yuh
Ain't no time to deny it, that is why we talking about it 
Yeah, we talking about it
To deal with it, don't try to get by it 
Ain't no time to deny it 
So we had to sit down and just write it

[Bridge]
You can work your way to the top

Just know that theres up and downs and there's drops

Unfollow fear and just say "You are blocked"

Just know there is so much room at the top


[Refrain]

Well here's one thing you can trust 
It take you and me to make us 
One of those days you had enough , I'll be there

'Cause if it ain't one thing, it's another 
When you need someone to pull you out the bubble 
I'll be right there just to hug you , I'll be there
Where are you? Are you home?

Call me right on the phone 
I'll be there , yeah, I'll be there
I don't care who is gone , you shouldn't be alone 
I'll be there , there

[Bridge]
You can work your way to the top 

(I'm with you, I'm with you, I'm with you, just call me
I'm with you, I'm with you)
Just know that theres up and downs and there's drops

(I'm with you, I'm with you, I'm with you, just call me
I'm with you, I'm with you)
Unfollow fear and just say "you are blocked"

(I'm with you, I'm with you, I'm with you, just call me
I'm with you, I'm with you)
Just know there is so much room at the top

(I'm with you, I'm with you, I'm with you, just call me
No matter the issue)
No matter what, ah, ah, ah

[Refrain]
Here's one thing you can trust, yuh
It take you and me to make us 
One of those days you had enough , I'll be there, I'll be there 
'Cause if it ain't one thing, it's another
If you need someone to pull you out the bubble
I'll be right there just to hug you, I'll be there
Where are you? Are you home? Call me right on the phone
I'll be there, yeah, I'll be there, I'll be there
I don't care who is gone, you shouldn't be alone
I'll be there, ooh, there

[Outro]
You can work your way to the top

Hey baby, even though I hate ya, I wanna love ya

And even though I can't forgive ya, I really want to

Tell me, tell me, baby, why can't you leave me?
'Cause even though I shouldn't want it, I gotta have it

Smart money bettin' I'll be better off without you
In no time I'll be forgettin' all about you
You sayin' that you know, but I really, really doubt you
Understand my life is easy when I ain't around you
Iggy Iggy, too biggie to be here stressin'
I'm thinkin' I love the thought of you more than I love your presence
And the best thing now is probably for you to exit
I let you go, let you back, I finally learned my lesson
No half-steppin', either you want it or you just playin'
I'm listenin' to you knowin' I can't believe what you sayin'
There's a million you's baby boo, so don't be dumb
I got 99 problems but you won't be one, like what

[Bridge: Ariana Grande]

I got one less, one less problem, problem, baby
One less problem without ya

I got one less problem without ya 
I got one less, one less problem, yeah

I like to fuck with you just to make up with you

At the end of the day, boy

[Chorus]
I love it when we make up 
Go head, ruin my makeup 
I love it when we make up 
Go 'head, ruin my makeup 

[Verse 2]
My energy and attitude don't really coincide

Bring you to the bed where we can really make it right
Sorry-in-a-box so when it pops, surprise, surprise

[Chorus]
I love it when we make up 
Go 'head, ruin my makeup 
I love it when we make up 
Go 'head, ruin my makeup 

[Verse 3]
Promise me that when you kiss my lips, you'll make it stick

No eyeliner on, but looking at you is the fix
Highlight of my life, just like that Fenty Beauty kit
Boy, you know what it is

[Chorus]
I love it when we make up 
Go head, ruin my makeup 
I love it when we make up 
Go 'head, ruin my makeup 

[Bridge]
Let me stay in my bag cause I like when you mad

Attitude, dream of mine 
When you say that I'm right 
And I find that it works every time

[Chorus]
And I love it when we make up 

Go 'head, ruin my makeup 

I love it when we make up 

Go 'head, ruin my makeup

Back to you, back to you, back to you
I go back to you, back to you, back to you everytime

[Verse 1]
I get tired of your no-shows
You get tired of my control 
They keep telling me to let go
But I don't really let go when I say so 
I keep giving people blank stares 
I'm so different when you're not there 
It's like something out of Shakespeare
Because I'm really not here when you're not there

[Pre-Chorus]
I've tried to fight our energy
But every time I think I'm free 

[Chorus]
You get high and call on the regular
I get weak and fall like a teenager
Why, oh why does God keep bringing me back to you?
I get drunk, pretend that I'm over it
Self-destruct, show up like an idiot
Why, oh why does God keep bringing me back to you?

[Post-Chorus]
I go back to you, back to you, back to you
Back to you, back to you, back to you
I go back to you, back to you, back to you everytime

[Verse 2]
Just when I get on a new wave 
Boy, you look at me and I slip outta my lace
They keep calling me a head-case
'Cause I can't make a good case why we can't change

[Pre-Chorus]
I've tried to fight our energy 
But every time I think I'm free 

[Chorus]
You get high and call on the regular
I get weak and fall like a teenager
Why, oh why does God keep bringing me  back to you?

I get drunk, pretend that I'm over it
Self-destruct, show up like an idiot
Why, oh why does God keep bringing me back to you?

[Post-Chorus]
I go back to you, back to you, back to you 
Back to you, back to you, back to you 
I go back to you, back to you, back to you everytime

Every look , every touch 
Makes me wanna give you my heart

I never knew, I never knew
You could hold moonlight in your hands
'Til the night I held you
You are my moonlight, moonlight

Puts his lips  on my neck 
Makes me want to give him my body

I never knew, I never knew
You could hold moonlight in your hands
'Til the night I held you

Tryna sit in the back of his whip and just cancel my plans
Sweet like candy, but he's such a man
He knows just what it does when hes holding me tight
And he calls me "moonlight" too

[Verse]
When raindrops fell down from the sky
The day you left me, an angel cried
Oh, she cried
An angel cried, she cried

[Verse 1: Ariana Grande]
How soon do we forget how we felt
Dealing with emotions that never left
Playing with the hand that we were dealt in this game
Maybe I'm the sinner and you're the saint
Gotta stop pretending what we ain't
Why we pointing fingers anyway when we're the same?

[Pre-Chorus: Ariana Grande]
Break up, make up
Total waste of time
Can we please make up our minds and stop acting like were blind? 
'Cause if the water dries up and the moon stops shining
Stars fall, and the world goes blind
Boy, you know I'll be savin' my love for you, for you

[Chorus: Ariana Grande & ]
'Cause you're the best mistake I've ever made
But we hold on, mm, hold on
There's no pot of gold in the rainbows we chase
But we hold on , mm, hold on, eh 

[Verse 2: Big Sean]
I guess time's wasting
Tick-tocking, lip locking
How can we keep the feelings fresh?
How do we zip lock it?
Wear your heart up on your sleeve
So watch out for pickpockets
I guess to go the distance we might need to pit stop it
Hold up, I know love can be a beach with no shore
I done count to ten, lost my temper and went back to four
I know sometimes it's hard to realize I'm the man that you need
I had a dream we branched out, started a family tree, huh
And I feel like that everything we do is overdue
You asked why I love your mom so much, 'cause she's a older you
I wish that you were happy
I guess that's the one thing I should be providing
Ain't no number twos
We both ones of ones, and we the oddest couple
Only humans, 'cept you, you a goddess
Only lying to you when I lie you down, just being honest
When you start as friends, it's hard to say you're never going back
If I'm not the one, then I'm the best mistake you ever had

[Pre-Chorus: Ariana Grande]
Break up, make up
Total waste of time
Can we please make up our minds and stop acting like were blind?
'Cause if the water dries up and the moon stops shining
Stars fall, and the world goes blind
Boy, you know I'll be savin' my love for you, for you

[Chorus: Ariana Grande]
'Cause you're the best mistake I've ever made
But we hold on, mm, hold on
There's no pot of gold in the rainbows we chase
But we hold on, mm, hold on, eh

[Outro: Ariana Grande & Big Sean]
You, you, you, you
I'll be savin' my love for you, for you

You, you, you, you

I'll be savin' my love for you, for you[Click here to read how Zedd and Ariana Grande got together to make Break Free]

[Verse 1]
If you want it, take it
I should've said it before
Tried to hide it, fake it
I can't pretend anymore

[Pre-Chorus]
I only wanna die alive
Never by the hands of a broken heart
I don't wanna hear you lie tonight
Now that I've become who I really am

[Chorus]
This is the part when I say I don't want ya
I'm stronger than I've been before
This is the part when I break free

I'm stronger than I've been before
This is the part when I break free
'Cause I can't resist it no more

You were better, deeper
I was under your spell, yeah
Like a deadly fever, yeah, babe
On the highway to hell, yeah

I don't wanna hear you lie tonight
Now that I've become who I really am

I'm stronger than I've been before
This is the part when I break free
'Cause I can't resist it no more

[Bridge]
No more, baby
Ooh-ooh-ooh
Thought of your body, I came alive
It was lethal, it was fatal
In my dreams, it felt so right
But I woke up every time
Ooh, baby

[Chorus]
This is the part when I say I don't want ya
I'm stronger than I've been before 
This is the part when I break free
'Cause I can't resist it no more
This is  the part when I say I don't want ya
I'm stronger than I've been before
This is the part when I break free
'Cause I can't resist it no more

[Pre-Chorus: Ariana Grande]
You know I'm the wifey type, babe

[Verse 3: Missy Elliott]
Uh, I'm like, you got me so on a chase
Got me feeling so out of place
Think 'bout you all of my days
Wish you'd chew on me like fresh grapes
Not tryna cuff you or crowd your space
I'm tryna find cute words just to say
"Dang, you fine, and look at that face"
At the borderline, beside me, you lay

[Chorus: Ariana Grande]
Baby, I just want you to be mine
Won't you give me a bit of your time? Oh, whoa
Chasin' you, no, I won't stop tryin'
Just meet me at the borderline

[Verse 1]
How do I make the phone ring?
Why do I even care?
How are you all around me, when you're not really there? 
When you're not really there? 
How do I feel you on me, when you're not on my skin?
Why do you say you want me, then tell me you're not coming in?
Ah, yeah, baby, just come on in 

[Chorus]
'Cause every time I'm with you, I go into a zone
And I remember all the places you wanna go
Take me all the way 
Ain't nobody gonna touch it, touch it, touch it
'Cause every time I see you, I don't wanna behave
I'm tired of being patient, so let's pick up the pace
Take me all the way 
Ain't nobody gonna touch it, touch it, touch it

[Verse 2]
How do you know I'm breathing, when I'm holding my breath?
Why don't we face the danger, just for the night and forget? 
Baby, let's just forget 
Remind me why we're taking a break
It's obviously insane
'Cause we both know what we want
So why don't we fall in love?
Baby, let's fall in love, oh-oh

[Chorus]
'Cause every time I'm with you, I go into a zone
And I remember all the places you wanna go
Take me all the way 
Ain't nobody gonna touch it, touch it, touch it
'Cause every time I see you, I don't wanna behave
I'm tired of being patient, so let's pick up the pace
Take me all the way 
Ain't nobody gonna touch it, touch it, touch it

[Refrain]
Oh, ain't nobody gonna, touch it, touch it, touch it
Baby, ain't nobody gonna, touch it, touch it, touch it 
Baby, ain't nobody gonna, touch it, touch it, touch it 
Ain't nobody gonna touch it 

[Bridge]
Remind me why we're taking a break
It's obviously insane
'Cause we both know what we want
So why don't we fall in love?
Baby, let's be in love

[Chorus]
'Cause every time I'm with you 
I go into a zone
And I remember all the places you wanna go 
Take me all the way  
No, ain't nobody gonna touch it, touch it, touch it
 
'Cause every time I see you, I don't wanna behave 
I'm tired of being patient, so let's pick up the pace

Take me all the way  
Ain't nobody gonna touch it, touch it, touch it 

[Outro]

Baby, ain't nobody gonna 
Baby, ain't nobody gonna  
Baby, ain't nobody gonna  

[Verse 1]
Don't you know I'm no good for you?
I've learned to lose you, can't afford to
Tore my shirt to stop you bleedin'
But nothin' ever stops you leavin'

[Chorus]
Quiet when I'm coming home and I'm on my own
I could lie, say I like it like that, like it like that
I could lie, say I like it like that, like it like that

[Verse 2]
Don't you know too much already?
I'll only hurt you if you let me
Call me friend, but keep me closer 
And I'll call you when the party's over

[Chorus]
Quiet when I'm coming home and I'm on my own
And I could lie, say I like it like that, like it like that
Yeah, I could lie, say I like it like that, like it like that

[Bridge]
But nothin' is better sometimes
Once we've both said our goodbyes
Let's just let it go
Let me let you go

[Chorus]
Quiet when I'm coming home and I'm on my own
I could lie, say I like it like that, like it like that
I could lie, say I like it like that, like it like that

[Verse 1]
White shirt now red, my bloody nose
Sleepin', you're on your tippy toes
Creepin' around like no one knows
Think you're so criminal
Bruises on both my knees for you
Don't say thank you or please
I do what I want when I'm wanting to
My soul? So cynical

[Chorus]
So you're a tough guy
Like it really rough guy
Just can't get enough guy
Chest always so puffed guy
I'm that bad type
Make your mama sad type
Make your girlfriend mad tight
Might seduce your dad type
I'm the bad guy
Duh

[Post-Chorus]
I'm the bad guy

[Verse 2]
I like it when you take control
Even if you know that you don't
Own me, I'll let you play the role
I'll be your animal
My mommy likes to sing along with me
But she won't sing this song
If she reads all the lyrics
She'll pity the men I know

[Chorus]
So you're a tough guy
Like it really rough guy
Just can't get enough guy
Chest always so puffed guy
I'm that bad type
Make your mama sad type
Make your girlfriend mad tight
Might seduce your dad type
I'm the bad guy
Duh

[Post-Chorus]
I'm the bad guy, duh
I'm only good at bein' bad, bad

[Bridge]
I like when you get mad
I guess I'm pretty glad that you're alone
You said she's scared of me?
I mean, I don't see what she sees
But maybe it's 'cause I'm wearing your cologne

[Outro]
I'm a bad guy
I'm, I'm a bad guy
Bad guy, bad guy
I'm a bad

[Verse 1]
I had a dream
I got everything I wanted
Not what you'd think
And if I'm bein' honest
Itmight'vebeen a nightmare
Toanyone who might care
Thought I couldfly 
So I stepped off the Golden, mm
Nobody cried 
Nobody even noticed
I saw them standing right there
Kinda thought they might care 

[Pre-Chorus]
I had a dream
I got everything I wanted
But when I wake up, I see
You with me

[Chorus]
And you say, "As long as I'm here, no one can hurt you
Don't wanna lie here, but you can learn to
If I could change the way that you see yourself
You wouldn't wonder why you hear
'They don't deserve you'"

[Verse 2]
I tried to scream
But my head was underwater
They called me weak
Like I'm not just somebody's daughter
Coulda been a nightmare
But it felt like they were right there
And it feels like yesterday was a year ago
But I don't wanna let anybody know
'Cause everybody wants something from me now
And I don't wanna let 'em down

[Pre-Chorus]
I had a dream
I got everything I wanted
But when I wake up, I see
You with me

[Chorus]
And you say, "As long as I'm here, no one can hurt you
Don't wanna lie here, but you can learn to
If I could change the way that you see yourself
You wouldn't wonder why you hear
'They don't deserve you'"

[Outro]
If I knew it all then, would I do it again?
Would I do it again?
If they knew what they said would go straight to my head
What would they say instead?
If I knew it all then, would I do it again?
Would I do it again?
If they knew what they said would go straight to my head
What would they say instead?

[Verse 1]
Don't be that way
Fall apart twice a day
I just wish you could feel what you say
Show, never tell
But I know you too well
Got a mood that you wish you could sell

[Chorus]
If teardrops could be bottled
There'd be swimming pools filled by models
Told "a tight dress is what makes you a whore"
If "I love you" was a promise
Would you break it, if you're honest?
Tell the mirror what you know she's heard before
I don't wanna be you...
Anymore

[Verse 2]
Hands getting cold
Losing feeling is getting old
Was I made from a broken mold?
Hurt, I can't shake
We've made every mistake
Only you know the way that I break

[Chorus]
If teardrops could be bottled
There'd be swimming pools filled by models
Told "a tight dress is what makes you a whore"
If "I love you" was a promise
Would you break it, if you're honest?
Tell the mirror what you know she's heard before
I-I don't wanna be you
I don't wanna be you
I don't wanna be you...
Anymore

[Intro: Mehki Raine]
Billie

[Chorus: Billie Eilish]
What do you want from me? Why don't you run from me?
What are you wondering? What do you know?
Why aren't you scared of me? Why do you care for me?
When we all fall asleep, where do we go?

[Verse 1: Billie Eilish & Mehki Raine]
Come here
Say it, spit it out, what is it exactly
You're payin'? Is the amount cleanin' you out? Am I satisfactory?
Today, I'm thinkin' about the things that are deadly
The way I'm drinkin' you down
Like I wanna drown, like I wanna end me

[Refrain: Billie Eilish]
Step on the glass, staple your tongue 
Bury a friend, try to wake up 
Cannibal class, killing the son 
Bury a friend, I wanna end me

[Pre-Chorus: Billie Eilish]
I wanna end me
I wanna, I wanna, I wanna end me
I wanna, I wanna, I wanna

[Chorus: Billie Eilish]
What do you want from me? Why don't you run from me?
What are you wondering? What do you know?
Why aren't you scared of me? Why do you care for me?
When we all fall asleep, where do we go?

[Verse 2: Billie Eilish & Mehki Raine]
Listen
Keep you in the dark, what had you expected?
Me to make you my art and make you a star
And get you connected?
I'll meet you in the park, I'll be calm and collected
But we knew right from the start that you'd fall apart
'Cause I'm too expensive
It's probably somethin' that shouldn't be said out loud
Honestly, I thought that I would be dead by now 
Calling security, keepin' my head held down
Bury the hatchet or bury a friend right now

[Bridge: Billie Eilish & Mehki Raine]
The debt I owe, gotta sell my soul
'Cause I can't say no, no, I can't say no
Then my limbs all froze and my eyes won't close
And I can't say no, I can't say no
Careful

[Refrain: Billie Eilish]
Step on the glass, staple your tongue 
Bury a friend, try to wake up 
Cannibal class, killing the son 
Bury a friend, I wanna end me

[Pre-Chorus: Billie Eilish]
I wanna end me
I wanna, I wanna, I wanna end me
I wanna, I wanna, I wanna

[Chorus: Billie Eilish]
What do you want from me? Why don't you run from me?
What are you wondering? What do you know?
Why aren't you scared of me? Why do you care for me?
When we all fall asleep, where do we go?

[Verse 1]
It's not true
Tell me Ive been lied to
Crying isn't like you, ooh
What the hell did I do?
Never been the type to
Let someone see right through, ooh

[Chorus]
Maybe won't you take it back?
Say you were tryna make me laugh
And nothing has to change today
You didnt mean to say "I love you"
I love you and I don't want to, ooh

[Verse 2]
Up all night on another red-eye
I wish we never learned to fly
Maybe we should just try
To tell ourselves a good lie
Didn't mean to make you cry

[Chorus]
Maybe won't you take it back?
Say you were tryna make me laugh
And nothing has to change today
You didn't mean to say "I love you"
I love you and I don't want to, ooh

[Bridge]
The smile that you gave me
Even when you felt like dying

[Outro]
We fall apart as it gets dark
I'm in your arms in Central Park
There's nothing you could do or say
I cant escape the way I love you
I dont want to, but I love you, ooh
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh

[Verse 1]
"Baby, I don't feel so good," six words you never understood
"I'll never let you go," five words you'll never say 
I laugh along like nothing's wrong, four days has never felt so long
If three's a crowd and two was us, one slipped away 

[Chorus]
I just wanna make you feel okay
But all you do is look the other way
I can't tell you how much I wish I didn't wanna stay
I just kinda wish you were gay

[Verse 2]
Is there a reason we're not through?
Is there a 12 step just for you?
Our conversation's all in blue
11 "heys" 
Ten fingers tearin' out my hair
Nine times you never made it there
I ate alone at 7, you were six minutes away


[Chorus]
How am I supposed to make you feel okay
When all you do is walk the other way?
I can't tell you how much I wish I didn't wanna stay
I just kinda wish you were gay

[Bridge]
To spare my pride
To give your lack of interest an explanation
Don't say I'm not your type
Just say that I'm not your preferred sexual orientation
I'm so selfish
But you make me feel helpless, yeah
And I can't stand another day
Stand another day

[Chorus]
I just wanna make you feel okay
But all you do is look the other way, hmm
I can't tell you how much I wish I didn't wanna stay
I just kinda wish you were gay
I just kinda wish you were gay
I just kinda wish you were gay

[Verse 1]
I should have known
I'd leave alone
Just goes to show
That the blood you bleed is justtheblood you owe
Wewere a pair
But I saw youthere
Too much to bear
You were my life, but life is far away from fair
Was I stupid to love you?
Was I reckless to help?
Was it obvious to everybody else?

[Chorus]
That I'd fallen for a lie
You were never on my side
Fool me once, fool me twice
Are you death or paradise?
Now you'll never see me cry
There's just no time to die

[Verse 2]
I let it burn
You're no longer my concern, mmm
Faces from my past return
Another lesson yet to learn

[Chorus]
That I'd fallen for a lie
You were never on my side
Fool me once, fool me twice
Are you death or paradise?
Now you'll never see me cry
There's just no time to die

[Refrain]
No time to die, mmm
No time to die, ooh

[Outro]
Fool me once, fool me twice
Are you death or paradise?
Now you'll never see me cry
There's just no time to die

[Verse 1]
I've been watchin' you for some time
Can't stop starin' at those ocean eyes
Burning cities and napalm skies
Fifteen flares inside those ocean eyes
Your ocean eyes

[Chorus]
No fair
You really know how to make me cry
When you give me those ocean eyes
I'm scared
I've never fallen from quite this high
Fallin' into your ocean eyes
Those ocean eyes

[Verse 2]
I've been walkin' through a world gone blind
Can't stop thinkin' of your diamond mind
Careful creature made friends with time
He left her lonely with a diamond mind
And those ocean eyes

[Chorus]
No fair 
You really know how to make me cry
When you give me those ocean eyes 
I'm scared 
I've never fallen from quite this high
Fallin' into your ocean eyes
Those ocean eyes

[Bridge]


Da-da-da-da-da, da-da-da-da-da 
 Da-da-da-da-da-da
Da-da-da 
Mmm 
Mmm 

[Chorus]
No fair
You really know how to make me cry
When you give me those ocean eyes
I'm scared
I've never fallen from quite this high
Fallin' into your ocean eyes
Those ocean eyes

[Verse 1]
Bite my tongue, bide my time
Wearing a warning sign
Wait 'til the world is mine
Visions I vandalize
Cold in my kingdom size
Fell for these ocean eyes

[Chorus]
You should see me in a crown
I'm gonna run this nothing town
Watch me make 'em bow
One by one by one
One by one by
You should see me in a crown
Your silence is my favorite sound
Watch me make 'em bow
One by one by one
One by one by one

[Verse 2]
Count my cards, watch them fall
Blood on a marble wall
I like the way they all scream
Tell me which one is worse
Living or dying first
Sleeping inside a hearse 

[Bridge]
You say, "Come over, baby
I think you're pretty"
I'm okay, I'm not your baby
If you think I'm pretty

[Chorus]
You should see me in a crown
I'm gonna run this nothing town
Watch me make 'em bow
One by one by one
One by one by
You should see me in a crown
Your silence is my favorite sound
Watch me make 'em bow
One by one by one
One by one by one

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
Crown
I'm gonna run this nothing town
Watch me make 'em bow
One by one by one
One by one by
You should see me in a crown 
Your silence is my favorite sound 
Watch me make 'em bow
One by one by one
One by one by one

[Intro]
Mind
Mind

[Verse 1]
Sittin' all alone
Mouth full of gum
In the driveway
My friends aren't far
In the back of my car
Lay their bodies

[Pre-Chorus]
Where's my mind?
Where's my mind?

[Verse 2]
They'll be here pretty soon
Lookin' through my room
For the money
I'm bitin' my nails
I'm too young to go to jail
It's kinda funny

[Pre-Chorus]
Where's my mind?
Where's my mind?
Where's my mind?
Where's my mind?

[Chorus]
Maybe it's in the gutter
Where I left my lover
What an expensive fake
My V is for Vendetta
Thought that I'd feel better
But now I got a bellyache


[Verse 3]
Everything I do
The way I wear my noose
Like a necklace
I wanna make 'em scared
Like I could be anywhere
Like I'm reckless

[Pre-Chorus]
I lost my mind
I don't mind
Where's my mind?
Where's my mind?

[Chorus]
Maybe it's in the gutter
Where I left my lover
What an expensive fake
My V is for Vendetta
Thought that I'd feel better
But now I got a bellyache
(Bellyache, bellyache, bellyache, bellyache
Bellyache, bellyache)
Maybe it's in the gutter
Where I left my lover
What an expensive fake
My V is for Vendetta
Thought that I'd feel better
But now I got a bellyache

[Intro]
My Lucifer is lonely

[Verse 1]
Standing there, killing time
Can't commit to anything but a crime
Peter's on vacation, an open invitation
Animals, evidence
Pearly Gates look more like a picket fence
Once you get inside 'em
Got friends but can't invite them

[Pre-Chorus]
Hills burn in California
My turn to ignore ya
Don't say I didn't warn ya

[Chorus]
All the good girls go to Hell
'Cause even God herself has enemies
And once the water starts to rise
And Heaven's out of sight
She'll want the Devil on her team

[Post-Chorus]
My Lucifer is lonely

[Verse 2]
Look at you needing me
You know I'm not your friend without some greenery
Walk in wearin' fetters
Peter should know better
Your cover up is caving in
Man is such a fool, why are we saving him?
Poisoning themselves now
Begging for our help, wow

[Pre-Chorus]
Hills burn in California
My turn to ignore ya
Don't say I didn't warn ya

[Chorus]
All the good girls go to Hell 
'Cause even God herself  has enemies
And once the water starts to rise 
And Heaven's out of sight
She'll want the Devil on her team

[Post-Chorus]
My Lucifer is lonely
There's nothing left to save now
My god is gonna owe me
There's nothing left to save now

[Outro]
Haha!
I cannot do the snowflake

[Verse 1]
Don't be cautious, don't be kind
You committed, I'm your crime
Push my button anytime
You got your finger on the trigger, but your trigger finger's mine

[Verse 2]
Silver dollar, golden flame
Dirty water, poison rain
Perfect murder, take your aim
I don't belong to anyone, but everybody knows my name

[Pre-Chorus]
By the way, you've been uninvited
'Cause all you say are all the same things I did

[Chorus]
Copycat tryna cop my manner
Watch your back when you can't watch mine
Copycat tryna cop my glamour
Why so sad, bunny? Can't have mine

[Verse 3]
Call me calloused, call me cold
You're italic, I'm in bold
Call me cocky, watch your tone
You better love me, 'cause you're just a clone

[Pre-Chorus]
By the way, you've been uninvited
'Cause all you say are all the same things I did

[Chorus]
Copycat tryna cop my manner
Watch your back when you can't watch mine
Copycat tryna cop my glamour
Why so sad, bunny? Can't have mine

[Bridge]
Mine
I would hate to see you go
Hate to be the one that told you so
You just crossed the line
You've run out of time
I'm so sorry, now you know
Sorry I'm the one that told you so
Sorry, sorry, I'm sorry, sorry
Psych

[Pre-Chorus]
By the way, you've been uninvited
'Cause all you say are all the same things I did

[Chorus]
Copycat tryna cop my manner
Watch your back when you can't watch mine
Copycat tryna cop my glamour
Why so sad, bunny? Can't have mine

[Verse 1]
What is it about them?
I must be missing something
They just keep doing nothing
Too intoxicated to be scared
Better off without them
They're nothing but unstable
Bring ashtrays to the table
And that's about the only thing they share

[Chorus]
I'm in their secondhand smoke
Still just drinking canned Coke
I don't need a Xanny to feel better
On designated drives home
Only one who's not stoned
Don't give me a Xanny, now or ever

[Interlude]
Can you check your Uber rating? Oh my god


[Verse 2]
Wakin' up at sundown 
They're late to every party 
Nobody's ever sorry 
Too inebriated now to dance
Morning as they come down 
Their pretty heads are hurting 
They're awfully bad at learning 
Make the same mistakes, blame circumstance

[Chorus]
I'm in their secondhand smoke
Still just drinking canned Coke
I don't need a Xanny to feel better
On designated drives home
Only one who's not stoned
Don't give me a Xanny, now or ever

[Bridge]
Please don't try to kiss me on the sidewalk
On your cigarette break
I can't afford to love someone
Who isn't dying by mistake in Silver Lake

[Outro]
What is it about them?
I must be missing something
They just keep doin' nothing
Too intoxicated to be scared
Hmm, hmm
Hmm, mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm
Come down
Hurting
Learning

[Intro]
No, Billy, I haven't done that dance since my wife died
Theres a whole crowd of people out there who need to learn how to do The Scarn

[Verse 1]
Don't ask questions you don't wanna know
Learned my lesson way too long ago
To be talkin to you, belladonna
Shoulda taken a break, not an Oxford comma
Take what I want when I wanna
And I want ya

[Pre-Chorus]
Bad, bad news
One of us is gonna lose
I'm the powder, you're the fuse
Just add some friction

[Chorus]
You are my strange addiction
You are my strange addiction
My doctors can't explain
My symptoms or my pain
But you are my strange addiction

[Interlude]
I'm really, really sorry, I think I was just relieved
To see that Michael Scarn got his confidence back
Yeah, Michael, the movie is amazing
It's like, one of the best movies I've ever seen in my life

[Verse 2]
Deadly fever, please don't ever break
Be my reliever cause I dont self medicate
And it burns like a gin and I like it
Put your lips on my skin and you might ignite it
Hurts, but I know how to hide it, kinda like it 

[Pre-Chorus]
Bad, bad news
One of us is gonna lose
I'm the powder, youre the fuse
Just add some friction

[Chorus]
You are my strange addiction
You are my strange addiction
My doctors can't explain
My symptoms or my pain
But you are my strange addiction

[Bridge]
Bite my glass, set myself on fire
Can't you tell I'm crass? Cant you tell I'm wired?
Tell me nothing lasts, like I don't know
You could kiss my asking about my motto

[Interlude]
You should enter it in festivals or carnivals
Thoughts? Pretty good reaction
Pretty cool... right?

[Chorus]
You are my strange addiction
You are my strange addiction
My doctors can't explain
My symptoms or my pain
But you are my strange addiction

[Outro]
Did you like it? Did you like that?
Um, which part?

[Verse 1]
Take me to the rooftop
I wanna see the world when I stop breathing
Turnin' blue
Tell me love is endless, don't be so pretentious
Leave me like you do 

[Pre-Chorus]
If you need me, wanna see me
Better hurry 'cause I'm leavin' soon

[Chorus]
Sorry can't save me now
Sorry I don't know how
Sorry there's no way out 
But down
Hmm, down

[Verse 2]
Taste me, the salty tears on my cheek
That's what a year-long headache does to you
I'm not okay, I feel so scattered
Don't say I'm all that matters
Leave me, dj vu 

[Pre-Chorus]
If you need me, wanna see me
You better hurry, I'm leavin' soon

[Chorus]
Sorry can't save me now 
Sorry I don't know how 
Sorry there's no way out 
But down
Hmm, down

[Outro]
Call my friends and tell them that I love them
And I'll miss them
But I'm not sorry
Call my friends and tell them that I love them
And I'll miss them
Sorry

[Verse 1]
Lips meet teeth and tongue
My heart skips eight beats at once
If we were meant to be, we would have been by now
See what you wanna see, but all I see is him right now

[Chorus]
I'll sit and watch your car burn
With the fire that you started in me
But you never came back to ask it out
Go ahead and watch my heart burn
With the fire that you started in me
But I'll never let you back to put it out

[Verse 2]
Your love feels so fake
And my demands aren't high to make
If I could get to sleep, I would have slept by now
Your lies will never keep, I think you need to blow 'em out

[Chorus]
I'll sit and watch your car burn
With the fire that you started in me
But you never came back to ask it out
Go ahead and watch my heart burn
With the fire that you started in me
But I'll never let you back to put it out

[Bridge]
When you call my name
Do you think I'll come runnin'?
You never did the same
So good at givin' me nothin'
When you close your eyes, do you picture me?
When you fantasize, am I your fantasy?
Now you know
Now I'm free

[Chorus]
I'll sit and watch your car burn
With the fire that you started in me
But you never came back to ask it out
Watch my heart burn
With the fire that you started in me
But I'll never let you back to put it out

[Outro]
Never let you back
Let you back, let you back
Never gonna let you back
Let you back

[Verse 1]
Told you not to worry
But maybe that's a lie
Honey, what's your hurry?
Won't you stay inside?
Remember not to get too close to stars
They're never gonna give you love like ours

[Chorus]
Where did you go?
I should know, but it's cold
And I don't wanna be lonely
So show me the way home
I can't lose another life

[Refrain]
Hurry, I'm worried

[Verse 2]
The world's a little blurry
Or maybe it's my eyes
The friends I've had to bury
They keep me up at night
Said I couldn't love someone
'Cause I might break
If you're gonna die, not by mistake

[Chorus]
So, where did you go?
I should know, but it's cold
And I don't wanna be lonely
So tell me you'll come home
Even if it's just a lie

[Bridge]
I tried not to upset you
Let you rescue me the day I met you
I just wanted to protect you
But now I'll never get to

[Refrain]
Hurry, I'm worried

[Outro]
Where did you go?
I should know, but it's cold
And I don't wanna be lonely
Was hoping you'd come home
I don't care if it's a lie

[Intro]

Ba-ba-da, ba-ba-da-ba-da
Mmm, mmm

[Verse 1]
My boy's bein' sus, he was shady enough
But now he's just a shadow
My boy loves his friends like I love my split ends
And by that, I mean he cuts 'em off


[Chorus]
My boy, my boy, my boy
Don't love me like he promised
My boy, my boy, my boy
He ain't a man and sure as hell ain't honest

[Verse 2]
My boy's bein' sus and he don't know how to cuss
He just sounds like he's tryna be his father 
My boy's an ugly crier but he's such a pretty liar
And by that, I mean he said he'd change

[Chorus]
My boy, my boy, my boy
Don't love me like he promised
My boy, my boy, my boy
He ain't a man and sure as hell ain't honest

[Bridge]
My boy, my-my boy, my friends
I love-love, I-I love-love my split ends
My boy 
My-my boy 
My boy, my 


[Chorus]
My boy, my boy, my boy
Don't love me like he promised
My boy, my boy, my boy
He ain't a man and sure as hell ain't honest

[Outro]
You want me to be yours? Well, then you gotta be mine
And if you want a good girl, then goodbye
You want me to be yours? Well, then you gotta be mine
And if you want a good girl, then goodbye

[Verse 1]
Help, I lost myself again
But I remember you
Don't come back
It won't end well
But I wish you'd tell me to

[Chorus]
Our love is six feet under
I can't help but wonder
If our grave was watered by the rain
Would roses bloom?
Could roses bloom
Again?

[Verse 2]
Retrace my lips
Erase your touch
It's all too much for me
Blow away
Like smoke in air
How can you die carelessly?

[Chorus]
Our love is six feet under
I can't help but wonder
If our grave was watered by the rain
Would roses bloom?
Could roses bloom?

[Bridge]
They're playin' our sound
Layin' us down tonight
And all of these clouds
Crying us back to life
But you're cold as a night

[Chorus]
Six feet under
I can't help but wonder
If our grave was watered by the rain
Bloom
Bloom
Again

[Outro]
Help, I lost myself again
But I remember you

[Verse 1]
I wanna be alone
Alone with you, does that make sense?
I wanna steal your soul
And hide you in my treasure chest
I don't know what to do
To do with your kiss on my neck
I don't know what feels true
But this feels right, so stay a sec
Yeah, you feel right, so stay a sec

[Chorus]
And let me crawl inside your veins
I'll build a wall, give you a ball and chain
It's not like me to be so mean, you're all I wanted
Just let me hold you
Like a hostage

[Verse 2]
Gold on your fingertips
Fingertips against my cheek
Gold leaf across your lips
Kiss me until I can't speak
Gold chain beneath your shirt
The shirt that you let me wear home
Gold's fake and real love hurts
But nothing hurts when I'm alone
When you're with me and we're alone

[Chorus]
And let me crawl inside your veins
I'll build a wall, give you a ball and chain
It's not like me to be so mean, you're all I wanted
Just let me hold you
Hold you
Like a hostage
Like a hostage

[Intro]
Hmm-mm

[Verse 1]
Wake up and smell the coffee
Is your cup half full or empty?
When we talk, you say it softly
But I love it when you're awfully quiet
Hmm-mm, quiet
Hmm-mm

[Pre-Chorus]
You see the piece of paper
Could be a little greater
Show me what you could make her
You'll never know until you try it
Hmm-mm
And you don't have to keep it quiet

[Chorus]
And I know it makes you nervous
But I promise you, it's worth it
To show 'em everything you kept inside
Don't hide, don't hide
Too shy to say, but I hope you stay
Don't hide away
Come out and play

[Verse 2]
Look up, out of your window
See snow, won't let it in though
Leave home, feel the wind blow
'Cause it's colder here inside in silence
And you don't have to keep it quiet

[Chorus]
Yeah, I know it makes you nervous
But I promise you, it's worth it
To show 'em everything you kept inside
Don't hide, don't hide
Too shy to say but I hope you stay
Don't hide away
Come out and play

[Chorus]
You can pretend you don't miss me 
You can pretend you don't care
All you wanna do is kiss me 
Oh, what a shame, I'm not there
You can pretend you don't miss me 
You can pretend you don't care
All you wanna do is kiss me 
Well, what a shame, I'm not there

[Verse 1]
What is it you want?
You can lie, but I know that you're not fine
Every time you talk
It's all 'bout me, but you swear I'm not on your mind

[Chorus]
You can pretend you don't miss me 
You can pretend you don't care
All you wanna do is kiss me 
Oh, what a shame, I'm not there

[Verse 2]
Everybody knows
You and I are suicide and stolen art 
Pretty mama sews
Stitches into all your bitches broken hearts

[Chorus]
You can pretend you don't miss me 
You can pretend you don't care
All you wanna do is kiss me 
Oh, what a shame, I'm not there

[Bridge]
Somebody new is gonna comfort you
Like you want me to
Somebody new is gonna comfort me
Like you never do

[Outro]
Every now and then, it hits me
That I'm the one that got away
But I guess being lonely fits me
And you were made for begging, "stay"

[Verse 1]
Wait a minute, let me finish
I know you don't care
But can you listen?
I came committed, guess I overdid it
Wore my heart out on a chain
Around my neck, but now it's missin', hmm

[Refrain]
Da-da-da-da-da-da 
Da-da-da-da-da-da-da 
Oh, hmm, hmm

[Chorus]
So I think I better go
I never really know how to please you
You're lookin' at me like I'm see-through
I guess I'm gonna go
I just never know how you feel
Do you even feel anything?

[Refrain]
Da-da-da-da-da-da-da
Da-da-da-da-da-da-da
Oh, hmm, hmm

[Verse 2]
You said, "Don't treat me badly"
But you said it so sadly
So I did the best I could
Not thinkin' you would have left me gladly
I know you're not sorry
Why should you be?
'Cause who am I to be in love
When your love never is for me?
Me

[Refrain]
Da-da-da-da-da-da-da 
Da-da-da-da-da-da-da 
Oh, hmm, hmm

[Chorus]
So I think I better go
I never really know how to please you
You're lookin' at me like I'm see-through
I guess I'm gonna go
I just never know how you feel
Do you even feel anything?

[Intro]
Hey, leave a message

[Verse 1]
Hey, call me back when ya get this
Or when you've got a minute
We really need to talk
Wait, you know what?
Maybe just forget it
'Cause by the time you get this
Your number might be blocked

[Pre-Chorus]
"Stay" and "blah blah blah"
You just want what you can't have
No way
I'll call the cops
If you don't stop, I'll call your dad

[Chorus]
And I hate to do this to you on your birthday
Happy birthday, by the way
"It's not you, it's me" and all that other bullshit
You know that's bullshit
Don'tcha, babe?
I'm not your party favor

[Verse 2]
Look, now I know we coulda done it better
But we can't change the weather
When the weather's come and gone
Books don't make sense if you read 'em backwards
You'll single out the wrong words
Like you mishear all my songs

[Pre-Chorus]
You'll hear "stay" and "blah blah blah"
You just want what you can't have
No way
I'll call the cops
If you don't stop, I'll call your dad

[Chorus]
And I hate to do this to you on your birthday
Happy birthday by the way
"It's not you, it's me" and all that other bullshit
You know that's bullshit
Don'tcha, babe?
I'm not your party favor

[Intro]
Please, please
Don't leave me
Be

[Verse]
It's not true
Take me to the rooftop
Told you not to worry
What do you want from me?
Don't ask questions
Wait a minute
Don't you know I'm no good for you?
Baby, I don't feel so good
And all the good girls go to Hell
Bite my tongue, bide my time
What is it about them?
I'm the bad guy

[Verse 1]
Our time is up
Your eyes are shut
I won't get to tell you what
I needed you to know
It's dark enough
The moonlight doesn't show
And all my love
Could never bring you home

[Chorus]
There's no more stars to find
And I'm too far behind
And I'd love to let you go
I'd love to let you go
You're all that's on my mind
I called a thousand times
And I have to let you go
But I love you more and more than you could know

[Verse 2]
I sat alone
Awaited your reply
Was driven home
When I started to cry
I should've known
I should've said goodbye
I only hoped
I would've had more time

[Chorus]
There's no more stars to find
And I'm too far behind
And I'd love to let you go
I'd love to let you go
You're always on my mind
When I called a thousand times
And I have to let you go
But I love you more and more than you could know-oh

[Bridge]
Oh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh
Da-da-da-da-da, da-da-ra-da
We're both too young
To live and die this way
A sunny summer day
With so much left to say
Not 21
The 18th out of pain
The day you couldn't stay
You made me wanna pray
But I think God's fake

[Chorus]
There's no more stars to find
And I'm too far behind
And I'd love to let you go
I'd love to let you go
You're all that's on my mind
When I called a thousand times
And I have to let you go
But I love you more and more and more and more and more
More and more, more and more and more than you will ever know
You will never know
You will never know

[Intro]
Aah
Aah

[Verse 1]
The games you played were never fun
You'd say you'd stay but then you'd run
Aah

[Pre-Chorus]
Giving you what you're begging for
Giving you what you say I need
I don't want any settled scores
I just want you to set me free
Giving you what you're begging for
Giving you what you say I need, say I need

[Chorus]
I'm not afraid anymore
What makes you sure you're all I need? 
Forget about it
When you walk out the door and leave me torn
You're teaching me to live without it
Bored, I'm so bored, I'm so bored, so bored

[Verse 2]
I'm home alone, you're God-knows-where
I hope you don't think that shit's fair

[Pre-Chorus]
Giving you all you want and more
Giving you every piece of me
I don't want love I can't afford
I just want you to love for free
Can't you see that I'm getting bored?
Giving you every piece of me, piece of me

[Chorus]
I'm not afraid anymore
What makes you sure you're all I need?
Forget about it
When you walk out the door and leave me torn
You're teaching me to live without it
Bored, I'm so bored, I'm so bored, so bored

[Pre-Chorus]
Giving you what you're begging for
Giving you what you say I need
I don't want any settled scores
I just want you to set me free
Giving you what you're begging for
Giving you what you say I need, say I need

[Chorus]
I'm not afraid anymore
What makes you sure you're all I need?
Forget about it
And when you walk out the door and leave me torn
You're teaching me to live without it

[Verse 1: Billie Eilish]
I've been watching you for some time
Can't stop staring at those ocean eyes
Burning cities and napalm skies
Fifteen flares inside those ocean eyes
Your ocean eyes

[Chorus: Billie Eilish]
No fair
You really know how to make me cry
When you give me those ocean eyes
I'm scared
I've never fallen from quite this high
Falling into your ocean eyes
Those ocean eyes

[Verse 2: blackbear]
Yeah, yeah-eah-eah
I ain't really trippin' if you wanna go
I know I made you cry last year when I was on the road
I meant it when I said it, you can always hit my phone
 267-9932, girl you know-ow-ow
I'ma make this fetty, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
I never would forget you, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Look me in my eyes, tell me you ain't a part of me, no fair

[Chorus: Billie Eilish & blackbear & Both]
No fair 
You really know how to make me cry
When you give me those ocean eyes
I'm scared 
I've never fallen from quite this high
Falling into your ocean eyes
Those ocean eyes 
No fair 
You really know how to make me cry 
When you give me those ocean eyes 
I'm scared 
I've never fallen from quite this high
Falling into your ocean eyes

[Outro: Billie Eilish]
No fair
You really know how to make me cry
When you give me those ocean eyes
I'm scared
I've never fallen from quite this high
Falling into your ocean eyes
Those ocean eyes

[Chorus]
When I was older
I was a sailor on an open sea
But now I'm underwater
And my skin is paler than it should ever be
Hmm

[Verse]
I'm on my back again
Dreaming of a time and place
Where you and I remain the best of friends
Even after all this ends
Can we pretend?
I'm on my, I'm on my back again
It's seeming more and more
Like all we ever do is see how far it bends
Before it breaks in half and then
We bend it back again

[Pre-Chorus]
Guess I got caught in the middle of it
Yes I've been taught, got a little of it
In my blood, in my blood
Memories burn like a forest fire
Heavy rain turns any funeral pyre to mud
In the flood

[Chorus]
When I was older
I was a sailor on an open sea
But now I'm underwater
And my skin is paler than it should ever be

[Bridge]
I'm watching movies back to back in black and white, I never
Seen anybody do it like I do it any better
Been goin' over you, I'm overdue for new endeavors
Nobody lonely like I'm lonely and I don't know whether
You'd really like it in the limelight
You'd sympathize with all the bad guys
I'm still a victim in my own right
But I'm the villain in my own eyes, yeah

[Outro]
When I was older
I was a sailor on an open sea

[Verse 1: Billie Eilish]
I've been watching you
For some time
Can't stop staring
At those oceans eyes
Burning cities
And napalm skies
Fifteen flares inside those ocean eyes
Your ocean eyes

[Chorus: Billie Eilish]
No fair
You really know how to make me cry
When you give me those ocean eyes
I'm scared
I've never fallen from quite this high
Falling into your ocean eyes
Those ocean eyes

[Chorus: Billie Eilish & Astronomyy]
No fair
You really know how to make me cry
When you give me those ocean eyes
I'm scared
I've never fallen from quite this high
Falling into your ocean eyes
Those ocean eyes

[Verse 2: Billie Eilish]
I've been walking through
A world gone blind
Can't stop thinking of your diamond mind
Careful creature
Made friends with time
He left her lonely with a diamond mind
And those ocean eyes

[Chorus: Billie Eilish]
No fair
You really know how to make me cry
When you give me those ocean eyes
I'm scared
I've never fallen from quite this high
Falling into your ocean eyes
Those ocean eyes

[Chorus: Billie Eilish & Astronomyy]
No fair
You really know how to make me cry
When you give me those ocean eyes
I'm scared
I've never fallen from quite this high
Falling into your ocean eyes
Those ocean eyes
No fair
You really know how to make me cry
When you give me those ocean eyes
I'm scared
I've never fallen from quite this high
Falling into your ocean eyes
Those ocean eyes

[Chorus: Billie Eilish]
No fair
You really know how to make me cry
When you give me those ocean eyes
I'm scared
I've never fallen from quite this high
Falling into your ocean eyes
Those ocean eyes

[Verse 1]
Breathe the air again, it's a beautiful day
I wish this moment would stay with the Earth
Some primal paradise
There you go again, saying everything ends
Saying you can't depend on anything, or anyone

[Chorus]
If the end of the world was near
Where would you choose to be?
If there was five more minutes of air
Would you panic and hide
Or run for your life
Or stand here and spend them with me
If we had five more minutes
Would I, could I, make you happy?

[Verse 2]
And we would live again
In the simplest of ways
Living day after day
Like some primal animals
We would love again
Under glorious suns
With the freedom that comes with the truth

[Chorus]
If the end of the world was near
Where would you choose to be?
If there was five more minutes of air
Would you panic and hide?
Or run for your life?
Or stand here and spend them with me?
If we had five more minutes
Would I, could I, make you happy?

[Bridge]
So it finally came to pass
I saw the end of the world
I saw the madness unfold like
Some primal barrier
And I looked back upon
Armageddon
And the moment of truth
Between you and me

[Outro]
If we had five more minutes of air to breathe
And we cried all through it
But you spent them with me
On our last few drags of air we agree
I was and you were happy[Spoken: Billie Eilish & FINNEAS]
My Invisalign has finally...
I have taken out my Invisalign
I have taken out my Invisalign, and this is the album
Hahahahahahahahahahaha, ahh

[Verse 1]
In the end, when they're all gone
When the world is silent and the days are long
Just you and I, we'll be alive
We made it on our own

[Chorus]
'Cause everybody makes it 'till they don't
And everybody wants to think they won't
'Cause everybody makes it 'till they don't
And everybody seems to think they won't, they won't, they won't, they won't

[Verse 2]
Baby, I'm still alive but my heart is beating slow
Baby, tell me I gotta know
Are you okay? You seem too far gone
Infected, standing there all alone

[Chorus]
'Cause everybody makes it 'till they don't
And everybody wants to think they won't
And everybody makes it 'till they don't
And everybody seems to think they won't, they won't, they won't, they won't

[Post-Chorus]
The best of me, the best of me is you
The best of me, the best of me was you

[Outro]
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
Ladum, badum, mmmm

[Verse 1]
Another story of girl meets boy, and gets destroyed, uh, oh
Another promise broken in two, the lucky view of fiction

[Pre-Chorus]
Fade away, fade away
Teach me how to fade away
Another story of girl meets boy

[Chorus]
He's okay, she's broken
He's the ocean waves, she's chokin'
Fade away, fade away
Teach me how to fade away
Another story of girl meets boy

[Verse 2]
So picture perfect, it can't be real and all you feel is numb
You see them talking but hear no sound to hit the ground
And fade

[Chorus ]
He's okay, she's broken
He's the ocean waves, she's chokin'

[Outro]
Don't want it, don't need it
Don't want it
Don't want it, don't need it
Don't want it
Don't want it, don't need it
Don't want it
Don't need it, don't, don't need it
Don't need it, don't, don't need it
Don't need it, don't, don't need it

[Verse 1]
I'm not crying on the phone when you call
What's the use in begging you to stay?
I'm not trying to save us anymore
Cut me loose, 'cause you're too far away

[Chorus]
To make me feel better, make it alright
To give me your sweater, hold my hand tight
Seven days in limbo, push me out the window
Nothing in common, nothing to lose
Nothing but problems between me and you
With your arms akimbo, seven days in limbo
Seven days

[Verse 2]
I'll give all my weapons to you
We've said it all, no more bones to break
I'm done thinking that we might just spark enough
We're broken glass waiting to be washed away

[Chorus]
Can't make me feel better, make it alright
Give me your sweater, hold my hand tight
Seven days in limbo, push me out the window
Nothing in common, nothing to lose
Nothing but problems between me and you
With your arms akimbo, seven days in limbo
Seven days

[Bridge]
If you love me, let me go
If you love me, leave limbo

[Chorus]
Can't make me feel better, make it alright
Can't give me your sweater, hold my hand tight
Seven days in limbo, just push me out the window
Nothing in common, nothing to lose
Nothing but problems between me and you
With your arms akimbo, seven days in limbo
Seven days

[Chorus]
You used to call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love
Call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love
I know when that hotline bling
That could only mean one thing
I know when that hotline bling
That could only mean one thing

[Verse 1]
'Cause ever since I left the city, you
Got a reputation for yourself now
Everybody knows and I feel left out
Girl, you got me down, you got me stressed out
'Cause ever since I left the city, you
Started wearing less and goin' out more
Glasses of champagne out on the dance floor
Hangin' with some girls I've never seen before
'Cause ever since I left the city

[Instrumental]

[Outro]





Lyrics from a Snippet

[Verse 1]
You're saying that you miss me, oh well
Never even got a kiss without a countdown
It's time to face the facts
You treat me like a snack
Only text back when you're hungry
Your love's so insecure
You're never really sure
Boy, you never listen

[Chorus]
I'm not gonna write another stupid song about you, baby

[Verse 2]
You're saying that you're sorry, so what?
You ask me what I want, for you to shut up
It's time to come to terms
Put myself first
When your bubble bursts got soap in your eye
Telling you it's wrong to break into my songs
Boy, you gotta listen

[Chorus]
I'm not gonna write another stupid song about you, baby

[Bridge]
So take this as my last reply
And play it when you're lonely
Don't you say I didn't try to reach
Your hand to hold me
I just wanna walk the line
Press record and hit rewind
I've made up my mind to erase you
Oh, to erase you
Oh, to erase you
Oh, oh

[Verse 1]
Lights out
You're not here holding me
I count
Every tear down my cheek
Instead of sheep

[Verse 2]
Sleep walk
Find myself on your street
Three knocks
Ring the bell then I leave

[Chorus]
I tried to live in black and white but I'm so blue
I'd like to mean it when I say I'm over you
But that's still not true

[Verse 3]
Cold days
Frozen lake in the park
Old ways
Make mistakes when I'm lost
Now we've got it all

[Verse 4]
Bad dreams
Might not mean anything
But you seem
Not to need anything

[Chorus]
I tried to live in black and white but I'm so blue
I'd like to mean it when I say I'm over you
But that's still not true

[Bridge]
I'm still so blue
True blue, true blue, hey
True blue

[Chorus: Billie Eilish]
I tried to live in black and white but I'm so blue
I'd like to mean it when I say I'm over you
I tried to live in black and white but I'm so blue
I'd like to mean it when I say I'm over you
But that's still not true

[Outro: Billie Eilish]
And I'm still so blue
True blue, true blue, hey
True blue

[Verse 1]
Your butt is mine, I'm gonna tell you right
Just show your face in broad daylight
I'm telling you on how I feel
Gonna hurt your mind, don't shoot to kill
I'm giving you on count of three
To show your stuff or let it be
'Cause I'm telling you just watch your mouth
I know your game what you're about

[Pre-Chorus]
Well they say the sky's the limit
And to me that's really true
But my friend you have seen nothing
So just wait till I get through

[Chorus]
Because I'm bad, I'm bad, c'mon
You know I'm big, I'm bad, you know
You know I'm big, I'm bad, I'm really really bad
And the whole world's got has to answer right now
Just to tell you once again
Who's bad?

[Verse 2]
The word is out, you're doing wrong
Gonna lock you up before too long
Your lying eyes gonna tell you right
So listen up, don't make a fight
Your talk is cheap, you're not a man
You're throwing stones to hide your hands

[Pre-Chorus]
Well they say the sky's the limit
And to me that's really true
But my friend you have seen nothing
So just wait till I get through

[Chorus]
Because I'm big, I'm bad, c'mon
You know I'm big, I'm bad, you know
You know I'm big, I'm bad, I'm really really bad
And the whole world's got to answer right now
Just to tell you once again
Who's bad?

[Verse 1]
So you're still thinking of me
Just like I know you should
I can not give you everything, you know I wish I could
I'm so high at the moment
I'm so caught up in this
Yeah, we're just young, dumb and broke
But we still got love to give

[Chorus]
While we're young dumb
Young, young dumb and broke
Young dumb
Young, young dumb and broke
Young dumb
Young dumb
Young, young dumb and broke
Young dumb broke high school kids
Yadadadadadadada
Yadadadadadada
Yadadadadadadada
Young dumb broke high school kids

[Verse 2]
We have so much in common
We argue all the time
You always say I'm wrong
I'm pretty sure I'm right
What's fun about commitment?
When we have our life to live
Yeah, we're just young dumb and broke
But we still got love to give

[Chorus]
While we're young dumb
Young, young dumb and broke
Young dumb
Young, young dumb and broke
Young dumb
Young, young dumb and broke
Young dumb broke high school kids
Yadadadadadadada
Yadadadadadada
Yadadadadadadada
Young dumb broke high school kids

[Bridge]
Jump and we think - do it all in the name of love
Love
Run into sin, do it all in the name of fun
Fun
Whoa-oa-oa
I'm so high at the moment
I'm so caught up in this
Yeah, we're just young, dumb and broke
But we still got love to give

[Chorus]
While we're young dumb
Young, young dumb and broke
Young dumb
Young, young dumb and broke
Young dumb
Young dumb
Young, young dumb and broke
Young dumb broke high school kids
Yadadadadadadada
Yadadadadadada
Yadadadadadadada
Young dumb broke high school kids

[Chorus]
Send me your location, let's
Focus on communicating
'Cause I just need the time and place to come through 
Send me your location
Let's ride the vibrations
I don't need nothing else but you


[Verse 1]
At times I wonder why I fool with you
But this is new to me, this is new to you
Initially, I didn't wanna fall for you
Gather my attention it was all for you, so don't
Take advantage, don't leave my heart damaged
I understand that things go a little bit better when you plan it... oh, so won't

[Chorus]
Send me your location, let's
Focus on communicating
'Cause I just need the time and place to come through
Send me your location
Let's ride the vibrations
I don't need nothing else but you


[Verse 2]
I don't wanna fall in love off of subtweets, so
Let's get personal
I got a lot of cool spots that we can go
Tell me what's the move and I got you
I'm only acting like this 'cause I like you
Just give me the vibe to slide in
Oh, I might make you mine by the night, and

[Chorus]
Send me your location, let's
Focus on communicating
'Cause I just need the time and place to come through 
Send me your location
Let's ride the vibrations
I don't need nothing else but you


[Outro]
Ride, ride, ride, come and vibe with me tonight
I don't need nothing else but you

Ride, ride, ride, come and vibe with me tonight
I don't need nothing else but you
Nothing else but you
Do, do, do, do, do, do
Oh, oh, mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, mmm, mmm, mmm
Do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do
Do, do, do, do, do, do, do
I don't need nothing else but you

[Intro]
Better
Nothing, baby
Nothing feels better
I'm not really drunk, I never get that fucked up
I'm not, I'm so sober

[Verse 1]
Love to see you shine in the night like the diamond you are

I'm good on the side, it's alright, just hold me in the dark

No one's gotta know what we do, hit me up when you're bored

'Cause I live down the street
So we meet when you need and it's yours
All I hear is...

[Chorus]
Nothing feels better than this
Nothing feels better
Nothing feels better than this
Nothing feels better, oh no
We don't gotta hide, this is what you like
I'll admit
Nothing feels better than this

[Verse 2]
You say we're just friends but I swear when nobody's around

You keep my hand around your neck, we connect, are you feeling it now?

'Cause I am
I got so high the other night, I swear to God, felt my feet lift the ground

Ooh, yeah
Your back against the wall, this is all you've been talking about
In my ears

[Chorus]
Nothing feels better than this
Nothing feels better
Nothing feels better than this
Nothing feels better, oh no
We don't gotta hide, this is what you like
I admit
Nothing feels better than this

[Bridge]
Now, left, right, left, right
Take it back, bring it side to side
Like that, like that, ayy
Ooh, now, left, right, left, right
Take it back, bring it side to side
Like

[Chorus]
Nothing feels better than this
Nothing feels better
Nothing feels better than this
Nothing feels better, oh no
We don't gotta hide, this is what you like
I admit
Nothing feels better than this 

[Outro]
Nothing feels better than this

[Intro]
2, 3, 4

[Verse 1]
The hard part always seems to last forever
Sometimes I forget that we aren't together
Deep down in my heart, I hope you're doing alright
But from time to time I often think of why you aren't mine

[Chorus]
But I'll keep your number saved
'Cause I hope one day you'll get the sense to call me
I'm hoping that you'll say
You're missing me the way I'm missing you
So I'll keep your number saved
'Cause I hope one day I'll get the pride to call you
To tell you that no one else
Is gonna hold you down the way that I do

[Verse 2]
Now, I can't say I'll be alright without you
And I can't say that I haven't tried to
But, all your stuff is gone
I erased all the pictures from my phone
Of me and you
Here's what I'll do

[Chorus]
I'll keep your number saved
'Cause I hope one day you'll get the sense to call me
I'm hoping that you'll say
You're missing me the way I'm missing you
So I'll keep your number saved
'Cause I hope one day I'll get the pride to call you
To tell you that no one else
Is gonna hold you down the way that I do

[Bridge]
I hope you think of all the times we shared
I hope you'll finally realize I was the only one who cared
It's crazy how this love thing seems unfair
You won't find a love like mine anywhere

[Chorus]
But I'll keep your number saved
'Cause I hope one day you'll get the sense to call me
I'm hoping that you'll say
You're missing me the way I'm missing you
So I'll keep your number saved
'Cause I hope one day I'll get the pride to call you
To tell you that no one else
Is gonna hold you down the way that I do
But I'll keep your number saved
'Cause I hope one day you'll get the sense to call me
I'm hoping that you'll say
You're missing me the way I'm missing you
So I'll keep your number saved
'Cause I hope one day I'll get the pride to call you
To tell you that I'm finally over you
I'm finally over you

[Chorus]
Can we just talk? Can we just talk?
Talk about where we're goin'
Before we get lost, lend me your thoughts
Can't get what we want without knowin'
I've never felt like this before
I apologize if I'm movin' too far
Can we just talk? Can we just talk?
Figure out where we're goin'

[Verse 1]
Yeah, started off right
I can see it in your eyes
I can tell that you're wantin' more
What's been on your mind?
There's no reason we should hide
Tell me somethin' I ain't heard before

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, I've been dreamin' 'bout it
And it's you I'm on
So stop thinkin' 'bout it

[Chorus]
Can we just talk? Can we just talk?
Talk about where we're goin'
Before we get lost, lend me your thoughts 
Can't get what we want without knowin' 
I've never felt like this before
I apologize if I'm movin' too far
Can we just talk? Can we just talk?
Figure out where we're goin'

[Verse 2]
Oh, nah
Penthouse view, left some flowers in the room
I'll make sure I leave the door unlocked
Now I'm on the way, swear I won't be late
I'll be there by five o'clock

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, you've been dreamin' 'bout it
And I'm what you want
So stop thinkin' 'bout it

[Chorus]
Can we just talk?  Can we just talk?
Talk about where we're goin'
Before we get lost, lend me your thoughts
Can't get what we want without knowin'
I've never felt like this before
I apologize if I'm movin' too far
Can we just talk? Can we just talk?
Figure out where we're goin'

[Outro]
Figure out where we're goin'

[Verse 1]
As time passes, I feel so low
Searchin' for pieces, covering up the hole
I'll fight for your love, I'll fight for your soul
I'll throw all of my cares away for you
I'll be there to wait for you
Maybe you weren't the one for me
But deep down I wanted you to be
I'll still see you in my dreams
All the things that I did for you, just wasn't it for you

[Chorus]
So I'll be coasting, roller-coasting
Through my emotion
I will be coasting, roller-coasting
I'm hoping that you'll come back to me

[Verse 2]
Moving on seems harder to do
When the one that you love moves faster than you
I gave you my all, I showed the proof of your lies
And you weren't worth it, you don't deserve me
As time passes I'm feeling high
You're not the one I'm thinking of tonight
I may not be over you, but I'll try inside
I'm feeling better now, finally feeling special now, oh

[Chorus]
Coasting, roller-coasting
In my emotions, oh
I'll be coasting, roller-coasting
I noticed you weren't the one for me

[Outro]
You weren't the one for me
You weren't the one for me
You weren't the one for me
You weren't the one for me
Weren't the one for me
You weren't the one
You weren't the one for me
So don't come back to me, no
No, don't come back to me, no
No, don't come back to me
No, don't come back to me, no
No, don't come back to me
You weren't the one for me
You weren't the one for me
You weren't the one for me
You weren't the one for me

[Intro: Khalid]
Na, na, na, na, ooh
Oh, no, oh, ayy

[Chorus: Khalid]
Put it in drive, I'll be outside, I'll be on the way
I'll be on the way
You can meet me in five, I'll be all night, I'll be a-all day

Put it in drive, I'll be outside, I'll be on the way

You can meet me in five, I'll be all night, I'll be all day

[Verse 1: Khalid]
Yeah, yeah, yeah
This the type of shit that you been waiting all year for
Back in town for a minute if you with it 
Got a lot of time, I just need somewhere to spend it
I just press a button and the top go missing
I kept the slip so you know it's not rented, yeah, oh, oh
What you wanna do?
Worried 'bout your friends, they saw you this afternoon
I been reading your mind
No fair, but you gotta let me know
I'm all ears and I got a lot of room in my whip
If you wanna take it there, I'm on my way

[Chorus: Khalid]
Put it in drive, I'll be outside, I'll be on the way
I'll be on the way
You can meet me in five, I'll be all night, I'll be all day
I'll be all day
Put it in drive, I'll be outside, I'll be on the way
I'll be on the way
You can meet me in five, I'll be all night, I'll be all day
I'll be all day

[Verse 2: Ty Dolla $ign]

Drop top the Porsche, put that bitch in sport
Out here in the field, oh yeah , I'm already here, yeah
Come outside, looking like a snack, hurry up, get in, hell yeah 
Come with me on this mission 
Riding down the coast , I want that for sure 
You say, "Play Khalid" 
I say, "Pass the weed" 
Pull up to the crib, oh, said you've never been before
Put you in Provocateur, girl, I made you mi amor
You said you left your ex, that dude was always gassin'
You said before me, you ain't never been this happy
You took an L with him and winning ever since 
You hit my phone, I'm on my way, I cancel plans, yeah, yeah

[Chorus: Khalid]
Put it in drive, I'll be outside, I'll be on the way
I'll be on the way

You can meet me in five, I'll be all night, I'll be all day

[Verse 3: 6LACK]
You tryna make a move
Tonight I got the time, tell me what you wanna do
Call the squad if you wanna rendezvous
They gon' push up on they own, I only got room for two
From the 'jects on the set, it's a Porsche, not a 'Vette
I confess, I'ma flex till they show some respect
Get away so we can make sense of your life
You was in park but I just put your shit in drive
Now coast like there's no tomorrow
Moving too fast, I'm open to drive slow 
I don't want you to wonder where I go
Can learn a lot from this and that's something that I know

[Chorus: Khalid]
Put it in drive, I'll be outside, I'll be on the way
I'll be on the way
You can meet me in five, I'll be all night, I'll be all day
I'll be all day
Put it in drive, I'll be outside, I'll be on the way
I'll be on the way
You can meet me in five, I'll be all night, I'll be all day
I'll be all day

[Intro]
Yeah!
Ha
Yeah!
Ha

[Verse 1]
Woke up a little too late this morning
But I think I'll be okay
I'll be okay
Damn, my car still smells like marijuana
My mom is gonna kill me
Gonna kill me
Traffic's backed up from corner to corner
So I guess I'll hit the highway
The highway
Shake away all the stress off my shoulders
Gonna have a good day
A good day

[Chorus]
Because I'm eighteen
And I still live with my parents
Yeah they're not like yours
Well yours are more understanding
I've never fell in love
I saved those feelings for you
So let's do all the stupid shit that young kids do
Its me and you, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
You, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Just me and you, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Let's do all the stupid shit that young kids do

[Verse 2]
No I've never really been the smartest
Yeah I've made my mistakes
My mistakes
You were there when times were at their darkest
Always showing me the way
Lead the way
Your love seems to cut me deep, the sharpest
You'll always have a part of me
A part of me
Losing you has always been the hardest
I wish it were the old days 

[Chorus]
'Cause I was eighteen
And I still lived with my parents
Yeah they're not like yours
Well yours were more understanding
I never fell in love
I saved those feelings for you
When we did all the stupid shit that young kids do
Just me and you, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
You, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Just me and you, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Let's do all the stupid shit that young kids do

[Bridge]
It's me and you
You

You
Just me and you
You
You, ooh, ooh, ooh
Heyhey

[Chorus]
Because I'm eighteen
And I still live with my parents
Yeah they're not like yours
Well yours are more understanding
I've never fell in love
I saved those feelings for you
So let's do all the stupid shit that young kids do
Its me and you, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
It's me and you, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Just me and you, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Let's do all the stupid shit that young kids do

[Outro]
It's me and you, ooh, ooh
Noooo....
Just me and you, ooh, ooh

[Verse 1]
Saturday nights, blueberry cigarillos
Swishers make my throat hurt
Rolling OCB's on the side for me
Light 'em up and let 'em both burn
Family feuds, say your mom's confused
Off of shit she doesn't wanna learn
But daddy's gone, say he's never home
And wishing only makes it worse

[Pre-Chorus]
I guess there's certain dreams that you gotta keep
'Cause they'll only know what you let 'em see

[Chorus]
All the things that I know
That your parents don't
They don't care like I do
Nowhere like I do
And all the things that I know
That your parents don't
They don't care like I do
Nowhere like I do
Nowhere like I do
Nowhere like I do

[Verse 2]
Saturday nights, light gray Silverado
You drive it 'cause you have to
Stay up working late at a job you hate
Fix your makeup in a dirty bathroom
No more love, in and out of clubs
Knowing what you gotta do
You've got plans wrapped in rubber bands
And that's the only thing you'll never lose

[Pre-Chorus]
I guess there's certain dreams that you gotta keep
'Cause they'll only know what you let 'em see

[Chorus]
All the things that I know
That your parents don't
They don't care like I do
Nowhere like I do
And all the things that I know
That your parents don't
They don't care like I do
Nowhere like I do
Nowhere like I do

[Bridge]
'Cause I care, I care about you
There's nowhere I'd rather be
Than right here around you
I care, care about you
There's nowhere I'd rather be

[Chorus]
All the things that I know
That your parents don't
They don't care about you
Nowhere like I do
All the things that I know
That your parents don't
Don't care about you
Nowhere like I
Nowhere like I do 
Nowhere like I do 
Nowhere like I do 
Nowhere like I do 

[Chorus: Khalid & Empress Of]
Llvame a ciudad del sol
Llvame, llvame
Donde dej mi corazn
Llvame, llvame
Llvamelo
Solo en la ciudad del sol
Llvame, llvame
Donde dej mi corazn
Llvame, llvame
Llvamelo

[Verse 1: Khalid]
Two days 'til I'm back on the road and I'm wanting you
I hear you calling me, so come onto me tonight
No time to be worried about what we wanna do
Just take care of me, I'll let you take the lead tonight

[Pre-Chorus: Khalid & Empress Of]
Feel it coming over me
Slo as junto a ti
Don't let the city break your heart
Conmigo no tienes que llorar

[Chorus: Khalid & Empress Of]
Llvame a ciudad del sol
Llvame, llvame
Donde dej mi corazn
Llvame, llvame
Llvamelo
Solo en la ciudad del sol
Llvame, llvame

[Verse 2: Khalid]
No room to be falling for you without honesty
Don't be scared of me
It's where you wanna be, tonight
It's alright, alright for the meantime
If I have to wait, I'll be patient, babe
Tonight

[Pre-Chorus: Khalid & Empress Of]
Slo as junto a ti
Don't let the city break your heart 
Conmigo no tienes que llorar

[Chorus: Khalid & Empress Of]
Llvame a ciudad del sol
Llvame, llvame

[Bridge: Khalid]
Wind it up slow for me, pick it up, pick it up
Wind it up slow for me, pick it up, pick it up
Wind it up slow for me, pick it up, pick it up
Wind it up slow for me, pick it up, pick it up

[Chorus: Khalid & Empress Of]
Llvame a ciudad del sol
Llvame, llvame

[Outro]
I-I send you a lot of, a lot of hugs
And, I hope to see you very soon

[Verse 1]
Living the good life full of goodbyes
My eyes are on the grey skies
Saying I don't want to come home tonight
Yeah, and I'm high up, off what?
I don't even remember
But my friend passed out in the Uber ride

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, I'm from the city of the 9-1-5
Where all the girls are pretty
And they're down for the hype
All my boys are with me
Going up for the night
But who cares, who cares
'Cause this is our year

[Chorus]
So wake me up in the spring
While I'm high off my American dream
We don't always say what we mean
That's the lie of an American teen

[Verse 2]
Maybe the end is near
But I've been waiting all year
To get the hell up out of here
And throw away my fears
I'm so faded 
Off of all the things that I've taken, and
Maybe I'm not really drunk
Maybe I'm really good at faking

[Pre-Chorus]
From the city of the 9-1-5
Where all the girls are pretty
And they're down for the hype
All my boys are with me
Going up for the night
But who cares, who cares
'Cause this is our year

[Chorus]
So wake me up in the spring
While I'm high off my American dream
We don't always say what we mean
That's the lie of an American teen

[Bridge]
My youth is the foundation of me
Living life as an American teen 
American teen
Mmm, oh yeah
We don't always say what we mean
When we're high off our American teen
My youth is the foundation of me
Oh, I'm proud to be American


[Chorus]
So wake me up in the spring
While I'm high off my American 
And we don't always say what we mean
It's the lie of an American teen
My youth is the foundation of me
Living life as an American teen
American teen 

[Outro]
American Teenager
And I'll be living this dream with you

[Chant]
We don't always say what we mean
When we're high off our American teen
My youth is the foundation of me
Oh, I'm proud to be American

[Intro]
Something that you're doing has me falling all the way
I'm tripping off your love and all the other drugs we taking
Over all the others, you're the one all over me
I need your therapy
Need your therapy

[Verse 1]
I don't mean to come off aggressive 
I'm just here to pass off the message 
'Cause you were in my head when
I thought I lost my mind
But we do this every time

[Chorus]
Cause there's something that you're doing has me falling all the way
I'm tripping off your love and all the other drugs we taking
Over all the others, you're the one all over me
I need your therapy, need your therapy

[Verse 2]
I'm not one for relationships
It's over-rated
We could still be lovers
That's all I'm saying, and
Over all the others, you're the one all over me
I need your therapy
Need your therapy

[Bridge]
I'm fiendin' off, fiendin' off you
Lalalalalala
I'm needin', needin' you
Lalalalalala
I'm fiendin' off, fiendin' off you
Lalalalalala
I'm needin', needin' you
Lalalalalala

[Verse 3]
I hope I made the impression
That I was always interested
All the feelings I kept in
What should we do?
Whatever you want to

[Chorus]
'Cause there's something that you're doing has me falling all the way
I'm tripping off your love and all the other drugs we taking
Over all the others, you're the one all over me
I need your therapy, need your therapy

[Verse 4]
I'm not one for relationships
It's over-rated
We could still be lovers
That's all I'm saying, and
Over all the others, you're the one all over me
I need your therapy
Need your therapy

[Bridge]
I'm fiendin' off, fiendin' off you
Lalalalalala
I'm needin', needin' you
Lalalalalala
I'm fiendin' off, fiendin' off you
Lalalalalala
I'm needin', needin' you
Lalalalalala

[Verse 1]
I'm not the best at showing my emotions
You cut me deep and you left me wide open
I fought the demons that lie in between us
They'd think we're perfect if they'd ever seen us, but
I guess this sounds like another sad love song
I can't get over how it all went wrong
But, I let the words come together
Then, maybe I'll feel better

[Chorus]
Bridges they are burning
Lover, I am worried
Tables they are turning
Lover, I am hurting
Burning burning burning, dadadadada
Turning turning turning turning, dadadadada
Burning burning burning, dadadadada
Turning turning turning turning, dadadadada

[Verse 2]
I took the time to think of what you said
You were tap-dancing in my head
I must be honest, I have a lot of pride
But I'm broken inside
I guess this sounds like another sad love song
I can't get over how it all went wrong
But, I let the words come together
Then, maybe I'll feel better

[Chorus]
Bridges they are burning
Lover, I am worried
Tables they are turning
Lover, I am hurting
Bridges they are burning
Lover, I am worried
Tables they are turning
Lover, I am hurting
Burning burning burning, dadadadada
Turning turning turning turning, dadadadada
Burning burning burning, dadadadada
Turning turning turning turning, dadadadada
Burning burning burning, dadadadada
Turning turning turning turning, dadadadada
Burning burning burning, dadadadada
Turning turning turning turning, dadadadada
Bridges they are burning
Lover, I am worried
Tables they are turning
Lover, I am hurting
Bridges they are burning
Lover, I am worried
Tables they are turning
Lover, I am hurting

[Verse 1]
We've been here before, surrounded in the cold
You take me to places I've never known
And you push me to places I'll never go
I would die for you
Tell me the truth
Am I all that you would need?
If we're keeping it a hundred, you're all that I need for me
From the jump until forever from now, I would ride for you

[Chorus]
But you got me shot down by love
You got my heart now
Why won't you stop now?
Oh I've been knocked down by you
You got my heart now
Why won't you stop now?

[Verse 2]
I've been through it whole
I've been through the worst
But I never knew how much our love could hurt
Over my family I put you first
Writing out my feelings is the only thing that work
I don't hear from the friends I thought were mine too
But I hold on to the poems I would write you
Happy seventeen, I saw us two and you saw three
I guess our lines are structured like a haiku

[Chorus 2
You got me shot down by love
And you got my heart now
Why won't you stop now?
Oh I've been knocked down by you
And you got my heart now
Why won't you stop now?

[Bridge]
Knocked down, knocked down
Knocked down, knocked down
Knocked down
Knocked down

[Chorus]
I've been shot down by love
You got my heart now
Why won't you stop now?
I've been knocked down by you
And you got my heart now
Why won't you stop now?

[Verse 1]
I've been seeing angels
In my living room
That have walked the sun
And have slept on the moon
Covered in the fragrance
Of their own perfume
Telling me the stories
Stories coming true
Well you see these angels
These angels see the light
Yeah I had my troubles
Troubles, all right
I've been seeing angels
Oh no

[Verse 2]
They'll hold onto their secrets
And torn up memories
We float above horizons
And sail across the seas
I hope for better days
And lightly times are tough
The angels give me strength
And I'm not giving up
So I wipe away my tears
I unveil my pain
They're brushing off my shoulders
And I hold on to their stain
I've been seeing angels

[Outro]
Angels
Angels
Angels
Angels
Angels
Angels, ayy
Angels

[Verse 1]
Evade my intellect
Feed into my introspect
Wrap your words around my brain
Driving me insane, yeah, ooh
You found the real me
Save my inner being
Switch on me like seasons
Do I need to give you a reason?

[Chorus]
There's millions of reasons to love you 
There's millions of reasons 
You give me a reason to want you 
You give me a reason
Give me a reason, give me a reason, give me a reason 
Give me a reason, give me a reason, give me a reason 
Yeah 

[Verse 2]
I know you're tired of inconsistency
Are you into me? Are you feeling me?
To be honest
I'm into you, and the way that you talk is so damn cool
With your love I'm on a different high I've never felt before
And if your love is a drug, I'm an addict 'cause, damn, I'm feening for more, yeah
We've been talking for a minute now
Let me know where your heads at, am I in it? Yeah
You put me on your super high
I want to get lost in your paradise

[Chorus]
There's millions of reasons to love you 
There's millions of reasons 
You give me a reason to want you 
You give me a reason 
Give me a reason, give me a reason, give me a reason 
Give me a reason, give me a reason, give me a reason 

[Verse 3]
Lucid dream, in reality
I'm just tryna feel your gravity
Always fallin in love, and I'm tired of the cycle
We don't even need a title
You're always on my mind
It's funny how I'm thinking about you all the damn time
You don't got to be mine, just be mine for the night
I don't know what this is but it feels just right
I wanna make a move
Let me know if that sounds cool, yeah
All the things I'd do
All the things I'd do for you

[Chorus]
There's millions of reasons to love you 
There's millions of reasons 
You give me a reason to want you 
You give me a reason 
Give me a reason, give me a reason, give me a reason 
Give me a reason, give me a reason, give me a reason 

[Intro]
Cold blooded, cold blooded

[Verse 1]
The way you've been treating me is getting out of hand
And you walk around like you're so innocent
I gave you my heart and it melted in your arms
This isn't a place that I belong

[Pre-Chorus]
I feel your fear
Surrounded by your skin
You feel my heartbeat vibrate so violent
Inside of your head
I see it in your eyes
You're no good for me
And love is blind

[Chorus]
Ooh, and cold blooded, cold blooded
You want what I'm giving up
But my love is not enough
Cold blooded, cold blooded
And I cant feel my fingertips
But you feel better when we touch

[Verse 2]
I lost my sight and you're leading me on
Is it 'cause you're used to guys always doing you wrong?
Do you really love me?
Or is it just revenge?
Lately you don't seem so genuine

[Pre-Chorus]
And I feel your fear
Surrounded by your skin
You feel my heartbeat vibrate so violent
Inside of your head
I see it in your eyes 
That you're no good for me
And love is blind

[Chorus]
Ooh, and cold blooded, cold blooded
You want what I'm giving up
But my love is not enough
Cold blooded, cold blooded
And I can't feel my fingertips
But you feel better when we touch

[Bridge]
Mmmm
Fill me up, keep me hot
Use me up of all I've got

[Pre-Chorus]
I feel your fear
Surrounded by your skin
You feel my heartbeat vibrate so violent
Inside of your head
I see it in your eyes
You're no good for me
And love is blind

[Chorus]
Ooh, and cold blooded, cold blooded
You want what I'm giving up
But my love is not enough
Cold blooded, cold blooded
And I can't feel my fingertips
But you feel better when we touch

[Outro]
Mmmm
Fill me up, keep me hot
Use me up of all I've got
Cold blooded, cold blooded 
Cold blooded, cold blooded 

[Verse 1]
Can't count up the times you've blown my line
And that's been on my mind a lot lately
I wanna leave the extra all behind, mmm
And I know that you wanna be my baby, mmm yeah

[Chorus]
Said, my bad
Blowin' me up, you've been wildin'
We was cool, yeah, we was vibin'
Gotta put my phone on silent
So my, my, my, my bad
Blowin' me up, you've been wildin'
We were cool, yeah, we was vibin'
Gotta put my phone on silent
So my, my, my bad

[Verse 2]
Oh, we both care about it
But arguing with me just isn't worth it
No, no, no
Don't go reachin' in your bag, your bag, yeah
I didn't text you back 'cause I was workin'
Ah, yeah

[Chorus]
Said, my bad
Blowin' me up, you've been wildin'
We was cool, yeah, we was vibin'
Gotta put my phone on silent
So my, my, my, my bad
Blowin' me up, you've been wildin'
We were cool, yeah, we was vibin'
Gotta put my phone on silent
So my, my, my bad

[Bridge]
Gave you all the signs
Gave you all of my time, my love
You're followin' the signs
But you're followin' the wrong signs, my love
Gave you all the signs
Gave you all of my time, my love

You're followin' the signs
But you're followin' the wrong signs, my love

[Chorus]
Said, my bad
Blowin' me up, you've been wildin'
We was cool, yeah, we was vibin' 
Gotta put my phone on silent 
So my, my, my, my bad 
Blowin' me up, you've been wildin' 
We were cool, yeah, we was vibin'
Gotta put my phone on silent
So my, my, my bad

[Outro]
Oh my, my, my
Oh my, my, my
My bad, my bad
Alright

[Verse 1]
I lost my heart in the nighttime
She left me out in the cold
She left me broken and weary
Drunk off the lies she told
I fell in love in the morning
But when the day gets cold
I'm back to life in my lonely
City of El Paso

[Chorus]
But the days get harder in November
Love grows colder in the winter
All the things you say, I'll remember
Promise that you'll keep my love with ya
Promise that you'll keep my love with ya
Promise that you'll keep my love with ya
Love grows colder in the winter
Promise that you'll keep my love with ya

[Verse 2]
I lost my mind when you left me
And I didn't have much of that
But you were so quick to reject me
So I'll take my time being sad
I fell so hard, I'll admit it
The feeling wasn't mutual
So I'm back to live on my lonely
In the city of El Paso

[Chorus]
But the days get harder in November
Love grows colder in the winter
All the things you say, I'll remember
Promise that you'll keep my love with ya
Promise that you'll keep my love with ya
Promise that you'll keep my love with ya
Love grows colder in the winter
Promise that you'll keep my love with ya

[Bridge]
Promise, promise, promise, promise
Promise, promise, promise, promise
Promise, promise that you'll keep my love 
Promise, promise, promise, promise
Promise, promise, promise, promise
Promise, promise that you'll keep my love 

[Chorus]
But the days get harder in November
Love grows colder in the winter
All the things you say, I'll remember
Promise that you'll keep my love with ya
Promise that you'll keep my love with ya
Promise that you'll keep my love with ya
Love grows colder in the winter
Promise that you'll keep my love with ya

[Verse 1]
Are we better off believing
What the ignorance suggests?
I wish living life was easy 
But mine has been a mess
They say it comes with the seasons 
But the seasons come and go 
I go blurry when I'm thinking
Is it me or vertigo?

[Pre-Chorus]
Criticized, who am I to give up?
Im breathing, what's the reason to let up?
Sympathize, who am I to give up?
Putting on my favorite get up

[Chorus]
Are we alive?
Or are we dreaming?
After the ride
Are you leaving?
Are we alive? 
Or are we dreaming? 
After the ride
Are you leaving? 
Yeah

[Verse 2]
I've been better off than broken
Ive been battered, I've been beat
I wish I was more outspoken
But the words are out of reach
Hmm, thought I loved you in the moment
I was happy, I was young
I've been learning, I've been growing
But the worst is yet to come

[Pre-Chorus]
Criticized, who am I to give up? 
I'm breathing, what's the reason to let up?
Sympathize, who am I to give up?
Putting on my favorite get up

[Chorus]
Are we alive?
Or are we dreaming?
After the ride
Are you leaving?
Are we alive? 
Or are we dreaming? 
After the ride
Are you leaving? 
Yeah


[Outro]
Eyes closed, eyes closed
I've been falling with my
Eyes low, eyes low
I've been falling with my
Eyes closed, eyes closed
Ive been falling with my
Eyes low, eyes low
Ive been falling with my
Eyes closed, eyes closed
I've been falling with my
Eyes low, eyes low
Ive been falling with my 
Eyes closed, eyes closed 
I've been falling with my 
Eyes low, eyes low
I've been, I've been, Ive been
Eyes closed, eyes closed
I've been falling with my
Eyes low, eyes low
I've been falling with my
Eyes closed, eyes closed
I've been falling with my
Eyes low, eyes low
I've been falling with my

[Intro]
Everybody two-step in the motherfucker, what?
Two-step in the motherfucker, yeah
Everybody two-step in the motherfucker, what?
Two-step in the motherfucker, everybody get up, yeah

[Verse 1]
Can you feel this energy?
This is the start of something great
We might... be a little late... hey
Hey, but at least we're on our way
You got too much time to waste
Focusing on what people say
They might not like that we've arrived
But we're here to stay

[Pre-Chorus]
Leave your sorrow on the table
Pick up your worries and throw them out the window
You don't gotta let your friends know
There's so much trouble to get into

[Chorus]
Let's go, let go
Let's go, let go

[Verse 2]
I got a blacked out Chevrolet
You don't have a destination
Traveling where the wind will take us
That might be from place to place
Oh shit, I just graduated
I don't have any obligations
So let's have a little fun
Go 'head and drop all the relations

[Pre-Chorus]
Leave your sorrow on the table
Pick up your worries and throw them out the window
You don't gotta let your friends know
There's so much trouble to get into

[Chorus]
Let go, let go
Let's go, let's go
So let's go, let's go
Let go, let's go

[Verse 1]
Spend my time worrying of broken promises
Focused on the smell of all the burnt out cigarettes
My thoughts play on repeat
Only comfort that I keep
'Cause in a moment I will be
Something you will forget

[Chorus]
Hopeless, hopelessly romantic
You, you got me stranded
Ooh, I'm blue, blue, blue

[Verse 2]
Now tell me was I ever something that you could regret
I know I wasn't the one for you
But at least I tried my best
Surrounded by questions like, "Why'd you two part ways?"
But if my memorys right
You're the one that left

[Chorus]
I'll be hopeless hopelessly romantic
You, you got me stranded
Ooh, I'm blue, blue, blue

[Bridge]
Used to lift me higher
But I guess our time's expired
I'm giving you the match
Set our love on fire

[Chorus]
Hopeless hopelessly romantic
You, you got me stranded
Ooh, I'm blue, blue, blue

[Verse 2 ]
Now tell me was I ever something that you could regret
I know I wasn't the one for you
But at least I tried my best
Surrounded by questions like, "Why'd you two part ways?"
But if my memorys right
You're the one that left

[Chorus]
I'll be hopeless hopelessly romantic
You, you got me stranded
Ooh, I'm blue, blue, blue
Ooh yeah, I'm blue, blue, blue, oh
Yeah, I'm blue, blue, blue

[Verse 1: Khalid]
You say I'm trippin'; bullshit
You're the one to make me do shit
You're the one to make me feel it
The feeling of stupid
I was in your corner
When you were putting me through shit
Now you wanna leave
No, you leaving me was foolish

[Pre-Chorus: Khalid]
You left me this scar on my heart
And I left you a brand new car
How nice of you, the price of true love
True love is absolute

[Chorus: Khalid]
So what more can I say?
You make me this way
What more can I say?
You make me this way

[Verse 2: H.E.R.]
Yeah, all of these excuses
Say I'm the one that made you ruthless
Well you're the reason I'm crazy
And with you, I feel useless
I let you have it
You took me for granted
Always wanna play the victim
When they don't know the truth is...

[Pre-Chorus: H.E.R. with Khalid]
You left me this scar on my heart
When I'd never take it that far 
Why would you say that it was true love
If true love is absolute, what more can I say?

[Chorus: Khalid & H.E.R., H.E.R.]
What more can I say?
You make me this way

What more can I say?

You make me this way

[Bridge: H.E.R.]
I tried to stay the night
You won't let me inside
Oh, you push me away
You'll never change
Just another fight
Between you and your pride
Oh, what more can I say?
What more can I?

[Chorus: Khalid & H.E.R., H.E.R.]
What more can I say? 
You make me this way
You make me this way
What more can I say?
What more?
You make me this way 
What, can I?

[Intro: Lil Wayne]
Remix, baby, yeah

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
I meet you at the spot, send the location
I don't do this a lot, special occasion
I know you ain't a thottie, you ain't no basic
I turn your dry spot to an oasis
I kiss the right spots, I know all the places
Oh I lick the right spots, that's an ultimatum
The loud in rotation, cloud 9, flotation
Let the rose petals spread like rosacea
I know your ex to blame for your cold nature
Tell him stay in his lane, stop the road ragin'
And now I got you in here makin' those faces
Runnin' 'round the bedroom like four bases, moolah!

[Chorus: Khalid]
Send me your location, let's
Focus on communicating
'Cause I just need the time and place to come through 
Send me your location
Let's ride the vibrations
I don't need nothing else but you 

[Verse 2: Khalid]
At times I wonder why I fool with you
But this is new to me, this is new to you
Initially, I didn't wanna fall for you
Gather my attention it was all for you, so don't
Take advantage, don't leave my heart damaged
To understand that things go a little bit better when you plan it... oh
So won't you

[Chorus: Khalid]
Send me your location, let's
Focus on communicating
'Cause I just need the time and place to come through
Send me your location
Let's ride the vibrations
I don't need nothing else but you 

[Verse 3: Kehlani]
Drop me a pin, let's fall
Way deeper into whatever we're callin' it
Whatever we're fallin' into
'Cause I don't really care about rules 
I don't really care about rules 
I just really care about you 
I'm enjoyin' starin' into 
Your eyes when I'm all in it with you
They can choose to watch, but I'd rather they just listen
Could fill up an album with everything that they're missin'
They so superficial, don't understand how we're chillin'
We don't need a lot, we got us and that's why we're winnin'
To them it's a park bench, us a magic carpet
Little trips to Target turn to avant garde shit
I promise, we got this, we got this
Baby just send me your

[Chorus: Khalid & Kehlani]
Send me your location, let's
Focus on communicating
'Cause I just need the time and place to come through 
Time and place to come through
Send me your location
Let's ride the vibrations
I don't need nothing else but you 
Nothing else, but you

[Outro: Khalid, Kehlani & Lil Wayne]
Ride, ride, ride, come and vibe with me tonight
Ride, ride
I don't need nothing else but you

Ride, ride, ride, come and vibe with me tonight
Ride, ride.... tonight
I don't need nothing else but you
But you, but you
Nothing else but you
But you

Do, do, do, do, do, do
Do, do, do, do, do, do
Do, do, do, do, do, do
Oh, oh, mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, mmm, mmm, mmm
Do, do, do, do, do, do, do
Do, do, do, do, do, do, do
Do, do, do, do, do, do
Do, do, do, do, do, do
Oh, I don't need nothing else but you

[Verse 1]
You'd rather speak more than listen
And that's based off our first impression
I'm new to all this affection
But I'm going in the right direction
Floating through different dimensions
But not losing sense of religion
Honey, I forgot to mention
I'm so entranced by you, it hurts

[Chorus]
I'm in love with the moment
See me floatin', see me glowin'
I'm in love with the moment
See me floatin', see me glowin'

[Verse 2]
Can't let me go if I'm fallin'
I've been on the path of importance
Let the love pull you in slowly
The river is running, we're flowing
I'm coming down, you've been rollin'
And we're letting free, now we're open
Pour me a, pour me a potion
I'm rocking, I'm rocking the motion

[Chorus]
I'm in love with the moment
See me floatin', see me glowin'
I'm in love with the moment
See me floatin', see me glowin'

[Outro]
Nothing feels better than this
Now, left, right, left, right
Take it back, bring it side to side
Like that, like that, ayy
Ooh, now, left, right, left, right
Take it back, bring it side to side
Like
Nothing feels better than this
Now, left, right, left, right
Take it back, bring it side to side
Like that, like that, ayy
Ooh, now, left, right, left, right
Take it back, bring it side to side
Like
Nothing feels better than this

That made me feel like I'm just speeding, doing 60 in a 35
We're sitting in a car and just holding hands

[Verse 1]
Got my headlights off, we're sittin' outside
If you climb in my car, then we're hereallnight, ooh
A coupleblunts rolled and I got mywindows down
Shorty, it's been a while since you've been this high

[Pre-Chorus]
If you're waitin' on love, then you waitin' for a while
If your neighbors wake up, then we gotta turn it down
So you say I'm the type you like keepin' around
You like keepin' around

[Chorus]
Late at night, eleven, we're cruisin'
Lately, I've been watchin' your movements
If I'm the only one that you're choosin'
Am I your favorite drug you've been usin'?
Late at night, eleven, we're crusin'
Lately, I've been watchin' your movements
If I'm the only one that you're choosin'
Am I your favorite drug you've been usin'?

[Verse 2]
21s sittin' on my M5 
Ride around summer, all-wheel-drive, yeah
Couple blunts in and I got my windows down
Lookin' real nice in my passenger side

[Pre-Chorus]
If you're waitin' on love, then you waitin' for a while
If your neighbors wake up, then we gotta turn it down
So you say I'm the type you like keepin' around
You like keepin' around

[Chorus]
Late at night, eleven, we're cruisin'
Lately, I've been watchin' your movements
If I'm the only one that you're choosin'
Am I your favorite drug you've been usin'?
Late at night, eleven, we're cruisin'
Lately, I've been watchin' your movements
If I'm the only one that you're choosin'
Am I your favorite drug you've been usin'?

[Bridge]
Ooh, don't you forget about me
Ooh, don't you forget about me
Ooh, don't you forget about me
Ooh, don't forget about me
Ooh, don't you forget about me
Ooh, don't forget about me, yeah
Ooh, don't you forget about me
Ooh, don't you forget about me

[Chorus]
Late at night, eleven, we're cruisin'

If I'm the only one that you're choosin'
Am I your favorite drug you've been usin'?

[Outro]
Don't you forget about me
If I'm the only one that you're
Am I your favorite drug you've been usin', usin'?
If I'm the only one that you're
Am I your favorite drug you've been usin', usin'?
Don't you forget about me
If I'm the only one that you're
Am I your favorite drug you've been usin', usin'?
If I'm the only one that you're
Am I your favorite drug you've been usin', usin'?

[Verse 1]
Roses were your favorite flower
And I couldn't stand the scent
But if it's what it takes to put a smile on your face
I guess I'll deal with it
You hung with the popular kids
And I couldn't stand them
But I sucked it up, because I wanted to be more than friends

[Chorus]
You should walk away with me
In your heart
Keep me in your mind
You don't have to speak
Of our past, just
Keep me in your life
Keep me alive
Keep me alive
Keep me alive
Keep me alive
Keep me alive
Keep me alive
Ohhhhh
Nooooo
Ohhhhh
Nooooo

[Verse 2]
We were ridin' down Dyer with my top down
Singin' our favorite songs
But the funny thing is
Every time we did, you'd always get the words wrong
And I was your biggest fan
You should never forget it
I bet your new man
Doesn't love you like I did
Does he love you like I did?
Does he love you like I did?
Noooo

[Chorus]
You should walk away with me
In your heart
Keep me in your mind
You don't have to speak
Of our past, just
Keep me in your life
Keep me alive

[Bridge]
Keep me alive
Keep me alive
Keep me alive
Keep me alive
Keep me alive
Keep me alive
Keep me alive
Keep me alive
Ohhhhh
Nooooo
Ohhhhh
Nooooo

[Outro]
You should walk away with me
In your heart
Keep me in your mind
You don't have to speak
Of our past, just
Keep me in your life
Keep me alive
Keep me alive
Keep me alive
Keep me alive
Keep me alive
Keep me alive
Ohhhhh
Nooooo
Ohhhhh
Nooooo

[Intro]
Mmm, mmm
Oh yeah, oh yeah, yeah
Alright

[Verse 1]
Dont save me, I'm in no need of saving 
And if you stay with me, I know you need patience 
Blood and cologne on the fragrance 
'Cause if ya deal with me, I know you know what pain is 

[Pre-Chorus]
So if you're gonna love me
You gotta love all of me
You gotta love, deeper than that
Now, if you're gonna leave me
You better run far away
Id hate for you to leave me attached

[Chorus]
'Cause I'm in love with bad luck
Im in love with bad luck
Move too close, get caught up
Move too close, get caught up
I'm in love with bad luck
I'm in love with bad luck
Move too close, get caught up
Move too close, get caught up
I'm in love with bad luck 

[Verse 2]
And I don't even like to think about it
On my own, but still so crowded
Walls come down and the guards come up
But there's nowhere to run, I feel surrounded
Hurt feels better when I'm by myself
No one really means it when they're wishing you well
I got no one to call, no one
And people only love you when they're needing your wealth
Damn, laying down, staring at my ceiling fan
Everybody acting like they give a damn
Where is everybody when you need a hand?
I've been burning rubber on the Michelin
Flying in the rain like I'm Superman
I could say I love it, but that just depends

[Chorus]
'Cause I'm in love with bad luck
Im in love with bad luck
Move too close, get caught up
Move too close, get caught up
I'm in love with bad luck
I'm in love with bad luck
Move too close, get caught up
Move too close, get caught up
I'm in love

[Pre-Chorus]
So if you're gonna love me
You gotta love all of me
You gotta love, deeper than that
Now, if you're gonna leave me
You better run far away
Id hate for you to leave me attached

[Chorus]
'Cause I'm in love with bad luck
Im in love with bad luck
Move too close, get caught up
Move too close, get caught up
I'm in love with bad luck
I'm in love with bad luck
Move too close, get caught up
Move too close, get caught up
I'm in love with bad luck

[Outro]
Yeah 
Bad, bad luck

[Verse 1]
Power
Got me sittin' by my phone, Ive been waiting for hours
On my line, sending mirror pics of you fresh out the shower
So I might as well swing over to your place 
Its crowded
In LA, but Ill be there at 8 if the traffic allows it
Say youre down, I could show you around
If youre really about it, yeah
But for you, I got something to prove, what do you say?
What do you say?

[Chorus]
Should we bring it right back?
Honestly, it's better like that
I know we've been falling off track
Bring it right back
I just let the time roll past
We don't gotta take it too fast
Bring it right back
You don't gotta stay the night
I just wanna take the time
I know all the things you like
Maybe if the mood is right
We can bring it right back

[Verse 2]
Saved
Got the weed, we can sit by the beach if we wanna get faded
But if that's not the vibe, yeah, its cool
We can save it for later, yeah
I just like the way it feels when you're around
When you're around, ah
Now I know we're not dating, nah
Maybe soon by the way things go, weve been talking for ages
Take it step by step, slow it down, we just need to be patient, love
If the love feels good and it's real, it'll all work out
It'll all work out, yeah

[Chorus]
Should we bring it right back?
Honestly, it's better like that
I know we've been falling off track
Bring it right back
I just let the time roll past
We don't gotta take it too fast
Bring it right back
You don't gotta stay the night
I just wanna take the time
I know all the things you like
Maybe if the mood is right
We can bring it right back

[Bridge]
So bring it, so bring it
So bring it, so bring it
So bring it, so bring it 
So bring it, so bring it back 
So bring it, so bring it 
So bring it, so bring it 
So bring it, so bring it 
So bring it, so bring it back
So bring it, so bring it 
So bring it, so bring it
So bring it, so bring it
So bring it, so bring it back 

[Chorus]
Should we bring it right back?
Honestly, it's better like that
I know we've been falling off track
Bring it right back
I just let the time roll past
We don't gotta take it too fast
Bring it right back
You don't gotta stay the night
I just wanna take the time
I know all the things you like
Maybe if the mood is right
We can bring it right back
Honestly, it's better like that
I know we've been falling off track
Bring it right back
I just let the time roll past
We don't gotta take it too fast
Bring it right back
You don't gotta stay the night
I just wanna take the time
I know all the things you like
Maybe if the mood is right
We can bring it right

[Verse 1]
I've ran away for miles
It's gettin' hard for me to breathe
'Cause the man that I've been runnin' from is inside of me
I tell him keep it quiet
So hardly does he speak
'Cause he wants to keep his distance
But it's hard for him to leave
He knows I hear him cryin'
Cryin' out for help
I don't know how to save him
I can't even save myself
There's many people dyin'
I've always been afraid
Not that I'm scared of livin'
I'm scared of feeling pain

[Chorus]
I don't need another hand, I need a couple suggestions
Always had a little trouble with self-reflections
Now, does my raw emotion make me less of a man? Hmm
Always had a little trouble with self-reflections

[Verse 2]
I've been so used to winnin'
It was hard for me to lose
No, there's nothing wrong with me
There's just something wrong with you
So I've been making changes
Been workin' on my health
No more competition
Can't compete against myself, no, no, no
I'm not doin' this to be loved, no, no
I've been doin' this to be remembered
Let the people hear it if they want to
Help the one's around me get it on, too
If I die tomorrow and I'm gone
Let the blood run high
Let the carpets drown
I'll be forever now

[Chorus]
I don't need another hand, I need a couple suggestions
Always had a little trouble with self-reflections
Now, does my raw emotion make me less of a man? Hmm
Always had a little trouble with self-reflections
I don't need another hand, I need a couple suggestions
Always had a little trouble with self-reflections
Now, does my raw emotion make me less of a man? Hmm
Always had a little trouble with self-reflections

[Outro]
Let this be a promise
That when it's said and done
Be a flower in the garden
Be one with the sun
Be one with the sun
Be one with the sun
Be one with the sun
Be one with the sun

[Intro: A Boogie wit da Hoodie]
Ooh

[Verse 1: A Boogie wit da Hoodie]
Watch 'nother Richard
It's a million plus three reasons I lied
I couldn't admit it
And I just don't want you to waste my time
'Cause I'm tryna get with ya
I be feelin' down but I'm fine when I'm with ya
You be thinkin' I be lyin' when I say I miss you
Girl, you know I'm on your body, on your body like a tissue
They be callin' you Illuminati when I'm with you 
I say, "Maybe, it's your third eye," I love your mental 
VVS's on me look like Now and Laters, lick you up
I bet you never go back to the guy that was with you 
She got every pair of Chanel out of SoHo
Tribeca, hit the city to show off
And when you get dressed up, you take hours
Baby girl, you know you can do whatever, you got...

[Verse 2: Khalid]
Power
Got me sittin' by my phone, I've been waiting for hours
On my line, sending mirror pics of you fresh out the shower
So I might as well swing over to your place, mmh, nah
It's crowded
In LA, but I'll be there at 8 if the traffic allows it
Say you're down, I could show you around if you're really about it, yeah
But for you, I got something to prove, what do you say?
What do you say?

So bring it, so bring it
So bring it, so bring it back 

[Chorus: Khalid]

[Verse 1]
Take me 'round the world and back again
As I'm searching for my soul out there
Oh,there'ssomething that I'mwondering 
Where I'm going when mystory ends

[Pre-Chorus]
Doesn't even matter anyway, no, we're
Focused and I'm coping with the pain, yeah, we're
Only getting older by the day, yeah, we're
Only getting older 
Doesn't even matter anyway, no, we're
Focused and I'm coping with the pain, yeah, we're
Only getting older by the day, yeah, we're
Only getting older 

[Chorus]
Keeps me up all night
Keeps me
Get these thoughts that keep me up all night
Keeps me
Keeps me up all night
Keeps me
Get these thoughts that keep me up all night
Keeps me

[Verse 2]
So I'ma light it up, I'm gettin high 
Ask me how I am, I'm getting by 
But I'm thankful that I'm still alive 
'Cause there's so much more I'm left to find

[Pre-Chorus]
Doesn't even matter anyway, no, we're
Focused and I'm coping with the pain, yeah, we're
Only getting older by the day, yeah, we're
Only getting older 
Doesn't even matter anyway, no, we're
Focused and I'm coping with the pain, yeah, we're
Only getting older by the day, yeah, we're
Only getting older 

[Chorus]
Keeps me up all night
Keeps me
Get these thoughts that keep me up all night
Keeps me up 
Keeps me up all night
Keeps me 
Get these thoughts that keep me up all night
Keeps me up 

[Bridge]
On my mind all the time
Keepin' me up all night
On my mind all the time
Keepin' me up all night
On my mind all the time, ah

[Outro]
Keeps me up all night
Keeps me

[Verse 1]
We were running onto something
And we didn't say "forever," but it's all we wanted
You were so in love with simple things
And now we're searching for the fire dripped in kerosene
I've been loving more, living less
Off of highs and lows, so obsessed
Couldn't get nothin
But we're never running out

[Chorus]
We'll be free spirits, free spirits
Can you hear me calling?
Oh, it's all or nothing
When you're free spirits, free spirits
Can you hear it calling?
'Cause I don't wanna live and die alone, don't let me go

[Verse 2]
Is this Heaven or Armageddon?
I'll be gettin' high with you to watch the endin'
We were drownin' down our memories
A cemetery full of bottles, man, that liquor bleed
When you're loving more, caring less
It's the highs and lows with no regrets, oh
And we wanted it all then
But we're never running out

[Chorus]
We'll be free spirits, free spirits
Can you hear me calling?
Oh, it's all or nothing
When you're free spirits, free spirits
Can you hear it calling?
'Cause I don't wanna live and die alone, don't let me go

[Bridge]
So tell me when you're falling
No, I can never doubt your love
Can you hear me calling?
Is it everything you're dreaming of?
Leave it all on the night
As long as you're not leaving me behind
On your heart, your heart, ah

[Outro]
Free spirits, free spirit
Free spirits, free spirit

[Verse 1]
Life is never easy when you need it to be
Try to knock me down, but I get back on my feet
Everybody's angry and they're coming for me 
But I can't give them energy that I won't receive 
So I brush 'em off, I got a lot on my sleeve
Like I'm moving backwards, but it's all on repeat
This place is getting crowded, I got no room to breathe
I hope the only thing I'm losing isn't my memory

[Chorus]
'Cause the world keeps spinning, the sun won't shine on my face
I'ma keep it moving, got a hundred things I gotta do today
'Cause the world keeps spinning, the sun won't shine on my face
I'ma keep it moving, got a hundred things I gotta do today

[Verse 2]
Now it's real, take your time, you're almost there
Wherever were going, gotta be prepared
Well be fine, are you scared? Are you scared?
People keep on talking 'bout what they wanna be
Walking down the line, but they dont live what they preach 
Sharing attributes with all our own enemies
You gotta pay to live and even dying ain't free

[Chorus]
'Cause the world keeps spinning, the sun won't shine on my face

I'ma keep it moving, got a hundred things I gotta do today

'Cause the world keeps spinning, the sun won't shine on my face

I'ma keep it moving, got a hundred things I gotta do today, yeah

[Bridge]
You gotta take it slow 
Dust yourself off, dont you lose control 
Gotta take it slow
Dust yourself off, dont you lose control

You gotta take it slow 
Dust yourself off, dont you lose control

Gotta take it slow
Dust yourself off, dont you lose control


[Chorus]
'Cause the world keeps spinning, the sun won't shine on my face

[Outro]
Outta sight, outta mind, got no time
So blind, hundred days and I'm still alive, what a life
Outta sight, outta mind, got no time
So blind, hundred days and I'm still alive, what a life
Hundred days and I'm still alive
Hundred days and I'm still alive
Its been a hundred, mmm
Hundred, hundred days and I'm still alive
Had a hundred friends, but I cut em off, I dont need em
Not like any of them gave a fuck if I was breathing
Summer's over so they switching around like the seasons
Gotta keep my guard up, now I'm playing defense
Everybody wants a favor, everybody needs me
But I'm too busy trying to fight away all of my demons
I'm too busy trying to fight away all of my demons
Everybody wants a favor, everybody needs me
Outta sight, outta mind, got no time
So blind, hundred days and I'm still alive, what a life
Outta sight, outta mind, got no time
So blind, hundred days and I'm still alive, what a life
Hundred days and I'm still alive
Hundred days and I'm still alive
Its been a hundred, mmm
Hundred, hundred days and I'm still alive

[Verse 1: Khalid]
I feel like I'm losing you whenever I'm offline
Though I never had you, I used to pretend that you're mine
I feel like there's nothing for me here, but still, I try
I feel like there's nothing for me here, but still, I try
Bruising my finger hitting your line
If I'm holding back, I might just lose my mind 

[Chorus: Khalid & SAFE]
Keeping my phone alive 
Hoping that you call this time 
Thought I heard your ringing 
You know I hear things sometimes
Call my line, call my line
Come alive, come alive
Show me, don't pretend
Show me, don't pretend
Show me, don't pretend

[Verse 2: Khalid]
Keepin' you on my radar
Lately, you're so damn cold
You used to hold me down
You're far, so it's been a while
I still remember your voice
How you talk so soft in the morning
You're the only one I'm wanting
Love stays still and I'm frozen
But I'm opening thoughts that I keep within
I guess I gotta be a man
I tried as hard as I can

[Chorus: Khalid & SAFE]
Keeping my phone alive 
Hoping that you call this time
Thought I heard you ringin'
You know I hear things sometimes
Call my line, call my line
Come alive, come alive
Show me, don't pretend
Show me, don't pretend
Show me, don't pretend
Show me, don't pretend
Show me, don't pretend 
Show me, don't pretend 
Show me, don't pretend

[Verse 1: Khalid]
So you're still thinking of me
Just like I know you should
I can not give you everything, you know I wish I could
I'm so high at the moment
I'm so caught up in this
Yeah, we're just young, dumb and broke
But we still got love to give

[Chorus: Khalid]
While we're young dumb
Young, young dumb and broke
Young dumb
Young, young dumb and broke
Young dumb
Young, young dumb and broke
Young dumb broke high school kids
Yadadadadadadada
Yadadadadadada
Yadadadadadadada
Young dumb broke high school kids

[Verse 2: Swae Lee]
We kept our last few hundreds 
Spread out just like a fan 
She memorized my number 
Same one from 2010 
And we're living it up, forget about sorrow 
Party all night 
Same time tomorrow
Keeping my cool 
Making my moves 
Young, dumb and broke, dreams coming true

[Chorus: Khalid]
While we're young dumb
Young, young dumb and broke
Young dumb
Young, young dumb and broke
Young dumb
Young, young dumb and broke
Young dumb broke high school kids
Yadadadadadadada
Yadadadadadada
Yadadadadadadada
Young dumb broke high school kids

[Verse 3: Khalid & Slim Jxmmi]
We have so much in common
We argue all the time
You always say I'm wrong
I'm pretty sure I'm right
What's fun about commitment?
When we have our life to live 
Yeah, we're just young dumb and broke 
But we still got love to give 

[Verse 4: Slim Jxmmi]
Never thought it would be like this 
I never thought it could be like this 
Remember when I used to drive the hooptie, oh yeah 
I'm coming in that Lamb' I'm 'bout to scoop you, oh yeah
I know the last time that you see me I was broke 
Pull up for my city, graduated blue and gold 
Don't tell me how to do it, you ain't did this shit before 
Y'all niggas winning if you watching peep the scope 
We get it while we young dumb

[Chorus: Khalid and Lil Yachty]
While we're young dumb
Young, young dumb and broke
Young dumb
Young, young dumb and broke
Young dumb
Young, young dumb and broke
Young dumb broke high school kids
Yadadadadadadada
Yadadadadadada
Yadadadadadadada 
Young dumb broke high school kids 

[Verse 5: Lil Yachty]
Young, dumb and broke 
Back in high school Boat was so emotional
Now I'm super rich and everything I do is so promotional 
I didn't finish college, so my momma thought I wouldn't be shit
I had to prove her wrong 
That's why I talk about her now in every single song
Had to struggle for a while 
Just so I could live it up when it's time to live 
I knew something had to give 
Broke as hell using Lyft 
I could never get a lift, now they all want one from me 
Stay away from the fiends, message from the King of the Teens

[Chorus: Khalid and Lil Yachty]
While we're young dumb
Young, young dumb and broke 
Young dumb
Young, young dumb and broke
Young dumb 
Young, young dumb and broke
Young dumb broke high school kids 
Yadadadadadadada
Yadadadadadada
It's the American Teen and the King of the Teens
Yadadadadadadada
Young dumb broke high school kids

[Intro]
Say you can't deal with me no more, just say you don't want me
I never know what you feel no more, just say you don't want me
Say you can't deal with me no more, just say you don't want me
I never know what you feel no more, just say you don't want me

[Verse]
It's been too much, I've been on the side and I'm waiting
Got a little time, maybe all night, if I'm patient
What's on your mind? I can never read you 
No, I always leave you crying when we fight, but I don't mean to, yeah
No, no, love don't come easy
Especially when you're loving me, yeah
It's never enough for the both of us, so sorry
Couldnt have known it would ever be this hard
Ooh, we had it all, but we lost and that's our fault
I should be here waiting for you to answer my calls, no
But I'm never giving up on word, I've been
I've been focusing on putting me first
Still could never see you with somebody else
I can't even live with being by myself
That's the part of me that really needs your help
Lately, I haven't been doing very well
That's the difference between heaven and hell
I feel heaven when you're here with me
I feel hell every time you leave
But I need to get you off of my back
I gotta get you off of my back
We said we would never take it this far
Here we are, going back and forth
I hoped we would never make it this far
But now, I gotta find my worth

[Outro]
Say you don't love me no more, just say you don't want me

We don't gotta be no more if you really don't want to

Say you can't deal with me no more, just say you don't want me

I never know what you feel no more, just say you don't want me
We don't gotta be, we don't gotta be, yeah, no more
We don't gotta be no more, no more, no more, no more, no

[Intro]
Mmm, mmm
Mmm, yeah

[Verse 1]
You go searching for paradise
You sit back and close your eyes
We're burning, yet so alive
And now you've got your hands up
Hoping you catch the high
Feels like the summer time
Chasing the northern lights, oh
Don't like watching your momma cry
You say you'd rather die
She says you're wasting your life

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, life dont stop the more we pray
All your wrongs from yesterday
Smokin himalayan haze
Wont wash all your sins away

[Chorus]
Hate dont give
Love dont rewind all the good times
All the dollars youll spend
Give it up for nights like this
Dont give into overthinking
Pour a drink when it ends

[Verse 2]
Do you hear me through your speakers
So much distance, space between us
Say you're dreaming and Ive been, too
And no-one knows what youve been through
And I've been thinking a little deeper
Contemplation, getting cleaner
See no leaders, need more teachers
I'm in shambles, I don't sleep much

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, life dont stop the more we pray
All your wrongs from yesterday
Smokin himalayan haze
Wont wash all your sins away

[Chorus]
Hate dont give
Love dont rewind all the good times
All the dollars youll spend
Give it up for nights like this
Dont give into overthinking
Pour a drink when it ends 

[Outro]
Yeah, yeah

[Verse 1]
Unread texts and missed calls
Told everyone I turned my phone off
Didn't ask for help and now Im lost
Life comes in phases 
Consequences and mistakes
I'm sorry that it's taken me so long

[Pre-Chorus]
Mister, mister, please let off your power
Give me half an hour, or better yet, a full
Only sweet until it all goes sour
But life is what you make it, and then theres more to lose

[Chorus]
Gatekeeper, can you show me more to life?
Lately, I've been living out of spite
Grim Reaper, just give me one more night
I need another chance to say goodbye
I shouldn't have to die to feel alive

[Verse 2]
Here's the thing with disappearing
You can yell and no one hears you
Times like this, I need an ear
When I finally have so much to say
Wish I could see your face, oh
And do what I have to stop the tears

[Pre-Chorus]
Sister, sister, please know that I'm sorry
I wish you could've stopped me from falling off the hill
Only sweet until it all goes sour
But life is what you make it until it gets too real

[Chorus]
Gatekeeper, can you show me more to life?
Lately, I've been living out of spite
Grim reaper, just give me one more night
I need another chance to say goodbye
I shouldn't have to die to feel alive

[Verse 1]
Oh, oh, oh, oh
In the back of my mind I know it's hard on us
But to tell you the truth there's no more love, no more love
It's not easy to say, Im giving up
And I've been losing count

[Pre-Chorus]
When the seconds turn to minutes into hours
You've been working 9 to 5
So it was hard to find the time for me, yeah
Are we gonna be alright
If I come through tonight

[Chorus]
Baby can I stay a while
It's hard to say goodbye when I'm leaving, yeah
Let me inside, dim down the lights
Just know I'm coming home for a reason
Baby can I stay a while
It's hard to say goodbye when I'm leaving, yeah
Let me inside, dim down the lights
Just know I'm coming home for a reason
Baby can I stay a while

[Verse 2]
Nahh, All the shit that you say, do you mean it?
And when you tell me you love me do you believe it?
I can see it in your eyes you've had enough of it
And I've been missing out

[Pre-Chorus]
When the seconds turn to minutes into hours
Working 9 to 5 cause it's hard to find the time for me, yeah
Are we gonna be alright
If I come through tonight, yeah

[Chorus]
Baby can I stay a while
It's hard to say goodbye when I'm leaving, yeah
Let me inside, dim down the lights
Just know I'm coming home for a reason
Baby can I stay a while
It's hard to say goodbye when I'm leaving, yeah
Let me inside, dim down the lights
Just know I'm coming home for a reason

[Chorus]
Baby can I stay a while
It's hard to say goodbye when I'm leaving, yeah
Let me inside, dim down the lights
Just know I'm coming home for a reason
Baby can I stay a while
It's hard to say goodbye when I'm leaving, yeah
Let me inside, dim down the lights
Just know I'm coming home for a reason
Baby can I stay a while

[Intro: Post Malone]
Hahahahaha
Tank God
Ayy, ayy

[Chorus: Post Malone]
I've been fuckin' hoes and poppin' pillies
Man, I feel just like a rockstar 
All my brothers got that gas
And they always be smokin' like a Rasta 
Fuckin' with me, call up on a Uzi
And show up, man, them the shottas 
When my homies pull up on your block
They make that thing go grrra-ta-ta-ta 

[Verse 1: Post Malone]
Switch my whip, came back in black
I'm startin' sayin', "Rest in peace to Bon Scott" 
Close that door, we blowin' smoke
She ask me light a fire like I'm Morrison 
Act a fool on stage
Prolly leave my fuckin' show in a cop car 
Shit was legendary
Threw a TV out the window of the Montage
Cocaine on the table, liquor pourin', don't give a damn
Dude, your girlfriend is a groupie, she just tryna get in
Sayin', "I'm with the band" 
Now she actin' outta pocket, tryna grab up on my pants
Hundred bitches in my trailer say they ain't got a man
And they all brought a friend 

[Chorus: Post Malone]
I've been fuckin' hoes and poppin' pillies
Man, I feel just like a rockstar 
All my brothers got that gas
And they always be smokin' like a Rasta 
Fuckin' with me, call up on a Uzi
And show up, man, them the shottas 
When my homies pull up on your block
They make that thing go grrra-ta-ta-ta 

[Verse 2: 21 Savage]
I've been in the Hills fuckin' superstars
Feelin' like a popstar 
Drankin' Henny, bad bitches jumpin' in the pool
And they ain't got on no bra 
Hit her from the back, pullin' on her tracks
And now she screamin' out, "No ms!" 
They like, "Savage, why you got a 12 car garage
And you only got six cars?" 
I ain't with the cakin', how you kiss that? 
Your wifey say I'm lookin' like a whole snack 
Green hundreds in my safe, I got old racks 
L.A. bitches always askin', "Where the coke at?" 
Livin' like a rockstar, smash out on a cop car
Sweeter than a Pop-Tart, you know you are not hard
I done made the hot chart, 'member I used to trap hard
Livin' like a rockstar, I'm livin' like a rockstar 

[Chorus: Post Malone & 21 Savage]
I've been fuckin' hoes and poppin' pillies
Man, I feel just like a rockstar 
All my brothers got that gas
And they always be smokin' like a Rasta 
Fuckin' with me, call up on a Uzi
And show up, man, them the shottas 
When my homies pull up on your block
They make that thing go grrra-ta-ta-ta

[Chorus: Post Malone]
My momma called, seen you on TV, son
Said shit done changed ever since we was on
I dreamed it all ever since I was young
They said I wouldn't be nothing
Now they always say, "Congratulations" 
Worked so hard, forgot how to vacation 
They ain't never had the dedication 
People hatin', say we changed and look, we made it 
Yeah, we made it 

[Verse 1: Post Malone]
They was never friendly, yeah
Now I'm jumping out the Bentley, yeah
And I know I sound dramatic, yeah
But I know I had to have it, yeah
For the money, I'm a savage, yeah
I be itching like a addict, yeah
I'm surrounded, twenty bad bitches, yeah
But they didn't know me last year, yeah
Everyone wanna act like they important 
But all that mean nothing when I saw my dough, yuh 
Everyone countin' on me, drop the ball, yuh 
Everything custom like I'm at the border, yeah, yeah
If you fuck with winning, put your lighters to the sky
How could I make cents when I got millions on my mind?
Coming with that bullshit, I just put it to the side
Balling since a baby, they could see it in my eyes

[Chorus: Post Malone & Quavo]
My momma called, seen you on TV, son
Said shit done changed ever since we was on
I dreamed it all ever since I was young
They said I wouldn't be nothing
Now they always say, "Congratulations" 
Worked so hard, forgot how to vacation 
They ain't never had the dedication 
People hatin', say we changed and look we made it 
Yeah, we made it 

[Verse 2: Quavo]
I was patient 
I was patient 
Now I can scream that we made it 
Now everywhere, everywhere I go, they say 'gratulation 
Young nigga, young nigga, graduation 
I pick up the rock and I ball, baby 
I'm looking for someone to call, baby 
But right now, I got a situation 
Never old Ben-Ben Franklins 
Big rings , champagne 
My life is like a ball game 
But instead, I'm in the trap though 
Pot so big, call it Super Bowl 
Super Bowl, call the hoes , get in the Rolls 
Top-floor lifestyle , Huncho and Post 
Malone , I gotta play on my phone 
You know what I'm on , Huncho Houdini is gone 

[Chorus: Post Malone & Quavo]
My momma called, seen you on TV, son

[Chorus: Post Malone]
Damn, my AP goin' psycho, lil' mama bad like Michael
Can't really trust nobody with all this jewelry on you
My roof look like a no-show, got diamonds by the boatload
Come with the Tony Romo for clowns and all the bozos
My AP goin' psycho, lil' mama bad like Michael
Can't really trust nobody with all this jewelry on you
My roof look like a no-show, got diamonds by the boatload
Don't act like you my friend when I'm rollin' through my ends, though

[Verse 1: Post Malone]
You stuck in the friend zone, I tell that four-five the fifth, ayy
Hunnid bands inside my shorts, DeChino the shit, ayy
Try to stuff it all in, but it don't even fit, ayy
Know that I been with the shits ever since a jit, ayy
I made my first million, I'm like, "Shit, this is it," ayy
30 for a walkthrough, man, we had that bitch lit, ayy
Had so many bottles, gave ugly girl a sip
Out the window of the Benzo, we get seen in the rent'
And I'm like "Whoa, man, my neck so goddamn cold
Diamonds wet, my t-shirt soaked
I got homies, let it go, oh
My money thick, won't ever fold
She said, "Can I have some to hold?"
And I can't ever tell you no

[Chorus: Post Malone]
Damn, my AP goin' psycho, lil' mama bad like Michael
Can't really trust nobody with all this jewelry on you
My roof look like a no-show, got diamonds by the boatload
Come with the Tony Romo for clowns and all the bozos
My AP goin' psycho, lil' mama bad like Michael
Can't really trust nobody with all this jewelry on you
My roof look like a no-show, got diamonds by the boatload
Don't act like you my friend when I'm rollin' through my ends, though

[Verse 2: Ty Dolla $ign]
The AP goin' psycho, my Rollie goin' brazy
I'm hittin' lil' mama, she wanna have my babies
It's fifty on the pinky, chain so stanky
You should see the whip, promise I can take yo' bitch
Dolla ridin' in an old school Chevy, it's a drop top
Boolin' with a thot-thot, she gon' give me top-top
Just one switch, I can make the ass drop 
Ayy, take you to the smoke shop
We gon' get high, ayy, we gon' hit Rodeo
Dial up Valentino, we gon' hit Pico
Take you where I'm from, take you to the slums
This ain't happen overnight, no, these diamonds real bright
Saint Laurent jeans, still in my Vans though
All VVS', put you in a necklace
Girl, you look beautiful tonight
Stars on the roof, they matching with the jewelry

[Chorus: Post Malone]
Damn, my AP goin' psycho, lil' mama bad like Michael

Don't act like you my friend when I'm rollin' through my ends, though

[Intro]
Ooh, I fall apart
Ooh, yeah, mmm, yeah

[Verse 1]
She told me that I'm not enough 
And she left me with a broken heart 
She fooled me twice and it's all my fault 
She cut too deep, now she left me scarred 
Now there's so many thoughts goin' through my brain 
And now I'm takin' these shots like it's Novocaine, yeah

[Chorus]
Ooh, I fall apart
Down to my core
Ooh, I fall apart
Down to my core
Ooh, didn't know it before
Surprised when you caught me off guard
All this damn jewelry I bought
You was my shorty, I thought

[Verse 2]
Never caught a feelin' this hard
Harder than the liquor I pour
Tell me you don't want me no more
But I can't let go, everybody told me so
Feelin' like I sold my soul
Devil in the form of a whore
Devil in the form of a whore
You said it, no, you said it
No, you said that shit, we'd be together, oh

[Chorus]
Ooh, I fall apart
Down to my core
Ooh, I fall apart
Down to my core
Ooh, didn't know it before
Surprised when you caught me off guard
All this damn jewelry I bought
You was my shorty, I thought

[Bridge]
Ice keep pourin' and the drink keep flowin'
Try to brush it off, but it keep on goin'
Covered in scars and I can't help showin'
Whippin' in the foreign and the tears keep rollin'
Ice keep droppin' and the drink keep flowin'
Try to brush it off, but it keep on goin'
All these scars, can't help from showin'
Whippin' in the foreign and the tears keep blowin', yeah

[Chorus]
Ooh, I fall apart
Down to my core
Ooh, I fall apart
Down to my core
Ooh, didn't know it before
Surprised when you caught me off guard
All this damn jewelry I bought
You was my shorty, I thought

[Chorus]
You prolly think that you are better now, better now
You only say that 'cause I'm not around, not around
You know I never meant to let you down, let you down
Woulda gave you anything, woulda gave you everything
You know I say that I am better now, better now
I only say that 'cause you're not around, not around
You know I never meant to let you down, let you down
Woulda gave you anything, woulda gave you everything
Oh-oh

[Verse 1]
I did not believe that it would end, no
Everything came second to the Benzo
You're not even speakin' to my friends, no
You knew all my uncles and my aunts though
Twenty candles, blow 'em out and open your eyes
We were lookin' forward to the rest of our lives
Used to keep my picture posted by your bedside
Now it's in your dresser with the socks you don't like
And I'm rollin', rollin', rollin', rollin'
With my brothers like it's Jonas, Jonas
Drinkin' Henny and I'm tryna forget
But I can't get this shit outta my head

[Chorus]
You prolly think that you are better now, better now
You only say that 'cause I'm not around, not around
You know I never meant to let you down, let you down
Woulda gave you anything, woulda gave you everything
You know I say that I am better now, better now
I only say that 'cause you're not around, not around
You know I never meant to let you down, let you down
Woulda gave you anything, woulda gave you everything
Oh-oh

[Verse 2]
I seen you with your other dude
He seemed like he was pretty cool
I was so broken over you
Life, it goes on, what can you do?
I just wonder what it's gonna take 
Another foreign or a bigger chain 
Because no matter how my life has changed
I keep on looking back on better days

[Chorus]
You prolly think that you are better now, better now
You only say that 'cause I'm not around, not around
You know I never meant to let you down, let you down
Woulda gave you anything, woulda gave you everything
You know I say that I am better now, better now
I only say that 'cause you're not around, not around
You know I never meant to let you down, let you down
Woulda gave you anything, woulda gave you everything
Oh-oh

[Bridge]
I promise
I swear to you, I'll be okay
You're only the love of my life 

[Chorus]
You prolly think that you are better now, better now
You only say that 'cause I'm not around, not around
You know I never meant to let you down, let you down
Woulda gave you anything, woulda gave you everything
You know I say that I am better now, better now
I only say that 'cause you're not around, not around
You know I never meant to let you down, let you down
Woulda gave you anything, woulda gave you everything
Oh-oh

[Intro]
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

[Verse 1]
We couldn't turn around 'til we were upside down
I'll be the bad guy now, but know I ain't too proud
I couldn't be there even when I tried
You don't believe it, we do this every time

[Chorus]
Seasons change and our love went cold
Feed the flame 'cause we can't let go
Run away, but we're running in circles
Run away, run away
I dare you to do something
I'm waiting on you again, so I don't take the blame
Run away, but we're running in circles
Run away, run away, run away

[Verse 2]
Let go, I got a feeling that it's time to let go
I said so, I knew that this was doomed from the get-go
You thought that it was special, special
But it was just the sex though, the sex though
And I still hear the echoes 
I got a feeling that it's time to let it go, let it go

[Chorus]
Seasons change and our love went cold
Feed the flame 'cause we can't let go
Run away, but we're running in circles
Run away, run away
I dare you to do something
I'm waiting on you again, so I don't take the blame
Run away, but we're running in circles
Run away, run away, run away

[Bridge]
Maybe you don't understand what I'm going through
It's only me, what you got to lose?
Make up your mind, tell me, what are you gonna do?
It's only me, let it go

[Chorus]
Seasons change and our love went cold
Feed the flame 'cause we can't let go
Run away, but we're running in circles
Run away, run away
I dare you to do something
I'm waiting on you again, so I don't take the blame
Run away, but we're running in circles
Run away, run away, run away

[Verse 1]
Said she tired of little money, need a big boy
Pull up 20 inch blades like I'm Lil Troy
Now it's everybody flockin', need a decoy
Shawty mixing up the vodka with the LaCroix, yeah
G-Wagen, G-Wagen, G-Wagen, G-Wagen
All the housewives pullin up 
I got a lot of toys, 720S bumpin' Fall Out Boy
You was talkin' shit in the beginning 
Back when I was feelin' more forgivin' 
I know it piss you off to see me winnin' 
See the igloo in my mouth when I be grinnin , yeah

[Chorus]
Hunnid bands in my pocket, it's on me
Hunnid deep when I roll like the army
Get more bottles, these bottles are lonely
Its a moment when I show up, got 'em sayin', "Wow" 
Hunnid bands in my pocket, it's on me 
Yeah, your grandmama probably know me 
Get more bottles, these bottles are lonely
Its a moment when I show up, got 'em sayin', "Wow" 

[Verse 2]
Everywhere I go 
Catch me on the block like I'm Mutombo 
750 Lambo in the Utah snow 
Trunk in the front like that shit Dumbo, yeah
Cut the roof off like a nip-tuck
Pull up to the house with some big butts
Turn the kitchen counter to a strip-club 
Me and Dre came for the...
When I got guap, all of y'all just appeared 
Before I dropped Stoney, none of y'all really cared 
Now they always say, "Congratulations," to the kid 
And this is not a 40, but I'm pourin' out this shit 
Used to have a lot, but I got more now 
Made another hit 'cause I got bored now 
Always goin' for it, never punt fourth down
Last call, Hail Mary, Prescott touchdown, ayy

[Chorus]
Hunnid bands in my pocket, it's on me 
Hunnid deep when I roll like the army 
Get more bottles, these bottles are lonely
It's a moment when I show up, got 'em sayin', "Wow" 
Hunnid bands in my pocket, it's on me 
Yeah, your grandmama probably know me 
Get more bottles, these bottles are lonely
It's a moment when I show up, got 'em sayin', "Wow"

[Outro]
Got 'em sayin', "Wow"
Ayy, ayy, wow
Sayin', "Wow"
Wow
Wow

[Verse 1]
It's true that all that you know is all that you are
You said that it's all that you want and more
Fuck off and pour another drink
And tell me what you think
You know that I'm too drunk to talk right now
You put your cigarette out on my face
So beautiful, please, woman

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't break your back for me
I'll put you out of your misery

[Chorus]
Tell me that it's all okay 
I've been waitin' on this all damn day 
Call me in the mornin', tell me how last night went
I'm here, but don't count on me to

[Verse 2]
Stay a little longer if you convince me
And tell me all the things that you have against me
Every time we make up, the truth is fadin'
Everybody's blind when the view's amazin'
Damn, who are we right now?
Can we have a little conversation?
Figure it out with no intoxication
We carry on, what is our motivation?
We're never wrong, how the hell we gonna make it?
Maybe we're used to this
Tell me, what are we to do?
It's like we only play to lose
Chasin' pain with an excuse
I love that shit and so do you

[Pre-Chorus]
But don't break your back for me
I'll put you out of your misery

[Chorus]
Tell me that it's all okay 
I've been waitin' on this all damn day 
Call me in the mornin', tell me how last night went
I'm here, but don't count on me to stay

[Guitar Solo]

[Chorus]
Tell me that it's all okay 
I've been waitin' on this all damn day 
Call me in the mornin', tell me how last night went
I'm here, but don't count on me to stay

[Verse 1]
Lighting stog after stog, I choke on the smoke
They tell me to quit, don't listen what I'm told
They help me forget that this world is so cold
I don't even know what I'm chasin' no more
Tell me what I want, just keep searchin' on
It's never enough, cup after cup
Blunt after blunt, I wouldn't give one if I could find a fuck
Ha, ha, ha, uh, in the cut and I put that on my momma
And my bitch called talkin' 'bout some drama
I swear there ain't no time for women on the come up
It's either pussy or the commas

[Chorus]
Man, I just wanna go flex
Gold on my teeth and on my neck
And I'm stone cold with the flex
With my squad and I'm smokin' up a check
Man, I just wanna go flex
Gold on my teeth and on my neck
And I'm stone cold with the flex
With my squad and I'm smokin' up a check

[Verse 2]
Uh, yeah, push the gas, get a motherfuckin' nose bleed
She ain't never met a youngin' do it like me
She got a man but she says she really like me
She doin' things to excite me
She sendin' all her friends snaps of my new tracks
'Cause all these hoes know what's about to come next
I hit my plug up, got the paper connect
I drop a couple bands I just wanna go

[Chorus]
Man, I just wanna go flex
Gold on my teeth and on my neck
And I'm stone cold with the flex
With my squad and I'm smokin' up a check
Man, I just wanna go flex
Gold on my teeth and on my neck
And I'm stone cold with the flex
With my squad and I'm smokin' up a check

[Bridge]
Knowing all of this, it just don't make a difference
I'm just talking shit to the ones that'll listen
I come with the heat man, I swear I'm never missing
And I'm still the same and I swear I'm never switching
Knowing all of this, it just don't make a difference
I'm just talking shit to the ones that'll listen
I come with the heat man, I swear I'm never missing
And I'm still the same and I swear I'm never switching

[Chorus]
Man, I just wanna go flex
Gold on my teeth and on my neck
And I'm stone cold with the flex
With my squad and I'm smokin' up a check
Man, I just wanna go flex
Gold on my teeth and on my neck
And I'm stone cold with the flex
With my squad and I'm smokin' up a check

[Outro]
Ooh, man, I just wanna go flex
Gold on my teeth and on my neck
And I'm stone cold with the flex, yeah
Ice cold with the flex
Haha, that shit hard

[Intro]
Yeah, yeah
Mmm, ayy

[Chorus]
Candy paint with the white on top
Lambo doors are the oo-op drop
If you busy plottin' on what I got
Kick in your door, that's SWAT, you thot
Hundred thousand dollars on the table top
Half price my whip, same price my watch
Got no jumper, but I ball a lot
Bitch, I'm young Stoney, I do what I want
Candy paint with the white on top 
Lambo doors are the oo-op drop 
If you busy plottin' on what I got
Kick in your door, that's SWAT, you thot 
Hundred thousand dollars on the table top
Half price my whip, same price my watch 
Got no jumper, but I ball a lot 
Bitch, I'm young Stoney, I do what I want

[Verse 1]
Didn't know that was your girl when she gave me top 
Kicked her out the Rolls said, "Thanks a lot"
Goddamn, I love paper like I'm Michael Scott 
I can do things that your man cannot 
Slide boy comin' down, damn, I'm hot 
Everybody say that I gotta be stopped 
Even though my final form ain't unlocked 
I'm so ahead of you muhfuckas'
How you comprehend what you ain't understandin'?
Count a hundred bands and I watch it vanish
Diamonds going crazy like they on the dance floor
Got a lot of ass, nothin' I can't handle

[Pre-Chorus]
Flavor lasts forever, you should try a sample 
Baby, I'm the boss like I'm Tony Danza 
Everybody tryna tell me what I stand for
But you don't fuckin' know me, homie, you don't want war 

[Chorus]
Candy paint with the white on top
Lambo doors are the oo-op drop
If you busy plottin' on what I got
Kick in your door, that's SWAT, you thot
Hundred thousand dollars on the table top
Half price my whip, same price my watch
Got no jumper, but I ball a lot 
Bitch, I'm young Stoney, I do what I want 
Candy paint with the white on top 
Lambo doors are the oo-op drop 
If you busy plottin' on what I got
Kick in your door, that's SWAT, you thot 
Hundred thousand dollars on the table top 
Half price my whip, same price my watch 
Got no jumper, but I ball a lot 
Bitch, I'm young Stoney, I do what I want

[Verse 2]
I've been rollin' twenty ash, hit the road 
Hit the switch up the suicide doors 
We already know you vanished though 
Hit my momma when I ride in that, oh
All these muhfuckas' so false with me 
If your money funny, don't talk to me 
I know there ain't shit that you could offer me 
Take a second if you think about crossin' me

[Pre-Chorus]
It lasts forever, you should try a sample 
Baby, I'm the boss like I'm Tony Danza 
Everybody tryna tell me what I stand for 
But you don't fuckin' know me, homie, you don't want war 

[Chorus]
Candy paint with the white on top
Lambo doors are the oo-op drop
If you busy plottin' on what I got
Kick in your door, that's SWAT, you thot
Hundred thousand dollars on the table top
Half price my whip, same price my watch
Got no jumper, but I ball a lot
Bitch, I'm young Stoney, I do what I want
Candy paint with the white on top
Lambo doors are the oo-op drop 
If you busy plottin' on what I got 
Kick in your door, that's SWAT, you thot
Hundred thousand dollars on the table top 
Half price my whip, same price my watch 
Got no jumper, but I ball a lot 
Bitch, I'm young Stoney, I do what I want

[Verse 1: Post Malone]
Me and Kurt feel the same, too much pleasure is pain
My girl spites me in vain, all I do is complain
She needs something to change, need to take off the e-e-edge
So fuck it all tonight
And don't tell me to shut up
When you know you talk too much
But you don't got shit to say 

[Chorus: Post Malone]
I want you out of my head
I want you out of my bedroom tonight 
There's no way I could save you 
'Cause I need to be saved too
I'm no good at goodbyes

[Verse 2: Post Malone]
We're both actin' insane, but too stubborn to change
Now I'm drinkin' again, 80 proof in my veins
And my fingertips stained, looking over the e-e-edge
Don't fuck with me tonight
Say you needed this heart, then you got it 
Turns out that it wasn't what you wanted 
And we wouldn't let go and we lost it
Now I'm a goner

[Chorus: Post Malone]
I want you out of my head 
I want you out of my bedroom tonight 
There's no way I could save you 
'Cause I need to be saved too 
I'm no good at goodbyes

[Verse 3: Young Thug]
I want you out of my life
I want you back here tonight
I'm tryna cut you, no knife
I wanna slice you and dice you
My argue possessive, it got you precise
Can you not turn off the TV? I'm watchin' the fight
I flood the garage, blue diamond, no shark
You're Barbie life doll, it's Nicki Minaj
You don't need a key to drive, your car on the charger
I just wanna see the side, the one that's unbothered 
And I don't want ya to never go outside 
I promise if they play, my niggas slidin' 
I'm fuckin' her, and the tour bus still ridin' 
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Chorus: Post Malone]
I want you out of my head 
I want you out of my bedroom tonight 
There's no way I could save you 
'Cause I need to be saved too 
I'm no good at goodbyes

[Outro: Post Malone & Young Thug]
Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye 
Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye 

Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye 
I'm no good at goodbyes
Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye 
Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye 
Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye 
I'm no good at goodbyes

[Intro: Post Malone]
Oh-oh-oh
Ooh

[Verse 1: Post Malone]
'Cause I can't take it no more
No, you ain't like them bitches
Tell them hoes adios
And you can drop your panties
Leave them shits at the door
Dior falls on the floor
I swear we been here before
I'm tryna see you from my own perspective
You all in my section tryna come to my session
We rollin' up pressure, you know that we flexin'
We bought all the bottles, we came with the models
Girl this a confession, I'm not like your exes
I came up from Texas, and now that we textin'
You can fly in whenever, now you undressin'
Panties on the dresser, your hair gettin' messed up
The feelin' we catchin', my love is a blessin'
Made love in that Lexus, made love in that Lexus
I know you remember 

[Chorus: Justin Bieber & Post Malone]
Tell me, is that dj vu? 
'Cause you want me and I want you 
Tell me, is that dj vu? 
'Cause baby it ain't nothin' new, no
Tell me, is that dj vu? 
'Cause you want me and I want you 
Tell me, is that dj vu? 
'Cause baby, this ain't nothin' new, no

[Verse 2: Justin Bieber]
Oh, you actin' reckless 
I told you that I need affection 
So let me point you in the right direction 
It's so important that you get the message 
Yeah, yeah, I gotta say, gotta say somethin' to you, you, you
I'm on a roll, I'm gonna roll out in that new, new, new
If you wanna do what I wanna do
Well uhm-uhm-uhm
Well I guess that is just dj vu

[Chorus: Justin Bieber & Post Malone]
Tell me, is that dj vu? 
'Cause you want me and I want you 
Tell me, is that dj vu? 
'Cause baby it ain't nothin' new, no
Tell me, is that dj vu? 
'Cause you want me and I want you 
Tell me, is that dj vu? 
'Cause baby, this ain't nothin' new, no

[Bridge: Justin Bieber & Post Malone]
Tell me if you want it, baby
'Cause I know I can drive you crazy
I just wanted you to know now
Oh-oh, oh-oh
Show up in that new Mercedes
You already know I'm faded
Girl, I've been thinkin' about you lately
Oh-oh, oh-oh

[Chorus: Justin Bieber & Post Malone]
Tell me, is that dj vu? 
'Cause you want me and I want you 
Tell me, is that dj vu? 
'Cause baby it ain't nothin' new, no
Tell me, is that dj vu? 
'Cause you want me and I want you 
Tell me, is that dj vu? 
'Cause baby, this ain't nothin' new, no

[Outro: Post Malone]
'Cause I can't take it no more
No, you ain't like them bitches
Tell them hoes adios
And you can drop your panties
Leave them shits at the door
Dior falls on the floor
I swear we been here before

[Intro]
Hollywood's bleeding, vampires feedin'
Darkness turns to dust
Everyone's gone, but no one's leavin'
Nobody left but us
Trynachasea feelin', butwe'll never feel it
Ridin' on thelast train home
Dyin' in our sleep, we're livin' out a dream
We only make it out alone

[Chorus]
I just keep on hopin' that you call me
You say you wanna see me, but you can't right now
You never took the time to get to know me
Was scared of losin' somethin' that we never found
We're running out of reasons, but we can't let go
Yeah, Hollywood is bleeding, but we call it home

[Verse]
Outside, the winter sky turnin' grey
City up in smoke, it's only ash when it rains
Howl at the moon and go to sleep in the day
Love for everybody 'til the drugs fade away
In the mornin', blocking out the sun with the shades
She gotta check her pulse and tell herself that she okay
It seem like dying young is an honor
But who'd be at my funeral? I wonder
I go out, and all they eyes on me
I show out, do you like what you see?
And now they closin' in on me
Let 'em sharpen all they teeth
This is more than I can handle
Blood in my Lambo'
Wish I could go, oh, I'm losin' ho-ope
I light a candle, some Palo Santo
For all these demons, wish I could just go on

[Chorus]
I just keep on hopin' that you call me
You say you wanna see me, but you can't right now
You never took the time to get to know me
Was scared of losin' somethin' that we never found
We're running out of reasons, but we can't let go
Yeah, Hollywood is bleeding, but we call it home

[Intro]
I've been looking for someone...
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh

[Verse 1]
And I've been looking for someone to put up with my bullshit
I can't even leave my bedroom so I keep pouring
And I ain't seen a light of day since, well, that's not important
It's been long
And I was feeling Whitney, me and my homies sip the Houston
Cars and clothes, thought I was winning, you knew I was losing
You told me to wake up but my clock always stays on snooze
And I'm done

[Chorus]
To each their own and find peace in knowing
Ain't always broken, but here's to hoping
Show no emotion, against your coding
Just act as hard as you can
You don't need a friend
Boy, you're the man

[Bridge]
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh

[Verse 2]
And I've been looking for someone that I can buy my drugs from
It seems like every plug ran east to Utah, became Mormons
Drought comes around, feels like I have no one to depend on
Sober, ugh
I had 80 beers on Tuesday night, I had nothing to do then
I put on a little Dwight and sang a happy tune
And lit a cigarette, stepped out the door, had an appearance
Drank more

[Chorus]
To each their own and find peace in knowing
Ain't always broken, but here's to hoping
Show no emotion, against your coding
Just act as hard as you can
You don't need a friend
Boy, you're the man

[Outro]
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh

[Verse 1]
Never know when someone comes and tries to take my life
I've been sleepin' with the .45 like every night
In the whip I pray to God I don't see flashin' lights
God damn, they right behind me
And I wake up everyday
I wake up every day with this anxiety
And they know where I stay
Got "Malone" on my plates
And they followin' me
Two hundred bands under the floor of the kitchen
A little more up in the walls and the ceilin'
Even family and friends started switchin'
Ever since I got that check, seen 'em itchin'

[Pre-Chorus]
Eyes open, I see you, I'm watchin' you
More people wanna be you, don't trust no one

[Chorus]
Tell me why I can get no relief 
Wonderin' when they'll come for me
A paranoid man makes paranoid plans
I do what I can, but it's out of my hands
Strugglin' just to find my peace

[Verse 2]
Sometimes feel like I got no friends
Can't trust a soul, like I'm Snowden
Right by the bed, keep it loaded
Lord have mercy if they broke in
I don't ever sleep, yeah, I'm wide awake
If you try to pull up to my place
Beam is gonna hit you a mile away
I promise, one of us gonna die today
Helicopters in the sky
No, he can't escape the eyes
Politicians and the lies
Tell me, what's the point in pickin' sides?

[Chorus]
Tell me why I can get no relief 
Wonderin' when they'll come for me
A paranoid man makes paranoid plans
I do what I can, but it's out of my hands
Strugglin' just to find my peace

[Bridge]
 Mind is runnin' all day
Cost me more than money and I'm payin' the price, yeah
I ain't goin' nowhere
Killin' myself so I can make me a life, yeah
Minute after minute, never had a limit
Woke up every mornin', knew that I just had to get it
Windows always tinted, you ain't lookin' in it
Either way, I know they'll come for me again

[Chorus]
Tell me why I can get no relief 
Wonderin' when they'll come for me
A paranoid man makes paranoid plans
I do what I can, but it's out of my hands
Strugglin' just to find my peace

[Intro]
Ahahah, yeah


[Verse 1]
When you leave me, make me jump up off my roof
Didn't faze you, would've given you the moon
Even after everything that we've been through
I ain't never met nobody like you
Why you always tryna tell me that it's cool?
Need to quiet 'cause you never tell the truth
Felt like ballin' was the only thing to do
Trade my woman for some diamonds and a coupe

[Pre-Chorus]
When she's comin' for my heart, it feels like Armageddon
I'ma turn the tables, promise you will not forget it
Won't apologize, don't give a fuck if you're offended
No discussion, yeah we gotta go our separate ways
Won't take me down in flames
I don't even wanna know your name
Watch how everything is gonna change, yeah, ayy

[Chorus]
I'ma pull up in a Bentley
With a fuckin' hunnid thousand in my pocket, yeah, yeah
I'ma pull in, swang my door open
Stuntin', knowin' everybody watchin', yeah, yeah
And help another bitch out the whip
And I don't give a fuck if you don't like it, yeah, yeah
Just to show you that it's over
It don't matter what you gotta say about it, yeah
I'ma put that bitch pussy in a motherfuckin' bodybag
So you know that I'm never ever coming back
You kept your heart on the counter in a Prada bag
I used to never ever want to see the light of day, yeah
I was an idiot
Beggin' on my knees onto the floor
Now, I don't even want you anymore, anymore
It's over now
It's over now, yeah, yeah, yeah, ayy

[Verse 2]
Feels like a knife in my throat, you treat this like it's a joke
I bet you've done this before, I ain't surprised, yeah
I wasn't tryna let go, but you'll know why when I'm ghost
I hope you wind up alone, dead in my eyes, yeah
Ain't religious, only Christian when it's Dior
Only prayin' for the Amex and the gold
You ain't stop me, no, you only was a detour
Tried to drive me crazy, you ran out of road

[Pre-Chorus]
When she's comin' for my heart, it feels like Armageddon
I'ma turn the tables, promise you will not forget it
Won't apologize, don't give a fuck if you're offended
No discussion, yeah we gotta go our separate ways
Won't take me down in flames
I don't even wanna know your name
Watch how everything is gonna change , yeah, ayy

[Chorus]
I'ma pull up in a Bentley
With a fuckin' hunnid thousand in my pocket, yeah, yeah
I'ma pull in, swang my door open
Stuntin', knowin' everybody watchin', yeah, yeah
And help another bitch out the whip
And I don't give a fuck if you don't like it, yeah, yeah 
Just to show you that it's over
It don't matter what you gotta say about it, yeah 
I'ma put that bitch pussy in a motherfuckin' bodybag 
So you know that I'm never ever coming back 
You kept your heart on the counter in a Prada bag 
I used to never ever want to see the light of day, yeah
I was an idiot
Beggin' on my knees on to the floor 
Now I don't even want you anymore, anymore
It's over now
It's over now

Why don't you take what you want from me?
Take what you need from me

[Verse 1: Post Malone]
I never needed anything from you
And all I ever asked was for the truth 
You showed your tongue and it was forked in two
Your venom was lethal, I almost believed you 
Yeah, you preyed on my every mistake
Waited on me to break, held me under hopin' I would drown
Like a plague, I was wasting away
Tryna find my way out, find my way out 

[Pre-Chorus 1: Post Malone]
And it finally came the day
I start giving my heart away
For Heaven's sake, my bones will break
But you'll never own my soul, no

[Chorus: Post Malone]
I feel you crumble in my arms down to your heart of stone
You bled me dry just like the tears you never show
Why don't you take what you want from me?
Take what you need from me
Take what you want and go
Why don't you take what you want from me?
Take what you need from me
Take what you want and go

[Verse 2: Travis Scott]
I took them stones you threw, made chains for the crew 
I brought up 10 hoes, this coupe only made for two 
They all ran through it, it ain't nothin' left to do
I need some more reasons to live out this evening 
I've been sippin' forever and just taking whatever
Hoping, thinking whenever you'll be back around
Let's go our ways, whichever
You say how is however long
'Cause you know I'll never be alone 

[Pre-Chorus 2: Travis Scott]
Love 
Shorty gon' back 
Need it on sight 
Crack it all back 
Give her that pipe 
All of my gang 
Shawty went bad 

[Chorus: Ozzy Osbourne & Post Malone]
I feel you crumble in my arms down to your heart of stone
You bled me dry just like the tears you never show
Why don't you take what you want from me?

Take what you want and go
Why don't you take what you want from me?
Take what you need from me
Take what you want and go

[Pre-Chorus]
All this stuntin' couldn't satisfy my soul 
Got a hundred big places, but I'm still alone 

[Chorus]
Ayy, I would throw it all away
I just keep on wishin' that the money made you stay
You ain't never cared about that bullshit anyway
I just keep on wishin' that the money made you stay, ayy
You know I would throw it all away
I just keep on wishin' that the money made you stay
Price went up, my price went up, we went our separate ways
I just keep on wishin' that the money made you stay, ayy, ayy

[Verse 2]
Buy me love, tried to buy me love
Now I'm alone, Ice Box, Omarion 
Plenty sluts grabbin' on my nuts 
Might have fucked, it was only lust 
I was livin' life, how could I have known? 
Couldn't listen to advice 'cause I'm never wrong 
In the spotlight, but I'm on my own 
Now that you're gone 

[Pre-Chorus]
All this stuntin' couldn't satisfy my soul 
Got a hundred big places, but I'm still alone 

[Chorus]
Ayy, I would throw it all away
I just keep on wishin' that the money made you stay
You ain't never cared about that bullshit anyway
I just keep on wishin' that the money made you stay, ayy
You know I would throw it all away
I just keep on wishin' that the money made you stay
Price went up, my price went up, we went our separate ways
I just keep on wishin' that the money made you stay, ayy, ayy

[Intro: Future & Post Malone]
Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah
Yeah, you'd die for me
Said you'd die, said you'd die
Butyoulied, you liedto me

[Chorus: Post Malone]
Said you'd take a bullet,told me you would die for me
I had a really bad feeling you'd been lying to me
We were on the low, but you were getting high with me
When it's past 11, that's a different side I see
Said you'd die for me, you'd die for me, you'd die for me
But you lied to me, you lied to me, you lied to me
Said you'd die for me, you'd die for me, you'd die for me
But you lied to me, you lied to me, you lied to me

[Verse 1: Post Malone]
It was love at first sight, felt like you were chosen 
But that blood in your veins, yeah, I know it's frozen 
Got no patience no more , been waitin' too long 
You hid that shit away and I was the last one to know, bitch 
I heard you comin' in, I was lyin' there awake 
Didn't know that it was you, got the gun right out the safe 
Remember when you got my ass arrested 
At least when I was in jail, I got some rest in 

[Pre-Chorus: Post Malone]
Ooh, I surrender , time to forget ya 
I'm too tired to forgive ya , it's too hard on my liver 
And you know  its all  over now
All your friends , you know  they sold you out

[Chorus: Post Malone & Future]
Said you'd take a bullet, told me you would die for me 
I had a really bad feeling you'd been lying to me 
We were on the low, but you were getting high with me 
When it's past 11, that's a different side I see 
Said you'd die for me, you'd die for me, you'd die for me 
But you lied to me, you lied to me, you lied to me 
Said you'd die for me, you'd die for me, you'd die for me 
But you lied to me, you lied to me, you lied to me, yeah 

[Verse 2: Future]
It was a VIP, happened to be one of my best nights 
9 AM, I came from out the club, it was daylight 
Got a bad girl, I was treating her too nice
Caught you being vulnerable, that ain't what I need 
You just sold your soul, girl, quit crying 
Your passport, it looks like you lying 
You broken down by your past, don't deny it 
Your ex called, you was vulnerable, you flying, nah 
Wasn't on the best of terms, girl, I was trying 
I did everything to reach out to you 
Said you never had me caught up in nodrama 
I done ran into my karma 

[Chorus: Future]
Said you'd take a bullet, told me you would die for me 
I had a really bad feeling you'd been lying to me 
We been on the low, but you been getting high with me 
When it's past 11, that's a different side I see 
Said you'd die for me, you'd die for me, you'd die for me 
But you lied to me, you lied to me, you lied to me 
Said you'd die for me, you'd die for me, you'd die for me 
But you lied to me, you lied to me, you lied to me

[Verse 3: Halsey]
Settle down, I'll spell it out, it's simple enough
I came around, I figured out, should follow my gut
I don't play anymore, I went through your phone
And called the girls in your DMs and took all them home
And I know it's been a while since the last time you heard from me
Grew into a savage and that's why they gave this verse to me
Turns out it shows 'cause they turn out at shows
I sold 15 million copies of a break-up note
Brought some strangers in our beds
And now you lost your right to privacy
Spilling all our secrets
When you thought they'd probably die with me
Know you fucking love it on the low
And you don't have to say I'm crazy
'Cause I know nothing's changed though

[Chorus: Post Malone & Halsey, Halsey]
Said you'd take a bullet, told me you would die for me

I had a really bad feeling you'd been lying to me

We were on the low, but you were getting high with me

When it's past 11, that's a different side I see

Said you'd die for me, you'd die for me, you'd die for me

But you lied to me, you lied to me, you lied to me

Said you'd die for me, you'd die for me, you'd die for me

But you lied to me, you lied to me, you lied to me

Ooh-ooh, wow

[Verse 1]
Hunnid and twenty, come catch me
Forties inside of my belly
Shouldn't be drivin', I'm faded 
Rock that Nirvana, my favorite
Damn, I forgot what her name is
She in the front seat, head-bangin' 
Yeah, money counter sound somethin' like a chopper, chopper 
Speaker system bumpin', fuck your fuckin' block up 
Used to mock him, now it's custom Bentley mock-ups 
Killer drop, a call from lockup
If you buy that Echo, why you lyin'? You broke
Got a nine in my tote, get you smoked like a stoge
Keep on ridin' my coat, your new shit is a joke
Why you bitin' my flows? What you tryna be, Post?
Yeah

[Chorus]
Ooh, baby, ooh, baby, guap keep expandin'
Ooh, yuck me up, I don't want no romancin'
Ooh, baby, I see these muhfuckas' glancin'
When my whip stop, then my wheels keep spinnin' 
Ooh, baby, ooh, baby, guap keep expandin'
Ooh, yuck me up, I don't want no romancin'
Ooh, baby, I see these muhfuckas' glancin'
When my whip stop, then my wheels keep spinnin'

[Verse 2]

She used to shoppin' at the mall 
I'll teach lil baby how to ball
I hit Rodeo, spent like 40 G's 
Four hunnid pairs of Gucci socks 
I lost all my friends, made a lot of foes
Made a lot of M's, made a lot of moves
Open up the safe , I'm just with the bros
Cop the 458, cost me 250 
Man, look at all my ice 
I hit your main thing twice 
Take a word of advice 
Break up with that ho 

[Chorus]
Ooh, baby, ooh, baby, guap keep expandin'
Ooh, yuck me up, I don't want no romancin' 
Ooh, baby, I see these muhfuckas' glancin' 
When my whip stop, then my wheels keep spinnin' 
Ooh, baby, ooh, baby, guap keep expandin' 
Ooh, yuck me up, I don't want no romancin' 
Ooh, baby, I see these muhfuckas' glancin'
When my whip stop, then my wheels keep spinnin'

[Bridge]
Cold wrist frozen
Got sacks, Goldman
Bought the bar, Roseanne
No joke, deadpan

[Chorus]
Ooh, baby, ooh, baby, guap keep expandin'
Ooh, yuck me up, I don't want no romancin'
Ooh, baby, I see these muhfuckas glancin'
When my whip stop, then my wheels keep spinnin' 
Ooh, baby, ooh, baby, guap keep expandin' 
Ooh, yuck me up, I don't want no romancin' 
Ooh, baby, I see these muhfuckas glancin' 
When my whip stop, then my wheels keep spinnin'

Yo, gotta hit him on the jack
When you comin' back? Where is you at on the map?
Everything is intact
Coulda been a seamstress, still wouldn't cut him slack
Pretty much, ain't got a clue
Itty bitty piggyback off everything I do
But I'm still droppin' jaws
Got 'em lookin' like James Harden at the awards 
Back to you, I'm so into you
For real, breh like I'm kin to you
If you a 10, I add 10 to you
They be mad when I tend to you
That's what the bae like
Call me Buffy 'cause that's what I slay like
These bitches, I son 'em like it's daylight
These niggas wanna know what it tastes like 
What it tastes like, yo, what it tastes like, yo
They wanna know what it tastes like, yo
All this ice, it should taste like snow
Get kimonos and let's fly to Tokyo
Pretty, pretty please baby, won't you cop this for me? Uh

[Pre-Chorus: Post Malone]
Baby, could you? I got too much on my mind right now 
I ain't got the time to get you Saint Laurent now
Could you? I got too much on my mind right now

[Chorus: Post Malone & Swae Lee]
I don't have much to say, I'll be out front
Won't you come spoil my night?
Feelin's come into play and I'm thinkin' this happens every time
Spoil my night, spoil my night
Spoil my night 
Spoil my night, spoil my night

[Verse 1: Swae Lee]
My necklace has a natural glow
She dancin' in the strobe
Let's fuckin' spoil my night 
Spent so much cash, I lost her
My cup was too toxic
I took the robe off 
I couldn't get her off me
Dropped plenty money on her thighs
There's plenty room in my ride
I've never been like a small fry
She took me in, that's on my life

[Chorus: Swae Lee & Post Malone]
Spoil my night, spoil my night
Spoil my night 
Spoil my night, spoil my night
I don't have much to say, I'll be out front
Won't you come spoil my night? 
Feelin's come into play and I'm thinkin' this happens every time

[Verse 2: Post Malone]
Yeah, when I walk up in a party, they all act like they know me
Then I spotted lil' mama through the wall of jabronis 
Point her out so I can bag her if they just bring her to me 
I ain't even see the face, but she got beautiful boobies 
And she see those diamonds in my teeth 
I see her smilin' back at me 
I think she rock with me like Jumanji 
It's about time, Postmate Plan B
Now she whippin' out her phone and I know 
Damn, how many videos you gon' post?
Everybody on the 'Gram gonna know
My girl at home now my line about to blow 
I know what I'm doin' ain't right
But ain't no need to spoil my night, no need, no need

[Chorus: Swae Lee & Post Malone]
Spoil my night, spoil my night
Spoil my night 
Spoil my night, spoil my night
I don't have much to say, I'll be out front
Won't you come spoil my night? 
Feelin's come into play and I'm thinkin' this happens every time 

[Outro: Swae Lee]
Spoil my night, spoil my night
Spoil my night, spoil my night
Spoil my night, spoil my night

I cross my t's and dot my i's yeah I'm for real 
He hold me down 
That's my shield 
He buy whatever, he know the drill 
Don't need no pill 
He whispered in my ear and told me feel, feel, feel, oh, oh, oh 

[Verse 2: Kehlani]
He love that I say what I feel
He feel what I say 'cause it's real
You couldn't forget, I never changed up on my set
And I only make calls to collect, that's why we connect
We can go half on a jet, baby, we on to the next
Fuck all the stress
Fuckin' with bitches who's new to the game when you got you a vet
I know you like it when I act like I'm still shy
Then turn around and put that thing in overdrive
I'm down to ride
I'ma keep you on my shoulder
'Cause every cold nigga need a bitch that's ten times colder

[Chorus: Kehlani & Post Malone]
I cross my t's and dot my i's yeah I'm for real

Such along time

Such a long time 

[Verse 1]
Ooh, this shit bliss, I'm so rich 
Abs like Abercrombie Fitch 
Mille, on my 
Versace boxers on my dick 
Bud Light runnin' through my piss 
On a yacht, 50 meters, it's offish 
50 carats on my fist 
The roof go down when I hit switch 
I money ball like Bradley Pitt 
I worked so hard for all this shit 
Pumpin' out classics 
In the Batmobile, goin' bat shit

[Chorus]
Such a long time 
I've been waitin', I've been waitin' for a long time 
Such a long time 
I've been waitin', I've been waitin' for a long time 
Such a long time

[Verse 2]
I'm in Saint-Tropez, I had to check wrist 
I just bought my girl a new necklace 
One, two, three, four, five, six 
I'll take 'em all, don't matter what the price is 
I said I'm sorry mama for my vices 
You'll never understand what my life is 
One, two, three, four, five, six 
Shit, I'm checking off my bucket list 
You try to give advice, I don't need it
I've been doin' what I want since fetus
What you call a holiday , I call another day 
And I ain't ever stoppin', no apologies

[Chorus]
Such a long time 
I've been waitin', I've been waitin' for a long time 
Such a long time 
I've been waitin', I've been waitin' for a long time 
Such a long time

[Outro]
I'm in Saint-Tropez, I had to check wrist

[Chorus]
Man, my life so sweet, I feel like Cody 
I wake up, rinse my mouth with fuckin' codeine 
Thirty bottles, yeah, the bill is on me 
Been livin' fast, no, I can't take it slowly 
Man, my life so sweet, I feel like Cody 
I wake up, rinse my mouth with fuckin' codeine 
We on a bender, we ain't gettin' no sleep 
We turned the hotel lobby to a party

[Verse 1]
I'm whippin' a foreign, I can't whip no Beetle 
I rock that Saint Laurent over my beater 
I like to stunt like I'm Evel Knievel 
But, it don't mean nothin' without all my people 
When I step up on stage, hands up to the sky 
Every little thing I do, they always analyze 
Gave that bitch a little blow and then she come alive 
Started dancin' on the table, like she had on mine 

[Pre-Chorus]
I don't fuck with nobody , yeah, you hardly know me 
What you take me for , no, I can't save your soul 
I don't fuck with nobody, yeah, you hardly know me 
Please just leave me alone 

[Chorus]
Man, my life so sweet, I feel like Cody 
I wake up, rinse my mouth with fuckin' codeine 
Thirty bottles, yeah, the bill is on me 
Been livin' fast, no, I can't take it slowly 
Man, my life so sweet, I feel like Cody 
I wake up, rinse my mouth with fuckin' codeine 
We on a bender, we ain't gettin' no sleep 
We turned the hotel lobby to a party

[Verse 2]
Made a hundred bands, saw all your hands out 
No, my friend, can't do no handouts 
All these rappers, all sound the same now 
Sayin' I'm to blame, now y'all see me on the TV 
Multimillionaire by the time I'm 23 
Gettin' no sleep , ragin' for a week 
I hit number one and I ain't even hit my peak 
I just had to tell 'em

[Pre-Chorus]
I don't fuck with nobody, yeah, you hardly know me
What you take me for, no, I can't save your soul
I don't fuck with nobody, yeah, you hardly know me 
Please just leave me alone 

[Chorus]
Man, my life so sweet, I feel like Cody 
I wake up, rinse my mouth with fuckin' codeine 
Thirty bottles, yeah, the bill is on me 
Been livin' fast, no, I can't take it slowly 
Man, my life so sweet, I feel like Cody 
I wake up, rinse my mouth with fuckin' codeine 
We on a bender, we ain't gettin' no sleep 
We turned the hotel lobby to a party

[Outro]
We ain't sleepin', we ain't sleepin', we ain't 
We ain't sleepin', we ain't sleepin' tonight 
We ain't sleepin', we ain't sleepin', no way 
Pour that drink, 'cause we ain't sleepin' tonight 

[Chorus 1]
I been waitin', wide awake for the waves to come and take
Take me right to you
One hundred bottles of the good shit couldn't even bring you back
What am I to do?
Feel like I'm circlin' a drain, all I see is the remains of an ugly truth 
One hundred models I could follow all the way to hell and back, but they can't replace you 

[Bridge]
Oh, oh, oh, ohh
Oh, oh, oh, ohh
Oh, oh, oh, ohh, ohh
Oh, oh, oh, ohh
Oh, oh, oh, ohh
Oh, oh, oh, ohh, ohh

[Verse 1]
I was puttin' on for you like a jersey
What I didn't know then couldn't hurt me
Never thought that you'd go and do me dirty
Left me in the cold, but on the inside I was burnin'
But that's just the way it goes
Wish that I could have control
Everybody dies alone


[Refrain]
Say my prayers, but I lost faith a long time ago 
Dream nightmares
I guess we're gettin' used to losin' hope 
I don't even wonder why you don't answer when I call your name
Are you on the other side? Will you save us?
Or will you run away?

[Chorus 2]
I'm still waitin', wide awake for the waves to come and take
Take me right to you 
One hundred vials of denial, I know they won't bring you back
What am I to do? 
Youre my alibi and motive when I'm lyin' to myself, what an ugly truth 
Were no strangers to the flame
We will never be the same if we make it through 

[Verse 2]
My back is up against the wall
But I used to feel invincible
Yeah, it was us against the world
But somehow, someway, the tables turned
I remember back then
Played my cards right you were my best hand
Still you keep me guessin'
Wonder if I'll ever get the message

[Refrain]
Say my prayers, but I lost faith a long time ago 
Dream nightmares
I guess we're gettin' used to losin' hope 
I don't even wonder why you don't answer when I call your name
Are you on the other side? Will you save us?
Or will you run away?

[Outro]
Are you on the other side? Will you save us?
Or will you run away?

Million followers, but your bumpers broken

I know you only like me
'Cause I just spent a hundred bands in one night
Spent a hundred bands in one night

Clothes all new, not a wrinkle

Bottles on deck and my drink full

Yeah, the beat knockin', yeah, this shit clap
Welcome to the west it's where people gettin' rich at, ayy

[Intro]
Oh-oh-oh-oh

[Verse 1]
She said, "Love me" so I love her 
She said, "Leave me" so I left 
Then I went to California 
And I ain't never comin' back
I got a high five from a brother 
I got bloodstains on the bed 
And I ain't sayin' that I love her 
But this bitch is gonna drive me mad
I said this bitch is gonna drive me mad 

[Chorus]
You got just what I been looking for
But you can't bring yourself to say no
And I ain't never gonna let you go
I kept wishing I would die, oh
The whole plane ride home
And I wish I could
I know I should leave you alone



[Verse 2]
I worship since I met you 
I fell down to my knees 
And when no one would accept ya 
Throw myself up on a cross and bleed
I seen a dark cloud coming over 
I seen some evil shit in her head 
But she rode me like no other 
But this bitch is gonna drive me mad
I said this bitch is gonna drive me mad 

[Chorus]
You got just what I been looking for
But you can't bring yourself to say no
And I ain't never gonna let you go
I kept wishing I would die, oh
The whole plane ride home
And I wish I could
I know I should leave you alone




You got just what I been looking for
But you can't bring yourself to say no
And I ain't never gonna let you go
I kept wishing I would die, oh
The whole plane ride home
And I wish I could
I know I should leave you alone



[Intro]
Yeah, oh, whoa, ooh
Yeah, yeah

[Verse 1]
Said you needed a ride, but you wanted my car
Without thatface,girl, you wouldn'tget far
I really like you, despitewho you are, oh 
You see me on TV, you know I'm a star
You say you don't know me, but I know that's false
I'll pay the price, girl, whatever that cost, oh 

[Pre-Chorus]
You make my life so hard
But that's what gets me off

[Chorus]
I had a thousand bad times
So what's another time to me? 
You try to burn my house down
But what's another house to me? 
'Cause I can take anything that you give me 
It's gonna take a lot more to kill me, bitch
So thank you for the grave 
I needed me a place to sleep 

[Verse 2]
And I don't wanna meet your mama 
She prolly crazier than you 
I'm gonna need some thicker armor 
To spend another night with you 
Baby, I know just what to do
Every time you fuck me over, I'll come back to you
Baby, I don't want to know the truth 
I ignore them when they tell me all the shit you do 
I always get my heart broke like I needed the practice 
Foot on my throat 'til my world is collapsin' 
But this what I chose, it's the law of attraction, yeah 


[Pre-Chorus]
Girl, you make my life so hard 
But that's what gets me off

[Chorus]
I had a thousand bad times
So what's another time to me? 
You try to burn my house down
But what's another house to me? 
'Cause I can take anything that you give me 
It's gonna take a lot more to kill me, bitch 
So thank you for the grave 
I needed me a place to sleep 

[Bridge]
I should get out, but I still want more
I should get out, what am I waitin' for?
It's all the same to me, it's all a game to me
It's all the same to me, it's all the same

[Chorus]
I had a thousand bad times
So what's another time to me? 
You try to burn my house down
But what's another house to me? 
'Cause I can take anything that you give me 
It's gonna take a lot more to kill me, bitch 
So thank you for the grave 
I needed me a place to sleep 
We go there, oh

[Chorus]
I started with an eighth, alright 
And then I went and changed my life 
I might take out the Wraith tonight 
Put your arms around me, baby
I just want to fly, make it last before we die
And I know you want a ride
What's on your mind? What's on your mind?

[Verse 1]
And my '92 got doors like my Lambo
Spend my last paycheck on some ammo
We don't follow trends, rest in peace to Yamo
Your new shit sucks, I feel like Anthony Fantano 
Sayin' I was broke last year, I can't go back there
Nicotine fiend, couldn't even buy a pack, yeah
She don't know my music, told her I ain't mad, yeah
Let her cut that coco on my platinum plaque, yeah 
Cut my fingers on my bands, oh yeah
Cut my locker with some Xan, oh yeah
Count me my guala in advance, oh yeah
Backstreet diamonds, watch them dance on ya, yeah

[Chorus]
I started with an eighth, alright 
And then I went and changed my life 
I might take out the Wraith tonight 
Put your arms around me, baby
I just want to fly, make it last before we die
And I know you want a ride
What's on your mind? What's on your mind?

[Verse 2]
She don't want to spend all my dough
She gets paid to be a model 
I take the lead, they just follow
Face it, you don't know what I know
Pull up, I got some' for ya
Somethin' in my trunk for ya
But I got a good lawyer
They always try to come for ya

[Pre-Chorus]
I'ma pull up in that Bentley with the fuckin' windows tinted 
'Pendin' how I'm feelin', take a drop of the extended 
Think I'm showin' signs of slowin', homie, just forget it
I guess this what happens when you fuckin' handle business, yeah

[Chorus]
I started with an eighth, alright 
And then I went and changed my life 
I might take out the Wraith tonight 
Put your arms around me, baby
I just want to fly, make it last before we die
And I know you want a ride
What's on your mind? What's on your mind?

[Bridge]
I was broke last year, I can't go back there
I was broke last year, I can't go back there
Gasoline and I went and lit a match, yeah
Try to take the swagger, I know it for a fact, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
Pull up in that Bentley with the fuckin' windows tinted 
'Pendin' how I'm feelin', take a drop of the extended 
Think I'm showin' signs of slowin', homie, just forget it
I guess this what happens when you fuckin' handle business, yeah

[Chorus]
I started with an eighth, alright 
And then I went and changed my life 
I might take out the Wraith tonight 
Put your arms around me, baby
I just want to fly, make it last before we die
And I know you want a ride
What's on your mind? What's on your mind?

[Outro]
I wanna fly, I wanna fly, yeah

I wanna fly, I wanna fly, yeah

[Intro]
Yeah, yeah, yeah

[Chorus]
Yeah, I know my wrist be dancin' crazy 
Been on some fly shit lately 
Used to be so damn patient 
But now it's "Fuck you, pay me" 
Can't let these motherfuckers phase me 
Never let that money change me 
Ain't the way my momma raised me 
Don't mean to brag, but can you blame me? 

[Verse 1]
Two hundred K and VVS, yellow diamonds 
They wanna run up but they won't never find me 
Sleep right next to the F&N
Motherfuckers the government
Shut down all the plotting 
One hundred bands on my body 
Yeah, fuck with them boys, touch your body 
Lil' momma just want my pockets 
Yeah, 'Rari take off like a rocket 
Yeah, hold up, you too close 
I don't know, I don't know ya 
Had to run it, run it up 
How I roll, how I roll, yeah 
It's like after you pop off 
They all act like they know ya 
And Young Post be like Pablo 
And they all love to blow, yeah 

[Chorus]
I know my wrist be dancin' crazy 
Been on some fly shit lately 
Used to be so damn patient 
But now it's "Fuck you, pay me" 
Can't let these motherfuckers phase me 
Never let that money change me
Ain't the way my momma raised me 
Don't mean to brag, but can you blame me? 

[Verse 2]
Two hundred, swerving, dippin', dodge on the highway 
You may contain me but you won't never stop me 
On her way to my residence 
Try message your boo again
She pullin' up prolly 
Yeah, strally inside of that Bentley 
Yeah, come take a tat' on my belly 
Yeah, people actin' too friendly, man
They tryna get dividends 
This shit is a problem 
Yeah, you just be talkin' shit but ain't ever met me 
DeChino fucked your bitch and now you resent me 
I know them people but they don't represent me 
Them wastemen, we gonna make 'em all pay 
They will never stop the plan
Eighty jumpin' off my hand
Rollie, Rollie, Rollie 
Bust it open , holy moly 

[Chorus]
I know my wrist be dancin' crazy 
Been on some fly shit lately 
Used to be so damn patient 
But now it's "Fuck you, pay me" 
Can't let these motherfuckers phase me 
Never let that money change me
Ain't the way my momma raised me 
Don't mean to brag, but can you blame me? 

[Outro]
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, whoa
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, whoa
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, whoa
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Mmm, yeah
Mmm, yeah

[Verse 1]
I used to say I was free
Now all these people wanna keep on takin' pieces of me
They take away everything, had everything that I needed
They held me down, let me drown
They spit me out, right through the teeth
I can't pretend, ash in the wind, won't blow again
It was a breeze for you 
These hurricanes inside of my brain, let it rain, made it look easy Can't look away, you love the pain, you love the pain

[Pre-Chorus]
Watchin' me bleed
You cut me down on my knees
No matter what you believe
I think we both can agree

[Chorus]
That you can't blame it on me 
It's not my fault, it's not my fault, it's not my fault
Blame it on me 
It's not my fault, it's not my fault, it's not my fault
I couldn't breathe
Almost lost myself, couldn't stop myself, I did it all
You can't blame it on me 
It's not my fault, it's not my fault, it's not my fault

[Verse 2]
Every day's the same, yeah, I just watch 'em go
As I scrape away through the impossible
Yeah, I played the game but it was all for show
Tryna find my way, I nearly lost it though
Now I see dead people, most have no faith
Where did the time go? A watch with no face
They hit the ceilin', but my roof likes space
I took my chances so won't you

[Chorus]
Blame it on me 
It's not my fault, it's not my fault, it's not my fault
Blame it on me 
It's not my fault, it's not my fault, it's not my fault
I couldn't breathe
Almost lost myself, couldn't stop myself, I did it all
You can't blame it on me 
It's not my fault, it's not my fault, it's not my fault, not my fault

[Bridge]
It's all my fault that I'm addicted to the clothes
It's all my fault, I paid the cost, yeah
It's all my fault that I ain't givin' up my soul
It's all my fault

[Pre-Chorus]
Watchin' me bleed 
You cut me down on my knees 
No matter what you believe
I think we both can agree

[Chorus]
That you can't blame it on me 
It's not my fault, it's not my fault, it's not my fault
Blame it on me 
It's not my fault, it's not my fault, it's not my fault
I couldn't breathe
Almost lost myself, couldn't stop myself, I did it all
You can't blame it on me 
It's not my fault, it's not my fault, it's not my fault

[Outro]
It's not my fault, it's not my fault, it's not my fault
Blame it on me, yeah
It's not my fault, it's not my fault, it's not my fault

[Chorus]
Drinkin' all night, but we ain't done yet 
Waitin' on the plug, but he ain't come yet 
Still need somethin'? Put your bank on it 
Got a big bag with a Bape on it 
Party ain't over if they say somethin' 
No sleep 'til I've seen three suns 
Party gon' end with a threesome 
Raw dog, prolly have three sons

They go to work for some money, we make it from actin' out 
Grrrrrah, we takin' shots right now 
Grrrrrah, yeah, we takin' shots right now 

[Verse 1]
See me in a 'Rari goin' vroom-vroom 
Sexy motherfucker in a cartoon
Saint Laurent, 40, on a new suit
Sippin' Bud Light, that's a new cruise
Baby, bust it open like woo-hoo
The diamonds got cut like a boo-boo
Pockets so fat, rock a muu-muu
Me and Dre came for the pum pum
Drippin', drippin', drippin', women tryna take my millions
Help my bro with an assist I'm Jason Williams 
Heard that there's a party, I might pay a visit 
That's a moment, hopped out frog like ribbit, ribbit 

[Pre-Chorus]
Drunk when I walked in the door, so fuckin' high like, "Hello"
I told her pour me some more, then she went right for the blow 
30 more girls wanna roll, let's get this bitch on the road 
Already losin' control, this is the life that we chose

[Chorus]
Drinkin' all night, but we ain't done yet 
Waitin' on the plug, but he ain't come yet 
Still need somethin'? Put your bank on it

[Verse 2]
Frontin' on me, but you love it 
Tryna act like you above it 
Dad bod know you wanna rub it 
Have you ever done it in public?
Sippin' all night, let it rotate
Baby, just for the night, you my soulmate
Mixin' vodka with the champagne
Tell me how much liquor can a man take
How many records have I sold?
I don't even know, can't keep count 
You know that I've been on a roll
Celebratin' life when I come around 
Sippin' all night, sippin' all day
Brought the beerbong out like a tailgate
Holdin' big words that I can't say
Got me speakin' drunkanese, can you translate?

[Pre-Chorus]
Drunk when I walked in the door, so fuckin' high like, "Hello"
I told her pour me some more, then she went right for the blow 
30 more girls wanna roll, let's get this bitch on the road 
Already losin' control, this is the life that we chose

[Chorus: Post Malone]
Used to have friends, now I got enemies 
Used to keep 'em close, now theydeadto me 
Usedto have friends, now I gotenemies 
Enemies, yeah, it's so sad

[Verse 1: Post Malone]
They said I would never get this far, ah, ah
Think that we don't see who you are, are, are?
Laughin' to the bank like ha, ha, ha
Guess that I'm just talkin' too much blah, blah, blah 
So, where did y'all go? 
When I was shit broke, couldn't even buy smokes
Now your mama needs tickets to my stadium show 
She love it when she hear me on the radio, oh
I know it's hard to swallow your pride
Sorry that you can't get over me 
Now you're out my life, I'm so relieved, I

[Chorus: Post Malone]
Used to have friends, now I got enemies 
Used to keep 'em close, now they dead to me 
Money tend to show all they tendencies 
Enemies, yeah, it's so sad

[Post-Chorus: Post Malone]
Sometimes, every time, they let me down 
Sometimes, every time, they let me down 
Used to have friends, now I got enemies
Enemies, yeah, it's so sad

[Verse 2: DaBaby]
Close to my enemies 
I need better energy 
When I told you fuck you, you thought I was playin', huh?
 But I meant the shit literally
She want to vibe but I told her fuck that 
She looking at me like she surprised
They're packin' the post and I'm home alone
When the box hit the door, they go for 35
I try to put on for my partners, they turn into enemies right before a nigga eye
You reach for a shake, I'ma hold out a fist
Giving a nigga a quarter pound without the fries
I just went double platinum with no features
Just to show a nigga I don't really need him
Pass a man a plate and he can make it shake
It's guaranteed he'll fold and bite the hand that feed him
And I know you think that I ain't see it
And I know you bitch ain't got a car
Don't make me go and buy a bitch a lil' Prius
Fuck on the camera, we can call it even
Friends are like the autumn, every year they leavin'
And I'ma rake 'em in a pile, throw 'em in a bag
Tie them bitches up and leave 'em
'Cause most of these niggas are deceiving
And I 

[Chorus: Post Malone]
Used to have friends, now I got enemies 
Used to keep 'em close, now they dead to me 
Money tend to show all they tendencies 
Enemies, yeah, it's so sad

[Post-Chorus: Post Malone]
Sometimes, every time, they let me down 
Sometimes, every time, they let me down 
Used to have friends, now I got enemies
Enemies, yeah, it's so sad

[Bridge: Post Malone]
It's too late to turn this shit around 
Only held me down when you wanted me to drown
It's too late to turn this shit around 
So don't try and tell me that you're happy for me now

[Chorus: Post Malone]
Used to have friends, now I got enemies
Used to keep 'em close, now they dead to me 
Money tend to show all they tendencies 
Enemies, yeah, it's so sad

[Post-Chorus: Post Malone]
Sometimes, every time, they let me down 
Sometimes, every time, they let me down 
Used to have friends, now I got enemies
Enemies, yeah, it's so sad

[Outro: Post Malone]
Ooh, it's too late
It's too late

[Intro: Post Malone]
Mm, mm, mm
Mm

[Chorus: Post Malone]
'Cause they aint ever seein' me fold under pressure
They ain't never, ever seenmefold, nah, never
Alwayskeep one up on em 'causeI'm too clever
I would never, ever sell my soul, nah, never
'Cause I been on the road, been on the road, I
Quit actin' like you been with me this whole time
'Cause I been on the road, been on the road, I
Quit actin' like you been with me this whole time

[Verse 1: Post Malone]
Yeah, they bet I'ma fall
And Im only 24, but, bitch, I been through it all
I got so many hits, cant remember them all 
While I'm takin a shit, look at the plaques on the wall
Y'all just sit back, get your kick back
Keep on actin' like you did that, got no respect
For nobody who's just fake in life, ayy, ayy
You aint really who you say you are
So pick up the pace, there ain't no slowin' me up 
Get the fuck out my face, can you stop blowing me up?
'Cause my time is expensive, one mill a setlist
Bought a new car 'fore you woke up for breakfast, yeah

[Chorus: Post Malone]
'Cause they ain't ever seen me fold under pressure
They ain't never, ever seen me fold, nah, never
Always keep one up on 'em 'cause I'm too clever 
I would never, ever sell my soul, nah, never
'Cause I been on the road, been on the road, I
Quit actin' like you been with me this whole time
'Cause I been on the road, been on the road, I
Quit actin' like you been with me this whole time

[Verse 2: Meek Mill]
Yeah, where you been? 
When it was time to do some work and put it in 
I just be laughin' when I see 'em, look at them 
Leave when I lose and pop back up as soon as I win 
You ain't my day one and I know you not my friend
So I can't judge you when you do some phony shit and just pretend
Like you really down with me, because bein' loyal starts within
I seen that money overpower that love and turn it thin
But it ain't stop me, I just kept goin' up, took it on the chin
I wish every time they said I would fold, I'd make an M
Fuck around and be as rich as Jeff Bezos, say it again
Never lose, I go overtime on 'em, stay in that gym
Let's get it

[Chorus: Post Malone]
'Cause they ain't ever seein' me fold under pressure
They ain't never, ever seen me fold, nah, never
Always keep one up on 'em 'cause I'm too clever
I would never, ever sell my soul, nah, never
'Cause I been on the road, been on the road, I
Quit actin' like you been with me this whole time
'Cause I been on the road, been on the road, I
Quit actin' like you been with me this whole time

[Verse 3: Lil Baby]
I'm tired of bein' tired
This my last shot, you can't be mad, at least I tried
We supposed to be grown, but yet you still acting childish
I can get on the jet alone, I don't need no extra baggage
This year turned into a savage, I got baguettes in my necklace
Driving fast and I won't crash it and I'm supposed to be sober
But some kind of way, I just keep getting loaded
It's gonna take more than some pressure to fold me
Tried as hard as I can, but at this point it's outta my hands
I ain't runnin' out of these bands for nothin' or no one
She say I'm a dog, but it takes one to know one
Been goin' hard, been by myself, I don't need no love

[Chorus: Post Malone]
'Cause they ain't ever seein' me fold under pressure
They ain't never, ever seen me fold, nah, never
Always keep one up on 'em 'cause I'm too clever
I would never, ever sell my soul, nah, never
'Cause I been on the road, been on the road, I
Quit actin' like you been with me this whole time
'Cause I been on the road, been on the road, I
Quit actin' like you been with me this whole time

[Outro: Post Malone]
Mm, oh, oh no
Mm, oh, oh no
On the road, oh

[Verse 1]
I done drank codeine from a broken whiskey glass
I done popped my pills and I smoked my share of grass
Slaved for the man and I broke my fuckin' back
So you can take your nine-to-five and shove it up your ass
And that 101 like the highway in hell
Going too damn fast, I spilled drink on my Chanel
And I woke up and my room's fuckin' trashed like a damn hotel
And where I'm goin' next now? Only time will tell

[Chorus]
Whoa-oh
Whoa-oh
Whoa-oh
Whoa-oh

[Verse 2]
I done spent some time chasin' women that don't give a shit
I done learned my lessons and I ain't never gon' forget
Started callin' this shit, started ballin' and shit, started flickin' that wrist
They ain't never listened, now I'm makin' them hits so I'm fuckin' your bitch 
No, it ain't that difficult for me to forget that you ever exist
Bet you remember my name when I pull up in that whip that doesn't exist 
Spill lean on Supreme last Saturday
Let that shit splash, motherfucker talk saucey
Pass me them drugs, motherfucker let me try 'em
At the White House, call my homie Joe Biden, he flyin' out weed
Smokin' my dope, Bathing Ape, that be the clothe
Man, don't be silly, that shit you rockin' is old
Like it's years since you been to the store
Feel like Meek Milly but I ain't from Philly
I'm poppin' a wheelie, I show off my grillie
I do this for real-y and for my fam-ily
Same shit every night, man, it's all so famil'-y
The bitches they killin' me
Like, bitch, are you kiddin' me?
Ballin', that shit Jason Kiddin' me
You can't get rid of me
Yeah you want my chain and my chi bitch Im real good at chemistry

[Chorus]
Whoa-oh
Whoa-oh
Whoa-oh
Whoa-oh

Say you flexin', that's a big lie
Say you flexin', that's a big lie

Ooh, valet the park on the whip
The Caddy, the '76

They don't want no part in that shit

I just grab a Bud and I pop the top on you, pour that water 

[Pre-Chorus]
Say you flexin', that's a big lie

[Pre-Chorus]
Say you flexin', that's a big lie

[Outro]
I know, I know

[Verse 1]
First things first
I'ma say all the words inside my head
I'm fired up and tired of the way that things have been, oh-ooh
The way that things have been, oh-ooh
Second thing second
Don't you tell me what you think that I could be
I'm the one at the sail, I'm the master of my sea, oh-ooh
The master of my sea, oh-ooh

[Pre-Chorus]
I was broken from a young age
Taking my sulkin' to the masses
Writing my poems for the few
That look at me, took to me, shook at me, feelin' me
Singing from heartache from the pain
Taking my message from the veins
Speaking my lesson from the brain
Seeing the beauty through the...

[Chorus]
Pain! You made me a, you made me a believer, believer
Pain! You break me down and build me up, believer, believer
Pain! Oh, let the bullets fly, oh, let them rain
My life, my love, my drive, it came from...
Pain! You made me a, you made me a believer, believer

[Verse 2]
Third things third
Send a prayer to the ones up above
All the hate that you've heard has turned your spirit to a dove, oh-ooh
Your spirit up above, oh-ooh

[Pre-Chorus]
I was chokin' in the crowd
Building my rain up in the cloud
Falling like ashes to the ground
Hoping my feelings, they would drown
But they never did, ever lived, ebbin' and flowin'
Inhibited, limited 'til it broke open and rained down
It rained down, like...

[Chorus]
Pain! You made me a, you made me a believer, believer
Pain! You break me down and build me up, believer, believer
Pain! Oh, let the bullets fly, oh, let them rain
My life, my love, my drive, it came from...
Pain! You made me a, you made me a believer, believer

[Bridge]
Last things last
By the grace of the fire and the flames
You're the face of the future, the blood in my veins, oh-ooh
The blood in my veins, oh-ooh
But they never did, ever lived, ebbin' and flowin'
Inhibited, limited 'til it broke open and rained down
It rained down, like...

[Chorus]
Pain! You made me a, you made me a believer, believer
Pain! You break me down and build me up, believer, believer
Pain! Oh, let the bullets fly, oh, let them rain
My life, my love, my drive, it came from...
Pain! You made me a, you made me a believer, believer

[Verse 1]
Just a young gun with a quick fuse
I was uptight, wanna let loose
I was dreaming of bigger things
And wanna leave my own life behind
Not a "Yes, sir," not a follower
Fit the box, fit the mold
Have a seat in the foyer, take a number
I was lightning before the thunder

[Pre-Chorus]
Thunder, thunder
Thunder, thun-
Thunder, th-th-thunder, thunder
Thunder, thunder, thun-
Thunder, th-th-thunder, thunder

[Chorus]
Thunder, feel the thunder 
Lightning then the thunder 
Thunder, feel the thunder 
Lightning then the thunder, thunder, thunder 
Thunder 

[Verse 2]
Kids were laughing in my classes
While I was scheming for the masses
Who do you think you are?
Dreaming 'bout being a big star
They say, "You're basic," they say, "You're easy"
You're always riding in the backseat
Now I'm smiling from the stage
While you were clapping in the nosebleeds

[Pre-Chorus]
Thunder, thunder
Thunder, thun-
Thunder, th-th-thunder, thunder
Thunder, thunder, thun-
Thunder, th-th-thunder, thunder

[Chorus]
Thunder, feel the thunder 
Lightning then the thunder 
Thunder, feel the thunder 
Lightning then the thunder, thunder, thunder 
Thunder 

[Bridge]
Thunder, feel the thunder
Lightning then the thunder, thunder

[Chorus]
Thunder, feel the thunder 
Lightning then the thunder, thunder 
Thunder, feel the thunder 
Lightning then the thunder, thunder 
Thunder, feel the thunder 

Lightning then the thunder, thunder 

Thunder, feel the thunder 

Lightning then the thunder, thunder 


[Outro]
Thunder, thunder, thun-
Thunder, th-th-thunder, thunder
Thunder, thunder, thun-
Thunder, th-th-thunder, thunder

Thunder, thunder, thun-
Thunder, th-th-thunder, thunder

Thunder, thunder, thun-
Thunder, th-th-thunder, thunder

[Verse 1]
Falling too fast to prepare for this
Tripping in the world could be dangerous
Everybody circling is vulturous
Negative, nepotist
Everybody waiting for the fall of man
Everybody praying for the end of times
Everybody hoping they could be the one
I was born to run, I was born for this

[Pre-Chorus]
Whip, whip
Run me like a racehorse
Pull me like a ripcord
Break me down and build me up
I wanna be the slip, slip
Word upon your lip, lip
Letter that you rip, rip
Break me down and build me up

[Chorus]
Whatever it takes
'Cause I love the adrenaline in my veins
I do whatever it takes
'Cause I love how it feels when I break the chains
Whatever it takes
Yeah, take me to the top
I'm ready for whatever it takes
'Cause I love the adrenaline in my veins
I do what it takes

[Verse 2]
Always had a fear of being typical
Looking at my body feeling miserable
Always hanging on to the visual
I wanna be invisible
Looking at my years like a martyrdom
Everybody needs to be a part of 'em
Never be enough, I'm the prodigal son
I was born to run, I was born for this

[Pre-Chorus]
Whip, whip
Run me like a racehorse
Pull me like a ripcord
Break me down and build me up
I wanna be the slip, slip
Word upon your lip, lip
Letter that you rip, rip
Break me down and build me up

[Chorus]
Whatever it takes
'Cause I love the adrenaline in my veins
I do whatever it takes
'Cause I love how it feels when I break the chains
Whatever it takes
Yeah, take me to the top
I'm ready for whatever it takes
'Cause I love the adrenaline in my veins
I do what it takes

[Bridge]
Hypocritical, egotistical
Don't wanna be the parenthetical, hypothetical
Working hard on something that I'm proud of, out of the box
An epoxy to the world and the vision we've lost
I'm an apostrophe
I'm just a symbol to remind you that there's more to see
I'm just a product of the system, a catastrophe
And yet a masterpiece, and yet I'm half-diseased
And when I am deceased
At least I'll go down to the grave and die happily
And leave the body and the soul to be a part of thee
I do what it takes

[Chorus]
Whatever it takes
'Cause I love the adrenaline in my veins
I do whatever it takes
'Cause I love how it feels when I break the chains
Whatever it takes
Yeah, take me to the top
I'm ready for whatever it takes
'Cause I love the adrenaline in my veins
I do what it takes

[Verse 1]
When the days are cold and the cards all fold
And the saints we see are all made of gold
When your dreams all fail and the ones we hail
Are the worst of all, and the blood's run stale

[Pre-Chorus]
I wanna hide the truth, I wanna shelter you
But with the beast inside, there's nowhere we can hide
No matter what we breed, we still are made of greed
This is my kingdom come, this is my kingdom come

[Chorus]
When you feel my heat, look into my eyes
It's where my demons hide, it's where my demons hide
Don't get too close; it's dark inside
It's where my demons hide, it's where my demons hide

[Verse 2]
At the curtain's call it's the last of all
When the lights fade out, all the sinners crawl
So they dug your grave and the masquerade
Will come calling out at the mess you've made

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't wanna let you down, but I am hell-bound
Though this is all for you, don't wanna hide the truth
No matter what we breed, we still are made of greed
This is my kingdom come, this is my kingdom come

[Chorus]
When you feel my heat, look into my eyes
It's where my demons hide, it's where my demons hide
Don't get too close; it's dark inside
It's where my demons hide, it's where my demons hide

[Bridge]
They say it's what you make, I say it's up to fate
It's woven in my soul, I need to let you go
Your eyes, they shine so bright, I wanna save that light
I can't escape this now, unless you show me how

[Chorus]
When you feel my heat, look into my eyes
It's where my demons hide, it's where my demons hide
Don't get too close; it's dark inside
It's where my demons hide, it's where my demons hide

[Intro]
Whoah-oh
Whoah-oh

Whoah

[Verse 1]
I'm waking up to ash and dust
I wipe my brow and I sweat my rust
I'm breathing in the chemicals
Yeah, ah

[Refrain]
I'm breaking in, shaping up
Then checking out on the prison bus
This is it, the apocalypse
Whoa

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm waking up, I feel it in my bones
Enough to make my system blow
Welcome to the new age, to the new age
Welcome to the new age, to the new age

[Chorus]
Whoa-oh, whoa
I'm radioactive, radioactive
Whoa-oh, whoa
I'm radioactive, radioactive

[Verse 2]
I raise my flags, dye my clothes
It's a revolution, I suppose
We're painted red to fit right in
Whoa

[Refrain]
I'm breaking in, shaping up
Then checking out on the prison bus
This is it, the apocalypse
Whoa

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm waking up, I feel it in my bones
Enough to make my system blow
Welcome to the new age, to the new age
Welcome to the new age, to the new age

[Chorus]
Whoa-oh, whoa
I'm radioactive, radioactive
Whoa-oh, whoa
I'm radioactive, radioactive

[Bridge]
All systems go, the sun hasn't died
Deep in my bones, straight from inside

I'm waking up, I feel it in my bones
Enough to make my system blow
Welcome to the new age, to the new age
Welcome to the new age, to the new age

[Chorus]
Whoa-oh, whoa
I'm radioactive, radioactive
Whoa-oh, whoa
I'm radioactive, radioactive

[Verse 1]
Will you hold the line
When every one of them has given up and given in? Tell me
In this house of mine
Nothing ever comes without a consequence or cost, tell me
Will the stars align?
Will Heaven step in? Will it save us from our sin? Will it?
'Cause this house of mine stands strong

[Pre-Chorus]
That's the price you pay
Leave behind your heart and cast away
Just another product of today
Rather be the hunter than the prey
And you're standing on the edge, face up 'cause you're a

[Chorus]
Natural
A beating heart of stone
You gotta be so cold
To make it in this world
Yeah, you're a natural
Living your life cutthroat
You gotta be so cold
Yeah, you're a natural

[Verse 2]
Will somebody
Let me see the light within the dark trees shadowing?
What's happenin'?
Lookin' through the glass, find the wrong within the past knowin'
Oh, we are the youth
Cut until it bleeds inside a world without the peace, facing
A bit of the truth, the truth

[Pre-Chorus]
That's the price you pay
Leave behind your heart and cast away
Just another product of today
Rather be the hunter than the prey
And you're standing on the edge, face up 'cause you're a

[Chorus]
Natural
A beating heart of stone
You gotta be so cold
To make it in this world
Yeah, you're a natural
Living your life cutthroat
You gotta be so cold
Yeah, you're a natural

[Bridge]
Deep inside me, I'm fading to black, I'm fading
Took an oath by the blood of my hand, won't break it
I can taste it, the end is upon us, I swear
I'm gonna make it
I'm gonna make it

[Chorus]
Natural
A beating heart of stone
You gotta be so cold
To make it in this world
Yeah, you're a natural
Living your life cutthroat
You gotta be so cold
Yeah, you're a natural

[Outro]
Natural
Yeah, you're a natural

[Verse 1: Dan Reynolds]
I'm wakin' up to ash and dust
I wipe my brow and I sweat my rust
I'm breathin' in the chemicals
I'm breakin' in, shapin' up
The checkin' out on the prison bus
This is it, the apocalypse, whoa

[Pre-Chorus: Dan Reynolds]
I'm wakin' up, I feel it in my bones
Enough to make my systems blow

[Bridge: Dan Reynolds]
All systems go, sun hasn't died
Deep in my bones, straight from inside

[Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar]
Bury me alive, bury me with pride
Bury me with berries, that forbidden fruit and cherry wine
Thank you berry much, but tonight's my night and I'm Barry Bonds
Swingin' for the fences, barbaric Kendrick in idle time
Everything in life's subject to change, change whip, change grind
Change clothes, change opinions, right before I change my mind
I don't really know yah business, been in there since I was bendin' Lego blocks
Now you tell the world about me, dry snitch
Tater tots on my shotgun, now I gotta pop one at the stars
Sky's the limit, I gotta finish as the first rapper on Mars
Mark my word, I'ma make my mark, even when they start their Martial Law
Even when these Martians alienate, my mental state is still at heart
Fuck, look in my eyes, tell me I died, tell me I tried, to compromise
Tell me you love me, tell me that I, don't give a fuck and can barely decide
Wishin' good luck on my enemies, all of my energy go to the almighty God
I could drown in a bottle of Hennessy, fuck your amenities, I'm gettin' better with time
AHHHHH!

[Pre-Chorus: Dan Reynolds]
I'm wakin' up, I feel it in my bones
Enough to make my systems blow
Welcome to the new age, to the new age
Welcome to the new age, to the new age

Whoa, whoa, I'm radioactive, radioactive
Whoa, whoa, I'm radioactive, radioactive

[Outro: Dan Reynolds]
I'm radioactive, radioactive

[Verse 1]
Oh, hush, my dear, it's been a difficult year
And terrors dont prey on innocent victims
Trust me, darlin', trust me darlin'
Its been a loveless year
I'm a man of three fears:
Integrity, faith, and crocodile tears
Trust me, darlin', trust me, darlin'

[Pre-Chorus]
So look me in the eyes , tell me what you see 
Perfect paradise , tearin' at the seams 
I wish I could escape it , I don't wanna fake it
Wish I could erase it , make your heart believe

[Chorus]
But I'm a bad liar, bad liar
Now you know, now you know
I'm a bad liar, bad liar
Now you know, youre free to go

[Verse 2]
Did all my dreams never mean one thing?
Does happiness lie in a diamond ring?
Oh, Ive been askin' for
Oh, Ive been askin' for problems, problems, problems
I wage my war, on the world inside
I take my gun to the enemy's side
Oh, I've been askin for 
Oh, I've been askin' for  problems, problems, problems

[Pre-Chorus]
So look me in the eyes , tell me what you see 
Perfect paradise , tearin' at the seams 
I wish I could escape it , I don't wanna fake it
Wish I could erase it , make your heart believe

[Chorus]
But I'm a bad liar, bad liar
Now you know, now you know
I'm a bad liar, bad liar
Now you know, you're free to go

[Bridge]
I can't breathe, I can't be
I can't be what you want me to be
Believe me, this one time
Believe me

[Chorus]
I'm a bad liar, bad liar
Now you know, now you know
I'm a bad liar, bad liar
Now you know, you're free to go

[Outro]
Oh-oh-oh
Please believe me
Please believe me

[Verse 1]
There she goes in front of me
Take my life and set me free again
We'll make a memory out of it
Holy road is at my back
Don't look on, take me back again
We'll make a memory out of it

[Pre-Chorus]
We finally fall apart
And we break each other's hearts
If we wanna live young, love
We better start today

[Chorus]
It's gotta get easier and easier somehow
'Cause I'm falling, I'm falling
Oh, easier and easier somehow
Oh, I'm calling, I'm calling
And it isn't over unless it is over
I don't wanna wait for that
It's gotta get easier and easier somehow
But not today, not today

[Verse 2]
There she goes in front of me
Take my life, set me free again
We'll make a memory out of it
Holy road was at my back
Don't look on, take me back again
We'll make a memory out of it

We finally fall apart
And we break each other's hearts
If we wanna live young, love
We better start today

It's gotta get easier and easier

You'll come with me
So come with me
You'll come with me
Not today

It's gotta get easier and easier somehow
It's gotta get easier and easier somehow
Not today, not today

[Verse 1]
Something about the way that you walked into my living room
Casually and confident lookin' at the mess I am
But still you, still you want me
Stress lines and cigarettes, politics, and deficits
Late bills and overages, screamin' and hollerin'
But still you, still you want me

[Chorus]
Oh, I always let you down
You're shattered on the ground
But still, I find you there
Next to me
And oh, stupid things I do
I'm far from good, it's true
But still, I find you
Next to me 

[Verse 2]
There's something about the way that you always see the pretty view
Overlook the blooded mess, always lookin' effortless
And still you, still you want me
I got no innocence, faith ain't no privilege
I am a deck of cards, vice or a game of hearts
And still you, still you want me

[Chorus]
Oh, I always let you down
You're shattered on the ground
But still, I find you there
Next to me
And oh, stupid things I do
I'm far from good, it's true
But still, I find you
Next to me 

[Bridge]
Oh
So thank you for taking a chance on me
I know it isn't easy
But I hope to be worth it 
So thank you for taking a chance on me
I know it isn't easy
But I hope to be worth it 

[Music Film Aja's Revelation]

[Chorus]
Oh, I always let you down 
You're shattered on the ground, 
But still, I find you there 
Next to me
And, oh, stupid things I do 
I'm far from good, it's true
But still, I find you
Next to me 

[Music Film Closing Dialogue]

[Verse 1]
Do you feel the same when I'm away from you? 
Do you know the line that I'd walk for you? 
We could turn around or we could give it up
But we'll take what comes, take what comes

[Verse 2]
Oh, the storm is ragin' against us now 
If you're afraid of falling, then don't look down 
But we took the step, oh, we took the leap
And we'll take what comes, take what comes

[Pre-Chorus]
Feel the wind in your hair
Feel the rush way up here

[Chorus]
We're walkin' the wire, love
We're walkin' the wire, love
We couldn't be higher, up
We're walkin' the wire, wire, wire

[Verse 3]
There's nights we had to just walk away 
And there's tears we'll cry, but those tears will fade 
It's a price you pay when it comes to love
And we'll take what comes, take what comes

[Pre-Chorus]
Feel the wind in your hair
Feel the rush way up here

[Chorus]
We're walkin' the wire, love
We're walkin' the wire, love
We couldn't be higher, up
We're walkin' the wire, wire, wire

[Bridge]
So look out down below
Look out down below
Look out down below
Walkin' the wire, wire, wire
So look out down below

[Verse 4]
Oh, I'll take your hand when thunder roars
And I'll hold you close, I'll stay the course
I promise you from up above
That we'll take what comes, take what comes, love

[Chorus]
We're walkin' the wire, love
We're walkin' the wire, love
We couldn't be higher, up 
We're walkin' the wire, wire, wire

[Outro]
So look out down below
Look out down below
Look out down below
Walkin' the wire, wire, wire
So look out down below
We're walkin' the wire
We're walkin' the wire
We're walkin' the wire, wire, wire

[Verse 1]
So this is what you meant
When you said that you were spent
And now it's time to build from the bottom of the pit
Right to the top
Don't hold back
Packing my bags and giving the academy a rain check

[Pre-Chorus]
I don't ever wanna let you down
I don't ever wanna leave this town
'Cause after all
This city never sleeps at night

[Chorus]
It's time to begin, isn't it?
I get a little bit bigger, but then I'll admit
I'm just the same as I was
Now don't you understand
That I'm never changing who I am

[Verse 2]
So this is where you fell
And I am left to sell
The path to heaven runs through miles of clouded hell
Right to the top
Don't look back
Turn in the rags and giving the commodities a rain check

[Pre-Chorus]
I don't ever wanna let you down
I don't ever wanna leave this town
'Cause after all
This city never sleeps at night

[Chorus]
It's time to begin, isn't it?
I get a little bit bigger, but then I'll admit
I'm just the same as I was
Now don't you understand
That I'm never changing who I am
It's time to begin, isn't it?
I get a little bit bigger, but then I'll admit
I'm just the same as I was
Now don't you understand
That I'm never changing who I am

[Bridge]
This road never looked so lonely
This house doesn't burn down slowly
To ashes, to ashes

[Chorus]
It's time to begin, isn't it?
I get a little bit bigger, but then I'll admit
I'm just the same as I was
Now don't you understand
That I'm never changing who I am
It's time to begin, isn't it?
I get a little bit bigger, but then I'll admit
I'm just the same as I was
Now don't you understand
That I'm never changing who I am

[Verse 1]
I find it hard to say the things I want to say the most
Find a little bit of steady as I get close
Find a balance in the middle of the chaos
Send me low, send me high, send me never demigod
I remember walking in the cold of November
Hoping that I make it to the end of December
27 years and the end on my mind
But holding to the thought of another time

[Pre-Chorus]
But looking to the ways of the ones before me
Looking for the path of the young and lonely
I don't wanna hear about what to do
I dont wanna do it just to do it for you

[Chorus]
Hello, hello
Let me tell you what it's like to be a zero, zero
Let me show you what it's like to always feel, feel
Like Im empty and there's nothing really real, real
I'm looking for a way out
Hello, hello
Let me tell you what it's like to be a zero, zero
Let me show you what it's like to never feel, feel
Like I'm good enough for anything that's real, real
I'm looking for a way out

[Verse 2]
I find it hard to tell you how I wanna run away
I understand it always makes you feel a certain way
I find a balance in the middle of the chaos
Send me up, send me down, send me nother demigod
I remember walking in the heat of the summer
Wide-eyed one with a mind full of wonder
27 years and Ive nothing to show
Falling from the dove to the dark of the crow

[Pre-Chorus]
Looking to the ways of the ones before me
Looking for the path of the young and lonely
I don't wanna hear about what to do, no
I dont wanna do it just to do it for you

[Chorus]
Hello, hello
Let me tell you what it's like to be a zero, zero
Let me show you what it's like to always feel, feel
Like I'm empty and theres nothing really real, real
I'm looking for a way out
Hello, hello
Let me tell you what it's like to be a zero, zero
Let me show you what it's like to never feel, feel
Like I'm good enough for anything that's real, real
I'm looking for a way out

[Bridge]
Let me tell you 'bout it, well let me tell you 'bout it
Maybe you're the same as me
Let me tell you 'bout it, well let me tell you 'bout it
They say the truth will set you free

[Chorus]
Hello, hello
Let me tell you what it's like to be a zero, zero
Let me show you what it's like to always feel, feel
Like I'm empty and there's nothing really real, real
I'm looking for a way out
Hello, hello
Let me tell you what it's like to be a zero, zero
Let me show you what it's like to never feel, feel
Like I'm good enough for anything that's real, real
I'm looking for a way out

[Verse 1]
I was hopin' for an indication
I was seekin' higher elevation
Aye aye aye, aye aye aye
I've been shaken, wakin' in the night light
I've been breakin', hidin' from the spotlight
Aye aye aye, aye aye aye

[Pre-Chorus]
The more I stray, the less I fear
And the more I reach, the more I fade away
The darkness right in front of me
Oh, it's calling out, and I won't walk away

[Chorus]
I would always open up the door
Always lookin' up for higher floors
Wanna see it all give me more 
I was always up for makin' changes
Walkin' down the street meetin' strangers
Flippin' through my life turnin' pages 

[Verse 2]
Like a prayer that only needs a reason
Like a hunter waiting for the season
Aye aye aye, aye aye aye
I was there, but I was always leaving
I've been livin', but I was never breathing
Aye aye aye, aye aye aye

[Pre-Chorus]
The more I stray, the less I fear
And the more I reach, the more I fade away
The darkness right in front of me
Oh, it's calling out, and I won't walk away

[Chorus]
I would always open up the door
Always lookin' up for higher floors
Wanna see it all give me more 
I was always up for makin' changes
Walkin' down the street meetin' strangers
Flippin' through my life turnin' pages 

[Bridge]
I'm burstin' like the Fourth of July
So color me and blow me away
I'm broken in the prime of my life
So embrace it and leave me to stray

[Chorus]
I would always open up the door
Always lookin' up for higher floors
Wanna see it all give me more 
I was always up for makin' changes
Walkin' down the street meetin' strangers
Flippin' through my life turnin' pages 
I would always open up the door
Always lookin' up for higher floors
Want to see it all give me more 
I was always up for makin' changes
Walkin' down the street meetin' strangers
Flippin' through my life turnin' pages 

[Outro]

[Verse 1]
We could be strangers in the night
We could be passing in the shadows
We couldn't be closer if we tried
When we're caught in the headlights
We could be faces in the crowd
We could be passin' in the shadows
Lovin' the risk of bein' found
When we're caught in the headlights

[Pre-Chorus]
Dangerous
Your love is always dangerous
And now I'm lost in us
We're livin' in a lie of trust

[Chorus]
I don't know why
But I guess it's got somethin' to do with you
To do with you
I don't know why
But I guess it's got somethin' to do with you
To do with you

[Verse 2]
I was a vacant alibi
Trading the truth in for a lie, oh
We were the essence of desire
And we're caught in the headlights

[Pre-Chorus]
Dangerous
Your love is always dangerous
And now I'm lost in us
We're livin' in a lie of trust

[Chorus]
I don't know why
But I guess it's got somethin' to do with you
To do with you
I don't know why
But I guess it's got somethin' to do with you
To do with you 
I don't know why
But I guess it's got somethin' to do with you 
To do with you 
I don't know why
But I guess it's got somethin' to do with you
To do with you

[Bridge]
Tell me that you love me
Tell me that you love me
Tell me that you love me
Tell me that you love me
Tell me that you love me
Dangerous
Tell me that you love me
Tell me that you love me
Your love is always dangerous
Tell me that you love me

[Breakdown]
I don't know why

[Chorus]
I don't know why 
But I guess it's got somethin' to do with you 
To do with you 
I don't know why
But I guess it's got somethin' to do with you 
To do with you 
I don't know why
But I guess it's got somethin' to do with you  
To do with you 
I don't know why
But I guess it's got somethin' to do with you
To do with you

[Verse 1]
If you love somebody
Better tell them while they're here 'cause
They just may run away from you
You'll never know quite when, well
Then again, it just depends on
How long of time is left for you
I've had the highest mountains
I've had the deepest rivers
You can have it all, but life keeps moving

[Pre-Chorus]
Now take it in but don't look down...

[Chorus]
'Cause I'm on top of the world, hey
I'm on top of the world, hey
Waiting on this for a while now
Paying my dues to the dirt
I've been waiting to smile, hey
Been holding it in for a while, hey
Take you with me if I can
Been dreaming of this since a child
I'm on top of the world

[Verse 2]
I've tried to cut these corners
Try to take the easy way out
I kept on falling short of something
I could've gave up then, but
Then again, I couldn't have 'cause
I've traveled all this way for something

[Pre-Chorus]
Now take it in, but don't look down...

[Chorus]
'Cause I'm on top of the world, hey
I'm on top of the world, hey
Waiting on this for a while now
Paying my dues to the dirt
I've been waiting to smile, hey
Been holding it in for a while, hey
Take you with me if I can
Been dreaming of this since a child
I'm on top of the world

[Post-Chorus]
Oh-woah, oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh-woah, oh-oh

[Chorus]
'Cause I'm on top of the world, hey
I'm on top of the world, hey
Waiting on this for a while now
Paying my dues to the dirt
I've been waiting to smile, hey
Been holding it in for a while, hey
Take you with me if I can
Been dreaming of this since a child

[Bridge]
And I know it's hard when you're falling down
And it's a long way up when you hit the ground, but
Get up, now, get up, get up, now
And I know it's hard when you're falling down
And it's a long way up when you hit the ground, but
Get up, now, get up, get up, now

[Outro]
'Cause I'm on top of the world, hey

I'm on top of the world, hey

Waiting on this for a while now

Paying my dues to the dirt

I've been waiting to smile, hey

Been holding it in for a while, hey

Take you with me if I can

Been dreaming of this since a child

I'm on top of the world

[Verse 1]
As a child, you would wait and watch from far away
But you always knew that you'd be the one
That work while they all play
In youth, you'd lay awake at night and scheme
Of all the things that you would change
But it was just a dream

[Chorus]
Here we are, don't turn away now 
We are the warriors that built this town 
Here we are, don't turn away now 
We are the warriors that built this town 
From dust

[Verse 2]
The time will come, when you'll have to rise
Above the rest and prove yourself
Your spirit never dies
Farewell, I've gone to take my throne above
But don't weep for me, 'cause this will be
The labor of my love

[Chorus]
Here we are, don't turn away now 
We are the warriors that built this town 
Here we are, don't turn away now 
We are the warriors that built this town 
From dust

[Guitar Solo]

[Chorus]
Here we are, don't turn away now 
We are the warriors that built this town 
Here we are, don't turn away now 
We are the warriors that built this town 
From dust

[Verse 1]
Two hearts, one valve
Pumpin' the blood, we were the flood
We were the body and
Two lives, one life
Stickin' it out, lettin' you down
Makin' it right

[Pre-Chorus]
Seasons, they will change
Life will make you grow
Change will make you cry, cry, cry
Everything is temporary
Everything will slide
Love will never die, die, die

[Chorus]
I know that
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Birds fly in different directions
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
I hope to see you again

[Verse 2]
Sunsets, sunrises
Livin' the dream, watchin' the leaves
Changin' the seasons
Some nights I think of you
Relivin' the past, wishin' it'd last
Wishin' and dreamin'

[Pre-Chorus]
Seasons, they will change
Life will make you grow
Death can make you hard, hard, hard
Everything is temporary
Everything will slide
Love will never die, die, die

[Chorus]
I know that
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Birds fly in different directions
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
I hope to see you again
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Birds fly in different directions
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
So fly high, so fly high

[Bridge]
When the moon is lookin' down
Shinin' light upon your ground
I'm flyin' up to let you see
That the shadow cast is me

[Chorus]
I know that
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Birds fly in different directions
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
I hope to see you again
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Birds fly in different directions
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
So fly high, so fly high
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
So fly high, so fly high
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
So fly high, so fly high

[Verse 1]
All my life been sittin' at the table
Watchin' them kids, they're living in a fable
Looks, luck, money and never left a'wishin'
But now it's 'bout time to raise up and petition
All my life been sittin' at the table
Watching them kids, they're living in a fable
Looks, luck, money and never left a'wishin'
Now it's 'bout time to stand up and petition

[Chorus]
'Cause I've been wondering
When you gonna see I'm not for sale
I've been questioning
When you gonna see I'm not a part of your machine
Not a part of your machine

[Verse 2]
I'm not scared of what you're gonna tell me
No, I'm not scared of the beast in the belly
Fill my cup with endless ambition
And paint this town with my very own vision
I'm not scared of what you're gonna tell me
And I'm not scared of the beast in the belly
Fill my cup with endless ambition
And paint this town with my very own vision

[Chorus]
'Cause I've been wondering
When you gonna see I'm not for sale
I've been questioning
When you gonna see I'm not a part of your machine
Not a part of your machine
I am the machine

[Guitar Solo]
I am the machine

[Outro]
'Cause I've been wondering
When you gonna see I'm not for sale
I've been questioning
When you gonna see I'm not a part of your machine
Not a part of your machine
'Cause I've been wondering
When you gonna see I'm not for sale
I've been questioning
When you gonna see I'm not a part of your machine
Not a part of your machine
I am the machine

[Intro]

[Verse 1]
About time for anyone telling you
Off for all your deeds
No sign the roaring thunder
Stopped in cold to read 

[Pre-Chorus]
I get mine and make no excuses
Waste of precious breath 
The sun shines on everyone
Everyone, love yourself to death

[Chorus]
So you gotta fire up, you gotta let go
You'll never be loved 'til youve made your own
You gotta face up, you gotta get yours
You never know the top 'til you get too low

[Post-Chorus]
A son of a stepfather
A son of a, I'm so sorry
A son of a stepfather
A son of a, I'm so sorry

[Verse 2]
No lies and no deceiving
Man is what he loves
I keep tryin' to conceive that
Death is from above 

[Pre-Chorus]
I get mine and make no excuses
Waste of precious breath 
The sun shines on everyone
Everyone, love yourself to death

[Chorus]
So you gotta fire up, you gotta let go
You'll never be loved 'til youve made your own
You gotta face up, you gotta get yours
You never know the top 'til you get too low

[Post-Chorus]
A son of a stepfather
A son of a, I'm so sorry
A son of a stepfather
A son of a, I'm so sorry

[Bridge]
Life isn't always what you think itd be
Turn your head for one second and the tables turn
And I know, I know that I did you wrong
But will you trust me when I say that I'll make it up to you?
Somehow, somehow?

[Chorus]
So you gotta fire up, you gotta let go
You'll never be loved 'til youve made your own
You gotta face up, you gotta get yours
You never know the top 'til you get too low

[Post-Chorus]
A son of a stepfather
A son of a, I'm so sorry
A son of a stepfather
A son of a, I'm so sorry
I'm so sorry
I'm so sorry
I'm so sorry
A son of a

[Outro: Guitar Solo]

[Intro]





[Verse 1]
I know I took the path
That you would never want for me
I know I let you down, didn't I?
So many sleepless nights
Where you were waiting up on me
Well, I'm just a slave unto the night

[Pre-Chorus]

Now remember when I told you 
That's the last you'll see of me? 
Remember when I broke you down to tears? 

I know I took the path
That you would never want for me 
I gave you hell through all the years 

[Chorus]
So I, I bet my life
I bet my life, I bet my life on you
I, I bet my life
I bet my life, I bet my life on you

[Verse 2]
I've been around the world
And never in my wildest dreams
Would I come runnin' home to you

I've told a million lies 
But now I tell a single truth 
There's you in everything I do 


[Pre-Chorus]
Now remember when I told you
That's the last you'll see of me?
Remember when I broke you down to tears?
I know I took the path
That you would never want for me
I gave you hell through all the years

[Chorus]
So I, I bet my life
I bet my life, I bet my life on you
I, I bet my life
I bet my life, I bet my life on you

[Bridge]
Don't tell me that I'm wrong
I've walked that road before
And left you on your own
And please believe them when they say
That it's left for yesterday
And the records that I play
Please forgive me for all I've done

[Chorus]
So I, I bet my life
I bet my life, I bet my life on you
I, I bet my life
I bet my life, I bet my life on you
Ehe-yee-eee
I, I bet my, I bet my, I bet my
O-yeee-eeah
I bet my
I, I bet my life, I bet my life, I bet my

[Introduction to Smoke + Mirrors]

[Intro]
I'm sorry for everything, oh, everything I've done

[Verse 1]
Am I out of touch? Am I out of my place
When I keep sayin' that I'm lookin' for an empty space?
Oh, I'm wishin' you're here
But I'm wishin' you're gone
I can't have you and I'm only gonna do you wrong

[Refrain]
Oh, I'm gonna mess this up
Oh, this is just my luck
Over and over and over again

[Chorus]
I'm sorry for everything, oh, everything I've done
From the second that I was born, it seems I had a loaded gun
And then I shot, shot, shot a hole
Through everything I loved
Oh, I shot, shot, shot a hole
Through every single thing that I loved

[Verse 2]
Am I out of luck? Am I waiting to break?
When I keep sayin' that I'm lookin' for a way to escape
Oh, I'm wishin' I had
What I'd taken for granted
I can't help you when I'm only gonna do you wrong

[Refrain]
Oh, I'm gonna mess this up
Oh, this is just my luck
Over and over and over again

[Chorus]
I'm sorry for everything, oh, everything I've done
From the second that I was born, it seems I had a loaded gun
And then I shot, shot, shot a hole
Through everything I loved
Oh, I shot, shot, shot a hole
Through every single thing that I loved

[Bridge]
In the meantime, we let it go
At the roadside we used to know
We can let this drift away
Oh, we let this drift away
At the bay side, where you used to show
In the moonlight, where we let it go
We can let this drift away
Oh, we let this drift away
And there's always time to change your mind
Oh, there's always time to change your mind
Oh, love, can you hear me?
Oh, let it drift away

[Chorus]
I'm sorry for everything, oh, everything I've done
From the second that I was born, it seems I had a loaded gun
And then I shot, shot, shot a hole
Through everything I loved
Oh, I shot, shot, shot a hole 
Through every single thing that I loved


[Outro]
In the meantime, we let it go
At the roadside we used to know
We can let this drift away
Oh, we let this drift away
At the bay side, where you used to show
In the moonlight, where we let it go
We can let this drift away
Oh, we let this drift away 
'Cause you've always got to change your mind
'Cause you've always got to change your mind
Oh, love, can you hear me?
Oh, let it drift away

[Verse 1]
Ever since I could remember
Everything inside of me
Just wanted to fit in 
I was never one for pretenders
Everything I tried to be
Just wouldn't settle in 

[Pre-Chorus]
If I told you what I was
Would you turn your back on me?
And if I seemed dangerous
Would you be scared?
I get the feeling just because
Everything I touch isn't dark enough
That this problem lies in me

[Chorus]
I'm only a man with a candle to guide me
I'm taking a stand to escape what's inside me
A monster, a monster
I've turned into a monster
A monster, a monster
And it keeps getting stronger

[Verse 2]
Can I clear my conscience
If I'm different from the rest?
Do I have to run and hide? 
I never said that I want this
This burden came to me
And it's made its home inside 

[Pre-Chorus]
If I told you what I was
Would you turn your back on me?
And if I seemed dangerous
Would you be scared?
I get the feeling just because
Everything I touch isn't dark enough
That this problem lies in me

[Chorus]
I'm only a man with a candle to guide me
I'm taking a stand to escape what's inside me
A monster, a monster
I've turned into a monster
A monster, a monster
And it keeps getting stronger

[Instrumental Interlude]

[Chorus]
I'm only a man with a candle to guide me
I'm taking a stand to escape what's inside me
A monster, a monster
I've turned into a monster
A monster, a monster
And it keeps getting stronger

[Verse 1]
I'm a reckless mistake
I'm a cold night's intake
I'm a one night too long
I'm a come on too strong

[Chorus]
All my life, I've been living in the fast lane
Can't slow down, I'm a rollin' freight train
One more time, gotta start all over
Can't slow down, I'm a lone red rover

[Verse 2]
I'm a hold my cards close
I'm a wreck what I love most
I'm a first class letdown
I'm a "shut up, sit down"

[Pre-Chorus 1]
I am a head case
I am the color of boom
That's never arriving
And you are the pay raise
Always a touch out of view
And I am the color of boom

[Chorus]
All my life, I've been living in the fast lane
Can't slow down, I'm a rolling freight train
One more time, gotta start all over
Can't slow down, I'm a lone red rover

[Hook]
Whoa, how did it come to this?
Oh, love is a polaroid, oh
Better in picture
 never can fill the void

[Verse 3]
I'm a midnight talker
Oh, I'm an alley walker
I'm a day late two-face
I'm a burn out quick pace

[Pre-Chorus 2]
I am a head case
I am the color of boom
That's never arriving
At you are the opera
Always on time and in tune
And I am the color of boom

[Chorus]
All my life, I've been living in the fast lane
Can't slow down, I'm a rolling freight train
One more time, gotta start all over
Can't slow down, I'm a lone red rover

[Hook]
Whoa, how did it come to this?
Oh, love is a polaroid, oh
Better in picture
 never can fill the void

[Bridge]
I'm gonna get ready
For the rain to pour heavy
Let it fall, fall
Let it fall upon my head

[Chorus]
All my life, I've been living in the fast lane
Can't slow down, I'm a rolling freight train
One more time, gotta start all over
Can't slow down, I'm a lone red rover

[Hook]
Whoa, how did it come to this?
Oh, love is a polaroid, oh
Better in picture
 never can fill the void

[Outro]
Oh, love is a polaroid
Oh, love is a polaroid

Oh, love is a polaroid

Love is a polaroid

[Verse 1]
In the dark, and I'm right on the middle mark
I'm just in the tier of everything that rides below the surface
And I watch from a distance seventeen
And I'm short of the others' dreams of being golden and on top
It's not what you painted in my head
There's so much there instead of all the colors that I saw

[Chorus]
We all are living in a dream
But life ain't what it seems
Oh everything's a mess
And all these sorrows I have seen
They lead me to believe
That everything's a mess

[Post-Chorus]
But I wanna dream
I wanna dream
Leave me to dream

[Verse 2]
In the eyes of a teenage crystallized
Oh, the prettiest of lights that hang the hallways of the home
And the cries from the strangers out at night
They don't keep us up at night
We have the curtains drawn and closed

[Chorus]
We all are living in a dream
But life ain't what it seems
Oh everything's a mess
And all these sorrows I have seen
They lead me to believe
That everything's a mess

[Post-Chorus]
But I wanna dream
I wanna dream
Leave me to dream

[Bridge]
I know all your reasons
To keep me from seeing
Everything is actually a mess
But now I am leaving
All of us were only dreaming
Everything is actually a mess

[Chorus]
We all are living in a dream
But life ain't what it seems
Oh everything's a mess
And all these sorrows I have seen
They lead me to believe
That everything's a mess

[Post-Chorus]
But I wanna dream
I wanna dream
Leave me to dream
But I wanna dream
I wanna dream
Leave me to dream

[Chorus]
I'm bleeding out
So if the last thing that I do
Is bring you down
I'll bleed out for you

So I bare my skin and I count my sins
And I close my eyes and I take it in
Im bleeding out
Im bleeding out for you, for you

[Verse 1]
When the day has come
That Ive lost my way around
And the seasons stop
And hide beneath the ground

When the sky turns grey
And everything is screaming
I will reach inside
Just to find my heart is beating

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, you tell me to hold on
Oh, you tell me to hold on
But innocence is gone
And what was right is wrong

[Chorus]
'Cause I'm bleeding out
So if the last thing that I do
Is bring you down
I'll bleed out for you

So I bare my skin and I count my sins
And I close my eyes and I take it in
And Im bleeding out
Im bleeding out for you, for you

[Verse 2]
When the hour is nigh
And hopelessness is sinking in
And the wolves all cry
To fill the night with hollering

When your eyes are red
And emptiness is all you know
With the darkness fed
I will be your scarecrow

[Pre-Chorus]
You tell me to hold on
Oh, you tell me to hold on
But innocence is gone
And what was right is wrong

[Chorus]
'Cause I'm bleeding out
So if the last thing that I do
Is bring you down
I'll bleed out for you

So I bare my skin and I count my sins
And I close my eyes and I take it in
And Im bleeding out
Im bleeding out for you, for you

[Bridge]
Im bleeding out for you, for you
Im bleeding out for you, for you
Im bleeding out for you, for you
Im bleeding out for you

[Chorus]
'Cause I'm bleeding out
So if the last thing that I do
Is bring you down
I'll bleed out for you

So I bare my skin and I count my sins
And I close my eyes and I take it in
And Im bleeding out
Im bleeding out for you, for you

[Verse 1]
Took your heart, took your hand
Promise you all that I had
Hopin' that you understand
Far from a perfect man

[Refrain]
'Cause, honey, it's been a hard year
It seem like we're goin' nowhere
Cryin' inside your bedroom
Baby, I know it's not fair

[Interlude]
Lay with me for one more night
I promise you, I'll make it right

[Chorus]
I'll make it up to you, you, you
Every night, I'll make it up to you, you, you
Every night, I'll make it up to you

[Verse 2]
I know you don't understand
The vices that follow a man
And in your eyes I can see
The places that you'd rather be

[Refrain]
'Cause, honey, it's been a hard year
It seem like we're goin' nowhere
You're cryin' inside your bedroom
Baby, I know it's not fair

[Chorus]
I'll make it up to you, you, you
Every night, I'll make it up to you, you, you
Every night, I'll make it up to you

[Bridge]
In our darkest hour
In the dead of the night
I'll make it up to you
Your hands are mine
I'll make it up to you
Promises are nothing more
Than fleetin' thoughts
But you, you are my lifeblood

[Chorus]
I'll make it up to you
Every night, I'll make it up to you
Every night, I'll make it up to you, you, you
Every night, I'll make it up to you, you, you
Every night, I'll make it up to you, you, you
Every night, I'll make it up to you

[Verse 1]
I'm sorry, mother, I'm sorry, I let you down
Well, these days I'm fine; no, these days I tend to lie
I'll take the Western train, just by the side of Amsterdam
Just by my left brain, just by the side of the Tin Man

[Verse 2]
I'm sorry, brother, I'm sorry, I let you down
Well, these days you're fine; no, these days you tend to lie
You'll take the Western train, just by the side of Amsterdam
Just by your left brain, just by the side of the Tin Man

[Chorus]
Your time will come
If you wait for it, if you wait for it
It's hard, believe me
I've tried, but I keep coming up short

[Verse 3]
I'm sorry, lover, I'm sorry I bring you down
Well, these days I try, and these days I tend to lie
Kinda thought it was a mystery, and then I thought it wasn't meant to be
You said yourself fantastically, "Congratulations, you are all alone!"

[Chorus]
Your time will come
If you wait for it, if you wait for it
It's hard, believe me
I've tried
Your time will come
If you wait for it, if you wait for it
It's hard, believe me
I've tried

[Bridge]
But the rain won't fall for the both of us
The sun won't shine on the both of us
Believe me when I say
That I wouldn't have it any other way

[Chorus]
Your time will come
If you wait for it, if you wait for it
It's hard, believe me
I've tried

[Outro]
But I won't wait much longer
'Cause these walls, they're crashing down
No, I won't wait much longer
'Cause these walls, they're crashing down
And I keep coming up short

[Verse 1]
Don't throw stones at me
Don't tell anybody

Trouble finds me 
All the noise of this
Has made me lose my belief


[Chorus]
I'm going back to my roots
Another day, another door
Another high, another low
Rock bottom, rock bottom, rock bottom
I'm going back to my roots
Another day, another door
Another high, another low
Rock bottom, rock bottom, rock bottom
I'm going back to my roots

[Verse 2]
Had to lose my way
To know which road to take

Trouble found me 
All I look for was
Washed away by a wave


[Chorus]
I'm going back to my roots
Another day, another door
Another high, another low
Rock bottom, rock bottom, rock bottom
I'm going back to my roots
Another day, another door
Another high, another low
Rock bottom, rock bottom, rock bottom
I'm going back to my roots

[Bridge]
I know it's gotta go like this, I know
Hell will always come before you grow
Trouble found me, trouble found me
I know it's gotta go like this, I know
Hell will always come before you grow
Trouble found me, trouble found me

[Chorus]
I'm going back to my roots
Another day, another door
Another high, another low
Rock bottom, rock bottom, rock bottom
I'm going back to my roots
Another day, another door
Another high, another low
Rock bottom, rock bottom, rock bottom
I'm going back to my roots

[Verse 1: Dan Reynolds]
First things first, I'ma say all the words inside my head
I'm fired up and tired of the way that things have been-oh, ooh
The way that things have been-oh, ooh
Second thing second, don't you tell me what you think that I could be
I'm the one at the sail, I'm the master of my sea-oh, ooh
The master of my sea-oh, ooh

[Pre-Chorus: Dan Reynolds]
I was broken from a young age
Takin' my sulkin' to the masses
Writin' my poems for the few
That look at me, took to me, shook to me, feelin' me
Singin' from heartache from the pain
Takin' my message from the veins
Speakin' my lesson from the brain
Seein' the beauty through the...

[Chorus: Dan Reynolds]
Pain! You made me a, you made me a believer, believer
Pain! You break me down, you build me up, believer, believer
Pain! Oh, let the bullets fly, oh, let them rain
My life, my love, my drive, it came from...
Pain! You made me a, you made me a believer, believer

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
First things first, can you imagine what's about to happen?
It's Weezy the dragon, I link with the Dragons
And we gon' get ratchet, no need for imaginin'
This is what's happenin'
Second thing second, I reckon immaculate
Sound about accurate
I know that strength, it don't come without strategy
I know that sweet, it don't come without cavities
I know the passages come with some traffic
I start from the basement, end up in the attic
And third thing third
Whoever count me out, they simply can't count
Let's get mathematic, I'm up in this, huh
Is you a believer?
I get a unicorn out of a zebra
I wear my uniform like a tuxedo
This dragon don't hold his breath, don't need a breather
Love you, Miss Cita, the son of a leader
I know the bloomin' don't come without rain
I know the losin' don't come without shame
I know the beauty don't come without hurt
Hold up, hold up
Last thing last
I know that Tunechi don't come without Wayne
I know that losin' don't come without gain
I know that beauty don't come without
Don't come without

[Chorus: Dan Reynolds]
Pain! You made me a, you made me a believer, believer
Pain! You break me down and build me up, believer, believer
Pain! Oh, let the bullets fly, oh, let them rain
My life, my love, my drive, it came from...
Pain! You made me a, you made me a believer, believer

[Bridge: Dan Reynolds]
Last things last, by the grace of the fire and the flames
You're the face of the future, the blood in my veins, oh-ooh
The blood in my veins, oh-ooh
But they never did, ever lived, ebbin' and flowin'
Inhibited, limited 'til it broke open and rained down
It rained down, like...

[Chorus: Dan Reynolds]
Pain! You made me a, you made me a believer, believer
Pain! You break me down and build me up, believer, believer
Pain! Oh, let the bullets fly, oh, let them rain
My life, my love, my drive, it came from...
Pain! You made me a, you made me a believer, believer

[Verse 1]
Don't throw my name 'round here like that
You could get us in some trouble
Talking that way and
Monday you got me, that's a fact
You could get me in some trouble
Talking that way and
I don't need nobody

[Pre-Chorus]
If you ever wanna join me baby, I'll be dancing in the dark
If you ever wanna join me baby, I'll be dancing in the dark

[Chorus]
Dancing in the...
Join me
Dancing in the...
Join me baby
Dancing in the...
Join me baby

[Verse 2]
Most days I'm keeping to myself, living in my little bubble
Throwing my weight and moving my body through the sea
You could come join me
Moving like the weekend
I don't need nobody

[Pre-Chorus]
If you ever wanna join me baby, I'll be dancing in the dark
If you ever wanna join me baby, I'll be dancing in the dark

[Chorus]
Dancing in the...
Join me
Dancing in the...
Join me baby
Dancing in the...
Join me baby
Dancing in the...
Join me baby

[Outro]
If you ever wanna join me baby, I'll be dancing in the dark
Dancing in the, join me baby
If you ever wanna join me baby, I'll be dancing in the dark
Baby
Dancing in the, baby

[Verse 1]
First comes a blessing of all that you've dreamed
But then comes the curses of diamonds and rings
Only at first did it have its appeal
But now you can't tell the false from the real

[Pre-Chorus]
Who can you trust?
Who can you trust?

[Chorus]
When everything, everything
Everything you touch turns to gold, gold, gold
Everything, everything
Everything you touch turns to gold, gold

[Post-Chorus]
Gold
Gold
Gold
Gold

[Verse 2]
Statues and empires are all at your hands
Water to wine and the finest of sands
When all that you have's turning stale and it's cold
Oh, you'll no longer feel when your heart's turned to gold

[Pre-Chorus]
Who can you trust?
Who can you trust?

[Chorus]
When everything, everything
Everything you touch turns to gold, gold, gold
Everything, everything
Everything you touch turns to gold, gold

[Post-Chorus]
Gold
Gold
Gold
Gold

[Bridge]
I'm dying to feel again
Oh, anything at all
But, oh, I feel nothing
Nothing
Nothing
Nothing

[Chorus]
When everything, everything
Everything you touch turns to gold, gold, gold
Everything, everything
Everything you touch turns to gold, gold

[Post-Chorus]
Gold

[Verse 1]
One more day we'll spend together
Let your eyes look up upon me for the better
Oh, I know I'm worse for weather
But, my love, I won't give up
Spend my days cursing my soul
Wishing I could paint my scars and make me whole
Oh, I know I could be better
But, my love, I won't give up

[Pre-Chorus]
I ain't no Superman, I ain't no Holy Ghost
I'm just the one that keeps you up at night, you love the most
I'll be your strong man, I'll be your West Coast
I'll be the sun, I'll be the waves, I'll be the one you love the most

[Chorus]
Ooh, hey, hey, hey, oh
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
I'll be, I'll be, I'll be, I'll be, I'll be your West Coast, honey
Ooh, hey, hey, hey, oh
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
I'll be, I'll be, I'll be, I'll be, I'll be your West Coast, honey
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

[Verse 2]
I'll change my ways if you would stay
And all your tears that you have cried will go away
Oh, just grant me one more day
Oh, my love, please don't give up
See the Devil at my door
I see the future of the ones that I've ignored
I guess I was born to be at war
And, my love, I won't give up
So, my love, please don't give up

[Pre-Chorus]
I ain't no Superman, I ain't no Holy Ghost
I'm just the one who keeps you up at night, you love the most
I'll be your strong man, I'll be your West Coast
I'll be the sun, I'll be the waves, I'll be the one you love the most

[Chorus]
Ooh, hey, hey, hey, oh
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
I'll be, I'll be, I'll be, I'll be, I'll be your West Coast, honey
Ooh, hey, hey, hey, oh
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
I'll be, I'll be, I'll be, I'll be, I'll be your West Coast, honey

[Outro]
Ooh, hey, hey, hey 
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
I'll be, I'll be, I'll be, I'll be, I'll be your West Coast, honey 
Ooh, hey, hey, hey 
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
I'll be, I'll be, I'll be, I'll be, I'll be your West Coast, honey 

[Intro]
Here's to my future
Here's to my yesterday
Here's to change
Oh, here's to my yesterday
No tomorrow without a yesterday
Here's to my future
Goodbye to yesterday

[Verse 1]
All these years, I've been searching
For who I'm supposed to be
All this time I've been wasting
'Cause I was right in front of me

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, it's a crooked old tradition
By a masterful magician
But in all this trouble I've met
I haven't got one single regret, no

[Chorus]
Here's to my future
Here's to my yesterday
Here's to change
Oh, here's to my yesterday
No tomorrow without a yesterday
Here's to my future
Goodbye to yesterday
Yesterday

[Verse 2]
Oh, I'm a hopeless crash collision
'Cause I'm a hostage to my pride
And by my own volition
I've been a saint, I've been the truth, I've been the lie

[Pre-Chorus]
It's a crooked old tradition
By a masterful magician
But in all this trouble I've met
I haven't got one single regret, no

[Chorus]
Here's to my future
Here's to my yesterday
Here's to change
Oh, here's to my yesterday
No tomorrow without a yesterday
Here's to my future
Goodbye to yesterday
Yesterday

[Bridge]
A new day, you can go
You can do anything you wanna
It's your play, swing low
Go high, anywhere you wanna
You can reach for the moon
Anywhere your dreams could take you
Go astray, fade away
Just leave it to yesterday

[Chorus]
Here's to my future
Here's to my yesterday
Here's to change
Oh, here's to my yesterday
No tomorrow without a yesterday
Here's to my future
Goodbye to yesterday
Yesterday

[Verse 1]
Get down with the victim
We both know you need them
You're stuck in the middle
Of all irrelevance
And your heart is beating
'Cause you know that you gotta
Get out of the middle
And rise to the top now

[Pre-Chorus]
When you've made it
Won't ya tell me what to do?
'Cause I'm playin' it all wrong
When you made it 
Won't ya tell me what to do?
'Cause I'm playin' it all wrong

[Chorus]
You can't fight the friction, so 
You can't take the pressure, so 
Don't tell me to be strong 
You can't fight the friction
So ease it off

[Verse 2]
And get into the system
We both know you need one
The tip of the needle
Is taking over you
And your heart is beating
'Cause you know that you gotta
Get out of the middle
And rise to the top now

[Pre-Chorus]
When you've made it
Won't ya tell me what to do?
'Cause I'm playin' it all wrong
When you made it 
Won't ya tell me what to do?
'Cause I'm playin' it all wrong

[Chorus]
You can't fight the friction, so 
You can't take the pressure, so 
Don't tell me to be strong 
You can't fight the friction
So, ease it off

[Bridge]
Ooh
Why can't you let go?
Like a bird in the snow
This is no place to build your home

[Outro]
You can't fight the friction, so 
You can't take the pressure, so 
Don't tell me to be strong 
You can't fight the friction, so
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse 1]
How many lies do we have to tell?
To keep from saying, that I wish you well?
How many times I said I'm movin on?
How many times that false alarm goes off? 
Goes off? 
I know I'll see you tomorrow

[Chorus]
'Cause Im bad at lettin' you go, lettin' you go
Lettin' you go, lettin' you go
Moving on, moving on, moving on, moving on
I'm ready to go, ready to go
I'm ready to throw, ready to throw
You're my boomerang, boomerang
Youre my boomerang, boomerang

[Verse 2]
How many tears do we have to cry?
How many sleepless, lonely nights?
To work it out, is it worth it now?
Should we go ahead?
Or should we turn around?
I know Ill see you tomorrow

[Chorus]
'Cause Im bad at lettin' you go, lettin' you go
Lettin' you go, lettin you go
Moving on, moving on, moving on, moving on
I'm ready to go, ready to go
I'm ready to throw, ready to throw
You're my boomerang, boomerang
You're my boomerang, boomerang

[Bridge]
Just because it isn't easy doesn't mean that it is wrong
Everything that we've been working on, working on so long
Ooh, ooh, ooh

[Outro]
You're my boomerang, boomerang 
You're my boomerang, boomerang
You're my boomerang, boomerang
You're my boome-boome-boomerang-rang
Lettin' you go, lettin' you go 
Lettin' you go, lettin' you go 
Moving on, moving on 
Moving on, moving on 
Ready to go, ready to go 
I'm ready to throw, ready to throw
You're my boomerang, boomerang
You're my boomerang, boomerang
Lettin' you go, lettin' you go 
Lettin' you go, lettin' you go 
Moving on, moving on

Oh, the mouth of the river

Oh, the mouth of the river

[Verse 1]
I wanna live a life like that
Live the life of the faithful one
Wanna bow to the floor
With everybody else wanna be someone
I wanna make some love
I don't want no enemies
Oh, it's the curse of the man
Always living life, living life, living just to please

And I'm pacing, oh, I'm pacing

[Chorus]
Oh, the mouth of the river

Cool out, cool out

[Verse 1]
Just before I go
Yes, I know that I'm losing control and
I want to take things slow
Put my mind in cruise control
I know I'm always pacing
And I blame it on the pressure I'm facing
I wanna take things slow
Put my mind in cruise control

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm standing on your front porch saying, "Don't go"
You were lookin' at me wild saying, "Just go home," and

[Chorus]
Cool out, 'cause baby, I don't think I'm the one for you
So just cool out, 'cause baby, I don't think I'm the one for you
So cool out, stay high, stay fresh, play nice
And just cool out, 'cause baby, I don't think I'm the one for you
So cool out

[Verse 2]
You're always saying that you read my sign and
Always wishing that I take the time but
You know that's not my speed
Only believe what I can see
I live my life in black-and-white
I know that's not what you would like
That's all I know
I put my mind in cruise control

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm standing on your front porch saying, "Don't go"
You were lookin' at me wild saying, "Just go home," and

[Chorus]
Cool out, 'cause baby, I don't think I'm the one for you
So just cool out, 'cause baby, I don't think I'm the one for you
So cool out, stay high, stay fresh, play nice
And just cool out, 'cause baby, I don't think I'm the one for you
So cool out 
So cool out 

[Bridge]
All the things that you detest in me
They keep you coming back for more, you see
We make each other get a bit crazy
But you will always be a part of me

[Chorus]
Cool out, 'cause baby, I don't think I'm the one for you
So just cool out, 'cause baby, I don't think I'm the one for you
So cool out, stay high, stay fresh, play nice
And just cool out, 'cause baby, I don't think I'm the one for you
So cool out

[Outro]
So cool out 
Cool out 
So cool out

The Roman king, the Romulus
The precipice, born to change
The final days, the last embrace
Augustus, Nero, taking names

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm high, then I'm low, low
Stop, then I go, go
Bipolar, oh, oh
Yes, then I'm no, no
My time will come, I promise that
Pull the trigger back, back

[Chorus]
Bullet in a gun 
But in the end, my time will come
Like a bullet in a gun
Blood, sweat, and tears to be the one
Bullet in a gun , gun , gun 
Gun , gun , gun , gun 
Bullet in a gun , gun , gun 
Gun , gun , gun , gun 
Bullet in a gun

[Verse 2]
To make a name, you pay the price
You give your life, no other way
The devil's deal, it comes around
To wear the crown, rise up from the ground

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm high, then I'm low, low
Stop, then I go, go
Bipolar, oh, oh
Yes, then I'm no, no
My time will come, I promise that
Pull the trigger back, back

Bullet in a gun 
But in the end, my time will come
Like a bullet in a gun
Blood, sweat, and tears to be the one
Bullet in a gun , gun , gun 
Gun , gun , gun , gun 
Bullet in a gun , gun , gun 
Gun , gun , gun , gun 
Bullet in a gun

[Bridge]
How many voices go unheard?
How many lessons never learned?
How many artists fear the light?
Fear the pain, go insane?
Lose your mind, lose yourself

Sellout, sellout, sellout

[Chorus]
Bullet in a gun 
Gun , gun , gun 
But in the end, my time will come
Gun , gun , gun 
Like a bullet in a gun
Gun , gun , gun 
Gun , gun , gun 
Blood, sweat, and tears to be the one
Bullet in a gun , gun , gun 
Gun , gun , gun , gun

[Verse 1]
Clenched teeth, no words
All this distance taking its toll
Speaking volumes
Silence screaming over your words

[Pre-Chorus]
I never did you right, I know that
Too many sleepless nights, I own that
I said it time and time, I know that
I wanna try again

[Chorus]
Can we start over?
Can we start over?
Can we start over
Before it's over, over?

[Verse 2]
Cold nights, cold sheets
One more lonely empty hotel room
What I'd give to
Find my way back into you

[Pre-Chorus]
I never did you right, and I know that
Too many sleepless nights, I own that
I said it time and time, I know that
I wanna try again

[Chorus]
Can we start over?
Can we start over?
Can we start over
Before it's over, over?
Can we start over?
Can we get closer?
Can we start over
Before it's over, over?

[Bridge]
Come alive, come alive, come alive again
Come alive, come alive, come alive again
Come alive, come alive, come alive again
Come alive, come alive, come alive again

[Outro]
Can we start, can we start over?
Can we start over?
Can we start over
Before it's over, over?
Can we start over?

Can we get closer?

Can we start over

Before it's over, over?
[Verse 1]
Found you when your heart was broke
I filled your cup until it overflowed
Took it so far to keep you close 
I was afraid to leave you on your own 

[Pre-Chorus]
I said I'd catch you if you fall 
And if they laugh, then fuck 'em all 
And then I got you off your knees
Put you right back on your feet
Just so you could take advantage of me

[Chorus]
Tell me, how's it feel sittin' up there?
Feelin' so high, but too far away to hold me
You know I'm the one who put you up there
Name in the sky, does it ever get lonely?
Thinkin' you could live without me
Thinkin' you could live without me
Baby, I'm the one who put you up there
I don't know why 
Thinkin' you could live without me
Live without me
Baby, I'm the one who put you up there
I don't know why 

[Verse 2]
Gave love 'bout a hundred tries 
Just runnin' from the demons in your mind
Then I took yours and made 'em mine 
I didn't notice 'cause my love was blind

[Pre-Chorus]
Said I'd catch you if you fall 
And if they laugh, then fuck 'em all 
And then I got you off your knees
Put you right back on your feet
Just so you could take advantage of me

[Chorus]
Tell me, how's it feel sittin' up there?
Feelin' so high, but too far away to hold me
You know I'm the one who put you up there
Name in the sky, does it ever get lonely?
Thinkin' you could live without me
Thinkin' you could live without me
Baby, I'm the one who put you up there
I don't know why 
Thinkin' you could live without me
Live without me
Baby, I'm the one who put you up there
I don't know why, yeah

[Bridge]
You don't have to say just what you did 
I already know 
I had to go and find out from them 
So tell me, how's it feel? 

[Chorus]
Tell me, how's it feel sittin' up there?
Feelin' so high, but too far away to hold me
You know I'm the one who put you up there
Name in the sky, does it ever get lonely?
Thinkin' you could live without me
Thinkin' you could live without me
Baby, I'm the one who put you up there
I don't know why 

[Verse 1]
Your little brother never tells you but he loves you so
You said your mother only smiled on her TV show
You're only happy when your sorry head is filled with dope
I'll hope you make it to the day you're 28 years old

[Pre-Chorus]
You're drippin' like a saturated sunrise
You're spilling like an overflowin' sink
You're ripped at every edge but you're a masterpiece
And now you're tearin' through the pages and the ink

[Chorus]
Everything is blue
His pills, his hands, his jeans
And now I'm covered in the colors
Pull apart at the seams
And it's blue
And it's blue
Everything is gray
His hair, his smoke, his dreams
And now he's so devoid of color
He don't know what it means
And he's blue
And he's blue

[Verse 2]
You were a vision in the morning when the light came through
I know I've only felt religion when I've lied with you
He said, "You'll never be forgiven 'til your boys are too"
And I'm still waking every morning but it's not with you

[Pre-Chorus]
You're drippin' like a saturated sunrise
You're spilling like an overflowin' sink
You're ripped at every edge but you're a masterpiece
And now you're tearin' through the pages and the ink

[Chorus]
Everything is blue
His pills, his hands, his jeans
And now I'm covered in the colors
Pull apart at the seams
And it's blue
And it's blue
Everything is gray
His hair, his smoke, his dreams
And now he's so devoid of color
He don't know what it means
And he's blue
And he's blue

[Bridge]
You were red, and you liked me because I was blue
But you touched me, and suddenly I was a lilac sky
Then you decided purple just wasn't for you

[Chorus]
Everything is blue
His pills, his hands, his jeans
And now I'm covered in the colors
Pull apart at the seams
And it's blue
And it's blue
Everything is gray
His hair, his smoke, his dreams
And now he's so devoid of color
He don't know what it means
And he's blue
And he's blue

[Outro]
Everything is blue
Everything is blue
Everything is blue
Everything is blue

[Verse 1]
Got a boy back home in Michigan
And he tastes like Jack when I'm kissing him
So I told him that I never really liked his friends
Now he's gone and he's calling me a bitch again
There's a guy that lives in the garden state
And he told me that we'd make it 'til we graduate
So I told him that the music would be worth the wait
But he wants me in the kitchen with a dinner plate

[Pre-Chorus]
I believe, I believe, I believe, I believe that we're meant to be
But jealousy, jealousy, jealousy, jealousy get the best of me
Look, I don't mean to frustrate, but I
Always make the same mistakes, yeah
Always make the same mistakes 'cause

[Chorus]
I'm bad at love 
But you can't blame me for tryin'
You know I'd be lyin' sayin'
You were the one 
That could finally fix me
Lookin' at my history
I'm bad at love

[Verse 2]
Got a girl with California eyes
And I thought that she could really be the one this time
But I never got the chance to make her mine
Because she fell in love with little thin white lines
London girl with an attitude
We never told no one, but we look so cute
Both got way better things to do
But I always think about it when I'm riding through

[Pre-Chorus]
I believe, I believe, I believe, I believe that I'm in too deep
And jealousy, jealousy, jealousy, jealousy get the best in me
Look, I don't mean to frustrate, but I
Always make the same mistakes, yeah
Always make the same mistakes 'cause

[Chorus]
I'm bad at love 
But you can't blame me for tryin'
You know I'd be lyin' sayin'
You were the one 
That could finally fix me
Lookin' at my history
I'm bad at love

[Post-Chorus]
Oh, you know, you know, you know, you know
I'm bad at love 
I'm bad at love 

[Bridge]
I know that you're afraid I'm gonna walk away
Each time the feeling fades
Each time the feeling fades
I know that you're afraid I'm gonna walk away
Each time the feeling fades

[Chorus]
You know I'm bad at love 
But you can't blame me for tryin'
You know I'd be lyin' sayin'
You were the one 
That could finally fix me
Lookin' at my history
I'm bad at love 

[Post-Chorus]
Oh, you know, you know, you know, you know
I'm bad at love 
Oh, oh

[Intro]
Now I lay me down to sleep
I pray the Lord, my soul to keep
If I shall die before I wake
I pray the Lord, my soul to take

[Chorus]
I, I keep a record of the wreckage in my life
I gotta recognize the weapon in my mind
They talk shit, but I love it every time
And I realize

[Verse 1]
I've tasted blood and it is sweet
I've had the rug pulled beneath my feet
I've trusted lies and trusted men
Broke down and put myself back together again
Stared in the mirror and punched it to shatters
Collected the pieces and picked out a dagger
I've pinched my skin in between my two fingers
And wished I could cut some parts off with some scissors

[Pre-Chorus]
"Come on, little lady, give us a smile"
No, I ain't got nothin' to smile about
I got no one to smile for, I waited a while for
A moment to say I don't owe you a goddamn thing

[Chorus]
I, I keep a record of the wreckage in my life
I gotta recognize the weapon in my mind
They talk shit, but I love it every time
And I realize

[Post-Chorus]
I'm no sweet dream, but I'm a hell of a night
That I'm no sweet dream, but I'm a hell of a night

[Verse 2]
No, I won't smile, but I'll show you my teeth
And I'ma let you speak if you just let me breathe
I've been polite, but won't be caught dead
Lettin' a man tell me what I should do with my bed
Keep my exes in check in my basement
'Cause kindness is weakness, or worse, you're complacent
I could play nice or I could be a bully
I'm tired and angry, but somebody should be

[Pre-Chorus]
"Come on, little lady, give us a smile"
No, I ain't got nothin' to smile about
I got no one to smile for, I waited a while for
A moment to say I don't owe you a goddamn thing

[Chorus]
I, I keep a record of the wreckage in my life
I gotta recognize the weapon in my mind
They talk shit, but I love it every time
And I realize
I, I keep a record of the wreckage in my life
I gotta recognize the weapon in my mind
They talk shit, but I love it every time
And I realize

[Bridge]
Someone like me can be a real nightmare, completely aware
But I'd rather be a real nightmare, than die unaware, yeah
Someone like me can be a real nightmare, completely aware
But I'm glad to be a real nightmare, so save me your prayers

[Chorus]
I, I keep a record of the wreckage in my life
I gotta recognize the weapon in my mind
They talk shit, but I love it every time
And I realize
I, I keep a record of the wreckage in my life
I gotta recognize the weapon in my mind
They talk shit, but I love it every time
And I realize

[Post-Chorus]
I'm no sweet dream, but I'm a hell of a night
That I'm no sweet dream, but I'm a hell of a night

[Verse 1]
I've missed your calls for months it seems
Don't realize how mean I can be
'Cause I can sometimes treat the people
That I love like jewelry
'Cause I can change my mind each day
I didn't mean to try you on
But I still know your birthday
And your mother's favorite song

[Chorus]
So I'm sorry to my unknown lover
Sorry that I can't believe
That anybody ever really
Starts to fall in love with me
Sorry to my unknown lover
Sorry I could be so blind
Didn't mean to leave you
And all of the things that we had behind
Ooh ooh oooh

[Verse 2]
I run away when things are good
And never really understood
The way you laid your eyes on me
In ways that no one ever could
And so it seems I broke your heart
My ignorance has struck again
I failed to see it from the start
And tore you open 'til the end

[Chorus]
And I'm sorry to my unknown lover
Sorry that I can't believe
That anybody ever really
Starts to fall in love with me
Sorry to my unknown lover
Sorry I could be so blind
Didn't mean to leave you
And all of the things that we had behind

[Bridge]
And someone will love you
Someone will love you
Someone will love you
But someone isn't me
Someone will love you
Someone will love you
Someone will love you
But someone isn't me

[Chorus]
Sorry to my unknown lover
Sorry that I can't believe
That anybody ever really
Starts to fall in love with me
Sorry to my unknown lover
Sorry I could be so blind
Didn't mean to leave you
And all of the things that we had behind

[Outro]
And someone will love you
Someone will love you
Someone will love you
But someone isn't me
And someone will love you
Someone will love you
Someone will love you
But someone isn't me

[Verse 1]
I wanna start this out and say
I gotta get it off my chest 
Gotnoanger, got nomalice
Just a little bit of regret
Know nobody else will tell you
So there's some things I gotta say
Gonna jot it down and then get it out
And then I'll be on my way

[Pre-Chorus]
No, you're not half the man you think that you are
And you can't fill the hole inside of you with money, drugs, and cars
I'm so glad I never ever had a baby with you
'Cause you can't love nothing unless there's something in it for you

[Chorus]
Oh, I feel so sorry, I feel so sad
I tried to help you, it just made you mad
And I had no warning about who you are
I'm just glad I made it out without breaking down
And then ran so fucking far
That you would never ever touch me again
Won't see your alligator tears
'Cause know I've had enough of them

[Verse 2]
I'm gonna start this out by saying 
I really meant well from the start
Take a broken man right in my hands
And then put back all his parts

[Pre-Chorus]
But you're not half the man you think that you are
And you can't fill the hole inside of you with money, girls, and cars
I'm so glad I never ever had a baby with you
'Cause you can't love nothing unless there's something in it for you

[Chorus]
Oh, I feel so sorry 
I feel so sad 
I tried to help you 
It just made you mad
And I had no warning 
About who you are 
Just glad I made it out without breaking down
Oh, I feel so sorry 
I feel so sad 
I tried to help you 
It just made you mad
And I had no warning 
About who you are 
'Bout who you are

[Bridge]
Hey-ey-ey-ey, yeah
Hey-ey-ey-ey, yeah
Hey-ey-ey-ey, yeah
Hey-ey-ey-ey, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause you're not half the man you think that you are
And you can't fill the hole inside of you with money, drugs, and cars
I'm so glad I never ever had a baby with you
'Cause you can't love nothing unless there's something in it for you

[Outro]
I feel so sad
You should be sad
You should be
You should be sad
You should be
You should be
You should be

[Verse 1]
Are you insane like me? Been in pain like me?
Bought a hundred dollar bottle of champagne like me?
Just to pour that motherfucker down the drain like me?
Would you use your water bill to dry the stain like me?
Are you high enough without the Mary Jane like me?
Do you tear yourself apart to entertain like me?
Do the people whisper bout you on the train like me?
Saying that "you shouldn't waste your pretty face" like me?

[Chorus]
And all the people say
"You can't wake up, this is not a dream
You're part of a machine, you are not a human being
With your face all made up, living on a screen
Low on self esteem, so you run on gasoline"

[Post-Chorus]

I think theres a flaw in my code

These voices wont leave me alone
Well my heart is gold and my hands are cold

[Verse 2]
Are you deranged like me? Are you strange like me?
Lighting matches just to swallow up the flame like me?
Do you call yourself a fucking hurricane like me?
Pointing fingers cause you'll never take the blame like me?

[Chorus]
And all the people say
"You can't wake up, this is not a dream
You're part of a machine, you are not a human being
With your face all made up, living on a screen
Low on self esteem, so you run on gasoline"

[Post-Chorus]

I think theres a flaw in my code

These voices wont leave me alone
Well my heart is gold and my hands are cold

[Intro]
If I
If I

[Verse 1]
Said he tried to phone me, but I never have time
He said that I never listen, but I don't even try
I got a new place in Cali, but I'm gone every night
So I fill it with strangers so they keep on the lights
She said she told you she knows me, but the face isn't right
She asked if I recognized her and I told her I might

[Pre-Chorus]
See, everywhere I go
I got a million different people tryna kick it
But I'm still alone in my mind, yeah

[Chorus]
I know you're dying to meet me
But I can just tell you this
Baby, as soon as you meet me
You'll wish that you never did


[Verse 2]
I stayed a night out in Paris where they don't know my name
And I got into some trouble with that drink in my veins
I got a problem with parties 'cause it's loud in my brain
And I can never say sorry 'cause I won't take the blame
I know I always go missing and you're lying awake
But if you ask why I'm distant, oh, I'm running away

[Pre-Chorus]
You know that everywhere I go
I got a million different people tryna kick it
But I'm still alone in my mind

[Chorus]
I know you're dying to meet me
But I can just tell you this
Baby, as soon as you meet me
You'll wish that you never did


[Bridge]
I, I know you wanna
I, I know you wanna
I, I know you wanna
Slip under my armor
I, I know you wanna
I, I know you wanna
I, I know you wanna
Slip under my armor

[Pre-Chorus]
See, everywhere I go, I got a million different people tryna hit it
But I'm still alone in my mind

[Chorus]
I know you're dying to meet me
But I can just tell you this
Baby, as soon as you meet me
You'll wish that you never did

Yeah

[Outro]

You'll wish that you never did

Oh 
You'll wish that you never did[Music Video Prologue]

[Verse 1]
Cigarettes and tiny liquor bottles
Just what youd expect inside her new Balenciaga
Viral mess, turned dreams into an empire
Self-made success, now she rolls with Rockefellers

[Pre-Chorus]
Survival of the richest, the citys ours until the fall
They're Monaco and Hamptons bound
But we dont feel like outsiders at all

[Chorus]
We are the new Americana
High on legal marijuana 
Raised on Biggie and Nirvana
We are the new Americana

[Verse 2]
Young James Dean, some say he looks just like his father
But he could never love somebodys daughter
Football team loved more than just the game
So he vowed to be his husband at the altar

[Pre-Chorus]
Survival of the richest, the citys ours until the fall
They're Monaco and Hamptons bound
But we dont feel like outsiders at all

[Chorus]
We are the new Americana
High on legal marijuana 
Raised on Biggie and Nirvana
We are the new Americana

[Bridge]
We know very well who we are
So we hold it down when summer starts
What kind of dough have you been spending?
What kind of bubblegum have you been blowing lately?

[Chorus]
We are the new Americana
High on legal marijuana 
Raised on Biggie and Nirvana
We are the new Americana

We are the new Americana
High on legal marijuana 
Raised on Biggie and Nirvana
We are the new Americana

[Verse 1]
It's crazy when
The thing you love the most is the detriment
Let that sink in
You canthinkagain
When the handyou wanna hold is a weaponand
You're nothin' but skin

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, 'cause I keep diggin' myself down deeper
I won't stop 'til I get where you are
I keep running, I keep running, I keep running

[Chorus]
They say I may be making a mistake
I woulda followed all the way, no matter how far
I know when you go down all your darkest roads
I woulda followed all the way to the graveyard
Oh, 'cause I keep diggin' myself down deeper
I won't stop 'til I get where you are
I keep running when both my feet hurt
I won't stop 'til I get where you are
Oh, when you go down all your darkest roads
I woulda followed all the way to the graveyard 

[Verse 2]
You look at me 
With eyes so dark, don't know how you even see
You push right through me 
It's gettin' real
You lock the door, you're drunk at the steering wheel
And I can't conceal

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, 'cause I've been diggin' myself down deeper
I won't stop 'til I get where you are
I keep running, I keep running, I keep running

[Chorus]
They say I may be making a mistake
I woulda followed all the way, no matter how far
I know when you go down all your darkest roads
I woulda followed all the way to the graveyard
Oh, 'cause I keep diggin' myself down deeper
I won't stop 'til I get where you are
I keep running when both my feet hurt
I won't stop 'til I get where you are
Oh, when you go down all your darkest roads
I woulda followed all the way to the graveyard

[Bridge]
Oh, it's funny how
The warning signs can feel like they're butterflies

[Chorus]
Oh, 'cause I keep diggin' myself down deeper
I won't stop 'til I get where you are
I keep running when both my feet hurt
I won't stop 'til I get where you are
Oh, when you go down all your darkest roads
I woulda followed all the way to the graveyard

[Verse 1]
I don't wanna fight right now
Know you always right, now

But nobody waitin' 'round with me
Been through the ups
Yeah the ups and the downs with me
Got a whole lot of love
But you don't wanna spread it 'round with me, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
Never pick up, never call me

[Verse 2]
I'm turnin' off the light right now
I'm callin' it a night now
Wishin' you were 'round with me
But you're in a different town than me
We've been through it all
But you could never spit it out for me
Tryna talk to a wall
But you could never tear it down for me, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
Never pick up, never call me
You know we're runnin' out of time
Never pick up when you want me
Now I gotta draw a line

[Verse 1]
Your eyes, so crisp, so green
Sour apple baby, but you taste so sweet
You got hipslikeJagger and twoleft feet
And I wonder if you'dlike to meet
Your voice is velvet through a telephone
You can come to mine, but both my roommates are home
Think I know a bar where they would leave us alone
And I wonder if you'd take it slow

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, we're dancin' in my living room, and up come my fists
And I say I'm only playing, but the truth is this
That I've never seen a mouth that I would kill to kiss
And I'm terrified, but I can't resist
And I said

[Chorus]
Beautiful stranger, here you are in my arms and I know
That beautiful strangers only come along to do me wrong
And I hope, beautiful stranger, here you are in my arms
But I think it's finally, finally, finally, finally, finally safe
For me to fall

[Post-Chorus]
Oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh

[Verse 2]
I grab your hand and then we run to the car
Singing in the street and playing air guitar
Stuck between my teeth just like a candy bar
And I wonder if it goes too far to say
I've never recognized a purer face
You stopped me in my tracks and put me right in my place
Used to think that loving meant a painful chase
But you're right here now and I think you'll stay

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, we're dancin' in my living room, and up come my fists
And I say I'm only playing, but the truth is this
I've never seen a mouth that I would kill to kiss
And I'm terrified, but the truth is this
I said

[Chorus]
Beautiful stranger, here you are in my arms and I know
That beautiful strangers only come along to do me wrong
And I hope, beautiful stranger, here you are in my arms
And I think it's finally, finally, finally, finally, finally safe
For me to fall

[Post-Chorus]
Oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh
Yeah, I think it's finally, finally, finally, finally

[Verse 1: Halsey]
She doesn't kiss me on the mouth anymore
'Cause it's more intimate, than she thinks we should get
She doesn't look me in the eyes anymore
Too scared of what she'll see, somebody holding me

[Pre-Chorus: Halsey]
When I wake up all alone
And I'm thinking of your skin
I remember, I remember what you told me

[Chorus 1: Halsey & Lauren Jauregui]
Said that we're not lovers, we're just strangers
With the same damn hunger
To be touched, to be loved, to feel anything at all
We're not lovers, we're just strangers
With the same damn hunger
To be touched, to be loved, to feel anything at all

[Verse 2: Lauren Jauregui]
She doesn't call me on the phone anymore
She's never listening, she says it's innocent
She doesn't let me have control anymore
I must've crossed a line, I must've lost my mind

[Pre-Chorus: Halsey]
When I wake up all alone
And I'm thinking of your skin
I remember, I remember what you told me

[Chorus 1: Halsey & Lauren Jauregui]
Said that we're not lovers, we're just strangers
With the same damn hunger
To be touched, to be loved, to feel anything at all
We're not lovers, we're just strangers
With the same damn hunger
To be touched, to be loved, to feel anything at all

[Bridge: Halsey, Lauren Jauregui & both]
I miss the mornings with you laying in my bed
I miss the memories replaying in my head
I miss the thought of a forever, you and me
But all you're missing is my body, oh

[Chorus 2: Halsey, Lauren Jauregui & both]
Said we're not lovers 
'Cause we're just strangers
With the same damn hunger
To be touched, to be loved, to feel anything at all
We're not lovers, we're just strangers
With the same damn hunger
To be touched, to be loved, to feel anything at all 

[Outro: Halsey, Both]
To feel anything at all
To feel anything at all


[Verse 1]
I, I know where to lay
I know what to say
It's all the same
And I, I know how to play
I know this game
It's all the same

[Chorus]
Now if I keep my eyes closed, he looks just like you
But he'll never stay, they never do
Now if I keep my eyes closed, he feels just like you
But you've been replaced
I'm face to face with someone new

[Verse 2]
Would've gave it all for you, cared for you
So tell me where I went wrong
Would've gave it all for you, cared for you

Would've traded all for you, there for you
So tell me how to move on
Would've traded all for you, cared for you


[Chorus]
Now if I keep my eyes closed, he looks just like you
But he'll never stay, they never do
Now if I keep my eyes closed, he feels just like you
But you've been replaced
I'm face to face with someone new

[Bridge]
He don't realize that I'm thinkin' about you
It's nothing new, it's nothing new

[Chorus]
Now if I keep my eyes closed, he looks just like you
But he'll never stay, they never do
Now if I keep my eyes closed, he feels just like you
But you've been replaced
I'm face to face with someone new

[Verse 1]
My demons are begging me to open up my mouth
I need them
Mechanically make the words come out
They fight me, vigorous and angry
Watch them pounce
Ignite me
Licking up the flames they bring about

[Pre-Chorus]
I sold my soul to a three-piece
And he told me I was holy
Hes got me down on both knees
But its the devil that's tryna...

[Chorus]
Hold me down, hold me down
Sneaking out the back door, make no sound
Knock me out, knock me out
Saying that I want more, this is what I live for
Hold me down, hold me down
Throw me in the deep end, watch me drown
Knock me out, knock me out
Saying that I want more, this is what I live for

[Verse 2]
Selfish
Taking what I want, and call it mine
Im helpless
Clinging to a little bit of spine
They rush me
Telling me Im running out of time
They shush me 
Walking me across a fragile line

[Pre-Chorus]
I sold my soul to a three-piece
And he told me I was holy
Hes got me down on both knees
But its the devil that's tryna...

[Chorus]
Hold me down, hold me down
Sneaking out the back door, make no sound
Knock me out, knock me out
Saying that I want more, this is what I live for
Hold me down, hold me down
Throw me in the deep end, watch me drown
Knock me out, knock me out
Saying that I want more, this is what I live for

[Bridge]
Hold me down now
Hold me down now
Hold me do-o-o-o-own

[Pre-Chorus]
I sold my soul to a three-piece
And he told me I was holy
Hes got me down on both knees
But its the devil that's tryna...

[Chorus]
Hold me down, hold me down
Sneaking out the back door, make no sound
Knock me out, knock me out
Saying that I want more, this is what I live for
Hold me down, hold me down
Throw me in the deep end, watch me drown
Knock me out, knock me out
Saying that I want more, this is what I live for

[Verse 1]
They sent me away to find them a fortune
A chest filled with diamonds and gold
The house was awake, with shadows and monsters
The hallways, they echoed and groaned

I sat alone, in bed till the morning
I'm crying, "They're coming for me"
And I tried to hold these secrets inside me
My mind's like a deadly disease

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm bigger than my body
I'm colder than this home
I'm meaner than my demons
I'm bigger than these bones

[Chorus]
And all the kids cried out, "Please stop, you're scaring me"
I can't help this awful energy
God damn right, you should be scared of me
Who is in control?

[Verse 2]
I paced around for hours on empty
I jumped at the slightest of sounds
And I couldn't stand the person inside me
I turned all the mirrors around

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm bigger than my body
I'm colder than this home
I'm meaner than my demons
I'm bigger than these bones

[Chorus]
And all the kids cried out, "Please stop, you're scaring me"
I can't help this awful energy
God damn right, you should be scared of me
Who is in control?

[Bridge]
I'm well acquainted with villains that live in my bed
They beg me to write them so they'll never die when I'm dead
And I've grown familiar with villains that live in my head
They beg me to write them so I'll never die when I'm dead

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm bigger than my body
I'm colder than this home
I'm meaner than my demons
I'm bigger than these bones

[Chorus]
And all the kids cried out, "Please stop, you're scaring me"
I can't help this awful energy
God damn right, you should be scared of me
Who is in control?
And all the kids cried out, "Please stop, you're scaring me"
I can't help this awful energy
God damn right, you should be scared of me
Who is in control?

[Verse 1]
Sick of all these people talking, sick of all this noise
Tired of all these cameras flashing, sick of being poised
Now my neck is open wide, begging for a fist around it
Already choking on my pride, so there's no use crying about it

[Pre-Chorus]
Agnus dei
Agnus dei
Agnus dei
Agnus dei

[Chorus]
I'm headed straight for the castle
They wanna make me their queen
And there's a old man sitting on the throne there saying that I probably shouldn't be so mean
I'm headed straight for the castle
Theyve got the Kingdom locked up
And there's the old man sitting on the throne there saying I should probably keep my pretty mouth shut
Straight for the castle

[Verse 2]
Oh, all these minutes passing, sick of feeling used
If you wanna break these walls down, youre gonna get bruised
Now my neck is open wide, begging for a fist around it
Already choking on my pride, so there's no use crying about it
Crying about it
Crying about it
Crying about it, about it, bout it, bout it

[Chorus]
I'm headed straight for the castle
They wanna make me their queen
And there's an old man sitting on the throne saying that I probably shouldn't be so mean
I'm headed straight for the castle
Theyve got the Kingdom locked up
And there's a old man sitting on the throne there saying I should probably keep my pretty mouth shut
Straight for the castle

[Bridge]
There's no use crying about it
There's no use crying about it
There's no use crying about it
There's no use crying about it

[Chorus]
I'm headed straight for the castle
They wanna make me their queen
And there's the old man sitting on the throne there that's saying that I probably shouldn't be so mean
I'm headed straight for the castle
Theyve got the Kingdom locked up
And there's the old man sitting on the throne there saying I should probably keep my pretty mouth shut
Straight for the castle
They wanna make me their queen
And there's a old man sitting on the throne there saying that I probably shouldn't be so mean
I'm headed straight for the castle
Theyve got the Kingdom locked up
And there's an old man sitting on the throne there saying I should probably keep my pretty mouth shut
Straight for the castle

[Intro]
I'm searching for something that I can't reach

[Verse 1]
I don't like them innocent, I don't want no face fresh
Want them wearing leather, begging, let me be your taste test
I like the sad eyes, bad guys, mouth full of white lies
Kiss me in the corridor, but quick to tell me goodbye

[Pre-Chorus]
You say that you're no good for me
'Cause I'm always tugging at your sleeve
And I swear I hate you when you leave
But I like it anyway

[Chorus]
My ghost, where'd you go?
I can't find you in the body sleeping next to me
My ghost, where'd you go?
What happened to the soul that you used to be?

[Verse 2]
You're a Rolling Stone boy, never-sleep-alone boy
Got a million numbers and they're filling up your phone, boy
I'm off the deep end, sleeping all night through the weekend
Saying that I love him but I know I'm gonna leave him

[Pre-Chorus]
You say that you're no good for me
'Cause I'm always tugging at your sleeve
And I swear I hate you when you leave
But I like it anyway

[Chorus]
My ghost, where'd you go?
I can't find you in the body sleeping next to me
My ghost, where'd you go?
What happened to the soul that you used to be?

[Bridge]
I'm searching for something that I can't reach

[Chorus]
My ghost, where'd you go?
I can't find you in the body sleeping next to me
My ghost, where'd you go?
What happened to the soul that you used to be?

[Verse 1]
There's a place way down in Bed Stuy
Where a boy lives behind bricks
He's got an eye for girls of eighteen
And he turns them out like tricks
I went down to a place in Bed Stuy
A little liquor on my lips
I let him climb inside my body
And held him captive in my kiss

[Pre-Chorus]
And there's a storm you're starting now
And there's a storm you're starting now
And there's a storm you're starting

[Chorus]
I'm a wanderess, I'm a one night stand
Don't belong to no city, don't belong to no man
I'm the violence in the pouring rain
I'm a hurricane
Ha ah ah, ha ah ah, ahh
I'm a hurricane
Ha ah ah, ha ah ah, ahh
I'm a hurricane

[Verse 2]
I went down to a place in Brooklyn
Where ya tripped on LSD
And I found myself reminded
To keep you far away from me

[Pre-Chorus]
And there's a storm you're starting now
And there's a storm you're starting now
And there's a storm you're starting

[Chorus]
I'm a wanderess, I'm a one night stand
Don't belong to no city, don't belong to no man
I'm the violence in the pouring rain
I'm a hurricane
Ha ah ah, ha ah ah, ahh
I'm a hurricane
Ha ah ah, ha ah ah, ahh
I'm a hurricane

[Bridge]
He says, "Oh, baby, beggin' you to save me
Though lately, I like 'em crazy
Oh, maybe, you could devastate me
Little lady, come and fade me"

[Chorus]
I'm a wanderess, I'm a one night stand
Don't belong to no city, don't belong to no man
I'm the violence in the pouring rain
Come and fade me
Come and fade me
I'm a hurricane

[Verse 1]
Sittin' on the counter in your kitchen
Can you hear my heartbeat fucking kickin'?
Your eyes light up 'cause you best believe that I got something up my sleeve
I walk my talk, no time for wishful thinking
I push up on my toes, you call me "sweet thing"
I'm breathing down your neck, your body screaming
And you thought that you were the boss tonight, but I can put up one good fight
I flip the script like I can take a beating

[Chorus]
And when you start to feel the rush
A crimson headache, aching blush
And you surrender to the touch, you'll know
I can put on a show, I can put on a show
Don't you see what you're finding?
This is Heaven in hiding, oh
And when you start to look at me, a physical fatality
And you surrender to the heat, you'll know
I can put on a show, I can put on a show
Don't you see what you're finding?
This is Heaven in hiding
This is Heaven in hiding, oh

[Verse 2]
Sitting on the concrete in your basement
But I don't have no time for conversation
Said this ain't what you usually do, and a girl like me is new for you
And I can tell you mean it 'cause you're shaking

[Chorus]
And when you start to feel the rush
A crimson headache, aching blush
And you surrender to the touch, you'll know
I can put on a show, I can put on a show
Don't you see what you're finding?
This is Heaven in hiding, oh
And when you start to look at me, a physical fatality
And you surrender to the heat, you'll know
I can put on a show, I can put on a show
Don't you see what you're finding?
This is Heaven in hiding
This is Heaven in hiding, oh

[Bridge]
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh 
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

[Chorus]
And when you start to feel the rush
A crimson headache, aching blush
And you surrender to the touch, you'll know
I can put on a show, I can put on a show
Don't you see what you're finding?
This is Heaven in hiding, oh
And when you start to look at me, a physical fatality
And you surrender to the heat, you'll know
I can put on a show, I can put on a show
Don't you see what you're finding?
This is Heaven in hiding
This is Heaven in hiding
This is Heaven in hiding, oh

[Outro]
Oh, this is Heaven in hiding
This is Heaven in hiding
'Cause I'm Heaven in hiding

[Verse 1]
I'd like to tell you that my sky's not blue, it's violent rain
And in myworld,the people onthe street don't know my name
Inmy world, I'm seven feet tall
And the boys always call, and the girls do too
Because in my world, I'm constantly, constantly havin' a breakthrough 
Or a breakdown, or a blackout
Would you make out with me underneath the shelter of the balcony?

[Chorus]
'Cause I don't need anyone
I don't need anyone
I just need everyone and then some
I don't need anyone
I don't need anyone
I just need everyone and then some

[Verse 2]
Wish I could see what it's like to be the blood in my veins
Do the insides of all of my fingers still look the same?
And can you feel it too when I am touchin' you?
And when my hair stands on ends, it's saluting you
The blush in your cheeks says that you bleed like me
And the 808 beat sends your heart to your feet
Left my shoes in the street so you'd carry me
Through a breakdown
Through a breakdown or a blackout
Would you make out with me on the floor of the mezzanine?

[Chorus]
'Cause I don't need anyone
I don't need anyone
I just need everyone and then some
I don't need anyone
I don't need anyone
I just need everyone and then some

[Bridge]
My face is full of spiderwebs, all tender, yellow, blue
And still with one eye open, well, all I see is you
I left my daydreams at the gate because I just can't take 'em too
Know my heart still has a suitcase, but I still can't take it through

[Chorus]
I don't need anyone
I don't need anyone
I just need everyone and then some
I don't need anyone 
I don't need anyone 
I just need everyone and then some 

[Outro]
I don't need anyone
I don't need anyone
I just need everyone and then some
Oh-mmm, oh-mmm 

[Verse 1]
Well, King Midas put his hands on me again
He said one day I'd realize why I don't have any friends
I find myself alone at night unless I'm having sex
But he can make me golden if I just showed some respect

[Refrain]
But I don't let him touch me anymore
I said, "I'm not something to butter up and taste when you get bored
'Cause I have spent too many nights on dirty bathroom floors
To find some peace and quiet right behind a wooden door"

[Pre-Chorus]
He said, "Please don't go away"
He said, "Please don't go away"
I said, "It's too late"
I said, "It's too late"
He said, "Please don't go away"
He said, "Please don't go away"
I said, "It's too late"
I said, "It's too late"

[Chorus]
And now I can't stop thinking that I can't stop thinking
That I almost gave you everything
And now the whole thing's finished and I can't stop wishing
That I never gave you anything

[Verse 2]
You wrote a hundred letters just for me
And I find them in my closet in the pockets of my jeans
Now I'm constantly reminded of the time I was nineteen
Every single one's forgotten in a laundromat machine

[Refrain]
But I don't let him touch me anymore
I said, "I'm not something to butter up and taste when you get bored
'Cause I have spent too many nights on dirty bathroom floors
To find some peace and quiet right behind a wooden door"

[Pre-Chorus]
He said, "Please don't go away"
He said, "Please don't go away"
I said, "It's too late"
I said, "It's too late"
He said, "Please don't go away"
He said, "Please don't go away"
I said, "It's too late"
I said, "It's too late"

[Chorus]
And now I can't stop thinking that I can't stop thinking
That I almost gave you everything
And now the whole thing's finished and I can't stop wishing
That I never gave you anything
And I can't stop thinking that I can't stop thinking
That I almost gave you everything 
And now the whole thing's finished and I can't stop wishing
That I never gave you anything

[Outro]
He said, "Please don't go away"
He said, "Please don't go away"
I said, "It's too late"
I said, "It's too late"
He said, "Please don't go away"
He said, "Please don't go away"
I said, "It's too late"
I said, "It's too late"

[Verse 1]
My hands wrapped around a stick shift
Swerving on the 405, I can never keep my eyes off this
My neck, the feeling of your soft lips
Illuminated in the light, bouncing off the exit signs I missed

[Chorus]
All we do is drive
All we do is think about the feelings that we hide
All we do is sit in silence waiting for a sign
Sick and full of pride
All we do is drive

And California never felt like home to me
And California never felt like home
And California never felt like home to me
Until I had you on the open road and now we're singing

[Breakdown]
Ah, ah, ah-ah, ah ah ah ah
Ah, ah, ah-ah, ah ah ah
Ah, ah, ah-ah, ah ah ah ah
Ah, ah, ah-ah, ah ah ah

[Spoken Word]
Umm.. Hey, I was just wondering if you wanna like never mind. Thank you. Bye...

[Verse 2]
Your laugh echoes down the highway
Carves into my hollow chest, spreads over the emptiness
It's bliss
It's so simple but we can't stay
Over analyze again, would it really kill you if we kissed?

[Chorus]
All we do is drive
All we do is think about the feelings that we hide
All we do is sit in silence waiting for a sign
Sick and full of pride
All we do is drive

And California never felt like home to me
And California never felt like home
And California never felt like home to me
Until I had you on the open road and now we're singing

[Breakdown]
Ah, ah, ah-ah, ah ah ah ah
Ah, ah, ah-ah, ah ah
Ah, ah, ah-ah, ah ah ah ah
Ah, ah, ah-ah, ah ah ah

[Outro]

[Verse 1]
Do you remember the taste of my lips that night
I stole a bit of my mother's perfume?
'Cause I remember when my father put his fist through the wall
That separated the dining room
And I remember the fear in your eyes
The very first time we snuck into the city pool
Late December, with my heart in my chest
And the clouds of my breath
Didn't know where we were running to
But don't look back

[Chorus]
Oh, we'll be looking for sunlight, or the headlights
'Til our wide eyes burn blind
We'll be lacing the same shoes that we've worn through
To the bottom of the line
And we know that we're headstrong
And our heart's gone
And the timing's never right
But for now let's get away
On a Roman holiday

[Verse 2]
Could you imagine the taste of your lips if we never tried to kiss on the drive to Queens?
'Cause I imagine the weight of your ribs if you lied between my hips in the backseat
I imagine the tears in your eyes
The very first night I'll sleep without you
And when it happens I'll be miles away
And a few months late
Didn't know where I was running to
But I won't look back

[Chorus]
Oh, we'll be looking for sunlight, or the headlights
'Til our wide eyes burn blind
We'll be lacing the same shoes that we've worn through
To the bottom of the line
And we know that we're headstrong
And our heart's gone
And the timing's never right
So for now let's get away
On a Roman holiday

[Bridge]
Feet first, don't fall
Or we'll be running again
Keep close, stand tall

[Chorus]
Oh, we'll be looking for sunlight, or the headlights
'Til our wide eyes burn blind
We'll be lacing the same shoes that we've worn through
To the bottom of the line
And we know that we're headstrong
And our heart's gone
And the timing's never right
But for now let's get away
On a Roman holiday

[Intro]

[Verse 1]
He says, "Ooh, baby girl, you know we're gonna be legends
I'm the king and you're the queen and we will stumble through heaven
If there's a light at the end, it's just the sun in your eyes
I know you wanna go to heaven, but you're human tonight"

[Pre-Chorus]
And I've been sitting at the bottom of a swimming pool
For a while now, drowning my thoughts out with the sounds

[Chorus]
But do you feel like a young god?
You know the two of us are just young gods
And we'll be flying through the streets with the people underneath
And they're running, running, running
But do you feel like a young god?
You know the two of us are just young gods
And we'll be flying through the streets with the people underneath
And they're running, running, running
Again

[Post-Chorus]
And we'll be running, running, running
Again
And we'll be running, running, running

[Verse 2]
He says, "Ooh, baby girl, don't get cut on my edges
I'm the king of everything and oh, my tongue is a weapon
There's a light in the crack that's separating your thighs
And if you wanna go to heaven, you should fuck me tonight"

[Pre-Chorus]
And I've been sitting at the bottom of a swimming pool
For a while now, drowning my thoughts out with the sounds

[Chorus]
But do you feel like a young god?
You know the two of us are just young gods
And we'll be flying through the streets with the people underneath
And they're running, running, running
But do you feel like a young god?
You know the two of us are just young gods
And we'll be flying through the streets with the people underneath
And they're running, running, running
Again

[Post-Chorus]
And we'll be running, running, running
Again
And we'll be running, running, running

[Intro: Quavo]
Oh

[Verse 1: Halsey]
Breakfast is cold, as cold as our bed
I'm watching you choke down the words that you said
I watch you devour, mistake me for bread
Well boy, is you fed? Or are you misled?
I gave you the messiest head
You give me the messiest head
Oh, you're turnin' red
'Cause I'm tryna give the impression that I get the message you wish I was dead

[Pre-Chorus: Halsey]
See you 'bouta break a sweat 
I won't let us finish yet 
Please don't take this as a threat 
All I'm sayin' is if you don't love me no more, then

[Chorus: Halsey]
Lie, lie
Lie, lie

[Verse 2: Quavo]

I heard what you said 
You talk about your head game 
I know that it's fire flame 
Your mouth make a hurricane 
You notice that we in love 
That's something we cannot change 
It's the plans we should arrange 
Treat her right and she won't complain 
Bring back the title 
She tall like the Eiffel 
Got no one to lie to 
There's no need to lie no more 
Bring me a trial 
Every move's vital 
What you gon' die for
When everything you told lies? Alright

[Chorus: Halsey]
Lie, lie
Lie, lie
Lie, lie
Lie, lie

[Verse 1]
Been about three days and I'm comin' back
I'm about four minutes from a heart attack
And I think you make me a maniac
But you don't know, oh
Two years and we in between
But we both been here since we seventeen
Here we go, fist fight in a limousine
But they don't know

[Pre-Chorus]
And we both hope there's something
But we bo-both keep fronting
And it's a closed discussion
And I'm thinking, "Damn, if these walls could talk"

[Chorus]
 Well, they'd be like
 "Shit is crazy, right?"
 "That ain't your baby no more"

[Verse 2]
Been about two weeks since you went away
I'm about halfway through a Cabernet
There I go, I'm wastin' a Saturday, sittin' at ho-home
Told my new roommate not to let you in
But you're so damn good with a bobby pin
Now you gon' play me like a violin, hittin' these notes

[Pre-Chorus]
And we both hope there's something
But we bo-both keep fronting
And it's a closed discussion
And I'm thinking, "Damn, if these walls could talk"

[Chorus]
 Well, they'd be like
 "Shit is crazy, right?"
 "That ain't your baby no more"
 Hey
 No more
 "That ain't your baby no more"

[Verse 1: Halsey]
Standing now, in the mirror that I built myself
And I can't remember why the decisionwasn'tmine
But it seemsI'm only clingin' to an ideanow
Took my heart and sold it out to a vision that I wrote myself
And I don't wanna be somebody in America just fighting the hysteria
I only wanna die some days

[Chorus: Halsey]
Someday, someday, when I burst into flames
I'll leave you the dust, my love
Hope a bit of it'll be enough to help remember the
Days when we came to this place
I told you I'd spill my guts, I left you to clean it up
I'm bursting out of the

[Verse 2: Halsey]
Seems like now it's impossible to work this out
I'm so committed to an old ghost town
Is it really that strange if I always wanna change?
And if only the time and space between us wasn't lonely
I'd disintegrate into a thousand pieces
Think I'm makin' a mistake, but if I decide to break
Who will fill the empty space? So...

[Chorus: Halsey]
Now, if I figure this out
Apart from my beating heart
It's a muscle, but it's still not strong enough to carry the
Weight of the choices I've made
I told you I'd ride this out
It's gettin' harder every day
Somehow, I'm burstin' out of myself

[Outro: Halsey & Kate Winslet]


Too many guys think I'm a concept, or
I complete them, or I'm gonna make them alive
I'm just a fucked up girl who's lookin' for my own peace of mind
Don't assign me yours

[Verse 1]
Alone out in Saint-Tropez
Lookin' as fine as a damn Monet
Tryna hydrate on Perrier
Everybody thirsty, drinks on me
When I'm out, clothes on lay away
Tryna take back what you say to me
I don't give a damn what you say to me
There ain't no time for games with me

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm moving on, I'm getting paid
I'm on my own, I had some space to deal with it
I'm moving on, it's getting late
Go and grab someone and find a place to deal with it

[Chorus]
Yeah, don't even try
Can't fuck up my vibe
Double cuppin' in the ride
Motherfucker, don't play with me

[Post-Chorus]
Motherfucker, don't play with me
Motherfucker, don't play with me
Motherfucker, don't play with me

[Verse 2]
Runnin' lines like a marathon
Got it all white like parmesan
I am not the type to be out past dawn
Tomorrow got a flight headed to Taiwan
Now you know where the bottle gone
Drippin' so wet with the Prignon
I am not the type to admit I'm on
How could I lie when we sip so strong?

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm moving on, I'm getting paid
I'm on my own, I had some space to deal with it
I'm moving on, it's getting late
Go and grab someone and find a place to deal with it

[Chorus]
Yeah, don't even try
Can't fuck up my vibe
Double cuppin' in the ride
Motherfucker, don't play with me

[Post-Chorus]
Motherfucker, don't play with me
Motherfucker, don't play with me
Motherfucker, don't play with me

[Outro]
Play, play, play, play
Play, play, play, play
Play, play, play, play
Play, play, play, play
Play, play, play, play
Play, play, play, play
Play, play, play, play
Women, don't play no games
Play, play, play, play
Women, don't play no games
Play, play, play, play
Women, don't play no games
Play, play, play, play
Women, don't play no games
Play, play, play, play
Women, don't play no games
Play, play, play, play
Women, don't play no games

[Intro]
I really was born at 9:29 AM on 9/29
You think I'm lying, but I'm, I'mbeingdead serious 
Okay, I'llprove it

[Verse]
Well, who am I? I'm almost 25
Can't remember half the time that I've been alive
'Cause half was in a cheap apartment
And half was on the Eastside 
They said don't meet your heroes, they're all fuckin' weirdos
And God knows that they were right
Because nobody loves you, they just try to fuck you
Then put you on a feature on the B-Side
And who do you call when it's late at night?
When the headlines just don't paint the picture right
When you look at yourself on a screen and say
"Oh my God, there's no way that's me"
And I, I quit smoking, well recently, I tried
And I bought another house, and I never go outside
And I remember this girl with pink hair in Detroit
Well, she told me
She said, "Ashley, you gotta promise us that you won't die
'Cause we need you," and honestly, I think that she lied
And I remember the names of every single kid I've met
But I forget half the people who I've gotten in bed
And I've stared at the sky in Milwaukee
And hoped that my father would finally call me
And it's just these things that I'm thinkin' for hours
And I'm pickin' my hair out in clumps in the shower
Lost the love of my life to an ivory powder
But then I realize that I'm no higher power
That I wasn't in love then, and I'm still not now
And I'm so happy I figured that out
I've got a long way to go until self-preservation
Think my moral compass is on a vacation
And I can't believe I still feed my fucking temptation
I'm still looking for my salvation

[Chorus]
Soft and slow, watch the minutes go
Count out loud, so we know you don't keep 'em for yourself
Watch the minutes go
Count out loud, so we know you don't keep 'em for yourself

[Interlude]
I think I have a confession to make, I feel like 
I need to say that I was really born at 9:26
It's on my birth certificate, I'm a liar
Man, I'm a fucking liar

[Outro]
Soft and slow, watch the minutes go
Count out loud, so we know you don't keep 'em for yourself

[Verse 1]
Darling, I've just left the bar
And I've misplaced all my credit cards
My self-preservation and allofmy reservations
Are sittin'and contemplating what to do withme, do with me
Think I took it way too far
And I'm stumblin' drunk, getting in a car
My insecurities are hurtin' me
Someone please come and flirt with me
I really need a mirror that'll come along and tell me that I'm fine
I do it every time

[Pre-Chorus]
I keep on hanging on the line, ignoring every warning sign
Come on and make me feel alright again

[Chorus]
'Cause it's 3 AM
And I'm callin' everybody that I know
And here we go again
While I'm runnin' through the numbers in my phone
And yeah, I'll take fake moans and dial tones
Let 'em spill right down the microphone
I need it digital 'cause, baby, when it's physical
I end up alone, end up alone

[Post-Chorus]
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
I need it digital 'cause, baby, when it's physical
I end up alone, end up alone

[Verse 2]
And every night, I wanna live in color through a white-blue screen
I got a technicolor vision going vivid in my white-blue jeans
I know it's complicated
'Cause everyone that I've dated says they hate it
'Cause they don't know what to do with me, do with me
Know that my identity's always getting the best of me
I'm the worst of my enemies
And I don't really know what to do with me
Yeah, I don't really know what to do with me

[Pre-Chorus]
I keep on hanging on the line, ignoring every warning sign
Come on and make me feel alright again

[Chorus]
'Cause it's 3 AM
And I'm callin' everybody that I know
And here we go again
While I'm runnin' through the numbers in my phone
And yeah, I'll take fake moans and dial tones
Let 'em spill right down the microphone
I need it digital 'cause, baby, when it's physical
I end up alone, end up alone

[Post-Chorus]
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
I need it digital 'cause, baby, when it's physical
I end up alone, end up alone

[Bridge]
I'm reckless, treat it like a necklace
Take a different version and I try it on for size with everybody that I know
And will you please pick up the fucking phone?

[Chorus]
'Cause it's 3 AM
And I'm callin' everybody that I know
And here we go again
While I'm runnin' through the numbers in my phone
And yeah, I'll take fake moans and dial tones
Let 'em spill right down the microphone
I need it digital 'cause, baby, when it's physical
I end up alone, end up alone

[Post-Chorus]
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
I need it digital 'cause, baby, when it's physical
I end up alone

[Outro: John Mayer]
Your, your best song is a song that's currently on the radio
How many people can say that?
That their best song is the one that's currently about to be a massive hit?
It's already a hit, it's just gonna get more massive
How many people can say it? Not very many
Congratulations!

[Verse 1]
Everybody wants to know
If we fucked on the bathroom sink
How your hands felt in my hair
If we were high on amphetamines

And everybody wants to hear
How we chain-smoked until three
And how you laughed when you said my name
And how you gripped my hips so mean

[Pre-Chorus]
We wrote a story in the fog on the windows that night
But the ending is the same every damn time, no, no, no
We wrote a story in the fog on the windows that night
But the ending is the same every damn time

[Chorus]
They think I'm insane, they think my lover is strange
But I don't have to fucking tell them anything, anything
And I'm gonna write it all down, and I'm gonna sing it on stage
But I don't have to fucking tell you anything, anything

[Post-Chorus]
That's the beauty of a secret
You know you're supposed to keep it
That's the beauty of a secret
Oh, wa-oh, wa-oh, wa-oh, wa-oh
That's the beauty of a secret
You know you're supposed to keep it
But I don't have to fucking tell you anything, anything

[Verse 2]
Everybody's waiting up to hear if I dare speak your name
Put it deep beneath the track, like the hole you left in me
And everybody wants to know 'bout how it felt to hear you scream
They know you walk like you're a God, they can't believe I made you weak

[Pre-Chorus]
We wrote a story in the fog on the windows that night
But the ending is the same every damn time, no, no, no
We wrote a story in the fog on the windows that night
But the ending is the same every damn time

[Chorus]
They think I'm insane, they think my lover is strange
But I don't have to fucking tell them anything, anything
And I'm gonna write it all down, and I'm gonna sing it on stage
But I don't have to fucking tell you anything, anything

[Post-Chorus]
That's the beauty of a secret
You know you're supposed to keep it
That's the beauty of a secret
Oh, wa-oh, wa-oh, wa-oh, wa-oh
That's the beauty of a secret
You know you're supposed to keep it
But I don't have to fucking tell you anything, anything

[Bridge]
These days I can't seem to get along with anyone
Get by with anyone
These days I can't seem to make this right
Well, is this fine? Will it be alright?

[Chorus]
They think I'm insane, they think my lover is strange
But I don't have to fucking tell them anything, anything
And I'm gonna write it all down, and I'm gonna sing it on stage
But I don't have to fucking tell you anything, anything

[Post-Chorus]
That's the beauty of a secret
You know you're supposed to keep it
That's the beauty of a secret
Oh, wa-oh, wa-oh, wa-oh, wa-oh
That's the beauty of a secret
You know you're supposed to keep it
But I don't have to fucking tell you anything, anything

[Verse 1: Halsey]
Boy, you make it look so easy
Promise that I'm gonna call you back in five
Sorry, baby girl, but I can't tonight, oh
Boy, you make it look so simple, mm
Yeah, I've known that girl for like my whole life
Back in my hotel and I'm alone inside, oh

[Pre-Chorus: Halsey]
'Cause you know the truth hurts, but secrets kill
Can't help thinkin' that I love it still
Still here, there must be something real
'Cause you know the good die young, but so did this
And so it must be better than I think it is
Gimme those eyes, it's easy to forgive

[Chorus]
Oh-oh-oh
Oh-ooh
Oh-oh-oh
Oh-ooh
Oh-ooh
Oh-ooh
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-ooh

[Verse 2: Halsey]
You and all your friends all hate me, oh
Thinkin' that you're better when I'm not around
Hear me on the radio and turn it down, oh
I can't help the way you made me
Hope that she believin' in the truth you found
Thinkin' that you want us 'cause I can't find out, oh

[Pre-Chorus: Halsey]
'Cause you know the truth hurts, but secrets kill
Can't help thinkin' that I love it still
Still here, there must be something real
'Cause you know the good die young
But so did this, and so it must be better than I think it is
Gimme those eyes, it's easy to forgive

[Chorus: Halsey]
Oh-oh-oh
Oh-ooh
Oh-oh-oh
I hope hopeless
Oh-ooh
Changes over time
Oh-ooh
I hope hopeless
Oh-ooh
Changes over time
Oh-ooh
I hope hopeless
Oh-ooh
Changes over time

[Verse 1]
I found god
I found him in a lover
When his hair falls in his face
And his hands so cold they shake

I found the devil
I found him in a lover
And his lips like tangerines
In his color-coded speak

[Pre-Chorus]
Now we're lost somewhere in outer space
In a hotel room where demons play
They run around beneath our feet
We roll around beneath these sheets

[Chorus]
I've got a lover, a love like religion
I'm such a fool for sacrifice
He's coming down, down, coming down
It's coming down, down, coming down

I've got a lover and I'm unforgiven
I'm such a fool to pay this price
It's coming down, down, coming down
It's coming down, down, coming down

[Verse 2]
I found a martyr
He told me that I'd never
With his educated eyes
And his head between my thighs

I found a savior
I don't think he remembers
Cause he's off to pay his crimes
And he's got no time for mine

[Pre-Chorus]
Now we're lost somewhere in outer space
In a hotel room where demons play
They run around beneath our feet
We roll around beneath these sheets

[Chorus]
I've got a lover, a love like religion
I'm such a fool for sacrifice
He's coming down, down, coming down
It's coming down, down, coming down

I've got a lover and I'm unforgiven
I'm such a fool to pay this price
It's coming down, down, coming down
It's coming down, down, coming down

Every single night pray the sun will rise
Every single time make a compromise
Every single night pray the sun will rise, but
It's coming down, down, coming down
He's coming down, down, coming down

[Chorus]
I've got a lover, a love like religion
I'm such a fool for sacrifice
He's coming down, down, coming down
It's coming down, down, coming down

I've got a lover and I'm unforgiven
I'm such a fool to pay this price
It's coming down, down, coming down
It's coming down, down, coming down

[Bridge]
Every single night pray the sun will rise
Every single time make a compromise
Every single night pray the sun will rise, but
It's coming down, down, coming down
He's coming down, down, coming down

[Outro]
It's coming down, down, coming down
He's coming down, down, coming down
It's coming down, down, coming down
He's coming down, down, coming down
It's coming down, down, coming down
He's coming down, down, coming down

X, X, X

[Intro: Juice WRLD]
Ah-all I ever wanted

[Verse 1: Halsey]
Found you when your heart was broke
I filled your cup until it overflowed
Took it so far to keep you close 
I was afraid to leave you on your own

[Pre-Chorus: Halsey, Halsey & Juice WRLD]
I said I'd catch you if you fall 
And if they laugh, then fuck em all 
And then I got you off your knees
Put you right back on your feet
Just so you could take advantage of me

[Chorus: Halsey]
Tell me, how's it feel sittin' up there?
Feelin so high, but too far away to hold me
You know I'm the one who put you up there
Name in the sky, does it ever get lonely?
Thinking you could live without me
Thinking you could live without me
Baby, I'm the one who put you up there
I don't know why 
Thinking you could live without me
Live without me
Baby, I'm the one who put you up there
I don't know why 

[Verse 2: Halsey]
Gave love bout a hundred tries 
Just running from the demons in your mind
Then I took yours and made em mine 
I didn't notice cause my love was blind

[Pre-Chorus: Halsey, Halsey & Juice WRLD]
I said I'd catch you if you fall 
And if they laugh, then fuck 'em all 
And then I got you off your knees
Put you right back on your feet
Just so you could take advantage of me

[Chorus: Halsey, Halsey & Juice WRLD]
Tell me, how's it feel sittin up there?
Feelin' so high but too far away to hold me
You know I'm the one who put you up there
Name in the sky, does it ever get lonely?
Thinking you could live without me
Thinking you could live without me
Baby, I'm the one who put you up there
I don't know why 
Thinking you could live without me
Live without me
Baby, I'm the one who put you up there
I don't know why, yeah

[Verse 3: Juice WRLD]
I'm sad inside, but I know it's for the best, right?
You had to realize where you drew the line
I would cross the line a thousand times
You've got what I need, bae, I need your spotlight
Along the lines of social suicide, I refuse to die not by your side
So I'll take what I can from you, then I'll hide
And save the "Lucid Dreams" for another time
I still hate it when you're not there
I know I should, I know I should, but no, I don't care
I still hate it when you're not there
This life's not fair, took advantage of that

[Chorus: Halsey, Juice WRLD, & Both]
Tell me, how's it feel sittin' up there? 
Feelin' so high, but too far away to hold me 
You know I'm the one who put you up there 
Name in the sky, does it ever get lonely? 
Thinking you could live without me
Thinking you could live without me
Baby, I'm the one who put you up there
I don't know why

[Intro]
Oh, oh
Yeah

[Verse 1]
I should be living the dream
But I'm livin' with a security team
And that ain'tgonnachange, no
I gota paranoia in me
And you wouldn'tbelieve
Everything that I seen, no
Comin' apart at the seams
And no one around me knows

[Pre-Chorus]
Who I am, what I'm on
Who I've hurt and where they've gone
I know that I've done some wrong
But I'm tryna make it right
To the one I love, bring me 'round
Get me out right now 
And know that I love you

[Chorus]
But I'm still learning to love myself

I'm still learning to love myself
 Yeah, yeah

[Verse 2]
I should be living the dream
But I go home and I got no self-esteem 
You think I'm swimmin' in green
But it's passed around my family tree
No man wants to really commit
Intimidated 'cause I get paid and shit
In the crowd, you're readin' my lips
But no one around me knows

[Pre-Chorus]
Who I am, what I'm on
Who I've hurt and where they've gone
I know that I've done some wrong
But I'm tryna make it right
The same mistakes on and on
To all my friends, I'm sorry for
And know that I love you

[Chorus]
But I'm still learning  to love myself
 Yeah, yeah
I'm still learning  to love myself 
 Yeah, yeah 
Oh, I try and I try to remember sometimes
If I breathe, it's alright, but some things don't change
I'm still learning  to love myself 
 Yeah, yeah

[Bridge]
Who I am, what I'm on
Who I've hurt and where they've gone
I know that I've done some wrong
But I'm tryna make it right
To the one I love, bring me 'round
Get me out right now 
And the ones I love

[Chorus]
I'm still learning to love myself
 Yeah, yeah
I'm still learning  to love myself 

And I try and I try to remember sometimes
If I breathe, it's alright, but some things don't change
I'm still learning  to love myself 
To love myself, tryna love myself

[Outro]
I'm still learning to love myself

[Intro: Amanda Seyfried & Megan Fox]
You're killing people
No, I'm killing boys
Boys are just placeholders, they come and they go
You're mybestfriend, and Iwanna help you
But I won't letyou kill again
That's a lose-lose

[Verse 1: Halsey]
Told me pick my battles and be pickin' 'em wise
But I wanna pick 'em all and I don't wanna decide
No more, no more, anymore
So we'll sneak in in the back and then we'll kick in the door
Tell me, have you ever keyed a Ferrari before?
Oh no, I don't anymore

[Chorus: Halsey]
And I'm not breakin', I won't take it
And I won't ever feel this way again
'Cause you don't need me anymore, woah
And I won't ever try again
And all I want in return is revenge
'Cause I don't need you anymore, woah
So where do you go?

[Verse 2: Halsey]
Pull up to the drive and I remember the codes
Yeah, the only fuckin' numbers you don't hide in your phone
No more, no more, anymore
Climb up to the window and I'm breakin' the glass
Then I stop, 'cause I don't wanna Uma Thurman your ass
No more, no more, anymore

[Chorus: Halsey]
And I'm not breakin', I won't take it
And I won't ever feel this way again
'Cause you don't need me anymore, woah
And I won't ever try again
And all I want in return is revenge
'Cause I don't need you anymore, woah
So where do you go?

[Outro: Halsey]
Woah, woah, woah, oh, oh
When I don't need you anymore
Woah, woah, woah, oh, oh
And I don't need you

[Verse 1]
I woke up to another mess in the living room
Broken bottles all around my feet
They came again in the night under crescent moon
Didn't wake me in my sleep

[Pre-Chorus 1]
'Cause they talk and drink and laugh 'bout things
And fall in love in my backyard
I hide and cower in the corner
Conversation's getting hard
'Cause nobody seems to ask about me anymore
And nobody seems to care 'bout anything I think
And nobody seems to recognize me in the crowd
In the background screaming, "Everybody, look at me"

[Chorus]
And I'm fading away, you know, I used to be on fire
And I'm fading away, you know, I used to be on fire
I'm standing in the ashes of who I used to be
And I'm fading away, you know, I used to be on fire
You know, I used to be on fire
You know, I used to be on fire, fire

[Verse 2]
I used to be a darling starlet like a centerpiece
Had the whole world wrapped around my ring
I flew too closely to the sun that's setting in the East
And now I'm melting from my wings

[Pre-Chorus 2]
'Cause I'd laugh and drink and talk 'bout things
And fall in love in my backyard
Now its my own anxiety
That makes the conversation hard
'Cause nobody seems to ask about me anymore
And nobody ever cares 'bout anything I think
And nobody seems to recognize me in the crowd
In the background screaming, "Everybody, look at me"

[Chorus]
And I'm fading away, you know, I used to be on fire
And I'm fading away, you know, I used to be on fire
I'm standing in the ashes of who I used to be
But I'm fading away, you know, I used to be on fire
You know, I used to be on fire
You know, I used to be on fire
Well, I used to be on fire
You know, I used to be on fire

[Outro]
You know, I used to be on fire
You know, I used to be on fire, fire

[Verse 1]
You said I would've hit the ceiling
You said I
You said I should eat my feelings
Head held high

[Pre-Chorus]
I won't take anyone down if I crawl tonight
But I still let everyone down when I change in size
And I went tumbling down tryna reach your high
But I scream too loud if I speak my mind

[Chorus]
I don't wanna wake it up
I don't wanna wake it up
I don't wanna wake it up
The devil in me
I don't wanna wake it up
I don't wanna wake it up
I don't wanna wake it up
The devil in me

[Post-Chorus]
Gotta wake up, gotta wake up
Gotta wake up, gotta wake up
Gotta wake up
Come back to life
Gotta wake up, gotta wake up
Gotta wake up, gotta wake up
Gotta wake up
Come back to life

[Verse 2]
You said I'm too much to handle
You said I
Shine too bright, I burnt the candle
Flew too high

[Pre-Chorus]
I won't take anyone down if I crawl tonight
But I still let everyone down when I change in size
And I went tumbling down tryna reach your high
But I scream too loud when I speak my mind

[Chorus]
I don't wanna wake it up
I don't wanna wake it up
I don't wanna wake it up
The devil in me
I don't wanna wake it up
I don't wanna wake it up
I don't wanna wake it up
The devil in me

[Post-Chorus]
Gotta wake up, gotta wake up
Gotta wake up, gotta wake up
Gotta wake up
Come back to life
Gotta wake up, gotta wake up
Gotta wake up, gotta wake up
Gotta wake up
Come back to life

[Interlude]

[Chorus]
Now I gotta wake it up
Now I gotta wake it up
Now I gotta wake it up
The devil in me
Now I gotta wake it up
Now I gotta wake it up
Now I gotta wake it up
The devil in me

[Post-Chorus]
Gotta wake up, gotta wake up
Gotta wake up, gotta wake up
Gotta wake up
Come back to life
Gotta wake up, gotta wake up
Gotta wake up, gotta wake up
Gotta wake up
Come back to life

[Verse 1]
You were dancing in your tube socks in our hotel room
Flashing those eyes like highway signs
Light one up and hand it over, rest your head upon my shoulder
I just wanna feel your lips against my skin

[Verse 2]
White sheets, bright lights, crooked teeth, and the nightlife
You told me this is right where it begins
But your lips hang heavy underneath me
And I promised myself I wouldnt let you complete me

[Verse 3]
Im trying not to let it show, that I dont want to let this go
Is there somewhere you can meet me?
Cause I clutched your arms like stairway railings
And you clutched my brain and eased my ailing

[Verse 4]
Youre writing lines about me, romantic poetry
Your girl's got red in her cheeks
Cause were something she cant see
And I try to refrain but youre stuck in my brain
All I do is cry and complain, because seconds not the same

[Outro]
Im sorry but I fell in love tonight
I didn't mean to fall in love tonight
Youre looking like you fell in love tonight
Could we pretend that were in love?
Im sorry but I fell in love tonight
I didn't mean to fall in love tonight
Youre looking like you fell in love tonight
Could we pretend that were in love?

[Verse 1]
You promised the world and I fell for it
I put you first and you adoredit
Setfires to myforest
And you let it burn
Sang off-keyin my chorus
'Cause it wasn't yours
I saw the signs and I ignored it
Rose-colored glasses all distorted
Set fire to my purpose
And I let it burn
You got off on the hurtin'
When it wasn't yours, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
We'd always go into it blindly
I needed to lose you to find me
This dancing was killing me softly
I needed to hate you to love me, yeah

[Chorus]
To love, love, yeah
To love, love, yeah
To love, yeah
I needed to lose you to love me, yeah
To love, love, yeah
To love, love, yeah
To love, yeah
I needed to lose you to love me

[Verse 2]
I gave my all and they all know it
Then you tore me down and now it's showing
In two months, you replaced us
Like it was easy
Made me think I deserved it
In the thick of healing, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
We'd always go into it blindly
I needed to lose you to find me
This dancing was killing me softly
I needed to hate you to love me, yeah

[Chorus]
To love, love, yeah
To love, love, yeah
To love, yeah
I needed to lose you to love me, yeah
To love, love, yeah
To love, love, yeah
To love, yeah
I needed to lose you to love me

[Bridge]
You promised the world and I fell for it
I put you first and you adored it
Set fires to my forest
And you let it burn
Sang off-key in my chorus

[Chorus]
To love, love, yeah
To love, love, yeah
To love, yeah
I needed to hate you to love me, yeah
To love, love, yeah
To love, love, yeah
To love, yeah
I needed to lose you to love me
To love, love, yeah
To love, love, yeah
To love, yeah

[Outro]
And now the chapter is closed and done
To love, love, yeah
To love, love, yeah
To love, yeah
And now it's goodbye, it's goodbye for us

[Verse 1]
Took you like a shot
Thought that I could chase you with a cold evenin'
Let a couple years water down how Im feelin' about you

And every time we talk
Every single word builds up to this moment
And I gotta convince myself I dont want it
Even though I do 

[Pre-Chorus]
You could break my heart in two
But when it heals, it beats for you
I know it's forward, but it's true

[Chorus]
I wanna hold you when I'm not supposed to
When I'm lyin' close to someone else
You're stuck in my head and I can't get you out of it
If I could do it all again, I know Id go back to you

[Post-Chorus]
I know Id go back to you, oh
I know I'd go back to you

[Verse 2]
We never got it right
Playin and replayin' old conversations
Overthinkin' every word and I hate it
'Cause its not me 
And what's the point in hidin'?
Everybody knows, we got unfinished business
And I'll regret it if I didn't say
This isn't what it could be 

[Pre-Chorus]
You could break my heart in two
But when it heals, it beats for you
I know it's forward, but it's true

[Chorus]
I wanna hold you when I'm not supposed to
When I'm lyin' close to someone else
You're stuck in my head and I can't get you out of it
If I could do it all again, I know I'd go back to you

[Post-Chorus]
I know I'd go back to you
I know I'd go back to you
I'd go back to you
I'd go back to you
I know I said I wasn't sure
But I'd go back to you
I know I'd go back to you

[Bridge]
You can break my heart in two
But when it heals, it beats for you
I know it's forward, but it's true
Won't lie, I'd go back to you
You know, my thoughts are runnin' loose
It's just a thing you make me do
And I could fight, but what's the use?
I know I'd go back to you

[Chorus]
I wanna hold you when I'm not supposed to
When I'm lyin' close to someone else
You're stuck in my head and I can't get you out of it
If I could do it all again, I know I'd go back to you

[Post-Chorus]
I'll go back to you
I'll go back to you
I know I'd go back to you
I'd go back to you, I'd go back to you
I know I'd go back to you


[Verse 1: Selena Gomez]
Take it or leave it
Baby take it or leave it
But I know you won't leave it
'Cause I know that you need it
Look in the mirror
When I look in the mirror
Baby I see it clearer
Why you wanna be nearer

[Pre-Chorus: Selena Gomez]
I'm not surprised
I sympathize, ah
I can't deny
Your appetite, ah

[Chorus: Selena Gomez]
You got a fetish for my love
I push you out and you come right back
Don't see a point in blaming you
If I were you, I'd do me too
You got a fetish for my love
I push you out and you come right back
Don't see a point in blaming you
If I were you, I'd do me too
You got a fetish for my love

[Verse 2: Selena Gomez]
Reaching your limit
Say you're reaching your limit
Going over your limit
But I know you can't quit it
Something about me
Got you hooked on my body
Take you over and under and twisted up like origami

[Pre-Chorus: Selena Gomez]
I'm not surprised
I sympathize, ah
I can't deny
Your appetite, ah

[Chorus: Selena Gomez]
You got a fetish for my love
I push you out and you come right back
Don't see a point in blaming you
If I were you, I'd do me too
You got a fetish for my love
I push you out and you come right back
Don't see a point in blaming you
If I were you, I'd do me too
You got a fetish for my love

[Verse 3: Gucci Mane]
It's Gucci!
The way you walk, the way you talk
I blame you 'cause it's all your fault
You're playin' hard, don't turn me off
You actin' hard, but I know you soft
You my fetish, I'm so with it
All these rumors bein' spreaded
Might as well go 'head and whip it
'Cause they sayin' we already did it
Call on Gucci if you ever need me
I'll be South Beach in the drop top gleamin'
Water diamonds, Aquafina
Just need you in a blue bikini

[Chorus: Selena Gomez]
You got a fetish for my love
I push you out and you come right back
Don't see a point in blaming you
If I were you, I'd do me too
You got a fetish for my love
I push you out and you come right back
Don't see a point in blaming you
If I were you, I'd do me too
You got a fetish for my love

[Verse 1]
I was walking down the street the other day
Tryna distract myself
But then I see your face
Oh wait, that's someone else
Tryna play it coy
Tryna make it disappear
But just like the battle of Troy
There's nothing subtle here
In my room there's a king size space
Bigger than it used to be
If you want you can rent that place
Call me an amenity
Even if it's in my dreams

[Pre-Chorus]
Ooh you're taking up a fraction of my mind
Ooooh every time I watch you serpentine

[Chorus]
Oh I'm tryin', I'm tryin', I'm tryin'
I'm tryin', I'm tryin'
Oh tryin', I'm tryin', I'm tryin'
I'm tryin', I'm tryin'
Not to think about you
No, no, no, no
Not to think about you

Oh I'm tryin', I'm tryin', I'm tryin'
I'm tryin', I'm tryin'
Oh tryin', I'm tryin', I'm tryin'
I'm tryin', I'm tryin'
Not to give in to you
No, no, no, no
Not to give in to you
No, no, no, no

[Post-Chorus]
With my feelings on fire
Guess I'm a bad liar

[Verse 2]
I see how your attention builds
It's like looking in a mirror
Your touch like a happy pill
But still all we do is fear
What could possibly happen next?
Can we focus on the love?
Paint my kiss across your chest
If you're the art, I'll be the brush

[Pre-Chorus]
Ooh you're taking up a fraction of my mind
Ooooh every time I watch you serpentine

[Chorus]
Oh I'm tryin', I'm tryin', I'm tryin'
I'm tryin', I'm tryin'
Oh tryin', I'm tryin', I'm tryin'
I'm tryin', I'm tryin'
Not to think about you
No, no, no, no
Not to think about you
No, no, no, no
Oh I'm tryin', I'm tryin', I'm tryin'
I'm tryin', I'm tryin'
Oh tryin', I'm tryin', I'm tryin'
I'm tryin', I'm tryin'
Not to give in to you
No, no, no, no
Not to give in to you
No, no, no, no

[Post-Chorus]
With my feelings on fire
Guess I'm a bad liar

[Bridge]
And oh baby let's make reality, actuality, a reality
Oh baby let's make reality, actuality, a reality

[Chorus]
Oh, oh, I'm tryin', I'm tryin', I'm tryin'
I'm tryin', I'm tryin'

[Intro]
Yeah

[Verse 1]
They fell in love one summer
A little too wild for each other
Shiny 'til it wasn't
Feelsgood'til it doesn't
Itwas her first real lover
His too'til he had another
Oh, God, when she found out
Trust levels went way down

[Pre-Chorus]
Of course she was sad
But now she's glad she dodged a bullet 
Took a few years to soak up the tears
But look at her now, watch her go

[Chorus]
Mm-mm-mm, mm-mm-mm, mm-mm
Look at her now, watch her go
Mm-mm-mm, mm-mm-mm, mm-mm
Wow, look at her now

Look at her now, watch her go
Mm-mm-mm, mm-mm-mm, mm-mm
Wow, look at her now

[Post-Chorus]
Wow, look at her now

[Verse 2]
Fast nights that got him
That new life was his problem
Not saying she was perfect
Still regrets that moment
Like that night
Wasn't wrong, wasn't right, yeah
What a thing to be human 
Made her more of a woman 

[Pre-Chorus]
Of course she was sad
But now she's glad she dodged a bullet 
Took a few years to soak up the tears
But look at her now, watch her go

[Chorus]
Mm-mm-mm, mm-mm-mm, mm-mm
Look at her now, watch her go
Mm-mm-mm, mm-mm-mm, mm-mm
Wow, look at her now

She knows she'll find love 
Only if she wants it
She knows she'll find love 
She knows she'll find love 
Only if she wants it
She knows she'll find love 
On the up from the way down
Look at her now, watch her go

[Outro]
Mm-mm, look at her now, mm-mm 
She knows she'll find love 
Only if she wants it
She knows she'll find love
Look at her now, yeah 
She knows she'll find love 
Only if she wants it
She knows she'll find love
Wow, look at her now[Produced by Hit-Boy, Nick Monson, & Rock Mafia]

[Verse 1: Selena Gomez]
I'm on my 14 carats
I'm 14 carat
Doing it up like Midas
Now you say I got a touch
So good, so good
Make you never wanna leave
So don't, so don't

[Pre-Chorus: Selena Gomez]
Gonna wear that dress you like, skin-tight
Do my hair up real, real nice
And syncopate my skin to your heart beating

[Chorus: Selena Gomez]
Cause I just wanna look good for you, good for you
I just wanna look good for you, good for you
Let me show you how proud I am to be yours
Leave this dress a mess on the floor
And still look good for you, good for you

[Verse 2: Selena Gomez]
I'm on my marquise diamonds
I'm a marquise diamond
Could even make that Tiffany jealous
You say I give it to you hard
So bad, so bad
Make you never wanna leave
I won't, I won't

[Pre-Chorus: Selena Gomez]
Gonna wear that dress you like, skin-tight
Do my hair up real, real nice

[Bridge: Selena Gomez]
Trust me, I can take you there
Trust me, I can take you there
Trust me, I, trust me, I, trust me, I

[Verse 3: A$AP Rocky]
Hold on, take a minute, love
Cause I ain't trying to fuck your image up
Like we mess around in triple cuffs
Stumble 'round town, pull your zipper up
Pants sag like I don't give a
I ain't trying to fuck your business up
And I ain't trying to get you into stuff
But the way you touchin' on me in the club
Rubbin' on my miniature
John Hancock, fuck the signature
Any time I hit it, know she finna fall through
And every time we get up, always end up on the news
Ain't worried bout no press and ain't worried bout the next bitch
They love the way you dress and ain't got shit up on you
Jackpot, hit the jackpot
Just met a bad bitch without the ass shots
You look good, girl, you know you did good, don't you?
You look good, girl, bet it feel good, don't it?

[Chorus: Selena Gomez]
Cause I just wanna look good for you, good for you
Baby, let me be good to you, good to you
Let me show you how proud I am to be yours
Leave this dress a mess on the floor
And still look good for you, good for you

[Outro: Selena Gomez]
Trust me, I, trust me, I, trust me, I

[Intro]
What the heart wants
What the heart wants
What the heart wants 

[Verse 1]
You got me sipping on something
I can't compare to nothing I've ever known
I'm hoping that after this fever I'll survive
I know I'm acting a bit crazy
Strung out, a little bit hazy
Hand over heart, I'm praying
That I'm gonna make it out alive

[Pre-Chorus]
The bed's getting cold and you're not here
The future that we hold is so unclear
But I'm not alive until you call
And I'll bet the odds against it all
Save your advice, 'cause I won't hear
You might be right, but I don't care
There's a million reasons why I should give you up

[Chorus]
But the heart wants what it wants
The heart wants what it wants

[Verse 2]
You got me scattered in pieces
Shining like stars and screaming
Lighting me up like Venus
But then you disappear and make me wait
And every second's like torture
Heroin drip, no more so
Finding a way to let go
Baby, baby, no, I can't escape

[Pre-Chorus]
The bed's getting cold and you're not here
The future that we hold is so unclear
But I'm not alive until you call
And I'll bet the odds against it all
Save your advice, 'cause I won't hear
You might be right, but I don't care
There's a million reasons why I should give you up

[Chorus]
But the heart wants what it wants
The heart wants what it wants
The heart wants what it wants
The heart wants what it wants

[Bridge]
This is a modern fairytale
No happy endings, no wind in our sails
But I can't imagine a life without
Breathless moments
Breaking me down, down, down, down

[Pre-Chorus]
The bed's getting cold and you're not here
The future that we hold is so unclear
But I'm not alive until you call
And I'll bet the odds against it all
Save your advice, 'cause I won't hear
You might be right, but I don't care
There's a million reasons why I should give you up

[Chorus]
But the heart wants what it wants
The heart wants what it wants
The heart wants what it wants
The heart wants what it wants

[Outro]
The heart wants what it wants, baby
The heart wants what it wants, baby
It wants what it wants
It wants what it wants
The heart wants what it wants, baby
The heart wants what it wants, baby

[Verse 1]
Can't keep my hands to myself
No matter how hard I'm trying to
I want you all to myself
You're metaphorical gin and juice

So come on give me a taste
Of what its like to be next to you
Won't let one drop go to waste
You're metaphorical gin and juice

[Pre-Chorus]
Cause all of the downs and the uppers
Keep making love to each other
And I'm trying, trying, I'm trying, trying
All of the downs and the uppers
Keep making love to each other
And I'm trying, trying, I'm trying, but I

[Chorus]
Can't keep my hands to myself
My hands to myself
Can't keep my hands to myself
My hands to myself

[Verse 2]
The doctors say you're no good
But people say what they wanna say
And you should know if I could
I'd breathe you in every single day

[Pre-Chorus]
All of the downs and the uppers
Keep making love to each other
And I'm trying, trying, I'm trying, trying
All of the downs and the uppers
Keep making love to each other
And I'm trying, trying, I'm trying, but I

[Chorus]
Can't keep my hands to myself
My hands to myself
Can't keep my hands to myself
My hands to myself

[Bridge]
Can't keep my hands to myself
I want it all, no, nothing else
Can't keep my hands to myself
Give me your all and nothing else
Oh, I, I want it all
I want it all, I want it all
Can't keep my hands to myself
I mean I could, but why would I want to?

[Chorus]
My hands to myself
Can't keep my hands to myself
My hands to myself
Can't keep my hands to myself
I want it all, no, nothing else
Can't keep my hands to myself
Give me your all and nothing else
Can't keep my hands to myself

[Verse 1: Selena Gomez]
Take away your things and go
You can't take back what you said, I know
I've heard it all before, at least a million times
I'm not one to forget, you know

[Pre-Chorus 1: Selena Gomez]
I don't believe, I don't believe it
You left in peace, left me in pieces
Too hard to breathe

Im so sick of that same old love, the kind that breaks your heart
Oh-oh-oh

I'm not spending any time, wasting tonight on you
I know, I've heard it all
So don't you try and change your mind
Cause I won't be changing too, you know

You can't believe, still can't believe it
You left in peace, left me in pieces
Too hard to breathe, I'm on my knees

No one love you like I love ya
Never cheat, never lie
Never put no one above ya
I gave you space and time
Now you're telling me you miss it
And I'm still on your mind
We were one in a million
And love is hard to find

[Pre-Chorus]
Do you stay up late
Just so you don't dream?

[Chorus]
Every time your lips touch another
I want you to feel me
I want you to feel me
Every time you dance with somebody
I want you to feel me
I want you to feel me

[Post-Chorus]
Do your days get a little bit longer?
Nights get a little bit colder?
Heart beat a little bit louder?
Oh 
Days get a little bit longer? 
Nights get a little bit colder? 
Heart beat a little bit louder?
Oh

[Verse 2]
When you're running, who you run to?
Where do you go to hide?
When she ain't giving you enough to
Get you through the night
Won't be caught up in the middle
Of your highs and your lows
Baby, long as you're not with me
You'll always be alone

[Pre-Chorus]
Do you stay up late
Just so you don't dream?

Every time your lips touch another
I want you to feel me

[Verse 1]
If I give you every piece of me, I know that you could drop it
Giveyouthe chance, Iknow that you could take advantageonce you got it
If I open up my heart to you, I know that you could lock it
Throw away the key, and keep it there forever in your pocket
If I give the opportunity to you, then would you blow it?
If I was the greatest thing to happen to you, would you know it?
If my love was like a flower, would you plant it? Would you grow it?
I'ma give you all my body, are you strong enough to hold it?

[Pre-Chorus]
If I show you all my demons and we dive into the deep end
Would we crash and burn like every time before?
I would tell you all my secrets, wrap your arms around my weakness
If the only other option's letting go

[Chorus]
I'll stay vulnerable, yeah
I'll stay vulnerable, yeah
I'll stay vulnerable

[Verse 2]
If I hand you my emotions, would you even wanna take it?

If I give you all my trust, then would you fumble it and break it?

If I let you cross my finish line, then would you wanna make it?

I think I'm ready, won't you come and flip the switch and activate it? 

[Pre-Chorus]
If I show you all my demons and we dive into the deep end
Would we crash and burn like every time before?
I would tell you all my secrets, wrap your arms around my weakness
If the only other option's letting go

I'll stay vulnerable, yeah 
I'll stay vulnerable, yeah 
I'll stay vulnerable

Chills

[Verse 1]
New York back in August, tenth floor balcony
Smoke is floating over Jane and Greenwich street
Goosebumpsfromyour wild eyeswhen they're watching me
Shivers dance downmy spine, head down to my feet

[Pre-Chorus]
Swimming in your eyes, in your eyes, in your eyes
Egyptian blue
Something I've never had without you

[Chorus]
You're giving me chills at a hundred degrees
It's better than pills how you put me to sleep
Calling your name, the only language I can speak
Taking my breath, a souvenir that you can keep

[Post-Chorus]
Giving me chills
Chills

[Verse 2]
Sunset Tower lobby, waiting there for me
In the elevator, fumble for your key
Kissed in every corner, Presidential Suite
Opened that Bordeaux from 1993

[Pre-Chorus]
Swimming in your eyes, in your eyes, in your eyes
Egyptian blue
Something I've never had without you

[Chorus]
You're giving me chills at a hundred degrees
It's better than pills how you put me to sleep
Calling your name, the only language I can speak
Taking my breath, a souvenir that you can keep

The world can be a nasty place
You know it, I know it, yeah
We dont have to fall from grace
Put down the weapons you fight with

[Chorus]
Kill 'em with kindness
Kill 'em with kindness
Kill 'em, kill 'em, kill 'em with kindness
Kill 'em with kindness
Kill 'em with kindness
Go ahead, go ahead, go ahead now

[Verse 2]
Were running out of time
Chasing our lies
Everyday a small piece of you dies
Always somebody
Youre willing to fight, to be right

[Pre-Chorus]
Your lies are bullets
Your mouth's a gun
And no war in anger
Was ever won
Put out the fire before igniting
Next time youre fighting

[Chorus]
Kill 'em with kindness
Kill 'em with kindness
Kill 'em, kill 'em, kill 'em with kindness
Kill 'em with kindness
Kill 'em with kindness
Go ahead, go ahead, go ahead now

Pretty restlessly
Think I might know why 
I've been doing just fine
But baby, that don't mean
That I'm feeling anti you and me

There's a difference between a want and a need
Some nights, I just want more than me
I know that there's a fine line between
It's not what I need, but

Some nights, I just want more than me

Looking from a window above
It's like a story of love
Can you hear me?
Came back only yesterday
I'm moving farther away
Want you near me

[Chorus]
All I needed was the love you gave
All I needed for another day
And all I ever knew
Only you

[Verse 2]
Sometimes when I think of her name
When it's only a game
And I need you
Listen to the words that you say
It's getting harder to stay
When I see you

[Chorus]
All I needed was the love you gave
All I needed for another day
And all I ever knew
Only you
Only you, only you
Only you, only you

[Bridge]
This is gonna take a long time
And I wonder what's mine
Can't take no more
Wonder if you'll understand
It's just the touch of your hand
Behind a closed door

[Chorus]
And all I needed was the love you gave
All I needed for another day
And all I ever knew
Only you
All I needed was the love you gave
All I needed for another day
And all I ever knew
Only you
Only you

So many wasted 
Nights with  you 
I still can taste it 
I hate it, wish I could take it back 'cause

From people you know to people you don't
And what hurts the most is people can go
From people you know to people you don't
We used to be close, but people can go
From people you know to people you don't
And what hurts the most is people can go
From people you know to people you don't

When it was good, we were on fire
Now I'm breathin' ashes and dust
I always wanna get higher
I never know when enough is enough

So many wasted 
Nights with  you 
I still can taste it 
I hate it, wish I could take it back 'cause

Ooh, you'll really wanna know where I've been all this time
So lemme tell ya
Ooh, got two feet on the ground and felt what real is like
What it was like
Livin' out of the scene, out in the wild
Learnin' to breathe
Up in the clouds, far from the crowds
I can't believe I can be loud
Holdin' hands with the darkness and knowin' my heart is allowed
Allowed

Is there a place where I can hide away?
Red lips, french kiss my worries all away
There must be a sweeter place

So much to see, I'm in paradise, oh, I
Always seems I'm new inside
Deep, deep down in me, I go now, baby, born to fly, oh, I
Now see, how could it be?
We will find our way, we'll find the things we seek, ooh-ee
You see, I'm mesmerized
This is just for me and I am cuttin' ties, goodbye
Ooh, no, no, no, no

[Verse 1]
Different inflection when you say my name
Kiss me, but your kiss don't taste the same
Is it real or am I going out of my mind?
Curious 'bout the company that you keep
Cause I hear you talking 'bout her in your sleep
And now you've got me talking 'bout her in mine

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Ooh, and I bet she has it all
Bet she's beautiful like you, like you
And I bet she's got that touch
Makes you fall in love, like you, like you

[Chorus]
I can taste her lipstick and see her laying across your chest
I can feel the distance every time you remember her fingertips
Maybe I should be more like her
Maybe I should be more like her
I can taste her lipstick, it's like I'm kissing her, too
And she's perfect
And she's perfect

[Verse 2]
How does she touch you? Can I try it, too?
I know you're twisted, but baby, I'm twisted, too
I wanna know how she could make a man lose his mind

[Pre-Chorus 2]
With the smell of her perfume
I could love her, too, like you, like you
And I can almost hear her laugh
Curving on her back for you, for you

[Chorus]
I can taste her lipstick and see her laying across your chest
I can feel the distance every time you remember her fingertips
Maybe I should be more like her
Maybe I should be more like her
I can taste her lipstick, it's like I'm kissing her, too
And she's perfect

[Bridge]
I can see her body rushing into you
Crashing on your skin
Burning within, burning so deep, deep
On your skin, skin next to me
She's crashing on your skin
Settling in, burning so deep, deep
On your skin, skin while you sleep, uh

[Chorus]
I can taste her lipstick and see her laying across your chest
I can feel the distance every time you remember her fingertips
Maybe I should be more like her
Maybe I should be more like her
I can taste her lipstick, it's like I'm kissing her, too
And she's perfect

[Verse 1]
Pull up to the mirror, staring at my face
Gotta chop-chop all the extra weight
I've beencarryingfor fourteen-hundred-sixty days
Gotta,gotta, gotta clean my slate

[Pre-Chorus]
And Imight as well just tell you while I'm drunk, yeah
The truth is that I think I've had enough
Professionally messin' with my trust
How could I confuse that shit for love?

[Chorus]
So I gotta get
You out my head now
I just cut you off
You out my head now
I just cut you off
When I'm without you
I don't overthink it, I just carry on, get
You out my head now

[Verse 2]
I imagine all the endless places I could know
If I drop-drop and I let you go
All the possibilities I got from head to toe
Yeah, they'd, yeah, they'd, yeah, they'd start to show

[Pre-Chorus]
And I might as well just tell you while I'm drunk, yeah
The truth is that I think I've had enough 
Emotionally messin' with my health, ha
How could I confuse that shit for love?

[Chorus]
So I gotta get

Feels so, feels so, feels so good

[Verse 1]
We fall for each other at the wrong time
Only for a moment, but I don't mind
Guess I don't know where to draw the line, the line, the line
And we'll play the same game every night

[Pre-Chorus]
Up in the clouds
Yeah, you know how to make me want you
When we come down
Oh I know, yeah I know, it's over

[Chorus]
You don't know how to love me when you're sober
When the bottle's done you pull me closer
And you're saying all the things that you're supposed to
But you don't know how to love me when you're sober

[Verse 2]
Why is it so different when we wake up?
Same lips, same kiss, but not the same touch
Don't you know that you do it just enough, but not enough
But I know what's next, and I want so much

[Pre-Chorus]
Up in the clouds
Yeah, you know how to make me want you
When we come down
Oh I know, yeah I know, it's over

[Chorus]
You don't know how to love me when you're sober
When the bottle's done you pull me closer
And you're saying all the things that you're supposed to
But you don't know how to love me when you're sober

[Bridge]
I know I should leave, I know I should, should, should
But your love's too good, your love's too good, good, good
I know I should leave, I know I should, should, should
But your love's too good, your love's too good, good, good
Yeah!

[Chorus]
You don't know how to love me when you're sober
When the bottle's done you pull me closer
And you're saying all the things that you're supposed to
But you don't know how to love me when you're sober

[Outro]
You've got a hold on me
You're like a wasted dream
I gave you everything
But you don't know how to love me when you're sober

[Intro]
I dive into the future
But I'm blinded by the sun
I'm reborn in every moment
So who knows what I'll become

[Verse 1]
I feel like I've awakened lately
The chains around me are finally breaking
I've been under self-restoration
I'm becoming my own salvation
Showing up, no more hiding, hiding
The light inside me is bursting, shining
It's my, my, my time to butterfly

[Chorus]
What I've learned is so vital
More than just survival
This is my revival
This is a revival
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Revival
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Revival

[Verse 2]
I'll walk through the fire, I'll begin again
I'll burn through my skin
Cause I, cause I wanna feel it
Reaching for the truth, not afraid to lose
What shot out of me like a rifle was a revival, revival
I admit, it's been painful, painful
But I'll be honest, I'm grateful, grateful
It's my, my, my time to realize

[Chorus]
What I've learned is so vital
More than just survival
This is my revival
This is a revival
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Revival
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Revival

[Bridge]
This won't take too long, you'll see
I'm just tryna get to me, ooh
What shot out of me like a rifle was a revival

[Chorus]
What I've learned is so vital
More than just survival
This is my revival
This is a revival
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Revival
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Revival

[Outro]
What I've learned is so vital
More than just survival
This is my revival
This is a revival

[Chorus]

When you're ready, when you're ready
When you're ready come and get it
Na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na

[Verse 1]
You ain't gotta worry, it's an open invitation
I'll be sitting right here real patient
All day, all night, I'll be waiting standby
Can't stop, because I love it
Hate the way I love you
All day, all night
Maybe I'm addicted for life, no lie

[Pre-Chorus 1]
I'm not too shy to show I love you
I got no regrets
I love you much too much to hide you
This love ain't finished yet
This love ain't finished yet
So baby, whenever you're ready

[Chorus]
When you're ready come and get it
Na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na

[Verse 2]
You got the kind of love that I want, let me get that

And baby, once I get it, I'm yours, no take-backs
Gon' love you for life, I ain't leaving your side
Even if you knock it, ain't no way to stop it
Forever, you're mine
Baby, I'm addicted, no lie, no lie

[Pre-Chorus 2]
I'm not too shy to show I love you
I got no regrets
So baby, whenever you're ready...

[Chorus]
When you're ready come and get it

[Bridge]
This love will be the death of me
But I know I'll die happily
I'll know, I'll know, I'll know
Because you love me so
Yeah

[Chorus]
When you're ready come and get it
Na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na
When you're ready come and get it
Na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na

When you're ready, when you're ready
When you're ready come and get it
(When you're ready, when you're ready
Come and get it, get it)
Na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na

[Verse 1]
Like a prayer surroundin' us, movin' effortlessly
Every word is relief
I'm in dance floor therapy, allmybabies and me
Buttonight, it's for free
No self-sabotage, noletting my thoughts run
Me and this spiral are done
Burn this camouflage I've been wearing for months
Tryna let a little happy in for once

[Pre-Chorus]
I need to let my mind rest
While my body reflects 

[Chorus]
Don't get me down, I won't let me get me 
Don't get me down, I won't let me get me 
I'm good right now, I won't let me get me
Take that tired heart and go and turn it inside-out

[Verse 2]
Diving in ferociously, dancing intimately
I'm so connected to me
In the dark, I'm letting go, so anonymously
I guess this is what it feels like to be free

[Pre-Chorus]
I need to let my mind rest 
While my body reflects 

[Chorus]
Don't get me down, I won't let me get me 
Don't get me down, I won't let me get me 
I'm good right now, I won't let me get me
Take that tired heart and go and turn it inside-out
Don't get me down , I won't let me get me 
Don't get me down , I won't let me get me 
I'm good right now , I won't let me get me
Take that tired heart and go and turn it inside

[Bridge]
Oh my, I guess this is what it feels like to be free 
Oh my, I guess this is what it feels like to see me 
 Don't get me, oh 
 Don't get me 
 Take that tired heart and go and turn it inside-out

[Chorus]
Don't get me down , I won't let me get me 
Don't get me down , I won't let me get me 
I'm good right now , I won't let me get me
Take that tired heart and go and turn it inside-out

[Verse 1]
Hey, you started out sweeter than hard candy
Words were like licorice to the taste
But slowly, all the sugar, it went to waste
Went to waste
Oh, you started getting funny with no jokes
I started seein' through you like a ghost
And now I'm pretty sure I can't take no more
I can't take no more-ore

[Chorus]
I think you're kind of crazy
And not the good kind, baby
'Cause you're actin' super shady
You know it, you know it
Been dodgin' phone calls lately
But still textin' me, "Baby"
Yeah, I think you're kind of crazy
You know it, you know it
You've been lyin' just for fun
Luckily, no damage done
But now I see you're kind of crazy
You know it, you know it

[Post-Chorus]
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh, oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh, oh

[Verse 2]
Hey, you're the one who started talkin' to me
Made the move, asked me to be your babe
And now you're treatin' me like I'm insane
You're insane

[Chorus]
I think you're kind of crazy
And not the good kind, baby
'Cause you're actin' super shady
You know it, you know it
Been dodgin' phone calls lately
But still textin' me, "Baby"
Yeah, I think you're kind of crazy
You know it, you know it
You've been lyin' just for fun
Luckily, no damage done
But now I see you're kind of crazy
You know it, you know it

[Post-Chorus]
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh, oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh, oh

[Bridge]
Hey
Hey, hey 
Hey 
Hey, hey 

[Chorus]
I think you're kind of crazy
And not the good kind, baby
'Cause you're actin' super shady
You know it, you know it
Been dodgin' phone calls lately
But still textin' me, "Baby"
Yeah, I think you're kind of crazy
You know it, you know it

[Post-Chorus]
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh, oh 
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh, oh 

[Outro]
Hmm, I don't know

[Verse 1]
Well, you know everything's gonna to be a breeze
And the end will no doubt justify the means
You can fix any problem with the slightest of ease


[Verse 2]
But you might find out it'll go to your head
When you write a report on a book you've never read
With the snap of your fingers you can make your bed!


[Chorus]
Everything is not what it seems
When you can get all you wanted in your wildest dreams
You might run into trouble if you go to extremes
Because everything is not what it seems

[Chorus]
Everything is not what it seems
When you can have what you want by the simplest of means
Be careful not to mess with the balance of things
Because everything is not... what it seems

[Intro]
Da, da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da
Da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da
Da-da-da-da-da-da

[Verse 1]
She was too young to be the Hollywood type
Too pure to understand the lowsandthe highs
She didn'tknow if she was gonna survive
Itall got so much better with time

[Pre-Chorus]
All of the evil eyes
Tequila before sunrise
I'd tell her to watch her back
That she's worth more than that

[Chorus]
'Cause she was a girl with good intentions
Yeah, she made some bad decisions
And she learned a couple lessons
Wish I could tell her
She was a girl with good intentions
Didn't need the second-guessing
Didn't need to ever question
Wish I could tell her

[Verse 2]
She didn't know all of the hurt she could take
Her world was crumbling and so was her faith
Wish I could talk to her 'cause what I would say
"Oh baby, you're enough to get you out of this place"

[Pre-Chorus]
All of the flashing lights
Tequila before sunrise
I'd tell her to watch her back
That she's worth more than that

[Chorus]
But she was a girl with good intentions
Yeah, she made some bad decisions
And she learned a couple lessons
Wish I could tell her
She was a girl with good intentions
Didn't need the second-guessing
Didn't need to ever question
Wish I could tell her

[Post-Chorus]
Da, da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da
Da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da
Da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da
I tried to tell her

[Bridge]

I know you'll get the chance to find who you are
I know you'll have a choice before it gets too dark

I know you'll get the chance to find who you are
I know you'll have the choice

[Chorus]
She was a girl with good intentions
Yeah, she made some bad decisions
And she learned a couple lessons 
Wish I could tell her
She was a girl with good intentions 
Didn't need the second-guessing 
Didn't need to ever question
Wish I could tell her

[Outro]
Da, da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da 
Da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da

Da, da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da 
Da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da
Da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da 

[Verse 1]
Now that I have captured your attention
I wanna steal you for a rhythm intervention
Mr. TSA, I'm ready for inspection
Sh-sh-show me how you make a first impression

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, oh
Can we take it nice and slow, slow?
Break it down and drop it low, low
'Cause I just wanna party all night in the neon lights
So you can't let me go

[Chorus]
I just wanna feel your body right next to mine
All night long, baby, slow down the song
And when it's coming closer to the end, hit rewind
All night long, baby, slow down the song
Yeah, baby, slow down the song
Yeah, baby, slow down the song

[Verse 2]
If you want me, I'm accepting applications
So long as we ke-keep this record on rotation
You know I'm good with mouth-to-mouth resuscitation
Breathe me in, breathe me out
So amazing

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, oh
Can we take it nice and slow, slow?
Break it down and drop it low, low
Cause I just wanna party all night in the neon lights
'Til you can't let me go

[Chorus]
I just wanna feel your body right next to mine
All night long, baby, slow down the song
And when it's coming closer to the end, hit rewind
All night long, baby, slow down the song
Yeah, baby, slow down the song
Yeah, baby, slow down the song

[Bridge]

The music's got me going

No stopping 'til the morning

You know I'm ready for it, for it, for it, yeah

The music's got me going

No stopping 'til the morning

You know I'm ready for it, for it, for it, yeah

[Interlude]
It's The Cataracs

[Chorus]
I just wanna feel your body right next to mine
All night long, baby, slow down the song
And when it's coming closer to the end, hit rewind
All night long, baby, slow down the song
Yeah, baby, slow down the song
Yeah, baby, slow down the song

[Outro]
How do I do it?
It's The Cataracs
Ha ha ha

[Verse 1]
Drop down on a desert ride
Just outside the 95
Never felt more, more alive
I got my chicas by my side

[Pre-Chorus]
And if we want it, we take it
If we need money, we make it
Nobody knows if we fake it
You like to watch while we shake it
I know we're making you thirsty
You want us all in the worst way
But you don't understand
I don't need a man

[Chorus]
Me and my girls, me and my girls
Me and my, me and my, me and my, me and my girls
Me and my girls, me and my girls
No jodas, nosotras
Me and my girls
Me and my girls

[Verse 2]
The night is dark but the moon is bright
We're staring at this summer night
Tan skin looks damn good in white
Stripping down by the Hollywood sign

[Pre-Chorus]
And if we want it, we take it
If we need money, we make it
Nobody knows if we fake it
You like to watch while we shake it
I know we're making you thirsty
You want us all in the worst way
But you don't understand
I don't need a man

[Chorus]
Me and my girls, me and my girls
Me and my, me and my, me and my, me and my girls
Me and my girls, me and my girls
No jodas nosotras
Me and my girls
Me and my girls

[Bridge]
I'm going home with who I came with
And who I came with's not you
I'm going home with who I came with
And who I came with's not you
I'm going home with who I came with
And who I came with's not you
I'm going home with who I came with
And who I came with's
Me and my girls, me and my girls
You can look, but don't touch
I'm not here to hook up
I'm just here to turn up
Tonight is just us

[Chorus / Outro]
Me and my girls
Me and my girls
Me and my girls
No jodas nosotras
Me and my girls

[Verse 1]
No heart, no hands, no skin, no touch
Can get me there, nowhere enough
To love me like you do, to love me like you do
No kiss, no lips, no feel, no rush
Can you keep me high, I swear no one
Can love me like you do, can love me like you do, no

[Chorus]
Nobody's gonna love me like you
Nobody, uh
Nobody, no uh
Nobody's gonna love me like you do
Like you, ooh
Nobody's gonna love me like you
Nobody, uh
Nobody, no uh
Nobody's ever led me to the truth
Like you, ooh

Nobody's gonna love me like you
Nobody, nobody ooh

[Verse 2]
No oxygen, can barely breathe
My darkest sin, you've raised release
And it's all because of you, all because of you
I don't know what it is, but you've pulled me in
No one compares, could ever begin
To love me like you do
And I wouldn't want them to
Cause...

[Chorus]
Nobody's gonna love me like you
Nobody, uh
Nobody, no uh
Nobody's gonna love me like you do
Like you, ooh
Nobody's gonna love me like you
Nobody, uh
Nobody, no uh
Nobody's ever loved me to the truth
Like you, ooh

[Chorus]
Nobody's gonna love me like you
Nobody, uh
Nobody, no uh
Nobody's gonna love me like you do
Like you, ooh
Nobody's gonna love me like you
Nobody, uh
Nobody, no uh
Nobody's ever loved me to the truth
Like you, ooh

[Bridge]
I don't want nothing else
Not when I had the best
I don't want nothing else
Because you showed me the best

[Chorus]
Nobody's gonna love me like you
Nobody, uh
Nobody, no uh
Nobody's gonna love me like you do
Like you, ooh
Nobody's gonna love me like you
Nobody, uh
Nobody, no uh
Nobody's ever loved me to the truth
Like you, ooh

[Verse 1]
Dead-end streets and boulevards
You threw in the towel, I broke your heart
But there's a first time for everything
Who would've thought you'd feel so cold
And all these memories seem so old
To think you were my everything

[Pre-Chorus]
Remember when we'd talk all night
But time ain't easy on us, how can love die?

[Chorus]
I got so much shit to say
But I can't help feeling like I'm camouflage
Fortress around my heart
You were mine just yesterday
Now I have no idea who you are
It's like you camouflage

[Post-Chorus]
But it's good to see you here again
I don't wanna say goodbye
But it's about half past ten
And I have to catch my ride

[Verse 2]
Riding alone on the 405
And life's so fragile, it's like I could cry
If that's the last time I'd see you again
But I'll never tell you just how I felt
You might just not care, and it might just not help
What if the feelings just don't make no sense to you, you

[Pre-Chorus]
Remember when we'd talk all night
But time ain't easy on us, how can love die?

[Chorus]
I got so much shit to say
But I can't help feeling like I'm camouflage
Fortress around my heart
You were mine just yesterday
Now I have no idea who you are
It's like you camouflage

[Post-Chorus]
But it's good to see you here again
I don't wanna say goodbye
But it's about half past ten
And I have to catch my ride

[Chorus]
I got so much shit to say
But I can't help feeling like I'm camouflage
Fortress around my heart
You were mine just yesterday
Now I have no idea who you are
It's like you camouflage

[Post-Chorus]
But it's good to see you here again
I don't wanna say goodbye
But it's about half past ten
And I have to catch my ride

[Verse 1]
This is just what the doctor ordered 
Put a gold star on my disorder
Yeah, we'vetalkedaround every corner
IfI'm lookin' at you and me,we're on some kind of symmetry
I'm a sensitive situation 
You're a hot and cold combination
Oh, we both know we got complications 
If I'm lookin' at you and me, we're on some kind of symmetry, oh

[Pre-Chorus]
I try not to bother, not to bother you 
But my kind of trouble likes your trouble too 

[Chorus]
Can't stop myself, it's true
I like the way you move, uh-huh
Oh, we got somethin' in this room
Can't make that up
You may not be the one, uh-huh
But you look like fun
Oh-oh-oh , oh-oh-oh
You look like fun 
Oh-oh-oh , oh-oh-oh

[Verse 2]
Can we keep it on a first name basis? 
We could overcrowd each other's spaces
You get me higher than my medication
Take me to different places, let's face it, I'm gettin' impatient 

[Pre-Chorus]
I try not to bother, not to bother you 
But my kind of trouble likes your trouble too 

[Chorus]
Can't stop myself, it's true
I like the way you move, uh-huh
Oh, we got somethin' in this room
Can't make that up
You may not be the one, uh-huh
But you look like fun 
Oh-oh-oh , oh-oh-oh
You look like fun 
Oh-oh-oh , oh-oh-oh

[Bridge]
You look like
You don't, but you know how
Like a beautiful breakdown
And it's just not right, but you look like
You don't, but you know how
Make me wanna slow down
And it's just not right that you look like

[Outro]
Fun 
Oh-oh-oh , oh-oh-oh
You look like fun 
Oh-oh-oh , oh-oh-oh
You look like fun

[Verse 1]
You were the one, the one that I could run to
You were the one, the one that I would beg for, no
And you were the one that made me believe that I could be better
Yeah, you were the one, the one that I would run to

[Chorus]
Now I'm stained by you
Like a coffee ring upon this table
I'm unstable, I am stained by you
Like a goddamn soldier that just can't forget the battle
I am stained by you
Like a coffee ring upon this table
I'm unstable, I am stained by you
By you, by you, oh-oh

[Verse 2]
You had a way of making me feel special, yeah
Then take it away and say I wasn't special, no
And now it's messed up that bad kind of love
Is the only thing that makes me better
Yeah, you had your way
I'm trying to pull myself together

[Chorus]
'Cause now I'm stained by you
Like a coffee ring upon this table
I'm unstable, I am stained by you
Like a goddamn soldier that just can't forget the battle
I am stained by you
Like a coffee ring upon this table
I'm unstable, I am stained by you
By you, by you, oh-oh

[Bridge]
Oh, it should be easy to let you go
But I love you and I hate that you know
It should be easy to let you go
But I love you and I hate that you know

[Chorus]
Now I'm stained by you
Like a coffee ring upon this table
I'm unstable, I am stained by you
Like a goddamn soldier that just can't forget the battle
I am stained by you
Like a coffee ring upon this table
I'm unstable, I am stained by you
By you, by you, oh-oh[Produced by: Matt Man & Da Robin]

[Verse 1]
Ooh, the rhythm takes you over
Takes you to a different place
A different space
Ooh, the smoke is getting closer
I can feel our young blood race
Through cityscapes

[Pre-Chorus]
And everybody wants to be touched
Everybody wants to get some
But don't you play a song about love
When I move my body
I don't have to talk about none
Let the chemicals do its stuff
'Til the energy is too much

[Chorus]
Yeah, all I need
Is the rhythm
Me and the rhythm
Nothing between
Yeah, the rhythm
Me and the rhythm
And I know, I know, I know
I can't fight it
I won't, I won't, I won't
Deny it
Oh no, oh no, oh no
I'd be lying
If I said I didn't need
Yeah, the rhythm
Me and the rhythm

[Verse 2]
Ooh, I start to feel it now
Feeling like I'm truly free
I'm free in me
Ooh, the heat's a common ground
No matter what's your history
Be free with me, oh

[Pre-Chorus]
And everybody wants to be touched
Everybody wants to get some
But don't you play a song about love
When I move my body
I don't have to talk about none
Let the chemicals do its stuff
'Til the energy is too much

[Chorus]
Yeah, all I need
Is the rhythm
Me and the rhythm
Nothing between
Yeah, the rhythm
Me and the rhythm
And I know, I know, I know
I can't fight it
I won't, I won't, I won't
Deny it
Oh no, oh no, oh no
I'd be lying
If I said I didn't need
Yeah, the rhythm
Me and the rhythm

[Bridge]
If you feel like you're the spark
Then come out of the dark
If you feel like you're the spark
Then come out of the dark
If you feel like you're the spark
Then come out of the dark
If you feel like you're the spark
Then come out of the dark

[Chorus]
Yeah, all I need
Is the rhythm
Me and the rhythm
Nothing between
Yeah, the rhythm
Me and the rhythm
And I know, I know, I know
I can't fight it
I won't, I won't, I won't
Deny it
Oh no, oh no, oh no
I'd be lying
If I said I didn't need
Yeah, the rhythm
Me and the rhythm[Spoken Intro]
Hey babe, it's me. Umm I just wanted to call and tell you that I love you so so so so much. I just wanted to let you know that you are my princess, you are worthy of all of the love in the world. You are the love of my life...

[Verse 1]
Now's all we got
And time can't be bought
I know it inside my heart
Forever will forever be ours
Even if we try to forget, love will remember
You said you loved me, I said I loved you back
What happened to that?
What happened to that?
All your promises and all them plans we had
What happened to that?
What happened to that?

[Pre-Chorus]
Boom, gone
Yeah, we move on
Even if we try to forget

[Chorus]
Love will remember you
And love will remember me
I know it inside my heart
Forever will forever be ours
Even if we try to forget, love will remember
Love will remember, love will remember
Love will remember, love will remember

[Verse 2]
The trips we dreamed of taking, the tacks left on the map
What happened to that?
What happened to that?
When all you had was nothing, and all we did was laugh
What happened, what happened, what happened to that?

[Pre-Chorus]
Boom, gone
Yeah, we move on
Even if we try to forget

[Chorus]
Love will remember you
And love will remember me
I know it inside my heart
Forever will forever be ours
Even if we try to forget, love will remember
Love will remember, love will remember
Love will remember, love will remember
Love will remember, love will remember
Love will remember, love will remember

[Bridge]
Break down the walls, let heaven in
Somewhere in forever, we'll dance again
We used to be inseparable
I used to think that I was irreplaceable
We lit the whole world up before we blew it up
I still don't know just how we screwed it up
Forever, forever, forever

[Chorus]
Love will remember you
And love will remember me
I know it inside my heart
Forever will forever be ours
Even if we try to forget, love will remember
Love will remember, love will remember
Love will remember, love will remember
Love will remember, love will remember
Love will remember, love will remember

[Verse 1]
You can stand beside the madness like a falling tear
You can hold onto the sadness like a souvenir
Or you can close your eyes and see your life
Like the air

You can tap into the strength you never knew you had
You can breathe into your faith no matter where youre at
Just close your eyes and change your life
Like the air

[Chorus]
Like the air you can
Rise from the rubble with your mind, you can hover
You can rise like the tide, like the heat it in the summer
Yes, I know there are those who will wanna bring you down
But you can rise with your mind and make your higher power proud
Like the air you can rise
Rise

[Verse 2]
The earth can pull you down with all its gravity
And the measure of your worth is sometimes hard to see
So just hold on, when the night is done
Like the sun

[Chorus]
Like the air you can
Rise from the rubble with your mind, you can hover
You can rise like the tide, like the heat it in the summer
Yes, I know there are those who will wanna bring you down
But you can rise with your mind and make your higher power proud
Like the air you can rise
Rise

[Bridge]
So even when your bones feel like weights
And its hard to lift the smile on your perfect face
You can still find a peaceful place
Close your eyes until you're floating up in outer space
Itll be alright, theyre just jealous of your highs
So they can knock you down, but

[Chorus]
Like the air you can
Rise from the rubble with your mind, you can hover
You can rise like the tide, like the heat it in the summer
Yes, I know there are those who will wanna bring you down
But you can rise with your mind and make your higher power proud
Like the air you can rise
Rise

[Verse 1]
There's a reason you're everywhere
Breathe you in like you're in the air
Maybe you should call off the day
Give your girl some time to play
In my room, from the ceiling to the floor
My body knows that you've been here before

[Chorus]
Every second here without you, I pretend we're skin to skin
Every single breath reminds me that you never, ever left
Every time I think about you, I can feel my hand give in
Cause you're keeping me safe and warm
Even when I'm home alone
Wearing nothing but your cologne

[Verse 2]
Maybe you should call off the day
Give your girl some time to play
Running my mind cause my heart lost all control
Only one thing that can give me that multiple

[Chorus]
Every second here without you, I pretend we're skin to skin
Every single breath reminds me that you never, ever left
Every time I think about you, I can feel my hand give in
Cause you're keeping me safe and warm
Even when I'm home alone
Wearing nothing but your cologne
Wearing nothing but your cologne
Wearing nothing but your cologne, cologne
Wearing nothing but your cologne

[Bridge]
All the way down
Feels like you're around
Forever in the moment
I love it, and you know it
All the way down
Feels like you're around
Forever in the moment
I love it, and you know it

[Chorus]
Every second here without you, I pretend we're skin to skin
Every single breath reminds me that you never, ever left
Every time I think about you, I can feel my hand give in
Cause you're keeping me safe and warm
Even when I'm home alone
Wearing nothing but your cologne
Wearing nothing but your cologne
Wearing nothing but your cologne, cologne
Wearing nothing but your cologne
Wearing nothing but your cologne

[Intro]
Wild, wild, wild, wild, wild
Wild, wild, wild, wild, wild
Mmm

[Verse 1]
You built me from a broken heart
With bricks you made from broken parts
You've fixed the paint, so we could start
So now what's mine is ours
I still have proof in form of scars
The first time always falls so far
Those healing wounds heal twice as hard
But now what's mine is ours
But now what's mine is ours

[Chorus]
We are survivors
We are survivors of the wild
We are survivors
We are survivors of the wild

[Verse 2]
My sweet devoted counterpart
We catch each other's shooting stars
However close, however far
Whatever's mine is ours
Whatever's mine is ours

[Chorus]
We are survivors
We are survivors of the wild
We are survivors
We are survivors of the wild
We are survivors
We are survivors of the wild
We are survivors 
We are survivors of the wild

Strawberry champagne on ice

Girl, I'll be a fleeko

Say it's us  and I'll agree, baby

Tell me what's on your mind 
If you want it, girl come and get it
All this is here for you
Tell me baby, tell me, tell me baby

[Chorus]
Gold jewelry shining so bright
Strawberry champagne on ice

Let's take our time tonight, girl
Above us all the stars are watchin'
There's no place I'd rather be in this world
Your eyes are where I'm lost in
Underneath the chandelier
We're dancin' all alone
There's no reason to hide
What we're feelin' inside
Right now

[Pre-Chorus]
So, baby, let's just turn down the lights
And close the door
Oooh I love that dress
But you won't need it anymore
No, you won't need it no more
Let's just kiss 'til we're naked, baby

Versace on the floor
Oooh take it off for me, for me, for me, for me now, girl

Now I unzip the back to watch it fall
While I kiss your neck and shoulders
No, don't be afraid to show it all
I'll be right here ready to hold you
Girl, you know you're perfect from
Your head down to your heels
Don't be confused by my smile
'Cause I ain't ever been more for real, for real

[Pre-Chorus]

Tonight

Throw your hands up in the sky

[Chorus]
Players, put yo' pinky rings up to the moon
Girls, what y'all trying to do?
24 karat magic in the air
Head to toe so player
Uh, look out!

[Verse 1]
Pop pop, it's show time 
Show time 
Guess who's back again?
Oh they don't know? 
Oh they don't know? 
I bet they know soon as we walk in 
Wearing Cuban links 
Designer minks 
Inglewood's finest shoes 
Don't look too hard
Might hurt ya'self
Known to give the color red the blues

[Pre-Chorus]
Ooh shit, I'm a dangerous man with some money in my pocket

So many pretty girls around me and they waking up the rocket

Why you mad? Fix ya face
Ain't my fault y'all be jocking


[Chorus]
Players only, come on
Put your pinky rings up to the moon
Girls, what y'all trying to do?
24 karat magic in the air
Head to toe so player
Uh, look out!

[Verse 2]
Second verse for the hustlas 
Gangstas 
Bad bitches and ya ugly ass friends 
Can I preach?  Can I preach? 
I gotta show 'em how a pimp get it in
First, take your sip , do your dip 
Spend your money like money ain't shit 
We too fresh
Got to blame it on Jesus
Hashtag blessed
They ain't ready for me

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm a dangerous man with some money in my pocket

So many pretty girls around me and they waking up the rocket

Why you mad? Fix ya face

Uh, look out

[Outro]
[Verse 1]
Same bed but it feels just a little bit bigger now
Our song on the radio but it don't sound the same
When our friends talk about you, all it does is just tear me down
'Cause my heart breaks a little when I hear your name

[Pre-Chorus]
It all just sounds like oooooh ooh
Mmm, too young, too dumb to realize

[Chorus]
That I should have bought you flowers
And held your hand
Should have gave you all my hours
When I had the chance
Take you to every party
'Cause all you wanted to do was dance
Now my baby's dancing
But she's dancing with another man

[Verse 2]
My pride, my ego, my needs, and my selfish ways
Caused a good, strong woman like you to walk out my life
Now I'll never, never get to clean up the mess I made 
And it haunts me every time I close my eyes

[Pre-Chorus]
It all just sounds like oooooh ooh
Mmm, too young, too dumb to realize

[Chorus]
That I should have bought you flowers
And held your hand
Should have gave you all my hours
When I had the chance
Take you to every party
'Cause all you wanted to do was dance
Now my baby's dancing
But she's dancing with another man

[Bridge]
Although it hurts
I'll be the first to say that I was wrong
Oh, I know I'm probably much too late
To try and apologize for my mistakes
But I just want you to know

[Chorus]
I hope he buys you flowers
I hope he holds your hand
Give you all his hours
When he has the chance
Take you to every party
'Cause I remember how much you loved to dance
Do all the things I should have done
When I was your man

[Outro]
Do all the things I should have done
When I was your man

[Verse 1]
Ooh, don't we look good together?
There's a reason why they watch all night long
Yeah, know we'll turn heads forever
So tonight I'm gonna show you off

[Pre-Chorus]
When I'm walkin' with you
I watch the whole room change
Baby, that's what you do
No my baby don't play
Blame it on my confidence
Oh, blame it on your measurements
Shut that shit down on sight
That's right

[Chorus]
We out here drippin' in finesse
It don't make no sense
Out here drippin' in finesse
You know it, you know it
We out here drippin' in finesse
It don't make no sense
Out here drippin' in finesse
You know it, you know it

[Verse 2]
Now slow it down for me baby
'Cause I love the way it feels when we grind
Yeah, our connection's so magnetic on the floor
Nothing can stop us tonight

[Pre-Chorus]
When I'm walkin' with you
I watch the whole room change
Baby, that's what you do
No my baby don't play
Blame it on my confidence
Oh, blame it on your measurements
Shut that shit down on sight
That's right

[Chorus]
We out here drippin' in finesse
It don't make no sense
Out here drippin' in finesse
You know it, you know it
We out here drippin' in finesse
It don't make no sense
Out here drippin' in finesse
You know it, you know it

[Bridge]
Fellas, grab your ladies if your lady fine
Tell her she the one, she the one for life 
Ladies, grab your fellas and let's do this right 
If you're on one like me in mind 
Yeah, we got it goin' on, got it goin' on
Don't it feel so good to be us? 
Yeah, we got it goin' on, got it goin' on 
Girl, we got it goin' on

Don't it feel so good to be us, ayy?

[Chorus]

Out here drippin' in finesse
You know it, you know it 

[Outro]

Girl, we got it
Don't it feel so good to be us, ayy?
Yeah, we got it goin' on, got it goin' on
You know it, you know it

[Verse 1]
Oh, her eyes, her eyes
Make the stars look like they're not shinin'
Her hair, her hair
Falls perfectly without her trying
She's so beautiful
And I tell her every day
Yeah, I know, I know
When I compliment her she won't believe me
And it's so, it's so
Sad to think that she don't see what I see
But every time she asks me, "Do I look okay?"
I say

[Chorus]
When I see your face
There's not a thing that I would change
'Cause you're amazing just the way you are
And when you smile
The whole world stops and stares for a while
'Cause, girl, you're amazing just the way you are

[Verse 2]
Her lips, her lips
I could kiss them all day if she'd let me
Her laugh, her laugh
She hates but I think it's so sexy
She's so beautiful, and I tell her every day
Oh you know, you know, you know
I'd never ask you to change
If perfect's what you're searching for
Then just stay the same
So don't even bother asking if you look okay
You know I'll say

[Chorus]
When I see your face
There's not a thing that I would change
'Cause you're amazing just the way you are
And when you smile
The whole world stops and stares for a while
'Cause, girl, you're amazing just the way you are

[Post-Chorus]
The way you are
The way you are
Girl, you're amazing just the way you are

[Chorus]
When I see your face
There's not a thing that I would change
'Cause you're amazing just the way you are
And when you smile
The whole world stops and stares for a while
'Cause, girl, you're amazing just the way you are, yeah

[Verse 1]
Easy come, easy go, that's just how you live, oh
Take, take, take it all, but you never give
Shoulda known you was trouble from the first kiss
Had your eyes wide open; why were they open? 

[Pre-Chorus]
Gave you all I had and you tossed it in the trash
You tossed it in the trash, you did
To give me all your love is all I ever ask
'Cause what you don't understand is

[Chorus]
I'd catch a grenade for ya 
Throw my hand on a blade for ya 
I'd jump in front of a train for ya 
You know I'd do anything for ya 
Oh, oh-oh oh oh, I would go through all this pain
Take a bullet straight through my brain
Yes, I would die for ya baby
But you won't do the same

[Post-Chorus]
No, no, no, no, oh-oh oh...

[Verse 2]
Black, black, black and blue, beat me 'til I'm numb
Tell the devil I said "Hey" when you get back to where you're from
Mad woman, bad woman, that's just what you are
Yeah, you'll smile in my face then rip the brakes out my car

[Pre-Chorus]
Gave you all I had and you tossed it in the trash
You tossed it in the trash; yes, you did!
To give me all your love is all I ever ask
'Cause what you don't understand is

[Chorus]
I'd catch a grenade for ya 
Throw my hand on a blade for ya 
I'd jump in front of a train for ya 
You know I'd do anything for ya

Throw my hand on a blade for ya

Today, I don't feel like doing anything
I just wanna lay in my bed
Don't feel like picking up my phone
So leave a message at the tone
'Cause today, I swear, I'm not doing anything

[Verse 1]
I'm gonna kick my feet up, then stare at the fan
Turn the TV on, throw my hand in my pants
Nobody's gonna tell me I can't
I'll be lounging on the couch
Just chillin' in my Snuggie
Click to MTV, so they can teach me how to dougie
'Cause in my castle I'm the freaking man

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh oh, yes I said it
I said it, I said it, 'cause I can

[Chorus]
Today, I don't feel like doing anything
I just wanna lay in my bed
Don't feel like picking up my phone
So leave a message at the tone
'Cause today, I swear, I'm not doing anything
Nothing at all
Nothing at all

[Verse 2]
Tomorrow, I'll wake up, do some P90X
Meet a really nice girl, have some really nice sex
She's gonna scream out, "This is great!"

Yeah, I might mess around and get my college degree
I bet my old man will be so proud of me
But sorry pops, you'll just have to wait

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh oh, yes I said it
I said it, I said it, 'cause I can

[Chorus]
Today, I don't feel like doing anything
I just wanna lay in my bed
Don't feel like picking up my phone
So leave a message at the tone
'Cause today, I swear, I'm not doing anything

[Bridge]
No, I ain't gonna comb my hair
'Cause I ain't going anywhere
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no
I'll just strut in my birthday suit
And let everything hang loose
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Chorus]
Oh, today, I don't feel like doing anything
I just wanna lay in my bed
Don't feel like picking up my phone
So leave a message at the tone
'Cause today, I swear, I'm not doing anything
Nothing at all
Nothing at all

[Verse 1]
I know you're somewhere out there
Somewhere far away
I want you back, I want you back
My neighbors think I'm crazy
But they don't understand
You're all I have, you're all I have

[Pre-Chorus]
At night when the stars light up my room
I sit by myself...

[Chorus]
Talking to the moon
Trying to get to you
In hopes you're on the other side talking to me too
Or am I a fool, who sits alone, talking to the moon?

[Verse 2]
I'm feeling like I'm famous, the talk of the town
They say I've gone mad
Yeah, I've gone mad
But they don't know what I know
Cause when the sun goes down someone's talking back
Yeah, they're talking back, oh

[Pre-Chorus]
At night when the stars light up my room
I sit by myself...

[Chorus]
Talking to the moon
Trying to get to you
In hopes you're on the other side talking to me too
Or am I a fool, who sits alone, talking to the moon?

[Bridge]
Do you ever hear me calling?
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Cause every night, I'm talking to the moon

[Chorus]
Still trying to get to you
In hopes you're on the other side talking to me too
Or am I a fool, who sits alone, talking to the moon?

[Outro]
I know you're somewhere out there
Somewhere far away

[Verse 1]
I've made mistakes
I could have treated you better
I let you get away
There goes my happily ever after

[Pre-Chorus]
Tell me why, why can't we try and start again?
This can't be how our story ends
You're more than my girl, you're my best friend
Tell me you remember when
Ooh, when I was your man and you were my girl
It was you and me against the world

[Chorus]
Baby, ain't nobody gonna love me like the way you do
And you ain't never gonna find a love like mine
Tell me what can I do to make it up to you?
'Cause what we got's too good to say goodbye, goodbye

[Verse 2]
Yeah, I'm still in love with you darlin'
I know you feel the same
Oh, what's the point of both of us being broken-hearted?
I pray it's never too late

[Pre-Chorus]
So tell me, why, why can't we try and start again?
This can't be how our story ends
You're more than my girl, you're my best friend
Tell me you remember when
I was your man and you were my girl
It was you and me against the world

[Chorus]
Baby, ain't nobody gonna love me like the way you do
And you ain't never gonna find a love like mine
Tell me what can I do to make it up to you?
'Cause what we got's too good to say goodbye, goodbye

[Bridge]

Girl won't you listen?

It's you that I'm missin'

Take my hand, I wanna go, I wanna go

If we're gonna fight this fight for better days
I know we're gonna make it
This is the chance, let's take it

[Chorus]
Baby, ain't nobody gonna love me like the way you do

And you ain't never gonna find a love like mine

Tell me what can I do to make it up to you?
'Cause what we got's too good to say goodbye
 goodbye 
Baby, ain't nobody gonna love me like the way you do
And you ain't never gonna find a love like mine

Tell me what can I do to make it up to you?
'Cause what we got's too good to say goodbye, goodbye

[Verse 1]
If you ever leave me, baby
Leave some morphine at my door
'Cause it would take a whole lot of medication
To realize what we used to have
We don't have it anymore
There's no religion that could save me
No matter how long my knees are on the floor, oh
So keep in mind all the sacrifices I'm making
To keep you by my side
To keep you from walking out the door

[Chorus]
'Cause there'll be no sunlight
If I lose you, baby
There'll be no clear skies
If I lose you, baby
Just like the clouds
My eyes will do the same if you walk away
Everyday, it'll rain
Rain, rain

[Verse 2]
I'll never be your mother's favorite
Your daddy can't even look me in the eye
Ooh, if I was in their shoes, I'd be doing the same thing
Saying, "There goes my little girl
Walking with that troublesome guy"
But they're just afraid of something they can't understand
Ooh, but little darling watch me change their minds
Yeah, for you I'll try, I'll try, I'll try, I'll try
And pick up these broken pieces till I'm bleeding
If that'll make you mine

[Chorus]
'Cause there'll be no sunlight
If I lose you, baby
There'll be no clear skies
If I lose you, baby
Just like the clouds
My eyes will do the same if you walk away
Everyday, it'll rain
Rain, rain

[Bridge]
Ooh, don't you say 
Goodbye 
Don't you say 
Goodbye 
I'll pick up these broken pieces till I'm bleeding
If that'll make it right

[Chorus]
'Cause there'll be no sunlight
If I lose you, baby
And there'll be no clear skies
If I lose you, baby
And just like the clouds
My eyes will do the same if you walk away
Everyday, it'll rain
Rain, rain

[Chorus]
It's a beautiful night
We're looking for something dumb to do
Hey baby, I think I wanna marry you
Is it the look in your eyes, or is it this dancing juice?
Who cares, baby, I think I wanna to marry you

[Verse 1]
Well, I know this little chapel on the boulevard we can go
No one will know
Oh, come on, girl
Who cares if we're trashed
Got a pocket full of cash we can blow
Shots of patron
And it's on, girl

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't say no, no, no, no, no
Just say yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
And we'll go, go, go, go, go
If you're ready, like I'm ready

[Chorus]
Cause it's a beautiful night
We're looking for something dumb to do
Hey baby, I think I wanna marry you
Is it the look in your eyes, or is it this dancing juice?
Who cares, baby, I think I wanna marry you, oh

[Verse 2]
I'll go get a ring, let the choir bells sing, like ooh
So what you wanna do?
Let's just run girl
If we wake up and you wanna break up, that's cool
No, I won't blame you
It was fun, girl

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't say no, no, no, no, no
Just say yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
And we'll go, go, go, go, go
If you're ready, like I'm ready

[Chorus]
Cause it's a beautiful night
We're looking for something dumb to do
Hey baby, I think I wanna marry you
Is it the look in your eyes, or is it this dancing juice?
Who cares, baby, I think I wanna marry you, oh

[Bridge]
Just say, "I do..."
Tell me right now baby
Tell me right now baby, baby
Just say, "I do..."
Tell me right now baby
Tell me right now baby, baby

[Chorus]
Oh, it's a beautiful night
We're looking for something dumb to do
Hey baby, I think I wanna marry you
Is it the look in your eyes, or is it this dancing juice?
Who cares, baby, I think I wanna marry you

[Verse 1]
Ooh, I got a body full of liquor
With a cocaine kicker
And I'm feeling like I'm thirty feet tall
So lay it down, lay it down
You got your legs up in the sky
With the devil in your eyes
Let me hear you say you want it all
Say it now, say it now

[Pre-Chorus]
Look what you're doing
Look what you've done
But in this jungle you can't run
Cause what I got for you, I promise it's a killa
You'll be banging on my chest, bang bang, gorilla

[Chorus]
Ooh, yeah
You and me, baby, making love like gorillas
Ooh, yeah
You and me, baby, making love like gorillas

[Verse 2]
Yeah, I got a fistful of your hair
But you don't look like you're scared
You're just smiling, tell me "Daddy, it's yours"
Cause you know how I like it you's a dirty little lover
If the neighbors call the cops
Call the sheriff, call the SWAT, we don't stop
We keep rocking while they knocking on our door
And you're screaming, "Give it to me baby
Give it to me, motherfucker!"

[Pre-Chorus]
Look what you're doing
Look what you've done
But in this jungle you can't run
Cause what I got for you, I promise it's a killa
You'll be banging on my chest, bang bang, gorilla

[Chorus]
Ooh, yeah
You and me, baby, making love like gorillas
Ooh, yeah
You and me, baby, making love like gorillas

[Bridge]
I bet you never ever felt so good, so good
I got your body trembling like it should, it should
You'll never be the same, baby, once I'm done with

[Chorus]
Oho, you with me, baby, making love like gorillas

You and me baby, making love like gorillas

[Live Verse]
Girl, let me take my time, take my time, take my time, babe

Once I lay besides you, girl, I will make you scream, "yeah, yeah"
Girl, let me take my time, take my time, take my time, babe

[Intro: Lupe Fiasco]
First rule, never let them change you
Rule two, do you to the fullest
And never be ashamed to
You're just good at what they cant do
And they hate that, they want to paint you
In they color, put you on another
But what they dont accept, and what they dont see
The best thing is what you already be

[Verse 1: Bruno Mars]
Oh her eyes, her eyes
Make the stars look like theyre not shining
Her hair, her hair
Falls perfectly without her trying
Shes so beautiful
And I tell her every day

Yeah I know, I know
When I compliment her, she won't believe me
And its so, its so
Sad to think she dont see what I see
But every time she asks me do I look okay, I say

[Chorus]
When I see your face
Theres not a thing that I would change
Cause youre amazing
Just the way you are
And when you smile
The whole world stops and stares for awhile
Cause girl youre amazing
Just the way you are

[Verse 2]
Her lips, her lips
I could kiss them all day if shed let me
Her laugh, her laugh
She hates but I think its so sexy
Shes so beautiful
And I tell her every day

Oh you know, you know, you know
Id never ask you to change
If perfect is what youre searching for
Then just stay the same
So dont even bother asking if you look okay
You know Ill say

[Chorus]
When I see your face
Theres not a thing that I would change
Cause youre amazing
Just the way you are
And when you smile
The whole world stops and stares for awhile
Cause girl youre amazing
Just the way you are

[Verse 3: Lupe Fiasco]
Uh yeah
The definition of real is
If you dont feel then you dont you feel it
Dont conceal it, dont be fair
You look great don't need silicone to build it/or botox to kill it
You just killing off spirit
And you the one that you gotta live with
So dont get caught up in appearance
And see the inner beauty
When you look off in the mirrors

[Bruno Mars]
The way you are
The way you are
Girl youre amazing
Just the way you are

[Chorus]
When I see your face
Theres not a thing that I would change
Cause youre amazing
Just the way you are
And when you smile
The whole world stops and stares for awhile
Cause girl youre amazing
Just the way you are

[Verse 1]
I got too many girls on hold for you to be so bold
Too many on my team for you to act so mean
You say you wanna go and have fun, well you ain't the only one
If I ring, don't let it ring too long or I'm gone

[Pre-Chorus]
I got Alicia waitin', Aisha waitin'
All the eesha's waitin' on me
So why you contemplatin'? Playa hatin'?
If this is how it's gonna be

[Chorus]
I'm calling all my lovelies 
'Cause I can't get a hold of you
Since you ain't thinking of me 
Oh, look what you're making me do

[Verse 2]
Honey pie, I'm far too fly to be on standby
Sendin' me straight to voicemail, suga, what the hell?
Oh, you ought to be ashamed, playin' these childish games
I don't get down like that, tell me where you at, hit me back

[Pre-Chorus]
I got Alicia waitin', Aisha waitin'
All the eesha's waitin' on me
So why you contemplatin'? Playa hatin'?
If this is how it's gonna be

[Chorus]
I'm calling all my lovelies 
'Cause I can't get a hold of you
Since you ain't thinking of me 
Oh, look what you're making me do

[Bridge]
Pick up the phone, pick up the phone
'Cause all this loving needs a home
Oh no, look at what you started, baby
Now I'm left here broken hearted, baby
There's a pain in my chest I cannot explain
I told myself I wasn't gon' cry
But somebody's gotta come dry these eyes 'cause

Hi, you've reached Halle Berry. Sorry I can't get to the phone right now but if you leave your name and number, I'll get right back to you

Damn...

[Chorus]
I'm calling calling calling calling all my lovelies
'Cause I can't get a hold of you
Oh, since you ain't thinking of me 
Look what you're making me do

[Outro]
Pick up the phone, pick up the phone
'Cause all this loving needs a home, oh

[Verse 1]
I spend all my money
On a big, old fancy car
For these bright-eyed honeys
Oh yeah, you know who you are
Keep me up 'til the sun is high
'Til the birds start calling my name
I'm addicted and I don't know why
Guess I've always been this way

[Pre-Chorus]
All these roads steer me wrong
But I still drive them all night long
All night long

[Chorus]
All you young, wild girls
You make a mess of me
Yeah, you young, wild girls
You'll be the death of me, the death of me
All you young, wild girls
No matter what you do
Yeah, you young, wild girls
I'll always come back to you, come back to you

[Verse 2]
I get lost under these lights
I get lost in the words I say
Start believing my own lies
Like everything will be okay
Oh I still dream of a simple life
Boy meets girl, makes her his wife
But love don't exist when you live like this
That much I know, yes I know

[Pre-Chorus]
All these roads steer me wrong
But I still drive them all night long
All night long

[Chorus]
All you young, wild girls
You make a mess of me
Yeah, you young, wild girls
You'll be the death of me, the death of me
All you young, wild girls
No matter what you do
Yeah, you young, wild girls
I'll always come back to you, come back to you

[Bridge]
You, you, you, you
Yeah you you you
You you you you

[Chorus]
All you young, wild girls
You make a mess of me
Yeah, you young, wild girls
You'll be the death of me, the death of me
All you young, wild girls
No matter what you do
Yeah, you young, wild girls
I'll always come back to you, come back to you

[Verse 1]
Girl I bet your momma named  you good lookin'
'Cause you sure look good to me
My attention, oh, yes, you just took it
You're probably the finest thing that I ever seen
And nobody at the party droppin' it low like the way that you do

[Pre-Chorus]
You got me sayin', "Damn girl, break it down for me"
Take it nice and slow, let me watch while you turn around
Just back it up on me girl, right now, right now

[Chorus]
I got your body rockin' side to side 
I put you on and now you're feelin' right 
I know exactly what is on your mind 
Oh baby we gon' have some fun tonight
Straight up and down

Straight up and down

Oh I know exactly what is on your mind
Oh baby we gon' have some fun tonight
Straight up and down

[Verse 2]
This liquor got both of us faded, so gone, so gone, so gone
But your booty deserve a celebration
And I'm gonna celebrate it all night long
Come on here and show me why you got the whole club starin' at you

[Pre-Chorus]
You got me sayin', "Damn girl, break it down for me"
Take it nice and slow, let me watch while you turn around
Just back it up on me girl, right now, right now

[Chorus]
I got your body rockin' side to side 
I put you on and now you're feelin' right 
I know exactly what is on your mind 
Oh baby we gon' have some fun tonight
Straight up and down

Straight up and down

Oh I know exactly what is on your mind
Oh baby we gon' have some fun tonight
Straight up and down

[Bridge]
Girl tell me when you're ready
Ready to go
Just say the word
And then we'll take this home
Don't you fight the feelin'
'Cause I feel it too
Freakin' me baby, while I'm freakin' you

[Chorus]
I got your body rockin' side to side 
I put you on and now you're feelin' right 
I know exactly what is on your mind 
Oh baby we gon' have some fun tonight
Straight up and down

Straight up and down

Oh I know exactly what is on your mind
Oh baby we gon' have some fun tonight
Straight up and down

[Intro: Damian Marley]
Now greetings to da world 
Vye here is da one called Bruno Mars 'long side gong to da zilla


[Verse 1: Bruno Mars]
Standing at this liquor store
Whiskey coming through my pores
Feeling like I run this whole block
Lotto tickets, cheap beer
That's why you can catch me here
Tryna scratch my way up to the top

[Pre-Chorus: Bruno Mars]
'Cause my job got me going nowhere
So I ain't got a thing to lose
Take me to a place where I don't care
This is me and my liquor store blues

[Chorus: Bruno Mars]
I'll take one shot for my pain
One drag for my sorrow
Get messed up today
I'll be okay tomorrow
One shot for my pain
One drag for my sorrow
Get messed up today
I'll be okay tomorrow

[Verse 2: Bruno Mars]
Me and my guitar, tonight
Singing to the city lights
Tryna leave with more than what I got
'Cause 68 cent just ain't gonna pay the rent
So I'll be out here 'til they call the cops

[Pre-Chorus: Bruno Mars]
'Cause my job got me going nowhere
So I ain't got a thing to lose
Take me to a place where I don't care
This is me and my liquor store blues

[Chorus: Bruno Mars]
I'll take one shot for my pain
One drag for my sorrow
Get messed up today
I'll be okay tomorrow
One shot for my pain
One drag for my sorrow
Get messed up today
I'll be okay tomorrow

[Verse 3: Damian Marley]
Here come Junior Gong
I'm flying high like Superman
And thinking that I run the whole block
I dunno if it's just because
Pineapple kush between my jaws
Has got me feeling like I'm on top
Feeling like I would stand up to de cops
And stand up to de bigga heads
Becaw de whole ah de ah saps
All de talk dem a talk
And dem fly make nah drop
Nuff ghetto youth cannot escape de trap

[Chorus: Bruno Mars]
Give me this one shot for my pain
One drag for my sorrow
Get messed up today
I'll be okay tomorrow
One shot for my pain
One drag for my sorrow
Get messed up today
I'll be okay tomorrow

[Outro Spoken: Damian Marley]
Now greetings to da world
Vyes to da one called Bruno Mars 'long side gong to da zilla
A.K.A. Damian junior gong Marley, yes sir
Ya best believe, ha ha 

[Verse 1]
Every day I wake up next to an angel
More beautiful than words could say
They said it wouldn't work but what did they know?
Cause years passed and we're still here today

Never in my dreams did I think that this would happen to me

[Chorus]
As I stand here before my woman
I cant fight back the tears in my eyes
Oh how could I be so lucky
I must've done something right
And I promise to love her for the rest of my life

[Verse 2]
Seems like yesterday when she first said hello
Funny how time flies by when you're in love
It took us a lifetime to find each other
It was worth the wait cause I finally found the one

Never in my dreams did I think that this would happen to me

[Chorus]
As I stand here before my woman
I cant fight back the tears in my eyes
Oh how could I be so lucky
I must've done something right
And I promise to love her for the rest of my life

[Verse 1]
Oh, oh, oh I, I was a city boy
Riding to dangers where I'd always run
A boy who had his fun
But I wouldn't have done
All the things that I have done
If I knew one day you'd come
Now baby  now baby 

[Verse 2]
Oh, oh, oh I, I know it breaks your heart
To picture the only one you want to love
In someone else's arms
But I wouldn't have done
All the things that I have done
If I knew one day you'd come
Now baby  now baby 

[Bridge]
Oh baby, please, let's leave the past behind us
Behind us
So that we can go where love will find us
Yeah, will find us
I know most girls would leave me
But I know that you believe me

[Verse 3]
Baby, I, I wish we were seventeen
So I could give you all the innocence
That you give to me
No, I wouldn't have done
All the things that I've done
If I knew one day you'd come
If I knew one day you'd come

[Intro]
Oh yes

[Verse 1]
Well, looky here, looky here
Ah, what do we have?
Another pretty thing ready for me to grab
But little does she know that I'm a wolf in sheep's clothing
'Cause at the end of the night, it is her I'll be holding

[Pre-Chorus]
I love you so
That's what you'll say
You'll tell me, "Baby, baby, please don't go away..."
But when I play, I never stay
So every girl that I meet, yeah, this is what I say

[Chorus]
Run, run, run away, run away, baby
Before I put my spell on you
You better get, get, get away, get away, darlin'
'Cause everything you heard is true
Your poor little heart will end up alone
'Cause Lord knows I'm a rollin' stone
So you better run, run, run away, run away, baby

[Verse 2]
Well, let me think, let me think
Ah, what should I do?
So many eager young bunnies that I'd like to pursue
Now even though they eating out the palm of my hand
There's only one carrot and they all gotta share it

[Pre-Chorus]
I love you so
That's what you'll say
You'll tell me, "Baby, baby, please don't go away..."
But when I play, I never stay
So every girl that I meet, yeah, this is what I say

[Chorus]
Run, run, run away, run away, baby
Before I put my spell on you
You better get, get, get away, get away, darlin'
'Cause everything you heard is true
Your poor little heart will end up alone
'Cause Lord knows I'm a rollin' stone
So you better run, run, run away, run away, baby

[Bridge]
See, I ain't trynna' hurt you, baby, no, no
No, I just wanna work you, baby, yup, yup
See, I ain't trynna' hurt you, baby, no, no
No, I just wanna work you, baby
If you scared you better run
 you better run
 you better run
You better, you better, you better

[Chorus]
Run, run, run away, run away, baby
Before I put my spell on you
You better get, get, get away, get away, darlin'
'Cause everything you heard is true
Your poor little heart will end up alone
'Cause Lord knows I'm a rollin' stone
So you better run, run, run away, run away, baby

[Verse 1]
Oh, I've never done this before
Never want to do this again
Wrong turn, on a dusty road
I did it to myself, I can't pretend
Well I learned just a little too late
Good God, I must have been blind
Cause she got me for everything
Everything, everything, alright
Like my daddy, I'm a gambling man
Never been afraid to roll the dice
But when I put my bet on her
Little Miss Snake Eyes ruined my life
She better sleep with one eye open
Better make sure to lock her doors
Cause once I get my hands on her, I'ma ooh

[Chorus]
Natalie, she ran away with all my money
And she did it for fun
Natalie, she's probably out there thinking it's funny
Telling everyone
Well, I'm digging a ditch for this gold digging bitch
Watch out, she's quick
Look out for a pretty little thing named Natalie
If you see her, tell her I'm coming
She better run

[Verse 2]
The good lord better bless your soul
Cause I done already cursed your name
Don't matter which way you go
Payback's gonna come your way
You'll be begging me, "Please, please, please"
And I'ma look at you and laugh, laugh, laugh
While you sit there and cry for me, cry for me
Cry for me all night
I'll spend a life time in jail

I'll be smiling in my cell

Can't nobody save you now
Sure there ain't no use in trying
Once I get my hands on you, I'ma ooh

[Chorus]
Natalie, she ran away with all my money
And she did it for fun
Natalie, she's probably out there thinking it's funny
Telling every one
Well, I'm digging a ditch for this gold digging bitch
Watch out, she's quick
Look out for a pretty little thing named Natalie
If you see her, tell her I'm coming
She better run

[Bridge]
I should've known better

Cause when we were together

She never said forever

I'm a fool that played in her game, hey!

[Chorus]
Natalie, she ran away with all my money
And she did it for fun
Natalie, she's probably out there thinking it's funny
Telling every one
Well, I'm digging a ditch for this gold digging bitch
Watch out, she's quick
Look out for a pretty little thing named Natalie
If you see her, tell her I'm coming
She better run

[Verse 1: Bruno Mars]
Truth of the matter is I'm complicated
You're as straight as they come
You go 'bout your day, baby
While I hide from the sun
It's better if you don't understand
Cause you won't know what it's like until you try

[Chorus: Bruno Mars]
You know I, I've been waiting on the other side
And you, all you gotta do is cross the line
I could wait a whole lifetime, but you just gotta decide
You know I, I've been waiting on the other
Waiting on the other side

[Verse 2: Cee-Lo Green]
We would live forever
Who could ask for more?
You could die if you wanted, but baby, what for?
It's better if you don't understand
And you won't know what it's like until you, try

[Chorus: Cee-Lo Green]
You know I, I've been waiting on the other side
And you, all you gotta do is cross the line
I could wait a whole lifetime, but you just gotta decide
You know I, I've been waiting on the other
Waiting on the other side

[Verse 3: B.o.B.]
If they say life's a dream, call this insomnia
Cause this ain't Wonderland, it damn sure ain't Narnia
And once you cross the line, you can't change your mind
Yeah, I'm a monster, but I'm no Frankenstein
And quite frankly, I've been feelin' insane in between my eyes
I really can't explain what I feel inside
If you knew what I was, you would run and hide
Many have tried to go into the night
Cross over the line, and come back alive
But that's the price we pay when we living on the other side

[Chorus: Bruno Mars]
You know I, I've been waiting on the other side
And you, all you gotta do is cross the line
I could wait a whole lifetime, but you just gotta decide
You know I, I've been waiting on the other
Waiting on the other side

[Outro: B.o.B]
It's better if you don't understand
It's better if you don't understand
It's better if you don't understand
It's better if you don't understand
It's better if you don't understand
It's better if you don't understand

[Verse 1]
I've been working hard so long
Seems like pain has been my only friend
My fragile heart's been done so wrong
I wondered if I'd ever heal again

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh just like all the seasons never stay the same
All around me I can feel a change 

[Chorus]
I will break these chains that bind me, happiness will find me
Leave the past behind me, today my life begins
A whole new world is waiting its mine for the taking
I know I can make it today my life begins

[Verse 2]
Yesterday has come and gone
And I've learn how to leave it where it is
And I see that I was wrong
For ever doubting I could win

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh just like all the seasons never stay the same
All around me I can feel a change 

[Chorus]
I will break these chains that bind me, happiness will find me
Leave the past behind me, today my life begins
A whole new world is waiting its mine for the taking
I know I can make it today my life begins

[Verse 3]
Life's too short to have regrets
So I'm learning now to leave it in the past and try to forget
Only have one life to live
So you better make the best of it

[Chorus]
I will break these chains that bind me, happiness will find me
Leave the past behind me, today my life begins
A whole new world is waiting its mine for the taking
I know I can make it today my life begins

[Chorus]
I will break these chains that bind me, happiness will find me
Leave the past behind me, today my life begins
A whole new world is waiting its mine for the taking
I know I can make it today my life begins

[Verse 1]
Hello
You know you look even better
Than the way you did the night before
And the moment that you kiss my lips
You know, I start to feel wonderful
It's something incredible
There's sex in your chemicals, oh
Ooh, let's go
You're the best way I know to escape the extraordinary
This world ain't for you
And I know for damn sure this world ain't for me
Lift off and say goodbye
Just let your fire set me free

[Chorus]
Oh, moonshine, take us to the stars tonight
Take us to that special place
That place we went the last time
The last time

[Verse 2]
I know
I was with you last night, but it feels like it's been so long
And everybody that's around
They notice that I'm not myself when you're gone
It's good to see you again
Good to see you again
On top of the world
Is where I stand when you're back in my life
Life's not so bad when you're way up this high
Everything is alright
Everything is alright

[Chorus]
Oh, moonshine, take us to the stars tonight
Take us to that special place
That place we went the last time
The last time
Oh, moonshine, your loving makes me come alive
Take us to that special place
That place we went the last time
The last time

[Bridge]
Don't look down, don't you ever look back
We are not afraid to die young and live fast
Give me good times, give me love, give me laughs
Let's take a ride to the sky before the night is gone

[Chorus]
Oh, moonshine, take us to the stars tonight
Take us to that special place
That place we went the last time
The last time
Oh, moonshine, your loving makes me come alive
Take us to that special place
That place we went the last time
The last time

[Verse 1: PARTYNEXTDOOR]
That thing go raw
That thing go raw
That's what you like I know, I know
Afterparties in the Hills, while you poppin' whoa
That's how it goes
Well let's hit Miami, Biscayne

Why, why, why?
So you can act a fool for the night
Oh that's right

[Verse 2: PARTYNEXTDOOR and Bruno Mars]
Tell me why your panties still on
Girl when Ginuwine's playing in the background
I would never make a promise that I can't keep
I'm tryna tell it to you gently
We 'gone do more than kick it, like Jet Li
But you 'gone cum before I do don't stress me
Asking if it's you , is it's me 
Say it's us  and I'll agree, baby

[Pre-Chorus: Bruno Mars and PARTYNEXTDOOR]

[Verse 1: Gucci Mane]
It's Gucci Mane and Bruno
That's one dynamic duo
A lot of women want me
But I'm in love with you though
Your ex is unimportant
That boy can't even afford it
I drive so many foreigns
Baby I should be deported

[Verse 2: Bruno Mars]
I got a condo in Manhattan
Baby girl, what's hatnin'?
You and your ass invited
So gon' and get to clappin'
So pop it for a player
Pop, pop it for me
Turn around and drop it for a player
Drop, drop it for me
I'll rent a beach house in Miami
Wake up with no jammies 
Lobster tail for dinner

You got it if you want it
Got, got it if you want it
Said you got it if you want it
Take my wallet if you want it now

Say the word and we go
You can be my freaka
Girl, I'll be a fleeko, mamacita
I will never make a promise that I can't keep
I promise that your smile ain't gon' never leave
Shopping sprees in Paris

Don't it feel good, baby?
Cause it's so brand new, babe
It's so brand new, baby

[Verse 1]
Na-na-na, here we are, here we are
In this big old empty room, staring at each other
Who's gonna make the first move?
Been doing our thing for a minute
And now both our hearts are in it
The only place to go is all the way

[Chorus]
Is that alright? Is that okay?
Girl, no need to be nervous
Cause I got you all night
Don't you worry about a thing, babe
Just go with it, go with it, go with it
And I will go real slow with it, slow with it
It's our first time
Go with it, go with it, go with it
And I will go real slow with it, slow with it
It's our first time

[Verse 2]
Clothes are not required
For what we got planned
Ooh, girl, you're my desire
Your wish is my command
Treat you like a princess
Ooh, girl, you're so delicious
Like ice cream on a sunny day
Gonna eat you before you melt away

[Chorus]
Is that alright? Is that okay?
Girl, no need to be nervous
Cause I got you all night
Don't you worry about a thing, babe
Just go with it, go with it, go with it
And I will go real slow with it, slow with it
It's our first time
Go with it, go with it, go with it
And I will go real slow with it, slow with it
It's our first time

[Intro]
This next song I'm about to do for y'all
Is a song that it means a lot to me

[Verse 1]
I will leave my heart at the door
I won't say a word
They've all been said before, you know
So why don't we just play pretend
Like we're not scared of what is coming next
Or scared of having nothing left?

[Pre-Chorus]
Look, don't get me wrong
I know there is no tomorrow
All I ask is

[Chorus]
If this is my last night with you
Hold me like I'm more than just a friend
Give me a memory I can use
Take me by the hand while we do what lovers do
It matters how this ends
Cause what if I never love again?

[Verse 2]
I don't need your honesty, it's already in your eyes
And I'm sure my eyes, they speak for me
No one knows me like you do
And since you're the only one that mattered
Tell me, who do I run to?

[Pre-Chorus]
Now, don't get me wrong
I know there is no tomorrow
All I ask is

[Chorus]
If this is my last night with you
You better hold me like I'm more than just a friend
Give me a memory I can use
Take me by the hand while we do what lovers do
It matters how this ends
Cause what if I never love again?

[Bridge]
Let this be our lesson in love
Let this be the way we remember us
I don't wanna be cruel or vicious
And I ain't asking for forgiveness
All I ask, all I ask is...

[Chorus]
If this is my last night with you
You better hold me like I'm more than just a friend
Give me a memory I can use
Take me by the hand while we do what lovers do
It matters how this ends
Cause what if I never love, never love
Never love, never love again?

[Outro]
We love you Adele
We love you BBC
Go pre-order the album right now
It's called '24k Magic'
I'm Bruno Mars
These are the Hooligans
Good night

[Verse 1: Pharrell]
Yuh, it's 4am and you are up getting fucked up
And what a world it is all girls, I'm in luck
Say hello to your sisters and let's try some yoga
I'm yoda, it's cold, but let's get it poppin' like soda
One will make a bridge and two will make a pose up
One will do the down dog and I will be the cobra
It's NERD where the party is never sorry, no, illa
I take'em to the head, now to the bed, said the red gorilla

[Verse 2: Bruno Mars]
Ooh I got a body full of liquor with a cocaine kicker and I'm feeling like I'm thirty feet tall
So lay it down, lay it down!
You got your legs up in the sky with the devil in your eyes, let me hear you say you want it all
Say it now, say it now!

[Pre-Chorus: Bruno Mars]
Look what you're doing, look what you've done
But in this jungle you can't run
Cause what I got for you
I promise it's a killa
You'll be banging on my chest, bang bang; gorilla

[Chorus: Bruno Mars]
Ooh, yeah
You and me baby making love like gorillas
Ooh, yeah
You and me baby making love like gorillas]

[Verse 3: R. Kelly]
I'm like a anaconda in your garden
Baby girl, I'm explorin'
Deep down in your forest like

Hey, we got it hotter than an amazon
Gotcha cheetah bra with your heels on
And I'm about to be the king of your jungle like

[Pre-Chorus: R. Kelly]
Hey, it's like a rain forest, baby, how I got your love pouring down

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
And I don't mind when we fall out
As long as we fall back into it
I hope we never put an end to it
Even though you not that into it
Heaven, have you ever been to it?
Cause you look like you never been
You're more of a Hell's Angel
And for you, I'd rather sin
Broken heart, love you with a broken heart
For you I'd jump off Noah's arc
Love is blind and hope is dark
Why does pain feel so good?
Love is science live for you
Die for you, and I'll die smiling

[Verse 2: Bruno Mars]
Easy come, easy go, that's just how you live
Oh, take, take, take it all but you never give
Should've known you was trouble from the first kiss
Had your eyes wide open, why were they open?
Gave you all I had and you tossed it in the trash
You tossed it in the trash, you did
To give me all your love is all I ever asked
Cause what you don't understand is

[Hook: Bruno Mars]
I'd catch a grenade for you, throw my hand on a blade for you
I'd jump in front of a train for you, you know I'd do anything for ya
I would go through all this pain
Take a bullet straight through my brain
Yes, I would die for you, baby, but you won't do the same
No, no, no, no

[Verse 3: Bruno Mars]
Black, black, black and blue, beat me 'til I'm numb
Tell the devil I said, hey, when you get back to where you're from
Mad woman, bad woman, that's just what you are, yeah
You'll smile in my face then rip the brakes out my car
Gave you all I had and you tossed it in the trash
You tossed it in the trash, yes, you did
To give me all your love is all I ever asked
Cause what you don't understand is

[Hook]

[Bridge: Bruno Mars]
If my body was on fire
Ooh, you'd watch me burn down in flames
You said you loved me, you're a liar
Cause you never, ever, ever did, baby

But darling
[Hook]

[Intro]
Oh yeah, oh yeah
Baby, here we are again, ooh

[Verse 1]
I can see it in your eyes, you want a good time
You wanna put your body on mine
Alright, but don't change your mind
Don't you change it, oh no
Oh yeah, you called me today
Drove all this way, so don't let this buzz go to waste, oh no
Your pleasure, pleasure island is where we can go

[Pre-Chorus]
No, I won't think you're easy, no, I won't think you're fast
Your eyes say amazing, but your lips came to ask
No need to fight it, when you know it feels alright
You say you're a woman who knows what she likes

[Chorus]
Then show me, you got to, you got to show me
You tell me all day that you're lonely
But show me, show me, show me tonight, yeah
Girl, show me, you got to, you got to show me
You tell me all day that you're lonely
But show me, show me, show me tonight, yeah

[Verse 2]
Love the way that you laugh, the way that you smile
Makes me feel like you've been waiting a while
But guess what darling? I've been waiting too
So let's grind, we can get freaky tonight
Right is your ticket to ride
Tell me girl what you gon' do

[Pre-Chorus]
No, I won't think you're easy, no, I won't think you're fast
Your eyes say amazing, but your lips came to ask
No need to fight it, when you know it feels alright
You say you're a woman who knows what she likes

[Chorus]
Then show me, you got to, you got to show me
You tell me all day that you're lonely
But show me, show me, show me tonight, yeah
Girl, show me, you got to, you got to show me
You tell me all day that you're lonely
But show me, show me, show me tonight, yeah

[Bridge]
It's getting freaky in this room, room, room
Now let me hear you say you want that boom, boom, boom
We can take it slow, we can zoom, zoom, zoom
Baby, if you're ready for that uh-uh-uh
It's getting freaky in this room, room, room
Now let me hear you say you want that boom, boom, boom
We can take it slow, we can zoom, zoom, zoom
Baby, if you're ready for that uh-uh-uh

[Chorus]
Then show me, you got to, you got to show me
You tell me all day that you're lonely
But show me, show me, show me tonight, yeah
Girl, show me, you got to, you got to show me
You tell me all day that you're lonely
But show me, show me, show me tonight, yeah

[Chorus]
She was covered in leather and gold
21 years old
I lost her in the cold
It's unfair she's out there
Somewhere, somewhere, somewhere in Brooklyn
She's somewhere, somewhere, somewhere in Brooklyn

[Verse 1]
Little Ms. Perfect
Sittin' at the train stop
Red Nike high tops
Listenin' to hip-hop
While we were waitin'
Started conversatin'
Before I got her name
Along came a train

[Pre-Chorus]
Ooh
Next stop Brooklyn
Ooh
Now I'm looking

[Chorus]
She was covered in leather and gold
21 years old
I lost her in the cold
It's unfair she's out there
Somewhere, somewhere, somewhere in Brooklyn
She's somewhere, somewhere, somewhere in Brooklyn

[Verse 2]
On the street kickin' rocks
Circlin' the same block
Greenpoint to Flatbush
Checkin' every corner shop
Tappin' people's shoulders
Askin' if they know her
Every days the same
It's back to the train

[Pre-Chorus]
Ooh
Next stop Brooklyn
Ooh
I'm still lookin'

[Chorus]
She was covered in leather and gold
21 years old
I lost her in the cold
It's unfair she's out there
Somewhere, somewhere, somewhere in Brooklyn
She's somewhere, somewhere, somewhere in Brooklyn

[Outro]
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, I wonder will we ever meet again?
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Ooh, I wonder will we ever meet again?
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Yeah, I wonder if we'll ever meet again
Oh, oh, oh, oh
I hope we do
Somewhere in Brooklyn[Instrumental break]

[Verse 1]
All you 'get back, coming to the stage'
Is a girl who's new in town
She go by the name 'Where Your Stacks At?'
This pretty little thing, I swear, won't let you down
Watch her drop it like,  hey!

[Chorus]
Oh, it's not complicated, so this won't take a while
You see, music make her dance
And money, money, money make her smile

Money, money, money make her smile

Money, money, money make her smile

[Verse 2]
She's a super freak
You wouldn't know it if you saw her outside these velvet walls
No, she don't go where preachers preach
She only go to the church where dollars fall
Watch her drop it like,  hey!

[Chorus]
Oh, it's not complicated, so this won't take a while
You see, music make her dance
And money, money, money make her smile

Money, money, money make her smile

Money, money, money make her smile

[Breakdown]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Watch her


[Chorus]
Oh, it's not complicated, so this won't take a while
You see, music make her dance
And money, money, money make her smile

Money, money, money make her smile

Money, money, money make her smile

[Intro]
One, one, one, one, one

[Verse 1]
Talkin' in my sleep at night, makin' myself crazy

Wrote it down and read it out, hopin' it would save me


[Refrain]
My love, he makes me feel like nobody else, nobody else
But my love, he doesn't love me, so I tell myself, I tell myself

[Pre-Chorus]
One: Don't pick up the phone
You know he's only callin' 'cause he's drunk and alone
Two: Don't let him in
You'll have to kick him out again
Three: Don't be his friend
You know you're gonna wake up in his bed in the morning
And if you're under him, you ain't gettin' over him

[Chorus]
I got new rules, I count 'em
I got new rules, I count 'em
I gotta tell them to myself
I got new rules, I count 'em
I gotta tell them to myself

[Verse 2]
I keep pushin' forwards, but he keeps pullin' me backwards


Now I'm standin' back from it, I finally see the pattern


[Refrain]
But my love, he doesn't love me, so I tell myself, I tell myself
I do, I do, I do

One: Don't pick up the phone
You know he's only callin' 'cause he's drunk and alone

You know you're gonna wake up in his bed in the morning
And if you're under him, you ain't gettin' over him

I got new rules, I count 'em
I got new rules, I count 'em
I gotta tell them to myself
I got new rules, I count 'em
I gotta tell them to myself

[Bridge]
Practice makes perfect
I'm still tryna learn it by heart 
Eat, sleep, and breathe it
Rehearse and repeat it, 'cause I 

[Pre-Chorus]
One: Don't pick up the phone 
You know he's only callin' 'cause he's drunk and alone 
Two: Don't let him in 
You'll have to kick him out again 
Three: Don't be his friend
You know you're gonna wake up in his bed in the morning
And if you're under him, you ain't gettin' over him

I gotta tell them to myself
I got new rules, I count 'em

I gotta tell them to myself

[Outro]
Don't let him in, don't let him in
Don't, don't, don't, don't
Don't be his friend, don't be his friend
Don't, don't, don't, don't
Don't let him in, don't let him in
Don't, don't, don't, don't
Don't be his friend, don't be his friend
Don't, don't, don't, don't
You're gettin' over him

[Intro]
If you don't wanna see me

[Verse 1]
Did a full 180, crazy
Thinking 'bout the way I was
Did the heartbreak change me? Maybe
But look at where I ended up
I'm all good already
So moved on, it's scary
I'm not where you left me at all, so

[Pre-Chorus]
If you don't wanna see me dancing with somebody
If you wanna believe that anything could stop me

[Chorus]
Don't show up, don't come out
Don't start caring about me now
Walk away, you know how
Don't start caring about me now

[Verse 2]
Aren't you the guy who tried to
Hurt me with the word "goodbye"?
Though it took some time to survive you
I'm better on the other side
I'm all good already
So moved on, it's scary
I'm not where you left me at all, so

[Pre-Chorus]
If you don't wanna see me dancing with somebody
If you wanna believe that anything could stop me


[Chorus]
Don't show up, don't come out
Don't start caring about me now
Walk away, you know how
Don't start caring about me now 

[Bridge]
Up, up
Don't come out, out, out
Don't show up, up, up
Don't start now 
Up, up
Don't come out, out
I'm not where you left me at all, so

[Pre-Chorus]
If you don't wanna see me dancing with somebody
If you wanna believe that anything could stop me

[Chorus]
Don't show up , don't come out 
Don't start caring about me now 
Walk away , you know how 
Don't start caring about me now 

[Outro]
Up, up
Don't come out, out, out
Don't show up, up, up
Walk away, walk away 
Up, up
Don't come out, out, out
Don't show up, up, up
Walk away, walk away, oh

[Verse 1]
You call me all friendly
Tellin' me how much you miss me
That's funny, I guess you've heard my songs
Well, I'm too busy for your business
Go find a girl who wants to listen
'Cause if you think I was born yesterday, you have got me wrong

[Pre-Chorus]
So I cut you off
I don't need your love
'Cause I already cried enough
I've been done
I've been movin' on since we said goodbye
I cut you off
I don't need your love
So you can try all you want
Your time is up, I'll tell you why

[Chorus]
You say you're sorry, but it's too late now
So save it, get gone, shut up
'Cause if you think I care about you now
Well, boy, I don't give a fuck

[Verse 2]
I remember that weekend
When my best friend caught you creepin'
You blamed it all on the alcohol
So, I made my decision
'Cause you made your bed, sleep in it
Play the victim and switch your position
I'm through, I'm done

[Pre-Chorus]
So I cut you off
I don't need your love
'Cause I already cried enough
I've been done
I've been movin' on since we said goodbye
I cut you off
I don't need your love
So you can try all you want
Your time is up, I'll tell you why

[Chorus]
You say you're sorry, but it's too late now
So save it, get gone, shut up
'Cause if you think I care about you now
Well, boy, I don't give a fuck

[Post-Chorus]
I see you tryna get to me
I see you beggin' on your knees
Boy, I don't give a fuck
So stop tryna get to me
Tch, get up off your knees
'Cause, boy, I don't give a fuck

[Bridge]
About you
No, I don't give a damn
You keep reminiscin' on when you were my man
But I'm over you
Now you're all in the past
You talk all that sweet talk, but I ain't comin' back

[Breakdown]
Cut you off
I don't need your love
So you can try all you want
Your time is up, I'll tell you why
I'll tell you why

[Chorus]
You say you're sorry, but it's too late now
So save it, get gone, shut up

'Cause if you think I care about you now
Well, boy, I don't give a fuck


[Post-Chorus]
I see you tryna get to me
I see you beggin' on your knees
Boy, I don't give a fuck
So stop tryna get to me 
Tch, get up off your knees
'Cause, boy, I don't give a fuck

[Verse 1]
I know it's hot
I know we've got
Something that money can't buy
Fighting in fits
Biting your lip
Loving 'til late in the night

[Pre-Chorus]
Tell me I'm too crazy
You can't tame me, can't tame me
Tell me I have changed
But I'm the same me, old same me
Inside
Hey!

[Chorus]
If you don't like the way I talk, then why am I on your mind?
If you don't like the way I rock, then finish your glass of wine
We fight and we argue, you'll still love me blind
If we don't fuck this whole thing up
Guaranteed, I can blow your mind
Mwah!

[Post-Chorus]
And tonight I'm alive, ain't no dollar sign
Guaranteed, I can blow your mind, mwah
And tonight I'm alive, ain't no dollar sign
Guaranteed, I can blow your mind, mwah


[Verse 2]
Yeah, I'm so bad
Best that you've had
I guess you're diggin' the show
Open the door
You want some more
When you wanna leave, let me know

[Pre-Chorus]
Tell me I'm too crazy
You can't tame me, can't tame me
Tell me I have changed
But I'm the same me, old same me
Inside
Hey!

[Chorus]
If you don't like the way I talk, then why am I on your mind?
If you don't like the way I rock, then finish your glass of wine
We fight and we argue, you'll still love me blind
If we don't fuck this whole thing up
Guaranteed, I can blow your mind
Mwah!

[Post-Chorus]
And tonight I'm alive, ain't no dollar sign
Guaranteed, I can blow your mind, mwah
And tonight I'm alive, ain't no dollar sign
Guaranteed, I can blow your mind, mwah

[Breakdown]
And tonight I'm alive, ain't no dollar sign
Guaranteed, I can blow your mind, mwah, hey!
And tonight I'm alive, ain't no dollar sign
Guaranteed I can blow your mind, hey!

[Pre-Chorus]
Tell me I'm too crazy
You can't tame me, can't tame me
Tell me I have changed
But I'm the same me, old same me
Inside
Hey!
Mwah!

[Chorus]
If you don't like the way I talk, then why am I on your mind?
If you don't like the way I rock, then finish your glass of wine
We fight and we argue, you'll still love me blind
If we don't fuck this whole thing up

[Verse 1]
I see the moon, I see the moon, I see the moon
Oh, when you're looking at the sun
I'm not a fool, I'm not a fool, not a fool
No, you're not fooling anyone

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, but when you're gone
When you're gone, when you're gone
Oh baby, all the lights go out
Thinking, oh that, baby, I was wrong
I was wrong, I was wrong
Come back to me, baby, we can work this out

[Chorus]
Oh baby, come on, let me get to know you
Just another chance so that I can show
That I won't let you down and run
No, I won't let you down and run
'Cause I could be the one
I could be the one
I could be the one
I could be the one

[Verse 2]
I see in blue, I see in blue, I see in blue
Oh, when you see everything in red
There is nothing that I wouldn't do for you
Do for you, do for you
Oh, 'cause you got inside my head

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, but when you're gone
When you're gone, when you're gone
Oh baby, all the lights go out
Thinking, oh that, baby, I was wrong
I was wrong, I was wrong
Come back to me, baby, we can work this out

[Chorus]
Oh baby, come on, let me get to know you
Just another chance so that I can show
That I won't let you down and run
No, I won't let you down and run
'Cause I could be the one
I could be the one
I could be the one

[Bridge]
Be the one, be the one, be the one
Be the one, be the one, be the one
I could be the one
Be the one, be the one, be the one
Be the one, be the one, be the one
I could be the one
Be the one, be the one, be the one
Be the one, be the one, be the one
I could be the one
Be the one, be the one, be the one
Be the one, be the one, be the one
Will you be mine?

[Chorus]
Oh baby, come on, let me get to know you
Just another chance so that I can show
That I won't let you down and run
No, I won't let you down and run
'Cause I could be the one
I could be the one
I could be the one

[Verse 1]
I've always been the one to say the first goodbye
Had to love and lose ahundredmillion times
Had toget it wrong to know justwhat I like
Now I'm falling
You say my name like I have never heard before
I'm indecisive, but, this time, I know for sure
I hope I'm not the only one that feels it all
Are you falling?

[Pre-Chorus]
Centre of attention
You know you can get whatever you want from me
Whenever you want it, baby
It's you in my reflection
I'm afraid of all the things it could do to me
If I would've known it, baby

[Chorus]
I would've stayed at home
'Cause I was doing better alone
But when you said, "Hello"
I knew that was the end of it all
I should've stayed at home
'Cause now there ain't no letting you go
Am I falling in love with the one that could break my heart?
Oh no, I was doing better alone
But when you said, "Hello"
I knew that was the end of it all
I should've stayed at home
'Cause now there ain't no letting you go
Am I falling in love with the one that could break my heart?

[Verse 2]
I wonder, when you go, if I stay on your mind
Two can play that game, but you win me every time
Everyone before you was a waste of time
Yeah, you got me

[Pre-Chorus]
Centre of attention
You know you can get whatever you want from me
Whenever you want it, baby
It's you in my reflection
I'm afraid of all the things it could do to me
If I would've known it, baby

[Chorus]
I would've stayed at home
'Cause I was doing better alone
But when you said, "Hello"
I knew that was the end of it all
I should've stayed at home 
'Cause now there ain't no letting you go
Am I falling in love with the one that could break my heart?
Oh no, I was doing better alone
But when you said, "Hello"
I knew that was the end of it all
I should've stayed at home
'Cause now there ain't no letting you go
Am I falling in love with the one that could break my heart?

[Bridge]
Ooh, break my heart
Ooh, break my heart
Ooh
Am I falling in love with the one that could break my heart?

[Chorus]
I would've stayed at home
'Cause I was doing better alone
But when you said, "Hello"
I knew that was the end of it all
I should've stayed at home 
'Cause now there ain't no letting you go
Am I falling in love with the one that could break my heart?
Oh no , I was doing better alone
But when you said, "Hello"
I knew that was the end of it all
I should've stayed at home
'Cause now there ain't no letting you go
Am I falling in love with the one that could break my heart?

[Verse 1: Dua Lipa]
Here, where the sky's falling
I'm covered in blue
I'm running and I'm crawling
Fighting for you
When the rain stops, then, darling, what will I do?
And I know I go all in, but why do I?

[Chorus: Dua Lipa]
You give me a reason, something to believe in
I know, I know, I know
You give me a meaning, something I can breathe in
I know, I know, I know
It's a bittersweet feeling
Longing, and I'm leaving
I go, I go, I go
But I wish I was there with you
Oh, I wish I was there with you

[Verse 2: Dua Lipa & Chris Martin]
There's a crack in my window
A bird in my room
Angels all over that watch over you
When I'm walking on water
All my dreams have come true
Still, nothing means nothing
Without you, you

[Chorus: Dua Lipa & Chris Martin]
You give me a reason, something to believe in
I know, I know, I know
You give me a meaning, something I can breathe in
I know, I know, I know
It's a bittersweet feeling
Longing, and I'm leaving
I go, I go, I go
Tell my heart to lie, but I know deep inside it's true
That I wish I was there with you
That I wish I was there with you
Oh, I wish I was there with you

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus: Dua Lipa & Chris Martin]
You give me a reason, something to believe in
I know, I know, I know
You give me a meaning, something I can breathe in
I know, I know, I know
It's a bittersweet feeling
Longing, and I'm leaving
I go, I go, I go
Tell my heart to lie, but I know deep inside it's true
That I wish I was there with you
That I wish I was there with you
Oh, I wish I was there with you

[Intro]
Ah yeah
Ah yeah

[Verse 1]
He calls me the devil
I make him wanna sin
Every time I knock, he can't help but let me in
Must be homesick for the real
I'm the realest it gets
You probably still adore me
With my hands around your neck

[Pre-Chorus]
Can you feel the warmth? Yeah
As my kiss goes down you like some sweet alcohol
Where I'm coming from, yeah
It's the darker side of me that makes you feel so numb

[Chorus]
'Cause Im hot like hell
Does it burn when I'm not there?
And you're by yourself
Am I the answer to your prayers?
I'm giving you that pleasure heaven
And I'll give it to you
Hotter than hell
Hotter than hell

[Verse 2]
You're my manna from heaven
We all gotta get fed
Cant let me know I'm wanted
Cant let me in your head
I'm not here to make you kneel
But it's praise that I get
You ain't gonna walk free boy
Not finished with you yet, no

[Pre-Chorus]
Can you feel the warmth? Yeah
As my kiss goes down you like some sweet alcohol
Where Im coming from, yeah
It's the darker side of me that makes you feel so numb

[Chorus]
'Cause I'm hot like hell
Does it burn when I'm not there?
And you're by yourself
Am I the answer to your prayers?
I'm giving you that pleasure heaven
And I'll give it to you
Hotter than hell
Hotter than hell

[Bridge]
Oh, you're down right there
You make me feel right there
When you lay me down right there
We just make it right there
'Cause you're looking so right there
Baby, you should touch me right there
If you take me right there
We could make it

[Chorus]
'Cause I'm hot like hell
Does it burn when I'm not there?
And you're by yourself
Am I the answer to your prayers?
I'm giving you that pleasure heaven
And I'll give it to you
Hotter than hell
Hotter than hell
Hotter than hell
Hotter than hell
And I'll give it to you
Hotter than hell

[Verse 1]
Common love isn't for us
We created something phenomenal
Don't you agree?
Don't you agree?
You got me feelingdiamondrich
Nothing on thisplanet compares to it
Don't you agree?
Don'tyou agree?

[Pre-Chorus]
Who needs to go to sleep when I got you next to me?

[Chorus]
All night, I'll riot with you
I know you got my back and you know I got you
So come on , come on , come on 
Let's get physical
Lights out, follow the noise
Baby, keep on dancing like you ain't got a choice
So come on , come on , come on
Let's get physical

[Verse 2]
Adrenaline keeps on rushing in
Love the simulation we're dreaming in
Don't you agree?
Don't you agree?
I don't wanna live another life
'Cause this one's pretty nice
Living it up

[Pre-Chorus]
Who needs to go to sleep when I got you next to me?

[Chorus]
All night, I'll riot with you
I know you got my back and you know I got you
So come on , come on , come on 
Let's get physical
Lights out, follow the noise
Baby, keep on dancing like you ain't got a choice
So come on , come on , come on
Let's get physical

[Bridge]
Hold on just a little tighter
Come on, hold on, tell me if you're ready
Come on 
Baby, keep on dancing
Let's get physical
Hold on just a little tighter
Come on, hold on, tell me if you're ready
Come on 
Baby, keep on dancing
Let's get physical

[Chorus]
All night, I'll riot with you
I know you got my back and you know I got you
So come on, come on, come on
Let's get physical
Lights out, follow the noise
Baby, keep on dancing like you ain't got a choice
So come on , come on , come on
Let's get physical 

[Outro]
Let's get physical 
Physical 
Let's get physical 
Come on, phy-phy-phy-physical

[Verse 1]
3 A.M. and my neighbors hate me
Music blasting, shaking these walls
This time Mary Jane won't save me
I've been working later, I've been drinking stronger
I've been smoking deeper but the memories won't stop

[Chorus]
I can't stop thinking 'bout you
I can't stop thinking 'bout you
I can't get high, I can't get by, I can't get through
I can't stop thinking 'bout you

[Verse 2]
Like poison coursing through me
So clear my vision is blurred
The haze won't put my mind at ease
I've been sleeping later, I've been breathing stronger
I've been digging deeper, but the memories won't stop

[Chorus]
I can't stop thinking 'bout you
I can't stop thinking 'bout you
I can't get high, I can't get by, I can't get through
I can't stop thinking 'bout you

[Bridge]
I want you all
Say it before you run out of time
I want you all
Say it before it's too late
I want you all
Say what I am feeling now
I want you all
Waiting is insane

[Chorus]
I can't stop thinking 'bout you
I can't stop thinking 'bout you
I can't get high, I can't get by, I can't get through
I can't stop thinking 'bout you
I can't stop thinking 'bout you
I can't get high, I can't get by, I can't get through
I can't stop thinking 'bout you

[Verse 1]
In the beginning, God created Heaven and Earth
For what it's worth, I think that He might've created you first
Just my opinion
Your body is the one paradise that I wanna fly to
Every day and every night

[Pre-Chorus]
I've been sick and tired of running
Chasing all of the flashing lights
These late nights don't mean nothing
So I just wanna apologize
I'm sorry, so sorry
I'm sorry, yeah

[Chorus]
I need your love
And I'm dying for the rush
'Cause my heart ain't got enough
I need your touch
This is getting serious
Tell me that it's not the end of us
How can we go back to the beginning?
How can we go back to the beginning?
Without you, I've got no air to breathe in
How can we go back to the beginning?

[Verse 2]
Don't matter what's written
We can start all over again, all over again
Oh, how can I get you all over my skin?
My deep intuition tells me that I'm doing you wrong
If I don't come home
Just say you forgive me and don't let me go

[Pre-Chorus]
I've been sick and tired of running
Chasing all of the flashing lights
These late nights don't mean nothing
So I just wanna apologize
I'm sorry, so sorry
I'm sorry, yeah

[Chorus]
I need your love
And I'm dying for the rush
'Cause my heart ain't got enough
I need your touch
This is getting serious
Tell me that it's not the end of us
How can we go back to the beginning?
How can we go back to the beginning?
Without you, I've got no air to breathe in
How can we go back to the beginning?

[Bridge]
You know
I'll roar like a lion for you
You know I'll keep trying
'Til the sun starts rising

[Chorus]
I need your love
And I'm dying for the rush
'Cause my heart ain't got enough
I need your touch
This is getting serious
Tell me that it's not the end of us
How can we go back to the beginning?
How can we go back to the beginning?
Without you, I've got no air to breathe in
How can we go back to the beginning?

[Verse 1: Dua Lipa]
Over and over
Waves of frightening feelings
Floating, weightless, I'm willing
My will keeps bending and breaking, honey

[Pre-Chorus: Dua Lipa]
Hold me, trust me
Let me ride in your love all night, babe
Hold me, touch me
I wanna die in your love all night, babe

[Chorus: Dua Lipa]
Lost in your light, baby
I wanna stay right here all night, baby
Let's get lost in the light, baby
I wanna stay right here all night, baby

[Verse 2: Miguel]
Oh, now everything's vivid, vivid
Torture tempted with pleasure
I'm reckless, tangled, suspended
You want it all, nothing's wasted, woman

[Pre-Chorus: Both & Miguel]
Hold me, trust me
You know you can hide in my arms all night now
Hold me, trust me
I'm gonna ride in your love all night
I'm

[Chorus: Both & Miguel]
Lost in your light, baby 
I wanna stay right here all night, baby 
Let's get lost in the light, baby 
I wanna stay right here all night, baby


[Bridge: Both & Miguel]
Midnight, your eyes
Bitter wine, conversations
You and me, some money, babe
I don't need a paycheck 
One taste and I'm hooked on it
Don't lie, I know you want it
I'm addicted to your light

[Chorus: Dua Lipa & Miguel & Both]
Lost in your light, baby
I wanna stay right here all night, baby

Let's get lost in the light, baby 
I wanna stay right here all night, baby

Let's get lost in the light, baby

[Verse 1]
It's second nature to walk home before the sun goes down
And put your keys betweenyourknuckles when there'sboys around
Isn't it funny how welaugh it off to hide our fear
When there's nothing funny here? 
Sick intuition that they taught us, so we won't freak out
We hide our figures, doing anything to shut their mouths
We smile away to ease the tension so it don't go south
But there's nothing funny now 

[Pre-Chorus]
When will we stop saying things?
'Cause they're all listening
No, the kids ain't alright
Oh, and they do what they see
'Cause it's all on TV
Oh, the kids ain't alright

[Chorus]
Boys will be, boys will be
Boys will be, boys will be boys
But girls will be women
Boys will be, boys will be
Boys will be, boys will be boys
But girls will be women

[Verse 2]
I'm sure if there's something that I can't find the words to say
I know that there will be a man around to save the day
And that was sarcasm, in case you needed it mansplained
I should've stuck to ballet 

[Pre-Chorus]
When will we stop saying things?
'Cause they're all listening
No, the kids ain't alright
Oh, and they do what they see
'Cause it's all on TV
Oh, the kids ain't alright

[Chorus]
Boys will be, boys will be
Boys will be, boys will be boys
But girls will be women
Boys will be, boys will be
Boys will be, boys will be boys
But girls will be women

[Bridge]
If you're offended by this song
You're clearly doing something wrong
If you're offended by this song
Then you're probably saying
Boys will be, boys will be
Boys will be, boys will be boys
But girls will be women

[Pre-Chorus]
When will we stop saying things?
'Cause they're all listening
No, the kids ain't alright
Oh, and they do what they see
'Cause it's all on TV
Oh, the kids ain't alright

[Chorus]
Boys will be, boys will be
Boys will be, boys will be boys
But girls will be women
Boys will be, boys will be
Boys will be, boys will be boys
But girls will be women

[Verse 1]
If you wanna run away with me, I know a galaxy
And I can take youfora ride
I hada premonition that we fell intoa rhythm
Where the music don't stop for life
Glitter in the sky, glitter in my eyes
Shining just the way I like
If you're feeling like you need a little bit of company
You met me at the perfect time

[Pre-Chorus]
You want me, I want you, baby
My sugarboo, I'm levitating
The Milky Way, we're renegading
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Chorus]
I got you, moonlight, you're my starlight
I need you all night, come on, dance with me
I'm levitating
You, moonlight, you're my starlight 
I need you all night, come on, dance with me
I'm levitating

[Verse 2]
I believe that you're for me, I feel it in our energy
I see us written in the stars
We can go wherever, so let's do it now or never
Baby, nothing's ever, ever too far
Glitter in the sky, glitter in our eyes
Shining just the way we are
I feel like we're forever every time we get together
But whatever, let's get lost on Mars

[Pre-Chorus]
You want me, I want you, baby
My sugarboo, I'm levitating
The Milky Way, we're renegading
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Chorus]
I got you, moonlight, you're my starlight
I need you all night, come on, dance with me
I'm levitating
You, moonlight, you're my starlight 
I need you all night, come on, dance with me
I'm levitating

[Post-Chorus]
You can fly away with me tonight
You can fly away with me tonight
Baby, let me take you for a ride
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I'm levitating 
You can fly away with me tonight
You can fly away with me tonight
Baby, let me take you for a ride
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah 

[Bridge]
My love is like a rocket, watch it blast off
And I'm feeling so electric, dance my ass off
And even if I wanted to, I can't stop
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
My love is like a rocket, watch it blast off
And I'm feeling so electric, dance my ass off
And even if I wanted to, I can't stop
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
You want me, I want you, baby
My sugarboo, I'm levitating
The Milky Way, we're renegading

[Chorus]
I got you , moonlight, you're my starlight
I need you all night , come on, dance with me
I'm levitating 

[Post-Chorus]
You can fly away with me tonight 
You can fly away with me tonight
Baby, let me take you for a ride
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah 
I'm levitating 
You can fly away with me tonight 
You can fly away with me tonight
Baby, let me take you for a ride
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah 

[Chorus]
I got you, moonlight, you're my starlight 
I need you all night, come on, dance with me 
I'm levitating
You, moonlight, you're my starlight 
I need you all night, come on, dance with me
I'm levitating

[Verse 1]
I, I can't lie, I'm scared to open my eyes
'Cause what if I find nothing at all, nothing at all?
What is the point of my lips if they don't make noise? Oh
What is the point of doing nothing at all, watching it fall?

[Pre-Chorus]
The flicker burning, you know the time is running, running out
Only I see, oh, the diamonds, diamonds breaking down
I won't stay quiet, I won't stay quiet
'Cause staying silent's the same as dying
I won't stay quiet, the flicker's burning now

[Chorus]
This is not a, this is not a swan, swan song
This is not a, this is not a swan, swan song
We just gotta, we just gotta hold on tonight
This is not a, this is not a swan song, swan song, swan dive
Yeah, it's a new life

[Verse 2]
Real fantasy, wishing it was make-believe, oh
What is the reason of doing nothing at all, watching it fall?

[Pre-Chorus]
The flicker burning, you know the time is running, running out
Only I see, oh, the diamonds, diamonds breaking down
I won't stay quiet, I won't stay quiet
'Cause staying silent's the same as dying
I won't stay quiet, the flicker's burning now

[Chorus]
This is not a, this is not a swan, swan song
This is not a, this is not a swan, swan song
We just gotta, we just gotta hold on tonight
This is not a, this is not a swan song, swan song, swan dive
Yeah, it's a new life

[Bridge]
Tread heavily around me
Tread heavily around me
Tread heavily
Tread heavily around me
Tread heavily, tread

[Chorus]
This is not a, this is not a
Swan , swan song 
This is not a, this is not a
Swan , swan song 
We just gotta, we just gotta hold on tonight 
This is not a, this is not a swan song, swan song, swan dive
Yeah, it's a new life

[Outro]
It's a new life

[Intro: Take A Daytrip]


[Verse 1]
Yeah, let's get to the point here
You love to disappoint me, don't ya?
You tell mewhatI want, butain't no follow through
You don't followthrough, no
But if you only knew me
The way you know my body, baby
Then I think maybe we could probably see this through
We could make it through, but

[Pre-Chorus]
I've been thinking it'd be better
If we didn't know each other
Then you go and make me feel okay
Got me thinking it'd be better
If we didn't stay together
Then you put your hands up on my waist

[Chorus]
I know it's really bad, bad, bad, bad, bad
Messing with my head, head, head, head, head
We drive each other mad, mad, mad, mad, mad
But baby, that's what makes us good in bed
Please, come take it out on me, me, me, me, me
I know it's really bad, bad, bad, bad
But baby, that's what makes us good in bed

[Post-Chorus]
It's bad
We drive each other mad
It might be kinda sad
But I think that's what makes us good in bed

[Verse 2]
I dedicate this verse to 
All that good pipe in the moonlight
In the long nights where we did everything but talk it through
That's what we do, yeah 
You always let me down, boy 
But when you're going down, I get so up 
Don't know if I can find someone who do me like you do

[Pre-Chorus]
I've been thinking it'd be better
If we didn't know each other 
Then you go and make me feel okay
Got me thinking it'd be better
If we didn't stay together
Then you put your hands up on my waist 

[Chorus]
I know it's really bad, bad, bad, bad, bad
Messing with my head, head, head, head, head
We drive each other mad, mad, mad, mad, mad
But baby, that's what makes us good in bed
Please , come take it out on me, me, me, me, me
I know it's really bad, bad, bad, bad
But baby, that's what makes us good in bed

[Post-Chorus]
It's bad
We drive each other mad
It might be kinda sad
But I think that's what makes us good in bed 
It's bad 
We drive each other mad 
It might be kinda sad
But I think that's what makes us good in bed 

[Bridge]

Yeah, we don't know how to talk 
But damn, we know how to fuck

[Chorus]
I know it's really bad, bad, bad, bad, bad 
Messing with my head, head, head, head, head 
We drive each other mad, mad, mad, mad, mad
But baby, that's what makes us good in bed
Please , come take it out on me, me, me, me, me
I know it's really bad, bad, bad, bad
But baby, that's what makes us good in bed 

[Post-Chorus]
It's bad
We drive each other mad
It might be kinda sad
But I think that's what makes us good in bed 
It's bad 
We drive each other mad
It might be kinda sad
But I think that's what makes us good in bed

[Intro]
Future




[Verse 1]
You want a timeless song, I wanna change the game
Like modern architecture,JohnLautner coming yourway
I know you like this beat'cause Jeff's been doin' the damn thing
You wanna turn it up loud, Future Nostalgia is the name 

[Chorus]
I know you're dying trying to figure me out
My name's on the tip of your tongue, keep running your mouth
You want the recipe, but can't handle my sound
My sound, my sound 

[Post-Chorus]
No matter what you do, I'm gonna get it without ya 

I know you ain't used to a female alpha 

No matter what you do, I'm gonna get it without ya 

I know you ain't used to a female alpha 


[Verse 2]
Can't be a rolling stone if you live in a glass house 
You keep on talking that talk, one day, you're gonna blast out
You can't be bitter if I'm out here showing my face 
You want what now looks like, let me give you a taste

[Chorus]
I know you're dying trying to figure me out
My name's on the tip of your tongue, keep running your mouth
You want the recipe, but can't handle my sound
My sound, my sound 

[Post-Chorus]
No matter what you do, I'm gonna get it without ya 

I know you ain't used to a female alpha 

No matter what you do, I'm gonna get it without ya 

I know you ain't used to a female alpha 


[Bridge]
You can't get with this if you ain't built for this
You can't get with this if you ain't built for this
I can't build you up if you ain't tough enough
I can't teach a man how to wear his pants 

[Chorus]
I know you're dying trying to figure me out
My name's on the tip of your tongue, keep running your mouth
You want the recipe, but can't handle my sound
My sound, my sound 
I know you're dying trying to figure me out
My name's on the tip of your tongue, keep running your mouth
You want the recipe, but can't handle my sound
My sound, my sound 

[Outro]


My sound, my sound, my sound
[Verse 1]
Now it's getting quiet here, now it's getting blue
And this, baby, ain't no fair, taking up my youth
You've been telling me some lies, I be thinking it's the truth
But I see it in your eyes, the things that you do

[Refrain]
I don't wanna waste no time all alone
Want somewhere to go, something to call my own
And I ain't satisfied, where to go?
Lost out on the road, washed up on the shore

[Pre-Chorus]
And I've been through mountains and seas
Tryna get you to come back to me
And I've been far, and I've been so deep
Now I find it harder and harder to breathe

[Chorus]
And I need some new love
New love, new love

[Verse 2]
Even though I've run away, I still come back
No, there's nothing more to say, it's all been said
I've been trying to explain the things we had
To all of my friends who say that I've gone mad

[Refrain]
I don't wanna waste no time all alone
Want somewhere to go, something to call my own
And I ain't satisfied, where to go?
Lost out on the road, washed up on the shore

[Pre-Chorus]
And I've been through mountains and seas
Tryna get you to come back to me
And I've been far, and I've been so deep
Now I find it harder and harder to breathe

[Chorus]
And I need some new love
New love, new love
And I need some new love
New love, new love

[Bridge]
Easy come, easy go
Why are we living on, living on?
If we're not getting on, getting on?
Can we just let it go?
Cause we're waiting for a miracle
Why wait for a miracle? Yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
And I've been through mountains and seas
Tryna get you to come back to me
And I've been far, and I've been so deep
Now I find it harder and harder to breathe

[Chorus]
And I need some new love
New love, new love
And I need some new love
New love, new love

[Verse 1]
Fatal, this attraction
Yeah, we might just end up crashin'
But I'm ready if it happens with you
Meet me out in Cali when I'm far away from family
And I need someone to hold onto

[Pre-Chorus]
You're the only thing I know
And I don't wanna let this go
Close to you I feel, feel like I'm at home
Can't wait 'til we're alone

[Chorus]
We were built to last
We were built like that
Baby, take my hand
Dive in this romance
We could burn and crash
We could take a chance
Holdin' nothin' back
Like it's our last dance
Like it's our last dance
Like it's our last dance

[Verse 2]
My heart wide open
Fallin' in and out of focus
Pressure flowin' like a river in my head
Crying you ain't with me and it's floodin' the whole city
While my soul's burnin' like a cigarette

[Pre-Chorus]
You're the only thing I know
And I don't wanna let this go
Close to you I feel, feel like I'm at home
Can't wait 'til we're alone

[Chorus]
We were built to last
We were built like that
Baby, take my hand
Dive in this romance
We could burn and crash
We could take a chance
Holdin' nothin' back
Like it's our last dance
Like it's our last dance
Like it's our last dance
Like it's our last dance
Like it's our last dance

[Bridge]
Way too soon to feel so strong
Way too young to hurt so long
I'm hurtin'
Was it worth it?
Way too soon to feel so strong
Way too young to hurt so long
I'm hurtin'
Was it worth it?

[Breakdown]
Like it's our last dance
Like it's our last dance
Like it's our last dance

[Verse 1]
Maybe one day, I can see you
We can smile and wave, and it'll be okay
Maybe one day, it'll be cool
We could just be friends without the complications that it brings
When we start saying things
Yeah, I hurt you, and you hurt me
Yeah, we did some things that we can never take back
And we tried hard just to fix it
But we broke it more
And so, I guess some things are not meant to last
Is it too much to ask?

[Chorus]
For tonight
Let's love like there's no goodbyes 
Just for tonight
Pretend that it's all alright 
Why don't we hold each other, use each other, whisper pretty lies?
Just for tonight
Let's love like there's no goodbyes 

[Post-Chorus]
No goodbyes
No goodbyes
No goodbyes, eh

[Verse 2]
In a dark room
We don't have to see the light of truth between me and you
We can stay blind in the meantime
Let our bodies say what we can never seem to communicate
Even though it's too late

[Chorus]
For tonight
Let's love like there's no goodbyes 
Just for tonight
Pretend that it's all alright 
Why don't we hold each other, use each other, whisper pretty lies?
Just for tonight
Let's love like there's no goodbyes 

[Post-Chorus]
No goodbyes
No goodbyes
No goodbyes, eh
No goodbyes 
No goodbyes 
No goodbyes, eh

[Bridge]
Maybe one day, I'll see you
Just smile and wave and be okay

[Chorus]
For tonight
Let's love like there's no goodbyes
For tonight
Pretend that it's all alright 
Why don't we hold each other, use each other, whisper pretty lies?
Just for tonight
Let's love like there's no goodbyes 

[Outro]
No goodbyes
No goodbyes
No goodbyes, eh
No goodbyes
No goodbyes
No goodbyes, eh

[Verse 1]
I never thought that I would find a way out
I never thought I'd hear myheartbeat so loud
Ican't believe there's something left inmy chest anymore
But goddamn, you got me in love again
I used to think that I was made out of stone
I used to spend so many nights on my own
I never knew I had it in me to dance anymore
But goddamn, you got me in love again

[Pre-Chorus]
Show me that heaven's right here, baby
Touch me, so I know I'm not crazy
Never have I ever met somebody like you
Used to be afraid of love and what it might do
But goddamn, you got me in love again

[Chorus]
You got me in love again
You got me in love again
You got me in love again
Again

[Verse 2]
So many nights, my tears fell harder than rain
Scared I would take my broken heart to the grave
I'd rather die than have to live in a storm like before
But goddamn, you got me in love again

[Pre-Chorus]
Show me that heaven's right here, baby
Touch me, so I know I'm not crazy
Never have I ever met somebody like you
Used to be afraid of love and what it might do
But goddamn, you got me in love again

[Chorus]
You got me in love again
You got me in love again
You got me in love again
Again

[Refrain]
I can't believe, I can't believe
I finally found someone
I'll sink my teeth in disbelief
'Cause you're the one that I want
I can't believe, I can't believe
I'm not afraid anymore
Goddamn, you got me in love again

[Bridge]
La-la-la, la-la-la
La-la-la, la-la-la
I never thought that I would find a way out
I never thought I'd hear my heart beat so loud
I can't believe there's something left in my chest anymore
Oh, goddamn, you got me in love again



[Refrain]
I can't believe, I can't believe
I finally found someone
I'll sink my teeth in disbelief
'Cause you're the one that I want
I can't believe there's something left inside my chest anymore
But goddamn, you got me in love again

[Chorus]
You got me in love again
You got me in love again
You got me in love again 
Again 

[Verse 1]
I'm young for tonight, it's all under my control
I won't hesitate, it's my turn to make that call
I just want a touch, I ain't here for love no more
Okay, yeah

[Chorus]
I won't stop, nah, no
Guess what?
Eh la, eh la, it's my body
Ride a golden light
Eh la, eh la, it's my body
I'll dance if I want to

[Post-Chorus]
Eh la, eh la, it's my body
Eh la, eh la, it's my body

[Verse 2]
Some people do, but some, they just like to talk, okay
Some shoot the breeze, but some like to leave a mark, okay
Some need the light, and some people like the dark
Okay, yeah

[Chorus]
I won't stop, nah, no
Guess what?
Eh la, eh la, it's my body
Ride a golden light
Eh la, eh la, it's my body
I'll dance if I want to

[Post-Chorus]
Eh la, eh la, it's my body
Eh la, eh la, it's my body

[Bridge]
Gimme release, keep the drugs
Gimme relief, keep the love
Just gimme a piece of that, one piece of that
Give it to me, don't judge
Just give it to me, no heart
No second degree tonight, run free tonight
I'll dance if I want to

[Outro]
My body, my body, my body
Eh la, eh la, it's my body
Eh la, eh la, it's my body
My body, my body, my body
Eh la, eh la, it's my body
Gonna dance if I want to, want to
Gonna dance if I want to, want to
Eh la, eh la, it's my body

[Verse 1]
Somewhere in the middle, I
Think I lied a little, I
I said if we took itthere,I wasn't gonnachange
But that went out the window,yeah 

[Pre-Chorus]
I know that I seem a little stressed out
But you're here now, and you're turning me on
I wanna feel a different kinda tension
Yeah, you guessed it, the kind that's fun
Hate it when you leave me unattended
'Cause I miss ya, and I need your love
When my mind is runnin' wild
Could you help me slow it down?

[Chorus]
Put my mind at ease
Pretty please
I need your hands on me
Sweet relief
Pretty please

[Verse 2]
Exactly where I want me, yeah
Underneath your body, yeah
If we take it further, I swear I ain't gonna break
So, baby, come try me
Baby, come find me
Baby, don't wind me up

[Pre-Chorus]
I know that I seem a little stressed out
But you're here now, and you're turning me on
I wanna feel a different kinda tension
Yeah, you guessed it, the kind that's fun
Hate it when you leave me unattended
'Cause I miss ya, and I need your love
When my mind is runnin' wild
Could you help me slow it down?

[Chorus]
Put my mind at ease
Pretty please
I need your hands on me
Sweet relief
Pretty
Put my mind at ease
Trickle down my spine
Oh, you look so pretty, please
Every single night, I need your hands on me
When your kisses climb
Oh, you give me sweet relief
Made me feel so pretty
Would you help me out, please?

[Break]
Pretty
Pretty
Pretty
Pretty

[Pre-Chorus]
Hate it when you leave me unattended
'Cause I miss ya, and I need your love
When my mind is runnin' wild
Could you help me slow it down?

[Chorus]
Put my mind at ease
Trickle down my spine
Oh, you look so pretty, please
Every single night, I need your hands on me
When your kisses climb
Oh, you give me sweet relief
Made me feel so pretty
Would you help me out, please?

[Outro]
Pretty please

[Verse 1]
I was five, and he was six
We rode on horses made of sticks
He wore black and I wore white
He would always win the fight

[Chorus 1]
Bang bang
He shot me down
Bang bang
I hit the ground
Bang bang
That awful sound
Bang bang
My baby shot me down

[Verse 2]
Seasons came and changed the time
When I grew up, I called him mine
He would always laugh and say
"Remember when we used to play"

[Chorus 2]
Bang bang
I shot you down
Bang bang
You hit the ground
Bang bang
That awful sound
Bang bang
I used to shoot you down

[Bridge]
Music played and people sang
Just for me the church bells rang
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Now he's gone, I don't know why
And 'til this day, I sometimes cry
He didn't even say goodbye
He didn't take the time to lie

[Chorus 1]
Bang bang
He shot me down
Bang bang
I hit the ground
Bang bang
That awful sound
Bang bang
My baby shot me down

[Outro]
Oh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
My baby shot me down

[Verse 1]
Remember when we swam in the ocean?
Now we know what's deep inside
Remember when we ran in the open?
Now we know what's in the wild
Used to think that this love was Heaven sent
How did we get lost? Can't get back again
Tell me, is there light on the outside?

[Chorus 1]
So are we leaving this Garden of Eden?
Are we leaving this Garden of Eden?

[Verse 2]
Used to walk around your apartment
Nothing but a smile on me
But tonight I'm so self conscious
Isn't it so clear to see?
Nothing's ever perfect in Paradise
Don't know what it's worth 'til you pay the price
When you bite your tongue does it draw blood?

[Chorus 2]
So are we leaving this Garden of Eden?
Are we leaving this Garden of Eden?
Now I know what I know
But its hard to find the meaning
Where do we go?
'Cause we don't believe in this Garden of Eden

This Garden of Eden?


[Verse 3]
I have cried for you, and I'll ride for you
I would die for you, but would you do that for me?
Tell the truth, what you wanna do
Is it me and you?
Are you with me, honey?
I have cried for you, and I'll ride for you
I would die for you, but would you do that for me?
Tell the truth, what you wanna do
Is it me and you?
Are you with me?

[Chorus 2]
So are we leaving this Garden of Eden?
Are we leaving this Garden of Eden?
Now I know what I know
But it's hard to find the meaning
Where do we go?
'Cause we don't believe in this Garden of Eden

This garden of Eden


[Bridge]
Remember when we swam in the ocean?
Now we know what's deep inside
Remember when we ran in the open?

[Chorus 3]
So are we leaving?

Are we leaving?

Now I know what I know
But it's hard to find the meaning
Where do we go?
'Cause we don't believe in this Garden of Eden

This garden of Eden
[Verse 1]
Know you're bad for me, but you know I am too
Me and you together, like a loved up bruise
I'll make you an offer that you can't refuse
Baby, you're okay
Baby, you're okay
No, you won't, won't go breaking my heart
You've seen that we got the same pain, same scar
Felt that when we got closer in the dark
Baby, I'm okay
Baby, I'm okay

[Pre-Chorus]
Baby, when
When you're far away, I promise you I'll be good
I guess we're misunderstood
So baby, please, don't hear what people say
'Cause I've heard things 'bout you too
Makes me know that I'm for you

[Chorus]
Oh, no, I don't care what's been done here before me
I don't give a damn, just as long as you care
'Cause, baby, I've been bad, but the heavens forgave me
You don't need to ask 'cause I'm already there
Let's be bad together, baby, you and I
Let's be bad together, if only for a while
Let's be bad together, make the devil smile
Let's be bad together, let's be bad together, ooh yeah

[Verse 2]
Nothing could stop us, we got it all
The love, the passion, but most of all
We mess up, but run from the scene
But I throw my hands up, if you know what I mean
Ah, 'cause I'm not afraid to tell you when you're wrong
And I know that you miss me when I'm gone
We make a great team
With you, I'm badder than I've ever been

[Pre-Chorus]
Baby, when
When you're far away, I promise you I'll be good
I guess we're misunderstood
So baby, please, don't hear what people say
'Cause I've heard things 'bout you too
Makes me know that I'm for you

[Chorus]
Oh, no, I don't care what's been done here before me
I don't give a damn, just as long as you care
'Cause, baby, I've been bad, but the heavens forgave me
You don't need to ask 'cause I'm already there
Let's be bad together, baby, you and I
Let's be bad together, if only for a while
Let's be bad together, make the devil smile
Let's be bad together, let's be bad together, ooh yeah

[Bridge]
Let's be bad, babe
Let's be bad
Let's be bad, babe
Let's be bad
Let's be bad, babe
Let's be bad
Let's be bad, babe

[Chorus]
Oh, no, I don't care what's been done here before me
I don't give a damn, just as long as you care
'Cause, baby, I've been bad, but the heavens forgave me
You don't need to ask 'cause I'm already there
Let's be bad together, baby, you and I
Let's be bad together, if only for a while
Let's be bad together, make the devil smile
Let's be bad together, let's be bad together, ooh yeah

[Verse 1]
Guess I never had a love like this 
Hit me harder than I ever expected
Webeen up allgoddamn night, all night, all night
Keep it going till we see the sunlight

[Pre-Chorus]
And the colour of the sky looking nice-o-nice
You know, you know, you know
Baby, I could see us in the real life
You know, you know you got

[Chorus]
Got me losin' all my cool
'Cause I'm burnin' up on you
In control of what I do
And I love the way you move
We'll get the heat and the thrill
Gives you more than any pill
Never runnin' out of juice
When it's only me and you
You got me, you got me losin' all my cool
I guess we're ready for the summer

[Verse 2]
I like us better when we're intertwined 
The way you touch me got me losin' my senses 
Put your love with your lips on mine, on mine, on mine 
You got me working up an appetite-tite

[Pre-Chorus]
And the colour of the sky looking nice-o-nice
You know, you know, you know
Baby, I could see us in the real life
You know, you know you got

[Chorus]
Got me losin' all my cool
'Cause I'm burnin' up on you
In control of what I do
And I love the way you move
We'll get the heat and the thrill
Gives you more than any pill
Never runnin' out of juice
When it's only me and you
You got me, you got me losin' all my cool
I guess we're ready for the summer
You got me, you got me losin' all my cool
I guess we're ready for the summer 

[Bridge]
Skintight
I'll show you heaven, there's nothing better
I'll give it to you all night
You know, you know, you know
Got me losin' all my cool
Yeah, you like the way I move
In control of what I do
And my love makes you brand new

[Chorus]
Got me losin' all my cool 
'Cause I'm burnin' up on you 
In control of what I do
And I love the way you move 
We'll get the heat and the thrill
Gives you more than any pill
Never runnin' out of juice 
When it's only me and you
When it's only me and you 
I guess we're ready for the summer 
You got me, you got me losin' all my cool 
I guess we're ready for the summer 
You got me, you got me losin' all my cool

[Verse 1]
Pocketful of honey and I'm ready to go
No, I ain't got no money, but I'mlettingyou know
That I'malove you like a fool
Breathe youin till I hallucinate 
Body make you silly, make you do what I want
Oh baby, I can make it pretty, I could string you along
But I'ma love you like a fool
Breathe you in till I hallucinate 

[Pre-Chorus]
No, I couldn't live without your touch
No, I could never have too much
I'll breathe you in forever and ever
Hallucinate

[Chorus]
I hallucinate when you call my name
Got stars in my eyes
And they don't fade when you come my way
I'm losing my mi-mi-mi-mind, mi-mi-mi-mind
Mi-mi-mi-mind, mi-mi-mi-mind
I hallucinate when you call my name
Got stars in my

[Verse 2]
Put you in my hall of fame, middle of the wall
Yeah, you're my one, my favorite, my ride or die, oh
Yeah, I'ma love you like a fool
Breathe you in till I hallucinate 

[Pre-Chorus]
No, I couldn't live without your touch
No, I could never have too much
I'll breathe you in forever and ever
Hallucinate

[Chorus]
I hallucinate when you call my name
Got stars in my eyes
And they don't fade when you come my way
I'm losing my mi-mi-mi-mind, mi-mi-mi-mind
Mi-mi-mi-mind, mi-mi-mi-mind
I hallucinate when you call my name
Got stars in my

[Bridge]
Wanna be right where you are
Let's go dancing in the dark
Don't wait, you can push to start, lose control
Kill me slowly with your kiss
Wrap me 'round your fingertips
Damn, I need another hit


[Chorus]
I hallucinate when you call my name
Got stars in my eyes
And they don't fade when you come my way
I'm losing my mi-mi-mi-mind, mi-mi-mi-mind
Mi-mi-mi-mind, mi-mi-mi-mind
I hallucinate when you call my name
Got stars in my

[Verse 1]
All of these highs
And all of these lows
Don't keep me company
I've been breathing you in
And drinking you down
You're the only remedy

[Pre-Chorus]
Say you're gonna hold my head up
Say you're gonna break my fall
Say you're gonna stay forever
Baby, this is all I want

[Chorus]
'Cause all my bones
Are begging me to beg for you
Begging me to beg for your love
Oh, my lungs
Are begging me to beg for you
Begging me to beg for your love
Swear I'm gonna hold your head up
Swear I'm gonna break your fall
Swear we're gonna last forever
Baby, this is all I want
'Cause all my bones
Are begging me to beg for you
Begging me to beg for your love

[Verse 2]
Losing my mind
Dreaming I'll find
Another kind of love
But this blood in my veins
And the thought of your taste
No, I can't give it up
So look at my face
I'm not running away

[Chorus]
'Cause all my bones
Are begging me to beg for you
Begging me to beg for your love
Swear I'm gonna hold your head up
Swear I'm gonna break your fall
Swear we're gonna last forever
Baby, this is all I want
'Cause all my bones
Are begging me to beg for you
Begging me to beg for your love

[Instrumental Break]

[Breakdown]
Say you're gonna hold my head up
Say you're gonna break my fall
Say you're gonna stay forever
Baby, this is all I want

[Chorus]
Swear I'm gonna hold your head up
Swear I'm gonna break your fall
Swear we're gonna last forever
Baby, this is all I want
'Cause all my bones
Are begging me to beg for you
Begging me to beg for your love
Oh, my lungs
Are begging me to beg for you
Begging me to beg for your love

[Chorus]
Up and down, it all comes back around
Push and shove, do you feel better now?
Knock, knock, knock, you'll come tumblin' down
Karma's got a kiss for you

[Verse 1]
Why are you blamin' me for all your insecurities?
I never did anything, but you closed the door
Slammed shut on me
Somethin' a little bit bitter that should've been sweet
I won't compete
You're like a king with a crown lookin' down
Hopin' I won't eat

[Chorus]
Up and down, it all comes back around
Push and shove, do you feel better now?
Knock, knock, knock, you'll come tumblin' down
Karma's got a kiss for you
Up and down, it all comes back around
Push and shove, do you feel better now?
Knock, knock, knock, you'll come tumblin' down
Karma's got a kiss for you

[Verse 2]
Remember what it felt like to start the climb
I'm just like you
Maybe you'll better with time and we'll leave it behind
There's room for two
You should've never done somethin' like that to someone
You can't undo
Thought you were under the radar
But under the chaos, I see through

[Chorus]
Up and down, it all comes back around
Push and shove, do you feel better now?
Knock, knock, knock, you'll come tumblin' down
Karma's got a kiss for you
Up and down, it all comes back around
Push and shove, do you feel better now?
Knock, knock, knock, you'll come tumblin' down
Karma's got a kiss for you

[Bridge]
I'm hopin' one day you will change
See, everyone ain't the same
We're more than machines
You saw a spark where there wasn't a flame
And you barely remember my name
Do you feel complete?

[Chorus]
Up and down, it all comes back around
Push and shove, do you feel better now?
Knock, knock, knock, you'll come tumblin' down
Karma's got a kiss for you
Up and down, it all comes back around
Push and shove, do you feel better now?
Knock, knock, knock, you'll come tumblin' down
Karma's got a kiss for you

[Verse 1]
Last night, my fantasies become oh-so-true
You said you wanted me as much as I want you
If I said it hadn't crossed my mind
Then, oh baby, I'd be lying
It just got complicated, I don't know what to do

[Pre-Chorus]
Can I get it like that, that, that? Let me know
'Cause I really like that, that, that, when you go
And I know it's not real, but the way that I feel
I just need to know
Can I get it like that, that, that? Let me know
'Cause I really like that, that, that, when you go
And I know it's not real, but the way that I feel
I just need to know, know, know, know

[Chorus]
In my dreams
You say you want me, my body
In my dreams
You say you need me, believe me
In my dreams
You say you love me, say you'll never leave my dreams
In my dreams

[Post-Chorus]
You love me like yeah
You love me right, oh yeah
You love me like yeah
You love me right, oh yeah
You love me like yeah
You love me right, oh yeah
You love me like, you love me right
In my dreams

[Verse 2]
Inside I'm screaming loud, I'm calling out your name
It's time you started listening, don't think you can hear me
'Cause if you really wanna go right 'round
Time is tickin', we gotta leave now
Time is tickin', we gotta leave town tonight
Hey

[Pre-Chorus]
Can I get it like that, that, that? Let me know
'Cause I really like that, that, that, when you go
And I know it's not real, but the way that I feel
I just need to know, know, know, know

[Chorus]
In my dreams
You say you want me, my body
In my dreams
You say you need me, believe me
In my dreams
You say you love me, say you'll never leave my dreams
In my dreams

[Post-Chorus]
You love me like yeah
You love me right, oh yeah
You love me like yeah
You love me right, oh yeah
You love me like yeah
You love me right, oh yeah
You love me like, you love me right
In my dreams

[Bridge]
In my dreams, dreams, dreams, yeah
In my dreams, dreams, dreams, yeah
In my dreams, oh

[Chorus]
In my dreams
You say you want me, my body
In my dreams
You say you need me, believe me
In my dreams
You say you love me, say you'll never leave my dreams
In my dreams

[Post-Chorus]
You love me like yeah
You love me right, oh yeah
You love me like yeah
You love me right, oh yeah
You love me like yeah
You love me right, oh yeah
You love me like, you love me right
In my dreams

[Outro]
Yeah
In my dreams
Yeah
In my dreams

[Verse 1]
You and me, we made a vow
For better or for worse
I can't believe you let me down
But the truth's in the way it hurts
For months on end I've had my doubts
Denying every tear
I wish this would be over now
But I know that I still need you here

[Chorus]
You say I'm crazy
'Cause you don't think I know what you've done
But when you call me baby
I know I'm not the only one

[Verse 2]
You've been so unavailable
And sadly, I know why
Your heart is unattainable
Even though Lord knows you kept mine

[Chorus]
You say I'm crazy
'Cause you don't think I know what you've done
But when you call me baby
I know I'm not the only one

[Bridge]
I have loved you for many years
Maybe I am just not enough
You've made me realise my deepest fear
By lying and tearing us up

[Chorus]
You say I'm crazy
'Cause you don't think I know what you've done
But when you call me baby
I know I'm not the only one

[Outro]
And I know, and I know, and I know, and I know, and I know
I know I'm not the only one
I know I'm not the only one
I know I'm not the only one

[Verse 1]
Something told me it was over
When I saw you and her talking
Something deep down in my soul said, "cry girl"
When I saw you and that girl walking out

[Chorus 1]
Ooh
I would rather, I would rather go blind, boy
Than to see you walk away from me child and all

[Verse 2]
I was just, I was just
I was just sitting here thinking
Of your kiss and your warm embrace
When the reflection in the glass that I held to my lips, now baby
Revealed these tears that are on my face, yeah

[Chorus 2]
And baby, and baby, I'd rather be blind, boy
Than to see you walk away, walk away from me, yeah
And baby, and baby, I'd rather be blind now
Than to see you walk away from me

[Outro]
Something told me it was over
When I saw you and her talking

[Verse 1: Dua Lipa]
You call me all friendly
Tellin' me how much you miss me
That's funny, I guess you've heard my songs
Well, I'm too busy for your business
Go find a girl who wants to listen
'Cause if you think I was born yesterday, you have got me wrong

[Pre-Chorus: Dua Lipa]
So I cut you off
I don't need your love
'Cause I already cried enough
I've been done
I've been movin' on since we said goodbye
I cut you off
I don't need your love
So you can try all you want
Your time is up, I'll tell you why

[Chorus: Dua Lipa]
You say you're sorry, but it's too late now
So save it, get gone, shut up
'Cause if you think I care about you now
Well, boy, I don't give a fuck 
Well, boy, I don't give a...

[Verse 2: Rich Brian]
Yeah
Talk every day, like we best friends
Every time we out on a date, we're engaged
I can smell the love in the air, it's a fragrance
If the restaurant ain't open, we gon' make it
Acting nonchalant, but I see through it so clear
Told her "What the hell you gon' do when I'm not here?"
Yeah, we having fun, but baby, we ain't 14
Know that this will probably fuck me up when I walked in
Talkin' bout a story like we don't got problems
But I know it too well, could you just be honest?
Wishing this a fairytale, I told her
Was here having good times but it ain't the right time
And now I don't want to lose this shit we got goin' on
I say we keep on it and what's next
I don't give a fuck

[Chorus: Dua Lipa]
You say you're sorry, but it's too late now
So save it, get gone, shut up
'Cause if you think I care about you now
Well, boy, I don't give a fuck 
Well, boy, I don't give a...

[Post-Chorus]
I see you tryna' get to me
I see you beggin' on your knees
Boy, I don't give a fuck
So stop tryna' get to me
Tch, get up off your knees
'Cause, boy, I don't give a fuck

[Verse 1]
What would you do?
What would you do if I handed you a drug that'd teach you something new?
What would you feel?
What would you feel if I took over the fake and made them all real?
What would you say?
What would you say if I told you it's actually gon' be a good day?

[Chorus]
Maybe all things happen for a reason
You just need to get over this dry season
But the only drug you need is believing
Maybe God does answer all your prayers
Maybe need to let go of the fear
Of being let down from the people you keep near
Maybe it's because you're running low on gear
Maybe God does answer all your prayers

[Verse 2]
What do you need?
What do you need to show you there's better things to life than good weed?
What do you hear?
What do you hear?
What do you hear when I tell you I'm always near?
I made it pretty clear
What do you see?
What do you see when you find out the best things in life are all free?
You got a friend in me

[Chorus]
Maybe all things happen for a reason
You just need to get over this dry season
But the only drug you need is believing
Maybe God does answer all your prayers
Maybe need to let go of the fear
Of being let down from the people you keep near
Maybe it's because you're running low on gear
Maybe God does answer all your prayers

[Bridge]
And I'm still here
And I'm holding hard onto your hand
But it still feels
Like you're never gonna understand
One can drown alone, but we can swim together

[Chorus]
Maybe all things happen for a reason
You just need to get over this dry season
But the only drug you need is believing
Maybe God does answer all your prayers
And let go of the fear
Of being let down from the people you keep near
Is it because you're running low on gear?
Maybe God does answer all your prayers

[Verse 1]
You, you turn gold to dust now
What was trust is lost now
What is all this darkness you have inside?
I just can't ignore it
From my heart, what's pouring
'Cause this hurt I can no longer hide

[Pre-Chorus]
Baby, it's the last time
It's the last time I'm 'bout it, 'bout it
Check it with a flashlight
It's the last night you'll get up on it
If you wanna save it, ooh
Better shoot straight like a laser, ooh
I ain't waiting for you, you

[Chorus]
Now I'm running for my life
Been too many miles
Tryna find the road to you
'Cause you, you just wanna drive
With no place in mind
Where the hell we going to, oh?
I'm running, running
Got me running, running, ooh
I'm running, running
Got me running, running, ooh

[Verse 2]
Boom, barrel, love, a gun, pow
I'll be on the run now
Can't take no more bullets through my wounds
I just can't ignore it
From my heart, what's pouring
'Cause this hurt I can no longer hide

[Pre-Chorus]
Baby, it's the last time
It's the last time I'm 'bout it, 'bout it
Check it with a flashlight
It's the last night you'll get up on it
If you wanna save it, ooh
Better shoot straight like a laser, ooh
I ain't waiting for you, you

[Chorus]
Now I'm running for my life
Been too many miles
Tryna find the road to you
'Cause you, you just wanna drive
With no place in mind
Where the hell we going to, oh?
I'm running, running
Got me running, running, ooh
I'm running, running
Got me running, running, ooh
I'm running, running
Got me running, running, ooh
I'm running, running
Got me running, running, ooh

[Bridge]
So watch it blow when I let it go
When I cut this rope and run, run
By the time you wake, it'll be too late
Now the bullet's left the gun, yeah

[Chorus]
Now I'm running for my life
Been too many miles
Tryna find the road to you
'Cause you, you just wanna drive
With no place in mind
Where the hell we going to, oh?
I'm running, running
Got me running, running, ooh
I'm running, running
Got me running, running, ooh
I'm running, running
Got me running, running, ooh
I'm running, running
Got me running, running, ooh

[Intro: The Persuasions]
All we need is a little bit of honey, huh
Oh, yes, we do
I know there's gonna be...

[Verse 1: Dua Lipa]
Work every day 'til me meet ends
I will turn it up on weekends
Make a toast, be a real friend
Tell me what you're drinking, cuh

[Hook: The Persuasions]
I know there's gonna be good times 
There's gonna be good times 
There's gonna be good times, oh

[Verse 2: Dua Lipa]
Good times, there gon' be some good times
'Member used to pull up, and let 'em fight?
That's that hood time
'Member used to hold on your hand when nobody would time?
Yeah, I know that bitch trippin', she ain't got that much time
I don't waste time, I don't waste time
I don't have patience, baby
She tryna copy my shit, but she be missin' the hits
Wanna go fast? Wanna race me?
We gon' ball, Walter Payton
We gon' fly through the stations
Come here bae, you're a blessin'
And from you, I learn my lesson
Pop quiz, it's a pop quiz
All my money comin' clean, you can't pop this
But she can't get it locked up like locksmith
Watch her come to my lights, like a reindeer
Me and papi on the same pills
My diamonds, never stand still
Where you goin'? Why you ain't here?
You sold your soul for the mass appeal

[Hook: The Persuasions]
I know there's gonna be good times 
There's gonna be good times 
There's gonna be good times 
There's gonna be good
I know there's gonna be good times 
There's gonna be good times 
There's gonna be good times, oh

[Verse 3: Dua Lipa]
We be ridin' like a mothafuckin' stroller
I'll survive in a mothafuckin' gutter
That's my mothafuckin' woadie, like the Noila
And I'm colored red like Coke-Cola
I'ma have a very good time
I swear to God, I can't never sideline shorty
She, she said she likes all of my man's rhymes
Where is my phone? That money be callin'
I want you to pass it to Thugger Thugger
Even in the summertime, me and shawty hustle
I swear to God, I'ma tip you, got to struggle
Baby girl, sit it down, you not known like an usher
I told lil' baby, "I don't bite but my teeth do."
I wanna control you like voodoo
I'm steady screaming free, Unfunk and DuLu
Every time I have a good time you do too

[Hook: The Persuasions]
I know there's gonna be good times 
There's gonna be good times 
There's gonna be good times 
There's gonna be good
I know there's gonna be good times 
There's gonna be good times 
There's gonna be good times, oh

[Outro: The Persuasions]
Real bad, baby
I can't afford the fancy, fancy places, oh
But long as you have faith in me
We'll have ourselves

[Verse 1]
Gimme release
Keep the drugs
Gimme relief
Keep the love, just gimme a piece of that
One piece of that
Give it to me
Dont judge, just give it to me
No heart, no second degree tonight
Run free tonight

[Chorus]
I wont stop
Not now
Guess what?
Hella, hella, its my body right
I go in light
Hella, hella, its my body
Ill dance if I want to

[Drop]
Hella, hella, its my body
Hella, hella, its my body

[Verse 2]
Some people do
But some, they just like to talk 
Some shoot the breeze
But some like to leave a mark 
Some need the light
And some people like the dark 

[Chorus]
I wont stop
Not now
Guess what?
Hella, hella, its my body right
I go in light
Hella, hella, its my body
Ill dance if I want to

[Drop]
Hella, hella, its my body
Hella, hella, its my body

[Bridge]
Don't cry for us
No time for us
When we're at some party
When you grab somebody
Don't cry for us
No time for us
When we're at some party
When you grab somebody

[Outro]
Ill dance if I want to
My body, my body, my body
Hella, hella, its my body
Gonna dance if I want to, want to
Hella, hella, it's my body
My body, my body, my body
Hella, hella, it's my body
Gonna dance if I want to, want to
Hella, hella, it's my body

[Intro]
Cigarettes on cigarettes, cigarettes on cigarettes
Cigarettes on cigarettes, cigarettes on cigarettes

[Chorus]
Cigarettes on cigarettes, my mama think I stank
I got burn holes in my hoodies, all my homies think it's dank
I miss my cocoa butter kisses
I miss my cocoa butter kisses

[Verse]
Okie dokie, alchy, keep it low-key like Thor, lil bro
Or he'll go blow the loudy, saudy of sour Saudi
Wiley up off peyote, wilding like that coyote
If I sip any Henny, my belly just might be outie
Pull up inside a huggy, Starsky & Hutch a dougie
I just opened up the pack, in an hour, I'll ash my lucky
She just yelling "Fuck me"
Two weeks, she'll be yelling, "Fuck me"
Tonight, she yelling, "Fuck me"
Two weeks, she'll be yelling, "Fuck me"
Used to like orange cassette tapes with Timmy, Tommy, and Chuckie
And Chuck E. Cheese's pizzas, Jesus pieces, sing Jesus love me
Visine inside my eyes so my grandma would fucking hug me
Oh, generation above me, yeah, I know you still remember me

[Refrain]
Cigarettes on cigarettes, cigarettes on cigarettes
Cigarettes on cigarettes, cigarettes on cigarettes

[Verse 2]
I will smoke a little something but I don't inhale
Everywhere that I go, everywhere they be asking how's it going
Say the going gets well, go figure, Victor's light skinned
Jesus got me feeling like Colin Powell, all praise to the God
God knows he's a pro, he's a pro like COINTEL
Check, checkmate, check me, take me to the bedroom
Let me know me well, I mean normally
You see Norma Jean wouldn't kick it with Farmer Phil
But these kids these days, they get so high
Burn trees, smoke chlorophyll, 'til they can't feel
Got me feeling like Lauryn Hill, miseducated, my dick delegated
Rap Bill Bellamy, they shoulda never made it
Probably been dead or in jail
Deadbeat dad, enough of that jazz
Asshole, absinthe up in that glass
Are we there yet? Ice cubes in a bong
We're brain dead, take a tug and then pass, then pass

[Bridge]
I think we all addicted
I think we all addicted, yeah
I think we all addicted
I think we all addicted

[Refrain]
Cigarettes on cigarettes, cigarettes on cigarettes
Cigarettes on cigarettes, cigarettes on cigarettes

[Chorus]
Cigarettes on cigarettes, my mama think I stank
I got burn holes in my hoodies, all my homies think it's dank
I miss my cocoa butter kisses
I miss my cocoa butter kisses
Cigarettes on cigarettes, my mama think I stank
I got burn holes in my hoodies, all my homies think it's dank
Cocoa butter kisses, I miss my cocoa butter kisses, yeah

[Verse 1]
I wanna follow where she goes
I think about her and she knows it
I wanna let her take control
'Cause everytime that she gets close, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
She pulls me in enough to keep me guessing 
And maybe I should stop and start confessing, confessing, yeah

[Chorus]
Oh, I've been shaking
I love it when you go crazy
You take all my inhibitions
Baby, there's nothing holdin' me back
You take me places that tear up my reputation
Manipulate my decisions
Baby, there's nothing holdin' me back
There's nothing holdin' me back
There's nothing holdin' me back

[Verse 2]
She says that she's never afraid
Just picture everybody naked
She really doesn't like to wait
Not really into hesitation

[Pre-Chorus]
Pulls me in enough to keep me guessing
And maybe I should stop and start confessing, confessing, yeah

[Chorus]
Oh, I've been shaking
I love it when you go crazy
You take all my inhibitions
Baby, there's nothing holdin' me back
You take me places that tear up my reputation
Manipulate my decisions
Baby, there's nothing holdin' me back
There's nothing holdin' me back

[Bridge]
'Cause if we lost our minds and we took it way too far
I know we'd be alright, I know we would be alright
If you were by my side and we stumbled in the dark
I know we'd be alright, I know we would be alright
'Cause if we lost our minds and we took it way too far
I know we'd be alright, I know we would be alright
If you were by my side and we stumbled in the dark
I know we'd be alright, we would be alright

[Chorus]
Oh, I've been shaking
I love it when you go crazy
You take all my inhibitions
Baby, there's nothing holdin' me back
You take me places that tear up my reputation
Manipulate my decisions
Baby, there's nothing holdin' me back 
There's nothing holdin' me back
I feel so free when you're with me, baby
Baby, there's nothing holdin' me back

[Intro]
Help me, it's like the walls are caving in
Sometimes I feel like giving up
But I just can't
It isn't in my blood

[Verse 1]
Laying on the bathroom floor, feeling nothing
I'm overwhelmed and insecure, give me something
I could take to ease my mind slowly
Just have a drink and you'll feel better
Just take her home and you'll feel better
Keep telling me that it gets better
Does it ever?

[Pre-Chorus]
Help me, it's like the walls are caving in
Sometimes I feel like giving up
No medicine is strong enough
Someone help me
I'm crawling in my skin
Sometimes I feel like giving up
But I just can't

[Chorus]
It isn't in my blood
It isn't in my blood

[Verse 2]
I'm looking through my phone again feeling anxious
Afraid to be alone again, I hate this
I'm trying to find a way to chill, can't breathe, oh
Is there somebody who could...

[Pre-Chorus]
Help me, it's like the walls are caving in
Sometimes I feel like giving up
No medicine is strong enough
Someone help me
I'm crawling in my skin
Sometimes I feel like giving up
But I just can't

[Chorus]
It isn't in my blood
It isn't in my blood

[Bridge]
I need somebody now
I need somebody now
Someone to help me out
I need somebody now

[Pre-Chorus]
Help me, it's like the walls are caving in
Sometimes I feel like giving up
But I just can't

[Chorus]
It isn't in my blood
It isn't in my blood, oh

[Outro]
It isn't in my blood
I need somebody now
It isn't in my blood
I need somebody now
It isn't in my blood

[Verse 1]
All it'd take is one flight
We'd be in the same time zone
Looking through your timeline
Seeing all the rainbows, I
I got an idea
And I know that it sounds crazy
I just wanna see ya
Oh, I gotta ask

[Chorus]
Do you got plans tonight?
I'm a couple hundred miles from Japan, and I
I was thinking I could fly to your hotel tonight
'Cause I-I-I can't get you off my mind
Can't get you off my mind
Can't get you off my mind 

[Verse 2]
I could feel the tension
We could cut it with a knife
I know it's more than just a friendship
I can hear you think I'm right, yeah
Do I gotta convince you
That you shouldn't fall asleep?
It'll only be a couple hours
And I'm about to leave

[Chorus]
Do you got plans tonight?
I'm a couple hundred miles from Japan, and I
I was thinking I could fly to your hotel tonight
'Cause I-I-I can't get you off my mind
Can't get you off my mind
Can't get you off my mind
Do you got plans tonight?
I was hoping I could get lost in your paradise
The only thing I'm thinking 'bout is you and I
'Cause I-I-I can't get you off my mind
Can't get you off my mind
I can't seem to get you off my mind

[Bridge]
Let's get lost tonight 
Let's get lost tonight
Baby, you and
I can't seem to get you off my mind
Let's get lost tonight
Let's get lost tonight
Baby, you and
I can't seem to get you off my mind
Oh-oh-oh-oh

[Chorus]
Do you got plans tonight?
I'm a couple hundred miles from Japan, and I
I was thinking I could fly to your hotel tonight
'Cause I-I-I can't get you off my mind
I can't get you off my mind
Do you got plans tonight, baby?
I was hoping I could get lost in your paradise
The only thing I'm thinking 'bout is you and I
And I-I-I can't get you off my mind
Can't get you off my mind
I can't seem to get you off my mind, yeah

[Outro]
Let's get lost tonight 
Let's get lost tonight 
Baby, you and
I can't seem to get you off my mind
Let's get lost tonight 
Let's get lost tonight 
Baby, you and
I can't seem to get you off my mind

[Verse 1]
I won't lie to you
I know he's just not right for you
And you can tell me if I'm off
But I see it on your face
When you say that he's the one that you want
And you're spending all your time
In this wrong situation
And anytime you want it to stop

[Chorus]
I know I can treat you better than he can
And any girl like you deserves a gentleman
Tell me why are we wasting time
On all your wasted crying
When you should be with me instead
I know I can treat you better
Better than he can

[Verse 2]
I'll stop time for you
The second you say you'd like me too
I just wanna give you the loving that you're missing
Baby, just to wake up with you
Would be everything I need and this could be so different
Tell me what you want to do

[Chorus]
'Cause I know I can treat you better than he can
And any girl like you deserves a gentleman
Tell me why are we wasting time
On all your wasted crying
When you should be with me instead
I know I can treat you better
Better than he can
Better than he can

[Bridge]
Give me a sign
Take my hand, we'll be fine
Promise I won't let you down
Just know that you don't
Have to do this alone
Promise I'll never let you down

[Chorus]
'Cause I know I can treat you better than he can
And any girl like you deserves a gentleman
Tell me why are we wasting time
On all your wasted crying
When you should be with me instead
I know I can treat you better
Better than he can
Better than he can
Better than he can

[Chorus]
I can't write one song that's not about you
Can't drink without thinkin' about you
Is it too late to tell you that
Everything means nothing if I can't have you?

[Verse 1]
I'm in Toronto and I got this view
But I might as well be in a hotel room, yeah
It doesn't matter 'cause I'm so consumed
Spending all my nights reading texts from you

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, I'm good at keeping my distance
I know that you're the feeling I'm missing
You know that I hate to admit it
But everything means nothing if I can't have you

[Chorus]
I can't write one song that's not about you
Can't drink without thinkin' about you
Is it too late to tell you that
Everything means nothing if I can't have you?
I can't write one song that's not about you
Can't drink without thinkin' about you
Is it too late to tell you that
Everything means nothing if I can't have you?

[Verse 2]
I'm so sorry that my timing's off
But I can't move on if we're still gonna talk
Is it wrong for me to not want half?
I want all of you, all the strings attached

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, I'm good at keeping my distance
I know that you're the feeling I'm missing
You know that I hate to admit it
But everything means nothing if I can't have you

[Chorus]
I can't write one song that's not about you
Can't drink without thinkin' about you
Is it too late to tell you that
Everything means nothing if I can't have you?
I can't write one song that's not about you
Can't drink without thinking about you
Is it too late to tell you that
Everything means nothing if I can't have you?

[Bridge]
I'm trying to move on, forget you, but I hold on
Everything means nothing, everything means nothing, babe
I'm trying to move on, forget you, but I hold on
Everything means nothing if I can't have you, no

[Chorus]
I can't write one song that's not about you
Can't drink without thinkin' about you
Is it too late to tell you that
Everything means nothing if I can't have you? 
I can't write one song that's not about you
Can't drink without thinking about you
Is it too late to tell you that
Everything means nothing if I can't have you?

[Verse 1]
You've got a hold on me
Don't even know your power
I stand a hundred feet
But I fall when I'm around ya
Show me an open door
And you go and slam it on me
I can't take anymore

[Chorus]
I'm saying
Baby, please have mercy on me
Take it easy on my heart
Even though you don't mean to hurt me
You keep tearing me apart
Would you please have mercy, mercy on my heart?
Would you please have mercy, mercy on my heart?

[Verse 2]
I'd drive through the night
Just to be near you, baby
Heart open, testify
Tell me that I'm not crazy
I'm not asking for a lot
Just that you're honest with me
And my pride, is all I got

[Chorus]
I'm saying
Baby, please have mercy on me
Take it easy on my heart
Even though you don't mean to hurt me
You keep tearing me apart
Would you please have mercy on me?
I'm a puppet on your strings
And even though you got good intentions
I need you to set me free
Would you please have mercy, mercy on my heart?
Would you please have mercy, mercy on my heart?

[Bridge]
Consuming all the air inside my lungs
Ripping all the skin from off my bones
I'm prepared to sacrifice my life
I would gladly do it twice
Consuming all the air inside my lungs
Ripping all the skin from off my bones
I'm prepared to sacrifice my life
I would gladly do it twice

[Chorus]
Oh, please have mercy on me
Take it easy on my heart
Even though you don't mean to hurt me
You keep tearing me apart
Would you please have mercy on me?
I'm a puppet on your string
And even though you got good intentions
I need you to set me free
I'm begging you for mercy, mercy
I'm begging you, begging you, please, baby
I'm begging you for mercy, mercy
Ooh, I'm begging you, I'm begging you[Music Video]

[Verse 1]
I thought that I've been hurt before
But no one's ever left me quite this sore
Your words cut deeper than a knife
Now I need someone to breathe me back to life

[Pre-Chorus]
Got a feeling that I'm going under
But I know that I'll make it out alive
If I quit calling you my lover
Move on

[Chorus]
You watch me bleed until I can't breathe, shaking
Falling onto my knees
And now that I'm without your kisses
I'll be needing stitches
Tripping over myself, aching
Begging you to come help
And now that I'm without your kisses
I'll be needing stitches

[Verse 2]
Just like a moth drawn to a flame
Oh, you lured me in I couldn't sense the pain
Your bitter heart, cold to the touch
Now I'm gonna reap what I sow
I'm left seeing red on my own

[Pre-Chorus]
Got a feeling that I'm going under
But I know that I'll make it out alive
If I quit calling you my lover
Move on

[Chorus]
You watch me bleed until I can't breathe, shaking
Falling onto my knees
And now that I'm without your kisses
I'll be needing stitches
Tripping over myself, aching
Begging you to come help
And now that I'm without your kisses
I'll be needing stitches

[Bridge]
Needle and the thread, gotta get you out of my head
Needle and the thread, gonna wind up dead
Needle and the thread, gotta get you out of my head
Needle and the thread, gonna wind up dead
Needle and the thread, gotta get you out of my head
Needle and the thread, gonna wind up dead
Needle and the thread, gotta get you out of my head
Get you out of my head

[Chorus]
You watch me bleed until I can't breathe, shaking
Falling onto my knees
And now that I'm without your kisses
I'll be needing stitches
Tripping over myself, aching
Begging you to come help
And now that I'm without your kisses
I'll be needing stitches

[Outro]
Now that I'm without your kisses
I'll be needing stitches
Now that I'm without your kisses
I'll be needing stitches

[Verse 1: Shawn Mendes & Khalid]
Here I am, stuck on this couch scrolling through my notes
Heart was broken, still not growing, nah
Waking up to headlines, filled with devastation again
My heart is broken, but I keep going

[Pre-Chorus: Shawn Mendes with Khalid]
Pain, but I won't let it turn into  hate
No, I won't let it change me
Never losing sight of the one I keep inside
Now, I know it, yeah, I know it

[Chorus: Shawn Mendes & Khalid]
You can't take my youth away
This soul of mine will never break
As long as I wake up today
You can't take my youth away
You can't take my youth away
This soul of mine will never break
As long as I wake up today
You can't take my youth away

[Post-Chorus: Shawn Mendes & Khalid]
You can't take my youth away

[Verse 2: Shawn Mendes & Khalid]
It's hard to sleep at night, knowing what's outside
Feeling hopeless, I need focus
You hit me with words I never heard come out your mouth
To be honest, I don't want it, no

[Pre-Chorus: Shawn Mendes, & Khalid]
Pain, but I won't let it turn into hate
No, I won't let it change me

[Chorus: Shawn Mendes & Khalid]
You can't take my youth away
This soul of mine will never break
As long as I wake up today
You can't take my youth away
You can't take my youth away
This soul of mine will never break
As long as I wake up today
You can't take my youth away

[Post-Chorus: Shawn Mendes & Khalid]
You can't take my youth away 
You can't take my youth away
Oh, yeah

Pain, but I won't let it turn into hate
No, I won't let it change me
Pain, but I won't let it turn into hate
No, I won't let it change me

[Chorus: Shawn Mendes & Khalid]
You can't take my youth away
This soul of mine will never break
As long as I wake up today
You can't take my youth  away 
You can't take my youth away

You can't take my youth away
This soul of mine will never break
As long as I wake up today
You can't take my youth away
You can't take my youth away

[Verse 1]
Sunrise with you on my chest
No blinds in the place where I live
Daybreak open your eyes
'Cause this was only ever meant to be for one night
Still, we're changing our minds here
Be yours, be my dear
So close with you on my lips
Touch noses, feeling your breath
Push your heart and pull away, yeah
Be my summer in a winter day, love
I can't see one thing wrong
Between the both of us
Be mine, be mine, yeah
Anytime, anytime

[Pre-Chorus]
Ooh, you know I've been alone for quite a while, haven't I
I thought I knew it all
Found love but I was wrong
More times than enough
But since you came along
I'm thinking, baby

[Chorus]
You, are bringing out a different kind of me 
There's no safety net that's underneath
I'm free
Fallin all in you
Fell for men who weren't how they appear 
Trapped up on a tightrope now we're here
We're free
Fallin all in you

[Verse 2]
Fast forward a couple years, yeah
Grown up in the place that we live
Make love, then we fight
Laugh 'cause it was only meant to be for one night, baby
I guess we can't control
What's just not up to us
Be mine, be mine, yeah
Anytime, anytime

[Pre-Chorus]
Ooh, you know I've been alone for quite a while, haven't I
I thought I knew it all
Found love but I was wrong
More times than enough
But since you came along
I'm thinking, baby

[Chorus]
You, are bringing out a different kind of me 
There's no safety net that's underneath
I'm free
Fallin' all in you 
Fell for men who weren't how they appear 
Trapped up on a tightrope now we're here
We're free
Fallin' all in you

[Bridge]
Every time I see you, baby, I get lost
If I'm dreaming, baby, please don't wake me up
Every night I'm with you I fall more in love
Now I'm laying by your side
Everything feels right since you came along
I'm thinking, baby

[Chorus]
You, yeah, are bringing out a different kind of me 
There's no safety net that's underneath
I'm free
Fallin' all in you 
Fell for men who weren't how they appear 
Trapped up on a tightrope now we're here
We're free
Fallin' all in...

[Verse 1]
You said, "I wanna get to know ya"
Why you gotta get my hopes up?
You said that you were staying over
But then I woke up to the cold air

[Refrain]
How could you make me believe?
That there was something in between you and me, yeah
I look around and I don't see you

[Chorus]
Where were you in the morning, baby?
You didn't leave your number for me
Left me without a warning, waitin'
Where were you in the morning, baby?

[Post-Chorus]
How do you, how do you just walk away?
How do you, how do you just walk away?

[Verse 2]
And I thought you really felt this
When we were talking about breakfast
You made it seem like we connected
I guess I just didn't expect this

[Refrain]
How could you make me believe?
That there was something in between you and me, yeah
I look around and I don't see you

[Chorus]
Where were you in the morning, baby?
You didn't leave your number for me
Left me without a warning, waitin'
I said where were you in the morning, baby?

[Post-Chorus]
How do you, how do you just walk away?
Where were, where were you?
How do you, how do you just walk away?
Where were, where were you?

[Bridge]
And I hope you had a good reason
'Cause I know you had a good time
And I'm looking up at the ceiling
And I keep wondering why

[Chorus]
Where were you in the morning, baby?
Where were you in the morning?
You didn't leave your number for me
You didn't leave your number
Left me without a warning, waitin'
Left me without a warning
I said, where were you in the morning baby?
Where were you in the morning?

[Post-Chorus]
How do you, how do you just walk away?
Where were, where were you?
How do you, how do you just walk away?
Where were, where were you?
How do you, how do you just walk away?
Where were, where  were you?
How do you, how do you just walk away?
Where were, where were you?

[Verse 1]
I saw you on a Sunday in a caf
And all you did was look my way
And my heart started to race
And my hands started to shake, yeah
I heard you asked about me through a friend
My adrenaline kicked in
'Cause I've been askin' 'bout you too
And now we're right here in this room

[Chorus]
I get a little bit nervous around you
Get a little bit stressed out when I think about you
Get a little excited
Baby, when I think about you, yeah
Talk a little too much around you

Get a little self-conscious when I think about you

Get a little excited

Baby, when I think about you, yeah
Yeah, when I think about you, babe

[Verse 2]
We walked in the rain a couple blocks to your apartment
You told me to come inside, caught me staring in your eyes
And I'm not usually like this
But I like what you're doing to me, ah, what you're doing to me

[Chorus]
I get a little bit nervous around you

Get a little bit stressed out when I think about you

Get a little excited

Baby, when I think about you, yeah
Yeah, when I think about you, babe 
Talk a little too much around you

Get a little self-conscious when I think about you

Get a little excited

Baby, when I think about you
Yeah, when I think about you, babe

[Bridge]
You got me acting like I've never done this before
I promise I'll be ready when I walk through the door
And I don't know why
No, I don't know why
Yeah

[Chorus]
I get a little bit nervous around you

Get a little bit stressed out when I think about you

Get a little excited

Baby, when I think about you
Yeah, when I think about you, babe
Talk a little too much around you

Get a little self-conscious when I think about you

Get a little excited

Baby, when I think about you
Yeah, when I think about you, babe

[Verse 1]
Oh, there she goes again, every morning it's the same
You walk on by my house, I wanna call out your name
I wanna tell you how beautiful you are from where I'm standin'
You got me thinkin' what we could be 'cause

[Pre-Chorus]
I keep craving, craving, you don't know it but it's true
Can't get my mouth to say the words they wanna say to you
This is typical of love, I can't wait anymore, won't wait
I need to tell you how I feel when I see us together forever

[Chorus]
In my dreams you're with me, we'll be everything I want us to be
And from there, who knows?
Maybe this will be the night that we kiss for the first time
Or is that just me and my imagination?

[Verse 2]
We walk, we laugh, we spend our time walking by the ocean side
Our hands are gently intertwined, a feeling I just can't describe
And all this time we spent alone thinkin' we cannot belong
To something so damn beautiful, so damn beautiful

[Pre-Chorus]
I keep craving, craving, you don't know it but it's true
Can't get my mouth to say the words they wanna say to you
This is typical of love, I can't wait anymore, won't wait
I need to tell you how I feel when I see us together forever

[Chorus]
In my dreams you're with me, we'll be everything I want us to be
And from there, who knows?
Maybe this will be the night that we kiss for the first time
Or is that just me and my imagination? 

[Bridge]
Imagination 
Imagination 


[Chorus]
In my dreams you're with me, we'll be everything I want us to be
And from there, who knows?
Maybe this will be the night that we kiss for the first time
Or is that just me and my imagination?

[Outro]
I keep craving, craving, you don't know it but it's true
Can't get my mouth to say the words they wanna say to you

[Verse 1]
I love it when you just don't care
I love it when you dance like there's nobody there
So when it gets hard, don't be afraid
We don't care what them people say
I love it when you don't take no
I love it when you do what you want 'cause you just said so
Let them all go home, we out late
We don't care what them people say

[Chorus]
We don't have to be ordinary
Make your best mistakes
'Cause we don't have the time to be sorry
So baby be the life of the party
I'm telling you to take your shot it might be scary
Hearts are gonna break
'Cause we don't have the time to be sorry
So baby be the life of the party

[Verse 2]
Together we can just let go
Pretend like there's no one else here that we know
Slow dance fall in love as the club track plays
We don't care what them people say

[Chorus]
We don't have to be ordinary
Make your best mistakes
'Cause we don't have the time to be sorry
So baby be the life of the party
I'm telling you to take your shot it might be scary
Hearts are gonna break
'Cause we don't have the time to be sorry
So baby be the life of the party

[Bridge]
Come out tonight, come out tonight
There's no one standing in your way
Come out tonight, come out tonight
We don't care what them people say
We don't care what them people say

[Chorus]
We don't have to be ordinary
Make your best mistakes
'Cause we don't have the time to be sorry
So baby be the life of the party
I'm telling you to take your shot it might be scary
Hearts are gonna break
'Cause we don't have the time to be sorry
So baby be the life of the party

[Outro]
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Life of the party
So don't let them keep you down
Oh you know you can't give up
'Cause we dont have the time to be sorry
So baby be the life of the party

[Verse 1]
Taste the poison from your lips
Lately, we're as good as gone
Oh, our love is drunken in
Singing me my favorite song

[Pre-Chorus]
Me and you
We were made to break
I know the truth
But it's much too late

[Chorus]
You're perfectly wrong for me
And that's why it's so hard to leave
Yeah, you're perfectly wrong for me
You're perfectly wrong for me
All the stars in the sky could see
Why you're perfectly wrong for me

[Verse 2]
Oh, you know how much it hurts
Every time you say you hate me
But when we're making love, you make it worth it
I can't believe the places that you take me

[Pre-Chorus]
There's no use
We were made to break
I know the truth
And it's much too late

[Chorus]
You're perfectly wrong for me
And that's why it's so hard to leave
Yeah, you're perfectly wrong for me
Oh, you're perfectly wrong for me
All the stars in the sky could see
Why you're perfectly wrong for me

[Bridge]
Oh, and why can't I quit
When you break my heart open
I need you more than I know
Oh, and I can't resist
When you're up against my skin
I never wanna let you go

[Chorus]
You're perfectly wrong for me
And that's why it's so hard for me
Yeah, you're perfectly wrong for me, mhm
Yeah, you're perfectly wrong for me
Hate that you know that I won't leave
Yeah, you're perfectly wrong for me, oh
Yeah, you're perfectly wrong for me
And that's why it's so hard for me
Yeah, you're perfectly wrong for me, yeah
Oh, you're perfectly wrong for me
Hate that you know that I won't leave
Yeah, you're perfectly wrong for me
Yeah, you're perfectly wrong for me

[Verse 1]
I know a girl, she's like a curse
We want each other, no one will break first
So many nights, trying to find someone new
They don't mean nothing compared to her, and I know

[Pre-Chorus]
When people ask about us, now, we just brush it off
I don't know why we act like it means nothing at all
I wish that I could tell you that you're all that I want, yeah

[Chorus]
I pretend that
I'm not ready
Why do we put each other through hell?
Why can't we just get over ourselves?
And you say "hi" like
You just met me
Why do we put each other through hell?
Why can't we just get over ourselves?
Why can't we just get over ourselves?

[Verse 2]
When I hear you sing, it gets hard to breathe
Can't help but think every song's about me
And every line, every word that I write
You are the muse in the back of my mind, oh

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't wanna ask about it 'cause you might brush it off
I'm afraid you think that it means nothing at all
I don't know why I won't admit that you're all I want

[Chorus]
I pretend that
I'm not ready
Why do we put each other through hell?
Why can't we just get over ourselves?
And you say "hi" like
You just met me
Why do we put each other through hell?
Why can't we just get over ourselves?

[Instrumental]

[Chorus]
I pretend that
I'm not ready
Why do we put each other through hell?
Why can't we just get over ourselves?
And you say "hi" like
You just met me
Why do we put each other through hell?
Why can't we just get over ourselves?

[Outro]
I know a girl, she's like a curse
We want each other, no one will break first
So many nights, trying to find someone new
They don't mean nothing compared to you

[Verse 1: Shawn Mendes]
"Don't cry" - or do
Whatever makes you comfortable
Im tired too, there's nothin' left to say
Lets call the truce, 'cause I don't really wanna go to bed like this

[Pre-Chorus: Shawn Mendes]
I'm so sorry
That we're still stuck in the middle
I'm so sorry
'Cause in the moment I

[Chorus: Shawn Mendes & Julia Michaels]
I don't know what its like to be you
I dont know what it's like but Im dying to
If I could put myself in your shoes
Then I'd know what it's like to be you

[Verse 2: Julia Michaels]
Can I kiss you or not? 'Cause Im not really sure right now of what you want
Are you still mad at me?
I'm hopin' not
'Cause maybe we could go to the movies, I know that always cheers us up, hey

[Pre-Chorus: Shawn Mendes & Julia Michaels]
I'm so sorry
That we're still stuck in the middle
Yeah, I'm so sorry
'Cause in the moment I

[Chorus: Shawn Mendes & Julia Michaels]
I don't know what it's like to be you
I don't know what it's like but I'm dying to
If I could put myself in your shoes
Then I'd know what it's like to be you
Tell me what's inside of your head
No matter what you say I won't love you less
And I'd be lying if I said that I do
I don't know what it's like to be you
I don't know what it's like to be you

[Bridge: Shawn Mendes & Julia Michaels]
I get worried
I might lose you a little
Every time we
Every time we argue and get caught up in the moment

[Chorus: Shawn Mendes & Julia Michaels]
I don't know what it's like to be you
I don't know what it's like but I'm dying to
If I could put myself in your shoes
Then I'd know what it's like to be you
So tell me what's inside of your head
No matter what you say I won't love you less
And I'd be lying if I said that I do
I don't know what it's like to be you
I don't know what it's like to be you
I don't know what it's like

[Verse 1]
I think it's time to be honest
Should've told you not to go
Thought I knew just what I wanted
I didn't know myself at all

[Pre-Chorus]
You're with somebody I can't be, yeah
But I can tell that you're happy

[Chorus]
It's time for me to finally meet somebody new
Take her to all the places that I took us to
And she might help me forget
But loving her is something I could never do
Because I had, because I had you

[Verse 2]
Hey, remember when I told you
That you and I will go down in history together, yeah
And does your sister ask about me?
You and I, what we had, is it gone forever?

[Pre-Chorus]
You're with somebody I can't be
But I can tell that you're happy

[Chorus]
It's time for me to finally meet somebody new
Take her to all the places that I took us to
And she might help me forget but loving her is something I could never do
Because I had, because I had you

[Bridge]
There's nothin', oh
There's nothin' left to lose 
Because I had you, babe
There's nothin'
Nothin' that I could do 
I wish I had you

[Chorus]
But I think it's time I finally found somebody new
And tell myself that she's the one to get me through
And she might help me forget but loving her is something I just couldn't do
Because I had you

[Intro Whistling]

[Verse 1]
I promise that one day I'll be around
I'll keep you safe, I'll keep you sound
Right now it's pretty crazy
And I don't know how to stop or slow it down

[Pre-Chorus]
Hey, I know there are some things we need to talk about
And I can't stay, just let me hold you for a little longer now

[Chorus]
Take a piece of my heart and make it all your own
So when we are apart, you'll never be alone, you'll never be alone

[Verse 2]
You'll never be alone
When you miss me close your eyes
I may be far, but never gone
When you fall asleep tonight, just remember that we lay under the same stars

[Pre-Chorus]
Hey, I know there are some things we need to talk about
And I can't stay, just let me hold you for a little longer now

[Chorus]
And take a piece of my heart and make it all your own
So when we are apart, you'll never be alone, you'll never be alone

[Bridge]
You'll never be alone, you'll never be alone
You'll never be alone, you'll never be alone
You'll never be alone, you'll never be alone

[Chorus]
And take a piece of my heart and make it all your own
So when we are apart, you'll never be alone, you will never be alone

[Verse 1]
It's not that I'm afraid I'm not enough for her
It's not that I can't find the words to say
But when she's with him, she seems happier
And I don't want to take that away

[Pre-Chorus]
How many times can I see your face?
How many times will you walk away?
I just have to let you know

[Chorus]
I'm not tryna start a fire, with this flame
But I'm worried that your heart might feel the same
And I have to be honest with you baby
Tell me if I'm wrong, and this is crazy
But I got you this rose
And I need to know
Will you let it die or let it grow?
Die or let it go?

[Verse 2]
It's not that I don't care about the love you have
It's not that I don't want to see you smile
But there's no way that he can feel the same
'Cause when I think of you my mind goes wild

[Pre-Chorus]
How many times can I see your face?
How many times will you walk away?
I just have to let you know

[Chorus]
I'm not tryna start a fire, with this flame
But I'm worried that your heart might feel the same
And I have to be honest with you baby
Tell me if I'm wrong, this is crazy
But I got you this rose
And I need to know
Will you let it die or let it grow?

[Bridge]
You can tell me stop, if you already know
Though I'm not sure my heart can take it
But the look on your face says, don't let me go

[Chorus]
I'm not tryna start a fire, with this flame
But I'm worried that your heart might feel the same
And I have to be honest with you baby
Tell me if I'm wrong, this is crazy
But I got you this rose
And I need to know
Will you let it die or let it go?
I'm not tryna start a fire, with this flame
But I'm worried that your heart might feel the same
And I have to be honest with you baby
Tell me if I'm wrong, this is crazy
But I got you this rose
And I need to know
Will you let it die or let it grow?

[Verse 1]
Maybe I had too many drinks, but that's just what I needed
I hope that you don't think that what I'm saying sounds conceited
When I look across the room and you're staring right back at me
Like somebody told a joke and we're the only ones laughin'

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't know why I try 'cause ain't nobody like you
Familiar disappointment every single time I do
And every single night my arms are not around you
My mind's still wrapped around you

[Chorus]
Baby, tell me when you're ready
I'm waitin'
Baby, anytime you're ready
I'm waitin'
Even ten years from now, if you haven't found somebody
I promise I'll be around
Tell me when you're ready
I'm waitin'

[Verse 2]
What if my dad is right when he says that you're the one
No, I can't even argue, I won't even fight him on it
Call you when it's late and I know that you're in bed
'Cause I'm three hours back, seems like you're always six ahead

[Pre-Chorus]
And I don't know why I try 'cause ain't nobody like you
Familiar disappointment every single time I do
And every single night my arms are not around you
My mind's still wrapped around you

[Chorus]
Baby, tell me when you're ready
I'm waitin'
Baby, anytime you're ready
I'm waitin'
Even ten years from now, if you haven't found somebody
I promise I'll be around
Tell me when you're ready
I'm waitin', yeah

[Bridge]
And if I have to, I'll wait forever
Say the word and I'll change my plans
Yeah, you know that we fit together
I know your heart like the back of my hand

[Chorus]
So baby, tell me when you're ready
I'm waitin'
Baby, any time you're ready
I'm waitin', yeah
Even ten years from now, if you haven't found somebody
I promise I'll be around
Tell me when you're ready
I'm waitin', yeah
Baby, tell me when you're ready
I'm waitin'
Baby, any time you're ready
I'm waitin', oh
Even ten years from now, if you haven't found somebody
I promise I'll be around
Tell me when you're ready
I'm waitin', I'm waitin'

[Verse 1]
She got a bad reputation
She takes the long way home
And all of my friends seen her naked
Or so the story goes
Mistakes we all make them
But they won't, let it go, oh no
'Cause she's got a bad reputation
But I know what they don't

[Chorus]
And I don't care what they, say about you baby
They don't know what you've been through
Trust me I could be the one to, treat you like a lady
Let me see, what's underneath
All I need is you

[Verse 2]
She got a bad reputation
Nobody gets too close
A sight of a soul when it's breakin'
Makin' my heart grow cold
And into the deeper she's sinkin'
I'm beggin' her please, don't let go
She's got a bad reputation
But she's all that... all I want though

[Chorus]
And I don't care what they, say about you baby
They don't know what you've been through
Trust me I could be the one to, treat you like a lady
Let me see, what's underneath
All I need is you

[Bridge]
Nobody knows the way that I know her, said
Nobody knows the weight thats on her shoulders, said
Nobody knows the way that I know her, said
She got it bad, she got it bad
Nobody knows the way that I know her, said
Nobody knows the weight thats on her shoulders, said
Nobody knows the way that I know her, said
She got it bad, she got it bad

[Chorus]
And I don't care what they, say about you baby
They don't know what you've been through
Trust me I could be the one to, treat you like a lady
Let me see, what's underneath
All I need is you
And I don't care what they, say about you baby
They don't know what you've been through
Trust me I could be the one to, treat you like a lady
Let me see, what's underneath
All I need is you

[Outro]
She got a bad reputation
She takes the long way home

[Verse 1]
It's hard to believe
You don't remember me at all
Am I hard to recognize?
You say "nice to meet you" every time
Yeah, and I made you laugh
I still remember what I said
Guess I shouldn't be surprised
You say "nice to meet you" every time

[Pre-Chorus]
I know we got a lot of mutual friends
Don't say my name, don't come up in your conversations, yeah

[Chorus]
Who crowned you queen of
You think you're too cool
Making beautiful look ugly
The way you put yourself above me
You treat me
Like I got nothin' on you
Making beautiful look ugly
You ain't the ruler of no country
Who made you the queen?

[Verse 2]
I shouldn't stress about
The fact you're not impressed
Are you playing hard to get?
Or maybe you're not interested
I don't understand
Why everybody thinks you're sweet
'Cause I see the opposite
No, you're not so innocent

[Pre-Chorus]
I see the way you're lookin' through me right now
To see if there's somebody cooler around, yeah

[Chorus]
Who crowned you queen of
You think you're too cool
Making beautiful look ugly
The way you put yourself above me
You treat me
Like I got nothin' on you
Making beautiful look ugly
You ain't the ruler of no country
Who made you the queen?

[Bridge]
No, no, no, no, no
Who made you the queen?
Who made you the queen?

[Chorus]
Who crowned you queen of
You think you're too cool
Making beautiful look ugly
The way you put yourself above me 
You treat me
Like I got nothin' on you
Making beautiful look ugly 
You ain't the ruler of no country 

[Outro]
Who made you the queen?
Who made you the queen?
Yeah, you think you're too cool, no
Who made you the queen?
Who made you the queen?

[Verse 1]
I want you close to me
I want you close, I want you closer
But when you're here with me
It's hard to tell just what you're after

[Pre-Chorus]
You say, you want all of me today
But tomorrow's not the same
My feelings never change
What do you want from me?
What do you want, uh?

[Chorus]
I need to know
If this is mutual
Before I go
And get way too involved
I want you bad
Can you reciprocate?
No, I don't want to have to leave
But half of you's not enough for me

[Verse 2]
This inconsistency, what does it mean?
You got me questioning, the way you act and take it back
Do I mean anything?
Just tell me honestly

[Pre-Chorus]
You say, you want all of me today
But tomorrow's not the same
My feelings never change
What do you want from me?
What do you want, uh?

[Chorus]
I need to know
If this is mutual
Before I go
And get way too involved
I want you bad
Can you reciprocate?
No, I don't want to have to leave
But half of you's not enough for me

[Bridge]
Are you playin' me, is this a game?
When you show up late, say love at 2 A.M
Then tell me you can't stay, girl, yeah
What do you want from me?
Baby, oh

[Chorus]
I need to know
If this is mutual
Before I go
And get way too involved
I want you bad, baby
Can you reciprocate?
No, I don't want to have to leave
But half of you's not enough for me

[Verse 1]
You've got my heart, but I can't let you keep it, babe
'Cause I won't be sure that I can stay
And don't waste your time trying to pull me in
'Cause I'm just a mess you don't wanna fix
Just promise me one thing that you won't forget
But for now, kiss me softly before I say

[Chorus]
And don't be a fool
And wait on me, darling
I know that you don't wanna hear this
But I'm always on the move
And don't be a fool
And say that you love me
'Cause you'll find a man who will stand by your side
And will be there for you

[Verse 2]
And just know that I do, oh I really like you, babe
And I wanna be there for you, for the rest of your days
But I know that you'll hurt if we keep on doing this
So I'm sorry to end this now, but I know that it's for the best

[Chorus]
Don't be a fool
And wait on me, darling, yeah
I know that you don't wanna hear this
But I'm always on the move
And don't be a fool, yeah
And say that you love me
'Cause you'll find a man who will stand by your side
And will be there for you

[Bridge]
I don't think you'll ever understand
I don't think you'll ever understand
I know that you don't wanna hear this
But darling, please don't be a fool

[Chorus]
Oh, don't be a fool, yeah
And wait on me, darling
I know that you don't wanna hear this
But I'm always on the move, yeah, oh
Just don't be a fool, yeah
And say that you love me, girl
'Cause you'll find a man who will stand by your side
And will be there for you

[Outro]
And don't be a fool
And wait on me, darling
I know that you don't wanna hear this
But don't be a fool

[Verse 1]
She don't listen to a thing, 'less it feels right
Only dances when it's Kanye
She could take you one-on-one if she feels like
You'll be begging her for mercy, mercy

[Pre-Chorus]
Ooh, she'll take your name and number
Then she'll hit erase and walk away
But ooh, she's so specific when she's at my place
At my place

[Chorus]
She's got particular taste, yeah
She's so obsessed with the chase, yeah
She don't waste time on conversations, no
She just goes right for the face, yeah
She's so particular

[Verse 2]
Never pickin' up her phone 'less it rings twice
Only answers with a question, "Mhm?"
If I try to play it cool, it never goes right
Got me drownin', drownin', ah

[Pre-Chorus]
Ooh, she'll take your name and number
Then she'll hit erase and walk away
But ooh, she's so specific when she's at my place
At my place

She's so particular
I'm so obsessed with her, yeah
She's so particular
I'm so obsessed with her, yeah
She's so particular

[Bridge]
She's the best at getcha' thinkin' that she don't care
Knows exactly what she wants, uhh
Now she's runnin' all her fingers right through my hair
And it means that

[Chorus]
She's got particular taste 
She's so obsessed with the chase, yeah
She don't waste time on conversations, no
She just goes right for the face, yeah 

[Outro]
She's so particular
I'm so obsessed with her, yeah
She's so particular 
I'm so obsessed with her, yeah 
She's got particular taste

[Verse 1]
Do ya, do you think about me?
And do ya, do you feel the same way?
And do ya, do you remember how it felt?
Cause I do, so listen to me, baby

[Chorus]
And I'm not tryna ruin your happiness
But darling, don't you know that I'm the only one for ya?
And I'm not tryna ruin your happiness, baby
But darling, don't you know that I'm the only one? Yeah

Do I ever cross your mind?
Do I ever cross your mind?
Do I ever cross your mind?
Oh

[Chorus]
And I'm not tryna ruin your happiness
But darling, don't you know that I'm the only one for ya?
And I don't wanna, I don't wanna ruin your happiness, baby
But darling, don't you know that I'm the only one? Yeah

[Outro]
Oh-oh
Do I ever, said I
Do I ever, said I, do I?
Do I ever, said I
Do I ever, said I, oh-oh-oh-ohhh?
Do I ever, do I ever cross your mind?
Not tryna ruin your happiness at all

[Verse 1]
I'll pick you up at the same time
At the same place, the same old drive
We'll just talk about our day
To try to fill the awkward space tonight
We'll play the songs we used to love
While we try to fall in love again
We don't know who's wrong or right
We don't even care enough to fight

[Chorus]
We're going through the motions
Cause we can't fix what's broken
And I know it's gonna hurt
But darling I'll go first
Cause I won't keep on saying those three empty words
No, I won't keep on saying those three empty words

[Verse 2]
We're still talking everyday
I'm running out of things to say to ya
What's really gonna break my heart
Is to have to tell your little brother
It might be easier to stay
But it'll never be the same, no, oh no
And if something doesn't change
Then we'll keep on sinking further

[Chorus]
Oh, we're going through the motions 
Cause we can't fix what's broken
And I know it's gonna hurt
But darling I'll go first
Cause I won't keep on saying those three empty words

[Bridge]
Those three empty words
Will only make it worse
I'm tired, I can't take it anymore
Those three empty words
Will only make it worse
We're tired, we can't take it anymore

[Chorus]
We're going through the motions
Cause we can't fix what's broken, no
And I know it's gonna hurt
But darling I'll go first
I won't keep on saying those three empty words

[Outro]
We don't have to keep on saying those three empty words
No I can't keep on saying those three empty words

[Verse 1]
Hey, how's it going?
Can you meet me down on Adelaide Street?
Can you talk for a moment?
There's no way to say this that easily
And everything I said, I swear I meant it
I need to tell you that this isn't your fault
And I know that I'll probably regret it
And it kills me cause the worst part of all

[Verse 2]
Hey, can you listen?
I swear to God to you, there's nobody else
You're gonna say that I'm lying
When I tell you every feeling I felt
Was honest and sincere in that you were different
And when we kissed I felt like that kid in love, yeah
And I know that I'll probably regret it
I might wish I never said this at all

[Chorus]

[Verse 1]
Re-rewind Friday night, never forget it, how you let me go
No more lies, I'll be fine, know where I'm headed, probably shoulda known
And now you're gonna say, "Pretty please forgive me"
Fool me once, told you twice, gonna regret it, now you're all alone, yeah

[Chorus]
Turns out that no one can replace me
I'm permanent, you can't erase me
I'll have you remember me, one more kiss is all it takes
I'll leave you with the memory and the aftertaste

[Verse 2]
Close your eyes, you can't hide, try to forget me, but I'm everywhere
I'm the smell on your sheets you weren't ready when you left me there
And now you're gonna say, "Pretty please forgive me"
Yeah, bet it hurts it gets worse, you know nobody, said it would be fair, oh

[Chorus]
Turns out that no one can replace me
I'm permanent, you can't erase me

[Bridge]
And now there's something in your way
'Cause you threw it all to waste
And you wonder if you could take back what you did that day
And it hurts 'cause

[Chorus]
Turns out that no one can replace me
I'm permanent, you can't erase me
I'll have you remember me, one more kiss is all it takes
I'll leave you with the memory and the aftertaste
Truth is that no one can replace me
I'm permanent you can't erase me
I'll have you remember me one more kiss is all it takes
I'll leave you with the memory and the aftertaste and the aftertaste

[Verse 1]
I know that I have made mistakes
Like when I introduced you as a friend
And I pray to God it's not too late
As I'm dreaming wide awake again
Yeah, we got so close I couldn't see
Laughing while we painted my room, yeah
And all along the joke's on me
Now you're happier with someone new

[Chorus]
What if I told you a story
All about someone who loves you
And what if I told you he's sorry he made you wait
And what if I told you he's dying 'cause he can't change history
And what if I told you that someone was me

[Verse 2]
When I call you late, I know he's there
But you still pick up and leave the bed
You speak low so he can't hear
And it gives me hope there's something left

[Chorus]
What if I told you a story
All about someone who loves you
And what if I told you he's sorry he made you wait
And what if I told you he's dying 'cause he can't change history
And what if I told you that someone was me

[Verse 3]
And when you ask me who I'm seeing now
I wanna say it's you I'm thinking about
I'm tryna find the words somehow
To say the things that I never said
I'd do whatever it takes, I need to know what'd you say
Cause you've got a hold on me, yeah, you got a hold of me

[Chorus]
What if I told you a story
All about someone who loves you
And what if I told you he's sorry he made you wait
And what if I told you he's dying 'cause he can't change history
And what if I told you that someone was me

[Verse 4]
I'm ready to tell you a story
I am somebody who loves you
I wanna tell you I'm sorry
And darling just listen don't worry
We could go down in history
Why don't you let your somebody be me?

[Verse 1]
She would not show that she was afraid
But being and feeling alone was too much to face
Though everyone said that she was so strong
What they didn't know is that she could barely carry on

[Pre-Chorus]
But she knew that she would be okay
So she didn't let it get in her way

[Chorus]
Sometimes, it all gets a little too much
But you gotta realize that soon the fog will clear up
And you don't have to be afraid, because we're all the same
And we know that sometimes it all gets a little too much

[Verse 2]
She would always tell herself, she could do this
She would use no help it would be just fine
But when it got hard she would lose her focus
So take my hand, it will be alright

[Pre-Chorus]
And she knew that she would be okay
So she didn't let it get in her way

[Chorus]
Sometimes, it all gets a little too much
But you gotta realize that soon the fog will clear up
And you don't have to be afraid, because we're all the same
And we know that sometimes it all gets a little too much, yeah

[Bridge]
A little too much
I said a little too much, oh

[Chorus]
Sometimes, it all gets a little too much
But you gotta realize that soon the fog will clear up
And you don't have to be afraid, because we're all the same
And we know that sometimes it all gets a little too much

[Chorus]
Sometimes, it all gets a little too much
But you gotta realize that soon the fog will clear up
And you don't have to be afraid, because we're all the same
And we know that sometimes it all gets a little too much

[Verse 1]
You hit me up, it's late at night
This is the same old story
Your friends should take your phone away
I always give in when you tell me lies to reassure me
I always make the same mistakes, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
Ooh, you give me a little taste
Lure me in, then you take it from me
Oh, I hate that I love it
'Cause you're driving me crazy

[Chorus]
First you say you love me, then you say you dont
I wake up in the mornin', and I'm all alone
Tell me that you willing, then you say you won't
Can you make your mind up?
Please, I'm losin' my patience
You know I'm losin' my patience, yeah

[Verse 2]
I'm in your room, it's just us two
I feel you getting closer
You rest your head upon my chest, yeah
Deep down I know that this should be the last time I come over
You always leave me such a mess

[Pre-Chorus]
Ooh, you give me a little taste
Lure me in, then you take it from me
Oh, I hate that I love it
'Cause you're driving me crazy

[Chorus]
First you say you love me, then you say you dont
I wake up in the mornin', and I'm all alone
Tell me that you willing, then you say you won't
Can you make your mind up?
Please I'm losin' my patience
You know I'm losin' my patience, yeah

[Bridge]
And you gotta stop, if you know
So I can start, letting go
'Cause it's drivin' me crazy
Yeah, you keep drivin' me crazy

[Chorus]
When you say you love me, then you say you dont
I wake up in the mornin', and I'm all alone
Tell me that you willing, then you say you won't
Yeah, you're driving me crazy

[Outro]
First you say you love me, then you say you dont
I wake up in the mornin', and I'm all alone
Tell me that you willing, then you say you won't
Can you make your mind up?
Please I'm losin' my patience
You know I'm losin' my patience, yeah
Please, I'm losing my patience, yeah

[Verse 1]
Am I asking all these questions for nothing?
I'm wondering if anyone's there, yeah
And I really need to make a confession
I hate to say that I'm a little bit scared, yeah-eh-ehh

[Chorus]
'Cause I've been on this train too long
People getting off and on
Prayin' that I don't forget where I belon-ong
And every time I ask myself
Am I turnin' into someone else?
I'm prayin' that I don't forget just who I am-am
I really wanna understand
I just wanna understand

[Verse 2]
I'm callin' all my friends after midnight, yeah
To remind 'em that I'll always be there for them
It gets lonely when there's no one to talk to
But it's good to know that somebody care-ares

[Chorus]
'Cause I've been on this train too long
People gettin' off and on
I'm prayin' that I don't forget where I belon-ong
And every time I ask myself
Am I turnin' into someone else?
I'm prayin' that I don't forget just who I am-am
I really wanna understand
I just wanna understand, yeah
Oh yeah-eh-ehh

[Bridge]
'Cause we all get lost sometimes, yeah-eh I know
Yeah we all get lost sometimes
But don't leave your heart behind, no yeah-eh
'Cause we all get lost sometimes
I really wanna understand
I just gotta understand, yeah-ehh-ehhh
Now I just need to, I need to understand
I really wanna understand, ohh, who I am

[Interlude]
When you wake up, your whole world's flipped
It's just different, and you gotta, you know you gotta, you gotta go with it
And, that's just simply growing up
And not see it in a negative way
You have to see it as it's been given to you
I mean, as much as times can be crazy
You're gonna feel like that's where you're supposed to be
You're not going to feel out of place anymore
You're going to feel like that's where you meant to be
You don't have to pretend that it's easy all the time
You just let it go, and, and grow with it
And you can't hold on, to the old you, or the old this, or the old that
Because, you know, you change, and it's not changing in a bad way
It's just changing because that's what happens in life
You grow up, everyone moves on
You're just learning
You stay true to yourself
Changing isn't a bad thing, it never was
But at the end of the day, you know?
You're the same person
And, and where your heart is
That doesn't change

[Chorus]
And every time I ask myself
Am I turning into someone else?
And I just pray to God that I'm still who I am-am
I really wanna understand
I just gotta understand, yeah-eh-ehhhh-ehhh-ehhhhh
Now I just need to, I need to understand
I really wanna understand, ohh, who I am

[Verse 1]
You say it's not supposed to be
Tell me not to waste my time
This was never up to me
But if it was I wouldn't mind
And I'm trying to ignore you
I try to go on with my day, hey
But I still pick up the phone, yeah
And get lost in what you say

[Chorus]
I can try to stop it, all I like
Hands down I've lost this fight
Thought I was strong, enough for you
But I just can't hide the truth
So I guess I'm going down
I guess I'm going down, like this

[Verse 2]
And I love it how she's honest
You don't find that nowadays
She's not even drop dead gorgeous
But she kills me anyway, oh

[Chorus]
I can try to stop it, all I like
Hands down I've lost this fight
Thought I was strong, enough for you
But I just can't hide the truth

[Bridge]
I guess I'm going down
I guess I'm going down
I guess I'm going down like this

[Chorus]
I can try to stop it, all I like
Hands down I've lost this fight
Thought I was strong, enough for you
But I just can't hide the truth

[Outro]
I can try to stop it, all I like
Hands down I've lost this fight
And I thought I was strong, enough for you
But I just can't hide the truth
So I guess I'm going down, like this

[Verse 1]
Damn, you look so good with your clothes on
And I'm not trying to come off too strong
But you know that I can't help It
Cause girl you're beautiful
I can't deny I want your body
But I'm a gentleman so I'll be
The one who takes it slowly
Cause girl you're so beautiful

[Chorus]
I wanna love you with the lights on
Keep you up all night long
Darling, I wanna see every inch of you
I get lost in the way you move
I wanna love you with the lights on
And hold you 'til the nights gone
Darling, I wanna see every inch of you
I get lost in the way you move
I wanna love you with the lights on
Hey, hey, no

[Verse 2]
I like the vibe in this hotel room
And I'd really like to get to know you
Start discovering your secrets
Underneath these very sheets
Your skin's so perfect up against me
Your lips are talking when we don't speak
And I never wanna leave this
Cause there's so much left to see

[Chorus]
I wanna love you with the lights on
Keep you up all night long
Darling, I wanna see every inch of you
I get lost in the way you move
I wanna love you with the lights on
And hold you 'til the nights gone
Darling, I wanna see every inch of you
I get lost in the way you move
I wanna love you with the lights on
Keep you up all night long
Darling, I wanna see every inch of you
I get lost in the way you move
I wanna love you with the lights on
Hold you 'til the nights gone
Darling, I wanna see every inch of you
I get lost in the way you move
I wanna love you with the lights on
Keep you up all night long
Darling, I wanna see every inch of you
I get lost in the way you move
I wanna love you with the lights on 
And hold you 'til the nights gone
Darling, I wanna see every inch of you
I get lost in the way you move
I wanna love you with the lights on
Love you with the lights on
Love you with the lights on

[Verse 1]
I want to go back, forget that it's over
Paint it in black, when you left me alone
I never knew, she was sleeping next door with the kid I grew up with
And I can't go back to her anymore, no more

[Chorus]
You tell me you were happier with him, but you want me to stay
And you tell me that you needed time but you pushed me away
And when you try to take me back, my heavy heart just breaks
No I can't lift the weight

[Verse 2]
Put you in the past, try to forget you cause it's over
And every time you ask I'll pretend I'm okay
You're inside my head in the middle of the night
When I don't feel right, I dream I can hold you
And I can't go back to you anymore, yeah, yeah

[Chorus 2]
You tell me you were happier with him, but you want me to stay
And you tell me that you needed time but you pushed me away
And when you try to take me back, my heavy heart just breaks
But, I can't lift the weight, and I can't lift the weight

[Bridge]
And I can't lift the weight, no I can't lift the weight
Yeah, you stand on my shoulders and my heart just breaks
And I can't lift the weight, no I can't lift the weight
Yeah, you stand on my shoulders and my heart just breaks
And I can't lift the weight, no I can't lift the weight
Yeah, you lower your standards and I raise the stakes
And I can't lift the weight, no I can't lift the weight

[Chorus 3]
You tell me you were happier with him but you want me to stay
And you tell me that you needed time but you, you pushed me away
And when you try to take me back, my heavy heart just breaks
But, I can't lift the weight, and I can't lift the weight
You tell me you were happier with him, you want me to stay
You told me that you needed time but you, you pushed me away
And when you try to take me back
You say someday you will change, but I don't wanna wait

[Verse 1]
Staring out my hotel window
Too much on my mind
Maybe we should keep it simple
We don't have to decide

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh no, we don't need to overcomplicate it
Cause I've been here once before don't even say It

[Chorus]
Baby please no promises
Cause we won't keep our promises
And I know the consequences
So baby please, baby please no promises

[Verse 2]
I've never been a fan of heartbreak
So tell me what you want
Take my hands across your body
We don't have to hold on

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh no, we don't need to overcomplicate it
Cause I've been here once before, don't even say It

[Chorus]
Baby please no promises
Cause we won't keep our promises
And I know the consequences
So baby please, baby please no promises

[Bridge]
Cause I've been living only for this moment
And I don't wanna let it slip away
I've been living only for this moment
And I don't know how much that I can take, yeah

[Chorus]
Baby please no promises
Cause we won't keep our promises
And I know the consequences
So baby please, baby please no promises
Yeah baby, please no promises
Baby please no promises
Baby please
Baby please no promises

[Intro]
One, two, three, four...
Oh, woah, woah, oh, woah
Oh, woah, woah, oh, woah

[Verse 1]
Play the Lotto, you might win it
It's like 25 to life so you bust outta prison
Something's in the air, something's in the air
It's like that feeling when you're just about to kill it
Take your last shot, you know you're gonna hit it
Something's in the air, something's in the air, woah

[Chorus]
Something big, I feel it happening
Out of my control
Pushing, pulling and it's grabbing me
Feel it in my bones
Like oh, woah, woah, oh, woah
Something big, I feel it happening
Oh, woah, woah, oh, woah
Something big

[Verse 2]
It's like that feeling when you're about to win the medal
And you worked so hard, that you knew you wouldn't settle
Hands are in the air, hands are in the air
When they hear you when you thought they wouldn't listen
It's like an anthem that the whole world's singing
Hands are in the air, hands are in the air, woah

[Chorus]
Something big, I feel it happening
Out of my control
Pushing, pulling and it's grabbing me
Feel it in my bones
Like oh, woah, woah, oh, woah
Something big, I feel it happening
Oh, woah, woah, oh, woah
Something big

[Bridge]
Woah, yeah, yeah
If we stomp our feet, the ground will shake
If we clap our hands, the walls will break
Yell so loud, won't forget our names
'Cause something big is happening
Take this spark and start a fire
Raise this up, we're feeling higher
They can't tell us anything
Something big is happening

[Chorus]
Something big, I feel it happening
Out of my control
Pushing, pulling and it's grabbing me
Feel it in my bones
Like oh, woah, woah, oh, woah
Something big is happening, oh
Oh, woah, woah, oh, woah
Something big, I feel it happening, oh

[Verse 1]
Stop, take it in
And I breathe for a minute
I think too much when I'm alone
I never win when I
Keep all my thoughts inside
So I'll pick up the phone

[Pre-Chorus]
And my dad says, "Shawn, stay with me
Everything will be alright
I know I havent seen you lately
But youre always on my mind"

[Chorus]
I don't know what
Youre going through
But theres so much life
Ahead of you
And it wont slow down
No matter what you do
So you just gotta hold on
All we can do is hold on, yeah

[Verse 2]
These days are flying by
Weeks feel like minutes
I can't remember being small
I try to figure it out
I can't seem to find out how
I guess I don't know much at all

[Pre-Chorus]
And my dad says
"Shawn, stay with me
Everything will be alright
I know I havent seen you lately
But youre always on my mind"

[Chorus]
I don't know what
Youre going through
But theres so much life
Ahead of you

Yeah, you just gotta hold on
Just, just hold on
Just hold on for me

[Pre-Chorus]
And my dad says

Everything will be alright."

[Chorus]
I don't know what
Youre going through
But theres so much life
Ahead of you
And it wont slow down
No matter what you do
So you just gotta hold on
All we can do is hold on, yeah
Yeah, you just gotta hold on
Just hold on for me

[Verse 1]
When I wake up to your footsteps
As you get up out of bed
They make a song that sounds so simple
But it dances in my head
A melody so perfect
That it gets me through the day
And the thought of us forever
Is one that won't ever go away

[Pre-Chorus]
All I need to know is
Where to start
Take my hand and show me forever
So never will I ever let you go

[Verse 2]
So let's hold on together
To this paper and this pen
And write down every letter
To every word we've ever said

[Pre-Chorus]
All I need to know is
Where to start
Take my hand and show me forever
So never will I ever let you go

[Chorus]
Let's write our story
And let's sing our song
Let's hang our pictures on the wall
All these precious moments
That we carved in stone
Are only memories after all
Memories after all
Memories after all

[Bridge]
You know
You gave me hope
But I've got to let go
I've got to let go, oh
It's taking its toll
Deep in my soul
Now I've got to let go

[Outro]
We wrote our story
And we sang our songs
We hung our pictures on the wall
Now those precious moments
That we carved in stone
Are only memories after all

[Intro]
High, high hopes

[Chorus]
Had to have high, high hopes for a living
Shooting for the stars when I couldn't make a killing
Didn't have a dime but I always had a vision
Always had high, high hopes 
Had to have high, high hopes for a living
Didn't know how but I always had a feeling
I was gonna be that one in a million
Always had high, high hopes

[Verse 1]
Mama said, fulfill the prophecy
Be something greater, go make a legacy
Manifest destiny, back in the days
We wanted everything, wanted everything
Mama said, burn your biographies
Rewrite your history, light up your wildest dreams
Museum victories, every day
We wanted everything, wanted everything

[Pre-Chorus]
Mama said don't give up, it's a little complicated
All tied up, no more love and I'd hate to see you waiting

[Chorus]
Had to have high, high hopes for a living
Shooting for the stars when I couldn't make a killing
Didn't have a dime but I always had a vision
Always had high, high hopes
Had to have high, high hopes for a living
Didn't know how but I always had a feeling
I was gonna be that one in a million
Always had high, high hopes 

[Verse 2]
Mama said, it's uphill for oddities
The stranger crusaders, ain't ever wannabes
The weird and the novelties don't ever change
We wanted everything, wanted everything 

[Bridge]
Stay up on that rise
Stay up on that rise and never come down, oh
Stay up on that rise
Stay up on that rise and never come down

[Pre-Chorus]
Mama said don't give up, it's a little complicated
All tied up, no more love and I'd hate to see you waiting
They say it's all been done but they haven't seen the best of me-eh-eh-eh
So I got one more run and it's gonna be a sight to see-eh-eh-eh

[Bridge]
Had to have high, high hopes for a living
Shooting for the stars when I couldn't make a killing
Didn't have a dime but I always had a vision
Always had high, high hopes 
Had to have high, high hopes for a living
Didn't know how but I always had a feeling
I was gonna be that one in a million
Always had high, high hopes 

[Chorus]
Had to have high, high hopes for a living
Shooting for the stars when I couldn't make a killing
Didn't have a dime but I always had a vision
Always had high, high hopes
Had to have high, high hopes for a living
Didn't know how but I always had a feeling
I was gonna be that one in a million
Always had high, high hopes [Click here to read about Panic! At The Disco's first live performance of I Write Sins Not Tragedies]

[Instrumental Intro]

[Verse 1]
Oh, well, imagine
As I'm pacing the pews in a church corridor
And I can't help but to hear
No, I can't help but to hear an exchanging of words
"What a beautiful wedding!
What a beautiful wedding!, says a bridesmaid to a waiter
"And yes, but what a shame, what a shame
The poor groom's bride is a whore"

[Chorus]
I chime in with a "Haven't you people ever heard of
Closing the goddamn door?!"
No, it's much better to face these kinds of things
With a sense of poise and rationality
I chime in, "Haven't you people ever heard of
Closing the goddamn door?!"
No, it's much better to face these kinds of things
With a sense of...

[Verse 2]
Oh, well, in fact
Well, I'll look at it this way, I mean technically our
Marriage is saved, well, this calls for a toast
So pour the champagne
Oh! Well, in fact
Well, I'll look at it this way, I mean technically our
Marriage is saved, well, this calls for a toast
So pour the champagne, pour the champagne

[Chorus]
I chime in with a "Haven't you people ever heard of
Closing the goddamn door?!"
No, it's much better to face these kinds of things
With a sense of poise and rationality
I chime in, "Haven't you people ever heard of
Closing the goddamn door?!"
No, it's much better to face these kinds of things
With a sense of poise and rationality

[Bridge]
Again...

[Chorus]
I chime in "Haven't you people ever heard of
Closing the goddamn door?!"
No, it's much better to face these kinds of things
With a sense of poise and rationality
I chime in, "Haven't you people ever heard of
Closing the goddamn door?!"
No, it's much better to face these kinds of things
With a sense of poise and rationality

[Verse 1]
Do I look lonely? I see the shadows on my face
People have told me I don't look the same
Maybe I lost weight, I'm playing hooky with the best of the best
Pull my heart out my chest, so that you can see it too

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm walking the long road, watching the sky fall
The lace in your dress tangles my neck, how do I live?

[Chorus]
The death of a bachelor, o-o-oh! Letting the water fall
The death of a bachelor, o-o-oh! Seems so fitting for
Happily ever after, whooo, how could I ask for more?
A lifetime of laughter, at the expense of the death of a bachelor

[Verse 2]
I'm cutting my mind off, feels like my heart is going to burst
Alone at a table for two, and I just wanna be served
And when you think of me, am I the best you've ever had?
Share one more drink with me, smile even though you're sad

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm walking the long road, watching the sky fall
The lace in your dress tangles my neck, how do I live?

[Chorus]
The death of a bachelor, o-o-oh! Letting the water fall
The death of a bachelor, o-o-oh! Seems so fitting for
Happily ever after, whooo, how could I ask for more?
A lifetime of laughter at the expense of the death of a bachelor

[Instrumental Bridge]

[Chorus]
The death of a bachelor, o-o-oh! Letting the water fall

Happily ever after, whooo, how could I ask for more?

[Intro]

Finders keepers, losers weepers


[Verse 1]
Welcome to the end of eras, ice has melted back to life
Done my time and served my sentence
Dress me up and watch me die
If it feels good, tastes good, it must be mine
Dynasty decapitated, you just might see a ghost tonight

[Pre-Chorus]

And if you don't know, now you know

[Chorus]
I'm taking back the crown
I'm all dressed up and naked
I see what's mine and take it
, oh yeah
The crown, so close, I can taste it
I see what's mine and take it
, oh yeah


[Verse 2]
Sycophants on velvet sofas
Lavish mansions, vintage wine
I am so much more than royal
Snatch your chain and mace your eyes
If it feels good, tastes good, it must be mine
Heroes always get remembered
But you know legends never die

[Pre-Chorus]

And if you don't know, now you know

[Chorus]
I'm taking back the crown
I'm all dressed up and naked
I see what's mine and take it
, oh, yeah
The crown, so close, I can taste it
I see what's mine and take it
, oh, yeah

[Bridge]
Mortal kings are ruling castles
Welcome to my world of fun
Liars settle into sockets
Flip the switch and watch them run
Oh, yeah, oh, oh, oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh


[Chorus]
I'm taking back, back, taking back, back the crown
I'm all dressed up and naked
I see what's mine and take it
, oh, yeah
The crown, so close, I can taste it
I see what's mine and take it
, oh, yeah

[Click here to read how Panic! At The Disco wrote This Is Gospel]

[Verse 1]
This is gospel, for the fallen ones
Locked away in permanent slumber
Assembling their philosophies
From pieces of broken memories

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
This is the beat of my heart, this is the beat of my heart
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
This is the beat of my heart, this is the beat of my heart
The gnashing teeth and criminal tongues conspire against the odds
But they haven't seen the best of us yet

[Chorus]
If you love me let me go 
If you love me let me go 
'Cause these words are knives that often leave scars
The fear of falling apart
And truth be told I never was yours
The fear, the fear of falling apart

[Post-Chorus]
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
This is the beat of my heart, this is the beat of my heart
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
This is the beat of my heart, this is the beat of my...

[Verse 2]
This is gospel for the vagabonds
Ne'er-do-wells and insufferable bastards
Confessing their apostasies
Led away by imperfect impostors

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh 
This is the beat of my heart, this is the beat of my heart
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh 
This is the beat of my heart, this is the beat of my...
Don't try to sleep through the end of the world and bury me alive
'Cause I won't give up without a fight

[Chorus]
If you love me let me go 
If you love me let me go 
'Cause these words are knives that often leave scars
The fear of falling apart
And truth be told I never was yours
The fear, the fear of falling apart

[Post-Chorus]

The fear of falling apart

The fear, the fear of falling apart


The fear of falling apart


The fear of falling apart


The fear of falling apart


The fear of falling apart

[Intro]
Cold open

[Chopped Vocals]

[Verse 1]
Been trav'lin' in packs that I can't carry anymore
Been waitin' for somebody else to carry me
There's nothin' that's there for me at my door
All the people I know aren't who they used to be
And if I try to change my life one more day
There would be nobody else to save
And I can't change into a person I don't wanna be, so
Oh, it's Saturday night, yeah

[Chorus]
I pray for the wicked on the weekend
Mama, can I get another amen?
Oh, oh, it's Saturday night, yeah
Swear to God, I ain't ever gonna repent
Mama, can I get another amen?
Oh, oh, it's Saturday night, yeah

[Chopped Interlude]

[Verse 2]
And every mornin' when I wake up
I wanna be who I couldn't say I'd ever been
But it's so much more than I ever was
If every night I go to sleep knowin'
That I gave everything that I had to give
Then it's all I could've asked for
I've been standing up beside everything I've ever said, but
Oh, it's Saturday night, yeah

[Chorus]
I pray for the wicked on the weekend
Mama, can I get another amen?
Oh, oh, it's Saturday night, yeah
Swear to God, I ain't ever gonna repent
Mama, can I get another amen?
Oh, oh, it's Saturday night, yeah

[Bridge]
If I had one more day to wish
If I had one more day
To be better than I could have ever been
If I had one more day to wish
If I had one more day
I could be better, but, baby
Oh, it's Saturday night, yeah

[Chorus]
I pray for the wicked on the weekend
Mama, can I get another amen?
Oh, oh, it's Saturday night, yeah
Swear to God, I ain't ever gonna repent
Mama, can I get another amen?

Swear to God, swear to God, swear to God
Oh, oh, it's Saturday night, yeah

[Verse 1]
I don't want to hear you got a boyfriend
Sometimes you're better off alone
But if you change your mind you know where I am
Yeah, if you change your mind you know where to find me
But I don't ever want to be your boyfriend

[Pre-Chorus]
And never did I think that I would be caught in the way you got me
Push another girl aside and just give in

[Chorus]
Girls love girls and boys, sophisticated, manipulated
Girls love girls and boys, sophisticated, manipulated
And never did I think that I would be caught in the way you got me
But girls love girls and boys, and love is not a choice

[Verse 2]
Pose, you've gotta save your reputation
They're close to finding out about your girlfriend
But if you change your mind you know where I am
Yeah, if you change your mind you know where to find me
But I don't want to save your reputation

[Pre-Chorus]
And never did I think that I would be caught in the way you got me
Push another girl aside and just give in

[Chorus]
Girls love girls and boys, sophisticated, manipulated
Girls love girls and boys, sophisticated, manipulated
And never did I think that I would be caught in the way you got me
But girls love girls and boys, and love is not a choice

[Bridge]
I'm just a villain vying for attention from a girl
A girl who can't decide, and here's the reason why

[Chorus]
Girls love girls and boys, sophisticated, manipulated
Girls love girls and boys, sophisticated, manipulated
Girls love girls and boys, sophisticated, manipulated
Girls love girls and boys, sophisticated, manipulated
And never did I think that I would be caught in the way you got me
But girls love girls and boys, and love is not a choice

Tonight we are victorious
Champagne pouring over us
All my friends we're glorious
Tonight we are victorious
Oh-oh-oh-oh, victorious
Oh-oh-oh-oh

[Verse 1]
Double bubble disco queen headed to the guillotine
Skin as cool as Steve McQueen, let me be your killer king
It hurts until it stops, we will love until it's not
I'm a killing spree in white, eyes like broken Christmas lights

[Pre-Chorus]
My touch is black and poisonous
And nothing like my punch-drunk kiss
I know you need it, do you feel it?
Drink the water, drink the wine

[Chorus]
Oh we gotta turn up the crazy
Livin' like a washed-up celebrity
Shooting fireworks like it's the Fourth of July
Until we feel alright
Until we feel alright

[Verse 2]
I'm like a scarf trick, it's all up the sleeve
I taste like magic, waves that swallow quick and deep
Throw the bait, catch the shark, bleed the water red
Fifty words for murder and I'm every one of them

[Pre-Chorus]
My touch is black and poisonous
And nothing like my punch-drunk kiss
I know you need it, do you feel it?
Drink the water, drink the wine

[Chorus]
Oh we gotta turn up the crazy
Livin' like a washed-up celebrity
Shooting fireworks like it's the Fourth of July

Tonight we are victorious
Champagne pouring over us
All my friends we're glorious

Livin' like a washed-up celebrity
Shooting fireworks like it's the Fourth of July
Until we feel alright
Until we feel alright

[Outro]
Tonight we are victorious
Champagne pouring over us
All my friends we're glorious
Tonight we are victorious

[Verse 1]
You got two black eyes from loving too hard
And a black car that matches your blackest soul
I wouldn't change ya, oh
Wouldn't ever try to make you leave, no
Oh, the neon coast was your sign
And the Midwest wind with Pisces rising
Wouldn't change ya, oh
Wouldn't ever try to make you leave, no

[Pre-Chorus]
Static palms melt your vibe
Midnight whisperings

[Chorus]
The black magic on Mulholland Drive
Swimming pools under desert skies
Drinking white wine in the blushing light
Just another LA Devotee
Sunsets on the evil eye
Invisible to the Hollywood shrine
Always on the hunt for a little more time
Just another LA Devotee

[Post-Chorus]
Just another, just another, uh oh
Just another, just another, uh oh
Just another, just another, uh oh
Just another LA Devotee

[Verse 2]
You got bleached out eyes from the valley sand
And a black tar palm keeps weeping your name
I couldn't change ya, oh
Couldn't ever try to make you see, no
The high rise lights that read your rights
And a downtown storm with Aries rising
Couldn't change ya, oh
Couldn't ever try to make you see, no

[Pre-Chorus]
Static palms melt your vibe
Midnight whisperings

[Chorus]
The black magic on Mulholland Drive
Swimming pools under desert skies
Drinking white wine in the blushing light
Just another LA Devotee
Sunsets on the evil eye
Invisible to the Hollywood shrine
Always on the hunt for a little more time
Just another LA Devotee

Just another, just another, uh oh
Just another, just another, uh oh
Just another, just another, uh oh
Just another LA Devotee

Swimming pools under desert skies
Drinking white wine in the blushing light
Just another LA Devotee
Sunsets on the evil eye
Invisible to the Hollywood shrine
Always on the hunt for a little more time
Just another LA Devotee

[Post-Chorus]
Just another, just another, uh oh
Just another, just another, uh oh
Just another, just another, uh oh
Just another LA Devotee

[Verse 1]
Broadway is black like a sinkhole
Everyone raced to the suburbs
And I'm on the rooftop with curious strangers
This is the oddest of summers
Maybe I'll medicate, maybe inebriate
Strange situations, I get anxious
Maybe I'll smile a bit, maybe the opposite
But pray that they don't call me thankless

[Pre-Chorus]
My Tell-Tale Heart's a hammer in my chest
Cut me a silk tie tourniquet

[Chorus]
This is my roaring, roaring 20s
I don't even know me
Roll me like a blunt 'cause I wanna go home
Roll me like a blunt 'cause I wanna go home
My roaring, roaring 20s
I don't even know me
Roll me like a blunt 'cause I wanna go home
Roll me like a blunt 'cause I want, I wanna go home

[Verse 2]
Oscars and Emmys and Grammys
Everyone here is a trophy
And I'm sipping bourbon
The future's uncertain
The past on the pavement below me
Maybe I'll elevate, maybe I'm second rate
So unaware of my status
Maybe I'm overjoyed, maybe I'm paranoid
Designer me up in straight jackets

[Pre-Chorus]
My Tell-Tale Heart's a hammer in my chest
Cut me a silk tie tourniquet

[Chorus]
This is my roaring, roaring 20s
I don't even know me
Roll me like a blunt 'cause I wanna go home
Roll me like a blunt 'cause I wanna go home
My roaring, roaring 20s
I don't even know me
Roll me like a blunt 'cause I wanna go home
Roll me like a blunt 'cause I want, I wanna go home

[Bridge]
Hallucinations only mean that your brain is on fire
If it's Lord of the Flies in my mind tonight
I don't know if I will survive
Lighters up if you're feeling me
Fade to black if you're not mine
'Cause I just need a sign or a signal inside

[Chorus]
This is my roaring, roaring 20s
I don't even know me
Roll me a blunt 'cause I wanna go home
Roll me a, roll me a blunt
This is my roaring, roaring 20s
I don't even know me
Roll me like a blunt 'cause I wanna go home
Roll me like a blunt 'cause I want, I wanna go home

[Outro]
Oh-woah
Oh-woah
I wanna go home[Audio sample from The B-52's "Rock Lobster"]

Alright, alright
Alright, alright
Alright, alright, it's a Hell of a feeling though
It's a Hell of a feeling though
Alright, alright, it's a Hell of a feeling though
It's a Hell of a feeling though

[Verse 1]
Who are these people?
I just woke up in my underwear
No liquor left on the shelf
I should probably introduce myself
You shoulda' seen what I wore
I had a cane and a party hat
I was the king of this hologram
Where there's no such thing as getting out of hand
Memories tend to just pop up
Drunk pre-meds and some rubber gloves
Five-thousand people with designer drugs
Don't think I'll ever get enough


[Audio sample from B52's "Rock Lobster"]

[Chorus]
Champagne, cocaine, gasoline
And most things in between
I roam the city in a shopping cart
A pack of camels and a smoke alarm
This night is heating up
Raise Hell and turn it up
Saying "If you go on, you might pass out in a drain pipe"
Oh yeah, don't threaten me with a good time

[Hook]
It's a Hell of a feeling though
It's a Hell of a feeling though
Alright, alright
It's a Hell of a feeling though
It's a Hell of a feeling though

[Verse 2]
What are these footprints?
They don't look very human-like
Now I wish that I could find my clothes
Bedsheets and a morning rose
I wanna wake up
Can't even tell if this is a dream
How did we end up in my neighbor's pool
Upside-down with a perfect view?
Bar to bar at the speed of sound
Fancy feet dancing through this town
Lost my mind in a wedding gown
Don't think I'll ever get it now


[Chorus]
Champagne, cocaine, gasoline
And most things in between
I roam the city in a shopping cart
A pack of camels and a smoke alarm
This night is heating up
Raise Hell and turn it up
Saying "If you go all out you might pass out in a drain pipe"
Oh yeah, don't threaten me with a good time

[Bridge]
I'm a scholar and a gentleman
And I usually don't fall when I try to stand
I lost a bet to a guy in a Chiffon skirt
But I make these high heels work
I told you time and time again
I'm not as think as you drunk I am
And we all fell down
When the sun came up
I think we've had enough

[Hook]
Alright, alright, it's a Hell of a feeling though
It's a Hell of a feeling though
Alright, alright, it's a Hell of a feeling though

And most things in between
I roam the city in a shopping cart
A pack of camels and a smoke alarm
This night is heating up
Raise Hell and turn it up
Saying "If you go all out you might pass out in a drain pipe"
Oh yeah, don't threaten me with a good time

[Verse 1]
All my life, been hustlin', and tonight is my appraisal
'Cause I'm a hooker sellin' songs, and my pimp's a record label
This world is full of demons, stocks and bonds and bible traders
So I do the deed, get up and leave, a climber and a sadist, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
Are you ready for the sequel?
Ain't ready for the latest?
In the garden of evil
I'm gonna be the greatest
In a golden cathedral
I'll be praying for the faithless
And if you lose, boo-hoo

[Chorus]
Hey look ma, I made it, hey look ma, I made it
Everything's comin' up aces, aces
If its a dream, don't wake me, don't wake me
I said, Hey look ma, I made it

[Verse 2]
Friends are happy for me or they're honeysuckle phonies
Then they celebrate my medals or they wanna take my trophies
Some are loyal soldiers while these other thorns are rosy
And if you never know who you can trust, then trust me, you'll be lonely, oh

[Pre-Chorus]
Are you ready for the sequel?
Ain't you ready for the latest?
In the garden of evil
I'm gonna be the greatest
In a golden cathedral
I'll be praying for the faithless
And if you lose, boo-hoo

[Chorus]
Hey look ma, I made it
Hey look ma, I made it
Everything's comin' up aces, aces
If it's a dream, don't wake me, don't wake me
I said, Hey look ma, I made it, I made it
I said, Hey look ma, I made it, I made it
I see it, I want it, I take it, take it
If it's a dream, don't wake me, don't wake me

[Outro]
I said, Hey look ma, I made it

Hey look ma, I made it

Hey look ma, I made it

Hey look ma, I made it

Hey look ma, I made it

[Verse 1]
Heaven knows that I'm born too late
For these ghosts that I chase
With these dreams, I inflate, painted skies in my brain
Every day, I'm Carl Sagan in space
To escape this old world, this old world
Some days I lie wide awake 'til the sun hits my face
And I fade, elevate from the Earth
Far away to a place where I'm free from the weight
This old world, this old world

[Pre-Chorus]
I don't trust anything
Or anyone, below the sun
And I don't feel anything
At all

[Chorus]
I'm king of the clouds, of the clouds
I get lifted, I get lifted
King of the clouds, of the clouds
I get lifted, I get lifted

[Verse 2]
Some only live to die, I'm alive to fly higher
Than angels in outfields inside of my mind
I'm ascendin' these ladders, I'm climbin', say goodbye
This old world, this old world
And when I fall to rise with stardust in my eyes
In the backbone of night, I'm combustible
Dust in the fire when I can't sleep a wink, I'm too tired
This old world, this old world

[Pre-Chorus]
I don't trust anything
Or anyone, below the sun
I don't feel anything
At all

[Chorus]
I'm king of the clouds, of the clouds
I get lifted, I get lifted
King of the clouds, of the clouds
I get lifted, I get lifted
Imagination, take me somewhere I don't know
I'm lost but I better find it alone
King of the clouds, of the clouds
I get lifted, I get lifted

[Outro]
I keep searching
Oh, I keep searching
I keep searching

[Verse 1]
The moment you arrived, they built you up
The sun was in your eyes, you couldn't believe it
Riches all around, you're walking
Stars are on the ground, you start to believe it

[Pre-Chorus]
Every face along the boulevard
Is a dreamer just like you
You looked at death in a tarot card
And you saw what you had to do

[Chorus]
But nobody knows you now, when you're dying in LA
And nobody owes you now, when you're dying in LA
When you're dying in LA, when you're dying in LA
The power, the power, the power
Oh, the power, the power, the power
Of LA

[Verse 2]
Nights at the chateau, trapped in your sunset bungalow
You couldn't escape it, yeah
Drink of paradise, they told you to put your blood on ice
You're not gonna make it

[Pre-Chorus]
Every face along the boulevard
Is a dreamer just like you
You looked at death in a tarot card
And you saw what you had to do

[Chorus]
But nobody knows you now, when you're dying in LA
And nobody owes you now, when you're dying in LA
When you're dying in LA, when you're dying in LA
The power, the power, the power
Oh, the power, the power, the power
Of LA[Click here to read about the movie that inspired "Lying Is The Most Fun A Girl Can Have Without Taking Her Clothes Off"]

[Verse 1]
Is it still me that makes you sweat?
Am I who you think about in bed
When the lights are dim and your hands are shaking
As you're sliding off your dress?
Then think of what you did
And how I hope to God he was worth it
When the lights are dim and your heart is racing
As your fingers touch his skin

[Bridge]
I've got more wit, a better kiss, a hotter touch, a better fuck
Than any boy you'll ever meet, sweetie, you had me
Girl I was it, look past the sweat, a better love deserving of
Exchanging body heat in the passenger seat
No, no, no, you know it will always just be me

[Pre-Chorus]
Let's get these teen hearts beating faster, faster

[Chorus]
So testosterone boys and harlequin girls
Will you dance to this beat and hold a lover close?
So testosterone boys and harlequin girls
Will you dance to this beat and hold a lover close?

[Post-Chorus]
So, I guess we're back to us
Oh cameraman, swing the focus
In case I lost my train of thought
Where was it that we last left off? 

[Verse 2]
Oh, now I do recall
We were just getting to the part
Where the shock sets in
And the stomach acid finds a new way to make you get sick
I hope you didn't expect
To get all of the attention
Now, let's not get selfish
Did you really think I'd let you kill this chorus?

[Pre-Chorus]
Let's get these teen hearts beating faster, faster

Climbing out the back door, didn't leave a mark
No one knows it's you, Miss Jackson
Found another victim
But no one's going to find Miss Jackson

[Verse 1: Brendon Urie]
You put a sour little flavor in my mouth now
You move in circles hoping no one's gonna find out
But we're so lucky, kiss the ring and let them bow down
Looking for the time of your life 
A pretty picture but the scenery is so loud
A face like Heaven, catching lightning in your nightgown
But back away from the water, babe, you might drown
The party isn't over tonight 

[Pre-Chorus: Brendon Urie]
Hey, where will you be waking up tomorrow morning?
Hey, out the back door, goddamn, but I love her anyway
I love her anyway, I love her anyway
Out the back door, goddamn, but I love her anyway

Way down until the fire finally dies out
You've got them wrapped around your finger, watch them fall down
There's something beautiful and tragic in the fall out
Let me say it one more time

Hey, out the back door, goddamn, but I love her anyway
I love her anyway, I love her anyway

Everything is cherries on top
No wings of wax or endless mountains
Tragedies with penniless fountains
It's just cherries, cherries
It's coming up cherries on top
Sunset shadows through the trophies
I guess it just ain't big enough
Say it one more, one more, one more

[Chorus]
Fuck a silver lining
Fuck a silver lining
'Cause only gold is hot enough, hot enough
Fuck a silver lining
Fuck a silver lining
'Cause only gold is hot enough, hot enough

[Post-Chorus]
It's just cherries, cherries
Everything is cherries on top
It's just cherries, cherries
Everything is cherries on top
One more, one more

[Verse 2]
We've been falling, falling
It's like we fell to the top
I was born to cut a million
Cut my teeth and made a killing
Now I'm dodging, dodging
Everything you think that I'm not
Archetype of television
Was lost in thought but held the vision, hey

[Bridge]
When you gonna say my name?
When you gonna say my name?
Quick charade, Beyonc, Lemonade
When you gonna say my name?
When you gonna say my name?
No delay, no halfway, let me hear you say
One more, one more, one more

[Chorus]
Silver lining
Fuck a silver lining
'Cause only gold is hot enough, hot enough
Fuck a silver lining
Fuck a silver lining
'Cause only gold is hot enough, hot enough

[Post-Chorus]
It's just cherries, cherries
Everything is cherries on top
It's just cherries, cherries
Everything is cherries on top

[Outro]
Silver lining
Fuck a silver lining

Kids, you have to remember I'm up here conducting you for a reason, okay? Watch me, watch my fingers. Here we go, ready? Watch me. One and, two and, three and, ready, go!

[Intro]
Ds le premier jour, ton parfum enivra mon amour
Et dans ces instants, j'aimerais tre comme toi par moments
Mais depuis ce jour, je n'ai qu'un seul et unique regret...

[Verse 1]
My wing tips waltz across naive wood floors
They creak innocently down the stairs
Drag melody, my percussive
Feet serve cobweb headaches as a

[Pre-Chorus]
Matching set of marching clocks, the slumbering apparitions
That they've come to wake up

[Verse 2]
Here I am composing a burlesque out of where they rest their
Necks sunken in their splintered cradles
And ramshackle heads, they asked for it
As a girl

[Pre-Chorus]
You have set your heart on haunting me forever from the start
It's never silent

[Chorus]
Ever since we met, I only shoot up with your perfume
It's the only thing that makes me feel as good as you do
Ever since we met, I've got just one regret to live through
And that one regret is you

[Bridge]
How does a heart love if no one has noticed
Its presence, and where does it go?
Trembling hands play my heart like a drum
But the beat's gotten lost in the show

[Pre-Chorus]
You have set your heart on haunting me forever from the start
It's never silent

[Chorus]
Ever since we met, I only shoot up with your perfume
It's the only thing that makes me feel as good as you do
Ever since we met, I've got just one regret to live through
And I regret never letting you go!
Ever since we met, I only shoot up with your perfume
It's the only thing that makes me feel as good as you do
Ever since we met, I've got just one regret to live through
And that one regret is you!

[Outro]
Mona Lisa, pleased to please ya... 
Mona Lisa, pleased to please ya... 
Mona Lisa, pleased to please ya... 
Ahhh...

[Verse 1]
It's the substandard motels on the la-la-la-la-la
Corner of 4th and Fremont Street
Appealing only 'cause they're just that unappealing
Any practiced Catholic would cross themselves upon entering
The rooms have a hint of asbestos and maybe
Just a dash of formaldehyde
And a habit of decomposing
Right before your very la-la-la-la eyes

[Chorus]
Along with the people inside, what a wonderful
Caricature of intimacy
Inside, what a wonderful
Caricature of intimacy

[Verse 2]
Tonight's tenants range from a lawyer and a virgin
Accessorizing with a rosary tucked inside her lingerie
She's getting a job at the firm come Monday
The Mrs. will stay with the cheating attorney
Moonlighting aside, she really needs his money
Oh, wonderful caricature of intimacy
Yeah, yeah
And not to mention the
Constable and his
Proposition for that virgin
Yes, the one the lawyer met with
On strictly business, as he said to the Mrs
Well, only hours before, after he had left
She was fixing her face in a compact
There was a terrible crash
There was a terrible crash
Between her and the badge
She spilled her purse and her bag
And held a purse of
A different kind

[Chorus]
Along with the people inside, what a wonderful
Caricature of intimacy
Inside, what a wonderful
Caricature of intimacy

[Bridge]
There are no... raindrops on roses and girls in white dresses
It's sleeping with roaches and taking best guesses
At the shade of the sheets and before all the stains
And a few more of your least favorite things
Raindrops on roses and girls in white dresses
It's sleeping with roaches and taking best guesses
At the shade of the sheets and before all the stains
And a few more of your least favorite things

[Chorus]
Inside, what a wonderful
Caricature of intimacy
Inside, what a wonderful
Caricature of intimacy

[Outro]
Raindrops on roses and girls in white dresses
It's sleeping with roaches and taking best guesses
At the shade of the sheets and before all the stains
And a few more of your least favorite things
Raindrops on roses and the girls in white dresses
And the sleeping with the roaches and the taking best guesses
At the shade of the sheets and before all the stains
And a few more of your least favorite things

[Intro]
Ohh!
A moment you'll never remember
And a night you'll never forget!
Ohh!

[Chorus]
All you sinners stand up, sing hallelujah 
Show praise with your body
Stand up, sing hallelujah 
And if you can't stop shaking, lean back
Let it move right through ya 
Say your prayers
Say your prayers
Say your prayers


[Verse 1]
My life started the day I got caught
Under the covers
With secondhand lovers
Oh, tied up in pretty young things
In a state of emergency
Who was I trying to be

[Pre-Chorus]
Then the time for being sad is over
And you miss them like you miss no other
And being blue is better than being over it 

[Chorus]
All you sinners stand up, sing hallelujah 
Show praise with your body
Stand up, sing hallelujah 
And if you can't stop shaking, lean back
Let it move right through ya 
Say your prayers
Say your prayers
Say your prayers


[Verse 2]
I was drunk and it didnt mean a thing
Stop thinking about
The bullets from my mouth
I love the things you hate about yourself
Just finished a daydream
Who were you trying to be?

[Pre-Chorus]
Then the time for being sad is over
And you miss them like you miss no other
And being blue is better than being over it 

[Bridge]
No one wants you when you have no heart and
Im sitting pretty in my brand new scars and
Youll never know if you dont ever try again
So lets try
Lets try
Lets try


[Chorus]
All you sinners stand up, sing hallelujah 
Show praise with your body
Stand up, sing hallelujah 
And if you can't stop shaking, lean back
Let it move right through ya 
Say your prayers
Say your prayers
Say your prayers


[Chorus]
All you sinners stand up, sing hallelujah 
Show praise with your body
Stand up, sing hallelujah 
And if you can't stop shaking, lean back
Let it move right through ya 
Say your prayers
Say your prayers
Say your prayers

[Verse 1]
She paints her fingers with a close precision
He starts to notice empty bottles of gin
And takes a moment to assess the sin she's paid for
A lonely speaker in a conversation
Her words are swimming through his ears again
There's nothing wrong with just a taste of what you paid for

[Pre-Chorus]
Say what you mean, tell me I'm right
And let the sun rain down on me
Give me a sign, I wanna believe

[Chorus]
Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh, Mona Lisa
You're guaranteed to run this town
Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh, Mona Lisa
I'd pay to see you frown

[Verse 2]
He senses something, call it desperation
Another dollar, another day
And if she had the proper words to say, she would tell him
But she'd have nothing left to sell him

[Pre-Chorus]
Say what you mean, tell me I'm right
And let the sun rain down on me
Give me a sign, I wanna believe

[Chorus]
Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh, Mona Lisa
You're guaranteed to run this town
Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh, Mona Lisa
I'd pay to see you frown

Mona Lisa, wear me out
I'm pleased to please ya
Mona Lisa, wear me out

[Pre-Chorus]
Say what you mean, tell me I'm right
And let the sun rain down on me
Give me a sign, I wanna believe

[Chorus]
Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh, Mona Lisa
You're guaranteed to run this town
Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh, Mona Lisa
I'd pay to see you frown

Say what you mean, tell me I'm right
And let the sun rain down on me
Give me a sign, I wanna believe

[Outro]
There's nothing wrong with just a taste of what you paid for

[Verse 1]
If all our life is but a dream, fantastic posing greed
Then we should feed our jewelry to the sea
For diamonds do appear to be
Just like broken glass to me
And then she said she can't believe, genius only
Comes along in storms of fabled foreign tongues
Tripping eyes and flooded lungs
Northern downpour sends its love

[Chorus]
Hey moon, please forget to fall down
Hey moon, dont you go down
Sugarcane in the easy morning
Weathervanes my one and lonely

[Verse 2]
The ink is running toward the page, its chasing off the days
Look back at boat feet and that winding knee
I missed your skin when you were east
You clicked your heels and wished for me
Through playful lips made of yarn, that fragile Capricorn
Unraveled words like moths upon old scarves
I know the worlds a broken bone
But melt your headaches, call it home

[Chorus]
Hey moon, please forget to fall down
Hey moon, dont you go down
Sugarcane in the easy morning
Weathervanes my one and lonely

[Post-Chorus]
Sugarcane in the easy morning
Weathervanes my one and lonely
Sugarcane in the easy morning
Weathervanes my one and lonely
Sugarcane in the easy morning 
Weathervanes my one and lonely 
Sugarcane in the easy morning 
Weathervanes my one and lonely 

[Bridge]
Sugarcane in the easy morning

Weathervanes my one and lonely

Sugarcane in the easy morning

Weathervanes my one and lonely


[Outro]

Hey moon, please forget to fall down

Hey moon, don't you go down
You are at the top of my lungs
Drawn to the ones who never yawn

[Intro]
You can set yourself on fire, hey!
You can set yourself on fire, hey!

[Verse 1]
She said, "At night, in my dreams
You dance on a tightrope of weird
Oh, but when I wake up
You're so normal that you just disappear
You're so straight like commuters
With briefcases towing the line
There's no residue of a torturer
Inside of your eyes"

[Pre-Chorus]
She said, "You're just like Mike Love
But you wanna be Brian Wilson, Brian Wilson"
Said, "You're just like Mike Love
But you'll never be Brian Wilson"

[Chorus]
And I said
 If crazy equals genius
 If crazy equals genius
Then I'm a fucking arsonist 
I'm a rocket scientist 
 If crazy equals genius...

[Post-Chorus]
You can set yourself on fire 
But you're never gonna burn, burn, burn 
You can set yourself on fire 
But you're never gonna learn, learn, learn


[Verse 2]
She said, "Darlin', you know
How the wine plays tricks on my tongue
But you don't seem to change
When you stuff all of your feelings with drugs"
Other boys you may have dated
Serrated your heart with a slice
But the cut of your love never hurts
Baby, it's a sweet butter knife

[Pre-Chorus]
She said, "You're just like Mike Love
But you wanna be Brian Wilson, Brian Wilson"
Said, "You're just like Mike Love
But you'll never be Dennis Wilson"

[Chorus]
And I said
 If crazy equals genius
 If crazy equals genius
Then I'm a fucking arsonist 
I'm a rocket scientist 
 If crazy equals genius...

[Post-Chorus]
You can set yourself on fire 
But you're never gonna burn, burn, burn 
You can set yourself on fire 
But you're never gonna learn, learn, learn


[Bridge]
You can set yourself on fire 
You can set yourself on fire 
You can set yourself on fire 
You can set yourself on fire

[Chorus]
And I said
 If crazy equals genius
 If crazy equals genius
Then I'm a fucking arsonist 
I'm a rocket scientist 
 If crazy equals genius...

[Post-Chorus]
You can set yourself on fire 
But you're never gonna burn, burn, burn 
You can set yourself on fire 
But you're never gonna learn, learn, learn
[Verse 1]
Back to the street where we began
Feeling as good as lovers can, you know
Yeah, we're feeling so good
Picking up things we shouldn't read
It looks like the end of history as we know
Its just the end of the world
Back to the street where we began
Feeling as good as love, you could, you can

[Pre-Chorus]
Into a place where thoughts can bloom
Into a room where it's nine in the afternoon
And we know that it could be
And we know that it should
And you know that you feel it too

[Chorus]
'Cause it's nine in the afternoon
And your eyes are the size of the moon
You could 'cause you can, so you do
We're feeling so good just the way that we do
When it's nine in the afternoon
Your eyes are the size of the moon
You're good 'cause you can, so you do
We're feeling so good

[Verse 2]
Back to the street, down to our feet
Losing the feeling of feeling unique
Do you know what I mean?
Back to the place where we used to say
"Man, it feels good to feel this way"
Now I know what I mean

[Bridge]
Back to the street, back to the place
Back to the room where it all began, hey
Back to the room where it all began

[Chorus]
'Cause it's nine in the afternoon
Your eyes are the size of the moon
You could 'cause you can, so you do
We're feeling so good just the way that we do
When it's nine in the afternoon
Your eyes are the size of the moon
You could 'cause you can, so you do
We're feeling so good just the way that we do
When it's nine in the afternoon
Your eyes are the size of the moon
You could 'cause you can, so you do
We're feeling so good just the way that we do
When it's nine in the afternoon

[Intro]
Whoa, oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh

[Verse 1]
If you're a lover, you should know the lonely moments just get lonelier
The longer you're in love than if you were alone
Memories turn into daydreams, become a taboo

I don't want to be afraid, the deeper that I go
It takes my breath away, soft hearts, electric souls
Heart to heart and eyes to eyes, is this taboo?

[Chorus]
Baby, we built this house on memories
Take my picture now, shake it till you see it
And when your fantasies become your legacy
Promise me a place, in your house of memories

[Post-Chorus]
Whoa, oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh


[Verse 2]
I think of you from time to time more than I thought I would
You were just too kind and I was too young to know
That's all that really matters, I was a fool

[Chorus]
Baby, we built this house on memories
Take my picture now, shake it til you see it
And when your fantasies become your legacy
Promise me a place in your house of memories

[Post-Chorus]
Whoa, oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh

[Bridge]
Those thoughts of past lovers
They'll always haunt me
I wish I could believe
You'd never wrong me
Then will you remember
Me in the same way as I remember you

[Chorus]
Baby, we built this house on memories
Take my picture now, shake it til you see it
And when your fantasies become your legacy
Promise me a place
Baby, we built this house on memories
Take my picture now, shake it til you see it
And when your fantasies become your legacy
Promise me a place in your house of memories

[Outro]
(Whoa, oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh)
In your house of memories
(Whoa, oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh)
Promise me a place

Baptize, don't worry 'bout tomorrow

Every weekend with your friends, every weekday when it ends
Damn it's all good, I guess

This is what it feels like when you become one of the drunks

Wet the whistle, wet the whistle, abyss of ice crystals

Yeah, there's a couple fracks, but we got it. That's the shit, that's the shit, and, man, I saw you fuckin' lift that sax up towards the microphone and I fell in love!
K, alright, one more time, here we go

[Verse 1]
Now I'm of consenting age
To be forgetting you in a cabaret
Somewhere downtown where a burlesque queen
May even ask my name
As she sheds her skin on stage
I'm seated and sweating to a dance song on the club's PA
The strip joint veteran sits two away
Smirking between dignified sips of his dignified
Peach and lime daiquiri

[Chorus]
And isn't this exactly where you'd like me?
I'm exactly where you'd like me, you know
Praying for love in a lap dance
And paying in naivety?
Oh, isn't this exactly where you'd like me?
I'm exactly where you'd like me, you know
Praying for love in a lap dance
And paying in naivety?

[Post-Chorus]
Oh, but I'm afraid that I, well, I may have faked it
And I wouldn't be caught dead, d-dead, d-dead, d-dead in this place
Well, I'm afraid that I, well, that's right, well, I may have faked it
And I wouldn't be caught dead in this place

And isn't this exactly where you'd like me?
I'm exactly where you'd like me, you know

Sit tight, I'm going to need you to keep time
Come on, just snap, snap, snap your fingers for me
Good, good, now we're making some progress
Come on, just tap, tap, tap your toes to the beat

[Pre-Chorus]
And I believe this may call for a proper introduction, and well
Don't you see? I'm the narrator, and this is just the prologue

[Chorus]
Swear to shake it up, if you swear to listen
Oh, we're still so young, desperate for attention
I aim to be your eyes, trophy boys, trophy wives
Swear to shake it up, if you swear to listen
Oh, we're still so young, desperate for attention
I aim to be your eyes, trophy boys, trophy wives

Applause, applause, no, wait, wait
Dear studio audience, I've an announcement to make
It seems the artists these days are not who you think
So we'll pick back up on that on another page

And I believe this may call for a proper introduction, and well
Don't you see, I'm the narrator and this is just the prologue

I found a pile of Polaroids in the crates of a record shop
They were sexy, sexy looking back from a night that time forgot
 Boy, he was something, debonair in 1979
And she had Farrah Fawcett hair, carafes of blood red wine

[Pre-Chorus]
In the summertime, in the summertime

[Chorus]
Oh, don't you wonder when the light begins to fade?
And the clock just makes the colors turn to grey
Forever younger, growing older just the same
All the memories that we make will never change
We'll stay drunk, we'll stay tan, let the love remain
And I swear that I'll always paint you

[Post-Chorus]
Golden days, golden days, golden days, golden days

[Verse 2]
I bet they met some diplomats on Bianca Jagger's new yacht
With their caviar and dead cigars, the air was sauna hot
I bet they never even thought about the glitter dancing on the skin
The decades might've washed it out as the flashes popped like pins

[Pre-Chorus]
In the summertime, in the summertime

[Chorus]
Oh, don't you wonder when the light begins to fade?
And the clock just makes the colors turn to grey
Forever younger, growing older just the same
All the memories that we make will never change
We'll stay drunk, we'll stay tan, let the love remain
And I swear that I'll always paint you

[Post-Chorus]
Golden days, golden days, golden days, golden days

[Bridge]
Time can never break your heart, but it'll take the pain away
Right now our future's certain, I won't let it fade away

Golden days, golden days, golden days, golden days
Golden days, golden days, golden days, golden days

Please leave all overcoats, canes, and top hats with the doorman
From that moment, you'll be out of place and under-dressed
I'm wrecking this evening already, and loving every minute of it
Ruining this banquet for the mildly inspiring, and...
Please leave all overcoats, canes, and top hats with the doorman

When you're in black slacks with accentuating, off-white
Pinstripes, whoa, everything goes according to plan

[Chorus]
I'm the new cancer, never looked better
You can't stand it
Because you say so under your breath
You're reading lips, "When did he get all confident?"
Haven't you heard that
I'm the new cancer?
Never looked better and
You can't stand it

[Verse 2]
Next is a trip to the, the ladies' room in vain, and
I bet you just can't keep up with  with these fashionistas
And tonight, tonight, you are, you are a whispering campaign
I bet to them your name is cheap, I bet to them you look like sh...
Talk to the mirror, oh, choke back tears
And keep telling yourself that "I'm a diva!"
Oh, and the smokes in that cigarette box on the table
They just so happen to be laced with nitroglycerin

[Chorus]
I'm the new cancer, never looked better
You can't stand it
Because you say so under your breath
You're reading lips, "When did he get all confident?"
Haven't you heard that
I'm the new cancer?
Never looked better and
You can't stand it

Haven't you heard that I'm the new cancer?
I've never looked better and you can't stand it

I've never looked better and you can't stand it

[Outro]
And I know, and I know it just doesn't feel like
A night out, with no one sizing you up
I've never been so surreptitious, so of course
You'll be distracted when I spike the punch
And I know, and I know it just doesn't feel like
A night out, with no one sizing you up
I've never been so surreptitious, so of course
You'll be distracted when I spike the punch
And I know, and I know it just doesn't feel like
A night out, with no one sizing you up
I've never been so surreptitious, so of course
You'll be distracted when I spike the punch!

[Verse 1]
Once upon a thrill, from a kiss to a swill
We were swallowin' the nights like we had nine lives
Dead and gone so long, seventeen so gone
Dead and gone so long, seventeen so
We were borderline kids with a book of disorders
Medicatin' every day to keep the straightness in order
Dead and gone so long, seventeen so gone
Dead and gone so long, seventeen so gone

[Pre-Chorus]
It's the false side of hope where believers concede
And there's only memories when it's over

[Chorus]
So pour out some liquor, make it an old-fashioned
Remember your youth, in all that you do
The plank and the passion
They were the best of times, they were the best of times
They were the best of times, they were the best of times
Of your life

[Verse 2]
Once upon before, we were brilliant and bored
Two dashes of the bitters, add some ice and you pour
Dead and gone so long, seventeen so gone
Dead and gone so long, seventeen so gone

[Pre-Chorus]
It's the false side of hope where believers concede
And there's only memories when it's over

[Chorus]
So pour out some liquor, make it an old-fashioned
Remember your youth, in all that you do
The plank and the passion
They were the best of times, they were the best of times
They were the best of times, they were the best of times
Of your life

[Bridge]
Get boozy, boozy, boozy 
Get boozy, boozy, boozy 
Get boozy, boozy, boozy 
Get boozy, boozy, boozy 
Get boozy, boozy, boozy, Get boozy, boozy, boozy
Get boozy, boozy, boozy, Get boo-

[Chorus]
So pour out some liquor, make it an old-fashioned
Remember your youth, in all that you do
The plank and the passion
They were the best of times, they were the best of times
They were the best of times, they were the best of times

[Intro]


[Verse 1]
Cross my heart and hope to die
Burn my lungs and curse my eyes
I've lost control and I don't want it back
I'm going numb, I've been hijacked
It's a fucking drag

[Chorus]
I taste you on my lips and I can't get rid of you
So I say damn your kiss and the awful things you do
Yeah, you're worse than nicotine, nicotine
Yeah, you're worse than nicotine, nicotine
Yeah

[Verse 2]
It's better to burn than to fade away
It's better to leave than to be replaced
I'm losing to you, baby, I'm no match
I'm going numb, I've been hijacked
It's a fucking drag

[Chorus]
I taste you on my lips and I can't get rid of you
So I say damn your kiss and the awful things you do
Yeah, you're worse than nicotine, nicotine
Yeah, you're worse than nicotine, nicotine
Yeah

[Bridge]
Just one more hit and then we're through
'Cause you could never love me back
Cut every tie I have to you
'Cause your love's a fucking drag
But I need it so bad
Your love's a fucking drag
But I need it so bad

[Chorus]
Yeah, you're worse than nicotine, nicotine
Yeah, you're worse than nicotine, nicotine
Yeah

[Intro]
The I.V. and your hospital bed
This was no accident, this was a therapeutic chain of events

[Verse 1]
This is the scent of dead skin on a linoleum floor
This is the scent of quarantine wings in a hospital
It's not so pleasant and it's not so conventional
It sure as hell ain't normal but we deal, we deal
The anesthetic never set in and I'm wondering where
The apathy and urgency is that I thought I phoned in
It's not so pleasant and it's not so conventional
And it sure as hell ain't normal but we deal, we deal

[Pre-Chorus]
Just sit back, just sit back
Just sit back and relax
Just sit back, just sit back
Just sit back and relapse again

[Chorus]
Can't take the kid from the fight, take the fight from the kid
Sit back, relax, sit back, relapse again
Can't take the kid from the fight, take the fight from the kid
Just sit back, just sit back

[Post-Chorus 1]
You're a regular decorated emergency
You're a regular decorated emergency

[Verse 2]
This is the scent of dead skin on a linoleum floor
This is the scent of quarantine wings in a hospital
It's not so pleasant and it's not so conventional
It sure as hell ain't normal but we deal, we deal
The anesthetic never set in and Im wondering where
The apathy and urgency is that I thought I phoned in
Its not so pleasant and it's not so conventional
It sure as hell ain't normal but we deal, we deal

[Chorus]
Can't take the kid from the fight, take the fight from the kid
Sit back, relax, sit back, relapse again
Can't take the kid from the fight, take the fight from the kid
Just sit back, just sit back

[Post-Chorus 2]
Sit back, sit back, relax, relapse
Sit back, sit back, ba-ba, ba-da-do
You can't take the kid out of the fight...

[Bridge]
You're a regular decorated emergency
The bruises and contusions
Will remind me what you did when you wake
You've earned your place atop the ICU's hall of fame
The camera caught you causing a commotion on the gurney again
You're a regular decorated emergency
The bruises and contusions
Will remind me what you did when you wake
You've earned your place atop the ICU's hall of fame
The camera caught you causing a commotion on the gurney again

[Chorus]
Can't take the kid from the fight, take the fight from the kid
Sit back, relax, sit back, relapse again
Can't take the kid from the fight, take the fight from the kid
Just sit back, just sit back

[Post-Chorus 2]
Sit back, sit back, relax, relapse
Sit back, sit back, ba-ba, ba-da-do
You can take the kid out of the fight...

[Outro]
The I.V. and your hospital bed
This was no accident, this was a therapeutic chain of events

[Intro]
Ah-ah, oh-oh
Ah-ah, oh-oh, oh-oh
Into the unknown
Into the unknown
Into the unknown
Ah-ah, oh-oh

[Verse 1]
I can hear you butIwon't
Some look fortrouble
While others don't
There's a thousand reasons
Ishould go about my day
And ignore your whispers
Which I wish would go away, oh-oh-oh
Whoa-oh

[Verse 2]
You're not a voice
You're just a ringing in my ear
And if I heard you, which I don't
I'm spoken for, I fear
Everyone I've ever loved is here within these walls
I'm sorry, secret siren, but I'm blocking out your calls
I've had my adventure, I don't need something new
I'm afraid of what I'm risking if I follow you

[Chorus]
Into the unknown
Into the unknown
Into the unknown

[Post-Chorus]
Ah-ah, oh-oh
Ah-ah, oh-oh, oh-oh

[Verse 3]
What do you want? 'Cause you've been keeping me awake
Are you here to distract me so I make a big mistake?
Or are you someone out there who's a little bit like me?
Who knows deep down I'm not where I'm meant to be?
Every day's a little harder as I feel your power grow
Don't you know there's part of me that longs to go

[Chorus]
Into the unknown?
Into the unknown
Into the unknown

[Post-Chorus]
Ah-ah, oh-oh
Ah-ah, oh-oh, oh-oh 

[Bridge]
Are you out there?
Do you know me?
Can you feel me?
Can you show me?
Ah-ah, oh-oh
Ah-ah, oh-oh
Ah-ah, oh-oh 
Oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh

[Outro]
Where are you going?
Don't leave me alone
How do I follow you
Into the unknown?
Woo!

[Intro]
Let me hear you say somethin'

[Verse 1]
Sorry to get sentimental tonight

It's just that everything reminds me of things
I thought I shouldn't have to see again
See, the thing is I'm so sorry to say

Someone still loves you 
Someone still loves you

[Chorus]
Meet me, meet me
At the overpass, at the overpass
Sketchy girls and lipstick boys

Troubled love and high speed noise
I know you wanna meet me, meet me
At the overpass, at the overpass
Sketchy girls and lipstick boys

Troubled love and high speed noise
I know you wanna
Let me hear you say somethin'

[Verse 2]
I have a shirt that keeps your smell

You keep one too in parallel

See the thing is I'm so sorry to say

Someone still loves you 
Someone still loves you

[Bridge]
Tiny bottles of shit wine
In a tin can that climbs
But I remember every time
Everything about you is perfect
Down to your blood type
But I remember every time

[Chorus]
Meet me, meet me
At the overpass, at the overpass
Sketchy girls and lipstick boys

Troubled love and high speed noise
I know you wanna meet me, meet me
At the overpass, at the overpass
Sketchy girls and lipstick boys

Troubled love and high speed noise
I know you wanna
Let me hear you say somethin'

[Verse 1]
Well, she's not bleeding on the ballroom floor
Just for the attention, 'cause that's just ridiculously odd
Well, she sure is gonna get it, here's the setting, fashion magazines
Line the walls, now, the walls line the bullet holes

[Chorus]
Have some composure, where is your posture? 
You're pulling the trigger, pulling the trigger 
Have some composure, where is your posture? 
You're pulling the trigger, pulling the trigger 

[Post-Chorus]
Give me envy, give me malice, give me your attention
Give me envy, give me malice, baby, give me a break!
When I say "Shotgun," you say "Wedding"
Shotgun wedding! Shotgun wedding!

[Verse 2]
She didn't choose this role, but she'll play it and make it sincere so
You cry, you cry , but they believe it from the
Tears and the teeth, right down to the blood at her feet
Boys will be boys, hiding in estrogen, and wearing Aubergine
Dreams 

[Chorus]
Have some composure, where is your posture? 
You're pulling the trigger, pulling the trigger 
Have some composure, where is your posture? 
You're pulling the trigger, pulling the trigger 

[Bridge]
Come on, this is screaming "photo op," come on, come on
This is screaming, this is screaming, this is screaming "photo op"
Boys will be boys, baby, boys will be boys
Boys will be boys, baby, boys will be boys

[Post-Chorus]
Give me envy, give me malice, give me your attention
Give me envy, give me malice, baby, give me a break!
When I say "Shotgun," you say "Wedding"
Shotgun wedding! Shotgun wedding!

[Outro]
Boys will be boys, hiding in estrogen
And boys will be boys
Boys will be boys, hiding in estrogen
And wearing Aubergine Dreams

[Verse 1]
There's no sunshine, this impossible year
Only black days and sky grey and clouds full of fear
And storms full of sorrow that won't disappear
Just typhoons and monsoons, this impossible year

[Verse 2]
There's no good times, this impossible year
Just a beachfront of bad blood and a coast that's unclear
All the guests at the party, they're so insincere
They just intrude and exclude, this impossible year

[Verse 3]
There's no you and me, this impossible year
Only heartache and heartbreak and gin made of tears
The bitter pill I swallow,  the scar's souvenir
That tattoo, your last bruise, this impossible year

[Bridge]
There's never air to breathe, there's never in-betweens
These nightmares always hang on past the dream...

[Outro]
There's no sunshine...
There's no you and me...
There's no good times...
This impossible year...

[Verse 1]
I feel the salty waves come in
I feel them crash against my skin
And I smile as I respire because I know they'll never win
There's a haze above my TV
That changes everything I see
And maybe if I continue watching
I'll lose the traits that worry me

[Pre-Chorus]
Can we fast-forward to go down on me?

[Chorus]
Stop there and let me correct it
I want to live a life from a new perspective
You come along because I love your face
And I'll admire your expensive taste
And who cares? Divine intervention
I want to be praised from a new perspective
But leaving now would be a good idea
So catch me up on getting out of here

[Post-Chorus]
Can we fast-forward til you go down on me?

[Verse 2]
Taking everything for granted
But we still respect the time
We move along with some new passion
Knowing everything is fine 
And I would wait and watch the hours fall
In a hundred separate lines
But I regain repose and wonder how I ended up inside

[Pre-Chorus]
Can we fast-forward til you go down on me?

[Chorus]
Stop there and let me correct it
I want to live a life from a new perspective
You come along because I love your face
And I'll admire your expensive taste
And who cares? Divine intervention
I want to be praised from a new perspective
But leaving now would be a good idea
So catch me up on getting out of here
Catch me up on getting out of here

[Bridge]
More to the point, I need to show
How much I can come and go
Other plans fell through
And put a heavy load on you
I know there's no more that need be said
When I'm inching through your bed
Take a look around instead and watch me go

[Chorus]
Stop there and let me correct it
I want to live a life from a new perspective
You come along because I love your face
And I'll admire your expensive taste
And who cares? Divine intervention
I want to be praised from a new perspective
But leaving now would be a good idea
So catch me up on getting out of here
It's not fair, just let me perfect it
Don't want to live a life that is comprehensive
'Cause seeing clear would be a bad idea
Now catch me up on getting out of here
So catch me up, I'm getting out of here

[Outro]
G-g-go down on me
Can we fast-forward til you go d-d-d-d-down?

[Intro]
Oh, whoa whoa oh oh, whoa oh oh, the good, the bad, and the dirty
Oh, whoa, whoa oh oh, whoa oh oh, the good, the bad, and the dirty

[Verse 1]
Truth is that it was always going to end
The symphony buzzing in my head
Took a market of filth and sold like summer
True, all of the good girls act so good
'Til one of them doesn't wait their turn
Turn the memory to stone and carve your shoulder
Hey, holy roller

[Chorus]
If you wanna start a fight
You better throw the first punch
Make it a good one
And if ya wanna make it through the night
You better say my name like
The good, the bad, and the dirty

[Post-Chorus]
Oh, the good, the bad, and the dirty
Oh, the good, the bad, and the dirty

[Verse 2]
I know what it's like to have to trade
The ones that you love for the ones you hate
Don't think I've ever used a day of my education
There's only two ways that these things can go
Good or bad and how was I to know
That all your friends won't hold any grudges
I got the final judgement

[Chorus]
If you wanna start a fight
You better throw the first punch
Make it a good one
And if ya wanna make it through the night
You better say my name like
The good, the bad, and the dirty

[Post-Chorus]
Oh, the good, the bad, and the dirty
Oh, the good, the bad, and the dirty

[Bridge]
And you been gone so long
I forgot what you feel like
But I'm not gonna think about that right now
I'm gonna keep getting underneath you
I'm gonna keep getting underneath you
And all our friends want us to fall in love

[Chorus]
If you wanna start a fight
You better throw the first punch
Make it a good one
And if ya wanna make it through the night
You better say my name like
The good, the bad, and the dirty

[Post-Chorus]
Oh, the good, the bad, and the dirty
Oh, the good, the bad, and the dirty

[Intro]
Let's do it
Let's do it
If you love me

[Verse 1]
I'm a moon-walker, I'm like MJ up in the clouds
I know it sounds awkward, I'm filthy as charged, filthy as charged
You're a sweet talker, but darlin' whatcha gonna say now?
The midnight marauders, the higher never come down, never come down

[Pre-Chorus]
You can't take me anywhere, anywhere
You can't take me anywhere, anywhere
I'm still uninvited, I'm still gonna light it, I'm going insane
And I don't care

Whatever they tell you...


[Chorus]
Dancin' , dancin' 
Dancin's not a crime, 'less you do it without me, 'less you do it without me

Oooh

Dancin's not a crime
Unless you do it , do it , do it do it do it without me 
 Without me


[Verse 2]
And if you're night crawlin' with him, I won't take it lying down
I've got a few lawyers and you're guilty as charged, guilty as charged
We could be waltzin', yeah
But darlin' don't be throwing shade now
Don't call me Saint California if you're at another altar
Just gimme your vows, gimme your vows, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
You can't take me anywhere, anywhere
You can't take me anywhere, anywhere
I'm still uninvited, I'm still gonna light it, I'm going insane
And I don't care

Whatever they tell you...


[Chorus]
Dancin' , dancin' 
Dancin's not a crime, 'less you do it without me, 'less you do it without me 
Dancin' , dancin'

Unless you do it , do it , do it do it do it without me 

Without me


[Bridge]
Ooo-ooo-ooo
What's come over you?
Baby, just tell me now
Ooo-ooo-ooo
Why did you make that move?
'Cause I just wanna be your boyfriend/girlfriend, oh yeah
And I just wanna be your boyfriend/girlfriend, oh yeah, oh yeah

Whatever they tell you...


[Chorus]
Dancin' , dancin' 
Dancin's not a crime, 'less you do it without me, 'less you do it without me 
Dancin' , dancin' 
Dancin's not a crime
Unless you do it , do it , do it do it do it without me 

[Outro]

Eh eh eh eh eh eh eh 
Eh eh eh eh eh eh eh 

[Verse 1: Lady Gaga]
I, I feel good, I walk alone
But then I trip upon myself and I fall
I, I stand up, and then I'm okay
But then you print some shit that makes me wanna scream

[Pre-Chorus: Lady Gaga]
So do what you want, what you want with my body
Do what you want, don't stop, let's party
Do what you want, what you want with my body

If you're wondering, know that I'm not sorry
Do what you want, what you want with my body
What you want with my body

[Chorus: Lady Gaga]
You can't have my heart, and you won't use my mind
But do what you want with my body

You cant stop my voice 'cause you don't own my life
But do what you want with my body
Do what you want with my body

[Verse 2: R. Kelly]
Early morning, longer nights 
Tom Ford, private flights 
Crazy schedule, fast life
I wouldn't trade it in, 'cause it's our life

I could be the drink in your cup
I could be the green in your blunt, your pusher man
Yeah, I got what you want
You wanna escape 
All of the crazy shit 
You're the Marilyn, I'm the president
And I love to hear you sing 

[Pre-Chorus 2: R. Kelly]
Do what I want, do what I want with your body
Do what I want, do what I want with your body
Back of the club, taking shots, gettin' naughty
No invitations, it's a private party
Do what I want, do what I want with your body
Do what I want, do what I want with your body
Yeah, we taking these haters and we roughin' 'em up
And we layin the cut like we don't give a fuck

[Chorus: Lady Gaga & R. Kelly]
You can't have my heart, and you won't use my mind 
But do what you want with my body 
Do what you want with my body 
You cant stop my voice 'cause you don't own my life
But do what you want with my body
Do what you want with my body 

[Bridge: Lady Gaga]
Sometimes I'm scared, I suppose
If you ever let me go
I would fall apart if you break my heart
So just take my body and don't stop the party

[Chorus: Lady Gaga & R. Kelly, Both]
You can't have my heart and 
You won't use my mind
But do what you want with my body
Do what you want with my body 
You cant stop my voice, 'cause
You don't own my life 
But do what you want with my body

Do what you want with my body

[Outro: Lady Gaga]
Do what you want with me

Do what you want with me
What you want with my body, world
Help me now

Do what you want with my body
Do what you want with my body
Want you want with my body, world

[Verse 1]
That Arizona sky
Burnin' in your eyes
You look at me and babe, I wanna catch on fire
Its buried in my soul
Like California gold
You found the light in me that I couldnt find

[Chorus]
So when I'm all choked up and I can't find the words
Every time we say goodbye, baby, it hurts
When the sun goes down
And the band won't play
I'll always remember us this way

[Verse 2]
Lovers in the night
Poets tryna write
We don't know how to rhyme, but damn, we try
But all I really know
You're where I wanna go
The part of me that's you will never die

[Chorus]
So when I'm all choked up and I can't find the words
Every time we say goodbye, baby, it hurts
When the sun goes down
And the band won't play
I'll always remember us this way

[Bridge]
Oh yeah
I don't wanna be just a memory, baby, yeah
Hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo
Hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo
Hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo hoo hooooooooo

[Chorus]
So when I'm all choked up and I can't find the words
Every time we say goodbye, baby, it hurts
When the sun goes down and the band won't play
I'll always remember us this way
Way yeah

[Outro]
When you look at me and the whole world fades
I'll always remember us this way

[Outro]
Oooh, oooh, hmmmm
Oooh, oooh, hmmmm

[Verse 1]

Our lovers' quarrel

Hurts more than I can say

All night

Help me here

Help me here

'Cause I can't help my mind from going there!

[Pre-Chorus]
Heard your boyfriend was away this weekend
Wanna meet at my place?
Heard that we both got nothing to do
When I lay in bed, I touch myself and think of you

[Chorus]
Last night
Damn, you were in my sex dreams 
Doing really nasty things 
Damn, you were in my sex dreams 
Making love in my sex dreams

[Verse 2]
We could be caught

We're both convicted criminals of thought

Let's white

Glove the bed

Help me here

'Cause we can't hide the evidence in our heads!

[Pre-Chorus]
Heard your boyfriend was away this weekend
Wanna meet at my place?
Heard that we both got nothing to do 
When I lay in bed, I touch myself and think of you

[Chorus]
Last night
Damn, you were in my sex dreams 
Doing really nasty things 
Damn, you were in my sex dreams 
Making love in my sex dreams

[Post-Chorus]
Don't stop the party 
Let's keep it naughty, yeah 
Watch me act a fool 
Tomorrow when I run into you, tomorrow when I run into you

[Bridge]
You could turn to stone
Or the color of men petrified by a woman
In love as I am when I lay with you
I think of him, I think of him

[Spoken Interlude]
I can't believe I'm telling you this, but I've had a couple drinks and...
Oh my God!

[Chorus]
Last night
Damn, you were in my sex dreams 
Doing really nasty things 
Damn, you were in my sex dreams 
Making love in my sex dreams

[Post-Chorus]
Don't stop the party 
Let's keep it naughty, yeah 
Watch me act a fool 
Tomorrow when I run into you 

[iTunes Festival Demo Bridge]
We were in the swimming pool
I was naked, boy, so were you
And we bumped this song while we made love
Dangerous poetry rhymed with our bodies
And now it's time for the trial with doubts and drawls
I can't believe I'm telling you this, but I've had a couple drinks and...
Oh my God!

[Verse 1]
Wish I could, I could've said goodbye
I would've said what I wanted to
Maybe even cried for you
If I knew, it would be the last time
I would've broke my heart in two
Tryin' to save a part of you

[Chorus]
Don't want to feel another touch
Don't wanna start another fire
Don't wanna know another kiss
No other name falling off my lips
Don't wanna to give my heart away
To another stranger
Or let another day begin
Won't even let the sunlight in
No, I'll never love again
I'll never love again
Ooouuu ooou oou

Oh

[Verse 2]
When we first met
I never thought that I would fall
I never thought that I'd find myself
Lying in your arms
And I want to pretend that it's not true
Oh baby, that you're gone
'Cause my world keeps turning, and turning, and turning
And I'm not movin' on

[Chorus]
Don't want to feel another touch
Don't wanna start another fire
Don't wanna know another kiss
No other name falling off my lips
Don't wanna give my heart away
To another stranger
Or let another day begin
Won't even let the sunlight in
No, I'll never love

[Bridge]
I don't wanna know this feeling
Unless it's you and me
I don't wanna waste a moment, ooh
And I don't wanna give somebody else the better part of me
I would rather wait for you
Hoooo ouuu

[Chorus]
Don't want to feel another touch
Don't want to start another fire
Don't want to know another kiss
Baby unless they are your lips
Don't want to give my heart away to another stranger
Or let another day begin
Won't even let the sunlight in
Oooo I'll never love again
Love again
I'll never love again
I'll never love
Again

[Outro]
I won't I won't I swear I can't
I wish I could but I just won't
I'll never love again
I'll never love
Again
Who oo oo oo oo
Hmmm

[Verse 1]
You're giving me a million reasons to let you go
You're giving me a million reasons to quit the show
You're givin' me a million reasons
Give me a million reasons
Givin' me a million reasons
About a million reasons

If I had a highway, I would run for the hills
If you could find a dry way, I'd forever be still
But you're giving me a million reasons
Give me a million reasons
Givin' me a million reasons
About a million reasons

[Chorus]
I bow down to pray
I try to make the worst seem better
Lord, show me the way
To cut through all his worn out leather
I've got a hundred million reasons to walk away
But baby, I just need one good one to stay

[Verse 2]
Head stuck in a cycle, I look off and I stare
It's like that I've stopped breathing, but completely aware
'Cause you're giving me a million reasons
Give me a million reasons
Givin' me a million reasons
About a million reasons

And if you say something that you might even mean
It's hard to even fathom which parts I should believe
'Cause you're giving me a million reasons
Give me a million reasons
Givin' me a million reasons
About a million reasons

[Chorus]
I bow down to pray
I try to make the worst seem better
Lord, show me the way
To cut through all his worn out leather
I've got a hundred million reasons to walk away
But baby, I just need one good one to stay

[Bridge]
Hey, ehh, ehh, eyy
Baby I'm bleedin', bleedin'
Stay, ehh, ehhy
Can't you give me what I'm needin', needin'
Every heartbreak makes it hard to keep the faith
But baby, I just need one good one
Good one, good one, good one, good one, good one

[Chorus]
When I bow down to pray
I try to make the worst seem better
Lord, show me the way
To cut through all his worn out leather
I've got a hundred million reasons to walk away
But baby, I just need one good one, good one
Tell me that you'll be the good one, good one
Baby, I just need one good one to stay

Greetings, Himeros

Lay back, and feast as this audio guides you through new and exciting positions

[Verse 1]
I wanna be the girl under you 
I wanna be your G.U.Y
Yeah, I wanna be the grave and earth you 
Our sex doesn't tell us no lies

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm gonna wear the tie, want the power to leave you
I'm aimin' for full control of this love 
Touch me, touch me, don't be sweet
Love me, love me, please retweet
Let me be the girl under you that makes you cry

[Chorus]
I wanna be that guy

Just put your paws up

[Verse 1]
My mama told me when I was young
"We are all born superstars"
She rolled my hair and put my lipstick on
In the glass of her boudoir
"There's nothing wrong with loving who you are"
She said, "'Cause he made you perfect, babe"
"So hold your head up, girl, and you'll go far, listen to me when I say"

Mi amore vole fe yah

Rejoice and love yourself today

Tryin' to get control
Pressure's takin' its toll
Stuck in the middle zone
I just want you alone
My guessing game is strong
Way too real to be wrong
Caught up in your show
Yeah, at least now I know

[Chorus]
It wasn't love, it wasn't love
It was a perfect illusion 
Mistaken for love, it wasn't love
It was a perfect illusion 
You were a perfect illusion

I don't need eyes to see
I felt you touchin' me
High like amphetamine
Maybe you're just a dream
That's what it means to crush
Now that I'm wakin' up
I still feel the blow
But at least now I know

It wasn't love, it wasn't love
It was a perfect illusion 
Mistaken for love, it wasn't love

It was a perfect illusion
But I feel you watchin' me
But I feel you watchin' me
Illusion
But I feel you watchin' me
Mistaken for love
Where were you
'Cause I can't see
But I feel you watchin' me
Mistaken for love
Dilated, falling free
In a modern ecstasy
Mistaken for love
In a modern ecstasy
In a modern ecstasy

I'm over the show
Yeah at least now I know

[Chorus]
It wasn't love, it wasn't love
It was a perfect illusion 
Mistaken for love, it wasn't love
It was a perfect illusion 
You were a perfect illusion
You were a perfect illusion
It was a perfect illusion
Somewhere in all the confusion
It was a perfect illusion, illusion 

[Outro]
Where were you 'cause I can't see it
It was perfect illusion
But I feel you watchin' me, baby
Somewhere in all the confusion
Dilated, fallin' free
You were so perfect

I'm not a wandering slave, I am a woman of choice
My veil is protection for the gorgeousness of my face
You ought to pity me 'cause was arranged one man to love
But in the bedroom, the size of him's more than enough

[Chorus]
Do you wanna see me naked, lover?
Do you wanna peek underneath the cover?
Do you wanna see the girl who lives behind the aura, behind the aura?
Do you wanna touch me, cosmic lover?
Do you wanna peek underneath the cover?
Do you wanna see the girl who lives behind the aura?
Behind the aura, behind the aura, behind the aura?

[Verse 2]
Enigma popstar is fun, she wear burqa for fashion
It's not a statement as much as just a move of passion
I may not walk on your street or shoot a gun on your soil
I hear you screaming, is it because of pleasure or toil?

Dance, sex, art, pop, tech
Dance, sex, art, pop, tech

Do you wanna see me naked, lover?
Do you wanna peek underneath the cover?

Hello, hello? Baby, you called, I can't hear a thing
I have got no service in the club, you say, say?
Wha-wha-what did you say, huh? You're breaking up on me
Sorry, I cannot hear you, I'm kind of busy
K-kind of busy, k-kind of busy
Sorry, I cannot hear you, I'm kind of busy

[Verse 2: Lady Gaga]
Just a second, it's my favorite song they're gonna play
And I cannot text you with a drink in my hand, eh
You should've made some plans with me, you knew that I was free
And now you won't stop calling me, I'm kind of busy

[Chorus: Lady Gaga]
Stop calling, stop calling, I don't wanna think anymore

Stop calling, stop calling, I don't wanna talk anymore

And you're not gonna reach my telephone
'Cause I'm out in the club and I'm sipping that bubb
And you're not gonna reach my telephone

[Verse 3: Beyonc]
Boy, the way you blowing up my phone won't make me leave no faster
Put my coat on faster, leave my girls no faster
I should've left my phone at home 'cause this is a disaster
Callin' like a collector, sorry, I cannot answer

[Verse 4: Lady Gaga & Beyonc, both]
It's not that I don't like you, I'm just at a party
And I am sick and tired of my phone r-ringing
Sometimes I feel like I live in Grand Central Station
Tonight, I'm not taking no calls 'cause I'll be dancing
'Cause I'll be dancing, 'cause I'll be dancing
Tonight I'm not taking no calls, 'cause I'll be dancing

[Chorus: Lady Gaga]
Stop calling, stop calling, I don't wanna think anymore
I left my head and my heart on the dance floor
Stop calling, stop calling, I don't wanna talk anymore
I left my head and my heart on the dance floor
Stop calling, stop calling, I don't wanna think anymore
I left my head and my heart on the dance floor
Stop calling, stop calling, I don't wanna talk anymore

'Cause I'm out in the club, and I'm sipping that bubb
And you're not gonna reach my telephone
We're sorry
The number you have reached is not in service at this time
Please check the number or try your call again

[Verse 1]
Sometimes a story has no end
Sometimes I think that we could just be friends
"'Cause I'm a wandering man," he said to me
"And what about the future plans?
Does this thing we have even makes sense?
When I got the whole world in front of me?"
So, I said...

[Chorus 1]
I don't wanna be alone forever, but I can be tonight
I don't wanna be alone forever, but I love gypsy life
I don't wanna be alone forever
Maybe we can see the world together
I don't wanna be alone forever, but I can be
Tonight!
Tonight!

[Verse 2]
So I just packed my baggage, and
Said goodbye to family and friends
And took a road to nowhere on my own
Like Dorothy on a yellow brick
Hope my ruby shoes get us there quick
'Cause I left everyone I love at home

[Chorus 1]
I don't wanna be alone forever, but I can be tonight
I don't wanna be alone forever, but I love gypsy life
I don't wanna be alone forever
Maybe we can see the world together
I don't wanna be alone forever, but I can be
Tonight!
Tonight!

[Hook]
'Cause I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm a gypsy, gypsy, gypsy, I'm
I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm a gypsy, gypsy, gypsy, I'm
I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm a gypsy, gypsy, gypsy, I'm
I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm a gypsy, gypsy, gypsy, I'm

[Bridge]
And then he asked me, he said
"Baby, why do we love each other?"
I said, "Honey, it's simple
It's the way that you love and treat your mother."

[Chorus 2]
Thought that I would be alone forever, but I won't be tonight
I'm a man without a home, but I think with you, I could spend my life
And you'll be my little gypsy princess
Pack your bags and we can chase the sunset
Bust the rearview and fire up the jets
'Cause it's you and me
Baby, for life 
For life 

[Hook]
'Cause I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm a gypsy, gypsy, gypsy, I'm
I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm a gypsy, gypsy, gypsy, I'm

[Outro]
Russia, UK, Paris
I'm Italian, Asian kompai
Africa, India, I'm a gypsy, gypsy, gypsy
I'm Latin-American
I don't speak German, but I try
Someday in Jakarta
I'm American, I'm gypsy
I'm Bangkok, Australian, Malaysia
Sweden, Finland, Norway
Be my home just for the day
I'm a gypsy, gypsy, gypsy
Hey...

[Intro: Spoken]
It's like, I just love a cowboy
You know
I'm just like, I just, I know, it's bad
But I'm just like
Can I just like, hang off the back of your horse
And can you go a little faster?!

[Verse 1]
3 am, mustang speedin'
Two lovers, headed for a dead end
Too fast, hold tight, he laughs
Runnin' through the red lights
Hollerin' over, rubber spinnin'
Big swig, toss another beer can
Too lit, tonight, prayin'
On the moonlight

[Pre-Chorus]
Every John is just the same
I'm sick of their city games
I crave a real wild man
I'm strung out on John Wayne

[Chorus]


Baby let's get high, John Wayne


Baby let's get high, John Wayne

[Verse 2]
Blue collar and a red-state treasure
Love junkie on a three-day bender
His grip, so hard, eyes glare
Trouble like a mug shot
Charged up, 'cause the man's on a mission
1-2 ya, the gears are shiftin'
He called, I cried, we broke
Racin' through the moonlight

[Pre-Chorus]
Every John is just the same
I'm sick of their city games
I crave a real wild man
I'm strung out on John Wayne

[Chorus]


Baby let's get high, John Wayne


Baby let's get high, John Wayne

[Bridge]
So here I go
To the eye
Of the storm
Just to feel your love
Knock me over
Here I go
Into our love storm

[Chorus]


Baby let's get high, John Wayne


Baby let's get high, John Wayne

[Intro]
I know that we are young, and I know that you may love me
But I just can't be with you like this anymore
Alejandro...

[Verse 1]
She's got both hands in her pocket
And she won't look at you, won't look at you
She hides true love, en su bolsillo
She's got a halo around her finger, around you

[Pre-Chorus]
You know that I love you, boy
Hot, like Mexico, rejoice
At this point, I've gotta choose
Nothing to lose

[Chorus]
Don't call my name, don't call my name, Alejandro
I'm not your babe, I'm not your babe, Fernando
Don't wanna kiss, don't wanna touch
Just smoke my cigarette and hush
Don't call my name, don't call my name, Roberto
Alejandro, Alejandro
Ale-Alejandro, Ale-Alejandro
Alejandro, Alejandro
Ale-Alejandro, Ale-Alejandro

[Interlude]
Stop, please, just let me go
Alejandro, just let me go

[Verse 2]
She's not broken
She's just a baby
But her boyfriend's like her dad, just like her dad
And all those flames that burned before him
Now he's gotta firefight, gotta cool the bad

[Pre-Chorus]
You know that I love you, boy
Hot, like Mexico, rejoice
At this point, I've gotta choose
Nothing to lose

[Chorus]
Don't call my name, don't call my name, Alejandro
I'm not your babe, I'm not your babe, Fernando
Don't wanna kiss, don't wanna touch
Just smoke my cigarette and hush
Don't call my name, don't call my name, Roberto
Alejandro, Alejandro
Ale-Alejandro, Ale-Alejandro
Alejandro, Alejandro
Ale-Alejandro, Ale-Alejandro

[Bridge]
Don't bother me, don't bother me
Alejandro
Don't call my name, don't call my name
Bye, Fernando
I'm not your babe, I'm not your babe
Alejandro
Don't wanna kiss
Don't wanna touch
Fernando
Don't call my name, don't call my name
Alejandro
I'm not your babe, I'm not your babe
Fernando
Don't wanna kiss, don't wanna touch
Just smoke my cigarette and hush
Don't call my name, don't call my name
Roberto

[Outro]
Alejandro, Alejandro
Ale-Alejandro, Ale-Alejandro
Alejandro, Alejandro
Ale-Alejandro, Ale-Alejandro
 Alejandro, Alejandro
 Ale-Alejandro, Ale-Alejandro 
 Alejandro, Alejandro
Ale-Alejandro, Ale-Alejandro 
 Alejandro, Alejandro
Ale-Alejandro, Ale-Alejandro 
Alejandro

[Verse 1]
Life is so simple
A little boy, a little girl
Laughing and loving
Tryin' to figure out the world
It felt like summer when I kissed you in the rain
And I know your story but tell me again

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Nothing you say wouldn't interest me
All of your words are like poems to me
I would be honored if you would take me as I am

[Chorus]
I want you
To look right in my eyes
To tell me you love me
To be by my side
I want you
At the end of my life
Wanna see your face
When I fall with grace
At the moment I die
Is that alright?
Is that alright?

[Verse 2]
I hope youre still with me
When Im not quite myself
And I pray that youll lift me
When you know I need help
Its a warm celebration of all of our years
I dream of our story of our fairytale

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Family dinners and family trees
Teachin' the kids to say thank you and please
Knowing if we stay together that things will be right

[Chorus]
I want you
To look right in my eyes
To tell me you love me
To be by my side
I want you
At the end of my life
Wanna see your face
When I fall with grace
At the moment I die
Is that alright?
Is that alright?

[Outro]
Is that alright?

[Verse 1]
We are the crowd
We're c-coming out
Got my flash on, it's true
Need that picture of you, it's so magical
We'd be so fantastical
Leather and jeans
Garage glamorous
Not sure what it means
But this photo of us, it don't have a price
Ready for those flashing lights
'Cause you know that, baby, I...

[Chorus]
I'm your biggest fan
I'll follow you until you love me
Papa-paparazzi
Baby, there's no other superstar you know that I'll be
Your papa-paparazzi
Promise I'll be kind
But I won't stop until that boy is mine
Baby, you'll be famous
Chase you down until you love me
Papa-paparazzi

[Verse 2]
I'll be your girl backstage at your show
Velvet ropes and guitars
Yeah, 'cause you're my rockstar in between the sets
Eyeliner and cigarettes
Shadow is burnt
Yellow dance and we turn
My lashes are dry
Purple teardrops, I cry
It don't have a price
Loving you is cherry pie
'Cause you know that, baby, I...

[Chorus]
I'm your biggest fan
I'll follow you until you love me
Papa-paparazzi
Baby, there's no other superstar you know that I'll be
Your papa-paparazzi
Promise I'll be kind
But I won't stop until that boy is mine
Baby, you'll be famous
Chase you down until you love me
Papa-paparazzi

[Bridge]
Real good
We dance in the studio
Snap snap to that shit on the radio
Don't stop for anyone
We're plastic, but we still have fun!

[Chorus]
I'm your biggest fan
I'll follow you until you love me
Papa-paparazzi
Baby, there's no other superstar you know that I'll be
Your papa-paparazzi
Promise I'll be kind
But I won't stop until that boy is mine
Baby, you'll be famous
Chase you down until you love me
Papa-paparazzi
Promise I'll be kind
But I won't stop until that boy is mine
Baby, you'll be famous
Chase you down until you love me
Papa-paparazzi

[Verse 1]
Lady of the 'Dam
Won't be a slave to the blonde, or the culture of the popular

Sing at you, I'll fly under radar tonight
Make deals with every devil in sight


[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause I love, love, 'cause I love, love
You better than, you better than
My darkest sin
Russian hookers, and cheap gin

[Chorus]
I think that I could be fine
If I could be Mary Jane Holland tonight
I think we'd have a good time
If you'd meet me and Mary Jane in Holland tonight

[Post-Chorus]
Mary! Jane! Holland!

Mary! Jane! Holland!


[Verse 2]
I don't like to boast
But our truffles are the most
Mad-magical in Amsterdam

So if you have fear, Apollo
Sit on my lyre, and play him like a piano, man


[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause I love, love, 'cause I love, love
You better than, you better than
My darkest sin
Russian hookers, and cheap gin

[Chorus]
I think that I could be fine
If I could be Mary Jane Holland tonight
I think we'd have a good time
If you'd meet me and Mary Jane in Holland tonight

[Post-Chorus]
Mary! Jane! Holland!

Mary! Jane! Holland!


[Bridge]
I know that Mom and Dad think I'm a mess
But it's alright, because I am rich as piss
When I ignite the flames and put you in my mouth
The grass eats up my insides, and my brunette starts to sprout
Introducing, ladies and gentleman, Mary Jane Holland!

[Chorus]
I think that I could be fine
If I could be Mary Jane Holland tonight
I think we'd have a good time
If you'd meet me and Mary Jane in Holland tonight

[Post-Chorus]
Mary! Jane! Holland!

Mary! Jane! Holland!

Mary! Jane! Holland!

Mary! Jane! Holland!
[Verse 1]
Cork's off, it's on
The party's just begun
I promise this drink is my last one
I know I fucked up again
Because I lost my only friend
God, forgive my sins
Don't leave me, I
Oh, I'll hate myself until I die

[Chorus]
My heart would break without you
Might not awake without you
Been hurting low from living high for so long
I'm sorry, and I love you
Stay with me, "Bell Bottom Blue"
I'll keep on searching for an answer, 'cause I need you more than dope

[Post-Chorus]
I need you more than dope
Need you more than dope
Need you more than dope
I need you more than dope

[Verse 2]
Toast, one last puff and two last regrets
Three spirits and twelve lonely steps
Up heaven's stairway to gold
Mine myself like coal
A mountain of a soul
Each day, I cry
Oh, I feel so low from living high

[Chorus]
My heart would break without you
Might not awake without you
Been hurting low from living high for so long
I'm sorry, and I love you
Stay with me, "Bell Bottom Blue"
I'll keep on searching for an answer, 'cause I need you more than dope

[Post-Chorus]
I need you more than dope
Need you more than dope
Need you more than dope
I need you more than dope

[Outro]
I need you more
Need you more
I need you more than dope

[Intro]
Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa
Im in love with Juda-as, Juda-as
Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa
Im in love with Juda-as, Juda-as

Judas, Juda-ah-ah
Judas, Juda-ah-ah

Judas, Gaga
Judas, Juda-ah-ah
Judas, Juda-ah-ah
Judas, Juda-ah-ah
Judas, Gaga

[Verse 1]
When he calls to me, I am ready
I'll wash his feet with my hair if he needs
Forgive him when his tongue lies through his brain
Even after three times he betrays me

[Pre-Chorus]

I'll bring him down
Bring him down, down

A king with no crown
King with no crown

[Chorus]
I'm just a Holy Fool, oh baby
It's so cruel, but I'm still in love with Judas, baby
I'm just a Holy Fool, oh baby
It's so cruel, but I'm still in love with Judas, baby
Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa

[Interlude]
Judas, Juda-ah-ah
Judas, Juda-ah-ah
Judas, Juda-ah-ah
Judas, Gaga

[Verse 2]
I couldn't love a man so purely
Even prophets forgave his crooked ways
I've learned love is like a brick
You can build a house or sink a dead body

[Pre-Chorus]

I'll bring him down
Bring him down, down

A king with no crown
King with no crown

[Chorus]
I'm just a Holy Fool, oh baby
It's so cruel, but I'm still in love with Judas, baby
I'm just a Holy Fool, oh baby
It's so cruel, but I'm still in love with Judas, baby
Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa
Im in love with Juda-as, Juda-as
Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa
Im in love with Juda-as, Juda-as

[Breakdown]
Ew...
In the most Biblical sense, I am beyond repentance
Fame hooker, prostitute, wench vomits her mind
But in the cultural sense, I just speak in future tense
Judas, kiss me, if offensed, or wear ear condom next time

[Bridge]
I wanna love you
But somethings pulling me away from you
Jesus is my virtue and
Judas is the demon I cling to
I cling to

[Chorus]
I'm just a Holy Fool, oh baby
It's so cruel, but I'm still in love with Judas, baby
I'm just a Holy Fool, oh baby
It's so cruel, but I'm still in love with Judas, baby
Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa
Im in love with Juda-as, Juda-as
Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa
Im in love with Juda-as, Juda-as

[Outro]
Judas, Juda-ah-ah
Judas, Juda-ah-ah
Judas, Juda-ah-ah
Judas, Gaga

[Verse 1]
Take my hand, stay Joanne
Heaven's not
Ready for you
Every part
Of my aching heart
Needs you more
Than the angels do

[Chorus]
Girl
Where do you think you're goin'?
Where do you think you're goin'
Goin', girl?
Girl
Where do you think you're goin'?
Where do you think you're goin'
Goin', girl?

[Verse 2]
If you could
I know that you'd stay
We both know
Things don't work that way
I promised I
Wouldn't say goodbye
So I grin
And my voice gets thin

[Chorus]
Girl
Where do you think you're goin'?
Where do you think you're goin'
Goin', girl?
Girl
Where do you think you're goin'?
Where do you think you're goin'
Goin', girl?

[Bridge]
Honestly, I know where you're goin'
And baby, you're just movin' on
And I'll still love you even if I can't
See you anymore
Can't wait to see you soar

[Chorus]
Girl
Where do you think you're goin'?
Where do you think you're goin'
Goin', girl?
Girl
Where do you think you're goin'?
Where do you think you're goin'
Goin', girl?

[Verse 1: Lady Gaga]
Wish I could
I could have said goodbye
I would have said what I wanted to
Maybe even cried for you
If I knew it would be the last time
I would have broke my heart in two
Tryin' to save a part of you

[Chorus: Lady Gaga]
Don't want to feel another touch
Don't want to start another fire
Don't want to know another kiss
No other name falling off my lips
Don't want to give my heart away
To another stranger
Or let another day begin
Won't even let the sunlight in
No I'll never love again
I'll never love again
Oh, oh, oh

Oh

[Verse 2: Lady Gaga]
When we first met
I never thought that I would fall
I never thought that I'd find myself lyin' in your arms
Mmmm mmmm
And I wanna pretend that it's not true oh baby that you're gone
Cause my world keeps turnin' and turnin' and turnin' and I'm not movin' on

[Chorus: Lady Gaga]
Don't want to feel another touch
Don't want to start another fire
Don't want to know another kiss
No other name falling off my lips
Don't want to give my heart away
To another stranger
Or let another day begin
Won't even let the sunlight in
No I'll never love

[Bridge: Lady Gaga]
I don't wanna know this feeling unless it's you and me
I don't wanna waste a moment
Hoooo ouuu
And I don't wanna give somebody else the better part of me
I would rather wait for you
Hoooo ouuu

[Chorus: Lady Gaga]
Don't want to feel another touch
Don't want to start another fire
Don't want to know another kiss
Baby unless they are your lips

[Outro: Bradley Cooper]
Don't want to give my heart away
To another stranger
Don't let another day begin
Won't let the sunlight in
Oh I'll never love again
Never love again
Never love again
Oh I'll never love again

[Verse 1]
Put some lipstick on
Perfume your neck and slip your high heels on
Rinse and curl your hair
Loosen your hips and get a dress to wear
I'm the one who's been coming 'round
Looking to love in you
You're the medicine, I need to heal
The way you make me feel

[Chorus]
I'm gon' be MANiCURED
You wanna be man cured
Ma-ma-ma-MANiCURE
She wanna be man cured
Salons enough for her not to feel so insecure
Ma-ma-ma-MANiCURE
She wanna be take care'n of

[Post-Chorus]
Can you feel it? Can you feel it?
Can you feel it? Im addicted to the love that you garner
Can you feel it? Can you feel it?
Can you feel it? Looking serial killer, man is a goner

[Verse 2]
Touch me in the dark
Put your hands all over my body parts
Throw me on the bed
Squeeze, tease me, please me, that's what I said!
'Cause I'm the trick who's been coming 'round
Looking to love in you
You're the, the medicine
I need to heal the way, the way, the way you make me feel

[Chorus]
I'm gon' be MANiCURED
You wanna be man cured
Ma-ma-ma-MANiCURE
She wanna be man cured
Salons enough for her
Not to feel so insecure
Ma-ma-ma-MANiCURE
She wanna be take care'n of

[Post-Chorus]

Can you feel it? Im addicted to the love that you garner
Can you feel it? Can you feel it?

[Bridge]
Man cure

Heal me, 'cause I'm addicted to love
Save me, 'cause I'm addicted to love
Man cure

[Chorus]
I'm gon' be MANiCURED
You wanna be man cured
Ma-ma-ma-MANiCURE
She wanna be man cured
Salons enough for her

[Post-Chorus]
Can you feel it? Can you feel it?
Can you feel it? Im addicted to the love that you garner
Can you feel it? Can you feel it?
Can you feel it? Looking serial killer, man is a goner

[Verse 1]
Come to me
In all your glamour and cruelty
Just do that thing that you do
And I'll undress you
Keep it tight
Sometimes the simplest move is right
The melody that you choose can rescue you

[Pre-Chorus 1]
A hybrid can withstand these things
My heart can beat with bricks and strings
My ARTPOP could mean anything

[Chorus]
We could, we could belong together 
We could, we could belong together 
We could, we could belong together 

[Verse 2]
Come to me
With all your subtext and fantasy
Just do that thing that you do
In a perverse hue
Lovers' kites are flown on beaches for public sight
The color palette you choose could profit you

[Pre-Chorus 2]
A hybrid can withstand these things
My heart can beat with bricks and strings
My ARTPOP could mean anything
Could try to sell you out
Or I could show you all the reasons why
My ARTPOP could mean anything

[Chorus]
We could, we could belong together 
We could, we could belong together 
We could, we could belong together 

[Bridge]
Brushes with darkness won't help you create
Your destiny of self, but ARTPOP could mean anything, anything
I try to sell myself, but I am really laughing
Because I just love the music, not the bling
The music, not the bling

[Chorus]
We could, we could belong together 
We could, we could belong together 
We could, we could belong together 
We could, we could belong together 
We could, we could belong together 
We could, we could belong together 

[Outro]
Free my mind, ARTPOP
You make my, heart stop

[Verse 1]
Hush up
Don't speak, don't wanna hear another

You're just an animal, trying to act real special


[Pre-Chorus]
Maybe I should have a little more just to stay out of my mind
'Cause it's when I'm not thinking with you that I act like a swine
Act like a swine
Act like a swine

[Chorus]
I know, I know, I know, I know you want me
You're just a pig inside a human body
Squealer, squealer, squeal out, you're so disgusting
You're just a pig inside
Do ya? I know, I know, I know you want me
You're just a pig inside a human body
Squealer, squealer, squeal out, you're so disgusting
You're just a pig inside
Swine, swine
Swine, swine

[Drop]
Swine! Swine!

[Verse 2]
Be that hog, sweat it out, you squealer

Slap her skin, he loves to watch your ass go wiggle


[Pre-Chorus]
Maybe I should have a little more just to stay out of my mind
'Cause it's when I'm not thinking with you that I act like a swine
Act like a swine
Act like a swine

[Chorus]
I know, I know, I know, I know you want me
You're just a pig inside a human body
Squealer, squealer, squeal out, you're so disgusting
You're just a pig inside
Do ya? I know, I know, I know you want me
You're just a pig inside a human body
Squealer, squealer, squeal out, you're so disgusting
You're just a pig inside
Swine, swine
Swine, swine

[Drop]
Swine!

[Outro]
Paint your face and
Paint his face and catch the beat
Paint your face and
Paint her face and catch the beat
Paint your face and
Be a swine just catch the beat
For the weekend
Catch the beat
C-catch the beat
Huh huh
C-catch the beat
C-catch the beat
Swine!

[Verse 1: Lady Gaga]
Its been a long time since I came around
Been a long time, but Im back in town
This time Im not leaving without you
You taste like whiskey when you kiss me, oh
I'd give anything again to be your baby doll
This time Im not leaving without you

[Pre-Chorus: Lady Gaga]
He said, "Sit back down where you belong
In the corner of my bar with your high heels on
Sit back down on the couch where we
Made love the first time and you said to me,"
Theres...

[Chorus: Lady Gaga & ]
, something about this place
, something, bout lonely nights
And my lipstick on your face
Something, something about my cool Nebraska guy
Yeah, there's something about, baby, you and I

[Verse 2: Lady Gaga]
Its been two years since I let you go
I couldnt listen to a joke or a Rock and Roll
Muscle cars drove a truck right through my heart
On my birthday you sang me "Heart of Gold"
With a guitar humming and a no clothes
This time Im not leaving without you

[Pre-Chorus: Lady Gaga]
He said, "Sit back down where you belong
In the corner of my bar with your high heels on
Sit back down on the couch where we
Made love the first time and you said to me,"
Theres...

[Chorus: Lady Gaga & ]
, something about this place
, something, bout lonely nights
And my lipstick on your face
Something, something about my cool Nebraska guy
Yeah, there's something about, baby, you and I

[Post-Chorus: Lady Gaga]
You and I
You, you and I
You, you and I
You, you and I, I
You and I
You, you and I
Oh yeah, well, I'd rather die
Without you and I, I
C'mon! Put your drinks up!

[Bridge: Lady Gaga]
We got a whole lot of money, but we still pay rent
'Cause you can't buy a house in Heaven
There's only three men that I'ma serve my whole life
It's my daddy, and Nebraska, and Jesus Christ
There's...

[Chorus: Lady Gaga & ]
, something, something about the chase
Six whole years
I'm a New York woman born to run you down
Still want my lipstick all over your face
Something, something about
Just knowing when it's right
So put your drinks up, for Nebraska
For Nebraska, Nebraska, I love ya

[Final Chorus: Lady Gaga & Brian May]
You and I
You, you and I
Baby, I'd rather die
Without you and I, I
You and I
You, you and I
Nebraska, I'd rather die
Without you and I, I

[Outro: Lady Gaga]
It's been a long time since I came around
Been a long time, but I'm back in town
And this time I'm not leaving without you

Put on a show tonight, do whatever you like
Scheie, scheie be mine, scheie be mine 

[Pre-Chorus]
When I'm on a mission
I rebuke my condition
If you're a strong female
You don't need permission

[Verse 2]
Love is objectified by what men say is right
Scheie, scheie be mine, bullshit be mine
Blonde high-heeled feminists, enlisting femmes for this
Express your womankind, fight for your right 

[Pre-Chorus]
 When I'm on a mission
 I rebuke my condition
 If you're a strong female
 You don't need permission

 I wish that I could dance on a single prayer
 I wish I could be strong without somebody there

[Verse 1: Lady Gaga & Akon]
I've had a little bit too much, much 
All of the people start to rush 
A dizzy twister dance
Can't find my drink or man
Where are my keys?
I lost my phone, phone 

[Pre-Chorus: Lady Gaga]
What's going on on the floor?
I love this record, baby, but I can't see straight anymore
Keep it cool
What's the name of this club?
I can't remember, but it's alright, alright

[Chorus: Lady Gaga]
Just dance
Gonna be okay
Da-da-doo-doot-n, just dance
Spin that record, babe
Da-da-doo-doot-n, just dance
Gonna be okay

How'd I turn my shirt inside out? 
Control your poison, babe
Roses have thorns, they say
And we're all gettin' hosed tonight 

[Pre-Chorus: Lady Gaga]
What's going on on the floor?
I love this record, baby, but I can't see straight anymore

[Verse 3: Colby O'Donis]
When I come through on the dance floor, checking out that catalogue
Can't believe my eyes
So many women without a flaw
And I ain't gonna give it up
Steady, tryna pick it up, like a call
I'mma hit it, I'mma beat it and latch onto it until tomorrow, yeah
Shorty, I can see that you got so much energy
The way you twirling up them hips 'round and 'round
And there is no reason at all why you can't leave here with me
In the meantime, stay and let me watch you break it down

[Chorus: Lady Gaga & Akon]
And dance
Gonna be okay

[Intro]
1-2-3

[Verse 1]
I'm alone in my house
I'm out on the town
I'm at the bottom of the bottle
I've been knockin' 'em down

[Pre-Chorus 1]
I can't get back up on my feet
See the lights on the street like stars

[Chorus 1]
But look what I found
Look what I found
Another piece of my heart
Just layin' on the ground

[Verse 2]
Under the foggy day
Im lookin' for a light
And my only friend
Is workin' tonight

[Pre-Chorus 2]
I cant get myself out of bed
Hear these voices in my head like a song

[Chorus 2]
But look what I found
Somebody who loves me
Look what I found
Somebody who'll carry 'round a piece of my heart
Just layin' on the ground

[Bridge]
When I met you I was blown to pieces
Heart all over the floor
Ever since you put me back together
I cant believe it wont believe it
Uh

[Chorus 3]
Look what you found!
Yeah baby
Look what I found
Someone who'll carry 'round a piece of my heart
Look what I found
Whoo!
C'mon!
Look what I found
Somebody who loves me
Look what we found
Somebody who'll carry 'round a piece of my heart
Heart just layin' on the ground

[Intro: T.I.]
Yeah, it's about that time, yeah
Time ta take off partna, alright?
Hustle Gang, uh huh, G-D-O-G
Get your doe or die, partna
Yup, leggo

[Verse 1: T.I.]
Still Bankhead, shawty, yeah, you know what it is
Pockets full of numbers, rubber bands and bills
Came up from 'round, that standard wheel
Was finna do a de, 'bout 60 mill
You ain't lived that life, you perpetrating
You wasn't really trapping circling birds of prey
You ain't have to beat no murder case
Man, you probably couldn't get a ho any da
'Round my way can't get murder planned
Ain't no hoop, play dirty, man
Put some through your jersey, man
If your partner want some, we can do it again
Okay, H-U-S-T-L-E G-A-N-G, yeah, wait
Yeah, pull up, pull up, hop out, hop out
All about the dollar, better go ahead, Gaga

[Chorus: Lady Gaga]
Don't want your jewels, I want your drugs
Don't want your money, want your love
Don't want your jewels, I want your drugs
Want your jewels, I want your drugs
Don't want your money, want your love

[Verse 2: Lady Gaga]
I admit that my habit's expensive
And you may find it quite offensive
But I won't die at the hands of another
I'm your mother, sister, father, brother
This family is stupid attractive
And you've surveyed the way weve acted
Keep it coming, I'm coming around like your friend now
I think you should shut up and sit down

[Chorus: Lady Gaga]
Don't want your jewels, I want your drugs
Don't want your money, want your love
Don't want your jewels, I want your drugs
Want your jewels, I want your drugs
Don't want your money, want your love

[Verse 3: Too $hort]
Everybody want that money, what you want
High as hell, trying to have some fucking fun
You don't need 'em, but the diamonds make it shine
Tried to kick it just can't find the time
It's the middle of the week, this ain't even the weekend
Red carpet event, every time you see pimps
It's good pussy in the passenger seat
My lil' homies hang with me, I be passing 'em freaks
Bitch!

[Bridge: Lady Gaga]
Jewels and drugs, baby, hustle
Smother 'em if you want to be bad
Slap honey on a young pancake
We know how to make that money
Jewels and drugs, baby, hustle
Smother 'em if you want to be bad
Ain't nothing if it ain't family
We know how to make that money

[iTunes Festival: Beat Break]
DJ White Shadow!

[Verse 4: Twista]
Come and show me the gateway into your love
I feel like the money can never do it like the club
I feel like a diamond can never do it like a drug
And I want it so come on and take it with me so that I can hit it
I can admit it, I am influenced by desire when I approach her
I try to provoke her by giving her money and jewelry and accessories
Instead of the recipe with a legacy of taking her to another place when I get it
Hold up
Twista going in warp speed breaking atoms
Blowing O.G. has got me creating antimatter
Let her pop it and smoke on it with me now
I got her because she ready to party and then move to the club
Because you know the way I think is an anomaly
And I'mma be strange as Lady Gaga
Probably a dollar be the business, but I'd rather be in an outer dimension when I be talking about jewels and drugs

[Outro: Lady Gaga]
Jewels and drugs, baby, hustle
Smother 'em if you want to be bad
Slap honey on a young pancake
We know how to make that money
Jewels and drugs, baby, hustle
Smother 'em if you want to be bad
Ain't nothing if it ain't family
We know how to make that money

Hey!
Hey!

I wanna kiss you
But if I do, then I might miss you, babe
It's complicated and stupid
Got my ass squeezed by sexy Cupid
Guess he wants to play, wants to play a lovegame, a lovegame

[Pre-Chorus]
Hold me and love me
Just wanna touch you for a minute
Maybe three seconds is enough for my heart to quit it
Let's have some fun, this beat is sick

Don't think too much, just bust that kick
I wanna take a ride on your disco stick

Are you in the game?
Dans, the lovegame

I'm educated in sex, yes
And now I want it bad, want it bad
A lovegame, a lovegame

[Pre-Chorus]
Hold me and love me
Just wanna touch you for a minute
Maybe three seconds is enough for my heart to quit it
Let's have some fun, this beat is sick
I wanna take a ride on your disco stick
Don't think too much, just bust that kick
I wanna take a ride on your disco stick

Yeah, okay
You need to get done, done, done, done at work, come over
We just need to slow the motion
Don't give that away to no one
Long distance, I need you
When I see potential I just gotta see it through
If you had a twin, I would still choose you
I don't wanna rush into it, if it's too soon
But I know you need to get done, done, done, done
If you come over
Sorry if I'm way less friendly
I got niggas tryna end me, oh
I spilled all my emotions tonight, Im sorry
Rollin', rollin', rollin', rollin', rollin'
How many more shots until you're rollin'?
We just need a face to face
You could pick the time and the place
You spent some time away

Mustard on the beat, ho!

[Verse 1]
I was good on my own, that's the way it was
That's the way it was
You was good on the low for a faded fuck
On some faded love
Shit, what the fuck you complaining for?
Feeling jaded, huh?
Used to trip off that shit I was kickin' to you
Had some fun on the run though I'll give it to you

[Pre-Chorus]
But baby, don't get it twisted
You was just another nigga on the hit list
Tryna fix your inner issues with a bad bitch
Didn't they tell you that I was a savage?
Fuck ya white horse and ya carriage
Bet you never could imagine
Never told you you could have it

[Chorus]
You needed me
Ooh, you needed me
To feel a little more, and give a little less
Know you hate to confess
But baby ooh, you needed me

[Verse 2]
You been rollin' around, shit I'm rollin' up
Light and roll it up
Break it down, like a pound, shit was never us
Shit was never us

How you feel, how you feel?
Used to trip off that shit I was kickin' to ya
Had some fun on the run though, I'll give it to ya

[Pre-Chorus]
But baby, don't get it twisted
You was just another nigga on the hit list
Tryna fix your inner issues with a bad bitch

Never told you you could have it

[Chorus]
You needed me
Ooh, you needed me
To feel a little more, and give a little less
Know you hate to confess
But baby ooh, you needed me

[Verse 1]
And you got me like, "Oh, what you want from me?"

And I tried to buy your pretty heart, but the price too high
Baby, you got me like "Oh"

A cold sweat, hot-headed believer
I threw my hands in the air, said, "Show me something"
He said, If you dare, come a little closer

[Pre-Chorus: Rihanna]
Round and around and around and around we go
Oh now, tell me now, tell me now, tell me now you know

[Verse 1: Rihanna]
I came fluttering in from Neverland
Time can never stop me, no, no, no, no
I know you've tried to
I came riding in on a pale white horse
Handing out highs to less fortunate
I do advise you
Run it back, run it on back
When you breaking it down for me
Cause I can't hear you, two times
Run it on back, will it ever make sense to me?

[Chorus: Rihanna]
I got to do things my own way darling
Will you ever let me
Will you ever respect me? No
Do things my own way darling
You should just let me
Why you ain't ever let me grow?

[Post-Chorus: SZA]
When I look outside my window
I can't get no piece of mind
When I look outside my window
I can't get no peace of mind

[Verse 2: Rihanna]
Let me cover your shit in glitter
I could make it gold, gold
Heard you tryna sell your soul, baby
Word on the street, you run it low lately
I needed you to please give my reflection a break
From the face its seeing now
Ooh darling, gahhlee
Would you mind giving my reflection a break
From the pain its feeling now?

[Chorus: Rihanna & SZA]
I got to do things my own way darling
You should just let me
Will you ever respect me? No
Do things my own way darling
You should just let me
Why you ain't ever let me grow?

I can't get no peace of mind

Get, get, getting no peace
Can't get no peace

Mhm, take it easy
I'm not tryna go against yuh
Actually, I'm goin' witcha

You need me, there ain't no leaving me behind
Never, no, no, I just want outta here, yeah

[Chorus]
If you want, we can be runaways
Running from any sight of love
Yeah, yeah, there aint nothin'
There ain't nothin' here for me
There ain't nothin' here for me anymore
But I don't wanna be alone

[Verse 2]
Desperado
Sitting on your ole' Monte Carlo
We've both had our hearts broke
Unh, hunh, take it easy

I can be a lone wolf witcha

[Pre-Chorus]
Gotta get up out of here
And you ain't leaving me behind
I know you won't cause we share common interests
You need me, there ain't no leaving me behind
Never, no, no, both want outta here, yeah

[Verse 1]
I can just hear them now
"How could you let us down?"
But they don't know what I found
Or see it from this way around
Feeling it overtake
All that I used to hate
Worried 'bout every trait
I tried but it's way too late
All the signs I don't read
Two sides of me can't agree
When I breathe in too deep
Going with what I always longed for

[Chorus 1]
Feel like a brand new person

Well, I dont care Im in love

Feel like a brand new person

I finally know what it's like




And I still dont know why its happening

And I still dont know

[Verse 2]
Finally taking flight
I know you don't think it's right
I know that you think it's fake
Maybe fake's what I like
Point is I have the right
Not thinking in black and white
I'm thinking it's worth the fight
Soon to be out of sight
Knowing it all this time
Going with what I always longed for

[Chorus 1]
Feel like a brand new person

I dont care Im in love

Feel like a brand new person

So how do I know that it's right?



[Bridge]
And I know that it's hard to digest
But maybe your story aint so different from the rest
And I know it seems wrong to accept
But you've got your demons, and she's got her regrets
And I know that it's hard to digest
A realization is as good as it gets
And I know it seems wrong to accept
But you've got your demons, and she's got her regrets
But you've got your demons, and she's got her regrets

[Chorus 2]
Feel like a brand new person
So, how will I know that it's right?
In a new direction
So, how will I know I've gone too far?

Feel like a brand new person

I finally know what it's like


In a new direction

So how will I know I've gone too far?



Feel like a brand new person

And I know it's hard to describe




I finally know what it's like


[Chorus: Rihanna]

Okay, away we go
Only thing we have on is the radio

The things that we could do in twenty minutes girl
Say my name, say my name, wear it out

[Verse 1: JAY-Z]
No clouds in my stones
Let it rain, I hydroplane in the bank
Coming down with the Dow Jones
When the clouds come, we gone, we Roc-A-Fella
We fly higher than weather, in G5's or better
You know me 
In anticipation for precipitation, stack chips for the rainy day
JayRain Man is back
With Little Miss Sunshine, Rihanna, where you at?

[Verse 2: Rihanna]
You have my heart
And we'll never be worlds apart
Maybe in magazines
But you'll still be my star
Baby, cause in the dark
You can't see shiny cars
And that's when you need me there
With you, I'll always share
Because

[Chorus: Rihanna]
When the sun shine, we shine together
Told you I'll be here forever
Said I'll always be your friend
Took an oath, I'ma stick it out to the end
Now that it's raining more than ever
Know that we'll still have each other
You can stand under my umbrella
You can stand under my umbrella, ella, ella, eh, eh, eh
Under my umbrella, ella, ella, eh, eh, eh
Under my umbrella, ella, ella, eh, eh, eh
Under my umbrella, ella, ella, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh-eh

[Verse 3: Rihanna]
These fancy things
Will never come in between
You're part of my entity
Here for infinity
When the war has took its part
When the world has dealt its cards
If the hand is hard
Together we'll mend your heart
Because

[Chorus: Rihanna]
When the sun shine, we shine together
Told you I'll be here forever
Said I'll always be your friend
Took an oath, I'ma stick it out to the end
Now that it's raining more than ever
Know that we'll still have each other
You can stand under my umbrella
You can stand under my umbrella, ella, ella, eh, eh, eh
Under my umbrella, ella, ella, eh, eh, eh
Under my umbrella, ella, ella, eh, eh, eh
Under my umbrella, ella, ella, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh-eh

[Bridge: Rihanna]
You can run into my arms
It's okay, don't be alarmed
Come into me
There's no distance in between our love
So gon' and let the rain pour
I'll be all you need and more
Because

[Chorus: Rihanna]
When the sun shine, we shine together
Told you I'll be here forever
Said I'll always be your friend
Took an oath, I'ma stick it out to the end
Now that it's raining more than ever
Know that we'll still have each other
You can stand under my umbrella
You can stand under my umbrella, ella, ella, eh, eh, eh
Under my umbrella, ella, ella, eh, eh, eh
Under my umbrella, ella, ella, eh, eh, eh
Under my umbrella, ella, ella, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh-eh

[Outro: Rihanna]
It's rainin', rainin'
Ooh, baby, it's rainin', rainin'
Baby, come here to me
Come into me
It's rainin', rainin'
Ooh, baby, it's rainin', rainin'
You can always come into me
Come into me
It's pourin' rain
It's pourin' rain
Come here to me
Come into me
It's pourin' rain
It's pourin' rain

[Verse]
This whiskey got me feelin' pretty
So pardon if I'm impolite
I just really need your ass with me
I'm sorry 'bout the other night
And I know I could be more creative
And come up with poetic lines
But I'm turnt up upstairs and I love you
Is the only thing that's in my mind

[Chorus]
You take me higher, higher than I've ever been, babe
Just come over, let's pour a drink, babe
I hope I ain't calling you too late, too late
You light my fire
Let's stay up late and smoke a J
I wanna go back to the old way
But I'm drunk instead, with a full ashtray
With a little bit too much to say

[Verse 1: Rihanna]
On the first page of our story
The future seemed so bright
Then this thing turned out so evil
I dont know why Im still surprised
Even angels have their wicked schemes
And you take that to new extremes
But youll always be my hero
Even though youve lost your mind

[Chorus: Rihanna]
Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
But thats all right because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
But thats all right because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
Ohhh, I love the way you lie

[Verse 2: Rihanna]
Now theres gravel in our voices
Glass is shattered from the fight
In this tug of war, youll always win
Even when Im right
Cause you feed me fables from your head
The violent words and empty threats
And its sick that all these battles
Are what keeps me satisfied

[Chorus: Rihanna]
Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
But thats all right because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
But thats all right because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
Ohhh, I love the way you lie

[Bridge: Rihanna]
So maybe Im a masochist
I try to run but I dont wanna ever leave
'Till the walls are going up
In smoke with all our memories

[Verse 3: Eminem]
It's morning, you wake, a sunray hits your face
Smeared makeup as we lay in the wake of destruction
Hush baby, speak softly, tell me you're awfully sorry
That you pushed me into the coffee table last night so I can push you off me
Try and touch me so I can scream at you not to touch me
Run out the room and Ill follow you like a lost puppy
Baby, without you, Im nothing, Im so lost, hug me
Then tell me how ugly I am, but that youll always love me
Then after that, shove me, in the aftermath of the
Destructive path that were on, two psychopaths but we
Know that no matter how many knives we put in each others backs
That well have each others backs, cause were that lucky
Together, we move mountains, lets not make mountains out of molehills
You hit me twice, yeah, but whos counting?
I may have hit you three times, Im starting to lose count
But together, well live forever, we found the youth fountain
Our love is crazy, were nuts, but I refused counseling
This house is too huge, if you move out Ill burn all two thousand
Square feet of it to the ground, aint shit you can do about it
'Cause with you Im in my fucking mind, without you, Im out it

[Chorus: Rihanna]
Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
But thats all right because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
But thats all right because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
We the cause of all the commotion
Your mouth running, but where is you going?
What is you smoking, man? That ain't potent
What is you talking, man? That ain't important
Illuminati, High society
We in this party and nobody invited me
We going crazy and I always use my best sense
But it don't matter cause I stay on my fresh prince
Maxin', relaxin, shootin' some pool and
Playing some b-ball outside of the school and
Girls with they top off outside of the pool and
Whips with the drop off outside of the Louvre
You just look stupid to be ignoring
The Delorean parked in front of Armani emporium
And parties at Richie is getting risky
Victoria's Secret show, they miss me
Voices in my head, I need choices in my bed
AHHHHH, get out my fucking head
It's just me and my bad bitch
So you can say I'm on my Brad Pitt
Back to the la familia I'm aligned with
Before I betray them I slit my wrists
At the top is just us nigga
Cause I don't really trust niggas
And we made it through the hurricane
So celebrate and light the Mary Jane
We gon' make it, that's on everything
Truest girls get half naked, every spring
They saying, "Hey Kanye
We need you to go deeper than Tay Zonday,"
Cause my verses got pain, Chocolate Rain
So many lines, you photograph and it make arms break
On the radio, man I miss myself
I need to just step back and kiss myself
Baby, just step up and kiss the belt
A little lower.. that's what's up
Somebody pour her another cup
Is it too much to ask you keep your diamonds up?
I swear until my time is up
My style is sex in the shower, fresh as fuck

[Hook: Rihanna]
So shine bright tonight you and I
We're beautiful like diamonds in the sky
Eye to eye so alive
We're beautiful like diamonds in the sky

[Post-Hook: Rihanna]
Shine bright like a diamond
Shine bright like a diamond
Shining bright like a diamond
We're beautiful like diamonds in the sky
Shine bright like a diamond
Shine bright like a diamond
Shining bright like a diamond
We're beautiful like diamonds in the sky

[Verse 2: Rihanna]
Palms rise to the universe
As we moonshine and molly
Feel the warmth we'll never die
We're like diamonds in the sky
You're a shooting star I see
A vision of ecstasy
When you hold me I'm alive
We're like diamonds in the sky

[Pre-Hook: Rihanna]
I knew that we'd become one right away
Oh right away
At first sight I felt energy of sun rays
I saw the life inside your eyes

[Hook: Rihanna]
So shine bright tonight you and I
We're beautiful like diamonds in the sky
Eye to eye so alive
We're beautiful like diamonds in the sky

[Post-Hook: Rihanna]
Shine bright like a diamond

[Verse 1]
Nothing but a tear, that's all for breakfast
Watching you pretend you're unaffected
You're pulling our connections, expecting me to let you go
But I won't

[Pre-Chorus]
I know you don't need my protection
But I'm in love, can't blame me for checking
I love in your direction, hoping that the message goes

[Chorus]
Somewhere close to you
Close to you
Like so close if they hurt you, you wouldn't find out
Just say now, I'm coming right now to be close to you

[Verse 2]
Said you let it go, you kept it
Working hard to perfect it
But now your fear is reckless, and it's out of your control
Well just let it go

[Pre-Chorus]
I know you don't need my protection
But I'm in love, can't blame me for checking
I love in your direction, hoping that the message goes

[Chorus]
Somewhere close to you
Close to you
Like so close, if they hurt you, you wouldn't find out
If you let me, I'd be there by now
Close to you

Cause the scars on your heart are still mine

Too bad she's just eating off your dreams
Let me know when you're ready to bleed

Sak pas!

[Verse 1]
I didn't mean to end his life
I know it wasn't right
I can't even sleep at night
Can't get it off my mind
I need to get out of sight
'fore I end up behind bars
What started out as a simple altercation
Turned into a real sticky situation
Me just thinking on the time that I'm facing makes me wanna cry

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause I didn't mean to hurt him
Coulda been somebody's son
And I took his heart when I pulled out that gun
Rum-pum-pum-pum, rum-pum-pum-pum, rum-pum-pum-pum
Man down
Rum-pum-pum-pum, rum-pum-pum-pum, rum-pum-pum-pum
Man down

[Chorus]
Oh, mama, mama, mama, I just shot a man down
In central station
In front of a big ol' crowd
Oh, why?
Oh, why?
Oh, mama, mama, mama, I just shot a man down
In central station

[Verse 2]
It's a twenty-two, I call her Peggy Sue
When she fits right down in my shoes
Whatchu expect me to do if you're playing me for a fool?
I will lose my cool and reach for my firearm
I didn't mean to lay him down
But it's too late to turn back now
Don't know what I was thinking
Now he's no longer living
So I'm 'bout to leave town, aye-uh

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause I didn't mean to hurt him
Coulda been somebody's son
And I took his heart when I pulled out that gun
Rum-pum-pum-pum, rum-pum-pum-pum, rum-pum-pum-pum
Man down
Rum-pum-pum-pum, rum-pum-pum-pum, rum-pum-pum-pum
Man down

[Chorus]
Oh, mama, mama, mama, I just shot a man down

[Bridge]
Look, I'd never thought I'd do it
Never thought I'd do it
Never thought I'd do it
Oh gosh, whatever happened to me, ever happened to me, ever happened to me?
Why did I pull the trigger, pull the trigger, pull the trigger
Boom!
And end a nigga, end a nigga life so soon?
When mi pull the trigger, pull the trigger, pull it pon' you
Somebody tell me what I'm gonna, what I'm gonna do?
Eh, rum-pum-pum-pum, rum-pum-pum-pum, rum-pum-pum-pum
Mi say wah man down

Rum-pum-pum-pum, rum-pum-pum-pum, rum-pum-pum-pum

Blowing out your candles, let me make a couple wishes, ah

[Verse 4: Rihanna]
Remember how you did it?
Remember how you ht it?
If you still wanna kiss it
Come, come, come and get it
Sweeter than a rice cake
Cake worth sipping
Kill it, tip it, cake, fill it
If you sexy and you know it
And you ain't afraid to show it
Put a candle on my ma'fuckin' back
Baby, blow it
Love the way you do when you do it like that
Show up with the stacks
Raining racks on my rack
Wrap it up, wrap it up
Boy, while I take this bow off
Talk that talk
Yeah, I know I'm such a show off
Daddy, make a wish
Put this cake in your face
Hahaha, and it's not even my birthday
Ow!

Get it, ooh, it's not even her birthday

[Intro]
Ooh
Oh

[Verse 1]
Ghost in the mirror
I knew your face once, but now it's unclear
And I can't feel my body now
I separate from here and now

[Break]
Ooh
Oh

[Verse 2]
A drug and a dream
A lost connection, oh, come back to me
So I can feel alive again
As soul and body try to mend

[Chorus]
It's pulling me apart, this time
Everything is never-ending
I slipped into a parallel
They'll never understand
This feeling always gets away
Wishing I could hold on longer
Why does it have to feel so strange
To be in love again, be in love again, be in love again?

[Verse 3]
Ghost in the mirror
I knew your face once, but now it's unclear
And I can't feel my body now
I separate from here and now

[Break]
Ooh
Ooh
Ooh
Ooh

It's pulling me apart, this time
Everything is never-ending
I slipped into a parallel
They'll never understand
This feeling always gets away

Why does it have to feel so strange
To be in love again, be in love again, be in love again?

[Verse 1]
I've been ignoring this big lump in my throat
I shouldn't be crying
Tears were for the weaker days
I'm stronger now, or so I say
But something's missing

[Pre-Chorus]
Whatever it is
It feels like it's laughing at me through the glass of a two-sided mirror
Whatever it is
It's just laughing at me
And I just wanna scream

[Chorus]
What now?
I just can't figure it out
What now?
I guess I'll just wait it out 
What now? Oh-oh-oh-ohh
What now?

[Verse 2]
I found the one
He changed my life
But was it me that changed
And he just happened to come at the right time
I'm supposed to be in love, but I'm numb again

[Pre-Chorus]
Whatever it is
It feels like it's laughing at me through the glass of a two-sided mirror
Whatever it is
It's just sitting there laughing at me
And I just wanna scream

[Chorus]
What now?
I just can't figure it out
What now?
I guess I'll just wait it out 
What now? 
What now?

[Bridge]
There's no one to call, 'cause I'm just playing games with them all
But the more I swear I'm happy, the more that I'm feeling alone
'Cause I spend every hour just going through the motions
I can't even get the emotions to come out
Dry as a bone, but I just wanna shout

[Chorus]
What now?
I just can't figure it out
What now?
I guess I'll just wait it out 
What now? 
What now?

[Outro]
I don't know where to go
I don't know what to feel
I don't know how to cry
I don't know, oh-oh, why
I don't know where to go
I don't know what to feel
I don't know how to cry
I don't know, oh-oh, why
I don't know where to go
I don't know what to feel
I don't know how to cry
I don't know, oh-oh, why
So what now?

Love is great, love is fine

[Verse 1: Rihanna]
Yellow diamonds in the light
And we're standing side by side
As your shadow crosses mine
What it takes to come alive

[Pre-Chorus: Rihanna]
It's the way I'm feeling, I just can't deny
But I've gotta let it go

[Chorus: Rihanna]
We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place

[Verse 2: Rihanna]
Shine a light through an open door
Love and life, I will divide
Turn away cause I need you more
Feel the heartbeat in my mind

[Pre-Chorus: Rihanna]
It's the way I'm feeling, I just can't deny
But I've gotta let it go

[Chorus: Rihanna]
We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place

[Intro]
Oh, how about a round of applause?
Yeah, a standing ovation
Oh wow, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse 1]
You look so dumb right now
Standing outside my house
Trying to apologize
You're so ugly when you cry
Please, just cut it out

[Pre-Chorus]
And don't tell me you're sorry 'cause you're not
Baby, when I know you're only sorry you got caught

[Chorus]
But you put on quite a show 
Really had me going
But now it's time to go 
Curtain's finally closing
That was quite a show 
Very entertaining
But it's over now 
Go on and take a bow

[Verse 2]
Grab your clothes and get gone 
You better hurry up
Before the sprinklers come on 
Talking' bout' "Girl, I love you, you're the one"
This just looks like the re-run
Please, what else is on? 

[Pre-Chorus]
And don't tell me you're sorry 'cause you're not
Baby, when I know you're only sorry you got caught

[Chorus]
But you put on quite a show 
Really had me going
But now it's time to go 
Curtain's finally closing
That was quite a show 
Very entertaining
But it's over now 
Go on and take a bow

[Bridge]
Oh, and the award for the best liar goes to you 
For making me believe
That you could be faithful to me
Let's hear your speech, oh
How 'bout a round of applause?
A standing ovation

[Chorus]
But you put on quite a show 
Really had me going
Now it's time to go 
Curtain's finally closing
That was quite a show 
Very entertaining
But it's over now 
Go on and take a bow
But it's over now

[Verse 1]
Story of my life
Searching for the right, but it keeps avoiding me
Sorrow in my soul, 'cause it seems that wrong
Really loves my company
He's more than a man, and this is more than love
The reason that the sky is blue
The clouds are rolling in, because I'm gone again
And to him, I just can't be true

[Pre-Chorus]
And I know that he knows I'm unfaithful
And it kills him inside
To know that I am happy with some other guy
I can see him dying

[Chorus]
I don't wanna do this anymore
I don't wanna be the reason why
Every time I walk out the door
I see him die a little more inside
I don't wanna hurt him anymore
I don't wanna take away his life
I don't wanna be a murderer

[Verse 2]
I feel it in the air as I'm doin' my hair
Preparing for another date
A kiss upon my cheek
As he reluctantly asks if I'm gonna be out late
I say I won't be long, just hanging with the girls
A lie I didn't have to tell
Because we both know where I'm about to go
And we know it very well

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause I know that he knows I'm unfaithful
And it kills him inside
To know that I am happy with some other guy
I can see him dying

[Chorus]
I don't wanna do this anymore
I don't wanna be the reason why
Every time I walk out the door
I see him die a little more inside
I don't wanna hurt him anymore
I don't wanna take away his life
I don't wanna be a murderer

[Bridge]
Our love, his trust
I might as well take a gun and put it to his head
Get it over with
I don't wanna do this anymore
Whoa
Anymore

[Chorus]
I don't wanna do this anymore
I don't wanna be the reason why
And every time I walk out the door
I see him die a little more inside
And I don't wanna hurt him anymore
I don't wanna take away his life
I don't wanna be, a murderer

[Outro]
A murderer, no, no, no
Yeah[Produced by Carlos McKinney, Kuk Harrell and Terius The-Dream Nash]

Part I: Love Without Tragedy

[Refrain]
Red lipstick, rose petals, heartbreak
I was his Marilyn Monroe
Brown eyes, tuxedo, fast cars
A James Dean on the low
Dean on the low

[Verse]
I ask you, "What's the matter?"
You say "Oh, it's nothing at all."
Heart's racing outta control
And you knew that I couldn't let it go
You used to be this boy I loved
And I used to be this girl of your dreams
Who knew the course of this one drive injured us fatally?
You took the best years of my life
I took the best years of your life
Felt like love struck me in the night
I prayed that love don't strike twice

[Refrain]
Red lipstick, rose petals, heartbreak
I was his Marilyn Monroe
Brown eyes, tuxedo, fast cars
A James Dean on the low

[Chorus]
What's love without tragedy?
What's love without tragedy?

What's love without tragedy?
What's love without tragedy?

I'm the butt police and I'm lookin' at your rear, rear, rear
But odds are I'ma end up in the back of a squad car
By the end of tonight, I'm a rock star
Get your wind up, it's attack of the oddball

'Cause I'm sick of sniffin' asphalt
Every thought scarred got my pants off at the crosswalk
In suspenders and I can't feel my lips 'cause

[Verse 1: Rihanna]
Baby, baby, when we first met
I never felt something so strong
You were like my lover and my best friend
All wrapped into one, with a ribbon on it
And all of a sudden, you went and left
I didn't know how to follow
It's like a shot that spun me around and now my heart left
I feel so empty and hollow

[Pre-Chorus: Rihanna]
And I'll never give myself to another the way I gave it to you
Don't even recognize the ways you hurt me, do you?
It's gonna take a miracle to bring me back
And you're the one to blame

[Chorus: Rihanna]
And now I feel like, oh, you're the reason why I'm thinking
I don't wanna smoke on these cigarettes no more
I guess that's what I get for wishful thinking
I should've never let you enter my door
Next time you wanna go on and leave
I should just let you go on and do it 
'Cause now I'm using like I bleed

[Post-Chorus: Rihanna]
It's like I checked into rehab
Baby, you're my disease
It's like I checked into rehab
Baby, you're my disease
I gotta check into rehab
'Cause baby, you're my disease
I gotta check into rehab
'Cause baby, you're my disease

[Verse 2: Rihanna]
Damn, ain't it crazy when you're love swept?
You'll do anything for the one you love
'Cause anytime that you needed me, I'd be there
It's like you were my favorite drug
The only problem is that you was using me
In a different way that I was using you
But now that I know it's not meant to be
You gotta go, I gotta wean myself off of you

[Pre-Chorus: Rihanna]
And I'll never give myself to another the way I gave it to you
Don't even recognize the ways you hurt me, do you?
It's gonna take a miracle to bring me back
And you're the one to blame

[Chorus: Rihanna]
'Cause now I feel like, oh, you're the reason why I'm thinking
I don't wanna smoke on these cigarettes no more
I guess that's what I get for wishful thinking
I should've never let you enter my door 
Next time you wanna go on and leave
I should just let you go on and do it 
'Cause now I'm using like I bleed 

[Post-Chorus: Rihanna]
It's like I checked into rehab 
Baby, you're my disease 
It's like I checked into rehab
Baby, you're my disease
I gotta check into rehab 
'Cause baby, you're my disease 
I gotta check into rehab
'Cause baby, you're my disease

It's like I checked into rehab
Baby, you're my disease

'Cause baby, you're my disease
I gotta check into rehab
'Cause baby, you're my disease

[Verse 1]
Tell me that you love me, when you know you don't love me
But I guess, I guess, I guess it's all good
You can play the game, I'ma still do my thing
Ain't no better way for it to be put
When you fuck them other girls
I bet they be wondering why you always call my name
You think I'm gonna wait around, I ain't got all day

[Pre-Chorus]
You don't need another lover
Don't you let it go
I already got it covered
Let the others know

If you want it, let's do it

Put it in your face, but you acting all scared
Like you can't recognize a good thing
Now that you got a chance, tell me, what it's gon' be?

You can come inside 
And when you enter, you ain't leaving
Be my prisoner for the night, ooh

[Chorus]
Want you to make me feel like I'm the only girl in the world
Like I'm the only one that you'll ever love
Like I'm the only one who knows your heart
Only girl in the world
Like I'm the only one that's in command
'Cause I'm the only one who understands
Like I'm the only one who knows your heart
Only one

[Bridge]
Take me for a ride, ride
Oh, baby, take me high, high
Let me make you rise, rise
Oh, make it last all night, night
Take me for a ride, ride
Oh, baby, take me high, high
Let me make you rise, rise
Make it last all night

[Chorus]
Want you to make me feel like I'm the only girl in the world
Like I'm the only one that you'll ever love
Like I'm the only one who knows your heart
Only girl in the world
Like I'm the only one that's in command
'Cause I'm the only one who understands
How to make you feel like a man
Only girl in the world
Girl in the world
Only girl in the world
Girl in the world

[Verse 1]
I hit a wall, I never felt so low, so low
Like a waterfall, my tears dropped to the floor, the floor
They left a swimming pool of salted crimes, crimes
Oh, what could I do to change your mind?
Nothing

[Pre-Chorus 1]
I'm bracing for the pain and I am letting go
I'm using all my strength to get out of this hole

[Chorus]
I hit a wall, I thought that I would hurt myself
Oh I was sure, your words would leave me unconscious
And on the floor I'd be lying cold, lifeless
But I hit a wall, I hit 'em all, watch the fall
You're just another brick and I'm a sledgehammer
You're just another brick and I'm a sledgehammer

[Verse 2]
Yeah I hit a wall, I prayed that I would make it through, make it through
I can survive a life that's without you, that's without you, yeah
And I will rise up from the ashes now, the ashes now
Oh, the sparrow flies with just the crumbs of loving spilled, yeah

[Pre-Chorus 2]
I was bracing for the pain and then I let it go
I gathered all my strength and I found myself whole

[Chorus]
I hit a wall, I thought that I would hurt myself
Oh I was sure, your words would leave me unconscious
And on the floor I'd be lying cold, lifeless
But I hit a wall, I hit 'em all, watch the fall
You're just another brick and I'm a sledgehammer
You're just another brick and I'm a sledgehammer
You're just another brick and I'm a sledgehammer
You're just another brick and I'm a sledgehammer

[Verse 1]
The mood is set 
So you already know what's next 
TV on blast, turn it down, turn it down
Don't want it to clash
With my body screaming out 
I know you hearin' it 
You got me moanin' now

[Pre-Chorus]
I got a secret that I wanna show you, oh
I got a secret so, I'mma drop em to the floor, oh
No teasin', you waited long enough
Go deep, I'mma throw it at you
Can you catch it? Don't hold back
You know I like it rough
Know I'm feelin' you, huh
Know you liking it, huh

[Chorus]
So why you standin' over there witcha clothes on?
Baby, strip down for me, go on, take 'em off
Don't worry, baby, I'mma meet you halfway
'Cause I know you wanna see me

[Verse 2]
Almost there 
So baby don't stop what you're doing 
Softer than a mutha, boy, I know you wanna touch
Breathing down my neck, I can tell you wanna 
And now you want it like 
Want you to feel it now

[Pre-Chorus]
I got a secret that I wanna show you, ooh
I got a secret so, I'mma drop em to the floor, oh
No teasin', you waited long enough
Go deep, I'mma throw it at you
Can you catch it? Don't hold back
You know I like it rough
Know I'm feelin' you, huh
Know you liking it, huh

[Chorus]
So why you standin' over there witcha clothes on?
Baby, strip down for me, go on, take 'em off
Don't worry, baby, I'mma meet you halfway
'Cause I know you wanna see me

[Chorus 2]
No heels, no shirt, no skirt, all I'm in is just skin
No jeans, take 'em off, wanna feel your skin
You a beast, oh, you know that I like that skin
Come here baby, all I wanna see you in is just skin
O-o-oh, oh, oh, oh your skin
O-o-oh, oh, oh, oh just skin
O-o-oh, oh, oh, oh, I'm lovin' your skin
Oh, oh

[Bridge]
All in, baby, don't hold nothing back
Wanna take control, ain't nothing wrong with that
Say you likin' how I'm feelin', gotta tell me that
Just put your skin, baby on my skin

[Chorus 2]
No heels, no shirt, no skirt, all I'm in is just skin
No jeans, take 'em off, wanna feel your skin
You a beast, oh, you know that I like that skin
Come here baby, all I wanna see you in is just skin
O-o-oh, oh, oh, oh your skin
O-o-oh, oh, oh, oh just skin
O-o-oh, oh, oh, oh, I'm lovin' your skin

No jeans, take 'em off, wanna feel your skin
You a beast, oh, you know that I like that skin
Come here baby, all I wanna see you in is just skin

[Outro]
All I wanna see you in is just skin
All I wanna see you in is just skin
Oooh
All I wanna see you in
All I wanna see you in is your skin, oh

[Verse 1]
Hello, it's me
I was wondering if after all these years you'd like to meet
To go over everything
They say that time's supposed to heal ya, but I ain't done much healing
Hello, can you hear me?
I'm in California dreaming about who we used to be
When we were younger and free
I've forgotten how it felt before the world fell at our feet

[Pre-Chorus]
There's such a difference between us
And a million miles

[Chorus]
Hello from the other side
I must've called a thousand times
To tell you I'm sorry for everything that I've done
But when I call, you never seem to be home
Hello from the outside
At least, I can say that I've tried
To tell you I'm sorry for breaking your heart
But it don't matter, it clearly doesn't tear you apart anymore

[Verse 2]
Hello, how are you?
It's so typical of me to talk about myself, I'm sorry
I hope that you're well
Did you ever make it out of that town where nothing ever happened?

[Pre-Chorus]
It's no secret that the both of us
Are running out of time

[Chorus]
So hello from the other side
I must've called a thousand times
To tell you I'm sorry for everything that I've done
But when I call, you never seem to be home
Hello from the outside
At least, I can say that I've tried
To tell you I'm sorry for breaking your heart
But it don't matter, it clearly doesn't tear you apart anymore

[Bridge]

Ooh, anymore

Ooh, anymore

Ooh, anymore

Anymore

[Chorus]
Hello from the other side
I must've called a thousand times
To tell you I'm sorry for everything that I've done
But when I call, you never seem to be home
Hello from the outside
At least, I can say that I've tried
To tell you I'm sorry for breaking your heart
But it don't matter, it clearly doesn't tear you apart anymore

[Verse 1]
I heard that you're settled down
That you found a girl and you're married now
I heard that your dreams came true
Guess she gave you things I didn't give to you
Old friend, why are you so shy?
Ain't like you to hold back or hide from the light

[Pre-Chorus]
I hate to turn up out of the blue, uninvited
But I couldn't stay away, I couldn't fight it
I had hoped you'd see my face
And that you'd be reminded that for me, it isn't over

[Chorus]
Never mind, I'll find someone like you
I wish nothing but the best for you, too
"Don't forget me," I beg
I'll remember, you said
"Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead."
"Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead."

[Verse 2]
You know how the time flies
Only yesterday was the time of our lives
We were born and raised in a summer haze
Bound by the surprise of our glory days

[Pre-Chorus]
I hate to turn up out of the blue, uninvited
But I couldn't stay away, I couldn't fight it
I had hoped you'd see my face
And that you'd be reminded that for me, it isn't over

[Chorus]
Never mind, I'll find someone like you
I wish nothing but the best for you, too
"Don't forget me," I beg
I'll remember, you said
"Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead."

[Bridge]
Nothing compares, no worries or cares
Regrets and mistakes, they're memories made
Who would have known how bittersweet this would taste?

[Breakdown]
Never mind, I'll find someone like you
I wish nothing but the best for you
"Don't forget me," I beg
I'll remember, you said
"Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead."

[Chorus]
Never mind, I'll find someone like you
I wish nothing but the best for you, too
"Don't forget me," I beg
I'll remember, you said
"Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead."
"Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead."

[Verse 1]
Everybody loves the things you do
From the way you talk to the way you move
Everybody here is watching you
'Cause you feel like home, you're like a dream come true
But if by chance you're here alone
Can I have a moment before I go?
'Cause I've been by myself all night long
Hoping you're someone I used to know

[Pre-Chorus]
You look like a movie
You sound like a song
My God, this reminds me
Of when we were young

[Chorus]
Let me photograph you in this light
In case it is the last time that we might
Be exactly like we were before we realised
We were sad of getting old, it made us restless
It was just like a movie
It was just like a song

[Verse 2]
I was so scared to face my fears
Nobody told me that you'd be here
And I swear you'd moved overseas
That's what you said when you left me

[Pre-Chorus]
You still look like a movie
You still sound like a song
My God, this reminds me
Of when we were young

[Chorus]
Let me photograph you in this light
In case it is the last time that we might
Be exactly like we were before we realised
We were sad of getting old, it made us restless
It was just like a movie
It was just like a song

[Refrain]





[Bridge]
It's hard to admit that everything just takes me back
To when you were there, to when you were there
And a part of me keeps holding on just in case it hasn't gone
'Cause I still care, do you still care?

[Breakdown]
It was just like a movie
It was just like a song
My God, this reminds me
Of when we were young

[Refrain]





[Chorus]
Let me photograph you in this light
In case it is the last time that we might
Be exactly like we were before we realised
We were sad of getting old, it made us restless
Oh, I'm so mad I'm getting old, it makes me reckless
It was just like a movie
It was just like a song
When we were young

[Verse 1]
I will leave my heart at the door
I won't say a word
They've all been said before, you know
So why don't we just play pretend
Like we're not scared of what is coming next
Or scared of having nothing left?

[Pre-Chorus]
Look, don't get me wrong
I know there is no tomorrow
All I ask is

[Chorus]
If this is my last night with you
Hold me like I'm more than just a friend
Give me a memory I can use
Take me by the hand while we do
What lovers do
It matters how this ends
'Cause what if I never love again?

[Verse 2]
I don't need your honesty
It's already in your eyes
And I'm sure my eyes, they speak for me
No one knows me like you do
And since you're the only one that mattered
Tell me, who do I run to?

[Pre-Chorus]
Look, don't get me wrong
I know there is no tomorrow
All I ask is

[Chorus]
If this is my last night with you
Hold me like I'm more than just a friend
Give me a memory I can use
Take me by the hand while we do
What lovers do
It matters how this ends
'Cause what if I never love again?

[Bridge]
Let this be our lesson in love
Let this be the way we remember us
I don't want to be cruel or vicious
And I ain't asking for forgiveness
All I ask is

[Chorus]
If this is my last night with you
Hold me like I'm more than just a friend
Give me a memory I can use
Take me by the hand while we do
What lovers do
It matters how this ends
'Cause what if I never love again?

[Verse 1]
There's a fire starting in my heart
Reaching a fever pitch, and it's bringing me out the dark
Finally, I can see you crystal clear
Go ahead and sell me out, and then I'll lay your shit bare
See how I'll leave with every piece of you
Don't underestimate the things that I will do
There's a fire starting in my heart
Reaching a fever pitch, and it's bringing me out the dark

[Pre-Chorus]
The scars of your love remind me of us
They keep me thinkin' that we almost had it all
The scars of your love, they leave me breathless
I can't help feeling

[Chorus]
We could have had it all

Rolling in the deep

You had my heart inside of your hand

And you played it to the beat


[Verse 2]
Baby, I have no story to be told
But I've heard one on you, now I'm gonna make your head burn
Think of me in the depths of your despair
Make a home down there, as mine sure won't be shared

[Pre-Chorus]

The scars of your love remind me of us

They keep me thinkin' that we almost had it all

The scars of your love, they leave me breathless

I can't help feeling

[Chorus]
We could have had it all

Rolling in the deep

You had my heart inside of your hand

And you played it to the beat

Could have had it all
Rolling in the deep
You had my heart inside of your hand
But you played it with a beating

[Verse 3]
Throw your soul through every open door 
Count your blessings to find what you look for 
Turn my sorrow into treasured gold 
You'll pay me back in kind and reap just what you sow

[Breakdown]

We could have had it all

We could have had it all

It all, it all, it all


[Chorus]
We could have had it all

Rolling in the deep

You had my heart inside of your hand

And you played it to the beat

We could have had it all

Rolling in the deep

You had my heart inside of your hand

But you played it, you played it, you played it
You played it to the beat

[Intro]
Just the guitar?
Okay, cool

[Verse 1]
This was all you, none of it me
You put your hands on, on my body and told me
Mmm, told me you were ready
For the big one, for the big jump
I'd be your last love, everlasting, you and me
Mmm, that was what you told me

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm giving you up
I've forgiven it all
You set me free

[Chorus]
Send my love to your new lover
Treat her better
We've gotta let go of all of our ghosts
We both know we ain't kids no more
Send my love to your new lover
Treat her better
We've gotta let go of all of our ghosts
We both know we ain't kids no more

[Verse 2]
I was too strong, you were trembling
You couldn't handle the hot heat rising 
Mmm, baby, I'm still rising
I was running, you were walking
You couldn't keep up, you were falling down 
Mmm, there's only one way down

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm giving you up
I've forgiven it all
You set me free, oh

[Chorus]
Send my love to your new lover
Treat her better
We've gotta let go of all of our ghosts
We both know we ain't kids no more
Send my love to your new lover
Treat her better
We've gotta let go of all of our ghosts
We both know we ain't kids no more

[Bridge]
If you're ready, if you're ready
If you're ready, I am ready
If you're ready, if you're ready
We both know we ain't kids no more
No, we ain't kids no more

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm giving you up
I've forgiven it all
You set me free

[Chorus]
Send my love to your new lover
Treat her better
We've gotta let go of all of our ghosts
We both know we ain't kids no more
Send my love to your new lover
Treat her better
We've gotta let go of all of our ghosts
We both know we ain't kids no more

[Outro]
If you're ready, if you're ready

If you're ready, are you ready?

We've gotta let go of all of our ghosts
We both know we ain't kids no more
If you're ready, if you're ready

If you're ready, are you ready?

We've gotta let go of all of our ghosts
We both know we ain't kids no more[Produced by Fraser T Smith]

[Verse 1]
I let it fall, my heart
And as it fell, you rose to claim it
It was dark, and I was over
Until you kissed my lips and you saved me
My hands, they were strong
But my knees were far too weak
To stand in your arms
Without falling to your feet

[Pre-Chorus]
But there's a side to you
That I never knew, never knew
All the things you'd say
They were never true, never true
And the games you'd play
You would always win, always win

[Chorus]
But I set fire to the rain
Watched it pour as I touched your face
Well, it burned while I cried
'Cause I heard it screaming out your name
Your name

[Verse 2]
When I lay with you
I could stay there, close my eyes
Feel you here forever
You and me together, nothing is better

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause there's a side to you
That I never knew, never knew
All the things you'd say
They were never true, never true
And the games you'd play
You would always win, always win

[Chorus]
But I set fire to the rain
Watched it pour as I touched your face
Well, it burned while I cried
'Cause I heard it screaming out your name
Your name

I set fire to the rain
And I threw us into the flames
When it fell, something died
'Cause I knew that that was the last time
The last time

[Bridge]
Sometimes, I wake up by the door
That heart you caught must be waiting for you
Even now, when we're already over
I can't help myself from looking for you

[Chorus]
I set fire to the rain
Watched it pour as I touched your face
Well, it burned while I cried
'Cause I heard it screaming out your name
Your name

I set fire to the rain
And I threw us into the flames
When it fell, something died
'Cause I knew that that was the last time
The last time

[Outro]
Oh, oh, no
Let it burn
Oh, oh, oh
Let it burn
Let it burn

[Verse 1]
If you're not the one for me
Then how come I can bring you to your knees?
If you're not the one for me
Why do I hate the idea of being free?
And if I'm not the one for you
You've gotta stop holding me the way you do
Oh honey, if Im not the one for you
Why have we been through what we have been through?

[Pre-Chorus]
It's so cold out here in your wilderness
I want you to be my keeper
But not if you are so reckless

[Chorus]
If you're gonna let me down, let me down gently
Don't pretend that you don't want me
Our love ain't water under the bridge
If you're gonna let me down, let me down gently
Don't pretend that you don't want me
Our love ain't water under the bridge
Say that our love ain't water under the bridge

[Verse 2]
What are you waiting for?
You never seem to make it through the door
And who are you hiding from?
It ain't no life to live like you're on the run
Have I ever asked for much?
The only thing that I want is your love

[Chorus]
If you're gonna let me down, let me down gently
Don't pretend that you don't want me
Our love ain't water under the bridge
If you're gonna let me down, let me down gently
Don't pretend that you don't want me
Our love ain't water under the bridge
Say that our love ain't water under the bridge

[Pre-Chorus]
It's so cold in your wilderness
I want you to be my keeper
But not if you are so reckless

[Chorus]
If you're gonna let me down, let me down gently
Don't pretend that you don't want me
Our love ain't water under the bridge
If you're gonna let me down, let me down gently
Don't pretend that you don't want me
Our love ain't water under the bridge

[Outro]
Say it ain't so, say it ain't so
Say it ain't so, say it ain't so
Say that our love ain't water under the bridge 
Say it ain't so, say it ain't so
Say it ain't so, say it ain't so
Say it ain't so, say it ain't so
Say that our love ain't water under the bridge 
Say it ain't so, say it ain't so
Say that our love ain't water under the bridge

[Verse 1]
When the rain is blowing in your face
And the whole world is on your case
I could offer you a warm embrace
To make you feel my love

[Verse 2]
When the evening shadows and the stars appear
And there is no one there to dry your tears
I could hold you for a million years
To make you feel my love

[Bridge 1]
I know you haven't made your mind up yet
But I will never do you wrong
I've known it from the moment that we met
No doubt in my mind where you belong

[Verse 3]
I'd go hungry, I'd go black and blue and
I'd go crawling down the avenue
No, there's nothing that I wouldn't do
To make you feel my love

[Instrumental break]

[Bridge 2]
The storms are raging on the rollin' sea
And on the highway of regret
The winds of change are blowing wild and free
You ain't seen nothing like me yet

[Verse 4]
I could make you happy, make your dreams come true
Nothing that I wouldn't do
Go to the ends of the earth for you
To make you feel my love
To make you feel my love

[Verse 1]
This is the end
Hold your breath and count to ten
Feel the Earth move, and then
Hear my heart burst again
For this is the end
I've drowned and dreamt this moment
So overdue, I owe them
Swept away, I'm stolen

[Chorus]
Let the sky fall
When it crumbles
We will stand tall
Face it all together
Let the sky fall
When it crumbles
We will stand tall
Face it all together
At Skyfall
At Skyfall

[Verse 2]
Skyfall is where we start
A thousand miles and poles apart
Where worlds collide and days are dark
You may have my number
You can take my name
But you'll never have my heart

[Chorus]
Let the sky fall 
When it crumbles 
We will stand tall 
Face it all together
Let the sky fall 
When it crumbles 
We will stand tall 
Face it all together
At Skyfall
Let the sky fall
When it crumbles
We will stand tall
Let the sky fall
When it crumbles
We will stand tall

[Bridge]
Where you go I go
What you see I see
I know I'd never be me
Without the security
Of your loving arms
Keeping me from harm
Put your hand in my hand
And we'll stand

[Chorus]
Let the sky fall 
When it crumbles 
We will stand tall 
Face it all together
Let the sky fall 
When it crumbles 
We will stand tall 
Face it all together
At Skyfall
Let the sky fall
We will stand tall
At Skyfall

[Verse 1]
I've made up my mind
Don't need to think it over
If I'm wrong, I am right
Don't need to look no further
This ain't lust, I know this is love, but
If I tell the world, I'll never say enough
'Cause it was not said to you
And that's exactly what I need to do if I end up with you

[Chorus]
Should I give up, or should I just keep chasing pavements
Even if it leads nowhere?
Or would it be a waste, even if I knew my place?
Should I leave it there?
Should I give up, or should I just keep chasing pavements
Even if it leads nowhere?

[Verse 2]
I build myself up and fly around in circles
Waiting as my heart drops
And my back begins to tingle
Finally, could this be it, or?

[Chorus]
Should I give up, or should I just keep chasing pavements
Even if it leads nowhere?
Or would it be a waste, even if I knew my place?
Should I leave it there?
Should I give up, or should I just keep chasing pavements
Even if it leads nowhere? Yeah

[Breakdown]
Should I give up, or should I just keep chasing pavements
Even if it leads nowhere?
Or would it be a waste, even if I knew my place?
Should I leave it there?
Should I give up, or should I just keep on chasing pavements?
Should I just keep on chasing pavements?
Oh, oh

[Chorus]
Should I give up, or should I just keep chasing pavements
Even if it leads nowhere?
Or would it be a waste, even if I knew my place?
Should I leave it there?
Should I give up, or should I just keep chasing pavements
Even if it leads nowhere?[Produced by Greg Kurstin]

[Verse 1]
I only wanted to have fun
Learning to fly, learning to run
I let my heart decide the way
When I was young
Deep down, I must have always known
That this would be inevitable
To earn my stripes, I'd have to pay
And bare my soul

[Chorus 1]
I know I'm not the only one
Who regrets the things they've done
Sometimes, I just feel it's only me
Who can't stand the reflection that they see
I wish I could live a little more
Look up to the sky, not just the floor
I feel like my life is flashing by
And all I can do is watch and cry
I miss the air, I miss my friends
I miss my mother, I miss it when
Life was a party to be thrown
But that was a million years ago

[Verse 2]
When I walk around all of the streets
Where I grew up and found my feet
They can't look me in the eye
It's like they're scared of me
I try to think of things to say
Like a joke or a memory
But they don't recognize me now
In the light of day

[Chorus 2]
I know I'm not the only one
Who regrets the things they've done
Sometimes, I just feel it's only me
Who never became who they thought they'd be
I wish I could live a little more
Look up to the sky, not just the floor
I feel like my life is flashing by
And all I can do is watch and cry
I miss the air, I miss my friends
I miss my mother, I miss it when
Life was a party to be thrown
But that was a million years ago

[Outro]
A million years ago

[Verse 1]
I want every single piece of you
I want your heaven and your oceans too
Treat me soft but touch me cruel
I wanna teach you things you never knew, baby
Bring the floor up to my knees
Let me fall into your gravity
Then kiss me back to life to see
Your body standing over me

[Pre-Chorus]
Baby, don't let the lights go down
Baby, don't let the lights go down
Baby, don't let the lights go down
Lights go down, lights go down
Lights go down, lights go down
Down, down, down

[Chorus]
I miss you when the lights go out
It illuminates all of my doubts
Pull me in, hold me tight, don't let go
Baby, give me light
I miss you when the lights go out
It illuminates all of my doubts
Pull me in, hold me tight, don't let go
Baby, give me light

[Verse 2]
I love the way your body moves
Towards me from across the room
Brushing past my every groove
No one has me like you do, baby
Bring your heart, I'll bring my soul
But be delicate with my ego
I wanna step into your great unknown
With you and me setting the tone

[Pre-Chorus]
Baby, don't let the lights go down
Baby, don't let the lights go down
Baby, don't let the lights go down
Lights go down, lights go down
Lights go down, lights go down
Down, down, down

[Chorus]
I miss you when the lights go out
It illuminates all of my doubts
Pull me in, hold me tight, don't let go
Baby, give me light
I miss you when the lights go out
It illuminates all of my doubts
Pull me in, hold me tight, don't let go
Baby, give me light

[Bridge]
We play so dirty in the dark
'Cause we are living worlds apart
It only makes it harder, baby
It only makes it harder, baby
Harder baby, harder baby

[Chorus]
I miss you when the lights go out
It illuminates all of my doubts
Pull me in, hold me tight, don't let go
Baby, give me light
I miss you when the lights go out
It illuminates all of my doubts
Pull me in, hold me tight, don't let go
Baby, give me light

[Outro]
I miss you, I miss you
I miss you, I miss you
I miss you, I miss you
I miss you, I miss you

[Verse 1]
Close enough to start a war
All that I have is on the floor
God only knows what we're fighting for
All that I say, you always say more

[Pre-Chorus]
I can't keep up with your turning tables
Under your thumb, I can't breathe

[Chorus]
So, I won't let you close enough to hurt me
No, I won't rescue you to just desert me
I can't give you the heart you think you gave me
It's time to say goodbye to turning tables
To turning tables

[Verse 2]
Under haunted skies, I see you
Ooh, where love is lost, your ghost is found
I braved a hundred storms to leave you
As hard as you try, no, I will never be knocked down

[Pre-Chorus]
I can't keep up with your turning tables
Under your thumb, I can't breathe

[Chorus]
So, I won't let you close enough to hurt me
No, I won't rescue you to just desert me
I can't give you the heart you think you gave me
It's time to say goodbye to turning tables
Turning tables

[Bridge]
Next time, I'll be braver
I'll be my own savior when the thunder calls for me
Next time, I'll be braver
I'll be my own savior, standing on my own two feet

[Chorus]
I won't let you close enough to hurt me
No, I won't rescue you to just desert me
I can't give you the heart you think you gave me
It's time to say goodbye to turning tables
To turning tables

[Outro]
Turning tables, yeah
Turn, no, no, no-oh

[Verse 1]
Take your eyes off of me so I can leave
I'm far too ashamed to do it with you watching me
This is never ending, we have been here before
But I can't stay this time 'cause I don't love you anymore

Please stay where you are, don't come any closer
Don't try to change my mind, I'm being cruel to be kind

[Chorus]
I can't love you in the dark
It feels like we're oceans apart
There is so much space between us
Baby, we're already defeated
Ah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah everything changed me

[Verse 2]
You have given me something that I can't live without
You mustn't underestimate that when you are in doubt
But I don't want to carry on like everything is fine
The longer we ignore it all the more that we will fight

Please don't fall apart, I can't face your breaking heart
I'm trying to be brave, stop asking me to stay

[Chorus]
I can't love you in the dark
It feels like we're oceans apart
There is so much space between us
Baby, we're already defeated
Ah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah everything changed me

[Bridge]
We're not the only ones
I don't regret a thing
Every word I've said
You know I'll always mean
It is the world to me
That you are in my life
But I want to live and not just survive

[Chorus]
That's why I can't love you in the dark
It feels like we're oceans apart
There is so much space between us
Baby, we're already defeated
'Cause ah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah everything changed me
And I-I-I-I-I don't think you can save me

[Verse 1]
I remember all of the things that I thought I wanted to be
So desperate to find a way out of my world and finally breathe
Right before my eyes I saw my heart, it came to life
This ain't easy, it's not meant to be, every story has its scars

[Chorus]
But when the pain cuts you deep
When the night keeps you from sleeping
Just look and you will see that I will be your remedy
When the world seems so cruel
And your heart makes you feel like a fool
I promise you will see that I will be
I will be your remedy

[Verse 2]
No river is too wide or too deep for me to swim to you
Come whatever, I'll be the shelter that won't let the rain come through
Your love, it is my truth and I will always love you
Love you, oh

[Chorus]
When the pain cuts you deep
When the night keeps you from sleeping
Just look and you will see that I will be your remedy
When the world seems so cruel
And your heart makes you feel like a fool
I promise you will see that I will be
I will be your remedy
Ohhh, ohhh
When the pain cuts you deep
When the night keeps you from sleeping
Just look and you will see I will be, I will be
When the world seems so cruel
And your heart makes you feel like a fool
I promise you will see that I will be, I will be
I will be your remedy
Ohhh, ohhh

[Verse 1]
You've been on my mind
I grow fonder every day
Lose myself in time
Just thinking of your face
God only knows
Why it's taken me so long
To let my doubts go
You're the only one that I want

[Pre-Chorus]
I don't know why I'm scared
I've been here before
Every feeling, every word
I've imagined it all
You'll never know if you never try
To forget your past and simply be mine

[Chorus]
I dare you to let me be your
Your one and only
Promise I'm worthy
To hold in your arms
So come on and give me the chance
To prove I am the one who can
Walk that mile
Until the end starts

[Verse 2]
Have I been on your mind?
You hang on every word I say
Lose yourself in time
At the mention of my name?
Will I ever know
How it feels to hold you close?
And have you tell me
Whichever road I choose, you'll go

[Pre-Chorus]
I don't know why I'm scared
'Cause I've been here before
Every feeling, every word
I've imagined it all
You'll never know if you never try
To forget your past and simply be mine

[Chorus]
I dare you to let me be your
Your one and only
I promise I'm worthy, mmm
To hold in your arms
So come on and give me the chance
To prove I am the one who can
Walk that mile
Until the end starts

[Bridge]
I know it ain't easy giving up your heart
I know it ain't easy giving up your heart

I know it ain't easy giving up your heart

I know it ain't easy giving up your heart

I know it ain't easy giving up your heart

I know it ain't easy giving up your heart

[Chorus]
So, I dare you to let me be your
Your one and only
I promise I'm worthy
To hold in your arms
So come on and give me the chance
To prove I am the one who can
Walk that mile
Until the end starts

[Outro]
Come on and give me the chance
To prove I am the one who can
Walk that mile
Until the end starts

[Verse 1]
When will I see you again?
You left with no goodbye, not a single word was said
No final kiss to seal any seams
I had no idea of the state we were in

[Pre-Chorus]
I know I have a fickle heart and bitterness
And a wandering eye, and a heaviness in my head

[Chorus]
But don't you remember?
Don't you remember?
The reason you loved me before
Baby, please remember me once more

[Verse 2]
When was the last time you thought of me?
Or have you completely erased me from your memory?
I often think about where I went wrong
The more I do, the less I know

[Pre-Chorus]
But I know I have a fickle heart and bitterness
And a wandering eye, and a heaviness in my head

[Chorus]
But don't you remember?
Don't you remember?
The reason you loved me before
Baby, please remember me once more

[Bridge]
Gave you the space so you could breathe
I kept my distance so you would be free
And hope that you find the missing piece
To bring you back to me

[Chorus]
Why don't you remember?
Don't you remember?
The reason you loved me before
Baby, please remember me once more

[Outro]
When will I see you again?

[Intro]
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

[Verse 1]
She, she ain't real
She ain't gon' be able to love you like I will
She is a stranger
You and I have history, or don't you remember?
Sure, she's got it all
But baby, is that really what you want?

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Bless your soul, you've got your head in the clouds
She made a fool out of you
And boy, she's bringing you down
She made your heart melt, but you're cold to the core
Now rumour has it, she ain't got your love anymore

[Chorus]
Rumour has it 
But rumour has it 
But rumour has it 
But rumour has it 
But rumour has it 
But rumour has it 
But rumour has it 
But rumour has it 

[Verse 2]
She is half your age
But I'm guessing that's the reason that you strayed
I heard you've been missing me
You've been telling people things you shouldn't be
Like when we creep out when she ain't around
Haven't you heard the rumours?

[Pre-Chorus 2]

Bless your soul, you've got your head in the clouds
You made a fool out of me
And boy, you're bringing me down
You made my heart melt, yet I'm cold to the core
But rumour has it, I'm the one you're leaving her for

[Chorus]
Rumour has it 
But rumour has it 
But rumour has it 
But rumour has it 
But rumour has it 
But rumour has it 
But rumour has it 
But rumour has it 

[Bridge]
All of these words whispered in my ear
Tell a story that I cannot bear to hear
Just 'cause I said it, it don't mean that I meant it
People say crazy things
Just 'cause I said it, don't mean that I meant it
Just 'cause you heard it

[Chorus]
Rumour has it 
But rumour has it 
But rumour has it 
But rumour has it 
But rumour has it 
But rumour has it 
But rumour has it 
But rumour has it 

[Breakdown]
But rumour has it 
But rumour has it 
But rumour has it 
But rumour has it 
But rumour has it 
But rumour has it 

[Outro]
But rumour has it, he's the one I'm leaving you for

[Verse 1]
I've been walking in the same way as I did
Missing out the cracks in the pavement
And tutting my heel and strutting my feet
"Is there anything I can do for you dear?"
"Is there anyone I could call?"
"No and thank you, please madame
I ain't lost, just wandering"

[Chorus]
Round my hometown
Memories are fresh
Round my hometown
Ooh, the people I've met
Are the wonders of my world
Are the wonders of my world
Are the wonders of this world
Are the wonders now

[Verse 2]
I like it in the city
When the air is so thick and opaque
I love it to see everybody in short skirts, shorts and shades
I like it in the city when two worlds collide
You get the people and the government
Everybody taking different sides

[Refrain]
Shows that we ain't gonna stand shit
Shows that we are united
Shows that we ain't gonna take it
Shows that we ain't gonna stand shit
Shows that we are united

[Chorus]
Round my hometown
Memories are fresh
Round my hometown
Ooh, the people I've met, yeah

[Outro]
Doo-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-dah, yeah
Doo-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-dah, yeah
Doo-doo-doo-doo ooh-ooh yeah
Yeah, yeah-ey
Are the wonders of my world
Are the wonders of my world
Are the wonders of this world
Are the wonders of my world
Of my world
Yeah, of my world
Of my world, yeah

[Verse 1]
Everybody tells me it's 'bout time that I moved on
That I need to learn to lighten up and learn how to be young
But my heart is a valley, it's so shallow and manmade
I'm scared to death if I let you in that you'll see I'm just a fake
Sometimes I feel lonely in the arms of your touch
But I know that's just me 'cause nothing ever is enough
When I was a child I grew up by the River Lea
There was something in the water, now that something's in me

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh I can't go back, but the reeds are growing out of my fingertips
I can't go back to the river

[Chorus]
But it's in my roots, in my veins
In my blood and I stain every heart that I use to heal the pain
Oh it's in my roots, in my veins
In my blood and I stain every heart that I use to heal the pain
So I blame it on the River Lea, the River Lea, the River Lea
Yeah I blame it on the River Lea, the River Lea, the River Lea

[Verse 2]
I should probably tell you now before it's way too late
That I never meant to hurt you or lie straight to your face
Consider this my apology, I know it's years in advance
But I would rather say it now in case I never get the chance

[Pre-Chorus]
No I can't go back, but the reeds are growing out of my fingertips
I can't go back to the river

[Chorus]
But it's in my roots, in my veins
In my blood and I stain every heart that I use to heal the pain
Oh it's in my roots, in my veins
In my blood and I stain every heart that I use to heal the pain
So I blame it on the River Lea, the River Lea, the River Lea
Yeah I blame it on the River Lea, the River Lea, the River Lea
So I blame it on the River Lea, the River Lea, the River Lea
Yeah I blame it on the River Lea, the River Lea, the River Lea

[Outro]
River Lea, River Lea
River Lea
The River Lea-ea-ea
The River Lea-ea-ea
The River Lea-ea-ea

[Intro]

[Verse 1]
With your loving, there ain't nothing that I can't adore
The way I'm running with you, honey
Means we can break every law
I find it funny that you're the only one I never looked for
There is something in your loving that tears down my walls

[Pre-Chorus]
I wasn't ready then, I'm ready now
I'm heading straight for you
You will only be eternally
The one that I belong to

[Chorus]
The sweetest devotion
Hit me like an explosion
All of my life, I've been frozen
The sweetest devotion I know

[Verse 2]
I'll forever be whatever you want me to be
I'll go under and all over for your clarity
When you wonder if I'm gonna lose my way home
Just remember, that come whatever, I'll be yours all along

[Pre-Chorus]
I wasn't ready then, I'm ready now
I'm heading straight for you
You will only be eternally
The one that I belong to

[Chorus]
The sweetest devotion
Hit me like an explosion
All of my life, I've been frozen
The sweetest devotion I know

[Bridge]
I've been looking for you, baby
In every face that I've ever known
And there is something 'bout the way you love me
That finally feels like home
You're my light, you're my darkness
You're the right kind of madness
You're my hope, you're my despair
You're my scope of everything, everywhere

[Chorus]
The sweetest devotion
Hit me like an explosion
All of my life, I've been frozen
The sweetest devotion I know

[Outro]
Sweetest, it's the sweetest
Sweetest, it's the sweetest
Sweetest, it's the sweetest
Sweetest, it's the sweetest devotion

[Verse 1]
When did it go wrong? I will never know
I have loved you all my life
How did it slow down? I go round and around
Thinking about it all the time

[Pre-Chorus]
I gave you heaven on a platter baby
I gave you everything you never gave me
I never lied and I never faked it
Only wanted for you to save me
This love, it ain't over yet
There's too much that I haven't said

[Chorus]
Did you find the note that I wrote?
I hid it in the seam of your coat
It was hard to write with a lump in my throat
Do you even know that I can't let go?

[Verse 2]
Why were you so cold? Let the truth be told
Tell me, was it all for the thrill?
What was I thinking? I gave you everything
But you still went for the kill

[Pre-Chorus]
I gave you heaven on a platter baby
I gave you everything you never gave me
I never lied and I never faked it
Only wanted for you to save me

[Chorus]
Did you find the note that I wrote?
I hid it in the seam of your coat
It was hard to write with a lump in my throat
Do you even know that I can't let go?

[Bridge]
Oooh, sometimes I feel like I'm in the dark
Oooh, I thought I'd die in your arms

[Chorus]
Did you find the note that I wrote?
I hid it in the seam of your coat
It was hard to write, I had a lump in my throat
Do you even know that I can't let go?

[Outro]
Hope you know, I won't let go

[Verse 1]
Some say I'll be better without you
But they don't know you like I do
Or at least the sides I thought I knew
I can't bear this time
It drags on as I lose my mind
Reminded by things I find
Like notes and clothes you left behind
Wake me up, wake me up when all is done
I won't rise until this battle's won
My dignity's become undone

[Chorus 1]
But I won't go
I can't do it on my own
If this ain't love, then what is?
I'm willing to take the risk
I won't go
I can't do it on my own
If this ain't love, then what is?
I'm willing to take the risk

[Verse 2]
So petrified, I'm so scared to step into this ride
What if I lose my heart and fail the climb?
I won't forgive me if I give up trying
I heard his voice today
I didn't know a single word he said
Not one resemblance to the man I met
Just a vague and broken boy instead

[Chorus 1]
But I won't go
I can't do it on my own
If this ain't love, then what is?
I'm willing to take the risk
I won't go
I can't do it on my own
If this ain't love, then what is?
I'm willing to take the risk

[Bridge]
There will be times we'll try and give it up
Bursting at the seams, no doubt
We'll almost fall apart then burn the pieces
To watch them turn to dust
But nothing will ever taint us

[Chorus 1]
I won't go
I can't do it on my own
If this ain't love, then what is?
I'm willing to take the risk
I won't go
I can't do it on my own
If this ain't love, then what is?
I, I'm willing to take the risk

[Verse 3]
Will he, will he still remember me?
Will he still love me even when he's free?
Or will he go back to the place where he will choose the poison over me?
When we spoke yesterday
He said to hold my breath and sit and wait
"I'll be home so soon, I won't be late"

[Chorus 2]
He won't go
He can't do it on his own
If this ain't love, then what is?
He's willing to take the risk
So I won't go
He can't do it on his own
If this ain't love, then what is?
I'm willing to take the risk

[Chorus 3]
'Cause he won't go
He can't do it on his own
If this ain't love, then what is?
We're willing to take the risk
I won't go
I can't do it on my own
If this ain't love, then what is?
I'm willing to take the risk

[Verse 1]
Whenever I'm alone with you
You make me feel like I am home again
Whenever I'm alone with you
You make me feel like I am whole again

[Verse 2]
Whenever I'm alone with you
You make me feel like I am young again
Whenever I'm alone with you
You make me feel like I am fun again

[Chorus]
However far away, I will always love you
However long I stay, I will always love you
Whatever words I say, I will always love you
I will always love you

[Verse 3]
Whenever I'm alone with you
You make me feel like I am free again
Whenever I'm alone with you
You make me feel like I am clean again

[Chorus]
However far away, I will always love you
However long I stay, I will always love you
Whatever words I say, I will always love you
I will always love you
However far away, I will always love you
However long I stay, I will always love you
Whatever words I say, I will always love you
I'll always love you

[Outro]
I'll always love you
'Cause I love you
Love, love

[Verse 1]
Daydreamer
Sitting on the sea
Soaking up the sun
He is a real lover
Of making up the past
And feeling up his girl
Like he's never felt her figure before

[Verse 2]
A jaw dropper
Looks good when he walks
Is the subject of their talk
He would be hard to chase
But good to catch
And he could change the world
With his hands behind his back, oh

[Chorus]
You can find him sitting on your doorstep
Waiting for a surprise
And he will feel like he's been there for hours
And you can tell that he'll be there for life

[Verse 3]
Daydreamer
With eyes that make you melt
He lends his coat for shelter
Plus he's there for you
When he shouldn't be
But he stays all the same
Waits for you
Then sees you through

[Bridge]
There's no way I could describe him
What I've said is just what I'm hoping for

[Chorus]
But I will find him sitting on my doorstep
Waiting for a surprise
And he will feel like he's been there for hours
And I can tell that he'll be there for life
And I can tell that he'll be there for life

[Intro]
Why do you love me, do you love me?
Why do you love me, do you love me?
Why do you love me, do you love me?
Why do you love me?
Why do you love me, do you love me?
Why do you love me, do you love me?
Why do you love me, do you love me?
Why do you love me?

[Verse 1]
Why do you love me?
There must be something in the water
'Cause, baby, I'm in deeper than I knew
How do you keep me coming back for more
After all we've been through?

[Pre-Chorus]
I can't decide if I should run and hide

[Chorus]
It's above and beyond me, it's out of my hands
Your love drives me crazy, it's hard to understand
Just why I want you to love me
I want you to love me
I want you to love me
I want you to love me

[Verse 2]
Who knows why I love you
It could be something in the air I breathe
Whatever it is, I depend on it
And where does the time go?
I spend every single moment daydreaming of you

[Pre-Chorus]
I can't describe how I feel, it feels right

[Chorus]
It's above and beyond me, it's out of my hands
Your love drives me crazy, it's hard to understand
Just why I want you to love me
I want you to love me
I want you to love me
I want you to love me

[Bridge]
You were a shot in the dark that blew me away
And you left your mark, and it never will fade
You've ignited a spark, let the fires away
Are you ready, ready?
You have a place in my heart that will always be yours
You are the peak and art of my universe
Every piece and part, you were the first
I am ready, ready

[Chorus]
It's above and beyond me, it's out of my hands
Your love drives me crazy, it's hard to understand
Just why I want you to love me
I want you to love me
I want you to love me
I want you

[Chorus]
It's above and beyond me, it's out of my hands
Your love drives me crazy, it's hard to understand
Just why I want you to love me
I want you to love me
I want you to love me
I want you to love me

[Outro]
Why do you love me, do you love me?
Why do you love me, do you love me?
Why do you love me, do you love me?
Why do you love me, do you love me?

[Verse 1]
Right under my feet is air made of bricks
That pulls me down and turns me weak for you
I find myself repeating like a broken tune
And I'm forever excusing your intentions
Then, I give in to my pretendings
Which forgive you each time
Without me knowing
They melt my heart to stone

[Chorus 1]
And I hear your words that I made up
You say my name like there could be an us
I best tidy up my head, I'm the only one in love
I'm the only one in love

[Verse 2]
Each and every time I turn around to leave
I feel my heart begin to burst and bleed
So, desperately, I try to link it with my head
But instead, I fall back to my knees
As you tear your way right through me
I forgive you once again
Without me knowing
You've burnt my heart to stone

[Chorus 1]
And I hear your words that I made up
You say my name like there could be an us
I best tidy up my head, I'm the only one in love
I'm the only one in love

[Bridge]
Why do you steal my hand
Whenever I'm standing my own ground?
You build me up and leave me there

[Chorus 2]
Well, I hear your words you made up
I say your name like there should be an us
I best tidy up my head, I'm the only one
In love, I'm the only one in love

[Verse 1]
Didn't I give it all? Tried my best
Gave you everything I had, everything and no less
Didn't I do it right? Did I let you down?
Maybe you got too used to, well having me around
Still how can you walk away from all my tears?
Its gonna be an empty road without me right here

[Chorus]
But go on and take it
Take it all with you
Don't look back at this crumbling fool
Just take it all with my love
Take it all with my love

[Verse 2]
Maybe I should leave to help you see
Nothing gets better than this
And this is everything we need
So is it over? Is this really it?
You're giving up so easily
I thought you loved me more than this

[Chorus]
But go on, go on and take it
Take it all with you
Don't look back at this crumbling fool
Just take it all with my love
Take it all with my love

[Bridge]
I will change if I must
Slow it down and bring it home, I will adjust
Oh if only, if only you knew
Everything I do is for you

[Chorus]
But go on, go on and take it
Take it all with you
Don't look back at this crumbling fool
Just take it
Take it all with you
Don't look back at this crumbling fool
Just take it all with my love
Take it all with my love
Take it all with my love

[Verse 1]
I would never lie to you unless you tell me to
Every part of me, all my words to hold
And hold against me, why won't you let it be?

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't you ever say my love, "open up your heart"
No I'm not gonna do it standing up
The words don't come out right when you're right in front of me
Help me baby, won't you turn off the lights

[Chorus]
Lay me down 
Lay me down 
Lay me down 
Lay me down 
Lay me down 
Lay me down 

[Verse 2]
I would never break the rules unless you tell me to
You can read my mind, be it truth or lies
Lie down beside me, why won't you let it be?

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't you ever say my love opened up your heart
No I'm not gonna do it standing up
The words don't come out right when you're right in front of me
Help me baby, won't you turn off the lights

[Chorus]
Lay me down 
Lay me down 
Lay me down 
Lay me down 
Lay me down 
Lay me down 

[Bridge]
Lay down with me
Lay down with me
Lay down with me
Lay down with me

[Pre-Chorus]
Words don't come out right when you're right in front of me
Help me baby, won't you turn off the lights

[Chorus]
Lay me down 
Lay me down 
Lay me down 
Lay me down 
Lay me down 
Lay me down 

[Verse 1]
So little to say but so much time
Despite my empty mouth the words are in my mind
Please wear the face, the one where you smile
Because you lighten up my heart when I start to cry

Forgive me, first love, but I'm tired
I need to get away to feel again
Try to understand why
Don't get so close to change my mind
Please wipe that look out of your eyes
It's bribing me to doubt myself
Simply, it's tiring

[Verse 2]
This love has dried up, and stayed behind
And if I stay I'll be a lie
Then choke on words I'd always hide
Excuse me, first love, but we're through
I need to taste the kiss from someone new
Forgive me, first love, but I'm too tired
I'm bored to say the least and I, I lack desire

[Outro]
Forgive me, first love, forgive me, first love
Forgive me, first love, forgive me, first love, forgive me
Forgive me, first love, forgive me, first love

[Verse 1]
Found myself today singin' out loud your name
You said I'm crazy, if I am I'm crazy for you
Sometimes sittin' in the dark, wishin' you were here
Turns me crazy, but it's you who makes me lose my head

[Pre-Chorus]
And every time I'm meant to be acting sensible
You drift into my head and
Turn me into a crumblin' fool

[Chorus]
Tell me to run and I'll race
If you want me to stop I'll freeze
And if you want me gone, I'll leave
Just hold me closer, baby
And make me crazy for you
Crazy for you

[Verse 2]
Lately with this state I'm in, I can't help myself but spin
I wish you'd come over, send me spinning closer to you
My, oh my, how my blood boils, it's sweet taste for you
Strips me down bare and gets me into my favourite mood

[Pre-Chorus]
I keep on trying, fighting these feelings away
But the more I do
The crazier I turn into

[Chorus]
Pacing floors and opening doors
Hoping you'll walk through
And save me boy
Because I'm too crazy for you
Crazy for you

[Verse 1]
Hold me closer one more time
Say that you love me in your last goodbye
Please forgive me for my sins
Yes, I swam dirty waters but you pushed me in
I've seen your face under every sky
Over every border and on every line
You know my heart more than I do
We were the greatest, me and you

[Pre-Chorus]
But we had time against us and miles between us
The heavens cried, I know I left you speechless
But now the sky has cleared and it's blue
And I see my future in you

[Chorus]
I'll be waiting for you when you're ready to love me again
I'll put my hands up
I'll do everything different, I'll be better to you
I'll be waiting for you when you're ready to love me again
I'll put my hands up
I'll be somebody different, I'll be better to you

[Verse 2]
Let me stay here for just one more night
Build your walls around me pull me to the light
So I can tell you that I was wrong
I was a child then but now I'm willing to learn

[Pre-Chorus]
But we had time against us and miles between us
The heavens cried, I know I left you speechless
But now the sky has cleared and it's blue
And I see my future in you

[Chorus]
I'll be waiting for you when you're ready to love me again
I'll put my hands up
I'll do everything different, I'll be better to you
I'll be waiting for you when you're ready to love me again
I'll put my hands up
I'll be somebody different, I'll be better to you

[Bridge]
Time against us, miles between us
Heavens cried, I know I left you speechless
Time against us, miles between us
Heavens cried, I know I left you speechless
I know I left you speechless
I'll be waiting

[Chorus]
I'll be waiting for you when you're ready to love me again
I'll put my hands up
I'll do everything different, I'll be better to you
I'll be waiting for you when you're ready to love me again
I'll put my hands up
I'll be somebody different, I'll be better to you

[Verse 1]
I thought I told you, he'd be home soon
Couldn't help myself, you're too good to be true
I fall short each time, every time he ain't here
You and your charm creep closer, closer and near
Like a fool for fire, I fall, with my pride and all
Like a bomb before explosion, ticking by your call
You're the wiser one, disguised from greed
And I'm just a child who longs on her knees

[Hook]
But I found a boy who I love more
Than I ever did you before
So stand beside the river I cried
And lay yourself down
Look how you want me now that I don't need you

[Verse 2]
So you thought that I'd crumble to my knees
At the first sight of you crawling back to me
To whisper, "Will you leave your man?"
'Cause you swear that this time you can stand by me
I won't stand by you

[Hook]
'Cause I found a boy who I love more
Than I ever did you before
So stand beside the river I cried
And lay yourself down
Look how you want me now that I don't need you

[Bridge]
I ain't yours for no taking
You must be mistaken
I could never look into your eyes
And settle for wrong and ignore the right

[Hook]
When I found a boy who loves me more
Than you ever did before
So stand beside the river you cried
And lay yourself down
Look how you want me now, but I don't need you

[Verse 1]
Wait, do you see my heart on my sleeve?
It's been there for days on end
And it's been waitin' for you to open up yours too
Baby, come on now, I'm trying to tell you just how
I'd like to hear the words roll out of your mouth finally
Say that it's always been me

[Pre-Chorus]
That's made you feel a way you've never felt before
And I'm all you need and that you never want more
Then you'd say all of the right things without a clue
But you'd save the best for last like I'm the one for you

[Chorus]
You should know that you're just a temporary fix
This is not rooted with you, it don't mean that much to me
You're just a filler in the space that happened to be free
How dare you think you'd get away with tryin' to play me

[Verse 2]
Why is it every time I think I've tried my hardest
It turns out it ain't enough?
You're still not mentioning love
What am I supposed to do to make you want me properly?
I'm takin' these chances and getting nowhere
And though I'm trying my hardest you go back to her
And I think that I know things may never change
I'm still hopin' one day I might hear you say

[Pre-Chorus]
I make you feel a way you've never felt before
And I'm all you need and that you never want more
Then you'd say all of the right things without a clue
But you'd save the best for last like I'm the one for you

[Chorus]
You should know that you're just a temporary fix
This is not rooted with you, it don't mean that much to me
You're just a filler in the space that happened to be free
How dare you think you'd get away with tryin' to play me

[Bridge]
But, despite the truth that I know
I find it hard to let go and give up on you
Seems I love the things you do
Like the meaner you treat me, more eager I am
To persist with this heartbreak of runnin' around
And I will do until I find myself with you

[Outro]
And make you feel a way you've never felt before
And be all you need so that you never want more
Then you'd say all of the right things without a clue
And you'll be the one for me and me the one for you[Produced by Jim Abbiss]

[Verse 1]
Who wants to be right as rain?
It's better when something is wrong
You get excitement in your bones
And everything you do's a game
When night comes, and you're on your own
You can say, "I chose to be alone"
Who wants to be right as rain?
It's harder when you're on top

[Chorus]
'Cause when hard work don't pay off and I'm tired
There ain't no room in my bed, as far as I'm concerned
So wipe that dirty smile off
We won't be making up, I've cried my heart out
And now I've had enough of love

[Verse 2]
Who wants to be riding high
When you'll just crumble back on down?
You give up everything you are
And even then, you don't get far
They make believe that everything
Is exactly what it seems
But at least when you're at your worst
You know how to feel things

[Chorus]
See, when hard work don't pay off and I'm tired
There ain't no room in my bed, as far as I'm concerned
So wipe that dirty smile off
We won't be making up, I've cried my heart out
And now, I've had enough of 

[Bridge]
Go ahead and steal my heart to make me cry again
'Cause it will never hurt as much it did then
When we were both right, and no one had blame
But now, I give up on this endless game

[Verse 3]
'Cause who wants to be right as rain?
It's better when something is wrong
I get excitement in my bones
Even though everything's a strain
When night comes, and I'm on my own
You should know I chose to be alone
Who wants to be right as rain?
It's harder when you're on top

[Chorus]
'Cause when hard work don't pay off and I'm tired
There ain't no room in my bed, as far as I'm concerned
So wipe that dirty smile off
We won't be making up, I've cried my heart out
And now, I've had enough of

[Outro]
No room in my bed, as far as I'm concerned
So wipe that dirty smile off
We won't be making up, I've cried my heart out
And now, I've had enough of love

[Verse 1: Adele]
Picture perfect memories
Scattered all around the floor
Reaching for the phone 'cause
I can't fight it anymore

[Pre-Chorus: Both]
And I wonder if I ever cross your mind
For me it happens all the time

[Chorus: Both]
It's a quarter after one, I'm all alone and I need you now
Said I wouldn't call, but I lost all control and I need you now
And I don't know how I can do without, I just need you now

[Verse 2: Darius Rucker]
Another shot of whiskey
Can't stop looking at the door, yeah
Wishing you'd come sweeping
In the way you did before

[Pre-Chorus: Both]
And I wonder if I ever cross your mind
For me it happens all the time

[Chorus: Both]
It's a quarter after one, I'm little drunk and I need you now
Said I wouldn't call, but I lost all control and I need you now
And I don't know how I can do without
I just need you now

[Bridge: Both]
Yes, I'd rather hurt than feel nothing at all

[Chorus: Both]
It's a quarter after one, I'm all alone and I need you now
And I said I wouldn't call, but I'm a little drunk and I need you now
And I don't know how I can do without, I just need you now

[Outro: Both]
I just need you now
Oh, I need you now
Oh baby, I need you now
I just need you now

[Verse 1]
This is how the story went
I met someone by accident
Who blew me away, blew me away
And It was in the darkest of my days
When you took my sorrow and you took my pain
And buried them away, buried them away

[Chorus]
I wish I could lay down beside you when the day is done
And wake up to your face against the morning sun
But like everything I've ever known, you'll disappear one day
So I'll spend my whole life hiding my heart away

[Verse 2]
Dropped you off at the train station
Put a kiss on top of your head
Watched you wave and watched you wave
Then I went on home to my skyscrapers
And neon lights and waiting papers
That I call home, I call that home

[Chorus]
I wish I could lay down beside you when the day is done
And wake up to your face against the morning sun
But like everything I've ever known, you'll disappear one day
So I'll spend my whole life hiding my heart away

[Verse 3]
Woke up feeling heavyhearted
I'm going back to where I started
The morning rain, the morning rain
And though I wish that you were here
On that same old road that brought me here
It's calling me home, it's calling me home

[Chorus]
I wish I could lay down beside you when the day is done
And wake up to your face against the morning sun
But like everything I've ever known, you'll disappear one day
So I'll spend my whole life hiding my heart away
I can spend my whole life hiding my heart away

[Intro]
Aye, aye, aye-aye
Aye, aye, aye-aye
Aye, aye, aye-aye
Aye, aye, aye-aye

[Chorus]
You said I'm stubborn and I never give in
I think you're stubborn 'cept you're always softening
You say I'm selfish, I agree with you on that
I think you're giving nothing way too much, in fact
I say we've only known each other a year
You say, "*Pfft*, I've known you longer, my dear"
You like to be so close, I like to be alone
I like to sit on chairs and you prefer the floor
Walking with each other, think we'll never match at all
But we do, but we do, do-do-do
But we do, but we do, do-do-do, do-do-do-do

[Verse]
I thought I knew myself, somehow you know me more
I've never known this, never before
You're the first to make up whenever we argue
I don't know who I'd be if I didn't know you
You're so provocative, I'm so conservative
You're so adventurous, I'm so very cautious, combining
You'd think we wouldn't, we do, but we do, do-do-do
But we do, but we do, do-do-do, do-do-do-do

[Bridge]
Aye, aye, aye-aye
Aye, aye, aye-aye
Your, your-your, your
Your, your-your, your...
Favoritism ain't my thing but
In this situation, I'll be glad
Favoritism ain't my thing but
In this situation, I'll be glad to make an exception 

[Chorus]
You said I'm stubborn and I never give in
I think you're stubborn 'cept you're always softening
You say I'm selfish, I agree with you on that
I think you're giving nothing way too much, in fact
I say we've only known each other a year
You say, "*Pfft*, I've known you longer, my dear"
You like to be so close, I like to be alone
I like to sit on chairs and you prefer the floor
Walking with each other, think we'll never match at all
But we do[Produced by Mark Ronson]

[Verse 1]
You say it's all in my head
And the things I think just don't make sense
So where you been then? Don't go all coy
Don't turn it 'round on me like it's my fault
See I can see that look in your eyes
The one that shoots me each and every time

[Chorus]
You grace me with your cold shoulder
Whenever you look at me I wish I was her
You shower me with words made of knives
Whenever you look at me I wish I was her

[Verse 2]
These days when I see you
You make it look like I'm see-through
Do tell me why you waste our time
When your heart ain't in it and you're not satisfied
You know I know just how you feel
I'm starting to find myself feeling that way too when

[Chorus]
You grace me with your cold shoulder
Whenever you look at me I wish I was her
You shower me with words made of knives
Whenever you look at me I wish I was her

[Bridge]
Time and time again, I play the role of fool

And even in the daylight when your gaming

I try to look for things I hear but my eyes never find
Though I do know how you play

[Chorus]
You grace me with your cold shoulder
Whenever you look at me I wish I was her
You shower me with words made of knives
Whenever you look at me I wish I was her
You grace me with your cold shoulder
Whenever you look at me I wish I was her
You shower me with words made of knives
Whenever you look at me I wish I was her

[Verse 1: Andrew Taggart]
Hey, I was doing just fine before I met you
I drink too much
And that's an issue, but I'm okay
Hey, you tell your friends
It was nice to meet them
But I hope I never see them again

[Pre-Chorus: Andrew Taggart]
I know it breaks your heart
Moved to the city in a broke-down car
And four years, no calls
Now you're lookin' pretty in a hotel bar
And I-I-I can't stop
No, I-I-I can't stop

[Chorus: Andrew Taggart]
So, baby, pull me closer
In the backseat of your Rover
That I know you can't afford
Bite that tattoo on your shoulder
Pull the sheets right off the corner
Of the mattress that you stole
From your roommate back in Boulder
We ain't ever getting older

[Post-Chorus: Andrew Taggart]
We ain't ever getting older
We ain't ever getting older

[Verse 2: Halsey]
You look as good as the day I met you
I forget just why I left you, I was insane
Stay and play that blink-182 song
That we beat to death in Tucson, okay

[Pre-Chorus: Halsey]
I know it breaks your heart
Moved to the city in a broke-down car
And four years, no call
Now I'm lookin' pretty in a hotel bar
And I-I-I can't stop
No, I-I-I can't stop

[Chorus: Andrew Taggart & Halsey]
So, baby, pull me closer
In the backseat of your Rover
That I know you can't afford
Bite that tattoo on your shoulder
Pull the sheets right off the corner
Of the mattress that you stole
From your roommate back in Boulder
We ain't ever getting older

[Post-Chorus: Andrew Taggart & Halsey]
We ain't ever getting older
We ain't ever getting older

[Chorus: Andrew Taggart]
So, baby, pull me closer
In the backseat of your Rover
That I know you can't afford
Bite that tattoo on your shoulder
Pull the sheets right off the corner
Of the mattress that you stole
From your roommate back in Boulder
We ain't ever getting older

[Post-Chorus: Andrew Taggart & Halsey]
We ain't ever getting older

We ain't ever getting older

We ain't ever getting older

We ain't ever getting older


[Verse 1: Andrew Taggart]
We were staying in Paris
To get away from your parents
And I thought, Wow
If I could take this in a shot right now
I don't think that we could work this out
Out on the terrace
I don't know if it's fair but I thought How could I let you fall by yourself
While I'm wasted with someone else?

[Chorus: Andrew Taggart]
If we go down then we go down together
They'll say you could do anything
They'll say that I was clever
If we go down then we go down together
We'll get away with everything
Let's show them we are better

[Break: Andrew Taggart]
Let's show them we are better
Let's show them we are better

[Verse 2: Andrew Taggart]
We were staying in Paris
To get away from your parents
You look so proud
Standing there with a frown and a cigarette
Posting pictures of yourself on the Internet
Out on the terrace
We breathe in the air of this small town on our own, cuttin' class for the thrill of it
Getting drunk on the past, we were livin' in

[Chorus: Andrew Taggart & Emily Warren]
If we go down then we go down together
They'll say you could do anything
They'll say that I was clever
If we go down then we go down together
We'll get away with everything
Let's show them we are better

[Bridge: Emily Warren & Andrew Taggart]
Let's show them we are
Show them we are
Let's show them we are
Show them we are
Let's show them we are better
We were staying in Paris
Let's show them we are better
Let's show them we are
Show them we are
Let's show them we are
Show them we are
Let's show them we are better

[Chorus: Andrew Taggart & Emily Warren]
If we go down then we go down together
They'll say you could do anything
They'll say that I was clever
If we go down then we go down together
We'll get away with everything
Let's show them we are better

[Refrain: Andrew Taggart & Emily Warren]
We were staying in Paris 
We were staying in Paris 
We were staying in Paris 
We were staying in Paris 
Let's show them we are better
We were staying in Paris

[Outro: Andrew Taggart & Emily Warren]
Let's show them we are better
Let's show them we are better
If we go down
Let's show them we are better
If we go down
Let's show them we are better
If we go down
Let's show them we are better
Let's show them we are better

[Verse 1: Phoebe Ryan & Andrew Taggart]
Fighting flames with fire
Hang onto burning wires
We don't care anymore
Are we fading lovers?
We keep wasting colors
Maybe we should let this go

[Pre-Chorus: Phoebe Ryan & Andrew Taggart]
We're falling apart, still we hold together
We've passed the end, so we chase forever
'Cause this is all we know
This feeling's all we know

[Chorus: Phoebe Ryan & Andrew Taggart]
I'll ride my bike up to the road
Down the streets right through the city
I'll go everywhere you go
From Chicago to the coast
You tell me, "Hit this and let's go
Blow the smoke right through the window"
'Cause this is all we know

[Post-Chorus: Phoebe Ryan & Andrew Taggart]
'Cause this is all we know
'Cause this is all we know

[Verse 2: Phoebe Ryan & Andrew Taggart]
Never face each other
One bed, different covers
We don't care anymore
Two hearts still beating
On with different rhythms
Maybe we should let this go

[Pre-Chorus: Phoebe Ryan & Andrew Taggart]
We're falling apart, still we hold together
We've passed the end, so we chase forever
'Cause this is all we know
This feeling's all we know

[Chorus: Phoebe Ryan & Andrew Taggart]
I'll ride my bike up to the road
Down the streets right through the city
I'll go everywhere you go
From Chicago to the coast
You tell me, "Hit this and let's go
Blow the smoke right through the window"
'Cause this is all we know

[Post-Chorus: Phoebe Ryan & Andrew Taggart]
'Cause this is all we know
'Cause this is all we know

[Verse: ROZES]
Take it slow, but it's not typical
He already knows that my love is fire
His heart was a stone, but then his hands roam
I turned him to gold and took him higher

[Pre-Chorus: ROZES]
Well, I'll be your daydream, I'll be your favorite things
We could be beautiful
Get drunk on the good life, I'll take you to paradise
Say you'll never let me go

[Chorus: ROZES & Andrew Taggart]
Deep in my bones, I can feel you
Take me back to a time only we knew
Hideaway
We could waste the night with an old film
Smoke a little weed on my couch in the back room
Hideaway
Say you'll never let me go
Say you'll never let me go

[Post-Chorus: ROZES]
Ahh, ahh, ahh
Ahh, ahh, ahh
Ahh, ahh, ahh
Say you'll never let me go
Say you'll never let me go
Say you'll never let me go
Ahh
Ahh
Say you'll never let me go

[Chorus: ROZES & Andrew Taggart]
Deep in my bones, I can feel you
Take me back to a time only we knew
Hideaway
We could waste the night with an old film
Smoke a little weed on my couch in the back room
Hideaway
Say you'll never let me go
Say you'll never let me go

[Outro: ROZES]
Ahh, ahh, ahh
Ahh, ahh, ahh
Ahh, ahh, ahh
Say you'll never let me go
Ahh
Say you'll never let me go
Ahh

[Verse 1: Kelsea Ballerini]
I'll tell you a story before it tells itself
I'll lay out all my reasons, you'll say that I need help
We all got expectations, and sometimes they go wrong
But no one listens to me, so I put it in this song

[Pre-Chorus: Kelsea Ballerini]
They tell me think with my head, not that thing in my chest
They got their hands at my neck this time
But you're the one that I want, and if that's really so wrong
Then they don't know what this feeling is like

[Chorus: Kelsea Ballerini & Andrew Taggart]
And I say yeah-eah, yeah-eah-eah-eah
Yeah-eah, yeah-eah-eah-eah
And I say yeah-eah, yeah-eah-eah-eah
Yeah-eah, yeah-eah-eah-eah

[Verse 2: Andrew Taggart]
I'll tell them a story, they'll sit and nod their heads
I tell you all my secrets, and you tell all your friends
Hold on to your opinions, and stand by what you said 
In the end, it's my decision, so it's my fault when it ends

[Pre-Chorus: Kelsea Ballerini & Andrew Taggart]
They tell me think with my head, not that thing in my chest
They got their hands at my neck this time
But you're the one that I want, and if that's really so wrong
Then they don't know what this feeling is like

[Chorus: Andrew Taggart]
And I say yeah-eah, yeah-eah-eah-eah
Yeah-eah, yeah-eah-eah-eah
And I say yeah-eah, yeah-eah-eah-eah
Yeah-eah, yeah-eah-eah-eah

[Verse 3: Kelsea Ballerini & Andrew Taggart]
I'll tell you a story before it tells itself
I'll lay out all my reasons, you'll say that I need help
We all got expectations, and sometimes they go wrong
But no one listens to me, so I put it in this song

[Pre-Chorus: Kelsea Ballerini & Andrew Taggart]
They tell me think with my head, not that thing in my chest
They got their hands at my neck this time
But you're the one that I want, and if that's really so wrong
Then they don't know what this feeling is like

[Bridge: Kelsea Ballerini & Andrew Taggart]
My friends say no-o, no-o-o 
No-o, no-o-o
Yeah, no-o, no-o-o
They don't know, no no 

[Outro: Andrew Taggart & Kelsea Ballerini]
And I say yeah, oh oh
Oh, and I say yeah, hey-ey, yeah
They don't know, oh

[Verse 1]
Crashing, hit a wall
Right now I need a miracle
Hurry up now, I need a miracle
Stranded, reaching out
I call your name, but you're not around
I say your name, but you're not around

[Chorus]
I need you, I need you, I need you right now
Yeah, I need you right now
So don't let me, don't let me, don't let me down
I think I'm losing my mind now
It's in my head, darling, I hope
That you'll be here when I need you the most
So don't let me, don't let me, don't let me down
D-don't let me down
Don't let me down

[Post-Chorus]
Don't let me down, down, down
Don't let me down
Don't let me down, down, down

[Verse 2]
R-r-running out of time
I really thought you were on my side
But now there's nobody by my side

[Chorus]
I need you, I need you, I need you right now
Yeah, I need you right now
So don't let me, don't let me, don't let me down
I think I'm losing my mind now
It's in my head, darling, I hope
That you'll be here when I need you the most
So don't let me, don't let me, don't let me down
D-don't let me down
Don't let me down

[Post-Chorus]
Don't let me down, down, down
Don't let me down, down, down
Don't let me down, down, down
Don't let me down
Don't let me down, down, down

[Bridge]
Ooh, I think I'm losing my mind now, yeah
Ooh, I think I'm losing my mind now, yeah

[Chorus]
I need you, I need you, I need you right now
Yeah, I need you right now
So don't let me, don't let me, don't let me down
I think I'm losing my mind now
It's in my head, darling, I hope
That you'll be here when I need you the most
So don't let me, don't let me, don't let me down
Don't let me down

[Outro]
Yeah, don't let me down
Yeah, don't let me down
Don't let me down, oh, no
Say don't let me down
Don't let me down, no-o
Don't let me down
Don't let me down, down, down

[Verse 1]
I'm from the east side of America
Where we choose pride over character
And we can pick sides, but this is us, this is us, this is
I live on the west side of America
Where they spin lies into fairy dust
And we can pick sides, but this is us, this is us, this is

[Refrain]
And don't believe the narcissism
When everyone projects and expects you to listen to 'em
Make no mistake, I live in a prison
That I built myself, it is my religion
And they say that I am the sick boy
Easy to say when you don't take the risk, boy
Welcome to the narcissism
Yeah, we're united under our indifference

[Verse 2]
And I'm from the east side of America
Where we desensitize by hysteria
And we can pick sides, but this is us, this is us, this is
I live on the west side of America
Where they spin lies into fairy dust
And we can pick sides, but this is us, this is us, this is

[Chorus]
I am the, I am the, I am the sick boy
I am the, I am the, I am the sick boy

They say that I am the sick boy

And they call me the sick boy

[Refrain]
Don't believe the narcissism
When everyone projects and expects you to listen to 'em
Make no mistake, I live in a prison
That I built myself, it is my religion
And they say that I am the sick boy
Easy to say when you don't take the risk, boy
Welcome to the narcissism
Where we're united under our indifference

[Bridge]
Feed yourself with my life's work
How many likes is my life worth?
Feed yourself with my life's work
How many likes is my life worth?
Feed yourself with my life's work
How many likes is my life worth?
Feed yourself on my life's work
How many likes is my life worth?

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm from the east side of America
I am the, I am the, I am the sick boy
I live on the west side of America
I am the, I am the, I am the sick boy
I'm from the east side of America
They say that I am the sick boy
I live on the west side of America
Yeah, they call me the sick boy

[Chorus]
I am the, I am the, I am the sick boy
I am the, I am the, I am the sick boy

They say that I am the sick boy

Yeah, they call me the sick boy

[Verse 1]
You know, I'm sorry
I won't make it to your party
Got caught up in my own selfishness
It won't let me be a part of this
And I know I've started
Drifting off every second
I can't wait to leave as soon as I
Arrive, I count the seconds

[Chorus]
Down and down we go
We'll torch this place we know
Before one of us takes a chance
And breaks this, I won't be the one
No, I won't be the one

[Verse 2]
I know it's pathetic
Fuck it, yeah, I said it
Tried to tell it like it is
There's a chance that I'll regret it, so
Let's go, let's end this
I delete before I send it
And we can play pretend
Like we haven't reached the end yet

[Chorus]
Down and down we go
And we'll torch this place we know
Before one of us takes a chance
And breaks this, I won't be the one
No, I won't be the one

[Breakdown]


No, I won't be the one
No, I won't be the one

[Chorus: Drew Love]
In the town full of fancy cars and
Crowded bars and supermodels
Looks exactly the way it did inside my head
When I dreamed about it
All the things I could live without
I need 'em now 'cause they're all around me
Only thing that I can't afford is to lose myself
Tryna please somebody, somebody

[Verse 1: Andrew Taggart]
You should've known better
Than to listen to your heart again
People change with the weather

I don't really like anybody
So don't tell me I'm like anybody else
You put it back together
Don't let it fall apart again
People change with the weather

[Chorus: Drew Love]
In the town full of fancy cars and
Crowded bars and supermodels
Looks exactly the way it did inside my head
When I dreamed about it
All the things I could live without
I need 'em now 'cause they're all around me
Only thing that I can't afford is to lose myself
Tryna please somebody, somebody

[Post-Chorus: Drew Love & Andrew Taggart]
Somebody
Somebody

Somebody

[Verse 2: Andrew Taggart]
In my head, I knew better 
I won't blame it on my faults again
I know I should forget her

I don't really like anybody
So don't tell me I'm like anybody

[Chorus: Drew Love, Both]
In the town full of fancy cars and
Crowded bars and supermodels
Looks exactly the way it did inside my head
When I dreamed about it
All the things I could live without
I need 'em now 'cause they're all around me
Only thing that I can't afford is to lose myself
Tryna please somebody, somebody

[Post-Chorus: Drew Love & Andrew Taggart]
Somebody, somebody

[Bridge: Andrew Taggart]
'Cause I don't really like anybody
So don't tell me I'm like anybody
'Cause I don't really like anybody
So don't tell me I'm like anybody

[Chorus: Drew Love, Both]
In the town full of fancy cars and

Somebody, somebody

[Outro: Drew Love]
Lose myself tryna please somebody
Lose myself tryna please somebody

[Verse 1]
I don't really say this that often
But there's somethin' that the papers forgot
Every time I read them, I know I feed them
But I know, they're painting, but they can't leave a mark
'Cause my friends don't read the papers
And they don't really care if we're awesome or not
So every time I read them, I know I feed them
But I know, they wanna see me hang on the wall

[Chorus]
You don't know me, don't you think that I get lonely?
It gets dark inside my head
Check my pulse, and if I'm dead, you owe me
If you're lonely, don't you think you're on your own?
When it gets dark inside your head
Check my pulse, and if I'm there, you owe me

[Verse 2]
Say it to my face if you mean it
Say it to my face, but you won't
I know I'm not losin', but I'm losin' my mind
Does anybody know what that's like?

[Chorus]
You don't know me, don't you think that I get lonely?
It gets dark inside my head
Check my pulse, and if I'm dead, you owe me
If you're lonely, don't you think you're on your own?
When it gets dark inside your head
Check my pulse, and if I'm there, you owe me

[Bridge]
Yeah, if I'm there, you owe me
Yeah, if I'm there, you owe me
You owe me, you owe me
You owe me, you owe me
If I'm there, you owe me

[Drop]
Yeah, if I'm there, you owe me


[Chorus]
You don't know me, don't you think that I get lonely?
It gets dark inside my head
Check my pulse and if I'm dead, you owe me
If you're lonely, don't you think you're on your own?
When it gets dark inside your head
Check my pulse, and if I'm there, you owe me

[Intro]
Yeah, let's do it again but, uh, this time, uh, let's go full psycho

[Verse 1]
Yeah, I just wanna drink tequila with my friend
She says she cheated 'cause she's tryna get ahead
The more I read it, yeah, the more I take offense
I'm so defeated, I can't get outside my head
I post a picture of myself 'cause I'm lonely
Everyone knows what I look like
Not even one of them knows me
Yeah, I just wanna drink tequila with my friends
I'm so defeated, I just want this shit to end

[Chorus]
So I walk into the club like everybody hates me
I walk into the club like everybody hates me
I'm talkin' to myself, shit, now they think I'm crazy
I walk into the club like everybody hates me 
Like everybody hates me

[Drop]
Like everybody hates me 

[Verse 2]
I'm a product of the internet
And now, I'm face to face with all the voices in my head
I can't even check the time without facing regret
Why do I still have to mean everything I ever said?
And I'm not tryna be like, "Poor me," I made it
I'm just trying to stay normal now that they know what my name is
Yeah, I just wanna drink tequila with my friends
Yeah, they're the reason that I still am who I am

[Chorus]
So I walk into the club like everybody hates me
I walk into the club like everybody hates me
I'm talkin' to myself, shit, now they think I'm crazy
I walk into the club like everybody hates me 
Like everybody hates me

[Drop]
Like everybody, everybody hates me 

[Bridge]
I walk into the club like everybody hates me
I walk into the club like everybody hates me
I walk into the club like everybody hates me

[Drop]
I walk into the club like everybody, yeah
Everybody 
I walk into the club like everybody, yeah
Everybody 
I walk into the club like, everybody hates me

[Outro]
Everybody, yeah, everybody

[Verse 1: Winona Oak]
I would have walked through fire to kiss your lips
Do you still think about it, of what you did?
Still see your old apartment, like a bad trip
Wish I could forget all the places we've been

[Pre-Chorus: Winona Oak]
Hard and heavy whiskey goodbyes
Boy, you know how to make a girl cry
Was sleeping in a bed full of lies
And now that I'm older, I can see why

[Chorus: Winona Oak]
You made me feel high
'Cause you had me so low, low, low
You only seemed tall
'Cause you stunted my grow-grow-growth
I only wanted you 'cause I couldn't have you
Now that I know
That wasn't love, that wasn't love, that was just hope

[Post-Chorus: Winona Oak]
Hope
Hope
Hope
That wasn't love, that wasn't love, that was just hope

[Verse 2: Andrew Taggart]
Always another bender, I lose control
I thought I'd get it back when
You came back home to me, darling
But I never had it, did I? Your heart's a trick
And all the magic we felt was just a hit

[Pre-Chorus: Winona Oak & Andrew Taggart]
Hard and heavy whiskey goodbyes
Boy, you know how to make a girl cry
Was sleeping in a bed full of lies
And now that I'm older, I can see why

[Chorus: Winona Oak & Andrew Taggart]
You made me feel high
'Cause you had me so low, low, low
You only seemed tall
'Cause you stunted my grow-grow-growth
I only wanted you 'cause I couldn't have you
Now that I know 
That wasn't love, that wasn't love, that was just hope

[Post-Chorus: Winona Oak & Andrew Taggart]
Hope
Hope 
Hope 
That wasn't love, that wasn't love, that was just hope

[Chorus: Winona Oak & Andrew Taggart]
'Cause you had me so low, low, low
You only seemed tall
'Cause you stunted my grow-grow-growth
I only wanted you 'cause I couldn't have you
Now that I know 
That wasn't love, that wasn't love, that was just hope

[Verse 1]
Young
We were so young when we thought that we knew how to love
Fought about anything, everything led to dysfunction
But we just gotta own that shit
Don't let it go like this
Maybe we can grow from this, yeah

[Chorus]
We both know I go too far like when I wrecked your car
And almost fought your father when he pushed me in the yard
And all those nights we snuck out, like to meet up at the bar
Don't worry, my love, we're learning to love
But it's hard when you're young

[Hook]
Yeah, it's hard when you're young

[Verse 2]
Caught, we were caught up in the high, it was better than drugs
Too high to see that it would all lead to destruction
At least we both know that shit
We just gotta own that shit
I hope that we can grow from this, yeah

[Chorus]
We both know I go too far like when I wrecked your car
And almost fought your father when he pushed me in the yard
And all those nights we snuck out, like to meet up at the bar
Don't worry, my love, we're learning to love
But it's hard when you're young

[Hook]
Yeah, it's hard when you're young
Yeah, yeah, it's hard when you're young

(I'm calling you up, you tell me it's over
Say what you want, but it's hard when you're young
I'm calling you up, you tell me it's over
You say what you want, but it's hard when you're young)

[Chorus]
We both know I go too far like when I wrecked your car
And almost fought your father when he pushed me in the yard
And all those nights we snuck out, like to meet up at the bar
Don't worry, my love, we're learning to love
But it's hard when you're young

[Bridge]
I'm calling you up, you tell me it's over
Say what you want, but it's hard when you're young
I'm calling you up, you tell me it's over
You say what you want, but it's hard when you're young
I'm calling you up, you tell me it's over
You say what you want, but it's hard when you're young

[Outro]
Yeah, it's hard when you're young
Yeah, it's hard when you're young
Yeah, oh, yeah, it's hard when you're young
I'm calling you up, you tell me it's over
You say what you want, but it's hard when you're young
I'm calling you up, you tell me it's over
You say what you want, but it's hard when you're young

[Intro: Bono]
The other one is, of course, outing yourself
I think be the first to out yourself, I always think
Because, you know, there's no end to the hypocrisy of the human heart

Woah, woah, woah
Woah, woah, woah
Woah, woah, woah
Woah, woah, woah

[Verse 1]
It's 5 a.m. and I'm on the radio
I'm supposed to call you, but I don't know what to say at all
And there's this girl, she wants me to take her home
She don't really love me though, I'm just on the radio

[Pre-Chorus]
And I'm not gonna tell you that I'm over it
'Cause I think about it every night I'm not sober, and
I know I keep these feelings to myself
Like I don't need nobody else
But you're not the only one on my mind

[Chorus]
If I'm being honest
If I'm being honest
You said I should be honest
So I'm being honest

[Verse 2]
It's 6 a.m., I'm so far away from you
I don't wanna let you down, what am I supposed to do?
It's been three weeks at least, now, since I've been gone
And I don't even like the road, I'm just on the radio

[Pre-Chorus]
And I'm not gonna tell you that I'm over it
'Cause I think about it every night I'm not sober, and
I know I keep these feelings to myself
Like I don't need nobody else
But you're not the only one on my mind

[Chorus]
If I'm being honest
If I'm being honest
You said I should be honest
So I'm being honest

[Bridge]
Woah, woah, woah
Woah, woah, woah
Woah, woah, woah
Woah, woah, woah
Woah, woah, woah
Woah, woah, woah
Woah, woah, woah
Woah, woah, woah

[Pre-Chorus]
And I'm not gonna tell you that I'm over it
'Cause I think about it every night I'm not sober, and
I know I keep these feelings to myself
Like I don't need nobody else
But you're not the only one on my mind

[Chorus]
If I'm being honest
If I'm being honest
You said I should be honest
So I'm being honest

If I'm being honest

[Verse 1]
When Jason was at the table
I kept on seeing him look at me when he was with that other girl
Do you think he was just doing that to make me jealous?
Because, he was totally texting me all night last night
And I don't know if it's a booty call or not
So... like what do you think?
Did you think that girl was pretty?
How did that girl even get in here?
Did you see her?
She's so short, and that dress is so tacky
Who wears Cheetah?
It's not even summer, why does the DJ keep on playing "Summertime Sadness"?
After we go to the bathroom, can we go smoke a cigarette?
I really need one
But first
Let me take a selfie

[Beat Break]
Let me take a selfie

[Verse 2]
Can you guys help me pick a filter?
I don't know if I should go with XX Pro or Valencia
I wanna look tan
What should my caption be?
I want it to be clever
How about "Living with my bitches, #LIV"
I only got 10 likes in the last 5 minutes
Do you think I should take it down?
Let me take another selfie

[Beat Break]
Selfie, selfie, let me take a selfie

[Verse 3]
Wait, pause, Jason just liked my selfie
What a creep
Is that guy sleeping over there?
Yeah, the one next to the girl with no shoes on
That's so ratchet
That girl is such a fake model
She definitely bought all her Instagram followers
Who goes out on Mondays?
Ok, let's go take some shots
Oh no, I feel like I'm gonna throw up
Oh wait, never mind, I'm fine
Let's go dance
There's no vodka at this table
Do you know anyone else here?
Oh my god, Jason just texted me
Should I go home with him?
I guess I took a good selfie

[Outro]
Selfie...
Let me take a selfie
Let me take a selfie

[Verse 1]
To know what it's like to love somebody the way I love you
To know what it's like to love somebody the way I love you
To know how it feels to kill yourself with bad habits
To know what you want, know you'll never truly have it

[Chorus]
New York City, please go easy on me tonight
New York City, please go easy on this heart of mine
Cause I'm losing my lover to the arms of another
New York City, please go easy on me tonight
New York City, please go easy on me tonight

[Verse 2]
When I went away, saw your face in my rear-view
I know that look on your face, that I had lost you

[Chorus]
New York City, please go easy on me tonight
New York City, please go easy on this heart of mine
Cause I'm losing my lover to the arms of another
New York City, please go easy on me tonight

[Bridge]
You promised, I promised
I never knew I could be this selfish
Nights downtown, it's a new town
But I keep thinking I see your face in the crowd
But you're not here and you won't be
Cause you love me enough to let go of me

[Chorus]
New York City, please go easy on me tonight
New York City, please go easy on this heart of mine
Cause I'm losing my lover to the arms of another
New York City, please go easy on me tonight

[Verse 1: Emily Warren]
It's 4AM, I don't know where to go
Everywhere is closed, I should just go home, yeah
My feet are taking me to your front door
I know I shouldn't though, heaven only knows

[Pre-Chorus 1: Emily Warren]
That, ooh, the side effect to my loneliness is you

[Chorus 1: Emily Warren]
Ooh, you're all that I want
No good at giving you up
Come on and give me some love tonight
Ooh, you're all that I want
No good at giving you up
Come on and give me some love tonight

[Verse 2: Emily Warren]
This happens every time I try to mix
Decision making with one too many drinks

[Pre-Chorus 2: Emily Warren]
But, ooh, if late night friends have consequences, cool, yeah

[Chorus 2: Emily Warren]
Ooh, you're all that I want
No good at giving you up
Come on and give me some love tonight
Ooh, you're all that I want
No good at giving you up
Come on and give me some love tonight
Ooh, I think about it all the time
Make it happen in my mind, I'm telling you, yeah
Ooh, you're all that I want
No good at giving you up
Come on and give me some love tonight

[Bridge: Emily Warren & Andrew Taggart]
Time should've taught me the lesson
Went looking for a sign, but instead, I got a message
I take off my pride every time we undressing
Draw the line, I'm by the line 
Time should've taught me the lesson
Went looking for a sign, but instead, I got a message
I take off my pride every time we undressing
Draw the line, I'm by the line

[Chorus 2: Emily Warren]
Ooh, you're all that I want
No good at giving you up
Come on and give me some love tonight, yeah
Ooh, you're all that I want
No good at giving you up
Come on and give me some love tonight, yeah
I, I think about it all the time
Make it happen in my mind, I'm telling you, yeah
Ooh, you're all that I want
No good at giving you up
Come on and give me some love tonight

[Outro: Emily Warren & Andrew Taggart]
Time should've taught me the lesson
Went looking for a sign, but instead, I got a message
I take off my pride every time we undressing
Draw the line, I'm by the line 
Time should've taught me the lesson
Went looking for a sign, but instead, I got a message
I take off my pride every time we undressing
Draw the line, I'm by the line 

[Chorus]
She wants to break up every night
She wants to break up every night
Don't wanna wait until she finally decides to feel it
She wants to break up every night
Then tries to fuck me back to life
How can I help it if I like the way she makes me feel it?

[Verse 1]
"Give me time, give me space, give me reason."
That's what you tell me when you're leaving
Change your mind every night like the seasons
You're insatiable

[Pre-Chorus]
And I know you say you want it now 
Give me the runaround 
Which one am I with now?
She's got seven personalities, every one's a tragedy

[Chorus]
She wants to break up every night
She wants to break up every night
Don't wanna wait until she finally decides to feel it
She wants to break up every night
Then tries to fuck me back to life
How can I help it if I like the way she makes me feel it?

[Verse 2]
Been to France one time and you're Parisian
Joined the real world, new season
Check my phone, check my pulse, ain't a reason
I kinda love it though

[Pre-Chorus]
And I know you say you need me now 
Give me the runaround 
Which one am I with now?
She's got seven personalities, every one's a tragedy

[Chorus]
She wants to break up every night
She wants to break up every night
Don't wanna wait until she finally decides to feel it
She wants to break up every night
Then tries to fuck me back to life
How can I help it if I like the way she makes me feel it?
She wants to break up every night
She wants to break up every night
Don't wanna wait until she finally decides to feel it

[Bridge]
So I build the bridges up, the bridges up
Build the bridges up again
Build the bridges up, the bridges up
Build the bridges up again
Build the bridges up, the bridges up
Build the bridges up again, oh

[Chorus]
She wants to break up every night
She wants to break up every night
Don't wanna wait until she finally decides to feel it
She wants to break up every night
Then tries to fuck me back to life
How can I help it if I like the way she makes me feel it?

I've been drunk three times this week
Spent all my money on a fleeting moment
I thought I-I-I-I-I-I can shake this off
Now I-I-I-I-I-I can't make this stop
Yeah, things were sweet three months ago
When I was living how I wanna on my own
And I thought I-I-I-I-I-I don't need that much
I guess I-I-I-I-I-I was out of touch

[Chorus]
I'm fucked up, I'm faded
I'm so complicated
Those things that I said
They were so overrated
But I-I-I-I-I-I, yeah, I meant it
Oh yeah, I-I-I-I-I-I, really fucking meant it

Yeah, I meant it

[Verse 2]
I gave up three times this week
Went through those feelings
Like I wasn't worth nothing
I thought I-I-I-I-I-I can shake this off
No, I-I-I-I-I-I can't be this soft

[Chorus]
I'm fucked up, I'm faded
I'm so complicated
Those things that I said

Might have started off rocky and ruined our firstdate
Butlast night, whenyou finally called me
I ran straightthrough the lobby, I couldn't keep you waiting

[Pre-Chorus]
And I know, and I know, and I know, and I know
That you like your space with your one roommate
Do you mind if I see you tomorrow?
Yeah, I know, yeah, I know, yeah, I know, yeah, I know
That you work Sundays for minimum wage
Should I have known that you would take hold and never let go?
Never let go

[Chorus]
I think I might push my luck with you
Does another night feel alright to you?
If I ask right now, would you think it through? 
I think I might push my luck with you
Did you say that you got nothing else to do?
Is it okay if I stay? 'Cause I'm dying to
Yeah, I'm dying to

[Verse 2]
Restless, tangled up in your mattress
In the morning, we'll get dressed, the one that got away
You caught me 
Yeah, I'm right where you want me
Every inch of my body won't let this go to waste

[Pre-Chorus]
And I know, and I know, and I know, and I know
That you like your space with your one roommate
Should I have known that you would take hold and never let go?
Never let go

[Chorus]
I think I might push my luck with you
Does another night feel alright to you?
If I ask right now, would you think it through? 
I think I might push my luck with you
Did you say that you got nothing else to do?
Is it okay if I stay? 'Cause I'm dying to
Yeah, I'm dying to

[Drop]

I think I might push my
Does another night feel al
If I ask right now, would

[Chorus]
I think I might push my luck with you
Does another night feel alright to you?
If I ask right now, would you think it through? 
I think I might push my luck with you
Did you say that you got nothing else to do?
Is it okay if I stay? 'Cause I'm dying to
Yeah, I'm dying to

[Verse 1]
You don't gotta say it, I know you ain't stayin' over
And I won't even mention the fact that you're never sober
I never know which side I'm gonna get tonight
And the closer we get, the less I think I know you

[Chorus]
But you're just my type
The kind that only calls me late at night
You can't decide if you'll be yours or mine
I hate to say it, but you're just my type
Yeah, you're just my type, yeah, yeah

[Hook/Drop]
Just my type
Yeah, you're just my type, yeah, yeah
Just my type
Yeah, you're just my type, yeah, yeah

[Verse 2]
And I'm foolin' myself, 'cause I know that I'll never change ya
But you told me the truth, so I guess I can't really blame ya
No, you're not the one, but you're all I want, yeah
People say I'll get hurt, I don't know what they're so afraid of

[Chorus]
But you're just my type
The kind that only calls me late at night
You can't decide if you'll be yours or mine
I hate to say it, but you're just my type
Yeah, you're just my type, yeah, yeah

[Hook/Drop]
Just my type
Yeah, you're just my type, yeah, yeah
Just my type
Yeah, you're just my type, yeah, yeah

[Chorus]

The kind that only calls me late at night
You can't decide if you'll be yours or mine
I hate to say it, but you're just my type
Yeah, you're just my type, yeah, yeah

[Hook/Drop]
Yeah, you're just my type 
Just my type, yeah, yeah

Yeah, you're just my type, yeah, yeah

[Outro]
My type
Oh, I hate to say it, but you're just my type
My type
Oh, I hate to say it, but you're just my type

[Verse 1]
Bend your chest open so I can read your heart
I need to get inside, or I'll start a war
Wanna look at the pieces that make you who you are
I wanna build you up and take you apart

[Chorus]
Let me see the dark sides as well as the bright
I'm gonna love you inside out
I'm gonna love you inside out
Let me see the dark sides as well as the bright
I'm gonna love you inside out
I'm gonna love you inside out

[Post-Chorus]
I'm gonna love you in...
I'm gonna love you
I'm gonna love you

[Verse 2]
I'm gonna pick your brain and get to know your thoughts
So I can read your mind when you don't wanna talk
And can I touch your face before you go?
I collect your scales, but you don't have to know

[Chorus]
Let me see the dark sides as well as the bright
I'm gonna love you inside out
I'm gonna love you inside out
Let me see the dark sides as well as the bright
I'm gonna love you inside out
I'm gonna love you inside out

[Post-Chorus]
I'm gonna love you in...
I'm gonna love you
I'm gonna love you

[Outro]
I'm gonna love you inside out

I'm gonna love you inside out
I'm gonna love you inside out
Inside out

I'm gonna love, I'm gonna love you inside out
Ou-ou-ou-out, ou-ou-ou-out

Ou-ou-ou-out, ou-ou-ou-out

Ou-ou-ou-out, ou-ou-ou-out
[Verse 1]
I know as the night goes on
You might end up with someone
So why do I bite my tongue?
Oh, I wanna know ya
I'm lookin' around the room
Is one of those strangers you?
And do you notice me too?
Oh, I wanna know ya

[Pre-Chorus]
 You're a face I won't forget
 Don't know how much time is left
 Haven't had a moment yet
Ooh

[Chorus]
Oh, dance with me, it won't kill ya
And one for the road
Dance with me, it won't kill ya
And one before you go
Dance with me, it won't kill ya
And one for the road
So why won't you stay a little longer?

[Hook]
Dance with me
Dance with me


[Verse 2]
You're putting your jacket on
Oh no, is the moment gone?
Don't wanna regret this one
Ooh, I wanna know ya

[Pre-Chorus]
 You're a face I won't forget
 Don't know how much time is left
 Haven't had a moment yet
Ooh

[Chorus]
Oh, dance with me, it won't kill ya
And one for the road
Dance with me, it won't kill ya
And one before you go
Dance with me, it won't kill ya
And one for the road
So why won't you stay a little longer?

[Hook]
Dance with me

Dance with me


[Bridge]
I know as the night goes on
You might end up with someone
So why do I bite my tongue?
Ooh, I wanna know ya

[Chorus]
Oh, dance with me, it won't kill ya
And one for the road
Dance with me, it won't kill ya
And one before you go
Dance with me, it won't kill ya
And one for the road
So why won't you stay a little longer?

[Hook]
So why don't you stay a little longer?
So why don't you stay a little longer?
Woah, woah, yeah
So why don't you stay a little longer?

[Outro]
So why don't you stay a little longer?
[Verse 1]
You end up alone after all that you've done
All that you paid for
Did you get what you wanted?
You loaded a gun with all you were made of
When you're alone
People don't think you know what you're made of, oh
Are you better than me?
It's not up to say it's all that you wait for
Now I'll find a way
I'm seeing it through, can you not be hateful
While we're alive
Can we relax that, that what our maids for?

[Chorus]
You were there for me, and I was there for you
How will I let you go?
You will always be the one that I regret
How will I let you go?

[Verse 2]
You're here in the way
How could you stay after that I paid for
Leave any time, won't let you wait
How could you be assured?
You're holding out hope
I'm seeing it, too, I'm trying to follow
I've been through hell and back again
I've come to understand that when
You tell me that I can't pretend
I either care about your stuff
Make the most of the things that might be rough
I let you go

[Pre-Chorus]
Holding out hope for you
Holding out hope, holding out hope for you

[Chorus]
You were there for me, and I was there for you
How will I let you go?
You will always be the one that I regret
How will I let you go?  

[Post-Chorus]
Let you go, let you go
Let you go, let you go

[Pre-Chorus]
Holding out hope for you
Holding out hope, holding out hope for you

[Chorus 2]
You were there for me, and I was there for you
I remember times like that
You will always be the one that I regret
How will I let you go?

[Post-Chorus]
Let you go, let you go
Let you go, let you go

[Verse 1]
Made plans with me and all your friends
I'm late again, I hate to keep you waiting
Tried to be a gentleman, got drunk again before I even made it
Tried to call a car for you, you're tired of me
I know you wouldn't take it
You walked a mile in Louis Vuittons and fucked 'em up
You know that they're my favorite

[Pre-Chorus]
But we dress up and play pretend
Then we act like we're good again
I do things I can't defend
And even when you hold it in

[Chorus]
Hold it, even though it kills you slowly
Explosions hidden when we're in the open
Keep on smilin' until it's over
Hold it, even though it kills you slowly

[Verse 2]
Arguments that never end
You're talkin' shit to spice up conversation
I'm so sick of back and forth
These fights with you are startin' to feel contagious
Said that I'm no good for you
Right before we walk into your parents
Then you put on that smile again
And grab my hand even though you hate it

[Pre-Chorus]
But we dress up and play pretend
Then we act like we're good again
I do things I can't defend
And even when you hold it in

[Chorus]
Hold it, even though it kills you slowly
Explosions hidden when we're in the open
Keep on smilin' until it's over
Hold it, even though it kills you slowly

[Post-Chorus]
Oh, but, but it, it won't, but I said
You hold on, hopin' it gon' stop, but it don't
Oh, but, but it, it won't, but I said
You hold on, hopin' it gon' stop, but it don't

[Bridge]
Hold it, even though it kills you slowly
Explosions hidden when we're in the open
And keep on smilin' until it's over
Hold it, even though it kills you slowly

[Chorus]
Hold it, even though it kills you slowly
(Oh, but, but it, it won't, but I said
You hold on, hopin' it gon' stop, but it don't)
Explosions hidden when we're in the open
(Oh, but, but it, it won't, but I said
You hold on, hopin' it gon' stop, but it don't)
Keep on smilin' until it's over
(Oh, but, but it, it won't, but I said
You hold on, hopin' it gon' stop, but it don't)
Hold it, even though it kills you slowly
(Oh, but, but it, it won't, but I said
You hold on, hopin' it gon' stop, but it don't)

[Verse 1]
Droppin' bombs in cups of coffee
You said it hit you all at once
I'm already tired and it's still mornin'
Then you clear your throat
Deep down I know that this is done
You tell me you're sorry and I'm laughin'
You say sometimes these things just don't work out
'Cause you're only human, this shit happens
Wait, I don't mean to stop you
But darlin', I have to cut you off

[Chorus]
Don't say, don't say you're human
Don't say, don't say it's not your fault
I won't take the bait or these excuses that you're usin'
Don't say, don't say you're human

[Hook]
Don't say, don't say
Don't say, don't say
Don't say you're human

[Verse 2]
Say you regret the way you acted
Come on, admit you let me down
Say that I'm better in your absence
Go right ahead, say almost anything you want

[Chorus]
Just don't say, don't say you're human
Don't say, don't say it's not your fault
I won't take the bait or these excuses that you're usin'
Don't say, don't say you're human

[Hook]
Don't say, don't say
Don't say, don't say
Don't say you're human

[Chorus]
Don't say, don't say you're human
Don't say, don't say it's not your fault
I won't take the bait or these excuses that you're usin'
Don't say, don't say you're human
Just don't say, don't say you're human
Don't say, don't say it's not your fault
I won't take the bait or these excuses that you're usin'
Don't say, don't say you're human, oh

[Hook]
Don't say, don't say
Don't say, don't say
Don't say you're human

[Outro]
No way, no way you're human

Okay, before you forget it, go
Okay, qualms, qualms
Qualms, qualms, qualms, qualms

Thank you, goodnight!

[Chorus]
Run into the bright lights most nights, now or never
Always and forever the last day alive
The last day alive

[Verse 1]
Bottled up in adolescence
Bottom up forbidden essence
Twisted up in adolescence
Waking up within your arms
I feel alive and dangerous
You're dangerous, we're dangerous

[Chorus]
Run into the bright lights most nights, now or never
Always and forever the last day alive
The last day alive

[Post-Chorus]
Now or never, it's now or never
Now or never, it's now or never 
Now or never, it's now or never
Now or never, it's now or never
The last day alive

Promises within the air
Drowning in love affair
The night is young and we are young

[Chorus]
Run into the bright lights most nights, now or never

The last day alive

[Verse 1]
Now I got cars, now I got clothes, now I got money
Now I got crowds screamin' my name sayin' they love me
You get real close, say I'm not alone, you understand me
But late at night, when I close my eyes, the quiet scares me

[Pre-Chorus]
Will you still care in the morning?
When the magic's gone, gone, oh?
And will you be there in the morning?
Do you stay when it all goes?
Or will I wake up alone?

[Chorus]
Wake up alone
Wake up alone

[Verse 2]
I don't need cars, I don't need clothes, forget that money
'Cause if I go home all on my own, it ain't worth nothing

[Pre-Chorus]
Will you still care in the morning?
When the magic's gone, gone, oh?
And will you be there in the morning?
Do you stay when it all goes?
Or will I wake up alone?

[Chorus]
Wake up alone
Wake up alone
Wake up alone
Wake up alone

[Pre-Chorus]
Will you still care in the morning?
When the magic's gone, gone, oh?
And will you be there in the morning?
Do you stay when it all goes?
Or will I wake up alone?

[Chorus]
Wake up alone
Wake up alone
Wake up alone
Or will I wake up alone?

Dark days, I'm terrified

You takewhat you want
Then you leave whenyou're done
Pretty face with two sides
So what's it gonna be tonight?

[Chorus: Amy Shark]
I'm in my house in the hills with The Reaper
And I wonder if he knows what I've done
I got the keys and I'm going off the deep end
Doesn't hurt when you're doin' it for fun
Am I in your way-ay-ay? Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
Am I in your way-ay-ay? Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah

[Post-Chorus: Amy Shark]

But she don't really trust anyone

No one's steppin' up to be the one
Am I in your way-ay-ay? Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
Am I in your way-ay-ay? Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah

[Bridge: Amy Shark]

[Verse 1: Drew Taggart]
Welcome home, how's your summer been?
I heard you moved in with your boyfriend in New York
What's his name? I heard he works downtown in finance
Is he just as good at romance as we were?
Okay, enough, P.S. I hope you're happy
I started acting out when you moved on
I tried to call you to eliminate the distance
I cared about you once and always will

[Chorus: Drew Taggart]
And I tried my best, crossed my fingers for the rest
And I will find a way, somehow
To be more than photos to you now
I blame myself for when I was someone else
I might not get over this
But I won't be sad for the sake of it
But I won't be sad for the sake of it
But I won't be sad for the sake of it

But I won't be sad for the sake of it


[Drop: Drew Taggart]
But I won't be sad for the sake of it
(P.S. I hope you're... P.S. I hope...
P.S. I hope you're...)

[Verse 2: Mark Hoppus]
What the hell? I couldn't help but check your phone
Who the fuck is "Drew from home" anyway?
This vacation, you said, "Going home was boring"
Left out that part of the story on your way
I might deserve it, but I can't take it
Maybe I should keep this to myself
'Cause if I'm honest, my record's less than flawless
You know that I get lonely when you're gone

[Chorus: Drew Taggart]
And I tried my best, crossed my fingers for the rest
And I will find a way, somehow
To be more than photos to you now
I blame myself for when I was someone else
I might not get over this
But I won't be sad for the sake of it

But I won't be sad for the sake of it

But I won't be sad for the sake of it

But I won't be sad for the sake of it

P.S. I hope you're...

[Drop: Drew Taggart]
But I won't be sad for the sake of it


But I won't be sad for the sake of it

[Outro]
P.S. I hope you're... P.S. I hope...
P.S. I hope you're... P.S. I hope you're...
P.S. I hope you're... P.S. I hope you're...
P.S. I hope you're...

[Verse 1]
Freely feeling everything
You had me reeling
All along the bottom of the deep sea
Can I shake this feeling?
Can I shake this feeling?

[Pre-Chorus]
Tonight, light a fire
We'll be flying up and higher
Burning bright, taking flight
As we leave all our worries behind
It is something special you have
If you didn't know, but now just

[Chorus]
Make your ass shake like a waterbed
Make your ass shake like a waterbed
Make your ass shake like a waterbed
Make your ass shake like a waterbed

[Verse 2]
Freely feeling everything
You had me reeling
Can I shake this feeling?

[Pre-Chorus]
Tonight, light a fire
We'll be flying up and higher
Burning bright, taking flight
As we leave all our worries behind
It is something special you have
If you didn't know, but now just

[Chorus]
Make your ass shake like a waterbed
Make your ass shake like a waterbed
Make your ass shake like a waterbed
Make your ass shake like a waterbed

[Bridge]
Make your ass shake like a waterbed
Can I shake this feeling?
Can I shake this feeling?
Make your ass shake like a waterbed
Can I shake this feeling?
Can I shake this feeling?

[Final Chorus/Outro]
Can I shake this feeling?
Make your ass shake like a waterbed
Make your ass shake like a waterbed
Can I shake this feeling?
Make your ass shake like a waterbed
Make your ass shake like a waterbed
Can I shake this feeling?

[Verse 1: Drew Taggart]
I go from "Okay, I'm okay" to "I'm not okay" in .2
I go from coolinmy new placeto packin' my suitcase like you
Isaid it over and over that I wouldn't do this
Go find someone new and just fuck my way through this
But no way, oh, no way I'm okay when thinkin' 'bout you

[Pre-Chorus: Drew Taggart & Sabrina Claudio]
You were right when you said it, keep my cards to my chest
And I never let no one know me, I pushed you out
Now I get that you needed just a little more love
And to just see me wide open and breaking down

[Chorus: Drew Taggart & Sabrina Claudio]
When no one's there to listen, I will hear your pain
I know that I was less than, but you know people change
So tell me, what's the difference if we still feel the same?
It takes a little distance to make you see the way

[Post-Chorus: Drew Taggart & Sabrina Claudio]
I go from "Okay, I'm okay" to "I'm not okay"
From "Okay, I'm okay" to "I'm not okay"
From "Okay, I'm okay" to "I'm not okay"
From "Okay, I'm okay" to "I'm not o"
I go from "Okay, I'm okay" to "I'm not okay"
From "Okay, I'm okay" to "I'm not okay"
From "Okay, I'm okay" to "I'm not okay"
From "Okay, I'm okay," "I'm not o," "I'm not o"

[Verse 2: Sabrina Claudio]
Deleted your photos, don't know what I thought it would do
And I know what you're thinkin', that's never something I would do
I wish I could lie, but I'm so not a liar
Been trying to try to pretend that I'm fine
But I just end up lying here, feeling more than I want to

[Pre-Chorus: Sabrina Claudio with Drew Taggart]
You were right when you said it, keep my cards to my chest
And I never let no one know me, I pushed you out
Now I get that you needed just a little more love
And to just see me wide open and breaking down

[Chorus: Drew Taggart & Sabrina Claudio]
When no one's there to listen, I will hear your pain
I know that I was less than, but you know people change
So tell me, what's the difference if we still feel the same?
It takes a little distance to make you see the way

[Post-Chorus: Drew Taggart & Sabrina Claudio]
I go from "Okay, I'm okay" to "I'm not okay"
From "Okay, I'm okay" to "I'm not okay"
From "Okay, I'm okay" to "I'm not okay"
From "Okay, I'm okay" to "I'm not o"
I go from "Okay, I'm okay" to "I'm not okay"
From "Okay, I'm okay" to "I'm not okay"
From "Okay, I'm okay" to "I'm not okay"
From "Okay, I'm okay," "I'm not o," "I'm not o"

[Outro: Sabrina Claudio]
Okay, I'm okay, I'm okay, I'm okay
I'm okay, I'm okay, I'm okay, I'm okay
I'm okay, I'm okay, I'm okay, I'm okay
I'm okay, I'm okay, I'm okay, I'm okay

[Intro]
You had one job!

[Verse 1]
Woke up on the West side
Listening to Beach House, taking my time
She's just my type
Dark hair, wavin out the passenger side
Then I start to think
As she pulls me on the bathroom floor
This is my type of thing, yeah yeah

[Chorus]
Oh, darling of mine, where have you been?
I feel so alive with you in my bed
Oh, darling of mine, please don't let go
Just tell me you feel this, tell me you know
Oh, darling of mine

[Drop]
Oh, darling of mine

[Verse 2]
On a train through Japan
I keep her real close 'cause she knows who I am
Red pill in my hand
Paranoid cutie with a dark past, and
Its that type of thing
When she feels like the girl next door
This is my type of thing, yeah yeah

[Chorus]
Oh, darling of mine, where have you been?
I feel so alive with you in my bed
Oh, darling of mine, please don't let go
Just tell me you feel this, tell me you know
Oh, darling of mine

[Drop]
Oh, darling of mine
Where have you been?
Where have you been?
Where have you been?
Where have you been?

[Verse 3]
And then I start to think as I lift her on the sink
That I've been here before
It's a certain type of fling, she gets bored of everything
Not the type you can ignore
Yeah, I just want a taste as she grabs me by the waist
As she closes the door
She's taking what she wants, baby, you can have it all

[Chorus]
Oh, darling of mine, where have you been? 
I feel so alive with you in my bed 
Oh, darling of mine, please don't let go 
Just tell me you feel this, tell me you know
Oh, darling of mine

[Drop]
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Where have you been?
Where have you been?
Where have you been?
Where have you been?
Oh, darling of mine

[Verse 1: Andrew Taggart]
Hey, I was doing just fine before I met you
I drink too much
And that's an issue, but I'm okay
Hey, you tell your friends
It was nice to meet them
But I hope I never see them again

[Pre-Chorus: Wiz Khalifa]
I know it breaks your heart
That I only smoke papers, cause I dont smoke 'gars, babe
Im at an old school car take a joint to the face
And we both go far
Get high, cant stop
Lets get high, we cant stop
No

[Chorus: Andrew Taggart]
So, baby, pull me closer
In the backseat of your Rover
That I know you can't afford
Bite that tattoo on your shoulder
Pull the sheets right off the corner
Of the mattress that you stole
From your roommate back in Boulder
We ain't ever getting older

[Post-Chorus: Andrew Taggart & Wiz Khalifa]
We ain't ever getting older
Khalifa man
We ain't ever getting older

[Verse 2: Wiz Khalifa]
Khalifa man, I'm fresh off of the plane
Been smoking so long I got my own strain
Roll up a joint and take it to the brain
Say you're getting high, but now you're speaking my language
Left with me as soon as we came
Spoke some bullshit, she'll never do it again
Try anything, she'll never do it again
Fuck Khalifa man, 'cos you'll never do it again

[Pre-Chorus: Wiz Khalifa]
I know it breaks your heart
That I only smoke papers, cause I dont smoke 'gars, babe
Im at an old school car take a joint to the face
And we both go far
And get high, cant stop
Lets get high, we cant stop
No

[Chorus: Andrew Taggart & Halsey]
So, baby, pull me closer
In the backseat of your Rover
That I know you can't afford
Bite that tattoo on your shoulder
Pull the sheets right off the corner
Of the mattress that you stole
From your roommate back in Boulder
We ain't ever getting older

[Post-Chorus: Andrew Taggart & Halsey]
We ain't ever getting older
We ain't ever getting older

[Chorus: Andrew Taggart]
So, baby, pull me closer
In the backseat of your Rover
That I know you can't afford
Bite that tattoo on your shoulder
Pull the sheets right off the corner
Of the mattress that you stole
From your roommate back in Boulder
We ain't ever getting older

[Post-Chorus: Andrew Taggart & Halsey]
We ain't ever getting older

We ain't ever getting older

We ain't ever getting older

We ain't ever getting older


[Intro]
I need you right now

[Verse 1]
Crashing, hit a wall
Right now I need a miracle
Hurry up now, I need a miracle
Stranded, reaching out
I call your name, but you're not around
I say your name, but you're not around

[Chorus]
I need you, I need you, I need you right now
Yeah, I need you right now
So don't let me, don't let me, don't let me down
I think I'm losing my mind now
It's in my head, darling, I hope
That you'll be here, when I need you the most
So don't let me, don't let me, don't let me down
D-don't let me down

[Post-Chorus]
Don't let me down
So don't let me down, don't let me down, don't let me down

[Verse 2]
R-r-running out of time
I really thought you were on my side
But now there's nobody by my side

[Chorus]
I need you, I need you, I need you right now
Yeah, I need you right now
So don't let me, don't let me, don't let me down
I think I'm losing my mind now
It's in my head, darling, I hope
That you'll be here, when I need you the most
So don't let me, don't let me, don't let me down
D-don't let me down
Yeah, don't let me down

[Post-Chorus]
Don't let me down
Don't let me down
Say don't let me down
Don't let me down
Don't let me down

[Verse 1: BullySongs]
I got something to say
A confession of me
I've been led astray
Tried so hard to change
But I'm set on my ways
My words mean nothing again

[Chorus: BullySongs]
I promised I'd be good
But I can't help myself from these temptations
When they call, there's nothing I can do
I promised I'd be good
The road to hell is paved with good intentions
So when I fall, I will fall to you

[Post-Chorus: BullySongs]
I promised I'd be
I promised I'd be good

[Verse 2: BullySongs]
I just couldn't resist
It was the moment of bliss
I know it's hard to forgive
It's too late for changes
All this time I've wasted
Words mean nothing, nothing again

[Chorus: BullySongs]
I promised I'd be good
But I can't help myself from these temptations
When they call, there's nothing I can do
I promised I'd be good
The road to hell is paved with good intentions
So when I fall, I will fall to you

[Post-Chorus: BullySongs]
I promised I'd be
I promised I'd be good

[Chorus: BullySongs]
I promised I'd be good
But I can't help myself from these temptations
When they come, there's nothing I can do
I promised I'd be good
The road to hell is paved with good intentions
So when I fall, I will fall to you

[Chorus: BullySongs]
I promised I'd be good
But I can't help myself from these temptations
When they call, there's nothing I can do
I promised I'd be good
The road to hell is paved with good intentions
So when I fall, I will fall to you

[Verse 1: Juice WRLD]
Sometimes life brings me to my knees
Drowns me in my misery
Cuts me deep, makes me bleed
I'm ten feet at the cemetery
Maybe it's all in my head, yeah
Maybe I just need rest, yeah
Lately I've been stressed, trynna impress
The whole world
I'm lost in a cold world

[Chorus: Andrew Taggart]
'Cause every night
I convince myself it's all in my head
Maybe none of this is real life
Or maybe I'm just not feeling it yet
So every time
I hear the voices scream inside of my head
I let 'em know if this is real life
We're on our own, so we better be friends

[Drop: Juice WRLD]
Oh, ah, ah
Oh, ah, ah

[Verse 2: Juice WRLD]
Will I see better days? I don't know
Bet you've never seen a frown like this before
I was told to always look at things a little different
See my demons through kaleidoscopes
Here goes some advice I found
Say it with me, scream it loud
Don't let nothing bring you down
And down, and down

[Chorus: Andrew Taggart]
'Cause every night
I convince myself it's all in my head
Maybe none of this is real life
Or maybe I'm just not feeling it yet
So every time
I hear the voices scream inside of my head
I let 'em know if this is real life
We're on our own, so we better be friends

[Drop: Juice WRLD]
Oh, ah, ah
Oh, ah, ah
Oh, ah, ah
Oh, ah, ah

[Chorus: Andrew Taggart]
Cause every night
I convince myself its all in my head
Maybe none of this is real life
Or maybe Im just not feeling it yet
So every time
I hear the voices scream inside of my head
I let em know if this is real life
Were on our own, so we better be friends

[Drop: Juice WRLD]
Oh, ah, ah
Oh, ah, ah
Oh, ah, ah
Oh, ah, ah

[Intro: Juice WRLD]
Tell me where you wanna go

[Pre-Chorus: Juice WRLD]
Tell me where you wanna go
My heart falls to the floor
Time flies when we have fun
30 times six, it's been six months
Uh, and it's just begun
And it's just begun
I think you're the one
What if I'm wrong?

[Chorus: Juice WRLD]
I don't give a fuck about what-ifs
If that ain't love baby, tell me what is 
And these drugs ain't strong as your touch
Let me make love to ya

[Verse 2: Juice WRLD]
It's a vibe alright, it's a vibe
Feeling high alright, off your vibe
It's a vibe alright, it's a vibe
Feeling high off you, off your vibe 
Sit the bullshit straight to the side
Our future is for me and for you to decide
You can see the truth when you look in my eyes, even though sometimes my tongue lies

[Chorus: Juice WRLD]
I don't give a fuck about what-ifs
If that ain't love baby, tell me what is 
And these drugs ain't strong as your touch
Let me make love to ya
I don't give a fuck about what-ifs
If that ain't love baby, tell me what is 
And these drugs ain't strong as your touch
Let me make love to ya

[Verse 3: Andrew Taggart]
I wake up all alone
Tequila on an empty stomach
See I'm addicted to my phone
That's a truth but I run from it 
She said she better on her own
I said I know what that feels like 
She had me on the ropes
Yeah I was hanging on for dear life 

[Chorus: Andrew Taggart & Juice WRLD]
I don't give a fuck about what-ifs
If that ain't love baby, tell me what is 
And these drugs ain't strong as your touch
Let me make love to ya
I don't give a fuck about what-ifs 
If that ain't love baby, tell me what is 
And these drugs ain't strong as your touch
Let me make love to ya

[Outro: Juice WRLD & Andrew Taggart]
Tell me where you wanna go
My heart falls to the floor
Time flies when we have fun
30 times six, it's been six months
Uh, and it's just begun
And it's just begun
I think you're the one
What if I'm wrong?
Yeah, ooh
Yeah, ooh
Yeah, ooh
Yeah[Refrain]
They know what is what
But they don't know what is what
They just strut
What the fuck?

[Verse 1: Katy Perry]
A tiger
Don't lose no sleep
Don't need opinions
From a shellfish or a sheep
Don't you come for me
No, not today
You're calculated
I got your number
'Cause you're a joker
And I'm a courtside killer queen
And you will kiss the ring
You best believe

[Pre-Chorus: Katy Perry]
So keep calm, honey, I'ma stick around
For more than a minute, get used to it
Funny my name keeps comin' outcho mouth
'Cause I stay winning
Lay 'em up like

[Chorus: Katy Perry]
Swish, swish, bish
Another one in the basket
Can't touch this
Another one in the casket

[Verse 2: Katy Perry]
Your game is tired
You should retire
You're 'bout cute as
An old coupon expired
And karma's not a liar
She keeps receipts

[Pre-Chorus: Katy Perry]
So keep calm, honey, I'ma stick around
For more than a minute, get used to it
Funny my name keeps comin' outcho mouth
'Cause I stay winning
Lay 'em up like

[Chorus: Katy Perry]
Swish, swish, bish
Another one in the basket
Can't touch this
Another one in the casket
Swish, swish, bish
Another one in the basket
Can't touch this
Another one in the casket

They just strut
Hahaha, yo

[Verse 3: Nicki Minaj]
Pink Ferragamo sliders on deck
Silly rap beefs just get me more checks
My life is a movie, I'm never off set
Me and my amigos 
Swish swish, aww I got them upset
But my shooters'll make 'em dance like dubstep
Swish, swish, aww, my haters is obsessed
'Cause I make M's, they get much less
Don't be tryna double back
I already despise you
All that fake love you showin'
Couldn't even disguise you
Ran? When? Nicki gettin' tan
Mirror mirror who's the fairest bitch in all the land?
Damn, man, this bitch is a Stan
Muah, muah, the generous queen will kiss a fan
Ass goodbye, I'ma be riding by
I'ma tell my ----- Biggz, yeah that's tha guy
A star's a star, da ha da ha
They never thought the swish god would take it this far
Get my pimp cup, this is pimp shit, baby
I only rock with Queens, so I'm makin' hits with Katy

[Chorus: Katy Perry]
Swish, swish, bish
Another one in the basket
Can't touch this
Another one in the casket

What the...

[Verse 1: Katy Perry]
Are we crazy?
Living our lives through a lens
Trapped in our white picket fence
Like ornaments
So comfortable, we're living in a bubble, bubble
So comfortable, we cannot see the trouble, trouble
Aren't you lonely
Up there in utopia
Where nothing will ever be enough?
Happily numb
So comfortable, we're living in a bubble, bubble
So comfortable, we cannot see the trouble, trouble

[Pre-Chorus: Katy Perry]
So put your rose-colored glasses on
And party on

[Chorus: Katy Perry]
Turn it up, it's your favorite song
Dance, dance, dance to the distortion
Come on, turn it up, keep it on repeat
Stumbling around like a wasted zombie
Yeah, we think we're free
Drink, this one is on me
We're all chained to the rhythm
To the rhythm
To the rhythm
Turn it up, it's your favorite song
Dance, dance, dance to the distortion
Come on, turn it up, keep it on repeat
Stumbling around like a wasted zombie
Yeah, we think we're free
Drink, this one is on me
We're all chained to the rhythm
To the rhythm
To the rhythm

[Verse 2: Katy Perry]
Are we tone deaf?
Keep sweeping it under the mat
Thought we could do better than that
I hope we can
So comfortable, we're living in a bubble, bubble
So comfortable, we cannot see the trouble, trouble

[Pre-Chorus: Katy Perry]
So put your rose-colored glasses on
And party on

[Chorus: Katy Perry]
Turn it up, it's your favorite song
Dance, dance, dance to the distortion
Come on, turn it up, keep it on repeat
Stumbling around like a wasted zombie
Yeah, we think we're free
Drink, this one is on me
We're all chained to the rhythm
To the rhythm
To the rhythm
Turn it up, it's your favorite song
Dance, dance, dance to the distortion
Come on, turn it up, keep it on repeat
Stumbling around like a wasted zombie
Yeah, we think we're free
Drink, this one is on me
We're all chained to the rhythm
To the rhythm
To the rhythm

[Bridge: Skip Marley]
It is my desire
Break down the walls to connect, inspire
Ay, up in your high place, liars
Time is ticking for the empire
The truth they feed is feeble
As so many times before
They greed over the people
They stumbling and fumbling
And we're about to riot
They woke up, they woke up the lions


[Chorus: Katy Perry]
Turn it up, it's your favorite song
Dance, dance, dance to the distortion
Come on, turn it up, keep it on repeat
Stumbling around like a wasted zombie
Yeah, we think we're free
Drink, this one is on me
We're all chained to the rhythm
To the rhythm
To the rhythm

[Outro: Katy Perry]
Turn it up
Turn it up
It goes on, and on, and on
It goes on, and on, and on
It goes on, and on, and on
'Cause we're all chained to the rhythm

[Intro: Juicy J]
Yeah, ya'll know what it is
Katy Perry, Juicy J
Uh-huh, let's rage!

[Verse 1: Katy Perry]
I knew you were, you were gonna come to me
And here you are, but you better choose carefully
'Cause I, I'm capable of anything
Of anything, and everything
Make me your Aphrodite
Make me your one and only
But don't make me your enemy 
Your enemy , your enemy

[Chorus: Katy Perry]
So you wanna play with magic?
Boy, you should know what you're fallin' for
Baby, do you dare to do this?
'Cause I'm coming at you like a dark horse
Are you ready for, ready for
A perfect storm, perfect storm?
'Cause once you're mine, once you're mine
There's no going back

[Verse 2: Katy Perry]
Mark my words, this love will make you levitate
Like a bird, like a bird without a cage
We're down to earth if you choose to walk away
Don't walk away 
It's in the palm of your hand now, baby
It's a yes or a no, no maybe
So just be sure before you give it all to me
All to me, give it all to me

[Chorus: Katy Perry]
So you wanna play with magic?
Boy, you should know what you're fallin' for
Baby, do you dare to do this?
'Cause I'm coming at you like a dark horse
Are you ready for, ready for
A perfect storm, perfect storm?
'Cause once you're mine, once you're mine
There's no going back

[Verse 3: Juicy J]
She's a beast, I call her Karma 
She eat your heart out like Jeffrey Dahmer 
Be careful, try not to lead her on
Shawty's heart is on steroids, 'cause her love is so strong
You may fall in love when you meet her 
If you get the chance, you better keep her 
She's sweet as pie, but if you break her heart
She turn cold as a freezer 
That fairy tale ending with a knight in shining armor
She can be my sleeping beauty, I'm gon' put her in a coma 
Damn, I think I love her, shawty's so bad, I'm sprung and I don't care
She ride me like a roller coaster, turn the bedroom into a fair 
Her love is like a drug, I was tryna hit it and quit it
But lil mama so dope, I messed around and got addicted

[Chorus: Katy Perry]
So you wanna play with magic?
Boy, you should know what you're fallin' for 
Baby, do you dare to do this?
'Cause I'm coming at you like a dark horse 
Are you ready for, ready for 
A perfect storm, perfect storm? 
'Cause once you're mine, once you're mine
There's no going back

It'll change your mind 
Got you running back for seconds 
Every single night

[Verse 4: Takeoff]
I'm the one they say can change your life 
No waterfall, she drippin' wet, you like my ice? 
She say she want a Migo night
Now I ask her, "What's the price?" 
If she do right, told her get whatever you like

[Verse 5: Offset]
Offset
I grab her legs and now divide, aight
Make her do a donut when she ride, aight
Looking at the eyes of a dime, make you blind
In her spine and my diamonds change the climate

[Verse 6: Quavo & Katy Perry]
Sweet tooth, no tooth fairy
Whipped cream, no dairy
Got her hot light on, screaming, "I'm ready"
But no horses, no carriage

Under candlelight 
Bon apptit, baby

[Verse 1]
I used to bite my tongue and hold my breath
Scared to rock the boat and make a mess
So I sat quietly, agreed politely
I guess that I forgot I had a choice
I let you push me past the breaking point
I stood for nothing, so I fell for everything

[Pre-Chorus]
You held me down, but I got up 
Already brushing off the dust
You hear my voice, your hear that sound
Like thunder, gonna shake the ground
You held me down, but I got up 
Get ready cause I had enough
I see it all, I see it now

[Chorus]
I got the eye of the tiger, a fighter
Dancing through the fire
'Cause I am a champion, and youre gonna hear me roar
Louder, louder than a lion
'Cause I am a champion, and youre gonna hear me roar

[Post-Chorus]
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Youre gonna hear me roar

[Verse 2]
Now Im floating like a butterfly
Stinging like a bee I earned my stripes
I went from zero, to my own hero

[Pre-Chorus]
You held me down, but I got up 
Already brushing off the dust
You hear my voice, you hear that sound
Like thunder, gonna shake the ground
You held me down, but I got up 
Get ready 'cause I had enough
I see it all, I see it now

[Chorus]
I got the eye of the tiger, a fighter
Dancing through the fire
'Cause I am a champion, and youre gonna hear me roar
Louder, louder than a lion

[Verse 1]
I'm losing my self control
Yeah, youre starting to trickle back in
But I don't wanna fall down the rabbit hole
Cross my heart, I won't do it again

[Pre-Chorus]
I tell myself, tell myself, tell myself, "Draw the line"
And I do, I do
But once in a while, I trip up, and I cross the line
And I think of you

[Chorus]
Two years, and just like that
My head still takes me back
Thought it was done, but I
Guess its never really over
Oh, we were such a mess
But wasn't it the best?
Thought it was done, but I
Guess it's never really over

[Post-Chorus]
Just because it's over doesn't mean it's really over
And if I think it over, maybe you'll be coming over again
And I'll have to get over you all over again
Just because its over doesnt mean it's really over
And if I think it over, maybe youll be coming over again
And I'll have to get over you all over again

[Verse 2]
I guess I could try hypnotherapy
I gotta rewire this brain
'Cause I can't even go on the internet
Without even checking your name

[Pre-Chorus]
I tell myself, tell myself, tell myself, "Draw the line"
And I do, I do
But once in a while, I trip up, and I cross the line
I think of you

[Chorus]
Two years, and just like that
My head still takes me back
Thought it was done, but I
Guess its never really over
Oh, we were such a mess
But wasn't it the best?
Thought it was done, but I
Guess it's never really over

[Post-Chorus]
Just because it's over doesn't mean it's really over
And if I think it over, maybe you'll be coming over again
And I'll have to get over you all over again
Just because it's over doesn't mean it's really over
And if I think it over, maybe you'll be coming over again
And I'll have to get over you all over again

[Bridge]
Thought we kissed goodbye
Thought we meant this time was the last
But I guess it's never really over
Thought we drew the line right through you and I
Can't keep going back
I guess it's never really over, yeah

[Chorus]
Two years, and just like that
My head still takes me back
Thought it was done, but I
Guess it's never really over

[Post-Chorus]
Just because it's over doesn't mean it's really over
And if I think it over, maybe you'll be coming over again
And I'll have to get over you all over again

Just because it's over doesn't mean it's really over
And if I think it over, maybe you'll be coming over again
And I'll have to get over you all over again


[Outro]
Thought we kissed goodbye
Thought we meant this time was the last
But I guess it's never really over
Thought we drew the line right through you and I
Can't keep going back
I guess it's never really over

[Verse 1]
Do you ever feel like a plastic bag
Drifting through the wind, wanting to start again?
Do you ever feel, feel so paper-thin
Like a house of cards, one blow from caving in?
Do you ever feel already buried deep?
Six feet under screams, but no one seems to hear a thing
Do you know that there's still a chance for you?
'Cause there's a spark in you

[Pre-Chorus]
You just gotta ignite the light
And let it shine
Just own the night
Like the Fourth of July

[Chorus]
'Cause baby, you're a firework
Come on show 'em what you're worth
Make 'em go, "Aah, aah, aah"
As you shoot across the sky
Baby, you're a firework
Come on, let your colors burst
Make 'em go, "Aah, aah, aah"
You're gonna leave them all in awe, awe, awe

[Verse 2]
You don't have to feel like a waste of space
You're original, cannot be replaced
If you only knew what the future holds
After a hurricane comes a rainbow
Maybe a reason why all the doors are closed
So you could open one that leads you to the perfect road
Like a lightning bolt, your heart will glow
And when it's time, you'll know

[Pre-Chorus]
You just gotta ignite the light
And let it shine
Just own the night
Like the Fourth of July

[Chorus]
'Cause baby, you're a firework
Come on, show 'em what you're worth
Make 'em go, "Aah, aah, aah"
As you shoot across the sky
Baby, you're a firework
Come on, let your colors burst
Make 'em go, "Aah, aah, aah"
You're gonna leave them all in awe, awe, awe

[Bridge]
Boom, boom, boom
Even brighter than the moon, moon, moon
It's always been inside of you, you, you
And now it's time to let it through

[Chorus]
'Cause baby, you're a firework
Come on, show 'em what you're worth
Make 'em go, "Aah, aah, aah"
As you shoot across the sky
Baby, you're a firework
Come on, let your colors burst
Make 'em go, "Aah, aah, aah"
You're gonna leave them all in awe, awe, awe

[Outro]
Boom, boom, boom
Even brighter than the moon, moon, moon
Boom, boom, boom
Even brighter than the moon, moon, moon

[Verse 1]
Summer after high school, when we first met
We'd make out in your Mustang to Radiohead
And on my 18th birthday, we got matching tattoos
Used to steal your parents' liquor and climb to the roof
Talk about our future like we had a clue
Never planned that one day I'd be losing you

[Chorus]
In another life, I would be your girl
We'd keep all our promises, be us against the world
In another life, I would make you stay
So I don't have to say you were the one that got away
The one that got away

[Verse 2]
I was June, and you were my Johnny Cash
Never one without the other, we made a pact
Sometimes when I miss you, I put those records on, whoa
Someone said you had your tattoo removed
Saw you downtown, singing the blues
It's time to face the music, I'm no longer your muse

[Chorus]
But in another life, I would be your girl
We'd keep all our promises, be us against the world
In another life, I would make you stay
So I don't have to say you were the one that got away
The one that got away

[Post-Chorus]
The one
The one
The one
The one that got away

[Bridge]
All this money can't buy me a time machine, no
Can't replace you with a million rings, no
I should've told you what you meant to me, whoa
'Cause now I pay the price

[Chorus]
In another life, I would be your girl
We'd keep all our promises, be us against the world
In another life, I would make you stay
So I don't have to say you were the one that got away
The one that got away

[Post-Chorus]
The one 
The one 
The one 
In another life, I would make you stay
So I don't have to say you were the one that got away
The one that got away

[Verse 1]
I won't just survive
Oh, you will see me thrive
Can write my story
I'm beyond the archetype
I won't just conform
No matter how you shake my core
Cause my roots, they run deep, oh

[Pre-Chorus 1]

Don't doubt it, don't doubt it

I know it, I know it

I'll fight it, I'll fight it
I will transform

[Chorus]
When, when the fire's at my feet again
And the vultures all start circling
They're whispering, You're out of time.
But still, I rise
This is no mistake, no accident
When you think the final nail is in; think again
Don't be surprised, I will still rise

[Verse 2]
I must stay conscious
Through the madness and chaos
So I call on my angels
They say...

[Pre-Chorus 2]

Don't doubt it, don't doubt it

You know it, you know it
And you will not negotiate
Just fight it, just fight it
And be transformed

[Chorus]
Cause when, when the fire's at my feet again
And the vultures all start circling
They're whispering, You're out of time.
But still, I rise
This is no mistake, no accident
When you think the final nail is in; think again
Don't be surprised, I will still rise

[Outro]

Oh, oh, oh, oh

Still rise

Don't be surprised, I will still rise

[Intro: Kanye West]
I got a dirty mind, I got filthy ways
Im tryna bathe my ape in your Milky Way
Im a legend, I'm irreverent, I be reverend
Ill be so fa-a-a-a-a-ar up
We don't give a fuh-uh-uck
Welcome to the danger zone
Step into the fantasy
You are not invited to the other side of sanity
They callin' me an alien, a big headed astronaut
Maybe it's because ya boy Yeezy get ass a lot

[Verse 1: Katy Perry]
Youre so hypnotizing
Could you be the devil?
Could you be an angel?
Your touch, magnetizing
Feels like I am floating
Leaves my body glowing
They say be afraid
Youre not like the others
Futuristic lover
Different DNA
They dont understand you

[Pre-Chorus: Katy Perry]
You're from a whole 'nother world
A different dimension
You open my eyes
And Im ready to go, lead me into the light

[Chorus: Katy Perry]
Kiss me, ki-ki-kiss me
Infect me with your lovin'
Fill me with your poison
Take me, ta-ta-take me
Wanna be a victim
Ready for abduction
Boy, youre an alien
Your touch, so foreign
Its supernatural
Extraterrestrial

[Verse 2: Katy Perry]
You're so supersonic
Wanna feel your powers
Stun me with your lasers
Your kiss is cosmic
Every move is magic

[Pre-Chorus: Katy Perry]
You're from a whole 'nother world
A different dimension
You open my eyes
And Im ready to go, lead me into the light

[Chorus: Katy Perry]
Kiss me, ki-ki-kiss me
Infect me with your lovin'
Fill me with your poison
Take me, ta-ta-take me
Wanna be a victim
Ready for abduction
Boy, youre an alien
Your touch, so foreign
Its supernatural
Extraterrestrial

[Verse 3: Kanye West]
I know a bar out in Mars
Where they driving spaceships instead of cars
Cop a Prada space suit up out the stars
Getting stupid high straight up out the jars
Pockets on Shrek, rockets on deck
Tell me what's next? Alien sex
I'mma disrobe you
Then I'mma probe you
See I abducted you
So I tell you what to do
I tell you what to do, what to do, what to do

[Chorus: Katy Perry]
Kiss me, ki-ki-kiss me
Infect me with your lovin'
Fill me with your poison
Take me, ta-ta-take me
Wanna be a victim
Ready for abduction
Boy, youre an alien
Your touch, so foreign
Its supernatural
Extraterrestrial
Extraterrestrial
Extraterrestrial

[Outro: Katy Perry]
Boy, youre an alien
Your touch, so foreign
Its supernatural
Extraterrestrial

[Intro: Snoop Dogg]
Greetings, loved ones
Let's take a journey

[Verse 1: Katy Perry]
I know a place where the grass is really greener
Warm, wet and wild
There must be something in the water
Sipping gin and juice
Laying underneath the palm trees 
The boys break their necks
Trying to creep a little sneak peek 

[Pre-Chorus: Katy Perry]
You could travel the world
But nothing comes close to the golden coast
Once you party with us
You'll be falling in love
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

[Chorus: Katy Perry]
California girls, we're unforgettable
Daisy Dukes, bikinis on top
Sun-kissed skin so hot, we'll melt your popsicle
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
California girls, we're undeniable
Fine, fresh, fierce, we got it on lock
West Coast represent, now put your hands up
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

[Verse 2: Katy Perry]
Sex  on the beach
We don't mind sand in our stilettos
We freak in my Jeep *horn honks*
Snoop Doggy Dogg on the stereo, oh-oh

[Pre-Chorus: Katy Perry]
You could travel the world 
But nothing comes close to the golden coast
Once you party with us 
You'll be falling in love
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

[Chorus: Katy Perry & ]
California gurls, we're unforgettable 
Daisy Dukes, bikinis on top
Sun-kissed skin so hot, we'll melt your popsicle
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
California gurls , we're undeniable
Fine, fresh, fierce, we got it on lock
West Coast represent , now put your hands up
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

[Verse 3: Snoop Dogg & Katy Perry, Both]
Toned, tan, fit and ready
Turn it up cause it's getting heavy
Wild, wild, West Coast
These are the girls I love the most
I mean the ones, I mean like she's the one
Kiss her, touch her, squeeze her buns 
The girl's a freak
She drive a Jeep and live on the beach
I'm okay, I won't play
I love the Bay just like I love L.A
Venice Beach and Palm Springs
Summertime is everything
Homeboys banging out
All that ass hanging out
Bikinis, zucchinis, martinis, no weenies
Just the king and a queenie
Katy, my lady 
Lookie here, baby 
I'm all up on ya
'Cause you representing California 

[Chorus: Katy Perry & ]
California gurls, we're unforgettable
Daisy Dukes, bikinis on top
Sun-kissed skin so hot, we'll melt your popsicle
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh 
California gurls, we're undeniable
Fine, fresh, fierce, we got it on lock
West Coast represent 
Now put your hands up 
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

[Outro: Snoop Dogg & ]

California gurls, man
 Hahahaha

I really wish you all could be California gurls

[Verse 1]
This was never the way I planned
Not my intention
I got so brave, drink in hand
Lost my discretion
It's not what I'm used to
Just wanna try you on
I'm curious for you
Caught my attention

[Chorus]
I kissed a girl and I liked it
The taste of her cherry chapstick
I kissed a girl just to try it
I hope my boyfriend don't mind it
It felt so wrong, it felt so right
Don't mean I'm in love tonight
I kissed a girl and I liked it
I liked it

[Verse 2]
No, I don't even know your name
It doesn't matter
You're my experimental game
Just human nature
It's not what good girls do
Not how they should behave
My head gets so confused
Hard to obey

[Chorus]
I kissed a girl and I liked it
The taste of her cherry chapstick
I kissed a girl just to try it
I hope my boyfriend don't mind it
It felt so wrong, it felt so right
Don't mean I'm in love tonight
I kissed a girl and I liked it
I liked it

[Bridge]
Us girls, we are so magical
Soft skin, red lips, so kissable
Hard to resist, so touchable
Too good to deny it
Ain't no big deal, it's innocent

[Chorus]
I kissed a girl and I liked it
The taste of her cherry chapstick
I kissed a girl just to try it
I hope my boyfriend don't mind it
It felt so wrong, it felt so right
Don't mean I'm in love tonight
I kissed a girl and I liked it
I liked it

[Verse 1]
If I lost it all today, would you stay?
Could my love be enough to stimulate?
If shit hit the fan, grenades got thrown
Would you still show, oh?
Could you go down with me to the mat?
Could we get back up and eventually laugh?
Roll eyes at highs, cheers in the lows, and stay in the flow, whoa

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause I, I only got this life
And I ain't got the time, no
Not to get it right, oh

[Chorus]
We're all just looking for connection
Yeah, we all want to be seen
I'm looking for someone who speaks my language
Someone to ride this ride with me
Can I get a witness? 
Will you be my witness? 
I'm just looking for a witness in all of this
Looking for a witness to get me through this

[Verse 2]
When you tell me everything, and there's no holes
You can scroll through anything, you've got the codes
Nothing to hide, it's all in their eyes
And we just know, whoa

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause I, I only got this life
And I ain't got the time, no
Not to get it right, oh

[Chorus]
We're all just looking for connection
Yeah, we all want to be seen
I'm looking for someone who speaks my language
Someone to ride this ride with me
Can I get a witness? 
Will you be my witness? 
I'm just looking for a witness  in all of this 
Looking for a witness to get me through this



[Bridge]
Will you be my witness?
Could you be the one that speaks for me?
Will you be my witness?

[Chorus]
We're all just looking for connection 
Yeah, we all want to be seen
I'm looking for someone who speaks my language
Someone  to ride this ride with me 
Can I get a witness? 
Will you be my witness? 

I'm just looking for a witness in all of this
Looking for a witness to get me through this

[Outro]
Oh-oh-oh-oh 
Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, ooh-ooh
Hey 
Oh-oh-oh
Hey

[Verse 1]
You think I'm pretty without any makeup on
You think I'm funny when I tell the punch line wrong
I know you get me
So I let my walls come down, down
Before you met me
I was alright, but things were kinda heavy
You brought me to life
Now every February, you'll be my Valentine, Valentine

[Pre-Chorus]
Let's go all the way tonight
No regrets, just love
We can dance until we die
You and I, we'll be young forever

[Chorus]
You make me feel like I'm living a teenage dream
The way you turn me on
I can't sleep
Let's run away and don't ever look back
Don't ever look back
My heart stops when you look at me
Just one touch
Now baby, I believe this is real
So take a chance and don't ever look back
Don't ever look back

[Verse 2]
We drove to Cali and got drunk on the beach
Got a motel and built a fort out of sheets
I finally found you, my missing puzzle piece
I'm complete

[Pre-Chorus]
Let's go all the way tonight
No regrets, just love
We can dance until we die
You and I, we'll be young forever

[Chorus]
You make me feel like I'm living a teenage dream
The way you turn me on
I can't sleep
Let's run away and don't ever look back
Don't ever look back
My heart stops when you look at me
Just one touch
Now baby, I believe this is real
So take a chance and don't ever look back
Don't ever look back

[Bridge]
I'mma get your heart racing in my skin-tight jeans
Be your teenage dream tonight
Let you put your hands on me in my skin-tight jeans
Be your teenage dream tonight


[Chorus]

You make me feel like I'm living a teenage dream
The way you turn me on
I can't sleep
Let's run away and don't ever look back
Don't ever look back 
My heart stops when you look at me
Just one touch
Now baby, I believe this is real 
So take a chance and don't ever look back
Don't ever look back

[Outro]
I'mma get your heart racing in my skin-tight jeans
Be your teenage dream tonight
Let you put your hands on me in my skin-tight jeans
Be your teenage dream tonight


[Produced by Dr. Luke, Benny Blanco, and Max Martin]

[Verse 1]
You love the hell out of me
And Heaven's where we could be
I've stood on theedgeof love
But nevertook the leap
And you took myarmor off
And did it delicately
And I let my guard down
To show you what's underneath

[Pre-Chorus]
Thank God that you were man enough to come
Answer my mama's prayers
You asked the question, I said, "Yes"
But I'm scared

[Chorus]
'Cause I've never worn white
But I wanna get it right
Yeah, I really wanna try with you
No, I've never worn white
But I'm standin' here tonight
'Cause I really wanna say "I do"
I do

[Verse 2]
See us in sixty years with a full family tree 
Give my blood, sweat, and tears to reach our destiny 
'Cause love is a minefield, let's take this war, baby 
'Cause at the end of it all, I choose you and you choose me 

[Pre-Chorus]
Thank God I was woman enough to come
Answer your father's prayers
You asked the question
I could tell you were scared

[Chorus]
'Cause I've never worn white
But I wanna get it right
Yeah, I really wanna try with you
No, I've never worn white
But I'm standin' here tonight
'Cause I really wanna say "I do"

[Bridge]
Now let's dance with each other 
Mixing all of our colors
It's so easy to surrender
When you finally find forever

[Chorus]
No, I've never worn white, no
But I really wanna try with you
Yeah, I've never worn white
But I wanna get it right
'Cause I really wanna say "I do"

[Outro]
'Cause I do
Oh, I do, yeah, yeah
I do

[Verse 1]
You change your mind like a girl changes clothes
Yeah, you PMS like a bitch; I would know
And you overthink, always speak cryptically
I should know that you're no good for me

[Chorus]
'Cause you're hot then you're cold
You're yes, then you're no
You're in, then you're out
You're up, then you're down
You're wrong when it's right
It's black and it's white
We fight, we break up
We kiss, we make up
 You don't really wanna stay, no
 But you don't really wanna go, oh
You're hot then you're cold
You're yes, then you're no
You're in, then you're out
You're up, then you're down

[Verse 2]
We used to be just like twins, so in sync
The same energy, now's a dead battery
Used to laugh  'bout nothing 
Now you're plain  boring 
I should know  that you're not gonna change

[Chorus]
'Cause you're hot then you're cold
You're yes, then you're no
You're in, then you're out
You're up, then you're down
You're wrong when it's right
It's black and it's white
We fight, we break up
We kiss, we make up
 You don't really wanna stay, no
 But you don't really wanna go, oh
You're hot then you're cold
You're yes, then you're no
You're in, then you're out
You're up, then you're down

[Bridge]
Someone call the doctor
Got a case of a love bipolar
Stuck on a roller coaster
Can't get off this ride
You change your mind like a girl changes clothes

[Chorus]
'Cause you're hot then you're cold
You're yes, then you're no
You're in, then you're out
You're up, then you're down
You're wrong when it's right
It's black and it's white
We fight, we break up
We kiss, we make up
You're hot then you're cold
You're yes, then you're no
You're in, then you're out
You're up, then you're down
You're wrong when it's right
It's black and it's white
We fight, we break up
We kiss, we make up
 You don't really wanna stay, no
 But you don't really wanna go, oh
You're hot then you're cold
You're yes, then you're no
You're in, then you're out
You're up, then you're down

[Verse 1]
I heard you're feeling nothing's going right
Why don't you let me stop by?
The clock is ticking, running out of time
So we should party all night

[Pre-Chorus 1]
So cover your eyes, I have a surprise
I hope you got a healthy appetite
If you wanna dance, if you want it all
You know that I'm the girl that you should call

[Chorus]
Boy, when you're with me, I'll give you a taste
Make it like your birthday every day
I know you like it sweet, so you can have your cake
Give you something good to celebrate

[Post-Chorus]
So make a wish
I'll make it like your birthday every day
I'll be your gift
Give you something good to celebrate

[Verse 2]
Pop your confetti, pop your Prignon
So hot and heavy 'til dawn
I got you spinning like a disco ball
All night they're playing your song

[Pre-Chorus 2]
We're living the life, we're doing it right 
You're never gonna be unsatisfied
If you wanna dance, if you want it all 
You know that I'm the girl that you should call 

[Chorus]
Boy, when you're with me, I'll give you a taste
Make it like your birthday every day
I know you like it sweet, so you can have your cake
Give you something good to celebrate

[Post-Chorus]
So make a wish
I'll make it like your birthday every day
I'll be  your gift 
Give you something good to celebrate

[Bridge]
Happy birthday
So let me get you in your birthday suit
It's time to bring out the big balloons 
So let me get you in your birthday suit
It's time to bring out the big, big, big, big, big, big balloons

[Chorus]
Boy, when you're with me, I'll give you a taste 
I'll make it like your birthday every day
I know you like it sweet, so you can have your cake
Give you something good to celebrate 
Boy, when you're with me, I'll give you a taste 
Make it like your birthday every day 
I know you like it sweet, so you can have your cake
Give you something good to celebrate

[Post-Chorus]
So make a wish
I'll make it like your birthday every day
I'll be your gift
Give you something good to celebrate

[Outro]
Happy birthday

[Verse 1]
There's a stranger in my bed
There's a pounding in my head
Glitter all over the room
Pink flamingos in the pool
I smell like a minibar
DJ's passed out in the yard
Barbies on the barbeque
This a hickey or a bruise?

[Pre-Chorus]
Pictures of last night ended up online
I'm screwed, oh well
It's a blacked out blur, but I'm pretty sure it ruled
Damn

[Chorus]
Last Friday night
Yeah, we danced on tabletops
And we took too many shots
Think we kissed, but I forgot
Last Friday night
Yeah, we maxed our credit cards
And got kicked out of the bar, so we hit the boulevard
Last Friday night
We went streaking in the park
Skinny dipping in the dark, then had a mnage  trois
Last Friday night
Yeah, I think we broke the law
Always say we're gonna stop-op, oh whoa

[Post-Chorus]
But this Friday night, do it all again
But this Friday night, do it all again

[Verse 2]
Trying to connect the dots
Don't know what to tell my boss
Think the city towed my car
Chandelier is on the floor
Ripped my favorite party dress
Warrant's out for my arrest
Think I need a ginger ale
That was such an epic fail

[Pre-Chorus]
Pictures of last night ended up online
I'm screwed, oh well
It's a blacked out blur, but I'm pretty sure it ruled
Damn

[Chorus]
Last Friday night
Yeah, we danced on tabletops
And we took too many shots
Think we kissed, but I forgot
Last Friday night
Yeah, we maxed our credit cards
And got kicked out of the bar, so we hit the boulevard
Last Friday night
We went streaking in the park
Skinny dipping in the dark, then had a mnage  trois
Last Friday night
Yeah, I think we broke the law
Always say we're gonna stop-op, oh whoa

[Post-Chorus]
But this Friday night, do it all again 
This Friday night, do it all again
 This Friday night

[Bridge]
T.G.I.F., T.G.I.F., T.G.I.F
T.G.I.F., T.G.I.F., T.G.I.F

[Chorus]
Last Friday night
Yeah, we danced on tabletops
And we took too many shots
Think we kissed, but I forgot
Last Friday night
Yeah, we maxed our credit cards

Yeah, I think we broke the law
Always say we're gonna stop-op, oh whoa

[Post-Chorus]
But this Friday night, do it all again

[Produced by Dr. Luke and Max Martin]

[Verse 1]
Oh no, did I get too close?
Oh, did I almost see what's really on the inside?
All your insecurities
All the dirty laundry
Never made me blink one time

[Chorus]
Unconditional, unconditionally
I will love you unconditionally
There is no fear now
Let go and just be free
I will love you unconditionally

[Verse 2]
So come just as you are to me
Don't need apologies
Know that you areworthy
I'll take your bad days with your good
Walk through the storm, I would
I'd do it all because I love you
I love you

[Chorus]
Unconditional, unconditionally
I will love you unconditionally
There is no fear now
Let go and just be free
I will love you unconditionally

[Verse 3]
So open up your heart and just let it begin
Open up your heart and just let it begin
Open up your heart and just let it begin
Open up your heart

[Bridge]
Acceptance is the key to be
To be truly free
Will you do the same for me?

[Chorus]
Unconditional, unconditionally
I will love you unconditionally
And there is no fear now
Let go and just be free
'Cause I will love you unconditionally, oh yeah

[Outro]
I will love you 
I will love you
I will love you unconditionally

[Verse 1]
Boy, tell me, can you take my breath away?
Cruisin' down a heart-shaped highway
Got you swervin' lane-to-lane, don't hit the brakes
'Cause I'm feelin' so safe

[Pre-Chorus]
I'll be your baby, on a Sunday
Oh, why don't we get out of town?
Call me your baby, on the same wave
Oh, no, no, there's no slowin' down

[Chorus]
You and I, I
Ridin' Harleys in Hawaii-i-i
I'm on the back, I'm holdin' tight, I
Want you to take me for a ride, ride
When I hula-hula, hula
So good, you'll take me to the jeweler-jeweler, jeweler
There's pink and purple in the sky-y-y
We're ridin' Harleys in Hawaii-i-i

[Verse 2]
Let me run my fingers through your salty hair
Go ahead, explore the island vibes
So real that you can feel it in the air
I'm revvin' up your engine

Oh, why don't we get out of town? 
Call me your baby, catch the same wave
Oh, no, no, there's no slowin' down

Ridin' Harleys in Hawaii-i-i

Oh...
We're ridin' Harleys in Hawaii-i

[Verse 1]
You're so hypnotizing
Could you be the devil?
Could you be an angel?
Your touch, magnetizing
Feels like I am floating
Leaves my body glowing
They say be afraid
You're not like the others
Futuristic lover
Different DNA
They don't understand you

[Pre-Chorus]
You're from a whole 'nother world
A different dimension
You open my eyes
And I'm ready to go, lead me into the light

[Chorus]
Kiss me, ki-ki-kiss me
Infect me with your lovin'
Fill me with your poison
Take me, ta-ta-take me
Wanna be your victim
Ready for abduction
Boy, you're an alien
Your touch, so foreign
It's supernatural
Extraterrestrial

[Verse 2]
You're so supersonic
Wanna feel your powers
Stun me with your lasers
Your kiss is cosmic
Every move is magic

[Pre-Chorus]
You're from a whole 'nother world
A different dimension
You open my eyes
And I'm ready to go, lead me into the light

[Chorus]
Kiss me, ki-ki-kiss me
Infect me with your lovin'
Fill me with your poison
Take me, ta-ta-take me
Wanna be your victim
Ready for abduction
Boy, you're an alien
Your touch, so foreign
It's supernatural
Extraterrestrial

[Bridge]
This is transcendental
On another level
Boy, you're my lucky star
I wanna walk on your wavelength
And be there when you vibrate
For you, I'll risk it all, all

[Chorus]
Kiss me, ki-ki-kiss me
Infect me with your lovin'
Fill me with your poison
Take me, ta-ta-take me
Wanna be your victim
Ready for abduction
Boy, you're an alien
Your touch, so foreign
It's supernatural
Extraterrestrial

Extraterrestrial
Extraterrestrial
Boy, you're an alien
Your touch, so foreign
It's supernatural

[Verse 1]
A big beautiful brain with a pretty face, yeah
A babydoll with a briefcase, yeah
A hot little hurricane, ha!
'Cause I'm feminine and soft, but I'm still a boss, yeah
Red lipstick, but still so raw, yeah
Marilyn Monroe in a monster truck

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause I can be zen and I can be the storm, yeah
Smell like a rose and I pierce like a thorn, yeah
Karate chopping the clichs and norms all in a dress

[Chorus]
Hey, hey, hey
You think that I'm a little baby
You think that I am fragile like a Faberg
You think that I am cracking, but you can't break me
No-o-o-o-oh, no way
No-o-o-o-oh, no way
No-o-o-o-oh, no way
You think that I am cracking, but you can't break me


[Verse 2]
Yeah, I bounce back like a pro 'cause I'm so resilient
LOL at all your limits
Keep your penny thoughts, I'm making a mint

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause I can be zen and I can be the storm, yeah
Smell like a rose and I pierce like a thorn, yeah
Karate chopping the clichs and norms all in a dress

[Chorus]
Hey, hey, hey
You think that I'm a little baby
You think that I am fragile like a Faberg
You think that I am cracking, but you can't break me
No-o-o-o-oh, no way
No-o-o-o-oh, no way
No-o-o-o-oh, no way
You think that I am cracking, but you can't break me 


[Bridge]
I ain't got no strings 
I'm no one's little puppet
Got my own cha-ching, in my chubby little wallet
And secretly you love it

And secretly you love it

[Chorus]
Hey, hey, hey 
You think that I'm a little baby
You think that I am fragile like a Faberg
You think that I am cracking, but you can't break me
No-o-o-o-oh

[Intro]
This is how we do
This is how we do 

[Verse 1]
Sipping on Ros
Silver Lake sun coming up all lazy 
Slow cooking pancakes for my boy
Still up, still fresh as a daisy 
Playing ping pong all night long
Everything's all neon and hazy 
Chanel this, Chanel that
Hell yeah, all my girls vintage Chanel, baby

Big hoops, and maroon lips
My clique hopping in my Maserati 
Santa Barbara-chic at La Super Rica
Grabbing tacos, checking out hotties 
Now we talkin astrology
Getting our nails did all Japanese-y 
Day drinking at the Wildcat
Sucking real bad at Mariah Carey-oke

Yo, this one goes out to the ladies
At breakfast, in last night's dress

Uh-huh, I see you
Yo, this goes out to all you kids
That still have their cars at the club valet
And it's Tuesday

Yo, shoutout to all you kids
Buying bottle service with your rent money!
Respect!

Chilling, laid-back, straight stunting
Yeah, we do it like that

This goes out to all you people
Going to bed with a 10, and waking up with a 2

Ha, not me!

[Chorus Until fade]
This is how we do, yeah
Chilling, laid-back, straight stunting
Yeah, we do it like that
This is how we do, do-do-do-do

[Intro]
I'm wide awake
I'm wide awake
I'm wide awake

[Verse 1]
Yeah, I was in the dark
I was falling hard
With an open heart 
How did I read the stars so wrong? 
And now its clear to me
That everything you see
Aint always what it seems 
Yeah, I was dreaming for so long

[Pre-Chorus]
I wish I knew then, what I know now
Wouldnt dive in, wouldnt bow down
Gravity hurts, you made it so sweet
Til I woke up on, on the concrete

[Chorus]
Falling from cloud nine
Crashing from the high
I'm letting go tonight
Yeah, I'm falling from cloud nine

[Verse 2]
I'm wide awake
Not losing any sleep
I picked up every piece
And landed on my feet 
Need nothing to complete myself, no 
Yeah, I am born again
Out of the lion's den
I don't have to pretend 
The story's over now, the end

[Pre-Chorus]
I wish I knew then, what I know now
Wouldn't dive in, wouldn't bow down
Gravity hurts, you made it so sweet
'Til I woke up on, on the concrete

[Chorus]
Falling from cloud nine 
Crashing from the high
I'm letting go tonight 
I'm falling from cloud nine 

[Bridge]
Thunder rumbling
Castles crumbling 
I am trying to hold on 
God knows that I tried
Seeing the bright side 
But I'm not blind anymore

[Interlude]
I'm wide awake
I'm wide awake

[Chorus]
Yeah, I'm falling from cloud nine 
Crashing from the high
You know, I'm letting go tonight 
I'm falling from cloud nine

[Outro]
I'm wide awake
I'm wide awake
I'm wide awake
I'm wide awake
I'm wide awake

[Verse 1]
Isn't it strange that you used to know me?
All the highs and lows and in-betweens
And now you see me and just say, "Hey"
Isn't it weird that you've seen me naked?
We had conversations 'bout forever
Now it's 'bout the weather okay

[Pre-Chorus]
And I just can't believe
We went from strangers to lovers to strangers in a lifetime
Now just memories
We've gone from strangers to lovers to strangers
Yeah

[Chorus]
Acting like we never met
Faking like we'd just forget
We were lovers
And now there's nothing left but small talk
Had every inch of your skin
There's nowhere your hands haven't been
Ain't it funny?
'Cause now there's nothing left but small talk

[Verse 2]
Isn't it wild that I know your weakness?
And everybody at the party thinks
That you're the best since sliced bread
And isn't it awkward I got a new somebody?
And honestly it'll probably be a while before we can just be friends

[Pre-Chorus]
I just can't believe
We went from strangers to lovers to strangers in a lifetime
Now just memories
We've gone from strangers to lovers to strangers


[Chorus]
Acting like we never met
Faking like we'd just forget
We were lovers
And now there's nothing left but small talk
Had every inch of your skin
There's nowhere your hands haven't been 
Ain't it funny?
'Cause now there's nothing left but small talk

[Post-Chorus]
Blah-blah-blah-blah
Blah-blah-blah-blah
Blah-blah-blah-blah
Now there's nothing left but small talk
Blah-blah-blah-blah 
Blah-blah-blah-blah 
Blah-blah-blah-blah 
Now there's nothing left but small talk

[Bridge]
And I just can't believe
We went from strangers to lovers to strangers

[Chorus]
Acting like we never met
Faking like we'd just forget
We were lovers
And now there's nothing left but small talk
Had every inch of your skin
There's nowhere your hands haven't been 
Ain't it funny?
'Cause now there's nothing left but small talk


[Post-Chorus]
Blah-blah-blah-blah
Blah-blah-blah-blah 
Blah-blah-blah-blah
Now there's nothing left but small talk 
Blah-blah-blah-blah
Blah-blah-blah-blah 
Blah-blah-blah-blah
Now there's nothing left but small talk

[Verse 1]
Days like this, I want to drive away
Pack my bags and watch your shadow fade
You chewed me up and spit me out
Like I was poison in your mouth
You took my light, you drained me down
But that was then and this is now
Now look at me

[Chorus]
This is the part of me
That youre never gonna ever take away from me, no
This is the part of me
That youre never gonna ever take away from me, no
Throw your sticks and your stones
Throw your bombs and your blows
But youre not gonna break my soul
This is the part of me
That youre never gonna ever take away from me, no

[Verse 2]
I just wanna throw my phone away
Find out who is really there for me
You ripped me off, your love was cheap
Was always tearing at the seams
I fell deep, you let me drown
But that was then and this is now
Now look at me

[Chorus]
This is the part of me
That youre never gonna ever take away from me, no
This is the part of me
That youre never gonna ever take away from me, no
Throw your sticks and your stones
Throw your bombs and your blows
But youre not gonna break my soul
This is the part of me
That youre never gonna ever take away from me, no

[Bridge]
Now look at me, Im sparkling
A firework, a dancing flame
You wont ever put me out again
Im glowing, oh whoa
So you can keep the diamond ring
It don't mean nothing anyway
In fact you can keep everything
Yeah, yeah, except for me

[Chorus]
This is the part of me
That youre never gonna ever take away from me, no
This is the part of me
That youre never gonna ever take away from me, no 
Throw your sticks and your stones
Throw your bombs and your blows
But youre not gonna break my soul 
This is the part of me
That youre never gonna ever take away from me, no

[Outro]
This is the part of me 
Away from me 
This is the part of me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me
No
Throw your sticks and your stones
Throw your bombs and your blows
But youre not gonna break my soul
This is the part of me
That youre never gonna ever take away from me, no

[Verse 1]
I was fine before I met you
Truth is that I lost myself inside you
It is not fair to put all that on you
But you took control of a vulnerable soul 
I am my mothers daughter
And there are so many things I love about her
But I have, I have to break the cycle
So I can sit first at the dinner table

[Chorus]
You can't clip my wings, can't wilt my flowers
Stole my time, but I'll make up the hours
'Cause I'm a goddess and you know it
Some respect, you better show it
I'm done with you siphoning my power
Power

[Verse 2]
Hell hath no fury like a woman reborn
And now I'm burning like a blue flame once more
But don't mistake my warmth for weakness
Don't bite the hand that feeds or you'll
You'll never eat, no-oh

[Chorus]
You can't clip my wings, can't wilt my flowers
Stole my time, but I'll make up the hours
'Cause I'm a goddess and you know it
Some respect, you better show it
I'm done with you siphoning my power
Power 

[Bridge]
And now I'm taking it back
Electric as fuck 
You can't quiet this thunder, no 
Yeah, I'm taking it back
Lit all the way up
Even in the dark, I glow 

[Chorus]
You can't clip my wings, can't wilt my flowers
Stole my time, but I'll make up the hours, oh
'Cause I'm a goddess and you know it
Some respect, you better show it
I'm done with you siphoning my power
Power

[Intro]
Your mind may refuse to believe
Your mind may refuse to believe

[Verse 1]
I hope you hang yourself with your H&M scarf
While jacking off listening to Mozart
You bitch and moan about LA
Wishing you were in the rain reading Hemingway
You don't eat meat
And drive electrical cars
You're so indie rock its almost an art
You need SPF 45 just to stay alive

[Chorus]
You're so gay, and you don't even like boys
No, you don't even like
No, you don't even like
No, you don't even like boys
You're so gay, and you don't even like boys
No, you don't even like
No, you don't even like
No, you don't even like...

[Verse 2]
You're so sad, maybe you should buy a happy meal
Youre so skinny, you should really Super Size the deal
Secretly you're so amused that nobody understands you
I'm so mean 'cause I cannot get you out of your head
I'm so angry because youd rather MySpace instead
I can't believe I fell in love with someone that wears more makeup, and

[Chorus]
You're so gay, and you don't even like boys
No, you don't even like
No, you don't even like
No, you don't even like boys
You're so gay, and you don't even like boys
No, you don't even like
No, you don't even like
No, you don't even like...

[Breakdown]
Hey
Oh, whoa-oh-oh-oh!
La la la, la la la
Do do do, bah bah bah
Do do do, da da day
You're so gay
You're so gay

[Bridge]
You walk around like you're oh so debonair
You pull 'em down and there's really nothing there
I wish you would just be real with me

[Chorus]
You're so gay, and you don't even like boys
No, you don't even like
No, you don't even like
No, you don't even like boys
You're so gay, and you don't even like boys
No, you don't even like

Oh, no no no no no no no
You're so gay, and you don't even like boys

You're so gay, and you don't even like boys
No, you don't even like
No, you don't even like
No, you don't even like... penis

[Verse 1]
I live off the echoes of your "I love you's"
But I still feel the blows from all of your "dont want to's"
When youre drunk, you say Im the one
Then you wake up
You suck my heart up in a vacuum

[Chorus]
Cause every days the same
Definition of insane
I think were running on a loop
Dj vu
So tell me something new
Figure out the Rubiks Cube
I think were running on a loop
Dj vu

[Verse 2]
Your words are like Chinese water torture
And theres no finish line, always one more corner
Yeah, they slither like a centipede
Why do you keep me
At the end of a rope that keeps getting shorter?

[Chorus]
Cause every days the same
Definition of insane
I think were running on a loop
Dj vu
So tell me something new
Figure out the Rubiks Cube
I think were running on a loop
Dj vu

[Interlude]

[Chorus]
Cause every days the same
Definition of insane
I think were running on a loop
Dj vu
So tell me something new 
Figure out the Rubiks Cube
I think were running on a loop
Dj vu 
Cause every days the same 
Definition of insane 
I think were running on a loop
Dj vu 

[Outro]
Dj vu

[Verse 1]
I'm uptight
Playing by the rules in this game of life
365 days on the grind
Something's stirring, I might need to unwind
Then, there's you
Texting me a little bubble of trouble
I've tried to ignore these thoughts that rumble
I think I'm bored of being so careful

[Pre-Chorus]
Big city lights
Got me flirting with fire
Tonight I'ma let my hair down
Have a few rounds and just let go

[Chorus]
Like roulette, ooh-ooh
Wanna close my eyes and roll it with you
Like roulette, ooh-ooh
Wanna lose control and forget with you
Like roulette 
Let's roll it 

[Verse 2]
They say everything in moderation
And sometimes, you got to give in to temptation
So I drop a pin to my location
Let's roll the dice

[Pre-Chorus]
Big city lights
Got me flirting with fire
Tonight I'ma let my hair down
Have a few rounds and just let go

[Chorus]
Like roulette, ooh-ooh
Wanna close my eyes and roll it with you
Like roulette, ooh-ooh
Wanna lose control and forget with you
Oh, like roulette 
Let's roll it 
Like roulette 
Let's roll it 

[Bridge]
So tonight, we test limits 
Take the safety off for a minute 
'Cause my love's a bullet with your name written on it
Just load it and spin it

[Chorus]
Like roulette, ooh-ooh
Wanna close my eyes and roll it with you 
Like roulette, ooh-ooh
Wanna lose control and forget with you 
Like roulette 
Let's roll it 

Like roulette 

Wanna close my eyes and roll it with you
Like roulette

[Verse 1]
Comparisons are easily done
Once you've had a taste of perfection
Like an apple hanging from a tree
I picked the ripest one
I still got the seed

[Pre-Chorus 1]
You said move on, where do I go?
I guess second best is all I will know

[Chorus]
'Cause when I'm with him, I am thinking of you
Thinking of you
What you would do if
You were the one who was spending the night
Oh, I wish that I was looking into your eyes

[Verse 2]
You're like an Indian summer in the middle of winter
Like a hard candy with a surprise center
How do I get better once I've had the best?
You said there's tons of fish in the water
So the waters I will test

[Pre-Chorus 2]
He kissed my lips, I taste your mouth, oh
He pulled me in, I was disgusted with myself

[Chorus]
'Cause when I'm with him, I am thinking of you

Thinking of you
What you would do if
You were the one who was spending the night

Oh, I wish that I was looking into your

[Bridge]
The best
And yes, I do regret
How I could let myself let you go
Now, now the lesson's learned
I touched it, I was burned
Oh, I think you should know

[Chorus]
'Cause when I'm with him, I am thinking of you
Thinking of you
What you would do if
You were the one who was spending the night

Oh, I wish that I was looking into your eyes
Looking into your eyes
Looking into your eyes
Oh, won't you walk through
And bust in the door and take me away
Oh, no more mistakes
'Cause in your eyes, I'd like to stay
Stay

[Verse 1]
Saw your picture on accident
Your face has changed
The lines are sinking in
I pressed play, I should haven't
Congratulations
But do you ever wonder what we could have been?


[Pre-Chorus 1]
But your mind plays tricks with distance
Always makes things feel so unfinished

[Chorus]
I miss you more than I loved you
I do
I miss you more than I loved you

I miss you more than I loved you
I do
I miss you more than I loved you


[Verse 2]
I saw a balloon floating away
I thought, "Did someone let go, or did they lose it?"
So strange, you know all my secrets
Please keep them safe
And darling, you know that I'll do the same


[Pre-Chorus 2]
Though we're no longer in existence
Baby, you'll always be in my orbit

[Chorus]
I miss you more than I loved you
I do
I miss you more than I loved you

I miss you more than I loved you
Oh, I do
I miss you more than I loved you

[Bridge]
We were a match, but not a fit
We were a dream, unrealistic
We didn't lose, we didn't win

Oh

[Chorus]
I miss you more than I loved you
Oh, I do
I miss you more than I loved you

I miss you more than I loved you

Oh, I do
I miss you more than I loved you


[Outro]
Ohh-oh-oh-oh 
No-oh-oh-oh-oh 

[Verse 1]
I remember when you used to be my every other thought
But now my calendar's so full, it's easier to move on
Sometimes I swear I pass your SUV on Sunset Boulevard
I don't fuck with change, but lately, I've been flipping coins a lot

[Chorus]
I struggle
I juggle
I could just throw a line to you
But I should let sleeping dogs lie
'Cause I know better, baby
I write it
Erase it
Repeat it
But what good will it do to reopen the wound?
So I take a deep breath and I save as draft

[Verse 2]
You don't have to subtweet me
My number's always been the same
But all's been said and done
Will we ever really close this case?
Yeah, I will always be here for you, but I could no longer stay
Still my body goes in shock every time I hear your name

[Chorus]
I struggle
I juggle
I could just throw a line to you
But I should let sleeping dogs lie
'Cause I know better, baby
I write it
Erase it
Repeat it
But what good will it do to reopen the wound?
So I take a deep breath and I save as draft

[Bridge]
I've heard you've done some changing
I've been rearranging
Wish that I could know, but I just don't know
Never get that time back
Fear we'd fall in old traps
Why can't we just let go?
Staring at a fork in the fucking road

[Chorus]
I struggle
I juggle
I could just throw a line to you
But I should let sleeping dogs lie 
'Cause I know better, baby
I write it
Erase it
Repeat it
But what good will it do to reopen the wound?
So I take a deep breath and I save as draft

[Verse 1]
Please don't tip-toe
Come close, let's flow
Anchor in me, and get lost at sea
The world's your oyster and I am the pearl
Open waters
Sink into me slowly

[Chorus]
So baby, come and take a swim with me
Make me ripple 'til I'm wavy
Don't be scared to dive in deep
And start a tsunami
Tsunami

[Verse 2]
Don't fight
Just ride the rhythm of the tide
We swirl, we spin
Salted, sun-kissed skin
We float together
Whatever weather
Embrace the breeze and sail away smoothly

[Chorus]
So baby, come and take a swim with me
Make me ripple 'til I'm wavy
Don't be scared to dive in deep
And start a tsunami
Tsunami

[Bridge]
Oh, you're waking up an ocean of emotion
That my body can't hide 
Tsunami 
Now you're soaked in my devotion
'Cause you opened up a paradise 
Tsunami 
Tsunami

[Chorus]
So baby, come and take a swim with me 
Make me ripple 'til I'm wavy 
Don't be scared to dive in deep 
And start a tsunami
Tsunami

[Verse 1]
Was 27, surviving my return of Saturn
A long vacation didn't sound so bad
Was full of secrets, locked up tight like Iron Mountain
Running on empty, so out of gas

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Thought I wasnt enough
Found I wasnt so tough
Laying on the bathroom floor
We were living on a fault line
And I felt the fault was all mine
Couldnt take it anymore

[Chorus]
By the grace of God 
I picked myself back up 
I put one foot in front of the other and I
Looked in the mirror and decided to stay
Wasn't gonna let love take me out that way

[Verse 2]
I thank my sister for keeping my head above the water
When the truth was like swallowing sand
Now every morning, there is no more mourning
Oh, I can finally see myself again

[Pre-Chorus 2]
I know I am enough, possible to be loved
It was not about me
Now I have to rise above
Let the universe call the bluff
Yeah, the truth will set you free

[Chorus]
By the grace of God 
I picked myself back up 
I put one foot in front of the other and I
Looked in the mirror and decided to stay
Wasn't gonna let love take me out

[Bridge]
Oh, that way, no
That way, no
Not in the name of love 
That way, no
That way, no
I am not giving up

[Breakdown]
By the grace of God
I picked myself back up
I put one foot in front of the other
And I looked in the mirror 
Looked in the mirror 

[Chorus]
By the grace of God 

I picked myself back up 

I put one foot in front of the other and I 
Looked in the mirror and decided to stay
Wasn't gonna let love take me out that way

You got patina, ain't so green, nah
You earned this spot, got your receipts, yeah
Funny, gotta add addendums to your dreams
Still you never sleep, no
You never sleep, ah
Oh, you learned to dance, to bob and weave, yeah
To let that water roll off easy, yeah
You grew yourself above the weeds
Taller than the trees, oh

So, don't try and reinvent your wheel
'Cause you're too original
Baby, just stay classic
Ain't broke, ain't broke, don't fix it

It's a pendulum, it all comes back, it all comes back around

[Bridge]
And there is no need to worry, the pages keep on turning
And it goes on and on, comes all the way around
There is no need to hurry if there's a fire burning
'Cause it goes on and on, comes all the way around
All the way around
Hey, around
Oh , c'mon
Ain't broke, ain't broke, don't fix it
Your highs, your lows, just ride it

[Chorus]
It's a pendulum, it all comes back around 
It's a pendulum, it's a pendulum 
Life's a pendulum, it'll all come back around 
It's a pendulum, it all comes back, it all comes back
It's a pendulum, it all comes back around 
It's a pendulum , it's a pendulum
Life's a pendulum, it'll all come back around 
It's a pendulum, it all comes back, it all comes back[Refrain]

You are my destiny, my mantra

I never knew I could see something so clearly looking through my third eye
Never knew karma could be so rewarding and bring me to your light
Maybe this is the beginning of something so magical tonight
Oh, oh-oh-oh

Take me down to the river
Underneath the blood-orange sun
Say my name like a scripture
Keep my heart beating like a drum

Go down in history, go down together
Into infinity, forever
Your Cleopatra, your blushing Juliet
Anything for your love, a ride or die

[Produced by Max Martin and Dr. Luke]"You know, sometimes you can be blinded by your extreme emotions. I definitely was looking for answers, during that time when I wrote that song, and yeah, I was depressed and sad, and there were thoughts, but there were never actions, thankfully. But I wanted to share that side of my story, because I know there are so many other people out there that have gone through things like that, and you always feel like youre the only one going through that. You walk out the door, and you see someone you know, and they ask you how you are, and you just have to say youre fine when youre not really fine, but you just cant get into it, because they would never understand. Well, then comes along a song that speaks to you, that makes you feel like Gosh, I can get through this if she can get through this, I can get through this.'"

[Verse 1]
I'm thirty-something going on thirteen
Still a sponge to everything
Saucer eyes wide, yeah, I still believe
And a sparkle in my steps
Smiling with my teeth

[Pre-Chorus]
They say that I might lose my Midas touch
They also say I may become irrelevant
But who the fuck are they anyway?
I don't care what they say

[Chorus]
I won't act my age
Time is just an invention man has made
No, I won't act my age
It's just my reflection that is out of date
'Cause it's all in your attitude
It's all in your point of view
I won't act my age
Just need a little bit of Peter Pan and some imagination
No, I won't act my age

[Verse 2]
So, I recommend that you lose your mind
It was the only thing that was keeping me behind

[Pre-Chorus]
They say curb your curiosity
They also say prepare to amend your dreams
But who the fuck are they anyway?
I don't care what they say

[Chorus]
'Cause I won't act my age
Time is just an invention man has made
No, I won't act my age
It's just my reflection that is out of date
'Cause it's all in your attitude
It's all in your point of view
I won't act my age 
Just need a little bit of Peter Pan and some imagination
No, I won't act my age

[Bridge]
How old would you be? Yeah
How old would you really be
If you didn't know, yeah
How old you really were?
How old would you be? Yeah
How old would you really be
If you didn't know 
How old you really were?


[Chorus]
I won't act my age
Time is just an invention man has made
No, I won't act my age
It's just my reflection that is out of date
'Cause it's all in your attitude
It's all in your point of view
I won't act my age
Just need a little bit of Peter Pan and some imagination
No, I won't act my age

[Outro]
Oh-oh, I won't act my age
Ooh, yeah, ooh
Ooh, yeah, ooh
I won't act my age

[Verse 1: Beyonc]
I've been drinkin', I've been drinkin'
I get filthy when that liquor get into me
I've been thinkin', I've been thinkin'
Why can't I keep my fingers off it?
Baby, I want you, now-now
Why can't I keep my fingers off you?
Baby, I want you, now-now
Cigars on ice, cigars on ice
Feelin' like an animal with these cameras all in my grill
Flashin' lights, flashin' lights
You got me faded, faded, faded
Baby, I want you, now-now
Can't keep your eyes off my fatty
Daddy, I want you, now-now
Drunk in love, I want you

[Pre-Chorus: Beyonc]
We woke up in the kitchen
Saying, "How the hell did this shit happen?"
Oh, baby, drunk in love
We be all night, last thing I remember
Is our beautiful bodies grindin' up in that club
Drunk in love

[Chorus: Beyonc]
We be all night, love, love
We be all night, love, love

[Verse 2: Beyonc]
We be all night, and everything all right
No complaints from my body
So fluorescent under these lights
Boy, I'm drinkin', park it in my lot, 7-11
I'm rubbin' on it, rub-rubbin'
If you scared, call that reverend
Boy, I'm drinkin', get my brain right
Armand de Brignac, gangster wife
Louis sheets, he sweat it out
Like washrags, he wet it up
Boy, I'm drinkin', I'm singin' on the mic to my boy toys
Then I fill the tub up halfway
Then ride it with my surfboard, surfboard, surfboard
Grainin' on that wood
Grainin'-grainin' on that wood
I'm swervin' on that, swervin'-swervin' on that
Big body been servin' all this
Swerve, surfin' all in this good-good

[Pre-Chorus: Beyonc]
We woke up in the kitchen
Saying, "How the hell did this shit happen?"
Oh, baby, drunk in love
We be all night, last thing I remember
Is our beautiful bodies grindin' up in that club
Drunk in love

[Chorus: Beyonc + JAY-Z]
We be all night, love, love
We be all night, love, love
I'm nice right now Hold up!

[Verse 3: JAY-Z]
That D'USS is the shit if I do say so myself
If I do say so myself, if I do say so myself
Hold up, stumble all in the house
Time to back up all that mouth
That you had all in the car
Talkin' about you the baddest bitch thus far
Talkin' about you be reppin' that Third
I wanna see all that shit that I heard
Know I sling Clint Eastwood
Hope you can handle this curve, uh
Foreplay in a foyer, fucked up my Warhol
Slid the panties right to the side
Ain't got the time to take drawers off
On sight, catch a charge I might
Beat the box up, like Mike in '97, I bite
I'm Ike Turner, turn up, baby, no I don't play
"Now eat the cake, Anna Mae!"
Said, "Eat the cake, Anna Mae!"
I'm nice, for y'all to reach these heights
You gon' need G3, 4, 5, 6 flights
Sleep tight, we sex again in the morning
Your breasteses is my breakfast
We goin' in, we be all night

[Chorus: Beyonc]
We be all night, love, love
We be all night, love, love

[Bridge: Beyonc]
I'm never tired, never tired
I been sippin', that's the only thing
That's keepin' me on fire, we on fire
Didn't mean to spill that liquor all on my attire
I've been drinkin', watermelon
I want your body right here
Daddy, I want you, right now
Can't keep your eyes off my fatty
Daddy, I want you

[Chorus: Beyonc]
We be all night, love, love
We be all night, love, love

Let me hear you say, "Hey, Ms. Carter!" 
Say, "Hey, Ms. Carter!" 
Give me some!

[Verse 1]
See me up in the club with fifty-'leven girls
Posted in the back, diamond fangs in my grill
Brooklyn brim with my eyes sitting low
Every boy in here with me got that smoke
Every girl in here got to look me up and down
All on Instagram, cake by the pound
Circulate the image every time I come around
G's up, tell me how I'm looking, babe

[Bridge]
Boy, this all for you just walk my way
Just tell me how it's looking, babe
Just tell me how it's looking, babe

I do this all for you, baby, just take aim
And tell me how it's looking babe

Tell me how it's looking babe, looking babe

[Verse 2]
Drop the bass, mane, the bass get lower
Radio say "Speed it up", I just go slower
High like treble, pumping on the mids
Ya man ain't ever seen a booty like this
And why you think ya keep my name rolling off the tongue
'Cause when he wanna smash, I'll just write another one
I sneezed on the beat and the beat got sicker
Yonc all on his mouth like liquor
Yonc all on his mouth like liquor
Yonc all on his mouth like liquor
Yonc all on his mouth like liquor

Driver, roll up the partition, please
Driver, roll up the partition, please

Took forty-five minutes to get all dressed up

Now my mascara running, red lipstick smudged
Oh, he so horny, yeah, he want to fuck
He popped all my buttons, and he ripped my blouse
He Monica Lewinsky-ed all on my gown

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, there daddy, daddy didnt bring the towel
Oh, baby, baby we betta slow it down

[Verse 2]
Driver, roll up the partition fast 
Driver, roll up the partition fast
Over there I swear I saw them cameras flash
Handprints and footprints on my glass
Handprints and good grips all on my ass
Private show with the music blasting
He like to call me Peaches when we get this nasty
Red wine drip, well talk that trash
Chauffeur eavesdropping, trying not to crash

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, there daddy, daddy now you ripped my fur
Oh, baby baby be sweating out my hair
Took forty-five minutes to get all dressed up
We ain't even gonna make it to this club

I've been watching for the signs
Took a trip to clear my mind, oh
Now I'm even more lost
And you're still so fine, oh my, oh my
Been having conversations about breakups and separations
I'm not feeling like myself since the baby
Are we gonna even make it? Oh
'Cause if we are, we're taking this a little too far
If we are, we're taking this a little too far
Baby, if we are, we're taking this a little too far
Me being wherever I'm at, worried about wherever you are
We're taking this a little too far
We're taking this a little too far
We're taking this a little too far

[Chorus 1: Drake]

Do it big, do it all for a good girl
One time, this is a song for the good girl
Dont sleep when you know you got it good, girl
One time, this is a song for the good girl
Wanna roll, wanna roll with a good girl?
One time, this is a song for the good girl
And I still keep it hood, still treat you like I should
Wassup?

[Verse 2: Beyonc]
On my mind, up past my bedtime, no rest at the kingdom
Alone in my place, my heart is away, all that I can think of is
We should get married, we should get married
Let's stop holding back on this and let's get carried away

[Pre-Chorus: Beyonc]
Stop making a big deal out of the little things
'Cause I got big deals and I got little things
Got everything I'm asking for but you

Let's get carried away
Come right now, you know where I stay

[Chorus 2: Drake & Beyonc]

Fuck what you heard, you're mine, you're mine

Wanna roll, wanna roll with a good girl?
One time, this is a song for the good girl
And I still keep it hood, still treat you like I should
Wassup?

Stop making a big deal out of the little things

I miss feeling on you, I miss everything that's real about you
And that's everything about you that's just how I feel about you
I been about you and Im still about you but
We ain't finished talking
I told you you dont need to worry about them bitches
All them fives need to listen when the ten is talking
'Cause they dont wanna see you happier than them
And girl you swear they all ya friends and that's been a problem
You the one they hate, just come with that
I know you think it's funny that your ex is not a running back
But that nigga came running back
And you tell me that youre done with that
And I believe it's true
As long as you know who you belong to

[Outro: Beyonc]
All Im really asking for is you
Long as you know who you belong to

[Chorus]
Hold up, they don't love you like I love you
Slow down, they don't love you like I love you
Back up, they don't love you like I love you
Step down, they don't love you like I love you
Can't you see there's no other man above you?
What a wicked way to treat the girl that loves you
Hold up, they don't love you like I love you
Oh, down, they don't love you like I love you

[Verse 1]
Something don't feel right because it ain't right
Especially comin' up after midnight
I smell your secrets, and I'm not too perfect
To ever feel this worthless
How did it come down to this? Scrolling through your call list
I don't wanna lose my pride, but I'ma fuck me up a bitch
Know that I kept it sexy, you know I kept it fun
There's something that I'm missing, maybe my head for one

[Refrain]
What's worst, lookin' jealous or crazy? Jealous or crazy?
Or like being walked all over lately, walked all over lately
I'd rather be crazy

[Chorus]
Hold up, they don't love you like I love you
Slow down, they don't love you like I love you
Back up, they don't love you like I love you
Step down, they don't love you like I love you
Can't you see there's no other man above you?
What a wicked way to treat the girl that loves you
Hold up, they don't love you like I love you
Slow down, they don't love you like I love you

[Verse 2]
Let's imagine for a moment that you never made a name for yourself
Or mastered wealth, they had you labeled as a king
Never made it out the cage, still out there movin' in them streets
Never had the baddest woman in the game up in your sheets
Would they be down to ride? No
They used to hide from you, lie to you
But y'all know we were made for each other
So I find you and hold you down
Me sing se

[Chorus]
Hold up, they don't love you like I love you
Slow down, they don't love you like I love you
Back up, they don't love you like I love you
Step down, they don't love you like I love you
Can't you see there's no other man above you?
What a wicked way to treat the girl that loves you
Hold up, they don't love you like I love you
Slow down, they don't love you like I love you

[Bridge]
Hey, this such a shame
You let this good love go to waste
I always keep the top tier, 5 star
Backseat lovin' in the car
Like make that wood, like make that wood
Holly like a boulevard

[Refrain]
What's worse, lookin' jealous or crazy? Jealous and crazy?
Or like being walked all over lately, walked all over lately
I'd rather be crazy

[Chorus]
Hold up, they don't love you like I love you
Slow down, they don't love you like I love you
Back up, they don't love you like I love you
Step down, they don't love you like I love you
Can't you see there's no other man above you?
What a wicked way to treat the girl that loves you
Hold up, they don't love you like I love you
Oh, down, they don't love you like I love you

[Outro]
I hop up out my bed and get my swag on
I look in the mirror, say, "What's up?"
What's up, what's up, what's up
I hop up out my bed and get my swag on
I look in the mirror, say, "What's up?"
What's up, what's up, what's up

[Chorus]
Sorry, I ain't sorry
Sorry, I ain't sorry
I ain't sorry, nigga, nah
Sorry, I ain't sorry
Sorry, I ain't sorry
I ain't sorry

[Verse 1]
He trying to roll me up 
I ain't picking up 
Headed to the club 
I ain't thinking 'bout you 
Me and my ladies sip my D'USS cups
I don't give a fuck, chucking my deuces up
Suck on my balls, pause, I had enough 
I ain't thinking 'bout you
I ain't thinking 'bout

[Pre-Chorus]
Middle fingers up, put them hands high
Wave it in his face, tell him, boy, bye 
Tell him, boy, bye, boy, bye, middle fingers up
I ain't thinking 'bout you

[Chorus]
Sorry, I ain't sorry 
Sorry, I ain't sorry 
I ain't sorry, nigga, nah
I ain't thinking 'bout you
Sorry, I ain't sorry
Sorry, I ain't sorry, I ain't sorry
No, no, hell nah

[Verse 2]
Now you wanna say you're sorry
Now you wanna call me crying
Now you gotta see me wilding
Now I'm the one that's lying
And I don't feel bad about it
It's exactly what you get
Stop interrupting my grinding

I ain't thinking 'bout you

[Chorus]
Sorry, I ain't sorry
I ain't thinking 'bout you
I ain't thinking 'bout you
Sorry, I ain't sorry
I ain't thinking 'bout you
I ain't thinking 'bout you

[Pre-Chorus]
Middle fingers up, put them hands high
Wave it in his face, tell him, boy, bye  
Tell him, boy, bye , boy, bye 
Middle fingers up, I ain't thinking 'bout you

[Chorus]
Sorry, I ain't sorry
Sorry, I ain't sorry
I ain't sorry, nigga, nah
Sorry, I ain't sorry
Sorry, I ain't sorry
I ain't sorry
No, no, hell nah

[Bridge]
Looking at my watch, he shoulda been home
Today, I regret the night I put that ring on
He always got them fucking excuses
I pray to the Lord you reveal what his truth is

[Outro]
I left a note in the hallway
By the time you read it, I'll be far away
I'm far away
But I ain't fucking with nobody
Let's have a toast to the good life
Suicide before you see this tear fall down my eyes
Me and my baby, we gon' be alright
We gon' live a good life
Big homie better grow up
Me and my whoadies 'bout to stroll up
I see them boppers in the corner
They sneaking out the back door
He only want me when I'm not there
He better call Becky with the good hair
He better call Becky with the good hair

[Visual breakdown]

[Intro: Beyonc]
Dum-da-de-da
Do, do, do, do, do, do


[Verse 1: Beyonc]
It's that Yonc, your Yonc
In that lingerie, on that chardonnay
Scoring touchdowns on your runway
I'm Texas forever, like Bun B
And I'm Ramboing these hoes
I'm really rit' like Donjae
I'm camo-ing these hoes
These thots can't clock me nowadays
You wish I was your pound cake
Boy, you know I look good as fuck
Wish I was your baby momma
Want me to come around and give you good karma
But no, we escalating, up in this bitch, like elevators
Of course sometimes shit go down
When it's a billion dollars on an elevator
Of course sometimes shit go down
When it's a billion dollars on an elevator
Ha-ha! God damn, God damn, God damn!!!

[Bridge 1: Beyonc]
Momma taught me good home training
My Daddy taught me how to love my haters
My sister told me I should speak my mind
My man made me feel so God damn fine 

[Chorus: Beyonc]
You wake up, flawless, post up, flawless
Ridin' round in it, flawless, flossin' on that, flawless
This diamond, flawless, my diamond, flawless
This rock, flawless, my Roc, flawless
I woke up like this, I woke up like this
We flawless, ladies tell 'em
I woke up like this, I woke up like this
We flawless, ladies tell 'em
Say "I look so good tonight"
God damn, God damn
Say "I look so good tonight"
God damn, God damn, God damn

[Bridge 2: Beyonc]
I wake up looking this good

And I wouldn't change it if I could

And you can say what you want, I'm the shit

I'm the shit, I'm the shit, I'm the shit
I want everyone to feel like this tonight
God damn, God damn, God damn!

[Sample: SpottieOttieDopaliscious]


[Verse 2: Nicki Minaj & ]
Looking Trinidadian, Japanese and Indian
Got Malaysian, got that yaki, that wavy Brazilian
 UHN! 

Yo, like MJ doctor, they killing me -
Propofol, I know they hope I fall
But tell 'em winning, is my motherfuckin' protocol
'Cause I score, before I ever throw the ball
These bitches washed up and ain't no fuckin' soap involved
 This every hood nigga dream, fantasizin' 'bout Nicki and B
Curvalicious, pussy served delicious
Mayday, mayday, Earth to bitches
Slap these hoes on they ass, like we birthing bitches
UHN! The Queen of Rap, slayin' with Queen B
If you ain't on the team, you playin' for team D
'Cause we A-listers, uh we paid sisters
This watch right here, done phased blizzards
I confess, I woke up like this
All this drank in my cup like this
All this ass on that flawless dick
Instagram, another flawless pic
Flawless city, with these flawless titties
I got all these hundreds, you got all them fifties
I'm with some flawless bitches, 'cause they more than pretty
'Cause niggas love bad bitches that be on they grizzly
Throw that ass back, I be on my frisbee
Princess-cut diamonds, on my Disney
He want "Monster Nicki", in Sri Lanka
I told him, "Meet me at the Trump, Ivanka"
I said "Come here, let me show you, how this cookie taste"
This that, "Yeah nigga, eat the cookie" face

[Outro]
[Verse 1]
If I were a boy
Even just for a day
I'd roll out of bed in the morning
And throw on what I wanted then go
Drink beer with the guys
And chase after girls
I'd kick it with who I wanted
And I'd never get confronted for it
'Cause they'd stick up for me

[Chorus 1]
If I were a boy
I think I could understand
How it feels to love a girl
I swear I'd be a better man
I'd listen to her
'Cause I know how it hurts
When you lose the one you wanted
'Cause he's taken you for granted
And everything you had got destroyed

[Verse 2]
If I were a boy
I would turn off my phone
Tell everyone it's broken
So they'd think that I was sleepin' alone
I'd put myself first
And make the rules as I go
'Cause I'd know that she'd be faithful
Waitin' for me to come home
To come home

[Chorus 1]
If I were a boy
I think I could understand
How it feels to love a girl
I swear I'd be a better man
I'd listen to her
'Cause I know how it hurts
When you lose the one you wanted 
'Cause he's taken you for granted 
And everything you had got destroyed

[Bridge]
It's a little too late for you to come back
Say, it's just a mistake
Think I'd forgive you like that
If you thought I would wait for you
You thought wrong

[Chorus 2]
But you're just a boy
You don't understand

How it feels to love a girl
Someday, you'll wish you were a better man
You don't listen to her
You don't care how it hurts
Until you lose the one you wanted
'Cause you've taken her for granted
And everything you have got destroyed
But you're just a boy...

[Verse 1]
You can taste the dishonesty
It's all over your breath as you pass it off so cavalier
But even that's a test
Constantly aware of it all
My lonely ear pressed against the walls of your world

[Chorus]
Pray to catch you whispering
I pray you catch me listening
I'm prayin' to catch you whispering
I pray you catch me
I'm prayin' to catch you whispering
I pray you catch me listening
I pray you catch me

[Verse 2]
Nothing else ever seems to hurt like the smile on your face
When it's only in my memory, it don't hit me quite the same
Maybe it's a cause for concern, but I'm not at ease
Keeping my head to the curb

[Chorus]
Pray to catch you whispering
I pray you catch me listening
I pray to catch you whispering 
I pray you catch me 
I pray you catch me
I pray you catch me 
I'm praying you catch me

[Outro]
What are you doing, my love?

[Verse 1]
I found the truth beneath your lies
And true love never has to hide
True love never has to hide
I'll trade your broken wings for mine
Trade your broken wings for mine
I've seen your scars and kissed your crime, oh
Seen your scars and kissed your crime

[Pre-Chorus]
So many people that I know, they're just tryna touch ya
Kiss up and rub up and feel up
Kiss up and rub up and feel up on you
Give you some time to prove that I can trust you again
I'm gonna kiss up and rub up and feel up
Kiss up and rub up and feel up on you

[Chorus]
All night long
Love all night long
Sweet love all night long
Sweet love all night long
All I wanna, ain't no other
We together, I remember
Sweet love all night long

[Verse 2]
Our love was stronger than your pride
Beyond your darkness, I'm your light, oh
If you get deep, you touch my mind
If you get deep, you touch my mind
Baptize your tears and dry your eyes, oh
Baptize your tears and dry your eyes

[Pre-Chorus]
So many people, I know that they're just tryna touch ya
Kiss up and rub up and feel up
Kiss up and rub up and feel up on you
Give you some time to prove that I can trust you again
I'm gonna kiss up and rub up and feel up
Kiss up and rub up and feel up on you

[Chorus]
All night long
Love all night long
Sweet love all night long
Sweet love all night long
All I wanna, ain't no other
We together, I remember
Sweet love all night long

[Bridge]
They say true love's the greatest weapon
To win the war caused by pain, pain
But every diamond has imperfections
But my love's too pure to watch it chip away
Boy, nothing real can be threatened
True love breathes salvation back into me
With every tear came redemption
And my torturer became my remedy

[Pre-Chorus]
So many people, I know that they're just tryna touch ya
Kiss up and rub up and feel up
Kiss up and rub up and feel up on you
Give you some time to prove that I can trust you again
I'm gonna kiss up and rub up and feel up
Kiss up and rub up and feel up on you

[Chorus]
All night long
Love all night long
Sweet love all night long
Sweet love all night long
All I wanna, ain't no other
We together, I remember
Sweet love all night long

[Outro]
How I missed you, my love

[Intro: Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie]
We teach girls to shrink themselves, to make themselves smaller
We say to girls: "You can have ambition, but not too much
You should aim to be successful, but not too successful
Otherwise, you will threaten the man"
Because I am female, I am expected to aspire to marriage
I am expected to make my life choices
Always keeping in mind that marriage is the most important
Now, marriage can be a source of joy and love and mutual support
But why do we teach girls to aspire to marriage
And we don't teach boys the same?
We raise girls to see each other as competitors
Not for jobs or for accomplishments, which I think can be a good thing
But for the attention of men
We teach girls that they cannot be sexual beings in the way that boys are
Feminist: a person who believes in the social, political
And economic equality of the sexes

[Chorus: Beyonce]
You wake up, flawless
Post up, flawless
Ridin' 'round in it, flawless
Flossin' on that, flawless
This diamond, flawless
My diamond, flawless
This rock, flawless
My Roc, flawless
I woke up like this, I woke up like this
We flawless, ladies tell 'em
I woke up like this, I woke up like this
We flawless, ladies tell 'em
Say "I look so good tonight"
God damn, God damn
Say "I look so good tonight"
God damn, God damn, God damn!

[Bridge: Beyonce]
Mama taught me good home training
My Daddy taught me how to love my haters
My sister told me I should speak my mind
My man made me feel so God damn fine 

[Chorus: Beyonce]
You wake up, flawless
Post up, flawless
Ridin' round in it, flawless
Flossin' on that, flawless
This diamond, flawless
My diamond, flawless
This rock, flawless
My Roc, flawless
I woke up like this, I woke up like this
We flawless, ladies tell 'em
I woke up like this, I woke up like this
We flawless, ladies tell 'em

God damn, God damn
Say "I look so good tonight"
God damn, God damn, God damn!

Remember those walls I built?
Well, baby, they're tumblin' down

I found a way to let you in
But I never really had a doubt
Standin' in the light of your halo

Gravity can't begin
To pull me back to the ground again

I'm never gonna shut you out

Tryna rain, tryna rain on the thunder
Tell the storm I'm new
I'ma walk, I'ma march on the regular
Painting white flags blue
Lord, forgive me, I've been running
Running blind in truth
I'ma rain, I'ma rain on this bitter love
Tell the sweet I'm new

[Pre-Chorus: Beyonc]
I'm telling these tears, "Go and fall away, fall away," oh
May the last one burn into flames

[Chorus: Beyonc]
Freedom! Freedom! I can't move
Freedom, cut me loose! Yeah
Freedom! Freedom! Where are you?
'Cause I need freedom, too!
I break chains all by myself
Won't let my freedom rot in hell
Hey! I'ma keep running
'Cause a winner don't quit on themselves

[Verse 2: Beyonc]
I'ma wade, I'ma wave through the waters
Tell the tide, "Don't move"
I'ma riot, I'ma riot through your borders
Call me bulletproof
Lord, forgive me, I've been runnin'
Runnin' blind in truth
I'ma wade, I'ma wave through your shallow love
Tell the deep I'm new

I'm telling these tears, "Go and fall away, fall away," oh

Cause a winner don't quit on themselves

[Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar]
Ten Hail Marys, I meditate for practice
Channel 9 news tell me I'm movin' backwards
Eight blocks left, death is around the corner
Seven misleadin' statements 'bout my persona
Six headlights wavin' in my direction 
Five-O askin' me what's in my possession
Yeah, I keep runnin', jump in the aqueducts
Fire hydrants and hazardous
Smoke alarms on the back of us
But mama, don't cry for me, ride for me
Try for me, live for me
Breathe for me, sing for me
Honestly guidin' me
I could be more than I gotta be
Stole from me, lied to me, nation hypocrisy
Code on me, drive on me
Wicked, my spirit inspired me, like yeah
Open correctional gates in higher desert 
Open our mind as we cast away oppression 
Open the streets and watch our beliefs
And when they carve my name inside the concrete
I pray it forever reads

[Chorus: Beyonc]
Freedom! Freedom! I can't move
Freedom, cut me loose!
Freedom! Freedom! Where are you?
'Cause I need freedom, too!
I break chains all by myself
Won't let my freedom rot in hell
Hey! I'ma keep running
'Cause a winner don't quit on themselves

[Outro: Kendrick Lamar]
What you want from me?
Is it truth you seek? Oh, father, can you hear me?
What you want from me?
Is it truth you seek? Oh, father, can you hear me?
Hear me out

[Spoken: Hattie White]
I had my ups and downs, but I always find the inner strength to pull myself up. I was served lemons, but I made lemonade.

[Verse 1]
Let me sit this ass on you, show you how I feel
Let me take this off, will you watch me
Yes, mass appeal
Don't take your eyes, don't take your eyes off it
Watch it, babe
If you like, you can touch me, baby
Do you, do you wanna touch me, baby?
Grab a hold, don't let go
Let me know, that you, ready
I just wanna show you now, slow it down, go around
You rock hard, I rock steady

[Chorus]
And rock right up to, the side of my mountain
Climb until you reach my peak, baby, peak, baby, peak
And reach right into the bottom of my fountain
I wanna play in your deep, baby, your deep, baby, deep
Then dip me under where you can feel my river flow and flow
Hold me 'til I scream for air to breathe
And wash me over until my well runs dry
Send all your sins all over me, babe, over me

[Bridge]
Rock it 'til waterfalls
Rock it 'til waterfalls
Rock it 'til waterfalls
Bathe in these waterfalls

[Verse 2]
I do it like it's my profession
I gotta make a confession
I'm proud of all this bass, when you put it in your face
By the way, if you need a personal trainer or a therapist
I can be a piece of sunshine, inner peace, entertainer
Anything else that you may read between the lines
You and I create rockets and waterfalls

[Chorus]
And rock right up to, the side of my mountain
Climb until you reach my peak, baby, peak, baby, peak
And reach right into the bottom of my fountain
I wanna play in your deep, baby, your deep, baby, deep
Then dip me under where you can feel my river flow and flow
Hold me 'til I scream for air to breathe
And wash me over until my well runs dry
Send all your sins all over me babe, over me

[Interlude]
Hard, rock, steady, rock, hard, rock, steady
Rock, hard, rock, steady, rock, hard, rock, steady

[Verse 3]
Don't you know that I give you the loving if you need it
I give you my word, you can believe it
Your love feels like all four seasons growing inside me
Life has a reason, swimming in my love, your love lifting
Higher, harder
Got me screaming to the Lord, boy
Kiss me, pray we don't overflow
Baby, I know you can feel it pulse
Keeping the peak of my waterfall
Rock it, baby, rock it, baby, rock it 'til the water falls
Damn

[Verse 4]
I can't help but love the way we make love
Daddy, daddy
Ooh child, ooh now, yes Lord, damn baby
Driving me cray, cray
You ain't right for doing it to me like that daddy
Even though I've been a bad, bad, bad, bad, bad, bad, bad, bad, bad, bad, bad, bad girl
Tell me what you're gonna do about that
Punish me, please
Punish me please
Daddy, what you gon' do with all this ass
All up in your face?
Yeah, hell yeah, ride me so deep
Ooh, my shit's so good that it ain't even right
I know I'm right
Hell yeah, you the shit
That's why you're my equivalent
So sexy
We're so much more than pointless fixtures
Instagram pictures, consumers
What about that ching-ching-ching
Wanna rock that, wanna rock that ching-ching
Baby boomers, baby, baby, baby, baby
Cyclical trends, tryna fit in
Home is where the heart is
Goddamnit, I'm comfortable in my skin
And you're comfortable in my skin
You look so comfortable in my skin
Rockets and waterfalls

[Outro]
Damn

[Intro]
I love your face
You love the taste
That sugar babe, it melts away

[Verse 1]
I kiss you and you lick your lips, I kiss you and you lick your lips
You like it wet and so do I, You like it wet and so do I
I know you never waste a drip, I know you never waste a drip
I wonder how it feels sometimes
Must be good to you

[Pre-Chorus]
Keep me coming, keep me going, keep me coming, keep me going
Keep me humming, keep me moaning, keep me humming, keep me moaning
Don't stop loving 'til the morning, don't stop loving 'til the morning
Don't stop screaming, freaking, blowing

[Chorus]
Can you eat my skittles?
It's the sweetest in the middle 
Pink is the flavor
Solve the riddle 
I'm-a lean back
Don't worry, it's nothing major
Make sure you clean that
It's the only way to get the
Flavor

[Verse 2]
When you're thirsty and need love
I give it up 'til I'm empty babe
Must be good to you
If you're lonely in your bed, fill it up to the top
Must be good to you

[Pre-Chorus]
Keep me coming, keep me going, keep me coming, keep me going
Keep me humming, keep me moaning, keep me humming, keep me moaning
Don't stop loving 'til the morning, don't stop loving 'til the morning
Don't stop screaming, freaking, blowing

[Chorus]
Can you eat my skittles?
It's the sweetest in the middle 
Pink is the flavor
Solve the riddle 
I'm-a lean back
Don't worry, it's nothing major
Make sure you clean that
It's the only way to get the
Flavor

Keep me humming, keep me moaning, keep me humming, keep me moaning
Don't stop loving 'til the morning, don't stop loving 'til the morning

It's the sweetest in the middle 
Pink is the flavor
Solve the riddle

[Verse 1: Beyonc]
Who the fuck do you think I is?
You ain't married to no average bitch, boy
You can watch my fat ass twist, boy
As I bounce to the next dick, boy
And keep your money, I got my own
Keep a bigger smile on my face being alone

'Til I realize I'm just too much for you
I'm just too much for you

[Pre-Chorus 2: Beyonc]
You just got to let it be
Let it be, let it be, let it be, baby
Hey baby, who the fuck do you think I is?
I smell that fragrance on your Louis knit, boy
Just give my fat ass a big kiss, boy
Tonight I'm fucking up all your shit, boy

[Chorus: Beyonc & Jack White]
When you hurt me, you hurt yourself
Try not to hurt yourself
When you play me, you play yourself
Don't play yourself
When you lie to me, you lie to yourself
You only lying to yourself 
When you love me, you love yourself

[Outro: Beyonc]
We just got to let it be
Let it be, let it be, let it be, let it be, babe
Uh, this is your final warning 
You know I give you life 
If you try this shit again 
You gon' lose your wife

[Verse 1]
We built sandcastles that washed away
I made you cry when I walked away, oh
And although I promised that I couldn't stay, baby
Every promise don't work out that way, oh, babe
Every promise don't work out that way

[Verse 2]
Dishes smashed on my counter from our last encounter
Pictures snatched out the frame
Bitch, I scratched out your name and your face
What is it about you that I can't erase, baby?
When every promise don't work out that way, no no, babe
When every promise don't work out that way

[Verse 3]
And your heart is broken 'cause I walked away
Show me your scars and I won't walk away, oh
And I know I promised that I couldn't stay, baby
Every promise don't work out that way, no, no, no, no, no
Every promise don't work out that way[Pre-Chorus]

Six inch heels, she walked in the club like nobody's business
Goddamn, she murdered everybody and I was her witness

[Verse 1: The Weeknd]
She's stacking money, money everywhere she goes
You know, pesos out of Mexico
De uno, commas and them decimals
She don't gotta give it up, she professional
She mixing up that Ace with that Hennessy
She love the way it tastes, that's her recipe
Rushing through her veins like it's ecstasy 
She already made enough, but she'll never leave

[Chorus: Beyonc]
Six inch heels, she walked in the club like nobody's business
Goddamn, she murdered everybody and I was her witness

And she worth every dollar, she worth every dollar
And she worth every minute

[Post-Chorus: Belly]
She work for the money
She work for the money
She work for the money

Stars in her eyes
She fights for the power, keeping time

She too smart to crave material things
She pushing herself day and night
She grinds from Monday to Friday
Work from Friday to Sunday, oh

She fights and she sweats those sleepless nights
But she don't mind, she loves the grind

Stacking her paper, stacking her cake up
She grinds from Monday to Friday

[Verse 1]
Ten times out of nine, I know youre lying
But nine times out of ten, I know you're trying
So I'm trying to be fair
And you're trying to be there and to care
And you're caught up in your permanent emotions
And all the loving I've been giving goes unnoticed
It's just floating in the air, lookie there
Are you aware you're my lifeline, are you tryna kill me?
If I wasn't me, would you still feel me?
Like on my worst day? Or am I not thirsty, enough?
I don't care about the lights or the beams
Spend my life in the dark for the sake of you and me
Only way to go is up, skin thick, too tough, mmm

[Chorus]
'Cause you, you, you, you and me could move a mountain
You, you, you, you and me could calm a war down
You, you, you, you and me could make it rain now
You, you, you, you and me could stop this love drought

[Verse 2]
Nine times out of ten, I'm in my feelings
But ten times out of nine, I'm only human
Tell me, what did I do wrong?
Feel like that question has been posed, I'm movin' on
I always been committed, I been focused
I always paid attention, been devoted
Tell me, what did I do wrong?
Oh, already asked that, my bad
But you my lifeline, think you tryna kill me
If I wasn't B, would you still feel me?
Like on my worst day? Or am I not thirsty, enough?
I don't care about the lights or the beams
Spend my life in the dark for the sake of you and me
Only way to go is up, them old bitches so wack
I'm so tough, wassup?

[Chorus]
'Cause you, you, you, you and me could move a mountain
You, you, you, you and me could calm a war down
You, you, you, you and me could make it rain now
And you, you, you, you and me will stop this love drought

[Outro]
You, you, you, you and me will stop this love drought
You, you, you, you and me will stop this love drought

[Intro: Harvey Keitel & Beyonc]
Ms. Third Ward, your first question:
What is your aspiration in life?
Oh, well my aspiration in life would be... to be happy

[Verse 1]
Mama said, "You're a pretty girl
What's in your head, it doesn't matter
Brush your hair, fix your teeth
What you wear is all that matters"

[Pre-Chorus]
Just another stage
Pageant the pain away
This time I'm gonna take the crown
Without falling down, down, down

[Chorus]
Pretty hurts
We shine the light on whatever's worst
Perfection is a disease of a nation
Pretty hurts, pretty hurts
Pretty hurts
We shine the light on whatever's worst
Tryna fix something
But you can't fix what you can't see
It's the soul that needs a surgery

[Verse 2]
Blonder hair, flat chest
TV says bigger is better
South beach, sugar free
Vogue says thinner is better

[Pre-Chorus]
Just another stage, pageant the pain away
This time I'm gonna take the crown
Without falling down, down, down

[Chorus]
Pretty hurts
We shine the light on whatever's worst
Perfection is a disease of a nation
Pretty hurts, pretty hurts
Pretty hurts
We shine the light on whatever's worst
We try to fix something
But you can't fix what you can't see
It's the soul that needs the surgery

[Bridge]
Aint got no doctor or pill that can take the pain away
The pain's inside and nobody frees you from your body
It's the soul, it's the soul that needs surgery

Plastic smiles and denial can only take you so far
Then you break when the fake faade leaves you in the dark
You left with shattered mirrors and the shards of a beautiful girl

[Chorus]
Pretty hurts
We shine the light on whatever's worst
Perfection is a disease of a nation
Pretty hurts, pretty hurts
Pretty hurts
We shine the light on whatever's worst
Tryna fix something
But you can't fix what you can't see
It's the soul that needs a surgery

[Outro]
When you're alone all by yourself
And you're lying in your bed
Reflection stares right into you
Are you happy with yourself?
You stripped away the masquerade
The illusion has been shed
Are you happy with yourself?
Are you happy with yourself?
Yeah, yes

Yeah, tonight I see some super freaky hoes
That could go from bein' stripper to a super CEO

And you always told your girlfriends you need you a TV show
Now you got your own money, you don't need nobody else
But far as handlin' all that ass, I think you gon' need some help
Let me remind you, you got a, you got a great future behind you
You gotta tell me what we tryna do

I know good pussy when I see it, I'm a visionary
I know them haters talkin', always had us very wary
Yup! On the 35th of Nevuary
Yup! You love the way I'm turnt
After all the money you earned, still show daddy what you learned
That cowgirl, you reverse that cowgirl
You reverse, you reverse, and I impregnated your mouth, girl
Ooooh, that's when I knew you could be my spouse, girl
We fuckin' all over the house, girl
We just messed up a brand new couch, girl
If you ain't on site, then you on Skype
I put you on that bike, you bound, girl
We too wild, won't turn down
We drunk in love, fuck them

[Verse 2: Beyonc]
I've been drinkin', I've been drinkin'
I get filthy when that liquor get into me

Why can't I keep my fingers off it, baby?
I want you, na na
Why can't I keep my fingers off you, baby?
I want you, na na
Cigars on ice, cigars on ice
Feelin' like an animal with these cameras all in my grill
Flashin' lights, flashin' lights
You got me faded, faded, faded
Baby, I want you, na na
Can't keep your eyes off my fatty
Daddy, I want you, na na
Drunk in love, I want you

[Pre-Chorus: Beyonc]
We woke up in the kitchen
Sayin', "How the hell did this shit happen?"
Oh baby, drunk in love
We be all night, last thing I remember
Is our beautiful bodies
Grindin' up in that club, drunk in love

[Chorus: Beyonc]
We be all night, love, love
We be all night, love, love

[Verse 3: Beyonc]
We be all night, and everything all right
No complaints from my body
So fluorescent under these lights
Boy, I'm drinkin', park it in my lot, 7-11
I'm rubbin' on it, rub-rubbin'
If you scared, call that reverend
Boy, I'm drinkin', get my brain right
Armand de Brignac, gangster wife
Louis sheets, he sweat it out
Like washrags, he wear it out
Boy, I'm drinkin', I'm singin' on the mic to my boy's toys
Then I fill the tub up halfway
Then ride it with my surfboard, surfboard, surfboard
Grainin' on that wood
Grainin', grainin' on that wood
I'm swervin' on that, swervin', swervin' on that
Big body Benz servin' all this
Swerve, surfin' all in this good-good

[Pre-Chorus: Beyonc]
We woke up in the kitchen
Sayin', "How the hell did this shit happen?"
Oh baby, drunk in love
We be all night, last thing I remember
Is our beautiful bodies
Grindin' up in that club, drunk in love

[Chorus: Beyonc & JAY-Z]
We be all night, love, love
We be all night, love, love
I'm nice now... hold up!

[Verse 4: JAY-Z]
That D'uss is the shit if I do say so myself
If I do say so myself, if I do say so myself
Hold up, stumble all in the house
Time to back up all that mouth
That you had all in the car
Talking 'bout you the baddest bitch thus far
Talking 'bout you be reppin' that Third
I wanna see all that shit that I heard
Know I sling Clint Eastwood
Hope you can handle this curve
Uh, foreplay in a foyer, fucked up my Warhol
Slid the panties right to the side
Ain't got the time to take drawers off
On sight, catch a charge I might
Beat the box up like Mike in '97 I bite
I'm Ike Turner, turn up, baby, no, I don't play
"Now eat the cake, Anna Mae!"
Said, "Eat the cake, Anna Mae!"
I'm nice, for y'all to reach these heights
You gon' need G3, 4, 5, 6 flights
Sleep tight, we sex again in the morning
Your breasteses is my breakfast
We goin' in, we be all night

[Chorus: Beyonc]
We be all night, love, love
We be all night, love, love

[Bridge: Beyonc]
I'm never tired, never tired

That's keepin' me on fire, we on fire

Daddy, I want you, right now
Can't keep your eyes off my fatty
Daddy, I want you

[Chorus: Beyonc]
We be all night, love, love

[Verse 1]
Listen to the song here in my heart
A melody I start, but can't complete
Listen to the sound from deep within
It's only beginning to find release

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh the time has come for my dreams to be heard
They will not be pushed aside and turned
Into your own, all 'cause you won't listen

[Chorus]
Listen, I am alone at a crossroads
I'm not at home in my own home
And I've tried and tried
To say what's on my mind
You should have known, oh
Now I'm done believin' you
You don't know what I'm feelin'
I'm more than what
You've made of me
I followed the voice you gave to me
But now I've gotta find my own
You should have listened

[Verse 2]
There was someone here inside
Someone I thought had died
So long ago

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, I'm screamin' out
And my dreams will be heard
They will not be pushed aside or turned
Into your own
All 'cause you won't listen

[Chorus]
Listen. I am alone at a crossroads
I'm not at home in my own home
And I've tried and tried
To say what's on my mind
You should have known, oh
Now I'm done believin' you
You don't know what I'm feelin'
I'm more than what
You've made of me
I followed the voice you gave to me
But now I've gotta find my own

[Bridge]
I don't know where I belong
But I'll be moving on
If you don't, if you won't

[Chorus]
Listen to the song here in my heart
A melody I start, but I will complete
Now I'm done believin' you
You don't know what I'm feelin'
I'm more than what you made of me
I followed the voice you think you gave to me
But now I've gotta find my own, my own

[Intro: Young Beyonc & ]

I would like to thank the judges for picking me
My parents who I love, I love you, Houston

[Verse 1]
And I've been drifting off on knowledge
Cat-calls on cat-walks, man these women getting solemn
I could sing a song for a Solomon or Salamander
We took a flight at midnight and now my mind can't help but wonder:
How come?
Spoon-fed pluralized eyes to find the beaches in the forest
When I'm looking off the edge, I preach my gut it can't help but ignore it
I'm climbing up the walls cause all the shit I hear is boring
All the shit I do is boring, all these record labels boring
I don't trust these record labels, I'm torn
All these people on the planet working 9 to 5 just to stay alive
The 9 to 5 just to stay alive, the 9 to 5 just to stay alive
The 9 to 5 just to stay alive, the 9 to 5 just to stay alive
The 9 to 5 just to stay alive, the 9 to 5 just to stay alive
All the people on the planet working 9 to 5 just to stay alive, how come?

[Chorus]
What goes up ghost around
Ghost around, around, around, around
What goes up ghost around
Ghost around, around, around, around
What goes up ghost around
Ghost around, around, around, around

[Bridge]
Around, around, around, around, around, around, around
Around, around, around, around, around, around, around
Around, around, around, around, around, around, around

[Outro]
Soul not for sale
Probably won't make no money off this, oh well
Reap what you sow
Perfection is so, mmm

Part 2: Haunted

[Verse 1]
It's what you do, it's what you see
I know if I'm haunting you, you must be haunting me
It's where we go, it's where we'll be
I know if I'm onto you, I'm onto you
Onto you, you must be on to me
My haunted lungs, ghost in the sheets
I know if I'm onto you, you must be haunting me
My wicked tongue, where will it be?
I know if I'm onto you, I'm on to you
Onto you, I'm onto you
Onto you, you must be on to me

[Bridge]
You want me? I walk down the hallway
You like it? The bedroom's my runway
Slap me! I'm pinned to the doorway
Kiss, bite, foreplay

[Verse 2]
My haunted lungs, ghost in the sheets
I know if I'm haunting you, you must be haunting me
My wicked tongue, where will it be?
I know if I'm onto you, you must be onto me
It's what we see
I know if I'm haunting you, you must be haunting me
It's where we go, it's where we'll be
I know if I'm onto you, I'm onto you
Onto you, I'm onto you
Onto you, you must be onto me
You must be onto me
You must be onto me
You must be onto me

[Outro]
On to you, I'm on to you
On to you, I'm on to you
On to you, I'm on to you
On to you, I'm on to you
Me, me, me

[Verse 1]
I'm in my penthouse half-naked
I cooked this meal for you naked
So where the hell you at?
Just one shot left of this drink, in this glass
Don't make me break it
I wish that you were me
So you could feel this feeling
I never broke one promise, and I know when you're not honest
Now you got me yelling that's because I'm jealous

[Chorus]
If you keeping your promise, I'm keeping mine
Oh, I'm jealous
If you keeping your promise, I'm keeping mine
Oh, I'm jealous

[Post-Chorus]
Sometimes I wanna walk in your shoes
Do the type of things that I never ever do
So I take one look in the mirror and I say to myself
"Baby girl, you can't survive like this, no"

[Verse 2]
Take it one step further, freakum dress out my closet
Yonc fillin' out this skirt, I look damn good, I ain't lost it
And I ain't missed a beat, boy, you been hanging out at night
Tonight I'm staying out 'til tomorrow
Dancing on them tables ain't got no cares, no sorrow
I ran into my ex, said what up to his besties
Now we reminiscing how we used to flex in Texas, don't be jealous

[Chorus]
If you keeping your promise, I'm keeping mine
Oh, I'm jealous
If you keeping your promise, I'm keeping mine
Oh, I'm jealous

[Post-Chorus]
Sometimes I wanna walk in your shoes
Do the type of things that I never ever do
So I take one look in the mirror and I say to myself
"Baby girl, you can't survive like this, no"

[Bridge]
And I hate you for your lies and your covers
And I hate us for making good love to each other

That ain't nothing
I'm just jealous, I'm just human, don't judge me

I look and stare so deep in your eyes 
I touch on you more and more every time
When you leave, I'm begging you not to go
Call your name, two, three times in a row
Such a funny thing for me to try to explain
How I'm feeling, and my pride is the one to blame 
'Cause I know I don't understand
Just how your love can do what no one else can

[Chorus: Beyonc]
Got me looking so crazy right now
Your love's got me looking so crazy right now

[Verse 2: Beyonc]
When I talk to my friends so quietly
 Look at what you did to me
Tennis shoes, don't even need to buy a new dress
If you ain't there, ain't nobody else to impress
It's the way that you know what I thought I knew
It's the beat that my heart skips when I'm with you
But I still don't understand
Just how your love can do what no one else can

[Chorus: Beyonc & Jay-Z]
Got me looking so crazy right now
Your love's got me looking so crazy right now

Got me looking so crazy right now 
Your touch got me looking so crazy right now

Stick bony, but the pockets is fat like Tony 
Soprano, the ROC handle like Van Exel
I shake phonies man you can't get next to
The genuine article, I do not sing though
I sling though, if anything, I bling yo
A star like Ringo, war like a Green Beret
You crazy? Bring ya whole set
JAY-Z in the Range, crazy and deranged
They can't figure him out, they like, "Hey, is he insane?" 
Yes sir, I'm cut from a different cloth
My texture is the best fur: chinchilla
I've been iller than chain smokers
How you think I got the name Hova?
I been realer, the game's over
Fall back, Young
Ever since I made the change over to platinum
The game's been a wrap, one

[Bridge: Beyonc]
Got me looking, so crazy, my baby
I'm not myself lately, I'm foolish, I don't do this
I've been playing myself, baby, I don't care
'Cause your love's got the best of me
And baby you're making a fool of me
You got me sprung and I don't care who sees
'Cause baby you got me, you got me
You got me, you got me so crazy, baby
Hey!

[Chorus: Beyonce]
Got me looking so crazy right now
Your love's got me looking so crazy right now 
Got me looking so crazy right now

Got me hoping you'll page me right now
Your kiss got me hoping you'll save me right now
Looking so crazy, your love's got me looking
Got me looking so crazy in love

Got me hoping you'll page me right now
Your kiss got me hoping you'll save me right now
Looking so crazy, your love's got me looking
Got me looking so crazy in love

[Verse 1: Beyonc]
Sometimes these walls seem to cave in on me
When I look in your eyes, I feel alive
Some days we say words that don't mean a thing
But when you holding me tight, I feel alive

[Chorus: Beyonc]
Make it last forever
Come on, baby, won't you hold on to me, hold on to me?
You and I together
Come on, baby, won't you hold on to me, hold on to me?

When I'm holding you tight, I'm so alive
Now let's live it up

You know I used to beat that block
Now I be's the block 

[Verse 1: Beyonc]
I hear you be the block, but I'm the lights that keep the streets on
Notice you the type that like to keep them on a leash though
I'm known to walk alone, but I'm alone for a reason
Sending me a drink ain't appeasing, believe me
Come harder, this won't be easy
Don't doubt yourself, trust me, you need me
This ain't a shoulder with a chip or a ego
But what you think they all mad at me for?

[Pre-Chorus: Beyonc]
You need a real woman in your life 
Taking care of home and still fly 
I'mma help you build up your account

It take me just to compliment the deals 
Anything you cop, I'll split the bill


[Chorus: Beyonc]
Partner, let me upgrade you, Audemars Piguet you
Switch your neck ties to purple labels

I can up, can I up, let me upgrade you?
Partner, let me upgrade you

[Verse 2: Beyonc]
I can do for you, what Martin did for the people
Ran by the men, but the women keep the tempo
It's very seldom that you're blessed to find your equals
Still play my part and let you take the lead role, believe me

I'll be the help, whenever you need me 
I see your hustle with my hustle, I can keep you
Focused on your focus, I can feed you

I be the d-boy who infiltrated all the corporate dudes
They call shots, I call audibles

It's big balling, baby, when I'm courting you
I'm talking spy bags and fly pads
And rooms at the Bloomberg, and rumors
You on the verge of a new merge
'Cause that rock on ya finger's like a tumor
You can't fit ya hand in ya new purse
It's humorous to me, they watching and we just yachting
Island-hopping off the Amalfi coast
Mafioso, Hov, baby, you ever seen Saturn?
No, not the car, but everywhere we are
You're sure to see stars, this is high level
Not eye-level, my bezel courtesy of Audemars
I order yours tomorrow, now look at the time I saved you
Mama, let me upgrade you 

[Bridge: Beyonc]
Just when you think we had it all
Big ends, condos, collecting cars
Picture your life elevating with me
Now you my project celebrity
I keep ya name hot in them streets
That little glimpse of light
Makes that diamond really shine
And you already is a star, but unless you're flawless
Then ya dynasty ain't complete without a chief, like me

[Verse 1: Beyonc]
When the palm of my two hands hold each other
That feels different
From when your hands are in mine
That's just the way it is
And when my voice is screaming out to my own ears
That feels different from when I hear yours
Now that's just the way it is
And when I'm standing in this mirror after all these years
What I'm viewing is a little different
From what your eyes show you
I guess I didn't see myself before you
Moving forward

They can't break us down

[Verse 2: Beyonc]
And just like you I can be scared
Just like you I hope I'm spared
But it's tough love
I know you feel it in the air
Even the babies know it's there: tough love 
The laws of the world tell us what goes sky
And what falls, it's a superpower 
The laws of the world never stopped us once
'Cause together we got plenty superpower

[Bridge 2: Beyonc & ]

A subtle power

A tough love

'Cause you're no angel either, baby

[Outro]
No, no, no, no
No, no, no, no
No, no, no, no
No, no, no, no

No, no, no, no
No, no, no, no
No, no, no, no
No, no, no, no, no, no...

[Intro]
To the left, to the left
To the left, to the left 

[Verse 1]
To the left, to the left
Everything you own in the box to the left
In the closet, that's my stuff
Yes, if I bought it, please don't touch 
And keep talking that mess that's fine
But could you walk and talk at the same time
And, it's my name that's on that jag
So remove your bags, let me call you a cab

[Pre-Chorus]
Standing in the front yard
Tellin' me, how I'm such a fool
Talkin' 'bout, how I'll never ever find a man like you
You got me twisted

[Chorus]
You must not know about me, you must not know about me
I could have another you in a minute
Matter of fact, he'll be here in a minute, baby
You must not know about me, you must not know about me
I can have another you by tomorrow
So don't you ever for a second get to thinking
You're irreplaceable

[Verse 2]
So go ahead and get gone
Call up that chick and see if she's home
Oops, I bet you thought, that I didn't know
What did you think I was putting you out for?
'Cause you was untrue
Rollin' her around in the car that I bought you
Baby, drop them keys
Hurry up before your taxi leaves

[Pre-Chorus]
Standing in the front yard
Tellin' me, how I'm such a fool
Talkin' 'bout, how I'll never ever find a man like you
You got me twisted

[Chorus]
You must not know about me, you must not know about me
I could have another you in a minute
Matter of fact, he'll be here in a minute, baby
You must not know about me, you must not know about me
I will have another you by tomorrow
So don't you ever for a second get to thinking
You're irreplaceable 

[Bridge]
So since I'm not your everything 
How about I'll be nothing 
Nothing at all to you 
Baby, I won't shed a tear for you 
I won't lose a wink of sleep
'Cause the truth of the matter is
Replacing you was so easy

[Interlude]
To the left, to the left
To the left, to the left 
To the left, to the left
Everything you own in the box to the left
To the left, to the left
Don't you ever for a second get to thinking
You're irreplaceable

[Chorus]
You must not know about me, you must not know about me
I could have another you in a minute
Matter of fact, he'll be here in a minute, baby
You must not know about me, you must not know about me
I can have another you by tomorrow
So don't you ever for a second get to thinking 
You must not know about me, you must not know about me
I could have another you in a minute
Matter of fact, he'll be here in a minute
You can pack all your bags 
We're finished 
'Cause you made your bed
Now lay in it
I can have another you by tomorrow
Don't you ever for a second get to thinking
You're irreplaceable

[Intro]
Bring the beat in

[Verse 1]
Honey, honey
I can see the stars all the way from here
Can't you see the glow on the window pane?
I can feel the sun whenever you're near
Every time you touch me, I just melt away

[Pre-Chorus]
Now everybody asks me why I'm smiling out from ear to ear
 But I know
 Oh
Nothing's perfect, but it's worth it
After fighting through my tears
And finally you put me first

[Chorus 1]
Baby, it's you, you're the one I love
You're the one I need, you're the only one I see
Come on, baby, it's you
You're the one that gives your all
You're the one I can always call
When I need you, make everything stop
Finally, you put my love on top

[Post-Chorus]
Ooh, come on, baby!
You put my love on top, top, top, top, top
You put my love on top
Ooh, come on, baby!
You put my love on top, top, top, top, top
You put my love on top

[Verse 2]
Baby, baby, I can feel the wind whipping past my face
As we dance the night away
Boy, your lips taste like a night of champagne
As I kiss you again, and again, and again, and again

[Pre-Chorus]
Now everybody asks me why I'm smiling out from ear to ear
 But I know
 Oh
Nothing's perfect, but it's worth it
After fighting through my tears
And finally you put me first

[Chorus 1]
Baby, it's you, you're the one I love
You're the one I need, you're the only one I see
Come on, baby, it's you 
You're the one that gives your all
You're the one I can always call
When I need you, make everything stop
Finally, you put my love on top

[Post-Chorus]
Ooh, baby!
You put my love on top, top, top, top, top
You put my love on top
Ooh, come on, baby!
You put my love on top, top, top, top, top
You put my love on top

[Chorus 2]
Baby, it's you, you're the one I love
You're the one I need, you're the only thing I see
Come on, baby, it's you 
You're the one that gives your all
You're the one that always call
When I need you, baby, everything stops
Finally, you put my love on top
Baby, you're the one that I love
Baby, you're all I need
You're the only one I see
Come on, baby, it's you
You're the one that gives your all
You're the one I always call
When I need you, make everything stop
Finally, you put my love on top
Baby, 'cause you're the one that I love
Baby, you're the one that I need
You're the only one I see
Baby, baby, it's you
You're the one that gives your all
You're the one that always calls
When I need you everything stops
Finally you put my love on top
Baby, 'cause you're the one that I love
Baby, you're the one that I need
You're the only one I see
Baby, baby, it's you
You're the one that gives your all
You're the one that always calls
When I need you everything stops
Finally you put my love on top

[Intro]
Woah-oah, hm-hmm

[Verse 1]
You've been runnin' 'round, runnin' 'round, runnin' 'round
Throwin' that dirt all on my name
'Cause you knew that I, knew that I, knew that I'd
Call you up
You've been going 'round, going 'round, going 'round
Every party in LA
'Cause you knew that I, knew that I, knew that I'd
Be at one, oh

[Pre-Chorus]
I know that dress is karma, perfume regret
You got me thinking 'bout when you were mine, ooh
And now I'm all up on ya, what you expect?
But you're not coming home with me tonight

[Chorus]
You just want attention, you don't want my heart
Maybe you just hate the thought of me with someone new
Yeah, you just want attention, I knew from the start
You're just making sure I'm never gettin' over you, oh

[Verse 2]
You've been runnin' 'round, runnin' 'round, runnin' 'round
Throwin' that dirt all on my name
'Cause you knew that I, knew that I, knew that I'd
Call you up
Baby, now that we're, now that we're, now that we're
Right here standin' face to face
You already know, 'ready know, 'ready know
That you won, oh

[Pre-Chorus]
I know that dress is karma , perfume regret, yeah
You got me thinking 'bout when you were mine, ooh

And now I'm all up on ya , what you expect? 
But you're not coming home with me tonight, oh no

[Chorus]
You just want attention, you don't want my heart
Maybe you just hate the thought of me with someone new 
Yeah, you just want attention , I knew from the start 
You're just making sure I'm never gettin' over you , oh

[Bridge]
What are you doin' to me?
What are you doin', huh? 
What are you doin' to me?
What are you doin', huh? 
What are you doin' to me?
What are you doin', huh? 
What are you doin' to me?

What are you doin', huh?

[Chorus: Charlie Puth]
We don't talk anymore, we don't talk anymore
We don't talk anymore, like we used to do
We don't love anymore
What was all of it for?
Oh, we don't talk anymore, like we used to do

[Verse 1: Charlie Puth]
I just heard you found the one you've been looking
You've been looking for
I wish I would have known that wasn't me
'Cause even after all this time I still wonder
Why I can't move on
Just the way you did so easily

[Pre-Chorus 1: Charlie Puth]
Don't wanna know
What kind of dress you're wearing tonight
If he's holdin' onto you so tight
The way I did before
I overdosed
Should've known your love was a game
Now I can't get you out of my brain
Oh, it's such a shame

[Chorus: Charlie Puth]
That we don't talk anymore, we don't talk anymore
We don't talk anymore, like we used to do
We don't love anymore
What was all of it for?
Oh, we don't talk anymore, like we used to do

[Verse 2: Selena Gomez]
I just hope you're lying next to somebody
Who knows how to love you like me
There must be a good reason that you're gone
Every now and then I think you
Might want me to come show up at your door
But I'm just too afraid that I'll be wrong

[Pre-Chorus 2: Selena Gomez]
Don't wanna know
If you're lookin' into her eyes
If she's holdin' onto you so tight
The way I did before
I overdosed
Should've known your love was a game
Now I can't get you out of my brain
Oh, it's such a shame

[Chorus: Charlie Puth & Selena Gomez]
That we don't talk anymore, we don't talk anymore
We don't talk anymore, like we used to do
We don't love anymore
What was all of it for?
Oh, we don't talk anymore, like we used to do
Like we used to do

[Pre-Chorus 2: Charlie Puth & Selena Gomez]
Don't wanna know
What kind of dress you're wearing tonight
If he's giving it to you just right
The way I did before
I overdosed
Should've known your love was a game
Now I can't get you out of my brain
Oh, it's such a shame

[Chorus: Charlie Puth & Selena Gomez]
That we don't talk anymore, we don't talk anymore
We don't talk anymore, like we used to do
We don't love anymore
What was all of it for?
Oh, we don't talk anymore, like we used to do

[Outro: Charlie Puth & Selena Gomez, Both]
We don't talk anymore, oh, oh


The way I did before
We don't talk anymore, oh, whoa


Oh, it's such a shame
That we don't talk anymore

[Intro]
Alright
Ooh, yeah

[Verse 1]
I'll admit, I was wrong, what else can I say, girl?
Can't you blame my head and not my heart?
I was drunk, I was gone, that don't make it right, but
Promise there were no feelings involved, mmh

[Pre-Chorus]
She said, "Boy, tell me honestly
Was it real or just for show?", yeah
She said, "Save your apologies
Baby, I just gotta know

[Chorus]
How long has this been goin' on?
You've been creepin' 'round on me
While you're callin' me "baby"
How long has this been goin' on?
You've been actin' so shady 
I've been feelin' it lately, baby"

[Post-Chorus]
Ooo-oh 
Ooo-oh 
Oooh-ooh-oh

[Verse 2]
I'll admit, it's my fault, but you gotta believe me
When I say it only happened once, mmm
I try, and I try, but you'll never see that
You're the only one I wanna love, oh, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
She said "Boy, tell me honestly"
"Was it real or just for show?", yeah
She said, "Save your apologies"
"Baby, I just gotta know

[Chorus]
How long has this been goin' on?
You've been creepin' 'round on me
While you're callin' me "baby"
How long has this been goin' on?
You've been actin' so shady
I've been feelin' it lately, baby"

[Post-Chorus]
Ooo-oh 
Ooo-oh 
Oooh-ooh-oh
How long has it been goin' on, baby?
Ooo-oh 
Ooo-oh, you gotta go tell me now
Oooh-ooh-oh

[Pre-Chorus]
She said, "Boy, tell me honestly
Was it real or just for show?", yeah
She said, "Save your apologies
Baby, I just gotta know

[Chorus]
How long has this been goin' on?
And you' been creepin' 'round on me
While you're callin' me "baby"
How long has this been goin' on?
You've been actin' so shady
I've been feelin' it lately, baby"

[Post-Chorus]

How long has this been goin' on?

You've been creepin' 'round on me

How long has it been goin' on, baby? Oh

How long has this been goin' on?



You've been actin' so shady
I've been feelin' it lately, baby

[Intro: Charlie Puth]
Let's Marvin Gaye and get it on
You got the healing that I want
Just like they say it in the song
Until the dawn, let's Marvin Gaye and get it on

[Verse 1: Charlie Puth]
We got this king-size to ourselves
Don't have to share with no one else
Don't keep your secrets to yourself
It's Kama Sutra show and tell, yeah

Just like they say it in the song
Until the dawn, let's Marvin Gaye and get it on

[Verse 2: Meghan Trainor]
And when you leave me all alone
I'm like a stray without a home
I'm like a dog without a bone
I just want you for my own
I got to have you, babe

[Pre-Chorus 2: Charlie Puth & Meghan Trainor]
Whoa-oh-oh-oh
There's lovin' in your eyes that pulls me closer

It's so subtle , I'm in trouble

[Chorus]
I'm only one call away
I'll be there to save the day
Superman got nothing on me
I'm only one call away

[Verse 1]
Call me, baby, if you need a friend
I just wanna give you love
C'mon, c'mon, c'mon
Reaching out to you, so take a chance

[Pre-Chorus]
No matter where you go
You know you're not alone

[Chorus]
I'm only one call away
I'll be there to save the day
Superman got nothing on me
I'm only one call away

[Verse 2]
Come along with me and don't be scared
I just wanna set you free
C'mon, c'mon, c'mon
You and me can make it anywhere
But for now, we could stay here for a while 
'Cause you know, I just wanna see you smile

[Pre-Chorus]
No matter where you go
You know you're not alone

[Chorus]
I'm only one call away
I'll be there to save the day
Superman got nothing on me
I'm only one call away

[Bridge]
And when you're weak, I'll be strong
I'm gonna keep holding on
Now don't you worry, it won't be long, darling
And when you feel like hope is gone
Just run into my arms

[Chorus]
I'm only one call away
I'll be there to save the day
Superman got nothing on me
I'm only one, I'm only one call away
I'll be there to save the day
Superman got nothing on me
I'm only one call away

[Outro]
I'm only one call away

[Intro: Charlie Puth]
Oh, oh

[Verse 1: Charlie Puth]
 What you thinking?
You think that you could be better off with somebody new

You say you're leaving
Well, if you wanna leave, there ain't nobody stopping you


[Pre-Chorus: Charlie Puth]
I won't beg for your love
Won't say, "Please"
I won't fall to the ground on my knees
You know I've given this everything
Baby, honestly, baby, honestly

[Chorus: Charlie Puth]
I lied for you, baby
I'd die for you, baby
I've cried for you, baby
But tell me what you've done for me
For you, baby, and only you, baby
The things I do, baby
But tell me what you've done for me

[Verse 2: Kehlani]
I never cheated
Deleted everyone 'cause they made you uncomfortable

These accusations
I can't apologize for something that I didn't do


[Pre-Chorus: Kehlani & Charlie Puth]
I won't beg for your love
Won't say, "Please" 
I won't fall to the ground on my knees 
You know I've given this everything 
Baby honestly, , baby honestly 

[Chorus: Charlie Puth]
I lied for you, baby
I'd die for you, baby
I've cried for you, baby
But tell me what you've done for me
For you, baby, and only you, baby
The things I do, baby
But tell me what you've done for me

[Post-Chorus: Charlie Puth]

Oh, tell me what you've done for me

Oh, tell me what you've done for me

Baby, honestly
Tell me what you've done for me

[Chorus: Charlie Puth & Kehlani]
I lied for you, baby
I'd die for you, baby
I've cried for you, baby
But tell me what you've done for me
For you, baby, and only you, baby 
The things I do, baby
 But tell me what you've done for me

[Outro: Charlie Puth]

Oh, tell me what you've done for me

Oh, tell me what you've done for me

[Verse 1]
Yeah, maybe I'ma get a little anxious
Maybe I'ma get a little shy
'Cause everybody's tryna be famous
And I'm just tryna find a place to hide 
All I wanna do is just hold somebody
But no one ever wants to get to know somebody
I don't even know how to explain this
I don't even think I'm gonna try

[Pre-Chorus]
And that's okay
I promise myself one day


[Chorus]
I'ma tell 'em all
I'ma tell 'em all that you could either hate me or love me
But that's just the way I am
I'ma tell 'em all
I'ma tell 'em all that you could either hate me or love me
But that's just the way I am

[Post-Chorus]
That's just the way I am
That's just the way I am
That's just the way I am
That's just the way I am

[Verse 2]
Maybe I'ma get a little nervous
Maybe I don't go out anymore 
Feelin' like I really don't deserve this 
Life ain't nothing like it was before 
'Cause all I wanna do is just hold somebody
But no one ever wants to get to know somebody
If you go and look under the surface 
Baby, I'm a little insecure

[Pre-Chorus]
And that's okay

I promise myself one day


[Chorus]
I'ma tell 'em all
I'ma tell 'em all that you could either hate me or love me
But that's just the way I am
I'ma tell 'em all
I'ma tell 'em all that you could either hate me or love me
But that's just the way I am

[Post-Chorus]
That's just the way I am
That's just the way I am
That's just the way I am
That's just the way I am

[Refrain]
I'ma tell 'em all 
I'ma tell 'em all that you could either hate me or love me

But that's just the way I am

[Bridge]
Am, am
Yeah, this is what you wanted
Oh, this is what you wanted
I am, am, am
Yeah, this is what you wanted
Oh, this is what you wanted all along

[Breakdown]
Everybody's tryna be famous
And I'm just tryna find a place to hide

[Chorus]
I'ma tell 'em all
I'ma tell 'em all that you could either hate me or love me
But that's just the way I am
I'ma tell 'em all
I'ma tell 'em all that you could either hate me or love me
But that's just the way I am

[Post-Chorus]
That's just the way I am
That's just the way I am

That's just the way I am
That's just the way I am


[Refrain]
I'ma tell 'em all

I'ma tell 'em all that you could either hate me or love me

But that's just the way I am

[Verse 1: Charlie Puth]
No, this is not goodbye
I swear that I'm gonna change
No, baby, please don't cry
It doesn't have to end this way

[Pre-Chorus: Charlie Puth]
'Cause when I think of all the nights I'll be alone
I get terrified
Please don't say goodbye

[Chorus: Charlie Puth]
'Cause girl, if you leave me now
If you're givin' up and just walk right out
You will take the biggest part of me
And all the things that I believe
Baby, if you leave me now 

[Verse 2: Wanya Morris]
When did we lose our way?
My whole world was unravellin'
And girl, it's drivin' me insane
There's no road worth travellin'

[Pre-Chorus: Charlie Puth & Boyz II Men]
When I think about all of the nights you're gone 
I get terrified 
Please don't say goodbye 

[Chorus: Wanya Morris with Charlie Puth]
'Cause girl, if you leave me now
If you're givin' up and just walk right out 
You will take the biggest part of me
And all the things that I believe
Baby, if you leave me now
Oh, baby, if you leave me now

[Bridge: Charlie Puth]
Oh, I can promise if we parted, parted
And if you left me brokenhearted
Every single night, I'll think about you with someone else
Baby, if you leave me

[Chorus: Charlie Puth & Wanya Morris]
Baby, if you leave me now 
Oh, if you're givin' up and just walk right out 
You will take the biggest part of me
And all the things that I believe
Baby if you leave me now

[Chorus: Charlie Puth & Wanya Morris]
Oh girl, if you leave me now
If you're givin' up and just walk right out 
You will take the biggest part of me
And all the things that I believe
Baby, if you leave me now
Oh, baby, if you leave me now

[Verse 1]
This is gonna hurt, but I blame myself first
'Cause I ignored the truth
Drunk off of that love, it fucked my head up
Theres no forgetting you

[Pre-Chorus]
Youve awoken me, but youre choking me
I was so obsessed
Gave you all of me
And now honestly, I got nothing left

[Chorus]
I loved you dangerously
More than the air that I breathe
Knew we would crash at the speed that we were going
Didnt care if the explosion ruined me
Baby, I loved you dangerously
Mmm, mmm
I loved you dangerously

[Verse 2]
Usually I hold the power with both my hands tied behind my back
Look at how things changed
'Cause now youre the train and Im tied to the track

[Pre-Chorus]
Youve awoken me, but youre choking me
I was so obsessed
Gave you all of me
And now honestly, I got nothing left

[Chorus]
'Cause I loved you dangerously
More than the air that I breathe
Knew we would crash at the speed that we were going
Didnt care if the explosion ruined me
Baby, I loved you dangerously

[Bridge]
You took me down, down, down, down
And kissed my lips with goodbye
I see it now, now, now, now
It was a matter of time
You know I know, theres only one place this could lead
But you are the fire, Im gasoline

[Breakdown]
I love you, I love you, I love you

[Chorus]
I loved you dangerously
Ooh, more than the air that I breathe
Oh now, knew we would crash at the speed that we were going
Didnt care if the explosion ruined me
Oh, oh baby, I loved you dangerously

[Outro]
Mmmm, mmmm
Ooh, I loved you dangerously
Ooh-ooh, I loved you dangerously

[Verse 1]
It started with a kiss
On your mama's couch
2012 was nothing serious
And then we caught thefeels
Itgot really real
Toogood to be true
I guess Ithought you was, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
Why did I run away, run away, run away?
Oh, your love was everything, everything, everything
I know it's gettin' late, gettin' late, gettin' late
But can I still be on my way, on my way? Yeah

[Chorus]
I know I said goodbye and, baby, you said it too
But when I touch her, I feel like I'm cheating on you
I thought that I'd be better when I found someone new
But when I touch her, I feel like I'm cheating on you

[Post-Chorus]
Baby, no, oh, cheating on you
Baby, no
But when I touch her, I feel like I'm cheating on you

[Verse 2]
Thought I could get you back any time of day
Shouldn't have been so cocky
Shouldn't have did you wrong 
And now I miss you bad, really, really bad
Guess you don't know what you got until it's gone

[Pre-Chorus]
Why did I run away, run away, run away? 
Oh, your love was everything, everything, everything 
I know it's gettin' late, gettin' late, gettin' late 
But can I still be on my way, on my way? Yeah

[Chorus]
I know I said goodbye and, baby, you said it too

But when I touch her, I feel like I'm cheating on you

I thought that I'd be better when I found someone new 
But when I touch her, I feel like I'm cheating on you

[Post-Chorus]
Baby, no, oh, cheating on you
Baby, no
But when I touch her, I feel like I'm cheating on you

[Bridge]
Baby, no
There ain't no lips like your lips
And nobody else feels like this
There's no moving on, I'll admit
If you go away, yeah

[Chorus]
I know I said goodbye and, baby, you said it too
But when I touch her, I feel like I'm cheating on you

I thought that I'd be better when I found someone new

But when I touch her, I feel like I'm cheating on you


[Post-Chorus]
Baby, no, oh, cheating on you 
Baby, no 
But when I touch her, I feel like I'm cheating on you

[Outro]
I said goodbye
And you said goodbye

[Intro]
Sorry

[Verse 1]
These mistakes, Ive made my fair share
When you needed me, I wasnt there
I was young, I was dumb, I was so immature
And the things that I did made you so insecure
But baby, Im still your man, I swear

[Chorus]
Please be patient with me
Please be patient with me
I know Im not what you need
But baby, Im gonna be
So please be patient with me

[Verse 2]
Is it too much  that Im asking for?
Can we start over?  Can we end this war?
Ive been taking your love, Ive been wasting your time
But is there still a chance of me changing your mind?
Before you  go walking out the door

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, you know Im not perfect
If you leave, I deserve it
But baby, all Im asking you is please, please 

[Chorus]
Please be patient with me 
Please be patient with me 
I know Im not what you need 
But baby, Im gonna be 
So please be patient with me 

[Bridge]
Oh, you dont wanna wait another minute
You dont wanna wait another night
Just trust me, just trust me, just trust me, baby
You dont wanna wait another minute, no
You dont wanna wait another night
Just trust me, just trust me, just trust me, baby

[Chorus]
Please be patient with me
Please be patient with me
I know Im not what you need
But baby, Im gonna be
So please be patient with me
Please be patient with me 
Please be patient with me, yeah

[Chorus]
I warned myself that I shouldn't play with fire
But I can tell that I'll doitone more time
Don'ttrust in myself,  no goodfor my health 
You messed with my heart, now you're the reason why

[Verse 1]
Do you remember when you told me I don't have to worry?
"He's overseas, out on his tour, he'll be okay without me"
You said you had nothing to hide, that you left him long ago
I shoulda known that was a lie

[Chorus]
I warned myself that I shouldn't play with fire
But I can tell that I'll do it one more time
Don't trust in myself,  no good for my health 
You messed with my heart, now you're the reason why
I warned myself that I shouldn't play with fire
But I can tell that I'll do it one more time
Don't trust in myself,  no good for my health 
You messed with my heart, now you're the reason why

[Verse 2]
Do you remember when you said, "Do not tell anybody
'Cause if ya do, I'll be the first to put my hands around your throat"?
If you had nothing to hide, why is no one s'posed to know?
I shoulda known that was a lie

[Chorus]
I  warned myself  that I shouldn't play with fire 
But I can tell  that I'll do it one more time
Don't trust in myself,  no good for my health 
You messed with my heart, now you're the reason why
I warned myself  that I shouldn't play with fire
But I can tell  that I'll do it one more time
Don't trust in myself,  no good for my health 
You messed with my heart, now you're the reason why

[Outro]
The reason why

[Chorus]
It's been a long day without you, my friend
And I'll tell you all about it when I see you again
We've come a long way from where we began
Oh, I'll tell you all about it when I see you again
When I see you again

[Verse 1]
Why'd you have to leave so soon, yeah?
Why'd you have to go?
Why'd you have to leave me when I needed you the most?
'Cause I don't know really how to tell you without feeling much worse
I know you're in a better place but it's always gonna hurt

[Pre-Chorus]
Carry on
Give me all the strength I need
To carry on

[Chorus]
It's been a long day without you, my friend
And I'll tell you all about it when I see you again
We've come a long way from where we began
Oh, I'll tell you all about it when I see you again
When I see you again

[Verse 2]
How do I breathe without you? I'm feeling so cold
I'll be waitin' right here for you 'till the day you're home

[Pre-Chorus]
Carry on
Give me all the strength I need
To carry on

[Bridge]
So let the light guide your way, yeah
Hold every memory as you go
And every road you take
Will always lead you home, home

[Chorus]
It's been a long day without you, my friend
And I'll tell you all about it when I see you again
We've come a long way from where we began
Oh, I'll tell you all about it when I see you again
When I see you again

When I see you again
When I see you again
See you again
When I see you again

[Verse 1]
I got these girls tryna lock me down
And I always up and leave
But for the first time in a while
I wanna throw away the key
And I know you've been in a couple more relationships than me
'Cause you talk a different talk
And you kiss me differently

[Pre-Chorus]
Now I don't know where to go
After you loved me this way
After you love me so good
How are you gonna tell me you don't wanna stay?

[Chorus]
You tell me I'm too young, but
I gave you what you wanted
Baby, how dare you treat me just like
Like a boy
You won't wake up beside me
'Cause I was born in the '90s
Baby, how dare you treat me just like
Like a boy 
Boy 
Boy

[Verse 2]
You told me you needed a perfect guy
That'll make your parents proud
Guess you still ain't found him yet 
'Cause we're still messin' around 
And now you watch me put in all this work
Just to say it won't work out 
You never took me seriously 
Now, what the hell is that about?

[Pre-Chorus]
Now I don't where to go 
After you loved me this way 
After you loved me so good
How are you gonna tell me you don't wanna stay?

[Chorus]
You tell me I'm too young, but 
I gave you what you wanted 
Baby, how dare you treat me just like
Like a boy
You won't wake up beside me 
'Cause I was born in the '90s 
Baby, how dare you treat me just like 
Like a boy 
Boy 
Boy
Baby, don't you treat me like a boy
Boy 
Boy 
Boy

[Instrumental Bridge]

[Chorus]
You tell me I'm too young, but 
I gave you what you wanted 
Baby, how dare you treat me just like
Like a boy
You won't wake up beside me 
'Cause I was born in the '90s 
Baby, how dare you treat me just like
Like a boy 
Boy 
Boy
Baby, don't you treat me like a boy
Boy 
Boy 
Boy

[Outro]
Just like, like a boy
Just like, like a boy

[Intro: Charlie Puth]
One, two, three, four
Why are we looking down
On our sisters and brothers?
Isn't love, all that we got?
Don't we know everyone's
Got a father and mother?
The day we know we're all the same
Together we can make that change

[Verse 1: James Taylor, Both]
Look around, there are too many of us crying
And not enough love to go around
What a waste, another day
Another good one dying
But I know that the world will change
The day we know we're all the same

[Chorus: Charlie Puth]
Why cant we just get along?
If loving one another's wrong
Then how are we supposed to
Get close to each other?
We gotta make that change, yeah
Why cant we just get along?

[Verse 2: James Taylor, Charlie Puth, Both]
What a waste it would be to deny somebody
Of a chance to be theirselves
What a waste it would be if we hurt for nothing?
But I know that the world can change
The day we know we're all the same

[Chorus: Charlie Puth]
Why cant we just get along?
If loving one another's wrong
Then how are we supposed to
Get close to each other?
We gotta make that change, yeah

[Bridge: Charlie Puth]
I know we could break apart
We dont have to go that way
Not today

[Chorus: Charlie Puth]
Why cant we just get along?
If loving one another's wrong
Then how are we supposed to
Get close to yeah
Why cant we just get along?
If loving one another's wrong
Then how are we supposed to
Get close to each other?
We gotta make that change, yeah

[Outro: Charlie Puth]
That change, yeah

[Verse 1]
He's such a nice boy, so well-mannered
He's so much better than the last one youbroughtaround
Please and thankyou, everything matters
I'm gonna make surethat she knows I'm the best she's found

[Pre-Chorus]
The moment she walks out that door
I'm not pretending anymore

[Chorus]
If your mother knew all of the things that we do
If your mother knew all the things we do
If your mother knew, she'd keep me so far from you
If your mother knew all the things we do

[Verse 2]
Sneak out the window, bed stuffed with pillows
I'll be waiting in the car right around the block
Back of the Benzo 
More than a friend zone 
We've been hiding since the time they forgot to knock

[Pre-Chorus]
The moment she walks out that door 
I'm not pretending anymore

[Chorus]
If your mother knew all of the things that we do 
If your mother knew 
All the things we do 
If your mother knew, she'd keep me so far from you
If your mother knew  all the things we do

[Bridge]
Next time that she sees me
She gon' act like she don't know me
'Cause she knows all of the story
Now your daddy wants to kill me 
Next time that she sees me
She gon' act like she don't know me
'Cause she knows all of the story
Now your daddy wants to kill me 
If your mother only knew 

[Pre-Chorus]
The moment she walks out that door
I'm not pretending anymore

[Chorus]
If your mother knew all of the things that we do
If your mother knew all the things we do 
If your mother knew, she'd keep me so far from you
If your mother knew all the things we do 

[Post-Chorus]
Next time that she sees me 
She gon' act like she don't know me 
'Cause she knows all of the story
Now your daddy wants to kill me 
Next time that she sees me
She gon' act like she don't know me
'Cause she knows all of the story
Now your daddy wants to kill me 

[Outro]
If your mother knew all the things we do
If your mother knew all the things we do
If your mother knew all of the things that we do

[Verse 1]
Told you I'm moving on to bigger and better things
Guess you never know what good you got until it's gone
Thought I could find somebody new who could take your place
The list goes on, and on, and on

[Pre-Chorus]
There was Nikki, Nicole, Tiffany, and Heather
But there's only room for you in my world
But she said that I change like the East Coast weather
How the hell did I get caught up messin' with these LA girls?

[Chorus]
I miss my baby
I'm missin' my baby 
I miss my baby
Messin' with these LA girls


[Verse 2]
I miss the days we take the Greyhound to NYC 
Wish I could've seen that it was perfect how it was
Listen, I don't want this to be the way you remember me
'Cause I know I was wrong, wrong

[Pre-Chorus]
There was Nikki, Nicole, Tiffany, and Heather
But there's only room for you in my world 
But she said that I change like the East Coast weather 
How the hell did I get caught up 
Messin' with these LA girls?

[Chorus]
I miss my baby 
I'm missin' my baby 
I miss my baby
Here we go messin' with these LA girls
I miss my baby 
I'm missin' my baby 
I miss my baby
Here we go messin' with these LA girls

[Bridge]
One, two, three
Talk to me like - ah ooh
Ooh, yeah, ooh , ooh-ooh
Quit messin' with me, baby
Ah Ooh, ooh, yeah, ooh, , ooh ooh

[Pre-Chorus]
There was Nikki, Nicole, Tiffany, and Heather
But there's only room for you in my world 
But you say that I change like the East Coast weather
How the hell did I get caught up
Messin' with these LA girls?

[Chorus]
I miss my baby 
I'm missin' my baby 
I miss my baby 
Messin' with these LA girls 
I miss my baby
I'm missin' my baby 
I miss my baby 
Messin' with these LA girls
I miss my baby
I'm missin' my baby 
I miss my baby
All of these LA girls
I miss my baby 
I'm missin' my baby 
I miss my baby
Messin' with these LA girls

[Chorus]
Don't run from me, river
Don't run from me river, river
No, don't run from me, river
Don't run from me river, river

[Verse 1]
Look, you can play it cool
Act like you don't care
River, don't be cruel
You're pushin' me away
Don't want to get hurt
So you hurt me first
With the words you say

[Pre-Chorus]
Maybe you should fall
That's what rivers do
'Cause when you're in love
You don't mind a different view
Things are lookin' up

[Chorus]
Oh river 
Don't run 
Don't run 
Don't run 
Oh river 
Don't run 
Don't run 
From our love 

[Verse 2]
Look, darlin', don't give up
When the water's rough
Where you gonna go?
My heart is your home
Nothin' is as cold
As runnin' on your own
So river, don't you rush

[Pre-Chorus]
Maybe you should fall
That's what rivers do
'Cause when you're in love
You don't mind a different view
Things are lookin' up

[Chorus]
Oh river 
Don't run 
Don't run 
Don't run 
Oh river 
Don't run 
Don't run 
From our love 

[Bridge]
Don't run from me, river
Don't run from me river, river
No don't run from me, river
Don't run from me river, river
No don't run from me, river
Don't run from me river, river
No don't run from me, river

[Pre-Chorus]
Maybe you should fall
That's what rivers do
'Cause when you're in love
You don't mind a different view
Things are lookin' up

[Chorus]
Oh river 
Don't run 
Don't run 
Don't run 
Oh river 
Don't run 
Don't run 
From our love 

[Outro]
Oh river  
Don't run  
Don't run  
Don't run  
Oh river  
Don't run  
Don't run  
From our love  
No

[Verse 1]
Detonate, detonator
Baby, oh, you blow my mind
You tell me wait, wait on ya
But baby, I can't wait all night
I go through pictures you send my phone
Oh, stop tempting me
You know what I want
I wanna make, wanna make love
Girl, I can't lie

[Chorus]
I'm just a sucker for a cold-hearted lover
You make me suffer, you make me suffer
Don't keep me waiting
You should come over, whoa
Don't make me suffer, don't make me suffer

[Verse 2]
So, here we go, go again
It's like I'm caught under your spell
You're wearing black, black magic
Well, baby, don't wear nothing else
When I open up this door, don't you play
Ain't no other man gon' make you feel the same
I wanna make, wanna make love
Girl, I can't lie

[Chorus]
I'm just a sucker for a cold-hearted lover
You make me suffer, you make me suffer
Don't keep me waiting 
You should come over 
Don't make me suffer, don't make me suffer

[Bridge]
I hate it when you get your way
But we love, yeah, we love it, baby
Some things don't ever change
You make me suffer, baby, oh
You, you, oh-oh-oh

[Chorus]
I'm just a sucker 
For a cold-hearted lover 
You make me suffer , you make me suffer

Don't keep me waiting 
You should come over, whoa
Don't make me suffer, don't make me suffer

[Verse 1]
I got a situation, this girl been stressin' me
Sayin' she better be the only one
My life is complicated, she's only 23
I'm not the guy that she's supposed to love

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, the more that I tell her I'm not stayin' over
The harder she makes it to go
Oh, the more that I try to convince her this won't work
The faster she takes off her clothes

[Chorus]
Girl, you gotta slow it down 
I'm not tryna fall for you
Girl, you gotta slow it down 
I can't give it all to you
Even though I want to

[Verse 2]
She knows just what she doin', she fuckin' with my head
Wrappin' her legs so tight around my waist
Two in the afternoon, but, we still ain't out of bed
No matter what, she always gets her way

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, the more that I tell her I'm not stayin' over 
The harder she makes it to go 
Oh, the more that I try to convince her this won't work 
The faster she takes off her clothes

[Chorus]
Girl, you gotta slow it down 
I'm not tryna fall for you
Girl, you gotta slow it down 
I can't give it all to you
Even though I want to
Even though I want to, oh, yeah

[Bridge]
You've got to slow it, slow it down, baby
You've got to slow it down
You don't know what you're doin' to me now
You've got to slow it, slow it down, baby
Oh
You've got to slow it down
Oh

[Chorus]
Girl, you gotta slow it down 
I'm not tryna fall for you 
Girl, you gotta slow it down 
I can't give it all to you
Even though I want to
Oh, you gotta slow it down, yeah, yeah

[Verse 1]
I was just with you on your birthday
And I met your whole family
But on the way home
You kept looking at your phone
Couldn't help but ask, "Who is that, babe?"
And the way you said, "Nobody"
I knew the rumors
They were more than just rumors

[Pre-Chorus]
Maybe I should have noticed
You were just half in love
Maybe I should have noticed
That I'm not the only one

[Chorus]
Somebody told me that you
Got another lover you've been giving it to
Can't believe I believed you
You were my girl
Somebody saw you with him
Now you're tryna tell me that he's only a friend
Can't believe I believed it
You were my girl



[Verse 2]
Lately you've been making excuses
And the stories ain't adding up
But I just go blind, when you look into my eyes
Every time that I try to confront you 
There's always somewhere you gotta run to 
The warning signs
They were more than just warning signs

[Pre-Chorus]
Maybe I should have noticed
You were just half in love 
Maybe I should have noticed
That I'm not the only one

[Chorus]
'Cause somebody told me that you
Got another lover you've been giving it to
Can't believe I believed you
You were my girl
Somebody saw you with him
Now you're tryna tell me that he's only a friend
Can't believe I believed that
You were my girl


You were my girl
Maybe I should have noticed
You were just half in love 
Maybe I should have noticed
That I'm not the only one 

[Bridge]
Yeah
Maybe I should have noticed
That I'm not the only one

[Chorus]
Somebody told me that you
Got another lover you've been giving it to
Can't believe I believed you 
You were my girl
Somebody saw you with him
Now you're tryna tell me that he's only a friend
Can't believe I believed that 
You were my girl
That you were mine
Hey, you were my girl
Maybe I should have noticed
You were just half in love 
Maybe I should have noticed
That I'm not the only one
You were my girl

[Verse 1]
Oh, the way that you dance on me makes me not wanna leave
You wanna go upstairs but you don't wanna sleep
Oh, right now we're in a rhythm
Your boyfriend's no competition
Turn off your phone and blame it on your battery 

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh-oh-oh-oh
We're getting real, real close
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Can't let this moment go

[Chorus]
Hands on your body like there's no one at the party
Just me and you and these empty cups
If you wanna like I wanna
Let me take you to another room
So it's only us
Turn that television up so nobody can listen
Hands on your body like there's no one at the party
Just me and you and these empty cups

[Verse 2]
Oh, girl, do you think they'll notice if we slip away?
Maybe tomorrow they'll all have something to say
Oh, right now we're in the rhythm
We don't need no one's permission
End of the night don't mean we gotta separate 

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh-oh-oh-oh
We're getting real, real close
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Can't let this moment go

[Chorus]
Hands on your body like there's no one at the party
Just me and you  and these empty cups
If you wanna like I wanna
Let me take you to another room 
So it's only us
Turn that television up so nobody can listen
Hands on your body like there's no one at the party
Just me and you  and these empty cups
All of these empty cups
Baby, all of these empty cups

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh-oh-oh-oh
We're getting real, real close
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Can't let this moment go

[Chorus]
Hands on your body like there's no one at the party
Just me and you  and these empty cups
If you wanna like I wanna
Let me take you to another room 
So it's only us
Turn that television up so nobody can listen
Hands on your body like there's no one at the party
Just me and you  and these empty cups

All of these empty cups

Like it's only us
Turn that television up so nobody can listen
Hands on your body like there's no one at the party
Just me and you and these empty cups

[Verse 1]
You could say I lived a crazy life for a man so young
The kind that made me question my faith
Now I'm looking back just wondering where the time has gone
But I guess it's just the price you pay
I've already loved more than I thought I could love someone
I've already felt my heart break 
I've already fell so many times, but I got back up
But at least I did it all my way

[Chorus]
I've been through it all
Yeah, I've been through it all
Yeah, you won't see me crying if tomorrow never comes
God only knows, I've been through it all

[Verse 2]
Growing up in this wild city, you had to fight or run
Now you know why I'm not afraid, yeah
Maybe it's my recklessness that got me in trouble
But at least I did it all my way

[Chorus]
I've been through it all
Yeah, I've been through it all
Yeah, you won't see me crying if tomorrow never comes
God only knows, I've been through it all

[Bridge]
Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
Yeah, I've been through it all
Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
Yeah, yeah, oh, mmh-mmh, mmh-mmh

[Chorus]
I've been through it all
Yeah, I've been through it all
Yeah, you won't see me crying if tomorrow never comes
God only knows, I've been through it all
You won't see me crying if tomorrow never comes
God only knows, I've been through it all

[Verse 1]
I should have told you how I really feel
A little in advance
Then I wouldve had some time to go and work it out
I think Ive lost my chance

[Pre-Chorus]
For the last three years I just hid it so well
Hoping that youd figure it out because I never could tell it
Straight to your face

Never have I ever woken up in a cold hard sweat
From a dream wondering
If youd ever say "goodbye"
If I didnt say it first

[Chorus]
Im done playing these games
I cant believe what Im about to say
I wont tell you goodbye with my love left behind
Kiss me before I fucking lose my mind

[Verse 2]
No, no more nights
Drink until my loneliness
Up till two A.M

No, no more waiting
Pacing 'round the bar
Hoping that you might walk in

[Pre-Chorus]
For the last three years I just hid it so well
Hoping that youd figure it out because I never could tell it
Straight to your face

Never have I ever woken up in a cold hard sweat
From a dream wondering
If youd ever say "goodbye"
If I didnt say it first

[Chorus]
Im done playing these games
I cant believe what Im about to say
No, I wont tell you goodbye with my love left behind
Kiss me before I fucking lose my mind

[Bridge]
Ooooh
Oooh
Oooh
Oooooh
Oooh
Oooh
Oooh

[Outro]
Im done playing these games
I cant believe what Im about to say
'Cause I would rather die than feeling this inside
Tricks played on my mind
No, I would rather die than just tell you goodbye
With my love left behind
Kiss me before I fucking lose my mind

[Verse 1]
When I'm old and grown
I won't sleep alone 
Every single moment will be faded into you
That's some type of love
That's some type of love
And I won't sing the blues
'Cause all I need is you 
Every single question will be answered all by you
That's some type of love
That's some type of love

[Chorus]
When the world's on fire
We won't even move
There is no reason if I'm here with you
And when it's said and done
I'll give me to you
That's some type of love
That's some type of love

[Verse 2]
When we're old and gray 
And our faces changed 
There won't be a moment when my heart don't feel the same
That's some type of love
That's some type of love 
And every story ends
But we could still pretend 
Every single moment will be just as we had planned
It was some type of love
That's some type of love

[Chorus]
When the world's on fire
We won't even move
There is no reason if I'm here with you
And when it's said and done
I'll give me to you
That's some type of love
That's some type of love

[Bridge]
I'll be with you
Give me to you, baby
That's some type of love
That's some type of love

[Chorus]
When the world's on fire
We won't even move
There is no reason if I'm here with you
And when it's said and done
I'll give me to you
That's some type of love
That's some type of love

[Verse 1]
Tell me lies, like how you're better off without me
While the truth is written all over your face
Even in photographs together, you look lonely, lonely
When you were here, you never had to fake

[Pre-Chorus]
And girl, I promise I'm not gonna bother you anymore
Soon as you hang up the phone
I just got one question that you might not be ready for
But I really gotta know

[Chorus]
Does it feel, feel like you never gon' find nothing better?
Does it feel, feel like you're missing, 'cause I loved you different?

[Verse 2]
And the way that you can say you don't remember
How I kept you coming over every night
And the way that you can say you never wondered, wondered
If loving someone else is just a lie

[Pre-Chorus]
Whoa, girl, I promise I'm not gonna bother you anymore
Soon as you hang up the phone
I just got one question that you might not be ready for
But I really gotta know

[Chorus]
Does it feel, feel like you never gon' find nothing better?
Does it feel, feel like you're missing, 'cause I loved you different?
Does it feel, feel like you never gon' find nothing better?
Does it feel, feel like you're missing, 'cause I loved you different?

[Bridge]
Girl, I promise I'm not gonna bother you anymore
Soon as you hang up the phone
I just got one question that you might not be ready for
But I really gotta know

[Chorus]
Does it feel, feel like you never gon' find nothing better?
Does it feel, feel like you're missing, 'cause I loved you different?
Does it feel, feel like you never gon' find nothing better?
Does it feel, feel like you're missing, 'cause I loved you different?

'Cause my heart can't take it anymore
And if you're creeping please don't let it show

[Verse 1: Charlie Puth]
Thinkin' back in time when I had you to lose
Those were the days, baby, you were the truth
And nothing you could do will ever change that
You riding with me, me riding for you
We followed our hearts, girl, forget what they do
But somewhere down the line, I left you hanging

[Pre-Chorus: Charlie Puth]
For you, I could climb
Mount Kilimanjaro a thousand times
Oh my friend
Ill never break your heart again

[Chorus: Charlie Puth]
'Cause I, I will always love you
Baby, I could never judge you
I would take you as you are, are, are, are, are
I, I will always love you
Baby, I could never judge you
I'll take you as you are, are, are, are, are

[Verse 2: Charlie Puth]
You know me like inside and out, how I feel
Nothing, more nothing less, youre the real

For you, I could climb
Mount Kilimanjaro a thousand times
Oh my friend
Ill never break your heart again

[Chorus: Charlie Puth]

I would take you as you are, are, are, are, are
I, I will always love you

[Verse 3: Shy Carter & Charlie Puth]
So let it be known now
The queen on my throne now
Its you at all times
Ill never reject you
Ill love and respect you
'Cause youre my lifeline
Only thing on my wish list
You love and forgiveness
For that, I will climb
Mount Kilimanjaro a thousand times
Why would I fight it?
I know that its right when youre holding my hand
I knew when I saw you
That God was just giving me a second chance
Ill climb every mountain
And scream at the top of my lungs that Im yours
You know that Im yours

[Chorus: Charlie Puth]
'Cause I, I will always love you 
Baby, I could never judge you 
I would take you as you are, are, are, are, are
I, I will always love you 

Baby, I could never judge you
I'll take you as you are, are, are, are, are

[Verse 1]
Well, I get a thrill from down my spine
When I see you hittin' me up
Feelin' so electrified
Like the heat of a million suns
You know just one touch can keep me high
And I think I'll never come down
'Til a couple days go by
And you're nowhere to be found

[Chorus]
Up all night
Up all night
All the things that you said to me yesterday
Playin' over in my mind
It's a crime
It's a crime
How you're reelin' me in with the games you play
Then you hang me out to dry

[Verse 2]
So I tried to shake you out my head
Tried to dance with somebody new
But you got those lips so red
And that smokey voice you do
So I know it's pointless anyway
'Cause there ain't nobody else
That could light me up so bright
And break this crazy spell

[Chorus]
Up all night
Up all night
All the things that you said to me yesterday
Playin' over in my mind
It's a crime
It's a crime
How you're reelin' me in with the games you play
Then you hang me out to dry

[Bridge]
If I wait a little longer
Then maybe you'll come back around
Wait a little longer
Then maybe you'll be ready now
'Cause I would wait forever
For you to fall back into my arms
So come on

[Chorus]
Up all night
Up all night
All the things that you said to me yesterday
Playin' over in my mind
It's a crime
It's a crime
How you're reelin' me in with the games you play
Then you hang me out to dry
Up all night
Up all night
All the things that you said to me yesterday
Playin' over in my mind
It's a crime
It's a crime
How you're reelin' me in with the games you play
Then you hang me out to dry
How you're reelin' me in with the games you play
Then you hang me out to dry

[Intro]
Ohh, ooh

[Verse 1]
Some girls walk in the room and everything remains
But when you opened up the door, my life completely changed
Some girls be cravin' that attention to be seen
But the one I'm lookin' at is right in front of me

[Pre-Chorus]
There's no words to express
When you're wearin' that dress that way
Oh-oh, oh-oh
There's no words to describe
Let me look in your eyes and say
Oh-oh

[Chorus]
There's beautiful, and then there's you
There's beautiful, and then there's you
There's beautiful, and then there's you

[Verse 2]
Some girls, they hit me up, sayin', "What you doin' now?"
But they don't really understand the masterpiece I've found
Those girls be wonderin' why I haven't been around
And if they haven't figured out, I bet they hear me now

[Pre-Chorus]
There's no words to express
When you're wearin' that dress that way
Oh-oh, oh-oh
There's no words to describe
Let me look in your eyes and say
Oh-oh

There's beautiful, and then there's you
There's beautiful, and then there's you
There's beautiful, and then there's you

But when you opened up the door, my life completely changed

[Chorus]
There's beautiful, and then there's you, oh

There's beautiful, and then there's you
I know there is beautiful, and then there's you
I know there is beautiful, and then there's you
There's beautiful, and then there's you
I know there is beautiful, and then there's you
I know there is beautiful, and then there's you

[Outro]
There's beautiful, and then there's you

[Verse 1]
Oh, darling, I know you're taken
Something 'bout this just don't feel right
Every time one of us tries to leave here
Oh, the other one holds on tight, oh, oh
Baby, tonight, there's so much
Love in between us but you say
You gotta get home
Stay here with me
I won't tell a soul

[Verse 2]
You tell me someone's waiting for ya
That you can't do this anymore
But you kiss me again
So go ahead and draw the blinds and lock all the doors
Baby, tonight, there's so much
Love in between us you say
That you gotta get home
Stay here with me
I won't tell a soul

[Bridge]
Oh, if you want me like I want you
I won't judge you, this could be our little secret 
Our secret 
So tell me if you're ready
Cause if no one knows then it ain't really cheating

[Verse 3]
Oh, darling, I know you're taken
Something 'bout this just feels so right
Cause every time one of us
Tries to justify the situation, we just hold on tighter, oh, oh
Baby, tonight, there's so much
Love in between us you say
That you gotta get home
Stay here with me
I won't tell a soul

[Verse 1]
Oh, I've been hurtin' lately
Im down on all my luck
Sometimes theres no one there by your side
I dont deserve this, baby
But I know I cant give up
Tough times, I just take them in stride

[Chorus]
Mmm, Im almost there, only one more step
Whoa, left, right, left, right, left
Mmm, Im movin' on, I got no regrets
Whoa, left, right, left, right, left

[Verse 2]
I said times are changin'
Tell me, how can I keep up?
Every time I turn around, theres a wall
But Im climbing daily, until I see the top
And I get up right after every fall
When youre brokenhearted and youre love's departed
Yeah, you gotta walk alone, yeah, its true
Flash every smile 'cause Ive been lost for miles
'Cause yeah, I know youve felt this way before too

[Chorus]
Mmm, were almost there, baby, one more step
Whoa, left, right, left, right, left
Mmm, were movin' on, we got no regrets
Whoa, left, right, left, right, left
Whoa, left, right, left, right, left
Whoa, left, right, left, right, left
Whoa, were almost, there only one more step
Whoa, left, right, left, right, left

[Bridge]
Mmm, I know it looks like its too far
But its nothing compared to how far weve come
Walking down this boulevard
When the darkest times come right before the sun

[Chorus]
Were almost there, baby, one more step
Whoa, left, right, left, right, left
Were movin' forward and theres no regrets
Whoa, left, right, left, right
Whoa, left, right, left, right, left
Whoa, left, right, left, right, left
Woah, were almost there, only one more step
Whoa, left, right, left, right, left
Whoa, left, right, left, right, left

Whoa, were almost there, only one more step
Whoa, left, right, left, right, left

What are you doin' huh? 
What are you doin' to me?
What are you doin', huh?

[Verse 1]
You must think that I'm stupid
You must think that I'm a fool
You must think that I'm new to this
But I have seen this all before

[Refrain]
I'm never gonna let you close to me
Even though you mean the most to me
'Cause every time I open up, it hurts
So I'm never gonna get too close to you
Even when I mean the most to you
In case you go and leave me in the dirt

[Pre-Chorus]
But every time you hurt me, the less that I cry
And every time you leave me, the quicker these tears dry
And every time you walk out, the less I love you
Baby, we don't stand a chance, it's sad but it's true

[Chorus]
I'm way too good at goodbyes

I'm way too good at goodbyes


[Verse 2]
I know you're thinkin' I'm heartless
I know you're thinkin' I'm cold
I'm just protectin' my innocence
I'm just protectin' my soul

[Refrain]
I'm never gonna let you close to me
Even though you mean the most to me
'Cause every time I open up, it hurts
So I'm never gonna get too close to you
Even when I mean the most to you
In case you go and leave me in the dirt

[Pre-Chorus]
But every time you hurt me, the less that I cry
And every time you leave me, the quicker these tears dry
And every time you walk out, the less l love you
Baby, we don't stand a chance, it's sad but it's true

[Chorus]
I'm way too good at goodbyes

I'm way too good at goodbyes

No way that you'll see me cry

I'm way too good at goodbyes


[Bridge]
No
No, no, no, no, no

No, no, no, no
No, no, no


Ahhh


[Outro]
'Cause every time you hurt me, the less that I cry
And every time you leave me, the quicker these tears dry
And every time you walk out, the less I love you
Baby, we don't stand a chance, it's sad but it's true
I'm way too good at goodbyes

[Verse 1]
Guess it's true, I'm not good at a one-night stand
But I still need love 'cause I'm just a man
These nights never seem to go to plan
I don't want you to leave, will you hold my hand?

[Chorus]
Oh, won't you stay with me?
'Cause you're all I need
This ain't love, it's clear to see
But darling, stay with me

[Verse 2]
Why am I so emotional?
No, it's not a good look, gain some self-control
And deep down I know this never works
But you can lay with me so it doesn't hurt

[Chorus]
Oh, won't you stay with me?
'Cause you're all I need
This ain't love, it's clear to see
But darling, stay with me
Oooh, oooh
Oooh, oooh

[Chorus]
Oh, won't you stay with me?
'Cause you're all I need
This ain't love, it's clear to see
But darling, stay with me

[Chorus]
Oh, won't you stay with me?
'Cause you're all I need
This ain't love, it's clear to see
But darling, stay with me

[Verse 1]
You and me, we made a vow
For better or for worse
I can't believe you let me down
But the proof's in the way it hurts
For months on end I've had my doubts
Denying every tear
I wish this would be over now
But I know that I still need you here

[Chorus]
You say I'm crazy
'Cause you don't think I know what you've done
But when you call me baby
I know I'm not the only one

[Verse 2]
You've been so unavailable
Now, sadly, I know why
Your heart is unobtainable
Even though Lord knows you kept mine

[Chorus]
You say I'm crazy
'Cause you don't think I know what you've done
But when you call me baby
I know I'm not the only one

[Bridge]
I have loved you for many years
Maybe I am just not enough
You've made me realise my deepest fear
By lying and tearing us up

[Chorus]
You say I'm crazy
'Cause you don't think I know what you've done
But when you call me baby
I know I'm not the only one

You say I'm crazy
'Cause you don't think I know what you've done
But when you call me baby
I know I'm not the only one

[Outro]
I know I'm not the only one
I know I'm not the only one
And I know, and I know, and I know, and I know, and I know, and I know, know
I know I'm not the only one

[Verse 1]
I'm young and I'm foolish, I've made bad decisions
I block out the news, turn my back on religion
Don't have no degree, I'm somewhat nave
I've made it this far on my own
But lately, that shit ain't been gettin' me higher
I lift up my head and the world is on fire
There's dread in my heart and fear in my bones
And I just don't know what to say

[Chorus]
Maybe I'll pray, pray
Maybe I'll pray
I have never believed in you, no
But I'm gonna pray

[Verse 2]
You won't find me in church 
Readin' the Bible 
I am still here and I'm still your disciple
I'm down on my knees, I'm beggin' you, please
I'm broken, alone, and afraid
I'm not a saint, I'm more of a sinner
I don't wanna lose, but I fear for the winners
When I try to explain, the words run away
That's why I am stood here today

[Chorus]
And I'm gonna pray , pray , maybe I'll pray
Pray for a glimmer of hope
Maybe I'll pray , pray , maybe I'll pray
I've never believed in you, no, but I'm gonna...

[Bridge]
Won't you call me?
Can we have a one-on-one, please?
Let's talk about freedom
Everyone prays in the end
Everyone prays in the end
Oh, won't you call me?
Can we have a one-on-one, please?
Let's talk about freedom
Everyone prays in the end
Everyone prays in the end

[Chorus]
Oh, I'm gonna pray, I'm gonna pray, I'm gonna pray
Pray for a glimmer of hope
Maybe I'll pray, pray, maybe I'll pray
I've never believed in you, no, but I'm gonna pray

[Verse 1]
Yes I do, I believe
That one day I will be where I was
Right there, right next to you
And it's hard, the days just seem so dark
The moon, and the stars are nothing without you
Your touch, your skin, where do I begin?
No words can explain the way I'm missing you
Deny this emptiness, this hole that I'm inside
These tears, they tell their own story

[Pre-Chorus]
Told me not to cry when you were gone
But the feeling's overwhelming, it's much too strong

[Chorus]
Can I lay by your side, next to you, you?
And make sure you're all right
I'll take care of you
I don't want to be here if I can't be with you tonight

[Verse 2]
I'm reaching out to you
Can you hear my call?
This hurt that I've been through
I'm missing you, missing you like crazy

[Pre-Chorus]
You told me not to cry when you were gone
But the feeling's overwhelming, it's much too strong

[Chorus]
Can I lay by your side, next to you, you?
And make sure you're all right
I'll take care of you
I don't want to be here if I can't be with you tonight

[Bridge]
Lay me down tonight, lay me by your side
Lay me down tonight, lay me by your side

[Outro]
Can I lay by your side, next to you, you?

[Verse 1]
I'm done hatin' myself for feelin'
I'm done cryin' myself awake
I gotta leave and start the healin'
But when you move like that, I just wanna stay

[Pre-Chorus]
What have I become now?
Lookin' through your phone now
Oh now, love to you is just a game
Look what I have done now
Dialling up the numbers on you
I don't want my heart to break

[Chorus]
Baby, how do you sleep when you lie to me?
All that shame and all that danger
I'm hopin' that my love will keep you up tonight
Baby, how do you sleep when you lie to me?
All that fear and all that pressure
I'm hopin' that my love will keep you up tonight

[Post-Chorus]

Love will keep you up tonight


[Verse 2]
Oh, no, how did I manage to lose me?
I am not this desperate, not this crazy
There's no way I'm stickin' 'round to find out
I won't lose like that, I won't lose myself

[Pre-Chorus]
Look what I have done 
Diallin' up the numbers on you
I don't want my heart to break

[Chorus]
Baby, how do you sleep when you lie to me?
All that shame and all that danger
I'm hopin' that my love will keep you up tonight
Baby, how do you sleep when you lie to me?
All that fear and all that pressure
I'm hopin' that my love will keep you up tonight

[Post-Chorus]

Yeah, yeah, yeah
Love will keep you up tonight

Oh, love will keep you up tonight

[Chorus]
Baby, how do you sleep when you lie to me?
All that shame and all that danger
I'm hopin' that my love will keep you up tonight
Baby, how do you sleep when you lie to me? 
All that fear and all that pressure 
I'm hopin' that my love will keep you up tonight
[Verse 1]
I've been here before
But always hit the floor
I've spent a lifetime runnin'
And I always get away
But with you I'm feeling something
That makes me want to stay
I'm prepared for this
I never shoot to miss
But I feel like a storm is coming
If I'm gonna make it through the day
Then there's no more use in runnin'
This is something I gotta face

[Pre-Chorus]
If I risk it all
Could you break my fall?

[Chorus]
How do I live? How do I breathe?
When you're not here I'm suffocating
I wanna feel love run through my blood
Tell me is this where I give it all up?
For you I have to risk it all
Cause the writing's on the wall

[Verse 2]
A million shards of glass
That haunt me from my past
As the stars begin to gather
And the light begins to fade
When all hope begins to shatter
Know that I won't be afraid

[Pre-Chorus]
If I risk it all
Could you break my fall?

[Chorus]
How do I live? How do I breathe?
When you're not here I'm suffocating
I wanna feel love, run through my blood
Tell me is this where I give it all up?
For you I have to risk it all
Cause the writing's on the wall

[Bridge]
The writing's on the wall

[Chorus]
How do I live? How do I breathe?
When you're not here I'm suffocating
I wanna feel love, run through my blood
Tell me is this where I give it all up?
How do I live? How do I breathe?
When you're not here I'm suffocating
I wanna feel love run through my blood
Tell me is this where I give it all up?
For you I have to risk it all
Cause the writing's on the wall

[Verse 1]
I choose me, and I know that's selfish, love
You are a dream, and I can't thank you enough
But I give another piece of me away
Every wakin' day that I'm with you
Am I a monster? What will your family think of me?
They brought me in, they helped me out with everything
But I give a little piece of me away
Every single day

[Chorus]
So I pick up the pieces, I get on the midnight train
I got my reasons, but darlin', I can't explain
I'll always love you
But tonight's the night I choose to walk away
Bah-bah, doo, bah-bah, doo
Bah-bah, doo, bah-bah, doo

[Verse 2]
Love you so much that I have to let you go
I'll miss your touch and the secrets we both know
But it would be wrong for me to stay
And I'll just give you hope

[Chorus]
So I pick up the pieces, I get on the midnight train
I got my reasons, but darlin', I can't explain
I'll always love you
But tonight's the night I choose to walk away
I can't stop cryin', I hate that I've caused you pain
But I can't deny it, I just don't feel the same
I'll always love you
But tonight's the night I choose to walk away
Bah-bah, doo, bah-bah, doo
Bah-bah, doo, bah-bah, doo
So I pick up the pieces, I get on the midnight train
I got my reasons, but darlin', I can't explain
I'll always love you
But tonight's the night I choose to walk away

[Verse 1]
My head is filled with ruins
Most of them, I built with you
Now the dust no longer moves
Don't disturb the ghost of you, mmm
They are empty, they are worn
Tell me what we built this for
On my way to somethin' more
You're that one I can't ignore, mmm

[Chorus]
I'm gonna miss you
I still care
Sometimes I wish we never built this palace
But real love is never a waste of time, mmm

[Verse 2]
Yeah, I know just what you're sayin'
And I regret ever complainin'
About this heart and all its breakin'
It was beauty we were makin', mmm
And I know we'll both move on
You'll forgive what I did wrong
They will love the better you
But I still own the ghost of you, mmm

[Chorus]
I'm gonna miss you
I'm still there
Sometimes I wish we never built this palace
But real love is never a waste of time, oh
I'm gonna miss you
I'm still there
Sometimes I wish we'd never built this palace
But real love is never a waste of time
But real love is never a waste of time

[Verse 1]
My mother said I'm too romantic
She said, "You're dancing in the movies"
I almost started to believe her
Then I saw you and I knew
Maybe it's 'cause I got a little bit older
Maybe it's all that I've been through
I'd like to think it's how you lean on my shoulder
And how I see myself with you

[Pre-Chorus]
I don't say a word
But still, you take my breath and steal the things I know
There you go, saving me from out of the cold

[Chorus]
Fire on fire would normally kill us
But this much desire, together, we're winners
They say that we're out of control and some say we're sinners
But don't let them ruin our beautiful rhythms
'Cause when you unfold me and tell me you love me
And look in my eye
You are perfection, my only direction
It's fire on fire, mmm
It's fire on fire

[Verse 2]
When we fight, we fight like lions
But then we love and feel the truth
We lose our minds in a city of roses
We won't abide by any rules

[Pre-Chorus]
I don't say a word
But still, you take my breath and steal the things I know
There you go, saving me from out of the cold

[Chorus]
Fire on fire would normally kill us
But this much desire, together, we're winners
They say that we're out of control and some say we're sinners
But don't let them ruin our beautiful rhythms
'Cause when you unfold me and tell me you love me
And look in my eye
You are perfection, my only direction
It's fire on fire, oh
It's fire on fire

[Bridge]
Fire on fire would normally kill us
But this much desire, together, we're winners
They say that we're out of control and some say we're sinners
But don't let them ruin our beautiful rhythms

[Chorus]
Fire on fire would normally kill us
But this much desire, together, we're winners
They say that we're out of control and some say we're sinners
But don't let them ruin our beautiful rhythms
'Cause when you unfold me and tell me you love me
And look in my eye
You are perfection, my only direction
It's fire on fire

[Outro]
You are perfection, my only direction
It's fire on fire

[Verse 1]
Holy Father, we need to talk
I have a secret that I can't keep
I'm not the boy that you thought you wanted
Please don't get angry, have faith in me

[Chorus]
Say I shouldn't be here but I can't give up his touch
It is him I love, it is him
Don't you try and tell me that God doesn't care for us
It is him I love, it is him I love

[Verse 2]
I walk the streets of Mississippi
I hold my lover by the hand
I feel you staring when he is with me
How can I make you understand?

[Chorus]
Say I shouldn't be here but I can't give up his touch
It is him I love, it is him
Don't you try and tell me that God doesn't care for us
It is him I love, it is him I love

[Bridge]
Ohh, ohh
Oh, I love
Ohh, ohh
No, no, I love
Ohh, ohh
I love
Ohh, ohh
Ohh, ohh
Him I love
Ohh, ohh
Him I love
Ohh, ohh
Him I love
Ohh, ohh
Him I love

[Outro]
Holy Father, judge my sins
I'm not afraid of what they will bring
I'm not the boy that you thought you wanted
I love him

[Verse 1: Logic]
They never knew my struggle
Rose above the rubble
Rather live inside they bubble
Than go through the trouble
Of having they double-double vision corrected
They just neglect it and
I've been thinkin' lately
Will the Devil take me?
Or will God protect me?
I know I ain't perfect, but you should respect me
They don't want me happy
They don't want to let me live

[Verse 2: Sam Smith]
I'm young and I'm foolish, I made bad decisions
I block out the news, turn my back on religion
Don't have no degree, I'm somewhat nave
I've made it this far on my own
But lately, that shit ain't been gettin' me higher
I lift up my head and the world is on fire
There's dread in my heart and fear in my bones
And I just don't know what to say

[Chorus: Sam Smith]
Maybe I'll pray, pray
Maybe I'll pray
I have never believed in you, no
But I'm gonna pray

[Verse 3: Logic]
I am me
I'm a man, I'm a sinner
But understand, aren't we all?
So when it comes to passin' judgements
I don't think that you're the one to make the call
Heaven want to cast me out for being me
I know there's others like me that'll break the fall
I know you hater motherfuckers just can't relate at all
If I'm the first one to the line, that's fine, I'll take it all
Well, Logic, he gon' let 'em know
I ain't perfect, but I'm worth it
I'm alive, I deserve it
I been praying, I ain't playin'
I don't think you hear the words that I'm sayin'
I don't think you know the weight on my shoulders
That gets heavier as I get older
Callin' anybody, callin' anybody
"Can you hear me?"
I pray that you hear me
I pray that you hear me

[Chorus: Sam Smith]
Maybe I'll pray , pray , maybe I'll pray
I've never believed in you, no, but I'm gonna...

[Bridge: Sam Smith]
Won't you call me?
Can we have a one-on-one, please?
Let's talk about freedom
Everyone prays in the end
Everyone prays in the end
Oh, won't you call me?
Can we have a one-on-one, please?
Let's talk about freedom
Everyone prays in the end
Everyone prays in the end

[Outro: Sam Smith]
Oh, I'm gonna pray
I'm gonna pray
I'm gonna pray
Pray for a glimmer of hope
Maybe I'll pray, pray
Maybe I'll pray
I've never believed in you
No, but I'm gonna pray

[Verse 1]
Maybe one day I won't sing about you
I'll sing a song about someone new
But right here, right now, you are on my mind
And I think about you all the time

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm sendin' a message to you
And I'm hopin' that it will get through

[Chorus]
When it was good, it was bittersweet, honey
You made me sad, till I loved the shade of blue
I know you don't want to talk to me, so this is what I will do
Maybe you're listenin', so here's one last song for you
Here's one last song for you

[Verse 2]
And I hope it makes you feel
And I hope it makes you burn
And I hope it reminds you of how much it hurt

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm sendin' a message to you
And I'm hopin' that it will get through

[Chorus]
When it was good, it was bittersweet, honey
You made me sad, till I loved the shade of blue
I know you don't want to talk to me, so this is what I will do
Maybe you're listenin', so here's one last song for you

[Bridge]
In case you hear this, then know you're the love of my life
Want to tell you I'm sorry, I miss havin' you by my side
When you were mine

[Chorus]
When it was good, it was bittersweet, honey
You made me sad, till I loved the shade of blue
I know you don't want to talk to me, so this is what I will do
Maybe you're listenin', so here's one last song for you
Here's one last song for you

[Intro]
I've been burnin', yes, I've been burnin'
Such a burden, this flame on my chest
No insurance, to pay for the damage
Yeah, I've been burnin' up since you left

[Verse 1]
I've been smokin', oh, more than twenty a day
Blame it on rebellion, don't blame it on me
Wish I was younger back to the nineteenth of May
I had an open mind, swore to never change

[Pre-Chorus]
Funny how time goes by
Had respect for myself that river ran dry
You reached a limit, I wasn't enough
It's like the fire replaced all the love

[Chorus]
I've been burnin', yes, I've been burnin'
Such a burden, this flame on my chest
No insurance, to pay for the damage
Yeah, I've been burnin' up since you left

[Verse 2]
Oh, if you ever called, I will run straight back
Give you my forgiveness and the shirt off my back
No friends to turn to, yeah, I messed up that
Wish we could smoke again, just for a day, oh

[Pre-Chorus]
Funny how time goes by
Had respect for myself that river ran dry
You reached a limit, I wasn't enough
And it's like the fire replaced all the love

[Chorus]
I've been burnin', yes, I've been burnin'
Such a burden, this flame on my chest
No insurance, to pay for the damage
Yeah, I've been burnin' up since you left

[Outro]
Yeah, I've been burnin' up since you left
Oh, I've been burnin' up since you left

[Intro]
It is if everyone dies alone
Does that scare you?
I don't wanna be alone

[Verse 1]
I look foryou
Everyday, every night
Iclose my eyes
From the fear, fromthe light

[Pre-Chorus]
As I wander down the avenue, so confused
Guess I'll try and force a smile

[Chorus]
Pink lemonade sippin' on a Sunday
Couples holding hands on a runway
They're all posing in a picture frame
Whilst my world's crashing down
Solo shadow on a sidewalk
Just want somebody to die for
Sunshine livin' on a perfect day
While my world's crashing down
I just want somebody to die for

[Verse 2]
I long for you
Just a touch 
Of your hand
You don't leave my mind
Lonely days, I'm feeling
Like a fool for dreaming

[Pre-Chorus]
As I wander down the avenue, so confused
Guess I'll try and force a smile

[Chorus]
Pink lemonade sippin' on a Sunday
Couples holding hands on a runway
They're all posing in a picture frame
Whilst my world's crashing down
Solo shadow on a sidewalk
Just want somebody to die for
Sunshine livin' on a perfect day
While my world's crashing down
I just want somebody to die for

[Bridge]
I just want somebody to die for 
I just want somebody to die for



[Chorus]
Pink lemonade sippin' on a Sunday
Couples holding hands on a runway 
They're all posing in a picture frame
Whilst my world's crashing down
Solo shadow on a sidewalk
Just want somebody to die for
Sunshine livin' on a perfect day
While my world's crashing down
I just want somebody to die for
I just want somebody to die for 

[Verse 1]
When I signed my deal
I felt pressure don't want to see the numbers
I want to see heaven
You say could you write a song for me?
I say I'm sorry I won't do that happily

[Pre-Chorus]
When I go home, I tend to close the door
I never wanted more, so sing with me, can't you see?

[Chorus]
I don't have money on my mind
Money on my mind
I do it for, I do it for the love
I don't have money on my mind
Money on my mind
I do it for, I do it for the love

[Post-Chorus]
I do it for the love
I do it for the love

[Verse 2]
Please don't get me wrong, I wanna keep it moving
I know what that requires, I'm not foolish
Please can you, make this work for me?
'Cause I am not a puppet, I will work against your strings

[Pre-Chorus]
When I go home, I tend to close the door
I never wanted more, so sing with me, can't you see?

[Chorus]
I don't have money on my mind
Money on my mind
I do it for, I do it for the love
I don't have money on my mind
Money on my mind
I do it for, I do it for the love

[Post-Chorus]
I do it for the love
I do it for the love

[Bridge]
When the sun will set
Don't you fret
No, I have no money on my mind
No money on my mind
No money on my mind
No, I have no money on my mind
When the sun will set
Don't you fret
No, I have no money on my mind
No money on my mind
No money on my mind
No, I have no money on my mind
Just love

[Chorus]
Money on my mind
Money on my mind
I do it for, I do it for the love
I don't have money on my mind
Money on my mind
I do it for, I do it for the love

[Post-Chorus]
I do it for the love
I do it for the love

[Verse 1]
I regret that I told the world
That you were with me
And I regret how I showed the world
That you were pretty
I never thought I'd learn so much
So much from bein' lonely
But I guess I didn't learn enough
'Cause now you won't hold me

[Chorus]
I guess I got lost in the moment
I guess I got lost in the fall
I guess I got lost in your heartbeat
In the thrill of it all
And I guess you were goddamn perfect
'Cause every single time you call
I remind myself of what I lost that night, my love
In the thrill of it all
In the thrill of it all

[Verse 2]
Even though we weren't in love
It was far from lust
Yeah, you were beautiful
But in you I could trust
Others, they warned my heart
They said I would lose fast
They said that you were stoppin' ground
And soon to be my past

[Chorus]
I guess I got lost in the moment
I guess I got lost in the fall
I guess I got lost in your heartbeat
In the thrill of it all
And I guess you were goddamn perfect
'Cause every single time you call
I remind myself of what I lost that night, my love
In the thrill of it all, oh
In the thrill of it all

[Outro]
And I guess you were goddamn perfect
'Cause every single time you call
I remind myself of what I lost that night, my love
I remind myself of what I lost that night, my love
I remind myself of what I lost that night, my love
In the thrill of it all

[Verse 1: Sam Smith & YEBBA]
I see you in the morning, feel your fingers in my hair
Sometimes I still pretend you're there
It hits me without warning, your reflection walking by
But I know it's only in my mind

[Pre-Chorus: YEBBA,  Sam Smith, Both]
Will you show me the piece of my heart I've been missin'?
Won't you give me the part of myself that I can't give back?
Will you show me the piece of my heart I've been missin'?
'Cause I'd kill for you, and darlin', you know that

[Chorus: YEBBA, Sam Smith, Both]
So I'll light up a cigarette
I'll drink it down till there's nothin' left
'Cause I sure can't get no sleep
And Lord knows there's no relief
You held my heart in your fingertips
So now I drown in my bitterness
Oh, I can't get no sleep
And I sure won't, I sure won't find no peace
No peace

[Verse 2: YEBBA & Sam Smith]
All that I am askin' is for a little clarity
That's all that really matters to me
In and out of focus, tears are in my eyes
We're burnin' down the bridges this time

[Pre-Chorus: YEBBA,  Sam Smith, Both]
Will you show me the piece of my heart I've been missin'?
Won't you give me the part of myself that I can't give back?
Will you show me the piece of my heart I've been missin'?
'Cause I'd kill for you, and darlin', you know that

[Chorus: YEBBA & Sam Smith]
So I'll light up a cigarette
I'll drink it down till there's nothin' left
'Cause I sure can't get no sleep
And Lord knows there's no relief
You held my heart in your fingertips
So now I drown in my bitterness
Oh, I can't get no sleep
And I sure won't, I sure won't find

[Bridge: Sam Smith & YEBBA]
I used to find comfort in your arms
Caught up in the wonder of your charms
Oh, I'll cry for you, I'll cry for you
I'll lie for you, I'll lie for you
But I don't even know you anymore

[Chorus: YEBBA & Sam Smith]
So I'll light up a cigarette
I'll drink it down till there's nothin' left
'Cause I sure can't get no sleep
And Lord knows there's no relief
You held my heart in your fingertips
So now I drown in my bitterness
Oh, I can't get no sleep
And I sure won't, I sure won't find no peace

[Outro: YEBBA & Both]
Sure won't find no peace, no, no
Will you give me the piece
Will you give me the piece of my heart?
Will you give me the piece
Will you give me the piece of my heart?

[Verse 1]
I never feel like this
I'm used to emptiness in my heart
And in my arms
You're not what I'm used to
You keep me guessin' with things that you do
I hope that they're true

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause I'm never gonna heal my past
If I run every time it starts
So I need to know if I'm in this alone

[Chorus]
Come on, baby, say it first
I need to hear you say those words
If I'm all that you desire, I promise there'll be fire
I need to hear you say it first
Come on, baby, do your worst
I know you'll take me higher
So come on, darling
If you love me, say it first
Say it, say it, say it
Won't you say it to me?
Say it, say it, say it
Won't you say it to me?

[Verse 2]
I know you're right for me
But I'm waiting for everything in your world
To align with my world
I think of you while I sleep
I dream of what we could be if we grow
Together unfold

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause I'm never gonna heal my past
If I run every time it starts
So I need to know if I'm in this alone

[Chorus]
Come on, baby, say it first
I need to hear you say those words
If I'm all that you desire, I promise there'll be fire
I need to hear you say it first
Come on, baby, do your worst
I know you'll take me higher
So come on, darling
If you love me, say it first
Say it, say it, say it
Won't you say it to me?
Say it, say it, say it
Won't you say it to me?
Say it first
Say it, say it, say it
Won't you say it to me?
Say it, say it, say it
Won't you say it to me?
Come on, baby, say it first
I need to hear you say those words
If I'm all that you desire, I promise there'll be fire
I need to hear you say it first
Come on, baby, do your worst
I know you'll take me higher
So come on, darling
If you love me, say it first
Say it, say it, say it
Won't you say it to me?
Say it, say it, say it
Won't you say it to me?
Say it, say it, say it
Won't you say it to me?
Say it, say it, say it
Won't you say it to me?

[Verse 1]
This is for my mother
From the older brother of your children, made of three
Now you found your lover
'Cause it wasn't our father who made you laugh and happy
It's been a long five years
I've cried a thousand tears, and here we are, after the war
But we're so much better
Now the skies are clearer, now there's no more slammin' doors

[Chorus]
Now, I say
Dear Mother, how you've come so far
Your love has fixed all of our broken hearts
I hope you're proud, Mother, of what you've done
It's a lifelong lesson and I'm not pretendin' when I say
You cleared up my scars
You cleared up my scars

[Verse 2]
This is for my father
From the older brother of your children made of three
Yeah, you've been so good to us
And showed us how to live and taught us to be free
But when Mother told you
That she didn't love you, all these bridges hit the sea
So you built another one
And helped us cross it, even though you were in need

[Chorus]
Now, I say
Dear Father, how you've come so far
Your love has fixed all of our broken hearts
I hope you're proud, Father, of what you've done
It's a lifelong lesson and I'm not pretendin' when I say
You cleared up my scars
You cleared up my scars
You cleared up my scars
You cleared up my scars

[Outro]
Dear Mother, how you've come so far
Your love has fixed all of our broken hearts
I hope you're proud, Mother, of what you've done
It's a lifelong lesson and I'm not pretendin' when I say
You cleared up my scars

[Verse 1]
You say that you're leavin', but I don't think I can let go
When you put the phone down, I began to cry
What are you to do, when the person that you love just says no?
Boy, get yourself together, move on with your life

[Pre-Chorus]
So I'm gonna play my favourite rhythm
Got to get you out my system
I would do anything to keep you off my mind
I'm gonna have to call my sisters
Be around the ones who listen
Anything to drown you out tonight

[Chorus]
Baby, you make me crazy
Why'd you have to fill my heart with sorrow?
Save me, make it all hazy
So I don't think about you till tomorrow

[Verse 2]
It wasn't enough, but you could've had the guts to face me
It would have meant so much, if you'd looked me in the eye
Why do I always fall for the ones who have no courage?
I must see some kind of beauty in their lies

[Pre-Chorus]
So I'm gonna play my favourite rhythm
Got to get you out my system
I would do anything to keep you off my mind
I'm gonna have to call my sisters
Be around the ones who listen
Anything to drown you out tonight

[Chorus]
Baby, you make me crazy
Why'd you have to fill my heart with sorrow?
Save me, make it all hazy
So I don't think about you till tomorrow
Baby, you make me crazy
Why'd you have to fill my heart with sorrow?
Save me, make it all hazy
So I don't think about you till tomorrow
Baby, you make me crazy
Why'd you have to fill my heart with sorrow?
Save me, make it all hazy
So I don't think about you till tomorrow

[Verse 1]
Oh baby, oh baby, oh
We both know the truth
If it were the real me and you
This wouldn't be the right thing to do
Now the room is all hazy
We're too lost in the fumes
I feel like it's just me and you
Yeah we got nothing to lose

[Pre-Chorus]
It's too late to run away from it all
It's too late to get away from it all
I'm done with running so
I give in to you

[Chorus]
This moment has caused a reaction
Resulting in a reattachment
Will you take me to nirvana?
I don't think this will last
But you're here in my arms

[Verse 2]
Oh baby, oh baby, oh
We both feel the same
I'm not gonna give you my name
And I don't think you want that to change
We're in this together
We don't know who we are
Even if it's moving too fast
Maybe we should take it too far

[Pre-Chorus]
It's too late to run away from it all
It's too late to get away from it all
I'm done with running so
I give in to you

[Chorus]
This moment has caused a reaction
Resulting in a reattachment
Will you take me to nirvana?
I don't think this will last
But you're here in my arms

[Half Chorus]
Will you take me to nirvana?
I don't think this will last
Cause you're here in my arms
Will you take me to nirvana?
I don't think this will last
Cause you're here in my arms

[Verse 1]
Running 'round, chasing hearts
Chasing bodies to fix the parts
I don't know how I reached this place
So far from heaven, so far from grace

[Pre-Chorus]
Am I wrong to give in to the pressure?
'Cause I feel like the city's got the better of me
Oh, this casual love isn't what it seems
And I try to imagine something closer
And somebody who is good for me
I'm so tired of all this searching
Do I, do I, do I, do I...

[Chorus]
Go home to nothing or stay out for more?
Give in to someone or lock down my door?
Or drown all my shadows, drown them like before?
I'm drowning shadows once more

[Verse 2]
The more I drink, the more I drown
If I'm not thinking, I won't get down
The more I rise above it all
The less I care about the fall

[Pre-Chorus]
Am I wrong to give in to the pressure?
'Cause I feel like the city's got the better of me
Oh, this casual love isn't what it seems
And I try to imagine something closer
And somebody who is good for me
I'm so tired of all this searching
Do I, do I, do I, do I...

[Chorus]
Go home to nothing or stay out for more?
Give in to someone or lock down my door?
Or drown all my shadows, drown them like before?
I'm drowning shadows once more
Once more
Once more, ooh

[Chorus]
Go home to nothing or stay out for more?
Give in to someone or lock down my door?
Or drown all my shadows, drown them like before?
I'm drowning shadows once more

[Verse 1]
Let's turn off our phones tonight
And rely on the stars
We've been so lost lately
We forgot who we are
But I got everything I need, baby
In the palms of your touch
In a world of dark distractions
It can all get too much

[Chorus]
So let's sit by an English river
Till the water runs dry
Can we light a cigarette
And talk about days gone by?
We're neither saints or sinners
So leave your history behind
Let's grab a bottle and take it one day at a time
Take it one day at a time

[Verse 2]
I know you're feelin' weighed down tonight
And you can't find the breaks
Every day is too long for you
You are sworn to your fate
But we got everything we need, baby
In the memories we make
In a world of reinventions
It's never too late

[Chorus]
So let's sit by an English river
Till the water runs dry
Can we light a cigarette
And talk about days gone by?
We're neither saints or sinners
So leave your history behind
Let's grab a bottle and take it one day at a time
Take it one day at a time, mmm
Oh, so let's sit by an English river
Till the water runs dry
There is nothin' that we've done wrong
That can't be made right
We're neither saints or sinners
So leave your history behind
Let's grab a bottle and take it
Grab a bottle and take it
Grab a bottle and take it one day at a time

[Verse 1]
And I hate to say I love you
When it's so hard for me
And I hate to say I want you
When you make it so clear
You don't want me

[Chorus]
I'd never ask you 'cause deep down
I'm certain I know what you'd say
You'd say "I'm sorry, believe me, I love you
But not in that way"

[Verse 2]
And I hate to say I need you
I'm so reliant, I'm so dependent, I'm such a fool
When you're not there, I find myself singing the blues
Can't bear, can't face the truth

[Bridge]
You will never know that feeling
You will never see through these eyes

[Chorus]
I'd never ask you 'cause deep down
I'm certain I know what you'd say
You'd say "I'm sorry, believe me, I love you
But not in that way"

[Outro]
You'd say "I'm sorry, believe me, I love you
But not in that way"

[Verse 1]
Maybe I'm done, maybe it's true
Maybe I had one chance and I lost it with you
We fell so hard, with nothing to lose
I'll never love again, I'll never love you

[Chorus]
'Cause I gave my heart to a goddamn fool
I gave him everything
Now there's nothing left for you
'Cause I gave 
My heart 
To a goddamn fool
Oh, I lost everything
Now I have nothing left for you
I have nothing left for you

[Verse 2]
Mm, I can't pretend, pretend that I care
I see how you look at me, but I am not there
The damage is done, I'll save you the time
And if there are feelings there, they are not mine

[Chorus]
'Cause I gave 
My heart 
To a goddamn fool
I gave him everything
Now there's nothing left for you
'Cause I gave 
My heart 
To a goddamn fool
I lost everything
And I have nothing left for you
Oh, I have nothing left for you

[Bridge]
You won't hear me say those words again
This is something that you cannot mend
Can't you see I am a product of my own past?
So I know this will never last
And I will not cover your fears
I will not pick up your tears
I'll live out the rest of my days alone

[Chorus]
'Cause I gave my heart to a goddamn fool
I gave him everything
Now there's nothing left for you
'Cause I gave my heart to a goddamn fool
I lost everything
And I have nothing left for you

[Verse 1: A$AP Rocky]
A new disease in my town called Idiotic
Every pretty lady in my city got it, point blank
Periodically empty seats, dine at Cipriani's
Like Beyonc, they're getting by or they get embodied
So Sasha Fierce, a whole lot of tears
Rolling down her cheeks, crying till she's sound asleep
Preach, pray that today is not a lonely one
You gotta know you not the only one

[Verse 2: Sam Smith]
You and me, we made a vow
For better or for worse
I can't believe you let me down
But the proof is in the way it hurts
For months on end I've had my doubts
Denying every tear
I wish this would be over now
But I know that I still need you here

[Chorus: Sam Smith]
You say I'm crazy
Cause you don't think I know what you've done
But when you call me baby
I know I'm not the only one

[Verse 3: Sam Smith]
You've been so unavailable
Now sadly I know why
Your heart is unobtainable
Even though Lord knows you kept mine

[Chorus: Sam Smith]
You say I'm crazy
Cause you don't think I know what you've done
But when you call me baby
I know I'm not the only one

[Verse 4/Bridge: A$AP Rocky]
We all guilty of the same crime
If you ask me, I might've had a couple women at the same time
But you handle the pressure, Jack Daniels for breakfast
A cap of valium mixed with antidepressants, precious
My momma said that we need love
Till I found out life's a bitch with no prenup, you're on your own
Divorces or court splits, decisions and choices
The Porsche or the fortress? Ignore it or forefeit

[Chorus: Sam Smith]
You say I'm crazy
Cause you don't think I know what you've done
But when you call me baby
I know I'm not the only one
I know I'm not the only one
I know I'm not the only one
And I know and I know and I know and I know and I know
And I don't know
I know I'm not the only one

[Verse 1]
My mind runs away to you
With a thought I hope you'll see
Can't see where it's wandered to
But I know where it wants to be

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm waiting patiently
Though time is moving slow
I have one vacancy
And I wanted you to know that

[Chorus]
You're the one, designed for me
A distant stranger, that I will complete
I know you're out there, we're meant to be
So keep your head up, and make it to me

[Verse 2]
So sick of this lonely air
It seems such a waste of breath
So much that I need to share
So much to get off my chest

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm waiting patiently
Though time is moving slow
I have one vacancy
And I wanted you to know that

[Chorus]
You're the one, designed for me
A distant stranger, that I will complete
I know you're out there, we're meant to be
So keep your head up, and make it to me

[Outro]
And make it to me
And make it to me
And make it to me
And make it to me

[Verse 1]
He could be a sinner, or a gentleman
He could be a preacher, when your soul is damned
He could be a lawyer on a witness stand
But he'll never love you like I can, can
He could be a stranger you gave a second glance
He could be a trophy of a one night stand
He could have your humour, but I don't understand
He'll never love you like I can, can, can

[Chorus]
Why are you looking down all the wrong roads?
When mine is the heart and the salt of the soul
There may be lovers who hold out their hands
But theyll never love you like I can, can, can
They'll never love you like I can, can

[Verse 3]
A chance encounter of circumstance
Baby he's a mantra, keeps your mind entranced
He could be the silence in this mayhem
But then again, hell never love you like I can, can, can

[Chorus]
Why are you looking down all the wrong roads?
When mine is the heart and the salt of the soul
There may be lovers who hold out their hands
But theyll never love you like I can, can, can
They'll never love you like I can, can

[Bridge]
We both have demons that we can't stand
I love your demons, like devils can
If you're self-seeking, an honest man
Then stop deceiving, Lord please

[Chorus]
Why are you looking down all the wrong roads?
When mine is the heart and the salt of the soul
There may be lovers who hold out their hands
But theyll never love you like I can, can, can
They'll never love you like I can, can

[Verse 1]
I don't have much to give, but I don't care for gold
What use is money, when you need someone to hold?
Don't have direction, I'm just rolling down this road
Waiting for you to bring me in from out the cold

[Pre-Chorus]
You'll never know the endless nights
The rhyming of the rain
Or how it feels to fall behind
And watch you call his name

[Chorus]
Pack up and leave everything
Don't you see what I can bring?
Can't keep this beating heart at bay
Set my midnight sorrow free
I will give you all of me
Just leave your lover, leave him for me
Leave your lover, leave him for me

[Verse 2]
We sit in bars and raise our drinks to growing old
Oh, I'm in love with you and you will never know
But if I can't have you I'll walk this life alone
Spare you the rising storm and let the rivers flow

[Pre-Chorus]
You'll never know the endless nights
The rhyming of the rain
Or how it feels to fall behind
And watch you call his name

[Chorus]
Pack up and leave everything
Don't you see what I can bring?
Can't keep this beating heart at bay
Set my midnight sorrow free
I will give you all of me
Just leave your lover, leave him for me
Leave your lover, leave him for me

[Verse 1]
You know what I mean
It's like walking in the heat all day with no water
It's like waiting for a friend
Watching everybody else meet theirs on that corner
Or losing in an argument
Though you're right, can't get your thoughts in order

[Pre-Chorus]
Still I refrain from talking at you, talking on
You know me well, I don't explain

[Chorus]
But what the hell?
Why do you think I come round here on my free will?
Wasting all my precious time
Oh, the truth spills out
And oh, oh I, I've told you now

[Verse 2]
You know what I mean
Although I try my best I still let down the team
You're everything I want
Why should I resist when you are there for me?

[Pre-Chorus]
Still I refrain from talking at you, talking on
You know me well, I don't explain

[Chorus]
But what the hell?
Why do you think I come round here on my free will?
Wasting all my precious time
Oh, the truth spills out
And oh, oh I, I've told you now

[Bridge]
I've told you now
I've told you now
I've told you now
I've told you now

[Pre-Chorus]
Still I refrain from talking at you, talking on
You know me well, I don't explain

[Chorus]
But what the hell?
Why do you think I come round here on my free will?
Wasting all my precious time
Oh, the truth spills out
And oh, oh I, I've told you now
But what the hell?
Why do you think I come round here on my free will?
Wasting all my precious time
Oh, the truth spills out
And oh, oh I, I've told you now

[Verse 1]
You lift my heart up when the rest of me is down
You, you enchant me even when you're not around
If there are boundaries, I will try to knock them down
Im latching on, babe, now I know what I have found

[Pre-Chorus]
I feel we're close enough
Could I lock in your love?
I feel were close enough
Could I lock in your love?

[Chorus]
Now Ive got you in my space
I wont let go of you
Got you shackled in my embrace
Im latching on to you

[Verse 2]
Im so encaptured, got me wrapped up in your touch
Feel so enamored, hold me tight within your clutch
How do you do it? You got me losing every breath
What did you give me to make my heart beat out my chest?

[Pre-Chorus]
I feel we're close enough
Could I lock in your love?
I feel were close enough
Could I lock in your love?

[Chorus]
Now Ive got you in my space
I wont let go of you
Got you shackled in my embrace
Im latching on to you

[Chorus]
Now Ive got you in my space
I wont let go of you
Got you shackled in my embrace
Im latching on to you

Im latching on to you

[Verse 1]
I had a dream I was mugged outside your house
I had a dream in a panic you came running out
For a moment you were sure I'd die on you
For a moment I believed you loved me too
But life is never like this, and you were never strong

[Chorus]
Too much of a good thing won't be good for long
Although you made my heart sing, to stay with you would be wrong
Too much of a good thing won't be good anymore
Watch where I tread before I fall

[Verse 2]
We talk maybe twenty times a day
And still I never say what I want to say
I thought I wouldn't need to
I guess I read you wrong

[Chorus]
Too much of a good thing won't be good for long
Although you made my heart sing, to stay with you would be wrong
Too much of a good thing won't be good anymore
Watch where I tread before I fall

[Bridge]
You refuse to see this, dont see it anymore
I have made a decision not to answer your calls
Cause I put everything out there and I got nothing at all

[Outro]
Too much of a good thing isn't good and you know
I watch where I walk before I fall
Before I fall

[Verse 1]
I've been sleeping with the lights on
Cause the darkness is surrounding you
This is my world, this is my choice
And you're the drug that gets me through

[Pre-Chorus]
I've been waiting for an answer
Because I built this bed for two
I'm just hanging on your answer
I built this bed for me and you

[Chorus]
Can't you see that I am yours?
So will you be my life support?
You're my life support
You're my life support

[Verse 2]
Sick of waking up in darkness
When the sky is always painted blue
There's a method to my madness
Its clear that you dont have a clue

[Pre-Chorus]
I've been waiting for an answer
Because I built this bed for two
I'm just hanging on your answer
I built this bed for me and you

[Chorus]
Can't you see that I am yours?
So will you be my life support?
You're my life support
You're my life support

[Outro]
Can't you see that I am yours?
So will you be my life support?
I've been sleeping with the lights on
Cause the darkness is surrounding you[Instrumental break]

[Verse 1]
If you ever need me
Just tell me, and Ill be there
Cause I was built for you
Yes, I was built to carry all your feelings

[Pre-Chorus]
Cause I wont let them know
I wont let you go, baby
I dont care what your past is
I dont need no answers
Just have faith in me

[Hook]
Dont you know your secrets safe with me?

All your worries can be put to, can be put to sleep

Dont you know your secrets safe with me?

All your worries can be put to sleep


[Verse 2]
No need to step back
Dont be scared, I got you, you know that
Im here when youre sad
When all of your clouds turn black

[Pre-Chorus]
Cause I wont let them know
I wont let you go, baby
I dont care what your past is
I dont need no answers
Just have faith in me

[Hook]
Dont you know your secrets safe with me?

All your worries can be put to, can be put to sleep

Dont you know your secrets safe with me?

All your worries can be put to sleep
[Verse 1]
Oh it's you I know, you're the one I dream of
Looks into my eyes, takes me to the clouds above
Oh I lose control, can't seem to get enough
When I wake from dream, tell me is it really love

[Chorus]
How will I know if you really love me
I say a prayer with every heart beat
I fall in love whenever we meet
I'm asking you what you know about these things

How will I know if you're thinking of me
I try to phone but I'm too shy 
Falling in love is so bitter sweet
This love is strong why do I feel weak

[Verse 2]
Oh wake me, I'm shaking, wish I had you near me now
Said there's no mistaking, what I feel is really love

[Pre-Chorus]
How will I know
How will I know
How will I know
How will I know

[Chorus]
How will I know if you really love me
I say a prayer with every heart beat
I fall in love whenever we meet
I'm asking you what you know about these things

How will I know if you're thinking of me
I try to phone but I'm too shy 
Falling in love is so bitter sweet
This love is strong why do I feel weak

[Verse 1]
You can reach me by railway
You can reach me by trail-way
You can reach me on an airplane
You can reach me with your mind
You can reach me by caravan
Cross the desert like an Arab man
I don't care how you get here, just get here if you can

[Verse 2]
You can reach me by sailboat
Climb a tree and swing rope to rope
Take a sled and slide down slow, into these arms of mine
You can jump on a speedy colt
Cross the border in a blaze of hope
I don't care how you get here, just get here if you can

[Chorus]
There are hills and mountains between us
Always something to get over
If I had my way, then surely you would be closer
I need you closer

[Verse 3]
You can windsurf into my life
Take me up on a carpet ride
You can make it in a big balloon
But you better make it soon
You can reach me by caravan
Cross the desert like an Arab man
I don't care how you get here, just get here if you can

I don't care how you get here, just get here if you can
Get here if you can[Produced by Zane Lowe]

[Verse 1]
It was a Monday night when you told me it was over babe
And by the Friday night, I knew that I would be okay
Don't say it was a good thing
Don't say it was the right thing to do
Don't say it was the best thing for the both of us
When I'm the one playing the fool

[Chorus]
What do you want from me when I just want a restart?
You keep coming back for me when you're the one who tore us apart
And the truth is I'm better on my own
And I don't want to live in the past
So let me restart
So let me restart
So let me restart

[Verse 2]
You've been lighting up my phone
Worried that I'll be alone tonight
Want to make sure that I'm fine
But baby you're not on my mind no more
I know it was the best thing for the both of us
Cause you're the one who looks like the fool

[Chorus]
What do you want from me when I just want a restart?
You keep coming back for me when you're the one who tore us apart
And the truth is I'm better on my own
And I don't want to live in the past
So let me restart
So let me restart
So let me restart

So let me restart

What do you want from me when I just want a restart?
You keep coming back for me when you're the one who tore us apart
And the truth is I'm better on my own
And I don't want to live in the past
So let me restart
So let me restart
So let me restart
So let me restart
So let me restart
Hmmmm

[Verse]
For you I was a flame
Love is a losing game
Five story fire as you came
Love is a losing game
One I wish I never played
Oh what a mess we made
And now the final frame
Love is a losing game
Played out by the band
Love is a losing hand
More than I could stand
Love is a losing hand
Self professed, profound
'Til the chips were down
Know you're a gambling man
Love is a losing hand
And though I batted blind
Love is a fate resigned
Memories mar my mind
Love is a fate resigned
Over futile odds
And laughed at by the gods
And now the final frame
Love is a losing game

[Verse 1: Sam Smith]
Yes I do, I believe
That one day I will be where I was
Right there, right next to you
And it's hard, the days just seem so dark
The moon, the stars are nothing without you
Your touch, your skin, where do I begin?
No words can explain the way I'm missing you
Deny this emptiness, this hole that I'm inside
These tears, they tell their own story

[Pre-Chorus: Sam Smith]
Told me not to cry when you were gone
But the feeling's overwhelming, it's much too strong

[Chorus: Sam Smith]
Can I lay by your side, next to you, you?
And make sure you're alright
I'll take care of you
I don't want to be here if I can't be with you tonight

[Verse 2: John Legend]
I'm reaching out to you
Can you hear my call ?
This hurt that I've been through
I'm missing you, missing you like crazy

[Chorus: Sam Smith & John Legend]
Can I lay by your side, next to you, you?
And make sure you're alright
I'll take care of you
I don't want to be here if I can't be with you tonight

[Outro: Sam Smith & John Legend]
Lay me down tonight, lay me by your side
Lay me down tonight, lay me by your side
Can I lay by your side, next to you, you-ou

[Intro]
KSR
It's Cardi, ayy
Said I'm the shit, they can't fuck with me if they wanted to
I dont gotta dance

[Chorus]
Said lil' bitch, you can't fuck with me if you wanted to
These expensive, these is red bottoms, these is bloody shoes
Hit the store, I can get 'em both, I don't wanna choose
And I'm quick, cut a nigga off, so don't get comfortable, look
I don't dance now, I make money moves 
Say I don't gotta dance, I make money move
If I see you and I don't speak, that means I don't fuck with you
I'm a boss, you a worker, bitch, I make bloody moves

[Verse 1]
Now she say she gon' do what to who? Let's find out and see
Cardi B, you know where I'm at, you know where I be
You in the club just to party, I'm there, I get paid a fee
I be in and out them banks so much, I know they're tired of me
Honestly, don't give a fuck 'bout who ain't fond of me
Dropped two mixtapes in six months, what bitch working as hard as me?
I don't bother with these hoes, don't let these hoes bother me
They see pictures, they say, "Goals," bitch, I'm who they tryna be
Look, I might just chill in some BAPE
I might just chill with your boo, I might just feel on your babe
My pussy feel like a lake
He wanna swim with his face, I'm like, "Okay"
I'll let him get what he want, he buy me Yves Saint Laurent
And the new whip, when I go fast as a horse, I got the trunk in the front
I'm the hottest in the street, know you prolly heard of me
Got a bag and fixed my teeth, hope you hoes know it ain't cheap
And I pay my mama bills, I ain't got no time to chill
Think these hoes be mad at me, their baby father run a bill

[Chorus]
Said lil' bitch, you can't fuck with me if you wanted to
These expensive, these is red bottoms, these is bloody shoes
Hit the store, I can get 'em both, I don't wanna choose
And I'm quick, cut a nigga off, so don't get comfortable, look
I don't dance now, I make money moves
Say I don't gotta dance, I make money move
If I see you and I don't speak, that means I don't fuck with you
I'm a boss, you a worker, bitch, I make bloody moves

[Verse 2]
If you a pussy, you get popped, you a goofy, you a opp
Don't you come around my way, you can't hang around my block
And I just checked my accounts, turns out, I'm rich, I'm rich, I'm rich
I put my hand above my hip, I bet you dip, he dip, she dip
I say I get the money and go, this shit is hot like a stove
My pussy glitter is gold, tell that lil' bitch play her role
I just arrove in a Rolls, I just came up in a Wraith
I need to fill up the tank, no, I need to fill up the safe
I need to let all these hoes know that none of their niggas is safe
I go to dinner and steak, only the real can relate
I used to live in the P's, now it's a crib with a gate
Rollie got charms, look like Frosted Flakes
Had to let these bitches know, just in case these hoes forgot
I just run and check the mail, another check from Mona Scott

[Chorus]
Said lil' bitch, you can't fuck with me if you wanted to
These expensive, these is red bottoms, these is bloody shoes
Hit the store, I can get 'em both, I don't wanna choose
And I'm quick, cut a nigga off, so don't get comfortable, look
I don't dance now, I make money moves
Say I don't gotta dance, I make money move
If I see you and I don't speak, that means I don't fuck with you
I'm a boss, you a worker, bitch, I make bloody moves

[Intro]
Yeah
Care for me, care for me, care for me, uh
Yeah, look

[Verse 1]
I wanna get married, like the Currys, Steph and Ayesha shit
But we more like BellyTommy and Keisha shit
Gave you TLC, you wanna creep and shit
Poured out my whole heart to a piece of shit
Man, I thought you would've learned your lesson
'Bout likin' pictures, not returnin' texts
I guess it's fine, man, I get the message
You still stutter after certain questions
You keep in contact with certain exes
Do you, though, trust me, nigga, it's cool, though
Said that you was workin', but you out here chasin' culo
And putas, chillin' poolside, livin' two lives
I could've did what you did to me to you a few times
But if I did decide to slide, find a nigga
Fuck him, suck his dick, you would've been pissed
But that's not my M.O., I'm not that type of bitch
And karma for you is gon' be who you end up with
You make me sick, nigga

[Chorus]
The only man, baby, I adore
I gave you everything, what's mine is yours
I want you to live your life of course
But I hope you get what you dyin' for
Be careful with me, do you know what you doin'?
Whose feelings that you're hurtin' and bruisin'?
You gon' gain the whole world
But is it worth the girl that you're losin'?
Be careful with me
Yeah, it's not a threat, it's a warnin'
Be careful with me
Yeah, my heart is like a package with a fragile label on it
Be careful with me

[Bridge]
Care for me, care for me
Always said that you'd be there for me, there for me
Boy, you better treat me carefully, carefully, look

[Verse 2]
I was here before all of this
Guess you actin' out now, you got an audience
Tell me where your mind is, drop a pin, what's the coordinates?
You might have a fortune, but you lose me, you still gon' be misfortunate, nigga
Tell me, this lust got you this fucked up in the head
You want some random bitch up in your bed?
She don't even know your middle name, watch her 'cause she might steal your chain
You don't want someone who loves you instead? I guess not though
It's blatant disrespect, you nothin' like the nigga I met
Talk to me crazy and you quick to forget
You even got me trippin', you got me lookin' in the mirror different
Thinkin' I'm flawed because you inconsistent
Between a rock and a hard place, the mud and the dirt
It's gon' hurt me to hate you, but lovin' you's worse
It all stops so abrupt, we started switchin' it up
Teach me to be like you so I can not give a fuck
Free to mess with someone else, I wish these feelings could melt
'Cause you don't care about a thing except your mothafuckin' self
You make me sick, nigga

[Chorus]
The only man, baby, I adore
I gave you everything, what's mine is yours
I want you to live your life of course
But I hope you get what you dyin' for
Be careful with me, do you know what you doin'?
Whose feelings that you're hurtin' and bruisin'?
You gon' gain the whole world
But is it worth the girl that you're losin'?
Be careful with me
Yeah, it's not a threat, it's a warnin'
Be careful with me
Yeah, my heart is like a package with a fragile label on it
Be careful with me

[Verse 1]
Look, my bitches all bad, my niggas all real
I ride on his dick in some big tall heels
Big fat checks, big large bills
Front, I'll flip like ten cartwheels
Cold ass bitch, I give broads chills
Ten different looks and my looks all kill
I kiss him in the mouth, I feel all grills
He eat in the car, that's meals on wheels 

[Chorus]
I was born to flex 
Diamonds on my neck
I like boardin' jets, I like mornin' sex 
But nothing in this world that I like more than checks 
All I really wanna see is the 
I don't really need the D, I need the 
All a bad bitch need is the 
I got bands in the coupe 
Bustin' out the roof
I got bands in the coupe 
Touch me, I'll shoot 
Shake a lil ass 
Get a little bag and take it to the store 
Get a little cash 
Shake it real fast and get a little more 
I got bands in the coupe 
Bustin' out the roof
I got bands in the coupe 
Bustin' out the roof 

[Verse 2]
I gotta fly, I need a jet, shit
I need room for my legs
I got a baby, I need some money, yeah
I need cheese for my egg
All y'all bitches in trouble
Bring brass knuckles to the scuffle
I heard that Cardi went pop
Yeah, I did go pop 
That's me bustin' they bubble
I'm Dasani with the drip
Baby mommy with the clip
Walk out Follie's with a bitch
Bring a thottie to the whip
If she fine or she thick, goddamn
Walkin' past the mirror, ooh
Damn, I'm fine 
Let a bitch try me, boom 
Hammer time, uh

[Chorus]
I was born to flex 
Diamonds on my neck
I like boardin' jets, I like mornin' sex 
But nothing in this world that I like more than checks 
All I really wanna see is the 
I don't really need the D, I need the 
All a bad bitch need is the 
I got bands in the coupe 
Bustin' out the roof
I got bands in the coupe 
Touch me, I'll shoot 
Shake a lil ass 
Get a little bag and take it to the store 
Get a little cash 
Shake it real fast and get a little more 
I got bands in the coupe 
Bustin' out the roof
I got bands in the coupe 
Touch me, I'll shoot 

[Verse 3]
Bitch, I will pop on your pops 
Bitch, I will pop on whoever 
You know who pop the most shit? 
The people whose shit not together 
You'da bet Cardi a freak 
All my pajamas is leather 
Bitch, I will black on your ass 
Wakanda forever
Sweet like a honey bun, spit like a Tommy gun
Rollie a one of one, come get your mommy some
Cardi at the tip-top, bitch
Kiss the ring and kick rocks, sis 
Jump it down, back it up 
Make that nigga put down 2K
I like my niggas dark like D'USS
He gonna eat this ass like souffl

[Chorus]
I was born to flex, diamonds on my neck
I like boardin' jets, I like mornin' sex
But nothing in this world that I like more than Kulture

All I really wanna see is the 
I don't really need the D, I need the 
All a bad bitch need is the
K.K.C

[Intro]
Monsta's gon' tear it up
Bardi
Woo, yeah
Bitches be pressed 
Bitches be pressed 
Woo, yeah, yeah, woo

[Verse 1]
Bitches be pressed 
They knew how I'm coming, real bitch in the flesh 
Who the fuck she gon' check? 
She be talking that shit, talkin' out of her neck 
Put blood on her dress 
Bitches be mad when they see Cardi step in the spot 
Said that you 'bout it, we know that you not
I'ma pull up on bitches as soon as I drop
Bought a new foreign, I might cop a yacht 
Bitches in my business, they tryna plot 
Hoes poppin' shit like they hot but they not 
Just flooded the wrist, the Patek, the watch 
Niggas be flexing, we know what you got
Cardi done had got the game in a knot
Fuckin' your nigga, I got him on lock
This go bang bang like I'm choppin' them chops
VVS chain, I'm in love with the rocks 
You said you gon' take it, bitch, you got me chopped 
They throwin' shade 'cause they see me on top
Tell that bitch to pull up, I'ma send you the drop

[Chorus]
Press, press, press, press, press
Cardi don't need more press
Kill 'em all, put them hoes to rest
Walk in, bulletproof vest
Please tell me who she gon' check
Murder scene, Cardi made a mess
Pop up, guess who, bitch?
Pop up, guess who, bitch?

[Verse 2]
Ding dong
Must be that whip that I ordered
And a new crib for my daughter
You know a bad bitch gon' spoil her
Got one in New York, need one in Georgia 
New Bentley truck cost a quarter 
My money still long like weave 
Pussy still wet like Florida 
Everyone drop on the floor
She was talkin' but not anymore 
MAC to your face like contour 
This chopper come straight from Dior
Done with the talkin', I'm open to violence
Ask anybody, they know I'm about it
Hashtag whip that ho ass
Fuck around, we gon' start a new challenge 
I come in this bitch and I'm strapped up and ready
Ridin' that dick like I'm Cardi Andretti
Fuck at your crib, we don't go to no 'telly
I sit on his face whenever I'm ready 
Bitch I'm a freak like Greek 
Got the biggest house on my street 
All you little hoes look cheap 
They suckin' on my dick with no teeth

[Chorus]
Press, press, press, press, press
Cardi don't need more press
Kill 'em all, put them hoes to rest
Walk in, bulletproof vest
Please tell me who she gon' check
Murder scene, Cardi made a mess
Pop up, guess who, bitch?
Pop up, guess who, bitch?

[Outro]
Press, press, press, press
Press, press, press, press
Press, press, press, press
Pop up, guess who, bitch?
Pop up, guess who, bitch?

[Intro]
M-M-M-Murda

[Chorus: SZA]
Left a nigga on read 'cause I felt like it
Dress me down in that Raf, Saint Laurent jacket
Dapper, dapper, I look fine and my checks divine
No wonder, wonder why I do whatever I like
I do what I like, I do, I do
I do what I like, I do, I do
I do what I like, I do, I do
I do what I like, I do, I do

[Verse 1: Cardi B]
I think us, bad bitches, is a gift from God 
I think you broke hoes need to get a job 
Now I'm a boss, I write my own name on the checks 
Pussy so good, I say my own name during sex
I might smack a bitch 'cause I felt like it
Gucci shoes and a belt like it
Said that Cardi is his favorite fragrance
I'm a rich bitch and I smell like it
I'm in a boss bitch mood, ayy, these heels are Givenchy, ho
These are some boss bitch shoes
If you ain't no boss bitch, move, ayy
For the record, I set record record sales
I like niggas that been in and outta jail
They said by now that I'll be finished, hard to tell 
My little fifteen minutes lasting long as hell, huh?

[Chorus: SZA]
Left a nigga on read 'cause I felt like it
Dress me down in that Raf, Saint Laurent jacket
Dapper, dapper, I look fine and my checks divine
No wonder, wonder why I do whatever I like
I do what I like, I do, I do
I do what I like, I do, I do
I do what I like, I do, I do
I do what I like, I do, I do

[Verse 2: Cardi B]
Look, broke hoes do what they can 
Good girls do what they told 
Bad bitches do what they want 
That's why a bitch is so cold
I'm a gangsta in a dress, I'm a bully in the bed
Only time that I'm a lady's when I lay these hoes to rest
The coupe is roofless, but I get top in it
I'm provocative, it's my prerogative
80K just to know what time is it
Cardi rockin' it, go buy stock in it
Spend what I want, ain't no limit
I say what I want, I ain't never been timid
Only real shit comes out my mouth and only real niggas go in it
Leave his texts on read, leave his balls on blue
Put it on airplane mode so none of those calls come through
Here's a word to my ladies, don't you give these niggas none 
If they can't make you richer, they can't make you cum 

[Chorus: SZA]
I left a nigga on read 'cause I felt like it
Dress me down in that Raf, Saint Laurent jacket
Dapper, dapper, I look fine, and my checks divine
No wonder, wonder why I do whatever I like
I do what I like, I do, I do
I do what I like, I do, I do
I do what I like, I do, I do
I do what I like, I do, I do

[Verse 1: Cardi B]
Give me little something to remember 
Tryna make love in a Sprinter 
Quick to drop a nigga like Kemba 
Lookin' like a right swipe on Tinder 
Shit on these hoes 
Light up my wrist on these hoes 
Now I look down on these bitches 
I feel like I'm on stilts on these hoes 
Fuck ya' baby daddy right now 
Anna Mae, got cake by the pound 
Go down, eat it up, don't drown
Mac n' cheese in the bowl, how it sound? 
I got that gushy
Yeah that's a fact, but I never been pussy
I've been that bitch since pajamas with footies
Won MVP, and I'm still a rookie, like woo
I gotta work on my anger 
Might kill a bitch with my fingers 
I gotta stay outta Gucci 
I'm finna run outta hangers 
Is she a stripper, a rapper or a singer?
I'm busting bucks in a Bentley Bentayga
Ride through your hood like "Bitch, I'm the mayor!"
You not my bitch, then bitch you in danger

[Chorus: Cardi B & Offset]
Came through drippin' 
Came through drippin'

Bitch you a thot, ain't trickin' 
Put her on her knee, make her lick it 
Patek on my wrist, and it's glistenin' 
The bitch got mad, I dissed her 

[Verse 2: Offset]
Shawty, you ain't nothin' to a rich nigga 
I'll put a check on a bitch nigga 
Fuck your whole set and your clique, nigga 
Got a gang full of dud and some broke niggas 
Diamonds on me, what's the price? 
I'm not gettin' involved with the hype 
I'm too rich to get into a fight 
50 racks got my jeans fittin' tight 
Pay the price and them boys come and wipe ya' 
We had to dispose of the diaper 
Yeah we trap every week, every night 
Word my move, we too smooth, no indictments 
Yeah, freakazoid lightnin' 
57 90 in this Breitling 
When I got a mil I got excited 
For the cash I'ma turn to Michael Myers
Baguettes keep dripping, droppin' 
My wrist all liquid watches 
Told the bitch, "Jump on my dick and pop it" 
Get a little bitch a deposit 

[Chorus: Cardi B]
Came through drippin' 
Came through drippin' 
Came through drippin' 
Diamonds on my wrist, they drippin'

Bitch you a thot, ain't trickin'

The bitch got mad, I dissed her 

[Verse 3: Takeoff]
Take-Takeoff
Came through drippin' 
I ain't never slippin', I'm a pimp 
Fuckin' with a quarter million, nigga, what a feelin' 
Abort the mission, nigga, they be tellin' off and squealin' 
Splash, took a bitch to Piccadilly 
Water in my ear, gave a nigga wet willy 
Came through drippin', spillin'
Walkin' with the bag 
Tryna get my niggas all a milli, stack it to the ceilin' 
Shootin' at civilians 
I'm the one dealin', I could make a killin' 
Bags, can you smell it when I Vac-seal it? 
Flag, nigga, throw it up, don't care about your feelings 
Ooh, what is this? What you wearin'? I be drippin' 
Cal Ripken's hit a nigga, Ken Griffey 
The bitch got thick, so I guess she ate Jiffy
When she leave with me, I'ma fly her back to the city 

[Verse 4: Quavo]
Go get the bag on the day off 
Go get the rings out the playoffs 
Pots in the beat, it's a bake off 
Fuck on her, then she get laid off 
Big boy tools, Maaco 
Make a bitch dance with a Draco 
Walkin' with the cheese, that queso 
That's Huncho, fuck the Rodeo 
Private jet, we don't do layover 
One call, I'm havin' your bae over 
Walk out the spot with a makeover 
Got her addicted to payola 

[Chorus: Cardi B & Offset]
Came through drippin' 
Came through drippin' 
Came through drippin' 
Diamonds on my wrist, they drippin' 
Came through drippin' 
Came through drippin' 
Came through drippin' 
Diamonds on my wrist, they drippin' 
Came through drippin' 
Came through drippin' 
Came through drippin' 
Diamonds on my wrist, they drippin' 
Came through drippin' 
Came through drippin' 
Came through drippin' 
Diamonds on my wrist, they drippin' 

[Verse 1: Cardi B]
Look, I just want to break up all your shit, call your mama phone
Let her know that she raised a bitch, then dial tone, click
And fuck your little fake ass friends
Come around actin' like they my bros
I seen y'all little group texts
Where you all like to brag about your hoes
And you can tell your little bitch
I screenshotted all her naked pics
Oh, you wanna send nudes to my man?
Wake up and see your boobs on the 'Gram?
Lil' bitch, I cannot stand you, right hand to Jesus
I might just cut all the tongues out your sneakers
Smash your TV from Best Buy
You gon' turn me into Left Eye
I don't wanna hear 'bout invasion of privacy
I had a feeling, it turns out you lie to me
I'm holdin' back everything that's inside of me
How you out fuckin' with bitches that follow me?

[Pre-Chorus: Ali Tamposi & Cardi B]
My heart is beating like it's bleeding out
You sleepin', you sleepin', you sleepin'
You sleeping like a baby
Everyone was right about you now, and
You creepin', you creepin', you creepin'

[Chorus: Ali Tamposi & Cardi B]
I went through your phone last night
I went through your phone last night
Saw some things I didn't like
I went through your phone last night
It's killin' me, killin' me, killin' me, oh

[Verse 2: Cardi B]
All I can see is you and her in different scenarios
Beyonc on my stereo, "Resentment" on repeat
I'ma make your bowl of cereal with a teaspoon of bleach
Serve it to you like, "Here you go, nigga, bon apptit"
Look, did you give it to her raw? You love her or nah?
You risk your whole home for a ho from the bar?
You really want them hoes? You can have them bitches
You don't even cheat with no badder bitches
This shit is eatin' me, you sleepin' peacefully
Gettin' more mad at you, thinkin' 'bout stabbin' you
Don't even know that you this close to dyin'
You gon' wake up like, "Why you got an attitude?"

[Pre-Chorus: Ali Tamposi & Cardi B]
My heart is beating like it's bleeding out
You sleepin', you sleepin', you sleepin'
You sleeping like a baby
Everyone was right about you now, and
You creepin', you creepin', you creepin'

[Chorus: Ali Tamposi & Cardi B]
I went through your phone last night

Saw some things I didn't like

[Intro: Kehlani]
Ooh, ooh
Ring, ring, ring, ring

[Chorus: Kehlani]
You don't hit my line no more, oh, oh
You don't make it ring, ring, ring, ring
I can't keep this on the low
I want you to make it ring, ring, ring, ring

[Verse 1: Cardi B]
Should I call first? I can't decide
I want to, but a bitch got pride
The switchin' up shit is what I can't fuck with
I'm feelin' you but you hard to get in touch with
And you ain't hit me up in a while
Actin' like you don't know what number to dial
You quit, then that's it, I'ma throw in the towel
'Cause a nigga only gon' do what you allow
You don't want this gun smoke
Learn to text with your nose if your thumb broke
I don't care if we get into it and I stall on your ass
Better still wake up to missed calls from your ass, nigga

[Chorus: Kehlani]
You don't hit my line no more, oh, oh
You don't make it ring, ring, ring, ring
I can't keep this on the low
I want you to make it ring, ring, ring, ring

[Verse 2: Cardi B]
Nah, nigga now you gon' have to call me 
'Cause I'm lookin' at these messages, they on me 
Actin' like they ain't niggas that want me
Let another nigga in your spot, and you gon' be hot nigga, coffee
You gon' be sick to your, stomach
Hit me when you free, 1-800
It's emergency, call me 911
Cause right now I'm out here tryna find someone
The ring on my phone, ring on my finger 
You actin' like you ain't tryna do either 
Once a good girl, watch me turn diva
Here goes my heart, I put it on speaker 

[Chorus: Kehlani]
You don't hit my line no more, oh, oh
You don't make it ring, ring, ring, ring
I can't keep this on the low
I want you to make it ring, ring, ring, ring

[Bridge: Kehlani]
You used to be on my line
On my tick all the time, yeah
Love it when you make me feel
Like you don't mind when I ain't got time for you
And no it don't go to my head, I'm only arrogant in bed
I just love to know you wanna spend time with me instead
Now you all caught up, yeah
You all caught up and you done left me alone, yeah
You was all fed up
Ready for the next step, wanna be on your own
Said I just miss you, I just miss us, baby
All I know is

[Chorus: Kehlani]
You don't hit my line no more, oh, oh
You don't make it ring, ring, ring, ring 
I can't keep this on the low 
I want you to make it ring, ring, ring, ring

[Verse]
Look, they gave a bitch two options: strippin' or lose
Used to dance in a club right across from my school
I said "dance" not "fuck", don't get it confused
Had to set the record straight 'cause bitches love to assume
Mama couldn't give it to me, had to get it at Sue's
Lord only knows how I got in those shoes
I was covered in dollars, now I'm drippin' in jewels
A bitch play with my money? Might as well spit in my food
Bitches hated my guts, now they swear we was cool
Went from makin' tuna sandwiches to makin' the news
I started speakin' my mind and tripled my views
Real bitch, only thing fake is the boobs
Get money, go hard, you're mothafuckin' right
Never been a fraud in my mothafuckin' life
Get money, go hard, damn fuckin' right
Stunting on these bitches out of mothafuckin' spite
Ain't no runnin' up on me, went from nothin' to glory
I ain't tellin' y'all to do it, I'm just tellin' my story
I don't hang with these bitches 'cause these bitches be corny
And I got enough bras, y'all ain't gotta support me
I went from rag to riches, went from WIC to lit, nigga
Only person in my fam to see six figures
The pressure on your shoulders feel like boulders
When you gotta make sure that everybody straight
Bitches stab you in your back while they smilin' in your face
Talking crazy on your name, trying not to catch a case
I waited my whole life just to shit on niggas
Climbed to the top floor so I can spit on niggas
Said "I was just tryna chill and make bangers" 
Tell all these old bitches they in danger 
The thing on my hip whip bitches into shape 
That's what I call a fuckin' waist trainer
You gon' run up on who and do what? 
I think y'all got your story screwed up 
I came here to ball, is you nuts?
I don't want your punk-ass man, I'm too tough 
I'm the one that's killin' shit, hands down 
If you got a problem with me, say it now 
'Cause I don't wanna hear no sneak dissin' 
'Specially not from one you weak bitches
I'm on go like I don't see no stop lights 
I'm steppin' out every day, prom night 
So if it's all love, show me love then 
'Cause you hatin' on a bitch, that's what it sounds like
Beast mode, that's how I give it up, nigga
Hoodie, low, that's how I'm pullin' up
Just 'cause I been on the road don't mean I been on the run
And you gon' have to learn to hold your tongue or hold the gun 
And we all know you ain't that type 
I smack you and the bitch that you act like 
I started gettin' money, bitches upset 
They remind me of my pussy, bitches mad tight
Nails done, hair laid, keep 'em both laced 
Co-come through shinin' with a Rollie bust face 
He-headshot, headshot, tell 'em closed case
Ain't no bitch spittin' like this since '08
I don't trust no nigga, I don't fear no bitch 
Whole life been through some fucked up shit 
They say I'm too that, oh, I'm too this
When you see what I've seen, you end up like this 
I walked into the label, "Where the check at?" 
Cardi B on the charts, ain't expect that
Where that bitch that was claimin' she a threat? 
I'ma put a Louboutin where her neck at
They say I'm too ratchet, they say I act wild 
I'm tryna whip the foreign like a bad ass child 
They caught me slippin' once, tell 'em try that now 
Cardi B, know it's me, hear that "blap" sound 

[Chorus]
Man, I said we gon' win
Knock me down nine times but I get up ten
Look myself in the mirror, I say we gon' win
Knock me down nine times but I get up ten
Look myself in the mirror, I say we gon' win
Knock me down nine times but I get up ten
Yeah, but I get up ten
Knock me down nine times but I get up ten, bitch 

[Bridge]
I'ma make a fuck nigga feel me 
Said I'ma do a broke bitch filthy 
I'ma make a fuck nigga feel me 
Said I'ma do a broke bitch filthy 

[Chorus]
We gon' win
Knock me down nine times but I get up ten 
Yeah, I said we gon' win
Knock me down nine times but I get up ten, bitch 

[Intro: Chance The Rapper]
I'm livin' my best life, yeah, yeah
I'm livin' my best life
Made a couple M's, you know 

[Chorus: Chance The Rapper]
Said I'm livin' my best life
Said I'm livin' my best life
Made a couple M's with my best friends
Turned all my L's into lessons
You see the whip pullin' up, it's like "skrrt"
Dreams pullin' up, I'm like "skrrt"
I'm livin' my best life
It's my birthday, at least that's what I'm dressed like

[Verse 1: Cardi B]
I'm like Big Pop' mixed with 2Pac, I'm like Makaveli 
You need some, Little Caesar's pizza, I be hot and ready 
Nigga, you a pussy and a rat, you like Tom and Jerry
Nigga, you ain't ballin', you just talkin', that's that commentary 
I was in the field, man, I slaved for this 
Had to talk to God, dropped down, and prayed for this
To my surprise, He replied, said, "You made for this"
I seen the car I wanted, then I went and paid for it, cash cash
Hit the Tay-K, I hit the race, hit the dash dash
That's when they came for me on Twitter with the backlash
"#CardiBIsSoProblematic" is the hashtag
I can't believe they wanna see me lose that bad
They talkin' junk and they stink, these hoes mad trash
I'm gigglin', can't let the devil have the last laugh
Ain't no more beefin', I'm just keepin' to myself
I'm my own competition, I'm competin' with myself 

[Chorus: Chance The Rapper]
I told y'all, I'm livin' my best life 
I told y'all, I said I'm livin' my best life 
I made a couple M's with my best friends
Turned all my L's into lessons 
You see the whip pullin' up, it's like "skrrt" 
Dreams pullin' up, it's like "skrrt" 
I'm livin' my best life
It's my birthday, at least that's what I'm dressed like 

[Verse 2: Chance The Rapper]
You don't like money, I can see it your eye
You don't like winnin', I can see it in your tie
Better be careful with these women when you trickin', send it fly 
She count money in her sleep and she don't ever spend the night
But she trappin' and she had to make it happen for her life
Don't be mad because she havin', shit, you had it your whole life
We had baggage on our flight, we had badges on our asses
You got passes in your life, you had gadgets on your bike
God work magic, God work magic, God work magic in my life 
And that guala like Iyanla 'cause that bag just fixed my life 
And y'all know good and damn well I don't want no champagne 
But can we please get some more champagne? 
Please, no Andre, G like 'Venchy
Reach like 'Bron James, pep talk from Yonc
'Member my hands had ash like Pompeii
Now they hold cash, won't peak like Dante

[Chorus: Chance The Rapper]
I told y'all, I said I'm livin' my best life
I told y'all, I said I'm livin' my best life 
I made a couple M's with my best friends
Turned all my L's into lessons 
You see the whip pullin' up, it's like "skrrt" 
Dreams fillin' up, I'm like "skrrt" 
I'm livin' my best life
It's my birthday, at least that's what I'm dressed like

[Verse 3: Cardi B]
I said I never had a problem showin' y'all the real me
Hair when it's fucked up, crib when it's filthy
Way-before-the-deal me, strip-to-pay-the-bills me
'Fore I fixed my teeth, man, those comments used to kill me
But never did I change, never been ashamed
Never did I switch, story stayed the same
I did this on my own, I made this a lane
Y'all gotta bear with me, I been through some things
Went from small-ass apartments to walkin' red carpets
Pissy elevators, now every dress is tailored
This some real-life fairy tale Binderella shit
I got further than them hoes said I will ever get
And that only goes to show that only God knows
I took pictures with Beyonc, I met Mama Knowles
I'm the rose that came from the concrete and arose
I'm like gold, I'm life goals, man, I'm chosen, I'm floatin', ayy

[Chorus: Chance The Rapper]
I told y'all, I said I'm livin' my best life
I told y'all, I said I'm livin' my best life 
I made a couple M's with my best friends
Turned all my L's into lessons 
You see the whip pullin' up, it's like "skrrt" 
Dreams pullin' up, I'm like "skrrt" 
I'm livin' my best life
It's my birthday, at least that's what I'm dressed like

[Outro: Chance The Rapper]
Skrrt skrrt, it's goin' down right now

[Verse 1]
Now, I said luxury apartments 
I'm young and I'm heartless 
There's a bitch that aint my bitch then that bitch is a target 
Lawyer is a Jew, he gon' chew up all the charges
Don't matter if you fuck with me, I get money regardless 

[Chorus]
That guap, guap, get some chicken

Guap, guap, get some chicken

[Verse 2]
Now I said, hoes down, Gs up 
You know how I'm rockin', but my watch is freezed up 
I can't wait until they drop that Lamborghini truck 
I'm careful where I park it, hoes will have it keyed up
Them bitches getting beat up 
Slim waist, ass fat , my shit is caked up
My bad bitch at the bake , without no makeup
This that collard greens, cornbread, neck bone, back fat
Get it from my mama and you don't know where your daddy at
Knick-knack, paddywhack, give a dog a bone 
Put it on him, then your nigga never comin' home 
I'ma flex like a 'roid, I'm a ten, she a 'droid
Stupid ho, unimportant, unattractive, unemployed

You make-believe 
Now with me it's only facts 
Expensive weave, and my checks is worth some racks, uh

[Verse 3]
Yeah, pop that pussy like you ain't popped that pussy in a while
Pop that pussy like poppin' pussy is goin' out of style
Pop that pussy while you work, pop that pussy up at church
Pop that pussy on the pole, pop that pussy on the stove
Make that pussy slip and slide, like you from the 305
Put your tongue out in the mirror, pop that pussy while you drive
Spread them asscheeks open, make that pussy crack a smile
Lock your legs 'round that nigga, make him give your ass a child 
Gimme some neck, gimme a check
Pussy so good, make a nigga invest
Get a little spit, I'm gettin' it wet
I'll get it back up, just give me a sec'
Give him some vag', I'm gettin' a bag
Give him some ass, I'm gettin' some Raf
When I'm done, I make him cum, but then he comin' off that cash

[Chorus]
Get you some guap, guap, get some chicken
Guap, guap, get some bread

Guap, guap, get some bread

He make sure he put Cardi down on his grocery list
Now why this bitch tryna look on my Snap?

Got lips like Angelina, Bentley truck tangerine, unh
Tramps jumpin' on my dick, that's why they call it trampoline, uh

These bitches salty, they sodium, they jelly, petroleum
Always talkin' in the background, don't never come to the podium
Chef Cardi B, I'm cookin' up, I see you hoes at the stove again
While you hoes were sleepin' on me, I made 40 bands by 4pm
They be taking shots, miss miss, X and O, kiss kiss
Everythin' your nigga want, I'm like a walkin' wishlist
I don't understand what this hate is about
How you gon' suck yo' man dick with my name in yo' mouth?

Like come outside lil' bitch come outside
Never by my lonely got my niggas by my side
And all my niggas skrr skrr yeah they down to ride
Yeah my bitches go to work I'm talking 9 to 5
The streets want to fuck around you won't stay alive
Your man can cross you and I make sure that you pay the price
So don't be lacking when you coming home from work at night
You run your mouth I poppin out now it's on sight
You gon' be just like my pussy hella tight
A hoe can hate but don't be fucking with my commas
And if she is I'll shape her up and she gon' get the line up
Can't be starting all these problems if you cannot solve em
Cardi backing down I swear to God that's not an option

[Chorus]
Ran down on that bitch twice
Ran down on that bitch twice

If a bitch beef with me we gon' beef foreva
Ran down on that bitch twice

[Verse 2]
Some bitches claim they with the shits but they ain't with a thing
I spin the block come around like a boomerang
Silence silence I don't hear a thing
Worry about me but your pussy smell like turtle tank
I pull up on that check nothing less that's all I do
10 bands 50 bands ain't nothing new
I see some people who still worried about my revenue
I'm eating good you wish you could don't worry about my food
And niggas hating on a female ain't no way to live
You bitch made make me wonder if you got a dick
How you feeling like a man envying a chick
Wake up and go get some money go and find your niche
Silly muthafucka who raised you
A nigga with a pussy how disgraceful
I have my hittas come and duck tape you
And your bitch could get it too double date boo
So let's get it so let's get it so let's get it let's not waste a minute
You clearly started so let's finish
I don't do forgiveness, they take your kindness for a gimmick
I'm just here for business
I'm running down and I'm with it

[Chorus]
Ran down on that bitch twice

[Intro]
Uh, yeah
Some regular degular, bloody bars

[Verse]
I swear to God, they ain't wanna see me leave the club
Got up on my shit and now they scared to show me love
They'd rather see me on the pole twerkin' it for dubs
I guess I really gotta show them what the fuck is up
I'm on some other shit, that Cardi B gutta shit
Every time I catch a hating bitch, she on her stutter shit
Can't finish her words but on Instagram thuggin' shit
You set yourself up, don't make it seem like I be buggin', bitch
And niggas hatin' on me, really be upset
I don't know, make me wonder what you got between your legs
You a real nigga mad at a bitch for getting bread?
You's a bitch from birth, you just grew a third leg, woo!
Bite down, bite down, it was crunch time
Yeah I skip all of them bitches in the lunch line
I put in work, now I'm here at the front line
Ready for the bullshit, I swear it's on my bloodline
Touch mine, getting slumped, slimed one time
Pump blind, bitches quick, then I dump mine
Pull up with the Gucci clutch, spitting clutch rhymes
Flyer than a big big B with a Blood tie
Don't do much, he get hard when I bust wines
No straws for this juice box, gulp one time
Last nigga I was with went insane
'Cause my head game over hills like I'm lookin' for the sunshine
I'm a Bronx bitch birthed from the hip-hop
From the block to the tick tock in the Patek watch
Quick drop with the cash, couldn't fit the Ziploc
Grips locked, get your shit popped in my flip flops
Wealthy now, but every dollar, I still want it all
Now he wanna nail me, I could give your man a cure
You gotta mail me, but I don't check my spam at all
Never feel what you're sayin' like I'm usin' Anbesol
Travel all around the states getting nice checks
I was tourin' off a tape, I had a hype set
Is that the reason all these niggas wanna pipe next?
I'm a creep, bitch, see his dick through his Nike Tech
Got 'em all scared, I ain't even strike yet
Wire up jaws when I swing if the mic stretch
I worked hard, took the right steps, had a shot
So I took the shit, now this game gon' need a life vest

[Outro]
Uh

Huh

[Intro]

Cardi 
Cardi 
Woah

[Chorus]
Lookin' like I caught a lick
Run up on me, you get hit
And all my bitches with the shits
Bronx, New York, gangsta bitch
Lookin' like I caught a lick
Since Day 1, I've been that bitch
Got some hittas in my clique
Lookin' like I caught a lick
Lookin' like I caught a lick

[Verse 1]
Look at me, look at me
They ain't like me before, now they bookin' me
The glow got bitches so shook at me
They like, "Chef Cardi B, what you cookin' B?"
I say, "Bitches, got me on some new shit"
I swear niggas got me feelin' ruthless
Too much mo'fuckers done doubted me
That's why I had to just prove it
I remember walkin' in the stores, I couldn't buy nothin'
They look at me starin'
Now I just walk in the stores, I like it I cop it
I don't even think
Bank tellers asking for info
'Cause now my deposits on Kimbo
Told that bitch, "Gimme my money
Why the fuck you askin' all this info?"

[Pre-Chorus]
Run up, get done up
Got shooters ready for a come up
Promise you I didn't luck up
Was grindin' all night
Didn't sleep 'til the sun up
Now I got up on my shit
Walk around like I'm that bitch
Every nigga wanna hit

[Chorus]
Lookin' like I caught a lick
Run up on me, you get hit
And all my bitches with the shits
Bronx, New York, gangsta bitch
Lookin' like I caught a lick
Since Day 1, I've been that bitch
Got some hittas in my clique
Lookin' like I caught a lick
Lookin' like I caught a lick

[Verse 2]
See me in my 'bach, now they all surprised
Now they call my phone, I just press decline
Not even six seconds, I don't give 'em Vine
Tell 'em, "Fall back," all must recline
Bitches mad as fuck but I don't give a fuck
Niggas can't believe it, better soak it up
Lookin' like I caught a lick, bitch
Your nigga got me on his wishlist
Thought I was makin' no moves?
Thought I was gon' be livin' in Sues?
Thought I was makin' no money?
You fuckin' thought I was gon' lose
Everythin' I did, I swear I got paid
Been 'bout my money, that ain't gon' change
Bitch, you gon' drown tryna ride on my wave
Corny ass bitches, I just can't relate

[Pre-Chorus]
Run up, get done up
Got shooters ready for a come up
Promise you I didn't luck up
Was grindin' all night
Didn't sleep 'til the sun up
Now I got up on my shit
Walk around like I'm that bitch
Every nigga wanna hit

[Chorus]
Lookin' like I caught a lick
Run up on me, you get hit
And all my bitches with the shits
Bronx, New York, gangsta bitch
Lookin' like I caught a lick
Since Day 1, I've been that bitch
Got some hittas in my clique
Lookin' like I caught a lick
Lookin' like I caught a lick

KSR 
Hah, it's Cardi, ayy
Said, "I'm the shit, they can't fuck with me if they wanted to"
Umm...

[Coro: Cardi B]
Said, "Lil bitch, you can't fuck with me ni aunque t quieras"
That's a fact, Cardi B y de el trap soy la mam
Hit the store y compro todo lo que quiera comprar
I'm a boss, you a worker, yo alante y t atrs

Si me ves no me saludes, t y yo no somos amigas
Si t no haces dinero t no eres de las mas

[Verso 1: Cardi B]
Dique que t puedes contra mi? Vamo' a averiguar
Vamo' all, soy rapera y tambin yo s pelear
You in the club, t chapeando, yo llegando y cobrando
Siempre estoy depositando, 'tan cansao' de m en el banco
En verdad, no me importa a quien yo le caiga mal
Llevo dos mixtapes en seis meses, nadie me puede parar
I don't bother with these hoes, don't let these hoes bother me
All these bitches son mis hijas, to'as se copian de m
Mira, yo me robo a tu novioooh, hago coro con tu esposo
Tu jevo 'ta aficia'o, s que lo tengo sabroso
Yo se lo pongo en el paso, I'm like, "Okay"
Yo le pido lo que quiera, l me compra mi cartera y una jeepeta
Lo tengo tan aficia'o que hasta me paga mi renta
Soy la ms dura en la calle, know you prolly heard of me
Me busca, me arregl los dientes, hope you hoes know it ain't cheap
Pago la renta de mi madre y no dependo de nadie
Si no hablas de dinero es mejor que ni me hables

[Coro: Cardi B]
Said, "Lil bitch, you can't fuck with me ni aunque t quieras"
That's a fact, Cardi B y de el trap soy la mam

[Verso 2: Messiah El Artista]
Dique que t puedes contra mi? Suelta eso, bi
Nigga, please, to mis show son pago, ninguno gratis
Creme a m, no hagas que yo coja aqu un felony
I'm the big beef for well, these niggas know my pedigree
Honestly, I got bad bitches that wanna fuck with me
Suck on me, ride me crazy y dejarme seco a m
Que yo no 'taba sonando, que no 'taba haciendo bulla
Dique que estaba apagao y pegao con la jeva tuya
Ando con mi primo Lucas, un corito sano y con par de putas
Lo que tu gasta' una noche en botellas, eso yo lo gasto en refilles de hookah
Los cueros dicen: "Messiah 'ta de pinga, porque nos da y despus se embala"
A lo mejor ella pensaba que yo iba a darle y despus mudarla
Andamo' en la calle, o sea en la lleca
Andamo' fumando peyote, purple haze en mi yerba
Hablan mierda a tu espalda y cuando te ven ellos no dicen na'
Ando con mi hermano DJ Hova and tonight we gonna shake the block

[Coro: Cardi B]
Said, "Lil bitch, you can't fuck with me ni aunque t quieras"
That's a fact, Cardi B y de el trap soy la mam
Hit the store y compro todo lo que quiera comprar

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
Fleek the definition of me

[Chorus]

I gave you more than I give myself
So loyal to you that I betray myself

I guess my all just wasn't enough
Yeah there's something about you I can't help it
But Ima do for myself I'm being selfish

[Verse 2: Josh X]
Babe your melody is the voice I need makes me skip a beat yeah
And baby you know it yeah
But it's hard to show it
See the one I love used to be in clubs used to fuck with thugs yeah
And I can't expose it yeah cause she already know it yeah
But why don't you ask me
Why is it so hard to fall in love
Why don't you ask me
Why can I never ever ever try
Why don't you ask me
Why everything is going this way
Why don't you ask me
I guess we don't know
They say the one that you truly love hurts you the most
Now the one that I truly love hurt me the most
Now the one that you truly love is hurting you the most
I guess I'll never know
Why I got so cold
It's not your fault

[Outro: Cardi B & Josh X]
Be selfish, be selfish, be selfish Withering away as I gaze at the sky looking at his face and all the pain it's caused me
I ask why
Didn't I love
Didn't I give you more than I ever gave myself
What do you wish cause that part of me no longer exist
This time I'm first, I'm picking me
I finally learned to be selfish

[Verse 1]
The nerve of you bitches
Like, oh my God, I got no words for you bitches
Like, who's really serving you bitches?
I need some answers, I'm worried for bitches
Like, this really absurd
No wonder these niggas stay curving you bitches
Don't even take no more selfies
That weave don't even deserve any pictures
Like, where did you buy that shit?
Who really acknowledged it?
What made you feel that you would be lit if you went and copped that shit?
They tell you ya look good?
Wasn't you iffy?
Oh, I know, they tell you that you get two bundles for fifty
Girl, you ain't low

Cheap shoes is okay, cheap dress is okay, but cheap weave is a "no"
Don'tcha do it to yourself that's bad for your health
Don't fuck up your flow
Talk shit about me with ya dusty ass weave?
Now you outta control

Got me on my hitman shit like brrap-brrap-brrap-brrap-brrap-brrap-brrap
I'm fully reloaded, full clip
I cut to the chase, snip-snip
That weave gotta go, pink slip
Looking washed up, drip-drip

[Pre-Chorus]
I can't believe it
This is insane
How can you talk about me when your weave is inside of the grave?

I can't believe it
Or is it just me?
But why all these bitches just walking the streets with some cheap ass weave

[Chorus]
Cheap ass weave
Cheap ass weave
How everything on fleek when you got some cheap ass weave?
Cheap ass weave

Don't even step to me if you got some cheap ass weave

[Verse 2]
So check yourself before you come at me

I am a masterpiece, you are a tragedy
Finish you like Mortal Kombat; fatality
I got shit jumping like What a Time...

That weave you got should be a crime
You got no luck, man
And how you niggas even let them in the crib with that?
You know that weave stink, that shit need a Tic Tac
Now you tell me you pulling hair off your pillows, hair off the sheets, and even hair out your asscrack
So cheap weave is okay? I think I missed that
I see a track showing, you need to fix that
You got a braid loose, you need to twist that
You got it fucked up, I would never pick that
Lady Leshurr done told y'all to go brush your teeth
But after you done, you leave the crib with that cheap ass weave?
I'm begging Lord, oh God, oh God, oh please, oh please

[Chorus: Cardi B & Kodak Black]
Said lil' bitch, you can't fuck with me if you wanted to 
These expensive, these is red bottoms, these is bloody shoes

Hit the store, I can get 'em both, I don't wanna choose 
And I'm quick, cut a nigga off, so don't get comfortable, look 
I don't dance now, I make money moves 
Said I don't gotta dance, I make money moves, 
If I see you and I don't speak, that means I don't fuck with you 
I'm a boss, you a worker, bitch, I make bloody moves 

[Verse: Kodak Black]
I ain't worried 'bout her, that's an old ho
You thought I was comin' with my old flow
Kodak ain't com to take no photo
I don't even pull up in a four door
I just hit a lick, hit the load though
All my life smokin' on JoJo
He was just posted up with dough though
Now he gettin' slammed by the popo
Thuggish, buggish, ruggish shit
I can't leave the streets, I love this shit
Never gave a shit 'bout a messy bitch
I ain't never take a risk for a petty lick
I'm at Digital Heights and I'm goin' on a heist
Dead presidents, John Kennedy
Dead presidents, pockets Mount Everest
When I step on the scene it's a felony 
Christian Louboutin 
These ain't Louis Vuittons 
Hit a Kodak Bop on nae nae
I wanna top me a Nae Nae
Now I'm in a white whip, no mayonnaise
Stole a new car for me, Audi A8
Cardi B brought the beat, told me re-rock the heat
Try me, I'll do the race like I'm Tay-K
It ain't no flockin' over here, lil' buddy
All of us zombies over here, lil' buddy
All of us robbin' 'cause they love your money
Got our own money, but we love your money
Crack a nigga's head wide open like a pumpkin
Jaguar F-Type orange like a pumpkin
Young nigga, I got old hundreds
Smokin' K2 with my bunkie 

[Chorus: Cardi B]
Lil' bitch, you can't fuck with me if you wanted to 
These expensive, these is red bottoms, these is bloody shoes 
Hit the store, I can get 'em both, I don't wanna choose
And I'm quick, cut a nigga off, so don't get comfortable, look 
I don't dance now, I make money moves 
Said I don't gotta dance, I make money moves 
If I see you and I don't speak, that means I don't fuck with you
I'm a boss, you a worker, bitch, I make bloody moves 

[Chorus]
I don't really trust them no more
All these bitches do is talk behind your back that's a no go
And I don't really stress it no more
Getting all this money made my heart so cold
Middle finger up to you hoes
Hating on me I'm making moves on the road though
And I don't really trust them no more

[Chorus]
I don't really trust them no more
All these bitches do is talk behind your back that's a no go
And I don't really stress it no more
Getting all this money made my heart so cold

And I don't really trust them no more

[Chorus]

Pop a pill I abort niggas 
And I don't save them I export niggas

Always talking about you run that block nigga really what block
Always talking about your shooters ha, so who y'all shot?
Always talking about your foreign whips nigga, really what lot?
Always talking about y'all niggas scam okay you scam

[Chorus]

Always emotional blinging my line go find Nemo and nigga get lost
Cannot talk spicy cause you are not hot

You bought me a chain, a ring, and a watch but how much it cost

[Chorus]
I dont do no sauce niggas 
Pop a pill I abort niggas 
And I don't save them I export niggas 
You niggas ass salad tossed niggas

Sittin' in that 6, frostbite, feelin' hella lit

[Intro]
I'm your...

[Verse 1]
Yo, I'm Cardi B with the wicked flow
Ask them, I keep them niggas on their tippy toes
Nick-nack-paddy-wack, give a dog a bone
Got him runnin' home, fuck him good, get that money flow
Pussy got him goin' places he would never go
Pussy got him cookin', now he wanna clean the stove
Pussy got him fucked up, I think he overdosed
But I ain't Travis Scott, I ain't got no antidote
Antidote, antidote

[Hook]
I think I like that
I think I like that
I think I like that
I think I like that

[Verse 2]
Yo, some people know me as a stripper hoe
But stripper hoes get the money and blow digits though
A lot of bitches talkin' down on me like I'm a joke
Talk shit, I'll fuck your man, send him back hella broke
I'm laughin', but I really mean it though
I'm on another level like I'm playin' Mario
These bitches can't see me, even with a telescope
Every day I'm shittin' on 'em, I don't flush the toilet bowl
Ew! Cause I be workin' and workin'
All these heads I be turnin', they on my body like surgeons
I think they see my conversion
That's why they be lurkin', but their feelings be hurtin'
Or remember when I wanna dance at certain clubs
And they told me, "No, no, that's a dub"
Now they the same niggas blowin' up my phone
Wantin' me to host, oh word? That's a dub
Bands

[Hook]
I think I like that

I think I like that
I think I like that

I think I like that

[Verse 3]
When I come up in the building I initiate
I'm the reason why the fuckers gotta renovate
I'm eatin' good and they mad they can't get a plate
Never thought we'd be gettin' booked in different states
Before the century they didn't even look this way
Now they wanna eat my ass like a skirt steak
Got 'em sending gifts, it's not even my birthday
You niggas soft and I meant that in the worst way
Oh you bitches suckin' dick just to get a bag
You hustlin'-backwards ass bitch, you're doin' bad
It's pretty sad, you should be getting more than that
Suck a dick so you can pay your rent, couple months with that
I mention flow, keep it on the low, I tell you facts
When a nigga 'bout to cum, just throw it back
It's over, you won, that nigga trapped
And that bank account, girl? Empty that

[Intro]
Oh, how you doin'?
I'm alright
Hahaha

[Verse]
Now how much times do I gotta prove these niggas wrong?
And how much times I gotta show these bitches I ain't soft?
How many shows I gotta sell out 'fore you get the cost?
Why they really tryna front like I ain't hit the charts?
All these labels, throwin' deals from left to right
But I ain't givin' in until they get them numbers right
All these people think that this shit happen overnight
All that flexin' they be doin', shit is all a hype
No tolerance for a hatin' bitch talkin' shit
Only time I hold my tongue is when I'm suckin' dick
So when I see you in the streets, yeah, it's fuckin' lit
And don't be talkin' all that sorry shit, don't flip the script
I see the lights, I hear the hype, I hit the mic
I kill the show, I get my dough, I catch a flight
I see a hater, I'm runnin' down, it's on sight
I throw my hands, I hit em' left, I hit em' right
They sleepin' on me just because I used to strip
But it's all good 'cause now they wanna get up in my VIP
Blowin' up my phone, sayin' everythin' I touch is lit
Actin' corn and wanna fuck me like they wasn't talkin' shit, woah
I let 'em live, let the shady motherfuckers live
Get them the price then it's time to show them what it is
Don't got the bat? Well then what you really tryna pitch?
Don't waste my time, I ain't never been no average bitch
Not to mention, I did my tour and that shit was winnin'
Independent, the headline, award of feelin'
I thank the Lord for all the blessings that he is given
I love the fans, they fill me up with their ammunition
I don't really talk shit but now I gotta off this
I don't know why bitches think we work in the same office
Corny bitches tryna keep up? Look exhausted
Wave the white flag, girl, you might as well just forfeit
My ex told me I was never gon' be shit
Lookie, lookie now, lookie now, nigga I'm that bitch
What you thought? Yeah, you really lost, now you kinda sick
But I ain't never need a nigga, I was always on my shit, yeah
I used to stare at magazines on the train
Lookin' at these models like, "I gotta be this one day"
Fuck around, got myself a name, now I'm gettin' paid
Left the corny bitches in the grave, so they throwin' shade[Hook]
Hundred band, hundred band

Bitches mad at me cause I'm on my shit

My type of niggas will wife me! The type of niggas that like bitches that pop off and suck dick all day motherfuckin' long, bitch
Thanks to all my followers that always defended me, y'all like my god brothers and god sisters. I would dead jump in your fight, I would dead jump in your fight. Now what's poppin?

[Hook: Cardi B]
Who wanna pop off?
Who wanna start war?
They talkin' shit?
I'm takin' tops off
Jeans, off

Rings, off
Everythin', off

Jeans, off
Weaves, off
Rings, off
Everythin', off

[Verse 1: Cardi B]
I'm startin' to lose my patience, weak bitches hatin'
Bitches throwing subs like I won't kick your face in
Baby mama's mad 'cause I'm in first place, and
When it comes to you bitch, there's no conversation
I been to give it up grimy, I'm the Bronx bitch, I'm feisty
"Cardi why you feisty?" Shut up bitch, fight me
NY raised and so you know it's very likely
That when I hear some shit that I don't like, I get hype B
Who would wanna wife me? Your nigga wanna wife me
You think 'cause I'm a stripper hoe, that nigga won't think twice B?
Put this pussy on his face, rde that shit nicely
Set his ass up, then you really ain't gon' like me
So what you tryna do? You and you and you
I feel some type a way, a bitch finna get loose
Tell me what's the deal? I'm 'bout to start the hill
The wig is comin' off, shit 'bout to get real

[Hook: Cardi B]
Who wanna pop off?
Who wanna start war?
They talkin' shit?
I'm takin' tops off
Jeans, off
Weaves, off
Rings, off
Everythin', off
Who wanna pop off?
Who wanna start war?
They talkin' shit?
I'm takin' tops off
Jeans, off

Everythin', off

[Verse 2: Casanova]
Got beef with Cardi B? I'm poppin' off
Shit get hectic? I'ma drop it off
Oh you shinin'? Your chain and your watch is off
You was never with this shit, nigga, knock it off
Youse a pussy, and your whole block is soft
You caught feelings, could she ain't even drop you off
You thought that bag was gettin' you pussy, not at all
You was gettin' lied, you ain't know she made that call
To the dog's dinner, and they starvin'
I gotta feed all 'em
I'maget that nigga, you gon' get that bitch
What they thought switched 'cause we both got rich?
Nah, we on the same time
You got yours, I got mine
You got a problem, get in line
It's Cardi B, and 2 times

[Hook: Cardi B]
Who wanna pop off?

[Verse 3: Cardi B]
Shit, that bitch six three and she bodied
Superman calves, and her shoulder somethin' retarded
I ain't backin' down, Cardi got the heart regardless
You gon' have to knock me out if you think I'ma forfeit
Gang gang, squad up, and have my niggas all on it
Pay a couple niggas and they had you out in a coffin
And I put that on my life, I really don't do this often
But the way I'm feelin' now, like whatever, I'm on it
Have you laid out on the stretcher with your socks off
Had the pastor prayin', like, "Sorry for your, loss"
Throw dirt on my name, you better pop off
My name ring bells like Mayweather, box off
I'm Cardi B, east coast newest contender
5'3" lookin' good with the nails bananas
Freddy Kruger on these bitches, I cut their lights off
Should have read the memo, Cardi B pops off

[Intro]
Yeah baby, I like it like that
You gotta believe me when I tell you
I said I like it like that
You gotta believe me when I tell you
I said I like it like

[Verse 1: Cardi B]
Now I like dollars, I like diamonds, I like stuntin', I like shinin'
I like million dollar deals, where's my pen? Bitch I'm signin' 
I like those Balenciagas , the ones that look like socks
I like going to the jeweler, I put rocks all in my watch 
I like texts from my exes when they want a second chance 
I like proving niggas wrong, I do what they say I can't 
They call me Cardi Bardi, banging body, spicy mami, hot tamale
Hotter than a Somali, fur coat, Ferrari 
Hop out the stu', jump in the coupe 
Big Dipper on top of the roof
Flexing on bitches as hard as I can
Eating halal, driving the Lam'
Told that bitch I'm sorry though 
'Bout my coins like Mario 
Yeah, they call me Cardi B
I run this shit like cardio
Woo, Facts

[Chorus: Cardi B]
Diamond district in the jag 
Certified, you know I'm gang, gang, gang, gang 
Drop the top and blow the brains, woo 
Oh, he's so handsome, what's his name? Yeah 
Oh, I need the dollars, cha-ching 
Beat it up like piatas 
Tell the driver, close the curtains 
Bad bitch make you nervous 

[Verse 2: Kontra K]
Ich mag die Liebe, mag die Stille, mag den Hustle, den wir leben 
Hass' die Falschheit vieler Blender, aber lieb' Ganovenehre 
Ich mag Leute, die nicht quatschen, sondern lieber stille Wasser
Und statt Gold sammeln wie Inkas lieber 'ne Finca fr meinen Vater 
Meine Gang regiert den Plaza, alle meine Jungs sind on fuego
Was fr Hahn im Korb? Ich seh' maximal nur Calimeros
Gangster schweigen und genieen, also quatsch mir nicht, Pendejo
Denn ein Rckgrat ist mehr wert als die Taschen voll Dinero
Geld kommt, Geld geht, aber Familie bleibt
Der innere Kreis elitr und klein
Auch wenn der Teufel viele Gesichter zeigt
Gott sei Dank nicht meins 
Jeder testet, jeder redet, jeder schneidet sich ins Fleisch
Ich halt' meine Leute, halt' meine Ziele, meine Versprechen immer ein 
Courage ber Fame 
Und lieber Wlfe, die noch beien, als die Kter, die nur bell'n
Klasse ber Geld
Und lieber Loyalitt fr meine Gang als den Erfolg nur fr mich selbst 

[Chorus: Cardi B]
Diamond district in the jag 
Certified, you know I'm gang, gang, gang, gang 
Drop the top and blow the brains, woo 
Oh, he's so handsome, what's his name? Yeah 
Oh, I need the dollars, cha-ching 
Beat it up like piatas 
Tell the driver, close the curtains 
Bad bitch make you nervous 

[Verse 3: AK Ausserkontrolle]
Frher ist Papa zur Arbeit mit Tickets gefahr'n
Heute sitzt Papa im dickesten Wagen
Weil wir bizzy war'n, weil wir, weil wir bizzy war'n
Meine Devise ist klar, einhundert Riesen in bar
AK Syndicat, AK AK-Syndicat
Egal, ob Benza oder Siebener, wir fahr'n vor
Das ist gangster, unser Leben einfach hardcore
Tatort, fliehen vom Tatort
Tatort, fliehen vom Tatort
Mach' Kilo fr Kilo weg, salame, salame
Sie machen Minus jetzt, jealousi, jealousi
Wir sind Jungs, die immer mehr woll'n
Rolex am Gelenk, unsere Zeit ist wertvoll
Keine Hunderttausend-Euro-Schecks
Nein, nein, ich will alles bar, bar, bar
Meine Jungs und ich verkaufen Flex
Steig ein, doch ich will alles bar, bar, bar

[Chorus: Cardi B]
Diamond district in the jag 
Certified, you know I'm gang 
Drop the top and blow the brains, woo 
Oh, he's so handsome, what's his name? Yeah 

[Intro]
Gangsta !
Cardi !
B !

[Chorus]
This is how I do
I make a fool out these bitches
They be thinking they tough
This is how I do
I make these niggas spend their money
Then I show them no love
This is how I do
If the bag not involved
Then you know it's a dub
This is how I do
They ain't fuck with me before now I gotta stunt

[Verse 1]
Pull up like huh?
They looking like what?
Heads turn left and right, they wonder who's her?
Cardi B, duh
Bitch don't front
You on my Gram all day, don't play dumb
Came up from the slums
The dirty, dirty Bronx
Where niggas quick to clip your shit, no fair ones
You gotta keep a gun, but beef to me is fun
I never back down, been this way since day one

[Pre-Chorus]
They shit on me before, thought I was just a stupid hoe
They tight now, they realize they was sleeping on gold
Took me one year man, and now I'm doin' shows
Now they wanna take pics with me, hold on let me pose
Believe me, I easily can do a bitch greasy
I'll give it to you just how you like it girlll
Cardi B in full effect, couple bitches upset
Couple niggas wanna hit it and they can't so they stressed

[Chorus]
This is how I do
I make a fool out these bitches
They be thinking they tough
This is how I do
I make these niggas spend their money
Then I show them no love
This is how I do
If the bag not involved
Then you know it's a dub
This is how I do
They ain't fuck with me before now I gotta stunt

[Verse 2]
Cardi in tune, bitches make room
Test me? The gat goes CLICK, CLACK, BOOM
Gangsta Bitch, oooh, Volume 2
Cop somethin' mean, when it start you hear that VROOM
Pull up to your side, 30 deep right?
Stuntin' on my ex, he thirsty for a reply
Sick, sick, sick
Call my phone, it's CLICK
Had me fucked up when you was fucking with that bitch

[Pre-Chorus]
Making power moves
Goin' 50 on 'em
Same ones that played me
High-siddity on 'em
Back to back with it, goin' Drizzy on 'em
Now they tight, they gotta watch me make a milli on 'em

[Outro]
Ha-Ha !
Yo, yo, Remember, remember nigga when you told me that I was gonna work in that strip club Divas on 177th in the Bronx for the rest of my life? Well guess what nigga? Now i'm the fucking diva
Shit

[Verse 1: Luke]
Remember the words you told me
"Love me 'til the day I die"
Surrender my everything
'Cause you made me believe you're mine
Yeah, you used to call me baby
Now you're calling me by name
Takes one to know one, yeah
You beat me at my own damn game

[Pre-Chorus: Luke]
You push and you push and I'm pulling away
Pulling away from you
I give and I give and I give and you take
Give and you take

[Chorus: Luke & All]
Youngblood
Say you want me, say you want me out of your life

Say you want me, say you want me back in your life
So Im just a dead man crawling tonight
'Cause I need it, yeah, I need it all of the time
Yeah, ooh, ooh, ooh

[Verse 2: Luke]
Lately our conversations
End like it's the last goodbye
Then one of us gets too drunk
And calls about a hundred times
So, who you been calling baby?
Nobody could take my place
When youre looking at those strangers
Hope to God you see my face

[Chorus: Luke & All]
Youngblood
Say you want me, say you want me out of your life

And I'm just a dead man walking tonight

[Verse 1: Luke]
Some days, you're the only thing I know
Only thing that's burning when the nights grow cold
Can't look away, can't look away
Beg you to stay, beg you to stay, yeah
Sometimes, you're a stranger in my bed
Don't know if you love me or you want me dead
Push me away, push me away
Then beg me to stay, beg me to stay, yeah

[Pre-Chorus: Luke]
Call me in the morning to apologize
Every little lie gives me butterflies
Something in the way you're looking through my eyes
Don't know if I'm gonna make it out alive

[Chorus: Luke & All]
Fight so dirty, but you love so sweet
Talk so pretty, but your heart got teeth
Late night devil, put your hands on me
And never, never, never ever let go
Fight so dirty, but you love so sweet
Talk so pretty, but your heart got teeth
Late night devil, put your hands on me
And never, never, never ever let go

[Verse 2: Luke]
Some days, you're the best thing in my life
Sometimes when I look at you, I see my wife
Then you turn into somebody I don't know
And you push me away, push me away, yeah

[Pre-Chorus: Luke]
Call me in the morning to apologize
Every little lie gives me butterflies
Something in the way you're looking through my eyes
Don't know if I'm gonna make it out alive

[Chorus: Luke & All]
Fight so dirty, but you love so sweet
Talk so pretty, but your heart got teeth
Late night devil, put your hands on me
And never, never, never ever let go
Fight so dirty, but you love so sweet
Talk so pretty, but your heart got teeth
Late night devil, put your hands on me
And never, never, never ever let go

[Bridge: Luke]
Blood on my shirt, rose in my hand
You're looking at me like you don't know who I am
Blood on my shirt, heart in my hand
Still beating

[Chorus: Luke & All]
Fight so dirty, but you love so sweet
Talk so pretty, but your heart got teeth
Late night devil, put your hands on me
And never, never, never ever let go
Fight so dirty, but you love so sweet
Talk so pretty, but your heart got teeth
Late night devil, put your hands on me
And never, never, never ever let go

[Outro: All]
Teeth
Teeth
Teeth
Never, never, never ever let go

[Verse 1: Luke]
I saw you looking brand new overnight
And I caught you looking too, but you didn't look twice
You look happy, oh, mmm
You look happy, oh

[Pre Chorus: Luke & Calum]
Flashing back to New York City
Changing flights so you stay with me
Remember thinking that I got this right

[Chorus: Luke & Calum]
Now I wish we never met
'Cause you're too hard to forget
While I'm cleaning up your mess
I know he's taking off your dress
I know that you dont, but if I ask you if you love me
I hope you lie, lie, lie, lie, lie to me

[Verse 2: Luke]
It's 3 AM and the moonlights testing me 
If I can make it 'til dawn, then it wont be hard to see 
I aint happy, oh, mmm mmmmm
I ain't too happy, ohhh, mmm

[Pre Chorus: Luke & Calum]
Flashing back to New York City
Changing flights so you stay with me
Problem was, I thought I had this right

[Chorus: Luke & Calum]
Now I wish we never met
'Cause you're too hard to forget
While Im cleaning up your mess
I know hes taking off your dress
I know that you dont, but if I ask you if you love me
I hope you lie, lie, lie, lie, lie to me
Singing, lie, lie, lie, lie, lie
Li-li-lie, lie, lie, lie, lie
Lie, lie, lie, lie, lie
Li-li-lie, lie, lie, lie, lie
And I know that you dont, but if I ask you if you love me
I hope you lie, lie, lie, lie, lie to me

[Verse 1: Calum]
I love the light in your eyes and the dark in your heart
You love our permanent chase and the bite of our bark
We know we're classic together like Egyptian gold
We love us

[Pre-Chorus: Luke]
It don't matter, be combative or be sweet cherry pie
It don't matter just as long as I get all you tonight

[Chorus: Luke, Michael & Calum]
I can take you out, oh, oh
We can kill some time, stay home
Throw balloons, teddy bears and the chocolate eclairs away
Got nothing but love for you, fall more in love every day
Valentine, valentine

[Verse 2: Michael]
So deep, your DNA's being messed with my touch
Cant beat us
So real, fueling the fire until we combust
Cant touch us

[Pre-Chorus: Luke]
It dont matter be combative or be sweet cherry pie
It dont matter just as long as I get all you tonight

[Chorus: Luke, Michael & Calum]
I can take you out, oh, oh
We can kill some time, stay home
Throw balloons, teddy bears and the chocolate eclairs away
Got nothing but love for you, fall more in love every day
Valentine, valentine

[Bridge: Luke]
Full plate, dont wait, have your cake and eat it too
Full plate, dont wait, have your cake and eat it

[Chorus: Luke, Michael & Calum]
I can take you out, oh, oh
We can kill some time, stay home
Throw balloons, teddy bears and the chocolate eclairs away
Got nothing but love for you, fall more in love every day
Valentine, valentine
Valentine, valentine

[Verse 1: Luke]
Can't help but wondering if this
Is the last time that I'll see your face
Is it tears or just the fucking rain?
Wish I could say something
Something that doesn't sound insane
But lately, I don't trust my brain
You tell me I won't ever change
So I just say nothing

[Chorus: All]
And no matter where I go
I'm always gonna want you back
No matter how long you're gone
I'm always gonna want you back
I know you know
I will never get over you
No matter where I go
I'm always gonna want you back
Want you back

[Verse 2: Luke]
I remember the freckles on your back
And the way that I used to make you laugh
'Cause you know every morning I wake up
Yeah, I still reach for you
I remember the roses on your shirt
When you told me this would never work
You know, even when I say I moved on
Yeah, I still dream for you

[Chorus: All]
And no matter where I go
I'm always gonna want you back
No matter how long you're gone
I'm always gonna want you back
I know you know
I will never get over you
No matter where I go
I'm always gonna want you back
Want you back





[Bridge: Luke]
You know even when I say I moved on
You know even though I know that you're gone
All I think about is where I went wrong
You know even when I say I moved on
You know even though I know that you're gone
All I think about is where I went wrong
Yeah, I still dream for you
No matter where I go, I'm always gonna want you back

[Chorus: All]
No matter where I go
I'm always gonna want you back 
No matter how long you're gone
I'm always gonna want you back
I know you know
I will never get over you
No matter where I go
I'm always gonna want you back
Want you back

[Outro: All]
Always gonna want you back
Want you back
Always gonna want you back
Want you back

[Intro: Luke]
Is it easier to stay? Is it easier to go?
I don't wanna know, oh
But I know that I'm never, ever gonna change
And you know you don't want it any other way

[Verse 1: Luke]
Why do we always gotta run away?
And we wind up in the same place
It's like we're looking for the same thing
Same thing, yeah
Yeah, do we really gotta do this now?
Right here with all your friends around
In the morning, we can work it out
Work it out

[Pre-Chorus: Luke, with All]
I love you so much that I hate you
Right now, it's so hard to blame you
'Cause you're so damn beautiful
So damn beautiful

[Chorus: Luke, with All]
Is it easier to stay? Is it easier to go?
I don't wanna know, oh
But I know that I'm never, ever gonna change
And you know that you're always gonna stay the same
Is it easier to stay? Is it easier to go?
I don't wanna know, oh
But I know that I'm never, ever gonna change
And you know you don't want it any other way

[Verse 2: Luke]
Every time that you say you're gonna leave
That's when you get the very best of me
You know we need it like the air we breathe
Air we breathe, yeah

[Pre-Chorus: Luke, with All]
I love you so much that I hate you 
Right now, it's so hard to blame you 
'Cause you're so damn beautiful 
So damn beautiful 

[Chorus: Luke, with All]
Is it easier to stay? Is it easier to go?
I don't wanna know, oh
But I know that I'm never, ever gonna change
And you know that you're always gonna stay the same
Is it easier to stay? Is it easier to go?
I don't wanna know, oh 
But I know that I'm never, ever gonna change
And you know you don't want it any other way

[Bridge: Luke]
The hardest part of all 
Is that we're only built to fall 

[Chorus: Luke, with All]
Is it easier to stay? Is it easier to go?
I don't wanna know, oh 
But I know that I'm never, ever gonna change
And you know that you're always gonna stay the same 
Is it easier to stay? Is it easier to go? 
I don't wanna know, oh 
But I know that I'm never, ever gonna change
And you know you don't want it any other way

[Outro: All & Luke]
I love you so much that I hate you 
Right now, it's so hard to blame you
'Cause you're so damn beautiful

[Verse 1]
Angel, with the gun in your hand
Pointin' my direction, givin' me affection
Love is fatal, won'tyougive it achance?
Center of attention, don't you askme any questions

[Pre-Chorus]
Go on and light me like a cigarette
Even if it might be somethin' you'll regret
You got me now, now, now
Swallow me down, down, down, down

[Chorus]
I only light up when cameras are flashin'
Never enough and no satisfaction
Got no shame
I love the way you're screaming my name
Diggin' my grave to get a reaction
Changin' my face and callin' it fashion
Got no shame
I love the way you're screaming my name

[Verse 2]
Lay me in the palm of your hand
I'll give you my permission, you'll always be forgiven
Go on, replace me
When you're cravin' somethin' sweeter than the words I left in your mouth
Go on and spit me out

[Chorus]
I only light up when cameras are flashin'
Never enough and no satisfaction
Got no shame
I love the way you're screaming my name
Diggin' my grave to get a reaction
Changin' my face and callin' it fashion
Got no shame
I love the way you're screaming my name

[Post-Chorus]
I love the way you're screaming my name
I love the way you're screaming my name

[Bridge]
Go on and light me like a cigarette
Even if it might be somethin' you'll regret
You got me now, now, now
Swallow me down, down, down, down

[Chorus]
I only light up when cameras are flashin'
Never enough and no satisfaction
Got no shame
I love the way you're screaming my name
Diggin' my grave to get a reaction
Changin' my face and callin' it fashion
Got no shame
I love the way you're screaming my name

[Post-Chorus]
I love the way you're screaming my name
I love the way you're screaming my name

[Verse 1: Luke]
Here I am waking up, still can't sleep on your side
There's your coffee cup, the lipstick stain fades with time
If I can dream long enough, you'd tell me I'd be just fine
I'll be just fine

[Chorus: Luke]
So I drown it out like I always do
Dancing through our house with the ghost of you
And I chase it down, with a shot of truth
Dancing through our house with the ghost of you

[Verse 2: Calum]
Cleaning up today, found that old Zeppelin shirt
You wore when you ran away, and no one could feel your hurt
We're too young, too dumb, to know things like love
But I know better now, better now

[Chorus: Luke & All]
So I drown it out like I always do
Dancing through our house with the ghost of you
And I chase it down, with a shot of truth
Dancing through our house with the ghost of you

[Bridge: Calum]
Too young, too dumb
To know things like love
Too young, too dumb

[Chorus: Luke]
So I drown it out like I always do
Dancing through our house with the ghost of you
And I'll chase it down, with a shot of truth
That my feet don't dance like they did with you

[Verse 1: Calum]
I drove by all the places we used to hang out getting wasted
I thought about our last kiss, how it felt, the way you tasted
And even though your friends tell me you're doing fine
Are you somewhere feeling lonely even though hes right beside you?
When he says those words that hurt you
Do you read the ones I wrote you?

[Pre-Chorus: Calum]
Sometimes I start to wonder, was it just a lie?
If what we had was real, how could you be fine?
'Cause I'm not fine at all

[Chorus: All & Luke]
I remember the day you told me you were leaving
I remember the make-up running down your face
And the dreams you left behind, you didn't need them
Like every single wish we ever made
I wish that I could wake up with amnesia
And forget about the stupid little things
Like the way it felt to fall asleep next to you
And the memories I never can escape
'Cause I'm not fine at all

[Verse 2: Calum]
The pictures that you sent me, they're still living in my phone
I'll admit I like to see them, I'll admit I feel alone
And all my friends keep asking why I'm not around
It hurts to know youre happy, yeah, it hurts that you moved on
Its hard to hear your name when I haven't seen you in so long

[Pre-Chorus: Calum]
Its like we never happened, was it just a lie?
If what we had was real, how could you be fine?
'Cause I'm not fine at all

[Chorus: All & Luke]
I remember the day you told me you were leaving
I remember the make-up running down your face
And the dreams you left behind you didn't need them
Like every single wish we ever made
I wish that I could wake up with amnesia
And forget about the stupid little things
Like the way it felt to fall asleep next to you
And the memories I never can escape

[Bridge: Luke]
If today I woke up with you right beside me
Like all of this was just some twisted dream
I'd hold you closer than I ever did before
And you'd never slip away
And you'd never hear me say

[Chorus: All]
I remember the day you told me you were leaving
I remember the make-up running down your face
And the dreams you left behind you didn't need them
Like every single wish we ever made
I wish that I could wake up with amnesia
And forget about the stupid little things
Like the way it felt to fall asleep next to you
And the memories I never can escape

[Outro: Luke]
'Cause I'm not fine at all
No, I'm really not fine at all
Tell me this is just a dream
'Cause I'm really not fine at all

[Intro: Luke]
Thinking 'bout you lots lately
Have you been eating breakfast alone like me?
Thinking 'bout you lots lately

[Verse 1: Calum]
Is it bad that I'm hoping that you're broken?
Is it bad that I'm wishing you're still broken?
That you haven't found fish in the ocean
Is it bad? So bad
Is it weird that I'm drunk and on my sofa?
Is it weird that I'm naked on my sofa?
All alone, damn, I wish I didn't know ya
Is it weird? So weird

[Pre Chorus: Luke]
I know Im the stupid one who ended it
And now I'm the stupid one regretting it
It took me a couple drinks to admit it
I know Im the stupid one

[Chorus: All]
Thinking about you lots lately
Have you been eating breakfast alone like me?
Thinking about you lots lately
Or are you moving along?
Been thinking about you lots lately
Have you been feeling empty beds just like me?
I've been thinking about you lots, lately
Or are you moving along?

[Verse 2: Luke]
Is it wrong if I ask you to come over?
Is it wrong if I tell you that I love ya?
Even though I'd never do it when I'm sober
Is it wrong? So wrong

[Pre Chorus: Luke]
I know Im the stupid one who ended it
And now I'm the stupid one regretting it
It took me a couple drinks to admit it
I know Im the stupid one

[Chorus: All]
Thinking about you lots lately
Have you been eating breakfast alone like me?
Thinking about you lots lately
Or are you moving along?
Been thinking about you lots lately
Have you been feeling empty beds just like me?
I've been thinking about you lots lately
Or are you moving along?

[Bridge: Ashton & Luke]
Scared of moving on, but you're already gone
So if youre moving on, won't you just tell me
Scared of moving on, but youre already gone
So if youre moving on, won't you just tell me

[Chorus: All]
Thinking about you lots lately
Have you been eating breakfast alone like me?
Thinking about you lots lately
Or are you moving along?
Been thinking about you lots lately
Have you been feeling empty beds just like me?
I've been thinking about you lots lately
Or are you moving along?

[Outro: Michael & Luke]
Scared of moving on, but you're already gone
So if youre moving on
Are you moving along?

And I like its look, and I like its shape

[Intro: All]
Hey-hey, hey-hey, hey-hey, hey
Hey-hey, hey-hey, hey-hey, hey

[Verse 1: Luke]
Simmer down, simmer down
They say were too young now to amount to anything else
But look around
We worked too damn hard for this just to give it up now
If you dont swim, youll drown
But dont move, honey

[Chorus: All]
You look so perfect standing there
In my American Apparel underwear
And I know now that Im so down
Your lipstick stain is a work of art
I got your name tattooed in an arrow heart
And I know now that Im so down
Hey
Hey-hey, hey-hey, hey-hey, hey

[Verse 2: Calum]
Lets get out, lets get out
'Cause this deadbeat towns only here just to keep us down
While I was out
I found myself alone just thinking
If I showed up with a plane ticket
And a shiny diamond ring with your name on it
Would you wanna run away too?
'Cause all I really want is you

[Chorus: All]
You look so perfect standing there
In my American Apparel underwear
And I know now that Im so down
I made a mixtape straight out of 94
Ive got your ripped skinny jeans lying on the floor
And I know now that Im so down
Hey
Hey-hey, hey-hey, hey-hey, hey

[Bridge: Luke]
You look so perfect standing there
In my American Apparel underwear
And I know now that I'm so down
Your lipstick stain is a work of art
I got your name tattooed in an arrow heart
And I know now that Im so down

[Chorus: All]
Hey
Hey-hey, hey-hey, hey-hey, hey
You look so perfect standing there
In my American Apparel underwear
And I know now that Im so down 
Your lipstick stain is a work of art
I got your name tattooed in an arrow heart
And I know now that Im so down
Hey

[Verse 1: Luke]
They would yell, they would scream, they were fighting it out
She would hope, she would pray, she was waiting it out
Holding onto a dream
While she watches these walls fall down
Sharp words like knives, they were cutting her down
Shattered glass like the past, its a memory now
Holding onto a dream
While she watches these walls fall down

[Chorus: Calum]
Hey, mom, hey, dad
When did this end?
When did you lose your happiness?
I'm here alone inside of this broken home
Whos right? Whos wrong?
Who really cares?
The fault, the blame, the pains still there
I'm here alone inside of this broken home, this broken home

[Verse 2: Calum]
Wrote it down on the walls, she was screaming it out
Made it clear shes still here, are you listening now?
Just a ghost in the halls
Feeling empty, theyre vacant now
All the battles, all the wars, all the times that youve fought
Shes a scar, shes the bruises, shes the pain that you brought
There was life, there was love
Like a light and its fading out

[Chorus: Luke]
Hey, mom, hey, dad
When did this end?
When did you lose your happiness?
I'm here alone inside of this broken home
Whos right? Whos wrong?
Who really cares?
The fault, the blame, the pains still there
I'm here alone inside of this broken home, this broken home

[Bridge: Michael]
You've gotta let it go
Youre losing all your hope
Nothing left to hold
Locked out in the cold
Your pain and memories
They washed out all the scenes
I'm stuck in between
A nightmare and lost dreams

[Chorus: Michael & All & Calum]
Hey, mom, hey, dad
When did this end?
When did you lose your happiness?
I'm here alone inside of this broken home
Hey, mom, hey, dad
When did this end?
When did you lose your happiness?
I'm here alone inside of this broken home
Whos right? Whos wrong?
Who really cares?
The fault, the blame, the pains still there
I'm here alone inside of this broken home
This broken home

[Verse 1: Michael]
Everybody's got their demons
Even wide awake or dreaming
I'm the one who ends up leaving
Make it okay
See a war, I wanna fight it
See a match, I wanna strike it
Every fire I've ignited
Faded to grey

[Pre-Chorus: Michael]
But now that Im broken
Now that you know it
Caught up in a moment
Can you see inside?

[Chorus: Michael & All]
'Cause I've got a jet black heart
And there's a hurricane underneath it
Trying to keep us apart
I write with a poison pen
But these chemicals moving between us
Are the reason to start again

[Verse 2: Luke & ]
Now I'm holding on for dear life 
There's no way that we could rewind 
Maybe there's nothing after midnight
That could make you stay

[Pre-Chorus: Ashton & ]
But now that I'm broken 
And now that you know it 
Caught up in a moment
Can you see inside?

[Chorus: All]
'Cause I've got a jet black heart
And there's a hurricane underneath it
Trying to keep us apart
I write with a poison pen
But these chemicals moving between us
Are the reason to start again

[Bridge: Calum]
The blood in my veins is made up of mistakes
Let's forget who we are and dive into the dark
As we burst into color, returning to life

[Chorus: Michael & All]
'Cause I've got a jet black heart
And there's a hurricane underneath it
Trying to keep us apart
I write with a poison pen
But these chemicals moving between us
Are the reason to start again

[Outro: Calum & ]
The blood in my veins is made up of mistakes

Let's forget who we are and dive into the dark

[Verse 1: Calum]
I thought we had a place, just our place, our home base, my headspace
Was you and I always, but that phase has been phased in our place
I see it on your face, a small trace, a blank slate, we've been erased
But if we're way too faded to drive, you can stay one more night

[Chorus: Calum/All]
We said we'd both love harder than we knew we could go
But still the hardest part is knowing when to let go
You wanted to go higher, higher, higher
Burn too bright, now the fire's gone
Watch it all fall down: Babylon

[Post-Chorus: Calum]
Babylon
Burn too bright, now the fire's gone, watch it all fall down

[Verse 2: Calum]
I'm tired of the feud, your short fuse, my half-truths are not amused
I wish we had a clue to start new, a white moon, no residue
The color of our mood is so rude, a cold June, we're not immune
But if we're way too faded to fight, you can stay one more night

[Chorus: Calum/All]
We said we'd both love harder than we knew we could go
But still the hardest part is knowing when to let go
You wanted to go higher, higher, higher
Burn too bright, now the fire's gone
Watch it all fall down: Babylon

[Post-Chorus: Calum]
Babylon
Burn too bright, now the fire's gone, watch it all fall down

[Chorus: Calum & All]
We said we'd both love harder than we knew we could go
But still the hardest part is knowing when to let go
You wanted to go higher, higher, higher
Burn too bright, now the fire's gone, watch it all fall down
We said we'd both love harder than we knew we could go
But still the hardest part is knowing when to let go
You wanted to go higher, higher, higher
Burn too bright, now the fire's gone
Watch it all fall down: Babylon

[Post-Chorus: Calum]
Babylon
Burn too bright, now the fire's gone, watch it all fall down

[Verse 1: Luke]
Lover of mine, maybe we'll take some time
Kaleidoscope mind gets in the way
Hope and Ipray,darling, that youwill stay
Butterfly lies, chase them away,mmm

[Pre-Chorus: Luke & Calum]
Dance around the living room
Lose me in the sight of you
I've seen the red, I've seen the blue
Take all of me
Deep to where your secrets hide
Where we've been a thousand times
Swallow every single lie
Take all of me

[Chorus: Luke]
I'll never give you away
'Cause I already made that mistake
If my name never fell off your lips again
I know it'd be such a shame
When I take a look at my life and all of my crimes
You're the only thing that I think I got right
I'll never give you away
'Cause I already made, already made that mistake

[Verse 2: Luke, Luke & Calum]
Lover of mine, I know you're colourblind
I watched the world fall from your eyes, ooh
All my regrets and things you can't forget
Light them all up, kiss them goodbye

[Pre-Chorus: Luke & Calum]
Dance around the living room
Lose me in the sight of you
I've seen the red, I've seen the blue
Take all of me
Deep to where your secrets hide
Where we've been a thousand times
Swallow every single lie
Take all of me

[Chorus: Luke & Calum]
I'll never give you away
'Cause I already made that mistake
If my name never fell off your lips again
I know it'd be such a shame
When I take a look at my life and all of my crimes
You're the only thing that I think I got right
I'll never give you away
'Cause I already made, already made that mistake

[Verse 1: Luke]
Some things are meant to be secret and not to be heard
So if I tell you, just keep it and don't say a word
Yeah, when the doors are all closing, it's bound to get loud
'Cause all these bodies are hoping to get addicted to sound

[Pre-Chorus: Luke]
Oh, not everything is so primitive
Oh, but I'm giving in

[Chorus: Luke & Ashton]
If these walls could talk, I'd hope they wouldn't say anything
Because they've seen way too many things
'Cause we'd fall from grace, we're falling
Yeah, we'd fall from grace
If these walls could talk, I'd hope they wouldn't say anything
Because they've seen way too many things
'Cause we'd fall from grace, we're falling
Yeah, we'd fall from grace
If these walls could talk

[Post-Chorus: Luke]
If these walls could talk
If these walls could talk

[Verse 2: Calum]
I love your hair in your face
I wouldn't dare let you down
Don't let that glass go to waste
Oh, you're a queen but uncrowned

[Pre-Chorus: Luke]
Oh, not everything is so primitive
Oh, but I'm giving in

[Chorus: Luke & Ashton]
If these walls could talk, I'd hope they wouldn't say anything
Because they've seen way too many things
'Cause we'd fall from grace, we're falling
Yeah, we'd fall from grace
If these walls could talk

[Post-Chorus: Ashton]
If these walls could talk
If these walls could talk

[Bridge: Luke]
Some things are meant to be secret and not to be heard
So if I tell you, just keep it and don't say a word

[Chorus: Luke & Ashton]
If these walls could talk, I'd hope they wouldn't say anything

If these walls could talk
If these walls could talk

[Verse 1: Luke]
I don't wanna think about a moment with you
I'm kinda hoping for forever
I've been dreaming 'bout a knitted sweater for two
Goddamnit, we look good together

[Pre Chorus: Luke]
Would you wait a moment?
They're ringing the bell for last call
Would you wait a moment?
Just give me a second, that's all

[Chorus: All]
Oh, talk fast, romance
Oh, it won't last, I'm okay with that
Oh, burn, crash, romance
Oh, I'll take what I can get from you
Talk fast, romance
Oh, it won't last, I'm okay with that
Oh, burn, crash, romance
Oh, I'll take what I can get from you

[Verse 2: Calum]
Leave all of your indecisions with you at home
Don't say you're doing me a favor
Why so complicated, won't you throw me a bone?
I want your love in every flavor

[Pre Chorus: Calum]
Would you wait a moment?
They're ringing the bell for last call
Would you wait a moment?
Just give me a second, that's all

[Chorus: All]
Oh, talk fast, romance

Burn, crash, oh, oh
Talk fast, oh, oh

[Verse 1: Luke, Calum & ]
My girlfriends bitching 'cause I always sleep in
Shes always screaming when shes calling her friends
Shes kinda hot though
Yeah, shes kinda hot though

My shrink is telling me I've got crazy dreams
Shes also saying I've got low self-esteem
Shes kinda hot though
Yeah, shes kinda hot though

She put me on meds, she wont get out of my head
Shes kinda hot though


[Verse 2: Luke & ]
My friend left college 'cause it felt like a job
His mum and dad both think hes a slob
Hes got a shot though

Yeah, hes got a shot though

When you've got bigger plans that no one else understands
You've got a shot though


[Chorus: All & ]
They say were losers and were alright with that
We are the leaders of the not coming backs
But were alright though
Yeah, were alright though
We are the kings and the queens of the new broken scene
Yeah, were alright though


[Verse 3: Ashton & ]
Sometimes I'm feeling like I'm going insane
My neighbour told me that I've got bad brains
But I'm alright though 
Yeah, well be alright though 
'Cause we're the kings and the queens of the new broken scene
And we're alright though


[Chorus: All]
They say were losers and were alright with that
We are the leaders of the not coming backs
But were alright though 
Yeah, were alright though 
We are the kings and the queens of the new broken scene

[Intro: Luke]
Shout out to the old me and everything you showed me
Glad you didn't listen whentheworld was tryingto slow me
No one could controlme, left my lovers lonely
Had to fuck it up before I really got to know me

[Verse 1: Luke]
Never a night alone, anywhere you wanna go
Woke up in the mornin' wearin' someone else's clothes
Pictures in my phone with people I don't know
Woke up in the mornin', how the hell'd I make it home?

[Pre-Chorus: Luke]
And they wondered how long I could keep it up
While I wondered if I'd ever, if I'd ever get enough
And I did some shit I never should've done, eh-eh
I would do it over now, I'd do it over

[Chorus: Luke]
Shout out to the old me and everything you showed me
Glad you didn't listen when the world was trying to slow me
No one could control me, left my lovers lonely
Had to fuck it up before I really got to know me, eh-eh
All of the mistakes I made, I made, I made, I made
Whatever the price I paid, I paid, I paid, I paid
Shout out to the old me and everything you showed me
Had to fuck it up before I let you get to know me

[Verse 2: Luke]
Another round, here we go, going in blow for blow
Look into the mirror, take the punches that I throw
I'm constantly reminded of all the compromises
By the people from my past who have a hard time letting go, yeah

[Pre-Chorus: Luke]
And they wondered how long I could keep it up
While I wondered if I'd ever, if I'd ever get enough
And I did some shit I never should've done, eh-eh
I would do it over now, I'd do it over

[Chorus: Luke]
Shout out to the old me and everything you showed me
Glad you didn't listen when the world was trying to slow me
No one could control me, left my lovers lonely
Had to fuck it up before I really got to know me, eh-eh

Whatever the price I paid, I paid, I paid, I paid
Shout out to the old me and everything you showed me
Had to fuck it up before I let you get to know me, eh-eh

[Bridge: Luke]
Devil at my door
Got me knockin', knockin', knockin' on the other side
Ashes on the floor
But I'm walkin', walkin', walkin' outta here alive

[Chorus: Luke with Calum]
Shout out to the old me and everything you showed me
Glad you didn't listen when the world was trying to slow me 
No one could control me, left my lovers lonely 
Had to fuck it up before I really got to know me, eh-eh
All of the mistakes I made, I made, I made, I made
Whatever the price I paid, I paid, I paid, I paid 
Shout out to the old me and everything you showed me 
Had to fuck it up before I let you get to know me, eh-eh

[Verse 1: Luke & All]
I can still taste the ocean like it was today
You said, please keep on holding your hand and
The rain it came too soon, I will wait for you
To love me again

[Chorus: Michael]
I guess I was running from something
I was running back to you
Lost here in London with nothing
I'm still running back to you
If you could love me again
I could let go of everything

[Verse 2: Luke & All]
If I was an island in search of castaways
Maybe I'll find you here and
The rain it came too soon, I will wait for you
To love me again

[Chorus: Calum]
I guess I was running from something
I was running back to you
Lost here in London with nothing
I'm still running back to you
If you could love me again
I could let go of everything

[Bridge: Michael & All & Luke & Calum]
The darkest night never felt so bright with you by my side
The darkest night never felt so bright with you by my side
The darkest night never felt so bright with you by my side
The darkest night never felt so bright with you by my side

Nothing like the rain, nothing like the rain
When you're in outer space, when you're in outer space
Nothing like the rain, nothing like the rain
When you're in outer space, when you're in outer space
Nothing like the rain, nothing like the rain
When you're in outer space, when you're in outer space
Nothing like the rain, nothing like the rain
When you're in outer space, when you're in outer space
Love me like you did, love me like you did
I'll give you anything, I'll give you anything
Love me like you did, love me like you did
I'll give you anything, I'll give you anything

[Segue]

Carry On:

[Verse 1: Luke]
Carry on, let the good times roll
Sail on, let your path unfold
It won't be long, won't be long, won't be long
You know it's gonna get better, you know it's gonna get better
Say a prayer for the broken bones
'Cause who cares? We're all going home
And it won't be long, won't be long, won't be long
You know it's gonna get better, you know it's gonna get better

[Bridge: Luke & Calum]
I got one foot in the golden life, one foot in the gutter
So close to the other side, so far from the wonder
I got one foot in the golden life, one foot in the gutter
So sick of the tug of war, it keeps pulling me under

[Chorus: All]
Let the good times roll
Let the good times roll

[Verse 2: Luke]
Carry on, outlast the ignorance
Moving on, survive the innocence
Won't be long, won't be long, won't be long
You know it's gonna get better

[Verse 1: Calum]
Another day of painted walls and football on the TV
No one sees me
I fade away, lost inside a memory of someone's life
It wasn't mine

[Chorus: Calum]
I was already missing before the night I left
Just me and my shadow and all of my regrets
Who am I? Who am I when I don't know myself?
Who am I? Who am I? Invisible

[Verse 2: Calum]
Wasted days, dreaming of the times I know I can't get back
Seems I just lost track
Looking on as all of life's colours seem to fade to grey
I just walked away

[Chorus: Calum]
I was already missing before the night I left
Just me and your shadow and all of my regrets
Who am I? Who am I when I don't know myself?
Who am I? Who am I? Invisible

Who am I? Who am I when I don't know myself?
Who am I? Who am I? Invisible
Who am I? Who am I when I don't know myself?
Who am I? Who am I? Invisible

[Outro: Calum]
Another day, the walls are built to keep me safe
I can't escape, it's too late

[Chorus: All]
Red, red desert, heal our blues
I'd dive deeper for you
What a blessing to feel yourlove
Twilightmoments with you

[Verse 1: Luke]
Ivebeen asleep so long, I'm sofar away
Visions I see are strong, I hear what they say
Won't you leave all your fears at the edge of the world?
Ill tell you again like I told you before
I've been asleep so long, wasting away

[Pre-Chorus: Luke]
Tell me, would you pack up all your bags, stay true to North?
You're the only one I'd do this for

[Chorus: All]
Red, red desert, heal our blues
I'd dive deeper for you
What a blessing to feel your love

The demons we're running from , they're begging to stay

[Chorus: Luke & All]
Drink all night, never sleep
You say, "Go," I won't leave
I love you, you love me
Butnotin the sameway
Rip my heart out and leave
Onthe floor, watch me bleed
I love you, you love me
But not in the same way

[Verse 1: Luke]
Not today
Mascara's runnin' down your face again
I can feel it comin' down on me
Hurricane insert name
We're good at this game, game

[Pre-Chorus: Luke]
We fuck, and we fight, then you call me a psycho
I walk out the door, but you won't let me let go
Turn right around, throwin' rocks at your window
But I can't forget you, and I'll always let you

[Chorus: Luke & All]
Drink all night, never sleep
You say, "Go," I won't leave
I love you, you love me
But not in the same way
Rip my heart out and leave
On the floor, watch me bleed
I love you, you love me
But not in the same way
Drink all night, never sleep
You say, "Go," I won't leave
I love you, you love me
But not in the same way
Rip my heart out and leave
On the floor, watch me bleed
I love you, you love me
But not in the same way

[Verse 2: Luke & All]
Not today
I'm wakin' up to my mistakes again
I know you love to point them out
Baby, I'm sick of sadness and you're sick of Xanax
We're good at this game, game

[Pre-Chorus: Luke]
We fuck, and we fight, then you call me a psycho
I walk out the door, but you won't let me let go
Turn right around, throwin' rocks at your window
But I can't forget you, and I'll always let you

[Chorus: Luke & All]
Drink all night, never sleep
You say, "Go," I won't leave
I love you, you love me
But not in the same way
Rip my heart out and leave
On the floor, watch me bleed
I love you, you love me
But not in the same way
Drink all night, never sleep
You say, "Go," I won't leave
I love you, you love me
But not in the same way
Rip my heart out and leave
On the floor, watch me bleed
I love you, you love me
But not in the same way

[Post-Chorus: All]
Way
But not in the same way
Way
But not in the same way

[Bridge: Luke, Luke & Calum]
I don't ever wanna lie to you
But I can't say no to you
I know you think I'm bulletproof
But you know how to hurt me too
In the dark, we're black and white
In the morning, colourblind
Leave your mark with every bite
Then everything's alright
When you tell me you love me
Then you wanna leave me
Pouring your pills down the sink
Sayin' "It's not what you think"
Don't know if I love you
Don't know if I hate you
But I can't forget you, and I'll always let you

[Chorus: Luke & All]
Drink all night, never sleep
You say, "Go," I won't leave
I love you, you love me
But not in the same way
Rip my heart out and leave
On the floor, watch me bleed
I love you, you love me
But not in the same way
Drink all night, never sleep
You say, "Go," I won't leave
I love you, you love me
But not in the same way
Rip my heart out and leave
On the floor, watch me bleed
I love you, you love me
But not in the same way

[Post-Chorus: All]
Way
But not in the same way
Way
But not in the same way

[Verse 1: Luke]
I'll take what you got, got, got
I know it's not a lot, lot, lot
'Cause I just need another hit
You're the thing that I can't quit
You got what I want, want, want
Here and then you're gone, gone, gone
If you told me that we were through
You know that I would break the truth

[Chorus: Luke & Michael]
I want to breathe you in like a vapor
I want to be the one you remember
I want to feel your love like the weather
All over me, all over me
I want to print our hands in the pavement
Savour your words, I won't ever waste them
Look in your eyes and know just what you meant
So lie to me, just lie to me

[Verse 2: Calum]
So talk, talk, talk
Well, tell me what I want, want, want
If I don't look into your eyes
Its almost like a perfect lie
So don't stop, stop, stop
We'll take another shot, shot, shot
'Cause you know you got perfect aim
I wanna feel you in my veins

[Chorus: Luke & Michael]
I want to breathe you in like a vapor
I want to be the one you remember
I want to feel your love like the weather
All over me, all over me
I want to print our hands in the pavement
Savour your words, I won't ever waste them
Look in your eyes and know just what you meant
So lie to me, just lie to me

[Bridge: Luke]
You make it sound so sweet
When you lie to me
Make it sound so sweet
When you lie to me

[Chorus: Luke & Michael]
I want to breathe you in like a vapor
I want to be the one you remember
I want to feel your love like the weather
All over me, all over me
I want to print our hands in the pavement
Savour your words, I won't ever waste them
Look in your eyes and know just what you meant
So lie to me, just lie to me

[Outro: Luke]
Make it sound so sweet
When you lie to me
Make it sound so sweet
When you lie to me

[Verse 1: Luke & Calum]
Runaways, we're the long lost children
Running to the edge of the world
Everybody wants to throw us away
Broken boy meets broken girl
You said you tried it all before
And it only makes it worse
Oh, but this time, maybe this time
Two wrongs make a right

[Chorus: All]
We'll safety pin the pieces of our broken hearts back together
Patching up all the holes until we both feel much better
Deleted things are really meant
So now Ill say the things I never sent
We'll safety pin the pieces of our broken hearts back together

[Verse 2: Ashton]
Throwing rocks at your broken window
Only you can cure my sickness
Raise a toast and a middle finger
'Cause they all think we're twisted
Once I got a little taste
Now I'm addicted to your fix
Oh yeah, this time, maybe this time
Two wrongs make a right

[Chorus: All]
We'll safety pin the pieces of our broken hearts back together
Patching up all the holes until we both feel much better
Deleted things are really meant
So now Ill say the things I never sent
We'll safety pin the pieces of our broken hearts back together

[Bridge: Luke & All & Michael]
No more waiting, we can save us from falling
No more waiting, we can save us from falling
No more waiting, we can save us from falling
No more waiting, we can save us from falling
No more waiting, we can save us from falling
This time, maybe this time

[Chorus: All]
We'll safety pin the pieces of our broken hearts back together
Patching up all the holes until we both feel much better
Deleted things are really meant
So now Ill say the things I never sent
We'll safety pin the pieces of our broken hearts back together

[Outro: Luke & All]
No more waiting, we can save us from falling
No more waiting, we can save us from falling
No more waiting, we can save us from falling
No more waiting, we can save us from falling

[Intro]
Why?
Why?

[Verse 1: Luke]
Switching into airplane mode again
We're not alright but I'll pretend
Press my cheek against the glass
Just be good 'til I get back

[Pre-Chorus: Luke]
The ground disappears
I hold back the tears
I check my phone to see your face
Staring back as if to say
Don't worry, you won't be lonely

[Chorus: All]
Why won't you love me?
Why won't you love me?
You imagine when you close your eyes
You're with me on the other side
So why won't you love me?

[Verse 2: Calum & Michael]
Few drinks deep at a table for one
The place we like to go and you take yourself home again
Three missed calls at 2 AM
You say you never heard, you're late to get to work and then

[Pre-Chorus: Calum & Michael]
The time disappears
You hold back the tears
Your best girlfriend just got engaged
You say you can't wait and need to make a change
You told me it's so hard to be lonely

[Chorus: All]
Why won't you love me?
Why won't you love me?
We're together all alone tonight
So helpless from the other side
So why won't you love me?

[Bridge: All]
Can you tell me why, my love? Can you tell me why?
I hold on to you and you hold on to me
Can you tell me why, my love? Can you tell me why?
I hold on to you and you hold on

[Chorus: Luke & All]
Why won't you love me?
Why won't you love me?
Why won't you love me?
You imagine when you close your eyes
You're with me on the other side
So why won't you love me?

[Verse 1: Luke]
If me and you are living in the same place
Why do we feel alone? Feel alone?
A house that's full of everything we wanted
But it's an empty home, empty home

[Pre-Chorus: Luke]
Why can't we choose our emotion?
'Cause we could feel something's broken
And I can't stay without hoping
We'll never be alone, we'll never be alone, oh

[Chorus: Luke & All]
And all the things that we dream about
They don't mean what they did before
I just wanna get back to us
'Cause we used to have more
Why does it feel like we're missing out?
Like I'm standing behind the door
I just wanna get back to us
'Cause we used to have more

[Verse 2: Calum]
'Cause lately we've been living in different nations
Enemy lines are drawn, lines are drawn
We're speaking different tongues communicating
Right through the bedroom wall, bedroom wall

[Pre-Chorus: Calum]
And as we fall, time is frozen
I know we break, but we're not broken
'Cause I can't stay without hoping
We'll never be alone, we'll never be alone, oh

[Chorus: Luke & All]
And all the things that we dream about
They don't mean what they did before
I just wanna get back to us
'Cause we used to have more
Why does it feel like we're missing out?
Like I'm standing behind the door
I just wanna get back to us
'Cause we used to have more
And all the things that we dream about
They don't mean what they did before
I just wanna get back to us
'Cause we used to have more
Why does it feel like we're missing out?
Like I'm standing behind the door
I just wanna get back to us
'Cause we used to have more

[Verse 1: Luke]
You've got a million reasons to hesitate
But darling, the future's better than yesterday
I wasted somuchtime on peoplethat reminded me of you
Gave youa million reasons to walk away

[Pre-Chorus: Luke]
But I'll build a house out of the mess and all the broken pieces
I'll make up for all of your tears

[Chorus: Luke]
I'll give you the best years
I'll give you the best years
Past love, burned out like a cigarette
I promise, darling, you won't regret
The best years

[Verse 2: Luke, Luke & Calum]
I wanna hold your hair when you drink too much
And carry you home when you cannot stand up
You did all these things for me when I was half a man for you
I wanna hold your hand while we're growing up

[Pre-Chorus: Luke]
But I'll build a house out of the mess and all the broken pieces
I'll make up for all of your tears

[Chorus: Luke, Luke & Michael]
I'll give you the best years
I'll give you the best years
Past love, burned out like a cigarette
I promise, darling, you won't regret
The best years
The best years

[Instrumental Bridge]

[Chorus: Luke, Luke & Michael]
I'll give you the best years
I'll give you the best years
Past love, burned out like a cigarette
I promise, darling, you won't regret
The best years
I'll give you the best years

[Intro]
Check, two

[Chorus: Luke]
I hope you think of me high
I hope you think of me highly
When you'rewithsomeone else
I knowyour friends all lie
I know yourfriends don't like me
They want you for themselves

[Verse 1: Luke]
Today, I've called to tell you that I'm changing
But I don't think you have enough respect to see me try
I've been waking up in different spaces
And I think that my heart is built to last more than a night

[Pre-Chorus: Luke & Calum]
I need to stop letting me down, down, down, down, down
I need to stop letting me down, down, down, down, down

[Chorus: Luke]
I hope you think of me high
I hope you think of me highly
When you're with someone else
I know your friends all lie
I know your friends don't like me
They want you for themselves

[Verse 2: Luke & All]
I know I'll never meet your expectations 
But the picture that you paint of me looks better in your mind
Now every step I take with hesitation 
And I'll always miss the memories of the mornings we were high

[Pre-Chorus: Luke & Calum]
I need to stop letting me down, down, down, down, down
I need to stop letting me down, down, down, down, down

[Chorus: All]
I hope you think of me high
I hope you think of me highly
When you're with someone else
I know your friends all lie
I know your friends don't like me
They want you for themselves

[Post-Chorus: All]
Da-da-da, da-da-da-da-da
Da-da-da, ooh
When you're with someone else
Da-da-da, da-da-da-da-da
Da-da-da, ooh
They want you for themselves

[Outro: Luke]
I hope you think of me high
I hope you think of me highly
When you're with someone else

[Verse 1: Michael]
You say that I'm too complicated
Hung up and miseducated
I say 9-to-5 is overrated
And we all fall down
I can't sleep 'cause my mind keeps racing
My chest hurts 'cause my heart keeps breaking
I'm so numb and I can't stop shaking
And we all fall down

[Pre-Chorus: Luke]
Frustration, desperation
They say I need some kind of medication
Situation: no motivation
Destination: permanent vacation

[Chorus: All & Michael]
Hey, I'm doing fine
And I know I'm out of line
So let's sing this one more time
It goes, destination: permanent vacation
Na na, na na na na na

[Verse 2: Calum]
Voices are coming through the speakers
And they can't make me a believer
I know I'm an underachiever
And we're all so proud
Watch out, I think we're going under
Right now you're just another number
Get out, the system's in the gutter
And we're all so proud

[Pre-Chorus: Luke]
Frustration, desperation
They say I need some kind of medication
Situation: no motivation
Destination: permanent vacation

[Chorus: All & Michael]
Hey, I'm doing fine
And I know I'm out of line
So let's sing this one more time
It goes, destination: permanent vacation
Hey, I'm doing fine
And I know I'm out of line
So let's sing this one more time
It goes, destination: permanent vacation
Na na, na na na na na
Na na, na na na na na

[Bridge: Michael & All]
Congratulations, your imitations

Corporations, calculations
We're the voice of the new generation
Congratulations, your imitations
Are taking over the radio stations
Corporations, calculations
We're the voice of the new generation

[Chorus: All & Luke & Michael]
Hey, I'm doing fine
And I know I'm out of line
So let's sing this one more time
It goes, destination: permanent vacation
Hey, I'm doing fine

Stop digging in your heart 'cause tonight is on me
Tonight is on me
Stop trying so hard is what you said to me
What you said to me

[Pre-Chorus: Luke]
Get you high when I'm high
So we see eye-to-eye, woah, oh
Take the high with the low
And away and away we go

[Chorus: Luke & All]
Living our lives
Dancing on empty wallets
Spend it all on you
Spend it all on you
Until we die
Dancing on empty wallets
Spend it all on you

We got a whole night, won't you live it with me?
Live it with me?
We got our whole lives, but living ain't cheap
Living ain't cheap

Get you high when I'm high
So we see eye-to-eye, woah, oh
Take the high with the low

Sugar coated brain
The fluid ain't to blame
For the sugar coated pain

[Chorus: All & Michael]
We're living our lives
Dancing on empty wallets
Spend it all on you
Spend it all on you

[Bridge: Michael]
I always believed in second chances
I always believed in you

Living our lives
Dancing on empty wallets
Spend it all on you
Spend it all on you
Until we die

[Intro: Luke]
I'm not leaving

[Verse 1: Luke]
Every time you say to me it's over
You just wanna start again, it's just lies
The girl who cries wolf every day
Ignored by gravity, but in the end, don't ask why

[Pre-Chorus: Luke]
You say you wanna but do you wanna run away?
Your great escape, oh yeah
Where you going? Always running
Find a way to call it quits again

[Chorus: Ashton]
So look at me in the eye
Is anyone there at all?
Is anyone there at all?
'Cause I'm not dreaming
So look at me in the eye
Is anyone there at all?
Is anyone there at all?
'Cause I'm not leaving

[Verse 2: Calum & Luke]
Does it have to be this tragedy? This endless lost parade
A castle of faade and make believe
The truth is spelled out in your eyes
Why don't you just reach out and make it clear to me?
What are you telling me?

[Pre-Chorus: Luke]
You say you wanna, but do you wanna run away?
Your great escape, oh yeah
Where you going? Always running
Find a way to call it quits again

[Chorus: Ashton]
So look at me in the eye
Is anyone there at all?
Is anyone there at all?
'Cause I'm not dreaming
So look at me in the eye
Is anyone there at all?
Is anyone there at all?
'Cause I'm not leaving

[Bridge: Michael & Calum]
Is anyone there at all? Is anyone there at all?
Is anyone there? Is anyone there at all?
Is anyone there at all? Is anyone there at all?
Is anyone there at all? 'Cause I'm not dreaming
Is anyone there at all? Is anyone there at all?
Is anyone there? Is anyone there at all?

[Outro: Michael]
Look at me in the eye
Is anyone there at all?
Is anyone there at all?
I'm not dreaming
Look at me in the eye
Is anyone there at all?
Is anyone there at all?
'Cause I'm not leaving

One, two, three

Your type of mind, so hard to find
Native of mine, you're just mykind
Downon my knees,I'll always follow
I promise you untilthe end of time
Our house on fire, we're burnin'
We dance inside, you're hurtin'
If you leave me in the mornin'
I'll have such a

[Chorus: All]
Such a lonely heart, oh woah
Such a lonely heart, oh woah 
If you can't find another reason to stay
Then I know I'm gonna always have a lonely, lonely, lonely, lonely
Heart, oh woah 
Heart

[Verse 2: Luke, All, Luke & Calum]
Your precious heart, can't watch it break 
So I close my eyes while you walk away, mmm 
Can I have a second chance?
Can I have another dance?
Can I start another life with you? Yeah 
When I wake up in a haze and I haven't slept in days
You're a thousand miles away with

[Chorus: All]
Such a lonely heart, oh woah
Such a lonely heart, oh woah 
If you can't find another reason to stay
Then I know I'm gonna always have a lonely, lonely, lonely, lonely

Lonely, it ain't nothin' new
Nothin' new to me, nothin' new to you 
Lonely, it ain't nothin' new

Lonely, it ain't nothin' new
Nothin' new to me, nothin' new to you

Heart

[Verse 1: Ashton]
Even every time that I'm mad at you
I would, still bury that body for you
I would, take a shovel dig it six feet under
Swear to God I wouldn't tell another
Even every time that you got the flu
I'm not scared at all to get close to you
I don't run away when your face says, "Achoo"
But I run to get you a tissue

[Pre-Chorus: Ashton/All]
I don't count the days
Most people I hate

[Chorus: Ashton/All]
You're my best friend
No, I didn't stutter 'til the day end
Through heaven and high water
Ooh, it kills me not to tell you
You're my best friend
My, my best friend

[Verse 2: Ashton]
Remember when your parents went out of town?
They were, dumb enough to leave us with the house
We had 100 people naked on the sofa
Dancing 'til the cops said, "Game over"
Turns out that it was Jerrys dad
So we did shots while we rode in the back
He even let us all use the siren
It was the best night, I'm not lying

[Pre-Chorus: Ashton/All]
I don't count the days
Most people I hate

[Chorus: Ashton/All]
You're my best friend
No, I didn't stutter 'til the day end
Through heaven and high water
Ooh, it kills me not to tell you
You're my best friend
My, my best friend

[Instrumental Bridge]

[Pre-Chorus: Ashton/All]
Most people I hate...

[Chorus: Ashton/All]
You're my best friend
No, I didn't stutter 'til the day end
Through heaven and high water
Ooh, it kills me not to tell you
You're my best friend
My, my best friend
Ooh, ooh, you're my best friend
Ooh, ooh, you're my best friend

[Intro: Luke]
Cut me open, take my heart
So we'll never be apart
Don't you let it go to waste

[Verse 1: Luke]
Such a sentimental love, in a cynical world
My feelings get the best of me 
I messed it up before, so I'm almost pretty sure
My karma got the best of me 

[Pre-Chorus: Luke]
I'm bad at letting go
Won't you let me down easy?
I can't let you go, so

[Chorus: Luke & All]
When you walk away
Cut me open, take my heart
So we'll never be apart
Don't you let it go to waste
When you walk away
I can feel it in my bones, you don't love me anymore
Make it worth all of the pain
When you walk away, yeah

[Verse 2: Calum]
I've been dreaming like a fool, in a nightmare of a world
It's bringing out the worst in me  
Shook me to the core, my optimism floored
My karma got the worst of me 

[Pre-Chorus: Calum]
I'm bad at letting go
Won't you let me down easy?
I can't let you go, so

[Chorus: Luke & All]
When you walk away
Cut me open, take my heart
So we'll never be apart
Don't you let it go to waste
When you walk away
I can feel it in my bones, you don't love me anymore
Make it worth all of the pain
When you walk away, yeah

[Bridge: Calum]
I'm so bad at letting go
How do you make it look so easy?
I'm so bad at letting go
How do you make it look so easy?

[Chorus: Luke & All]
Cut me open, take my heart
So we'll never be apart
Don't you let it go to waste
When you walk away
I can feel it in my bones, you don't love me anymore
Make it worth all of the pain
When you walk away

[Outro: Michael & All]
I'm so bad at letting go
How do you make it look so easy?
When you walk away
I'm so bad at letting go
How do you make it look so easy?
When you walk away

[Verse 1: Calum]
Replay the scene over again
Before the credits rolling in
Inside my head
I dont recall a single word
They hit me faster than I heard
Inside my head

[Pre-Chorus: Luke]
And now I'm shaking, wearing thin
I always wonder where you've been
Tell me if you wanted it at all

[Chorus: All]
I got a long-term plan with short-term fixes
And a wasted heart that just eclipses
And I push my luck from trust to dust enough
That's the story of another us
One last-ditch, a new beginning
So take this heart, put yourself in it
This surprise ending I'm depending on
Could be the story of another us
The story of another us
The story of another us
The story of another us
Could be the story of another us

[Verse 2: Luke]
Memories are pay-per-view
It costs too much to think of you
I'm hanging by a thread
An epilogue before we're done
A sequel to what we've begun
I'm hanging by a thread

[Pre-Chorus: Luke]
And now before our hope is lost
My heart is here at such a cost
Tell me if you wanted it at all

[Chorus: All]
I got a long-term plan with short-term fixes
And a wasted heart that just eclipses
And I push my luck from trust to dust enough
That's the story of another us
One last-ditch, a new beginning
So take this heart, put yourself in it
This surprise ending I'm depending on
Could be the story of another us
The story of another us
The story of another us
The story of another us
Could be the story of another us

[Bridge: Michael & Calum]
Draw me beside you
Where I'll be to remind you
We're still first in line for
The front row of last resorts
One last-ditch, a new beginning
So take this heart put yourself in it
This surprise ending I'm depending on

[Chorus: All]
I got a long-term plan with short-term fixes
And a wasted heart that just eclipses
And I push my luck from trust to dust enough
That's the story of another us
One last-ditch, a new beginning
So take this heart, put yourself in it
This surprise ending I'm depending on
Could be the story of another us
The story of another us
The story of another us
The story of another us
Could be the story of another us

[Verse 1: Luke]
I don't feel your love
But I don't ask too many questions
The words, they are toomuch
Whenyou show memy reflection

[Pre-Chorus: Luke & All]
When the sun goes down,we all get lonely
Watch me as I disappear
These empty sounds and endless stories
So tell me what I wanna hear 

[Chorus: Luke & All]
Killin' me slow with the words you wrote
The heart you broke, the heart you broke, yeah
Callin' my name, I don't wanna stay
But I'm wide awake, I'm wide awake 
Just one more taste of you, my love 
Killin' me slow with the words you wrote
The heart you broke, the heart you broke, yeah

[Verse 2: Luke]
You never call me out
You know exactly where I'm goin'
You got me by the mouth
But she said she love me, she don't show it

[Pre-Chorus: Luke & All]
When the sun goes down, we all get lonely
Watch me as I disappear
These empty sounds and endless stories
So tell me what I wanna hear 

[Chorus: Luke & All]
Killin' me slow with the words you wrote
The heart you broke, the heart you broke, yeah
Callin' my name, I don't wanna stay
But I'm wide awake, I'm wide awake 
Just one more taste of you, my love 
Killin' me slow with the words you wrote
The heart you broke, the heart you broke, yeah

[Bridge: Luke & All]
I don't think I like me anymore
Can someone tell me who I was before?
I don't really like me anymore
Anymore, anymore 

[Chorus: Luke & All]
Killin' me slow with the words you wrote
The heart you broke, the heart you broke, yeah
Callin' my name, I don't wanna stay
But I'm wide awake, I'm wide awake 
Just one more taste of you, my love 
Killin' me slow with the words you wrote
The heart you broke, the heart you broke, yeah


[Outro: Luke]
I don't think I like me anymore
Can someone tell me who I was before?
I don't really like me anymore
Anymore

[Verse 1: Luke]
Find me at a quarter to three, cigarette in my hand
I'd be at every party, I wouldn't miss a chance
New friends again and again, gone when the morning comes
Demons I try to defend, but I couldn't get enough

[Pre-Chorus: Luke]
Fading away, fading away
Wake up to someone with nothing to say
I'd never change, thought I'd never change
Then you come and change it all

[Chorus: All]
With your love, your love, I'm a better, better man
With your love, your love, I'm a better, better man
Darling, all of my wrongs, they led me right to you
Wrapped in your arms, I swear I'd die for
Your love, your love, I'm a better, better man

[Verse 2: Luke]
Thought I'd found the highest of highs
You came and topped them all
You shine in the dead of the night
And I was the first to fall

[Pre-Chorus: Luke]
Fading away, fading away
Wake up to someone with nothing to say
I'd never change, thought I'd never change
Then you come and change it all

[Chorus: All]
With your love, your love, I'm a better, better man
With your love, your love, I'm a better, better man
Darling, all of my wrongs, they led me right to you
Wrapped in your arms, I swear I'd die for
Your love, your love, I'm a better, better man

[Bridge: Luke/All]
You're the only one, who could lock this wild heart up in chains
You're the only love, that can make this bad man better
You're the only one, who could lock this wild heart up in chains
You're the only love, that can make this bad man better

[Chorus: Luke & All]
With your love, your love, I'm a better, better man
With your love, your love, I'm a better, better man
All of my wrongs, they led me right to you
Wrapped in your arms, I swear I'd die for
Your love, your love, I'm a better, better man
With your love, your love, I'm a better, better man
With your love, your love, I'm a better, better man
Darling, all of my wrongs, they led me right to you
Wrapped in your arms, I swear I'd die for
Your love, your love, I'm a better, better man

[Outro: Luke & All]
Your love, your love, your love
I'm a better, better man
Your love, your love, love, love

Drivin' through the gated residential
Found out I was comin', sent your friends home
Keep on tryna hide it but your friends know

Bought mama a crib and a brand new wagon

We don't pray for love, we just pray for cars

[Verse 1]
And I know she'll be the death of me
At least we'll both be numb
And she'll always get the best of me
The worst is yet to come
But at least we'll both be beautiful and stay forever young
This I know, yeah, this I know

[Verse 1]
We found each other
I helped you out of a broken place
You gave me comfort
But falling for you was my mistake

[Pre-Chorus]
I put you on top, I put you on top
I claimed you so proud and openly
And when times were rough, when times were rough
I made sure I held you close to me

[Chorus]
So call out my name 
Call out my name when I kiss you so gently
I want you to stay 
I want you to stay even though you don't want me
Girl, why can't you wait? 
Girl, why can't you wait 'til I fall out of love?
Won't you call out my name? 
Girl, call out my name, and I'll be on my way and
I'll be on my

[Verse 2]
I said I didn't feel nothing, baby, but I lied
I almost cut a piece of myself for your life
Guess I was just another pit stop
'Til you made up your mind
You just wasted my time

You were on top, I put you on top
I claimed you so proud and openly, babe
And when times were rough, when times were rough
I made sure I held you close to me

[Verse 1]
Record man play my song on the radio
You too busy tryna find that blue-eyed soul
I let my black hair grow and my weed smoke
And I swear too much on the regular
We gon' let them hits fly, we gon' let it go
If it ain't XO then it gotta go
I just won a new award for a kids show
Talking 'bout a face numbing off a bag of blow
I'm like, goddamn, bitch, I am not a Teen Choice
Goddamn, bitch, I am not a bleach boy
Whip game, make a nigga understand though
Got that Hannibal, Silence of the Lambo
Hit the gas so hard make it rotate
All my niggas blew up like a propane
All these R&B niggas be so lame
Got a sweet Asian chick, she go lo mein 

[Chorus]

You know me, know me 
You know man, know man 
You know me, know me 
Every time you try to forget who I am
I'll be right there to remind you again
You know me 
You know me 

[Verse 2]
Said I'm just tryna swim in something wetter than the ocean
Faded off a double cup, I'm mixing up the potion
All I wanna do is make that money and make dope shit
It just seem like niggas tryna sound like all my old shit
Everybody knows it, all these niggas know me
Platinum off a mixtape, sipping on that codeine
Pour it in my trophies, roll until my nose bleed
I'ma keep on singing while I'm burning up that OG
All my niggas get it, they make money all alone
Rock a chain around they neck, making sure I'm getting home
When I travel 'round the globe, make a couple mil' a show
And I come back to my city, I fuck every girl I know
Used to walk around with a slouch, had a mattress on the floor
Now my shit straight
Eating all day, tryna lose weight
That good sex, we'll sweat it out
Hotel bed springs, we'll wear it out
I ain't gotta tell you 'cause

[Chorus]
You know me 
You know me, know me 
You know man, know man 
You know me, know me 
Every time you try to forget who I am 
I'll be right there to remind you again 
You know me 
You know me 

[Bridge]
Why don't you shake some, shake somethin'
For the Don? Don't you break nothin', break nothin'
Baby girl, won't you work some, work somethin'
For the Don? Don't you hurt nothin', hurt nothin'
Big girl, won't you shake some, shake somethin' 
For the Don? Don't you break nothin' , break nothin'
Baby girl, won't you work some , work somethin'
For the Don? don't you hurt nothin', hurt nothin'

She 'bout to go downtown for a whole hour
If I had her, you can have her, man it don't matter
I'm never sour, I'm just smokin' somethin' much louder

'Cause they never tell me lies
I can feel that body shake
And the heat between your legs

[Pre-Chorus: The Weeknd]
You've been scared of love and what it did to you

Tryna find the one thatcan fix me
I've been dodgin' death in the six-speed
Amphetamine got my stummy feelin' sickly
Yeah, I want it all now
I've been runnin' through the pussy, need a dog pound
Hundred models gettin' faded in the compound
Tryna love me, but they never get a pulse down

[Chorus]
Why? 'Cause I'm heartless
And I'm back to my ways 'cause I'm heartless
All this money and this pain got me heartless
Low life for life 'cause I'm heartless

Tryna be a better man, but I'm heartless
Never be a weddin' plan for the heartless
Low life for life 'cause I'm heartless

[Verse 2]
Said I'm heartless
So much pussy, it be fallin' out the pocket
Metro Boomin turn this ho into a moshpit
Tesla pill got me flyin' like a cockpit
Yeah, I got her watchin'
Call me up, turn that pussy to a faucet
Duffle bags full of drugs and a rocket
Stix drunk, but he never miss a target
Photoshoots, I'm a star now 
I'm talkin' Time, Rolling Stone, and Bazaar now 
Sellin' dreams to these girls with their guard down 
Seven years, I've been swimmin' with the sharks now

[Chorus]
Why? 'Cause I'm heartless
And I'm back to my ways 'cause I'm heartless
All this money and this pain got me heartless
Low life for life 'cause I'm heartless

Tryna be a better man, but I'm heartless
Never be a weddin' plan for the heartless
Low life for life 'cause I'm heartless

[Bridge]
I lost my heart and my mind
I try to always do right
I thought I lost you this time
You just came back in my life
You never gave up on me 
I'll never know what you see 
I don't do well when alone 
You hear it clear in my tone

[Chorus]
'Cause I'm heartless 
And I'm back to my ways 'cause I'm heartless
All this money and this pain got me heartless
Low life for life 'cause I'm heartless
Said I'm heartless
Tryna be a better man, but I'm heartless
Never be a weddin' plan for the heartless
Low life for life 'cause I'm heartless[Refrain: The Weeknd]

[Verse 2: The Weeknd]
I've been poppin', just took three in a row
I'm down to do it again, I'm on a roll
I've seen him outside tryna reach her
You tryna leave him, you said I'm the reason
Tell me lies, ooh girl, tell me lies
Say you're mine, I'm yours for the night
I'm the realest, she said I'm the realest
Head be genius, dick game be the meanest

[Chorus: The Weeknd]
I'm like got up, thank the Lord for the day
Woke up by a girl, I don't even know her name
Woke up by a girl, I don't even know her name

Got up, thank the Lord for the day
Woke up by a girl, I don't even know her name
Woke up by a girl, I don't even know her name


[Bridge: The Weeknd]
Got up, thank the Lord for the day
Woke up by a girl, I don't even know her name
Bitches in my new spot, crowdin' up my space
Had to check the safe, check the dresser for my chains
Got up, thank the Lord for the day
Woke up by a girl, I don't even know her name
Bitches in my new spot, crowdin' up my space
Had to check the safe, check the dresser for my chains

But I see something in you

Paranoid 
But I see something in you


[Outro: The Weeknd & Lana Del Rey]








You're paranoid

[Verse 1]
I'm findin' ways to articulate the feeling I'm goin' through
I just can't say I don't love you
'Cause I love you, yeah
It's hard for me to communicate the thoughts that I hold
But tonight I'm gon' let you know
Let me tell the truth
Baby, let me tell the truth, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
You know what I'm thinkin', see it in your eyes
You hate that you want me, hate it when you cry
You're scared to be lonely, 'specially in the night
I'm scared that I'll miss you, happens every time
I don't want this feelin', I can't afford love
I try to find a reason to pull us apart
It ain't workin' 'cause you're perfect
And I know that you're worth it
I can't walk away, oh!

[Chorus]
Even though we're going through it and it makes you feel alone
Just know that I would die for you
Baby, I would die for you, yeah
The distance and the time between us
It'll never change my mind, 'cause baby
I would die for you
Baby, I would die for you, yeah

[Verse 2]
I'm finding ways to manipulate the feelin' you're goin' through
But baby girl, I'm not blamin' you
Just don't blame me, too, yeah
'Cause I can't take this pain forever
And you won't find no one that's better
'Cause I'm right for you, babe
I think I'm right for you, babe

[Pre-Chorus]
You know what I'm thinkin', see it in your eyes
You hate that you want me, hate it when you cry
It ain't workin' 'cause you're perfect
And I know that you're worth it
I can't walk away, oh!

[Chorus]
Even though we're going through it
And it makes you feel alone
Just know that I would die for you
Baby, I would die for you, yeah
The distance and the time between us
It'll never change my mind, 'cause baby
I would die for you
Baby, I would die for you, yeah

[Bridge]
I would die for you, I would lie for you
Keep it real with you, I would kill for you, my baby
I'm just sayin', yeah
I would die for you, I would lie for you
Keep it real with you, I would kill for you, my baby
Na-na-na, na-na-na, na-na-na

[Chorus]
Even though we're going through it
And it makes you feel alone
Just know that I would die for you
Baby, I would die for you, yeah
The distance and the time between us
It'll never change my mind, 'cause baby
I would die for you
Baby, I would die for you, yeah babe
[Verse 1]
Wasted times I spent with someone else
She wasn't even half of you
Reminiscin' how you felt
Reminiscin' how you felt
And even though you put my life through hell
I can't seem to forget 'bout you, 'bout you
I want you to myself

[Chorus]
And now I'm askin', who do you belong to now?
Who you give that love to now?
Who you pullin' up on?
Who you gettin' sprung for now?
And what they got that I ain't got? 'Cause I got a lot
Don't make me run up on 'em, got me blowin' up their spot
'Cause I ain't got no business catchin' feelings anyway
I ain't got no business catchin' feelings

[Verse 2]
Catchin' feelings
These girls only want you when you're winnin' 
But you've been with me from the beginnin' 
And I know right now that we're not talkin' 
I hope you know this dick is still an option
'Cause I'll beat it up 
I took my time to learn the way your body functions
You were equestrian, so ride it like a champion 
This sex will get you high without no other substance

[Chorus]
So who do you belong to now? 
Who you give that love to now? 
Who you pullin' up on?
Who you gettin' sprung for now? 
And what they got that I ain't got? 'Cause I got a lot 
Don't make me run up on 'em, got me blowin' up their spot 
'Cause I ain't got no business catchin' feelings anyway
I ain't got no business catchin' feelings 

[Bridge]
Catchin' feelings
I ain't got no business catchin' feelings
I ain't got no business catchin' feelings
Catchin' fee-fee-fee-fee
Feelings
I ain't got no business catchin' feelings
I ain't got no business catchin' feelings
Catchin' fee-fee-fee-fee

[Outro]
Wake up
I don't wanna wake up
I don't wanna wake up
If you ain't layin' next to me
I don't wanna wake up
I don't wanna wake up
I don't wanna wake up
If you ain't layin' next to me-e-e
On me, me, on me, oh, I
On me, on me, on me

[Intro: The Weeknd]
Uh, uh, uh, uh-uh, uh, yeah, like

[Verse 1: The Weeknd]
I ran out of tears when I was 18
So nobody made me but the main streets
'Cause too many people think they made me
Well, if they really made me then replace me
Homeless to Forbes List, these niggas bring no stress
I feel like Moses, I feel like I'm chosen
And if you ain't my nigga then your girl single to me
I don't give a damn if a nigga said he knew me
Grew up with no father so nobody ever "son" me
My flow too sick, Kevin Costner couldn't touch me
I know you wish that nobody ever love me
I feel useless when I'm never making money
Well, this the life we always fantasized
Rich folk problem through a Queen Street nigga's eyes
Every time you see me pulling up in Aventadors
Just know we been grinding on them sidewalks

[Chorus: The Weeknd]
Sidewalks saved my life
They don't ever lie
Sidewalks saved my life
They showed me all the signs

[Post-Chorus: Daniel Wilson]
They don't let me down
But they lead me on
And they don't let me down
But they lead me on
And they lead me on

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
Say, say, say
I come from murder one, brung late night melee
Say, say, say
We hung all summer, sprung mattress with bae bae
Say, say, say
Trippin' off Dyke, and my name strike with pay day
Say, say, say
Flippin' blue lightning, tightening, strapped with AK
Say, say, say
OG one, told me one, show me one, eight ways
How to segue
Pussy, power, profit and headache
I reminisce my life innocence or life innocent
Or life intimate, with fame
Light limo tint with light women, dark women in it
Awe Kenny, good game
She wanna hang with a Starboy
The sun and the moon and star, boy
Astronomer, anonymous
I line 'em up, we grind 'em up, there's nine of us
And five of us have probably fucked
She mollied up, I tallied up all the parts, boy
Twenty legs, arms, head 
Head, head, and more head 
Oh God, bless the dead 
I'm livin' life, high off life
I wear my chokes off to bed
I'm the greatest nigga, why you scared to say it?
I wanna rock, I wanna rock
I wanna cop more land, I never stop
I wanna quick advance on a bill if it ain't one
Break everything, I'm a hustler, came from

[Chorus: The Weeknd]
Sidewalks saved my life
They don't ever lie
Sidewalks saved my life
They showed me all the signs

[Post-Chorus: Daniel Wilson]
They don't let me down
But they lead me on
And they don't let me down
But they lead me on
And they lead me on

[Verse 1]
Thought I almost died in my dream again 
Fightin' for my life, Icouldn'tbreathe again
I'm fallin'in too deep 
Without you,I can't sleep 
'Cause my heart belongs to you
I'll risk it all for you
I want you next to me
This time, I'll never leave
I wanna share babies
Protection, we won't need
Your body next to me
Is just a memory
I'm fallin' in too deep, oh
Without you, I can't sleep
Insomnia relieve, oh
Talk to me, without you, I can't breathe

[Verse 2]
My darkest hours
Girl, I felt so alone inside of this crowded room
Different girls on the floor, distractin' my thoughts of you
I turned into the man I used to be, to be
Put myself to sleep
Just so I can get closer to you inside my dreams
Didn't wanna wake up 'less you were beside me
I just wanted to call you and say, and say

[Chorus]
Oh, baby
Where are you now when I need you most?
I'd give it all just to hold you close
Sorry that I broke your heart, your heart

[Verse 3]
Never comin' down, uh
I was running away from facin' reality, uh
Wastin' all of my time out living my fantasies
Spendin' money to compensate, compensate
'Cause I want you, baby, uh
I be livin' in heaven when I'm inside of you
It was simply a blessing wakin' beside you
I'll never let you down again, again

[Chorus]
Oh, baby
Where are you now when I need you most?
I'd give it all just to hold you close
Sorry that I broke your heart, your heart
I said, baby
I'll treat you better than I did before
I'll hold you down and not let you go
This time, I won't break your heart, your heart, yeah

[Bridge]
I know it's all my fault
Made you put down your guard
I know I made you fall
Then said you were wrong for me
I lied to you, I lied to you, I lied to you 
Can't hide the truth, I'd stay with her in spite of you
You did some things that you regret, still ride for you
'Cause this house is not a home

[Chorus]
Without my baby
Where are you now when I need you most?
I gave it all just to hold you close
Sorry that I broke your heart, your heart
And I said, baby
I'll treat you better than I did before
I'll hold you down and not let you go
This time, I won't break your heart, your heart, no[Produced by Che Pope, Kanye West and The Weeknd; Co-produced by Illangelo; Additional production by Mike Dean]

[Verse 1]
We are not the same, I am too reckless
I'm not tryna go in that direction
These niggas, they been doin' too much flexin'
And they about to call the wrong attention
And I don't got no patience, no more testin'
I do shit how I want, don't need no blessin'
XO niggas ain't nothin' to mess with
Nobody stoppin' us, oh no, we destined
And everybody 'round you is so basic
I'm never rockin' white, I'm like a racist
I don't drink my liquor with a chase in
That money is the only thing I'm chasin'
And some dope dimes on some coke lines
Gimme head all night, cum four times
Baby girl just wanna smoke a pound
Do an ounce, get some dick, tell her friends about it

[Chorus]
Go tell your friends about it 
Go tell your friends about it 
Go tell 'em what you know, what you seen
How I roll, how I get it on the low
Go tell your friends about it 
Go tell your friends about it
I'm that nigga with the hair
Singin' 'bout poppin' pills, fuckin' bitches, livin' life so trill

[Verse 2]
Last year I did all the politickin'
This year I'ma focus on the vision
I think these hoes deserve another fixin'
I'm talkin' 'bout the ones from the beginnin'
Don't believe the rumors, bitch, I'm still a user
I'm still rockin' camo and still roll with shooters
I'm a villain in my city, I just made another killin'
I'ma spend it all on bitches
And everybody fuckin', everybody fuckin'
Pussy on the house, everybody fuckin'
Man, I miss my city, man, it's been a minute
MIA a habit, Cali was the mission
Cruise through the west-end in my new Benz
I'm just tryna live life through a new lens
Drivin' by the streets I used to walk through
When I had no crib, I guess you call that shit a miracle

[Chorus]
Go tell your friends about it 
Go tell your friends about it 
Go tell 'em what you know, what you seen
How I roll, how I get it on the low
Go tell your friends about it 
Go tell your friends about it
I'm that nigga with the hair
Singin' 'bout poppin' pills, fuckin' bitches, livin' life so trill

[Bridge: Kanye West]
Roll some, think Ill roll some
To know some, if we both honest
Who lasts? Yeah, you lie
Spent the whole summer
Tryna be at the wrong place at the right time
But I know what's mine when I see it
I know

[Verse 3]
My cousin said I made it big and it's unusual
She tried to take a selfie at my Grandma's funeral
Used to roam on Queen, now I sing Queen Street anthems
Used to hate attention, now I pull up in that wagon
And I was broken, I was broken, I was so broke
I used to roam around the town when I was homeless
Me and Lamar would rob a nigga for his Jordans
And flip it just to get these hoes another nose fix
Now we get faded when we want, girl, we got choices
Lay them on the fuckin' table, we got choices
And if they wanna fuck my niggas, they got choices
They told me not to fall in love, that shit is pointless
Yeah, that shit is pointless
They told me not to fall in love, that shit is pointless
Yeah, that shit is pointless
They told me not to fall in love, that shit is pointless

[Chorus]
Go tell your friends about it 
Go tell your friends about it 
Go tell 'em what you know, what you seen
How I roll, how I get it on the low
Go tell your friends about it 
Go tell your friends about it
I'm that nigga with the hair
Singin' 'bout poppin' pills, fuckin' bitches, livin' life so trill

[Intro]
Yeah

[Verse 1]
I've been tryna call
I've been on my own for long enough
Maybe you can show mehowto love, maybe
I'mgoing through withdrawals
You don't even haveto do too much
You can turn me on with just a touch, baby

[Pre-Chorus]
I look around and
Sin City's cold and empty 
No one's around to judge me 
I can't see clearly when you're gone

[Chorus]
I said, ooh, I'm blinded by the lights
No, I can't sleep until I feel your touch
I said, ooh, I'm drowning in the night
Oh, when I'm like this, you're the one I trust
Hey, hey, hey

[Verse 2]
I'm running out of time
'Cause I can see the sun light up the sky
So I hit the road in overdrive, baby, oh

[Pre-Chorus]
The city's cold and empty 
No one's around to judge me 
I can't see clearly when you're gone

[Chorus]
I said, ooh, I'm blinded by the lights
No, I can't sleep until I feel your touch
I said, ooh, I'm drowning in the night
Oh, when I'm like this, you're the one I trust

[Bridge]
I'm just coming back to let you know 
I could never say it on the phone 
Will never let you go this time 

[Chorus]
I said, ooh, I'm blinded by the lights
No, I can't sleep until I feel your touch
Hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey

[Outro]
I said, ooh, I'm blinded by the lights
No, I can't sleep until I feel your touch

[Verse 1]
I guess you had no idea that you could have persuaded me
Girl, you could have had me doing anything you pleased
Girl, you should have took your time and thought of what to say to me
'Cause I'm not as hard as I make it seem to be

[Chorus]
And it could have went so many ways
So many ways it can go
'Cause ain't nobody feels the way that I feel when I'm alone
So if I said that I won't call
The lying comes natural to me
You probably could have had it all
You could have been that lonely star
If we just went on 
If we just went on 
If we just went on 
If we just went on 

[Verse 2]
Happiness exists when you don't know a thing
So I hope you don't think this song is about you
And only I can know how close you came
But baby I'm a pro at letting go
I love it when they come and go

[Chorus]
It could have went so many ways
So many ways it can go
'Cause ain't nobody feels the way that I feel when I'm alone
So if I said that I won't call
The lying comes natural to me
You probably could have had it all
You could have been that lonely star
If we just went on 
If we just went on 
If we just went on 
If we just went on 
If we just went on 
If we just went on 
If we just went on 
If we just went on

[Verse 1]
You make it look like it's magic 
'Cause I see nobody, nobody but you, you, you
I'm never confused
Hey, hey
I'm so used to bein' used

So I love when you call unexpected
'Cause I hate when the moment's expected
So I'ma care for you, you, you
I'ma care for you, you, you, you, yeah

'Cause girl, you're perfect
You're always worth it
And you deserve it
The way you work it

So you don't pay it, don't pay it no mind, mind, mind
We live with no lies

On that lonely night 
We said it wouldn't be love
But we felt the rush 
It made us believe it was only us 
Convinced we were broken inside, yeah, inside, yeah

[Chorus]

You're always worth it 
And you deserve it 
The way you work it 
'Cause girl, you earned it, yeah

[Intro]
I'm fucking gone right now
I'm fucking gone right now
"Listen, listen"

[Verse 1]
From the morning to the evening
Complaints from the tenants
Got the walls kicking like they six months pregnant
Drinking Aliz with our cereal for breakfast
Girls calling cabs at dawn quarter to seven
Sky's getting cold, we're flying from the north
Rockin with our city like a sold out show
House full of pros that specialize in the ho'in
Make that money rain as they taking off they clothes
Order plane tickets
Cali is the mission
Visit every month like I'm split life living
Let the world listen
If a hater's caught slipping
Then my niggas stay tight
Got my back like Pippen
Fast life gripping
Yeah, we still tippin'
Codeine cups paint a picture so vivid
Fakes try to mimic
Get girls timid
But behind closed doors they get poles so rigid

[Chorus]
All that money, the money is the motive
All that money, the money is the motive
All that money, the money she be folding
Girl put in work, girl, girl put in work
Girl put in work, girl, girl put in work
Girl put in work

[Verse 2]
Push it to the limit
Push it through the pain
I push it for the pleasure like a virgin to the game
A virgin to that money
A virgin to the fame
So this my only chance
And when I'm over only pray
That I flow from the bottom
Closer to the top
The higher that I climb
The harder I'ma drop
These pussy ass niggas tryna hold on to their credit
So I tell them use a debit
Watch they image start to lessen
I warn them like discretion
Why these niggas testing?
Always fucking testing
Why these niggas testing?
Shit that I got them on straight bar hopping
To the music of the ambiance
Get shit popping
Zombies of the night 
Niggas ain't talking if they hyping to the crew
Get it in like pockets
Downtown loving
When the moon coming
Only place to find bassheads and hot women

[Chorus]
All that money, the money is the motive
All that money, the money is the motive
All that money, the money she be folding
Girl put in work, girl, girl put in work
Girl put in work, girl, girl put in work
Girl put in work

[Verse 3]
Better slow down
She'll feel it in the morning
Ain't the kind of girl you'll be seeing in the morning
Too damn raw ain't no nigga with her rollin
Ain't no nigga that she holding
Man, her love is too damn foreign
Look at all that money
The money is the motive 
All that money
The money she be folding 
Girl put in work, girl, girl put in work
Girl put in work, girl, girl put in work

[Chorus]
All that money, the money is the motive
All that money, the money is the motive
All that money, the money she be folding
Girl put in work, girl, girl put in work
Girl put in work, girl, girl put in work
Girl put in work[Directed by Abel Tesfaye]

Whoa, all these broken hearts on that pole
Man, if pole dancing's an art, you know how many fuckin' artists I know?
Got some new bills in the mail, got some big favors I owe
Got some good things ahead of me when these bad bitches let go
Well girl let's go, walk your broken heart through that door
Sit your sexy ass on that couch
Wipe that lipstick off of your mouth
I take it slow
She in love with my crew
She said make enough so I can try some
I thought taking drugs just ain't you, be you
Yeah girl, just be you
And I do this shit for my hometown, it been going down, it ain't new
That's that north north, that up top
That OVO and that XO
Your girlfriend at our next show
But it's all good, don't stress though
First night fuck, never really planned it
Take a deep breath, no one need to panic
Lips so French, ass so Spanish
She don't really like attention, I don't know if she gon' manage out here
But she got me all up in my zone
Said she like the view I got in this place, shit I did all of that on my own
Aw yeah

[Verse 1]
Baby you're no good
Cause they warned me 'bout your type girl, I've been ducking left and right
Baby you're no good
Think I fell for you, I fell for you, I fell for you

[Pre-Chorus]
You got me puttin' time in, time in
Nobody got me feeling this way
You probably think I'm lying, lying
I'm used to bitches comin' right 'way

[Chorus]
You got me touchin' on your body
You got me touchin' on your body
To say that we're in love is dangerous
But girl I'm so glad we're acquainted, oh

I know I'd rather be complacent
But girl I'm so glad we're acquainted
We're acquainted

But really if I could

But ever since I met you 
I couldn't believe what you did
So comfort me babe, ain't no rush from me babe


[Chorus]
I'll keep on touchin' on your body

I got you touchin' on your body 
I got you touchin' on your body 
I know I'd rather be complacent
But girl I'm so glad we're acquainted
We're acquainted

[Outro]
I'm not tryna talk at all
Tryna love you crazy
Put some more inside your cup
And drink till you numb the pain
I got you touchin' on your body
These girls keep touchin' on their body
They got accustomed to the life we live
These girls born in the '90s are dangerous
I got 'em thinkin' that they want me
Although they know they not the only
I got 'em wanting to embrace their sins
These girls born in the '90s are dangerous

[Verse 1]
All alone, she was livin'
In a world without an end or beginnin'
Baby girl was livin' life for the feelin'
But I don't mind, I don't mind, oh
And all the wrongs she committed
She was numb and she was so co-dependent
She was young and all she had was the city
But I don't mind, I don't mind

[Pre-Chorus]
And I know 
That she's capable of anything, it's riveting
But when 
You wake up she's always gone, gone, gone, oh

[Chorus]
In the night she hears him calling
In the night she's dancin' to relieve the pain
She'll never walk away
I don't think you understand
In the night when she comes crawlin'
Dollar bills and tears keep fallin' down her face
She'll never walk away
I don't think you understand

[Verse 2]
He sang a song when he did it
He was cold and he was so unforgiving
Now she dances to the song on the minute
Yeah, all the time , all the time , oh
It make her weak when she hear it
And it got her on her knees like religion
She was young and she was forced to be a woman
Yeah, all the time , all the time 

[Pre-Chorus]
And I know 
That she's capable of anything, it's riveting
But when 
You wake up she's always gone, gone, gone, oh

[Chorus]
In the night she hears him calling
In the night she's dancin' to relieve the pain
She'll never walk away
I don't think you understand
In the night when she comes crawlin' 
Dollar bills and tears keep fallin' down her face 
She'll never walk away
I don't think you understand

[Bridge]
Oh baby
I don't think you understand 
I don't think you understand 
I don't think you understand
Oh no, no, no
I don't think you understand 

[Chorus]
In the night she hears him calling 
In the night she's dancin' to relieve the pain 
She'll never walk away 
I don't think you understand
In the night when she comes crawlin' 
Dollar bills and tears keep fallin' down her face 
She'll never walk away
I don't think you understand

[Verse 1]
I'm addied up, add it up
I just ate a plate for breakfast
Put it in a cup, then I mix it up with Texas
Chest feeling heavy like a midget on my necklace
Bitches that we came with got all of your bitches jealous 
'Bout to leave the crib with a couple of my pirates
Driving by the streets we used to walk through like a triumph
Mix it in a potion like a science
That liquid G diet got a nigga so quiet
Cause the shit so strong, got me feeling like I'm dying
The shit so raw, nothing else can get me higher
Only time you see me's when I'm balling with my niggas
Cause my life too private, my ride too private 
My flight too private, my shows so riot
My jaw so tired, I go all night in my city 'til the Fall
Then it's time for me to fly out
I got a girl at home even though she ain't mine yet

[Chorus]
And she gon' give it up cause she know I might like it
She gon' give it up cause she know I might like it
She gon' give it up cause she know I might like it
She gon' give it up cause she know I might like it
Baby girl, you know what I like
Baby, you know just what I like
Baby, you know what I like

[Verse 2]
Don't be mad, let her get hers
Don't be mad, let her get hers
She make her own luck, she don't give a fuck
She trying to have fun, take a break from the love
Man, your girl so bad, let me get her
Your girl so bad, let me get her
I make my own luck, I make that pussy talk
On call to the fall, he can like it or not
Nigga, back the fuck up
If you aint with me, motherfucker, you against me
If you aint complimenting, nigga, you offending
I been out here last year wasting hella time
XO is the only time invested
Them Fall shows every year like a birthday
And I'ma do it every year in my birthplace
And I aint been this gone since Thursday
I never said that Id be sober in the first place

[Chorus]
And she gon' give it up cause she know I might like it
She gon' give it up cause she know I might like it
She gon' give it up cause she know I might like it
She gon' give it up cause she know I might like it
Baby girl, you know what I like
Baby, you know just what I like
Baby, you know what I like

[Break]
Baby girl, you know what I like
Baby, you know just what I like, mm

[Verse 3]
I just passed that "nigga fell off" stage
Just sold out the O2 at my own pace
I can say that Im attached to nobody
I've been getting paper while these niggas tryna stop me
Shout my nigga Doc, thats a mentor
Had some bad business, nothing personal
But now the word out that we back
On some young Quincy Jones, dark skin Michael Jackson
And these the motherfuckers that they packaged
Their new shit all be sounding like my past shit
Bring your girl to my show, give her floor seats
Then she go downtown like she owe me
XO, XO, XO
Mix it up, pour it up, take it down slow
This is my sound, nigga, fuck your sound
Did it from the ground, ask around, bitch
When I touch down, I'ma shake shit up
Fuck your new man, I'ma break it up
He can come back when I go on the road
But that pussy mine for the next three months
Cause the kid back, kid back, kid back
Cop ten whips for my niggas when we land
Queen Street nigga making money overseas
Had a few more debts, I'ma pay it all in cash
Shout out XO, shout out to the boy who
Broke bread on tour, man, its all over now
Shout my nigga Stix, doing good in these streets
Bet he popping more bottles than us right now
Reason why they stressing, city never sunny
When the kid come through with more niggas than Apollo
But aint shit funny, cant nobody stop me
All my hoes are trained, I make all of them swallow

[Outro]
All of them swallow
All of them swallow
All of them swallow
I make all of them swallow
All of them swallow
All of them swallow
All of them swallow
I make all of them swallow
All of them swallow
All of them swallow
All of them swallow
I make all of them swallow
All of, all of
All of them swallow
All of them swallow
I make all of them swallow[Part I]

[Verse 1]
When I got on stage, she swore I was six feet tall
But when she put it in her mouth
She can't seem to reach my
Ballin' ain't an issue for me
I'll make a hundred stacks right back next week
Do it all again, I'm faded off the wrong thing, the wrong thing
And I'll admit, baby, I'm a little camera-shy
But exceptions can be made, baby, cause you're too damn fly
For what it's worth, I hope you enjoy the show
'Cause if you're back here only takin' pictures
You gon' have to take your ass home

[Bridge]
'Cause the only thing you're takin' is your clothes off
Go 'head, girl, strip it down, close your mouth
I just wanna hear your body talk

[Hook]


Oh girl, dont hold back, let it out


Oh girl, dont hold back, let it out


Dont hold back, let it out


Dont hold back

[Verse 2]
You can meet me in the room where the kisses ain't free
You gotta pay with your body
Not really into kisses leading into nothing
I'm into shows every night, if you play your cards right
I might fuck around, bring your whole crew on tour
Fuck around, turn you to my West Coast girl
Until they book a show in NYC
Gotta fly back east where the city don't sleep
Woah, I'm tryna finish all this potion
Baby, take your time, tryna sip it 'til the mornin'
And if you're still up, I'm tryna fuck you in the mornin'
Said I'm two days strong
And never sleep until it's mornin', until the mornin'

[Bridge]
'Cause the only thing you're takin' is your clothes off
Go 'head, girl, strip it down, close your mouth
I just wanna hear your body talk

[Hook]


Oh yeah, dont hold back, let it out


Oh girl, dont hold back, let it out


Dont hold back, let it out


Oh yeah, dont hold back

[Part II]

[Verse 3]
I got a brand new place, I think I've seen it twice all year
I can't remember how it looks inside
So you can picture how my life's been
I went from starin' at the same four walls for 21 years
To seein' the whole world in just 12 months
Been gone for so long I might have just found God
Well, probably not, if I keep my habits up
Probably not if I can't keep up with lovin'
And I can't stand talkin' to brand new girls
Only bitches down to fuck when you shower them with ones
Probably not if my niggas round them up
Probably not if we take 'em to my spot
Probably not if I tweak all day just to sleep at night
Goddamn, I'm high
My doctor told me to stop
And he gave me somethin' to pop
And I mix it up with some Adderall's
And I wait to get to the top
And I mix it up with some alcohol and I pour it up in a shot
I don't care about you, why you worried 'bout me?
All I want is that smoke, give me all of that smoke
Last week was my rough week
I'm still drippin' down from my nose
And I don't know how to drive, I make my driver get high
But If he goes under that 110, believe my driver get fired
And I don't got any friends, I got XO in my bloodwork
And I'm posted up down in Florida,
Ft. Lauderdale to that MIA
Cold drinks with Grand Marnier
To the break of dawn, Kahlua milk
White Russian when the sun hits
White Russians with tongue tricks
I like the feeling of tongue rings
She like the way my whole tongue flip
She grind hard for tuition
She grind hard 'til her teeth chip
I make her hide it with gold grills
I make her suck it with gold grills
In the back room of the VIP, she don't ever sleep

[Outro]
This ain't nothing to relate to
This ain't nothing to relate to
This ain't nothing to relate to
This ain't nothing to relate to
Even if you tried, you tried, you tried
You tried, you tried, you tried
You tried, you tried, you tried
You tried, you tried, you tried
This ain't nothing to relate to
This ain't nothing to relate to
This ain't nothing to relate to
This ain't nothing to relate to
Even if you tried, you tried, you tried
You tried, you tried, you tried
You tried, you tried, you tried
You tried, you tried, you tried

[Intro]
Ooh
Yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse 1]
Now you're thinkin' 'bout it
Girl you're thinkin' 'bout it
What we got here
How we fuckin' got here
They recognized
They just recognize
I'm in a life without a home so this recognition's not enough
I don't care about nobody else
Cause I've been on these streets way too long, too long, too long
Baby, I've been on this too long

[Verse 2]
'Cause getting faded too long
Got me on this rolling stone
So I take another hit
Kill another serotonin
With a hand full of beans
And a chest full of weed
Got me singing bout a bitch
While I'm blowing out my steam
Yeah, I know I got my issues
Why you think I fuckin' flow?
And I'ma keep on smoking 'til I can't hit another note

[Chorus]
Ooh, but until then
I got you, ooh
Baby, I got you, ooh
Until you're used to my face
And my mystery fades
I got you, ooh

[Verse 3]
So, baby, love me, oh
Before they all love me
Until you won't love me, oh
Because they'll all love me, ooh
I'll be different, oh
I think I'll be different, ooh
I hope I'm not different, oh
And I hope you'll still listen

[Chorus]
But until then
Baby, I got you, ooh
I got you, oh, ohh
Girl, I still got you, oh-ohh
And I got you, ooh, woah

Knew you were special from the moment I saw you
I saw you, yeah

I feel you're closer every time I call you
I call you

[Pre-Chorus: The Weeknd]
Cause all I see are wings, I can see your wings
But I know what I am and the life I live, yeah, the life I live
And even though I sin, maybe we are born to live
But I know time will tell if we're meant for this
Yeah, if we're meant for this

Yeah, no emotions baby

[Pre-Chorus: The Weeknd]
Cause all I see are wings, I can see your wings

And even though I sin, we all want to live

A dangerously empty life
You always seem to bring the light

And even though we live inside
A dangerously empty life
You always seem to bring me light
You always seem to bring me light

I don't wanna hurt you, but you live for the pain

Any time for you to get my call, baby 
Are you alone, baby?
If he ain't around, pick up your phone, baby
Whoa

Can you try me? , try me 
Once you put your pride aside
You can notify me , -fy me 
You're the best I ever had
Baby girl, remind me , -mind me 
Let me know if it's on
And you know where to find me, find me
Havin' thoughts you never had, yeah

[Verse]
I didn't know you were down for him finding out
I thought you had some kind of love for your man
Well, I'm not tryna break up something
You've been workin' out, you've been steady
But I'm ready to go all the way if you let me
Don't you tempt me
You're lookin' grown since the last time I looked at you
It might have been, been about a couple months
But I just got the picture that you texted to me
You ain't steady, you look ready to go all the way
If you let me take you down on me

[Chorus]
Can you try me? , try me 
Once you put your pride aside 
You can notify me , -fy me 
You're the best I ever had

Enjoy your privileged life
'Cause I'm not gonna hold you through the night
We said our last goodbyes
So, let's just try to end it with a smile

[Pre-Chorus]
And I don't wanna hear that you are suffering
You are suffering no more
'Cause I held you down when you were suffering
You were suffering

[Chorus]
Blues away, way, way
I got two red pills to take the blues away
Blues away, way, way
I got two red pills to take the blues away

[Bridge]
And I'ma fuck the pain away, and I know I'll be okay
They said our love is just a game, I don't care what they say
But I'ma drink the pain away, I'll be back to my old ways
And I got two red pills to take the blues away, oh

[Outro]
I don't wanna hear that no more, no more
No more, no more
I don't wanna hear that no more

[Verse 1: The Weeknd]
Ask around about her
She don't get emotional
Kill off all her feelings
That's why she ain't approachable
She know her pussy got a fanbase
A couple niggas with a suitcase
Suit and tie niggas who play roleplay
When it comes to money she play no games

[Pre-Chorus: The Weeknd]
She lick it up just like a candy
She wanna make them leave their family
She trying to live a life so fancy
She wanna pull up in a Bentley
She ain't got time for lovin'
Louis Vuitton her husband
She rather die in lusting
She rather die in the club, 'til she

[Chorus: The Weeknd & Future]
Six feet under she gon' get that fucking paper
Six feet under she gon' get that fucking paper
Six feet under she gon' get that fucking paper
You know how she get down, pop it for a check now
Six feet under, six, six feet under
Six feet under, six, six feet under
Six feet under she gon' kill me for that paper
Not the type to fuck around, gonna turn that ass around

[Verse 2: The Weeknd]
She don't depend on anybody
Know just what to do with her own body
Counting all that money like a hobby
She don't give a fuck about nobody
And she got her whole crew poppin'
And she bend it over like she got no back bone
Got a couple niggas blinging up a trap phone
She don't need nobody waiting back home, she got it

[Pre-Chorus: The Weeknd]
She lick it up just like a candy
She wanna make them leave their family
She trying to live a life so fancy
She wanna pull up in a Bentley
She ain't got time for lovin'

[Post-Chorus: Future]
Gonna turn that ass around
Oh murder, oh murder
Gonna turn that ass around

[Bridge: The Weeknd]
Real love's hard to find
So she don't waste her time
So she don't waste her time, oooh
You ain't gon' catch her crying
She ain't gon' lose her mind
She ain't gon' lose her mind
'Til she..

[Outro: Future & The Weeknd]
Six feet under she gon' kill me for that paper 
Six feet under she gon' kill me for that paper 
Six feet under she gon' kill me for the paper
Not the type to fuck around, gonna turn that ass around[Part I: The Party]

[Part II: The After Party]

[Verse 1: The Weeknd]
I think I'm fucking gone, rolling on this floor
Messing up your carpet
I'll get on it after four more
Sessions of the strong on your floor
Should have fucking rolled, but I fucking pulled
Feeling like a million bucks before
I walked through this door
When I walked through your door
Can't believe I made it
But I made it that's for sure
For sure
Your loving
I need more
I need yours
She ain't looking for that unconditional
What the fuck these bitches on?
They want what I'm sitting on
They don't want my love
They just want my potential
Fuck it
I'll be sipping on this, baby, living off bliss
Got me drowning in your love
Got me drowning in the mist
Gimme right attention
Or I'll start drowning from my wrist
Baby, if you knew
The feeli'g I would give to

[Chorus: The Weeknd]
You
Oh, you
You
Oh, you
Cause I got it, girl
Oh, I got it, girl
With me
With me
Whoa, you
Whoa, you
Whoa, you
Whoa, you
Oh, I got it, girl
Oh, I got it, girl
With me, with me

[Verse 2: The Weeknd]
I, I got a brand new girl
Call her Rudolph
She'll probably O.D. before I show her to momma
All these girls try to tell me she got no love
But all these girls never ever got her blowjob
Ringtone on silent
And if she stops, then I might get violent
No call is worth stopping
So, momma please stop calling
We can play all night
It just takes one night
To let me fucking prove
This feeli'g I would give to

[Chorus: The Weeknd]
You
Oh, you
You
Oh, you
Oh, I got it, girl
Well, I got it, girl
With me, with me
With me
Whoa, you
Whoa, you
Whoa, you
Oh, I got it, girl
Yeah, I got it, girl
With me, with me

[Outro: The Weeknd]
Oh, ooh
Oh, ooh
Oh, I got it, girl

[Verse 1]
This house is not a home to you
But you decide to go ahead and lay down, lay down
There are no words to describe the depth of your indifference
Cause I see youre here to stay
Shouldve known to pick my fate

[Chorus]
Im so wrong, Im so wrong

To let you in my home

Now you know where I sleep


[Verse 2]
Hey there, lonely girl
Did you have to tell your friends
About  the way I got you screaming my name?
Did you have to tell the world?
Now your girls all wanna fuck
Girl you couldve been the one
Gotta change my number twice a month
When you could have simply kept it on the down low

[Chorus]
Im so wrong, Im so wrong

To let you in my home

Now you know where I sleep


[Verse 3]
Baby if I knew youd be living in my sheets
I wouldnt have shown you any love
I would have left you in the club
You said you dont belong
You keep saying theres no one
And theres no where to go
But who keeps calling on your phone?
Im so wrong, Im so wrong, Im so wrong

[Chorus]
Im so wrong, Im so wrong

To let you in my home

Now you know where I sleep

Im so wrong, Im so wrong

To let you in my home

Now you know where I sleep

Girl, if your man call your phone again
Girl, if your man call your phone again[Produced by The Weeknd, Noah Detail Fisher, Beyonc Knowles, Timbaland, Jerome Harmon, BOOTS and Andre Proctor]

[Verse 1]
I've been mixin', I've been sippin'
Since I been 20, on that lean, baby girl
I've been poppin', and I've been rollin'
Since I was 17, I've been geekin' on that water
I want you, now now
I'm not tryna fuck tomorrow baby I want you, now now
Don't take my number, don't want your number
I'll call you back if that head right baby
I won't love you, I can't love you
Unless that pussy got some super powers
I want you, now now
I'm not trying to fuck tomorrow baby I want you, now now

[Chorus]
And I woke up in the kitchen saying
"How the hell did this shit happen?"
Oh baby, drunk in love
We be all night
The last thing I remember is your beautiful body grindin' in the club
Drunk in love
We be all night, love, baby, love
We be all night, love, baby, love

[Verse 2]
Wanna fuck a skinny model right before her runway show
She the one in the back, nose running from the blow
And we did it on the floor, that's why she walkin' kind of funny
Should've never put us on, bitch I'm only 24
And everybody salty, niggas stop your bitchin'
Everybody makin' money, we don't need to kick it
I'm chillin' with my niggas, everybody got a crib
Did an album just to do it, droppin' albums like a pill
Percocets, Adderall, ecstasy, pussy, money, weed
Faded for a week, I don't sleep, fuck my enemies
Try to stay sane is like a full-time hobby
Everything I do, fake niggas always copy
All I want to do is go on tour and drop albums
And if I live forever, probably drop a hundred thousand
Dick made out of magic, my tongue got superpowers
I woke up in the mornin', models passed out in the shower

[Chorus]
And I woke up in the kitchen saying
"How the hell did this shit happen?"
Oh baby, drunk in love
We be all night, love, oh yeah, love
We be all night, love, oh yeah, love
We be all night

[Intro]
Oh, oh-ooh
Oh , oh 
Oh, oh

[Verse]
They say my brain meltin'
And the only thing I'll tell 'em is
I'm livin' for the present and the future don't exist
So, baby, take your clothes off, a chance like this
You may never get to show off, show off
Show off what you talking about
Unless you like to tease, baby
When in reality you don't know how to please, baby
Blue-ball queen, take your fuckin' seat, baby
Ride it out, now I know you wanna scream, baby
Better than your next man
And if he swingin' I get dumber than the next man
'Cause I don't play
Unless it's keys, then I play all day 
You like them keys? We gon' play all day 
Wet dream fry your brain all day, all day
I think you lost your morals, girl 
But it's okay 'cause you don't need 'em where we're goin'
In that two-floor loft in the middle of the city
After rollin' through the city with me
I promise you gon' see
That I'm only fuckin' 20, girl
Amnesia, put your mind in a dream world
What you doin' in the bathroom? 
I hear noises in the bathroom 
Baby, it's okay
We can do it in the living room
Twisting turns in 'em, the only girls that we fuck with
Seem to have 20 different pills in 'em
They tell us that they love us
Even though they want a next man
And the next man's bitch want the third man
Eddie Murphy shit, yeah, we trade places
Rehearse lines to them and then we fuck faces
Yeah, we know just how to get a buzz
Mix it with the hash, come fuck with us
I'm raw, mothafucka, I'm raw
My love so lost, and my niggas, man
These bitches can't touch what we got if they wanted
I'll plug any nigga that'll step
Man, I got 'em, yeah, I got 'em
'Til the ending of our credits
Life's such a movie, filmed independent, us against the city
Please don't get offended when we don't answer your calls
And if you got a problem, come and find us, we can talk about it
What's good, young ho? You about it?
Got a loft right now, you excited?
You excited

[Outro]
Ooh, ooh
Ah, ah
Ooh-ahh

Ahh, ahh, ahh, ooh
Ooh-ahh, ahh, ahh
Ooh, oh no, no, no
Ahh, ahh-ooh, ooh[Part I: House of Balloons]

[Verse 1]
Been on another level since you came, no more pain
You look into my eyes, you can't recognize my face
You're in my world now, you can stay, you can stay
But you belong to me, ooh, you belong to me

[Chorus]
If it hurts to breathe, open a window 
Oh, your mind wants to leave , but you can't go
Oh, this is a happy house 
We're happy here 
In a happy house
Oh this is fun, fun, fun, fun
Fun, fun, fun, fun
Fun, fun, fun, fun

[Verse 2]
Music got you lost
Nights pass so much quicker than the days did
Same clothes, you ain't ready for your day shift
This place will burn you up
But, baby, it's okay, them my niggas next door
And they working in the trap, so get naughty if you want
So don't blame it on me that you didn't call your home
So don't blame it on me, girl, 'cause you wanted to have fun

[Chorus]
If it hurts  to breathe
Open a window 
Oh, your mind wants to leave but you can't go 
This is a happy house
We're happy here in a happy house
Oh this is fun, fun, fun, fun 
Fun, fun, fun, fun 
Fun, fun, fun, fun

[Segue]
Bring the 707 out
Bring the 707 out
Bring the 707 out
Bring the 707 out
Bring the 707 out
Bring the 7

[Verse 3]
Two puffs for the lady who be down for that
Whatever, together
Bring your own stash of the greatest, trade it
Roll a dub, burn a dub, cough a dub, taste it
Then watch us chase it
With a handful of pills, no chasers
Jaw clenching on some super-sized papers
And she bad and her head bad
Escaping, her van is a Wonderland
And it's half-past six
Read skies 'cause time don't exist
But when the stars shine back to the crib
Superstar lines back at the crib
And we can test out the tables
We got some brand new tables
All glass and it's four feet wide
But it's a must to get us ten feet high
She give me sex in a handbag
I get her wetter than a wet nap
And no closed doors
So I listen to her moans echo
"I heard he do drugs now"
You heard wrong, I been on it for a minute
We just never act a fool, that's just how we fuckin' live it
And when we act a fool, it's probably 'cause we mixed it
Yeah, I'm always on that okey dokey
Them white boys know the deal, ain't no fuckin' phony
Big O know the deal, he the one who showed me
Watch me ride this fucking beat like he fuckin' told me
"Is that your girl, what's her fucking story?"
"She kinda bad but she ride it like a fucking pony"
I cut down on her man, be her fuckin' story
Yeah, I'm talking 'bout you, man, get to know me
Ain't no offense, though, I promise you
If you a real man, dude, you gon' decide the truth
But I'm a nice dude with some nice dreams
And we could turn this to a nightmare: Elm Street

[Outro]
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
I'm so gone, so gone
Bring out the glass tables 
Bring the 707 out
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la

Bring out the glass tables 
Bring the 707 out
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la

[Verse 1]
Oh, yeah, got you drinking out them white cups, sodas
All this shit so foreign to you, thick smoke, choking
Baby, get familiar with the order
Just crack it, then pour it, then sip slow, then tip low
My eyes red but my brim low, that XO
She climbing, straight to the top, forgetting why she there in the first place
No more crying, heart rate slow, put that rum down you don't wanna die tonight
I promise, when youre finished, well head to where Im living
The party wont finish, its a fucking celebration, oh yeah
For my niggas out tonight
And they high off Shakespeare lines
There's enough to pass around, you don't gotta wait in line
And the clocks don't work, you don't gotta check the time
And the blinds don't work, you don't gotta check the sky
We'll be going all night, 'til light

[Hook]
I got a test for you
You say you want my heart
Well, baby, you can have it all
There's just something that I need from you
Is to meet my boys

[Verse 2]
And you've been going hard, baby
Now you rolling with some big boys, baby
Got a lot you wanna show off, baby
Close that door before you take your fucking clothes off, baby
Don't mind, all my writings on the wall
I thought I passed my peak, and I'm experiencing fall
And all I wanna do is leave cause I've been zoning for a week
And I ain't left this little room, tryna concentrate to breathe
Cause this piff so potent, killing serotonin
In that two floor loft in the middle we be choking
On that all black voodoo, heavy gum chewing
Go on if you thirsty, baby, if you dancing
Grab a cup of that XO, baby, I been leaning
Back from the come down, girl, I've been fiending
For another round, don't you blame it on me
When you're grinding up your teeth and it's fucking hard to sleep

[Hook]
I got a test for you
You said you want my heart
Well, baby, you can have it all
There's just something that I need from you
Is to meet my boys
I got a lot of boys
And we can make you right
And if you get too high

[Verse 3]
Baby, come over here and
Ride it out, ride it out
Work that butt 'til I tire out
Roll that weed, bring that fire out
Taste that lean when you kiss my mouth
Bed so wet when I eat you out
Girl's friends scream that I'm creeping out
If they're not down, better keep em out
Ex-man hollering, keep him out
Hard to let go, I could teach you how
Take a puff of this motherfucking reefer now
Bet a shot of this cognac, ease you out
Just one night, trying to fucking leave you out
Baby, baby

[Hook]
I got a test for you
You said you want my heart
Well, baby, you can have it all
There's just something I need from you
Is to meet my boys
I got a lot of boys
And we can make you right
And if you get too high
Baby, come over here and ride it out
Ooh, yeah, ooh, yeah, ooh, yeah
Come over here and ride it out
Ooh, yeah, ooh, yeah, ooh, yeah
Ooh yeah, ooh

That north north, that up top, that OVO and that XO
That north north, that up top, that OVO and that XO
That north north, that up top, that OVO and that XO
That north north, that up top, that OVO and that XO

[Verse 1: Ed Sheeran]
Waking up, half past five
Blood on pillow and one bruised eye
Drunk too much, you know what I'm like
But you shoulda seen the other guy

[Pre-Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
This ain't the right time for you to fall in love with me
Well baby, I'm just being honest
And I know my lies could not make you believe
We're running in circles, that's why

[Chorus 1: Ed Sheeran]
In my dark times, I'll be going back to the street
Promising everything I do not mean
In my dark time, baby, this is all I could be
And only my mother can love me for me
In my dark time
In my dark time

[Verse 2: The Weeknd]
Light one up, let me bum a smoke
Still coming down, dripping throat
I got another man's blood on my clothes
But it ain't his fault, it's the life I chose

[Pre-Chorus: The Weeknd]
This ain't the right time for you to fall in love with me
My baby, I'm just being honest
And I know my lies can never make you believe
Running in circles, that's why

[Chorus 2: The Weeknd]
In my dark times, I'll be going back to these streets
Promising everything I do not mean
In my dark times, maybe this is all I could be
Only my mother could love me for me
In my dark times
In my dark times

[Verse 3: Ed Sheeran & The Weeknd]
In my dark times I've still got some problems, I know
Driving too fast but just moving too slow
And I've got something I've been trying to let go
Pulling me back every time

[Chorus 3: Ed Sheeran & The Weeknd]
In my dark times taking it back to the street
Making those promises that I could not keep
In my dark times, baby this is all I could be
Only my mother could love me for me
In my dark time taking it down to the street
Making those promises that I would never keep
In my dark time this is all I could be
Only my mother could love me for me
In my dark times
In my dark time
In my dark times

[Verse 1]
Bathroom stalls for the powder nose 
High heel shoes with the open toes 
She's got a good time wrapped in gold  
For you, for you
All red dress with the devil eyes 
So obsessed with the camera lights 
You love her, but you can't deny 
The truth, the truth

[Pre-Chorus]
She loves everybody
Can't you tell by the signs?
She loves everybody
She gets off all the time
It's a dark philosophy
And it haunts her constantly
It's a false alarm to me
She's a false alarm

[Chorus]
False alarm 
False alarm 
False alarm 
False alarm 
False alarm 
False alarm 

[Verse 2]
Six inch long, 'bout three inch wide 
Dolla, dolla bill is her only type 
You love her but you'll never be 
The one, the one
Diamonds and the rings are her fantasy 
She chase hearts with the Hennessy 
You love her, but you'll never be 
Enough, enough

[Pre-Chorus]
She loves everybody
Can't you tell by the signs?
She loves everybody
She gets off all the time
It's a dark philosophy
And it haunts her constantly
She's a false alarm to me
She's a false alarm

[Chorus]
False alarm 
False alarm 
False alarm 
False alarm 
False alarm 
False alarm 

[Bridge]
She always leaves the man she loves
But the diamonds are forever
She always seems to be alone
But the diamonds make it better

[Chorus]
False alarm 
False alarm 
False alarm 
False alarm 
False alarm 
False alarm 

[Verse 1]
Woah
She popped that pussy on a Monday
She never falls in love
But she heard me in the club, she couldn't run
She wanna give me all her money
She used to spend it all alone cause her man went and did her wrong, so she
But baby I'm not tryin' to be the one
I got my baby waitin' home
She been too good to let that go
And I ain't tryna win your heart
And you can't pay to win my love
So keep dancin', baby, keep dancin', dancin'
Keep dancin', dancin', keep dancin'

[Pre-Hook]

I know, yes, I know

Don't make me pop your cheap ass pills
I used to do this for the thrill, yeah
I know you got a lot to lose
But ain't nobody here but me
So baby what you got to prove, yeah

On the pole, on the floor, you're alone
But there ain't nothing I can do
So keep dancin', baby, keep dancin', dancin'
Keep dancin', dancin', keep dancin'

[Pre-Chorus]
So if I love you
It'd be just for you
So when I'm touching you
Can I trust in you?
Can I trust in you? Oh babe

[Chorus]
Girl, come show me your true colors

True colors, true colors
Girl, come show me your true colors

True colors, true colors

[Verse 2]
What's done is done
Now that I'm the only one

And I don't believe all this inconsistency
I've been hearing different stories about you

[Pre-Chorus]
So if I love you

I don't mean to be so uptight
But my heart's been hurt a couple times
By a couple guys that didn't treat me right

'Cause I'm tired of the fake love
Show me what you're made of
Boy, make me believe

[Intro: Bebe Rexha & Lil Wayne]
I'm sorry, I'm not the most pretty
I'll never ever sing like Whitney
Ooh, but I still wanna dance with somebody 

[Verse 1: Bebe Rexha & Lil Wayne]
So lets let our hearts bleed, 'til they turn to rust
Gonna live it up, 'cause it's dangerous

But I could never ever dance like Bobby
You can dance, I'ma watch your body
I just wanna stand right behind it
I just want a chance with somebody
Pop a couple xans with somebody
Every time she dance it's exotic
Throw a bunch of bands arms get tired
I'm the God I just want a goddess
Gotta use a bedroom for a closet
Got a whole bedroom, on the private
I know her body inside, out science
Kiss both boobs right before I sign 'em
Can't dance but kinda grind 'em
Yeah, I be right behind her, spinal
We can turn this dance floor to a island

[Chorus: Bebe Rexha & Lil Wayne]
I just wanna dance with somebody

It could be anybody, tell me, are you that somebody?

No, I don't wanna play the part
I just wanna dance with somebody

I just wanna dance with somebody 
I just wanna dance with somebody
It could be anybody, tell me, are you that somebody?

Don't matter who you are, just love me the way I are

I just wanna dance with somebody
I just wanna dance with somebody
I just wanna dance with somebody
It could be anybody, tell me, are you that somebody?
Don't matter who you are, just love me the way I are
I just wanna dance with somebody
I just wanna dance with somebody

I never know, I never know what to believe in
And it's getting old, it's getting old
But no hard feelings
'Cause friends come and go, friends come and go without a reason
And I, I've been in L.A. for way too long
Can't get this air inside my lungs
It feels like I'm suffocatin' from all the lack of the realness here

[Pre-Chorus: Bebe Rexha]
Is there anybody real out here?
Got my middle, middle up while I'm singing

[Chorus: Bebe Rexha]
Fuck fake friends
We don't need 'em
Only thing they're good for is leaving
Fuck fake friends
We don't need 'em
I've had it up to the ceiling
Fuck fake friends
We don't need 'em
Only thing they're good for is leaving
And I ain't got the time, money on my mind
I'll say it to your face, fuck fake friends

[Verse 2: G-Eazy]
And lately I've been dealin' with mad stress
Comes with the territory of a Hollywood address
Is anybody real here?
I need some fact checks
I need more realness, need you to act less
'Cause they deserve Oscars, so many imposters
What's up with guest lists?
Can I come to your concerts?
We all got demons, I'm dealin' with monsters
I've taken every picture, signed titties and signed shirts
But at the same time I know I'm blessed to be here
So let's just be clear
A million kids wish they had the spot I got
Success is not a sandy beach chair
Be careful with the people you meet here, I'm sayin'
Uh, yeah

[Pre-Chorus: Bebe Rexha & ]
Is there anybody real out here? 
Got my middle, middle up while I'm singing 

[Chorus: Bebe Rexha & ]
Fuck fake friends
We don't need 'em
Only thing they're good for is leaving
Fuck fake friends
We don't need 'em
I've had it up to the ceiling
Fuck fake friends
We don't need 'em
Only thing they're good for is leaving
And I ain't got the time, money on my mind
I'll say it to your face, fuck fake friends
 We don't need 'em


[Bridge: Bebe Rexha]
And I ain't got the time, money on my mind
Say it to my face, don't pretend
And I ain't got the time, money on my mind
I'll say it to your face, fuck fake friends
And I ain't got the time, money on my mind
Say it to my face, don't pretend
And I ain't got the time, money on my mind
I'll say it to your face, fuck fake friends

[Pre-Chorus: Bebe Rexha]
Is there anybody real out here?
Got my middle, middle up while I'm singing

[Chorus: Bebe Rexha]
Fuck fake friends
We don't need 'em
Only thing they're good for is leaving
Fuck fake friends
We don't need 'em
I've had it up to the ceiling
Fuck fake friends
We don't need 'em
Only thing they're good for is leaving
And I ain't got the time, money on my mind
I'll say it to your face, fuck fake friends

[Intro: Bebe Rexha + Nicki Minaj]
Oh baby, oh baby, I know that you've been hurtin'

Oh baby, oh baby, I know that you've been hurtin'
I'm Nicki Minaj, that's Bebe, let's go

[Chorus: Bebe Rexha]
No broken hearts in the club, no tears in the club
'Cause we gon' get it poppin' tonight
No broken hearts in the club, more drinks  pour it up!
'Cause we gon' get it poppin' tonight

[Verse 1: Bebe Rexha]
We goin' straight to Miami
Hop on a plane, don't need no plans
Shinin' so hard like a Grammy
Forget all the players what they did
We gon' be buyin' the drinks 
We gon' be buyin' the drinks 
Line up the bottles, line up the models, we gon' forget everything

[Pre-Chorus: Bebe Rexha]
Oh, ai-ain't nobody goin' home, you-you know what you came for
To dance off the pain, don't feel a thing, just feel the champagne
If you're feelin' lonely, better let me hear you sing

[Chorus: Bebe Rexha]
No broken hearts in the club, no tears in the club
'Cause we gon' get it poppin' tonight
No broken hearts in the club, more drinks  pour it up!
'Cause we gon' get it poppin' tonight
We only got one life, so let's go hard 'til the day we die
No broken hearts in the club, more drinks  pour it up!
'Cause we gon' get it poppin' tonight

[Verse 2: Bebe Rexha]
We gonna do it real biggie 
Sky is the limit in this town
We takin' over the city
We too high to bring us down
We gonna do what we do 
We gonna do what we do 
Three in the mornin', four in the mornin', meet you for eggs in the mornin'

[Pre-Chorus: Bebe Rexha]
Oh, ai-ain't nobody goin' home, you-you know what you came for
To dance off the pain, don't feel no shame, just feel the champagne
If you're feelin' lonely, better let me hear you sing

[Chorus: Bebe Rexha]
No broken hearts in the club, no tears in the club
'Cause we gon' get it poppin' tonight
No broken hearts in the club, more drinks  pour it up!
'Cause we gon' get it poppin' tonight
We only got one life, so let's go hard 'til the day we die
No broken hearts in the club, more drinks  pour it up!
'Cause we gon' get it poppin' tonight

[Verse 3: Nicki Minaj]
Yo, ay yo, Bebe, anybody hatin' need a pee-pee
Sip a little Myx, pop pills 'til I'm sleepy
I'm the one that bust it open out in Waikiki
Pull up in the Ghost, I'm creepy
They don't want beef, we proved it
Niggas better keep it on wax like a Q-tip
Keep his dick wetter than the cruise ship
Flower than a tulip, flyer than your new bitch
I do's it, yep, I'm up two zip
Girls is my sons, I'm givin' them milf teas
They be sweatin' me, headbands and gym tees
Like bad knees on Dirk Nowitzki's
It is going down like M. Lewinsky's
Wrist freeze, yep, my wrist on pink skis
Ring finger be shittin' on my pinky's
Make 'em mad, aw, man, I got 'em hatin' bad
Bloodclaat, money green like Jamaican flags

[Chorus: Bebe Rexha]
No broken hearts in the club, no tears in the club
'Cause we gon' get it poppin' tonight
No broken hearts in the club, more drinks  pour it up!
'Cause we gon' get it poppin' tonight
We only got one life, so let's go hard 'til the day we die
No broken hearts in the club, more drinks  pour it up!
'Cause we gon' get it poppin' tonight

Tell me all your secrets
Lookin' like you need it

[Verse 2]
Tell me what you're thinkin'
Always overthinkin'
I just wanna love you, I got you
Don't have to be so guarded
Let's finish what we started
It's all I ever wanted

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause I got you, you, oh
You, I got you, I got you

[Chorus]
We can get high, oh, nah-nah-nah

'Cause I got you
It's true
I'd die for you, I'd die for you
I got you

[Chorus]
We can get high, oh, nah-nah-nah
We can get low, oh, nah-nah-nah
Let me be your friend
Baby, let me in

[Verse 1]
I'm done with the drinking
Im done with the smoking
I'm done with the playing
I'm done with the joking
Im done with the ladies
I'm done with the fellas
Just sayin' 
Farewell tequila, so long margarita
And Lady Sativa, I hate to leave ya
Don't want the pressure
I don't need a lecture
No, thank you, honey, God bless ya

[Pre-Chorus]
I know I've said it all before 
But it won't hurt to do it all once more

[Chorus]
This is my last hurrah, once I start
I ain't gonna stop tiI I go too far
Last hurrah and its okay
Maybe tomorrow I won't feel this pain
Last hurrah
Last hurrah

[Verse 2]
Im done with the heartache
I'm done with the demons
Can't wait to be normal
Right after this weekend
I'm done with the drama
Im fixing my karma
One more night of pure nirvana

[Pre-Chorus]
I know I've said it all before
But it won't hurt to do it all once more

[Chorus]
This is my last hurrah, once I start
I ain't gonna stop 'til I go too far
Last hurrah and it's okay
Maybe tomorrow I won't feel this pain
Last hurrah
Last hurrah

[Bridge]
Maybe I'll never change
But I'm still glad I came
Try again another day
But for now

[Chorus]
This is my last hurrah, once I start
I ain't gonna stop 'til I go too far
Last hurrah and it's okay
Maybe tomorrow I won't feel this pain
Last hurrah
Last hurrah

[Verse 1: Bebe Rexha]
You're sayin' that your tired of all your empty habits
You want something that's deeper, 'cause you're over the generics
You're fuckin' with them basics when you really want the baddest
So c'mon, baby, get it, 'cause to miss it, it would be tragic

[Chorus: Bebe Rexha]
You say you want a bad bitch
Baby, now you have it
Now you got a bad bitch

Say you want a bad bitch
Baby, now you have it
Now you got the baddest

[Post-Chorus: Bebe Rexha]
Bad bitch, bad bitch

You know I can handle it

When you throw that thing back at me like a lateral
You be goin' all night when you on that adderall
We be goin' all night when you on that adderall
Bad bitch, bad bitch

Get some double Cs on your bag with the brass, oh

[Bridge: Bebe Rexha]
I pay my own bills and I pay my own rent
'Cause I'm indepen-independent
I buy my own rings and I do my own things
'Cause I'm indepen-independent
I know it really hurts, I know it ain't fair
You're not allowed to touch, but you can stare
Know it really hurts, know it ain't fair
So keep sayin' your prayers

[Chorus: Bebe Rexha]
You say you want a bad bitch
Baby, now you have it
Now you got a bad bitch
Show me you can handle this
Say you want a bad bitch
Baby, now you have it

[Outro: Bebe Rexha]
Bad bitch, bad bitch
Bad bitch, bad bitch
Bad bitch, bad bitch
Bad bitch, bad bitch
Show me you can handle this

[Verse 1]
There's a war inside my head
Sometimes I wish that I was dead
I'm broken
So I call this therapist
And she said, Girl, you cant be fixed, just take this.

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm tired of tryna to be normal
I'm always overthinkin'
I'm drivin' myself crazy
So what if I'm fucking crazy?
And I don't need your quick fix
I don't want your prescriptions
Just 'cause you say I'm crazy
So what if I'm fucking crazy?

[Chorus]
And I'm gonna show you loco, maniac
Sick bitch, psychopath
Yeah, I'm gonna show you, I'm gonna show you
Yeah, I'm gonna show you, mental, out my brain
Batshit, go insane
Yeah, I'm gonna show you, I'm gonna show you
Yeah, I'm gonna show you

[Verse 2]
I've been searching city streets
Trying to find the missing piece, like you said
And I searched hard only to find
There's not a single thing that's wrong with my mind

[Pre-Chorus]
Yeah, I'm tired of tryna to be normal
I'm always overthinkin'
I'm drivin' myself crazy
So what if I'm fucking crazy?
And I don't need your quick fix
I don't want your prescriptions
Just 'cause you say I'm crazy
So what if I'm fucking crazy?

[Chorus]
I'm gonna show you loco, maniac
Sick bitch, psychopath
Yeah, I'm gonna show you, I'm gonna show you
Yeah, I'm gonna show you, mental, out my brain
Batshit, go insane
Yeah, I'm gonna show you, I'm gonna show you

[Bridge]
Crazy, crazy
Yeah, I'm gonna show you
Crazy, crazy

Crazy, crazy

Tired of tryna be normal
I'm drivin' myself crazy
No, I don't need your quick fix
I don't want your prescriptions
Just 'cause you say I'm crazy
So what if I'm fucking crazy?

[Chorus]
Yeah, I'm gonna show you loco, maniac
Sick bitch, psychopath
Yeah, I'm gonna show you, I'm gonna show you
Yeah, I'm gonna show you, mental, out my brain
Batshit, go insane
Yeah, I'm gonna show you, I'm gonna show you
I'm gonna show you

[Verse 1]
Sittin' in a parked car
We don't even fight no more
We don't even touch no more
Used to be my best friend
We don't even laugh no more
Barely even talk no more

[Pre-Chorus]
You wanna hold my hand and then you won't
You say you love me then you don't
You keep me running and running around

[Chorus]
If I'm not all you need
Then just set me free
I'm down on my knees
If you're not the one for me
Then just let me be
I'm begging you, please
I'm praying for closed doors and open windows
I'll follow where the wind blows
Don't be scared to leave
If I'm not all you need
Then just set me free
I'm down on my knees, tonight

[Verse 2]
We used to go out on dates
Now you don't wanna go no place
Feels like we're stuck in one place
I wish I could read your mind
Instead I gotta read your eyes
Oh, how they tell me lies

[Pre-Chorus]
You wanna hold my hand and then you won't
You say you love me then you don't
You keep me running and running around

[Chorus]
If I'm not all you need
Then just set me free
I'm down on my knees
If you're not the one for me
Then just let me be
I'm begging you, please
I'm praying for closed doors and open windows
I'll follow where the wind blows
Don't be scared to leave
If I'm not all you need
Then just set me free
I'm down on my knees, tonight

[Bridge]
Set, set, set me free
Let, let, let me be
I'm down, down on my knees 
Set, set, set me free
Let, let, let me be
I'm down, down on my knees

[Chorus]
If I'm not all you need
Then just set me free
I'm down on my knees
If you're not the one for me
Then just let me be
I'm begging you, please
I'm praying for closed doors and open windows
I'll follow where the wind blows
Don't be scared to leave
If I'm not all you need
Then just set me free
I'm down on my knees, tonight

[Verse 1]
Every day's a blur
Sometimes I can't tell what day it is
Don't know what day it is
Can you tell me what day it is?
Life's passing by
'Cause I'm out chasing empty highs
Every hello just means goodbye
But I'm looking for more this time

[Pre-Chorus]
Can we start to slow it down?
Can we learn to live right now?
I just want to feel it all

[Chorus]
I'm a Ferrari
Pulled off on Mulholland Drive
Over the city, the lights are so pretty from up here
I'm a Ferrari
And after the party's done
I keep on going, missing the moments
Living in the fast lane's getting kinda lonely 

[Post-Chorus]
Whoa, whoa, whoa
Living in the fast lane's getting kinda lonely
Whoa, whoa, whoa
Living in the fast lane's getting kinda lonely

[Verse 2]
Got a heavy heart
'Cause it's still beating on its own
Might be going out in the crowd
But I'm still coming home alone
Not trying to say I'm not grateful for everything
I'm just going too fast to see
All the good things in front of me

[Chorus]
I'm a Ferrari
Pulled off on Mulholland Drive
Over the city, the lights are so pretty from up here
I'm a Ferrari
And after the party's done
I keep on going, missing the moments
Living in the fast lane's getting kinda lonely

[Post-Chorus]
Whoa, whoa, whoa
Living in the fast lane's getting kinda lonely
Whoa, whoa, whoa

[Chorus]
I'm a Ferrari
Pulled off on Mulholland Drive
Over the city, the lights are so pretty from up here
I'm a Ferrari
And after the party's done
I keep on going, missing the moments
Living in the fast lane's getting kinda lonely

[Verse 1]
I feel in the beginning, we were living
We were tripping, we were so high
When you told me that you love me, were you bluffin'?
Was it nothing?
Now you're so dry
You can tell me that you're sorry, but I know that you don't mean it
Baby, don't lie
Don't lie
Baby, don't lie

[Pre-Chorus]
And I can't blame myself for getting lost inside the promise of you
And I can't blame you leaving
'Cause what's meant to be will always be true

[Chorus]
There isn't enough love in the atmosphere to keep you here, ahh
There isn't enough love in the atmosphere
Don't leave me here all alone
I ride for my baby
I died for my baby
I'd die for my baby, no lie
There isn't enough love in the atmosphere
In the atmosphere

[Verse 2]
Remember we were running up and down
And getting messy in the hallways
Told me that forever was the time we'd be together, baby, always
Now you're saying that you're sorry
But I know that you don't mean it 'cause you won't stay
No, you won't stay
You won't stay

[Pre-Chorus]
And I can't blame myself for getting lost inside the promise of you
And I can't blame you leaving
'Cause what's meant to be will always be true

[Chorus]
There isn't enough love in the atmosphere to keep you here, ahh
There isn't enough love in the atmosphere
Don't leave me here all alone
I ride for my baby
I died for my baby
I'd die for my baby, no lie
There isn't enough love in the atmosphere
In the atmosphere

[Bridge]
If there's winners and losers, then I'll be the loser
I'm still here, I choose ya
I don't want another, if we can't have each other
'Cause baby, I love ya
Maybe in a different world, baby, I could be your girl
Maybe then I'll be with you
If there's winners and losers, then I'll be the loser
I'm still here, I choose ya

[Chorus]
There isn't enough love in the atmosphere to keep you here, ahh
There isn't enough love in the atmosphere
Don't leave me here all alone
I ride for my baby
I died for my baby
I'd die for my baby, no lie
There isn't enough love in the atmosphere
In the atmosphere

[Verse 1]
You hit me up at 3 A.M. on a Friday night
Say you ain't feelin' right
You need to see my face right now
You ain't over it
Just wanna talk a bit

[Pre-Chorus]
If you wanna talk, let's talk about the way you left me
Left me with a text, so cold 
Even though I'd die to see you
I don't trust myself to meet you
'Cause we both know that your kiss is a gateway drug
Once you get one, it's never enough
Your kiss is a gateway drug
Once you get one, it's never enough

[Chorus]
'Cause kissin' leads to touchin'
Leads to lovin', leads to fuckin'
Leads to someone always seems to get hurt 
Kissin' leads to touchin'
Leads to lovin', leads to fuckin'
Leads to everything mean nothin'
Your kiss is a gateway drug

[Verse 2]
You said that you loved me
If you really loved me, why'd you leave me like that?
Why'd you go around and talk shit like that behind my back?
Love don't do shit like that, ooh

[Pre-Chorus]
If you wanna talk, let's talk about the way you left me
Left me with a text, so cold 
Even though I'd die to see you
I don't trust myself to meet you
'Cause we both know that your kiss is a gateway drug
Once you get one, it's never enough
Your kiss is a gateway drug
Once you get one, it's never enough

[Chorus]
'Cause kissin' leads to touchin'
Leads to lovin', leads to fuckin'
Leads to someone always seems to get hurt 
Kissin' leads to touchin'
Leads to lovin', leads to fuckin'
Leads to everything mean nothin'
Your kiss is a gateway drug

[Breakdown]
Your kiss is a gateway drug
Your kiss is a gateway drug
You're never enough

[Chorus]
'Cause kissin' leads to touchin'
Leads to lovin', leads to fuckin'
Leads to someone always seems to get hurt 
Kissin' leads to touchin'
Leads to lovin', leads to fuckin'
Leads to everything mean nothin'
Your kiss is a gateway drug

[Outro]
Your kiss is a gateway drug
Your kiss is a gateway drug
Your kiss is a gateway drug
Your kiss is a gateway drug

[Chorus]
Got no self control
And I don't mean cigarettes and alcohol
'Cause when it comes to you, I can't say no
I don't want a taste, I want it all

[Verse 1]
When I get your call, I'm out the door, not a minute more
Like an animal, I lose control, it's illogical
Oh, oh

[Pre-Chorus]
One little kiss can turn into a thousand
One little touch and I'm gone

[Chorus]
Got no self control
And I don't mean cigarettes and alcohol
'Cause when it comes to you, I can't say no
I don't want a taste, I want it all
Got no self control
And I don't mean cigarettes and alcohol
When it comes to you, I can't say no
I don't want a taste, I want it all

[Post-Chorus]
Na na na na na na
Na na na na na na na
Na na na na na na
Na na na na na na na
Na na na na na na
Na na na na na na na
Na na na na na na
Na na na na na na na

[Verse 2]
I'm so predictable, fall every time, ain't it pitiful?
And it's not enough, I try to quit, but I'm giving up
Oh, oh

[Pre-Chorus]
One little kiss can turn into a thousand
One little touch and I'm gone

[Chorus]
Got no self control
And I dont mean cigarettes and alcohol
'Cause when it comes to you, I can't say no
I don't want a taste, I want it all
Got no self control
And I don't mean cigarettes and alcohol
When it comes to you, I can't say no
I don't want a taste, I want it all

[Post-Chorus]
Na na na na na na
Na na na na na na na
Na na na na na na
Na na na na na na na

[Bridge]
And my hunger grows
I'm craving you and my body knows
'Cause it wakes me up hot through my chest
This could be love 

[Pre-Chorus]
One little kiss can turn into a thousand
One little touch and I'm gone

[Chorus]
Got no self control
And I don't mean cigarettes and alcohol
'Cause when it comes to you, I can't say no
I don't want a taste, I want it all
Got no self control
And I dont mean cigarettes and alcohol
When it comes to you, I can't say no
I don't want a taste, I want it all

[Post-Chorus]
Na na na na na na
Na na na na na na na
Na na na na na na
Na na na na na na na

[Verse 1]
Oh my god, here we go
I drank a little too much again
Now I'm stuck in your bed again
Oh my god, I'm too close, oh
But this feeling is so damn good
Guess I'm loving it more than I should

[Pre-Chorus]
I know I should leave
But when you are next to me, deep asleep
Your skin on my skin
Can't help the way I feel, ooh
But you cannot know, there's no place I'd rather be, honestly
When I hold you close to me

[Chorus]
I want you to
To love me, to love me, to love me, but don't fall in love
To hold me, to hold me, to hold me, but not for too long
I want you to love me, to love me, but don't fall in love
'Cause I'm not the one to love

[Verse 2]
Oh my god, here we are
I'm fallin' deeper into this mess
Yeah, I know I shouldn't get undressed
We both know this ain't right
It's a little too dangerous, this little thing between us

[Pre-Chorus]
I know I should leave
But when you are next to me, half asleep
Your skin on my skin
Can't help the way I feel, ooh
But you cannot know, there's no place I'd rather be, honestly
When I hold you close to me

[Chorus]
I want you to
To love me, to love me, to love me, but don't fall in love
To hold me, to hold me, to hold me, but not for too long
I want you to love me, to love me, but don't fall in love
'Cause I'm not the one to love

[Bridge]
I want you to
I want you to
I want you to
I know I should leave
But when you are next to me, half asleep
Your skin on my skin

[Chorus]
I want you to
To love me, to love me, to love me, but don't fall in love
To hold me, to hold me, to hold me, but not for too long
I want you to love me, to love me, but don't fall in love
'Cause I'm not the one to love
I want you to
To love me, to love me, to love me
I want you to
To hold me, to hold me, to hold me
I want you to
I want you to love me, to love me, but don't fall in love
'Cause I'm not the one to love

[Verse 1]
You said, "Let me try you on"
So I let you try me on
That's the moment that we fell in deep
Oh, baby
I said, "Just a little bit"
Then I got a taste of it
Now you got me fallin' at your feet

[Pre-Chorus]
And now we're cryin' and lovin'
And now we're fightin' and touchin'
Feels like I'm makin' love to the enemy

[Chorus]
I can only take you in small doses 
Small doses
Lovin' you, it's explosive
You know this
I can only take you in small doses 
Small doses
Lovin' you, it's explosive
You know this
I can only take you in small doses

[Verse 2]
I didnt mean to fall in love
Took one hit, and I was gone
Gotta get my fix or I can't sleep
Oh, baby
Youre the one they warned about
Now I just can't do without
Baby, it's my appetite you feed

[Pre-Chorus]
And now we're cryin' and lovin'
And now we're fightin' and touchin'
Feels like I'm makin' love to the enemy

[Chorus]
I can only take you in small doses 
Small doses
Lovin' you, it's explosive
You know this
I can only take you in small doses 
Small doses
Lovin' you, it's explosive
You know this
I can only take you in small doses 

I can only take you in small doses 


[Pre-Chorus]
And now we're cryin' and lovin'
And now we're fightin' and touchin'
Feels like I'm makin' love to the enemy

[Chorus]
I can only take you in small doses 
Small doses
Lovin' you, it's explosive
You know this
I can only take you in small doses 
Small doses
Lovin' you, it's explosive
You know this
I can only take you in small doses 

I can only take you in small doses 

I can only take you in small doses

[Intro: Bebe Rexha]
Desire, two souls on fire
Desire, two souls on fire

[Verse 1: Bebe Rexha & Quavo]
You got me out here looking foolish
Look like a dog, I'm drooling
Close your mouth, boy, and just prove it
And you know just the way to do it
You gon' make me bring the bag, girl, believe me 
You gon' make me pop some tags, fashion season 
You gon' make me do those moves, stop your breathing 
If you losing faith, I make you believe it

[Pre-Chorus: Quavo & Bebe Rexha]
Got me feeling some type of way 
Got a chain on my heart, and it's spinning in diamonds

[Chorus: Bebe Rexha & Quavo]
Desire, two souls on fire
Make me feel some type of way
Desire, two souls on fire
Feel some type of way
Desire, two souls on fire
Make me feel some type of way
Desire, two souls on fire

[Verse 2: Bebe Rexha & Quavo]
We can go out to the islands on privates
We can drive the latest cars, no mileage
We can do whatever you like, just be quiet
If you don't break my heart, I'll let you inside it

[Pre-Chorus: Quavo & Bebe Rexha]
Got me feeling some type of way 
Got a chain on my heart and it's spinning in diamonds
And that chain around your heart got me blinded

[Chorus: Bebe Rexha & Quavo]
Desire, two souls on fire
Make me feel some type of way
Desire, two souls on fire
Feel some type of way
Desire, two souls on fire
Make me feel some type of way
Desire, two souls on fire
Do I make you feel some type of way?

[Bridge: Bebe Rexha, Both]

Got a chain around my heart and it's spinning in diamonds

And that chain around your heart got me blinded

[Chorus: Bebe Rexha & Quavo]
Desire, two souls on fire
Make me feel some type of way
Desire, two souls on fire
Feel some type of way
Desire, two souls on fire
Make me feel some type of way
Desire, two souls on fire
Do I make you feel some type of way?

[Intro]
No, I'm not 20 anymore
Dont try to make me feel insecure
'Cause if one thing's for sure
I dont wanna be

[Verse 1]
I feel so good in my skin 
Should I let you go or should I let you in?
Oh, baby, don't need no one to show me what to do, yeah

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Beauty's more than a number
When I was younger I didn't know that
And if you gave me the chance I wouldn't go back 

[Chorus]
No, I'm not 20 anymore 
Don't try to make me feel insecure
'Cause Im aging like wine
I get better with time, yes, I do 
And, oh, Im not 20 anymore 
The lines on my face, they weren't there before
But Im wiser, I'm stronger from all of the life I've been through 
Oh, and if one things for sure
I don't wanna be 20 anymore

[Verse 2]
Why lie 'bout how old I am? 
When I'm a better lover than I was in 2010?
Oh, baby, let me show you all the things my body do, yeah

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Beauty's more than a number
When I was younger, I wish I knew that
And now, I'm not afraid, won't hold myself back 

[Chorus]
No, I'm not 20 anymore 
Don't try to make me feel insecure
'Cause I'm aging like wine
I get better with time, yes, I do 
And, oh, I'm not 20 anymore 
The lines on my face, they weren't there before
But I'm wiser, I'm stronger from all of the life I've been through 
Oh, and if one thing's for sure
I don't want to be 20 anymore

[Outro]
Oh, oh-oh
Oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh

[Verse 1]
Oh, they're tryna shoot down angels
They're tryna pull their wings off
So they can't fly
And, oh, but she's so brave, though
Just like a tornado
She's taking us by storm

[Chorus]
You can't stop the girl from going
You can't stop the world from knowing
The truth will set you free, oh
You can't stop the girl from going
You can't stop the world from knowing
The truth will set you free, oh

[Post-Chorus]
You can't stop the girl

[Verse 2]
They're tryna take our voices
They're tryna make our choices
So we scream loud, loud, loud
And, oh, I know you feel the lightnin'
And it's so excitin'
So, here we come

[Chorus]
You can't stop the girl from going
You can't stop the world from knowing
The truth will set you free, oh
You can't stop the girl from going
You can't stop the world from knowing
The truth will set you free, oh

[Post-Chorus]
You can't stop the girl
You can't stop the girl
You can't stop the girl
No, you can't stop the girl

[Outro]
Oh, I know you feel the lightnin'
And it's so excitin'
So, here we come
That's good enough for right now

[Verse 1]
I've seen better days, better towns
My love is all used up and it brings me down
Can't seem to get it right, this crazy life
Broken promises, now realize

[Pre-Chorus]
Whoo, it's just me, myself and I
Solo ride until I die
'Cause I got me for life
Whoo, I don't need a hand to hold
Even when the night is cold
I got that fire in my soul

[Chorus]
I don't need anything to get me through the night
Except the beat that's in my heart
Yeah, it's keeping me alive
I don't need anything to make me satisfied
'Cause the music does me good and it gets me every time
Like ba-ba-ba-ba-da-ba
Ba-ba-ba-da-ba
Ba-ba-ba-ba-da-ba
Ba-ba-ba-da-ba
Ba-ba-ba-ba-da-ba
Ba-ba-ba-da-ba
'Cause the music does me good and it gets me every time

[Verse 2]
Taste that bitter taste and wash it down
I'm in a better place, a little sweeter now
I'm done with compromise, it's overdue
Take my memories, take my tears
I'm so over you

[Pre-Chorus]
Whoo, it's just me, myself and I
Solo ride until I die
'Cause I got me for life
Whoo, I don't need a hand to hold
Even when the night is cold
I got that fire in my soul

[Chorus]
I don't need anything to get me through the night
Except the beat that's in my heart
Yeah, it's keeping me alive
I don't need anything to make me satisfied
'Cause the music does me good and it gets me every time
Like ba-ba-ba-ba-da-ba
Ba-ba-ba-da-ba
Ba-ba-ba-ba-da-ba
Ba-ba-ba-da-ba
Ba-ba-ba-ba-da-ba
Ba-ba-ba-da-ba
'Cause the music does me good and it gets me every time

[Interlude]




[Bridge]
Whoo, it's just me, myself and I
Whoo, I don't need a hand to hold
Even when the night is cold
I got that fire in my soul

[Chorus]
I don't need anything to get me through the night
Except the beat that's in my heart
Yeah, it's keeping me alive
I don't need anything to make me satisfied

[Chorus]
I just wanna do what I want 
I don't want no one to tell me nothing 
I just wanna live how I want 
I don't wanna hear nothing about it
'Cause I got time, I got time
I'll go and get high if I wanna get high
Love who I want
'Cause I got time, I got time
'Cause I got time, I got time, I got time
And right now I ain't worried 'bout none
Yeah, right now I ain't worried 'bout none
Yeah, right now I ain't worried 'bout none

[Verse 1]
I do what I wanna
I run up the commas
We mix marijuana with a cup of liquor
All my friends are monsters
I don't need no sponsors
Spend this money now 'cause I might not be here tomorrow
I mix-match designers
I'm a fashion statement
I'm elevator high, but I started on the pavement
Yeah, I came from nothing
Turned it into something
Look into the mirror, I tell myself, "I'm fucking awesome."

[Chorus]
I just wanna do what I want 
I don't want no one to tell me nothing 
I just wanna live how I want 
I don't wanna hear nothing about it
'Cause I got time, I got time
I'll go and get high if I wanna get high
Love who I want
'Cause I got time, I got time
'Cause I got time, I got time, I got time
And right now I ain't worried 'bout none
Yeah, right now I ain't worried 'bout none
Yeah, right now I ain't worried 'bout none

[Verse 2]
I don't hear opinions
I don't ever listen
Haters wanna see me fall, tell 'em keep waitin'
I don't have no patience
I'm immune to fake shit
Everybody in my crew, we fucking amazing
Yeah, I ball
Yeah, I'm ballin' like Lebron
Hundred thousand for the charm
I'm so irresponsible
Momma said take it easy, but I don't never take it easy

[Chorus]
I just wanna do what I want 
I don't want no one to tell me nothing 
I just wanna live how I want 
I don't wanna hear nothing about it
'Cause I got time, I got time
I'll go and get high if I wanna get high
Love who I want
'Cause I got time, I got time
'Cause I got time, I got time, I got time
And right now I ain't worried 'bout none
Yeah, right now I ain't worried 'bout none
Yeah, right now I ain't worried 'bout none

What you lookin' at's the real, ain't nothin' on me plastic
YSL up on my heels, I be stoppin' traffic
You be lookin' at my ass
Damn, that thing Jurassic
That's it, that's it, that's it, that's it
I be ridin' through West, dodgin' paparazzi 
Diamonds drippin' on my neck, I be saucy saucy 
Damn, I'm dressed fresh to death, steppin' out the coffin  
That's it, that's it, that's it, that's it

[Verse 2: Gucci Mane]

I'm on the top
Don't even get me started, 'cause I don't like to stop 
I'm shinin' harder than everybody and I just wore a watch
Two bad bitches, one say that she just wanna watch 
I hope she know she lookin' at a whole lotta Gwop
This bitch so bad that she deserve a whole lotta props
If he ain't gettin' money, she ain't even gon' talk 
She spoiled like a toddler, ain't her fault
She love to call me daddy, I treat her like Pops


[Chorus: Bebe Rexha]
That's it, that's it, that's it, that's it

[Verse 3: Bebe Rexha]
Multicolorful Chopard with the swimming fishes
Motherfucker I'm a star, I don't do no dishes
I don't ever speak or talk of you basic bitches
That's it, that's it, that's it, that's it
Pullin' up in that thing that's a little vicious
Barbies from New York, I hail outta Brooklyn
That's why all eyes are on, yeah, I see you lookin'
That's it, that's it, that's it, that's it

[Verse 4: 2 Chainz]

Yeah, I like my coffee cold, like my women hot 
I like my spot big, like my car drop 
Revenge of the have and the have nots 
'Cause back then I didn't even have knots
Yeah, shawty look kinda cute, but her friend there look kinda cuter
I was on the MacBook computer, tryna go through the whole Kama Sutra
I did, I did, that's it, that's it
Mattress, passion, satisfaction
Ow

[Chorus: Bebe Rexha & 2 Chainz]
That's it, that's it, that's it, that's it 
That's it, that's it, that's it, that's it

That's it, that's it, that's it, that's it 
That's it, that's it, that's it, that's it
That's it, that's it 

[Verse 1]
I knew from the moment that I met you, this wasn't right
But I couldn't leave you 'cause you treated me so damn right
There was nothing wrong with you
The truth is you're a damn good guy
But I knew from the moment that I met you, this wasn't right

[Pre-Chorus]
And you had money and cars, looked like a star
You loved me so good, I could cry
Bought me roses and rings, such beautiful things
But I was taught never to lie

[Chorus]
I hate to see the look on your face
I wish I could make myself stay
But our hearts don't live in the same space
So tell me how to break yours with grace


[Verse 2]
I knew from the moment that I left you, you'd be alright
You're gonna find another lover, one who doesn't waste your time
But every time you look at me, my body says, "One last night"
I swear I wouldn't leave with you, but I just came to say goodbye

[Pre-Chorus]
And you had money and cars, looked like a star
You loved me so good, I could cry
Bought me roses and rings, such beautiful things
But I was taught never to lie

[Chorus]
I hate to see the look on your face
I wish I could make myself stay
But our hearts don't live in the same space
So tell me how to break yours with grace

[Violin Solo]

[Chorus]
I hate to see the look on your face
I wish I could make myself stay
But our hearts don't live in the same space
So tell me how to break yours with grace
[Intro]
Steady

[Verse 1: Bebe Rexha]
Something 'bout a rapper, something 'bout a singer
Trying to make a feeling last longer than a linger
They knew exactly what they were getting into
He was always sippin', she was something different
Together they were living, never ever overthinking
Falling in madly, running from their issues
And he's not to blame, and she's not to blame
Drinking the love that they pour in the cup 'cause it eases the pain
And he'll never change, she'll never change
Breathing the hope that they find in the smoke 'cause it eases the pain

[Pre-Chorus: Bebe Rexha]
We only love when our eyes get heavy
We only laugh, we only dance when the high gets steady
Yeah, we only touch when our hands get messy
We only laugh, only attach when the high gets steady

[Chorus: Bebe Rexha]
When the high gets steady
Hi-high gets steady
When the high gets steady
When the high gets steady
Hi-high gets steady
When the high gets steady

[Verse 2: Tory Lanez]
Tory
I pulled up on you last night
I didn't know what to do last night
Pulling out you, put me to my knees, baby
I was on the D R U G's baby
Keep it G, baby
I've been way up, hundred way up
You know what it is, whenever I come through the cake up
And you say you get this feeling with me, baby, on the real
I get the same feeling witcha, I know how you feel
So keep it G with me
'Cause this one I'mma do with ya
I'ma keep it 78 plus 22 with ya
You know what it is when I pull up in that new, new thang
Looking for a new thang, oh

[Pre-Chorus: Bebe Rexha]
We only love when our eyes get heavy
We only laugh, we only dance when the high gets steady
Yeah, we only touch when our hands get messy
We only laugh, only attach when the high gets steady

[Chorus: Bebe Rexha]
When the high gets steady
Hi-high gets steady
When the high gets steady
When the high gets steady
Hi-high gets steady
When the high gets steady

[Outro: Bebe Rexha]
We only love when our eyes get heavy
We only laugh, we only dance when the high gets steady
Yeah, we only touch when our heads get messy
We only laugh, only attach when the high gets steady
When the high gets steady
Hi-high gets steady
Wish we could love
Sober the buzz, but I'm just not steady

[Verse 1]
No one's gonna love you like I do
No one's gonna care like I do
And I can feel it in the way that you breathe
I know you dream of her while you sleep next to me

[Chorus]
I can't stop drinking about you
I gotta numb all the pain
I can't stop drinking about you
Without you, I ain't the same
So, pour a shot in my glass and I'll forget forever, woah
So, pour a shot in my glass, 'cause it makes everything better, woah
Woah

Woah

[Verse 2]
Darlin', tell me what more can I do?
Don't you know that I was meant for you?
You say I feel like heaven on earth
But you'd never know what heaven was if it wasn't for her

[Chorus]
I can't stop drinking about you
I gotta numb all the pain
I can't stop drinking about you
Without you, I ain't the same
So, pour a shot in my glass and I'll forget forever, woah
So, pour a shot in my glass, 'cause it makes everything better, woah
Woah

Woah
I can't stop drinking about you 
And I can't stop drinking about you 

[Bridge]
No one's gonna love you like I do 

[Chorus]
I can't stop drinking about you 
And I can't stop drinking about you 
So, pour a shot in my glass and I'll forget forever 
So, pour a shot in my glass, 'cause it makes everything better, woah
No one's gonna love you like I do

[Intro: Bebe Rexha & Producer]
Do it again, ready, yeah, one more time?
Yeah
And keep going, and keep going like you did this thing
Yaaas
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, whatever, it'll be double long
That's hot, let me hear it back

[Verse 1]
She was a bad girl, he was a good boy
She played with fire while he played inside the ring
She gets so selfish and he was selfless
He played by books, she never liked to play it safe

[Pre-Chorus]
But he fell in love with her fucked up ways
With her drunken days, yeah, he still stayed
Yeah, he fell in love with her twisted dreams
And all in between, and he'd still sing

[Chorus]
Baby, you're a shining star
I like you just like you are
Baby, you're a shining star
I like you just like you are

[Verse 2]
Head underwater, no one could save her
She played with death, she held her breath, she liked the pain
Her world was crumbling, but she did nothing
She numbed herself so she would never feel a thing

[Pre-Chorus]
But he fell in love with her fucked up ways
With her drunken daze, yeah, he still stayed
Yeah, he fell in love with her twisted dreams
And all in between, and he'd still sing

[Chorus]
Baby, you're a shining star
I like you just like you are
Baby, you're a shining star
I like you just like you are

[Bridge]
You know you'll always be my baby, don't cry
You know your crazy doesn't phase me, no lie
'Cause baby, you're a shining star
I like you just like you are

[Outro Instrumental]

Young, wild and free, oh, uh, ohh 
I don't wanna hear it, no

Don't lecture me
Just let me be, oh, uh, ohh

If love is a lie, it's the most beautiful lie that you've ever been told
'Cause nothin'
Nothin' makes me feel like you do
Even though I see through you
If love is a lie, then please don't ever tell me the truth

Oh, when you do it, when you do it like this

Cause nothin'
Nothin' makes me feel like you do 
Even though I see through you 

[Verse 1]
What if I let you in and you don't like what you see?
'Cause it's not what it seems, let me tell you why
You have no idea, yeah, you only seen a piece
But now it's underneath, no, I cannot lie

[Pre-Chorus]
Sometimes I get so frustrated
I've tried a million times to say it
It's so much easier to fake it
So trust me

[Chorus]
Don't get any closer
These walls are super high
So don't even try
To get any closer
I'm scared you're gonna find
All the things I've been hiding from you
All the things I've been hiding from you, oh

[Verse 2]
What if you hear the thoughts that haunt me in my sleep?
The secrets I don't speak running through my mind
You have no idea, yeah, you only seen a piece
But now it's underneath, no, I cannot lie

[Pre-Chorus]
Sometimes I get so frustrated
I've tried a million times to say it
It's so much easier to fake it

I don't need to hear it, but it'd be nice to know
And I don't remember the last time I got off on ya
'Cause you get off on me, but I get off alone

[Pre-Chorus 1: Bebe Rexha]
You better give it to me when I want it
I shouldn't have to ask for it
Give it to me when I want it
Yeah, yeah

So baby, tell me why you never buy me flowers no more?
You're getting comfortable
You're getting too comfortable
Why you never wanna open my door?
You're getting comfortable
You're getting too comfortable, yeah

[Post-Chorus: Bebe Rexha]
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
You're getting too comfortable, comfortable
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
You're getting too comfortable, comfortable

[Outro: Kranium]
Yeah, I bought you roses 
Do all the things I'm supposed to do 
Yeah, nothing that I do is good enough for you 
Baby, what you putting me through?

[Verse 1]
I just wanna kiss your face
I just wanna feel your gaze
I just wanna, I just wanna
I just wanna be where you are
I just wanna feel your touch
I'm not asking for too much
I just wanna, I just wanna
I just wanna wake up where you are

[Pre-Chorus]
I used to think that love was just so easy
But I couldn't be less right, yeah
I finally found someone perfect
Just for me gotta fly thousands of miles, yeah

[Chorus]
I'll be alright, just one more night
I'll be just fine, holdin' my pillow pretending it's you, though
I'll be alright, just one more night
I'll be just fine, holdin' my pillow pretending it's you, though

[Verse 2]
I need a minute to breathe you in
Just a second to taste your skin
I just gotta, I just gotta
Feel you here right next to me
Can we please just go back in time?
Those lazy Sundays, you and I
'Cause every hour and every day
Gets more painful when you're away

[Pre-Chorus]
I used to think that love was just so easy
But I couldnt be less right, yeah

[Chorus]
I'll be alright, just one more night
I'll be just fine, holdin' my pillow pretending it's you, though
I'll be alright, just one more night
I'll be just fine, holdin' my pillow pretending it's you, though

[Bridge]
And I can't lie, baby, I'm losing my patience
Too much waiting for you
Every time that I wake up
My hands go where I'm waiting for you
I know I say that I'm fine, but I'm losing my mind
Just need to hold you
Don't take your time
Oh, baby

[Chorus]
I'll be alright, just one more night
I'll be just fine, holdin' my pillow pretending it's you, though
I'll be alright, just one more night
I'll be just fine, holdin' my pillow pretending it's you, though

[Verse 1]
Do you ever sit in silence all alone?
Drowned out by your thoughts?
Trying to get a grip, but just keep on spiralling down
Voices getting loud, feeling something now
Only you know way too well
Do you ever sleep with troubles in your head?
Wrapped up in regrets
Reaching for the help you gotta find inside yourself
You're stuck inside a spell
Don't need nobody else, -body else

[Pre-Chorus]
So don't you mind
I'm doing just fine, I'll be fine, I'll be fine

[Chorus]
Maybe I'm just comfortable
Maybe I'm just comfortable
Baby, maybe I-I-I'm just comfortable being sad 
Yeah, maybe I'm just comfortable
Maybe I'm just comfortable
Baby, maybe I-I-I'm just comfortable being sad 

[Verse 2]
When I need to get away, run this out my brain
I feel some type of way
I'm dancing all alone, surrounded by everyone else
I do it to myself
Not asking for your help, for your help

[Pre-Chorus]
So don't you mind
I'm doing just fine, I'll be fine, I'll be fine

[Chorus]
Maybe I'm just comfortable
Maybe I'm just comfortable
Baby, maybe I-I-I'm just comfortable being sad 
Yeah, maybe I'm just comfortable
Maybe I'm just comfortable
Baby, maybe I-I-I'm just comfortable being sad 

[Pre-Chorus]
So don't you mind
I'm doing just fine, I'll be fine, I'll be fine

[Chorus]
Maybe I'm just comfortable
Maybe I'm just comfortable
Baby, maybe I-I-I'm just comfortable being sad 
Yeah, maybe I'm just comfortable
Maybe I'm just comfortable
Baby, maybe I-I-I'm just comfortable being sad 

[Verse 1]
In the darkest of my nights
A little spark begun to shine
Woke up and I realized
Imperfection is divine

[Pre-Chorus]
So this creepy heart of mine
That's tiptoeing on the line
I know it will be just fine
And I know I

[Chorus]
I'm friends with the monster that's under my bed
Get along with the voices inside of my head
You're trying to save me, stop holdin' your breath
And you think I'm crazy, yeah, you think I'm crazy
Well that's nothing 
Well that's nothing 

[Verse 2]
In a world so black and white
Out of place and out of my mind
Woke up and I realized
Imperfection is divine

[Pre-Chorus]
So this creepy heart of mine
That's tiptoeing on the line
I know it will be just fine
And I know I

[Chorus]
I'm friends with the monster that's under my bed
Get along with the voices inside of my head
You're trying to save me, stop holdin' your breath
And you think I'm crazy, yeah, you think I'm crazy
Well that's nothing 
Well that's nothing 
I'm friends with the monster that's under my bed
Get along with the voices inside of my head
You're trying to save me, stop holdin' your breath
And you think I'm crazy, yeah, you think I'm crazy
Well that's nothing 
Well that's nothing 
I'm friends with the monster that's under my bed
Get along with the voices inside of my head
You're trying to save me, stop holdin' your breath
And you think I'm crazy, yeah, you think I'm crazy
Well that's nothing 
Well that's nothing 

[Intro]



[Verse 1]
It's like bed bugs in a five-star hotel
First date, pretty face, but he's dumb as hell
He's dumb as hell
It's like choking on a LifeSaver
Like a firehouse burnin' to the ground 
Burnin' to the ground

[Pre-Chorus]
And I keep runnin', runnin' circles, circles
Tryna understand why the dreams I die for are now killin' me
And I keep runnin', runnin' circles, circles
Tryna figure out why this life is not what I thought it'd be, yeah

[Chorus]
I wanna go back to the sweet beginnings
When I was young and full of innocence
I wanna go back to complete surrender of you
The sweet beginnings, oh



[Verse 2]
It's like you're allergic to your medication
Meant to make you better, but it makes you worse
It makes you worse
It's like dyin' in your own living room
Like a U-Haul following behind a hearse
We all turn to dirt

[Pre-Chorus]
And I keep runnin', runnin' circles, circles
Tryna understand why this life is not what I thought it'd be
Yeah, yeah

[Chorus]
I wanna go back to the sweet beginnings
When I was young and full of innocence
I wanna go back to complete surrender of you
The sweet beginnings of

The sweet beginning of 
The sweet beginnings of

So let go of your heart

So let go of your heart

[Bridge]
I wanna go back to the sweet beginnings
When I was young and full of innocence
I wanna go back to complete surrender of you
The sweet beginnings, oh

[Chorus]
I wanna go back to the sweet beginnings
When I was young and full of innocence
I wanna go back to complete surrender of you
The sweet beginnings, oh
The sweet beginnings, oh
The sweet beginnings, oh
The sweet beginnings, oh

[Verse 1]
I was lost, but you found me
Hiding in the shadows from my destiny
And you sawthingsthat no oneelse could see
You saved me whenI was my worst enemy

[Chorus]
It feels so good to be alive
Just you and me tonight
Don't wake me up from this high
What a beautiful life
I heard your heart call mine
And then all the stars aligned
Don't wake me up from this high
What a beautiful life

[Verse 2]
Spread through me like a wild flame
I feel it in my veins
I'll never ever be the same
I'll never be the same
Cheers to the thing money can't buy
Can't buy what I feel inside
This thing, I can't deny
Our pretty little paradise

[Chorus]
It feels so good to be alive
Just you and me tonight
Don't wake me up from this high
What a beautiful life
I heard your heart call mine
And then all the stars aligned
Don't wake me up from this high
What a beautiful life

[Post-Chorus]
Woah-oo-oh
Woah-oo-oh

What a beautiful life
I heard your heart call mine
And then all the stars aligned
Don't wake me up from this high
What a beautiful life

[Verse 1]
Turned a boy into a man in just one night
Now you wanna be my lover
Like you've never seen in color
Yeah, I get off when I see that you're in pain
Want that high top of the mountain
Dip it in the holy fountain

[Pre-Chorus]
You don't want love unless it's mine
Now you want it all the time
Yeah, you want me all out your mind

[Chorus]
You don't want love unless it's mine
It don't feel right unless it's mine
Twenty-four hours on your mind
Now you want it all the time
You don't want love unless it's mine
It don't feel right unless it's mine
Twenty-four hours on your mind
Now you want it all the time
You don't want love unless it's

[Verse 2]
Look at you, looking up, down on your knees
Treading in the sacred waters
Waiting 'til the high gets stronger, yeah, yeah
I'll keep you begging, begging, ooh
I'm your fetish, ooh
Come and get it, ooh

[Pre-Chorus]
You don't want love unless it's mine
Now you want it all the time

[Chorus]
You don't want love unless it's mine
It don't feel right unless it's mine
Twenty-four hours on your mind
Now you want it all the time
You don't want love unless it's mine
It don't feel right unless it's mine
Twenty-four hours on your mind
Now you want it all the time
You don't want love unless it's mine

[Verse 1]
When your heart is borrowed
Where the grass is green, but underneath you're cold and hollow
Yeah, the words are sweet but no see they're hard to swallow
So sick of your crooked smile and your counterfeit soul
Your counterfeit soul

[Pre-Chorus]
And you got teeth like a wolf
But you cry like a sheep, yeah

[Chorus]
Don't be mad, mad, you did it
Caught you red hands in it
You're so bad, yeah, I get it
You made your bed, now rest in it
Run and cry wolf!
Wolf!

[Verse 2]
When your heart has turned to stone
When the things you weren't meant to see are all that you know
Too late to sell back the lies and the dreams that you were sold
So sick of your crooked smile and your counterfeit soul
Your counterfeit soul

[Pre-Chorus]
And you got teeth like a wolf
But you cry like a sheep, yeah

[Chorus]
Don't be mad, mad, you did it
Caught you red hands in it
You're so bad, yeah, I get it
You made your bed, now rest in it
Run and cry wolf!
Wolf!

[Bridge]
Heyyyyyyyyyyyy, oooooooooooh [x4]
And you got teeth like a wolf
But you cry
You cry

[Chorus]
Don't be mad, mad, you did it
Caught you red hands in it
You're so bad, yeah, I get it
You made your bed, now rest in it
Run and cry wolf!
Wolf!

[Outro]
Cry wolf!
Wolf!
Mad, mad, you did it
Caught you red hands in it
You're so bad, yeah, I get it
Made your bed, now rest in it

[Verse 1]
I needed you like the stars need the night
But you left me in the dark, here to die
And we had something that money could never buy
But you ruined it with all your twisted lies

[Pre-Chorus]
Push through the storm, baby push through the pain
Dust myself off and stay in the game
Won't let you tell me, tell me I'm out
I am the queen and this is my crown
I am a fighter, I'm the igniter
I'm gonna light your whole world on fire
I wanna thank you for making me so much stronger

[Chorus]
Bad bitches don't cry
We just get even, even
So raise your fist, raise them to the sky
Baby keep believin'-lievin'
And if there's one thing that I've ever learned
It's that if you play with fire, you're bound to get burned
But bad bitches don't cry, don't cry, don't cry, don't cry, don't cry

[Verse 2]
I bet you thought I'd be nothing without you
But you thought wrong cause baby I am bulletproof

[Pre-Chorus]
Push through the storm, baby push through the pain
Dust myself off and stay in the game
Won't let you tell me, tell me I'm out
I am the queen and this is my crown
I am a fighter, I'm the igniter
I'm gonna light your whole world on fire
I wanna thank you for making me so much stronger

[Chorus]
Bad bitches don't cry
We just get even, even
So raise your fist, raise them to the sky
Baby keep believin'-lievin'
And if there's one thing that I've ever learned
It's that if you play with fire, you're bound to get burned
But bad bitches don't cry, don't cry, don't cry, don't cry, don't cry

[Verse 1]
Numb me down to the core
Cause love don't live here anymore
And we fought hard but we lost the war
Without you, what am I living for?

[Pre-Chorus]
And I know I can't take back all the things I did
But if I had one wish, I would wish for one more chance
Somewhere our fear took all control
That's when I turned cold
Won't you give me one more chance?

[Chorus]
Cause I'm a lost river that'll never reach the sea
When you're not here with me, when you're gone
I'm sick to my bones, I don't feel natural
Without you I'm not whole, when you're gone

[Post-Chorus]
Gone, gone, gone, gone
Gone, gone, gone
Gone, gone, gone, gone, gone

[Verse 2]
Drove to your house in the night
Couldn't sleep 'til I made it right
I'm sorry for all the pain
For lovin' you in vain

[Pre-Chorus]
And I know I can't take back all the things I did
But if I had one wish, I would wish for one more chance
Somewhere fear took all control
And that's when I turned cold
Won't you give me one more chance?

[Chorus]
Cause I'm a lost river that'll never reach the sea
When you're not here with me, when you're gone
I'm sick to my bones, I don't feel natural
Without you I'm not whole, when you're gone

[Bridge]
So I'm leaving my light on
In hopes that you will find your way
And make it safely home
And in the eye of the storm
Our love will be the only thing
That keeps us holding on

[Chorus]
I'm a lost river that'll never reach the sea
When you're not here with me, when you're gone
I'm sick to my bones, I don't feel natural
Without you I'm not whole, when you're gone

[Post-Chorus]
Gone, gone, gone, gone
Gone, gone, gone
Gone, gone, gone, gone, gone

[Verse 1]
Phones in our faces
I'm waiting for that high next notification
Where's the conversation?
I'm getting real restless, staring at faces

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Filter this, filter that
It don't even matter
What you got, who you are
Is all that I'm after
I'm afraid that lately we're losing our selves

[Chorus]
Cause I just wanna be human
Baby I just wanna feel
I just wanna be human
Can you give me something real?

[Post-Chrous]
Oh, I wanna live, I wanna love, I wanna touch
Let's just be human
I wanna fight, I wanna cry, it's not enough
Let's just be human

[Verse 2]
So what am I chasing?
Posting up pictures for the validation
The more I get attention
The more I feel lonely, there's something missing

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Follow me, follow her
It don't even matter
What you got, who you are
Is all that I'm after
I'm afraid that lately we're losing our selves

[Chorus]
Cause I just wanna be human
Baby I just wanna feel
I just wanna be human
Can you give me something real?

[Post-Chrous]
Oh, I wanna live, I wanna love, I wanna touch
Let's just be human
I wanna fight, I wanna cry, it's not enough
Let's just be human
I wanna be human, oh

[Bridge]
I wanna live, I wanna love, I wanna touch
I wanna fight, I wanna cry, it's not enough

[Chorus]
I just wanna be human
Baby I just wanna feel
I just wanna be human
Can you give me something real?

[Post Chrous]
I wanna live, I wanna love, I wanna touch
I wanna fight, I wanna cry, it's not enough
Let's just be human
I wanna be human

[Outro]
Phones in our faces
Still waiting for that high next notification

[Verse 1]
I'm tired of my thoughts
They weigh me down, feels like I'm drowning
I'm tired of my flaws
They feel me with anxiety and doubt

[Pre-Chorus]
Honestly, I'm done with hating pictures of myself
And trying to be like everybody else

[Chorus]
I wanna be like, look like the girl in the mirror
Wanna act like, dance like no one's watching her
I could try to be just like you
But I wanna be like me, the girl in the mirror

[Post-Chorus]
The girl in the mirror
The girl in the mirror

[Verse 2]
I'm sick of the likes and followers everyone's counting
I'm sick of the lies, smiling, but I'm crying inside

[Pre-Chorus]
Honestly, I'm done with hating pictures of myself
And trying to be like everybody else

[Chorus]
I wanna be like, look like the girl in the mirror
Wanna act like, dance like no one's watching her
I could try to be just like you
But I wanna be like me, the girl in the mirror

[Post-Chorus]
The girl in the mirror
The girl in the mirror

[Bridge]
Wanna wake up, no make-up
And still think I'm beautiful
Wanna smile like I mean it
And finally be comfortable with me
Finally be comfortable with me, oh

[Chorus]
I wanna be like, look like the girl in the mirror
Wanna act like, dance like no one's watching her
I could try to be just like you
But I wanna be like me, the girl in the mirror

[Post-Chorus]
The girl in the mirror
The girl in the mirror
Girl in the mirror
The girl in the mirror

Why men great 'til they gotta be great?
Woo!

[Verse 1]
I just took a DNA test, turns out I'm 100% that bitch
Even when I'm crying crazy
Yeah, I got boy problems, that's the human in me
Bling bling, then I solve 'em, that's the goddess in me
You coulda had a bad bitch, non-committal
Help you with your career just a little
You're 'posed to hold me down, but you're holding me back
And that's the sound of me not calling you back

[Chorus]
Why men great 'til they gotta be great? 
Don't text me, tell it straight to my face 
Best friend sat me down in the salon chair 
Shampoo press, get you out of my hair
Fresh photos with the bomb lighting 
New man on the Minnesota Vikings 
Truth hurts, needed something more exciting 
Bom bom bi dom bi dum bum bay 

[Verse 2]
You tried to break my heart?
Oh, that breaks my heart
That you thought you ever had it
No, you ain't from the start
Hey, I'm glad you're back with your bitch
I mean, who would wanna hide this?
I will never, ever, ever, ever, ever be your side chick
I put the sing in single
Ain't worried 'bout a ring on my finger
So you can tell your friend, "Shoot your shot" when you see him
It's okay, he already in my DMs

[Chorus]
Why men great 'til they gotta be great? 
Don't text me, tell it straight to my face 
Best friend sat me down in the salon chair 
Shampoo press, get you out of my hair

We don't fuck with lies , we don't do goodbyes 
We just keep it pushing like ay-ay-ay

We don't fuck with lies , we don't do goodbyes 
We just keep it pushing like ay-ay-ay 

[Chorus]
Why men great 'til they gotta be great? 
Don't text me, tell it straight to my face

Truth hurts, needed something more exciting 
Bom bom bi dom bi dum bum bay

Woo, child, tired of the bullshit
Go on, dust your shoulders off, keep it moving
Yes, Lord, tryna get some new shit
In there, swimwear, going-to-the-pool shit
Come now, come dry your eyes
You know you a star, you can touch the sky
I know that it's hard, but you have to try
If you need advice, let me simplify

[Pre-Chorus]
If he don't love you anymore
Just walk your fine ass out the door

I do my hair toss, check my nails
Baby, how you feelin'? 
Hair toss, check my nails
Baby, how you feelin'?

[Verse 2]
Woo, girl, need to kick off your shoes
Gotta take a deep breath, time to focus on you
All the big fights, long nights that you been through
I got a bottle of tequila I been saving for you
Boss up and change your life
You can have it all, no sacrifice
I know he did you wrong, we can make it right
So go and let it all hang out tonight

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause he don't love you anymore
So walk your fine ass out the door

[Chorus]
And do your hair toss, check my nails
Baby, how you feelin'?

The juice ain't worth the squeeze
If the juice don't look like this 
Hold up, nigga, please
Don't make me have to take your bitch, shit 

[Pre-Chorus]
If I'm shinin', everybody gonna shine

Ayy, boy, whatcha say, boy?
You tryna play coy like a Gameboy?
Hit my phone boy, is you home boy?
Are you alone boy? Come give me dome, boy
Got a boy with degrees, a boy in the streets
A boy on his knees, he a man in the sheets
Sheesh, it's all Greek to me
Got this boy speaking Spanish, ay Papi

[Pre-Chorus]
Baby, I don't need you

[Chorus]
Boys, boys, boys
Make a girl go crazy 
Boys, boys, boys
Make a girl go crazy 

[Verse 2]
I like big boys, itty bitty boys
Mississippi boys, inner city boys
I like the pretty boys with the bow tie
Get your nails did, let it blow dry
I like a big beard, I like a clean face
I don't discriminate, come and get a taste
From the playboys to the gay boys
Go and slay, boys, you my fave boys

[Pre-Chorus]
Baby, I don't need you 
I just wanna freak you

Once upon a time, I was a ho

Got you something from the liquor store
Little bit of Lizzo and some Mo
Tryna open up a little mo'
Sorry if my heart a little slow

But baby, baby

[Intro]
Uh 

[Verse 1]
Woke up feelin' like I just might run for President
Even if there ain't no precedent, switchin' up the messaging
I'm about to add a little estrogen
Buy my whip by myself, pay my rent by myself
Only exes that I care about are in my fucking chromosomes
I don't really need you, I'm Macaulay Culkin, home alone
Bad bitch, diamonds in my collarbone 
Buy my whip by myself, pay my rent by myself

[Pre-Chorus]
Sugar, spice, and I'm nice
Show me what you're made of
Crazy, sexy, cool, baby
With or without makeup
Got nothing to prove 
But I'ma show you how I do

[Chorus]
Find me up in Magic City bustin' hundreds by the bands
And I throw it 
Go and throw it 
Hangin' out the 750, feelin' bossy in my city
'Cause I run it 
Run it, run it 
I work my femininity
I make these boys get on their knees
Now watch me do it, watch me do it
Look it, look it, I'ma do it
Like a girl 
Like a girl 

[Verse 2]
Chaka Kahn, "Through the Fire," light the kerosene 
Lauryn Hill told me everything is everything 
Serena Willy showed me I can win the Wimbledon 
Uh, put me on a pedestal, bet on me, bet I will

[Pre-Chorus]
Sugar, spice, and I'm nice
Show me what you're made of
Crazy, sexy, cool, baby
With or without makeup
Got nothing to prove 
But I'ma show you how I do 

[Chorus]
Find me up in Magic City bustin' hundreds by the bands
And I throw it 
Go and throw it 
Hangin' out the 750, feelin' bossy in my city

Now watch me do it, watch me do it
Look it, look it, I'mma do it

[Bridge]
Look, so if you fight like a girl, cry like a girl
Do your thing, run the whole damn world
If you feel like a girl, then you real like a girl
Do your thing, run the whole damn world
If you fight like a girl, cry like a girl
Do your thing, run the whole damn world
If you feel like a girl, then you real like a girl
Do your thing, run the whole damn world

[Chorus]
Find me up in Magic City bustin' hundreds by the bands
And I throw it 

Go and throw it 
Hangin' out the 750 
Feelin' bossy in my city

Run it, run it 
I work my femininity 
I make these boys get on their knees 
Now watch me do it, watch me do it
Look it, look it, I'ma do it 
Like a girl

[Outro]
Shit, fuck, I didn't know it was ending right there

[Intro]
True story
No glory, let's go

[Verse 1]
Yeah, the old me used to love a Gemini
Like a threesome, fuckin' with him every night
A lotta two-faced people show me both sides
So I figured out I gotta be my own type

[Pre-Chorus 1]
They used to say to get a man, you had to know how to look
They used to say to keep a man, you had to know how to cook
But I'm solo in Soho, sippin' Soju in Malibu
It's a me, myself kinda attitude

[Chorus]
'Cause I'm my own soulmate 
I know how to love me 
I know that I'm always gonna hold me down
Yeah, I'm my own soulmate 
No, I'm never lonely 
I know I'm a queen, but I don't need no crown
Look up in the mirror like "Damn, she the one"

[Post-Chorus]
One, one, one, one, one, one 
Like "Damn, she the one"
One, one, one 
Bad bitch in the mirror like "Yeah, I'm in love"
Love, love, love, love, love, love 
Like "Yeah, I'm in love"
Love, love, love 
Look up in the mirror like "Damn, she the one"

[Verse 2]
And she never tell me to exercise
We always get extra fries
And you know the sex is fire
And I gotta testify
I get flowers every Sunday
I'ma marry me one day

[Pre-Chorus 2]
True love ain't something you can buy yourself
True love finally happens when you by yourself
So if you by yourself, then go and buy yourself
Another round from the bottle on the higher shelf

[Chorus]
'Cause I'm my own soulmate 
I know how to love me 
I know that I'm always gonna hold me down

Yeah, I'm my own soulmate 
No, I'm never lonely 

I know I'm a queen, but I don't need no crown
Look up in the mirror like "Damn, she the one"

[Post-Chorus]
One, one, one, one, one, one 

Like, "Damn, she the one"

One, one, one 
Bad bitch in the mirror like, "Yeah, I'm in love"

Love, love, love, love, love, love 

Like "Yeah, I'm in love"

Love, love, love 
Look up in the mirror like "Damn, she the one"

[Bridge]
I'm the one 
I'm the one 
I'm the one 
Look up in the mirror like "Damn, she the one"
One, one, one, one, one, one
Like "Damn, she the one"
One, one, one, one
Bad bitch in the mirror like "Yeah, I'm in love"
Love, love, love, love, love, love 

Love, love, love 
Look up in the mirror 

[Chorus]
'Cause I'm my own soulmate 
I know how to love me 
I know that I'm always gonna hold me down
Look up in the mirror like "Damn, she the one"
Yeah, I'm my own soulmate 
No, I'm never lonely 
I know I'm a queen, but I don't need no crown
Look up in the mirror like "Damn, she the one"

[Chorus: Lizzo]
I do my hair toss, check my nails
Baby, how you feelin'? 
Hairtoss,check my nails

[Verse 1: Lizzo]
Woo, child, tired of the bullshit
Go on, dust your shoulders off, keep it moving
Yes, Lord, tryna get some new shit
In there, swimwear, going-to-the-pool shit
Come now, come dry your eyes
You know you a star, you can touch the sky
I know that it's hard but you have to try
If you need advice, let me simplify

[Pre-Chorus: Lizzo]
If he don't love you anymore
Just walk your fine ass out the door

[Chorus: Lizzo]

[Verse 2: Lizzo & Ariana Grande]
Woo, girl, need to kick off your shoes
Gotta take a deep breath, time to focus on you
All the big fights, long nights that you been through
I got a bottle of tequila I been saving for you 
'Cause he better know my worth
There's so much that I deserve
But I ain't worried now, I'ma let my hair down
He been tryin' it, but not today

[Pre-Chorus: Ariana Grande, Lizzo & Both]
So girl, if he don't love you anymore
Then walk your fine ass out the door

[Chorus]
Jerome, Jerome
Take your ass home
And come back when you're grown
Jerome, Jerome
Go on, take your ass home
Where the peaches have thorns, ooh

[Verse 1]
Poor little baby
Who told you that you stood a chance with this royalty?
You're so sweet, bless your heart
Can't let a pretty face distract me from business
And God as my witness, your ugly ass won't either
I'm sorry, 2 AM photos with smileys and hearts
Ain't the way to my juicy parts
Boy, thank me later, looks good on paper
But love isn't easy, so I'll do the hardest part

[Chorus]
Jerome, Jerome
Go on, take your ass home
And come back when you're grown
Jerome, ooh, Jerome
Go on, take your ass home
Where the peaches have thorns

[Verse 2]
I never said I was perfect
Or you don't deserve a good person to carry your baggage
I know a few girls that can handle it
I ain't that kind of chick, but I can call 'em for you if you want
I never said that you wasn't attractive
Your style and that beard, ooh, don't get me distracted
I'm tryna be patient, and patience takes practice
The fact is I'm leaving, so just let me have this

[Chorus]
Jerome, Jerome
Take your ass home
And come back when you're grown, oh
Jerome, ooh, Jerome
Go on, take your ass home
Where the peaches have thorns

Thank God, thank God, thank God, I'm gettin' thicker
And I got 'em sweatin' in the middle of the winter

Okay, now spoon the yams, now stir the soup
That spoon, spoon, that spoon, spoon

Now she wanna trip on me 
I was doin' my thing, she was backin' it up
She was puttin' them hips on me
You know when your friend with the red hair was in town
You was puttin' them lips on me 
And I just keep gettin' lips from 'em
But I know what to do, I put dick on ya
Your friends like to talk 'bout the stuff that I do 
But your friends wanna fuck on me too 
And the way that you treat me, I wanna get even
I'm thinkin' like what should I do? 
But I know how you move outta spite
She bigger, I prolly might lose in a fight
And I'ma talk my shit, but I'm in love with her big fine ass
So I'ma do what she like
She told me

[Chorus: Lizzo & DaBaby]
Why're men great 'til they gotta be great? 

Don't text me, tell it straight to my face 
Best friend sat me down in the salon chair 
Shampoo press, get you out of my hair
Fresh photos with the bomb lighting 
New man on the Minnesota Vikings 
Truth hurts, needed something more exciting 
Bom bom bi dom bi dum bum bay 

[Verse 3: Lizzo]
You tried to break my heart?
Oh, that breaks my heart
That you thought you ever had it
No, you ain't from the start
Hey, I'm glad you're back with your bitch
I mean, who would wanna hide this?
I will never, ever, ever, ever, ever be your side chick
I put the sing in single
Ain't worried 'bout a ring on my finger
So you can tell your friend, "Shoot your shot" when you see 'em
It's okay, he already in my DMs

[Chorus: Lizzo]
Why're men great 'til they gotta be great? 
Don't text me, tell it straight to my face

Trust, baby, you can't make me beg or try to change, hey

Black, white, ebony all sound good to me
Two tone recipe, got good chemistry

Don't matter to me 'cause I like everything

You can be my lover
'Cause love looks better in color

Big dick energy 
Tastes like collard greens 
Big ass patty cake 
Hey, happy days

You can be my lover
'Cause love looks better in color

You can be my lover
'Cause love looks better in color

But love looks better in color

Looked at me, but I got annoyed
'Cause he bought me a drink for a dolla'
Boy came over and he wanted to holla'
Boy came over and he wanted to holla'
Boy came over and he wanted to holla'
My song came on, so I hit the dance floor
Man I lost my, mmm, phone
Walking home with my feet on sore

Walking home and it's damn near 4
Walking home and it's damn near 4

Pull this car over, babe

He said, "Why you cryin', baby?
Why you cryin', baby?
What did I do?" Oh
I said, shut up and kiss me, oh
'Cause I don't wanna be here for long

Ooh, ooh, ooh

You should feel honored boy, uh
You got me feelin' this much
I clear my schedule for you
Let my guard down for you
And you gon' make me put it back up

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Oh, you know why I'm cryin'
Why I'm cryin', baby
You don't pick up the phone
You do the same thing to your friends and family
You gon' end up alone

[Chorus]
I swore you'd never see this side
But it's so hard to say goodbye
I don't need to apologize
Us big girls got to cry

[Post-Chorus]
Ooh, ooh, ooh

Oh, I get a little lost sometimes
Sometimes you need to cry

[Chorus: Lizzo]
That's exactly how I feel
That's exactly how I feel

[Verse 1: Lizzo]
I woke up this morning 
Wrong side of the bed
I don't have to 'splain it, oh 
I might be a bitch 
I might make a friend 
Ain't I so amazing? 

[Pre-Chorus: Lizzo]
Love me or hate me
Ooh, I ain't changing
And I don't give a fuck, no

[Chorus: Lizzo]
That's exactly how I feel 
That's exactly how I feel

[Verse 2: Lizzo & Gucci Mane]
Don't hide no emotions 
Wear 'em on my sleeve 
All my feelings Gucci 
Can't hold back my tears
That would be a crime
'Cause I look pretty cryin'
Oh, they ain't tell you?

[Pre-Chorus: Lizzo]
Love me or hate me
Ooh, I ain't changing
And I don't give a fuck, no

[Chorus: Lizzo & Gucci Mane]
That's exactly how I feel

[Verse 3: Gucci Mane]
I feel like hurtin' they feelings 
I don't get mad, I get millions 
My heart ain't got no feelings
My cars ain't got no ceiling
I ain't with that acting all friendly
Please step away from the Bentley
You're either not with me or with me
The fye close by like it's Whitney
Stay in your lane, don't tempt me
Mr. Bust-A-Whole-Clip-'Til-It's-Empty
I got a feelin' that tonight's gonna be a good night
Like Ferg and them said, god willing
Fire chains on like burr 
Feelin' like rockin' my fur 
Rolls Royce with the chauffeur 
How your toes feel on a mink fur?
It's Gucci

[Pre-Chorus: Lizzo]
Cry 'cause I want to
Smile if I want to, huh
Yes, I can
Love 'cause I want to
Get so mad I could scream 
I could scream 
I could scream 
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

That's exactly how I feel 
That's exactly how I feel 
That's exactly how I feel

And if you wanna feel the thunder, baby
Better let me know
Let me know

Oh, here it goes, okay
Stop and smell my roses, posies
Appreciate my poses, they know
I'ma fanfare like the star-spangled
Oh, say, can you see my angles?
'Cause I'm hotter than the, I'm hotter than the stovetop
You can put your kettle on, but I'ma make the thing pop
No, I ain't talkin' 'bout my word, just my work
You can add it all up while I'm beefin' up my purse

[Chorus]
Hands to the sky, show me that you're mine 
Hands to the sky, show me that you're mine

Talking like boobies, you got a nice pair like some boobies
And you high off that doobie doobie with your Mystery Machine 
Feeling bad? Well you should be, BP don't make nothing cheapie
Hanging with them creepy creepies, I sitting in back with PPs
Lookin' holy holy while looking through them holy holies
Holy guacamole, you got that gooey now you a phony

[Verse 2: Sophia Eris]
Outside of the club
And I'm drip-drip-dripping sugar sweet
Cinnamon on skin with the hooligans
Y'all came to rock, and we came to ah!
Put a sting in her lips, [?] for the eye
Go on, take a sip, got milk in her thighs
[?] on sunny day from green tube and my high prices for the
Dream-dream, not cause i mean it means a thing to take from me
Unless it's just some DMT that's all up in my energy
Yup yup, go on place that bet
If you wanna come test in the mama's nest
With a bullet vest and curious chest
Got the ammo on the brain but I hide the best
Hey, I'm pumped up call me dough cooking
Gooey salty soul tookin', batches in a row lookin'
Magic as all hell, we livin', never ever will we give in
To a wack beat fuck with Lazerbeak in these mad streets
Get it, go there and we give it, haters will forbid it
They fall into the minutes because of imagination
Now the ones who in the nation, we the ones who need escapin'
Then we find some new ovens and we made it

[Verse 3: Lizzo]
Six-pence and land on the richer
Cut a niggah up and hung him like Jack the Ripper
Undo your zipper, get on your knees
And get ready for the industry in a nutshell 
Them goods don't get got if it's the only thing you got
Better keep them in that hot black pot
The only thing colder than the local talent, are the winters
Thrift store shopping, look like Anna Wintour
You ain't gotta ask about it cause I been hurr
Ridin' in them chariots like we in Ben Hur
Yah sure, ya know, yah sure, ya know, yah sure, ya know...
Rappin' and rappin' and I been steadily stackin'
I put these niggas in napkins and tuck 'em down for a nap
And apologies to the Capitol because I don't pay my capital
And if you happen to hear this then just pretend that you didn't at all, stall

[Hook]
I got my batches and cookies, I got my batches and cookies
I got my batches and cookies, I got my batches and cookies
Got my batches and cookies, I got my batches and cookies

I got my batches and cookies, I got my batches and cookies
Got my batches and cookies, I got my batches and cookies
I got my batches and cookies, I got my what?

[Outro]
Ooh, goo, cookies, cream
Ooh, goo, cookies, cream

[Chorus: Lizzo]
Let em say what they gonna say

Hey, you should too

[Chorus: Caroline Smith]
So let em say what they gonna say
They gonna feel how they gonna feel
But I love it
I love it, baby
Hey, you should too

[Verse 1: Lizzo]
Im just as thick as my skin is
I feel the water rolling down my back
Precipitations so repetitive
I read this all before
Interrogation to my hometown
Your comments leave me such a nasty taste
Cant feel the sound
Swish all around
A palate-cleanser for your salty mouth

[Pre-Chorus]
I know theyll never get enough
They dont get it, they dont get it
But if youre giving in then dont you change
Cause living well's the best revenge

[Chorus]
So let em say what they gonna say
They gonna feel how they gonna feel
But I love it
I love it, baby
Hey, you should too

Dont pay them no mind

[Verse 2: Caroline Smith]
Im not as thick as my skin is
Trying to stay strong
Stay tuned out at the top but
When youre running the business
I wish it was easy
Trying to work like a boss but
They keep shaking my patience
Dont wanna think like a man
Or look like a model
I wanna look like my momma
Five foot two and a natural woman

[Pre-Chorus]
I know theyll never get enough
They dont get it, they dont get it
But if youre giving in then dont you change
Cause living was the best revenge

[Chorus]
So let em say what they gonna say
They gonna feel how they gonna feel
But I love it
I love it, baby
Hey, you should too

[Intro]

Damn

[Verse 1]
Hair down, moonlit
Look at my lipstick
So thick, so fit
Wanna put your lips in places, ooh

Keep goin and goin' and keep it flowin', uh
You know what you doin, don't you?

[Chorus]
So I lounge around in my lingerie
I wanna be prepared for you just in case
So I lounge around in my lingerie
You better come my way

I don't got no secrets you don't know
These panties are see-through, I'm exposed, yeah
Treat you with my body, my eyes closed
Baby, let me feel you close
You make me crescendo, I'm going up
Ooh, ooh, ooh, yeah
Let's open the window
And let the world know
Oh, oh, oh

Booty vicious, mind yo business

[Verse 1]
I've been lifting heavy metal
See this ass? Ain't no rental
Take it down low like just stretching
Pick it back up like I'm flexing
Woo, tryna get it, working on my fitness

[Pre-Chorus]
Think about how I'm gonna feel when I step up on the catwalk
Think about how I'm gonna feel when I got that ass that don't stop
That ass that don't stop, that ass don't stop
And think about how I'm gonna feel when I take it all off

[Chorus]
Independent, athletic
I been sweating, doing calisthenics
Booty vicious, mind yo business
I been working, working on my fitness

[Post-Chorus]

[Pre-Chorus]
Think about how I'm gonna feel when I step up on the catwalk

That ass that don't stop, that ass don't stop
And think about how I'm gonna feel when I take it all off

[Intro]
Learning to love yourself and like learning to love your body is like a whole journey that I feel like every person, but more specifically, women, have to go through so I feel like doing this is a good way to kinda break through and kinda seal the last chapter of the "learning to love" and just loving..

[Verse 1]
Ooh, what's deeper than, what's deeper than the darkest best
Kept secret? Beneath the surface, we could
Let it bring us together, or it could tear us apart, oh
I'm filled with it, I gotta love with no conditions
Though it's hard to re-envision time and time again
Even when, even when it didn't matter anymore
The most beautiful thing that you ever seen
Is even bigger than what we think it means
Reflections in my bloodstreams, it's even bigger than

[Hook]
I woke up in this, I woke up in this
In my skin
I can't wash it away, so you can't take it from me
My brown skin

[Verse 2]
Real world, big girl meets world
A crazy position, now your dreams is your mission, huh?
Staring in the mirror, realizing, wish it worked
Now all I wish is for a chance to give my kids a Ford
I got a family tree that's worth praising the Lord
Mama looking like the second, whoo! Look at God
Sister like a soldier, hold it down
Southwest gon' hold it down, uh
I love you, don't forget it, you beautiful Black masterpiece!
Boy, they don't make brothers like you
Uh, make it happen with that Black girl magic
The hat trick off of what we must do

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Pardon me, just left a message to the city
Words stuck between my teeth, so gritty
Pay him for each minute I'm seething
A Black girl mixed with a little bit of Sacagawea
I pocket subpoenas, I swallow my pride and my ego
I wear my flaws on my sleeve and my skin like a peacoat
I see someone like me ashamed to be
And honestly, I'm really really
I'm fed up wit' it, try to send it up like a FedEx
I'm wondering what they sayin' next
Can't pretend to not hear it
It's your beauty, they can't have it
It's yours, they can't have it

[Interlude]
I'm done with the struggle. I wanna-I just wanna enjoy my life now and maybe appreciate my skin..

[Extended Hook]
I woke up in this, I woke up in this
In my skin
I can't wash it away, so you can't take it from me
My brown skin
Oh, I can't wash it away
No, you can't take it from me
My skin, your skin, yeah!
Oh, I can't wash it away
No, you can't take it from me
Ooh, my skin, ooh, my skin, yeah!

[Outro]
This is something I was born wit', you know? You can't buy this at a store, so hey..

[Intro]
I feel off

[Verse 1]
I feel off, I might love you, baby
I'd give my soul
You and I can't stand the feeling, I love it
The one you want, you can't fuck it up, yeah
No self-control 
Weed it out and come get your girl
Oh yeah, yeah 

[Pre-Chorus]
Call me, my long, long lost companion
Prove that my love is sometimes crazy 
Hold my hand a whole lot closer, whole lot closer
Feel it, I know, I know, I know 

[Chorus]
How deep is your love for me, baby?
Does it make your ass a donor?
How deep is your love for me, baby?

When you ask if I love ya, baby

You're wrong, you're right, you can't figure out
You're so defensive 
Play at night like insomnia, oh yeah, yeah, yeah

Call me, my long, long lost companion
Prove that my love is sometimes crazy
Hold my hand a whole lot closer, whole lot closer

Feel it I know, I know, I know

Hey-ee-ay, oh-a oh-a

[Bridge]
Cool up the wind now
Love will open the door
Cool up the wind now
Go and open that door
Love ain't a rodeo
I'll never rescue you
Love ain't no Romeo
Get what you're askin' for

[Chorus]
How deep is your love for me, baby?
Does it make your ass a donor?
How deep is your love for me, baby?

I try, I try to try, and see the love through human eyes

I try, I try to try, and see the love through human eyes

I try, I try to try, and see the love through human eyes

I try, I try to try, and see the love through human eyes


[Verse 1]
My hands are cold
My lips are tired, tryin' to blow 
To give them warmth
It's not enough, one heart alone
Cannot suffice
It simply can't, I've done the math
But in due time
There is no chance, for love

[Chorus]
I try to try 
I try, to try

[Verse 2]
Your skin is warm
It keeps me up though I am tired
Im tryin' to know
What else? Why else has this happened?
One man alone
Cannot suffice, Ive done the research
Ignore the role
Inside my bed, your lion features 
You can't lay on my shoulder
There are spikes and scales
And your cheek would just depress me
 a heavy haze, we love it
Love the taste of it, 
We love it, 

[Bridge]
Humanize me, baby
Humanize me, baby
I try!

[Hook]
I try to try, I, I 
I try to try, and see the love through human eyes
Who's gonna open the door?

[Break]



[Chorus]
I try, I try to try, and see the love through human eyes
I try, I try to try, and see the love through human eyes
I try, I try to try, and see the love through human eyes

I try, I try to try, and see the love through human eyes


[Outro]
You smell so good
Youre broke
Broken

[Verse 1]
LA carolin' with Carolyn
Caroline but I had to make it rhyme, I'm
Addicted to that weather like heroin
That is why I cannot give it any time, just say no!
It's too good to me, you are too good to me
O.D. on compliments, I need some oxygen
So I dip to the PNW, some of ya don't need where that is - good!
Need a little solitude with my crew
'Membering what's real is what makes you you, oh!
It's too good to me, know it's no good for me
I can't be out here homie, what it used to be
Sitting in bed like "man!", wishing
Itching for days with no end
Sound checks, checks in, audiences rapping
Getting full of that adrenaline, eat it up like Satan
You can't have it? Take it, you can't man up? K then
Breaking up my cadence, got that willpower like Jaden, blaow!

[Hook]
And we keep it going up
Make it go around, around, again
And we keep it going up
Going up
And we keep it going up
Make it go around, around, again
And we keep it going up
Going up

[Verse 2]
Flying into Paris with Sophia Eris
Had a heart-to-heart over fresh croissant
Wondering why these dudes be tripping
She like "Girl I'm past giving a damn!"
YOLO, guess that's why he want a photo
Dressed in Polo, arm around me after the show
But never there when I need hoes
Open mind but my heart closed, ah!
Where ya been? Back again, young man?
I remember you from way way when
You never gave it or reciprocated
But when I bounced for my sake, you peeped your mistake
"She left me" is always the excuse
I swear there should be support groups for men without Lizzo
Meet once a week and deal with y'all issues
Google me and jack off in a tissue

[Hook]
Yeah! You know what though?
We keep it going up
Make it go around, around, again
And we keep it going up
Going up
And we keep it going up
Make it go around, around, again
And we keep it going up
Going up

[Verse 3]
I will never be the person that you want me to
Feeling like I can't amount in what I'm 'sposed to do
But I'm here now, like how this happen?
Head in the pillows, I'm crunching on Cap'n
I'm chilling, I swear I been chilling
Taking a break, feeling hella breakable
I was taught that life has no regrets and no mistakes, no no
Bet I made some, granted
But my heart cold bruh, definitely definitely granite
Wrote this song halfway to Chicago
Wondering if I should call you
What, to make you feel special?
Would it give me reasons to forget you?

I'm out of state, out of time
You more like out of sight, out of mind

[Hook]
Yeah! You know what though?
We keep it going up
Make it go around, around, again
And we keep it going up
Going up
And we keep it going up
Make it go around, around, again
And we keep it going up
Going up

[Verse 1]
Uh, uh, uh, I'm in the, I'm in the, I'm in the
I'm in the business of making music, that music business
The fitness, no one can witness cause I
I make that crack music , uh
That real Black music 
The only singles that I'm dropping are the ones
Flapping at the band of your white briefs
White boys please! Can barely believe
I walk by as they hold they skeets by the seams of they jeans
C.R.E.A.M. get the money, and run it to the hills y'all
Straight into my pocket, tired of the deals dog
Start my own label, keep the leaking sealed off
If you got a big mouth, then you might get peeled off
I'm the only fat-lipped bass, my flipper--vroom!--peel off
Eating flounder, Sebastian's like some bath salts
Munching on his bones, looking at him like "It's yo' fault!"
"Look at what you made me do! Yo, pass the hot sauce"

[Verse 2]
Looking at the back of Sophia Eris's head
Eating a sammich 
Got a spider ass bite on my head, hangry
Feeling soupy, I brought my fuck in, yo I'm duckin'
Donald, Daffy, Howards, them cowards
Could never throw shots at a super with power
What was Russia without the czars?
What was Henry Ford without the cars?
My grandparents worked at Ford factory
So Henry is nothing without my family tree
And his slave-owning family needed Black blood still
So I think we need a spot up on Henry's will
That would never be the case, in case you ain't keeping up
I'm dishing out cases of that heavy bass
And them bassheads straight from the oppressor's loins
Are giving us our "Free us!" in hella coin

[Hook]
So bob your head crazy, bob your head crazy
Hip-hop, hip-hop turned crack from the era of crack babies
Bob your head crazy, bob your head crazy
Hip-hop, about to give oratories in stadiums and laboratories
Bob your head crazy, bob your head crazy
Hip-hop, hip-hop turned crack from the era of crack babies
Bob your head crazy, bob your head crazy
Hip-hop, about to give oratories--


[Bridge]
It don't matter how deep yo' pockets go
They still get they fill, fingers scrape the bottom
It don't matter how deep yo' soul is
They sho' is blinded by the light
It don't matter how deep yo' pockets go
They still get they fill, fingers scrape the bottom
It don't matter how deep yo' soul is
They sho' is blinded by the light!


[Hook]
Bob your head crazy, bob your head crazy
Hip-hop, hip-hop turned crack from the era of crack babies
Bob your head crazy, bob your head crazy
Hip-hop, about to give oratories in stadiums and laboratories
Bob your head crazy, bob your head crazy
Hip-hop, hip-hop turned crack from the era of crack babies
Bob your head crazy, bob your head crazy
Hip-hop, about to give oratories in stadiums and laboratories

[Outro]

Help you with your career just a little
You're 'posed to hold me down, but you're holding me back
And that's the sound of me not calling you back

[Chorus: Lizzo, Daehwi, Donghyun, Woong]
Why're men great 'til they gotta be great? 
Don't text me, tell it straight to my face

[Chorus: Lizzo, Daehwi, Donghyun, Woong]
Why're men great 'til they gotta be great?

[Outro: Lizzo]
With the bomb lighting
Minnesota Vikings
Yee, eh, yeah, yeah, yeah[Hook]
Like my hands in the air
Fingers kiss the sky
Smile on my lips, and I don't know why
I think I'm in love, I think I'm in love
I think I'm in love
With myself
I'm in love with myself, I'm in love with myself
I'm in love with myself, I'm in love

[Verse 1]
Kissing on my mirror
Staring in my eyes
Appreciating every curve and crevice
Smack my thighs
Smack it twice, watch it jiggle
You a bad batch cookie, cream filling in the middle
I'm a very picky girl
And yes you can call me mama
I got an A in self-esteem
So save the drama for Obama
Presidential in my stature
Statuesque and big as hell
If you in love with what you do, then leave them thirsties by the well
If they talking bout you, let 'em
You they entertainment
Reading you yo rights, just make it rain what they arrangin'
It's raining, it's pouring
Men and they're boring
Hallelujah thanking Jesus he made men so they could please us
All these years been searching for something that would complete me
Who knew that it would be me

[Hook]
I think I'm in love, I think I'm in love
I think I'm in love

[Verse 2]
Okay, this verse is about my best friend, bad as she can be
The only one that's on her level happens to be me
She'll give you a sprinkle, to them flounders bottom feeding
But ween 'em
As quick as she get that peen in
Ditch like a queen can
Skzzrt, after dinner I like that dessert
But he thirsty like he in the desert
What's worse, give it to him or get my own
Think I'm bout to hit him with that scissor
Cut, print, this scene is done
Nice to know, you all so nice to know
Level son, you on level one
I'm like ding, ding, ding, elevation
All my beautiful, big black beauty girls
Brown paper bag, [?] coke can, chill pants
Light skin, curly hair
Afro, in the air
Love yourself like nobody else can

[Hook]
Like my hands in the air
Fingers kiss the sky
Smile on my lips, and I don't know why
I think I'm in love, I think I'm in love
I think I'm in love
With myself
I'm in love with myself, I'm in love with myself
I'm in love with myself, I'm in love

[Outro]
Oh my god
Bionik, Bionik
Iconic, Iconic

[Verse]
My ni-hick-a, momma hiccup
Got to pick up the whole damn check plus the tip 'cause
Bosses right off they dinner
You lookin like, I say what I am the breadwinner
You a crip bruh, just the tip, cuz
Got to go how you say 'bouts the dim sum
Heavy setter , jet-setter 
Oh you too hotel me but
You ain't in the Best Western
Balls to wall in your courtroom
Objectify and undress you
'Til you the last one in the darkroom
Exposure bitch, don't get sued
Big business say forever, that's a mighty long time
A wise woman once told me even [?]

[Refrain]
And you can't see me
Even if you have binoculars
You can't see me
Even if you had glasses
You can't read me
All these bitches in the coup
Looking like Stevie

Yup, 'bout to post my list on the wall
Of the school auditroium
Tacked up neatly
Sheets upon sheets upon sheets
For weeks upon weeks upon weeks
That these people cold feet
I've got a tissue for you boo-hoos
Hip-hop guys 'round singing the blues
I ain't talking bout the rapper
I'm talking bout the gift beneath the wrappers
Called a happily ever after
Fact is, it ain't too late
You still been making them hits
Since the seventh grade
Big business, say forever
That's a mighty long time
A wise woman once told me

And you can't see me
Even if you have binoculars
You can't see me
Even if you have glasses
You can't read me

Rah Rah Rah

Uh, Ima pop a cherry today
Alright, Ima pop a cherry today
Ima pop a cherry today, no
Ima pop a cherry today
You can't murder
Runnin out the game 
Gettin locked up or
Gettin locked up
You know I used to get richWerk!
Werk like a Boss

[Verse 1]
Talk talk talk talk talk talk talk
That's what everybody and they mama wanna do
Whomp whomp whomp
Remote please, mute!
You can have your pennies and your two cent 'tude
(oh my God that's so messed up, how dare she say that in a song
Anti-fem, she's so wrong. I'm gonna post this on my blog)
Take a hike! Matter'o fact--jog
I've been running what took so long
I've been gunning for the top 
I've been reviving this thing, Ben Taub
If you took it upon yourself to take your self so literal
You're missing on the minerals to liberate your inner liberal
Generally i don't give a rat's patootie
But you pursued me
So here's my battle cry against those who slew me, who never knew me


[Hook]

Do I need to re-remind you that you sipping from the C-h-a-l-i-c-e
And I'm doing all this for the W-E?

[Bridge- Cliff Rhymes]
Getting dirt for the turf like a workaholic
But your worth cop a shirt 'cuz you work is na-na
Niggahs can't pay rent putting hustle in their mou-mou
Grasp for the raps for the stack when they can. Do
Slack, and I have to attack and offend you
Smashing these tracks...and that's what I'm into

[Verse 2]
Lookin like a girl cause I'm keeping it youthful
Such a freakin lady, classy and beautiful
Thinking like a man, for those who don't understand
Is having two grips to gain the upper hand
If you had the courage to give me reprimand to my face
Instead of slight of hand, you da Man!


[Hook]

[Verse 1]
I stopped talking to my mama for three months
No eye contact during lunch
Wasn't nothing else around us but mountains and trees
And my guilty worthless screams, "What was wrong with me?"
Was the question, it was, it was "How could she?"
What happen to a daddy girl when daddy don't exist no more?
I guess we gon' see

[Hook 1]
Wishing I could call you
You know when that bell ring
Angels get they wings
Someone tell me we gon'
Be alright but I think
That I gotta be
One deep
One deep, one deep

[Bridge]
Dip my black body in gold 
I just wanna shed 
Diamond crust 

[Verse 2]
Somebody put me on the soap box
I got the voice of my kin folk, my mama
Mama gave me blessings and then some
I'm youngest of two, feeling like a elder
Alone in my room, wishing I could tell ya
"I love you", "I love too"
The best of me only comes out when it's you
But sorry ain't in my vocabulary

[Hook 2]
Man you better call me
You know when that bell ring
I will be on time
Someone told me if we
Listen to our hearts then
We gon' be alright 
Four deep
Four deep

[Outro]
When I melted into your chest
Just read this and think about it
Talk to me in person

[Intro]
Have you ever been to Paris at night?
Say something French
[On va voir Lionel Richie au Znith ensemble a va tre cool]

[Verse 1]
Right out the gate, I'm flowin' individually
You owe me your check
Respecting a pony, I swear to God like a helmet
Free as I move booze
I'm paid to amuse you's
Amazed at how soon we could get this far
Broke off of mix tapes
Still broke off that mix tape
But I promise y'all that it won't last as long
'Cause me and my girls, delinquents
We renting jewels and the trinkets
Trumps bumping something fan fare when we arrive like

[Chorus]
Hard rap, card trap, made for the mall rat
Blast this, in ear, make them witness
Don't bother me when I'm on the road
You on mama's back
Drops it, drops it on the floor
Don't bother me when I'm on the road
You on mama's back
Drops it, drops it on the floor

[Verse 2]
I feel like any minute decision
With precision, I pick off
Make my selection on who I choose to crew with
Girl, don't touch us
I know you want us to slip but
Slippin' is something we don't do
Tippin' for life, grippin' that ice
You thirsty to wife, uh
We playing y'all home like bassoons
We going straight up like balloons
We fresh outta that saloon
We steady making y'all goals droop
With that vidal, with that sasoon
You been lost, where you been at?

[Chorus]
Hard rap, card trap, made for the mall rat
Blast this, in ear, make them witness
Don't bother me when I'm on the road
You on mama's back
Drops it, drops it on the floor
Don't bother me when I'm on the road
You on mama's back
Drops it, drops it on the floor

(Don't bother me
Don't bother me)

[Bridge]
I beg you, don't bother me when I'm on the road
You on mama's back
He drops it on the floor
My side dude complains and keeps it on the low
He touch himself to magazines
To pictures of his own

D-d-don't bother me, bother me
D-d-don't bother me, bother me
Bother me, bother me
Bother me, bother me
Bother me, bother me
Bother me, bother me

[Outro]
Ego
Been showing lovers their own selves
Covered in [?]
Pride
Without natural affection
Truth ablaze
Where you been at?
Where you been at?
Bother me, bother me, bother me

I been drinkin' on the vodka orange juice
It got me thinkin' about thinking of you
I been drinkin' on the vodka orange juice
And you know I, know I, know I loved you
Think 'bout you
But I don't got time for livin' side the comforts
Of my God damn time so I leave it up to me
You been sendin' all these broken signals
I just keep him asking what we could have done
You tell me that I am too ambitious
But I break the moulds and you just watch the stones roll
Watch the stones roll
Watch the stones roll
You watch my stone roll away from you
It didn't even take three days
Didn't even take me there
Didn't even take me there

[Verse 1]
B-B-B-B, B-B-B-B, B-B-Big GRRRL
S-S-S-S, S-S-S-S, S-S-Small World
I be-be-be-be-be-be-be steppin' on my deities
Sweet like diabetes, if you want me, hide and seek
I be flossin' super hard on your bumpin' gums
Ominous, music be like 
Lizzo never scared, bone crushin', you's a fuckin' ho
Vibrations spillin' from your head to your baby toe
Nigga, you's a baby fro, I be pick-ed out, soul glow
Actin' like you ain't been told
Summer's mine so please stay cold 
Summer's mine so please stay cold
Dinner's mine, eat yo' waffles

[Hook] 
Look like a girl, act 
Think like a man but work like a boss



[Verse 2]
I need to remind you that you talkin' to The Chalice
I am woman, hear me rawr, Queen of the Wonderland, not Alice
And if you wanna get wit' it, house so little, you not rented
Take out that mortgage and spend it and you'll get zero percentage
, I did it, if I did it, I meant it
Actions bring the pain like Dennis the Menace
Slingshot, David and Goliath on them boys
'Cept when this tree falls, yes, it will make a noise

Testosterone in the room, I break it up with estrogen
I ain't tryna get chose, I'm already chosen

[Hook]

[Verse 1]
Time's up, I'm jumpin' in the side door
Beside you, disposition those whole mild
A child to a mountain makin' milestones
Gemstones ain't got nothin' on my shine yo
Abide though, the rules I make for potholes
Shut it, I done done it, son it, niggas
Jigga's favorite new artist he ain't heard of
Prince give me mad dubs
Tighter than Michael Jackson's glove, the left one
A-hee-hee, wanna fall in love with me-hee?
And she-hee jelly, you ain't ready for it
And when you ready, I'll get Freddy, we get Jason on it
You complacent homie, you a pencil, I'm erasin' homie
Better get big trick
And as I wrote that, my pen ran out of ink
Now look up irony and tell me what you really think

[Chorus]
Have you ever been to Paris, at night?
Neither have I
Neither have I
Neither have I
Neither have I
Have you ever been to Paris, at night?
Neither have I
Neither have I
Neither have I
Neither have I

[Verse 2]
Have you ever been to Paris? Me neither
And if you said you did then I pro'ly won't believe ya
Got a cousin named Litha, ya pro'ly never meet her
'Cause they live in Detroit and that city be lethal
Can't buy liquor on a Sunday, what is you sayin'?
But beyond that man, a nigga can't explain
But beyond you, I could finally see the sand
Excuse me while I give myself a freakin' tan
Kill 'em all like I'm the freakin' Son of Sam
It's like I'm a Muslim and you a piece of ham, yuck
I would never touch ya
Rather, you will never touch me, good luck though

[Verse 3]
Runnin' and runnin' until I can't go
I clicked the picture that's in y'all's pocket
Part and polly up in lane, partly and polly out makin' particles
Sparkle, that glitter ain't gold, that glitter ain't gold at all
She lyin', you lyin', go flyin', the strike of the iron, that's hot
Step back from pitter pat, get that from the tit for tat
Rat-ta-ta-tatouille, right up when I find you
We sat back, recline, sit to we

[Chorus]
Paris, at night?
Neither have I
Neither have I
Neither have I
Neither have I
Have you ever been to Paris, at night?
Neither have I
Neither have I
Neither have I
Neither have I

[Outro]
Oui, oui

Voulez-vous coucher avec moi?
I'm in Paris nigga I'm in Paris
In the highway, eatin' croissants and drinkin' tea bitch

[Verse 1]
Inspiration? Let me think about it
Violation? No doubt about it
Man on the run, man under fire
They 'bout burn him up, the drones have him surrounded
Click, click, click, boom, pound it
Click, click, hashtag, pound sign it
It's on your trending map, co-sign it
But when they come, please do not run
Just open your mouth unto Zion
Big bear, little human
A lot of salt, a little cumin
Add it to the pot, and light it up
Pow pow pow pow pow pow pow pow
Pow pow pow pow pow pow pow pow

[Chorus]
We do mean harm
And you, please disarm
Don't say a word
If you do, we're terrible
We come in twos and ruin you

Click, click, boom
Click, click, boom
Click, click, click, boom
Click, click, boom
Click, click, boom
Click, click, click, boom
Lizzie Borden, Lizzie Borden, Lizzie Borden, Lizzie Borden

[Verse 2]
Runnin' up under the system, wonderin' if you can miss him
Coverin' up with a black scarf
Tell me the difference, you can't tell
Washing all the brains, nasty with the fangs
Shooting all the shooters, got my looters in this thing, like
"We don't give no fucks"
Plus we got the antidote, blacker than a quarter note
Play niggas like a pentatonic scale, go to hell
You don't know me, but I know you very well


[Bridge]
We
And you
Don't say a word
If you do, we're terrible
We come in twos and ruin you
We

You

Don't

Harm
We

You

Don't

Harm


[Chorus]
We do mean harm
And you, please disarm
Don't say a word
We do mean harm
And you, please disarm
Don't say a word
If you do, we're terrible
We come in twos and ruin you

[Outro]
I run nasty Liberace

[Intro]
Never cared for jingle bells or picking out a tree
I would rather paint my nails and watch some bad TV
But ever since we shared a kiss, I've been spreading the news
It never felt like Christmas 'til I spent it with you

[Verse 1]
Never cared for jingle bells or picking out a tree
I would rather paint my nails and watch some bad TV
But ever since we shared a kiss, I've been spreading the news
It never felt like Christmas

[Verse 2]
Sugar plums and candy canes, they did nothing for me
You could find me home alone and ordering Chinese
But now I save that old fruit cake 'cause there's enough for two
It never felt like Christmas 'til I spent it with
You, you, oh, you, you, you, you, you, you

[Verse 3]
The nutcracker was boring and the carolers off-key
I never saw a miracle on 50-something Street
But now I'm singing, bells are ringing, everything is new
I'm fa-la-la-la-la-ling into love with you, ooh ooh oh, you
All these years, I've been let down until you came around
It never felt like Christmas

[Verse 4]
January, February, April, March and May
Come and go when I'm alone, December felt the same
But when I see that red and green, now I don't feel so blue
It never felt like Christmas 'til I spent it with you

'Til I spent it with you, baby 
It never felt like Christmas 'til I spent it with youAw yeah, ha-ha-ha

South west alief Texas not born but raised
I was kicking it in the west
But mostly down in the trae
Or maybe montrose for a picnic
Galleria boy I was getting it
Playing shows spreading my name
But it was so hot the summer's insane
At South by South West
I was put to the Johnny test
They wanted a freestyle battle
Ok, pants vs dress
One little line
And them boys was impressed
Ditched the southwest to Minneapolis

I pull up to the Minne and get buck wild
Moving it shaking it by the pound
West bank, wild n out
Trying to see what thats all about
First ave was recently
My niggas sold it out for a week
I step on the stage
The scene was serene
They ask my name
Said it was Queen

I dont what that means
But I know that its good
Nefertiti flow gives you Anuksun wood
Estrogen's in this testosterone heir

So Im going to sit in my throne
And you can get in your chair
[repeat]


Im from that south west alief texas
Boy we reckless
Diamonds in our teeth
Shining brighter than your necklace
Aw snap, I got it like that
Writing raps to the boom bap
Setting off a click track
Lyrical, spherical, psych
Just mobbin
And if you got that guap
You better watch it cause we rob you

Ben Taub you, life support
Straight As in life check my progress report
Address my court with piercing eyes
Your knees are shaking cant hold your thighs
Im barely phased, hardly surprised
Ive been the queen, youre just another guy
Marty McFly, boy you better think
Im throwing everything at you like the kitchen sink

Yep, so you can sit in your chair x3
I going to sit in my throne and you can sit in your chair x3

Im throning [till end]

[Verse 1: Adam Levine]
Spent 24 hours

Making things right between us
But now it's all good, babe
Roll that backwood, babe, and play me close 

[Chorus: Adam Levine]

[Bridge: Adam Levine]
Maybe it's six forty-five, maybe I'm barely alive
Maybe you've taken my shit for the last time, yeah
Maybe I know that I'm drunk, maybe I know you're the one
Maybe I'm thinking it's better if you drive

[Verse 3: Cardi B]
Not too long ago, I was dancing for dollars 
Know it's really real if I let you meet my mama 
You don't want a girl like me, I'm too crazy
But every other girl you meet is fugazy 
I'm sure them other girls were nice enough
But you need someone to spice it up
So who you gonna call? Cardi, Cardi
Come and rev it up like a Harley, Harley
Why is the best fruit always forbidden? 
I'm coming to you now doin' 20 over the limit 
The red light, red light stop, stop 
I don't play when it comes to my heart, let's get it though
I don't really want a white horse and a carriage 
I'm thinkin' more a white Porsches and carats
I need you right here 'cause every time you're far
I play with this kitty like you play wit' your guitar, ah

[Chorus: Adam Levine]
'Cause girls like you
Run 'round with guys like me

Aren't we too grown for games?

There's a time that I remember, when I did not know no pain
When I believed in forever, and everything would stay the same

Everybody hurts sometimes
Everybody hurts someday, ayy-ayy

There's a time that I remember when I never felt so lost
When I felt all of the hatred was too powerful to stop 
Now my heart feel like an ember and it's lighting up the dark

Everybody hurts sometimes

And the more I drink, the more I think about you
Oh no, no, I can't take it
Baby, every place I go reminds me of you

[Pre-Chorus: Adam Levine]

Are you happy now?

And every time I go out, yeah

Yeah, I see but don't believe it
Even in my head, you're still in my bed
Maybe I'm just a fool

[Pre-Chorus: Adam Levine]
Do you think of me? Of what we used to be? 
Is it better now that I'm not around? 
My friends are actin' strange, they don't bring up your name

No more please stop
No more hashtag boo'd up screenshots
No more tryin' make me jealous on your birthday
You know just how I made you better on your birthday, oh
Do he do you like this, do he woo you like this?
Do he lay it down for you, touch your poona like this?
Matter fact, never mind, we'll let the past be
May be his right now, but your body's still me, whoa

[Chorus: Adam Levine]
I don't wanna know, know, know, know

Spent 24 hours, I need more hours with you
You spent the weekend getting even, ooh
We spent the late nights making things right between us

[Pre-Chorus]
But now it's all good, babe
Roll that Backwood, babe
And play me close

[Chorus]
'Cause girls like you run 'round with guys like me

Maybe it's 6:45
Maybe I'm barely alive
Maybe you've taken my shit for the last time 
Maybe I know that I'm drunk
Maybe I know you're the one
Maybe you're thinking it's better if you drive

[Chorus]
Oh, 'cause girls like you run 'round with guys like me

[Intro]
Ooh, ooh ooh ooh, ooh ooh, ooh ooh
Ooh, ooh ooh ooh, ooh ooh, ooh ooh

[Verse 1]
You and I go hard at each other like we're going to war
You and I go rough, we keep throwing things and slamming the doors
You and I get so damn dysfunctional, we stopped keeping score
You and I get sick, yeah, I know that we can't do this no more

[Pre-Chorus]
Yeah but baby, there you go again, there you go again, making me love you
Yeah, I stopped using my head, using my head
Let it all go
Got you stuck on my body, on my body like a tattoo
And now I'm feeling stupid, feeling stupid crawling back to you

[Chorus]
So I cross my heart, and I hope to die
That I'll only stay with you one more night
And I know I've said it a million times
But I'll only stay with you one more night

[Verse 2]
Try to tell you "no", but my body keeps on telling you "yes"
Try to tell you "stop", but your lipstick got me so out of breath
I'll be waking up in the morning, probably hating myself
And I'll be waking up, feeling satisfied, but guilty as hell

[Pre-Chorus]
Yeah but baby, there you go again, there you go again, making me love you 
Yeah, I stopped using my head, using my head
Let it all go 
Got you stuck on my body, on my body like a tattoo 
And now I'm feeling stupid, feeling stupid crawling back to you

[Chorus]
So I cross my heart, and I hope to die 
That I'll only stay with you one more night 
And I know I've said it a million times 
But I'll only stay with you one more night 

[Bridge]

Yeah, baby, give me one more night

Yeah, baby, give me one more night 

Yeah, baby, give me one more night
Oh yeah yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
But baby, there you go again, there you go again, making me love you
Yeah, I stopped using my head, using my head
Let it all go
Got you stuck on my body, on my body like a tattoo, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Chorus]
So I cross my heart, and I hope to die

That I'll only stay with you one more night

And I know I've said it a million times

But I'll only stay with you one more night

So I cross my heart and I hope to die 
That I'll only stay with you one more night 
And I know I've said it a million times 
But I'll only stay with you one more night 

[Chorus: Adam Levine]
I'm at a payphone, trying to call home
All of my change, I spent on you
Where have the times gone?
Baby, it's all wrong
Where are the plans we made for two?

[Verse 1: Adam Levine]
Yeah, I, I know it's hard to remember
The people we used to be
It's even harder to picture
That you're not here next to me
You say it's too late to make it
But is it too late to try?
And in our time that you wasted
All of our bridges burned down

[Pre-Chorus: Adam Levine]
I've wasted my nights
You turned out the lights
Now I'm paralyzed
Still stuck in that time when we called it love
But even the sun sets in paradise

[Chorus: Adam Levine]
I'm at a payphone, trying to call home
All of my change I spent on you
Where have the times gone? Baby, it's all wrong
Where are the plans we made for two?

[Post-Chorus: Adam Levine]
If "happy ever after" did exist
I would still be holding you like this
All those fairytales are full of shit
One more fucking love song, I'll be sick, oh

[Verse 2: Adam Levine]
You turned your back on tomorrow
'Cause you forgot yesterday
I gave you my love to borrow
But you just gave it away
You can't expect me to be fine
I don't expect you to care
I know I said it before
But all of our bridges burned down

[Pre-Chorus: Adam Levine]
I've wasted my nights
You turned out the lights
Now I'm paralyzed
Still stuck in that time when we called it love
But even the sun sets in paradise

[Chorus: Adam Levine]
I'm at a payphone, trying to call home
All of my change I spent on you 
Where have the times gone? Baby, it's all wrong
Where are the plans we made for two?

[Post-Chorus: Adam Levine]
If "happy ever after" did exist
I would still be holding you like this
And all those fairytales are full of shit
One more fucking love song, I'll be sick
Now, I'm at a payphone

[Verse 3: Wiz Khalifa]
Uh
Man, fuck that shit
I'll be out spending all this money
While you're sitting 'round wondering
Why it wasn't you who came up from nothing
Made it from the bottom
Now when you see me, I'm stuntin'
And all of my cars start with the push of a button
Telling me I changed since I blew up or whatever you call it
Switched the number to my phone so you never could call it
Don't need my name on my shirt, you can tell that I'm ballin'
Swish, what a shame, coulda got picked
Had a really good game, but you missed your last shot
So you talk about who you see at the top
Or what you could've saw, but sad to say it's over for
Phantom pulled up, valet open doors
Wished I'd go away, got what you was looking for
Now it's me who they want
So you can go take that little piece of shit with you

[Chorus: Adam Levine]
I'm at a payphone, trying to call home
All of my change I spent on you 
Where have the times gone? Baby, it's all wrong
Where are the plans we made for two? 

[Post-Chorus: Adam Levine]
If "happy ever after" did exist
I would still be holding you like this
And all these fairytales are full of shit
One more fucking love song, I'll be sick
Now, I'm at a payphone

[Chorus: Adam Levine]
Cold enough to chill my bones
It feels like I don't know you anymore
I don't understand why you're so cold to me
With every breath you breathe
I see there's something going on
I don't understand why you're so cold

[Verse 1: Adam Levine]
Are we taking time or a time out?
I can't take the in-between
Asking me for space here in my house
You know how to fuck with me
Acting like we're not together
After everything that we've been through
Sleeping up under the covers
How am I so far away from you?

[Pre-Chorus: Adam Levine]
Distant, when we're kissing
Feel so different
Baby, tell me how did you get so

[Chorus: Adam Levine]
Cold enough to chill my bones
It feels like I don't know you anymore
I don't understand why you're so cold to me
With every breath you breathe
I see there's something going on
I don't understand why you're so cold, yeah

[Post-Chorus: Adam Levine]
Whoa, yeah
Whoa, yeah
I don't understand why you're so cold

[Verse 2: Adam Levine]
What you holdin' on, holdin' on for?
If you wanna leave, just leave
Why you wanna bite your tongue for?
The silence is killing me
Acting like we're not together
If you don't want this, then what's the use?
Sleeping up under the covers
How am I so far away from you?

[Pre-Chorus: Adam Levine]
Distant , when we're kissing 
Feel so different 
Baby tell me how did you get so

[Chorus: Adam Levine]
Cold enough to chill my bones
It feels like I don't know you anymore
I don't understand why you're so cold to me
With every breath you breathe
I see there's something going on
I don't understand why you're so cold, yeah

[Post-Chorus: Adam Levine & Future]
Whoa, yeah
Whoa, yeah
I don't understand why you're so cold, yeah
So tough, its a cold world
Whoa, yeah
So tough, its a cold world
Whoa, yeah
So tough, its a cold world
I don't understand why you're so cold

[Verse 3: Future & Adam Levine]
Never thought that you were like this
I took the tag off, and made you priceless
I just spent half a mill' on a chandelier
Now you tryna cut me off like a light switch, yeah
Tryna stay in our league
Saying that you need some time to breathe
Thinking that I'm sleeping on the four-letter word
But the four-letter word don't sleep
We goin' two separate ways
You ain't been actin' the same
You gotta go, girl, where your heart used to be
You gold-dig every day
I switched the four-door to the two-door
'Cause I can't let my driver hear what you say
Girl, I tried to give you space
Baby, tell me how did you get so cold

[Chorus: Adam Levine]
Cold enough to chill my bones
It feels like I don't know you anymore
I don't understand why you're so cold to me
With every breath you breathe
I see there's something going on
I don't understand why you're so cold

[Post-Chorus: Adam Levine & Future]
So tough, its a cold world
Whoa, yeah
So tough, its a cold world
Whoa, yeah
So tough, its a cold world
I don't understand why you're so cold, yeah
So tough, its a cold world
Whoa, yeah
So tough, its a cold world
Whoa, yeah
So tough, its a cold world
I don't understand why you're so cold

[Verse 1]
Beauty queen of only eighteen
She had some trouble with herself
He was always there to help her
She always belonged to someone else
I drove for miles and miles
And wound up at your door
I've had you so many times
But somehow, I want more

[Chorus]
I don't mind spending every day
Out on your corner in the pouring rain
Look for the girl with the broken smile
Ask her if she wants to stay a while
And she will be loved
And she will be loved

[Verse 2]
Tap on my window, knock on my door
I want to make you feel beautiful
I know I tend to get so insecure
Doesn't matter anymore
It's not always rainbows and butterflies
It's compromise that moves us along, yeah
My heart is full and my door's always open
You come any time you want, yeah

[Chorus]
I don't mind spending every day
Out on your corner in the pouring rain
Look for the girl with the broken smile
Ask her if she wants to stay a while
And she will be loved
And she will be loved
And she will be loved
And she will be loved

[Bridge]
I know where you hide
Alone in your car
Know all of the things that make you who you are
I know that goodbye means nothing at all
Comes back and makes me catch her every time she falls, yeah
Tap on my window, knock on my door
I want to make you feel beautiful

[Chorus]
I don't mind spending every day
Out on your corner in the pouring rain, oh
Look for the girl with the broken smile
Ask her if she wants to stay a while
And she will be loved
And she will be loved
And she will be loved
And she will be loved

[Outro fading out]
I don't mind spending every day
Out on your corner in the pouring rain
Please don't try so hard to say goodbye

[Verse 1]
Dirty looks from your mother
Never seen you in a dress that color, no
It's a special occasion
Not invited, but I'm glad I made it, oh

[Pre-Chorus]
Let me apologize
I'll make up, make up, make up, make up for all those times 
Your love, I don't wanna lose
I'm beggin', beggin', beggin', beggin', I'm beggin' you

[Chorus]
Wait, can you turn around, can you turn around?
Just wait, can we work this out, can we work this out?
Just wait, can you come here please? 'Cause I wanna be with you
Wait, can you turn around, can you turn around?
Just wait, can we work this out, can we work this out?
Just wait, could you come here please? 'Cause I wanna be with you

[Verse 2]
Can we talk for a moment?
Got these feelings that I'm tired of holdin' on
Wasn't tryna get wasted
I needed more than three or four to say this, oh

[Pre-Chorus]
Let me apologize, yeah
I'll make up, make up, make up, make up for all those times 
Your love, I don't wanna lose 
I'm beggin', beggin', beggin', beggin', I'm begging you

[Chorus]
Wait, can you turn around, can you turn around? 
Just wait, can we work this out, can we work this out? 
Just wait, can you come here please? 'Cause I wanna be with you
Wait, can you turn around, can you turn around?
Just wait, can we work this out, can we work this out? 
Just wait, could you come here please? 'Cause I wanna be with you

[Bridge]
You say I'm just another bad guy
You say I've done a lot of things I can't undo
Before you tell me for the last time, yeah
I'm beggin', beggin', beggin', beggin', beggin' you

[Chorus]
Wait, can you turn around, can you turn around?
Just wait, can we work this out, can we work this out? 
Just wait, can you come here please? 'Cause I wanna be with you 
Wait, can you turn around, can you turn around?
Just wait, can we work this out, can we work this out?
Just wait, could you come here please? 'Cause I wanna be with you[Directed by David Dobkin]

[Verse 1]
I'm hurting baby, I'm broken down
I need your loving, loving I need it now
When I'm without you, I'm something weak
You got me begging, begging I'm on my knees

[Pre-Chorus]
I don't wanna be needing your love
I just wanna be deep in your love
And it's killing me when you're away
Ooh baby
'Cause I really don't care where you are
I just wanna be there where you are
And I gotta get one little taste

[Chorus]
Sugar, yes please
Won't you come and put it down on me?
I'm right here, 'cause I need
Little love, a little sympathy
Yeah, you show me good loving, make it alright
Need a little sweetness in my life
Your sugar, yes please
Won't you come and put it down on me?

[Verse 2]
Babe, my broken pieces, you pick them up
Don't leave me hanging, hanging
Come give me some
When I'm without you, I'm so insecure
You are the one thing, one thing I'm living for

[Pre-Chorus]
I don't wanna be needing your love
I just wanna be deep in your love
And it's killing me when you're away
Ooh baby
'Cause I really don't care where you are
I just wanna be there where you are
And I gotta get one little taste

[Chorus]
Sugar, yes please
Won't you come and put it down on me?
I'm right here, 'cause I need
Little love, a little sympathy
Yeah, you show me good loving, make it alright
Need a little sweetness in my life
Your sugar, yes please 
Won't you come and put it down on me?

[Bridge]
Yeah
I want that red velvet
I want that sugar sweet
Don't let nobody touch it unless that somebody's me
I gotta be a man, there ain't no other way
'Cause girl you're hotter than a Southern California day
Never wanna play no games, you don't gotta  be afraid
Don't give me all that shy shit
No makeup on, that's my sugar

[Chorus]
Sugar, yes please 
Won't you come and put it down on me? 
I'm right here, 'cause I need 
Little love, a little sympathy
Yeah, you show me good loving, make it alright

Little love, a little sympathy
Yeah, you show me good loving, make it alright
Need a little sweetness in my life
Your sugar, yes please 
Won't you come and put it down on me?
[Verse 1]
I miss the taste of a sweeter life
I miss the conversation
I'm searching for a song tonight
I'm changing all of the stations
I like to think that we had it all
We drew a map to a better place
But on that road I took a fall
Oh, baby, why did you run away?

[Pre-Chorus]
I was there for you
In your darkest times
I was there for you
In your darkest night

[Chorus]
But I wonder, where were you?
When I was at my worst
Down on my knees
And you said you had my back
So I wonder, where were you?
All the roads you took came back to me
So I'm following the map that leads to you

[Post-Chorus]
The map that leads to you
Ain't nothing I can do
The map that leads to you
Following, following, following to you
The map that leads to you
Ain't nothing I can do
The map that leads to you
Following, following, following

[Verse 2]
I hear your voice in my sleep at night
Hard to resist temptation
'Cause something strange has come over me
Now, I can't get over you
No, I just can't get over you

[Pre-Chorus]
I was there for you
In your darkest times
I was there for you
In your darkest night

[Chorus]
But I wonder, where were you?
When I was at my worst
Down on my knees
And you said you had my back
So I wonder, where were you?
All the roads you took came back to me
So I'm following the map that leads to you

[Post-Chorus]
The map that leads to you
Ain't nothing I can do
The map that leads to you
Following, following, following to you
The map that leads to you
Ain't nothing I can do
The map that leads to you

[Bridge]
Oh, oh, oh, ah
Ooh, oh, oh, ah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, ah
Aha, ah, mmm, ah

Oh, I was there for you
Oh, in your darkest times
Oh, I was there for you
Oh, in your darkest night

[Chorus]
But I wonder, where were you?
When I was at my worst
Down on my knees
And you said you had my back
So I wonder, where were you?
All the roads you took came back to me
So I'm following the map that leads to you
The map that leads to you
Ain't nothing I can do
The map that leads to you
Following, following, following to you
The map that leads to you
Ain't nothing I can do
The map that leads to you
Following, following, following

[Chorus]
Baby, I'm preying on you tonight
Hunt you down, eat you alive
Just like animals, animals, like animals-mals
Maybe you think that you can hide
I can smell your scent from miles
Just like animals, animals, like animals-mals
Baby, I'm... 

[Verse 1]
So what you trying to do to me? 
It's like we can't stop, we're enemies 
But we get along when I'm inside you, yeah 
You're like a drug that's killing me 
I cut you out entirely 
But I get so high when I'm inside you

[Pre-Chorus]
Yeah, you can start over, you can run free 
You can find other fish in the sea 
You can pretend it's meant to be 
But you can't stay away from me
I can still hear you making that sound 
Taking me down, rolling on the ground 
You can pretend that it was me, but no, oh 

[Chorus]
Baby, I'm preying on you tonight
Hunt you down, eat you alive
Just like animals, animals, like animals-mals
Maybe you think that you can hide
I can smell your scent from miles
Just like animals, animals, like animals-mals
Baby, I'm... 

[Verse 2]
So if I run, it's not enough 
You're still in my head, forever stuck 
So you can do what you wanna do, yeah 
I love your lies, I'll eat 'em up 
But don't deny the animal 
That comes alive when I'm inside you

[Pre-Chorus]
Yeah, you can start over, you can run free 
You can find other fish in the sea 
You can pretend it's meant to be
But you can't stay away from me
I can still hear you making that sound 
Taking me down, rolling on the ground 
You can pretend that it was me, but no, oh 

[Chorus]
Baby, I'm preying on you tonight
Hunt you down, eat you alive
Just like animals, animals, like animals-mals
Maybe you think that you can hide
I can smell your scent from miles
Just like animals, animals, like animals-mals
Baby, I'm...

[Bridge]
Don't tell no lie, lie, lie, lie
You can't deny-ny-ny-ny
The beast inside, si-si-side
Yeah, yeah, yeah
No girl don't lie, lie, lie, lie 
You can't deny-ny-ny-ny 
The beast inside, si-si-side
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yo-oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Just like animals, animals, like animals-mals 
Just like animals, animals, like animals-mals, oww!


[Chorus]
Baby, I'm preying on you tonight
Hunt you down, eat you alive
Just like animals, animals, like animals-mals
Maybe you think that you can hide
I can smell your scent from miles
Just like animals, animals, like animals-mals
Baby, I'm...

[Outro]
Don't tell no lie, lie, lie, lie
You can't deny-ny-ny-ny
The beast inside, si-si-side
Yeah, yeah, yeah
No girl don't lie, lie, lie, lie 
You can't deny-ny-ny-ny 
The beast inside, si-si-side
Yeah, yeah, yeah

[Intro]
Yeah

[Verse 1]
Sunday morning, rain is falling
Steal some covers, share some skin 
Clouds are shrouding us in moments unforgettable
You twist to fit the mold that I am in

[Refrain]
But things just get so crazy, living life gets hard to do
And I would gladly hit the road, get up and go if I knew
That someday, it would lead me back to you
That someday, it would lead me back to you 

[Chorus]
That may be all I need
In darkness, she is all I see
Come and rest your bones with me
Driving slow on Sunday morning
And I never want to leave

[Verse 2]
Fingers trace your every outline
Paint a picture with my hands
Back and forth, we sway like branches in a storm
Change the weather, still together when it ends

[Chorus]
That may be all I need
In darkness, she is all I see
Come and rest your bones with me
Driving slow on Sunday morning
And I never want to leave

[Refrain]
Oh yeah, but things just get so crazy, living life gets hard to do
Sunday morning, rain is falling and I'm calling out to you
Singing, someday it'll bring me back to you 
Find a way to bring myself back home to you

[Chorus]
And you may not know
That may be all I need
In darkness, she is all I see 
Come and rest your bones with me
Driving slow on Sunday morning
Driving slow, ooh, yeah, yeah...

[Outro]
It's a flower in your hair
I'm a flower in your hair

[Verse 1]
I was so high I did not recognize
The fire burning in her eyes
The chaos that controlled my mind
Whispered goodbye as she got on a plane
Never to return again
But always in my heart

[Chorus]
This love has taken its toll on me
She said goodbye too many times before
And her heart is breaking in front of me
And I have no choice, 'cause I won't say goodbye anymore

[Verse 2]
I tried my best to feed her appetite
Keep her coming every night
So hard to keep her satisfied
Keep playing love like it was just a game
Pretending to feel the same
Then turn around and leave again

[Chorus]
This love has taken its toll on me
She said goodbye too many times before
And her heart is breaking in front of me
And I have no choice, 'cause I won't say goodbye anymore

[Bridge]
I'll fix these broken things
Repair your broken wings
And make sure everything's alright 
My pressure on your hips
Sinking my fingertips
Into every inch of you
'Cause I know that's what you want me to do

[Chorus]
This love has taken its toll on me
She said goodbye too many times before
And her heart is breaking in front of me
And I have no choice, 'cause I won't say goodbye anymore
This love has taken its toll on me
She said goodbye too many times before
And my heart is breaking in front of me
She said goodbye too many times before
This love has taken its toll on me
She said goodbye too many times before
And her heart is breaking in front of me
I have no choice, 'cause I won't say goodbye anymore

[Verse 1: Adam Levine]
Oh
Oh

[Verse 1: Adam Levine]
Just shoot for the stars
If it feels right, then aim for my heart
If you feel like
And take me away
And make it okay
I swear I'll behave
You wanted control, so we waited
I put on a show, now I'm naked
You say I'm a kid
My ego is big
I don't give a shit
And it goes like this, uh

[Chorus: Adam Levine]
Take me by the tongue and I'll know you 
Kiss me till you're drunk and I'll show you
You want the moves like Jagger
I've got them moves like Jagger
I've got them moves like Jagger 
I don't needa try to control you 
Look into my eyes and I'll own you
With them moves like Jagger
I've got them moves like Jagger
I've got them moves like Jagger

[Verse 2: Adam Levine]
Baby, it's hard, when you feel like
You're broken and scarred, nothing feels right
But when you're with me
I'll make you believe
That I've got the key
Oh, so get in the car, we can ride it
Wherever you want, get inside it
And you wanna steer, but I'm shifting gears
I'll take it from here 
And it goes like this, uh

[Chorus: Adam Levine & ]
Take me by the tongue and I'll know you 
Kiss me till you're drunk and I'll show you
You want the moves like Jagger
I've got them moves like Jagger
I've got them moves like Jagger 
I don't need to try to control you 
Look into my eyes and I'll own you
With them moves like Jagger
I've got them moves like Jagger 
I've got them moves like Jagger

[Bridge: Christina Aguilera & Adam Levine]
Uh, you wanna know, how to make me smile?
Take control, own me just for the night
And if I share my secret
You're gonna have to keep it
Nobody else can see this 
So watch and learn, I won't show you twice
Head to toe, ooh baby, rub me right
And if I share my secret
You're gonna have to keep it
Nobody else can see this
Hey, hey, hey, yeah
And it goes like this, uh

[Chorus: Adam Levine & Christina Aguilera]
Take me by the tongue and I'll know you 
Kiss me till you're drunk and I'll show you 
You want the moves like Jagger
I've got the moves like Jagger
I've got the moves like Jagger 
I don't needa try to control you 
Look into my eyes and I'll own you 
With them moves like Jagger
I've got them moves like Jagger
I've got them moves like Jagger

[Chorus: Adam Levine]
Leaves are fallin', it's September
The night came in, it made her shiver
I told her she could have my jacket
Wrapped it tight around her shoulders
And I was so young 'til she kissed me
Like a whiskey, like a whiskey

[Verse 1: Adam Levine]
I never knew that love was blind
'Til I was hers, but she was never mine
Yeah, I was reckless
But I let it burn, I let it burn, yeah
The feelin', it was bittersweet
Realizin' I was in too deep
She was a lesson
I had to learn, I had to learn, yeah

[Pre-Chorus: Adam Levine]
I used to try to forget her
But now I smile when I remember
Ooh

[Chorus: Adam Levine]
Leaves are fallin' in September
The night came in, it made her shiver
I told her she could have my jacket
Wrapped it tight around her shoulders
And I was so young 'til she kissed me
Like a whiskey, like a whiskey
Ooh, like a whiskey, ooh

[Verse 2: Adam Levine]
Would've left this world behind
Just to wake up by your side
Every mornin', I would've sold my soul for a lil' more time
Would've waited a thousand nights
If she never said goodbye
I admit that I
Would've sold my soul for a little more time
Ooh

[Pre-Chorus: Adam Levine]
I used to try to forget her
But now I smile when I remember

[Chorus: Adam Levine]
Leaves are fallin', it's September
The night came in, it made her shiver
I told her she could have my jacket
Wrapped it tight around her shoulders
And I was so young 'til she kissed me
Like a whiskey, like a whiskey

[Verse 3: A$AP Rocky]
I ain't like the other Cognacs
Or type of cat that'd never call back
Or lose contact when you runnin' out of rum and you make a run

All of that tequila's a killer, little vodka
Break her off somethin' proper
Pop a cork and play spin the bottle

Punch drunk love, it's a fine line
Dom Prignon, she the fine wine
Someone call 911, I'm runnin' out of time
She done got off with my heart

[Chorus: Adam Levine & ]
Leaves are fallin', it's September 
The night came in, it made her shiver
I told her she could have my jacket
Wrapped it tight around her shoulders
And I was so young 
'Til she kissed me 
Like a whiskey 
And I was so young 
'Til she kissed me
Like a whiskey, like a whiskey

[Verse 1]
You keep me connected to you like I was your shadow
You're giving me answers to all of my questions here on my pillow, oh
Can't nothing get in between us, baby
We've been waiting on this moment for so long
You wanna be reckless, restless, right until tomorrow
Wait

[Chorus]
When I put my lips on you
You feel the shivers go up and down your spine for me
Make you cry for me
When I put my lips on you
I hear your voice echoing all through the night for me
Baby, cry for me
When I put my lips on you 
When I put my lips on you 

[Verse 2]
Just turn off the lights and you can be my private dancer
When we close the curtains
You and me can forget all our manners, oh
The neighbors must think that we're crazy, baby
'Cause look how easily we keep coming undone
You wanna be reckless, restless, right until tomorrow
Wait

[Chorus]
When I put my lips on you
You feel the shivers go up and down your spine for me
Make you cry for me
When I put my lips on you
I hear your voice echoing all through the night for me
Baby, cry for me
When I put my lips on you 
When I put my lips on you 
When I put my lips on you 
When I put my lips on you 

[Chorus]
When I put my lips on you
You feel the shivers go up and down your spine for me
Make you cry for me
When I put my lips on you
I hear your voice echoing all through the night for me
Baby, cry for me
Baby, when I put my lips on you 
When I put my lips on you 
When I put my lips on you 
When I put my lips on you 

[Verse 1]
Here I am waiting
I'll have to leave soon
Why am I holding on?
We knew this day would come
We knew it all along
How did it come so fast?

[Pre-Chorus]
This is our last night, but it's late
And I'm trying not to sleep
'Cause I know, when I wake
I will have to slip away

[Chorus]
And when the daylight comes, I'll have to go
But tonight I'm gonna hold you so close
'Cause in the daylight, we'll be on our own
But tonight I need to hold you so close
Ooh-whoa, ooh-whoa, ooh-whoa
Ooh-whoa, ooh-whoa, ooh-whoa

[Verse 2]
Here I am staring at your perfection
In my arms, so beautiful
The sky is getting bright
The stars are burning out
Somebody slow it down

[Pre-Chorus 2]
This is way too hard
'Cause I know, when the sun comes up
I will leave, this is my last glance
That will soon be memory

[Chorus]
And when the daylight comes, I'll have to go
But tonight I'm gonna hold you so close
'Cause in the daylight, we'll be on our own
But tonight, I need to hold you so close
Ooh-whoa, ooh-whoa, ooh-whoa
Ooh-whoa, ooh-whoa, ooh-whoa

[Bridge]
I never want it to stop
Because I don't wanna start all over, start all over
I was afraid of the dark
But now it's all that I want, all that I want, all that I want

[Chorus]
And when the daylight comes, I'll have to go
But tonight I'm gonna hold you so close
'Cause in the daylight, we'll be on our own
But tonight I need to hold you so close
And when the daylight comes I'll have to go
But tonight I'm gonna hold you so close
'Cause in the daylight, we'll be on our own
But tonight I need to hold you so close
Ooh-whoa, ooh-whoa, ooh-whoa
Ooh-whoa, ooh-whoa, ooh-whoa

[Outro]
Ooh-whoa , ooh-whoa , ooh-whoa 
Ooh-whoa , ooh-whoa , ooh-whoa

[Chorus]
This summer's gonna hurt like a motherfucker, fucker
This summer's gonna hurt like a motherfucker, fucker

[Verse 1]
Her body's hot
Her body's like the summer
I'm in a trance or something
Her mind is not, no
As sharp as all her diamonds
She must be smoking something

[Pre-Chorus]
I see her dancing in the streets
Sipping champagne on the beach
So expensive when she eats
'Cause she's so fancy
I see her when I go to sleep
I check my phone when I am weak
She never posts anything deep
'Cause she's so fancy

[Chorus]
This summer's gonna hurt like a motherfucker, fucker
This summer's gonna hurt like a motherfucker, fucker

[Verse 2]
She wants it all
She's always taking something
And now I'm left with nothing
I'm ripping off, oh
I'm ripping off that bandage
Because I just can't stand it

[Pre-Chorus]
I see her dancing on a fool
Like she's seventeen and cool
She really thinks that she can move
But it's just nasty
I see her when I go to sleep
I check my phone when I am weak
She never posts anything deep
'Cause she's so fancy

[Chorus]
This summer's gonna hurt like a motherfucker, fucker
This summer's gonna hurt like a motherfucker, fucker

[Bridge]
Has to have it all, chases every star, she's so popular 
Has to have it all, chases every star, she's so popular, oh
This summer's gonna hurt, it's gonna hurt
I see her dancing in the street
Sipping champagne on the beach
So expensive when she eats
'Cause she's so fancy
'Cause she's so fancy

[Chorus]
This summer's gonna hurt like a motherfucker, fucker
This summer's gonna hurt like a motherfucker, fucker
This summer's gonna hurt like a motherfucker, fucker
This summer's gonna hurt like a motherfucker, fucker
This summer's gonna hurt like a motherfucker

[Verse 1]
I know your insides are feeling so hollow
And it's a hard pill for you to swallow, yeah
But if I fall for you, I'll never recover
If I fall for you, I'll never be the same

[Chorus]
I really wanna love somebody
I really wanna dance the night away
I know we're only half way there
But you take me all the way, you take me all the way
I really wanna touch somebody
I think about you every single day
I know we're only half way there
But you take me all the way, you take me all the way

[Verse 2]
You're such a hard act for me to follow
Love me today, don't leave me tomorrow, yeah
But if I fall for you, I'll never recover
If I fall for you, I'll never be the same

[Chorus]
I really wanna love somebody
I really wanna dance the night away
I know we're only half way there
But you take me all the way, you take me all the way
I really wanna touch somebody
I think about you every single day
I know we're only half way there
But you take me all the way, you take me all the way

[Break]
Oh, oh, oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh-oh-oh

[Bridge]
I don't know where to start, I'm just a little lost
I wanna feel like we're never gonna ever stop
I don't know what to do, I'm right in front of you
Asking you to stay, you should stay, stay with me tonight, yeah

[Chorus]
I really wanna love somebody
I really wanna dance the night away
I know we're only half way there
But you take me all the way, you take me all the way
I really wanna touch somebody
I think about you every single day
I know we're only half way there
But you take me all the way, you take me all the way

[Break]
Oh, oh, oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh-oh-oh

[Outro]
You take me all the way, you take me all the way, yeah

[Intro]
I'm at a payphone, trying to call home
All of my change, I spent on you
Where have the times gone?
Baby, it's all wrong
Where are the plans we made for two?

[Verse 1]
Yeah, I, I know it's hard to remember
The people we used to be
It's even harder to picture
That you're not here next to me
You say it's too late to make it
But is it too late to try?
And in our time that you wasted
All of our bridges burned down

[Pre-Chorus]
I've wasted my nights
You turned out the lights
Now I'm paralyzed
Still stuck in that time when we called it love
But even the sun sets in paradise

[Chorus]
I'm at a payphone, trying to call home
All of my change I spent on you
Where have the times gone? Baby, it's all wrong
Where are the plans we made for two?
If happy ever after did exist
I would still be holding you like this
All those fairytales are full of it
One more stupid love song, I'll be sick, oh

[Verse 2]
You turned your back on tomorrow
'Cause you forgot yesterday
I gave you my love to borrow
But you just gave it away
You can't expect me to be fine
I don't expect you to care
I know I said it before
But all of our bridges burned down

[Pre-Chorus]
I've wasted my nights
You turned out the lights
Now I'm paralyzed
Still stuck in that time when we called it love
But even the sun sets in paradise

[Chorus]
I'm at a payphone, trying to call home
All of my change I spent on you
Where have the times gone? Baby, it's all wrong
Where are the plans we made for two?
If happy ever after's did exist
I would still be holding you like this
And all those fairytales are full of it
One more stupid love song, I'll be sick
Now, I'm at a payphone

[Bridge]
Ooh, yeah, yeah
Now baby, don't hang up
So I can tell you what you need to know
I'm begging you, just please don't go
So I can tell you what you need to know

[Chorus]
Yeah, I'm at a payphone, trying to call home
All of my change I spent on you
Where have the times gone? Baby, it's all wrong
Where are the plans we made for two?
If happy ever after did exist
I would still be holding you like this
And all these fairytales are full of it
One more stupid love song, I'll be sick
Now, I'm at a payphone

[Intro]
Oh yeah
Oh yeah

[Verse 1]
So scared of breaking it that you won't let it bend
And I wrote two hundred letters I will never send
Sometimes these cuts are so much deeper than they seem
You'd rather cover up, I'd rather let them bleed
So let me be, and I'll set you free 

[Chorus]
I am in misery
There ain't nobody who can comfort me 
Why won't you answer me?
The silence is slowly killing me, oh yeah

[Post Chorus]
Girl, you really got me bad
You really got me bad
Now I'm gonna get you back
I'm gonna get you back

[Verse 2]
Your salty skin and how it mixes in with mine
The way it feels to be completely intertwined
Not that I didn't care, it's that I didn't know
It's not what I didn't feel, it's what I didn't show
So let me be, and I'll set you free

[Chorus]
I am in misery
There ain't nobody who can comfort me 
Why won't you answer me?
The silence is slowly killing me 

[Post-Chorus]
Girl, you really got me bad
You really got me bad
Now I'm gonna get you back
I'm gonna get you back, yeah

[Bridge]
You say your faith is shaken, and you may be mistaken
You keep me wide awake and waiting for the sun
I'm desperate and confused, so far away from you
I'm getting there, I don't care where I have to roam

[Refrain]
Why do you do what you do to me? Yeah
Why won't you answer me, answer me? Yeah
Why do you do what you do to me? Yeah
Why won't you answer me, answer me? Yeah

[Chorus]
I am in misery
There ain't nobody who can comfort me 
Why won't you answer me?
The silence is slowly killing me 

[Post-Chorus]
Girl, you really got me bad
You really got me bad
Now I'm gonna get you back
I'm gonna get you back

[Outro]
Girl, you really got me bad
You really got me bad
Now I'm gonna get you back
I'm gonna get you back
Girl, you really got me bad
You really got me bad
Now I'm gonna get you back
I'm gonna get you back
Girl, you really got me bad
You really got me bad
Now I'm gonna get you back
I'm gonna get you back

[Verse 1]
How dare you say that my behavior's unacceptable
So condescending unnecessarily critical
I have the tendency of getting very physical
So watch your step, 'cause if I do, you'll need a miracle
You drain me dry and make me wonder why I'm even here
The double vision I was seeing is finally clear
You want to stay, but you know very well I want you gone
Not fit to fuckin' tread the ground that I am walking on

[Chorus]
But when it gets cold outside and you got nobody to love
You'll understand what I mean when I say
"There's no way we're gonna give up"
And like a little girl cries in the face of a monster that lives in her dreams

[Post-Chorus]
Is there anyone out there?
'Cause it's getting harder and harder to breathe
Is there anyone out there?
'Cause it's getting harder and harder to breathe

[Verse 2]
What you are doing is screwing things up inside my head
You should know better, you never listened to a word I said
Clutching your pillow and writhing in a naked sweat
Hoping somebody someday will do you like I did

[Chorus]
But when it gets cold outside and you got nobody to love
You'll understand what I mean when I say
"There's no way we're gonna give up"
And like a little girl cries in the face of a monster that lives in her dreams

[Post-Chorus]
Is there anyone out there?
'Cause it's getting harder and harder to breathe
Is there anyone out there?
'Cause it's getting harder and harder to breathe

[Guitar Solo]

[Bridge]
Does it kill
Does it burn
Is it painful to learn
That it's me that has all the control?
Does it thrill
Does it sting
When you feel what I bring
And you wish that you had me to hold?

[Chorus]
But when it gets cold outside and you got nobody to love
You'll understand what I mean when I say
"There's no way we're gonna give up"
And like a little girl cries in the face of a monster that lives in her dreams

[Post-Chorus]
Is there anyone out there?
'Cause it's getting harder and harder to breathe
Is there anyone out there?
'Cause it's getting harder and harder to breathe

[Outro]
Is there anyone out there?
'Cause it's getting harder and harder to breathe

[Verse 1]
Wake up, blood-shot eye
Struggle to memorize
The way it felt between your thighs
Pleasure that made you cry
It feels so good to be bad
Not worth the aftermath, after that, after that
Try to get you back

[Pre-Chorus]
I still don't have a reason
And you don't have the time
And it really makes me wonder if I ever gave a fuck about you

[Chorus]
Give me something to believe in
'Cause I don't believe in you anymore, anymore
I wonder if it even makes a difference to try
Yeah, so this is goodbye

[Verse 2]
God damn my spinning head
Decisions that made my bed
Now I must lay in it
And deal with things I've left unsaid
I want to dive into you
Forget what you're going through
I get behind, make your move
Forget about the truth

[Pre-Chorus]
I still don't have a reason
And you don't have the time
And it really makes me wonder if I ever gave a fuck about you

[Chorus 2]
Give me something to believe in
'Cause I don't believe in you anymore, anymore
I wonder if it even makes a difference
It even makes a difference to try, yeah
And you told me how you're feeling
But I don't believe it's true anymore, anymore
I wonder if it even makes a difference to cry
Oh no, so this is goodbye

[Bridge]
Ho-oh-oh-oh
I've been here before
One day I'll wake up and it won't hurt anymore
You caught me in a lie
I have no alibi
The words you say don't have a meaning

[Pre-Chorus 2]
'Cause I still don't have a reason
And you don't have the time
And it really makes me wonder if I ever gave a fuck about you and I
And so this is goodbye

[Chorus 2]
Give me something to believe in
'Cause I don't believe in you anymore, anymore
I wonder if it even makes a difference
It even makes a difference to try, yeah
And you don't how you're feeling
But I don't believe it's true anymore, anymore
I wonder if it even makes a difference to cry
Oh no, so this is goodbye

[Outro]
 So this is goodbye
 Yeah, so this is goodbye
 Yeah, so this is goodbye

[Intro: LunchMoney Lewis]
Hello, is this thing on? My man
See this one goes out to all the lovers
Lovers' lovers that is
Who spend their nights and days under covers
Girl, the sun could burn out, but you'll still shine
Aw, yeah

[Verse 1: Adam Levine]
No, don't ask me if I love you
'Cause I'm sure as the night is long
And don't ask me if I need you
'Cause I'm sure that the time will come

[Chorus: Adam Levine]
Oh, oh, hey, baby, this is who I am
I shouldn't have to say it for you to understand
'Cause you already got me in the palm of your hand
Just wait a couple lifetimes and ask me again

[Post-Chorus]
Ooh ooh ooh, ay
Ooh ooh ooh, ay
No, I do ooh ooh, ay
Ooh ooh ooh, ay

[Verse 2: Adam Levine]
No don't ask me if I love you
'Cause I'm sure as the day is gone
And don't ask me if I stay true
When you know you're the only one

[Chorus: Adam Levine]
Oh, oh, hey, baby, this is who I am
I shouldn't have to say it for you to understand
'Cause you already got me in the palm of your hand
Just wait a couple lifetimes and ask me again

[Post-Chorus]
Ooh ooh ooh, ay
Ooh ooh ooh, ay
No, I do ooh ooh, ay
Ooh ooh ooh, ay

[Verse 3: LunchMoney Lewis]
Ya
Kiss you, kiss you, kiss you
Hug ya, hug ya, hug ya
Look into your eyes and I see the ocean
I ain't got no wings, but you got me floating on a cloud
Looking down, it's emotion
Champagne flutes, everybody toasting
Heart beat fast on this roller coaster
Love you up and down, spin you 'round and 'round
Can you hear me now?

[Chorus: Adam Levine]
Oh, oh, hey, baby, this is who I am
I shouldn't have to say it for you to understand
'Cause you already got me in the palm of your hand
Just wait a couple lifetimes and ask me again
Oh, oh, hey, baby, this is who I am
I shouldn't have to say it for you to understand
'Cause you already got me in the palm of your hand
Just wait a couple lifetimes and ask me again

[Post-Chorus]
Ooh ooh ooh, ay
Ooh ooh ooh, ay
No, I do ooh ooh, ay
Ooh ooh ooh

[Verse 1]
I asked her to stay, but she wouldn't listen
And she left before I had the chance to say
Oh, oh
Words that would mend the things that were broken
But now it's far too late; she's gone away

[Pre-Chorus]
Every night you cry yourself to sleep
Thinking, "Why does this happen to me?
Why does every moment have to be so hard?"
Hard to believe that

[Chorus]
It's not over tonight
Just give me one more chance to make it right
I may not make it through the night
I won't go home without you

[Verse 2]
The taste of her breath, I'll never get over
The noises that she made, kept me awake
Oh
The weight of things that remained unspoken
Built up so much it crushed us every day

[Pre-Chorus]
Every night you cry yourself to sleep
Thinking, "Why does this happen to me?
Why does every moment have to be so hard?"
Hard to believe that

[Chorus]
It's not over tonight
Just give me one more chance to make it right
I may not make it through the night
I won't go home without you
Oh, oh, oh, oh
It's not over tonight
Just give me one more chance to make it right
I may not make it through the night
I won't go home without you
Oh, oh, oh, oh

[Bridge]
Of all the things I felt but never really showed
Perhaps the worst is that I ever let you go
I should not ever let you go
Oh, oh, oh, oh

[Chorus]
It's not over tonight
Just give me one more chance to make it right
I may not make it through the night
I won't go home without you
Oh, oh, oh, oh
It's not over tonight
Just give me one more chance to make it right
I may not make it through the night
I won't go home without you

[Outro]
And I won't go home without you
And I won't go home without you
I won't go home without you

[Verse 1: Adam Levine]
Dirty looks from your mother
Never seen you in a dress that color, no
It's a special occasion
Not invited, but I'm glad I made it, oh

[Pre-Chorus: Adam Levine]
Let me apologize
I'll make up, make up, make up, make up for all those times
Your love, I don't wanna lose
I'm beggin', beggin', beggin', beggin', I'm beggin' you

[Chorus: Adam Levine]
Wait, can you turn around, can you turn around?
Just wait, can we work this out, can we work this out?
Just wait, can you come here please? 'Cause I wanna be with you
Wait, can you turn around, can you turn around?
Just wait, can we work this out, can we work this out?
Just wait, could you come here please? 'Cause I wanna be with you

[Verse 2: Adam Levine]
Can we talk for a moment?
Got these feelings that I'm tired of holdin' on
Wasn't tryna get wasted
I needed more than three or four to say this, oh

[Pre-Chorus: Adam Levine]
Let me apologize, yeah
I'll make up, make up, make up, make up for all those times 
Your love, I don't wanna lose
I'm beggin', beggin', beggin', beggin', I'm begging you

[Chorus: Adam Levine]
Wait, can you turn around, can you turn around?
Just wait, can we work this out, can we work this out?
Just wait, can you come here please? 'Cause I wanna be with you
Wait, can you turn around, can you turn around?
Just wait, can we work this out, can we work this out?
Just wait, could you come here please? 'Cause I wanna be with you

[Verse 3: A Boogie Wit Da Hoodie]
Wait, can we work this out?
I've been thinkin' out loud all day
Don't let me down
Can't live without my bae
And she wanna leave, but I think it's easier
If you let me be
You should come and see me, girl
Just think about it, girl
You should know I still think about you, yeah
I know you're into diamonds
I can tell you everything defined in you
But I'm like...

[Chorus: Adam Levine]
Wait, can you turn around, can you turn around?
Just wait, can we work this out, can we work this out?
Just wait, can you come here please?
'Cause I wanna be with you
Wait, can you turn around, can you turn around?
Just wait, can we work this out, can we work this out?
Just wait, could you come here please?
'Cause I wanna be with you

[Intro]
I just want the best for you

[Verse 1]
Yeah another night out
I get drunk, I get high
Then you call and I lie
And say I'm on my way now
Yeah, I say I'm on my way now
Show up when it's light out
When you're dressing for work
And I'm mumbling words
I don't know what to say now
No, I don't know what to say now

[Pre-Chorus]
You tell me I don't care, tell me I never try
I said I'm sorry maybe a million times
It's gonna hurt ya if I don't say goodbye
You don't believe me, you don't believe me

[Chorus]
I just want the best for you
I just want the best for you
But I'm just not the best for you
You don't want what I'm gonna put ya through
I just want the best for you
I just want the best for you
But I'm just not the best for you
You don't want what I'm gonna put ya through

[Post-Chorus]
Oh oh no, baby
Oh oh no, baby
Oh oh, baby
You don't want what I'm gonna put ya through

[Verse 2]
Parties with shots and powder
But you'd rather sleep eight hours
And I know you got your doubts
'Cause I can't turn this life around, baby
Thought it was just a phase
'Til I woke up a thousand days later
Realizing I'm the same as I was before I saw your face

[Pre-Chorus]
You tell me I don't care, tell me I never try
I said I'm sorry maybe a million times
It's gonna hurt ya if I don't say goodbye
You don't believe me, you don't believe me

[Chorus]
I just want the best for you
I just want the best for you
But I'm just not the best for you
You don't want what I'm gonna put ya through
I just want the best for you
I just want the best for you
But I'm just not the best for you
You don't want what I'm gonna put ya through

[Post-Chorus]
Oh oh no, baby
Oh oh no, baby
Oh oh, baby
You don't want what I'm gonna put ya through
Oh oh no, baby
Oh oh no, baby
Oh oh, baby
I just want the best for you

[Bridge]
You tell me I don't care, tell me I never try
I said I'm sorry maybe a million times
It's gonna hurt ya if I don't say goodbye
You don't believe me, you don't believe me

[Chorus]
I just want the best for you
I just want the best for you
But I'm just not the best for you 
You don't want what I'm gonna put ya through
I just want the best for you 
I just want the best for you 
But I'm just not the best for you 
You don't want what I'm gonna put ya through

[Post-Chorus]
Oh oh no, baby
Oh oh no, baby
Oh oh, baby
You don't want what I'm gonna put ya through
Oh oh no, baby 
Oh oh no, baby 
Oh oh, baby
I just want the best for you
I just want the best for you

[Verse 1]
I count the ways I let you down
On my fingers and toes, but I'm running out
Clever words can't help me now
I grip you tight, but you're slipping out

[Chorus]
And I remember your eyes were so bright
When I first met you, so in love that night
And now I'm kissing your tears goodnight
And I can't take it, you're even perfect when you cry
Beautiful goodbye 
It's dripping from your eyes 
Your beautiful goodbye 
It's dripping from your eyes 
Oh, yeah

[Verse 2]
When did the rain become a storm?
When did the clouds begin to form?
Yeah, we got knocked off course by a natural force
And we'll, we'll be swimming when it's gone

[Chorus]
And I remember your eyes were so bright
When I first met you, so in love that night
And now I'm kissing your tears goodnight
And I can't take it, you're even perfect when you cry
Beautiful goodbye 
It's dripping from your eyes 
Your beautiful goodbye 
It's dripping from your eyes 
Oh, yeah

[Bridge]
All the pain you try to hide
Shows through your mascara lines
As they stream down from your eyes
And let them go, let them fly
Holding back won't turn back time
Believe me, I've tried

[Chorus]
Your eyes were so bright
And I remember your eyes were so bright
And I remember your eyes were so bright
When I first met you, how in love were we that night?
And now I'm kissing your tears goodnight
And I can't take it, you're even perfect when you cry
Beautiful goodbye 
Oh, yeah
It's dripping from your eyes 
Your beautiful goodbye 
Woah, it's dripping from your eyes 
Yeah, yeah

[Outro]
Oooh
Oh, oh, yeah
Hey, oh

[Verse 1]
Man, it's been a long day
Stuck thinking 'bout it driving on the freeway
Wondering if I really tried everything I could
Not knowing if I should try a little harder

[Hook]
Ooh, but I'm scared to death
That there may not be another one like this
And I confess
That I'm only holding on by a thin, thin thread
I'm kicking the curb, 'cause you never heard
The words that you needed so bad
And I'm kicking the dirt 'cause I never gave you
The things that you needed to have
I'm so sad, sad

[Verse 2]
Man, it's been a long night
Just sitting here trying not to look back
Still looking at the road we never drove on
And wondering if the one I chose was the right one

[Hook]
Ooh, but I'm scared to death
That there may not be another one like this
And I confess
That I'm only holding on by a thin, thin thread
I'm kicking the curb, 'cause you never heard
The words that you needed so bad
And I'm kicking the dirt 'cause I never gave you
The things that you needed to have
I'm so sad, sad

[Bridge]
So sad, so sad

[Hook]
Ooh, but I'm scared to death
That there may not be another one like this
And I confess
That I'm only holding on by a thin, thin thread
I'm kicking the curb, 'cause you never heard
The words that you needed so bad
And I'm kicking the dirt 'cause I never gave you
The things that you needed to have
And I'm kicking the curb, 'cause you never heard
The words that you needed so bad
I'm so sad, so sad

[Verse 1]
You come over to tell me that it's over
Say you wanna do this face to face
Bottle opens, we pour out our emotions
Knew that if you came here, you would stay

[Chorus]
If you want closure, come on and close that door
I know, know, know what'cha really came for
If you want closure, come on and close that door
I know, know, know what'cha really came for
I know what'cha want, baby, what'cha came here for
Closure
I know what'cha want, baby, what'cha came here for
Closure

[Verse 2]
How did we end up in this situation?
Guess it went exactly as you planned
I always give in to your manipulation
I tried to resist, but I just can't

[Chorus]
If you want closure, come on and close that door
I know, know, know what'cha really came for
If you want closure, come on and close that door
I know, know, know what'cha really came for
I know what'cha want, baby, what'cha came here for
Closure
I know what'cha want, baby, what'cha came here for
Closure

[Bridge]
Oh, as soon as we make love
It's gonna break your heart again
'Cause we both know when we wake up
That we'll go back to war again, yeah

[Chorus]
If you want closure, come on and close that door
I know, know, know what'cha really came for
If you want closure, come on and close that door
I know, know, know what'cha really came for
I know what'cha want, baby, what'cha came here for
Closure
I know what'cha want, baby, what'cha came here for
Closure
Oh, yeah, oh

[Instrumental]

[Chorus: Adam Levine]
Baby, I'm preying on you tonight
Hunt you down, eat you alive
Just like animals, animals, like animals-mals
Maybe you think that you can hide
I can smell your scent from miles
Just like animals, animals, like animals-mals
Baby, I'm...

[Verse 1: Adam Levine]
So what you trying to do to me
It's like we can't stop, we're enemies
But we get along when I'm inside you
You're like a drug that's killing me
I cut you out entirely
But I get so high when I'm inside you

[Pre-Chorus: Adam Levine]
Yeah, you can start over, you can run free
You can find other fish in the sea
You can pretend it's meant to be
But you can't stay away from me
I can still hear you making that sound
Taking me down, rolling on the ground
You can pretend that it was me, but no, oh

[Chorus: Adam Levine]
Baby, I'm preying on you tonight
Hunt you down, eat you alive
Just like animals, animals, like animals-mals
Maybe you think that you can hide
I can smell your scent from miles
Just like animals, animals, like animals-mals
Baby, I'm...

[Verse 2: Adam Levine]
So if I run, it's not enough
You're still in my head, forever stuck
So you can do what you wanna do
I love your lies, I'll eat 'em up
But don't deny the animal
That comes alive when I'm inside you

[Pre-Chorus: Adam Levine]
Yeah, you can start over, you can run free
You can find other fish in the sea
You can pretend it's meant to be
But you can't stay away from me
I can still hear you making that sound
Taking me down, rolling on the ground
You can pretend that it was me, but no, oh

[Chorus: Adam Levine]
Baby, I'm preying on you tonight
Hunt you down, eat you alive
Just like animals, animals, like animals-mals
Maybe you think that you can hide
I can smell your scent from miles
Just like animals, animals, like animals-mals
Baby, I'm...

[Bridge: Adam Levine]
Don't tell no lies, you can't deny
The beast inside
No girl don't lie, you can't deny
The beast inside
Just like animals
Just like animals

[Verse 3: J. Cole]
This is pain, this is love, this is sent from above
This a gift from the Gods, this was meant to be
You can run, you can hide, you can front, you can lie
But in time you gon' find you was meant for me
You a part of me and I'm a part of you
I'm addicted, one hit won't do I need a lot of you
Overdosing, your potion has got me floating on cloud nine
Tell me what I'm supposed to do when I run out of you, I'm through
I need a fix like d-boys need bricks
And plus whips to transport 'em
J. Cole, I seen it tall, you can't short 'em
One more time together
I hope your new man don't mind, girl you're mine forever

[Chorus: Adam Levine]
Baby, I'm preying on you tonight
Hunt you down, eat you alive
Just like animals, animals, like animals-mals
Maybe you think that you can hide
I can smell your scent from miles
Just like animals, animals, like animals-mals
Baby, I'm...

[Outro: Adam Levine]
Don't tell no lies, you can't deny
The beast inside
No girl don't lie, you can't deny
The beast inside
Just like animals
Just like animals

[Verse 1]
If you respect me, don't protect me
You can tell me; I can handle it
Stop pretending, 'cause we're going down
If you let go, then just let go
It's disrespectful how you've handled this
Never ending, kinda run around

[Pre-Chorus]
I lied to my heart, 'cause I thought you felt it
You can't light a fire if the candle's melted
No, you don't have to love me if you don't wanna
Don't act like I mean nothing, but if you're gonna
Well, then you better

[Chorus]
Un-kiss me, un-touch me, un-take this heart
And I'm missing just one thing: a brand new start

[Verse 2]
Can't erase this, can't delete this
I don't need this, I can't handle it
I just feel it that you're over us
Oh, if I wait here, if I see you
It won't matter, what's the point of this?
We're in pieces, because you're over us, oh

[Pre-Chorus]
I lied to my heart, 'cause I thought you felt it
You can't light a fire if the candle's melted
No, you don't have to love me if you don't wanna
Don't act like I mean nothing, but if you're gonna
Well, then you better

[Chorus]
Un-kiss me, un-touch me, un-take this heart
And I'm missing just one thing: a brand new start

[Post-Chorus]
So, un-kiss me
So, un-kiss me
Yeah, yeah

[Bridge]
So, baby, let go, gotta let go
It's disrespectful, I can't handle this
Never ending, kinda run around
Yeah, yeah

[Chorus]
Un-kiss me 
Un-touch me 
Un-take this heart
Oh-oh-oh-oh, I'm missing 
Just one thing
A brand new start 

[Post-Chorus]
So, un-kiss me 
So, un-kiss me 
Un-kiss me

[Verse 1]
You're such a motivator, I gotta get you here
So sick of saying yes sir, yes sir
You're such an instigator, you wanna play the game
Take it or leave it, that's her, that's her
And I can't wait another minute
I can't take the look she's giving
Your body rocking, keep me up all night
One in a million, my lucky strike

[Hook]
Got me so high and then she dropped me
But she got me, she got me, she got me bad
Took me inside and then she rocked me
She keep me up all night, this is what it sounds like
 My lucky strike
 My lucky strike
 Your body rocking, keep me up all night
 One in a million, my lucky strike

[Verse 2]
Stuck in her elevator, she take me to the sky
And I don't wanna go down, go down
She said I'll feel you later, go ahead and fantasise
She'll make me want her right now right now
And I can't wait another minute
I can't take the look she's giving
Your body rocking, keep me up all night
One in a million, my lucky strike

[Hook]
Got me so high and then she dropped me
But she got me, she got me, she got me bad
Took me inside and then she rocked me
She keep me up all night, this is what it sounds like
 My lucky strike
 My lucky strike
 Your body rocking, keep me up all night
 One in a million, my lucky strike

[Bridge]
Hey, you're taking all my pain away
You're shaking like an earthquake
Hey, you're taking all my pain away
You're shaking like an earthquake

[Hook]
Got me so high and then she dropped me
But she got me, she got me, she got me bad
Took me inside and then she rocked me
She keep me up all night, this is what it sounds like
 My lucky strike
 My lucky strike
 Your body rocking, keep me up all night
 One in a million, my lucky strike

[Outro]
My lucky strike, my lucky strike
 Your body rocking, keep me up all night
 One in a million

[Verse 1]
I didn't hear what you were sayin'
I live on raw emotion, baby
I answer questions, never maybe
And I'm not kind if you betray me
So who the hell are you to say we
Never would have made it, babe?

[Pre-Chorus]
If you needed love, well, then ask for love
Could have given love, now Im taking love
And its not my fault 'cause you both deserve
What's coming now, so dont say a word

[Chorus]
Wake up call
Caught you in the morning with another one in my bed
Don't you care about me anymore?
Dont you care about me? I don't think so
Six foot tall
Came without a warning, so I had to shoot him dead
He won't come around here anymore
Come around here? I don't think so

[Verse 2]
Would have bled to make you happy
You didn't need to treat me that way
And now you beat me at my own game
And now I find you sleeping soundly
And your lovers screaming loudly
Hear a sound and hit the ground

[Pre-Chorus]
If you needed love, well, then ask for love
Could have given love, now Im taking love
And its not my fault 'cause you both deserve
What's coming now so dont say a word

[Chorus]
Wake up call
Caught you in the morning with another one in my bed
Don't you care about me anymore?
Dont you care about me? I don't think so
Six foot tall
Came without a warning, so I had to shoot him dead
He won't come around here anymore
Come around here? I don't feel so bad
I don't feel so bad
I don't feel so bad

[Bridge]
I'm so sorry, darling
Did I do the wrong thing?
Oh, what was I thinking?
Is his heart still beating?

[Chorus]
Wake up call
Caught you in the morning with another one in my bed
Don't you care about me anymore?
Dont you care about me? I don't think so
Six foot tall
Came without a warning, so I had to shoot him dead
He won't come around here anymore
Come around here? I don't feel so bad
Wake up call
Caught you in the morning with another one in my bed
Don't you care about me anymore?
Dont you care about me? I don't think so
Six foot tall
Came without a warning, so I had to shoot him dead
He won't come around here anymore
No, he won't come around here, I don't feel so bad

[Outro]
I dont feel so bad 
I dont feel so bad 
I dont feel so bad 
Dont you care about me? I dont feel so bad
Wake up call
Caught you in the morning with another one in my bed
Don't you care about me anymore?

[Verse 1: Adam Levine]
I know you're scared, ooh, I can feel it
It's in the air, I know you feel that too
But take a chance on me, you won't regret it, no
One more 'no' and I'll believe you
I'll walk away and I will leave you be
And that's the last time you'll say no, say no to me

[Pre-Chorus: Gwen Stefani & Adam Levine]
It won't take me long to find another lover, but I want you
I can't spend another minute getting over loving you

[Chorus: Adam Levine & Gwen Stefani]
You don't ever say, yeah
Let me hear you say, yeah
Wanna hear you say, yeah
Cause my heart is open
Now you gotta say, yeah
Let me hear you say, yeah
Wanna hear you say, yeah
Wanna hear you say
Wanna hear you say
Wanna hear you say
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes

[Verse 2: Gwen Stefani & Adam Levine]
It's just a moment, go and seize it
Don't be afraid to give your heart to me
And if you do, I know that I won't let you down, no
Yeah, so hand it over, trust me with your love
I'll do anything you want me to
'Cause I can't breathe until I see your face

[Pre-Chorus: Gwen Stefani & Adam Levine]
Ooh, and I don't need time to find another lover, but I want you
I can't spend another minute getting over loving you

[Chorus: Adam Levine & Gwen Stefani]
You don't ever say, yeah
Let me hear you say, yeah
Wanna hear you say, yeah
Cause my heart is open
Now you gotta say, yeah
Let me hear you say, yeah
Wanna hear you say, yeah
Wanna hear you say
Wanna hear you say
Wanna hear you say
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes

[Verse 1]
Woke up sweating from a dream
With a different kind of feeling
All day long my heart was beating
Searching for the meaning

[Pre-Chorus]
Hazel eyes, I was so colorblind
We were just wasting time, oh oh
For my whole life, we never crossed the line
Only friends in my mind, but now I realize

[Chorus]
It was always you
Can't believe I could not see it all this time, all this time
It was always you
Now I know why my heart wasn't satisfied, satisfied
It was always you, you
No more guessing who
Looking back now, I know it was always you, always you

[Verse 2]
All my hidden desires
Finally came alive, oh
No, I never told a lie
To you, so why would I start tonight?

[Pre-Chorus]
Hazel eyes, I was so colorblind
We were just wasting time, oh oh
For my whole life, we never crossed the line
Only friends in my mind, but now I realize

[Chorus]
It was always you
Can't believe I could not see it all this time, all this time
It was always you
Now I know why my heart wasn't satisfied, satisfied
It was always you, you
No more guessing who
Looking back now, I know it was always you, always you

[Bridge]
Woke up sweating from a dream
With a different kind of feeling

[Chorus]
It was always you
Can't believe I could not see it all this time, all this time
It was always you
Now I know why my heart wasn't satisfied, satisfied
It was always you, you
No more guessing who
Looking back now, I know it was always you, always you

[Verse 1]
It's not time for conversation, no
I don't wanna complicate this for you
And I leave them other girls alone
If you'll be the one that I come home to

[Pre-Chorus]
All of my love, all of my love
My time, my attention, my patience, I'm giving it all
All the above, all the above
No, this ain't the way that I usually play this, no no

[Chorus]
Would I lose if I bet my heart on you?
Would I lose if I bet my heart on you?
I don't wanna slow down, won't you let me know now?
Would I lose, oh, if I bet my heart on you?

[Verse 2]
Is it real, is it fake?
Would you leave, would you stay?
Will the night turn into day?
Will we get closer? Or will it be over?
I'm only hoping I don't waste, I don't waste

[Pre-Chorus]
All of my love, all of my love
My time, my attention, my patience, I'm giving it all
All the above, all the above
No, this ain't the way that I usually play this, no no

[Chorus]
Would I lose if I bet my heart on you?
Would I lose if I bet my heart on you?
I don't wanna slow down, won't you let me know now?
Would I lose, oh, if I bet my heart on you?
If I bet my heart on you?

[Bridge]
It's not time for conversation, no
I don't wanna complicate this for you
And I leave them other girls alone
If you'll be the one that I come home to

[Chorus]
Would I lose if I bet my heart on you?
Would I lose if I bet my heart on you?
I don't wanna slow down, won't you let me know now?
Would I lose, oh
Would I lose if I bet my heart on you?
Would I lose if I bet my heart on you?
I don't wanna slow down, won't you let me know now?
Would I lose, oh, if I bet my heart on you?
If I bet my heart on you?
If I bet my heart on you?

[Verse 1]
You're standing there with your cigarette
Looking at me like we've never met
I know I fucked up, so I'll take the blame
And I don't expect you, to let me explain
You can't forgive, I can't forget
I know you're just too different now

[Chorus]
But I miss you and that denim jacket
I let you get away, I let you get away
Do you still wear that denim jacket?
I let you get away, I let you get away
'Cause the color of that blue sky
Just reminds me of our goodbye
Do you still wear the denim jacket?
I let you get away, I let you get away

[Verse 2]
Now someone else is taking you home, yeah
Hands on the waist, I used to hold
And I know it's my fault
I'm late to the dance
'Cause you couldn't wait for me and I understand
Why you never look back, once that door closed
I know you're just too different now

[Chorus]
But I miss you and that denim jacket
I let you get away, I let you get away
Do you still wear that denim jacket?
I let you get away, I let you get away
'Cause the color of that blue sky
Just reminds me of our goodbye
Do you still wear the denim jacket?
I let you get away, I let you get away

[Pre-Chorus]
Do you, do you still?
Do you, do you still?
Do you, do you still
Do you still, do you still
Wear that denim jacket?
Do you, do you still?
Do you, do you still?
Do you, do you still
Do you still, do you still
Wear that denim jacket?

[Bridge]
You're standing there with your cigarette 
Looking at me like we've never met

[Chorus]
But I miss you and that denim jacket
I let you get away, I let you get away
Do you still wear that denim jacket?
I let you get away, I let you get away
'Cause the color of that blue sky
Just reminds me of our goodbye
Do you still wear the denim jacket?
I let you get away, I let you get away

[Outro]
Do you, do you still?
Do you, do you still?
Do you wear that denim jacket?

[Verse 1]
Party girls don't get hurt
Can't feel anything, when will I learn?
I push it down, push it down
I'm the one "for a good time call"
Phone's blowin' up, ringin' my doorbell
I feel the love, feel the love

[Pre-Chorus]
1 2 3, 1 2 3, drink
1 2 3, 1 2 3, drink
1 2 3, 1 2 3, drink
Throw 'em back till I lose count

[Chorus]
I'm gonna swing from the chandelier
From the chandelier
I'm gonna live like tomorrow doesn't exist
Like it doesn't exist
I'm gonna fly like a bird through the night
Feel my tears as they dry
I'm gonna swing from the chandelier
From the chandelier

[Post-Chorus]
But I'm holding on for dear life
Won't look down, won't open my eyes
Keep my glass full until morning light
'Cause I'm just holding on for tonight
Help me, I'm holding on for dear life
Won't look down, won't open my eyes
Keep my glass full until morning light
'Cause I'm just holding on for tonight
On for tonight

[Verse 2]
Sun is up, I'm a mess
Gotta get out now, gotta run from this
Here comes the shame, here comes the shame

[Pre-Chorus]
1 2 3, 1 2 3, drink
1 2 3, 1 2 3, drink
1 2 3, 1 2 3, drink
Throw 'em back till I lose count

[Chorus]
I'm gonna swing from the chandelier
From the chandelier
I'm gonna live like tomorrow doesn't exist
Like it doesn't exist
I'm gonna fly like a bird through the night
Feel my tears as they dry
I'm gonna swing from the chandelier
From the chandelier

[Post-Chorus]
But I'm holding on for dear life
Won't look down, won't open my eyes
Keep my glass full until morning light
'Cause I'm just holding on for tonight
Help me, I'm holding on for dear life
Won't look down, won't open my eyes
Keep my glass full until morning light
'Cause I'm just holding on for tonight
On for tonight

[Outro]
On for tonight
'Cause I'm just holding on for tonight
Oh, I'm just holding on for tonight
On for tonight, on for tonight
'Cause I'm just holding on for tonight

Oh, I'm just holding on for tonight
On for tonight, on for tonight

Ayy, I am the truth
Ayy, I am the wisdom of the fallen; I'm the youth
Ayy, I am the greatest
Ayy, this is the proof
Ayy, I work hard, pray hard, pay dues, ayy
I transform with pressure, I'm hands-on with effort
I fell twice before, my bounce back was special
Letdowns'll get you, and the critics'll test you
But the strong'll survive, another scar may bless you, ah

Don't give up , I won't give up 
Don't give up, no no no 
Don't give up, I won't give up

[Verse 1]
I'm trying but I keep falling down
I cry out but nothing comes now
I'm giving my all and I know peace will come
I never wanted to need someone

[Pre-Chorus]
Yeah, I wanted to play tough
Thought I could do all just on my own
But even Superwoman
Sometimes needed Superman's soul

[Chorus]
Help me out of this hell
Your love lifts me up like helium
Your love lifts me up when I'm down, down, down
When I've hit the ground
You're all I need

[Verse 2]
And if you let go I'll float towards the sun
I'm stronger 'cause you fill me up
But when the fear comes and I drift towards the ground
I am lucky that you're around

[Pre-Chorus]
Yeah, I wanted to play tough
Thought I could do all just on my own
But even Superwoman
Sometimes needed Superman's soul

[Chorus]
Help me out of this hell
Your love lifts me up like helium
Your love lifts me up when I'm down, down, down
When I've hit the ground
You're all I need
'Cause your love lifts me up like helium
Your love lifts me up like helium

[Bridge]
You lift me up and I am found
You lift me up before I hit the ground
You lift me up when I'm down, down, down
You lift me up before I hit the ground
You lift me up and I am found
You lift me up before I hit the ground
You lift me up when I'm down, down, down
You lift me up before I hit the ground!

[Chorus]
Your love lifts me up like helium
Your love lifts me up when I'm down, down, down
When I've hit the ground
You're all I need
'Cause your love lifts me up like helium
Your love lifts me up like helium
Your love lifts me up like helium
Your love lifts me up like helium

I won't give up, I won't give up

[Verse 1: Sia]
And another one bites the dust
Oh, why can I not conquer love?
And I might have thought that we were one
Wanted to fight this war without weapons
And I wanted it, I wanted it bad
But there were so many red flags
Now another one bites the dust
Yeah, let's be clear, I'll trust no one

[Pre-Chorus: Sia]
You did not break me
I'm still fighting for peace

[Chorus: Sia]
I've got a thick skin and an elastic heart
But your blade it might be too sharp
I'm like a rubber band until you pull too hard
Yeah I may snap and I move fast
But you won't see me fall apart
'Cause I've got an elastic heart

[Post-Chorus: Sia]
I've got an elastic heart
Yeah, I've got an elastic heart

[Verse 2: The Weeknd]
And I will stay up through the night
Let's be clear, won't close my eyes
And I know that I can survive
I'll walk through fire to save my life
And I want it, I want my life so bad
I'm doing everything I can
Then another one bites the dust
It's hard to lose a chosen one

You did not break me 
I'm still fighting for peace

[Verse 1]
Clipped wings, I was a broken thing
Had a voice, had a voice but I could not sing
You'd worn me down
I struggled on the ground
So lost, the line had been crossed
Had a voice, had a voice but I could not talk
You held me down
I struggle to fly now

[Pre-Chorus]
But there's a scream inside that we all try to hide
We hold on so tight, but we cannot deny
Eats us alive, it eats us alive
Yes, there's a scream inside that we all try to hide
We hold on so tight, but I don't wanna die, no
I don't wanna die, I don't wanna die

[Chorus]
And I don't care if I sing off key
I found myself in my melodies
I sing for love, I sing for me
I shout it out like a bird set free
No, I don't care if I sing off key
I found myself in my melodies
I sing for love, I sing for me
I'll shout it out like a bird set free

[Post-Chorus]
I'll shout it out like a bird set free
I'll shout it out like a bird set free

Now I fly, hit the high notes
I have a voice, have a voice, hear me roar tonight
You held me down but I fought back loud

[Pre-Chorus]
And there's a scream inside that we all try to hide
We hold on so tight, but we cannot deny
Eats us alive, it eats us alive
Yes, there's a scream inside that we all try to hide
We hold on so tight, but I don't wanna die, no
I don't wanna die, I don't wanna die yeah

[Chorus]
And I don't care if I sing off key
I found myself in my melodies
I sing for love, I sing for me

[Verse 1]
Don't cry, snowman, not in front of me
Who'll catch your tears if you can't catch me, darling
If you can't catch me, darling
Don't cry snowman, don't leave me this way
A puddle of water can't hold me close, baby
Can't hold me close, baby

[Chorus]
I want you to know that I'm never leaving
Cause I'm Mrs. Snow, 'til death we'll be freezing
Yeah you are my home, my home for all seasons
So come on let's go

I love you forever where we'll have some fun
Yes, let's hit the North Pole and live happily
Please don't cry no tears now
It's Christmas, baby

My snowman and me
My snowman and me
Baby

[Verse 2]
Don't cry, snowman, don't you fear the sun
Who'll carry me without legs to run, honey

Don't cry, snowman, don't you shed a tear
Who'll hear my secrets if you don't have ears, baby
If you don't have ears, baby

[Chorus]
I want you to know that I'm never leaving
Cause I'm Mrs. Snow, 'til death we'll be freezing

My snowman and me
My snowman and me
Baby

[Verse 1]
I was born in a thunderstorm
I grew up overnight
I played alone, I played on my own
I survived
I wanted everything I never had
Like the love that comes with light
I wore envy and I hated that
But I survived

[Pre-Chorus]
I had a one-way ticket to a place where all the demons go
Where the wind don't change
And nothing in the ground can ever grow
No hope, just lies
And you're taught to cry into your pillow
But I survived

[Chorus]
I'm still breathing, I'm still breathing
I'm still breathing, I'm still breathing
I'm alive, I'm alive
I'm alive, I'm alive

[Verse 2]
I found solace in the strangest place
Way in the back of my mind
I saw my life in a stranger's face
And it was mine

[Pre-Chorus]
I had a one-way ticket to a place where all the demons go
Where the wind don't change
And nothing in the ground can ever grow
No hope, just lies
And you're taught to cry into your pillow
But I survived

[Chorus]
I'm still breathing, I'm still breathing
I'm still breathing, I'm still breathing
I'm alive, I'm alive
I'm alive, I'm alive

[Post-Chorus]
You took it all, but I'm still breathing
You took it all, but I'm still breathing
You took it all, but I'm still breathing
You took it all, but I'm still breathing
You took it all, but I'm still breathing
You took it all, but I'm still breathing
You took it all, but I'm still breathing
You took it all, but I'm still breathing

[Bridge]
I have made every single mistake
That you could ever possibly make
I took and I took and I took what you gave
But you never noticed that I was in pain
I knew what I wanted; I went out and got it
I did all the things that you said that I wouldn't
I told you that I would never be forgotten
And all in spite of you

[Chorus]
And I'm still breathing, I'm still breathing
I'm still breathing, I'm still breathing
I'm alive 

I'm alive 

I'm alive 

I'm alive

[Outro]
I'm alive, I'm alive
I'm alive, I'm alive

[Verse 1]
Help, I have done it again
I have been here many times before
Hurt myself again today
And, the worst part is there's no-one else to blame

[Chorus]
Be my friend, hold me
Wrap me up, enfold me
I am small and needy
Warm me up and breathe me

[Verse 2]
Ouch I have lost myself again
Lost myself and I am nowhere to be found
Yeah I think that I might break
Lost myself again and I feel unsafe

[Chorus]
Be my friend, hold me
Wrap me up, enfold me
I am small and needy
Warm me up and breathe me
Be my friend, hold me
Wrap me up, enfold me
I am small and needy
Warm me up and breathe me

[Verse 1]
Broke down, thought that I would drown
Hope that I've been found, 'fore I hit the ground
Some days out the corner of my eye, hey
Saw you weeping, saw you creeping
Saw you sneaking in the shadow's long
The fear so strong
Saw you out the corner of my eye

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't come for me today
I'm feeling good
I'mma savor it
Don't come for me today
I'm feeling good
I remember when


[Chorus]
You came to take me away
So close I was to heaven's gates
But no baby, no baby, not today
Oh, you tried to track me down
You followed me like the darkest cloud
But no baby, no baby, not today
 Oh reaper
 Oh no baby, no baby, not today
 Oh reaper
 Oh no baby, no baby, not today

[Verse 2]
So come back when I'm good and old
I got drinks to drink, and men to hold
I got good things to do with my life, yeah
Oh, I wanna dance in the open breeze
Feel the wind in my hair, hear the ocean sing
I got good things to feel in my life, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't come for me today
I'm feeling good
I'mma savor it
Don't come for me today
I'm feeling good
I remember when


[Chorus]
You came to take me away
So close I was to heaven's gates
But no baby, no baby, not today
Oh, you tried to track me down

 Oh reaper
 Oh no baby, no baby, not today

[Verse 1]
I'll smile, I know what it takes to fool this town
I'll do it 'til the sun goes down and all through the night time
I'll tell you what you wanna hear
Keep my sunglasses on while I shed a tear
It's never the right time

[Pre-Chorus]
I put my armor on, show you how strong I am
I put my armor on, I'll show you that I am

[Chorus]
I'm unstoppable, I'm a Porsche with no brakes
I'm invincible, I win every single game
I'm so powerful, I don't need batteries to play
I'm so confident, I'm unstoppable today
Unstoppable today, unstoppable today
Unstoppable today, I'm unstoppable today

[Verse 2]
I break down, only alone I will cry out loud
Youll never see whats hiding out
Hiding out deep down
I know, Ive heard that to let your feelings show
Is the only way to make friendships grow
But Im too afraid now

[Pre-Chorus]
I put my armor on, show you how strong I am
I put my armor on, I'll show you that I am

[Chorus]
I'm unstoppable, I'm a Porsche with no brakes
I'm invincible, I win every single game
I'm so powerful, I don't need batteries to play

Unstoppable today, I'm unstoppable today
Unstoppable today, unstoppable today
Unstoppable today, I'm unstoppable today

[Verse 1]
Tough girl in the fast lane
No time for love, no time for hate
No drama, no time for games
Tough girl whose soul aches

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm at home, on my own
Check my phone, nothing, though
Act busy, order in
Pay TV, it's agony
Oh

[Chorus]
I may cry ruinin' my makeup
Wash away all the things you've taken
And I don't care if I don't look pretty
Big girls cry when their hearts are breaking
Big girls cry when their hearts are breaking
Big girls cry when their heart is breaking

[Verse 2]
Tough girl, I'm in pain
It's lonely at the top, blackouts and airplanes
And I still pour you a glass, of champagne
Tough girl whose soul aches

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm at home, on my own
Check my phone, nothing, though
Act busy, order in
Pay TV, it's agony
Oh

[Chorus]
I may cry ruining my makeup
Wash away all the things you've taken
And I don't care if I don't look pretty
Big girls cry when their hearts are breaking
Big girls cry when their hearts are breaking
Big girls cry when their hearts are breaking

[Bridge]
I wake up
I wake up
I wake up
I wake up
I wake up
I wake up
I wake up
I wake up
I wake up
I wake up
I wake up
I wake up
I wake up
Alone

[Chorus]
I may cry ruinin' my makeup
Wash away all the things you've taken
And I don't care if I don't look pretty
Big girls cry when their hearts are breaking
Big girls cry when their hearts are breaking
Big girls cry when their heart is breaking

[Verse 1]
I'm fighting a battle
I'm fighting my shadow
Herd fears like they're cattle
I'm fighting a battle, yeah
I'm fighting my ego
Lost youth, where did we go wrong?
I'm fighting for me, though
I'm lighting the long way home

[Chorus]
Oh the past, it haunted me
Oh the past, it wanted me dead
Oh the past tormented me
Oh the past, it wanted me dead
Oh the past, it haunted me
Oh the past, it wanted me dead
Oh the past tormented me
But the battle was lost
'Cause I'm still here

[Verse 2]
I'm winning the war now
I'm winning it all now
Watch tears while they fall down
I'm winning the war now
I win against ego
Cast light on the shadow's long
I'm winning for me, though
I'm lighting the long way home

[Chorus]
Oh the past, it haunted me
Oh the past, it wanted me dead
Oh the past tormented me
Oh the past, it wanted me dead
Oh the past, it haunted me
Oh the past, it wanted me dead
Oh the past tormented me
But the battle was lost
'Cause I'm still here

It's haunted me
Oh the past, it wanted me dead
Oh the past, it's haunted me
Oh the past, it wanted me dead
Oh the past, it's haunted me
Oh the past, it wanted me dead
Oh the past tormented me
But the battle was lost
'Cause I'm still here

[Bridge]
I'm fighting my ego
Lost youth, where did we go wrong?
I'm winning for me, though
I'm lighting the long way home

[Chorus]
Oh the past, it's haunted me
Oh the past, it wanted me dead
Oh the past tormented me
Oh the past, it wanted me dead
Oh the past, it's haunted me
Oh the past, it wanted me dead
Oh the past tormented me
But the battle was lost
'Cause I'm still here

It's haunted me
Oh the past, it wanted me dead
Oh the past, it's haunted me
Oh the past, it wanted me dead
Oh the past, it's haunted me
Oh the past, it wanted me dead
Oh the past tormented me
But the battle was lost
'Cause I'm still here[Snippet]

[Verse]
Have you told me all?
I've got things to say
Hey, I'm talking to ya
We got things to do
We got plans to make
And I wanna take you with me
Yeah, I wanna take you with me

[Pre-Chorus]
But a far-off gaze is wide in me
Can you feel it?
And if you can't tell I'm a restless girl
What are you hearing?

[Chorus]
Pack it all away, pack it all in one suitcase
I got all I need, all I need to be free
Pack it all away, pack it all in one suitcase
I got all I need, all I need to be free
Pack it all away, pack it all in one suitcase
I got all I need, all I need, I'm flying
Pack it all away, pack it all in one suitcase
I got all I need, all I need to be free
Pack it all away, pack it all in one suitcase
I got all I need, all I need, I'm flying

[Verse 1]
Poetry in your body, you got it in every way
And can't you see it's you I'm watching?
I am hot for you in every way
And turn around, let me see you, wanna free you with my rhythm
I know you can't get enough when I turn up with my rhythm

[Chorus]
Your bodys poetry, speak to me
Wont you let me be your rhythm tonight?

I wanna be your muse, use my music and let me be your rhythm tonight

Your bodys poetry speak to me
Wont you let me be your rhythm tonight?

I wanna be your muse, use my music and let me be your rhythm tonight


[Verse 2]
Poetry in your body got me started, may it never end
Feel my rhythm in your system, this is living, I'm your only friend
Feel the beat in your chest, beat your chest like an animal
Free the beast from its cage, free the rage like an animal

[Chorus]
Your bodys poetry, speak to me
Wont you let me be your rhythm tonight?

I wanna be your muse, use my music and let me be your rhythm tonight

Your bodys poetry speak to me

[Verse 1]
I know you, youre a special one
Some see crazy where I see love
You fall so low but shoot so high
Big dreamers shoot for open sky
So much life in those open eyes
So much depth, you look for the light
But when your wounds open, you will cry
Youll cry out now and youll question why

[Chorus]
I can see a rainbow
In your tears as they fall on down
I can see your soul grow
Through the pain as they hit the ground
I can see a rainbow
In your tears as the sun comes out
As the sun comes out

[Verse 2]
I am here and I see your pain
Through the storms, through the clouds, the rain
Im telling you you cannot escape
You can do it, just feel baby

[Chorus]
I can see a rainbow
In your tears as they fall on down
I can see your soul grow
Through the pain as they hit the ground
I can see a rainbow
In your tears as the sun comes out
As the sun comes out

[Bridge]
Here comes the sun
Smiling down
Here comes the sun
Smiling down
Here comes the sun
Smiling down
Smiling down

[Chorus]
I can see a rainbow
In your tears as they fall on down
I can see your soul grow
Through the pain as they hit the ground
I can see a rainbow
In your tears as the sun comes out
As the sun comes out
I can see a rainbow
In your tears as they fall on down
I can see your soul grow
Through the pain as they hit the ground
I can see a rainbow
In your tears as the sun comes out
As the sun comes out

[Intro: Sia]
A toast to the groom!

To the bride!

From your sister

Who is always by your side

To your union and the hope that you provide

May you always 
Be satisfied 

Rewind!
Rewind!
I remember that night, I just might
I remember that night, I just might
I remember that night, I remember that

[Verse 1]
I remember that night, I just might
Regret that night for the rest of my days
I remember those soldier boys
Tripping over themselves to win our praise
I remember that dreamlike candlelight
Like a dream that you cant quite place
But Alexander, Ill never forget the first
Time I saw your face
I have never been the same
Intelligent eyes in a hunger-pang frame
And when you said Hi,
I forgot my dang name
Set my heart aflame, evry part aflame
This is not a game

[Interlude: Miguel & Sia]
You strike me as a woman who has never been satisfied
Im sure I dont know what you mean, you forget yourself
Youre like me, Ive never been satisfied
Is that right?
I have never been satisfied
My name's Angelica Schuyler
Alexander Hamilton
Wheres your famly from?
Unimportant, theres a million things I havent done
Just you wait, just you wait...

[Rap Break: Queen Latifah]
So so so
So this is what it feels like to match wits
With someone at your level! What the hell is the catch? Its
The feeling of freedom, of seein the light
Its Ben Franklin with a key and a kite! You see it, right?
The conversation lasted two minutes, maybe three minutes
Evrything we said in total agreement, its
A dream and its a bit of a dance
A bit of a posture, its a bit of a stance
Hes a bit of a flirt, but Im a give him a chance
I asked about his famly, did you see his answer?
His hands started fidgeting, he looked askance
Hes penniless, hes flying by the seat of his pants

[Bridge: Queen Latifah]
Handsome, boy, does he know it!
Peach fuzz, and he cant even grow it!
I wanna take him far away from this place
Then I turn and see my sisters face and she is

[Sia]
Helpless
And I know she is
Helpless
And her eyes are just
Helpless
And I realize three fundamental truths at the exact same time

[Verse 2]
Im a girl in a world in which
My only job is to marry rich
My father has no sons so Im the one
Who has to social climb for one
Cause Im the oldest and the wittiest and the gossip in
New York City is insidious
And Alexander is penniless
Ha! That doesnt mean I want him any less





Hes after me 'cause Im a Schuyler sister
And that elevates his status, Id
Have to be nave to set that aside
Maybe that is why I introduce him to Eliza
Now thats his bride
Nice going, Angelica, he was right
You will never be satisfied




[Bridge]
I know my sister like I know my own mind
You will never find anyone as trusting or as kind
If I tell her that I love him shed be silently resigned
Hed be mine
She would say, Im fine
But shed be lying

But when I fantasize at night
Its Alexanders eyes
As I romanticize what might have been
If I hadnt sized him up so quickly
At least my dear Elizas his wife
At least I keep his eyes in my life

[Outro: Sia]
To the groom!

To the bride!

From your sister

Who is always by your side

To your union and the hope that you provide


May you always
Be satisfied
And I know 
Shell be happy as his bride
And I know
He will never be satisfied
I will never be satisfied

[Verse 1: Sia]
Under rich, relentless skies
I've been setting highs
I felt you walk right through me
You're the thing that I invoke
My old, persistent ghost
Sent to make me queazy

[Pre-Chorus: Labrinth]
And oh, it's hard now
With time, it works out

[Chorus: Sia & Labrinth]
To be human is to love
Even when it gets too much
I'm not ready to give up
To be human is to love
Even when it gets too much
I'm not ready to give up

[Verse 2: Sia]
All the tigers have been out
I don't care, I hear them howl
I let them tear right through me
Can you help me not to care?
Every breath becomes a prayer
Take this pain from me

[Pre-Chorus: Labrinth]
And oh, you're so far now
So far from my arms now

[Chorus: Sia & Labrinth]
To be human is to love
Even when it gets too much
I'm not ready to give up
To be human is to love
Even when it gets too much
I'm not ready to give up
To be human
To be human
To be human

[Bridge: Sia & Labrinth]
Just 'cause I predicted this
Doesn't make it any easier to live with
And what's the point of knowin' it
If you can't change it? You can't change, can't change it
Just 'cause I predicted this
Doesn't make it any easier to live with
And what's the point of knowin' it
If you can't change it? You can't change, can't change it

[Chorus: Sia & Labrinth]
To be human is to love
Even when it gets too much
I'm not ready to give up
To be human is to love
Even when it gets too much
There's no reason to give up

[Outro: Sia]
Don't give up

[Verse 1]
It's dangerous to fall in love, but I
Wanna burn with you tonight
Hurt me
There's two of us, we're certain with desire
The pleasure's pain and fire
Burn me

[Pre-Chorus]
So come on
I'll take you on
Take you on
I ache for love, ache for us
Why don't you come, don't you come a little closer?
So come on now
Strike the match
Strike the match now
A perfect match
Perfect, somehow
We were meant for one another
Come a little closer

[Chorus]
Flame you came to me, fire meet gasoline
Fire meet gasoline, I'm burnin' alive
I can barely breathe, when you're here loving me
Fire meet gasoline, fire meet gasoline
I got all I need, when you came after me
Fire meet gasoline, I'm burnin' alive
I can barely breathe, when you're here loving me
Fire meet gasoline, fire meet gasoline
Fire meet gasoline burn with me tonight

[Verse 2]
And we will fly
Like smoke darkenin' the skies
I'm Eve, I wanna try
Take a bite

[Pre-Chorus Variation]
So come on now
Strike the match
Strike the match now
We're a perfect match
Perfect, somehow
We were meant for one another
Come a little closer

[Chorus]
Flame you came to me, fire meet gasoline
Fire meet gasoline, I'm burnin' alive
I can barely breathe, when you're here loving me
Fire meet gasoline, fire meet gasoline
I got all I need, when you came back to me
Fire meet gasoline, I'm burnin' alive
And I can barely breathe, when you're here loving me
Fire meet gasoline, burn with me tonight

[Bridge]
But it's a bad bet
Certain death
But I want what I want
And I got to get it
When the fire dies
Darkened skies
Hot ash, dead match
Only smoke is left
But it's a bad bet
Certain death
But I want what I want
And I got to get it
When the fire dies
Darkened the skies
Hot ash, dead match
Only smoke is left

[Chorus]
Flame you came to me, fire meet gasoline
Fire meet gasoline, I'm burnin' alive
I can barely breathe, when you're here loving me
Fire meet gasoline, fire meet gasoline
I got all I need, when you came back to me
Fire meet gasoline, I'm burnin' alive
And I can barely breathe, when you're here loving me
Fire meet gasoline, burn with me tonight

[Outro]
Burn with me tonight
Burn with me tonight
Burn with me tonight
Eh eh

[Verse 1]
Nights are getting shorter now
Hot chocolate fills the air and Christmas cheer does too
Picking out your Christmas tree, so lovely
The joy this time it brings to you

[Refrain]



Santa's coming to town



Santa's coming to town

[Pre-Chorus]
Sing it to the deer in the sky
Sing it as they jingle, jingle, jingle tonight
Sing it to the moon, set it free
You're the angel on the top of my tree
Sing it to the spirit above
Sing your heart out with all of your love
Santa's coming for us

[Chorus]
Santa's coming for us
Santa's coming for us
Santa's coming for us

[Verse 1]
Lay down your arms
I don't wanna fight anymore
Rough seas will be calm
Hold on while we weather the storm

[Pre-Chorus]
We fall down like dogs playing dead
But our loves not worth playing chicken with

[Chorus]
I'm not discarding you like broken glass
There are no winners when the die is cast
There's only tears when it's the final dance
So don't give up, it's just young lovers' romance
So don't give up, it's just young lovers' romance

[Verse 2]
This too shall pass
We're right where we're meant to be
There's things I don't ask
What I don't know can't hurt me

[Pre-Chorus]
We fall down like dogs playing dead
But our love's not worth playing chicken with

[Chorus]
I am not discarding you like broken glass
There are no winners when the die is cast
No, there's only tears when it's the final dance
So don't give up, it's just young lovers' romance
So don't give up, it's just young lovers' romance
So don't give up, it's just young lovers' romance
So don't give up, it's just young lovers' romance
I'm not discarding you like broken glass
There are no winners when the die is cast
There's only tears when it's the final dance
So don't give up, it's just young lovers' romance
I'm not discarding you like broken glass
There are no winners when the die is cast
There's only tears when it's the final dance
So don't give up, it's just young lovers' romance
Don't give up, it's just young lovers' romance
Don't give up, it's just young lovers' romance

[Outro]
Oh, I'm not discarding you like broken glass
I'm not discarding you like broken glass
I'm not discarding you like broken glass
So dont give up its just young lovers' romance

[Verse 1]
I've battled demons that won't let me sleep
Called to the sea but she abandoned me

But I won't never give up, no, never give up, no, no

Your heart burns through, I feel the pain and I cry out

Baby I'm a house on fire

[Verse 1]
We had love so strong my heart couldn't take it
You took it in your hands and resuscitated
You said, me and you against the world
You said, you and me forever girl
I felt every cell fall in love with you, but

[Pre-Chorus]
I watched you slip, slip away, no explanation
You on your phone, your laptop and your PlayStation
I stared at the diamond on my finger and I waited
But the truth never came, but I know her name, so see you later

[Chorus]
No I won't miss you, I won't cry, I don't regret it
No I won't stand for it, no I don't need confetti
And you can treat another to your lies, you'll never get it
I'd rather walk alone than let them throw dirty confetti
I'd rather walk alone, I'd rather walk alone
I'd rather walk alone than let them throw dirty confetti

[Verse 2]
You hurt my pride, part of me died, but all of that's ego
And the house we lived in had no doors, and it had no windows
You said, "I'm hangin' with the boys"
You said "Workin' late to pay our bills"
But I found lipstick on your collar, wasn't my color

[Pre-Chorus]
I watched you slip, slip away, no explanation
You on your phone, your laptop and your Playstation
I stared at the diamond on my finger and I waited
But the truth never came, but I know her name, so see you later

[Chorus]
No I won't miss you, I won't cry, I don't regret it
No I won't stand for it, no I don't need confetti
And you can treat another to your lies, you'll never get it
I'd rather walk alone than let them throw dirty confetti
I'd rather walk alone than let them throw dirty confetti
No I won't miss you, I won't cry, I don't regret it
No I won't stand for it, no I don't need confetti
And you can treat another to your lies, you'll never get it
I'd rather walk alone than let them throw dirty confetti
I'd rather walk alone than let them throw dirty confetti
I'd rather walk alone, I'd rather walk alone
I'd rather walk alone than let them throw dirty confetti

[Outro]
I'd rather walk alone, I'd rather walk alone
I'd rather walk alone than let them throw dirty confetti
I'd rather walk alone, I'd rather walk alone
I'd rather walk alone than let them throw dirty confettiFeeling good on a Wednesday
The image of me that you see
Is distorted, twisted, broken, fractured
Isolated miles out to sea

I don't want a separate place
I need to feel safe not thrown away away away away

And I will push  to tear down the walls

Of this box you put me in

Because you don't understand
Push ow hot, push ow hot
And though you push

To find a label that fits me
I'm feeling good on a Wednesday with the sparkling thoughts

Help me unload the car ya ya ya
And so I push to close the door
Of the stall you've made for me to keep me away
And now we push, push to stand together
Because I am Lorde
Ya Ya Ya
Ya Ya Ya I am Lorde
I am Lorde Ya Ya Ya
Ya Ya Ya I am Lorde
Ya Ya Ya Ya Ya Ya
I am Lorde
Ya Ya Ya

[Verse 1]
Take me down
I'm feeling now
And if I move on
I admit you're gone

[Pre-Chorus]
And I ain't ready
But I'll hold steady
Yeah I'll hold you
In my arms, in my arms
In my arms, whoa

[Chorus]
You're locked inside my heart, whoa
Your melody's an art, whoa
I won't let the terror in, I'm stealing time
Through the eye of the needle

[Verse 2]
Step and repeat
Tears fall to the beat
Smile through the pain
Feel the acid rain

[Pre-Chorus]
And I ain't ready
But I'll hold steady
Yeah I'll hold you
In my arms, in my arms
In my arms, whoa

[Chorus]
And you're locked inside my heart, whoa
And your melody's an art, whoa
I won't let the terror in, I'm stealing time
Through the eye of the needle

[Bridge]
My bags' heavy
Been filled by me
They weigh me down
Carry them round
It's all mine, all mine
Oh I am blinded by the eye of the needle

[Chorus]
You're locked inside my heart, whoa
Your melody's an art, whoa
And I won't let the terror in, I'm stealing time
Through the eye of the needle, eye of the needle
You're locked inside my heart, whoa
And your melody's an art, whoa
And I won't let the terror in, I'm stealing time
Through the eye of the needle

[Verse 1]

[Verse 1]
I had given up
I didn't know who to trust
So I designed a shell
Kept me from heaven and hell
Ohh oh oh
And I had hit a low
Was all I let myself know
Yeah I had locked my heart
I was imprisoned by dark


[Chorus]
You found me dressed in black
Hiding way up at the back
Life had broken my heart into pieces
You took my hand in yours
You started breaking down my walls
And you covered my heart in kisses
I thought life passed me by
Missed my tears, ignored my cries
Life had broken my heart, my spirit
And then you crossed my path
You quelled my fears, you made me laugh
Then you covered my heart in kisses

[Verse 2]
I was down for the count
I was down I was out
And I had lost it all
Yes I was scared, I was torn
And I took to the night
I'd given in to the fight
And I slipped further down
I felt like I had drowned

[Chorus]
You found me dressed in black
Hiding way up at the back
Life had broken my heart into pieces
You took my hand in yours
You started breaking down my walls
And you covered my heart in kisses
I thought life passed me by
Missed my tears, ignored my cries
Life had broken my heart, my spirit
And then you crossed my path
You quelled my fears, you made me laugh
Then you covered my heart in kisses

[Bridge]
I was hopeless and broken
You opened the door for me
Yeah I was hiding and you let the light in
And now I see
That you do for the wounded
What they couldn't seem to
You set them free
Like a butterfly kissing a child with an eye for the minor key
Yeah yeah

[Chorus]
You found me dressed in black
Hiding way up at the back
Life had broken my heart into pieces
You took my hand in yours
You started breaking down my walls
And you covered my heart in kisses
I thought life passed me by
Missed my tears, ignored my cries
Life had broken my heart, my spirit
And then you crossed my path
You quelled my fears, you made me laugh
Then you covered my heart in kisses

[Interlude]
Oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh

[Outro]
You covered my heart in kisses

[Verse 1]
All the leaves are brown and the sky is gray
I've been for a walk on a winter's day
I'd be safe and warm if I was in L.A.
California dreamin', oh, on such a winter's day
All the leaves are brown and the sky is gray
I've been for a walk on a winter's day
I'd be safe and warm if I was in L.A.
Oh, California dreamin', on such a winter's day

[Verse 2]
I stopped into a church I passed along the way
Well, I got down on my knees
And I pretended to pray
You know the preacher likes the cold
He knows I'm gonna stay
California dreamin', oh, oh, on such a winter's day

[Breakdown]
I'd be safe and warm
I'd be safe and warm
I'd be safe and warm
I'd be safe and warm

[Outro]
All the leaves are brown 
And the sky is gray 
I've been for a walk, oh, on a winter's day
If I didn't go, I could leave today
California dreamin', on such a winter's day
Oh, on such a winter's day
On such a winter's day

[Verse 1]
I'd fallen through the floor again, crashed into the basement
The pain was swallowing me
I was like a lead balloon, I couldn't even get up to turn the lights on
The dark is swallowing

[Pre-Chorus]
Lord knows you cant trust your head
When you're standing on the edge of breaking down
Lord knows you cant trust your head
When you're hanging by a thread
I was breaking down, and I saw

[Chorus]
Only two footprints in the sand
Thought you'd abandoned me and let go of my hand
But you were carrying me, carrying me to safety
Two footprints, your footprints in the sand
Two footprints, two footprints, your footprints in the sand
Two footprints, your footprints in the sand

[Verse 2]
I forgot the things I knew, it was I who'd abandoned you
Forgive me, I was lost in doubt
You had never left my side, picked me up when I thought I would die
You held me and I was found

[Pre-Chorus]
Lord knows you cant trust your head
When you're standing on the edge of breaking down
Lord knows you cant trust your head
When you're hanging by a thread
And I'm breaking down

[Chorus]
Only two footprints in the sand
Thought you'd abandoned me and let go of my hand
But you were carrying me, carrying me to safety
Two footprints, your footprints in the sand
Only two footprints in the sand
Thought you'd abandoned me and let go of my hand
But you were carrying me, carrying me to safety
Two footprints, your footprints in the sand
Two footprints, two footprints, your footprints in the sand
Two footprints, your footprints in the sand

[Verse 1]
Under the moonlight within your warm embrace
I feel so safe here, baby, you were worth the wait
I picked the wrong kind time after time
I drank from the poisoned wine
I picked the wrong kind, but baby, you're alright
Baby, I seen the light

[Pre-Chorus]
I got a feeling, I got a feeling
Danger is coming, a danger is coming
A danger is coming
I got a feeling, I got a feeling
The war has been won here, the war has been won here

[Chorus]
Under the moonlight, under your moonlit gaze
I know that I'd take one million bullets, babe
One million bullets could come my way
But I want you to know that, I'd take a million, babe

[Post-Chorus]
How many would you take?
How many would you take?
How many would you take?
How many would you take?
Cause I'd take one million bullets, babe

[Verse 2]
If you were a poet and I was a faultless muse
If you were the hero, I'd take a bullet for you
So take me in your arms, take me for all I have
Cause I'd give my life for one of your belly laughs

[Pre-Chorus]
I got a feeling, I got a feeling
Danger is coming, a danger is coming
A danger is coming
I got a feeling, I got a feeling
The war has been won here, the war has been won here

[Chorus]
Under the moonlight, under your moonlit gaze
I know that I'd take one million bullets, babe
One million bullets should come my way
But I want you to know that, I'd take a million, babe

[Outro]
How many would you take?
How many wouldyou take?
How many would you take?
How many would you take?
Cause I'd take one million bullets, babe

[Verse 1]
Oh so, your wounds they show
I know you have never felt so alone
But hold on, head up, be strong
Oh hold on, hold on until you hear them come
Here they come, oh

[Chorus]
Take an angel by the wings
Beg her now for anything
Beg her now for one more day
Take an angel by the wings
Time to tell her everything
Ask her for the strength to stay

Look up, call to the sky
Oh, look up and don't ask why, oh

[Chorus]
Just take an angel by the wings
Beg her now for anything
Beg her now for one more day
Take an angel by the wings
Time to tell her everything
Ask her for the strength to stay

[Verse 1]
You say you are fine
But I see pain
Behind those eyes
You play the game
By the rigid rules
But you cheat yourself

[Pre-Chorus]
There ain't nothing you can say
That would scare me away
I got history too
And it's never too late
Share a secret today
I reciprocrate
Baby, I got you

[Chorus]
So hurt with me
I'll hurt with you
Baby, you know we can hurt together
I've been where you've been
I've seen what you've seen
So hurt with me
We can hurt together
Come, hurt with me
Come, hurt with me
Come, hurt with me
Come, hurt with me

[Verse 2]
Someday you'll taste
The freedom and relieve
Of a trouble shared
Oh, oh
Today I'm here loving you
Confide in me

[Pre-Chorus]
There ain't nothing you can say
That would scare me away
I got history too
And it's never too late
Share a secret today
I reciprocate
Baby, I got you

[Chorus]
So hurt with me
I'll hurt with you
Baby, you know we can hurt together
I've been where you've been 
I've seen what you've seen 
So hurt with me 
We can hurt together
Come, hurt with me
Come, hurt with me
Come, hurt with me
Come, hurt with me

[Verse 1]
Take a trip down Candy Cane Lane with me

It's the best, so get dressed, I'll impress

Ain't no can't's, 'cause here, everything is possible

[Verse 1]
My love, leave yourself behind
Beat inside me, leave you blind
My love, you have found peace
You were searching for relief

[Pre-Chorus]
You gave it all
Gave into the call
You took a chance and
You took a fall for us
You came thoughtfully
Loved me faithfully
You taught me honor
You did it for me

[Chorus]
Today you will sleep away
You will wait for me, my love
Now I am strong 
You gave me all
You gave all you had
And now I am whole

[Verse 2]
My love, leave yourself behind
Beat inside me, leave you blind
My love, look what you can do
I am mending, I'll be with you

[Pre-Chorus]
You took my hand
Added a plan
You gave me your heart
I asked you to dance with me
You loved honestly
Gave what you could release
Ah, oh

[Chorus]
I know in peace you'll go
I hope relief is yours
Now I am strong 
You gave me all
You gave all you had
And now I am whole

[Bridge]
My love
Beat inside me

[Outro]
My love, leave yourself behind
Beat inside me, I'll be with you
Oh, oh
Du-du-du-oh

[Verse 1]
A never ending sentence in my head
We lay hollow in the emptiness
I'm too tired to push you from the bed

[Pre-Chorus]
No more fighting, no more fighting
There's no more fighting for us

[Chorus]
Fill the void in our bed
The space between is deafening
Oh, we don't bend, we're breaking
The space between is deafening
The space between is deafening

[Verse 2]
No one's moving, we lack the courage to
We lay in stalemate, wishing the other would
But we're too tired, we let the embers cool

[Pre-Chorus]
No more fighting, there's no more fighting
There's no more fighting for us

[Chorus]
Fill the void in our bed
The space between is deafening
Oh, we don't bend, we're breaking
The space between is deafening

[Bridge]
No more fighting, we've given up now
Silence says more than words
Imagination cures loneliness
When you become a prisoner

[Chorus]
Fill the void in our bed
The space between is deafening
Oh, we don't bend, we're breaking
The space between is deafening

[Verse 1]
What would I do without your smart mouth?
Drawin' me in and you kickin' me out
You've got my head spinnin', no kiddin'
I can't pin you down
What's goin' on in that beautiful mind?
I'm on your magical mystery ride
And I'm so dizzy, don't know what hit me
But I'll be alright

[Pre-Chorus]
My head's under water, but I'm breathing fine
You're crazy and I'm out of my mind

[Chorus]
'Cause all of me
Loves all of you
Love your curves and all your edges
All your perfect imperfections
Give your all to me
I'll give my all to you
You're my end and my beginnin'
Even when I lose, I'm winnin'

[Post-Chorus]
'Cause I give you all of me
And you give me all of you, oh-oh

[Verse 2]
How many times do I have to tell you?
Even when you're crying, you're beautiful too
The world is beating you down, I'm around
Through every mood
You're my downfall, you're my muse
My worst distraction, my rhythm and blues
I can't stop singing, it's ringing
In my head for you

[Pre-Chorus]
My head's under water, but I'm breathin' fine
You're crazy and I'm out of my mind

[Chorus]
'Cause all of me
Loves all of you
Love your curves and all your edges
All your perfect imperfections
Give your all to me
I'll give my all to you
You're my end and my beginnin'
Even when I lose, I'm winnin'

[Post-Chorus]
'Cause I give you all of me
And you give me all of you, oh-oh

[Bridge]
Give me all of you, oh
Cards on the table, we're both showing hearts
Risking it all, though it's hard

[Chorus]
'Cause all of me
Loves all of you
Love your curves and all your edges
All your perfect imperfections
Give your all to me
I'll give my all to you
You're my end and my beginnin'
Even when I lose, I'm winnin'

[Post-Chorus]
'Cause I give you all of me
And you give me all of you

[Outro]
I give you all of me
And you give me all of you, oh-oh[Produced by Dave Tozer, John Legend & Malay]

I... Yeah

[Verse 1]
You fix your make up, just so
Guess you don't know, that you're beautiful
Try on every dress that you own
You were fine in my eyes, a half hour ago

[Pre hook]
And if your mirror won't make it any clearer I'll
Be the one to let you know

[Hook]
Out of all the girls
You my one and only girl
Ain't nobody in the world tonight

All of the stars, you make them shine like they were ours
Ain't nobody in the world but you and I
You and I
Ain't nobody in the world but you

[Verse 2]
You stop the room when we walk in
Spotlights on everybody staring
Tell all of these boys, they wasting their time
Stop standing in line, cause you're all mine

[Pre hook]
And this evening I, won't let the feeling die
I never wanna leave your side

[Hook]
Out of all the girls
Youre my one and only girl
Ain't nobody in the world tonight
All of the stars, you make them shine like they were ours
Ain't nobody in the world but you and I
You and I
Ain't nobody in the world

[Bridge]
You keep wondering if you're what I'm wanting
You don't even have to try

Ooh, you don't have to try
Don't try
Don't try
You don't have to try

[Hook]
Ooh
Out of all the girls
Youre my one and only girl
Ain't nobody in the world tonight
All of the stars, they don't shine brighter than you are
Ain't nobody in the world but you and I
You and I
You and I
Nobody in the world tonight
Ain't nobody in the world but you and I

[Verse 1]
Pulling me further, further than I've been before
Making me stronger, shaking me right to the core
Oh, I don't know what's in the stars
Never heard it from above, the world isn't ours
But I know what's in my heart, if you ain't mine I'll be torn apart

[Chorus]
I don't know who's gonna kiss you when I'm gone
So I'm gonna love you now, like it's all I have
I know it'll kill me when it's over
I don't wanna think about it, I want you to love me now
I don't know who's gonna kiss you when I'm gone
So I'm gonna love you now, like it's all I have
I know it'll kill me when it's over
I don't wanna think about it, I want you to love me now

[Post-Chorus]
Love me now, love me now
Oh, oh, love me now, oh, oh, oh, yeah
Love me now, love me now
Oh, I want you to love me now

[Verse 2]
Something inside us knows there's nothing guaranteed
Yeah, girl, I don't need you to tell me that you'll never leave, no
When we've done all that we could to turn darkness into light, turn evil to good
Even when we try so hard for that perfect kind of love, it could all fall apart

[Chorus]
And who's gonna kiss you when I'm gone?
Oh I'm gonna love you now, like it's all I have
And I know it'll kill me when it's over
I don't wanna think about it, I want you to love me now

[Post-Chorus]
Love me now, love me now
Oh, love me now, oh, oh, oh
Love me now
Love me now, love me now
Love me now

[Bridge]
Oh I don't know how the years will go down, it's alright
Let's make the most of every moment tonight

[Chorus]
I don't know who's gonna kiss you when I'm gone
So I'm gonna love you now, like it's all I have
I know it'll kill me when it's over
I don't wanna think about it, I want you to love me now
I don't know who's gonna kiss you when I'm gone
So I'm gonna love you now, like it's all I have
I know it'll kill me when it's over
I don't wanna think about it, I just wanna love you now

[Post-Chorus]
Love me now, love me now
Oh, oh, love you now, oh, oh, oh
Love me now, love me now
Love you now
Oh, love you now, oh, oh, oh, oh

[Intro]
Oh, oh, oh, oh

[Verse 1]
Girl, I'm in love with you
But this ain't the honeymoon
We're passed the infatuation phase
We're right in the thick of love
At times we get sick of love
It seems like we argue every day
I know I misbehaved
And you made your mistakes
And we've both still got room left to grow
And though love sometimes hurts
I still put you first
And we'll make this thing work
But I think we should take it slow

[Hook]
We're just ordinary people
We don't know which way to go
'Cause we're ordinary people
Maybe we should take it slow
Take it slow, oh-oh, this time we'll take it slow
Take it slow, oh-oh, this time we'll take it slow

[Verse 2]
This ain't a movie, no
No fairytale conclusion y'all
It gets more confusing every day, oh
Sometimes it's Heaven sent
Then we head back to Hell again
We kiss, then we make up on the way
I hang up, you call
We rise and we fall
And we feel like just walking away
As our love advances
We take second chances
Though it's not a fantasy
I still want you to stay

[Hook]
We're just ordinary people
We don't know which way to go
'Cause we're ordinary people
Maybe we should take it slow
Take it slow, oh-oh, this time we'll take it slow
Take it slow, oh-oh, yeah, this time we'll take it slow
Take it slow

[Verse 3]
Maybe we'll live and learn
Maybe we'll crash and burn
Maybe you'll stay
Maybe you'll leave
Maybe you'll return
Maybe another fight
Maybe we won't survive
Maybe we'll grow
We'll never know
Baby, you and I

[Outro]
We're just ordinary people
We don't know which way to go, yeah, hey
'Cause we're ordinary people
Maybe we should take it slow, hey, hey
We're just ordinary people
We don't know which way to go, yeah
'Cause we're ordinary people
Maybe we should take it slow
Take it slow, oh-oh, this time we'll take it slow
Take it slow, oh-oh, this time we'll take it slow
Take it slow, slow
This time we'll take it slow
Take it slow, oh
This time we'll take it slow[Produced by Dave Tozer, Da Internz, Kanye West & Nana Kwabena]

Oooh, I was never sure of a God before
But I know he must exist
He created this...

[Hook: John Legend]

And I just know Ill feel so good tonight

Ive been thinking bout some things I wanna try
I dont know what you came to do, but I wanna do it with you
And I just know Ill feel so good tonight

Oh, if we keep on dancing

[Chorus]
We could start a fire
Come on, let it burn baby
We could start a fire
Let the tables turn baby

[Intro: Lenny Kravitz]
When was the last time we got to be 100% real, ya'll?
I don't want ya'll holding back nothing!

[John Legend]
Who do we think we are?
Baby, tell me, who do we think we are?

[Verse 1: John Legend]
We made a lot of magic
Its the only way we know
Lets trip the night fantastic
Light it up, tell me more, explore
We love, we love, we love the stars
We could fall so hard
The drinks, the minks, the jewels, the house, the cars
Whyd we ball so hard?

[Hook: John Legend]
Yeah, Im not afraid to fly
Here we are, in the air, barely breathing
And were not afraid to die
Who do we think we are?
Baby, tell me, who do we think we are?
Who do we think we are?
Baby, tell me, who do we think we are?

[Bridge: John Legend]
Weve got a lot of nerve, girl
We walk around here like we own this place

[Verse 2: Rick Ross]
See my jewels dripping on my Timberlands
Stepping like a criminal, success is so imminent
Pink champagne, black Rolls Royce
Eggplant double breasted suit from Tom Ford
Bon voyage, left haters in the fog
Look up in the sky, bet you recognize a boss
Look into my eyes as I fantasize for us
Still actin shy like this is summer class crush
Money comin fast, Im never in a rush, no
Plus another twenty in the tuck
Semi in the truck, another forty on the wrist
Quarter-mill on my mind got me livin like I pitch
Dodging Robin Givens, balling like Im Roger Clemens
Still in the game, uniform all linen
She get Chanel, ski trips to Vail
Only the highest grade, like trees that I inhale

[Hook: John Legend]
Yeah, Im not afraid to fly
Here we are, in the air, barely breathing
And were not afraid to die
Who do we think we are?
Baby, tell me, who do we think we are?
Who do we think we are?
Baby, tell me, who do we think we are?

[Outro: John Legend]
Who do we think we are?
I dont know about yall, but I feel good tonight
Theres something in the air tonight
You know, everyone needs someone to look up to
Why shouldn't it be us?
Who do we think we are?
Tell me, who do we think we are?
Who do we think we are?
Tell me, who do we think we are?

[Lenny Kravitz]
This is our song  our song for the future

[Verse 1: John Legend]
Alright
Ain't this what you came for?
Don't you wish you came more?
Girl, what you playing for?
Ay, come on
Come on let me kiss that
Ooh, I know you miss that
What's wrong? Let me fix that
Twist that

[Hook: John Legend]
Baby, tonight's the night I let you know
Baby, tonight's the night we lose control
Baby, tonight you need that, tonight believe that
Tonight I'll be the best you ever had
I don't wanna brag, but I'll be
The best you ever had
I don't wanna brag, but I'll be
The best you ever had

[Verse 2: John Legend]
I hit you with the best stroke
Freestyle and then the breaststroke
Til you blowing cigarette smoke
And now the bed's broke
So what we gonna do now?
Fuck it, round two now
Work it out, then we cool down
Cool down

[Hook: John Legend]
Baby, tonight's the night I let you know
Baby, tonight's the night we lose control
Baby, tonight you need that, tonight believe that
Tonight I'll be the best you ever had
I don't wanna brag, but I'll be
The best you ever had
I don't wanna brag, but I'll be

The best you ever had

[Verse 3: Ludacris]
Luda! Listen
You ain't even gotta text me
Knowing me and you got that mental telepathy
Me be up at the spot, I'll be sending over the chauffeur
Rich nigga, bread stay popping like a toaster
Nobody come close to me and you together
Step under my umbrella
Well make it through any weather
Except when I make it storm
Sex in the greatest form
And hibernate under my body
Yep, I keep it warmer than a chinchilla
She know I beat it up like the Thrilla in Manila
Flying my private jet to villas in Anguilla
Then throw you on a grill
Cause seven days a week youre my five course meal


[Hook: John Legend]
Baby, tonight's the night I let you know
Baby, tonight's the night we lose control
Baby, tonight you need that, tonight believe that
Tonight I'll be the best you ever had
I don't wanna brag, but I'll be
The best you ever had
I don't wanna brag, but I'll be
The best you ever had
I don't wanna brag, but I'll be
The best you ever had

[Verse 1: John Legend]
I see you move, I'm checking your smile
Workin your back like, it's going out of style

Dying to meet you, so let's mess around
Got an obsession, of us getting down
Come just a little bit closer

[Verse 2: John Legend & ]
Do I have a girlfriend? Well, technically no 
If you be my girlfriend, then I'll make it so
You'll be my only true lover
No competition, no other 
Baby, it's just, the thrill of the chase
I've got a feeling, I'm winning this race
Baby, I'm in much closer
I just need permission so

[Chorus: John Legend]
Give me the green light

[Verse 3: Andr 3000]
So I went hard like Medusa starin at me
I told her, "Let's go, let's blow this lame nigga factory"
She said, "What kind of girl do you think that I are?
The kind that you meet in a bar?
You think you can get whatever you want cause you some kind of star"
No, I'm a comet; I just want you woman
Hey, if I were you then it would be me that I'd go home with
Three, the one and only, one thing you ain't considered
I heard you when you told your girl, "Ooh, he can get it" - admit it
You did it! Let's hop a cab, and split it
I'm kiddin! We both goin' to where you livin'!
Eh-HAH!! I got you giggling like a piglet - oh, that's the ticket?
I hope you more like, Anita Baker, than Robin Givens
No, I don't know that lady, so let me quit it
I'm just stylefreein', freestylin' which I seldom do
This is what I'm tellin' you, to the bed I'm nailin' you
Like I've been in jail for two, years and then they let me loose

[Chorus: John Legend]
Give me the green light
Give me just one night
I'm ready to go right now
I'm ready to go right now
We could go all night
Give me the green light
I'm ready to go right now
I'm ready to go right now

[Overlap: Andr 3000]
You got you one, Legend!
Sometimes you gotta step from behind that piano!
And let 'em know what's going on
Even Stevie Wonder got down sometimes..Hahaha!
I'm ready to go! My mandate can't wait
Participate

[Outro: John Legend]
I'm ready to go right now
I'm ready to go right now
I'm ready to go right now
I'm ready to go right now

[Intro]
Hey

[Verse 1]
I had no intention I would get fucked up tonight
When I looked in your eyes and they went through me like a knife
I came here with my crew, I lost them
Came with my cool, I dropped it
And if I'm being honest, I'm being honest

[Pre-Chorus]
I can't think when you're looking like that
Can't breathe when you're moving like that
Tell me when you're gonna do me like that 
I'm so weak and I'm never like that
Light-speed and I think I might crash
One trip down and I'll never go back

[Chorus]
But everything's gonna be alright
I think I just met my wife 
I know it's gonna be a good night
I think I just met my wife 

[Verse 2]
Maybe it's the music or the red stain on your lips
I wonder when the right time is to go in for a kiss
But I'm thinking past that lover, I'm ready to meet your momma
If I'm being honest, I'm being honest

[Pre-Chorus]
I can't think when you're looking like that
Can't breathe when you're moving like that
Tell me when you're gonna do me like that 
I wish you knew what Im thinking right now
I dont know if I can say it out loud
I dont know if I can say it out loud

[Chorus]
But everything's gonna be alright
I think I just met my wife 
I know it's gonna be a good night
I think I just met my wife 

[Bridge]
Baby, baby, baby
You got me talking crazy
I figure if I say it
You just might be my lady
Baby, it's you, yeah
Baby, it's you, yeah
And oooh, I feel like something good is 'bout to be going on
And baby it's you, yeah
And baby it's you, yeah

[Chorus]
And everything's gonna be alright
I think I just met my wife 
I know it's gonna be a good night
I think I just met my wife 
And everything's gonna be alright
I think I just met my wife 
I know it's gonna be a good night
I think I just met my wife 

[Outro]
Everything's gonna be alright
I think I just met my wife
I know it's gonna be a good night
I think I just met my wife

[Verse 1]
Can you just stay through the night?
Turn down the bed and the blinds
Before you turn around
Can you just stay through the night?
Let me breathe you in 'til gravity bends
And we fall through the hole in the light
Make this our kingdom
Somewhere where good love conquers and not divides

[Chorus]
Cause I may not know a lot of things but
I feel it in my chest
Know I won't let the blue flame die
We can't lose hope just yet
'Cause it's once, just once in a lifetime
And we're scared to love but it's alright
I may not know a lot of things but
I know that we're surefire, yeah
Know that we're surefire, yeah

[Verse 2]
Can't keep this bed warm on the left side
When something is cold as a goodbye
Why don't you turn around?
Ignore all that shit from the outside
The world is a nightmare
Wake up and stay here
Let me be on your side
We'll make this our kingdom
Somewhere where good love conquers and not divides

[Pre-Chorus]
And oh my, oh my, oh my, oh my God
I'm so, I'm so, I'm so tired of fighting
Let go, give in, let go and give up, oh

[Chorus]
I may not know a lot of things but
I feel it in my chest
Know I won't let the blue flame die
We can't lose hope just yet
'Cause it's once, just once in a lifetime
And we're scared to love but it's alright
I may not know a lot of things but
I know that we're surefire
Know that we're surefire

[Pre-Chorus]
And oh my, oh my, oh my, oh my God
I'm so, I'm so, I'm so tired of fighting
Let go, give in, let go and give up, oh

[Chorus]
I may not know a lot of things but
I feel it in my chest
If we just let the blue flame die
The devil wins this bet
Oh it's once, just once in a lifetime
And you're scared to love but it's alright
I may not know a lot of things but
I know that we're surefire
Know that we're surefire

[Verse 1: Kelly Clarkson & John Legend]
I really can't stay 
I've got to go away 
Thisevening has been 
So very nice 
My momma will start to worry 
My daddy will be pacing the floor 
So, really, I'd better scurry 
But maybe just a half a drink more 
What will my friends think? 
If I have one more drink? 
Ooh, you really know how 
To cast a spell 
I ought to say, "No, no, no, sir" 
At least I'm gonna say that I tried 

[Chorus: Kelly Clarkson, John Legend & Both]
Oh, I really can't stay

Baby, it's cold outside

[Verse 2: Kelly Clarkson & John Legend]
I simply should go 
Oh, I'm supposed to say no 
This welcome has been 
So nice and warm 
My sister will be suspicious 
My brother will be there at the door 
My gossipy neighbor is vicious 
But maybe just a cigarette more 
I've got to get home 
Say, lend me a coat 
You've really been grand 
But don't you see? 
There's bound to be talk tomorrow 
At least there will be plenty implied 
Uh, ma'am, I really can't stay

[Chorus: Kelly Clarkson & Both]
Baby, just go
It's cold, baby
It's cold, baby
But, ooh, I don't wanna go
It's cold outside

[Verse 1]
Talk, let's have conversations in the dark
World is sleeping, I'm awake with you, with you
Watchmoviesthat we've bothalready seen
I ain't even looking atthe screen
It's true, I got my eyes on you

[Pre-Chorus]
And you say that you're not worth it
You get hung up on your flaws
Well, in my eyes, you are perfect as you are

[Chorus]
I won't ever try to change you, change you
I will always want the same you, same you
Swear on everything I pray to
That I won't break your heart
I'll be there when you get lonely, lonely
Keep the secrets that you told me, told me
And your love is all you owe me
And I won't break your heart

[Verse 2]
On Sunday mornings we sleep in 'til noon
Oh, I could sleep wherever next to you, next to you
And we, we got places we both gotta be
But there ain't nothing I would rather do
Than blow off all my plans for you

[Pre-Chorus]
And you say that you're not worth it
And get hung up on your flaws
But in my eyes, you are perfect as you are
As you are

[Chorus]
I won't ever try to change you, change you
I will always want the same you, same you
Swear on everything I pray to
That I won't break your heart
I'll be there when you get lonely, lonely
Keep the secrets that you told me, told me
And your love is all you owe me
And I won't break your heart

[Bridge]
When no one seems to notice
And your days, they seem so hard
My darling, you should know this
My love is everywhere you are

[Chorus]
I won't ever try to change you, change you 
I will always want the same you, same you 
Swear on everything I pray to
That I won't break your heart 
I'll be there when you get lonely, lonely 
Keep the secrets that you told me, told me 
And your love is all you owe me
And I won't break your heart

[Outro]
Ooh
Ooh
I won't break your heart

[Verse 1: John Legend]
Yeah we used to flirt with freedom
'Fore everybody knew our name
We became their favorite secret
Love for love and not for fame
Oh when I was your user your FaceTime abuser
Dose after dose 'til we crashed
Now they bet on our game, say we'll go down in flames
It's too good but we never could last

[Chorus: John Legend  & Miguel]
But oh, we was undercover 'til it overflowed, over exposed
But oh, chained our love together, never took it slow
And now we know, life on overload, love, love...
Don't we always make a show of love , love, love, love, yeah...

[Verse 2: Miguel]
Let that cellphone ring, let that bluebird sing, let that message say unread
Let them talk about us, let them talk too much
While we rule the whole world from our bed

[Chorus: Miguel  & John Legend]
'Cause oh, we was undercover 'til it overflowed, over exposed
Oh, chained our life together, never took it slow
And now we know, life on overload
Don't we always make a show of love
Life on overload, must we make a spectacle of love?

[Bridge: John Legend]
Oh yeah, yeah

[Chorus: John Legend & Miguel]
'Cause oh, we was undercover 'til it overflowed, over exposed
Oh, chained our love together, never took it slow
And now we know, life on overload
Don't we always make a show of love
Life on overload, must we make a spectacle of love?[Produced by Dave Tozer, Hit Boy & Kanye West]

[Verse 1]
Last night was the last night
You'll ever spend alone
Couldnt wait, did it in the living room
Soon as I saw you, baby, I had plans
Plans to do it 'til we have a baby
Even if the world is crazy
Pick some names, boy or girl
Then well change, change the world

[Hook]
So after you change your clothes
Girl, if you change your mind
Im ready, whatever time
Its the beginning of forever
You dont have to call
Sometimes you just know
Its the beginning of forever
You dont have to end
Keep doing it, and doing it again, oh
Keep doing it, and doing it again, oh

[Verse 2]
Last time was the last time, I was worn and done
You the best, that's why I want another one
Soon as I saw you, baby I had plans
Plans to take you to my elevator
And cook a little breakfast later
Pick a place and go there, girl
Then well change, change the world

[Hook]
[Hook]
So after you change your clothes
Girl, if you change your mind
Im ready, whatever time
Its the beginning of forever
You dont have to call
Sometimes you just know
Its the beginning of forever
You dont have to end
Keep doing it, and doing it again, oh
Keep doing it, and doing it again, oh[Produced by Boogz N Tapes, Darhyl Camper, Dave Tozer & Kanye West]

[Verse 1]
I see you in the lonely place
How can you be so blind
You still regretting the love you left, left behind
Oh darling, I seen you go through the changes
Sitting alone each night
Are you expecting to find the love, love that's right

[Hook]
Darling open your eyes
Let me show you light
Girl you never find a love that's right
Darling open your eyes
Let me show you the light
Girl you think you're so wise, you're so wise

[Verse 2]
There are times when you need someone
I will be by your side
I'll take my chances before they pass, pass me by
Oh darling, there is a light that shines
Special for you and me
You need to look at the other side, you'll agree

[Outro]
Darling open your eyes
Let me show you light
Girl you never find a love that's right
Darling open your eyes
Let me show you light
You may never find a love that's right
Darling open your eyes
Let me show you light
You may never find a love that's right
Darling open your eyes
Let me show you the light
Girl you think you're so wise
You may never find a love that's rightI get up every evening
And I ain't got nothing to say
Come on in the morning
I go to bed feeling the same way
I am nothing but tired
Mand I'm just tired and bored of myself
Hey there baby
I could use just a little love
You can't start a fire
Can't start a fire without a spark
This gun's for fire
Even if we are just dancing in the dark
Messages keep getting clearer
Radio's on and I'm moving around the place
I check my look in the mirror
Want to change my clothes, my hair, my face

Man, I ain't getting nowhere
Just living in a dump like this
There's something happening somewhere
Baby, I just know there is

You can't start a fire
You can't start a fire without a spark
This gun's for hire
Even if we're just dancing in the dark

You sit around getting older
There's a joke here somewhere and it's on me
I'll shake this world off my shoulders
Come on, baby, the laugh's on me

Stay on the streets of this town
And they'll be carving you up, all right
They say you gotta stay hungry
Hey baby, I'm just about starving tonight

I'm dying for some action
I'm sick of sitting around here, trying to write this book
I need a love reaction
Come on, baby, give me just one look

You can't start a fire
Sitting around crying over a broken heart
This gun's for hire
Even if we're just dancing in the dark

You can't start a fire
Worrying about your little world falling apart
This gun's for hire
Even if we're just dancing in the dark

Even if we're just dancing in the dark
Even if we're just dancing in the dark
Even if we're just dancing in the dark
Hey baby!

[Verse 1]
Now I'm not afraid to do the Lord's work
You said vengeance is His, but I'ma do it first
I'm gon' handle my business in the name of the law 
Now if he made you cry, oh, I gotta know
If he's not ready to die, he best prepare for it
My judgement's divine, I'll tell you who you can call
You can call

[Chorus 1]
You better call the police, call the coroner
Call up your priest, have him warn ya
Won't be no peace when I find that fool
Who did that to you, yeah
Who did that to you, my baby
Who did that to you
Gotta find that fool who did that to you

[Verse 2]
Now I don't take pleasure in a man's pain
But my wrath will come down like the cold rain
And there won't be no shelter, no place you can go
It's time to put your hands up, time for surrender
I'm a vigilante, my love's defender
You're a wanted man, here everybody knows

[Chorus 1]
You better call the police, call the coroner
Call up your priest, have him warn ya
Won't be no peace when I find that fool
Who did that to you, yeah
Who did that to you, my baby
Who did that to you
Gotta find that fool who did that to you

[Bridge]
Now he'll keep on running, but I'm closing in
I hunt him down until the bitter end
If you see me coming man, who're you gonna call?

[Chorus 2]
You better call the police, call the coroner
Call up your priest, have him warn ya
Won't be no peace when I find that fool
You better call the doctor, call the lawyer
I chased him all away to California
Did my best trying to find that fool
Who did that to you

[Verse 1: John Legend]
All this trouble in this here town
All this shit going down
When will they focus, on this?
Streets ride up with the TV crews
Look ma, we on the news
But they didn't notice, before this
They float above the city lights
Forget the truth, inhale the lies
Just enjoy the show
They see us reaching for the sky
Just ignore that you survive

[Chorus: John Legend]
Maybe we should go
Go to the penthouse floor 
Go to the penthouse floor 
Let's ride the elevator, they can't keep us out no more
Go to the penthouse floor 
Penthouse floor

[Verse 2: John Legend]
All that bubbly, all that wine
Oh man, look at the times
Didn't they notice, notice?
Only future I can see, ain't what it used to be
And I didn't know this, I didn't know this
Once you're above the city lights
Won't want to spend another night, down there on your own
The whole world on display for us
The altitude is dangerous, but we ain't going home

[Chorus: John Legend]
Go to the penthouse floor 
Go to the penthouse floor 
Let's ride the elevator, it's what we've been waiting for
Can't keep us out no more 
Penthouse floor

[Verse 3: Chance The Rapper]
I heard this old joke once, it was like, uh
Knock knock, who there, it's us, us who?
Just us, who dis? Just playin'
Just me, new phone, new hair, new era
I'm in the penthouse, baby
Handpicked from bad apples and bad eggs
Held back, I had to grab crab legs
And then there were only but a few
Conversations held with patience, what a party, what a view
What a dress, what a song
What a beautiful time
My folks downstairs still waitin' in line
They never been in these rooms
Never stayed with these folks
Never laughed at the news, never hated these jokes
So as I fly in my suit, in a group, undercover
Forcin' a new smile, he tells me another
He said "What happened to the boy that climbed up the trunk?"
Then he pushed me off the top and said "Jump, nigga, jump!"

[Bridge: John Legend]
Oh dont bring me down I need a room up in the clouds
I wanna get there babe, I wanna elevate
Oh my favorite mix, a little ignorance and bliss
In the penthouse babe, go to the penthouse

[Chorus: John Legend]
Go to the penthouse floor 
Go to the penthouse floor 
Let's ride the elevator, it's what we've been waiting for
We'll tear down those penthouse doors 
Those penthouse doors
We'll tear down the penthouse doors 
Baby, I'm in the penthouse floor
Baby, let's ride the elevator
Til we can rise some more
Go to the penthouse floor, penthouse floor [Hook X2]
Roll Jordan roll
Roll Jordan roll
I want to get to heaven when I die
To hear Jordan roll

[Verse 1]
My brother, you ought to been there
Yes, my Lord
A sitting in the kingdom
To see o Jordan roll

[Hook]
Roll Jordan roll
Roll Jordan roll
I want to get to heaven when I die
To hear Jordan roll

[Verse 2]
My mother, you ought to been there
Yes, my Lord
A sitting in the kingdom
To see o Jordan roll

[Hook]
Roll Jordan roll
Roll Jordan roll
I want to get to heaven when I die
To hear Jordan roll
I want to get to heaven when I die
To see o Jordan roll

[Verse 1]
I always believed that love was surrender
And I wouldn't go down without a fight
I always left room for other contenders
'Cause I might change my mind

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Damn, I used to be so cold
Would never ever get too close
Didn't ever wanna lose control
But from the moment that I tasted
I knew that I would have to chase it
You said hold up, I want you to be

[Chorus]
A one woman man
A one woman man, oh
Want you all to myself
Don't want nobody else
All your loving
All or nothing
Won't you be
A one woman man 
A one woman man, oh 

[Verse 2]
You made me believe that love was forever
And love could sustain us through every fight
I let go of all of the other pretenders
They were wasting my time

[Pre-Chorus 2]
I never thought that I would say this
But I can see us having babies
I could see it from the start
That I might give you my heart
From the moment that I met you
Knew that I would never let you
Slip away, it's okay
You can make me

[Chorus]
A one woman man
A one woman man, oh
I want you all to myself
Don't want nobody else
All my loving
All or nothing
I can be
A one woman man 
A one woman man, uh 

[Bridge]
I could never say I loved you
I kept up my guard
But you broke in my house
You've stolen my heart
Now I've given you the key
Got all of you for all of me
But baby, I promise to be

[Chorus]
A one - woman man, oh
I want you all to myself
Don't want nobody else
All my loving
All or nothing
I can be
A one woman man 
A one woman man, uh [Produced by The Runners & Co]

[Verse 1]
A little trouble in the city
Trouble in my home
She told me love don't live here anymore
I wanna run to the light
It's too dark in this part of night
I need somebody who can make it right

[Hook]
And it's on tonight
How about we go and save the night
I can see you want it and so do I
How about we go and save the night
Let's save the night

[Verse 2]
I'm not a one man band
I want to sing a duet
You and me would sound much better
You look so good in my bed
And if your gonna go out
Your gonna go out with a bang
Let's save the night i'll be your superman

[Hook]
And it's on tonight
How about we go and save the night
I can see you want it and so do I
How about we go and save the night
Let's save the night

[Bridge]
I see the night flashing before her eyes
Resuscitating bring it back to life

[Hook]
And it's on tonight
How about we go and save the night
I can see you want it and so do I
How about we go and save the night
Let's save the night

[Verse 1]
Say that you'll stay a little
Dont say bye-bye tonight
Say you'll be mine
Just a little bit of love
Is worth a moment of your time
Knockin' on your door just a little
It's so cold outside tonight
Let's get a fire burning
Oh I know I'll keep it burning bright
If you stay, won't you save, save

[Hook]
Save room for my love
Save room for a moment to be with me
Save room for my love
Save a little, save a little for me
Won't you save a little
Save a little for me? 

[Verse 2]
This just might hurt a little
Love hurts sometimes when you do it right
Dont be afraid of a little bit of pain
Pleasure is on the other side
Let down your guard just a little
I'll keep you safe in these arms of mine
Hold on to me, pretty baby
You will see, I can be all you need
If you stay, won't you save, save

[Hook]
Save room for my love
Save room for a moment to be with me
Save room for my love
Save a little, save a little for me
Won't you save a little
Save a little for me? 

[Verse 3]
Oh c'mon
Make time to live a little
Don't let this moment slip by tonight
You'll never know what you're missing
'till you try, I'll keep you satisfied if you stay
Won't you save, save

[Hook] x2
Save room for my love
Save room for a moment to be with me
Save room for my love
Save a little, save a little for me
Won't you save a little
Save a little for me 
(Won't you save a little
Save a little for me?)

[Verse 1]
Every day I wake and everything is broken
Turnin' off my phone just to get out of bed
Get home every evenin' and history's repeatin'
Turnin' off my phone 'cause it's hurtin' my chest
Hey

[Pre-Chorus]
And Heaven knows I'm not helpless, yeah
But what can I do?
I can't see the use in me cryin'
If I'm not even tryna make the change I wanna see

[Chorus]
I can't sit and hope, I can't just sit and pray that
I can find the love when all I see is pain
Fallin' to my knees, and though I do believe
I can't just preach, baby, preach
Woah-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
I can't just preach, baby, preach

[Verse 2]
All I hear is voices, everybody's talkin'
Nothin' real is happenin' 'cause nothing is new
Now, when all this tragic, and I just feel sedated
Why do I feel numb? Is that all I can do? Yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
And Heaven knows I'm not helpless, yeah 
But I'm only human
I can't see the use in me cryin'
If I'm not even tryna make the change I wanna see

[Chorus]
I can't sit and hope, I can't just sit and pray that
I can find the love when all I see is pain
Fallin' to my knees, and though I do believe 
I can't just preach, baby, preach
Woah-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
I can't just preach, baby, preach

[Pre-Chorus]
And Heaven knows I'm not helpless
But what can I do? Yeah
I can't see the use in me cryin'
If I'm not even tryna make the change I wanna see

[Chorus]
I can't sit and hope, I can't just sit and pray that
I can find the love when all I see is pain
I try to do the things I say that I believe 
I can't just preach, baby, preach
Woah-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
I can't just preach, baby, preach
Woah-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
I can't just preach, baby, preach

[Outro]
Fallin' to my knees, and though I do believe
I can't just preach, baby, preach

[Verse 1]
Ran into you yesterday
Memories rushed through my brain
Its starting to hit me
Now you're not with me
I realized I made a mistake
Thought that I needed some space
I just let love go to waste
Its so crystal clear now
That I need you here now
Got to get you back today

[Hook]
This time I want it all
This time I want it all
I'm showing you all the cards
Giving you all my heart
This time I'll take a chance
This time I'll be your man
I can be all you need
This time it's all of me

[Verse 2]
I hit the bar every night
Looking to score a good time
Its not like I planned it
But left empty handed
Cause I'm still alone in my mind
Now what will it take to feel right
Can I come see you tonight
Is there someone new now
What can I do now
Cause I need you back by my side

[Hook]
This time I want it all
This time I want it all
I'm showing you all the cards
Giving you all my heart
This time I'll take a chance
This time I'll be your man
I can be all you need
This time it's all of me

[Bridge]
Last time I wasn't sure
This time I will give you more
I'm more than sure
I'll show you
Last time I didn't know
I messed up when I let you go
I need you, don't say no

[Middle 8]
Lying alone in this room
All that is missing is you
Pick up the phone
Won't you come home

[Hook]
This time I want it all
This time I want it all
I'm showing you all the cards
Giving you all my heart
This time I'll take a chance
This time I'll be your man
I can be all you need
This time it's all of me[Produced by Darhyl Camper, Dave Tozer, John Legend & Kanye West]

[Verse 1]
Baby it seems the time is never right
You're goin' left and I'm goin' right
Its crazy
But I'm still waiting

[Prehook]
If I play my cards right
My lucks gonna strike
Until then there's a night
All I wanna do

[Hook]
Is dream, dream, dream, dream
Dream, dream, dream, dream
Like lovers do
And it might come true

[Bridge]
If I dream, dream, dream, dream
Dream, dream, dream, dream
It just might be the only time that I'm with you
When I dream, dream, dream
Dream, dream
Oh, I dream
Yes, I dream
Dream, dream
Dream, dream
They say that dreams they sometimes do come true

[Verse 2]
Your star shines so bright
You're the queen of my night
In the daytime not quite
But I'm so glad that I

[Hook]
Can dream, dream, dream, dream
Dream, dream, dream, dream
Like lovers do
And it might come true

[Verse 1: John Legend]
It gets harder everyday
But I can't seem to shake the pain
I'm trying to find the words to say, please stay
It's written all over my face
That I can't function the same when you're not here
Calling your name and no one's there

[Pre-Chorus]
And I hope one day you'll see nobody has it easy
I still can't believe you've found somebody new
But I wish you the best, I guess

[Chorus: John Legend]
Cause everybody knows, that nobody really knows
How to make it work, or how to ease the hurt
We've heard it all before
That everybody knows just how to make it right
I wish we gave it one more try
One more try, One more try, One more try
Cause everybody knows, but nobody really knows

[Verse 2: John Legend]
I don't care what people say
They're probably lonely anyway
Baby don't fill up your head with he-said, she-said
It seems like you just don't know. 
The radio's on, you're tuning me out
I'm trying to speak, you're turning me down

[Pre-Chorus]
And I know one day you'll see nobody has it easy
I still can't believe you've found somebody new
But I wish you the best, I guess

[Chorus: John Legend]
Cause everybody knows, that nobody really knows
How to make it work, or how to ease the hurt
We've heard it all before
That everybody knows just how to make it right
I wish we gave it one more try
One more try, One more try, One more try
Cause everybody knows, but nobody really knows

[Bridge: John Legend]
Oh I wish you would understand
Just an ordinary man
I wish that we have known
That everybody knows, that nobody really knows

[Pre-Chorus]
And I know one day you'll see nobody has it easy
I still can't believe you've found somebody new
But I wish you the best, I guess

[Chorus: John Legend]
Cause everybody knows, that nobody really knows
How to make it work, or how to ease the hurt
We've heard it all before
That everybody knows just how to make it right
I wish we gave it one more try
One more try, One more try, One more try
Cause everybody knows, but nobody really knows

[Intro]
Ooh I promise not to do it again
I promise not to do it

[Verse 1: John Legend]
You can't say I don't love you
Just because I cheat on you
Cause you can't see all I do
To keep you from knowing the things I do
Like erase my phone
And keep it out of town
I keep it strapped up when I sleep around
Well I should have known one day you'd find out
But you can't go and leave me now

[Hook: John Legend]
You know that I love you 
There's no one above you 
I said it the last time 
But this is the last time
Don't make me over 
Cuz I can be faithful 
Baby you're my number one 
You're my number one

[Verse 2: John Legend]
Now who is she?
What's her name?
You don't need to know about everything
We fight about this
We fight about that
You hang up the phone and call me right back
Well I'll never be something I'm not
Please don't throw away what we've got
Cuz we've been together for way too long
I was playing around but I'm coming home

[Hook: John Legend]
You know that I love you 
There's no one above you 
I said it the last time 
But this is the last time
Don't make me over 
Cuz I can be faithful 
Baby you're my number one 
You're my number one

[Verse 3: Kanye West]
I keep you laced up so you ain't gotta borrow nothing
From them broke ass friends who be bargain hunting
They say they shop on eBay  baby why is they frontin'?
They be on the internet but they never cop nothin'
I keep you in Girl what is those on your toes?
And your neck staying froze off that rose colored gold
I suppose you was told by them hoes I was cheatin'
Thinkin' my heart don't got nothing to do with my penis
He got a mind of his own and he just be seeing shit
And I don't wanna cheat but I don't be saying shit
I try to jack off he ask me who is you playin' wit?
But I know he love you he told me you was his favorite

[Hook: John Legend]
You know that I love you 
There's no one above you 
I said it the last time 
But this is the last time
Don't make me over 
Cuz I can be faithful 
Baby you're my number one 
You're my number one

[Verse 4: John Legend]
You're making it hard for me
You're messing up everything
You tell me I gotta leave
Say we over
You saw that she came over
Came in the Range Rover
Left with a hangover
Say we over
I promise I won't cheat
I promise I won't lie
I promise I'll act right
Say we over
You can't tell me
I can't have you
I can't have that
We ain't over[Produced by Dave Tozer & John Legend]

[Verse 1]
Is that music in my ear
It's like I heard nothing for a thousand years
My eyes were closed, locking in my tears

I was so surrounded but still all alone
A great big house but so far from home
How'd you breathe life in this heart of soul

[Hook]
It's like I can feel, it's like I can breathe
It's like I can live, it's like I can love
For the first time, for the first time
For the first time, for the first time

[Bridge]
I'm electric, finally exposed
You see through me, strip off all my clothes
If this is falling, then let me go, oh

[Hook]
It's like I can feel, it's like I can breathe
It's like I can live, it's like I can love
For the first time, for the first time
For the first time, for the first time

[Verse 2]
I'm finally awake and I can feel my heart
It's beating like a drum when I'm right here where you are
I can feel it, I can feel it, oh
Can you feel it

[Hook]
It's like I can feel, it's like I can breathe
It's like I can live, it's like I can love
For the first time, for the first time
For the first time, for the first time
It's like I can feel, it's like I can breathe
It's like I can live, it's like I can love
For the first time, for the first time
For the first time, for the first time[Produced by 88 Keys, Dave Tozer & Kanye West]

[Verse 1]
Broken hearts rain on our heads 'til it floods
But I wont run, Im with you, thats enough
Kiss me now so you wont run

[Hook]
Out of breath underwater
Girl you can hold on longer
Girl you can hold on longer
Girl you can hold on longer
Long as you want
Oh, oh, oh, oh

[Verse 2]
Love is an ocean
Swimming and try not to drown
Right in the waves
Praying we dont go down
In the undertow Ill pull you out

[Hook]
Out of breath underwater
Girl you can hold on longer
Girl you can hold on longer
Girl you can hold on longer
Long as you want
Oh, oh, oh, oh[Produced by Dave Tozer, Jeff Bhasker, Kanye West & Travis Scott]

[Seal]
Come sweetly, stab me through the shadow of an open door
Wait quietly now, take us to the helplessness of it all
And I wonder as I watch you slip away somehow
Wonder if the only thing left is love
Wonder if I ever will wait

[Hook]
Will I ever love again?
Will I ever love again?

[John Legend]
Oh, lie to me
Lie to me, tell me I'm not wasting time
Yeah, yeah
Oh, oh, convince me you miss me
Your heart still beats as fast as mine
Tell me lies
We loved it, loved it even more than we knew
We lost it, and I don't even know what to do
Tell me what to do
Cause I wonder why it had to slip away somehow
I wonder if you'll ever wanna see me now
I wonder if I'll ever be the same

[Hook]
Will I ever love again?
Will I ever love again?


[Bridge]
Oh, you eyes haunt me, taunt me, pierce straight through my heart again
Will it ever end?
Cause I

[Seal + John Legend]
Wonder as I watch you slip away somehow
I wonder if you ever wanna see me now
I wonder if I'll ever wait

[Hook]
Will I ever love again?
Will I ever love again?

[Verse 1: John Legend]
Fire and the ice colliding, I wanna go deep and dive in
It's heaven on Earth  but hell of a night to melt into one
She's never been afraid of sirens, head down but keep drivin'
Damn we might crash moving so fast but baby

[Chorus: John Legend & Brittany Howard]
Don't stop, I need it
Release me, it's too hard for me to hold
My heart beating, your touch, it thrills me to the bone
Oh Lord, forgive us, honest, we've lost control baby
Nothing can stop this love, nothing can stop this love
Never gon' get enough, nothing can stop it, oh

[Verse 2: Brittany Howard]
Darkness and light, streaming, the end of our life beginning
No longer alone, my will become gone, we melt into one
Both hands on the floor, you go low
Who was I before? I don't know
And who am I now? Your body shows how
The past just has no meaning

[Chorus: John Legend & Brittany Howard]
Don't stop, I need it
Release me, it's too hard for me to hold
My heart bleeding, your touch, it thrills me to the bone
Oh Lord, forgive us, honest, we've lost control baby
Nothing can stop this love, nothing can stop this love
Never gon' get enough, nothing can stop it, oh

[Bridge: John Legend]
Oh yeah, yeah

[Chorus: John Legend & Brittany Howard]
Oh, don't stop, I need it
Release me, it's too hard for me to hold
My heart bleeding, your touch, it thrills me to the bone
Oh Lord, forgive us, honest, we've lost control baby
Nothing can stop this love, nothing can stop this love
Never gon' get enough, nothing can stop it[Produced by Kanye West]

Holla, holla, hollaaaaa
Holla, holla, hollaaaaa

[Verse 1]
Maybe It's me, maybe I bore you
No, no it's my fault cause I can't afford you
Maybe Baby, Puffy, or Jay Z
Would all be better for you
Cause all I could do was love you

[Chorus]
Baby when I used to love you
There's nuttin that I wouldn't do
I went through the fire for you
Anything you asked me to
But I'm tired of living this lie
It's getting harder to justify
I realize that I just don't love you
Not like I used to
Holla, holla, hollaaaaa 
Holla, holla, hollaaaaa 

[Verse 2]
Maybe I should rob somebody
So we could live like
Whitney and Bobby
It's probably my fault
My bad, My loss
You are above cost
All I could do was love you

[Chorus]
Baby when I used to love you
There's nuttin that I wouldn't do
I went through the fire for you
Anything you asked me to

[Verse 1]
What goes underneath your armor
Underneath your clothes
Do you know?
Let's find out together
Let's find what we're looking for
We'll explore

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Leave your house of mirrors, hear me out
Fear no consequence, forget your doubts

[Chorus]
I don't know where the road leads
You don't know if I'll break your heart
We don't know how the winds will blow
And we won't know
We won't go unless we start
Ooh, ooh, start

[Verse 2]
Fall into the sea of possibility
And hope
We're letting go
Float away with me
Until we can't see any coast
That we know

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Hold on tight until we become one
Find our island underneath the sun

[Chorus]
I don't know where the road leads
You don't know if I'll break your heart
And we don't know how the winds will blow
And we won't know
We won't go unless we start
Ooh, ooh, ooh, start, yeah

[Bridge]
Our beloved beside us
All you want to give up
Only happens if we let it live

[Chorus]
And I don't know where the road leads
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
You don't know if I'll break your heart
We don't know how the winds will blow
And we won't know
We won't go unless we start
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, start, yeah

[Outro]
Oh unless we start
Ooh, oh, let's start, yeah
Unless we start

[Verse 1]
Go from zero to a hundred and up it crazy
Don't believe it when you say that you fuckin' hate me, no
Use your tongue to crucify me, you motivate me, oh I
Throwing down when it ends up with your legs around me
Your legs around me, oh
I rise, you fall, we wreck it all
My pride is at your beck and call

[Chorus]
That's what you do to me
That's what you do to me
That's what you do to me
That's what you do to me
That's what you do, you always do me right
Screaming through the night
Make me love and hate you at the same time
That's what you do to me
That's what you do to me, yeah
That's what you do, you watch me lose my mind
Make me feel like I...
I would die if you were out of my life
That's what you do to me

[Verse 2]
I could stop, I could leave, but no, I don't wanna
It's a mess I'm obsessed with your kind of torture
It's my kind of torture
Oh, I rise, you fall, we wreck it all
You kill me with every kiss and don't you know...

[Chorus]
That's what you do to me
That's what you do to me
That's what you do to me

Make me feel like I...
I would die if you were out of my life
That's what you do to me

[Verse 1]
Baby, since the day you came into my life
You made me realize that we were born to fly
You showed me everyday new possibilities
You proved my fantasy of love could really be

[Bridge]
Let's go to a place only lovers go
To a spot that we've never known
To the top of the clouds we're floating away yeah

[Chorus]
Ooh this feels so crazy
Oh this love is blazing
And baby we're so high
Walking on cloud 9
 So high
 So high
 Oh


[Verse 2]
Maybe later we can go up to the moon
Or sail among the stars before the night is through
And when morning comes we'll see the sun is not so far
And we can't get much closer to God than where we are

[Bridge]
Let's go to a place only lovers go
To a spot that we've never known
To the top of the clouds we're floating away yeah

[Chorus]
Ooh this feels so crazy
Oh this love is blazing
And baby we're so high
Walking on cloud 9
 So high

Oh don't you know we're gonna get together
Your way to tomorrow
Don't wait til tomorrow
Oh we're gonna get together

[Verse 1]
They say sing what you know
But I've sung what they want
Some folks do what they're told
But baby this time I won't
When I look through that door
I know the truth from lie
Some things I've done before I can't justify

[Pre-Chorus]
There are kings in my past
Things no one can be proud of
But I stand in the light I've cast
And turn away from any lack of love
Oh, when I walked through that door
I say here I go
You see me and nothing more
I'm singing what I know

[Chorus]
I know better
I know better

[Verse 2]
Legend is just a name
I know better than to be so proud
I won't drink in all this fame
I'll take more love than I'm allowed

[Pre-Chorus]
I won't hide or cut it off from where it came
My history has brought me to this place
This power and the color of my face

[Chorus]
And I know better
Oh, I know better

[Bridge]
Oh, I'll rise from the floor if I don't win
I'll bust open that door so let me in
And if music chooses me to sing I let her
I'll sing what I know, yes

[Chorus]
I know better, oh
I know better, yes
I know better
I know better

[Chorus]
Oh, she's sweet but a psycho
A little bit psycho
At night she's screamin', "I'm-ma-ma-ma out my mind"
Oh, she's hot but a psycho
So left but she's right though
At night she's screamin', "I'm-ma-ma-ma out my mind"

[Verse 1]
She'll make you curse, but she a blessing
She'll rip your shirt within a second
You'll be coming back, back for seconds
With your plate, you just can't help it

[Pre-Chorus]
No, no
You'll play alo-o-ong, let her lead you o-o-on
You'll be saying, "No, no"
Then saying, "Yes, yes, yes," 'cause she messin' with your head

[Chorus]
Oh, she's sweet but a psycho
A little bit psycho
At night she's screamin', "I'm-ma-ma-ma out my mind"
Oh, she's hot but a psycho
So left but she's right though
At night she's screamin', "I'm-ma-ma-ma out my mind"

[Post-Chorus]
Grab a cop gun kinda crazy
She's poison but tasty
Yeah, people say, "Run, don't walk away"
'Cause she's sweet but a psycho
A little bit psycho
At night she screamin', "I'm-ma-ma-ma out my mind"

[Verse 2]
See, someone said, "Don't drink her potions
She'll kiss your neck with no emotion
When she's mean, you know you love it
She tastes so sweet, don't sugarcoat it"

[Pre-Chorus]
No, no
You'll play alo-o-ong, let her lead you o-o-on
You'll be saying, "No , no "
Then saying, "Yes, yes, yes," 'cause she messin' with your head

[Chorus]
Oh, she's sweet but a psycho
A little bit psycho
At night she's screamin', "I'm-ma-ma-ma out my mind"
Oh, she's hot but a psycho
So left but she's right though
At night she's screamin', "I'm-ma-ma-ma out my mind"

[Post-Chorus]
Grab a cop gun kinda crazy
She's poison but tasty
Yeah, people say, "Run, don't walk away"
'Cause she's sweet but a psycho
A little bit psycho
At night she screamin', "I'm-ma-ma-ma out my mind"

[Bridge]
You're just like me, you're out your mind
I know it's strange, we're both the crazy kind
You're tellin' me that I'm insane
Boy, don't pretend that you don't love the pain

[Chorus]
Oh, she's sweet but a psycho
A little bit psycho
At night she's screamin', "I'm-ma-ma-ma out my mind"
Oh, she's hot but a psycho
So left but she's right though
At night she's screamin', "I'm-ma-ma-ma out my mind"

[Post-Chorus]
Grab a cop gun kinda crazy
She's poison but tasty
Yeah, people say "Run, don't walk away"
'Cause she's sweet but a psycho
A little bit psycho
At night she screamin', "I'm-ma-ma-ma out my mind"

[Chorus]
Do you ever feel like a misfit?
Everything inside you is dark and twisted
Oh, but it's okay to be different
'Cause baby, so am I 

[Verse 1]
Can you hear the whispers all across the room?
You feel her eyes all over you like cheap perfume
You're beautiful, but misunderstood
So why you tryna be just like the neighborhood?

[Pre-Chorus]
I can see ya, I know what you're feelin'
So let me tell you 'bout my little secret
I'm a little crazy underneath this
Underneath this

[Chorus]
Do you ever feel like a misfit?
Everything inside you is dark and twisted
Oh, but it's okay to be different
'Cause baby, so am I 
Do you ever feel like an outcast?
You don't have to fit into the format
Oh, but it's okay to be different
'Cause baby, so am I 

[Verse 2]
Oh so, dress up fancy like Sid and Nancy 
Walkin' Killer Queen, gotta keep 'em guessin'
So baby come pass me a lighter
We're gonna leave 'em on fire
We're the sinners and the blessings

[Pre-Chorus]
I can see ya, I know what you're feelin'
So let me tell you 'bout my little secret
I'm a little crazy underneath this
Underneath this, ooh

[Chorus]
Do you ever feel like a misfit?
Everything inside you is dark and twisted
Oh, but it's okay to be different
'Cause baby, so am I 
Do you ever feel like an outcast?
You don't have to fit into the format
Oh, but it's okay to be different
'Cause baby, so am I 

[Bridge]

You're king and you're queen
You're strong then you're weak
You're bound but so free

So come and join me
And call me Harley
And we'll make 'em scream

[Chorus]
Do you ever feel like a misfit?
Everything inside you is dark and twisted
Oh, but it's okay to be different
'Cause baby, so am I 
Do you ever feel like an outcast?
You don't have to fit into the format
Oh, but it's okay to be different
'Cause baby, so am I 

[Chorus]
Not your barbie girl, I'm livin' in my own world

Pull up to that dream house, god gate heels down
How much do you like this?
Welcome to my bedroom, hallway go down

Words don't tempt me, tryin' to break me
In these heels I ain't tryin' to trip, no

[Pre-Chorus]
I can take myself on a dinner date
Buy myself diamonds and a champagne

And it's not about you, oh-oh
Oh-oh, I've been breaking hearts too
And I learned it all from you, oh-oh

[Pre-Chorus]
I got my thigh-highs on, feel like Wonder Woman
That's when you want all in, but I'm not your woman
When my lipstick pops and I feel like Monroe
That's when you want me most, oh-oh

[Chorus]
I'm all out of salt, I'm not gonna cry
Won't give you what you want
'Cause I look way too good tonight
I'm all out of salt, tears are running dry
Won't give you what you want
'Cause I look way too good tonight

Like my snakeskin Saint Laurent, oh-oh

I got my thigh-highs on, feel like Wonder Woman
That's when you want all in, but I'm not your woman

[Verse 1]
You, you take all of the li-li-light away
But, but then you give me fireworks
I, I think of leaving ni-ni-night and day
But, but then you always find the words

[Pre-Chorus]
You're contagious, baby
Love when you love me, hate me
The way you rock, ro-ro-rock my body lately
You set the rain on fire
I wish the lows were higher
Wish I could stop, stop, stop to save me

[Chorus]
Oh I wanna stay, wanna walk out the door
Oh no, right now baby Im torn
I can't get enough, can't take anymore
Oh no, right now baby Im torn
You dry my tears and make it pour
You show me love and give me war
I can't get enough, can't take anymore
Oh no, right now baby I'm torn

[Verse 2]
I, I always want to run, run, run away
But, but then I crawl into your arms
It, it's like we're starting drama every day
But, but you know that's my favorite part

[Pre-Chorus]
You're contagious, baby
Love when you love me, hate me
The way you rock, ro-ro-rock my body lately
You set the rain on fire
I wish the lows were higher
Wish I could stop, stop, stop to save me

[Chorus]
Oh I wanna stay, wanna walk out the door
Oh no, right now baby Im torn
I cant get enough, can't take anymore
Oh no, right now baby Im torn
You dry my tears and make it pour
You show me love and give me war
I can't get enough, can't take anymore
Oh no, right now baby I'm torn

[Post-Chorus]



[Bridge]
Torn from the pages out of our book
A beautiful tragedy
I'm torn in between heaven and hell
'Cause baby when I'm with you
I just don't know where I'd rather be

[Chorus]
Oh I wanna stay, wanna walk out the door
Oh no, right now baby I'm torn
I can't get enough, can't take anymore
Oh no, right now baby I'm torn
You dry my tears and make it pour
You show me love and give me war
I can't get enough, can't take anymore
Oh no, right now baby I'm torn

[Chorus]
If all of the kings had their queens on the throne
We would pop champagne andraisea toast
To allof the queens who are fightingalone
Baby, you're not dancing on your own

[Verse 1]
Can't live without me, you wanna, but you can't, nah-nah-nah
Think it's funny, but honey, can't run this show on your own
I can feel my body shake, there's only so much I can take
I'll show you how a real queen behaves

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, no damsel in distress, don't need to save me
Once I start breathing fire, you can't tame me
And you might think I'm weak without a sword
But if I had one, it'd be bigger than yours

[Chorus]
If all of the kings had their queens on the throne
We would pop champagne and raise a toast
To all of the queens who are fighting alone
Baby, you're not dancing on your own

[Verse 2]
Disobey me, then baby, it's off with your head
Gonna change it and make it a world you won't forget

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, no damsel in distress, don't need to save me
Once I start breathing fire, you can't tame me
And you might think I'm weak without a sword
But I'm stronger than I ever was before

[Chorus]
If all of the kings had their queens on the throne
We would pop champagne and raise a toast
To all of the queens who are fighting alone
Baby, you're not dancing on your own

[Bridge]
In chess, the king can move one space at a time
But queens are free to go wherever they like
You get too close, you'll get a royalty high
So breathe it in to feel alive

[Chorus]
If all of the kings had their queens on the throne
We would pop champagne and raise a toast
To all of the queens who are fighting alone
Baby, you're not dancing on your own

[Outro]
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh

[Verse 1]
Empty mansion, in the rain just off the coast
Is the vibe now, that I feel inside my soul
Like a spider, there's a web that you have wove
There's a heart now, where there used to be a ghost

[Pre-Chorus]
And ooh, yeah it's making me uneasy

[Chorus]
Now I hear sounds in the hallway
Rocking chairs are moving on their own
I'm falling for you
So much so that it's freaking me out
So much so that it's freaking me out
So much so that it's freaking me

[Verse 2]
There's a silence, in the woods after it snows
That's the vibe now, of the piece inside my soul
Like a spider, there's a web that you have wove
There's a heart now, where there used to be a ghost

[Pre-Chorus]
And ooh, yeah it's making me uneasy

[Chorus]
Now I hear sounds in the hallway
Rocking chairs are moving on their own
I'm falling for you
So much so that it's freaking me out
So much so that it's freaking me out
So much so that it's freaking me
Sounds in the hallway
Rocking chairs are moving on their own
I'm falling for you
So much so that it's freaking me out
So much so that it's freaking me out
So much so that it's freaking me

[Bridge]
Do, doo, do, doo, do, doo, do, doo, do, doo, do, doo, doo, do
Do, do, doo, do
Do, doo, do, doo, do, doo, do, doo, do, doo, do, doo, doo, do

Scary but it's beautiful

[Chorus]
Sounds in the hallway
Rocking chairs are moving on their own
I'm falling for you
So much so that it's freaking me out
So much so that it's freaking me out
So much so that it's freaking me out
Sounds in the hallway
Rocking chairs are moving on their own
I'm falling for you
So much so that it's freaking me out
So much so that it's freaking me out
So much so that it's freaking me

[Verse 1]
My momma use to say
"Baby make me proud
You've got such a pretty face
But such a dirty mouth"
But how come when I tell you
What's on my mind like men do
I'm called crazy?
Crazy

[Pre-Chorus]
This is not a love song
This is not a sing along
But ladies, are you with me?
I know that you're with me

[Chorus]
Add a little sugar, they say
Be a little sweeter, they say
Gotta give and take, but I say
This time it's my way, ah, my way
Be a little proper, they say
Speak a little softer, they say
Gotta be a lady, but I say
This time it's my way, ah, my way
This time it's my way, ah, my way
This time it's my way, ah, my way

I'll do me
You do you
I don't need nobody's permission
I won't back down
Win or lose
Oh yeah, one and only limited edition

This is not a love song
This is not a sing along
But ladies, are you with me?
I know that you're with me

[Chorus]
Add a little sugar, they say
Be a little sweeter, they say
Gotta give and take, but I say
This time it's my way, ah, my way
Be a little proper, they say
Speak a little softer, they say
Gotta be a lady, but I say
This time it's my way, ah, my way


[Outro]
This time it's my way, ah, my way
This time it's my way, ah, my way
This time it's my way, ah, my way
This time it's my way, ah, my way

[Chorus]
Just wanna be loved

You were the one I started falling
You got me down on the down low
Waiting for something
You are my baby, you call me baby
How could I've been so wrong?
Ho-how could I've been so wrong?

[Pre-Chorus]
You think I'm burning in hell while you out in paradise?

Wishing I went somewhere else and left you in my dreams

Long nights with you

We both wanna stop it but we can't

I can see ya, I know what you're feelin'
So let me tell you 'bout my little secret
I'm a little crazy underneath this
Underneath this

[Chorus: Ava Max]
Do you ever feel like a misfit?
Everything inside you is dark and twisted
Oh, but it's okay to be different
'Cause baby, so am I 
Do you ever feel like an outcast?
You don't have to fit into the format
Oh, but it's okay to be different
'Cause baby, so am I 

[Verse 2: Taeyong]
Baby,      
  Grinch   Berserker 
    
   
  
 ?

[Pre-Chorus: Mark]
Baby you lit, so am I
I think you real, so am I
I like your walk and your vibe 
Baby you lit, so am I
I think you real, so am I
I know that you, you meant I
Just tell me one time

[Chorus: Ava Max & Jaeyhun]
Do you ever feel like a misfit?
Everything inside you is dark and twisted
Oh, but it's okay to be different
'Cause baby, so am I 
Do you ever feel like an outcast?
You don't have to fit into the format
Oh, but it's okay to be different
'Cause baby, so am I 

[Bridge: Ava Max]

You're king and you're queen
You're strong then you're weak
You're bound but so free

So come and join me
And call me Harley
And we'll make 'em scream

[Chorus: Ava Max]
Do you ever feel like a misfit?
Everything inside you is dark and twisted
Oh, but it's okay to be different
'Cause baby, so am I 
Do you ever feel like an outcast?
You don't have to fit into the format
Oh, but it's okay to be different
'Cause baby, so am I 

[Verse 1: Ava Max]
You're not afraid to touch me
But you're afraid to love me
Why you scared?
'Cause baby, I'm right here
You should know you're lucky
That you can have some of me
Tell me why you scared
'Cause baby, I'm right here

[Pre-Chorus: Ava Max]
I'm not sayin' you're heartless
You're just using your heart a little less
I'm not trying to be obsessed
Just not ready to let you go yet

[Chorus: Ava Max]
You're slippin', slippin through my fingers
And I'm grippin', grippin' on your body
Where do you think that you're goin'?
Ain't no one better you know it
Boy you're slippin', baby, you're slippin'
Slippin', slippin' through my fingers
And I'm grippin', grippin' on your body
Where do you think that you're goin'?
Ain't no one better you know it
Boy you're slippin', baby, you're slippin'

[Verse 2: Ava Max]
Last week in the sauna
Yeah, we made our genre
But then you disappeared
Baby, I'm right here
If you want good karma
Why you causin' drama?
I smell your fear
Let's get one thing clear

[Pre-Chorus: Ava Max]
I'm not sayin' you're heartless
You're just using your heart a little less
I'm not trying to be obsessed
Just not ready to let you go yet

[Chorus: Ava Max]
You're slippin', slippin through my fingers
And I'm grippin', grippin' on your body
Where do you think that you're goin'?
Ain't no one better you know it
Boy you're slippin', baby, you're slippin'
Slippin', slippin' through my fingers
And I'm grippin', grippin' on your body
Where do you think that you're goin'?
Ain't no one better you know it
Boy you're slippin', baby, you're slippin'

[Verse 3: GASHI]
Slippin', fallin'
I'm tryna get up now
I never knew what love is
Show me that right now
You know I copped you the foreign
You know that I'm never boring
You the one that always ignorin'
I'm the one always that's callin'
I swear that they prayin' that we broke up
Put it on me like a coaster
Everyday we gettin' closer
Stuck to you just like a poster
Wearin' my heart over my sleeve
You got your head on my shoulder
You know that I'm never gon' leave
I'm in it till it's over

[Chorus: Ava Max]
You're slippin', slippin through my fingers
And I'm grippin', grippin' on your body
Where do you think that you're goin'?
Ain't no one better you know it
Boy you're slippin', baby, you're slippin'
Slippin', slippin' through my fingers
And I'm grippin', grippin' on your body
Where do you think that you're goin'?
Ain't no one better you know it
Boy you're slippin', baby, you're slippin'

Oh, she's hot but a psycho
So left but she's right though
At night she's screamin'
"I'm-ma-ma-ma out my mind"

She'll make you curse, but she a blessing
She'll rip your shirt within a second
You'll be coming back, back for seconds
With your plate, you just can't help it

Let her lead you o-o-on
You'll be saying "No, no"

[Bridge]
You're just like me, you're out your mind
I know it's strange, we're both the crazy kind
You're tellin' me that I'm insane
Boy, don't pretend that you don't love the pain
Oh, yeah
"I'm-ma-ma-ma out my mind"
Oh, oh
"I'm-ma-ma-ma out my mind"[Snippet]
I should just tattoo them right upon my face
Because the pain I feel is permanent[Snippet]

[Chorus]
Play that song I like
Pull it on me right
Got heaven on my mind
But I'm no angel
No promises tonight
Show me a darker side
Got heaven on my mind
But I'm no angel

Oooh-oooh-ooh-ooh!
Oooh-oooh-ooh-ooh!
I'm no angel
Oooh-oooh-ooh-ooh!

Got me fee, fee, feeling for more

Wanna knock, knock, knock on the door

[Verse 1]
I was in pieces, pieces
I was the weakest, weakest
I couldn't believe it, -lieve it
I was at my lowest low
I said I would be there, be there
Oh I didn't need this, need this
I'm done with the weakness, weakness
Gotta show 'em that I'm bold

[Pre-Chorus]
You're just another voice talking off my ear
Just another enemy
I've been here before now I've got no fears
Tell 'em that I'm ready

[Chorus]
So go ahead, cause I've left
I'm jet set
No one can pull me down
No rain can't stop me
I'll fly away, watch me from the ground
Keep me with your words
They'll just bounce right back
Now it never hurts when you talk like that
So go ahead, cause I've left
I'm jet set
No one can pull me down

[Verse 2]
Now I'm a flyer, flyer
So over the fighters, fighters
They're getting me higher, higher
I just let 'em watch me coast

[Bridge]
No one can pull me down
Holding on, holding on
Something is missing
Holding on, holding on
The rest is unwritten

[Pre-Chorus]
Just another voice talking off my ear
Just another enemy
I've been here before now I've got no fears
Tell 'em that I'm ready

[Chorus]
So go ahead  cause I've left
I'm jet set
No one can pull me down
No rain can't stop me
I fly away, watch me from the ground
Keep me with your words
They'll just bounce right back 
Now it never hurts when you talk like that 
So go ahead, cause I've left
I'm jet set
No one can pull me down

And there's nothing you can do
That'll make it right
And there's nothing you can say

There is no happy ending
To the story

Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

Nothing you can do to make it right

'Cause I'm not tryin' to be that girl
And cry about it, cry about it

If you wanna break my heart
[Verse 1]
Got me wide awake and dreamin'
You give love a deeper meanin'
Keep exposing all my secrets
And you know you got my heart beatin'

[Pre-Chorus]
Out my chest
Out of breath
Don't give up
Not till we're above the clouds
I give it till there's nothing left
I'm obsessed
Keep it up
We ain't ever coming down

[Chorus]
Every time I close my eyes
All I see is flashing lights
Make me feel like I can fly
Higher than a satellite

Higher than a satellite

Higher than a satellite

[Drop]

[Verse 2]
When we get to where we're goin'
Come and fill me with emotion
Oh you leave my body glowin'
And you know you got my heart beatin'

[Pre-Chorus]
Out my chest
Out of breath
Don't give up
Not till we're above the clouds
I give it till there's nothing left
I'm obsessed
Keep it up
We ain't ever coming down


[Chorus]
Every time I close my eyes
All I see is flashing lights
Make me feel like I can fly
Higher than a satellite

Higher than a satellite

Higher than a satellite

[Drop]

[Verse 1]
I'm all alone, thinking in my head
Begin the words that I'd never say
Feels just like yesterday, you left my bed
You were the match and we were heaven sent

[Pre-Chorus]
Thought that I could catch myself from falling
Underneath the spell you put upon me
Now I see you every time I close my eyes
I close my eyes

[Chorus]
I tried it all but nothing, nothing compares
I miss your hands just running straight through my hair
I have no life without you giving me air
Oh, baby come home, oh, baby come home
I tried to fall again but it wasn't the same
I missed your heartbeat on me everyday
I'm a disaster pouring harder than rain
Oh, baby come home, oh, baby come home

[Verse 2]
You're going wild, gonna bring you close
I'm getting wild at my head at home
Where are you now? Yet, I never know
Come feels you spreading through my every bone

[Pre-Chorus]
Thought that I could catch myself from falling
Underneath the spell you put upon me
Now I see you every time I close my eyes
I close my eyes

[Chorus]
I tried it all but nothing, nothing compares
I miss your hands just running straight through my hair
I have no life without you giving me air
Oh, baby come home, oh, baby come home
I tried to fall again but it wasn't the same
I missed your heartbeat on me everyday
I'm a disaster pouring harder than rain
Oh, baby come home, oh, baby come home

[Bridge]
And no one can do what you do
Oh, no one can move like you move
I shouldn't have left like a fool
Oh, no one can do what you do

[Chorus]
I tried it all but nothing, nothing compares
I miss your hands just running straight through my hair
I have no life without you giving me air
Oh, baby come home, oh, baby come home
I tried to fall again but it wasn't the same
I missed your heartbeat on me everyday
I'm a disaster pouring harder than rain
Oh, baby come home, oh, baby come home

[Outro]
Cause no one can do like you do
So, come home
Cause no one can move like you move

[Verse 1]
I told myself I couldnt do it
Face another day when I knew it
All too well and all too soon
You were taken from my life
It's like you get used to the pain
You cant see the sun shining in the rain
So I smile and keep it inside
Cause I dont wanna cry

[Pre-Chorus]
You, you were my friend, until the end
But now I have to let you go

[Chorus]
Please tell me why I write these lines
When youre nothing but a memory that burns a hole
Deep inside my mind and I keep these words to myself
And when I close my eyes
I miss you more, I miss you more
More than words can say

[Verse 2]
Tell me what it takes and Ill do it 
I close my eyes cause I wanna get through this
And now your face is just a faded photograph
Sometimes, something's so good that it can't last
So many things I wanted to show you
So many things I wanted to tell you
You're in my heart, I just wanted you to know
A piece of you is with me wherever I go

[Pre-Chorus]
Now its just too late
I have the chance to say goodbye
But then I let it slip away

[Chorus]
Please tell me why I write these lines
When youre nothing but a memory that burns a hole
Deep inside my mind and I keep these words to myself
And when I close my eyes
I miss you more, I miss you more
More than words can say

[Bridge]
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh

[Chorus]
Please tell me why I write these lines
When youre nothing but a memory that burns a hole
Deep inside my mind and I keep these words to myself
And when I close my eyes
I miss you more, I miss you more
More than words can say

And I dont know why, but I feel like the way I do
Its all too much and I just need some time
To not keep these words to myself
And when I close my eyes
I miss you more, I miss you more
More than words can say

[Verse 1]
Sound of your voice
Relinquish the pain in my heart in the night
In the down of your choice
It's got me caught in this spark of the fire

[Pre-Chorus]
But, I can't hold my breath
If you just keep leading me on
And I can't hold you back
But it's all that I want

[Chorus]
You keep coming up, keep coming down
All of the time
You caught me around, spinning around
All of the time
Still running away like you do
I'm chasing your heart like a fool
You keep coming up, keep coming down
All of the time

[Verse 2]
Make up your mind
Cause you're playing my life that strings of a guitar
Lay it down, at the door
I'm at the corner, I can't take it no more

[Pre-Chorus]
But, I can't hold my breath
If you just keep leading me on
And I can't hold you back
But it's all that I want

[Chorus]
You keep coming up, keep coming down
All of the time
You caught me around, spinning around
All of the time
Still running away like you do
I'm chasing your heart like a fool
Keep coming- keep coming up, keep coming down
All of the time

[Bridge]
I can't make your heart want me
You put in my strength to the test
I can't scream my words into the
'Cause I'm just wasting my breath
Wasting my
Wasting my
Cause I'm just wasting my breath

[Chorus]
You keep coming up, keep coming down
All of the time
You caught me around, spinning around
All of the time
Still running away like you do
I'm chasing your heart like a fool
Keep coming- keep coming up, keep coming down
All of the time

[Verse]
How are you, how you been?
Where you living these days?
I saw you moved on with it
Everyone, everything said you needed a change
But can I be honest?

[Chorus]
Seeing you again makes we wanna try again
Makes me really wanna try again
Takes me back to when we thought it would never end
Can we try and go back to then?

[Verse 1]
This night is cold in the kingdom
I can feel you fade away
From the kitchen to the bathroom sink and
Your steps keep me awake

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't cut me down, throw me out, leave me here to waste
I once was a man with dignity and grace
Now I'm slipping through the cracks of your cold embrace
So please, please

[Chorus]
Could you find a way to let me down slowly?
A little sympathy, I hope you can show me
If you wanna go, then I'll be so lonely
If you're leaving, baby let me down slowly
Let me down, down
Let me down, down
Let me down, let me down
Down, let me down, down
Let me down
If you wanna go, then I'll be so lonely
If you're leaving, baby let me down slowly

[Verse 2]
Cold skin, drag my feet on the tile
As I'm walking down the corridor
And I know we haven't talked in a while
So I'm looking for an open door

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't cut me down, throw me out, leave me here to waste
I once was a man with dignity and grace
Now I'm slipping through the cracks of your cold embrace
So please, please

[Chorus]
Could you find a way to let me down slowly?
A little sympathy, I hope you can show me
If you wanna go, then I'll be so lonely
If you're leaving, baby let me down slowly
Let me down, down
Let me down, down
Let me down, let me down
Down, let me down, down
Let me down
If you wanna go, then I'll be so lonely
If you're leaving, baby let me down slowly

And I can't stop myself from falling down
And I can't stop myself from falling down
And I can't stop myself from falling down
And I can't stop myself from falling down

A little sympathy, I hope you can show me
If you wanna go, then I'll be so lonely
If you're leaving, baby let me down slowly
Let me down, down
Let me down, down
Let me down, let me down
Down, let me down, down
Let me down
If you wanna go, then I'll be so lonely

If you wanna go, then I'll be so lonely
If you're leaving, baby let me down slowly

[Verse 1]
Outrunning karma
That boy, he's such a charmer
All the bugs and their larva
Follow him out to Colorado
Ten dozen hearts in a bag
Their bodies lying
He'll drag them down to Colorado
A modern desperado

[Pre-Chorus]
And he'll race for miles through the night
He runs because he knows he cannot hide

[Chorus]
He's never gonna make it
All the poor people he's forsaken
Karma is always gonna chase him for his lies
It's just a game of waiting
From the church steeple down to Satan
Karma, there's really no escape until he dies

[Verse 2]
Outrunning karma
That boy can't run no farther
It's the last days of Sparta
Follow him down to meet Apollo

[Pre-Chorus]
And he'll brace for battle in the night
He'll fight because he knows he cannot hide

[Chorus]
He's never gonna make it
All the poor people he's forsaken
Karma is always gonna chase him for his lies
It's just a game of waiting
From the church steeple down to Satan
Karma, there's really no escape until he dies

[Verse 1]
She told me that she loved me by the water fountain
She told me that she loved me and she didn't love him
And that was really lovely 'cause it was innocent
But now she's got a cup with something else in it
It's getting kind of blurry at a quarter past ten
And he was in a hurry to be touching her skin
She's feeling kind of dirty when she's dancing with him
Forgetting what she told me by the water fountain

[Pre-Chorus]
Now he's grabbing her hips, and pulling her in
Kissing her lips, and whispering in her ear
And she knows that she shouldn't listen
And that she should be with me by the water fountain

[Chorus]
She couldn't be at home in the night time because
It made her feel alone, but at that time she was too young
I was too young
I should've built a home with a fountain for us
The moment that she told me that she was in love
Too young, I was too young
Too young, too young, too young, young

[Verse 2]
And if she ever goes back to the water fountain
The handle will be broken and the rust set in
But my hand, it will be open and I'll try to fix it
My heart, it will be open and I'll try to give it

[Pre-Chorus]
Now I'm grabbing her hips, and pulling her in
Kissing her lips, and whispering in her ear
And I know that it's only a wish
And that we're not standing by the water fountain
Too young, too young, too young, young

[Chorus]
She couldn't be at home in the night time
Because it made her feel alone
But at that time she was too young
I was too young
I should've built a home with a fountain for us
The moment that she told me that she was in love
Too young, I was too young
Too young, too young, too young, young

[Outro]
 I should've built a home with a fountain for us
 The moment that she told me that she was in love
 Too young
 I was too young

[Verse 1]
I built a friend
With three pieces of plastic and a pen
I made him on the table in the den
I gave him my old cell phone for a head, for a head
And we spent holidays at my house
And we left presents in a stocking
And we bought bolts and things and strings
And a new watch, that's what he got

[Chorus]
And we had so much fun together
We knew we'd be friends forever
And we had so much fun together
We had so much fun

[Verse 2]
Then I left for college in September
And we wept cause we can't be together
So I kept pictures to remember my old friend, my old friend
Then I met this girl at graduation
And forget my oldest creation
And I guess I'll see him next vacation
Send my best, I send my best

[Chorus]
And we had so much fun together
We knew we'd be friends forever
And we had so much fun together
We had so much fun

[Bridge]
I came home to find him on the table
With a note, scribbled out in pencil
And he wrote
That he just wasn't stable all alone, all alone
Next to him, an empty glass of water
That he spilt
All over the body that I built
It fizzled and it popped
And then it killed, and then it killed

[Chorus]
And we had so much fun together
We thought we'd be friends forever
And we had so much fun together
We had so much fun
I built a friend

[Verse 1]
It was 6:48, I was walking home
Stepped through the gate, and I'm all alone
I had chicken on the plate, but the food was cold
Then I covered up my face so that no one knows
I didn't want trouble, I'm the boy in the bubble
But then came trouble
When my mom walked into the living room
She said, "Boy, you gotta tell me what they did to you"
I said, "You don't wanna know the things I had to do"
She said, "Son, you gotta tell me why you're black and blue"
I said I didn't want trouble, I'm the boy in the bubble
But then came trouble

[Pre-Chorus]
And my heart was pumping, chest was screaming
Mind was running, air was freezing
Put my hands up, put my hands up
I told this kid I'm ready for a fight

[Chorus]
Punch my face, do it 'cause I like the pain
Every time you curse my name
I know you want the satisfaction, it's not gonna happen
Knock me out, kick me when I'm on the ground
It's only gonna let you down
Come the lightning and the thunder
You're the one who'll suffer, suffer

[Verse 2]
Well, I squared him up, left my chest exposed
He threw a quick left hook and it broke my nose
I had thick red blood running down my clothes
And a sick, sick look 'cause I like it though
I said I didn't want trouble, I'm the boy in the bubble
But then came trouble

[Pre-Chorus]
And my heart was pumping, chest was screaming
Mind was running, nose was bleeding
Put my hands up, put my hands up
I told this kid I'm ready for a fight

[Chorus]
Punch my face, do it 'cause I like the pain
Every time you curse my name
I know you want the satisfaction, it's not gonna happen
Knock me out, kick me when I'm on the ground
It's only gonna let you down
Come the lightning and the thunder
You're the one who'll suffer

[Verse 3]
It was 6:48, he was walking home
With the blood on his hands from my broken nose
But like every other day, he was scared to go
Back to his house 'cause his pops was home
Drowning his troubles in whiskey bubbles
Just looking for trouble
Well, there's no excuse for the things he did
But there's a lot at home that he's dealing with
Because his dad's been drunk since he was a kid
And I hope one day that he'll say to him
"Put down those bubbles and that belt buckle
In this broken bubble"

[Chorus]
Punch my face, do it 'cause I like the pain
Every time you curse my name
I know you want the satisfaction, it's not gonna happen
Knock me out, kick me when I'm on the ground
It's only gonna let you down
Come the lightning and the thunder
You're the one who'll suffer, suffer

[Verse 1]
She was 19 with a baby on the way
On the EastSide of the city, she was working every day
Cleaning dishes in the evening, she could barely stay awake
She was clinging to the feeling that her luck was gonna change
And 'cross town she would take the bus at night
To a one bedroom apartment, and when she'd turn on the light
She would sit down at the table, tell herself that it's alright
She was waiting on the day she hoped her baby would arrive

[Pre-Chorus]
She'd never be alone
Have someone to hold
And when nights were cold
She'd say

[Chorus]
The world's not perfect, but it's not that bad
If we got each other, and that's all we have
I will be your mother, and I'll hold your hand
You should know I'll be there for you
When the world's not perfect, when the world's not kind
If we have each other then we'll both be fine
I will be your mother, and I'll hold your hand
You should know I'll be there for you

[Verse 2]
They were 90 and were living out their days
On the Westside of the city, next to where they got engaged
They had pictures on the walls of all the memories that they'd made
And though life was never easy, they were thankful that they stayed
With each other, and though some times were hard
Even when she made him angry, he would never break her heart
No, they didn't have the money to afford a fancy car
But they never had to travel 'cause they'd never be apart
Even at the end
Their love was stronger than
The day that they first met
They'd say

[Chorus]
The world's not perfect, but it's not that bad
If we got each other, and that's all we have
I will be your lover, and I'll hold your hand
You should know I'll be there for you
When the world's not perfect, when the world's not kind
If we have each other then we'll both be fine
I will be your lover, and I'll hold your hand
You should know I'll be there for you

[Bridge]
Mmm, mmm, mmm
You should know I'll be there for you

[Verse 3]
I'm 23, and my folks are getting old
I know they don't have forever and I'm scared to be alone
So I'm thankful for my sister, even though sometimes we fight
When high school wasn't easy, she's the reason I survived
I know she'd never leave me, and I hate to see her cry
So I wrote this verse to tell her that I'm always by her side
I wrote this verse to tell her that I'm always by her side
I wrote this verse to tell her that

[Chorus]
The world's not perfect, but it's not that bad
If we got each other, and that's all we have
I will be your brother, and I'll hold your hand
You should know I'll be there for you
When the world's not perfect, when the world's not kind
If we have each other then we'll both be fine
I will be your brother, and I'll hold your hand
You should know I'll be there for you

[Outro]
Mmm, mmm, mmm
You should know I'll be there for you

[Verse 1]
I don't live in California, I'll inform you, that's not where I reside
I'm just atenant,paying rent insidethis body and I
Got two windows,and those windows, well, I call them my eyes
I'm just going where the wind blows, I don't get to decide

[Pre-Chorus]
Sometimes, I think too much, yeah, I get so caught up
I'm always stuck in my head
I wish I could escape, I tried to yesterday
Took all the sheets off my bed

[Chorus]
Then I tied up my linen with five strips of ribbon I found
Scaled the side of the building, I ran to the hills 'til they found me
And they put me back in my cell, all by myself
Alone with my thoughts again
Guess my mind is a prison and I'm never gonna get out

[Verse 2]
So they tranquilized me, analyzed me, threw me back in my cage
Then they tied me to an IV, told me I was insane
I'm a prisoner, a visitor inside of my brain
And no matter what I do, they try to keep me in chains

[Pre-Chorus]
Sometimes, I think too much, yeah, I get so caught up
I'm always stuck in my head
I wish I could escape, I tried to yesterday
Took all the sheets off my bed

[Chorus]
Then I tied up my linen with five strips of ribbon I found
Scaled the side of the building, I ran to the hills 'til they found me
And they put me back in my cell, all by myself
Alone with my thoughts again
Guess my mind is a prison and I'm never gonna get out

[Bridge]
Said even if it's true, no matter what I do
I'm never gonna escape
I won't give up on hope, secure another rope
And try for another day
Said even if it's true, no matter what I do
I'm never gonna escape
I won't give up on hope, secure another rope
And try for another day

[Chorus]
Then I tied up my linen with five strips of ribbon I found
Scaled the side of the building, I ran to the hills 'til they found me
And they put me back in my cell, all by myself
Alone with my thoughts again
Guess my mind is a prison and I'm never gonna get out

[Verse 1]
I'm sorry that I did this
The blood is on my hands
I stare at my reflection
I don't know who I am
Practice my confession
In case I take the stand
I'll say I learned my lesson
I'll be a better man
I'm packing up my things and
I'm wiping down the walls
I'm rinsing off my clothes and
I'm walking through the halls
I did it all for her
So I felt nothing at all
I don't know what she'll say
So I'll ask her when she calls

[Chorus]
Would you love me more 
If I killed someone for you?
Would you hold my hand 
They're the same ones that I used
When I killed someone for you
Would you turn me in 
When they say I'm on the loose?
Would you hide me when 
My face is on the news?
'Cause I killed someone for you

[Verse 2]
I hear the sirens coming
I see the flashing lights
I'm driving through the suburbs
Wearing my disguise
I show up at her doorstep
To look her in the eyes
I tell her that it's me
But she doesn't recognize
Can't you see I'm running?
Said I need a place to hide
I've gotta ask you something
Could you please let me inside?
Just let me explain
No I wouldn't tell you lies
I know you'll understand
If you let me stay the night

[Chorus]
Would you love me more 
If I killed someone for you?
Would you hold my hand 
They're the same ones that I used
When I killed someone for you
Would you turn me in 
When they say I'm on the loose?
Would you hide me when 
My face is on the news?
'Cause I killed someone for you

[Bridge]
You have to understand that
The one I killed is me
Changing what I was
For what you wanted me to be
I followed your direction
Did everything you asked
I hope it makes you happy
'Cause there's just no turning back

[Chorus]
Would you love me more 
If I killed someone for you?
Would you hold my hand 
They're the same ones that I used
When I killed someone for you
Would you turn me in 
When they say I'm on the loose?
Would you hide me when 
My face is on the news?
'Cause I killed someone for you

[Verse 1]
In this masquerade, she can't feel the pain
Cover up her heart, with a little paint
While he's pulling out a flask, to hide it all away
There's nothing left to say

[Pre-Chorus]
He knows that they're drowning
She hopes that there's still something left
Let go now cause he's leaving

[Chorus]
But she'd be fine pretending
Things were alright, even while its ending keep it inside
She can feel them bending
All their love is pending so what is she defending?
Even when she says she'll open her eyes
All her words are empty when she denies
But she can feel them bending
All their love is pending so what is she defending?
But she'd be fine prete  x10 

[Verse 2]
Step into the light, to look him in the eye
Feeling so exposed, she tries to stay composed
But every little fight and every little lie is impossible to hide

[Pre-Chorus]
He knows that there're drowning
She hopes that there's still something left
Let go now cause he's leaving

[Chorus]
But she'd be fine pretending things were alright
Even while its ending keep it inside
She can feel them bending
All their love is pending so what is she defending?
Even when she says she'll open her eyes
All her words are empty when she denies
But she can feel them bending
All their love is pending so what is she defending?
But she'd be fine prete  x10 

[Bridge]
I hate to watch her hurt, I know it isn't right
But she can find the courage to leave it all behind
I wish I had the words to help her realize
That there is just no way to bring this back to life
He knows that they're drowning

[Chorus]
But she'd be fine pretending things were alright
Even while its ending keep it inside
She can feel them bending
All their love is pending, so what is she defending?
Even when she says she'll open her eyes
All the words are empty when she denies
But she can feel them bending all their love is pending so what is
She defending
But she'd be fine prete  x10
She'd be fine

[Verse 1]
A paper crown, and a heart made of glass
A tattered gown, and a kingdom of ash
She walks alone, she can never look back
The story of a queen whose castle has fallen to the sea
She'll make it out, but she's never the same
She's looking down at the scars that remain
But you hold your ground, though your kingdom's in flames

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause it's the story of a queen whose castle has fallen to the sea
Knowing there's no one who will be
A king that will come and save his queen

[Chorus]
When all she needs, when all she wants, when all she finds
When all she is, and ever was is compromised
'Cause there's no one to love you
When you built your walls too high
And there's no one to love you
When you build your walls too high

[Verse 2]
She's looking out from the war that's inside
You're screaming out 'cause no one survived
But when you're all alone, you wait and you hide

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause it's the story of a queen whose castle has fallen to the sea
Knowing there's no one who will be
A king who will come and save his queen

[Chorus]
When all she needs, when all she wants, when all she finds
When all she is, and ever was is compromised
'Cause there's no one to love you
When you built your walls too high
And there's no one to love you
When you build your walls too high

[Bridge]
There's no one who is strong enough to save your love
There's no fairy tale, there's no fairy tale

[Chorus]
All she needs, when all she wants, when all she finds
When all she is, and ever was is compromised
'Cause there's no one to love you
When you built your walls too high
And there's no one to love you
When you trap yourself inside

[Verse 1]
I'm slowly learning
That the things you promised me
Are burning like the embers
Of a thousand willow trees
And every single secret
Has been broadcast like TV
Now all the threads are severed
That were tying you to me

[Pre-Chorus]
I thought we were friends
But now we're enemies
I thought we were friends
But now we're enemies

[Chorus]
Pull your knife out of my back
Your blood runs black
I was just surprised at how you turned on me so fast
I let you in
I held you close
My blood flows like a river 'cause I trusted you the most
And now I know it's over 

[Post-Chorus]
And now I know it's over 
And now I know it's over 
And now I know it's over 

[Verse 2]
I was so naive
I even let you in my home
Took you out for dinner and let you wear my clothes
I can't even breathe
I have your scent still in my nose
It's like I almost miss you
I should have known

[Pre-Chorus]
I thought we were friends
But now we're enemies
I thought we were friends
But now we're enemies

[Chorus]
Pull your knife out of my back
Your blood runs black
I was just surprised at how you turned on me so fast
I let you in
I held you close
My blood flows like a river 'cause I trusted you the most
And now I know it's over 

[Bridge]
And now I know it's over 
And now I know it's over 
And now I know it's over 

[Pre-Chorus]
I thought we were friends
But now we're enemies
I thought we were friends
But now we're enemies

[Chorus]
Pull your knife out of my back
Your blood runs black
I was just surprised at how you turned on me so fast
I let you in
I held you close
My blood flows like a river 'cause I trusted you the most
And now I know it's over 

[Outro]
And now I know it's over 
And now I know it's over 
And now I know it's over 

[Verse 1]
I heard glass shatter on the wall
In the apartment above mine
At first, I thought that I was dreamin'
But then I heard the voice of a girl
And it sounded like shed been cryin'
Now I'm too worried to be sleepin

[Pre-Chorus]
So I took the elevator to the second floor
Walked down the hall and then I knocked upon her door
She opened up, and I asked about the things I've been hearing

[Chorus]
She said, "I think your ears are playing tricks on you"
Sweater zipped up to her chin
"Thanks for caring, sir, that's nice of you
But I have to go back in
Wish I could tell you about the noise
But I didn't hear a thing"
She said, "It must have been the wind, must have been the wind
Must have been the wind, it must have been the wind"
She said, "It must have been the wind, must have been the wind
Must have been the wind, it must have been the wind"

[Verse 2]
So I was layin' on the floor of my room
Cold concrete on my back
No, I just couldn't shake the feeling
I didn't want to intrude 'cause I knew
That I didnt have all the facts
But I couldnt bear the thought of leavin' her

[Pre-Chorus]
So I took the elevator to the second floor
Walked down the hall and then I knocked upon her door
She opened up, and I asked about the things Ive been hearing

[Chorus]
She said, "I think your ears are playing tricks on you"
Sweater zipped up to her chin
"Thanks for caring, sir, that's nice of you
But I have to go back in
Wish I could tell you about the noise
But I didn't hear a thing"
She said, "It must have been the wind, must have been the wind
Must have been the wind, it must have been the wind"
She said, "It must have been the wind, must have been the wind
Must have been the wind, it must have been the wind"

[Bridge]
Aim my boombox at the roof, I'm playing "Lean On Me"
Just so that she knows that she can lean on me
And when she hears the words, I hope she knows shell be okay
Aim my boombox at the roof, I'm playing "Lean On Me"
Just so that she knows that she can lean on me
And when she hears the words, I know exactly what I'll say
"Promise I'm not playing tricks on you
You're always welcome to come in
You could stay here for an hour or two
If you ever need a friend"

[Chorus]
"We can talk about the noise, when you're ready, but 'til then"
I'll say, "It must have been the wind, must have been the wind
Must have been the wind, it must have been the wind"
I'll say, "It must have been the wind, must have been the wind
Must have been the wind, it must have been the wind"

[Verse 1]
Well, I shook hands with the devil
Down on the south side
And he bought us both a drink
With a pad and a pencil, sat by his side
I said, "Tell me what you think"

[Pre-Chorus]
I've been looking for my savior
Looking for my truth
I even asked my shrink
He brought me down to his level
Said, "Son, you're not special
You won't find him where you think

[Chorus]
"You won't find him down on Sunset
Or at a party in the hills
At the bottom of the bottle
Or when you're tripping on some pills
When they sold you the dream, you were just 16
Packed a bag and ran away
And it's a crying shame you came all this way
'Cause you won't find Jesus in LA
And it's a crying shame you came all this way
'Cause you won't find Jesus in LA"

[Verse 2]
Took a sip of his whiskey
Said, "Now that you're with me
Well, I think that you should stay
Yeah, I know you've been busy
Searching through the city
So let me share the way

[Pre-Chorus]
"I know I'm not your savior
Know I'm not your truth
But I think we could be friends"
He said, "Come down to my level
Hang out with the devil
Let me tell you, in the end...

[Chorus]
"You won't find him down on sunset
Or at a party in the hills
At the bottom of the bottle
Or when you're tripping on some pills
When they sold you the dream, you were just 16
Packed a bag and ran away
And it's a crying shame you came all this way
'Cause you won't find Jesus in LA
And it's a crying shame you came all this way
'Cause you won't find Jesus in LA"

[Bridge]
And that is when I knew that it was time to go home
And that is when I realized that I was alone
And all the vibrant colors from the lights fade away
And I don't care what they say

[Chorus]
You won't find him down on sunset
Or at a party in the hills
At the bottom of the bottle
Or when you're tripping on some pills
When they sold you the dream, you were just 16
Packed a bag and ran away
And it's a crying shame you came all this way
'Cause you won't find Jesus in LA
I won't find him down on sunset
Or at a party in the hills
At the bottom of the bottle
Or when I'm tripping on some pills
When they sold me the dream, I was just 16
Packed my bag and ran away
And it's a crying shame I came all this way
'Cause I won't find Jesus in LA
And it's a crying shame I came all this way
'Cause I won't find Jesus in LA

[Verse 1]
Everybody has to get older
Even Jenny
She's just nineteen, young and naive
She wants to find a way to be endless
Fight the science, in defiance, and be timeless

[Pre-Chorus]
Silly little girl who tried to live forever, to live forever
Gave away her soul to buy a bit of pleasure, oh the bitter pleasure
Wicked little boy who tried to steal her treasure, for the bitter pleasure
Now they're cursed forever
Cursed together

[Chorus]
And if you could see
The look in her eyes
The wolf wore the sheep
As a perfect disguise
And she can't believe
That she fell for his lies
He promised forever
But she never knew the price
He promised forever
But she never knew the price
He promised forever
But she never knew the price

[Verse 2]
And as she got a little bit older
Look at Jenny
Now she's ninety
Still looks nineteen
And all she knows to do is surviving
Staying alive and
Now she's crying
'Cause she's not dying

[Pre-Chorus]
Silly little girl who tried to live forever, to live forever
Gave away her soul to buy a bit of pleasure, oh the bitter pleasure
Wicked little boy who tried to steal her treasure, for the bitter pleasure
Now they're cursed forever
Cursed together

[Chorus]
And if you could see
The look in her eyes
The wolf wore the sheep
As a perfect disguise
And she can't believe
That she fell for his lies
He promised forever
But she never knew the price
He promised forever
But she never knew the price
He promised forever
But she never knew the price

[Chorus]
And if you could see
The look in her eyes
The wolf wore the sheep
As a perfect disguise
And she can't believe
That she fell for his lies
He promised forever
But she never knew the price
He promised forever
But she never knew the price
He promised forever
But she never knew the price

[Verse 1]
They say distance is relative
And relative to relatives I have
I'd say I'm relatively close
To breakingdown
Becauseright now
I feelso alone
I've been missing the elementsand
Wishing the elephant in the room
Would leave and kindly close the door
I can't ignore
Him like before
Not anymore

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, I miss you most at six feet apart when you're
Right outside my window, but can't ride inside my car
And it hurts to know just how lovely you are
And be too far away to hold, but close enough to break my heart
I miss your smile
Feels like miles
Six feet apart

[Chorus]
So far, so far, but so close
Like a star out in the cosmos
Can't touch the beauty I see
That's how it feels at six feet

[Verse 2]
Space and time are interwoven
Well, at least that's what we're told
When I was young, I was suspicious, but it's true
Time sticks like glue
I feel so blue
Here missing you
So I think I'll build a time machine and go back to a time
When we didn't need to measure six feet on the ground
When I came around
That's not allowed
I can't go back now

[Pre-Chorus]
So, I miss you most at six feet apart when you're
Right outside my window, but can't ride inside my car
And it hurts to know just how lovely you are
And be too far away to hold, but close enough to break my heart
I miss your smile
Feels like miles
Six feet apart

[Chorus]
So far, so far, but so close
Like a star out in the cosmos
Can't touch the beauty I see
That's how it all feels to me
So far, so far, but so close
Like a star out in the cosmos
Can't touch the beauty I see
That's how it feels at six feet

[Verse 1]
I was in Pittsburgh when I saw Superman in the backroom
He was doing lines or something in the bathroom
I barely recognized him at all
I saw him doing things you shouldn't do with all that power
I wish someone would have thrown him in the shower
I barely recognized him at all

[Chorus]
That night I put my youth in a casket
And buried it inside of me
That night I saw through all the magic
Now I'm a witness to the death of a hero
I burned all the pictures in the attic
And threw away the magazines
That night I saw through all the magic
And now I'm a witness to the death of a hero

[Verse 2]
I tried to look away but you can't look away from a trainwreck
The things you said to girls, well they were shameless
I barely recognized him at all
I tried to help but he said he was just too far from saving
And nothing I could say was gonna change him
I barely recognized him at all

[Chorus]
That night I put my youth in a casket
And buried it inside of me
That night I saw through all the magic
Now I'm a witness to the death of a hero
I burned all the pictures in the attic
And threw away the magazines
That night I saw through all the magic
And now I'm a witness to the death of a hero

[Bridge]
The death of a hero, he couldn't be saved
Now I'm cutting the grass and I'll cover his grave
I'll cover his grave
The death of a hero, I'm turning the page
Now I'm cutting the grass and I'll cover his grave
I'll cover his grave

[Chorus]
That night I put my youth in a casket
And buried it inside of me
That night I saw through all the magic
Now I'm a witness to the death of a hero
I burned all the pictures in the attic
And threw away the magazines
That night I saw through all the magic
And now I'm a witness to the death of a hero

[Verse 1: Alec Benjamin]
This night is cold in the kingdom
I can feel you fade away
From the kitchen to the bathroom sink and
Your steps keep me awake

[Pre-Chorus: Alec Benjamin]
Don't cut me down, throw me out, leave me here to waste
I once was a man with dignity and grace
Now I'm slipping through the cracks of your cold embrace
So please, please

[Chorus: Alec Benjamin]
Could you find a way to let me down slowly?
A little sympathy, I hope you can show me
If you wanna go, then I'll be so lonely
If you're leaving, baby, let me down slowly
Let me down, down, let me down, down, let me down
Let me down, down, let me down, down, let me down
If you wanna go, then I'll be so lonely
If you're leaving, baby let me down slowly

[Verse 2: Alessia Cara]
I hold on to little pieces of what we were
I know we're long gone, but take it easy
Because it hurts

[Pre-Chorus: Alessia Cara]
Don't cut me down, throw me out, leave me here to waste
I once was a girl with dignity and grace
Now I'm slipping through the cracks of your cold embrace
So please, please

[Chorus: Alessia Cara]
Could you find a way to let me down slowly?
A little sympathy, I hope you can show me
If you wanna go, then I'll be so lonely
If you're leaving, baby, let me down slowly
Let me down, down, let me down, down, let me down
Let me down, down, let me down, down, let me down
If you wanna go, then I'll be so lonely
If you're leaving, baby let me down slowly

[Bridge: Alec Benjamin & Alessia Cara]
And I can't stop myself from falling down
And I can't stop myself from falling down
And I can't stop myself from falling down
And I can't stop myself from falling down

[Chorus: Alec Benjamin & Alessia Cara, Alec Benjamin]
Could you find a way to let me down slowly?
A little sympathy, I hope you can show me
If you wanna go, then I'll be so lonely
If you're leaving, baby, let me down slowly
Let me down, down, let me down, down, let me down
Let me down, down, let me down, down, let me down
If you wanna go, then I'll be so lonely
If you're leaving, baby let me down slowly
If you wanna go, then I'll be so lonely
If you're leaving, baby let me down slowly

[Verse 1]
Well my manager rang he said I hate to break the news
But the label called today they said they have to cut you loose
I felt broken like a vase that'd fallen from the roof
Tears rolling down my face lord what am I to do

[Chorus]
I felt pain in my life so far
A fractured wrist and a broken heart
But this is sure to leave a nasty scar, one that might not heal
So I said
This is the worst day of my life
It's the worst, it's the worst day of my life
And I don't know how I'll survive
It's the worst, it's the worst day of my life
I'll admit it's a struggle
Finding light in the tunnel
This is the worst day of my life
It's the worst it's the worst day
Of my life

[Verse 2]
Well I gave up my degree and I moved away from home
I was following my dream now there's nowhere I can go
So I called up my mom and I was bawling on the phone
I was acting like a child but I was all the way grown

[Chorus]
I felt pain in my life so far
A fractured wrist and a broken heart
But this is sure to leave a nasty scar, one that might not heal
So I said
This is the worst day of my life
It's the worst, it's the worst day of my life
And I don't know how I'll survive
It's the worst, it's the worst day of my life
I'll admit it's a struggle
Finding light in the tunnel
This is the worst day of my life
It's the worst it's the worst day
Of my life

[Verse 3]
So I thought to myself that now is time to choose
I can pick myself up or I can give in to the blues
So I swore in my heart that I was never gonna lose
I would crawl until I made it cause I got something to prove

[Chorus]
I felt pain in my life so far
A fractured wrist and a broken heart
But this is sure to leave a nasty scar, one that might not heal
So I said
This is the worst day of my life
It's the worst, it's the worst day of my life
And I don't know how I'll survive
It's the worst, it's the worst day of my life
I'll admit it's a struggle
Finding light in the tunnel
This is the worst day of my life
It's the worst it's the worst day
Of my life

[Verse 1]
I know the Bible isn't perfect
'Cause it left one person out
There was Adam, there was Eve
And there was someone else around
Yeah, I think his name was Steve
And he was passing through town
When he heard a snake a-whispering
To Adam in the garden
"Take the fruit, it's good for you"
Steve said, "I beg your pardon
I know it's not my business
But will you just hear me out"

[Pre-Chorus]
He said, "I wouldn't lie
You should not go to that tree
The serpent knows the apple grows from a forbidden seed
Oh, you want what you can't have
But you've got all the things you need"
There was Adam, there was Eve, and there was Steve

[Chorus]
He said, "Adam, don't be fooled by the snake
Don't risk it all for a taste
Oh, what a waste
To have everything and give it all away"

[Verse 2]
Adam looked around and as he wrestled with his fate
Steve and Eve rolled up their sleeves to wrestle with that snake
In the midst of all the chaos
Steve was still screaming out

[Pre-Chorus]
He said, "I wouldn't lie
You should not go to that tree
The serpent knows the apple grows from a forbidden seed
Oh, you want what you can't have
But you've got all the things you need"
There was Adam, there was Eve, and there was Steve

[Chorus]
He said, "Adam, don't be fooled by the snake
Don't risk it all for a taste
Oh, what a waste
To have everything and give it all away"

[Bridge]
Sometimes I feel like Adam
'Cause I've got more than I need
But even when I have it all
I want what's out of reach
Maybe I should learn my lesson
Like Steve was talkin' to me

[Pre-Chorus]
He said, "I wouldn't lie
You should not go to that tree
The serpent knows the apple grows from a forbidden seed
Oh, you want what you can't have
But you've got all the things you need"
There was Adam, there was Eve, and there was Steve

[Chorus]
He said, "Adam, don't be fooled by the snake
Don't risk it all for a taste
Oh, what a waste
To have everything and give it all away"

[Verse 1]
Careful as I write her name
On the corner of the page
Make it look like it was her, all along
And I put the paper in my bag
As I'm walking back to class
And the notes I wrote
That took me so long

[Pre-Chorus]
She doesn't notice me
She just smiles and says
"Thank you for the trigonometry"
'Cause that's all it meant to her

[Chorus]
But I spent
22 days and 21 nights
Crossing every T, just making it right
Only to discover it's not worth
Doing Annabelle's homework
Doesn't matter how many papers I write
End of the equation won't be you and I
And now I'm just another who got hurt
Doing Annabelle's homework
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Doing Annabelle's homework

[Verse 2]
Careful as I walk away
So she can't see it on my face
How I look and now I'm feeling so bad
I'm disappointed in myself
'Cause I know love's not for sale
Oh, my mother raised me better than that

[Pre-Chorus]
She doesn't notice me
She just smiles and says
"Thank you for the geography"
'Cause that's all it meant to her

[Chorus]
But I spent
22 days and 21 nights
Crossing every T, Just making it right
Only to discover it's not worth
Doing Annabelle's homework
Doesn't matter how many papers I write
End of the equation won't be you and I
And now I'm just another who got hurt
Doing Annabelle's homework
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Doing Annabelle's homework

[Bridge]
I'm alive, you don't know I'm here
Just circling around in your atmosphere, yeah
I'm alive, you don't know I'm here
Just circling around, just circling

[Chorus]
22 days and 21 nights
Crossing every T, just making it right
Only to discover it's not worth
Doing Annabelle's homework
Doesn't matter how many papers I write
End of the equation won't be you and I
And now I'm just another who got hurt
Doing Annabelle's homework
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
And now I'm just another who got hurt
Doing Annabelle's homework

[Chorus]
There's gotta be a reason that I'm here on Earth
Gotta be a reason for the dust and the dirt
The changing of the seasons never changed my hurt
So what's it worth? What's it worth?
Worth another shot of whiskey and another sip of gin
Another drop of poison that is slowly sinking in
If we're going down together, better take another hit
We won't be here forever, so let's make the best of it

[Post-Chorus]
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

[Verse 1]
Walking down to the burial ground
With a sad song in his brain
General Cloud is an old man now
But it feels like yesterday
He was on the front lines, stranded on the beach
Crawling to his best friend, floating in the sea
But he didn't make it, he still can't believe
How arbitrary fate is, he says

[Chorus]
There's gotta be a reason that I'm here on Earth
Gotta be a reason for the dust and the dirt
The changing of the seasons never changed my hurt
So what's it worth? What's it worth?
Worth another shot of whiskey and another sip of gin
Another drop of poison that is slowly sinking in
If we're going down together, better take another hit
We won't be here forever, so let's make the best of it

[Post-Chorus]
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

[Verse 2]
She went down to her job in town
With a sad song in her heart
33 with a wasted dream to become a movie star
Living out a suitcase, serving at a bar
Saving up some pennies, working after dark
Is she gonna make it? She still can't believe
How arbitrary fate is, she says

[Chorus]
There's gotta be a reason that I'm here on Earth
Gotta be a reason for the dust and the dirt
The changing of the seasons never changed my hurt
So what's it worth? What's it worth?
Worth another shot of whiskey and another sip of gin
Another drop of poison that is slowly sinking in
If we're going down together, better take another hit
We won't be here forever, so let's make the best of it

[Post-Chorus]
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

[Chorus]
There's gotta be a reason that I'm here on Earth
Gotta be a reason for the dust and the dirt
The changing of the seasons never changed my hurt
So what's it worth? What's it worth?
Worth another shot of whiskey and another sip of gin
Another drop of poison that is slowly sinking in
If we're going down together, better take another hit
We won't be here forever, so let's make the best of it

[Post-Chorus]
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

[Verse 1]
This is where I broke my wrist, where I thought I could fly
Thinking I was Superman, so you know you can't cry
Because I wanted to be just like them and save my city from crime
I wanted to be just like them, just like them, just like them
Campbell's chicken noodle soup when you stay home from school
Remember watching MTV when there was still music for you
Just a kid on Cholla Street from my city built in the sand
My father said, "You'll be a man, be a man, be a man"

[Chorus]
I was born in 1994
I was born in 1994
And I was, I was born in 1994

[Verse 2]
I guess Santa Claus is just not real and Batman can't fly
And nobody's invincible because I know people die
I saw it on the news one day when the towers fell down
September's not the same place now, same place now, same place now
Now tell me what you wanna be because you grow up too fast
I'll cut my hair and sag my jeans and never show up to class
Get ready 'cause it's time to leave, so pack up your bags
And go be who you wanna be, wanna be, wanna be

[Chorus]
I was born in 1994
I was born in 1994
And I was, I was born in 1994

[Bridge]
My country 'tis of thee, sweet land of liberty
My country 'tis of thee, be who you wanna be
My country 'tis of thee, sweet land of liberty
My country, my country, my country, my

[Chorus]
I was born in 1994
I was born in 1994
And I was, I was born in 1994

[Chorus]
I've got all these demons hiding underneath
Nobody can see them, nobody but me, and you'rethereason
The only thingthat keeps me from diving offthe deep end
Because I've got all these demons, demons, demons, hmm

[Verse 1]
Well, at first I thought I'd have to bear this weight by myself
But when my knees were getting weak and I was in need of help
You were there to take away the pain that I felt, mmh

[Pre-Chorus]
You're the only one that gave me hope
You're the only one who really knows

[Chorus]
I've got all these demons hiding underneath
Nobody can see them, nobody but me, and you're the reason
The only thing that keeps me from diving off the deep end
Because I've got all these demons, demons, demons, hmm

[Verse 2]
For a moment, I thought maybe I was doing alright
So I took your love for granted and I left you behind
I just didn't understand you were what kept me alive, hmm

[Pre-Chorus]
You forgave me, and you gave me hope
Still, you're the only one who really knows

[Chorus]
I've got all these demons hiding underneath
Nobody can see them, nobody but me, and you're the reason
The only thing that keeps me from diving off the deep end
Because I've got all these demons, demons, demons, hmm

[Bridge]
It's you, you pull me through it on the days when I have doubts
Even when I turned my back on you, you never let me down
And even when I hit the bottom, no, you didn't let me drown
Oh, no, no, no, no

[Chorus]
I've got all these demons hiding underneath
Nobody can see them, nobody but me, and you're the reason
The only thingthat keeps me from diving offthe deep end
Because I've got all these demons, demons, demons, hmm
Because I've got all these demons, demons, demons, hmm

[Verse 1]
Looking at the pictures I keep on my shelf
'Cause it's been so long since I'velookedlike myself
Burn anothercandle down
Burn another candle down
Running lowon patience, running now on fumes
I'm never gonna make it halfway to the moon
But it's too late to turn around
But it's too late to turn around

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm running out of oxygen
I'll never be the same again now
Same again now

[Chorus]
Oh my god, I can't remember
Who I was just last December
What have I done, how did I get here?
What have I done?
Oh my god, look in the mirror
I was young, nothing to fear once
What have I done, how did I get here?
What have I done?

[Verse 2]
Maybe I was foolish, I guess I was naive
I didn't know what I had, and I thought I had to leave
I wish that I was homeward bound
I wish that I was homeward bound
I'm searching for a signal, holding out my phone
Have I gone too far, am I on my own?
No one here to hold me now
No one here to hold me now

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm running out of oxygen
Can't help but wish I'd stayed
I'm lost just like Will Robinson
A rocket man in space

[Chorus]
Oh my god, I can't remember
Who I was just last December
What have I done, how did I get here?
What have I done?
Oh my god, look in the mirror
I was young, nothing to fear once
What have I done, how did I get here?
What have I done?

[Post-Chorus]
Mmm, mmm
Mmm, mmm

[Bridge]
Oh my god, I can't remember
Who I was just last December
Who I was just last December
Oh my god

[Chorus]
Oh my god, look in the mirror
I was young, nothing to fear once
What have I done, how did I get here?
What have I done?

[Post-Chorus]
Mmm, mmm
Mmm, mmm

[Verse 1]
Well, it all began in the back of her car
I was just sixteen, but Ifellso hard
Well, theyears went by and she heldmy heart
But her love ran dry and we fell apart

[Pre-Chorus]
I felt her growing distant
I knew her love was shifting
And all that I could say was

[Chorus]
Don't tell me that it's over, the book of you and I
Now you've scribbled out my name
And you've erased my favorite lines
There were so many chapters that we never got to write
Like cereal for dinner and staying up all night
I remember where we started, I remember how you looked
But now I'm missing bits and pieces from the pages that you took
You didn't give a reason, and I'll forever wonder why
We never got to finish the book of you and I

[Verse 2]
Well, I bought a pen and I turned the page
Then I wrote about how I wish you'd stayed
I said all the things that I never got to say
Maybe when it's done I will feel okay

[Pre-Chorus]
But she had grown so distant
And that her love had shifted
I wish she felt the same

[Chorus]
Don't tell me that it's over, the book of you and I
Now you've scribbled out my name
And you've erased my favorite lines
There were so many chapters that we never got to write
Like cereal for dinner and staying up all night
I remember where we started, I remember how you looked
But now I'm missing bits and pieces from the pages that you took
You never gave a reason, and I'll forever wonder why
We never got to finish the book of you and I

[Bridge]
Don't tell me, tell me that you're leaving
My belly hurts and my heart is hardly beating right
I hate to beg but I'll try one last time

[Chorus]
Don't tell me that it's over, the book of you and I
Now you've scribbled out my name
And you've erased my favorite lines
There were so many chapters that we never got to write
Like cereal for dinner and staying up all night
I remember where we started, I remember how you looked
But now I'm missing bits and pieces from the pages that you took
You never gave a reason, and I'll forever wonder why
We never got to finish the book of you and I

[Verse 1]
It's been seventeen days since you left
Twenty hours and thirty minutes
Count the seconds, every breath
And watch the road roll out like ribbon
And maybe she just can't forget
All the miles they have driven
Since the moment that they met

[Pre-Chorus]
He took her heart into his hands
Turned into ashes, slipped through his fingers
It tore him apart and he couldn't stand
Watching the magic turn into cinders

[Chorus]
So when you pull away
Don't let the memories blind you
All of the things you chase
Falling away behind you
It's something you can't replace
Chained to the love that binds you
Don't let the past remind you
She's the last of her kind
The last of her kind
The last of her kind

[Verse 2]
It's been twenty-three days since they spoke
And he almost sent a postcard
In every sentence that he wrote
Etched like tombstones on a grave yard
And maybe he just can't accept
All the strings that needed changing
The mistakes that he was making

[Pre-Chorus]
He took her heart 
Into his hands 
Turned into ashes, slipped through his fingers
It tore him apart 
And he couldn't stand 
Watching the magic turn into cinders

[Chorus]
So when you pull away
Don't let the memories blind you
All of the things you chase
Falling away behind you
It's something you can't replace
Chained to the love that binds you
Don't let the past remind you
She's the last of her kind
The last of her kind

[Pre-Chorus]
He took her heart into his hands
Turned into ashes, slipped through his fingers
It tore him apart and he couldn't stand
Watching the magic turn into cinders

[Chorus]
So when you pull away
Don't let the memories blind you
All of the things you chase
Falling away behind you
It's something you can't replace
Chained to the love that binds you
Don't let the past remind you
She's the last of her kind
The last of her kind
The last of her kind

[Verse 1]
I've been falling much more deep than I wanna
Ive been wishing I could breathe underwater
I hold my breath
I can't see what comes next
I don't know when
Ill see dry land again

[Chorus]
Another 40 days, I'm lost at sea
I'm just gonna swim until you love me
Hopin' that your heart will rescue me
I'm just gonna swim until you love me
Swim until you love me
Swim, swim, swim
Swim until you love me
Swim, swim, swim

[Verse 2]
I've been drowning in these sheets, feeling lonely
Wishing you were here with me, every morning
Over my head
The tide comes rolling in
I don't know when
I'll see dry land again

[Chorus]
Another 40 days, Im lost at sea
Im just gonna swim until you love me
Hopin' that your heart will rescue me
Im just gonna swim until you love me
Swim until you love me
Swim, swim, swim
Swim until you love me
Swim, swim, swim

[Bridge]
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
I will never get over you

[Chorus]
Another 40 days, I'm lost at sea
I'm just gonna swim until you love me
Hopin' that your heart will rescue me 
Im just gonna swim until you love me 
Swim until you love me 
Swim, swim, swim 
Swim until you love me 
Swim, swim, swim 

[Outro]
I will never get over you

[Chorus]
My tea's gone cold
I'm wondering why I got out of bed at all
The morning rain cloud touched my window
And I can't see at all
And even if I could it would all be gray
I put your picture on my wall
It reminds me that it's not so bad, it's not so bad

[Verse 1]
Dear Slim, I wrote you, but you still ain't callin'
I left my cell, my pager and my home phone at the bottom
I sent two letters back in autumn, you must not've got 'em
There probably was a problem at the post office or somethin'
Sometimes I scribble addresses too sloppy when I jot 'em
But anyways, fuck it, what's been up, man? How's your daughter?
My girlfriend's pregnant too, I'm 'bout to be a father
If I have a daughter, guess what I'ma call her?
I'ma name her Bonnie
I read about your Uncle Ronnie too, I'm sorry
I had a friend kill himself over some bitch who didn't want him
I know you probably hear this every day, but I'm your biggest fan
I even got the underground shit that you did with Skam
I got a room full of your posters and your pictures, man
I like the shit you did with Rawkus too, that shit was phat
Anyways, I hope you get this, man, hit me back
Just to chat, truly yours, your biggest fan, this is Stan

[Chorus]
My tea's gone cold
I'm wondering why I got out of bed at all
The morning rain cloud touched my window
And I can't see at all
And even if I could it would all be gray
I put your picture on my wall
It reminds me that it's not so bad, it's not so bad

[Verse 2]
Dear Slim, you still ain't called or wrote, hope you have a chance
I ain't mad, I just think it's fucked up you don't answer fans
If you don't wanna to talk to me outside your concert
You didn't have to
But you coulda signed an autograph for Matthew
That's my little brother, man, he's only six years old
We waited in the blisterin' cold
For you, for four hours, and you just said, "No"
That's pretty shitty, man, you're like his fuckin' idol
He wants to be just like you, man, he likes you more than I do
I ain't that mad, though I just don't like being lied to
Remember when we met in Denver?
You said if I'd write you, you would write back
See, I'm just like you in a way: I never knew my father neither
He used to always cheat on my mom and beat her
I can relate to what you're sayin' in your songs
So when I have a shitty day, I drift away and put 'em on
Cause I don't really got shit else
So that shit helps when I'm depressed
I even got a tattoo of your name across the chest
Sometimes I even cut myself to see how much it bleeds
It's like adrenaline, the pain is such a sudden rush for me
See, everything you say is real, and I respect you cause you tell it
My girlfriend's jealous 'cause I talk about you 24/7
But she don't know you like I know you, Slim, no one does
She don't know what it was like for people like us growin' up
You gotta call me, man
I'll be the biggest fan you'll ever lose, sincerely yours, Stan
P.S.: We should be together too

[Chorus]
My tea's gone cold
I'm wondering why I got out of bed at all
The morning rain cloud touched my window
And I can't see at all
And even if I could it would all be gray
I put your picture on my wall
It reminds me that it's not so bad, it's not so bad

[Outro]
And the story isn't over, but I have to tell the truth
I know I couldn't do it justice, only one who could is you
Because I idolized you Marshall, and nobody understands
Maybe I'm a little crazy, maybe I am just like Stan, damn

[Verse 1]
I can't believe you love me
After all the things I've done
I think I've been the devil
Since the day that I turned one
Like when I stole your money
Just to buy a pack of gum
I know it wasn't funny
Can't believe I was so dumb

[Pre-Chorus]
I blame it on my age
But even now, I'm not so young
I'm still stuck in my ways
I can't believe what I've become
Somehow, you feel the same
I guess that's motherly love
Motherly love
Wish I could find the piece in me
To see the good things that you see
It's not that easy

[Chorus]
But if I saw me through your eyes
Maybe I could find a way
To forgive all of the lies
And the stupid things I say
And if I could realize
That it's your blood that I bleed
Maybe I could love myself
Like the way that you love me
If I saw me through your eyes
Your eyes
Through your eyes
Through my mother's eyes

[Verse 2]
I can't believe you love me
After all the things I did
Like when I said I hated you when we were in Madrid
Like when I didn't answer you cause I was on the road
But you cooked my favorite dinner for me right when I get home

[Pre-Chorus]
I blame it on my stress
Cause I've been feeling so high strung
I'm looking for excuses
And I know that isn't one
Somehow, you feel the same
I guess that's motherly love
Motherly love
Wish I could find the piece in me
To see the good things that you see
It's not that easy

[Chorus]
But if I saw me through your eyes
Maybe I could find a way
To forgive all of the lies
And the stupid things I say
And if I could realize
That it's your blood that I bleed
Maybe I could love myself
Like the way that you love me

[Outro]
If I saw me through your eyes
Your eyes
Through your eyes
Through my mother's eyes
Through my mother's eyes
Through my mother's eyes
Through my mother's eyes
But if I saw me through your eyes
Maybe I could find a way
To forgive all of the lies
And the stupid things I say
And if I could realize
That it's your blood that I bleed
Maybe I could love myself
Like the way that you love me
If I saw me through your eyes
Your eyes
Through your eyes
Through my mother's eyes

[Verse 1]
When I was fifteen in my parents house
I met a good girl when school got out
And I was too scared to tell her how I loved her still
Well I loved her still, I loved her still, I loved her still
Well we grew up and we both moved out
We went to different schools in different towns
And is it too late to tell you now I love you still?
Well I love you still, I love you still, I love you still

[Chorus]
Mistakes I made when I was younger, and it's too late to discover
Love at the end of the summer, at the end of the summer
And there are times that I wonder is it too late to discover
Love at the end of the summer, at the end of the summer?
Summer, summer

[Verse 2]
Well I think back every now and then
So I can sit back and just pretend
That when you call me, I will tell you how I feel
And I never will, I never will, I love you still
I love you still, I love you still, I love you still

[Chorus]
Mistakes I made when I was younger, and it's too late to discover
Love at the end of the summer, at the end of the summer
And there are times that I wonder is it too late to discover
Love at the end of the summer, at the end of the summer?
Summer, summer

[Bridge]
And every night before I sleep
I like to think you think of me
And every night before I sleep
I like to think you think of
I think that we should think of
And do you ever think of

[Chorus]
Mistakes I made when I was younger, and it's too late to discover
Love at the end of the summer, at the end of the summer?
And there are times that I wonder is it too late to discover
Love at the end of the summer, at the end of the summer?
Mistakes I made when I was younger, and it's too late to discover
Love at the end of the summer, at the end of the summer?
And there are times that I wonder is it too late to discover
Love at the end of the summer, at the end of the summer?

[Outro]
Summer
Summer

[Verse 1]
I know this is coming to an end
Aware of all the pain that will ensue
And when it leaves a hole inside my chest
I'm not sure how I'll cover up the wound

[Pre-Chorus]
My body's filled with my regret
And sorrow
Gloomy symphonies fill my head, mhh

[Chorus]
Tonight I think I'll write the saddest song
To cleanse me of your memory and mend me when you're gone
I can feel we're barely holding on
So tonight I think I'll write the saddest song
And maybe when I play it in my room
I won't feel so empty when I'm thinking about you
I can feel we're barely holding on
So tonight I think I'll write the saddest song
Mhh-mh, mhh, Mhh-mh

[Verse 2]
Maybe you'll be on your way to work
And hear it when you're driving down the street
And maybe then you'll wanna make things work
And tell me that you never wanna leave

[Pre-Chorus]
My body's filled with my regret
And sorrow
Gloomy symphonies fill my head, mhh

[Chorus]
Tonight I think I'll write the saddest song
To cleanse me of your memory and mend me when you're gone
I can feel we're barely holding on
So tonight I think I'll write the saddest song
And maybe when I play it in my room
I won't feel so empty when I'm thinking about you
I know that we're barely holding on
So tonight I think I'll write the saddest song
Mhh-mh, mhh, Mhh-mh
Mhh-mh, mhh, Mhh-mh

[Verse 1]
Gabriel the oldest son
He praised the Lord and married young
Became a priest and at confession
Cured the people of transgression
Gabriel he held the weight
Of everybody's toxic waste
And with a load upon his shoulder
Couldn't sleep as he got older

[Chorus]
Oh oh oh
What it means to be someone
That everybody has to talk to
Everybody has to talk to
Oh oh oh
Our Gabriel he had no one
That he could talk to
Gabriel he had no one
That he could talk to

[Verse 2]
Looking for a place to be
Or some place he could hide his grief
Gabriel ran to the beach
And set out for the open sea
Heaved the baggage from the sand
Aboard the vessel with his hands
And when he couldn't see the land
Released their sins on his command

[Chorus]
Oh oh oh
What it means to be someone
That everybody has to talk to
Everybody has to talk to
Oh oh oh
Our Gabriel he had no one
That he could talk to
Gabriel he had no one
That he could talk to

[Verse 3]
As the problems slowly drifted
All the weight was quickly lifted
From his bag into the sea
He finally felt he was free
When he got home after months
Sat down and waited for lunch
He looked down at an empty dish
Cause all their sins had killed the fish

[Chorus]
Oh oh oh
What it means to be someone
That everybody has to talk to
Everybody has to talk to
Oh oh oh
Our Gabriel he had no one
That he could talk to
Gabriel he had no one
That he could talk to

[Outro]
But is Gabriel responsible

[Verse 1]
If you gave me only one wish
I wouldn't want to feel this way
They told me I'd have your memory
But all I want is you to stay
And I can't stop my mind from haunting me
It's like a scar on a butterfly's wing
I wanted you to know

[Chorus]
This beautiful pain that I feel is all because of you
And one day these bones will heal
And they'll leave me with the truth
And I'll give you everything if it's the last thing that I do
This beautiful pain, this beautiful pain
This beautiful pain for you

[Verse 2]
If I sailed the world on stormy seas
Chasing sunlight that I can't see
I was a dreamer here before
Before I woke up and fell to the floor
And I'd climb to heaven if I could find you
Even with a scar this butterfly flew
I wanted you to know

[Chorus]
This beautiful pain that I feel is all because of you
And one day these bones will heal
And they'll leave me with the truth
And I'll give you everything if it's the last thing that I do
This beautiful pain, this beautiful pain, this beautiful pain

[Bridge]
And all I'll ever need
And all I'll ever be
Within every part of me

[Chorus]
Is this, this beautiful pain that I feel is all because of you
And one day these bones will heal
And leave me with the truth
And I'll give you everything 'cause it was all I ever knew
This beautiful pain, this beautiful pain, this beautiful pain for you

[Verse 1]
I like it that youre calling
Everytime you need something from me 
I know you think Im falling
For all these tricks youre hiding up your sleeve 

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Pull the rabbit from your hat
Anything just to distract from the motives that you dont know I can see
Pull the wool over my eyes
You dont know what you hide is providing me with everything I need

[Pre-Chorus 2]
I know that you are using me
Ill just keep it to myself
Cause I know if I dont then youll just use somebody else
I like it when youre using me
So I keep it to myself
Cause I know if I dont
Then youll just use somebody else

[Chorus]
Use me
Use me
Use me
Dont use somebody else
Use me
Use me
Use me
Dont use somebody else

[Verse 2]
I know that its so easy to get me to do anything you ask 
I know that you dont need me
But you know that I will keep on coming back 

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Pull the rabbit from your hat
Anything just to distract from the motives that you dont know I can see
Pull the wool over my eyes
You dont know what you hide is providing me with everything I need

[Pre-Chorus 2]
I know that you are using me
Ill just keep it to myself
Cause I know if I dont then youll just use somebody else
I like it when youre using me
So I keep it to myself
Cause I know if I dont
Then youll just use somebody else

[Chorus]
Use me
Use me
Use me
Dont use somebody else
Use me
Use me
Use me
Dont use somebody else

[Verse 1]
She was soft, she was kind
She was warm and she was mine
And now she's getting married
Now she's getting married
And I'm not the one she'll kiss goodnight

[Verse 2]
We were young, I'll admit
But I thought that this was it
And now she's getting married
All my hope is buried
And I wonder if she ever thinks of
Ice cream in the park, dancing in dark
And holding like she'd never let me go

[Verse 3]
She'll dress up wearing white while I wait for a wife
And now she's getting carried from the sanctuary
And they're driving down the streets were we once
Held each others hands, talked about our plans
And dreamed about the places we would go

[Bridge]
Do you ever think, do you ever think
Do you ever think of me?
Do you ever dream, do you ever dream
That we were meant to be?
Do you ever think, do you ever think
Do you ever think of me?
Do you ever dream, do you ever dream
That we were meant to be?

[Outro]
So if I, had the chance, I would ask for one last dance
I know we're not together, I'll love her forever
Even when I'm buried, now she's getting married

[Verse 1]
I wish I could spin, turn back the clock, begin again
And I wish I were him, holding your hand, kissing your lips

[Pre Chorus]
I don't want to know what I know
I want you more than you know

[Chorus]
I envy the sun, you catch the rays
Envy the love that you embrace
Envy the one I can't replace, oh I envy
Envy the hands touching your face
Envy the arms around your waist
Envy the man taking my place, oh I envy
I envy him, I envy him, I envy him

[Verse 2]
You looked at my heart
Then walked away and left it behind
You went on your way, leaving me here, out of my mind

[Pre Chorus]
I don't want to know what I know
I want you more than you know

[Chorus]
I envy the sun, you catch the rays
Envy the love that you embrace
Envy the one I can't replace, oh I envy
Envy the hands touching your face
Envy the arms around your waist
Envy the man taking my place, oh I envy
I envy him, I envy him, I envy him

[Verse 1]
She surrounds me, my God, she astounds me
And everything she does will make me weak
Take my heart now, go ahead and break my heart down
Be careful with the words you choose to speak

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause it's Judgement Day, and she's a little bit angry
Might get a little bit reckless with my heart
It's too much these days
She says she really wants to love me
But then again she might kill me
'Cause that's who we are

[Chorus]
It's hard to understand
This relationship is a burning garden
Break my heart like kindergarten
I hate you, then I'll beg your pardon
I love you now lets plant a garden

[Verse 2]
Give me fire, my girl, she's a liar
She told me she was at her friend's last week
She was with him, I know that she was with him
And when I think about it, I can't sleep

[Pre-Chorus]
Now it's Judgement Day, and I'm a little bit angry
Might get a little bit reckless with her heart
It's too much these days
Oh, I really want to leave her
But then again I still need her
It tears me apart

[Chorus]
It's hard to understand
This relationship is a burning garden
Break my heart like kindergarten
I hate you, then I'll beg your pardon
I love you now lets plant a garden

[Bridge]
We burn a beautiful flame
We burn a beautiful flame
We burn a beautiful flame
We burn a beautiful flame
We burn a beautiful flame
We burn a beautiful flame
We burn a beautiful flame

[Chorus/Outro]
It's hard to understand
This relationship is a burning garden
Break my heart like kindergarten
It's hard to understand
This relationship is a burning garden
Break my heart like kindergarten
I hate you, then I'll beg your pardon
I love you now lets plant a garden
I hate you now I'm breathing carbon
Our love is like a burning garden

[Verse 1]
Turn the TV on when I lay in bed
Try to drown the noise pounding in my head
'Cause I can't let go of the things we said

[Pre-Chorus]
Now when I, I've been talking in my sleep
And I ain't heard from you in weeks
I thought I had your heart for keeps

[Chorus]
Please give me more anesthesia
You left me right when I need ya
Sometimes at night I can feel ya
Under the knife, the blinding light
And I need ya
And I, and I, and I need ya
And I, and I, and I need ya
And I, and I, and I need ya
And I need ya, anesthesia

[Verse 2]
Now it's 2:00 a.m. and I'm wide awake
And I need a fix just to numb the pain
Never felt so sick since you went away

[Pre-Chorus]
Now when I, I've been talking in my sleep
And I ain't heard from you in weeks
I thought I had your heart for keeps

[Chorus]
Please give me more anesthesia
You left me right when I need ya
Sometimes at night I can feel ya
Under the knife, the blinding light
And I need ya
And I, and I, and I need ya
And I, and I, and I need ya
And I, and I, and I need ya
And I need ya, anesthesia

[Verse 1]
He set out with a backpack
A compass in hand
To steal Mona Lisa
And that was his plan
A modern day outlaw
He'll take what he can
And vanish before you
Like tracks in the sand

[Pre-Chorus]
His pockets were full but his heart was so heavy
And all these material things can be deadly if
No one is there who will share when you're seventy-one

[Chorus]
If only someone
Filled the spaces
He might settle down

[Verse 2]
He met her on Tuesday
On his way back from France
He rolled up the painting
He stole with his hands
And even Da Vinci
Couldn't have sketched
A more perfect woman
Than the one that he met

[Pre-Chorus]
His pockets were full but his heart was so heavy
And all these material things can be deadly if
No one is there who will share when you're seventy-one

[Chorus]
If only someone
Filled the spaces
He might settle down

[Bridge]
Settle down, settle down, settle down, settle down

[Verse 3]
He woke up in the morning
With nothing around
She left with the portrait
No trace of her found
She was the outlaw
She was the one
She took the bounty
And left him with none

[Pre-Chorus]
His pockets aren't full and his heart is still empty
And falling in love, it can be just as deadly
And no one is there who will care when he's seventy-one

[Chorus]
If only someone
Filled the spaces
He might settle down

[Outro]
Settle down

[Chorus]
Tryna get to the bottom
Tryna get to your heart
But I don't, but I don't
But Idon'tknow where tostart
At the bottom
But I've been keptin the dark
And I don't, and I don't know where to start
No matter what I find
I'll never leave your side
Even at the bottom
I'm tryna get to the bottom

[Verse 1]
Tell me, is it something that I said?
I made you turn the other way in bed
In this bed
You've been whispering words under your breath
Wish I knew the thoughts inside your head
In your head

[Pre-Chorus]
You're distant when you're hungry
Smile when you're sad
I can read it on your body
When you're mad and you don't wanna talk it over
But this just isn't that

[Chorus]
I'm tryna get to the bottom
Tryna get to your heart
But I don't, But I don't
But I don't know where to start
At the bottom
But I've been kept in the dark
And I don't, and I don't know where to start
No matter what I find
I'll never leave your side
Even at the bottom
I'm tryna get to the bottom

[Verse 2]
Tell me, do you wanna make this work?
Do you wanna sit there in this hurt?
In this hurt?
I'll know if you lend me, I can help
I really want to fix this, can't you tell

[Pre-Chorus]
You're distant when you're hungry
Smile when you're sad
I can read it on your body
When you're mad and you don't wanna talk it over
But this just isn't that

[Chorus]
I'm tryna get to the bottom
Tryna get to your heart
But I don't, But I don't
But I don't know where to start
At the bottom
But I've been kept in the dark
And I don't, and I don't know where to start
And no matter what I find
I'll never leave your side
Even at the bottom
I'm tryna get to the bottom

[Verse 1]
I never came to the beach or stood by the ocean
I never sat by the shore under the sun with my feet in the sand
But you brought me here, and I'm happy that you did
'Cause now I'm as free, as birds catchin' the wind
I always thought I would sink, so I never swam
I never went boatin', don't get how they are floatin'
And sometimes I get so scared of what I can't understand

[Chorus]
But here I am, next to you
The sky's more blue in Malibu
Next to you in Malibu
Next to you

[Verse 2]
We watched the sun go down as we were walkin'
I'd spent the rest of my life just standing here talkin'
You would explain the current, as I just smile
Hoping that you'll stay the same and nothing will change
And it'll be us, just for a while
Do they even exist?
That's when I make a wish, to swim away with the fish
Cause it's supposed to be this hot all summer long
I never would've believed you if three years ago you told me
I'd be here writing this song

[Chorus]
But here I am, next to you
The sky's so blue in Malibu
Next to you in Malibu
Next to you
Next to you
The sky's so blue in Malibu
Next to you

[Outro]
We are just like the waves that flow back and forth
Sometimes I feel like I'm drowning
And you're there to save me
And I wanna thank you with all of my heart
It's a brand new start
A dream come true in Malibu

[Verse 1]
We clawed, we chained, our hearts in vain
We jumped, never asking why
We kissed, I fell under your spell
A love no one could deny

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't you ever say I just walked away
I will always want you
I can't live a lie, running for my life
I will always want you

[Chorus]
I came in like a wrecking ball
I never hit so hard in love
All I wanted was to break your walls
All you ever did was wreck me
Yeah, you, you wreck me

[Verse 2]
I put you high up in the sky
And now, you're not coming down
It slowly turned, you let me burn
And now, we're ashes on the ground

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't you ever say I just walked away
I will always want you
I can't live a lie, running for my life
I will always want you

[Chorus]
I came in like a wrecking ball
I never hit so hard in love
All I wanted was to break your walls
All you ever did was wreck me
I came in like a wrecking ball
Yeah, I just closed my eyes and swung
Left me crashing in a blazing fall
All you ever did was wreck me
Yeah, you, you wreck me

[Bridge]
I never meant to start a war
I just wanted you to let me in
And instead of using force
I guess I should've let you win
I never meant to start a war
I just wanted you to let me in
I guess I should've let you win

[Interlude]
Don't you ever say I just walked away
I will always want you

[Chorus]
I came in like a wrecking ball
I never hit so hard in love
All I wanted was to break your walls
All you ever did was wreck me
I came in like a wrecking ball
Yeah, I just closed my eyes and swung
Left me crashing in a blazing fall
All you ever did was wreck me
Yeah, you, you wreck me
Yeah, you, you wreck me

Once upon a time, it was paradise
Once upon a time, I was paralyzed
Think I'm gonna miss these harbor lights
But it's time to let it go
Once upon a time, it was made for us
Woke up one day, it had turned to dust
Baby, we were found, but now we're lost
So it's time to let it go

[Pre-Chorus]
I want my house in the hills
Don't want the whiskey and pills
I don't give up easily
But I don't think I'm down

[Chorus]
So won't you slide away?
Back to the ocean, I'll go back to the city lights
So won't you slide away?
Back to the ocean, la-la-la, you'll slide away
So won't you slide away?
Back to the ocean, I'll go back to the city lights
So won't you slide away?
Back to the ocean, la-la-la, you'll slide away

Once upon a time, it was paradise
Once upon a time, I was paralyzed
Think I'm gonna miss these harbor lights
But it's time to let it go

Woke up one day, it had turned to dust
Baby, we were found, but now we're lost
So it's time to let it go

[Pre-Chorus]
Move on, we're not seventeen

Must be something in the water or that I'm my mother's daughter

Baby, baby, yeah, are you listening?
Wondering where you've been all my life
I just started living
Ooh-oh, baby, are you listening?
Oh-oh

[Chorus]
When you say you love me
Know I love you more
And when you say you need me
Know I need you more
Boy, I adore you
I adore you

[Verse 2]
Baby, can you hear me
When I'm crying out for you?
I'm scared, oh, so scared
But when you're near me
I feel like I'm standing with an army
Of men armed with weapons

[Chorus]
When you say you love me
Know I love you more
And when you say you need me
Know I need you more
Boy, I adore you
I adore you

[Bridge]
I love lying next to you
I could do this for eternity, you and me
We're meant to be in holy matrimony
God knew exactly what He was doing
When He led me to you

[Chorus]
When you say you love me
Know I love you more 
And when you say you need me
Know I need you more
Boy, I adore you
I adore you

[Verse 1]
I hopped off the plane at LAX
With a dream and my cardigan
Welcome to the land of fame excess 
Am I gonna fit in?
Jumped in the cab, here I am for the first time
Look to my right, and I see the Hollywood sign
This is all so crazy
Everybody seems so famous

[Pre-Chorus]
My tummy's turnin' and I'm feelin' kinda homesick
Too much pressure and I'm nervous
That's when the taxi man turned on the radio
And a JAY-Z song was on
And a JAY-Z song was on
And a JAY-Z song was on

[Chorus]
So I put my hands up
They're playin' my song, the butterflies fly away
I'm noddin' my head like, yeah
Movin' my hips like, yeah
Got my hands up, they're playing my song
They know I'm gonna be okay
Yeah, it's a party in the U.S.A.
Yeah, it's a party in the U.S.A.

[Verse 2]
Get to the club in my taxi cab
Everybody's lookin' at me now
Like, "Who's that chick that's rockin' kicks?
She gotta be from out of town"
So hard with my girls not around me
It's definitely not a Nashville party
'Cause all I see are stilettos
I guess I never got the memo

[Pre-Chorus]
My tummy's turnin' and I'm feelin' kinda homesick
Too much pressure and I'm nervous
That's when the DJ dropped my favorite tune
And a Britney song was on
And a Britney song was on
And a Britney song was on

[Chorus]
So I put my hands up
They're playin' my song, the butterflies fly away
I'm noddin' my head like, yeah
Movin' my hips like, yeah
Got my hands up, they're playing my song
They know I'm gonna be okay
Yeah, it's a party in the U.S.A.
Yeah, it's a party in the U.S.A.

[Bridge]
Feel like hopping on a flight 
Back to my hometown tonight 
Something stops me every time 
The DJ plays my song and I feel alright

[Chorus]
So I put my hands up
They're playing my song, the butterflies fly away
I'm noddin' my head like, yeah 
Movin' my hips like, yeah 
Got my hands up, they're playing my song
They know I'm gonna be okay 
Yeah, it's a party in the U.S.A.
Yeah, it's a party in the U.S.A.
So I put my hands up
They're playing my song, the butterflies fly away 
I'm noddin' my head like, 'yeah' 
Movin' my hips like, 'yeah' 
Got my hands up, they're playing my song
They know I'm gonna be okay 
Yeah , it's a party in the U.S.A.
Yeah , it's a party in the U.S.A.

[Verse 1]
I can almost see it
That dream I'm dreaming, but
There's a voice inside my head saying
"You'll never reach it"
Every step I'm taking
Every move I make feels lost, with no direction
My faith is shaken

[Pre-Chorus 1]
But I, I gotta keep trying
Gotta keep my head held high

[Chorus]
There's always gonna be another mountain
I'm always gonna wanna make it move
Always gonna be an uphill battle
Sometimes I'm gonna have to lose
Aint about how fast I get there
Aint about what's waiting on the other side
It's the climb

[Verse 2]
The struggles I'm facing
The chances I'm taking
Sometimes might knock me down, but
No, I'm not breaking
I may not know it
But these are the moments that I'm gonna remember most, yeah
Just gotta keep going

[Pre-Chorus 2]
And I, I gotta be strong
Just keep pushing on, 'cause...

[Chorus]
There's always gonna be another mountain
I'm always gonna wanna make it move
Always gonna be an uphill battle
Sometimes I'm gonna have to lose
Aint about how fast I get there
Aint about what's waiting on the other side
It's the climb

[Instrumental Bridge]

[Chorus]
There's always gonna be another mountain
I'm always gonna wanna make it move
Always gonna be an uphill battle
Sometimes you're gonna have to lose
Aint about how fast I get there
Aint about what's waiting on the other side
It's the climb

[Outro]
Keep on moving
Keep climbing
Keep the faith, baby
It's all about, it's all about the climb
Keep your faith, keep your faith
Woah-u-oh

[Intro: Miley Cyrus]
Oh, you broke my heart
I told you I was weak for love
But then you went around
And did what you wanted to do
And now I'm cryin', cryin'

[Verse 1: Miley Cyrus]
Ooh, it seemed like everything was going fine
I found the love that I thought was gonna last
But then I accidentally saw a few things in your cell
I even LOL'd
Man, I should've known
Why? Why you're doing what you do?
You, you might as well just tell the honest truth
See, I'm not really down with this
This ain't no texting shit
No, I ain't got no biz, but it is what it is

[Pre-Chorus: Miley Cyrus]
I don't really have much to say
I was over it the second that I saw her name

[Chorus: Miley Cyrus]
I got two, ooh-ooh, letters for you
One of them's "F" and the other one's "U"
'Cause what you gotta do is go get yourself a clue
Only two, ooh-ooh, letters to choose
One of them's "F" and the other one's "U"
SMH
I'm pressing "send" on you

[Verse 2: French Montana]
Could've been this, could've been that
We done been there, we done been back
You ain't with it, could've said that
Why you tripping?
Let me hit that
I ain't trying to argue no more
I do it all for you
You know you're my ride or die, baby, let me show you

[Verse 3: Miley Cyrus]
Oh, I know what's been goin' on
Don't even try to act like Mr. Super Nonchalant
What makes you think I'll stick around?
I'm not as stupid as you sound
And you sound really dumb right now
From A to Zed, ooh-ah
I got a lot of nasty things floating up in my head
But none of them are worth my time
You're not even worth this rhyme
And I don't, I don't give a flying

[Pre-Chorus: Miley Cyrus]
I don't really have much to say
I was over it the second that I saw her name

[Chorus: Miley Cyrus]
I got two, ooh-ooh, letters for you
One of them's "F" and the other one's "U"
'Cause what you gotta do is go get yourself a clue
Only two, ooh-ooh, letters to choose
One of them's "F" and the other one's "U"
SMH
I'm pressing "send" on you

[Bridge: French Montana & ]
 Letters for you
What you trippin' on?
Girl, you know you wrong
Don't let these girls drive you crazy, haan

[Pre-Chorus: Miley Cyrus]
I don't really have much to say
I was over it the second that I saw her name

[Chorus: Miley Cyrus]
I got two, ooh-ooh, letters for you
One of them's "F" and the other one's "U"
'Cause what you gotta do is go get yourself a clue
Only two, ooh-ooh, letters to choose
One of them's "F" and the other one's "U"
SMH
I'm pressing "send" on you

[Verse 1: Miley Cyrus]
You're in my bed uninvited
It's fine 'cause I'm in the mood
Hope you don't mind if I spike it
We'll drink it, just me and you

[Pre-Chorus: Miley Cyrus]
And you know we're gonna be alright
We'll be sleeping on a red-eye flight
Keep up with me 'til the end of the night
And we're just gettin' started

[Chorus: Miley Cyrus]
Always last to leave the party
Drugs rule everything around me
Wake up with new tattoos on my body
Drugs rule everything around me
Hit the Goose, raise a toast, pop the molly
I can go toe-to-toe, like I'm Ali
We're all tryna fill the lonely
Drugs rule everything around me

[Post-Chorus: Miley Cyrus]
Drugs rule everything around me
Drugs rule everything around me

[Verse 2: Miley Cyrus]
These planes are all UFOs
And this city's in outer space
It's better than where we came from
I think that we both should stay

[Pre-Chorus: Miley Cyrus]
'Cause you know we're gonna be alright
We'll be fucking on a red-eye flight
Keep up with me 'til the end of the night
And we're just gettin' started

[Chorus: Miley Cyrus]
Always last to leave the party
Drugs rule everything around me
Wake up with new tattoos on my body
Drugs rule everything around me
Hit the ghost, raise a toast, pop the molly
All the girls in my room look like Dolly
We're all tryna fill the lonely
Drugs rule everything around me

[Post-Chorus: Miley Cyrus]

Drugs rule everything around me
Drugs rule everything around me
Drugs rule everything around me
Drugs rule everything around me

[Outro: Ghostface Killah]
Drugs rule everything around me
You could call me a king
I got it all in my store, you should crown me
Purple Perc, sticky green mollies, sippy lean
Got the white that's sure to light the floor like in "Billie Jean"
Scarface nights 
500 thousand on the pinkie, Broadway ice 
We throw diamonds at weddings and y'all throw rice 
Lollapalooza, Coachella custies, that's my type
Party all night

[Intro: RuPaul]
Miley Cyrus
Bitch, you look like you done already done had yours
You better go take your country-ass indoors
And put some damn clothes on
'Cause don't nobody need to be seeing all of that
The library is officially open

[Verse 1: RuPaul]
This cat is in heat
Let me ride that beat
My pussy on fire
Pussy five-alarm fire
This cat is in heat
Let me ride that beat
My pussy on fire
Pussy five-alarm fire

[Chorus: Miley Cyrus]
Turn up your gratitude, turn down your attitude
I love my pussy, that means I got cattitude
If you don't feel what I'm saying, I don't fuck with you
If you don't feel what I'm saying, I don't fuck with you
Turn up your gratitude, turn down your attitude
I love my pussy, that means I got cattitude
If you don't feel what I'm saying, I don't fuck with you
If you don't feel what I'm saying, I don't fuck with you

[Verse 2: Miley Cyrus]
Ayy, go stupid, go dumb
Come and get it 'cause I know you want some
Nashville, Tennessee where I'm from
Since I was three, I've been banging on the drum
Rum-pum-pum-pum, rum-pum-pum-pum-pum-pum
Rum-pum-pum-pum, rum-pum-pum-pum-pum-pum
Rum-pum-pum-pum, rum-pum-pum-pum-pum-pum
Rum-pum-pum-pum, rum-pum-pum-pum-pum

[Refrain: Miley Cyrus]
Nasty, I'm so nasty, nasty
I'm nasty, I'm so motherfucking nasty

[Verse 3: RuPaul]
Ride, shine, clock said pussy time
Bust my pussy nut while I'm fingering your butt
Do I suck dick? You ain't seen shit
Throw a C-note, watch you slide down my throat
Yeah, my pussy fine, I pop it 'cause it's mine
I don't give a fuck if they call me a slut
What I do with a dick, elect me presidick
Put tears in his eyes when I milk a brother dry

[Refrain: Miley Cyrus & RuPaul]
I'm so nasty, I'm nasty 
I'm nasty, I'm nasty

[Verse 4: Miley Cyrus & RuPaul]
I'ma keep working from dawn to dusk
So I can keep buying cars off Elon Musk
The matte black spinners, now that's a must
But I want the whole pie, so leave the crust
I'm the moon, I'm the stars, I'm a Maserati
I love you, Nicki, but I listen to Cardi
I got a new song on the radio, and it goes five

That's right, it's a number one
And I can't take you with me as a carry on
I already got my luggage, it's Margiela
And for my 16th birthday, I got Deron
From the house of the queen
Queen, queen, that's what you can call me
Queen, I'ma have you run to your mommy
Queen, I'm the life of the party
Don't worry 'bout me, go and get yourself a hobby

I'm so nasty


[Chorus: Miley Cyrus]
Turn up your gratitude, turn down your attitude
I love my pussy, that means I got cattitude
If you don't feel what I'm saying, I don't fuck with you
If you don't feel what I'm saying, I don't fuck with you

[Post-Chorus: Miley Cyrus & RuPaul]
 I'm so nasty
 I'm so nasty


[Chorus: Miley Cyrus]
Ru, turn up your gratitude, turn down your attitude
I love my pussy, that means I got cattitude
If you don't feel what I'm saying, I don't fuck with you
If you don't feel what I'm saying, I don't fuck with you

[Bridge: Miley Cyrus]
Back up, you're squashing my charisma
Why I gotta be so motherfucking extra?
Back up, you're squashing my charisma
Why I gotta be so motherfucking extra?

[Post-Chorus: Miley Cyrus & RuPaul]
 I'm so nasty
 I'm nasty
 I'm so nasty
 I'm so motherfucking nasty

[Outro: Miley Cyrus]
You're just mad 'cause your hair is flat

You're just mad 'cause your hair is flat

[Bridge]
 feel like I am one with the universe
 and all I need is right here
 feel like I am part of the universe
And it's part of me

[Verse 1]
 why there is a sun?
And how do birds fly?
And why there is a moon
Way up in the sky?
Why there is trees? 
And what the fuck is love? 
And what is flying saucers
Watching from above?


[Bridge]
Feel like I am one with the universe
And all I need is right here
Feel like I am part of the universe
And it's part of me

[Verse 2]
Yo, sing about love
Love is what you need
Loving what you sing
And loving smoking weed

Sing about peace
Being high and free
So if you don't give a fuck, sing along with me

[Chorus]
Yeah, I smoke pot 
Yeah, I love peace 
But I don't give a fuck 
I ain't no hippy 

[Verse 3]

And why do pigs run?
And why them motherfuckers
Putting bullets in they gun?

[Verse 1]
Feels like I just woke up
Like all this time I've been asleep
Even though it's not who I am
I'm not afraid of who I used to be

[Chorus]
No one stays the same 
You know what goes up must come down 
Change is a thing you can count on 
I feel so much younger now 

[Verse 2]
Feels like I've been living in a dream
But never make it to the end
My eyes open when they feel the light
It's always right before I'm about to scream

[Chorus]
No one stays the same 
You know what goes up must come down 
Change is a thing you can count on 
I feel so much younger now 

[Bridge]
What goes up must come down
What goes up must come down
What goes up must come down
What goes up must come down 

[Chorus]
No one stays the same 
You know what goes up must come down 
Change is a thing you can count on 
I feel so much younger now 

[Outro]
I feel so much younger now 
I feel so much younger now[Prod. by Mike WiLL Made It]

[Intro: Miley Cyrus]
Bangerz... fuckin' bangerz
Bangerz... fuck-fuck-fuckin' bangerz!

[Verse 1: Miley Cyrus]
All the way in the back with a tree on my lap
All the boys like to ask me, "What you doing with that?"
Yeah, yeah
You say you love me, I ain't fooling with that
They ask me how I keep a man, I keep a battery pack
One day he wants me
One day he wants me not
I don't do chances, 'cause time just ain't what I got
If he's like that, I got a world tour that they need me at
I can't be sittin' 'round here waiting for a man to tell me where the fuck my seat be at
Where Mike WiLL at?

[Chorus: Miley Cyrus]
We be struttin' that stuff, that stuff, that stuff 
We be struttin' that stuff, that stuff, that stuff 
We be struttin' that stuff, that stuff, that stuff 
We be struttin' that stuff, that stuff, that stuff 
We be struttin' that stuff, that stuff, that stuff 
We be struttin' that stuff, that stuff, that stuff 
We be struttin' that stuff, that stuff, that stuff 
We be struttin' that stuff, that stuff, that stuff 

[Verse 2: Britney Spears & ]
I'm flying high up on the bird; acrophobiac
I slick, caught her eyeing down my purse
Where the dollars at?
I let her know the rent's due on the first
They can call the hearse
'Cause, if there's any violation, I go off with that
Catwalk, slick talk, flirting with a big dog

You know I'm on that "meow", quick to scratch your eyes out
Strutting on the court, make them nervous, call a timeout

[Chorus: Miley Cyrus]
We be struttin' that stuff, that stuff, that stuff 
We be struttin' that stuff, that stuff, that stuff 
We be struttin' that stuff, that stuff, that stuff 
We be struttin' that stuff, that stuff, that stuff 
We be struttin' that stuff, that stuff, that stuff 
We be struttin' that stuff, that stuff, that stuff 
We be struttin' that stuff, that stuff, that stuff 
We be struttin' that stuff, that stuff, that stuff 

[Bridge: Miley Cyrus]
The plane, boss, the plane
Bout to get that big rock
Sit that on my hand
Make that media big talk
The plane, boss, the plane
Psych, that must be the purple
Got up in my brain
Had me a little bit dismal

[Outro: Miley Cyrus]
I, I, I
Bangerz
I, I, I
Fucking bangerz
I, I, I
Bangerz
I, I, I
Fucking bangerz
I, I, I
I, I, I
I, I, I
I, I, I

[Verse]
I'm writing down my dreams, all I'd like to see
Starting with the bees or else they're gonna die
There will be no trees or air for us to breathe
I start feeling mad, but then I feel inspired
Thinkin' about the days
Coming home with dirty feet from playing with my dad
All day in the creek
He somehow has a way of knowing what to say
So when I'm feeling sad, he makes me feel inspired

[Chorus]
We are meant for more
You're the handle on the door that opens up to change
I know it sounds so strange
To think we are meant for more
You're the handle on the door that opens up the change
I know that sounds so strange
Because you always felt so small, but know you aren't at all
And I hope you feel inspired
Oh, I hope you feel inspired

[Bridge]
How can we escape all the fear and all the hate?
Is anyone watching us down here?
Death is life, it's not a curse
Reminds us of time and what it's worth
To make the most out of it while we're here

[Chorus]
We are meant for more
You're the handle on the door that opens up to change
I know it sounds so strange
We are meant for more
There's a lock upon the door, but we hold the key to change

[Outro]
But how can we escape all the fear and all the hate?
Is anyone watching us down here?

Mike WiLL Made

[Chorus]
Drive my heart into the night
You could drop the keys off in the morning 
'Cause I don't wanna leave home, without your love
Without it

[Verse 1]
You told me that you wanted this
I told you it was all yours
If you're done with it, then what'd you say forever for?
If forever's out the door
I'll ignore when you call

[Chorus]
Drive my heart into the night 
You could drop the keys off in the morning 
'Cause I don't wanna leave home without your love
Without it

[Verse 2]
You told me you were coming back, right back
You promised it was real, and I believed that
But if I fall for it again, I will be a fool
If our love is at the end, then why do I still want you? Yeah
But I guess I got no valentine
Send me roses, I'll just let 'em die
I was crazy thinking you were mine
It was all just a lie

[Chorus]
Drive my heart into the night
You could drop the keys off in the morning
'Cause I don't wanna leave home  without your love
Without it

[Bridge]
I always knew I never wanted this
I never thought it could happen 
You acted like you wanted this
But then you led me on 
I thought you would be there when I go 
You promised you would be there when I go 
But all broken promises, I won't miss, I'm finished
All I know are the facts
That when I look you in the eyes, all I see are the lies
Been there, done that

[Chorus]
Drive my heart into the night 
You could drop the keys off in the morning
'Cause I don't wanna leave home without your love
Without it

[Verse 1]
Alright, so this is really fucked up, but
Alright, I was sleeping next to him but I was dreaming about the other dude
And then all of a sudden, everything that he fucking did just made me cringe and it was so hard to fall in but so easy just to fall back right out again
This whole time, I could give to you and I could paint you pictures but I guess I could just never write a song and then maybe I'd never fell out of love with him in the first place
I mean, I, I don't wanna feel this feeling cause my energy's just so strong that, I don't know if I'm creating this or this is actually what is meant to be
And you know that, they say that you gotta think what you want into existence, but you know, I haven't been too good at making decisions so, I have no idea what the fuck I want, I guess

[Chorus 1]
You're giving me a feeling in my head
Laying in my bed just thinking
Not really feeling like the one I want
Takes everything in me not to call him
I really, really, really want it, too
I told all my friends I'm moving on
Your baby talk is creeping me out
Fuck me so you stop baby talking

[Verse 2]
You know what, in the beginning it was like we were fucking homies and shit and then all of a sudden you started with some fucking baby goo-goo tongue down my fucking throat
I mean, even in front of your mom
Dude, as if I'm not fucking awkward enough
I mean, you put me in these fucking situations where I look like a dumbass bitch and I'm not a fucking dumbass bitch
You know, like, I hate all that fucking PDA, I probably hate it more than your fucking friends do
You know, it's sweet and you couldn't be more opposite of my last dickhead but, you know I just, I don't know if I can get over the fucking goo

[Chorus 2]
You keep saying again and again
We're laying in my bed just talking
And now I, now I can't hold it back
I'm feeling like I'm gonna vomit
I don't really wanna let go of you
I heard I change my mind way too often
Your baby talk is creeping me out
Fuck me so you stop baby talking

[Verse 3]
Alright, so, I'm gonna be honest
It's the super cutey shit, that's the main issue here
I mean, I'm fucking what?
Look, I like when you send me, you know, the, the queen emoji, but when I send back the monkey, you know, the ones with the, the hands over the eyes? That means that shit's just getting a little too weird for me
I mean, I don't wanna say it in person, I just bury my head in your armpit which... weirdly smells good and your hair and your fucking teeth
Like, why the fuck would I wanna lick your teeth but I do
And remember there was that one time that I had like a 15 minute...
Well, that was kind of the best thing in the entire world
You know, maybe I could just get past this shit and I could get used to someone giving a fuck
I'm sorry I called you a creep and that thing about the vomit
I mean, look, I'm really starting to be in this whole thing, but no matter what you do, homegirl can't handle the fucking goo

[Chorus 3]
Fuck me so you'll stop baby talking
Fuck me so you'll stop baby talking
Fuck me so you'll stop baby talking
Fuck me so you'll stop baby talking
I don't really wanna get over you
I heard I change my mind way too often
Baby talk is creeping me out
Fuck me so you'll stop baby talking

[Chorus]
If you're looking for love, know that love don't live here anymore
He left with my heart
They both walked through that door without me
If you're trying to find pity, well, you need to look somewhere else
'Cause I surely can't help you
I'm hurting myself
I've turned into someone else

[Verse 1]
I used to believe love conquers all
'Cause that's what's seen in movies
Come to find out it's not like that at all
You see, real life's much different

[Refrain]
I don't wanna see you go
I only wanna see you smile
It hurts so much just thinking of
Felt like this for awhile
I can't stand to see us there
We cried, we lied
Cannot pretend to take us back to what we had
To make us feel alive again

[Pre-Chorus]
Hold me close
Don't let me go
I hope
Tell me now is not the end

[Chorus]
If you're looking for love, know that love don't live here anymore
He left with my heart
They both walked through that door without me
If you're trying to find pity, well, you need to look somewhere else
'Cause I surely can't help you
I'm hurting myself
I've turned into someone else 
I've turned into someone else

[Verse 2]
I used to believe love conquers all
'Cause that's what I felt when you held me
I thought you'd catch me if I fall
And fill me up when I'm empty

[Refrain]
I don't wanna see you go
I only wanna see you smile
It hurts so much just thinking of
Felt like this for awhile
I can't stand to see us there
We cried, we lied
Cannot pretend to take us back to what we had
To make us feel alive again

[Pre-Chorus]
Hold me close
Don't let me go
I hope
Tell me now is not the end

[Chorus]
If you're looking for love, know that love don't live here anymore
He left with my heart
They both walked through that door without me
If you're trying to find pity, well, you need to look somewhere else
'Cause I surely can't help you
I'm hurting myself
I've turned into someone else

[Bridge]
Love is patient, love is selfless
Love is hopeful, love is kind
Love is jealous, love is selfish
Love is hopeless, love is blind
Love is patient, love is selfless
Love is hopeful, love is kind
Love is jealous, love is selfish
Love is hopeless, love is blind
Love is patient, love is selfless
Love is hopeful, love is kind
Love is jealous, love is selfish
Love is hopeless, love is blind
Yeah, yeah
Ooh, yeah

[Outro]
I've turned into someone else

[Intro]
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse 1]
This winter was as cold as you and I
I know you're home, hoping I'm alright
How many times have I left you in the deep?
I don't know why you still believe in me

[Chorus]
Oh, and even in my darkest days, even in my lowest place
You love me the most
And even when I can't stay, even when I run away
You love me the most
So why do I hurt you so? Is it 'cause I know?
Why do I hurt you so? Is it 'cause you love me the most?

[Post-Chorus]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, the most
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Is it 'cause I know? Is it 'cause you love me the most?
Yeah, yeah, yeah, the most
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Is it 'cause I know? Yeah

[Verse 2]
Your tender touch is the healing that I seek
I come to you when my judgement becomes weak
All that you are is all I ever need
I don't know why you still believe in me

[Chorus]
Oh, and even in my darkest days, even in my lowest place
You love me the most
And even when I can't stay, even when I run away
You love me the most
So why do I hurt you so? Is it 'cause I know?
Why do I hurt you so? Is it 'cause you love me the most?

[Post-Chorus]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, the most
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Is it 'cause I know? Is it 'cause you love me the most?
Yeah, yeah, yeah, the most
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Is it 'cause I know? Yeah

[Outro]
How many times have I left you in the deep?
I don't know why you still believe in me

[Chorus]
I'm a little drunk, I know it
Ima get high as hell
I'm a little bit unholy
So what? So is everyone else
I'm a little drunk, I know it
Ima get high as hell
I'm a little bit unholy
So what? So is everyone else

[Verse]
Wake up in the middle of a breakdown, yeah, uh
Have sex on the table with the takeout 
I'm sick of the faking, the using, the taking
The people calling me obscene
You hate me, you love me, you just wanna touch me
I'm only trying to get some peace
So let me do me

[Chorus]
I'm a little drunk, I know it
I'ma get high as hell
I'm a little bit unholy
So what? So is everyone else 
I'm a little drunk, I know it
Ima get high as hell
Im a little bit unholy
So what? So is everyone else

[Post-Chorus]
So what? So is everyone else
So what? So is everyone else

[Chorus]
I'm a little drunk, I know it
Ima get high as hell
I'm a little bit unholy
So what? So is everyone else

[Post-Chorus]
So what? So is everyone else
So what? So is everyone else
Yeah

[Verse 1]
I feel a surge coming over me
I feel it all around my thighs
And chills going up my legs
This is the worst coming out of me
When I came, felt like I could die
And it sends chills up my spine

[Pre-Chorus]
You're sexy, sexy
I got things I wanna do to you
Make me, make me
Make my tongue just go do-do-do
Flex it, flex it
Flex your muscles, and go through the roof
Arrest it -rest it, 'cause you're a criminal

[Chorus]
I been laying in this bed all night long
Don't you think it's time to get it on?
But we gotta get it right, we can't get it wrong
Don't you wanna fuel this fire before it's gone? Yeah, yeah

[Verse 2]
I feel the thirst pouring out of me
The things that I wanna try
That echoes in my head
This is the first time I get to see
Things I've never seen in my life, yeah
You make flowers grow under my bed, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
You're sexy, sexy
I got things I wanna do to you
Make me, make me
Make my tongue just go do-do-do
Flex it, flex it
Flex your muscles, and go through the roof
Arrest it -rest it, 'cause you're a criminal

[Chorus]
I been laying in this bed  all night long 
Don't you think it's time? 
But we gotta get it right 
We can't get it wrong 
Don't you wanna fuel this fire before it's gone? Yeah, yeah

[Spoken Interlude]
Do you feel me?
Oh! I thought so
I just uh... sometime you just wanna... be naughty!

[Bridge]
Feel so alone when you are gone
Feeling right back home when I'm in your arms
You played my strings, like my guitar
When I look in your eyes, I see all the stars

[Verse 3]
Would you believe
I'm dancing in the mirror? 
I feel like I got no panties on
I wish that I could feel ya 
So hurry, hang up that damn phone

[Chorus]
I been laying in this bed  all night long 
Don't you think it's time? 
But we gotta get it right, we can't get it wrong
Don't you wanna fuel this fire before it's gone? Yeah, yeah

[Outro]
Going on and on and make it last forever
What you want all day?
Just as long as it's you and I together
Babe, don't make me wait, yeah
Ooh, oh
Don't make me wait
Yeah, yeah, yeah, uh
Baby

[Verse 1]
Chapter one; we started happy
The second that you said you loved me
Started questioning us
Are we really in love?
Tryna figure out chapter three
But you're not giving me anything
If this is what we are, then I gotta move on
You think this is everything, but this is no book of love

[Chorus]
You might think I'm crazy
That I'm lost and foolish leaving you behind
Maybe you're right
You might think I'm crazy
That I'm lost and foolish leaving you behind
Maybe you're right
Maybe you're right

[Verse 2]
Here comes the part of you and me
Arguing about nothing
You tell me it's as good as it gets
Yeah, I'm real emotional
Blame it on your mental jokes
How much did you think that I could take?
So much for taking this too far
You can't blame me for who I am
It's too late for us to try to be in love right now

[Chorus]
You might think I'm crazy
That I'm lost and foolish leaving you behind
Maybe you're right
You might think I'm crazy
That I'm lost and foolish leaving you behind
Maybe you're right
Maybe you're right

[Bridge]
Fill the pages now, this chapter's done
Moving on up and forward onto all that will become
If you ever get to the place where the sun is shining every day
Then I'll be on your mind

[Chorus]
You might think I'm crazy 
That I'm lost and foolish leaving you behind
Maybe you're right
You might think I'm crazy
That I'm lost and foolish leaving you behind
Maybe you're right
Maybe you're right

[Chorus: Miley Cyrus]
'Round and 'round and away we go
'Round and 'round and away we go
Four by four and away we go
High not low and away we go
'Round and 'round and away we go
And away we go and away we go
Four by four and away we go
High not low and away we go

[Verse 1: Miley Cyrus]
I'm a female rebel, can't you tell?
Bang on the dashboard, just chipped a nail
Lean out the window, that's when I yell
Driving so fast 'bout to piss on myself
Driving so fast 'bout to piss on myself
Police wanna get him and put him in jail
I'mma do whatever to get him his bail
Hooked on donuts and rooster-tails

[Pre-Chorus: Miley Cyrus]
I'm in that passenger seat, flying high in the air
And we're driving fast 'til we plumb out of gas, let's go

[Chorus: Miley Cyrus]
'Round and 'round and away we go
'Round and 'round and away we go
Four by four and away we go
High not low and away we go
'Round and 'round and away we go
And away we go and away we go
Four by four and away we go
High not low and away we go

[Verse 2: Miley Cyrus]
I'm a female rebel, can't you see?
Riding 'round your backyard, who could it be?
Pulling out the steering wheel right from the seat
Pumping his breaks to the sound of the beat
Pumping his breaks to the sound of the beat
He don't understand what he's doing to me
Deep down inside, like a pitbull in heat
Someone's coming, so we head for the streets

[Pre-Chorus: Miley Cyrus]
I'm in that passenger seat, flying high in the air
And we're driving fast 'til we plumb out of gas, let's go

[Chorus: Miley Cyrus]
'Round and 'round and away we go
'Round and 'round and away we go
Four by four and away we go
High not low and away we go
'Round and 'round and away we go
And away we go and away we go
Four by four and away we go
High not low and away we go

[Bridge: Miley Cyrus]
It's twelve o'clock and I don't wanna party
My big boyfriend and my big truck hobby
A little bit of dirt never hurt nobody
Now I got dirt all over my body
Might as well lie to L
His big fog lights is bright as hell
Calls it off, he starts to yell
He hits the gas so I grab the rail

[Verse 3: Nelly]
Sure you wanna ride with me?
If you scared, don't lie to me
I'm a crazy motherfucker from the Midwest
With a Mississippi flow and an Arch rest
Four by four with the altar steps
We doing donuts underneath the arch, yes!
I need a chick on time, don't mind being early
A ride-or-die, dollar six thirty
A straight-up chick like twelve o'clock
"I don't know where he at", that's what she tell the cops
Take a stand for a nigga, raise a hand for a nigga
"I solemnly swear he was with me all day"
To the judge, "he the one I love"
Hell they could tell, she don't even budge
'Round and 'round we go
Don't stop 'til I tell you so

[Pre-Chorus: Miley Cyrus]
I'm in that passenger seat, flying high in the air
And we're driving fast 'til we plumb out of gas, let's go

[Chorus: Miley Cyrus]
'Round and 'round and away we go
'Round and 'round and away we go
Four by four and away we go
High not low and away we go
'Round and 'round and away we go
And away we go and away we go
Four by four and away we go
High not low and away we go

[Outro: Miley Cyrus]
I'm a female rebel, who can't you tell, who can't you tell
Who can't you tell?
I'm a female rebel, who can't you tell, who can't you tell
Who can't you tell?

[Intro: Miley Cyrus & Future]
Stand by me
Oh, my darlin'
Stand by me

[Verse 1: Miley Cyrus]
I walked through a puddle of water
When I seen the shadow of a broken-hearted girl
Pictured us walking to the altar
For better or for worse

[Chorus: Miley Cyrus & Future]
Why don't you stand, stand by me?
Oh, my darlin', stand by me
'Cause we gon' make a movie, a movie
And it's gon' be in 3D, in 3D

And it's gon' be in 3D, in 3D

[Post-Chorus: Miley Cyrus & Future]
Why don't you stand, stand by me?
Oh, my darlin', stand by me

[Verse 2: Miley Cyrus & Future]
I ain't pop no Molly
But you still got me sweating
What happened to that feeling?
We'll never get it back
I aint take no shots, but you still got me hot
What happened to the feeling?
I wish it wouldn't stop
We were supposed to be together
We were supposed to be together, yeah

[Bridge: Miley Cyrus]
They say that love can hit you so fast
Plenty odds are running out of time
But ours are on the boardwalk, baby
Take me as I am or not
I can't breathe without you, without you as mine

[Chorus: Miley Cyrus & Future]
Why don't you stand, stand by me?
Oh, my darlin', stand by me
'Cause we gon' make a movie, a movie
And it's gon' be in 3D, in 3D
And we gon' make a movie, a movie
And it's gon' be in 3D, in 3D, yeah

Stand by me 
My darlin', stand by me
Stand, yeah

Movie, it's gon' be in 3D, 3D, yeah

[Chorus: Miley Cyrus & Future]
Why don't you stand, stand by me?
Oh, my darlin', stand by me
'Cause we gon' make a movie, a movie
And it's gon' be in 3D, in 3D
And we gon' make a movie, a movie
And it's gon' be in 3D, in 3D, yeah

[Outro: Miley Cyrus & Future]
Stand by me 
My darlin', stand by me
Stand, yeah

[Verse 1]
Oh, Karen
You take it all too hard
You been talking to those fools again
And they'll tear your world apart, mmm
Oh, Karen
You gotta try to understand
Gotta hold on to your soul
'Cause they'll crush it if they can

[Chorus]
So, Karen don't be sad
They're just a bunch of fools
And you can make them powerless
Don't let them make the rules
So, Karen don't be sad
You know the truth is true
The world can still be beautiful
That part's up to you
So, Karen don't be sad

[Verse 2]
Oh, Karen
You know you're only letting 'em win
By letting all their lies and hate destroy you from within-in
Oh, Karen
They've taken away your smile
But you can give it back to us
Just fake it for a while

[Chorus]
So, Karen don't be sad
They're just a bunch of fools
And you can make them powerless
Don't let them make the rules
So, Karen don't be sad
You know the truth is true
The world can still be beautiful
That part's up to you
So, Karen don't be sad

[Outro]
So, Karen don't be sad
Don't let 'em win
Oh, don't let 'em win
Don't let them win
Don't let them win
Oh, don't let them win
Oh, don't let them win
Don't let them win

If I can't trust, then why am I giving my heart in exchange for him to love me?
'Cause there ain't much
Difference than a one night stand and one that ain't for me
Is it too much?
'Cause you hate that you love everything that he do and you can't deny you wanna
So what?
My heart'll light a fire in this bitch and blow it

[Pre-Chorus: Miley Cyrus]
Money ain't nothing
Money can't buy you love, I don't give a damn if you sitting on a trill

I've been through heartbreaks, heartbreaks
Much more than anybody with a human heart can take
You know it's something not too good to elaborate
But I been left in the lobby
I done been through the fire, I done been the girl on the side
I done laid it all on the line
And now they growing up
And I bet you regret it 'cause it just don't taste like mine

[Pre-Chorus: Miley Cyrus]
Money ain't nothing
Money can't buy you love, I don't give a damn if you sitting on a trill

[Verse 1]
Smooth talking
So rocking
He's got everything that a girl's wanting
Guitar cutie
He plays it groovy
And I can't keep myself from doing something stupid
Think I'm really falling for his smile
Get butterflies when he says my name

[Chorus]
He's got something special, he's got something special
And when he's looking at me, I wanna get all sentimental
He's got something special, he's got something special
I can hardly breathe, something's telling me
Telling me maybe he could be the one
He could be the one, he could be the one
He could be the one, he could be the one, he could be the one

[Verse 2]
He's lightning
Sparks are flying
Everywhere I go, he's always on my mind
And I'm going crazy about him lately
And I can't help myself from how my heart is racing
Think I'm really digging on his vibe
He really blows me away 

[Chorus]
He's got something special, he's got something special
And when he's looking at me, I wanna get all sentimental
He's got something special, he's got something special
I can hardly breathe, something's telling me
Telling me maybe he could be the one
He could be the one, he could be the one
He could be the one, he could be the one, he could be the one

[Bridge]
And he's got a way of making me feel
Like everything I do is perfectly fine
The stars are aligned when I'm with him
And I'm so into him

[Chorus]
He's got something special, he's got something special
And when he's looking at me, I wanna get all sentimental
He's got something special, he's got something special
I can hardly breathe, something's telling me
Telling me maybe he could be the one
He could be the one, he could be the one
He could be the one, he could be the one, he could be the one

[Verse 1]
You wake up
Its raining and its Monday
Looks like one of those rough days
Times up
Youre late again, so get out the door
Sometimes you feel like running
Find a whole new life and jump in
Let go, get up and hit the dance-floor

[Pre-Chorus 1]
But when the lights go down, its the ending of the show
And youre feeling like you got nowhere to go
Dont you know...

[Chorus]
You can change your hair and you can change your clothes
You can change your mind, thats just the way it goes
You can say "goodbye", and you can say "hello"
But youll always find your way back home
You can change your style, you can change your jeans
You can learn to fly and you can chase your dreams
You can laugh and cry, but everybody knows
Youll always find your way back home

[Verse 2]
Your best friends, your little hometown
Are waiting up wherever you go now
You know that you can always turn around
'Cause this world is big and its crazy
And this girl is thinking that maybe
This life is what some people dream about

[Pre-Chorus 2]
'Cause when Im feeling down and I am all alone
Ive always got a place where I can go
'Cause I know...

[Chorus]
You can change your hair and you can change your clothes
You can change your mind, thats just the way it goes
You can say goodbye, and you can say hello
But youll always find your way back home
You can change your style, you can change your jeans
You can learn to fly and you can chase your dreams
You can laugh and cry, but everybody knows
Youll always find your way back home

[Bridge]
Where they know exactly who you are
Back home, where the real you is the superstar
Back home, you know its never too far away

[Breakdown]
You can change your hair and you can change your clothes
You can change your mind, thats just the way it goes
You can say goodbye, and you can say hello
But youll always find your way back

[Chorus]
You can change your hair and you can change your clothes
You can change your mind, thats just the way it goes
You can say goodbye, and you can say hello
But youll always find your way back home
You can change your style, you can change your jeans
You can learn to fly and you can chase your dreams
You can laugh and cry, but everybody knows
Youll always find your way back home

[Outro]
Youll always find your way back home
Youll always find your way back home
Youll always find your way back home
Youll always find your way back home
Youll always, you'll always find your way
Youll always find your way  back home

[Verse 1]
Everybody needs inspiration
Everybody needs a song
A beautiful melody
When the night's so long

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause there is no guarantee
That this life is easy

[Chorus]
Yeah, when my world is falling apart
When there's no light to break up the dark
That's when I, I
I look at you
When the waves
Are flooding the shore and I can't
Find my way home anymore
That's when I, I
I look at you

[Verse 2]
When I look at you, I see forgiveness
I see the truth
You love me for who I am
Like the stars hold the moon
Right there where they belong
And I know I'm not alone

[Chorus]
Yeah, when my world is falling apart
When there's no light to break up the dark
That's when I, I
I look at you
When the waves
Are flooding the shore and I can't
Find my way home anymore
That's when I, I
I look at you

[Bridge]
You appear just like a dream to me
Just like kaleidoscope colors that
Cover me, all I need
Every breath that I breathe
Don't you know you're beautiful?
Yeah, yeah, yeah

[Chorus]
When the waves
Are flooding the shore and I can't
Find my way home anymore
That's when I, I
I look at you
I look at you

[Outro]
You appear just like a dream
To me

[Verse 1]
I always knew this day would come
We'd be standing one by one
With our future in our hands
So many dreams, so many plans
I always knew after all these years
There'd be laughter, there'd be tears
But never thought that I'd walk away
With so much joy but so much pain
And it's so hard to say goodbye

[Chorus]
But yesterday's gone, we gotta keep moving on
I'm so thankful for the moments
So glad I got to know ya
The times that we had, I'll keep like a photograph
And hold you in my heart forever
I'll always remember you

[Verse 2]
Another chapter in the book
Cant go back, but you can look
And there we are on every page
Memories I'll always save
Up ahead, only open doors
Who knows what we're heading towards
I wish you love, I wish you luck
For you, the world just opens up
But it's so hard to say goodbye

[Chorus]
Yesterday's gone, we gotta keep moving on
I'm so thankful for the moments
So glad I got to know ya
The times that we had, I'll keep like a photograph
And hold you in my heart forever
I'll always remember you

[Bridge]
Every day that we had, all the good, all the bad
I'll keep them here inside
All the times that we shared, every place, everywhere
You touched my life
Yeah, one day we'll look back, we'll smile, and we'll laugh
But right now we just cry
'Cause it's so hard to say goodbye

[Chorus]
Yesterday's gone, we gotta keep moving on
I'm so thankful for the moments
So glad I got to know ya
The times that we had, I'll keep like a photograph
And hold you in my heart forever
I'll always remember you
I'll always remember you
I'll always remember you

[Verse 1]
I wanna start by saying thank you
I'm gonna miss ya, honey
You gave me things you cant buy back with money
You changed my life
You've been my world
There's no other girl that looks like ya, darling
Those eyes, that tongue, those teeth, that face, that body
Even though weve gone to outer space
Still no way you can take his place

[Chorus]
You're not him
Yeah, she's not him
No matter what you say
No matter what you do
I just can't fall in love with you
'Cause you're not him
Yeah, she's not him

[Verse 2]
And why, why can't I love you, baby?
Like I wanna love you, baby
Im sorry
And maybe its beyond my control
Some sort of chemical reaction
Making it impossible to let him go

[Chorus]
You're not him
Shes not him
No matter what you say
No matter what you do
I just can't fall in love with you
'Cause you're not him
Yeah, shes not him

[Bridge]
And you don't deserve
All the bullshit I've put you through
You, you deserve
A heart much bigger than one that's torn in two
Oh, oh

[Chorus]
You're not him 
She's not him
Every time you walk through my door
I swear to God you're more beautiful than before
But you're not him
No matter what you say
No matter what you do
I just can't fall in love with you
'Cause you're not him
Yeah, she's not him

[Verse 1]
How can I love someone I never touched?
You lived under the water, but I love you so much
You never been on land, and you never seen the sky
You don't know what a cloud is
Why does everything I love have to die?
They all wanted to see you be as big as you could be
But I couldn't let that be
By keeping you small, by keeping you safe
If I could do it again, I'd release you to sea
'Cause I can't bear to see something so wild just die in a tank

[Chorus 1]
And Pablow the blowfish
I miss you so much
And Pablow the blowfish
I miss you so bad

[Verse 2]
On Saturday night, we all went out to eat
But I can never decide, so someone chose sushi
I got soup, and I ordered rice
But watching my friends eat my friends, ruined my appetite

[Chorus 2]
Oh, Pablow the blowfish
If they only knew you like I do
They'd love you too
And Pablow the blowfish
I miss you so bad

[Verse 3]
I won't forget, even one second we had
'Cause you might be gone, but you could never be dead
I heard of a seahorse named Sadie
I heard she was quite the lady
Maybe you'll find her and you could make babies
That'd be kind of crazy

[Bridge]
If Pablow the blowfish
Found love deep in the sea
Then that would mean
Pablow the blowfish
Is better off than here with me

[Outro]
But Pablow the blowfish
I miss you so bad

[Intro]
Sha
Sha
Sha

[Verse 1]
I probably shouldn't say this
But at times, I get so scared
When I think about the previous
Relationship we've shared
It was awesome, but we lost it
It's not possible for me not to care
And now we're standing in the rain
But nothing's ever gonna change until you hear, my dear

[Chorus]
The seven things I hate about you
The seven things I hate about you, oh, you
You're vain, your games, you're insecure
You love me, you like her
You make me laugh, you make me cry
I don't know which side to buy
Your friends, they're jerks
When you act like them, just know, it hurts
I wanna be with the one I know
And the seventh thing I hate the most that you do
You make me love you

[Verse 2]
It's awkward and silent as I wait for you to say
But what I need to hear now, your sincere apology
When you mean it, I'll believe it
If you text it, I'll delete it
Let's be clear 
Oh, I'm not coming back
You're taking seven steps here

[Chorus]
The seven things I hate about you
You're vain, your games, you're insecure
You love me, you like her
You make me laugh, you make me cry
I don't know which side to buy
Your friends, they're jerks
When you act like them, just know, it hurts
I wanna be with the one I know
And the seventh thing I hate the most that you do
You make me love you

[Bridge]
And compared to all the great things
That would take too long to write
I probably should mention the seven that I like

[Chorus]
The seven things I like about you
Your hair, your eyes, your old Levi's
When we kiss, I'm hypnotized
You make me laugh, you make me cry
But I guess that's both I'll have to buy
Your hand in mine
When we're intertwined, everything's alright
I wanna be with the one I know
And the seventh thing I like the most that you do
You make me love you

[Outro]
Sha, sha
You do, oh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh 
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh

[Verse 1]
Here we are now
Everything's about to change
We face tomorrow
As we say goodbye to yesterday
A chapter ending
But the story's only just begun
A page is turning for everyone

[Chorus]
So, Im moving on, letting go
Holding onto tomorrow
Oh, Ive always got the memories
While Im finding out who Im gonna be
We might be apart
But I hope you always know
Youll be with me
Wherever I go
Wherever I go

[Verse 2]
So excited
I can barely even catch my breath
We have each other
To lean on for the road ahead
This happy ending
Is the start of all our dreams
And I know your heart is with me

[Chorus]
So, Im moving on, letting go
Holding onto tomorrow
Oh, Ive always got the memories
While Im finding out who Im gonna be
We might be apart
But I hope you always know
Youll be with me
Wherever I go

[Bridge]
It's time to show the world
Weve got something to say
A song to sing out loud
Well never fade away
I know Ill miss you
But well meet again someday
Well never fade away

[Chorus]
So, Im moving on, letting go
Holding onto tomorrow
Oh, Ive always got the memories
While Im finding out who Im gonna be
We might be apart
But I hope you always know
Youll be with me... 

[Chorus]
So, Im moving on, letting go
Holding onto tomorrow 
Oh, Ive always got the memories
While Im finding out who Im gonna be
We might be apart
But I hope you always know
Youll be with me, yeah
Wherever I go

[Outro]
Wherever I
Wherever I go

[Verse 1]
They say love can drive ya crazy, my dear
I wanna trap you in a locket, or in my pocket
So I can keep you near
You know I'd never hurt you
If you fall, Id pick you up and I'd drink your tears
But how can I miss you so much when you're right here?

[Verse 2]
They say good things come to those who wait
Its like countin' in light years
I'd physically live without you, but I don't want to
And death's never been my fear
You can take my blood, take my bones
My heart is yours, I volunteer
But how can I miss you so much when you're right here?

[Chorus]
When you look up at a rainbow
Do you ever wonder what's really waiting at the end?
I don't want no gold, nothings more than you
The amount is hard to even comprehend
Nothing I can do, I lost control
Something we hold on to so dear
But how can I miss you so much when youre right here?

[Verse 3]
And how at this optimal time did you just appear?
Everyone under their guard, so full of shit
But you are just so sheer
You're my God, youre my faith
On my knees, I look at you and I revere
But how can I miss you so much when you're right here?

[Chorus]
When you look up at the cosmos
Do you ever wonder if there's really even an end?
It might go on forever, like my love for you
An amount that's hard to even comprehend
I wont waste my time with wonder, in apprehension, or livin' life in fear
But how can I miss you so much when you're right here?

[Verse 4]
You're my God, you're my faith
On my knees, I look at you and I revere
You can take my blood, take my bones
My heart is yours, I volunteer
But how can I miss you so much when you're right here?
But how can I miss you so much when you're right here?

[Verse 1]
I sleep with the door open if you want to come in while I'm sleeping
I'm always sleeping naked, 'cause you wake up and you're creeping
Want to lick it so much that it's almost like I taste it on the tip of my tongue
I want to touch it so bad that it's almost like I can feel it on my fingertips
I want yours inside of me, but don't forget where I like licking, babe
I want to make your fantasies realities I want to be your's, babe

[Chorus]
I want you to bang my box
I want you to bang my box

[Verse 2]
There ain't nothing I'm scared to try
I can be on top, or if you like it I just lie here
Take my picture
Position my body wherever you like
Just know I like it naughty
Teach me a lesson, pretend we never met
But we can keep just kissing, 'cause you're getting me so wet
The only downside to this morning is you getting up and you leaving
When I'm dreaming and you're in 'em I wake myself up, 'cause I'm screaming
Uh-huh, what are you doing to me?
It's like you're a zookeeper setting animals free
You release me like a tiger that's been locked in a cage
Here I am, here you are
I want it so hard
You finger my heart
And I know just what I need
What I came here to do
What I've been thinking, babe, been most about you

[Chorus]
I want you to bang my box
I want you to bang my box

[Outro]
You say it tastes like cake with my lips against your face
Want you to eat it, babe

[Verse 1]
I had a dream Davie Bowie taught us how to skateboard
But he was shaped like Gumby
And I had a dream we took a helicopter
Flew it up too high, got stuck in the clouds
Don't wanna come down
And I had a dream
We went on a safari
I said, "Look at that lion, she reminds me of you 'cause you're the queen."
And I had a dream that you were dying
But I wasn't even crying
I just sang you to sleep, I sang you to sleep

[Chorus]
But what does it mean?
What does it all mean?
Oh, I had a dream
What did it mean?
What did it mean?

[Verse 2]
And I had a dream we robbed the record store
The one with the yellow door
We stole every goddamn record they had
And I had a dream that I didn't give a fuck
But I give a fuck
I miss you so bad, I think I might die

[Chorus]
What does it mean?
What does it all mean?
I had a dream
But, what did it mean?
What did it mean?
I just wanna scream
What does it mean?
What does it mean?
I just wanna scream
I just wanna scream

[Breakdown]
What does it mean?
What does it mean?
What does it mean?
I had a dream
But what does it mean?
What does it mean?
I had a dream
But what does it mean?
What does it mean?
What does it all mean, mean?

[Verse 3]
And I had a dream we were being chased by a monster
Or maybe they were aliens
But I wasn't scared 'cause you were there
And I had a dream we took karate
That's when you said you loved me
You loved me

[Outro]
What does it mean?
What does it all mean?
What does it mean?
What does it all mean?
Fuck yeah

[Verse 1: Miley Cyrus]
You tucked me in, turned out the light
Kept me safe and sound at night
Little girls depend on things like that
Brushed my teeth and combed my hair
Had to drive me everywhere
You were always there when I looked back
You had to do it all alone
Make a living, make a home
Must have been as hard as it could been
And when I couldn't sleep at night
Scared things wouldn't turn out right
You would hold my hand and sing to me

[Chorus: Miley Cyrus + Billy Ray Cyrus]
Caterpillar in the tree
How you wonder who you'll be
Can't go far, but you can always dream
Wish you may, and wish you might
Don't you worry, hold on tight
I promise you there will come a day
Butterfly fly away

[Verse 2: Miley Cyrus + Billy Ray Cyrus + Both]
Butterfly fly away 
Got your wings, now you can't stay
Take those dreams and make them all come true
Butterfly fly away 
You've been waiting for this day
All along you've known just what to do

[Outro: Both]
Butterfly, butterfly, butterfly, butterfly fly away
Butterfly fly away
Butterfly fly away

[Verse 1]
You are everything to me
And I, I would die for you
There've been times where I'm up all night
Crying in the dark, so I sleep with the light on
I've heard I've got words like a knife
That I don't know how to choose just so wisely
But I see trees and their colored leaves
When I think about all that we could be

[Chorus]
When you're gone, time moves so slow
Like the grass, I've watched us grow
I've heard you reap only what you'll sow
How could I never let you know?

[Verse 2]
That you are everything to me
You're sweeter than candy and better than any childhood dreams
I am yours and you are mine
I have your heart, I don't even need a ring
I'd give up all I have in exchange for who I love more than anything

[Chorus]
When you're gone, time moves so slow
Like the grass, I've watched us grow
I've heard you reap only what you'll sow
How could I ever let you know?

[Bridge]
'Cause you, you're everything to me
And I, I would die for you
Yeah, I would die for you

[Chorus]
When you're gone time, moves so slow 
Like the grass, I've watched us grow 
I've heard you reap only what you'll sow 
How could I never let you know?
I would die for you

[Intro]


[Verse 1]
We should take this back to my place
That's what she said right to my face
'Cause I want you bad
Yeah, I want you, baby
I've been thinkin' 'bout it all day
And I hope you feel the same way, yeah
'Cause I want you bad
Yeah, I want you, baby

[Chorus]
Slow, slow hands
Like sweat drippin' down our dirty laundry
No, no chance
That I'm leavin' here without you on me
I, I know
Yeah, I already know that there ain't no stoppin'
Your plans and those
Slow hands 
Slow hands

[Verse 2]
I just wanna take my time
We could do this, baby, all night, yeah
'Cause I want you bad
Yeah, I want you, baby

[Chorus]
Slow, slow hands
Like sweat drippin' down our dirty laundry
No, no chance
That I'm leavin' here without you on me
I, I know
Yeah, I already know that there ain't no stoppin'
Your plans and those
Slow hands 

[Bridge]
Fingertips puttin' on a show
Got me now and I can't say no
Wanna be with you all alone
Take me home, take me home
Fingertips puttin' on a show
Can't you tell that I want you, baby, yeah

[Chorus]
Slow hands
Like sweat drippin' down our dirty laundry
No, no chance
That I'm leavin' here without you on me
I, I know
Yeah, I already know that there ain't no stoppin'
Slow hands
Like sweat drippin' down our dirty laundry
No, no chance
That I'm leavin' here without you on me
I, I know
Yeah, I already know that there ain't no stoppin'
Your plans and those
Slow hands 
Slow hands
Woo, slow hands

[Verse 1]
Waking up to kiss you and nobodys there
The smell of your perfume still stuck in the air
Its hard
Yesterday I thought I saw your shadow running round
Its funny how things never change in this old town
So far from the stars

[Pre-Chorus]
And I want to tell you everything
The words I never got to say the first time around
And I remember everything
From when we were the children playing in this fairground
Wish I was there with you now

[Chorus]
If the whole world was watching Id still dance with you
Drive highways and byways to be there with you
Over and over the only truth
Everything comes back to you

[Verse 2]
I saw that you moved on with someone new
In the pub that we met hes got his arms around you
Its so hard
So hard

[Pre-Chorus]
And I want to tell you everything
The words I never got to say the first time around
And I remember everything
From when we were the children playing in this fairground
Wish I was there with you now

[Chorus]
Because if the whole world was watching Id still dance with you
Drive highways and byways to be there with you
Over and over the only truth
Everything comes back to you

You still make me nervous when you walk in the room
Them butterflies they come alive when Im next to you
Over and over the only truth
Everything comes back to you

[Bridge]
And I know that its wrong
That I cant move on
But theres something about you

[Chorus]
If the whole world was watching Id still dance with you
Drive highways and byways to be there with you
Over and over the only truth
Everything comes back to you
You still make me nervous when you walk in the room
Them butterflies they come alive when Im next to you
Over and over the only truth
Everything comes back to you
Everything comes back to you

[Verse 1]
Waiting here for someone
Only yesterday, we were on the run
You smile back at me and your face lit up the sun
Now I'm waiting here for someone

[Pre-Chorus 1]
And oh, love, do you feel this rough?
Why's it only you I'm thinking of?

[Chorus]
My shadow's dancing
Without you for the first time
My heart is hoping
You'll walk right in tonight
To tell me there are things that you regret
'Cause if I'm being honest, I ain't over you yet
It's all I'm asking
Is it too much to ask?
Is it too much to ask?

[Verse 2]
Someone's moving outside
The lights come on down the drive
I forget you're not here when I close my eyes
Do you still think of me sometimes?

[Pre-Chorus 2]
And oh, love, watch the sun coming up
Dont it feel fucked up we're not in love?

[Chorus]
My shadow's dancing
Without you for the first time
My heart is hoping
You'll walk right in tonight
To tell me there are things that you regret
'Cause if I'm being honest, I ain't over you yet
It's all I'm asking
Is it too much to ask?

[Bridge]
My shadow's dancing
Without you for the first time
My heart is hoping
You'll walk right in tonight
And tell me there are things that you regret
'Cause if I'm being honest, I ain't over you yet

[Chorus]
My shadow's dancing
Without you for the first time
My heart is hoping
You'll walk right in tonight
And tell me there are things that you regret
'Cause if I'm being honest, I ain't over you yet
It's all I'm asking
Is it too much to ask?

[Outro]
It's all I'm asking
Is it too much to ask?
It's all I'm asking
Is it too much to ask?

[Verse 1]
When you feel your love's been taken
When you know there's something missing
In the dark, we're barely hangin' on
Then you rest your head upon my chest
And you feel like there ain't nothin' left
I'm afraid that what we had is gone

[Chorus]
Then I think of the start
And it echoes a spark
And I remember the magic electricity
Then I look in my heart
There's a light in the dark
Still a flicker of hope that you first gave to me
That I wanna keep
Please don't leave
Please don't leave

[Verse 2]
When you lay there and you're sleepin'
Hear the patterns of your breathin'
And I tell you things you've never heard before
Asking questions to the ceilin'
Never knowing what you're thinkin'
I'm afraid that what we had is gone

[Chorus]
Then I think of the start
And it echoes a spark
And I remember the magic electricity
Then I look in my heart
There's a light in the dark
Still a flicker of hope that you first gave to me
That I wanna keep
Please don't leave
Please don't leave

[Bridge]
And I want this to pass
And I hope this won't last
Last too long

[Chorus]
Then I think of the start
And it echoes a spark
And I remember the magic electricity
Then I look in my heart
There's a light in the dark
Still a flicker of hope that you first gave to me
That I wanna keep
Please don't leave
Please don't leave

[Verse 1]
I like the way you talk, I like the things you wear
I want your number tattooed on my arm in ink, I swear
'Cause when the morning comes, I know you won't be there
Every time I turn around, you disappear

[Verse 2]
I wanna blow your mind, just come with me, I swear
I'm gonna take you somewhere warm, you know j'adore la mer
'Cause when the morning comes, I know you won't be there
Every time I turn around, you disappear

[Chorus]


Nice to meet ya



[Refrain]
Nice to meet ya, what's your name?
Let me treat ya to a drink

[Verse 3]
I like the way you talk, I like the things you wear
I want your number tattooed on my arm in ink, I swear
'Cause when the morning comes, I know you won't be there
And every time I turn around, you disappear

[Chorus]


Nice to meet ya



[Bridge]
One minute, you're there, the next one, you're gone
Been waiting for you all night, so come on
You know what I need, you know what I want
You know what I need now
You know what I need now

[Refrain]
Nice to meet ya, what's your name?
Let me treat ya to a drink

[Outro]
Nice to meet ya

Where ya been?

Let me treat ya

To a drink

Nice to meet ya

[Verse 1]
We fight, we get high holdin' on to love
We came down 'cause there was nothingholdin'us
Is it wrongthat I still wonder where youare?
Is it wrong that I still don't know my heart?

[Pre-Chorus]
Are you all dressed up but with nowhere to go?
Are your tears falling down when the lights are low?
Another Friday night tryna put on a show
Do you hate the weekend 'cause nobody's callin'?
I've still got so much love hidden beneath this skin
So, darlin'

[Chorus]
Put a little love on me
Put a little love on me
When the lights come up and there's no shadows dancin'
I look around as my heart is collapsin'
'Cause you're the only one I need
To put a little love on me

[Verse 2]
We wrote and we wrote
'Til there were no more words
We laughed and we cried
Until we saw our worst
Is it wrong that I still wonder where you are?
Is it wrong that I still don't know my heart?

[Pre-Chorus]
Are you all dressed up but with nowhere to go?
Are your tears falling down when the lights are low?
Another Friday night tryna put on a show
Do you hate the weekend 'cause nobody's callin'?
I've still got so much love hidden beneath this skin
Will someone

[Chorus]
Put a little love on me? Ayy
Put a little love on me
When the lights come up and there's no shadows dancin'
I look around as my heart is collapsin'
'Cause you're the only one I need
To put a little love on me

[Bridge]
Last night I lay awake
Stuck on the things we say
And when I close my eyes
The first thing I hear you say is

[Chorus]
Put a little love on me, ayy
Put a little love on me
When the lights come up we're the only ones dancing
I look around and you're standing there asking
You say, "You're the only one I need
So put your love on me"

[Outro]
You're the only one I need
Put your love on me

[Verse 1]
I know what she's like, she's out of her mind
And wraps herself around the truth
She'll jump on that flight and meet you that night
And make you tear up the room

[Pre-Chorus]
She loves when everybody's watching
She knows the way her body moves
She loves the way they all crawl back when she says
That she loves nobody else but you

[Chorus]
She's on the loose 
She's on the loose 
She's on the loose 
She's on the loose 

[Verse 2]
She'll dance in the dark, a real work of art
Her eyes could burn down the room
So get out while you can, you don't understand
She doesn't know how to lose

[Pre-Chorus]
She loves when everybody's watching
She knows the way her body moves
She loves the way they all crawl back when she says
That she loves nobody else but you

[Chorus]
She's on the loose 
She's on the loose 
She's on the loose 
She's on the loose 

[Bridge]
She'll run with your mind and pull you in tight
Then trade you in for something new
I know what it's like, I fell for it twice
And now I'm just warning you

[Pre-Chorus]
She loves when everybody's watching
She knows the way her body moves
She loves the way they all crawl back when she says
That she loves nobody else but you
She loves when everybody's watching
She knows the way her body moves
She loves the way they all crawl back when she says
She loves nobody else but you

[Chorus]
She's on the loose 
She's on the loose 
She's on the loose 
She's on the loose 
She's on the loose
She's on the loose

[Verse 1]
She closed the door
She hides behind the face nobody knows
She feels her skin touch the floor
She wants to fight
Her eyes are tired, nobody's on her side
She wants to feel like she did before

[Pre-Chorus]
She looks into her mirror
Wishing someone could hear her, so loud
And I need love
To hold me closer in the night
Just enough

[Chorus]
I need love
To hold me closer in the night
Just enough to feel my body come alive
When my bones start breaking, my heart starts shaking
I need love, need love

[Verse 2]
The coffee's cold
He turned around and said "I hope you know
You're beautiful, have you ever been told?"
She's a little shy
As he walks away, she slowly breaks a smile
The skies are blue, haven't been for a while

[Pre-Chorus]
She looks into her mirror
Wishing someone could hear her, so loud

[Chorus]
I need love
To hold me closer in the night
Just enough to feel my body come alive
When my bones starts breaking, my heart starts shaking
I need love, need love

[Bridge]
Oh, oh woah
Oh, oh woah
She closed the door
She hides behind the face nobody knows
She feels her skin touch the floor

[Chorus]
I need love
To hold me closer in the night
Just enough to feel my body come alive
When my bones starts breaking, my heart starts shaking
I need love, need love
Oh, oh woa
Oh, oh woa

[Verse 1]
In this house of broken hearts
We made our love out of stacks of cards
And yes, we tried to hold on tight
'Cause we knew our love was hard to find

[Chorus]
And our paper houses reach the stars
'Til we break and scatter worlds apart
Yeah, I paid the price and own the scars
Why did we climb and fall so far?

[Verse 2]
We held our cards, built them high
But way too close to the light
So turn your head and let us go
I learned to breathe on my own

[Chorus]
And our paper houses reach the stars
'Til we break and scatter worlds apart
Yeah, I paid the price and own the scars
Why do we climb and fall so far?

[Bridge]
Yeah, our paper houses reach the stars
'Til we break and scatter worlds apart
I don't wanna lose your touch
I don't wanna hurt this much
I can feel you slipping away

[Chorus]
Yeah, I paid the price and own the scars
Why do we climb and fall so far?

[Outro]
Why do we climb to fall so far?

[Verse 1]
I swear there was lightnin' comin' from your eyes
Startin' a fire in our hotel room
Andyeah,we were dancin',dancin' to Bruno
And I couldn't turnaway from you
Yeah, I saw you smilin', breakin' the silence
Tellin' me just what you want
There in the moment, I was reminded
I haven't felt this way in a while

[Refrain]
Blinded by the sparks
We were drivin' around in the dark
Findin' reasons to stay where we are

[Chorus]
All of my life, I've been sleepwalk livin'
Runnin' around the same bars I've been in
It can be so lonely in this city
But it feels different when you're with me
All of my life, it's been heartbreak weather
Thinkin' to myself, it won't get better
It can be so lonely in this city
But it feels different when you're with me

[Verse 2]
Yeah, it was magic
You were a vision, watchin' the way your body moves
You're takin' your clothes off, you look in the mirror
Tellin' me just what you want

[Refrain]
And I was blinded by the sparks
I was holdin' you close in the dark
Findin' reasons to stay where we are

[Chorus]
All of my life, I've been sleepwalk livin'
Runnin' around the same bars I've been in
It can be so lonely in this city
But it feels different when you're with me
All of my life, it's been heartbreak weather
Thinkin' to myself, it won't get better
It can be so lonely in this city
But it feels different when you're with me

[Bridge]
You, that's what I've been missin'
Was tangled up and twisted
Now, all the clouds been lifted
Lately, my heart's been so empty
You, that's what I've been missin'
Was tangled up and twisted
Now, all the clouds been lifted
Lately, my heart's been so empty

[Chorus]
But it feels different when you're with me
It feels different when you're with me
All of my life, it's been heartbreak weather
Thinkin' to myself, it won't get better
It can be so lonely in this city
But it feels different when you're with me
It feels different when you're with me

[Verse 1]
Everybody's got somebody
I just wanna be alone
Well, I don't need no one
Have too much fun
Out here on my own

[Chorus]
I'll drink 'til it's empty
Stay out 'til it's dead
I'll wake up at midday
And marry my bed
I'll kiss all the women
Get punched in the head
You could offer the world, baby
But I'll take this instead, yeah

[Verse 2]
'Long came the devil, caught my eye
She's kind of my type
Chelsea baby, drives me crazy
Oh, but there's one thing on my mind

[Chorus]
I'll drink 'til it's empty
Stay out 'til it's dead
I'll wake up at midday
And marry my bed
I'll kiss all the women
Get punched in the head
You could offer the world, baby
But I'll take this instead
Yeah, yeah, yeah

[Bridge]
And if you ask me around
And I should decline
Don't take it to heart
Your company's fine
But I get on better with mine

Everybody's got somebody
I just wanna be alone

[Chorus]
I'll drink 'til it's empty
Stay out 'til it's dead
I'll wake up at midday
And marry my bed
I'll kiss all the women
Get punched in the head
You could offer the world, baby
But I'll take this instead, yeah

Well, I'll drink 'til it's empty
Stay out 'til it's dead
I'll wake up at midday
And marry my bed
I'll kiss all the women
Get punched in the head
You could offer the world, baby
But I'll take this instead

[Verse 1]
I've got a young heart
And it's wild and free
I don't know where it starts
But it ends with you and me
It's a hard road
As far as I can see
I don't know where I'm going
But I'll get back to you and me
'Cause we're two kids
Trying to start a fight
No matter where we go
Yeah, we'll be alright
All I'm asking for
A bit of patience, please
'Cause I know what's to come
And it's coming for you and me

[Chorus]
Time has never been on our side
So would you wait for me?
I lead a selfish life
'Cause that's what I need
What do I have to do
To make you believe?
It's all for you and me

[Guitar solo]

[Verse 2]
From a distance
I can hear you cry
But don't you worry, darlin'
Don't lose sleep tonight
I can promise it
I can guarantee
That at the end of the road
I see you with me

[Chorus]
Time has never been on our side
So would you wait for me?
I lead a selfish life
'Cause that's what I need
What do I have to do
To make you believe?
It's all for you and me

[Guitar solo]

[Outro]
When I look down the line
At the man I wanna be
I've always known from the start
That it ends with you and me

[Verse 1]
That first night, we were standin' at your door
Fumblin' for your keys, then I kissedyou
Askme if Iwanna come inside
'Cause we didn't wannaend the night
Then you took my hand and I followed you

[Chorus]
Yeah, I see us in black and white
Crystal clear on a starlit night
In all your gorgeous colours
I promise that I'll love you for the rest of my life
See you standing in your dress
I swear in front of all our friends
There'll never be another
I promise that I'll love you for the rest of my life

[Verse 2]
Now we're sittin' here in your livin' room
Tellin' stories while we share a drink or two
And there's a vision I've been holdin' in my mind
We're sixty-five and you asked
When did I first know, I always knew

[Chorus]
And I see us in black and white
Crystal clear on a starlit night
In all your gorgeous colours
I promise that I'll love you for the rest of my life
See you standing in your dress
I swear in front of all our friends
There'll never be another
I promise that I'll love you for the rest of my life

[Bridge]
And I want the world to witness when we finally say "I do"
It's the way you love, I gotta give it back to you
I can't promise picket fences or sunny afternoons
But at night, when I close my eyes

[Chorus]
I see us in black and white
Crystal clear on a starlit night
There'll never be another
I promise that I'll love you
I see us in black and white
Crystal clear on a starlit night
In all your gorgeous colours
I promise that I'll love you for the rest of my life
See you standing in your dress
I swear in front of all our friends
There'll never be another 
I promise that I'll love you for the rest of my life

[Outro]
And there'll never be another
I promise that I'll love you for the rest of my life

[Verse 1]
Barefoot and a bottle of wine
You can stay with me tonight
You don't have to changewhenI'm around ya
Sogo ahead and say what's onyour mind, on your mind

[Chorus]
When you're with me, no judgement
You can get that from anyone else
You don't have to prove nothin'
You can just be yourself
When you're with me, no judgement
We can get that from everyone else
And we don't have to prove nothin'
When you're with me, no judgement

[Post-Chorus]
Mmm, we don't have to prove nothin'
Mmm, when you're with me, no judgement

[Verse 2]
I get us breakfast in the mornin'
Or you can slip out in the night
You don't have to give me a warnin'
'Cause we both got nothin' to hide, nothin' to hide

[Pre-Chorus]
Even though we don't talk for a couple of months, yeah
It's like we didn't lose any time
I could be your lover or your shoulder to cry on
You can be whoever you like, oh

[Chorus]
When you're with me, no judgement
You can get that from anyone else
You don't have to prove nothin'
You can just be yourself
When you're with me, no judgement
We can get that from everyone else
And we don't have to prove nothin'
When you're with me, no judgement

[Post-Chorus]
Mmm, we don't have to prove nothin'
Mmm, when you're with me, no judgement

[Bridge]
I hope we never change
Even though we both know that we'll move on again
I'll keep your secrets safe
Until the time we both find ourselves alone again, oh

[Chorus]
When you're with me, no judgement 
You can get that from everyone else
You don't have to prove nothin'
You can just be yourself
When you're with me, no judgement 
We can get that from everyone else
And we don't have to prove nothin'
When you're with me, no judgement

[Outro]
Mmm, we don't have to prove nothin'
Mmm , when you're with me, no judgement
Mmm , we don't have to prove nothin'
Mmm, when you're with me, no judgement

[Verse 1]
Like the rain on a sunny day
There's a shadow behind your face
Tell me what you're running from
I don't know what made you so afraid
Don't you know you got the best of me?
Yeah, you're everything I want

[Pre-Chorus]
Anyone can see
Anyone can see
You're hiding, hiding
You can talk to me
It's more than skin-deep
But I'm trying, yeah

[Chorus]
Since we're alone
Yeah, you can show me your heart
If you put it all in my hand
No, I swear
No, I won't break it apart
Since we're alone
Show me all that you are
And if you get lost in the light
It's okay, I can see in the dark

[Verse 2]
All your thoughts running through your head
The things you think better left unsaid
Just wanna know where you came from
Why would you wanna play someone else?
I love you best when you're just yourself
Yeah, you're everything I want

[Pre-Chorus]
Anyone can see
Anyone can see
You're hiding, hiding
You can talk to me
It's more than skin-deep
But I'm trying, yeah

[Chorus]
Since we're alone
Yeah, you can show me your heart
If you put it all in my hand
No, I swear
No, I won't break it apart
Yeah, since we're alone
Show me all that you are
And if you get lost in the light
It's okay, I can see in the dark

[Bridge]
Since we're alone-lone-lone
Alone-lone-lone

Since we're alone-lone-lone
Alone

[Chorus]
Since we're alone
Yeah, you can show me your heart

If you put it all in my hand
No, I swear
No, I won't break it apart

Since we're alone
Show me all that you are

And if you get lost in the light
It's okay, I can see in the dark


[Outro]
Since we're alone-lone-lone
Alone-lone-lone

Since we're alone-lone-lone

Alone

Since we're alone-lone-lone
Alone-lone-lone
Since we're alone-lone-lone
Alone

[Verse 1]
You keep saying that you're alright
But I can see it through your fake smile, you're not
There's a reservoir in your eyes
That you've been holding back a long time, what's wrong?

[Chorus]
Darling, you don't have to hold it
You don't have to be afraid
You can go ahead and unload it
'Cause you know it'll be okay
Fire away
Fire away

[Verse 2]
Hold me close but at a distance
Thinking I don't ever listen, but I do
I know sometimes it gets confusing
You might be lost but I ain't losing you

[Chorus]
Darling, you don't have to hold it
You don't have to be afraid
You can go ahead and unload it
'Cause you know it'll be okay
Fire away, hm
Fire away
Fire away
Fire away

[Outro]
And I will steady your hand
When you're losing your grip
Even if I don't understand
You can talk to me
And I will steady your hand
When you're losing your grip
And even if I don't understand
You can talk to me
Fire away
Fire away
Fire away
Fire away
Fire away

[Verse 1]
My mind is complicated
Find it hard to rearrange it
But I'll have to find a waysomehow
Overreactinglately
Find it hardto say I'm sorry
But I'll makeit up to you somehow
I just don't know why
Stars won't shine at night

[Chorus]
Tell me you want it
A thousand miles away from the day that we started
But I'm standing here with you, just trying to be honest
If honesty means telling you the truth
Well, I'm still in love with you

[Verse 2]
Did I miscalculate this?
Let's just go back to basics
Forget about what's come and gone
'Cause I hate to see us like this
Breaking up on nights just like this
We should be shooting for them stars of gold

[Chorus]
So tell me you want it
A thousand miles away from the day that we started
But I'm standing here with you, just trying to be honest
If honesty means telling you the truth
Then I guess we lost our focus
And it's killing me that we could go to war like this
But I'm standing here with you, just trying to be honest
If honesty means telling you the truth
Well, I'm still in love with you

[Bridge]
Oh, we'll be alright
Oh, it'll be alright
Oh, we'll be alright
Oh, it'll be alright

[Chorus]
So tell me you want it
A thousand miles away from the day that we started
But I'm standing here with you, just trying to be honest
If honesty means telling you the truth
I guess we lost our focus
And it's killing me that we could go to war like this
But I'm standing here with you, just trying to be honest
If honesty means telling you the truth
Well, I'm still in love with you

[Verse 1]
Oh no, get ready
I feel it coming, it's coming again
I stay close, hold steady
'Cause I don't want it, don't want it to end
Those brown eyes, crying in a crowded bar
Every time we get this close
It's always pulling us apart

[Chorus]
Don't let the tide come and wash us away
Don't let the tide come and take me
I just want a safe place to hide us away
So don't let the tide come and take me
Don't let the tide come and wash us away
Don't let the tide come and take me
Far from with you, where I wanna stay
So don't let the tide come and take me

[Verse 2]
Oh no, get ready
I feel it coming, it's coming again
Don't give up, and don't let me
'Cause I'm needing you to understand
When I go, all I ever seem to fear
Is that you're gonna find someone
And slowly watch me disappear

[Chorus]
Don't let the tide come and wash us away
Don't let the tide come and take me
I just want a safe place to hide us away
So don't let the tide come and take me
Don't let the tide come and wash us away
Don't let the tide come and take me
Far from with you, where I wanna stay
So don't let the tide come and take me

[Bridge]
Oh no, get ready
Yeah, I feel it coming, it's coming again
Stay close and hold steady
'Cause I don't want it, don't want it to end
No, no, I don't want it, don't want it to end

[Chorus]
Don't let the tide come and wash us away
Don't let the tide come and take me
I just want a safe place to hide us away
So don't let the tide come and take me
Don't let the tide come and wash us away
Don't let the tide come and take me
Far from with you, where I wanna stay
So don't let the tide come and take me

[Verse 1]
She's been lookin' at me all night
I'm terrified, I know why, baby
She's got the wrongcrazy
Oh,I see themoon in her eyes
I'm paralyzed, she'snot my baby
She's got the wrong crazy

[Pre-Chorus]
Like wolves, we run wild, let passion get too much
Let ourselves get burned by the fire
We're walking on wire, but nothin' feels higher
When I see that look in your eyes

[Chorus]
Tell me what you want because you know I want it too
Let's skip all the small talk and go straight up to your room
I've been thinkin' what I'd do when I'm alone with you
Just say nothin', small talk only gets in the way

[Verse 2]
Turn around, she walkin' to me
I can't believe she's not my baby
Won't someone come see me?
Oh, you see the fool in my mind
Can't run and hide with your stare on me
Look what you're doing to me

[Pre-Chorus]
I wanna run wild, let passion get too much
Let ourselves get burned by the fire
We're walking on wire, but nothin' feels higher
When I see that look in your eyes 

[Chorus]
Tell me what you want because you know I want it too
Let's skip all the small talk and go straight up to your room
I've been thinkin' what I'd do when I'm alone with you
Just say nothin', small talk only gets in the way

[Post-Chorus]
Just say nothing
Oh, oh, small talk
Just say nothing
Oh, no

[Bridge]
Like wolves, we run wild, let passion get too much
Let ourselves get burned by the fire, yeah

[Chorus]
Tell me what you want because you know I want it too
Let's skip all the small talk and go straight up to your room
I've been thinkin' what I'd do when I'm alone with you
Just say nothin', small talk only gets in the way
Tell me what you want because you know I want it too 
Let's skip all the small talk and go straight up to your room 
I've been thinkin' what I'd do when I'm alone with you
Just say nothin', small talk only gets in the way

[Outro]
Just say nothing, oh, oh
Oh, oh, small talk 
Just say nothing 
Oh, no, small talk

[Verse 1]
Looking back through changes where we started from
Don't know about you but I knew it wasn't wrong
You know I kept a place for you in my mind
And I know you did the same 'cause you're just that kind

[Chorus]
So if we knew all along
Why did it take so long?
We've known it since we were young
So why did it take so long?
You know you make me feel loved
Make me feel like I'm home
So if we knew all along
Why did it take so long?

[Verse 2]
Moving on, you and I started looking back
Now we've got to make up for all the wasted time
You know I'd never let you just walk on by
From the day that I met you I knew you'd be mine

[Chorus]
So if we knew all along
Why did it take so long?
We've known since we were young
So why did it take so long?
You know you make me feel loved
Make me feel like I'm home
So if we knew all along
Why did it take so long?

[Bridge]
Just started, just started
I'm having trouble believing it's true
Just started, just started
Now we got nothing to prove

[Chorus]
So if we knew all along
Why did it take so long?
We've known it since we were young
So why did it take so long?
You know you make me feel loved
Make me feel like I'm home
So if we knew all along
Why did it take so long?

[Outro]
Why did it take so long?
Why did it take so long?
Why did it take so long?
Why did it take so long?

[Verse 1]
Dear patience
Can we share a drink and let go of the pressure?
Dear patience
'Cause the lasttimethat we talkedseems like forever
And ever

[Pre-Chorus]
Feels like youdon't even know me
Just me and the stars can get lonely

[Chorus]
Hey, can you show your face?
Can you see that I'm anxious?
Can you hear what I'm saying, saying?
Hey, 'cause I fall too fast
And I go down blazing
Can you hear what I'm saying?

[Verse 2]
Dear patience
If I pour my heart out, can you keep a promise? 
'Cause the situation
Is like a mountain that's been weighing on my conscience
If I'm being honest

[Pre-Chorus]
Feels like you don't even know me 
Just me and the stars can get lonely

[Chorus]
Oh, hey, can you show your face?
Can you see that I'm anxious?
Can you hear what I'm saying, saying?
Hey, 'cause I fall too fast
And I go down blazing
Can you hear what I'm saying?

[Bridge]
The way you make time disappear
I hope that I find you, my dear
The way you make time disappear
I hope that I find you, my dear

[Verse 3]
Patience
Can we share a drink and let go of the pressure? Oh, oh
Dear patience
'Cause the last time that we talked seemed like forever
And ever

[Chorus]
Hey, can you show your face? 
Can you see that I'm anxious?
Can you hear what I'm saying, saying?
Hey, 'cause I fall too fast 
And I go down blazing
Can you hear what I'm saying?

[Outro]
Dear patience

[Verse 1]
Standing here on our own
Yeah, the first step's the hardest when you're walking into the unknown
It's been dark, and it's been cold
Had my head in the clouds never knowing what lies down below

[Pre-Chorus]
Then you spoke your truth with no secrets
Told me use your heart while it's beating

[Chorus]
When you're right here beside me, there's nothing else I need
Your eyes keep me reminded that nothing's out of reach
When you're with me, it feels like I'm finally free
Feels like I'm finally free

[Verse 2]
I didn't know, didn't know what was real
Had to go to the edge and look down just to see how it feels

[Pre-Chorus]
Then you spoke your truth with no secrets
Told me use your heart while it's beating

[Chorus]
When you're right here beside me, there's nothing else I need
Yeah, your eyes keep me reminded that nothing's out of reach
When you're with me, it feels like I'm finally free

Feel's like I'm finally free

[Bridge]
I used to spend the nights looking at the stars
Wondering how to get there, or is it just too far?
I used to spend the nights looking at the stars
Wondering how to get there, or is it just too far?

[Chorus]
But when you're right here beside me there's nothing else I need
Yeah, your eyes keep me reminded that nothing's out of reach
It's easy to believe
When you're with me it feels like I'm finally free
Oh yeah
It feels like I'm finally free

It feels like I'm finally free

[Verse 1]
I never thought that I would find out
We were just lovers in the dark
You've knownsomeonefor a longtime
But you never really know whothey are
It feels like it was only last week
I was trippin' right into your heart
If we're not gonna do this honestly
Baby, won't you give me back what you took apart?

[Pre-Chorus]
When I was on my knees in the darkness
Yeah, you'd be there to break my fall
But now, I'm lyin' here so helpless
But somehow, I just still want more

[Chorus]
You left me with nothing
Now I'm lyin' in the arms of a stranger
But why do I think of you?
You left me with nothing
Now I'm lookin' in the eyes of a stranger
Just tryna get over you
Yeah, you left me with nothing

[Verse 2]
I chase an old love just to feel loved
But it gave me nothin' that was real
No matter what I give, it's not enough
But I guess I'm holdin' onto you still

[Pre-Chorus]
When I was on my knees in the darkness
Yeah, you'd be there to break my fall
But now, I'm lyin' here so helpless
But somehow, I just still want more

[Chorus]
You left me with nothing
Now I'm lyin' in the arms of a stranger
But why do I think of you?
Yeah, you left me with nothing
Now I'm lookin' in the eyes of a stranger
Just tryna get over you
Yeah, you left me with nothing

[Bridge]
Standin' out in the crowd
Nobody can hear me now
I'm tryna get over you
Standin' out in the crowd
If only you could see me now
I'm tryna get over you

[Chorus]
You left me with nothing
And now I'm lyin' in the arms of a stranger
Why do I think of you?
You left me with nothing
And now I'm lookin' in the eyes of a stranger
Just tryna get over you
Yeah, you left me with nothing
You left me with nothing, yeah
You left me with nothing
And now I'm lookin' in the eyes of a stranger
Just tryna get over you
Yeah, you left me with nothing
You left me with nothing

[Verse 1]
It's your world I wanna live in
It's your ocean I wanna swim in
It's your showandI'm just watchin'
Losin'you is not an option

[Pre-Chorus]
If youleave me like a message in a bottle
And you don't come back tomorrow
At least you came tonight
It's easy to pretend that I'm not caught up
But when you get hot and bothered
I can't give up the fight

[Chorus]
Love the way you hurt me
And it doesn't even cross your mind, oh
Tell me that you love me
But I know you're out there runnin' wild, oh
And give me all the pain, give me everything
Don't hold back, don't hold back
Leavin' me in pieces, but I swear it's worth it every time
And it doesn't even cross your mind

[Verse 2]
You keep talkin', I'll just listen
Daydreamin' 'bout where your lips been
Pull my heart right out my chest, drive a train through
Still get up and forgive you

[Pre-Chorus]
If you leave me like a message in a bottle
And you don't come back tomorrow
At least you came tonight
It's easy to pretend that I'm not caught up
But when you get hot and bothered
I can't give up the fight

[Chorus]
Love the way you hurt me
And it doesn't even cross your mind, oh, yeah
Tell me that you love me
But I know you're out there runnin' wild, oh
And give me all the pain, give me everything
Don't hold back, don't hold back
Leavin' me in pieces, but I swear it's worth it every time
And it doesn't even cross your mind

[Bridge]
I want you, there's no lie
I'll love you or die tryin'
I want you, there's no lie
I'll love you or die tryin'
Oh woah, oh, oh, oh I

[Chorus]
Love the way you hurt me
And it doesn't even cross your mind 
Yeah, tell me that you love me
But I know you're out there runnin' wild 
And give me all the pain, give me everything
Don't hold back, don't hold back
Leavin' me in pieces, but I swear it's worth it every time
And it doesn't even cross your mind

[Outro]
Doesn't even cross your mind

[Verse 1]
I just called to say that I miss you, babe
Wonder what you're doin' now
At yourfavouriteplace, you goand list the names
Is there oneyou're leavin' out?

[Chorus]
I'm not sayin' that you're lyin'
But you're leavin' out the truth
And I'm not sayin' that you're guilty
'Cause I don't have any proof
Feelin' like I'm goin' crazy
And I don't know what to do
'Cause on paper, you don't break them
But it hurts so bad the way you bend the rules

[Post-Chorus]
Mmm
The way you bend the rules
Mmm

[Verse 2]
Someone makes you laugh, I can't help but ask
But you won't say what it's about
I pour myself a glass, it won't be the last
Just our medicine for now

[Chorus]
I'm not sayin' that you're lyin'
But you're leavin' out the truth
And I'm not sayin' that you're guilty
'Cause I don't have any proof
Feelin' like I'm goin' crazy
And I don't know what to do
'Cause on paper, you don't break them
But it hurts so bad the way you bend the rules

[Post-Chorus]
Mmm
The way you bend the rules
Mmm
The way you bend the rules

[Chorus]
I'm not sayin' that you're lyin'
But you're leavin' out the truth
And I'm not sayin' that you're guilty
'Cause I don't have any proof
Feelin' like I'm goin' crazy
And I don't know what to do
'Cause on paper, you don't break them
But it's just not fair the way you bend the rules

[Post-Chorus]
Mmm
The way you bend the rules
Mmm
The way you bend the rules
Mmm
The way you bend the rules
Mmm

[Verse 1]
You walk into the room, I go quiet
I catch your eyes and don't blink aneyelid
Feelslike the worldlocked us on an island
An islandwithout waves

[Pre-Chorus]
I try and try to forget you
But your mother thinks I'm the best for you
Try and try to erase you
But you won't disappear

[Chorus]
Feels like every time I turn a corner, you're standin' right there
Over my shoulder, you're everywhere
I swear it's hard to think, it's hard to breathe when you're in the air
I try to run, but you're everywhere I go
When I think I'm all alone
And my heart's under control
Why is lovin' you not fair?
You're everywhere

[Verse 2]
The ground beneath my feet's a bit colder
I see your face in people I don't know
Feels like the world is twistin' in slo-mo
And I'm stuck in one place 

[Pre-Chorus]
I try and try to forget you
But your mother thinks I'm the best for you
I try and try to erase you
But you won't disappear

[Chorus]
Feels like every time I turn a corner, you're standin' right there
Over my shoulder, you're everywhere
I swear it's hard to think, it's hard to breathe when you're in the air
I try to run, but you're everywhere I go
When I think I'm all alone
And my heart's under control
Why is lovin' you not fair?
You're everywhere

[Bridge]
Everywhere
Everywhere I go
But you're still not here
And you're still not here

[Chorus]
Feels like every time I turn a corner, you're standin' right there
I swear it's hard to think, it's hard to breathe when you're in the air
Feels like every time I turn a corner, you're standin' right there
Over my shoulder, you're everywhere 
I swear it's hard to think, it's hard to breathe when you're in the air
I try to run, but you're everywhere I go
When I think I'm all alone 
And my heart's under control 
Why is lovin' you not fair?
You're everywhere
You're everywhere

[Verse 1]
Moon shining, sun rising
You're the one I want to wake up to
Lights fading, I'm changing
Overthinking,Idon't know whatto do

[Pre-Chorus]
I wanna kiss you likethe first time
Hold you like it's not goodbye
Wish I hadn'tbeensocruel
I wanna letall my defensesdown
Scream until you hear me out
I'll lay it on the line for you

[Chorus]
My mind's made up
Take me back, take me back
To San Francisco
I know what we had would never last
Now I can't let go of you
I might show up on your doorstep, soakin' wet
Say I'm done runnin' from the one that I want so bad
Take me back, take me back

[Verse 2]
Drunk dialin', full dive in
Don't you tell me that it's too late now
'Cause I'm pacing, I keep breaking
Is there a way to make it up somehow?

[Pre-Chorus]
I wanna kiss you like the first time
Hold you like it's not goodbye
Before you fall for somebody new
I wanna let all my defences down
Scream until you hear me out
I know that I'll be good to you

[Chorus]
My mind's made up
Take me back, take me back
To San Francisco
I know what we had would never last
Now I can't let go of you
I might show up on your doorstep, soakin' wet
Say I'm done runnin' from the one that I want so bad
Take me back, take me back

[Bridge]
My mind's made up, up, up, up, up
My mind's made up

[Chorus]
And take me back, take me back
To San Francisco
I know what we had could never last
Now I can't let go of you
I might show up on your doorstep, soakin' wet
Say I'm done runnin' from the one that I want so bad
Take me back, take me back

[Outro]
And take me back, take me back
And take me back, take me back
Oh

[Verse 1]
Too many hours in the night
Every second is about her
Every thought is wrapped around her
Toomanyfeelings in thelight
I just need a new distraction
AndI like the way you're dancing

[Pre-Chorus]
I'll give you what's leftofme
'Causeyou feel soheavenly
I don't knowwhat's best for me
But maybe it's time

[Chorus]
I need a new angel
A touch of someone else to save me from myself
I need a new angel
A touch I've never felt, baby, can you tell that
Each time I close my eyes, she's in there running wild
I'm hoping you get her out of my mind
I need a new angel
I need a new angel

[Verse 2]
I think I saw you in my dreams
Didn't know what I've been missing
'Til you walked in like a vision 
You give me something out of reach
Just keep doing what you're doing
'Cause you move me when you're moving

[Chorus]
I need a new angel
A touch of someone else to save me from myself
I need a new angel 
A touch I've never felt, but baby, can't you tell that
Each time I close my eyes, she's in there running wild
I'm hoping you get her out of my mind
I need a new angel
I need a new angel

[Bridge]
I'll give you what's left of me, left of me
'Cause you feel so heavenly, heavenly
I'll give you what's left of me
'Cause you feel so heavenly
I don't know what's best for me
But maybe it's time

[Chorus]
I need a new angel
A touch of someone else to save me from myself
I need a new angel
A touch I've never felt, but baby, can't you tell that
Each time I close my eyes, she's in there running wild
I'm hoping you get her out of my mind
I need a new angel 
I need a new angel
Angel

[Verse 1]
I keep staring at that little white number
You left here in the summer
Hanging in mywardrobe
Doyou still wantit?
Do you still want it?
I knowthat I did you the service
Of calling 'cause I'm nervous
I know that we don't talk
I know that it's on purpose
Do you still want it?

[Pre-Chorus]
But I'm holding on

[Chorus]
Maybe it's time to put your dress away
Or leave it out
Maybe it's time that I give you space
I just wanna see it
Back on your body
Watch you dance around and
Tell you I'm sorry
Maybe it's time to put your dress away
Even if I don't want to, babe

[Verse 2]
I keep staring at that little white number
The one in the picture
When we lose our temper
You'd look at it for hours
But do you still want it?
You smile on the staircase and you open the door
Kissing on the couch
Make up in the drawer
Darling, do you still want it?

[Pre-Chorus]
But I'm holding on

[Chorus]
Maybe it's time to put your dress away
Or leave it out
Maybe it's time that I give you space
I just wanna see it
Back on your body
Watch you dance around and
Tell you I'm sorry
Maybe it's time to put your dress away
Even if I don't want to, babe

[Bridge]
La-la-la-la la la-la la
La-la-la-la la la-la la
La-la-la-la la la-la la
La-la-la-la la la-la la
I know, you know, we both want it, babe
I know, you know, we both want it, babe

[Chorus]
But I just wanna see it
Back on your body
Watch you dance around and
Tell you I'm sorry
Maybe it's time to put your dress away
Even though I don't wanna, babe

[Verse 1]
I'm like a crow on a wire
You're the shining distraction that makes me fly home
I'm like a boat on the water
You're the rays on the waves that calm my mind, oh, every time

[Pre-Chorus]
But I know in my heart, you're not a constant star

[Chorus]
And yeah, I let you use me from the day that we first met
But I'm not done yet, falling for your fool's gold
And I knew that, you turned it on for everyone you met
But I don't regret falling for your fool's gold

[Verse 2]
I'm the first to admit that I'm reckless
I get lost in your beauty and I can't see, two feet in front of me

[Pre-Chorus]
And I know in my heart, you're just a moving part

[Chorus]
And yeah, I let you use me from the day that we first met
But I'm not done yet, falling for your fool's gold
And I knew that, you turned it on for everyone you met
But I don't regret falling for your fool's gold

[Bridge]
But I know your love's not real
That's not the way it feels, that's not the way you feel

[Chorus]
And yeah, I let you use me from the day that we first met
But I'm not done yet, falling for your fool's gold
And I knew that, you turned it on for everyone you met
But I don't regret falling for your fool's gold

[Verse 1]
What holds me
When I'm alone?
What makes the tiger tame?
What turns the sky
From black to gold?
Whatsendsmy tears upin flames?

[Chorus]
Nothing
Nothing
Nothing

[Verse 2]
What moves me like alightning bolt
While praising all my fears?
What breaks me?
Helps me understand
Whatmakesmedisappear?

[Chorus]
Nothing
Nothing
Nothing
Except for yourlove
Nothing
Nothing
Nothing
Except for yourlove

[Verse 3]
What do I, do I really want
In this stormy life?
What choices do I really have
With this heart of mine?

[Chorus]
Nothing
Nothing
Nothing
Except for your love
Nothing
Nothing
Nothing
Except for your love

[Bridge]
Without your love
I'm jaded
Going crazy
Come save me
Heart's beating
Not breathing
I'm breathing

[Verse 4]
What holds me
When I'm alone?
What makes the tiger tame?
What turns the sky
From black to gold?
What sends my tears up in flames?

[Chorus]
Nothing
Nothing
Nothing except for your love
Nothing
Nothing
Nothing except for your love
Nothing
Nothing
Except for your love
Oh!
Nothing
Except for your love

[Intro]

[Verse 1]
Darlin', are you always tryin to blame me?
Is it me or 'cos you came here?
Just accept that time was wrong
Oooh, change thee
I've been thinkin bout it lately
We never finished what we started
Now I'm fearful that it's gone

[Pre-Chorus]
Let's keep this open
There won't be any more hearts that are broken
Hold on, hold on

[Chorus]
Don't leave me wastin' all alone
Wondering where the time has gone
I know it's hard to keep keeping on
Dont leave it wasted

[Verse 2]
Someday, it could be more then we intended
And well be happy that we waited
When it's all been said and done
Oooh, and you have changed me
And we both got what we wanted
And looking back its complicated
But we would've happened all along

[Pre-Chorus]
So keep this open
There won't be any more hearts that are broken
Hold on, hold on

[Chorus]
Don't leave me wastin all alone
Wondering where the time has gone
I know it's hard to keep keeping on
Don't leave me wasted

[Post-Chorus]
Don't leave me wastin' by myself
Let's leave emotions on the shelf
I swear there ain't nobody else
Don't leave me wasted
Don't leave me wasted

[Refrain]
Don't leave me wastin' all alone
Wondering where the time has gone
I know it's hard to keep keeping on
Don't leave me wasted

[Refrain]
Don't leave me wastin' all alone
Wondering where the time has gone
I know it's hard to keep keeping on
Don't leave me wasted

[Outro]
Don't leave me wastin' by myself
Let's leave emotions on the shelf
I swear there ain't nobody else
Don't leave me wasted

[Verse 1]
Esperando aqu por alguien
Tan solo ayer estbamos encaminados
Me sonres de vuelta a mi y tu rostro ilumina el sol
Ahora estoy esperando aqu por alguien

[Pre-Chorus]
Y oh, amor, sientes esto rudo?
Porque eres slo tu en quien pienso?

[Chorus]
Mi sombra est bailando
Sin ti por primera vez
Mi corazn tiene la esperanza
De que t vengas esta noche
Me dices que hay cosas de las que te arrepientes
Porque si te soy sincero, no te he superado an
Es todo lo que estoy pidiendo
Acaso es pedir demasiado? 

[Verse 2]
Alguien se esta moviendo fuera
Las luces se encienden y se apagan en el camino
Olvido que no estas aqu cuando cierro los ojos
An sigues pensando en mi a veces?

[Pre-Chorus]
And oh, love, mira el sol mientras sale
No te sientas jodido, no estamos enamorados

[Chorus]
Mi sombra est bailando
Sin ti por primera vez
Mi corazn tiene la esperanza
De que t vengas esta noche
Me dices que hay cosas de las que te arrepientes
Porque si te soy sincero, no te he superado an
Es todo lo que estoy pidiendo
Acaso es pedir demasiado?

[Bridge]
Mi sombra est bailando
Sin ti por primera vez
Mi corazn tiene la esperanza
De que t vengas esta noche
Me dices que hay cosas de las que te arrepientes
Porque si te soy sincero, no te he superado an

[Chorus]
Mi sombra est bailando
Sin ti por primera vez
Mi corazn tiene la esperanza
De que t vengas esta noche
Me dices que hay cosas de las que te arrepientes
Porque si te soy sincero, no te he superado an
Es todo lo que estoy pidiendo
Acaso es pedir demasiado?

[Outro]
Es todo lo que estoy pidiendo
Acaso es pedir demasiado?
Es todo lo que estoy pidiendo
Acaso es pedir demasiado?

[Verse 1]
When you feel your love's been taken
When you know there's something missing
In the dark, we're barely hangin' on
Then you rest your head upon my chest
And you feel like there ain't nothing left
I'm afraid that what we had is gone

[Chorus]
Then I think of the start
And it echoes a spark
And I remember the magic electricity
Then I look in my heart
There's a light in the dark
Still a flicker of hope that you first gave to me
That I wanna keep
Please don't leave
Please don't leave

[Verse 2]
When you lay there and you're sleeping
Hear the patterns of your breathing
And I tell you things you've never heard before
Asking questions to the ceiling
Never knowing what you're thinking
I'm afraid that what we had is gone

[Chorus]
Then I think of the start
And it echoes a spark
And I remember the magic electricity
Then I look in my heart
There's a light in the dark
Still a flicker of hope that you first gave to me
That I wanna keep
Please don't leave
Please don't leave

[Bridge]
And I want this to pass
And I hope this won't last
Last too long

[Chorus]
Then I think of the start
And it echoes a spark
And I remember the magic electricity
Then I look in my heart
There's a light in the dark
Still a flicker of hope that you first gave to me
That I wanna keep
Please don't leave
Please don't leave

[Verse 1]
Yesterday I thought I saw your shadow running round
It's funny how things never change in this old town
So far... from the stars

[Pre-Chorus]
And I want to tell you everything
The words I never got to say the first time around
And I remember everything
From when we were the children playing in this fairground
Wish I was there with you now
Wish I was there with you now

[Chorus]
If the whole world was watching I'd still dance with you
Drive highways and byways to be there with you
Over and over the only truth
Everything comes back to you

[Verse 2]
I saw that you moved on with someone new
In the pub that we met he's got his arms around you
It's so hard...
So hard

[Pre-Chorus]
And I want to tell you everything
The words I never got to say the first time around
And I remember everything
From when we were the children playing in this fairground
Wish I was there with you now
Wish I was there with you now

[Chorus]
As if the whole world was watching I'd still dance with you
Drive highways and byways to be there with you
Over and over the only truth
Everything comes back to you
Everything comes back to you

[Verse 1: Niall Horan]
We could leave the Christmas lights up 'til January
'Cause this is our house, we maketherules
And there's adazzling haze, a mysterious way aboutyou, dear
Have I known you 20 seconds or 20 years?

[Chorus: Niall Horan]
CanIgowhere you go?
Canwe always bethis close?
Forever and ever, ah
Take me out, and take me home
You're my, my, my, my lover

[Verse 2: FLETCHER]
We could let our friends crash in the living room
This is our place, we make the call
And I'm highly suspicious that everybody who sees you wants you
I've loved you three summers now, honey, but I want 'em all

[Chorus: Niall Horan & FLETCHER]
Can I go where you go?
Can we always be this close?
Forever and ever, ah
Take me out, and take me home
You're my, my, my, my lover

[Bridge: Niall Horan & FLETCHER]
Ladies and gentlemen, will you please stand?
With every guitar string scar on my hand
I take this magnetic force here to be my lover
And my heart's been borrowed and yours has been blue
All's well that ends well to end up with you
Swear to be overdramatic and true to my lover
And you'll save all your dirtiest jokes for me
And at every table  , I'll save you a seat, lover

[Chorus: Niall Horan & FLETCHER]
Can I go where you go?
Can we always be this close?
Forever and ever, and ah
Take me out, and take me home
You're my, my, my, my
Oh, you're my, my, my, my
Darling, you're my, my, my, my lover

[Verse 1]
I know what she's like, she's out of her mind
And wraps herself around the truth
She'll jump on that flight and meet you that night
And make you tear up the room

[Pre-Chorus]
She loves when everybody's watching
She knows the way her body moves
She loves the way they all crawl back when she says
That she loves nobody else but you

[Chorus]
She's on the loose

She's on the loose

She's on the loose

She's on the loose


[Verse 2]
She'll dance in the dark, a real work of art
Her eyes could burn down the room
So get out while you can, you don't understand
She doesn't know how to lose

[Pre-Chorus]
She loves when everybody's watching
She knows the way her body moves
She loves the way they all crawl back when she says
That she loves nobody else but you

[Chorus]
She's on the loose

She's on the loose

She's on the loose

She's on the loose


[Bridge]
She'll run with your mind and pull you in tight
Then trade you in for something new
I know what it's like, I fell for it twice
And now I'm just warning you

[Pre-Chorus]
She loves when everybody's watching
She knows the way her body moves
She loves the way they all crawl back when she says
That she loves nobody else but you

[Chorus]
She's on the loose

She's on the loose

She's on the loose

She's on the loose

She's on the loose
She's on the loose

[Verse 1: Niall Horan]
I have seen, seen it all in paper dreams
Watched it unfold on the screen
But I never understood
I have heard, have heard you speak a million words
Now you're talkin' to me first
I never thought you would

[Chorus: Niall Horan]
Oh, my, my, you just took me by surprise
And I can't believe my eyes
Oh, I must be seein' blind
Oh, no I, you're too good to be all mine
Now I'm lookin' in your eyes
Oh, I must be seein' blind

[Verse 2: Niall Horan]
I was young, my heart was always on the run
But you make lovin' fun
I never knew it could be
Hey, I see you from a different point of view
Feels too good to be true
I found my missin' piece

[Chorus: Niall Horan]
Oh, my, my, you just took me by surprise
And I can't believe my eyes
Oh, I must be seein' blind
Oh, no I, you're too good to be all mine
Now I'm lookin' in your eyes
Oh, I must be seein' blind
Oh, no

[Bridge: Niall Horan]
Oh, my, my
When I look into your eyes
It's a sight I can't describe
Oh, I must be seein' blind

[Chorus: Niall Horan]
Oh, my, my, you just took me by surprise
And I can't believe my eyes
Oh, I must be seein' blind
Oh, no I, you're too good to be all mine
Now I'm lookin' in your eyes
Oh, I must be seein' blind
Oh, I must be seein' blind

[Verse 1]
We should take this back to my place
That's what she said right to my face
'Cause I want you bad
Yeah, I want you, baby
I've been thinking 'bout it all day
And I hope you feel the same way
'Cause I want you bad
Yeah, I want you, baby

[Chorus]
Slow, slow hands
Like sweat dripping down our dirty laundry
No, no chance
That I'm leaving here without you on me
I, I know
Yeah, I already know that there ain't no stopping
Your plans and those
Slow hands
Slow hands

[Verse 2]
I just wanna take my time
We could do this, baby, all night, yeah
'Cause I want you bad
Yeah, I want you, baby

[Chorus]
Slow, slow hands
Like sweat dripping down our dirty laundry
No, no chance
That I'm leaving here without you on me
I, I know
Yeah, I already know that there ain't no stopping
Your plans and those
Slow hands

[Bridge]
Fingertips puttin' on a show
Got me now and I can't say no
Wanna be with you all alone
Take me home, take me home
Fingertips puttin' on a show
Can't you tell that I want you, baby, yeah

[Chorus]
Slow hands
Like sweat dripping down our dirty laundry
No, no chance
That I'm leaving here without you on me
I, I know
Yeah, I already know that there ain't no stopping
Your plans and those slow hands

[Verse 1]
Deberamos seguir con esto en mi casa
Eso fue lo que ella me dijo directamente a la cara
Porque te deseo tanto
S, te deseo bebe
He estado pensando en ello todo el da
Y espero que tu te sientas del mismo modo
Porque te deseo tanto
S, te deseo bebe

[Chorus]
Lentas, manos lentas
Como el sudor goteando por nuestra ropa sucia
No, no hay ninguna posibilidad
De que me vaya de aqu sin ti encima mo
Yo, yo se
Se que no hay forma de parar
Tus planes, y esas
Manos lentas
Manos lentas

[Verse 2]
Yo solo quiero tomarme mi tiempo
Podramos hacer esto toda la noche bebe
Porque te deseo tanto
S, te deseo bebe

[Chorus]
Lentas, manos lentas
Como el sudor goteando por nuestra ropa sucia
No, no hay ninguna posibilidad
De que me vaya de aqu sin ti encima mo
Yo, yo se
Se que no hay forma de parar
Tus planes, y esas
Manos lentas

[Bridge]
Las puntas de los dedos hacen un espectculo
Me tienes ahora y no puedo decir "no"
Quiero estar contigo a solas
Llvame a casa, llvame a casa
Las puntas de los dedos hacen un espectculo
Acaso no ves que te deseo, bebe?

[Chorus]
Manos lentas
Como el sudor goteando por nuestra ropa sucia
No, no hay ninguna posibilidad
De que me vaya de aqu sin ti encima mo
Yo, yo se
Se que no hay forma de parar
Manos lentas
Como el sudor goteando por nuestra ropa sucia
No, no hay ninguna posibilidad
De que me vaya de aqu sin ti encima mo
Yo, yo se
Se que no hay forma de parar
Aquellas manos lentas
Manos lentas[Produced by Max Martin]

[Verse 1]
You're the light, you're the night
You're the colour of my blood
You're the cure, you're the pain
You're the only thing I wanna touch
Never knew that it could mean so much, so much

[Verse 2]
You're the fear, I don't care
Cause I've never been so high
Follow me through the dark
Let me take you past the satellites
You can see the world you brought to life, to life

[Chorus]
So love me like you do, la-la-love me like you do
Love me like you do, la-la-love me like you do
Touch me like you do, ta-ta-touch me like you do
What are you waiting for?

[Verse 3]
Fading in, fading out
On the edge of paradise
Every inch of your skin is a Holy Grail I've got to find
Only you can set my heart on fire, on fire
Yeah

[Bridge]
I'll let you set the pace
Cause I'm not thinking straight
My head's spinning around, I can't see clear no more
What are you waiting for?

[Chorus]
Love me like you do, la-la-love me like you do
Love me like you do, la-la-love me like you do
Touch me like you do, ta-ta-touch me like you do
What are you waiting for?
Love me like you do, la-la-love me like you do
Love me like you do, la-la-love me like you do
Touch me like you do, ta-ta-touch me like you do
What are you waiting for?

What are you waiting for?

[Intro]
Oh, oh
Uh-oh-oh-oh
Eh

[Verse 1]
It's a little blurry how the whole thing started
I don't even really know what you intended
Thought that you were cute and you could make me jealous
Poured it down, so I poured it down
Next thing that I know I'm in a hotel with you
You were talking deep like it was mad love to you
You wanted my heart but I just liked your tattoos
Poured it down, so I poured it down

[Pre-Chorus 1]
And now I don't understand it
You don't mess with love, you mess with the truth
And I know I shouldn't say it
But my heart don't understand

[Chorus 1]
Why I got you on my mind
Why I got you on my mind
Why I got you on my mind
Why I got you on my mind
But my heart don't understand
Why I got you on my mind
Why I got you on my mind
Why I got you on my mind
Why I got you on my mind

[Verse 2]
I always hear, always hear them talking
Talking 'bout a girl, 'bout a girl with my name
Saying that I hurt you but I still don't get it
You didn't love me, no, not really
Wait
I could have really liked you
I'll bet, I'll bet that's why I keep on thinking 'bout you
It's a shame , you said I was good
So I poured it down, so I poured it down

[Pre-Chorus 1]
And now I don't understand it
You don't mess with love, you mess with the truth
And I know I shouldn't say it
But my heart don't understand

[Chorus 2]
Why I got you on my mind
Why I got you on my mind
Why I got you on my mind
Why I got you on my mind
But my heart don't understand
Why I got you on my mind
You think you know somebody
Why I got you on my mind
You think you know somebody
Why I got you on my mind
You think you know somebody
Why I got you on my mi-i-i-i-ind

[Bridge]
You got yourself in a dangerous zone
Cause we both have the fear, fear of being alone

[Pre-Chorus 2]
And I still don't understand it
You don't mess with love, you mess with the truth
And my heart don't understand it
Understand it, understand it

[Chorus 3]
Why I got you on my mind
You think you know somebody
Why I got you on my mind
You think you know somebody
Why I got you on my mind
You think you know somebody
Why I got you on my mind
But my heart don't understand
Why I got you on my mind
You think you know somebody
Why I got you on my mind
You think you know somebody
Why I got you on my mind
You think you know somebody
Why I got you on my mind
But my heart don't understand
Why I got you on my mind
You think you know somebody
Why I got you on my mind
You think you know somebody
Why I got you on my mind
You think you know somebody
Why I got you on my mind

[Outro]
Uh, uh, uh, uh

[Verse 1]
We, we don't have to worry 'bout nothing
'Cause we got the fire
And we're burning one hell of a something
They, they gonna see us from outer space
Outer space, light it up
Like we're the stars of the human race, human race

[Chorus]
When the lights turned down, they don't know what they heard
Strike the match, play it loud, giving love to the world
We'll be raising our hands, shining up to the sky
'Cause we got the fire, fire, fire
Yeah, we got the fire, fire, fire
And we gonna let it burn, burn, burn, burn
We gonna let it burn, burn, burn, burn
Gonna let it burn, burn, burn, burn
We gonna let it burn, burn, burn, burn

[Verse 2]
We don't wanna leave
No, we just wanna be right now, right, ri-ri-right now
And what we see, is everybody's on the floor
Acting crazy, getting loco 'til the light's out
Music's on, I'm waking up
We start the fire, and we burn it up
And it's over now, we got the love
There's no sleeping now, no sleeping now, sleeping now

[Chorus]
When the lights turned down, they don't know what they heard
Strike the match, play it loud, giving love to the world
We'll be raising our hands, shining up to the sky
'Cause we got the fire, fire, fire
Yeah, we got the fire, fire, fire
And we gonna let it burn, burn, burn, burn
We gonna let it burn, burn, burn, burn
Gonna let it burn, burn, burn, burn
We gonna let it burn, burn, burn, burn

[Bridge 1]
When the lights turned down, they don't know what they heard
Strike the match, play it loud, giving love to the world
We gonna let it burn, burn, burn, burn, burn, burn 
Burn, burn, burn, burn, burn, burn 

[Bridge 2]
We can light it up, up, up
So they can't put it out, out, out
We can light it up, up, up
So they can't put it out, out, out
We can light it up, up, up
So they can't put it out, out, out
We can light it up, up, up
So they can't put it out, out, out

[Chorus]
When the lights turned down, they don't know what they heard
Strike the match, play it loud, giving love to the world
We'll be raising our hands, shining up to the sky
'Cause we got the fire, fire, fire
Yeah, we got the fire, fire, fire
And we gonna let it burn, burn, burn, burn
We gonna let it burn, burn, burn, burn
Gonna let it burn, burn, burn, burn
We gonna let it burn, burn, burn, burn 

[Outro]
When the lights turned down, they don't know what they heard
Strike the match, play it loud, giving love to the world
We'll be raising our hands, shining up to the sky 
'Cause we got the fire, fire, fire
Yeah, we got the fire, fire, fire
And we're gonna let it burn

[Verse 1]
Fire and ice
This love is like fire and ice
This love is like rain and blue skies
This love is like sun on the rise
This love got me rolling the dice
Don't let me lose
Still falling for you
Still falling for you
Beautiful mind
Your heart got a story with mine
Your heart got me hurting at times
Your heart gave me new kind of highs
Your heart got me feeling so fine
So what to do
Still falling for you
Still falling for you

[Pre-Chorus]
It took us a while
With every breath a new day
With love on the line
We've had our share of mistakes
But all your flaws and scars are mine
Still falling for you
Still falling for you

[Chorus]
And just like that
All I breathe
All I feel
You are all for me
I'm in
And just like that
All I breathe
All I feel
You are all for me
No one can lift me, catch me the way that you do
I'm still falling for you

[Verse 2]
Brighter than gold
This love shining brighter than gold
This love is like letters in bold
This love is like out of control
This love is never growing old
You make it new
Still falling for you
Still falling for you

[Pre-Chorus]
It took us a while
Because we were young and unsure
With love on the line
What if we both would need more
But all your flaws and scars are mine
Still falling for you
Still falling for you
Still falling for you

[Chorus]
And just like that
All I breathe
All I feel
You are all for me
I'm in
And just like that
All I breathe
All I feel
You are all for me
No one can lift me, catch me the way that you do
I'm still falling for you

[Bridge]
Falling, crash into my arms
Love you like this
Like a first kiss
Never let go
Falling, crash into my arms
Never breaking what we got
Still falling for you
Still falling for ...

[Chorus]
And just like that
All I breathe
All I feel
You are all for me
Im in
And just like that
All I breathe
All I feel
You are all for me
All for me

And just like that
All I feel is you
All I feel is you
You are all for me
Im still falling ...
And just like that
All I feel is you
All I feel is you
You are all for me
No one can lift me, catch me the way that you do
Im still falling for you

[Verse 1]
I had a way then
Losing it all on my own
I had a heart then
But the queen has been overthrown
And I'm not sleeping now
The dark is too hard to beat
And I'm not keeping up
The strength I need to push me

[Chorus]
You show the lights that stop me turn to stone
You shine it when I'm alone
And so I tell myself that I'll be strong
And dreaming when they're gone
Cause they're calling, calling, calling me home
Calling, calling, calling home
You show the lights that stop me turn to stone
You shine it when I'm alone

[Verse 2]
Noises, I play within my head
Touch my own skin
And hope that I'm still breathing
And I think back to when
My brother and my sister slept
In an unlocked place
The only time I feel safe

[Chorus]
You show the lights that stop me turn to stone
You shine it when I'm alone
And so I tell myself that I'll be strong
And dreaming when they're gone
Cause they're calling, calling, calling me home
Calling, calling, calling home
You show the lights that stop me turn to stone
You shine it when I'm alone

[Post-Chorus]
Home, home
Home, home

[Chorus]
You show the lights that stop me turn to stone
You shine it when I'm alone
And so I tell myself that I'll be strong
And dreaming when they're gone
Cause they're calling, calling, calling me home
Calling, calling, calling home
You show the lights that stop me turn to stone
You shine it when I'm alone

[Post-Chorus]
Home, home
Home, home[Produced by Max Martin]

[Verse 1]
I know that I've been messed up
You never let me give up
All the nights and the fights
And the blood and the breakups
You're always there to call up
I'm a pain, I'm a child, I'm afraid
But yeah, you understand
Yeah like no one can
I know that we don't look like much
But no one fucks it up like us

[Verse 2]
16 and you never even judged me
Matter of fact I always thought you were too cool for me
Sitting there in the caravan
All the nights we've been drunk on the floor
And yeah you understand
Yeah like no one can
We both know what they say about us
But they don't stand a chance because

[Chorus]
When I'm with you
When I'm with you
I'm standing with an army
I'm standing with an army
When I'm with you
When I'm with you
I'm standing with an army
Standing with an army

[Verse 3]
Dark times, you can always find the bright side
I'm amazed by the things that you would sacrifice
Just to be there for me
How you cringe when you sing out of tune
And yeah it's everything
So don't change a thing
We both know what they say about us
But they don't stand a chance because

[Chorus]
When I'm with you
When I'm with you
I'm standing with an army
I'm standing with an army
When I'm with you
When I'm with you
I'm standing with an army
Standing with an army

[Refrain]
Standing with an army
Standing with an army
Standing with an army
Standing with an army

Standing with an army
Standing with an army
I'm standing with an army

[Bridge]
Yeah you understand
Yeah like no one can
We both know what they say about us

[Chorus]
When I'm with you
When I'm with you
I'm standing with an army
I'm standing with an army
When I'm with you
When I'm with you
I'm standing with an army
They don't have a chance either

[Outro]
Standing with an army
Standing with an army
Standing with an army
Standing with an army
Standing with an army
Standing with an army
Standing near you
Standing with an army
Standing with an army
Standing with an army
Standing with an army
Standing with an army
Standing with an army
When I'm with you
Standing with an army

[Verse 1]
Stripped to the waist we fall into the river
Cover your eyes so you don't know the secret
I've been trying to hide
We held our breath to see our names are written
On the wreck of '86
That was the year I knew the panic was over

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Yes, since we found out
Since we found out

[Hook]
That anything could happen
Anything could happen
Anything could happen
Anything could happen
Anything could happen
Anything could happen
Anything could

[Verse 2]
After the war, we said we'd fight together
I guess we thought that's just what humans do
Letting darkness grow
As if we need its palette and we need its color

[Pre-Chorus 2]
But now I've seen it through
And now I know the truth

[Hook]
That anything could happen
Anything could happen
Anything could happen
Anything could happen
Anything could happen
Anything could happen
Anything could

[Bridge 1]
Baby, I'll give you everything you need
I'll give you everything you need, oh
I'll give you everything you need
But I don't think I need you

[Chorus]
Stripped to the waist we fall into the river
Cover your eyes so you don't know the secret
I've been trying to hide
We held our breath to see our names are written
On the wreck of '86
That was the year I knew the panic was over

[Hook]
That anything could happen
Anything could happen
Anything could happen
Anything could happen
Anything could happen
Anything could happen
Anything could

[Bridge 2]
I know it's going to be
I know it's going to be
I know it's going to be
I know it's going to be
I know it's going to be
I know it's going to be
I know it's going to be
I know it's going to be, oh

[Outro]
But I don't think I need you
But I don't think I need you
But I don't think I need you
But I don't think I need youHow long will I love you
As long as stars are above you
And longer if I can
How long will I need you
As long as the seasons need to
Follow their plan

How long will I be with you
As long as the sea is bound to
Wash up on the sand

How long will I want you
As long as you want me to
And longer by far
How long will I hold you
As long as your father told you
As long as you can

How long will I give to you
As long as I live through you
However long you say

How long will I love you
As long as stars are above you
And longer if I may

[Spoken]
We're all traveling through time together
Every day of our lives
All we can do is do our best
To relish this remarkable ride

[Verse 1]
Remember me in a simple way, not what I did or said
When I think of you now, I just think of the day we met
Don't forget me, like I didn't care
Yeah, I stole from myself just to make you complete

[Pre-Chorus]

I don't think you have the patience
I don't think you know the difference

And I don't want cute imitations
I know you wanted to save me

[Chorus]
And I'm still in love with the idea of loving you
It's a state of flux, but it's not enough
And I'm still in love with the idea of loving you
It's a state of flux, I just keep holding on

[Post-Chorus]
Would you be taking me higher?
Would we be living as liars?
I wanna know, I wanna know

[Verse 2]
When the memories pack up and leave, it will set me free
All those days on the beach will be washing away from me
I will keep you secretly just to keep the peace
Keep steering this ship through the dark and the stormy seas

[Pre-Chorus]

I should be counting my blessings
Staying safe in confusion

And maybe I'm learning my lesson
I know you wanted to save me

[Chorus]
I'm still in love with the idea of loving you
It's a state of flux, but it's not enough
And I'm still in love with the idea of loving you
It's a state of flux, I just keep holding on

[Post-Chorus]
Would you be taking me higher?
Would we be living as liars?
I wanna know, I wanna know
Would we be living in Camden?
Getting a ticket to your band?
I wanna know, I wanna know

[Bridge]
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh

[Chorus]
Oh, I'm still in love with the idea of loving you 
It's a state of flux 
But it's not enough 
I'm still in love with the idea of loving you
It's a state of flux, I just keep holding on

I'm still in love with the idea of loving you
It's a state of flux, but it's not enough 
I'm still in love with the idea of loving you
It's a state of flux, I just keep holding on

[Verse 1]
Do you remember when we moved out?
My mum said, "I love you, but it's a small house"
So we changed up and saved up
Gave up our town
We were dangerous, couldn't tame us
What's missing now?

[Pre-Chorus]
Time
Suddenly, we got no time
We're so busy doing life
That I miss your eyes on mine, mine

[Chorus]
If you just focus on me
Like we were sixteen
And plotting our lives
Can I wear your t-shirt
And sleep on you
While I dream of all the good times?
When we were sixteen

[Post-Chorus]
Like we were sixteen
Like we were sixteen

[Verse 2]
Do you remember the teacher said
"You're too young, too stupid, don't lose your head"
But years gone and we held on with the best intent
Just two kids who kicked it on MSN

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, time
Suddenly, we got no time
We're so busy doing life
That I miss your eyes on mine, mine

[Chorus]
Oh, if you just focus on me
Like we were sixteen
And plotting our lives 
Can I wear your t-shirt
And sleep on you
While I dream of all the good times?
When we were sixteen

[Post-Chorus]
Like we were sixteen
Like we were sixteen

[Bridge]
Let's take the love that we found
And give it back to ourselves
Sometimes these things don't work out
Sometimes there'll be no one else
They said we'd never even make it this far
But here we are
And we're still counting stars
Like we were sixteen

[Outro]
Oh, when we were sixteen
We're still counting stars like we were sixteen
We're still counting stars like we were sixteen

[Verse 1]
It's the strangest feeling
Feeling this way for you
There's something in the way you move
Something in the way you move
With you Im never healing
Its heartache through and through
There's something in the way you move
I dont know what it is you do
Not one bone in your body good enough for me
But this heart is open, bloodstain on my sleeve
When our eyes meet, I can only see the end
But tonight I'm here, yours again

[Pre-Chorus]
But tonight I'm gonna lose it all
Playing with fire, I was the first to fall
Heart is sinking like a cannonball
Baby, kill it, what you waiting for?

[Chorus]
Something in the way you move
There's something in the way you do it
Something in the way you move
Oh
There's something in the way you move
Something in the way you do it
Something in the way you move
Oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

[Verse 2]
There's an evil night air, the stars don't shine tonight, 
There's something in the way you do
There's something in the way you
Push me closer, further
Break me just enough
Your lies always seem so true
There's nothing  left for me to lose
There's not one thing I can do to change your ways
But I can't sit back and take the lonely days
When our eyes meet, I can only see the end
And tonight the rain pours again

[Pre-Chorus]
But tonight I'm gonna lose it all
Playing with fire, I was the first to fall
Heart is sinking like a cannonball
Baby, kill it, what you waiting for?

[Chorus]
Something in the way you move
There's something in the way you do it
Something in the way you move
Oh
There's something in the way you move
Something in the way you do it
Something in the way you move
Oh

[Instrumental Bridge]
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

[Pre-Chorus]
But tonight I'm gonna lose it all
Playing with fire, I was the first to fall
Heart is sinking like a cannonball
Baby, kill it, what you waiting for?

[Chorus]
Something in the way you move
There's something in the way you do it
Something in the way you move
Oh
There's something in the way you move
Something in the way you do it
Something in the way you move
Oh

[Verse 1: Ellie Goulding]
You know we can get away
Because I'm calling your name
Every day I feel this pain
But you just turn and walk away

[Chorus: Ellie Goulding]
No, I just can't keep hanging on
To you and me
I just don't know what is wrong
With you and me

[Verse 2: Ellie Goulding]
Touch me and then turn away
And put your hands into the flame
Tell me if you feel this pain
Cause I don't wanna be a ball and chain

[Chorus: Ellie Goulding]
No, I just can't keep hanging on
To you and...
I just don't know what is wrong

[Verse 3: Tinie Tempah]
Yeah, give me that respect, forgive me and forget
You've got to get a grip, living on the edge
I barely even know this fucking woman in my bed
And if there is too much on my plate then I ain't finishing my veg
And if anybody said the grass is greener on the other side
Well it ain't, swear on my mother's life
You got me wrapped up in your shit, I'm feeling mummified
I've only ever had this fucking feeling in my stomach twice
You gave me what I needed and I gave her everything she wanted
There's something 'bout your cleavage, now I can't put my fingers on it
Been taking me the deepest, I thought that she was gonna vomit
If all women are from Venus then I guess I really got a rocket
You've got a noose around my neck but I'm still hanging on
We've nearly reached the finish line up in our marathon
I spat a verse, she sang a song
She broke my heart, I took some Gaviscon

[Outro: Ellie Goulding]
I just can't keep hanging on
To you and me
With you and me
With you and

[Verse 1]
Eyes make their peace in difficulties
With wounded lips and salted cheeks
And finally, we step to leave
To the departure lounge of disbelief

[Pre-Chorus]
And I don't know where I'm going
But I know it's gonna be a long time
And I'll be leaving in the morning
Come the white wine, bitter sunlight

[Chorus]
Wanna hear your beating heart tonight
Before the bleeding sun comes alive
I want to make the best of what is left, hold tight
And hear my beating heart one last time
Before daylight

[Verse 2]
And the canyon underneath the trees
Behind the dark sky, you looked at me
I fell for you, like autumn leaves
Never faded, evergreen

[Pre-Chorus]
And I don't know where I'm going
But I know it's gonna be a long time
Cause I'll be leaving in the morning
Come the white wine, bitter sunlight

[Chorus]
Wanna hear your beating heart tonight
Before the bleeding sun comes alive
I want to make the best of what is left, hold tight
And hear my beating heart one last time

[Bridge]
I can't face this, now everything has changed
I just wanna be by your side
Here's hoping we collide
Here's hoping we collide
Here's hoping we collide

[Chorus]
Wanna hear your beating heart tonight
Before the bleeding sun comes alive
I want to make the best of what is left, hold tight
And hear my beating heart one last time

[Outro]
Wanna hear your beating heart, tonight

[Verse 1]
Starry, starry night
Paint your palette blue and grey
Look out on a summer's day
With eyes that know the darkness in my soul
Shadows on the hills
Sketch the trees and the daffodils
Catch the breeze and the winter chills
In colors on the snowy linen land

[Chorus]
Now I understand
What you tried to say to me
And how you suffered for your sanity
How you tried to set them free
They would not listen, they did not know how
Perhaps they'll listen now

[Verse 2]
Starry, starry night
Flaming flowers that brightly blaze
Swirling clouds in a violet haze
Reflect in Vincent's eyes of china blue
Colors changing hue
Morning fields of amber grain
Weathered faces lined in pain
Are soothed beneath the artist's loving hand

[Chorus]
Now I understand
What you tried to say to me
And how you suffered for your sanity
And how you tried to set them free
They would not listen, they did not know how
Perhaps they'll listen now

[Bridge]
For they could not love you
But still your love was true
And when no hope was left in sight
On that starry, starry night
You took your life, as lovers often do
But I could've told you, Vincent
This world was never meant for one as beautiful as you

[Verse 3]
Starry, starry night
Portraits hung in empty halls
Frameless heads on nameless walls
With eyes that watch the world and can't forget
Like the strangers that you've met
The ragged men in their ragged clothes
The silver thorn of bloody rose
Lie crushed and broken on the virgin snow

[Outro]
Now I think I know
What you tried to say to me
And how you suffered for your sanity
And how you tried to set them free
They would not listen, they're not listening still
Perhaps they never will

[Verse 1]
You trembled like you'd seen a ghost
And I gave in
I lacked the things you need the most
You said, "Where have you been?"
You wasted all that sweetness to run and hide
I wonder why
I remind you of the days you poured your heart into
But you never tried
I've fallen from grace
Took a blow to my face
I've loved and I've lost
I've loved and I've lost

[Chorus]
Explosions on the day you wake up
Needing somebody and you've learned
It's okay to be afraid
But it will never be the same
It will never be the same

[Verse 2]
You left my soul bleeding in the dark
So you could be king, ah
The rules you set are still untold to me
And I've lost my faith in everything
The nights you could cope
Your intentions were gold
But the mountains will shake
I need to know I can still make

[Chorus]
Explosions on the day you wake up
Needing somebody and you've learned
It's okay to be afraid
But it will never be the same
It will never be the same

[Bridge]
And as the floods move in
And your body starts to sink
I was the last thing on your mind
I know you better than you think
Because it's simple, darling, I gave you a warning
Now everything you own is falling from the sky in pieces
So watch them fall with you, in slow motion
I pray that you will find peace of mind
And I'll find you another time
I'll love you, another time

[Chorus]
Explosions on the day you wake up
Needing somebody and you've learned
It's okay to be afraid
But it will never be the same
It will never be the same

[Verse 1]
You're the light, you're the night
You're the colour of my blood
You're the cure, you're the pain
You're the only thing I wanna touch
Never knew that it could mean so much, so much
You're the fear, I don't care
Cause I've never been so high
Follow me through the dark
Let me take you past the satellites
You can see the world you brought to life, to life

[Chorus]
So love me like you do, la-la-love me like you do
Love me like you do, la-la-love me like you do
Touch me like you do, ta-ta-touch me like you do
What are you waiting for?

[Verse 2]
Fading in, fading out, on the edge of paradise
Every inch of your skin is a Holy Grail I've got to find
Only you can set my heart on fire, on fire, yeah
I'll let you set the pace
Cause I'm not thinking straight
My head's spinning around, I can't see clear no more
What are you waiting for?

[Chorus]
Love me like you do, la-la-love me like you do 
Love me like you do, la-la-love me like you do
Touch me like you do, ta-ta-touch me like you do
What are you waiting for?
Love me like you do, la-la-love me like you do 
Love me like you do, la-la-love me like you do 
Touch me like you do, ta-ta-touch me like you do 
What are you waiting for?

[Bridge]
I'll let you set the pace
Cause I'm not thinking straight
My head's spinning around, I can't see clear no more
What are you waiting for?

[Chorus]
Love me like you do, la-la-love me like you do 
Love me like you do, la-la-love me like you do 
Touch me like you do, ta-ta-touch me like you do 
What are you waiting for?
Love me like you do, la-la-love me like you do 
Love me like you do, la-la-love me like you do 
Touch me like you do, ta-ta-touch me like you do
What are you waiting for?

[Verse 1]
That feeling that doesn't go away just did
And I walked a thousand miles to prove it
And I'm caught in the crossfire of my own thoughts
The color of my blood is all I see on the rocks
As you sail from me

[Pre-Chorus]
Alarms will ring for eternity
The waves will break every chain on me
My bones will bleach
My flesh will flee
So help my lifeless frame to breathe

[Chorus]
And God knows, I'm not dying but I bleed now
And God knows, it's the only way to heal now
With all the blood I lost with you
It drowns the love I thought I knew

[Verse 2]
The lost dreams are buried in my sleep for him
And this was the ecstasy of a love forgotten
And I'm thrown in the gunfire of empty bullets
And my blood is all I see
As you steal my soul from me

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Alarms will ring for eternity
The waves will break every chain on me

[Chorus]
And God knows, I'm not dying but I bleed now
And God knows, it's the only way to heal now
With all the blood I lost with you
It drowns the love I thought I knew

[Instrumental Bridge]

[Chorus]
And God knows, I'm not dying but I bleed now
And God knows, it's the only way to heal now
With all the blood I lost with you
It drowns the love I thought I knew
And God knows, I'm not dying but I bleed now
And God knows, it's the only way to heal now
With all the blood I lost with you

It drowns the love I thought I knew
[Verse 1]
Breathe your smoke into my lungs
In the back of the car with you I stare into the sun
Still not too old to die young
But lovers hold on to everything
And lovers hold on to anything

[Hook]
I chased your love around a figure 8
I need you more than I can take
You promise forever and a day
And then you take it all away


[Verse 2]
Place a kiss on my cheekbone
Then you vanish me, I'm buried in the snow
But something tells me I'm not alone
But lovers hold on to everything
And lovers hold on to anything

[Hook]
I chased your love around a figure 8
I need you more than I can take
You promise forever and a day
And then you take it all away


[Bridge]
So lovers hold on to everything
And lovers hold to anything
So lovers hold on to everything
And lovers hold to anything

[Hook]
I chased your love around a figure 8
I need you more than I can take
You promise forever and a day
And then you take it all away
[Verse 1]
I lost a signal and put you away
Swore upon my sun I'd save you for a rainy day
Loosen the noose then let go of the rope
I know if it's never coming back it has to go

[Pre-Chorus]
I keep calling your name 
I wanna hold you close but I never wanna feel ashamed
So I keep calling at night 
I wanna hold you close I just never wanna hold you tight

[Chorus]
Goodness gracious I can't seem to stop
Calling it off
Calling it off just to keep crawling to your arms
Goodness gracious I can't seem to stop
Calling it off
Calling it off just to keep crawling to your arms

[Verse 2]
I found the weakness and put it to play
Swore upon the stars I'd keep you till the night is day
Shake my head dizzy so I'll never know
You said if you're never coming back you have to go

[Pre-Chorus]
I keep calling your name 
I wanna hold you close but I never wanna feel ashamed
So I keep calling at night 
I wanna hold you close I just never wanna hold you tight

[Chorus]
Goodness gracious I can't seem to stop
Calling it off
Calling it off just to keep crawling to your arms
Goodness gracious I can't seem to stop
Calling it off
Calling it off just to keep crawling to your arms

[Bridge]
Calling you up just to keep crawling to your arms
Oh my goodness, here I go again
Pulling you back to me
Pulling you back into my arms so selfishly
I don't think I understand cause I don't really know myself
I keep calling you up, calling you up
Calling you up, calling you up, calling you up

[Chorus]
Goodness gracious I can't seem to stop
Calling it off
Calling it off just to keep crawling to your arms
Goodness gracious I can't seem to stop
Calling it off
Calling it off just to keep crawling to your arms

[Verse 1]
It's a little bit funny
This feeling inside
I'm not one of those who can easily hide
I don't have much money
But boy if I did
I'd buy a big house where
We both could live

So excuse me forgetting
But these things I do
See I've forgotten if
They're green or they're blue
Anyway the thing is
What I really mean
Yours are the sweetest eyes I've ever seen

[Chorus]
And you can tell everybody
This is your song
It may be quite simple but
Now that it's done
I hope you don't mind, I hope you don't mind
That I put down in words
How wonderful life is now you're in the world

[Verse 2]
If I was a sculptor
But then again no
Or girl who makes potions in a traveling show
I know it's not much but
It's the best I can do
My gift is my song and
This one's for you

Ohh

[Chorus]
And you can tell everybody
This is your song
It may be quite simple but
Now that it's done
I hope you don't mind, I hope you don't mind
That I put down in words
How wonderful life is now you're in the world

[Verse 1]
I've been too numb to understand
I'm just a victim of the weapon in my hand
So many casualties of love
But I've been bulletproof, I'm staring at the sun

[Pre-Chorus]
I was the one you took home
Never a flame to burn slow
But I was hoping you'd see me a different way
So many bodies I've touched
Crushing around me like dust
You are the realest thing I've never had to fake

[Chorus]
I don't need nobody, need nobody but
I don't need nobody, need nobody but you
I don't need nobody, need nobody but you
I don't need nobody, need nobody but you

[Verse 2]
I'm just so used to emptiness
Can't feel your heartbeat when I'm lying on your chest
You're different from the ones before
I know you don't believe it's you I've waited for

[Pre-Chorus]
I was the one you took home
Never a flame to burn slow
But I was hoping you'd see me a different way
So many bodies I've touched
Crushing around me like dust
You are the realest thing I've never had to fake

[Chorus]
I don't need nobody, need nobody but
I don't need nobody, need nobody but you
I don't need nobody, need nobody but you
I don't need nobody, need nobody but you

[Bridge]
But I was hoping you'd see me a different way
You are the realest thing I've never had to fake

[Chorus]
I don't need nobody, need nobody but
I don't need nobody, need nobody but you
I don't need nobody, need nobody but you
I don't need nobody, need nobody but you

[Verse 1]
If I was not myself
And you were someone else
I'd say so much to you
And I would tell the truth
'Cause I can hardly breathe
When your hands let go of me
The ice is thinning out
And my feet brace themselves

[Chorus 1]
I'm there in the water
Still looking for you
I'm there in the water
Can't you see?
Can't you see?

[Verse 2]
You've seen this all before
A life left on the shore
We're smiling all the same
You sail away again

[Chorus 1]
I'm there in the water
Still looking for you
I'm there in the water
Can't you see?
Can't you see?

[Instrumental Bridge]

[Chorus 2]

Dead in the water

Still looking for you

I'm dead in the water
Can't you see?
Can't you see?
I'm dead in the water
Still looking for you
I'm dead in the water
Can't you see?

[Outro]
I'm dead in the water
Still looking for you
I'm dead in the water
Can't you see?
Can't you see?

[Verse 1]
Hold me like nobody else does
Do I get the best of your love?
Even when our bodies are drunk
Is it me you're stumbling from?
Forget the words that you said
With your fingers spell out my name
Take away the sky in our breath
Remember love is a game, love is a game

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't break, don't fade
While we're not real, we're never too late
Make time, it wont hurt
Said Ill go now, but you said it first

[Chorus]
I know there's nothing that I can do to make you stay
But one thing I know that will always remain
And that's the aftertaste
The aftertaste
The aftertaste
The aftertaste
The aftertaste

[Verse 2]
In the midst I'm seeing your face
And I can't believe this is fake
Blow the blossom into your room
As you throw me in disarray
There's a button that I need to press
There's a face that I need to kiss
Come on, give me your heart and your head
Make you conscious never resist, never resist

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't break, don't fade
While we're not real, we're never too late
Make time, it wont hurt
Said Ill go now, but you said it first

[Chorus]
I know there's nothing that I can do to make you stay
But one thing I know that will always remain
And that's the aftertaste
The aftertaste
The aftertaste
The aftertaste
The aftertaste
I know there's nothing that I can do to make you stay
But one thing I know that will always remain
And that's the aftertaste
The aftertaste
The aftertaste
The aftertaste
The aftertaste
The aftertaste
The aftertaste
The aftertaste
The aftertaste

[Verse 1]
Clinging to me
Like a last breath you would breathe
You were like home to me
I don't recognize the street

Please don't close your eyes
Don't know where to look without them
Outside the cars speed by
I'd never heard them until now

[Chorus]
I know you care
I know it is always been there
But there's trouble ahead, I can feel it
You are just saving yourself when you hide it
Yeah, I know you care
I see it in the way that you stare
As if there was trouble ahead and you knew it
I'll be saving myself from the ruin
And I know you care

[Verse 2]
I used to run down the stairs
To the door when I thought you were there
Do you shape through the comfort of us
Two lovers locked out of love

[Chorus]
Oh, but I know you care
I know it has always been there
But there's trouble ahead, I can feel it
You are just saving yourself when you hide it
Yeah, I know you care
I see it in the way that you stare
As if there was trouble ahead and you knew it
I'll be saving myself from the ruin

[Bridge]
I know it wasn't always wrong
But I've never known a winter so cold
Now I don't warm my hands in your coat
But I still hope
'cause this is how things ought to have been
And I know the worst of it wasn't all that it seemed
Why can't I dream?
And why can't I dream?

[Outro]
Because I know you care
And I know you care
I know you care
I know you care
I know it's always been there

[Intro]


[Verse 1: Ellie Goulding]
Bite chunks out of me
Youre a shark and Im swimming
My heart still thumps as I bleed
And all your friends come sniffing

[Pre-Hook]
Triangles are my favorite shape
Three points where two lines meet
Toe-to-toe, back-to-back, lets go, my love; its very late
Til morning comes, lets tessellate

[Hook]
Go alone my flower
And keep my whole lovely you
Wild green stones alone my lover
And keep us on my heart

[Verse 2]
Three guns and one goes off
Ones empty, ones not quick enough
One burn, one red, one grin
Search the graves while the camera spins
Chunks of you will sink down to seals
Blubber rich in mourning, theyll nosh you up
Yes, theyll nosh the love away but its fair to say
You will still haunt me

[Pre-Hook]

[Verse 1]

[Pre-Hook + Hook]

[Bridge]
Three guns and one goes off
Ones empty, ones not quick enough
One burn, one red, one grin
Search the graves while the camera spins

Chunks of you will sink down to seals
Blubber rich in mourning, theyll nosh you up
Yes, theyll nosh the love away but its fair to say
You will still haunt me

[Pre-Hook]
Triangles are my favorite shape
Three points where two lines meet
Toe to toe, back to back, lets go my love; its very late
Til morning comes, lets tessellate

[Outro]
Well I've been stoned to love my lover
Keep my soul, my heart

[Verse 1]
Gotta love this field and the cherry sky
Under blossom clouds though it's late July
You don't even try; still, you look so cool
Like a cover boy when you light the moon

[Verse 2]
Near the countryside but I just forgot
All the things that matter I forget a lot
I get so caught up in the city cloud
But this place is still my first love

[Chorus]
Is there anybody out there waiting for me on my way?
If that somebody is you, then baby, I just wanna say
Tonight, nothing will bring us down
Tonight, we're at the lost and found

[Verse 3]
Guess I need to run, take me to the bus
But don't let me go, no, don't let me on
Gotta hold me tight, won't put up a fight
Of course I'll stay, I'll stay the night

[Chorus]
Is there anybody out there waiting for me on my way?
If that somebody is you, then baby, I just wanna say
Tonight, nothing will bring us down
Tonight, we're at the lost and found

[Bridge]
We're at the lost and found
We're at the lost and found

[Chorus]
Is there anybody out there waiting for me on my way?
If that somebody is you, then baby, I just wanna say
Tonight, nothing will bring us down
Tonight, we're at the lost and found

[Outro]
We're at the lost and found
We're at the lost and found

[Verse 1]
When you appeared
I was just lonely
I was just in need of a friend
Spend your days
Thinking if only
Thinking if only you and me made sense
For any love
Quit the pain you feel
You won't let it go
You won't let it heal
Baby, it's clear
You don't know me
You don't know me

[Chorus]
And I don't have the heart that you think I do
And you give me so much, it's too much to lose
You know I'm not the one
Baby, I'm not the one
I can't show you my love that you showed to me
When it isn't enough, I won't make-believe
You know I'm not the one
Baby, leave love alone
Let it heal
Let it heal

[Verse 2]
It's in your eyes
I can see that you're broken
I know you're lost because I am too
It's in your voice
I hear you choking
When did the illusion take the truth
I think you're in love
With the pain you feel
You won't let it go
You won't let it heal
Baby it's clear
You don't even know me
You don't even know me

[Chorus]
And I don't have the heart that you think I do
And you give me so much, it's too much to lose
You know I'm not the one
Baby, I'm not the one
I can't show you my love that you showed to me
When it isn't enough, I won't make-believe
You know I'm not the one
Baby, leave love alone
Let it heal
Let it heal

[Bridge]
You lit the fire and you held it in your hands until it flickered out
It wasn't innocent, you've measured every inch of love you've given now
You lit the fire and you held it in your hands until it flickered out
It wasn't innocent, you've measured every inch of love you've given now

[Chorus]
And I don't have the heart that you think I do
And you give me so much, it's too much to lose
You know I'm not the one
Baby, I'm not the one
I can't show you my love that you showed to me
When it isn't enough, I won't make-believe
You know I'm not the one
Baby, leave love alone
Let it heal
Let it heal

[Verse 1]
Damn, boy you make it hard
Shouldn't need a riddle to unlock your heart
So, say what's on your mind
We got other things that we could do with our
Time, we could rule the world
Know you say you never need another girl
But, you're not making sense
Trying to keep it moving while you're on the fence

[Pre-Chorus]
Tell me black and white
Why I'm here tonight
I can't read the signs

[Chorus]
Stop talking in codes, stop talking in codes
Let me know what's up, can't do it no more
I need a love to celebrate
Stop talking in codes, stop talking in codes
Let me know what's up, cant do it no more
So baby, take it all the way
Stop talking in codes

[Verse 2]
It's a mystery
I know that something happened in your history
Oh, it's too much to risk
You give me some, but you've been holding most of it
Back, so it's no surprise
Everything you do, I over analyze
Breathe, in and out
Baby, give me something new to think about

[Pre-Chorus]
Tell me black and white
Why I'm here tonight
I can't read the signs

[Chorus]
Stop talking in codes, stop talking in codes
Let me know what's up, can't do it no more
I need a love to celebrate
Stop talking in codes, stop talking in codes
Let me know what's up, cant do it no more
So baby, take it all the way
Stop talking in codes

[Pre-Chorus]
Tell me black and white
Why I'm here tonight
I can't read the signs

[Chorus]
Stop talking in codes, stop talking in codes
Let me know what's up, can't do it no more
I need a love to celebrate
Stop talking in codes, stop talking in codes
Let me know what's up, cant do it no more
So baby, take it all the way
Stop talking in codes
Stop talking in codes, stop talking in codes
Let me know what's up, can't do it no more
I need a love to celebrate
Stop talking in codes, stop talking in codes
Let me know what's up, cant do it no more
So baby, take it all the way
Stop talking in codes

[Intro]
I do what I love
I do what I love and I love what I do

[Verse 1]
How many times do I need to
Need to fight you baby
Just to get that it's no good
And I know that I'm strong
But my mind's almost gone
And it's getting on my mood
And all this buzzing you been doing
See you got me hanging up
See you really got me worse

[Pre-Chorus]
But I got to move on, baby
Because bitches got to eat
Got to get back to work
I can't ask for your permission
I can't wait for it
Because I was born free
I ain't taking shit

[Chorus]
I do what I love and I love what I do
Stop me, stop me
I'm stopping you
Get the move right, baby, I'll show what I mean
Don't stop me, stop me, I like how it feels
I do what I love and I love what I do
Stop me, stop me
I'm stopping you
Get the move right, baby, I'll show what I mean
Don't stop me, stop me, I like how it feels

[Verse 2]
How many hits do you need for
Me to get it in you
Get it in you
And I'm strong and my heart
In my heart it won't change
For anyone or anything
And if you're crying about your lover
Because your lover is a dick
This will get you over it

[Pre-Chorus]
But you got to move on, baby
Because bitches got to eat
Got to get back to work
I can't ask for your permission
I can't wait for it
Because I was born free
I ain't taking this

[Chorus]
I do what I love and I love what I do
Stop me, stop me
I'm stopping you
Get the move right, baby, I'll show what I mean
Don't stop me, stop me, I like how it feels

[Bridge]
I do what I love and I love what I do
I do what I love and I love what I do
Get move right baby, I'll show what I mean
Get move right baby, I'll show what I mean

[Chorus]
I do what I love and I love what I do
Stop me, stop me
I'm stopping you
Get the move right, baby, I'll show what I mean
Don't stop me, stop me, I like how it feels
I do what I love and I love what I do
Stop me, stop me
I'm stopping you
Get the move right, baby, I'll show what I mean
Don't stop me, stop me, I like how it feels

[Outro]
I do what I love and I love what I do

[Chorus]
You know you're fighting in a losing battle
Making a noose out of your hollow crown
I hold a match up to your paper castle
And watch it all burn down, down, down
You know youre fighting in a losing battle
Making a noose out of your hollow crown
I hold a match up to your paper castle
And watch it all burn down, down, down
Down, down, down

[Verse 1]
T-tell me what you see, my dear, my dear
Is there anyone you trust 'round here, 'round here
Keep a knife under your pillow, the sharks and the minnows
Smell blood in the water round here, 'round here
And tell me who you're fighting right now, right now
You got everyone against you somehow, somehow
It's become an obsession, look at your reflection
And look who you're becoming right now, right now 

[Pre-Chorus]
I could've been who you trusted 
I could've been who you need right now 
But you pushed me away, yeah, you lost me 
And now you're lost

[Chorus]
You know youre fighting in a losing battle
Making a noose out of your hollow crown
I hold a match up to your paper castle
And watch it all burn down, down, down
You know youre fighting in a losing battle
Making a noose out of your hollow crown
I hold a match up to your paper castle
And watch it all burn down, down, down
Down, down, down

[Verse 2]
A funny kind of love, my dear, my dear
Got a kick out of the taste of my tears out here
Thought you had to play a villain, running from your feelings
But I'm walking on my own, no fear, no fear 

[Pre-Chorus]
I couldve been who you trusted 

I could've been who you need right now 
But you pushed me away, yeah, you lost me 
And now you're lost

[Chorus]
You know youre fighting in a losing battle
Making a noose out of your hollow crown
I hold a match up to your paper castle
And watch it all burn down, down, down
You know you're fighting in a losing battle
Making a noose out of your hollow crown
I hold a match up to your paper castle
And watch it all burn down, down, down
Down, down, down

[Intro]
Oh, oh, starry-eyed
Hip, oh, oh, sta-a-a-a
Oh, oh, ["starry-eyed" backwards]
["Everybody goes" backwards], s-starry-eyed
Hit, hit, hit, hit, hit me with lightning

[Verse 1]
Handlebars that I let go, let go for anyone
Take me in and I'll throw out my heart and get a new one

[Pre-Chorus]
Next thing, we're touching
You look at me, it's like you hit me with lightning, ah ah...

[Chorus]
Oh, everybody's starry-eyed
And everybody glows
Oh, everybody's starry-eyed
Oh, everybody's starry-eyed
And my body goes woah-oh-oh
Ah ah, whoa-oh-oh
Ah ah, whoa-oh-oh

[Verse 2]
So we burst into colours, colours and carousels
Fall head first like paper planes and playground games

[Pre-Chorus]
Next thing, we're touching
You look at me, it's like you hit me with lightning

[Chorus]
Oh, everybody's starry-eyed 
And everybody glows
Oh, everybody's starry-eyed
And my body goes woah-oh-oh 
Ah ah, whoa-oh-oh
Ah ah, whoa-oh-oh 
Sta-a-a-a

[Hook]
Next thing we're touching 
Next thing we're touching 
Next thing we're touching 
Next thing we're touching 
Next thing we're touching 
Next thing we're touching 
Next thing we're touching
Next thing we're touchi-i-ing
Hit me with lightning

[Chorus]
Oh, everybody's starry-eyed
And everybody glows
Oh, everybody's starry-eyed
And my body goes
Oh, everybody's starry-eyed 
And everybody glows
Oh, everybody's starry-eyed 
And my body goes whoa-oh-oh 
Ah ah, whoa-oh-oh 
Ah ah, whoa-oh-oh
Ah ooh ooh ooh...[Produced by Greg Kurstin]

[Verse 1]
Bite down on your lip
Take another sip
Stop checking your phone
Looking for the answers
Mind running obsessed
Feeling paralyzed
Let me watch you undress
Fall into the night

[Pre-Chorus]
Yeah, we change and we change and we feel so lost
And we don't know who we are
Yeah, we break and we break and we just can't stop
So we just keep breaking hearts

[Chorus]
Why you wanna ruin a good thing?
Can we take it back to the start?
When love's not playing out like the movies
It doesn't mean it's falling apart
Don't panic
Don't panic

[Verse 2]
Been shattered before
Everything breaks
I can't really be sure
Of our mistakes
Come under my love
Like an umbrella
Going to make you feel good
Yeah, better than ever

[Pre-Chorus]
Yeah, we change and we change and we feel so lost
And we don't know who we are
Yeah, we break and we break and we just can't stop
So we just keep breaking hearts

[Chorus]
Why you wanna ruin a good thing?
Can we take it back to the start?
When love's not playing out like the movies
It doesn't mean it's falling apart
Don't panic
Don't panic

[Bridge]
I got big dreams baby
I got big dreams baby
So don't you over complicate it
I got big dreams baby
I got big dreams baby
So don't you, don't you over complicate it

[Chorus]
Why you wanna ruin a good thing?
Can we take it back to the start?
When love's not playing out like the movies
It doesn't mean it's falling apart
Don't panic
Don't panic
Don't panic
Don't panic

[Verse 1]
Open up and let me in
Show the bruises on your skin
Let the fires all burn out
I can hear the silent shout in you
Let it go don't be so scared
Find the love you lost again
Let the chaos disappear
Don't you know I'm always here for you?

[Chorus]
Cause this is devotion, I am lost
You're the only one I see
Our bodies in motion, I am caught
Floating in your gravity
Whenever you break, I'll fix it for you
I'm the one who drives to you at night
And maybe we'll fall a little deeper
I think our little hearts will be alright
Cause this is devotion

[Verse 2]
Tell me what you dream about
I lose you in my sleep, somehow
Let the chaos disappear
Don't you know I'm always there for you?

[Chorus]
Cause this is devotion, I am lost
You're the only one I see
Our bodies in motion, I am caught
Floating in your gravity
Whenever you break, I'll fix it for you
I'm the one who drives to you at night
And maybe we'll fall a little deeper
I think our little hearts will be alright
Cause this is devotion

[Bridge]
Cause this is devotion, I am lost
You're the only one I see
Our bodies in motion, I am caught
Floating in your gravity

[Chorus]
Cause this is devotion, I am lost
You're the only one I see
Our bodies in motion, I am caught
Floating in your gravity
Whenever you break, I'll fix it for you
I'm the one who drives to you at night
And maybe we'll fall a little deeper
I think our little hearts will be alright
Cause this is devotion

[Verse 1]
It's coming on Christmas
Theyre cutting down trees
They're putting up reindeer
And singing songs of joy andpeace
Oh,I wish Ihad a river I could skateaway on
But it don't snow here
It stays pretty green
Im gonna make a lot of money
Then I'm going to quit this crazy scene
Oh, I wish I had a river I could skate away on

[Chorus]
I wish I had a river so long
I would teach my feet to fly
Oh, I wish I had a river I could skate away on
I made my baby cry

[Verse 2]
He tried hard to help me
You know, he put me at ease
And he loved me so naughty
Made me so weak in the knees
Oh, I wish I had a river I could skate away on
I'm so hard to handle
I'm selfish and I'm sad
Now I've gone and lost the best baby
That I ever had
I wish I had a river I could skate away on

[Chorus]
Oh, I wish I had a river so long
I would teach my feet to fly
I wish I had a river I could skate away on
I made my baby say goodbye

[Outro]
It's coming on Christmas
They're cutting down trees
Theyre putting up reindeer
And singing songs of joy and peace
Oh, I wish I had a river I could skate away on

[Verse 1]
You're falling at your feet, giving everything up
There's something in the way, love is never enough
I see your sorry hand putting down the gun
With a war in your mind that never wants to be won
I catch you in a light no one else can see
I know you see her, and you'll never see me
She makes you feel the most, keep your souls alive
But what we had, it never really died

[Chorus]
And this is what I'll say if I had any words
Wish we hadn't messed up, now your heart is with hers
And I know that your love wasn't here to stay
I gave you all of mine but you gave it away
And now you're the one who hurts
You had to love someone else just to know your worth
But here's to us
Here's to us
Here's to us

[Verse 2]
Yeah, this is just a phase, pretty sure of that
And one day, you and I, we will never look back
You kept me in the flames but the fire was out, the fire was out, the fire was out

[Chorus]
And this is what I'll say if I had any words
Wish we hadn't messed up, now your heart is with hers
And I know that your love wasn't here to stay
I gave you all of mine but you gave it away
And now you're the one who hurts
You had to love someone else just to know your worth

[Bridge:]
Ooh ooh
Ah ah
Ooh ooh
Ah ah
Ooh ooh
Ah ah
Ooh ooh
Ah ah
Ooh ooh

[Chorus]
And this is what I'll say if I had any words
Wish we hadn't messed up, now your heart is with hers
And I know that your love wasn't here to stay
I gave you all of mine but you gave it away
And now you're the one who hurts
You had to love someone else just to know your worth
But here's to us
Here's to us
Here's to us

[Chorus 1]
Only you can be the aching in my heart
My enemy, the only animal I couldn't fight
You hold me in the dark when storms arrive
Only you

[Chorus 2]
Only you can see the emptiness I feel
When you're with me
When everything you say I'm on my knees
Baby I'm on my knees
Baby I'm on my knees
Baby I'm on my knees
When everything you say I'm on my knees
Baby I'm on my knees
Baby I'm on my knees
Baby I'm on my knees

[Chorus 1]
Only you can be the aching in my heart
My enemy, the only animal I couldn't fight
You hold me in the dark when storms arrive
Only you

[Chorus 2]
Only you can see the emptiness I feel
When you're with me
When everything you say I'm on my knees
Baby I'm on my knees
Baby I'm on my knees
Baby I'm on my knees
When everything you say I'm on my knees
Baby I'm on my knees
Baby I'm on my knees
Baby I'm on my knees

Only you
Only you
Only you

[Chorus 1]
Only you can be the aching in my heart
My enemy, the only animal I couldn't fight
You hold me in the dark when storms arrive
Only you
Only you can be the aching in my heart
My enemy, the only animal I couldn't fight
You hold me in the dark when storms arrive
Only you

[Verse 1]
Let's call it a day, babe
I think I know what you're trying to say
Honey, it's fair play
Why try to win when I know I've lost?
We don't have to spell it
I think I know what you're trying to say
Just because I think this could break me
It doesn't mean that it will at all

[Pre-Chorus]
Love to the lovers
Hate to the haters
Love to you, babe
Do what you have to

[Chorus]
What a shame
What a loss
The winner takes
She takes it all
What a shame
What a loss
But I can see why
Because she's beautiful
What a defeat
To say the least
But thank God
The love is free
And maybe it's good for you
It's good for me

[Verse 2]
Let's call it a day, babe
I think I know what you're trying to say
And honey you're so right
There's so much to lose, but so much to learn
Let's call it a maybe
But we both know you're already gone
And just because it feels like I'm breaking
It doesn't mean I will fall apart

[Pre-Chorus]
Love to the lovers
Hate to the haters
Love to you, babe
Do what you have to

[Chorus]
What a shame
What a loss
The winner takes
She takes it all
What a shame
What a loss
But I can see why
Because she's beautiful
What a defeat
To say the least
But thank God
The love is free
And maybe it's good for you
It's good for me

[Pre-Chorus]
Love to you, babe
Love to the lovers
Hate to the haters
Love to you, babe
Do what you have to

[Chorus]
What a shame
What a loss
The winner takes
She takes it all
What a shame
What a loss
But I can see why
Because she's beautiful
What a defeat
To say the least
But thank God
The love is free
And maybe it's good for you
It's good for me

[Verse 1]
People like to talk because they don't know what to say
Running from the truth because the truth's too much to take
I keep raising glasses cause I only got today
I just keep moving, I just keep moving

[Chorus]
You can hurt me, I'll find another
You can love me, you'll be my lover
Happy, in rain or thunder
Baby I keep
I keep on, I keep on, I just keep on dancing
I just keep on dancing
I just keep on dancing

[Verse 2]
Can you see my, see my headlights
You can come ride shotgun with me
Whatever you like, ever you like
Every time I look at those stars
Know they ain't got the answers for me
But I'll be alright, I'll be alright

[Chorus]
You can hurt me, I'll find another
You can love me, you'll be my lover
Happy, in rain or thunder
Baby I keep
I keep on, I keep on, I just keep on dancing
I just keep on dancing
I just keep on dancing
You can hurt me, I'll find another
You can love me, you'll be my lover
I just keep on dancing

[Verse 1]
If you'd never said anything
If you'd never said anything
If you never, If you never
If you never, If you'd never said anything

[Chorus]
If you never, if you never
Ohhhh
If you never, if you never
Ohhhh
If you never, if you never
Ohhhh
If you never, if you never

[Verse 2]
Here it is in my hands
In my veins, and overland
It spreads like fire, seeking air
To pull me in, my own funfair

Won't you come, won't you come
Won't you come, just don't say a word
Won't you come, won't you come
Won't you come, just don't say a word

[Chorus]
If you never, if you never
Ohhhh
If you never, if you never
Ohhhh
If you never, if you never
Ohhhh
If you never, if you never

[Bridge]
I'm more alive I've ever been
So now I give you all my sins
I've chosen you, I've chosen you
But don't say a word

And if I save us, and I fall down
I will leave your words behind now
If you never, held me under, if you never hear my thunder

[Chorus]
If you never, if you never
Ohhhh
If you never, if you never
Ohhhh
If you never, if you never
Ohhhh
If you never, if you never

[Verse 1]
I know it's not over, baby I worked this out for sure
It's going to be colder, now you've forced open the door
I know you better than I ever have before
I know you

I know you're a fighter
But you never fought for me when I was a shelter
So you're not heading home to me

We could be closer, we could be closer
We could be

[Pre-Chorus]
When it's just us
You show me what it feels like to be lonely
You show me what it feels like to be lost
I take your hand for you to let it go
Let it go, let it go, let it go

[Pre-Chorus]
When it's just us
You show me what it feels like to be lonely
You show me what it feels like to be lost
I take your hand for you to let it go
Let it go, let it go, let it go

[Chorus]
It's going to be, it's gonna be better
It's going to be better, it's gonna be better
It's going to be better
It's going to be better
It's going to be better
It's going to be
It's going to be better
It's going to be better

[Verse 2]
We'll take a long walk, down the alleys of these houses
And we'll talk, see what conversation rouses when we're alone
When we're alone, it could be home

[Pre-Chorus]
When it's just us
You show me what it feels like to be lonely
You show me what it feels like to be lost
I take your hand for you to let it go
Let it go, let it go, let it go

[Chorus]
It's going to be, it's gonna be better
It's going to be better, it's gonna be better
It's going to be better
It's going to be better
It's going to be better
It's going to be
It's going to be better
It's going to be better

[Verse 1]
Aren't you somethin' to admire?
'Cause your shine is somethin' like a mirror
And I can't help but notice
You reflect in this heart of mine
If you ever feel alone and
The glare makes me hard to find
Just know that I'm always
Parallel on the other side

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause with your hand in my hand and a pocket full of soul
I can tell you there's no place we couldn't go
Just put your hand on the past
I'm here tryna pull you through
You just gotta be strong

[Chorus]
I don't wanna lose you now
I'm lookin' right at the other half of me
The vacancy that sat in my heart
Is a space that now you hold
Show me how to fight for now
And I'll tell you, baby, it was easy
Comin' back here to you once I figured it out
You were right here all along
It's like you're my mirror 
My mirror staring back at me  
I couldn't get any bigger 
With anyone else beside me 
And now it's clear as this promise
That we're making
Two reflections into one
'Cause it's like you're my mirror 
My mirror staring back at me, staring back at me

[Verse 2]
Aren't you somethin', an original?
'Cause it doesn't seem merely assembled
And I can't help but stare, 'cause
I see truth somewhere in your eyes
I can't ever change without you
You reflect me, I love that about you
And if I could, I
Would look at us all the time

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause with your hand in my hand and a pocket full of soul
I can tell you there's no place we couldn't go
Just put your hand on the past
I'm here tryna pull you through
You just gotta be strong

[Chorus]
I don't wanna lose you now
I'm lookin' right at the other half of me
The vacancy that sat in my heart
Is a space that now you hold
Show me how to fight for now
And I'll tell you, baby, it was easy
Comin' back here to you once I figured it out
You were right here all along
It's like you're my mirror 
My mirror staring back at me 
I couldn't get any bigger 
With anyone else beside me 
And now it's clear as this promise
That we're making
Two reflections into one
'Cause it's like you're my mirror 
My mirror staring back at me, staring back at me

[Bridge]
Yesterday is history, oh
Tomorrow's a mystery, oh
I can see you lookin' back at me
Keep your eyes on me
Baby, keep your eyes on me

[Chorus]
'Cause I don't wanna lose you now
I'm lookin' right at the other half of me
The vacancy that sat in my heart
Is a space that now you hold
Show me how to fight for now 
And I'll tell you, baby, it was easy
Comin' back here to you once I figured it out
You were right here all along
It's like you're my mirror 
My mirror staring back at me 
I couldn't get any bigger 
With anyone else beside me 
And now it's clear as this promise
That we're making
Two reflections into one
'Cause it's like you're my mirror 
My mirror staring back at me, staring back at me

[Post-Chorus]
Ohh 
Ohh 
Ohh ohh 
Uhh 
Ohh

Now, you're the inspiration of this precious song
And I just wanna see your face light up since you put me on
So now I say goodbye to the old me, it's already gone
And I can't wait, wait, wait, wait, wait to get you home
Just to let you know, you are

[Intro: Justin Timberlake & Timbaland]
Ooh-oh

Wait a minute
You ready, JT?

[Verse 1: Justin Timberlake]
I can't wait 'til I get you on the floor, good-lookin'
Going hot, so hot, just like an oven
And ow! Burned myself, but just had to touch it
And it's so so fine, and it's all mine
Hey, baby, we don't mind all the watching 
Cause if they study close, real close
They might learn something
She ain't nothing but a little doozy when she does it
She's so fire tonight

[Chorus: Justin Timberlake]
And as long as I've got my suit and tie
I'ma leave it all on the floor tonight
And you got fixed up to the nines
Let me show you a few things 
All pressed up in black and white
And you're dressed in that dress I like
Love is swinging in the air tonight
Let me show you a few things 
Let me show you a few things
Show you a few things about love
Now were in the swing of love
Let me show you a few things
Show you a few things
Show you a few things about love, hey

[Verse 2: Justin Timberlake]
Stop, let me get a good look at it
So thick, now I know why they call it a fatty
And ow!
Shit so sick got a hit and picked up a habit
That's alright, cause you're all mine 
Go on and show 'em who you call daddy
I guess they're just mad
Cause, girl, they wish they had it
My killer, my Thriller, yeah, you're a classic
And you're all mine, tonight

[Chorus: Justin Timberlake]
And as long as I've got my suit and tie
I'ma leave it all on the floor tonight
And you got fixed up to the nines
Let me show you a few things
All pressed up in black and white
And you're dressed in that dress I like
Love is swinging in the air tonight
Let me show you a few things
Let me show you a few things
Show you a few things about love
Now were in the swing of love
Let me show you a few things
Show you a few things about love, hey

[Interlude: Justin Timberlake]
Get out your seat, Hov!

[Verse 3: JAY-Z]
Uh!
All black at the white shows
White shoes at the black shows
Green card for the Cuban linx
Y'all sit back and enjoy the light show
Nothing exceeds like excess
Stoute got gout from having the best of the best
Is this what it's all about? I'm at the rest-
aurant with my rant disturbing the guests
Years of distress, tears on the dress
Try to hide her face with some makeup sex
Uh!
This is truffle season
Tom Ford tuxedos for no reason
All Saints for my angel, Alexander Wang too
Ass-tight denim and some Dunks
I'll show you how to do this young, uh!
No papers, catch vapors
Get high, out Vegas
D'USS's on doubles, ain't looking for trouble
You just got good genes so a nigga tryna cuff you
Tell your mother that I love her cause I love you
Tell your father we go farther as a couple
They ain't lose a daughter, got a son
I show you how to do this, huh! Uh

[Chorus: Justin Timberlake]
And as long as I've got my suit and tie
I'ma leave it all on the floor tonight
And you got fixed up to the nines
Let me show you a few things 
All pressed up in black and white
And you're dressed in that dress I like
Love is swinging in the air tonight
Let me show you a few things 
Let me show you a few things 
Show you a few things about love, love, love
Let me show you a few things 
Show you a few things about love, hey
Ow!

[Outro: Justin Timberlake]

[Intro: Justin Timberlake]
Mhmm, yeah, alright
Ooh

[Verse 1: Justin Timberlake]
Everyone knows all about my direction
And in my heart somewhere I wanna go there
Still, I don't go there

[Chorus: Justin Timberlake & Chris Stapleton]
Everybody says, "say something that says something
Say something that says something
Say something that says something
I don't wanna get caught, up in the rhythm of it
But I can't help myself, no, I can't help myself, no, no
Caught up in the middle of it
No, I can't help myself, no I can't help myself, no, no, no
Caught up in the rhythm of it

[Post-Chorus: Justin Timberlake & Chris Stapleton]
Maybe I'm looking for something I can't have 
Maybe I'm looking for something I can't have

[Verse 2: Chris Stapleton & Justin Timberlake]
Everyone knows all about my transgressions
Still in my heart somewhere, there's melody and harmony
For you and me, tonight 
I hear them call my name

[Chorus: Chris Stapleton & Justin Timberlake]
Everybody says, "Say something"
Then, "Say something, say something"
Then, "Say something, say something"
Then, "Say something"
I don't want to get caught up in the rhythm of it
But I can't get help myself, no I can't help myself, no, no
Caught up in the middle of it
No, I can't help myself, no I can't help myself, no, no, no
Caught up in the rhythm of it

[Post-Chorus: Justin Timberlake & Chris Stapleton]
Maybe I'm looking for something I can't have 
Maybe I'm looking for something I can't have 
Maybe I'm looking for something I can't have 
Maybe I'm looking for something I can't have 

[Bridge: Justin Timberlake & Chris Stapleton]
Sometimes, the greatest way to say something is to say nothing at all
Sometimes, the greatest way to say something is to say nothing at all
Sometimes, the greatest way to say something is to say nothing

[Part-Chorus: Justin Timberlake & Chris Stapleton]
But I can't help myself, no I can't help myself, no, no
Caught up in the middle of it
No, I can't help myself, no I can't help myself, no, no, no
Caught up in the rhythm of it

[Post-Chorus: Justin Timberlake & Chris Stapleton]
Maybe I'm looking for something I can't have 
Maybe I'm looking for something I can't have 
Maybe I'm looking for something I can't have 
Maybe I'm looking for something I can't have 

[Outro: Justin Timberlake & Chris Stapleton]
Sometimes the greatest way to say something is to say nothing at all
Sometimes the greatest way to say something is to say nothing at all
Sometimes the greatest way to say something is to say nothing

[Verse 1]

But I want you to go on and use me too
Nothing else will do

I'm just a, junkie for your love
I'm just a, junkie for your love 
Now I'm just a, junkie for your love 
And now I'm just a junkie for your love 
My heroine, my cocaine, my plum wine, my MDMA

Now I can't wait 'til I get home and get you in my veins 
I'm just a, junkie for your love 
And now I'm just a, junkie for your love 
I'm just a, junkie for your love 
And now I'm just a, junkie for your love
Uh, my nicotine, my blue dream, my hydroponic candy jelly bean
Did you fix me up, I'm your number one fiend
Be my little pill and just creep into my bloodstream
Bloodshot eyes, I'm hopped up on it
You ain't gotta think twice, just hop up on it
There's a million names for your kind of chronic
Uh, that pusher love, that's what I call it 
I'm just a, junkie for your love 
Now I'm just a, junkie for your love
Let me hear you say 
Now I'm just a, junkie for your love 
And now I'm just a, junkie for your love


[Verse 1: Justin Timberlake]
You with the sad eyes
Don't be discouraged, oh I realize
It's hard to take courage
In a world full of people
You can lose sight of it all
The darkness inside you
Can make you feel so small

[Pre-Chorus: Justin Timberlake & Anna Kendrick]
Show me a smile then
Don't be unhappy
Can't remember when
I last saw you laughing
This world makes you crazy
And you've taken all you
Can bear
Just, call me up
'Cause I will always be there

[Chorus: Justin Timberlake]
And I see your true colors
Shining through
I see your true colors
And that's why I love you

[Chorus: Justin Timberlake, Anna Kendrick, together]
So don't be afraid to let them show
Your true colors
True colors are beautiful

I see your true colors

And that's why I love you
So don't be afraid to let them show
Your true colors
True colors are beautiful
Like a rainbow
Oooooh oooooh oooh like a rainbow

Look closer, through the trees
Do you see it?

[Intro: Justin Timberlake & ]
I don't understand it
Tell me, how could you be so low?

Dammit babe


[Verse 1: J. Cole]
Blood thicker than water, right
Fuck bitches, they all alike
Stand up nigga, not the fallin' type
Heart blacker than a Harlem night
Til I met you, they say the devil wear Prada
But I doubt it cause the Lord did bless you
Damn look at that body
Short bus shorty, cause it sure is special
Cole to the rescue, never save a ho
Hoes like to hide their behavior though
Thought you was a down ass bitch
'til I found that shit a couple days ago
I was home alone, next thing I know
That long ass verse from a song called "Control" was on
The room got nearer, the tune got clearer
That's when I seen the shit playing on your phone
Girl, what is that, a ringtone?
Shit, not you too
Man that hype done got you too
Everybody and their momma gassed
Even my momma asked what I'mma do
Decisions, decisions
In case this is war, then I load up on all ammunition
If a nigga want problems, my trigger's on auto
I'll make sure that nobody miss him
Now pack up your shit, you don't believe in me?
I don't need you, I got me, bitch
Same nigga moved to NYC, bitch
Got a record deal and a college degree, bitch
Two gold plaques, I produced all the tracks
And I never ever ever lean on Jay-Z, bitch
And after all that achievement
Real nigga never even went and got his teeth fixed
Now you try to play me, bitch?
You try to fuckin' play me? I ought to knock your ass out

[Chorus: Justin Timberlake & ]
TKO, I don't understand it, tell me how could you be so low damn
You've been swingin' after the bell and after all of the whistle blows
Tried to go below the belt, through my chest, perfect hit to the dome
Dammit babe


[Verse 2: A$AP Rocky]
All hail Pretty Flacko, bitch, celebrate it
Had the game on lock, streets serenaded
Now you lame mothafuckas lookin' devastated
Bet you niggas wish you never hated, that's the devil ain't it
Fuck that shit, he rich, fuck that shit, he this, fuck that shit, he that
He black, he don't like blacks, fuck that shit, he wack
Fuck that shit he raps, fuck that shit he spits, fuck that bitch
Fuck that bitch he with, finished talking shit? Get up off my dick
The nonsense is synonymous with comments from the blogs about
Menages with the gossips and the bosses, fuck surprises
I'm monogamous and not to mention, in my closet
Is a model chick, grimey gothic fits, trapped inside of it
Besides it I'd deny the shit shit, y'all should stop the shit
I'm the shit, not just kinda sick, the doc prescribed my shit
Cock it, click-click, opposite, stop and droppin' shit
'fore poppin' shit, from popular to poppin' picks to poppin' tits
She pop her pussy, pop a Xanny, popular for compliments
Make it rain, she pop that shit, it boosts her confidence
Was supposed to stop this shit but spit like I forgot some shit
Forgot the topic, I hope God forgive you, peep my common sense

[Chorus: Justin Timberlake & ]
TKO, I don't understand it, tell me how could you be so low
You've been swingin' after the bell and after all of the whistle blows
Tried to go below the belt, through my chest, perfect hit to the dome
Dammit babe


[Verse 3: Pusha T]
JT this like deja vu right?
All this album of the year talk, niggas claimin' they're the best out
I been hot since the Purple Tape and this cuban's poking my chest out
They keep callin' on King Push, this beach chair, I'm stretched out
My name is my name, bitch, until I'm gone and it's etched out
I been known to blow a quarter brick on baby hairs and a messy bun
If I make her mine, I made her mind, she fall in line and we got some
Memoirs of a millionaire, even better I'm a reallionaire
Alaa skirt, Fendi work, dress my baby like build-a-bear
Fuck you know about the type of rollie? Fuck you know about blowin' bands?
Bezel on it like a grand circle, diamonds in it, holdin' hands
A1 since day one, I sold dope and my name rung
I sold dope where I came from and it's so dope what I made from it
No lie, know why? Guy Fish in my bowtie
JT up in the three piece and we magic baby like showtime

[Verse 1: Justin Timberlake]
Baby, every day in training to get the gold
Thats why your body's crazy
But you cant run from yourself, thats where its difficult
Girl, I can see in your eyes that theres something inside that made you evil
Where did you go? 'Cause it just ain't fair
Over here thinking 'bout the shit you say
Don't know why it gets to me

[Pre-Chorus: Justin Timberlake]
It cuts right on my eye, yeah, it hurt, won't lie
Still can't see, think I saw you with another guy
Fair fight, knocked down, then I got over you
Can't fight no more, you knock me out
What am I supposed to do?

[Chorus: Justin Timberlake]
I don't understand it
Tell me how could you be so low?
Been swinging after the bell and after all of the whistle blows
Tried to go below the belt, through my chest, perfect hit to the dome
Dammit, babe
This ain't the girl I used to know
No, not anymore, TKO

[Verse 2: Justin Timberlake]
Baby, now I really know what we're fighting for
This rematch sex is amazing
But nobody wins when if somebodys heart is swole
'Cause when I see you move like you got something inside that made you lethal
Where did you go? It just ain't fair
Over here thinking 'bout the shit you do
Don't know what I got to lose

[Pre-Chorus: Justin Timberlake]
It cuts right on my eye, yeah, it hurt, won't lie
Still can't see, think I saw you with another guy
Fair fight, knocked down, then I got over you
Can't fight no more, you knock me out
What am I supposed to do?

[Chorus: Justin Timberlake]
I don't understand it
Tell me how could you be so low?
Been swinging after the bell and after all of the whistle blows
Tried to go below the belt, through my chest, perfect hit to the dome

[Verse 1]
Don't know why, but girl, I'm feeling close to you
Maybe it's this ocean view, I'm so emotional
And all these thoughts been dancing on my head
For too long, too long, too long!
I wrote a song for you, I wanna sing to you
But every time I'm close to you
The words wanna come out, but I forget
It's so strong, it's so strong, it's so strong!

[Bridge]
It might seem like Im catching something
Thats because its true
I can't deny it, and I won't try it
But I think that you know
I look around and everything I see is beautiful
Cause all I see is you
And I can't deny it, and I stand by it
And I won't hide it anymore

[Chorus]
A crowded room anywhere
A million people around all I see is you there
And everything just disappears, disappears, disappears, disappears
Yeah, a million people in a crowded room
But my camera lens's only been set to zoom
And it all becomes so clear, comes so clear, becomes so clear
I got that tunnel vision for you
I got that tunnel vision for you
I got that tunnel vision for you
I got that tunnel vision
I only see you
I got that tunnel vision for you
I got that tunnel vision for you
I got that tunnel vision for you
I got that tunnel vision
I only see you, yeah

[Verse 2]
Now that I know the truth, what am I suppose to do?
Changing up and breaking all my rules ever since we met
I'm so gone, I'm so gone, I'm so gone
Just like the movie shoot, I'm zooming in on you
Everything is extra in the background, just fades into the set
As we ride off into the sun

[Bridge]
It might seem like Im catching something
Thats because its true
I can't deny it, and I won't try it
But I think that you know
I look around and everything I see is beautiful
Cause all I see is you
And I can't deny it, and I stand by it
And I won't hide it anymore!

[Chorus]
A crowded room anywhere
A million people around all I see is you there

[Verse 1]
I got this feeling inside my bones
It goes electric, wavey when I turn it on
All through my city, all through my home
We're flying up, no ceiling, when we in our zone

[Refrain]
I got that sunshine in my pocket
Got that good soul in my feet
I feel that hot blood in my body when it drops 
I can't take my eyes up off it, moving so phenomenally
Room on lock, the way we rock it, so don't stop

[Pre-Chorus]
And under the lights when everything goes
Nowhere to hide when I'm getting you close
When we move, well, you already know
So just imagine, just imagine, just imagine

[Chorus]
Nothing I can see but you when you dance, dance, dance
A feeling good, good, creeping up on you
So just dance, dance, dance, come on
All those things I shouldn't do
But you dance, dance, dance
And ain't nobody leaving soon, so keep dancing
I can't stop the feeling
So just dance, dance, dance
I can't stop the feeling
So just dance, dance, dance 

[Verse 2]
Ooh, it's something magical
It's in the air, it's in my blood, it's rushing on
I don't need no reason, don't need control
I fly so high, no ceiling, when I'm in my zone

[Refrain]
'Cause I got that sunshine in my pocket
Got that good soul in my feet
I feel that hot blood in my body when it drops
I can't take my eyes up off it, moving so phenomenally
Room on lock, the way we rock it, so don't stop

[Pre-Chorus]
And under the lights when everything goes
Nowhere to hide when I'm getting you close
When we move, well, you already know
So just imagine, just imagine, just imagine

Nothing I can see but you when you dance, dance, dance
A feeling good, good, creeping up on you
So just dance, dance, dance, come on
All those things I shouldn't do

And ain't nobody leaving soon, so keep dancing
I can't stop the feeling
So just dance, dance, dance
I can't stop the feeling
So just dance, dance, dance 
I can't stop the feeling
So just dance, dance, dance
I can't stop the feeling
So keep dancing 

[Bridge]
I can't stop the, I can't stop the
I can't stop the, I can't stop the

Nothing I can see but you when you dance, dance, dance

Feeling good, good, creeping up on you
So just dance, dance, dance, come on

All those things I shouldn't do
But you dance, dance, dance

And ain't nobody leaving soon, so keep dancing

Everybody sing

Got this feeling in my body

Got this feeling in my body
Can't stop the feeling
Got this feeling in my body, come on

[Intro: Timbaland]
Hi, how ya'll feeling tonight?
Thank ya'll for coming out to the the Y's Underground Club
Our first act up
All the way from Memphis, Tennessee
Show him some Southern love, JT and the Tennessee kids
Come on! Give it up

[Interlude: Justin Timberlake]
Thank you for having us out tonight
We're JT and the Tennessee Kids
One, two, three!
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse 1: Justin Timberlake]
Didn't have to run, I knew it was love from a mile away
But I had to catch you, running through my mind all day baby
They all say I'm crazy, 'cause anybody even when your father say
That I can't be with you, I don't hear a word they say

[Chorus: Justin Timberlake]
'Cause I'm in love with that girl, so don't be mad at me
'Cause I'm in love with that girl, so don't be mad at me
So what? You're from the other side of the tracks
So what? The world don't think we match
I'll put it down like my love's on wax
Guess what? I'm in love with that girl
And she told me, that she's in love with me

[Verse 2: Justin Timberlake]
Now we didn't have to fall, but we fell in love to the bottom, babe
No one's there to catch us, like when you fell from Heaven that day, baby
People always staring, but I don't care nothing about it, babe
Since I saw your face, I've been staring just the same

[Chorus: Justin Timberlake]
I'm in love with that girl, so don't be mad at me
I'm in love with that girl, so don't be mad at me
So what? You're from the other side of the tracks
So what? The world don't think we match
I'll put it down like my love's on wax, guess what
I'm in love with that girl
And she told me, that she's in love with me

[Verse 3: Justin Timberlake]
My pretty lady
You'll always be my baby, baby, baby
It's so amazing
How you became my baby, baby, baby
My little daisy
Come here, let me rock you like a baby, baby, baby
Pretty lady
Don't you know, you'll always be my baby, baby, baby
Now don't it seem like these days
That everybody's got something to say
But I don't pay attention to the talk, baby
And I don't really care if they stop and stare
'Cause they see my number one
My number one girl

[Chorus: Justin Timberlake]
I told you I'm in love with that girl, so don't be mad at me
I'm in love with that girl, so don't be mad at me
I don't care
So what? You're from the other side of the tracks
So what? The world don't think we match
I'll put it down like my love's on wax, guess what
I'm in love with that girl
And she already told me that she's in love with me

[Outro: Justin Timberlake]
I'm in love, yes, I'm in love with that girl
I don't care what people say, people say
Cause I'm in love with that girl

[Verse 1: Justin Timberlake]
You were my sun
You were my earth
But you didn't know all the ways I loved you, no
So you took a chance
And made other plans
But I bet you didn't think that they would come crashing down, no

[Pre-Chorus: Justin Timberlake]
You don't have to say what you did
I already know, I found out from him
Now there's just no chance
With you and me
There'll never be
And don't it make you sad about it?

[Chorus: Justin Timberlake]
You told me you loved me
Why did you leave me all alone?
Now you tell me you need me
When you call me on the phone
Girl, I refuse
You must have me confused
With some other guy
The bridges were burned
Now it's your turn, to cry
Cry me a river
Cry me a river
Cry me a river
Cry me a river 

[Verse 2: Justin Timberlake]
You know that they say some things are better left unsaid
It wasn't like you only talked to him and you know it
Don't act like you don't know it
And all of these things people told me
Keep messin' with my head 
Should've picked honesty
Then you may not have blown it

[Pre-Chorus: Justin Timberlake]
You don't have to say what you did
I already know, I found out from him
Now there's just no chance
With you and me
There'll never be
And don't it make you sad about it?

[Chorus: Justin Timberlake]
You told me you loved me
Why did you leave me all alone?
Now you tell me you need me
When you call me on the phone
Girl, I refuse
You must have me confused
With some other guy
The bridges were burned
Now it's your turn, to cry
So cry me a river
 Cry me a river
 Cry me a river
 Cry me a river

[Post-Chorus: Timbaland]
Oh!  oh, the damage is done
So I guess I'll be leaving
Oh!  oh, the damage is done
So I guess I'll be leaving
Oh!  oh, the damage is done
So I guess I'll be leaving
Oh!  oh, the damage is done
So I guess I'll be leaving

[Bridge: Justin Timberlake]
You don't have to say what you did
I already know, I found out from him
Now there's just no chance
With you and me
There'll never be
Don't it make you sad about it?

[Outro: Justin Timberlake]
Cry me a river

Cry me a river

Cry me a river

Cry me a river
Cry me a river

Cry me a river

Cry me a river

Cry me a river 
Cry me a river
Cry me a river
Oh, cry me a river
Oh, cry me a river
Oh, cry me a river

Oh, cry me a river

Oh, cry me a river

Oh, cry me a river

Oh, cry me a river

Oh, cry me a river

Oh, cry me a river
[Verse 1: Justin Timberlake & Timbaland]

I think it's special, what's behind your back? 
So turn around and I'll pick up the slack 
Take it to the bridge, c'mon 

[Bridge: Justin Timberlake & Timbaland]
Dirty babe 
You see these shackles, baby, I'm your slave

[Intro: Justin Timberlake]
Ain't another woman that can take your spot, my

[Verse 1: Justin Timberlake]
If I wrote you a symphony
Just to say how much you mean to me 
If I told you you were beautiful
Would you date me on the regular? 
Well, baby, I've been around the world
But I ain't seen myself another girl 
This ring here represents my heart
But there's just one thing I need from you 
Because

[Chorus: Justin Timberlake & Timbaland]
I can see us holdin' hands
Walkin' on the beach, our toes in the sand
I can see us on the country side
Sittin' on the grass, layin' side by side
You can be my baby
Let me make you my lady, girl, you amaze me
Ain't gotta do nothin' crazy
See, all I want you to do is be my love 
My love 
My love 
Ain't another woman that could take your spot
My love 
My love 
My love 
Ain't another woman that could take your spot, my love
Love, girl, my love, my love

[Verse 2: Justin Timberlake]
Now If I wrote you a love note
And made you smile at every word I wrote 
Would that make you wanna change your scene
And wanna be the one on my team? 
See, what's the point in waitin' anymore?
'Cause girl, I've never been more sure 
This ring here represents my heart
And everything that you been waitin' for 
Because

[Chorus: Justin Timberlake & Timbaland]
I can see us holdin' hands
Walkin' on the beach, our toes in the sand
I can see us on the country side
Sittin' on the grass, layin' side by side
You can be my baby
Let me make you my lady, girl, you amaze me
Ain't gotta do nothin' crazy
See, all I want you to do is be my love 
My love 
My love 
Ain't another woman that could take your spot
My love 
My love 
My love 
Ain't another woman that could take your spot, my love
Love, my love, my love

[Interlude: T.I.]
Aight, it's time to get it, JT
I don't know what you hesitatin' for, man
Ay, ay, ay

[Verse 3: T.I.]
Shawty cool as a fan, on the move once again 
But he still has fans from Peru to Japan
Hey, listen, baby, I don't wanna ruin your plan 
But if you got a man, try to lose him if you can
'Cause the girls worldwide throw they hands up high
When you wanna come and kick it with a stand-up guy
You don't really wanna let the chance go by
'Cause you ain't been seen with a man so fly
And, babe, with friends so fly, I can go fly
Private, 'cause I handle my B.I
They call me Candle Guy 
Simply 'cause I am on fire 
I hate to have to cancel my vacation, so you can't deny
I'm patient, but I ain't gon' try 
You don't come, I ain't gon' die
Hold up, what you mean you can't go? Why? 
Me and your boyfriend, we ain't no tie 
You say you wanna kick it when I ain't so high 
Baby, it's obvious that I ain't yo' guy
I ain't gon' lie, I'll fill your space
And forget your face, I swear I will
St. Barths, Anguilla, anywhere I chill 
Just bring with me any pair, I will 

[Chorus: Justin Timberlake]
I can see us holdin' hands
Walkin' on the beach, our toes in the sand
I can see us on the country side
Sittin' on the grass, layin' side by side
You can be my baby
Let me make you my lady, girl, you amaze me
Ain't gotta do nothin' crazy
See, all I want you to do is be my love 
My love 
My love 
Ain't another woman that could take your spot
My love 
My love 
My love 
Ain't another woman that could take your spot, my love
Love, love, my love, my love

[Verse 1]
Frequencies so low
Heart on a string
A string that only plays solos
Rain made of echoes
Tidal wave rushing on and on

[Pre-Chorus]
Under the water you scream so loud but the silence surrounds you
But I hear it loud and you fall in the deep and I'll always find you

[Chorus]
If my red eyes don't see you anymore
And I can't hear you through the white noise
Just send your heartbeat I'll go to the blue ocean floor
Where they find us no more
On that blue ocean floor
On that blue ocean floor
On that blue ocean floor
On that blue ocean floor
On that blue ocean floor

[Verse 2]
Shell made out of gold
Found on a beach picked up and you held so close
Rain washed out its glow
Heartbeat steadily leads me down below

[Pre-Chorus]
Under the water you scream so loud but the silence surrounds you
But I hear it loud and you fall in the deep and I'll always find you

[Chorus]
If my red eyes don't see you anymore
And I can't hear you through the white noise
Just send your heartbeat I'll go to the blue ocean floor
Where they find us no more
On that blue ocean floor
On that blue ocean floor
On that blue ocean floor
On that blue ocean floor
On that blue ocean floor

[Bridge]
20,000 leagues away, catch up to you on the same day
Travel at the speed of light, thinking the same thoughts at the same time
Heartbeat set at steady pace, Ill let the rhythm show me the way
No one can find us here, fade out and disappear

[Chorus]
If my red eyes don't see you anymore
And I can't hear you through the white noise
Just send your heartbeat I'll go to the blue ocean floor
Where they find us no more
On that blue ocean floor
On that blue ocean floor
On that blue ocean floor
On that blue ocean floor
On that blue ocean floor

[Intro]
Hey pretty lady
This goes out to you 
I said it like a thousand times
But everyday still feels like the first day

This is dedicated to you, dedicated to you, dedicated to you
Dedicated to you, dedicated to you, dedicated to you
Pretty lady, when you walk on by
It was such such a mellow, mellow, mellow day
When you walk by, sunshine
It was such a mellow, mellow, mellow

[Verse 1]
I, I can't deny the way you caught my eye
Then something strawberry filled up the sky
And everything on you intoxicates
It's a mystery, I don't know why
I let you kick in my do not disturb sign
But I guess your mouth in motion got me so high
And I could tell its pure just by the taste
And you kiss me

[Pre-Chorus]
So tell me you wanna get close somewhere far away, far away
Don't worry about your loving it won't go to waste, go to waste
Don't ever change your flavor 'cause I love the taste
And if you ask me where I wanna go, I say all the way

[Chorus]
'Cause she's just like nothing
That I ever seen before
Baby, please don't change nothing
Because your flavor's so original
And it all started when she said
Hey hey hey, smacking that strawberry bubblegum
You really got me when you said
Hey hey hey, popping that strawberry bubblegum
This goes out to you, this goes out to you

[Verse 2]
So tell me why, we're making love like professionals on the first time
Acting unprofessional but it works out
'Cause you dont wanna work here anyway
And baby I, girl I'm all addicted and I won't fight
You and me that's the recipe for a good time
And it ain't really nothing but clothes in the way

[Pre-Chorus]
So tell me you wanna get close somewhere far away, far away
Don't worry about your loving it won't go to waste, go to waste
Don't ever change your flavor 'cause I love the taste
And if you ask me where I wanna go, I say all the way

[Chorus]
'Cause she's just like nothing
That I ever seen before
Baby, please don't change nothing
Because your flavor's so original
And it all started when she said
Hey hey hey, smacking that strawberry bubblegum
You really got me when you said
Hey hey hey, popping that strawberry bubblegum
This goes out to you, this goes out to you

Come in, sit down, let me elevate your appetite
Any flavor you want. Now my selection is the tasty kind
But you, you're delicious on your own
After I break you down my fingers, it's so sweet
That's what you told me when I touched on your lips
Towel under the door, girl, before they pick up your scent ah

Then I'll be your blueberry lollipop

[Verse 1: Justin Timberlake]
Hey, girl
Is he everything you wanted in a man?
You know I gave you the world
You had me in the palm of your hand
So why your love went away
I just can't seem to understand
Thought it was me and you, baby
Me and you until the end, but I guess I was wrong, uh

[Pre-Chorus: Justin Timberlake]
Don't wanna think about it 
Don't wanna talk about it 
I'm just so sick about it
Can't believe it's endin' this way
Just so confused about it 
Feelin' the blues about it 
I just can't do without ya
Tell me, is this fair?

[Chorus: Justin Timberlake]
Is this the way it's really going down?
Is this how we say goodbye?
Should've known better when you came around
That you were gonna make me cry
It's breakin' my heart to watch you run around
'Cause I know that you're livin' a lie
But that's okay, baby, 'cause in time, you will find

[Refrain: Justin Timberlake]
What goes around, goes around, goes around

What goes around, goes around, goes around
Comes all the way back around
What goes around, goes around, goes around
Comes all the way back around
What goes around, goes around, goes around
Comes all the way back around
Yeah

[Verse 2: Justin Timberlake]
Now, girl
I remember everything that you claimed
You said that you were movin' on now 
And maybe I should do the same 
The funny thing about that is
I was ready to give you my name
Thought it was me and you, baby
And now it's all just a shame and I guess I was wrong, uh

[Pre-Chorus: Justin Timberlake]
Don't wanna think about it 
Don't wanna talk about it 
I'm just so sick about it
Can't believe it's endin' this way
Just so confused about it 
Feelin' the blues about it 
I just can't do without ya
Can you tell me, is this fair?

[Chorus: Justin Timberlake]
Is this the way it's really going down?
Is this how we say goodbye? 
Should've known better when you came around
Should've known better that you were gonna make me cry

[Part II: ...Comes Around ]

[Intro: Justin Timberlake]
Yep, yep, yep, yep
Let me paint this picture for you, baby

[Verse: Justin Timberlake]
You spend your nights alone and he never comes home
And every time you call him, all you get's a busy tone
I heard you found out that he's doin' to you
What you did to me, ain't that the way it goes?
When you cheated, girl, my heart bleeded, girl
So it goes without sayin' that you left me feelin' hurt
Just a classic case, a scenario
Tale as old as time, girl, you got what you deserved

[Pre-Chorus: Justin Timberlake]
And now you want somebody 
To cure the lonely nights 
You wish you had somebody 
That could come and make it right 
But girl, I ain't somebody 
With a lot of sympathy 
You'll see, see

[Chorus: Justin Timberlake & Timbaland]

I thought I told ya, hey

I thought I told ya, hey

I thought I told ya, hey

I thought I told ya, hey


[Outro: Justin Timberlake & Timbaland]

See, you should've listened to me, baby

Hey, hey, hey, hey

Because 
Hahaha

[Verse 1]
Said all I want from you is to see you tomorrow
And every tomorrow
Maybe youll let me borrow, your heart
And is it too much to ask for every Sunday?
And while we're at it, throw in every other day to start

[Pre-Chorus]
I know people make promises all the time
Then they turn right around and break them
When someone cuts your heart open with a knife
Now you're bleeding
But I could be that guy to heal it over time
And I wont stop until you believe it
'Cause baby, youre worth it

[Chorus]
So don't act like its a bad thing to fall in love with me
'Cause you might fuck around and find your dreams come true with me
Spend all your time and your money just to find out that my love was free
So don't act like its a bad thing to fall in love with me, me
Its not a bad thing to fall in love with me, me
Fall, yeah

[Verse 2]
Now how about I be the last voice you hear tonight?
And every other night for the rest of the nights that there are
And every morning I just wanna see you staring back at me 
'Cause I know thats a good place to start

[Pre-Chorus]
I know people make promises all the time
Then they turn right around and break them
When someone cuts your heart open with a knife
Now you're bleeding
 But I could be that guy to heal it over time
And I wont stop until you believe it
'Cause baby, youre worth it

[Chorus]
So don't act like its a bad thing to fall in love with me
'Cause you might fuck around and find your dreams come true with me
Spend all your time and your money just to find out that my love was free
So don't act like its a bad thing to fall in love with me, me
Its not a bad thing to fall in love with me, me
Not such a bad thing to fall in love with me


[Bridge]
No, I wont fill your mind
With broken promises and wasted time
And if you fall, youll always land right in these arms
These arms of mine

[Chorus]
Don't act like its a bad thing to fall in love with me
'Cause you might fuck around and find your dreams come true with me
Spend all your time and your money just to find out that my love was free
So don't act like its a bad thing to fall in love with me, me
Its not a bad thing to fall in love with me, me
Not such a bad thing to fall in love with me

[Intro: Justin Timberlake]
Hey, hey, hey, come on
We're having too much fun right here

[Verse 1: Justin Timberlake]
She's got a secret, but I know
She wanna break it down for me like she tryna get some paper
Who needs a stage with the lights low
'Cause you already dropped the bullet and turned it into something major

[Pre-Chorus: Justin Timberlake]
Now can we discuss how fast you just got undressed
Girl, if sex is a contest, then you're coming first 
Don't rush, go slow, I-I can't lie, I'm impressed
Standing ovation, encore, when love curtains close

[Chorus: Justin Timberlake & ]
It's a cabaret 
'Cause even though I'm a professional, I like to do my work at home
Cabaret 
You giving me everything you got, all I really want now is more



You giving me everything you got, all I really want now is more

[Verse 2: Justin Timberlake]
Fantasy play the role
And all these new moves that I'd like got me feeling like a stranger
Say my name, do you know
'Cause I got you saying Jesus so much, it's like we are laying in the Manger

[Pre-Chorus: Justin Timberlake]
Now can we discuss how fast you just got undressed
Girl, if sex is a contest, then you're coming first 
Don't rush, go slow, I-I can't lie, I'm impressed
Standing ovation, encore, when love curtains close

[Chorus: Justin Timberlake & ]
It's a cabaret 
'Cause even though I'm a professional, I like to do my work at home
Cabaret 
You giving me everything you got, all I really want now is more



You giving me everything you got, all I really want now is more

[Verse 3: Drake]
Okay, this just in girl the paper so long
Always seem like I gotta wait for so long
So long 'til you get off from work, but listen
I got some better positions for you to take in for so long
Always strap up just for safety then go long
Then do my touchdown dance in it no clothes on
We might fuck around and slip tonight
You're Kryptonite, you should probably have a cape to throw on
On my Eddie Murphy Boomerang for ya
Got a bunch of old girls that I threw away for ya
I been in the gym doing two-a-days for ya
So I can lift ya up when I do the thang to ya
D-do do the thing to ya, girl truth be told
You set the pace then you ride it like cruise control
The shit feel so right gotta tell somebody
I just can't decide who should know, Ill keep a secret for ya

[Bridge: Drake]
I'm tryna ease your mind, word to Boosie
Pole in my bedroom that was there when I moved in

[Verse 4: Drake]
Okay fine, I'm a terrible liar
Girl what difference does it make if it was there, or it's mine
You the girl that's gonna be there when it's marrying time
And I'm gonna fuck you like we are having an affair
I swear it's like I'm undercover way I'm cuffing you though
Presidential shit girl you up on the poles
Say this is a private show, oh boy don't start
Keep this whole stripper thing secret in a pole vault
North pole boy from the T.O
They ain't really ready for me and that J.T. though
Cook for ya and then I break it down like a kilo
Got a camera watching our every single move like casinos

[Chorus: Justin Timberlake & ]
It's a cabaret 
'Cause even though I'm a professional, I like to do my work at home
Cabaret 
You giving me everything you got, all I really want now is more



You giving me everything you got, all I really want now is more

But I just want to fly 
I don't want to be the one to alienate, yeah 
You see, I'm trying to find an alien in you  if it's cool, 

[Pre-Chorus]
We can't take an airplane
Where we're going is way too high
Going where the day sky turns into night
I got the windows special tinted for the stars that get too bright
And I saved you a seat, so let's ride

[Chorus]
Hop into my spaceship coupe
There's only room for two 
And with the top down
We'll cruise around
Land and make love on the moon

Hop into my spaceship coupe
There's only room for two 
And with the top off, you're all wrapped up
In my space lover cocoon

[Post-Chorus]
And I love it when I hear you say
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh 
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Sing to me
I love it when I hear you say
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

Now everybody knows that you're from outer space 
But honey, I just want to turn out this space with you 
So drive me to your galaxy where I could play, yeah 
And sugar, I'll take my time
And show you the backseat view,  if it's cool 

[Pre-Chorus]
We can't take an airplane
Where we're going is way too high
Going where the day sky turns into night
I got the windows special tinted for the stars that get too bright
And I saved you a seat, so let's ride

[Chorus 2]
Hop into my spaceship coupe
There's only room for two 
And with the top down
We'll cruise around
Land and make love on the moon
Hop into my spaceship coupe
There's only room for two 
And with the top off, you're all wrapped up
In my space lover cocoon

[Post-Chorus]
And I love it when I hear you say
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

Sing to me

Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

Go on and sing to me
Now break it down

Hey...
This is the part
Where you, and me, and all of the stars collide tonight
This is the part
Where we take off
And then we fly far away, far away, far away

[Chorus]
Hop into my spaceship coupe
There's only room for two 
And with the top down
We'll cruise around
Land and make love on the moon
Hop into my spaceship coupe
There's only room for two 
And with the top off, you're all wrapped up
In my space lover cocoon

Right here next to me
I'm going to take you to the moon
And I'm going to make you say

Ain't no need of stopping, girl
Yeah, there ain't no need of stopping, girl
Yeah, okay

[Verse 1]
Met you out on Broadway on the hottest night in town
We arrived solo but we were being chased around
Saw you being cornered by some guy you used to know
Stepped in between the both of y'all, said "I'm leaving, do you wanna go?"

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause I'll be the light when you can't see
I'll be the wood when you need heat
I'll be the generator, turn me on when you need electricity
Some shit start to go down, I'll be the one with the level head
The world could end now, baby, we'll be living in The Walking Dead

[Chorus]
'Cause I got supplie-ie-ies
Supplie-ie-ies
I got you, I got supplie-ie-ies
Supplie-ie-ies

[Verse 2]
I don't know if you 'member this, but I was out of town
Flew in on a 3 AM just to show up and hear your sounds
The multiple times, stop, hit the set
You ain't had it that way, I can guarantee you that

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause I'll be the light when you can't see
I'll be the wood when you need heat
I'll be the generator, turn me on when you need electricity
Some shit start to go down, I'll be the one with the level head
The world could end now, baby, we'll be living in The Walking Dead

[Chorus]
'Cause I got supplie-ie-ies
Supplie-ie-ies
I got you, I got supplie-ie-ies
Supplie-ie-ies

[Refrain]
Ain't no need of stopping, girl
Can't nobody top it, girl
Ain't no better option, girl 
Ain't nobody stopping, girl
This here when I drop in, girl
I work, work when I clock in, girl 

[Pre-Chorus]
I'll be the light when you can't see
I'll be the wood when you need heat
I'll be the generator, turn me on when you need electricity
Some shit start to go down, I'll be the one with the level head
The world could end now
Baby, we'll be living in The Walking Dead

[Bridge]
Now I wanna know everything
Don't leave a single detail out
I'll get mine later, just fell out
It makes me a generous lover
Ooh, I wanna see everything
So don't leave a single detail out
I want it all on the table
The personal way to, wait

[Refrain]
Ain't no need of stopping, girl
Yeah, there ain't no need of stopping, girl
Yeah, okay

I brag about you to anyone outside
But I'm a man of the woods, it's my pride
I'm sorry baby, you know I try
But I'm a man of the woods, it's my pride

[Verse 1]
Hey, sugar plum, look at where we are
So tonight, if I take it too far, that's okay because you know

I hear the making up's fun
Been a minute since we've had some time to breathe
So if you see another side of me that's okay because you know

I hear the making up's fun

[Pre-Chorus]
But then your hands talking, fingers walking, down your legs
Hey, there's the faucet
Someone's knocking like they know
But baby, don't you stop it, yes I'm watching
Your hand slides down the light
And girl you know

[Chorus]
I brag about you to anyone outside
But I'm a man of the woods, it's my pride
I'm sorry baby, you know I try
But I'm a man of the woods, it's my pride

[Verse 2]
Well, I got your sweet with a twist of lime
And this one's neat, well you know that's mine, here we go
And do it twice 'cause you know we like it
And damn anybody if they disagree
They don't understand you're just like me, they don't know
We do it twice 'cause we know we like it

[Pre-Chorus]
But then your hands talking, fingers walking, down your legs
Hey, there's the faucet
Someone's knocking like they know
But baby, don't you stop it, yes I'm watching
Your hand slides down the light 
And girl you know

[Chorus]
I brag about you to anyone outside
But I'm a man of the woods, it's my pride
I'm sorry baby, you know I try
But I'm a man of the woods, it's my pride

[Bridge]
How do I ever explain what I've got with you?
I try to find the words but they hide and that's the truth
And nobody ever will understand what we do
There's only one me and you
Come here, hold me
'Cause there's only one me and you
Yeah, there's only one me and you, uh
There's only one me and you
You know there's only one me and you

[Chorus]
I brag about you to anyone outside
But I'm a man of the woods, it's my pride
I'm sorry baby, you know I try
But I'm a man of the woods, it's my pride

[Outro]
I wrote this to let you know
And I let them feelings show
I'm the man of the woods and you're my pride
Ooh, I can't make them understand
But you know I'm a Southern man
A man of the woods and you're my pride
Ohh, hey, hey
A man of the woods, it's my pride
Now let the beat ride like...

[Verse 1]
Bittersweet thing, could this be a dream
Or just the same nightmare that keeps me awake?
Feel it in my brain, tall shot of pain
Pour a little out now for the love that we've made

[Pre-Chorus]
I feel it the morning, you're still here in the morning
I see you, but you're gone, telephone the doctor, I'm not okay
The bottom of the bottle to fill this empty heart up
A thousand proof don't change the truth, I dive in, but I can't

[Chorus]
I can't drink you away
I've tried Jack, I've tried Jim, Ive tried all of their friends
But I can't drink you away
All of these rocks, I can't swim outta this skin, I'm livin' in

[Post-Chorus]
Say, now tell me baby, don't they make a medicine for heartbreak?
Tell me baby, now don't they make a medicine for heartbreak?

[Verse 2]
Got that poundin' on my brain, so I drowned it away
When the sun comes up tomorrow, you can find me doin' the same
'Cause I just can't forget, the way we turned out this bad
And now the only thing that sleeps here is a ghost of you instead

[Pre-Chorus]
I feel it the morning, you're still here in the morning
I see you, but you're gone, telephone the doctor, I'm not okay
The bottom of the bottle to fill this empty heart up
A thousand proof don't change the truth, I dive in, but I can't

[Chorus]
I can't drink you away
I've tried Jack, I've tried Jim, Ive tried all of their friends
But I can't drink you away
All of these rocks, I can't swim outta this skin, I'm livin' in

[Post-Chorus]
Say, now tell me baby, don't they make a medicine for heartbreak?
Tell me baby, now don't they make a medicine for heartbreak?

[Bridge]
Break it down
I can't drink you
No, I can't drink you away, away
I can't drink you
I can't drink you away, away
I can't drink you
I can't drink you away, away
I can't drink you
No, I can't drink you away

[Chorus]
I can't drink you away
I've tried Jack, I've tried Jim, Ive tried all of their friends
But I can't drink you away
All of these rocks, I can't swim outta this skin, I'm livin' in

[Post-Chorus]
Say, so tell me baby, don't they make a medicine for heartbreak?
Tell me baby, oh yeah, now don't they make a medicine for heartbreak?
Oh yeah, tell me baby, don't they make a medicine for my heartbreak?
Tell me baby, now don't they make a medicine for my heartbreak?

[Chorus]
I can't drink you away
I've tried Jack, I've tried Jim, Ive tried all of their friends
But I can't drink you away
All of these rocks, I can't swim outta this skin, I'm livin' in

[Verse 1]
Theres something about your body
Im not in a rush
But girl Im ready to marry you
Yeah right here in the restaurant
And start on our honeymoon
While you still got your dress on
While you still got your dress on

[Pre-Chorus]
Now I aint trying to offend nobody
But girl dont they see you
Its cool if they dont
Cus hey I only see me and you
Thats why Im all over you
While you still got your dress on
While you still got your dress on

[Chorus]
I cant wait
Cus girl as soon as I look at your face
I see a world where our heart never breaks
To me that means that the whole world could change but not mine
I cant wait

[Verse 2]
The way I know your body
I dont really need much
Girl I know where to touch
Stay where you are
Drop all your worries
And you can leave all the rest on
We can do it
While you still have your dress on

[Pre-Chorus]
Now I aint trying to offend nobody
But girl dont they see you
Its cool if they dont
Cus hey I only see me and you
Thats why Im all over you
While you still got your dress on
While you still got your dress on

[Chorus]
I cant wait
Cus girl as soon as I look at your face
I see a world where our heart never breaks
To me that means that the whole world could change but not mine
I cant wait

[Verse 3: Timbaland]
Let me take you
So walk with me
Through the beautiful sand as we take pictures
Hips so wide looks like its got whiskers
Let put a solid gold on that solid figure
Go ahead show your pretty dentures
Your pretty physique, your pretty toes
Im pretty with you
I do a good job for that pretty picture
You the prettiest but Im the only thing thats missing

[Chorus]
I cant wait
Cus girl as soon as I look at your face
I see a world where our heart never breaks
To me that means that the whole world could change but not mine
I cant wait[Hook]

[Intro: Pharrell Williams & Justin Timberlake]
Ladies and gentlemen
It's my pleasure to introduce to you
He's a friend of mine
Yes, yes I am
And he goes by the name... Justin
Wooo
All the way from Memphis, Tennessee
And he's got somethin' special for y'all tonight
He's gonna sing a song for y'all about this girl
Come in right here?
Yeah, come on

[Verse 1: Justin Timberlake & Pharrell Williams]
On that sunny day
Didn't know I'd meet
Such a beautiful girl
Walking down the street
Seen those bright brown eyes
With tears coming down 
She deserves a crown
But where is it now?
Mama, listen

[Chorus 1: Justin Timberlake]
Seorita, I feel for you
You deal with things, that you don't have to
He doesn't love ya, I can tell by his charm
But you could feel this real love
If you just lay in my...

[Verse 2: Justin Timberlake]
Running fast in my mind
Girl, don't you slow it down
If we carry on this way
This thing might leave the ground
How would you like to fly?
That's how my queen should ride
But you still deserve the crown
Or hasn't it been found?
Mama, listen

[Chorus 1: Justin Timberlake]
Seorita, I feel for you 
You deal with things, that you don't have to
He doesn't love ya, I can tell by his charm 
But you could feel this real love 
If you just lay in my...

[Chorus 2]
Ah, ah, arms

Ah, ah, arms

Ah, ah, arms

Ah, ah, arms

[Bridge: Justin Timberlake]
When I look into your eyes 
I see something that money can't buy 
And I know if you give us a try 
I'll work harder for you girl 
And no longer will you ever have to cry 

[Chorus 1: Justin Timberlake]
Seorita, I feel for you
You deal with things , that you don't have to

He doesn't love ya, I can tell by his charm
But you could feel this real love 

[Chorus 2: Justin Timberlake]
If you just lay in my...
Ah, ah, arms
Ah, ah, arms

Ah, ah, arms 
Ah, ah, arms

[Bridge: Justin Timberlake]
When I look into your eyes 
I see something that money can't buy 
And I know if you give us a try 
I'll work harder for you girl 
And no longer will you ever have to cry

[Interlude: Justin Timberlake]
Now listen
I wanna try somethin' right now
See, they don't do this anymore
I'mma sing something
And I want the guys to sing with me
They go:
"It feels like something's heating up, can I leave with you?"
And then the ladies go:
"I don't know what I'm thinking 'bout, really leaving with you"
Guys sing:
It feels like something's heating up, can I leave with you?
And ladies:
"I don't know what I'm thinking 'bout, really leaving with you"
Feels good, don't it? Come on
"It feels like something's heating up, can I leave with you?"
Yeah, ladies
"I don't know what I'm thinking 'bout, really leaving with you"

Sing it one more time:
"It feels like something's heating up, can I leave with you?"
And ladies:
"I don't know what I'm thinking 'bout, really leaving with you"
"It feels like something's heating up, can I leave with you?"
Ladies:
"I don't know what I'm thinking 'bout, really leaving with you"

[Outro: Justin Timberlake]
Gentlemen, goodnight
Ladies, good morning
And that's it

[Verse 1: Justin]
I woke up this morning
And heard the TV saying something
About disaster in the world and
It made me wonder where I'm going
There's so much darkness in the world
But I see beauty left in you, girl
And what you give me let me know that I'll be alright

[Chorus: Justin]
'Cause if your love was all I had, in this life
Well, that would be enough until the end of time
So rest your weary heart and relax your mind
'Cause I'm gonna love you, girl, until the end of time

[Refrain: Justin]
You got me singing 
Ohh oh oh oh oh oh whoa yeah
Everybody sing 
Everybody singing 

[Verse 2: Beyonc]
Now if you ever wondering
About the way I'm feeling
Well, baby boy, there ain't no question
Just to be around you is a blessing
Sick and tired of trying to save the world
I just wanna spend my time being your girl
And what you give me lets me know that we'll be alright

[Chorus: Beyonc]
'Cause if your love was all I had 
In this life 
That will be enough  until the end of time

Rest your weary heart  and relax your mind 
'Cause I'm gonna love you, boy 
Until the end of time

[Refrain: Beyonc]
Boy you got me singing 
You got me singing 
Everybody singing 
Everybody singing 

[Bridge: Justin + Beyonc]

Break it down one more time, Justin
Ohh oh oh oh oh oh oh yeah 
Ohh oh oh oh oh oh oh

[Outro: Justin]
'Cause if your love was all I had, in this life
That would be enough until the end of time

[Verse 1: Justin Timberlake]
Walking around middle of the night
Might end a man's life with that innocent face
Cause everything below your neck killin' everything next
It's murder, murder
You say I need to watch out, something might go down, good
I really wanna take this under the ground, under the ground
And I'mma be down to go to that level
And even when you speak regular a sick freak, girl, I say ok
So come on and leave me cause the deeper you take me the better
You killin' me softly but we can go as hard as you want to
Bed's way under the ground, under the ground
And I'll be down and throw it at that level

[Chorus: Justin Timberlake]
Ooooh, that girl is murder 
Ooooh, that girl is murder 
Under the lights and sound
Everybody get down, down
You know that she's a killer
Watch it get down, watch it get down
Watch it get down, watch it get down
Murder...

[Verse 2: Justin Timberlake]
You dancing around, hanging out the window
Talking real big with your little slim waist
And with all that below your waist
Girl, you know the next scene is murder
Maybe you need to watch out something might go down
Girl, your body is gonna end up
Under the ground, under the ground
I would be down to go to that level
And even when you dress regular a freak chick
Girl, you complement my taste
So girl don't be stingy the more that you give me the better
You know you killin' me softly but we can go as hard as you want to
Until the bed's way under the ground, under the ground
I would be down to go to that level

[Chorus: Justin Timberlake]
Ooooh, that girl is murder 
Ooooh, that girl is murder 
Under the lights and sound
Everybody get down, down
You know that she's a killer
Watch it get down, watch it get down
Watch it get down, watch it get down
Murder...

[Verse 3: JAY Z]
Yoko Ono, she got that Yoko Ono
You know that shit that made John Lennon go solo
Know that shit gotta be lethal
If that pussy broke up The Beatles
Chocha ruined pop culture
All them player days is over
Got me buying Rovers, rings
Jumping over brooms and church rooms, kaboom
That bomb, that P
It's a problem call the police
Red bottoms, white sheets, that's murder, she a beast
Faces of death, she fine or what
Suicide, I'm trying to cut
White chalk, line 'em up
Give new meaning to dying to fuck

[Chorus: Justin Timberlake]
Ooooh, that girl is murder 
Ooooh, that girl is murder 
Under the lights and sound
Everybody get down, down
You know that she's a killer
Watch it get down, watch it get down
Watch it get down, watch it get down
Murder...

[Outro: Timbaland]
I line 'em up, she shoot 'em down
I line 'em up, she shoot 'em down
I line 'em up, she shoot 'em down
I line 'em up, she shoot 'em down
[Chorus: Justin Timberlake]
Don't be so quick to walk away

See, I've been watching you
I like the way you move
So go ahead, girl, just do
That ass shaking thing you do

[Pre-Chorus: Justin Timberlake]
So you grab your girls
And you grab a couple more
And you all come meet me
In the middle of the floor
Said the air is thick, it's smelling right
So you pass to the left and you sail to the right

[Chorus: Justin Timberlake]
Don't be so quick to walk away
Dance with me

Pull you close and share my groove

[Pre-Chorus: Justin Timberlake]

Talk to me, boy
Hurry up 'cause you're taking too long
Talk to me, boy

[Bridge: Vanessa Marquez, Justin Timberlake and Both]
So what did you come for?
I came to dance with you
And you know that you don't wanna hit the floor
I came to romance with you
You're searching for love forever more
It's time to take a chance
If love is here on the floor, girl

[Interlude: Justin Timberlake]
Hey

[Chorus: Justin Timberlake]

[Intro: Justin Timberlake]
Just somethin' 'bout you...
Way I'm lookin' at you, whatever
You keep lookin' at me
You gettin' scared now, right?
Don't feel me baby, it's just Justin
It feel good, right?
Listen

[Verse 1: Justin Timberlake]
I kinda noticed, something wasn't right
From your colorful face
It's kind of weird to me
Since you're so fine
If it's up to me, your face will change

[Pre-Chorus: Justin Timberlake]
If you smile then that should set the tone
Just be limber
And if you let go, the music should move your bones
Just remember
Sing a song to me

[Chorus: Justin Timberlake]
Ain't nobody love you like I love you
You're a good girl and that's what makes me trust ya 
Late at night, I talk to you
You will know the difference when I touch you

[Verse 2: Justin Timberlake]
See, people are so phony
Nosy 'cause they're lonely
Aren't you sick of the same thing?
They say so and so was dating
Love you or they're hatin'
When it doesn't matter anyway
'Cause we're here tonight

[Pre-Chorus: Justin Timberlake]
If you smile, then that should set the tone
Just be limber, baby
And if you let go, the music should move your bones
Baby, just remember
Sing a song to me

[Chorus: Justin Timberlake]
Ain't nobody love you like I love you
You're a good girl and that's what makes me trust ya 
Late at night, I talk to you
You will know the difference when I touch you

[Verse 3: Justin Timberlake]
Yeah, you know I can make ya happy
I could change your life
If you give me that chance to be your man

If you give me that chance to be your man

And then..

[Bridge: Justin Timberlake]
Maybe we'll fly the night away 
Girl 
Maybe we'll fly the night away 
Girl

[Verse 4: Pusha T, Malice, ]
Ma, whatchu wanna do?
I'm in front of you
Grab a friend see, I can have fun with two
Or me and you put on a stage show
In the mall kids ask "How the chain glow?"
Point to her they say, "Wow, it's the same glow"
Point to me I say, "Yeah, it's the same dough"
We the same type, you my a-like
You have me sleepin' in the same bed every night
Go ride wit me you deservin' the best
Take a few shots, let it burn in your chest
We could ride down, pumpin' N.E.R.D. in the deck
Funny how a few words turn into sex
Play number three, joint called "Brain" 
Ma, took a hint, make me swerve in the lane
The name Malicious and I burn every track
Clipse and J. Timberlake - now how heavy is that?

[Bridge: Justin Timberlake]
Maybe we'll fly the night away 
Girl 
Maybe we'll fly the night away 
Girl
Oh

[Chorus: Justin Timberlake]
Ain't nobody love you like I love you 
You're a good girl and that's what makes me trust ya like I do 
Late at night, I talk to you 
You will know the difference when I...

[Outro: Justin Timberlake]
Break it down
You know, I used to dream about this when I was a little boy
I never thought it would end up this way, drums 
It's kind of special right? Yeah
You know, you think about it
Sometimes people, just destined
Destined to do what they do
And that's what it is
Now everybody dance...

[Intro: Justin Timberlake]
Yeah, uh, feels good, don't it? Listen, uh

[Pre-Chorus: Justin Timberlake]
I wanna do something right
But we can do something better

[Ad-lib Outro]

[Verse 1]
Keeps coming closer
I dont, but she thinks I know her
Beautiful smile with those sad eyes
That was my type
Amnesia thats over
I can see your breathing, girl, is colder
I can see you need me but I dont care
My whole memory of me and love
Gone so far from me, girl
Its not fair
I could feel it almost start to change 
But then it hurts too much
Thats when it starts to fade

[Chorus]
So cold, baby, now Im going crazy
I dont know why you need me alone
If it was true, if it was you
Dont you think?
Dont you think I would know?
Amnesia, every memory fades away till its gone
Where did you go?
Amnesia, went from everything to nothing
No we anymore, shes a stranger that I used to know

[Verse 2]
Now, these photos of us
So happy, so in love
Tell me what happened
Who are they? Where did they go?
And when was enough, enough
When did all the fire turn colder?
When did your heart start to beat slower?
My whole memory of me in love,is gone so far from me, It's not fair
And I can feel it almost start to change 
But it just hurts to much, I let it go away

[Chorus]
So cold, baby, now Im going crazy
I dont know why you need me alone
If it was true, if it was you
Dont you think?
Dont you think I would know?
Amnesia, every memory fades away till its gone
Where did you go?
Amnesia, went from everything to nothing
No we anymore, shes a stranger that I used to know
I can feel it almost start to change 
But then it hurts too much I let it go away uuuh

[Bridge]
So cold, baby , now Im going crazy
I dont know why you need me alone
If it was true, if it was you
Dont you think?
Dont you think I would know?
Amnesia, every memory fades away till its gone
Where did you go?
Amnesia, everything and nothing
No we anymore shes a stranger
Amnesia, every memory fades away till its gone
Where did you go?
Amnesia, everything and nothing
No we anymore shes a stranger that I used to know
And I dont know you anymore
Everything to nothing
Everything to nothing
Shes a stranger that I used to know
Amnesia, amnesia, amnesia

[Outro]
Go on and tear me apart
And do it again tomorrow
I almost forgot
Who you are
I try to forget about it every time I see ya, See ya
Thought I could do without it
Now I know I need ya, need ya
This is turning into some kind of fucking amnesia, I need ya
Memories fade away
Love is so insane
I try to forget about it, every time I see ya, see ya
Thought I could do without it
Now I know I need ya, need ya
This is turning into some kind of fucking amnesia, I need ya
Memories fade away
Love is so insane
So tear me apart and do it again tomorrow
I almost forgot who we are
Ill let you drive me crazy for another day
Isnt this love insane, insane? Yeah

[Verse 1]
I woke up this morning
And heard the TV saying something
About disaster in the world and
It made me wonder where I'm going
There's so much darkness in the world
But I see beauty left in you, girl
And what you give me let's me know that I'll be alright

[Chorus]
'Cause if your love was all I had, in this life
Well, that would be enough until the end of time
So rest your weary heart and relax your mind
'Cause I'm gonna love you, girl, until the end of time

[Refrain]
You've got me singing
Oh whoa, yeah
Oh whoa, yeah
Everybody sing
Oh whoa, yeah
Everybody singing
Oh whoa, yeah

[Verse 2]
Now if you're ever wondering
About the way I'm feeling
Well, baby girl, there ain't no question
Just to be around you is a blessing
Sick and tired of trying to save the world
I just want to spend my time with you, girl
And what you give me
Lets me know that we'll be alright

[Chorus]
'Cause if your love was all I had , in this life
 that would be enough until the end of time
Rest your weary heart  and relax your mind

'Cause I'm gonna love you, girl, until the end of time

Uh, stress is cruel, fame's a lie
But you're special, on every level
Success is cool, money is fine
But you're special, another level

[Verse 1]
Listen
I see the man, they wanna touch ya
That's when I tell 'em, "Uh-uh"
I guess I am a jealous lover
'Cause I ain't sharin' with another

[Refrain]
Uh, stress is cruel, fame's a lie
But you're special, on every level
Success is cool, money is fine
But you're special, another level

[Verse 2]
I guess you can say I was lovestruck
I met you, you was with your brother
I had to go and get my cousin
Tell a joke and then say, "What's up?"
We both danced to "Lucky Star"
Eyeing each other, then we're laughin'
I might as well have been some butter
Melting all over, girl, what?
Ooh, you are that thunder, lightnin'
I need it to get out the darkness
My body told me I was done, but
I think it meant to say in trouble

[Bridge]
If it's for you, it can't be any old thing

You said get used to change
Nothing would be the same
And we're climbing once again
Gettin' higher, higher, higher
To them we might look strange
It's somethin' you can't explain
And we're climbing once again
Gettin' higher, higher, higher
We're climbing, more to gain
Gettin' higher, higher, higher
We're climbing, more to gain
Gettin' higher, higher, higher

I open up my eyes
And I say to myself, "In the whole wide world of guys
I must be the luckiest alive"

[Chorus: Justin Timberlake]
Because I'm in love with you
Laying here, in the morning light
And all I want to do is hold you tight, just one more night

Do you remember
The 21st night of September?
Love was changing the minds of pretenders
While chasing the clouds away

[Verse 1: Anna Kendrick]
Our hearts were ringing
In the key that our souls were singing
As we danced in the night
Remember how the stars stole the night away

[Chorus: Earth, Wind & Fire]
Ba de ya - say do you remember
Ba de ya - dancing in September

Holding hands with your heart to see you
Only blue talk and love
Remember how we knew love was here to stay

Only blue talk and love
Remember, the true love we share today

[Chorus: Earth, Wind & Fire]

And the father is a son, who has a mother
The mother has a daughter
Who gets married to the brother of a mother

They get up every day to go to work for someone else
And somebody works for them
And so, they think they've got it made
But they're all just working to get paid the very same

[Chorus]
And so, they keep on twiddlin' them thumbs

It never ends 'til the end, and then you start again

[Verse 1]
You like New York City in the daytime
I like New York City in the nighttime
You say you like sleeping with the air off
I don't, I need it on
You like the light coming through the windows
I sleep late, so I just keep 'em all closed
You ignore the music on the radio
I don't, I sing along

[Pre-Chorus]
I don't ask for you to change, baby, no, no, no
And you don't ask for me to change

[Chorus]
Tell me how we're not alike
But we work so well and we don't even know why
Funny how the stars crossed right
'Cause we work so well and we don't even know why
You can call it fire and ice
But we work so well and we don't even know why
We don't even know why, no, no
We don't even know why, no, no, no

[Post-Chorus]
No, no, no, no
We like it in the daytime
We like it in the end of time
No, no, no, no
We like it in the daytime
We like it in the end of time

Cold outside and you're just in a T-shirt
I have cold blood even in a sweater
You start your night sippin' by the Kilo
I don't, I know you know

I don't ask for you to change, baby, no, no, no
And you don't ask for me to change

[Chorus]
Tell me how we're not alike
But we work so well and we don't even know why
Funny how the stars crossed right
'Cause we work so well and we don't even know why
You can call it fire and ice
But we work so well and we don't even know why
We don't even know why, no, no 
We don't even know why, no, no, no

[Post-Chorus]
No, no, no, no
We like it in the daytime 
We like it in the end of time 
No, no, no, no
We like it in the daytime

We like it in the end of time

[Bridge]
Somehow, we end up on the same side
And you wouldn't think that we'd be alright
Even our eyes are different colors, but we see fine
Somehow, we end up on the same side 
And you wouldn't think that we'd be alright

Even our eyes are different colors, but we see fine

[Chorus]
 Tell me how we're not alike
But we work so well and we don't even know why

Funny how the stars crossed right
'Cause we work so well and we don't even know why

You can call it fire and ice
But we work so well and we don't even know why

We don't even know why, no, no
We don't even know why, no, no, no

[Verse 1]
Your eyes crashin' into my eyes
Was I accidentally falling in love?
Your words didn't mean to heal the hurt
We're coincidentally more than enough

[Pre-Chorus 1]
All these days, I never thought
That I would need someone so much
Who knew?
But I don't think I ever planned
For this helpless circumstance with you

[Chorus]
You're scared, I'm nervous
But I guess that we did it on purpose
On purpose, on purpose
Baby, I know it's weird, but it's worth it
'Cause I guess that we did it on purpose
On purpose, on purpose

[Post-Chorus]
 Hey, huh
Hey, huh, hey, huh, hey
But I guess that we did it on purpose
 Hey, huh
Hey, huh, hey, huh, hey
But I guess that we did it on purpose

[Verse 2]
My dreams running into your dreams
It's as if we wished on the same star
And my time changing all of your time
It's a butterfly effect on my heart

[Pre-Chorus]
All these days, I never thought
That I would need someone so much
Who knew? Who knew?
But I don't think I ever planned
For this helpless circumstance with you
Oh, whoa

[Chorus]
You're scared, I'm nervous
But I guess that we did it on purpose
On purpose, on purpose
Baby, I know it's weird, but it's worth it
'Cause I guess that we did it on purpose
On purpose, on purpose

[Post-Chorus]
 Hey, huh 
Hey, huh, hey, huh, hey
But I guess that we did it on purpose
 Hey, huh
Hey, huh, hey, huh, hey
But I guess that we did it on purpose

Lost in darkness
You're my focus
Love me hopeless
But I guess that we did it on purpose
Lost in darkness
You're my focus
Love me hopeless
Oh, you're scared

[Chorus]
You're scared, I'm nervous
But I guess that we did it on purpose
On purpose, on purpose
Baby, I know it's weird, but it's worth it
'Cause I guess that we did it on purpose
On purpose, on purpose

[Outro]
Lost in darkness
You're my focus
Love me hopeless
But I guess that we did it on purpose
Lost in darkness
You're my focus
Love me hopeless
But I guess that we did it on purpose

[Verse 1]
Remember when you said it, there's no second chance?
Oh, baby, I heard you been hoping you could change the past
You miss the long goodnights, you miss the long goodbyes
You miss the long goodnights 
Well, did you ever think that it was hard for me
To walk it off like nothing happened, nonchalantly?
I got you feeling like, I got you feeling right
I got you feeling like 

[Pre-Chorus]
That's my shape, I made the shadow
That's my name, don't wear it out though
Feelin' myself can't be illegal, illegal

[Chorus]
So sue me for looking too pretty tonight
Wearing your favorite color under the lights
For moving on, doing everything right
So sue me for being good friends with your friends
And running into you the place that we met
For being something you can't forget
So sue me

[Verse 2]
It's hard to see me on when you've been off as hell
But I'm not gonna dull myself because you dull yourself
I know it's hard to see what you don't want to see
I know it's hard to see 

[Pre-Chorus]
That's my shape, I made the shadow
That's my name, don't wear it out though
Feelin' myself can't be illegal, illegal

[Chorus]
So sue me for looking too pretty tonight
Wearing your favorite color under the lights
For moving on, doing everything right
So sue me for being good friends with your friends
And running into you the place that we met
For being something you can't forget
So sue me

[Bridge]
I, I, I, I guess I'm hard to ignore
Pick up that jaw off the floor

[Chorus]
So sue me for looking too pretty tonight
Wearing your favorite color under the lights
For moving on, doing everything right

So sue me for being good friends with your friends

And running into you the place that we met

For being something you can't forget

So sue me

[Outro]
Sue me, baby

[Intro]
Ah yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse 1]
The moment when the light is red before the go
The moment when the curtain's down before the show
The moment when you're done, but maybe just one more
That's how I feel before I get you all alone

[Pre-Chorus]
We could give it a minute
But what's the fun in a minute?
When we could push all the limits, ah yeah
Shirt hanging off my shoulders
Both hands wanna hold you
So baby, what's the hold up?
Yeah, yeah

[Chorus]
Can you feel the tension rising?
Now you're, now you're getting it close
Now you're, now you're getting it close
Almost love, it's almost love
Speed this up 'cause I'm excited
No more, no more taking it slow
No more, no more taking it slow
Almost love, it's almost love

[Post-Chorus]
Almost love
Almost love, but it could be love
Almost love
Almost love, but it could be love
Almost lo-lo-love
Almost love, but it could be love
It could be love, it could be

[Verse 2]
I want you like a midnight hour wants a view
I want you like a loner wants an empty room
I want you like a kiss that's long and overdue
I need you more than I have ever needed you

[Pre-Chorus]
And we could give it a minute
But what's the fun in a minute?
When we could push all the limits, ah yeah
Shirt hanging off my shoulders
Both hands wanna hold you
So baby, what's the hold up?
Yeah

[Chorus]
Can you feel the tension rising?
Now you're, now you're getting it close
Now you're, now you're getting it close
Almost love, it's almost love
Speed this up 'cause I'm excited
No more, no more taking it slow
No more, no more taking it slow
Almost love, it's almost love

[Post-Chorus]
Almost love
It's almost love, but it could be love
Almost love
Almost love, but it could be love
Almost lo-lo-lo-lo-love
Almost love, but it could be love
It could be love
It could be, yeah, oh no

[Bridge]
We could give it a minute
But what's the fun in a minute?

[Chorus]
Can you feel the tension rising?
Now you're getting it so close
Now you're getting this so close
Almost love, almost love
Oh, 'cause I'm excited
No more, no more taking it slow
No more, no more taking it slow
It's almost love

[Post-Chorus]
Almost love, oh baby
It's almost love, but it could be love
'Cause it's almost love, but it could be love
Almost love and you know
Almost love
But it could be love
'Cause it's almost love, but it could be love
Yeah, it could be love, eh

[Chorus]
 Our love is running into a burning building
 Our love is scattered ash with a burnt up feeling
Feel the heat, so we started running
You know you saw it coming
But the memories are still in my mind
Burning like smoke and fire

[Verse 1]
Rumors spread like wildfire
I held a strong ground
But I've been burning down
'Cause it's like fire is all I hear about
And we are fading out
Don't wanna turn out the light
But it's like...

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm no firefighter
I just need to breathe tonight
So sound the alarm, and there goes the night

[Chorus]
 Our love is running into a burning building
 Our love is scattered ash with a burnt up feeling
Feel the heat, so we started running
You know you saw it coming
But the memories are still in my mind
Burning like smoke and fire

[Verse 2]
Secrets in a small town, they always get around
But the flame has been put out
And I am hearing all the small talk
They whisper as I walk
In a house that's boarded up
So good luck

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm no firefighter
I just need to breathe tonight
So sound the alarm, and there goes the night

[Chorus]
 Our love is running into a burning building
 Our love is scattered ash with a burnt up feeling
Feel the heat, so we started running
You know you saw it coming
But the memories are still in my mind
Burning like smoke and fire

[Bridge]
Smoke and fire, smoke and fire
Don't you know that if there's smoke, there's fire?
Smoke there's fire, smoke there's fire
Now, now
 And now it's over
 I'm getting colder
 And it's the feeling
Like running into a burning building
Rumors spread like wildfire
I held a strong ground
But I've been burning down

[Chorus]
 Our love is running into a burning building
 Our love is scattered ash with a burnt up feeling
Feel the heat, so we started running
You know you saw it coming
But the memories are still in my mind
Burning like smoke and fire

[Outro]
Smoke and fire, smoke and fire
Don't you know that if there's smoke, there's fire?
Smoke there's fire, smoke there's fire
Now, now
 And now it's over
 I'm getting colder
 I'm so tired
Burning like smoke and fire

[Verse 1]
Who put the baby in charge?
It's already hard to buy all the parts and learn to use them
Who put the world on my back and not in my hands?
Just give me a chance

[Pre-Chorus]
Listen to my mama, listen to my dad
Listen to my sisters, everyone relax
Everybody answers shit I didn't ask
Think I'm reaching my limit

[Chorus]
Can I exhale for a minute?
Can I get this out in the open?
Can I sit down for a second?
Can I breathe?
Can I exhale for a minute?
Can we talk it out? I don't get it
Can I calm down for a moment?
Can I breathe for just one second?

[Verse 2]
I put too much weight on words and glances
I, I put too much weight on situations
I, I put too much on myself
Thinking I don't deserve what I've earned, but yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
I listen to the labels, listen to the man
Try to keep a sense of knowing who I am
I try to be an angel, but I don't think I can
Think I'm reaching my limits, yeah

[Chorus]
Can I exhale for a minute?
Can I get this out in the open?
Can I sit down for a second?
Can I breathe?
Can I exhale for a minute?
Can we talk it out? I don't get it
Can I calm down for a moment?
Can I breathe for just one second, baby?

[Bridge]
Can I breathe?
Can I breathe?
Can I breathe?
Can I breathe?
Can I breathe?
Can I breathe?

[Outro]
Na na na, na na na, nay
Na na na, na na na, nay
Na na na, na na na, nay
Na na na, na na na, nay
Na na na, na na na
Na na na na na na

[Verse 1]
If I asked that boy to jump, I know he would
He don't even have to say, it's understood
He treat me nice, he treat me right, he treat me good
Still I get so hesitant, still I get so hesitant
So I took myself where I think I should be
Something told me that it's waiting here for me
Parisian nights, Parisian high, Parisian breeze
Feeding me like medicine, feeding me like medicine, yeah

[Chorus]
It's so romantic in Paris
Won't even try to compare it
Thought I was sure that I'd find it
But I already have love in L.A
It's so romantic in Paris
Won't even try to compare it
Thought I was sure that I'd find it
But I already have love in L.A
Yeah, I already have love in L.A

[Verse 2]
If you show me too much love, it makes me leave
Guess that's one of many things thats wrong with me
Looking past you when you're right in front of me
I won't do that anymore, I won't do that anymore
Why'd it take so long for me to know this?
Scared to put the water with the roses
Halfway 'cross the world for me to notice
But I notice, yeah, I notice, yeah

[Chorus]
It's so romantic in Paris
Won't even try to compare it
Thought I was sure that I'd find it
But I already have love in L.A
It's so romantic in Paris
Won't even try to compare it
Thought I was sure that I'd find it
But I already have love in L.A

[Bridge]
Je ne voulais pas trouver l'amour
Mais Paris a quelque chose
Qui donne envie d'aimer, d'aimer passionment
Mon coeur est  toi pour toujours
You will always have my heart

[Chorus]
It's so romantic in Paris
Won't even try to compare it
Thought I was sure that I'd find it
But I already have love in L.A. 
It's so romantic in Paris 
Won't even try to compare it 
Thought I was sure that I'd find it
But I already have love in L.A
Its so romantic in Paris, babe
Wont even try to compare it 
Thought I was sure that Id find it 
But I already have love in L.A
But I already have love in L.A

[Verse 1]
Little things become everything
When you wouldn't think that they would
Little things weigh so heavily
Take my energy til it's gone

[Pre-Chorus]
I wanna be alone
But all these emotions won't leave me alone
Im tryin', I'm tryin', I'm tryin'
To stop the losing all control
Hypothetically, I could let it go easy

[Chorus]
But I'm still, I'm still
Im still, Im still, I'm still
In my bed about it
Im still, I'm still, I'm still
In my head about it
I'm not usually like this
Im not usually like this
But I'm still, I'm still, I'm still
In my bed

[Verse 2]
Turn this pillowcase to the cooler side
Give me something I can feel
'Cause I wanna turn a page, wanna rearrange
Swing the doors wide open in my mind, no

[Pre-Chorus]
I wanna be alone 
But all these emotions won't leave me alone 
I'm tryin', I'm tryin', I'm tryin'
To stop the losing all control 
But hypothetically, I could let it go easy

[Chorus]
But I'm still, I'm still
I'm still, I'm still, I'm still
In my bed about it 
I'm still, I'm still, I'm still
In my head about it 
I'm not usually like this
I'm not usually like this
But I'm still, I'm still, I'm still
In my bed about it

[Post-Chorus]

But I'm still, I'm still, I'm still
In my bed about it

But I'm still, I'm still, I'm still
In my bed about it

[Bridge]
Something chemical inside me messin' with my mind
And I can't help but feel like
I'm feeling like someone else 
Something animal inside me
Trying to remind me there's no need
To worry about it and lose myself

[Chorus]
But I'm still, I'm still, I'm still
I'm still, I'm still, I'm still
In my bed about it
I'm still, I'm still, I'm still
In my head about it 
I'm not usually like this 
I'm not usually like this 
But I'm still, I'm still, I'm still
In my bed about it

[Outro]
I'm still in my bed, I'm still in my bed 

I'm still in my bed
But I'm still, I'm still
I'm still in my bed about it 
I'm still in my bed, I'm still in my

But I'm still, I'm still, I'm still
In my bed

[Verse 1]
I'm standing on the edge
And everything I know has blown away
Life is upside down
But any way it goes, I'll work it out

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, here we go

One, two, three

[Chorus]
I'm ready for tomorrow
Tomorrow starts today
There ain't a map to follow
But I'm with you all the way
I'm ready for tomorrow
Tomorrow starts today
There ain't a map to follow
But I'm with you all the way

[Verse 2]
I'm looking straight ahead into the unknown
I'm not afraid
This ride has just begun
I'll take the highs and lows
So bring it on

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, here we go

One, two, three

[Chorus]
I'm ready for tomorrow
Tomorrow starts today
There ain't a map to follow
But I'm with you all the way
I'm ready for tomorrow
Tomorrow starts today
There ain't a map to follow
But I'm with you all the way
All the way

[Bridge]
Sometimes life's a roller coaster
Takes you up-up-up
And then it spins you 'round
So throw your hands up in the air
And go all 
Make it count 

[Chorus]
I'm ready for tomorrow
Tomorrow starts today
There ain't a map to follow
But I'm with you all the way
I'm ready for tomorrow
Tomorrow starts today
There ain't a map to follow
But I'm with you all the way
I'm ready for tomorrow 
There ain't a map to follow 
I'm ready for tomorrow
Tomorrow starts today
There ain't a map to follow
But I'm with you all the way
All the way

[Verse 1]
What, what, what, whatcha say, Mr. Clean?
I'm flagging you down for a misdemeanor
It must look different from your mezzanine
You got me, got me feeling out of touch, Hall & Oates
Push it out, wish me luck

[Pre-Chorus]
You got a way, you're messing with my faith
You're tryna paint a picture but you're running out of paint
You had your say 'til I took it away
Out of yours in my controlla

[Chorus]
I'm pushing 20, got no time for others 
I'm pushing 20, got no time for others 
Who ain't on the same wave, yeah, on the same page
Tryna tell me what to be, yeah, tell me what to think
I'm pushing 20, got no time for others 
I'm pushing 20, got no time for others 
Who ain't on the same wave, yeah, on the same page
Tryna tell me what to be, yeah, tell me what to think

[Verse 2]
I'm pushing 20, I ain't talking 'bout a Bimmer
And while you're wasting time, the money's in the meter
So I can start from scratch, make you a believer
Or I can just, da da da
Act like I don't give a, uh

[Pre-Chorus]
You got a way, you're messing with my faith
You're tryna paint a picture but you're running out of paint
You had your say 'til I took it away
Out of yours in my controlla

[Chorus]
I'm pushing 20, got no time for others 
I'm pushing 20, got no time for others 
Who ain't on the same wave, yeah, on the same page
Tryna tell me what to be, yeah, tell me what to think
I'm pushing 20, got no time for others 
I'm pushing 20, got no time for others 
Who ain't on the same wave, yeah, on the same page
Tryna tell me what to be, yeah, tell me what to think

[Bridge]
I got no time, I got no time
No, no, no, no rewind
No, no rewind, yeah
I got no time, I got no time 
No, no, no, no rewind 
No, no rewind

[Chorus]
I'm pushing 20, got no time for others 
I'm pushing 20, got no time for others 
Who ain't on the same wave, yeah, on the same page
Tryna tell me what to be, yeah, tell me what to think 
I'm pushing 20, got no time for others 
I'm pushing 20, got no time for others 
Who ain't on the same wave, yeah, on the same page
Tryna tell me what to be, yeah, tell me what to think

[Outro]
I got no time, I got no time
No, no, no, no rewind
No, no rewind, yeah 
I got no time, I got no time 
No, no, no, no rewind 
No, no rewind

[Intro]
Oh
Oh, yeah

[Verse 1]
Did I catch your attention?
You look like you lost your breath, huh
When I circle the room, you an owl, you gon' twist your head
Don't you come at me green with an attitude
When my lips and my soles are red
If I leave you behind, you can look for the broken necks
No, no

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause I've been here once or twice
Never worry 'bout the eyes 

[Chorus]
Don't just stand there staring, honey
Try to move your feet
If you think they're looking at you
They looking at me
I could make it nice and easy
I'ma take the lead
They ain't even looking at you, baby
They looking at me

[Post-Chorus]
They looking at me
Yeah, yeah, they looking at me

[Verse 2]
Yes, I'm young for a teacher, I'll teach you what you don't know

But I can't give it up all at once, you would overdose
Don't you bring any bull in the room tonight
It's a whole new rodeo
It could be you and me, but you know that I'll steal the show
Oh 

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause I've been here once or twice

Never worry 'bout the eyes
Never worry 'bout the eyes 

[Chorus]
Don't just stand there staring, honey
Try to move your feet
If you think they're looking at you
They looking at me
I could make it nice and easy
I'ma take the lead 
They ain't even looking at you, baby
They looking at me

[Post-Chorus]
They looking at me

Yeah, yeah, they looking at me
But they looking at me, babe
'Cause they looking at me, baby

[Bridge]
Looking at me
Looking at me
Hey
If I leave you behind, you can look for the broken necks


[Chorus]
Don't just stand there staring, honey
Try to move your feet 
If you think they're looking at you
They looking at me
I could make it nice and easy
I'ma take the lead
They ain't even looking at you, baby
They looking at me

[Post-Chorus]

They looking at me

Yeah, yeah, they looking at me

Don't you know that they looking at me?

They looking at me

[Verse 1]
I don't wanna buy what they're sellin' these days
Sayin' feelin' and fallin' is all a mistake
No, no
And why does everybody look at young hearts feeling love
Like it's just a matter of time before they break?
No, no

[Pre-Chorus]
They started sayin', "When you can't hide, run"
"When you can't run, hide"
Started thinkin' love's a loaded gun
Nobody wants to fight
And when did we all start thinkin' that the world
Stop spinnin' in a kiss goodnight?
And when did our heartbeat beatin' too fast
Stop meanin' it was worth the while?

[Chorus]
I wanna, I wanna be loved
I wanna, I wanna be loved
I wanna, I wanna be loved
And I don't wanna run, I don't wanna hide

[Verse 2]
Traded out our eyes to light a screen
Traded out holdin' hands to holdin' back everything
No, no
No, no, oh
And words got shorter and quiet got longer
And all of a sudden, love started lookin' like a memory
No, no, no

[Pre-Chorus]
They started sayin', "If you can't hide, run"
"If you can't run, hide"
Started thinkin' love's a loaded gun
Nobody wants to fight
And when did we all start thinkin' that the world
Stop spinnin' in a kiss goodnight?
And when did our heartbeat beatin' too fast
Stop meanin' it was worth the while?

[Chorus]
I wanna, I wanna be loved
I wanna, I wanna be loved
I wanna, I wanna be loved
And I don't wanna run, I don't wanna hide, no

[Breakdown]
They started sayin', "When you can't hide, run"
"When you can't run, hide"
But love don't gotta be a loaded gun
Or a losin' fight
And when did we all start thinkin' that the world
Stop spinnin' in a kiss goodnight?
And when did our heartbeat beatin' too fast
Stop meanin' it was worth the while?

[Chorus]
But I wanna, I wanna be loved
I wanna, I wanna be loved
I wanna, I wanna be loved
And I don't wanna run, I don't wanna hide

[Outro]
And I don't wanna run, I don't wanna hide
And I don't wanna run, I don't wanna hide

[Verse 1]
Here I am again, the same old situation
Why does the guy thing have to be so complicated?
I shouldve played it cool, instead, I made a fool
Oh, the things I do

[Chorus]
'Cause Im young and Im dumb
I do stupid things when it comes to love
And even if I always end up crying
Well, you cant blame a girl for trying
Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh
No, you cant blame a girl for trying
Uh-uh-uh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh

[Verse 2]
I shouldve shut my mouth, I couldve kept it quiet
I might have freaked him out cause I was so excited
But I just couldnt wait, I took a leap of faith
Oh, the things I say

[Chorus]
'Cause Im young and Im dumb
I do stupid things when it comes to love
And even if I always end up crying
No, you cant blame a girl for trying
Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh
No, you cant blame a girl for trying
Oh-oh-oh-oh, no-oh-oh-oh, no

[Bridge]
And I think sometimes
I tend to be my own worst enemy
And maybe someday
Im gonna catch a shooting star falling out of the blue
Doing what I do

[Verse 3]
And just as Im giving up, my heart is palpitating
Here comes another one, it's so intoxicating
Being where Ive been I know that in the end
Ill do it all again

[Chorus]
'Cause Im young and Im dumb
I do stupid things when it comes to love
And even if I always end up crying
Well, love will find me, there ain't no denying
That you cant blame a girl for trying
Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh
No, you cant blame a girl for trying
Mmmm, uh-uh-uh-mmm-mmm

[Verse 1: Sabrina Carpenter]
Done everything and done it again
Not every party needs our attendance

[Pre-Chorus: Sabrina Carpenter]
Don't take this as complaining
Just little rearrangements
All the nights that we've been taking
Maybe we could take one off

[Chorus: Sabrina Carpenter]
Could be in the canyons, probably in a mansion
But I like where my hands is, I just wanna hold tight
Always gotta go out, we don't ever slow down
Not like we don't know how, I just wanna hold tight
Ah 
Always gotta go out, we don't ever slow down
Not like we don't know how, I just wanna hold tight

[Verse 2: Sabrina Carpenter]
Not like I wanna keep you inside, yeah
But I was hoping we could switch up how we're spending our time

[Pre-Chorus: Sabrina Carpenter]
Don't take this as complaining
Just little rearrangements
All the nights that we've been taking
Maybe we could take one off

[Chorus: Sabrina Carpenter]
Could be in the canyons, probably in a mansion
But I like where my hands is, I just wanna hold tight
Always gotta go out, we don't ever slow down
Not like we don't know how, I just wanna hold tight
Ah 
Always gotta go out, we don't ever slow down
Not like we don't know how, I just wanna hold tight

[Verse 3: UHMEER & Sabrina Carpenter]
I just want that hand hold, with the sweat in the middle
Running down to when I feel alone and the feeling gone you can touch it a little
Hear me underneath the covers, coloring your body, reading Braille
Take you to Bahamas, seeping through the sand
Sucking out the silence, now I'm in your ear
Telling you baby to listen, I just

Wanna keep you in, wanna keep you in, right
Wanna feel your skin, wanna feel it on mine
Maybe I been on the Internet forgetting how to keep it slow
But no I need it bitty bad bone Bonnie Clyde, come and get it
I don't know I get it, get it, I get it oh

[Chorus: Sabrina Carpenter]
Could be in the canyons, probably in a mansion
But I like where my hands is, I just wanna hold tight
Always gotta go out, we don't ever slow down
Not like we don't know how, I just wanna hold tight
Ah we keep going, keep going

Always gotta go out, we don't ever slow down
Not like we don't know how, I just wanna hold tight

[Verse 1]
You're not asking for much, but
It just seems like a lot, and
Kinda confused
Dont know what to choose
But baby, it's hard for me
I'm not ready for your love
I keep on the go, but
I dont mean to tease ya
You're down on your knees
You're beggin' me, "please"
But darling, it's not the way to get me baby, no

[Pre-Chorus]
Whoops, didnt mean to make you love me
Whoops, didnt mean to make you love me
Didn't mean to be charming
Such a beautiful darling
Didnt wanna make you think we can be a thing
And I give you everything, love

[Chorus]
Love feels like loneliness
Love feels like loneliness sometimes
That's just the way it is
Love feels like loneliness sometimes

[Verse 2]
We cant get the timing
Because I was running
But now I want you
And you always knew, so baby
You pull away and make me wait for you
So screw all that love -ish
I think that Ive had it
The more you turn your back, then I want you back
'Cause this is the last time I play this game
Always the same, and I'm through

[Pre-Chorus]
Whoops, didnt mean to make you love me
Whoops, didnt mean to make you love me
Didn't mean to be charming
Such a beautiful darling
Didnt wanna make you think we can be a thing
And I give you everything, love

[Chorus]
Love feels like loneliness
Love feels like loneliness sometimes
That's just the way it is
Love feels like loneliness sometimes

[Refrain]
Sometimes, sometimes
Sometimes, sometimes
Sometimes, sometimes
Sometimes, sometimes
Love feels like loneliness sometimes

[Breakdown]
Sometimes
'Cause love feels like loneliness sometimes

[Chorus]
Love feels like loneliness
Love feels like loneliness sometimes
That's just the way it is
Love feels like loneliness sometimes

[Refrain]
Sometimes, sometimes
Sometimes, sometimes
Sometimes, sometimes
Sometimes, sometimes
Love feels like loneliness sometimes

[Verse 1]
Think you got your break?
I'm no sugar mama, I'm no piggy bank
Tell me what you think, nah, nah, nah
Stacking bills and counting change
I'm no Rockefeller, I'm not what you think, no way, nah, nah, nah

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm your new money
Drop it all on your crew
Spent too soon, money
One percent I'm at the top of this earth money
That's what I'm worth, honey, that's what I'm worth, worth, worth

[Chorus]
I am a diamond, and diamonds are forever
My love is timeless, 'cause diamonds are forever, oh no, no

[Post-Chorus]
Money don't buy class, and I can't be bought like that, like that
I am a diamond, and diamonds are forever

[Verse 2]
Steal my heart, and steal my kiss
But you can't shake my balance, there's no can do no, nah, nah, nah
No can do no, nah, nah, nah
And I'll take you out, and I'll take you in
This love is my weakness, nah, nah

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm your new money 
Drop it all on your crew
Spent too soon, money
One percent I'm at the top of this earth money
That's what I'm worth, honey, that's what I'm worth, worth, worth

[Chorus]
I am a diamond , and diamonds are forever 
My love is timeless, 'cause diamonds are forever

[Post-Chorus]
Money don't buy class 
And I can't be bought like that, like that
I am a diamond, and diamonds are forever, oh nah, nah, nah

[Break]


Diamonds are forever, baby

What you gonna do for me, darling?

I guess you want me to
Give up these diamonds to you

[Chorus]
I am a diamond, and diamonds are forever
My love is timeless, 'cause diamonds are forever
They're forever, no, you know

[Post-Chorus]
Money don't buy class, and I can't be bought like that, like that
I am a diamond, and diamonds are forever

[Post-Chorus]

Diamonds, baby, diamonds, no, no

Know your love, these diamonds are yours


I guess you want me to
Give up these diamonds to you

[Verse 1]
We're picking fights, we're fully grown
How come we get so immature when we're alone?
I roll my eyes, you check your phone
You say I'm overly dramatic and I know

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause I wanna bring you to your knees
Begging for me now, begging for me
Push you to the edge to see
How far you're willing to reach

[Chorus]
I'm slamming the door, but I'm staying
I make up my mind and I change it
It's you that I want when we're breaking
Every time I tell you that we're done, I'm faking
I'm losing the game that I'm playing
Keep pulling me close 'cause I'm fading
Don't forget the words that I'm saying
Every time I tell you that we're done, I'm faking

[Post-Chorus]
 I'm faking
 I'm faking, oh
 I'm faking
Every time I tell you that we're done, I'm faking

[Verse 2]
We go ego to ego, starting fires
Saying shit we don't mean, I mean we're liars
But the truth is we're messed up and we like it
Shut up, shut up, shut up

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause I wanna bring you to your knees
Begging for me now, begging for me
Push you to the edge to see
How far you're willing to reach, yeah

[Chorus]
I'm slamming the door, but I'm staying
I make up my mind and I change it
It's you that I want when we're breaking
Every time I tell you that we're done, I'm faking
I'm losing the game that I'm playing
Keep pulling me close 'cause I'm fading
Don't forget the words that I'm saying
Every time I tell you that we're done, I'm faking

[Post-Chorus]
 I'm faking
 I'm faking, oh
 I'm faking
Every time I tell you that we're done, I'm faking

[Bridge]
I wanna bring you to your knees

Begging for me now 
I wanna see how far you're willing to reach, yeah


[Chorus]
I'm slamming the door, but I'm staying 
I make up my mind and I change it 
It's you that I want when we're breaking 
Every time I tell you that we're done, I'm faking
I'm losing the game that I'm playing 
Keep pulling me close 'cause I'm fading 
Don't forget the words that I'm saying
Every time I tell you that we're done, I'm faking

[Post-Chorus]
 I'm faking
 I'm faking, oh
 I'm faking
Every time I tell you that we're done, I'm faking

[Verse 1]
We all got nightmares in our dreams
We look for someone to believe in us and show us the way
And make it okay
The world can be dangerous
There's something so rare in your veins
Not a single thing I would change
And oh, if you only knew how I see you
Would you come alive again, alive again?

[Pre-Chorus]
I, I need you to understand

[Chorus]
I don't mind your shadows
'Cause they disappear in the light
I don't mind your shadows
'Cause they look a lot like mine
And listen to me, it's okay to be afraid
Just walk like you're never alone
I don't mind your shadows, your shadows
Baby, I don't

[Verse 2]
Pictures in our head of what we're supposed to be
Measuring ourselves, but where is the love?
Where is the love?
The world got us wonderin', wonderin'

[Pre-Chorus]
I, I need you to understand

[Chorus]
That I don't mind your shadows
'Cause they disappear in the light
And I don't mind your shadows
'Cause they look a lot like mine
And listen to me, it's okay to be afraid
Just walk like you're never alone
And I don't mind your shadows, your shadows
Baby, I don't

[Bridge]
And all these voices in our head
Well, they keep screamin' louder and louder
But they won't pull us under

[Chorus]
Baby, I don't mind your shadows
'Cause they disappear in the light
And I don't mind your shadows
'Cause they look a lot like mine
And listen to me, it's okay to be afraid
Just walk like you're never alone
And I don't mind your shadows, your shadows
Baby, I don't

[Intro]
I dare you to love me
The pretty and the ugly
If you're alone, I'll make it better
We could be alone together

[Verse 1]
Oh, I could really like it
Maybe we could carve it in the woods
Oh, Florence in the spring time
Love me in the meantime, wish you would

[Pre-Chorus]
But if we're all alone in a crowded room
Maybe we could be alone, just me and you
Baby, if you jump, then I'll jump too

[Chorus]
I dare you to love me
The pretty and the ugly
If you're alone, I'll make it better
We could be alone together

[Verse 2]
Oh, strangers in the nighttime
There's never a right time to say hello
Yeah, everyone's your best friend 'til you get to know them
But I know you

{Pre-Chorus]
And if we're all alone in a crowded room
Maybe we could be alone, just me and you
Baby, if you jump, then I'll jump too

[Chorus]
I dare you to love me
The pretty and the ugly
If you're alone, I'll make it better
We could be alone together

[Outro]
I dare you to love me
The pretty and the ugly
If you're alone, I'll make it better
We could be alone
We could be alone
We could be alone together

[Verse 1]
Everybody loves to tell me
I was born an old soul
Better keep my eyes wide open
There's so much that I don't know
Just another hotel room
Never felt so alone
I think about my granddad's eyes
And they always send me home
I can almost hear him now
I gotta make him proud

[Chorus]
I keep my eyes wide open
Bless this ground unbroken
I'm about to make my way
Heaven help me keep my faith
And my eyes wide open

[Verse 2]
I can't see two steps ahead of me
When the fog comes rollin' in
I never thought I'll miss the rain
Lord knows how long it's been
This dream burns inside of me
And I can't just let it go
There's still so much that I don't know

[Chorus]
I keep my eyes wide open
Bless this ground unbroken
I'm about to make my way
Heaven help me keep my faith
And my eyes wide open

[Bridge]
All I have is just this moment
I don't wanna miss a second
'Cause it could all be gone in an instant
Yeah, an instant

[Chorus]
I keep my eyes wide open
Bless this ground unbroken
I'm about to make my way
Heaven help me keep my faith
And my eyes wide open

[Outro]
I'm about to make my way
Heaven help me keep my faith
And my eyes wide open

Keep my eyes wide open

[Intro]
Ooh-ooh
Woah-oh
Woah-oh-oh-oh

[Verse 1]
If I smile, dancing alone for a while
Woah-oh, would you rescue me?
And if I fall, hoping it's in your arms
I know, know, know you'll rescue me

[Chorus]
Hoo-ooh, la-la-la-la-da-da
Woah-woah-woah, darling, please rescue me
Hoo-ooh, la-la-la-la-da-da
Woah-woah-woah, won't you please rescue me?

[Verse 2]
Give your heart
Baby, just ease your mind
To see that it's meant to be
'Cause when I'm with you, darling, it's such a breeze
That I know, know you'll rescue me

[Chorus]
Hoo-ooh, la-la-la-la-da-da
Woah-woah-woah, darling, please rescue me
Hoo-ooh, la-la-la-la-da-da
Woah-woah-woah, won't you please rescue me?

[Bridge]
And honey, if you see me drowning
Baby, fish me out, I'm falling
I just need a voice for calling
And can't you see I trust you always?
So I will linger 'til you know
That I will never let you go if you rescue me

[Verse 3]
If I smile, dancing alone for a while
Woah-oh, would you rescue me?
And if I fall, hoping it's in your arms
I know, know, know you'll rescue me

[Intro]
Aw shit

[Verse 1]
Got me in my feelings, mmm
What the hell you doing to me?
I can't help what I'm feeling
Yeah, 'cause I'm fallin' down like a summer rain

[Pre-Chorus]
People askin' what we doin', I don't say a thing
Can we keep it to ourselves like if it's all the same?
'Cause if they know what we know
That's when everything's gonna change

[Chorus]
Should we tell 'em? Mmm
It might be too much for them, they might get jealous, hey
The way that you're lifting me up, feel like heaven, oh
I know they can see it, I know they can tell it
So we ain't gotta tell 'em 

[Refrain]
We ain't gotta tell
Tell 'em nothing, no, tell 'em, tell 'em, no 
Tell 'em nothing, no, we tell 'em, tell 'em nothing 
We ain't gotta tell 'em, tell 


[Verse 2]
Ain't no reason why we need to tell nobody
We don't gotta give it any labels
Cards already on the table
And we don't need opinions in our head space
You and me already in a good place
Like whoa, stay, let's keep it this way

[Pre-Chorus]
People askin' what we doin', I don't say a thing, no
Can we keep it to ourselves like if it's all the same?
'Cause if they know what we know
That's when everything's gonna change

[Chorus]
Should we tell 'em? Mmm
It might be too much for them, they might get jealous, hey
The way that you're lifting me up, feel like heaven, oh
I know they can see it, I know they can tell it
So we ain't gotta tell 'em 

[Refrain]
We ain't gotta tell 'em
No, tell 'em, tell 'em, no 
Tell, tell 'em nothing, no, we tell 'em, tell 'em nothing 
We ain't gotta tell 'em, tell 


[Bridge]
You could be my dirty little secret
And you could be my everything I'm needing
And you could be my dirty little secret 
Nobody has to know 

[Refrain]
We ain't gotta tell 'em
No, babe, tell 'em, tell 'em, tell 'em, no 
Tell 'em nothing, no, we tell 'em, tell 'em nothing 
We ain't gotta tell 'em nothing, babe
We ain't gotta tell 'em, baby, no 
We ain't gotta tell nothin' to no one
We ain't gotta tell nothin' to no one
We ain't gotta tell
Tell 'em nothing, no, tell 'em, tell 'em, no 

You know, you know
Tell 'em nothing, no, we tell 'em, tell 'em nothing 

We ain't gotta tell 'em, tell 

[Outro]
Ain't got to tell, we ain't got to tell them nothing

Ain't got to tell, we ain't got to tell them nothing

Ain't got to tell, we ain't got to tell them nothing
Ain't got to tell, we ain't got to tell them nothing

Ain't got to tell, we ain't got to tell them nothing

Ain't got to tell, we ain't got to tell them nothing
Ain't got to tell, we ain't got to tell them nothing
Ain't got to tell, we ain't got to tell them nothing
Ain't got to tell 'em nothing, ain't got to tell
We ain't got to tell 'em nothing, ain't got to tell
We ain't got to tell 'em nothing, ain't got to tell
We ain't got to tell 'em nothing

[Verse 1]
Keep it casual, don't have to tippy toe
Take your cares off, just stay a couple more
You don't have to be, don't have to be a stranger
Go and get a little closer
Playing mind games, we don't do that here
So put your bid in before I disappear
You don't have to be, don't have to be a stranger
Come and get a little closer

[Pre-Chorus]
Ain't gotta hesitate
Ain't gotta make me wait
Oh, baby, won't you stay? Yeah

[Chorus]
Both of my eyes, they've been fixing on you
Wasting your time, should be making that move
Come and say, "Hi, I've been dying to meet ya"
Don't leave me hanging like the Mona Lisa
What's on my mind, I've been thinking maybe
I could be yours by the time that we leave
Come and say, "Hi, I've been dying to meet ya"
Don't leave me hanging like the Mona Lisa, oh

[Verse 2]
I know your type, what's with the timid behavior?
You let this ooh-la-la-la intimidate ya
Don't you make me, don't you make me leave on my own
I'm already ready, come on

[Pre-Chorus]
Ain't gotta hesitate
Ain't gotta make me wait
Oh, baby, won't you stay? Yeah

[Chorus]
Both of my eyes, they've been fixing on you
Wasting your time, should be making that move
Come and say, "Hi, I've been dying to meet ya"
Don't leave me hanging like the Mona Lisa
What's on my mind, I've been thinking maybe
I could be yours by the time that we leave
Come and say, "Hi, I've been dying to meet ya"
Don't leave me hanging like the Mona Lisa, oh

[Intro]
Bad time for a good time, baby
A bad time

[Verse 1]
You never finish your glass
Take a little sip and you're bored
Down in the apartment below
Wouldn't even open your door
You said, "It's a bad time for a good time, baby
A bad time" 
Too many times I've asked myself
"What did I come here for?"

[Pre Chorus]
Now I know you wanna talk about it, talk about it, yeah
Suddenly you're into me again
Let's talk about it, talk about it, yeah
I've been dying to use the line

[Chorus]
I'm sorry, but you've called at a bad time
And every time is probably gonna be a bad time
Sorry, but it's not like the last time
Where you were calling me and hoping for a good time
Bad time for a good time, baby
A bad time
You should know about it by now
Bad time for a good time, baby
A bad time
You should know about it by now
You should know about it 

[Verse 2]
Everything's so clear to me now
Wish I could have seen it before
You were sitting comfortable and
I was busy kissing your floor

[Pre Chorus]
Now I know you wanna talk about it, talk about it, yeah
Suddenly you're into me again
Let's talk about it, talk about it, yeah
I've been dying to use the line

[Chorus]
I'm sorry, but you've called at a bad time
And every time is probably gonna be a bad time
Sorry, but it's not like the last time
Where you were calling me and hoping for a good time
Bad time for a good time, baby
A bad time
You should know about it by now
Bad time for a good time, baby
A bad time
You should know about it by now 

[Post Chorus]
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la, yeah, sorry
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la, yeah, sorry

[Bridge]
Mmm, no
It's a really bad time 
You know that it's a bad time for a good time, baby
A bad time
I'm just gonna say it one more time for fun

[Chorus]
I'm sorry, but you've called at a bad time
And every time is probably gonna be a bad time 
Sorry, but it's not like the last time
Where you were calling me and hoping for a good time
Bad time for a good time, baby
A bad time
You should know about it by now 
Bad time for a good time, baby
A bad time
You should know about it by now

[Post Chorus]
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la, yeah, sorry

You should know about it by now

[Intro]
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Oh, oh

[Verse 1]
You can get real close, talking, you're talking now
Underneath our clothes, pretend that we know it all
Shut off the lights, just to hide in the dark
 dark,  dark
Think that I know you the farther you are


[Pre-Chorus]
Like A-B-C-D, that could work so perfectly
If perfect was the kinda thing that worked for me
But I wanna feel nervous, just a little bit off the edge

Even if I know that I will end up in a mess like

[Chorus]
Aye, aye, aye, aye, aye, it won't be perfect
But I know, oh, oh, oh, oh, it could be worth it
And for all of the nights I left tears running down my face, messing up my mascara
It's not perfect, aye, aye, aye, but maybe that's what we need


[Verse 2]
See right through the fiction, and all of this fakery

Just give me some friction, let me see what nobody sees

You don't think that I can handle the truth?

Baby, I'm over just playing it cool, oh

[Pre-Chorus]
Like A-B-C-D, that could work so perfectly
If perfect was the kinda thing that worked for me
But I wanna feel nervous, just a little bit off the edge

Even if I know that I will end up in a mess like

[Chorus]
Aye, aye, aye, aye, aye, it won't be perfect
But I know, oh, oh, oh, oh, it could be worth it
And for all of the nights I left tears running down my face, messing up my mascara
It's not perfect, aye, aye, aye, but maybe that's what we need

[Bridge]
That's what we need

That's what we need

Baby, do you think that you could give it to me?
That's what we need
That's what we need
Baby, do you think that you could give it to me?

[Chorus]
Aye, aye, aye, aye, aye, it won't be perfect
But I know, oh, oh, oh, oh, it could be worth it
And for all of the nights I left tears running down my face, messing up my mascara
It's not perfect, aye, aye, aye, but maybe that's what we need

Aye, aye, aye, aye, aye, it won't be perfect
But I know, oh, oh, oh, oh, it could be worth it
And for all of the nights I left tears running down my face, messing up my mascara
It's not perfect, aye, aye, aye, but maybe that's what we need

[Verse 1]
Hope I never see you in the right light 
Hope I always catch you at the wrong time 
If you let me take a picture of your bad side 
And you like it, well, that's a good sign, hey 
I know you're not a fan of double texting 
But you don't always gotta leave me guessing 
I know you wanna leave a good impression
But you did it, you did without tryin', oh yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
I like your soul when it's shirtless
'Cause it's just like mine
I like your hands when they're nervous
And they're all over mine, like yeah
Show me under the surface 
And we can cross that line 
When you stop acting perfect

[Chorus]
Baby, take off all your cool
Cool, cool
I'll take off mine too when you take off all your cool
Cool, cool
I'll take off mine too when you take it all off

[Verse 2]
We could even kick it in the driveway 
'Cause you know I'm not tryna over-complicate
If showin' all your colors led to heartbreak 
Then let it break on me, yeah, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
I like your soul when it's shirtless
'Cause it's just like mine
I like your hands when they're nervous
And they're all over mine, like yeah
Show me under the surface 
And we can cross that line 
When you stop acting perfect

[Chorus]
Baby, take off all your cool
Cool, cool
I'll take off mine too when you take off all your cool
Cool, cool
I'll take off mine too when you take it all off

[Bridge]
Don't play hard to get 
Be hard to forget 
Don't play hard to get, no 
Don't play hard to get 
Be hard to forget 
Don't play hard to get 


[Chorus]
Baby, take off all your cool
Cool, cool
I'll take off mine too when you take off all your cool
Cool, cool
I'll take off mine too when you take it all off


[Outro]

When you take it all off 
When you take it all off 
Baby, I'll take off mine too
When you take off all your cool 
When you take it all off 
When you take it all off 
Baby, I'll take off mine too

[Intro]
No words, no words, no words

[Verse 1]
When everything is quiet
Nothing on the tip of your tongue
But a beautiful silence
And it lets me know
That even in the madness
When everything just seems to go wrong
Take a beautiful silence
'Cause it lets me know

[Pre-Chorus]
Ribs are a cage of a wild heart
I can hear your heart beatin' in the bars
Beatin' in the bars, beatin' in the bars
Ribs are a cage of a wild heart
I can hear your heart beatin' in the bars
Beatin' in the bars, beatin' in the bars

[Chorus]
When everything is up and down
Up and down, up and down
And the world is tryin' to beat you down
Beat you down, beat you down
No, no, no words
We could keep it quiet
Leave it on the tip of your tongue
When everything is up and down
Up and down, up and down
No, no, no words

[Verse 2]
When I'm in the darkness
The dawn is having you by my side
'Cause you leave me speechless
And it lets me know
Where nobody can hear us
I'll tell you everything with my eyes
'Cause you leave me speechless
And I think you know

[Chorus]
When everything is up and down
Up and down, up and down
And the world is tryin' to beat you down
Beat you down, beat you down
No, no, no words
We could keep it quiet
Leave it on the tip of your tongue
When everything is up and down
Up and down, up and down
No, no, no words

[Bridge]
No words, no words, no words
We need
No words, no words, no words
Hear me
No words, no words, no words
Baby
No words, no words, no words
No words, no

[Instrumental Interlude]
No, no, no
No words
No, no

[Chorus]
When everything is up and down
Up and down, up and down
And the world is tryin' to beat you down
Beat you down, beat you down
No, no, no words
We could keep it quiet
Leave it on the tip of your tongue 
When everything is up and down
Up and down, up and down
No, no, no words

[Bridge]
No words, no words, no words
We need
No words, no words, no words
Hear me
No words, no words, no words
Baby
No words, no words, no words

[Pre-Chorus]

Ribs are a cage of a wild heart
I can hear your heart beatin' in the bars

Beatin' in the bars, beatin' in the bars
No, no, no words

Ribs are a cage of a wild heart 
I can hear your heart beatin' in the bars

Beatin' in the bars, beatin' in the bars
No, no, no words

[Outro]
Baby, no words, no words, no words

[Verse 1]
I picked you out 'cause you were shiny and new
Had all the features, even came with tattoos

[Pre-Chorus]
But I just figured out now what hindsight means
Up until now, never had any reason to
Wish that I didn't, but now I do
The hell do I do with all these receipts?
Every moment that I ever spent on you
Shoulda just bought a new pair of shoes

[Chorus]

I wanna take you back, take you back, oh

I wanna put you back, put you back where I found you

I wanna take you back, take you back, I

I wanna put you back, put you back where I found you

[Post-Chorus]

I wanna put you back, na-na


[Verse 2]
Closest I've ever come to buyer's remorse
If you don't make me happy, then what good are you for?

[Pre-Chorus]
But I just figured out now what hindsight means
Up until now, never had any reason to
Wish that I didn't, but now I do
The hell do I do with all these receipts?
Every moment that I ever spent on you
Shoulda just bought a new pair of shoes

[Chorus]

I wanna take you back, take you back, oh

I wanna put you back, put you back where I found you


I wanna take you back, take you back, I


I wanna put you back, put you back where I found you

[Bridge]

If it ain't broke, don't fix it
If it is broke, then go get rid of it, rid of it

If it ain't broke, don't fix it
If it is broke, then go get rid of it, say it again 

If it ain't broke, don't fix it
If it is broke, then go get rid of it, rid of it

If it ain't broke, don't fix it
If it is broke, then go get rid of it, say it again

[Chorus]

I wanna take you back, take you back, oh 

I wanna put you back, put you back where I found you


I wanna take you back, take you back, I

I wanna put you back, put you back where I found you

[Outro]

I wanna put you back where I found you
Back to where you came from

No, no, no, no, no


I wanna take you back, oh no

[Intro]
I hope we stay the same, hey
Honeymoon

[Verse 1]
Unexpected, this thing that we fell into
Like, so connected
Youcameatatimewhen my heartwas selective
Didn't haveto choose, my lovewas accepted, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
Now I'm learning you like 101
You were sent to me like a one of one
And now we're going hard, just one on one
Nobody else

[Chorus]

I hope that we can love through the pain
After the honeymoon fades

I hope we stay the same
I hope we can love through the pain
After the honeymoon fades

[Post-Chorus]
After the honeymoon fades, yeah

[Verse 2]
Now remember when we met, we was all in each other's bed
And we were spending every second we had
And now that it's official, it's hittin' a little different
What the hell we gonna do with these bags? No, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
And now I'm learning you like 101
You were sent to me like a one of one
And now we're going hard, just one on one
Nobody else

[Chorus]
I hope we never change
I hope we stay the same
I hope that we can love through the pain
After the honeymoon fades
I hope we never change
I hope we stay the same
I hope we can love through the pain
After the honeymoon fades 

[Post-Chorus]

After the honeymoon fades




[Bridge]
And I hope it tastes the same, mmm
Even if it's bittersweet

Honeymoon fading with you 
Honeymoon fading, fading

[Verse 1]
They could tear this house down brick by brick
But we won't even miss a thing
They said we'd never make it, but our hearts won't quit
A never ending fantasy

[Pre-Chorus]
We could be royalty, king and queen of nowhere
Lose it all, everything
As long as we got you and I, you and me
They can tear this whole house down

[Chorus]
All we have is love
All we have is love
All we have is love 

[Refrain]
When shadows and demons are chasin'
There's no way that our hearts will be breakin'
'Cause all we have is love 

[Verse 2]
We don't need a dream to be wide awake
When everyday is ecstasy
We won't let the stars-crossed change our fate
It's heaven when you're next to me 

[Pre-Chorus]
We could be royalty, king and queen of nowhere
Lose it all, everything
As long as we got you and I, you and me
They can tear this whole house down

[Chorus]
All we have is love
All we have is love
All we have is love 

[Refrain]
When shadows and demons are chasin'
There's no way that our hearts will be breakin'
'Cause all we have is love 

[Interlude]
They could tear this house down brick by brick
But we won't even miss a thing
They said we'd never make it, but our hearts won't quit
A never ending fantasy

[Chorus]
All we have is love
All we have is love
All we have is love 

[Refrain]
When shadows and demons are chasin'
There's no way that our hearts will be breakin'
'Cause all we have is love

[Outro]
'Cause all we have is love
'Cause all we have is love 

[Verse 1]
They said, "You can't wear Giamba
Baby, you gotta pay"
Well then, we got a problem, problem
"And there's a party at midnight at the top of the hill
But you gotta be someone, someone"

[Pre-Chorus]
And every face is a hologram
We're all caught in a dream
We're all caught in a dream
And everyone plays so innocent
It's all part of the scene, oh

[Chorus]
Is it just a mirage?
All these Hollywood gods
And everything that we've got
Is it just a mirage?

[Verse 2]
And we just go through the motions
Yeah, we lock 'em inside
Don't show any emotion, emotion
And everybody's been talking
Believe it or not
But you don't gotta listen, listen

[Pre-Chorus]
And every face is a hologram 
We're all caught in a dream
We're all caught in a dream
And everyone plays so innocent 
It's all part of the scene, oh

[Chorus]
Is it just a mirage?
All these Hollywood gods
And everything that we've got
Is it just a mirage?

[Refrain]
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

[Bridge]
Is it real, is it real or not?
Is it real, everything we've got?
I don't know 
And is it real, is it real or not?
Is it real, everything we've got? Ooh

[Chorus]
Or is it just a mirage?
All these Hollywood gods
And everything that we've got
Is it just a mirage?

[Refrain]
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

[Outro]
Is it just a mirage?[Refrain]
Oh, oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

[Verse 1]
Cast out to sea
Drifting with the tide
And no way of finding me
Now that I'm free
Nothing but blue skies
Paradise in front of me

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Awake from this dream
I hold my breath and just believe

[Chorus]
Tired of all the troubles, they've been wasting my time
I don't wanna fight, gonna leave it behind
Take it on faith, now I'm ready to fly
I'm in the middle of starting over
Back to the beginning, gonna hit rewind
Chance to do it over, get it right this time
Life gives you pennies, turn them into dimes
I'm in the middle of starting over
I'm in the middle of starting over

[Refrain]
Oh, oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

[Verse 2]
Alone in a room
Tearing down the walls
Painting over scars and bruises
Now this is home
Fill it up with love
And make the best of something new, yeah

[Pre-Chorus 2]
As hard as it seems
I hold my breath and just believe

[Chorus]
Tired of all the troubles, they've been wasting my time
I don't wanna fight, gonna leave it behind
Take it on faith, now I'm ready to fly
I'm in the middle of starting over
Back to the beginning, gonna hit rewind
Chance to do it over, get it right this time
Life gives you pennies, turn them into dimes
I'm in the middle of starting over

[Bridge]
The colors in the stars seem a little brighter
Tomorrow isn't far away
Through the hardest part
I'm working towards a happy ending

[Chorus]
Tired of all the troubles, they've been wasting my time
I don't wanna fight, gonna leave it behind
Take it on faith, now I'm ready to fly
I'm in the middle of starting over
Back to the beginning, gonna hit rewind
Chance to do it over, get it right this time
Life gives you pennies, turn them into dimes
I'm in the middle of starting over

Tired of all the troubles, they've been wasting my time
I don't wanna fight, gonna leave it behind
Take it on faith, now I'm ready to fly
I'm in the middle of starting over
Back to the beginning, gonna hit rewind
Chance to do it over, get it right this time
Life gives you pennies, turn them into dimes
I'm in the middle of starting over
I'm in the middle of starting over

[Refrain]
Oh, oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

[Verse 1]
We are young, we are gold
Trying things we didn't know
Looking at the sky
See it come alive
All our fears became our hopes
Climbed out every locked window
We rode a lion's mane
And fell upon the rain

[Pre-Chorus 1]
We can reach the constellations
Trust me, all our dreams are breaking out

[Chorus]
No, we're never gonna turn to dust
Yeah, all we really need is us
Don't be scared to close your eyes
No, we're never gonna die
We'll be the stars, oh
No, we're never gonna step too far
Yeah, we're holding on to who we are
When it's time to close your eyes
They will see us in the sky
We'll be the stars

[Post-Chorus]
Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh
We'll be the stars
Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh
We'll be the stars

[Verse 2]
Let me in
Hold me close
Fill my heart with simple notes
So when it's hard to see
They are there reminding me
Take my breath
And hold me high
So I can feel the city lights
Glowing under me
It's in our reach

[Pre-Chorus 2]
We're breaking out

[Chorus]
No, we're never gonna turn to dust
Yeah, all we really need is us
Don't be scared to close your eyes
No, we're never gonna die
We'll be the stars, oh
No, we're never gonna step too far
Yeah, we're holding on to who we are
When it's time to close your eyes
They will see us in the sky
We'll be the stars

[Post-Chorus]
Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh
We'll be the stars
Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh
We'll be the stars

[Bridge]
We can reach the constellations
Trust me, all our dreams are breaking out

[Chorus]
No, we're never gonna turn to dust
All we really need is us
We'll be the stars, oh
No, we're never gonna step too far
Yeah, we're holding on to who we are
When it's time to close your eyes
They will see us in the sky
We'll be the stars

[Outro]
Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh
We'll be the stars
Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh
We'll be the stars
Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh
We'll be the stars
Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh
Woah, we'll be the stars

[Verse 1]
You are the voice inside my mind
Something so real is hard to find
I know, I know 
I know, I know 
I'll hold you tight, remove the air
No space between, I want you here
I know, I know 
Baby, you're home

[Pre-Chorus]
Headfirst, I dive
Won't wait for time
We're livin' for tonight...

[Chorus]
You give me a reason to feel what I feel
When everything is under attack
You got my heart, I don't want it back
You might be the answer to all of my fears
When everything is under attack
You got my heart, I don't want it back

You got my heart, I don't want it back

[Verse 2]
This moment can't be washed away
A part of you's a part of me
I know, I know 
I know, I know 
This love we have will never end
We're circles, we begin again
I know, I know
Baby, I'm home

[Pre-Chorus]
Headfirst, I dive
Won't wait for time, no
We're livin' for tonight

[Chorus]
You give me a reason  to feel what I feel 
When everything is under attack
You got my heart, I don't want it back
You might be the answer to all of my fears 
When everything is under attack
You got my heart, I don't want it back

You got my heart, I don't want it back

[Bridge]
You give me a reason 
You give me a feeling 
But all of the things you've given to me
You've given to me, baby...

[Outro]
You give me a reason to  feel what I feel
When everything is under attack 
You got my heart, I don't want it back
You might be the answer  to all of my fears 
When everything is under attack
You got my heart, I don't want it back

Don't want it back, no, baby
You got my heart, I don't want it back


You got my heart, I don't want it back

[Verse 1]
Under pressure 
Questions all around, but there's no answers 
Try to keep my pace, they want it faster 
Records all around, they give me shelter, shelter 

[Pre-Chorus]
No need to hurry, no need to rush
I tell them my story, it's never enough!


[Chorus]
I'm hiding from my shadows
Running inside my dreams
I know that you are watching
You're right there watching me
I need a taste of freedom
I need some room to breathe
But I know that you are watching
You're right there watching me

[Refrain]
So gimme a little, gimme a little,  a little more space
Just gimme a little, gimme a little 

[Verse 2]
Satisfaction 
All we ever want, but I can't have it 
Scribbles on the page, they call it magic 
Makes me wanna be what you imagine, imagine, ah

[Pre-Chorus]
No need to hurry 
No need to rush 
I tell them my story, it's never enough!


[Chorus]
I'm hiding from my shadows
Running inside my dreams
I know that you are watching
You're right there watching me
I need a taste of freedom
I need some room to breathe
But I know that you are watching
You're right there watching me

[Post-Chorus]

Gimme, gimme, gimme space

Gimme, gimme, gimme... space

Gimme, gimme, gimme space

Gimme, gimme, gimme... space
Space!

[Chorus]
I'm hiding from my shadows
Running inside my dreams
I know that you are watching
You're right there watching me
I need a taste of freedom
I need some room to breathe

But I know that you are watching
You're right there watching me


[Post-Chorus]

I'm hiding from my shadows

Keep it low, don't make a sound



When the eyes are all around


Keep it low don't make a sound



[Outro]
(Just gimme a little, gimme a little,  a little more space)
(Just gimme a little, gimme a little,  a little more space)
Just give me some space

Just give me some space


Just give me some space, baby

[Verse 1]
I'm played out, it's late out
I'm really hoping you don't care
This pent up momentum
You're starting to become aware

[Pre-Chorus]
I had the upper hand
But I don't, I don't
I know, I know, I don't
I had the upper hand
But I don't, I don't
I know, I know, I don't

[Chorus]
We can't get too romantic
Too busy running high and low
I just don't understand it
Why I lie, why I lie for love
We can't get too romantic
Too busy running high and low
I just don't understand it
Why I lie, why I lie for love

[Verse 2]
It's all there, it's not fair
Where will our hearts be when it's done?
When night falls, and you don't call
I'll stay up waiting for the sun

[Pre-Chorus]
I had the upper hand
But I don't, I don't
I know, I know, I don't
I had the upper hand
But I don't, I don't
I know, I know, I don't

[Chorus]
We can't get too romantic
Too busy running high and low
I just don't understand it
Why I lie, why I lie for love
We can't get too romantic
Too busy running high and low
I just don't understand it
Why I lie, why I lie for love

[Bridge]
I had the upper hand
But I, I, I
I had the upper hand
But I
O-oh

[Chorus]
We can't get too romantic
Too busy running high and low
I just don't understand it
Why I lie, why I lie for love
We can't get too romantic
Too busy running high and low
I just don't understand it
Why I lie, why I lie for love

[Verse 1]
Big lights
People rushing to grow up, before you know
Stop signs
Denied
Everyone tells me I gotta go slow

[Pre-Chorus]
And it's gonna hurt sometimes
No matter what you do
But nothing can change my mind

[Chorus]
If I'm too young to fall in love
Why do you keep runnin' through my brain?
If I'm too young to know anything
Then why do I know that I'm just not the same?
Don't tell me I won't
Don't tell me I can't feel
What I'm feeling is real
'Cause I'm not too young

[Verse 2]
Rain drops
Deep thoughts
Pictures of you and me wherever I go
Laughing
Running to a place where nobody says "no"

[Pre-Chorus]
And it's gonna hurt sometimes
No matter what you do
But I've got to fall to fly, yeah

[Chorus]
If I'm too young to fall in love
Why do you keep runnin' through my brain?
If I'm too young to know anything
Then why do I know that I'm just not the same?
Don't tell me I won't
Don't tell me I can't feel
What I'm feeling is real
'Cause I'm not too young

[Interlude]
'Cause I'm not too young, oh
Yeah, yeah, yeah

[Chorus]
And if I'm too young to fall in love
Why do you keep runnin' through my brain?
And if I'm too young to know anything
Then why do I know that I'm just not the same?
Don't tell me I won't
Don't tell me I can't feel
What I'm feeling is real
'Cause I'm not too young
'Cause I'm not too young, no
'Cause I'm not too young

[Verse 1]
Good morning, you're leaving
I'll see you in the evening
My best friend 'til the end
My better half, no pretend
Our language is sacred
Though people try to solve it
New adventures on the way

[Chorus]
You and me together
Take on the world forever
I know all your secrets
And I promise you, I'm gonna keep them
I'll be there when you are feeling clueless
You and me, oh yeah, we're seamless
Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh, yeah
Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

[Verse 2]
We're klutzy, but so lucky
That I always have you to catch me
We're partners in crime
You're stuck with me your whole life
So different
Out of our minds
From a planet that's hard to find
Every second every day

[Chorus]
You and me together
Take on the world forever
I know all your secrets
And I promise you, I'm gonna keep them
I'll be there when you are feeling clueless
You and me, oh yeah, we're seamless

[Bridge]
You're right by my side whenever I need you
Through the hardest times, I'll be there for you
At the crack of dawn when the moon is gone
I won't be hard to find
'Cause you and me, oh yeah, we're seamless
Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh, hey
Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh yeah

[Chorus]
You and me together
Take on the world forever
I know all your secrets
And I promise you, I'm gonna keep them
I'll be there when you are feeling clueless
You and me, oh yeah, we're seamless
Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh, hey
Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

[Intro]
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh

[Verse 1]
Sometimes life gets bitter
I get strung out
Caught in the middle
And I can't breathe
I just need a little taste of paradise

[Pre-Chorus]
I know a place I can escape to
Where I go
Troubles never break through
The grass is greener
My head is clearer
I got peace of mind when I fall into your eyes

[Chorus]
Your love's like breathing in the salty air
Of summer on a private island just for me
Your love's like the feeling I get
When my favorite song's spinning in my head
Keep it play
Playing on repeat
It's like flowers in the spring time
Every day is Valentine's
So good
It's hard to describe
It's like Paris after midnight
Dancing in the moonlight
That's what your love
That's what your love's like

[Post-Chorus]

That's what your love
That's what your love's like 
That's what your love
That's what your love's like

[Verse 2]
Stop signs
I keep on running into
Red lights
Make me wanna scream like
Why can't it just be
Only you and me all the time
In a world no one can find

[Chorus]
Your love's like breathing in the salty air
Of summer on a private island just for me
Your love's like the feeling I get
When my favorite song's spinning in my head
Keep it play
Playing on repeat
It's like flowers in the spring time
Every day is Valentine's
So good
It's hard to describe
It's like Paris after midnight
Dancing in the moonlight
That's what your love
That's what your love's like

[Post-Chorus]

That's what your love
That's what your love's like 
That's what your love
That's what your love's like

[Bridge]
When life has left me numb
And I need a pick me up
There's no better rush than your love
Your love
Your love

[Chorus]
Your love's like breathing in the salty air
Of summer on a private island just for me
Your love's like the feeling I get
When my favorite song's spinning in my head
Keep it play
Playing on repeat
It's like walking on the ceiling
Can't compare the feeling
Better than I could ever describe
It's like soaking in the sunrise
Not a worry on my mind
That's what your love
That's what your love's like

[Post-Chorus]

That's what your love
That's what your love's like 
That's what your love
That's what your love's like 
That's what your love
That's what your love's like 
That's what your love's like

[Intro]
I don't know my name
I don't play by the rules of the game
So you say I'm just trying, just trying

[Verse 1]
So I heard you are my sister's friend
You get along quite nicely
You ask me why I cut my hair
And changed myself completely

[Chorus]
I don't know my name
I don't play by the rules of the game
So you say I'm just trying, just trying

[Verse 2]
I went from bland and popular
To joining the marching band
I made the closest friends
I'll ever have in my lifetime

[Bridge]
I am lost, trying to get found
In an ocean of people
Please don't ask me any questions
There won't be a valid answer
I'll just say that

[Chorus]
I don't know my name
I don't play by the rules of the game
So you say I'm just trying, just trying

[Outro]
I now know my name
I don't play by the rules of the game
So you say, I'm not trying
But I'm trying, to find my way

[Verse 1]
She always has a smile
From morning to the night
The perfect poster child
That was once in my life

[Pre-Chorus]
A doll made out of glass
All her friends think that she's great
But I can see through it all
And she's about to break

[Chorus 1]
Remember last year when you told me
To always stay here and never leave me
The light from your eyes made it feel like
We-e-e-e were dancing in the moonlight
Remember last year when you told me
That these will be lifelong stories
The light from your eyes made it feel like
We-e-e-e were dancing in the moonlight

[Post-Chorus]
You-ou-ou-ou were dancing in the moonlight
And I, I, I, I was dancing in the moonlight

[Verse 2]
Now she lost her way
And she forgets to smile
Never gets a break
From this life in denial

[Pre-Chorus]
A doll made out of glass
All her friends think that she's great
But I can see through it all
And she's about to break, oh!

[Chorus 1]
Remember last year when you told me
To always stay here and never leave me
The light from your eyes made it feel like
We-e-e-e were dancing in the moonlight
Remember last year when you told me
That these will be lifelong stories
The light from your eyes made it feel like
We-e-e-e were dancing in the moonlight

[Post-Chorus]
You-ou-ou-ou were dancing in the moonlight
And I, I, I, I was dancing in the moonlight

[Bridge]
I, I, I, miss those me-mo-ries
We used to share, just you and me

[Chorus 2]
I remember last year when I told you
I would always stay here and never leave you
I told you the light in your eyes made it look like
We-e-e-e were dancing in the moonlight
Remember last year when you told me
To always stay here and never leave me 
The light from your eyes made it feel like
We-e-e-e were dancing in the moonlight

[Outro]
The light from your eyes made it feel like
Dancing In the moonlight

[Verse 1]
You think that you know my heart
And you probably do
That's why I'm always with you
I could stay with you for hours
In an empty room
Never get bored
Never have nothing to do

[Pre-Chorus]
You're my other half
You're what makes me, me
What makes me smile
When I fall down and can't get back, get back, get back up
On my feet
Without you here I am boring
Something inside you is triggering
It makes me myself
Makes me funny

[Chorus]
You're a beautiful thing
We're a beautiful thing together
Even when the weather is low
You're a beautiful thing
We're a beautiful thing together
Even when the weather is low
We can find the rainbow
Up in the sky
You'd say don't you cry, it's all gonna be alright

[Verse 2]
If we ever got into a fight or war that would be bad
Cause you know all of my secrets
But I know all of yours
We make hours into seconds together
The weight of the world feel like a feather
Cause we're holding it right in our hands

[Pre-Chorus]
You're my other half
What makes me, me
What makes me smile
When I fall down and can't get back, get back, get back up on my feet
Without you here I am boring
Something inside you is triggering
It makes me myself
Makes me funny

[Chorus]
You're a beautiful thing
We're a beautiful thing together
Even when the weather is low
You're a beautiful thing
We're a beautiful thing together
Even when the weather is low

[Bridge]
You and me together
We'll forget what we have been told
We'll live in our own dream world
You and me forever
We'll forget what we have been told
We will take on the whole world

[Pre-Chorus]
Without you here I am boring
Something inside you is triggering
It makes me myself
Makes me funny

[Chorus]
You're a beautiful thing
We're a beautiful thing together
Even when the weather is low
And that's a beautiful thing

[Verse 1]
Sit right here, chill, level low
Close your eyes and just let it flow
Right next to me I hear your heart beat, beat
When the dial turns up and the music starts playing
We don't realize in this society
Doesn't matter how your hair looks, or what they are thinking
Just, just what we are finding, oh

[Pre-Chorus]
Tap your foot and listen in
Ignore the world, let the music cave in
Close your phone and breathe in the air
You'll soon realize that there's something that is

[Chorus]
So much more than this
It is what it is
So much more than this
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh 
So much more than this
It is what it is
So much more than this
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

[Verse 2]
The whole crowd seems to like me now
'Cause I think I'm cool but back when I was in school
They found it very easy to hate me
Funny how always these times are changing
Back then it was so easy to shatter
But now in the end it doesn't really matter

[Pre-Chorus]
Tap your foot and listen in
Ignore the world, let the music cave in
Close your phone and breathe in the air
You'll soon realize that there's something that is

[Chorus]
So much more than this
It is what it is
So much more than this
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh 
So much more than this
It is what it is
So much more than this
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

[Bridge]
All of the talk and the talk from ya
Won't even matter when the lights come up
All of the talk and the talk from ya, hey
Open your eyes and just wake up
Do all the things that will matter to ya
Open your eyes and just wake up, woah

[Pre-Chorus]
Tap your foot and listen in
Ignore the world, let the music cave in
Close your phone and breathe in the air
You'll soon realize that there's something that is

[Chorus]
So much more than this
It is what it is
So much more than this

You'll soon realize that there's something that is
So much more than this
It is what it is
So much more than this
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

[Outro]
So much more than this
It is what it is
So much more than this
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

[Verse 1]
There's a world outside my door
I don't know it anymore
I'm gonna stay here now
I'm gonna stay here now
Close the curtains, cut the lights
Match the darkness in my mind
It's gonna take me down
It's gonna take me down

[Pre-Chorus]
All the roads I've been before
Same mistakes always got me shakin'
And all the signs I once ignored
In my denial, I didn't want to face them

[Chorus]
I can see clearly now
The rain has gone
I accept all the things that I cannot change
Gone are the dark clouds
The dawn has come
It's gonna be a bright, bright sunshiny day

[Verse 2]
There's a world outside my door
I forced my feet down to the floor
I'm gonna make it out
I'm gonna make it out
Take a breath and say a prayer
Find the strength in my despair
It's not gonna take me down
It's not gonna take me down

[Pre-Chorus]
All the roads I've been before
Same mistakes always got me shakin'
And all the signs I once ignored
In my denial, I didn't want to face them

[Chorus]
I can see clearly now
The rain has gone
I accept all the things that I cannot change
Gone are the dark clouds
The dawn has come
It's gonna be a bright, bright sunshiny day
It's gonna be a bright, bright sunshiny day

[Bridge]
All the pain in my sorrow
Won't change today, only ruin tomorrow
All the pain in my sorrow
Won't change today, only ruin tomorrow

[Chorus]
I can see clearly now
The rain has gone
I accept all the things that I cannot change
Gone are the dark clouds
The dawn has come
It's gonna be a bright, bright sunshiny day
It's gonna be a bright, bright sunshiny day

[Verse 1]
You see a girl in the hallway
And you whisper to your friend, "Who is she anyway?"
You forgot what she looks like in like a day
But your words don't hurt me
I will be okay

[Bridge]
'Cause you don't hurt me
I won't mold to...

[Chorus]
Your silly words
I won't live inside your world
Because your punches and your names
All your jokes and stupid games
They don't work
No they don't hurt
Watch them just go right through me
Because they mean nothing to me
I'm not Clay

[Verse 2]
You see that girl in the hallway
Smile on her face as she walks away
Trying to tear her down was your first mistake
'Cause little do you know she wasn't built to break

[Bridge]
'Cause you don't hurt me
I won't mold to...

[Chorus]
Your silly words
I won't live inside your world
Because your punches and your names
All your jokes and stupid games
They don't work
No they don't hurt
Watch them just go right through me
Because they mean nothing to me

[Bridge]
Try to change my shape
But, baby, I'm not Clay
Sorry not today
Because, baby, I'm not...
Try to change my shape
But, baby, I'm not Clay
Sorry not today
Because, baby, I'm not Clay

[Chorus]
Your silly words
I won't live inside your world
Because your punches and your names
All your jokes and stupid games
They don't work
No they don't hurt
Watch them just go right through me
Because they mean nothing to me
I'm not Clay

[Verse 1]
Lower East Side and it's pourin' out
Don't you look right at me now
Is it you or are the lights
Gettin' brighter in the night?
Let's get coffee at a vibey spot
We can sit around, I talk a lot
But you're so chill, you keep it cool
I am not, I'm such a fool

[Chorus]
Damn, you're so beautiful
And don't you know it?
Don't you? Don't you?
Don't you? Don't you?
Damn, you're so beautiful
And don't you know it?
Don't you? Don't you?
I think you do

[Verse 2]
Walkin' along but not sayin' a thing
Let's sit down and think of what we could be
If you wanted to say something
You would say it, promise me
Walkin' lightly to my surprise
Fallin' over the fear of looking in your eyes
But now I am questioning
I caught you lookin' at me

[Chorus]
Damn, you're so beautiful
And don't you know it?
Don't you? Don't you?
Don't you? Don't you?
Damn, you're so beautiful
And don't you know it?
Don't you? Don't you?
I think you do 

[Bridge]
And who do you think you are?
Who do you think you are?
Messin' with my eyes
Make me overthink my lines
I think I'm fallin' blind
Who do you think you are?
Who do you think you are?
Not looking back to say goodbye
Is it all in my mind?
I think it's all in my mind

[Chorus]
Damn, you're so beautiful
And don't you know it?
Don't you? Don't you?
Don't you? Don't you?
Damn, you're so beautiful
And don't you know it?
Don't you? Don't you?
I think you do
Damn, you're so beautiful
And don't you know it?
Don't you? Don't you?
I think you do 


I know you do 


I think you do

[Verse 1]
Here we go again in the same story
Follow the routine until we say "I'm sorry"
Hands are shaking till I just look down at the floor
Face is turning red and eyes are going puffy
You ask me why we yell and I come up with nothing
Your insecurities are pulling you back
But please know, oh, oh

[Chorus]
I love you, but I don't like you
The simple truth is I can't do this, though I try to
I love you, but I don't like you
And I can't shut you out, so I'm shutting my mouth
But I'll never despise you
I just don't like you
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

[Verse 2]
We pour our souls out about the past months
By just trying to talk about lunch
And every single thing we say is gonna start a new war
And I'm exhausted from this tug of war of words
And when you said "I don't care for you" it got worse
We both know it isn't working but I still put you first

[Chorus]
'Cause I love you, but I don't like you
The simple truth is I can't do this, though I try to
I love you, but I don't like you
And I can't shut you out, so I'm shutting my mouth
But I'll never despise you
I just don't like you

[Bridge]
Ooh
We both refuse to lose
We both refuse to choose the higher road
Which way we go, oh-oh, oh-oh
And ooh 
We both refuse to lose 
We both refuse to choose the higher road
Which way we go, oh-oh, oh-oh

[Chorus]
'Cause I love you, but I don't like you
The simple truth is I can't do this, though I try to
I love you, but I don't like you
And I can't shut you out, so I'm shutting my mouth
But I'll never despise you
I just don't like you
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

Oh, oh, oh, oh


Oh, oh

Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
I just don't like you

[Verse 1]
It was wrong, we'll have never worked
Or at least I tell myself
To not make it hurt
I try to blast music
In attempt to get you out of my eyes
But I can't escape my mind

[Pre-Chorus]
I hate you 'cause I've always
Look at your picture
And I tell myself that I'm over you
But then I get a little unsure

[Chorus]
I wish I could get you out of my mind
But I think about it all the time
And I wish I could not think for once in my life
But when I see your face, I can't escape my mind

[Verse 2]
I know we were never a thing
But I always think about
What could've happened if we kept going
And I never had this happen to me
Only in the movies
But honey, it is happening

[Pre-Chorus]
I hate you 'cause I've always
Look at your picture
And I tell myself that I'm over you
But then I get a little unsure

[Chorus]
I wish I could get you out of my mind
But I think about it all the time
And I wish I could not think for once in my life
But when I see your face, I can't escape my mind

[Bridge]
I can't escape my mind
I wish I could turn it off sometimes 
I can't escape my mind, oh
No matter how hard I try
I wish I could turn it off sometimes

[Chorus]
I wish I could get you out of my mind
But I think about it all the time
And I wish I could not think for once in my life
But when I see your face, I can't escape my mind

[Verse 1]
You tell me that I'm crazy
Doin' this alone
You don't need to save me
Oh, how I have grown

[Pre-Chorus]
I am capable of everything you can see
But now I want to change

[Chorus 1]
Just blow out the candles
Oh, little boy, when will you learn?
You don't play with fire
Unless you wanna get burned, wanna get burned
Just blow out the candles
Oh, how the tables, they've turned
You don't play with fire
Unless you wanna get burned, you wanna get burned


[Verse 2]
Something's just so crazy
Things you'll never know
There is always that word, "Maybe"
That keeps stringing you along

[Pre-Chorus]
Hmm, 'cause I am capable of everything you can see
But now I want to change

[Chorus 1]
Just blow out the candles
Oh, little boy, when will you learn?
You don't play with fire
Unless you wanna get burned, wanna get burned
Blow out the candles
Oh, how the tables, they've turned
You don't play with fire
Unless you wanna get burned, wanna get burned

[Bridge]
What is that, that I see
Floating right in front of me?
Lock the door, try to leave
But now it's clear to me

[Chorus 2]
You didn't blow out the candles
Oh, little boy, you never learn
You don't play with fire
But you're already burned, you're already burned
Blow out the candles
Oh, little boy, you've never learned
You don't play with fire
But you're already burned, you're already burned

[Outro]
Wanna get burned, wanna, wanna get burned
Wanna get burned, wanna, wanna get burned
Wanna get burned, wanna, wanna get burned


[Verse 1]
Opening my eyes
Seems like it gets harder sometimes
Look at the skylight
Would you be mad at me if I tried running away to it in the night?
I tried to fight
But I'm not strong enough
I just want you here
But I also want to be alone
I don't know what I want anymore

[Chorus]
Every now and then
The darkness tries to chase me
And my legs are getting tired of running
Oh, please don't
Please don't let it get to me
Oh, I don't wanna give up that easily
But the darkness keeps chasing me, me

[Verse 2]
Hiding places remind me of you and I
I wanna call you
But if I hear your voice
I just might cry
And I don't even know what the song's about, anymore
And I don't know what I want, anymore

[Chorus]
Every now and then
The darkness tries to chase me
And my legs are getting tired of running
Oh, please don't
Please don't let it get to me
Oh, I don't wanna give up that easily
But the darkness keeps chasing

[Bridge]
Weather streams down my cheeks
I look to my right
See you're blowing smoke in your ripped jeans
Don't tell me you fell in
The darkness is already seeping through
Oh, can't you see?
I will be different
I'm not sure if I can do it all alone
God, I want to be different
But I'm not sure if I can do it on my own

[Chorus]
'Cause every now and then
The darkness tries to chase me
And my legs are getting tired of running
No, no, no, no, please don't
Please don't let it get to me
Oh, I don't wanna give up that easily
But the darkness keeps chasing me
Me, me, me

[Verse 1]
I don't wanna be difficult
At all
But let's just try it my way
I mean, c'mon

[Pre-Chorus]
I've showed you countless numbers of times that
I can do it 
So for one time in your whole life just
Let me try it 

[Chorus]
I'm sick of being to-o-o-o-old
Of what I should kno-o-o-o-ow
I just wanna let go-o-o-o-o
I wanna run away just to live my life my way
Hey, wo-o-o-o-oh
Sick of being to-o-o-o-old
Wo-o-o-o-oh
Sick of being to-o-o-o-old

[Verse 2]
What's the harm
To have a little fun?
Been so uptight
I don't mean to fight
I'm just, stay and watch

[Pre-Chorus]
I've showed you countless numbers of times that
I can do it 
So for just once in your whole life just
Let me try it 

[Chorus]
I'm sick of being to-o-o-o-old
Of what I should kno-o-o-o-ow
I just wanna go-o-o-o-o
I wanna run away just to live my life my way
Hey, wo-o-o-o-oh
Sick of being to-o-o-o-old
Wo-o-o-o-oh
Sick of being to-o-o-o-old

[Bridge]
I see stars, you just see holes in the sky
You tell me you see it too, but I know that's a lie
I dream up into the night, just see the darkness of your eyes
I won't let you change me tonight

[Chorus]
I'm sick of being to-o-o-o-old
Of what I should kno-o-o-o-ow
I just wanna let go-o-o-o-o
I wanna run away so I can live my life my way
Hey, wo-o-o-o-oh
Sick of being to-o-o-o-old
Wo-o-o-o-oh
Sick of being to-o-o-o-old

[Outro]
Wo-o-o-o-oh
Sick of being to-o-o-o-old
Wo-o-o-o-oh
Sick of being to-o-o-o-old

[Verse 1]
Fresh laid concrete
Melodies blowing
Don't care where we're going
But the day is wasting
Just keep moving
And take it all in!

[Pre-Chorus]
The rumble of voices
Are the bass to our song
The horns are just on the beat
Honkin' along
Let's be the harmony
But no note is wrong

[Chorus]
And let's take the city
And make it our song
Our song
Our song
Let's take the city
And make it our song

[Verse 2]
Pencil tapping
Feet speed walking
Cars just driving
Daydream gazing
Just keep moving
And take it all in

[Pre-Chorus]
The rumble of voices
Are the bass to our song
The horns are just on the beat
Honkin' along
Let's be the harmony
But no note is wrong

[Chorus]
And let's take the city
And make it our song
Our song
Our song
Let's take the city
And make it our song

[Bridge]
Everything going on around you
Just close your eyes
And disconnect for a moment or two
And hear

[Pre-Chorus]
The rumble of voices
Are the bass to our song
The horns are just on the beat
Honkin' along
We'll be the harmony
But no note is wrong

[Chorus]
And let's take the city
And make it our song
Our song
Our song
Let's take the city
And make it our song

[Verse 1]
Let's wrap a blanket 'round us
And go flyin' into outer space
We could be famous, speak a different language
Make our great escape

[Pre-Chorus]
I'll chase the stars inside your eyes
And follow you into the great unknown
We'll be alone

[Chorus]
So let's just play pretend and find a secret place
When the world around us says that we should act our age
The day is gonna come when there's no time left to waste
But we'll never grow up, I say we hide away

[Verse 2]
And build a city, something out of nothing
Make this place a home, a home
Stay make-believing, we'll go disappearing
Who would ever know?

[Pre-Chorus]
We'll never be too far apart
'Cause in the end, you and I both know
There's somewhere we can go

[Chorus]
So let's just play pretend and find a secret place
When the world around us says that we should act our age
The day is gonna come when there's no time left to waste
But we'll never grow up, I say we hide away

[Bridge]
Just want to hide away
Hide away, hide away
Hide away, hide away
We'll never grow up
Just want to hide away
Hide away, hide away
Hide away, hide away

[Chorus]
So let's just play pretend and find a secret place
When the world around us says that we should act our age
The day is gonna come when there's no time left to waste
But we'll never grow up, I say we hide away
So let's just play pretend and find a secret place
When the world around us says that we should act our age
The day is gonna come when there's no time left to waste
But we'll never grow up, I say we hide away
Don't make me grow up, I say we hide away

[Intro]
Wherever the wind blows, ever the wind blows
Don't let go

[Verse 1]
I wanna wake up in a dream, dream, dream
Where the air is softer to breathe, breathe, breathe

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Hold on and don't let go
If we fall down, then you should know
That we could just be

[Chorus]
Blowing florets, I wanna dance in the air
Blowing florets, and just not care
About anyone or anything but you and me
So don't let go of me
Don't let go of me, eeh

[Verse 2]
I wanna rise up with the trees, trees, trees
And let go of our responsibi-li-ties

[Pre-Chorus 2]
And we could just be

[Chorus]
Blowing florets, I wanna dance in the air
Blowing florets, and just not care
About anyone or anything but you and me
So don't let go of me
Don't let go of me, eeh

[Bridge]
Wherever the wind blows, ever the wind blows
Don't let go
Wherever the wind blows, ever the wind blows
Don't let go

[Chorus]
Blowing florets, I wanna dance in the air
Blowing florets, and just not care
About anyone or anything but you and me
Don't let go of me-e, oh
Don't let go of me-e-e-e-ooh
Don't let go of me

[Outro]
Wherever the wind blows, ever the wind blows 
Don't let go
Wherever the wind blows, ever the wind blows
Don't let go-o

[Verse 1]
Runnin' with you it's like we're in a memory
That I'll try to forget when you grow up and leave
Walkin' slow because the time's been running far
Maybe I should grow up, leave you with a scar

[Pre-Chorus]
You say "I love you" with an accent 
Then I pretend like nothin' happened 
Tell me, won't you miss Manhattan?
And even though this is pointless
And even though this is hopeless

[Chorus]
I just wanna waste my time
And I just wanna waste your time
We can do anything you like
We can talk all night 

[Verse 2]
I'm unsure of you because I know you'll leave
You say you love me but I whisper "I don't believe"
Stoppin' moments 'cause I can't let it be true
This is going nowhere but I love wasting my time with you

[Pre-Chorus]
You say "I love you" with an accent 
Then I pretend like nothing happened 
Tell me, won't you miss Manhattan?
And even though this is pointless
And even though this is hopeless

[Chorus]
I just wanna waste my time
And I just wanna waste your time
We can do anything you like
We can talk all night 
Just waste my time
Waste your time

[Pre-Chorus]
You say "I love you" with an accent
And then I look away and act like nothing happened
Tell me honestly, will you miss seeing Manhattan?
And even though this is pointless
And even though this is hopeless

[Chorus]
I just wanna waste my time
And I just wanna waste your time
We can do anything you like
We can talk all night
I'll pretend you're mine
Just waste my time

[Outro]
Waste my time

Waste your time

Waste, waste, my time

Waste your time
[Verse 1]
You're lookin' at me
I'm lookin' at you
Is this ever gonna sort itself out?
I don't know what it will do

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause you're talkin' 'bout a marriage
And our life together
No honey, I'm not lookin' for anything like
What you're searchin' for, oh

[Chorus]
You're just
Just
Just
You are, you are
Just a crush

[Verse 2]
I hope you understand
What I'm telling you
I don't wanna be confusing
Consider me one of the dudes
And yes, it'd be nice
To hold hands once in a while
But you're over here
Planning like wild

[Pre-Chorus]
Yes, you're talkin' 'bout a marriage
And our life together
No honey, I'm not lookin' for anything like
What you're searchin' for, oh

[Chorus]
You're just
Just
Oh, just
You are, you are

[Bridge]
I'm sorry, I don't wanna see you
It'd be worse if I faked you out all of these years
I'm sorry, I don't want no tears
So let me just say it now, perfectly clear

[Chorus]
You're just
Just
Just
You are, you are

[Chorus]
Just
Just
Oh, Just
You are, you are
Just a crush[Whispering Intro]

[Verse 1]
Hugs and kisses
Best friends forever, you tell me
Pinky swears and bracelets
Always telling secrets at slumber parties

[Pre-Chorus]
Not trying to point any fingers
But I've heard the whispers
Going around
Not trying to point you out here
Just making the facts clear
That I have found

[Chorus]
That you're the gossip girl
I thought you were real to me
The gossip girl
But you're just plastic, girl
Shiny plastic hard shell
Don't give in to gossip, girl

[Verse 2]
We were closer than sisters
I was the miss to your mister
You were the light to my fixture
I was the frame to your picture [x2]

[Chorus]
But you're the gossip girl
I thought you were real to me
The gossip girl
But you're just plastic, girl
Shiny plastic hard shell
Don't give in to gossip, girl
I thought you were real to me
The gossip girl
But you're just plastic, girl
Shiny plastic hard shell
Don't give in to

[Bridge]
Gossip girls, they always seem to
Talk the talk about you
Gossip girls, they always seem to
Talk the talk but never say the truth

[Chorus]
That you're the gossip girl
I thought you were real to me
The gossip girl
But you're just plastic, girl
Shiny plastic hard shell
Don't give in to gossip, girl
I thought you were real to me
The gossip girl
But you're just plastic, girl
Shiny plastic hard shell
Don't give in to gossip, girl
Gossip girl

[Whispering Outro]

[Verse 1]
I wanna write a song
One that can explain my lungs
I wanna write a song
That you can hear and
Know how my heart yearns
And how my insides churn
And how my cheeks burn
From the weekly storm
And how my face turns
Before you return to the wall
And then down the floor

[Chorus]
I keep only seeing rain
I will say no
But you keep crawling in my brain
I wanna get lost, run away
In the dark is where I'll stray

[Verse 2]
I gotta write a song
But I wanna feel my words
And I keep getting it all wrong
Think it out, write it out, rip it out
Start all over, ooh

[Chorus]
And I keep only seeing rain
I will say no
But you keep crawling in my brain
I wanna get lost, run away
In the dark is where I'll...

[Bridge]
I wanna feel the way I used to
I wanna move the way I used to groove
I wanna feel the way I used to
I wanna move the way I used to groove

[Chorus]
But I keep only seeing rain
I keep saying no
But you find your way into my brain
I wanna get lost, run away
In the dark is where I
I keep only seeing rain
I will say no
But you keep crawling in my brain
I wanna get lost, run away
In the dark is where I'll stray

[Outro]
I wanna feel the way I used to
I wanna move the way I used to groove
I wanna feel the way I used to
I wanna feel the way I used to

[Verse 1]
Stars, they got nothing on us
I don't think you understand
Let's go out and do something we'd never do
Cause I feel like I can do anything when

[Pre-Chorus]
My head is spinning and my feet off the ground
And I can't stop dancing like no one's around
And yeah, I think we were born to shine

[Chorus]
Cause the stars are dull when they're compared to you and I
And if people don't like it then they can close their eyes
Cause we're not the same and we don't have to try
Cause we're brighter than fireflies
We're gonna light the sky
Oo wa oo oh oh
Oo wa oo oh oh oh
Oo wa oo oh oh
Oo wa oo oh oh oh
Light the sky

[Verse 2]
You and me, we stand out of the crowd
Cause we are not afraid to let our light out
So trust me and just have no doubts
Cause we will be tearing through the clouds

[Pre-Chorus]
Cause my head is spinning and my feet off the ground
And I can't stop dancing like no one's around
And yeah, I think we were born to shine

[Chorus]
Cause the stars are dull when they're compared to you and I
And if people don't like it then they can close their eyes
Cause we're not the same and we don't have to try
Cause we're brighter than fireflies
We're gonna light the sky
Oo wa oo ah oh
Oo wa oo ah ah oh
Oo wa oo ah oh
Oo wa oo ah ah oh
Light the sky

[Bridge]
You and me
Me and you
We will shine through
You and me
Me and you
We will shine

[Pre-Chorus]
Cause my head is spinning and my feet off the ground
And I can't stop dancing like no one's around
And yeah, I think we were born to shine

[Chorus]
Cause the stars are dull when they're compared to you and I
And if people don't like it then they can close their eyes
Cause we're not the same and we don't have to try
Cause we're brighter than fireflies
We're gonna light the sky
Oo wa oo ah oh
Oo wa oo ah ah oh
Oo wa oo ah oh
Oo wa oo ah ah oh
Light the sky

[Verse 1]
It sounded so much better in my mind, mind
I guess I messed it up again this time, time, time
There's something else that I wanted to say, say
But my twisted tongue got in the way, way, way

[Pre-Chorus]
Ooh, my mouth is moving without thinkin'
Ooh, my brain and mouth on different systems
Why can't you see my side of things?
I've been thinkin' 'bout it ever since

[Chorus 1]
I wish I said this, I wish I said that
But I kinda froze in my tracks
I wish I said this, I wish I said that
But I kinda had a panic attack
I wish I could talk good
I wish I could talk, I wish I could talk
I wish I could talk good

[Verse 2]
Rerun the conversation in my head, head
Think of all the things that I should've said instead

[Pre-Chorus]
Ooh, my mouth is moving without thinkin'
Ooh, my brain and mouth on different systems
Why can't you see my side of things?
I've been thinkin' 'bout it ever since

[Chorus 1]
I wish I said this, I wish I said that
But I kinda froze in my tracks
I wish I said this, I wish I said that
But I kinda had a panic attack
I wish I could talk good
I wish I could talk, I wish I could talk
I wish I could talk good
I wish I could talk good
I wish I could talk, I wish I could talk
I wish I could talk good

[Bridge]
My words, my mind
Are worth all your time
My words, my mind
Are worth all your time
I don't wanna be a puppet getting caught on your line
I come back to these words every time

[Chorus 2]
I wish I said this, I wish I said that
But I kinda had a panic attack
I wish I said this, I wish I said that
But I kinda froze in my tracks
I wish it went the way it went in my head
But it kinda crashed and burned instead
Why does it always end up like this and I
So badly wish I could talk good 
I wish I could talk, I wish I could talk
I wish I could talk good
I wish I could talk good 
I wish I could talk, I wish I could talk
I wish I could talk good

[Verse 1]
Your eyes
They speak to me
But I dont know what they are saying
But I think I know what you are thinking

[Chorus]
So close your eyes
And create yourself a better life
Let the wind blow through your hair
Let the music take you there
And make a better life
A better life

[Verse 2]
You found a lighter
On the street
And suddenly everything just
Seems so happy
My honey it's all temporary

[Chorus]
Just close your eyes
And create yourself a better life
Let the wind blow through you hair
Let the music take you there
And make a better life
A better life

[Chorus]
So close your eyes
And create yourself a better life
Let the wind blow through you hair
Let the music take you there
And make a better life

[Outro]
A better life
Maybe this time
Things will turn out right

[Verse 1]
Tap your foot and watch the clock
I tried to look excited when you walked inside
The doo-oor, but it was all for sho-ow
I need to get it all out of my mind
Just blast some music and close my eyes
Hmm o-oh, got me singing like woah-oh

[Pre-Chorus]
Turn it up and I sing it loud
And just shut the world out
See the colors, feel it in my bones
It goes, ho-o-oh

[Chorus]
Spin the record, darling, inside of my mind
And let's just go, go, go and lose track of time
Here we go, on this crazy ride
Here we go, in this crazy life, o-oh
'Cause, 'cause don't you know-ow?
We're all a little insane sometimes

[Verse 2]
Louder and louder with every thought
Shaking the floors until the pictures fall off
The walls, the walls

[Pre-Chorus]
So we'll turn it up and I sing it loud
And just shut the world out
See the colors, feel it in my bones
It goes, ho-o

[Chorus]
Spin the record, darling, inside of my mind
And let's just go, go, go and lose track of time
Here we go, on this crazy ride
Here we go, in this crazy life, o-oh
'Cause, 'cause don't you know-ow?
We're all a little insane sometimes

[Bridge]
Don't you know-ow? Hoo, hoo, hoo
We're all a little insane sometimes

[Chorus]
Spin the record, darling, inside of my mind 
And let's just go, go, go and lose track of time
Here we go, on this crazy ride
Here we go, in this crazy life, o-oh 
'Cause, 'cause don't you know-ow? 
We're all a little insane sometimes, ho, ho-o
We're all a little insane sometimes

[Verse 1]
We were hanging with your rich kid city friends
Ones that I don't know
Not sure whattosay, say itanyway
It isn't how I thought it'dgo

[Pre-Chorus]
And even if I'm faking it
Pretending to be confident
I'm pathetic, I'll admit
Asking

[Chorus]
Would you call me a poser?
Or would you call me a friend?
After all that I told you
Was this time well spent?
I don't know what this meant

[Verse 2]
Did you take me here just to show me off
To that girl you used to know?
Everybody here is looking at me weird
So I just put on a show

[Pre-Chorus]
And even if I'm faking it
Pretending to be confident
I'm pathetic, I'll admit
For asking

[Chorus]
Would you call me a poser?
Or would you call me a friend?
After all that I told you
Was this time well spent?
I don't, I don't, I don't

[Bridge]
And who am I kidding
If I can't convince myself?
And who are you kidding
If I was there for someone else?
On the train home
I'll stare at my phone
To hide my thoughts of what I might know

[Chorus]
Would I call you a poser?
Are we more than just friends?
After all that I told you
Was this time well spent?
I don't know what this meant
What this meant
Da-da-da-da-da...
Don't know what this meant

[Outro]
I wish I could fall into your love
But love is so overrated
I wish I could fall into your love
I really hope I don't mess you up
And you don't mess me up
And I don't mess you up
I hope I don't mess you up

[Verse 1]
Don't say maybe, just don't wake me
We can stay here, for as long as wewant
Andmake forever lasta while
Leave the light on
After thesun
Leaves and goes to a far off ocean
And lay herewithme

[Chorus]
AndI'll catch you
Fallin'into me, fallin'into you
Lettin' go of all the things I thought were true
Fallin' into me as I'm fallin' into you
It seems so clear but I don't know what to do, ooh-ooh, ooh

[Verse 2]
I speak too much
You stay closed off
But I can see your thoughts in the stardust
Shining back at me

[Chorus]
As I catch you
Fallin' into me, fallin' into you
Lettin' go of all the things I thought were true
Fallin' into me, as I'm fallin' into you
It seems so clear but I don't know what to do, ooh-ooh, ooh

[Post-Chorus]
Ooh, ooh,ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh, ooh,ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh
Ah-ah-ah, hmm-hmm
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah

[Bridge]
One day I'll be old and ugly
Will you still be thinking of me?
If we were as brave as we are now

[Chorus]
And I'll catch you
Thinking of me, as I'm thinking of you
Lettin' go of all the things I thought were true
As you're fallin' into me and I'm fallin' into you
It seems so clear but I don't know what to do, ooh-ooh, ooh

[Outro]
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh
Hey-hey, hey-hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
Hmm-hmm-hmm-hmm

[Verse 1]
Dancing flames into this glass castle
And underground wax world
Rushing water at the park
Takes you to a different world

[Chorus]
And the air was filling my lungs
Autumn was filling your lungs
We're just trying to be young
But little do we know that trying to be young
Is what is making us grow old
The air was filling my lungs
Autumn was filling your lungs
We're just trying to stay young
But little do we know that trying to stay young
Is what is making us grow old

[Post-Chorus]
That's what
That's what is making us grow old

[Verse 2]
A puddle of rain puddling on my window
Makes me smile and feel refreshed
But then I'm walking down the street
In the middle of the night
Singing these lyrics to me
Kind of starts messing with my head

[Chorus]
And the air was filling my lungs
Autumn was filling your lungs
We're just trying to be young
But little do we know that trying to be young
Is what is making us grow old
Air was filling my lungs
Autumn was filling your lungs
We're just trying to stay young
But little do we know that trying to stay young
Is what is making us grow

[Bridge]
Listen to the breath of my voice
And just close your eyes and go oh-oh-oh
Let's just live life as we are
'Cause we only have limited ti-i-ime

[Chorus]
And the air was filling my lungs
Autumn was filling your lungs
We're just trying to be young
But little do we know that trying to be young
Is what is making us grow old

[Outro]
I just wanna let go
Ooh, ooh

[Verse 1]
Go through the day
But I'll be checking on my phone
To see if you called
You didn't call
One of the boys
I'll be chill, I'll keep my cool
But don't play me for the fool
Don't be so cruel
'Cause I can fake it that I'm happy
But this time you can see
You try to make a good memory
'Cause you like my jealousy
But you're

[Pre-Chorus]
Out in the city
When you should be here with me
I know I might be boring
But I'm not one for pity
Have a ball
At the Whitney with your friends
All so pretty
I know I'm being dramatic
So I'll go and wish you

[Chorus]
Have fun in the city, oh, oh, oh
Have fun in the city, oh, oh, oh


[Verse 2]
Time passes slow
And I've called everyone I know
But the more that people come over
I realize I'm getting worse than I was alone
Close down my phone
I've been on it so much my eyes hurt
And the outside is getting darker
I'm tired and it's getting harder and harder to
Fake it that I'm truly happy 
And all my friends can see 
You try to make a good memory 
But that's hard when it's not with me
'Cause you're

[Pre-Chorus]
Out in the city
When you should be here with me
I know I might be boring
But I'm not one for pity
So have a ball
At the Whitney with your friends
All so pretty
I know I'm being dramatic
So I'll go and wish you

[Chorus]
Have fun in the city, oh, oh, oh
Have fun in the city, oh, oh, oh
Have fun in the city, oh, oh, oh
Have fun in the city, oh, oh, oh

[Outro]
Have fun
Go and have fun
Have fun
Oh, oh, oh
Have fun
Have fun
Have fun

[Verse 1]
I tried to wake up today
Kept making withdrawals
But now we've got to pay

[Pre-Chorus]
When will we realize
We shouldn't touch the fire
'Cause now it seems
We've been pushed to walk the wire

[Chorus]
This is just the same old classic stupid day
You never think through what you're gonna do or say
We don't worry 'bout tomorrow
Should we worry 'bout tomorrow?
We just hope for some kind of change
Just hope for some change

[Verse 2]
See it, read it, hear it
Questions go around so quickly
But I guess that's old news
The same old thing

[Pre-Chorus]
When will we realize
We shouldn't touch the fire
'Cause now it seems
We've been pushed to walk the wire

[Chorus]
Hey, this is just the same old classic stupid day
You never think through what you're gonna do or say
We don't worry 'bout tomorrow
Should we worry 'bout tomorrow?
We just hope for some kind of change
Just hope for some change

[Bridge]
Just hope for some, just hope for some
Just hope for some, just hope for some

[Pre-Chorus]
When will we realize

We shouldn't touch the fire
'Cause now it seems

We've been pushed to walk the wire

[Chorus]
This is just the same old classic stupid day
You never think through what you're gonna do or say
We don't worry 'bout tomorrow
Should we worry 'bout tomorrow?
We just hope for some kind of change
This is just the same old classic stupid day
You never think through what you're gonna do or say
We don't worry 'bout tomorrow
We don't worry 'bout tomorrow
We just hope for some kind of change
Just hope for some, just hope for some
Change

[Verse 1]
Hey, there's something I think you should know, ooh
Something that's really important to me
You know we used to hang out whether it was sun, rain, or snow, ooh
Talking to you used to be a breeze

[Chorus]
Can someone please tell me where to find you?
Cuz sometimes I miss that smile from your face
And some people say that it's part of getting older, but
I don't think that's true
I still miss you

[Verse 2]
Hey, so I guess you just thought you'd let it be
Thought everything was overrated
But please, may I just ask why you think they are better than me
I guess that [?] just has kinda faded

[Chorus]
So tell me, will I ever see you again?
Cuz sometimes I miss hanging around your face
And some people say that it's all for the better, but
I don't think that's true
I still miss you, ooh yea
You

[Outro]
Hey, there's something I think you should know, ooh
Something that's really important to me

[Verse 1]
When some loud braggart tries to put me down
And says his school is great
I tellhimright away
"Now what'sthe matter buddy
Ain't you heard ofmy school
It's number one in the state"

[Chorus]
So be true toyourschoolnow
Just like youwould to yourgirl or guy
Be true to your school now
And let your colors fly
Be true to your school

[Verse 2]
I got a letterman's sweater
With a letter in front
I got for football and track
I'm proud to wear it now
When I cruise around
The other parts of the town
I got a decal in back

[Chorus]
So be true to your school now
Just like you would to your girl or guy
Be true to your school now
Let your colors fly
Be true to your school

[Verse 3]
On Friday we'll be jacked up on the football game
And I'll be ready to fight
We're gonna smash 'em now
My girl will be working on her pom-poms now
And she'll be yelling tonight

[Chorus]
So be true to your school now
Just like you would to your girl or guy
Be true to your school now
Let your colors fly
Be true to your school

[Verse 1]
I just bought some new Gucci shoes
Wasted my college funds just to look cute
Forty minutestolook like Idid it in two
Maybe I amvain, so are you

[Refrain]
Hey
And I want it for free
Yeah, I wish that I was free
I wonder if anybody sees what I see
And na-na-na-na-lee

[Bridge]
Why do I care? Why do I? Well, I don't know
Why do I care? Why do I care? Why do I?
Why do I care? Why do I? Well, I don't know
Why do I care? Why do I care? Why do I?
Why do I care? Why do I? Well, I don't know
Why do I care? Why do I care? Why do I?
Why do I care? Why do I? Well, I don't know

[Verse 2]
So I got a new whip, got some new clothes
Then made some new friends that I don't even know
And I got a new whip, got some new clothes
I learned a new dance, got a new nose

[Outro]
And I don't even care, I don't even care
No, I don't even
I don't even care, I don't even
No, no, no, no
And I don't even care
And I don't even care
And I don't even
I don't even

[verse 1]
They drifted away
But she wanted to stay
Even though she knows his feelings will never change
She waits and she waits
Just to hear her name
And those three words that mean everything

[pre-Chorus]
But deep down she's aware that
That's something that'll never reach her ear
And deep down she's aware that
That's something she'll never live to hear

[Chorus]
So go ahead and kill me as long as he's safe
And go ahead and shoot me as long as I can see his face
When I'm gone

[verse 2]
She sees his face everyday
And maybe one day he'll say :
"I've always felt that way."

[pre-Chorus]
But deep down she's aware that
That's something she'll never live to hear
And deep down she's aware that
Those words will never reach her ear

[Chorus]
So go ahead and kill me as long as he's safe
And go ahead and shoot me as long as I can see his face
When I'm gone, when I'm gone

[bridge]
Forget about you over the weekend
Decide that I'm over it
But the second I see your face again
It's like the match was re-lit [x2]

[Chorus]
So go ahead and kill me as long as he's safe
And go ahead and shoot me as long as I can see his face
When I'm gone

[Intro]
Ooh-wee-ooh-wee-ooh-wee...

[Verse 1]
I don't mind you taking up my feelings and thoughts
You know how to speak English properly
But not like you play golf
I look at you and tell you that I'm feeling you out
Are you scared or just getting bored of me now?

[Pre-Chorus]
And everybody says that there's such thing as second chances
But in life you just take what you get
When I look at you it feels like it will be forever
But who knows when we'll meet again

[Chorus]
I'll make you laugh, I'll make you feel a special way
With only me, with only me
You'll want to spend your everyday
Ooh, I'll give my all, all of my energy
But no matter what, no matter what
You'll just get bored of me

[Interlude]
Ooh-wee-ooh-wee-ooh-wee...

[Verse 2]
I'm mad, because you speak so easily to everyone
Please stop putting yourself down constantly
And just hear me for once

[Pre-Chorus]
Stop listening to your mama when she gets in your head
Turn off your voice and just talk
You listen to my words but the moment I stop I say more
But your eyes, will they just unlock?

[Chorus]
I'll make you laugh, I'll make you feel a special way
With only me, with only me
You'll want to spend your everyday
Ooh, I'll give my all, all of my energy
But no matter what, no matter what
You'll just get bored of me

[Bridge]
I give my heart, I give my soul
I get attached and then they go, oh
I play my part, I play the role
Maybe I should hide away so that they never know

[Chorus]
I'll make you laugh, I'll make you feel a special way
With only me, with only me
You'll want to spend your everyday
Ooh, I'll give my all, all of my energy
But no matter what, no matter what
You'll just get bored of me

[Outro]
Ooh-wee-ooh-wee-ooh-wee...

[Verse 1]
Been travellin' these wide roads
So long
My heart's been far from you
Ten thousand miles gone

[Refrain]
Oh, I wanna come to and give you
Every part of me
But there's blood on my hands
And my lips are unclean

[Verse 2]
In my darkness I remember
Momma's words reoccur to me
"Surrender to the good Lord
And wipe your slate clean"

[Chorus]
Take me to your river
I wanna go
Oh, take me to your river
I wanna go

[Verse 3]
Dip me in your smooth water
Or go in
From a man with many crimes, come up for air
As my sins flow down the Jordan

[Refrain]
Oh, I wanna come to and give you
Every part of me
But there's blood on my hands
And my lips are unclean

[Chorus]
Take me to your river
I wanna go
Oh, take me to your river
I wanna go

Wanna go, wanna go, wanna go
Wanna know, wanna know, wanna know
Wanna go, wanna go, wanna go
Wanna know, wanna know, wanna know, hoo

[Outro]
Go, take me to your river

Would you be an outlaw for my love?
If it' s so then let me know
If it's no then I can go
And I won't make you

[verse 1]
You think that you know everything you need to know about the world
But let me tell you now, you're just a little girl
There's much more to come
You can't give up now
College exams and high school boyfriends
Just getting by for the rest

[pre-Chorus]
So we'll take it one step at a time
Don't be nervous you'll be fine
We'll get through this together
You and me
So we'll take it one step at a time
Don't be nervous you'll be just fine

You and me

[Chorus]
Cause i believe you can

[Verse 1]
I've been told if you let good God in
You'll be shown what your entire pathlookslike written
I lookback on just last year andwho I was
I'm so different
Things have changed me
Responsibilities, hurt and pain
Yeah, if you hear me, I'm praying that my path is written

[Chorus]
And I keep trying to write happy songs
I'm screaming to the sky
Wanna hear your song
I'm losing grip on my feet
But I can't fall
I don't know who'll catch me
So I keep trying to write happy songs
The big men have told me I got it all wrong
Like, what about parties?
Something that will move all of their feet
But you don't even know
No, you don't even know
No, you don't even know
You don't even know me
And I don't even know
No, I don't even know
No, I don't even know
I don't even know me

[Verse 2]
The priest speaks and tells me
Walk the grass, hear the song, listen

[Chorus]
So, I listen and try to write a happy song
But I'm screaming to the sky
I must hear this wrong
I'm losing grip on my feet
But I can't fall
I don't know who'll catch me
So I keep trying to write happy songs
The big men have told me I got it all wrong
Like, what about parties?
Something that will move all of their...

All you gotta do is listenDon't touch my hair
When it's the feelings I wear
Don't touch my soul 
When it's the rhythm I know
Don't touch my crown
They say the vision I've found
Don't touch what's there
When it's the feeling I wear

They don't understand
What it means to me
Where it chose to go
Where it been to know
They don't understand
What it means to me
Where it chose to go
Where it been to know

You know this hair is my shit
Rolled the rod, I gave it time
But this here is mine
You know this hair is my shit
Rolled the rod, I gave it time
But this here is mine

What you say to me?
What you say to me?
What you say to me?
What you say to me?
What you say to me?
What you say to me?
What you say to me?
What you say to me?

What you say to me?
What you say to me?
What you say to me?
What you say, What you say
What you say 
What you say to me?
What you say to me?

I tried to drink it away
I tried to put one in the air
I tried to dance it away
I tried to change it with my hair

I ran my credit card bill up
Thought a new dress would make it better
I tried to work it away 
But that just made me even sadder 

I tried to keep myself busy
I ran around in circles
Think I made myself dizzy
I slept it away, I sexed it away
I read it away

Away
Away, away, away, away, away
Away, away, away, away, away

Well it's like cranes in the sky
Sometimes I don't wanna feel those metal cloud
Well it's like cranes in the sky
Sometimes I don't wanna feel those metal-


La, la, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la, la


La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la


Yeah


Away, away, away, away, away
Away, away, away, away, away
Away, away, away, away, away

[Verse 1]
With every passing moment
Thoughts of you run through my head
Every time that I'm near you
I realize that you're heaven sent, baby

[Pre-Chorus]
I think you're truly something special
Just what my dreams are really made of
Let's stay together, you and me, boy
There's no one like you around, oh baby

[Chorus]
I really like
What you've done to me
I can't really explain it
I'm so into you
I really like
What you've done to me
I can't really explain it
I'm so into you

[Verse 2]
Could be that way you hold me
Could be the things that you say
Oh, I'm not sure what it is boy
But I know I like feeling this way

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, I think you're truly something special
Just what my dreams are really made of
Let's stay together, you and me, boy
There's no one like around, oh baby

And I'm so...

[Verse 1]
You all in your feelings, baby, all into me
I'm one in a billion, baby, don'tyouagree?

[Pre-Chorus]
Obviously, you know,I'm aware of that
I'm breakin' heartslike a heart attack
Got him right where the carats at

[Chorus]
Wrapped 'round my finger like a ring, ring, ring
They just like puppets on a string, string, string
I put it down, they call me up
They doin' way too much
So I'll just let it ring, ring, ring 

[Verse 2]
Yeah, I received your message, all twenty-three 
You know I'm Jordan with it, G-O-A-T 

[Pre-Chorus]
Obviously, you know, I'm aware of that
I'm breakin' hearts like a heart attack
I got him right where the carats at 

[Chorus]
Wrapped 'round my finger like a ring, ring, ring
They just like puppets on a string, string, string
I put it down, they call me up
They doin' way too much
So I'll just let it ring, ring, ring
Wrapped 'round my finger like a ring, ring, ring
They wanna give me everything, thing, thing
I put it down, they call me up
Oh, no, no, no, no, no
So I'll just let it ring, ring, ring

[Bridge]
Circlin' me, they just like satellites 
Circlin' me all day and every night 
Circlin' me, I'm sure you sympathize 
A-la-la-la-la-la-la-la 
Oh, na-na

[Chorus]
Wrapped 'round my finger like a ring, ring, ring

Oh, no, no, no, no, no
So I'll just let it ring, ring, ring

[Verse 1]
Sorry if it's hard to catch my vibe
I need a lover to trust, tell me you're on my side
Are you down for the ride?
It's not easy for someone to catch my eye
But I've been waitin' for you for my whole damn life

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't be afraid to tell me if you ain't with it
I see you're focused, yeah you're so independent
It's hard for me to open up, I'll admit it
You've got something to say and I'm here to listen

[Chorus]
So baby, tell me where your love lies
Waste the day and spend the night
Underneath the sunrise
Show me where your love lies

[Verse 2]
I've been so into your mystery
Is it because of our history?
Are you into me?
When it feels so good, but it's bad for you
Can't say I don't want it 'cause I know I do
Come on over, I need your company
Cravin' that synergy

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't be afraid to tell me if you ain't with it
I see you're focused, yeah you're so independent
It's hard for me to open up, I'll admit it
You've got something to say and I'm here to listen

[Chorus]
So baby
Tell me, tell me
Underneath the sunrise
Oh

[Bridge]
Are you down? Don't hide it
Feelin' me, you don't gotta deny it
Baby you gon' make me overnight it
Tell me, are you down?
Tell me, are you down?
Don't hide it
You don't gotta deny it
Tell me, tell me, are you down?

[Chorus]
Tell me where your love lies
Waste the day and spend the night
Underneath the sunrise
Tell me where your love lies
Show me where your love lies
Oh, ahTell me who pimpin, who sippin?

[Verse 1]
To be young and in love in New York City
To not know who I am but still know that I'm good long as you're here with me
To be drunk and in love in New York City
Midnight into morning coffee, burning through the hours talking
Damn

[Chorus]
I like me better when I'm with you
I like me better when I'm with you
I knew from the first time, I'd stay for a long time, 'cause
I like me better when, I like me better when I'm with you

[Verse 2]
I don't know what it is but I got that feeling
Waking up in this bed next to you swear the room, yeah, it got no ceiling
If we lay, let the day just pass us by
I might get to too much talking, I might have to tell you something
Damn

[Chorus]
I like me better when I'm with you
I like me better when I'm with you
I knew from the first time, I'd stay for a long time, 'cause
I like me better when, I like me better when I'm with you

[Bridge]
Stay awhile, stay awhile
Stay here with me
Stay awhile, stay awhile, oh
Stay awhile, stay awhile
Stay here with me
Lay here with me, ooh

[Chorus]
I like me better when I'm with you 
I like me better when I'm with you 
I knew from the first time, I'd stay for a long time, 'cause
I like me better when, I like me better when I'm with you

[Outro]


Better when
I like me better when I'm with you

[Verse 1]
Like a spotlight the water hits me
Ran it extra cold to shake the words from my mouth
Though I know that no ones listening
I nervously rehearse for when you're around
And I keep waiting like you might change my mind

[Chorus]
Who wrote the book on goodbye?
There's never been a way to make this easy
When there's nothing quite wrong but it don't feel right
Either your head or your heart, you set the other on fire

[Verse 2]
Back and forth now I'm feelin' guilty
'Cause I just can't stop this pendulum in my head
Though I know that our time is ending
Oh, I'd rather lay forever right in this bed
And I keep waiting like, you might change my mind
Give me one more night

[Chorus]
Who wrote the book on goodbye?
There's never been a way to make this easy
When there's nothing quite wrong but it don't feel right
Either your head or your heart, you set the other on fire

[Pre-Chorus]
No one knows 
No one knows 

[Bridge]
We fell from the peak
And the stars, they broke their code
I'm trying to forget
How I landed on this road
I'm caught in between
What I wish and what I know
When they say that you just know

[Chorus]
Who wrote the book on goodbye?
There's never been a way to make this easy
When there's nothing quite wrong but it don't feel right
Either your head or your heart, you set the other on fire

[Post-Chorus]
No one knows 
No one knows 
No one knows 

[Outro]
You set the other on fire
You set the other on fire
[Verse 1]
All I know is 
We could go anywhere, we could do
Anything, girl, whatever the mood we're in
All I know is 
Getting lost late at night, under stars
Finding love standing right where we are, your lips
They pull me in the moment, you and I alone and
People may be watching, I don't mind
'Cause

[Chorus]
Anywhere with you feels right
Anywhere with you feels like
Paris in the rain
Paris in the rain
We don't need a fancy town
Or bottles that we can't pronounce
'Cause anywhere, babe
Is like Paris in the rain
When I'm with you
When I'm with you
Paris in the rain
Paris in the rain

[Verse 2]
I look at you now and I want this forever
I might not deserve it but there's nothing better
Don't know how I ever did it all without you
My heart is about to, about to jump out of my chest
Feelings they come and they go, that they do
Feelings they come and they go, not with you
The late nights and the street lights and the people
Look at me, girl, and the whole world could stop

[Chorus]
Anywhere with you feels right
Anywhere with you feels like
Paris in the rain
Paris in the rain
We don't need a fancy town
Or bottles that we can't pronounce
'Cause anywhere, babe
Is like Paris in the rain
When I'm with you 
When I'm with you 
Paris in the rain
Paris in the rain 

[Bridge]
Girl, when I'm not with you
All I do is miss you
So come and set the mood right
Underneath the moonlight

Paint you with my eyes closed
Wonder where the time goes

So come and set the mood right
Underneath the moonlight

[Outro]
'Cause anywhere with you feels right
Anywhere with you feels like
Paris in the rain
Paris in the rain
Walking down an empty street
Puddles underneath our feet

[Verse 1]
I've watched those eyes light up with a smile
River in the not good times
Oh, you taught me all that I know 
I've seen your soul grow just like a rose
Made it through all of those thorns
Girl into the woman I know

[Pre-Chorus]
And it's killing me, me to say "I'm fine," "I'm fine"
When I really mean, mean to say...

[Chorus]
You're my all and more
All I know you taught me, yeah
You're my all and more
But I need room to breathe, yeah

[Verse 2]
I found New York laying in your arms
We'll melt into the bedroom floor
Never knew I'd stay for so long
And this truth cuts not through one, but both
Not through one, but both of us
But it's deeper if I hold on

[Pre-Chorus]
And it's killing me, me to say "I'm fine," "I'm fine"
When I really mean, mean to say...

[Chorus]
You're my all and more
All I know you taught me, yeah
You're my all and more
But I need room to breathe, yeah
Ooh-oh-oh
Ooh-oh-oh
Ooh-oh-oh

[Bridge]
Gotta breathe for me, it's now or never
Gotta breathe for me, it's now or never 
Ooh-oh-oh
Ooh-oh-oh
Ooh-oh-oh
I should leave, 'cause you deserve better, better
Gave my all and more
But I need room to be me

[Chorus]
You're my all and more
All I know you taught me, yeah 
You're my all and more
But I need room to breathe, yeah 
Ooh-oh-oh
Ooh-oh-oh
Ooh-oh-oh

[Outro]
Breathe
Ooh-oh-oh
Ooh-oh-oh
Ooh-oh-oh
Breathe

[Verse 1: Lauv]
You touch me and its almost like we knew
That there will be history between us two
We knew someday that we would have regrets
But we just ignored them the night we met
We just dance backwards into each other
Trying to keep our feelings secretly covered
You touch me and its almost like we knew
That there will be history

[Chorus: Lauv & Julia Michaels]
But theres no way that its not going there
With the way that were looking at each other
Theres no way that its not going there
Every second with you, I want another
But maybe we could hold off for one sec
So we could keep this tension in check
But theres no way that its not going there
With the way that were looking at each other

[Verse 2: Julia Michaels, Lauv & Both]
I wish I could make the time stop
So we could forget everything and everyone
I wish that the time would line up
So we could just give in to what we want
'Cause when I got somebody, you don't
And when you got somebody, I don't
I wish that the time would line up
So we could just give in

[Chorus: Lauv & Julia Michaels]
But theres no way that its not going there

With the way that were looking at each other
Theres no way that its not going there

Every second with you, I want another
But maybe we could hold off for one sec
So we could keep this tension in check
But theres no way that its not going there

With the way that were looking at each other

[Bridge: Lauv & Julia Michaels]
We just dance backwards into each other
Tryna keep our feelings secretly covered
We just dance backwards into each other

Trying to keep our feelings secretly covered

You touched me and it's almost like we knew
That there would be history

[Chorus: Lauv & Julia Michaels]
But theres no way that its not going there

With the way that were looking at each other
Theres no way that its not going there

Every second with you, I want another
But maybe we could hold off for one sec
So we could keep this tension in check
But theres no way that its not going there

With the way that were looking at each other

[Outro: Lauv & Julia Michaels]
We just keep on dancing right into each other
We just keep on dancing right into each other

[Verse 1]
Stick, stick to your stones 'cause that's all you know
I was caught in the middle
I swallow my words down to the bone
'Cause nothing's that simple

[Pre-Chorus]
Late at night, you pour it out
Know that only brings you down

[Chorus]
But go ahead give me all the blame
Twist my words and set them to flame, woah
We all know
That you'll go tell all of your friends
That I'm the one you wish you never met
And woah
We all know

The story never ends, ends
The story never ends, ends

[Verse 2]
Wound me like a toy spinning too fast
In every direction
How, how could I stay when you lit a match to all my intentions?

[Pre-Chorus]
Late at night, you pour it out
Know that only brings you down

[Chorus]
But go ahead give me all the blame
Twist my words and set them to flame, woah
We all know
That you'll go tell all of your friends
That I'm the one you wish you never met
And woah
We all know

The story never ends, ends
The story never ends, ends

[Bridge]
Thats who you are
Crash the car
And blame the road

Never your fault
After all
I would know

The story never ends

The story...

The story never ends, ends
The story never ends, ends

The story...
The story...
The story...
The story...

[Verse 1]
Didn't wanna be a ghost
But you pushed me over and over
Never thought I'd have a vice
Other than you, over and over

[Refrain]
Left you in the sky with the fire below
Thought I had it right, but I'm still

[Chorus]
Lost in the light
And I don't know what night it is
You're somewhere else, I'm drinking not to guess
Blurry bodies, but you're on my mind
We let it go now I'm full of rum and regret
I go out just so I can reforget

[Hook]
I go out just so I, can reforget 
I go out just so I, can reforget 
I go out, go out

[Verse 2]
I never thought a sunrise
Could burn more than a midnight without you
Already paying for tonight
Head spins like carousel, over and over

[Refrain]
Left you in the sky with the fire below
Thought I had it right, but I'm still

[Chorus]
Lost in the light
And I don't know what night it is
You're somewhere else, I'm drinking not to guess
Blurry bodies, but you're on my mind
We let it go now I'm full of rum and regret
I go out just so I can reforget

[Hook]
I go out just so I, can reforget 
I go out just so I, can reforget 
I go out just so I, can reforget 
I go out just so I, can reforget 
I go out, go out

[Bridge]
Two more footsteps on the wood floor, but it ain't you
I'm faded so I bring someone home
Over and over, I do this and I'm still

[Chorus]
Lost in the light 
And I don't know what night it is 
You're somewhere else, I'm drinking not to guess 
Blurry bodies, but you're on my mind 
We let it go now I'm full of rum and regret
I go out just so I can reforget

[Hook]
I go out just so I, can reforget 
I go out just so I, can reforget 
I go out just so I, can reforget 
I go out just so I, can reforget 
I go out, go out

[Verse 1: Lauv]
Outlines of your eyes and visions of you
Girl, I think I need a minute
To figureoutwhat is, whatisn't
These choices and voices, they're allin my head
Sometimes you make me feel crazy
Sometimes I swear I think you hate me like, uh
I need a walk, I need a walk
I need to get outta here
'Cause I need to know

[Chorus: Lauv]
Who are you?
'Cause you're not the girl I fell in love with, baby
Who are you?
'Cause something has changed, you're not the same, I hate it
I, I'm sick of waiting for love, love
I, I know that you're not the one, one

[Verse 2: Jungkook & Jimin]
Feelin' hypnotized by the words that you said
Don't lie to me, I just get in my head
When the morning comes you're still in my bed
But it's so, so cold
Who are you?
'Cause you're not the girl I fell in love with

[Chorus: Lauv & Jungkook, Jimin]
Who are you?
'Cause you're not the girl I fell in love with, baby
Who are you? 
'Cause something has changed, you're not the same, I hate it
I, I'm sick of waiting for love, love
I, I know that you're not the one, one

[Verse 1]
I've been thinkin' 'bout my father lately
The person that he made me
The person I've become
AndI'vebeen trying tofill all of this empty
But, fuck,I'm still so empty
Yeah, I could use some love

[Pre-Chorus]
And I've been trying to find a reason to get up
Been trying to find a reason for this stuff
In my bedroom and my closet
The baggage in my heart is still so dark

[Chorus]
Modern loneliness
We're never alone, but always depressed, yeah
Love my friends to death
But I never call and I never text, yeah
La-di-da-di-da
Yeah, you get what you give and you give what you get, so
Modern loneliness
We love to get high, but we don't know how to come down

[Verse 2]
If I could break my DNA to pieces
Rid of all my demons
If I could cleanse my soul
Then I could fill the world with all my problems
But, shit, that wouldn't solve them
So, I'm left here alone

[Pre-Chorus]
And I've been trying to find a reason to get up
I'm trying to find a reason for this stuff
In my bedroom and my closet
The baggage in my heart is still so dark

[Chorus]
Modern loneliness
We're never alone, but always depressed, yeah
Love my friends to death
But I never call and I never text 'em
La-di-da-di-da
Yeah, you get what you give and you give what you get, so
Modern loneliness
We love to get high, but we don't know how to come down

[Post-Chorus]
Down, down, down, down, down
We don't know how to come down
Down, down, down, down, down
We don't know how to come down
Down, down, down, down, down
We don't know how to come down
Down, down, down, down, down
We don't know how to come down

[Chorus]
Modern loneliness
We're never alone, but always depressed, yeah
Love my friends to death
But I never call and I never text 'em
La-di-da-di-da
Yeah, you get what you give and you give what you get, so
Modern loneliness
We love to get high, but we don't know how to come down

[Post-Chorus]
Down, down, down, down, down
We don't know how to come down
Down, down, down, down, down
We don't know how to come down
Down, down, down, down, down 
We don't know how to come down 
Down, down, down, down, down 
We don't know how to come down 

[Outro]
Modern loneliness
We're never alone, but always depressed, yeah

[Verse 1]
Is my love too much?
Or is it just enough for you, for you?
'Cause it's gettinglate,would you liketo stay? Ah
'Cause I'm bad atreading signs

[Pre-Chorus]
But I, I wanna do whatever you wanna do
If you wanted to, girl, we could cross that line
Know we've been friends
And love only knows broken ends
Yeah, that's what you said
But girl, let me change your mind

[Chorus]
Mmm, mmm, mmm
'Cause feelings are hard to find
Mmm, mmm, mmm
Feelings are hard

[Verse 2]
But I feel 'em in my chest
A tiny war within
But when I pull you closer
Girl, I can't explain

[Pre-Chorus]
But I, I wanna do whatever you wanna do
If you wanted to, girl, we could cross that line
Know we've been friends
And love only knows broken ends
Yeah, that's what you said
But girl, let me change your mind

[Chorus]
Mmm, mmm, mmm
'Cause feelings are hard to find
Mmm, mmm, mmm
Feelings are hard, yeah

[Bridge]
And I know, and I know that it hurts sometimes
That it hurts sometimes when I'm with you
And I know, and I know that it hurts sometimes
That it hurts sometimes, but I miss you
And I know, and I know that it's on your mind
That it's on your mind when I kiss you
But I wanna do whatever you wanna do

[Pre-Chorus]
I wanna do whatever you wanna do
If you wanted to, girl, we could cross that line
Know we've been friends
And love only knows broken ends
Yeah, that's what you said
But girl, let me change your mind

[Chorus]
Mmm, mmm, mmm
'Cause feelings are hard to find
Mmm, mmm, mmm
Feelings are hard to find, yeah

[Verse 1]
You got a way of makin' me feel insane
Like I can't trust my own brain
Unless it's screaming your name
I'd have it no other way
I'd have it no other way
And maybe that's why I stay
How many times can we pick up the same fight?
Can we keep screaming all night
And make up until it's light?
That's when I say that you're right
And feel your body on mine
Oh maybe that's why I stay

[Chorus]
I could be somewhere chillin' on the beach
I could be with someone makin' me happy
But that would be too easy, love
And I don't want no easy love
I could put my phone down, just pick up my keys
I could let you go, and we could let it be
But that would be too easy, love
And I don't want no easy love

[Verse 2]
Keep comin' back, guess you could say I'm attached
Last time we called it a wrap, I came beggin' and all that
You're like a habit, it's bad
I got a habit, it's bad
Oh no, I'm not even mad

[Chorus]
I could be somewhere chillin' on the beach
I could be with someone makin' me happy
But that would be too easy, love
And I don't want no easy love
I could put my phone down, just pick up my keys
I could let you go, and we could let it be
But that would be too easy, love
And I don't want no easy love

[Bridge]
It's the way you keep me up all night
It's the way you make me lose my mind
Every time I'm sayin' one more night
It's the way you know I'm yours
It's the way you know I'm yours for life

[Chorus]
'Cause I could be somewhere chillin' on the beach
I could be with someone makin' me happy
But that would be too easy, love
And I don't want no easy love
I could put my phone down, just pick up my keys
I could let you go, and we could let it be
But that would be too easy, love
And I don't want no easy love

[Chorus]
I met a superhero
I lost her
I want her back
She did things to me that no one else could
And I miss that

[Post-Chorus]
Ohhh
Dont wanna talk about it
Oooh
I was so wrong about it
Oooh
Cant do a thing about it now
Now

[Verse]
Cause they say if you love her let her go
And they say if its meant to be youll know

[Chorus]
I met a superhero
I lost her
I want her back
She did things to me that no one else could
And I miss that
Yeah
I met a superhero
I lost her
I want her back
She did things to me that no one else could
And I miss that
I miss that
I miss that
I miss that

[Bridge]
Ohhh

Oooh
I was so wrong about it
Oooh
Cant do a thing about it now
Now
Ohhh
Dont wanna talk about it
Oooh
I was so wrong about it
Oooh
Cant do a thing about it now
Now

[Chorus]
And they say if its meant to be youll know
I met a superhero
I lost her
I want her back
She did things to me that no one else could
And damn, I miss that

[Verse 1]
Running from the morning
Think I hit a wall
Late nights, not you
Running from the moment
So I don't recall
Late nights, not you
Waking up in a cold sweat
Someone else in this cold bed
I'd do anything to not be alone
All alone with the ceiling
All alone with this feeling
And I wonder if I'll ever let go

[Pre-Chorus]
I tried spending my nights under someone new
But the truth is
I could spend my whole life getting over you

[Chorus]
Yeah, yeah
Getting over you
Getting over you
Getting over you
Getting over you
Getting over you
Getting over you

[Verse 2]
Drowning in my coffee
To wash the alcohol
Out my bloodstream
Sitting here I wonder
If we hadn't been at all
Who would I be?
Waking up in a cold sweat
Someone else in this cold bed
And I wonder if I'll ever let go 

[Pre-Chorus]
I tried spending my nights under someone new
But the truth is
I could spend my whole life getting over you

[Chorus]
Yeah, yeah
Getting over you
Getting over you
Getting over you
Getting over you
Getting over you
Getting over you
Getting over you
Getting over you
Getting over you
Getting over you
Getting over you
Getting over you

[Pre-Chorus]
I tried spending my nights under someone new
But the truth is
I could spend my whole life getting over you

[Outro]
Getting over you
Getting over you
Getting over you
Getting over you

[Verse 1]
We were so beautiful
We were so tragic
No other magic could ever compare
Lost myself, seventeen
Then you came, found me
No other magic could ever compare

[Pre-Chorus 1]
There's a room
In my heart with the memories we made
Took 'em down but they're still in their frames
There's no way I could ever forget, mmm

[Chorus]
For as long as I live and as long as I love
I will never not think about you
You, mmm
I will never not think about you
From the moment I loved, I knew you were the one
And no matter what I-I do, ooh, mmm
I will never not think about you

[Refrain]
What we had only comes
Once in a lifetime
For the rest of mine, always compare

[Pre-Chorus 2]
To the room
In my heart with the memories we made
Nights on fifth, inbetween B and A
There's no way I could ever forget, mmm

[Chorus]
For as long as I live and as long as I love
I will never not think about you
You, mmm
I will never not think about you
From the moment I loved, I knew you were the one
And no matter what I-I do, ooh, mmm
I will never not think about you

[Bridge]
Didn't we have fun?
Didn't we have fun, looking back?
Didn't we have fun?
Didn't we have fun?
Didn't we have fun?
Didn't we have fun, looking back?
Didn't we have fun?
Didn't we have fun?

[Outro]
We were so beautiful
We were so tragic
No other magic could ever compare

[Verse 1]
I wanna hate you 'cause I still love you
And it's weighing on my chest
We keep our bodies tied together
To ignore what's coming next

[Pre-Chorus]
I was driving you home in the middle of the night
But I couldn't bring myself to say goodbye
I was driving you home in the middle of the night
And there's no good way, yeah there's no good way

[Chorus]
I'm chasing fire when I'm running after you, you
You got that something that I never wanna lose, lose, yeah
It's like dancing when the song's already over
Moving without getting any closer, oh
I'm chasing fire when I'm running after you

[Verse 2]
I wanna feel you, really feel you
Not just hold you close at night
We keep our bodies tied together
To ignore what's on our minds, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
I was driving you home in the middle of the night
But I couldn't bring myself to say goodbye
I was driving you home in the middle of the night
And there's no good way, yeah there's no good way

[Chorus]
I'm chasing fire when I'm running after you, you
You got that something that I never wanna lose, lose, yeah
It's like dancing when the song's already over
Moving without getting any closer, oh
I'm chasing fire when I'm running after you

[Post-Chorus]
Keep chasing fire
No other way, no other way
Keep chasing fire
No other way, no other way

[Pre-Chorus]
I was driving you home in the middle of the night
But I couldn't bring myself to say goodbye
I was driving you home
Even if I go, even if I stay

[Chorus]
I'm chasing fire when I'm running after you, you
You got that something that I never wanna lose, lose, yeah
It's like dancing when the song's already over
Moving without getting any closer, oh
I'm chasing fire when I'm running after you

[Post-Chorus]
Keep chasing fire
No other way, no other way
Keep chasing fire
No other way, no other way

[Verse 1]
I'm getting rid of all my clothes I dont wear
I think I'm gonna cut myhair
'Causethese days, Idont feel like me, mmm
I thinkI'm gonna take a break from alcohol
Probably won't last that long
But Lord knowsIcould use somesleep, mmm

[Chorus]
Changes, they might drive you half-insane
But it'skilling you to stay the same
But it's all gonna work out, it's all gonna work out someday
Moments, livin' with your eyes half-open
You've been thinking bout these changes
Its all gonna work out, it's all gonna work out someday

[Verse 2]
I think Im gonna take some pills to fix my brain
'Cause I tried every other way
But some things you can't fix yourself
But it's sad that hes doing the same thing over and over
And life ain't easy these days, no, life ain't easy these days

[Chorus]
Changes , they might drive you half-insane 
But it'skilling you to stay the same 
But it's all gonna work out, it's all gonna work out someday
Moments , livin' with your eyes half-open 
You've been thinking 'bout these changes 
It's all gonna work out, it's all gonna work out someday

[Chorus]
Changes, they might drive you half-insane
But it'skilling you to stay the same
But it's all gonna work out, it's all gonna work out someday
Moments , living with your eyes half-open 
You've been thinking 'bout these changes 
It's all gonna work out, it's all gonna work out someday

[Verse 1]
I wish that you and I lived in The Sims
We could build a house and plant some flowers and have kids
But we're both out at some trashy Halloween party downtown
And I'll probably never see you again
I wish that we lived on a VHS
I'd erase the things I said and that I'll probably say again
Hit rewind on all the times I got lost in my head
But I guess I'll never see you again
I'll probably never see you again

[Chorus]
Ooh, God damn
I wish we would've met on another night, baby
Maybe then I wouldn't have let you leave me
Yeah, ooh, God damn
I wish we would've met on another night, baby
In another life, maybe
In another

[Post-Chorus]
I wouldn't have let you
I wouldn't have let you
I wouldn't have let you
I wouldn't have

[Verse 2]
I wish that we met walkin' round the MoMA
Yeah, I'd say "Nice to meet you"
Instead of saying "Nice to know you"
I'd try to impress you with some bullshit about Monet
At least I wouldn't be too drunk to stay
And I wouldn't have let you slip away

[Chorus]
Ooh, God damn
I wish we would've met on another night, baby
Maybe then I wouldn't have let you leave me
Yeah, ooh, God damn
I wish we would've met on another night, baby
In another life, maybe
In another 

[Post-Chorus]
I wouldn't have let you
I wouldn't have let you
I wouldn't have let you
I wouldn't have
I wouldn't have let you
I wouldn't have let you
I wouldn't have let you
I wouldn't have

[Outro]
I wouldn't have let you
I wouldn't have let you
I wouldn't have let you
I wouldn't have let you leave me

[Verse 1]
Another life, another story
She walked out, said I was boring
About 3 AM, that's when I called my friends
We hit the bar, sent myself flying
Shit I said I'm never trying
'Til the bitter end, but every now and then
I wonder what it feels like to be more than I am

[Chorus]
I traded all my friends for drugs and the internet
Ah shit, am I a winner yet?
Look quick, is he a winner yet?
Mom's back home with a drink and a cigarette
I traded all my friends for drugs and the internet
Ah shit, am I a winner yet?
Look quick, hasn't hit him yet
Mom's back home with a drink and a cigarette

[Post Chorus]
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Still hasn't hit him yet

[Verse 2]
And I don't wanna base my actions
On reactions or the things they say
And I don't wanna hit delete
On all the parts of me that they might hate
So now I'm laying in my bed
And I can't get out my head
It's all because, all because

[Chorus]
I traded all my friends for drugs and the internet
Ah shit, am I a winner yet?
Look quick, is he a winner yet?
Mom's back home with a drink and a cigarette
I traded all my friends for drugs and the internet
Ah shit, am I a winner yet?
Look quick, hasn't hit him yet
Mom's back home with a drink and a cigarette

[Post Chorus]
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Still hasn't hit him yet
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Still hasn't hit him yet

[Outro]

I sold my soul 
And all I got 
The likes from strangers, love on the internet 
Drugs and the internet
I wonder what it feels like
To be more than I am, I am

[Intro]
Can we call it kinda? Yeah
When we met
That seems really good

[Verse 1]
When we met, I wasn'tme
Iwas so numb,yeah, I was so lonely
Out onthe run, I wasn't free
And you came along, but you couldn't save me

[Pre-Chorus]
My hesitation and holdin' my breath
I led you into the garden of my loneliness
Wished that you left before it all burned down

[Chorus]
Oh, Julia
I'm sorry what I do to ya
I push and pull and mess with your head
Then get in your bed 'cause I'm weak deep down
Oh, Julia
I wish I never lied to ya
I never meant to hurt you like that
And if I could go back, I'd leave you alone

[Verse 2]
When I left, I wasn't sure
That I could love, love anymore

[Pre-Chorus]
But my hesitation and holdin' my breath
I led you into the garden of my loneliness
Wished that you left before it all burned down

[Chorus]
Oh, Julia
I'm sorry what I do to ya
I push and pull and mess with your head
Then get in your bed 'cause I'm weak deep down
Oh, Julia
I wish I never lied to ya
I never meant to hurt you like that
And if I could go back, I'd leave you alone

[Outro]
I won't lie to you no more
I won't lie to you no more
'Cause I know I did before
Hope you find what you're looking for

[Verse 1]
Laying here wrapped in white just trying to not fight again
'Cause Ive been holding on too long just to let it end
Oh I must be walking on eggshells
Trying not to sell myself out
I bet thats what shes thinking
Thats when she said
Thats when she said

[Chorus]
Do you want it bad?
Do you want it bad?
Do you want it bad?
Yeah she said, baby do ya? 
Or are you just comfortable? 

Do you want it bad?
Do you want it bad?
Do you want it bad?
Yeah she said, baby do ya? 
Or are you just comfortable? 


[Verse 2]
Trying my best to show appreciation, oh yeah
But all apologies are just a miscommunication
Now its like Im walking on eggshells
Trying not to burn the hell out
Its like pulling magic from my mouth
Thats when she said
Thats when she said

[Chorus]
Do you want it bad?
Do you want it bad?
Do you want it bad?
Yeah she said, baby do ya? 
Or are you just comfortable? 

Do you want it bad?
Do you want it bad?
Do you want it bad?
Yeah she said, baby do ya? 
Or are you just comfortable? 

[Bridge]
Could I ever do enough to make this coffee more than bitter water?
Could I ever do enough to make you wear this love not like a collar?
Could I ever do enough to make you feel the way you want to feel?
So the next time that youre sad, tell me that

[Chorus]
Do you want it bad?
Do you want it bad?
Do you want it bad?
Uh yeah, baby do ya? 
Or are you just comfortable? 

Do you want it bad?
Do you want it bad?
Do you want it bad?
Yeah she said, baby do ya? 
Or are you just comfortable?  
Are you just comfortable? Oh

[Verse 1]
I thought we said we're good
Was I misunderstood?
You lookin' at me so cold
After all that we've been through
How could you pretend?
I'm someone that you don't know

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm so sick of planning all my nights, nights
'round avoiding you, it's gotta end
We don't have to love again or try, try
But can you tell me

[Chorus]
Oh, why do we, we have to be
Enemies, enemies?
Forget all the scars, all that they are
Memories, memories
Oh, I know it hurts 'cause I feel it too
But after all, all that we been through, yeah
Oh, why do we, we have to be
Enemies, enemies?

[Verse 2]
You see me walkin' towards
You're headed for the door
Why is your shoulder so cold?
I know it's hard to speak
With all our history
But that don't mean you should go

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm so sick of planning all my nights, nights
'round avoiding you it's gotta end
We don't have to love again or try, try
But can you tell me

[Chorus]
Oh, why do we, we have to be
Enemies, enemies?
Forget all the scars, all that they are
Memories, memories
Oh, I know it hurts 'cause I feel it too
But after all, all that we been through
Oh, why do we, we have to be
Enemies, enemies?

[Bridge]
Oh, tell me why did, why did we
Throw away the love we had?
And tell me why do, why do we
Love to make it hurt so bad
Yeah, I know that we can't be friends
But after all the things we been
Oh, why do we, we have to be enemies? Oh

[Chorus]
Oh, why do we, we have to be
Enemies, enemies?
Forget all the scars, all that they are
Memories, memories
Oh, I know it hurts 'cause I feel it too
But after all, all that we been through, yeah
Oh, why do we, we have to be
Enemies, enemies?

[Verse 1]
Remembering what you said
Now I'm laying alone in bed
Trying to wrap up this feeling
Falling apart instead

'Cause baby we hit the top
Sweeter than sugar rocks
Holding onto a moment
Let go, I'm falling off

[Pre-Chorus]
I just need a little of it
Need a little, not a lot to get into it
Oh
Keep calling me home

[Chorus]
Can we go back to adrenaline?
Can we go back to adrenaline?
Girl you know that weve been settling, settling
But I need to feel, need to feel it
Adrenaline

[Verse 2]
Remembering all those nights
With your body straight to the sky
You work me until the morning
Fall asleep half past nine 

So crazy in love
Enough was never enough
Tell me our touch aint dull now


[Pre-Chorus]
I just need a little of it
Need a little, not a lot to get into it
Oh
Keep calling me home

[Chorus]
Can we go back to adrenaline?
Can we go back to adrenaline?
Girl you know that weve been settling, settling
But I need to feel, need to feel it
Adrenaline

[Bridge]
And I dont know where the ceiling is anymore
No, I dont know where the feeling is anymore
No, I don't, don't

[Chorus]
Can we go back to adrenaline?

Can we go back to adrenaline?

Girl you know that weve been settling, settling
But I need to feel, need to feel it
Adrenaline

Ohh, ohh, ohh, ohh

Anymore, ooh, ooh, ohh, ohh

Ohh, ohh, ohh, ohh

Anymore, ooh, ooh, ohh, ohh


'Cause I need to feel, need to feel it
Adrenaline

[Chorus]
Nobody wanna see us together, but it don't matter, no

Nobody wanna see us together
But it don't matter, no

'Cause we gon' fight
Yeah, we gon' fight
Believe we gon' fight
Fight for our right to love, yeah
Nobody wanna see us together
But it don't matter, no


[Verse 1]
Nobody wanna see us together
Nobody thought we'd last forever
I feel them hopin' and prayin' things between us don't get better
Men steady comin' after you, women steady comin' after me
Seems like everybody wanna go for self
And don't wanna respect boundaries
Tellin' you all those lies just to get on yo' side
But I must admit there was a couple secrets I held inside
Just know that I try to always apologize
I'ma have you first always in my heart to keep you satisfied

[Chorus]
Nobody wanna see us together
But it don't matter, no

Nobody wanna see us together
But it don't matter, no

'Cause we gon' fight
Yeah, we gon' fight
Believe we gon' fight
Fight for our right to love, yeah
Nobody wanna see us together
But it don't matter, no


[Verse 2]
Got every right to wanna leave, got every right to wanna go
Got every right to hit the road then never talk to me no mo'
You don't even have to call, even check for me at all
'Cause the way I've been actin' lately has been off the wall
Especially towards you, puttin' girls before you
They've been watchin' everything I been doin' just to hurt you
Most of it just ain't true and they won't show you
How much of a queen you are to me and why I love you, baby

[Hook]
Nobody wanna see us together
But it don't matter, no

Nobody wanna see us together
But it don't matter, no

'Cause we gon' fight
Yeah, we gon' fight
Believe we gon' fight
Fight for our right to love, yeah
Nobody wanna see us together
But it don't matter, no


[Bridge]
Oh, oh-whoa-oh-oh
'Cause I got you, babe
Oh, oh-whoa-oh-oh
'Cause I got you babe
'Cause I got you babe
Oh, oh-whoa-oh-oh
Oh, oh-whoa-oh-oh

[Hook]
Nobody wanna see us together
But it don't matter, no

Nobody wanna see us together
But it don't matter, no

'Cause we gon' fight
Yeah, we gon' fight
Believe we gon' fight
Fight for our right to love, yeah
Nobody wanna see us together
But it don't matter, no
[Verse 1]
Doubt, doubt, doubt
It kills everything that you love
Now, now, now
Im losing myself on the run

[Pre-Chorus]
And I flew to California
Thought I could leave
Every piece of you right here
Yeah I flew to California
Still wide awake
Oh the sun burned it on clear

[Chorus]
How I still love you
I still love you
But sometimes you have to go
Trade your heart for bones
To know you need to come back home
Come back home

[Verse 2]
Paint-chipped skies
Nothing is ever as it seems
Behind these codeine eyes
Blind to the world in between

[Pre-Chorus]
And I flew to California
Thought I could leave
Every piece of you right here
Yeah I flew to California
Still wide awake
Oh the sun burned it on clear

[Chorus]
How I still love you
I still love you
But sometimes you have to go
Trade your heart for bones
To know you need to come back home
Come back home

[Bridge]
Getaway
I always thought I needed a getaway
Getaway
I always thought I needed a getaway
Getaway
I always thought I needed a getaway
Getaway
I always thought I needed a getaway

[Chorus]
But I still love you
I still love you
But sometimes you have to go
Trade your heart for bones
To know you need to come back home
Come back home

[Outro]
Getaway
I always thought I needed a getaway
Getaway
I always thought I needed a getaway
Getaway
I always thought I needed a getaway
Getaway
I always thought I needed a getaway

[Verse 1]
Daydream
Life feels like a daydream
And I just wish that I could wake up
I just wish that I could wake up
My mind
Whispers in the nighttime
Voices always keeping me up
Telling me that I should give up

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause lately, I've been in the backseat to my own life
Trying to take control, but I don't know how to

[Chorus]
I don't want to be sad forever
I don't want to be sad no more
I don't want to wake up and wonder
What the hell am I doing this for
I don't want to be medicated
I don't want to go through that war
I don't want to be sad, I don't want to be sad
I don't want to be sad anymore
I don't want to be sad forever
I don't want to go one more day
I just want to wake up and realize
Everything's going to be okay
I don't know how else to say it
I don't want to go through that war
I don't want to be sad, I don't want to be sad
I don't want to be sad anymore

[Verse 2]
I'm coming through to the other side
I'll make it through to tomorrow
'Cause that's all I can do today, do today

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause lately, I've been in the backseat to my own life
Trying to take control, but I don't know how to

[Chorus]
I don't want to be sad forever
I don't want to be sad no more
I don't want to wake up and wonder
What the hell am I doing this for
I don't want to be medicated
I don't want to go through that war
I don't want to be sad, I don't want to be sad
I don't want to be sad anymore
I don't want to be sad forever
I don't want to go one more day
I just want to wake up and realize
Everything's going to be okay
I don't know how else to say it
I don't want to go through that war
I don't want to be sad, I don't want to be sad
I don't want to be sad anymore

[Bridge]
Sad anymore
Sad anymore

[Chorus]
I don't want to be sad forever
I don't want to be sad no more
I don't want to wake up and wonder
What the hell am I doing this for
I don't want to be medicated
I don't want to go through that war
I don't want to be sad, I don't want to be sad
I don't want to be sad anymore
I don't want to be sad forever
I don't want to go one more day
I just want to wake up and realize
Everything's going to be okay
I don't know how else to say it
I don't want to go through that war
I don't want to be sad, I don't want to be sad
I don't want to be sad anymore

[Verse 1]
Said I'd never fall, I'd never fall, I'd never fall
But then I fell for you,mmm
Backagainst the wall,against the wall, against the wall
That'show it felt with you, mmm, mmm

[Pre-Chorus]
One weekend in Portland
You weren't even my girlfriend
We were walking and talking
Then somebody said let's get

[Chorus]
Tattoos together, something to remember
If it's way too soon, fuck it, whatever
Give me shapes and letters, if it's not forever
Then at least we'll have tattoos together

[Post-Chorus]
Mmm, 'cause I love you
Mmm, 'cause I love you
Mmm, 'cause I love you
Mmm, mmm

[Verse 2]
Knew it from the moment, from the moment
From the moment that I saw you naked, mmm, yeah
I could never love nobody else, nobody else
The way I loved you baby, mmm, mmm

[Pre-Chorus]
One weekend , no sleeping 
You weren't even my girlfriend, yeah
We were kissing, like, real kissing
Then somebody said let's get

[Chorus]
Tattoos together, something to remember
If it's way too soon, fuck it, whatever
Give me shapes and letters, if it's not forever
Then at least we'll have tattoos together

[Post-Chorus]
Mmm, 'cause I love you
Mmm, 'cause I love you
Mmm, 'cause I love you
Mmm, tattoos together

[Bridge]
Yeah, your cherry earrings are my favorite
They look so good, I had to save it
I've been hoping, praying we last forever
'Cause there's nothing better than you and I

[Chorus]
Tattoos together, something to remember
If it's way too soon, fuck it, whatever
Give me shapes and letters, if it's not forever
Then at least we'll have tattoos together

[Post-Chorus]
Mmm, 'cause I love you
Mmm, 'cause I love you
Mmm, 'cause I love you 
Mmm, mmm 

[Outro]
Oh, alright
Mmm, alright
Mmm, huh

[Verse 1]
Didn't know what I wanted, I'll admit that
Still don't know what I'm wantin'
I'll be honest, I'm not ready to let you go

[Pre-Chorus]
I walk down memory lane late at night
I end up losing my way every time
I wake up missing you more
Oh, why did I say goodbye?

[Chorus]
I used to have you, now I have this bracelet
I used to have you, now I have this bracelet
I let you go but baby, I'm gonna wear it
Until I don't need to
Until I don't need you
All I know is I can't face it
I used to have you, now I have this bracelet
I let you go but baby, I'm gonna wear it
Until I don't need to
Until I don't need you

[Verse 2]
Anyway I could toss it, I'll admit that
That don't mean that I need to
Keep you wrapped around my wrist
Oh no 

[Pre-Chorus]
I walk down memory lane late at night
I end up losing my way every time
I wake up missing you more
Oh, why did I say goodbye?

[Chorus]
I used to have you, now I have this bracelet
I used to have you, now I have this bracelet
I let you go but baby, I'm gonna wear it
Until I don't need to
Until I don't need you
All I know is I cant face it
I used to have you, now I have this bracelet
I let you go but baby, I'm gonna wear it
Until I dont need to
Until I dont need you

[Bridge]
And another day is passing by
Oh, I still need you
Oh, I still need you
And another day is passing by
Oh, I still need you
Oh, I still need you
All of these Melatonin tears I cry
Oh, I still need you
Oh, I still need you


[Chorus]
I used to have you, now I have this bracelet
I used to have you, now I have this bracelet
I let you go but baby, I'm gonna wear it
Until I don't need to
Until I don't need you
All I know is I can't face it
I used to have you, now I have this bracelet
I let you go but baby, I'm gonna wear it
Until I don't need to
Until I don't need you

[Outro]
I walk down memory lane late at night
I end up losing my way every time
I wake up missing you more, missing you more
Oh, is it goodbye?
Bye, bye, bye, bye
Is it goodbye?
Bye, bye, bye, bye
Missing you more oh, why?

[Verse 1: Lauv]
It's not me you're really mad at
I see it in your eyes
She's always had you pissed off
And you hold it deep inside
I'm telling you to let go, let go
You told me give you a chance
To feel the way you feel, but so you know
Even if I don't quite understand

[Pre-Chorus: Lauv]
Baby, I'll stand
Even if I'm blind, I'll pay no mind
Baby, I'll stand
Even when you drive me half, you drive me half insane
If you promise that and then it's not in vain
If you'll always do the same for me

[Chorus: Lauv]
I won't question, question it
I won't question, question it
I won't question, question it
Hey hey hey, hey hey hey, hey hey

[Verse 2: Lauv]
You think I'm oblivious
Maybe that's true
I don't notice, my heart is too focused
On trying to do right by you, by you, by you
I can't control the actions, actions
Of somebody else
Don't give them satisfaction, no
Just leave them on the shelf, oh baby

[Pre-Chorus: Lauv]
You know I'll stand
Even if I'm blind, I'll pay no mind
Baby, I'll stand
Even when you drive me half, you drive me half insane
If you promise that and then it's not in vain
If you'll always do the same for me

[Chorus: Lauv]
I won't question, question it
I won't question, question it
I won't question, question it
Hey hey hey, hey hey hey, hey hey

[Verse 3: Travis Mills]
Why do LA girls always have this attitude from out of nowhere?
Turning nothing into something, oh girl please don't go there
I even changed my number, I don't know how they're still calling
Just come back to bed, I'll fix all this shit in the morning
It's nothing I can't handle, don't wanna waste these candles
As soon as we get done another one like Khaled's sandals
First thing I'll do is make sure you won't ever second guess it
You know I love you, that ain't a question

[Chorus: Lauv]
I won't question, question it
I won't question, question it
I won't question, question it
Hey hey hey, hey hey hey, hey hey

[Outro: Lauv]
I'll always
Put it down, down, down for you baby
Put it down, down, down for you baby
Put it down, down, down for you baby
Hey hey hey, hey hey hey, hey hey
Put it down, down, down for you baby
Put it down, down, down, down, down, down
Put it down, down, down for you baby
Put it down, down, down, down, down, down
Put it down, down, down for you baby
Put it down, down, down, down, down, down
Put it down, down, down for you baby...

[Verse 1]
Smile when you're sleeping
Wonder who you're dreaming of
Oh, 'cause I could just see you with wine on your t-shirt
And somebody else on your arm
Can't control this feeling
Wonder who you're dreaming of
After all of these nights laying right by your side
How could my brain make me feel so far?

[Chorus]
Maybe it's a case of paranoia
Nervous that I'll never really know ya
What do I feel? Who do I trust?
Maybe it's real, or maybe I'm just...

[Breakdown]
Paranoid
Paranoid
Maybe I'm just
Paranoid
Paranoid
Maybe I'm just

[Verse 2]
Never felt so naked
Lookin' at you naked
Got your hands down the back of my soul
And the more that I show you, the more I'm afraid
That you're going to wake up
And realize I'm not the one
That you thought I was, that I thought I was
Am I who I am who am I?

[Chorus]
Maybe it's a case of paranoia
Nervous that I'll never really know ya
What do I feel? Who do I trust?
Maybe it's real, or maybe I'm just...

[Breakdown]
Paranoid
Paranoid
Maybe I'm just
Paranoid
Paranoid
Maybe I'm just

[Outro]
Crazy
But baby, I love you
And baby I'd love to not be...
Paranoid
Paranoid, mm
I wish I wasn't
Paranoid, mm-mm
Maybe I'm just

[Intro]
Okay, here we go

[Verse 1]
I'll send you pictures all the time
Of our friends when they're too drunk and telling stories
I'll keep you right here in my brain
Even when we're waking up in different cities

[Pre-Chorus]
I know it's hard to feel so
Close to someone
That's so far away

[Chorus]
But for now, I'll love you through the phone
And for now, our friends will fill this home
I'm really gonna miss you, but I'll kiss you through the screen
For now, 'til you come home to me

[Verse 2]
In the shadow of the moon
Found a memory of that night we were in Portland, mmm
Of the moment I told you
That no matter where we are, you're still my best friend

[Pre-Chorus]
I know it's hard to feel so
Close to someone
That's so far away

[Chorus]
But for now, I'll love you through the phone
And for now, our friends will fill this home
Im really gonna miss you, but I'll kiss you through the screen
For now, 'til you come home to me

[Bridge]
(Da, da, da, da, da, da
Da, da, da, da, da, da, da
Da, da, da, da, da, da
Da, da, da, da, da, da, da)

[Outro]
I'm really gonna miss you, but I'll kiss you through the screen
And if I had a candle, I would wish you back to me
And next time that I see you, I'll make sure you never leave
But for now, just come home to me

[Verse 1: Lauv]
Waking up in your bed
It's almost like I've been here forever
I'm obsessed with your brain
AndI'dunfold it ifyou let me

[Chorus: Lauv]
What if we moveto Canada
And buy some things we don't need?
Bring your mother's dog
Your paintbrush and some candy
And when they talk about those
People who up and leave
That could be us
That could be you and me

[Verse 2: Alessia Cara]
How you talk with your hands
And how you sigh like a movie
And we got luck so bad we have to laugh
I guess we're lucky that we don't need much outside of us, do we?

[Chorus: Lauv & Alessia Cara]
What if we move to Canada
And buy some things we don't need?
Bring your mother's dog
Your paintbrush and some candy
And when they talk about those
People who up and leave
That could be us
That could be you and me

[Bridge: Lauv & Alessia Cara]
Ah, that could be you and me
Ah, that could be you and me
Ah, that could be you and me
Ah

[Chorus: Lauv & Alessia Cara, Alessia Cara & Lauv]
So, why don't we move to Canada
And buy some things we don't need?
Bring your mother's dog
Your paintbrush and some candy
And when they talk about those
People who up and leave
That could be us
That could be you and me
Move to Canada
And buy some things we don't need
Bring your mother's dog
Your paintbrush and some candy
And when they talk about those
People who up and leave
That could be us
That could be you and me

[Outro: Lauv]
That could be you and me

[Verse 1]
She was sixteen the first time
She had her heart broken
Truth is, I've never had mine
Now she goeson vacation
In expensive places
To get awayfrom her mind 

[Pre-Chorus]
I don't mean to be rude
There's things in myself that I see in you

[Chorus]
Lonely eyes
She had those lonely eyes
I only know 'cause I have them too
Lonely eyes
No, you don't have to hide
The things you feel inside, I feel too

[Post-Chorus]
'Cause I'm lonely just like you
'Cause I'm lonely just like you

[Verse 2]
Bask in all of the silence
In between our eyelids
Where you are, I'm right there too
We might speak different languages
And we might have differences
But where you are, I'm right there too

[Pre-Chorus]
I don't mean to be rude
There's things in myself that I see in you

[Chorus]
Lonely eyes
She had those lonely eyes
I only know 'cause I have them too
Lonely eyes
No, you don't have to hide
The things you feel inside, I feel too

[Post-Chorus]
'Cause I'm lonely just like you
'Cause I'm lonely just like you
'Cause I'm lonely just like you


[Bridge]
Stay the night, stay the week
When you're gone, I don't sleep
When you're gone, I feel weak, oh
Stay the night, stay the week
When you're gone, I don't sleep
When you're gone, I feel weak, oh

[Chorus]
Lonely eyes
She had those lonely eyes
I only know 'cause I have them too 
Lonely eyes
No, you don't have to hide
The things you feel inside, I feel too

[Outro]
'Cause I'm lonely just like you 

I'm lonely just like you 

I'm lonely just like you 
Stay the night, stay the week 
When you're gone, I don't sleep 
When you're gone, I feel weak, oh 

[Verse 1]
Billy had dreams of a sailor or an astronaut
Nobody told 'em the world was mean
Billygrewup in atrailer and nobody thought
He could amountto anything
But I knew he would because he has a heart of gold
Woah, oh, oh

[Chorus]
Ayy, woah, well look who's laughing now
'Cause Billy bought a brand new house
To all the people that were mean
He just channeled your energy
And ayy, woah, well look who's laughing now
Yeah, he said, "Thank you for your doubts"
To all the people that believed
He just channeled your energy

[Verse 2]
Billy woke up in a Tesla at twenty-three
He didn't think he earned the ride
Then Billy got down under pressure at twenty-four
He couldn't go to bed at night
'Cause he saw the world come crashin' down the way it does
Woah, oh, oh

[Chorus]
Ayy, woah, well look who's laughing now
'Cause Billy bought a brand new house
To all the people that were mean
He just channeled your energy
And ayy, woah, well look who's laughing now
Yeah, he said, "Thank you for your doubts"
To all the people that believed
He just channeled your energy

[Outro]
Now Billy is free
It's Billy, oh, oh, oh
It's Billy, it's Billy, it's Billy
Oh, oh, alright, woo

[Verse 1]
Do you still remember
The way that we felt when we were kids?
Wonder if that placestillexists, mmm
We livedfor the moment
And fear was astranger to our lips
Wonder if that place still exists

[Pre-Chorus]
Yeah, we built castles out of couches
Felt fire without matches
Made promises without fear of gettin' burned
Now we're always second-guessing
We think happy is expensive
But every time I'm with you, I relearn

[Chorus]
It's the invisible things that I, that I love the most
It's the way that I feel when I, when I hold you close
'Cause everything I lose, oh, it comes and goes
It's the invisible things that I, that I love the most
So, let me hold you close
So, let me hold you close


[Verse 2]
Do you remember
The last time we felt something like this?
The way that it felt when we were kids

[Pre-Chorus]
And we built castles out of couches
Felt fire without matches
Made promises without fear of gettin' burned
Now we're always second-guessing
We think happy is expensive
But every time I'm with you, I relearn

[Chorus]
It's the invisible things that I, that I love the most

It's the way that I feel when I, when I hold you close

'Cause everything I lose, oh, it comes and goes
It's the invisible things that I, that I love the most
So, let me hold you close
So, let me hold you close 
So, let me hold you close

[Bridge]
Way I feel and the way we kiss
Swear that nothing else in the world exists 

[Chorus]
It's the invisible things that I, that I love the most

It's the way that I feel when I, when I hold you close

'Cause everything I lose, oh, it comes and goes
It's the invisible things that, that I love the most
So, let me hold you close

[Outro]
Way I feel from the way we kiss
Swear that nothing else in the world exists 
Cross my heart if we both forget
Someday, we'll both look back and remember this 

[Verse 1]
Midtown, almost got a place out of midtown
Instead, I took a plane out of thistown
Andmissed out onus, mmm
Wasted, and all of myregret, I can taste it
If I had a time-machine I would take it
And make it back to us

[Pre-Chorus]
Now I'm reminiscing 'round the clock
Wish that I could make it stop
Didn't know it then, but now I know all this time, I, I

[Chorus]
Should've believed in us
While we existed
'Cause now the whole thing's fucked
And just a figment of my imagination
If I could bring you back, I would
But it's just way too late for that
Should've believed in us
Should've believed in us, ah, oh, oh

[Verse 2]
And I wish I would've been patient
Instead of lettin' all the emotions
Turn to motions with you, mmm

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause now I'm reminiscing 'round the clock
Wish that I could make it stop
Didn't know it then, but now I know all this time, I

[Chorus]
Should've believed in us 
While we existed
'Cause now the whole thing's fucked 
And just a figment of my imagination
If I could bring you back, I would
But it's just way too late for that
Should've believed in us
Should've believed in us, ah, oh, oh

[Bridge]
Should've believed in us
Should've believed in us, ah, oh, woah
If I could bring you back I would
But it's just way too late for that
Should've believed in
If I could bring you back I would
But it's just way too late for that

[Chorus]
Should've believed in us 
While we existed
'Cause now the whole thing's fucked 
And just a figment of my imagination
If I could bring you back I would
But it's just way too late for that
Should've believed in us
Should've believed in us, ah, oh, oh

[Intro: Sofa Reyes & Lauv]
Y primero dije "no," pero s quera 
Pa' que te fueras me invent cualquier tontera
Perodespus del tragocinco te di la mano, y
Me gust tanto lo malo que eras bailando 

[Chorus: Lauv with Sofa Reyes]
I met a girl at El Tejano, we danced
To Spanish covers of Nirvana, we danced
And got another margarita, she's from Reseda
I said, "I'm from wherever you're goin' tonight," yeah

[Verse 1: Lauv]
Drinkin' after dark, that's when she stole my heart 
She knew my friends, that's where the story begins
Standin' at the salsa bar, asked if it was mild
I was speechless, but still, I smiled
Took me by the hand and asked me if I had plans
I said, "Gettin' drunk and pretendin' that I can dance"
She laughed, I fell in love and now it's no goin' back
Once you know it, yeah, you know it, that's that

[Chorus: Lauv with Sofa Reyes]
I met a girl at El Tejano, we danced
To Spanish covers of Nirvana, we danced
And got another margarita, she's from Reseda
I said, "I'm from wherever you're goin' tonight," yeah
It's happy hour up in NoHo, we danced
She said, "I never come here solo," we danced
She's got a round of straight tequila, she's from Reseda
I said, "I'm from wherever you're goin' tonight," yeah

[Verse 2: Lauv & Sofa Reyes]
She asked if I like Friends, I guess that that was the test
I said, "Hell yeah, and Phoebe's the fuckin' best"
We were standin' at the salsa bar, feelin' the vibration 
I always find myself in random situations
Ooh, do you wanna have a little bit of fun tonight?
She said, "Ooh, I do"
Ooh, do you wanna have a little bit of fun?
Once you know it, yeah, you know it, that's that

[Chorus: Lauv with Sofa Reyes]
I met a girl at El Tejano, we danced
To Spanish covers of Nirvana, we danced
And got another margarita, she's from Reseda
I said, "I'm from wherever you're goin' tonight"
It's happy hour up in NoHo, we danced
She said, "I never come here solo," we danced
She's got a round of straight tequila, she's from Reseda
I said, "I'm from wherever you're goin' tonight"

[Verse 3: Sofa Reyes]
Y primero dije "no," pero s quera
Pa' que te fueras me invent cualquier tontera
Pero despus del trago cinco te di la mano, y
Me gust tanto lo malo que eras bailando
Djame, te enseo yo, que la cumbia es ma
Cuando se acabe esta cancin, nos vamos, quin dira no?
Mira que no salgo sola, pero llego sola
Que estoy mejor sola, pero
We're going to my place tonight

[Outro: Lauv]
I met a girl at El Tejano, we danced 
To Spanish covers of Nirvana, we danced 
And got another margarita, she's from Reseda 
I said, "I'm from wherever you're goin' tonight"

[Intro]
Oh
Oh
Oh, oh

[Chorus]
Sweatpants and songs about her
Coffee with a little bit of alcohol
Oh no, no, don'tjudgeme
Just 'cause Ido anything to get by
Oh, withouther
Xanax and a little bit of Adderall
Oh no, no, don't judge me
Just 'cause I do anything to get by

[Verse 1]
Since you don't wanna know
Who I am anymore, you don't care anymore
And I can't really blame you
No, I can't really blame you
And I don't wanna know
Who you're with when you leave, it's so hard to believe
That it's been so long
Swear I still feel you

[Pre-Chorus]
On my skin
Your scent in my sheets
Feels like just last week we were together
These days, it's all

[Chorus]
Sweatpants and songs about her
Coffee with a little bit of alcohol
Oh no, no, don't judge me
Just 'cause I do anything to get by
Oh, without her
Xanax and a little bit of Adderall
Oh no, no, don't judge me
Just 'cause I do anything to get by

[Verse 2]
No motivations, I
Just wanna tell you I
I really miss you, but baby, that's not the issue
The issue is comin' back, expectin' this time'll last when
We've been through this, we both know
We'll fight, fuck, and let it go
Again, again and again, again, again
'Cause deep down, I still want to feel you

[Pre-Chorus]
On my skin
Your scent in my sheets
Feels like just last week we were together
These days, it's all

[Chorus]
Sweatpants and songs about
Coffee with a little bit of alcohol
Oh no, no, don't judge me
Just 'cause I do anything to get by
Oh, without her
Xanax and a little bit of Adderall
Oh no, no, don't judge me
Just 'cause I do anything to get by
To get by

Sweatpants and songs about her
Coffee with a little bit of alcohol
Oh no, no, don't judge me
Just 'cause I do anything to get by

[Verse 1]
I've been thinkin' that life's too short
So many friends got their life cut short
Now I'mstandinghere doing linesin the bathroom
I hate myself, butI felt like I had to

[Pre-Chorus]
 I've been hiding pain that's underneath
And I've been up so long, I'm scared to sleep
And if something were to happen to me
Can someone please

[Chorus]
Tell my mama that I love her
And I'm sorry for the pain, sorry for the pain
That I caused her when I was younger
All the stress I put her under
Tell my mama that I love her
And I'm sorry for the pain, sorry for the pain
That I caused her when I was younger
All the stress I put her under

[Verse 2]
And everybody says that I've been manic
I think they might be right, but I still manage
Lately, I've been so annoyed
'Cause they think that I'm just paranoid

[Pre-Chorus]
 I've been hiding pain that's underneath
And I've been up so long, I'm scared to sleep
And if something were to happen to me
Can someone please

[Chorus]
Tell my mama that I love her
And I'm sorry for the pain, sorry for the pain
That I caused her when I was younger
All the stress I put her under
Tell my mama that I love her
And I'm sorry for the pain, sorry for the pain
That I caused her when I was younger
All the stress I put her under

[Bridge]
I've been thinkin' that life's too short
So many friends got their life cut short
And I remember when I said I'd never be like this
Be like this

[Chorus]
Tell my mama that I love her
And I'm sorry for the pain, sorry for the pain
That I caused her when I was younger
All the stress I put her under
Tell my mama that I love her 
And I'm sorry for the pain, sorry for the pain
That I caused her when I was younger
All the stress I put her under

[Verse 1]
I would cut these girls off for you
If you say you wanted me too
I don'tknowwhat's changed withyou
But something's different
Because you say thatyou miss me
Then you go and say that you can'tkissme
Idon't understand, you'replaying with me
WishI didn't wish that you were with me
But I do, yeah

[Chorus]
You could break my heart and Id still come back to you, oh
You could change your mind and I'd still wait here for you, oh
And I hate the fact that all these things are true
Oh, oh, oh, oh

[Verse 2]
And how long will it take to think of what you gonna say
It's been a couple of days, I haven't heard from you
Was it something I said, that made you get inside your head
Girl, you're messing my head
And now it hurts when
You say you miss me
Then you go and say that you can't kiss me
I don't understand, you're playing with me
Wish I didn't wish that you were with me
But I do, yeah

[Chorus]
You could break my heart and Id still come back to you, oh
You could change your mind and I'd still wait here for you, oh
And I hate the fact that all these things are true
Oh, oh, oh, oh

[Verse 1]
Like a spotlight the water hits me
Ran it extra cold to shake the words from my mouth
Though I know that no ones listening
I nervously rehearse for when youre around
And I keep waiting like you might change my mind

[Chorus]
Who wrote the book on goodbye?
There's never been a way to make this easy
When theres nothing quite wrong but it don't feel right
Either your head or your heart, you set the other on fire

[Verse 2]
Back and forth now I'm feelin' guilty
Cause I just cant stop this pendulum in my head
Though I know that our time is ending
Id rather lay forever right in this bed
And I keep waiting like, you might change my mind
Give me one more night

[Chorus]
Who wrote the book on goodbye?
There's never been a way to make this easy
When theres nothing quite wrong but it don't feel right
Either your head or your heart, you set the other on fire

[Pre-Chorus]
No one knows 
No one knows 

[Bridge]
We fell from the peak
And the stars, they broke their code
Im trying to forget
How I landed on this road
Im caught in between
What I wish and what I know
When they say that you just know

[Chorus]
Who wrote the book on goodbye?
There's never been a way to make this easy
When theres nothing quite wrong but it don't feel right
Either your head or your heart, you set the other on fire

[Pre-Chorus/Outro]
No one knows 
No one knows 
No one knows 
No, no, no, no

[Chorus]
Lately, I've been, I've been losing sleep
Dreaming about the things that we could be
But baby, I've been, I've been praying hard
Said no more counting dollars, we'll be counting stars
Yeah, we'll be counting stars

[Verse 1]
I see this life, like a swinging vine
Swing my heart across the line
And in my face is flashing signs
Seek it out and ye' shall find
Old, but I'm not that old
Young, but I'm not that bold
And I don't think the world is sold
On just doing what we're told

[Pre-Chorus]
I feel something so right doing the wrong thing
I feel something so wrong doing the right thing
I couldn't lie, couldn't lie, couldn't lie
Everything that kills me makes me feel alive

[Chorus]
Lately, I've been, I've been losing sleep
Dreaming about the things that we could be
But baby, I've been, I've been praying hard
Said no more counting dollars, we'll be counting stars
Lately, I've been, I've been losing sleep
Dreaming about the things that we could be
But baby, I've been, I've been praying hard
Said no more counting dollars, we'll be, we'll be counting stars

[Verse 2]
I feel the love and I feel it burn
Down this river, every turn
Hope is our four-letter word
Make that money, watch it burn
Old, but I'm not that old
Young, but I'm not that bold
And I don't think the world is sold
On just doing what we're told

[Pre-Chorus]
I feel something so wrong doing the right thing
I couldn't lie, couldn't lie, couldn't lie
Everything that drowns me makes me wanna fly

[Chorus]
Lately, I've been, I've been losing sleep
Dreaming about the things that we could be
But baby, I've been, I've been praying hard
Said no more counting dollars, we'll be counting stars
Lately, I've been, I've been losing sleep
Dreaming about the things that we could be
But baby, I've been, I've been praying hard
Said no more counting dollars, we'll be, we'll be counting stars

[Bridge]
Take that money, watch it burn
Sink in the river the lessons I learned
Take that money, watch it burn
Sink in the river the lessons I learned
Take that money, watch it burn
Sink in the river the lessons I learned
Take that money, watch it burn
Sink in the river the lessons I learned

[Interlude]
Everything that kills me makes me feel alive

[Chorus]
Lately, I've been, I've been losing sleep
Dreaming about the things that we could be
But baby, I've been, I've been praying hard
Said no more counting dollars, we'll be counting stars
Lately, I've been, I've been losing sleep
Dreaming about the things that we could be
But baby, I've been, I've been praying hard
Said no more counting dollars, we'll be, we'll be counting stars

[Outro]
Take that money, watch it burn
Sink in the river the lessons I've learned
Take that money, watch it burn
Sink in the river the lessons I've learned
Take that money, watch it burn
Sink in the river the lessons I've learned
Take that money, watch it burn
Sink in the river the lessons I've learned

[Verse 1]
Days when
We'd fight, we'd fight 'til I would give in
Yeah, perfect disasters
We were reaching, reaching for the rafters

[Pre-Chorus]
And on most of the days we were searching for ways
To get up and get out of the town that we were raised, yeah, Cause we were done
I remember, we were sleeping in cars
We were searching for OZ
We were burning cigars
With white plastics tips 'til we saw the sun
And we said crazy things like

[Chorus]
I refuse to look back thinking days were better
Just because they're younger days
I don't know what's 'round the corner
Way I feel right now I swear we'll never change
Back when we were kids
Swore we would never die
You and me were kids
Swear that well never die

[Verse 2]
Lights down
And we drive and we're drivin' just to get out
Yeah, perfect disasters
Yeah we were swinging, swinging from the rafters

[Pre-Chorus]
Hey, we were dancing in cars
We were looking for ours
We were naming the stars
After people we knew 'til we had to go
And we were saying things like

[Chorus]
I refuse to look back thinking days were better
Just because they're younger days
I don't know what's 'round the corner
Way I feel right now I swear we'll never change
Back when we were kids
Swore we would never die
You and me were kids
Swear that we'll never die

[Bridge]
Nights when we kept dancing
Changing all our plans and
Making every day a holiday
Feel the years start burning
City lights they're turning
Something 'bout this feels the same

[Chorus]
Back when we were kids
Swore we would never die
You and me were kids
Swear that we'll never die
I refuse to look back thinking days were better
Just because they're younger days
I don't know what's 'round the corner
Way I feel right now I swear well never change

You and me were kids

[Verse 1]
I need another story
Something to get off my chest
My life gets kinda boring
Need something that I can confess
'Til all my sleeves are stained red
From all the truth that I've said
Come by it honestly I swear
Thought you saw me wink, no
I've been on the brink, so

[Chorus]
So tell me what you want to hear
Something that will light those ears
I'm sick of all the insincere
So I'm gonna give all my secrets away
This time
Don't need another perfect lie
Don't care if critics ever jump in line
I'm gonna give all my secrets away

[Verse 2]
My God, amazing how we got this far
It's like we're chasing all those stars
Who's driving shiny big black cars
And every day I see the news
All the problems that we could solve
And when a situation rises
Just write it into an album
Send it straight to gold
But I don't really like my flow, no

[Chorus]
So tell me what you want to hear
Something that will light those ears
I'm sick of all the insincere
So I'm gonna give all my secrets away
This time
Don't need another perfect lie
Don't care if critics ever jump in line
I'm gonna give all my secrets away

[Bridge]
Ooh
Got no reason, got no shame
Got no family I can blame
Just don't let me disappear
I'ma tell you everything

[Chorus]
So tell me what you want to hear
Something that'll light those ears
I'm sick of all the insincere
So I'm gonna give all my secrets away
This time
Don't need another perfect lie
Don't care if critics ever jump in line
I'm gonna give all my secrets away
So tell me what you want to hear
Something that'll light those ears
I'm sick of all the insincere
So I'm gonna give all my secrets away
This time
Don't need another perfect lie
Don't care if critics ever jump in line
I'm gonna give all my secrets away

[Outro]
All my secrets away
All my secrets away

[Verse 1]
I'm holding on your rope, got me ten feet off the ground
And I'm hearing what you say, but I just can't make a sound
You tell me that you need me, then you go and cut me down
But wait
You tell me that you're sorry, didn't think I'd turn around
And say 

[Chorus]
It's too late to apologize, it's too late
I said it's too late to apologize, it's too late
Too late, oh, oh

[Verse 2]
I'd take another chance, take a fall, take a shot for you, oh, oh
I need you like a heart needs a beat, but it's nothing new
Yeah, yeah
I loved you with a fire red, now it's turning blue
And you say
Sorry like the angel Heaven let me think was you
But I'm afraid

[Chorus]
It's too late to apologize, it's too late
I said it's too late to apologize
It's too late, oh, oh
It's too late to apologize, it's too late
I said it's too late to apologize, it's too late
I said it's too late to apologize, yeah
I said it's too late to apologize, yeah

[Outro]
I'm holding on your rope, got me ten feet off the ground

[Chorus: Ryan Tedder]
Can't I just turn back the clock?
Forgive my sins
I just wanna roll my sleeves up
And start again
I know that I messed it up
Time and time again
I just wanna roll my sleeves up
And start again

[Verse 1: Ryan Tedder]
I was switchin' up the lanes
Steppin' out the frame I'm in
I was pulling on the reins
Sick of all the same happenin'
I swear I was looking for disaster
Mixed with a bottle of gin
And just because I come home after
Doesn't mean you'll take me in

[Pre-Chorus: Ryan Tedder]
You see my world is spinning like there's nothing below
You see my world is feeling like it just might explode
And yes I know it's hard to take it backwards from my mind
I need to get it right, need to see some light come in

[Chorus: Ryan Tedder]
Can't I just turn back the clock?
Forgive my sins
I just wanna roll my sleeves up
And start again
I know that I messed it up
Time and time again
I just wanna roll my sleeves up
And start again

[Verse 2: Logic]
Feelin' like maybe I'm unappreciated
Like my presence in your life has been alleviated
I feel like everything I've done before is different now
But I can see clearer than ever from a distance now
Every day I do it, I been goin' through it
But you never knew it 'cause I never showed you
You gave me the world, so I feel I owed you
I been lookin' through the mirror and that's the old you
I'ma get it right now, don't know how
But I promise that we're gonna make it somehow
I'm all in, it's from the heart again
Open up your mind and maybe we could start again

[Chorus: Ryan Tedder]
Can't I just turn back the clock?
Forgive my sins
I just wanna roll my sleeves up
And start again
I know that I messed it up
Time and time again
I just wanna roll my sleeves up
And start again

[Refrain: Ryan Tedder]
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh

[Outro: Ryan Tedder]
And yes I know it's hard to take it backwards from my mind
I need to get it right, need to see some light come in
Can't I just turn back the clock?
Forgive my sins
I just wanna roll my sleeves up
And start again

[Verse 1]
When, when we came home
Worn to the bones
I told myself, "this could get rough"
And when, when I was off, which happened a lot
You came to me and said, "that's enough"

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Oh, I know that this love is pain
But we can't cut it from out these veins, no

[Chorus 1]
So I'll hit the lights and you lock the doors
We ain't leaving this room 'til we both feel more
Don't walk away, don't roll your eyes
They say love is pain, well darling, let's hurt tonight
Ah-ooh-ooh, ah-ooh-ooh

[Verse 2]
When, when you came home
Worn to the bones
I told myself, "this could get rough"

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Oh, I know you're feeling insane
Tell me something that I can explain, oh

[Chorus 2]
I'll hit the lights and you lock the doors
Tell me all of the things that you couldn't before
Don't walk away, don't roll your eyes
They say love is pain, well darling, let's hurt tonight
If this love is pain, well darling, let's hurt, oh tonight
Ah-ooh-ooh, ah-ooh-ooh

[Outro]
So you hit the lights and I'll lock the doors
Let's say all of the things that we couldn't before
I won't walk away, won't roll my eyes
They say love is pain, well darling, let's hurt tonight
If this love is pain, then honey let's love tonight

[Verse 1]
Hope when you take that jump, you don't fear the fall
Hope when the water rises, you built a wall
Hope when the crowd screams out, it's screaming your name
Hope if everybody runs, you choose to stay
Hope that you fall in love and it hurts so bad
The only way you can know is give it all you have
And I hope that you don't suffer but take the pain
Hope when the moment comes, you'll say:

[Chorus]
I, I did it all
I, I did it all
I owned every second that this world could give
I saw so many places, the things that I did
With every broken bone I swear I lived

[Verse 2]
Hope that you spend your days but they all add up
And when that sun goes down hope you raise your cup
I wish that I could witness all your joy and all your pain
But until my moment comes, I'll say:

[Chorus]
I, I did it all
I, I did it all
I owned every second that this world could give
I saw so many places, the things that I did
With every broken bone I swear I lived

[Bridge]
 I swear I lived
 I swear I

[Chorus]
I, I did it all
I, I did it all
I owned every second that this world could give
I saw so many places, the things that I did
With every broken bone I swear I lived
I swear I lived

[Verse 1]
These days my waves get lost in the oceans
Seven billion swimmers, man I'm going through the motions
Sent up a flare, I need love and devotion
Traded for some faces that I never know, notion
Maybe I should try to find the old me
Take me to the places and the people that know me
Tryna just connect, thinking maybe you could show me
If there's so many people here, then why am I so lonely?

[Chorus 1]
Can I get a connection?
Can I get, can I get a connection?
Can I get a connection?
Can I get, can I get a connection?

[Verse 2]
Real friends, good friends  hard to find, let's face it
Buy the perfect home and there's a flood in the basement
Made a couple dollars now, and I ain't tryna chase it
Kids from Oklahoma, man, we don't waste it
I'm just tryna paint the picture for me
Something I could give a damn about in maybe 40
Years and I be ready and willing and able to edit the story
Cause there's so many people here to be so damn lonely

[Chorus 2]
Can I get a connection?
Can I get, can I get a connection?
Can I get a connection?
Can I get, can I get a connection?
I can see it in my, see it in my reflection
Oh, can I get a connection?
Can I get, can I get a connection?

[Refrain]
Lonely

[Bridge]
Right now, right now, I'm switching to a new lane
Foot to the floor, man searching for the real thing
Need somebody else, sometimes ain't no shame
Head to the clouds sayin'

[Chorus 3]
It's like can I get a connection?
Can I get, can I get a connection?
Can I get a connection?
Can I get, can I get a connection?
I can see it in my, see it in my reflection
Oh, can I get a connection?
Can I get, can I get a connection?

[Outro]
Uh
Tryna find the old me 
Yeah

[Chorus]
Would you rescue me? Would you get my back?
Would you take my call when I start to crack?
Would you rescue me? Ah, would you rescue me?
Would you rescue me when I'm by myself?
When I need your love? If I need your help?
Would you rescue me? Ah, would you rescue me?

[Verse 1]
We don't talk much, not anymore
Broken bottles and slammin' doors
But we still care about each other
Say we care about each other
I know life took us far away
But I still dream 'bout the good old days
When we took care of each other
We were livin' for each other

[Pre-Chorus]
But I start to wonder, wonder
If I'm slipping under, under 

[Chorus]
Would you rescue me? Would you get my back?
Would you take my call when I start to crack?
Would you rescue me? Ah, would you rescue me?
Would you rescue me when I'm by myself?
When I need your love, if I need your help
Would you rescue me? Ah, would you rescue me?
Would you rescue me? Would you get my back?
Would you take my call when I start to crack?
Would you rescue me? Ah
Would you rescue me? 
Would you rescue me when I'm by myself?
When I need your love, if I need your help
Would you rescue me? Ah, would you rescue me?

[Verse 2]
Yeah, I miss all the times we had
Can't forget what you can't get back
And you can't find it in another
Man, time, it ain't your lover
I don't care what you thought before
I'll be there anytime you call
Don't you ever call another
No need to call another

[Pre-Chorus]
And I start to wonder, wonder
If I'm slipping under, under 

[Chorus]
Would you rescue me? Would you get my back?
Would you take my call when I start to crack?
Would you rescue me? Ah
Would you rescue me? 
Would you rescue me when I'm by myself?
When I need your love, if I need your help
Would you rescue me? Ah, would you rescue me? 

[Bridge]
Would you rescue me?
Oh, rescue me 
Would you rescue me? 

Oh, rescue me


[Chorus]
Would you rescue me? Would you get my back?
Would you take my call when I start to crack?
Would you rescue me? Ah, would you rescue me?
Would you rescue me when I'm by myself?
When I need your love, if I need your help
Would you rescue me? Ah, would you rescue me?

[Verse 1]
I used to leave the doors unlocked and leave the lights on
I used to stay awake, just counting hours all night long
I had so many empty rooms inside this chateau
Yeah, oh yeah
I'm done with sharing space with people that I don't know
Trading pieces of my heart 'til I felt shallow
I had so many empty rooms inside this chateau, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
But ever since I met you
No vacancy because of you
There's no vacancy, no empty rooms
Got no vacancy, ever since I met you
No vacancy because of you

[Chorus]
Used to be that I felt so damn empty
Ever since I met you, no vacancy
Used to be that I felt so damn empty
Ever since I met you, no vacancy
No vacancy, no vacancy
Used to be that I felt so damn empty
Ever since I met you, no vacancy
Used to be that I felt so damn empty
Ever since I met you, no vacancy
No vacancy, no vacancy

[Verse 2]
I used to be the type to never take a chance, oh
Had so many walls, you'd think I was a castle
I spent so many empty nights with faces I don't know

[Pre-Chorus]
But ever since I met you
No vacancy because of you
There's no vacancy, no empty rooms
Got no vacancy ever since I met you
No vacancy 'cause of you

[Chorus]
Used to be that I felt so damn empty
Ever since I met you, no vacancy
Used to be that I felt so damn empty
Ever since I met you, no vacancy
No vacancy, no vacancy

[Bridge]
Come on, come on, listen, oh yeah
Come on, come on, listen, oh yeah
When I fell, I fell, I fell, I fell for you
So no vacancy, no vacancy

[Chorus]
Used to be that I felt so damn empty
Ever since I met you, no vacancy
Used to be that I felt so damn empty
Ever since I met you, no vacancy
No vacancy, no vacancy

[Outro]
Come on, come on, listen
No vacancy, oh yeah
Oh yeah, no vacancy

[Verse 1]
She said, "Every time I close my eyes I feel like I could disappear
I could overflow an ocean with the cavalcade of all my tears
And I know I sound dramatic, but that's just how it feels"
She said, "I'm holdin' to the notion that I'll find something real"

[Chorus]
Yeah, I just want to be wanted, oh
I could use a little love sometimes
I just need to be needed, oh
Like to know I'm crossin' someone's mind
I just want to be someone that somebody needs
I just want to be more than a drop in the sea
I just want to be

[Verse 2]
She said, "I'm countin' up my karma and I think it's time to cash it in 
So tired of livin' in a shadow of a mountain of what might've been 
And I know I sound dramatic, but that's just how it feels
I've been looking for somebody to tell me that I'm real"

[Chorus]
I just want to be wanted 
I could use a little love sometimes
I just need to be needed 
Like to know I'm crossin' someone's mind
I just want to be someone that somebody needs
I just want to be more than a drop in the sea

[Bridge]
I just want to be wanted
Oh yeah
We just want to be wanted
Ooh

[Outro]
I just want to be wanted
I could use a little love sometimes
I just need to be needed
Like to know I'm crossin' someone's mind

[Chorus]
I know I could lie but Im telling the truth
Wherever I go theres a shadow of you
I know I could try looking for something new
But wherever I go, I'll be looking for you

[Verse 1]
Some people lie but they're looking for magic
Others are quietly going insane
I feel alive when Im close to the madness
No easy love could ever make me feel the same

[Chorus 2]
I know I could lie, but I won't lie to you
Wherever I go, you're the ghost in the room
I don't even try looking for something new
Cause wherever I go, I'll be looking for you

[Verse 2]
Some people try but they can't find the magic
Others get down on their knees and they pray
I come alive when Im close to the madness
No easy love could ever make me feel the same
Make me feel the same
Make me feel the same, same, same

[Chorus]
I know I could lie but Im telling the truth
Wherever I go theres a shadow of you
I know I could try looking for something new
But wherever I go, I'll be looking for you
Wherever I go, I'll be looking for you, you

[Bridge]
Some people pray to their god for some magic
Cause no easy love could ever make them feel the same
No easy love could ever make me feel the same
Make me feel the same, same, same

[Chorus]
I know I could lie but Im telling the truth
Wherever I go theres a shadow of you
I know I could try looking for something new
But wherever I go, I'll be looking for you

[Outro]
You think it's a lie when I'm telling the truth
Wherever I go, I'll be looking for you
Wherever I go, I'll be looking for you
Looking for you, looking for you, ah

[Verse 1]
I'll be your light, your match, your burning sun
I'll be the bright, in black, that's making you run
And we'll feel alright, and we'll feel alright
'Cause we'll work it out, yeah, we'll work it out
I'll be doing this, if you had a doubt
'Til the love runs out, 'til the love runs out

[Verse 2]
I'll be your ghost, your game, your stadium
I'll be your fifty-thousand clapping like one
And I feel alright, and I feel alright
'Cause I worked it out, yeah, I worked it out
I'll be doin' this, if you had a doubt
'Til the love runs out, 'til the love runs out

[Chorus]
I got my mind made up
Man, I can't let go
I'm killing every second 'til it saves my soul
I'll be running, I'll be running
'Til the love runs out
'Til the love runs out
And we'll start a fire, and we'll shut it down
'Til the love runs out
'Til the love runs out

[Verse 3]
There's a maniac out in front of me
Got an angel on my shoulder, and Mephistopheles
But Mama raised me good, Mama raised me right
Mama said, "Do what you want, say prayers at night"
And I'm saying them, 'cause I'm so devout
'Til the love runs out
'Til the love runs out, yeah

[Chorus]
I got my mind made up
Man, I can't let go
I'm killing every second 'til it saves my soul
 I'll be running
 I'll be running
'Til the love runs out
'Til the love runs out
And we'll start a fire, and we'll shut it down
'Til the love runs out
'Til the love runs out

[Bridge]
Ooh, we all want the same thing
Ooh, we all run for something
Run for God, for fate
For love, for hate
For gold, for rust
For diamonds, for dust
I'll be your light, your match, your burning sun
I'll be the bright in black that's making you run

[Chorus]
I got my mind made up
Man, I can't let go
I'm killing every second 'til it saves my soul
 I'll be running
 I'll be running
'Til the love runs out
'Til the love runs out
And we'll start a fire, and we'll shut it down
'Til the love runs out
'Til the love runs out

[Verse 1 - Outro Variation]
I'll be your light, your match, your burning sun
I'll be the bright, in black that's making you run
And we'll feel alright, and we'll feel alright
'Cause we'll work it out, yes, we'll work it out
And we'll start a fire, and we'll shut it down
'Til the love runs out
'Til the love runs out
'Til the love runs out

[Verse 1]
Woke up in London yesterday
Found myself in the city near Piccadilly
Don't really know how I got here
I got some pictures on my phone
New names and numbers that I don't know
Address to places like Abbey Road
Day turns to night, night turns to whatever we want
We're young enough to say

[Chorus]
Oh, this has gotta be the good life
This has gotta be the good life
This could really be a good life, good life
Say oh, got this feeling that you can't fight
Like this city is on fire tonight
This could really be a good life
A good, good life

[Verse 2]
To my friends in New York, I say hello
My friends in L.A., they don't know
Where I've been for the past few years or so
Paris to China to Colorado
Sometimes there's airplanes I can't jump out
Sometimes there's bullshit that don't work now
We all got our stories, but please tell me-e-e-e
What there's to complain about

[Pre-Chorus]
When you're happy like a fool
Let it take you over
When everything is out
You got to take it in

[Chorus]
Oh, this has gotta be the good life
This has gotta be the good life
This could really be a good life, good life
Say oh, got this feeling that you can't fight
Like this city is on fire tonight
This could really be a good life
A good, good life
Oh, a good, good life
Yeah
Oh, oh

[Bridge]
Hopelessly, I feel like there might be something that I'll miss
Hopelessly, I feel like the window closes oh so quick
Hopelessly, I'm taking a mental picture of you now
'Cause hopelessly, the hope is we have
So much to feel good about

[Chorus]
Oh, this has gotta be the good life
This has gotta be the good life
This could really be a good life, good life
Say oh, got this feeling that you can't fight
Like this city is on fire tonight
This could really be a good life
A good, good life

[Outro]
Oh, yeah
Good, good life
Good life
Ooh, ooh
Oh
Listen, to my friends in New York, I say hello
My friends in L.A., they don't know
Where I've been for the past few years or so
Paris to China to Colorado
Sometimes there's airplanes I can't jump out
Sometimes there's bullshit that don't work now
We all got our stories, but please tell me-e-e-e
What there's to complain about

[Verse 1]
I stared up at the sun
Thought of all of the people, places and things Ive loved
I stared up just to see
With all of the faces, you were the one next to me

[Pre Chorus]
You can feel the light start to tremble
Washing what you know out to sea
You can see your life out of the window tonight

[Chorus]
If I lose myself tonight
Itll be by your side
I lose myself tonight...
 yeah, yeah, yeah
If I lose myself tonight
Itll be you and I
Lose myself tonight...

[Instrumental]

[Verse 2]
I woke up with the sun
Thought of all the people, places and things Ive loved
I woke up just to see
With all of the faces, you were the one next to me

[Pre Chorus]
You can feel the light start to tremble
Washing what you know out to sea
You can see your life out of the window tonight

[Chorus]
If I lose myself tonight
Itll be by your side
I lose myself tonight...
 yeah, yeah, yeah
If I lose myself tonight
Itll be you and I
Lose myself tonight...

[Instrumental]

[Outro]
Take us down and we keep trying
Forty thousand feet, keep flying
Take us down and we keep trying
Forty thousand feet, keep flying
Take us down and we keep trying
Forty thousand feet, keep flying
Take us down and we keep trying
Forty thousand feet, keep flying

If I lose myself tonight...

[Intro]
Didn't I, didn't I, didn't I love you?
Didn't we, didn't we, didn't we fly?
Know thatI,know that Istill care for you
But didn't we,didn't we say goodbye?

[Verse 1]
Swear that I saw your face
At a coffee shop on 8th
Or maybe it was in my mind?
And I swear that I heard your laugh
From a person that walked past me
At a party the other night

[Pre-Chorus]
Never thought we'd ever have to go without
Take you over anybody else, hands down
We're the type of melody that don't fade out
Don't fade out, can't fade out

[Chorus]
Didn't I, didn't I, didn't I love you?
Didn't we, didn't we, didn't we fly?
Know that I, know that I still care for you
But didn't we, didn't we say goodbye?
Didn't I, didn't I, didn't I love you?
Didn't we, didn't we, didn't we try?
Know that I, know that I still care for you
Tell me why good things have to die

[Verse 2]
Do you remember all those plans
That we made after too many drinks
In the kitchen of your brother's apartment?
When life was like a wishin' well
4:00 AM and raisin' hell
Damn, I knew you oh-so well

[Pre-Chorus]
Never thought we'd ever have to go without
Take you over anybody else, hands down
We're the type of melody that don't fade out
Don't fade out, can't fade out

[Chorus]
Didn't I, didn't I, didn't I love you?
Didn't we, didn't we, didn't we fly?
Know that I, know that I still care for you
But didn't we, didn't we say goodbye?
Didn't I, didn't I, didn't I love you?
Didn't we, didn't we, didn't we try?
Know that I, know that I still care for you
Tell me why good things have to die

[Bridge]
We had our moments, didn't we? 
So much that we will never be 

[Chorus]
Didn't I, didn't I, didn't I love you?
Didn't we, didn't we, didn't we fly?
Know that I, know that I still care for you
But didn't we, didn't we say goodbye?
Didn't I, didn't I, didn't I love you?
Didn't we, didn't we, didn't we try? 
Know that I, know that I still care for you 
Tell me why good things have to die 

[Verse 1: OneRepublic]
I had a dream the other night
About how we only get one life
It woke me up right after two
I stayed awake and stared at you
So I wouldnt lose my mind
And I had the week that came from hell
And yes I know that you could tell
But youre like the net under the ledge
When I go flying off the edge
You go flying off as well

[Pre Chorus: OneRepublic]
And if you only die once
I wanna die with

[Chorus: OneRepublic]
You got something I need
In this world full of people theres one killing me
And if we only die once I wanna die with you
You got something I need
In this world full of people theres one killing me
And if we only die once I wanna die with you

[Verse 2: OneRepublic]
Last night I think I drank too much
Yeah, call it our temporary crutch
With broken words I tried to say
Honey dont you be afraid
If we got nothing, we got us

[Pre Chorus: OneRepublic]
And if you only die once
I wanna die with

[Chorus: OneRepublic]
You got something I need
In this world full of people theres one killing me
And if we only die once I wanna die with you

[Bridge: OneRepublic]
I know that were not the same
But I'm so damn glad that we made it to this time
This time now

[Chorus: OneRepublic]
You got something I need
In this world full of people theres one killing me
And if we only die once I wanna die with you

[Chorus 1]
All the right friends in all the right places
So yeah, we're going down
They've got
All the right moves and all the right faces
So yeah, we're going down

[Verse 1]
Let's paint the picture of the perfect place
They've got it better than when anyone's told you
They'll be the King of Hearts, and you're the Queen of Spades
Then we'll fight for you like we were your soldiers
I know we got it good, but they got it made
And their grass is getting greener each day
I know things are looking up, but soon they'll take us down
Before anybody's knowing our name
They've got

[Chorus 1]
All the right friends in all the right places
So yeah, we're going down
They've got
All the right moves and all the right faces
So yeah, we're going down

[Chorus 2]
They say
Everybody knows, everybody knows where we're going
Yeah, we're going down
They say
Everybody knows, everybody knows where we're going
Yeah, we're going down

[Verse 2]
Do you think I'm special?
Do you think I'm nice?
Am I bright enough to shine in your spaces?
Between the noise you hear
And the sounds you like
Are we just sinking in the ocean of faces?
It can't be possible, that rain can fall
Only when it's over our heads
The sun is shining everyday, but it's far away
Over the world that's dead
They've got, they've got

[Chorus 1]
All the right friends in all the right places
So yeah, we're going down
They've got
All the right moves and all the right faces
So yeah, we're going down

[Chorus 2]
They say
Everybody knows, everybody knows where we're going
Yeah, we're going down
They say
Everybody knows, everybody knows where we're going
Yeah, we're going down

[Bridge]
It don't matter what you see
I know I could never be
Someone that'll look like you
It don't matter what you say
I know I could never fake
Someone that could sound like you

[Chorus 1]
All the right friends in all the right places
So yeah, we're going down
They've got
All the right moves and all the right faces
So yeah, we're going down
All the right friends in all the right places
So yeah, we're going down
They've got
All the right moves and all the right faces
So yeah, we're going down

[Chorus 2]
They say
Everybody knows, everybody knows where we're going
Yeah, we're going down
They say
Everybody knows, everybody knows where we're going
Yeah, we're going down

[Outro]
Yeah, we're going down
Yeah, we're going down
All the right moves, hey
Yeah, we're going down
All the right moves, hey
Yeah, we're going down

[Verse 1]
This town is colder now, I think it's sick of us
It's time to make our move, I'm shaking off the rust
I've got my heart set on anywhere but here
I'm staring down myself, counting up the years
Steady hands just take the wheel
And every glance is killing me
Time to make one last appeal for the life I lead

[Chorus]
Stop and stare
I think I'm moving, but I go nowhere
Yeah, I know that everyone gets scared
But I've become what I can't be, oh
Stop and stare
You start to wonder why you're here not there
And you'd give anything to get what's fair
But fair ain't what you really need
Oh, can you see what I see?

[Verse 2]
They're trying to come back, all my senses push
Untie the weight bags, I never thought I could
Steady feet, don't fail me now
I'm gonna run 'til you can't walk
Something pulls my focus out
And I'm standing down

[Chorus]
Stop and stare
I think I'm moving, but I go nowhere
Yeah, I know that everyone gets scared
But I've become what I can't be, oh
Stop and stare
You start to wonder why you're here not there
And you'd give anything to get what's fair
But fair ain't what you really need
Oh, you don't need

[Outro]
Stop and stare
I think I'm moving, but I go nowhere
Yeah, I know that everyone gets scared
I've become what I can't be
Oh, do you see what I see?

[Verse 1]
Never could imagine the way the story happened
You with someone new
I used to be yourfocus,now you don'teven notice
When I leave the room

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Youweren't even tryin' to make me jealous
But you can't help it, you can't help it

[Chorus]
And it kills me to know that you found
Somebody to love, somebody to love
Tell me how can I go on without
Somebody to love, somebody to love
Somebody to love
Somebody to love
Somebody to

[Verse 2]
They say that love comes easy
Whenever it comes easy and I see it on your face
I don't want you to be lonely
But right now, I'm the only one who feels this way

[Pre-Chorus 2]
And I ain't even tryin' to make you miss me, make you miss me
I know we're history

[Chorus]
But it kills me to know that you found
Somebody to love, somebody to love
Tell me how can I go on without
Somebody to love, somebody to love
Somebody to love
Somebody to love

[Interlude]
Somebody to

Somebody to


[Pre-Chorus 1]
You weren't even tryin' to make me jealous
But you can't help it, you can't help it

[Chorus]
And it kills me to know that you found
Somebody to love, somebody to love
Tell me how can I go on without
Somebody to love, somebody to love
Somebody to love
Somebody to love

[Outro]
I used to be your focus, now you don't even notice
When I leave the room

[Chorus]
Oh, I know that there'll be better days
Oh, that sunshine 'bout to come my way
Maywenever ever shedanother tear for today
'Cause oh, Iknow that there'll be better days

[Verse 1]
Waking up in California
But theseclouds,theywon't go away
Everyday is likeanother storm, yeah
I'm just trying not to go insane
Yeah, and the city's shining so bright
So many dark nights, so many dark days
But any time I feel the paranoia
I close my eyes and I pray

[Chorus]
Oh, I know that there'll be better days
Oh, that sunshine 'bout to come my way
May we never ever shed another tear for today
'Cause oh, I know that there'll be better days

[Verse 2]
Been waking up to a new year
Got the past million miles away
I been waking up with a new fear 
But I know it'll wash away
Whatever you do, don't worry 'bout me
I'm thinking 'bout you, don't worry 'bout us
'Cause in the morning everything can change, yeah
And time will tell you it does

[Chorus]
Oh, I know that there'll be better days
Oh, that sunshine 'bout to come my way
May we never ever shed another tear for today
'Cause oh, I know that there'll be better days

[Bridge]
Better days 
Better days 
May we never ever shed another tear for today
'Cause oh, I know that there'll be better days

[Outro]
May we never ever shed another tear for today
'Cause oh, I know that there'll be better days

[Verse 1]
Woke up starin' at this
Starin' at this empty room
Looked at
Thousand different pictures that your mother took of you
You see I had this crazy dream last night
This man, he talked to me
He told me
Everything that's good and bad about my history

[Chorus]
But he said that you are
You are the future
He said that you are
You are the future
And the future looks good
The future looks good

[Verse 2]
Oh call me any time that
Every time you're losin' it
And tell me
Anyone and everyone who makes you feel like shit
Because you know
Anybody, everybody else can lie
But honey I won't
See you with a, see you with a broken set of eyes

[Chorus]
I swear that you are
You are the future
I swear that you are, you are
The future
And the future looks good
Oh, yeah
The future looks good
Oh, yeah

The future looks good
Oh, yeah
The future looks good
Oh, yeah
You, you
You
You, you
You

[Outro]
Woke up starin' at this
Starin' at this empty room
Looked at
Thousand different pictures that your mother took of you

[Verse 1]
I dont set alarms
Lately I dont set alarms
But thats because of the ringing thats happening inside my head
Inside my head
Yeah yeah
It keeps me safe from harm
At least I tell myself Im safe from harm
But really its probably filling my dreams with dread
So I get out of bed
Yeah yeah
Yes Im neurotic Im obsessed and I know it
I cant take vacations in the brain
Oh believe me Id be on one
Hawaii under warm sun
Yeah yeah

[Chorus]
I think I lost my mind
But dont worry about me
Happens all the time
In the morning Ill be better
In the morning Ill be better
Sing it again
I think I lost my mind
But dont worry about me
Happens all the time
In the morning Ill be better
Things are only getting better
Sing it again

[Verse 2]
I tell myself Ill change
Thats right I tell myself Ill change
But then I begin to realize that the problems inside my veins
But its inside my veins 
Yeah yeah
I swear I'm not insane
Yes most likely not insane
Everybody goes through moments of losing their clarity
At least Im never boring
But I've been losing sleep
So call the doctor said, "Take one of these
And call me in the morning"

[Chorus]
I think I lost my mind
But dont worry about me
Happens all the time
In the morning Ill be better
In the morning Ill be better
Sing it again
I think I lost my mind
But dont worry about me
Happens all the time
In the morning Ill be better
Things are only getting better
Sing it again
Sing it again

[Bridge]
So heres the question asked
Of all the things you love the people places from the future to your ancient past
Of every one of those, which one will cause you to let it go, let it go?
Need to crash

[Chorus]
Think you lost your mind
Well don't worry about it
Happens all the time
In the morning youll be better
Things are only getting better
Sing it again
I think I lost my mind
But dont worry about me
Happens all the time
In the morning Ill be better
In the morning Ill be better
Sing it again
I think I lost my mind
But dont worry about me

Happens all the time
In the morning Ill be better

Things are slowly getting better
Sing it again

[Verse 1: Ryan Tedder]
I used to leave the doors unlocked and leave the lights on
I used to stay awake, just counting hours all night long
I had so many empty rooms inside this chateau
Yeah, oh yeah

J'ai voulu partager mon espace et mon ego

[Verse 1]
Yesterday I talked to God, we had a conversation
Told him that Im sorry I lost communication
But I just, I just needed some holiness
I said that the things that Ive been trying end up in frustration
Life aint what it seems in any situation
Then he said, he said the strangest thing

[Chorus]
He said, "How does it feel to be human
Does some of the best plans you make get ruined?
Do people curse you when flowers aint blooming?
How does it feel?"
He said, "How does it feel to be human?
If I could for one day I just might do it
Dance 'til the sun comes up to my music
How does it feel?
Hows it feel?"

[Verse 2]
Yesterday I talked to God, we had a conversation
I asked him why this life is a crazy combination
Of numbers, numbers, numbers we cant read
Yeah for sure I got some friends but we got complications
Most of us are happy with some medication
But I could, I could really use some wings

[Chorus]
He said, "How does it feel to be human
Does some of the best plans you make get ruined?
Do people curse you when flowers aint blooming?
How does it feel?"
He said, "How does it feel to be human?
If I could for one day I just might do it
Dance 'til the sun comes up to my music
How does it feel?
Hows it feel?"
"How does it feel to be human?
If I could for one day I just might do it
Dance 'til the sun comes up to my music
How does it feel?
Hows it feel?"

How does it feel to be human
"How does it feel to be human?
If I could for one day I just might do it
Dance 'til the sun comes up to my music
How does it feel?
Hows it feel?"

[Verse 1]
When I was a kid I used to buy and sell gravity
I knew how to fly, and I would teach you for a fee
Broke every window in my hotel heart
When I was only five years old but twelve years scarred
And I'd hear the same voice echo in my mind
It'd say, "Son, you've got an angel."
That'd chase the devil at night

[Chorus]
When I was a kid my grandfather was a preacher
He'd talk about God, he was something like a teacher
He said, "God only helps those who learn to help themselves"
He was a million miles from a million dollars
But you could never spend his wealth

[Verse 2]
I took a little faith, and put it in a parking lot
I drove to a strange town full of "have" and "have nones"
And as I walked through that story-book life
I've been looking for an angel who'd chase the devil at night

[Chorus 2]
When I was a kid my grandfather was a preacher
Hed talk about love, he was something like a teacher
He said, God only helps those who learn to help themselves
He was a million miles from a million dollars
But you could never spend his wealth

[Bridge]
Wave, put your hands up and hands down
Wave, put your hands up and hands down
Wave, put your hands up and hands down

[Chorus 3]
When I was a kid my grandfather was a preacher
Hed talk about life, he was something like a teacher
He said, God only helps those who learn to help themselves
He was a million miles from a million dollars
But you could never spend his wealth

[Outro]
He was a million miles from a million dollars
But you could never spend his wealth

[Verse 1]
Well I see breakfast on the table
And I can smell you in the halls
Lord knows Id cry if I was able
But that wont get me through tomorrow
And no its not like I was counting
Or thought that wed run out of days
So Ill be holding onto something
Breathing the air you took away

[Chorus]
I, Ill keep a picture of you on the wall, of you on the wall
And choke on the memories
Ill keep a message of you if you call, of you if you call
And choke on the memories
Choke, choke, yeah
Choke, choke

[Verse 2]
Well Ive been looking for some new words
To say just how you got to me
I wrote some letters that I might burn
Cause then youre not just history
And I see your clothes in the closet
I hear your phone ring in the drawer
Im not hoping for an answer
Im just knocking at your door, oh

[Chorus]
I keep a picture of you on the wall, of you on the wall
And choke on the memories
Ill keep a message of you if you call, of you if you call
Choke, choke, yeah
Choke, choke, yeah
Ill keep a picture of you on the wall, of you on the wall
And choke on the memories
Ill keep the message of you if you call, of you if you call
Choke, choke, yeah
Choke, choke, yeah

[Outro]
Well I see breakfast on the table
And I can smell you in the halls

[Verse 1: Ryan Tedder]
'Member when we met?
We fell in love on a Sunday
Yeah I'll never forget
The way that you spelled my name
It took me a year
To find a new attraction
My hope and my fear
Is human interaction

[Chorus: Ryan Tedder]
Yeah I just want my love automatic
If artificial love makes sense
I just want your love, I'm an addict
Artificial intelligence

[Breakdown: Ryan Tedder]
Artificial
Artificial

[Verse 2: Peter Gabriel]
Remember when we met?
I got obsessed on a Monday
And I'll never forget
I felt such a cliche
I'm wanting to be there
Dreaming of your soft skin
With no emotion
You can really make my head spin

[Chorus: Ryan Tedder + Peter Gabriel]
Yeah I just want my love automatic
If artificial love makes sense
I just want your love, I'm an addict
Artificial intelligence
Yeah I just want my love automatic
If artificial love makes sense
I just want your love, I'm an addict
Artificial intelligence

[Breakdown: Ryan Tedder]
Artificial
Artificial

[Chorus: Ryan Tedder]
I just want my love automatic
If artificial love makes sense
I just want your love, I'm an addict
Artificial intelligence

[Breakdown]

[Outro: Peter Gabriel]
It's all too real
Love the way you love me
Artificial intelligence
Way you love me
Love the way you love me
It's so clear
You make everything inside me feel
Just automatic hurt
Bring me back tonight
Cause you're intelligent, so real
So real

[Verse 1]
You and I were meant to be
Ain't no doubt about it
No way to hide that sort of thing
Now Im waiting for something better
Aint nothing better worth imagining

[Pre-Chorus]
I, I keep on running
Im building bridges that I know you never wanted
Look for my heart
You stole it away
Now Ill never sing the road that I could take

[Chorus]
Listen, I
Want you to burn my bridges down, down
I said I
Want you to burn my bridges down, down, down
Set me on fire
You set me
Set me on fire
You can burn my bridges down

[Verse 2]
Send this out to sea
You send it where you wanted
You can take your no for no or not at all
Theres no filling up your spaces with fictionary places
Imaginary faces they dont work at all

[Pre-Chorus]
I, I keep on running
Im building bridges that I know you never wanted
Look for my heart
You stole it away
Now Ill never sing the road that I could take

[Chorus]
Listen, I
Want you to burn my bridges down, down
I said I
Want you to burn my bridges down, down, down
Set me on fire
You set me
Set me on fire
Yeah you burn my bridges down

[Outro]
I want you to burn my bridges down, down
I want you to burn my bridges down
Set me on fire
You set me
Set me on fire, set me on fire
Set me on fire
I want you to burn my bridges down 
I said, I want you to burn my bridges down, down, down
Set me on fire, set me on fire

[Verse 1]
It's been a long time coming since I've seen your face
I've been everywhere and back trying to replace
Everything that I had 'til my feet went numb
Prayin' like a fool that's been on the run
Heart's still beating, but it's not working
It's like a million-dollar phone that you just can't ring
I reached out trying to love, but I feel nothing
Yeah, my heart is numb

[Pre-Chorus]
But with you I feel again
With you I can feel again

[Chorus]
I'm feeling better ever since you know me
I was a lonely soul, but that's the old me

[Verse 2]
A long time coming since I've seen your face
I've been everywhere and back trying to replace
Everything that I broke 'til my feet went numb
Praying like a fool who just shot a gun
Heart still beating, but it's not working
It's like a hundred thousand voices that just can't sing
I reached out trying to love, but I feel nothing
Oh, my heart is numb

[Pre-Chorus]
But with you I feel again
With you I can feel again

[Bridge]
But with you 
I feel again 
With you 
I can feel again 

[Chorus]
I'm feeling better ever since you know me
I was a lonely soul, but that's the old me
I'm feeling better ever since you know me
I was a lonely soul, but that's the old me
I'm feeling better ever since you know me
I was a lonely soul, but that's the old me

[Outro]
I'm feeling better ever since you know me
I was a lonely soul, but that's the old me
A little wiser now from what you've shown me
I feel again, feel again[Refrain: One Republic]
I'm holdin' on a rope
Got me ten feet off the ground
And I'm hearin' what you're saying
But I just can't make a sound
You tell me that you need me
Then you go and cut me down, but wait
Tell me that you're sorry
Didn't think I'd turn around, I say hey

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
Okay, I'm talking 'bout a good girl gone bad
Crooked world, wrong path; right Mom, wrong Dad
I sing this song mad but not mad enough to shoot you
But it just eats me up, like some barbecue from Luther's
In the morning with the roosters
On the corner with the boosters
And she's the fresh-cut and they're on her, like sutures
And I wanna talk to her, but her momma has to school her
I wanna see her better, she's the weather of my future
I don't wanna see another hurricane
Baby, you can kill the pain
If you just let me explain, trust me, I know what I'm sayin'
You will end up on the track of an on-comin' train
Stuck in the passenger seat, travelin' through the fast lane

[Verse 2: Bun B]
Well, once upon a time there was a mom and a dad
Who on the outside, had everything people wished they had
A beautiful daughter, two-story house, two-car garage
And a white picket-fence wrapped around the front yard
See, Daddy was a doctor and Mommy was a banker
Mommy's job got outsourced, so now Mommy's a dranker
Daddy had a malpractice suit, now he's a snorter
And all this shit is takin' place right in front of the daughter
She says, "Daddy, what's wrong?", but he's just too high
"Mommy, what we gon' do?", she just get drunk and cry
Caught in the middle of two wrongs, tryin' to do right
Looking for answers all alone in the darkness of night
Shit ain't right

[Refrain: One Republic]
I'm holding on a rope
Got me ten feet off the ground
And I'm hearing what you're saying
But I just can't make a sound
You tell me that you need me
Then you go and cut me down, but wait
Tell me that you're sorry
Didn't think I'd turn around, I say hey

[Hook: One Republic]
You say that it's too late to apologize
It's too late
I said it's too late to apologize
It's too late

[Verse 1]
I could tell you I was fragile
I could tell you I was weak
I could write you out a letter
Tell you anything you need
I've seen minutes turn to hours
Hours turn to years
And I've seen truth turn to power

[Chorus]
If you could see me the way I see you
If you could feel me the way I feel you
You'd be a believer
You'd be a believer

[Post-Chorus]
Minutes turn to hours
Hours turn to years
And I've seen truth turn to power

[Verse 2]
I could tell you I was ageless
But I know you see the light
I could tell you I'm immune to everything
But that's a lie
Dust don't turn to flowers
Skies don't disappear
But I've seen truth turn to power

[Chorus]
Oh, if you could see me the way I see you
If you could feel me the way I feel you
You'd be a believer 
You'd be a believer 
You'd be a believer 
You'd be a believer 

[Bridge]
Hard to keep goin' on 
I said it's hard to keep goin' on 
It's hard to keep goin' on 

[Chorus]
If you could see me the way I see you
If you could feel me the way I feel you
You'd be a believer
You'd be a believer
You'd be a believer
Be a believer
Be a believer 
You'd be 

[Post-Chorus]
Minutes turn to hours
Hours turn to years
And I've seen truth turn to powerWe were running from the waves on the shallows
Trying to keep ourselves alone and out of sight
All right, all right, all right
You were talking about the night when I cashed out
Traded glances as I stole your lovers light
All right, all right, all right
Thats how I recall it and you were like

I remember it, it was a night just like this
One of those moments that just slip
But you just feel it from your heart to your fingertips, yeah
And I remember it, it was a late summer bliss
One of those moments that just slip
But you feel it from your heart to your fingertips, yeah

And I remember you, you were first on my list
One of those moments that just slip
But you feel it from your heart to your fingertips, yeah
I remember us, you were a late summer bliss
One of those moments that just slips
But you feel it from your heart to your fingertips, yeah

We were drinking from the same old glasses
That we borrowed from my roommate down the hall, hall, hall
Down the hall and you were like
I remember it, it was a night just like this
One of those moments that just slip
But you feel it from your heart to your fingertips, yeah
And I remember it, it was a late summer bliss
One of those moments that just slip
But you feel it from your heart to your fingertips, yeah

[Verse 1]
Hello, world
Hope you're listening
Forgive me if Im young
For speaking out of turn
Theres someone I've been missing
I think that they could be
The better half of me
Theyre in the wrong place tryin' to make it right
But Im tired of justifying
So I say to you

[Chorus]
Come home, come home
'Cause I've been waiting for you
For so long, for so long
And right now, there's a war between the vanities
But all I see is you and me
And the fight for you is all I've ever known
So come home
Ooh

[Verse 2]
I get lost in the beauty
Of everything I see
The world ain't half as bad
As they paint it to be
If all the sons, all the daughters
Stopped to take it in
Well, hopefully, the hate subsides
And the love can begin
It might start now, yeah
Well, maybe Im just dreaming out loud
Until then

[Chorus]
Come home, come home
'Cause I've been waiting for you
For so long, for so long
And right now, there's a war between the vanities
But all I see is you and me
And the fight for you is all I've ever known, ever known
So come home
Ooh

[Bridge]
Everything I cant be
Is everything you should be
And thats why I need you here
Everything I cant be
Is everything you should be
And thats why I need you here
So hear this now

[Chorus]
Come home, come home
'Cause I've been waiting for you
For so long, for so long
And right now, there's a war between the vanities
But all I see is you and me
And the fight for you is all I've ever known, ever known
So come home
Ooh

[Outro]
Come home, come home

Today I'm not myself
And you, you're someone else
And all these rules don't fit
And all that starts can quit
What a peculiar state we're in
What a peculiar state we're in

[Bridge]
Let's play a game where all of the lives we lead can change
Let's play a game where nothing that we can see, the same

[Chorus]
But we'll find other pieces to the puzzles
Slipping out under the locks
I could show you how many moves to checkmate, right now
We could take apart this life we're building and pack it up inside a box
All that really matters is we're doing it right now, right now

[Instrumental Bridge]

[Chorus]
But we'll find other pieces to the puzzles
Slipping out under the locks
I could show you how many moves to checkmate, right now
We could take apart this life we're building and pack it up inside a box
All that really matters is we're doing it right now, right now

Yeah, oh yeah
T me miraste y me llevaste hasta tus brazos
Mi corazn antes de ti estaba en pedazos
Prometo que es por siempre y seguir tus pasos

No vacancy , because of you
There's no vacancy , no empty rooms
Got no vacancy , ever since I met you
No vacancy , because of you

Djame decirte que soy sincero
Djame decirte que yo te quiero
Corazn de fuego encendi la llama
Te am de la nada, te am de la nada
No hay otra mujer en el mundo entero
Que me va a querer como yo te quiero
Se acab el espacio que haba en mi cama
Te am de la nada, te am de la nada
Y dice...
No s si puedo volver a encontrarte otra vez
Y volver a ilusionarme otra vez
Me enseaste a enamorarme otra vez
No s si puedo volver a encontrarte otra vez
Y volver a ilusionarme otra vez

[Verse 2]
Lost in stars since she was a girl
She dreamt of a place of a better world
It felt like sunlight
Tired of the days living in the dark
She ran to the place where the wild things are
It felt right
Cause it felt right

[Pre-Chorus]
She said here is where Ill be living until my times up, yeah
Found my people now Im made up
Always dark before the dawn
Always dark before the dawn

[Chorus]

So just one more time before the morning comes
Oh everybody feels the love
If theyre throwing stones at the two of us, two of us

[Chorus]
Everyone, they say that we dont work
But I could swear this is heaven yeah
Everyday I know that this might hurt but I dont care
This is heaven yeah

[Verse 1]
I think its time that I told you
Im a fan of your universe
And every shade that you offer
Its different but I know it works
Im addicted to the magic
And the glow of the city lights
I felt it in my veins just didnt know how to say it right

[Pre-Chorus]
She said, "Do you see me in black and white?
Do you need me every day and night?"
I said, "I dont wanna dance with another
We could feel this darkness with each other"

[Chorus]
Cause when I look at you I see colors
When I look at you I see colors

[Verse 2]
Everyones got their own light
Some shine and they fade away
Everyones got a story
Those change every single day

[Pre-Chorus]
She said, Do you see me in shades of grey?
Do you need me like I need you that way?
I say, I dont wanna lay with another
We could feel this quiet with each other

[Chorus]
Cause when I look at you I see colors
When I look at you I see colors
I see woo colors
I see woo colors

[Bridge]
Every time I look at you lately
I see colors theyre changing
Every time I look at you lately
I see colors
I see you in black and white
I see you in the brightest light

[Chorus]
Yeah when I look at you colors
When I look at you I see colors
When I look at you I see woo colors

[Verse 1]
Some girls feel best in their tiny dresses
Some girls, nothing but sweatpants, looking like a princess
Some girls kiss new lips every single night
They're staying out late 'cause they just celebrating life

[Pre-Chorus]
You know some days you feel so good in your own skin
But it's okay if you wanna change the body that you came in
'Cause you look greatest when you feel like a damn queen
We're all just playing a game in a way, trying to win at life

[Chorus]
Most girls are smart and strong and beautiful
Most girls work hard, go far, we are unstoppable
"Most girls": Our fight to make every day, no two are the same
I wanna be like, I wanna be like most girls
I wanna be like, I wanna be like most girls
I wanna be like, I wanna be like

[Post-Chorus]
They're staying out late 'cause they just celebrating
I wanna be like, I wanna be like
They're staying out late cause they just celebrating
I wanna be like, I wanna be like

Some girls like to keep their physique real private
Some girls wear jeans so tight 'cause it feels so right, yeah
Some girls, every day searching, keep the page turning
Sleeping in late 'cause they just celebrating life

[Pre-Chorus]
You know some days you feel so good in your own skin
But it's okay if you wanna change the body that you came in
'Cause you look greatest when you feel like a damn queen
We're all just playing a game in a way, trying to win at life

[Chorus]
Most girls are smart and strong and beautiful
Most girls work hard, go far, we are unstoppable
"Most girls": Our fight to make every day, no two are the same

I don't hate you
No, I couldn't if I wanted to
I just hate all the hurtthatyou put methrough
And that I blame myself forletting you
Did you know I already knew?

[Pre-Chorus]
Couldn't even see you through the smoke
Lookin' back, I probably should have known
But I just wanted to believe that you were out sleepin' alone

[Chorus]
Loved me with your worst intentions
Didn't even stop to question
Every time you burned me down
Don't know how; for a moment it felt like heaven
Loved me with your worst intentions
Painted us a happy ending
Every time you burned me down
Don't know how; for a moment it felt like heaven

[Post-Chorus]
And it's so gut-wrenchin'
Fallin' in the wrong direction

[Verse 2]
On my tip-toes
But I still couldn't reach your ego
Guess I was crazy to give you my body, my mind
Don't know what I was thinkin' 'til now
Everyone thinks that you're somebody else
You even convinced yourself

[Pre-Chorus]
Couldn't even see you through the smoke
Lookin' back, I probably should have known
But I just wanted to believe that you were out sleepin' alone

[Chorus]
Loved me with your worst intentions
Didn't even stop to question
Every time you burned me down
Don't know how; for a moment it felt like heaven
Loved me with your worst intentions
Painted us a happy ending
Every time you burned me down
Don't know how; for a moment it felt like heaven

[Post-Chorus]
And it's so gut-wrenchin' 
Fallin' in the wrong direction 
How did you sweep me right off my feet?
Baby, I can't keep
Fallin' in the wrong direction
How did you sweep me right off my feet?
Right off my feet

[Pre-Chorus]
Couldn't even see you through the smoke
Lookin' back, I probably should have known
But I just wanted to believe that you were out sleepin' alone

[Chorus]
Loved me with your worst intentions
Didn't even stop to question 
Every time you burned me down 
Don't know how; for a moment it felt like heaven
Loved me with your worst intentions
Painted us a happy ending 
Every time you burned me down 
Don't know how; for a moment, it felt like heaven

[Post-Chorus]
And it's so gut-wrenchin'
Fallin' in the wrong direction

[Verse 1: Hailee Steinfeld]
What are we fighting for?
Seems like we do it just for fun
In this, this stupid war
We play hard with our plastic guns
Breathe deep, bottle it up
So deep until it's all we got
Don't speak, just use your touch
Don't speak before we say too much

[Pre-Chorus: Hailee Steinfeld]
That you hate me now and I feel the same way
You love me now and I feel the same way
Scream and we shout
And make up the same day, the same day

[Chorus: Hailee Steinfeld]
Oh, we're on the right side of rock bottom
And I hope that we keep falling
We're on the good side of bad karma
'Cause we keep on coming back for more
We're on the right side of rock bottom
And to you, I just keep crawling
You're the best kind of bad something
'Cause we keep on coming back for more

[Verse 2: Joe Jonas]
You get under my skin
More than anyone's ever been
But when we lay in bed
You hold me harder 'til I forget

[Pre-Chorus: Hailee Steinfeld & Joe Jonas]
That you hate me now and I feel the same way
You love me now and I feel the same way
Scream and we shout
And make up the same day, the same day

[Chorus: Hailee Steinfeld & Joe Jonas]
Oh, we're on the right side of rock bottom
And I hope that we keep falling
We're on the good side of bad karma

You're the best kind of bad something
'Cause we keep on coming back for more

[Verse 1]
Seems like everybody here
Is speaking different languages 
With that green prescription fog
Blowing out their faces 

[Pre-Chorus]
And they all look me up and down like I'm the fucking new kid
But I saw the sun rise on this town way before you did
And they're all skiing in the powder room
Making love to Jack and Jameson 
But I'll stick with hell no's and headphones

[Chorus]
Cause all of my friends are leaving soon
To find them, themselves another round
But I'll be here in this stranger's room
Just for now 
Yeah, I'll stick with hell no's and headphones
Don't want another drink
I just, just wanna be alone
No, I don't care 'bout what you think
I'm going home
Yeah, I'll stick with hell no's and headphones

[Verse 2]
Twenty-seven blocks ago
I didn't even say goodbye 
People blowin' up my phone
Askin' me if I'm alright 

[Pre-Chorus]
And they're sending pictures, kissing on each other, like wasted
And on top on that, they're sending videos of them naked
But you know I don't judge what's on your tongue
Yeah, I know you're having fun 
But I'll stick with hell no's and headphones

[Chorus]
Cause all of my friends are leaving soon
To find them, themselves another round
But I'll be here in this stranger's room
Just for now 
Yeah, I'll stick with hell no's and headphones
Don't want another drink
I just, just wanna be alone
No, I don't care 'bout what you think
I'm going home
Yeah, I'll stick with hell no's and headphones

[Bridge]

Hell no's and headphones

[Chorus]
Cause all of my friends are leaving soon

Don't want another drink
I just, just wanna be alone 
No, I don't care 'bout what you think
I'm going home 
Yeah, I'll stick with hell no's and headphones 

[Verse 1]
You keep calling, you keep calling
Saying that you want it back
All my loving, all my loving
But you can't, you can't
You keep trying, you keep trying
With that sweet talk on your tongue
But I'm not buying, I'm not buying
I can't, I can't

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause you had your chance and you blew it
Yeah, you ripped it up and you chewed it
And the more you talk, you prove it
Yeah, you prove it

[Chorus]
That, damn, you're such a
Did you think that I would let you
Crawl right back into my bedroom
After everything we've been through
I know the truth
That, damn, you're such a
Difficult little devil
Trying to put it back together
'Cause you see I'm doing better
Without you now

[Post-Chorus]
Damn, you're such a

Those electric cigarettes
Are you joking? Are you joking?

And the more you talk, you prove it

'Cause I don't want to hear it anymore
And if you're all that's left when the whole world ends
No, I still don't want to hear it anymore
 mmm
Damn, you're such a

Damn, you're such a

[Verse 1]
Red eyes, like the smoke we rise
As the candle's burning low
Trust me in whatever youlike
Areyou playing withme?

[Pre-Chorus]
Every time your name, it leavesmy lips
Burning still, like words left unsaid
Fire in my veins, drink deeply, love
Remind me I'm alive

[Chorus]
Will you love me when my heartbeat stops?
When my heartbeat stops, will you stay mine? 
Will you promise me you'll search for us?
Will you find me after life? 
Oh, for better or for worse
Will death be our last kiss, my love? 
Will you promise me you'll search for us?
Will you find me after life? 

[Verse 2]
My ear is buzzing
Oh, I'm trapped, no one's coming
Immortality is bliss
You put me down, then put me on a pedestal
Now that I'm gone, you're gonna miss me

[Pre-Chorus]
Every time your name, it leaves my lips
Burning still, like words left unsaid
Fire in my veins, drink deeply, love
Remind me I'm alive

[Chorus]
Will you love me when my heartbeat stops?
When my heartbeat stops, will you stay mine? 
Will you promise me you'll search for us?
Will you find me after life? 
Oh, for better or for worse
Will death be our last kiss, my love? 
Will you promise me you'll search for us?
Will you find me after life? 

[Bridge]
Candle's burning
Will you find, will you find me after life?
Oh, after life, the afterlife
Will you love  in the afterlife?
Will you love , will you love me?
Will you love  in the afterlife?
Will you love , will you love me?

[Chorus]
Will you love me when my heartbeat stops?
When my heartbeat stops, will you stay mine?
Will you promise me you'll search for us?
Will you find me after life? 
Oh, for better or for worse
Will death be our last kiss, my love? Oh-oh
When my heartbeat stops, will you stay mine?

Doo-bee-doo-bee-doo-doo-doo, ah
Doo-bee-doo-bee

[Verse 1]
Where do I begin?
I'm sittin' here jaded
Yeah, I fell asleep with the makeupstillon my skin
Wideawake again
I'm prayin' I make it
Istep in the twelve but it's somewhere I've already been

[Pre-Chorus]
Diamondswon'tfoolme 'cause I'mtoo far gone
WishI could get back the air in my lungs
I've been so fucked up it's bad for my heart
My heart

[Chorus]
So, no more I love you's 
It's too easy to say, yeah 
No more I love you's 
Until I'm okay 

[Post-Chorus]
Yeah, I blamed it on the time zones 
I blamed it on my eyes closed 
I blamed it on the world like it owes me 
So stop me before it's too late 
No more I love you's 
Until I'm okay 

[Verse 2]
Oh, I face my sins
And I wish it was easy
Now I fall asleep with the light on but still without you
So I'll make amends
And I'll buy myself flowers
And then when they die, I'll be happy that they got me through

[Pre-Chorus]
Diamonds won't fool me 'cause I'm too far gone
Wish I could get back the air in my lungs
I've been so fucked up it's bad for my heart
My heart

[Chorus]
So, no more I love you's 
It's too easy to say, yeah 
No more I love you's 
Until I'm okay 

[Post-Chorus]
Yeah, I blamed it on the time zones 
I blamed it on my eyes closed 
I blamed it on the world like it owes me 
So stop me before it's too late 
No more I love you's 
Until I'm okay 

[Bridge]
It's not on my lips and I love it
No weight on my chest, I'm above it
I'm taking a moment to cut it out 
I feel my conscience is callin'
Now there's no fear, no more runnin'
I don't want words that mean nothin', no

[Chorus]
Oh, no more I love you's 
It's too easy to say, yeah 
No more I love you's 
Until I'm okay , yeah

[Post-Chorus]
I blamed it on the time zones 
I blamed it on my eyes closed 
I blamed it on the world like it owes me 
So stop me before it's too late 
No more I love you's 
Until I'm okay 

[Intro]
'Cause I'm bringing you back to life

[Verse 1]
Our love's enough
Transcending us through space and time
It's holding up
It keeps you and me intertwined

[Pre-Chorus]
What's a pipe dream if you ain't trying to do it?
What's a heartbreak if you ain't crying all through it?
What's a sunset if you ain't riding into it?
Let's drive into it

[Chorus]
'Cause I'm bringing you back to life 
And I know that you're gone but I swear that you're here
It's a feeling that won't disappear
And you're bringing me back to life 
I was looking for something that I couldn't find
It's a feeling you give me inside

[Post-Chorus]
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
'Cause I'm bringing you back to life
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
This feeling's coming back to life

[Verse 2]
Our memories
They're more than just our history 
They lift me up
They flow like electricity 

[Pre-Chorus]
What's a pipe dream if you ain't trying to do it?
What's a heartbreak if you ain't crying all through it?
What's a sunset if you ain't riding into it?
Let's drive into it

[Chorus]
'Cause I'm bringing you back to life 
And I know that you're gone but I swear that you're here
It's a feeling that won't disappear
And you're bringing me back to life 
I was looking for something that I couldn't find
It's a feeling you give me inside

[Post-Chorus]
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
'Cause I'm bringing you back to life
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

[Bridge]
I can see you in the night
Coming through like flashing lights
When the world is passing by
Oh, oh, oh
I can see you in the night
Coming through like flashing lights
When the world is passing by
Oh, oh, oh 

[Chorus]
'Cause I'm bringing you back to life 
And I know that you're gone but I swear that you're here
It's a feeling that won't disappear
And you're bringing me back to life 
I was looking for something that I couldn't find
It's a feeling you give me inside
'Cause I'm bringing you back
'Cause I'm bringing you back
'Cause I'm bringing you back to life
'Cause I'm bringing you back to life
And you're bringing me back 
And you're bringing me back
And you're bringing me back to life
This feeling's coming back to life

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
'Cause I'm bringing you back to life
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
This feeling's coming back to life

[Verse 1]
What are we fighting for?
Seems like we do it just for fun
In this, this stupid war
We play hard with our plastic guns
Breathe deep, bottle it up
So deep until it's all we got
Don't speak, just use your touch
Don't speak before we say too much

[Pre-Chorus]
That you hate me now and I feel the same way
You love me now and I feel the same way
Scream and we shout
And make up the same day, the same day

[Chorus]
Oh, we're on the right side of rock bottom
And I hope that we keep falling
We're on the good side of bad karma
Cause we keep on coming back for more
We're on the right side of rock bottom
And to you, I just keep crawling
You're the best kind of bad something
Cause we keep on coming back for more

[Verse 2]
You get under my skin
More than anyone's ever been
But when we lay in bed
You hold me harder 'til I forget

[Pre-Chorus]
That you hate me now and I feel the same way
You love me now and I feel the same way
Scream and we shout
And make up the same day, the same day

[Chorus]
Oh, we're on the right side of rock bottom
And I hope that we keep falling
We're on the good side of bad karma
'Cause we keep on coming back for more
We're on the right side of rock bottom
And to you, I just keep crawling
You're the best kind of bad something
'Cause we keep on coming back for more

[Post-Chorus]
Keep on coming back for more
Cause we keep on coming back for more

[Bridge]
What are we fighting for?
Seems like we do it just for fun
In this, this stupid war
We play hard with our plastic guns

[Chorus]
Oh, we're on the right side of rock bottom
And I hope that we keep falling
We're on the good side of bad karma
'Cause we keep on coming back for more
We're on the right side of rock bottom
And to you, I just keep crawling
You're the best kind of bad something
'Cause we keep on coming back for more

[Post-Chorus]
Keep on coming back for more
'Cause we keep on coming back for more
Keep on coming back for more
'Cause we keep on coming back for more

[Verse 1]
From walking home and talking loads
To seeing shows in evening clothes with you
From nervous touch and getting drunk
To staying up and waking up with you

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Now we're sleeping near the edge
Holding something we don't need
All this delusion in our heads is gonna bring us to our knees

[Chorus]
So come on, let it go
Just let it be
Why don't you be you, and I'll be me?
Everything that's broke
Leave it to the breeze
Why don't you be you, and I'll be me?
And I'll be me

[Verse 2]
From throwing clothes across the floor
To teeth and claws and slamming doors at you
If this is all we're living for
Why are we doing it, doing it, doing it anymore?

[Pre-Chorus 2]
I used to recognize myself
It's funny how reflections change
When we're becoming something else
I think it's time to walk away

[Chorus]
So come on, let it go
Just let it be
Why don't you be you, and I'll be me?
Everything that's broke
Leave it to the breeze
Why don't you be you, and I'll be me?
And I'll be me

[Bridge]
Tryna fit your hand inside of mine
When we know it just don't belong
Cause no force on earth could make it feel right, no no
Tryna push this problem up the hill
When it's just too heavy to hold
I think now's the time to let it slide

[Breakdown]
So come on, let it go
Just let it be
Why don't you be you, and I'll be me?
Everything that's broke
Leave it to the breeze
Let the ashes fall
Forget about me

[Chorus]
Come on, let it go
Just let it be
Why don't you be you, and I'll be me?
And I'll be me

[Verse 1]
Waking up, waking up
In a T shirt that says, I'm
Too busy doing nothing
Rolling up, oh I'm rolling up
To the kitchen to get some
Froot Loops in the morning
And all I want, baby all I want
Yeah all I wanna be is sprawled out on the mattress, uh
But no youre taking up, oh youre taking up
Oh youre taking up the space
Layin' where my chest is

[Pre-Chorus]
And Im used to doing, what I want, when I want
And now your occupying my brain a lot, yeah
And Im used to doing, what I want, when I want
And now youre occupying me

[Chorus]
And I could get used to this
Oh I could get used to this
Lips on my lips like this
Pulse on my skin like this
I could get used to this
Oh I could get used to this
Body on mine like this
All of the time like this

[Verse 2]
Move your seat, the driver's seat
Back to me and breathe
Readjust my mirrors
And I'll keep you safe, yeah Ill keep you safe
When you're drinking that red cup
Red cup, all clear

[Pre-Chorus]
And Im used to doing, what I want, when I want
And now your occupying my brain a lot, yeah
And Im used to doing, what I want, when I want
And now youre occupying me

[Chorus]
And I could get used to this
Oh I could get used to this
Back from a night like this
Hand on my chest like this
Oh, I could get used to this
I could get used to this
Hands on the floor like this
All of the time like this

[Bridge]
No I didnt realize that it could be this way
I underestimated it

[Chorus]
And I could get used to this
Oh I could get used to this
With someone else like this
Touching my skin like this
I could get used to this
Oh I could get used to this
Riding me up like this
All of the time like this

[Verse 1]
When tomorrow comes, Ill be on my own
Feeling frightened of the things that I dont know
When tomorrow comes
When tomorrow comes
When tomorrow comes
And though the road is long
I look up to the sky
Darkness all around I hope that I could fly
Then I sing along, I sing alone, then I sing alone

[Chorus]
I got all I need when I got you and I
Cause I look around me, and see a sweet life
Im stuck in the dark but youre my flashlight
Youre gettin me, gettin me through the night
Kickstart my heart when youre shinin in my eyes
Cant lie, Its a sweet life
Im stuck in the dark but youre my flashlight
Youre gettin me, gettin me through the night
Youre my flashlight 
Youre my flashlight 
Youre my flashlight

[Verse 2]
I see the shadows long beneath the mountain top
But Im not afraid, when the rain wont stop
Cause you light the way
You light the way, you light the way

[Chorus]
I got all I need when I got you and I
Cause I look around me, and see a sweet life
Im stuck in the dark but youre my flashlight
Youre gettin me, gettin me through the night
Kickstart my heart when youre shinin in my eyes
Cant lie, its a sweet life
Im stuck in the dark but youre my flashlight
Youre gettin me, gettin me through the night
Light, light in my flashlight
Light, light, and you cant deny
With you its a sweet life 
Oh-Ooh
I got all I need when I got you and I
Cause I look around me and see a sweet life
Im stuck in the dark but youre my flashlight
Youre gettin me, gettin me through the night
Kickstart my heart when youre shinin in my eyes
Cant lie, its a sweet life
Im stuck in the dark but youre my flashlight
Youre gettin me, gettin me through the night
Youre my flashlight
Youre my flashlight
Youre my flashlight 
Youre my flashlight
Youre my flashlight
Youre my flashlight
Yeah, Ooh

[Verse 1]
Some girls feel best in their tiny dresses
Some girls, nothin' but sweatpants, looking like a princess
Some girls kiss new lips every single night
They're stayin' out late cause they just celebrating life

[Pre-Chorus]
You know some days you feel so good in your own skin
But it's okay if you wanna change the body that you came in
'Cause you look greatest when you feel like a damn queen
We're all just playing a game in a way, trying to win at life

[Chorus]
Most girls are smart and strong and beautiful
Most girls work hard, go far, we are unstoppable
Most girls, our fight to make every day, no two are the same
I wanna be like, I wanna be like most girls
I wanna be like, I wanna be like most girls
I wanna be like, I wanna be like
I wanna be like, I wanna be like
I wanna be like, I wanna be like

[Verse 2]
Some girls like to keep their physique real private
Some girls wear jeans so tight 'cause it feels so right, yeah
Some girls, every day searching, keep the page turning
Sleepin' in late cause they just celebrating life

[Pre-Chorus]
You know some days you feel so good in your own skin
But it's okay if you wanna change the body that you came in
'Cause you look greatest when you feel like a damn queen
We're all just playing a game in a way, trying to win at life

[Chorus]
Most girls are smart and strong and beautiful
Most girls work hard, go far, we are unstoppable
Most girls, our fight to make every day, no two are the same
I wanna be like, I wanna be like most girls
I wanna be like, I wanna be like most girls
I wanna be like, I wanna be like
I wanna be like, I wanna be like, yeah

Time gonna go, so never waste [?]
Champagne kids, but it ain't no smoke show
Ayy-oh
Time gonna go, so never waste [?]

You got control to let it all go
Crash and burn but it ain't my issue
It's you
'Cause I got the love

[Pre-Chorus]
I wonder why we got the spark
If it's the vibe then don't deny

Keep goin' up
Keep goin' up, one, two

To the wild, running free
Acting like a fool, breaking all the rules
It's how it feels, to be young

Dance under the stars, just being who we are

[Verse 1]
For all the times that you rained on my parade
And all the clubs you get in using my name
You think you broke my heart, oh girl for goodness sake
You think I'm crying on my own, well I ain't

[Refrain]
And I didn't wanna write a song
'Cause I didn't want anyone thinking I still care
I don't but, you still hit my phone up
And baby I'll be movin' on
And I think you should be somethin'
I don't wanna hold back
Maybe you should know that

[Pre-Chorus]
My mama don't like you and she likes everyone
And I never like to admit that I was wrong
And I've been so caught up in my job, didn't see what's going on
And now I know, I'm better sleeping on my own

[Chorus]
'Cause if you like the way you look that much
Oh baby you should go and love yourself
And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'
You should go and love yourself

[Verse 2]
But when you told me that you hated my friends
The only problem was with you and not them
And every time you told me my opinion was wrong
And tried to make me forget where I came from

[Refrain]
And I didn't wanna write a song
'Cause I didn't want anyone thinking I still care
I don't but, you still hit my phone up
And baby I'll be movin' on
And I think you should be somethin'
I don't wanna hold back
Maybe you should know that

[Pre-Chorus]
My mama don't like you and she likes everyone
And I never like to admit that I was wrong
And I've been so caught up in my job, didn't see what's going on
And now I know, I'm better sleeping on my own

[Chorus]
'Cause if you like the way you look that much
Oh baby you should go and love yourself

[Verse 1]
Seems like everybody here
Is speaking different languages
With that green prescription fog
Blowing out their faces

[Pre-Chorus]
And they all look me up and down like I'm the fucking new kid
But I saw the sun rise on this town way before you did
And they're all skiing in the powder room
Making love to Jack and Jameson
But I'll stick with hell no's and headphones

[Chorus]
Cause all of my friends are leaving soon
To find them, themselves another round
But I'll be here in this stranger's room
Just for now
Yeah, I'll stick with hell no's and headphones
Don't want another drink
I just, just wanna be alone
No, I don't care 'bout what you think
I'm going home
Yeah, I'll stick with hell no's and headphones

[Verse 2]
Twenty-seven blocks ago
I didn't even say goodbye
People blowin' up my phone
Askin' me if I'm alright

[Pre-Chorus]
And they're sending pictures, kissing on each other, like wasted
And on top on that, they're sending videos of them naked
But you know I don't judge what's on your tongue
Yeah, I know you're having fun
But I'll stick with hell no's and headphones

[Chorus]
Cause all of my friends are leaving soon
To find them, themselves another round
But I'll be here in this stranger's room
Just for now
Yeah, I'll stick with hell no's and headphones
Don't want another drink
I just, just wanna be alone
No, I don't care 'bout what you think
I'm going home
Yeah, I'll stick with hell no's and headphones

[Bridge]
Hell no's and headphones

[Chorus]
Cause all of my friends are leaving soon
To find them, themselves another round
But I'll be here in this stranger's room

Yeah, I'll stick with hell no's and headphones
Don't want another drink
I just, just wanna be alone
No, I don't care 'bout what you think
I'm going home
Yeah, I'll stick with hell no's and headphones

It ain't my fault 
It ain't my fault

[Verse 2]
It ain't my fault you came here lookin' like that
You just made me trip, fall and land on your lap
Certain bad boy smooth
Body hotter than a summer
I don't mean to be rude, but I'd look so damn good on ya
Ain't got time right now
Missed me with that
"What's your name, your sign" right now
It's light outside
I just called an Uber and it's right outside
Oh my god, what is this?
Want you all in my business
Baby, I insist
Please don't blame me for whatever happens next

[Chorus]
No, I-I-I-I can't be responsible

But I won't be done when mornin' comes
Doin' it all night, all summer
Gonna spend it like no other

[Verse 1]
It was a crush
But I couldn't, couldn't get enough
It was a rush
But I gave it up
It was a crush
Now, I might've went and said too much
But, that's all it was
So, I gave it up

So I gave it up, ooh
No tricks, no bluff
I'm just better off without them cuffs
Yeah, the sun won't set on us
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, yeah, yeah

[Bridge]
Went low, went high
Still waters run dry
Gotta get back in the groove
I ain't ever worried
Went low, went high, what matters is now
Gettin' right back in the mood

[Chorus]
I live my day as if it was the last
Live my day as if there was no past
Doin' it all night, all summer
Doin' it the way I wanna
Yeah, I'ma dance my heart out 'til the dawn
But I won't be done when mornin' comes
Doin' it all night, all summer
Gonna spend it like no other
Now I've found another crush
The lush life's given me a rush
Had one chance to make me blush
Second time is one too late
Now I've found another crush
The lush life's given me a rush
Had one chance to make me blush
Second time is one too late

Ooh, ooh, woah, ooh, ooh

Doin' it all night, all summer
Gonna spend it like no other

No one else holdin' me down 
I can do just what I like

So please don't fall in love without me

[Verse 1]
I don't wanna shower, even if I stink
'Cause I don't wanna wash you off, wash you off my skin
It's been about an hour
And I'm still tremblin', oh
Feelin' you deep, feelin' you deep within
Eh-eh-eh, yeah-eh-eh

[Pre-Chorus]
Opened bottles on the drawer
Rollin' papers on the floor
Eh, don't want a cigarette yet
Don't want no drink on my breath, yes
Wanna taste your taste some more
Feel you pourin' through my pores
Eh, I'm goin' back in my bed to play it back in my head

[Chorus]
'Cause I can't love nobody like I love myself
Like I love myself, only you, ay
No one's ever touched me like I touch myself
No, nobody else, only you, only you
Only you

[Verse 2]
I feel you in my fingers, even in my toes
Steam upon the mirror and on the windows
Baby, that was it
Wish it would never end
I just wanna do it, do it again
Eh-eh-eh, yeah-eh-eh

[Pre-Chorus]
I can smell your smell, so sweet
On my pillow, on my sheets
Eh, I wanna keep it like that
Keep on sleepin' like that, yeah
Baby, you'll be hard to beat
What I have is yours to keep
Eh, I never wanted so bad, best that I ever had

[Chorus]
No, I can't love nobody like I love myself
Oh, like I love myself, only you, oh
No one's ever touched me like I touch myself
No, nobody else, only you, only you

[Bridge]
Only you
Only you
Only you
Oh-oh-oh-oh

[Chorus]
I can't love nobody like I love myself
Like I love myself, only you, only you
No one's ever touched me like I touch myself
No, nobody else 
Only you

[Intro]
Nobody sees, nobody knows
We are a secret, can't be exposed
That's how it is, that's how it goes
Far from the others
Close to each other

[Verse 1]
In the daylight, in the daylight
When the sun is shinin'
On a late night, on a late night
When the moon is blindin'
In plain sight, plain sight
Like stars in hidin'
You and I burn on, on

[Pre-Chorus]
Put two and together, forever
We'll never change
Two and together
We'll never change

[Chorus]
Nobody sees, nobody knows
We are a secret, can't be exposed
That's how it is, that's how it goes
Far from the others, close to each other
That's when we uncover-cover-cover
That's when we uncover-cover-cover

[Verse 2]
My asylum, my asylum
Is in your arms
When the world gives heavy burdens
I can bare a thousand tons
On your shoulder, on your shoulder
I can reach an endless sky
Feels like paradise

[Pre-Chorus]
Put two and together, forever
We'll never change
Two and together
We'll never change

[Chorus]
Nobody sees, nobody knows

All the world could disappear
Wouldn't notice, wouldn't care
We could build a universe right here
The world could disappear
Yeah, I just need you near

Nobody sees, nobody knows
We are a secret, can't be exposed
That's how it is, that's how it goes
Far from the others, close to each other

I may know myself, but I realise that I can be led astray
I know, I know that you're bad for my health
But I don't care, I want you anyway
Ayy, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
Boy, you think that you know me
Oh, but you can't see my lonely heart
Things look different in the mornin', oh
That's when we find out who we are
Would you still want me?
Without no makeup on my face?
Without alcohol in your veins?
Oh, would you, baby?
Would you still love me?
With all the promises you made
Would you still mean the words you say?
Oh, would you, baby?
Yeah

[Chorus]
You know everybody makes mistakes, mmm
Don't let me be yours
You know everybody makes mistakes
Don't let me be yours, no, don't let me be

Until I saw you with someone who's not me
You got me playin' in a game that ain't fair
But you're takin' me there, yeah, you're takin' me there

[Pre-Chorus]
 I can't help myself, it's human nature, human nature

Babe, it's incredible
When you're touching me, yeah, that says it all
You said it all

And you make me feel so fucking pretty
Take loving me to a new extreme
If I can't have you, I don't want no one
I don't want no one
As you make me dance in the middle of the street
On the hardwood floor, we should be asleep
If I can't have you, I don't want no one
I don't want no one, want no one, want no one

[Chorus]
Baby, I'm not even in a gown
I'm just in a T-shirt on the couch

From the breaking of the day to the middle of night
From the breaking of the day to the middle of night

[Verse 1]
Summertime and I'm caught in the feeling
Getting high and I'm up on the ceiling
I don't know what you're doing in New York
All I know is you ain't on my bedroom floor

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm seein' you undressed in my room
But it's just a memory, a fantasy
Are you in your house? Are you going out?
Are you going crazy like me?
From the breaking of the day to the middle of the night

[Chorus]
I try to forget about you, baby
And I die when I think of you with someone else and
I don't know why, I don't know why you're dancing in my mind
From the breaking of the day to the middle of the night
All the time
From the breaking of the day to the middle of the night
All the time

[Verse 2]
Everyone's been wearing your perfume
Everything is reminding me of you
I don't know what I'm doing in New York
But all I know is you ain't walking through the door

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm seein' you undressed in my room
But it's just a memory, a fantasy
Are you in your house? Are you going out?
Are you going crazy like me?
From the breaking of the day to the middle of the night

[Chorus]
I try to forget about you, baby
And I die when I think of you with someone else and
I don't know why, I don't know why you're dancing in my mind
From the breaking of the day to the middle of the night
I try to forget about you, baby
And I die when I think of you with someone else and
I don't know why, I don't know why you're dancing in my mind
From the breaking of the day to the middle of the night 

[Bridge]
And I wonder if you think about me, too
Where we used to go, what we used to do
And I wonder if you're crying out inside, oh yeah


Oh whoa
From the breaking of the day to the middle of the night

[Chorus]
I try to forget about you, baby 
And I die when I think of you with someone else and
I don't know why 
I don't know why you're dancing in my mind 
From the breaking of the day to the middle of the night
I try to forget about you, baby 
And I die when I think of you with someone else and
I don't know why, I don't know why you're dancing in my mind
From the breaking of the day to the middle of the night
All the time
From the breaking of the day to the middle of the night
All the time
From the breaking of the day to the middle of the night

[Chorus]
One Mississippi, you're here
Lovin' me with your whole heart
And two Mississippi, we scream
To watch each other fall apart
Three Mississippi, you're gone
Sayin' that you're done, you don't want it no more
And four Mississippi, you're home
Like nothin' ever happened at all

[Verse 1]
Why do I stay? I know I should leave
Mascara fallin' down my cheek
But you pull me in and make me forget
About the broken glass on our skin

[Pre-Chorus]
We don't get scared when the sirens come
A little fucked up 'cause we think it's fun
We kiss just to make up, we love just to break up
We head for disaster, but live for the danger
We count

[Chorus]
One Mississippi, you're here
Lovin' me with your whole heart
And two Mississippi, we scream
To watch each other fall apart
Three Mississippi, you're gone
Sayin' that you're done, you don't want it no more
And four Mississippi, you're home
Like nothin' ever happened at all

[Verse 2]
I like the way, that you set the scene
The way you breathe in your nicotine
I like the way it burns when you say goodbye
I like the way it hurts when you screw with my mind

[Pre-Chorus]
Or am I fucked up that I think it's fun?
That we don't get scared when the sirens come?
We kiss just to make up, we love just to break up
We head for disaster, but live for the danger
We count

[Chorus]
One Mississippi, you're here 
Lovin' me with your whole heart
And two Mississippi, we scream
To watch each other fall apart 
Three Mississippi, you're gone
Sayin' that you're done, you don't want it no more
And four Mississippi, you're home
Like nothin' ever happened at all

And four Mississippi, you're home 
Like nothin' ever happened at all 

[Verse 1]
I get high all the time
I get drunk on my mind and call you at five in the mornin'

And I say what I like
And I don't like playin' nice
I might pick a fight without warnin', when it gets borin'

[Pre-Chorus]
I try to keep it cool
And turn it down for you
But I'm never gonna change
And that's why I be sayin', boy

[Chorus]
You're too good for me, but I want, but I want you anyway
And I know I don't fit in, but I want, but I want you anyway
Only you, only me, and that's all that I need
Only you, only me, only you
Boy, you're too good for me, but I want, but I want you anyway, yeah

[Verse 2]
I don't pick up the phone
Take an hour or longer to write somethin' back when you text me

Tell you, "Leave me alone
Need some time on my own"
But soon as you gone, "Come and get me"
Oh, baby, come and get me, ah

[Pre-Chorus]
I try to keep it cool, yeah
And turn it down for you
But I'm never gonna change
And that's why I be sayin', boy

[Chorus]
You're too good for me, but I want, but I want you anyway
And I know I don't fit in, but I want, but I want you anyway
Only you, only me, and that's all that I need

[Verse 1]
Faded, we're fadin'
We ain't breathin' lately
No tomorrow, not for you and I
Hate it, I hate it
Can't believe I'm sayin' it
Call my friends and tell 'em we had died

[Pre-Chorus]
Our love, our love, our love
It is gone now
Our love, our love, our love
Took everything we had
Our love, our love, our love
Was real, I felt that
But it ain't comin' back
No, it ain't comin' back

[Chorus]
I wish you everything you've ever wanted in your life
This tastes so bittersweet, it's like I'm goin' under
Burn all the letters, all of my secrets, things only you know
Bury my heart six feet under, throw us a funeral
I wish you everything you've ever wanted in your life

[Verse 2]
Faded, get faded
Only thing that makes sense
Anything to take the pain away
Complicated, but I wanted us to make it
I was praying, waitin' for a change

[Pre-Chorus]
Our love, our love, our love
It is gone now
Our love, our love, our love
Took everything we had
Our love, our love, our love
Was real, I felt that
But it ain't comin' back
No, it ain't comin' back

[Chorus]
I wish you everything you've ever wanted in your life
This tastes so bittersweet, it's like I'm goin' under
Burn all the letters, all of my secrets, things only you'd know
Bury my heart six feet under, throw us a funeral
I wish you everything you've ever wanted in your life

[Bridge]
Burn all the letters, all of my secrets
Things only you'd know
Bury my heart six feet under, throw us a funeral
Burn all the letters, all of my secrets
Things only you'd know
Bury my heart six feet under, throw us a funeral

[Chorus]
I wish you everything you've ever wanted in your life
This tastes so bittersweet, it's like I'm goin' under
Burn all the letters, all of my secrets, things only you'd know
Bury my heart six feet under, throw us a funeral
I wish you everything you've ever wanted in your life

Say your last, say your last
Say your last goodbye

How many nights do you lie awake
In the darkest place? 
How many days doyoushed the pain
Ofyour darker days? 

[Pre-Chorus]
All Iknow is
If happy lives a mile away
A couple steps is all it takes
If kindness lives in everyone
Then all it takes isn't enough

[Chorus]
Can't touch it, see it 
But you can always feel it 
The greatest things you'll ever know
Are invisible 

[Verse 2]
How many words does it really take
To make a change? 
How many fights is it gonna take
To convince what joy could bring? 

[Pre-Chorus]
All I know is
If happy lives a mile away
A couple steps is all it takes
If kindness lives in everyone
Then all it takes isn't enough

And all I want is somethin' like seein' you smile
Oh, yes, I do

[Pre-Chorus]
But, you don't have to be here anymore
So whatcha gonna do?
Just go and call it off
But what if I try another way? 
Just take a little advice from me

Whatever you do, just don't believe what they say
Whatever you do, just don't believe what they say
'Cause they don't believe you like I believe in you anyway
So whatever you do, whatever you do, babe
Just don't believe what they

[Verse 2]
Never lie
I'd go to the edge of the line every time for you
Just do what you need, and I know that it's golden
Just take what you want, and leave what you don't
Let the world sink in and stick to your bones

'Cause you don't have to be here anymore
I'm holdin' on to you, so you're not fallin' off 
So what if I try another day?

[Verse 1]
She doesn't love you like I do
She doesn't have my name
However she tries to act like it
She'll never be the same

[Pre-Chorus 1]
But she's new, and she's beautiful
You've never been in a fight
Yeah, it's awfully perfect now
But you just know deep inside

[Chorus 1]
She is not me
She is not me
She is not me, baby
She is not me

[Verse 2]
Does she make you feel wanted like I did?
Make you feel like you're the one thing that matters?
You let her head rest on your chest
But when you close your eyes...

[Pre-Chorus 2]
You'll be seeing my face again
I'll be crossing your mind
You'll be dreaming of places we went
And then you'll wake up to find...

Remember that she is not me, aye

Yeah, I wonder how you've been
Are you happy?
Is she still the one?
Are you having fun?
Is it for real, baby?
'Cause I'll be waiting here
Another week, or month or year
If you're lonely
God, I wish I knew everything about the two of you
Won't you tell me?

[Verse 2]
Does she have any humor?
Does she laugh at your jokes?
Can she look past the rumors?
Does she know how it goes?
Aye, or is it none of my business?
Do you go to the movies?
Do you make out in the park?
Do you stay up for hours?
And just talking the talk?
Aye, or is it none of my business?
Does she know 'bout the bracelets that were two of a kind?
Did you save, did you save it like I did mine?
Aye, or is it none of my business?
Would it make any difference if I got you alone?
If I called, would you listen?
Would you hang up the phone?
Aye, or is it none of my business?

[Break]
None of my business
Is it none of my business?
None of my business
Is it none of my business?

She's not me, and she'll never be, never be, never be
She's not me, and she'll never be, never be, never be, yeah

I've been knocked down, I've been lost
With a ground shaking under my feet
I gave it all to someone who'd said, "fire, run"
I've been, I've been through the days
When bright love turns into hate
You bend, and you bend 'til you break
'Til the lights are gone

[Pre-Chorus]
When the one you care for just takes it all
Washing you down like a waterfall
You lose the way and you hit the wall
I'll be the one, I'll be the one, I'll be the one to

[Chorus]
Carry you home
When it hurts like you've crashed from above
Heal your broken bones
When you can't move and your heart's still locked up
You rise, you rise, you rise
Sometimes you need someone to carry you home
When it hurts like you've crashed from above
When it's true love

[Verse 2]
Ive been knocked down on my own
With waters too deep and too cold
Sleepless so many nights
With a broken heart running wild

[Pre-Chorus]
When the one you care for just takes it all
Washing you down like a waterfall 
You lose the way and you hit the wall
I'll be the one, I'll be the one, I'll be the one to

[Chorus]
Carry you home
When it hurts like you've crashed from above
Heal your broken bones
When you cant move and your hearts still locked up
Oh, you rise, you rise, you rise
Sometimes you need someone to carry you home
When it hurts like you've crashed from above
When it's true love

[Bridge]
When it's true love
When it's true love, whoa
Ooh, I'll be the one, I'll be the one, I'll be the one to carry you home!

[Chorus]
Carry you home
When it hurts like you've crashed from above 
Heal your broken bones 
When you can't move and your heart's still locked up 
You rise, you rise, you rise 
Sometimes you need someone to carry you home 
When it hurts like you've crashed from above
When it's true love

It ain't my fault you keep turnin' me on
It ain't my fault you got, got me so gone
It ain't my fault I'm not leavin' alone
It ain't my fault you keep turnin' me on

[Pre-Chorus 1: Zara Larsson]
I can't talk right now
I'm lookin' and I like what I'm seein'
Got me feelin' kinda shocked right now
Couldn't stop right now
Even if I wanted, gotta get it, get it, get it, when it's hot right now
Oh my god, what is this?
Want you all in my business
Baby, I insist
Please don't blame me for what ever happens next

[Chorus: Zara Larsson]
No, I-I-I-I can't be responsible
If I-I-I-I get you in trouble now
See, you're-'re-'re-'re too irresistible
Yeah, that's for sure
So if I put your hands where my eyes can't see
That you're the one who's got a hold on me
No, I-I-I-I can't be responsible, responsible
It ain't my fault 
It ain't my fault 
It ain't my fault

[Verse 2: Zara Larsson]
It ain't my fault you came here lookin' like that
You just made me trip, fall, and land on your lap
Certain bad boy smooth
Body hotter than a summer
I don't mean to be rude, but I'd look so damn good on ya

[Pre-Chorus 2: Zara Larsson]
Ain't got time right now
Missed me with that
"What's your name, your sign" right now
It's light outside
I just called an Uber and it's right outside
Oh my god, what is this?
Want you all in my business
Baby, I insist
Please don't blame me for what ever happens next

[Chorus: Zara Larsson]
No, I-I-I-I can't be responsible
If I-I-I-I get you in trouble now
See, you're-'re-'re-'re too irresistible
Yeah, that's for sure
So if I put your hands where my eyes can't see
That you're the one who's got a hold on me
No, I-I-I-I can't be responsible, responsible
It ain't my fault

[Verse 3: Lil Yachty]
Where's your thot?
Called my friends like, "What you caught last night?"
If the ass right and you ask right, you might spend the night
Sitting so informal with the Sailing Team
And we just might start a dinner fight
Need a white chick that's Kylie Jenner right
Need a black chick that cook my dinner right
But aye, get your bread though, snitches, 5-0
I can't kick it with no side hoe
I need that Lambo
Come through bustin' like I'm Rambo with heavy ammo
And I'm lit just like a candle
Stock up like sandals 

[Bridge: Zara Larsson]
Baby, one, two, three
Your body's callin' me
And I know wherever you're at is exactly where I wanna be
But don't blame me
It ain't my fault 
It ain't my fault 
It ain't my fault 
It ain't my fault
Oh my, oh my, oh my, oh my

[Chorus: Zara Larsson]
So if I put your hands where my eyes can't see
That you're the one who's got a hold on me
No, I-I-I-I can't be responsible, responsible
It ain't my fault 
No-oh-oh, it ain't my fault
No-oh-oh, no-oh-oh, no 
It ain't my fault
It ain't my fault you got me so gone
It ain't my fault you got me so gone
Well, that's too bad, it ain't my fault

[Chorus: Zara Larsson]
I live my day as if it was the last
Live my day as if there was no past
Doin' it all night, all summer
Doin' it the way I wanna
Yeah Imma dance my heart out til the dawn
But I wont be done when morning comes
Doin' it all night, all summer
Gonna spend it like no other

[Verse 1: Zara Larsson]
It was a crush
But I couldnt, couldnt get enough
It was a rush
But I gave it up
It was a crush
Now, I might have went and said too much
But thats all it was
So I gave it up

[Chorus: Zara Larsson]
I live my day as if it was the last
Live my day as if there was no past
Doin' it all night, all summer
Doin' it the way I wanna
Yeah Imma dance my heart out til the dawn
But I wont be done when morning comes
Doin' it all night, all summer
Gonna spend it like no other

[Verse 2: Tinie Tempah]
Get lit, all night, all summer
I paint pics so bright, so colored
On Instagram I don't like no other
So baby, why you don't write don't holla
Let's have a shot and get loose, get wavy
Cause we're sippin' on the juice that they've been
Catch shawarmas in Maroush, party with my troops, switch Ferrari to the coupe's
Maybe mention we can party on my roof
Cause it's a new year, all nighty
New spring, summer, new money
Skirt, new car key
Said she weren't clever in her class
First time she got a star
And now she wanna F somebody
And I just smashed a record with my seventh number one
I was praying for a time when I thought it would never come
Now I'm like no other
I'm sitting pretty high
With my stone cold stunner


[Chorus: Zara Larsson]
I live my day as if it was the last
Live my day as if there was no past
Doin' it all night, all summer
Doin' it the way I wanna
Yeah Imma dance my heart out til the dawn
But I wont be done when morning comes
Doin' it all night, all summer
Gonna spend it like no other

[Post-Chorus: Zara Larsson]
Now I've found another crush
The lush life's given me a rush
Had one chance to make me blush
Second time is one too late
Now I've found another crush
The lush life's given me a rush
Had one chance to make me blush
Second time is one too late

[Bridge: Zara Larsson]
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh

[Chorus: Zara Larsson]

Gonna spend it like no other

[Post-Chorus: Zara Larsson]

Second time is one too lateMary, did you know that your baby boy
Would one day walk on water?
Mary, did you know that your baby boy
Would save our sons and daughters?
Did you know that your baby boy
Has come to make you new?
This child that youve delivered, will soon deliver you

Mary, did you know that your baby boy
Would give sight to a blind man?
Mary, did you know that your baby boy
Would calm the storm with his hand?

Did you know that your baby boy
Has walked where angels trod?
When you kiss your little baby
You kiss the face of God

Mary, did you know?
Mary, did you know?
Mary, did you know?
Mary, did you know?

The blind will see
The deaf will hear
The dead will live again
The lame will leap
The dumb will speak
The praises of the lamb

Mary, did you know that your baby boy
Is lord of all creation?
Mary, did you know that your baby boy
Would one day rule the nation?

Did you know that your baby boy is heavens Perfect lamb?
The sleeping child youre holding is the great I am

Mary, did you know?
Mary, did you know?
Mary, did you know?
Mary, did you know?

[Intro]
We could be soulmates
We could be so great
We could be happy
One day, some day, or in a whole 'nother lifetime

[Verse 1]
Said the first time that we locked eyes, the shit was crazy
And the second time just blew my mind, the shit was crazy
Lately I don't know what I'm supposed to do
'Cause I got someone, and baby, so do you

[Chorus]
It was the 3rd of September, we were hanging up on the roof
Was the hot, hot night, we were having a barbecue
And I said "Hi", you said "Hi", baby, that's when I knew
I just, I just can't, can't take my mind off you
It was a night to remember, we were hanging up on the roof
Someone got knocked out and in came the boys in blue
And you said "Bye", I said "Bye", some of that made the news
I just, I just can't, can't take my mind off you

[Bridge]
One night on the rooftop
One night on the rooftop, rooftop
One sight at the rooftop
At the rooftop, rooftop

[Verse 2]
Then the rain came, something caught flame, and it was crazy
Yeah, there were sirens and firemen, the shit was crazy
Baby rushing down the stairs, I see you go
It was the saddest thing that I will ever know

[Chorus]
It was the 3rd of September, we were hanging up on the roof
Was the hot, hot night, we were having that barbecue
And I said "Hi", you said "Hi", baby, that's when I knew
I just, I just can't, can't take my mind off you
It was a night to remember, we were hanging up on the roof
Someone got knocked out and in came the boys in blue
And you said "Bye", I said "Bye", some of that made the news
I just, I just can't, can't take my mind off you

[Bridge]
One night on the rooftop
One night on the rooftop, rooftop
One sight at the rooftop
At the rooftop, rooftop
Sparks fly on the rooftop
Friends fight on the rooftop, rooftop
Bright lights at the rooftop
At the rooftop, rooftop

[Midtro]
We could be soulmates
We could be so great
We could be happy
One day, some day

[Chorus]
It was the 3rd of September, we were hanging up on the roof
Was the hot, hot night, we were having a barbecue
And I said "Hi", you said "Hi", baby, that's when I knew
I just, I just can't, can't take my mind off you
It was a night to remember, we were hanging up on the roof
Someone got knocked out and in came the boys in blue
And you said "Bye", I said "Bye", some of that made the news
I just, I just can't, can't take my mind off you 

[Bridge]
One night on the rooftop
One night on the rooftop, rooftop 
One sight at the rooftop 
At the rooftop, rooftop
Sparks fly on the rooftop
Friends fight on the rooftop, rooftop
Bright lights at the rooftop
At the rooftop, rooftop

[Verse 1: Zara Larsson & Olivier Dion]
I don't wanna shower even if I stink
'Cause I don't wanna wash you off
Wash you off my skin

Enrouls dans les draps

[Pre-Chorus: Zara Larsson & Olivier Dion]
Opened bottles on the drawer

No one's ever touched me like I touch myself
No, nobody else, only you, only you
Only you

[Verse 1]
The middle of the night
There ain't nobody home
You're all that's on my mind when I'm in bed alone
See now, I'm with this guy
He's blowing up my phone
Say he wants to wife me, but that's not what I want

[Pre-Chorus]
How can we work it out, when you're all, all I think about when I'm with him?
I bet he doesn't even know
I bet he doesn't even notice
How I do my hair or what I wear
Whenever you're there
Don't wanna give in, but you make me wanna go
Yeah, you make me wanna

[Chorus]
You make me wanna leave the one I'm with
He don't show me no love
You make me wanna leave the one I'm with
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
You make me wanna leave him to be with somebody like you
You make me wanna leave the one I'm with
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
You make me wanna

[Post-Chorus]
You make me wanna
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse 2]
When we're eye to eye, I wonder what we'd be
In another life, it was you and me
My boyfriend is alright, but he isn't right for me
I guess you are my type, we were meant to be, but

[Pre-Chorus]
How can we work it out, when you're all, all I think about when I'm with him?
I bet he doesn't even know
I bet he doesn't even notice
How I do my hair or what I wear
Whenever you're there
Don't wanna give in, but you make me wanna go
Yeah, you make me wanna

[Chorus]
You make me wanna leave the one I'm with
He don't show me no love
You make me wanna leave the one I'm with
Yeah, yeah, yeah

You make me wanna leave him to be with somebody like you
You make me wanna leave the one I'm with
Yeah, yeah, yeah

[Post-Chorus]
You make, make me
Make, make, make me
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah

[Bridge]
Nights like this make me wish it was you 
Your tender touch, I'll be coming on to 
We're meant to be together
Wish you would treat me better
So tonight I'm gonna 
I'ma love you
Oh, oh, yeah, yeah

[Chorus]
You make me wanna leave the one I'm with
He don't show me no love
You make me wanna leave the one I'm with

[Intro]
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

[Verse 1]
Ask me to stay and I'm not gonna leave
Don't make me wait with my heart on my sleeve
'Cause I won't go 'less you want me to
I'd surrender it all for you
Friends turn to foes, I don't know who to trust
You say I worry, I worry too much
But I can't help what I'm feeling now
I just want us to be somehow

[Chorus]
I said there's something 'bout the bad boys
That makes the good girls fall in love
I said there's something 'bout the bad boys
That makes the good girls fall in love

[Verse 2]
Clear as a crystal or sharp as a knife
Words will be words 'til you bring them to life
Show the whole world that you're mine alone
Tell them girls to go find their own

[Chorus]
I said there's something 'bout the bad boys
That makes the good girls fall in love

I said there's something 'bout the bad boys
That makes the good girls fall in love


[Bridge]
Don't leave me stranded 
Don't lead me on 
I'd rather feel abandoned 
Then please be gone

[Chorus]
I said there's something 'bout the bad boys
That makes the good girls fall in love

I said there's something 'bout the bad boys
That makes the good girls fall in love
[Verse 1]
Early morning
Someone's calling
Who could this be?
Reach my phone and your name showing on my caller ID
I decline, and change my mind, and call you back up
You say, "Hey," I say, "Hey."
Then we don't say too much

[Pre-Chorus 1]
It's almost like singing that sad song
You make it so easy to hang on

[Chorus]
'Cause I've a weak heart
Baby, I've a weak heart
Yeah, I-I-I-I have such a weak heart
Baby, I've a weak heart
Yeah, I-I-I-I, when it comes to you
I put my money on a long shot
 when it comes to you
It's like I want it, but I can't stop

Yeah, I've a weak heart
Baby, I've a weak heart

[Verse 2]
You come over
I say slow now
This can't go on
Grab a chair, please
Sit right there
It's time we had a talk
Boy, talk is the touching
And then it's on to the next
Body to body until I'm catching my breath
This is not what I'm supposed to do
Try to shake it off, but I'm stuck on you

[Pre-Chorus 2]
So I'mma keep singing this sad song
It never felt better to be wrong

[Chorus]
'Cause I've a weak heart
Baby, I've a weak heart
Yeah, I-I-I-I have such a weak heart
Baby, I've a weak heart
Yeah, I-I-I-I, when it comes to you
I put my money on a long shot
 when it comes to you
It's like I want it, but I can't stop

Yeah, I've a weak heart
Baby, I've a weak heart

[Intro]
Oh my, oh my, oh my
Oh my, oh my, oh my
Oh my, oh my, oh my, oh my

[Verse 1]
It ain't my fault your man's calling my phone
It ain't my fault you can't keep him at home
It ain't my fault I give him what you don't
No, it ain't my fault your man's calling my phone
I can't talk right now, he's on the other line
He's on his way to my house right now
'Cause I'm hot right now
All the boys coming so I gotta, so I gotta get mine right now
Oh my god, what is this?
Your problems ain't my business
I can't help you out
'Cause Im not the guy that made my girl false promises

[Pre-Chorus 1]
No I-I-I-I, can't be responsible
If your-our-our man don't love you anymore
See, he-e-e-e's the one you gotta call
Yeah, that's for sure
'Cause if he hits me up and he wants to come through
Then he's the one you should be talking to
No I-I-I-I, can't be responsible, responsible

[Chorus]
It ain't my fault 
It ain't my fault 
It ain't my fault

[Verse 2]
It ain't my fault he likes spending time with me
He could be with you but he leaves you lonely
Looks like he got you in a sticky situation
If you were putting it down this wouldn't be a conversation
He's at mine right now
We doing things that you wouldn't dare to believe right now
Stop wilding out
If he wanted to he'd be with you right now
Oh my god, what is this?
Your problems ain't my business
I can't help you out
'Cause Im not the guy that made my girl false promises

[Pre-Chorus 1]
No I-I-I-I, can't be responsible
If your-our-our man don't love you anymore
See, he-e-e-e's the one you gotta call
Yeah, that's for sure
Cause if he hits me up and he wants to come through
Then he's the one you should be talking to
No I-I-I-I, can't be responsible, responsible

[Chorus]
It ain't my fault 
It ain't my fault 
It ain't my fault

[Bridge]
Baby, calling me asking where is he
It doesn't matter where's he at
It's where he's at is where he wants to be
So basically, it ain't my fault 
It ain't my fault 
It ain't my fault 
It ain't my fault
Oh my, oh my, oh my, oh my

[Pre-Chorus 2]
'Cause if he hits me up and he wants to come through
Then he's the one you should be talking to
No I-I-I-I, can't be responsible, responsible

[Chorus]
It ain't my fault 
It ain't my fault 
Whoa, whoa, no, no no

It ain't my fault

It ain't my fault

It ain't my fault
Girl, that's too bad, it ain't my fault

[Verse 1]
Sometimes at night
When I turn off the lights
I be thinking about you
Baby, baby, baby, yeah
Tossing in my bed
All these thoughts in my head
Got me losing my breath now
Baby, baby, baby, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
Tell me what would you do 
If you only knew 
How I feel about you
About you-ou

[Chorus]
I wanna be first, your last, your everything
I wanna be in your arms indefinitely
I wanna be someone you keep coming back to see
I wanna be what 
I wanna be who 
Wanna be your baby

[Verse 2]
Deep down inside
There's an unending fire
And I just can't contain it
Baby, baby, baby, yeah
You're the only one who can
Show me that you feel the same
I wanna hear you say my name
Baby, baby, baby, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
Tell me what would you do 
If you only knew 
How I feel about you
About you, you, you

[Chorus]
I wanna be first , your last, your everything 
I wanna be in  your arms  indefinitely 
I wanna be someone you keep coming back to see
I wanna be what 
I wanna be who 
Wanna be your baby

[Breakdown]
Hoo-hoo-hoo
Hoo-hoo
Hoo-hoo-hoo
Hoo-hoo

[Chorus]
I wanna be first , your last , your everything
I wanna be in  your arms  indefinitely 
I wanna be someone you keep  coming back to see 
I wanna be what 
I wanna be who 
I wanna be your baby-yeah-yay

[Outro]
I wanna be your baby
Baby, baby, baby-yeah-yeah-yaaay
Ooh yay
Ooh yay, hey-by
Ba-by
Ay-yay

[Verse 1]
Do you recognize the song anymore?
Do you recognize the sound of my voice?
Does it get drowned in the noise?
I wonder if you found what you want

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Maybe I'm telling myself a lie when I stay
I'm the only one still on your mind
You will be mine someday
I feel you when I'm in the dark
I still don't know how to move on
I'm sick and in love, but I feel in my gut
Yeah, I know that you are the one

[Chorus 1]
Used to say forever, but it's never now
Thought we'd be together, but we separate now
You are my first, and that's why it hurts
The fire that burns, it ain't never gonna die
Naw, it ain't never gonna die
It ain't never gonna...

[Verse 2]
Is it even worth the time anymore?
It's different this time, ain't it, boy?
'Cause that's always what you say, what you say
But I'm better at the games that you play

[Pre-Chorus 2]
I'm taking it back what's mine
'Cause you said it's forever
Stand through the test of time
If we dare stay together
I ain't gonna wait in line
I'm patient, but I'm not blind
We're young so we got the time, make it right, alright

[Chorus 2]
Used to say forever, but it's never now
Thought we'd be together, but we separate now
You are my first, and that's why it hurts
The fire that burns, it ain't never gonna die
Never thought I'd ever say we're strangers now
All the love we had has turned to hate somehow
You are my first, and that's why it hurts
The fire that burns, it ain't never gonna die
Naw, it ain't never gonna die
Naw, it ain't never gonna die
Never gonna die
Never gonna die, no

[Bridge]
Here we are in this place again
Somewhere between eternal love and no longer
And if I never see your face again
I hope you know that will never be another like you

[Chorus 2]
Used to say forever, but it's never now
Thought we'd be together, but we separate now
You are my first, and that's why it hurts
The fire that burns, it ain't never gonna die
Never thought I'd ever say we're strangers now
All the love we had has turned to hate somehow
You are my first, and that's why it hurts
The fire that burns, it ain't never gonna die
Naw, it ain't never gonna die
It ain't never gonna die
You are my first, and that's why it hurts
The fire that burns, it ain't never gonna die

[Intro]
Oh yeah

[Verse 1]
They say a lady's not supposed to be saying the shit that she got on her mind
But I do what I feel like
You're who I'm craving, let's start misbehaving, there's no need for you to be shy
You should do it if it feels right

[Pre-Chorus]
Ain't nothing to complicate
I need you to concentrate
My body's the only thing to figure out
Been saving this love for you
I'm ready when you come through
You know we ain't got no time for slowing down
So

[Chorus]
If you keep up
You're the only one, the only one
Don't you ease up
Baby, you know, you know that you got my permission
If you keep up
You're the only one, the only one
Don't you freeze up
Baby, you know, you know that you got my permission

[Verse 2]
It's not an option, no proceed with caution, my heart's beating crazy inside
I get a rush when you touch me, oh yeah
Can't wait to touch, come work under pressure, I want you to take me tonight
And then again if you're lucky, yeah, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
Ain't nothing to complicate 
I need you to concentrate
My body's the only thing to figure out 
Been saving this love for you
I'm ready when you come through 
You know we ain't got no time for slowing down
So

[Chorus]
If you keep up
You're the only one, the only one
Don't you ease up
Baby, you know, you know that you got my permission
If you keep up
You're the only one, the only one 
Don't you freeze up
Baby, you know, you know that you got my permission 

[Post-Chorus]

[Post-Chorus]
You got my permission, and all my attention

You got my permission, to start the ignition

You got my permission, and all my attention

You got my permission , to start the ignition
[Verse 1]
It ain't my fault you keep turnin' me on
It ain't my fault you got, got me so gone
It ain't my fault I'm not leavin' alone
It ain't my fault you keep turnin' me on

[Pre-Chorus 1]
I can't talk right now
I'm lookin' and I like what I'm seein'
Got me feelin' kinda shocked right now
Couldn't stop right now
Even if I wanted, gotta get it, get it, get it, when it's hot right now
Oh my god, what is this?
Want you all in my business
Baby, I insist
Please don't blame me for what ever happens next

[Chorus]
No, I-I-I-I can't be responsible
If I-I-I-I get you in trouble now
See, you're-'re-'re-'re too irresistible
Yeah, that's for sure
So if I put your hands where my eyes can't see
Then you're the one who's got to hold on me
No, I-I-I-I can't be responsible, responsible
It ain't my fault

[Verse 2]
It ain't my fault you came in lookin' like that
You just made me trip, fall, and land on your lap
Certain bad boy smooth
Body hotter than a sun
I don't mean to be rude, but I'd look so damn good on ya

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Ain't got time right now
Missed me with that
"What's your name, your sign" right now
It's light outside
I just called an Uber and it's right outside
Oh my god, what is this?
Want you all in my business
Baby, I insist
Please don't blame me for whatever happens next

[Chorus]
No, I-I-I-I can't be responsible
If I-I-I-I get you in trouble now
See, you're-'re-'re-'re too irresistible
Yeah, that's for sure
So if I put your hands where my eyes can't see
Then you're the one who's got to hold on me
No, I-I-I-I can't be responsible, responsible
It ain't my fault

[Outro]
It ain't my fault

[Verse 1]
I'm a villain and a beast
A monster underneath your sheets
'Cause I'm not exactly who you think I am
I'm a giant and a ghost
I disappear before you know
But tonight I'm gonna hold you in my hands
I don't want you scared at all
Analyzing when we talk
So my lips have sealed the way I feel inside

[Pre-Hook]
'Cause what's done is done
Isn't done yet
Nothing's imminent
But I think about it every minute
Of everyday
Of everyday
Enough's enough
But I'm not giving in, yeah
Even if it sends him over the edge

[Hook 1]
'Cause everybody has a dark side
And I'm across
Never meant to be the bad guy
But now I'm lost
Now I don't wanna waste your time
Or piss you off
'Cause everybody has a dark side

[Verse 2]
I'm the devil and I'm cursed
It feels like every moment's worse
I would sell my soul to make this go away
There's a good to every bad
Here's the thing, now understand
I believe that we can make a change

[Pre-Hook]
What's done is done
Isn't done yet
Nothing's imminent
But I think about it every minute
Of everyday
Of everyday
Enough's enough
No I'm not giving in, yeah
Even if it sends him over the edge

[Hook 1]
'Cause everbody has a dark side
And I'm across
Never meant to be the bad guy
But now I'm lost
Now I don't wanna waste your time
Or piss you off
'Cause everybody has a dark side

[Hook 2]
Before we need a second chance
There's the one we have
But I know that you and I are pulling away
Everybody has a dark side
Everybody has a dark side

[Bridge]
Oh
I don't wanna end this on a low
I only wanna fix it 'cause it's broke
I don't wanna take one for the road
'Cause we'll make us whole

[Hook 1]
Everbody has a dark side
And I'm across
Never meant to be the bad guy
But now I'm lost
Now I don't wanna waste your time
Or piss you off
'Cause everybody has a dark side

[Hook 2]
Before we need a second chance
There's the one we have
But I know that you and I are pulling away
Everybody has a dark side
Everybody has a dark side

[Intro: Zara Larsson]
Oh my, oh my, oh my
Oh my, oh my, oh my
Oh my, oh my, oh my, oh my

[Verse 1: Zara Larsson]
It ain't my fault you keep turnin' me on
It ain't my fault you got, got me so gone
It ain't my fault I'm not leavin' alone
It ain't my fault you keep turnin' me on

[Verse 2: J HUS + Zara Larsson]
Yeah
Hustler, baby
You sing something 
Came looking like a rockstar
Leave the club with a popstar
Girl, had to take a second glance
Why you got two left feet?
You can't do my dance 
Mash up the dancefloor 
Pour this juice on the floor 
Have to be an outlaw 
You know what, I'm not sure
I fell in love with Zara Larsson
Sorry, beg your pardon
I'm a different kind of person
He's the phony version
She loves my East London accent
I made ugly the new fashion
Cashmere, DaVinci
I don't know how it happened 
Mash up the dancefloor 
Pour this juice on the floor 
Have to be an outlaw 
You know what, I'm not sure

[Verse 3: Zara Larsson]
It ain't my fault you came here lookin' like that
You just made me trip, fall, and land on your lap
Certain bad boy smooth
Body hotter than a summer
I don't mean to be rude, but I'd look so damn good on ya
Ain't got time right now
Missed me with that
"What's your name, your sign" right now
It's light outside
I just called an Uber and it's right outside
Oh my god, what is this?
Want you all in my business
Baby, I insist
Please don't blame me for what ever happens next

[Bridge: J HUS + Zara Larsson]
Mash up the dancefloor 
Pour this juice on the floor 
Have to be an outlaw 
You know what, I'm not sure

[Breakdown: Zara Larsson + J HUS]
Oh my, oh my, oh my, oh my
Even if I, oh my, ain't my
Oh my, oh my, oh my
Even if I, even if, oh my, oh my
Oh my, oh my, oh my, oh my
Even if I, oh my, ain't my
Oh my, oh my, oh my
Even if I, even if
It ain't my fault
 Oh my, oh my, oh my, oh my
 Even if I, oh my, ain't my
Oh my, oh my, oh my
 Even if I, even if, oh my, oh my
 Oh my, oh my, oh my, oh my
 Even if I, oh my, ain't my
 Oh my, oh my, oh my
Even if I, even if it ain't my fault

[Bridge: J HUS + Zara Larsson]
 Mash up the dancefloor
 Pour this juice on the floor
 Have to be an outlaw
 You know what, I'm not sure 
 Mash up the dancefloor 
 Pour this juice on the floor 
 Have to be an outlaw 
You know what, I'm not sure

[Verse 1]
Every minute, on and off
Stay together, call it off
Are you in it?
Are you lost?
Every second, hot and cold
We together? No, we're not
Now you see me
Now you don't

[Pre-Chorus]
Always this push, pull, push, pull, push
But there's no rush, no rush, no rush
Always this push, pull, push, pull, push
But there's no rush, no rush, no rush

[Chorus]
And you coulda walked away, baby
But you keep on comin' back to me
And I coulda walked away so easy
But there's something that just made me stay
Always this push, pull, push, pull, push
But there's no rush, no rush, no rush

[Verse 2]
Wait a minute, let it out
It's a rollercoaster ride
First we're loving, then we fight
Wait a second, let me down
Walked away, right back around
Will we ever make up our minds?

[Pre-Chorus]
Always this push, pull, push, pull, push
But there's no rush, no rush, no rush
Always this push, pull, push, pull, push
But there's no rush, no rush, no rush

[Chorus]
And you coulda walked away, baby
But you keep on comin' back to me
And I coulda walked away so easy
But there's something that just made me stay
Always this push, pull, push, pull, push
But there's no rush, no rush, no rush

[Bridge]
So take a good look at me now
Yeah, look at me, look at me now, yeah
So take a good look at me now, baby
Yeah, look at me, look at me now
Yeah-yeah, ooh, yeah
Baby, yeah

[Chorus]
And you coulda walked away, baby
But you keep on comin' back to me 
And I coulda walked away so easy
But there's something that just made me stay

Always this push, pull, push, pull, push
But there's no rush, no rush, no rush
Always this push, pull, push, pull, push
But there's no rush, no rush, no rush

[Verse 1]
She doesn't love you, like I do
She doesn't have my name
How ever she tries, to act like it
She'll never be the same
But she's new, she's beautiful
You've never been in a fight
Oh yeah, it's awfully perfect now
But you just know deep inside

[Chorus]
She's not me
She's not me
She's not me
Baby, she's not me

[Verse 2]
Does she make you feel wanted, like I did?
Make you feel like you're the one thing that matters?
You let her head rest on your chest
But when you close your eyes
You'll be seeing my face again
I'll be crossing your mind
You'll be dreaming of places we went
And then you'll wake up to find

[Chorus]
That she's not me
She's not me
She's not me
Remember, that she's not me, yeah

[Outro]
Mmh, ooh yeah
She's not me
She's not me

[Verse 1: Zara Larsson]
I don't wanna shower even if I stink
'Cause I don't wanna wash you off, wash you off my skin
It's been about an hour
And I'm still tremblin', oh
Feelin' you deep, feelin' you deep within
Eh-eh-eh, yeah-eh-eh

[Pre-Chorus 1: Nena]
Opened bottles on the drawer
Rollin' papers on the floor
Eh, don't want a cigarette yet
Don't want no drink on my breath, yes
Wanna taste your taste some more
Feel you pourin' through my pores
Eh, I'm goin' back in my bed to play it back in my head

[Chorus: Zara Larsson & Nena]
'Cause I can't love nobody like I love myself
Like I love myself, only you, aye
No one's ever touched me like I touch myself
No, nobody else, only you, only you
Only you

[Verse 2: Zara Larsson]
I feel you in my fingers, even in my toes
Steam upon the mirror and on the windows
Baby, that was it
Wish it would never end
I just wanna do it, do it again
Eh-eh-eh, yeah-eh-eh

[Pre-Chorus 2: Nena]
I can smell your smell, so sweet
On my pillow, on my sheets
Eh, I wanna keep it like that
Keep on sleepin' like that, yeah
Baby, you'll be hard to beat
What I have is yours to keep
Eh, I never wanted so bad, best that I ever had

[Chorus: Zara Larsson & Nena]
No, I can't love nobody like I love myself
Oh, like I love myself, only you, oh
No one's ever touched me like I touch myself
No, nobody else, only you, only you

[Bridge: Zara Larsson & Nena]
Only you
Only you
Only you
Oh-oh-oh-oh

[Chorus: Zara Larsson & Nena]
I can't love nobody like I love myself
Like I love myself, only you, only you
No one's ever touched me like I touch myself
No, nobody else 
Only you 

[Verse 1]
I've seen the world, done it all
Had my cake now
Diamonds, brilliant, and Bel Air now
Hot summer nights, mid-July
When you and I were forever wild
The crazy days, city lights
The way you'd play with me like a child

[Chorus]
Will you still love me when I'm no longer young and beautiful?
Will you still love me when I got nothing but my aching soul?
I know you will, I know you will, I know that you will
Will you still love me when I'm no longer beautiful?

[Verse 2]
I've seen the world, lit it up as my stage now
Channeling angels in the new age now
Hot summer days, rock and roll
The way you'd play for me at your show
And all the ways I got to know
Your pretty face and electric soul

[Chorus]
Will you still love me when I'm no longer young and beautiful?
Will you still love me when I got nothing but my aching soul?
I know you will, I know you will, I know that you will
Will you still love me when I'm no longer beautiful?

[Bridge]
Dear Lord, when I get to heaven
Please, let me bring my man
When he comes, tell me that You'll let him in
Father, tell me if You can
All that grace, all that body
All that face makes me wanna party
He's my sun, he makes me shine like diamonds

[Chorus]
Will you still love me when I'm no longer young and beautiful?
Will you still love me when I got nothin' but my aching soul?
I know you will, I know you will, I know that you will
Will you still love me when I'm no longer beautiful?

[Outro]
Will you still love me when I'm no longer beautiful?
Will you still love me when I'm not young and beautiful?

[Verse 1]
Look at you, kids, with your vintage music
Comin' through satellites while cruisin'
You're part of the past, but now you're the future
Signals crossing can get confusin'

[Pre-Chorus]
It's enough just to make you feel crazy, crazy, crazy
Sometimes it's enough just to make you feel crazy

[Chorus]
You get ready, you get all dressed up
To go nowhere in particular
Back to work or the coffee shop
Doesn't matter 'cause it's enough
To be young and in love, ah, ah
To be young and in love, ah, ah

[Verse 2]
Look at you, kids, you know you're the coolest
The world is yours and you can't refuse it
Seen so much, you could get the blues, but
That don't mean that you should abuse it

[Pre-Chorus]
Though it's enough just to make you go crazy, crazy, crazy
I know, it's enough just to make you go crazy, crazy, crazy

[Chorus]
But you get ready, you get all dressed up
To go nowhere in particular
Back to work or the coffee shop
It don't matter because it's enough
To be young and in love, ah, ah
To be young and in love, ah, ah

[Bridge]
Hmm 
Hmm 
Hmm
Don't worry, baby
Hmm 
Hmm 
Hmm
Don't worry, baby

[Pre-Chorus]
And it's enough just to make me go crazy, crazy, crazy
It's enough just to make me go crazy, crazy, crazy

[Chorus]
I get ready, I get all dressed up
To go nowhere in particular
It doesn't matter if I'm not enough
For the future or the things to come
'Cause I'm young and in love, ah, ah
I'm young and in love, ah, ah, ah, ah

[Outro]
Hmm 
Hmm 
Hmm
Don't worry, baby
Hmm 
Hmm 
Hmm
Don't worry, baby

[Chorus]
Kiss me hard before you go
Summertime sadness
I just wanted you to know
That, baby, you're the best

[Verse 1]
I got my red dress on tonight
Dancin' in the dark in the pale moonlight
Done my hair up real big, beauty queen style
High heels off, I'm feelin' alive

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, my God, I feel it in the air
Telephone wires above are sizzlin' like a snare
Honey, I'm on fire, I feel it everywhere
Nothin' scares me anymore
One, two, three, four

[Chorus]
Kiss me hard before you go
Summertime sadness
I just wanted you to know
That, baby, you're the best

[Post-Chorus]
I got that summertime, summertime sadness
Su-su-summertime, summertime sadness
Got that summertime, summertime sadness
Oh, oh-oh-oh-oh

[Verse 2]
I'm feelin' electric tonight
Cruisin' down the coast goin' 'bout 99
Got my bad baby by my heavenly side
I know if I go, I'll die happy tonight

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, my God, I feel it in the air
Telephone wires above are sizzlin' like a snare
Honey, I'm on fire, I feel it everywhere
Nothin' scares me anymore
One, two, three, four

[Chorus]
Kiss me hard before you go
Summertime sadness
I just wanted you to know
That baby, you're the best

[Post-Chorus]
I got that summertime, summertime sadness
Su-su-summertime, summertime sadness
Got that summertime, summertime sadness
Oh, oh-oh-oh-oh

[Bridge]
Think I'll miss you forever
Like the stars miss the sun in the mornin' sky
Later's better than never
Even if you're gone, I'm gonna drive, drive, drive

[Post-Chorus]
I got that summertime, summertime sadness
Su-su-summertime, summertime sadness
Got that summertime, summertime sadness
Oh, oh-oh-oh-oh

[Chorus]
Kiss me hard before you go
Summertime sadness
I just wanted you to know
That, baby, you're the best

[Post-Chorus]
I got that summertime, summertime sadness
Su-su-summertime, summertime sadness
Got that summertime, summertime sadness
Oh, oh-oh-oh-oh

[Verse 1: Lana Del Rey]
Climb up the H of the Hollywood sign, yeah
In these stolen moments
The world is mine 
There's nobody here, just us together 
Keepin' me hot like July forever

[Refrain 1: Lana Del Rey]
'Cause we're the masters of our own fate
We're the captains of our own souls
There's no way for us to come late
'Cause boy, we're gold; boy, we're gold
And I was like

Too much fun tonight, yeah

And a lust for life, and a lust for life
And a lust for life, and a lust for life
Keeps us alive, keeps us alive
Keeps us alive, keeps us alive
And a lust for life, and a lust for life
And a lust for life, and a lust for life
Keeps us alive, keeps us alive
Keeps us alive, keeps us alive

[Verse 2: Lana Del Rey, Lana Del Rey & The Weeknd]
Then, we dance on the H of the Hollywood sign, yeah
'Til we run out of breath, gotta dance 'til we die 
My boyfriend's back
And he's cooler than ever 
There's no more night, blue skies forever

[Refrain 2: The Weeknd]
'Cause we're the masters of our own fate
We're the captains of our own souls
So there's no need for us to hesitate
We're all alone, let's take control
And I was like

[Pre-Chorus: The Weeknd & Lana Del Rey]
Take off, take off
Take off all your clothes
Take off, take off

My boyfriend's back and he's cooler than ever
There's no more night, blue skies forever
I told you twice in our love letter
There's no stopping now, green lights forever
And I was like

[Pre-Chorus: Lana Del Rey]
Take off, take off
Take off all your clothes
Take off, take off
Take off all your clothes
Take off, take off

[Intro]
Why? 
Who, me? 
Why? 

[Verse 1]
Feet don't fail me now
Take me to the finish line
Oh, my heart, it breaks every step that I take
But I'm hoping at the gates, they'll tell me that you're mine
Walking through the city streets, is it by mistake or design?
I feel so alone on a Friday night
Can you make it feel like home, if I tell you you're mine?
It's like I told you, honey 

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't make me sad, don't make me cry
Sometimes love is not enough and the road gets tough
I don't know why
Keep making me laugh  Let's go get high
The road is long, we carry on
Try to have fun in the meantime

[Chorus]
Come and take a walk on the wild side
Let me kiss you hard in the pouring rain
You like your girls insane
Choose your last words, this is the last time
'Cause you and I, we were born to die

[Verse 2]
Lost, but now I am found
I can see that once I was blind
I was so confused as a little child
Tried to take what I could get, scared that I couldn't find
All the answers I need

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't make me sad, don't make me cry
Sometimes love is not enough and the road gets tough
I don't know why
Keep making me laugh  Let's go get high
The road is long, we carry on
Try to have fun in the meantime

[Chorus]
Come and take a walk on the wild side
Let me kiss you hard in the pouring rain
You like your girls insane
Choose your last words, this is the last time
'Cause you and I, we were born to die
We were born to die
We were born to die

[Bridge]
Come and take a walk on the wild side
Let me kiss you hard in the pouring rain
You like your girls insane

[Pre-Chorus]
So don't make me sad, don't make me cry
Sometimes love is not enough and the road gets tough
I don't know why
Keep making me laugh  Let's go get high
The road is long, we carry on
Try to have fun in the meantime

[Chorus]
Come and take a walk on the wild side
Let me kiss you hard in the pouring rain
You like your girls insane
So choose your last words, this is the last time
'Cause you and I, we were born to die
We were born to die
We were born to die
[Intro]
High-igh-igh-igh
High-igh-igh-igh

[Verse 1]
Boy, look at you, lookin' at me
I know you know how I feel
Lovin' you is hard, bein' here's harder
You take the wheel
I don't wanna do this anymore
It's so surreal
I can't survive
If this is all that's real

[Chorus]
All I wanna do is get high by the beach
Get high by the beach, get high
All I wanna do is get by by the beach
Get by, baby, baby, bye bye
The truth is I never bought into your bullshit
When you would pay tribute to me 'cause I know that
All I wanted to do was get high by the beach
Get high, baby, baby, bye bye

[Verse 2]
Boy, look at you, lookin' at me
I know you don't understand
You could be a bad motherfucker
But that don't make you a man
Now you're just another one of my problems
Because you got out of hand
We won't survive
We're sinkin' into the sand

[Chorus]
All I wanna do is get high by the beach
Get high by the beach, get high
All I wanna do is get by by the beach
Get by baby, baby, bye bye
The truth is I never bought into your bullshit
When you would pay tribute to me 'cause I know that
All I wanted to do was get high by the beach
Get high, baby, baby, bye bye

[Bridge]
Lights, camera, accin
I'll do it on my own
Don't need your money, money
To get me what I want
Lights, camera, accin
I'll do it on my own
Don't need your money, money
To get me what I want

[Chorus]
All I wanna do is get high by the beach
Get high by the beach, get high
All I wanna do is get by by the beach
Get by baby, baby, bye bye
The truth is I never bought into your bullshit
When you would pay tribute to me 'cause I know that
All I wanted to do was get high by the beach
Get high, baby, baby, bye bye

High-igh-igh-igh-igh-igh
High-igh-igh-igh-igh-igh-igh

[Outro]
Anyone can start again
Not through love, but through revenge
Through the fire, we're born again
Peace by vengeance, brings the end
[Verse 1]
Swinging in the backyard, pull up in your fast car
Whistling my name
Open up a beer and you say, "Get over here"
And play a video game
I'm in his favorite sundress, watching me get undressed
Take that body downtown
I say, "You da bestest," lean in for a big kiss
Put his favorite perfume on
"Go play your video game"

[Chorus]
It's you, it's you, it's all for you
Everything I do
I tell you all the time
Heaven is a place on Earth with you
Tell me all the things you wanna do
I heard that you like the bad girls
Honey, is that true?
It's better than I ever even knew
They say that the world was built for two
Only worth living if somebody is loving you
And baby, now you do

[Verse 2]
Singing in the old bars, swinging with the old stars
Living for the fame
Kissing in the blue dark, playing pool and wild darts
Video games
He holds me in his big arms, drunk, and I am seeing stars
This is all I think of
Watching all our friends fall in and out of Old Paul's
This is my idea of fun
Playing video games

[Chorus]
It's you, it's you, it's all for you
Everything I do
I tell you all the time
Heaven is a place on Earth with you
Tell me all the things you wanna do
I heard that you like the bad girls
Honey, is that true?
It's better than I ever even knew
They say that the world was built for two
Only worth living if somebody is loving you
And baby, now you do

[Bridge]



[Chorus]
It's you, it's you, it's all for you
Everything I do
I tell you all the time
Heaven is a place on Earth with you
Tell me all the things you wanna do
I heard that you like the bad girls
Honey, is that true?
It's better than I ever even knew
They say that the world was built for two
Only worth living if somebody is loving you
And baby, now you do

[Outro]

Now you do
[Verse 1]
Love , I said real love is like feelin' no fear
When you're standin' in the face of danger
'Cause you just want it so much
A touch from your real love
Is like heaven takin' the place of somethin' evil
And lettin' it burn off from the rush, yeah, yeah


[Chorus]
Darlin', darlin', darlin'
I fall to pieces when I'm with you, I fall to pieces
My cherries and wine, rosemary and thyme
And all of my peaches are ruined

[Verse 2]
Love, is it real love?
It's like smilin' when the firin' squad's against you
And you just stay lined up, yeah


[Chorus]
Darlin', darlin', darlin'
I fall to pieces when I'm with you, I fall to pieces 
My cherries and wine, rosemary and thyme
And all of my peaches are ruined 

[Bridge]
My rose garden dreams, set on fire by fiends
And all my black beaches are ruined
My celluloid scenes are torn at the seams
And I fall to pieces 
I fall to pieces when I'm with you


[Outro]
'Cause I love you so much, I fall to pieces
My cherries and wine, rosemary and thyme
And all of my peaches are ruined 
Are ruined , are ruined [Produced by Dan Auerbach]

[Verse 1]
Down on the West coast, they got a sayin'
"If you're not drinkin', then you're not playin'"
But you've got the music
You've got the music in you, don't you?
Down on the West coast, I get this feeling like
It all could happen, that's why I'm leaving
You for the moment, you for the moment
Boy Blue, yeah, you

[Pre-Chorus 1]
You're falling hard, I push away, I'm feelin' hot to the touch
You say you miss me and I wanna say I miss you so much
But something keeps me really quiet, I'm alive, I'm a lush
Your love, your love, my love

[Chorus]
I can see my baby swinging
His Parliament's on fire and his hands are up
On the balcony and I'm singing
Ooh baby, ooh baby, I'm in love
I can see my sweet boy swaying
He's crazy y cubano como yo, la-la
On the balcony and I'm saying
Move baby, move baby, I'm in love
I'm in love 
I'm in love 

[Interlude]
Mic-check
One, two
Two
Two
Get it, girl

[Verse 2]
Down on the West coast, they got their icons
Their silver starlets, their Queens of Saigons
And you've got the music
You've got the music in you, don't you?
Down on the West coast, they love their movies
Their golden gods and Rock 'n' Roll groupies
And you've got the music
You've got the music in you, don't you?

[Pre-Chorus 2]
You push it hard, I pull away, I'm feeling hotter than fire
I guess that no one ever really made me feel that much higher
Te deseo, cario, boy, it's you I desire
Your love, your love, my love

[Chorus]
I can see my baby swinging
His Parliament's on fire and his hands are up
On the balcony and I'm singing
Ooh baby, ooh baby, I'm in love
I can see my sweet boy swaying
He's crazy y cubano como yo, la-la
On the balcony and I'm saying
Move baby, move baby, I'm in love

[Chorus]
I can see my baby swinging
His Parliament's on fire and his hands are up
On the balcony and I'm singing
Ooh baby, ooh baby, I'm in love
I can see my sweet boy swaying
He's crazy y cubano como yo, la-la
On the balcony and I'm saying
Move baby, move baby, I'm in love

[Outro]
I'm in love
I'm in love

[Verse 1]
Goddamn, man-child
You fucked me so good that I almost said "I love you"
You're fun and youre wild
But you don't know the half of the shit that you put me through
Your poetry's bad and you blame the news
But I cant change that, and I can't change your mood, ah

[Chorus]
'Cause you're just a man
It's just what you do
Your head in your hands
As you color me blue
Yeah, you're just a man
All through and through
Your head in your hands
As you color me blue
Blue, blue, blue

[Verse 2]
Goddamn, man-child
You act like a kid even though you stand six foot two
Self-loathing poet, resident Laurel Canyon know-it-all
You talk to the walls when the party gets bored of you
But I don't get bored, I just see it through
Why wait for the best when I could have you? You?

[Chorus]
'Cause youre just a man
Its just what you do
Your head in your hands
As you color me blue
Yeah, you're just a man
All through and through
Your head in your hands
As you color me blue
Blue, blue
You make me blue

[Outro]
Blue, blue
Blue, blue, blue
Blue, blue, blue

[Verse 1]
I was reading Slim Aarons and I got to thinking that I thought
Maybe I'd get less stressed if I was tested less like
All of these debutantes
Smiling for miles in pink dresses and high heels on white yachts
But I'm not, baby, I'm not
No, I'm not, that, I'm not

[Chorus]
I've been tearing around in my fucking nightgown
24/7 Sylvia Plath
Writing in blood on my walls
'Cause the ink in my pen don't work in my notepad
Don't ask if I'm happy, you know that I'm not
But at best, I can say I'm not sad
'Cause hope is a dangerous thing for a woman like me to have
Hope is a dangerous thing for a woman like me to have

[Verse 2]
I had 15-year dances
Church basement romances, yeah, I've cried
Spilling my guts with the Bowery Bums
Is the only love I've ever known
Except for the stage, which I also call home, when I'm not
Servin' up God in a burnt coffee pot for the triad
Hello, it's the most famous woman you know on the iPad
Calling from beyond the grave, I just wanna say, "Hi, Dad"

[Chorus]
I've been tearing up town in my fucking white gown
Like a goddamn near sociopath
Shaking my ass is the only thing that's
Got this black narcissist off my back
She couldn't care less, and I never cared more
So there's no more to say about that
Except hope is a dangerous thing for a woman like me to have
Hope is a dangerous thing for a woman with my past

[Bridge]
There's a new revolution, a loud evolution that I saw
Born of confusion and quiet collusion of which mostly I've known
A modern day woman with a weak constitution, 'cause I've got
Monsters still under my bed that I could never fight off
A gatekeeper carelessly dropping the keys on my nights off

[Chorus]
I've been tearing around in my fucking nightgown
24/7 Sylvia Plath
Writing in blood on your walls
'Cause the ink in my pen don't look good in my pad
They write that I'm happy, they know that I'm not
But at best, you can see I'm not sad
But hope is a dangerous thing for a woman like me to have
Hope is a dangerous thing for a woman like me to have

[Outro]
Hope is a dangerous thing for a woman like me to have
But I have it
Yeah, I have it
Yeah, I have it
I have

[Verse 1]
You took my sadness out of context
At the Mariners Apartment Complex
I ain't no candle in the wind
I'm the board, the lightning, the thunder
Kind of girl who's gonna make you wonder
Who you are and who you've been

[Pre-Chorus]
And who I've been is with you on these beaches
Your Venice bitch, your die-hard, your weakness
Maybe I could save you from your sins
So kiss the sky and whisper to Jesus
My, my, my, you found this, you need this
Take a deep breath, baby, let me in

[Chorus]
You lose your way, just take my hand
You're lost at sea, then I'll command your boat to me again
Don't look too far, right where you are, that's where I am
I'm your man
I'm your man

[Verse 2]
They mistook my kindness for weakness
I fucked up, I know that, but Jesus
Can't a girl just do the best she can?
Catch a wave and take in the sweetness
Think about it, the darkness, the deepness
All the things that make me who I am

[Pre-Chorus]
And who I am is a big-time believer
That people can change, but you don't have to leave her
When everyone's talking, you can make a stand
'Cause even in the dark, I feel your resistance
You can see my heart burning in the distance
Baby, baby, baby, I'm your man 

[Chorus]
You lose your way, just take my hand
You're lost at sea, then I'll command your boat to me again
Don't look too far, right where you are, that's where I am
I'm your man
I'm your man

[Outro]
Catch a wave and take in the sweetness
Take in the sweetness
You want this, you need this
Are you ready for it?
Are you ready for it?
Are you ready for it?

[Verse 1]
Fear fun, fear love
Fresh out of fucks forever
Tryin' to be stronger for you
Ice cream, ice queen
I dream in jeans and leather
Live stream, I'm sweet for you

[Chorus]
Oh God, miss you on my lips
It's me, your little Venice bitch
On the stoop with the neighborhood kids
Callin' out, bang bang, kiss kiss

[Post-Chorus]
You're in the yard, I light the fire
And as the summer fades away
Nothing gold can stay
You write, I tour, we make it work
You're beautiful and I'm insane
We're American-made

[Verse 2]
Give me Hallmark
One dream, one life, one lover
Paint me happy in blue
Norman Rockwell
No hype under our covers
It's just me and you

[Chorus]
Oh God, miss you on my lips
It's me, your little Venice bitch
On the stoop with the neighborhood kids
Callin' out, bang bang, kiss kiss

[Post-Chorus]
You're in the yard, I light the fire
And as the summer fades away
Nothing gold can stay
You write, I tour, we make it work
You're beautiful and I'm insane
We're American-made

[Refrain]
Oh , oh , oh 
Soundin' off, bang bang, kiss kiss
Oh , oh , oh 
Soundin' off, bang bang, kiss kiss

[Chorus]
Oh God, want you on my lips 
It's me, your little Venice bitch 
On the stoop with the neighborhood kids
Soundin' off, bang bang, kiss kiss

[Refrain]
Oh, shatter , oh, shatter , oh, shatter 

Yeah , oh , oh 

Yeah, yeah

[Verse 3]
You heard my baby's back in town now
You should come, come over
We'll be hanging around now
You should come, come over

[Chorus]
Oh God, I love him on my lips
It's me, your little Venice bitch
Touch me with your fingertips
It's me, your little Venice bitch

[Verse 4]
Back, back in the garden
We're getting high now because we're older
Me myself, I like diamonds
My baby, crimson and clover

[Bridge]


Wha-wha-wha-wha-whatever
Everything, whatever
Wha-wha-wha-wha-whatever
Everything, whatever

[Guitar Solo]

[Bridge]
Ah, ah, ah, ah
Ah yeah, ah yeah

Ah yeah, ah

La-la-la-la-la-la, losers,  beautiful losers 
La-la-la-la-la-la, losers,  beautiful losers 
La-la-la-la-la-la, losers, beautiful losers
La-la-la-la-la-la, losers, beautiful losers

[Verse 4]
Back in the garden
We're getting high now because we're older
Me myself, I like diamonds
My baby, crimson and clover

[Bridge]
Crimson and clover, honey
Crimson and clover, honey

Crimson and clover, honey
Crimson and clover, honey
Over and over, honey

[Outro]
If you weren't mine, I'd be
Jealous of your love
If you weren't mine, I'd be
Jealous of your love
If you weren't mine, I'd be
Jealous of your love
If you weren't mine, I'd be
Jealous of your love
If you weren't mine, I'd be
Jealous of your love

[Verse 1]
He used to call me DN
That stood for Deadly Nightshade
'Cause I was filled with poison
But blessed with beauty and rage
Jim told me that, he hit me and it felt like a kiss
Jim brought me back, reminded me of when we were kids

[Chorus]
With his ultraviolence
Ultraviolence
Ultraviolence
Ultraviolence
I can hear sirens, sirens
He hit me and it felt like a kiss
I can hear violins, violins
Give me all of that ultraviolence

[Verse 2]
He used to call me poison
Like I was Poison Ivy
I could have died right there
'Cause he was right beside me
Jim raised me up, he hurt me but it felt like true love
Jim taught me that, loving him was never enough

[Chorus]
With his ultraviolence
Ultraviolence
Ultraviolence
Ultraviolence
I can hear sirens, sirens
He hit me and it felt like a kiss
I can hear violins, violins
Give me all of that ultraviolence

[Bridge]
We could go back to New York
Loving you was really hard
We could go back to Woodstock
Where they don't know who we are
Heaven is on Earth
I would do anything for you, baby
Blessed is this union
Crying tears of gold like lemonade

[Interlude]
I love you the first time, I love you the last time
Yo soy la princesa, comprende mis white lines
'Cause I'm your jazz singer and you're my cult leader
I love you forever, I love you forever

[Chorus]
With his ultraviolence 
Ultraviolence 
Ultraviolence 
Ultraviolence 
I can hear sirens, sirens
He hit me and it felt like a kiss
I can hear violins, violins
Give me all of that ultraviolence

[Verse 1]
Darling, darling
Doesn't have a problem lying to herself
'Cause her liquor's top shelf
It's alarming, honestly, how charming she can be
Fooling everyone, telling hon she's having fun

[Pre-Chorus]
She says, "You don't want to be like me
Don't wanna see all the things I've seen"
I'm dying, I'm dying
She says, "You don't want to get this way
Famous and dumb at an early age"
Lying, I'm lying

[Chorus]
The boys, the girls
They all like Carmen
She gives them butterflies, bats her cartoon eyes
She laughs like God
Her mind's like a diamond
Audiotune lies
She's still shining
Like lightning, woah
Like lightning

[Verse 2]
Carmen, Carmen
Staying up till morning
Only seventeen, but she walks the streets so mean
It's alarming, truly, how disarming you can be
Eating soft ice cream
Coney Island queen

[Pre-Chorus]
She says, "You don't want to be like me
Looking for fun, getting high for free"
I'm dying, I'm dying
She says, "You don't want to get this way
Street walk at night, and a star by day"
It's tiring, tiring

[Chorus]
The boys, the girls
They all like Carmen
She gives them butterflies, bats her cartoon eyes
She laughs like God
Her mind's like a diamond
Audiotune lies
She's still shining
Like lightning, woah
Like lightning

[Bridge]
Baby's all dressed up, with nowhere to go
That's the little story of the girl you know
Relying on the kindness of strangers
Tying cherry knots
Smiling, doing party favours
Put your red dress on, put your lipstick on
Sing your song, song, now the camera's on
And you're alive again

[Interlude]
Mon amour, je sais que tu m'aimes aussi
Tu as besoin de moi, tu as besoin de moi dans ta vie
Tu ne peux vivre sans moi
Et je mourrais sans toi
Je tuerais pour toi

[Chorus]
The boys, the girls
They all like Carmen
She gives them butterflies, bats her cartoon eyes
She laughs like God
Her mind's like a diamond
Audiotune lies
She's still shining
Like lightning, woah
Like lightning

[Outro]
Like lightning, woah
Like lightning
Darling, darling
Doesn't have a problem lying to herself
Cause her liquor's top shelf

[Verse 1: Lana Del Rey, Playboi Carti & A$AP Rocky]
It's never too late
To be who you wanna be

To say what you wanna say
Tattoo on my face, swimmin' in my safe
Tattoo on my face, swimmin' in my safe
It's never too late
To leave if you wanna leave 
Or to stay if you wanna stay
But, baby 
I got a feelin' in my bones
Tattoo on my face, swimmin' in my safe
Can't get you out of my veins 
You can't escape my affection 
Wrap you up in my daisy chains 

[Chorus: Lana Del Rey, Playboi Carti & A$AP Rocky]
Hip-hop in the summer 
Don't be a bummer, babe 
Be my undercover lover, babe, hmm
(What? What? What? What? What? What? Yeah
What? What? What?)
High tops in the summer 
Don't be a bummer, babe 
Be my undercover lover, babe, hmm 

[Verse 2: A$AP Rocky & Playboi Carti]
Uh, her sophistication makes you wanna quit the bitch you datin'
Let's skip the games, let's quit the playin'
Boo, let's get acquainted 
Notifications sync in place even when we're on vacation 
I knew she'd notice like I missed the payment, dang it 
But bang it like my fingers 
She pray to God I made it 
But bankin' like my Franklins 
My neighbors stopped the hatin' 
What? 
Huh? 
Slide inside it 
Diddy Boppin'  
Milly Rockin' 
She just might become my lover for real 
I might fuck with her all summer for real 
They better not holla if I cuff her for real 
Niggas better run for cover for real
Goin' bell how I feel, close the deal, pop a seal
Take the whip, two pills on the lips on the real 
Truthfully, between you and me, I'm usually single
When it's hot outside this, I ride through any hood with the top out
Hop out

[Chorus: Lana Del Rey, Playboi Carti & A$AP Rocky]
Hip-hop in the summer 
Don't be a bummer, babe 
Be my undercover lover, babe, hmm
(What? What? What? What? What? What? Yeah
What? What? What?)
High tops in the summer 
Don't be a bummer, babe 
Be my undercover lover, babe, hmm 

[Verse 3: Lana Del Rey]
White lies and black beaches
Miles in between us
Is this love or lust or some game on repeat?
It's like makin' me crazy
Tell me, "have patience"
Baby, I need this
White lines and black beaches
White lies and black beaches
And blood red sangrias
We traveled for weeks, just to escape your demons
But you've got your reasons
In makin' me crazy
But you've got your reasons
White lights and black beaches

[Bridge: Lana Del Rey & A$AP Rocky]
High tops in the summer 
Don't be a bummer, babe 
Don't be a bummer 
Don't be a bummer 

[Chorus: Lana Del Rey, Playboi Carti & A$AP Rocky]
Hip-hop in the summer 
Don't be a bummer, babe 
Be my undercover lover, babe, hmm
(What? What? What? What? What? What? Yeah
What? What? What?)
High tops in the summer 
Don't be a bummer, babe 
Be my undercover lover, babe 

[Outro: Lana Del Rey]
Don't be a bummer, babe
Ooh ohh, ooh ohh
Ooh ohh, ooh ohh[Produced by Emile Haynie & Patrik Berger]

[Verse 1]
My old man is a bad man
But I can't deny the way he holds my hand
And he grabs me, he has me by my heart
He doesn't mind I have a Las Vegas past
He doesn't mind I have a L.A. crass way about me
He loves me with every beat of his cocaine heart

[Refrain]
Swimming pool, glimmering darling
White bikini off with my red nail polish
Watch me in the swimming pool
Bright blue ripples
You sittin', sippin' on your Black Cristal
Oh yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
Light of my life, fire of my loins
Be a good baby, do what I want
Light of my life, fire of my loins
Gimme them gold coins
Gimme them coins

[Chorus 1]
And I'm off to the races
Cases of Bacardi chasers
Chasing me all over town
'Cause he knows I'm wasted
Facing time again at Rikers Island
And I won't get out
Because I'm crazy, baby
I need you to come here and save me
I'm your little scarlet, starlet
Singing in the garden
Kiss me on my open mouth
Ready for you

[Verse 2]
My old man is a tough man
But he got a soul as sweet as blood red jam
And he shows me, he knows me, every inch of my tar black soul
He doesn't mind I have a flat, broke-down life
In fact, he says he thinks it's what he might like about me
Admires me, the way I roll like a rollin' stone

[Refrain]
Likes to watch me in the glass room, bathroom
Chateau Marmont, slippin' on my red dress, puttin' on my makeup
Glass room, perfume, cognac, lilac fumes
Says it feels like heaven to him

[Pre-Chorus]
Light of his life, fire of his loins
Keep me forever, tell me you own me
Light of your life, fire of your loins
Tell me you own me
Gimme them coins

[Chorus 1]
And I'm off to the races
Cases of Bacardi chasers
Chasing me all over town
'Cause he knows I'm wasted
Facing time again at Rikers Island
And I won't get out
Because I'm crazy, baby
I need you to come here and save me
I'm your little scarlet, starlet
Singing in the garden
Kiss me on my open mouth

[Chorus 2]
Yo, I'm off to the races, laces
Leather on my waist is tight and I am falling down
I can see your face is shameless
Cipriani's basement
Love you, but I'm going down
God, I'm so crazy, baby
I'm sorry that I'm misbehaving
I'm your little harlot, starlet
Queen of Coney Island
Raising hell all over town
Sorry 'bout it

[Bridge]
My old man is a thief
And I'm gonna stay and pray with him 'til the end
But I trust in the decision of the Lord
To watch over us
Take him when He may, if He may
I'm not afraid to say that I'd die without him
Who else is gonna put up with me this way?
I need you, I breathe you, I'd never leave you
They would rue the day I was alone without you
You're lying with your gold chain on
Cigar hanging from your lips
I said, "Hon', you never looked so beautiful
As you do now, my man"

[Chorus 3]
And we're off to the races, places
Ready, set, the gate is down and now we're goin' in
To Las Vegas, chaos, Casino Oasis
Honey, it is time to spin
Boy, you're so crazy, baby
I love you forever, not maybe
You are my one true love
You are my one true love

[Outro]
You are my one true love

[Chorus]
Summertime, and the livin's easy
Bradley's on the microphone with Ras MG
All the people in the dance will agree
That we're well-qualified to represent the L.B.C.
Me, me and Louie, we gonna run to the party
And dance to the rhythm, it gets harder

[Verse 1]
Me and my girl, we got this relationship
I love her so bad, but she treats me like shit
On lockdown, like a penitentiary
She spreads her lovin' all over
And when she gets home, there's none left for me

[Chorus]
Summertime, and the livin's easy
Bradley's on the microphone with Ras MG
All the people in the dance will agree
That we're well-qualified to represent the L.B.C.
Me, me and Louie, we gonna run to the party
And dance to the rhythm, it gets harder


[Verse 2]
Oh, take this veil from off my eyes
My burning sun will, some day, rise
So, what am I gonna be doin' for a while?
Said, I'm gonna play with myself
Show them how we come off the shelf

[Chorus]
Summertime, and the livin's easy
Bradley's on the microphone with Ras MG
All the people in the dance will agree
That we're well-qualified to represent the L.B.C.
Me, me and Louie, we gonna run to the party
And dance to the rhythm, it gets harder


[Bridge]
Evil, we've come to tell you that she's evil, most definitely
Evil, ornery, scandalous and evil, most definitely
The tension, it's getting hotter
I'd like to hold her head underwater



[Chorus]
Summertime, and the livin's easy
Bradley's on the microphone with Ras MG
All the people in the dance will agree
That we're well-qualified to represent the L.B.C.
Me, me and Louie, we gonna run to the party
And dance to the rhythm, it gets harder[Video Prelude]

[Intro]
Money is the anthem of success
So before we go out, what's your address?

[Verse 1]
I'm your national anthem, God, you're so handsome
Take me to the Hamptons, Bugatti Veyron
He loves to romance 'em, reckless abandon
Holding me for ransom, upper echelon
He says to be cool, but I don't know how yet
Wind in my hair, hand on the back of my neck
I said, "Can we party later on?", he said, "Yes, yes, yes"

[Chorus]
Tell me I'm your national anthem

Tell me I'm your national anthem

Red, white, blue is in the sky
Summer's in the air and, baby, heaven's in your eyes
I'm your national anthem

[Refrain 1]
Money is the reason we exist
Everybody knows it, it's a fact
Kiss, kiss

[Verse 2]
I sing the national anthem
While I'm standing over your body, hold you like a python
And you can't keep your hands off me or your pants on
See what you've done to me, King of Chevron?
He said to be cool, but I'm already coolest
I said to get real, don't you know who you're dealing with?
Um, do you think you'll buy me lots of diamonds?


[Chorus]
Tell me I'm your national anthem

Tell me I'm your national anthem

Red, white, blue is in the sky
Summer's in the air and, baby, heaven's in your eyes
I'm your national anthem

[Bridge]
It's a love story for the new age, for the sixth page
We're on a quick, sick rampage
Wining and dining, drinking and driving
Excessive buying, overdose and dying
On our drugs, and our love, and our dreams, and our rage
Blurring the lines between real and the fake
Dark and lonely, I need somebody to hold me
He will do very well, I can tell, I can tell
Keep me safe in his belltower hotel

[Refrain 2]
Money is the anthem of success
So put on mascara and your party dress

[Verse 3]
I'm your national anthem
Boy, put your hands up, give me a standing ovation
Boy, you have landed
Babe, in the land of sweetness and danger, Queen of Saigon

[Chorus]
Tell me I'm your national anthem

Tell me I'm your national anthem

Red, white, blue is in the sky
Summer's in the air and, baby, heaven's in your eyes
I'm your national anthem

[Outro]
Money is the anthem
God, you're so handsome
Money is the anthem of success
Money is the anthem
God, you're so handsome
Money is the anthem of success
Money is the anthem
God, you're so handsome
Money is the anthem of success
Money is the anthem
God, you're so handsome
Money is the anthem of success

[Verse 1]
I like to see everything in neon
Drink lime green, stay up 'til dawn
Maybe the way that I'm living is killing me
I like to light up the stage with a song
Do shit to keep me turned on
But one day I woke up like
"Maybe I'll do it differently"

[Pre-Chorus]
So I moved to California but it's just a state of mind
It turns out everywhere you go you take yourself that's not a lie
Wish that you would hold me or just say that you were mine
It's killing me slowly

[Chorus]
Dream a little dream of me
Make me into something sweet
Turn the radio on, dancing to a pop song
Fuck it, I love you
Fuck it I love you
Fuck it, I love you
I really do

[Verse 2]
I used to shoot up my veins in neon
And shit's even brighter; you're gone
So many things I would say to you
I want you

[Pre-Chorus]
You moved to California, but it's just a state of mind
And you know everyone adores you
You can't feel it and you're tired
Baby wish that you would hold me or just say that you were mine
But it's killing me slowly

[Chorus]
Dream a little dream of me
Turn this into something sweet
Turn the radio on, dancing to a pop song
Fuck it, I love you
Fuck it, I love you
Fuck it, I love you
I really do

[Bridge]
It turns out California's more than just a state of mind
I met you on the boulevard, wind through my hair, you blew my mind
And if I wasn't so fucked up, I think I'd fuck you all the time

It's killing me slowly

[Chorus]
Fuck it, I love you 
Fuck it, I love you 
Fuck it, I love you 
I really do 

[Outro]

California dreamin', got my money on my mind

Chances in my veins, running out of time

California dreamin', got my money on my mind

Chances in my veins, running out of time

California dreamin', got my money on my mind

Chances in my veins, running out of time

California dreamin', got my money on my mind

Chances in my veins, running out of time

[Verse 1]
Blue jeans, white shirt
Walked into the room, you know you made my eyes burn
It was like James Dean for sure
You're so fresh to death and sick as ca-cancer
You were sorta punk rock, I grew up on hip hop
You fit me better than my favorite sweater
And I know that love is mean  and love hurts 
But I still remember that day we met in December, oh baby

[Chorus]
I will love you 'til the end of time
I would wait a million years
Promise you'll remember that you're mine
Baby, can you see through the tears?
Love you more than those bitches before
Say you'll remember , say you'll remember
Oh baby, ooh, I will love you 'til the end of time

[Verse 2]
Big dreams, gangsta
Said you had to leave to start your life over
I was like, "No, please, stay here
We don't need no money, we could make it all work"
But he headed out on Sunday, said he'd come home Monday
I stayed up waiting, anticipating and pacing
But he was chasing  paper 
Caught up in the game, that was the last I heard

[Chorus]
I will love you 'til the end of time
I would wait a million years
Promise you'll remember that you're mine
Baby, can you see through the tears?
Love you more than those bitches before
Say you'll remember , say you'll remember
Oh baby, ooh, I will love you 'til the end of time

[Bridge]
You went out every night, and baby, that's alright
I told you that no matter what you did, I'd be by your side
'Cause I'ma ride or die, whether you fail or fly
Well, shit, at least you tried
But when you walked out that door, a piece of me died
Told you I wanted more; that's not what I had in mind
I just want it like before, we were dancing all night
Then they took you away, stole you out of my life
You just need to remember

[Chorus]
I will love you 'til the end of time
I would wait a million years
Promise you'll remember that you're mine
Baby, can you see through the tears?
Love you more than those bitches before
Say you'll remember , say you'll remember
Oh baby, ooh, I will love you 'til the end of time

[Verse 1]
In the car, in the car, in the backseat, I'm your baby
We go fast, we go so fast, we dont move
I believe in a place you take me
Make you real proud of your baby
In your car, I'm a star and I'm burnin through you
In your car, I'm a star and I'm burnin' through you

[Chorus]
Oh, be my once in a lifetime
Lyin' on your chest in my party dress
I'm a fuckin' mess, but I
Oh, thanks for the high life
Baby, it's the best, passed the test and yes
Now Im here with you, and I
Would like to think that you would stick around
You know that Id just die to make you proud
The taste, the touch, the way we love
It all comes down to make the sound of our love song

[Verse 2]
Dream a dream, here's a scene
Touch me anywhere cause I'm your baby
Grab my waist, don't waste any part
I believe that you see me for who I am
So spill my clothes on the floor of your new car
Is it safe, is it safe to just be who we are?
Is it safe, is it safe to just be who we are?

[Chorus]
Oh, be my once in a lifetime
Lyin' on your chest in my party dress
Im a fuckin' mess, but I
Oh, thanks for the high life
Baby, it's the best, passed the test and yes
Now I'm here with you, and I
Would like to think that you would stick around
You know that I'd just die to make you proud
The taste, the touch, the way we love
It all comes down to make the sound of our love song
The taste, the touch, the way we love
It all comes down to make the sound of our love song

[Verse 1]
I've been out on that open road
You can be my full-time daddy, white and gold
Singing blues has been getting old
You can be my full-time baby, hot or cold

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't break me down 
I've been traveling too long 
I've been trying too hard 
With one pretty song 

[Chorus]
I hear the birds on the summer breeze
I drive fast, I am alone at midnight
Been trying hard not to get into trouble
But I, I've got a war in my mind
So, I just ride, just ride
I just ride, I just ride

[Verse 2]
Dying young and playing hard
That's the way my father made his life an art
Drink all day and we talk 'til dark
That's the way the road dogs do it
Light 'til dark

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't leave me now 
Don't say goodbye 
Don't turn around 
Leave me high and dry 

[Chorus]
I hear the birds on the summer breeze
I drive fast, I am alone at midnight
Been trying hard not to get into trouble
But I, I've got a war in my mind
I just ride, just ride
I just ride, I just ride

[Bridge]
I'm tired of feeling like I'm fucking crazy
I'm tired of driving 'til I see stars in my eyes
All I've got to keep myself sane, baby
So I just ride, I just ride

[Chorus]
Hear the birds on the summer breeze
I drive fast, I am alone at midnight
Been trying hard not to get into trouble
But I, I've got a war in my mind
I just ride, just ride
I just ride, I just ride

[Intro]
Ta-da-da-da-da-da-da
Pa-da-da-da-da-da-da
Ta-da-da-da-da-da-da

[Verse 1]
They say I'm too young to love you
I don't know what I need
They think I don't understand
The freedom land of the seventies
I think I'm too cool to know ya
You say I'm like the ice I freeze
I'm churning out novels like
Beat poetry on Amphetamines

[Pre-Chorus 1]
I say
I say

[Chorus]
Well, my boyfriend's in a band
He plays guitar while I sing Lou Reed
I've got feathers in my hair
I get down to Beat poetry
And my jazz collection's rare
I can play most anything
I'm a Brooklyn baby
I'm a Brooklyn baby

[Verse 2]
They say I'm too young to love you
They say I'm too dumb to sing
They judge me like a picture book
By the colors, like they forgot to read
I think we're like fire and water
I think we're like the wind and sea
You're burning up, I'm cooling down
You're up, I'm down
You're blind, I see

[Pre-Chorus 2]
But I'm free
I'm free

[Chorus]
Well, my boyfriend's in a band
He plays guitar while I sing Lou Reed
I've got feathers in my hair
I get down to Beat poetry
And my jazz collection's rare
I can play most anything
I'm a Brooklyn baby
I'm a Brooklyn baby

[Bridge]
I'm talking about my generation
Talking about that newer nation
And if you don't like it
You can beat it
Beat it, baby
You never liked the way I said it
If you don't get it, then forget it
'Cause I don't have to fucking explain it

[Modified-Chorus]
And my boyfriend's in a band
He plays guitar while I sing Lou Reed
I've got feathers in my hair
I get high on hydroponic weed
And my jazz collection's rare
I get down to Beat poetry
I'm a Brooklyn baby
I'm a Brooklyn baby

[Post-Chorus]
Pa-da-pa-pa, pa-de-da
Te-de-de, da-da-ah
Ooh, oh
Woah-ah

[Break]
Yeah, my boyfriend's pretty cool
But he's not as cool as me
'Cause I'm a Brooklyn baby
I'm a Brooklyn baby

[Outro]
Pa-da-da-da-da-da-da
Da-da-da-da-da, baby
Ah-ta-da-da-da-da
Da-da-da-da, baby
Pa-da-da-da-da-da
Pa-pa-da-pa-da, yeah
Yeah, yeah[Pre-Song]
I was in the winter of my life
And the men I met along the road were my only summer
At night I fell asleep with visions of myself dancing and laughing and crying with them
Three years down the line of being on an endless world tour and my memories of them were the only things that sustained me
And my only real happy times

I was a singer
Not a very popular one
I once had dreams of becoming a beautiful poet
But upon an unfortunate series of events saw those dreams dashed and divided like a million stars in the night sky
That I wished on over and over again, sparkling and broken
But I didnt really mind because I knew that it takes getting everything you ever wanted and then losing it to know what true freedom is

When the people I used to know found out what I had been doing how I had been living, they asked me why, but theres no use in talking to people who have a home
They have no idea what its like to seek safety in other people
For home to be wherever you lie your head

I was always an unusual girl
My mother told me that I had a chameleon soul
No moral compass pointing due north
No fixed personality
Just an inner indecisiveness that was as wide and as wavering as the ocean
And if I said I didnt plan for it to turn out this way Id be lying

Because I was born to be the other woman
Who belonged to no one
Who belonged to everyone
Who had nothing
Who wanted everything
With a fire for every experience and an obsession for freedom that terrified me to the point that I couldnt even talk about it
And pushed me to a nomadic point of madness that both dazzled and dizzied me

[Song]

[Post-Song]
Every night I used to pray that Id find my people
And finally I did
On the open road
We had nothing to lose, nothing to gain, nothing we desired anymore
Except to make our lives into a work of art

Live fast
Die young
Be wild
And have fun

I believe in the country America used to be
I believe in the person I want to become
I believe in the freedom of the open road
And my motto is the same as ever
"I believe in the kindness of strangers"

And when I'm at war with myself
I ride
I just ride

Who are you?
Are you in touch with all of your darkest fantasies?
Have you created a life for yourself where you can experience them?

I have
I am fucking crazy
But I am free

[Verse 1]
Cinnamon in my teeth
From your kiss, you're touching me
All the pills that you take
Violet, blue, green, red to keep me at arm's length don't work
You try to push me out, but I just find my way back in
Violet, blue, green, red to keep me out, I win

[Chorus]
There's things I wanna say to you, but I'll just let you live
Like if you hold me without hurting me
You'll be the first who ever did
There's things I wanna talk about, but better not to give
But if you hold me without hurting me
You'll be the first who ever did

[Post-Chorus]
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
Hold me, love me, touch me, honey
Be the first who ever did
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
Hold me, love me, touch me, honey
Be the first who ever did

[Verse 2]
Kerosene in my hands
You make me mad, on fire again
All the pills that you take
Violet, blue, green, red to keep me at arm's length don't work

[Chorus]
There's things I wanna say to you, but I'll just let you live
Like if you hold me without hurting me
You'll be the first who ever did
There's things I wanna talk about, but better not to give
But if you hold me without hurting me
You'll be the first who ever did

[Post-Chorus]
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
Hold me, love me, touch me, honey
Be the first who ever did
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
Hold me, love me, touch me, honey
Be the first who ever did

[Chorus]
There's things I wanna say to you, but I'll just let you live
Like if you hold me without hurting me
You'll be the first who ever did
There's things I wanna talk about, but better not to give
Like if you hold me without hurting me
You'll be the first who ever did

[Verse 1]
My pussy tastes like Pepsi cola
My eyes are wide like cherry pies
I got sweet taste for men who are older
It's always been so, it's no surprise

[Pre-Chorus]
Ah, he's in the sky with diamonds and he's making me crazy

All he wants to do is party with his pretty baby

[Chorus]
Come on, baby, let's ride
We can escape to the great sunshine
I know your wife and she wouldn't mind
We made it out to the other side
We made it out to the other side
We made it out to the other side

[Post-Chorus]
Come on, come on
Come on, come on, come on, baby
Oh, oh yeah

[Verse 2]
I fall asleep in an American flag
I wear my diamonds on Skid Row
I pledge allegiance to my dad
For teaching me everything he knows

[Pre-Chorus]
Ah, he's in the sky with diamonds and he's making me crazy

All he wants to do is party with his pretty baby

[Chorus]
Come on, baby, let's ride
We can escape to the great sunshine
I know your wife and she wouldn't mind
We made it out to the other side
We made it out to the other side
We made it out to the other side

[Bridge]
Drugs, suck it up, like vanilla icies
Don't treat me rough, treat me really niceys
Decorate my neck, diamantes ices
Why, come on, come on


[Chorus  Variation]
Come on, baby, let's ride
We can escape to the great sunshine
I know your wife and she wouldn't mind
We made it out to the other side
Come on, baby, let's ride
We can escape to the great sunshine
We made it out to the other side
We made it out to the other side

[Outro]
Come on, come on, come on, baby
Come on, come on, come on, baby
Oh, oh

Ooh, ahh

Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh

Ooh, oh yeah

[Verse 1]
I miss Long Beach and I miss you, babe
I miss dancing with you the most of all
I miss the bar where the Beach Boys would go
Dennis' last stop before Kokomo

[Pre-Chorus]
Those nights were on fire
We couldn't get higher
We didn't know that we had it all
But nobody warns you before the fall

[Chorus]
And I'm wasted
Don't leave I just need a wake-up call
I'm facing the greatest
The greatest loss of them all
The culture is lit and I had a ball
I guess I'm signing off after all

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 2]
I miss New York and I miss the music
Me and my friends we miss rock 'n' roll
I want shit to feel just like it used to
When baby, I was doing nothin' the most of all

[Pre-Chorus]
The culture is lit, and if this is it I had a ball
I guess that I'm burned out after all

[Chorus]
I'm wasted
Don't leave, I just need a wake-up call
I'm facing the greatest
The greatest loss of them all
The culture is lit and I had a ball
I guess that I'm burned out after all

[Outro]
If this is it, I'm signing off
Miss doing nothin' the most of all
Hawaii just missed that fireball
L.A. is in flames it's getting hot
Kanye West is blond and gone
"Life on Mars" ain't just a song
I hope the live stream's almost on

[Verse 1]
Finally
I'm crossing the threshold
From the ordinary world
To the reveal of my heart
Undoubtedly
That will for certain
Take the dead out of the sea
And the darkness from the arts

[Pre-Chorus]
This is my commitment
My modern manifesto
I'm doin' it for all of us
Who never got the chance
For and for 
And all my birds of paradise 
Who never got to fly at night 
'Cause they were caught up in the dance

[Chorus]
Sometimes it feels like I've got a war in my mind
I want to get off, but I keep ridin' the ride
I never really noticed that I had to decide
To play someone's game or live my own life
And now I do
I wanna move
Out of the black 
Into the blue 

[Verse 2]
Finally
Gone is the burden
Of the Crowley way of being
That comes from energies combined
Like my part was I
Was not discernin'
And you, as we found out
Were not in your right mind

[Pre-Chorus]
There's no more chasing rainbows
And hoping for an end to them
Their arches are illusions
Solid at first glance
But then you try to touch them 
There's nothing to hold on to 
The colors used to lure you in 
And put you in a trance 

[Chorus]
Sometimes it feels like I've got a war in my mind
I want to get off, but I keep ridin' the ride
I never really noticed that I had to decide
To play someone's game or live my own life
And now I do
I wanna move
Out of the black 
Into the blue 
Out of the black 
Into the blue 
Out of the black 
Into the blue 

[Verse 1]
Do you want me or do you not?
I heard one thing, now I'm hearing another
Dropped a pin to my parking spot
The bar was hot, it's 2 AM, it feels like summer

[Refrain 1]
Happiness is a butterfly
Try to catch it, like, every night
It escapes from my hands into moonlight
Every day is a lullaby
Hum it on the phone, like, every night
Sing it for my babies on the tour life, ah

[Pre-Chorus]
If he's a serial killer, then what's the worst
That can happen to a girl who's already hurt?
I'm already hurt
If he's as bad as they say, then I guess I'm cursed
Looking into his eyes, I think he's already hurt
He's already hurt

[Chorus]
I said, "Don't be a jerk, don't call me a taxi"
Sitting in your sweatshirt, crying in the backseat, ooh
I just wanna dance with you
Hollywood and Vine, Black Rabbit in the alley
I just wanna hold you tight down the avenue
I just wanna dance with you
I just wanna dance with you

[Post-Chorus]
Baby, I just wanna dance 
With you 
Baby, I just wanna dance 
With you

[Verse 2]
Left the canyon, drove to the club
I was one thing, now I'm being another
Laurel down to Sunset in the truck
I'll pick you up if you're in town on the corner, ah

[Refrain 2]
Happiness is a butterfly
We should catch it while dancing
I lose myself in the music, baby
Every day is a lullaby
Try to catch it like lightning
I sing it into my music, I'm crazy

[Pre-Chorus]
If he's a serial killer, then what's the worst
That can happen to a girl who's already hurt?
I'm already hurt
If he's as bad as they say, then I guess I'm cursed
Looking into his eyes, I think he's already hurt
He's already hurt

[Chorus]
I said, "Don't be a jerk, don't call me a taxi"
Sitting in your sweatshirt, crying in the backseat, ooh
I just wanna dance with you
Hollywood and Vine, Black Rabbit in the alley
I just wanna hold you tight down the avenue
I just wanna dance with you
I just wanna dance with you

[Post-Chorus]
Baby, I just wanna dance 
With you 
Baby, I just wanna dance 
With you

[Intro]
I don't belong in the world, that's what it is
Something separates me from other people
Everywhere I turn, there's something blocking my escape

[Verse 1]
It took thirteen beaches to find one empty
But finally, it's mine
With drippin' peaches, I'm camera ready
Almost all the time

[Pre-Chorus]
But I still get lonely
And baby, only then do I let myself recline
Can I let go, and let your memory dance
In the ballroom of my mind?
Across the county line

[Chorus]
It hurts to love you, but I still love you
It's just the way I feel
And I'd be lyin' if I kept hidin'
The fact that I can't deal
And that I've been dyin' 
For somethin' real
That I've been dyin' for somethin' real

[Verse 2]
It took thirteen beaches to find one empty
But finally, I'm fine
Past Ventura and lenses plenty
In the white sunshine

[Pre-Chorus]
But you still can find me, if you ask nicely
Underneath the pines
With the daisies, feelin' hazy
In the ballroom of my mind
Across the county line

[Chorus]
It hurts to love you, but I still love you
It's just the way I feel
And I'd be lyin' if I kept hidin'
The fact that I can't deal
And that I've been dyin' 
For somethin' real
That I've been dyin' for somethin' real

[Outro]
It hurts to love you, but I still love you
It's just the way I feel
And I'd be lying' if I kept hidin'
The fact that I can't deal
The fact that I can't deal

[Intro]
L.A., L.A.
L.A., L.A.

[Verse 1]
In the land of gods and monsters
I was an angel living in the garden of evil
Screwed up, scared, doing anything that I needed
Shining like a fiery beacon

[Pre-Chorus]
You got that medicine I need
Fame, liquor, love, give it to me slowly
Put your hands on my waist, do it softly
Me and God, we don't get along, so now I sing

[Chorus]
No one's gonna take my soul away
I'm living like Jim Morrison
Headed towards a fucked up holiday
Motel sprees, sprees and I'm singing
"Fuck yeah, give it to me, this is Heaven, what I truly want"
It's innocence lost, innocence lost

[Verse 2]
In the land of gods and monsters
I was an angel looking to get fucked hard
Like a groupie incognito, posing as a real singer
Life imitates art

[Pre-Chorus]
You got that medicine I need
Dope, shoot it up, straight to the heart, please
I don't really wanna know what's good for me
God's dead, I said, "Baby, that's alright with me"

[Chorus]
No one's gonna take my soul away
I'm living like Jim Morrison
Headed towards a fucked up holiday
Motel sprees, sprees and I'm singing
"Fuck yeah, give it to me, this is Heaven, what I truly want"
It's innocence lost, innocence lost

[Bridge]
When you talk, it's like a movie and you're makin' me crazy
'Cause life imitates art
If I get a little prettier, can I be your baby?
You tell me life isn't that hard

[Chorus]
No one's gonna take my soul away
I'm living like Jim Morrison
Headed towards a fucked up holiday
Motel sprees, sprees and I'm singing
"Fuck yeah, give it to me, this is Heaven, what I truly want"
It's innocence lost, innocence lost

[Verse 1]
Topanga is hot tonight, the city by the bay
Has movie stars and liquor stores and soft decay
The rumblin' from distant shores sends me to sleep
But the facts of life can sometimes make it hard to dream

[Pre-Chorus]
Life rocked me like Mtley
Grabbed me by the ribbons in my hair
Life rocked me ultra softly
Like the heavy metal that you wear

[Chorus]
I'm flyin' to the moon again, dreamin' about heroin
How it gave you everything and took your life away
I put you on an aeroplane, destined for a foreign land
I hoped that you'd come back again
And tell me everything's okay, ay, babe, yeah

[Verse 2]
Topanga's hot today, Manson's in the air
And all my friends have gone, 'cause they still feel him here
I want to leave, I'll probably stay another year
It's hard to leave when absolutely nothin's clear

[Pre-Chorus]
Life rocked me like Mtley
Bad beginnin' to my new year
Life rocked me ultra softly
Like the heavy metal that you hear

[Chorus]
I'm flyin' to the moon again, dreamin' about heroin
And how it gave you everything and took your life away
I put you on the aeroplane, destined for a foreign land
I thought that you'd come back again
To tell me everything's okay, ay, babe, yeah

[Bridge]
 Winter in the city
Somethin' 'bout this weather made these kids go crazy
 Even for February
Somethin' 'bout this sun has made these kids get scary
Oh, writin' in blood on my walls and shit
Like, ah, oh my God
Jumpin' off from the walls into the docks and shit
Oh, ho ho ho, I'd be lyin' if I said I wasn't sick of it
Baby , come on , come on 

[Chorus]
I'm flyin' to the moon again, dreamin' about marzipan
Taking all my medicine to take my thoughts away
I'm getting on that aeroplane, leavin' my old man again
I hope that I come back one day
To tell you that I really changed, baby

[Outro]
 Somethin' 'bout the city
Don't know what it is, it makes my head get crazy
Oh, makes me feel like I can change
Oh, ho ho ho, all of my evil ways and shit
Oh, I'd be lying if I said I wasn't sick of it

[Verse 1]
Not even they can stop me now
Boy, I be flying overhead
Their heavy words can't bring me down
Boy, I've been raised from the dead

[Pre-Chorus 1]
No one even knows how hard life was
I don't even think about it now because
I've finally found you


[Chorus]
Now my life is sweet like cinnamon
Like a fucking dream I'm living in
Baby, love me 'cause I'm playing on the radio

Lick me up and take me like a vitamin
'Cause my body's sweet like sugar venom, oh yeah
Baby, love me 'cause I'm playing on the radio


[Verse 2]
American dreams came true somehow
I swore I'd chase 'em 'til I was dead
I heard the streets were paved with gold
That's what my father said

[Pre-Chorus 2]
No one even knows what life was like
Now I'm in L.A., and it's paradise
I've finally found you


[Chorus]
Now my life is sweet like cinnamon
Like a fucking dream I'm living in
Baby, love me 'cause I'm playing on the radio

Lick me up and take me like a vitamin
'Cause my body's sweet like sugar venom, oh yeah
Baby, love me 'cause I'm playing on the radio


[Bridge]

Sweet like cinnamon
Like a fucking dream I'm living in
Baby, love me 'cause I'm playing on the radio


Sweet like cinnamon
Like a fucking dream I'm living in
I've finally found you


[Chorus]
Now my life is sweet like cinnamon
Like a fucking dream I'm living in
Baby, love me 'cause I'm playing on the radio

Lick me up and take me like a vitamin
'Cause my body's sweet like sugar venom, oh yeah
Baby, love me 'cause I'm playing on the radio


Now my life is sweet like cinnamon
Like a fucking dream I'm living in
Baby, love me 'cause I'm playing on the radio

Lick me up and take me like a vitamin
'Cause my body's sweet like sugar venom, oh yeah
Baby, love me 'cause I'm playing on the radio
[Verse 1]
My baby lives in shades of blue
Blue eyes and jazz and attitude
He lives in California too
He drives a Chevy Malibu
And when he calls, he calls for me and not for you
He lives for love, he loves his drugs, he loves his baby too

[Pre-Chorus]
But I can't fix him, can't make him better
And I can't do nothing about his strange weather

[Chorus]
But you are unfixable
I can't break through your world
'Cause you live in shades of cool
Your heart is unbreakable

[Verse 2]
My baby lives in shades of cool
Cool heart and hands and aptitude
He lives for love, for women too
I'm one of many, Bonnies blue
And when he calls, he calls for me and not for you
He prays for love, he prays for peace and maybe someone new

[Pre-Chorus]
But I can't help him, can't make him better
And I can't do nothing about his strange weather

[Chorus]
'Cause you are unfixable
I can't break through your world
'Cause you live in shades of cool
Your heart is unbreakable

[Bridge]
Your hot, hot weather in the summer
Hot, hot, neglectful lover
Hot, hot weather in the summer
High, neglectful lover
You're crumbling, sadly
You're crumbling, sadly

[Chorus]
You are unfixable
I can't break through your world
'Cause you live in shades of cool
Your heart is unbreakable

[Outro]
Pa pa da pa
Pa pa da ah, oh
Oh, oh
Oh

[Verse 1]
Packin' all my things for the summer
Lyin' on my bed, it's a bummer
'Cause I didn't call when I got your number
But I liked you a lot
Slippin' on my dress in soft filters
Everybody said you're a killer
But I couldn't stop the way I was feelin'
The day your record dropped

[Chorus]
The day I saw your white Mustang
Your white Mustang
The day I saw your white Mustang
Your white Mustang

[Verse 2]
Caught up in my dreams and forgettin'
I've been actin' like armageddon 'cause you
Held me in your arms just a little too tight
That's what I thought
Summer's meant for lovin' and leavin'
I was such a fool for believin' that you
Could change all the ways you've been livin'
But you just couldn't stop

[Chorus]
The day I saw your white Mustang
Your white Mustang
The day I saw your white Mustang
Your white Mustang

[Bridge]
You're revvin' and revvin' and revvin' it up
And the sound, it was frightenin'
And you were gettin' a part of that
You're gonna hit me like lightnin'

[Chorus]
White Mustang
Your white Mustang
The day I saw your white Mustang
Said you're a wild mustang

[Outro]
You're gonna hit me like lightnin'
You're gonna hit me like lightnin'

[Verse 1]
Life is awesome, I confess
What I do, I do best
You got nothing, I got tested
And I passed, yes

[Pre-Chorus]
Lay me down tonight in my linen and curls
Lay me down tonight, Riviera girls

[Chorus]
I fucked my way up to the top
This is my show
I fucked my way up to the top
Go, baby, go
Go, go, go, go, go
This is my show
Go, go, go, go, go
This is my show

[Verse 2]
I'm a dragon, you're a whore
Don't even know what you're good for
Mimicking me's a fucking bore
To me, but babe

[Pre-Chorus]
Lay me down tonight in my diamonds and pearls
Tell me something nice 'bout your favorite girl

[Chorus]
I fucked my way up to the top
This is my show
I fucked my way up to the top
Go, baby, go
Go, go, go, go, go
This is my show
Go, go, go, go, go
This is my show

[Bridge]
Need you, baby, like I breathe you, baby
Need you, baby, more, more, more, more
Need you, baby, like I breathe you, baby
Fuckin' need you, baby, more, more, more, more

[Pre-Chorus]
Lay me down tonight in my linen and curls
Lay me down tonight, I'm your favorite girl

[Chorus]
I fucked my way up to the top
This is my show
I fucked my way up to the top
Go, baby, go
Go, go, go, go, go
This is my show
Go, go, go, go, go
This is my show

[Outro]
Need you, baby, like I breathe you, baby
I need you, baby, more, more, more, more
Need you, baby, like I breathe you, baby
Ah, ah
Ah

[Verse 1]
I'm smokin' while I'm runnin' on my treadmill
But I'm comin' up roses
Could it be that I fell for another loser?
I'm cryin' while I'm cummin'
Makin' love while I'm makin' good money
Sobbin' in my cup of coffee
'Cause I fell for another loser

[Pre-Chorus]
Get that cigarette smoke out of my face
You've been wastin' my time
While you're takin' what's mine with the things that you're doin'
Talk that talk, well, now they all know your name
And there's no comin' back from the place that you came
Baby, don't do it

[Chorus]
'Cause you got me in my feelings

Talkin' in my sleep again

Talkin' while I'm screamin'

Who's doper than this bitch? Who's freer than me?
You wanna make the switch? Be my guest, baby
I'm feelin' all my fuckin' feelings

[Verse 2]
I'm smokin' while I'm runnin'
This town and you better believe it, honey
I'm laughin' as I'm taking no prisoners
And taking down names
I'm cryin' while I'm gunnin'
In the smoke they can hear me comin'
If you were me, and I was you
I'd get out of my way

[Pre-Chorus]
Get that cigarette smoke out of my face
You've been wastin' my time while you're takin' what's mine
Well, you know what you're doin'
Talk that talk, well, now they all know your name
And there's no comin' back from the place that you came
Baby, don't do it

[Chorus]
'Cause you got me in my feelings

Talkin' in my sleep again

Talkin' while I'm screamin'

Who's doper than this bitch? Who's freer than me?
You wanna make the switch? Be my guest, baby
I'm feelin' all my fuckin' feelings

[Bridge]
Got me up in this place right now
Makin' no sense at all
Got me up in this place right now, against the wall
Got me feelin' so blue
Makin' no sense at all
Gotta leave right now

[Chorus]
'Cause you got me in my feelings

Talkin' in my sleep again

Talkin' while I'm screamin'

Who's doper than this bitch? Who's freer than me?
You wanna make the switch? Be my guest, baby
I'm feelin' all my fuckin' feelings

[Verse 1]
White lines, pretty baby, tattoos
Don't know what they mean
They're special, just for you
White palms, baking powder on the stove
Cooking up a dream, turning diamonds into snow

[Verse 2]
I feel you, pretty baby, feel me
Turn it up hot, loving you is free
I like it down, like it down way low
But you already know that
You already know


[Pre-Chorus]
Come on down to Florida
I got something for ya
We could see the kilos or the Keys, baby, oh yeah
Guns in the summertime
Chic-a-Cherry Cola lime
Prison isn't nothing to me if you'll be by my side

[Chorus]
Yayo, yayo, yayo
And all the dope fiends
Yayo, yayo, yayo


[Verse 3]
Sun in my mouth and gold hoops
You like your little baby like you like your drinks, cool
White lines, pretty daddy, go skiing
You snort it like a champ, like the winter we're not in


[Pre-Chorus]
Come on down to Florida
I got something for ya
We could see the kilos or the Keys, baby, oh yeah
Guns in the summertime
Chic-a-Cherry Cola lime
Prison isn't nothing to me if you'll be by my side

[Chorus]
Yayo, yayo, yayo
And all the dope fiends
Yayo, yayo, yayo

[Bridge]
We could get high in Miami
Ooh, ooh
Dance the night away
People never die in Miami
Ooh, ooh
That's what they all say 

[Interlude]


[Pre-Chorus]
Come on down to Florida
I got something for ya
We could see the kilos or the Keys, baby, oh yeah
Guns in the summertime
Chic-a-Cherry Cola lime
Prison don't mean nothing to me if you'll be by my side

[Chorus  Variation]
Yayo, yayo, yayo
All the Floridians like
Yayo, yayo, yayo
All the Colombians like
Yayo, yayo, yayo
And all my girlfriends
Yayo, yayo, yayo

[Outro]
That's how we do it, like
Mm-mm, pretty baby
White lines, pretty baby
Gold teeth, pretty baby
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Dance the night away

[Verse 1]
All the lights in Miami begin to gleam
Ruby, blue and green, neon too
Everything looks better from above, my king
Like aquamarine, ocean's blue

[Chorus]
Ah-ah-ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah

Soft ice cream

[Verse 2]
All the lights are sparkling for you, it seems
On the downtown scenes, shady blue
Beatboxing and rapping in the summer rain
Like a boss, you sang jazz and blues

[Chorus]
Ah-ah-ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
Calciatore
La-da-da-da-da

[Verse 3]
The summer's wild
And I've been waiting for you all this time
I adore you, can't you see you're meant for me?
The summer's hot
But I've been cold without you
I was so wrong not to doubt, your Medelln tangerine dream

[Bridge]
Catch me if you can
Working on my tan
Salvatore
Dying by the hand
Of a foreign man
Happily
Calling out my name
In the summer rain
Ciao, amore
Salvatore can wait
Now it's time to eat
Soft ice cream

[Chorus]
Ah-ah-ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah

[Intro]
Huh, yeah, naw I just, had a lil' bit too much of Hennessy
Just gotta tell you how I feel, look

[Verse 1]
You so fuckin' precious when you smile
Hit it from the back and drive you wild
Girl, I lose myself up in those eye-eye-eye-eye-eyes
I just had to let you know you're mine

[Chorus]
Hands on your body, I don't wanna waste no time
Feels like forever even if forever's tonight
Just lay with me, waste this night away with me
You're mine, I can't look away, I just gotta say

[Verse 2]
I'm so fucking happy you're alive
Swear to God I'm down if you're down all you gotta say is right
Girl anything I can do just to make you feel alright
Oh, oh, oh, oh, I just had to let you know you're fine
Running circles 'round my mind
Even when it's rainy all you ever do is shine
You on fire, you a star just like Mariah
Man this feel incredible, I'll turn you into a bride, you're mine

[Chorus]
Hands on your body, I don't wanna waste no time
Feels like forever even if forever's tonight
Just lay with me, waste this night away with me
You're mine, I can't look away, I just gotta say

[Chorus]
Hey
Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful, beautiful angel
Love your imperfections, every angle
Tomorrow comes and goes before you know
So I just had to let you know

[Post-Chorus]
The way that Gucci look on you, amazing
But nothing can compare to when you're naked
Now a Backwood and some Henny got you faded
Saying you the one for me, I need to face it

[Verse]
Started when we were younger
Swear to God that I loved her
Sorry that your mum found out
Guess that we just really had the thunder
Ain't nobody else that I'd be under
Beautiful, beautiful life right now
Beautiful, beautiful night right now
No, no, no

[Chorus]
Hey
Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful, beautiful angel
Love your imperfections, every angle
Tomorrow comes and goes before you know
So I just had to let you know

[Post-Chorus]
The way that dress fall off you is amazing
Love a miracle, a beautiful creation
Baby, come a little closer, let me taste it
You came a little closer, now you're shaking

[Bridge]
Never ever gon' mislead you
Don't believe the lies they feed you
Stop and stare like a sculpture
Painted in your colors
Beautiful, beautiful life right now
Beautiful, beautiful night right now
Beautiful, beautiful by my side right now, yeah

[Chorus]
Hey 
Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful, beautiful angel
Love your imperfections every angle 
Tomorrow comes and goes before you know

So I just had to let you know

[Post-Chorus]
The way that Gucci look on you amazing, yeah
But nothing can compare to when you're naked 

Tomorrow comes and goes before you know
So I just had to let you know

[Outro]
I just had to let you know
Swear to God you're beautiful, yeah

[Chorus: Bazzi]
Hey
Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful, beautiful angel
Love your imperfections, every angle
Tomorrow comes and goes before you know
So I just had to let you know

[Post-Chorus: Bazzi]
The way that Gucci look on you, amazing
But nothing can compare to when you're naked
Now a Backwood and some Henny got you faded
Saying you're the one for me, I need to face it

[Verse 1: Bazzi]
Started when we were younger
Swear to God that I loved her
Sorry that your mom found out
Guess that we just really had the thunder
Ain't nobody else that I'd be under
Beautiful, beautiful life right now
Beautiful, beautiful night right now
No, no, no

[Chorus: Bazzi]
Hey
Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful, beautiful angel
Love your imperfections, every angle

So I just had to let you know

[Verse 2: Camila Cabello]
Oh my God, where did the time go?
I wish the hours would go slow
How is it 6 AM?
Your touch is heaven-sent
Beautiful, beautiful sight right now
Beautiful, beautiful life right now
Got the angels singing ooh-ah right now like, ooh-ah
And this is why weve got to touch 
Sometimes words are not enough 
Painted in your golden kiss, honey dripping from your lips
I thank God and my lucky stars
Darling, don't you know what you are?
Yeah, baby, you are

[Chorus: Bazzi,  & Both]
Hey 
Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful, beautiful angel 
Love your imperfections, every angle 
Tomorrow comes and goes before you know 
So I just had to let you know

[Outro: Bazzi,  & Both]
The way that Gucci look on you amazing 
But nothing can compare to when you're naked

Tomorrow comes and goes before you know 
So I just had to let you know 
I just had to let you know
Swear to God you're beautiful, yeah

[Verse 1]
I'm still on your Netflix
Girl, I know you love me
Even though your parents
They don't fucking trust me
They probably all right though
I know I'm an asshole
No reply to all your texts, girl, I do you mad cold

[Pre-Chorus]
Like you're just
Dying to drive, but you can't find the keys
Not looking for God, but you're down on your knees
I'm all that you want, but not what you need, girl, why?

[Chorus]
Tell me why do you still love me
Why do you love me?
You know you shouldn't love me
Yeah, you still love me

[Verse 2]
All your friends tell you they hate me
God, I'm fuckin' shady
Couple weeks ago they were inside my sheets naked
Club, so you can Snapchat
Titties out to snap that
I know that you do that shit just hoping for a snap back

[Pre-Chorus]
Like you're just
Dying to drive, but you can't find the keys
Not looking for God, but you're down on your knees
I'm all that you want, but not what you need, girl, why?


[Chorus]
Tell me why do you still love me
Why do you love me?
You know you shouldn't love me
Yeah, you still love me, oh

[Bridge]
Why do you need me when you know you don't need me?
It's tearing you apart
I leave you broken and shaken
And you still call me baby

[Chorus]
Tell me why do you still love me 
Why do you love me? 
You know you shouldn't love me 
Yeah, you still love me 

[Intro]
This my baby
This my
Look

[Verse 1]
Touchin' you slowly, love how you hold me
I was a player, that was the old me
I sent a prayer for something holy
Got naked and show me
Girl, summer's been lonely, yeah
At first, I was hesitant
 Like a skeleton
You 20, but intelligent
Now all them other bitches so irrelevant, ah-ah, yeah
Tan lines and some memories 
Guess summer got the best of me 
Chef B with the recipe, yeah
With you, it's a better me

[Chorus]
I guess what I'm sayin', I guess what I'm sayin'
I guess what I'm sayin' is, I
I fuckin' love you
I guess what I'm sayin', I guess what I'm sayin'
I guess what I'm sayin' is, I
I fuckin' love you 
Love you through the better days
Love you through the rainy ones
Champion, you're number one, yeah, that's true
I guess what I'm sayin', I guess what I'm sayin'
I guess what I'm sayin' is, I
I fuckin' love you 

[Verse 2]
Yes, I do, chillin' top floor with a penthouse view
But that don't mean a thing unless I'm next to you
'Cause money just money 'less I spend it on you
Next to me, when I'm with you, you bring out the best of me
God made you a twin, but you the one I see
But shoutout to Elisha, that's my baby 
But if I wrote you a love song, would you sing it?
If I needed bail out of jail, would you bring it?
If I win, then we're up, if we fail, then we wing it

[Chorus]
I guess what I'm sayin', I guess what I'm sayin'
I guess what I'm sayin' is, I
I fuckin' love you 
I guess what I'm sayin', I guess what I'm sayin'
I guess what I'm sayin' is, I
I fuckin' love you 
Love you through the better days 
Love you through the rainy ones
Champion, you're number one, yeah, that's true
But I guess what I'm sayin', I guess what I'm sayin'
I guess what I'm sayin' is, I
I fuckin' love you 

[Outro]
That's my baby, yeah
My baby, uh, uh
My baby, yeah
That's my baby, yeah
My baby, uh, uh
My baby

[Verse 1]
Laying next to you, I got a flight in the morning
Got me questioning what I think is important
I can't even lie, think of you when I'm with her
Look me in my eye, tell me that you feel different
Drove two hours just to stay the night with you
Haven't seen you in a year, but I still get you
Hurts to see you laugh 'cause I know I'll fucking miss that
How could I forget that?

[Chorus]
You made me feel alive
Forget them other bitches, I will put 'em to the side
Girls in L.A. couldn't be more dry
You're so money, baby, you ain't even have to try
Now I'm runnin' with you 'round East Lansing
Tito's in your dorm, we're dancing
It's a quarter after three
Sayin' everything we mean

[Verse 2]
Girl, it's hard to see me go so fast, yeah, I get that
Times that we have, so wild, can't forget that
Now I'm on a flight in my feels, thinkin' 'bout you
Hope you know you fire, fuck anyone who doubts you
Life out in Cali has been great, I'm committed
You the only thing that makes me wish things were different
I might fly you out, get your ass on a one-way
If I had it my way...

[Chorus]
Girl, you'd be by my side
Forget them other bitches, I will put 'em to the side
Girls in L.A. couldn't be more dry
You're so money, baby, you ain't even have to try
Now I'm runnin' with you 'round East Lansing
Tito's in your dorm, we're dancing
It's a quarter after three
Sayin' everything we mean

[Bridge]
Maybe I'm stuck in the past, girl
Not willing to let it all go
You can't ignore the fact, baby

[Chorus]
You made me feel alive
Fuck them other bitches, I will put 'em to the side
Shit's so real, baby, look me in my eyes
You're so money, baby, you ain't even have to try
Now I'm runnin' with you 'round East Lansing
Tito's in your dorm, we're dancing
It's a quarter after three
Sayin' everything we mean

[Outro]
For a moment, I was feeling like I had you
Didn't wanna leave, I had to
It's a quarter after three
Saying everything we mean

[Verse 1]
I think I'm losing my mind
Trying to stay inside the lines
It's like I'm running in place
How you keep staying the same?
Baby, I, I guess I'm something different
And I'm okay with that
I can't fake no more smiles
That shit gon' drive me mad
I'm focused on the future
Don't care 'bout nothin' else

[Chorus]
I'm better by myself
I'm better by myself
I don't need no one else
I'm better by myself
Myself

[Verse 2]
Don't wanna answer questions
Just want your company
It's all good on the surface
Show me what's underneath
I'm not concerned with drama
I left that shit in school
I'm more concerned with commas
Than keeping up with you
Keep that away from me
I put the Heisman up to bad energy
No empathy, especially when the kid off Hennessy
Fake friends to me make my mood go south like Tennessee
Make the fool come out like, "Who is he?"
I mean, I'm trying to tell y'all

[Chorus]
I'm better by myself
I'm better by myself
I don't need no one else
I'm better by myself
Myself

[Outro]
I don't know who to trust
These days everyone's shady
Fool me once, I'm on my own
There is no second time, baby
That's the shit I don't like
Please no yes, no maybes
What else?

[Intro]
One, two, three, four

[Verse 1]
Hands on your body, I'm grabbin' your ass
Enjoyin' the moment 'cause life move too fast
I'm lookin' forward, ignorin' the past
These are the times that we'll laugh lookin' back
I'm gettin' lucky like coins in the well
Goodbye to my haters, I'm wishin' you well
This is my year, man, if you couldn't tell

[Pre-Chorus]
This is our life and we livin' it well
Late nights in the city, causin' hell
Burn this bitch into the ground, oh well
If all we got tonight, let's do this right
Let's do this right

[Chorus]
Let's go to 
This shit feel like Friday nights
This shit make me feel alive
I feel like we in paradise, paradise 
Don't know if it's the drink I poured
But I swear I've never loved you more
When you right here, I come alive
One more hit and we can fly
This shit feel like 

[Verse 2]
I'm feelin' it, my head's where the ceilin' is 
This energy turns nights into memories 
Count up the bands, you've been workin' all summer
Ex didn't know what he had, what a bummer
Insecure people turn to insecure lovers
Well, my drink is almost out and I'm about to pour another

[Bridge]
Just let it out
The night has just begun, we on a level now
If I get too fucked up, promise you'll hold me down
Yeah, this that shit you can't deny
This that shit you feel inside

[Pre-Chorus]
This our life, our time, we livin' well
Late nights in the city, causin' hell
Burn this bitch into the ground, oh well
If all we got tonight, let's do this right
Let's do this right

[Chorus]
Let's go to 
This shit feel like Friday nights 
This shit make me feel alive 
I feel like we in paradise, paradise 
Don't know if it's the drink I poured 
But I swear I've never loved you more 
When you right here, I come alive
One more hit and we can fly
This shit feel like 

[Intro]


[Verse 1]
Gonna turn my read receipts on
Just to let you know I won't respond
Girl, it hurts me to do this
But I'm not looking for excuses
And I deleted all your info
'Cause I heard about the info
Always knew that you'd be ruthless
But I never thought that you could do this, oh

[Pre-Chorus]
And the fucked-up part is I gave y'all the intro
That was my dude, why'd you gotta pick him though?
I was selfish in the way that I acted
Now you doing things just to get a reaction

[Chorus]
Yeah, I wonder if he's there with you now, fucking you like I used to
I know you think about all the things that we did when he's with you
And do you feel no shame?
Does he make you feel the same?
Could we have got what we wanted
Oh, if we had just been honest?

[Post-Chorus]
Why can't we just be honest?
If we had just been honest

[Verse 2]
Remember 
Late night, smokin' weed under star projectors
Looked in my eyes, said, "Will this last forever?"
I think we both know what was up, where this was goin'
But the sex was too good, we got caught up in the moment
Now you took my best friend and turn him into my opponent
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
Did you forget that I gave y'all the intro?
That was my dude; why'd you gotta pick him though?
I was selfish in the way that I acted
I keep doing things just to get a reaction

[Chorus]
Yeah, I wonder if he's there with you now, fucking you like I used to
I know you think about all the things that we did when he's with you
And do you feel no shame?
Does he make you feel the same?
Could we have got what we wanted
Oh, if we had just been honest?

[Post-Chorus]
Why can't we just be honest?
If we had just been honest
If we had just been honest

[Outro]
Maybe it's the pills
Maybe it's the drugs
Maybe it's the pride

[Chorus: Bazzi]
Slide with me, ride with me, get high with me
You know that I like it when you next to me
Especially, like, sexually
'Cause you know that I'm fuckin' with you heavily
Your energy is heavenly
Don't spend a second trippin' on my enemies
'Cause they envy me and my energy
You know what I'm focused on

[Verse 1: Bazzi]
I'm feelin' like a star
If you think it, then you are
Put the focus back on me, cut all negativity
Now I fuckin' live my dreams
Whatever I imagine
I know that shit can happen
Yeah, my energy on dragon
Burn it down and I start laughin'
Turn the ashes into magic, yeah, yeah
Take another hit, I'm in the sky
Nothin' takes me higher than the mind
Ask about this shit, I'll let you know
Yeah, this the type of shit that free your soul

[Chorus: Bazzi]
Slide with me, ride with me, get high with me
You know that I like it when you next to me
Especially, like, sexually
'Cause you know that I'm fuckin' with you heavily
Your energy is heavenly
Don't spend a second trippin' on my enemies
'Cause they envy me and my energy
You know what I'm focused on

[Verse 2: 21 Savage]
Middle finger to the other side, they hate on me 
They know it wouldn't be wise for them to play with me 
Ridin' through my hood, I got your bae with me 
I took her on a date, I brought my K with me 
Say she like my vibe, where I slide, where I ride 
You got one main bitch, nigga, I got five 
They know not to argue with me, I be way too high 
She top me while I'm drivin', I'ma get a DUI 

[Chorus: Bazzi & 21 Savage]
Slide with me , ride with me , get high with me 
You know that I like it when you next to me 
Especially , like, sexually 
'Cause you know that I'm fuckin' with you heavily 
Your energy  is heavenly 
Don't spend a second trippin' on my enemies 
'Cause they envy me  and my energy 
You know what I'm focused on

[Intro]
A place
Where space
And time
Doesn't exist
Just us

[Chorus]
I had a dream about you last night
Your eyes were shining so bright
Those lips and that bittersweet smile
I need this forever
Beautiful dream, yeah, yeah
Don't know what it means, yeah, yeah
All I know is I don't know
But I need this forever

[Verse 1]
Straight up out a dream
Like a magazine
Girl, it felt good with your body on me
We should never ever leave the sheets, yeah
We could stay forever underneath, yeah

[Bridge]
Ooh, ooh, ooh
It's like dj vu when my hands up on you, like
Ooh, ooh, ooh
I might be naive, but you're more than a dream, yeah
Ooh, ooh, ooh
You made me feel alive, got me two times five, but
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Dreamin' all about you

[Verse 2]
You give me feelings that I can't explain to you
Girl, I was cold for a while, now I'm something new
Tell me what you want, anything at all, I got it though
Swear to God we unstoppable, yeah

[Chorus]
I had a dream about you last night
Your eyes were shining so bright
Those lips and that bittersweet smile

Beautiful dream, yeah, yeah
Don't know what it means, yeah, yeah
All I know is I don't know
But I need this forever

[Outro]
Ooh, ooh, ooh
You give me feelings that I can't explain to you
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Girl, I was cold for a while, now I'm something new
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Tell me what you want, anything at all, I got it though
Swear to God we unstoppable, yeah

[Intro]
Your call has been forwarded to an automated voice message system

[Verse 1]
Maybe I'm cold
Frozen from my past before, damn
Don't get too close
You won't find what you're looking for, I
Oh, no

[Pre-Chorus]
And I hope you don't judge me
All I know is how to be who I am
And if you start to touch me
I hope you know the place where we stand

[Chorus]
Don't tell me that you love me
'Cause I won't love back
Don't tell me that you need me
'Cause I don't need that
Don't tell me that you want me
'Cause I'm on my own
So when we finish touching
Girl, I'm all alone
All alone, all alone

[Verse 2]
Maybe I'm fine
Fine with being by myself, yeah
Maybe I'm not trying
Trying to have nobody else
I'm not

[Pre-Chorus]
And I hope you don't judge me
All I know is how to be who I am
And if you start to touch me
I hope you know the place where we stand

[Chorus]
Don't tell me that you love me

I don't smoke cigarettes
But I know you like to
So I face an entire pack
Just to be there with you
And I never fall for girls
But you got me tripping
Running your hand through my curls
All my worries missin'

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't know if it's the Hennessy
That's got you in your honesty
Oh, I just hope you still mean what you say
When the sun comes up
Oh, I hope it's not the alcohol
That makes me think I want it all
Oh, I just hope I still mean what I say
When the night is up

[Chorus]
Will I want you when I'm sober?
Sober, sober
Will I want you when it's over?
Over, over
Will you want me when you're sober?
Sober, sober
Will you want me when it's over?
Over, over

[Verse 2]
Late night up in the hills
Wish this would last forever
Thinking I want this real -
Feelings can't be misjudged

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't know if it's the Hennessy
That's got you in your honesty
Oh, I just hope you still mean what you say
When the sun comes up
Oh, I hope it's not the alcohol
That makes me think I want it all
Oh, I just hope I still mean what I say
When the night is up

[Chorus]
Will I want you when I'm sober?
Sober, sober
Will I want you when it's over?
Over, over
Will you want me when you're sober?
Sober, sober
Will you want me when it's over?
Over, over

[Bridge]
Morning comes
Will you still want me to stay?
To stay, to stay

[Chorus]
Will I want you when I'm sober?
Sober, sober
Will I want you when it's over?
Over, over
Will you want me when you're sober?
Sober, sober
Will you want me when it's over?
Over, over

[Outro]
Sober

Faded off of that bottle
Livin' like no tomorrow
I like you 'cause I'm lifted
And you like me 'cause I'm gifted
Buttoned down in designer
That Dolce and that Gabbana
Painted just like an angel
I thank the Lord that he made you

[Refrain]
I see it in your eyes
Passion you can't deny
Girl, we can live that life

[Pre-Chorus]
There we are
Smokin' on rolled cigars

You could be
Bigger than your fantasies
Standing right next to me

[Chorus]
I see it all now
You're a star

Passion you can't deny

[Verse 1]
And that's the thing
That thing right there
That's my girl, I can't share
Maybe I'm selfish, I get a little jealous
I lose my mind when you say that
Balmain silk slip off your back
You get so impatient
I know you got your cravings
So tell me you didn't tell all of your girlfriends about this 
Tell me you still think my neighbors don't know, girl, you shout it 
Girl, I know that you've been trying, I swear I'm the proudest 
But the question is, girl, do you think you could live without it? 

[Chorus]
Nothing on you when you naked
Except a Cartier bracelet
Silhouette through the shower
Fuck you 24 hours
Sun peeking through the curtains
Know I'm with you when you're hurting
Baby girl, the world's ours
Fuck you 24 hours
In that shit like oh
Baby girl, the world's ours
Fuck you 24 hours
In that shit like oh
Nothing on you when you naked
Except a Cartier bracelet

[Verse 2]
Nothing on you when you naked
Got a pretty little heart, I don't wanna break it
Girl, I just want to save you
Swear to God, thank the Lord every day that he made you
All the girls tryna flex, they don't phase you
Take you down with my guns, then we blaze, ooh
Get rough, I'ma stay through, stay through
'Cause she rare 
The way she lookin' in the mirror unfair
You know we couldn't even make it upstairs
Had to hit it right there

[Chorus]
Nothing on you when you naked
Except a Cartier bracelet
Silhouette through the shower
Fuck you 24 hours
Sun peeking through the curtains
Know I'm with you when you're hurting
Baby girl, the world's ours
Fuck you 24 hours
In that shit like oh
Baby girl, the world's ours
Fuck you 24 hours
In that shit like oh
Nothing on you when you naked
Except a Cartier bracelet, yeah, yeah

[Chorus]
Too young to see tomorrow
Too young to know it hurts
Found love in empty bottles
I guess we'll never learn
So just lay with me, lay with me, late 'til morning
'Cause I'm high and you're high, together we're soarin'

[Verse 1]
And if I go too hard, pray the Lord my soul to take
I've been up all night, tell tomorrow it can wait
I think we went too far, the ones they couldn't say
Inside you I found faith

[Pre-Chorus]
I apologize if I say
Anything I do mean
'Cause I've been drinking too much
Faded off the gasoline
I'm just trying to live life
Put on for my family
That's on everything
Girl we can do anything
'Cause baby, we are

[Chorus]
Too young to see tomorrow
Too young to know it hurts
Found love in empty bottles
I guess we'll never learn
So just lay with me, lay with me, late 'til morning
'Cause I'm high and you're high, together we're soarin'

[Verse 2]
And if I go too hard, pray the Lord my soul to take
You're here, I'm here, tell me this isn't fate
You should know you could go anywhere you wanna be
Take my hand to find your fantasy

[Pre-Chorus]
I apologize if I say
Anything I do mean
'Cause I've been drinking too much
Faded off the gasoline
I'm just trying to live life
Put on for my family
That's on everything
Girl we can do anything
'Cause baby, we are

[Outro]
'Cause baby, we are
Lay with me 'til the morning
'Cause I'm high and you're high, together we're soarin'

[Verse 1]
Woo!
We on a wave, that luxury flow
And I don't watch what I say, but I say what I know
Don't wait on me, it's too late for me
I walk with that step, Cali air what I breathe
And I've been drinkin' all night, so please excuse me
If I say what I mean, blame it on the Hennessy
Can't stop, won't stop, baby 

[Chorus]
It's too late, for me
I poured it too strong, now, baby, I'm gone
It's too late, for me
I poured it too strong, now, baby, I'm gone
It's too late 

[Verse 2]
Designer on me, I'm covered in that Gucci
Is there tension in the air? Or, baby, is that just me?
Too strong, I'm gone, yeah
Let me switch this flow up real quick
Go-getter, V for Vendetta
Whatever, I just do better
Trendsetter, search for the cheddar
No pressure, float like a feather
Smooth dude, big moves
Big trees, like Snoop
Now I'm back 
Let me bring it back to the track, oh, yeah
Can't stop, won't stop, yeah

[Chorus]
It's too late, for me
I poured it too strong, now, baby, I'm gone
It's too late, for me
I poured it too strong, now, baby, I'm gone
It's too lateI think I'm going through withdrawals
Starin' at her number, I won't call
Yeah, and even though it's all your fault
You the one I run to by default
I'm thinking all about the things you said
That shit is on repeat inside my head
Makin' me feel like a fool
Every sacrifice I made for you
For you, yeah

Starting over is hard to do
'Cause starting over is without you
Alright, I can't keep pretending I'm fine
Fine, yeah

Do you think about me?
Can you live without me?
Baby, when they doubt me
Tell me, do you doubt me?
Yeah, and even though this shit is all your fault
Baby, when they call
Silence to 'em all

'Cause these women want to see me fall, yeah
They don't know me like you do
Yeah, I'm just an object they can use
I'm not out here playing games
I do this for the music, not the fame
So don't you say that I'm the same
'Cause I'm the only thing that hasn't changed
Changed

[Chorus]
Don't trip, I got you
I put ice on your wrist 'cause I want to, yeah

[Verse 2]
I like your skin and your hair and the way that you talk
You a bad little thing, got the step in your walk
OGs in the game, they be in love with my "Star"
I know I haven't been a lover, I'll be here for a while
There's some insecure people tryna mess with the plans
You help me focus on myself, focus on the fans, oh yeah
When it all falls down

[Chorus]
Don't trip, I got you 
I put ice on your wrist 'cause I want to, yeah
You're number one, and I'm cool with two

Ah, I'm just playin'

[Intro]
Just gotta
Clear my head a little bit

[Verse 1]
I don't know what I'm looking for
I don't know what to say anymore
Wouldn't call it sad, I wouldn't call it mad
Something is just not right
I don't wanna feel like this anymore

[Chorus]
That man in the mirror ain't me
In the mirror, ain't me, no, no
That man in the mirror ain't me
In the mirror, ain't me, no, no
I don't wanna feel like this anymore, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse 2]
I don't know what's wrong
But this feeling so strong, let it go
Wishing I could just forget all the gossip in my head
Couldn't tell you what's missing
Man, it's nothing specific
Just a feeling, I'm tripping
Got me so fucked up
Wish I could lift this up
Oh, no, no, no, no

[Chorus]
That man in the mirror ain't me
In the mirror, ain't me, no, no
That man in the mirror ain't me
In the mirror, ain't me, no, no
I don't wanna feel like this anymore, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse 3]
Fighting with my mind
Crossing every line
Getting too close
I just gotta breathe
Smoke a little weed
Learn to let it go

[Bridge]
I know that I'm meant for more than this
I just gotta leave my head and start to live

[Chorus]
That man in the mirror ain't me
In the mirror, ain't me, no, no
That man in the mirror ain't me
In the mirror, ain't me, no, no

[Chorus]
Ridin' my bike like I'm too young to drive

So can I get your AOL? Hit your line like "LOL" 
This feel like our high school days

We ain't gotta fuck or nothing
We could hold hands or somethin' 
Now I'm gonna miss you, oh, well
H.A.G.S., hope your summer goes well

[Pre-Chorus]
But when the night gets late and we're too fucked up
Please don't tell your mom, don't wanna mess this up

She my sidekick, so she hear my side kick
She a vibe, so I gotta top five it

If we was a movie, I wonder how it'd play out 
There's no way that I could lose, lose
When I was runnin' 'round with you, you
Bonfire smell in your hair, hair
Friday night lights, Friday night air

[Pre-Chorus]
It's way too late and we're really fucked up
Please don't tell your mom, don't wanna mess this up
'Cause girl, I think you're fresh, and I like those kicks
You been on my mind, runnin' circles 'round it, so 

[Chorus]

Morning, we saw the night turn into morning
Guess I gotta go right now
Ten more minutes turn into an hour

Wish I could stop the hands of time
And lay right here for life

[Chorus]

And when I'm done with that

Against all odds
No matter what they say

Fuckin' no way
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse]
I'm the same old kid with the high school dreams
Got my eye on the prize, get it by any means
Just go, push the pedal to the floor
Game up in my hands, and bitch, I'll never let it go

There are things that I won't let them take from me
There are dreams that I won't let them take from me

Fantasized 'bout living good
Fuck the tens, I want the hunnids, yeah

Push the pedal to the floor

Three days out the week, I don't even sleep
Thoughts runnin' so deep, take control of me
Crashin' in at once, don't know what it's from
Breakin' me to crumbs, I'm tryin' to run
All these drugs takin' all control of me, ooh
Fuckin' with my energy, ooh
Pullin' and it's holdin' me, ooh
Alternate reality, reality

Look up to the sky, pray for what I want
But I know that I gotta get back to me 
Recenter and actually 
Catch myself midair , then start to floatin' up 
Sometimes I hate my choices, but I can't hold no grudge

Fading slowly, falling faster

[Chorus]
Can we go back to bed? Sleep a little longer
Voices in our heads, drowned out in the thunder
Can we go back to bed? 'Cause I'm not ready to wake up

[Verse 1]
I hate that we been so distant 'cause you know that I love you
Traveled 36 hours just to kiss you and hug you
You're so far, and all I want is to touch you
Smell your cheeks, you know the weird ways I loved you
And now we falling apart and it's killing me slowly
I'm not ready for another girl to touch me or hold me
We was more than lovers, you were my homie
Remember late, late nights, me, you, Annie and Kobe
I'm so obsessed with your spirit, I think that you need to hear it
You always doubtin' yourself, you way more than your appearance
I think album money made you
Beautiful, beautiful angel, perfection in every angle
Now losing you is so painful, damn

[Pre-Chorus]
I know I'm not Mr. Perfect
I know I left you there hurtin'
I was just focused on workin'
And manifestin' my purpose
And now I'm beaten and burnin'
You know that you are my person
You know that you are my person, yeah, yeah

[Chorus]
Can we go back to bed? Sleep a little longer
Voices in our heads, drowned out in the thunder
Can we go back to bed? 'Cause I'm not ready to wake up

[Verse 2]
Yeah, I miss your mom and your dad 
Your sisters, brothers, all of that 
Remember Christmas-time by the pool
I never, ever had a family so that shit was cool
Yeah, I felt like one of they own
I wish we spent more time together, wish you lived in my home
Yeah, I wish I wasn't so busy, I wish that you could be with me
I wish you lived in my city, man
But, I just want you to know
That we should try and make this work 'cause I die watchin' you go
If I see you with another guy, I think I'd explode
Thinkin' 'bout you with somebody made my stomach go, go

[Chorus]
Can we go back to bed? Sleep a little longer
Voices in our heads, drowned out in the thunder
Can we go back to bed? 'Cause I'm not ready to wake up

[Chorus]
You should know
You can go where you wanna go
I can take you there
Wildest dreams, put some faith in me
Take my hand to your fantasy

[Verse 1]
Going through these bottles
Fucking with these models
All the way in Cali
Foot up on the throttle
Focused on the vision
Trying to pay tuition
For the ones I'm missing
Family is a mission
Oh, yeah
Put you on to things you thought were impossible
On and on, me and you, we're unstoppable

[Chorus]
You should know
You can go where you wanna go
I can take you there
Wildest dreams, put some faith in me
Take my hand to your fantasy

[Verse 2]
Oh, in the dark, who you are is a star
I know your worth
What you believe is what you see
And that's what you deserve
Lift your frequencies
Baby you could be out a magazine
Just believe
Open up your mind
Realize you divine
If you know you shine
The world will see

[Chorus]
You should know
You can go where you wanna go
I can take you there
Wildest dreams, put some faith in me
Take my hand to your fantasy

[Outro]
Yeah, yeah
Fantasy

[Intro]
Yeah
Oh, wait

[Verse 1]
Abusing all my authority
Shutting down these sororities
Music is the priority
All the other shit is a minority
Superman, they can't stop me now
Bad vibes, I just block them out
Michigan where I was poppin' out
Now I'm in the Hills and I'm poppin' now
I can't take my eyes
Take them off this life
Oh, yeah
My paradigm is to feel alive

[Pre-Chorus]
If you ever turn your back on me
I'ma turn this thing into a tragedy
And I don't want to end this shit tragically
But I know things ain't what they tend to be
And I want to feel your energy
I don't want to turn you to an enemy, but

[Chorus]
We all want to be somebody
We all want to be anybody
We just want to feel something real
We all want to be somebody
We all want to be anybody
We just want to feel something real

[Verse 2]
I got somethin' to focus on
They see diamonds, they focus gone
20 years and I'm more than strong
I'm in this thing 'til my pulse is done
Feelin' after like novacane
I feel the sun, I don't see the rain
Found myself and the game was changed
No more sleep and I'm wide awake

[Pre-Chorus]
If you ever turn your back on me
I'ma turn this thing into a tragedy
And I don't want to end this shit tragically
But I know things ain't what they tend to be
And I want to feel your energy
I don't want to turn you to an enemy, but

[Chorus]
We all want to be somebody
We all want to be anybody
We just want to feel something real
We all want to be somebody
We all want to be anybody
We just want to feel something real

[Outro]
We all want to be, we all want to be
Somebody
We all want to be, we all want to be
Somebody

[Verse 1]
I can't go on Instagram no more
That shit make me wanna die
I can't see anotherphotograph
Paintin'the perfect lie,yeah
I'm so tired of feelin' paper-thin
LikeI could tear at anytime
Trapped inside of the brain I'm in
Please get me out of my mind

[Pre-Chorus]
Can anybody stop this train?
Take me back into my younger days
I was happy with the simple things
Who am I anymore?

[Chorus]
Who am I anymore?
'Cause really, I don't know
All I wanted was to be something
To be something
But right now , I don't know 
Who I am anymore
Don't have a fuckin' clue
I was hopin' I could be something
I could be something
But right now , I don't know 
Yeah, yeah

[Verse 2]
Take a look in the mirror, I don't know who I've become
Please take me back to the days when I was young
I ain't had no purpose, only thing I had was fun
Now the only thing I feel inside of me is numb
I can't spend another second on my phone
I can't focus on your life, homie, tryna live my own, yeah
Yeah, I got some issues, tryna fight them all alone
But if I'm in here by myself, this house will never be a home

[Pre-Chorus]
 Stop this train
 Take me to my younger days
 Pride's on the floor

[Chorus]
Who am I anymore? 
'Cause really, I don't know 
All I wanted was to be something
To be something
But right now , I don't know 
Who I am anymore?
Don't have a fuckin' clue 
I was hopin' I could be something
I could be something
But right now , I don't know 

[Verse 1]
 The world on fire, let's celebrate
Let's have a toast while we sit and we watch
The whole world go up in flames 
We lost our minds , we going cray 
We let a racist orange man be the president
Ain't that just fuckin' great? 
But we just runnin' around, chasin' the lettuce
I bought a Bentley, still feel pathetic
Ice on my wrist, still feel depression
Music my therapy, it's my obsession
Spittin' these bars, handin' out lessons
Don't go to church, but I'm makin' confessions
Fly like a bird, makin' impressions
I got the answers, just give me your questions

[Chorus]
We've been caught in the fire
We've lost our desire
We're beaten and blue
I pray we save us from ourselves 
'Cause nobody else can do that for you 
I feel like

[Verse 2]
One of one, bitch, I'm original
And I feel like Steph Curry with the finger roll
And I feel like Aaron Rodgers with the give and go
Hope this click inside your head like a metronome
How many times do the kid gotta rhyme
To let all of you know I'm the truth
Not chasing people's opinion of me
'Cause I really got nothing to prove
Not even ill when I'm makin' these songs
My soul is up in the booth
Found my place, I'll never leave
It's me, the crowd, they singin' free like 
My generation is the truth , yeah
I believe in me and you , yeah
Bitch, the future is the youth 
Let me show you what we do
Let me show you what we

[Chorus]
We've been caught in the fire
We've lost our desire
We're beaten and blue
I pray we save us from ourselves 
'Cause nobody else can do that for you 
I feel like

[Outro]
We wanna be free
Just wanna feel something
Just wanna feel something
We wanna be free
Just wanna feel something
Just wanna feel something

[Verse 1]
Count up the bands, count up the digits
All of us died now all of us livin' 
I pimped out my ride call me Xzibit 
I am a man from humble beginnings
Outside Detroit where it's cold and rigid 
You won't be caught if they catch you slippin' 
Family back home my family I'm missin' 
They livin' good like they gettin' commission
They gettin' commission, oh, yeah
Yeah, I'm feelin' good, I'm feelin' right
Stopped smokin' weed but I'm takin' a drag
Think of my pops and where we was at
Whippin' the Grand and it's all that we had
Place-to-pace, facin' eviction
I was like Raven, man, I had the vision
Picture me here, I picture me winnin'
Now I'm in the top floor, I'm smilin', I'm grinnin'

[Chorus]
Can't believe that we made it
Can't believe that we made it
We was broke, we was breakin'
Now I'm here and I'm stayin'
Can't believe that we made it
Can't believe that we made it
We was broke, we was breakin'
Now I'm here and I'm...

[Verse 2]
Countin' the bands, countin' the digits
Wasn't born rich, wasn't born privileged
Lebanese blood, I was born ambitious 
My pops told me, "If you want it, go get it"
You gotta go get it, yeah, yeah
Yeah, I been goin' hard, stayin' hot like the summer
You know I take my chance, I might never get another
Blinded to the hate, like my name is Stevie Wonder
Do it for the fam and the fans and my brothers
'Member Cherry Hill camp, sent there on the bus
Center kept me goin' like a voice from above
Knew that I was destined, man, I knew that I was touched
In my head was conversations that I knew should be discussed
Jumped like seven years, now I've turned into a star
Livin' in my dream, oh, man, I bought my dream car
Realizin', man nothin' doesn't make you who you are
'Cause money buys designer shit to wear over you scars
Damn, money buys designer shit to wear over you scars
Grateful for it all, but my wealth is in my heart
When they tell me that I made it, thought I made it from the start

[Chorus]
Can't believe that we made it 
Can't believe that we made it 
We was broke, we was breakin' 
Now I'm here and I'm stayin'
Can't believe that we made it 
Can't believe that we made it 
We was broke, we was breakin' 
Now I'm here and I'm...

[Intro]
Sometimes I wonder why I'm even here
Or if I have the strength to persevere
Sometimes I feel like Im somebody else
Who's going mental with they mental health
Sometimes I wonder if I'll die alone
Cause lonely people tend to have lonely souls
Sometimes I think about a younger me
If he'd be proud of the man he sees
I guess I'm rich, I made it out my town
I played in front of thousands, you know I shut it down
Look, little Bazzi, I'm living out our dreams
Mama cry every time we on the TV
Got a fancy car, we got a fancy crib
And you couldn't even dream of the girl that you with
Remember all your idols and the people that we love
I met 'em at a party, we was all doin' drugs
We's all doin

[Chorus]
Jesus
I think I need, I think I need some
Jesus
Rich enough and sad as fuck, Im
Lonely
Oh, I am, I am, I am, I'm so
Lonely
Im the man, I guess I am, but I'm still

[Outro]
What's funny is, is my whole life I thought making money and being praised would give me some kind of happiness, and I wanted those things because I was concerned about what everyone else thought of me; I wanted to feel loved, I wanted to feel accepted. And then I realized that I could never feel  anybody's pain or their happiness. I could only feel mine. And the car , and the house, and the fame never made me feel anything except separated  and intoxicated, and honestly kinda grossed. Dont get me wrong  nice things are fun, I like nice things, but you just can't base your human value on them, because at the end of the day, they don't mean anything. If I'm not happy, I'm a sad guy in a nice car. If I don't have any real friends or family, I'm just a lonely guy in a big home. Damn.

[Verse 1]
World on fire, and I'll stand by you
Lookin' in my eyes and you see right through
Heaven is a place on Earth with you
Heaven is a place on Earth with you
Seven in the morning 'cause we just can't sleep 
If I'm outta town, know I'm never outta reach 
I know that you like it, you don't try and fight it
You wanna ignite it, you go where the night ends

[Pre-Chorus]
In the dark, in the rain, I feel you, yeah
In my heart, through the pain, I see you
You're the soul, you're the breath that moves me
Do you really wanna live forever?
I feel like we gonna live forever

[Chorus]
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Do you really wanna live forever?
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
I feel like we gonna live forever

[Verse 2]
First time I laid my eyes on you
Swear to God I knew what I had to do
You were sittin' pretty with that hoodie on
All the makeup gone, everything I wanted was you
Tell me why I can't avoid this feeling 
I don't wanna wake you when you sleeping
Pretty little soul, you love my demons
Say you never leavin', I'm the one you needin', yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
In the dark, in the rain, I feel you 
In my heart, through the pain, I see you
You're the soul, you're the breath that moves me
Do you really wanna live forever?
I feel like we gonna live forever

[Chorus]
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Do you really wanna live forever?
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
I feel like we gonna live forever

[Verse 1]
Selfish people, girl
They always end up alone
How you supposed to eat, get all that you need
Then leave your homies just the bones?
I said selfish people, girl
Can never keep them by your side
The type to hang you out to dry
And I'm never tryna be that guy

[Pre-Chorus]
So all I'm tryna say
If you coming to my place
I put on for my city
All my brothers with me
Really gotta question this

[Chorus]
Do you got friends for my friends, too?
'Cause they all want it bad, girl, just like you, you
Do you got friends for my friends, too?
'Cause they all want it bad, girl, just like you, you

[Verse 2]
I'm an honest guy, I've never been one to lie
Try to ever sugarcoat my lines
I'm giving you the truth, girl, all the time

[Pre-Chorus]
So all I'm tryna say
If you coming to my place
I put on for my city
All my brothers with me
Really gotta question this

[Chorus]
Do you got friends for my friends, too?
'Cause they all want it bad, girl, just like you, you
Do you got friends for my friends, too?
'Cause they all want it bad, girl, just like you, you

[Bridge]
Do you got friends, yeah, friends?
'Cause I can't keep 'em waiting, oh
I'm losing all my patience, oh
Do you got friends?

[Chorus]
Do you got friends for my friends, too?
'Cause they all want it bad, girl, just like you, you
Do you got friends for my friends, too?
'Cause they all want it bad, girl, just like you, you
Do you got friends?

[Verse]
Hair done up high
Dressed to the nines
Tell me what is a man supposed to do
With that Gucci black dress
And pearls 'round your neck
Thinking 'bout how they would look upon my floor
So by any little chance
You wanna take a chance
We could close up our tab, hit the road
Baby, let's go

[Chorus]
Girl, fuck the club 
Leave here with me 
'Cause you look too fine to be waiting in line
Just to hear the same song a thousand times
The same old pick-up lines
Girl, fuck the club 
Leave here with me 
'Cause you look too good to be misunderstood
'Cause the music is turned up way too loud
Can you hear me now?
Fuck this club

[Verse 1]
For you I travel 'cross the world
20 hours in a plane just 'cause you my girl
Wanna see you smile; fuck the diamonds and the pearls
Promise me your pretty heart will never ever change
Promise me your pretty soul will always stay the same
Hope that one day I can see your ass like all the time
Wake up in the morning; wish you right here by my side
See all of these boys holler at you all the time
You were lookin' at these boys like it's funny that they...

[Chorus]
Try, yeah, yeah
I hope all of your dreams come true, yeah, yeah
I hope I get to see you improve, yeah, yeah
Even though for you, that's a tough thing to do
'Cause look at you, look at you, look at you

[Post-Chorus]
(Look at you, look at you, look at you
Look at you, look at you, look at you)
Look at you, look at you 
Look at you, look at you

[Outro]
Happy Birthday

[Chorus: Bazzi]
Drip too hard, don't stand too close
You gon' fuck around and drown off this wave
Doin' all these shows, I've been on the road
Don't care where I go, long as I get paid
Bad lil' vibe, she been on my mind
Soon as I get back, she gettin' slayed, oh, yeah
Every other night, another movie gettin' made

[Verse]
I been on the feel, do this shit for real
Happy every meal, she never not feelin'
Like a Navy SEAL, going for the kill, going for the kill, oh
Back and forth with a waterfall
Stephen Curry with the way I ball
Rich and thirsty with the way they call
Bitch, I'm focused, no Adderall
Every other night, another movie gettin' made
Henny and my enemies mixin' up a lemonade
She get really rowdy, wanna step up on the stage
Ballin' for a livin' like I'm in the NBA

[Verse 1]
You so fuckin' precious when you smile, yeah
Hit it from the back and drive you wild, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Girl, I lose myself up in those eye-eye-eye-eye-eyes, yuh
I just had to let you know you're mine

[Chorus]
Hands on your body, I don't wanna waste no time
Feels like forever even if forever's tonight
Just lay with me, waste this night away with me
You're mine, I can't look away, I just gotta say

[Post-Chorus]
Ooo, yeah, huh-uh, mine
From the back and, huh-uh mine, I just gotta say
Ooo, mine, yeah, mine, yeah
Ooo, mine, from the back and, mine, I just gotta say
Mine, mine, I just gotta say

[Verse 2]
I'm so fucking happy you're alive, huh-uh, yeah
Swear to God I'm down if you're down all you gotta say is right, yeah-uh
Girl anything I can do just to make you feel alright
Oh, oh, oh, oh, I just had to let you know you're fine, ah
Running circles 'round my mind
Even when it's rainy all you ever do is shine
You on fire, you a star just like Mariah
Man this feel incredible, I'll turn you into a bride, you're mine

[Chorus]
Oh, hands on your body, I don't wanna waste no time
Feels like forever even if forever's tonight
Just lay with me, waste this night away with me
You're mine, I can't look away, I just gotta say

[Post-Chorus]
Ooo, yeah, huh-uh, mine
From the back and, huh-uh mine, I just gotta say
Ooo, mine, yeah, mine, yeah
Ooo, mine, from the back and, mine, I just gotta say
Mine, mine[Lyrics from Snippet]
Tonight, I, I swear
In those eyes, I feel it all over
Inside her, losing composure
I'm holding on for my life
Drowning in those eyes
I'm shaking, pulling me closer
We played it twenty times over
I'm holding on for my life
Drowning in those eyes

[Intro: AJ]
Yeah, eh, eh

[Verse 1: Brian & Nick]
You are my fire
The one desire
Believe when I say
I want it that way
But we are two worlds apart
Can't reach to your heart
When you say
That I want it that way

[Chorus: Nick & All]
Tell me why
Ain't nothing but a heartache
Tell me why
Ain't nothing but a mistake
Tell me why
I never want to hear you say
I want it that way

[Verse 2: AJ, with Brian]
Am I your fire?
Your one desire
Yes, I know it's too late
But I want it that way

[Chorus: AJ, All & Brian]
Tell me why
Ain't nothing but a heartache
Tell me why
Ain't nothing but a mistake
Tell me why
I never want to hear you say
I want it that way

[Bridge 1: Kevin with AJ]
Now I can see that we're falling apart
From the way that it used to be, yeah
No matter the distance, I want you to know
That deep down inside of me

[Interlude: Howie]
You are my fire
The one desire
You are 

[Bridge 2: Nick & All]
Don't wanna hear you say
Ain't nothin' but a heartache
Ain't nothin' but a mistake 
I never wanna hear you say 
I want it that way

[Chorus: Brian, All,  & AJ]
Tell me why
Ain't nothing but a heartache
Tell me why
Ain't nothing but a mistake
Tell me why
I never want to hear you say 
I want it that way
Tell me why
Ain't nothin' but a heartache
Ain't nothin' but a mistake
Tell me why
I never want to hear you say 
I want it that way

[Outro: AJ]
'Cause I want it that way

[Verse 1: Nick Carter]
I got mixed emotions
Did I finally find me a river that could lead me out to the ocean?
'Cause I've only ever known the kind of love
That leaves you battered and broken
So forgive me for my mixed emotions, yeah yeah

[Pre-Chorus: All]
I'm not that kind of person
Who can fall in and out of love with you
That's not what love's supposed to do
I'm not that kind of person
Who can fall in and out of love with you
That's not what love's supposed to do

[Chorus: All]
Baby, don't go breaking my heart, breaking my heart
Baby, don't go breaking my heart, breaking my heart
'Cause it's the only one I've got
'Cause it's the only one I've got

[Verse 2: AJ McLean]
Am I being too open?
'Cause I told you everything I have to say
And now we're having a moment
Does it make you wanna pack up all your things
And drive away like you stole it?
Just forgive me if I'm being too open
No no no no, yeah yeah yeah

[Pre-Chorus: All]
I'm not that kind of person
Who can fall in and out of love with you
That's not what love's supposed to do

I'm not that kind of person
Who can fall in and out of love with you
That's not what love's supposed to do

[Chorus: All]
Baby, don't go breaking my heart, breaking my heart
Baby, don't go breaking my heart, breaking my heart
'Cause it's the only one I've got
'Cause it's the only one I've got
Baby, don't go breaking my heart, breaking my heart
Baby, don't go breaking my heart, breaking my heart
'Cause it's the only one I've got
'Cause it's the only one I've got

[Bridge: Nick Carter]
I've been broken, I've been bruised
But now I'm all in 'cause of you
So if you're gonna love me, love me right, yeah
But if you're gonna be someone that hurts somebody just for fun
Then do it to a heart that isn't mine

[Chorus: All]
Baby, don't go breaking my heart, breaking my heart 
Baby, don't go breaking my heart, breaking my heart 
'Cause it's the only one I've got 
'Cause it's the only one I've got 
Baby, don't go breaking my heart, breaking my heart
Baby, don't go breaking my heart, breaking my heart
'Cause it's the only one I've got
It's the only one, it's the only one I got
'Cause it's the only one I've got 
Baby, don't go

[Intro: All]
As long as you love me

[Verse 1: Nick with Brian]
Although loneliness has always been a friend of mine
I'm leaving my life in your hands
People say I'm crazy and that I am blind
Risking it all in a glance
And how you got me blind is still a mystery
I can't get you out of my head
Don't care what is written in your history
As long as you're here with me

[Chorus: All]
I don't care, who you are, where you're from
What you did as long as you love me
Who you are, where you're from
Don't care what you did as long as you love me

[Verse 2: Brian with Kevin]
Every little thing that you have said and done
Feels like it's deep within me 
Doesn't really matter if you're on the run
It seems like we're meant to be

[Chorus: All & ]
I don't care, who you are, where you're from

What you did as long as you love me 
Who you are, where you're from

Don't care what you did as long as you love me
Yeah, as long as you love me

[Bridge: Brian, All & Nick]
I've tried to hide it so that no one knows
But I guess it shows when you look into my eyes
What you did and where you're coming from
I don't care as long as you love me, baby
Woo, woo, woo, ooh

[Chorus: All & ]
I don't care, who you are, where you're from

What you did, as long as you love me

Who you are, where you're from

Don't care what you did, as long as you love me


[Outro: All,  & Nick]
Who you are 
Where you're from
What you did as long as you love me
Who you are 
Where you're from, where you're from
As long as you love me
Who you are, as long as you love me
What you did, I don't care
As long as you love me

[Verse 1: Brian]
What if I never run into you?
What if you never smiled at me?
What if I had noticed you too?
And you never showed up where I happened to be

[Pre-Chorus: Nick]
What's a girl like you doing in a place like this?
On a quiet night, what are the odds?
What's a guy like me doing in a place like this?
I could have just walked by, who would have thought?

[Chorus: Brian]
What are the chances that we'd end up dancing?
Like two in a million, like once in a life
I could have found you, put my arms around you
Like two in a million, like once in a life
What are the chances?

[Verse 2: AJ]
What if I hadn't asked for your name?
And time hadn't stopped when you said it to me? Oh
Of all of the plans that I could have made
Of all of the nights that I couldn't sleep, oh

[Pre-Chorus: AJ and Nick]
What's a girl like you doing in a place like this?
In a crowded room, what are the odds?

Getting close to you, but here we are

[Chorus: Nick]
What are the chances that we'd end up dancing?
Like two in a million, like once in a life
That I could have found you, put my arms around you
Like two in a million, like once in a life
What are the chances?

[Bridge: Howie and Kevin]
Is it love? Is it fate?
Who am I? Who's to say?
Don't know exactly what it means 
''Is it love? Is it fate?''
''Where it leads, who can say?''
''Maybe you and I were meant to be''

[Chorus: Nick and Brian]
What, what
What are the chances that we'd end up dancing?
Two in a million, once in a life
That I could have found you, put my arms around you 
Two in a million , once in a life, yeah 
What are the chances? 
Two in a million, once in a life
What are the chances? 
Two in a million, once in a life

[Outro: Brian]
What if I never run into you?
And what if you never smiled at me?

[Verse 1]
I've been to Paris, made my way down to Rome
Seen the sun setting on the beach in Mexico
But I could care less, 'cause I was all alone
And there ain't no way to touch your body over the phone

[Chorus]
I've been all around the world, done all there is to do
But you'll always be the home I wanna come home to
You're a wild night with a hell of a view
There ain't no place, ain't no place like you
There ain't no place, ain't no place like you

[Verse 2]
You're my daybreak, you're my California sun
You're my Memphis, New York, New Orleans all rolled into one
In the city, the country, the mountains or sea
Wherever you are, baby, that's where I wanna be

[Chorus]
I've been all around the world, done all there is to do
But you'll always be the home I wanna come home to
You're a wild night with a hell of a view
There ain't no place, ain't no place like you
There ain't no place, ain't no place like you, no

[Bridge]
There ain't no place 
Ooh, yeah, ain't no place
Wherever you are, baby, that's where I wanna be

[Chorus]
I've been all around the world, done all there is to do
But you'll always be the home I wanna come home to
You're a wild night with a hell of a view
There ain't no place, ain't no place like you
There ain't no place, ain't no place like you
Said there ain't no place, ain't no place like you, yeah

[Outro]
There ain't no place 
No place
There ain't no place like
No place like you
No place, no place, no place, no place
There ain't no place, no place like you

[Intro: All]
Show me the meaning of being lonely

[Verse 1: Brian & AJ]
So many words for the broken heart
It is hard to see in a crimson love
So hard to breathe
Walk with me, and maybe
Nights of light so soon become
Wild and free I could feel the sun
Your every wish will be done
They tell me

[Chorus: All]
Show me the meaning of being lonely
Is this the feeling I need to walk with
Tell me why I cannot be there where you are?
There is something missing in my heart

[Verse 2: Kevin & Nick]
Life goes on as it never ends
Eyes of stone observe the trends
They never say forever gaze upon me
Guilty roads to an endless love 
There is no control, are you with me now?
Your every wish will be done
They tell me

[Chorus: All]
Show me the meaning of being lonely
Is this the feeling I need to walk with 
Tell me why I cannot be there where you are?
There is something missing in my heart

[Bridge: Howie, All & Brian]
There is nowhere to run
I have no place to go
Surrender my heart, body, and soul
How can it be you are asking me
To feel the things you never show?
You are missing in my heart
Tell me why can't I be there where you are?

[Chorus: All, Brian & Nick]
Show me the meaning of being lonely
Is this the feeling I need to walk with 
Tell me why I cannot be there where you are? 
There is something missing in my heart

Show me the meaning of being lonely 
Is this the feeling I need to walk with
Tell me why I cannot be there where you are? 
There is something missing in my heart

[Verse 1: Brian]
Mmmmh! Yeah, yeah
Baby, please try to forgive me
Stay here don't put out the glow 
Hold me now don't bother
If every minute it makes me weaker
You can save me from the man that I've become, oh yeah

[Chorus: All]
Looking back on the things I've done
I was trying to be someone
I played my part, kept you in the dark
Now let me show you the shape of my heart

[Verse 2: A.J.]
Sadness is beautiful, loneliness that's tragical
So help me I can't win this war, oh no
Touch me now, don't bother
If every second it makes me weaker
You can save me from the man I've become

[Chorus: All]
Looking back on the things I've done
I was trying to be someone
I played my part, kept you in the dark
Now let me show you the shape of my heart

[Bridge: Nick]
I'm here with my confession
Got nothing to hide no more
I don't know where to start
But to show you the shape of my heart

[Chorus: All]
I'm lookin' back on things I've done
I never wanna play the same old part
I'll keep you in the dark 
Now let me show you the shape of my heart
Looking back on the things I've done
I was trying to be someone 
I played my part, kept you in the dark
Now let me show you the shape of my heart
Looking back on the things I've done
I was trying to be someone
I played my part, kept you in the dark
Now let me show you the shape of

Show you the shape of my heart

[Intro: AJ]
Oh yeah

[Verse 1: Brian]
Don't pretend you're sorry
I know you're not
You know you got the power
To make me weak inside
Girl, you leave me breathless, but it's okay
'Cause you are my survival
Now hear me say

[Pre-Chorus: Howie]
I can't imagine life without your love
Even forever don't seem like long enough

[Chorus: All]
'Cause every time I breathe, I take you in
And my heart beats again
Baby, I can't help it
You keep me drowning in your love
Every time I try to rise above
I'm swept away by love
Baby, I can't help it
You keep me drowning in your love

[Verse 2: AJ]
Maybe I'm a drifter, maybe not
'Cause I have known the safety
Of floating freely in your arms
I don't need another lifeline
It's not for me
'Cause only you can save me
Oh, can't you see

[Pre-Chorus: Nick, ]
I can't imagine life without your love
And even forever don't seem like long enough


[Chorus: All]
'Cause every time I breathe, I take you in
And my heart beats again
Baby, I can't help it
You keep me drowning in your love
Every time I try to rise above
I'm swept away by love
Baby, I can't help it
You keep me drowning in your love

[Bridge: Kevin]
Go on and pull me under
Cover me with dreams, yeah
Love me mouth to mouth now
You know I can't resist
'cause you're the air that I breathe

[Chorus: All]
Every time I breathe, I take you in

And my heart beats again
Baby, I can't help it 
You keep me drowning in your love
Every time I try to rise above
I'm swept away by love
Baby, I can't help it
You keep me drowning in your love

[Bridge: All]
Baby, I can't help it
Keep me drowning in your love 
Oh, got me drowning 
Baby, I can't help it 
Can't help it no, no

[Chorus: All]
Every time I breathe, I take you in 
And my heart beats again
Baby, I can't help it 
You keep me drowning in your love
Every time I try to rise above
I'm swept away by love
Baby, I can't help it
You keep me drowning in your love

[Intro: Brian]
Baby, oh

[Verse 1: Brian]
Even in my heart, I see
You're not being true to me
Deep within my soul, I feel
Nothing's like it used to be

[Pre-Chorus: Brian]
Sometimes I wish I could turn back time
Impossible as it may seem
But I wish I could so bad, baby

[Chorus: Brian & All]
Quit playing games with my heart
Quit playing games with my heart 
Before you tear us apart 
Quit playing games with my heart
I should have known from the start
You know you have got to stop 
You are tearing us apart 
Quit playing games with my heart

[Verse 2: Nick]
I live my life the way
To keep you coming back to me
Everything I do is for you
So what is it that you can't see

[Pre-Chorus: Nick]
Sometimes I wish I could turn back time
Impossible as it may seem
But I wish I could so bad, baby
You better

[Chorus: Brian & All]
Quit playing games with my heart
Quit playing games with my heart 
Before you tear us apart 
Quit playing games with my heart
I should have known from the start
You know you have got to stop 
You are tearing us apart 
Quit playing games

[Bridge: AJ, Brian & All]
Baby, baby, the love that we had was so strong
Don't leave me hanging here forever
Oh baby, baby this is not alright
Let's stop this tonight
Baby, oh
Quit playing games
Na na na na na na
Na na na na na na, baby
Na na na na na na

[Pre-Chorus: Brian]
Sometimes I wish I could turn back time
Impossible as it may seem
But I wish I could so bad, baby

[Chorus: Brian & All]
Quit playing games with my heart

Before you tear us apart 
Quit playing games with my heart
I should have known from the start
You know you have got to stop 
You are tearing us apart 
Quit playing games with my heart

[Outro: Brian & All]
Quit playing games with my heart
Na na na na na na
Na na na na na, baby
Na na na na na na
Quit playing games with my heart
Na na na na na na
With my heart
Na na na na na, baby
My heart, my heart

[Verse 1: A.J.]
Empty spaces fill me up with holes
Distant faces with no place left to go
Without you within me I can't find no rest
Where Im going is anybodys guess

[Chorus: Nick]
I tried to go on like I never knew you
Im awake, but my world is half asleep
I pray for this heart to be unbroken
But without you all Im going to be is incomplete

[Verse 2: A.J.]
Voices tell me I should carry on
But I am swimming in an ocean all alone
Baby, my baby
Its written on your face
You still wonder if we made a big mistake

[Chorus: All]
I tried to go on like I never knew you
Im awake but my world is half asleep
I pray for this heart to be unbroken
But without you all Im going to be is incomplete

[Bridge: A.J.]
I dont mean to drag it on, but I cant seem to let you go
I dont want to make you face this world alone
I want to let you go 

[Chorus: All]
I tried to go on like I never knew you
Im awake but my world is half asleep
I pray for this heart to be unbroken
But without you all Im going to be is incomplete

[Outro: Nick]
Incomplete

[Verse 1: Brian & Nick]
I'm yours completely
I feel so deeply
You're my first thought every day
And I want it that way
My life is for you
And I adore you
I love you more everyday
And I want it that way

[Chorus: Nick, All]
No goodbyes
Ain't nothing but a heartache
No more lies
Ain't nothing but a mistake
That is why
I love it when I hear you say
I want it that way

[Verse 2: AJ]
My heart is on fire
Such a strong desire
Yes I know it's too late
But I want it that way

[Chorus: AJ, All, Brian]
No goodbyes
Ain't nothing but a heartache
No more lies
Ain't nothing but a mistake
That is why
I love it when I hear you say
I want it that way

[Bridge: Kevin]
I gave you my heart
Baby right from the start
And that's the way it will always be, yeah
No matter the distance
I want you to know
That deep down inside of me

[Interlude: Howie]
You are my fire
The one desire
You are 

[Nick]
Don't want to hear you say

[Chorus ]
Ain't nothing but a heartache
Ain't nothing but a mistake 
I love it when I hear you say 
You want it that way

Ain't nothing but a heartache

Ain't nothing but a mistake
That is why

[Intro]
"Hello"
"Hi, it's me. Wassup baby?
I'm sorry, listen
I'm gonna be late tonight so don't stay up and wait for me, okay?"
"Where are you?"
"Say that again?"
"Hello?"
"You're really dropping out. I think my battery must be low
Listen, if you can hear me, we're going to a place nearby, alright? Gotta go!"

[Verse 1: AJ]
Let me tell you the story
'Bout the call that changed my destiny
Me and my boys went out just to end up in misery
Was about to go home
When there she was, standing in front of me
And said, "Hi, I got a little place nearby, wanna go?"
I should've said, "No, someone's waiting for me"
But I called my girl up and said

[Chorus: All]
"Listen, baby, I'm sorry
Just wanna tell ya don't worry
I will be late, don't stay up and wait for me"
"Say again? You're dropping out, my battery is low
Just so you know, we're going to a place nearby
Gotta go!"

[Verse 2: Nick]
Now two years gone, nothing's been won
I can't take it back, what's done is done
One of her friends found out that she wasn't my only one
And it eats me from inside that she's not by my side
Just because I made that call and lied

[Chorus: All]
"Listen, baby, I'm sorry
Just wanna tell ya don't worry
I will be late, don't stay up and wait for me"
"Say again? You're dropping out, my battery is low
Just so you know, we're going to a place nearby
Gotta go!"

[Bridge: All]
Listen baby I'm sorry 
Listen baby I'm sorry 
Gotta go
Oh, oh
Oh, oh

[Reprise: AJ]
Let me tell you the story
'Bout the call that changed my destiny
Me and my boys went out just to end up in misery
Was about to go home
When there she was, standing in front of me
And said, "Hi, I got a little place nearby"
Gotta go

[Chorus: All]
"Listen, baby, I'm sorry
Just wanna tell ya don't worry
I will be late, don't stay up and wait for me"
"Say again? You're dropping out, my battery is low
Just so you know, we're going to a place nearby
Gotta go!"
"Listen, baby, I'm sorry
Just wanna tell ya don't worry
I will be late, don't stay up and wait for me"
"Say again? You're dropping out, my battery is low
Just so you know, we're going to a place nearby
We're going to a place nearby
Gotta go!"

[Intro: AJ]
Hmm!
Yeah-ha-ha-ha-ha, woah
Ha-ha-ha-ha

[Verse 1: Brian & Nick]
I may run and hide
When you're screaming my name, alright!
But let me tell you now
There are prices to fame, alright!

[Pre-Chorus: AJ]
All of our time spent
In flashes of light-ight-ight-ight

[Chorus: All]
All you people can't you see, can't you see
How your love's affecting our reality
Every time we're down, you can make it right
And that makes you larger than life
Alright

[Verse 2: Nick & Brian]
Looking at the crowd
And I see your body sway, come on!
Wishing I could thank you
In a different way, come on!

[Pre-Chorus: AJ]
'Cause all of your time spent
Keeps us alive, yeah, hey, ah, ah

[Chorus: All]
All you people can't you see, can't you see
How your love's affecting our reality
Every time we're down, you can make it right
And that makes you larger than life

[Bridge: AJ & All]
Larger than life
Yeah, haha, that's right
All of your time spent
Keeps us alive-ive-ive-ive-ive, yeah
Every time we're down
You can make it right

[Chorus: All]
All you people, can't you see, can't you see
How your love's affecting our reality
Every time we're down, you can make it right
And that makes you larger than life

[Interlude: All & AJ]
Yeah, every time we're down
Yeah, you can make it right
Yeah, that's what makes you larger than life
Yeah, yeah

[Chorus: All & ]
All you people, can't you see, can't you see
How your love's affecting our reality
Every time we're down, you can make it right
And that makes you larger than life

That makes you larger
That makes you larger than life

[Intro]
Ooh
Do-do-do-do-do
Do-do-do-do-do
Ooh
Do-do-do-do-do

[Verse 1]
Sand keeps slipping right through my hands
Days all feel the same, still numb from you
First step off of this plane, I knew
I suffocate without you, heart beats for two

[Pre-Chorus]
It was good 
What we had 
Yeah, that was better times
Can somebody take me back? 
And it hurts 
Looking back 
If this is for the best
Then tell me why it hurts so bad 

[Chorus]
Don't let go when the daylight's gone
'Cause it's always darkest before the dawn
I breathe, oh
When the cold air starts filling up my lungs
And I hate the things that I've become
I breathe, oh

[Post-Chorus]
Ooh
Do-do-do-do-do
Do-do-do-do-do
Ooh, ooh
Do-do-do-do-do

[Verse 2]
Regrets dancing around my head, everything I never said
Still numb from you 
Secrets sleeping all over this bed 
Memories of what we did 
Got mixed with you 

[Pre-Chorus]
And it hurts 
Looking back 
If this is for the best
Then tell me why it hurts so bad 

[Chorus]
Don't let go when the daylight's gone 
'Cause it's always darkest before the dawn
I breathe 
When the cold air starts filling up my lungs 
And I hate the things that I've become
I breathe 

[Post-Chorus]
Ooh
Do-do-do-do-do
Do-do-do-do-do
Ooh, ooh
Breathe 
Ooh
Do-do-do-do-do
Do-do-do-do-do
Ooh, ooh
Breathe

[Outro]
Sand keeps slipping right through my hands
Days all feel the same, still numb from you

[Verse 1: Nick & Brian]
I don't know what he does to make you cry
But I'll be there to make you smile
I don't have a fancy car
To get to you I'd walk a thousand miles
I don't care if he buys you nice things
Does his gifts come from the heart?
I don't know, but if you were my girl
I'd make it so we'd never be apart

[Chorus: Brian & All]
But my love is all I have to give
Without you I don't think I could live
I wish I could give the world to you
But love is all I have to give

[Verse 2: Howie & AJ]
When you talk, does it seem like he's not
Even listening to a word you say?
That's okay, babe, just tell me your problems
I'll try my best to kiss them all away
Does he leave when you need him the most?
Does his friends get all your time?
Baby, please, I'm on my knees
Praying for the day that you'll be mine

[Chorus: AJ & All]
But my love is all I have to give
Without you I don't think I could live
I wish I could give the world to you
But love is all I have to give
Oh, to you

[Bridge: Nick, Howie, Brian, , Kevin & ]
Hey, girl
I don't want you to cry no more inside
All the money in the world
Could never add up to

And I will give it to you


You're the one I need

All that I have to give


[Chorus: Brian, AJ & All]
But my love is all I have to give
My love is all
Without you I don't think I could live
I don't think that I can live without you
I wish I could give the world to you
But love is all I have to give
It's all that I have
But my love is all I have to give
Without you I don't think I could live
I wish I could give the world to you
But love is all I have to give

[Outro: Nick, Brian & All]
To you, oooh
I have to give
Without you I don't think I could live
Give the world to you, baby
But love is all I have to give
That's all I got to give
But my love is all I have to give
Yeah, yeah
Without you I don't think I could live
I wish I could give the world to you
But love is all I have to give

[Intro]
Oh yeah
Oh, oh, oh yeah
Oh, oh, oh, oh yeah

Who are you, the sex police?
My sex ain't got no rules
Got a million options next to me, yeah
Let me do what I do

[Pre-Chorus]
And I call it new love, new love, new love
And I call it new love, new love, new love
And I call it new love, new love, new love
Ne-e-e-ew love

Don't say it's the wrong thing
'Cause it don't feel like the wrong thing

And I call it new love
Oh, oh, oh yeah
Oh, oh, oh, oh yeah

In any dark room, ooh, ooh
And I don't wanna know your name 
Just let me do what I do, ooh yeah, baby 

[Pre-Chorus]
And I call it new love , new love , new love
And I call it new love , new love , new love 
And I call it new love , new love , new love 
Ne-e-e-ew love

[Chorus]
Don't say it's the wrong thing 
'Cause it don't feel like the wrong thing 
I stay on my own thing 
That night bein' a long thing 

[Bridge]
It's only love, it ain't official
No expectations, only here and now
Baby, we're in this thing together
You and I don't feel like the wrong thing, yeah 

[Chorus]
Don't say it's the wrong thing 

'Cause it don't feel like the wrong thing 

I stay on my own thing 

That night bein' a long thing, yeah 


[Post-Chorus]
And I call it new love, new love, new love 

And I call it new love, new love, new love 

And I call it new love, new love, new love 

'Cause it don't feel like the wrong thing
[Intro: Kevin]
Baby, I know you're hurting
Right now you feel like you could
Never love again
Now all I ask is for a chance
To prove that I love you

[Verse 1: AJ & Brian]
From the first day
That I saw your smiling face
Honey, I knew that we would
Be together forever
Ooh, when I asked you out
You said no, but I found out
Darling that you'd been hurt
You thought that you'd never love again

[Pre-Chorus: Brian & AJ]
I deserve a try honey just once
Give me a chance and I'll prove this all wrong
You walked in, you were so quick to judge
But honey, he's nothing like me

[Chorus: All & ]
I'll never break your heart
I'll never make you cry
I'd rather die than live without you
I'll give you all of me 
Honey, that's no lie 
I'll never break your heart

I'll never make you cry 
I'd rather die than live without you

I'll give you all of me
Honey, that's no lie

[Verse 2: AJ, Brian & All]
As time goes by
You will get to know me a little more better
Girl, that's the way love goes baby, baby
And I, I know you're afraid 
To let your feelings show 
And I understand
Girl, it's time to let go, ooh
Girl, it's time to let go because

[Pre-Chorus: Brian, AJ & All]
I deserve a try honey, just once
Give me a chance
And I'll prove this all wrong 
You walked in, you were so quick to judge
Quick to judge
But honey he's nothing like me
Darling why can't you see

[Chorus: All, AJ & Brian]
I'll never break your heart
I'll never make you cry 
I'd rather die than live without you

I'll give you all of me 
Honey, that's no lie
I'll never break your heart
I'll never make you cry 
I'd rather die than live without you

I'll give you all of me
Honey, that's no lie

[Bridge: Brian, AJ & All]
I'll never break your heart

No way, know how
Girl, I'll never break your heart
No way, make you cry
I swear, oh believe me
I swear, I swear
Honey, I swear
No way, know how
I'll do your right
Girl, I'll never break your heart
Cause I know how!

[Chorus: All]
I'll never break your heart

I'll never make you cry 
I'd rather die than live without you 
I'll give you all of me 
Honey, that's no lie
I'll never break your heart 
I'll never make you cry 
I'd rather die than live without you 
I'll give you all of me
Honey, that's no lie 

[Verse 1]
Just memorizing lines upon your face
I made a map, every photo and the details on the frames
And just last night we spilled red wine, how it stained the floor
And though I know that nothing ever really stays the same, no

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, if I could stop the hands of that clock
Never let 'em tick, tick, tick
Wherever I go, yeah, I would still know
Even though it's selfish

[Chorus]
I don't wanna share you with no one else, no one else
I can't compare you to no one else, no one else
'Cause people change and memories fade
But could you stay the same, if nothing else?
No, I don't wanna share you with no one else, nobody else

[Verse 2]
Torn by the way your voice is changing on the phone
All this space in between us makes it hard to feel close to you 
And just last night I had some red wine and it brought me back
No matter what I'll remember you forever like that, you know 

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, if I could stop the hands of that clock
And never let 'em tick, tick, tick
Wherever I go, yeah, I would still know
That even though it's selfish, oh

[Chorus]
I don't wanna share you with no one else, no one else
I can't compare you to no one else, no one else
'Cause people change and memories fade
But could you stay the same, if nothing else?
No, I don't wanna share you with no one else, nobody else

[Bridge]

Nobody, nobody, nobody else
Nobody else
Nobody, nobody, nobody else 
'Cause people change and memories fade
But could you stay the same, if nothing else? 
I said people change and memories fade
But could you stay the same, if nothing else? 

[Chorus]
I don't wanna share you with no one else, no one else 
I can't compare you to no one else, no one else 
'Cause people change and memories fade
But could you stay the same, if nothing else? 
No, I don't wanna share you with no one else, nobody else

[Verse 1]
I'm the type of person to get carried away
Been this way since I came out of the womb
A bit obsessive, got that all for me, yeah
Yeah, and God knows I do not like to lose

[Pre-Chorus]
And I want your love, I want your love
I'ma do whatever it takes
And I want your love, I want your love
I know I come on hard, there's no need to be alarmed
It's just I'm...

[Chorus]
Passionate
I can't help it, I need to get my hands on all of it
Need to get my hands on all of it, all, a-all
I'm passionate
I can't help it, I need to get my hands on all of it
Need to get my hands on all of it, all, a-all

[Verse 2]
I never listen to the voice in my head
You know, it's like I got no brakes in my car 
I'm on a mission, gonna sleep when I'm dead
And it's impossible to stop when I start

[Pre-Chorus]
And I want your love , I want your love
I'ma do whatever it takes 
And I want your love , I want your love
I know I come on hard, there's no need to be alarmed
It's just I'm...

[Chorus]
Passionate
I can't help it, I need to get my hands on all of it
Need to get my hands on all of it, all, a-all 
I'm passionate
I can't help it, I need to get my hands on all of it
Need to get my hands on all of it, all, a-all

[Post-Chorus]
Oh, I'm so passionate

[Bridge]
All I want is everything
Too much adrenaline
And all I'll do is anything
But like a gentleman
Singin', all I want is everything
Too much adrenaline
And all I'll do is anything
But like a gentleman

[Chorus]
Passionate
I can't help it, I need to get my hands on all of it
Need to get my hands on all of it, all, a-all
I'm passionate
I can't help it, I need to get my hands on all of it 
Need to get my hands on all of it, all, a-all 

[Post-Chorus]
Yeah
No, no
No, no, no, I'm so passionate, oh
To the beat now, to the beat now

[Outro]
Passionate
I can't help it, I need to get my hands on all of it

Need to get my hands on all of it, all, a-all

I'm passionate
I can't help it, I need to get my hands on all of it

Need to get my hands on all of it, all, a-all
[Verse 1]
I saw you on the corner
You look happy, happier than I do
Your hair's a little longer
Am I crazy, is it blonder than it was than
When you walked out my house?
I didn't say a thing, no
It's funny how a year can fill your head with should've, would've, could've been

[Pre-Chorus]
Took my words, wrote them down, threw them out
And now there's only five left to tell you

[Chorus]
Baby, I want you back
There's a space in my bed
In the shape of your head
I said it, what if I said it?
Baby, I want you back
Would you come back around?
'Cause I need you right now
I said it, there, I said it
Baby, I want you back

[Verse 2]
Would you meet me at the chateau?
At a table, I'd get your favorite chardonnay, yeah
'Cause babe, you know, a bottle is a little bit too much to drink alone
We could catch up, make out, make up
'Cause I don't wanna go 
Another day without you, come on

[Chorus]
Baby, I want you back
There's a space in my bed 
In the shape of your head 
I said it, what if I said it? 
Baby, I want you back 
Would you come back around? 
'Cause I need you right now
I said it, there, I said it 
Baby, I want you back 

[Post-Chorus]
Woah-oh, oh-oh
Woah-oh, oh-oh, at the chateau
Baby, I want you back
Woah-oh, oh-oh
Woah-oh, oh-oh, at the chateau
Baby, I want you back

[Bridge]
Took my words, wrote them down, threw them out
And now there's only five left to tell you

[Chorus]
Baby, I want you back 
There's a space in my bed
In the shape of your head
I said it, what if I said it? 
Baby, I want you back 
Would you come back around?
'Cause I need you right now 
I said it, there, I said it 
Baby, I want you back

[Post-Chorus]
Woah-oh, oh-oh 
Woah-oh, oh-oh, at the chateau
Baby, I want you back
Woah-oh, oh-oh 
Woah-oh, oh-oh, at the chateau
Woah-oh, oh-oh
Woah-oh, oh-oh, at the chateau
Baby, would you meet me at the chateau?
Baby, I want you back 
Woah-oh, oh-oh 
Woah-oh, oh-oh, at the chateau
Baby, I want you back

[Verse 1]
You kiss a little different now
You changed your hair, I like it now
And baby, your body still feels the same
And soon I'll be lying on the floor, picking up the pieces
Drinking it away, pretending I don't need ya
But right now, I'ma hold you like nothing has changed

[Chorus]
I'm going crazy over you 
Over you again, yeah 
It's never gonna be the way it was, oh 
It's never gonna be the way it was
And it's so crazy, what you do 
What you do to me, oh yeah 
This isn't how I remember us 
It's never gonna be the way it was, oh

[Verse 2]
It's a shot to my veins, lying in your bed
Never thought I'd be back with you again
So, do your worst, 'cause you know that I'll always forgive you
Guess I will, guess I will

[Chorus]
I'm going crazy over you 
Over you again, yeah 
It's never gonna be the way it was, oh 
It's never gonna be the way it was
And it's so crazy, what you do 
What you do to me, oh yeah 
This isn't how I remember us 
No, it's never gonna be the way it was, oh 

[Bridge]
You know, I still want you, baby
We both know 
We both know 
We will never be the same

[Chorus]
I'm going crazy over you
Over you again, oh yeah
It's never gonna be the way it was
It's never gonna be the way it was
I'm going crazy over you, babe 
Over you again, baby 
This isn't how I remember us, no, baby 
It's never gonna be the way it was
I'm going crazy, what you do 
What you do to me, baby 
This isn't how I remember us 
No, it's never gonna be the way it was 

[Verse 1]
Used to heatin' up in the shower, at it for hours
Now youre always in a rush
I could be paranoid, but I swear, it's up in the air
Are you fallin' out of love?
The more I think about how we were, the more that Im sure
Sure it wasn't what it was, yeah
We used to be, used to be better 
We used to talk about growing old, now I don't know
If we gon' make it through the month
Don't wanna make it real if it's not, I wish I could stop
With over-overthinking us, yeah
Feelin' like there's nowhere to go, its taking a toll
I dont wanna give you up
But we used to be, used to be better

[Chorus]
Is it just me or did our talks get a little bit shorter?
Is it just me or did the nights get a little bit colder?
When that argument got vulgar
When it should've just blown over
It was nothing, nothing

[Post-Chorus]
Is it just, just me? 
Is it just, just me? 

[Verse 2]
Its 2 A.M., you're not even home, I'm here alone
Callin', but your phone is off
You go and blame it all on your friends, not that again
Need to know whats going on, 'cause
The more I think about how we were, the more that I'm sure
Sure I'm not the only one, yeah
We used to be, used to be better

[Pre-Chorus]
Never forget, night that we met, you had another one
You did it then, you'd do it again, now I'm the other one

[Chorus]
Is it just me or did our talks get a little bit shorter?
Is it just me or did the nights get a little bit colder?
When that argument got vulgar
When it should've just blown over
It was nothing, nothing

[Post-Chorus]
Is it just, just me? 
Is it just, just me? 

[Bridge]
Never forget, night that we met, you had another one
You did it then, you'd do it again, now I'm the other one
Never forget, night that we met, you had another one
You did it then, you'd do it again, now I'm the other one

[Chorus]
Is it just me or 
Did our talks get a little bit shorter?
Is it just me or 
Did the night get a little bit colder?
When that argument got vulgar
When it should've just blown over
It was nothing, nothing 

[Post-Chorus]
Is it just, just me?

Oh, is it just, just me?

Is it just, just me?

Is it just, just me?


[Outro]
Is it just me? Is it, is it?
Is it just me? Is it, is it?

[Verse 1]
July, it's only been a month since I met you
I gotta say that was my favorite June
And I knew from that night that I would be alright

[Pre-Chorus]
If I, I only knew that one day I would find
Someone like you, I'd take back all those nights I wasted
Looking for the right one at the wrong door

[Chorus]
We fit together, you make me better
Whatever it takes, I'm here forever
Bad things'll happen, but none of that matters
We'll find a way, as long as I'm with you, I'm okay

[Verse 2]
Baby, I'm all in it, just tell me you were all in it
People wanna talk, shut 'em all off
And tell 'em all to mind their business
Will for the grumps and cynics
Been that way from the beginning
People see what they don't have
They get sad and act out 'cause they're winning

[Pre-Chorus]
Ooh, I love the way you wanna love me, too
Ooh, eh, eh

[Chorus]
We fit together, you make me better
Whatever it takes, I'm here forever
Bad things'll happen, but none of that matters
We'll find a way, as long as I'm with you, I'm okay

[Post-Chorus]
Nothing else matters
As long as I'm with you, I'm okay
Nothing else matters
As long as I'm with you, I'm okay
Yeah, nothing else matters
And baby, I know, we'll find a way
Eh, eh, as long as I'm with you, I'm okay

[Bridge]
Ooh, I love the way you wanna love me, too
Ooh
Ooh, I love the way you wanna love me, too
Ooh, eh, eh

[Chorus]
We fit together, you make me better
Whatever it takes, I'm here forever
Bad things'll happen, but none of that matters
We'll find a way, as long as I'm with you, I'm okay

[Post-Chorus]
Nothing else matters
As long as I'm with you, I'm okay
Nothing else matters
As long as I'm with you, I'm okay
Yeah, nothing else matters
And baby, I know, we'll find a way
Eh, eh, as long as I'm with you, I'm okay

Oh, we're two shadows in the dark
Nothing between us but a spark
I'll light this night up just like you like it

[Chorus]
Girl, it's all for you, everything I do

Oh, just like you like it

[Intro: All]
I'll be the one

[Verse 1: AJ]
I guess you were lost when I met you
Still there were tears in your eyes
So out of trust and I knew
No more than mysteries and lies

[Pre-Chorus: Brian]
There you are, wild and free
Reaching out like you needed me
A helping hand to make it right
I am holding you all through the night

[Chorus: All]
I'll be the one 
Who will make all your sorrows undone
I'll be the light 
When you feel like there's nowhere to run
I'll be the one

[Verse 2: Nick]
To hold you
And make sure that you'll be alright
'Cause my faith is gone
And I want to take you from darkness to light

[Pre-Chorus: AJ]
There you are, wild and free
Reaching out like you needed me
A helping hand to make it right
I am holding you all through the night

[Chorus: All]
I'll be the one 
Who will make all your sorrows undone
I'll be the light 
When you feel like there's nowhere to run
I'll be the one

[Verse 3: Nick & Brian]
To hold you
And make sure that you'll be alright
You need me like I need you
We can share our dreams coming true
I can show you what true love means
Just take me hand, baby please

[Bridge: All]
I'll be the one
I'll be the light
Where you can run
To make it alright
I'll be the one
I'll be the light
Where you can run

[Chorus: All]
I'll be the one 
Who will make all your sorrows undone
I'll be the light 
When you feel like there's nowhere to run
I'll be the one

[Bridge: All]
I'll be the one
I'll be the light
Where you can run
To make it alright

I'll be the light
Where you can run
To make it alright

[Outro: All, Nick & AJ]
I'll be the one
To hold you
And make sure that you will be alright
I'll be the one

[Verse 1: Brian & AJ]
I can see that you've been crying
You can't hide it with a lie
What's the use in you denying
That what you have is wrong?
I heard him promise you forever
But forever's come and gone
Baby, he would say whatever
It takes to keep you blind
To the truth between the lines

[Chorus: All & Nick]
Oh, I will love you more than that
I won't say the words, then take them back
Don't give loneliness a chance
Baby, listen to me when I say
I will love you more than that

[Verse 2: Nick]
Baby, you deserve much better
What's the use in holding on?
Don't you see it's now or never
'Cause I just can't be friends
Baby, knowing in the end

[Chorus: All]
That I will love you more than that
I won't say the words, then take them back

Don't give loneliness a chance
Baby, listen to me when I say

[Bridge: All, AJ & Brian]
There's not a day that passes by
I don't wonder why we haven't tried
It's not too late to change your mind
So take my hand, don't say goodbye
I will love you more than that
I won't say the words, then take them back

[Chorus: All & Brian]
I will love you more than that
I won't say the words, then take them back
Don't give loneliness a chance
Baby, listen to me when I say
I will love you more than that
I will love you more than that 
I won't say the words, then take them back
Don't give loneliness a chance
Baby, listen to me when I say
I will love you more than thatYou're the one for me, you're my ecstasy

[Intro]
Do-do-don't want you back
Hey, yeah

[Verse 1: AJ & Nick]
You hit me faster than a shark attack
You saw my picture on the Backstreet's Back, alright
And you were more than just a pretty face
But how you fooled me, I'm still amazed, babe
But I should have known that I would be
Another victim of your sexuality
But now we're done and over with
Do-do-don't want you back

[Chorus: All]
Don't want you back
'Cause you're no good for me, I know
That's all I can say
Don't want you back
Forgive my honesty, but you gotta go
I, I don't want you back

[Verse 2: AJ]
You started going out with so-called friends
But I was blind and so I lost all common sense
But there were things that made me realize 
Like all the hundred no, thousand lies

[Chorus: All & Brian]
Don't want you back
'Cause you're no good for me, I know
That is all I can say
Don't want you back
Forgive my honesty, but you gotta go 
I, I don't want you back

I, I don't want you back
That's right

[Bridge: Brian, Nick & All]
Baby, don't bother telling me your reasons why
Just let us sing this story 'bout you and I
Don't want you back
That's all I know
Don't want you back, don't want you back
All I can say, don't want you back
You know you gotta go

[Chorus: All]
Don't want you back
'Cause you're no good for me, I know
That is all I can say
Don't want you back
Forgive my honesty, but you gotta go
I, I don't want you back

[Outro: All]
Don't want you back
That's all I know
That's all I can say
Don't want you back
You know you gotta go
I, I don't want you back

[Intro: Nick]
Oh, yeah

[Verse 1: Nick]
Open up your heart to me
And say what's on your mind, oh yes
I know that we have been through so much pain
But I still need you in my life, this time

[Chorus: Nick]
And I need you tonight
I need you right now
I know deep within my heart
It doesn't matter if it's wrong or right
I really need you tonight

[Verse 2: Nick]
I figured out what to say to you
Sometimes the words they, they come out so wrong

And I know in time that you will understand
That what we have is so right, this time

[Chorus: Nick]
And I need you tonight
I need you right now
I know deep within my heart
It doesn't matter if it's wrong or right

Backstreet's back alrightShow me the meaning of being lonely
So many words for the broken heart
It's hard to see in a crimson love
So hard to breathe
Walk with me and maybe
Nights of light so soon become
Wild and free, I could feel the sun
Your every wish will be done
They tell me
Show me the meaning of being lonely
Is this the feeling I need to walk with?
Tell me why I can't be there where you are
There's something missing in my heart
Life goes on as it never ends
Eyes of stone observe the trends
They never say, forever gaze, if only
Beauty roams to an endless love
There's no control, are you with me now?
Your every wish will be done
They tell me
Show me the meaning of being lonely
Is this the feeling I need to walk with?
Tell me why I can't be there where you are
There's something missing in my heart
There's nowhere to run, I have no place to go
Surrender my heart, body and soul
How can it be you're asking me
To feel the things you never show?
Tell me why can't I be there where you are
Show me the meaning of being lonely
Is this the feeling I need to walk with?
Tell me why I can't be there where you are
There's something missing in my heart
Show me the meaning of being lonely
Is this the feeling I need to walk with?
Tell me why I can't be there where you are
There's something missing in my heart

[Verse 1: Nick & Brian]
I close the door
Like so many times, so many times before
Filmed like a scene on the cutting room floor
I want to let you walk away tonight without a word
I try to sleep, yeah
But the clock is stuck on thoughts of you and me
A thousand more regrets unraveling
Oh, if you were here right now
I swear I'd tell you this

[Chorus: All & Brian]
Baby, I do not want to waste another day
Keeping it inside, it is killing me
Cause all I ever wanted comes right down to you, to you
I wish that I could find the words to say
Baby I'ma tell you, every time you leave
I am inconsolable

[Verse 2: AJ]
I climb the walls 
I can see the edge, but I cannot take the fall 
I have memorized the number
So why can't I make the call?
Maybe cause I know you will always be with me
In the possibility

[Chorus: All]
Baby, I do not want to waste another day
Keeping it inside, it is killing me
Cause all I ever wanted comes right down to you, to you
I wish that I could find the words to say
Baby I'ma tell you, every time you leave
I am inconsolable


[Bridge: Howie, Nick & Brian]
I don't want to be like this
I just want to let you know
Everything that I hold in
Is everything I can't let go
Oooh, can't let go
Yeah, cause baby

[Chorus: All & Nick]
Baby, I do not want to waste another day
Keeping it inside, it is killing me
Cause all I ever wanted comes right down to you, to you

I wish that I could find the words to say
Baby I'ma tell you, every time you leave
I am inconsolable

[Outro: Howie, Nick,  & All]
Don't you know it baby
I don't want to waste another day
I wish that I could find the words to say
Baby I'ma tell you, every time you leave

[Intro: AJ]
Get another boyfriend
Backstreet
Check it, uh
Hey, yeah

[Verse 1: AJ]
Let's talk about one
Baby, you gotta hear me out
Do you really wanna be
The last to know what it's all about?
Let's talk about two
You say he's the essence of your life
But he'll eat you up from inside slow
And then he doesn't wanna know

[Pre-Chorus: Brian]
I'm telling you, he'll eat you up from inside
And then he doesn't wanna know

[Chorus: All]
Listen, I mean it
There's nothing that he's worthy of
He's just another player
Playing in the name of love
I've seen enough
Now this must come to an end
Get another boyfriend

[Verse 2: Nick]
Let's talk about what
He's done to become your number one
Or was it all the promises of diamonds
Pearls and party dresses that turned you on?
I've seen it before  anymore
Free, too, you're through for sure
Just go get on wit' your life
 acting like you've given up

[Pre-Chorus: Brian]
I'm telling you, go get on with your life
Stop acting like you've given up

[Chorus: All & ]
Listen, I mean it
There's nothing that he's worthy of
He's just another player
Playing in the name of love
I've seen enough
Now this must come to an end

Get another boyfriend

[Post-Chorus: All & AJ]
Why? Yeah
Why? Get another boyfriend
Why? Why?
Stop, hey, yeah

[Bridge: All]
Hear me out
You must know what it's all about 
He's just a player in love, this must come to an end
Get another boyfriend

[Chorus: All & ]
Listen, I mean it 
There's nothing that he's worthy of

He's just another player
Playing in the name of love 
I've seen enough
Now this must come to an end

Listen, I mean it 
There's nothing that he's worthy of
He's just another player
Playing in the name of love
I've seen enough
Now this must come to an end
Get another boyfriend
Get another boyfriend

[Intro: AJ]
No, oh, oh

[Verse 1: Nick]
I never thought that I would lose my mind
That I could control this
Never thought that I would be left behind
That I was stronger than you, baby
Girl, if only I knew what I have done
You know, so why do not you tell me 
I would bring down the moon and the sun
To show how much I care

[Chorus: All]
Don't want to lose you now
Baby, I know we can win this
Don't want to lose you now
No no, or ever again

[Verse 2: Brian w/Kevin]
I have got this feeling you are not going to stay
It is burning within me
The fear of losing of slipping away
It keeps getting closer, baby
Whatever reason to live that I have had
My place was always beside you
And I wish that I didn't need you so bad
Your face just won't go away

[Chorus: All]
Don't want to lose you now
Baby, I know we can win this
Don't want to lose you now
No no, or ever again
Don't want to lose you now

[Bridge: AJ]
I never thought that I would lose my mind
That I could control this, yeah
Never thought that I'd be left behind
That I was stronger than you, oh

[Chorus: All]
Don't want to lose to loneliness
Girl, I know we can win
Don't want to lose to emptiness, oh no
Never again
Don't want to lose you now
Don't want to lose to loneliness
Baby, I know we can win this
Girl, I know we can win
Don't want to lose you now
Don't want to lose to emptiness, oh no
No no, or ever again
Never again
Don't want to lose you now
I know we can win this
Don't want to lose you now
Don't want to lose you now
No no, or ever again
Don't want to lose you now

[Verse 1: Brian]
We've been through days of thunder
Some people said we don't belong
They try to pull us under
But here we stand together and a million strong

[Pre-Chorus: All,  & Brian]
Let's get on with the show

Turn the lights down low

You were there from the start 
We know who you are
And this one goes out to...

[Chorus: All & Brian]
Everyone, everyone, everyone 
And this one goes out to you
Everyone, we're standing strong
'Cause of what you've done
And this one goes out to you

[Verse 2: AJ]
We've been inside the circus
We took the pleasure with the pain
I guess there's something about us
Whatever comes around we'll always stay the same
Oh yeah!

[Pre-Chorus: All, Brian,  & AJ]
Let's get on with the show

Turn the lights down low

You were there from the start 
We know who you are
We know who you are

[Chorus: All, , Nick & Brian]
Everyone , everyone, everyone
And this one goes out to
Everyone, we're standing strong
Cause of what you've done 
And this one goes out to you

[Bridge: AJ, Brian & All]
Now we're minutes away 'til it's time to play
Our heartbeats are rising, they're letting you in
Time for the show to begin
We, we're standing strong
'Cause of what you've done
This one goes out to you, you, you
You make us feel like we've just begun
And this one goes out to you, yeah

[Chorus: All,  & Brian]
Everyone, everyone, everyone 
Said this one goes out to
Everyone, we're standing strong
'Cause of what you've done 
And this one goes out to you, ooh
Everyone, everyone, everyone 
Said this one goes out to
Everyone, we're standing strong
'Cause of what you've done
[Intro: Brian & All]

Got a question for you, better answer now, yeah

[Pre-Chorus: Nick, Brian, All]

[Chorus: All]

Rock your body, yeah 
Everybody, yeah

Backstreet's back, alright

[Verse 1: Brian]
Who are you now?
Are you still the same
Or did you change somehow?
What do you do
At this very moment when I think of you?
And when I'm looking back
How we were young and stupid
Do you remember that?

[Pre-Chorus 1: Nick]
No matter how I fight it
Can't deny it
Just can't let you go

[Chorus: All]
I still need you
I still care about you
Though everything's been said and done
I still feel you like I'm right beside you
But still no word from you

[Verse 2: AJ and Howie]
Now look at me
Instead of moving on
I refuse to see that I keep coming back
And I'm stuck in a moment
That wasn't meant to last 

[Pre-Chorus 2: Nick]
I've tried to fight it
Can't deny it
You don't even know

[Chorus x1]

[Bridge: Kevin and AJ]
No, no
I wish I could find you just like you found me
Then I would never let you go 

[Outro: All]
Though everything's been said and done 
I still feel you 
Like I'm right beside you 
But still no  word from you

[Verse 1: Brian, Howie & AJ]
It takes a lot to know what is love
It is not the big things, but the little things
That can mean enough
A lot of prayers to get me through
And there is never a day that passes by
I don't think of you
You were always there for me
Pushing me and guiding me
Always to succeed

[Chorus: All, AJ & Brian]
You showed me
When I was young just how to grow
You showed me
Everything that I should know
You showed me
Just how to walk without your hands
Cause mom you always were
The perfect fan

[Verse 2: Kevin, Brian & Howie]
God has been so good
Blessing me with a family
Who did all they could
And I have had many years of grace
And it flatters me when I see a smile on your face
I want to thank you for what you have done
In hopes I can give back to you
And be the perfect son

[Chorus: All & Brian]
You showed me
When I was young just how to grow
You showed me
Everything that I should know
You showed me
Just how to walk without your hands
Cause mom you always were
The perfect fan

[Verse 3: All, AJ & Brian]
You showed me how to love
You showed me how to love
You showed me how to care
You showed me how to care
And you showed me that you would always be there
You would be there
I want to thank you for that time
And I am proud to say you are mine

[Chorus: All & AJ]
You showed me 
When I was young just how to grow
You showed me
Everything that I should know
You showed me
Just how to walk without your hands
Cause mom you always were
The perfect fan

[Outro: Brian, Kevin, AJ & ]
Cause mom you always were
Mom you always were
Mom you always were

Cause mom you always were... the perfect fan
I love you Mom

In love with the money, so no need to mingle 
Just back it up, hot talk, yeah, back it up
Holla at that if you actin' up
You ain't got that, you can't sit with us, yeah
Designer frames make you double take

I just want my money, chips, guap, and queso
Y'all can kiss my ass, dame un beso
Dominicana, drippin in designer
I got the juice, no Tropicana
I got the box that got the most flavor
Big fat cat like in the bodegas
Still making money moves 
Tell me what you think 
Merengue to the money 
Bachata to the bank 
I spice it up, Im like sofrito
I need my money, yo necesito
I told y'all, Im trap Selena
I'll backhand a bitch like Serena
We need the guap, run up in your spot
Put it to your head like, "Give me what you got"
Two bad bitches that came from the Bronx
Cardi from the pole and Jenny from the block 

[Chorus: Jennifer Lopez & DJ Khaled, Both]
Yo quiero, yo quiero dinero, ay
Yo quiero, yo quiero dinero, ay
I just want the green, want the money, want the cash flow

[Intro: Ja Rule & Jennifer Lopez]

What's my motherfuckin' name?!
R-U-L-E
Blowin' back on this Mary Jane, I'm analyzed in the game
And the game done chose me
To bring pain to pussy niggas & pussy hoes
They're one in the same
Ever since you told me
There's only room for two, I've been makin' less room for you
Now only God can hold me
Hug me, love me, judge me
The only man that hovers above me, holla

[Verse 1: Jennifer Lopez]
I met so many men and it's like they're all the same
My appetite for loving is now my hunger pain
And when I'm feeling sexy, who's gonna comfort me?
My only problem is their insecurity

[Pre-Chorus: Ja Rule, Jennifer Lopez, Together]
Tired of being alone, yeah, yeah
Sick of arguing on the phone, yeah, yeah
Are you telling all your friends, yeah, yeah
That your nigga don't understand my love?

[Chorus: Jennifer Lopez, Ja Rule, Together]
'Cause I'm real
The way you walk, the way you move, the way you talk
'Cause I'm real
The way you stare, the way you look, your style, your hair
'Cause I'm real
The way you smile, the way you smell, it drives me wild
'Cause I'm real
And I can't go on without you

[Verse 2: Ja Rule with Jennifer Lopez]
Girl, I've been thinkin' 'bout this relationship
And I wanna know is this as good as it gets?
'Cause we've been through the worst times and the best times
But it was our time, even if it was part-time
Now they been lookin' at me, smilin' at me
Laughin' like we wasn't happy
But not knowin' that we're growin' and we gettin' married
Hard lovin' and straight thuggin'
Bitch, I ain't doin' this shit for nothing
I'm here to get it poppin', hop in', let's ride up in the Benz
Hair blowin' in the wind, sun glistenin' off my skin, hey
I'm nasty, heh, you know me
But you still don't fuck with your baby

[Chorus: Jennifer Lopez, Ja Rule, Together]
'Cause I'm real
The way you walk, the way you move, the way you talk
'Cause I'm real
The way you stare, the way you look, your style, your hair
'Cause I'm real
The way you smile, the way you smell, it drives me wild
'Cause I'm real
And I can't go on without you

[Verse 3: Jennifer Lopez]
Now people lovin' me and hating me, treating me ungratefully
But not knowing that they ain't making or breaking me
My life I live it to the limit and I love it
Now I can breathe again, baby, now I can breathe again
Now people screaming what the deal with you and so and so
I tell them niggas mind their biz, but they don't hear me though
'Cause I live my life to the limit and I love it
Now I could breathe again, baby, now I could breathe again

[Pre-Chorus: Ja Rule, Jennifer Lopez, Together]
Tired of being alone, yeah, yeah
Sick of arguing on the phone, yeah, yeah
Are you telling all your friends, yeah, yeah
That your nigga don't understand my love?

[Chorus: Jennifer Lopez, Ja Rule, Together]
'Cause I'm real
The way you walk, the way you move, the way you talk
'Cause I'm real
The way you stare, the way you look, your style, your hair
'Cause I'm real
The way you smile, the way you smell, it drives me wild
'Cause I'm real
And I can't go on without you
'Cause I'm real
The way you walk, the way you move, the way you talk
'Cause I'm real
The way you stare, the way you look, your style, your hair
'Cause I'm real
The way you smile, the way you smell, it drives me wild
'Cause I'm real
And I can't go on without you

Don't stop, keep it moving, put your drinks up 
Pick your body up and drop it on the floor

And keep on rocking, rock it up on the floor 
If you're a criminal, kill it on the floor
Steal it quick on the floor, on the floor 
Don't stop, keep it moving, put your drinks up 
It's getting ill, it's getting sick on the floor 
We never quit, we never rest on the floor

Seven-trey donkey donk

[Intro: Jennifer Lopez, Sample & LL Cool J]
Love is life and life is living
It's very special
All my love
Oh-oh-oh
Uh, baby, don't go
All my, all my, all my love
Baby, don't go, yeah
Very special
Baby, don't go, uh
All my love
Baby, don't go, yeah
Baby, don't go
All my, all my, all my love
I understand, just chillin'
Baby, don't go, yeah, yeah
Why you actin' like that?

[Verse 1: Jennifer Lopez & LL Cool J]
It's such a shame, but I'm leaving 
Can't take the way you mistreated me 
And it's crazy, but oh, baby 
It don't matter, whatever, don't phase me
I don't believe you wanna leave like this
I don't believe I just had my last real kiss
I do believe we'll laugh and reminisce
Wait a minute, don't bounce, baby, let's talk about this, man

[Pre-Chorus: Jennifer Lopez & LL Cool J]
Well, I'm bouncing and I'm out, son 
I gotta leave you alone 
'Cause I'm good, holding down my spot
And I'm good reppin' the girls on the block 
And I'm good, I got this thing on lock
So without me you'll be fine, right? 

[Chorus: Jennifer Lopez & LL Cool J]
All my pride is all I have
Pride is what you had, baby girl, I'm what you have
You'll be needing me, but too bad
Be easy, don't make decisions when you mad
The path you chose to run alone
I know you're independent, you can make it on your own
Here with me you had a home, oh, yeah
But time is of the essence, why spend it alone? Huh

[Verse 2: Jennifer Lopez & LL Cool J]
The nights I waited up for you 
Promises you made about coming through
So much time you wasted
That's why I had to replace you 
It makes a cat nervous, the thought of settling down
Especially me, I was creepin' all over town 
I thought my tender touch could lock you down 
I knew I had you, as cocky as it sounds
That's the way you used to giggle right before I put it down
It's better when you angry, come here, I'll prove it now 
Stop playing , you gaming
I gotta leave you alone 

[Pre-Chorus: Jennifer Lopez & LL Cool J]
'Cause I'm good holding my spot
Stop acting like that
And I'm good reppin' the girls on the block
Now you know you need to stop
And I'm good, I got this thing on lock
So without me you'll be fine, right?
Here we go

[Chorus: Jennifer Lopez & LL Cool J]
All my pride is all I have
Pride is what you had, baby girl, I'm what you have
You'll be needing me, but too bad
Be easy, don't make decisions when you mad
The path you chose to run alone
I know you're independent, you can make it on your own
Here with me you had a home, oh, yeah
But time is of the essence, why spend it alone? Huh

[Verse 3: LL Cool J & Jennifer Lopez]
People make mistakes to make up, to break up, to wake up
Cold and lonely, chill, baby, you know me, you love me 
I'm like your homie, instead of beefin', come hold me
I promise I'm not a phony, don't bounce, baby, console me 
Ain't nothing you can say to me that
Can change my mind, I got to let you go now 
And nothing will ever be the same, so just 
Be on your way, go ahead and do your thing now 
And there's no more to explain to me, you know 
I know your game and I'm not feeling what you do 
So I'm bouncing and I'm out, son 
I gotta leave you alone, yeah, yeah 

[Chorus: Jennifer Lopez & LL Cool J]
All my pride is all I have 
Pride is what you had, baby girl, I'm what you have
You'll be needing me, but too bad 
Be easy, don't make decisions when you mad 
The path you chose to run alone
I know you're independent, you can make it on your own
Here with me you had a home, oh, yeah
But time is of the essence, why spend it alone? Huh
All my pride is all I have 
Pride is what you had, baby girl, I'm what you have 
You'll be needing me, but too bad 
Be easy, don't make decisions when you mad 
The path you chose to run alone
I know you're independent, you can make it on your own 
Here with me you had a home, oh, yeah 
But time is of the essence, why spend it alone? Huh

[Chorus]
If you had my love, and I gave you all my trust
Would you comfort me?
And if somehow you knew that your love would be untrue
Would you lie to me and call me "baby"?

[Verse 1]
Now, if I give you me, this is how it's got to be
First of all, I won't take you cheatin' on me
Tell me, who can I trust if I can't trust in you?
And I refuse to let you play me for a fool 

[Pre-Chorus]
You said that we could possibly spend eternity

See, that's what you told me, that's what you said
But if you want me, you have to be fulfilling all my dreams

If you really want me, bae

[Chorus]
If you had my love, and I gave you all my trust
Would you comfort me?
Would you comfort me? Tell me, baby
And if somehow you knew that your love would be untrue, yeah 
Would you lie to me and call me "baby"? 

[Verse 2]
You said you want my love and you've got to have it all
But first, there are some things you need to know
If you wanna live with all I have to give
I need to feel true love or it's got to end, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
I don't want you trying to get with me 

And I end up unhappy
I don't need the hurt and I don't need the pain
So before I do give myself to you

I have to know the truth
If I spend my life with you

[Chorus]
If you had my love, and I gave you all my trust 
Would you comfort me? What would you do, babe? Tell me right now
And if somehow you knew that your love would be untrue 
Would you lie to me and call me "baby"? 
If you had my love, and I gave you all my trust 
What would you do? Would you comfort me? 
And if somehow you knew that your love would be untrue 
Would you lie to me and call me "baby"? 

[Bridge]
Mmm, yeah
Ooh, na, na, na
Ooh


[Chorus]
If you had my love, and I gave you all my trust
Would you comfort me? 
And if somehow you knew that your love would be untrue 
Would you lie to me and call me "baby"? 
If you had my love, and I gave you all my trust 
Would you comfort me? 
And if somehow you knew that your love would be untrue 
Would you lie to me and call me "baby"? 

[Outro]
If you had my love, and I gave you all my trust
Would you comfort me?
And if somehow you knew that your love would be untrue
Would you lie to me and call me "baby"?

[Intro]
Oh, yeah

[Verse 1]
Like a movie scene
In the sweetest dreams
I have pictured us together
Now to feel your lips
On my fingertips
I have to say is even better
Than I ever thought it could possibly be
It's perfect, it's passion, it's setting me free
From all of my sadness, the tears that I've cried
I have spent all of my life

[Chorus]
Waiting for tonight, oh
When you would be here in my arms
Waiting for tonight, oh-oh
I've dreamed of this love for so long
Waiting for tonight
Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh

[Verse 2]
Tender words you say
Take my breath away
Love me now and leave me never
Found a sacred place
Lost in your embrace
I want to stay in this forever
I think of the days when the sun used to set
On my empty heart, all alone in my bed
Tossing and turning, emotions were strong
I knew I had to hold on

[Chorus]
Waiting for tonight, oh
When you would be here in my arms
Waiting for tonight, oh-oh
I've dreamed of this love for so long
Waiting for tonight, oh
When you would be here in my arms
Waiting for tonight, oh-oh
I've dreamed of this love for so long
Waiting for tonight
Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh-oh

[Verse 3]
Gone are the days when the sun used to set
On my empty heart all alone in my bed
Tossing and turning, emotions were strong
I knew I had to hold on

[Chorus]
Waiting for tonight, oh
When you would be here in my arms
Waiting for tonight, oh-oh
I've dreamed of this love for so long 
Waiting for tonight, oh 
When you would be here in my arms
Waiting for tonight, oh-oh 
I've dreamed of this love for so long 
Waiting for tonight, oh
When you would be here in my arms
Waiting for tonight, oh-oh 
I've dreamed of this love for so long
Waiting for tonight, oh

Southside Bronx, Teterboro just overseas
Take the pins out her hair, drop to her knees 
Oh my, I'm a don like Omar 
Speed it up slow ma, throw it back, toma 
Rock-rock Gators like my Detroit players
You can hate to love us, you can love to hate us 
From the bottom it been real

And even though we made it to the top
Still JLo from the-the the block

De ti

[Verse 1]
It seemed to be like the perfect thing for you and me
It's so ironic you're what I had pictured you to be
But there are facts in our lives we can never change
Just tell me that you understand and feel the same
This perfect romance that I've created in my mind 
I'd live a thousand lives, each one with you right by my side
But yet we find ourselves in a less-than-perfect circumstance 
And so it seems like we'll never have the chance

[Chorus]
Ain't it funny how some feelings you just can't deny 
And you can't move on even though you try? 
Ain't it strange when youre feeling things you shouldn't feel?
Oh, I wish this could be real
Ain't it funny how a moment could just change your life 
And you don't want to face what's wrong or right? 
Ain't it strange how fate can play a part
In the story of your heart?

[Verse 2]
Sometimes I think that a true love can never be 
I just believe that somehow it wasn't meant for me 
Life can be cruel in a way that I can't explain
And I don't think that I could face it all again
I barely know you but somehow I know what you're about 
A deeper love I've found in you, and I no longer doubt 
You've touched my heart, and it altered every plan I've made
And now I feel that I don't have to be afraid

[Chorus]
Ain't it funny how some feelings you just can't deny 
And you can't move on even though you try? 
Ain't it strange when youre feeling things you shouldn't feel?
Oh, I wish this could be real
Ain't it funny how a moment could just change your life 
And you don't want to face what's wrong or right? 
Ain't it strange how fate can play a part
In the story of your heart?

[Bridge]
I locked away my heart
But you just set it free
Emotions I felt
Held me back from what my life should be 
I pushed you far away
And yet you stayed with me
I guess this means
That you and me were meant to be

[Chorus]
Ain't it funny how some feelings you just can't deny 
And you can't move on even though you try?
Ain't it strange when youre feeling things you shouldn't feel?
Oh, I wish this could be real 
Ain't it funny how a moment could just change your life  
And you don't want to face what's wrong or right? 
Ain't it strange how fate can play a part
In the story of your heart? 
Ain't it funny how some feelings you just can't deny 
And you can't move on even though you try? 
Ain't it strange when youre feeling things you shouldn't feel?
Baby, ain't it funny?
Ain't it funny how a moment could just change your life 
And you don't want to face what's wrong or right? 
Ain't it strange how fate can play a part
Baby, ain't it funny?
Ain't it funny how some feelings you just can't deny 
And you can't move on even though you try? 
Ain't it strange when youre feeling things you shouldn't feel?
Baby
Ain't it funny how a moment could just change your life?
And you don't want to face what's wrong or right?
Ain't it strange how fate can play a part
Ain't it funny how some feelings you just can't deny
And you can't move on even though you try?
Ain't it strange when youre feeling things you shouldn't feel?

And all of that changed since I met you
So we can leave that old shit in the restroom, Young Money!

You got me and I could not defend it
I tried, but I had to surrender
Your style got me under the spellbound
Let me no other choice but to get down

Listen, now I'm strong, baby, I bring the fire on
Sharpshooter, you can call me "The Zion"
I'm not the one easy to get to
But all that changed, baby, when I met you

[Pre-Chorus: Jennifer Lopez & Lil Wayne]
It's too late, it's too late
It's too late, it's too late
It's too late, it's too late
It's too late, come on
You got it, you got it

I'm into you, yeah 
I'm into you 
I'm into you 
I'm into you, yeah

[Verse 4: Lil Wayne]
Okay, now I'm into you, like you never knew
I'm falling for you, baby, I need a parachute
Pussy so wet, I need a wetsuit
You're way too fly, I could be your jet fuel
Now tell me what you like, I like what you tell me
And if you understand me, then you can overwhelm me
It's too late, it's too late
Every finish line is the beginning of a new race, ha!

[Chorus: Jennifer Lopez & Lil Wayne]
When I look into your eyes, it's over 
You got me hooked with your love controller 
I'm tripping and I could not get over
I feel lucky, like a four leaf clover 
I'm into you, I'm into you

It's the Inc. and Lopez now

[Verse 2: Jennifer Lopez]
Ain't that funny?
It's been a while since you came around
Now you want to see what's going down
Tryna tell me why you want my time
Tryna tell me how I'm on your mind 
See, it never had to be this way
You should have never played the games you played
Now I'm seeing that you're kind of lame
Knowing how the situation change

[Chorus: Jennifer Lopez]

Baby, that you want me

Love is crazy
I'm glad I can smile and say
Ain't that funny?

[Verse 3: Jennifer Lopez]
I remember how you walked away
Even when I tried to call your name
See at first I didn't understand
Now you're looking like a lonely man 
I remember how you did me wrong
And now you're hurting 'cause my love is gone
Everybody gets a chance to burn
You can take it as a lesson learned

[Chorus: Jennifer Lopez]
Ain't that funny? 
Baby, that you want me
When you had me
Love is crazy

Ain't that funny?

And Murda I.N.C

[Verse 5: Jennifer Lopez]
I really wish you wouldn't send me gifts
Tryna make me sit and reminisce
Tryna blind me with your blinging bling
Thought I told you love don't cost a thing 
Hope you realize that now I'm through
And I don't ever want to hear from you
I had enough of being there for you
Now I'm laughing why you play the fool

[Chorus: Jennifer Lopez]
Ain't that funny? 
Baby, that you want me
When you had me

In order to win at a war I had already won
Yeah, I'd given up on the saying "I'll never give up"
But look at me now
Yeah, look at me, I'm limitless 
Look at me now
Yeah, look at me, I'm limitless 
Yeah, look at me now
Yeah, look at me, I'm limitless

So give me what I'm asking for

No no no no no no

Look at me now
Yeah, look at me, I'm limitless

So many ways, wanna touch you tonight
I'm a big girl, got no secrets this time
Yeah, I love to make love to you, baby

[Verse 4: Pitbull]
Mr Worldwide, and the world's most beautiful woman
Modern day hugh hef' 
Playboy to the death 
Is he really worldwide? 
Mami let me open your treasure chest
Play dates, we play mates
I'm the king snatching queens, checkmate
What you think?
It's a rumor
I'm really out of this world
Moon, luna
Make women comfortable
Call me bloomer
Can't even show love cause they'll sue ya
But I told them, 'hallelujah, have a blessed day'
So ahead of myself
Everyday's yesterday
Want the recipe? it's real simple
Little bit of voli, and she'll open sesame

[Interlude: Pitbull]
Now dance, yes

[Chorus]
Think you gotta keep me iced, you don't
Think I'm gonna spend your cash, I won't
Even if you were broke
My love don't cost a thing
Think I wanna drive your Benz, I don't
If I wanna floss, I got my own
Even if you were broke
My love don't cost a thing

[Verse 1]
When you rolled up in the Escalade
Saw that truck you gave to the valet
Knew that it was game when you looked at me
Pulling up your sleeve so I could see the Rollie bling
Saw you later in the corner booth
Raising up a toast, so I would notice you
But your heart's a mess, think you oughta know
Doesn't matter if you're balling out of control

[Pre-Chorus]
All that matters is
That you treat me right
Give me all the things I need
That money can't buy, yeah

[Chorus]
Think you gotta keep me iced, you don't
Think I'm gonna spend your cash, I won't
Even if you were broke
My love don't cost a thing
Think I wanna drive your Benz, I don't 
If I wanna floss, I got my own
Even if you were broke
My love don't cost a thing

[Verse 2]
When I took a chance thought you'd understand 
Baby, credit cards aren't romance
So you're trying to buy what's already yours
What I need from you is not available in stores
Seen a side of you  that I really feel 
Doing way too much , never keep it real 
If it doesn't change, gotta hit the road
Now I'm leaving, where's my keys? I've got to go

[Pre-Chorus]
All that matters is
That you treat me right
Give me all the things I need
That money can't buy, yeah

[Chorus]
Think you gotta keep me iced, you don't
Think I'm gonna spend your cash, I won't 
Even if you were broke
My love don't cost a thing 
Think I wanna drive your Benz, I don't 
If I wanna floss, I got my own
Even if you were broke
My love don't cost a thing

[Bridge]
Love don't cost a thing, a thing, a thing
Yeah, yeah, yeah
You think the money that you make 
Can substitute the time you take 
Take the keys here to my heart
Then you can win my heart, and get what's in my heart 
I think you need to take some time
To show me that your love is true 
There's more than dollar signs in you
Then you can win my heart, and get what's in my heart

[Chorus]
Think you gotta keep me iced, you don't
Think I'm gonna spend your cash, I won't
Even if you were broke
My love don't cost a thing 
Think I wanna drive your Benz, I don't
If I wanna floss, I got my own
Even if you were broke 
My love don't cost a thing 
Think you gotta keep me iced, you don't
Think I'm gonna spend your cash, I won't
Even if you were broke
My love don't cost a thing
Think I wanna drive your Benz, I don't 
If I wanna floss, I got my own 
Even if you were broke
My love don't cost a thing
Think you gotta keep me iced, you don't 
Think I'm gonna spend your cash, I won't 
Even if you were broke
My love don't cost a thing
Think I wanna drive your Benz, I don't 
If I wanna floss, I got my own 
Even if you were broke
My love don't cost a thing

Los poderes

[Verso: Jennifer Lopez, Wisin]
Dos cuerpos entregados
Un par de enamorados
Flechados, cansados
Sudor desenfrenado
Cuando t y yo nos juntamos
Sin piedad 
Nos damos

[Coro: Jennifer Lopez]
Cuando hacemos el amor
Amor, amor, amor
Vuelvo a la vida, siento que vuelo

Cuando hacemos el amor
Amor, amor, amor
Vuelvo a la vida cuando toco tu cuerpo

[Verso 2: Wisin]
La la la eh, el sudor en tu piel
A m me vuelves loco
Tus besos saben a miel
Ahora, eh!
Quiero tu desnudez
A m si t te vuelves lo hacemos otra vez

Cuando se pone el babydoll Uf, arrasa!
Una copa de vino y tumba la casa
No s qu me pasa
Pero cuando me abrasa
Con su fuego me traspasa
Y en el medio de la cama se entrega
Siempre pa' alante
Sabe como se breva
Y se pega, se pega

[Coro: Jennifer Lopez]
Cuando hacemos el amor
Amor, amor, amor
Vuelvo a la vida, siento que vuelo

Cuando hacemos el amor
Amor, amor, amor
Vuelvo a la vida cuando toco tu cuerpo

[Verso 3: Jennifer Lopez]
Amor toda la noche
Baados en sudor
Tenemos la fortuna
De perder el control

Se oculta la luna
Cuando sale el sol
Se pierde mi blusa
Y tu pantaln

Suma la cama
Resta la ropa
Bsame rico
Vulveme loca
As, as, as
As, as, as

Sabes a cielo
Hueles a gloria
Dame la vida y la victoria
As, as, as
As

Yo quiero hacrtelo lento
Tu cuerpo
Fluyendo as como el viento
Sin mezclar los sentimientos

[Wisin]
Bien lento, muy lento 
Para aprovechar el tiempo, contigo beb 

[Coro: Jennifer Lopez]
Cuando hacemos el amor
Amor, amor, amor
Vuelvo a la vida, siento que vuelo

Cuando hacemos el amor
Amor, amor, amor
Vuelvo a la vida cuando toco tu cuerpo

I know it's a long shot
But we're bringing it all back
We're bringing it all back

So let's bring it back to life
Now we have another chance to fly
Another chance to make it right

Feel the light
Shining like the stars tonight
Remember what we forgot
I know it's a long shot
But we're bringing it all back
We're bringing it all back

Yeah, woo, yeah
Oh, oh, oh, oh

[Verse 1]
You're looking just a little too hard at me
Standing just a little too close to me
You're saying not quite enough to me
You're sipping just a little too slow for me
No doubt you play it real cool, homie
Got me thinking what is it you do for me?
Tripping  a little more than I should be
So let yourself go and get right with me

[Chorus]
I'm about to sign you up, we can get right
Before the night is up, we can get right, we can get right

I'm about to fill your cup, so we can get right
Before the night is up, we can get right, tonight


[Post-Chorus]
Yeah, huh
Yeah, huh
Yeah, huh

[Verse 2]
Your lips talking 'bout I, "Play too much"
Can't a woman take advantage of what she wants?
My hips moving, oh, so slow 
Bar tab looking like a car note 
All I need is you here right by my side 
Take whatever you want, baby, let's ride 
And whatever you won't do, let me decide
Just put your name on the dotted line

[Chorus]
I'm about to sign you up, we can get right
Before the night is up, we can get right, we can get right 

I'm about to fill your cup, so we can get right
Before the night is up, we can get right, tonight


[Bridge]
So much we've got to say, but so little time
And if tonight ain't long enough, don't leave love behind

Baby, take my hand, I'll show you why

[Chorus]
I'm about to sign you up, we can get right
Before the night is up, we can get right, we can get right

[Pre-Chorus: Jennifer Lopez]
Don't let the tables turn
Don't let the bridges burn
Been down for you, don't get it confused
Boy, you could lose your turn
Don't let the tables turn
Don't let the bridges burn
'Cause everything could change in a matter of days
Depending if you've learned

[Chorus: Jennifer Lopez]

Why you acting like that? 
You gon' miss me when I'm gone
Why you acting like that?


Why you acting like that? 
You gon' miss me when I'm gone
Why you acting like that?
When I leave I'm taking off

[Verse 2: Jennifer Lopez]
Baddest bitch in the world right here
You ain't even gotta go nowhere
Boy, you better watch the way you walk
'Cause if you trip you're gonna fall, oh

[Pre-Chorus: Jennifer Lopez]
Don't let the tables turn
Don't let the bridges burn
Been down for you, don't get it confused
Boy, you could lose your turn
Don't let the tables turn
Don't let the bridges burn
'Cause everything could change in a matter of days
Depending if you've learned

[Chorus: Jennifer Lopez & Iggy Azalea]

Why you acting like that? 
You gon' miss me when I'm gone
Why you acting like that?


Why you acting like that? 
You gon' miss me when I'm gone
Why you acting like that? 
When I leave I'm taking off

[Verse 3: Iggy Azalea]
Oh, well shit, she ain't me 
My love cost too, baby, ain't nothing free 
Check my angle, daddy, you could call me angel, daddy 
But you gon' turn your beauty right into a beast 
Now, this is the business or pleasure, let's keep 'em separate 
I ain't tryna be second, just for the record 
I see you slippin' you trippin', thought I should let you know
I admire your effort but I need better love
See many men try to play me 'til they get scared away 
I told 'em that's a fall, try out another day 
This is different, now I'm seeing that it isn't 
Promise I'm not gon' cry here like Mary J
Now ain't that funny, that you was something special 'til
I noticed that you just like these losers who come in severals
But I, know that if you leave you comin' right back
So my question boy is, why you acting like that?

[Pre-Chorus: Jennifer Lopez]
Don't let the tables turn
Don't let the bridges burn
Been down for you, don't get it confused
Boy, you could lose your turn
Don't let the tables turn
Don't let the bridges burn
'Cause everything could change in a matter of days
Depending if you've learned

[Chorus: Jennifer Lopez]

Why you acting like that? 
You gon' miss me when I'm gone
Why you acting like that?


Why you acting like that? 
You gon' miss me when I'm gone
Why you acting like that?
When I leave I'm taking off

[Intro]
Uh, what?
Uh, uh, uh
Let's go

[Verse 1]
Called you on the phone, said I'm coming through
Hope you're all alone, 'cause I got plans for you
We could stay at home or dance and hang all night
As long as I'm with you, doesn't matter what we do

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't ask me where I've been
Or what I'm gonna do, just know that I'm here with you
Don't try to understand

[Interlude]
Woo! Oh, come on
Huh!
In the pocket, yeah

Tell them I'm the one that made you give a damn

We can first give you some of this, that's you
And you're all out loving that JLove, true

[Verse 1: Jennifer Lopez]
Hold up, I can get you fun up
Pull your trigger, go and get your gun up
I'ma tie my hair up top
Put a pin in it, now I'm ready, let it rock
Keep it number one, that's easy mathematics
Keep it number one, baby, ain't no static
Got that hourglass for you, baby, look at these legs
No brakes, go green, no red
If you wanna kill the body, gotta start with the head
Put it on you, I'ma need about 4-5 beds
'Cause I love my papi

[Pre-Chorus: Jennifer Lopez]
I didn't see it, but I see it now
Think I love you, and I need you now

All day, 24 hour
Feeling like I want one when it's crowded
If you wanna hear your name, I shout it
Boy, you the shit, go and take a power shower
And I'm feeling like it's me and you, I don't doubt it
You can drive it how you want, I ain't tryna count mileage

Started from the bottom, baby, then we went roof
'Cause I love my papi

[Verse 3: Big Sean]
Do you love me? Do you swear?
Am I still the one? Even when I'm not there 
'Cause you know how it go and go
When you wanna go and go
Have you seen what's her face? 
Is her number in your phone?
And your answer's yes and yes
But you still say no and no
Even though I know you know
I know I know you know I know
You know? It sound dumb-de-dumb-dumb
They say what we want's wrong, fuck it
Least know what we want
And it sucks to see you cry
Know a brokenhearted girl could make the whole world drown 
And even though your makeup smears
Man I'm the one that's been the clown, why the fuck we around?
'Cause girl, you know I got that jaw drop shit 
Plus I know your insecurities, that mall cop shit 
I give you that screwface shit 
Bring the ugly side out, two-faced shit 
Tryin' all new ways shit 
One night turn into a few days shit 

[Verse 4: Jennifer Lopez & Big Sean]
I think I love just who you are 
We haven't grown apart, this is just the start
Where life begin, all the way to the end 
And we started as friends, boy, I do love

[Intro: Jennifer Lopez & ]
Oh yes


[Verse 1: Nas]
Yo, I took you from the projects, put the best clothes in ya closet
Like Ginger from "Casino" and now you a pro
We was like Joe DiMaggio and Marilyn Monroe
All ya jealous girlfriends hatin' waitin'
So I put the cards in yo' hand
All I know, when Nas was yo' man
It was so real, boats and sixes
Special Japanese chefs makin' home cooked dishes
Plenty trips, invisible sets
You know what you missin'

[Verse 2: Jennifer Lopez]
It's funny 'cause for a while
I walked around with a smile
But deep inside, I could hear
Voices telling me this ain't right
Don't you know he's not for you?
I always knew what I had to do
But it's hard to get away
'Cause I love you, I just tried to stay

[Chorus: Jennifer Lopez]
I used to say I couldn't do it but I did it 
After telling everybody that I wasn't with it 
Though it brings tears to my eyes, I can feel it
And I know inside I'ma be alright 
I said I couldn't do it but I did it 
After telling everybody that I wasn't with it 
Though it brings tears to my eyes, I can feel it
And that voice inside says I'm gonna be alright

[Verse 3: Jennifer Lopez]
Friends of mine say to me
Say you got control over me
You're not alone, I played my part
I saw the way you were from the start
Could I expect so much from you?
You had a girl when I first met you
Did the best that you could do
Now I realize that I can't change you

[Chorus: Jennifer Lopez]
I used to say I couldn't do it but I did it 
After telling everybody that I wasn't with it
Though it brings tears to my eyes, I can feel it
And I know inside I'ma be alright 
I said I couldn't do it but I did it 
After telling everybody that I wasn't with it 
Though it brings tears to my eyes, I can feel it
And that voice inside says I'm gonna be alright

[Bridge: Jennifer Lopez & Nas]
Said I wouldn't walk away
Some days I want to stay 
But leaving you is what I need to do 
To be okay 
I never thought it would be true 
Be living without you 
So now it's time for me to make that move 

[Verse 4: Nas & ]
Yo, nobody understands me, I'm dealin' with pressure
My peoples is locked in a jail cell with no bail stressin'
Guess it's the life of a kingpin 
Rap Stephen King, rap bling
Like neon lights, we gon' be alright 
But it's like, you feelin' me lesser
Claim I'm actin' like a retard, right? 
Me and my boys, we start fights, when will I mature?
You scream I'm in the streets all night
Or where was I at, ya found light brown hairs on my hat 
I'm slow caught

[Chorus: Jennifer Lopez]
I used to say I couldn't do it but I did it
After telling everybody that I wasn't with it
Though it brings tears to my eyes, I can feel it
And I know inside I'ma be alright
I said I couldn't do it but I did it
After telling everybody that I wasn't with it
Though it brings tears to my eyes, I can feel it
And that voice inside says I'm gonna be alrightLetra de "El Anillo " ft Ozuna

[Intro: Ozuna]
T me preguntas que el anillo pa' cundo
Pero soy yo el que por ti 'toy esperando
Dale ah, mami, pa' m modelando
Muchos deseos, pero soy yo quien mando

[Verso 1: Jennifer Lopez]
Me tratas como una princesa y me das lo que pido
T tienes el bate y la fuerza que yo necesito
Cuando estamos solos, te juro, no me falta nada
Te pongo un trece de diez cuando estamo'en la cama

[Pre-Coro: Jennifer Lopez]
Nunca haba sentido algo tan grande
Y me vuelve loca tu lado salvaje
T me has dado tanto que he estado pensando
Ya lo tengo todo, pero...

[Coro: Jennifer Lopez & Oscarcito]
Y el anillo pa' cuando? 
Y el anillo pa' cuando? 
Y el anillo pa' cuando? 
Y el anillo pa' cuando? 

[Verso 2: Ozuna]
Me gusta to'o lo que traes
El anillo est ready pero quiero hablarte en la raya
Lo hacemos y nos comprometemos
Te gusta mi juego? Yo traje unos truquitos 'e magia
El anillo ya no te cae
Pero si tu quieres hacemos una boda en Dubai
Contigo ningn strike
Le doy pa' los 500 y me dice que reglas no hay
Lo hacemos, lo hacemos, lo hacemos
Miramos al espejo y ms ganas me caen
Como yo no hay, que termine en el primero
El segundo vamos para el G5
Dominican, puertorriqueo, t sabes, la raza no cae, no cae
T eres ma, mai

[Pre-Coro: Jennifer Lopez]
Nunca haba sentido algo tan grande
Y me vuelve loca tu lado salvaje
T me has dado tanto que he estado pensando

Perro que muerde no anda por ah ladrando, oh
Tengo de sobra en una fila esperando, oh
A ti el tiempo se te est acabando

[Intro: Lin-Manuel Miranda]
And love is love, is love, is love is love
Is love, is love, is love, is love

[Verse 1: Jennifer Lopez]
I'm...I'm wide awake
Ready to create
Everything I've imagined
Hearts, without any hate
Crying for change
Causing a chain reaction

[Pre-Chorus: Jennifer Lopez]
Those who hate us and fear us, can not keep us down
Cause we hear in our heartbeat a beautiful sound
If they try to deny us or silence us now
We just say no, oh, yeah, we let 'em know

[Chorus: Jennifer Lopez]
Love make the world go round
La-la-la-la-la-la-la
Love make the world go round
La-la-la-la-la-la-la
Love make the world go round-ound-ound-ound
Love make the world go round
La-la-la-la-la-la-la

[Verse 2: Jennifer Lopez]
We...we'll be alright
Living our lives
Finding some satisfaction
No, we're not gonna hide
No fear from our eyes
Love is a call to action

[Pre-Chorus: Jennifer Lopez]
Those who hate us and fear us, can not keep us down
Cause we hear in our heartbeat a beautiful sound
If they try to deny us or silence us now
We just say no, oh, yeah, we let 'em know

[Chorus: Jennifer Lopez]
Love make the world go round
La-la-la-la-la-la-la
Love make the world go round
La-la-la-la-la-la-la
Love make the world go round-ound-ound-ound
Love make the world go round
La-la-la-la-la-la-la


[Verse 3: Lin-Manuel Miranda ]
Yeah, when the music is playing and the place is jumping
When the bass rattles your ribcage, hey something's changed
I'm dancing face to face with a stranger
A moment of grace, you know that you're safe, and they just
Drop the beat the moment you most needed it
You came in as a question until the music completed it
Me and you in the universe, moving in unison, coming in hot
But in the grand scheme what do we got?
What we got is love even when the sinners hate us
We can not let 'em diminish or intimidate us
We sing out, we got the rhythm and the truth on our side
We cut through the divide and we do it with pride

A generation of innovators unable to patiently wait for change
Cause change is what they've been afraid of
Their malevolence can wait, raise the level of debate
Celebrate, elevate, love, love


[Interlude: Lin-Manuel Miranda ]
Cannot be killed or swept aside

And fill the world with music, love and pride
(Love make the world go round
Love make the world go round)
And love is love, is love, is love is love
Is love, is love, is love, is love


[Chorus: Jennifer Lopez]
Love make the world go round
La-la-la-la-la-la-la
Love make the world go round
La-la-la-la-la-la-la
Love make the world go round-ound-ound-ound
Love make the world go round
La-la-la-la-la-la-la
Love make the world go round

[Outro]
We're not staying inside today
They're not taking our pride away
Le-lo-lai-la-lo-lai-lo-le
We're not staying inside today
They're not taking our pride away
Le-lo-lai-la-lo-lai-lo-le
La-la-la-la-la-la-la
Love make the world go round

[Intro: Big Punisher & Jennifer Lopez]
Tired and relieved because he alone?
We haven't got Artist of the Year , Rhyme of the Year 
Grammy nominations , 'cause we're fat or blind or nutting, baby 
Aight? All night 
Playing this out my way 
All night long, all night 
Yo, yo, yo, yo, yo 

[Verse 1: Big Punisher, Jennifer Lopez & ]
You priceless
You like diamonds, I'll ice your wrist 
He got chedda, I'm twice as rich 
Make you bite your lips
Jenny, dju know that dju likin' this 
I used to think you ever leave me, I'd slice my wrist
Treat you like a bitch, never that 
You got beef, where my niggas at? 
And the street's where I'm living at

[Verse 2: Fat Joe & Jennifer Lopez]
Clitter clack, that's the sound of the Mini Mack
Where we at? Uptown where it's really at
Give me that, I want the mansion and yacht 
Advance on the spot, we can dance 'til we drop
Am I handsome or not? 
Jenny, you the bomb
Any man disrespect, good as gone

[Verse 3: Jennifer Lopez]
When I opened up my eyes today
Felt the sun shining on my face
It became so clear to me that everything is going my way
I feel like there's no limit to what I can see
Got rid of fears that were holding me
My endless possibility has the whole world opened for me
That's why...

[Chorus: Jennifer Lopez]
I'm feeling so good 
I knew that I would 
Been taking care of myself like I should 
'Cause I don't think anyone can bring me down 
Nothing in this world's gon' turn me around

[Verse 4: Jennifer Lopez]
Now the day is turning into night
And everything is still going right
There's no way you can stop me this time
Or break this spirit of mine, oh, no
Like the stars above, I'm gonna shine
Anything I want will be mine
Tonight, I'm gonna have a good time
Call a few friends of mine
'Cause I'm loving life, and tonight's for feeling

[Chorus: Jennifer Lopez]
I'm feeling so good 
I knew that I would 
Been taking care of myself like I should 
'Cause I don't think anyone can bring me down 
Nothing in this world's gon' turn me around
I'm feeling so good 
I knew that I would 
Been taking care of myself like I should 
'Cause I don't think anyone can bring me down 
Nothing in this world's gon' turn me around 

[Verse 5: Big Punisher & Fat Joe]
Boricua, that's you mamacita
Puerto Rican diva from La Isla Bonita
Let me freak ya on the dance floor
Lead your mans off, he just tryna get your pants off
That's the last straw, Pun, I ain't got a glass jaw
Better run when you see me coming through the back door
Crack's raw, I give it all for my brother
Two things I don't share, that's my money and my lover
I know money's just for caring, that's for real
Take's cash to live 
You love her? Better scrap, for real
Shut up your grill
You know we never fight
It's your world, girl, set it off right

[Chorus: Jennifer Lopez]
I'm feeling so good 
I knew that I would 
Been taking care of myself like I should 
'Cause I don't think anyone can bring me down 
Nothing in this world's gon' turn me around 
I'm feeling so good 
I knew that I would 
Been taking care of myself like I should 
'Cause I don't think anyone can bring me down 
Nothing in this world's gon' turn me around
I'm feeling so...

[Bridge: Jennifer Lopez & Big Punisher]
Party on tonight 
Everything is feeling right

Always comes out of a little bit something bad
And I wasn't looking for someone new 'til you came down
Giving me the best that I've had

And now you're on my skin
Body-to-body, working me out 
Yeah you, you play to win
Rocking me steady, round after round

So good, knowing I could just keep it real, t-shirt and jeans
See you making me feel so fly

And now you're on my skin
Body-to-body, working me out 
Yeah you, you play to win
Rocking me steady, round after round

This is not the girl you used to know

Standin' in the hood but, you look like you came off the page of a book
Pretty face and your ass off the hook 
In the rain, like a crab when I look 
Whew, you are such a distraction
You act like you want it, I give you the business 
Tear that shit up, girl, as God as my witness 
Would you bend if you don't know me? 
Honey, I'm considered your OG
Bitch don't like life cause you don't want me
Think you could do better? Well we sure gon' see 
Hold up, back in '04, try, you don't know me 
The moral of the story, you, you don't know me 
Got there right now, I'm the man right now
Anybody get it, we can get it in right now 
Listen one thing still in the pen right now 
Kill your gun, take your cell, I'd be dead by now 
But stare right now, get bread like wow 
When the drop hit, now get head like oww 
We let that A.K. go by JLo, don't get it twisted
You don't know me now, oh, you don't know me now

The day that we first met 
Wasn't looking for what I found
But I found you and I'm bound to
Find happiness in being around you

[Chorus]
I'm glad when I'm making love to you
I'm glad for the way you make me feel

[Intro: Jennifer Lopez & R. Kelly]
Baby, I love you 
You know I need you
Gotta have you 
Can't be without you 

[Verse 1: R. Kelly]
It's like downtown New York in the middle of traffic jams
All I really want you to know is who I am
You can find me low-key in the back of the club
Or with some fine females, rollin' on dubs
You and me big pimpin' on a shopping spree in L.A
Paparazzi's and critics, who give a damn what they say?

[Verse 2: Jennifer Lopez & R. Kelly]
Boy, I never knew I could feel the way I felt when I met you
I could never forget you
And boy, when you look my way 
I realize more and more I adore your pretty eyes

[Pre-Chorus: Jennifer Lopez]
But what I wanna know from you is do you wanna share my love's bliss?
I long for the day when I'm feeling your kiss 
Can you love me for a lifetime for just in one night?
I'm helpless for you, baby, but it's alright 

[Chorus: Jennifer Lopez]
Baby, I love you 
Baby, I need you 
I gotta have you 
Can't be without you 
Baby, I love you 
Baby, I need you 
I gotta have you 
Can't be without you

[Interlude: Jennifer Lopez & R. Kelly]
Papi, I got something to say to you 

[Verse 3: Jennifer Lopez & R. Kelly]
Blessed and cursed on the day that I felt the power of you  
Inside me, it was strong and I loved it 
And there comes a time in our lives when things change 
And baby, I'll spend it with you

[Pre-Chorus: Jennifer Lopez & R. Kelly]
What I wanna know from you is do you wanna share my love's bliss?
I long for the day when I'm feeling your kiss 
Can you love me for a lifetime but just in one night
I'm helpless for you, baby, but it's alright  

[Chorus: Jennifer Lopez & R. Kelly]
Oh, baby, I love you 
Baby, I need you 
I gotta have you 
Can't be without you 
Baby, I love you 
Baby, I need you 
I gotta have you 
Can't be without you

[Bridge: Jennifer Lopez & R. Kelly]
Baby I love you 
You know I need you 
Gotta have you 
Can't be without you 

[Verse 3: R. Kelly]
It's like downtown New York in the middle of traffic jams
All I really want you to know is who I am
You can find me low-key in the back of the club
Or with some fine females, rollin' on dubs
You and me big pimpin' on a shopping spree in L.A
Paparazzi's and critics, who give a damn what they say?
In the rear, drop-top Bentley on somebody's highway
Who let it jumpin' in some club on this valet?
Got a little smoke, got a little drinks sittin' in V.I.P
Got a little buzz with my hands up, honeys feeling me
Got that Cris' sittin' on ice like a gansta lean
Hands surrounding them like dice like security
After party in the Ritz Carlton, penthouse suite
All my thugs and me, breath smelling like Hennessey
Got a few friends flying in from San Diego
It's a surprise party for my homie J.Lo

[Chorus: Jennifer Lopez]
I need you 
I gotta have you, baby 
Baby, I love you 
Ooh, oh, I swear I do 
This a big love, babe 

[Outro: Jennifer Lopez]
Ooh 
Ladies 
Do you know what I'm talking about? 
Oh, woah, when a man gets inside your soul 
And it takes hold, and it won't let go 

Hey, hey

Hey, hey, hey

[Verse 1]
Ayer los dos sobamos con un mundo perfecto
Ayer a nuestros labios les sobraban las palabras
Porque en los ojos nos espibamos el alma
Y la verdad no vacilaba en tu mirada
Ayer nos prometimos conquistar el mundo entero
Ayer t me juraste que este amor seria eterno
Por que una vez equivocarse es suficiente
Para aprender lo que es amar sinceramente

[Chorus]
Qu Hiciste? Nos obligaste a destruir las madrugadas
Y nuestras noches las ahogaron tus palabras
Mis ilusiones acabaron con tus falsas
Se te olvido que era el amor lo que importaba
Y con tus manos derrumbaste nuestra casa

[Verse 2]
Maana que amanezca un da nuevo en mi universo
Maana no ver tu nombre escrito entre mis versos
No escuchare palabras de arrepentimiento
Ignorare sin pena tu remordimiento
Maana olvidare que ayer yo fui tu fiel amante
Maana ni siquiera habr razones para odiarte
Yo borrare todos tus sueos de mis sueos
Que el viento arrastre para siempre tus recuerdos

[Pre-Chorus]
Qu Hiciste? Hoy destruiste con tu orgullo la esperanza
Hoy empaaste con tu furia mi mirada
Borraste toda nuestra historia con tu rabia
Y confundiste tanto amor que te entregaba
Como permiso para as romperme el alma

[Chorus]
Qu Hiciste? Nos obligaste a destruir las madrugadas
Y nuestras noches las ahogaron tus palabras
Mis ilusiones acabaron con tus falsas
Se te olvido que era el amor lo que importaba
Y con tus manos derrumbaste nuestra casa

[Bridge]
Y confundiste tanto amor que te entregaba
Como permiso para as romperme el alma

[Chorus]
Qu Hiciste? Nos obligaste a destruir las madrugadas
Y nuestras noches las borraron tus palabras
Mis ilusiones acabaron con tus falsas
Se te olvido que era el amor lo que importaba
Y con tus manos derrumbaste nuestra casa

[Chorus]
I was busy thinkin' 'bout boys, boys, boys
Always busy dreamin' 'bout boys, boys, boys 
Head is spinnin' thinkin' 'bout boys

[Verse 1]
I need that bad boy to do me right on a Friday
And I need that good one to wake me up on a Sunday
That one from work can come over on Monday night
I want 'em all, I want 'em all
And when they finally leave me, I'm all alone but
I'm lookin' down and my girls are blowin' my phone up
Them twenty questions, they askin' me where I'm at
Didn't hit 'em back

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm sorry that I missed your party
I wish I had a better excuse like
I had to trash the hotel lobby

[Chorus]
But I was busy thinkin' 'bout boys, boys, boys
I was busy dreamin' 'bout boys, boys, boys
Head is spinnin' thinkin' 'bout boys

[Verse 2]
In every city I've got one with different ringtones
Flyin' from L.A. all the way to Puerto Rico
My girls are callin' me askin' me where I'm at
Didn't hit 'em back

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm sorry that I missed your party
I wish I had a better excuse
Like I can't even lie you got me

[Chorus]
I was busy thinkin' 'bout boys, boys, boys
I was busy dreamin' 'bout boys, boys, boys
Head is spinnin' thinkin' 'bout boys

[Bridge]
Don't be mad, don't be mad at me 
Darling, I can't stop it even if I wanted
Don't be mad, don't be mad at me 
Missed what you were sayin', I was miles away, yeah
Don't be mad, don't be mad
Not like I had a choice
I was busy thinkin' 'bout boys, boys, boys
I was busy dreamin' 'bout boys, boys, boys

[Chorus]
I was busy thinkin' 'bout boys, boys, boys
I was busy dreamin' 'bout boys, boys, boys
Head is spinnin' thinkin' 'bout boys

[Verse 1]
You're picture-perfect blue
Sunbathing under the moon
Stars shining as your bones illuminate
First kiss just like a drug
Under your influence
You take me over, you're the magic in my veins
This must be love

[Chorus]
Boom clap, the sound of my heart
The beat goes on and on and on and on and
Boom clap, you make me feel good
Come on to me, come on to me now
Boom clap, the sound of my heart
The beat goes on and on and on and on and
Boom clap, you make me feel good
Come on to me, come on to me now

[Verse 2]
No silver or no gold
Could dress me up so good
You're the glitter in the darkness of my world
Just tell me what to do
I'll fall right into you
We're going under cast the spell, just say the word
I feel your love!

[Chorus]
Boom clap, the sound of my heart
The beat goes on and on and on and on and
Boom clap, you make me feel good
Come on to me, come on to me now
Boom clap, the sound of my heart
The beat goes on and on and on and on and
Boom clap, you make me feel good
Come on to me, come on to me now

[Bridge]
You are the light and I will follow
You let me lose my shadow
You are the sun, the glowing halo
And you keep burning me up with all your love, oh

[Chorus]
Boom clap, the sound of my heart
The beat goes on and on and on and on and
Boom clap, you make me feel good
Come on to me, come on to me now
Boom clap, the sound of my heart
The beat goes on and on and on and on and
Boom clap, you make me feel good
Come on to me, come on to me now
Boom clap, the sound of my heart
The beat goes on and on and on and on and
Boom clap, you make me feel good
Come on to me, come on to me now
Boom clap, the sound of my heart
The beat goes on and on and on and on and
Boom clap, you make me feel good
Come on to me, come on to me now

All my friends are princesses, we keep it whipped and creamy
Ice cubes on our tongues, because we like to keep it freezy

All my life, I've been waitin' for a good time, a good time

Have you heard her? Have you seen her?)

[Verse 3: CupcakKe]
Got a couple of bitches that want my attention
They actin' real vicious, but I'm not offended
They lurkin' like witnesses, money I'm gettin'
Could drop an ice tray and I still won't be slippin'
 Another check comin' in
 A couple checks I ain't spend
 Fat pockets, need a gym
 Made it possible like Kim
Today, I got great times
Square it out like FaceTime
Yellow tape around the body
But not measurin' waistlines 
Zero fucks, the amount 
Zero bucks in your account 
So many offers on the table 
A bitch gotta eat on the couch

[Chorus: Charli XCX & Pabllo Vittar]
I got it, I got it, I got it, I got it, I got it, I got it

I won't show it, never, never, but it's crystal 
I'm way up, way better
She might pop, but it's whatever
She might sell, but what's she selling?
Does she last long?
I know they write about me 
I know that they all see me 
Too scared so they don't play me
Some people tried to save me

[Bridge: Charli XCX & Troye Sivan, Charli XCX]
Ooh, but I'm feeling so good
Better than I ever could
Had bad people in my business, gone now
Cage, prison, now it's gone away
They wanna listen what I say
Think I care about the fame?

[Intro: Charli XCX & Lizzo]
Hey, listen 
I blame it on you, I blame it on you
Yee!

[Verse 1: Charli XCX]
I just wanna drink you up
Pour you in a silver cup
You know I like to party
But you know I love your body
So many things I shouldn't do
I hate myself for hurting you 
Honestly, I'm reckless
I'm sorry if I'm selfish

[Pre-Chorus: Charli XCX]
Every time you get too close, I run, I run away
And every time you say the words, I don't know what to say
Back, back to the beginning, really wish that I could change
I do, I do, I do

[Chorus: Charli XCX]
I blame it on your love
Every time I fuck it up
I blame it on your love, I do
I blame it on your love
I can't help it, I can't stop
I blame it on your love, I do

[Post-Chorus: Charli XCX]
Blame it on your love
Woah-oh, I blame it on your love

[Verse 2: Charli XCX]
Sorry I'm a little scared
But no one ever really cared 
I took you for granted 
Just a big misunderstanding
I just want to spend the night 
Sleeping in your bed tonight 
Or watch a little TV
I love it when you need me

[Pre-Chorus: Charli XCX]
Every time you get too close, I run, I run away 
And every time you say the words, I don't know what to say 
Back, back to the beginning, really wish that I could change
I do, I do, I do

[Chorus: Charli XCX]
I blame it on your love 
Every time I fuck it up 
I blame it on your love, I do
I blame it on your love
I can't help it, I can't stop
I blame it on your love, I do

[Post-Chorus: Charli XCX & Lizzo]
Blame it on your love
Blame it on your love 
I don't know what's wrong with this girl Charli, she crazy 

[Bridge: Lizzo]
Gotta blame it on the, blame it on the
Blame it on the juice 
Looking at my booty like you don't know what to do
Baby, I know that you can't control it 
But my body like a swisher, just roll it 
I'ma give you one chance to fall in love 
Give you one chance, don't fuck this up 
Ah, ah, oh 
I'm tryna catch millions, I ain't tryna catch feelings 

[Chorus: Charli XCX, Lizzo & Both]
I blame it on your love 
Every time I fuck it up 
I blame it on your love, I do 
I blame it on your love

Every time I fuck it up

Go ahead, wash your face, got it sticky like paste
Hand-cuffed, wearin' lace, yeah, that's how I catch a case 
Want another taste, you can meet me at Chase 
Or catch me outside, I ain't comin' to your place
Eatin' all these sweets, fuck around and get a cavity
Used to call you Daddy, but now I call you my majesty
Hittin' me from the back, but not talkin' 'bout a battery
Let's bring a hundred girls to the room, what's your capacity?
Eatin' all these sweets, fuck around and get a cavity
Used to call you Daddy, but now I call you my majesty
Hittin' me from the back, but not talkin' 'bout a battery

Shake it, shake it, shake it, make you spray it like an aerosol

I don't shake it like that, mm

I don't shake it like that, uh

[Verse 2: CupcakKe]
I shake it like Jamaican
No birthday, but I'm cakin'
I shake it like I'm tryna get the oil off of the bacon
If I need wakin', I'ma alarm that shakin'
This ass 'bout to move like I need the house vacant
It move, move, move, and you know it won't stop
It shake it like I'm pulled over by a white cop
It shakin' like a virgin, 'bout to give up the box
Told 'em this ass a miracle, like my name Watts
I be purgin' shit, never nervous, bitch
I get on top of that dick, shake it like turbulence
You haven't heard from 'em since, I'm a different expense
And now this pussy need Staples like I'm fuckin' on Vince
Told 'em paddle, paddle, paddle 'cause this pussy in Seattle
I'ma fight my own battles, shake it harder than a rattle
He get in it, then he tackle, wanna bite it like a apple
And this pussy so juicy, when I cum it's made of Snapple, ayy

[Interlude: Brooke Candy]
Brooke muthafuckin' Candy, Charli XCX
Miss CupcakKe is on this muthafuckin' track, oh

[Verse 3: Brooke Candy]
Tell me what you want, tell me what you want, daddy
Little bit of sugar, little bit of Brooke Candy
Cocaine-colored sheets where my ass bouncin' 
'Bout to turn your mansion to the pussy palace
And shake it on ya like my ass on the Richter scale
My pussy crucify your body, it's the holy grail
My pussy lean, I got you sippin' from the two cup
I'm 'bout to shake my ass like I'm in a strip club
Hey, my ass is Magic City
Double D's, all-natural big titties
Shake it like a box-fresh vibrator
Ass first-class, fast like Concorde
Damn, my ass so insane
Put me in a straightjacket, still you ain't safe
You can't handle all the jelly, put it on a plate
I'm 'bout to shake and leave you shook, like Beyonc

[Chorus: Charli XCX & Pabllo Vittar]


Oh darling, you say you don't know me?

Please, haha



[Verse 4: Pabllo Vittar]
Pra comear direito eu soletro pra voc
Rainha se escreve com dois L e dois T
Como estagirio no trabalho, eu t sem tempo
Se tenho um problema eu resolvo com talento
Dedinho na boca, sou uma tentao
A pista pega fogo derretendo o paredo
J mostrei que eu sou queen, falo srio pra vocs
A coroa  pesada, mas eu me acostumei
I shake it, I shake it, o meu popozo
I shake it, I shake it, aguentar essa presso
Do MA, cheguei em LA
 a Pabllo e a Charli mais uma vez

[Chorus: Charli XCX & Pabllo Vittar]

I shake it, I shake

[Verse 1]
Don't say you love me 'cause I can't say it back
Don't say you're sorry 'cause you've done nothing bad
Swallow my feelings, but won't swallow my pride
You know I've got a suit of armor on, you'll never see me cry
I hate the silence , that's why the music's always loud
So many problems , I try to drown 'em out
1000 bottles , collecting souvenirs
You know it's so hard to admit it
But the only good inside of me is you

[Pre-Chorus]
I take all of these blue and yellow pills
But nothing seems to last like you
You're chasing after something that you'll never catch
Woah

[Chorus]
Like a white Mercedes, always been running too fast
When your heart is breaking, you keep on taking me back
Hate myself, I really love you
Hurting you feels like I'm hurting as well
All I know is I don't deserve you

[Verse 2]
You're so forgiving , my friends think you're the best
From the beginning , your friends said it wouldn't last
But this connection , it's something they don't see
You know it's so hard to admit it
But the best damn part of me was always you

[Pre-Chorus]
I take all of these blue and yellow pills
But nothing seems to last like you
You're chasing after something that you'll never catch
Woah

[Chorus]
Like a white Mercedes, always been running too fast
When your heart is breaking, you keep on taking me back
Hate myself, I really love you
Hurting you feels like I'm hurting as well
All I know is I don't deserve you

[Bridge]
I don't deserve you, I don't deserve your love
One day I'll pull through and I'll be good enough
I don't deserve you, I don't deserve your love
Oh, your love, yeah
I don't deserve you, I don't deserve your love
One day I'll pull through and I'll be good enough
I don't deserve you, I don't deserve your love
Oh, your love

[Chorus]
Like a white Mercedes, always been running too fast
When your heart is breaking, you keep on taking me back
Hate myself, I really love you
Hurting you feels like I'm hurting as well
All I know is I don't deserve you
All I know is I don't deserve you
All I know is I don't deserve you
All I know is I don't deserve youI go hard, I go fast
And I never look back
I go speedin' on the highway
Burn rubber, no crash
Turn the volume up in the party
Put your hands up and dance
Bump, bump, in the rave
Go forever and ever and

Bounce, never sleep
Push it all on repeat
I go speedin' on the highway
Flame burning, tire screech
Turn the volume up in your bedroom
Put your hands up and scream
Bump, bump, lights go out
Go forever and ever and

Drop, body high
Blue and pink like the sky
I go speedin' on the highway
Vroom vroomin', might die
Turn the volume up in your Prius
Windows down and just vibe
Bump, bump, in the rave
Go forever and ever and

Roll wit' your friends, out till 7 AM
Come on, meet me on the highway
Smoke blowing, let's race
Turn the volume up on the speakers
Got that look on your face
Bump, bump, in the rave
Go forever and ever and

I go hard, I go fast
And I never look back
I go speedin' on the highway
Burn rubber, no crash
Turn the volume up in the party
Put your hands up and dance
Bump, bump, in the rave
Go forever and ever and

Bounce, never sleep
Push it all on repeat
I go speedin' on the highway
Flame burning, tire screech
Turn the volume up in your bedroom
Put your hands up and scream
Bump, bump, lights go out
Go forever and ever and

Drop, body high
Blue and pink like the sky

Vroom vroomin', might die
Turn the volume up in your Prius

[Verse: Charli XCX & Clairo]
Know I keep on saying I'm alright
But every single night
When I cut off the lights
I feel like crying
Your picture revolving in my mind
But then it turns to white
I guess Ill go in blind
I feel like crying
Hope you can forgive all of my crimes
You read, but won't reply
I just need your reply
I feel like crying
Baby, all I need's a single night
A sign, a sign, give me a sign

[Chorus: Charli XCX]
Sorry I broke you down
Sorry I tore your heart
I ripped it all apart
Your headlights in the dark
Sorry bout Grammy night
Was flyin' out my mind
Was in a different place
Tortured and drifting by
Kept dancing in that house
The windows turned to black
My windows turned to black
My eyes were rolling back, yeah
Hope I get one more chance
Hope I get one more call
I only know what's good once I have lost it all
Lost it all, lost it all, lost it all
Lost it all, lost it all, lost it all

[Post-Chorus: Charli XCX]
Hope you can forgive the things I've done

Hope you can forgive the things I've done

Hope you can forgive the things Ive done

Hope you can forgive the things I've done

Reply, reply, give me a sign
Yeah

I know your type, think you're one in a million
Your diamonds are fake, you ain't golden
But I only fuck with the ones who are rare enough
Real enough, down to keep goin'

And I'm goin' all in, I'm busy ballin'
Funny how wherever I wanna go
You wanna be there too

[Pre-Chorus]
Pull up and stunt with your clique 
Glacier all up on your wrist 
Think you're the sickest like you got diseases
But you ain't got nothing on this

Would you stick around for the come down?

Wait for me heaven, I'm here 'til I die
Ah, ah

You want a piece 'cause it's tasty
We on a roll, we don't stop 'til the bottles all popped

I'm busy ballin'
Funny how wherever I wanna go
You wanna be there too

[Pre-Chorus]
Pull up and stunt with your clique 
Glacier all up on your wrist

Oh!
There's no wifi in forest
I found a better connection 
No mirrors nearby, but I see a better reflection
I was fucked by the nature, we didn't use protection
Made a lot of trees, they are now in a book section
No cameras, no lights, but a lot of action 
Yeah, summer turnin' winter
C'mon, little mama Jackson
Flow like water 
No Beats by Dre, but beats by your father

Switch it up, bipolar

Got an angel, got me real closer
Running it just like a halo, yeah
Never let me go, never let me go, no
Want a little more
When it rains, it pours, yeah

Wind it up and then we fast-forward
Leave a message, hit record on ya

I can't escape all the voices, and so, I turn it up
I go to parties with strangers, so I can figure it out
Run through a city at midnight to feel like a star
I want it all, even if it's fake

[Pre-Chorus: Charli XCX]
Breakin' your heart, split it in half
Told you it all 
Year and a half, are we in love?
I'll never know 
I know I'm wrong, what a mistake
I'll never change 
I can't escape all the voices, and so, I turn it up

In the backseat
Your song, so loud
Drivin' so fast
I'm better off alone

All alone, all alone, all alone
All alone, all alone, all alone, all alone, all alone
All alone, all alone, all alone, all alone
All alone, all alone, all alone, all alone
All alone, all alone, all alone, all alone

I'm wide awake, lyin' next to him, and feel it all
I got a thirst for distraction that I can't take back
My fingers run through his hair
I'm grippin' at regrets
I put my mouth on his lips to taste

[Pre-Chorus: Carly Rae Jepsen]
Breakin' your heart, split it in half
Told you it all 
Year and a half, are we in love?
I'll never know 
All that went wrong, what a mistake
I'll never change 
I can't escape all the voices, and so I turn it up

In the backseat
Your song, so loud
Drivin' so fast
I'm better off alone

Fake words, they don't count, no
Yeah, I know your game
And you played it right
Wish you knew before but my love is blind
One rose layin' on your grave 'cause
You pushed everyone away, oh
Tell your new lover to enjoy the ride
Pop the Chardonnay, kiss her lips goodbye, yeah

[Pre-Chorus: M]
You won't hear my teardrops when they're fallin'
Engine drownin' out the sound, you hear me comin'
Went and got it all, just to prove you wrong
Yeah, you spent my love, oh
Didn't spend my money, babe

[Chorus: Charli XCX, M & Both]
'Cause I've been fantasizin' 'bout a Porsche 
Get that dough-oh-oh-oh 
I've been kneadin', kneadin' 'til I'm sore 
'Til it grow-oh-oh-oh 
I've been runnin' 'round now for so long
Yeah, it seems like
Every day and everywhere I go
Yeah, I see ya 
Baby, I just gotta let you know 
I made dough-oh-oh-oh

[Outro: Charli XCX & M]
Yeah, yeah

Yeah, I've been fantasizin' 'bout it
Yeah, yeah
Yeah-yeah
Yeah, I let you know it's like
Yeah, yeah
Yeah-yeah

[Verse 1]
Hard to read, you could be OCD
You could be bad for me, you could say anything
Sometimes I get a bit TMI, little bit scared of heights
Little afraid to say
You know the things that make me smile
The face I make before my tears fall down
The things that I feel when you're acting suspicious
You know the place I run to hide
I take my problems there to work em out

[Chorus]
The things that I say when you don't wanna listen
Things that you say when I make bad decisions
Things that we do by the sink in my kitchen
I remember our first date
No chocolate and no bouquet
But the way that you kissed me
These are the things that could make us official

[Verse 2]
Look at us, isn't it obvious?
Is it so dangerous? Is it so complicated?
You know the shapes my body makes
Under the sheets at 4 AM with you
The things that we break when were switchin' positions
You know the words to my mistakes
You understand because you made 'em too

[Chorus]
The things that I say when you don't wanna listen
Things that you say when I make bad decisions
Things that we do by the sink in my kitchen
I remember our first date
No chocolate and no bouquet
But the way that you kissed me
These are the things that could make us official

[Bridge]
All of the things that we sometimes forget
All of the dreams that you put in my head
I'm still asleep, but there's breakfast in bed
These are the things that could make us official
Maybe the sky might not always be blue
All of my wishes will never come true
It doesn't matter 'cause Im here with you
This stuff could make us official
So tell all your friends cause we're goin official

[Chorus]
Things that you say when I make bad decisions
Things that we do by the sink in my kitchen
I remember our first date
No chocolate and no bouquet
But the way that you kissed me
These are the things that could make us official
These are the things that could make us official
These are the things that could make us official
I remember our first date
No chocolate and no bouquet
But the way that you kissed me
These are the things that could make us official

Even though, even though, even though
It hurts what you put me through
Holdin' on, holdin' on, holdin' on, holdin' on
You're the one, you're the one, you're the one

It hurts what you put me through
Holdin' on, holdin' on, holdin' on, holdin' on, yeah

[Chorus: Charli XCX]
It's 3 A.M. and you are callin' 
You say you're sorry, but you're lonely 
You know the words that got me fallin'
I got to pull up, pull up
Pull up, pull up
Pull up, pull up right to your love
One thousand times, the same old story 
I hate myself, I can't control it 
You know the words that got me fallin'

Pull up, pull up
Pull up, pull up right to your love

Let it go, let it go, let it go
My friends keep on tellin' me
Let it go, let it go, let it go
I just don't care
Even though, even though, even though
I know that you're usin' me
Holdin' on, holdin' on, holdin' on, holdin' on
Feelin' good, feelin' good, feelin' good
It's better than ecstasy
Feelin' good, feelin' good, feelin' good
You take me there
Even though, even though, even though
I know this is bad for me
Holdin' on, holdin' on, holdin' on, holdin' on, yeah

[Chorus: Charli XCX]
It's 3 A.M. and you are callin' 
You say you're sorry, but you're lonely

Pull up, pull up
Pull up, pull up
Pull up, pull up right to your love

[Verse 3: M & Charli XCX]
In the beginning, I thought you were amazin'
And none of my friends could stop me from chasin' you
I was too blind to see through all the flames, babe
But now, I don't wanna care anymore
Yes, all the things she said to me, just a lie
How could I be so dumb?
I don't wanna care anymore 
You're just pretty, you're not free
I'm so over your vanity
Oh man, I don't wanna care anymore 
No, no, no, no

[Chorus: Charli XCX & ]
It's 3 A.M. and you are callin' 
Go fuck yourself, don't say you're sorry 
I can't believe I used to want this
No more, no
Pull up, pull up
Pull up, pull up
Pull up, pull up 
One thousand times, the same old story 
Forgive myself, now this is over 
I can't believe you had me fallin'
No more, no
Pull up, pull up
Pull up, pull up  
Pull up, pull up right to your love

[Outro: Charli XCX & M]
Uh, uh 
Da-da, ooh, your love

[Verse 1]
Love suicide
You and I drove for miles
Knew I'd be here, be here, be here withyou
KnewI'd be here,be here, be here with you
Wetook a dive in the blue, scared to lose
All my feelings, feelings, feelings for you
Knew I'd be here, be here, be here with you

[Pre-Chorus]
Yeah, now we gotta let this go
Drove the car off the road
I gotta give you time to grow
You're not a ghost, you're in my head
I didn't wanna leave you low
Drove the car off the road
I hope you get some time to grow
You're not a ghost, you're in my head 

[Chorus]
I will always love you 
I'll love you forever
Even when we're not together
I will always love you 
I'll love you forever
Said, "I'll love you forever"
I know in the future 
We won't see each other 
Cold just like December
But I will always love you 
I'll love you forever
Yeah, I'll love you forever

[Post-Chorus]
In my head, in my head

[Verse 2]
You take your time, I'll take mine, we'll be fine
Knew I'd be here, be here, be here with you
When the roof caved in and the water fell through
Hope when we're old, we'll be friends, reminisce
Hope we'll be there, be there, be there, us two
All the memories, all the photos we took

[Pre-Chorus]
Yeah, now we gotta let this go
Drove the car off the road
I gotta give you time to grow
You're not a ghost, you're in my head
I didn't wanna leave you low
Drove the car off the road
I hope you get some time to grow
You're not a ghost, you're in my head

[Chorus]
I will always love you 
I'll love you forever
Even when we're not together
I will always love you 
I'll love you forever
Said, "I'll love you forever"

We won't see each other 
Cold just like December
But I will always love you 
I'll love you forever
Yeah, I'll love you forever
I will always love you 
I'll love you forever 
Even when we're not together
I will always love you 
I'll love you forever
Said, "I'll love you forever" 
I know in the future 
We won't see each other
Cold just like December
But I will always love you 
I'll love you forever
Yeah, I'll love you forever

[Break]

[Outro]
Front of my mind, in the front of my mind
You stay right in front, in the front of my mind
Front of my mind, in the front of my mind
You stay right in front, in the front of my mind
Front of my mind, never leave you behind
We say promises and we give up the lies
Front of my mind, in the front of my mind
You stay right in front of my mind

[Intro: Charli XCX]
Dealer, dealer, dealer
Eh-eh-XCX

[Chorus: Charli XCX]

And baby, you the love of my life
Selling all the drugs that I like
Baby, you got it

[Verse 1: Charli XCX]
Calling out for your love
Baby, Im calling out, I cant do without you
Put ecstasy on my tongue and thats all Im tasting now
Youre luxurious, Im stuck
Champagne, cigarettes, convertibles
Its bout to pop off
Bitin' on a rose, you make me cum
Im way up, rooftop
You hurt me when you stop
I just cant get enough, dealer

[Chorus: Charli XCX]
Baby, you the love of my life
Selling all the drugs that I like

[Verse 2: ABRA & Charli XCX]
I was never great at dealing with no comedown
So feel free to come 'round when you wanna come 'round
Youre my favourite drug, just take me to your underworld
And put me on your tongue, hallucinate until your toes curl
Tsu-tsunami, you cant stop me now, Im peaking too
Off the kiki and hypnotic, Im not through with you
When you cum, it feels like diamonds raining down on me
When Im with you, heaven on Earth is not a fantasy
Roll the windows down, my wrists awry, you got me so cold
Bitin' on a flower, blood like water down from my nose
It hurts, but I cant stop
I just cant get enough


[Chorus: Charli XCX & ABRA]
Baby, you the love of my life
Selling all the drugs that I like

Baby, you got it
You know I want it 
And baby, you the love of my life

Selling all the drugs that I like

You know I want it

[Interlude: Charli XCX]
Dealer, dealer, dealer, ooh
Dealer, dealer, dealer
Baby, you the love of my life
Selling all the drugs that I like, yeah

You gotta tell me the reason

Why, why, why?
Don't you lie, what do you want?
Fall in love, ah, risk it all

[Verse 1: Charli XCX]
Tell me what you want
'Cause I know that you're lonely on your own
We're out in L.A. for a month
I don't think I can hide my emotions no, no more 
A late night, say you want me, say you're selfish
Think about my body, then two-time
Say you want her? Do you want her?
Doesn't do it like me, no
So hot, burn the place down
Give you what you need

[Chorus: Charli XCX]
So you gotta tell me the reason
Why we can't fall in love
You gotta tell me the reason
Why you won't open up
Know I'ma send you to heaven
Tequila on your tongue
You gotta tell me the reason
Why we can't fall in love


[Post-Chorus: Charli XCX]
Why, why, why?
Don't you lie, what do you want?
Fall in love, ah, risk it all

[Verse 2: HAIM]
Make me wanna fall in love
Baby, make mistakes
Hit me with a champagne kiss
And now I'm not thinkin' straight
Look at the skyline high
I look up, I wish I saw your face
I wanna fall in love
Jump in the deep end
'Cause deep down, you're d-dying
Tell me you're kinda nervous
Tell me you feel the same
I wish it was more than surface
I wish I could feel nothing
Come give me everything
Burn down and go again

[Chorus: HAIM]
So you gotta tell me the reason
Why we can't fall in love
You gotta tell me the reason
Why you won't open up
Know I'ma send you to heaven
Tequila on your tongue
And you gotta tell me the reason
Why we can't fall in love

[Outro: HAIM & Charli XCX]
Ooh, baby
Why, why, why
Tell me, tell me, tell me the reason
Know you lie, what do you want

Tell me the reason
Tell me the reason, oh yeah
You gotta tell me the reason
Tell me the reason
Tell me the reason
Tell me the reason

[Verse 1]
Always been a little bit fast and wild
My mama always said I was a problem child
I'm just livin' life until the day I die
It's all I know, that's how I roll

[Pre-Chorus]
I party, get naughty
Always tellin' myself I'll never do this again
I'm sorry that you caught me
Fuckin' in the hotel, it didn't mean anything

[Chorus]
Don't let me, don't let me go
I just wanna let you know that I'm no angel
But I can learn, oh
Baby, I'm bad to the bone
I just wanna let you know that I'm no angel
But I can learn

[Verse 2]
The second that you saw me, you were mesmerized
Bet you probably thought I was your ride or die
Don't wanna burst your bubble, but I cheat and lie
It's the truth, I'm bad news

[Pre-Chorus]
I party, get naughty
Always tellin' myself, I'll never do this again
I'm sorry that you caught me
Fuckin' in the hotel, it didn't mean anything

[Chorus]
Don't let me, don't let me go
I just wanna let you know that I'm no angel
But I can learn, oh
Baby, I'm bad to the bone
I just wanna let you know that I'm no angel
But I can learn, oh

[Post-Chorus]
Promise I'll try, promise I'll try 
Promise I'll try, promise I'll try 
I'm no angel, but I can learn

[Bridge]
Ooh, feels so good, feels so good, feels so good
Maybe you're just too good for me
But you're in too deep, yeah
Ooh, I get stressed out, it's too much, the pressure is on
And I can't quite breathe
If I go there, pull me right back, yeah

[Chorus]
Don't let me, don't let me go
I just wanna let you know that I'm no angel
But I can learn, oh
Baby, I'm bad to the bone
I just wanna let you know that I'm no angel
But I can learn, oh

[Post-Chorus]
Promise I'll try, promise I'll try 
Promise I'll try, promise I'll try 
I'm no angel, but I can learn

[Chorus]
You said you wanna bang
Well, fuck you, sucker!

[Verse 1]
Head bang , pink rocks 
Gold fangs , shit hot
Brick walls, don't stop
My hands, fresh cuts 

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh dear God, do you get me now, do you get me now, oh, you do?
Wow, you're awesome
Oh dear God, I'm a killer now, I'm a killer now, so are you

Oh dear God, do you get me now, do you get me now, oh, you do?
Wow you're awesome
Oh dear God, I'm a killer now, I'm a killer now

Sitting on a plastic speedboat
In the ultraviolet ocean
Playing cool songs
Trying to show off
Wow you're awesome
Wow you're awesome

Bang, bang
Bang, bang

Fuck you! Sucker!
Sucker!

Do you feel alright?
Do you need me by your side?
We go out all night
Makes the pain hurt a little less
Do it one more time
'Cause it feels so justified
We go out all night
See you fall, pick you up again

[Pre-Chorus]
If your eyes are sad, it makes me sad too
You got me so overprotective, it's true
Feel like I would jump off buildings for you
It's okay, I'll watch you cry all night
I promise I won't let you go

[Chorus]
I'll pull you close, so close, so close
I'll never let you go, you know
Head on my chest, a silver cross
You can cry all night, I'll never let you go

Head on my chest, a silver cross
You can cry all night, I'll never let you go

Lie awake till dawn 
We're face to face and palm to palm
Do you feel okay?
All your problems are far away 
Lying till it's true 
It's alright, I'm trusting you
Do you feel okay?
Take a breath, make you feel safe

[Pre-Chorus]
If your eyes are sad, it makes me sad too
You got me so overprotective, it's true
Feel like I would jump off buildings for you

Right down to where I fall apart
Wish me luck , wish me luck 
Drive through the night
Head on your shoulder
But I miss you so much
So, so much

[Chorus: Charli XCX]
Say your name, so nervously now
Kiss in the hallway, fade out
Tears are rollin' down my face, tears are rollin' down my face
Tears are rollin' down my face, now you gotta go, go, go
Tried to hide the lies when we touch
But in the sheets with no love
Tears are rollin' down my face, tears are rollin' down my face
Tears are rollin' down my face, now you gotta go, go, go

[Verse 2: Caroline Polachek & Charli XCX]
We used to be 5 star, yeah
Golden, golden
When I had nothing, you gave me silhouette dreams and
We made them real, somethin' I feel
I killed our life, I'm crazy
Throwin' all the china all around the kitchen
I kicked the ladder under you
Playin' dumb, shut tight, that ain't love, no
That ain't love

[Chorus: Caroline Polachek]
Say your name, so nervously now
Kiss in the hallway, fade out
Tears are rollin' down my face, tears are rollin' down my face
Tears are rollin' down my face, now you gotta go, go, go
I tried to hide the lies when we touch
But in the sheets with no love
Tears are rollin' down my face, tears are rollin' down my face
Tears are rollin' down my face, now you gotta go, go, go

[Post-Chorus: Charli XCX & Caroline Polachek]
Tears are rollin' down my face, holdin' on until we break
Now we're in a different place

And I can feel my body ache, tears are rollin' down my face
Now you gotta go, go, go, go
Tears are rollin' down my face, holdin' on until we break
Now we're in a different place

And I can feel my body ache, tears are rollin' down my face
Now you gotta go, go, go, go

[Outro: Caroline Polachek & Charli XCX]
Say your name
Fade out
Down my face
Go, go
Tried to hide the lies when we touch
But in the sheets with no love
Tears are rollin' down my face, tears are rollin' down my face
Lies when
Tears are rollin' down my face, now you gotta go, go, go

[Verse 1]
Laying in silence
You were a diamond, bright
Yeah, touching my fingertips
Melting into the night, oh
Secrets are locked up
Prison cell in your mind
Kisses fall on her lips
Kisses that should've been mine, yeah

[Chorus]
I don't wanna know
I don't wanna know
I don't wanna know
What you've done, what you've done
What you've done, what you've done
I don't wanna know
I don't wanna know
Who you love, who you love
Who you love
I know I'm losing you, so come on, tell the truth
Don't you tell me you're sorry, don't pretend you still want me
'Cause I don't wanna know, I already know
What you've done, what you've done
What you've done, what you've done, ooh, ooh
What you've done, what you've done
What you've done, ooh, ooh, ooh

[Verse 2]
Fighting the tears back
Fighting to make you stay
Screaming at angels
Holding a wall in my brain, yeah
Secrets are locked up
Prison cell in your heart, yeah
Kisses fall on her lips
The memory's left behind

[Chorus]
I don't wanna know
I don't wanna know
I don't wanna know
What you've done, what you've done
What you've done, what you've done
I don't wanna know
I don't wanna know
Who you love, who you love
Who you love
I know I'm losing you, so come on, tell the truth
Don't you tell me you're sorry, don't pretend you still want me
'Cause I don't wanna know, I already know
What you've done, what you've done
What you've done, what you've done, ooh, ooh
What you've done, what you've done
What you've done, ooh, ooh, ooh

[Chorus]
Drivin' 'round in Hollywood, I can only think 'bout you
Everlasting pain and it weighs on my body, it's you
Did I lose it all? Did I fuck it up?
Are my friends really friends now or are they far gone?
On the drugs at a bar, took 'em all
Can't stop thinking 'bout you

[Verse 1]
Fucked up, I just wanna break glass
Phone calls, I just wanna talk back
Yeah, big attitude, just like a big stack
Braindead for days, am I gonna relapse? Yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
I don't wanna talk
I don't wanna smile, no, no
Got a couple problems
I don't wanna compromise, no, no 

[Chorus]
I'm drivin' 'round in Hollywood
I can only think 'bout you, you 
Everlasting pain and it weighs on my brain, like you
Did I lose it all? Did I fuck it up?
Are my friends really friends now or are they far gone?
On the drugs at a bar, took 'em all
Can't stop thinking 'bout you

[Verse 2]
Don't stop, I just wanna go fast
No sleep, I don't wanna relax
10 planes in five days, I been 'round the world and back again
Man I feel insane, I'm numb, can't stop the pain, no

[Pre-Chorus]
I don't wanna talk
I don't wanna smile, no, no
Got a couple problems
I don't wanna compromise, no, no

[Chorus]
Drivin' 'round in Hollywood, I can only think 'bout you
Everlasting pain and it weighs on my body, it's you
Did I fuck it up?
Are my friends really friends now? Are they all far gone? 
On the drugs at a bar, took 'em all
Can't stop thinking 'bout you

[Verse 1: Charli XCX]
If you're feeling real sad, just look on your wall
I'm your pin-up princess, yeah, you know who to call
Uh-huh, uh-huh
Uh-huh, uh-huh
I've got a million dollar smile, I can live in your dreams
With my angel wings and Fiorucci jeans
Uh-huh, uh-huh
Uh-huh, uh-huh

[Pre-Chorus 1: Charli XCX]
Close your eyes and lay back 
Think about us, we could burn up the second we touch
Yeah, let your mind just relax
We could play rough, make your blood rush, velveteen brush

[Chorus: Charli XCX]
Ill be your baby girl, your baby girl
Ill be your baby girl, your baby girl
Ill be your baby girl, your baby girl
Ill be your baby girl, your baby girl

[Verse 2: Uffie]
Gloss on my lips, pop, sun in my eyes
Go steal the liquor from inside
Wanna take a little sip with you
Wanna spend a little bit with you
Open the top, pop, drink in my glass
Here come the cop, cops, better drink fast
Wanna take a little sip with you
Wanna spend a little bit with you

[Pre-Chorus 2: Charli XCX]
Just close your eyes and lay back 
Think about us, we could burn up the second we fuck
Yeah, let your mind just relax
We could play rough, make your blood rush, velveteen brush

[Chorus: Charli XCX]
Ill be your baby girl, your baby girl
Ill be your baby girl, your baby girl
Ill be your baby girl, your baby girl
Ill be your baby girl, your baby girl

[Bridge: Charli XCX]
I'm hanging all alone
Let me live inside your world 
More than a fantasy
Let me be your baby girl 

[Chorus: Charli XCX]
Ill be your baby girl, your baby girl
Ill be your baby girl, your baby girl
Ill be your baby girl, your baby girl
Ill be your baby girl, your baby girl
Ill be your baby girl, your baby girl
Ill be your baby girl, your baby girl
Ill be your baby girl, your baby girl
Ill be your baby girl, your baby girl

[Outro: Charli XCX & Uffie]
Baby girl, your baby girl
I'll be your baby girl, your baby girl
Baby girl, your baby girl 
I'll be your baby girl, your baby girl

[Chorus]
Baby, you're so lu-lu-lu-lucky
Baby, you're so lu-lu-lu-lucky
You get away with it all
Baby, you're so lu-lu-lu-lucky
And even though you g-g-g-got me
You still want it all

[Verse]
So, can I ask you a question?
Do you ever feel guilt for what you done?
Call you, you got no reception
You're breakin' up
Tell you I believe you, but I don't

[Chorus]
And baby, you're so lu-lu-lu-lucky
And baby, you're so lu-lu-lu-lucky
You get away with it all
Baby, you're so lu-lu-lu-lucky
And even though you g-g-g-got me
You still want it all

[Verse]
So, can I ask you a question?
Do you ever feel guilt for what you done?
Call you, you got no reception
You're breakin' up
Tell you I believe you, but I don't

[Chorus]
And baby, you're so lu-lu-lu-lucky
But did you ever l-l-l-love me?
You're just way too numb , mmm, mmm
And baby, you're so lu-lu-lu-lucky
I know you never l-l-l-loved me
And I knew all along

[Outro]
All along
All along
All along
You don't love
No, you don't love

[Intro]
Eh-eh-XCX Charli

[Chorus]
I blame it on you, I blame it on you
Every lie you tell comes true 
But I still wanna be with you 
I blame it on you 
You, I blame it on you, I blame it on you
Every lie you tell comes true 
But I still wanna be with you 
I blame it on you 

[Verse 1]
We met in the springtime
So cool, you were all nice
Bright star, burnin so bright
Youre my type, youre all I want
Oh, your eyes cut deep like a sharp knife
Open my legs with the pressure and make me feel alright
Uh-huh, so good, but I know youre bad for me
You got control, and you love the game
But open my legs with the pressure and do it all again, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
Pull up in a new thing, wrists all fresh like, "Oh my God"
Ill stick like a group, I know exactly what I want
Bad boy make a bad girl good, boy youre driving me so wild
