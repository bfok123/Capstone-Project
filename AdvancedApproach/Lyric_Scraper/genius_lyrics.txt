Come with the Tony Romo for clowns and all the bozos
My AP goin' psycho, lil' mama bad like Michael
Can't really trust nobody with all this jewelry on you
My roof look like a no-show, got diamonds by the boatload

Had so many bottles, gave ugly girl a sip
Out the window of the Benzo, we get seen in the rent'
And I'm like "Whoa, man, my neck so goddamn cold”
Diamonds wet, my t-shirt soaked

My money thick, won't ever fold
She said, "Can I have some to hold?"
And I can't ever tell you no

[Chorus: Post Malone]
Damn, my AP goin' psycho, lil' mama bad like Michael

Stars on the roof, they matching with the jewelry

Never caught a feelin' this hard
Harder than the liquor I pour
Tell me you don't want me no more
But I can't let go, everybody told me so
Feelin' like I sold my soul

You said it, no, you said it

Ooh, I fall apart
Down to my core
Ooh, I fall apart

[Bridge]
Ice keep pourin' and the drink keep flowin'
Try to brush it off, but it keep on goin'
Covered in scars and I can't help showin'
Whippin' in the foreign and the tears keep rollin'
Ice keep droppin' and the drink keep flowin'
Try to brush it off, but it keep on goin'
All these scars, can't help from showin'
Whippin' in the foreign and the tears keep blowin', yeah

You prolly think that you are better now, better now
You only say that 'cause I'm not around, not around
You know I never meant to let you down, let you down
Woulda gave you anything, woulda gave you everything
You know I say that I am better now, better now
I only say that 'cause you're not around, not around
You know I never meant to let you down, let you down
Woulda gave you anything, woulda gave you everything
Oh-oh

[Verse 1]
I did not believe that it would end, no
Everything came second to the Benzo
You're not even speakin' to my friends, no
You knew all my uncles and my aunts though
Twenty candles, blow 'em out and open your eyes
We were lookin' forward to the rest of our lives
Used to keep my picture posted by your bedside
Now it's in your dresser with the socks you don't like
And I'm rollin', rollin', rollin', rollin'
With my brothers like it's Jonas, Jonas
Drinkin' Henny and I'm tryna forget
But I can't get this shit outta my head

[Chorus]
You prolly think that you are better now, better now
You only say that 'cause I'm not around, not around
You know I never meant to let you down, let you down
Woulda gave you anything, woulda gave you everything
You know I say that I am better now, better now
I only say that 'cause you're not around, not around
You know I never meant to let you down, let you down
Woulda gave you anything, woulda gave you everything

[Verse 2]
I seen you with your other dude
He seemed like he was pretty cool
I was so broken over you
Life, it goes on, what can you do?
I just wonder what it's gonna take (What's it gonna take?)
Another foreign or a bigger chain (Bigger chain)
Because no matter how my life has changed
I keep on looking back on better days

[Chorus]
You prolly think that you are better now, better now
You only say that 'cause I'm not around, not around
You know I never meant to let you down, let you down
Woulda gave you anything, woulda gave you everything
You know I say that I am better now, better now
I only say that 'cause you're not around, not around
You know I never meant to let you down, let you down
Woulda gave you anything, woulda gave you everything
Oh-oh

[Bridge]
I promise
I swear to you, I'll be okay
You're only the love of my life (Love of my life)

You prolly think that you are better now, better now

It's true that all that you know is all that you are
You said that it's all that you want and more
Fuck off and pour another drink
And tell me what you think
You know that I'm too drunk to talk right now
You put your cigarette out on my face
So beautiful, please, woman

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't break your back for me
I'll put you out of your misery

[Chorus]
Tell me that it's all okay (Tell me that it's all okay)
I've been waitin' on this all damn day (Waitin' on this all damn day)
Call me in the mornin', tell me how last night went
I'm here, but don't count on me to—

[Verse 2]
Stay a little longer if you convince me
And tell me all the things that you have against me
Every time we make up, the truth is fadin'
Everybody's blind when the view's amazin'
Damn, who are we right now?
Can we have a little conversation?
Figure it out with no intoxication
We carry on, what is our motivation?
We're never wrong, how the hell we gonna make it?
Maybe we're used to this
Tell me, what are we to do?
It's like we only play to lose
Chasin' pain with an excuse
I love that shit and so do you

[Pre-Chorus]
But don't break your back for me
I'll put you out of your misery

[Chorus]
Tell me that it's all okay (Tell me that it's all okay)
I've been waitin' on this all damn day (Waitin' on this all damn day)
Call me in the mornin', tell me how last night went
I'm here, but don't count on me to stay

Tell me that it's all okay (Tell me that it's all okay)
I've been waitin' on this all damn day (Waitin' on this all damn day)
Call me in the mornin', tell me how last night went
I'm here, but don't count on me to stay

[Verse 1]
Lighting stog after stog, I choke on the smoke
They tell me to quit, don't listen what I'm told
They help me forget that this world is so cold
I don't even know what I'm chasin' no more
Tell me what I want, just keep searchin' on
It's never enough, cup after cup
Blunt after blunt, I wouldn't give one if I could find a fuck
Ha, ha, ha, uh, in the cut and I put that on my momma
And my bitch called talkin' 'bout some drama
I swear there ain't no time for women on the come up
It's either pussy or the commas

[Chorus]
Man, I just wanna go flex
Gold on my teeth and on my neck
And I'm stone cold with the flex
With my squad and I'm smokin' up a check
Man, I just wanna go flex
Gold on my teeth and on my neck
And I'm stone cold with the flex
With my squad and I'm smokin' up a check

[Verse 2]
Uh, yeah, push the gas, get a motherfuckin' nose bleed
She ain't never met a youngin' do it like me
She got a man but she says she really like me
She doin' things to excite me
She sendin' all her friends snaps of my new tracks
'Cause all these hoes know what's about to come next
I hit my plug up, got the paper connect
I drop a couple bands I just wanna go

[Chorus]
Man, I just wanna go flex
Gold on my teeth and on my neck
And I'm stone cold with the flex
With my squad and I'm smokin' up a check
Man, I just wanna go flex
Gold on my teeth and on my neck
And I'm stone cold with the flex
With my squad and I'm smokin' up a check

[Bridge]
Knowing all of this, it just don't make a difference
I'm just talking shit to the ones that'll listen
I come with the heat man, I swear I'm never missing
And I'm still the same and I swear I'm never switching
Knowing all of this, it just don't make a difference
I'm just talking shit to the ones that'll listen
I come with the heat man, I swear I'm never missing
And I'm still the same and I swear I'm never switching

[Chorus]
Man, I just wanna go flex
Gold on my teeth and on my neck
And I'm stone cold with the flex
With my squad and I'm smokin' up a check
Man, I just wanna go flex
Gold on my teeth and on my neck
And I'm stone cold with the flex
With my squad and I'm smokin' up a check

[Outro]
Ooh, man, I just wanna go flex
Gold on my teeth and on my neck
And I'm stone cold with the flex, yeah
Ice cold with the flex
Haha, that shit hard

[Intro]
Yeah, yeah
Mmm, ayy

[Chorus]
Candy paint with the white on top
Lambo doors are the oo-op drop

Everybody say that I gotta be stopped (Stopped)
Even though my final form ain't unlocked (Locked)

Diamonds going crazy like they on the dance floor
Got a lot of ass, nothin' I can't handle

[Pre-Chorus]
Flavor lasts forever, you should try a sample (Goddamn)
Baby, I'm the boss like I'm Tony Danza (Tony Danza)

Hit my momma when I ride in that, oh

Take a second if you think about crossin' me

[Pre-Chorus]
It lasts forever, you should try a sample (Goddamn)

[Verse 1: Post Malone]
Me and Kurt feel the same, too much pleasure is pain
My girl spites me in vain, all I do is complain
She needs something to change, need to take off the e-e-edge
So fuck it all tonight
And don't tell me to shut up
When you know you talk too much
But you don't got shit to say (Say)

[Chorus: Post Malone]
I want you out of my head
I want you out of my bedroom tonight (Bedroom)
There's no way I could save you (Save you)
'Cause I need to be saved too
I'm no good at goodbyes

[Verse 2: Post Malone]
We're both actin' insane, but too stubborn to change
Now I'm drinkin' again, 80 proof in my veins
And my fingertips stained, looking over the e-e-edge
Don't fuck with me tonight
Say you needed this heart, then you got it (Got it)
Turns out that it wasn't what you wanted (Wanted)
And we wouldn't let go and we lost it
Now I'm a goner

[Chorus: Post Malone]
I want you out of my head (Head)
I want you out of my bedroom tonight (Bedroom)
There's no way I could save you (Save you)
'Cause I need to be saved too (Saved too)
I'm no good at goodbyes

[Verse 3: Young Thug]
I want you out of my life
I want you back here tonight
I'm tryna cut you, no knife
I wanna slice you and dice you
My argue possessive, it got you precise
Can you not turn off the TV? I'm watchin' the fight
I flood the garage, blue diamond, no shark
You're Barbie life doll, it's Nicki Minaj
You don't need a key to drive, your car on the charger
I just wanna see the side, the one that's unbothered (Yeah)
And I don't want ya to never go outside (Outside)
I promise if they play, my niggas slidin' (Slidin')
I'm fuckin' her, and the tour bus still ridin' (Ridin')
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Chorus: Post Malone]
I want you out of my head (Head)
I want you out of my bedroom tonight (Bedroom)
There's no way I could save you (Save you)
'Cause I need to be saved too (Saved too)
I'm no good at goodbyes

[Outro: Post Malone & Young Thug]
Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye (Bye, bye)
Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye (Bye, bye)

Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye (Bye, bye)
Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye (Bye, bye)
Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye (Bye, bye)

[Intro: Post Malone]
Oh-oh-oh

[Verse 1: Post Malone]
'Cause I can't take it no more
No, you ain't like them bitches
Tell them hoes adios
And you can drop your panties
Leave them shits at the door
Dior falls on the floor
I swear we been here before
I'm tryna see you from my own perspective
You all in my section tryna come to my session
We rollin' up pressure, you know that we flexin'
We bought all the bottles, we came with the models
Girl this a confession, I'm not like your exes
I came up from Texas, and now that we textin'
You can fly in whenever, now you undressin'
Panties on the dresser, your hair gettin' messed up
The feelin' we catchin', my love is a blessin'
Made love in that Lexus, made love in that Lexus
I know you remember (I know you remember)

[Chorus: Justin Bieber & Post Malone]
Tell me, is that déjà vu? (Ooh, ooh)

So let me point you in the right direction (Right direction)
It's so important that you get the message (Ooh)
Yeah, yeah, I gotta say, gotta say somethin' to you, you, you

If you wanna do what I wanna do
Well uhm-uhm-uhm
Well I guess that is just déjà vu

[Chorus: Justin Bieber & Post Malone]
Tell me, is that déjà vu? (Ooh, ooh)

[Bridge: Justin Bieber & Post Malone]
Tell me if you want it, baby
'Cause I know I can drive you crazy

Oh-oh, oh-oh
Show up in that new Mercedes
You already know I'm faded
Girl, I've been thinkin' about you lately
Oh-oh, oh-oh

[Chorus: Justin Bieber & Post Malone]
Tell me, is that déjà vu? (Ooh, ooh)

[Intro]
I've been looking for someone...
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh

[Verse 1]
And I've been looking for someone to put up with my bullshit
I can't even leave my bedroom so I keep pouring
And I ain't seen a light of day since, well, that's not important
It's been long
And I was feeling Whitney, me and my homies sip the Houston
Cars and clothes, thought I was winning, you knew I was losing
You told me to wake up but my clock always stays on snooze
And I'm done

[Chorus]
To each their own and find peace in knowing
Ain't always broken, but here's to hoping
Show no emotion, against your coding
Just act as hard as you can
You don't need a friend
Boy, you're the man

[Bridge]
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh

[Verse 2]
And I've been looking for someone that I can buy my drugs from
It seems like every plug ran east to Utah, became Mormons
Drought comes around, feels like I have no one to depend on
Sober, ugh
I had 80 beers on Tuesday night, I had nothing to do then
I put on a little Dwight and sang a happy tune
And lit a cigarette, stepped out the door, had an appearance
Drank more

[Chorus]
To each their own and find peace in knowing
Ain't always broken, but here's to hoping
Show no emotion, against your coding
Just act as hard as you can
You don't need a friend
Boy, you're the man

[Outro]
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh

[Verse 1]
Never know when someone comes and tries to take my life
I've been sleepin' with the .45 like every night
In the whip I pray to God I don't see flashin' lights
God damn, they right behind me
And I wake up everyday
I wake up every day with this anxiety
And they know where I stay
Got "Malone" on my plates
And they followin' me
Two hundred bands under the floor of the kitchen
A little more up in the walls and the ceilin'
Even family and friends started switchin'
Ever since I got that check, seen 'em itchin'

[Pre-Chorus]
Eyes open, I see you, I'm watchin' you
More people wanna be you, don't trust no one

[Chorus]
Tell me why I can get no relief (I can't get no sleep)
Wonderin' when they'll come for me
A paranoid man makes paranoid plans
I do what I can, but it's out of my hands
Strugglin' just to find my peace

[Verse 2]
Sometimes feel like I got no friends
Can't trust a soul, like I'm Snowden
Right by the bed, keep it loaded
Lord have mercy if they broke in
I don't ever sleep, yeah, I'm wide awake
If you try to pull up to my place
Beam is gonna hit you a mile away
I promise, one of us gonna die today
Helicopters in the sky
No, he can't escape the eyes
Politicians and the lies
Tell me, what's the point in pickin' sides?

[Chorus]
Tell me why I can get no relief (I can't get no sleep)
Wonderin' when they'll come for me
A paranoid man makes paranoid plans
I do what I can, but it's out of my hands
Strugglin' just to find my peace

[Bridge]
(Ayy) Mind is runnin' all day
Cost me more than money and I'm payin' the price, yeah
I ain't goin' nowhere
Killin' myself so I can make me a life, yeah
Minute after minute, never had a limit
Woke up every mornin', knew that I just had to get it
Windows always tinted, you ain't lookin' in it
Either way, I know they'll come for me again

[Chorus]
Tell me why I can get no relief (I can't get no sleep)
Wonderin' when they'll come for me
A paranoid man makes paranoid plans
I do what I can, but it's out of my hands
Strugglin' just to find my peace

[Intro]
Ahahah, yeah
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)

[Verse 1]
When you leave me, make me jump up off my roof
Didn't faze you, would've given you the moon
Even after everything that we've been through
I ain't never met nobody like you
Why you always tryna tell me that it's cool?
Need to quiet 'cause you never tell the truth
Felt like ballin' was the only thing to do
Trade my woman for some diamonds and a coupe

[Pre-Chorus]
When she's comin' for my heart, it feels like Armageddon
I'ma turn the tables, promise you will not forget it
Won't apologize, don't give a fuck if you're offended
No discussion, yeah we gotta go our separate ways
Won't take me down in flames
I don't even wanna know your name
Watch how everything is gonna change, yeah, ayy

[Chorus]
I'ma pull up in a Bentley
With a fuckin' hunnid thousand in my pocket, yeah, yeah
I'ma pull in, swang my door open
Stuntin', knowin' everybody watchin', yeah, yeah
And help another bitch out the whip
And I don't give a fuck if you don't like it, yeah, yeah
Just to show you that it's over
It don't matter what you gotta say about it, yeah
I'ma put that bitch pussy in a motherfuckin' bodybag
So you know that I'm never ever coming back
You kept your heart on the counter in a Prada bag
I used to never ever want to see the light of day, yeah
I was an idiot
Beggin' on my knees onto the floor
Now, I don't even want you anymore, anymore
It's over now
It's over now, yeah, yeah, yeah, ayy

[Verse 2]
Feels like a knife in my throat, you treat this like it's a joke
I bet you've done this before, I ain't surprised, yeah
I wasn't tryna let go, but you'll know why when I'm ghost
I hope you wind up alone, dead in my eyes, yeah
Ain't religious, only Christian when it's Dior
Only prayin' for the Amex and the gold
You ain't stop me, no, you only was a detour
Tried to drive me crazy, you ran out of road

[Pre-Chorus]
When she's comin' for my heart, it feels like Armageddon
I'ma turn the tables, promise you will not forget it
Won't apologize, don't give a fuck if you're offended
No discussion, yeah we gotta go our separate ways
Won't take me down in flames
I don't even wanna know your name
Watch how everything is gonna change (Is gonna change), yeah, ayy

[Chorus]
I'ma pull up in a Bentley
With a fuckin' hunnid thousand in my pocket, yeah, yeah
I'ma pull in, swang my door open
Stuntin', knowin' everybody watchin', yeah, yeah
And help another bitch out the whip
And I don't give a fuck if you don't like it, yeah, yeah (I don't give a fuck)
Just to show you that it's over
It don't matter what you gotta say about it, yeah (What you gotta say about it)
I'ma put that bitch pussy in a motherfuckin' bodybag (In a bodybag)
So you know that I'm never ever coming back (Never coming back)
You kept your heart on the counter in a Prada bag (In a Prada bag)
I used to never ever want to see the light of day, yeah
I was an idiot
Beggin' on my knees on to the floor (To the floor)
Now I don't even want you anymore, anymore
It's over now
It's over now
(It's over now)

'Cause he was an angel

One taught me love

Holding hands with my mama
I'll be thanking my dad
'Cause she grew from the drama
Only wanna do it once, real bad
Gon' make that shit last
God forbid something happens
Least this song is a smash (Song is a smash)

[Pre-Chorus]
I've got so much love (Love)
Got so much patience (Patience)
And I've learned from the pain (Pain)
I turned out amazing (Turned out amazing)
Say I've loved and I've lost (Yeah, yeah)
But that's not what I see (Yeah, yeah)
'Cause look what I've found (Yeah, yeah)
Ain't no need for searching
And for that, I say

[Chorus]
Thank you, next (Thank you, next)

[Verse 1]
Yeah, breakfast at Tiffany's and bottles of bubbles
Girls with tattoos who like getting in trouble
Lashes and diamonds, ATM machines
Buy myself all of my favorite things (Yeah)
Been through some bad shit, I should be a sad bitch
Who woulda thought it'd turn me to a savage?
Rather be tied up with calls and not strings
Write my own checks like I write what I sing, yeah (Yeah)

[Pre-Chorus]
My wrist, stop watchin', my neck is flossy
Make big deposits, my gloss is poppin'
You like my hair? Gee, thanks, just bought it

[Verse 2]
Wearing a ring, but ain't gon' be no "Mrs."
Bought matching diamonds for six of my bitches
I'd rather spoil all my friends with my riches
Think retail therapy my new addiction
Whoever said money can't solve your problems
Must not have had enough money to solve 'em
They say, "Which one?" I say, "Nah, I want all of 'em"
Happiness is the same price as red-bottoms

[Pre-Chorus]
My smile is beamin' (Yeah), my skin is gleamin' (Is gleamin')
The way it shine, I know you've seen it (You've seen it)
I bought a crib just for (Just for) the closet (Closet)

You like my hair? Gee, thanks, just bought it (Oh yeah)

[Verse 3]
Yeah, my receipts be lookin' like phone numbers
If it ain't money, then wrong number
Black card is my business card
The way it be settin' the tone for me
I don't mean to brag, but I be like, "Put it in the bag," yeah
When you see them racks, they stacked up like my ass, yeah
Shoot, go from the store to the booth
Make it all back in one loop, gimme the loot
Never mind, I got the juice
Nothing but net when we shoot
Look at my neck, look at my jet
Ain't got enough money to pay me respect
Ain't no budget when I'm on the set
If I like it, then that's what I get, yeah

[Chorus]
I want it, I got it, I want it, I got it (Oh yeah)
I want it, I got it, I want it, I got it (Oh yeah, yeah)
You like my hair? Gee, thanks, just bought it
I see it, I like it, I want it, I got it (I see, yep)

[Chorus]
You, you love it how I move you
You love it how I touch you, my one

And I, I feel it after midnight
A feelin' that you can't fight, my one
It lingers when we're done
You'll believe God is a woman

[Verse 1]

You ain't got a one-track mind, yeah

Baby, lay me down and let's pray
I'm tellin' you the way I like it, how I want it

[Pre-Chorus]

I tell you all the things you should know
So baby, take my hands, save your soul
We can make it last, take it slow, hmm
And I can tell that you know I know how I want it, yeah
But you're different from the rest
And boy, if you confess, you might get blessed
See if you deserve what comes next
I'm tellin' you the way I like it, how I want it

[Pre-Chorus]
(Yeah) And I can be all the things you told me not to be

Some days, things just take
Way too much of my energy
I look up and the whole room's spinning
You take my cares away
I can so over-complicate, people tell me to medicate

[Pre-Chorus]
Feel my blood runnin', swear the sky's fallin'

Don't know what else to try, but you tell me every time

And oh, I gotta keep, keep on breathin'

You remind me of a time
When things weren't so complicated
All I need is to see your face

Feel my blood runnin', swear the sky's fallin'
I know that all this shit's fabricated

Knew you were perfect after the first kiss
Took a deep breath like, "Ooh"

If you take too long to hit me back
I can't promise you how I’ll react
But all I can say is at least I'll wait for you
Lately, I've been on a roller coaster
Tryna get a hold of my emotions
But all that I know is I need you close

[Pre-Chorus]
I’ma scream and shout for what I love
Passionate, but I don't give no fucks
I admit that I'm a lil' messed up
But I can hide it when I'm all dressed up
I'm obsessive and I love too hard
Good at overthinking with my heart
How you even think it got this far, this far?

[Chorus]
And I can be needy, way too damn needy
I can be needy, tell me how good it feels to be needed
I can be needy, so hard to please me
I know it feels so good to be needed

[Verse 2]
Sorry if I'm up and down a lot (Yeah)
Sorry that I think I'm not enough
And sorry if I say sorry way too much
You can go ahead and call me selfish (Selfish)
But after all this damage, I can’t help it (Help it)
But what you can trust is I need your touch

[Pre-Chorus]
I’ma scream and shout for what I love
Passionate, but I don't give no fucks
I admit that I’m a lil' messed up
But I can hide it when I'm all dressed up
I'm obsessive and I love too hard
Good at overthinking with my heart
How you even think it got this far, this far?

[Chorus]
And I can be needy, way too damn needy
I can be needy, tell me how good it feels to be needed
I can be needy, so hard to please me

I know you hear me when I cry
I try to hold it in at night
While you're sleeping next to me
But it's your arms that I need this time (This time)
Look at the cards that we've been dealt
If you were anybody else
Probably wouldn't last a day
Every tear's a rain parade from hell (From hell)

[Pre-Chorus]
Baby, you do it so well
You've been so understanding, you've been so good
And I'm puttin' you through more than one ever should
And I'm hating myself 'cause you don't want to
Admit that it hurts you

[Chorus]
I know that it breaks your heart when I cry again
Over him, mmh
I know that it breaks your heart when I cry again
'Stead of ghostin' him

[Post-Chorus]
We'll get through this, we'll get past this, I'm a girl with
A whole lot of baggage
But I love you, we'll get past this, I'm a girl with
A whole lot of baggage, oh yeah

[Verse 2]
Though I wish he were here instead
Don't want that living in your head
He just comes to visit me
When I'm dreaming every now and then (And then)
And after all that we been through (And after all that we been through)
There's so much to look forward to
What was done and what was said
Leave it all here in this bed with you (With you)

[Pre-Chorus]
Baby, you do it so well
You've been so understanding, you've been so good
And I'm puttin' you through more than one ever should
And I'm hating myself 'cause you don't want to
Admit that it hurts you, baby

To bring the bitter taste to a halt (Sheesh, sheesh!)

[Chorus: Ariana Grande & Pharrell]
And then you get it, get it, get it, get it (Ayy)
Hit it, hit it, hit it, hit it (Ayy)
Flip it, flip it, flip it
You make me say oh (Sheesh!), oh (Sheesh!)
Twist it, twist it, twist it, twist it
Mix it and mix it and mix it and mix it
Kiss it, kiss it, kiss it (Sweetener, sweetener, sweetener, sweet)
You make me say oh (Sheesh!), oh (Sheesh!)
You make me say oh, babe!
Hey, ayy, oh yeah…

[Intro: Shangela Laquifa Wadley]
This is one small step for woman
One giant leap for woman-kind

[Verse 1]
I'd rather be alone tonight
You can say "I love you" through the phone tonight
Really don’t wanna be in your arms tonight
I'll just use my covers to stay warm tonight
Think I'm better off here all alone tonight
Ain’t no checkin' on when I get home tonight
Just makin' sure I'm good on my own tonight
Even though there isn't nothin' wrong tonight

[Pre-Chorus]
Yeah, I'm just sayin', baby
I can’t really miss you if I’m with you
And when I miss you, it'll change the way I kiss you
Baby, you know time apart is beneficial
It’s like I'm the universe and you be N-A-S-A

[Chorus]
Give you the whole world, I'ma need space
I'ma need space, I’ma, I'ma need
You know I'm a star; space, I'ma need space
I'ma need space, I'ma, I'ma need space (N-A-S-A)
Give you the whole world, I'ma need space
I'ma need space, I'ma, I'ma need
You know I'm a star; space, I'ma need space
I'ma need space, I'ma, I'ma need space (N-A-S-A)

[Verse 2]
Bottom line
Usually, I would love it if you stayed the night
I just think I'm on another page tonight
It ain't nothing wrong with saying I need me time
Usually, I would orbit around you
But gravity seems to be the only thing that's pulling me
You'll be my rise and shine soon as them stars align, mmm

[Pre-Chorus]
Baby, I can't really miss you if I'm with you
And when I miss you, it'll change the way I kiss you
Baby, you know time apart is beneficial
It's like I'm the universe and you be N-A-S-A

[Chorus]
Give you the whole world, I'ma need space
I'ma need space, I'ma, I'ma need
You know I'm a star; space, I'ma need space
I'ma need space, I'ma, I'ma need space (N-A-S-A)
Give you the whole world, I'ma need space
I'ma need space, I'ma, I'ma need
You know I'm a star; space, I'ma need space
I'ma need space, I'ma, I'ma need space (N-A-S-A)

[Bridge]
You don't wanna leave me, but I'm tryna self-discover
Keep me in your orbit and you know you'll drag me under
You don't wanna leave me, but I'm tryna self-discover
(You don't wanna leave me, but I'm tryna self-discover)
Keep me in your orbit and you know you'll drag me under
(Keep me in your orbit and you know you'll drag me under)

[Outro]
I'd rather be alone tonight
You can say "I love you" through the phone tonight

[Verse 1: Ariana Grande]
Last night, boy, I met you, yeah
When I was asleep ('Sleep)
You're such a dream to me, mmm, woah
And it was on a day like this, yeah
If you can believe, if you can believe (If you can believe)
You're such a dream to me

[Chorus: Ariana Grande]
Before you speak, don't move
'Cause I don't wanna wake up
Wake up, wake up, wake up
Don't wanna wake up, oh
Wake up, wake up, wake up
Boy, you're such a dream
If you can believe, babe
Boy, you're such a dream to me

[Verse 2: Ariana Grande]
"Excuse me, um, I love you"
I know that's not the way to start a conversation, trouble
I watch them other girls when they come and bug you
But I felt like I knew you, so I just wanted to hug you
Plus you don't know your way around
You can stop your playing now
All your worries, lay 'em down, shh, don't say it loud
Is this real, baby?
(Bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum)
You're like: "I love you—who starts a conversation like that?" Nobody, but I do
But you are not a picture, I can't cut you up and hide you
I'll get you out my mind, mhm, or try to
But I just want to stand and yell
I will never dare to tell
Think I heard some wedding bells, shh, keep it to yourself
Is this real? (Is this real?)

[Chorus: Ariana Grande]
Before you speak, don't move
'Cause I don't wanna wake up
Wake up, wake up, wake up
Don't wanna wake up, oh no
Wake up, wake up, wake up
'Cause you're such a dream
If you can believe
You're such a dream to me, mmm, boy

[Verse 3: Ariana Grande & Pharrell Williams]
I could buy you anything, but I cannot buy you
Before your boy gets smart, I would never try to
You know I'm thinking to myself, "What happened? Why you?"
But when I see you in my dreams, psh, I know
You know how to treat it, you know how to eat it
You know how to beat it (I know how to keep it)
The Good Housekeeping Seal
(Bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum)
I don't just wanna touch you
I'm tryna turn two single people into a couple
What's your next month like? Tell me what you're up to
We can leave right now, boy, you don't need a duffel
What about La Perla? Let Vickie keep her secret
Boy, it ain't no secret if I know you're gonna peep it, oh

[Chorus: Ariana Grande]
Before you speak, don't move
'Cause I don't wanna wake up
Wake up, wake up, wa-wake up
Wake up, wake up, wake up, wa-wake up
(No I don't want, no)
'Cause you're such a dream (Does this end?)
If you can believe, you're such a dream to me
To me, mmm, boy, to me

[Verse 1]
I'm so into you, I can barely breathe
And all I wanna do is to fall in deep
But close ain't close enough, 'til we cross the line, hey yeah
So name a game to play, and I'll roll the dice, hey

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh baby, look what you started
The temperature's rising in here
Is this gonna happen?
Been waiting and waiting for you to make a move
Before I make a move

[Chorus]
So, baby, come light me up, and, baby, I'll let you on it
A little bit dangerous, but, baby, that's how I want it
A little less conversation and a little more touch my body
'Cause I'm so into you, into you, into you
Got everyone watchin' us, so, baby, let's keep this secret
A little bit scandalous, but, baby, don't let them see it
A little less conversation and a little more touch my body
'Cause I'm so into you, into you, into you, oh, yeah

[Verse 2]
This could take some time, hey
Made too many mistakes
Better get this right, right, baby

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, baby, look what you started
The temperature's rising in here
Is this gonna happen?
Been waiting and waiting for you to make a move
Before I make a move

[Chorus]
So, baby, come light me up, and, baby, I'll let you on it
A little bit dangerous, but, baby, that's how I want it
A little less conversation and a little more touch my body
'Cause I'm so into you, into you, into you
Got everyone watchin' us, so, baby, let's keep this secret
A little bit scandalous, but, baby, don't let them see it
A little less conversation and a, little more touch my body
'Cause I'm so into you, into you, into you, oh yeah
('Cause I'm so into you)

[Bridge]
Tell me what you came here for
'Cause I can't, I can't wait no more
I'm on the edge with no control
And I need, I need you to know
You to know, oh

[Chorus]
So, baby, come light me up, and, baby, I'll let you on it
A little bit dangerous, but, baby, that's how I want it
A little less conversation and a little more touch my body
'Cause I'm so into you, into you, into you
Got everyone watchin' us, so, baby, let's keep this secret
A little bit scandalous, but, baby, don't let them see it
A little less conversation and a little more touch my body
'Cause I'm so into you, into you, into you

[Outro]
So come light me up
So come light me up, my baby
Little dangerous
A little dangerous, my boy
A little less conversation and a little more touch my body
'Cause I'm so into you, into you, into you

[Intro: Wendy Rene]
After laughter comes tears
After laughter comes tears

[Verse 1]
Another night, another party, sayin' hi to everybody
I’m sorry, it's time to leave, I gotta leave now
Got somewhere I gotta be now, I'm starving
Can somebody walk me to my car?
If I go alone, I’m not gon' make it very far
I'm happy for the love and all of the above
If I'm being honest, I done been through way too much

[Pre-Chorus]
I can't fake another smile
I can't fake like I'm alright
Woo, ah (Woo, ah)
And I won't say I’m feeling fine
After what I been through, I can’t lie
Woo, ah (Woo, ah)

[Chorus]
Fuck a fake smile, smile
Fuck a fake smile, fake smile

[Verse 2]
I read the things they write about me
Hear what they're sayin’ on the TV, it's crazy
It's gettin' hard for them to shock me
But every now and then, it’s shocking, don't blame me
I know it's the life that I chose
But baby, I'm grateful, I want you to know
I'm happy for the love and all of the above
If I'm being honest, I done been through way too much

[Pre-Chorus]
I can't fake another smile
I can't fake like I'm alright
Woo, ah (Woo, ah)
And I won't say I'm feeling fine
After what I been through, I can't lie
Woo, ah (Woo, ah)

[Chorus]
Fuck a fake smile, smile
Fuck a fake smile, fake smile

[Bridge]
If I'm hurt, I ain't gon' lie about it
Arms crossed with the attitude, lips pouted
If I'm mad, I ain't gon' lie about it
Neck roll with the attitude, yuh
If I'm hurt, I ain't gon' lie about it
Arms crossed with the attitude, lips pouted
If I'm mad, I ain't gon' lie about it
Neck roll with the attitude, yuh

[Pre-Chorus]
I can't fake another smile (And I can't fake)
I can't fake like I'm alright (Another smile)
Woo, ah (Woo, ah) (Ooh)
And I won't say I'm feeling fine (I'm feeling fine)
After what I been through, I can't lie
Woo, ah (Woo, ah)

[Chorus]
Fuck a fake smile, smile
Fuck a fake smile, fake smile (Yeah)

You don't listen 'cause you know everything
You don't even need dreams
Tellin' everybody, "Stay woke, don't sleep"

[Refrain: Ariana Grande]
Ah, gonna break that shit down
You don't wait, tell 'em wait another round
Ah, guess you're way above it now
And that's your way to love it now

[Pre-Chorus: Ariana Grande]
How can they tell you shit that you've been through?
They are so confused, who cares about their rationale?
If it ain't your view
That's the bottom line
Know-it-all (Know-it-all)
Give you a box of chances, every time you blow it all (Blow it all)
As if it were shade, you would just throw it all (Throw it all)
It's like you're trying not to glow at all (Glow at all)
Know-it-all (Know-it-all)

[Verse]
Tell me why you gotta look at me that way
You know what it does to me
So baby, what you tryna say? Ayy
Lately, all I want is you on top of me
You know where your hands should be
So baby, won't you come show me? Mmm
I got you, I got you dreamin' (Ahh)
You close your eyes and you're screamin' (Ahh)
Play with your mind for no reason
I know you love how I tease it (Ahh-ah)
You know that I'm playin', so don't be mistaken
You already know what I'm thinkin', boy

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, why'd you have to be so cute?
It's impossible to ignore you, woah
Why must you make me laugh so much?
It's bad enough we get along so well

[Chorus]
Just say goodnight and go
Ohh, ohh, ohh
Just say goodnight and go
Ohh, ohh, ohh
Just say goodnight and go

[Bridge]
One of these days
You'll miss your train and come stay with me
(It's always say goodnight and go)
We'll have drinks and talk about things
And any excuse to stay awake with you
And you'd sleep here, I'd sleep there
But then the heating may be down again
(At my convenience)
We'd be good, we'd be great together

[Pre-Chorus]
Why'd you have to be so cute?
It's impossible to ignore you, woah
Why must you make me laugh so much?
It's bad enough we get along so well

[Chorus]
Just say goodnight and go
Ohh, ohh, ohh
Just say goodnight and go
Ohh, ohh, ohh

[Post-Chorus]
I know how you want it, baby, just like this
Know you're thinkin' 'bout it, baby, just one kiss
While you're lookin' at 'em, baby, read my lips
I know what you want, but you can't have this

[Outro]
Ta-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da

Wanna say goodnight
Honey, say goodnight and go
Wanna say goodnight
Baby, say goodnight and go
Wanna say goodnight
Say goodnight and go

[Verse 1: Ariana Grande]
I just broke up with my ex
Now I’m out here single, I don’t really know what’s next
But I ain’t even trippin', I'ma chill and sit back
And I know they will be coming from the right
And the left, left, left
I just broke up with my ex and
You're the one I’m feeling as I'm laying on your chest
Good conversation got me holding my breath
And I don’t normally say this but goddamn
You the best, best, best

[Pre-Chorus: Ariana Grande]
And if it feels right, promise I don't mind
And if it feels right, promise I'll stay here all night

[Chorus: Ariana Grande]
Just let me lo-o-o-o-o-o-o-love you, you
Just let me lo-o-o-o-o-o-o-love you, you
Just let me lo-o-o-o-o-o-o-love you, you
Just let me lo-o-o-o-o-o-o-love you, you

[Verse 2: Ariana Grande]
As I'm laying on your chest
I'll be out here thinkin' 'bout it, boy, it's just a guess
But something just keeps telling me I'm better than the rest
And I ain't tryna rush you, but goddamn, I'm a mess, mess, mess

[Pre-Chorus: Ariana Grande]
And if it feels right, promise I don't mind
And if it feels right, promise I'll stay here all night

[Chorus: Ariana Grande]
Just let me lo-o-o-o-o-o-o-love you, you
Just let me lo-o-o-o-o-o-o-love you, you
Just let me lo-o-o-o-o-o-o-love you, you
Just let me lo-o-o-o-o-o-o-love you, you

[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]
I say "Girl, you need a hot boy"
She say "you need to stop [censored] with them thots, boy"
I say "You need a real [censored]," she said, "Yes, Lord"
And what you need your ex for? I'm triple X, Lord
Okay, Ariana my lil mama, goodbye to the good girl
My ex tripping, it's no Biggie, I 2Pac shook her
I'm laid up with my new thing, she lay her head on my new chain
Then the mood change, my name change from 'Lil Wayne' to 'Ooh, Wayne,' oh Lord
She grinding on this Grande, oh Lord
I'm drowning, I'm gonna need that coast guard
And when it comes to that [censored], I give her amnesia
She just looking for love, she says she single and I'm her feature
Oh, my God

[Chorus: Ariana Grande & Lil Wayne]
(You're no good, but it's time I love you, baby)
Just let me lo-o-o-o-o-o-o-love you, you
Tunechi, Mula baby
Just let me lo-o-o-o-o-o-o-love you, you
(But it's time I love you, yeah, yeah, ah)
Just let me lo-o-o-o-o-o-o-love you, you
She's looking for love
(I'm looking for love)
Just let me lo-o-o-o-o-o-o-love you, you
She's looking for love
(You're looking for love baby)
Just let me lo-o-o-o-o-o-o-love you, you
She's looking for love
Just let me lo-o-o-o-o-o-o-love you, you
(I'm looking for love babe)
She's just looking for love
She's just looking for love

[Outro: Lil Wayne & Ariana Grande]
I'ma give her that love
He gon' gimme that love
She's just looking for love
Boy, I'm looking for love, baby
I'ma give her that love
I'ma give her that...
I'ma give her that...

[Verse 1]
Don't you know I'm no good for you?
I've learned to lose you, can't afford to
Tore my shirt to stop you bleedin'
But nothin' ever stops you leavin'

[Chorus]
Quiet when I'm coming home and I'm on my own
I could lie, say I like it like that, like it like that
I could lie, say I like it like that, like it like that

[Verse 2]
Don't you know too much already?
I'll only hurt you if you let me
Call me friend, but keep me closer (Call me back)
And I'll call you when the party's over

[Chorus]
Quiet when I'm coming home and I'm on my own
And I could lie, say I like it like that, like it like that
Yeah, I could lie, say I like it like that, like it like that

[Bridge]
But nothin' is better sometimes
Once we've both said our goodbyes
Let's just let it go
Let me let you go

[Chorus]
Quiet when I'm coming home and I'm on my own
I could lie, say I like it like that, like it like that
I could lie, say I like it like that, like it like that

[Verse 1]
White shirt now red, my bloody nose
Sleepin', you're on your tippy toes
Creepin' around like no one knows
Think you're so criminal
Bruises on both my knees for you
Don't say thank you or please
I do what I want when I'm wanting to
My soul? So cynical

[Chorus]
So you're a tough guy
Like it really rough guy
Just can't get enough guy
Chest always so puffed guy
I'm that bad type
Make your mama sad type
Make your girlfriend mad tight
Might seduce your dad type
I'm the bad guy
Duh

[Post-Chorus]
I'm the bad guy

[Verse 2]
I like it when you take control
Even if you know that you don't
Own me, I'll let you play the role
I'll be your animal
My mommy likes to sing along with me
But she won't sing this song
If she reads all the lyrics
She'll pity the men I know

[Chorus]
So you're a tough guy
Like it really rough guy
Just can't get enough guy
Chest always so puffed guy
I'm that bad type
Make your mama sad type
Make your girlfriend mad tight
Might seduce your dad type
I'm the bad guy
Duh

[Post-Chorus]
I'm the bad guy, duh
I'm only good at bein' bad, bad

[Bridge]
I like when you get mad
I guess I'm pretty glad that you're alone
You said she's scared of me?
I mean, I don't see what she sees
But maybe it's 'cause I'm wearing your cologne

[Outro]
I'm a bad guy
I'm, I'm a bad guy
Bad guy, bad guy
I'm a bad

[Verse 1]
Don't be that way
Fall apart twice a day
I just wish you could feel what you say
Show, never tell
But I know you too well
Got a mood that you wish you could sell

[Chorus]
If teardrops could be bottled
There'd be swimming pools filled by models
Told "a tight dress is what makes you a whore"
If "I love you" was a promise
Would you break it, if you're honest?
Tell the mirror what you know she's heard before
I don't wanna be you...
Anymore

[Verse 2]
Hands getting cold
Losing feeling is getting old
Was I made from a broken mold?
Hurt, I can't shake
We've made every mistake
Only you know the way that I break

[Chorus]
If teardrops could be bottled
There'd be swimming pools filled by models
Told "a tight dress is what makes you a whore"
If "I love you" was a promise
Would you break it, if you're honest?
Tell the mirror what you know she's heard before
I-I don't wanna be you
I don't wanna be you
I don't wanna be you...
Anymore

[Intro: Mehki Raine]
Billie

[Chorus: Billie Eilish]
What do you want from me? Why don't you run from me?
What are you wondering? What do you know?
Why aren't you scared of me? Why do you care for me?
When we all fall asleep, where do we go?

[Verse 1: Billie Eilish & Mehki Raine]
Come here
Say it, spit it out, what is it exactly
You're payin'? Is the amount cleanin' you out? Am I satisfactory?
Today, I'm thinkin' about the things that are deadly
The way I'm drinkin' you down
Like I wanna drown, like I wanna end me

[Refrain: Billie Eilish]
Step on the glass, staple your tongue (Ahh)
Bury a friend, try to wake up (Ah-ahh)
Cannibal class, killing the son (Ahh)
Bury a friend, I wanna end me

[Pre-Chorus: Billie Eilish]
I wanna end me
I wanna, I wanna, I wanna… end me
I wanna, I wanna, I wanna…

[Chorus: Billie Eilish]
What do you want from me? Why don't you run from me?
What are you wondering? What do you know?
Why aren't you scared of me? Why do you care for me?
When we all fall asleep, where do we go?

[Verse 2: Billie Eilish & Mehki Raine]
Listen
Keep you in the dark, what had you expected?
Me to make you my art and make you a star
And get you connected?
I'll meet you in the park, I'll be calm and collected
But we knew right from the start that you'd fall apart
'Cause I'm too expensive
It's probably somethin' that shouldn't be said out loud
Honestly, I thought that I would be dead by now (Wow)
Calling security, keepin' my head held down
Bury the hatchet or bury a friend right now

[Bridge: Billie Eilish & Mehki Raine]
The debt I owe, gotta sell my soul
'Cause I can't say no, no, I can't say no
Then my limbs all froze and my eyes won't close
And I can't say no, I can't say no
Careful

[Refrain: Billie Eilish]
Step on the glass, staple your tongue (Ahh)
Bury a friend, try to wake up (Ah-ahh)
Cannibal class, killing the son (Ahh)
Bury a friend, I wanna end me

[Pre-Chorus: Billie Eilish]
I wanna end me
I wanna, I wanna, I wanna… end me
I wanna, I wanna, I wanna…

[Chorus: Billie Eilish]
What do you want from me? Why don't you run from me?
What are you wondering? What do you know?
Why aren't you scared of me? Why do you care for me?
When we all fall asleep, where do we go?

[Verse 1]
It's not true
Tell me I’ve been lied to
Crying isn't like you, ooh
What the hell did I do?
Never been the type to
Let someone see right through, ooh

[Chorus]
Maybe won't you take it back?
Say you were tryna make me laugh
And nothing has to change today
You didn’t mean to say "I love you"
I love you and I don't want to, ooh

[Verse 2]
Up all night on another red-eye
I wish we never learned to fly
Maybe we should just try
To tell ourselves a good lie
Didn't mean to make you cry

[Chorus]
Maybe won't you take it back?
Say you were tryna make me laugh
And nothing has to change today
You didn't mean to say "I love you"
I love you and I don't want to, ooh

[Bridge]
The smile that you gave me
Even when you felt like dying

[Outro]
We fall apart as it gets dark
I'm in your arms in Central Park
There's nothing you could do or say
I can’t escape the way I love you
I don’t want to, but I love you, ooh
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh

[Verse 1]
"Baby, I don't feel so good," six words you never understood
"I'll never let you go," five words you'll never say (Aww)
I laugh along like nothing's wrong, four days has never felt so long
If three's a crowd and two was us, one slipped away (Hahahahahahahaha)

[Chorus]
I just wanna make you feel okay
But all you do is look the other way
I can't tell you how much I wish I didn't wanna stay
I just kinda wish you were gay

[Verse 2]
Is there a reason we're not through?
Is there a 12 step just for you?
Our conversation's all in blue
11 "heys" (Hey, hey, hey, hey)
Ten fingers tearin' out my hair
Nine times you never made it there
I ate alone at 7, you were six minutes away
(Yay)

[Chorus]
How am I supposed to make you feel okay
When all you do is walk the other way?
I can't tell you how much I wish I didn't wanna stay
I just kinda wish you were gay

[Bridge]
To spare my pride
To give your lack of interest an explanation
Don't say I'm not your type
Just say that I'm not your preferred sexual orientation
I'm so selfish
But you make me feel helpless, yeah
And I can't stand another day
Stand another day

[Chorus]
I just wanna make you feel okay
But all you do is look the other way, hmm
I can't tell you how much I wish I didn't wanna stay
I just kinda wish you were gay
I just kinda wish you were gay
I just kinda wish you were gay

[Verse 1]
I've been watchin' you for some time
Can't stop starin' at those ocean eyes
Burning cities and napalm skies
Fifteen flares inside those ocean eyes
Your ocean eyes

[Chorus]
No fair
You really know how to make me cry
When you give me those ocean eyes
I'm scared
I've never fallen from quite this high
Fallin' into your ocean eyes
Those ocean eyes

[Verse 2]
I've been walkin' through a world gone blind
Can't stop thinkin' of your diamond mind
Careful creature made friends with time
He left her lonely with a diamond mind
And those ocean eyes

[Chorus]
No fair (No fair)
You really know how to make me cry
When you give me those ocean eyes (Those ocean eyes)
I'm scared (I'm scared)
I've never fallen from quite this high
Fallin' into your ocean eyes
Those ocean eyes

[Bridge]
(Seye naeco esoht)
(Seye naeco ruoy otni 'nillaf)
Da-da-da-da-da, da-da-da-da-da (Hgih siht etiuq morf nellaf reven ev'i)
(Deracs m'i) Da-da-da-da-da-da
Da-da-da (Seye naeco esoht em evig uoy nehw)
Mmm (Yrc em ekam ot woh wonk yllaer uoy)
Mmm (Riaf on)

[Chorus]
No fair
You really know how to make me cry
When you give me those ocean eyes
I'm scared
I've never fallen from quite this high
Fallin' into your ocean eyes
Those ocean eyes

[Verse 1]
Bite my tongue, bide my time
Wearing a warning sign
Wait 'til the world is mine
Visions I vandalize
Cold in my kingdom size
Fell for these ocean eyes

[Chorus]
You should see me in a crown
I'm gonna run this nothing town
Watch me make 'em bow
One by one by one
One by one by
You should see me in a crown
Your silence is my favorite sound
Watch me make 'em bow
One by one by one
One by one by one

[Verse 2]
Count my cards, watch them fall
Blood on a marble wall
I like the way they all scream
Tell me which one is worse
Living or dying first
Sleeping inside a hearse (I don't dream)

[Bridge]
You say, "Come over, baby
I think you're pretty"
I'm okay, I'm not your baby
If you think I'm pretty

[Chorus]
You should see me in a crown
I'm gonna run this nothing town
Watch me make 'em bow
One by one by one
One by one by
You should see me in a crown
Your silence is my favorite sound
Watch me make 'em bow
One by one by one
One by one by one

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
Crown
I'm gonna run this nothing town
Watch me make 'em bow
One by one by one
One by one by
You should see me in a crown (You should see me, see me)
Your silence is my favorite sound (You should see me, see me)
Watch me make 'em bow
One by one by one
One by one by one

[Intro]
Mind
Mind

[Verse 1]
Sittin' all alone
Mouth full of gum
In the driveway
My friends aren't far
In the back of my car
Lay their bodies

[Pre-Chorus]
Where's my mind?
Where's my mind?

[Verse 2]
They'll be here pretty soon
Lookin' through my room
For the money
I'm bitin' my nails
I'm too young to go to jail
It's kinda funny

[Pre-Chorus]
Where's my mind?
Where's my mind?
Where's my mind?
Where's my mind?

[Chorus]
Maybe it's in the gutter
Where I left my lover
What an expensive fake
My V is for Vendetta
Thought that I'd feel better
But now I got a bellyache
(Mind)

[Verse 3]
Everything I do
The way I wear my noose
Like a necklace
I wanna make 'em scared
Like I could be anywhere
Like I'm reckless

[Pre-Chorus]
I lost my mind
I don't mind
Where's my mind?
Where's my mind?

[Chorus]
Maybe it's in the gutter
Where I left my lover
What an expensive fake
My V is for Vendetta
Thought that I'd feel better
But now I got a bellyache
(Bellyache, bellyache, bellyache, bellyache
Bellyache, bellyache)
Maybe it's in the gutter
Where I left my lover
What an expensive fake
My V is for Vendetta
Thought that I'd feel better
But now I got a bellyache

[Intro]
My Lucifer is lonely

[Verse 1]
Standing there, killing time
Can't commit to anything but a crime
Peter's on vacation, an open invitation
Animals, evidence
Pearly Gates look more like a picket fence
Once you get inside 'em
Got friends but can't invite them

[Pre-Chorus]
Hills burn in California
My turn to ignore ya
Don't say I didn't warn ya

[Chorus]
All the good girls go to Hell
'Cause even God herself has enemies
And once the water starts to rise
And Heaven's out of sight
She'll want the Devil on her team

[Post-Chorus]
My Lucifer is lonely

[Verse 2]
Look at you needing me
You know I'm not your friend without some greenery
Walk in wearin' fetters
Peter should know better
Your cover up is caving in
Man is such a fool, why are we saving him?
Poisoning themselves now
Begging for our help, wow

[Pre-Chorus]
Hills burn in California
My turn to ignore ya
Don't say I didn't warn ya

[Chorus]
All the good girls go to Hell (All the good girls go to Hell)
'Cause even God herself (God herself) has enemies
And once the water starts to rise (Water starts to rise)
And Heaven's out of sight
She'll want the Devil on her team

[Post-Chorus]
My Lucifer is lonely
There's nothing left to save now
My god is gonna owe me
There's nothing left to save now

[Outro]
Haha!
I cannot do the snowflake

[Verse 1]
Don't be cautious, don't be kind
You committed, I'm your crime
Push my button anytime
You got your finger on the trigger, but your trigger finger's mine

[Verse 2]
Silver dollar, golden flame
Dirty water, poison rain
Perfect murder, take your aim
I don't belong to anyone, but everybody knows my name

[Pre-Chorus]
By the way, you've been uninvited
'Cause all you say are all the same things I did

[Chorus]
Copycat tryna cop my manner
Watch your back when you can't watch mine
Copycat tryna cop my glamour
Why so sad, bunny? Can't have mine

[Verse 3]
Call me calloused, call me cold
You're italic, I'm in bold
Call me cocky, watch your tone
You better love me, 'cause you're just a clone

[Pre-Chorus]
By the way, you've been uninvited
'Cause all you say are all the same things I did

[Chorus]
Copycat tryna cop my manner
Watch your back when you can't watch mine
Copycat tryna cop my glamour
Why so sad, bunny? Can't have mine

[Bridge]
Mine
I would hate to see you go
Hate to be the one that told you so
You just crossed the line
You've run out of time
I'm so sorry, now you know
Sorry I'm the one that told you so
Sorry, sorry, I'm sorry, sorry
Psych

[Pre-Chorus]
By the way, you've been uninvited
'Cause all you say are all the same things I did

[Chorus]
Copycat tryna cop my manner
Watch your back when you can't watch mine
Copycat tryna cop my glamour
Why so sad, bunny? Can't have mine

[Verse 1]
What is it about them?
I must be missing something
They just keep doing nothing
Too intoxicated to be scared
Better off without them
They're nothing but unstable
Bring ashtrays to the table
And that's about the only thing they share

[Chorus]
I'm in their secondhand smoke
Still just drinking canned Coke
I don't need a Xanny to feel better
On designated drives home
Only one who's not stoned
Don't give me a Xanny, now or ever

[Interlude]
Can you check your Uber rating? Oh my god
(And it's like, wait, like, when?)

[Verse 2]
Wakin' up at sundown (Ooh)
They're late to every party (Ooh)
Nobody's ever sorry (Ooh)
Too inebriated now to dance
Morning as they come down (Come down)
Their pretty heads are hurting (Hurting)
They're awfully bad at learning (Learning)
Make the same mistakes, blame circumstance

[Chorus]
I'm in their secondhand smoke
Still just drinking canned Coke
I don't need a Xanny to feel better
On designated drives home
Only one who's not stoned
Don't give me a Xanny, now or ever

[Bridge]
Please don't try to kiss me on the sidewalk
On your cigarette break
I can't afford to love someone
Who isn't dying by mistake in Silver Lake

[Outro]
What is it about them?
I must be missing something
They just keep doin' nothing
Too intoxicated to be scared
Hmm, hmm
Hmm, mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm
Come down
Hurting
Learning

[Intro]
No, Billy, I haven't done that dance since my wife died
There’s a whole crowd of people out there who need to learn how to do The Scarn

[Verse 1]
Don't ask questions you don't wanna know
Learned my lesson way too long ago
To be talkin’ to you, belladonna
Shoulda taken a break, not an Oxford comma
Take what I want when I wanna
And I want ya

[Pre-Chorus]
Bad, bad news
One of us is gonna lose
I'm the powder, you're the fuse
Just add some friction

[Chorus]
You are my strange addiction
You are my strange addiction
My doctors can't explain
My symptoms or my pain
But you are my strange addiction

[Interlude]
I'm really, really sorry, I think I was just relieved
To see that Michael Scarn got his confidence back
Yeah, Michael, the movie is amazing
It's like, one of the best movies I've ever seen in my life

[Verse 2]
Deadly fever, please don't ever break
Be my reliever ’cause I don’t self medicate
And it burns like a gin and I like it
Put your lips on my skin and you might ignite it
Hurts, but I know how to hide it, kinda like it (Teh)

[Pre-Chorus]
Bad, bad news
One of us is gonna lose
I'm the powder, you’re the fuse
Just add some friction

[Chorus]
You are my strange addiction
You are my strange addiction
My doctors can't explain
My symptoms or my pain
But you are my strange addiction

[Bridge]
Bite my glass, set myself on fire
Can't you tell I'm crass? Can’t you tell I'm wired?
Tell me nothing lasts, like I don't know
You could kiss my— asking about my motto

[Interlude]
You should enter it in festivals or carnivals
Thoughts? Pretty good reaction
Pretty cool... right?

[Chorus]
You are my strange addiction
You are my strange addiction
My doctors can't explain
My symptoms or my pain
But you are my strange addiction

[Outro]
Did you like it? Did you like that?
Um, which part?

[Verse 1]
Take me to the rooftop
I wanna see the world when I stop breathing
Turnin' blue
Tell me love is endless, don't be so pretentious
Leave me like you do (Like you do)

[Pre-Chorus]
If you need me, wanna see me
Better hurry 'cause I'm leavin' soon

[Chorus]
Sorry can't save me now
Sorry I don't know how
Sorry there's no way out (Sorry)
But down
Hmm, down

[Verse 2]
Taste me, the salty tears on my cheek
That's what a year-long headache does to you
I'm not okay, I feel so scattered
Don't say I'm all that matters
Leave me, déjà vu (Hmm)

[Pre-Chorus]
If you need me, wanna see me
You better hurry, I'm leavin' soon

[Chorus]
Sorry can't save me now (Sorry)
Sorry I don't know how (Sorry)
Sorry there's no way out (Sorry)
But down
Hmm, down

[Outro]
Call my friends and tell them that I love them
And I'll miss them
But I'm not sorry
Call my friends and tell them that I love them
And I'll miss them
Sorry

[Verse 1]
Lips meet teeth and tongue
My heart skips eight beats at once
If we were meant to be, we would have been by now
See what you wanna see, but all I see is him right now

[Chorus]
I'll sit and watch your car burn
With the fire that you started in me
But you never came back to ask it out
Go ahead and watch my heart burn
With the fire that you started in me
But I'll never let you back to put it out

[Verse 2]
Your love feels so fake
And my demands aren't high to make
If I could get to sleep, I would have slept by now
Your lies will never keep, I think you need to blow 'em out

[Chorus]
I'll sit and watch your car burn
With the fire that you started in me
But you never came back to ask it out
Go ahead and watch my heart burn
With the fire that you started in me
But I'll never let you back to put it out

[Bridge]
When you call my name
Do you think I'll come runnin'?
You never did the same
So good at givin' me nothin'
When you close your eyes, do you picture me?
When you fantasize, am I your fantasy?
Now you know
Now I'm free

[Chorus]
I'll sit and watch your car burn
With the fire that you started in me
But you never came back to ask it out
Watch my heart burn
With the fire that you started in me
But I'll never let you back to put it out

[Outro]
Never let you back
Let you back, let you back
Never gonna let you back
Let you back

[Verse 1]
Told you not to worry
But maybe that's a lie
Honey, what's your hurry?
Won't you stay inside?
Remember not to get too close to stars
They're never gonna give you love like ours

[Chorus]
Where did you go?
I should know, but it's cold
And I don't wanna be lonely
So show me the way home
I can't lose another life

[Refrain]
Hurry, I'm worried

[Verse 2]
The world's a little blurry
Or maybe it's my eyes
The friends I've had to bury
They keep me up at night
Said I couldn't love someone
'Cause I might break
If you're gonna die, not by mistake

[Chorus]
So, where did you go?
I should know, but it's cold
And I don't wanna be lonely
So tell me you'll come home
Even if it's just a lie

[Bridge]
I tried not to upset you
Let you rescue me the day I met you
I just wanted to protect you
But now I'll never get to

[Refrain]
Hurry, I'm worried

[Outro]
Where did you go?
I should know, but it's cold
And I don't wanna be lonely
Was hoping you'd come home
I don't care if it's a lie

[Intro]
(Three and four and)
Ba-ba-da, ba-ba-da-ba-da
Mmm, mmm

[Verse 1]
My boy's bein' sus, he was shady enough
But now he's just a shadow
My boy loves his friends like I love my split ends
And by that, I mean he cuts 'em off
(What?)

[Chorus]
My boy, my boy, my boy
Don't love me like he promised
My boy, my boy, my boy
He ain't a man and sure as hell ain't honest

[Verse 2]
My boy's bein' sus and he don't know how to cuss
He just sounds like he's tryna be his father (Who are you?)
My boy's an ugly crier but he's such a pretty liar
And by that, I mean he said he'd change

[Chorus]
My boy, my boy, my boy
Don't love me like he promised
My boy, my boy, my boy
He ain't a man and sure as hell ain't honest

[Bridge]
My boy, my-my boy, my friends
I love-love, I-I love-love my split ends
My boy (Love, love, love, love, love, love)
My-my boy (Love, love, love, love, love, love)
My boy, my (Love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love)
(Alright, dude, go trip over a knife)

[Chorus]
My boy, my boy, my boy
Don't love me like he promised
My boy, my boy, my boy
He ain't a man and sure as hell ain't honest

[Outro]
You want me to be yours? Well, then you gotta be mine
And if you want a good girl, then goodbye
You want me to be yours? Well, then you gotta be mine
And if you want a good girl, then goodbye

[Verse 1]
Help, I lost myself again
But I remember you
Don't come back
It won't end well
But I wish you'd tell me to

[Chorus]
Our love is six feet under
I can't help but wonder
If our grave was watered by the rain
Would roses bloom?
Could roses bloom
Again?

[Verse 2]
Retrace my lips
Erase your touch
It's all too much for me
Blow away
Like smoke in air
How can you die carelessly?

[Chorus]
Our love is six feet under
I can't help but wonder
If our grave was watered by the rain
Would roses bloom?
Could roses bloom?

[Bridge]
They're playin' our sound
Layin' us down tonight
And all of these clouds
Crying us back to life
But you're cold as a night

[Chorus]
Six feet under
I can't help but wonder
If our grave was watered by the rain
Bloom
Bloom
Again

[Outro]
Help, I lost myself again
But I remember you

[Verse 1]
So you're still thinking of me
Just like I know you should
I can not give you everything, you know I wish I could
I'm so high at the moment
I'm so caught up in this
Yeah, we're just young, dumb and broke
But we still got love to give

[Chorus]
While we're young dumb
Young, young dumb and broke
Young dumb
Young, young dumb and broke
Young dumb
Young dumb
Young, young dumb and broke
Young dumb broke high school kids
Yadadadadadadada
Yadadadadadada
Yadadadadadadada
Young dumb broke high school kids

[Verse 2]
We have so much in common
We argue all the time
You always say I'm wrong
I'm pretty sure I'm right
What's fun about commitment?
When we have our life to live
Yeah, we're just young dumb and broke
But we still got love to give

[Chorus]
While we're young dumb
Young, young dumb and broke
Young dumb
Young, young dumb and broke
Young dumb
Young, young dumb and broke
Young dumb broke high school kids
Yadadadadadadada
Yadadadadadada
Yadadadadadadada
Young dumb broke high school kids

[Bridge]
Jump and we think - do it all in the name of love
Love
Run into sin, do it all in the name of fun
Fun
Whoa-oa-oa
I'm so high at the moment
I'm so caught up in this
Yeah, we're just young, dumb and broke
But we still got love to give

[Chorus]
While we're young dumb
Young, young dumb and broke
Young dumb
Young, young dumb and broke
Young dumb
Young dumb
Young, young dumb and broke
Young dumb broke high school kids
Yadadadadadadada
Yadadadadadada
Yadadadadadadada
Young dumb broke high school kids

[Chorus]
Send me your location, let's
Focus on communicating
'Cause I just need the time and place to come through (place to come through)
Send me your location
Let's ride the vibrations
I don't need nothing else but you
(do not need nothing else but you)

[Verse 1]
At times I wonder why I fool with you
But this is new to me, this is new to you
Initially, I didn't wanna fall for you
Gather my attention it was all for you, so don't
Take advantage, don't leave my heart damaged
I understand that things go a little bit better when you plan it... oh, so won't

[Chorus]
Send me your location, let's
Focus on communicating
'Cause I just need the time and place to come through
Send me your location
Let's ride the vibrations
I don't need nothing else but you
(I don't need nothing else but you)

[Verse 2]
I don't wanna fall in love off of subtweets, so
Let's get personal
I got a lot of cool spots that we can go
Tell me what's the move and I got you
I'm only acting like this 'cause I like you
Just give me the vibe to slide in
Oh, I might make you mine by the night, and

[Chorus]
Send me your location, let's
Focus on communicating
'Cause I just need the time and place to come through (place to come through)
Send me your location
Let's ride the vibrations
I don't need nothing else but you
(I don't need nothing else but you)

[Outro]
Ride, ride, ride, come and vibe with me tonight
I don't need nothing else but you
(I don't need nothing else but you)
Ride, ride, ride, come and vibe with me tonight
I don't need nothing else but you
Nothing else but you
Do, do, do, do, do, do
Oh, oh, mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, mmm, mmm, mmm
Do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do
Do, do, do, do, do, do, do
I don't need nothing else but you

[Intro]
Better
Nothing, baby
Nothing feels better
I'm not really drunk, I never get that fucked up
I'm not, I'm so sober

[Verse 1]
Love to see you shine in the night like the diamond you are
(Love to see you shine in the night like the diamond you are)
I'm good on the side, it's alright, just hold me in the dark
(I'm good on the side, it's alright, just hold me in the dark)
No one's gotta know what we do, hit me up when you're bored
(No one's gotta know what we do, hit me up when you're bored)
'Cause I live down the street
So we meet when you need and it's yours
All I hear is...

[Chorus]
Nothing feels better than this
Nothing feels better
Nothing feels better than this
Nothing feels better, oh no
We don't gotta hide, this is what you like
I'll admit
Nothing feels better than this

[Verse 2]
You say we're just friends but I swear when nobody's around
(You say we're just friends but I swear when nobody's around)
You keep my hand around your neck, we connect, are you feeling it now?
(You keep my hand around your neck, we connect, are you feeling it now?)
'Cause I am
I got so high the other night, I swear to God, felt my feet lift the ground
(I got so high the other night, I swear to God I felt my feet lift the ground)
Ooh, yeah
Your back against the wall, this is all you've been talking about
In my ears

[Chorus]
Nothing feels better than this
Nothing feels better
Nothing feels better than this
Nothing feels better, oh no
We don't gotta hide, this is what you like
I admit
Nothing feels better than this

[Bridge]
Now, left, right, left, right
Take it back, bring it side to side
Like that, like that, ayy
Ooh, now, left, right, left, right
Take it back, bring it side to side
Like

[Chorus]
Nothing feels better than this
Nothing feels better
Nothing feels better than this
Nothing feels better, oh no
We don't gotta hide, this is what you like
I admit
Nothing feels better than this (Better than this)

[Outro]
Nothing feels better than this

[Intro]
2, 3, 4

[Verse 1]
The hard part always seems to last forever
Sometimes I forget that we aren't together
Deep down in my heart, I hope you're doing alright
But from time to time I often think of why you aren't mine

[Chorus]
But I'll keep your number saved
'Cause I hope one day you'll get the sense to call me
I'm hoping that you'll say
You're missing me the way I'm missing you
So I'll keep your number saved
'Cause I hope one day I'll get the pride to call you
To tell you that no one else
Is gonna hold you down the way that I do

[Verse 2]
Now, I can't say I'll be alright without you
And I can't say that I haven't tried to
But, all your stuff is gone
I erased all the pictures from my phone
Of me and you
Here's what I'll do

[Chorus]
I'll keep your number saved
'Cause I hope one day you'll get the sense to call me
I'm hoping that you'll say
You're missing me the way I'm missing you
So I'll keep your number saved
'Cause I hope one day I'll get the pride to call you
To tell you that no one else
Is gonna hold you down the way that I do

[Bridge]
I hope you think of all the times we shared
I hope you'll finally realize I was the only one who cared
It's crazy how this love thing seems unfair
You won't find a love like mine anywhere

[Chorus]
But I'll keep your number saved
'Cause I hope one day you'll get the sense to call me
I'm hoping that you'll say
You're missing me the way I'm missing you
So I'll keep your number saved
'Cause I hope one day I'll get the pride to call you
To tell you that no one else
Is gonna hold you down the way that I do
But I'll keep your number saved
'Cause I hope one day you'll get the sense to call me
I'm hoping that you'll say
You're missing me the way I'm missing you
So I'll keep your number saved
'Cause I hope one day I'll get the pride to call you
To tell you that I'm finally over you
I'm finally over you

[Chorus]
Can we just talk? Can we just talk?
Talk about where we're goin'
Before we get lost, lend me your thoughts
Can't get what we want without knowin'
I've never felt like this before
I apologize if I'm movin' too far
Can we just talk? Can we just talk?
Figure out where we're goin'

[Verse 1]
Yeah, started off right
I can see it in your eyes
I can tell that you're wantin' more
What's been on your mind?
There's no reason we should hide
Tell me somethin' I ain't heard before

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, I've been dreamin' 'bout it
And it's you I'm on
So stop thinkin' 'bout it

[Chorus]
Can we just talk? Can we just talk?
Talk about where we're goin'
Before we get lost, lend me your thoughts (Yeah)
Can't get what we want without knowin' (No)
I've never felt like this before
I apologize if I'm movin' too far
Can we just talk? Can we just talk?
Figure out where we're goin'

[Verse 2]
Oh, nah
Penthouse view, left some flowers in the room
I'll make sure I leave the door unlocked
Now I'm on the way, swear I won't be late
I'll be there by five o'clock

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, you've been dreamin' 'bout it
And I'm what you want
So stop thinkin' 'bout it

[Chorus]
Can we just talk? (Oh) Can we just talk?
Talk about where we're goin'
Before we get lost, lend me your thoughts
Can't get what we want without knowin'
I've never felt like this before
I apologize if I'm movin' too far
Can we just talk? Can we just talk?
Figure out where we're goin'

[Outro]
Figure out where we're goin'

[Verse 1]
As time passes, I feel so low
Searchin' for pieces, covering up the hole
I'll fight for your love, I'll fight for your soul
I'll throw all of my cares away for you
I'll be there to wait for you
Maybe you weren't the one for me
But deep down I wanted you to be
I'll still see you in my dreams
All the things that I did for you, just wasn't it for you

[Chorus]
So I'll be coasting, roller-coasting
Through my emotion
I will be coasting, roller-coasting
I'm hoping that you'll come back to me

[Verse 2]
Moving on seems harder to do
When the one that you love moves faster than you
I gave you my all, I showed the proof of your lies
And you weren't worth it, you don't deserve me
As time passes I'm feeling high
You're not the one I'm thinking of tonight
I may not be over you, but I'll try inside
I'm feeling better now, finally feeling special now, oh

[Chorus]
Coasting, roller-coasting
In my emotions, oh
I'll be coasting, roller-coasting
I noticed you weren't the one for me

[Outro]
You weren't the one for me
You weren't the one for me
You weren't the one for me
You weren't the one for me
Weren't the one for me
You weren't the one
You weren't the one for me
So don't come back to me, no
No, don't come back to me, no
No, don't come back to me
No, don't come back to me, no
No, don't come back to me
You weren't the one for me
You weren't the one for me
You weren't the one for me
You weren't the one for me

[Intro: Khalid]
Na, na, na, na, ooh
Oh, no, oh, ayy

[Chorus: Khalid]

Come outside, looking like a snack, hurry up, get in, hell yeah (yeah)
Come with me on this mission (ooh yeah, ooh yeah)
Riding down the coast (ooh yeah), I want that for sure (ooh yeah)
You say, "Play Khalid" (ooh yeah)
I say, "Pass the weed" (ooh yeah)
Pull up to the crib, oh, said you've never been before
Put you in Provocateur, girl, I made you mi amor
You said you left your ex, that dude was always gassin'
You said before me, you ain't never been this happy

You hit my phone, I'm on my way, I cancel plans, yeah, yeah

[Chorus: Khalid]
Put it in drive, I'll be outside, I'll be on the way

[Verse 3: 6LACK]
You tryna make a move
Tonight I got the time, tell me what you wanna do
Call the squad if you wanna rendezvous
They gon' push up on they own, I only got room for two
From the 'jects on the set, it's a Porsche, not a 'Vette
I confess, I'ma flex till they show some respect
Get away so we can make sense of your life
You was in park but I just put your shit in drive
Now coast like there's no tomorrow
Moving too fast, I'm open to drive slow (yeah)
I don't want you to wonder where I go
Can learn a lot from this and that's something that I know

[Chorus: Khalid]
Put it in drive, I'll be outside, I'll be on the way
I'll be on the way
You can meet me in five, I'll be all night, I'll be all day
I'll be all day
Put it in drive, I'll be outside, I'll be on the way
I'll be on the way
You can meet me in five, I'll be all night, I'll be all day
I'll be all day

[Intro]
Yeah!
Ha
Yeah!
Ha

[Verse 1]
Woke up a little too late this morning
But I think I'll be okay
I'll be okay
Damn, my car still smells like marijuana
My mom is gonna kill me
Gonna kill me
Traffic's backed up from corner to corner
So I guess I'll hit the highway
The highway
Shake away all the stress off my shoulders
Gonna have a good day
A good day

[Chorus]
Because I'm eighteen
And I still live with my parents
Yeah they're not like yours
Well yours are more understanding
I've never fell in love
I saved those feelings for you
So let's do all the stupid shit that young kids do
It’s me and you, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
You, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Just me and you, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Let's do all the stupid shit that young kids do

[Verse 2]
No I've never really been the smartest
Yeah I've made my mistakes
My mistakes
You were there when times were at their darkest
Always showing me the way
Lead the way
Your love seems to cut me deep, the sharpest
You'll always have a part of me
A part of me
Losing you has always been the hardest
I wish it were the old days (oh I wish it were the old days)

[Chorus]
'Cause I was eighteen
And I still lived with my parents
Yeah they're not like yours
Well yours were more understanding
I never fell in love
I saved those feelings for you
When we did all the stupid shit that young kids do
Just me and you, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
You, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Just me and you, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Let's do all the stupid shit that young kids do

[Bridge]
It's me and you
You
You, ooh, ooh, ooh
You
Just me and you
You
You, ooh, ooh, ooh
Hey…hey

[Chorus]
Because I'm eighteen
And I still live with my parents
Yeah they're not like yours
Well yours are more understanding
I've never fell in love
I saved those feelings for you
So let's do all the stupid shit that young kids do
It’s me and you, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
It's me and you, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Just me and you, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Let's do all the stupid shit that young kids do

[Outro]
It's me and you, ooh, ooh
Noooo....
Just me and you, ooh, ooh

[Verse 1]
Saturday nights, blueberry cigarillos
Swishers make my throat hurt
Rolling OCB's on the side for me
Light 'em up and let 'em both burn
Family feuds, say your mom's confused
Off of shit she doesn't wanna learn
But daddy's gone, say he's never home
And wishing only makes it worse

[Pre-Chorus]
I guess there's certain dreams that you gotta keep
'Cause they'll only know what you let 'em see

[Chorus]
All the things that I know
That your parents don't
They don't care like I do
Nowhere like I do
And all the things that I know
That your parents don't
They don't care like I do
Nowhere like I do
Nowhere like I do
Nowhere like I do

[Verse 2]
Saturday nights, light gray Silverado
You drive it 'cause you have to
Stay up working late at a job you hate
Fix your makeup in a dirty bathroom
No more love, in and out of clubs
Knowing what you gotta do
You've got plans wrapped in rubber bands
And that's the only thing you'll never lose

[Pre-Chorus]
I guess there's certain dreams that you gotta keep
'Cause they'll only know what you let 'em see

[Chorus]
All the things that I know
That your parents don't
They don't care like I do
Nowhere like I do
And all the things that I know
That your parents don't
They don't care like I do
Nowhere like I do
Nowhere like I do

[Bridge]
'Cause I care, I care about you
There's nowhere I'd rather be
Than right here around you
I care, care about you
There's nowhere I'd rather be

[Chorus]
All the things that I know
That your parents don't
They don't care about you
Nowhere like I do
All the things that I know
That your parents don't
Don't care about you
Nowhere like I
Nowhere like I do (Do, do, do)
Nowhere like I do (Do, do, do)
Nowhere like I do (Do, do, do)
Nowhere like I do (Do, do, do)

[Chorus: Khalid & Empress Of]
Llévame a ciudad del sol
Llévame, llévame
Donde dejé mi corazón
Llévame, llévame
Llévamelo
Solo en la ciudad del sol
Llévame, llévame
Donde dejé mi corazón
Llévame, llévame
Llévamelo

[Verse 1: Khalid]
Two days 'til I'm back on the road and I'm wanting you
I hear you calling me, so come onto me tonight
No time to be worried about what we wanna do
Just take care of me, I'll let you take the lead tonight

[Pre-Chorus: Khalid & Empress Of]
Feel it coming over me
Sólo así junto a ti
Don't let the city break your heart
Conmigo no tienes que llorar

[Chorus: Khalid & Empress Of]
Llévame a ciudad del sol
Llévame, llévame
Donde dejé mi corazón
Llévame, llévame
Llévamelo
Solo en la ciudad del sol
Llévame, llévame
Donde dejé mi corazón
Llévame, llévame
Llévamelo

[Verse 2: Khalid]
No room to be falling for you without honesty
Don't be scared of me
It's where you wanna be, tonight
It's alright, alright for the meantime
If I have to wait, I'll be patient, babe
Tonight

[Pre-Chorus: Khalid & Empress Of]
Sólo así junto a ti
Don't let the city break your heart (Your heart)
Conmigo no tienes que llorar

[Chorus: Khalid & Empress Of]
Llévame a ciudad del sol
Llévame, llévame
Donde dejé mi corazón
Llévame, llévame
Llévamelo
Solo en la ciudad del sol
Llévame, llévame
Donde dejé mi corazón
Llévame, llévame
Llévamelo

[Bridge: Khalid]
Wind it up slow for me, pick it up, pick it up
Wind it up slow for me, pick it up, pick it up
Wind it up slow for me, pick it up, pick it up
Wind it up slow for me, pick it up, pick it up

[Chorus: Khalid & Empress Of]
Llévame a ciudad del sol
Llévame, llévame
Donde dejé mi corazón
Llévame, llévame
Llévamelo
Solo en la ciudad del sol
Llévame, llévame
Donde dejé mi corazón
Llévame, llévame
Llévamelo

[Outro]
I-I send you a lot of, a lot of hugs
And, I hope to see you very soon

[Verse 1]
Living the good life full of goodbyes
My eyes are on the grey skies
Saying I don't want to come home tonight
Yeah, and I'm high up, off what?
I don't even remember
But my friend passed out in the Uber ride

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, I'm from the city of the 9-1-5
Where all the girls are pretty
And they're down for the hype
All my boys are with me
Going up for the night
But who cares, who cares
'Cause this is our year

[Chorus]
So wake me up in the spring
While I'm high off my American dream
We don't always say what we mean
That's the lie of an American teen

[Verse 2]
Maybe the end is near
But I've been waiting all year
To get the hell up out of here
And throw away my fears
I'm so faded (I'm so faded)
Off of all the things that I've taken, and
Maybe I'm not really drunk
Maybe I'm really good at faking

[Pre-Chorus]
From the city of the 9-1-5
Where all the girls are pretty
And they're down for the hype
All my boys are with me
Going up for the night
But who cares, who cares
'Cause this is our year

[Chorus]
So wake me up in the spring
While I'm high off my American dream
We don't always say what we mean
That's the lie of an American teen

[Bridge]
My youth is the foundation of me
Living life as an American teen (American teen)
American teen
Mmm, oh yeah
We don't always say what we mean
When we're high off our American teen
My youth is the foundation of me
Oh, I'm proud to be American


[Chorus]
So wake me up in the spring
While I'm high off my American (American dream)
And we don't always say what we mean
It's the lie of an American teen
My youth is the foundation of me
Living life as an American teen
American teen (American teen)

[Outro]
American Teenager
And I'll be living this dream with you

[Chant]
We don't always say what we mean
When we're high off our American teen
My youth is the foundation of me
Oh, I'm proud to be American

[Intro]
Something that you're doing has me falling all the way
I'm tripping off your love and all the other drugs we taking
Over all the others, you're the one all over me
I need your therapy
Need your therapy

[Verse 1]
I don't mean to come off aggressive (no)
I'm just here to pass off the message (yeah)
'Cause you were in my head when
I thought I lost my mind
But we do this every time

[Chorus]
Cause there's something that you're doing has me falling all the way
I'm tripping off your love and all the other drugs we taking
Over all the others, you're the one all over me
I need your therapy, need your therapy

[Verse 2]
I'm not one for relationships
It's over-rated
We could still be lovers
That's all I'm saying, and
Over all the others, you're the one all over me
I need your therapy
Need your therapy

[Bridge]
I'm fiendin' off, fiendin' off you
Lalalalalala
I'm needin', needin' you
Lalalalalala
I'm fiendin' off, fiendin' off you
Lalalalalala
I'm needin', needin' you
Lalalalalala

[Verse 3]
I hope I made the impression
That I was always interested
All the feelings I kept in
What should we do?
Whatever you want to

[Chorus]
'Cause there's something that you're doing has me falling all the way
I'm tripping off your love and all the other drugs we taking
Over all the others, you're the one all over me
I need your therapy, need your therapy

[Verse 4]
I'm not one for relationships
It's over-rated
We could still be lovers
That's all I'm saying, and
Over all the others, you're the one all over me
I need your therapy
Need your therapy

[Bridge]
I'm fiendin' off, fiendin' off you
Lalalalalala
I'm needin', needin' you
Lalalalalala
I'm fiendin' off, fiendin' off you
Lalalalalala
I'm needin', needin' you
Lalalalalala

[Verse 1]
I'm not the best at showing my emotions
You cut me deep and you left me wide open
I fought the demons that lie in between us
They'd think we're perfect if they'd ever seen us, but
I guess this sounds like another sad love song
I can't get over how it all went wrong
But, I let the words come together
Then, maybe I'll feel better

[Chorus]
Bridges they are burning
Lover, I am worried
Tables they are turning
Lover, I am hurting
Burning burning burning, dadadadada
Turning turning turning turning, dadadadada
Burning burning burning, dadadadada
Turning turning turning turning, dadadadada

[Verse 2]
I took the time to think of what you said
You were tap-dancing in my head
I must be honest, I have a lot of pride
But I'm broken inside
I guess this sounds like another sad love song
I can't get over how it all went wrong
But, I let the words come together
Then, maybe I'll feel better

[Chorus]
Bridges they are burning
Lover, I am worried
Tables they are turning
Lover, I am hurting
Bridges they are burning
Lover, I am worried
Tables they are turning
Lover, I am hurting
Burning burning burning, dadadadada
Turning turning turning turning, dadadadada
Burning burning burning, dadadadada
Turning turning turning turning, dadadadada
Burning burning burning, dadadadada
Turning turning turning turning, dadadadada
Burning burning burning, dadadadada
Turning turning turning turning, dadadadada
Bridges they are burning
Lover, I am worried
Tables they are turning
Lover, I am hurting
Bridges they are burning
Lover, I am worried
Tables they are turning
Lover, I am hurting

[Verse 1]
We've been here before, surrounded in the cold
You take me to places I've never known
And you push me to places I'll never go
I would die for you
Tell me the truth
Am I all that you would need?
If we're keeping it a hundred, you're all that I need for me
From the jump until forever from now, I would ride for you

[Chorus]
But you got me shot down by love
You got my heart now
Why won't you stop now?
Oh I've been knocked down by you
You got my heart now
Why won't you stop now?

[Verse 2]
I've been through it whole
I've been through the worst
But I never knew how much our love could hurt
Over my family I put you first
Writing out my feelings is the only thing that work
I don't hear from the friends I thought were mine too
But I hold on to the poems I would write you
Happy seventeen, I saw us two and you saw three
I guess our lines are structured like a haiku

[Chorus 2
You got me shot down by love
And you got my heart now
Why won't you stop now?
Oh I've been knocked down by you
And you got my heart now
Why won't you stop now?

[Bridge]
Knocked down, knocked down
Knocked down, knocked down
Knocked down
Knocked down

[Chorus]
I've been shot down by love
You got my heart now
Why won't you stop now?
I've been knocked down by you
And you got my heart now
Why won't you stop now?

[Verse 1]
I've been seeing angels
In my living room
That have walked the sun
And have slept on the moon
Covered in the fragrance
Of their own perfume
Telling me the stories
Stories coming true
Well you see these angels
These angels see the light
Yeah I had my troubles
Troubles, all right
I've been seeing angels
Oh no

[Verse 2]
They'll hold onto their secrets
And torn up memories
We float above horizons
And sail across the seas
I hope for better days
And lightly times are tough
The angels give me strength
And I'm not giving up
So I wipe away my tears
I unveil my pain
They're brushing off my shoulders
And I hold on to their stain
I've been seeing angels

[Outro]
Angels
Angels
Angels
Angels
Angels
Angels, ayy
Angels

[Verse 1]
Evade my intellect
Feed into my introspect
Wrap your words around my brain
Driving me insane, yeah, ooh
You found the real me
Save my inner being
Switch on me like seasons
Do I need to give you a reason?

[Chorus]
There's millions of reasons to love you (Love you)
There's millions of reasons (Reasons, ooh)
You give me a reason to want you (Want you)
You give me a reason
Give me a reason, give me a reason, give me a reason (Ooh, ooh, ooh)
Give me a reason, give me a reason, give me a reason (Reason)
Yeah (Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)

[Verse 2]
I know you're tired of inconsistency
Are you into me? Are you feeling me?
To be honest
I'm into you, and the way that you talk is so damn cool
With your love I'm on a different high I've never felt before
And if your love is a drug, I'm an addict 'cause, damn, I'm feening for more, yeah
We've been talking for a minute now
Let me know where your heads at, am I in it? Yeah
You put me on your super high
I want to get lost in your paradise

[Chorus]
There's millions of reasons to love you (Love you)
There's millions of reasons (Reasons, ooh, ooh, ooh)
You give me a reason to want you (Want you)
You give me a reason (Yeah, yeah, ooh)
Give me a reason, give me a reason, give me a reason (Ooh, ooh, ooh)
Give me a reason, give me a reason, give me a reason (Ooh, reason, yeah)

[Verse 3]
Lucid dream, in reality
I'm just tryna feel your gravity
Always fallin in love, and I'm tired of the cycle
We don't even need a title
You're always on my mind
It's funny how I'm thinking about you all the damn time
You don't got to be mine, just be mine for the night
I don't know what this is but it feels just right
I wanna make a move
Let me know if that sounds cool, yeah
All the things I'd do
All the things I'd do for you

[Chorus]
There's millions of reasons to love you (Love you)
There's millions of reasons (There's millions of reasons, ooh)
You give me a reason to want you (Want you)
You give me a reason (Reason, ooh, ooh)
Give me a reason, give me a reason, give me a reason (Give me a reason)
Give me a reason, give me a reason, give me a reason (You give me a reason)

[Intro]
Cold blooded, cold blooded

[Verse 1]
The way you've been treating me is getting out of hand
And you walk around like you're so innocent
I gave you my heart and it melted in your arms
This isn't a place that I belong

[Pre-Chorus]
I feel your fear
Surrounded by your skin
You feel my heartbeat vibrate so violent
Inside of your head
I see it in your eyes
You're no good for me
And love is blind

[Chorus]
Ooh, and cold blooded, cold blooded
You want what I'm giving up
But my love is not enough
Cold blooded, cold blooded
And I can’t feel my fingertips
But you feel better when we touch

[Verse 2]
I lost my sight and you're leading me on
Is it 'cause you're used to guys always doing you wrong?
Do you really love me?
Or is it just revenge?
Lately you don't seem so genuine

[Pre-Chorus]
And I feel your fear
Surrounded by your skin
You feel my heartbeat vibrate so violent
Inside of your head
I see it in your eyes (see it in your eyes)
That you're no good for me
And love is blind

[Chorus]
Ooh, and cold blooded, cold blooded
You want what I'm giving up
But my love is not enough
Cold blooded, cold blooded
And I can't feel my fingertips
But you feel better when we touch

[Bridge]
Mmmm
Fill me up, keep me hot
Use me up of all I've got

[Pre-Chorus]
I feel your fear
Surrounded by your skin
You feel my heartbeat vibrate so violent
Inside of your head
I see it in your eyes
You're no good for me
And love is blind

[Chorus]
Ooh, and cold blooded, cold blooded
You want what I'm giving up
But my love is not enough
Cold blooded, cold blooded
And I can't feel my fingertips
But you feel better when we touch

[Outro]
Mmmm
Fill me up, keep me hot
Use me up of all I've got
Cold blooded, cold blooded (mmmm)
Cold blooded, cold blooded (mmmm)

[Verse 1]
Can't count up the times you've blown my line
And that's been on my mind a lot lately
I wanna leave the extra all behind, mmm
And I know that you wanna be my baby, mmm yeah

[Chorus]
Said, my bad
Blowin' me up, you've been wildin'
We was cool, yeah, we was vibin'
Gotta put my phone on silent
So my, my, my, my bad
Blowin' me up, you've been wildin'
We were cool, yeah, we was vibin'
Gotta put my phone on silent
So my, my, my bad

[Verse 2]
Oh, we both care about it
But arguing with me just isn't worth it
No, no, no
Don't go reachin' in your bag, your bag, yeah
I didn't text you back 'cause I was workin'
Ah, yeah

[Chorus]
Said, my bad
Blowin' me up, you've been wildin'
We was cool, yeah, we was vibin'
Gotta put my phone on silent
So my, my, my, my bad
Blowin' me up, you've been wildin'
We were cool, yeah, we was vibin'
Gotta put my phone on silent
So my, my, my bad

[Bridge]
Gave you all the signs
Gave you all of my time, my love
You're followin' the signs
But you're followin' the wrong signs, my love
Gave you all the signs
Gave you all of my time, my love
(Gave you all my time and all my love)
You're followin' the signs
But you're followin' the wrong signs, my love

[Chorus]
Said, my bad
Blowin' me up, you've been wildin'
We was cool, yeah, we was vibin' (Vibin')
Gotta put my phone on silent (On silent)
So my, my, my, my bad (My bad)
Blowin' me up, you've been wildin' (Blowin' me up)
We were cool, yeah, we was vibin'
Gotta put my phone on silent
So my, my, my bad

[Outro]
Oh my, my, my
Oh my, my, my
My bad, my bad
Alright

[Verse 1]
I lost my heart in the nighttime
She left me out in the cold
She left me broken and weary
Drunk off the lies she told
I fell in love in the morning
But when the day gets cold
I'm back to life in my lonely
City of El Paso

[Chorus]
But the days get harder in November
Love grows colder in the winter
All the things you say, I'll remember
Promise that you'll keep my love with ya
Promise that you'll keep my love with ya
Promise that you'll keep my love with ya
Love grows colder in the winter
Promise that you'll keep my love with ya

[Verse 2]
I lost my mind when you left me
And I didn't have much of that
But you were so quick to reject me
So I'll take my time being sad
I fell so hard, I'll admit it
The feeling wasn't mutual
So I'm back to live on my lonely
In the city of El Paso

[Chorus]
But the days get harder in November
Love grows colder in the winter
All the things you say, I'll remember
Promise that you'll keep my love with ya
Promise that you'll keep my love with ya
Promise that you'll keep my love with ya
Love grows colder in the winter
Promise that you'll keep my love with ya

[Bridge]
Promise, promise, promise, promise
Promise, promise, promise, promise
Promise, promise that you'll keep my love (keep my love)
Promise, promise, promise, promise
Promise, promise, promise, promise
Promise, promise that you'll keep my love (keep my love)

[Chorus]
But the days get harder in November
Love grows colder in the winter
All the things you say, I'll remember
Promise that you'll keep my love with ya
Promise that you'll keep my love with ya
Promise that you'll keep my love with ya
Love grows colder in the winter
Promise that you'll keep my love with ya

[Verse 1]
Are we better off believing
What the ignorance suggests?
I wish living life was easy (Mhm)
But mine has been a mess
They say it comes with the seasons (Mhm)
But the seasons come and go (They go)
I go blurry when I'm thinking
Is it me or vertigo?

[Pre-Chorus]
Criticized, who am I to give up?
I’m breathing, what's the reason to let up?
Sympathize, who am I to give up?
Putting on my favorite get up

[Chorus]
Are we alive?
Or are we dreaming?
After the ride
Are you leaving?
Are we alive? (Darker days, brighter endings)
Or are we dreaming? (Darker days, brighter endings)
After the ride
Are you leaving? (Darker days, brighter endings)
Yeah

[Verse 2]
I've been better off than broken
I’ve been battered, I've been beat
I wish I was more outspoken
But the words are out of reach
Hmm, thought I loved you in the moment
I was happy, I was young
I've been learning, I've been growing
But the worst is yet to come

[Pre-Chorus]
Criticized, who am I to give up? (Who am I?)
I'm breathing, what's the reason to let up?
Sympathize, who am I to give up?
Putting on my favorite get up

[Chorus]
Are we alive?
Or are we dreaming?
After the ride
Are you leaving?
Are we alive? (Darker days, brighter endings)
Or are we dreaming? (Darker days, brighter endings)
After the ride
Are you leaving? (Darker days, brighter endings)
Yeah


[Outro]
Eyes closed, eyes closed
I've been falling with my
Eyes low, eyes low
I've been falling with my
Eyes closed, eyes closed
I’ve been falling with my
Eyes low, eyes low
I’ve been falling with my
Eyes closed, eyes closed
I've been falling with my
Eyes low, eyes low
I’ve been falling with my (Vertigo)
Eyes closed, eyes closed (Vertigo)
I've been falling with my (Vertigo)
Eyes low, eyes low
I've been, I've been, I’ve been
Eyes closed, eyes closed
I've been falling with my
Eyes low, eyes low
I've been falling with my
Eyes closed, eyes closed
I've been falling with my
Eyes low, eyes low
I've been falling with my

[Verse 1]
The club isn't the best place to find a lover
So the bar is where I go
Me and my friends at the table doing shots
Drinking fast and then we talk slow
And you come over and start up a conversation with just me
And trust me I'll give it a chance now
Take my hand, stop, put Van the Man on the jukebox
And then we start to dance, and now I'm singing like

[Pre-Chorus]
Girl, you know I want your love
Your love was handmade for somebody like me
Come on now, follow my lead
I may be crazy, don't mind me
Say, boy, let's not talk too much
Grab on my waist and put that body on me
Come on now, follow my lead
Come, come on now, follow my lead

[Chorus]
I'm in love with the shape of you
We push and pull like a magnet do
Although my heart is falling too
I'm in love with your body
And last night you were in my room
And now my bed sheets smell like you
Every day discovering something brand new
I'm in love with your body
Oh—I—oh—I—oh—I—oh—I
I'm in love with your body
Oh—I—oh—I—oh—I—oh—I
I'm in love with your body
Oh—I—oh—I—oh—I—oh—I
I'm in love with your body
Every day discovering something brand new
I'm in love with the shape of you

[Verse 2]
One week in we let the story begin
We're going out on our first date
You and me are thrifty, so go all you can eat
Fill up your bag and I fill up a plate
We talk for hours and hours about the sweet and the sour
And how your family is doing okay
Leave and get in a taxi, then kiss in the backseat
Tell the driver make the radio play, and I'm singing like

[Pre-Chorus]
Girl, you know I want your love
Your love was handmade for somebody like me
Come on now, follow my lead
I may be crazy, don't mind me
Say, boy, let's not talk too much
Grab on my waist and put that body on me
Come on now, follow my lead
Come, come on now, follow my lead

[Chorus]
I'm in love with the shape of you
We push and pull like a magnet do
Although my heart is falling too
I'm in love with your body
And last night you were in my room
And now my bed sheets smell like you
Every day discovering something brand new
I'm in love with your body
Oh—I—oh—I—oh—I—oh—I
I'm in love with your body
Oh—I—oh—I—oh—I—oh—I
I'm in love with your body
Oh—I—oh—I—oh—I—oh—I
I'm in love with your body
Every day discovering something brand new
I'm in love with the shape of you

[Bridge]
Come on, be my baby, come on
Come on, be my baby, come on
Come on, be my baby, come on
Come on, be my baby, come on
Come on, be my baby, come on
Come on, be my baby, come on
Come on, be my baby, come on
Come on, be my baby, come on

[Chorus]
I'm in love with the shape of you
We push and pull like a magnet do
Although my heart is falling too
I'm in love with your body
Last night you were in my room
And now my bed sheets smell like you
Every day discovering something brand new
I'm in love with your body
Come on, be my baby, come on
Come on, be my baby, come on
I'm in love with your body
Come on, be my baby, come on
Come on, be my baby, come on
I'm in love with your body
Come on, be my baby, come on
Come on, be my baby, come on
I'm in love with your body
Every day discovering something brand new
I'm in love with the shape of you

[Verse 1]
I found a love for me
Oh darling, just dive right in and follow my lead
Well, I found a girl, beautiful and sweet
Oh, I never knew you were the someone waiting for me
'Cause we were just kids when we fell in love
Not knowing what it was
I will not give you up this time
But darling, just kiss me slow, your heart is all I own
And in your eyes, you're holding mine

[Chorus]
Baby, I'm dancing in the dark with you between my arms
Barefoot on the grass, listening to our favourite song
When you said you looked a mess, I whispered underneath my breath
But you heard it, darling, you look perfect tonight

[Verse 2]
Well I found a woman, stronger than anyone I know
She shares my dreams, I hope that someday I'll share her home
I found a love, to carry more than just my secrets
To carry love, to carry children of our own
We are still kids, but we're so in love
Fighting against all odds
I know we'll be alright this time
Darling, just hold my hand
Be my girl, I'll be your man
I see my future in your eyes

[Chorus 2]
Baby, I'm dancing in the dark, with you between my arms
Barefoot on the grass, listening to our favorite song
When I saw you in that dress, looking so beautiful
I don't deserve this, darling, you look perfect tonight

[Instrumental]

[Chorus 3]
Baby, I'm dancing in the dark, with you between my arms
Barefoot on the grass, listening to our favorite song
I have faith in what I see
Now I know I have met an angel in person
And she looks perfect
I don't deserve this
You look perfect tonight

[Verse 1]
When I was six years old I broke my leg
I was running from my brother and his friends
And tasted the sweet perfume of the mountain grass I rolled down
I was younger then, take me back to when I

[Pre-Chorus]
Found my heart and broke it here
Made friends and lost them through the years
And I've not seen the roaring fields in so long, I know I've grown
But I can't wait to go home

[Chorus]
I'm on my way
Driving at 90 down those country lanes
Singing to "Tiny Dancer"
And I miss the way you make me feel, and it's real
We watched the sunset over the castle on the hill

[Verse 2]
Fifteen years old and smoking hand-rolled cigarettes
Running from the law through the backfields and getting drunk with my friends
Had my first kiss on a Friday night, I don't reckon that I did it right
But I was younger then, take me back to when

[Pre-Chorus]
We found weekend jobs, when we got paid
We'd buy cheap spirits and drink them straight
Me and my friends have not thrown up in so long, oh how we've grown
But I can't wait to go home

[Chorus]
I'm on my way
Driving at 90 down those country lanes
Singing to "Tiny Dancer"
And I miss the way you make me feel, and it's real
We watched the sunset over the castle on the hill
Over the castle on the hill
Over the castle on the hill

[Bridge]
One friend left to sell clothes
One works down by the coast
One had two kids but lives alone
One's brother overdosed
One's already on his second wife
One's just barely getting by
But these people raised me
And I can't wait to go home

[Chorus]
And I'm on my way, I still remember
These old country lanes
When we did not know the answers
And I miss the way you make me feel, it's real
We watched the sunset over the castle on the hill
Over the castle on the hill
Over the castle on the hill

[Verse 1]
Walking down 29th and park
I saw you in another's arm
Only a month we've been apart
You look happier
Saw you walk inside a bar
He said something to make you laugh
I saw that both your smiles were twice as wide as ours
Yeah, you look happier, you do

[Pre-Chrous]
Ain't nobody hurt you like I hurt you
But ain't nobody love you like I do
Promise that I will not take it personal, baby
If you're moving on with someone new

[Chorus]
'Cause baby you look happier, you do
My friends told me one day I'll feel it too
And until then I'll smile to hide the truth
But I know I was happier with you

[Verse 2]
Sat in the corner of the room
Everything's reminding me of you
Nursing an empty bottle and telling myself
You're happier, aren't you?

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Oh, ain't nobody hurt you like I hurt you
But ain't nobody need you like I do
I know that there's others that deserve you
But my darling, I am still in love with you

[Chorus 2]
But I guess you look happier, you do
My friends told me one day I’ll feel it too
I could try to smile to hide the truth
But I know I was happier with you

[Outro]
‘Cause baby you look happier, you do
I knew one day you’d fall for someone new
But if he breaks your heart like lovers do
Just know that I’ll be waiting here for you

[Verse 1]
I took the supermarket flowers from the windowsill
I threw the day old tea from the cup
Packed up the photo album Matthew had made
Memories of a life that's been loved
Took the get well soon cards and stuffed animals
Poured the old ginger beer down the sink
Dad always told me, "Don't you cry when you're down"
But mum, there's a tear every time that I blink

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, I'm in pieces, it's tearing me up, but I know
A heart that's broke is a heart that's been loved

[Chorus]
So I'll sing Hallelujah
You were an angel in the shape of my mum
When I fell down you'd be there holding me up
Spread your wings as you go
When God takes you back
He'll say, "Hallelujah, you're home"

[Verse 2]
I fluffed the pillows, made the beds, stacked the chairs up
Folded your nightgowns neatly in a case
John says he'd drive then put his hand on my cheek
And wiped a tear from the side of my face

[Pre-Chorus]
I hope that I see the world as you did 'cause I know
A life with love is a life that's been lived

[Chorus]
So I'll sing Hallelujah
You were an angel in the shape of my mum
When I fell down you'd be there holding me up
Spread your wings as you go
When God takes you back
He'll say, "Hallelujah, you're home"

[Outro/Chorus]
Hallelujah
You were an angel in the shape of my mum
You got to see the person I have become
Spread your wings and I know
That when God took you back
He said, "Hallelujah, you're home"

[Chorus]
She played the fiddle in an Irish band
But she fell in love with an English man
Kissed her on the neck and then I took her by the hand
Said, "Baby, I just want to dance"

[Verse 1]
I met her on Grafton street right outside of the bar
She shared a cigarette with me while her brother played the guitar
She asked me what does it mean, the Gaelic ink on your arm?
Said it was one of my friend's songs, do you want to drink on?
She took Jamie as a chaser, Jack for the fun
She got Arthur on the table with Johnny riding a shotgun
Chatted some more, one more drink at the bar
Then put Van on the jukebox, got up to dance

[Chorus]
You know, she played the fiddle in an Irish band
But she fell in love with an English man
Kissed her on the neck and then I took her by the hand
Said, "Baby, I just want to dance"
With my pretty little Galway Girl
You're my pretty little Galway Girl

[Verse 2]
You know she beat me at darts and then she beat me at pool
And then she kissed me like there was nobody else in the room
As last orders were called was when she stood on the stool
After dancing the céili singing to trad tunes
I never heard Carrickfergus ever sung so sweet
A cappella in the bar using her feet for a beat
Oh, I could have that voice playing on repeat for a week
And in this packed out room swear she was singing to me

[Chorus]
You know, she played the fiddle in an Irish band
But she fell in love with an English man
Kissed her on the neck and then I took her by the hand
Said, "Baby, I just want to dance"
My pretty little Galway Girl
My, my, my, my, my, my, my Galway Girl
My, my, my, my, my, my, my Galway Girl
My, my, my, my, my, my, my Galway Girl

[Verse 3]
And now we've outstayed our welcome and it's closing time
I was holding her hand, her hand was holding mine
Our coats both smell of smoke, whisky and wine
As we fill up our lungs with the cold air of the night
I walked her home then she took me inside
To finish some Doritos and another bottle of wine
I swear I'm gonna put you in a song that I write
About a Galway Girl and a perfect night

[Chorus]
She played the fiddle in an Irish band
But she fell in love with an English man
Kissed her on the neck and then I took her by the hand
Said, "Baby, I just want to dance"
My pretty little Galway Girl
My, my, my, my, my, my, my Galway Girl
My, my, my, my, my, my, my Galway Girl
My, my, my, my, my, my, my Galway Girl

[Verse 1]
When your legs don't work like they used to before
And I can't sweep you off of your feet
Will your mouth still remember the taste of my love?
Will your eyes still smile from your cheeks?
And darling, I will be loving you till we're seventy
And baby, my heart could still fall as hard at twenty-three
And I'm thinking 'bout how

[Pre-Chorus 1]
People fall in love in mysterious ways
Maybe just the touch of a hand
Well me, I fall in love with you every single day
I just wanna tell you I am

[Chorus]
So honey, now, take me into your loving arms
Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars
Place your head on my beating heart, I'm thinking out loud
And maybe we found love right where we are

[Verse 2]
When my hair's all but gone and my memory fades
And the crowds don't remember my name
When my hands don't play the strings the same way
I know you will still love me the same
'Cause, honey, your soul could never grow old, it's evergreen
And baby, your smile's forever in my mind and memory
And I'm thinking 'bout how

[Pre-Chorus 2]
People fall in love in mysterious ways
And maybe it's all part of a plan
Well I'll just keep on making the same mistakes
Hoping that you'll understand

[Chorus]
That, baby, now, take me into your loving arms
Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars
Place your head on my beating heart, I'm thinking out loud
And maybe we found love right where we are

[Chorus]
So baby, now, take me into your loving arms
Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars
Oh darling, place your head on my beating heart, I'm thinking out loud
That maybe we found love right where we are
Oh baby, we found love right where we are
And we found love right where we are

[Verse 1]
Oh, maybe I came on too strong
Maybe I waited too long
Maybe I played my cards wrong
Oh, just a little bit wrong
Baby I apologize for it

[Pre-Chorus]
I could fall, or I could fly
Here in your aeroplane
And I could live, I could die
Hanging on the words you say
And I've been known to give my all
And jumping in harder than
Ten thousand rocks on the lake

[Chorus]
So don't call me baby
Unless you mean it
And don't tell me you need me
If you don't believe it
So let me know the truth
Before I dive right into you

[Verse 2]
You're a mystery
I've travelled the world
And there's no other girl like you
No one, what's your history? (What's your history?)
Do you have a tendency to lead some people on?
'Cause I heard you do, mmm

[Pre-Chorus]
I could fall, or I could fly
Here in your aeroplane
And I could live, I could die
Hanging on the words you say
And I've been known to give my all
And lie awake, every day
Don't know how much I can take

[Chorus]
So don't call me baby
Unless you mean it
Don't tell me you need me
If you don't believe it
So let me know the truth
Before I dive right into you

[Guitar Solo]

[Pre-Chorus]
I could fall, or I could fly
Here in your aeroplane
And I could live, I could die
Hanging on the words you say
And I've been known to give my all
Sitting back, looking at
Every mess that I made

[Chorus]
So don't call me baby
Unless you mean it
Don't tell me you need me
If you don't believe it
Let me know the truth
Before I dive right into you
Before I dive right into you
Before I dive right into you

[Verse 1]
Loving can hurt, loving can hurt sometimes
But it's the only thing that I know
When it gets hard, you know it can get hard sometimes
It is the only thing that makes us feel alive

[Pre-Chorus]
We keep this love in a photograph
We made these memories for ourselves
Where our eyes are never closing
Our hearts were never broken
And time's forever frozen, still

[Chorus]
So you can keep me
Inside the pocket of your ripped jeans
Holding me close until our eyes meet
You won't ever be alone, wait for me to come home

[Verse 2]
Loving can heal, loving can mend your soul
And it's the only thing that I know, know
I swear it will get easier, remember that with every piece of ya
And it's the only thing to take with us when we die

[Pre-Chorus]
We keep this love in a photograph
We made these memories for ourselves
Where our eyes are never closing
Our hearts were never broken
And time's forever frozen, still

[Chorus]
So you can keep me
Inside the pocket of your ripped jeans
Holding me close until our eyes meet
You won't ever be alone
And if you hurt me, that's okay, baby
Only words bleed inside these pages, you just hold me
And I won't ever let you go
Wait for me to come home

[Bridge]
Wait for me to come home
Wait for me to come home
Wait for me to come home

[Chorus]
Oh, you can fit me
Inside the necklace you got when you were 16
Next to your heartbeat where I should be
Keep it deep within your soul
And if you hurt me, that's okay, baby
Only words bleed inside these pages
You just hold me
And I won't ever let you go

[Outro]
When I'm away, I will remember how you kissed me
Under the lamppost back on Sixth street
Hearing you whisper through the phone
"Wait for me to come home"

[Verse 1]
I met this girl late last year
She said, "Don't you worry if I disappear"
I told her I'm not really looking for another mistake
I called an old friend thinking that the trouble would wait
But then I jumped right in a week later, returned
I reckon she was only looking for a lover to burn
But I gave her my time for two or three nights
Then I put it on pause until the moment was right
I went away for months until our paths crossed again
She told me, "I was never looking for a friend
Maybe you could swing by my room around ten
Baby, bring the lemon and a bottle of gin
We'll be in between the sheets till the late AM"
Baby, if you wanted me then you should have just said, she's singing

[Chorus]
Don't fuck with my love
That heart is so cold
All over my home
I don't wanna know that babe
Don't fuck with my love
I told her she knows
Take aim and reload
I don't wanna know that babe

[Verse 2]
And for a couple weeks I only wanna see her
We drink away the days with a takeaway pizza
Before a text message was the only way to reach her
Now she's staying at my place and loves the way I treat her
Singing out Aretha, all over the track like a feature
And never wants to sleep, I guess that I don't want to either
But me and her, we make money the same way
Four cities, two planes, the same day
And those shows have never been what it's about
But maybe we'll go together and just figure it out
I'd rather put on a film with you and sit on a couch
But we should get on a plane or we'll be missing it now
Wish I'd have written it down, the way that things played out
When she was kissing him, how I was confused about
Now she should figure it out, while I'm sat here singing

[Chorus]
Don't fuck with my love
That heart is so cold
All over my home
I don't wanna know that babe
Don't fuck with my love
I told her she knows
Take aim and reload
I don't wanna know that babe

[Verse 3]
(Knock, knock, knock) on my hotel door
I don't even know if she knows what for
She was crying on my shoulder, I already told ya
Trust and respect is what we do this for
I never intended to be next (You bastard)
But you didn't need to take him to bed, that's all
And I never saw him as a threat (You bastard)
Until you disappeared with him to have sex, of course
It's not like we were both on tour
We were staying on the same fucking hotel floor
And I wasn't looking for a promise or commitment
But it was never just fun, and I thought you were different
This is not the way you realised what you wanted
It's a bit too much, too late if I'm honest
And all this time, God knows I'm singing

[Chorus]
Don't fuck with my love
That heart is so cold
All over my home
I don't wanna know that babe
Don't fuck with my love
I told her she knows
Take aim and reload
I don't wanna know that babe
Don't fuck with my love
That heart is so cold
All over my home
I don't wanna know that babe
Don't fuck with my love
I told her she knows
Take aim and reload
I don't wanna know that babe

[Verse 1]
White lips, pale face
Breathing in the snowflakes
Burnt lungs, sour taste
Light's gone, days end
Struggling to pay rent
Long nights, strange men

[Pre-Chorus]
And they say
She's in the Class A Team
Stuck in her daydream
Been this way since 18
But lately, her face seems
Slowly sinking, wasting
Crumbling like pastries
And they scream
The worst things in life come free to us

[Chorus]
'Cause we're just under the upper hand
And go mad for a couple grams
And she don't want to go outside tonight
And in a pipe she flies to the Motherland
Or sells love to another man
It's too cold outside
For angels to fly
Angels to fly

[Verse 2]
Ripped gloves, raincoat
Tried to swim and stay afloat
Dry house, wet clothes
Loose change, bank notes
Weary-eyed, dry throat
Call girl, no phone

[Pre-Chorus]
And they say
She's in the Class A Team
Stuck in her daydream
Been this way since 18
But lately, her face seems
Slowly sinking, wasting
Crumbling like pastries
And they scream
The worst things in life come free to us

[Chorus]
'Cause we're just under the upper hand
And go mad for a couple grams
And she don't want to go outside tonight
And in a pipe she flies to the Motherland
Or sells love to another man
It's too cold outside
For angels to fly

[Bridge]
An angel will die
Covered in white
Closed eyes and hopin' for a better life
This time, we'll fade out tonight
Straight down the line

[Pre-Chorus]
And they say
She's in the Class A Team
Stuck in her daydream
Been this way since 18
But lately, her face seems
Slowly sinking, wasting
Crumbling like pastries
And they scream
The worst things in life come free to us

[Chorus]
And we're all under the upper hand
And go mad for a couple grams
And we don't want to go outside tonight
And in a pipe we fly to the Motherland
Or sell love to another man
It's too cold outside
For angels to fly
Angels to fly
Fly, fly
For angels to fly
To fly, to fly
For angels to die

[Verse 1: Ed Sheeran]
She got the mmm, brown eyes, caramel thighs
Long hair, no wedding ring, hey
I saw you lookin' from across the way
And now I really wanna know your name
She got the mmm, white dress, but when she’s wearin' less
Man, you know that she drives me crazy
The mmm, brown eyes, beautiful smile
You know I love watching you do your thing

[Pre-Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
I love her hips, curves, lips say the words
"Te amo, mami, ah, te amo, mami"
I kiss her, this love is like a dream

[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
So join me in this bed that I'm in
Push up on me and sweat, darling
So I’m gonna put my time in
I won't stop until the angels sing
Jump in that water, be free
Come south of the border with me
Jump in that water, be free
Come south of the border with me

[Verse 2: Camila Cabello]
He got that mmm, green eyes, givin' me signs
That he really wants to know my name—hey
I saw you lookin' from across the way
And suddenly, I'm glad I came, ay
Ven para acá, quiero bailar, toma mi mano
Quiero sentir tu cuerpo en mí, estás temblando
Mmm, green eyes, takin' your time
Now we know we'll never be the same

[Pre-Chorus: Camila Cabello]
I love his lips 'cause he says the words
"Te amo, mami, ah, te amo, mami"
Don’t wake up, this love is like a dream

[Chorus: Ed Sheeran & Camila Cabello, Ed Sheeran, Camila Cabello]
So join me in this bed that I’m in
Push up on me and sweat, darling
So I'm gonna put my time in (Time in)
And won’t stop until the angels sing
Jump in that water, be free
Come south of the border with me
Jump in that water, be free
Come south of the border with me (Rrrat)
Flawless diamonds
In a green field near Buenos Aires
Until the sun's rising
We won't stop until the angels sing
Jump in that water, be free
Come south of the border with me
Jump in that water, be free
Come south of the border with me

[Verse 3: Cardi B & Camila Cabello]
Bardi, uh
You never live 'til you risk your life (Life)
You wanna shine, you gotta get more ice (Ice, ice, oh)
Am I your lover or I’m just your vice? (Woo, yeah, yeah)
A little crazy, but I'm just your type (Okurrr)
You want the lips and the curves, need the whips and the furs
And the diamonds I prefer, in my closet, his and hers, ayy
He want the lil' mamacita, margarita (Margarita)
I think that Ed got a lil' jungle fever, ayy (Woo!)
You are more than (You are more than)
Something borin' (Something borin')
Legs open, tongue out, Michael Jordan, uh (Uh)
Go explore in (Woo, woo) somethin' foreign (Skrrt, skrrt)
Bust it up, a rain forest, it be pourin', yeah
Kiss me like you need me, rub me like a genie
Pull up to my spot in Lamborghini
'Cause you gotta see me, never leave me (Never leave me)
You got a girl that could finally do it all
Drop a album, drop a baby, but I never drop the ball, uh

[Chorus: Ed Sheeran, Camila Cabello & Both]
So join me in this bed (This bed) that I'm in (That I'm in)
Push up on me and sweat, darling (Oh no, no, no)
So I'm gonna put my time in
I won't stop until the angels sing (Nah, nah, nah)
Jump in that water, be free
Come south of the border with me
Come south of the border, border (Hey)
Come south of the border with me
Come south of the border, border
Come south of the border with me
Jump in that water, be free
Come south of the border with me
Jump in that water, be free
Come south of the border with me

[Verse 1]
I was born inside a small town, I lost that state of mind
Learned to sing inside the Lord's house, but stopped the age of nine
I forget when I get awards now the wave I had to ride
The paving stones I played upon that kept me on the grind
So blame it on the pain that blessed me with the life
Friends and family filled with envy when they should be filled with pride
And when the world's against me is when I really come alive
And every day that Satan tempts me, I try to take it in my stride
You know that I've got whisky with white lies, and smoke in my lungs
I think life has got to the point, I know without it's no fun
I need to get in the right mind, and clear myself up
Instead, I look in the mirror questioning what I've become
Guess it's a stereotypical day for someone like me
Without a nine-to-five job or a uni degree
To be caught up in the trappings of the industry
Show me the locked doors, I'll find another use for the key
And you'll see

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm well aware of certain things that can destroy a man like me
But with that said give me one more

[Chorus]
Another one to take the sting away
I am happy on my own, so here I'll stay
Save your lovin' arms for a rainy day
And I'll find comfort in my pain eraser

[Verse 2]
I used to think that nothing could be better than touring the world with my songs
I chased the pictured perfect life, I think they painted it wrong
I think that money is the root of all evil, and fame is hell
Relationships, and hearts you fixed, they break as well
And ain't nobody wanna see you down in the dumps
Because you're living your dream, man, this shit should be fun
Please know that I'm not trying to preach like I'm Reverend Run
I beg you, don't be disappointed with the man I've become
Conversations with my father on the A14
Age 12 telling me I've gotta chase those dreams
Now I'm playing for the people, dad, and they know me
With my beaten small guitar, wearing the same old jeans
Wembley Stadium crowd's 240 thou'
I may have grown up, but I hope that Damian's proud
And to the next generation, inspiration's allowed
The world may be filled with hate, but keep erasing it now
Somehow

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm well aware of certain things that will befall a man like me
But with that said give me one more

[Chorus]
Another one to take the sting away
Oh, I am happy on my own, so here I'll stay
Save your lovin' arms for a rainy day
And I'll find comfort in my pain eraser
And I'll find comfort in my pain eraser
And I'll find comfort in my pain eraser

[Bridge]
Welcome to the new show
I guess you know I've been away
But where I'm heading, who knows?
But my heart will stay the same
Welcome to the new show
I guess you know I've been away
But where I'm heading, who knows?
My pain eraser

[Chorus]
And I'll find comfort in my pain eraser
And I'll find comfort in my pain eraser
And I'll find comfort in my pain eraser
And I'll find comfort in my pain eraser

[Intro: Ed Sheeran]
We are, we are, we are

[Verse 1: Ed Sheeran]
L.A. on a Saturday night in the summer
Sundown and they all come out
Lamborghinis and their rented Hummers
The party's on, so they're headin' downtown ('Round here)
Everybody's lookin' for a come up
And they wanna know what you're about
Me in the middle with the one I love and
We're just tryna figure everything out

[Pre-Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
We don't fit in well 'cause we are just ourselves
I could use some help gettin' out of this conversation, yeah
You look stunning, dear, so don't ask that question here
This is my only fear: that we become

[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
Beautiful people
Drop top, designer clothes
Front row at fashion shows
"What d'you do?" and "Who d'you know?"
Inside the world of beautiful people
Champagne and rolled-up notes
Prenups and broken homes
Surrounded, but still alone
Let's leave the party

[Post-Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
That's not who we are (We are, we are, we are)
We are not beautiful
Yeah, that's not who we are (We are, we are, we are)
We are not beautiful (Beautiful)

[Verse 2: Khalid]
L.A., mmm
Drove for hours last night and we made it nowhere (Nowhere, nowhere)
I see stars in your eyes when we're halfway there (All night)
I'm not fazed by all them lights and flashin' cameras
'Cause with my arms around you, there's no need to care

[Pre-Chorus: Khalid]
We don't fit in well, we are just ourselves
I could use some help gettin' out of this conversation, yeah
You look stunning, dear, so don't ask that question here
This is my only fear: that we become

[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
Beautiful people
Drop top, designer clothes
Front row at fashion shows
"What d'you do?" and "Who d'you know?"
Inside the world of beautiful people
Champagne and rolled-up notes
Prenups and broken homes
Surrounded, but still alone
Let's leave the party

[Post-Chorus: Ed Sheeran, Both, Khalid]
That's not who we are (We are, we are, we are)
We are not beautiful, yeah
Yeah, that's not who we are (We are, we are, we are)
We are not beautiful (Beautiful)

[Outro: Ed Sheeran]
We are, we are, we are
We are not beautiful

[Intro]
Oh misty eye of the mountain below
Keep careful watch of my brothers' souls
And should the sky be filled with fire and smoke
Keep watching over Durin's sons

[Verse 1]
If this is to end in fire, then we should all burn together
Watch the flames climb high into the night
Calling out father oh, stand by and we will
Watch the flames burn auburn on the mountain side

[Verse 2]
And if we should die tonight, we should all die together
Raise a glass of wine for the last time
Calling out father oh, prepare as we will
Watch the flames burn auburn on the mountain side
Desolation comes upon the sky

[Chorus]
Now I see fire, inside the mountain
I see fire, burning the trees
And I see fire, hollowing souls
I see fire, blood in the breeze
And I hope that you remember me

[Verse 3]
Oh, should my people fall then surely I'll do the same
Confined in mountain halls, we got too close to the flame
Calling out father oh, hold fast and we will
Watch the flames burn auburn on the mountain side
Desolation comes upon the sky

[Chorus]
Now I see fire, inside the mountain
I see fire, burning the trees
And I see fire, hollowing souls
I see fire, blood in the breeze
And I hope that you remember me

[Bridge]
And if the night is burning, I will cover my eyes
For if the dark returns then my brothers will die
And as the sky's falling down it crashed into this lonely town
And with that shadow upon the ground I hear my people screaming out

[Outro]
Now I see fire, inside the mountain
I see fire, burning the trees
I see fire, hollowing souls
I see fire, blood in the breeze
I see fire (oh you know I saw a city burning out)
I see fire (feel the heat upon my skin)
I see fire
And I see fire burn auburn on the mountainside

[Verse 1: Ed Sheeran]
Yeah, I was born a misfit
Grew up 10 miles from the town of Ipswich
Wanted to make it big, I wished it to existence
I never was a sick kid, always dismissed quick
"Stick to singing, stop rappin' like it's Christmas"
And if you're talkin' money, then my conversation's shiftin'
My dreams are bigger than just bein' on the rich list
Might be insanity, but people call it "gifted"
My face is goin' numb from the shit this stuff is mixed with
Watch how the lyrics in the songs might get twisted
My wife wears red, but looks better without the lipstick
I'm a private guy and you know nothin' 'bout my business
And if I had my 15 minutes, I must have missed 'em
20 years old is when I came in the game
And now it's eight years on and you remember the name
And if you thought I was good, well, then I'm better today
But it's ironic how you people thought I'd never be great
I like my shows open-air, Tokyo to Delaware
Put your phones in the air if you wanna be rocked
You know I want way more than I already got
Give me a song with Eminem and 50 Cent in the club

[Chorus: Ed Sheeran & 50 Cent]
You know it ain't my time to call it a day
I wanna crack on and I wanna be paid
But it's 'bout time you remember the name
Ayy, ayy
You know it ain't my time to call it a day
I wanna crack on and I wanna be paid
But it's 'bout time you remember the name
Ayy, ayy
(Hey, hey, hey)

[Verse 2: Eminem]
I can still remember (What?) tryna shop a deal (Uh-huh)
From Taco Bell to TRL
I climbed the Billboard charts to the top until
As fate would have it (Yeah), became an addict
Funny 'cause I had pop appeal
But they said time would tell (What?) if I'd prevail (Huh?)
And all I did was (What?) put nine-inch nails (Where?)
In my eyelids now (What?)
I'm seein' diamond sales like I'm in Zales (Yeah)
Without a doubt, by any means
If rap was skinny jeans, I couldn't do anything in 'em
I'd be splitting seams of denim when I'm spitting schemes
Which really means, no "if," "ands," or "buts" are squeezin' in between
You sleep on me 'cause you're only fuckin' with me in your dreams
Not even when I'm on my deathbed
Man, I feel like Ed, it isn't time to drop the mic yet
So why would I quit?
The thought that I would stop when I'm dead
Just popped in my head
I said it, then forgot what I said

[Chorus: Ed Sheeran & Eminem]
It isn't my time to call it a day
I got rap locked and I'm already paid
But it's 'bout time you remember the name
Ayy, ayy
You know it ain't my time to call it a day
I got rap locked and I'm already paid
But it's 'bout time you remember the name
Ayy, ayy

[Verse 3: 50 Cent]
Ain't nobody cold as me, I dress so fresh, so clean
You can find me in my whip, rockin' my Fendi drip
Man, you know just what I mean
Shinin', wrist with the rocks on it, Buscemis with locks on it
Everything my voice on, this shit knock, don't it?
Balenciaga saga, I'm in Bergdorf ballin'
It's just another episode, my hoes, I spoil 'em
She like the fly shit and I like to buy shit
Shit, I'm gettin' stupid money, what else we gon' do with money?
Bitch, we be ballin' out, the king bring you 50 bottles
Tonight, we gon' blow a check, worry 'bout your shit tomorrow
The turn up be so real, we 'bout to be super lit
Boy, I'm kickin' straight facts, that's just how we do this shit
Tomorrow, we hangin' over 'til we start feelin' sober
Then it's time to start it over, here we go again

[Chorus: Ed Sheeran & Eminem, 50 Cent]
You know it ain't my time to call it a day
I got rap locked and I'm already paid
And it's about time you remember the name
Ayy, ayy
You know it ain't my time to call it a day
I got rap locked and I'm already paid
But it's 'bout time you remember the name
Ayy, ayy
(Hey, hey, hey)

[Intro]
Nah nah nah nah nah

[Verse 1]
I heard he spent five hundred pounds on jeans
Goes to the gym at least six times a week
Wears boat shoes with no socks on his feet
And I hear he's on a new diet and watches what he eats
He's got his eyebrows plucked and his arsehole bleached
Owns every single Ministry CD
Tribal tattoos and he don't know what it means
But I heard he makes you happy, so that's fine by me
But still, I'm just keepin' it real
Still lookin' at your Instagram and I'll be creepin' a lil'
I'll be tryin' not to double tap, from way back
'Cause I know that's where the trouble's at
Let me remind you of the days when
You used to hold my hand
And when we sipped champagne out of cider cans
I guess if you were Lois Lane, I wasn't Superman
Just a young boy tryin' to be loved
So let me give it to ya

[Chorus]
I don't wanna know about your new man
'Cause if it was meant to be
You wouldn't be callin' me up tryin' to
'Cause I'm positive that he don't wanna know about me
I don't wanna know about your new man
We'll get there eventually
I know you're missin' all this kind of love
But I'm positive that he don't wanna know about me

[Verse 2]
Your new man rents a house in the 'burb
And wears a man bag on his shoulder, but I call it a purse
Every year, he goes to Málaga with all the fellas
Drinks beer, but has a six pack, I'm kinda jealous
He wears sunglasses indoors, in winter, at nighttime
And every time a rap song comes on, he makes a gang sign
Says "Chune, bwoydem light up the room!"
But enough about him, girl, let's talk about you
You were the type of girl who sat beside the water readin'
Eatin' a packet of crisps, but you will never find you cheatin'
Now you're eatin' kale, hittin' the gym
Keepin' up with Kylie and Kim
In the back of the club, kissin' a boy that ain't him
Okay, you need to be alone
And if you wanna talk about it, you can call my phone
I just thought I would tell you, 'cause you oughta know
You're still a young girl tryin' to be loved
So let me give it to ya

[Chorus]
I don't wanna know about your new man
'Cause if it was meant to be
You wouldn't be callin' me up tryin' to
'Cause I'm positive that he don't wanna know about me
I don't wanna know about your new man
We'll get there eventually
I know you're missin' all this kind of love
But I'm positive that he don't wanna know about me

[Bridge]
Baby, I'm not tryin' to ruin your week
But you act so differently
When you're with him, I know you're lonely
Please remember you're still free
To make the choice and leave
Don't call me up, you need to show me

[Chorus]
I don't wanna know about your new man
'Cause if it was meant to be
You wouldn't be callin' me up tryin' to
'Cause I'm positive that he don't wanna know about me
I don't wanna know about your new man
We'll get there eventually
I know you're missin' all this kind of love
But I'm positive that he don't wanna know about me

[Outro]
But I'm positive that he don't wanna know about
But I'm positive that he don't wanna know about
I don't wanna know about your new man

[Verse 1]
You are the one, girl
And you know that it's true
I'm feeling younger
Every time that I'm alone with you

[Pre-Chorus]
We were sitting in a parked car
Stealing kisses in a front yard
We got questions we should not ask, but

[Chorus]
How would you feel
If I told you I loved you?
It's just something that I want to do
I'll be taking my time
Spending my life
Falling deeper in love with you
So tell me that you love me too

[Verse 2]
In the summer
As the lilacs bloom
Love flows deeper than the river
Every moment that I spend with you

[Pre-Chorus]
We were sat upon our best friend's roof
I had both of my arms around you
Watching the sunrise replace the moon, but

[Chorus]
How would you feel
If I told you I loved you?
It's just something that I want to do
I'll be taking my time
Spending my life
Falling deeper in love with you
So tell me that you love me too

[Guitar Solo: John Mayer]

[Pre-Chorus]
Yeah, we were sitting in a parked car
Stealing kisses in a front yard
We got questions we should not ask

[Chorus]
How would you feel
If I told you I loved you?
It's just something that I want to do
I'll be taking my time
Spending my life
Falling deeper in love with you
Tell me that you love me too
Tell me that you love me too
Tell me that you love me too

[Verse 1]
I was twenty-four years old
When I met the woman I would call my own
Twenty-two grand kids now growing old
In that house that your brother bought ya
On the summer day when I proposed
I made that wedding ring from dentist gold
And I asked her father, but her daddy said, "No
You can't marry my daughter"

[Chorus]
She and I went on the run
Don't care about religion
I'm gonna marry the woman I love
Down by the Wexford border
She was Nancy Mulligan
And I was William Sheeran
She took my name and then we were one
Down by the Wexford border

[Verse 2]
Well, I met her at Guy's in the second World War
And she was working on a soldier's ward
Never had I seen such beauty before
The moment that I saw her
Nancy was my yellow rose
And we got married wearing borrowed clothes
We got eight children, now growing old
Five sons and three daughters

[Chorus]
She and I went on the run
Don't care about religion
I'm gonna marry the woman I love
Down by the Wexford border
She was Nancy Mulligan
And I was William Sheeran
She took my name and then we were one
Down by the Wexford border

[Verse 3]
From her snow white streak in her jet black hair
Over sixty years I've been loving her
Now we're sat by the fire in our old armchairs
You know Nancy, I adore ya
From a farm boy born near Belfast town
I never worried about the king and crown
'Cause I found my heart upon the southern ground
There's no difference, I assure ya

[Chorus]
She and I went on the run
Don't care about religion
I'm gonna marry the woman I love
Down by the Wexford border
She was Nancy Mulligan
And I was William Sheeran
She took my name and then we were one
Down by the Wexford border

[Verse 1]
Well get up, up on the dancefloor tonight
I've got two left feet and a bottle of red wine
Making me feel like the beat and the bassline
Are in my blood, both hands up on her waistline
Get on up, baby, dance to the rhythm of the music
Don't care what the DJ chooses
Get lost in the rhythm of me
Place don't close until we wanna leave it

[Chorus]
And you and I, we're flying on an aeroplane tonight
We're going, somewhere where the sun is shining bright
Just close your eyes
And let's pretend we're dancing in the street

[Hook]
In Barcelona
Barcelona
Barcelona
Barcelona

[Verse 2]
Well, get up, up on the dancefloor, move, it's a Saturday night
I fell in love with the sparkle in the moonlight
Reflected in your beautiful eyes
I guess that is destiny doing it right
And dance like they do in the Mediterranean
Spin you around me again and again, and
You're like something that God has sent me
I want you, baby, solamente

[Chorus]
And you and I, we're flying on an aeroplane tonight
We're going, somewhere where the sun is shining bright
Just close your eyes
And let's pretend we're dancing in the street

[Hook]
In Barcelona
Barcelona
Barcelona
Barcelona
Barcelona
Barcelona
Oh, Barcelona
So let's pretend we're dancing in the street
In Barcelona

[Verse 3]
Las Ramblas, I'll meet you
We'll dance around La Sagrada Familia (Barcelona)
Drinking Sangría
Mi niña, te amo mi cariño (Barcelona)
Mamacita, rica
Sí tú, te adoro, señorita (Barcelona)
Nosotros, vivir la vida
Come on, let's be free in Barcelona
Las Ramblas, I'll meet you
Come on and dance with me in Barcelona
Drinking Sangría
I just want to be in Barcelona
Mamacita, rica
Feel that summer breeze in Barcelona
Los otros, viva la vida
Siempre vida Barcelona

[Verse 1]
We could leave the Christmas lights up 'til January
And this is our place, we make the rules
And there's a dazzling haze, a mysterious way about you, dear
Have I known you 20 seconds or 20 years?

[Chorus]
Can I go where you go?
Can we always be this close?
Forever and ever, ah
Take me out, and take me home
You're my, my, my, my lover

[Verse 2]
We could let our friends crash in the living room
This is our place, we make the call
And I'm highly suspicious that everyone who sees you wants you
I've loved you three summers now, honey, but I want 'em all

[Chorus]
Can I go where you go?
Can we always be this close?
Forever and ever, ah
Take me out, and take me home (Forever and ever)
You're my, my, my, my lover

[Bridge]
Ladies and gentlemen, will you please stand?
With every guitar string scar on my hand
I take this magnetic force of a man to be my lover
My heart's been borrowed and yours has been blue
All's well that ends well to end up with you
Swear to be overdramatic and true to my lover
And you'll save all your dirtiest jokes for me
And at every table, I'll save you a seat, lover

[Chorus]
Can I go where you go?
Can we always be this close?
Forever and ever, ah
Take me out, and take me home (Forever and ever)
You're my, my, my, my
Oh, you're my, my, my, my
Darling, you're my, my, my, my lover

[Verse 1]
I don't like your little games
Don't like your tilted stage
The role you made me play
Of the fool, no, I don't like you
I don't like your perfect crime
How you laugh when you lie
You said the gun was mine
Isn't cool, no, I don't like you (Oh)

[Pre-Chorus]
But I got smarter, I got harder in the nick of time
Honey, I rose up from the dead, I do it all the time
I've got a list of names and yours is in red, underlined
I check it once, then I check it twice, oh!

[Chorus]
Ooh, look what you made me do
Look what you made me do
Look what you just made me do
Look what you just made me—
Ooh, look what you made me do
Look what you made me do
Look what you just made me do
Look what you just made me do

[Verse 2]
I don't like your kingdom keys
They once belonged to me
You asked me for a place to sleep
Locked me out and threw a feast (What?)
The world moves on, another day, another drama, drama
But not for me, not for me, all I think about is karma
And then the world moves on, but one thing's for sure
Maybe I got mine, but you'll all get yours

[Pre-Chorus]
But I got smarter, I got harder in the nick of time
Honey, I rose up from the dead, I do it all the time
I've got a list of names and yours is in red, underlined
I check it once, then I check it twice, oh!

[Chorus]
Ooh, look what you made me do
Look what you made me do
Look what you just made me do
Look what you just made me—
Ooh, look what you made me do
Look what you made me do
Look what you just made me do
Look what you just made me do

[Bridge]
I don't trust nobody and nobody trusts me
I'll be the actress starring in your bad dreams
I don't trust nobody and nobody trusts me
I'll be the actress starring in your bad dreams
I don't trust nobody and nobody trusts me
I'll be the actress starring in your bad dreams
I don't trust nobody and nobody trusts me
I'll be the actress starring in your bad dreams
(Ooh, look what you made me do
Look what you made me do
Look what you just made me do
Look what you just made me—
Ooh, look what you made me do
Look what you made me do
Look what you just made me—)
"I'm sorry, the old Taylor can't come to the phone right now
"Why? Oh, 'cause she's dead!" (Oh)

[Chorus]
Ooh, look what you made me do
Look what you made me do
Look what you just made me do
Look what you just made me—
Ooh, look what you made me do
Look what you made me do
Look what you just made me do
Look what you just made me do
Ooh, look what you made me do
Look what you made me do
Look what you just made me do
Look what you just made me—
Ooh, look what you made me do
Look what you made me do
Look what you just made me do
Look what you just made me do

[Chorus: Taylor Swift & Future]
I wanna be your end game
I wanna be your first string
I wanna be your A-Team (Whoa, whoa, whoa)
I wanna be your end game, end game

[Post-Chorus: Taylor Swift & Future]
Big reputation, big reputation
Ooh, you and me, we got big reputations, ah
And you heard about me, ooh
I got some big enemies (Yeah)
Big reputation, big reputation
Ooh, you and me would be a big conversation, ah (Git, git)
And I heard about you, ooh (Yeah)
You like the bad ones, too

[Verse 1: Future]
You so dope, don't overdose, I’m so stoked, I need a toast
We do the most, I'm in the Ghost like I'm whippin’ a boat
I got a reputation, girl that don't precede me (Yeah)
I'm one call away whenever you need me (Yeah)
I'm in a G5 (Yeah), come to the A-Side (Yeah)
I got a bad boy persona, that's what they like (What they like)
You love it, I love it too 'cause you my type (You my type)
You hold me down and I protect you with my life

[Pre-Chorus: Taylor Swift & Future]
I don't wanna touch you, I don't wanna be
Just another ex-love you don’t wanna see
I don’t wanna miss you (I don't wanna miss you)
Like the other girls do
I don’t wanna hurt you, I just wanna be
Drinking on a beach with you all over me
I know what they all say (I know what they all say)
But I ain't tryna play

[Chorus: Taylor Swift]
I wanna be your end game (End game)
I wanna be your first string (First string)
I wanna be your A-Team (A-Team)
I wanna be your end game, end game

[Verse 2: Ed Sheeran]
Knew her when I was young, reconnected when we were little bit older
Both sprung, I got issues and chips on both of my shoulders
Reputation precedes me, in rumors, I'm knee-deep
The truth is, it's easier to ignore it, believe me
Even when we’d argue, we'd not do it for long
And you understand the good and bad end up in the song
For all your beautiful traits, and the way you do it with ease
For all my flaws, paranoia, and insecurities
I've made mistakes and made some choices, that's hard to deny
After the storm, something was born on the 4th of July
I've passed days without fun, this end game is the one
With four words on the tip of my tongue, I'll never say it

[Pre-Chorus: Taylor Swift]
I don't wanna touch you, I don't wanna be
Just another ex-love you don't wanna see
I don't wanna miss you (I don't wanna miss you)
Like the other girls do
I don't wanna hurt you, I just wanna be
Drinking on a beach with you all over me
I know what they all say, yeah
But I ain't tryna play

[Chorus: Taylor Swift]
I wanna be your end game (End game)
I wanna be your first string (Wanna be your first string)
I wanna be your A-Team (A-Team)
I wanna be your end game, end game

[Post-Chorus: Taylor Swift & Future]
Big reputation, big reputation
Ooh, you and me, we got big reputations, ah
And you heard about me, ooh
I got some big enemies
Hey, big reputation, big reputation
Ooh, you and me would be a big conversation, ah
And I heard about you, ooh
You like the bad ones, too

[Verse 3: Taylor Swift]
I hit you like bang, we tried to forget it, but we just couldn't
And I bury hatchets, but I keep maps of where I put 'em
Reputation precedes me, they told you I'm crazy
I swear I don't love the drama, it loves me
And I can't let you go, your hand prints on my soul
It's like your eyes are liquor, it's like your body is gold
You've been calling my bluff on all my usual tricks
So here's the truth from my red lips

[Chorus: Taylor Swift, Future, & Ed Sheeran]
I wanna be your end game (End game)
I wanna be your first string (Me and you, first string)
I wanna be your A-Team (Be your A-Team now, A-Team)
I wanna be your end game, end game
I wanna be your end game (Oh, I do)
I wanna be your first string (First string)
I wanna be your A-Team (A-Team)
I wanna be your end game, end game

[Intro: Taylor Swift]
I promise that you'll never find another like me

[Verse 1: Taylor Swift]
I know that I'm a handful, baby, uh
I know I never think before I jump
And you're the kind of guy the ladies want
(And there's a lot of cool chicks out there)
I know that I went psycho on the phone
I never leave well enough alone
And trouble's gonna follow where I go
(And there's a lot of cool chicks out there)

[Pre-Chorus: Taylor Swift]
But one of these things is not like the others
Like a rainbow with all of the colors
Baby doll, when it comes to a lover
I promise that you'll never find another like

[Chorus: Taylor Swift]
Me-e-e, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
I'm the only one of me
Baby, that's the fun of me
Eeh-eeh-eeh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
You're the only one of you
Baby, that's the fun of you
And I promise that nobody's gonna love you like me-e-e

[Verse 2: Brendon Urie & Taylor Swift]
I know I tend to make it about me
I know you never get just what you see
But I will never bore you, baby
(And there's a lot of lame guys out there)
And when we had that fight out in the rain
You ran after me and called my name
I never wanna see you walk away
(And there's a lot of lame guys out there)

[Pre-Chorus: Taylor Swift & Brendon Urie, Brendon Urie]
'Cause one of these things is not like the others
Livin' in winter, I am your summer
Baby doll, when it comes to a lover
I promise that you'll never find another like

[Chorus: Brendon Urie, Taylor Swift & Brendon Urie]
Me-e-e, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
I'm the only one of me
Let me keep you company
Eeh-eeh-eeh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
You're the only one of you
Baby, that's the fun of you
And I promise that nobody's gonna love you like me-e-e

[Bridge: Brendon Urie, Taylor Swift & Both]
Girl, there ain't no I in "team"
But you know there is a "me"
Strike the band up, 1, 2, 3
I promise that you'll never find another like me
Girl, there ain't no I in "team"
But you know there is a "me"
And you can't spell "awesome" without "me"
I promise that you'll never find another like

[Chorus: Both, Taylor Swift & Brendon Urie]
Me-e-e (Yeah), ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh (And I want ya, baby)
I'm the only one of me (I'm the only one of me)
Baby, that's the fun of me (Baby, that's the fun of me)
Eeh-eeh-eeh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh (Oh)
You're the only one of you (Oh)
Baby, that's the fun of you
And I promise that nobody's gonna love you like me-e-e

[Outro: Brendon Urie, Taylor Swift & Both]
Girl, there ain't no I in "team" (Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
But you know there is a "me"
I'm the only one of me (Oh-oh)
Baby, that's the fun of me
(Eeh-eeh-eeh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
Strike the band up, 1, 2, 3
You can't spell "awesome" without "me"
You're the only one of you
Baby, that's the fun of you
And I promise that nobody's gonna love you like me-e-e

[Verse 1]
You are somebody that I don't know
But you're takin' shots at me like it's Patrón
And I'm just like, damn, it's 7 AM
Say it in the street, that's a knock-out
But you say it in a Tweet, that's a cop-out
And I'm just like, "Hey, are you okay?"

[Pre-Chorus]
And I ain't tryna mess with your self-expression
But I've learned a lesson that stressin' and obsessin' 'bout somebody else is no fun
And snakes and stones never broke my bones

[Chorus]
So oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
You need to calm down, you're being too loud
And I'm just like oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh (Oh)
You need to just stop, like can you just not step on my gown?
You need to calm down

[Verse 2]
You are somebody that we don't know
But you're comin' at my friends like a missile
Why are you mad when you could be GLAAD? (You could be GLAAD)
Sunshine on the street at the parade
But you would rather be in the dark ages
Makin' that sign must've taken all night

[Pre-Chorus]
You just need to take several seats and then try to restore the peace
And control your urges to scream about all the people you hate
'Cause shade never made anybody less gay

[Chorus]
So oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
You need to calm down, you're being too loud
And I'm just like oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh (Oh)
You need to just stop, like can you just not step on his gown?
You need to calm down

[Bridge]
And we see you over there on the internet
Comparing all the girls who are killing it
But we figured you out
We all know now we all got crowns
You need to calm down

[Chorus]
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
You need to calm down (You need to calm down)
You're being too loud (You're being too loud)
And I'm just like oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh (Oh)
You need to just stop (Can you stop?)
Like can you just not step on our gowns?
You need to calm down

[Verse 1]
Knew he was a killer first time that I saw him
Wondered how many girls he had loved and left haunted
But if he's a ghost, then I can be a phantom
Holdin' him for ransom, some
Some boys are tryin' too hard, he don't try at all though
Younger than my exes, but he act like such a man, so
I see nothing better, I keep him forever
Like a vendetta-ta

[Pre-Chorus]
I, I, I see how this is gon' go
Touch me and you'll never be alone
I-Island breeze and lights down low
No one has to know

[Chorus]
In the middle of the night, in my dreams
You should see the things we do, baby
In the middle of the night, in my dreams
I know I'm gonna be with you, so I take my time
Are you ready for it?

[Verse 2]
Knew I was a robber first time that he saw me
Stealing hearts and running off and never sayin' sorry
But if I'm a thief, then he can join the heist, and
We'll move to an island, and
And he can be my jailer, Burton to this Taylor
Every love I've known in comparison is a failure
I forget their names now, I'm so very tame now
Never be the same now, now

[Pre-Chorus]
I, I, I see how this is gon' go
Touch me and you'll never be alone
I-Island breeze and lights down low
No one has to know (No one has to know)

[Chorus]
In the middle of the night, in my dreams
You should see the things we do, baby
In the middle of the night in my dreams
I know I'm gonna be with you, so I take my time
Are you ready for it?
Oh, are you ready for it?

[Post-Chorus]
Baby, let the games begin
Let the games begin
Let the games begin
Baby, let the games begin
Let the games begin
Let the games begin

[Pre-Chorus]
I, I, I see how this is gon' go
Touch me and you'll never be alone
I-Island breeze and lights down low
No one has to know

[Chorus]
In the middle of the night (Night), in my dreams (My dreams)
You should see the things we do (We do), baby (Baby), hmm (Eh)
In the middle of the night, in my dreams (My dreams)
I know I'm gonna be with you (I know I'm gonna be with you)
So I take my time
In the middle of the night

[Post-Chorus]
Baby, let the games begin
Let the games begin
Let the games begin
Are you ready for it?
Baby, let the games begin
Let the games begin
Let the games begin
Are you ready for it?

[Verse 1]
Nice to meet you, where you been?
I could show you incredible things
Magic, madness, heaven, sin
Saw you there, and I thought
"Oh my God, look at that face
You look like my next mistake
Love's a game, wanna play?"
Ayy

[Verse 2]
New money, suit and tie
I can read you like a magazine
Ain't it funny? Rumors fly
And I know you heard about me
So hey, let's be friends
I'm dyin' to see how this one ends
Grab your passport and my hand
I can make the bad guys good for a weekend

[Chorus]
So it's gonna be forever
Or it's gonna go down in flames
You can tell me when it's over, mm
If the high was worth the pain
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
'Cause you know I love the players
And you love the game
'Cause we're young and we're reckless
We'll take this way too far
It'll leave you breathless, hmm
Or with a nasty scar
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
But I've got a blank space, baby
And I'll write your name

[Verse 3]
Cherry lips, crystal skies
I could show you incredible things
Stolen kisses, pretty lies
You're the King, baby, I'm your Queen
Find out what you want
Be that girl for a month
Wait, the worst is yet to come
Oh, no

[Verse 4]
Screaming, crying, perfect storms
I can make all the tables turn
Rose garden filled with thorns
Keep you second guessin' like
"Oh my God, who is she?"
I get drunk on jealousy
But you'll come back each time you leave
'Cause, darling, I'm a nightmare dressed like a daydream

[Chorus]
So it's gonna be forever
Or it's gonna go down in flames
You can tell me when it's over, mm
If the high was worth the pain
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
'Cause you know I love the players
And you love the game
'Cause we're young and we're reckless
We'll take this way too far
It'll leave you breathless, hmm
Or with a nasty scar
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
But I've got a blank space, baby
And I'll write your name

[Bridge]
Boys only want love if it's torture
Don't say I didn't, say I didn't warn ya
Boys only want love if it's torture
Don't say I didn't, say I didn't warn ya

[Chorus]
So it's gonna be forever
Or it's gonna go down in flames
You can tell me when it's over, mm
If the high was worth the pain
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
'Cause you know I love the players
And you love the game
'Cause we're young and we're reckless
We'll take this way too far
It'll leave you breathless, hmm
Or with a nasty scar
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
But I've got a blank space, baby
And I'll write your name

[Verse 1]
My castle crumbled overnight
I brought a knife to a gunfight
They took the crown, but it's alright
All the liars are calling me one
Nobody's heard from me for months
I'm doin' better than I ever was
'Cause

[Chorus]
My baby's fit like a daydream
Walking with his head down
I'm the one he's walking to
So call it what you want, yeah
Call it what you want to
My baby's fly like a jet stream
High above the whole scene
Loves me like I'm brand new
So call it what you want, yeah
Call it what you want to

[Verse 2]
All my flowers grew back as thorns
Windows boarded up after the storm
He built a fire just to keep me warm
All the drama queens taking swings
All the jokers dressing up as kings
They fade to nothing when I look at him
And I know I make the same mistakes every time
Bridges burn, I never learn
At least I did one thing right
I did one thing right
I'm laughing with my lover, makin' forts under covers
Trust him like a brother
Yeah, you know I did one thing right
Starry eyes sparkin' up my darkest night

[Chorus]
My baby's fit like a daydream
Walking with his head down
I'm the one he's walking to
So call it what you want, yeah
Call it what you want to
My baby's fly like a jet stream
High above the whole scene
Loves me like I'm brand new
(Call it what you want, call it what you want, call it)
So call it what you want, yeah
Call it what you want to

[Bridge]
I want to wear his initial on a chain 'round my neck
Chain 'round my neck
Not because he owns me
But 'cause he really knows me
Which is more than they can say, I
I recall late November
Holding my breath, slowly, I said
"You don't need to save me
But would you run away with me?"
Yes (Would you run away?)

[Chorus]
My baby's fit like a daydream
Walking with his head down
I'm the one he's walking to
(Call it what you want, call it what you want, call it)
So call it what you want, yeah
Call it what you want to
My baby's fly like a jet stream
High above the whole scene
Loves me like I'm brand new
(Call it what you want, call it what you want, call it)
So call it what you want, yeah
Call it what you want to

[Outro]
(Call it what you want, call it)
(Call it what you want, call it what you want, call it)
(Call it what you want, call it what you want, call it)
(Call it what you want, call it what you want, call it)
(Call it what you want, call it what you want, call it)
(Call it what you want, call it what you want, call it)
(Call it what you want, call it what you want, call it)
Call it what you want, yeah
Call it what you want… to

[Intro]
This ain't for the best
My reputation's never been worse, so
You must like me for me…
We can't make
Any promises now, can we, babe?
But you can make me a drink

[Verse 1]
Dive bar on the East Side, where you at?
Phone lights up my nightstand in the black
Come here, you can meet me in the back
Dark jeans and your Nikes, look at you
Oh damn, never seen that color blue
Just think of the fun things we could do
'Cause I like you

[Pre-Chorus]
This ain't for the best
My reputation's never been worse, so
You must like me for me…
Yeah, I want you
We can't make
Any promises now, can we, babe?
But you can make me a drink

[Chorus]
Is it cool that I said all that?
Is it chill that you're in my head?
'Cause I know that it's delicate (Delicate)
Is it cool that I said all that?
Is it too soon to do this yet?
'Cause I know that it's delicate
Isn't it? Isn't it? Isn't it?
Isn't it?
Isn't it? Isn't it? Isn't it?
Isn't it... delicate?

[Verse 2]
Third floor on the West Side, me and you
Handsome, you're a mansion with a view
Do the girls back home touch you like I do?
Long night, with your hands up in my hair
Echoes of your footsteps on the stairs
Stay here, honey, I don't wanna share
'Cause I like you

[Pre-Chorus]
This ain't for the best
My reputation's never been worse, so
You must like me for me…
Yeah, I want you...
We can't make
Any promises now, can we, babe?
But you can make me a drink

[Chorus]
Is it cool that I said all that?
Is it chill that you're in my head?
'Cause I know that it's delicate (Delicate)
Is it cool that I said all that?
Is it too soon to do this yet?
'Cause I know that it's delicate
Isn't it? Isn't it? Isn't it?
Isn't it?
Isn't it? Isn't it? Isn't it?
Isn't it delicate?

[Bridge]
Sometimes I wonder when you sleep
Are you ever dreaming of me?
Sometimes when I look into your eyes
I pretend you're mine, all the damn time
'Cause I like you

[Chorus]
Is it cool that I said all that?
Is it chill that you're in my head?
'Cause I know that it's delicate (Delicate)
(Yeah, I want you)
Is it cool that I said all that?
Is it too soon to do this yet?
'Cause I know that it's delicate (Delicate)
'Cause I like you
Is it cool that I said all that?
Isn't it? Isn't it? Isn't it? Isn't it?
Is it chill that you're in my head?
Isn't it? Isn't it? Isn't it? Isn't it?
'Cause I know that it's delicate
Isn't it? Isn't it? Isn't it? Isn't it?
(Yeah, I want you)
Is it cool that I said all that?
Isn't it? Isn't it? Isn't it? Isn't it?
Is it too soon to do this yet?
Isn't it? Isn't it? Isn't it?
'Cause I know that it's delicate
Isn't it delicate?

[Verse 1]
Midnight
You come and pick me up, no headlights
Long drive
Could end in burning flames or paradise
Fade into view, oh
It's been a while since I have even heard from you
(Heard from you)
And I should just tell you to leave, 'cause I
Know exactly where it leads, but I
Watch us go 'round and 'round each time

[Chorus]
You got that James Dean daydream look in your eye
And I got that red lip classic thing that you like
And when we go crashing down, we come back every time
'Cause we never go out of style, we never go out of style
You got that long hair, slicked back, white t-shirt
And I got that good girl faith and a tight little skirt
And when we go crashing down, we come back every time
'Cause we never go out of style, we never go out of style

[Verse 2]
So it goes
He can't keep his wild eyes on the road (Mmm)
Takes me home
The lights are off, he's taking off his coat (Mmm, yeah)
I say, "I heard, oh
That you've been out and about with some other girl"
Some other girl
He says, "What you heard is true, but I
Can't stop thinking 'bout you," and I
I said, "I've been there too a few times"

[Chorus]
'Cause you got that James Dean daydream look in your eye
And I got that red lip classic thing that you like
And when we go crashing down, we come back every time
'Cause we never go out of style, we never go out of style
You got that long hair, slicked back, white t-shirt
And I got that good girl faith and a tight little skirt
(A tight little skirt)
And when we go crashing down, we come back every time
'Cause we never go out of style (we never go, we never go)
We never go out of style

[Bridge]
Take me home
Just take me home
Yeah, just take me home
Oh-oh, whoa-oh, oh
(Out of style)

[Chorus]
Oh, you got that James Dean daydream look in your eye
And I got that red lip classic thing that you like
And when we go crashing down (And when we go)
We come back every time
'Cause we never go out of style, we never go out of style

[Intro]
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)

[Verse 1]
Fever dream high in the quiet of the night
You know that I caught it (Oh yeah, you're right, I want it)
Bad, bad boy, shiny toy with a price
You know that I bought it (Oh yeah, you're right, I want it)

[Pre-Chorus]
Killing me slow, out the window
I'm always waiting for you to be waiting below
Devils roll the dice, angels roll their eyes
What doesn't kill me makes me want you more

[Chorus]
And it's new, the shape of your body
It's blue, the feeling I've got
And it's ooh, whoa oh
It's a cruel summer
It's cool, that's what I tell 'em
No rules in breakable heaven
But ooh, whoa oh
It's a cruel summer
With you

[Verse 2]
Hang your head low in the glow of the vending machine
I'm not dying (Oh yeah, you're right, I want it)
We say that we'll just screw it up in these trying times
We're not trying (Oh yeah, you're right, I want it)

[Pre-Chorus 2]
So cut the headlights, summer's a knife
I'm always waiting for you just to cut to the bone
Devils roll the dice, angels roll their eyes
And if I bleed, you'll be the last to know

[Chorus]
Oh, it's new, the shape of your body
It's blue, the feeling I've got
And it's ooh, whoa oh
It's a cruel summer
It's cool, that's what I tell 'em
No rules in breakable heaven
But ooh, whoa oh
It's a cruel summer
With you

[Bridge]
I'm drunk in the back of the car
And I cried like a baby coming home from the bar (Oh)
Said, "I'm fine," but it wasn't true
I don't wanna keep secrets just to keep you
And I snuck in through the garden gate
Every night that summer just to seal my fate (Oh)
And I scream, "For whatever it's worth
I love you, ain't that the worst thing you ever heard?"
He looks up, grinning like a devil

[Chorus]
It's new, the shape of your body
It's blue, the feeling I've got
And it's ooh, whoa oh
It's a cruel summer
It's cool, that's what I tell 'em
No rules in breakable heaven
But ooh, whoa oh
It's a cruel summer
With you

[Outro]
I'm drunk in the back of the car
And I cried like a baby coming home from the bar (Oh)
Said, "I'm fine," but it wasn't true
I don't wanna keep secrets just to keep you
And I snuck in through the garden gate
Every night that summer just to seal my fate (Oh)
And I scream, "For whatever it's worth
I love you, ain't that the worst thing you ever heard?"
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)

[Intro]
Gorgeous

[Verse 1]
You should take it as a compliment
That I got drunk and made fun of the way you talk
You should think about the consequence
Of your magnetic field being a little too strong
And I got a boyfriend, he's older than us
He's in the club doin' I don't know what
You're so cool, it makes me hate you so much
(I hate you so much)

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Whisky on ice, Sunset and Vine
You've ruined my life by not being mine

[Chorus]
You're so gorgeous
I can't say anything to your face
'Cause look at your face
And I'm so furious
At you for making me feel this way
But what can I say?
You're gorgeous

[Verse 2]
You should take it as a compliment
That I'm talking to everyone here but you (But you, but you)
And you should think about the consequence
Of you touching my hand in a darkened room (Dark room, dark room)
If you've got a girlfriend, I'm jealous of her
But if you're single that's honestly worse
'Cause you're so gorgeous it actually hurts (Honey, it hurts)

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Ocean blue eyes looking in mine
I feel like I might sink and drown and die

[Chorus]
You're so gorgeous
I can't say anything to your face (To your face)
'Cause look at your face (Look at your face, gorgeous)
And I'm so furious
At you for making me feel this way (Feel this way)
But what can I say?
You're gorgeous

[Bridge]
You make me so happy it turns back to sad
There's nothing I hate more than what I can't have
And you are so gorgeous it makes me so mad (Mmh)
You make me so happy it turns back to sad (Yeah)
There's nothing I hate more than what I can't have and
Guess I'll just stumble on home to my cats (Yeugh), alone
Unless, you wanna come along? (Oh)

[Chorus]
You're so gorgeous
I can't say anything to your face (To your face)
'Cause look at your face (Look at your face)
And I'm so furious (I'm so furious)
At you for making me feel this way (Feel this way)
But what can I say? (I say)
You're gorgeous

[Outro]
You make me so happy it turns back to sad (Yeah)
There's nothing I hate more than what I can't have
And you are so gorgeous it makes me so mad (Mmh)
You're gorgeous
You make me so happy it turns back to sad (It turns back to sad)
There's nothing I hate more than what I can't have (What I can have)
You are so gorgeous it makes me so mad (Mmh)
You're gorgeous

[Chorus]
Don't blame me, love made me crazy
If it doesn't, you ain't doin' it right
Lord, save me, my drug is my baby
I'll be usin' for the rest of my life

[Verse 1]
I've been breakin' hearts a long time
And toyin' with them older guys
Just playthings for me to use
Something happened for the first time
In the darkest little paradise
Shakin', pacin', I just need you

[Pre-Chorus]
For you, I would cross the line
I would waste my time
I would lose my mind
They say, "She's gone too far this time"

[Chorus]
Don't blame me, love made me crazy
If it doesn't, you ain't doin' it right
Lord, save me, my drug is my baby
I'll be usin' for the rest of my life
Don't blame me, love made me crazy
If it doesn't, you ain't doin' it right
Oh, Lord, save me, my drug is my baby
I'll be usin' for the rest of my life

[Verse 2]
My name is whatever you decide
And I'm just gonna call you mine
I'm insane, but I'm your baby (Your baby)
Echoes of your name inside my mind
Halo hiding my obsession
I once was poison ivy, but now I'm your daisy

[Pre-Chorus 2]
And baby, for you, I would fall from grace
Just to touch your face
If you walk away, I'd beg you on my knees to stay

[Chorus]
Don't blame me, love made me crazy
If it doesn't, you ain't doin' it right
Lord, save me, my drug is my baby
I'll be usin' for the rest of my life
Don't blame me, love made me crazy
If it doesn't, you ain't doin' it right
Oh, Lord, save me, my drug is my baby
I'll be usin' for the rest of my life

[Bridge]
I get so high, oh!
Every time you're, every time you're lovin' me
You're lovin' me
Trip of my life, oh!
Every time you're, every time you're touchin' me
You're touchin' me
Every time you're, every time you're lovin' me
Oh, Lord, save me
My drug is my baby
I'll be usin' for the rest of my life
(Usin' for the rest of my life, oh-whoah-oh-oh)

[Chorus]
Don't blame me, love made me crazy
If it doesn't, you ain't doin' it right (Doin' it right, no)
Lord, save me, my drug is my baby
I'll be usin' for the rest of my life, oh-oh
Don't blame me, love made me crazy (Oh-oh-oh)
If it doesn't, you ain't doin' it right (You ain't doin' it right)
Oh, Lord, save me, my drug is my baby
I'll be usin' for the rest of my life (I'll be usin', I'll be usin')

[Outro]
I get so high, oh!
Every time you're, every time you're lovin' me
You're lovin' me
Oh, Lord, save me, my drug is my baby
I'll be usin' for the rest of my life

[Verse 1]
I never trust a narcissist, but they love me
So I play 'em like a violin
And I make it look oh-so-easy
'Cause for every lie I tell them, they tell me three
This is how the world works
Now all he thinks about is me

[Pre-Chorus 1]
I can feel the flames on my skin
Crimson red paint on my lips
If a man talks shit, then I owe him nothing
I don't regret it one bit, 'cause he had it coming

[Chorus]
They say I did something bad
Then why's it feel so good?
They say I did something bad
But why's it feel so good?
Most fun I ever had
And I'd do it over and over and over again if I could
It just felt so good, good

[Hook]
Ra-di-di-di-di-di-di-di-di-di-da-da
Ra-di-di-di-di-di-di-di-di-di-da-da
Ra-di-di-di-di-di-di-di-di-di-da-da
Da-da da-da

[Verse 2]
I never trust a playboy, but they love me
So I fly 'em all around the world
And I let them think they saved me
They never see it comin', what I do next
This is how the world works
You gotta leave before you get left

[Pre-Chorus 2]
I can feel the flames on my skin
He says, "Don't throw away a good thing"
But if he drops my name, then I owe him nothin'
And if he spends my change, then he had it comin'

[Chorus]
They say I did something bad(oh)
Then why's it feel so good?
They say I did something bad
But why's it feel so good?
Most fun I ever had
And I'd do it over and over and over again if I could
It just felt so good, good

[Hook]
Ra-di-di-di-di-di-di-di-di-di-da-da
Ra-di-di-di-di-di-di-di-di-di-da-da
(It just felt so good)
Ra-di-di-di-di-di-di-di-di-di-da-da
Da-da da-da

[Bridge]
They're burning all the witches even if you aren't one
They got their pitchforks and proof, their receipts and reasons
They're burning all the witches even if you aren't one
So light me up (Light me up), light me up (Light me up)
Light me up, go ahead and light me up (Light me up)
Light me up (Light me up), light me up (Light me up)
Light me up (Light me up), light me up

[Chorus]
They say I did something bad
Then why's it feel so good?
They say I did something bad
But why's it feel so good?
Most fun I ever had
And I'd do it over and over and over again if I could
It just felt so good, good

[Hook]
Ra-di-di-di-di-di-di-di-di-di-da-da
Ra-di-di-di-di-di-di-di-di-di-da-da
Ra-di-di-di-di-di-di-di-di-di-da-da
Da-da da-da

[Outro]
Oh, you say I did something bad
(You say I did something bad?)
Why's it feel so good, good?
So bad, why's it feel so good?
Why's it feel, why's it feel so good? (Bad)
It just felt so good, good

[Verse 1]
I would be complex, I would be cool
They'd say I played the field before I found someone to commit to
And that would be okay for me to do
Every conquest I had made would make me more of a boss to you

[Pre-Chorus]
I’d be a fearless leader
I'd be an alpha type
When everyone believes ya
What's that like?

[Chorus]
I’m so sick of running as fast as I can
Wondering if I'd get there quicker if I was a man
And I'm so sick of them coming at me again
'Cause if I was a man, then I'd be the man
I'd be the man
I'd be the man

[Verse 2]
They'd say I hustled, put in the work
They wouldn’t shake their heads and question how much of this I deserve
What I was wearing, if I was rude
Could all be separated from my good ideas and power moves

[Pre-Chorus]
And they would toast to me, oh, let the players play
I’d be just like Leo in Saint-Tropez

[Chorus]
I'm so sick of running as fast as I can
Wondering if I’d get there quicker if I was a man
And I'm so sick of them coming at me again
'Cause if I was a man, then I'd be the man
I’d be the man
I'd be the man

[Bridge]
What's it like to brag about raking in dollars
And getting bitches and models?
And it's all good if you're bad
And it's okay if you're mad
If I was out flashing my dollars
I'd be a bitch, not a baller
They'd paint me out to be bad
So, it's okay that I'm mad

[Chorus]
I'm so sick of running as fast as I can
Wondering if I'd get there quicker if I was a man (You know that)
And I'm so sick of them coming at me again (Coming at me again)
'Cause if I was a man (If I was a man)
Then I'd be the man (Then I'd be the man)
I'm so sick of running as fast as I can (As fast as I can)
Wondering if I'd get there quicker if I was a man (Hey)
And I'm so sick of them coming at me again (Coming at me again)
'Cause if I was a man (If I was a man), then I'd be the man
I'd be the man
I'd be the man (Oh)
I'd be the man (Yeah)
I'd be the man (I'd be the man)

[Outro]
If I was a man, then I'd be the man

[Verse 1]
Our secret moments in a crowded room
They got no idea about me and you
There is an indentation in the shape of you
Made your mark on me, a golden tattoo

[Pre-Chorus]
All of this silence and patience, pining and anticipation
My hands are shaking from holding back from you
Ha, ah, ah
All of this silence and patience, pining and desperately waiting
My hands are shaking from all this
Ah, ha, ha, ha-ah

[Chorus]
Say my name and everything just stops
I don't want you like a best friend
Only bought this dress so you could take it off
Take it oh, ha, ha, ha-ah
Carve your name into my bedpost
’Cause I don't want you like a best friend
Only bought this dress so you could take it off
Take it oh, ha, ha, ha-ah

[Verse 2]
Inescapable, I'm not even gonna try
And if I get burned, at least we were electrified
I’m spilling wine in the bathtub
You kiss my face and we're both drunk
Everyone thinks that they know us
But they know nothing about—

[Pre-Chorus]
All of this silence and patience, pining and anticipation
My hands are shaking from holding back from you
Ha, ah, ah
All of this silence and patience, pining and desperately waiting
My hands are shaking from all this
Ah, ha, ha, ha-ah

[Chorus]
Say my name and everything just stops
I don't want you like a best friend
Only bought this dress so you could take it off
Take it oh, ha, ha, ha-ah
Carve your name into my bedpost
'Cause I don't want you like a best friend
Only bought this dress so you could take it off
Take it oh, ha, ha...

[Post-Chorus]
Ha-ah-ah, ha-ah-ah, ha-ah-ah-ah
Only bought this dress so you could take it off
Ha-ah-ah, ha-ah-ah, ha-ah-ah-ah
Only bought this dress so you could take it off

[Bridge]
Flashback when you met me
Your buzzcut and my hair bleached
Even in my worst times, you could see the best in me
Flashback to my mistakes
My rebounds, my earthquakes
Even in my worst lies, you saw the truth in me
And I woke up just in time
Now I wake up by your side
My one and only, my lifeline
I woke up just in time
Now I wake up by your side
My hands shake, I can't explain this
Ah, ha, ha, ha-ah

[Chorus]
Say my name and everything just stops...
I don't want you like a best friend
Only bought this dress so you could take it off
Take it oh, ha, ha, ha-ah
Carve your name into my bedpost
'Cause I don’t want you like a best friend
Only bought this dress so you could take it off
Take it oh, ha, ha, ha-ah

[Outro]
There is an indentation in the shape of you
Only bought this dress so you could take it off
You made your mark on me, golden tattoo
Only bought this dress so you could take it off

[Verse 1]
Combat, I'm ready for combat
I say I don't want that, but what if I do?
'Cause cruelty wins in the movies
I've got a hundred thrown-out speeches I almost said to you

[Pre-Chorus]
Easy they come, easy they go
I jump from the train, I ride off alone
I never grew up, it's getting so old
Help me hold on to you

[Chorus]
I've been the archer, I've been the prey
Who could ever leave me, darling
But who could stay?

[Verse 2]
Dark side, I search for your dark side
But what if I'm alright, right, right, right here?
And I cut off my nose just to spite my face
Then I hate my reflection for years and years

[Pre-Chorus]
I wake in the night, I pace like a ghost
The room is on fire, invisible smoke
And all of my heroes die all alone
Help me hold on to you

[Chorus]
I've been the archer, I've been the prey
Screaming, who could ever leave me, darling
But who could stay?
(I see right through me, I see right through me)

[Bridge]
'Cause they see right through me
They see right through me
They see right through
Can you see right through me?
They see right through
They see right through me
I see right through me
I see right through me

[Pre-Chorus]
All the king's horses, all the king's men
Couldn't put me together again
'Cause all of my enemies started out friends
Help me hold on to you

[Chorus]
I've been the archer, I've been the prey
Who could ever leave me, darling
But who could stay?
(I see right through me, I see right through me)
Who could stay?
Who could stay?
Who could stay?
You could stay
You could stay

[Outro]
Combat, I'm ready for combat

[Chorus]
’Cause baby, now we've got bad blood
You know it used to be mad love
So take a look what you've done
’Cause baby, now we've got bad blood, hey!
Now we've got problems
And I don't think we can solve 'em
You made a really deep cut
And baby, now we've got bad blood, hey!

[Verse 1]
Did you have to do this?
I was thinking that you could be trusted
Did you have to ruin what was shiny?
Now it's all rusted
Did you have to hit me where I'm weak?
Baby, I couldn't breathe
And rub it in so deep
Salt in the wound like you're laughing right at me

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, it's so sad to
Think about the good times
You and I

[Chorus]
’Cause baby, now we've got bad blood
You know it used to be mad love
So take a look what you've done
’Cause baby, now we've got bad blood, hey!
Now we've got problems
And I don't think we can solve 'em
You made a really deep cut
And baby, now we've got bad blood, hey!

[Verse 2]
Did you think we'd be fine?
Still got scars in my back from your knives
So don't think it's in the past
These kinds of wounds they last and they last
Now, did you think it all through?
All these things will catch up to you
And time can heal, but this won't
So if you're coming my way
Just don't

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, it's so sad to
Think about the good times
You and I

[Chorus]
’Cause baby, now we've got bad blood
You know it used to be mad love
So take a look what you've done
’Cause baby, now we've got bad blood, hey!
Now we've got problems
And I don't think we can solve 'em
You made a really deep cut
And baby, now we've got bad blood, hey!

[Bridge]
Band-aids don't fix bullet holes
You say sorry just for show
If you live like that, you live with ghosts
Band-aids don't fix bullet holes
You say sorry just for show
If you live like that, you live with ghosts
If you love like that, blood runs cold!

[Chorus]
’Cause baby, now we've got bad blood
You know it used to be mad love
So take a look what you've done
’Cause baby, now we've got bad blood, hey!
Now we've got problems
And I don't think we can solve 'em (Think we can solve 'em)
You made a really deep cut
And baby, now we've got bad blood, hey!

[Chorus]
’Cause baby, now we've got bad blood
You know it used to be mad love
So take a look what you've done (Look what you've done)
’Cause baby, now we've got bad blood, hey!
Now we've got problems
And I don't think we can solve 'em
You made a really deep cut
And baby, now we've got bad blood, hey!

[Verse 1]
You know I adore you, I'm crazier for you
Than I was at 16, lost in a film scene
Waving homecoming queens, marching band playing
I'm lost in the lights
American glory faded before me
Now I'm feeling hopeless, ripped up my prom dress
Running through rose thorns, I saw the scoreboard
And ran for my life (Ah)

[Pre-Chorus]
No cameras catch my pageant smile
I counted days, I counted miles
To see you there, to see you there
It's been a long time coming, but

[Chorus]
It's you and me, that's my whole world
They whisper in the hallway, "She's a bad, bad girl" (Okay)
The whole school is rolling fake dice
You play stupid games, you win stupid prizes
It's you and me, there's nothing like this
Miss Americana and The Heartbreak Prince (Okay)
We're so sad, we paint the town blue
Voted most likely to run away with you

[Verse 2]
My team is losing, battered and bruising
I see the high fives between the bad guys
Leave with my head hung, you are the only one
Who seems to care
American stories burning before me
I'm feeling helpless, the damsels are depressed
Boys will be boys then, where are the wise men?
Darling, I'm scared (Ah)

[Pre-Chorus 2]
No cameras catch my muffled cries
I counted days, I counted miles
To see you there, to see you there
And now the storm is coming, but

[Chorus]
It's you and me, that's my whole world
They whisper in the hallway, "She's a bad, bad girl" (Okay)
The whole school is rolling fake dice
You play stupid games, you win stupid prizes
It's you and me, there's nothing like this
Miss Americana and The Heartbreak Prince (Okay)
We're so sad, we paint the town blue
Voted most likely to run away with you

[Bridge]
And I don't want you to (Go), I don't really wanna (Fight)
'Cause nobody's gonna (Win), I think you should come home
And I don't want you to (Go), I don't really wanna (Fight)
'Cause nobody's gonna (Win), I think you should come home
And I don't want you to (Go), I don't really wanna (Fight)
'Cause nobody's gonna (Win), just thought you should know
And I'll never let you (Go) 'cause I know this is a (Fight)
That someday we're gonna (Win)

[Chorus]
It's you and me, that's my whole world
They whisper in the hallway, "She's a bad, bad girl"
Oh, I just thought you should know (You should know)
It's you and me, there's nothing like this (Like this)
Miss Americana and The Heartbreak Prince (Okay)
We're so sad, we paint the town blue (Paint it blue)
Voted most likely to run away with you

[Post-Chorus]
And I don't want you to (Go), I don't really wanna (Fight)
'Cause nobody's gonna (Win), I think you should come home
And I'll never let you (Go) 'cause I know this is a (Fight)
That someday we're gonna (Win), just thought you should know

[Outro]
It's you and me, that's my whole world
They whisper in the hallway, "She's a bad, bad girl"
"She's a bad, bad girl"

[Intro: Idris Elba & James Corden]
We can go driving in, on my scooter
Uh, you know, just 'round London
Oh, I'd...

[Verse 1]
I love my hometown as much as Motown, I love SoCal
And you know I love Springsteen, faded blue jeans, Tennessee whiskey
But something happened, I heard him laughing
I saw the dimples first and then I heard the accent
They say home is where the heart is
But that's not where mine lives

[Chorus]
You know I love a London boy
I enjoy walking Camden Market in the afternoon
He likes my American smile, like a child when our eyes meet
Darling, I fancy you
Took me back to Highgate, met all of his best mates
So I guess all the rumors are true
You know I love a London boy
Boy, I fancy you (Ooh)

[Verse 2]
And now I love high tea, stories from Uni, and the West End
You can find me in the pub, we are watching rugby with his school friends
Show me a gray sky, a rainy cab ride
Babes, don't threaten me with a good time
They say home is where the heart is
But God, I love the English

[Chorus]
You know I love a London boy, I enjoy nights in Brixton
Shoreditch in the afternoon
He likes my American smile, like a child when our eyes meet
Darling, I fancy you
Took me back to Highgate, met all of his best mates
So I guess all the rumors are true
You know I love a London boy
Boy, I fancy you

[Bridge]
So please show me Hackney
Doesn't have to be Louis V up on Bond Street
Just wanna be with you
Wanna be with you
Stick with me, I'm your queen
Like a Tennessee Stella McCartney on the Heath
Just wanna be with you (Wanna be with you)
Wanna be with you (Oh)

[Chorus]
You know I love a London boy, I enjoy walking Soho
Drinking in the afternoon (Yeah)
He likes my American smile, like a child when our eyes meet
Darling, I fancy you (You)
Took me back to Highgate, met all of his best mates
So I guess all the rumors are true (Yeah)
You know I love a London boy (Oh)
Boy (Oh), I fancy you (I fancy you, ooh)

[Outro]
So please show me Hackney
Doesn't have to be Louis V up on Bond Street
Just wanna be with you
I, I, I fancy you
Oh whoa, oh, I
Stick with me, I'm your queen
Like a Tennessee Stella McCartney on the Heath
Just wanna be with you (Ooh)
Wanna be with you
I fancy you (Yeah), I fancy you
Oh whoa, ah

Something that I never had
Something that you've never seen
Something that you've never been!

We just need to slow the motion
Don't give that away to no one
Long distance, I need you
When I see potential I just gotta see it through
If you had a twin, I would still choose you
I don't wanna rush into it, if it's too soon
But I know you need to get done, done, done, done
If you come over
Sorry if I'm way less friendly
I got niggas tryna end me, oh
I spilled all my emotions tonight, I’m sorry
Rollin', rollin', rollin', rollin', rollin'
How many more shots until you're rollin'?
We just need a face to face
You could pick the time and the place
You spent some time away

[Intro: YG]
Mustard on the beat, ho!

[Verse 1]
I was good on my own, that's the way it was
That's the way it was
You was good on the low for a faded fuck
On some faded love
Shit, what the fuck you complaining for?
Feeling jaded, huh?
Used to trip off that shit I was kickin' to you
Had some fun on the run though I'll give it to you

[Pre-Chorus]
But baby, don't get it twisted
You was just another nigga on the hit list
Tryna fix your inner issues with a bad bitch
Didn't they tell you that I was a savage?
Fuck ya white horse and ya carriage
Bet you never could imagine
Never told you you could have it

[Chorus]
You needed me
Ooh, you needed me
To feel a little more, and give a little less
Know you hate to confess
But baby ooh, you needed me

[Verse 2]
You been rollin' around, shit I'm rollin' up
Light and roll it up
Break it down, like a pound, shit was never us
Shit was never us
That's the real, on the real, are you serious?
How you feel, how you feel?
Used to trip off that shit I was kickin' to ya
Had some fun on the run though, I'll give it to ya

[Pre-Chorus]
But baby, don't get it twisted
You was just another nigga on the hit list
Tryna fix your inner issues with a bad bitch
Didn't they tell you that I was a savage?
Fuck ya white horse and ya carriage
Bet you never could imagine
Never told you you could have it

[Chorus]
You needed me
Ooh, you needed me
To feel a little more, and give a little less
Know you hate to confess
But baby ooh, you needed me

[Verse 1]
And you got me like, "Oh, what you want from me?"
(What you want from me?)
And I tried to buy your pretty heart, but the price too high
Baby, you got me like "Oh"
You love when I fall apart (fall apart)
So you can put me together and throw me against the wall

[Pre-Chorus]
Baby you got me like i-i-i-i-i-i-i-i-i-hiii, woo i-i-i-i-i-i-i-i-i-hiii
Don't you stop loving me (loving me)

Just start loving me (loving me)
Owwwwww

[Chorus]
And babe I’m fist-fighting with fire
Just to get close to you
Can we burn something babe
And I run for miles just to get a taste
Must be love on the brain
That’s got me feeling this way
It beats me black and blue but it fucks me so good
And I can’t get enough
Must be love on the brain yeah
And it keeps cursing my name
No matter what I do
I’m no good without you
And I can’t get enough
Must be love on the..... brain

[Verse 2]
Baby keep loving me
Just love me
Yeah, just love me
All you need to do is love me, yeah
Got me like, ah-ha-ha-owww
I’m tired of being played like a violin
What do I gotta do to get in your motherfuckin’ heart?
Baby like i-i-i-i-i-i-i-i-i-hiii, woo i-i-i-i-i-i-i-i-i-hiii

[Pre-Chorus]
Baby you got me like i-i-i-i-i-i-i-i-i-hiii, woo i-i-i-i-i-i-i-i-i-hiii
Don't you stop loving me (loving me)
Don't quit loving me (loving me)
Just start loving me (loving me)
Ooooooohhh

[Chorus]
And babe I’m fist-fighting with fire
Just to get close to you
Can we burn something babe
And I run for miles just to get a taste
Must be love on the brain
That’s got me feeling this way
It beats me black and blue but it fucks me so good
And I can’t get enough
Must be love on the brain yeah
And it keeps cursing my name
No matter what I do
I’m no good without you
And I can’t get enough
Must be love on the.... brain

[Verse 1: Rihanna]
All along it was a fever
A cold sweat, hot-headed believer
I threw my hands in the air, said, "Show me something"
He said, “If you dare, come a little closer”

[Pre-Chorus: Rihanna]
Round and around and around and around we go
Oh now, tell me now, tell me now, tell me now you know

[Chorus: Rihanna]
Not really sure how to feel about it
Something in the way you move
Makes me feel like I can't live without you
And it takes me all the way
I want you to stay

[Verse 2: Mikky Ekko]
It's not much of a life you're living
It's not just something you take, it's given

Oh, now tell me now, tell me now, tell me now you know

Ooh, the reason I hold on
Ooh, 'cause I need this hole gone
Funny you're the broken one
But I'm the only one who needed saving
'Cause when you never see the light
It's hard to know which one of us is caving

[Chorus: Rihanna & Mikky Ekko]
Not really sure how to feel about it
Something in the way you move
Makes me feel like I can't live without you
And it takes me all the way
I want you to stay

Stay
I want you to stay
Ooh

[Verse 1: Rihanna]
I came fluttering in from Neverland
Time can never stop me, no, no, no, no
I know you've tried to
I came riding in on a pale white horse
Handing out highs to less fortunate
I do advise you
Run it back, run it on back
When you breaking it down for me
Cause I can't hear you, two times
Run it on back, will it ever make sense to me?

[Chorus: Rihanna]
I got to do things my own way darling
Will you ever let me
Will you ever respect me? No
Do things my own way darling
You should just let me
Why you ain't ever let me grow?

When I look outside my window
I can't get no piece of mind
When I look outside my window
I can't get no peace of mind

[Verse 2: Rihanna]
Let me cover your shit in glitter
I could make it gold, gold
Heard you tryna sell your soul, baby
Word on the street, you run it low lately
I needed you to please give my reflection a break
From the face it’s seeing now
Ooh darling, gahhlee
Would you mind giving my reflection a break
From the pain it’s feeling now?

[Chorus: Rihanna & SZA]
I got to do things my own way darling

Mhm, take it easy
I'm not tryna go against yuh
Actually, I'm goin' witcha

[Pre-Chorus]
Gotta get up out of here
And yuh ain't leavin' me behind
I know you won't cause we share common interests
You need me, there ain't no leaving me behind
Never, no, no, I just want outta here, yeah
Once I'm gone, ain’t no going back

[Chorus]
If you want, we can be runaways
Running from any sight of love
Yeah, yeah, there ain’t nothin'
There ain't nothin' here for me
There ain't nothin' here for me anymore
But I don't wanna be alone

[Verse 2]
Desperado
Sitting on your ole' Monte Carlo
We've both had our hearts broke
Unh, hunh, take it easy
I'm not tryna go against yuh
I can be a lone wolf witcha

[Pre-Chorus]
Gotta get up out of here
And you ain't leaving me behind
I know you won't cause we share common interests
You need me, there ain't no leaving me behind
Never, no, no, both want outta here, yeah
Once we're gone, ain’t no going back

[Verse 1]
I can just hear them now
"How could you let us down?"
But they don't know what I found
Or see it from this way around
Feeling it overtake
All that I used to hate
Worried 'bout every trait
I tried but it's way too late
All the signs I don't read
Two sides of me can't agree
When I breathe in too deep
Going with what I always longed for

[Chorus 1]
Feel like a brand new person
(But you make the same old mistakes)
Well, I don’t care I’m in love
(Stop before it’s too late)
Feel like a brand new person
(But you make the same old mistakes)
I finally know what it's like
(You don’t have what it takes)
(Stop before it’s not too late)
(I know there’s too much at stake)
(Making the same mistakes)
And I still don’t know why it’s happening
(Stop while it’s not too late)
And I still don’t know

[Verse 2]
Finally taking flight
I know you don't think it's right
I know that you think it's fake
Maybe fake's what I like
Point is I have the right
Not thinking in black and white
I'm thinking it's worth the fight
Soon to be out of sight
Knowing it all this time
Going with what I always longed for

[Chorus 1]
Feel like a brand new person
(But you make the same old mistakes)
I don’t care I’m in love
(Stop before it’s too late)
Feel like a brand new person
(But you make the same old mistakes)
So how do I know that it's right?
(You don’t have what it takes)
(Stop before it’s not too late)

[Bridge]
And I know that it's hard to digest
But maybe your story ain’t so different from the rest
And I know it seems wrong to accept
But you've got your demons, and she's got her regrets
And I know that it's hard to digest
A realization is as good as it gets
And I know it seems wrong to accept
But you've got your demons, and she's got her regrets
But you've got your demons, and she's got her regrets

[Chorus 2]
Feel like a brand new person
So, how will I know that it's right?
In a new direction
So, how will I know I've gone too far?
(Stop thinking you're the only option, oh)
Feel like a brand new person
(But you make the same old mistakes)
I finally know what it's like
(Stop before it's too late)
(Stop thinking you're the only option, oh)
In a new direction
(But you make the same old mistakes)
So how will I know I've gone too far?
(You don’t have what it takes)
(Stop before it’s too late)
(Stop thinking you're the only option, oh)
Feel like a brand new person
(But you make the same old mistakes)
And I know it's hard to describe
(Stop thinking you're the only option, oh)
(But you make the same old mistakes)
(You don’t have what it takes)
(Stop before it’s too late)
I finally know what it's like
(Stop before it’s too late)
(Stop thinking you're the only option, oh)
(Stop thinking you're the only option, oh)

No clouds in my stones
Let it rain, I hydroplane in the bank
Coming down with the Dow Jones
When the clouds come, we gone, we Roc-A-Fella
We fly higher than weather, in G5's or better
You know me (You know me)
In anticipation for precipitation, stack chips for the rainy day
Jay—Rain Man is back
With Little Miss Sunshine, Rihanna, where you at?

[Verse 2: Rihanna]
You have my heart
And we'll never be worlds apart
Maybe in magazines

You can't see shiny cars
And that's when you need me there
With you, I'll always share
Because

[Chorus: Rihanna]
When the sun shine, we shine together
Told you I'll be here forever
Said I'll always be your friend
Took an oath, I'ma stick it out to the end
Now that it's raining more than ever
Know that we'll still have each other
You can stand under my umbrella
You can stand under my umbrella, ella, ella, eh, eh, eh
Under my umbrella, ella, ella, eh, eh, eh
Under my umbrella, ella, ella, eh, eh, eh
Under my umbrella, ella, ella, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh-eh

[Verse 3: Rihanna]
These fancy things

You're part of my entity
Here for infinity
When the war has took its part
When the world has dealt its cards
If the hand is hard
Together we'll mend your heart
Because

[Chorus: Rihanna]
When the sun shine, we shine together
Told you I'll be here forever
Said I'll always be your friend
Took an oath, I'ma stick it out to the end

So gon' and let the rain pour

Under my umbrella, ella, ella, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh-eh

[Outro: Rihanna]
It's rainin', rainin'
Ooh, baby, it's rainin', rainin'
Baby, come here to me
Come into me
It's rainin', rainin'
Ooh, baby, it's rainin', rainin'
You can always come into me
Come into me
It's pourin' rain
It's pourin' rain
Come here to me
Come into me
It's pourin' rain
It's pourin' rain

[Verse]
This whiskey got me feelin' pretty
So pardon if I'm impolite
I just really need your ass with me
I'm sorry 'bout the other night
And I know I could be more creative
And come up with poetic lines
But I'm turnt up upstairs and I love you
Is the only thing that's in my mind

[Chorus]
You take me higher, higher than I've ever been, babe
Just come over, let's pour a drink, babe
I hope I ain't calling you too late, too late
You light my fire
Let's stay up late and smoke a J
I wanna go back to the old way
But I'm drunk instead, with a full ashtray
With a little bit too much to say

[Verse 1: Rihanna]
On the first page of our story
The future seemed so bright
Then this thing turned out so evil
I don’t know why I’m still surprised
Even angels have their wicked schemes
And you take that to new extremes
But you’ll always be my hero
Even though you’ve lost your mind

[Chorus: Rihanna]
Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
But that’s all right because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
But that’s all right because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
Ohhh, I love the way you lie

[Verse 2: Rihanna]
Now there’s gravel in our voices
Glass is shattered from the fight
In this tug of war, you’ll always win
Even when I’m right
‘Cause you feed me fables from your head
The violent words and empty threats
And it’s sick that all these battles
Are what keeps me satisfied

[Chorus: Rihanna]
Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
But that’s all right because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
But that’s all right because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
Ohhh, I love the way you lie

[Bridge: Rihanna]
So maybe I’m a masochist
I try to run but I don’t wanna ever leave
'Till the walls are going up
In smoke with all our memories

[Verse 3: Eminem]
It's morning, you wake, a sunray hits your face
Smeared makeup as we lay in the wake of destruction
Hush baby, speak softly, tell me you're awfully sorry
That you pushed me into the coffee table last night so I can push you off me
Try and touch me so I can scream at you not to touch me
Run out the room and I’ll follow you like a lost puppy
Baby, without you, I’m nothing, I’m so lost, hug me
Then tell me how ugly I am, but that you’ll always love me
Then after that, shove me, in the aftermath of the
Destructive path that we’re on, two psychopaths but we
Know that no matter how many knives we put in each other’s backs
That we’ll have each other’s backs, ’cause we’re that lucky
Together, we move mountains, let’s not make mountains out of molehills
You hit me twice, yeah, but who’s counting?
I may have hit you three times, I’m starting to lose count
But together, we’ll live forever, we found the youth fountain
Our love is crazy, we’re nuts, but I refused counseling
This house is too huge, if you move out I’ll burn all two thousand
Square feet of it to the ground, ain’t shit you can do about it
'Cause with you I’m in my fucking mind, without you, I’m out it

[Chorus: Rihanna]
Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
But that’s all right because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
But that’s all right because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie

[Intro]
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah

[Verse 1]
I ain't tryna think about it, no
Yeah, I said it, boy, get up inside it
I want you to homicide it
Go in slow, but I want you to pipe it
And I think I kinda like ya
Up against the wall, we don't need a title

[Chorus]
Yeah, I said it
Yeah, I said it, bae
Yeah, I said it, man, fuck a title

[Verse 2]
Boy, I always like to show
Get a little bit, come a little close, now

Yeah, I said it
Ooh

Give me some love, boy, give it to me 'til the morn'

[Chorus]
Yeah, I said it
Yeah, I said it, babe
Yeah, I said it, uh
Yeah, I said it
Yeah, I said it, babe
Yeah, I said it

[Verse 1]
Nothing but a tear, that's all for breakfast
Watching you pretend you're unaffected
You're pulling our connections, expecting me to let you go
But I won't

[Pre-Chorus]
I know you don't need my protection
But I'm in love, can't blame me for checking
I love in your direction, hoping that the message goes

[Chorus]
Somewhere close to you
Close to you
Like so close if they hurt you, you wouldn't find out
Just say now, I'm coming right now to be close to you

[Verse 2]
Said you let it go, you kept it
Working hard to perfect it
But now your fear is reckless, and it's out of your control
Well just let it go

[Pre-Chorus]
I know you don't need my protection
But I'm in love, can't blame me for checking
I love in your direction, hoping that the message goes

[Chorus]
Somewhere close to you
Close to you
Like so close, if they hurt you, you wouldn't find out
If you let me, I'd be there by now
Close to you

I bet she could never make you cry
‘Cause the scars on your heart are still mine

She can almost be the worst of me
Too bad she's just eating off your dreams
Let me know when you're ready to bleed

[Verse 1]
Found you when your heart was broke
I filled your cup until it overflowed
Took it so far to keep you close (Keep you close)
I was afraid to leave you on your own (Ooh)

[Pre-Chorus]
I said I'd catch you if you fall (Fall)
And if they laugh, then fuck 'em all (All)
And then I got you off your knees
Put you right back on your feet
Just so you could take advantage of me

[Chorus]
Tell me, how's it feel sittin' up there?
Feelin' so high, but too far away to hold me
You know I'm the one who put you up there
Name in the sky, does it ever get lonely?
Thinkin' you could live without me
Thinkin' you could live without me
Baby, I'm the one who put you up there
I don't know why (Yeah, I don't know why)
Thinkin' you could live without me
Live without me
Baby, I'm the one who put you up there
I don't know why (I don't know why, yeah, yeah)

[Verse 2]
Gave love 'bout a hundred tries (Hundred tries)
Just runnin' from the demons in your mind
Then I took yours and made 'em mine (Mine)
I didn't notice 'cause my love was blind

[Pre-Chorus]
Said I'd catch you if you fall (Fall)
And if they laugh, then fuck 'em all (All)
And then I got you off your knees
Put you right back on your feet
Just so you could take advantage of me

[Chorus]
Tell me, how's it feel sittin' up there?
Feelin' so high, but too far away to hold me
You know I'm the one who put you up there
Name in the sky, does it ever get lonely?

I already know (I know)
I had to go and find out from them (Oh-woah)
So tell me, how's it feel? (Oh-woah)

Tell me, how's it feel sittin' up there?
Feelin' so high, but too far away to hold me

[Verse 1]
Your little brother never tells you but he loves you so
You said your mother only smiled on her TV show
You're only happy when your sorry head is filled with dope
I'll hope you make it to the day you're 28 years old

[Pre-Chorus]
You're drippin' like a saturated sunrise
You're spilling like an overflowin' sink
You're ripped at every edge but you're a masterpiece
And now you're tearin' through the pages and the ink

[Chorus]
Everything is blue
His pills, his hands, his jeans
And now I'm covered in the colors
Pull apart at the seams
And it's blue
And it's blue
Everything is gray
His hair, his smoke, his dreams
And now he's so devoid of color
He don't know what it means
And he's blue
And he's blue

[Verse 2]
You were a vision in the morning when the light came through
I know I've only felt religion when I've lied with you
He said, "You'll never be forgiven 'til your boys are too"
And I'm still waking every morning but it's not with you

[Pre-Chorus]
You're drippin' like a saturated sunrise
You're spilling like an overflowin' sink
You're ripped at every edge but you're a masterpiece
And now you're tearin' through the pages and the ink

[Chorus]
Everything is blue
His pills, his hands, his jeans
And now I'm covered in the colors
Pull apart at the seams
And it's blue
And it's blue
Everything is gray
His hair, his smoke, his dreams
And now he's so devoid of color
He don't know what it means
And he's blue
And he's blue

[Bridge]
You were red, and you liked me because I was blue
But you touched me, and suddenly I was a lilac sky
Then you decided purple just wasn't for you

[Chorus]
Everything is blue
His pills, his hands, his jeans
And now I'm covered in the colors
Pull apart at the seams
And it's blue
And it's blue
Everything is gray
His hair, his smoke, his dreams
And now he's so devoid of color
He don't know what it means
And he's blue
And he's blue

[Outro]
Everything is blue
Everything is blue
Everything is blue
Everything is blue

[Verse 1]
Got a boy back home in Michigan
And he tastes like Jack when I'm kissing him
So I told him that I never really liked his friends
Now he's gone and he's calling me a bitch again
There's a guy that lives in the garden state
And he told me that we'd make it 'til we graduate
So I told him that the music would be worth the wait
But he wants me in the kitchen with a dinner plate

[Pre-Chorus]
I believe, I believe, I believe, I believe that we're meant to be
But jealousy, jealousy, jealousy, jealousy get the best of me
Look, I don't mean to frustrate, but I
Always make the same mistakes, yeah
Always make the same mistakes 'cause

[Chorus]
I'm bad at love (Ooh-ooh)
But you can't blame me for tryin'
You know I'd be lyin' sayin'
You were the one (Ooh-ooh)
That could finally fix me
Lookin' at my history
I'm bad at love

[Verse 2]
Got a girl with California eyes
And I thought that she could really be the one this time
But I never got the chance to make her mine
Because she fell in love with little thin white lines
London girl with an attitude
We never told no one, but we look so cute
Both got way better things to do
But I always think about it when I'm riding through

[Pre-Chorus]
I believe, I believe, I believe, I believe that I'm in too deep
And jealousy, jealousy, jealousy, jealousy get the best in me
Look, I don't mean to frustrate, but I
Always make the same mistakes, yeah
Always make the same mistakes 'cause

[Chorus]
I'm bad at love (Ooh-ooh)
But you can't blame me for tryin'
You know I'd be lyin' sayin'
You were the one (Ooh-ooh)
That could finally fix me
Lookin' at my history
I'm bad at love

[Post-Chorus]
Oh, you know, you know, you know, you know
I'm bad at love (Ooh-ooh)
I'm bad at love (Ooh-ooh)

[Bridge]
I know that you're afraid I'm gonna walk away
Each time the feeling fades
Each time the feeling fades
I know that you're afraid I'm gonna walk away
Each time the feeling fades

[Chorus]
You know I'm bad at love (Ooh-ooh)
But you can't blame me for tryin'
You know I'd be lyin' sayin'
You were the one (Ooh-ooh)
That could finally fix me
Lookin' at my history
I'm bad at love (Ooh-ooh)

[Post-Chorus]
Oh, you know, you know, you know, you know
I'm bad at love (Ooh-ooh)
Oh, oh

[Intro]
Now I lay me down to sleep
I pray the Lord, my soul to keep
If I shall die before I wake
I pray the Lord, my soul to take

[Chorus]
I, I keep a record of the wreckage in my life
I gotta recognize the weapon in my mind
They talk shit, but I love it every time
And I realize

[Verse 1]
I've tasted blood and it is sweet
I've had the rug pulled beneath my feet
I've trusted lies and trusted men
Broke down and put myself back together again
Stared in the mirror and punched it to shatters
Collected the pieces and picked out a dagger
I've pinched my skin in between my two fingers
And wished I could cut some parts off with some scissors

[Pre-Chorus]
"Come on, little lady, give us a smile"
No, I ain't got nothin' to smile about
I got no one to smile for, I waited a while for
A moment to say I don't owe you a goddamn thing

[Chorus]
I, I keep a record of the wreckage in my life
I gotta recognize the weapon in my mind
They talk shit, but I love it every time
And I realize

[Post-Chorus]
I'm no sweet dream, but I'm a hell of a night
That I'm no sweet dream, but I'm a hell of a night

[Verse 2]
No, I won't smile, but I'll show you my teeth
And I'ma let you speak if you just let me breathe
I've been polite, but won't be caught dead
Lettin' a man tell me what I should do with my bed
Keep my exes in check in my basement
'Cause kindness is weakness, or worse, you're complacent
I could play nice or I could be a bully
I'm tired and angry, but somebody should be

[Pre-Chorus]
"Come on, little lady, give us a smile"
No, I ain't got nothin' to smile about
I got no one to smile for, I waited a while for
A moment to say I don't owe you a goddamn thing

[Chorus]
I, I keep a record of the wreckage in my life
I gotta recognize the weapon in my mind
They talk shit, but I love it every time
And I realize
I, I keep a record of the wreckage in my life
I gotta recognize the weapon in my mind
They talk shit, but I love it every time
And I realize

[Bridge]
Someone like me can be a real nightmare, completely aware
But I'd rather be a real nightmare, than die unaware, yeah
Someone like me can be a real nightmare, completely aware
But I'm glad to be a real nightmare, so save me your prayers

[Chorus]
I, I keep a record of the wreckage in my life
I gotta recognize the weapon in my mind
They talk shit, but I love it every time
And I realize
I, I keep a record of the wreckage in my life
I gotta recognize the weapon in my mind
They talk shit, but I love it every time
And I realize

[Post-Chorus]
I'm no sweet dream, but I'm a hell of a night
That I'm no sweet dream, but I'm a hell of a night

[Verse 1]
I've missed your calls for months it seems
Don't realize how mean I can be
'Cause I can sometimes treat the people
That I love like jewelry
'Cause I can change my mind each day
I didn't mean to try you on
But I still know your birthday
And your mother's favorite song

[Chorus]
So I'm sorry to my unknown lover
Sorry that I can't believe
That anybody ever really
Starts to fall in love with me
Sorry to my unknown lover
Sorry I could be so blind
Didn't mean to leave you
And all of the things that we had behind
Ooh ooh oooh

[Verse 2]
I run away when things are good
And never really understood
The way you laid your eyes on me
In ways that no one ever could
And so it seems I broke your heart
My ignorance has struck again
I failed to see it from the start
And tore you open 'til the end

[Chorus]
And I'm sorry to my unknown lover
Sorry that I can't believe
That anybody ever really
Starts to fall in love with me
Sorry to my unknown lover
Sorry I could be so blind
Didn't mean to leave you
And all of the things that we had behind

[Bridge]
And someone will love you
Someone will love you
Someone will love you
But someone isn't me
Someone will love you
Someone will love you
Someone will love you
But someone isn't me

[Chorus]
Sorry to my unknown lover
Sorry that I can't believe
That anybody ever really
Starts to fall in love with me
Sorry to my unknown lover
Sorry I could be so blind
Didn't mean to leave you
And all of the things that we had behind

[Outro]
And someone will love you
Someone will love you
Someone will love you
But someone isn't me
And someone will love you
Someone will love you
Someone will love you
But someone isn't me

[Verse 1]
Are you insane like me? Been in pain like me?
Bought a hundred dollar bottle of champagne like me?
Just to pour that motherfucker down the drain like me?
Would you use your water bill to dry the stain like me?
Are you high enough without the Mary Jane like me?
Do you tear yourself apart to entertain like me?
Do the people whisper ‘bout you on the train like me?
Saying that "you shouldn't waste your pretty face" like me?

[Chorus]
And all the people say
"You can't wake up, this is not a dream
You're part of a machine, you are not a human being
With your face all made up, living on a screen
Low on self esteem, so you run on gasoline"

[Post-Chorus]
(Oh, ooh oh, ooh oh, oh)
I think there’s a flaw in my code
(Oh, ooh oh, ooh oh, oh)
These voices won’t leave me alone
Well my heart is gold and my hands are cold

[Verse 2]
Are you deranged like me? Are you strange like me?
Lighting matches just to swallow up the flame like me?
Do you call yourself a fucking hurricane like me?
Pointing fingers cause you'll never take the blame like me?

[Chorus]
And all the people say
"You can't wake up, this is not a dream
You're part of a machine, you are not a human being
With your face all made up, living on a screen
Low on self esteem, so you run on gasoline"

[Post-Chorus]
(Oh, ooh oh, ooh oh, oh)
I think there’s a flaw in my code
(Oh, ooh oh, ooh oh, oh)
These voices won’t leave me alone
Well my heart is gold and my hands are cold

[Intro]
If I
If I

[Verse 1]
Said he tried to phone me, but I never have time
He said that I never listen, but I don't even try
I got a new place in Cali, but I'm gone every night
So I fill it with strangers so they keep on the lights
She said she told you she knows me, but the face isn't right
She asked if I recognized her and I told her I might

[Pre-Chorus]
See, everywhere I go
I got a million different people tryna kick it
But I'm still alone in my mind, yeah

[Chorus]
I know you're dying to meet me
But I can just tell you this
Baby, as soon as you meet me
You'll wish that you never did
(You'll wish that you never did)

[Verse 2]
I stayed a night out in Paris where they don't know my name
And I got into some trouble with that drink in my veins
I got a problem with parties 'cause it's loud in my brain
And I can never say sorry 'cause I won't take the blame
I know I always go missing and you're lying awake
But if you ask why I'm distant, oh, I'm running away

[Pre-Chorus]
You know that everywhere I go
I got a million different people tryna kick it
But I'm still alone in my mind

[Chorus]
I know you're dying to meet me
But I can just tell you this
Baby, as soon as you meet me
You'll wish that you never did
(You'll wish that you never did)

[Bridge]
I, I know you wanna
I, I know you wanna
I, I know you wanna
Slip under my armor
I, I know you wanna
I, I know you wanna
I, I know you wanna
Slip under my armor

[Pre-Chorus]
See, everywhere I go, I got a million different people tryna hit it
But I'm still alone in my mind

[Chorus]
I know you're dying to meet me
But I can just tell you this
Baby, as soon as you meet me
You'll wish that you never did
(You'll wish that you never did)
Yeah

[Outro]
(I know you wanna, I, I know you wanna)
You'll wish that you never did
(I know you wanna slip under my armor)
Oh (I know you wanna, I, I know you wanna)
You'll wish that you never did

[Verse 1]
Cigarettes and tiny liquor bottles
Just what you’d expect inside her new Balenciaga
Viral mess, turned dreams into an empire
Self-made success, now she rolls with Rockefellers

[Pre-Chorus]
Survival of the richest, the city’s ours until the fall
They're Monaco and Hamptons bound
But we don’t feel like outsiders at all

We are the new Americana
High on legal marijuana (Sky high)
Raised on Biggie and Nirvana
We are the new Americana

Young James Dean, some say he looks just like his father
But he could never love somebody’s daughter
Football team loved more than just the game
So he vowed to be his husband at the altar

They're Monaco and Hamptons bound

What kind of bubblegum have you been blowing lately?

Raised on Biggie and Nirvana
We are the new Americana

We are the new Americana
High on legal marijuana (Sky high)
Raised on Biggie and Nirvana
We are the new Americana

I don't wanna fight right now
Know you always right, now

[Verse 2]
I'm turnin' off the light right now
I'm callin' it a night now
Wishin' you were 'round with me
But you're in a different town than me
We've been through it all
But you could never spit it out for me
Tryna talk to a wall
But you could never tear it down for me, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
Never pick up, never call me
You know we're runnin' out of time
Never pick up when you want me
Now I gotta draw a line

[Verse 1: Halsey]
She doesn't kiss me on the mouth anymore
'Cause it's more intimate, than she thinks we should get
She doesn't look me in the eyes anymore
Too scared of what she'll see, somebody holding me

[Pre-Chorus: Halsey]
When I wake up all alone
And I'm thinking of your skin
I remember, I remember what you told me

[Chorus 1: Halsey & Lauren Jauregui]
Said that we're not lovers, we're just strangers
With the same damn hunger
To be touched, to be loved, to feel anything at all
We're not lovers, we're just strangers
With the same damn hunger
To be touched, to be loved, to feel anything at all

[Verse 2: Lauren Jauregui]
She doesn't call me on the phone anymore
She's never listening, she says it's innocent
She doesn't let me have control anymore
I must've crossed a line, I must've lost my mind

[Pre-Chorus: Halsey]
When I wake up all alone
And I'm thinking of your skin
I remember, I remember what you told me

[Chorus 1: Halsey & Lauren Jauregui]
Said that we're not lovers, we're just strangers
With the same damn hunger
To be touched, to be loved, to feel anything at all
We're not lovers, we're just strangers
With the same damn hunger
To be touched, to be loved, to feel anything at all

[Bridge: Halsey, Lauren Jauregui & both]
I miss the mornings with you laying in my bed
I miss the memories replaying in my head
I miss the thought of a forever, you and me
But all you're missing is my body, oh

[Chorus 2: Halsey, Lauren Jauregui & both]
Said we're not lovers (we're not lovers)
'Cause we're just strangers
With the same damn hunger
To be touched, to be loved, to feel anything at all
We're not lovers, we're just strangers
With the same damn hunger
To be touched, to be loved, to feel anything at all (anything)

[Outro: Halsey, Both]
To feel anything at all
To feel anything at all
(You lost it)
(You lost it)
(You lost it)

[Verse 1]
I, I know where to lay
I know what to say
It's all the same
And I, I know how to play
I know this game
It's all the same

[Chorus]
Now if I keep my eyes closed, he looks just like you
But he'll never stay, they never do
Now if I keep my eyes closed, he feels just like you
But you've been replaced
I'm face to face with someone new

[Verse 2]
Would've gave it all for you, cared for you
So tell me where I went wrong
Would've gave it all for you, cared for you
(My lover, my liar)
Would've traded all for you, there for you
So tell me how to move on
Would've traded all for you, cared for you
(My lover, my liar)

[Chorus]
Now if I keep my eyes closed, he looks just like you
But he'll never stay, they never do
Now if I keep my eyes closed, he feels just like you
But you've been replaced
I'm face to face with someone new

[Bridge]
He don't realize that I'm thinkin' about you
It's nothing new, it's nothing new

[Chorus]
Now if I keep my eyes closed, he looks just like you
But he'll never stay, they never do
Now if I keep my eyes closed, he feels just like you
But you've been replaced
I'm face to face with someone new

[Verse 1]
My demons are begging me to open up my mouth
I need them
Mechanically make the words come out
They fight me, vigorous and angry
Watch them pounce
Ignite me
Licking up the flames they bring about

[Pre-Chorus]
I sold my soul to a three-piece
And he told me I was holy
He’s got me down on both knees
But it’s the devil that's tryna...

[Chorus]
Hold me down, hold me down
Sneaking out the back door, make no sound
Knock me out, knock me out
Saying that I want more, this is what I live for
Hold me down, hold me down
Throw me in the deep end, watch me drown
Knock me out, knock me out
Saying that I want more, this is what I live for

[Verse 2]
Selfish
Taking what I want, and call it mine
I’m helpless
Clinging to a little bit of spine
They rush me
Telling me I’m running out of time
They shush me (Shh)
Walking me across a fragile line

[Pre-Chorus]
I sold my soul to a three-piece
And he told me I was holy
He’s got me down on both knees
But it’s the devil that's tryna...

[Chorus]
Hold me down, hold me down
Sneaking out the back door, make no sound
Knock me out, knock me out
Saying that I want more, this is what I live for
Hold me down, hold me down
Throw me in the deep end, watch me drown
Knock me out, knock me out
Saying that I want more, this is what I live for

[Bridge]
Hold me down now
Hold me down now
Hold me do-o-o-o-own

[Pre-Chorus]
I sold my soul to a three-piece
And he told me I was holy
He’s got me down on both knees
But it’s the devil that's tryna...

[Chorus]
Hold me down, hold me down
Sneaking out the back door, make no sound
Knock me out, knock me out
Saying that I want more, this is what I live for
Hold me down, hold me down
Throw me in the deep end, watch me drown
Knock me out, knock me out
Saying that I want more, this is what I live for

[Verse 1]
They sent me away to find them a fortune
A chest filled with diamonds and gold
The house was awake, with shadows and monsters
The hallways, they echoed and groaned

I sat alone, in bed till the morning
I'm crying, "They're coming for me"
And I tried to hold these secrets inside me
My mind's like a deadly disease

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm bigger than my body
I'm colder than this home
I'm meaner than my demons
I'm bigger than these bones

[Chorus]
And all the kids cried out, "Please stop, you're scaring me"
I can't help this awful energy
God damn right, you should be scared of me
Who is in control?

[Verse 2]
I paced around for hours on empty
I jumped at the slightest of sounds
And I couldn't stand the person inside me
I turned all the mirrors around

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm bigger than my body
I'm colder than this home
I'm meaner than my demons
I'm bigger than these bones

[Chorus]
And all the kids cried out, "Please stop, you're scaring me"
I can't help this awful energy
God damn right, you should be scared of me
Who is in control?

[Bridge]
I'm well acquainted with villains that live in my bed
They beg me to write them so they'll never die when I'm dead
And I've grown familiar with villains that live in my head
They beg me to write them so I'll never die when I'm dead

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm bigger than my body
I'm colder than this home
I'm meaner than my demons
I'm bigger than these bones

[Chorus]
And all the kids cried out, "Please stop, you're scaring me"
I can't help this awful energy
God damn right, you should be scared of me
Who is in control?
And all the kids cried out, "Please stop, you're scaring me"
I can't help this awful energy
God damn right, you should be scared of me
Who is in control?

[Verse 1]
Sick of all these people talking, sick of all this noise
Tired of all these cameras flashing, sick of being poised
Now my neck is open wide, begging for a fist around it
Already choking on my pride, so there's no use crying about it

[Pre-Chorus]
Agnus dei
Agnus dei
Agnus dei
Agnus dei

[Chorus]
I'm headed straight for the castle
They wanna make me their queen
And there's a old man sitting on the throne there saying that I probably shouldn't be so mean
I'm headed straight for the castle
They’ve got the Kingdom locked up
And there's the old man sitting on the throne there saying I should probably keep my pretty mouth shut
Straight for the castle

[Verse 2]
Oh, all these minutes passing, sick of feeling used
If you wanna break these walls down, you’re gonna get bruised
Now my neck is open wide, begging for a fist around it
Already choking on my pride, so there's no use crying about it
Crying about it
Crying about it
Crying about it, about it, bout it, bout it

[Chorus]
I'm headed straight for the castle
They wanna make me their queen
And there's an old man sitting on the throne saying that I probably shouldn't be so mean
I'm headed straight for the castle
They’ve got the Kingdom locked up
And there's a old man sitting on the throne there saying I should probably keep my pretty mouth shut
Straight for the castle

[Bridge]
There's no use crying about it
There's no use crying about it
There's no use crying about it
There's no use crying about it

[Chorus]
I'm headed straight for the castle
They wanna make me their queen
And there's the old man sitting on the throne there that's saying that I probably shouldn't be so mean
I'm headed straight for the castle
They’ve got the Kingdom locked up
And there's the old man sitting on the throne there saying I should probably keep my pretty mouth shut
Straight for the castle
They wanna make me their queen
And there's a old man sitting on the throne there saying that I probably shouldn't be so mean
I'm headed straight for the castle
They’ve got the Kingdom locked up
And there's an old man sitting on the throne there saying I should probably keep my pretty mouth shut
Straight for the castle

[Intro]
I'm searching for something that I can't reach

[Verse 1]
I don't like them innocent, I don't want no face fresh
Want them wearing leather, begging, let me be your taste test
I like the sad eyes, bad guys, mouth full of white lies
Kiss me in the corridor, but quick to tell me goodbye

[Pre-Chorus]
You say that you're no good for me
'Cause I'm always tugging at your sleeve
And I swear I hate you when you leave
But I like it anyway

[Chorus]
My ghost, where'd you go?
I can't find you in the body sleeping next to me
My ghost, where'd you go?
What happened to the soul that you used to be?

[Verse 2]
You're a Rolling Stone boy, never-sleep-alone boy
Got a million numbers and they're filling up your phone, boy
I'm off the deep end, sleeping all night through the weekend
Saying that I love him but I know I'm gonna leave him

[Pre-Chorus]
You say that you're no good for me
'Cause I'm always tugging at your sleeve
And I swear I hate you when you leave
But I like it anyway

[Chorus]
My ghost, where'd you go?
I can't find you in the body sleeping next to me
My ghost, where'd you go?
What happened to the soul that you used to be?

[Bridge]
I'm searching for something that I can't reach

[Chorus]
My ghost, where'd you go?
I can't find you in the body sleeping next to me
My ghost, where'd you go?
What happened to the soul that you used to be?

[Verse 1]
There's a place way down in Bed Stuy
Where a boy lives behind bricks
He's got an eye for girls of eighteen
And he turns them out like tricks
I went down to a place in Bed Stuy
A little liquor on my lips
I let him climb inside my body
And held him captive in my kiss

[Pre-Chorus]
And there's a storm you're starting now
And there's a storm you're starting now
And there's a storm you're starting

[Chorus]
I'm a wanderess, I'm a one night stand
Don't belong to no city, don't belong to no man
I'm the violence in the pouring rain
I'm a hurricane
Ha ah ah, ha ah ah, ahh
I'm a hurricane
Ha ah ah, ha ah ah, ahh
I'm a hurricane

[Verse 2]
I went down to a place in Brooklyn
Where ya tripped on LSD
And I found myself reminded
To keep you far away from me

[Pre-Chorus]
And there's a storm you're starting now
And there's a storm you're starting now
And there's a storm you're starting

[Chorus]
I'm a wanderess, I'm a one night stand
Don't belong to no city, don't belong to no man
I'm the violence in the pouring rain
I'm a hurricane
Ha ah ah, ha ah ah, ahh
I'm a hurricane
Ha ah ah, ha ah ah, ahh
I'm a hurricane

[Bridge]
He says, "Oh, baby, beggin' you to save me
Though lately, I like 'em crazy
Oh, maybe, you could devastate me
Little lady, come and fade me"

[Chorus]
I'm a wanderess, I'm a one night stand
Don't belong to no city, don't belong to no man
I'm the violence in the pouring rain
Come and fade me
Come and fade me
I'm a hurricane

[Verse 1]
Sittin' on the counter in your kitchen
Can you hear my heartbeat fucking kickin'?
Your eyes light up 'cause you best believe that I got something up my sleeve
I walk my talk, no time for wishful thinking
I push up on my toes, you call me "sweet thing"
I'm breathing down your neck, your body screaming
And you thought that you were the boss tonight, but I can put up one good fight
I flip the script like I can take a beating

[Chorus]
And when you start to feel the rush
A crimson headache, aching blush
And you surrender to the touch, you'll know
I can put on a show, I can put on a show
Don't you see what you're finding?
This is Heaven in hiding, oh
And when you start to look at me, a physical fatality
And you surrender to the heat, you'll know
I can put on a show, I can put on a show
Don't you see what you're finding?
This is Heaven in hiding
This is Heaven in hiding, oh

[Verse 2]
Sitting on the concrete in your basement
But I don't have no time for conversation
Said this ain't what you usually do, and a girl like me is new for you
And I can tell you mean it 'cause you're shaking

[Chorus]
And when you start to feel the rush
A crimson headache, aching blush
And you surrender to the touch, you'll know
I can put on a show, I can put on a show
Don't you see what you're finding?
This is Heaven in hiding, oh
And when you start to look at me, a physical fatality
And you surrender to the heat, you'll know
I can put on a show, I can put on a show
Don't you see what you're finding?
This is Heaven in hiding
This is Heaven in hiding, oh

[Bridge]
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh (Ooh)
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

[Chorus]
And when you start to feel the rush
A crimson headache, aching blush
And you surrender to the touch, you'll know
I can put on a show, I can put on a show
Don't you see what you're finding?
This is Heaven in hiding, oh
And when you start to look at me, a physical fatality
And you surrender to the heat, you'll know
I can put on a show, I can put on a show
Don't you see what you're finding?
This is Heaven in hiding
This is Heaven in hiding
This is Heaven in hiding, oh

[Outro]
Oh, this is Heaven in hiding
This is Heaven in hiding
'Cause I'm Heaven in hiding

Better than birds of a feather, you and me
We change the weather, yeah
I'm feelin' heat in December when you're 'round me

[Pre-Chorus: Joe Jonas, Joe Jonas & Nick Jonas]

It’s closing time, so leave with me again (Yeah)
You got all my love to spend, oh
Let's find a place where happiness begins

[Pre-Chorus: Joe Jonas]
We gon' dance in my living room, slave to the way you move
Hurts when I’m leaving you (Ayy)
Just dance in the living room, love with an attitude
Drunk to an '80s groove (Ayy)

Hurts when I'm leaving you (Ayy)
Dance in the living room, love with an attitude

Oh, babe, you can't fool me, your body's got other plans
So stop pretending you’re shy, just come on and
Dance, dance, dance, dance, oh

[Verse 2: Nick Jonas]
Early morning la-la-light

’Cause leaving now just don't feel right
Let's do it one more time, oh babe

[Intro: Nick Jonas]
I'm feeling so cool
From top to the bottom, just cool
Every little thing that I do
Well, dammit, I'm feelin' so cool, yeah

[Verse 1: Nick Jonas]
Woke up feelin' like a new James Dean
I comb my hair like an old school scene
I'm feelin' high like a late night summer of last year (Yeah)
Standin' there with the red dress on ya
A Killer Queen like a young Jane Fonda
Is it me or am I just havin' a good year?

[Chorus: Nick Jonas]
Lately, I've been feelin' so cool (Cool)
Top to the bottom, just cool (Cool)
Every little thing that I do (Do)
Dammit, I'm feelin' so coo-oo-oo-oo-oo-ool

Sell 'em for a dollar or two (Two)
Dammit, I'm feeling so coo-oo-oo-oo-oo-ool (Cool)

[Verse 2: Joe Jonas]
Must've done something right 'cause all these
Lights are green, man, they look like palm trees
And every time that song comes on it's about me
Oh, I feel like Post Malone when I get home
Sittin' there, winning like it's Game of Thrones
And now that we've made it, how complicated was last year?

[Chorus: Nick Jonas]
Lately, I've been feelin' so cool (Cool)
Top to the bottom, just cool (Cool)

[Verse 1: Joe Jonas]
Kiss the tears right off your face
Won't get scared, that's the old, old, old me
I'll be there time and place
Lay it on me, all you're hold, hold, holding

[Pre-Chorus: Joe Jonas]
Time, time only heals if we work through it now
And I promise we'll figure this out

[Chorus: Joe Jonas]
I will take your pain
And put it on my heart
I won't hesitate
Just tell me where to start
I thank the oceans for giving me you
You saved me once and now I'll save you too
I won't hesitate for you

[Verse 2: Nick Jonas]
Don't you ever say goodbye
Cross my heart, and you can keep, keep, keep mine
If I could only read your mind
Then I could map out all the ways to make it right

[Pre-Chorus: Nick Jonas]
Time, time only heals if we work through it now
I, I promise we'll figure this out

Pull me close and I'll hold you tight
Don't be scared 'cause I'm on your side

Don't be scared 'cause I'm on your side
Know there's nothing I wouldn't do for you

[Verse 1: Nick Jonas]
Every night, every day, how about every lifetime?
Yeah, I know what they say, and that's fine
'Cause I'm here to stay through the good and the bad times
Baby, save me a space in your mind, yeah

[Pre-Chorus: Nick Jonas]
Well, call me crazy
And people saying that we move too fast
But I've been waiting, and for a reason
Ain’t no turning back

[Chorus: Nick Jonas]
'Cause you show me something I can't live without
I believe, I believe, I believe
When you hold me, it's like Heaven coming down
I believe, I believe, I believe

[Post-Chorus: Nick Jonas]
That you show me (Show me, show me)
That you show me (Show me, show me)

[Verse 2: Joe Jonas]
Everywhere that I go, feeling you all around me
Now that I got you close, I'm alright
Baby, I didn't know, but I'm glad that you found me
'Cause I'm seeing the most in your eyes, oh yeah, yeah

[Pre-Chorus: Joe Jonas & Nick Jonas]
Call me crazy
People saying that we move too fast (Too fast)
But I've been waiting for a reason
Ain’t no turning back

And I believe, I believe, I believe
When you hold me (When you hold me)
It's like Heaven coming down (Mmm, yeah, yeah)
I believe, I believe, I believe

[Post-Chorus: Nick Jonas]

That you show me (Show me, show me), you show me

[Bridge: Nick Jonas & Joe Jonas]
Doesn't matter anymore, now I got you here with me
Nothing matters any longer, now I got you here with me
I think about you every time I, every time I lose myself again
I lose myself again

[Chorus: Nick Jonas]
'Cause you show me something I can't live without
I believe, I believe, I believe
When you hold me, it's like Heaven coming down
I believe, I believe, I believe
'Cause you show me something I can't live without (Oh yeah)
And I believe, I believe, I believe
When you hold me (When you hold me)
It's like Heaven coming down
I believe, I believe, I believe

[Post-Chorus: Nick Jonas]
'Cause you show me (Show me, show me)
(Show me something I can't live without)
That you show me (Show me, show me), no, no
(And I believe, I believe, I believe)
(When you hold me, it's like) Heaven coming down
(Show me, show me)
'Cause you show me (Show me, show me)
I believe, I believe, I believe you

[Outro: Nick Jonas]
Ooh ooh, ooh ooh
Yeah

[Verse 1: Nick Jonas & Joe Jonas]
One day, when I came home at lunchtime
I heard a funny noise
Went out to the backyard to find out if it was
One of those rowdy boys
Stood there with my neighbor called Peter
And a Flux Capacitor

[Pre-Chorus 1: Nick Jonas]
He told me he built a time machine
Like one in a film I've seen, yeah

[Chorus: Nick Jonas & Joe Jonas]
He said, I've been to the year 3000
Not much has changed, but they lived underwater
And your great-great-great-granddaughter
Is doing fine, doing fine

[Verse 2: Nick Jonas & Joe Jonas]
He took me to the future in the flux thing
And I saw everything
Boy bands, and another one, and another one
And another one
Girls there with round hair like Star Wars
Float above the floor

[Pre-Chorus 2: Nick Jonas]
We drove around in a time machine
Like one in a film I've seen, yeah, woo

[Chorus: Nick Jonas & Joe Jonas]
He said, I've been to the year 3000
Not much has changed, but they lived underwater
And your great-great-great-granddaughter
Is doing fine, doing fine

[Bridge: Nick Jonas & Joe Jonas]
I took a ship to the year 3000
This song had gone multi-platinum
Everybody bought our seventh album
It had outsold Kelly Clarkson
I took a ship to the year 3000
This song had gone multi-platinum
Everybody bought our seventh album
(Seventh album, seventh album)

[Pre-Chorus 1: Nick Jonas]
He told me he built a time machine
Like one in a film I've seen, yeah

[Breakdown: Nick Jonas]
I've been to the year 3000
Not much has changed, but they lived underwater
And your great-great-great-granddaughter
Is doing fine, doing fine, oh

[Chorus: Nick & Joe Jonas, and Nick Jonas]
He said, I've been to the year 3000 (Yeah, yeah)
Not much has changed, but they lived underwater (Oh, yeah)
And your great-great-great-granddaughter
Is doing fine, doing fine, doing fine

[Chorus: Nick & Joe Jonas, and Nick Jonas]
He said, I've been to the year 3000
Not much has changed, but they lived underwater (Oh, yeah)
And your great-great-great-granddaughter
Is doing fine, doing fine

[Outro: Nick Jonas]
He said, I've been to the year 3000
Not much has changed, but they lived underwater
And your great-great-great-granddaughter
Is doing fine, doing fine

[Verse 1: Nick Jonas]
Nights, flying down the 10, nearly 2 AM
Happiness begins
Days lifted in a haze, we weren't just a phase
We weren't just pretend (Just pretend)

[Pre-Chorus: Nick Jonas]
I remember low lows and high highs
We threw our hands up, palms out to the skies

[Chorus: Joe Jonas, Joe Jonas & Nick Jonas]
It was fun when we were young and now we're older
Those days when we were broke in California
We were up-and-down and barely made it over
But I'd go back and ride that roller coaster
It was fun when we were young and now we're older
Those days that are the worst, they seem to glow now
We were up-and-down and barely made it over
But I'd go back and ride that roller coaster with you

[Post-Chorus: Joe Jonas & Nick Jonas]
Woo-ooh-ooh, woo-ooh
Woo-ooh-ooh (Oh, oh)
But I'd come back and ride that roller coaster

[Verse 2: Nick Jonas]
Faith led me to the clouds, reaching for the ground
'Cause life was upside down
Now everything has changed, we found better days
But I still hear the sound

[Pre-Chorus: Nick Jonas]
I remember low lows and high highs
We threw our hands up, palms out to the skies

[Chorus: Joe Jonas, Joe Jonas & Nick Jonas]
It was fun when we were young and now we're older
Those days when we were broke in California
We were up-and-down and barely made it over
But I'd go back and ride that roller coaster
It was fun when we were young and now we're older (Oh)
Those days that are the worst, they seem to glow now (Yeah)
We were up-and-down and barely made it over
But I'd go back and ride that roller coaster with you

[Post-Chorus: Joe Jonas & Nick Jonas]
Woo-ooh-ooh (Yeah, with you)
Woo-ooh (With you, with you)
Woo-ooh-ooh (Oh, oh)
But I'd come back and ride that roller coaster

[Chorus: Joe Jonas & Nick Jonas]
It was fun when we were young and now we're older (Oh)
Those days that are the worst, they seem to glow now (Yeah)
We were up-and-down and barely made it over
But I'd go back and ride that roller coaster

[Outro: Nick Jonas]
Nights, flying down the 10, nearly 2 AM
Happiness begins

[Verse 1]
Pardon my interruption
This drink's just settling in
All my reservations
A reason I don't exist
She says, "Can you keep a secret
A ceremony set for June
I know it's a rush but I just love him so much
I hope that you can meet him soon."

[Chorus]
No, I don't wanna love
If it's not you
I don't wanna hear the wedding bells prove
That we can't try
One last time
But I don't wanna hear the wedding bells chime!
Trying to fall asleep
You wake me up cause I'm trying to see the light
Instead of you in white
No I don't wanna hear the wedding bells chime
The wedding bells, wedding bells, wedding bells

[Verse 2]
Pardon my harsh reaction
You put me on the spot
And if I'm being honest
I'm hoping that I'd get caught
Showing you I'm unhappy
Letting you see my truth
Cause if you recall our anniversary falls
11 nights into June

[Chorus]
No, I don't wanna love
If it's not you
I don't wanna hear the wedding bells prove
That we can't try
One last time
But I don't wanna hear the wedding bells chime!
Trying to fall asleep
You wake me up cause I'm trying to see the light
Instead of you in white
No I don't wanna hear the wedding bells chime
The wedding bells

[Bridge:]
Ah ah ah ah ah
The wedding bells
The wedding bells

[Chorus]
No, I don't wanna love
If it's not you
I don't wanna hear the wedding bells prove
That we can't try
One last time
But I don't wanna hear the wedding bells chime!
Trying to fall asleep
You wake me up cause I'm trying to see the light
Instead of you in white
No I don't wanna hear the wedding bells chime
The wedding bells
The wedding bells

[Verse 1: Nick ]
Called you for the first time yesterday
Finally found the missing part of me
I felt so close, but you were far away
Left me without anything to say

[Chorus: Joe with Nick]
Now I'm speechless
Over the edge, I'm just breathless
I never thought that I'd catch this lovebug again
Hopeless, head over heels in the moment
I never thought that I'd get hit by this lovebug again

[Verse 2: Nick & Joe]
I can't get your smile out of my mind
(I can't get you out of my mind)
I think about your eyes all the time
You're beautiful, but you don't even try
(You don't even, don't even try)
Modesty is just so hard to find

[Chorus: Joe & Nick]
Now I'm speechless
Over the edge, I'm just breathless
I never thought that I'd catch this lovebug again
Hopeless, head over heels in the moment
I never thought that I'd get hit by this lovebug again

[Bridge: Joe with Nick]
I kissed her for the first time yesterday
Everything I wished that it would be
Suddenly I forgot how to speak
Hopeless, breathless
Baby, can't you see?

[Breakdown: Joe]
Now I'm!
Yeah, oh!

[Chorus Variation: Joe]
Now I'm speechless
Over the edge, I'm just breathless
I never thought that I'd catch this lovebug again
Now I'm hopeless, head over heels in the moment
I never thought that I'd get hit by this lovebug again

[Outro: Joe with Nick]
Oh, lovebug again

[Verse 1: Joe Jonas]
I'm hot, you're cold
You go around like you know
Who I am, but you don't
You've got me on my toes

[Chorus: Nick Jonas]
I'm slipping into the lava
And I'm trying to keep from going under
Baby, who turned the temperature hotter?
'Cause I'm burnin' up, burnin' up for you, baby
Come on, girl

[Verse 2: Joe Jonas & Nick Jonas]
I fell (I fell) so fast (So fast)
Can't hold myself back
High heels (High heels), red dress (Red dress)
All by yourself, gotta catch my breath

[Chorus: Nick Jonas]
I'm slipping into the lava
And I'm trying to keep from going under
Baby, who turned the temperature hotter?
'Cause I'm burnin' up, burnin' up for you, baby

[Bridge: Nick Jonas]
Walk in the room, all I can see is you, oh
Staring me down, I know you feel it, too

[Breakdown: Nick Jonas]
I'm slipping into the lava
And I'm trying to keep from going under
Baby, who turned the temperature hotter?
'Cause I'm burnin' up, burnin' up for you, baby

[Chorus: Nick Jonas]
Slipping into the lava
And I'm trying to keep from going under
Baby, who turned the temperature hotter?
'Cause I'm burnin' up, burnin' up for you, baby

[Verse 3: Big Rob & (The Jonas Brothers)]
Yo, we're burning up in this place tonight
Your Brothers sing it loud (And we're feeling right)
Get up and dance (Don't try and fight it)
Big Rob's for real (And that's no lie)
Stop, drop and roll (And touch the floor)
(It keeps on burnin' up) more and more
I got JB with me (Laying it down)
Come on boys, let’s bring the chorus around

[Chorus: Nick Jonas & Big Rob]
I'm slipping into the lava
And I'm trying to keep from going under (Yeah)
Baby, who turned the temperature hotter? (Come on, man)
'Cause I'm burnin' up, burnin' up for you, baby

[Outro: Nick Jonas & Big Rob]
Burnin' up (Sup?), burnin' up for you, baby

[Chorus: Nick Jonas]
Spending all your time with your new friends
And you take 'em all the places now that we been
But you used to be the one I love
Yeah, you used to be the one I love
Say you wanna talk, how-have-you-beens
I'm the only one you know that'll listen
And you used to be the one I love
Yeah, you used to be the one I love (Used to be the one I)

[Verse 1: Joe Jonas]
Lately I don't even know ya
Too many devils on your shoulder, shoulder
Oh my God
Baby, if it's what you want
I just wanna see you happy
I can see it in your eyes
And you don't believe me
I don't lie
Even though you're not mine

[Pre-Chorus: Nick Jonas & Joe Jonas]
Cold feet turned into cold weather
We had love, now it don't matter
You just thought you could do better
So do better

[Chorus: Nick Jonas]
Spending all your time with your new friends
And you take 'em all the places now that we been
But you used to be the one I love (Used to be the one I)
Yeah, you used to be the one I love (Used to be the one I)
Say you wanna talk, how-have-you-beens
I'm the only one you know that'll listen
And you used to be the one I love (Used to be the one I)
Yeah, you used to be the one I love (Used to be the one I)

[Verse 2: Joe Jonas & Nick Jonas]
Woke up late and I'm dreamin' (Yeah)
So tired of chasing all your demons (Demons)
Oh my God
Baby, if it's what you want (If it's what you)
Little late if you ask me
But you know I'll come around if you ask me, ask me
I don't lie
Even though you're not mine, oh yeah

[Pre-Chorus: Nick Jonas]
Cold feet turned into cold weather
We had love, now it don't matter
You just thought you could do better
So do better

[Chorus: Nick Jonas]
Spending all your time with your new friends
And you take 'em all the places now that we been
But you used to be the one I love (Used to be the one I)
Yeah, you used to be the one I love (Used to be the one I)
Say you wanna talk, how-have-you-beens
I'm the only one you know that'll listen
And you used to be the one I love (Used to be the one I)
Yeah, you used to be the one I love (Used to be the one I)

[Outro: Joe Jonas & Nick Jonas]
You used to be the one
Yeah, you used to be the one
Yeah, you used to be the one
Used to be the one
Used to be the one I

[Verse 1: Nick Jonas]
Drive me crazy, make me mental
No other buttons she can push
One second she's Miss Sentimental
Then she’s afraid she's said too much

[Pre-Chorus: Nick Jonas]
Opposites attract and we're the livin’ proof of this
But I keep on comin' back like a magnet

[Chorus: Nick Jonas]
'Cause when you love her
No matter the fight you know she's always right
And that's alright
And they say love can hurt
But seein' her smile can get you every time
Yeah, every time
Because you love her, la-la-lala-lala
Love her, yeah

[Verse 2: Joe Jonas]
I put my selfish ways in boxes
And shipped 'em back to where they came
Will never let it get close to bein' toxic
And I promise I’ll never walk away

[Pre-Chorus: Joe Jonas]
Opposites attract and we’re the livin' proof of this
But I keep on comin’ back like a magnet

[Chorus: Joe Jonas]
'Cause when you love her
No matter the fight you know she's always right
And that's alright
And they say love can hurt
But seein’ her smile can get you every time
Yeah, every time
Because you love her, la-la-lala-lala
Love her, yeah

[Bridge: Nick Jonas]
Gotta learn to let the small things go
And know it's always far from perfect
And I know that we can get emotional
But the hardest parts are always worth it

[Chorus: Joe Jonas & Nick Jonas]
'Cause when you love her
No matter the fight you know she's always right
And that's alright
And they say love can hurt
But seein' her smile will get you every time
Yeah, every time
Because you love her, la-la-lala-lala
Love her, yeah

[Outro: Joe Jonas & Nick Jonas]
Because you love her, la-la-lala-lala
Love her, yeah
Because you
Because you love her

[Verse 1: Nick Jonas]
Mr. Misdemeanor
Call me up and say you're needin' my love
Now you say you're leaving, oh yeah
Like you never even needed my love
Then I don't even see you (Ooh ooh, ooh ooh)
Not even for a weekend or a month
So much you left between us (Ooh ooh, ooh ooh)
But you don't ever think about us (Ooh)

[Pre-Chorus: Nick Jonas]
Why do, why do, why do, why do I want you
Even though you make it hard and I don't want to?
And now I'm out here catching feelings like I want you
But all you ever do is look a-, look away

[Chorus: Nick Jonas & Joe Jonas]
Every single time, I keep on coming back to you
You're always on my mind, it doesn't matter what I do, I do
Every single time, I keep on coming back to you
But keep me on the line, if loving you's a crime
Then I won't keep my love locked down for you
Every single time

[Verse 2: Joe Jonas & Nick Jonas]
Yeah, I remember when we met
Like it was yesterday in Amsterdam (Smoke it up)
Making love through every season
Oh, every day, oh, every day
And I can't believe it now (I can't believe it)
You think, you think it's only physical (Oh no, no)
No good at getting even
The way you play, the way you play

[Pre-Chorus: Nick Jonas]
Why do, why do, why do, why do I want you
Even though you make it hard and I don't want to?
And now I'm out here catching feelings like I want you
But all you ever do is look away

[Chorus: Nick Jonas & Joe Jonas]
Every single time, I keep on coming back to you
(I keep on coming)
You're always on my mind (Always on my mind)
It doesn't matter what I do, I do
Every single time, I keep on coming back to you
(I keep coming back to you)
But keep me on the line, if loving you's a crime
Then I won't keep my love locked down for you
Every single time

[Post-Chorus: Nick Jonas]
Every single, every single time
Every single, every single time
Every single, every single time
Love locked down for you

[Bridge: Nick Jonas]
Because there's too much water
Under this bridge to go down like this
I never thought that we'd come this far
To **** it all up and e-end like this

[Chorus: Nick Jonas & Joe Jonas]
Every single time, I keep on coming back to you
You're always on my mind, it doesn't matter what I do (I do)
Every single time, I keep on coming back to you
But keep me on the line, if loving you's a crime
Then I won't keep my love locked down for you
Every single time

[Post-Chorus: Nick Jonas]
Every single, every single time
Every single, every single time
Every single time
Every single, every single time
Every single time

[Verse 1: Nick Jonas]
Come back to me, baby, I'll come back to you
You know the place that I go runnin’ to
I get scared when you're scared but what else can I do?
Come back to me, baby, I'll come back to you

[Chorus: Nick Jonas]
Wherever you are right now
Know somehow
I’ll be on the way like a bat out of hell
Heaven knows I'm proud but I'll turn 'round
Baby, if you stay then I won't let you down, oh
Whatever we've done, whatever we'll do
Baby, if you come back now
I'll come back to you

[Verse 2: Joe Jonas]
Come back to me, baby, I’ll come back to you
Light up the world like only you can do
If you’re lost on the way then I'll get lost too
Come back to me, baby, I’ll come back to you

[Chorus: Joe Jonas]
Wherever you are right now
Know somehow
I'll be on the way like a bat out of hell
Heaven knows I'm proud but I'll turn ’round
Baby, if you stay then I won't let you down, oh
Whatever we've done, whatever we'll do
Baby, if you come back now, I'll come back to you

[Bridge: Joe Jonas & Nick Jonas]
Ooh-ooh
Come back
Ooh-ooh
Come back
Ooh-ooh

[Outro: Nick Jonas]
Come back to me, baby, I'll come back to you
You know the place that I go running to
I get scared when you're scared but what else can I do?
Come back to me, baby, I'll come back to you

[Verse 1: Nick Jonas]
I came here looking for another excuse
To run away from something beautiful
It's like it’s driving me closer to you
Every step back pulls me right back to you

[Pre-Chorus: Nick Jonas]
Time stands still and it's only us
What we feel started way before we ever touched
Just imagine only us
Yeah, you found me right before I'd given up

[Chorus: Joe Jonas]
I just saw the lightning strike
Knew it right then when I looked in your eyes
And I said to myself, "It’s no surprise we ain't strangers"
Strangers tonight
Must be from a different life
Been here before and it just feels right
No, this ain't the first time for you and I, we ain't strangers
Strangers tonight

[Post-Chorus: Joe Jonas & Nick Jonas]
Strangers (strangers)
Strangers (Strangers)
Strangers tonight
Strangers (Strangers)
Strangers (Strangers)
Strangers tonight

[Verse 2: Nick Jonas]
You say my name like it's been on your lips
Familiar in ways I can't explain
You got a heart that I know I can miss
Hold me like that and pull me right back again

[Pre-Chorus: Nick Jonas]
Time stands still and it's only us
What we feel started way before we ever touched
Just imagine only us
Yeah, you found me right before I'd given up

[Chorus: Joe Jonas]
I just saw the lightning strike
Knew it right then when I looked in your eyes
And I said to myself, "It’s no surprise we ain’t strangers"
Strangers tonight
Must be from a different life
Been here before and it just feels right
No, this ain't the first time for you and I, we ain’t strangers
Strangers tonight

[Post-Chorus: Joe Jonas & Nick Jonas]
Strangers  (Strangers)
Strangers (Strangers)
Strangers tonight
Strangers (Strangers)
Strangers (Strangers)
Strangers tonight

[Bridge: Nick Jonas]
I came here looking for another excuse
To run away from something beautiful
It's like it's driving me closer to you
Every step back pulls me right back

[Chorus: Joe Jonas]
I just saw the lightning strike
Knew it right then when I looked in your eyes
And I said to myself, "It's no surprise we ain’t strangers"
Strangers tonight

No, this ain't the first time for you and I, we ain't strangers
Strangers tonight

[Post-Chorus: Joe Jonas & Nick Jonas]
Strangers  (Strangers)
Strangers (Strangers)
Strangers tonight
Strangers (Strangers)
Strangers (Strangers)
Strangers tonight

[Verse 1: Nick Jonas]
Take pictures out of all the frames
Pack up your love with all your things
See if it helps, give it a week
I bet no one else gets you like me

[Pre-Chorus: Nick Jonas]
'Cause I know you think you’re better off without me now
Sayin' all you need is space
But baby, we can work this out

[Chorus: Nick Jonas & Joe Jonas]
But don't throw it away this time, just take a little time to think
Don’t throw it away, it's fine, just don't forget to think of me
Don't throw it away, your mind is messin' with your head again
Instead of walkin' away we should give it a break 'til we know what to say
Don't throw it away

[Verse 2: Nick Jonas]
Don’t save the words ’til it's too late
I know it hurts and that’s okay
If it's too much to open up, then give it time
I see it in your eyes so let's sleep on it tonight

[Pre-Chorus: Nick Jonas]
'Cause I know you think you’re better off without me now
Sayin' all you need is space
But baby, we can work this out

[Chorus: Nick Jonas & Joe Jonas]
But don't throw it away this time, just take a little time to think
Don't throw it away, it's fine, just don't forget to think of me
Don't throw it away, your mind is messin' with your head again
Instead of walkin' away we should give it a break 'til we know what to say
Don't throw it away

[Bridge: Joe Jonas & Nick Jonas]
Take your time-time, take your time, don't throw it away
Take your time-time, don't throw it away, yeah
Take your time-time, take your time, don't throw it away, yeah
Take your time-time, don't throw it away

[Chorus: Nick Jonas & Joe Jonas]
But don't throw it away this time, just take a little time to think
Don't throw it away, it's fine, just don't forget to think of me
Don't throw it away, your mind is messin' with your head again
Instead of walkin' away we should give it a break 'til we know what to say
Don't throw it away this time, just take a little time to think
Don't throw it away, it's fine, just don't forget to think of me
Don't throw it away, your mind is messin' with your head again
Instead of walkin' away we should give it a break 'til we know what to say
Don't throw it away

[Verse 1: Nick Jonas]
Told you I made dinner plans
For you and me and no one else
That don't include your crazy friends
Well, I'm done (I'm done)
With awkward situations, empty conversations

[Chorus: Joe Jonas]
Ooh, this is an S.O.S
Don't wanna second guess
This is the bottom line, it's true
I gave my all for you
Now my heart's in two
And I can't find the other half
It's like I'm walking on broken glass
Better believe I bled
It's a call I'll never get

[Verse 2: Nick Jonas]
So, this is where the story ends
A conversation on I.M
Well, I'm done (I'm done)
With texting sorry for the miscommunication

[Chorus: Joe Jonas]
Ooh, this is an S.O.S
Don't wanna second guess
This is the bottom line, it's true
I gave my all for you
Now my heart's in two
And I can't find the other half
It's like I'm walking on broken glass
Better believe I bled
It's a call I'll never get

[Bridge: Nick Jonas]
Next time I see you
I'm giving you a high five
'Cause hugs are overrated, just FYI

[Breakdown: Joe Jonas]
Ooh, this is an S.O.S
Don't wanna second guess
This is the bottom line, it's true
I gave my all for you
Now my heart's in two, yeah

[Chorus: Joe Jonas]
Ooh, this is an S.O.S
Don't wanna second guess
This is the bottom line, it's true
I gave my all for you
Now my heart's in two
And I can't find the other half
It's like I'm walking on broken glass
Better believe I bled
It's a call I'll never get

[Outro: Nick Jonas]
Call I'll never get
Call I'll never get

[Verse 1: Joe Jonas]
When I look at old stuff, lookin' like it’s over
Lookin' like I'm never going to be that again
Crying over old loves even though they’re over
Never gonna stay friends, yeah, stay friends

[Chorus: Nick Jonas]
They think I'm happy
They think I'm happy when I'm sad
They think I'm happy
They think I'm happy when I'm
They think I'm happy
They think I’m happy when I’m sad
They think I'm happy
They think I’m happy when I'm

[Verse 2: Joe Jonas]
Can't look how we made it, say "Congratulations"
Lookin' like I’ll never be lonely again
See me in the mirror, nothin' ever changes
Never see the sunset, only in my head

[Chorus: Nick Jonas]
They think I'm happy
They think I'm happy when I'm sad
They think I'm happy
They think I'm happy when I'm
They think I'm happy
They think I'm happy when I'm sad
They think I'm happy
They think I'm happy when I'm

[Post-Chorus: Joe Jonas & Nick Jonas]
Never gonna stop, never gonna calm down
Never gonna stop
They think I'm happy when I'm
Never gonna stop, never gonna calm down
Never gonna stop, no
They think I'm happy when I'm

[Bridge: Nick Jonas]
I put on a smile, don't need a face-lift
Why can't I when everybody fakes it?
Well, they think I'm happy
Like they know exactly how I feel
It ain't real, but they still think

[Chorus: Nick Jonas]
They think I'm happy
They think I'm happy when I'm sad
They think I'm happy
They think I'm happy when I'm
They think I'm happy
They think I'm happy when I'm sad
They think I'm happy
They think I'm happy when I'm

[Post-Chorus: Joe Jonas & Nick Jonas]
Never gonna stop (I try), never gonna calm down
Never gonna stop
They think I'm happy when I'm
Never gonna stop, never gonna calm down
Never gonna stop, no
They think I'm happy when I'm

[Intro: Joe Jonas]
I don't trust myself when I'm around you
I don't trust myself when I'm around you

[Verse 1: Joe Jonas]
Lately, I don't think I even know me
Every time you come around, I'm like the old me, old me
Take me back to when you were my only
Well, we were thicker than thieves, like a pod, two peas

[Pre-Chorus: Nick Jonas]
And all at once, it's like I'm being someone else, yeah
You're all I want, but I know that you're bad for my health

[Chorus: Joe Jonas]
I don't trust myself when I'm around you
I don't trust myself when I'm around you
Doing things I never do, acting like a damn fool
I don't trust myself when I'm around you

[Verse 2: Nick Jonas]
I know that I'm better off without you
But I know that I could never live without you, 'out you
Thinkin' 'bout my lips upon your mouth, yeah
Got me weak in the knees, my God, can't breathe

[Pre-Chorus: Nick Jonas]
And all at once (All at once)
It's like I'm being someone else (I can be your someone else)
All I want (All I want)
I know that you're bad for my health (Oh no, no)

[Chorus: Joe Jonas & Nick Jonas]
I don't trust myself when I'm around you (Hey)
I don't trust myself when I'm around you (Without you, baby)
Doing things I never do (Ayy, ayy, ayy)
Acting like a damn fool
Yeah, I don't trust myself when I'm around you
(When I'm around you, baby)

[Bridge: Joe Jonas]
I don't trust, I don't trust myself
I don't trust myself, yeah
I don't trust, I don't trust myself
I don't trust myself
I don't trust myself when I'm around you

[Chorus: Joe Jonas & Nick Jonas]
I don't trust myself when I'm around you (Hey)
I don't trust myself when I'm around you (Around you, baby)
Doing things I never do (Ayy, ayy, ayy)
Acting like a damn fool
Yeah, I don't trust myself when I'm around you

[Intro]
La-da-da-da-da, la-da-da-da-da
Da-da-da

[Verse 1]
We are searchlights, we can see in the dark
We are rockets, pointed up at the stars
We are billions of beautiful hearts
And you sold us down the river too far

[Chorus]
What about us?
What about all the times you said you had the answers?
What about us?
What about all the broken happy ever afters?
What about us?
What about all the plans that ended in disaster?
What about love? What about trust?
What about us?

[Verse 2]
We are problems that want to be solved
We are children that need to be loved
We were willin', we came when you called
But man, you fooled us, enough is enough, oh

[Chorus]
What about us?
What about all the times you said you had the answers?
What about us?
What about all the broken happy ever afters?
Oh, what about us?
What about all the plans that ended in disaster?
Oh, what about love? What about trust?
What about us?
Oh, what about us?
What about all the plans that ended in disaster?
What about love? What about trust?
What about us?

[Bridge]
Sticks and stones, they may break these bones
But then I'll be ready, are you ready?
It's the start of us, waking up come on
Are you ready? I'll be ready
I don't want control, I want to let go
Are you ready? I'll be ready
'Cause now it's time to let them know
We are ready, what about us?

[Chorus]
What about us?
What about all the times you said you had the answers?
So what about us?
What about all the broken happy ever afters?
Oh, what about us?
What about all the plans that ended in disaster?
Oh, what about love? What about trust?
What about us?

[Outro]
What about us?
What about us?
What about us?
What about us?
What about us?
What about us?

[Verse 1: P!nk]
Right from the start
You were a thief you stole my heart
And I your willing victim
I let you see the parts of me
That weren't all that pretty
And with every touch you fixed them
Now you've been talking in your sleep
Oh, oh
Things you never say to me
Oh, oh
Tell me that you've had enough
Of our love, our love

[Chorus: P!nk]
Just give me a reason
Just a little bit's enough
Just a second - we're not broken, just bent
And we can learn to love again
It's in the stars
It's been written in the scars on our hearts
We're not broken, just bent
And we can learn to love again

[Verse 2: Nate Ruess & P!nk & both]
I'm sorry I don't understand where all of this is coming from
I thought that we were fine
(Oh we had everything)
Your head is running wild again
My dear we still have everything
And it's all in your mind
(Yeah but this is happening)
Now you've been having real bad dreams
Oh, oh
You used to lie so close to me
Oh, oh
There's nothing more than empty sheets
Between our love, our love
Oh, our love, our love, love

[Chorus: Nate Ruess & both]
Just give me a reason
Just a little bit’s enough
Just a second - we’re not broken, just bent
And we can learn to love again
I’ve never stopped
You’re still written in the scars on my heart
You’re not broken, just bent
And we can learn to love again

[Bridge: Nate Ruess & P!nk]
Oh, tears ducts and rust
I'll fix it for us
We're collecting dust but our love's enough
You're holding it in
You're pouring a drink
No nothing is as bad as it seems
We'll come clean

[Chorus: Both]
Just give me a reason
Just a little bit's enough
Just a second we're not broken just bent
And we can learn to love again
It's in the stars
It's been written in the scars on our hearts
That we're not broken just bent
And we can learn to love again

[Chorus: Both]
Just give me a reason
Just a little bit's enough
Just a second we're not broken just bent
And we can learn to love again
It's in the stars
It's still written in the scars on our hearts
That we're not broken just bent
And we can learn to love again

[Outro: P!nk]
Oh, we can learn to love again
Oh, we can learn to love again
Oh
That we're not broken just bent
And we can learn to love again

[Verse 1]
We were on fire
I slashed your tires
It's like we burn so bright, we burn out
I made you chase me
I wasn't that friendly
My love, my drug, we're fucked up, oh

[Pre-Chorus 1]
'Cause I've been on the run so long they can't find me
You're waking up to remember I'm pretty
And when the chemicals leave my body
Yeah, they're gonna find me in a hotel lobby 'cause
Mmm, tough
Times they keep comin'
All night
Laughin' and fuckin'
Some days like I'm barely breathin'
After we were high and the love dope died it was you

[Chorus]
The pill I keep takin'
The nightmare I wake in
There's nothin', no nothin', nothin' but you
My perfect rock bottom
My beautiful trauma
My love, my love, my drug, oh

[Post-Chorus]
My love, my love, my love, my drug, oh
My love, my love, my love, my drug, oh
My love, my love, my love, my drug, oh
My love, (oh) my love, my drug, we're fucked up

[Verse 2]
You punched a hole in
The wall and I framed it
I wish I could feel things like you
Everyone's chasing
That holy feeling
And if we don't stay lit we'll blow out
Blow out

[Pre-Chorus 2]
'Cause we've been on the run so long they can't find us
Who's gonna have to die to remind us
That it feels like we chose this blindly
Now I'm gonna fuck up a hotel lobby
'Cause these tough
Times they keep comin'
Last night
I might have messed it up again
Some days like I'm barely breathin'
But after we were high and the love dope died it was you

[Chorus]
The pill I keep takin'
The nightmare I wake in
There's nothin', no nothin', nothin' but you
My perfect rock bottom
My beautiful trauma
My love, my love, my drug, oh

[Post-Chorus]
My love, my love, my love, my drug, oh
My love, my love, my love, my drug, oh
My love, my love, my love, my drug, oh
(My drug) my love, my love, my drug, we're fucked up

[Bridge]
Mmm tough
Times they keep comin'
All night
Laughin' and fuckin'
Some days like I'm barely breathin'
After we were high and the love dope died it was you

[Chorus]
The pill I keep takin'
The nightmare I wake in
There's nothin', no nothin', nothin' but you
My perfect rock bottom
My beautiful trauma
My love, my love, my drug, oh (drug)

[Intro: P!nk]
Mhm, mhm, mhm, mhm, mhm, mhm, mhm

[Verse 1: P!nk]
Like Leo in The Revenant
Abel in that Bible bit
Revenge is sweet, isn't it?
Really, really hope for it
I know that it won't fix a thing
A song like this that I could sing for you
(Mhm mhm mhm mhm mhm mhm mhm)
All the feels you make me do
A nightmare fuckin' comin' true
I wish I was a lawyer, I would sue you
Sue you, take your dog, take your house
Take your shoes, take your heart
(Mhm mhm mhm mhm mhm mhm mhm)
And now here comes that singin' part

[Pre-Hook: P!nk]
I'm daydreamin', let me count the ways
How I'll get you or how I'll make you pay
(Mhm mhm mhm mhm mhm mhm mhm)
Babe, I'm hurtin' and now you'll feel the same
That's my plan, that's my plan, that's my plan, mhm
(Mhm mhm mhm mhm mhm mhm mhm)

[Hook: P!nk]
We could do revenge, revenge, revenge
Revenge together, together, together
We could take revenge, revenge, revenge
Revenge is sweet
(Mhm mhm mhm mhm mhm mhm mhm)
We could do revenge, revenge, revenge
Revenge together, together, together
We could take revenge, revenge, revenge
Revenge is sweet (now, now)

[Verse 2: P!nk]
Now here's where girlfriends come in hand
Especially those that understand
Crime's a crime, but listen, man
Really cannot give a damn
We've all been through this kind of thing
Say the word, we make it sting for him
(Mhm mhm mhm mhm mhm mhm mhm)
He can't just get away with it
Eye for eye, you piece of sh—
You treat us like a garbage pit
Let me at him, wait for it, wait for it, wait for it
Here's that singin' part again
(Mhm mhm mhm mhm mhm mhm mhm)

[Pre-Hook: P!nk]
I'm daydreamin' (I'm daydreamin')
Let me count the ways (let me count the ways)
How I'll get you (how I'll get you)
Or how I'll make you pay (you pay)
(Mhm mhm mhm mhm mhm mhm mhm)
Babe, I'm hurtin' (I'm hurtin')
And now you'll feel the same (feel the same)
That's my plan, that's my plan, that's my plan
(Mhm mhm mhm mhm mhm mhm mhm)

[Hook: P!nk]
We could do revenge, revenge, revenge
Revenge together, together, together
We could take revenge, revenge, revenge
Revenge is sweet
(Mhm mhm mhm mhm mhm mhm mhm)
We could do revenge, revenge, revenge
Revenge together, together, together
We could take revenge, revenge, revenge
Revenge is sweet (revenge is sweet)

[Verse 3: Eminem]
Well, in the beginning we
Felt like we was meant to be
I fell for you and skinned my knee
But hell, with any injury, eventually you'll get up gingerly
Feels like it'll take a century to heal
But just know that I will
(Mhm, mhm, mhm, mhm, mhm, mhm, mhm)
But fuck tryna make amends, I'd rather take revenge
You're stickin' safety pins inside my atrium
Your day begins at 8 p.m.
You hit the ATM in my Mercedes Benz
With all your lady friends—whores!
Hit the club and you go out
Don't know a sum, 'cause when I calculate
The times you cheated and I total up all the amounts
It doesn't add up, 'cause you say that just givin' out your number doesn't count, get it? (I hate you)
And then see me with someone new, get mad and flip it, look how bad you spin it
First you turn your back on me, then tell me that I stabbed you in it?!
(Stabbed you in it, stabbed you in it
Stabbed you in it, stabbed you in it, SLUT!)
So when you're driving, driving to his house
And you pass me, while I'm drivin' to hers
Just remember, you cheated on me first (bitch!)
You're a whore, you're a whore, this is war
Fellas, ladies

[Hook: Eminem & P!nk]
We could do revenge, revenge, revenge
Revenge together, together, together (oh-ohh)
We could take revenge, revenge, revenge
Revenge is sweet (so sweet, oh-ohh)
(Mhm mhm mhm mhm mhm mhm mhm)
We could do revenge revenge, revenge
Revenge together, together, together
We could take revenge, revenge, revenge
Revenge is sweet

[Outro: Eminem & P!nk]
Fuck yeah!
Fuck no!

[Verse 1]
I know that I am runnin' out of time
I want it all, mmm, mmm
And I'm wishin' they'd stop tryin' to turn me off
I want it on, mmm, mmm
And I'm walkin' on a wire, tryin' to go higher
Feels like I'm surrounded by clowns and liars
Even when I give it all away
I want it all, mmm, mmm

[Pre-Chorus]
We came here to run it, run it, run it
We came here to run it, run it, run it

[Chorus]
Just like fire, burnin' up the way
If I could light the world up for just one day
Watch this madness, colorful charade
No one can be just like me any way
Just like magic,  I'll be flyin' free
I'mma disappear when they come for me
I kick that ceiling, what you gonna say?
No one can be just like me anyway
Just like fire, uh

[Verse 2]
And people like to laugh at you cause they are all the same, mmm, mmm
See I would rather we just go a different way than play the game
And no matter the weather, we can do it better
You and me together, forever and ever
We don't have to worry 'bout a thing, 'bout a thing

[Pre-Chorus]
We came here to run it, run it, run it
We came here to run it, run it, run it

[Chorus]
Just like fire, burnin' up the way
If I could light the world up for just one day
Watch this madness, colorful charade
No one can be just like me any way
Just like magic,  I'll be flyin' free
I'mma disappear when they come for me
I kick that ceiling, what you gonna say?
No one can be just like me anyway
Just like fire, fire, fire
Run it, run it, run it
We came here to run it, run it, run it

[Verse 3]
So look, I came here to run it
Just cause nobody's done it
Y'all don't think I can run it
But look, I been here, I done it
Impossible? Please
Watch, I do it with ease
You just gotta believe
Come uh, come uh with me
Oh, what's a girl to do?
(What, what?)
Hey, what's a girl to do?
(What, what?)
Oh, what's a girl to do?
(What, what?)
Mmmm, what's a girl to do?

[Bridge: Acoustic]
Just like fire, burnin' up the way
If I could light the world up for just one day
Watch this madness, colorful charade
No one can be just like me any way

[Chorus]
Just like fire, burnin' up the way
If I could light the world up for just one day
Watch this madness, colorful charade
No one can be just like me any way
Just like magic,  I'll be flyin' free
I'mma disappear when they come for me
I kick that ceiling, what you gonna say?
No one can be just like me anyway
Just like fire, fire

[Outro]
Run it, run it, run it
Just like fire
Run it, run it, run it

[Intro]
Na na na na na na na, na na na na na na
Na na na na na na na, na na na na na na

[Verse 1]
I guess I just lost my husband, I don't know where he went
So I'm gonna drink my money, I'm not gonna pay his rent (Nope!)
I got a brand new attitude and I'm gonna wear it tonight
I wanna get in trouble, I wanna start a fight
Na na na na na na na, I wanna start a fight
Na na na na na na na, I wanna start a fight

[Chorus]
So, so what? I'm still a rockstar
I got my rock moves and I don't need you
And guess what? I'm havin' more fun
And now that we're done
I'm gonna show you tonight
I'm alright
I'm just fine and you're a tool
So, so what? I am a rockstar
I got my rock moves and I don't want you tonight

[Verse 2]
(Uh, check my flow, uh)
The waiter just took my table
And gave it to Jessica Simps (Shit!)
I guess I'll go sit with drum boy
At least he'll know how to hit (Oops!)
What if this song's on the radio?
Then somebody's gonna die
I'm gonna get in trouble
My ex will start a fight
Na na na na na na na, he's gonna start a fight (Huh!)
Na na na na na na na, we're all gonna get in a fight!

[Chorus]
So, so what? I'm still a rockstar
I got my rock moves and I don't need you
And guess what? I'm havin' more fun
And now that we're done
I'm gonna show you tonight
I'm alright (I'm alright)
I'm just fine and you're a tool
So, so what? I am a rockstar
I got my rock moves and I don't want you tonight

[Bridge]
You weren't there, you never were
You want it all, but that's not fair
I gave you life, I gave my all
You weren't there, you let me fall

[Chorus]
So, so what? I'm still a rockstar
I got my rock moves and I don't need you
And guess what? I'm havin' more fun
And now that we're done (We're done)
I'm gonna show you tonight
I'm alright (I'm alright)
I'm just fine (I'm just fine) and you're a tool
So, so what? I am a rockstar (Oh)
I got my rock moves and I don't want you tonight
(I don't want you tonight)

[Outro]
No, no, no, no
I don't want you tonight
You weren't there
I'm gonna show you tonight (I'm gonna show you tonight)
I'm alright (I'm alright)
I'm just fine and you're a tool
So, so what? I am a rockstar
I got my rock moves and I don't want you tonight
(I don't want you tonight!)

[Outro]
Woohoo!
Ba da da da da da

[Verse 1]
There's somethin' in the way you roll your eyes
Takes me back to a better time
When I saw everything is good
But now you're the only thing that's good
Tryna stand up on my own two feet
This conversation ain't coming easily
And darlin', I know it's getting late
So what do you say we leave this place?

[Chorus]
Walk me home in the dead of night
I can't be alone with all that's on my mind, mhm
So say you'll stay with me tonight
'Cause there is so much wrong goin' on outside

[Verse 2]
There's somethin' in the way I wanna cry
That makes me think we'll make it out alive
So come on and show me how we're good
I think that we could do some good, mhm

[Chorus]
Walk me home in the dead of night
I can't be alone with all that's on my mind, mhm
So say you'll stay with me tonight
'Cause there is so much wrong goin' on outside

[Bridge]
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh

[Chorus]
Walk me home in the dead of night
'Cause I can't be alone with all that's on my mind
Say you'll stay with me tonight
'Cause there is so much wrong goin' on
Walk me home in the dead of night
I can't be alone with all that's on my mind
So say you'll stay with me tonight
'Cause there is so much wrong, there is so much wrong
There is so much wrong goin' on outside

[Verse 1]
You took my hand, you showed me how
You promised me you'd be around
Uh-huh, that's right
I took your words and I believed
In everything you said to me
Yeah-huh, that's right

[Chorus]
If someone said three years from now
You'd be long gone
I'd stand up and punch them out
'Cause they're all wrong
I know better, 'cause you said forever
And ever, who knew?

[Verse 2]
Remember when we were such fools
And so convinced and just too cool
Oh no, no no
I wish I could touch you again
I wish I could still call you friend
I'd give anything

[Chorus]
When someone said count your blessings now
'Fore they're long gone
I guess I just didn't know how
I was all wrong
They knew better, still you said forever
And ever, who knew?

[Bridge]
Yeah, yeah
I'll keep you locked in my head
Until we meet again
Until we, until we meet again
And I won't forget you my friend
What happened?

[Chorus]
If someone said three years from now
You'd be long gone
I'd stand up and punch them out
'Cause they're all wrong and

[Outro]
That last kiss, I'll cherish, until we meet again
And time makes it harder, I wish I could remember
But I keep your memory, you visit me in my sleep
My darling, who knew?
My darling, my darling, who knew?
My darling, I miss you
My darling, who knew?
Who knew?

[Verse 1]
Made a wrong turn, once or twice
Dug my way out, blood and fire
Bad decisions, that's alright
Welcome to my silly life
Mistreated, misplaced, misunderstood
Miss “Knowing it's all good”
It didn't slow me down
Mistaken, always second guessing
Underestimated
Look, I'm still around

[Chorus]
Pretty, pretty please
Don't you ever, ever feel
Like you're less than fuckin' perfect
Pretty, pretty please
If you ever, ever feel
Like you're nothing, you're fuckin' perfect to me

[Verse 2]
You're so mean
When you talk
About yourself, you were wrong
Change the voices in your head
Make them like you instead
So complicated, look happy, you'll make it
Filled with so much hatred, such a tired game
It's enough, I've done all I can think of
Chased down all my demons, I've seen you do the same, oh

[Chorus]
Pretty, pretty please
Don't you ever, ever feel
Like you're less than fuckin' perfect
Pretty, pretty please
If you ever, ever feel
Like you're nothing, you're fuckin' perfect to me

[Bridge]
The whole world's scared, so I swallow the fear
The only thing I should be drinking is an ice-cold beer
So cool in line, and we try, try, try
But we try too hard, it's a waste of my time
Done looking for the critics, 'cause they're everywhere
They don't like my jeans, they don't get my hair
Exchange ourselves and we do it all the time
Why do we do that?
Why do I do that?
(Why do I do that?)

[Chorus]
Yeah, oh, oh pretty, pretty please
Pretty, pretty please
Don't you ever, ever feel
Like you're less than fuckin' perfect
Pretty, pretty please
If you ever, ever feel
Like you're nothing, you're fuckin' perfect to me
Yeah, you're perfect, you're perfect, oh
Pretty, pretty please
If you ever, ever feel
Like you're nothing, you're fuckin' perfect to me

[Verse 1]
White knuckles
And sweaty palms from hanging on too tight
Clenched shut jaw
I've got another headache again tonight
Eyes on fire, eyes on fire
And they burn from all the tears
I've been crying, I've been crying
I've been dying over you
Tie a knot in the rope
Tryna hold, tryna to hold
But there's nothing to grasp so
I let go

[Chorus]
I think I finally had enough
I think I maybe think too much
I think this might be it for us
Blow me one last kiss
You think I'm just too serious
I think you're full of shit
My head is spinning so
Blow me one last kiss
Just when it can't get worse
I've had a shit day
Have you had a shit day?
We've had a shit day
I think that life's too short for this
I want back my ignorance and bliss
I think I've had enough of this
Blow me one last kiss

[Verse 2]
I won't miss
All of the fighting that we always did
Take it in
I mean what I say when I say there is nothing left
No more sick
Whiskey dick
No more battles for me
You'll be calling a trick
Cause you no longer sleep
I'll dress nice
I'll look good
I'll go dancing alone
I will laugh
I'll get drunk
I'll take somebody home

[Chorus]
I think I finally had enough
I think I maybe think too much
I think this might be it for us
Blow me one last kiss
You think I'm just too serious
I think you're full of shit
My head is spinning so
Blow me one last kiss
Just when it can't get worse
I've had a shit day
Have you had a shit day?
We've had a shit day
I think that life's too short for this
I want back my ignorance and bliss
I think I've had enough of this
Blow me one last kiss

[Interlude]
Blow me one last kiss
Blow me one last kiss

[Bridge]
I will do what I please
Anything that I want
I will breathe
I will breathe
I won't worry at all
You will pay for your sins
You'll be sorry, my dear
All the lies, all the "why's" will be crystal clear

[Chorus]
I think I finally had enough
I think I maybe think too much
I think this might be it for us
Blow me one last kiss
You think I'm just too serious
I think you're full of shit
My head is spinning so
Blow me one last kiss
Just when it can't get worse
I've had a shit day
Have you had a shit day?
We've had a shit day
I think that life's too short for this
I want back my ignorance and bliss
I think I've had enough of this
Blow me one last kiss

[Interlude]
Blow me one last kiss
Blow me one last kiss

[Chorus]
Just when it can't get worse
I've had a shit day
Have you had a shit day?
We've had a shit day
I think that life's too short for this
I want back my ignorance and bliss
I think I've had enough of this
Blow me one last kiss

[Verse 1: P!nk]
Sometimes I hate every single stupid word you say
Sometimes I wanna slap you in your whole face
There's no one quite like you
You push all my buttons down
I know life would suck without you

[Pre-Chorus: P!nk]
At the same time, I wanna hug you
I wanna wrap my hands around your neck
You're an asshole but I love you
And you make me so mad I ask myself
Why I'm still here, or where could I go
You're the only love I've ever known
But I hate you, I really hate you
So much, I think it must be

[Chorus: P!nk]
True love, true love
It must be true love
Nothing else can break my heart like
True love, true love
It must be true love
No one else can break my heart like you

[Verse 2: P!nk]
Just once try to wrap your little brain around my feelings
Just once please try not to be so mean
Repeat after me now R-O-M-A-N-C-E-E-E
Come on, I'll say it slowly (romance)
You can do it babe!

[Pre-Chorus: P!nk]
At the same time, I wanna hug you
I wanna wrap my hands around your neck
You're an asshole but I love you
And you make me so mad I ask myself
Why I'm still here, or where could I go
You're the only love I've ever known
But I hate you, I really hate you
So much, I think it must be

[Chorus: P!nk]
True love, true love
It must be true love
Nothing else can break my heart like
True love, true love
It must be true love
No one else can break my heart like you

[Interlude: P!nk]
I think it must be love (I love you)
I think it must be love (I love you)

[Bridge: Lily Allen]
Why do you rub me up the wrong way?
Why do you say the things that you say?
Sometimes I wonder how we ever came to be
But without you I'm incomplete

[Chorus: P!nk]
I think it must be
True love, true love
It must be true love
Nothing else can break my heart like
True love, true love
It must be true love
No one else can break my heart like you (like you)
No one else can break my heart like you (like you)
No one else can break my heart like you

[Verse 1: P!nk]
Boy, you make it sound so pretty even when it's not
Didn't choose, but it's the only one we've got
And sometimes, I get so tired of getting tied up in my thoughts
You're the only one that ever makes it stop

[Chorus: P!nk]
God, it hurts to be human
Without you, I'd be losing
And someday, we'll face the music
God, it hurts to be human

[Post-Chorus: P!nk]
But I've got you, you, you, you, you, hey
And you've got me, me, me, me, too

[Verse 2: Khalid]
Like we're buckled and preparing for the crash
Like we're walking down a road of broken glass
Now if we defeat all odds and it was us against the world
You can count on me, you know I'd have your back

[Chorus: P!nk & Khalid]
God, it hurts to be human
Without you, I'd be losing
And someday, we'll face the music
God, it hurts to be human

[Post-Chorus: P!nk & Khalid]
But I've got you, you, you, you, you, hey
And you've got me, me, me, me, too
But I've got you, you, you, you, you, hey
And you've got me, me, me, me, too

[Bridge: P!nk, Khalid & Both]
Hope floats away
If you could spend a day in my shoes
Your mind would change
If you knew what I've gone through
We want the same (Yeah, we do)
Maybe then you'd understand
How it hurts to be human, oh

[Chorus: P!nk & Khalid, Khalid]
God, it hurts to be human
Without you (Without you)
I'd be losing (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
And someday, we'll face the music (Yeah)
God, it hurts (Yeah) to be human

[Post-Chorus: P!nk & Khalid]
But I've got you, you, you, you, you, hey
And you've got me, me, me, me, too
But I've got you, you, you, you, you, hey
And you've got me, me, me, me, too

[Outro: P!nk & Khalid]
Oh God, it hurts to be human

[Verse 1]
I close my eyes and I can see
A world that's waiting up for me that I call my own
Through the dark, through the door
Through where no one’s been before
But it feels like home

[Pre-Chorus]
They can say, they can say it all sounds crazy
They can say, they can say I've lost my mind
I don't care, I don’t care, if they call me crazy
We can live in a world that we design

[Chorus]
'Cause every night, I lie in bed
The brightest colors fill my head
A million dreams are keeping me awake
I think of what the world could be
A vision of the one I see
A million dreams is all it's gonna take
Oh, a million dreams for the world we're gonna make

[Verse 2]
There's a house we can build
Every room inside is filled with things from far away
Special things I compile
Each one there to make you smile on a rainy day

[Pre-Chorus]
They can say, they can say it all sounds crazy
They can say, they can say we've lost our minds
See, I don't care, I don't care if they call us crazy
Run away to a world that we design

[Chorus]
'Cause every night, I lie in bed
The brightest colors fill my head
A million dreams are keeping me awake
I think of what the world could be
A vision of the one I see
A million dreams is all it’s gonna take
Oh, a million dreams for the world we’re gonna make

[Bridge]
However big, however small
Let me be part of it all
Share your dreams with me
We may be right, we may be wrong
But I wanna bring you along to the world I see
To the world we close our eyes to see
We close our eyes to see

[Chorus]
Every night, I lie in bed
The brightest colors fill my head
A million dreams are keeping me awake
I think of what the world could be
A vision of the one I see
A million dreams is all it's gonna take
A million dreams for the world we're gonna make

[Outro]
For the world we're gonna make

[Verse 1]
Dear Mr. President, come take a walk with me
(Come take a walk with me)
Let's pretend we're just two people and you're not better than me
I'd like to ask you some questions if we can speak honestly
What do you feel when you see all the homeless on the street?
Who do you pray for at night before you go to sleep?
What do you feel when you look in the mirror?
Are you proud?

[Chorus]
How do you sleep while the rest of us cry?
How do you dream when a mother has no chance to say goodbye?
How do you walk with your head held high?
Can you even look me in the eye
And tell me why?

[Verse 2]
Dear Mr. President, were you a lonely boy? (Were you a lonely boy?)
Are you a lonely boy? (Are you a lonely boy?)
How can you say, "No child is left behind"?
We're not dumb and we're not blind (We're not blind)
They're all sitting in your cells
While you pave the road to hell
What kind of father would take his own daughter's rights away?
And what kind of father might hate his own daughter if she were gay?
I can only imagine what the first lady has to say
You've come a long way from whiskey and cocaine

[Chorus]
How do you sleep while the rest of us cry?
How do you dream when a mother has no chance to say goodbye?
How do you walk with your head held high?
Can you even look me in the eye?

[Bridge]
Let me tell you 'bout hard work
Minimum wage with a baby on the way
Let me tell you 'bout hard work
Rebuilding your house after the bombs took them away
Let me tell you 'bout hard work
Building a bed out of a cardboard box
Let me tell you 'bout hard work
Hard work
Hard work
You don't know nothing 'bout hard work
Hard work
Hard work

[Outro]
How do you sleep at night?
How do you walk with your head held high?
Dear Mr. President
You'd never take a walk with me
Would you?

[Verse 1]
I open up my heart
You can love me or not
There's no such thing as sin
Let it all come right in
I wanna make some mistakes, I wanna sleep in the mud
I wanna swim in the flood, I wanna fuck 'till I'm done
I like whiskey on ice, I like sun in my eyes
I wanna burn it all down, so let's start a fire
I wanna be lost, so lost that I'm found
Naked and laughing with my blood on the ground

[Chorus]
I am here, I am here
I've already seen the bottom, so there's nothing to fear
I know that I'll be ready when the devil is near
I am here, I am here
All of this wrong, but I'm still right here
I don't have the answers, but the question is clear

[Post-Chorus]
Let me ask you
Where does everybody go when they go?
Where does everybody go when they go?
Where does everybody go when they go?
Let me ask you
Where does everybody go when they go?
Where does everybody go when they go?
Where does everybody go when they go?
Let me ask you

[Verse 2]
May the light be upon me
May I feel in my bones that I am enough
I can make anywhere home
My fingers are clenched, my stomach's in knots
My heart it is racing, but afraid I am not
Afraid I am not

[Chorus]
I am here, I am here
I've already seen the bottom, so there's nothing to fear
I know that I'll be ready when the devil is near
Cause I am here, I am here
All of this wrong, but I'm still right here
I don't have the answers, but the question is clear

[Post-Chorus]
Let me ask you
Where does everybody go when they go?
Where does everybody go when they go?
Where does everybody go when they go?
Let me ask you
Where does everybody go when they go?
Where does everybody go when they go?
Where does everybody go when they go?
Let me ask you
Ohhh

[Bridge]
I can think of one thousand places
Much worse than this

[Chorus]
But I am here, I am here
I've already seen the bottom, so there's nothing to fear
I know that I'll be ready when the devil is near
Cause I am here, I am here
All of this wrong, but I'm still right here
I don't have the answers, but the question is clear

[Post-Chorus]
Let me ask you
Where does everybody go when they go?
Where does everybody go when they go?
Where does everybody go when they go?
Let me ask you
Where does everybody go when they go?
Where does everybody go when they go?
Where does everybody go when they go?
Oh, let me ask you
Oh, let me ask you
Ooh, ooh
So let me ask you

[Verse 1]
I don't wanna be the girl who laughs the loudest
Or the girl who never wants to be alone
I don't wanna be that call at four o'clock in the morning
Cause I'm the only one you know in the world that won't be home

[Pre-Chorus]
Ah, the sun is blinding
I stayed up again
Oh, I am finding
That's not the way I want my story to end

[Chorus]
I'm safe
Up high
Nothing can touch me
But why do I feel this party's over?
No pain
Inside
You're my protection
But how do I feel this good sober?

[Verse 2]
I don't wanna be the girl that has to fill the silence
The quiet scares me cause it screams the truth
Please don't tell me that we had that conversation
I won't remember, save your breath, cause what's the use?

[Pre-Chorus]
Ah, the night is calling
And it whispers to me softly come and play
Ah, I am falling
And If I let myself go I'm the only one to blame

[Chorus]
I'm safe
Up high
Nothing can touch me
But why do I feel this party's over? (Oh)
No pain
Inside
You're like perfection
But how do I feel this good sober?

[Break]
Coming down, coming down, coming down
Spinning round, spinning round, spinning round
Looking for myself, sober
Coming down, coming down, coming down
Spinning round, spinning round, spinning round
Looking for myself, sober

[Bridge]
When it's good, then it's good, it's so good 'till it goes bad
'Till you're trying to find the you that you once had
I have heard myself cry, never again
Broken down in agony, just tryna find a friend
Oh, oh

[Chorus]
I'm safe
Up high
Nothing can touch me (Nothing can touch me)
But why do I feel this party's over? (Why do I feel this party's over?)
No pain (no)
Inside (no)
You're like perfection
But how do I feel this good sober? (How do I feel this good sober?)
I'm safe
(No pain)
Up high
Nothing can touch me
But why do I feel this party's over? (Oh)
No pain
Inside
You're like perfection
But how do I feel this good sober? (How do I feel this good sober?)

[Intro]
Ok
(So)

[Verse 1]
Running like a dog
Fighting like I bitch too much
And you just can't stand it, baby
Even when I fall, you don't seem to give two shits
'Cause you're just too cool, baby
We could have it all
But neither one of us would budge
'Cause we can't be wrong, baby
Folding up your arms, closing up your heart

[Pre-Chorus 1]
I know, I know, I know, you think it's me
'Cause I want it all
No, I know, I know, I know, I know you see
That we gotta talk
You know, you know, you know, we must believe or fall apart

[Chorus]
I feel like our ship's going down tonight
But it's always darkest before the light
And that's enough for me to try
Whatever you want
Whatever you need
Whatever you do, ah-ah-ah
Even if I say that it's over now
Even if we want to move on somehow
And just like that we come alive
Whatever you want (ah)
Whatever you need (yeah)
Whatever you do, ah-ah-ah

[Verse 2]
Trying to get a breath
Thinkin' 'bout the time you said that I was your heart, baby
Trying to understand how a grown man goes on without a body part, baby
I could walk away
I could always cash my chips and I'd be ok, baby
I would be ok, and you might be ok

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Oh, I know, I know, I know you think it's me
But ya want it all
I know, I know, I know, I know you see
That we gotta talk
No, you know, you know, you must believe
You're enough for me

[Chorus]
I feel like our ship's going down tonight
But it's always darkest before the light
And that's enough for me to try
Whatever you want (yeah)
Whatever you need (ah)
Whatever you do, ah-ah-ah
Even if I say that it's over now
Even if we want to move on somehow
And just like that we come alive
Whatever you want (yeah)
Whatever you need (ah)
Whatever you do

[Bridge]
Whoever said that love was sweet
(Drank a little too much whiskey, baby)
Whoever said that life was easy
(Never lived anywhere near me)
I wouldn't change a thing
'Cause you're the one I wanna sink with

[Chorus]
I feel like our ship's going down tonight
But it's always darkest before the light
And that's enough
Even if I say that it's over now (it's over now)
Even if we want to (if we want to move on somehow)
Move on somehow
And just like that we come alive
Whatever you want
Whatever you need
Whatever you do, ah-ah-ah
Whatever you want (yeah)
Whatever you need (ah)
Whatever you do, oh-oh-oh
Whatever you want (yeah)
Whatever you need (oh)
Whatever you do, ah-ah-ah
Whatever you want
Whatever you need
Whatever you do, oh-oh-oh

[Chorus]
I'm comin' up, so you better get this party started
I'm comin' up, so you better get this party started

[Verse 1]
Get the party started on a Saturday night
Everybody's waiting for me to arrive
Sending out the message to all of my friends
We'll be looking flashy in my Mercedes Benz
I got lots of style, check my gold diamond rings
I can go for miles if you know what I mean

[Chorus]
I'm comin' up, so you better get this party started
(I'm comin' up, I'm comin')
I'm comin' up, so you better get this party started

[Verse 2]
Pumping up the volume, breaking down to the beat
Cruising through the west side, we'll be checking the scene
Boulevard is freaking as I'm coming up fast
I'll be burning rubber, you'll be kissing my ass
Pull up to the bumper, get out of the car
License plate says, "Stunner: #1 Superstar"

[Chorus]
I'm comin' up, so you better get this party started
(I'm comin' up, so you better)
I'm comin' up, so you better get this party started
Get this party started

[Verse 3]
Making my connection as I enter the room
Everybody's chillin' as I set up the groove
Pumping up the volume with this brand new beat
Everybody's dancing and they're dancing for me
I'm your operator, you can call anytime
I'll be your connection to the party line

[Chorus]
I'm comin' up, so you better get this party started
(I'm comin' up, I'm comin')
I'm comin' up, so you better get this party started
(I'm comin' up, I'm comin')
I'm comin' up, so you better get this party started
(I'm comin' up, so you better)
I'm comin' up, so you better get this party started
Get this party started (Ooh)
Get this party started right now
Get this party started (Ooh)
Get this party started
Get this party started right now

[Verse 1]
Right, right, turn off the lights
We're gonna lose our minds tonight
What's the dealio?
I love when it's all too much
5 A.M. turn the radio up
Where's the rock 'n roll?

[Pre-Chorus]
Party crasher, panty snatcher
Call me up if you're gangsta
Don't be fancy, just get dancy
Why so serious?

[Chorus]
So raise your glass if you are wrong
In all the right ways, all my underdogs
We will never be, never be anything but loud
And nitty, gritty, dirty, little freaks
Won't you come on and come on and
Raise your glass
Just come on and come on and
Raise your glass

[Verse 2]
Slam, slam, oh hot damn
What part of party don't you understand?
Wish you'd just freak out (Freak out already)
Can't stop, coming in hot
I should be locked up right on the spot
It's so on right now (It's so fuckin' on right now)

[Pre-Chorus]
Party crasher, panty snatcher
Call me up if you're gangsta
Don't be fancy, just get dancy
Why so serious?

[Chorus]
So raise your glass if you are wrong
In all the right ways, all my underdogs
We will never be, never be anything but loud
And nitty, gritty, dirty, little freaks
Won't you come on and come on and
Raise your glass
Just come on and come on and raise your glass
Won't you come on and come on and
Raise your glass
Just come on and come on and raise your glass

[Bridge]
Oh shit! My glass is empty
That sucks!
So if you're too school for cool (I mean)
And you're treated like a fool (Treated like a fool)
You can choose to let it go
We can always, we can always party on our own
So raise your (Ah, fuck)

[Chorus]
So raise your glass if you are wrong
In all the right ways, all my underdogs
We will never be, never be anything but loud
And nitty, gritty, dirty, little freaks
So raise your glass if you are wrong
In all the right ways, all my underdogs
We will never be, never be anything but loud
And nitty, gritty, dirty, little freaks
Won't you come on and come on and
Raise your glass
Just come on and come on and raise your glass
Won't you come on and come on and
Raise your glass for me
Just come on and come on and raise your glass
For me

[Intro]
High, high hopes

[Chorus]
Had to have high, high hopes for a living
Shooting for the stars when I couldn't make a killing
Didn't have a dime but I always had a vision
Always had high, high hopes (High, high hopes)
Had to have high, high hopes for a living
Didn't know how but I always had a feeling
I was gonna be that one in a million
Always had high, high hopes

[Verse 1]
Mama said, fulfill the prophecy
Be something greater, go make a legacy
Manifest destiny, back in the days
We wanted everything, wanted everything
Mama said, burn your biographies
Rewrite your history, light up your wildest dreams
Museum victories, every day
We wanted everything, wanted everything

[Pre-Chorus]
Mama said don't give up, it's a little complicated
All tied up, no more love and I'd hate to see you waiting

[Chorus]
Had to have high, high hopes for a living
Shooting for the stars when I couldn't make a killing
Didn't have a dime but I always had a vision
Always had high, high hopes
Had to have high, high hopes for a living
Didn't know how but I always had a feeling
I was gonna be that one in a million
Always had high, high hopes (High, high hopes)

[Verse 2]
Mama said, it's uphill for oddities
The stranger crusaders, ain't ever wannabes
The weird and the novelties don't ever change
We wanted everything, wanted everything (High, high hopes)

[Bridge]
Stay up on that rise
Stay up on that rise and never come down, oh
Stay up on that rise
Stay up on that rise and never come down

[Pre-Chorus]
Mama said don't give up, it's a little complicated
All tied up, no more love and I'd hate to see you waiting
They say it's all been done but they haven't seen the best of me-eh-eh-eh
So I got one more run and it's gonna be a sight to see-eh-eh-eh

[Bridge]
Had to have high, high hopes for a living
Shooting for the stars when I couldn't make a killing
Didn't have a dime but I always had a vision
Always had high, high hopes (High, high hopes)
Had to have high, high hopes for a living
Didn't know how but I always had a feeling
I was gonna be that one in a million
Always had high, high hopes (High, high hopes)

I was gonna be that one in a million
Always had high, high hopes (High, high hopes)

[Instrumental Intro]

[Verse 1]
Oh, well, imagine
As I'm pacing the pews in a church corridor
And I can't help but to hear
No, I can't help but to hear an exchanging of words
"What a beautiful wedding!
What a beautiful wedding!”, says a bridesmaid to a waiter
"And yes, but what a shame, what a shame
The poor groom's bride is a whore"

[Chorus]
I chime in with a "Haven't you people ever heard of
Closing the goddamn door?!"
No, it's much better to face these kinds of things
With a sense of poise and rationality
I chime in, "Haven't you people ever heard of
Closing the goddamn door?!"
No, it's much better to face these kinds of things
With a sense of...

[Verse 2]
Oh, well, in fact
Well, I'll look at it this way, I mean technically our
Marriage is saved, well, this calls for a toast
So pour the champagne
Oh! Well, in fact
Well, I'll look at it this way, I mean technically our
Marriage is saved, well, this calls for a toast
So pour the champagne, pour the champagne

[Chorus]
I chime in with a "Haven't you people ever heard of
Closing the goddamn door?!"
No, it's much better to face these kinds of things
With a sense of poise and rationality
I chime in, "Haven't you people ever heard of
Closing the goddamn door?!"
No, it's much better to face these kinds of things
With a sense of poise and rationality

[Bridge]
Again...

[Chorus]
I chime in "Haven't you people ever heard of
Closing the goddamn door?!"
No, it's much better to face these kinds of things
With a sense of poise and rationality
I chime in, "Haven't you people ever heard of
Closing the goddamn door?!"
No, it's much better to face these kinds of things
With a sense of poise and rationality

[Verse 1]
Do I look lonely? I see the shadows on my face
People have told me I don't look the same
Maybe I lost weight, I'm playing hooky with the best of the best
Pull my heart out my chest, so that you can see it too

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm walking the long road, watching the sky fall
The lace in your dress tangles my neck, how do I live?

[Chorus]
The death of a bachelor, o-o-oh! Letting the water fall
The death of a bachelor, o-o-oh! Seems so fitting for
Happily ever after, whooo, how could I ask for more?
A lifetime of laughter, at the expense of the death of a bachelor

[Verse 2]
I'm cutting my mind off, feels like my heart is going to burst
Alone at a table for two, and I just wanna be served
And when you think of me, am I the best you've ever had?
Share one more drink with me, smile even though you're sad

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm walking the long road, watching the sky fall
The lace in your dress tangles my neck, how do I live?

[Chorus]
The death of a bachelor, o-o-oh! Letting the water fall
The death of a bachelor, o-o-oh! Seems so fitting for
Happily ever after, whooo, how could I ask for more?
A lifetime of laughter at the expense of the death of a bachelor

[Instrumental Bridge]

[Chorus]
The death of a bachelor, o-o-oh! Letting the water fall
The death of a bachelor, o-o-oh! Seems so fitting for
Happily ever after, whooo, how could I ask for more?
A lifetime of laughter at the expense of the death of a bachelor

(Double-double-double down, pushing it all in)
Finders keepers, losers weepers
(Double-double-double down, pushing it all in)

[Verse 1]
Welcome to the end of eras, ice has melted back to life
Done my time and served my sentence
Dress me up and watch me die
If it feels good, tastes good, it must be mine
Dynasty decapitated, you just might see a ghost tonight

[Pre-Chorus]
(Double-double-double down, pushing it all in)
And if you don't know, now you know

[Chorus]
I'm taking back the crown
I'm all dressed up and naked
I see what's mine and take it
(Finders keepers, losers weepers), oh yeah
The crown, so close, I can taste it
I see what's mine and take it
(Finders keepers, losers weepers), oh yeah
(Double-double-double down, pushing it all in)

[Verse 2]
Sycophants on velvet sofas
Lavish mansions, vintage wine
I am so much more than royal
Snatch your chain and mace your eyes
If it feels good, tastes good, it must be mine
Heroes always get remembered
But you know legends never die

[Pre-Chorus]
(Double-double-double down, pushing it all in)
And if you don't know, now you know

[Chorus]
I'm taking back the crown
I'm all dressed up and naked
I see what's mine and take it

The crown, so close, I can taste it
I see what's mine and take it
(Finders keepers, losers weepers), oh, yeah

[Bridge]
Mortal kings are ruling castles
Welcome to my world of fun
Liars settle into sockets
Flip the switch and watch them run
Oh, yeah, oh, oh, oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh
(Finders keepers, losers weepers)

[Chorus]
I'm taking back, back, taking back, back the crown
I'm all dressed up and naked
I see what's mine and take it
(Finders keepers, losers weepers), oh, yeah
The crown, so close, I can taste it
I see what's mine and take it
(Finders keepers, losers weepers), oh, yeah

[Click here to read how Panic! At The Disco wrote “This Is Gospel”]

[Verse 1]
This is gospel, for the fallen ones
Locked away in permanent slumber
Assembling their philosophies
From pieces of broken memories

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
This is the beat of my heart, this is the beat of my heart
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
This is the beat of my heart, this is the beat of my heart
The gnashing teeth and criminal tongues conspire against the odds
But they haven't seen the best of us yet

[Chorus]
If you love me let me go (Oh-oh-oh-oh)
If you love me let me go (Oh-oh-o-oh-oh-oh)
'Cause these words are knives that often leave scars
The fear of falling apart
And truth be told I never was yours
The fear, the fear of falling apart

[Post-Chorus]
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
This is the beat of my heart, this is the beat of my heart
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
This is the beat of my heart, this is the beat of my...

[Verse 2]
This is gospel for the vagabonds
Ne'er-do-wells and insufferable bastards
Confessing their apostasies
Led away by imperfect impostors

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh (Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
This is the beat of my heart, this is the beat of my heart
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh (Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
This is the beat of my heart, this is the beat of my...
Don't try to sleep through the end of the world and bury me alive
'Cause I won't give up without a fight

[Chorus]
If you love me let me go (Oh-oh-oh-oh)
If you love me let me go (Oh-oh-o-oh-oh-oh)
'Cause these words are knives that often leave scars
The fear of falling apart
And truth be told I never was yours
The fear, the fear of falling apart

[Post-Chorus]
(Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
The fear of falling apart
(Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
The fear, the fear of falling apart
(Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
(This is the beat of my heart, this is the beat of my heart)
The fear of falling apart
(Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
(This is the beat of my heart, this is the beat of my heart)
The fear of falling apart
(Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
(This is the beat of my heart, this is the beat of my heart)
The fear of falling apart
(Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
(This is the beat of my heart, this is the beat of my...)
The fear of falling apart

[Intro]
Cold open

[Chopped Vocals]

[Verse 1]
Been trav'lin' in packs that I can't carry anymore
Been waitin' for somebody else to carry me
There's nothin' that's there for me at my door
All the people I know aren't who they used to be
And if I try to change my life one more day
There would be nobody else to save
And I can't change into a person I don't wanna be, so
Oh, it's Saturday night, yeah

[Chorus]
I pray for the wicked on the weekend
Mama, can I get another amen?
Oh, oh, it's Saturday night, yeah
Swear to God, I ain't ever gonna repent
Mama, can I get another amen?
Oh, oh, it's Saturday night, yeah

[Chopped Interlude]

[Verse 2]
And every mornin' when I wake up
I wanna be who I couldn't say I'd ever been
But it's so much more than I ever was
If every night I go to sleep knowin'
That I gave everything that I had to give
Then it's all I could've asked for
I've been standing up beside everything I've ever said, but
Oh, it's Saturday night, yeah

[Chorus]
I pray for the wicked on the weekend
Mama, can I get another amen?
Oh, oh, it's Saturday night, yeah
Swear to God, I ain't ever gonna repent
Mama, can I get another amen?
Oh, oh, it's Saturday night, yeah

[Bridge]
If I had one more day to wish
If I had one more day
To be better than I could have ever been
If I had one more day to wish
If I had one more day
I could be better, but, baby
Oh, it's Saturday night, yeah

[Chorus]
I pray for the wicked on the weekend
Mama, can I get another amen?
Oh, oh, it's Saturday night, yeah
Swear to God, I ain't ever gonna repent
Mama, can I get another amen?
Oh, oh, it's Saturday night, yeah

[Outro]
It's Saturday, Saturday, Saturday
Oh, oh, it's Saturday night, yeah
Swear to God, swear to God, swear to God
Oh, oh, it's Saturday night, yeah

[Verse 1]
I don't want to hear you got a boyfriend
Sometimes you're better off alone
But if you change your mind you know where I am
Yeah, if you change your mind you know where to find me
But I don't ever want to be your boyfriend

[Pre-Chorus]
And never did I think that I would be caught in the way you got me
Push another girl aside and just give in

[Chorus]
Girls love girls and boys, sophisticated, manipulated
Girls love girls and boys, sophisticated, manipulated
And never did I think that I would be caught in the way you got me
But girls love girls and boys, and love is not a choice

[Verse 2]
Pose, you've gotta save your reputation
They're close to finding out about your girlfriend
But if you change your mind you know where I am
Yeah, if you change your mind you know where to find me
But I don't want to save your reputation

[Pre-Chorus]
And never did I think that I would be caught in the way you got me
Push another girl aside and just give in

[Chorus]
Girls love girls and boys, sophisticated, manipulated
Girls love girls and boys, sophisticated, manipulated
And never did I think that I would be caught in the way you got me
But girls love girls and boys, and love is not a choice

[Bridge]
I'm just a villain vying for attention from a girl
A girl who can't decide, and here's the reason why

[Chorus]
Girls love girls and boys, sophisticated, manipulated
Girls love girls and boys, sophisticated, manipulated
Girls love girls and boys, sophisticated, manipulated
Girls love girls and boys, sophisticated, manipulated
And never did I think that I would be caught in the way you got me
But girls love girls and boys, and love is not a choice

[Intro]
Tonight we are victorious
Champagne pouring over us
All my friends we're glorious
Tonight we are victorious
Oh-oh-oh-oh, victorious
Oh-oh-oh-oh

[Verse 1]
Double bubble disco queen headed to the guillotine
Skin as cool as Steve McQueen, let me be your killer king
It hurts until it stops, we will love until it's not
I'm a killing spree in white, eyes like broken Christmas lights

[Pre-Chorus]
My touch is black and poisonous
And nothing like my punch-drunk kiss
I know you need it, do you feel it?
Drink the water, drink the wine

[Chorus]
Oh we gotta turn up the crazy
Livin' like a washed-up celebrity
Shooting fireworks like it's the Fourth of July
Until we feel alright
Until we feel alright

[Verse 2]
I'm like a scarf trick, it's all up the sleeve
I taste like magic, waves that swallow quick and deep
Throw the bait, catch the shark, bleed the water red
Fifty words for murder and I'm every one of them

[Pre-Chorus]
My touch is black and poisonous
And nothing like my punch-drunk kiss
I know you need it, do you feel it?
Drink the water, drink the wine

[Chorus]
Oh we gotta turn up the crazy
Livin' like a washed-up celebrity
Shooting fireworks like it's the Fourth of July

[Bridge]
Tonight we are victorious
Champagne pouring over us
All my friends we're glorious
Tonight we are victorious
Tonight we are victorious
Champagne pouring over us
All my friends we're glorious
Tonight we are victorious

[Chorus]
Oh we gotta turn up the crazy
Livin' like a washed-up celebrity
Shooting fireworks like it's the Fourth of July
Until we feel alright
Until we feel alright

[Outro]
Tonight we are victorious
Champagne pouring over us
All my friends we're glorious
Tonight we are victorious

[Verse 1]
You got two black eyes from loving too hard
And a black car that matches your blackest soul
I wouldn't change ya, oh
Wouldn't ever try to make you leave, no
Oh, the neon coast was your sign
And the Midwest wind with Pisces rising
Wouldn't change ya, oh
Wouldn't ever try to make you leave, no

[Pre-Chorus]
Static palms melt your vibe
Midnight whisperings

[Chorus]
The black magic on Mulholland Drive
Swimming pools under desert skies
Drinking white wine in the blushing light
Just another LA Devotee
Sunsets on the evil eye
Invisible to the Hollywood shrine
Always on the hunt for a little more time
Just another LA Devotee

[Post-Chorus]
Just another, just another, uh oh
Just another, just another, uh oh
Just another, just another, uh oh
Just another LA Devotee

[Verse 2]
You got bleached out eyes from the valley sand
And a black tar palm keeps weeping your name
I couldn't change ya, oh
Couldn't ever try to make you see, no
The high rise lights that read your rights
And a downtown storm with Aries rising
Couldn't change ya, oh
Couldn't ever try to make you see, no

[Pre-Chorus]
Static palms melt your vibe
Midnight whisperings

[Chorus]
The black magic on Mulholland Drive
Swimming pools under desert skies
Drinking white wine in the blushing light
Just another LA Devotee
Sunsets on the evil eye
Invisible to the Hollywood shrine
Always on the hunt for a little more time
Just another LA Devotee

[Post-Chorus]
Just another, just another, uh oh
Just another, just another, uh oh
Just another, just another, uh oh
Just another LA Devotee

[Bridge]
LA Devotee
LA Devotee
LA Devotee
LA Devotee

[Chorus]
The black magic on Mulholland Drive
Swimming pools under desert skies
Drinking white wine in the blushing light
Just another LA Devotee
Sunsets on the evil eye
Invisible to the Hollywood shrine
Always on the hunt for a little more time
Just another LA Devotee

[Post-Chorus]
Just another, just another, uh oh
Just another, just another, uh oh
Just another, just another, uh oh
Just another LA Devotee

[Verse 1]
Broadway is black like a sinkhole
Everyone raced to the suburbs
And I'm on the rooftop with curious strangers
This is the oddest of summers
Maybe I'll medicate, maybe inebriate
Strange situations, I get anxious
Maybe I'll smile a bit, maybe the opposite
But pray that they don't call me thankless

[Pre-Chorus]
My Tell-Tale Heart's a hammer in my chest
Cut me a silk tie tourniquet

[Chorus]
This is my roaring, roaring 20s
I don't even know me
Roll me like a blunt 'cause I wanna go home
Roll me like a blunt 'cause I wanna go home
My roaring, roaring 20s
I don't even know me
Roll me like a blunt 'cause I wanna go home
Roll me like a blunt 'cause I want, I wanna go home

[Verse 2]
Oscars and Emmys and Grammys
Everyone here is a trophy
And I'm sipping bourbon
The future's uncertain
The past on the pavement below me
Maybe I'll elevate, maybe I'm second rate
So unaware of my status
Maybe I'm overjoyed, maybe I'm paranoid
Designer me up in straight jackets

[Pre-Chorus]
My Tell-Tale Heart's a hammer in my chest
Cut me a silk tie tourniquet

[Chorus]
This is my roaring, roaring 20s
I don't even know me
Roll me like a blunt 'cause I wanna go home
Roll me like a blunt 'cause I wanna go home
My roaring, roaring 20s
I don't even know me
Roll me like a blunt 'cause I wanna go home
Roll me like a blunt 'cause I want, I wanna go home

[Bridge]
Hallucinations only mean that your brain is on fire
If it's Lord of the Flies in my mind tonight
I don't know if I will survive
Lighters up if you're feeling me
Fade to black if you're not mine
'Cause I just need a sign or a signal inside

[Chorus]
This is my roaring, roaring 20s
I don't even know me
Roll me a blunt 'cause I wanna go home
Roll me a, roll me a blunt
This is my roaring, roaring 20s
I don't even know me
Roll me like a blunt 'cause I wanna go home
Roll me like a blunt 'cause I want, I wanna go home

[Outro]
Oh-woah
Oh-woah
I wanna go home

[Hook]
Alright, alright
Alright, alright
Alright, alright, it's a Hell of a feeling though
It's a Hell of a feeling though
Alright, alright, it's a Hell of a feeling though
It's a Hell of a feeling though

[Verse 1]
Who are these people?
I just woke up in my underwear
No liquor left on the shelf
I should probably introduce myself
You shoulda' seen what I wore
I had a cane and a party hat
I was the king of this hologram
Where there's no such thing as getting out of hand
Memories tend to just pop up
Drunk pre-meds and some rubber gloves
Five-thousand people with designer drugs
Don't think I'll ever get enough
(Don't think I'll ever get enough)

[Audio sample from B52's "Rock Lobster"]

[Chorus]
Champagne, cocaine, gasoline
And most things in between
I roam the city in a shopping cart
A pack of camels and a smoke alarm
This night is heating up
Raise Hell and turn it up
Saying "If you go on, you might pass out in a drain pipe"
Oh yeah, don't threaten me with a good time

[Hook]
It's a Hell of a feeling though
It's a Hell of a feeling though
Alright, alright
It's a Hell of a feeling though
It's a Hell of a feeling though

[Verse 2]
What are these footprints?
They don't look very human-like
Now I wish that I could find my clothes
Bedsheets and a morning rose
I wanna wake up
Can't even tell if this is a dream
How did we end up in my neighbor's pool
Upside-down with a perfect view?
Bar to bar at the speed of sound
Fancy feet dancing through this town
Lost my mind in a wedding gown
Don't think I'll ever get it now
(Don't think I'll ever get it now)

[Chorus]
Champagne, cocaine, gasoline
And most things in between
I roam the city in a shopping cart
A pack of camels and a smoke alarm
This night is heating up
Raise Hell and turn it up
Saying "If you go all out you might pass out in a drain pipe"
Oh yeah, don't threaten me with a good time

[Bridge]
I'm a scholar and a gentleman
And I usually don't fall when I try to stand
I lost a bet to a guy in a Chiffon skirt
But I make these high heels work
I told you time and time again
I'm not as think as you drunk I am
And we all fell down
When the sun came up
I think we've had enough

[Hook]
Alright, alright, it's a Hell of a feeling though
It's a Hell of a feeling though
Alright, alright, it's a Hell of a feeling though
It's a Hell of a feeling though

[Chorus]
Champagne, cocaine, gasoline
And most things in between
I roam the city in a shopping cart
A pack of camels and a smoke alarm
This night is heating up
Raise Hell and turn it up
Saying "If you go all out you might pass out in a drain pipe"
Oh yeah, don't threaten me with a good time

[Verse 1]
All my life, been hustlin', and tonight is my appraisal
'Cause I'm a hooker sellin' songs, and my pimp's a record label
This world is full of demons, stocks and bonds and bible traders
So I do the deed, get up and leave, a climber and a sadist, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
Are you ready for the sequel?
Ain't ready for the latest?
In the garden of evil
I'm gonna be the greatest
In a golden cathedral
I'll be praying for the faithless
And if you lose, boo-hoo

[Chorus]
Hey look ma, I made it, hey look ma, I made it
Everything's comin' up aces, aces
If it’s a dream, don't wake me, don't wake me
I said, “Hey look ma, I made it”

[Verse 2]
Friends are happy for me or they're honeysuckle phonies
Then they celebrate my medals or they wanna take my trophies
Some are loyal soldiers while these other thorns are rosy
And if you never know who you can trust, then trust me, you'll be lonely, oh

[Pre-Chorus]
Are you ready for the sequel?
Ain't you ready for the latest?
In the garden of evil
I'm gonna be the greatest
In a golden cathedral
I'll be praying for the faithless
And if you lose, boo-hoo

[Chorus]
Hey look ma, I made it
Hey look ma, I made it
Everything's comin' up aces, aces
If it's a dream, don't wake me, don't wake me
I said, “Hey look ma, I made it, I made it”
I said, “Hey look ma, I made it, I made it”
I see it, I want it, I take it, take it
If it's a dream, don't wake me, don't wake me

[Outro]
I said, “Hey look ma, I made it”
(Mama best believe it, Mama best believe it)
Hey look ma, I made it
(Think I must be dreamin', wide awake and dreamin')
Hey look ma, I made it
(Mama best believe it, Mama best believe it)
Hey look ma, I made it
(Think I must be dreamin')
Hey look ma, I made it

[Verse 1]
Heaven knows that I'm born too late
For these ghosts that I chase
With these dreams, I inflate, painted skies in my brain
Every day, I'm Carl Sagan in space
To escape this old world, this old world
Some days I lie wide awake 'til the sun hits my face
And I fade, elevate from the Earth
Far away to a place where I'm free from the weight
This old world, this old world

[Pre-Chorus]
I don't trust anything
Or anyone, below the sun
And I don't feel anything
At all

[Chorus]
I'm king of the clouds, of the clouds
I get lifted, I get lifted
King of the clouds, of the clouds
I get lifted, I get lifted

[Verse 2]
Some only live to die, I'm alive to fly higher
Than angels in outfields inside of my mind
I'm ascendin' these ladders, I'm climbin', say goodbye
This old world, this old world
And when I fall to rise with stardust in my eyes
In the backbone of night, I'm combustible
Dust in the fire when I can't sleep a wink, I'm too tired
This old world, this old world

[Pre-Chorus]
I don't trust anything
Or anyone, below the sun
I don't feel anything
At all

[Chorus]
I'm king of the clouds, of the clouds
I get lifted, I get lifted
King of the clouds, of the clouds
I get lifted, I get lifted
Imagination, take me somewhere I don't know
I'm lost but I better find it alone
King of the clouds, of the clouds
I get lifted, I get lifted

[Outro]
I keep searching
Oh, I keep searching
I keep searching

[Verse 1]
The moment you arrived, they built you up
The sun was in your eyes, you couldn't believe it
Riches all around, you're walking
Stars are on the ground, you start to believe it

[Pre-Chorus]
Every face along the boulevard
Is a dreamer just like you
You looked at death in a tarot card
And you saw what you had to do

[Chorus]
But nobody knows you now, when you're dying in LA
And nobody owes you now, when you're dying in LA
When you're dying in LA, when you're dying in LA
The power, the power, the power
Oh, the power, the power, the power
Of LA

[Verse 2]
Nights at the chateau, trapped in your sunset bungalow
You couldn't escape it, yeah
Drink of paradise, they told you to put your blood on ice
You're not gonna make it

[Pre-Chorus]
Every face along the boulevard
Is a dreamer just like you
You looked at death in a tarot card
And you saw what you had to do

[Chorus]
But nobody knows you now, when you're dying in LA
And nobody owes you now, when you're dying in LA
When you're dying in LA, when you're dying in LA
The power, the power, the power
Oh, the power, the power, the power
Of LA

[Verse 1]
Is it still me that makes you sweat?
Am I who you think about in bed
When the lights are dim and your hands are shaking
As you're sliding off your dress?
Then think of what you did
And how I hope to God he was worth it
When the lights are dim and your heart is racing
As your fingers touch his skin

[Bridge]
I've got more wit, a better kiss, a hotter touch, a better fuck
Than any boy you'll ever meet, sweetie, you had me
Girl I was it, look past the sweat, a better love deserving of
Exchanging body heat in the passenger seat
No, no, no, you know it will always just be me

[Pre-Chorus]
Let's get these teen hearts beating faster, faster

[Chorus]
So testosterone boys and harlequin girls
Will you dance to this beat and hold a lover close?
So testosterone boys and harlequin girls
Will you dance to this beat and hold a lover close?

[Post-Chorus]
So, I guess we're back to us
Oh cameraman, swing the focus
In case I lost my train of thought
Where was it that we last left off? (Let's pick up and go)

[Verse 2]
Oh, now I do recall
We were just getting to the part
Where the shock sets in
And the stomach acid finds a new way to make you get sick
I hope you didn't expect
To get all of the attention
Now, let's not get selfish
Did you really think I'd let you kill this chorus?

[Pre-Chorus]
Let's get these teen hearts beating faster, faster

[Chorus]
So testosterone boys and harlequin girls
Will you dance to this beat and hold a lover close?
So testosterone boys and harlequin girls
Will you dance to this beat and hold a lover close?

Dance to this beat, dance to this beat
Dance to this beat
Let's get these teen hearts beating faster, faster

I've got more wit, a better kiss, a hotter touch, a better fuck
Than any boy you'll ever meet, sweetie, you had me
Girl I was it, look past the sweat, a better love deserving of
Exchanging body heat in the passenger seat
No, no, no, you know it will always just be me

[Intro: LOLO]
Climbing out the back door, didn't leave a mark
No one knows it's you, Miss Jackson
Found another victim
But no one's going to find Miss Jackson

[Verse 1: Brendon Urie]
You put a sour little flavor in my mouth now
You move in circles hoping no one's gonna find out
But we're so lucky, kiss the ring and let them bow down
Looking for the time of your life (no one's gonna find out)
A pretty picture but the scenery is so loud
A face like Heaven, catching lightning in your nightgown
But back away from the water, babe, you might drown
The party isn't over tonight (in your nightgown)

[Pre-Chorus: Brendon Urie]
Hey, where will you be waking up tomorrow morning?
Hey, out the back door, goddamn, but I love her anyway
I love her anyway, I love her anyway
Out the back door, goddamn, but I love her anyway

[Chorus: Brendon Urie]
Miss Jackson, Miss Jackson, Miss Jackson, are you nasty?
Miss Jackson, Miss Jackson, Miss Jackson, are you nasty?
Miss Jackson, Miss Jackson, Miss Jackson, are you nasty?
Are you nasty? I love her anyway

[Post-Chorus]
Oh, where will you be waking up tomorrow morning?
Oh, out the back door, goddamn, but I love her anyway

[Verse 2: Brendon Urie]
Way down until the fire finally dies out
You've got them wrapped around your finger, watch them fall down
There's something beautiful and tragic in the fall out
Let me say it one more time (tragic in the fall out)

[Pre-Chorus: Brendon Urie]
Hey, where will you be waking up tomorrow morning?
Hey, out the back door, goddamn, but I love her anyway
I love her anyway, I love her anyway
Out the back door, goddamn, but I love her anyway

[Chorus: Brendon Urie]
Miss Jackson, Miss Jackson, Miss Jackson, are you nasty?
Miss Jackson, Miss Jackson, Miss Jackson, are you nasty?
Miss Jackson, Miss Jackson, Miss Jackson, are you nasty?
Are you nasty? I love her anyway

[Post-Chorus]
Oh, where will you be waking up tomorrow morning?
Oh, out the back door, goddamn, but I love her any--

Climbing out the back door, didn't leave a mark
No one knows it's you, Miss Jackson
Found another victim
But no one's going to find Miss Jackson

Miss Jackson, Miss Jackson, Miss Jackson, are you nasty?
Miss Jackson, Miss Jackson, Miss Jackson, are you nasty?
Miss Jackson, Miss Jackson, Miss Jackson, are you nasty?
Are you nasty? I love her anyway

Ode to the old, and to the new
We rededicate this song to you

[Chorus]
Fuck a silver lining
Fuck a silver lining
'Cause only gold is hot enough, hot enough
Fuck a silver lining
Fuck a silver lining
'Cause only gold is hot enough, hot enough
One more, one more

[Verse 1]
It's just cherries, cherries
Everything is cherries on top
No wings of wax or endless mountains
Tragedies with penniless fountains
It's just cherries, cherries
It's coming up cherries on top
Sunset shadows through the trophies
I guess it just ain't big enough
Say it one more, one more, one more

[Chorus]
Fuck a silver lining
Fuck a silver lining
'Cause only gold is hot enough, hot enough
Fuck a silver lining
Fuck a silver lining
'Cause only gold is hot enough, hot enough

[Post-Chorus]
It's just cherries, cherries
Everything is cherries on top
It's just cherries, cherries
Everything is cherries on top
One more, one more

[Verse 2]
We've been falling, falling
It's like we fell to the top
I was born to cut a million
Cut my teeth and made a killing
Now I'm dodging, dodging
Everything you think that I'm not
Archetype of television
Was lost in thought but held the vision, hey

[Bridge]
When you gonna say my name?
When you gonna say my name?
Quick charade, Beyoncé, Lemonade
When you gonna say my name?
When you gonna say my name?
No delay, no halfway, let me hear you say
One more, one more, one more

[Chorus]
Silver lining
Fuck a silver lining
'Cause only gold is hot enough, hot enough
Fuck a silver lining
Fuck a silver lining
'Cause only gold is hot enough, hot enough

It's just cherries, cherries
Everything is cherries on top
It's just cherries, cherries
Everything is cherries on top

[Outro]
Silver lining
Fuck a silver lining
'Cause only gold is hot enough, hot enough

Kids, you have to remember I'm up here conducting you for a reason, okay? Watch me, watch my fingers. Here we go, ready? Watch me. One and, two and, three and, ready, go!

[Intro]
Dès le premier jour, ton parfum enivra mon amour
Et dans ces instants, j'aimerais être comme toi par moments
Mais depuis ce jour, je n'ai qu'un seul et unique regret...

[Verse 1]
My wing tips waltz across naive wood floors
They creak innocently down the stairs
Drag melody, my percussive
Feet serve cobweb headaches as a

[Pre-Chorus]
Matching set of marching clocks, the slumbering apparitions
That they've come to wake up

[Verse 2]
Here I am composing a burlesque out of where they rest their
Necks sunken in their splintered cradles
And ramshackle heads, they asked for it
As a girl

[Pre-Chorus]
You have set your heart on haunting me forever from the start
It's never silent

[Chorus]
Ever since we met, I only shoot up with your perfume
It's the only thing that makes me feel as good as you do
Ever since we met, I've got just one regret to live through
And that one regret is you

[Bridge]
How does a heart love if no one has noticed
Its presence, and where does it go?
Trembling hands play my heart like a drum
But the beat's gotten lost in the show

[Pre-Chorus]
You have set your heart on haunting me forever from the start
It's never silent

[Chorus]
Ever since we met, I only shoot up with your perfume
It's the only thing that makes me feel as good as you do
Ever since we met, I've got just one regret to live through
And I regret never letting you go!
Ever since we met, I only shoot up with your perfume
It's the only thing that makes me feel as good as you do
Ever since we met, I've got just one regret to live through
And that one regret is you!

[Outro]
Mona Lisa, pleased to please ya... (And that one regret is you!)
Mona Lisa, pleased to please ya... (And that one regret is you!)
Mona Lisa, pleased to please ya... (I've got just one...)
Ahhh...

[Verse 1]
It's the substandard motels on the la-la-la-la-la
Corner of 4th and Fremont Street
Appealing only 'cause they're just that unappealing
Any practiced Catholic would cross themselves upon entering
The rooms have a hint of asbestos and maybe
Just a dash of formaldehyde
And a habit of decomposing
Right before your very la-la-la-la eyes

[Chorus]
Along with the people inside, what a wonderful
Caricature of intimacy
Inside, what a wonderful
Caricature of intimacy

[Verse 2]
Tonight's tenants range from a lawyer and a virgin
Accessorizing with a rosary tucked inside her lingerie
She's getting a job at the firm come Monday
The Mrs. will stay with the cheating attorney
Moonlighting aside, she really needs his money
Oh, wonderful caricature of intimacy
Yeah, yeah
And not to mention the
Constable and his
Proposition for that “virgin”
Yes, the one the lawyer met with
On “strictly business,” as he said to the Mrs
Well, only hours before, after he had left
She was fixing her face in a compact
There was a terrible crash
There was a terrible crash
Between her and the badge
She spilled her purse and her bag
And held a purse of
A different kind

[Chorus]
Along with the people inside, what a wonderful
Caricature of intimacy
Inside, what a wonderful
Caricature of intimacy

[Bridge]
There are no... raindrops on roses and girls in white dresses
It's sleeping with roaches and taking best guesses
At the shade of the sheets and before all the stains
And a few more of your least favorite things
Raindrops on roses and girls in white dresses
It's sleeping with roaches and taking best guesses
At the shade of the sheets and before all the stains
And a few more of your least favorite things

[Chorus]
Inside, what a wonderful
Caricature of intimacy
Inside, what a wonderful
Caricature of intimacy

[Outro]
Raindrops on roses and girls in white dresses
It's sleeping with roaches and taking best guesses
At the shade of the sheets and before all the stains
And a few more of your least favorite things
Raindrops on roses and the girls in white dresses
And the sleeping with the roaches and the taking best guesses
At the shade of the sheets and before all the stains
And a few more of your least favorite things

[Intro]
Ohh!
A moment you'll never remember
And a night you'll never forget!
Ohh!

[Chorus]
All you sinners stand up, sing hallelujah (hallelujah!)
Show praise with your body
Stand up, sing hallelujah (hallelujah!)
And if you can't stop shaking, lean back
Let it move right through ya (hallelujah!)
Say your prayers
Say your prayers
Say your prayers
(Hallelujah!)

[Verse 1]
My life started the day I got caught
Under the covers
With secondhand lovers
Oh, tied up in pretty young things
In a state of emergency
Who was I trying to be

[Pre-Chorus]
Then the time for being sad is over
And you miss them like you miss no other
And being blue is better than being over it (over it)

[Chorus]
All you sinners stand up, sing hallelujah (hallelujah!)
Show praise with your body
Stand up, sing hallelujah (hallelujah!)
And if you can't stop shaking, lean back
Let it move right through ya (hallelujah!)
Say your prayers
Say your prayers
Say your prayers
(Hallelujah!)

[Verse 2]
I was drunk and it didn’t mean a thing
Stop thinking about
The bullets from my mouth
I love the things you hate about yourself
Just finished a daydream
Who were you trying to be?

[Pre-Chorus]
Then the time for being sad is over
And you miss them like you miss no other
And being blue is better than being over it (over it ohhhhh)

[Bridge]
No one wants you when you have no heart and
I’m sitting pretty in my brand new scars and
You’ll never know if you don’t ever try again
So let’s try
Let’s try
Let’s try


[Chorus]
All you sinners stand up, sing hallelujah (hallelujah!)
Show praise with your body
Stand up, sing hallelujah (hallelujah!)
And if you can't stop shaking, lean back
Let it move right through ya (hallelujah!)
Say your prayers
Say your prayers
Say your prayers
(Hallelujah!)

[Chorus]
All you sinners stand up, sing hallelujah (hallelujah!)
Show praise with your body
Stand up, sing hallelujah (hallelujah!)
And if you can't stop shaking, lean back
Let it move right through ya (hallelujah!)
Say your prayers
Say your prayers
Say your prayers

[Verse 1]
I wanna follow where she goes
I think about her and she knows it
I wanna let her take control
'Cause everytime that she gets close, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
She pulls me in enough to keep me guessing (Mmmm)
And maybe I should stop and start confessing, confessing, yeah

[Chorus]
Oh, I've been shaking
I love it when you go crazy
You take all my inhibitions
Baby, there's nothing holdin' me back
You take me places that tear up my reputation
Manipulate my decisions
Baby, there's nothing holdin' me back
There's nothing holdin' me back
There's nothing holdin' me back

[Verse 2]
She says that she's never afraid
Just picture everybody naked
She really doesn't like to wait
Not really into hesitation

[Pre-Chorus]
Pulls me in enough to keep me guessing
And maybe I should stop and start confessing, confessing, yeah

[Chorus]
Oh, I've been shaking
I love it when you go crazy
You take all my inhibitions
Baby, there's nothing holdin' me back
You take me places that tear up my reputation
Manipulate my decisions
Baby, there's nothing holdin' me back
There's nothing holdin' me back

[Bridge]
'Cause if we lost our minds and we took it way too far
I know we'd be alright, I know we would be alright
If you were by my side and we stumbled in the dark
I know we'd be alright, I know we would be alright
'Cause if we lost our minds and we took it way too far
I know we'd be alright, I know we would be alright
If you were by my side and we stumbled in the dark
I know we'd be alright, we would be alright

[Chorus]
Oh, I've been shaking
I love it when you go crazy
You take all my inhibitions
Baby, there's nothing holdin' me back
You take me places that tear up my reputation
Manipulate my decisions
Baby, there's nothing holdin' me back (Oh whoa)
There's nothing holdin' me back
I feel so free when you're with me, baby
Baby, there's nothing holdin' me back

[Intro]
Help me, it's like the walls are caving in
Sometimes I feel like giving up
But I just can't
It isn't in my blood

[Verse 1]
Laying on the bathroom floor, feeling nothing
I'm overwhelmed and insecure, give me something
I could take to ease my mind slowly
Just have a drink and you'll feel better
Just take her home and you'll feel better
Keep telling me that it gets better
Does it ever?

[Pre-Chorus]
Help me, it's like the walls are caving in
Sometimes I feel like giving up
No medicine is strong enough
Someone help me
I'm crawling in my skin
Sometimes I feel like giving up
But I just can't

[Chorus]
It isn't in my blood
It isn't in my blood

[Verse 2]
I'm looking through my phone again feeling anxious
Afraid to be alone again, I hate this
I'm trying to find a way to chill, can't breathe, oh
Is there somebody who could...

[Pre-Chorus]
Help me, it's like the walls are caving in
Sometimes I feel like giving up
No medicine is strong enough
Someone help me
I'm crawling in my skin
Sometimes I feel like giving up
But I just can't

[Chorus]
It isn't in my blood
It isn't in my blood

[Bridge]
I need somebody now
I need somebody now
Someone to help me out
I need somebody now

[Pre-Chorus]
Help me, it's like the walls are caving in
Sometimes I feel like giving up
But I just can't

[Chorus]
It isn't in my blood
It isn't in my blood, oh

[Outro]
It isn't in my blood
I need somebody now
It isn't in my blood
I need somebody now
It isn't in my blood

[Verse 1]
All it'd take is one flight
We'd be in the same time zone
Looking through your timeline
Seeing all the rainbows, I
I got an idea
And I know that it sounds crazy
I just wanna see ya
Oh, I gotta ask

[Chorus]
Do you got plans tonight?
I'm a couple hundred miles from Japan, and I
I was thinking I could fly to your hotel tonight
'Cause I-I-I can't get you off my mind
Can't get you off my mind
Can't get you off my mind (oh)

[Verse 2]
I could feel the tension
We could cut it with a knife
I know it's more than just a friendship
I can hear you think I'm right, yeah
Do I gotta convince you
That you shouldn't fall asleep?
It'll only be a couple hours
And I'm about to leave

[Chorus]
Do you got plans tonight?
I'm a couple hundred miles from Japan, and I
I was thinking I could fly to your hotel tonight
'Cause I-I-I can't get you off my mind
Can't get you off my mind
Can't get you off my mind
Do you got plans tonight?
I was hoping I could get lost in your paradise
The only thing I'm thinking 'bout is you and I
'Cause I-I-I can't get you off my mind
Can't get you off my mind
I can't seem to get you off my mind

[Bridge]
Let's get lost tonight (oh)
Let's get lost tonight
Baby, you and
I can't seem to get you off my mind
Let's get lost tonight
Let's get lost tonight
Baby, you and
I can't seem to get you off my mind
Oh-oh-oh-oh

[Chorus]
Do you got plans tonight?
I'm a couple hundred miles from Japan, and I
I was thinking I could fly to your hotel tonight
'Cause I-I-I can't get you off my mind
I can't get you off my mind
Do you got plans tonight, baby?
I was hoping I could get lost in your paradise
The only thing I'm thinking 'bout is you and I
And I-I-I can't get you off my mind
Can't get you off my mind
I can't seem to get you off my mind, yeah

[Outro]
Let's get lost tonight (oh)
Let's get lost tonight (oh)
Baby, you and
I can't seem to get you off my mind
Let's get lost tonight (oh)
Let's get lost tonight (oh)
Baby, you and
I can't seem to get you off my mind

[Verse 1]
I won't lie to you
I know he's just not right for you
And you can tell me if I'm off
But I see it on your face
When you say that he's the one that you want
And you're spending all your time
In this wrong situation
And anytime you want it to stop

[Chorus]
I know I can treat you better than he can
And any girl like you deserves a gentleman
Tell me why are we wasting time
On all your wasted crying
When you should be with me instead
I know I can treat you better
Better than he can

[Verse 2]
I'll stop time for you
The second you say you'd like me too
I just wanna give you the loving that you're missing
Baby, just to wake up with you
Would be everything I need and this could be so different
Tell me what you want to do

[Chorus]
'Cause I know I can treat you better than he can
And any girl like you deserves a gentleman
Tell me why are we wasting time
On all your wasted crying
When you should be with me instead
I know I can treat you better
Better than he can
Better than he can

[Bridge]
Give me a sign
Take my hand, we'll be fine
Promise I won't let you down
Just know that you don't
Have to do this alone
Promise I'll never let you down

[Chorus]
'Cause I know I can treat you better than he can
And any girl like you deserves a gentleman
Tell me why are we wasting time
On all your wasted crying
When you should be with me instead
I know I can treat you better
Better than he can
Better than he can
Better than he can

[Chorus]
I can't write one song that's not about you
Can't drink without thinkin' about you
Is it too late to tell you that
Everything means nothing if I can't have you?

[Verse 1]
I'm in Toronto and I got this view
But I might as well be in a hotel room, yeah
It doesn't matter 'cause I'm so consumed
Spending all my nights reading texts from you

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, I'm good at keeping my distance
I know that you're the feeling I'm missing
You know that I hate to admit it
But everything means nothing if I can't have you

[Chorus]
I can't write one song that's not about you
Can't drink without thinkin' about you
Is it too late to tell you that
Everything means nothing if I can't have you?
I can't write one song that's not about you
Can't drink without thinkin' about you
Is it too late to tell you that
Everything means nothing if I can't have you?

[Verse 2]
I'm so sorry that my timing's off
But I can't move on if we're still gonna talk
Is it wrong for me to not want half?
I want all of you, all the strings attached

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, I'm good at keeping my distance
I know that you're the feeling I'm missing
You know that I hate to admit it
But everything means nothing if I can't have you

[Chorus]
I can't write one song that's not about you
Can't drink without thinkin' about you
Is it too late to tell you that
Everything means nothing if I can't have you?
I can't write one song that's not about you
Can't drink without thinking about you
Is it too late to tell you that
Everything means nothing if I can't have you?

[Bridge]
I'm trying to move on, forget you, but I hold on
Everything means nothing, everything means nothing, babe
I'm trying to move on, forget you, but I hold on
Everything means nothing if I can't have you, no

[Chorus]
I can't write one song that's not about you
Can't drink without thinkin' about you
Is it too late to tell you that
Everything means nothing if I can't have you? (Can't have you)
I can't write one song that's not about you
Can't drink without thinking about you
Is it too late to tell you that
Everything means nothing if I can't have you?

[Verse 1]
You've got a hold on me
Don't even know your power
I stand a hundred feet
But I fall when I'm around ya
Show me an open door
And you go and slam it on me
I can't take anymore

[Chorus]
I'm saying
Baby, please have mercy on me
Take it easy on my heart
Even though you don't mean to hurt me
You keep tearing me apart
Would you please have mercy, mercy on my heart?
Would you please have mercy, mercy on my heart?

[Verse 2]
I'd drive through the night
Just to be near you, baby
Heart open, testify
Tell me that I'm not crazy
I'm not asking for a lot
Just that you're honest with me
And my pride, is all I got

[Chorus]
I'm saying
Baby, please have mercy on me
Take it easy on my heart
Even though you don't mean to hurt me
You keep tearing me apart
Would you please have mercy on me?
I'm a puppet on your strings
And even though you got good intentions
I need you to set me free
Would you please have mercy, mercy on my heart?
Would you please have mercy, mercy on my heart?

[Bridge]
Consuming all the air inside my lungs
Ripping all the skin from off my bones
I'm prepared to sacrifice my life
I would gladly do it twice
Consuming all the air inside my lungs
Ripping all the skin from off my bones
I'm prepared to sacrifice my life
I would gladly do it twice

[Chorus]
Oh, please have mercy on me
Take it easy on my heart
Even though you don't mean to hurt me
You keep tearing me apart
Would you please have mercy on me?
I'm a puppet on your string
And even though you got good intentions
I need you to set me free
I'm begging you for mercy, mercy
I'm begging you, begging you, please, baby
I'm begging you for mercy, mercy
Ooh, I'm begging you, I'm begging you

[Music Video]

[Verse 1]
I thought that I've been hurt before
But no one's ever left me quite this sore
Your words cut deeper than a knife
Now I need someone to breathe me back to life

[Pre-Chorus]
Got a feeling that I'm going under
But I know that I'll make it out alive
If I quit calling you my lover
Move on

[Chorus]
You watch me bleed until I can't breathe, shaking
Falling onto my knees
And now that I'm without your kisses
I'll be needing stitches
Tripping over myself, aching
Begging you to come help
And now that I'm without your kisses
I'll be needing stitches

[Verse 2]
Just like a moth drawn to a flame
Oh, you lured me in I couldn't sense the pain
Your bitter heart, cold to the touch
Now I'm gonna reap what I sow
I'm left seeing red on my own

[Pre-Chorus]
Got a feeling that I'm going under
But I know that I'll make it out alive
If I quit calling you my lover
Move on

[Chorus]
You watch me bleed until I can't breathe, shaking
Falling onto my knees
And now that I'm without your kisses
I'll be needing stitches
Tripping over myself, aching
Begging you to come help
And now that I'm without your kisses
I'll be needing stitches

[Bridge]
Needle and the thread, gotta get you out of my head
Needle and the thread, gonna wind up dead
Needle and the thread, gotta get you out of my head
Needle and the thread, gonna wind up dead
Needle and the thread, gotta get you out of my head
Needle and the thread, gonna wind up dead
Needle and the thread, gotta get you out of my head
Get you out of my head

[Chorus]
You watch me bleed until I can't breathe, shaking
Falling onto my knees
And now that I'm without your kisses
I'll be needing stitches
Tripping over myself, aching
Begging you to come help
And now that I'm without your kisses
I'll be needing stitches

[Outro]
Now that I'm without your kisses
I'll be needing stitches
Now that I'm without your kisses
I'll be needing stitches

[Verse 1: Shawn Mendes & Khalid]
Here I am, stuck on this couch scrolling through my notes
Heart was broken, still not growing, nah
Waking up to headlines, filled with devastation again
My heart is broken, but I keep going

[Pre-Chorus: Shawn Mendes with Khalid]
Pain, but I won't let it turn into  hate
No, I won't let it change me
Never losing sight of the one I keep inside
Now, I know it, yeah, I know it

[Chorus: Shawn Mendes & Khalid]
You can't take my youth away
This soul of mine will never break
As long as I wake up today
You can't take my youth away
You can't take my youth away
This soul of mine will never break
As long as I wake up today
You can't take my youth away

[Post-Chorus: Shawn Mendes & Khalid]
You can't take my youth away

[Verse 2: Shawn Mendes & Khalid]
It's hard to sleep at night, knowing what's outside
Feeling hopeless, I need focus
You hit me with words I never heard come out your mouth
To be honest, I don't want it, no

[Pre-Chorus: Shawn Mendes, & Khalid]
Pain, but I won't let it turn into hate
No, I won't let it change me

[Chorus: Shawn Mendes & Khalid]
You can't take my youth away
This soul of mine will never break
As long as I wake up today
You can't take my youth away
You can't take my youth away
This soul of mine will never break
As long as I wake up today
You can't take my youth away

[Post-Chorus: Shawn Mendes & Khalid]
You can't take my youth away (can't take my youth)
You can't take my youth away
Oh, yeah

[Bridge: Khalid & Shawn Mendes]
Pain, but I won't let it turn into hate
No, I won't let it change me
Pain, but I won't let it turn into hate
No, I won't let it change me

[Chorus: Shawn Mendes & Khalid]
You can't take my youth away
This soul of mine will never break
As long as I wake up today
You can't take my youth  away (my youth away)
You can't take my youth away
This soul of mine will never break
As long as I wake up today
You can't take my youth away (oh yeah)
You can't take my youth away
This soul of mine will never break
As long as I wake up today
You can't take my youth away
You can't take my youth away
This soul of mine will never break
As long as I wake up today
You can't take my youth away
You can't take my youth away

[Verse 1]
Sunrise with you on my chest
No blinds in the place where I live
Daybreak open your eyes
'Cause this was only ever meant to be for one night
Still, we're changing our minds here
Be yours, be my dear
So close with you on my lips
Touch noses, feeling your breath
Push your heart and pull away, yeah
Be my summer in a winter day, love
I can't see one thing wrong
Between the both of us
Be mine, be mine, yeah
Anytime, anytime

[Pre-Chorus]
Ooh, you know I've been alone for quite a while, haven't I
I thought I knew it all
Found love but I was wrong
More times than enough
But since you came along
I'm thinking, baby

[Chorus]
You, are bringing out a different kind of me (yeah)
There's no safety net that's underneath
I'm free
Fallin’ all in you
Fell for men who weren't how they appear (yeah)
Trapped up on a tightrope now we're here
We're free
Fallin’ all in you

[Verse 2]
Fast forward a couple years, yeah
Grown up in the place that we live
Make love, then we fight
Laugh 'cause it was only meant to be for one night, baby
I guess we can't control
What's just not up to us
Be mine, be mine, yeah
Anytime, anytime

[Pre-Chorus]
Ooh, you know I've been alone for quite a while, haven't I
I thought I knew it all
Found love but I was wrong
More times than enough
But since you came along
I'm thinking, baby

[Chorus]
You, are bringing out a different kind of me (yeah, ooh)
There's no safety net that's underneath
I'm free
Fallin' all in you (ooh)
Fell for men who weren't how they appear (ooh)
Trapped up on a tightrope now we're here
We're free
Fallin' all in you

[Bridge]
Every time I see you, baby, I get lost
If I'm dreaming, baby, please don't wake me up
Every night I'm with you I fall more in love
Now I'm laying by your side
Everything feels right since you came along
I'm thinking, baby

[Chorus]
You, yeah, are bringing out a different kind of me (ooh)
There's no safety net that's underneath
I'm free
Fallin' all in you (ooh)
Fell for men who weren't how they appear (ooh)
Trapped up on a tightrope now we're here
We're free
Fallin' all in...

[Verse 1]
You said, "I wanna get to know ya"
Why you gotta get my hopes up?
You said that you were staying over
But then I woke up to the cold air

[Refrain]
How could you make me believe?
That there was something in between you and me, yeah
I look around and I don't see you

[Chorus]
Where were you in the morning, baby?
You didn't leave your number for me
Left me without a warning, waitin'
Where were you in the morning, baby?

[Post-Chorus]
How do you, how do you just walk away?
How do you, how do you just walk away?

[Verse 2]
And I thought you really felt this
When we were talking about breakfast
You made it seem like we connected
I guess I just didn't expect this

[Refrain]
How could you make me believe?
That there was something in between you and me, yeah
I look around and I don't see you

[Chorus]
Where were you in the morning, baby?
You didn't leave your number for me
Left me without a warning, waitin'
I said where were you in the morning, baby?

[Post-Chorus]
How do you, how do you just walk away?
Where were, where were you?
How do you, how do you just walk away?
Where were, where were you?

[Bridge]
And I hope you had a good reason
'Cause I know you had a good time
And I'm looking up at the ceiling
And I keep wondering why

[Chorus]
Where were you in the morning, baby?
Where were you in the morning?
You didn't leave your number for me
You didn't leave your number
Left me without a warning, waitin'
Left me without a warning
I said, where were you in the morning baby?
Where were you in the morning?

[Post-Chorus]
How do you, how do you just walk away?
Where were, where were you?
How do you, how do you just walk away?
Where were, where were you?
How do you, how do you just walk away?
Where were, where  were you?
How do you, how do you just walk away?
Where were, where were you?

[Verse 1]
I saw you on a Sunday in a café
And all you did was look my way
And my heart started to race
And my hands started to shake, yeah
I heard you asked about me through a friend
My adrenaline kicked in
'Cause I've been askin' 'bout you too
And now we're right here in this room

[Chorus]
I get a little bit nervous around you
Get a little bit stressed out when I think about you
Get a little excited
Baby, when I think about you, yeah
Talk a little too much around you
(I talk a little too much, yeah)
Get a little self-conscious when I think about you
(I get a little self-conscious)
Get a little excited
(I get a little excited)
Baby, when I think about you, yeah
Yeah, when I think about you, babe

[Verse 2]
We walked in the rain a couple blocks to your apartment
You told me to come inside, caught me staring in your eyes
And I'm not usually like this
But I like what you're doing to me, ah, what you're doing to me

[Chorus]
I get a little bit nervous around you
(I get a little bit nervous)
Get a little bit stressed out when I think about you
(I get a little bit stressed out)
Get a little excited
(I get a little excited)
Baby, when I think about you, yeah
Yeah, when I think about you, babe (oh yeah)
Talk a little too much around you
(I talk a little too much, yeah)
Get a little self-conscious when I think about you
(I get a little self-conscious)
Get a little excited
(I get a little excited)
Baby, when I think about you
Yeah, when I think about you, babe

[Bridge]
You got me acting like I've never done this before
I promise I'll be ready when I walk through the door
And I don't know why
No, I don't know why
Yeah

[Chorus]
I get a little bit nervous around you
(I get a little bit nervous)
Get a little bit stressed out when I think about you
(I get a little bit stressed out)
Get a little excited
(I get a little excited)
Baby, when I think about you
Yeah, when I think about you, babe
Talk a little too much around you
(I talk a little too much, baby)
Get a little self-conscious when I think about you
(I get a little self-conscious)
Get a little excited
(I get a little excited)
Baby, when I think about you
Yeah, when I think about you, babe

[Verse 1]
Oh, there she goes again, every morning it's the same
You walk on by my house, I wanna call out your name
I wanna tell you how beautiful you are from where I'm standin'
You got me thinkin' what we could be 'cause

[Pre-Chorus]
I keep craving, craving, you don't know it but it's true
Can't get my mouth to say the words they wanna say to you
This is typical of love, I can't wait anymore, won't wait
I need to tell you how I feel when I see us together forever

[Chorus]
In my dreams you're with me, we'll be everything I want us to be
And from there, who knows?
Maybe this will be the night that we kiss for the first time
Or is that just me and my imagination?

[Verse 2]
We walk, we laugh, we spend our time walking by the ocean side
Our hands are gently intertwined, a feeling I just can't describe
And all this time we spent alone thinkin' we cannot belong
To something so damn beautiful, so damn beautiful

[Pre-Chorus]
I keep craving, craving, you don't know it but it's true
Can't get my mouth to say the words they wanna say to you
This is typical of love, I can't wait anymore, won't wait
I need to tell you how I feel when I see us together forever

[Chorus]
In my dreams you're with me, we'll be everything I want us to be
And from there, who knows?
Maybe this will be the night that we kiss for the first time
Or is that just me and my imagination? (Woah, oh)

[Bridge]
Imagination (Woah, oh, woah, oh)
Imagination (Woah, oh)
(Woah, oh, woah, oh, woah, oh, ooh)

[Chorus]
In my dreams you're with me, we'll be everything I want us to be
And from there, who knows?
Maybe this will be the night that we kiss for the first time
Or is that just me and my imagination?

[Outro]
I keep craving, craving, you don't know it but it's true
Can't get my mouth to say the words they wanna say to you

[Verse 1]
I love it when you just don't care
I love it when you dance like there's nobody there
So when it gets hard, don't be afraid
We don't care what them people say
I love it when you don't take no
I love it when you do what you want 'cause you just said so
Let them all go home, we out late
We don't care what them people say

[Chorus]
We don't have to be ordinary
Make your best mistakes
'Cause we don't have the time to be sorry
So baby be the life of the party
I'm telling you to take your shot it might be scary
Hearts are gonna break
'Cause we don't have the time to be sorry
So baby be the life of the party

[Verse 2]
Together we can just let go
Pretend like there's no one else here that we know
Slow dance fall in love as the club track plays
We don't care what them people say

[Chorus]
We don't have to be ordinary
Make your best mistakes
'Cause we don't have the time to be sorry
So baby be the life of the party
I'm telling you to take your shot it might be scary
Hearts are gonna break
'Cause we don't have the time to be sorry
So baby be the life of the party

[Bridge]
Come out tonight, come out tonight
There's no one standing in your way
Come out tonight, come out tonight
We don't care what them people say
We don't care what them people say

[Chorus]
We don't have to be ordinary
Make your best mistakes
'Cause we don't have the time to be sorry
So baby be the life of the party
I'm telling you to take your shot it might be scary
Hearts are gonna break
'Cause we don't have the time to be sorry
So baby be the life of the party

[Outro]
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Life of the party
So don't let them keep you down
Oh you know you can't give up
'Cause we don’t have the time to be sorry
So baby be the life of the party

[Verse 1]
Taste the poison from your lips
Lately, we're as good as gone
Oh, our love is drunken in
Singing me my favorite song

[Pre-Chorus]
Me and you
We were made to break
I know the truth
But it's much too late

[Chorus]
You're perfectly wrong for me
And that's why it's so hard to leave
Yeah, you're perfectly wrong for me
You're perfectly wrong for me
All the stars in the sky could see
Why you're perfectly wrong for me

[Verse 2]
Oh, you know how much it hurts
Every time you say you hate me
But when we're making love, you make it worth it
I can't believe the places that you take me

[Pre-Chorus]
There's no use
We were made to break
I know the truth
And it's much too late

[Chorus]
You're perfectly wrong for me
And that's why it's so hard to leave
Yeah, you're perfectly wrong for me
Oh, you're perfectly wrong for me
All the stars in the sky could see
Why you're perfectly wrong for me

[Bridge]
Oh, and why can't I quit
When you break my heart open
I need you more than I know
Oh, and I can't resist
When you're up against my skin
I never wanna let you go

[Chorus]
You're perfectly wrong for me
And that's why it's so hard for me
Yeah, you're perfectly wrong for me, mhm
Yeah, you're perfectly wrong for me
Hate that you know that I won't leave
Yeah, you're perfectly wrong for me, oh
Yeah, you're perfectly wrong for me
And that's why it's so hard for me
Yeah, you're perfectly wrong for me, yeah
Oh, you're perfectly wrong for me
Hate that you know that I won't leave
Yeah, you're perfectly wrong for me
Yeah, you're perfectly wrong for me

[Verse 1]
I know a girl, she's like a curse
We want each other, no one will break first
So many nights, trying to find someone new
They don't mean nothing compared to her, and I know

[Pre-Chorus]
When people ask about us, now, we just brush it off
I don't know why we act like it means nothing at all
I wish that I could tell you that you're all that I want, yeah

[Chorus]
I pretend that
I'm not ready
Why do we put each other through hell?
Why can't we just get over ourselves?
And you say "hi" like
You just met me
Why do we put each other through hell?
Why can't we just get over ourselves?
Why can't we just get over ourselves?

[Verse 2]
When I hear you sing, it gets hard to breathe
Can't help but think every song's about me
And every line, every word that I write
You are the muse in the back of my mind, oh

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't wanna ask about it 'cause you might brush it off
I'm afraid you think that it means nothing at all
I don't know why I won't admit that you're all I want

[Chorus]
I pretend that
I'm not ready
Why do we put each other through hell?
Why can't we just get over ourselves?
And you say "hi" like
You just met me
Why do we put each other through hell?
Why can't we just get over ourselves?

[Instrumental]

[Chorus]
I pretend that
I'm not ready
Why do we put each other through hell?
Why can't we just get over ourselves?
And you say "hi" like
You just met me
Why do we put each other through hell?
Why can't we just get over ourselves?

[Outro]
I know a girl, she's like a curse
We want each other, no one will break first
So many nights, trying to find someone new
They don't mean nothing compared to you

[Verse 1: Shawn Mendes]
"Don't cry" - or do
Whatever makes you comfortable
I’m tired too, there's nothin' left to say
Let’s call the truce, 'cause I don't really wanna go to bed like this

[Pre-Chorus: Shawn Mendes]
I'm so sorry
That we're still stuck in the middle
I'm so sorry
'Cause in the moment I

[Chorus: Shawn Mendes & Julia Michaels]
I don't know what it’s like to be you
I don’t know what it's like but I’m dying to
If I could put myself in your shoes
Then I'd know what it's like to be you

[Verse 2: Julia Michaels]
Can I kiss you or not? 'Cause I’m not really sure right now of what you want
Are you still mad at me?
I'm hopin' not
'Cause maybe we could go to the movies, I know that always cheers us up, hey

[Pre-Chorus: Shawn Mendes & Julia Michaels]
I'm so sorry
That we're still stuck in the middle
Yeah, I'm so sorry
'Cause in the moment I

[Chorus: Shawn Mendes & Julia Michaels]
I don't know what it's like to be you
I don't know what it's like but I'm dying to
If I could put myself in your shoes
Then I'd know what it's like to be you
Tell me what's inside of your head
No matter what you say I won't love you less
And I'd be lying if I said that I do
I don't know what it's like to be you
I don't know what it's like to be you

[Bridge: Shawn Mendes & Julia Michaels]
I get worried
I might lose you a little
Every time we
Every time we argue and get caught up in the moment

[Chorus: Shawn Mendes & Julia Michaels]
I don't know what it's like to be you
I don't know what it's like but I'm dying to
If I could put myself in your shoes
Then I'd know what it's like to be you
So tell me what's inside of your head
No matter what you say I won't love you less
And I'd be lying if I said that I do
I don't know what it's like to be you
I don't know what it's like to be you
I don't know what it's like

[Verse 1]
I think it's time to be honest
Should've told you not to go
Thought I knew just what I wanted
I didn't know myself at all

[Pre-Chorus]
You're with somebody I can't be, yeah
But I can tell that you're happy

[Chorus]
It's time for me to finally meet somebody new
Take her to all the places that I took us to
And she might help me forget
But loving her is something I could never do
Because I had, because I had you

[Verse 2]
Hey, remember when I told you
That you and I will go down in history together, yeah
And does your sister ask about me?
You and I, what we had, is it gone forever?

[Pre-Chorus]
You're with somebody I can't be
But I can tell that you're happy

[Chorus]
It's time for me to finally meet somebody new
Take her to all the places that I took us to
And she might help me forget but loving her is something I could never do
Because I had, because I had you

[Bridge]
There's nothin', oh
There's nothin' left to lose (ooh)
Because I had you, babe
There's nothin'
Nothin' that I could do (ooh)
I wish I had you

[Chorus]
But I think it's time I finally found somebody new
And tell myself that she's the one to get me through
And she might help me forget but loving her is something I just couldn't do
Because I had you

[Intro Whistling]

[Verse 1]
I promise that one day I'll be around
I'll keep you safe, I'll keep you sound
Right now it's pretty crazy
And I don't know how to stop or slow it down

[Pre-Chorus]
Hey, I know there are some things we need to talk about
And I can't stay, just let me hold you for a little longer now

[Chorus]
Take a piece of my heart and make it all your own
So when we are apart, you'll never be alone, you'll never be alone

[Verse 2]
You'll never be alone
When you miss me close your eyes
I may be far, but never gone
When you fall asleep tonight, just remember that we lay under the same stars

[Pre-Chorus]
Hey, I know there are some things we need to talk about
And I can't stay, just let me hold you for a little longer now

[Chorus]
And take a piece of my heart and make it all your own
So when we are apart, you'll never be alone, you'll never be alone

[Bridge]
You'll never be alone, you'll never be alone
You'll never be alone, you'll never be alone
You'll never be alone, you'll never be alone

[Chorus]
And take a piece of my heart and make it all your own
So when we are apart, you'll never be alone, you will never be alone

[Verse 1]
It's not that I'm afraid I'm not enough for her
It's not that I can't find the words to say
But when she's with him, she seems happier
And I don't want to take that away

[Pre-Chorus]
How many times can I see your face?
How many times will you walk away?
I just have to let you know

[Chorus]
I'm not tryna start a fire, with this flame
But I'm worried that your heart might feel the same
And I have to be honest with you baby
Tell me if I'm wrong, and this is crazy
But I got you this rose
And I need to know
Will you let it die or let it grow?
Die or let it go?

[Verse 2]
It's not that I don't care about the love you have
It's not that I don't want to see you smile
But there's no way that he can feel the same
'Cause when I think of you my mind goes wild

[Pre-Chorus]
How many times can I see your face?
How many times will you walk away?
I just have to let you know

[Chorus]
I'm not tryna start a fire, with this flame
But I'm worried that your heart might feel the same
And I have to be honest with you baby
Tell me if I'm wrong, this is crazy
But I got you this rose
And I need to know
Will you let it die or let it grow?

[Bridge]
You can tell me stop, if you already know
Though I'm not sure my heart can take it
But the look on your face says, don't let me go

[Chorus]
I'm not tryna start a fire, with this flame
But I'm worried that your heart might feel the same
And I have to be honest with you baby
Tell me if I'm wrong, this is crazy
But I got you this rose
And I need to know
Will you let it die or let it go?
I'm not tryna start a fire, with this flame
But I'm worried that your heart might feel the same
And I have to be honest with you baby
Tell me if I'm wrong, this is crazy
But I got you this rose
And I need to know
Will you let it die or let it grow?

[Verse 1]
Maybe I had too many drinks, but that's just what I needed
I hope that you don't think that what I'm saying sounds conceited
When I look across the room and you're staring right back at me
Like somebody told a joke and we're the only ones laughin'

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't know why I try 'cause ain't nobody like you
Familiar disappointment every single time I do
And every single night my arms are not around you
My mind's still wrapped around you

[Chorus]
Baby, tell me when you're ready
I'm waitin'
Baby, anytime you're ready
I'm waitin'
Even ten years from now, if you haven't found somebody
I promise I'll be around
Tell me when you're ready
I'm waitin'

[Verse 2]
What if my dad is right when he says that you're the one
No, I can't even argue, I won't even fight him on it
Call you when it's late and I know that you're in bed
'Cause I'm three hours back, seems like you're always six ahead

[Pre-Chorus]
And I don't know why I try 'cause ain't nobody like you
Familiar disappointment every single time I do
And every single night my arms are not around you
My mind's still wrapped around you

[Chorus]
Baby, tell me when you're ready
I'm waitin'
Baby, anytime you're ready
I'm waitin'
Even ten years from now, if you haven't found somebody
I promise I'll be around
Tell me when you're ready
I'm waitin', yeah

[Bridge]
And if I have to, I'll wait forever
Say the word and I'll change my plans
Yeah, you know that we fit together
I know your heart like the back of my hand

[Chorus]
So baby, tell me when you're ready
I'm waitin'
Baby, any time you're ready
I'm waitin', yeah
Even ten years from now, if you haven't found somebody
I promise I'll be around
Tell me when you're ready
I'm waitin', yeah
Baby, tell me when you're ready
I'm waitin'
Baby, any time you're ready
I'm waitin', oh
Even ten years from now, if you haven't found somebody
I promise I'll be around
Tell me when you're ready
I'm waitin', I'm waitin'
