[Intro]
Why men great 'til they gotta be great?
Woo!

[Verse 1]
I just took a DNA test, turns out I'm 100% that bitch
Even when I'm crying crazy
Yeah, I got boy problems, that's the human in me
Bling bling, then I solve 'em, that's the goddess in me
You coulda had a bad bitch, non-committal
Help you with your career just a little
You're 'posed to hold me down, but you're holding me back
And that's the sound of me not calling you back

[Chorus]
Why men great 'til they gotta be great? ('Til they gotta be great)
Don't text me, tell it straight to my face (Tell it straight to my face)
Best friend sat me down in the salon chair (Down in the salon chair)
Shampoo press, get you out of my hair
Fresh photos with the bomb lighting (With the bomb lighting)
New man on the Minnesota Vikings (Minnesota Vikings)
Truth hurts, needed something more exciting (Yee)
Bom bom bi dom bi dum bum bay (Eh, yeah, yeah, yeah)

[Verse 2]
You tried to break my heart?
Oh, that breaks my heart
That you thought you ever had it
No, you ain't from the start
Hey, I'm glad you're back with your bitch
I mean, who would wanna hide this?
I will never, ever, ever, ever, ever be your side chick
I put the sing in single
Ain't worried 'bout a ring on my finger
So you can tell your friend, "Shoot your shot" when you see him
It's okay, he already in my DMs

[Chorus]
Why men great 'til they gotta be great? ('Til they gotta be great)
Don't text me, tell it straight to my face (Tell it straight to my face)

Even if there ain't no precedent, switchin' up the messaging
I'm about to add a little estrogen
Buy my whip by myself, pay my rent by myself
Only exes that I care about are in my fucking chromosomes
I don't really need you, I'm Macaulay Culkin, home alone
Bad bitch, diamonds in my collarbone (Yee, yee)
Buy my whip by myself, pay my rent by myself

[Pre-Chorus]
Sugar, spice, and I'm nice

[Outro]
Shit, fuck, I didn't know it was ending right there

[Intro]
True story
No glory, let's go

[Verse 1]
Yeah, the old me used to love a Gemini
Like a threesome, fuckin' with him every night
A lotta two-faced people show me both sides
So I figured out I gotta be my own type

[Pre-Chorus 1]
They used to say to get a man, you had to know how to look
They used to say to keep a man, you had to know how to cook
But I'm solo in Soho, sippin' Soju in Malibu
It's a me, myself kinda attitude

[Chorus]
'Cause I'm my own soulmate (Yeah, yeah)
I know how to love me (Love me)
I know that I'm always gonna hold me down
Yeah, I'm my own soulmate (Yeah, yeah)

Look up in the mirror like "Damn, she the one"

One, one, one (The one)
Bad bitch in the mirror like "Yeah, I'm in love"

We always get extra fries
And you know the sex is fire
And I gotta testify
I get flowers every Sunday
I'ma marry me one day

[Pre-Chorus 2]
True love ain't something you can buy yourself
True love finally happens when you by yourself
So if you by yourself, then go and buy yourself
Another round from the bottle on the higher shelf

[Chorus]
'Cause I'm my own soulmate (Yeah, yeah)
I know how to love me (Love me)
I know that I'm always gonna hold me down
(Always gonna hold me down)
Yeah, I'm my own soulmate (Yeah, yeah)
No, I'm never lonely (Lonely)
(No, I'm never lonely, no)
I know I'm a queen, but I don't need no crown

[Chorus]
Jerome, Jerome
Take your ass home
And come back when you're grown
Jerome, Jerome
Go on, take your ass home
Where the peaches have thorns, ooh

[Verse 1]
Poor little baby
Who told you that you stood a chance with this royalty?
You're so sweet, bless your heart
Can't let a pretty face distract me from business
And God as my witness, your ugly ass won't either
I'm sorry, 2 AM photos with smileys and hearts
Ain't the way to my juicy parts
Boy, thank me later, looks good on paper
But love isn't easy, so I'll do the hardest part

[Chorus]
Jerome, Jerome
Go on, take your ass home
And come back when you're grown
Jerome, ooh, Jerome
Go on, take your ass home
Where the peaches have thorns

[Verse 2]
I never said I was perfect
Or you don't deserve a good person to carry your baggage
I know a few girls that can handle it
I ain't that kind of chick, but I can call 'em for you if you want
I never said that you wasn't attractive
Your style and that beard, ooh, don't get me distracted
I'm tryna be patient, and patience takes practice
The fact is I'm leaving, so just let me have this

[Chorus]
Jerome, Jerome
Take your ass home
And come back when you're grown, oh
Jerome, ooh, Jerome
Go on, take your ass home
Where the peaches have thorns

[Outro]
Hee, hee, hee, hee, hee

Thank God, thank God, thank God, I'm gettin' thicker

I don't see nobody else
'Scuse me while I feel myself
'Scuse me while I feel myself
I don't see nobody else
'Scuse me while I feel myself

[Verse 2: Sophia Eris]
Outside of the club
And I'm drip-drip-dripping sugar sweet
Cinnamon on skin with the hooligans
Y'all came to rock, and we came to ah!
Put a sting in her lips, [?] for the eye
Go on, take a sip, got milk in her thighs
[?] on sunny day from green tube and my high prices for the
Dream-dream, not cause i mean it means a thing to take from me
Unless it's just some DMT that's all up in my energy
Yup yup, go on place that bet
If you wanna come test in the mama's nest
With a bullet vest and curious chest
Got the ammo on the brain but I hide the best
Hey, I'm pumped up call me dough cooking
Gooey salty soul tookin', batches in a row lookin'
Magic as all hell, we livin', never ever will we give in
To a wack beat fuck with Lazerbeak in these mad streets
Get it, go there and we give it, haters will forbid it
They fall into the minutes because of imagination
Now the ones who in the nation, we the ones who need escapin'
Then we find some new ovens and we made it

[Verse 3: Lizzo]
Six-pence and land on the richer
Cut a niggah up and hung him like Jack the Ripper
Undo your zipper, get on your knees
And get ready for the industry in a nutshell (get it?)
Them goods don't get got if it's the only thing you got
Better keep them in that hot black pot
The only thing colder than the local talent, are the winters
Thrift store shopping, look like Anna Wintour
You ain't gotta ask about it cause I been hurr
Ridin' in them chariots like we in Ben Hur
Yah sure, ya know, yah sure, ya know, yah sure, ya know...
Rappin' and rappin' and I been steadily stackin'
I put these niggas in napkins and tuck 'em down for a nap
And apologies to the Capitol because I don't pay my capital
And if you happen to hear this then just pretend that you didn't at all, stall

[Hook]
I got my batches and cookies, I got my batches and cookies
I got my batches and cookies, I got my batches and cookies
Got my batches and cookies, I got my batches and cookies

Got my batches and cookies, I got my batches and cookies

Ooh, goo, cookies, cream
Ooh, goo, cookies, cream

Hey, you should too

[Chorus: Caroline Smith]
So let ‘em say what they gonna say
They gonna feel how they gonna feel
But I love it
I love it, baby
Hey, you should too

[Verse 1: Lizzo]
I’m just as thick as my skin is
I feel the water rolling down my back
Precipitation’s so repetitive
I read this all before
Interrogation to my hometown
Your comments leave me such a nasty taste
Can’t feel the sound
Swish all around
A palate-cleanser for your salty mouth

[Pre-Chorus]
I know they’ll never get enough
They don’t get it, they don’t get it
But if you’re giving in then don’t you change
Cause living well's the best revenge

[Chorus]
So let ‘em say what they gonna say
They gonna feel how they gonna feel
But I love it
I love it, baby
Hey, you should too

Don’t pay them no mind

[Verse 2: Caroline Smith]
I’m not as thick as my skin is
Trying to stay strong
Stay tuned out at the top but
When you’re running the business
I wish it was easy
Trying to work like a boss but
They keep shaking my patience
Don’t wanna think like a man
Or look like a model
I wanna look like my momma
Five foot two and a natural woman

[Pre-Chorus]
I know they’ll never get enough
They don’t get it, they don’t get it
But if you’re giving in then don’t you change
Cause living was the best revenge

[Chorus]
So let ‘em say what they gonna say
They gonna feel how they gonna feel
But I love it
I love it, baby
Hey, you should too

[Refrain]
They know what is what
But they don't know what is what
They just strut
What the fuck?

[Verse 1: Katy Perry]
A tiger
Don't lose no sleep
Don't need opinions
From a shellfish or a sheep
Don't you come for me
No, not today
You're calculated
I got your number
'Cause you're a joker
And I'm a courtside killer queen
And you will kiss the ring
You best believe

[Pre-Chorus: Katy Perry]
So keep calm, honey, I'ma stick around

You're 'bout cute as
An old coupon expired
And karma's not a liar
She keeps receipts

[Pre-Chorus: Katy Perry]
So keep calm, honey, I'ma stick around
For more than a minute, get used to it
Funny my name keeps comin' outcho mouth
'Cause I stay winning
Lay 'em up like

[Verse 3: Nicki Minaj]
Pink Ferragamo sliders on deck
Silly rap beefs just get me more checks
My life is a movie, I'm never off set
Me and my amigos (no, not Offset)
Swish swish, aww I got them upset
But my shooters'll make 'em dance like dubstep
Swish, swish, aww, my haters is obsessed
'Cause I make M's, they get much less
Don't be tryna double back
I already despise you
All that fake love you showin'
Couldn't even disguise you
Ran? When? Nicki gettin' tan
Mirror mirror who's the fairest bitch in all the land?
Damn, man, this bitch is a Stan
Muah, muah, the generous queen will kiss a fan
Ass goodbye, I'ma be riding by
I'ma tell my ----- Biggz, yeah that's tha guy
A star's a star, da ha da ha
They never thought the swish god would take it this far
Get my pimp cup, this is pimp shit, baby
I only rock with Queens, so I'm makin' hits with Katy

[Chorus: Katy Perry]
Swish, swish, bish
Another one in the basket
Can't touch this
Another one in the casket

[Verse 1: Katy Perry]
Are we crazy?
Living our lives through a lens
Trapped in our white picket fence
Like ornaments
So comfortable, we're living in a bubble, bubble
So comfortable, we cannot see the trouble, trouble
Aren't you lonely
Up there in utopia
Where nothing will ever be enough?
Happily numb
So comfortable, we're living in a bubble, bubble
So comfortable, we cannot see the trouble, trouble

[Pre-Chorus: Katy Perry]
So put your rose-colored glasses on
And party on

[Chorus: Katy Perry]
Turn it up, it's your favorite song
Dance, dance, dance to the distortion
Come on, turn it up, keep it on repeat
Stumbling around like a wasted zombie
Yeah, we think we're free
Drink, this one is on me
We're all chained to the rhythm
To the rhythm
To the rhythm
Turn it up, it's your favorite song
Dance, dance, dance to the distortion
Come on, turn it up, keep it on repeat
Stumbling around like a wasted zombie
Yeah, we think we're free
Drink, this one is on me
We're all chained to the rhythm
To the rhythm
To the rhythm

[Verse 2: Katy Perry]
Are we tone deaf?
Keep sweeping it under the mat
Thought we could do better than that
I hope we can
So comfortable, we're living in a bubble, bubble
So comfortable, we cannot see the trouble, trouble

[Pre-Chorus: Katy Perry]
So put your rose-colored glasses on
And party on

[Chorus: Katy Perry]
Turn it up, it's your favorite song

[Bridge: Skip Marley]
It is my desire
Break down the walls to connect, inspire
Ay, up in your high place, liars
Time is ticking for the empire
The truth they feed is feeble
As so many times before
They greed over the people
They stumbling and fumbling
And we're about to riot
They woke up, they woke up the lions
(Woo!)

[Chorus: Katy Perry]
Turn it up, it's your favorite song
Dance, dance, dance to the distortion
Come on, turn it up, keep it on repeat
Stumbling around like a wasted zombie
Yeah, we think we're free
Drink, this one is on me
We're all chained to the rhythm
To the rhythm
To the rhythm

[Outro: Katy Perry]
Turn it up
Turn it up
It goes on, and on, and on
It goes on, and on, and on
It goes on, and on, and on
'Cause we're all chained to the rhythm

[Intro: Juicy J]
Yeah, ya'll know what it is
Katy Perry, Juicy J
Uh-huh, let's rage!

[Verse 1: Katy Perry]
I knew you were, you were gonna come to me
And here you are, but you better choose carefully
'Cause I, I'm capable of anything
Of anything, and everything
Make me your Aphrodite
Make me your one and only
But don't make me your enemy (Enemy)
Your enemy (Your enemy), your enemy

[Chorus: Katy Perry]
So you wanna play with magic?
Boy, you should know what you're fallin' for
Baby, do you dare to do this?
'Cause I'm coming at you like a dark horse
Are you ready for, ready for
A perfect storm, perfect storm?
'Cause once you're mine, once you're mine
There's no going back

[Verse 2: Katy Perry]
Mark my words, this love will make you levitate
Like a bird, like a bird without a cage
We're down to earth if you choose to walk away
Don't walk away (Walk away)
It's in the palm of your hand now, baby
It's a yes or a no, no maybe
So just be sure before you give it all to me
All to me, give it all to me

[Chorus: Katy Perry]
So you wanna play with magic?
Boy, you should know what you're fallin' for
Baby, do you dare to do this?
'Cause I'm coming at you like a dark horse
Are you ready for, ready for
A perfect storm, perfect storm?
'Cause once you're mine, once you're mine
There's no going back

[Verse 3: Juicy J]
She's a beast, I call her Karma (Come back)
She eat your heart out like Jeffrey Dahmer (Woo!)
Be careful, try not to lead her on
Shawty's heart is on steroids, 'cause her love is so strong
You may fall in love when you meet her (Meet her)
If you get the chance, you better keep her (Keep her)
She's sweet as pie, but if you break her heart
She turn cold as a freezer (Freezer)
That fairy tale ending with a knight in shining armor
She can be my sleeping beauty, I'm gon' put her in a coma (Woo!)
Damn, I think I love her, shawty's so bad, I'm sprung and I don't care
She ride me like a roller coaster, turn the bedroom into a fair (A fair)
Her love is like a drug, I was tryna hit it and quit it
But lil mama so dope, I messed around and got addicted

[Chorus: Katy Perry]
So you wanna play with magic?
Boy, you should know what you're fallin' for (You should know)
Baby, do you dare to do this?
'Cause I'm coming at you like a dark horse (Like a dark horse)
Are you ready for, ready for (Ready for)
A perfect storm, perfect storm? (A perfect storm)
'Cause once you're mine, once you're mine
There's no going back

Every single night

[Verse 4: Takeoff]
I'm the one they say can change your life (Takeoff)
No waterfall, she drippin' wet, you like my ice? (Blast)
She say she want a Migo night
Now I ask her, "What's the price?" (Hold on)
If she do right, told her get whatever you like

[Verse 5: Offset]
Offset
I grab her legs and now divide, aight
Make her do a donut when she ride, aight
Looking at the eyes of a dime, make you blind
In her spine and my diamonds change the climate

[Verse 6: Quavo & Katy Perry]
Sweet tooth, no tooth fairy
Whipped cream, no dairy
Got her hot light on, screaming, "I'm ready"
But no horses, no carriage

All that you can have, boy (Oh)

Bon appétit

[Outro: Quavo & Katy Perry]
Under candlelight (Yeah, woo)
Bon appétit, baby

[Verse 1]
I used to bite my tongue and hold my breath
Scared to rock the boat and make a mess
So I sat quietly, agreed politely
I guess that I forgot I had a choice
I let you push me past the breaking point
I stood for nothing, so I fell for everything

[Pre-Chorus]
You held me down, but I got up (Hey)
Already brushing off the dust
You hear my voice, your hear that sound
Like thunder, gonna shake the ground
You held me down, but I got up (Hey)
Get ready cause I had enough
I see it all, I see it now

[Chorus]
I got the eye of the tiger, a fighter
Dancing through the fire
'Cause I am a champion, and you’re gonna hear me roar
Louder, louder than a lion
'Cause I am a champion, and you’re gonna hear me roar

[Post-Chorus]
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
You’re gonna hear me roar

[Verse 2]
Now I’m floating like a butterfly
Stinging like a bee I earned my stripes
I went from zero, to my own hero

[Pre-Chorus]
You held me down, but I got up (Hey)
Already brushing off the dust
You hear my voice, you hear that sound
Like thunder, gonna shake the ground
You held me down, but I got up (Got up)
Get ready 'cause I had enough
I see it all, I see it now

[Chorus]
I got the eye of the tiger, a fighter
Dancing through the fire
'Cause I am a champion, and you’re gonna hear me roar
Louder, louder than a lion
'Cause I am a champion, and you’re gonna hear me roar

[Post-Chorus]
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
You’re gonna hear me roar
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh

Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
You’re gonna hear me roar

[Bridge]
Roar, roar, roar, roar, roar

[Chorus]

[Verse 1]
I'm losing my self control
Yeah, you’re starting to trickle back in
But I don't wanna fall down the rabbit hole
Cross my heart, I won't do it again

[Pre-Chorus]
I tell myself, tell myself, tell myself, "Draw the line"
And I do, I do
But once in a while, I trip up, and I cross the line
And I think of you

[Chorus]
Two years, and just like that
My head still takes me back
Thought it was done, but I
Guess it’s never really over
Oh, we were such a mess
But wasn't it the best?
Thought it was done, but I
Guess it's never really over

[Post-Chorus]
Just because it's over doesn't mean it's really over
And if I think it over, maybe you'll be coming over again
And I'll have to get over you all over again
Just because it’s over doesn’t mean it's really over
And if I think it over, maybe you’ll be coming over again
And I'll have to get over you all over again

[Verse 2]
I guess I could try hypnotherapy
I gotta rewire this brain
'Cause I can't even go on the internet
Without even checking your name

[Pre-Chorus]
I tell myself, tell myself, tell myself, "Draw the line"
And I do, I do
But once in a while, I trip up, and I cross the line
I think of you

[Chorus]
Two years, and just like that
My head still takes me back
Thought it was done, but I
Guess it’s never really over
Oh, we were such a mess
But wasn't it the best?
Thought it was done, but I
Guess it's never really over

[Post-Chorus]
Just because it's over doesn't mean it's really over
And if I think it over, maybe you'll be coming over again
And I'll have to get over you all over again
Just because it's over doesn't mean it's really over
And if I think it over, maybe you'll be coming over again
And I'll have to get over you all over again

[Bridge]
Thought we kissed goodbye
Thought we meant this time was the last
But I guess it's never really over
Thought we drew the line right through you and I
Can't keep going back
I guess it's never really over, yeah

[Chorus]
Two years, and just like that
My head still takes me back
Thought it was done, but I
Guess it's never really over

[Post-Chorus]
Just because it's over doesn't mean it's really over
And if I think it over, maybe you'll be coming over again
And I'll have to get over you all over again
(And I'll have to get over you all over again)
Just because it's over doesn't mean it's really over
And if I think it over, maybe you'll be coming over again
And I'll have to get over you all over again
(Over you all over again)

[Outro]
Thought we kissed goodbye
Thought we meant this time was the last
But I guess it's never really over
Thought we drew the line right through you and I
Can't keep going back
I guess it's never really over

[Verse 1]
Do you ever feel like a plastic bag
Drifting through the wind, wanting to start again?
Do you ever feel, feel so paper-thin
Like a house of cards, one blow from caving in?
Do you ever feel already buried deep?
Six feet under screams, but no one seems to hear a thing
Do you know that there's still a chance for you?
'Cause there's a spark in you

[Pre-Chorus]
You just gotta ignite the light
And let it shine
Just own the night
Like the Fourth of July

[Chorus]
'Cause baby, you're a firework
Come on show 'em what you're worth
Make 'em go, "Aah, aah, aah"
As you shoot across the sky
Baby, you're a firework
Come on, let your colors burst
Make 'em go, "Aah, aah, aah"
You're gonna leave them all in awe, awe, awe

[Verse 2]
You don't have to feel like a waste of space
You're original, cannot be replaced
If you only knew what the future holds
After a hurricane comes a rainbow
Maybe a reason why all the doors are closed
So you could open one that leads you to the perfect road
Like a lightning bolt, your heart will glow
And when it's time, you'll know

[Pre-Chorus]
You just gotta ignite the light
And let it shine
Just own the night
Like the Fourth of July

[Chorus]
'Cause baby, you're a firework
Come on, show 'em what you're worth
Make 'em go, "Aah, aah, aah"
As you shoot across the sky
Baby, you're a firework
Come on, let your colors burst
Make 'em go, "Aah, aah, aah"
You're gonna leave them all in awe, awe, awe

[Bridge]
Boom, boom, boom
Even brighter than the moon, moon, moon
It's always been inside of you, you, you
And now it's time to let it through

[Chorus]
'Cause baby, you're a firework
Come on, show 'em what you're worth
Make 'em go, "Aah, aah, aah"
As you shoot across the sky
Baby, you're a firework
Come on, let your colors burst
Make 'em go, "Aah, aah, aah"
You're gonna leave them all in awe, awe, awe

[Outro]
Boom, boom, boom
Even brighter than the moon, moon, moon
Boom, boom, boom
Even brighter than the moon, moon, moon

[Verse 1]
Summer after high school, when we first met
We'd make out in your Mustang to Radiohead
And on my 18th birthday, we got matching tattoos
Used to steal your parents' liquor and climb to the roof
Talk about our future like we had a clue
Never planned that one day I'd be losing you

[Chorus]
In another life, I would be your girl
We'd keep all our promises, be us against the world
In another life, I would make you stay
So I don't have to say you were the one that got away
The one that got away

[Verse 2]
I was June, and you were my Johnny Cash
Never one without the other, we made a pact
Sometimes when I miss you, I put those records on, whoa
Someone said you had your tattoo removed
Saw you downtown, singing the blues
It's time to face the music, I'm no longer your muse

[Chorus]
But in another life, I would be your girl
We'd keep all our promises, be us against the world
In another life, I would make you stay
So I don't have to say you were the one that got away
The one that got away

[Post-Chorus]
The one
The one
The one
The one that got away

[Bridge]
All this money can't buy me a time machine, no
Can't replace you with a million rings, no
I should've told you what you meant to me, whoa
'Cause now I pay the price

[Chorus]
In another life, I would be your girl
We'd keep all our promises, be us against the world
In another life, I would make you stay
So I don't have to say you were the one that got away
The one that got away

[Post-Chorus]
The one (The one)
The one (The one)
The one (The one)
In another life, I would make you stay
So I don't have to say you were the one that got away
The one that got away

[Verse 1]
I won't just survive
Oh, you will see me thrive
Can write my story
I'm beyond the archetype
I won't just conform
No matter how you shake my core
’Cause my roots, they run deep, oh

[Pre-Chorus 1]
(Oh, ye of so little faith)
Don't doubt it, don't doubt it
(Victory is in my veins)
I know it, I know it
(And I will not negotiate)
I'll fight it, I'll fight it
I will transform

[Chorus]
When, when the fire's at my feet again
And the vultures all start circling
They're whispering, ”You're out of time.”
But still, I rise
This is no mistake, no accident
When you think the final nail is in; think again
Don't be surprised, I will still rise

[Verse 2]
I must stay conscious
Through the madness and chaos
So I call on my angels
They say...

[Pre-Chorus 2]
(Oh, ye of so little faith)
Don't doubt it, don't doubt it
(Victory is in your veins)
You know it, you know it
And you will not negotiate
Just fight it, just fight it
And be transformed

[Chorus]
’Cause when, when the fire's at my feet again
And the vultures all start circling
They're whispering, “You're out of time.”
But still, I rise
This is no mistake, no accident
When you think the final nail is in; think again
Don't be surprised, I will still rise

[Outro]
(Don't doubt it, don't doubt it)
Oh, oh, oh, oh
(You know it, you know it)
Still rise
(Just fight it, just fight it)
Don't be surprised, I will still rise

[Intro: Snoop Dogg]
Greetings, loved ones
Let's take a journey

[Verse 1: Katy Perry]
I know a place where the grass is really greener
Warm, wet and wild
There must be something in the water
Sipping gin and juice
Laying underneath the palm trees (Undone)
The boys break their necks
Trying to creep a little sneak peek (At us)

[Pre-Chorus: Katy Perry]
You could travel the world
But nothing comes close to the golden coast
Once you party with us
You'll be falling in love
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

[Chorus: Katy Perry]
California girls, we're unforgettable
Daisy Dukes, bikinis on top
Sun-kissed skin so hot, we'll melt your popsicle
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
California girls, we're undeniable
Fine, fresh, fierce, we got it on lock
West Coast represent, now put your hands up
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

[Verse 2: Katy Perry]
Sex (Sex) on the beach
We don't mind sand in our stilettos
We freak in my Jeep ​*horn honks*​
Snoop Doggy Dogg on the stereo, oh-oh

[Pre-Chorus: Katy Perry]
You could travel the world (You could travel the world)
But nothing comes close to the golden coast
Once you party with us (Once you party with us)
You'll be falling in love
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

[Chorus: Katy Perry & (Snoop Dogg)]
California gurls, we're unforgettable (California)
Daisy Dukes, bikinis on top
Sun-kissed skin so hot, we'll melt your popsicle
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
California gurls (California), we're undeniable
Fine, fresh, fierce, we got it on lock
West Coast represent (West Coast), now put your hands up
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

[Verse 3: Snoop Dogg & Katy Perry, Both]
Toned, tan, fit and ready
Turn it up cause it's getting heavy
Wild, wild, West Coast
These are the girls I love the most
I mean the ones, I mean like she's the one
Kiss her, touch her, squeeze her buns (Uh!)
The girl's a freak
She drive a Jeep and live on the beach
I'm okay, I won't play
I love the Bay just like I love L.A
Venice Beach and Palm Springs
Summertime is everything
Homeboys banging out
All that ass hanging out
Bikinis, zucchinis, martinis, no weenies
Just the king and a queenie
Katy, my lady (Yeah?)
Lookie here, baby (Uh-huh)
I'm all up on ya
'Cause you representing California (Oh-oh, yeah)

[Chorus: Katy Perry & (Snoop Dogg)]
California gurls, we're unforgettable
Daisy Dukes, bikinis on top
Sun-kissed skin so hot, we'll melt your popsicle
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh (Come on, come on)
California gurls, we're undeniable
Fine, fresh, fierce, we got it on lock
West Coast represent (West Coast, West Coast)
Now put your hands up (Aye, aye)
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

[Outro: Snoop Dogg & (Katy Perry)]
(California, California gurls)
California gurls, man
(California) Hahahaha
(California Gurls)
I really wish you all could be California gurls

[Verse 1]
This was never the way I planned
Not my intention
I got so brave, drink in hand
Lost my discretion
It's not what I'm used to
Just wanna try you on
I'm curious for you
Caught my attention

[Chorus]
I kissed a girl and I liked it
The taste of her cherry chapstick
I kissed a girl just to try it
I hope my boyfriend don't mind it
It felt so wrong, it felt so right
Don't mean I'm in love tonight
I kissed a girl and I liked it
I liked it

[Verse 2]
No, I don't even know your name
It doesn't matter
You're my experimental game
Just human nature
It's not what good girls do
Not how they should behave
My head gets so confused
Hard to obey

[Chorus]
I kissed a girl and I liked it
The taste of her cherry chapstick
I kissed a girl just to try it
I hope my boyfriend don't mind it
It felt so wrong, it felt so right
Don't mean I'm in love tonight
I kissed a girl and I liked it
I liked it

[Bridge]
Us girls, we are so magical
Soft skin, red lips, so kissable
Hard to resist, so touchable
Too good to deny it
Ain't no big deal, it's innocent

[Chorus]
I kissed a girl and I liked it
The taste of her cherry chapstick
I kissed a girl just to try it
I hope my boyfriend don't mind it
It felt so wrong, it felt so right
Don't mean I'm in love tonight
I kissed a girl and I liked it
I liked it

[Verse 1]
If I lost it all today, would you stay?
Could my love be enough to stimulate?
If shit hit the fan, grenades got thrown
Would you still show, oh?
Could you go down with me to the mat?
Could we get back up and eventually laugh?
Roll eyes at highs, cheers in the lows, and stay in the flow, whoa

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause I, I only got this life
And I ain't got the time, no
Not to get it right, oh

[Chorus]
We're all just looking for connection
Yeah, we all want to be seen
I'm looking for someone who speaks my language
Someone to ride this ride with me
Can I get a witness? (Witness)
Will you be my witness? (Witness)
I'm just looking for a witness in all of this
Looking for a witness to get me through this

[Verse 2]
When you tell me everything, and there's no holes
You can scroll through anything, you've got the codes
Nothing to hide, it's all in their eyes
And we just know, whoa

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause I, I only got this life
And I ain't got the time, no
Not to get it right, oh

[Chorus]
We're all just looking for connection
Yeah, we all want to be seen
I'm looking for someone who speaks my language
Someone to ride this ride with me
Can I get a witness? (Witness)
Will you be my witness? (Witness)
I'm just looking for a witness (yeah) in all of this (Oh)
Looking for a witness to get me through this
(Through this, through this, through this, through this)
(Through this, through this, through this, through this)

[Bridge]
Will you be my witness?
Could you be the one that speaks for me?
Will you be my witness?

[Chorus]
We're all just looking for connection (We're all just looking)
Yeah, we all want to be seen
I'm looking for someone who speaks my language
Someone (To ride this ride) to ride this ride with me (With me)
Can I get a witness? (Witness)
Will you be my witness? (Witness)
(Will you be my witness?)
I'm just looking for a witness in all of this
Looking for a witness to get me through this

[Outro]
Oh-oh-oh-oh (Ah)
Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, ooh-ooh
Hey (Ah)
Oh-oh-oh
Hey

[Verse 1]
You think I'm pretty without any makeup on
You think I'm funny when I tell the punch line wrong
I know you get me
So I let my walls come down, down
Before you met me
I was alright, but things were kinda heavy
You brought me to life
Now every February, you'll be my Valentine, Valentine

[Pre-Chorus]
Let's go all the way tonight
No regrets, just love
We can dance until we die
You and I, we'll be young forever

[Chorus]
You make me feel like I'm living a teenage dream
The way you turn me on
I can't sleep
Let's run away and don't ever look back
Don't ever look back
My heart stops when you look at me
Just one touch
Now baby, I believe this is real
So take a chance and don't ever look back
Don't ever look back

[Verse 2]
We drove to Cali and got drunk on the beach
Got a motel and built a fort out of sheets
I finally found you, my missing puzzle piece
I'm complete

[Pre-Chorus]
Let's go all the way tonight
No regrets, just love
We can dance until we die
You and I, we'll be young forever

[Chorus]
You make me feel like I'm living a teenage dream
The way you turn me on
I can't sleep
Let's run away and don't ever look back
Don't ever look back
My heart stops when you look at me
Just one touch
Now baby, I believe this is real
So take a chance and don't ever look back
Don't ever look back

[Bridge]
I'mma get your heart racing in my skin-tight jeans
Be your teenage dream tonight
Let you put your hands on me in my skin-tight jeans
Be your teenage dream tonight
(Tonight, tonight, tonight...)

[Chorus]
(You make me)
You make me feel like I'm living a teenage dream
The way you turn me on
I can't sleep
Let's run away and don't ever look back
Don't ever look back (No)
My heart stops when you look at me
Just one touch
Now baby, I believe this is real (Oh, oh)
So take a chance and don't ever look back
Don't ever look back

[Outro]
I'mma get your heart racing in my skin-tight jeans
Be your teenage dream tonight
Let you put your hands on me in my skin-tight jeans
Be your teenage dream tonight
(Tonight, tonight, tonight...)

[Verse 1]
You love the hell out of me
And Heaven's where we could be
I've stood on the edge of love
But never took the leap
And you took my armor off
And did it delicately
And I let my guard down
To show you what's underneath

[Pre-Chorus]
Thank God that you were man enough to come
Answer my mama's prayers
You asked the question, I said, "Yes"
But I'm scared

[Chorus]
'Cause I've never worn white
But I wanna get it right
Yeah, I really wanna try with you
No, I've never worn white
But I'm standin' here tonight
'Cause I really wanna say "I do"
I do

[Verse 2]
See us in sixty years with a full family tree (I do)
Give my blood, sweat, and tears to reach our destiny (I do)
'Cause love is a minefield, let's take this war, baby (I do)
'Cause at the end of it all, I choose you and you choose me (I do)

[Pre-Chorus]
Thank God I was woman enough to come
Answer your father's prayers
You asked the question
I could tell you were scared

[Chorus]
'Cause I've never worn white
But I wanna get it right
Yeah, I really wanna try with you
No, I've never worn white
But I'm standin' here tonight
'Cause I really wanna say "I do"

[Bridge]
Now let's dance with each other (Dance with each other)
Mixing all of our colors
It's so easy to surrender
When you finally find forever

[Chorus]
No, I've never worn white, no
But I really wanna try with you
Yeah, I've never worn white
But I wanna get it right
'Cause I really wanna say "I do"

[Outro]
'Cause I do
Oh, I do, yeah, yeah
I do

[Verse 1]
You change your mind like a girl changes clothes
Yeah, you PMS like a bitch; I would know
And you overthink, always speak cryptically
I should know that you're no good for me

[Chorus]
'Cause you're hot then you're cold
You're yes, then you're no
You're in, then you're out
You're up, then you're down
You're wrong when it's right
It's black and it's white
We fight, we break up
We kiss, we make up
(You) You don't really wanna stay, no
(You) But you don't really wanna go, oh
You're hot then you're cold
You're yes, then you're no
You're in, then you're out
You're up, then you're down

[Verse 2]
We used to be just like twins, so in sync
The same energy, now's a dead battery
Used to laugh (Used to laugh) 'bout nothing ('Bout nothing)
Now you're plain (Now you're plain) boring (Boring)
I should know (I should know) that you're not gonna change

[Chorus]
'Cause you're hot then you're cold
You're yes, then you're no
You're in, then you're out
You're up, then you're down
You're wrong when it's right
It's black and it's white
We fight, we break up
We kiss, we make up
(You) You don't really wanna stay, no
(You) But you don't really wanna go, oh
You're hot then you're cold
You're yes, then you're no
You're in, then you're out
You're up, then you're down

[Bridge]
Someone call the doctor
Got a case of a love bipolar
Stuck on a roller coaster
Can't get off this ride
You change your mind like a girl changes clothes

[Chorus]
'Cause you're hot then you're cold
You're yes, then you're no
You're in, then you're out
You're up, then you're down
You're wrong when it's right
It's black and it's white
We fight, we break up
We kiss, we make up
You're hot then you're cold
You're yes, then you're no
You're in, then you're out
You're up, then you're down
You're wrong when it's right
It's black and it's white
We fight, we break up
We kiss, we make up
(You) You don't really wanna stay, no
(You) But you don't really wanna go, oh
You're hot then you're cold
You're yes, then you're no
You're in, then you're out
You're up, then you're down

[Verse 1]
I heard you're feeling nothing's going right
Why don't you let me stop by?
The clock is ticking, running out of time
So we should party all night

[Pre-Chorus 1]
So cover your eyes, I have a surprise
I hope you got a healthy appetite
If you wanna dance, if you want it all
You know that I'm the girl that you should call

[Chorus]
Boy, when you're with me, I'll give you a taste
Make it like your birthday every day
I know you like it sweet, so you can have your cake
Give you something good to celebrate

[Post-Chorus]
So make a wish
I'll make it like your birthday every day
I'll be your gift
Give you something good to celebrate

[Verse 2]
Pop your confetti, pop your Pérignon
So hot and heavy 'til dawn
I got you spinning like a disco ball
All night they're playing your song

[Pre-Chorus 2]
We're living the life, we're doing it right (Right)
You're never gonna be unsatisfied
If you wanna dance, if you want it all (All)
You know that I'm the girl that you should call (Yeah)

[Chorus]
Boy, when you're with me, I'll give you a taste
Make it like your birthday every day
I know you like it sweet, so you can have your cake
Give you something good to celebrate

[Post-Chorus]
So make a wish
I'll make it like your birthday every day
I'll be (I'll be) your gift (Your gift)
Give you something good to celebrate

[Bridge]
Happy birthday
So let me get you in your birthday suit
It's time to bring out the big balloons (Woo)
So let me get you in your birthday suit
It's time to bring out the big, big, big, big, big, big balloons

[Chorus]
Boy, when you're with me, I'll give you a taste (Oh baby)
I'll make it like your birthday every day
I know you like it sweet, so you can have your cake
Give you something good to celebrate (Celebrate now)
Boy, when you're with me, I'll give you a taste (Celebrate now)
Make it like your birthday every day (Woo)
I know you like it sweet, so you can have your cake
Give you something good to celebrate

[Post-Chorus]
So make a wish
I'll make it like your birthday every day
I'll be your gift
Give you something good to celebrate

[Outro]
Happy birthday

[Verse 1]
There's a stranger in my bed
There's a pounding in my head
Glitter all over the room
Pink flamingos in the pool
I smell like a minibar
DJ's passed out in the yard
Barbies on the barbeque
This a hickey or a bruise?

[Pre-Chorus]
Pictures of last night ended up online
I'm screwed, oh well
It's a blacked out blur, but I'm pretty sure it ruled
Damn

[Chorus]
Last Friday night
Yeah, we danced on tabletops
And we took too many shots
Think we kissed, but I forgot
Last Friday night
Yeah, we maxed our credit cards
And got kicked out of the bar, so we hit the boulevard
Last Friday night
We went streaking in the park
Skinny dipping in the dark, then had a ménage à trois
Last Friday night
Yeah, I think we broke the law
Always say we're gonna stop-op, oh whoa

[Post-Chorus]
But this Friday night, do it all again
But this Friday night, do it all again

[Verse 2]
Trying to connect the dots
Don't know what to tell my boss
Think the city towed my car
Chandelier is on the floor
Ripped my favorite party dress
Warrant's out for my arrest
Think I need a ginger ale
That was such an epic fail

[Pre-Chorus]
Pictures of last night ended up online
I'm screwed, oh well
It's a blacked out blur, but I'm pretty sure it ruled
Damn

[Chorus]
Last Friday night
Yeah, we danced on tabletops
And we took too many shots
Think we kissed, but I forgot
Last Friday night
Yeah, we maxed our credit cards
And got kicked out of the bar, so we hit the boulevard
Last Friday night
We went streaking in the park
Skinny dipping in the dark, then had a ménage à trois
Last Friday night
Yeah, I think we broke the law
Always say we're gonna stop-op, oh whoa

[Post-Chorus]
But this Friday night, do it all again (Do it all again)
This Friday night, do it all again
(Do it all again) This Friday night

[Bridge]
T.G.I.F., T.G.I.F., T.G.I.F
T.G.I.F., T.G.I.F., T.G.I.F

[Saxophone Solo]

[Chorus]
Last Friday night
Yeah, we danced on tabletops
And we took too many shots
Think we kissed, but I forgot
Last Friday night
Yeah, we maxed our credit cards
And got kicked out of the bar, so we hit the boulevard
Last Friday night
We went streaking in the park
Skinny dipping in the dark, then had a ménage à trois
Last Friday night
Yeah, I think we broke the law
Always say we're gonna stop-op, oh whoa

[Post-Chorus]
But this Friday night, do it all again

[Produced by Dr. Luke and Max Martin]

[Verse 1]
Oh no, did I get too close?
Oh, did I almost see what's really on the inside?
All your insecurities
All the dirty laundry
Never made me blink one time

[Chorus]
Unconditional, unconditionally
I will love you unconditionally
There is no fear now
Let go and just be free
I will love you unconditionally

[Verse 2]
So come just as you are to me
Don't need apologies
Know that you are worthy
I'll take your bad days with your good
Walk through the storm, I would
I'd do it all because I love you
I love you

[Chorus]
Unconditional, unconditionally
I will love you unconditionally
There is no fear now
Let go and just be free
I will love you unconditionally

[Verse 3]
So open up your heart and just let it begin
Open up your heart and just let it begin
Open up your heart and just let it begin
Open up your heart

[Bridge]
Acceptance is the key to be
To be truly free
Will you do the same for me?

[Chorus]
Unconditional, unconditionally
I will love you unconditionally
And there is no fear now
Let go and just be free
'Cause I will love you unconditionally, oh yeah

[Outro]
I will love you (Unconditionally)
I will love you
I will love you unconditionally

[Verse 1]
Boy, tell me, can you take my breath away?
Cruisin' down a heart-shaped highway
Got you swervin' lane-to-lane, don't hit the brakes
'Cause I'm feelin' so safe

[Pre-Chorus]
I'll be your baby, on a Sunday
Oh, why don't we get out of town?
Call me your baby, on the same wave
Oh, no, no, there's no slowin' down

[Chorus]
You and I, I
Ridin' Harleys in Hawaii-i-i
I'm on the back, I'm holdin' tight, I
Want you to take me for a ride, ride
When I hula-hula, hula
So good, you'll take me to the jeweler-jeweler, jeweler
There's pink and purple in the sky-y-y
We're ridin' Harleys in Hawaii-i-i

[Verse 2]
Let me run my fingers through your salty hair
Go ahead, explore the island vibes
So real that you can feel it in the air
I'm revvin' up your engine

[Pre-Chorus]
I'll be your baby, on a Sunday
Oh, why don't we get out of town? (Why don't we get out of town?)
Call me your baby, catch the same wave
Oh, no, no, there's no slowin' down (Let's go)

[Chorus]
You and I, I
Ridin' Harleys in Hawaii-i-i
I'm on the back, I'm holdin' tight, I
Want you to take me for a ride, ride
When I hula-hula, hula
So good, you'll take me to the jeweler-jeweler, jeweler (Jeweler)
There's pink and purple in the sky-y-y
We're ridin' Harleys in Hawaii-i-i

[Bridge]
No, no

[Chorus]
You and I...
You and I, I
Ridin' Harleys in Hawaii-i-i
I'm on the back, I'm holdin' tight, I
Want you to take me for a ride, ride
When I hula-hula, hula
So good, you'll take me to the jeweler-jeweler, jeweler (Jeweler)
There's pink and purple in the sky-y-y
We're ridin' Harleys in Hawaii-i-i

[Outro]
I'll be your baby, on a Sunday
Oh...
We're ridin' Harleys in Hawaii-i
Call me your baby, catch the same wave
Oh...
We're ridin' Harleys in Hawaii-i

[Verse 1]
You're so hypnotizing
Could you be the devil?
Could you be an angel?
Your touch, magnetizing
Feels like I am floating
Leaves my body glowing
They say be afraid
You're not like the others
Futuristic lover
Different DNA
They don't understand you

[Pre-Chorus]
You're from a whole 'nother world
A different dimension
You open my eyes
And I'm ready to go, lead me into the light

[Chorus]
Kiss me, ki-ki-kiss me
Infect me with your lovin'
Fill me with your poison
Take me, ta-ta-take me
Wanna be your victim
Ready for abduction
Boy, you're an alien
Your touch, so foreign
It's supernatural
Extraterrestrial

[Verse 2]
You're so supersonic
Wanna feel your powers
Stun me with your lasers
Your kiss is cosmic
Every move is magic

[Pre-Chorus]
You're from a whole 'nother world
A different dimension
You open my eyes
And I'm ready to go, lead me into the light

[Chorus]
Kiss me, ki-ki-kiss me
Infect me with your lovin'
Fill me with your poison
Take me, ta-ta-take me
Wanna be your victim
Ready for abduction
Boy, you're an alien
Your touch, so foreign
It's supernatural
Extraterrestrial

[Bridge]
This is transcendental
On another level
Boy, you're my lucky star
I wanna walk on your wavelength
And be there when you vibrate
For you, I'll risk it all, all

[Chorus]
Kiss me, ki-ki-kiss me
Infect me with your lovin'
Fill me with your poison
Take me, ta-ta-take me
Wanna be your victim
Ready for abduction
Boy, you're an alien
Your touch, so foreign
It's supernatural
Extraterrestrial

[Outro]
Extraterrestrial
Extraterrestrial
Boy, you're an alien
Your touch, so foreign
It's supernatural
Extraterrestrial

[Verse 1]
First things first
I'ma say all the words inside my head
I'm fired up and tired of the way that things have been, oh-ooh
The way that things have been, oh-ooh
Second thing second
Don't you tell me what you think that I could be
I'm the one at the sail, I'm the master of my sea, oh-ooh
The master of my sea, oh-ooh

[Pre-Chorus]
I was broken from a young age
Taking my sulkin' to the masses
Writing my poems for the few
That look at me, took to me, shook at me, feelin' me
Singing from heartache from the pain
Taking my message from the veins
Speaking my lesson from the brain
Seeing the beauty through the...

[Chorus]
Pain! You made me a, you made me a believer, believer
Pain! You break me down and build me up, believer, believer
Pain! Oh, let the bullets fly, oh, let them rain
My life, my love, my drive, it came from...
Pain! You made me a, you made me a believer, believer

[Verse 2]
Third things third
Send a prayer to the ones up above
All the hate that you've heard has turned your spirit to a dove, oh-ooh
Your spirit up above, oh-ooh

[Pre-Chorus]
I was chokin' in the crowd
Building my rain up in the cloud
Falling like ashes to the ground
Hoping my feelings, they would drown
But they never did, ever lived, ebbin' and flowin'
Inhibited, limited 'til it broke open and rained down
It rained down, like...

[Chorus]
Pain! You made me a, you made me a believer, believer
Pain! You break me down and build me up, believer, believer
Pain! Oh, let the bullets fly, oh, let them rain
My life, my love, my drive, it came from...
Pain! You made me a, you made me a believer, believer

[Bridge]
Last things last
By the grace of the fire and the flames
You're the face of the future, the blood in my veins, oh-ooh
The blood in my veins, oh-ooh
But they never did, ever lived, ebbin' and flowin'
Inhibited, limited 'til it broke open and rained down
It rained down, like...

[Chorus]
Pain! You made me a, you made me a believer, believer
Pain! You break me down and build me up, believer, believer
Pain! Oh, let the bullets fly, oh, let them rain
My life, my love, my drive, it came from...
Pain! You made me a, you made me a believer, believer

[Verse 1]
Just a young gun with a quick fuse
I was uptight, wanna let loose
I was dreaming of bigger things
And wanna leave my own life behind
Not a "Yes, sir," not a follower
Fit the box, fit the mold
Have a seat in the foyer, take a number
I was lightning before the thunder

[Pre-Chorus]
Thunder, thunder
Thunder, thun-
Thunder, th-th-thunder, thunder
Thunder, thunder, thun-
Thunder, th-th-thunder, thunder

[Chorus]
Thunder, feel the thunder (Thunder, thunder, thun-)
Lightning then the thunder (Thunder, th-th-thunder, thunder)
Thunder, feel the thunder (Thunder, thunder, thun-, thun-)
Lightning then the thunder, thunder, thunder (Th-th-thunder)
Thunder (Thun-, thun-)

[Verse 2]
Kids were laughing in my classes
While I was scheming for the masses
Who do you think you are?
Dreaming 'bout being a big star
They say, "You're basic," they say, "You're easy"
You're always riding in the backseat
Now I'm smiling from the stage
While you were clapping in the nosebleeds

[Pre-Chorus]
Thunder, thunder
Thunder, thun-
Thunder, th-th-thunder, thunder
Thunder, thunder, thun-
Thunder, th-th-thunder, thunder

[Chorus]
Thunder, feel the thunder (Thunder, thunder, thun-)
Lightning then the thunder (Thunder, th-th-thunder, thunder)
Thunder, feel the thunder (Thunder, thunder, thun-, thun-)
Lightning then the thunder, thunder, thunder (Th-th-thunder)
Thunder (Thun-, thun-)

[Bridge]
Thunder, feel the thunder
Lightning then the thunder, thunder

[Chorus]
Thunder, feel the thunder (Thunder, thunder, thun-)
Lightning then the thunder, thunder (Thunder, th-th-thunder, thunder)
Thunder, feel the thunder (Thunder, thunder, thun-, thun-)
Lightning then the thunder, thunder (Th-th-thunder)
Thunder, feel the thunder (Thunder, thunder, thun-)
(Never give up, never give up)
Lightning then the thunder, thunder (Thunder, th-th-thunder, thunder)
(Never give up on your dreams)
Thunder, feel the thunder (Thunder, thunder, thun-, thun-)
(Never give up, never give up)
Lightning then the thunder, thunder (Th-th-thunder)
(Never give up on your dreams)

[Outro]
Thunder, thunder, thun-
Thunder, th-th-thunder, thunder
Thunder, thunder, thun-
Thunder, th-th-thunder, thunder
(Woah-oh-ohh)
Thunder, thunder, thun-
Thunder, th-th-thunder, thunder
(Woah-oh-ohh)
Thunder, thunder, thun-
Thunder, th-th-thunder, thunder

[Verse 1]
Falling too fast to prepare for this
Tripping in the world could be dangerous
Everybody circling is vulturous
Negative, nepotist
Everybody waiting for the fall of man
Everybody praying for the end of times
Everybody hoping they could be the one
I was born to run, I was born for this

[Pre-Chorus]
Whip, whip
Run me like a racehorse
Pull me like a ripcord
Break me down and build me up
I wanna be the slip, slip
Word upon your lip, lip
Letter that you rip, rip
Break me down and build me up

[Chorus]
Whatever it takes
'Cause I love the adrenaline in my veins
I do whatever it takes
'Cause I love how it feels when I break the chains
Whatever it takes
Yeah, take me to the top
I'm ready for whatever it takes
'Cause I love the adrenaline in my veins
I do what it takes

[Verse 2]
Always had a fear of being typical
Looking at my body feeling miserable
Always hanging on to the visual
I wanna be invisible
Looking at my years like a martyrdom
Everybody needs to be a part of 'em
Never be enough, I'm the prodigal son
I was born to run, I was born for this

[Pre-Chorus]
Whip, whip
Run me like a racehorse
Pull me like a ripcord
Break me down and build me up
I wanna be the slip, slip
Word upon your lip, lip
Letter that you rip, rip
Break me down and build me up

[Chorus]
Whatever it takes
'Cause I love the adrenaline in my veins
I do whatever it takes
'Cause I love how it feels when I break the chains
Whatever it takes
Yeah, take me to the top
I'm ready for whatever it takes
'Cause I love the adrenaline in my veins
I do what it takes

[Bridge]
Hypocritical, egotistical
Don't wanna be the parenthetical, hypothetical
Working hard on something that I'm proud of, out of the box
An epoxy to the world and the vision we've lost
I'm an apostrophe
I'm just a symbol to remind you that there's more to see
I'm just a product of the system, a catastrophe
And yet a masterpiece, and yet I'm half-diseased
And when I am deceased
At least I'll go down to the grave and die happily
And leave the body and the soul to be a part of thee
I do what it takes

[Chorus]
Whatever it takes
'Cause I love the adrenaline in my veins
I do whatever it takes
'Cause I love how it feels when I break the chains
Whatever it takes
Yeah, take me to the top
I'm ready for whatever it takes
'Cause I love the adrenaline in my veins
I do what it takes

[Verse 1]
When the days are cold and the cards all fold
And the saints we see are all made of gold
When your dreams all fail and the ones we hail
Are the worst of all, and the blood's run stale

[Pre-Chorus]
I wanna hide the truth, I wanna shelter you
But with the beast inside, there's nowhere we can hide
No matter what we breed, we still are made of greed
This is my kingdom come, this is my kingdom come

[Chorus]
When you feel my heat, look into my eyes
It's where my demons hide, it's where my demons hide
Don't get too close; it's dark inside
It's where my demons hide, it's where my demons hide

[Verse 2]
At the curtain's call it's the last of all
When the lights fade out, all the sinners crawl
So they dug your grave and the masquerade
Will come calling out at the mess you've made

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't wanna let you down, but I am hell-bound
Though this is all for you, don't wanna hide the truth
No matter what we breed, we still are made of greed
This is my kingdom come, this is my kingdom come

[Chorus]
When you feel my heat, look into my eyes
It's where my demons hide, it's where my demons hide
Don't get too close; it's dark inside
It's where my demons hide, it's where my demons hide

[Bridge]
They say it's what you make, I say it's up to fate
It's woven in my soul, I need to let you go
Your eyes, they shine so bright, I wanna save that light
I can't escape this now, unless you show me how

[Chorus]
When you feel my heat, look into my eyes
It's where my demons hide, it's where my demons hide
Don't get too close; it's dark inside
It's where my demons hide, it's where my demons hide

[Intro]
Whoah-oh
Whoah-oh
Whoah-oh
Whoah

[Verse 1]
I'm waking up to ash and dust
I wipe my brow and I sweat my rust
I'm breathing in the chemicals
Yeah, ah

[Refrain]
I'm breaking in, shaping up
Then checking out on the prison bus
This is it, the apocalypse
Whoa

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm waking up, I feel it in my bones
Enough to make my system blow
Welcome to the new age, to the new age
Welcome to the new age, to the new age

[Chorus]
Whoa-oh, whoa
I'm radioactive, radioactive
Whoa-oh, whoa
I'm radioactive, radioactive

[Verse 2]
I raise my flags, dye my clothes
It's a revolution, I suppose
We're painted red to fit right in
Whoa

[Refrain]
I'm breaking in, shaping up
Then checking out on the prison bus
This is it, the apocalypse
Whoa

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm waking up, I feel it in my bones
Enough to make my system blow
Welcome to the new age, to the new age
Welcome to the new age, to the new age

[Chorus]
Whoa-oh, whoa
I'm radioactive, radioactive
Whoa-oh, whoa
I'm radioactive, radioactive

[Bridge]
All systems go, the sun hasn't died
Deep in my bones, straight from inside

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm waking up, I feel it in my bones
Enough to make my system blow
Welcome to the new age, to the new age
Welcome to the new age, to the new age

[Chorus]
Whoa-oh, whoa
I'm radioactive, radioactive
Whoa-oh, whoa
I'm radioactive, radioactive

[Verse 1]
Will you hold the line
When every one of them has given up and given in? Tell me
In this house of mine
Nothing ever comes without a consequence or cost, tell me
Will the stars align?
Will Heaven step in? Will it save us from our sin? Will it?
'Cause this house of mine stands strong

[Pre-Chorus]
That's the price you pay
Leave behind your heart and cast away
Just another product of today
Rather be the hunter than the prey
And you're standing on the edge, face up 'cause you're a

[Chorus]
Natural
A beating heart of stone
You gotta be so cold
To make it in this world
Yeah, you're a natural
Living your life cutthroat
You gotta be so cold
Yeah, you're a natural

[Verse 2]
Will somebody
Let me see the light within the dark trees shadowing?
What's happenin'?
Lookin' through the glass, find the wrong within the past knowin'
Oh, we are the youth
Cut until it bleeds inside a world without the peace, facing
A bit of the truth, the truth

[Pre-Chorus]
That's the price you pay
Leave behind your heart and cast away
Just another product of today
Rather be the hunter than the prey
And you're standing on the edge, face up 'cause you're a

[Chorus]
Natural
A beating heart of stone
You gotta be so cold
To make it in this world
Yeah, you're a natural
Living your life cutthroat
You gotta be so cold
Yeah, you're a natural

[Bridge]
Deep inside me, I'm fading to black, I'm fading
Took an oath by the blood of my hand, won't break it
I can taste it, the end is upon us, I swear
I'm gonna make it
I'm gonna make it

[Chorus]
Natural
A beating heart of stone
You gotta be so cold
To make it in this world
Yeah, you're a natural
Living your life cutthroat
You gotta be so cold
Yeah, you're a natural

[Outro]
Natural
Yeah, you're a natural

[Verse 1]
Oh, hush, my dear, it's been a difficult year
And terrors don’t prey on innocent victims
Trust me, darlin', trust me darlin'
It’s been a loveless year
I'm a man of three fears:
Integrity, faith, and crocodile tears
Trust me, darlin', trust me, darlin'

[Pre-Chorus]
So look me in the eyes (Eyes), tell me what you see (You see)
Perfect paradise (—Dise), tearin' at the seams (Seams)
I wish I could escape it (Escape), I don't wanna fake it
Wish I could erase it (Erase), make your heart believe

[Chorus]
But I'm a bad liar, bad liar
Now you know, now you know
I'm a bad liar, bad liar
Now you know, you’re free to go

[Verse 2]
Did all my dreams never mean one thing?
Does happiness lie in a diamond ring?
Oh, I’ve been askin' for—
Oh, I’ve been askin' for problems, problems, problems
I wage my war, on the world inside
I take my gun to the enemy's side
Oh, I've been askin’ for— (Trust me, darlin')
Oh, I've been askin' for (Trust me, darlin') problems, problems, problems

[Pre-Chorus]
So look me in the eyes (Eyes), tell me what you see (You see)
Perfect paradise (—Dise), tearin' at the seams (Seams)
I wish I could escape it (Escape), I don't wanna fake it
Wish I could erase it (Erase), make your heart believe

[Chorus]
But I'm a bad liar, bad liar
Now you know, now you know
I'm a bad liar, bad liar
Now you know, you're free to go

[Bridge]
I can't breathe, I can't be
I can't be what you want me to be
Believe me, this one time
Believe me

[Chorus]
I'm a bad liar, bad liar
Now you know, now you know
I'm a bad liar, bad liar
Now you know, you're free to go

[Outro]
Oh-oh-oh
Please believe me
Please believe me

[Verse 1]
There she goes in front of me
Take my life and set me free again
We'll make a memory out of it
Holy road is at my back
Don't look on, take me back again
We'll make a memory out of it

[Pre-Chorus]
We finally fall apart
And we break each other's hearts
If we wanna live young, love
We better start today

[Chorus]
It's gotta get easier and easier somehow
'Cause I'm falling, I'm falling
Oh, easier and easier somehow
Oh, I'm calling, I'm calling
And it isn't over unless it is over
I don't wanna wait for that
It's gotta get easier and easier somehow
But not today, not today

[Verse 2]
There she goes in front of me
Take my life, set me free again
We'll make a memory out of it
Holy road was at my back
Don't look on, take me back again
We'll make a memory out of it

[Pre-Chorus]
We finally fall apart
And we break each other's hearts
If we wanna live young, love
We better start today

[Chorus]
It's gotta get easier and easier somehow
'Cause I'm falling, I'm falling
Oh, easier and easier somehow
Oh, I'm calling, I'm calling
And it isn't over unless it is over
I don't wanna wait for that
It's gotta get easier and easier

[Bridge]
So come with me
You'll come with me
So come with me
You'll come with me
Not today
Not today
Not today
Not today

[Chorus]
It's gotta get easier and easier somehow
'Cause I'm falling, I'm falling
Oh, easier and easier somehow
Oh, I'm calling, I'm calling
And it isn't over unless it is over
I don't wanna wait for that
It's gotta get easier and easier somehow
It's gotta get easier and easier somehow
Not today, not today
Not today, not today
Not today

[Music Film Opening Dialogue]

[Verse 1]
Something about the way that you walked into my living room
Casually and confident lookin' at the mess I am
But still you, still you want me
Stress lines and cigarettes, politics, and deficits
Late bills and overages, screamin' and hollerin'
But still you, still you want me

[Chorus]
Oh, I always let you down
You're shattered on the ground
But still, I find you there
Next to me
And oh, stupid things I do
I'm far from good, it's true
But still, I find you
Next to me (next to me)

[Verse 2]
There's something about the way that you always see the pretty view
Overlook the blooded mess, always lookin' effortless
And still you, still you want me
I got no innocence, faith ain't no privilege
I am a deck of cards, vice or a game of hearts
And still you, still you want me

[Chorus]
Oh, I always let you down
You're shattered on the ground
But still, I find you there
Next to me
And oh, stupid things I do
I'm far from good, it's true
But still, I find you
Next to me (next to me)

[Bridge]
Oh
So thank you for taking a chance on me
I know it isn't easy
But I hope to be worth it (Oh)
So thank you for taking a chance on me
I know it isn't easy
But I hope to be worth it (Oh)

[Music Film Aja's Revelation]

[Chorus]
Oh, I always let you down (I always let you down)
You're shattered on the ground, (Shattered on the ground)
But still, I find you there (Yeah)
Next to me
And, oh, stupid things I do (Stupid things I do)
I'm far from good, it's true
But still, I find you
Next to me (Next to me)

[Music Film Closing Dialogue]

[Verse 1]
Do you feel the same when I'm away from you? (Oo-ooh, oo-ooh)
Do you know the line that I'd walk for you? (Oo-ooh, oo-ooh)
We could turn around or we could give it up
But we'll take what comes, take what comes

[Verse 2]
Oh, the storm is ragin' against us now (Oo-ooh, oo-ooh)
If you're afraid of falling, then don't look down (Oo-ooh, oo-ooh)
But we took the step, oh, we took the leap
And we'll take what comes, take what comes

[Pre-Chorus]
Feel the wind in your hair
Feel the rush way up here

[Chorus]
We're walkin' the wire, love
We're walkin' the wire, love
We couldn't be higher, up
We're walkin' the wire, wire, wire

[Verse 3]
There's nights we had to just walk away (Oo-ooh, oo-ooh)
And there's tears we'll cry, but those tears will fade (Oo-ooh, oo-ooh)
It's a price you pay when it comes to love
And we'll take what comes, take what comes

[Pre-Chorus]
Feel the wind in your hair
Feel the rush way up here

[Chorus]
We're walkin' the wire, love
We're walkin' the wire, love
We couldn't be higher, up
We're walkin' the wire, wire, wire

[Bridge]
So look out down below
Look out down below
Look out down below
Walkin' the wire, wire, wire
So look out down below

[Verse 4]
Oh, I'll take your hand when thunder roars
And I'll hold you close, I'll stay the course
I promise you from up above
That we'll take what comes, take what comes, love

[Chorus]
We're walkin' the wire, love
We're walkin' the wire, love
We couldn't be higher, up (Couldn't be, couldn't be)
We're walkin' the wire, wire, wire

[Outro]
So look out down below
Look out down below
Look out down below
Walkin' the wire, wire, wire
So look out down below
We're walkin' the wire
We're walkin' the wire
We're walkin' the wire, wire, wire

[Verse 1]
So this is what you meant
When you said that you were spent
And now it's time to build from the bottom of the pit
Right to the top
Don't hold back
Packing my bags and giving the academy a rain check

[Pre-Chorus]
I don't ever wanna let you down
I don't ever wanna leave this town
'Cause after all
This city never sleeps at night

[Chorus]
It's time to begin, isn't it?
I get a little bit bigger, but then I'll admit
I'm just the same as I was
Now don't you understand
That I'm never changing who I am

[Verse 2]
So this is where you fell
And I am left to sell
The path to heaven runs through miles of clouded hell
Right to the top
Don't look back
Turn in the rags and giving the commodities a rain check

[Pre-Chorus]
I don't ever wanna let you down
I don't ever wanna leave this town
'Cause after all
This city never sleeps at night

[Chorus]
It's time to begin, isn't it?
I get a little bit bigger, but then I'll admit
I'm just the same as I was
Now don't you understand
That I'm never changing who I am
It's time to begin, isn't it?
I get a little bit bigger, but then I'll admit
I'm just the same as I was
Now don't you understand
That I'm never changing who I am

[Bridge]
This road never looked so lonely
This house doesn't burn down slowly
To ashes, to ashes

[Chorus]
It's time to begin, isn't it?
I get a little bit bigger, but then I'll admit
I'm just the same as I was
Now don't you understand
That I'm never changing who I am
It's time to begin, isn't it?
I get a little bit bigger, but then I'll admit
I'm just the same as I was
Now don't you understand
That I'm never changing who I am

[Verse 1]
I find it hard to say the things I want to say the most
Find a little bit of steady as I get close
Find a balance in the middle of the chaos
Send me low, send me high, send me never demigod
I remember walking in the cold of November
Hoping that I make it to the end of December
27 years and the end on my mind
But holding to the thought of another time

[Pre-Chorus]
But looking to the ways of the ones before me
Looking for the path of the young and lonely
I don't wanna hear about what to do
I don’t wanna do it just to do it for you

[Chorus]
Hello, hello
Let me tell you what it's like to be a zero, zero
Let me show you what it's like to always feel, feel
Like I’m empty and there's nothing really real, real
I'm looking for a way out
Hello, hello
Let me tell you what it's like to be a zero, zero
Let me show you what it's like to never feel, feel
Like I'm good enough for anything that's real, real
I'm looking for a way out

[Verse 2]
I find it hard to tell you how I wanna run away
I understand it always makes you feel a certain way
I find a balance in the middle of the chaos
Send me up, send me down, send me ’nother demigod
I remember walking in the heat of the summer
Wide-eyed one with a mind full of wonder
27 years and I’ve nothing to show
Falling from the dove to the dark of the crow

[Pre-Chorus]
Looking to the ways of the ones before me
Looking for the path of the young and lonely
I don't wanna hear about what to do, no
I don’t wanna do it just to do it for you

[Chorus]
Hello, hello
Let me tell you what it's like to be a zero, zero
Let me show you what it's like to always feel, feel
Like I'm empty and there’s nothing really real, real
I'm looking for a way out
Hello, hello
Let me tell you what it's like to be a zero, zero
Let me show you what it's like to never feel, feel
Like I'm good enough for anything that's real, real
I'm looking for a way out

[Bridge]
Let me tell you 'bout it, well let me tell you 'bout it
Maybe you're the same as me
Let me tell you 'bout it, well let me tell you 'bout it
They say the truth will set you free

[Chorus]
Hello, hello
Let me tell you what it's like to be a zero, zero
Let me show you what it's like to always feel, feel
Like I'm empty and there's nothing really real, real
I'm looking for a way out
Hello, hello
Let me tell you what it's like to be a zero, zero
Let me show you what it's like to never feel, feel
Like I'm good enough for anything that's real, real
I'm looking for a way out

[Verse 1]
I was hopin' for an indication
I was seekin' higher elevation
Aye aye aye, aye aye aye
I've been shaken, wakin' in the night light
I've been breakin', hidin' from the spotlight
Aye aye aye, aye aye aye

[Pre-Chorus]
The more I stray, the less I fear
And the more I reach, the more I fade away
The darkness right in front of me
Oh, it's calling out, and I won't walk away

[Chorus]
I would always open up the door
Always lookin' up for higher floors
Wanna see it all give me more (Rise, rise up)
I was always up for makin' changes
Walkin' down the street meetin' strangers
Flippin' through my life turnin' pages (Rise, rise up)

[Verse 2]
Like a prayer that only needs a reason
Like a hunter waiting for the season
Aye aye aye, aye aye aye
I was there, but I was always leaving
I've been livin', but I was never breathing
Aye aye aye, aye aye aye

[Pre-Chorus]
The more I stray, the less I fear
And the more I reach, the more I fade away
The darkness right in front of me
Oh, it's calling out, and I won't walk away

[Chorus]
I would always open up the door
Always lookin' up for higher floors
Wanna see it all give me more (Rise, rise up)
I was always up for makin' changes
Walkin' down the street meetin' strangers
Flippin' through my life turnin' pages (Rise, rise up)

[Bridge]
I'm burstin' like the Fourth of July
So color me and blow me away
I'm broken in the prime of my life
So embrace it and leave me to stray

[Chorus]
I would always open up the door
Always lookin' up for higher floors
Wanna see it all give me more (Rise, rise up)
I was always up for makin' changes
Walkin' down the street meetin' strangers
Flippin' through my life turnin' pages (rise, rise up)
I would always open up the door
Always lookin' up for higher floors
Want to see it all give me more (Rise, rise up)
I was always up for makin' changes
Walkin' down the street meetin' strangers
Flippin' through my life turnin' pages (Rise, rise up)

[Outro]
(Rise, rise up)
(Rise, rise up)

[Verse 1]
We could be strangers in the night
We could be passing in the shadows
We couldn't be closer if we tried
When we're caught in the headlights
We could be faces in the crowd
We could be passin' in the shadows
Lovin' the risk of bein' found
When we're caught in the headlights

[Pre-Chorus]
Dangerous
Your love is always dangerous
And now I'm lost in us
We're livin' in a lie of trust

[Chorus]
I don't know why
But I guess it's got somethin' to do with you
To do with you
I don't know why
But I guess it's got somethin' to do with you
To do with you

[Verse 2]
I was a vacant alibi
Trading the truth in for a lie, oh
We were the essence of desire
And we're caught in the headlights

[Pre-Chorus]
Dangerous
Your love is always dangerous
And now I'm lost in us
We're livin' in a lie of trust

[Chorus]
I don't know why
But I guess it's got somethin' to do with you
To do with you
I don't know why
But I guess it's got somethin' to do with you
To do with you (I don't know, ah)
I don't know why
But I guess it's got somethin' to do with you (I don't know)
To do with you (I don't know, ah)
I don't know why
But I guess it's got somethin' to do with you
To do with you

[Bridge]
Tell me that you love me
Tell me that you love me
Tell me that you love me
Tell me that you love me
Tell me that you love me
Dangerous
Tell me that you love me
Tell me that you love me
Your love is always dangerous
Tell me that you love me

[Breakdown]
I don't know why

[Chorus]
I don't know why (Ah)
But I guess it's got somethin' to do with you (I don't know)
To do with you (I don't know, ah)
I don't know why
But I guess it's got somethin' to do with you (To do with you)
To do with you (I don't know, ah)
I don't know why
But I guess it's got somethin' to do with you (To do with you) (I don't know)
To do with you (I don't know, ah)
I don't know why
But I guess it's got somethin' to do with you
To do with you

[Verse 1]
If you love somebody
Better tell them while they're here 'cause
They just may run away from you
You'll never know quite when, well
Then again, it just depends on
How long of time is left for you
I've had the highest mountains
I've had the deepest rivers
You can have it all, but life keeps moving

[Pre-Chorus]
Now take it in but don't look down...

[Chorus]
'Cause I'm on top of the world, hey
I'm on top of the world, hey
Waiting on this for a while now
Paying my dues to the dirt
I've been waiting to smile, hey
Been holding it in for a while, hey
Take you with me if I can
Been dreaming of this since a child
I'm on top of the world

[Verse 2]
I've tried to cut these corners
Try to take the easy way out
I kept on falling short of something
I could've gave up then, but
Then again, I couldn't have 'cause
I've traveled all this way for something

[Pre-Chorus]
Now take it in, but don't look down...

[Chorus]
'Cause I'm on top of the world, hey
I'm on top of the world, hey
Waiting on this for a while now
Paying my dues to the dirt
I've been waiting to smile, hey
Been holding it in for a while, hey
Take you with me if I can
Been dreaming of this since a child
I'm on top of the world

[Post-Chorus]
Oh-woah, oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh-woah, oh-oh

[Chorus]
'Cause I'm on top of the world, hey
I'm on top of the world, hey
Waiting on this for a while now
Paying my dues to the dirt
I've been waiting to smile, hey
Been holding it in for a while, hey
Take you with me if I can
Been dreaming of this since a child

[Bridge]
And I know it's hard when you're falling down
And it's a long way up when you hit the ground, but
Get up, now, get up, get up, now
And I know it's hard when you're falling down
And it's a long way up when you hit the ground, but
Get up, now, get up, get up, now

[Outro]
'Cause I'm on top of the world, hey
(And I know it's hard when you're falling down)
I'm on top of the world, hey
(And it's a long way up when you hit the ground, but)
Waiting on this for a while now
(Get up, now, get up)
Paying my dues to the dirt
(Get up, now)
I've been waiting to smile, hey
(And I know it's hard when you're falling down)
Been holding it in for a while, hey
(And it's a long way up when you hit the ground, but)
Take you with me if I can
(Get up, now, get up)
Been dreaming of this since a child
(Get up, now)
I'm on top of the world

[Verse 1]
As a child, you would wait and watch from far away
But you always knew that you'd be the one
That work while they all play
In youth, you'd lay awake at night and scheme
Of all the things that you would change
But it was just a dream

[Chorus]
Here we are, don't turn away now (Don't turn away)
We are the warriors that built this town (This town)
Here we are, don't turn away now (Don't turn away)
We are the warriors that built this town (This town)
From dust

[Verse 2]
The time will come, when you'll have to rise
Above the rest and prove yourself
Your spirit never dies
Farewell, I've gone to take my throne above
But don't weep for me, 'cause this will be
The labor of my love

[Chorus]
Here we are, don't turn away now (Don't turn away)
We are the warriors that built this town (This town)
Here we are, don't turn away now (Don't turn away)
We are the warriors that built this town (This town)
From dust

[Guitar Solo]

[Chorus]
Here we are, don't turn away now (Don't turn away)
We are the warriors that built this town (This town)
Here we are, don't turn away now (Don't turn away)
We are the warriors that built this town (This town)
From dust

[Verse 1]
Two hearts, one valve
Pumpin' the blood, we were the flood
We were the body and
Two lives, one life
Stickin' it out, lettin' you down
Makin' it right

[Pre-Chorus]
Seasons, they will change
Life will make you grow
Change will make you cry, cry, cry
Everything is temporary
Everything will slide
Love will never die, die, die

[Chorus]
I know that
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Birds fly in different directions
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
I hope to see you again

[Verse 2]
Sunsets, sunrises
Livin' the dream, watchin' the leaves
Changin' the seasons
Some nights I think of you
Relivin' the past, wishin' it'd last
Wishin' and dreamin'

[Pre-Chorus]
Seasons, they will change
Life will make you grow
Death can make you hard, hard, hard
Everything is temporary
Everything will slide
Love will never die, die, die

[Chorus]
I know that
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Birds fly in different directions
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
I hope to see you again
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Birds fly in different directions
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
So fly high, so fly high

[Bridge]
When the moon is lookin' down
Shinin' light upon your ground
I'm flyin' up to let you see
That the shadow cast is me

[Chorus]
I know that
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Birds fly in different directions
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
I hope to see you again
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Birds fly in different directions
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
So fly high, so fly high
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
So fly high, so fly high
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
So fly high, so fly high

[Verse 1]
All my life been sittin' at the table
Watchin' them kids, they're living in a fable
Looks, luck, money and never left a'wishin'
But now it's 'bout time to raise up and petition
All my life been sittin' at the table
Watching them kids, they're living in a fable
Looks, luck, money and never left a'wishin'
Now it's 'bout time to stand up and petition

[Chorus]
'Cause I've been wondering
When you gonna see I'm not for sale
I've been questioning
When you gonna see I'm not a part of your machine
Not a part of your machine

[Verse 2]
I'm not scared of what you're gonna tell me
No, I'm not scared of the beast in the belly
Fill my cup with endless ambition
And paint this town with my very own vision
I'm not scared of what you're gonna tell me
And I'm not scared of the beast in the belly
Fill my cup with endless ambition
And paint this town with my very own vision

[Chorus]
'Cause I've been wondering
When you gonna see I'm not for sale
I've been questioning
When you gonna see I'm not a part of your machine
Not a part of your machine
I am the machine

[Guitar Solo]
I am the machine

[Outro]
'Cause I've been wondering
When you gonna see I'm not for sale

When you gonna see I'm not a part of your machine

When you gonna see I'm not a part of your machine
Not a part of your machine

[Intro]

[Verse 1]
About time for anyone telling you
Off for all your deeds
No sign the roaring thunder
Stopped in cold to read (No time)

[Pre-Chorus]
I get mine and make no excuses
Waste of precious breath (no time)
The sun shines on everyone
Everyone, love yourself to death

[Chorus]
So you gotta fire up, you gotta let go
You'll never be loved 'til you’ve made your own
You gotta face up, you gotta get yours
You never know the top 'til you get too low

[Post-Chorus]
A son of a stepfather
A son of a, I'm so sorry
A son of a stepfather
A son of a, I'm so sorry

[Verse 2]
No lies and no deceiving
Man is what he loves
I keep tryin' to conceive that
Death is from above (No time)

[Pre-Chorus]
I get mine and make no excuses
Waste of precious breath (No time)
The sun shines on everyone
Everyone, love yourself to death

[Chorus]
So you gotta fire up, you gotta let go
You'll never be loved 'til you’ve made your own
You gotta face up, you gotta get yours
You never know the top 'til you get too low

[Post-Chorus]
A son of a stepfather
A son of a, I'm so sorry
A son of a stepfather
A son of a, I'm so sorry

[Bridge]
Life isn't always what you think it’d be
Turn your head for one second and the tables turn
And I know, I know that I did you wrong
But will you trust me when I say that I'll make it up to you?
Somehow, somehow?

[Chorus]
So you gotta fire up, you gotta let go
You'll never be loved 'til you’ve made your own
You gotta face up, you gotta get yours
You never know the top 'til you get too low

[Post-Chorus]
A son of a stepfather
A son of a, I'm so sorry
A son of a stepfather
A son of a, I'm so sorry
I'm so sorry
I'm so sorry
I'm so sorry
A son of a

(I bet, I bet my life)
(I bet, I bet my life)

[Verse 1]
I know I took the path
That you would never want for me
I know I let you down, didn't I?
So many sleepless nights
Where you were waiting up on me
Well, I'm just a slave unto the night

[Pre-Chorus]
(I bet, I bet my life)
Now remember when I told you (I)
That's the last you'll see of me? (I)
Remember when I broke you down to tears? (I)

I know I took the path
That you would never want for me (I)
I gave you hell through all the years (I)

So I, I bet my life
I bet my life, I bet my life on you
I, I bet my life
I bet my life, I bet my life on you

I've been around the world
And never in my wildest dreams
Would I come runnin' home to you
(I bet, I bet my life)
I've told a million lies (I)
But now I tell a single truth (I)
There's you in everything I do (I)
(Woo-oooo-ooh)

[Pre-Chorus]
Now remember when I told you
That's the last you'll see of me?
Remember when I broke you down to tears?
I know I took the path
That you would never want for me
I gave you hell through all the years

[Chorus]
So I, I bet my life
I bet my life, I bet my life on you
I, I bet my life
I bet my life, I bet my life on you

[Bridge]
Don't tell me that I'm wrong
I've walked that road before
And left you on your own
And please believe them when they say
That it's left for yesterday
And the records that I play
Please forgive me for all I've done

[Chorus]
So I, I bet my life
I bet my life, I bet my life on you
I, I bet my life
I bet my life, I bet my life on you
Ehe-yee-eee

But then you print some shit that makes me wanna scream

[Pre-Chorus: Lady Gaga]
So do what you want, what you want with my body
Do what you want, don't stop, let's party
Do what you want, what you want with my body
Do what you want, what you want with my body
Write what you want, say what you want 'bout me
If you're wondering, know that I'm not sorry
Do what you want, what you want with my body
What you want with my body

[Chorus: Lady Gaga]
You can't have my heart, and you won't use my mind
But do what you want with my body
Do what you want with my body
You can’t stop my voice 'cause you don't own my life
But do what you want with my body
Do what you want with my body

[Verse 2: R. Kelly]
Early morning, longer nights (Yeah)
Tom Ford, private flights (Yeah)
Crazy schedule, fast life
I wouldn't trade it in, 'cause it's our life
(But let's slow it down)
I could be the drink in your cup
I could be the green in your blunt, your pusher man
Yeah, I got what you want
You wanna escape (Oh)
All of the crazy shit (Let go)
You're the Marilyn, I'm the president
And I love to hear you sing (Girl)

[Pre-Chorus 2: R. Kelly]
Do what I want, do what I want with your body
Do what I want, do what I want with your body
Back of the club, taking shots, gettin' naughty
No invitations, it's a private party
Do what I want, do what I want with your body
Do what I want, do what I want with your body
Yeah, we taking these haters and we roughin' 'em up
And we layin’ the cut like we don't give a fuck

[Chorus: Lady Gaga & R. Kelly]
You can't have my heart, and you won't use my mind (My mind)
But do what you want with my body (Yeah)
Do what you want with my body (With your body)
You can’t stop my voice 'cause you don't own my life
But do what you want with my body
Do what you want with my body (Body)

[Bridge: Lady Gaga]
Sometimes I'm scared, I suppose
If you ever let me go
I would fall apart if you break my heart
So just take my body and don't stop the party

[Chorus: Lady Gaga & R. Kelly, Both]
You can't have my heart and (Help me now)
You won't use my mind
But do what you want with my body
Do what you want with my body (With your body)
You can’t stop my voice, 'cause
You don't own my life (You)
But do what you want with my body
(What I want, when I want, when I want)
Do what you want with my body

[Outro: Lady Gaga]
Do what you want with me
What you want with my body
Do what you want with me
What you want with my body, world
Do what you want with me
What you want with my body
Do what you want with me
What you want with my body, world
Help me now
What you want with my body
Do what you want with my body
Do what you want with my body
Want you want with my body, world

[Verse 1]
That Arizona sky
Burnin' in your eyes
You look at me and babe, I wanna catch on fire
It’s buried in my soul
Like California gold
You found the light in me that I couldn’t find

[Chorus]
So when I'm all choked up and I can't find the words
Every time we say goodbye, baby, it hurts
When the sun goes down
And the band won't play
I'll always remember us this way

[Verse 2]
Lovers in the night
Poets tryna write
We don't know how to rhyme, but damn, we try
But all I really know
You're where I wanna go
The part of me that's you will never die

[Chorus]
So when I'm all choked up and I can't find the words
Every time we say goodbye, baby, it hurts
When the sun goes down
And the band won't play
I'll always remember us this way

[Bridge]
Oh yeah
I don't wanna be just a memory, baby, yeah
Hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo
Hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo
Hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo hoo hooooooooo

[Chorus]
So when I'm all choked up and I can't find the words
Every time we say goodbye, baby, it hurts
When the sun goes down and the band won't play
I'll always remember us this way
Way yeah

[Outro]
When you look at me and the whole world fades
I'll always remember us this way

[Outro]
Oooh, oooh, hmmmm
Oooh, oooh, hmmmm

[Verse 1]
(Last night)
Our lovers' quarrel
(I was thinking about you)
Hurts more than I can say
(And it was kind of dirty)
All night
(And the way that you looked at me)
Help me here
(It was kind of nasty, aah!)
Help me here
(It was kind of trashy)
'Cause I can't help my mind from going there!

[Pre-Chorus]
Heard your boyfriend was away this weekend
Wanna meet at my place?
Heard that we both got nothing to do
When I lay in bed, I touch myself and think of you

[Chorus]
Last night
Damn, you were in my sex dreams (You were in my)
Doing really nasty things (You were in my dreams)
Damn, you were in my sex dreams (You were in my)
Making love in my sex dreams

[Verse 2]
We could be caught
(I just want this to be perfect)
We're both convicted criminals of thought
('Cause I'm broken)
Let's white
(By the one before)
Glove the bed
(He was kind of nasty)
Help me here
(And I feel so trashy)
'Cause we can't hide the evidence in our heads!

[Pre-Chorus]
Heard your boyfriend was away this weekend
Wanna meet at my place?
Heard that we both got nothing to do (Woo)
When I lay in bed, I touch myself and think of you

[Chorus]
Last night
Damn, you were in my sex dreams (You were in my)
Doing really nasty things (You were in my dreams)
Damn, you were in my sex dreams (You were in my)
Making love in my sex dreams

[Post-Chorus]
Don't stop the party (Making love in my sex dreams)
Let's keep it naughty, yeah (Making love in my sex dreams)
Watch me act a fool (Making love in my sex dreams)
Tomorrow when I run into you, tomorrow when I run into you

[Bridge]
You could turn to stone
Or the color of men petrified by a woman
In love as I am when I lay with you
I think of him, I think of him

[Spoken Interlude]
I can't believe I'm telling you this, but I've had a couple drinks and...
Oh my God!

[Chorus]
Last night
Damn, you were in my sex dreams (You were in my)
Doing really nasty things (You were in my dreams)
Damn, you were in my sex dreams (You were in my)
Making love in my sex dreams

[Post-Chorus]
Don't stop the party (Damn, you were in my sex dreams)
Let's keep it naughty, yeah (Doing really nasty things)
Watch me act a fool (Damn, you were in my sex dreams)
Tomorrow when I run into you (Making love in my sex dreams)

[iTunes Festival Demo Bridge]
We were in the swimming pool
I was naked, boy, so were you
And we bumped this song while we made love
Dangerous poetry rhymed with our bodies
And now it's time for the trial with doubts and drawls
I can't believe I'm telling you this, but I've had a couple drinks and...
Oh my God!

[Verse 1]
Wish I could, I could've said goodbye
I would've said what I wanted to
Maybe even cried for you
If I knew, it would be the last time
I would've broke my heart in two
Tryin' to save a part of you

[Chorus]
Don't want to feel another touch
Don't wanna start another fire
Don't wanna know another kiss
No other name falling off my lips
Don't wanna to give my heart away
To another stranger
Or let another day begin
Won't even let the sunlight in
No, I'll never love again
I'll never love again
Ooouuu ooou oou

Oh

[Verse 2]
When we first met
I never thought that I would fall
I never thought that I'd find myself
Lying in your arms
And I want to pretend that it's not true
Oh baby, that you're gone
'Cause my world keeps turning, and turning, and turning
And I'm not movin' on

[Chorus]
Don't want to feel another touch
Don't wanna start another fire
Don't wanna know another kiss
No other name falling off my lips
Don't wanna give my heart away
To another stranger
Or let another day begin
Won't even let the sunlight in
No, I'll never love

[Bridge]
I don't wanna know this feeling
Unless it's you and me
I don't wanna waste a moment, ooh
And I don't wanna give somebody else the better part of me
I would rather wait for you
Hoooo ouuu

[Chorus]
Don't want to feel another touch
Don't want to start another fire
Don't want to know another kiss
Baby unless they are your lips
Don't want to give my heart away to another stranger
Or let another day begin
Won't even let the sunlight in
Oooo I'll never love again
Love again
I'll never love again
I'll never love
Again

[Outro]
I won't I won't I swear I can't
I wish I could but I just won't
I'll never love again
I'll never love
Again
Who oo oo oo oo
Hmmm

[Verse 1]
You're giving me a million reasons to let you go
You're giving me a million reasons to quit the show
You're givin' me a million reasons
Give me a million reasons
Givin' me a million reasons
About a million reasons

If I had a highway, I would run for the hills
If you could find a dry way, I'd forever be still
But you're giving me a million reasons
Give me a million reasons
Givin' me a million reasons
About a million reasons

[Chorus]
I bow down to pray
I try to make the worst seem better
Lord, show me the way
To cut through all his worn out leather
I've got a hundred million reasons to walk away
But baby, I just need one good one to stay

[Verse 2]
Head stuck in a cycle, I look off and I stare
It's like that I've stopped breathing, but completely aware
'Cause you're giving me a million reasons
Give me a million reasons
Givin' me a million reasons
About a million reasons

And if you say something that you might even mean
It's hard to even fathom which parts I should believe
'Cause you're giving me a million reasons
Give me a million reasons
Givin' me a million reasons
About a million reasons

[Chorus]
I bow down to pray
I try to make the worst seem better
Lord, show me the way
To cut through all his worn out leather
I've got a hundred million reasons to walk away
But baby, I just need one good one to stay

[Bridge]
Hey, ehh, ehh, eyy
Baby I'm bleedin', bleedin'
Stay, ehh, ehhy
Can't you give me what I'm needin', needin'
Every heartbreak makes it hard to keep the faith
But baby, I just need one good one
Good one, good one, good one, good one, good one

[Chorus]
When I bow down to pray
I try to make the worst seem better
Lord, show me the way
To cut through all his worn out leather
I've got a hundred million reasons to walk away
But baby, I just need one good one, good one
Tell me that you'll be the good one, good one
Baby, I just need one good one to stay

[Intro]
It doesn't matter if you love him, or capital "H-I-M" (M, M, M)
Just put your paws up
'Cause you were born this way, baby

[Verse 1]
My mama told me when I was young
"We are all born superstars"
She rolled my hair and put my lipstick on
In the glass of her boudoir
"There's nothing wrong with loving who you are"
She said, "'Cause he made you perfect, babe"
"So hold your head up, girl, and you'll go far, listen to me when I say"

[Chorus]
I'm beautiful in my way
'Cause God makes no mistakes
I'm on the right track, baby
I was born this way
Don't hide yourself in regret
Just love yourself, and you're set
I'm on the right track, baby
I was born this way (Born this way)

[Post-Chorus]
Ooh, there ain't no other way
Baby, I was born this way
Baby, I was born this way (Born this way)
Ooh, there ain't no other way

Don't be a drag, just be a queen
Don't be a drag, just be a queen
Don't be a drag, just be a queen
Don't be (Don't be, don't be)

[Verse 2]
Give yourself prudence and love your friends
Subway kid, rejoice your truth
In the religion of the insecure
I must be myself, respect my youth
A different lover is not a sin
Believe capital H-I-M
Hey, hey, hey
I love my life, I love this record and
Mi amore vole fe yah (Same DNA)

[Chorus]
I'm beautiful in my way
'Cause God makes no mistakes
I'm on the right track, baby
I was born this way

Just love yourself, and you're set

I was born this way (Born this way)

[Post-Chorus]
Ooh, there ain't no other way
Baby, I was born this way
Baby, I was born this way (Born this way)
Ooh, there ain't no other way

(Way) Church

[Breakdown]
Don't be a drag, just be a queen
Whether you're broke or evergreen
You're black, white, beige, cholo descent
You're Lebanese, you're orient
Whether life's disabilities
Left you outcast, bullied, or teased
Rejoice and love yourself today
'Cause baby, you were born this way

[Bridge]
No matter gay, straight, or bi
Lesbian, transgender life
I'm on the right track, baby
I was born to survive
No matter black, white, or beige
Chola or orient made
I'm on the right track, baby
I was born to be brave!

[Chorus]
I'm beautiful in my way
'Cause God makes no mistakes
I'm on the right track, baby
I was born this way
Don't hide yourself in regret

I was born this way, hey
I was born this way, hey
I'm on the right track, baby
I was born this way, hey
Same DNA, but born this way (Hey, hey, hey)
Same DNA, but born this way (Hey, hey, hey)

[Verse 1]
Tryin' to get control
Pressure's takin' its toll
Stuck in the middle zone
I just want you alone
My guessing game is strong
Way too real to be wrong
Caught up in your show
Yeah, at least now I know

[Chorus]
It wasn't love, it wasn't love
It was a perfect illusion (Perfect illusion)
Mistaken for love, it wasn't love
It was a perfect illusion (Perfect illusion)
You were a perfect illusion

[Verse 2]
I don't need eyes to see
I felt you touchin' me
High like amphetamine
Maybe you're just a dream
That's what it means to crush
Now that I'm wakin' up
I still feel the blow
But at least now I know

[Chorus]
It wasn't love, it wasn't love
It was a perfect illusion (Perfect illusion)
Mistaken for love, it wasn't love
It was a perfect illusion (Perfect illusion)

[Bridge]
Where are you?
'Cause I can't see you
It was a perfect illusion
But I feel you watchin' me
Dilated, falling free
In a modern ecstasy
Where are you?
'Cause I can't see you
It was a perfect illusion
But I feel you watchin' me
But I feel you watchin' me
Illusion
But I feel you watchin' me
Mistaken for love
Where were you
'Cause I can't see
But I feel you watchin' me
Mistaken for love
Dilated, falling free
In a modern ecstasy
Mistaken for love
In a modern ecstasy
In a modern ecstasy

I'm over the show
Yeah at least now I know

[Chorus]
It wasn't love, it wasn't love
It was a perfect illusion (Perfect illusion)
Mistaken for love, it wasn't love
It was a perfect illusion (Perfect illusion)
You were a perfect illusion
You were a perfect illusion
It was a perfect illusion
Somewhere in all the confusion
It was a perfect illusion, illusion (illusion)

[Outro]
Where were you 'cause I can't see it
It was perfect illusion
But I feel you watchin' me, baby
Somewhere in all the confusion
Dilated, fallin' free
You were so perfect
In a modern ecstasy
You were a perfect illusion

[Intro]
I am so fab
Check out:
I'm blonde, I'm skinny
I'm rich, and I'm a little bit of a bitch

[Verse 1]
I wanna dress you up in silk
Taffeta
Tailor these clothes to fit your guilt
What's your size?
This purse can hold my black card
And tiara
Versace promises I will
Dolce Vita

What do you wanna wear this spring?
What do you think is the new thing?
What do you wanna wear this season?

[Chorus]

[Post-Chorus]
Donatella!
'Cause she walks so bad like it feels so good
Listen to her radiate her magic
Even though she knows she’s misunderstood
Voodoo, voodoo
Voo-don-na-na

[Verse 2]
Walk down the runway, but don’t puke
It’s okay
You just had a salad today
Boulangerie
Just ask your gay friends their advice
Before you...
Get a spray tan on holiday
In Taipei

[Pre-Chorus]
What do you wanna wear this spring?
What do you think is the new thing?
What do you wanna wear this season?

[Chorus]
Donatella!

[Intro]
I killed my former and
Left her in the trunk on highway 10
Put the knife under the hood
If you find it, send it straight to Hollywood
[Laughter]
Aura-a-a-a, aura-a-a-a
Aura-a-a-a, aura-a-a-a
Aura-a-a-a, aura-a-a-a
Aura-a-a-a

[Verse 1]
I'm not a wandering slave, I am a woman of choice
My veil is protection for the gorgeousness of my face
You ought to pity me 'cause was arranged one man to love
But in the bedroom, the size of him's more than enough

[Chorus]
Do you wanna see me naked, lover?
Do you wanna peek underneath the cover?
Do you wanna see the girl who lives behind the aura, behind the aura?
Do you wanna touch me, cosmic lover?
Do you wanna peek underneath the cover?
Do you wanna see the girl who lives behind the aura?
Behind the aura, behind the aura, behind the aura?

[Verse 2]
Enigma popstar is fun, she wear burqa for fashion
It's not a statement as much as just a move of passion
I may not walk on your street or shoot a gun on your soil
I hear you screaming, is it because of pleasure or toil?

[Bridge]
Dance, sex, art, pop, tech
Dance, sex, art, pop, tech

[Chorus]
Do you wanna see me naked, lover?
Do you wanna peek underneath the cover?
Do you wanna see the girl who lives behind the aura, behind the aura?
Do you wanna touch me, cosmic lover?
Do you wanna peek underneath the cover?
Do you wanna see the girl who lives behind the aura?
Behind the aura, behind the curtain, behind the burqa

[Outro]
ART-POP

[Verse 1: Lady Gaga]
Hello, hello? Baby, you called, I can't hear a thing
I have got no service in the club, you say, say?
Wha-wha-what did you say, huh? You're breaking up on me
Sorry, I cannot hear you, I'm kind of busy
K-kind of busy, k-kind of busy
Sorry, I cannot hear you, I'm kind of busy

[Verse 2: Lady Gaga]
Just a second, it's my favorite song they're gonna play
And I cannot text you with a drink in my hand, eh
You should've made some plans with me, you knew that I was free
And now you won't stop calling me, I'm kind of busy

[Chorus: Lady Gaga]
Stop calling, stop calling, I don't wanna think anymore
I left my head and my heart on the dance floor
Stop calling, stop calling, I don't wanna talk anymore
I left my head and my heart on the dance floor

[Post-Chorus: Lady Gaga]
Eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh
Stop telephoning me!
Eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh (Stop telephoning me)
I'm busy!
Eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh (I'm busy)
Stop telephoning me!
Eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh (Stop telephoning me)

[Refrain: Lady Gaga]
Can call all you want but there's no one home
And you're not gonna reach my telephone
'Cause I'm out in the club and I'm sipping that bubb
And you're not gonna reach my telephone
Can call all you want but there's no one home
And you're not gonna reach my telephone
'Cause I'm out in the club and I'm sipping that bubb
And you're not gonna reach my telephone

[Verse 3: Beyoncé]
Boy, the way you blowing up my phone won't make me leave no faster
Put my coat on faster, leave my girls no faster
I should've left my phone at home 'cause this is a disaster
Callin' like a collector, sorry, I cannot answer

[Verse 4: Lady Gaga & Beyoncé, both]
It's not that I don't like you, I'm just at a party
And I am sick and tired of my phone r-ringing
Sometimes I feel like I live in Grand Central Station
Tonight, I'm not taking no calls 'cause I'll be dancing
'Cause I'll be dancing, 'cause I'll be dancing
Tonight I'm not taking no calls, 'cause I'll be dancing

[Chorus: Lady Gaga]
Stop calling, stop calling, I don't wanna think anymore
I left my head and my heart on the dance floor
Stop calling, stop calling, I don't wanna talk anymore
I left my head and my heart on the dance floor
Stop calling, stop calling, I don't wanna think anymore
I left my head and my heart on the dance floor
Stop calling, stop calling, I don't wanna talk anymore
I left my head and my heart on the dance floor

[Post-Chorus: Lady Gaga & Beyoncé]
Eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh (Stop telephoning me)
Stop telephoning me!
Eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh (I'm busy)
I'm busy!
Eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh (Stop telephoning me)
Stop telephoning me!
Eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh (I'm busy)

[Refrain: Lady Gaga]
Can call all you want but there's no one home
And you're not gonna reach my telephone
'Cause I'm out in the club and I'm sipping that bubb
And you're not gonna reach my telephone
Can call all you want but there's no one home
And you're not gonna reach my telephone
'Cause I'm out in the club and I'm sipping that bubb
And you're not gonna reach my telephone

[Outro]
My telephone, m-m-my telephone
'Cause I'm out in the club, and I'm sipping that bubb
And you're not gonna reach my telephone
My telephone, m-m-my telephone
'Cause I'm out in the club, and I'm sipping that bubb
And you're not gonna reach my telephone
We're sorry
The number you have reached is not in service at this time
Please check the number or try your call again

[Verse 1]
Sometimes a story has no end
Sometimes I think that we could just be friends
"'Cause I'm a wandering man," he said to me
"And what about the future plans?
Does this thing we have even makes sense?
When I got the whole world in front of me?"
So, I said...

[Chorus 1]
I don't wanna be alone forever, but I can be tonight
I don't wanna be alone forever, but I love gypsy life
I don't wanna be alone forever
Maybe we can see the world together
I don't wanna be alone forever, but I can be
Tonight!
Tonight!

[Verse 2]
So I just packed my baggage, and
Said goodbye to family and friends
And took a road to nowhere on my own
Like Dorothy on a yellow brick
Hope my ruby shoes get us there quick
'Cause I left everyone I love at home

[Chorus 1]
I don't wanna be alone forever, but I can be tonight
I don't wanna be alone forever, but I love gypsy life
I don't wanna be alone forever
Maybe we can see the world together
I don't wanna be alone forever, but I can be
Tonight!
Tonight!

[Hook]
'Cause I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm a gypsy, gypsy, gypsy, I'm
I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm a gypsy, gypsy, gypsy, I'm
I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm a gypsy, gypsy, gypsy, I'm
I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm a gypsy, gypsy, gypsy, I'm

[Bridge]
And then he asked me, he said
"Baby, why do we love each other?"
I said, "Honey, it's simple
It's the way that you love and treat your mother."

[Chorus 2]
Thought that I would be alone forever, but I won't be tonight
I'm a man without a home, but I think with you, I could spend my life
And you'll be my little gypsy princess
Pack your bags and we can chase the sunset
Bust the rearview and fire up the jets
'Cause it's you and me
Baby, for life (if you go with me)
For life (see the world with me)

[Hook]
'Cause I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm a gypsy, gypsy, gypsy, I'm
I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm a gypsy, gypsy, gypsy, I'm

[Outro]
Russia, UK, Paris
I'm Italian, Asian kompai
Africa, India, I'm a gypsy, gypsy, gypsy
I'm Latin-American
I don't speak German, but I try
Someday in Jakarta
I'm American, I'm gypsy
I'm Bangkok, Australian, Malaysia
Sweden, Finland, Norway
Be my home just for the day
I'm a gypsy, gypsy, gypsy
Hey...

[Intro: Spoken]
It's like, I just love a cowboy
You know
I'm just like, I just, I know, it's bad
But I'm just like
Can I just like, hang off the back of your horse
And can you go a little faster?!

[Verse 1]
3 am, mustang speedin'
Two lovers, headed for a dead end
Too fast, hold tight, he laughs
Runnin' through the red lights
Hollerin' over, rubber spinnin'
Big swig, toss another beer can
Too lit, tonight, prayin'
On the moonlight

[Pre-Chorus]
Every John is just the same
I'm sick of their city games
I crave a real wild man
I'm strung out on John Wayne

[Chorus]

Baby let's get high, John Wayne
(dat - doo - deet - doe)

Baby let's get high, John Wayne

[Verse 2]
Blue collar and a red-state treasure
Love junkie on a three-day bender
His grip, so hard, eyes glare
Trouble like a mug shot
Charged up, 'cause the man's on a mission
1-2 ya, the gears are shiftin'
He called, I cried, we broke
Racin' through the moonlight

[Pre-Chorus]
Every John is just the same
I'm sick of their city games
I crave a real wild man
I'm strung out on John Wayne

[Chorus]

Baby let's get high, John Wayne

[Bridge]
So here I go
To the eye
Of the storm
Just to feel your love
Knock me over
Here I go
Into our love storm

[Chorus]
(dat - doo - deet - doe)
(dat - doo - deet - doe, dat - doo - deet - doe)
Baby let's get high, John Wayne
(dat - doo - deet - doe)
(dat - doo - deet - doe, dat - doo - deet - doe)
Baby let's get high, John Wayne

I know that we are young, and I know that you may love me
But I just can't be with you like this anymore
Alejandro...

[Verse 1]
She's got both hands in her pocket
And she won't look at you, won't look at you
She hides true love, en su bolsillo
She's got a halo around her finger, around you

[Pre-Chorus]
You know that I love you, boy
Hot, like Mexico, rejoice
At this point, I've gotta choose
Nothing to lose

But her boyfriend's like her dad, just like her dad
And all those flames that burned before him
Now he's gotta firefight, gotta cool the bad

[Pre-Chorus]
You know that I love you, boy
Hot, like Mexico, rejoice
At this point, I've gotta choose
Nothing to lose

[Chorus]
Don't call my name, don't call my name, Alejandro

[Verse 1]
Life is so simple
A little boy, a little girl
Laughing and loving
Tryin' to figure out the world
It felt like summer when I kissed you in the rain
And I know your story but tell me again

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Nothing you say wouldn't interest me
All of your words are like poems to me
I would be honored if you would take me as I am

[Chorus]
I want you
To look right in my eyes
To tell me you love me
To be by my side
I want you
At the end of my life
Wanna see your face
When I fall with grace
At the moment I die
Is that alright?
Is that alright?

[Verse 2]
I hope you’re still with me
When I’m not quite myself
And I pray that you’ll lift me
When you know I need help
It’s a warm celebration of all of our years
I dream of our story of our fairytale

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Family dinners and family trees
Teachin' the kids to say thank you and please
Knowing if we stay together that things will be right

[Chorus]
I want you
To look right in my eyes
To tell me you love me
To be by my side
I want you
At the end of my life
Wanna see your face
When I fall with grace
At the moment I die
Is that alright?
Is that alright?

[Outro]
Is that alright?

Here's to the ones that we got
Cheers to the wish you were here, but you're not
'Cause the drinks bring back all the memories
Of everything we've been through
Toast to the ones here today
Toast to the ones that we lost on the way
'Cause the drinks bring back all the memories
And the memories bring back, memories bring back you

[Verse 1]
There's a time that I remember, when I did not know no pain
When I believed in forever, and everything would stay the same
Now my heart feel like December when somebody say your name
'Cause I can't reach out to call you, but I know I will one day, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
Everybody hurts sometimes
Everybody hurts someday, ayy-ayy
But everything gon' be alright
Go and raise a glass and say, ayy

[Chorus]
Here's to the ones that we got
Cheers to the wish you were here, but you're not
'Cause the drinks bring back all the memories
Of everything we've been through
Toast to the ones here today
Toast to the ones that we lost on the way
'Cause the drinks bring back all the memories
And the memories bring back, memories bring back you

[Post-Chorus]
Doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo
Memories bring back, memories bring back you

[Verse 2]
There's a time that I remember when I never felt so lost
When I felt all of the hatred was too powerful to stop (Ooh, yeah)
Now my heart feel like an ember and it's lighting up the dark
I'll carry these torches for ya that you know I'll never drop, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
Everybody hurts sometimes
Everybody hurts someday, ayy-ayy
But everything gon' be alright
Go and raise a glass and say, ayy

[Chorus]
Here's to the ones that we got (Oh-oh)
Cheers to the wish you were here, but you're not
'Cause the drinks bring back all the memories
Of everything we've been through (No, no)
Toast to the ones here today (Ayy)
Toast to the ones that we lost on the way
'Cause the drinks bring back all the memories (Ayy)
And the memories bring back, memories bring back you

[Post-Chorus]
Doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo
Memories bring back, memories bring back you
Doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo (Ooh, yeah)
Memories bring back, memories bring back you

[Outro]
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, no, no
Memories bring back, memories bring back you

I don't wanna know, know, know, know
Who's taking you home, home, home, home

Wasted (Wasted)
And the more I drink, the more I think about you
Oh no, no, I can't take it
Baby, every place I go reminds me of you

[Pre-Chorus: Adam Levine]
Do you think of me? Of what we used to be?
Is it better now that I'm not around?
My friends are actin' strange, they don't bring up your name
Are you happy now?
Are you happy now?

[Verse 2: Adam Levine]
And every time I go out, yeah
I hear it from this one, I hear it from that one
That you got someone new
Yeah, I see but don't believe it
Even in my head, you're still in my bed
Maybe I'm just a fool

[Pre-Chorus: Adam Levine]
Do you think of me? Of what we used to be? (What we used to be)
Is it better now that I'm not around? (That I'm not around)
My friends are actin' strange, they don't bring up your name
Are you happy now?

[Chorus: Adam Levine]
I don't wanna know, know, know, know
Who's taking you home, home, home, home

[Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar]
No more “please stop”
No more hashtag boo'd up screenshots
No more tryin' make me jealous on your birthday
You know just how I made you better on your birthday, oh
Do he do you like this, do he woo you like this?
Do he lay it down for you, touch your poona like this?
Matter fact, never mind, we'll let the past be
May be his right now, but your body's still me, whoa

[Chorus: Adam Levine]
I don't wanna know, know, know, know
Who's taking you home, home, home, home
And loving you so, so, so, so

Spent 24 hours, I need more hours with you
You spent the weekend getting even, ooh
We spent the late nights making things right between us

[Pre-Chorus]
But now it's all good, babe
Roll that Backwood, babe
And play me close

[Chorus]
'Cause girls like you run 'round with guys like me
'Til sundown when I come through

Maybe you've taken my shit for the last time (yeah)
Maybe I know that I'm drunk
Maybe I know you're the one
Maybe you're thinking it's better if you drive

[Chorus]
Oh, 'cause girls like you run 'round with guys like me

[Intro]
Ooh, ooh ooh ooh, ooh ooh, ooh ooh
Ooh, ooh ooh ooh, ooh ooh, ooh ooh

[Verse 1]
You and I go hard at each other like we're going to war
You and I go rough, we keep throwing things and slamming the doors
You and I get so damn dysfunctional, we stopped keeping score
You and I get sick, yeah, I know that we can't do this no more

[Pre-Chorus]
Yeah but baby, there you go again, there you go again, making me love you
Yeah, I stopped using my head, using my head
Let it all go
Got you stuck on my body, on my body like a tattoo
And now I'm feeling stupid, feeling stupid crawling back to you

[Chorus]
So I cross my heart, and I hope to die
That I'll only stay with you one more night
And I know I've said it a million times
But I'll only stay with you one more night

[Verse 2]
Try to tell you "no", but my body keeps on telling you "yes"
Try to tell you "stop", but your lipstick got me so out of breath
I'll be waking up in the morning, probably hating myself
And I'll be waking up, feeling satisfied, but guilty as hell

[Pre-Chorus]
Yeah but baby, there you go again, there you go again, making me love you (Making me love you)
Yeah, I stopped using my head, using my head
Let it all go (Let it all go)
Got you stuck on my body, on my body like a tattoo (Like a tattoo, yeah)
And now I'm feeling stupid, feeling stupid crawling back to you

[Chorus]
So I cross my heart, and I hope to die (yeah)
That I'll only stay with you one more night (oh)
And I know I've said it a million times (yeah)
But I'll only stay with you one more night (yeah)

[Bridge]
(Ooh, ooh ooh ooh, ooh ooh, ooh ooh)
Yeah, baby, give me one more night
(Ooh, ooh ooh ooh, ooh ooh, ooh ooh)
Yeah, baby, give me one more night (whoa, yeah)
(Ooh, ooh ooh ooh, ooh ooh, ooh ooh)
Yeah, baby, give me one more night
Oh yeah yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
But baby, there you go again, there you go again, making me love you
Yeah, I stopped using my head, using my head
Let it all go
Got you stuck on my body, on my body like a tattoo, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Chorus]
So I cross my heart, and I hope to die
(Oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh)
That I'll only stay with you one more night
(Oh oh oh oh oh oh)
And I know I've said it a million times
(Oh, I've said it a million times)
But I'll only stay with you one more night
(Yeah, baby, give me one more night)
So I cross my heart and I hope to die (yeah, yeah)
That I'll only stay with you one more night (yeah, yeah)
And I know I've said it a million times (yeah, yeah)
But I'll only stay with you one more night (yeah, yeah)

[Chorus: Adam Levine]
I'm at a payphone, trying to call home
All of my change, I spent on you
Where have the times gone?
Baby, it's all wrong
Where are the plans we made for two?

[Verse 1: Adam Levine]
Yeah, I, I know it's hard to remember
The people we used to be
It's even harder to picture
That you're not here next to me
You say it's too late to make it
But is it too late to try?
And in our time that you wasted
All of our bridges burned down

[Pre-Chorus: Adam Levine]
I've wasted my nights
You turned out the lights
Now I'm paralyzed
Still stuck in that time when we called it love
But even the sun sets in paradise

[Chorus: Adam Levine]
I'm at a payphone, trying to call home
All of my change I spent on you
Where have the times gone? Baby, it's all wrong
Where are the plans we made for two?

[Post-Chorus: Adam Levine]
If "happy ever after" did exist
I would still be holding you like this
All those fairytales are full of shit
One more fucking love song, I'll be sick, oh

[Verse 2: Adam Levine]
You turned your back on tomorrow
'Cause you forgot yesterday
I gave you my love to borrow
But you just gave it away
You can't expect me to be fine
I don't expect you to care
I know I said it before
But all of our bridges burned down

[Pre-Chorus: Adam Levine]
I've wasted my nights
You turned out the lights
Now I'm paralyzed
Still stuck in that time when we called it love
But even the sun sets in paradise

[Chorus: Adam Levine]
I'm at a payphone, trying to call home
All of my change I spent on you (Whoa, whoa-oa)
Where have the times gone? Baby, it's all wrong
Where are the plans we made for two?

[Post-Chorus: Adam Levine]
If "happy ever after" did exist
I would still be holding you like this
And all those fairytales are full of shit
One more fucking love song, I'll be sick
Now, I'm at a payphone

[Verse 3: Wiz Khalifa]
Uh
Man, fuck that shit
I'll be out spending all this money
While you're sitting 'round wondering
Why it wasn't you who came up from nothing
Made it from the bottom
Now when you see me, I'm stuntin'
And all of my cars start with the push of a button
Telling me I changed since I blew up or whatever you call it
Switched the number to my phone so you never could call it
Don't need my name on my shirt, you can tell that I'm ballin'
Swish, what a shame, coulda got picked
Had a really good game, but you missed your last shot
So you talk about who you see at the top
Or what you could've saw, but sad to say it's over for
Phantom pulled up, valet open doors
Wished I'd go away, got what you was looking for
Now it's me who they want
So you can go take that little piece of shit with you

[Chorus: Adam Levine]
I'm at a payphone, trying to call home
All of my change I spent on you (Whoo!)
Where have the times gone? Baby, it's all wrong
Where are the plans we made for two? (For two?)

[Post-Chorus: Adam Levine]
If "happy ever after" did exist
I would still be holding you like this
And all these fairytales are full of shit
One more fucking love song, I'll be sick
Now, I'm at a payphone

[Chorus: Adam Levine]
Cold enough to chill my bones
It feels like I don't know you anymore
I don't understand why you're so cold to me
With every breath you breathe
I see there's something going on
I don't understand why you're so cold

[Verse 1: Adam Levine]
Are we taking time or a time out?
I can't take the in-between
Asking me for space here in my house
You know how to fuck with me
Acting like we're not together
After everything that we've been through
Sleeping up under the covers
How am I so far away from you?

[Pre-Chorus: Adam Levine]
Distant, when we're kissing
Feel so different
Baby, tell me how did you get so

[Chorus: Adam Levine]
Cold enough to chill my bones
It feels like I don't know you anymore
I don't understand why you're so cold to me
With every breath you breathe
I see there's something going on
I don't understand why you're so cold, yeah

[Post-Chorus: Adam Levine]
Whoa, yeah
Whoa, yeah
I don't understand why you're so cold

[Verse 2: Adam Levine]
What you holdin' on, holdin' on for?
If you wanna leave, just leave
Why you wanna bite your tongue for?
The silence is killing me
Acting like we're not together
If you don't want this, then what's the use?
Sleeping up under the covers
How am I so far away from you?

[Pre-Chorus: Adam Levine]
Distant (Oh), when we're kissing (Yeah)
Feel so different (Yeah)
Baby tell me how did you get so

[Chorus: Adam Levine]
Cold enough to chill my bones
It feels like I don't know you anymore
I don't understand why you're so cold to me
With every breath you breathe
I see there's something going on
I don't understand why you're so cold, yeah

[Post-Chorus: Adam Levine & Future]
Whoa, yeah
Whoa, yeah
I don't understand why you're so cold, yeah
So tough, it’s a cold world
Whoa, yeah
So tough, it’s a cold world
Whoa, yeah
So tough, it’s a cold world
I don't understand why you're so cold

[Verse 3: Future & Adam Levine]
Never thought that you were like this
I took the tag off, and made you priceless
I just spent half a mill' on a chandelier
Now you tryna cut me off like a light switch, yeah
Tryna stay in our league
Saying that you need some time to breathe
Thinking that I'm sleeping on the four-letter word
But the four-letter word don't sleep
We goin' two separate ways
You ain't been actin' the same
You gotta go, girl, where your heart used to be
You gold-dig every day
I switched the four-door to the two-door
'Cause I can't let my driver hear what you say
Girl, I tried to give you space
Baby, tell me how did you get so cold

[Chorus: Adam Levine]
Cold enough to chill my bones
It feels like I don't know you anymore
I don't understand why you're so cold to me
With every breath you breathe
I see there's something going on
I don't understand why you're so cold

[Post-Chorus: Adam Levine & Future]
So tough, it’s a cold world
Whoa, yeah
So tough, it’s a cold world
Whoa, yeah
So tough, it’s a cold world
I don't understand why you're so cold, yeah
So tough, it’s a cold world
Whoa, yeah
So tough, it’s a cold world
Whoa, yeah
So tough, it’s a cold world
I don't understand why you're so cold

[Verse 1]
Beauty queen of only eighteen
She had some trouble with herself
He was always there to help her
She always belonged to someone else
I drove for miles and miles
And wound up at your door
I've had you so many times
But somehow, I want more

[Chorus]
I don't mind spending every day
Out on your corner in the pouring rain
Look for the girl with the broken smile
Ask her if she wants to stay a while
And she will be loved
And she will be loved

[Verse 2]
Tap on my window, knock on my door
I want to make you feel beautiful
I know I tend to get so insecure
Doesn't matter anymore
It's not always rainbows and butterflies
It's compromise that moves us along, yeah
My heart is full and my door's always open
You come any time you want, yeah

[Chorus]
I don't mind spending every day
Out on your corner in the pouring rain
Look for the girl with the broken smile
Ask her if she wants to stay a while
And she will be loved
And she will be loved
And she will be loved
And she will be loved

[Bridge]
I know where you hide
Alone in your car
Know all of the things that make you who you are
I know that goodbye means nothing at all
Comes back and makes me catch her every time she falls, yeah
Tap on my window, knock on my door
I want to make you feel beautiful

[Chorus]
I don't mind spending every day
Out on your corner in the pouring rain, oh
Look for the girl with the broken smile
Ask her if she wants to stay a while
And she will be loved
And she will be loved
And she will be loved
And she will be loved

[Outro fading out]
I don't mind spending every day
Out on your corner in the pouring rain
Please don't try so hard to say goodbye

[Verse 1]
Dirty looks from your mother
Never seen you in a dress that color, no
It's a special occasion
Not invited, but I'm glad I made it, oh

[Pre-Chorus]
Let me apologize
I'll make up, make up, make up, make up for all those times (all those times)
Your love, I don't wanna lose
I'm beggin', beggin', beggin', beggin', I'm beggin' you

[Chorus]
Wait, can you turn around, can you turn around?
Just wait, can we work this out, can we work this out?
Just wait, can you come here please? 'Cause I wanna be with you
Wait, can you turn around, can you turn around?
Just wait, can we work this out, can we work this out?
Just wait, could you come here please? 'Cause I wanna be with you

[Verse 2]
Can we talk for a moment?
Got these feelings that I'm tired of holdin' on
Wasn't tryna get wasted
I needed more than three or four to say this, oh

[Pre-Chorus]
Let me apologize, yeah
I'll make up, make up, make up, make up for all those times (all those times)
Your love, I don't wanna lose (lose)
I'm beggin', beggin', beggin', beggin', I'm begging you

[Chorus]
Wait, can you turn around, can you turn around? (no)
Just wait, can we work this out, can we work this out? (Just wait)
Just wait, can you come here please? 'Cause I wanna be with you
Wait, can you turn around, can you turn around?
Just wait, can we work this out, can we work this out? (Just wait)
Just wait, could you come here please?(yeah) 'Cause I wanna be with you

[Bridge]
You say I'm just another bad guy
You say I've done a lot of things I can't undo
Before you tell me for the last time, yeah
I'm beggin', beggin', beggin', beggin', beggin' you

[Chorus]
Wait, can you turn around, can you turn around?
Just wait, can we work this out, can we work this out? (Can we work this out)
Just wait, can you come here please? 'Cause I wanna be with you ( I wanna be with you)
Wait, can you turn around, can you turn around?(yea)
Just wait, can we work this out, can we work this out?
Just wait, could you come here please? 'Cause I wanna be with you

[Verse 1]
I'm hurting baby, I'm broken down
I need your loving, loving I need it now
When I'm without you, I'm something weak
You got me begging, begging I'm on my knees

[Pre-Chorus]
I don't wanna be needing your love
I just wanna be deep in your love
And it's killing me when you're away
Ooh baby
'Cause I really don't care where you are
I just wanna be there where you are
And I gotta get one little taste

[Chorus]
Sugar, yes please
Won't you come and put it down on me?
I'm right here, 'cause I need
Little love, a little sympathy
Yeah, you show me good loving, make it alright
Need a little sweetness in my life
Your sugar, yes please
Won't you come and put it down on me?

[Verse 2]
Babe, my broken pieces, you pick them up
Don't leave me hanging, hanging
Come give me some
When I'm without you, I'm so insecure
You are the one thing, one thing I'm living for

[Pre-Chorus]
I don't wanna be needing your love
I just wanna be deep in your love
And it's killing me when you're away
Ooh baby
'Cause I really don't care where you are

Your sugar, yes please (Your sugar, yes please)
Won't you come and put it down on me?

[Bridge]
Yeah
I want that red velvet
I want that sugar sweet
Don't let nobody touch it unless that somebody's me
I gotta be a man, there ain't no other way
'Cause girl you're hotter than a Southern California day
Never wanna play no games, you don't gotta  be afraid
Don't give me all that shy shit
No makeup on, that's my sugar

[Chorus]
Sugar, yes please (Please)
Won't you come and put it down on me? (Down on me)

Won't you come and put it down on me?
(Down on me, down on me, ooh)

[Verse 1]
I miss the taste of a sweeter life
I miss the conversation
I'm searching for a song tonight
I'm changing all of the stations
I like to think that we had it all
We drew a map to a better place
But on that road I took a fall
Oh, baby, why did you run away?

[Pre-Chorus]
I was there for you
In your darkest times
I was there for you
In your darkest night

[Chorus]
But I wonder, where were you?
When I was at my worst
Down on my knees
And you said you had my back
So I wonder, where were you?
All the roads you took came back to me
So I'm following the map that leads to you

[Post-Chorus]
The map that leads to you
Ain't nothing I can do
The map that leads to you
Following, following, following to you
The map that leads to you
Ain't nothing I can do
The map that leads to you
Following, following, following

[Verse 2]
I hear your voice in my sleep at night
Hard to resist temptation
'Cause something strange has come over me
Now, I can't get over you
No, I just can't get over you

[Pre-Chorus]
I was there for you
In your darkest times
I was there for you
In your darkest night

[Chorus]
But I wonder, where were you?
When I was at my worst
Down on my knees
And you said you had my back
So I wonder, where were you?
All the roads you took came back to me
So I'm following the map that leads to you

[Post-Chorus]
The map that leads to you
Ain't nothing I can do
The map that leads to you
Following, following, following to you
The map that leads to you
Ain't nothing I can do
The map that leads to you

[Bridge]
Oh, oh, oh, ah
Ooh, oh, oh, ah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, ah
Aha, ah, mmm, ah
Oh, I was there for you
Oh, in your darkest times
Oh, I was there for you
Oh, in your darkest night
Oh, I was there for you
Oh, in your darkest times
Oh, I was there for you
Oh, in your darkest night

[Chorus]
But I wonder, where were you?
When I was at my worst
Down on my knees
And you said you had my back
So I wonder, where were you?
All the roads you took came back to me
So I'm following the map that leads to you
The map that leads to you
Ain't nothing I can do
The map that leads to you
Following, following, following to you
The map that leads to you
Ain't nothing I can do
The map that leads to you
Following, following, following

[Chorus]
Baby, I'm preying on you tonight
Hunt you down, eat you alive
Just like animals, animals, like animals-mals
Maybe you think that you can hide
I can smell your scent from miles
Just like animals, animals, like animals-mals
Baby, I'm... (Hey)

[Verse 1]
So what you trying to do to me? (Hey)
It's like we can't stop, we're enemies (Hey)
But we get along when I'm inside you, yeah (Hey)
You're like a drug that's killing me (Hey)
I cut you out entirely (Hey)
But I get so high when I'm inside you

[Pre-Chorus]
Yeah, you can start over, you can run free (Hey)
You can find other fish in the sea (Hey)
You can pretend it's meant to be (Hey)
But you can't stay away from me
I can still hear you making that sound (Hey)
Taking me down, rolling on the ground (Hey)
You can pretend that it was me, but no, oh (Hey)

[Chorus]
Baby, I'm preying on you tonight
Hunt you down, eat you alive
Just like animals, animals, like animals-mals
Maybe you think that you can hide
I can smell your scent from miles
Just like animals, animals, like animals-mals
Baby, I'm... (Hey)

[Verse 2]
So if I run, it's not enough (Hey)
You're still in my head, forever stuck (Hey)
So you can do what you wanna do, yeah (Hey)
I love your lies, I'll eat 'em up (Hey)
But don't deny the animal (Hey)
That comes alive when I'm inside you

[Pre-Chorus]
Yeah, you can start over, you can run free (Hey)
You can find other fish in the sea (Hey)
You can pretend it's meant to be
But you can't stay away from me
I can still hear you making that sound (Hey)
Taking me down, rolling on the ground (Hey)
You can pretend that it was me, but no, oh (Hey)

[Chorus]
Baby, I'm preying on you tonight
Hunt you down, eat you alive
Just like animals, animals, like animals-mals
Maybe you think that you can hide
I can smell your scent from miles
Just like animals, animals, like animals-mals
Baby, I'm...

[Bridge]
Don't tell no lie, lie, lie, lie
You can't deny-ny-ny-ny
The beast inside, si-si-side
Yeah, yeah, yeah
No girl don't lie, lie, lie, lie (No, no, don't lie)
You can't deny-ny-ny-ny (You can't deny)
The beast inside, si-si-side
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yo-oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Just like animals, animals, like animals-mals (Hey, hey)
Just like animals, animals, like animals-mals, oww!
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)

[Chorus]
Baby, I'm preying on you tonight
Hunt you down, eat you alive
Just like animals, animals, like animals-mals
Maybe you think that you can hide
I can smell your scent from miles
Just like animals, animals, like animals-mals
Baby, I'm...

[Outro]
Don't tell no lie, lie, lie, lie
You can't deny-ny-ny-ny
The beast inside, si-si-side
Yeah, yeah, yeah
No girl don't lie, lie, lie, lie (No, no, don't lie)
You can't deny-ny-ny-ny (You can't deny)
The beast inside, si-si-side
Yeah, yeah, yeah

[Intro]
Yeah

[Verse 1]
Sunday morning, rain is falling
Steal some covers, share some skin (Like that)
Clouds are shrouding us in moments unforgettable
You twist to fit the mold that I am in

[Refrain]
But things just get so crazy, living life gets hard to do
And I would gladly hit the road, get up and go if I knew
That someday, it would lead me back to you
That someday, it would lead me back to you (Someday)

[Chorus]
That may be all I need
In darkness, she is all I see
Come and rest your bones with me
Driving slow on Sunday morning
And I never want to leave

[Verse 2]
Fingers trace your every outline
Paint a picture with my hands
Back and forth, we sway like branches in a storm
Change the weather, still together when it ends

[Chorus]
That may be all I need
In darkness, she is all I see
Come and rest your bones with me
Driving slow on Sunday morning
And I never want to leave

[Refrain]
Oh yeah, but things just get so crazy, living life gets hard to do
Sunday morning, rain is falling and I'm calling out to you
Singing, someday it'll bring me back to you (Oh yeah, oh yeah)
Find a way to bring myself back home to you

[Chorus]
And you may not know
That may be all I need
In darkness, she is all I see (You are all I see)
Come and rest your bones with me
Driving slow on Sunday morning
Driving slow, ooh, yeah, yeah...

[Outro]
It's a flower in your hair
I'm a flower in your hair

[Verse 1]
I was so high I did not recognize
The fire burning in her eyes
The chaos that controlled my mind
Whispered goodbye as she got on a plane
Never to return again
But always in my heart

[Chorus]
This love has taken its toll on me
She said goodbye too many times before
And her heart is breaking in front of me
And I have no choice, 'cause I won't say goodbye anymore

[Verse 2]
I tried my best to feed her appetite
Keep her coming every night
So hard to keep her satisfied
Keep playing love like it was just a game
Pretending to feel the same
Then turn around and leave again

[Chorus]
This love has taken its toll on me
She said goodbye too many times before
And her heart is breaking in front of me
And I have no choice, 'cause I won't say goodbye anymore

[Bridge]
I'll fix these broken things
Repair your broken wings
And make sure everything's alright (It's alright, it's alright)
My pressure on your hips
Sinking my fingertips
Into every inch of you
'Cause I know that's what you want me to do

[Chorus]
This love has taken its toll on me
She said goodbye too many times before
And her heart is breaking in front of me
And I have no choice, 'cause I won't say goodbye anymore
This love has taken its toll on me
She said goodbye too many times before
And my heart is breaking in front of me
She said goodbye too many times before
This love has taken its toll on me
She said goodbye too many times before
And her heart is breaking in front of me
I have no choice, 'cause I won't say goodbye anymore

[Verse 1: Adam Levine]
Oh
Oh

[Verse 1: Adam Levine]
Just shoot for the stars
If it feels right, then aim for my heart
If you feel like
And take me away
And make it okay
I swear I'll behave
You wanted control, so we waited
I put on a show, now I'm naked
You say I'm a kid
My ego is big
I don't give a shit
And it goes like this, uh

[Chorus: Adam Levine]
Take me by the tongue and I'll know you (Uh)
Kiss me till you're drunk and I'll show you
You want the moves like Jagger
I've got them moves like Jagger
I've got them moves like Jagger (Uh)
I don't needa try to control you (Uh)
Look into my eyes and I'll own you
With them moves like Jagger
I've got them moves like Jagger
I've got them moves like Jagger

[Verse 2: Adam Levine]
Baby, it's hard, when you feel like
You're broken and scarred, nothing feels right
But when you're with me
I'll make you believe
That I've got the key
Oh, so get in the car, we can ride it
Wherever you want, get inside it
And you wanna steer, but I'm shifting gears
I'll take it from here (Oh, yeah, yeah)
And it goes like this, uh

[Chorus: Adam Levine & (Christina Aguilera)]
Take me by the tongue and I'll know you (Uh)
Kiss me till you're drunk and I'll show you
You want the moves like Jagger
I've got them moves like Jagger
I've got them moves like Jagger (Uh)
I don't need to try to control you (Oh yeah)
Look into my eyes and I'll own you
With them moves like Jagger
I've got them moves like Jagger (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
I've got them moves like Jagger

[Bridge: Christina Aguilera & Adam Levine]
Uh, you wanna know, how to make me smile?
Take control, own me just for the night
And if I share my secret
You're gonna have to keep it
Nobody else can see this (Uh)
So watch and learn, I won't show you twice
Head to toe, ooh baby, rub me right
And if I share my secret
You're gonna have to keep it
Nobody else can see this
Hey, hey, hey, yeah
And it goes like this, uh

[Chorus: Adam Levine & Christina Aguilera]
Take me by the tongue and I'll know you (Take me by the tongue)
Kiss me till you're drunk and I'll show you (Yeah, yeah)
You want the moves like Jagger
I've got the moves like Jagger
I've got the moves like Jagger (Oh yeah)
I don't needa try to control you (Ooh)
Look into my eyes and I'll own you (Ooh)
With them moves like Jagger
I've got them moves like Jagger
I've got them moves like Jagger

[Chorus: Adam Levine]
Leaves are fallin', it's September
The night came in, it made her shiver
I told her she could have my jacket
Wrapped it tight around her shoulders
And I was so young 'til she kissed me
Like a whiskey, like a whiskey

[Verse 1: Adam Levine]
I never knew that love was blind
'Til I was hers, but she was never mine
Yeah, I was reckless
But I let it burn, I let it burn, yeah
The feelin', it was bittersweet
Realizin' I was in too deep
She was a lesson
I had to learn, I had to learn, yeah

[Pre-Chorus: Adam Levine]
I used to try to forget her
But now I smile when I remember
Ooh

[Chorus: Adam Levine]
Leaves are fallin' in September
The night came in, it made her shiver
I told her she could have my jacket
Wrapped it tight around her shoulders
And I was so young 'til she kissed me
Like a whiskey, like a whiskey
Ooh, like a whiskey, ooh

[Verse 2: Adam Levine]
Would've left this world behind
Just to wake up by your side
Every mornin', I would've sold my soul for a lil' more time
Would've waited a thousand nights
If she never said goodbye
I admit that I
Would've sold my soul for a little more time
Ooh

[Pre-Chorus: Adam Levine]
I used to try to forget her
But now I smile when I remember

[Chorus: Adam Levine]
Leaves are fallin', it's September
The night came in, it made her shiver
I told her she could have my jacket
Wrapped it tight around her shoulders
And I was so young 'til she kissed me
Like a whiskey, like a whiskey

[Verse 3: A$AP Rocky]
I ain't like the other Cognacs
Or type of cat that'd never call back
Or lose contact when you runnin' out of rum and you make a run
(Feelin' light and dizzy, might be tipsy)
All of that tequila's a killer, little vodka
Break her off somethin' proper
Pop a cork and play spin the bottle
(Every time you kiss me, like some whiskey)
Punch drunk love, it's a fine line
Dom Pérignon, she the fine wine
Someone call 911, I'm runnin' out of time
She done got off with my heart

[Chorus: Adam Levine & (A$AP Rocky)]
Leaves are fallin', it's September (oh)
The night came in, it made her shiver
I told her she could have my jacket
Wrapped it tight around her shoulders
And I was so young (so young)
'Til she kissed me (yeah)
Like a whiskey (yeah)
And I was so young (so young)
'Til she kissed me
Like a whiskey, like a whiskey

[Verse 1]
You keep me connected to you like I was your shadow
You're giving me answers to all of my questions here on my pillow, oh
Can't nothing get in between us, baby
We've been waiting on this moment for so long
You wanna be reckless, restless, right until tomorrow
Wait

[Chorus]
When I put my lips on you
You feel the shivers go up and down your spine for me
Make you cry for me
When I put my lips on you
I hear your voice echoing all through the night for me
Baby, cry for me
When I put my lips on you (when I, when I, when I)
When I put my lips on you (when I, when I, when I)

[Verse 2]
Just turn off the lights and you can be my private dancer
When we close the curtains
You and me can forget all our manners, oh
The neighbors must think that we're crazy, baby
'Cause look how easily we keep coming undone
You wanna be reckless, restless, right until tomorrow
Wait

[Chorus]
When I put my lips on you
You feel the shivers go up and down your spine for me
Make you cry for me
When I put my lips on you
I hear your voice echoing all through the night for me
Baby, cry for me
When I put my lips on you (when I, when I, when I)
When I put my lips on you (when I, when I, when I)
When I put my lips on you (when I, when I, when I)
When I put my lips on you (when I, when I, when I)

[Chorus]
When I put my lips on you
You feel the shivers go up and down your spine for me
Make you cry for me
When I put my lips on you
I hear your voice echoing all through the night for me
Baby, cry for me
Baby, when I put my lips on you (when I, when I, when I)
When I put my lips on you (when I, when I, when I)
When I put my lips on you (when I, when I, when I)
When I put my lips on you (when I, when I, when I)

[Verse 1]
Here I am waiting
I'll have to leave soon
Why am I holding on?
We knew this day would come
We knew it all along
How did it come so fast?

[Pre-Chorus]
This is our last night, but it's late
And I'm trying not to sleep
'Cause I know, when I wake
I will have to slip away

[Chorus]
And when the daylight comes, I'll have to go
But tonight I'm gonna hold you so close
'Cause in the daylight, we'll be on our own
But tonight I need to hold you so close
Ooh-whoa, ooh-whoa, ooh-whoa
Ooh-whoa, ooh-whoa, ooh-whoa

[Verse 2]
Here I am staring at your perfection
In my arms, so beautiful
The sky is getting bright
The stars are burning out
Somebody slow it down

[Pre-Chorus 2]
This is way too hard
'Cause I know, when the sun comes up
I will leave, this is my last glance
That will soon be memory

[Chorus]
And when the daylight comes, I'll have to go
But tonight I'm gonna hold you so close
'Cause in the daylight, we'll be on our own
But tonight, I need to hold you so close
Ooh-whoa, ooh-whoa, ooh-whoa
Ooh-whoa, ooh-whoa, ooh-whoa

[Bridge]
I never want it to stop
Because I don't wanna start all over, start all over
I was afraid of the dark
But now it's all that I want, all that I want, all that I want

[Chorus]
And when the daylight comes, I'll have to go
But tonight I'm gonna hold you so close
'Cause in the daylight, we'll be on our own
But tonight I need to hold you so close
And when the daylight comes I'll have to go
But tonight I'm gonna hold you so close
'Cause in the daylight, we'll be on our own
But tonight I need to hold you so close
Ooh-whoa, ooh-whoa, ooh-whoa
Ooh-whoa, ooh-whoa, ooh-whoa

[Outro]
Ooh-whoa (Yeah), ooh-whoa (Yeah), ooh-whoa (Yeah, yeah)
Ooh-whoa (Yeah), ooh-whoa (Yeah), ooh-whoa

[Chorus]
This summer's gonna hurt like a motherfucker, fucker
This summer's gonna hurt like a motherfucker, fucker

[Verse 1]
Her body's hot
Her body's like the summer
I'm in a trance or something
Her mind is not, no
As sharp as all her diamonds
She must be smoking something

[Pre-Chorus]
I see her dancing in the streets
Sipping champagne on the beach
So expensive when she eats
'Cause she's so fancy
I see her when I go to sleep
I check my phone when I am weak
She never posts anything deep
'Cause she's so fancy

[Chorus]
This summer's gonna hurt like a motherfucker, fucker
This summer's gonna hurt like a motherfucker, fucker

[Verse 2]
She wants it all
She's always taking something
And now I'm left with nothing
I'm ripping off, oh
I'm ripping off that bandage
Because I just can't stand it

[Pre-Chorus]
I see her dancing on a fool
Like she's seventeen and cool
She really thinks that she can move
But it's just nasty
I see her when I go to sleep
I check my phone when I am weak
She never posts anything deep
'Cause she's so fancy

[Chorus]
This summer's gonna hurt like a motherfucker, fucker
This summer's gonna hurt like a motherfucker, fucker

[Bridge]
Has to have it all, chases every star, she's so popular (Whoo!)
Has to have it all, chases every star, she's so popular, oh
This summer's gonna hurt, it's gonna hurt
I see her dancing in the street
Sipping champagne on the beach
So expensive when she eats
'Cause she's so fancy
'Cause she's so fancy

[Chorus]
This summer's gonna hurt like a motherfucker, fucker
This summer's gonna hurt like a motherfucker, fucker
This summer's gonna hurt like a motherfucker, fucker
This summer's gonna hurt like a motherfucker, fucker
This summer's gonna hurt like a motherfucker

[Verse 1]
I know your insides are feeling so hollow
And it's a hard pill for you to swallow, yeah
But if I fall for you, I'll never recover
If I fall for you, I'll never be the same

[Chorus]
I really wanna love somebody
I really wanna dance the night away
I know we're only half way there
But you take me all the way, you take me all the way
I really wanna touch somebody
I think about you every single day
I know we're only half way there
But you take me all the way, you take me all the way

[Verse 2]
You're such a hard act for me to follow
Love me today, don't leave me tomorrow, yeah
But if I fall for you, I'll never recover
If I fall for you, I'll never be the same

[Chorus]
I really wanna love somebody
I really wanna dance the night away
I know we're only half way there
But you take me all the way, you take me all the way
I really wanna touch somebody
I think about you every single day
I know we're only half way there
But you take me all the way, you take me all the way

[Break]
Oh, oh, oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh-oh-oh

[Bridge]
I don't know where to start, I'm just a little lost
I wanna feel like we're never gonna ever stop
I don't know what to do, I'm right in front of you
Asking you to stay, you should stay, stay with me tonight, yeah

[Chorus]
I really wanna love somebody
I really wanna dance the night away
I know we're only half way there
But you take me all the way, you take me all the way
I really wanna touch somebody
I think about you every single day
I know we're only half way there
But you take me all the way, you take me all the way

[Break]
Oh, oh, oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh-oh-oh

[Outro]
You take me all the way, you take me all the way, yeah

Havana, ooh na-na

[Verse 1]
Somethin' must've gone wrong in my brain
Got your chemicals all in my veins
Feelin' all the highs, feelin' all the pain
Let go of the wheel, that's the bullet lane
Now I'm seein' red, not thinkin' straight
Blurrin' all the lines, you intoxicate me

[Pre-Chorus]
Just like nicotine, heroin, morphine
Suddenly, I'm a fiend and you're all I need
All I need, yeah, you're all I need

[Chorus]
It's you, babe
And I'm a sucker for the way that you move, babe
And I could try to run, but it would be useless
You're to blame
Just one hit of you, I knew I'll never be the same
It's you, babe
And I'm a sucker for the way that you move, babe
And I could try to run, but it would be useless
You're to blame
Just one hit of you, I knew I'll never ever, ever be the same

[Post-Chorus]
I'll never be the same
I'll never be the same
I'll never be the same

[Verse 2]
Sneakin' in L.A. when the lights are low
Off of one touch, I could overdose
You said, "Stop playin' it safe
Girl, I wanna see you lose control"

[Pre-Chorus]
Just like nicotine, heroin, morphine
Suddenly, I'm a fiend and you're all I need
All I need, yeah, you're all I need

[Chorus]
It's you, babe
And I'm a sucker for the way that you move, babe
And I could try to run, but it would be useless
You're to blame
Just one hit of you, I knew I'll never be the same
It's you, babe
And I'm a sucker for the way that you move, babe
And I could try to run, but it would be useless
You're to blame
Just one hit of you, I knew I'll never ever, ever be the same

[Post-Chorus]
I'll never be the same
I'll never be the same
I'll never be the same

[Bridge]
You're in my blood, you're in my veins, you're in my head (I blame)
You're in my blood, you're in my veins, you're in my head (I'm sayin')

[Chorus]
I'm sayin' it's you, babe
And I'm a sucker for the way that you move, babe
And I could try to run, but it would be useless
You're to blame (You're to blame)
Just one hit of you, I knew I'll never be the same (I'll never be the...)
It's you, babe
And I'm a sucker for the way that you move, babe
And I could try to run, but it would be useless
You're to blame
Just one hit of you, I knew I'll never ever, ever be the same

[Verse 1]
You think that you'll die without him
You know, that's a lie that you tell yourself
You fear that you lay alone forever now
It ain't true, ain't true, ain't true, no

[Pre-Chorus]
So put your arms around me tonight
Let the music lift you up
Like you've never been so high
Open up your heart to me
Let the music lift you up
Like you've never been this free
'Til you feel the sunrise
Let the music warm your body
Like the heat of a thousand fires
The heat of a thousand fires

[Chorus]
Ain't no crying in the club (hey, hey)
Let the beat carry away, your tears as they fall, baby
Ain't no crying in the club (hey, hey)
With a little faith, your tears turn to ecstasy
Ain't no crying in the club
I won't, I won't, I...
Ain't no crying in the club
I won't, I won't, I...
Ain't no crying in the club

[Verse 2]
You may think that you'll die without her
But you know, that's a lie that you told yourself
You fear that you'll never meet another so pure
It ain't true, ain't true, ain't true, no

[Pre-Chorus]
So put your arms around me tonight
Let the music lift you up
Like you've never been so high
Open up your heart to me
Let the music lift you up
Like you've never been this free
'Til you feel the sunrise
Let the music warm your body
Like the heat of a thousand fires
The heat of a thousand fires

[Chorus]
Ain't no crying in the club (hey, hey)
Let the beat carry away, your tears as they fall, baby
Ain't no crying in the club (hey, hey)
With a little faith, your tears turn to ecstasy
Ain't no crying in the club
I won't, I won't, I...
Ain't no crying in the club
I won't, I won't, I...
Ain't no crying in the club

[Bridge]
You think that you'll die without him
You know, that's a lie that you tell yourself
You fear that you lay alone forever now
It ain't true, ain't true, ain't true
I said ain't no... (ain't no...)
Ain't no crying...
Ain't no crying in the club, no crying...
I said ain't no... (ain't no...)
Ain't no crying...
Ain't no crying in the club, no crying...
Woah!

[Chorus]
Ain't no crying in the club (hey, hey)
Let the beat carry away, your tears as they fall, baby
Ain't no crying in the club (hey, hey)
With a little faith, your tears turn to ecstasy
Ain't no crying in the club
I won't, I won't, I...
Ain't no crying in the club
I won't, I won't, I...
Ain't no crying in the club (I won't cry, I won't cry, I won't cry no more)
I won't, I won't, I...
Ain't no crying in the club (I won't cry, I won't cry, I won't cry no more)
I won't, I won't, I...
Ain't no crying in the club

[Verse 1]
No, I think I'll stay in tonight
Skip the conversations and the "Oh, I'm fine's"
No, I'm no stranger to surprise
This paper town has let me down too many times
Why do I even try?
Give me a reason why
I thought that I could trust you, never mind
Why all the switching sides?
Where do I draw the line?
I guess I'm too naive to read the signs

[Chorus]
I'm just lookin' for some real friends
All they ever do is let me down
Every time I let somebody in
Then I find out what they're all about
I'm just lookin' for some real friends
Wonder where they're all hidin' out
I'm just lookin' for some real friends
Gotta get up out of this town (oh, ooh)

[Post-Chorus]
Oh, yeah

[Verse 2]
I stay up, talkin' to the moon (ooh)
Been feelin' so alone in every crowded room
Can't help but feel like something's wrong, yeah
'Cause the place I'm livin' in
Just doesn't feel like home

[Chorus]
I'm just lookin' for some real friends
All they ever do is let me down
Every time I let somebody in
Then I find out what they're all about
I'm just lookin' for some real friends
Wonder where they're all hidin' out
I'm just lookin' for some real friends
Gotta get up out of this town

[Post-Chorus]
Oh
Lookin' for some real friends
Oh, oh-oh

[Bridge]
I just wanna talk about nothin'
With somebody that means something
Spell the names of all the dreams and demons
For the times that I don't understand
Tell me, what's the point of a moon like this
When I'm alone again?
Can I run away to somewhere beautiful
Where nobody knows my name?

[Chorus]
I'm just lookin' for some real friends
All they ever do is let me down
Then, I let somebody in
But I find out what they're all about
I'm just lookin' for some real friends
All they ever do is let me down
I'm just lookin' for some real friends
Gotta get up out of this town, yeah

[Post-Chorus]
Oh (ah)
Oh, yeah, ah

[Chorus: Camila Cabello]
They say he likes a good time (My oh my)
He comes alive at midnight (Every night)
My mama doesn't trust him (My oh my)
He's only here for one thing, but (So am I)

[Verse 1: Camila Cabello]
Yeah, a little bit older, a black leather jacket
A bad reputation, insatiable habits
He was onto me, one look and I couldn't breathe, yeah
I said, if he kissed me, I might let it happen (Oh)

[Pre-Chorus: Camila Cabello]
I swear on my life that I've been a good girl (Oh)
Tonight, I don't wanna be her

[Chorus: Camila Cabello & DaBaby]
They say he likes a good time (My oh my)
He comes alive at midnight (Every night)
My mama doesn't trust him (My oh my)
He's only here for one thing, but (Let's go, so am I)

[Verse 2: DaBaby & Camila Cabello]
Look, I'm the type to make her turn on her daddy (Oh yeah)
DaBaby make her forget what she learned from her daddy
I don't be tripping on lil' shawty, I let her do whatever she please
I don't be kissing on lil' shawty, she don't be kissing on me either
She came with you, then left with me
I went up a point, let's call it even (Yeah, yeah)
Don't like the car she in, gon' end up buyin' her a new Bimmer (Let's go)
That girl know what she want, she make me take it off when she see me (Let's go)
She say I make her wet whenever my face pop up on TV
I had to say, "No disrespect, gotta do it safe or you can keep it"
Pop star, I'm fresh up out the trap and I'm going Bieber
She know I'm a call away, she can drop a pin and I'd come meet her
Stand next to me, you gon' end up catchin' a fever (Yeah, yeah)
I'm hot

[Pre-Chorus: Camila Cabello]
I swear on my life that I've been a good girl (Good girl, good girl)
Tonight, I don't wanna be her

[Chorus: Camila Cabello]
They say he likes a good time (My oh my)
He comes alive at midnight (Every time)
(He comes alive, oh every night)
My mama doesn't trust him (My oh my)
He's only here for one thing, but (So am I)

[Bridge: Camila Cabello]
My, my, my, my, my oh my
My mama doesn't trust you, baby
My, my, my, my, my oh my
And my daddy doesn't know you, no
My, my, my, my, my oh my (Oh my, my, my, my, my)
My, my, my, my, my oh my (My, my, my, ooh)

[Chorus: Camila Cabello]
They say he likes a good time (My oh my)
He comes alive at midnight (Every night)
My mama doesn't trust him (My oh my)
He's only here for one thing, but (So am I)

[Verse 1]
Don't speak, no, don't try
It's been a secret for the longest time
Don't run (Oh), no, don't hide
Been running from it for the longest time

[Pre-Chorus]
So many mornings I woke up confused
In my dreams, I do anything I want to you
My emotions are naked, they're taking me out of my mind

[Chorus]
Right now, I'm shameless
Screamin' my lungs out for ya
Not afraid to face it
I need you more than I want to
Need you more than I want to
Show me you're shameless
Write it on my neck, why don't ya?
And I won't erase it
I need you more than I want to
Need you more than I want to

[Post-Chorus]
No-oh, uh-uh, don't wanna do this now
No-oh, uh-uh, don't wanna do this now
No-oh, uh-uh, don't wanna do this now
No-oh, uh-uh, don't wanna do this now

[Verse 2]
So we're there, now it's real
Now that you have me, do you want me still?
My kisses are history, they go back a long time, uh
And I'm tired of loving somebody that's not mine, no

[Pre-Chorus]
So many mornings I woke up confused
In my dreams, I do anything I want to you
My emotions are naked, they're taking me out of my mind (Mind)

[Chorus]
Right now, I'm shameless
Screamin' my lungs out for ya
Not afraid to face it
I need you more than I want to
Need you more than I want to
Show me you're shameless
Write it on my neck, why don't ya?
And I won't erase it
I need you more than I want to
Need you more than I want to

[Post-Chorus]
No-oh, uh-uh, don't wanna do this now
No-oh, uh-uh, don't wanna do this now
No-oh, uh-uh, don't wanna do this now
No-oh, uh-uh, don't wanna do this now

[Bridge]
Distance, inches in between us
I want you to give in, I want you to give in, oh
Weakness, tension in between us
I just wanna give in
And I don't care if I'm forgiven

[Chorus]
Right now, I'm shameless
Screamin' my lungs out for ya
Not afraid to face it
I need you more than I want to
Need you more than I want to
Show me you're shameless
Write it on my neck, why don't ya?
And I won't erase it
I need you more than I want to
I need you more than I want to

[Post-Chorus]
No-oh, uh-uh, don't wanna do this now
No-oh, uh-uh, don't wanna do this now
No-oh, uh-uh, don't wanna do this now
No-oh, uh-uh, don't wanna do this now

[Verse 1]
Dirty tissues, trust issues
Glasses on the sink, they didn't fix you
Lonely pillows in a stranger's bed
Little voices in my head
Secret keeping, stop the bleeding
Lost a little weight because I wasn't eating
All the songs that I can't listen to, to tell the truth

[Chorus 1]
Loving you was young, and wild, and free
Loving you was cool, and hot, and sweet
Loving you was sunshine, safe and sound
A steady place to let down my defenses
But loving you had consequences

[Verse 2]
Hesitation, awkward conversation
Running on low expectation
Every siren that I was ignoring
I'm paying for it

[Chorus 1]
Loving you was young, and wild, and free
Loving you was cool, and hot, and sweet
Loving you was sunshine, safe and sound
A steady place to let down my defenses
But loving you had consequences

[Bridge]
No, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Said, no, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Hey, yeah, no, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, mm

[Chorus 2]
Loving you was dumb, dark, and cheap
Loving you will still take shots at me
Found loving you was sunshine, but then it poured
And I lost so much more than my senses
'Cause loving you had consequences

[Outro]
Yeah, loving you

[Verse 1]
Why did you leave me here to burn?
I'm way too young to be this hurt
I feel doomed in hotel rooms
Staring straight up at the wall
Counting wounds, and I am trying to numb them all

[Refrain]
Do you care, do you care?
Why don't you care?
I gave you all of me
My blood, my sweat, my heart, and my tears
Why don't you care, why don't you care?
I was there, I was there, when no one was
Now you're gone, and I'm here

[Chorus 1]
I have questions for you
Number one, tell me who you think you are
You got some nerve trying to tear my faith apart
(I have questions for you)
Number two, why would you try and play me for a fool?
I should have never ever ever trusted you (I have questions)
Number three, why weren't you
Who you swore that you would be?
I have questions, I got questions haunting me
I have questions for you
I have questions for you (I have questions)
I have questions for you

[Verse 2]
My, my name was safest in your mouth
And why'd you have to go and spit it out?
Oh, your voice, it was the most familiar sound
But it sounds so dangerous to me now

[Chorus 2]
I have questions for you (He-ey)
Number one, tell me who you think you are
You got some nerve trying to tear my faith apart
(I have questions for you)
Number two, why would you try and play me for a fool?
I should have never ever ever trusted you
I have questions for you
I have questions for you
I have questions for you (I have questions)
I have questions for you

[Refrain]
Do you care, do you care?
Why don't you care?
I gave you all of me
My blood, my sweat, my heart, and my tears
Why don't you care, why don't you care?
I was there, I was there, when no one was
Now you're gone, and I'm here

[Outro]
I have questions for you (ooh)
I have questions for you
I have questions for you (I have questions)
I have questions for you (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
I have questions for you (ooh)
I have questions for you (foul play, no, foul play, no)
I have questions for you (I have questions)
I have questions for you
I have questions for you
How do I fix it? Can we talk? Can we communicate? Can we talk? Do I wanna fix it?
I have questions for you (I'm afraid of you)
Is it my fault? Is it my fault? Do you miss me?
I have questions

[Verse 1: Camila Cabello]
Baby, what'cha say?
I ain't here to, I ain't here to conversate
Baby, I don't play
From Miami, causin' trouble in LA
Rowdy, Tennessee
If I don't send for you, best not come for me
Jordan, 23
Guarantee you're gonna wanna leave with me
I got that li-li-li-like

[Chorus: Camila Cabello]
Pull up, pull up, pull up straight from Tokyo
You cannot believe it when we come through
Woo, my God, you look good today
Woo, my God, you look good today, yeah
Back up, back up, back up, do it slow-mo
When she drop, it bounce back like a yo-yo
Woo, my God, you look good today
You look good today, yeah
Oh my God

[Post-Chorus: Quavo & Camila Cabello]
Oh my God, yeah (Uh)
Oh my God, you're awesome (Oh my God)

[Verse 2: Camila Cabello]
Ice cold like my drink
Lose your concentration when you take a sip, yeah (Sip it, sip it)
Cyclone, make it spin
'Cause all I, all I, all I, all I do is win

[Bridge: Camila Cabello]
Yeah, I'm cut like a diamond, I'm cold
4 A.M., bloom like a rose
Girls like the summer, we're gold, uh
We got that li-li-li-like

[Chorus: Camila Cabello]
Pull up, pull up, pull up straight from Tokyo
You cannot believe it when we come through (Yeah, yeah)
Woo, my God, you look good today
Woo, my God, you look good today, yeah
Back up, back up, back up, do it slow-mo
When she drop, it bounce back like a yo-yo
Woo, my God (My God), you look good today
You look good today, yeah
Oh my God

[Post-Chorus: Quavo & Camila Cabello]
Oh my God, yeah (uh)

Oh my God, yeah (uh)
Oh my God, you're awesome (oh my God)
Oh my God, yeah

[Verse 3: Quavo & Camila Cabello]
Oh my God, she's so right, though (You know you're so right)
Me and you, that's a iso
Waist so small, look like lipo (Li-lipo)
Moonwalk, my diamonds Michael (Mi-Michael)
She's so fine, I call my best man (Brr)
Ain't no rings on her left hand (No rings)
I had a dream I was in quicksand (Dream)
Then I woke up with the best plans (Yeah)
Oh my God, yeah (Uh)
Oh my God, you're awesome (Yeah)
Smoke more green than Boston (Green)
I make a play and call 'em (Yeah)
Oh my God, she flossin' (Ooh)
On the cover of magazines
I'ma crown the queen (Queen)
Bad and boujee, thick and pretty
I'm givin' her wet dreams (Ooh, yeah)
I'm the main reason why her friends like me (Hey)
Havin' her mad at me, tackle me like I'm an athlete (Ooh, yeah)

[Chorus: Camila Cabello]
Pull up, pull up, pull up straight from Tokyo
You cannot believe it when we come through
Woo, my God, you look good today
Woo, my God, you look good today, yeah
Back up, back up, back up, do it slow-mo
When she drop, it bounce back like a yo-yo
Woo, my God, you look good today
You look good today, yeah
Oh my God

[Verse 1]
I don't care if you're here
Or if you're not alone
I don't care, it's been too long
It's kinda like we didn't happen
The way that your lips move
The way you whisper slow
I don't care, it's good as gone (Ah)

[Pre-Chorus]
I said I won't lose control, I don't want it (Ooh)
I said I won't get too close, but I can't stop it (Ooh)

[Chorus]
Oh no, there you go, making me a liar
Got me begging you for more
Oh no, there I go, startin' up a fire
Oh no, no
Oh no, there you go, you're making me a liar
I kinda like it though
Oh no, there I go, startin' up a fire
Oh no, no (Ooh)

[Verse 2]
You're watching, I feel it (Hey)
I know I shouldn't stay (Yeah, yeah)
I picture your hands on me (I think I wanna let it happen)
But what if you kiss me? (Yeah)
And what if I like it?
And no one sees it

[Pre-Chorus]
I said I won't lose control, I don't want it (Ooh)
I said I won't get too close, but I can't stop it (No, ooh)

[Chorus]
Oh no, there you go, making me a liar
Got me begging you for more
Oh no, there I go, startin' up a fire
Oh no, no (Oh no)
Oh no, there you go, you're making me a liar
I kinda like it though
Oh no, there I go, startin' up a fire
Oh no, no

[Post-Chorus]
Oh no, no, no
Yeah, here comes trouble, no, no
Startin' up a fire

[Bridge]
I don't believe myself when I
Say that I don't need you, oh
I don't believe myself when I say it
So, don't believe me

[Chorus]
Oh no, there you go, you're making me a liar
Got me begging you for more
Oh no, there I go, startin' up a fire
Oh no, no (Oh no)
Oh no, there you go, you're making me a liar

'Cause my clothes are on the floor

[Outro]
Huh, huh, huh
Uh
Oh no, no, no
Another fire

[Intro]
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah, I promise
Ooh

[Verse 1]
Tell me something, but say it with your hands, slow
When you touch me, paint me like a Van Gogh (Oh)
I wanna study every inch of you
'Til you trust me to make the angels come through

[Pre-Chorus]
Like a choir singing "Hallelujah"
When my body's crashin' right into ya
When we align, ooh yeah
Do you feel me?
Can you feel me?
'Cause I can't breathe

[Chorus]
Where did you come from, baby?
And were you sent to save me?
Ooh, there's God in every move
Ooh, and you're the living proof (Oh)
The way your hands can shake me
Soft to the touch like, baby
Ooh, there's God in every move
Ooh, and you're the living proof (Oh)

[Verse 2]
Count the freckles, as they run down your spine
Show your demons, and I might show you mine
One at a time, yeah, yeah, what are you hidin'?
What a design, yeah, yeah, I wanna dive in
What a divine moment
Can you feel me? (Oh)
Can you feel me? (Oh)
'Cause I can't breathe

[Chorus]
Where did you come from, baby?
And were you sent to save me?
Ooh, there's God in every move
Ooh, and you're the living proof (Oh)
The way your hands can shake me
Soft to the touch like, baby
Ooh, there's God in every move
Ooh, and you're the living proof (Oh)

[Bridge]
Like a choir singing "Hallelujah"
Ooh yeah, choir singing "Hallelujah"
Like a choir singing "Hallelujah"
Hallelujah, hallelujah
Choir singing "Hallelujah"
Body's crashin' right into ya (Oh)
Do you feel me?
Can you feel me?
'Cause I can't breathe (Oh)

[Chorus]
Where did you come from, baby?
And were you sent to save me? (Oh)
Ooh, there's God in every move

Ooh yeah, choir singing "Hallelujah" (Baby, babe)
Like a choir singing "Hallelujah" (Ooh), "Hallelujah" (Ooh)
And you're the living proof (Oh)

[Verse 1]
Loving you, I thought I couldn't get no higher
Your November rain could set the night on fire, night on fire
But we could only burn so long
Counterfeit emotions only run skin deep
Know you're lying when you're lying next to me, next to me
How did we get so far gone?

[Pre-Chorus]
I should know by now
You should know by now
We should know by now

[Chorus]
Something's gotta give, something's gotta break
But all I do is give, and all you do is take
Something's gotta change, but I know that it won't
No reason to stay is a good reason to go
Is a good reason to go, ooh

[Verse 2]
I have never heard a silence quite so loud
I walk in the room and you don't make a sound, make a sound
You're good at making me feel small
If it doesn't hurt me, why do I still cry?
If it didn't kill me, then I'm half alive, half alive
How did we get so far gone?

[Pre-Chorus]
I should know by now
You should know by now
We should know by now

[Chorus]
Something's gotta give, something's gotta break
But all I do is give, and all you do is take
Something's gotta change, but I know that it won't
No reason to stay is a good reason to go
Is a good reason to go

[Bridge]
I should know by now, you should know by now
I think I'm breaking right now, ooh
I should know by now, you should know by now
I think I'm breaking right now

[Chorus]
Something's gotta give, something's gotta break
But all I do is give, and all you do is take
Something's gotta change, but I know that it won't
No reason to stay is a good reason to go
Is a good reason to go, ooh

[Outro]
Something's gotta give

[Verse 1]
Cold, 'cause she has been here before
She doesn’t cry anymore, no looking back
No, she doesn't go to the bar
Too many lovers she's scarred, and they want her back

[Chorus]
She loves control, she wants it her way
And there's no way she'll ever stay unless you give it up
(Give it up)
She loves control, she wants it her way
And all it takes is just one taste, you wanna give it up
(Give it up)

[Verse 2]
Bold, you know she lives for the thrill
You know she lusts for the kill, so they won't come back
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no
Don't, don't you try taming the storm
Don't say you haven't been warned (oh)
'Cause she won't like that, like that

[Chorus]
'Cause she loves control, she wants it her way
And there's no way she'll ever stay unless you give it up
She loves control, she wants it her way
And all it takes is just one taste, you wanna give it up
(Give it up, give it up for love)

[Post-Chorus]
She loves control (control, hey)
She loves control (control, hey)

[Bridge]
Say what you want
But the way she kills you makes you feel alive
And you know that it feels right

[Chorus]
She loves control, she wants it her way
And there's no way she'll ever stay unless you give it up
She loves control, she wants it her way
And all it takes is just one taste, you wanna give it up

[Post-Chorus]
She loves control (control, hey)
She loves, she loves
She loves, she loves
Oh, you know that she loves it
She can't live without it, no
She loves control (control, hey)
Control, hey

[Chorus: Camila Cabello & Pharrell Williams]
Havana, ooh na-na (ayy)
Half of my heart is in Havana, ooh-na-na (ayy, ayy)
He took me back to East Atlanta, na-na-na
Oh, but my heart is in Havana (ayy)
There's somethin' 'bout his manners (uh huh)
Havana, ooh na-na (uh)

[Verse 1: Camila Cabello & Pharrell Williams]
Él vino a buscarme y ahí lo supe (uh)
(Vi clara su actitud)
Me dijo: "son tantas las que ya tuve" (uh)
(Pero me faltas tú)
No puedo soltarte, no seas tan cruel (hey)
(Desde esa noche azul)
Mi papa me dice que malo es él (uh)
¿Qué más puedo hacer?

[Pre-Chorus: Camila Cabello]
Ooh-ooh-ooh, lo supe en un segundo
Él cambiaría mi mundo
Ya no puedo más
Ooh-ooh-ooh, es que me duele mucho
Decir adiós, oh na-na-na-na-na

[Chorus: Camila Cabello & Pharrell Williams]
Havana, ooh na-na (ayy)
Half of my heart is in Havana, ooh-na-na (ayy, ayy)

Oh, but my heart is in Havana (ayy)
My heart is in Havana (ayy)
Havana, ooh na-na

[Verse 2: Camila Cabello]
I knew I was there when I read the sign
(Welcome to La Yuma)
I knew it was him when he hugged from behind
(It gets me every time)
He's put in work, but it's in the streets
(He said: "girl, can you ride?")
And this is the part that my daddy told me
He got me feelin' like

[Pre-Chorus: Camila Cabello]
Ooh-ooh-ooh, I knew it when I met him
I loved him when I left him
Got me feelin' like
Ooh-ooh-ooh, and then I had to tell him
I had to go, oh na-na-na-na-na

[Chorus: Camila Cabello & Pharrell Williams]
Havana, ooh na-na (ayy)
Half of my heart is in Havana, ooh-na-na (ayy, ayy)
He took me back to East Atlanta, na-na-na
Oh, but my heart is in Havana (ayy)
My heart is in Havana (ayy)
Havana, ooh na-na

[Bridge: Starrah & Camila Cabello]
Ooh na-na, oh na-na-na (oo-ooh)
Take me back, back, back like
Ooh na-na, oh na-na-na (yeah, babe)
Take me back, back, back like
Ooh na-na, oh na-na-na (yeah, yeah)
Take me back, back, back like
Ooh na-na, oh na-na-na (yeah, babe)
Take me back, back, back like
Take me back to my Havana...

[Chorus: Camila Cabello & Pharrell Williams]
Havana, ooh na-na
Half of my heart is in Havana, ooh-na-na (oh, yeah)
He took me back to East Atlanta, na-na-na (ayy, ayy)
Oh, but my heart is in Havana
My heart is in Havana (ayy)
Havana, ooh na-na

[Intro]
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha

[Verse 1]
You tell me that I'm complicated
And that might be an understatement
Anything else? (Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha)
You tell me that I'm indecisive
Fickle, but I try to hide it
Anything else? (Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha)
You tell me that I overthink
'Til I ruin a good thing
Anything else? (Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha)
You tell me that you'd rather fight
Than spend a single peaceful night
With somebody else (Ha-ha-ha-ha)

[Pre-Chorus]
You really, really know me
The future and the old me
All of the mazes and the madness in my mind
You really, really love me
You know me and you love me
And it's the kind of thing I always hoped I'd find, yeah

[Chorus]
Always thought I was hard to love
'Til you made it seem so easy, seem so easy
Always thought I was hard to love
'Til you made it seem so easy, seem so easy
Touch me 'til I find myself in a feeling
Tell me with your hands that you're never leaving (No)
Always thought I was hard to love
'Til you made it seem so easy (Seem so easy)

[Verse 2]
I never liked my crooked teeth
You tell me they're your favorite thing (Mm-hmm)
Anything else? (Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha)
The stretch marks all around my thighs
Kiss 'em 'til I change my mind
About everything else (Ha-ha-ha-ha)

[Pre-Chorus]
You really, really know me
The future and the old me
All of the mazes and the madness in my mind
You really, really love me
You know me and you love me (Ah)
And it's the kind of thing I always hoped I'd find

[Chorus]
Always thought I was hard to love
'Til you made it seem so easy, seem so easy (So easy, yeah)
Always thought I was hard to love

Tell me with your hands that you're never leaving (Oh, never)
Always thought I was hard to love (To love, yeah)
'Til you made it seem so easy, seem so easy (Oh)

All I know is you
Heal me when I'm broken
Heal me when I'm broken, oh
All I know is you
Saved me and you know it
Saved me and you know it (Saved me and you know it, ah)

[Chorus]
Always thought I was hard to love
'Til you made it seem so easy, seem so easy (Ah)
I always thought I was hard to love
'Til you made it seem so easy, seem so easy ('Til you made it, 'til you made it, oh)
Touch me 'til I find myself in a feeling
Tell me with your hands that you're never leaving (Tell me with your hands that you're)
Always thought I was hard to love
'Til you made it seem so easy, seem so easy

[Verse 1]
Your hair's grown a little longer
Your arms look a little stronger
Your eyes just as I remember (Ooh)
Your smile's just a little softer

[Pre-Chorus]
And I, yeah, I never prepared for a moment like that
Yeah, in a second it all came back, it all came back

[Chorus]
'Cause after all these years
I still feel everything when you are near
And it was just a quick "Hello," and you had to go
And you probably will never know
You're still the one I'm after all these years
(Ah, yeah)

[Verse 2]
Couldn't help but overhear you
Sounds like you're happy with her (Ooh-ooh, ooh)
But does she kiss you like I kissed you?
Ooh, I wish I loved you like I miss you

[Pre-Chorus]
And I, yeah, I never prepared for a moment like that
Yeah, in a second it all came back, it all came back

[Chorus]
'Cause after all these years
I still feel everything when you are near
And it was just a quick "Hello," and you had to go
And you probably will never know
You're still the one I'm after all these years, oh
'Cause after all these years
I still feel everything when you are near (You are near)
And it was just a quick "Hello," and you had to go (Ooh)
And you probably will never know
You're still the one I'm after all these years

[Bridge]
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah, yeah, yeah
Oh, I never told ya
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah, yeah, yeah
(Oh, yeah) I should've told you
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah, yeah, yeah (Ooh, ooh, ooh)
I never told you after all these years
(Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah, yeah, yeah)

[Outro]
Told you, I never told you (Never told you)
Told you, I never told you
I never told you after all these years

[Verse 1]
Yes, I'm gonna stay with him tonight
I’ll see you in the mornin'
No, of course he won't drink and drive
Can you say bye to mom for me?
Oh, you’ll like him, he's really kind
And he's funny like you sometimes
And I found someone I really like
Maybe for the first time

[Pre-Chorus]
No, I don't need a jacket
It's not that cold tonight
And you worry, I get it
But he's waitin' outside

[Chorus]
I swear on my heart that he's a good man
I know you’ll stay up late just waitin’ for me
You held me so tight, now someone else can
But you were the first man that really loved me

[Verse 2]
Now you're driving to the airport
Not just me you pick up anymore
I’ve got eight days off comin' up
And I can only come home for four

[Pre-Chorus]
Yeah, I just met his family
They're just like you and mom (Oh)
He makes me really happy
I think he might be the one, oh

[Chorus]
I swear on my heart that he's a good man
I promise he loves me, he’d never hurt me
You held me so tight, now someone else can
But you were the first man that really loved me
Now you're on the driveway, faking a smile
You wish you could tell him he doesn't deserve me
So I had to stop the car and turn around
To tell you you were the first man that really loved me

[Post-Chorus]
Ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah
Ah

[Bridge]
And before they open up the doors
I say, "I've never seen you cry before"
You say, "You've never looked so beautiful
You know you'll always be my little girl"

[Chorus]
You're looking at me while walking down the aisle
With tears in your eyes, maybe he deserves me
You don't even know how much it means to me now
That you were the first man that really loved me
Oh, really loved me
Oh, you really love me

[Intro: Pharrell Williams]
Hey

[Chorus: Camila Cabello & Pharrell Williams]
Havana, ooh na-na (ayy)
Half of my heart is in Havana, ooh-na-na (ayy, ayy)
He took me back to East Atlanta, na-na-na
Oh, but my heart is in Havana (ayy)
There's somethin' 'bout his manners (uh huh)
Havana, ooh na-na (uh)

[Verse 1: Camila Cabello & Pharrell Williams]
He didn't walk up with that "how you doin'?" (uh)
(When he came in the room)
He said there’s a lot of girls I can do with (uh)
(But I can't without you)
I knew him forever in a minute (hey)
(That summer night in June)
And papa says he got malo in him (uh)
He got me feelin' like

[Pre-Chorus: Camila Cabello]
Oooh-oooh-ooh, I knew it when I met him
I loved him when I left him
Got me feelin' like
Oooh-oooh-ooh, and then I had to tell him
I had to go, oh na-na-na-na-na

[Chorus: Camila Cabello & Pharrell Williams]
Havana, ooh na-na (ayy, ayy)
Half of my heart is in Havana, ooh-na-na (ayy, ayy)
He took me back to East Atlanta, na-na-na (uh huh)
Oh, but my heart is in Havana (ayy)
My heart is in Havana (ayy)
Havana, ooh na-na

[Verse 2: Camila Cabello]
I knew I was there when I read the sign
(Welcome to La Yuma)
I knew it was him when he hugged from behind
(It gets me every time)
He's put in work, but it's in the streets
(He said, "girl, can you ride?")
And this is the part that my daddy told me
He got me feelin' like

[Pre-Chorus: Camila Cabello]
Oooh-oooh-ooh, I knew it when I met him
I loved him when I left him
Got me feelin' like
Oooh-oooh-ooh, and then I had to tell him
I had to go, oh na-na-na-na-na

[Chorus: Camila Cabello & Pharrell Williams]
Havana, ooh na-na (ayy, ayy)
Half of my heart is in Havana, ooh-na-na (oh, ayy, ayy)
He took me back to East Atlanta, na-na-na (oh no)
Oh, but my heart is in Havana (ayy)
My heart is in Havana (ayy)
Havana, ooh na-na

[Bridge: Starrah & Camila Cabello]
Ooh na-na, oh na-na-na (oo-ooh)
Take me back, back, back like
Ooh na-na, oh na-na-na (yeah, babe)
Take me back, back, back like
Ooh na-na, oh na-na-na (yea, yeah)
Take me back, back, back like
Ooh na-na, oh na-na-na (yea, babe)
Take me back, back, back
Take me back to my Havana...

[Chorus: Camila Cabello & Pharrell Williams]
Havana, ooh na-na
Half of my heart is in Havana, ooh-na-na (oh, yeah)
He took me back to East Atlanta, na-na-na (ayy, ayy)
Oh, but my heart is in Havana
My heart is in Havana (ayy)
Havana, ooh na-na

[Intro]
No, no, no

[Verse 1]
Know just how to make me miss ya
When I'm feelin' sentimental
Goin' in our separate ways
But when I'm back here in the middle
Losin' you I couldn't face
But to love you is worse
Waitin' for ya just in case
One day it doesn't hurt, nah, nah, nah

[Pre-Chorus]
Said it's the last time, but nah, nah, nah, nah
Just like the last time, yeah, nah, nah, nah, nah
Tired of building up my walls, yeah
Just to watch them fall again

[Chorus]
So fuck this love callin' my name
Get out of my veins
If you need your space, then just walk away
You know how to fuck me up, then make it okay
I guess that's just your game, and I'm the one who gets played
Again, and again, and again, and again

[Verse 2]
Maybe you should set me free
Maybe I don't really want you to
Maybe I just wanna be
Be the person that you just can't lose
If you're gonna leave, then go
If you need me, let me know
Love me or just let me go
But no, nah, nah, nah

[Pre-Chorus]
Said it's the last time, but nah, nah, nah, nah
Just like the last time, yeah, nah, nah, nah, nah
Tired of building up my walls, yeah
Just to watch them fall again

[Chorus]
So fuck this love callin' my name
Get out of my veins
If you need your space, then just walk away
You know how to fuck me up, then make it okay
I guess that's just your game, and I'm the one who gets played
Again, and again, and again, and again

[Bridge]
Maybe you should set me free
Maybe I don't really want you to
Maybe I just wanna be
Be the person that you just can't lose
No, there I go and fall again

[Chorus]
Fuck this love (Yeah yeah) callin' my name
Get out of my veins (Get out of my veins)
If you need your space, then just walk away
You know how to fuck me up, then make it okay
I guess that's just your game (That's just your game)
And I'm the one who gets played
Again, and again, and again, and again, and again

[Outro]
Ooh, oh, again
Oh, no
Here I go again

[Verse 1]
Blank stares, faithless
Vampires at the same places
Shadows, traces
I know that you feel me

[Refrain]
You're runnin’, runnin', runnin', runnin’
Making the rounds with all your fake friends
Runnin', runnin' away from it
You can strip down without showing skin, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
I can see you're scared of your emotions
I can see you're hoping, you're not hopeless
So why can't you show me?
Why can't you show me?
I can see you’re looking for distractions
I can see you’re tired of the acting
So why can't you show me?

[Chorus]
Who are you in the dark? (I, I)
Show me the scary parts (I, I)
Who are you when it’s 3AM and you're all alone
And L.A. doesn't feel like home? (I, I, I)
Who are you in the dark?

[Verse 2]
Plus one, guest list
But you don't even know what her name is
Secrets, endless
I know that you feel me

[Refrain]
You’re runnin', runnin', runnin', runnin' (oh)
Making the rounds with all your fake friends (making)
Runnin', runnin' away from it (away)
You can strip down without showing skin, now

[Pre-Chorus]
I, I can see you're scared of your emotions
I can see you're hoping, you're not hopeless
So why can't you show me?
Why can't you show me?
I can see you're looking for distractions
I can see you're tired of the acting
So why can't you show me?

[Chorus]
Who are you in the dark? (I, I)
Show me the scary parts (I, I)
Who are you when it's 3AM and you're all alone
And L.A. doesn't feel like home? (I, I, I)
Who are you in the dark?

[Bridge]
Darling, come on and let me in
Darling, all of the strangers are gone, they're gone
I said, darling, come on and let me see
Darling, I promise that I won't run

[Chorus]
So tell me
Who are you in the dark? (I, I)
Show me the scary parts (I, I)
Who are you when it's 3 AM
And you're all alone (and you're all alone)
And L.A. doesn't feel like home? (No, I, I, I)
Who are you in the dark?

[Outro]
Mmmmm, mmmm, mmm
Who are you in the dark?
Mmmmm, mmmm, mmm
Who are you in the dark?
Mmmmm, mmmm, mmm
Who are you in the dark?

[Verse 1]
You must think that I'm stupid
You must think that I'm a fool
You must think that I'm new to this
But I have seen this all before

[Refrain]
I'm never gonna let you close to me
Even though you mean the most to me
'Cause every time I open up, it hurts
So I'm never gonna get too close to you
Even when I mean the most to you
In case you go and leave me in the dirt

[Pre-Chorus]
But every time you hurt me, the less that I cry
And every time you leave me, the quicker these tears dry
And every time you walk out, the less I love you
Baby, we don't stand a chance, it's sad but it's true

[Chorus]
I'm way too good at goodbyes
(I'm way too good at goodbyes)
I'm way too good at goodbyes
(I'm way too good at goodbyes)

[Verse 2]
I know you're thinkin' I'm heartless
I know you're thinkin' I'm cold
I'm just protectin' my innocence
I'm just protectin' my soul

[Refrain]
I'm never gonna let you close to me
Even though you mean the most to me
'Cause every time I open up, it hurts
So I'm never gonna get too close to you
Even when I mean the most to you
In case you go and leave me in the dirt

[Pre-Chorus]
But every time you hurt me, the less that I cry
And every time you leave me, the quicker these tears dry
And every time you walk out, the less l love you
Baby, we don't stand a chance, it's sad but it's true

[Chorus]
I'm way too good at goodbyes
(I'm way too good at goodbyes)
I'm way too good at goodbyes
(I'm way too good at goodbyes)
No way that you'll see me cry
(No way that you'll see me cry)
I'm way too good at goodbyes
(I'm way too good at goodbyes)

[Bridge]
No
No, no, no, no, no
(I'm way too good at goodbyes)
No, no, no, no
No, no, no
(I'm way too good at goodbyes)
(No way that you'll see me cry)
Ahhh
(I'm way too good at goodbyes)

[Outro]
'Cause every time you hurt me, the less that I cry
And every time you leave me, the quicker these tears dry
And every time you walk out, the less I love you
Baby, we don't stand a chance, it's sad but it's true
I'm way too good at goodbyes

[Verse 1]
Guess it's true, I'm not good at a one-night stand
But I still need love 'cause I'm just a man
These nights never seem to go to plan
I don't want you to leave, will you hold my hand?

[Chorus]
Oh, won't you stay with me?
'Cause you're all I need
This ain't love, it's clear to see
But darling, stay with me

[Verse 2]
Why am I so emotional?
No, it's not a good look, gain some self-control
And deep down I know this never works
But you can lay with me so it doesn't hurt

[Chorus]
Oh, won't you stay with me?
'Cause you're all I need
This ain't love, it's clear to see
But darling, stay with me
Oooh, oooh
Oooh, oooh

[Chorus]
Oh, won't you stay with me?
'Cause you're all I need
This ain't love, it's clear to see
But darling, stay with me

[Chorus]
Oh, won't you stay with me?
'Cause you're all I need
This ain't love, it's clear to see
But darling, stay with me

[Verse 1]
You and me, we made a vow
For better or for worse
I can't believe you let me down
But the proof's in the way it hurts
For months on end I've had my doubts
Denying every tear
I wish this would be over now
But I know that I still need you here

[Chorus]
You say I'm crazy
'Cause you don't think I know what you've done
But when you call me baby
I know I'm not the only one

[Verse 2]
You've been so unavailable
Now, sadly, I know why
Your heart is unobtainable
Even though Lord knows you kept mine

[Chorus]
You say I'm crazy
'Cause you don't think I know what you've done
But when you call me baby
I know I'm not the only one

[Bridge]
I have loved you for many years
Maybe I am just not enough
You've made me realise my deepest fear
By lying and tearing us up

[Chorus]
You say I'm crazy
'Cause you don't think I know what you've done
But when you call me baby
I know I'm not the only one

You say I'm crazy
'Cause you don't think I know what you've done
But when you call me baby
I know I'm not the only one

[Outro]
I know I'm not the only one
I know I'm not the only one
And I know, and I know, and I know, and I know, and I know, and I know, know
I know I'm not the only one

[Verse 1]
I'm young and I'm foolish, I've made bad decisions
I block out the news, turn my back on religion
Don't have no degree, I'm somewhat naïve
I've made it this far on my own
But lately, that shit ain't been gettin' me higher
I lift up my head and the world is on fire
There's dread in my heart and fear in my bones
And I just don't know what to say

[Chorus]
Maybe I'll pray, pray
Maybe I'll pray
I have never believed in you, no
But I'm gonna pray

[Verse 2]
You won't find me in church (No)
Readin' the Bible (No)
I am still here and I'm still your disciple
I'm down on my knees, I'm beggin' you, please
I'm broken, alone, and afraid
I'm not a saint, I'm more of a sinner
I don't wanna lose, but I fear for the winners
When I try to explain, the words run away
That's why I am stood here today

[Chorus]
And I'm gonna pray (Lord), pray (Lord), maybe I'll pray
Pray for a glimmer of hope
Maybe I'll pray (Lord), pray (Lord), maybe I'll pray
I've never believed in you, no, but I'm gonna...

[Bridge]
Won't you call me?
Can we have a one-on-one, please?
Let's talk about freedom
Everyone prays in the end
Everyone prays in the end
Oh, won't you call me?
Can we have a one-on-one, please?
Let's talk about freedom
Everyone prays in the end
Everyone prays in the end

[Chorus]
Oh, I'm gonna pray, I'm gonna pray, I'm gonna pray
Pray for a glimmer of hope
Maybe I'll pray, pray, maybe I'll pray
I've never believed in you, no, but I'm gonna pray

[Verse 1]
Yes I do, I believe
That one day I will be where I was
Right there, right next to you
And it's hard, the days just seem so dark
The moon, and the stars are nothing without you
Your touch, your skin, where do I begin?
No words can explain the way I'm missing you
Deny this emptiness, this hole that I'm inside
These tears, they tell their own story

[Pre-Chorus]
Told me not to cry when you were gone
But the feeling's overwhelming, it's much too strong

[Chorus]
Can I lay by your side, next to you, you?
And make sure you're all right
I'll take care of you
I don't want to be here if I can't be with you tonight

[Verse 2]
I'm reaching out to you
Can you hear my call?
This hurt that I've been through
I'm missing you, missing you like crazy

[Pre-Chorus]
You told me not to cry when you were gone
But the feeling's overwhelming, it's much too strong

[Chorus]
Can I lay by your side, next to you, you?
And make sure you're all right
I'll take care of you
I don't want to be here if I can't be with you tonight

[Bridge]
Lay me down tonight, lay me by your side
Lay me down tonight, lay me by your side

[Outro]
Can I lay by your side, next to you, you?

[Verse 1]
I'm done hatin' myself for feelin'
I'm done cryin' myself awake
I gotta leave and start the healin'
But when you move like that, I just wanna stay

[Pre-Chorus]
What have I become now?
Lookin' through your phone now
Oh now, love to you is just a game
Look what I have done now
Dialling up the numbers on you
I don't want my heart to break

[Chorus]
Baby, how do you sleep when you lie to me?
All that shame and all that danger
I'm hopin' that my love will keep you up tonight
Baby, how do you sleep when you lie to me?
All that fear and all that pressure
I'm hopin' that my love will keep you up tonight

[Post-Chorus]
(Tell me, how do you—)
Love will keep you up tonight
(Tell me, how do you—)

[Verse 2]
Oh, no, how did I manage to lose me?
I am not this desperate, not this crazy
There's no way I'm stickin' 'round to find out
I won't lose like that, I won't lose myself

[Pre-Chorus]
Look what I have done (Done)
Diallin' up the numbers on you
I don't want my heart to break

[Chorus]
Baby, how do you sleep when you lie to me?
All that shame and all that danger
I'm hopin' that my love will keep you up tonight
Baby, how do you sleep when you lie to me?
All that fear and all that pressure
I'm hopin' that my love will keep you up tonight

[Post-Chorus]
(Tell me how do you—)
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Love will keep you up tonight
(Tell me how do you—)
Oh, love will keep you up tonight

[Chorus]
Baby, how do you sleep when you lie to me?
All that shame and all that danger
I'm hopin' that my love will keep you up tonight
Baby, how do you sleep when you lie to me? (Oh)
All that fear and all that pressure (Oh)
I'm hopin' that my love will keep you up tonight
(Tell me how do you—)

[Verse 1]
I've been here before
But always hit the floor
I've spent a lifetime runnin'
And I always get away
But with you I'm feeling something
That makes me want to stay
I'm prepared for this
I never shoot to miss
But I feel like a storm is coming
If I'm gonna make it through the day
Then there's no more use in runnin'
This is something I gotta face

[Pre-Chorus]
If I risk it all
Could you break my fall?

[Chorus]
How do I live? How do I breathe?
When you're not here I'm suffocating
I wanna feel love run through my blood
Tell me is this where I give it all up?
For you I have to risk it all
Cause the writing's on the wall

[Verse 2]
A million shards of glass
That haunt me from my past
As the stars begin to gather
And the light begins to fade
When all hope begins to shatter
Know that I won't be afraid

[Pre-Chorus]
If I risk it all
Could you break my fall?

[Chorus]
How do I live? How do I breathe?
When you're not here I'm suffocating
I wanna feel love, run through my blood
Tell me is this where I give it all up?
For you I have to risk it all
Cause the writing's on the wall

[Bridge]
The writing's on the wall

[Chorus]
How do I live? How do I breathe?
When you're not here I'm suffocating
I wanna feel love, run through my blood
Tell me is this where I give it all up?
How do I live? How do I breathe?
When you're not here I'm suffocating
I wanna feel love run through my blood
Tell me is this where I give it all up?
For you I have to risk it all
Cause the writing's on the wall

[Verse 1]
I choose me, and I know that's selfish, love
You are a dream, and I can't thank you enough
But I give another piece of me away
Every wakin' day that I'm with you
Am I a monster? What will your family think of me?
They brought me in, they helped me out with everything
But I give a little piece of me away
Every single day

[Chorus]
So I pick up the pieces, I get on the midnight train
I got my reasons, but darlin', I can't explain
I'll always love you
But tonight's the night I choose to walk away
Bah-bah, doo, bah-bah, doo
Bah-bah, doo, bah-bah, doo

[Verse 2]
Love you so much that I have to let you go
I'll miss your touch and the secrets we both know
But it would be wrong for me to stay
And I'll just give you hope

[Chorus]
So I pick up the pieces, I get on the midnight train
I got my reasons, but darlin', I can't explain
I'll always love you
But tonight's the night I choose to walk away
I can't stop cryin', I hate that I've caused you pain
But I can't deny it, I just don't feel the same
I'll always love you
But tonight's the night I choose to walk away
Bah-bah, doo, bah-bah, doo
Bah-bah, doo, bah-bah, doo
So I pick up the pieces, I get on the midnight train
I got my reasons, but darlin', I can't explain
I'll always love you
But tonight's the night I choose to walk away

[Verse 1]
My head is filled with ruins
Most of them, I built with you
Now the dust no longer moves
Don't disturb the ghost of you, mmm
They are empty, they are worn
Tell me what we built this for
On my way to somethin' more
You're that one I can't ignore, mmm

[Chorus]
I'm gonna miss you
I still care
Sometimes I wish we never built this palace
But real love is never a waste of time, mmm

[Verse 2]
Yeah, I know just what you're sayin'
And I regret ever complainin'
About this heart and all its breakin'
It was beauty we were makin', mmm
And I know we'll both move on
You'll forgive what I did wrong
They will love the better you
But I still own the ghost of you, mmm

[Chorus]
I'm gonna miss you
I'm still there
Sometimes I wish we never built this palace
But real love is never a waste of time, oh
I'm gonna miss you
I'm still there
Sometimes I wish we'd never built this palace
But real love is never a waste of time
But real love is never a waste of time

[Verse 1]
My mother said I'm too romantic
She said, "You're dancing in the movies"
I almost started to believe her
Then I saw you and I knew
Maybe it's 'cause I got a little bit older
Maybe it's all that I've been through
I'd like to think it's how you lean on my shoulder
And how I see myself with you

[Pre-Chorus]
I don't say a word
But still, you take my breath and steal the things I know
There you go, saving me from out of the cold

[Chorus]
Fire on fire would normally kill us
But this much desire, together, we're winners
They say that we're out of control and some say we're sinners
But don't let them ruin our beautiful rhythms
'Cause when you unfold me and tell me you love me
And look in my eye
You are perfection, my only direction
It's fire on fire, mmm
It's fire on fire

[Verse 2]
When we fight, we fight like lions
But then we love and feel the truth
We lose our minds in a city of roses
We won't abide by any rules

[Pre-Chorus]
I don't say a word
But still, you take my breath and steal the things I know
There you go, saving me from out of the cold

[Chorus]
Fire on fire would normally kill us
But this much desire, together, we're winners
They say that we're out of control and some say we're sinners
But don't let them ruin our beautiful rhythms
'Cause when you unfold me and tell me you love me
And look in my eye
You are perfection, my only direction
It's fire on fire, oh
It's fire on fire

[Bridge]
Fire on fire would normally kill us
But this much desire, together, we're winners
They say that we're out of control and some say we're sinners
But don't let them ruin our beautiful rhythms

[Chorus]
Fire on fire would normally kill us
But this much desire, together, we're winners
They say that we're out of control and some say we're sinners
But don't let them ruin our beautiful rhythms
'Cause when you unfold me and tell me you love me
And look in my eye
You are perfection, my only direction
It's fire on fire

[Outro]
You are perfection, my only direction
It's fire on fire

[Verse 1]
Holy Father, we need to talk
I have a secret that I can't keep
I'm not the boy that you thought you wanted
Please don't get angry, have faith in me

[Chorus]
Say I shouldn't be here but I can't give up his touch
It is him I love, it is him
Don't you try and tell me that God doesn't care for us
It is him I love, it is him I love

[Verse 2]
I walk the streets of Mississippi
I hold my lover by the hand
I feel you staring when he is with me
How can I make you understand?

[Chorus]
Say I shouldn't be here but I can't give up his touch
It is him I love, it is him
Don't you try and tell me that God doesn't care for us
It is him I love, it is him I love

[Bridge]
Ohh, ohh
Oh, I love
Ohh, ohh
No, no, I love
Ohh, ohh
I love
Ohh, ohh
Ohh, ohh
Him I love
Ohh, ohh
Him I love
Ohh, ohh
Him I love
Ohh, ohh
Him I love

[Outro]
Holy Father, judge my sins
I'm not afraid of what they will bring
I'm not the boy that you thought you wanted
I love him

[Verse 1]
Maybe one day I won't sing about you
I'll sing a song about someone new
But right here, right now, you are on my mind
And I think about you all the time

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm sendin' a message to you
And I'm hopin' that it will get through

[Chorus]
When it was good, it was bittersweet, honey
You made me sad, till I loved the shade of blue
I know you don't want to talk to me, so this is what I will do
Maybe you're listenin', so here's one last song for you
Here's one last song for you

[Verse 2]
And I hope it makes you feel
And I hope it makes you burn
And I hope it reminds you of how much it hurt

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm sendin' a message to you
And I'm hopin' that it will get through

[Chorus]
When it was good, it was bittersweet, honey
You made me sad, till I loved the shade of blue
I know you don't want to talk to me, so this is what I will do
Maybe you're listenin', so here's one last song for you

[Bridge]
In case you hear this, then know you're the love of my life
Want to tell you I'm sorry, I miss havin' you by my side
When you were mine

[Chorus]
When it was good, it was bittersweet, honey
You made me sad, till I loved the shade of blue
I know you don't want to talk to me, so this is what I will do
Maybe you're listenin', so here's one last song for you
Here's one last song for you

[Intro]
I've been burnin', yes, I've been burnin'
Such a burden, this flame on my chest
No insurance, to pay for the damage
Yeah, I've been burnin' up since you left

[Verse 1]
I've been smokin', oh, more than twenty a day
Blame it on rebellion, don't blame it on me
Wish I was younger back to the nineteenth of May
I had an open mind, swore to never change

[Pre-Chorus]
Funny how time goes by
Had respect for myself that river ran dry
You reached a limit, I wasn't enough
It's like the fire replaced all the love

[Chorus]
I've been burnin', yes, I've been burnin'
Such a burden, this flame on my chest
No insurance, to pay for the damage
Yeah, I've been burnin' up since you left

[Verse 2]
Oh, if you ever called, I will run straight back
Give you my forgiveness and the shirt off my back
No friends to turn to, yeah, I messed up that
Wish we could smoke again, just for a day, oh

[Pre-Chorus]
Funny how time goes by
Had respect for myself that river ran dry
You reached a limit, I wasn't enough
And it's like the fire replaced all the love

[Chorus]
I've been burnin', yes, I've been burnin'
Such a burden, this flame on my chest
No insurance, to pay for the damage
Yeah, I've been burnin' up since you left

[Outro]
Yeah, I've been burnin' up since you left
Oh, I've been burnin' up since you left

[Intro]
It is if everyone dies alone
Does that scare you?
I don't wanna be alone

[Verse 1]
I look for you
Every day, every night
I close my eyes
From the fear, from the light

[Pre-Chorus]
As I wander down the avenue, so confused
Guess I'll try and force a smile

[Chorus]
Pink lemonade sippin' on a Sunday
Couples holding hands on a runway
They're all posing in a picture frame
Whilst my world's crashing down
Solo shadow on a sidewalk
Just want somebody to die for
Sunshine livin' on a perfect day
While my world's crashing down
I just want somebody to die for

[Verse 2]
I long for you
Just a touch (Does that scare you?)
Of your hand
You don't leave my mind
Lonely days, I'm feeling
Like a fool for dreaming

[Pre-Chorus]
As I wander down the avenue, so confused
Guess I'll try and force a smile

[Chorus]
Pink lemonade sippin' on a Sunday
Couples holding hands on a runway
They're all posing in a picture frame
Whilst my world's crashing down
Solo shadow on a sidewalk
Just want somebody to die for
Sunshine livin' on a perfect day
While my world's crashing down
I just want somebody to die for

[Bridge]
I just want somebody to die for (To die for)
I just want somebody to die for
(Does that scare you?)
(I don't wanna be alone)

[Chorus]
Pink lemonade sippin' on a Sunday
Couples holding hands on a runway (Oh)
They're all posing in a picture frame
Whilst my world's crashing down
Solo shadow on a sidewalk
Just want somebody to die for
Sunshine livin' on a perfect day
While my world's crashing down
I just want somebody to die for
I just want somebody to die for (To die for)

[Verse 1]
When I signed my deal
I felt pressure don't want to see the numbers
I want to see heaven
You say could you write a song for me?
I say I'm sorry I won't do that happily

[Pre-Chorus]
When I go home, I tend to close the door
I never wanted more, so sing with me, can't you see?

[Chorus]
I don't have money on my mind
Money on my mind
I do it for, I do it for the love
I don't have money on my mind
Money on my mind
I do it for, I do it for the love

[Post-Chorus]
I do it for the love
I do it for the love

[Verse 2]
Please don't get me wrong, I wanna keep it moving
I know what that requires, I'm not foolish
Please can you, make this work for me?
'Cause I am not a puppet, I will work against your strings

[Pre-Chorus]
When I go home, I tend to close the door
I never wanted more, so sing with me, can't you see?

[Chorus]
I don't have money on my mind
Money on my mind
I do it for, I do it for the love
I don't have money on my mind
Money on my mind
I do it for, I do it for the love

[Post-Chorus]
I do it for the love
I do it for the love

[Bridge]
When the sun will set
Don't you fret
No, I have no money on my mind
No money on my mind
No money on my mind
No, I have no money on my mind
When the sun will set
Don't you fret
No, I have no money on my mind
No money on my mind
No money on my mind
No, I have no money on my mind
Just love

[Chorus]
Money on my mind
Money on my mind
I do it for, I do it for the love
I don't have money on my mind
Money on my mind
I do it for, I do it for the love

[Post-Chorus]
I do it for the love
I do it for the love

[Verse 1]
I regret that I told the world
That you were with me
And I regret how I showed the world
That you were pretty
I never thought I'd learn so much
So much from bein' lonely
But I guess I didn't learn enough
'Cause now you won't hold me

[Chorus]
I guess I got lost in the moment
I guess I got lost in the fall
I guess I got lost in your heartbeat
In the thrill of it all
And I guess you were goddamn perfect
'Cause every single time you call
I remind myself of what I lost that night, my love
In the thrill of it all
In the thrill of it all

[Verse 2]
Even though we weren't in love
It was far from lust
Yeah, you were beautiful
But in you I could trust
Others, they warned my heart
They said I would lose fast
They said that you were stoppin' ground
And soon to be my past

[Chorus]
I guess I got lost in the moment
I guess I got lost in the fall
I guess I got lost in your heartbeat
In the thrill of it all
And I guess you were goddamn perfect
'Cause every single time you call
I remind myself of what I lost that night, my love
In the thrill of it all, oh
In the thrill of it all

[Outro]
And I guess you were goddamn perfect
'Cause every single time you call
I remind myself of what I lost that night, my love
I remind myself of what I lost that night, my love
I remind myself of what I lost that night, my love
In the thrill of it all

[Verse 1: Sam Smith & YEBBA]
I see you in the morning, feel your fingers in my hair
Sometimes I still pretend you're there
It hits me without warning, your reflection walking by
But I know it's only in my mind

[Pre-Chorus: YEBBA,  Sam Smith, Both]
Will you show me the piece of my heart I've been missin'?
Won't you give me the part of myself that I can't give back?
Will you show me the piece of my heart I've been missin'?
'Cause I'd kill for you, and darlin', you know that

[Chorus: YEBBA, Sam Smith, Both]
So I'll light up a cigarette
I'll drink it down till there's nothin' left
'Cause I sure can't get no sleep
And Lord knows there's no relief
You held my heart in your fingertips
So now I drown in my bitterness
Oh, I can't get no sleep
And I sure won't, I sure won't find no peace
No peace

[Verse 2: YEBBA & Sam Smith]
All that I am askin' is for a little clarity
That's all that really matters to me
In and out of focus, tears are in my eyes
We're burnin' down the bridges this time

[Pre-Chorus: YEBBA,  Sam Smith, Both]
Will you show me the piece of my heart I've been missin'?
Won't you give me the part of myself that I can't give back?
Will you show me the piece of my heart I've been missin'?
'Cause I'd kill for you, and darlin', you know that

[Chorus: YEBBA & Sam Smith]
So I'll light up a cigarette
I'll drink it down till there's nothin' left
'Cause I sure can't get no sleep
And Lord knows there's no relief
You held my heart in your fingertips
So now I drown in my bitterness
Oh, I can't get no sleep
And I sure won't, I sure won't find

[Bridge: Sam Smith & YEBBA]
I used to find comfort in your arms
Caught up in the wonder of your charms
Oh, I'll cry for you, I'll cry for you
I'll lie for you, I'll lie for you
But I don't even know you anymore

[Chorus: YEBBA & Sam Smith]
So I'll light up a cigarette
I'll drink it down till there's nothin' left
'Cause I sure can't get no sleep
And Lord knows there's no relief
You held my heart in your fingertips
So now I drown in my bitterness
Oh, I can't get no sleep
And I sure won't, I sure won't find no peace

[Outro: YEBBA & Both]
Sure won't find no peace, no, no
Will you give me the piece
Will you give me the piece of my heart?
Will you give me the piece
Will you give me the piece of my heart?

[Verse 1]
I never feel like this
I'm used to emptiness in my heart
And in my arms
You're not what I'm used to
You keep me guessin' with things that you do
I hope that they're true

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause I'm never gonna heal my past
If I run every time it starts
So I need to know if I'm in this alone

[Chorus]
Come on, baby, say it first
I need to hear you say those words
If I'm all that you desire, I promise there'll be fire
I need to hear you say it first
Come on, baby, do your worst
I know you'll take me higher
So come on, darling
If you love me, say it first
Say it, say it, say it
Won't you say it to me?
Say it, say it, say it
Won't you say it to me?

[Verse 2]
I know you're right for me
But I'm waiting for everything in your world
To align with my world
I think of you while I sleep
I dream of what we could be if we grow
Together unfold

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause I'm never gonna heal my past
If I run every time it starts
So I need to know if I'm in this alone

[Chorus]
Come on, baby, say it first
I need to hear you say those words
If I'm all that you desire, I promise there'll be fire
I need to hear you say it first
Come on, baby, do your worst
I know you'll take me higher
So come on, darling
If you love me, say it first
Say it, say it, say it
Won't you say it to me?
Say it, say it, say it
Won't you say it to me?
Say it first
Say it, say it, say it
Won't you say it to me?
Say it, say it, say it
Won't you say it to me?
Come on, baby, say it first
I need to hear you say those words
If I'm all that you desire, I promise there'll be fire
I need to hear you say it first
Come on, baby, do your worst
I know you'll take me higher
So come on, darling
If you love me, say it first
Say it, say it, say it
Won't you say it to me?
Say it, say it, say it
Won't you say it to me?
Say it, say it, say it
Won't you say it to me?
Say it, say it, say it
Won't you say it to me?

[Verse 1]
This is for my mother
From the older brother of your children, made of three
Now you found your lover
'Cause it wasn't our father who made you laugh and happy
It's been a long five years
I've cried a thousand tears, and here we are, after the war
But we're so much better
Now the skies are clearer, now there's no more slammin' doors

[Chorus]
Now, I say
Dear Mother, how you've come so far
Your love has fixed all of our broken hearts
I hope you're proud, Mother, of what you've done
It's a lifelong lesson and I'm not pretendin' when I say
You cleared up my scars
You cleared up my scars

[Verse 2]
This is for my father
From the older brother of your children made of three
Yeah, you've been so good to us
And showed us how to live and taught us to be free
But when Mother told you
That she didn't love you, all these bridges hit the sea
So you built another one
And helped us cross it, even though you were in need

[Chorus]
Now, I say
Dear Father, how you've come so far
Your love has fixed all of our broken hearts
I hope you're proud, Father, of what you've done
It's a lifelong lesson and I'm not pretendin' when I say
You cleared up my scars
You cleared up my scars
You cleared up my scars
You cleared up my scars

[Outro]
Dear Mother, how you've come so far
Your love has fixed all of our broken hearts
I hope you're proud, Mother, of what you've done
It's a lifelong lesson and I'm not pretendin' when I say
You cleared up my scars

[Verse 1]
You say that you're leavin', but I don't think I can let go
When you put the phone down, I began to cry
What are you to do, when the person that you love just says no?
Boy, get yourself together, move on with your life

[Pre-Chorus]
So I'm gonna play my favourite rhythm
Got to get you out my system
I would do anything to keep you off my mind
I'm gonna have to call my sisters
Be around the ones who listen
Anything to drown you out tonight

[Chorus]
Baby, you make me crazy
Why'd you have to fill my heart with sorrow?
Save me, make it all hazy
So I don't think about you till tomorrow

[Verse 2]
It wasn't enough, but you could've had the guts to face me
It would have meant so much, if you'd looked me in the eye
Why do I always fall for the ones who have no courage?
I must see some kind of beauty in their lies

[Pre-Chorus]
So I'm gonna play my favourite rhythm
Got to get you out my system
I would do anything to keep you off my mind
I'm gonna have to call my sisters
Be around the ones who listen
Anything to drown you out tonight

[Chorus]
Baby, you make me crazy
Why'd you have to fill my heart with sorrow?
Save me, make it all hazy
So I don't think about you till tomorrow
Baby, you make me crazy
Why'd you have to fill my heart with sorrow?
Save me, make it all hazy
So I don't think about you till tomorrow
Baby, you make me crazy
Why'd you have to fill my heart with sorrow?
Save me, make it all hazy
So I don't think about you till tomorrow

[Verse 1: Luke]
Remember the words you told me
"Love me 'til the day I die"
Surrender my everything
'Cause you made me believe you're mine
Yeah, you used to call me baby
Now you're calling me by name
Takes one to know one, yeah
You beat me at my own damn game

[Pre-Chorus: Luke]
You push and you push and I'm pulling away
Pulling away from you
I give and I give and I give and you take
Give and you take

[Chorus: Luke & All]
Youngblood
Say you want me, say you want me out of your life
And I'm just a dead man walking tonight
But you need it, yeah, you need it all of the time
Yeah, ooh, ooh, ooh
Youngblood
Say you want me, say you want me back in your life
So I’m just a dead man crawling tonight
'Cause I need it, yeah, I need it all of the time
Yeah, ooh, ooh, ooh

[Verse 2: Luke]
Lately our conversations
End like it's the last goodbye
Then one of us gets too drunk
And calls about a hundred times
So, who you been calling baby?
Nobody could take my place
When you’re looking at those strangers
Hope to God you see my face

[Chorus: Luke & All]
Youngblood
Say you want me, say you want me out of your life
And I'm just a dead man walking tonight
But you need it, yeah, you need it all of the time
Yeah, ooh, ooh, ooh
Youngblood
Say you want me, say you want me back in your life
So I’m just a dead man crawling tonight
'Cause I need it, yeah, I need it all of the time
Yeah, ooh, ooh, ooh

[Bridge: Luke]
You push and you push and I'm pulling away
Pulling away from you
I give and I give and I give and you take
Give and you take
You're running around and I'm running away
Running away from you, mmm, from you

[Chorus: All]
Youngblood
Say you want me, say you want me out of your life
And I'm just a dead man walking tonight
But you need it, yeah, you need it all of the time
Yeah, ooh, ooh, ooh
Youngblood
Say you want me, say you want me back in your life
So I’m just a dead man crawling tonight
'Cause I need it, yeah, I need it all of the time
Yeah, ooh, ooh, ooh

[Outro: All]
You push and you push and I'm pulling away
Pulling away from you
I give and I give and I give and you take
Give and you take
Youngblood
Say you want me
Say you want me out of your life
And I'm just a dead man walking tonight

[Verse 1: Luke]
Some days, you're the only thing I know
Only thing that's burning when the nights grow cold
Can't look away, can't look away
Beg you to stay, beg you to stay, yeah
Sometimes, you're a stranger in my bed
Don't know if you love me or you want me dead
Push me away, push me away
Then beg me to stay, beg me to stay, yeah

[Pre-Chorus: Luke]
Call me in the morning to apologize
Every little lie gives me butterflies
Something in the way you're looking through my eyes
Don't know if I'm gonna make it out alive

[Chorus: Luke & All]
Fight so dirty, but you love so sweet
Talk so pretty, but your heart got teeth
Late night devil, put your hands on me
And never, never, never ever let go
Fight so dirty, but you love so sweet
Talk so pretty, but your heart got teeth
Late night devil, put your hands on me
And never, never, never ever let go

[Verse 2: Luke]
Some days, you're the best thing in my life
Sometimes when I look at you, I see my wife
Then you turn into somebody I don't know
And you push me away, push me away, yeah

[Pre-Chorus: Luke]
Call me in the morning to apologize
Every little lie gives me butterflies
Something in the way you're looking through my eyes
Don't know if I'm gonna make it out alive

[Chorus: Luke & All]
Fight so dirty, but you love so sweet
Talk so pretty, but your heart got teeth
Late night devil, put your hands on me
And never, never, never ever let go
Fight so dirty, but you love so sweet
Talk so pretty, but your heart got teeth
Late night devil, put your hands on me
And never, never, never ever let go

[Bridge: Luke]
Blood on my shirt, rose in my hand
You're looking at me like you don't know who I am
Blood on my shirt, heart in my hand
Still beating

[Chorus: Luke & All]
Fight so dirty, but you love so sweet
Talk so pretty, but your heart got teeth
Late night devil, put your hands on me
And never, never, never ever let go
Fight so dirty, but you love so sweet
Talk so pretty, but your heart got teeth
Late night devil, put your hands on me
And never, never, never ever let go

[Outro: All]
Teeth
Teeth
Teeth
Never, never, never ever let go

[Verse 1: Luke]
I saw you looking brand new overnight
And I caught you looking too, but you didn't look twice
You look happy, oh, mmm
You look happy, oh

[Pre Chorus: Luke & Calum]
Flashing back to New York City
Changing flights so you stay with me
Remember thinking that I got this right

[Chorus: Luke & Calum]
Now I wish we never met
'Cause you're too hard to forget
While I'm cleaning up your mess
I know he's taking off your dress
I know that you don’t, but if I ask you if you love me
I hope you lie, lie, lie, lie, lie to me

[Verse 2: Luke]
It's 3 AM and the moonlight’s testing me (ah)
If I can make it 'til dawn, then it won’t be hard to see (ah)
I ain’t happy, oh, mmm mmmmm
I ain't too happy, ohhh, mmm

[Pre Chorus: Luke & Calum]
Flashing back to New York City
Changing flights so you stay with me
Problem was, I thought I had this right

[Chorus: Luke & Calum]
Now I wish we never met
'Cause you're too hard to forget
While I’m cleaning up your mess
I know he’s taking off your dress
I know that you don’t, but if I ask you if you love me
I hope you lie, lie, lie, lie, lie to me
Singing, lie, lie, lie, lie, lie
Li-li-lie, lie, lie, lie, lie
Lie, lie, lie, lie, lie
Li-li-lie, lie, lie, lie, lie
And I know that you don’t, but if I ask you if you love me
I hope you lie, lie, lie, lie, lie to me

[Verse 1: Calum]
I love the light in your eyes and the dark in your heart
You love our permanent chase and the bite of our bark
We know we're classic together like Egyptian gold
We love us

[Pre-Chorus: Luke]
It don't matter, be combative or be sweet cherry pie
It don't matter just as long as I get all you tonight

[Chorus: Luke, Michael & Calum]
I can take you out, oh, oh
We can kill some time, stay home
Throw balloons, teddy bears and the chocolate eclairs away
Got nothing but love for you, fall more in love every day
Valentine, valentine

[Verse 2: Michael]
So deep, your DNA's being messed with my touch
Can’t beat us
So real, fueling the fire until we combust
Can’t touch us

[Pre-Chorus: Luke]
It don’t matter be combative or be sweet cherry pie
It don’t matter just as long as I get all you tonight

[Chorus: Luke, Michael & Calum]
I can take you out, oh, oh
We can kill some time, stay home
Throw balloons, teddy bears and the chocolate eclairs away
Got nothing but love for you, fall more in love every day
Valentine, valentine

[Bridge: Luke]
Full plate, don’t wait, have your cake and eat it too
Full plate, don’t wait, have your cake and eat it

[Chorus: Luke, Michael & Calum]
I can take you out, oh, oh
We can kill some time, stay home
Throw balloons, teddy bears and the chocolate eclairs away
Got nothing but love for you, fall more in love every day
Valentine, valentine
Valentine, valentine

[Verse 1: Luke]
Can't help but wondering if this
Is the last time that I'll see your face
Is it tears or just the fucking rain?
Wish I could say something
Something that doesn't sound insane
But lately, I don't trust my brain
You tell me I won't ever change
So I just say nothing

[Chorus: All]
And no matter where I go
I'm always gonna want you back
No matter how long you're gone
I'm always gonna want you back
I know you know
I will never get over you
No matter where I go
I'm always gonna want you back
Want you back

[Verse 2: Luke]
I remember the freckles on your back
And the way that I used to make you laugh
'Cause you know every morning I wake up
Yeah, I still reach for you
I remember the roses on your shirt
When you told me this would never work
You know, even when I say I moved on
Yeah, I still dream for you

[Chorus: All]
And no matter where I go
I'm always gonna want you back
No matter how long you're gone
I'm always gonna want you back
I know you know
I will never get over you
No matter where I go
I'm always gonna want you back
Want you back
(I'm always gonna want you back)
(Want you back)
(I'm always gonna want you back)
(Want you back)

[Bridge: Luke]
You know even when I say I moved on
You know even though I know that you're gone
All I think about is where I went wrong
You know even when I say I moved on
You know even though I know that you're gone
All I think about is where I went wrong
Yeah, I still dream for you
No matter where I go, I'm always gonna want you back

[Chorus: All]
No matter where I go
I'm always gonna want you back (I'm always gonna want you back now)
No matter how long you're gone
I'm always gonna want you back
I know you know
I will never get over you
No matter where I go
I'm always gonna want you back
Want you back

[Outro: All]
Always gonna want you back
Want you back
Always gonna want you back
Want you back

[Intro: Luke]
Is it easier to stay? Is it easier to go?
I don't wanna know, oh
But I know that I'm never, ever gonna change
And you know you don't want it any other way

[Verse 1: Luke]
Why do we always gotta run away?
And we wind up in the same place
It's like we're looking for the same thing
Same thing, yeah
Yeah, do we really gotta do this now?
Right here with all your friends around
In the morning, we can work it out
Work it out

[Pre-Chorus: Luke, with All]
I love you so much that I hate you
Right now, it's so hard to blame you
'Cause you're so damn beautiful
So damn beautiful

[Chorus: Luke, with All]
Is it easier to stay? Is it easier to go?
I don't wanna know, oh
But I know that I'm never, ever gonna change
And you know that you're always gonna stay the same
Is it easier to stay? Is it easier to go?
I don't wanna know, oh
But I know that I'm never, ever gonna change
And you know you don't want it any other way

[Verse 2: Luke]
Every time that you say you're gonna leave
That's when you get the very best of me
You know we need it like the air we breathe
Air we breathe, yeah

[Pre-Chorus: Luke, with All]
I love you so much that I hate you (Oh)
Right now, it's so hard to blame you (Oh)
'Cause you're so damn beautiful (Oh)
So damn beautiful (Oh)

[Chorus: Luke, with All]
Is it easier to stay? Is it easier to go?
I don't wanna know, oh
But I know that I'm never, ever gonna change
And you know that you're always gonna stay the same
Is it easier to stay? Is it easier to go?
I don't wanna know, oh (I don't wanna know)
But I know that I'm never, ever gonna change
And you know you don't want it any other way

[Bridge: Luke]
The hardest part of all (Da-da-da-dum-da-da-da-da)
Is that we're only built to fall (Is it easier?)

[Chorus: Luke, with All]
Is it easier to stay? Is it easier to go?
I don't wanna know, oh (Oh)
But I know that I'm never, ever gonna change
And you know that you're always gonna stay the same (Is it easier?)
Is it easier to stay? Is it easier to go? (Yeah)
I don't wanna know, oh (Oh)
But I know that I'm never, ever gonna change
And you know you don't want it any other way

[Outro: All & Luke]
I love you so much that I hate you (Hate you)
Right now, it's so hard to blame you
'Cause you're so damn beautiful

[Verse 1]
Angel, with the gun in your hand
Pointin' my direction, givin' me affection
Love is fatal, won't you give it a chance?
Center of attention, don't you ask me any questions

[Pre-Chorus]
Go on and light me like a cigarette
Even if it might be somethin' you'll regret
You got me now, now, now
Swallow me down, down, down, down

[Chorus]
I only light up when cameras are flashin'
Never enough and no satisfaction
Got no shame
I love the way you're screaming my name
Diggin' my grave to get a reaction
Changin' my face and callin' it fashion
Got no shame
I love the way you're screaming my name

[Verse 2]
Lay me in the palm of your hand
I'll give you my permission, you'll always be forgiven
Go on, replace me
When you're cravin' somethin' sweeter than the words I left in your mouth
Go on and spit me out

[Chorus]
I only light up when cameras are flashin'
Never enough and no satisfaction
Got no shame
I love the way you're screaming my name
Diggin' my grave to get a reaction
Changin' my face and callin' it fashion
Got no shame
I love the way you're screaming my name

[Post-Chorus]
I love the way you're screaming my name
I love the way you're screaming my name

[Bridge]
Go on and light me like a cigarette
Even if it might be somethin' you'll regret
You got me now, now, now
Swallow me down, down, down, down

[Chorus]
I only light up when cameras are flashin'
Never enough and no satisfaction
Got no shame
I love the way you're screaming my name
Diggin' my grave to get a reaction
Changin' my face and callin' it fashion
Got no shame
I love the way you're screaming my name

[Post-Chorus]
I love the way you're screaming my name
I love the way you're screaming my name

[Verse 1: Luke]
Here I am waking up, still can't sleep on your side
There's your coffee cup, the lipstick stain fades with time
If I can dream long enough, you'd tell me I'd be just fine
I'll be just fine

[Chorus: Luke]
So I drown it out like I always do
Dancing through our house with the ghost of you
And I chase it down, with a shot of truth
Dancing through our house with the ghost of you

[Verse 2: Calum]
Cleaning up today, found that old Zeppelin shirt
You wore when you ran away, and no one could feel your hurt
We're too young, too dumb, to know things like love
But I know better now, better now

[Chorus: Luke & All]
So I drown it out like I always do
Dancing through our house with the ghost of you
And I chase it down, with a shot of truth
Dancing through our house with the ghost of you

[Bridge: Calum]
Too young, too dumb
To know things like love
Too young, too dumb

[Chorus: Luke]
So I drown it out like I always do
Dancing through our house with the ghost of you
And I'll chase it down, with a shot of truth
That my feet don't dance like they did with you

[Verse 1: Calum]
I drove by all the places we used to hang out getting wasted
I thought about our last kiss, how it felt, the way you tasted
And even though your friends tell me you're doing fine
Are you somewhere feeling lonely even though he’s right beside you?
When he says those words that hurt you
Do you read the ones I wrote you?

[Pre-Chorus: Calum]
Sometimes I start to wonder, was it just a lie?
If what we had was real, how could you be fine?
'Cause I'm not fine at all

[Chorus: All & Luke]
I remember the day you told me you were leaving
I remember the make-up running down your face
And the dreams you left behind, you didn't need them
Like every single wish we ever made
I wish that I could wake up with amnesia
And forget about the stupid little things
Like the way it felt to fall asleep next to you
And the memories I never can escape
'Cause I'm not fine at all

[Verse 2: Calum]
The pictures that you sent me, they're still living in my phone
I'll admit I like to see them, I'll admit I feel alone
And all my friends keep asking why I'm not around
It hurts to know you’re happy, yeah, it hurts that you moved on
It’s hard to hear your name when I haven't seen you in so long

[Pre-Chorus: Calum]
It’s like we never happened, was it just a lie?
If what we had was real, how could you be fine?
'Cause I'm not fine at all

[Chorus: All & Luke]
I remember the day you told me you were leaving
I remember the make-up running down your face
And the dreams you left behind you didn't need them
Like every single wish we ever made
I wish that I could wake up with amnesia
And forget about the stupid little things
Like the way it felt to fall asleep next to you
And the memories I never can escape

[Bridge: Luke]
If today I woke up with you right beside me
Like all of this was just some twisted dream
I'd hold you closer than I ever did before
And you'd never slip away
And you'd never hear me say

[Chorus: All]
I remember the day you told me you were leaving
I remember the make-up running down your face
And the dreams you left behind you didn't need them
Like every single wish we ever made
I wish that I could wake up with amnesia
And forget about the stupid little things
Like the way it felt to fall asleep next to you
And the memories I never can escape

[Outro: Luke]
'Cause I'm not fine at all
No, I'm really not fine at all
Tell me this is just a dream
'Cause I'm really not fine at all

[Intro: Luke]
Thinking 'bout you lots lately
Have you been eating breakfast alone like me?
Thinking 'bout you lots lately

[Verse 1: Calum]
Is it bad that I'm hoping that you're broken?
Is it bad that I'm wishing you're still broken?
That you haven't found fish in the ocean
Is it bad? So bad
Is it weird that I'm drunk and on my sofa?
Is it weird that I'm naked on my sofa?
All alone, damn, I wish I didn't know ya
Is it weird? So weird

[Pre Chorus: Luke]
I know I’m the stupid one who ended it
And now I'm the stupid one regretting it
It took me a couple drinks to admit it
I know I’m the stupid one

[Chorus: All]
Thinking about you lots lately
Have you been eating breakfast alone like me?
Thinking about you lots lately
Or are you moving along?
Been thinking about you lots lately
Have you been feeling empty beds just like me?
I've been thinking about you lots, lately
Or are you moving along?

[Verse 2: Luke]
Is it wrong if I ask you to come over?
Is it wrong if I tell you that I love ya?
Even though I'd never do it when I'm sober
Is it wrong? So wrong

[Pre Chorus: Luke]
I know I’m the stupid one who ended it
And now I'm the stupid one regretting it
It took me a couple drinks to admit it
I know I’m the stupid one

[Chorus: All]
Thinking about you lots lately
Have you been eating breakfast alone like me?
Thinking about you lots lately
Or are you moving along?
Been thinking about you lots lately
Have you been feeling empty beds just like me?
I've been thinking about you lots lately
Or are you moving along?

[Bridge: Ashton & Luke]
Scared of moving on, but you're already gone
So if you’re moving on, won't you just tell me
Scared of moving on, but you’re already gone
So if you’re moving on, won't you just tell me

[Chorus: All]
Thinking about you lots lately
Have you been eating breakfast alone like me?
Thinking about you lots lately
Or are you moving along?
Been thinking about you lots lately
Have you been feeling empty beds just like me?
I've been thinking about you lots lately
Or are you moving along?

[Outro: Michael & Luke]
Scared of moving on, but you're already gone
So if you’re moving on
Are you moving along?

Wildflower

[Verse 1: Calum]
I hear you callin' out my name
I love the sound, I love the taste
And I can see it in your face
You've got a side you can't explain

[Pre-Chorus: Calum]
You're tellin' me, you're tellin' me, you're tellin' me you wanna come over

A fatal love song
Waterfall is overflowin'
You're the only one who makes me
Every time we
Tell you what I like
My wildflower

[Verse 2: Calum]
I see the colour in your veins
It makes me smile, it makes me shake (Ooh)
I see the shadow in my brain
And I like its look, and I like its shape (Ooh)

[Pre-Chorus: Calum]
You're tellin' me, you're tellin' me, you're tellin' me you wanna come over
You wanna be, you wanna be, you wanna be, you wanna be closer
I love it when you wear your hair down over your shoulder
'Cause I wanna hold ya

[Intro: All]
Hey-hey, hey-hey, hey-hey, hey
Hey-hey, hey-hey, hey-hey, hey

[Verse 1: Luke]
Simmer down, simmer down
They say we’re too young now to amount to anything else
But look around
We worked too damn hard for this just to give it up now
If you don’t swim, you’ll drown
But don’t move, honey

[Chorus: All]
You look so perfect standing there
In my American Apparel underwear
And I know now that I’m so down
Your lipstick stain is a work of art
I got your name tattooed in an arrow heart
And I know now that I’m so down
Hey
Hey-hey, hey-hey, hey-hey, hey

[Verse 2: Calum]
Let’s get out, let’s get out
'Cause this deadbeat town’s only here just to keep us down
While I was out
I found myself alone just thinking
If I showed up with a plane ticket
And a shiny diamond ring with your name on it
Would you wanna run away too?
'Cause all I really want is you

[Chorus: All]
You look so perfect standing there
In my American Apparel underwear
And I know now that I’m so down
I made a mixtape straight out of ‘94
I’ve got your ripped skinny jeans lying on the floor
And I know now that I’m so down
Hey
Hey-hey, hey-hey, hey-hey, hey

[Bridge: Luke]
You look so perfect standing there
In my American Apparel underwear
And I know now that I'm so down
Your lipstick stain is a work of art
I got your name tattooed in an arrow heart
And I know now that I’m so down

[Chorus: All]
Hey
Hey-hey, hey-hey, hey-hey, hey
You look so perfect standing there
In my American Apparel underwear
And I know now that I’m so down (Hey)
Your lipstick stain is a work of art
I got your name tattooed in an arrow heart
And I know now that I’m so down
Hey

[Verse 1: Luke]
They would yell, they would scream, they were fighting it out
She would hope, she would pray, she was waiting it out
Holding onto a dream
While she watches these walls fall down
Sharp words like knives, they were cutting her down
Shattered glass like the past, it’s a memory now
Holding onto a dream
While she watches these walls fall down

[Chorus: Calum]
Hey, mom, hey, dad
When did this end?
When did you lose your happiness?
I'm here alone inside of this broken home
Who’s right? Who’s wrong?
Who really cares?
The fault, the blame, the pain’s still there
I'm here alone inside of this broken home, this broken home

[Verse 2: Calum]
Wrote it down on the walls, she was screaming it out
Made it clear she’s still here, are you listening now?
Just a ghost in the halls
Feeling empty, they’re vacant now
All the battles, all the wars, all the times that you’ve fought
She’s a scar, she’s the bruises, she’s the pain that you brought
There was life, there was love
Like a light and it’s fading out

[Chorus: Luke]
Hey, mom, hey, dad
When did this end?
When did you lose your happiness?
I'm here alone inside of this broken home
Who’s right? Who’s wrong?
Who really cares?
The fault, the blame, the pain’s still there
I'm here alone inside of this broken home, this broken home

[Bridge: Michael]
You've gotta let it go
You’re losing all your hope
Nothing left to hold
Locked out in the cold
Your pain and memories
They washed out all the scenes
I'm stuck in between
A nightmare and lost dreams

[Chorus: Michael & All & Calum]
Hey, mom, hey, dad
When did this end?
When did you lose your happiness?
I'm here alone inside of this broken home
Hey, mom, hey, dad
When did this end?
When did you lose your happiness?
I'm here alone inside of this broken home
Who’s right? Who’s wrong?
Who really cares?
The fault, the blame, the pain’s still there
I'm here alone inside of this broken home
This broken home

[Verse 1: Michael]
Everybody's got their demons
Even wide awake or dreaming
I'm the one who ends up leaving
Make it okay
See a war, I wanna fight it
See a match, I wanna strike it
Every fire I've ignited
Faded to grey

[Pre-Chorus: Michael]
But now that I’m broken
Now that you know it
Caught up in a moment
Can you see inside?

[Chorus: Michael & All]
'Cause I've got a jet black heart
And there's a hurricane underneath it
Trying to keep us apart
I write with a poison pen
But these chemicals moving between us
Are the reason to start again

[Verse 2: Luke & (Calum)]
Now I'm holding on for dear life (Now I'm holding on for dear life)
There's no way that we could rewind (There's no way that we could rewind)
Maybe there's nothing after midnight
That could make you stay

[Pre-Chorus: Ashton & (Michael)]
But now that I'm broken (Now that I'm broken)
And now that you know it (Now that you know it)
Caught up in a moment
Can you see inside?

[Chorus: All]
'Cause I've got a jet black heart
And there's a hurricane underneath it
Trying to keep us apart
I write with a poison pen
But these chemicals moving between us
Are the reason to start again

[Bridge: Calum]
The blood in my veins is made up of mistakes
Let's forget who we are and dive into the dark
As we burst into color, returning to life

[Chorus: Michael & All]
'Cause I've got a jet black heart
And there's a hurricane underneath it
Trying to keep us apart
I write with a poison pen
But these chemicals moving between us
Are the reason to start again

[Outro: Calum & (All)]
The blood in my veins is made up of mistakes
(To start again)
Let's forget who we are and dive into the dark

[Verse 1: Calum]
I thought we had a place, just our place, our home base, my headspace
Was you and I always, but that phase has been phased in our place
I see it on your face, a small trace, a blank slate, we've been erased
But if we're way too faded to drive, you can stay one more night

[Chorus: Calum/All]
We said we'd both love harder than we knew we could go
But still the hardest part is knowing when to let go
You wanted to go higher, higher, higher
Burn too bright, now the fire's gone
Watch it all fall down: Babylon

[Post-Chorus: Calum]
Babylon
Burn too bright, now the fire's gone, watch it all fall down

[Verse 2: Calum]
I'm tired of the feud, your short fuse, my half-truths are not amused
I wish we had a clue to start new, a white moon, no residue
The color of our mood is so rude, a cold June, we're not immune
But if we're way too faded to fight, you can stay one more night

[Chorus: Calum/All]
We said we'd both love harder than we knew we could go
But still the hardest part is knowing when to let go
You wanted to go higher, higher, higher
Burn too bright, now the fire's gone
Watch it all fall down: Babylon

[Post-Chorus: Calum]
Babylon
Burn too bright, now the fire's gone, watch it all fall down

[Chorus: Calum & All]
We said we'd both love harder than we knew we could go
But still the hardest part is knowing when to let go
You wanted to go higher, higher, higher
Burn too bright, now the fire's gone, watch it all fall down
We said we'd both love harder than we knew we could go
But still the hardest part is knowing when to let go
You wanted to go higher, higher, higher
Burn too bright, now the fire's gone
Watch it all fall down: Babylon

[Post-Chorus: Calum]
Babylon
Burn too bright, now the fire's gone, watch it all fall down

[Verse 1: Luke]
Lover of mine, maybe we'll take some time
Kaleidoscope mind gets in the way
Hope and I pray, darling, that you will stay
Butterfly lies, chase them away, mmm

[Pre-Chorus: Luke & Calum]
Dance around the living room
Lose me in the sight of you
I've seen the red, I've seen the blue
Take all of me
Deep to where your secrets hide
Where we've been a thousand times
Swallow every single lie
Take all of me

[Chorus: Luke]
I'll never give you away
'Cause I already made that mistake
If my name never fell off your lips again
I know it'd be such a shame
When I take a look at my life and all of my crimes
You're the only thing that I think I got right
I'll never give you away
'Cause I already made, already made that mistake

[Verse 2: Luke, Luke & Calum]
Lover of mine, I know you're colourblind
I watched the world fall from your eyes, ooh
All my regrets and things you can't forget
Light them all up, kiss them goodbye

[Pre-Chorus: Luke & Calum]
Dance around the living room
Lose me in the sight of you
I've seen the red, I've seen the blue
Take all of me
Deep to where your secrets hide
Where we've been a thousand times
Swallow every single lie
Take all of me

[Chorus: Luke & Calum]
I'll never give you away
'Cause I already made that mistake
If my name never fell off your lips again
I know it'd be such a shame
When I take a look at my life and all of my crimes
You're the only thing that I think I got right
I'll never give you away
'Cause I already made, already made that mistake

[Verse 1: Luke]
Some things are meant to be secret and not to be heard
So if I tell you, just keep it and don't say a word
Yeah, when the doors are all closing, it's bound to get loud
'Cause all these bodies are hoping to get addicted to sound

[Pre-Chorus: Luke]
Oh, not everything is so primitive
Oh, but I'm giving in

[Chorus: Luke & Ashton]
If these walls could talk, I'd hope they wouldn't say anything
Because they've seen way too many things
'Cause we'd fall from grace, we're falling
Yeah, we'd fall from grace
If these walls could talk, I'd hope they wouldn't say anything
Because they've seen way too many things
'Cause we'd fall from grace, we're falling
Yeah, we'd fall from grace
If these walls could talk

[Post-Chorus: Luke]
If these walls could talk
If these walls could talk

[Verse 2: Calum]
I love your hair in your face
I wouldn't dare let you down
Don't let that glass go to waste
Oh, you're a queen but uncrowned

[Pre-Chorus: Luke]
Oh, not everything is so primitive
Oh, but I'm giving in

[Chorus: Luke & Ashton]
If these walls could talk, I'd hope they wouldn't say anything
Because they've seen way too many things
'Cause we'd fall from grace, we're falling
Yeah, we'd fall from grace
If these walls could talk

[Post-Chorus: Ashton]
If these walls could talk
If these walls could talk

[Bridge: Luke]
Some things are meant to be secret and not to be heard
So if I tell you, just keep it and don't say a word
Yeah, when the doors are all closing, it's bound to get loud
'Cause all these bodies are hoping to get addicted to sound

[Chorus: Luke & Ashton]
If these walls could talk, I'd hope they wouldn't say anything
Because they've seen way too many things
'Cause we'd fall from grace, we're falling
Yeah, we'd fall from grace
If these walls could talk

[Post-Chorus: Ashton]
If these walls could talk
If these walls could talk

[Verse 1: Luke]
I don't wanna think about a moment with you
I'm kinda hoping for forever
I've been dreaming 'bout a knitted sweater for two
Goddamnit, we look good together

[Pre Chorus: Luke]
Would you wait a moment?
They're ringing the bell for last call
Would you wait a moment?
Just give me a second, that's all

[Chorus: All]
Oh, talk fast, romance
Oh, it won't last, I'm okay with that
Oh, burn, crash, romance
Oh, I'll take what I can get from you
Talk fast, romance
Oh, it won't last, I'm okay with that
Oh, burn, crash, romance
Oh, I'll take what I can get from you

[Verse 2: Calum]
Leave all of your indecisions with you at home
Don't say you're doing me a favor
Why so complicated, won't you throw me a bone?
I want your love in every flavor

[Pre Chorus: Calum]
Would you wait a moment?
They're ringing the bell for last call
Would you wait a moment?
Just give me a second, that's all

[Chorus: All]
Oh, talk fast, romance
Oh, it won't last, I'm okay with that
Oh, burn, crash, romance
Oh, I'll take what I can get from you
Talk fast, romance
Oh, it won't last, I'm okay with that
Oh, burn, crash, romance
Oh, I'll take what I can get from you

[Bridge: Luke]
Oh, oh, oh, oh, ringing the bell for last call
Oh, oh, oh, oh, ringing the bell for last call
Oh, oh, oh, oh, ringing the bell for last call (talk fast, won't last)
Oh, oh, oh, oh, ringing the bell for last call (burn, crash, talk fast)

[Chorus: Luke & All]
Talk fast, romance
Oh, talk fast, romance
Oh, it won't last, I'm okay with that
Oh, burn, crash, romance
Oh, I'll take what I can get from you
Talk fast, romance
Oh, it won't last, I'm okay with that
Oh, burn, crash, romance
Oh, I'll take what I can get from you

[Outro: Calum]
Talk fast, oh, oh
Won't last, oh, oh
Burn, crash, oh, oh
Talk fast, oh, oh

[Verse 1: Luke, Calum & (Ashton)]
My girlfriend’s bitching 'cause I always sleep in
She’s always screaming when she’s calling her friends
She’s kinda hot though
Yeah, she’s kinda hot though
(Just a itty bitty, little bit hot)
My shrink is telling me I've got crazy dreams
She’s also saying I've got low self-esteem
She’s kinda hot though
Yeah, she’s kinda hot though
(Just a little bit, a little bit hot)
She put me on meds, she won’t get out of my head
She’s kinda hot though
(1,2,3 ... go!)

[Verse 2: Luke & (Ashton)]
My friend left college 'cause it felt like a job
His mum and dad both think he’s a slob
He’s got a shot though
(No, no, not really)
Yeah, he’s got a shot though
(No, no, not really)
When you've got bigger plans that no one else understands
You've got a shot though
(My, my, that's a big plan you've got there!)

[Chorus: All & (Ashton)]
They say we’re losers and we’re alright with that
We are the leaders of the not coming backs
But we’re alright though
Yeah, we’re alright though
We are the kings and the queens of the new broken scene
Yeah, we’re alright though
(Uno, dos, tres, cuatro!)

[Verse 3: Ashton & (All)]
Sometimes I'm feeling like I'm going insane
My neighbour told me that I've got bad brains
But I'm alright though (We're alright though)
Yeah, we’ll be alright though (We're alright though)
'Cause we're the kings and the queens of the new broken scene
And we're alright though
(1, 2, 3, 4!)

[Chorus: All]
They say we’re losers and we’re alright with that
We are the leaders of the not coming backs
But we’re alright though (We're alright though)
Yeah, we’re alright though (We're alright though)
We are the kings and the queens of the new broken scene
Yeah, we’re alright though (We're gonna be okay)


[Outro: All]

We are the kings and the queens of the new broken scene
Yeah, we’re alright though

[Intro: Luke]
Shout out to the old me and everything you showed me
Glad you didn't listen when the world was trying to slow me
No one could control me, left my lovers lonely
Had to fuck it up before I really got to know me

[Verse 1: Luke]
Never a night alone, anywhere you wanna go
Woke up in the mornin' wearin' someone else's clothes
Pictures in my phone with people I don't know
Woke up in the mornin', how the hell'd I make it home?

[Pre-Chorus: Luke]
And they wondered how long I could keep it up
While I wondered if I'd ever, if I'd ever get enough
And I did some shit I never should've done, eh-eh
I would do it over now, I'd do it over

[Chorus: Luke]
Shout out to the old me and everything you showed me
Glad you didn't listen when the world was trying to slow me
No one could control me, left my lovers lonely
Had to fuck it up before I really got to know me, eh-eh
All of the mistakes I made, I made, I made, I made
Whatever the price I paid, I paid, I paid, I paid
Shout out to the old me and everything you showed me
Had to fuck it up before I let you get to know me

[Verse 2: Luke]
Another round, here we go, going in blow for blow
Look into the mirror, take the punches that I throw
I'm constantly reminded of all the compromises
By the people from my past who have a hard time letting go, yeah

[Pre-Chorus: Luke]
And they wondered how long I could keep it up
While I wondered if I'd ever, if I'd ever get enough
And I did some shit I never should've done, eh-eh
I would do it over now, I'd do it over

[Chorus: Luke]
Shout out to the old me and everything you showed me
Glad you didn't listen when the world was trying to slow me
No one could control me, left my lovers lonely
Had to fuck it up before I really got to know me, eh-eh
All of the mistakes I made, I made, I made, I made
Whatever the price I paid, I paid, I paid, I paid
Shout out to the old me and everything you showed me
Had to fuck it up before I let you get to know me, eh-eh

[Bridge: Luke]
Devil at my door
Got me knockin', knockin', knockin' on the other side
Ashes on the floor
But I'm walkin', walkin', walkin' outta here alive

[Chorus: Luke with Calum]
Shout out to the old me and everything you showed me
Glad you didn't listen when the world was trying to slow me (The world was trying to slow me, yeah)
No one could control me, left my lovers lonely (Lonely)
Had to fuck it up before I really got to know me, eh-eh
All of the mistakes I made, I made, I made, I made
Whatever the price I paid, I paid, I paid, I paid (Yeah)
Shout out to the old me and everything you showed me (Yeah, the old me)
Had to fuck it up before I let you get to know me, eh-eh

Shopping sprees in Paris

Say it's us (Say it's us) and I'll agree, baby

[Bridge]
If you say you want a good time
Well here I am baby, here I am baby
Talk to me, talk to me, talk to me
Tell me what's on your mind (What's on your mind)
If you want it, girl come and get it
All this is here for you
Tell me baby, tell me, tell me baby
What you tryna do

[Chorus]
Gold jewelry shining so bright
Strawberry champagne on ice
Lucky for you, that's what I like, that's what I like
Lucky for you, that's what I like, that's what I like

[Verse 1]
Let's take our time tonight, girl
Above us all the stars are watchin'
There's no place I'd rather be in this world
Your eyes are where I'm lost in
Underneath the chandelier
We're dancin' all alone
There's no reason to hide
What we're feelin' inside
Right now

[Pre-Chorus]
So, baby, let's just turn down the lights
And close the door
Oooh I love that dress
But you won't need it anymore
No, you won't need it no more
Let's just kiss 'til we're naked, baby

[Chorus]
Versace on the floor
Oooh take it off for me, for me, for me, for me now, girl
Versace on the floor
Oooh take it off for me, for me, for me, for me now, girl

[Verse 2]
Now I unzip the back to watch it fall
While I kiss your neck and shoulders
No, don't be afraid to show it all
I'll be right here ready to hold you
Girl, you know you're perfect from
Your head down to your heels
Don't be confused by my smile
'Cause I ain't ever been more for real, for real

[Pre-Chorus]
So just turn down the lights
And close the door
Oooh I love that dress
But you won't need it anymore

[Verse 1]
Same bed but it feels just a little bit bigger now
Our song on the radio but it don't sound the same
When our friends talk about you, all it does is just tear me down
'Cause my heart breaks a little when I hear your name

[Pre-Chorus]
It all just sounds like oooooh ooh
Mmm, too young, too dumb to realize

[Chorus]
That I should have bought you flowers
And held your hand
Should have gave you all my hours
When I had the chance
Take you to every party
'Cause all you wanted to do was dance
Now my baby's dancing
But she's dancing with another man

[Verse 2]
My pride, my ego, my needs, and my selfish ways
Caused a good, strong woman like you to walk out my life
Now I'll never, never get to clean up the mess I made (oh)
And it haunts me every time I close my eyes

[Pre-Chorus]
It all just sounds like oooooh ooh
Mmm, too young, too dumb to realize

[Chorus]
That I should have bought you flowers
And held your hand
Should have gave you all my hours
When I had the chance
Take you to every party
'Cause all you wanted to do was dance
Now my baby's dancing
But she's dancing with another man

[Bridge]
Although it hurts
I'll be the first to say that I was wrong
Oh, I know I'm probably much too late
To try and apologize for my mistakes
But I just want you to know

[Chorus]
I hope he buys you flowers
I hope he holds your hand
Give you all his hours
When he has the chance
Take you to every party
'Cause I remember how much you loved to dance
Do all the things I should have done
When I was your man

[Outro]
Do all the things I should have done
When I was your man

[Verse 1]
Ooh, don't we look good together?
There's a reason why they watch all night long
Yeah, know we'll turn heads forever
So tonight I'm gonna show you off

[Pre-Chorus]
When I'm walkin' with you
I watch the whole room change
Baby, that's what you do
No my baby don't play
Blame it on my confidence
Oh, blame it on your measurements
Shut that shit down on sight
That's right

[Chorus]
We out here drippin' in finesse
It don't make no sense
Out here drippin' in finesse
You know it, you know it
We out here drippin' in finesse
It don't make no sense
Out here drippin' in finesse
You know it, you know it

[Verse 2]
Now slow it down for me baby
'Cause I love the way it feels when we grind
Yeah, our connection's so magnetic on the floor
Nothing can stop us tonight

[Pre-Chorus]
When I'm walkin' with you
I watch the whole room change
Baby, that's what you do
No my baby don't play
Blame it on my confidence
Oh, blame it on your measurements
Shut that shit down on sight
That's right

[Chorus]
We out here drippin' in finesse
It don't make no sense
Out here drippin' in finesse
You know it, you know it
We out here drippin' in finesse
It don't make no sense
Out here drippin' in finesse
You know it, you know it

[Bridge]
Fellas, grab your ladies if your lady fine
Tell her she the one, she the one for life (woo)
Ladies, grab your fellas and let's do this right (do this right)
If you're on one like me in mind (ow!)
Yeah, we got it goin' on, got it goin' on
Don't it feel so good to be us? (ayy)
Yeah, we got it goin' on, got it goin' on (yeah)
Girl, we got it goin' on
Yeah, we got it goin' on, got it goin' on (hey)
Don't it feel so good to be us, ayy? (feels so good on you)
Yeah, we got it goin' on, got it goin' on

[Chorus]
We out here drippin' in finesse (we drippin' on them)
It don't make no sense
Out here drippin' in finesse
You know it, you know it
We out here drippin' in finesse with my baby
It don't make no sense
Out here drippin' in finesse
You know it, you know it (yeah, you know we got it goin' on)

[Outro]

Girl, we got it
Don't it feel so good to be us, ayy?
Yeah, we got it goin' on, got it goin' on
You know it, you know it

[Verse 1]
Oh, her eyes, her eyes
Make the stars look like they're not shinin'
Her hair, her hair
Falls perfectly without her trying
She's so beautiful
And I tell her every day
Yeah, I know, I know
When I compliment her she won't believe me
And it's so, it's so
Sad to think that she don't see what I see
But every time she asks me, "Do I look okay?"
I say

[Chorus]
When I see your face
There's not a thing that I would change
'Cause you're amazing just the way you are
And when you smile
The whole world stops and stares for a while
'Cause, girl, you're amazing just the way you are

[Verse 2]
Her lips, her lips
I could kiss them all day if she'd let me
Her laugh, her laugh
She hates but I think it's so sexy
She's so beautiful, and I tell her every day
Oh you know, you know, you know
I'd never ask you to change
If perfect's what you're searching for
Then just stay the same
So don't even bother asking if you look okay
You know I'll say

[Chorus]
When I see your face
There's not a thing that I would change
'Cause you're amazing just the way you are
And when you smile
The whole world stops and stares for a while
'Cause, girl, you're amazing just the way you are

[Post-Chorus]
The way you are
The way you are
Girl, you're amazing just the way you are

[Chorus]
When I see your face
There's not a thing that I would change
'Cause you're amazing just the way you are
And when you smile
The whole world stops and stares for a while
'Cause, girl, you're amazing just the way you are, yeah

[Verse 1]
Easy come, easy go, that's just how you live, oh
Take, take, take it all, but you never give
Shoulda known you was trouble from the first kiss
Had your eyes wide open; why were they open? (Ooh)

[Pre-Chorus]
Gave you all I had and you tossed it in the trash
You tossed it in the trash, you did
To give me all your love is all I ever ask
'Cause what you don't understand is

[Chorus]
I'd catch a grenade for ya (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Throw my hand on a blade for ya (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
I'd jump in front of a train for ya (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
You know I'd do anything for ya (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Oh, oh-oh oh oh, I would go through all this pain
Take a bullet straight through my brain
Yes, I would die for ya baby
But you won't do the same

[Post-Chorus]
No, no, no, no, oh-oh oh...

[Verse 2]
Black, black, black and blue, beat me 'til I'm numb
Tell the devil I said "Hey" when you get back to where you're from
Mad woman, bad woman, that's just what you are
Yeah, you'll smile in my face then rip the brakes out my car

[Pre-Chorus]
Gave you all I had and you tossed it in the trash
You tossed it in the trash; yes, you did!
To give me all your love is all I ever ask
'Cause what you don't understand is

[Chorus]
I'd catch a grenade for ya (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Throw my hand on a blade for ya (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
I'd jump in front of a train for ya (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
You know I'd do anything for ya (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Oh, oh-oh oh oh, I would go through all this pain
Take a bullet straight through my brain
Yes, I would die for ya, baby
But you won't do the same

[Bridge]
If my body was on fire
Ooh, you'd watch me burn down in flames
You said you loved me, you're a liar
Cause you never, ever, ever did, baby

[Chorus]
But darlin', I'd still catch a grenade for ya (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Throw my hand on a blade for ya (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
I'd jump in front of a train for ya (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
You know I'd do anything for ya (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Oh, oh-oh oh-oh, I would go through all this pain

Turn the TV on, throw my hand in my pants
Nobody's gonna tell me I can't

Just chillin' in my Snuggie
Click to MTV, so they can teach me how to dougie
'Cause in my castle I'm the freaking man

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh oh, yes I said it
I said it, I said it, 'cause I can

[Chorus]
Today, I don't feel like doing anything
I just wanna lay in my bed
Don't feel like picking up my phone
So leave a message at the tone
'Cause today, I swear, I'm not doing anything
Nothing at all
Nothing at all

[Verse 2]
Tomorrow, I'll wake up, do some P90X
Meet a really nice girl, have some really nice sex
She's gonna scream out, "This is great!"
(Oh my god, this is great)
Yeah, I might mess around and get my college degree
I bet my old man will be so proud of me
But sorry pops, you'll just have to wait

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh oh, yes I said it
I said it, I said it, 'cause I can

[Chorus]
Today, I don't feel like doing anything
I just wanna lay in my bed
Don't feel like picking up my phone
So leave a message at the tone
'Cause today, I swear, I'm not doing anything

[Bridge]
No, I ain't gonna comb my hair
'Cause I ain't going anywhere
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no
I'll just strut in my birthday suit
And let everything hang loose
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Chorus]
Oh, today, I don't feel like doing anything
I just wanna lay in my bed
Don't feel like picking up my phone
So leave a message at the tone
'Cause today, I swear, I'm not doing anything
Nothing at all
Nothing at all

[Verse 1]
I know you're somewhere out there
Somewhere far away
I want you back, I want you back
My neighbors think I'm crazy
But they don't understand
You're all I have, you're all I have

[Pre-Chorus]
At night when the stars light up my room
I sit by myself...

[Chorus]
Talking to the moon
Trying to get to you
In hopes you're on the other side talking to me too
Or am I a fool, who sits alone, talking to the moon?

[Verse 2]
I'm feeling like I'm famous, the talk of the town
They say I've gone mad
Yeah, I've gone mad
But they don't know what I know
Cause when the sun goes down someone's talking back
Yeah, they're talking back, oh

[Pre-Chorus]
At night when the stars light up my room
I sit by myself...

[Chorus]
Talking to the moon
Trying to get to you
In hopes you're on the other side talking to me too
Or am I a fool, who sits alone, talking to the moon?

[Bridge]
Do you ever hear me calling?
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Cause every night, I'm talking to the moon

[Chorus]
Still trying to get to you
In hopes you're on the other side talking to me too
Or am I a fool, who sits alone, talking to the moon?

[Outro]
I know you're somewhere out there
Somewhere far away

[Verse 1]
I've made mistakes
I could have treated you better
I let you get away
There goes my happily ever after

[Pre-Chorus]
Tell me why, why can't we try and start again?
This can't be how our story ends
You're more than my girl, you're my best friend
Tell me you remember when
Ooh, when I was your man and you were my girl
It was you and me against the world

[Chorus]
Baby, ain't nobody gonna love me like the way you do
And you ain't never gonna find a love like mine
Tell me what can I do to make it up to you?
'Cause what we got's too good to say goodbye, goodbye

[Verse 2]
Yeah, I'm still in love with you darlin'
I know you feel the same
Oh, what's the point of both of us being broken-hearted?
I pray it's never too late

[Pre-Chorus]
So tell me, why, why can't we try and start again?
This can't be how our story ends
You're more than my girl, you're my best friend
Tell me you remember when
I was your man and you were my girl
It was you and me against the world

[Chorus]
Baby, ain't nobody gonna love me like the way you do
And you ain't never gonna find a love like mine
Tell me what can I do to make it up to you?
'Cause what we got's too good to say goodbye, goodbye

[Bridge]
(Oh, don't you give up)
Girl won't you listen?
(Don't you give up)
It's you that I'm missin'
(Don't you give up)
Take my hand, I wanna go, I wanna go
(All the way)
If we're gonna fight this fight for better days
I know we're gonna make it
This is the chance, let's take it

[Chorus]
Baby, ain't nobody gonna love me like the way you do
(No, no, no, no)
And you ain't never gonna find a love like mine
(Oh, tell me)
Tell me what can I do to make it up to you?
'Cause what we got's too good to say goodbye
(Come on, come on) goodbye (Oh baby, baby)
Baby, ain't nobody gonna love me like the way you do
And you ain't never gonna find a love like mine
(Oh, tell me)
Tell me what can I do to make it up to you?
'Cause what we got's too good to say goodbye, goodbye

[Verse 1]
If you ever leave me, baby
Leave some morphine at my door
'Cause it would take a whole lot of medication
To realize what we used to have
We don't have it anymore
There's no religion that could save me
No matter how long my knees are on the floor, oh
So keep in mind all the sacrifices I'm making
To keep you by my side
To keep you from walking out the door

[Chorus]
'Cause there'll be no sunlight
If I lose you, baby
There'll be no clear skies
If I lose you, baby
Just like the clouds
My eyes will do the same if you walk away
Everyday, it'll rain
Rain, rain

[Verse 2]
I'll never be your mother's favorite
Your daddy can't even look me in the eye
Ooh, if I was in their shoes, I'd be doing the same thing
Saying, "There goes my little girl
Walking with that troublesome guy"
But they're just afraid of something they can't understand
Ooh, but little darling watch me change their minds
Yeah, for you I'll try, I'll try, I'll try, I'll try
And pick up these broken pieces till I'm bleeding
If that'll make you mine

[Chorus]
'Cause there'll be no sunlight
If I lose you, baby
There'll be no clear skies
If I lose you, baby
Just like the clouds
My eyes will do the same if you walk away
Everyday, it'll rain
Rain, rain

[Bridge]
Ooh, don't you say (Don't you say)
Goodbye (Goodbye)
Don't you say (Don't you say)
Goodbye (Goodbye)
I'll pick up these broken pieces till I'm bleeding
If that'll make it right

[Chorus]
'Cause there'll be no sunlight
If I lose you, baby
And there'll be no clear skies
If I lose you, baby
And just like the clouds
My eyes will do the same if you walk away
Everyday, it'll rain
Rain, rain

[Chorus]
It's a beautiful night
We're looking for something dumb to do
Hey baby, I think I wanna marry you
Is it the look in your eyes, or is it this dancing juice?
Who cares, baby, I think I wanna to marry you

[Verse 1]
Well, I know this little chapel on the boulevard we can go
No one will know
Oh, come on, girl
Who cares if we're trashed
Got a pocket full of cash we can blow
Shots of patron
And it's on, girl

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't say no, no, no, no, no
Just say yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
And we'll go, go, go, go, go
If you're ready, like I'm ready

[Chorus]
Cause it's a beautiful night
We're looking for something dumb to do
Hey baby, I think I wanna marry you
Is it the look in your eyes, or is it this dancing juice?
Who cares, baby, I think I wanna marry you, oh

[Verse 2]
I'll go get a ring, let the choir bells sing, like ooh
So what you wanna do?
Let's just run girl
If we wake up and you wanna break up, that's cool
No, I won't blame you
It was fun, girl

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't say no, no, no, no, no
Just say yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
And we'll go, go, go, go, go
If you're ready, like I'm ready

[Chorus]
Cause it's a beautiful night
We're looking for something dumb to do
Hey baby, I think I wanna marry you
Is it the look in your eyes, or is it this dancing juice?
Who cares, baby, I think I wanna marry you, oh

[Bridge]
Just say, "I do..."
Tell me right now baby
Tell me right now baby, baby
Just say, "I do..."
Tell me right now baby
Tell me right now baby, baby

[Chorus]
Oh, it's a beautiful night
We're looking for something dumb to do
Hey baby, I think I wanna marry you
Is it the look in your eyes, or is it this dancing juice?
Who cares, baby, I think I wanna marry you

[Verse 1]
Ooh, I got a body full of liquor
With a cocaine kicker
And I'm feeling like I'm thirty feet tall
So lay it down, lay it down
You got your legs up in the sky
With the devil in your eyes
Let me hear you say you want it all
Say it now, say it now

[Pre-Chorus]
Look what you're doing
Look what you've done
But in this jungle you can't run
Cause what I got for you, I promise it's a killa
You'll be banging on my chest, bang bang, gorilla

[Chorus]
Ooh, yeah
You and me, baby, making love like gorillas
Ooh, yeah
You and me, baby, making love like gorillas

[Verse 2]
Yeah, I got a fistful of your hair
But you don't look like you're scared
You're just smiling, tell me "Daddy, it's yours"
Cause you know how I like it you's a dirty little lover
If the neighbors call the cops
Call the sheriff, call the SWAT, we don't stop
We keep rocking while they knocking on our door
And you're screaming, "Give it to me baby
Give it to me, motherfucker!"

[Pre-Chorus]
Look what you're doing
Look what you've done
But in this jungle you can't run
Cause what I got for you, I promise it's a killa
You'll be banging on my chest, bang bang, gorilla

[Chorus]
Ooh, yeah
You and me, baby, making love like gorillas
Ooh, yeah
You and me, baby, making love like gorillas

[Bridge]
I bet you never ever felt so good, so good
I got your body trembling like it should, it should
You'll never be the same, baby, once I'm done with
Yoo-oo-oo-oo-oou, yeah

[Breakdown]
You, you, you...

[Chorus]
Oho, you with me, baby, making love like gorillas
Oh, oh, oh, oh yeah
Yeah, you and me ,baby, we'll be fucking like gorillas
(Oh...)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, baby baby, aw, yeah
You and me baby, making love like gorillas

[Live Verse]
Girl, let me take my time, take my time, take my time, babe
I just want one smile, want one smile, want one smile, babe
Once I lay besides you, girl, I will make you scream, "yeah, yeah"
Girl, let me take my time, take my time, take my time, babe
I just want one smile, want one smile, want one smile, babe
Once I get inside you, girl, I will make you scream, "yeah, yeah, yeah"
Come on (etc.)
Yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse 1]
I got too many girls on hold for you to be so bold
Too many on my team for you to act so mean
You say you wanna go and have fun, well you ain't the only one
If I ring, don't let it ring too long or I'm gone

[Pre-Chorus]
I got Alicia waitin', Aisha waitin'
All the eesha's waitin' on me
So why you contemplatin'? Playa hatin'?
If this is how it's gonna be

[Chorus]
I'm calling all my lovelies (calling all my lovelies)
'Cause I can't get a hold of you
Since you ain't thinking of me (since you ain't thinking of me)
Oh, look what you're making me do

[Verse 2]
Honey pie, I'm far too fly to be on standby
Sendin' me straight to voicemail, suga, what the hell?
Oh, you ought to be ashamed, playin' these childish games
I don't get down like that, tell me where you at, hit me back

[Pre-Chorus]
I got Alicia waitin', Aisha waitin'
All the eesha's waitin' on me
So why you contemplatin'? Playa hatin'?

'Cause I can't get a hold of you
Since you ain't thinking of me (since you ain't thinking of me)
Oh, look what you're making me do

[Bridge]
Pick up the phone, pick up the phone
'Cause all this loving needs a home
Oh no, look at what you started, baby
Now I'm left here broken hearted, baby
There's a pain in my chest I cannot explain
I told myself I wasn't gon' cry
But somebody's gotta come dry these eyes 'cause

Hi, you've reached Halle Berry. Sorry I can't get to the phone right now but if you leave your name and number, I'll get right back to you

Damn...

[Chorus]
I'm calling calling calling calling all my lovelies

Look what you're making me do

[Outro]
Pick up the phone, pick up the phone
'Cause all this loving needs a home, oh

[Verse 1]
I spend all my money
On a big, old fancy car
For these bright-eyed honeys
Oh yeah, you know who you are
Keep me up 'til the sun is high
'Til the birds start calling my name
I'm addicted and I don't know why
Guess I've always been this way

[Pre-Chorus]
All these roads steer me wrong
But I still drive them all night long
All night long

[Chorus]
All you young, wild girls
You make a mess of me
Yeah, you young, wild girls
You'll be the death of me, the death of me
All you young, wild girls
No matter what you do
Yeah, you young, wild girls
I'll always come back to you, come back to you

[Verse 2]
I get lost under these lights
I get lost in the words I say
Start believing my own lies
Like everything will be okay
Oh I still dream of a simple life
Boy meets girl, makes her his wife
But love don't exist when you live like this
That much I know, yes I know

[Pre-Chorus]
All these roads steer me wrong
But I still drive them all night long
All night long

[Chorus]
All you young, wild girls
You make a mess of me
Yeah, you young, wild girls
You'll be the death of me, the death of me
All you young, wild girls
No matter what you do
Yeah, you young, wild girls
I'll always come back to you, come back to you

[Bridge]
You, you, you, you
Yeah you you you
You you you you

[Chorus]
All you young, wild girls
You make a mess of me
Yeah, you young, wild girls
You'll be the death of me, the death of me

Tryna keep it peaceful is a struggle for me
Don't pull up at 6 AM to cuddle with me
You know how I like it when you lovin' on me

Yes, I see the things that they wishin' on me
Hope I got some brothers that outlive me

Look, the new me is really still the real me
I swear you gotta feel me before they try and kill me
They gotta make some choices, they runnin' out of options
'Cause I've been goin' off and they don't know when it's stoppin'
And when you get to toppin', I see that you've been learnin'
And when you get to shoppin', you spend it like you earned it
And when you popped off on your ex he deserved it
I thought you were the one from the jump that confirmed it

[Intro]
You used to call me on my
You used to, you used to
Yeah

[Chorus]
You used to call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love
Call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love
And I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing
I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing

[Verse 1]
Ever since I left the city, you
Got a reputation for yourself now
Everybody knows and I feel left out
Girl, you got me down, you got me stressed out
‘Cause ever since I left the city, you
Started wearing less and goin' out more
Glasses of champagne out on the dance floor
Hangin' with some girls I've never seen before

[Chorus]
You used to call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love
Call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love
I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing
I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing

[Verse 2]
Ever since I left the city, you, you, you
You and me, we just don't get along
You make me feel like I did you wrong
Going places where you don't belong
Ever since I left the city, you
You got exactly what you asked for
Running out of pages in your passport
Hangin' with some girls I've never seen before

[Chorus]
You used to call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love
Call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love
And I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing
I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing

[Bridge]
These days, all I do is
Wonder if you're bendin' over backwards for someone else
Wonder if you're rolling up a Backwoods for someone else
Doing things I taught you, gettin' nasty for someone else
You don't need no one else
You don't need nobody else, no
Why you never alone?
Why you always touching road?
Used to always stay at home
Be a good girl, you was in the zone
Yeah, you should just be yourself
Right now, you're someone else

[Chorus]
You used to call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love
Call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love
And I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing
I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing

[Outro]
Ever since I left the city…

[Intro: Kyla]
Baby, I like your style

[Verse 1: Drake]
Grips on your waist, front way, back way
You know that I don't play
Streets not safe but I never run away
Even when I'm away
Oti, oti
There's never much love when we go OT
I pray to make it back in one piece
I pray, I pray

[Chorus: Drake]
That's why I need a one dance
Got a Hennessy in my hand
One more time 'fore I go
Higher powers taking a hold on me
I need a one dance
Got a Hennessy in my hand
One more time 'fore I go
Higher powers taking a hold on me

[Refrain: Kyla]
Baby, I like your style

[Verse 2: Drake]
Strength and guidance
All that I'm wishing for my friends
Nobody makes it from my ends
I had to bust up the silence
You know you gotta stick by me
Soon as you see the text, reply me
I don't wanna spend time fighting
We've got no time

[Chorus: Drake]
And that's why I need a one dance
Got a Hennessy in my hand
One more time 'fore I go
Higher powers taking a hold on me
I need a one dance
Got a Hennessy in my hand
One more time 'fore I go
Higher powers taking a hold on me

[Bridge: Wizkid]
Got a pretty girl and she love me long time
Wine it, wine it, very long time
Oh yeah, very long time
Back up, back up, back up and wine it
Back up, back up and wine it, girl
Back up, back up, back up and wine it
Oh yeah, very long time
Back, up, back up and wine it, girl

[Refrain: Kyla & Wizkid]
Tell me
I need to know, where do you wanna go?
Cause if you're down, I'll take it slow
Make you lose control
Where, where, where
Where, where, where, where
Oh yeah, very long time
Where, where, where
Back, up, back up and wine it, girl
Where, where, where, where
Cause if you're down
Back up, back up and
Cause if you're down
Back up, back up and
Cause if you're down
Back up, back up and

[Chorus: Drake]
I need a one dance
Got a Hennessy in my hand
One more time 'fore I go
Higher powers taking a hold on me
I need a one dance
Got a Hennessy in my hand
One more time 'fore I go
Higher powers taking a hold on me

[Verse: Drake]
I got my eyes on you
You're everything that I see
I want your hot love and emotion endlessly
I can't get over you
You left your mark on me
I want your hot love and emotion endlessly

[Pre-Hook: Drake]
'Cause you're a good girl and you know it
You act so different around me
'Cause you're a good girl and you know it
I know exactly who you could be

[Hook: Drake]
Just hold on, we're going home
Just hold on, we're going home
It's hard to do these things alone
Just hold on, we're going home

[Part 1]

[Intro]
Hol' it yute, hol' it, hol' it, hol' it, hol' it, hol' it
No sleepin' in the streets!
Shaky warrior
Yeah, this that Oliver, 40, Niko shit man
15 Fort York shit, y'know?
Boi-1da, what's poppin'?
Yeah, yeah

[Verse 1]
Runnin' through the 6 with my woes
Countin' money, you know how it goes
Pray the real live forever, man
Pray the fakes get exposed
I want that Ferrari, then I swerve
I want that Bugatti, just to hurt
I ain't rockin' my jewelry, that's on purpose
Niggas want my spot and don't deserve it
I don't like how serious they take themselves
I've always been me, I guess I know myself
Shakiness, man, I don't have no time for that
My city too turned up, I'll take the fine for that
This been where you find me at
That's been where you find me at
I know a nigga named Johnny Bling
He put me on to the finer things
Had a job sellin' Girbaud jeans
I had a yellow TechnoMarine
Then Kanye dropped, it was polos and backpacks
Man, that was when Ethan was pushin' a Subaru hatchback
Man, I'm talkin' way before hashtags
I was runnin' through the 6 with my woes
(Yeah!)

[Part 2]

[Beat Switch]

[Chorus]
I was runnin' through the 6 with my woes
You know how that should go
You know how that should go
You know how that should go
Runnin' through the 6 with my woes
You know how that should go
You know how that should go
You know how that should go
Don't fuck with them niggas, they too irrational, woah

[Verse 2]
This is that nasty flow
Top boy in this shit, I'm so international
Reps up is in here
Got P Reign and Chubby and TJ and Winnie and whoa
Yeah, and you know how that should go
I might declare it a holiday as soon as Baka get back on the road
Yeah, but you know how that should go
They so irrational, they don't wanna patch it up
They wanna mash it up, woah
My nigga Jibba, he whip it, I ride in the passenger
I'm way up, I stay up, I'm two up, I'm three up
I had to get back to you, woah
I'm turnin' into a nigga that thinks about money and women
Like 24/7, that's where my life took me
That's just how shit happened to go
And you know
Runnin' through the 6 with my, with my

[Chorus]
I was running through the 6 with my woes
And you know how that should go
You know how that should go
You know how that should go
Runnin' through the 6 with my woes
You know how that should go
You know how that should go
You know how that should go
Runnin' through the 6 with my woes
You know how that should go

[Outro: Popcaan & Drake]
...Shell out, all if yuh eye nuh big
Always haffi look out, yuh no know if yuh head book out
Dun know, a de Unruly boss, dis man

And if a boy nuh like OVO or Chromatic
Yuh can jus suck yuh mada!!
With no apology, if you nuh like we, we nuh like you neither youth
Your girl a say we cute, if you diss you will get execute
That's the truth, OVO Unruly
(Machine gun shots)
With my woes

[Intro]
Oh man
Oh man, oh man
Not again

[Verse 1]
Yeah, I learned the game from William Wesley, you can never check me
Back to back for the niggas that didn't get the message
Back to back, like I'm on the cover of Lethal Weapon
Back to back, like I'm Jordan '96, '97
Whoa—very important and very pretentious
When I look back, I might be mad that I gave this attention
Yeah, but it's weighin' heavy on my conscience
Yeah, and fuck, you left The Boy no options
I wanna see my niggas go insane
You gon' make me step out of my fuckin' frame
You gon' make me buy bottles for Charlamagne
You gon' make me go out of my fuckin' way
I waited four days, nigga, where y'all at?
I drove here in the Wraith playin' AR-AB
I'm not sure what it was that really made y'all mad
But I guess this is what I gotta do to make y'all rap
I mean whoa, can't fool the city, man, they know what's up
Second floor at Tootsies, gettin' shoulder rubs
This for y'all that think that I don't write enough
They just mad 'cause I got the Midas touch
You love her, then you gotta give the world to her
Is that a world tour or your girl's tour?
I know that you gotta be a thug for her
This ain't what she meant when she told you to open up more
Yeah, trigger fingers turn to Twitter fingers
Yeah, you gettin' bodied by a singin' nigga
I'm not the type of nigga that'll type to niggas
And shout-out to all my boss bitches wifin' niggas
Make sure you hit him with the prenup
Then tell that man to ease up
I did another one, I did another one
You still ain't did shit about the other one

[Chorus]
I got the drink in me going back to back
Yeah, going back to back
I got the drink in me going back to back
Yeah, I'm going back to back

[Verse 2]
I don't wanna hear about this ever again
Not even when she tell him that they better as friends
Not even when you saying, "Drizzy, tell 'em again!"
I been puttin' on a show, it was a sell-out event
Oh, you need better seatin'
I didn't wanna do it, gave me every reason
The point I'm tryin' to make is I don't ever need 'em
Seen what you'd do for fame, what would you do for freedom?
Please, check 'em for a wire or a earpiece
Please, please do not let these niggas near me
Please, think before you come for the great one
Please, who's a real nigga and who ain't one?
Please, somebody stop me
I'm talkin' boasy and gwanin wassy
I got the fest in five days and it's my shit
Soon as a nigga hit the stage, they gon'

[Chorus]
They gon' ask if I can play this shit back to back
Yeah, they want it back to back
They gon' ask if I can play this shit back to back
I took a break from Views, now it's back to that, nigga (Six)

[Intro: Aziz Ansari]
I'm really stepping up my game
These bitches gotta start paying me for this
Can't get no more free, Randy

[Chorus: Drake]
Got everything, I got everything
I cannot complain, I cannot
I don't even know how much I really made, I forgot, it's a lot
Fuck that, never mind what I got
Nigga don't watch that 'cause I—
Came up, that's all me, stay true, that's all me (yeah)
No help, that's all me, all me for real
Came up, that's all me, stay true, that's all me (2 Chainz)
No help, that's all me, all me for real

[Verse 1: 2 Chainz]
Money on my mind, you should think the same
J's on, pinky ring, dogging these hoes, I need quarantine
In the same league, but we don't ball the same
(Ah) She want all the fame, I hear that shit all the time
She said she love me, I said, "Baby girl, fall in line"
Okay, made a million off a dinner fork, watch me switch it up
Walked in, "Ill nigga alert! Ill nigga alert!"
You need that work, I got that work, got bitches in my condo
Just bought a shirt that cost a Mercedes-Benz car note
From the A to Toronto, we let the metal go off
And my dick so hard it make the metal detector go off
This that sauce, this that dressing
Givenchy, nigga, God bless you
If having a bad bitch was a crime, I'd be arrested(Tru)

[Chorus: Drake]
Got everything, I got everything
I cannot complain, I cannot
I don't even know how much I really made, I forgot, it's a lot
Fuck that, never mind what I got
Nigga don't watch that 'cause I—
Came up, that's all me, stay true, that's all me
No help, that's all me, all me for real
Came up, that's all me, stay true, that's all me
No help, that's all me, all me for real

[Verse 2: Drake]
I touched down in '86, knew I was the man by the age of 6
I even fucked the girl that used to babysit
But that was years later on some crazy shit
I heard your new shit, nigga hated it
Damon Wayans, homie don't play that shit
I get paid a lot, you get paid a bit
And my latest shit is like a greatest hits
God damn, ain't no wishing over on this side
Y'all don't fuck with us, then we don't fuck with y'all
It's no different over on this side
God damn, should I listen to everybody or myself?
'Cause myself just told myself:
"You're the motherfucking man, you don't need no help"
Cashing checks and I’m bigging up my chest
Y'all keep talking ‘bout who next, but I’m about as big as it gets
I swear y'all just wasting y'all breath
I’m the light skinned Keith Sweat, I'ma make it last forever
It’s not your turn 'cause I ain't done yet
Look, just understand that I'm on a roll like Cottonelle
I was made for all of this shit
And I’m on the road box office sales
I’m getting paid for all of this shit
Ask you to please excuse my table manners
I was making room for the table dancers
'Cause if we judging off your advances
Then I just got paid like eight advances, God damn!

[Chorus: Drake]
Got everything, I got everything
I cannot complain, I cannot
I don't even know how much I really made, I forgot, it's a lot
Fuck that, never mind what I got
Nigga don't watch that 'cause I—
Came up, that's all me, stay true, that's all me
No help, that's all me, all me for real
Came up, that's all me, stay true, that's all me—

[Verse 3: Big Sean]
Ho, shut the fuck up!
I got way too much on my mental
I learn from what I've been through
I'm finna do what I didn't do
And still waking up like the rent's due
Not complicated, it's simple
I got sexy ladies, a whole Benz-full
And to them hoes I'm everything—everything but gentle
But I still take my time, man, I guess I'm just old fashioned
Wearing retro shit, that's old fashion
Nigga, see what I'm saying, no closed caption
I paint pics, see the shit, good sex, need to hit
Keep a broad on the floor year 'round like season tickets
I plead the fifth, drink a fifth, load the nine
Leave you split, in the half, smoke a half, need a zip
My new girl is on Glee and shit
Probably making more money than me and shit
I swear to God I got 99 problems but a bitch ain't one
I got 99 problems, getting rich ain't one
Like I got trust issues
I'm sorry for the people I've pushed out
I'm the type to have a bullet-proof condom
And still gotta pull out
But that's just me and I ain't perfect
I ain't a saint but I am worth it
If it's one thing, I am worth it
Niggas still hating but it ain't working
Lil' bitch...

[Verse 4: Drake]
Oh me, oh me, oh my
I think I done fucked too many women from the 305
'Fore the end of this year
I'll do King of Diamonds 3 more times
Smoking on that kush all in our section
Like it's legalized
Girl, you can't always have your way
Sometimes it be like that
They don't really fuck with you like that
They ain't never did me like that
I just took my time, you got the shine
I let you eat like that
I been taught to never loan somebody
What you need right back
And I need that shit right back
(No more free Randy) I’m blessed than a muhfucka
Niggas been stressed than a muhfucka
Niggas getting nervous
Clutching they chests like a muhfucka
Damn that’s a motherfucker
Tell the truth, I don’t listen to you
'Cause I don’t like being lied to
And that ship won’t sail
And that wind won’t guide you
Daddy was in jail, we was talking through the window
Like a motherfucking drive-thru
That was back then, man
Now my niggas rich enough to do whatever I do

[Chorus]
I've been down so long, it look like up to me
They look up to me
I got fake people showin' fake love to me
Straight up to my face, straight up to my face
I've been down so long, it look like up to me
They look up to me
I got fake people showin' fake love to me
Straight up to my face, straight up to my face

[Verse 1]
Somethin' ain't right when we talkin'
Somethin' ain't right when we talkin'
Look like you hidin' your problems
Really you never was solid
No, you can't "son" me
You won't never get to run me
Just when shit look out of reach
I reach back like one, three
Like one, three, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
That's when they smile in my face
Whole time they wanna take my place
Whole time they wanna take my place
Whole time they wanna take my place
Yeah, I know they wanna take my place
I can tell that love is fake
I don't trust a word you say
How you wanna clique up after your mistakes?
Look you in the face, and it's just not the same

[Chorus]
I've been down so long, it look like up to me
They look up to me
I got fake people showin' fake love to me
Straight up to my face, straight up to my face
I've been down so long, it look like up to me
They look up to me
I got fake people showin' fake love to me
Straight up to my face, straight up to my face

[Verse 2]
Yeah, straight up to my face, tryna play it safe
Vibe switch like night and day
I can see it, like, right away
I came up, you changed up
I caught that whole play
Since, things never been the same

[Pre-Chorus]
That's when they smile in my face
Whole time they wanna take my place
Whole time they wanna take my place
Whole time they wanna take my place
Yeah, I know they wanna take my place
I can tell that love is fake (I can tell that love is fake)
I don't trust a word you say (I don't trust a word)
How you wanna clique up after your mistakes?
(That's just what I heard)
Look you in the face, and it's just not the same

[Chorus]
I've been down so long, it look like up to me
They look up to me
I got fake people showin' fake love to me
Straight up to my face, straight up to my face
I've been down so long, it look like up to me
They look up to me
I got fake people showin' fake love to me
Straight up to my face, straight up to my face

[Outro]
Skrrt
And more chune for your headtop
So watch how you speak on my name, you know?

[Intro: Jhené Aiko]
What's up? Been a minute since we kicked it
You've been caught up
With them bitches, I don't get it, you're a star love
You shouldn't have to deal with that
I'd never make you feel like that, 'cause...

[Chorus: Jhené Aiko]
I love me, I love me enough for the both of us
That's why you trust me
I know you been through more than most of us
So what are you? What are you, what are you so afraid of?
Darling you, you give but you cannot take love

[Verse 1: Drake]
Yeah, I needed to hear that shit, I hate when you're submissive
Passive aggressive when we're texting, I feel the distance
I look around the peers that surround me, these niggas tripping
I like when money makes a difference but don't make you different
Started realizing a couple places I could take it
I want to get back to when I was that kid in the basement
I want to take it deeper than money, pussy, vacation
And influence a generation that's lacking in patience
I've been dealing with my dad, speaking of lack of patience
Just me and my old man getting back to basics
We've been talking 'bout the future and time that we wasted
When he put that bottle down, girl that nigga's amazing
Well, fuck it, we had a couple Coronas
We might have rolled a white paper, just something to hold us
We even talked about you and our couple of moments
He said we should hash it out like a couple of grown ups
You a flower child, beautiful child, I'm in your zone
Looking like you came from the 70's on your own
My mother is 66 and her favorite line to hit me with is
Who the fuck wants to be 70 and alone?
You don't even know what you want from love anymore
I search for something I'm missing and disappear when I'm bored
But girl, what qualities was I looking for before?
Who you settling for? Who better for you than the boy, huh?

[Chorus: Jhené Aiko]
I love me, I love me enough for the both of us
That's why you trust me
I know you been through more than most of us
So what are you? What are you, what are you so afraid of?
Darling you, you give but you cannot take love

[Verse 2: Drake]
Uh, thinking 'bout Texas, back when Porscha used to work at Treasures
Or further back than that, before I had the Houston leverage
When I got Summer a Michael Kors with my momma's debit
A weak attempt at flexing, I'll never forget it
'Cause that night I played her three songs
Then we got to talking 'bout something we disagreed on
Then she start telling me how I'll never be as big as Trey Songz
Boy was she wrong, that was just negative energy for me to feed off
Now it's therapeutic blowing money in the Galleria
Or Beverly Center Macy's where I discovered Bria
Landmarks of the muses that inspired the music
When I could tell it was sincere without tryna prove it
The one that I needed was Courtney from Hooters on Peachtree
I've always been feeling like she was the piece to complete me
Now she engaged to be married, what's the rush on commitment?
Know we were going through some shit, name a couple that isn't
Remember our talk in the parking lot at the Ritz
Girl I felt like we had it all planned out, I guess I fucked up the vision
Learning the true consequences of my selfish decisions
When you find out how I'm living, I just hope I'm forgiven
It seem like you don't want this love anymore
I'm acting out in the open, it's hard for you to ignore
But girl, what qualities was I looking for before?
Who you settling for? Who better for you than the boy, huh?

[Chorus: Jhené Aiko]
I love me, I love me enough for the both of us
That's why you trust me
I know you been through more than most of us
So what are you? What are you, what are you so afraid of?
Darling you, you give but you cannot take love

[Outro: Baka]
"Been Baka aka Not Nice from time, G
Been a East Side ting
Scarborough ting from time, G
Been have up di ting dem from time, G
So I don't know what's wrong with these
Little wasteman out here eh?
Y'all need to know yourself."

[Part I: 0 to 100]

[Verse 1]
Fuck bein' on some chill shit
We go 0 to 100, nigga, real quick
They be on that rap-to-pay-the-bills shit
And I don't feel that shit, not even a little bit
Oh, Lord, know yourself, know your worth, nigga
My actions been louder than my words, nigga
How you so high, but still so down to Earth, nigga?
If niggas wanna do it, we can do it on they turf, nigga
Oh, Lord, I'm the rookie and the vet
Shoutout to the bitches out here holdin' down the set
All up in my phone, lookin' at pictures from the other night
She gon' be upset if she keep scrollin' to the left, dawg
She gon' see some shit that she don't wanna see
She ain't ready for it
If I ain't the greatest, then I'm headed for it
That mean I'm way up (Way up)
Yeah, the 6 ain't friendly but that's where I lay up
This shit a mothafuckin' lay-up
I been Steph Curry with the shot
Been cookin' with the sauce, Chef Curry with the pot, boy
360 with the wrist, boy
Ayy, who the fuck them niggas is, boy?
OVO, man, we really with the shits, boy
Yeah, really with the shits
I should prolly sign to Hit-Boy 'cause I got all the hits, boy
Fuck all that "Drake, you gotta chill" shit
I be on my Lil Mouse drill shit
Fuck all that rap-to-pay-your-bills shit
Yeah, I'm on some Raptors-pay-my-bills shit
All up on TV, I thought it'd make me richer
Wasn't payin' me enough, I needed somethin' quicker
So now I'm all in Niko basement puttin' work in on the phones
Either that or drive to Money Mart to make the pickups
Man, it's 2008, I'm tryna paint the picture
Comeback Season in the works and now I'm thinkin' bigger
I got 40 in the studio, every night, late night
Gotta watch that shit, don't want to make him sicker
That's my nigga
Oh, Lord, got a whole lot to show for it
I mean, we can really get it, we can go for it
I'm just here for the bucks and the billis, nigga
Don't make me kill one of the GOATs for it
I run this shit, they like, "Go Forrest
Run Forrest, run Forrest, go Forrest"
Yeah, I mean you already wrote for us
Damn, nigga, what's one more quote for us?
Oh, Lord, who else soundin' like this?
They ain't make me what I am, they just found me like this
I was ready... fuck that, I've been ready
Since my dad used to tell me
He was comin' to the house to get me
He ain't show up
Valuable lesson, man, I had to grow up
That's why I never ask for help
I'll do it for you niggas and do it for myself

[Outro]
I go 0 to 100, nigga, real quick
Real quick, whole squad on that real shit
0 to 100, nigga, real quick
Real quick, real fuckin' quick, nigga
0 to 100, nigga, real quick

[Part II: The Catch Up]

[Bridge]
Whole squad on that real shit
Whole squad on that real shit
Whole squad on that real shit, yeah

[Verse 2]
The other night
Lavish Lee told me that I'm all these people listen to
She said they love me unconditional
Imagine how it feel to watch another nigga at the top
You know that if you wasn't you, you would be dissin' you, dawg
Damn, okay, from that perspective
I see what you're talkin' 'bout, no way to soften that
'Cause me, I was tryna find out where I lost 'em at
But maybe I ain't lose 'em at all
Maybe I keep movin' forward and they're just stagnant
They ain't movin' at all
But when they need a favor, who do they call?
Maybe I'm searchin' for the problems
Askin' what was said and who was involved
Too focused on people's feedback and provin' 'em wrong
They say the shoe can always fit, no matter whose foot it's on
These days feel like I'm squeezin' in 'em
Whoever wore 'em before just wasn't thinkin' big enough
I'm 'bout to leave 'em with 'em
'Cause if I run in the game in these, man, the seams are splittin'
No pun intended but they're smellin' defeat in the air
Headed where nobody took it, who meetin' me there?
They tell him that he's talkin' crazy but he doesn't care
Bein' humble don't work as well as bein' aware
Listen up, boy, you're better off eavesdroppin'
We already got spring 2015 poppin'
PND droppin', Reps-up P droppin'
Majid Jordan droppin', OB droppin', not to mention me droppin'
Feel like we paid the refs off, man, we fixed the game
Me and Noel been at it before Twitter names
Yeah, been on the move like the lease is up
And I can't even name one person that's keepin' up
Damn, fuck how it was in the past tense
Ask yourself, how do we match up now?
'Cause I'm only 27 and I'm only gettin' better
If I haven't passed you yet, watch me catch up now, for real

[Outro: James Blake]
Could it be the way that I'll catch up
Could it be the way that I'll catch up
Could it be the way that I'll catch up
Could it be the way that I'll catch up
Could it be the way that I'll catch up
Could it be the way that I'll catch up
Could it be the way that I'll catch up
Could it be the way that I'll catch up
Could it be the way that I'll catch up

[Verse 1: Drake]
I'm the fuckin' man, y'all don't get it, do ya?
Type of money, everybody acting like they knew ya
Go Uptown, New York City, bitch
Them Spanish girls love me like I'm Aventura
Tell Uncle Luke I'm out in Miami, too
Clubbing hard, fucking women, there ain't much to do
Wrist bling, got a condo up in Biscayne
Still getting brain from a thang, ain't shit changed
How you feel, how you feel, how you feel?
25, sitting on 25 mill', uh
I'm in the building and I'm feeling myself
Rest in peace, Mac Dre, I'ma do it for the Bay
Okay, getting paid, we'll holler whenever that stop
My team good, we don't really need a mascot
Tell Tune, "Light one, pass it like a relay"
YMCMB, you niggas more YMCA
Me, Franny, and Mally Mall at the crib-o
Shout goes out to Niko, J and Chubbs, shouts to Gibbo
We got Santa Margherita by the liter
She know even if I'm fucking with her, I don't really need her
Aww, that's how you feel, man? That's really how you feel?
'Cause the pimpin' ice cold, all these bitches wanna chill
I mean maybe she won't but then again maybe she will
I can almost guarantee she know the deal, real nigga, what's up?

[Chorus: Drake]
Now she want a photo, you already know, though
You only live once: that's the motto, nigga, YOLO
And we bout it every day, every day, every day
Like we sittin on the bench, nigga, we don't really play
Every day, every day, fuck what anybody say
Can't see 'em 'cause the money in the way, real nigga, what's up?

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
One...time? Fuck one time
I'm calling niggas out like the umpire
Seven...grams in the blunt
Almost drowned in her pussy so I swam to her butt
It's Eastside, we in this bitch
Wish a nigga would, like a tree in this bitch
And if a leaf fall put some weed in that bitch
That's my MO, add a B to that shit
I'm fucked up, tore down
I'm twisted: doorknob
Talk stupid? Off with your head!
Nigga, money talks, and Mr. Ed, yeah
I'm so Young Money
Got a drum on the gun, Energizer bunny
Funny how honey ain't sweet like sugar
Ain't shit sweet? Niggas on the street like hookers
I tongue kiss her other tongue
Skeet skeet skeet: water gun
Oh my God, Becky, look at her butt! Tunechi

[Chorus: Drake]
Now she want a photo, you already know, though
You only live once: that's the motto, nigga, YOLO
And we bout it every day, every day, every day
Like we sittin on the bench, nigga, we don't really play
Every day, every day, fuck what anybody say
Can't see 'em 'cause the money in the way, real nigga, what's up?
Now she want a photo, you already know, though
You only live once: that's the motto, nigga, YOLO
And we bout it every day, every day, every day
Like we sittin on the bench, nigga, we don't really play
Every day, every day, fuck what anybody say
Can't see 'em 'cause the money in the way, real nigga, what's up?

[Verse 1]
I done kept it real from the jump
Livin' at my momma's house, we'd argue every month
Nigga, I was tryna get it on my own
Workin' all night, traffic on the way home
And my uncle callin' me, like, "Where you at?
I gave you the keys, told you bring it right back”
Nigga, I just think it's funny how it goes
Now I'm on the road, half a million for a show, and we—

[Chorus]
Started from the bottom, now we're here
Started from the bottom, now my whole team fuckin' here
Started from the bottom, now we're here
Started from the bottom, now the whole team here, nigga

Started from the bottom, now the whole team here, nigga

[Verse 2]
Boys tell stories 'bout the man
Say I never struggled, wasn't hungry, yeah, I doubt it
Nigga, I could turn your boy into the man
There ain't really much out here that's poppin' off without us
Nigga, we just want the credit where it's due
I'ma worry 'bout me, give a fuck about you
Nigga, just as a reminder to myself
I wear every single chain, even when I'm in the house
Cause we—

[Chorus]
Started from the bottom, now we're here
Started from the bottom, now my whole team fuckin' here
Started from the bottom, now we're here

[Bridge]
No new niggas, nigga, we don't feel that
Fuck a fake friend, where your real friends at?
We don't like to do too much explainin'
Story stayed the same, I never changed it
No new niggas, nigga, we don't feel that
Fuck a fake friend, where your real friends at?
We don't like to do too much explainin'
Story stayed the same through the money and the fame
Cause we—

[Chorus]
Started from the bottom, now we're here
Started from the bottom, now my whole team fuckin' here
Started from the bottom, now we're here
Started from the bottom, now the whole team here, nigga

[Intro: Jimmy Smith]
Good God Almighty—like back in the old days...
You know, years ago they had the A&R men to tell you what to play, how to play it and you know whether it's disco and rock but we just went in the studio and we did it. We had the champagne in the studio, of course—compliments of the company—and we just laid back and did it. So we hope you enjoy listening to this album half as much as we enjoyed playing it for you. Because we had a ball. Only real music is gonna last—all the other bullshit is here today and gone tomorrow...

[Chorus: Timbaland]
Cash rules everything around me, frikki-frikki-frik
C.R.E.A.M.; get the-get the-get the-get the
Get the-get the-get the-get the money, dollar-dollar
D-d-d-d-dollar-dollar, dollar-dollar bill y'all (y'all, y'all)
Cash rules everything around me, frikki-frikki-frik
C.R.E.A.M.; get the-get the-get the-get the
Get the-get the-get the-get the money, dollar-dollar
D-d-d-d-dollar-dollar, dollar-dollar bill y'all (y'all, y'all)

[Verse 1: Drake]
Yeah
Uh, after hours at Il Mulino
Or Sotto Sotto, just talkin' women and vino
The contract like '91 Dan Marino
I swear this guy Michael Rapino's boosting my ego
Overly focused, it's far from the time to rest now
Debates growin' 'bout who they think is the best now
Took a while, got the jokers out of the deck now
I'm holdin' all the cards and niggas wanna play chess now
I hear you talking, say it twice so I know you meant it
Fuck it, I don't even tint it, they should know who's in it
I'm authentic, real name, no gimmicks
No game, no scrimmage, I ain't playin' with you niggas at all
My classmates, they went on to be chartered accountants
Or work with their parents
But thinkin' back on how they treated me
My high school reunion might be worth an appearance
Make everybody have to go through security clearance
Tables turn, bridges burn, you live and learn
With the ink I could murder, word to my nigga Irv
Yeah, I swear shit just started clickin' dog
You know it's real when you are who you think you are

[Chorus: Timbaland]
Cash rules everything around me, frikki-frikki-frik
C.R.E.A.M.; get the-get the-get the-get the
Get the-get the-get the-get the money, dollar-dollar
D-d-d-d-dollar-dollar, dollar-dollar bill y'all (y'all, y'all)
Cash rules everything around me, frikki-frikki-frik
C.R.E.A.M.; get the-get the-get the-get the
Get the-get the-get the-get the money, dollar-dollar
D-d-d-d-dollar-dollar, dollar-dollar bill y'all (y'all, y'all)

[Verse 2: JAY-Z]
Uh, I had Benzes 'fore you had braces
The all-black Maybach but I'm not a racist
Inside's whiter than Katy Perry's face is
Yellow diamonds in my Jesús
I just might learn to speak Mandarin
Japanese for the yen that I'm handlin'
International Hov, that's my handle
My saint's Changó, light a candle
El Gran Santo on the mantle
Case y'all didn't know, I speak Spanish too, uh
Shout out to World Wide Wes
Everywhere we go, we leave a worldwide mess
Yes, still Roc La Familia
Says a lot about you if you not feeling us
The homie said "Hov, it ain't many of us"
I told 'em "Less is more, nigga, is plenty of us"

[Chorus: Timbaland]
Cash rules everything around me, frikki-frikki-frik
C.R.E.A.M.; get the-get the-get the-get the
Get the-get the-get the-get the money, dollar-dollar
D-d-d-d-dollar-dollar, dollar-dollar bill y'all (y'all, y'all)

[Verse 3: JAY-Z]
Cake, cake-cake, cake-cake, cake
500 million, I got a pound cake
Niggas is frontin', that's upside-down cake
Get 'em a red nose, they clown cakes
They shoulda never let you 'round cake
Look at my neck, I got a karat cake, uh
Now here's the icin' on the cake
Cake, cake-cake, cake-cake, uhh
I'm just gettin' started, oh, yeah, we got it bitch
I've done made more millionaires than the lotto did
Dame made millions, Biggs made millions
Ye made millions, Just made millions
Lyor made millions, Cam made millions
Beans'a tell you if he wasn't in his feelings
Uh, I'm back in my bag
My eyes bloodshot but my jet don't lag
A pair of Jordan 3's tryna chase this cash
Gucci airbag just in case we crash
Uh, last night was mad trill
I'm fresh out of Advil, Jesus grab the wheel

[Part 2: Paris Morton Music 2, Produced by Detail]

[Verse 4: Drake]
Yeah, uh
Look, fuck all that "Happy to be here" shit that y'all want me on
I'm the big homie, they still be tryna lil bro me, dog
Like I should fall in line, like I should alert niggas
When I'm 'bout to drop somethin' crazy
And not say I'm the greatest of my generation
Like I should be dressing different
Like I should be less aggressive and pessimistic
Like I should be way more nervous and less dismissive
Like I should be on my best behavior and not talk my shit
And do it major like the niggas who paved the way for us
Like I didn't study the game to the letter
And understand that I'm not doin' it the same
Man, I'm doing it better
Like I didn't make that clearer this year
Like I should feel, I don't know, guilty for saying that
They should put a couple more mirrors in here
So I can stare at myself
These are usually just some thoughts
That I would share with myself
But I thought "Fuck it", it's worth it to share 'em
With someone else other than Paris for once
I text her from time to time, she a mom now
I guess sometimes life forces us to calm down
I told her she could live with me if she need to
I got a compound but I think she's straight
'Cause she supported since Hot Beats
Right before Wayne came and got me
Out of the back room where I was rapping with Jas
Over beats that I shouldn't have in the hopes for the glory
He walked right past in the hallway
Three months later, I'm his artist
He probably wouldn't remember that story
But that shit stick with me always
Couldn't believe when he called me
You never know what could happen to you
And I just spent four Ferraris all on a brand new Bugatti
And did that shit 'cause it's somethin' to do
Yeah, I guess that's just who I became, dawg
Nothing was the same, dawg

[Intro: Drake]
Gotta do what I gotta do, yeah

[Verse 1: Drake]
All my exes live in Texas like I'm George Strait
Or they go to Georgia State where, tuition is handled
By some random nigga that live in Atlanta
That she only see when she feels obligated
Admitted it to me the first time we dated
But she was no angel, and we never waited
I took her for sushi, she wanted to fuck
So we took it to go, told 'em don't even plate it
And we never talk too much after I blew up
Just only "hello" or a "happy belated"
And I think I text her and told her I made it
And that's when she text me and told me she prayed it
And that's when I text her and told her I love her
Then right after texted and told her I'm faded
She asked what have I learned since getting richer
I learned workin' with the negatives could make for better pictures
I learned Hennessy and enemies is one hell of a mixture
Even though it's fucked up, girl I'm still fucking with ya
Damn, is it the fall, time for me to revisit the past
There's women to call, there's albums to drop, there's liquor involved
There's stories to tell, we been through it all (Damn)
Interviews are like confessions
Get the fuck up out my dressing room, confusing me with questions like

[Pre-Chorus: Lil Wayne]
Do you love this shit? Are you high right now?
Do you ever get nervous?
Are you single? I heard you fucked your girl, is it true?
You getting money?
You think them niggas you with is with you?

[Chorus: Lil Wayne]
And I say hell yeah, hell yeah, hell yeah
Fuckin' right, fuckin' right, alright
And we say hell yeah, hell yeah, hell yeah
Fuckin' right, fuckin' right, alright

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
Uhh, so much for being optimistic
They say love is in the air, so I
Hold my breath until my face turn purple
Keep a few bad bitches in my circle
My nuts hang like ain't no curfew
Bitch, if you wave, then I will surf you
I flew jet, she flew commercial
But we still met later that night
After my session, she came over
I was aggressive and she was sober
I gave her a pill, she started confessing
And started undressing and ask me to hold her
And so I did, but that was last month
And now she's texting me asking for closure
Damn, she say this shit gon' catch up to me, I keep tissue paper
We eat each other whenever we at the dinner table
She say she hate that she love me and she wish I was average
Shit, sometimes I wish the same and I wish she wasn't married
Promises, I hope I never break 'em
Met a female dragon, had a fire conversation
But, interviews are like confessions
Get the fuck up out my bedroom, confusing me with questions like

[Pre-Chorus: Lil Wayne]
Do you love this shit? Are you high right now?
Do you ever get nervous?
Are you single? I heard you fucked your girl, is it true?
You getting money?
You think them niggas you with is with you?

[Chorus: Lil Wayne & Drake]
And I say hell yeah, hell yeah, hell yeah
Fuckin' right, fuckin' right, alright
And we say hell yeah, hell yeah, hell yeah
Fuckin' right, damn right, alright
And we say hell yeah, hell yeah, hell yeah
Fuckin' right, fuckin' right, alright
And we say hell yeah, hell yeah, hell yeah
Fuckin' right, damn right, alright, yeah

[Outro: Drake]
Yeah, yeah, oh-yeah, oh-yeah

[Intro: Ericka Lee on the phone]
Hello? Yeah, I just walked in
Yeah, I'm good… You still working?
Tonight… Right now? Did I go out?
Yeah, I went out, I went…
I went to a couple of clubs
I never went to bed, shit…
Wine or water
You said something about a cold drink?
I don't know, I'm delirious…

[Verse 1: Drake]
Cups of the rosé
Bitches in my old phone
I should call one and go home
I've been in this club too long
The woman that I would try
Is happy with a good guy
But I've been drinkin' so much
That I'ma call her anyway, and say…

[Chorus: Drake]
Fuck that nigga that you love so bad
I know you still think about the times we had
I say fuck that nigga that you think you found
And since you picked up, I know he's not around

[Bridge: Drake & Ericka Lee]
(Are you drunk right now?)
I'm just sayin' you could do better
Tell me, have you heard that lately?
I'm just sayin' you could do better
And I'll start hatin' only if you make me

[Verse 2: Drake]
Uh, cups of the XO
All my people been here
I see all of her friends here
Guess she don't have the time to kick it no more
Flights in the morning
What you doin' that's so important?
I've been drinkin' so much
That I'ma call you anyway, and say…

[Chorus: Drake]
Fuck that nigga that you love so bad
I know you still think about the times we had
I say fuck that nigga that you think you found
And since you picked up, I know he's not around

[Bridge: Drake & Ericka Lee]
(Are you drunk right now?)
I'm just sayin' you could do better
Tell me, have you heard that lately?
I'm just sayin' you could do better
And I'll start hatin' only if you make me

[Verse 3: Drake]
I think I'm addicted to naked pictures
And sitting talking 'bout bitches that we almost had
I don't think I'm conscious of makin' monsters
Outta the women I sponsor 'til it all goes bad
But, shit, it's all good
We threw a party, yeah, we threw a party
Bitches came over, yeah, we threw a party
I was just calling, ‘cause they were just leavin'
Talk to me, please, don't have much to believe in
I need you right now, are you down to listen to me?
Too many drinks have been given to me
I got some women that's livin' off me
Paid for their flights and hotels, I'm ashamed
Bet that you know them, I won't say no names
After a while, girl, they all seem the same
I've had sex four times this week; I'll explain
Havin' a hard time adjustin' to fame
Sprite in that mixture
I've been talkin' crazy, girl, I'm lucky that you picked up
Lucky that you stayed on
I need someone to put this weight on
"Well, I'm sorry."

[Bridge: Drake & Ericka Lee]
(Are you drunk right now?)
I'm just sayin' you could do better
Tell me, have you heard that lately?
I'm just sayin' you could do better
And I'll start hatin' only if you make me

[Interlude: Drake]
You're not gonna come?
Guess I'm 'bout to just kick it here then

[Outro: Drake]
Just throw up while I hold your hair back
Her white friend said, "You niggas crazy"
I hope no one heard that
I hope no one heard that
‘Cause if they did, we gonna be in some trouble
We gonna be in some trouble, trouble

[Intro: Big Freedia]
I wanna know who mothafuckin' representin' in here tonight

Give to me, give to me, why won't you live for me?

[Verse 1: Drake]
Everybody get your mothafuckin' roll on

Had a man last year, life goes on
Haven't let that thing loose, girl, in so long
You've been inside, know you like to lay low
I've been peepin' what you bringin' to the table
Workin' hard, girl, everything paid for
First-last, phone bill, car note, cable
With your phone out, gotta hit them angles
With your phone out, snappin' like you Fabo
And you showin' off, but it's alright
And you showin' off, but it's alright (Alright!)
It's a short life, yeah

You gotta be nice for what to these niggas?

[Verse 2: Drake]
I understand, you got a hunnid bands
You got a baby Benz, you got some bad friends
High school pics, you was even bad then
You ain't stressin' off no lover in the past tense
You already had them
Work at 8 A.M., finish 'round five
Hoes talk down, you don't see 'em outside
Yeah, they don't really be the same offline
You know dark days, you know hard times
Doin' overtime for the last month
Saturday, call the girls, get 'em gassed up
Gotta hit the club, gotta make that ass jump
Gotta hit the club like you hit them mothafuckin' angles
With your phone out, snappin' like you Fabo
And you showin' off, but it's alright
And you showin' off, but it's alright (Alright!)
It's a short life

Ayy, y’all get some more drinks goin' on
I'll sound a whole lot better

[Verse 1]
Listen
Seein' you got ritualistic
Cleansin' my soul of addiction for now
'Cause I'm fallin' apart, yeah
Tension
Between us just like picket fences
You got issues that I won’t mention for now
’Cause we're fallin’ apart

[Chorus]
Passionate from miles away
Passive with the things you say
Passin' up on my old ways
I can't blame you, no, no
Passionate from miles away
Passive with the things you say
Passin' up on my old ways
I can’t blame you, no, no

[Verse 2]
Listen
Harder buildin' trust from a distance
I think we should rule out commitment for now
'Cause we're fallin' apart
Leavin'
You're just doing that to get even
Don't pick up the pieces, just leave it for now
They keep fallin' apart

[Chorus]
Passionate from miles away
Passive with the things you say
Passin' up on my old ways
I can't blame you, no, no
Passionate from miles away
Passive with the things you say
Passin' up on my old ways
I can't blame you, no, no

[Outro: Zoë Kravitz]
Um, trying to think of the right thing to say

[Intro]
Breaking news, my niggas
If your girlfriend has went to any
Season opener basketball game
Best believe, she's fucking some niggas on that team
She's fucking somebody on the basketball team
If she's at the game
Right, right, yeah

[Chorus: Drake]
I say bounce that shit like woah
Yeah, bounce that shit like woah
This is not a fairytale, I already know how you like it
Take you to the mall and get you a new outfit
Girl, that's just some child's play
Bounce that shit like woah, woah, woah
Woah, woah, heard all of the stories about you
I already know and I like it
Take you to the mall and get you a new outfit
Girl, that's just some child's play
Bounce that shit like woah, yeah
Bounce that shit like woah

[Verse 1: Drake]
Why you gotta fight with me at Cheesecake?
You know I love to go there
Say I'm actin' lightskin, I can't take you nowhere
This a place for families that drive Camrys and go to Disney
They don't need to know all of our business
You wildin', you super childish, you go to CVS for Kotex
In my Bugatti, I took the key and tried to hide it
So you can't drive it, and put on mileage
Then you find it, awkward silence
Momma is a saint, yes, she raised me real good
All because of her I don't do you like I should
Don't make me give you back to the hood
Don't make me give you back

[Chorus: Drake]
I say bounce that shit like woah
Yeah, bounce that shit like woah
This is not a fairytale, I already know how you like it
Take you to the mall and get you a new outfit
Girl that's just some child's play
Bounce that shit like woah, woah, woah
Woah, woah, heard all of the stories about you
I already know and I like it
Take you to the mall and get you a new outfit
Girl, that's just some child's play
Bounce that shit like woah, yeah
Bounce that shit like woah

[Refrain 1: Drake & Ha-Sizzle]
Yeah, rode that dick like a soldier
She rode it like a soldier
She rode it like a jungle soldier
She rode it like a, yeah, yeah
I got it, yeah

[Verse 2: Drake]
You don't wanna fall in love, I know
I'm not someone you should trust, I know
I give Chanel out like a hug, I know
I knew a couple of your friends way before
How many girls have slept in this bed?
Say a different number than the one that's in my head
Lying to protect you, I be doing that a lot
My past checkered like the Louis you just got
Married in our twenties, now, where the fun in that?
My city love me like a college running back
Pack a bag, you gon' end up staying where I'm at
Took you from the hood and I could never give you back
I just wanna let you know that someone love you back
All the Cadillac like I'm Teddy Pendergrass
Whippin' on this shit, I'm getting ready, where you at?
Riding...

[Refrain 2: Ha-Sizzle]
She rode that dick like a soldier
She rode it like a soldier
She rode it like a Melpomene soldier
She rode that dick like a soldier

She rode it like a jungle soldier
Rode that dick like a soldier
She rode it like a soldier
She rode it like a Melpomene soldier

You requested it, so we rewind

Got a lot of people tryna drain me of my energy

I got girls in real life tryna fuck up my day
Fuck goin' online, that ain't part of my day
I got real shit poppin' with my family too
I got niggas that can never leave Canada too
I got two mortgages, thirty million in total
I got niggas that'll still try fuckin' me over
I got rap niggas that I gotta act like I like
But my actin' days are over, fuck them niggas for life, yeah

[Chorus]
I got enemies,  got a lot of enemies
Got a lot of people tryna drain me of this energy
They tryna take the wave from a nigga
Fuckin' with the kid and pray for your nigga

[Verse 2: Drake]
I got people talkin' down, man, like I give a fuck
I bought this one a purse, I bought this one a truck
I bought this one a house, I bought this one a mall
I keep buyin' shit, just make sure you keep track of it all
I got bitches askin' me about the code for the Wi-Fi
So they can talk about they Timeline
And show me pictures of they friends
Just to tell me they ain't really friends
Ex-girl, she the female version of me
I got strippers in my life, but they virgins to me
I hear everybody talkin' 'bout what they gon' be
I got high hopes for you niggas, we gon' see
I got money in the courts 'til all my niggas are free
'Bout to call your ass a Uber, I got somewhere to be
I hear fairy tales 'bout how they gon' run up on me
Well, run up when you see me, then, and we gon' see

[Chorus]
I got enemies,  got a lot of enemies
Got a lot of people tryna drain me of this energy
They tryna take the wave from a nigga
Fuckin' with the kid and pray for your nigga

[Verse 3: Drake]
Nah, fuck all of you niggas, I ain't finished
Y'all don't wanna hear me say it's a go
Y'all don't wanna see Win Win, 50 or Whoa
I got real ones livin' past Kennedy Road
I got real ones wit' me everywhere that I go
I'm tryna tell ya I got enemies, got a lot of enemies
Every time I see 'em, somethin' wrong with their memory
Tryna take the wave from a nigga
So tired of savin' all these niggas, mayne
Yeah, run 'em

[Chorus]
I got enemies, got a lot of enemies
Got a lot of people tryna drain me of this energy
They tryna take the wave from a nigga
Fuckin' with the kid and pray for your nigga
(I'm off this)
