[Verse 1]
So you're still thinking of me
Just like I know you should
I can not give you everything, you know I wish I could
I'm so high at the moment
I'm so caught up in this
Yeah, we're just young, dumb and broke
But we still got love to give

[Chorus]
While we're young dumb
Young, young dumb and broke
Young dumb
Young, young dumb and broke
Young dumb
Young dumb
Young, young dumb and broke
Young dumb broke high school kids
Yadadadadadadada
Yadadadadadada
Yadadadadadadada
Young dumb broke high school kids

[Verse 2]
We have so much in common
We argue all the time
You always say I'm wrong
I'm pretty sure I'm right
What's fun about commitment?
When we have our life to live
Yeah, we're just young dumb and broke
But we still got love to give

[Chorus]
While we're young dumb
Young, young dumb and broke
Young dumb
Young, young dumb and broke
Young dumb
Young, young dumb and broke
Young dumb broke high school kids
Yadadadadadadada
Yadadadadadada
Yadadadadadadada
Young dumb broke high school kids

[Bridge]
Jump and we think - do it all in the name of love
Love
Run into sin, do it all in the name of fun
Fun
Whoa-oa-oa
I'm so high at the moment
I'm so caught up in this
Yeah, we're just young, dumb and broke
But we still got love to give

[Chorus]
While we're young dumb
Young, young dumb and broke
Young dumb
Young, young dumb and broke
Young dumb
Young dumb
Young, young dumb and broke
Young dumb broke high school kids
Yadadadadadadada
Yadadadadadada
Yadadadadadadada
Young dumb broke high school kids

[Chorus]
Send me your location, let's
Focus on communicating
'Cause I just need the time and place to come through (place to come through)
Send me your location
Let's ride the vibrations
I don't need nothing else but you
(do not need nothing else but you)

[Verse 1]
At times I wonder why I fool with you
But this is new to me, this is new to you
Initially, I didn't wanna fall for you
Gather my attention it was all for you, so don't
Take advantage, don't leave my heart damaged
I understand that things go a little bit better when you plan it... oh, so won't

[Chorus]
Send me your location, let's
Focus on communicating
'Cause I just need the time and place to come through
Send me your location
Let's ride the vibrations
I don't need nothing else but you
(I don't need nothing else but you)

[Verse 2]
I don't wanna fall in love off of subtweets, so
Let's get personal
I got a lot of cool spots that we can go
Tell me what's the move and I got you
I'm only acting like this 'cause I like you
Just give me the vibe to slide in
Oh, I might make you mine by the night, and

[Chorus]
Send me your location, let's
Focus on communicating
'Cause I just need the time and place to come through (place to come through)
Send me your location
Let's ride the vibrations
I don't need nothing else but you
(I don't need nothing else but you)

[Outro]
Ride, ride, ride, come and vibe with me tonight
I don't need nothing else but you
(I don't need nothing else but you)
Ride, ride, ride, come and vibe with me tonight
I don't need nothing else but you
Nothing else but you
Do, do, do, do, do, do
Oh, oh, mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, mmm, mmm, mmm
Do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do
Do, do, do, do, do, do, do
I don't need nothing else but you

[Intro]
Better
Nothing, baby
Nothing feels better
I'm not really drunk, I never get that fucked up
I'm not, I'm so sober

[Verse 1]
Love to see you shine in the night like the diamond you are
(Love to see you shine in the night like the diamond you are)
I'm good on the side, it's alright, just hold me in the dark
(I'm good on the side, it's alright, just hold me in the dark)
No one's gotta know what we do, hit me up when you're bored
(No one's gotta know what we do, hit me up when you're bored)
'Cause I live down the street
So we meet when you need and it's yours
All I hear is...

[Chorus]
Nothing feels better than this
Nothing feels better
Nothing feels better than this
Nothing feels better, oh no
We don't gotta hide, this is what you like
I'll admit
Nothing feels better than this

[Verse 2]
You say we're just friends but I swear when nobody's around
(You say we're just friends but I swear when nobody's around)
You keep my hand around your neck, we connect, are you feeling it now?
(You keep my hand around your neck, we connect, are you feeling it now?)
'Cause I am
I got so high the other night, I swear to God, felt my feet lift the ground
(I got so high the other night, I swear to God I felt my feet lift the ground)
Ooh, yeah
Your back against the wall, this is all you've been talking about
In my ears

[Chorus]
Nothing feels better than this
Nothing feels better
Nothing feels better than this
Nothing feels better, oh no
We don't gotta hide, this is what you like
I admit
Nothing feels better than this

[Bridge]
Now, left, right, left, right
Take it back, bring it side to side
Like that, like that, ayy
Ooh, now, left, right, left, right
Take it back, bring it side to side
Like

[Chorus]
Nothing feels better than this
Nothing feels better
Nothing feels better than this
Nothing feels better, oh no
We don't gotta hide, this is what you like
I admit
Nothing feels better than this (Better than this)

[Outro]
Nothing feels better than this

[Chorus]
Can we just talk? Can we just talk?
Talk about where we're goin'
Before we get lost, lend me your thoughts
Can't get what we want without knowin'
I've never felt like this before
I apologize if I'm movin' too far
Can we just talk? Can we just talk?
Figure out where we're goin'

[Verse 1]
Yeah, started off right
I can see it in your eyes
I can tell that you're wantin' more
What's been on your mind?
There's no reason we should hide
Tell me somethin' I ain't heard before

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, I've been dreamin' 'bout it
And it's you I'm on
So stop thinkin' 'bout it

[Chorus]
Can we just talk? Can we just talk?
Talk about where we're goin'
Before we get lost, lend me your thoughts (Yeah)
Can't get what we want without knowin' (No)
I've never felt like this before
I apologize if I'm movin' too far
Can we just talk? Can we just talk?
Figure out where we're goin'

[Verse 2]
Oh, nah
Penthouse view, left some flowers in the room
I'll make sure I leave the door unlocked
Now I'm on the way, swear I won't be late
I'll be there by five o'clock

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, you've been dreamin' 'bout it
And I'm what you want
So stop thinkin' 'bout it

[Chorus]
Can we just talk? (Oh) Can we just talk?
Talk about where we're goin'
Before we get lost, lend me your thoughts
Can't get what we want without knowin'
I've never felt like this before
I apologize if I'm movin' too far
Can we just talk? Can we just talk?
Figure out where we're goin'

[Outro]
Figure out where we're goin'

[Intro]
2, 3, 4

[Verse 1]
The hard part always seems to last forever
Sometimes I forget that we aren't together
Deep down in my heart, I hope you're doing alright
But from time to time I often think of why you aren't mine

[Chorus]
But I'll keep your number saved
'Cause I hope one day you'll get the sense to call me
I'm hoping that you'll say
You're missing me the way I'm missing you
So I'll keep your number saved
'Cause I hope one day I'll get the pride to call you
To tell you that no one else
Is gonna hold you down the way that I do

[Verse 2]
Now, I can't say I'll be alright without you
And I can't say that I haven't tried to
But, all your stuff is gone
I erased all the pictures from my phone
Of me and you
Here's what I'll do

[Chorus]
I'll keep your number saved
'Cause I hope one day you'll get the sense to call me
I'm hoping that you'll say
You're missing me the way I'm missing you
So I'll keep your number saved
'Cause I hope one day I'll get the pride to call you
To tell you that no one else
Is gonna hold you down the way that I do

[Bridge]
I hope you think of all the times we shared
I hope you'll finally realize I was the only one who cared
It's crazy how this love thing seems unfair
You won't find a love like mine anywhere

[Chorus]
But I'll keep your number saved
'Cause I hope one day you'll get the sense to call me
I'm hoping that you'll say
You're missing me the way I'm missing you
So I'll keep your number saved
'Cause I hope one day I'll get the pride to call you
To tell you that no one else
Is gonna hold you down the way that I do
But I'll keep your number saved
'Cause I hope one day you'll get the sense to call me
I'm hoping that you'll say
You're missing me the way I'm missing you
So I'll keep your number saved
'Cause I hope one day I'll get the pride to call you
To tell you that I'm finally over you
I'm finally over you

[Verse 1]
As time passes, I feel so low
Searchin' for pieces, covering up the hole
I'll fight for your love, I'll fight for your soul
I'll throw all of my cares away for you
I'll be there to wait for you
Maybe you weren't the one for me
But deep down I wanted you to be
I'll still see you in my dreams
All the things that I did for you, just wasn't it for you

[Chorus]
So I'll be coasting, roller-coasting
Through my emotion
I will be coasting, roller-coasting
I'm hoping that you'll come back to me

[Verse 2]
Moving on seems harder to do
When the one that you love moves faster than you
I gave you my all, I showed the proof of your lies
And you weren't worth it, you don't deserve me
As time passes I'm feeling high
You're not the one I'm thinking of tonight
I may not be over you, but I'll try inside
I'm feeling better now, finally feeling special now, oh

[Chorus]
Coasting, roller-coasting
In my emotions, oh
I'll be coasting, roller-coasting
I noticed you weren't the one for me

[Outro]
You weren't the one for me
You weren't the one for me
You weren't the one for me
You weren't the one for me
Weren't the one for me
You weren't the one
You weren't the one for me
So don't come back to me, no
No, don't come back to me, no
No, don't come back to me
No, don't come back to me, no
No, don't come back to me
You weren't the one for me
You weren't the one for me
You weren't the one for me
You weren't the one for me

[Intro: Khalid]
Na, na, na, na, ooh
Oh, no, oh, ayy

[Chorus: Khalid]

Come outside, looking like a snack, hurry up, get in, hell yeah (yeah)
Come with me on this mission (ooh yeah, ooh yeah)
Riding down the coast (ooh yeah), I want that for sure (ooh yeah)
You say, "Play Khalid" (ooh yeah)

Pull up to the crib, oh, said you've never been before
Put you in Provocateur, girl, I made you mi amor
You said you left your ex, that dude was always gassin'

[Verse 3: 6LACK]
You tryna make a move
Tonight I got the time, tell me what you wanna do
Call the squad if you wanna rendezvous
They gon' push up on they own, I only got room for two
From the 'jects on the set, it's a Porsche, not a 'Vette
I confess, I'ma flex till they show some respect
Get away so we can make sense of your life
You was in park but I just put your shit in drive
Now coast like there's no tomorrow
Moving too fast, I'm open to drive slow (yeah)
I don't want you to wonder where I go
Can learn a lot from this and that's something that I know

[Chorus: Khalid]
Put it in drive, I'll be outside, I'll be on the way
I'll be on the way
You can meet me in five, I'll be all night, I'll be all day
I'll be all day
Put it in drive, I'll be outside, I'll be on the way
I'll be on the way
You can meet me in five, I'll be all night, I'll be all day
I'll be all day

[Intro]
Yeah!
Ha
Yeah!
Ha

[Verse 1]
Woke up a little too late this morning
But I think I'll be okay
I'll be okay
Damn, my car still smells like marijuana
My mom is gonna kill me
Gonna kill me
Traffic's backed up from corner to corner
So I guess I'll hit the highway
The highway
Shake away all the stress off my shoulders
Gonna have a good day
A good day

[Chorus]
Because I'm eighteen
And I still live with my parents
Yeah they're not like yours
Well yours are more understanding
I've never fell in love
I saved those feelings for you
So let's do all the stupid shit that young kids do
It's me and you, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
You, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Just me and you, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Let's do all the stupid shit that young kids do

[Verse 2]
No I've never really been the smartest
Yeah I've made my mistakes
My mistakes
You were there when times were at their darkest
Always showing me the way
Lead the way
Your love seems to cut me deep, the sharpest
You'll always have a part of me
A part of me
Losing you has always been the hardest
I wish it were the old days (oh I wish it were the old days)

[Chorus]
'Cause I was eighteen
And I still lived with my parents
Yeah they're not like yours
Well yours were more understanding
I never fell in love
I saved those feelings for you
When we did all the stupid shit that young kids do
Just me and you, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
You, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Just me and you, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Let's do all the stupid shit that young kids do

[Bridge]
It's me and you
You
You, ooh, ooh, ooh
You
Just me and you
You
You, ooh, ooh, ooh
Hey'hey

[Chorus]
Because I'm eighteen
And I still live with my parents
Yeah they're not like yours
Well yours are more understanding
I've never fell in love
I saved those feelings for you
So let's do all the stupid shit that young kids do
It's me and you, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
It's me and you, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Just me and you, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Let's do all the stupid shit that young kids do

[Outro]
It's me and you, ooh, ooh
Noooo....
Just me and you, ooh, ooh

[Verse 1]
Saturday nights, blueberry cigarillos
Swishers make my throat hurt
Rolling OCB's on the side for me
Light 'em up and let 'em both burn
Family feuds, say your mom's confused
Off of shit she doesn't wanna learn
But daddy's gone, say he's never home
And wishing only makes it worse

[Pre-Chorus]
I guess there's certain dreams that you gotta keep
'Cause they'll only know what you let 'em see

[Chorus]
All the things that I know
That your parents don't
They don't care like I do
Nowhere like I do
And all the things that I know
That your parents don't
They don't care like I do
Nowhere like I do
Nowhere like I do
Nowhere like I do

[Verse 2]
Saturday nights, light gray Silverado
You drive it 'cause you have to
Stay up working late at a job you hate
Fix your makeup in a dirty bathroom
No more love, in and out of clubs
Knowing what you gotta do
You've got plans wrapped in rubber bands
And that's the only thing you'll never lose

[Pre-Chorus]
I guess there's certain dreams that you gotta keep
'Cause they'll only know what you let 'em see

[Chorus]
All the things that I know
That your parents don't
They don't care like I do
Nowhere like I do
And all the things that I know
That your parents don't
They don't care like I do
Nowhere like I do
Nowhere like I do

[Bridge]
'Cause I care, I care about you
There's nowhere I'd rather be
Than right here around you
I care, care about you
There's nowhere I'd rather be

[Chorus]
All the things that I know
That your parents don't
They don't care about you
Nowhere like I do
All the things that I know
That your parents don't
Don't care about you
Nowhere like I
Nowhere like I do (Do, do, do)
Nowhere like I do (Do, do, do)
Nowhere like I do (Do, do, do)
Nowhere like I do (Do, do, do)

[Chorus: Khalid & Empress Of]
Ll'vame a ciudad del sol
Ll'vame, ll'vame
Donde dej' mi coraz'n

[Verse 1: Khalid]
Two days 'til I'm back on the road and I'm wanting you
I hear you calling me, so come onto me tonight
No time to be worried about what we wanna do
Just take care of me, I'll let you take the lead tonight

[Pre-Chorus: Khalid & Empress Of]
Feel it coming over me
S'lo as' junto a ti
Don't let the city break your heart
Conmigo no tienes que llorar

[Chorus: Khalid & Empress Of]
Ll'vame a ciudad del sol
Ll'vame, ll'vame

[Verse 2: Khalid]
No room to be falling for you without honesty
Don't be scared of me
It's where you wanna be, tonight
It's alright, alright for the meantime
If I have to wait, I'll be patient, babe
Tonight

[Pre-Chorus: Khalid & Empress Of]
S'lo as' junto a ti
Don't let the city break your heart (Your heart)
Conmigo no tienes que llorar

[Chorus: Khalid & Empress Of]
Ll'vame a ciudad del sol

[Bridge: Khalid]
Wind it up slow for me, pick it up, pick it up
Wind it up slow for me, pick it up, pick it up
Wind it up slow for me, pick it up, pick it up
Wind it up slow for me, pick it up, pick it up

[Chorus: Khalid & Empress Of]
Ll'vame a ciudad del sol

[Outro]
I-I send you a lot of, a lot of hugs
And, I hope to see you very soon

[Verse 1]
Living the good life full of goodbyes
My eyes are on the grey skies
Saying I don't want to come home tonight
Yeah, and I'm high up, off what?
I don't even remember
But my friend passed out in the Uber ride

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, I'm from the city of the 9-1-5
Where all the girls are pretty
And they're down for the hype
All my boys are with me
Going up for the night
But who cares, who cares
'Cause this is our year

[Chorus]
So wake me up in the spring
While I'm high off my American dream
We don't always say what we mean
That's the lie of an American teen

[Verse 2]
Maybe the end is near
But I've been waiting all year
To get the hell up out of here
And throw away my fears
I'm so faded (I'm so faded)
Off of all the things that I've taken, and
Maybe I'm not really drunk
Maybe I'm really good at faking

[Pre-Chorus]
From the city of the 9-1-5
Where all the girls are pretty
And they're down for the hype
All my boys are with me
Going up for the night
But who cares, who cares
'Cause this is our year

[Chorus]
So wake me up in the spring
While I'm high off my American dream
We don't always say what we mean
That's the lie of an American teen

[Bridge]
My youth is the foundation of me
Living life as an American teen (American teen)
American teen
Mmm, oh yeah
We don't always say what we mean
When we're high off our American teen
My youth is the foundation of me
Oh, I'm proud to be American


[Chorus]
So wake me up in the spring
While I'm high off my American (American dream)
And we don't always say what we mean
It's the lie of an American teen
My youth is the foundation of me
Living life as an American teen
American teen (American teen)

[Outro]
American Teenager
And I'll be living this dream with you

[Chant]
We don't always say what we mean
When we're high off our American teen
My youth is the foundation of me
Oh, I'm proud to be American

[Intro]
Something that you're doing has me falling all the way
I'm tripping off your love and all the other drugs we taking
Over all the others, you're the one all over me
I need your therapy
Need your therapy

[Verse 1]
I don't mean to come off aggressive (no)
I'm just here to pass off the message (yeah)
'Cause you were in my head when
I thought I lost my mind
But we do this every time

[Chorus]
Cause there's something that you're doing has me falling all the way
I'm tripping off your love and all the other drugs we taking
Over all the others, you're the one all over me
I need your therapy, need your therapy

[Verse 2]
I'm not one for relationships
It's over-rated
We could still be lovers
That's all I'm saying, and
Over all the others, you're the one all over me
I need your therapy
Need your therapy

[Bridge]
I'm fiendin' off, fiendin' off you
Lalalalalala
I'm needin', needin' you
Lalalalalala
I'm fiendin' off, fiendin' off you
Lalalalalala
I'm needin', needin' you
Lalalalalala

[Verse 3]
I hope I made the impression
That I was always interested
All the feelings I kept in
What should we do?
Whatever you want to

[Chorus]
'Cause there's something that you're doing has me falling all the way
I'm tripping off your love and all the other drugs we taking
Over all the others, you're the one all over me
I need your therapy, need your therapy

[Verse 4]
I'm not one for relationships
It's over-rated
We could still be lovers
That's all I'm saying, and
Over all the others, you're the one all over me
I need your therapy
Need your therapy

[Bridge]
I'm fiendin' off, fiendin' off you
Lalalalalala
I'm needin', needin' you
Lalalalalala
I'm fiendin' off, fiendin' off you
Lalalalalala
I'm needin', needin' you
Lalalalalala

[Verse 1]
I'm not the best at showing my emotions
You cut me deep and you left me wide open
I fought the demons that lie in between us
They'd think we're perfect if they'd ever seen us, but
I guess this sounds like another sad love song
I can't get over how it all went wrong
But, I let the words come together
Then, maybe I'll feel better

[Chorus]
Bridges they are burning
Lover, I am worried
Tables they are turning
Lover, I am hurting
Burning burning burning, dadadadada
Turning turning turning turning, dadadadada
Burning burning burning, dadadadada
Turning turning turning turning, dadadadada

[Verse 2]
I took the time to think of what you said
You were tap-dancing in my head
I must be honest, I have a lot of pride
But I'm broken inside
I guess this sounds like another sad love song
I can't get over how it all went wrong
But, I let the words come together
Then, maybe I'll feel better

[Chorus]
Bridges they are burning
Lover, I am worried
Tables they are turning
Lover, I am hurting
Bridges they are burning
Lover, I am worried
Tables they are turning
Lover, I am hurting
Burning burning burning, dadadadada
Turning turning turning turning, dadadadada
Burning burning burning, dadadadada
Turning turning turning turning, dadadadada
Burning burning burning, dadadadada
Turning turning turning turning, dadadadada
Burning burning burning, dadadadada
Turning turning turning turning, dadadadada
Bridges they are burning
Lover, I am worried
Tables they are turning
Lover, I am hurting
Bridges they are burning
Lover, I am worried
Tables they are turning
Lover, I am hurting

[Verse 1]
We've been here before, surrounded in the cold
You take me to places I've never known
And you push me to places I'll never go
I would die for you
Tell me the truth
Am I all that you would need?
If we're keeping it a hundred, you're all that I need for me
From the jump until forever from now, I would ride for you

[Chorus]
But you got me shot down by love
You got my heart now
Why won't you stop now?
Oh I've been knocked down by you
You got my heart now
Why won't you stop now?

[Verse 2]
I've been through it whole
I've been through the worst
But I never knew how much our love could hurt
Over my family I put you first
Writing out my feelings is the only thing that work
I don't hear from the friends I thought were mine too
But I hold on to the poems I would write you
Happy seventeen, I saw us two and you saw three
I guess our lines are structured like a haiku

[Chorus 2
You got me shot down by love
And you got my heart now
Why won't you stop now?
Oh I've been knocked down by you
And you got my heart now
Why won't you stop now?

[Bridge]
Knocked down, knocked down
Knocked down, knocked down
Knocked down
Knocked down

[Chorus]
I've been shot down by love
You got my heart now
Why won't you stop now?
I've been knocked down by you
And you got my heart now
Why won't you stop now?

[Verse 1]
I've been seeing angels
In my living room
That have walked the sun
And have slept on the moon
Covered in the fragrance
Of their own perfume
Telling me the stories
Stories coming true
Well you see these angels
These angels see the light
Yeah I had my troubles
Troubles, all right
I've been seeing angels
Oh no

[Verse 2]
They'll hold onto their secrets
And torn up memories
We float above horizons
And sail across the seas
I hope for better days
And lightly times are tough
The angels give me strength
And I'm not giving up
So I wipe away my tears
I unveil my pain
They're brushing off my shoulders
And I hold on to their stain
I've been seeing angels

[Outro]
Angels
Angels
Angels
Angels
Angels
Angels, ayy
Angels

[Verse 1]
Evade my intellect
Feed into my introspect
Wrap your words around my brain
Driving me insane, yeah, ooh
You found the real me
Save my inner being
Switch on me like seasons
Do I need to give you a reason?

[Chorus]
There's millions of reasons to love you (Love you)
There's millions of reasons (Reasons, ooh)
You give me a reason to want you (Want you)
You give me a reason
Give me a reason, give me a reason, give me a reason (Ooh, ooh, ooh)
Give me a reason, give me a reason, give me a reason (Reason)
Yeah (Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)

[Verse 2]
I know you're tired of inconsistency
Are you into me? Are you feeling me?
To be honest
I'm into you, and the way that you talk is so damn cool
With your love I'm on a different high I've never felt before
And if your love is a drug, I'm an addict 'cause, damn, I'm feening for more, yeah
We've been talking for a minute now
Let me know where your heads at, am I in it? Yeah
You put me on your super high
I want to get lost in your paradise

[Chorus]
There's millions of reasons to love you (Love you)
There's millions of reasons (Reasons, ooh, ooh, ooh)
You give me a reason to want you (Want you)
You give me a reason (Yeah, yeah, ooh)
Give me a reason, give me a reason, give me a reason (Ooh, ooh, ooh)
Give me a reason, give me a reason, give me a reason (Ooh, reason, yeah)

[Verse 3]
Lucid dream, in reality
I'm just tryna feel your gravity
Always fallin in love, and I'm tired of the cycle
We don't even need a title
You're always on my mind
It's funny how I'm thinking about you all the damn time
You don't got to be mine, just be mine for the night
I don't know what this is but it feels just right
I wanna make a move
Let me know if that sounds cool, yeah
All the things I'd do
All the things I'd do for you

[Chorus]
There's millions of reasons to love you (Love you)
There's millions of reasons (There's millions of reasons, ooh)
You give me a reason to want you (Want you)
You give me a reason (Reason, ooh, ooh)
Give me a reason, give me a reason, give me a reason (Give me a reason)
Give me a reason, give me a reason, give me a reason (You give me a reason)

[Intro]
Cold blooded, cold blooded

[Verse 1]
The way you've been treating me is getting out of hand
And you walk around like you're so innocent
I gave you my heart and it melted in your arms
This isn't a place that I belong

[Pre-Chorus]
I feel your fear
Surrounded by your skin
You feel my heartbeat vibrate so violent
Inside of your head
I see it in your eyes
You're no good for me
And love is blind

[Chorus]
Ooh, and cold blooded, cold blooded
You want what I'm giving up
But my love is not enough
Cold blooded, cold blooded
And I can't feel my fingertips
But you feel better when we touch

[Verse 2]
I lost my sight and you're leading me on
Is it 'cause you're used to guys always doing you wrong?
Do you really love me?
Or is it just revenge?
Lately you don't seem so genuine

[Pre-Chorus]
And I feel your fear
Surrounded by your skin
You feel my heartbeat vibrate so violent
Inside of your head
I see it in your eyes (see it in your eyes)
That you're no good for me
And love is blind

[Chorus]
Ooh, and cold blooded, cold blooded
You want what I'm giving up
But my love is not enough
Cold blooded, cold blooded
And I can't feel my fingertips
But you feel better when we touch

[Bridge]
Mmmm
Fill me up, keep me hot
Use me up of all I've got

[Pre-Chorus]
I feel your fear
Surrounded by your skin
You feel my heartbeat vibrate so violent
Inside of your head
I see it in your eyes
You're no good for me
And love is blind

[Chorus]
Ooh, and cold blooded, cold blooded
You want what I'm giving up
But my love is not enough
Cold blooded, cold blooded
And I can't feel my fingertips
But you feel better when we touch

[Outro]
Mmmm
Fill me up, keep me hot
Use me up of all I've got
Cold blooded, cold blooded (mmmm)
Cold blooded, cold blooded (mmmm)

[Verse 1]
Can't count up the times you've blown my line
And that's been on my mind a lot lately
I wanna leave the extra all behind, mmm
And I know that you wanna be my baby, mmm yeah

[Chorus]
Said, my bad
Blowin' me up, you've been wildin'
We was cool, yeah, we was vibin'
Gotta put my phone on silent
So my, my, my, my bad
Blowin' me up, you've been wildin'
We were cool, yeah, we was vibin'
Gotta put my phone on silent
So my, my, my bad

[Verse 2]
Oh, we both care about it
But arguing with me just isn't worth it
No, no, no
Don't go reachin' in your bag, your bag, yeah
I didn't text you back 'cause I was workin'
Ah, yeah

[Chorus]
Said, my bad
Blowin' me up, you've been wildin'
We was cool, yeah, we was vibin'
Gotta put my phone on silent
So my, my, my, my bad
Blowin' me up, you've been wildin'
We were cool, yeah, we was vibin'
Gotta put my phone on silent
So my, my, my bad

[Bridge]
Gave you all the signs
Gave you all of my time, my love
You're followin' the signs
But you're followin' the wrong signs, my love
Gave you all the signs
Gave you all of my time, my love
(Gave you all my time and all my love)
You're followin' the signs
But you're followin' the wrong signs, my love

[Chorus]
Said, my bad
Blowin' me up, you've been wildin'
We was cool, yeah, we was vibin' (Vibin')
Gotta put my phone on silent (On silent)
So my, my, my, my bad (My bad)
Blowin' me up, you've been wildin' (Blowin' me up)
We were cool, yeah, we was vibin'
Gotta put my phone on silent
So my, my, my bad

[Outro]
Oh my, my, my
Oh my, my, my
My bad, my bad
Alright

[Verse 1]
I lost my heart in the nighttime
She left me out in the cold
She left me broken and weary
Drunk off the lies she told
I fell in love in the morning
But when the day gets cold
I'm back to life in my lonely
City of El Paso

[Chorus]
But the days get harder in November
Love grows colder in the winter
All the things you say, I'll remember
Promise that you'll keep my love with ya
Promise that you'll keep my love with ya
Promise that you'll keep my love with ya
Love grows colder in the winter
Promise that you'll keep my love with ya

[Verse 2]
I lost my mind when you left me
And I didn't have much of that
But you were so quick to reject me
So I'll take my time being sad
I fell so hard, I'll admit it
The feeling wasn't mutual
So I'm back to live on my lonely
In the city of El Paso

[Chorus]
But the days get harder in November
Love grows colder in the winter
All the things you say, I'll remember
Promise that you'll keep my love with ya
Promise that you'll keep my love with ya
Promise that you'll keep my love with ya
Love grows colder in the winter
Promise that you'll keep my love with ya

[Bridge]
Promise, promise, promise, promise
Promise, promise, promise, promise
Promise, promise that you'll keep my love (keep my love)
Promise, promise, promise, promise
Promise, promise, promise, promise
Promise, promise that you'll keep my love (keep my love)

[Chorus]
But the days get harder in November
Love grows colder in the winter
All the things you say, I'll remember
Promise that you'll keep my love with ya
Promise that you'll keep my love with ya
Promise that you'll keep my love with ya
Love grows colder in the winter
Promise that you'll keep my love with ya

[Verse 1]
Are we better off believing
What the ignorance suggests?
I wish living life was easy (Mhm)
But mine has been a mess
They say it comes with the seasons (Mhm)
But the seasons come and go (They go)
I go blurry when I'm thinking
Is it me or vertigo?

[Pre-Chorus]
Criticized, who am I to give up?
I'm breathing, what's the reason to let up?
Sympathize, who am I to give up?
Putting on my favorite get up

[Chorus]
Are we alive?
Or are we dreaming?
After the ride
Are you leaving?
Are we alive? (Darker days, brighter endings)
Or are we dreaming? (Darker days, brighter endings)
After the ride
Are you leaving? (Darker days, brighter endings)
Yeah

[Verse 2]
I've been better off than broken
I've been battered, I've been beat
I wish I was more outspoken
But the words are out of reach
Hmm, thought I loved you in the moment
I was happy, I was young
I've been learning, I've been growing
But the worst is yet to come

[Pre-Chorus]
Criticized, who am I to give up? (Who am I?)
I'm breathing, what's the reason to let up?
Sympathize, who am I to give up?
Putting on my favorite get up

[Chorus]
Are we alive?
Or are we dreaming?
After the ride
Are you leaving?
Are we alive? (Darker days, brighter endings)
Or are we dreaming? (Darker days, brighter endings)
After the ride
Are you leaving? (Darker days, brighter endings)
Yeah


[Outro]
Eyes closed, eyes closed
I've been falling with my
Eyes low, eyes low
I've been falling with my
Eyes closed, eyes closed
I've been falling with my
Eyes low, eyes low
I've been falling with my
Eyes closed, eyes closed
I've been falling with my
Eyes low, eyes low
I've been falling with my (Vertigo)
Eyes closed, eyes closed (Vertigo)
I've been falling with my (Vertigo)
Eyes low, eyes low
I've been, I've been, I've been
Eyes closed, eyes closed
I've been falling with my
Eyes low, eyes low
I've been falling with my
Eyes closed, eyes closed
I've been falling with my
Eyes low, eyes low
I've been falling with my

[Intro]
Everybody two-step in the motherfucker, what?
Two-step in the motherfucker, yeah
Everybody two-step in the motherfucker, what?
Two-step in the motherfucker, everybody get up, yeah

[Verse 1]
Can you feel this energy?
This is the start of something great
We might... be a little late... hey
Hey, but at least we're on our way
You got too much time to waste
Focusing on what people say
They might not like that we've arrived
But we're here to stay

[Pre-Chorus]
Leave your sorrow on the table
Pick up your worries and throw them out the window
You don't gotta let your friends know
There's so much trouble to get into

[Chorus]
Let's go, let go
Let's go, let go

[Verse 2]
I got a blacked out Chevrolet
You don't have a destination
Traveling where the wind will take us
That might be from place to place
Oh shit, I just graduated
I don't have any obligations
So let's have a little fun
Go 'head and drop all the relations

[Pre-Chorus]
Leave your sorrow on the table
Pick up your worries and throw them out the window
You don't gotta let your friends know
There's so much trouble to get into

[Chorus]
Let go, let go
Let's go, let's go
So let's go, let's go
Let go, let's go

[Verse 1]
Spend my time worrying of broken promises
Focused on the smell of all the burnt out cigarettes
My thoughts play on repeat
Only comfort that I keep
'Cause in a moment I will be
Something you will forget

[Chorus]
Hopeless, hopelessly romantic
You, you got me stranded
Ooh, I'm blue, blue, blue

[Verse 2]
Now tell me was I ever something that you could regret
I know I wasn't the one for you
But at least I tried my best
Surrounded by questions like, "Why'd you two part ways?"
But if my memory's right
You're the one that left

[Chorus]
I'll be hopeless hopelessly romantic
You, you got me stranded
Ooh, I'm blue, blue, blue

[Bridge]
Used to lift me higher
But I guess our time's expired
I'm giving you the match
Set our love on fire

[Chorus]
Hopeless hopelessly romantic
You, you got me stranded
Ooh, I'm blue, blue, blue

[Verse 2 (Reprise)]
Now tell me was I ever something that you could regret
I know I wasn't the one for you
But at least I tried my best
Surrounded by questions like, "Why'd you two part ways?"
But if my memory's right
You're the one that left

[Chorus]
I'll be hopeless hopelessly romantic
You, you got me stranded
Ooh, I'm blue, blue, blue
Ooh yeah, I'm blue, blue, blue, oh
Yeah, I'm blue, blue, blue

[Verse 1: Khalid]
You say I'm trippin'; bullshit
You're the one to make me do shit
You're the one to make me feel it
The feeling of stupid
I was in your corner
When you were putting me through shit
Now you wanna leave
No, you leaving me was foolish

[Pre-Chorus: Khalid]
You left me this scar on my heart
And I left you a brand new car
How nice of you, the price of true love
True love is absolute

[Chorus: Khalid]
So what more can I say?
You make me this way
What more can I say?
You make me this way

[Verse 2: H.E.R.]
Yeah, all of these excuses
Say I'm the one that made you ruthless
Well you're the reason I'm crazy
And with you, I feel useless
I let you have it
You took me for granted
Always wanna play the victim
When they don't know the truth is...

[Pre-Chorus: H.E.R. with Khalid]
You left me this scar on my heart
When I'd never take it that far (oh)
Why would you say that it was true love
If true love is absolute, what more can I say?

[Chorus: Khalid & H.E.R., H.E.R.]
What more can I say?
You make me this way
(You make me this way)
What more can I say?
(What can I say?)
You make me this way

[Bridge: H.E.R.]
I tried to stay the night
You won't let me inside
Oh, you push me away
You'll never change
Just another fight
Between you and your pride
Oh, what more can I say?
What more can I?

[Chorus: Khalid & H.E.R., H.E.R.]
What more can I say? (Say)
You make me this way
You make me this way
What more can I say?
What more?
You make me this way (way)
What, can I?

[Verse 1]
You'd rather speak more than listen
And that's based off our first impression
I'm new to all this affection
But I'm going in the right direction
Floating through different dimensions
But not losing sense of religion
Honey, I forgot to mention
I'm so entranced by you, it hurts

[Chorus]
I'm in love with the moment
See me floatin', see me glowin'
I'm in love with the moment
See me floatin', see me glowin'

[Verse 2]
Can't let me go if I'm fallin'
I've been on the path of importance
Let the love pull you in slowly
The river is running, we're flowing
I'm coming down, you've been rollin'
And we're letting free, now we're open
Pour me a, pour me a potion
I'm rocking, I'm rocking the motion

[Chorus]
I'm in love with the moment
See me floatin', see me glowin'
I'm in love with the moment
See me floatin', see me glowin'

[Outro]
Nothing feels better than this
Now, left, right, left, right
Take it back, bring it side to side
Like that, like that, ayy
Ooh, now, left, right, left, right
Take it back, bring it side to side
Like
Nothing feels better than this
Now, left, right, left, right
Take it back, bring it side to side
Like that, like that, ayy
Ooh, now, left, right, left, right
Take it back, bring it side to side
Like
Nothing feels better than this

That made me feel like I'm just speeding, doing 60 in a 35
We're sitting in a car and just holding hands

[Verse 1]
Roses were your favorite flower
And I couldn't stand the scent
But if it's what it takes to put a smile on your face
I guess I'll deal with it
You hung with the popular kids
And I couldn't stand them
But I sucked it up, because I wanted to be more than friends

[Chorus]
You should walk away with me
In your heart
Keep me in your mind
You don't have to speak
Of our past, just
Keep me in your life
Keep me alive
Keep me alive
Keep me alive
Keep me alive
Keep me alive
Keep me alive
Ohhhhh
Nooooo
Ohhhhh
Nooooo

[Verse 2]
We were ridin' down Dyer with my top down
Singin' our favorite songs
But the funny thing is
Every time we did, you'd always get the words wrong
And I was your biggest fan
You should never forget it
I bet your new man
Doesn't love you like I did
Does he love you like I did?
Does he love you like I did?
Noooo'

[Chorus]
You should walk away with me
In your heart
Keep me in your mind
You don't have to speak
Of our past, just
Keep me in your life
Keep me alive

[Bridge]
Keep me alive
Keep me alive
Keep me alive
Keep me alive
Keep me alive
Keep me alive
Keep me alive
Keep me alive
Ohhhhh
Nooooo
Ohhhhh
Nooooo

[Outro]
You should walk away with me
In your heart
Keep me in your mind
You don't have to speak
Of our past, just
Keep me in your life
Keep me alive
Keep me alive
Keep me alive
Keep me alive
Keep me alive
Keep me alive
Ohhhhh
Nooooo
Ohhhhh
Nooooo

[Intro]
Mmm, mmm
Oh yeah, oh yeah, yeah
Alright

[Verse 1]
Don't save me, I'm in no need of saving (Oh yeah)
And if you stay with me, I know you need patience (Yeah, yeah)
Blood and cologne on the fragrance (Mmm, yeah, yeah)
'Cause if ya deal with me, I know you know what pain is (Oh no)

[Pre-Chorus]
So if you're gonna love me
You gotta love all of me
You gotta love, deeper than that
Now, if you're gonna leave me
You better run far away
I'd hate for you to leave me attached

[Chorus]
'Cause I'm in love with bad luck
I'm in love with bad luck
Move too close, get caught up
Move too close, get caught up
I'm in love with bad luck
I'm in love with bad luck
Move too close, get caught up
Move too close, get caught up
I'm in love with bad luck (Yeah, yeah, yeah)

[Verse 2]
And I don't even like to think about it
On my own, but still so crowded
Walls come down and the guards come up
But there's nowhere to run, I feel surrounded
Hurt feels better when I'm by myself
No one really means it when they're wishing you well
I got no one to call, no one
And people only love you when they're needing your wealth
Damn, laying down, staring at my ceiling fan
Everybody acting like they give a damn
Where is everybody when you need a hand?
I've been burning rubber on the Michelin
Flying in the rain like I'm Superman
I could say I love it, but that just depends

[Chorus]
'Cause I'm in love with bad luck
I'm in love with bad luck
Move too close, get caught up
Move too close, get caught up
I'm in love with bad luck
I'm in love with bad luck
Move too close, get caught up
Move too close, get caught up
I'm in love

[Pre-Chorus]
So if you're gonna love me
You gotta love all of me
You gotta love, deeper than that
Now, if you're gonna leave me
You better run far away
I'd hate for you to leave me attached

[Chorus]
'Cause I'm in love with bad luck
I'm in love with bad luck
Move too close, get caught up
Move too close, get caught up
I'm in love with bad luck
I'm in love with bad luck
Move too close, get caught up
Move too close, get caught up
I'm in love with bad luck

[Outro]
Yeah (I'm in love with bad luck)
Bad, bad luck

[Verse 1]
Power
Got me sittin' by my phone, I've been waiting for hours
On my line, sending mirror pics of you fresh out the shower
So I might as well swing over to your place (Mmm, nah)
It's crowded
In LA, but I'll be there at 8 if the traffic allows it
Say you're down, I could show you around
If you're really about it, yeah
But for you, I got something to prove, what do you say?
What do you say?

[Chorus]
Should we bring it right back?
Honestly, it's better like that
I know we've been falling off track
Bring it right back
I just let the time roll past
We don't gotta take it too fast
Bring it right back
You don't gotta stay the night
I just wanna take the time
I know all the things you like
Maybe if the mood is right
We can bring it right back

[Verse 2]
Saved
Got the weed, we can sit by the beach if we wanna get faded
But if that's not the vibe, yeah, it's cool
We can save it for later, yeah
I just like the way it feels when you're around
When you're around, ah
Now I know we're not dating, nah
Maybe soon by the way things go, we've been talking for ages
Take it step by step, slow it down, we just need to be patient, love
If the love feels good and it's real, it'll all work out
It'll all work out, yeah

[Chorus]
Should we bring it right back?
Honestly, it's better like that
I know we've been falling off track
Bring it right back
I just let the time roll past
We don't gotta take it too fast
Bring it right back
You don't gotta stay the night
I just wanna take the time
I know all the things you like
Maybe if the mood is right
We can bring it right back

[Bridge]
So bring it, so bring it
So bring it, so bring it
So bring it, so bring it (So bring it back)
So bring it, so bring it back (So bring it, yeah)
So bring it, so bring it (Yeah)
So bring it, so bring it (Nah)
So bring it, so bring it (Bring it, bring it)
So bring it, so bring it back
So bring it, so bring it (Yeah)
So bring it, so bring it
So bring it, so bring it
So bring it, so bring it back (No no, no, oh yeah)

[Chorus]
Should we bring it right back?
Honestly, it's better like that
I know we've been falling off track
Bring it right back
I just let the time roll past
We don't gotta take it too fast
Bring it right back
You don't gotta stay the night
I just wanna take the time
I know all the things you like
Maybe if the mood is right
We can bring it right back
Honestly, it's better like that
I know we've been falling off track
Bring it right back
I just let the time roll past
We don't gotta take it too fast
Bring it right back
You don't gotta stay the night
I just wanna take the time
I know all the things you like
Maybe if the mood is right
We can bring it right

[Verse 1]
I've ran away for miles
It's gettin' hard for me to breathe
'Cause the man that I've been runnin' from is inside of me
I tell him keep it quiet
So hardly does he speak
'Cause he wants to keep his distance
But it's hard for him to leave
He knows I hear him cryin'
Cryin' out for help
I don't know how to save him
I can't even save myself
There's many people dyin'
I've always been afraid
Not that I'm scared of livin'
I'm scared of feeling pain

[Chorus]
I don't need another hand, I need a couple suggestions
Always had a little trouble with self-reflections
Now, does my raw emotion make me less of a man? Hmm
Always had a little trouble with self-reflections

[Verse 2]
I've been so used to winnin'
It was hard for me to lose
No, there's nothing wrong with me
There's just something wrong with you
So I've been making changes
Been workin' on my health
No more competition
Can't compete against myself, no, no, no
I'm not doin' this to be loved, no, no
I've been doin' this to be remembered
Let the people hear it if they want to
Help the one's around me get it on, too
If I die tomorrow and I'm gone
Let the blood run high
Let the carpets drown
I'll be forever now

[Chorus]
I don't need another hand, I need a couple suggestions
Always had a little trouble with self-reflections
Now, does my raw emotion make me less of a man? Hmm
Always had a little trouble with self-reflections
I don't need another hand, I need a couple suggestions
Always had a little trouble with self-reflections
Now, does my raw emotion make me less of a man? Hmm
Always had a little trouble with self-reflections

[Outro]
Let this be a promise
That when it's said and done
Be a flower in the garden
Be one with the sun
Be one with the sun
Be one with the sun
Be one with the sun
Be one with the sun

[Verse 1]
We were running onto something
And we didn't say "forever," but it's all we wanted
You were so in love with simple things
And now we're searching for the fire dripped in kerosene
I've been loving more, living less
Off of highs and lows, so obsessed
Couldn't get nothin
But we're never running out

[Chorus]
We'll be free spirits, free spirits
Can you hear me calling?
Oh, it's all or nothing
When you're free spirits, free spirits
Can you hear it calling?
'Cause I don't wanna live and die alone, don't let me go

[Verse 2]
Is this Heaven or Armageddon?
I'll be gettin' high with you to watch the endin'
We were drownin' down our memories
A cemetery full of bottles, man, that liquor bleed
When you're loving more, caring less
It's the highs and lows with no regrets, oh
And we wanted it all then
But we're never running out

[Chorus]
We'll be free spirits, free spirits
Can you hear me calling?
Oh, it's all or nothing
When you're free spirits, free spirits
Can you hear it calling?
'Cause I don't wanna live and die alone, don't let me go

[Bridge]
So tell me when you're falling
No, I can never doubt your love
Can you hear me calling?
Is it everything you're dreaming of?
Leave it all on the night
As long as you're not leaving me behind
On your heart, your heart, ah

[Outro]
Free spirits, free spirit
Free spirits, free spirit

[Verse 1]
Life is never easy when you need it to be
Try to knock me down, but I get back on my feet
Everybody's angry and they're coming for me (Coming for me)
But I can't give them energy that I won't receive (I won't receive)
So I brush 'em off, I got a lot on my sleeve
Like I'm moving backwards, but it's all on repeat
This place is getting crowded, I got no room to breathe
I hope the only thing I'm losing isn't my memory

[Chorus]
'Cause the world keeps spinning, the sun won't shine on my face
I'ma keep it moving, got a hundred things I gotta do today
'Cause the world keeps spinning, the sun won't shine on my face
I'ma keep it moving, got a hundred things I gotta do today

[Verse 2]
Now it's real, take your time, you're almost there
Wherever we're going, gotta be prepared
We'll be fine, are you scared? Are you scared?
People keep on talking 'bout what they wanna be
Walking down the line, but they don't live what they preach (Live what they preach)
Sharing attributes with all our own enemies
You gotta pay to live and even dying ain't free

[Chorus]
'Cause the world keeps spinning, the sun won't shine on my face
(No, I won't give up, no, I won't give up)
I'ma keep it moving, got a hundred things I gotta do today
(Yeah, and I won't be waiting on you)
'Cause the world keeps spinning, the sun won't shine on my face
(No, I won't give up, no, I won't give up, no no)
I'ma keep it moving, got a hundred things I gotta do today, yeah

[Bridge]
You gotta take it slow (Alright)
Dust yourself off, don't you lose control (Yeah, mmm)
Gotta take it slow
Dust yourself off, don't you lose control
(Dust yourself off, don't you lose control)
You gotta take it slow (Oh)
Dust yourself off, don't you lose control
(Dust yourself off, don't you lose control)
Gotta take it slow
Dust yourself off, don't you lose control
(Dust yourself off, don't you lose control)

[Chorus]
'Cause the world keeps spinning, the sun won't shine on my face

[Outro]
Outta sight, outta mind, got no time
So blind, hundred days and I'm still alive, what a life
Outta sight, outta mind, got no time
So blind, hundred days and I'm still alive, what a life
Hundred days and I'm still alive
Hundred days and I'm still alive
Its been a hundred, mmm
Hundred, hundred days and I'm still alive
Had a hundred friends, but I cut em off, I don't need em
Not like any of them gave a fuck if I was breathing
Summer's over so they switching around like the seasons
Gotta keep my guard up, now I'm playing defense
Everybody wants a favor, everybody needs me
But I'm too busy trying to fight away all of my demons
I'm too busy trying to fight away all of my demons
Everybody wants a favor, everybody needs me
Outta sight, outta mind, got no time
So blind, hundred days and I'm still alive, what a life
Outta sight, outta mind, got no time
So blind, hundred days and I'm still alive, what a life
Hundred days and I'm still alive
Hundred days and I'm still alive
Its been a hundred, mmm
Hundred, hundred days and I'm still alive

[Verse 1: Khalid]
I feel like I'm losing you whenever I'm offline
Though I never had you, I used to pretend that you're mine
I feel like there's nothing for me here, but still, I try
I feel like there's nothing for me here, but still, I try
Bruising my finger hitting your line
If I'm holding back, I might just lose my mind (So alone)

[Chorus: Khalid & SAFE]
Keeping my phone alive (Alive)
Hoping that you call this time (Oh, I)
Thought I heard your ringing (You)
You know I hear things sometimes
Call my line, call my line
Come alive, come alive
Show me, don't pretend
Show me, don't pretend
Show me, don't pretend

[Verse 2: Khalid]
Keepin' you on my radar
Lately, you're so damn cold
You used to hold me down
You're far, so it's been a while
I still remember your voice
How you talk so soft in the morning
You're the only one I'm wanting
Love stays still and I'm frozen
But I'm opening thoughts that I keep within
I guess I gotta be a man
I tried as hard as I can

[Chorus: Khalid & SAFE]
Keeping my phone alive (You)
Hoping that you call this time
Thought I heard you ringin'
You know I hear things sometimes
Call my line, call my line
Come alive, come alive
Show me, don't pretend
Show me, don't pretend
Show me, don't pretend
Show me, don't pretend
Show me, don't pretend (Come alive, oh yeah)
Show me, don't pretend (Yeah, yeah)
Show me, don't pretend

[Intro]
Say you can't deal with me no more, just say you don't want me
I never know what you feel no more, just say you don't want me
Say you can't deal with me no more, just say you don't want me
I never know what you feel no more, just say you don't want me

[Verse]
It's been too much, I've been on the side and I'm waiting
Got a little time, maybe all night, if I'm patient
What's on your mind? I can never read you (I can't)
No, I always leave you crying when we fight, but I don't mean to, yeah
No, no, love don't come easy
Especially when you're loving me, yeah
It's never enough for the both of us, so sorry
Couldn't have known it would ever be this hard
Ooh, we had it all, but we lost and that's our fault
I should be here waiting for you to answer my calls, no
But I'm never giving up on word, I've been
I've been focusing on putting me first
Still could never see you with somebody else
I can't even live with being by myself
That's the part of me that really needs your help
Lately, I haven't been doing very well
That's the difference between heaven and hell
I feel heaven when you're here with me
I feel hell every time you leave
But I need to get you off of my back
I gotta get you off of my back
We said we would never take it this far
Here we are, going back and forth
I hoped we would never make it this far
But now, I gotta find my worth

[Outro]
Say you don't love me no more, just say you don't want me
(Say you don't want me, yeah)
We don't gotta be no more if you really don't want to
(We don't gotta be no more)
Say you can't deal with me no more, just say you don't want me
(Just say you don't want me, yeah)
I never know what you feel no more, just say you don't want me
We don't gotta be, we don't gotta be, yeah, no more
We don't gotta be no more, no more, no more, no more, no

[Intro]
Mmm, mmm
Mmm, yeah

[Verse 1]
You go searching for paradise
You sit back and close your eyes
We're burning, yet so alive
And now you've got your hands up
Hoping you catch the high
Feels like the summer time
Chasing the northern lights, oh
Don't like watching your momma cry
You say you'd rather die
She says you're wasting your life

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, life don't stop the more we pray
All your wrongs from yesterday
Smokin' himalayan haze
Won't wash all your sins away

[Chorus]
Hate don't give
Love don't rewind all the good times
All the dollars you'll spend
Give it up for nights like this
Don't give into overthinking
Pour a drink when it ends

[Verse 2]
Do you hear me through your speakers
So much distance, space between us
Say you're dreaming and I've been, too
And no-one knows what you've been through
And I've been thinking a little deeper
Contemplation, getting cleaner
See no leaders, need more teachers
I'm in shambles, I don't sleep much

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, life don't stop the more we pray
All your wrongs from yesterday
Smokin' himalayan haze
Won't wash all your sins away

[Chorus]
Hate don't give
Love don't rewind all the good times
All the dollars you'll spend
Give it up for nights like this
Don't give into overthinking
Pour a drink when it ends (Overthink)

[Outro]
Yeah, yeah

[Verse 1]
Oh, oh, oh, oh
In the back of my mind I know it's hard on us
But to tell you the truth there's no more love, no more love
It's not easy to say, I'm giving up
And I've been losing count

[Pre-Chorus]
When the seconds turn to minutes into hours
You've been working 9 to 5
So it was hard to find the time for me, yeah
Are we gonna be alright
If I come through tonight

[Chorus]
Baby can I stay a while
It's hard to say goodbye when I'm leaving, yeah
Let me inside, dim down the lights
Just know I'm coming home for a reason
Baby can I stay a while
It's hard to say goodbye when I'm leaving, yeah
Let me inside, dim down the lights
Just know I'm coming home for a reason
Baby can I stay a while

[Verse 2]
Nahh, All the shit that you say, do you mean it?
And when you tell me you love me do you believe it?
I can see it in your eyes you've had enough of it
And I've been missing out

[Pre-Chorus]
When the seconds turn to minutes into hours
Working 9 to 5 cause it's hard to find the time for me, yeah
Are we gonna be alright
If I come through tonight, yeah

[Chorus]
Baby can I stay a while
It's hard to say goodbye when I'm leaving, yeah
Let me inside, dim down the lights
Just know I'm coming home for a reason
Baby can I stay a while
It's hard to say goodbye when I'm leaving, yeah
Let me inside, dim down the lights
Just know I'm coming home for a reason

[Chorus]
Baby can I stay a while
It's hard to say goodbye when I'm leaving, yeah
Let me inside, dim down the lights
Just know I'm coming home for a reason
Baby can I stay a while
It's hard to say goodbye when I'm leaving, yeah
Let me inside, dim down the lights
Just know I'm coming home for a reason
Baby can I stay a while

[Verse 1]
My ride or die
Let's burn out tonight
Even if we don't survive
We were right by being wrong
Don't look back to the wreck
Stay with me, turn your head
This is it, all that's left
Just some times that we had, oh

[Chorus]
Heaven, make me an offer
Lord, there's nothing for me left out here
Heaven, if you come over
Oh, I know how to make us disappear

[Post-Chorus]
Ooh, ooh

[Verse 2]
And now the way you say
My name sounds like a song
That you've been singing all along
Don't forget it once I'm gone

[Chorus]
Oh, Heaven (Heaven), make me an offer
Lord, there's nothing for me left out here (Oh)
Heaven, if you come over
Oh, I know how to make us disappear

[Chorus]
Heaven (Hey), make me an offer (Oh)
Lord, there's nothing for me left out here (Yeah)
Heaven, if you come over (Oh-oh-oh-oh, yeah)
Oh, I know how to make us disappear

[Outro]
Heaven, make me an offer
Lord, there's nothing for me left out here

[Verse 1]
You just turned 21, so lately, you've been drinking
Wasted on alcohol you chase to fight the feeling
Thinking 'bout letting go, would that be easy for you then? Yeah
So lay with me, lay with me, we're underneath the bleachers
Stay or leave, stay or leave, I hope you're never leaving
All of these memories crawling underneath your skin, skin (Oh, oh)

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause you're in pain, but who's to blame?
All our lives, it never ends

[Chorus]
Yeah, alright
You gotta hold on tight
Yeah, alright, alright

[Verse 2]
Don't believe everything
The shit you like gives you anxiety, but finally
I see you smiling when you say you need privacy
You're only hiding from yourself, mmm, oh
I say I'm fine, coming home
I see the sun come up and shut the blinds
Episodes, I know I never take my own advice when I'm wrong
But I can't do it by myself, oh

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause you're in pain, but who's to blame?
All our lives, it never ends

[Chorus]
Yeah, alright (Alright)
You gotta hold on tight
Yeah, alright
You gotta hold on tight

[Bridge]
'Cause I'm in pain, but I'm to blame
To end this fight, I have to change

[Chorus]
Yeah, alright
Hold on tight
Yeah, alright
Hold on tight

[Verse 1]
Taking off, turn off the lights
We're so in denial of breaking up, we make it up
Every time I look in your eyes, I'm back in love

[Pre-Chorus]
I've waited all my life, for someone like you
But I'm losing sight of your point of view

[Chorus]
Are we broken? Lost in emotion
Are you all in? Are you bluffing?
Is this the last fight? Lay here one last night
I know we're both tired, that's our excuse
Are you all in? Are you bluffing?

[Verse 2]
It's no one's fault, that's what they say
You want it your way, you know it all
We said its no one's fault, losing our minds
Lie after lie, fake love

[Pre-Chorus]
We had a hell of a ride
Issues aside, both of us

[Chorus]
Are we broken? Lost in emotion (Lost in the moment)
Are you all in? Are you bluffing?
Is this the last fight? Lay here one last night
I know we're both tired, that's our excuse
Are you all in? Are you bluffing?

[Outro]
Are you, mmm, ooh
Are you, oh

[Intro]
So, this is gonna be one take!
One, two, three, four

[Verse 1]
I walk, I walk, I see the light
I push, I fall, and all of my life
I search for my love, I cannot find
A love like yours, as hard as I've tried
Lay by my side just for the night
This isn't love but it feels right
I must admit I cry at nights
I'm stuck on you and I don't know why

[Chorus]
You hit me hard, then you tore my world apart
How do I move on if I don't know where to start?
You've got a hold on me I'll admit that is true
So why do I keep searching when I'm stuck on you?

[Verse 2]
I don't know why I feel like this
At times I don't think I can handle it
I don't know why I feel so low
You were the one who kept me whole
You chew me up then spit me out
You stole the words right out my mouth
You fed me with "I love you"s
I don't know why I'm stuck

[Chorus]
You hit me hard, then you tore my world apart
How do I move on if I don't know where to start?
You've got a hold on me I'll admit that is true
So why do I keep searching when I'm stuck on you?
You hit me hard, then you tore my world apart
How do I move on if I don't know where to start?
You've got a hold on me I'll admit that is true
So why do I keep searching when I'm stuck on you?
You hit me hard, then you tore my world apart
How do I move on if I don't know where to start?
You've got a hold on me I'll admit that is true
So why do I keep searching when I'm stuck on you?

[Intro]
And they wishin' and wishin' and wishin' and wishin'
They wishin' on me, yeah

[Verse 1]
I been movin' calm, don't start no trouble with me
Tryna keep it peaceful is a struggle for me
Don't pull up at 6 AM to cuddle with me
You know how I like it when you lovin' on me
I don't wanna die for them to miss me
Yes, I see the things that they wishin' on me
Hope I got some brothers that outlive me
They gon' tell the story, shit was different with me

[Chorus]
God's plan, God's plan

And when you get to shoppin', you spend it like you earned it
And when you popped off on your ex he deserved it

You used to call me on my
You used to, you used to
Yeah

[Chorus]
You used to call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love
Call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love
And I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing
I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing

[Verse 1]
Ever since I left the city, you
Got a reputation for yourself now
Everybody knows and I feel left out
Girl, you got me down, you got me stressed out
'Cause ever since I left the city, you
Started wearing less and goin' out more
Glasses of champagne out on the dance floor
Hangin' with some girls I've never seen before

[Chorus]
You used to call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love
Call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love
I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing
I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing

[Verse 2]
Ever since I left the city, you, you, you
You and me, we just don't get along
You make me feel like I did you wrong
Going places where you don't belong
Ever since I left the city, you
You got exactly what you asked for
Running out of pages in your passport
Hangin' with some girls I've never seen before

[Chorus]
You used to call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love
Call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love
And I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing
I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing

[Bridge]
These days, all I do is
Wonder if you're bendin' over backwards for someone else
Wonder if you're rolling up a Backwoods for someone else
Doing things I taught you, gettin' nasty for someone else
You don't need no one else
You don't need nobody else, no
Why you never alone?
Why you always touching road?
Used to always stay at home
Be a good girl, you was in the zone
Yeah, you should just be yourself
Right now, you're someone else

[Chorus]
You used to call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love
Call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love
And I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing
I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing

[Outro]
Ever since I left the city'

[Intro: Kyla]
Baby, I like your style

[Verse 1: Drake]
Grips on your waist, front way, back way
You know that I don't play
Streets not safe but I never run away
Even when I'm away
Oti, oti
There's never much love when we go OT
I pray to make it back in one piece
I pray, I pray

[Chorus: Drake]
That's why I need a one dance
Got a Hennessy in my hand
One more time 'fore I go
Higher powers taking a hold on me
I need a one dance
Got a Hennessy in my hand
One more time 'fore I go
Higher powers taking a hold on me

[Refrain: Kyla]
Baby, I like your style

[Verse 2: Drake]
Strength and guidance
All that I'm wishing for my friends
Nobody makes it from my ends
I had to bust up the silence
You know you gotta stick by me
Soon as you see the text, reply me
I don't wanna spend time fighting
We've got no time

[Chorus: Drake]
And that's why I need a one dance
Got a Hennessy in my hand
One more time 'fore I go

Higher powers taking a hold on me

Got a pretty girl and she love me long time
Wine it, wine it, very long time

Cause if you're down, I'll take it slow
Make you lose control
Where, where, where

Oh yeah, very long time
Where, where, where
Back, up, back up and wine it, girl
Where, where, where, where
Cause if you're down
Back up, back up and

You're everything that I see
I want your hot love and emotion endlessly
I can't get over you
You left your mark on me
I want your hot love and emotion endlessly

'Cause you're a good girl and you know it
You act so different around me
'Cause you're a good girl and you know it

Just hold on, we're going home
It's hard to do these things alone
Just hold on, we're going home

[Hook: Drake & Majid Jordan]
Just hold on, we're going home (going home)
Just hold on, we're going home (going home)
It's hard to do these things alone (things alone)
Just hold on, we're going home (going home)

[Bridge: Majid Al Maskati]
You're the girl, you're the one
Gave you everything I loved
I think there's something, baby
I think there's something, baby
You're the girl, you're the one
Gave you everything I loved
I think there's something, baby
I think there's something, baby

[Pre-Hook: Drake & Majid Al Maskati]
'Cause you're a good girl and you know it
You act so different around me
'Cause you're a good girl and you know it
I know exactly who you could be

[Hook: Drake & Majid Jordan]
Just hold on, we're going home (going home)
Just hold on, we're going home (going home)
It's hard to do these things alone (things alone)
Just hold on, we're going home (going home)

[Part 1]

[Intro]
Hol' it yute, hol' it, hol' it, hol' it, hol' it, hol' it
No sleepin' in the streets!
Shaky warrior
Yeah, this that Oliver, 40, Niko shit man
15 Fort York shit, y'know?
Boi-1da, what's poppin'?
Yeah, yeah

[Verse 1]
Runnin' through the 6 with my woes
Countin' money, you know how it goes
Pray the real live forever, man
Pray the fakes get exposed
I want that Ferrari, then I swerve
I want that Bugatti, just to hurt
I ain't rockin' my jewelry, that's on purpose
Niggas want my spot and don't deserve it
I don't like how serious they take themselves
I've always been me, I guess I know myself
Shakiness, man, I don't have no time for that
My city too turned up, I'll take the fine for that
This been where you find me at
That's been where you find me at
I know a nigga named Johnny Bling
He put me on to the finer things
Had a job sellin' Girbaud jeans
I had a yellow TechnoMarine
Then Kanye dropped, it was polos and backpacks
Man, that was when Ethan was pushin' a Subaru hatchback
Man, I'm talkin' way before hashtags
I was runnin' through the 6 with my woes
(Yeah!)

[Part 2]

[Beat Switch]

[Chorus]
I was runnin' through the 6 with my woes
You know how that should go
You know how that should go
You know how that should go
Runnin' through the 6 with my woes
You know how that should go
You know how that should go
You know how that should go
Don't fuck with them niggas, they too irrational, woah

[Verse 2]
This is that nasty flow
Top boy in this shit, I'm so international
Reps up is in here
Got P Reign and Chubby and TJ and Winnie and whoa
Yeah, and you know how that should go
I might declare it a holiday as soon as Baka get back on the road
Yeah, but you know how that should go
They so irrational, they don't wanna patch it up
They wanna mash it up, woah
My nigga Jibba, he whip it, I ride in the passenger
I'm way up, I stay up, I'm two up, I'm three up
I had to get back to you, woah
I'm turnin' into a nigga that thinks about money and women
Like 24/7, that's where my life took me
That's just how shit happened to go
And you know
Runnin' through the 6 with my, with my

[Chorus]
I was running through the 6 with my woes
And you know how that should go
You know how that should go
You know how that should go
Runnin' through the 6 with my woes
You know how that should go
You know how that should go
You know how that should go
Runnin' through the 6 with my woes
You know how that should go

[Outro: Popcaan & Drake]
...Shell out, all if yuh eye nuh big
Always haffi look out, yuh no know if yuh head book out
Dun know, a de Unruly boss, dis man

And if a boy nuh like OVO or Chromatic
Yuh can jus suck yuh mada!!
With no apology, if you nuh like we, we nuh like you neither youth
Your girl a say we cute, if you diss you will get execute
That's the truth, OVO Unruly
(Machine gun shots)
With my woes

[Intro]
Oh man
Oh man, oh man
Not again

[Verse 1]
Yeah, I learned the game from William Wesley, you can never check me
Back to back for the niggas that didn't get the message
Back to back, like I'm on the cover of Lethal Weapon
Back to back, like I'm Jordan '96, '97
Whoa'very important and very pretentious
When I look back, I might be mad that I gave this attention
Yeah, but it's weighin' heavy on my conscience
Yeah, and fuck, you left The Boy no options
I wanna see my niggas go insane
You gon' make me step out of my fuckin' frame
You gon' make me buy bottles for Charlamagne
You gon' make me go out of my fuckin' way
I waited four days, nigga, where y'all at?
I drove here in the Wraith playin' AR-AB
I'm not sure what it was that really made y'all mad
But I guess this is what I gotta do to make y'all rap
I mean whoa, can't fool the city, man, they know what's up
Second floor at Tootsies, gettin' shoulder rubs
This for y'all that think that I don't write enough
They just mad 'cause I got the Midas touch
You love her, then you gotta give the world to her
Is that a world tour or your girl's tour?
I know that you gotta be a thug for her
This ain't what she meant when she told you to open up more
Yeah, trigger fingers turn to Twitter fingers
Yeah, you gettin' bodied by a singin' nigga
I'm not the type of nigga that'll type to niggas
And shout-out to all my boss bitches wifin' niggas
Make sure you hit him with the prenup
Then tell that man to ease up
I did another one, I did another one
You still ain't did shit about the other one

[Chorus]
I got the drink in me going back to back
Yeah, going back to back
I got the drink in me going back to back
Yeah, I'm going back to back

[Verse 2]
I don't wanna hear about this ever again
Not even when she tell him that they better as friends
Not even when you saying, "Drizzy, tell 'em again!"
I been puttin' on a show, it was a sell-out event
Oh, you need better seatin'
I didn't wanna do it, gave me every reason
The point I'm tryin' to make is I don't ever need 'em
Seen what you'd do for fame, what would you do for freedom?
Please, check 'em for a wire or a earpiece
Please, please do not let these niggas near me
Please, think before you come for the great one
Please, who's a real nigga and who ain't one?
Please, somebody stop me
I'm talkin' boasy and gwanin wassy
I got the fest in five days and it's my shit
Soon as a nigga hit the stage, they gon'

[Chorus]
They gon' ask if I can play this shit back to back
Yeah, they want it back to back
They gon' ask if I can play this shit back to back
I took a break from Views, now it's back to that, nigga (Six)

[Produced by Key Wane]

[Intro: Aziz Ansari]
I'm really stepping up my game
These bitches gotta start paying me for this
Can't get no more free, Randy

[Chorus: Drake]
Got everything, I got everything
I cannot complain, I cannot
I don't even know how much I really made, I forgot, it's a lot
Fuck that, never mind what I got
Nigga don't watch that 'cause I'
Came up, that's all me, stay true, that's all me (yeah)
No help, that's all me, all me for real
Came up, that's all me, stay true, that's all me (2 Chainz)
No help, that's all me, all me for real

[Verse 1: 2 Chainz]
Money on my mind, you should think the same
J's on, pinky ring, dogging these hoes, I need quarantine
In the same league, but we don't ball the same
(Ah) She want all the fame, I hear that shit all the time
She said she love me, I said, "Baby girl, fall in line"
Okay, made a million off a dinner fork, watch me switch it up
Walked in, "Ill nigga alert! Ill nigga alert!"
You need that work, I got that work, got bitches in my condo
Just bought a shirt that cost a Mercedes-Benz car note
From the A to Toronto, we let the metal go off
And my dick so hard it make the metal detector go off
This that sauce, this that dressing
Givenchy, nigga, God bless you
If having a bad bitch was a crime, I'd be arrested(Tru)

[Chorus: Drake]
Got everything, I got everything
I cannot complain, I cannot
I don't even know how much I really made, I forgot, it's a lot
Fuck that, never mind what I got
Nigga don't watch that 'cause I'
Came up, that's all me, stay true, that's all me
No help, that's all me, all me for real
Came up, that's all me, stay true, that's all me
No help, that's all me, all me for real

[Verse 2: Drake]
I touched down in '86, knew I was the man by the age of 6
I even fucked the girl that used to babysit
But that was years later on some crazy shit
I heard your new shit, nigga hated it
Damon Wayans, homie don't play that shit
I get paid a lot, you get paid a bit
And my latest shit is like a greatest hits
God damn, ain't no wishing over on this side
Y'all don't fuck with us, then we don't fuck with y'all
It's no different over on this side
God damn, should I listen to everybody or myself?
'Cause myself just told myself:
"You're the motherfucking man, you don't need no help"
Cashing checks and I'm bigging up my chest
Y'all keep talking 'bout who next, but I'm about as big as it gets
I swear y'all just wasting y'all breath
I'm the light skinned Keith Sweat, I'ma make it last forever
It's not your turn 'cause I ain't done yet
Look, just understand that I'm on a roll like Cottonelle
I was made for all of this shit
And I'm on the road box office sales
I'm getting paid for all of this shit
Ask you to please excuse my table manners
I was making room for the table dancers
'Cause if we judging off your advances
Then I just got paid like eight advances, God damn!

[Chorus: Drake]
Got everything, I got everything
I cannot complain, I cannot
I don't even know how much I really made, I forgot, it's a lot
Fuck that, never mind what I got
Nigga don't watch that 'cause I'
Came up, that's all me, stay true, that's all me
No help, that's all me, all me for real
Came up, that's all me, stay true, that's all me'

[Verse 3: Big Sean]
Ho, shut the fuck up!
I got way too much on my mental
I learn from what I've been through
I'm finna do what I didn't do
And still waking up like the rent's due
Not complicated, it's simple
I got sexy ladies, a whole Benz-full
And to them hoes I'm everything'everything but gentle
But I still take my time, man, I guess I'm just old fashioned
Wearing retro shit, that's old fashion
Nigga, see what I'm saying, no closed caption
I paint pics, see the shit, good sex, need to hit
Keep a broad on the floor year 'round like season tickets
I plead the fifth, drink a fifth, load the nine
Leave you split, in the half, smoke a half, need a zip
My new girl is on Glee and shit
Probably making more money than me and shit
I swear to God I got 99 problems but a bitch ain't one
I got 99 problems, getting rich ain't one
Like I got trust issues
I'm sorry for the people I've pushed out
I'm the type to have a bullet-proof condom
And still gotta pull out
But that's just me and I ain't perfect
I ain't a saint but I am worth it
If it's one thing, I am worth it
Niggas still hating but it ain't working
Lil' bitch...

[Verse 4: Drake]
Oh me, oh me, oh my
I think I done fucked too many women from the 305
'Fore the end of this year
I'll do King of Diamonds 3 more times
Smoking on that kush all in our section
Like it's legalized
Girl, you can't always have your way
Sometimes it be like that
They don't really fuck with you like that
They ain't never did me like that
I just took my time, you got the shine
I let you eat like that
I been taught to never loan somebody
What you need right back
And I need that shit right back
(No more free Randy) I'm blessed than a muhfucka
Niggas been stressed than a muhfucka
Niggas getting nervous
Clutching they chests like a muhfucka
Damn that's a motherfucker
Tell the truth, I don't listen to you
'Cause I don't like being lied to
And that ship won't sail
And that wind won't guide you
Daddy was in jail, we was talking through the window
Like a motherfucking drive-thru
That was back then, man
Now my niggas rich enough to do whatever I do

[Chorus]
I've been down so long, it look like up to me
They look up to me
I got fake people showin' fake love to me
Straight up to my face, straight up to my face
I've been down so long, it look like up to me
They look up to me
I got fake people showin' fake love to me
Straight up to my face, straight up to my face

[Verse 1]
Somethin' ain't right when we talkin'
Somethin' ain't right when we talkin'
Look like you hidin' your problems
Really you never was solid
No, you can't "son" me
You won't never get to run me
Just when shit look out of reach
I reach back like one, three
Like one, three, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
That's when they smile in my face
Whole time they wanna take my place
Whole time they wanna take my place
Whole time they wanna take my place
Yeah, I know they wanna take my place
I can tell that love is fake
I don't trust a word you say
How you wanna clique up after your mistakes?
Look you in the face, and it's just not the same

[Chorus]
I've been down so long, it look like up to me
They look up to me
I got fake people showin' fake love to me
Straight up to my face, straight up to my face
I've been down so long, it look like up to me
They look up to me
I got fake people showin' fake love to me
Straight up to my face, straight up to my face

[Verse 2]
Yeah, straight up to my face, tryna play it safe
Vibe switch like night and day
I can see it, like, right away
I came up, you changed up
I caught that whole play
Since, things never been the same

[Pre-Chorus]
That's when they smile in my face
Whole time they wanna take my place
Whole time they wanna take my place
Whole time they wanna take my place
Yeah, I know they wanna take my place
I can tell that love is fake (I can tell that love is fake)
I don't trust a word you say (I don't trust a word)
How you wanna clique up after your mistakes?
(That's just what I heard)
Look you in the face, and it's just not the same

[Chorus]
I've been down so long, it look like up to me
They look up to me
I got fake people showin' fake love to me
Straight up to my face, straight up to my face
I've been down so long, it look like up to me
They look up to me
I got fake people showin' fake love to me
Straight up to my face, straight up to my face

[Outro]
Skrrt
And more chune for your headtop
So watch how you speak on my name, you know?

[Intro: Jhen' Aiko]
What's up?
Been a minute since we kicked it, you've been caught up
With them bitches, I don't get it, you're a star, love
You shouldn't have to deal with that
I'd never make you feel like that, 'cause...

[Chorus: Jhen' Aiko]
I love me
I love me enough for the both of us
That's why you trust me
I know you been through more than most of us
So what are you?
What are you, what are you so afraid of?
Darling, you
You give but you cannot take love

[Verse 1: Drake]
Yeah, I needed to hear that shit, I hate when you're submissive
Passive aggressive when we're texting, I feel the distance
I look around the peers that surround me, these niggas tripping
I like when money makes a difference but don't make you different
Started realizing a couple places I could take it
I want to get back to when I was that kid in the basement
I want to take it deeper than money, pussy, vacation
And influence a generation that's lacking in patience
I've been dealing with my dad, speaking of lack of patience
Just me and my old man getting back to basics
We've been talking 'bout the future and time that we wasted
When he put that bottle down, girl that nigga's amazing
Well, fuck it, we had a couple Coronas
We might have rolled a white paper, just something to hold us
We even talked about you and our couple of moments
He said we should hash it out like a couple of grown ups
You a flower child, beautiful child, I'm in your zone
Looking like you came from the 70's on your own
My mother is 66 and her favorite line to hit me with is
Who the fuck wants to be 70 and alone?
You don't even know what you want from love anymore
I search for something I'm missing and disappear when I'm bored
But girl, what qualities was I looking for before?
Who you settling for? Who better for you than the boy, huh?

[Chorus: Jhen' Aiko]
I love me
I love me enough for the both of us
That's why you trust me
I know you been through more than most of us
So what are you?
What are you, what are you so afraid of?
Darling, you
You give but you cannot take love

[Verse 2: Drake]
Uh, thinking 'bout Texas, back when Porscha used to work at Treasures
Or further back than that, before I had the Houston leverage
When I got Summer a Michael Kors with my momma's debit
A weak attempt at flexing, I'll never forget it
'Cause that night I played her three songs
Then we got to talking 'bout something we disagreed on
Then she start telling me how I'll never be as big as Trey Songz
Boy was she wrong, that was just negative energy for me to feed off
Now it's therapeutic blowing money in the Galleria
Or Beverly Center Macy's where I discovered Bria
Landmarks of the muses that inspired the music
When I could tell it was sincere without tryna prove it
The one that I needed was Courtney from Hooters on Peachtree
I've always been feeling like she was the piece to complete me
Now she engaged to be married, what's the rush on commitment?
Know we were going through some shit, name a couple that isn't
Remember our talk in the parking lot at the Ritz
Girl I felt like we had it all planned out, I guess I fucked up the vision
Learning the true consequences of my selfish decisions
When you find out how I'm living, I just hope I'm forgiven
It seem like you don't want this love anymore
I'm acting out in the open, it's hard for you to ignore
But girl, what qualities was I looking for before?
Who you settling for? Who better for you than the boy, huh?

[Chorus: Jhen' Aiko]
I love me
I love me enough for the both of us
That's why you trust me
I know you been through more than most of us
So what are you?
What are you, what are you so afraid of?
Darling, you
You give but you cannot take love

[Outro: Baka]
Been Baka aka Not Nice from time, G
Been a East Side ting
Scarborough ting from time, G
Been have up di ting dem from time, G
So I don't know what's wrong with these
Little wasteman out here eh?
Y'all need to know yourself

[Produced by Boi-1da, Frank Dukes, Noah "40" Shebib, & Nineteen85]

[Part I: 0 to 100]

[Verse 1]
Fuck bein' on some chill shit
We go 0 to 100, nigga, real quick
They be on that rap-to-pay-the-bills shit
And I don't feel that shit, not even a little bit
Oh, Lord, know yourself, know your worth, nigga
My actions been louder than my words, nigga
How you so high, but still so down to Earth, nigga?
If niggas wanna do it, we can do it on they turf, nigga
Oh, Lord, I'm the rookie and the vet
Shoutout to the bitches out here holdin' down the set
All up in my phone, lookin' at pictures from the other night
She gon' be upset if she keep scrollin' to the left, dawg
She gon' see some shit that she don't wanna see
She ain't ready for it
If I ain't the greatest, then I'm headed for it
That mean I'm way up (Way up)
Yeah, the 6 ain't friendly but that's where I lay up
This shit a mothafuckin' lay-up
I been Steph Curry with the shot
Been cookin' with the sauce, Chef Curry with the pot, boy
360 with the wrist, boy
Ayy, who the fuck them niggas is, boy?
OVO, man, we really with the shits, boy
Yeah, really with the shits
I should prolly sign to Hit-Boy 'cause I got all the hits, boy
Fuck all that "Drake, you gotta chill" shit
I be on my Lil Mouse drill shit
Fuck all that rap-to-pay-your-bills shit
Yeah, I'm on some Raptors-pay-my-bills shit
All up on TV, I thought it'd make me richer
Wasn't payin' me enough, I needed somethin' quicker
So now I'm all in Niko basement puttin' work in on the phones
Either that or drive to Money Mart to make the pickups
Man, it's 2008, I'm tryna paint the picture
Comeback Season in the works and now I'm thinkin' bigger
I got 40 in the studio, every night, late night
Gotta watch that shit, don't want to make him sicker
That's my nigga
Oh, Lord, got a whole lot to show for it
I mean, we can really get it, we can go for it
I'm just here for the bucks and the billis, nigga
Don't make me kill one of the GOATs for it
I run this shit, they like, "Go Forrest
Run Forrest, run Forrest, go Forrest"
Yeah, I mean you already wrote for us
Damn, nigga, what's one more quote for us?
Oh, Lord, who else soundin' like this?
They ain't make me what I am, they just found me like this
I was ready... fuck that, I've been ready
Since my dad used to tell me
He was comin' to the house to get me
He ain't show up
Valuable lesson, man, I had to grow up
That's why I never ask for help
I'll do it for you niggas and do it for myself

[Outro]
I go 0 to 100, nigga, real quick
Real quick, whole squad on that real shit
0 to 100, nigga, real quick
Real quick, real fuckin' quick, nigga
0 to 100, nigga, real quick

Real quick, real fuckin' quick, nigga

[Part II: The Catch Up]

[Bridge]
Whole squad on that real shit
Whole squad on that real shit
Whole squad on that real shit, yeah

[Verse 2]
The other night
Lavish Lee told me that I'm all these people listen to
She said they love me unconditional
Imagine how it feel to watch another nigga at the top
You know that if you wasn't you, you would be dissin' you, dawg
Damn, okay, from that perspective
I see what you're talkin' 'bout, no way to soften that
'Cause me, I was tryna find out where I lost 'em at
But maybe I ain't lose 'em at all
Maybe I keep movin' forward and they're just stagnant
They ain't movin' at all
But when they need a favor, who do they call?
Maybe I'm searchin' for the problems
Askin' what was said and who was involved
Too focused on people's feedback and provin' 'em wrong
They say the shoe can always fit, no matter whose foot it's on
These days feel like I'm squeezin' in 'em
Whoever wore 'em before just wasn't thinkin' big enough
I'm 'bout to leave 'em with 'em
'Cause if I run in the game in these, man, the seams are splittin'
No pun intended but they're smellin' defeat in the air
Headed where nobody took it, who meetin' me there?
They tell him that he's talkin' crazy but he doesn't care
Bein' humble don't work as well as bein' aware
Listen up, boy, you're better off eavesdroppin'
We already got spring 2015 poppin'
PND droppin', Reps-up P droppin'
Majid Jordan droppin', OB droppin', not to mention me droppin'
Feel like we paid the refs off, man, we fixed the game
Me and Noel been at it before Twitter names
Yeah, been on the move like the lease is up
And I can't even name one person that's keepin' up
Damn, fuck how it was in the past tense
Ask yourself, how do we match up now?
'Cause I'm only 27 and I'm only gettin' better
If I haven't passed you yet, watch me catch up now, for real

[Outro: James Blake]
Could it be the way that I'll catch up
Could it be the way that I'll catch up
Could it be the way that I'll catch up
Could it be the way that I'll catch up
Could it be the way that I'll catch up
Could it be the way that I'll catch up
Could it be the way that I'll catch up
Could it be the way that I'll catch up
Could it be the way that I'll catch up

[Verse 1: Drake]
I'm the fuckin' man, y'all don't get it, do ya?
Type of money, everybody acting like they knew ya
Go Uptown, New York City, bitch
Them Spanish girls love me like I'm Aventura
Tell Uncle Luke I'm out in Miami, too
Clubbing hard, fucking women, there ain't much to do
Wrist bling, got a condo up in Biscayne
Still getting brain from a thang, ain't shit changed
How you feel, how you feel, how you feel?
25, sitting on 25 mill', uh
I'm in the building and I'm feeling myself
Rest in peace, Mac Dre, I'ma do it for the Bay
Okay, getting paid, we'll holler whenever that stop
My team good, we don't really need a mascot
Tell Tune, "Light one, pass it like a relay"
YMCMB, you niggas more YMCA
Me, Franny, and Mally Mall at the crib-o
Shout goes out to Niko, J and Chubbs, shouts to Gibbo
We got Santa Margherita by the liter
She know even if I'm fucking with her, I don't really need her
Aww, that's how you feel, man? That's really how you feel?
'Cause the pimpin' ice cold, all these bitches wanna chill
I mean maybe she won't but then again maybe she will
I can almost guarantee she know the deal, real nigga, what's up?

[Chorus: Drake]
Now she want a photo, you already know, though
You only live once: that's the motto, nigga, YOLO
And we bout it every day, every day, every day
Like we sittin on the bench, nigga, we don't really play
Every day, every day, fuck what anybody say
Can't see 'em 'cause the money in the way, real nigga, what's up?

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
One...time? Fuck one time
I'm calling niggas out like the umpire
Seven...grams in the blunt
Almost drowned in her pussy so I swam to her butt
It's Eastside, we in this bitch
Wish a nigga would, like a tree in this bitch
And if a leaf fall put some weed in that bitch
That's my MO, add a B to that shit
I'm fucked up, tore down
I'm twisted: doorknob
Talk stupid? Off with your head!
Nigga, money talks, and Mr. Ed, yeah
I'm so Young Money
Got a drum on the gun, Energizer bunny
Funny how honey ain't sweet like sugar
Ain't shit sweet? Niggas on the street like hookers
I tongue kiss her other tongue
Skeet skeet skeet: water gun
Oh my God, Becky, look at her butt! Tunechi

[Chorus: Drake]
Now she want a photo, you already know, though
You only live once: that's the motto, nigga, YOLO
And we bout it every day, every day, every day
Like we sittin on the bench, nigga, we don't really play
Every day, every day, fuck what anybody say
Can't see 'em 'cause the money in the way, real nigga, what's up?
Now she want a photo, you already know, though
You only live once: that's the motto, nigga, YOLO

[Verse 1]
I done kept it real from the jump
Livin' at my momma's house, we'd argue every month
Nigga, I was tryna get it on my own
Workin' all night, traffic on the way home
And my uncle callin' me, like, "Where you at?
I gave you the keys, told you bring it right back'
Nigga, I just think it's funny how it goes
Now I'm on the road, half a million for a show, and we'

Boys tell stories 'bout the man
Say I never struggled, wasn't hungry, yeah, I doubt it
Nigga, I could turn your boy into the man
There ain't really much out here that's poppin' off without us
Nigga, we just want the credit where it's due

[Intro: Jimmy Smith]
Good God Almighty'like back in the old days...
You know, years ago they had the A&R men to tell you what to play, how to play it and you know whether it's disco and rock but we just went in the studio and we did it. We had the champagne in the studio, of course'compliments of the company'and we just laid back and did it. So we hope you enjoy listening to this album half as much as we enjoyed playing it for you. Because we had a ball. Only real music is gonna last'all the other bullshit is here today and gone tomorrow...

[Chorus: Timbaland]
Cash rules everything around me, frikki-frikki-frik
C.R.E.A.M.; get the-get the-get the-get the
Get the-get the-get the-get the money, dollar-dollar
D-d-d-d-dollar-dollar, dollar-dollar bill y'all (y'all, y'all)
Cash rules everything around me, frikki-frikki-frik
C.R.E.A.M.; get the-get the-get the-get the
Get the-get the-get the-get the money, dollar-dollar
D-d-d-d-dollar-dollar, dollar-dollar bill y'all (y'all, y'all)

[Verse 1: Drake]
Yeah
Uh, after hours at Il Mulino
Or Sotto Sotto, just talkin' women and vino
The contract like '91 Dan Marino
I swear this guy Michael Rapino's boosting my ego
Overly focused, it's far from the time to rest now
Debates growin' 'bout who they think is the best now
Took a while, got the jokers out of the deck now
I'm holdin' all the cards and niggas wanna play chess now
I hear you talking, say it twice so I know you meant it
Fuck it, I don't even tint it, they should know who's in it
I'm authentic, real name, no gimmicks
No game, no scrimmage, I ain't playin' with you niggas at all
My classmates, they went on to be chartered accountants
Or work with their parents
But thinkin' back on how they treated me
My high school reunion might be worth an appearance
Make everybody have to go through security clearance
Tables turn, bridges burn, you live and learn
With the ink I could murder, word to my nigga Irv
Yeah, I swear shit just started clickin' dog
You know it's real when you are who you think you are

[Chorus: Timbaland]
Cash rules everything around me, frikki-frikki-frik
C.R.E.A.M.; get the-get the-get the-get the
Get the-get the-get the-get the money, dollar-dollar
D-d-d-d-dollar-dollar, dollar-dollar bill y'all (y'all, y'all)
Cash rules everything around me, frikki-frikki-frik
C.R.E.A.M.; get the-get the-get the-get the
Get the-get the-get the-get the money, dollar-dollar
D-d-d-d-dollar-dollar, dollar-dollar bill y'all (y'all, y'all)

[Verse 2: JAY-Z]
Uh, I had Benzes 'fore you had braces
The all-black Maybach but I'm not a racist
Inside's whiter than Katy Perry's face is
Yellow diamonds in my Jes's
I just might learn to speak Mandarin
Japanese for the yen that I'm handlin'
International Hov, that's my handle
My saint's Chang', light a candle
El Gran Santo on the mantle
Case y'all didn't know, I speak Spanish too, uh
Shout out to World Wide Wes
Everywhere we go, we leave a worldwide mess
Yes, still Roc La Familia
Says a lot about you if you not feeling us
The homie said "Hov, it ain't many of us"
I told 'em "Less is more, nigga, is plenty of us"

[Chorus: Timbaland]
Cash rules everything around me, frikki-frikki-frik
C.R.E.A.M.; get the-get the-get the-get the
Get the-get the-get the-get the money, dollar-dollar
D-d-d-d-dollar-dollar, dollar-dollar bill y'all (y'all, y'all)

[Verse 3: JAY-Z]
Cake, cake-cake, cake-cake, cake
500 million, I got a pound cake
Niggas is frontin', that's upside-down cake
Get 'em a red nose, they clown cakes
They shoulda never let you 'round cake
Look at my neck, I got a karat cake, uh
Now here's the icin' on the cake
Cake, cake-cake, cake-cake, uhh
I'm just gettin' started, oh, yeah, we got it bitch
I've done made more millionaires than the lotto did
Dame made millions, Biggs made millions
Ye made millions, Just made millions
Lyor made millions, Cam made millions
Beans'a tell you if he wasn't in his feelings
Uh, I'm back in my bag
My eyes bloodshot but my jet don't lag
A pair of Jordan 3's tryna chase this cash
Gucci airbag just in case we crash
Uh, last night was mad trill
I'm fresh out of Advil, Jesus grab the wheel

[Part 2: Paris Morton Music 2, Produced by Detail]

[Verse 4: Drake]
Yeah, uh
Look, fuck all that "Happy to be here" shit that y'all want me on
I'm the big homie, they still be tryna lil bro me, dog
Like I should fall in line, like I should alert niggas
When I'm 'bout to drop somethin' crazy
And not say I'm the greatest of my generation
Like I should be dressing different
Like I should be less aggressive and pessimistic
Like I should be way more nervous and less dismissive
Like I should be on my best behavior and not talk my shit
And do it major like the niggas who paved the way for us
Like I didn't study the game to the letter
And understand that I'm not doin' it the same
Man, I'm doing it better
Like I didn't make that clearer this year
Like I should feel, I don't know, guilty for saying that
They should put a couple more mirrors in here
So I can stare at myself
These are usually just some thoughts
That I would share with myself
But I thought "Fuck it", it's worth it to share 'em
With someone else other than Paris for once
I text her from time to time, she a mom now
I guess sometimes life forces us to calm down
I told her she could live with me if she need to
I got a compound but I think she's straight
'Cause she supported since Hot Beats
Right before Wayne came and got me
Out of the back room where I was rapping with Jas
Over beats that I shouldn't have in the hopes for the glory
He walked right past in the hallway
Three months later, I'm his artist
He probably wouldn't remember that story
But that shit stick with me always
Couldn't believe when he called me
You never know what could happen to you
And I just spent four Ferraris all on a brand new Bugatti
And did that shit 'cause it's somethin' to do
Yeah, I guess that's just who I became, dawg
Nothing was the same, dawg

[Intro: Drake]
Gotta do what I gotta do, yeah

[Verse 1: Drake]
All my exes live in Texas like I'm George Strait
Or they go to Georgia State where, tuition is handled
By some random nigga that live in Atlanta
That she only see when she feels obligated
Admitted it to me the first time we dated
But she was no angel, and we never waited
I took her for sushi, she wanted to fuck
So we took it to go, told 'em don't even plate it
And we never talk too much after I blew up
Just only "hello" or a "happy belated"
And I think I text her and told her I made it
And that's when she text me and told me she prayed it
And that's when I text her and told her I love her
Then right after texted and told her I'm faded
She asked what have I learned since getting richer
I learned workin' with the negatives could make for better pictures
I learned Hennessy and enemies is one hell of a mixture
Even though it's fucked up, girl I'm still fucking with ya
Damn, is it the fall, time for me to revisit the past
There's women to call, there's albums to drop, there's liquor involved
There's stories to tell, we been through it all (Damn)
Interviews are like confessions
Get the fuck up out my dressing room, confusing me with questions like

[Pre-Chorus: Lil Wayne]
Do you love this shit? Are you high right now?
Do you ever get nervous?
Are you single? I heard you fucked your girl, is it true?
You getting money?
You think them niggas you with is with you?

[Chorus: Lil Wayne]
And I say hell yeah, hell yeah, hell yeah
Fuckin' right, fuckin' right, alright
And we say hell yeah, hell yeah, hell yeah
Fuckin' right, fuckin' right, alright

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
Uhh, so much for being optimistic
They say love is in the air, so I
Hold my breath until my face turn purple
Keep a few bad bitches in my circle
My nuts hang like ain't no curfew
Bitch, if you wave, then I will surf you
I flew jet, she flew commercial
But we still met later that night
After my session, she came over
I was aggressive and she was sober
I gave her a pill, she started confessing
And started undressing and ask me to hold her
And so I did, but that was last month
And now she's texting me asking for closure
Damn, she say this shit gon' catch up to me, I keep tissue paper
We eat each other whenever we at the dinner table
She say she hate that she love me and she wish I was average
Shit, sometimes I wish the same and I wish she wasn't married
Promises, I hope I never break 'em
Met a female dragon, had a fire conversation
But, interviews are like confessions
Get the fuck up out my bedroom, confusing me with questions like

[Pre-Chorus: Lil Wayne]
Do you love this shit? Are you high right now?
Do you ever get nervous?
Are you single? I heard you fucked your girl, is it true?
You getting money?
You think them niggas you with is with you?

[Chorus: Lil Wayne & Drake]
And I say hell yeah, hell yeah, hell yeah
Fuckin' right, fuckin' right, alright
And we say hell yeah, hell yeah, hell yeah
Fuckin' right, damn right, alright
And we say hell yeah, hell yeah, hell yeah
Fuckin' right, fuckin' right, alright
And we say hell yeah, hell yeah, hell yeah
Fuckin' right, damn right, alright, yeah

[Outro: Drake]
Yeah, yeah, oh-yeah, oh-yeah

You said something about a cold drink?
I don't know, I'm delirious...

[Verse 1: Drake]
Cups of the ros'
Bitches in my old phone

I've been in this club too long
The woman that I would try
Is happy with a good guy
But I've been drinkin' so much
That I'ma call her anyway, and say'

[Chorus: Drake]
Fuck that nigga that you love so bad
I know you still think about the times we had
I say fuck that nigga that you think you found
And since you picked up, I know he's not around

[Bridge: Drake & (Ericka Lee)]

Tell me, have you heard that lately?
I'm just sayin' you could do better
And I'll start hatin' only if you make me

[Verse 2: Drake]
Uh, cups of the XO

[Verse 3: Drake]
I think I'm addicted to naked pictures
And sitting talking 'bout bitches that we almost had
I don't think I'm conscious of makin' monsters
Outta the women I sponsor 'til it all goes bad
But, shit, it's all good
We threw a party, yeah, we threw a party
Bitches came over, yeah, we threw a party
I was just calling, 'cause they were just leavin'
Talk to me, please, don't have much to believe in
I need you right now, are you down to listen to me?
Too many drinks have been given to me
I got some women that's livin' off me
Paid for their flights and hotels, I'm ashamed
Bet that you know them, I won't say no names
After a while, girl, they all seem the same
I've had sex four times this week; I'll explain
Havin' a hard time adjustin' to fame
Sprite in that mixture
I've been talkin' crazy, girl, I'm lucky that you picked up
Lucky that you stayed on
I need someone to put this weight on
"Well, I'm sorry."

[Bridge: Drake & (Ericka Lee)]
(Are you drunk right now?)
I'm just sayin' you could do better
Tell me, have you heard that lately?
I'm just sayin' you could do better
And I'll start hatin' only if you make me

[Interlude: Drake]
You're not gonna come?
Guess I'm 'bout to just kick it here then

[Outro: Drake]
Just throw up while I hold your hair back
Her white friend said, "You niggas crazy"
I hope no one heard that
I hope no one heard that
'Cause if they did, we gonna be in some trouble
We really gonna be in some trouble, trouble

Gotta hit the club, gotta make that ass jump
Gotta hit the club like you hit them mothafuckin' angles
With your phone out, snappin' like you Fabo

[Chorus]
Passionate from miles away
Passive with the things you say
Passin' up on my old ways

Passionate from miles away
Passive with the things you say
Passin' up on my old ways
I can't blame you, no, no

[Verse 2]
Listen
Harder buildin' trust from a distance
I think we should rule out commitment for now
'Cause we're fallin' apart
Leavin'
You're just doing that to get even
Don't pick up the pieces, just leave it for now
They keep fallin' apart

[Chorus]
Passionate from miles away
Passive with the things you say
Passin' up on my old ways
I can't blame you, no, no
Passionate from miles away
Passive with the things you say
Passin' up on my old ways
I can't blame you, no, no

[Outro: Zo' Kravitz]
Um, trying to think of the right thing to say

[Intro]
Breaking news, my niggas
If your girlfriend has went to any
Season opener basketball game
Best believe, she's fucking some niggas on that team
She's fucking somebody on the basketball team
If she's at the game
Right, right, yeah

[Chorus: Drake]
I say bounce that shit like woah
Yeah, bounce that shit like woah
This is not a fairytale, I already know how you like it
Take you to the mall and get you a new outfit
Girl, that's just some child's play
Bounce that shit like woah, woah, woah
Woah, woah, heard all of the stories about you
I already know and I like it
Take you to the mall and get you a new outfit
Girl, that's just some child's play
Bounce that shit like woah, yeah
Bounce that shit like woah

[Verse 1: Drake]
Why you gotta fight with me at Cheesecake?
You know I love to go there
Say I'm actin' lightskin, I can't take you nowhere
This a place for families that drive Camrys and go to Disney
They don't need to know all of our business
You wildin', you super childish, you go to CVS for Kotex
In my Bugatti, I took the key and tried to hide it
So you can't drive it, and put on mileage
Then you find it, awkward silence
Momma is a saint, yes, she raised me real good
All because of her I don't do you like I should
Don't make me give you back to the hood
Don't make me give you back

[Chorus: Drake]
I say bounce that shit like woah
Yeah, bounce that shit like woah
This is not a fairytale, I already know how you like it
Take you to the mall and get you a new outfit
Girl that's just some child's play
Bounce that shit like woah, woah, woah
Woah, woah, heard all of the stories about you
I already know and I like it
Take you to the mall and get you a new outfit
Girl, that's just some child's play
Bounce that shit like woah, yeah
Bounce that shit like woah

[Verse 2: Drake]
You don't wanna fall in love, I know
I'm not someone you should trust, I know
I give Chanel out like a hug, I know
I knew a couple of your friends way before
How many girls have slept in this bed?
Say a different number than the one that's in my head
Lying to protect you, I be doing that a lot
My past checkered like the Louis you just got
Married in our twenties, now, where the fun in that?
My city love me like a college running back
Pack a bag, you gon' end up staying where I'm at
Took you from the hood and I could never give you back
I just wanna let you know that someone love you back
All the Cadillac like I'm Teddy Pendergrass
Whippin' on this shit, I'm getting ready, where you at?
Riding...

[Refrain 2: Ha-Sizzle]
She rode that dick like a soldier
She rode it like a soldier

I'm tryna tell ya I got enemies, got a lot of enemies
Every time I see 'em, somethin' wrong with their memory
Tryna take the wave from a nigga
So tired of savin' all these niggas, mayne
Yeah, run 'em

[Chorus]
I got enemies, got a lot of enemies
Got a lot of people tryna drain me of this energy
They tryna take the wave from a nigga
Fuckin' with the kid and pray for your nigga
(I'm off this)

[Intro: Drake]
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah

[Verse 1: Drake]
Look...I don't know how to talk to you
I don't know how to ask you if you're okay
My friends always feel the need to tell me things
Seems like they're just happier than us these days
Yeah
These days I don't know how to talk to you
I don't know how to be there when you need me
It feels like the only time you see me
Is when you turn your head to the side and look at me differently
Yeah

[Pre-Chorus: Drake]
And last night I think I lost my patience
Last night, I got high as your expectations
Last night, I came to a realization
And I hope you can take it
I hope you can take it, oh

[Chorus: Drake]
I'm too good to you
I'm way too good to you
You take my love for granted
I just don't understand it
No, I'm too good to you
I'm way too good to you
You take my love for granted
I just don't understand it

[Verse 2: Rihanna]
I don't know how to talk to you
I just know I found myself getting lost with you
Lately you just make me work too hard for you
Got me on flights overseas, and I still can't get across to you

[Pre-Chorus: Rihanna]
And last night I think I lost my patience
Last night, I got high as your expectations
Last night, I came to a realization
And I hope you can take it
I hope you can take it, oh

[Chorus: Drake & Rihanna]
I'm too good to you
I'm way too good to you
You take my love for granted
I just don't understand it
No, I'm too good to you
I'm way too good to you
You take my love for granted
I just don't understand it

[Verse 3: Drake]
Years go by too fast
I can't keep track
How long did we last?
I feel bad for asking
It can't end like this
We gotta take time with this
Cock up yuh bumper, sit down pon it
Let me see if this is something I can fix (Six)
You got somebody other than me
Don't play the victim when you're with me
Free time is costing me more than it seems
Sacrificing things
And I wanna tell you my intentions
I wanna do the things that I mention
I wanna benefit from the friendship
I wanna get the late night message from you, from you
I put my hands around you
Gotta get a handle on you
Gotta get a handle on the fact that...

[Chorus: Drake & Rihanna]
I'm too good to you
I'm way too good to you
You take my love for granted
I just don't understand it
No, I'm too good to you
I'm way too good to you
You take my love for granted
I just don't understand it

[Outro: Popcaan]
Gyal a you mi waan
Pay fi yuh visa meck yo fly out regular
Baby, cock up yuh bumper, sit down pon it
Gyal yo pum pum good and yuh fit
Mi wi give you everything weh deh in my wallet
And in my pocket
Cock up yuh bumper, sit down pon it
Gyal yo pum pum good and yuh fit
Mi wi give you everything weh deh in my wallet
And in my pocket

[Verse 1]
Somewhere between psychotic and iconic
Somewhere between I want it and I got it
Somewhere between I'm sober and I'm lifted
Somewhere between a mistress and commitment
But I stay down, girl I always stay down, get down, never lay down
Promise to break everybody off before I break down
Everyone just wait now, so much on my plate now
People I believed in they don't even show they face now
What they got to say now? Nothin' they can say now
Nothin' really changed but still they look at me a way now
What more can I say now? What more can I say now?
You might feel like nothin' was the same

[Chorus]
I still been drinkin' on the low, mobbin' on the low
Fuckin' on the low, smokin' on the low
I still been plottin' on the low, schemin' on the low
The furthest thing from perfect like everyone I know
I just been drinkin' on the low, mobbin' on the low
Fuckin' on the low, smokin' on the low
I just been plottin' on the low, schemin' on the low
The furthest thing from perfect like everyone I know

[Verse 2]
And I hate that you don't think I belong to ya
Just too busy runnin' shit to run home to ya
You know that paper my passion
Bittersweet celebrations, I know I can't change what happened
I can't help it, I can't help it, I was young and I was selfish
I made every woman feel like she was mine and no one else's
And now you hate me, stop pretendin', stop that frontin', I can't take it
Girl don't treat me like a stranger, girl you know I seen you naked
Girl you know that I remember, don't be a pretender
Gettin' high at the condo, that's when it all comes together
You know I stay reminiscing and make-up sex is tradition
But you been missin' girl and you might feel like nothin' was the same

[Chorus]
I still been drinkin' on the low, mobbin' on the low
Fuckin' on the low, smokin' on the low
I still been plottin' on the low, schemin' on the low
The furthest thing from perfect like everyone I know
I just been drinkin' on the low, mobbin' on the low
Fuckin' on the low, smokin' on the low
I just been plottin' on the low, schemin' on the low
The furthest thing from perfect like everyone I know

[Beat Switch]

[Bridge]
Drinkin', smokin', fuckin', plottin'
Schemin', plottin', schemin', gettin' money
Drinkin', fuckin', smokin', plottin'
Schemin', plottin', schemin', gettin' money

[Verse 3]
Uh, this the life for me
My momma told me this was right for me
I got 'em worried, like make sure you save a slice for me
I should have Spoons serve you up with a fork and knife for me
Your actions make us doubt you
Your lack of effort got me rappin' different
This the shit I wanna go out to
Play this shit at my funeral if they catch me slippin'
Naked women swimmin', that's just how I'm livin'
Donate a million to some children, that's just how I'm feelin'
A nigga fillin' up arenas, who the fuck could see us?
I had to Derrick Rose the knee up before I got the re-up
Yours truly, the boy
I just build and build more, y'all niggas build to destroy
Y'all niggas party too much, man, I just chill and record
No filler, you feel it now if you ain't feel it before

[Outro]
Yes, Lord, this the shit I wanna go out to
Yeah yeah, this the shit I wanna go out to

[Chorus: Gabriel Garz'n Montano]
Rock me real slowly
Put a bib on me
I'm just like a baby, droolin' over you
The things you do

[Verse 1: Drake]
These days, I'm lettin' God handle all things above me
The things I can't change are the reason you love me
Listen, you can hear them callin' my name
I'm all over the place, I can't sit in one place
I'm not ashamed at all
Still findin' myself, let alone a soulmate, I'm just sayin'
Feel like we one and the same, our relationship changed
That or it never existed
Whenever they say somethin' 'bout us you listen
But fuck what they talkin' about on your timeline
That's cuttin' all into my time with you
Fuck what they talkin' about on your timeline
That's cuttin' all into my time with you
My time with you, my

[Chorus: Gabriel Garz'n Montano]
Rock me real slowly
Put a bib on me
I'm just like a baby, droolin' over you
The things you do

[Verse 2: Drake]
She said you're my everything
I love you through everything, I done did everything to her
She forgave me for everything, this a forever thing
Hate that I treat it like it's a whatever thing
Trust me, girl, this shit is everything to me
She from the jungle, she from the jungle
I take somebody else's car, drive there undercover
This shit is everything to me, this shit is everything
Don't know where we stand, I used to hit you 'bout everything

[Bridge: Drake]
Are we still good? Are we still good?
Are we still good? Are we still good?
If I need to talk, are you around?
Are you down for the cause?
Are you down? Are you down? Are you down?
Are you down for the cause?

[Pre-Chorus: Drake]
Are you down? Are you down? Are you down?
Are you down for the cause?
You still down? You still down? You still down?

[Chorus: Gabriel Garz'n Montano]
Rock me real slowly
Put a bib on me
I'm just like a baby, droolin' over you
The things you do

[Verse 3: Drake]
Yeah, these days these new girls, they got me nervous
They go to school and do bottle service
They can't decide, they keep switchin' majors
Being indecisive makes me anxious
Call your number and it's out of service

[Pre-Chorus: Drake]
Who can I call for your information?
What am I supposed to do
After we done everything that we've done?
Who is your replacement?
Are we still good? Are we still good?
Are we still good? Are we still good?

[Chorus: Gabriel Garz'n Montano]
Rock me real slowly
Put a bib on me
I'm just like a baby, droolin' over you
The things you do

[Chorus 1: Chantal Kreviazuk]
How I'm feeling, it doesn't matter
'Cause you know I'm okay
Instead, I ask myself, "Why do you worry?"
When you know, you know I'm the same
I know, I know you don't love me, baby
They're trying to take you away from me
Only over my dead body

[Verse 1: Drake]
I think I killed e'rybody
In the game last year, man, fuck it, I was on though
And I thought I found the girl of my dreams
At the strip club, mmm-mmm, fuck it, I was wrong though
Shout out to all my niggas living tax free
Nowadays it's six figures when they tax me
Oh well, I guess you lose some and win some
Long as the outcome is income
You know I want it all and then some
Shout out to Asian girls, let the lights dim some
Shots came, I don't know where they was sent from
Probably some bad hoes I'm 'bout to take the hint from
Yeah, you know me well, nigga
I mean you ain't the only real nigga
They got me on these white women like Seal, nigga
Slave to the pussy but I'm just playing the field, nigga
Are these people really discussing my career again?
Asking if I'll be going platinum in a year again?
Don't I got the shit the world wanna hear again?
Don't Michael Jordan still got his hoop earring in?
Man all of your flows bore me: paint drying
And I don't ever be trippin off of what ain't mine
And I be hearing the shit you say through the grapevine
But jealousy is just love and hate at the same time
Yeah, it's been that way from the beginning
I just been playing, I ain't even notice I was winning

[Refrain: Drake]
And this is the only sound you should fear
Man, these kids wear crowns over here and everything is all right

[Chorus 2: Chantal Kreviazuk]
Oh, I know, I know you don't love me, baby
They're trying to take you away from me
Only over my dead body

[Verse 2: Drake]
You say I'm old news, well who the new star?
Cause if I'm going anywhere, it's probably too far
Just performed at a Bar Mitzvah over in the States
Used half of the money to beat my brother's case
Red wine over Fed time
And shout out to the niggas that's doing dead time
Shout out to the bitches there when it's bedtime
And fuck you to the niggas that think it's their time
Yeah, don't make me take your life apart, boy
You and whoever the fuck gave you your start boy
Oh, you wanna be a motherfucking funny guy?
Don't make me break your Kevin Hart, boy
Yeah, it's whatever
You know, feeling good, living better
I think maybe I was numb to it last year
But you know I feel it now more than ever
My city love me like Mac Dre in the Bay
Second album, I'm back paving the way
The backpackers are back on the bandwagon
Like this was my comeback season back, back in the day
And I met your baby moms last night
We took a picture together, I hope she frames it!
And I was drinking at the Palms last night
And ended up losing everything that I came with
Feel like I've been here before, huh?
I still got ten years to go, huh?

[Refrain: Drake]
And this is the only sound you should fear
Man, these kids wear crowns over here and everything is all right

[Chorus 2: Chantal Kreviazuk]
Oh, I know, I know you don't love me, baby
They're trying to take you away from me
Only over my dead body

[Outro]
Three in the morning, still going down

[Verse 1]
Worst...
Mothafucka never loved us
Fucka never loved us
You ain't know, now you know now
Still at it, scrub J's with a toothbrush
Shit...
Niggas still playing my old shit
But your shit is like the police askin' us questions
Nigga, we don't know shit
Flexin'...
Nigga, I'm just flexin'
Nigga never loved us
Do it look like we stressin'?
Look at you, look at you and look at you
Aww, I'm glad that they chose us
'Cause man it's a mission, tryna fight to the finish
Just to see am I finished

[Chorus]
On my worst behavior, no? They used to never want to hear us
Remember? Mothafucka never loved us
Remember? Mothafucka!
Remember? Mothafucka never loved us
I'm on my worst behavior! Don't you ever get it fucked up!
Mothafuckas never loved us! Man, mothafuckas never loved us
Worst behavior! Mothafuckas never loved us
Fucka never loved us! Worst behavior

[Verse 2]
Hold up, hold my phone
Mothafuckas never loved us
Fucka never loved us
Now you want to roll one
Mothafucka never loved us
So everywhere we go now, full cup
Always hated the boy, but now the boy is the man
Mothafucka, I done growed up
You know me? You know me?
I'm liable to do anything
When it comes to that you owe me
You owe me, you owe me
Bitch, you better have my money
When I come for that shit like O.D.B

[Chorus]
On my worst behavior, no? They used to never want to hear us
Remember? Mothafucka never loved us
Remember? Mothafucka!
Remember? Mothafucka never loved us
I'm on my worst behavior! Don't you ever get it fucked up!
Mothafuckas never loved us! Man, mothafuckas never loved us
Worst behavior! Mothafuckas never loved us
Fucka never loved us! Worst behavior

[Verse 3]
Who's hot, who not? Tell me who rock, who sell out in stores?
You tell me who flop, who copped the new drop, whose jewels got rocks
Who else making rap albums, doing numbers like it's pop?
Same old pimp, Drake, you know ain't nothin' changed
With these funny style niggas, we done put on in the game
I just ask for some blessings at my grandmother's grave
Then it's back to L.A., open the mail, starin' at the check
Enough to make you throw up, man, it's gross what I net
I'm with my whole set, tennis matches at the crib
I swear I could beat Serena when she playin' with her left
Oh, where I reside it look like a resort inside
Nigga, where your shit from? I imported mine
Bar mitzvah money like my last name Mordecai
Fuck you bitch, I'm more than high
My momma probably hear that and be mortified
This ain't the son you raised who used to take the Acura
5 a.m. then go and shoot Degrassi up on Morningside
For all the stuntin', I'll forever be immortalized
Yeah, back and forth across the borderline
Hate to leave the city, but I've got to do the overtime
Gone all the time, even the important times
I should let you know ahead I'm comin' back on my worst behavior

[Outro]
Remember? Remember? Mothafucka, remember?
Hold up, hold my phone, they used to never want to hear us
Remember? Mothafucka never loved us
Remember? Mothafucka, remember? Worst behavior

[Intro: Drake]
Looking, looking, looking
Looking, looking, looking
Looking, looking
Looking
Looking

[Chorus: Drake]
Looking for revenge
All summer sixteen
All summer sixteen
Playing dirty not clean
Out in front of Four Seasons
Looking like a damn football team
All in the same thing
All repping one thing
Looking for revenge

[Verse 1: Drake]
To do what you couldn't do
Tell Obama that my verses are just like the whips that he in
They bulletproof
Minus twenty we in Pitfield
That Kai's kitchen in a Canada Goose
Famous as fuck but I'm still in the cut when they round up the troops
I'm just a sicko, a real sicko when you get to know me nigga
I let the diss record drop, you was staying right below me, nigga
We must have played it a hundred times, you was going to bed
Why would I put on a vest? I expect you to aim for the head
I coulda killed you the first time
You don't have to try and say it louder nigga
Trust, we heard you the first time
It's nothing personal I would have done it to anyone
And I blame where I came from
And I blame all my day ones
You know Chubbs like Draymond
You better off not saying nothing
Them boys they a handful
Then I hit 'em with the Hotline
Chris Breezy with the dance moves
Mo-G with the dance moves
Ave Boy with the dance moves
Jimi Hendrix with the solo
Those are strings that you can't pull
Yeah, and I could really dish it out
Come and get it from the source
Fuck with all the word of mouth
Golden State running practice at my house
Nigga, what am I about?
You gon' really feel it now
I'm out here'

[Chorus: Drake]
Looking for revenge
All summer sixteen
All summer sixteen
Playing dirty not clean
Out in front of Four Seasons
Looking like a damn football team
All repping one thing
Looking for revenge

[Beat switch]

[Verse 2: Drake]
All you boys in the new Toronto want to be me a little
All your exes know I like my O's with a V in the middle
You would love it if I went away or didn't say nothing else
How am I keeping it real by keeping this shit to myself?
You was never gang, gang, gang, gang, you was never one of us
Had us fooled for a minute there, now we done all grown up
But I'm better off anyway, y'all never gon' finish Drake
Say you seeing 'bout it when you see me man y'all never home anyway
Thought of things that you shoulda said, said things that you shouldn't say
We even gave y'all the whole money play and y'all broke to this day
'Oh it's your time now' yeah, that's what everybody say
I used to wanna be on Roc-A-Fella then I turned into Jay
Now I got a house in LA, now I got a bigger pool than Ye
And look man, Ye's pool is nice, mine's just bigger's what I'm saying
I'm that nigga's what I'm saying
Getting things done around here
How you let me run it down here?
I'm not even from around here
Six, six, six, six, six, soon as I'm back in the city they throw a parade
I might get a key to the city and give it to Wayne
Or give it to one of the young boys to carry the wave
Yeah, so trust me, they'll be out here'

[Chorus: Drake]
Looking for revenge
All summer sixteen
All summer sixteen
Playing dirty not clean
Out in front of Four Seasons
Looking like a damn football team
All repping one thing
Looking for...

[Outro: DJ Khaled]
They don't want us to have a bigger pool than Kanye

[Intro: Drake]
Yeah
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
Look, look

[Verse 1: Drake]
I don't know why they been lyin'
But your shit is not that inspirin'
Bank account statement  just look like
I'm ready for early retirement
Fuck any nigga that's talking that shit just to get a reaction
Fuck going platinum
I look at my wrist and it's already platinum
I am the kid with the motor mouth
I am the one you should worry 'bout
I don't know who you're referring to
Who is this nigga you heard about?
Someone just talking that bullshit
Man, someone just gave you the run-around
Niggas downplayin' the money
But that's what you do when the money down
I don't waste time puttin' money down
I just go straight to who got it and buy it in cash
Pussy so good that you gotta come see me on tour
And you gotta fly in first class
This has been years in the makin'
It's all for the city, they know I come right every summer
Cash Money Records forever, I'm always big timin'
Bitch, I came up right under Stunna, you know it

[Chorus: Drake]
Jealousy in the air tonight, I could tell
I will never understand that, but oh well
Been ready, it's real, I don't know 'bout you
She just want to smoke and fuck
I said "Girl, that's all that we do."
Okay, now you're talkin' my language
Now you're talkin' my language
Now you're talkin' my language
Now you're talkin' my language
Been ready, it's real, I don't know 'bout you
She just want to smoke and fuck
I said "Girl, that's all that we do."

[Verse 2: Drake]
I'm 'bout to roll one and light it
And fuck it, man, no one's invited
I got to kill off the weak shit
That's got all you niggas excited
I can't even listen, you wildin'
I'd much rather sit here in silence
I send all my money to banks in the islands
And eat with Italians, I do
People are funny, you don't even know
'Bout the shit that I been through
I just want some head in a comfortable bed
It could all be so simple
Talkin' that shit with your back to me
Just know it always get back to me
Come get your girl, she been here for three days
And she way too attached to me
Hate when they get too attached to me
I got to get on the bus and get back on the road
Get what I can out the country
And then I just get on the jet and go back to the cold
Can't even drive with the top off
I been workin' so hard on the album, I missed the whole summer
I just might bring in some girls from Miami
To heat up the city, and that's word to Stunna, you know it

[Chorus: Drake]
Jealousy in the air tonight, I could tell
I will never understand that, but oh well
Been ready, it's real, I don't know 'bout you
She just want to smoke and fuck
I said "Girl, that's all that we do."
Okay, now you're talkin' my language
Now you're talkin' my language
Now you're talkin' my language
Now you're talkin' my language
Been ready, it's real, I don't know 'bout you
She just want to smoke and fuck
I said "Girl, that's all that we do."

[Outro: Birdman & Drake]
Famous and dangerous, you understand me?
Showtime, headlines, Big Tyme
"Sunshine," tote 9's, bust mines
Flatline, hard grind, high life
Stay fly, it's jet time ' stunt, nigga!
Every time you see a nigga ' stunt, nigga!
Every time you see a nigga ' stunt, nigga!
Swag on head to feet nigga ' stunt, nigga!
I just might bring in some girls from Miami
To heat up the city, and that's word to Stunna, you know it

[Verse 1: Drake]
Look, I know girls love Beyonc'
Girls love to fuck with your conscience
Girls hate when niggas go missing
And shawty you ain't no different
These days it's hard to meet women
Feel like my love life is finished
I've been avoiding commitment
That's why I'm in this position
I'm scared to let somebody in on this
No new friends, no, no, no
You know how this shit go
You got your fair share of admirers that call your phone
You try to act like it's just me, but I am not alone
But if you're alone, then

[Chorus: James Fauntleroy, James Fauntleroy & Drake]
Say my name, say my name
When no one is around you
Say, "Baby, I love you"
If you ain't running games
Say my name, say my name
You actin' kinda shady, baby
Why the sudden change?
Say my name
Say my name
Say my name
Say my name, say my name
If no one is around you

[Verse 2: Drake]
Yeah, uh
Say my name, say my name
'Cause those other men are practice
And this ain't no time for actin'
And this ain't no time for games
And this ain't no time for uncertainty
And this ain't no time for locking your phone and not coming home
And startin' some shit when I'm in the zone
This is why I've been saying
No new friends, no, no, no
You know how this shit goes
This is not four years ago
Time escapes me
Now forget how it felt when this shit move slow
I come through in whips that make a young boy take the long way home
All my young boys 'round me saying, "Get money and fuck these hoes"
Where we learn these values? I do not know what to tell you
I'm just trying to find a reason not to go out every evening
I need someone that'll help me think of someone besides myself
I need someone I leave through the front door with
'Cause we don't wanna hide no more
Plus you're not shy no more
Neither of us wanna play the side no more
No, I'm not alone
Even though nothing was the same
Let me get your ass alone
Let me make you say my name
Say my name

[Chorus: James Fauntleroy]
Say my name, say my name
When no one is around you
Say, "Baby, I love you"
If you ain't running games
Say my name, say my name
You actin' kinda shady, baby
Why the sudden change?
Say my name
Say my name
Say my name
Say my name, say my name
If no one is around you

[Intro]
That's the shit I'm talking 'bout though, like you changed up, you don't even fuckin' link nobody no more, you just dash me away like a cyattie. Yo, you cheesed me dog

[Verse 1]
Always felt like my vision been bigger than the bigger picture
Crazy how you gotta wait until it's dark out to see who really with you
Crazy how even when it miss you
Shit'll come back around and get you
Crazy like all my niggas, crazy like all my niggas
Remember I deleted all my other girls' numbers out the phone for you?
Remember when you had to take the bar exam
I drove in the snow for you? Yeah
You probably don't remember half the shit a nigga did for you, yeah

[Chorus]
Yeah, you ain't really fuck with me way back then
But how 'bout now? (Now)
'Cause I'm up right now (I'm up right now)
And you stuck right now (Stuck right now)
Oh, you thought you had it all figured out back then
But how 'bout now? (Now)
'Cause I'm up right now (I'm up right now)
And you stuck right now, yeah (Stuck right now)
You thought the little effort that you put in was enough, girl
How 'bout now? Yeah
Girl, how 'bout now, how 'bout now, girl?
What about now, girl, how 'bout now?

[Interlude]
My heart belongs to you...

[Verse 2]
Yeah, always been daddy's little angel
I bought your dad a bunch of shit for Christmas
He ain't even say thank you
I had no money left from actin', I was focused on the music
I used to always try and burn you CDs of my new shit
You be like "who's this?" I be like "me, girl"
You be like "oh, word, true shit?"
Then ask if we could listen to Ludacris
Them car rides made me feel like I was losin' it
Yeah, made me feel I ain't have it like that
Or I was average like that
Started drinkin' way more than I used to
People form habits like that, girl
Yeah, man enough to tell you I was hurt that year
I'm not even Christian, I still went to church that year
Guess I just had to pretend that year
I ain't even see my friends that year
Places that I should've been

[Chorus]
Yeah, you ain't really fuck with me way back then
But how 'bout now? (Now)
'Cause I'm up right now (I'm up right now)
And you stuck right now (Stuck right now)
Oh, you thought you had it all figured out back then
Girl, how 'bout now? (Now)
'Cause I'm up right now (I'm up right now)
And you stuck right now, yeah (Stuck right now)
You thought the little effort that you put in was enough, girl
How 'bout now? Yeah
Girl, how 'bout now, how 'bout now, girl?
What about now, girl, how 'bout now?

[Outro]
My heart belongs to you
Whatever you need, there's nothin' I won't do
Whatever you need, there's nothin' I won't do
Whatever you need, there's nothin' I won't do
Whatever you need, there's nothin' I won't do

[Chorus: Sampha]
Don't think about it too much, too much, too much, too much
There's no need for us to rush it through
Don't think about it too much, too much, too much, too much
This is more than just a new lust for you
(Oohh, don't think about..)

[Verse 1: Drake]
Done sayin' I'm done playin'
Last time was on the outro
Stuck in the house, need to get out more
I've been stackin' up like I'm fundraising
Most people in my position get complacent
Wanna come places with star girls, and they end  up on them front pages
I'm quiet with it, I just ride with it
Moment I stop having fun with it, I'll be done with it
I'm the only one that's putting shots up
And like a potluck, you need to come with it
Don't run from it, like H-Town in the summertime, I keep it 100
Met a lot of girls in my times there, word to Paul Wall, not one fronted
I was birthed there in my first year, man I know that place like I come from it
Backstage at Warehouse in '09 like "Is Bun coming?
Fuck that, is anyone comin' 'fore I show up there and there's no one there?"
These days, I could probably pack it for like twenty nights if I go in there
Back rub from my main thing, I've been stressed out
Talkin' to her like back then they didn't want me, I'm blessed now
Talkin' to her like this drop, bet a million copies get pressed out
She tell me, "Take a deep breath, you're too worried about being the best out"

[Chorus: Sampha]
Don't think about it too much, too much, too much, too much
There's no need for us to rush it through
Don't think about it too much, too much, too much, too much
This is more than just a new lust for you
(Oohh, don't think about..)

[Verse 2: Drake]
Someone go tell Noel to get the Backwoods
Money got my whole family going backwards
No dinners, no holidays, no nothin'
There's issues at hand that we're not discussin'
I did not sign up for this
My uncle used to have all these things on his bucket list
And now he's actin' like, "Oh, well, this is life, I guess," Nah, fuck that shit
Listen man, you can still do what you wanna do, you gotta trust that shit
Heard once that in dire times when you need a sign, that's when they appear
Guess since my text message didn't resonate, I'll just say it here
Hate the fact my mom cooped up in her apartment, telling herself
That she's too sick to get dressed up and go do shit, like that's true shit
And all my family from the M-Town that I've been 'round, started treating me like I'm "him" now
Like we don't know each other, we ain't grow together, we just friends now
Shit got me feeling pinned down, pick the pen up or put the pen down
I'm writing to you from a distance like a pen pal, but we've been down

[Chorus: Sampha]
Don't think about it too much, too much, too much, too much
There's no need for us to rush it through
Don't think about it too much, too much, too much, too much
This is more than just a new lust for you
Ohhh, don't think about it too much, too much, too much, too much
There's no need for us to rush it through, ohhh
Don't think about it too much, too much, too much, too much
This is more than just a new lust for you, ohhh,ohhh
(Don't do that..)

[Outro: Sampha]
Don't give up, on your hopes
And you tell me somethin's gone wrong
Wholehearted, wholehearted, you care, you care
Cause I'm such a dreamer, a believer in a sense
Well if it's all a dream
Then I'm on fire, feels like, I'm on fire
Tell me when I'm lyin', tell me when I'm tryin'

[Produced by Noah "40" Shebib]

[Verse 1]
I can see it in your eyes, you're angry
Regret got shit on what you're feelin' now
Mad cause he ain't like me
Oh you mad cause nobody ever did it like me
All the care I would take
All the love that we made
Now you're trying to find somebody to replace what I gave to you
It's a shame you didn't keep it
Alisha, Catya, I know that you gon' hear this
I'm the man, yeah I said it
Bitch, I'm the man, don't you forget it
The way you walk, that's me
The way you talk, that's me
The way you've got your hair up, did you forget that's me?
And the voice in your speaker right now that's me
That's me, and the voice in your ear
That's me, can't you see
That I made it? Yeah, I made it
First I made you who you are and then I made it
And you're wasted with your latest
Yeah, I'm the reason why you always getting faded

[Chorus]
Take a shot for me (Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh)
Take a shot for me (Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh)
Take a shot for me (Uh-huh, uh-huh, oh-whoa, oh, whoa)
A shot for me (Uh-huh, uh-huh, oh-whoa, oh, whoa)
A shot for me

[Verse 2]
Ok, look, I'm honest. Girl, I can't lie, I miss you
You and the music were the only things that I'd commit to
I never cheated, for the record, back when I was with you
But you believed in everything but me, girl, I don't get you
She says "I know you changed
I never see you cause you're always busy doing things"
I really wish she had a different way of viewing things
I think the city that we're from just kinda ruined things
It's such a small place; not much to do but talk and listen
The men are jealous and the women all in competition
And all your friends telling you stories that you often misin-terpret
And taint all the images of your "Mr. Perfect"
I could tell that you been crying all night, drinking all summer
Prayin' for your happiness, hope that you recover
This is one I know you hated when you heard it
And it's worse because you know that I deserve it

[Chorus]
Take a shot for me (Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh)
Take a shot for me (Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh)
Take a shot for me (Uh-huh, uh-huh, oh-whoa, oh, whoa)
A shot for me (Uh-huh, uh-huh, oh-whoa, oh, whoa)
A shot for me

[Outro]
Yeah
May your neighbors respect you
Trouble neglect you
Angels protect you
And heaven accept you

[Intro]
Yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
When I pull up on a nigga tell that nigga back, back
I'm too good with these words, watch a nigga backtrack
If I die, all I know is I'm a mothafuckin' legend
It's too late for my city, I'm the youngest nigga reppin'

[Chorus]
Oh my God, oh my God, if I die, I'm a legend
Oh my God, oh my God, if I die, I'm a legend

[Verse 1]
I'm up first, I'm on tour, got a girl, she from the South
Used to work, used to dance in Texas, now she clean the house
Everyday, I was strugglin' to learn what life's about
On my way, money taught me Spanish, make it andale
Way up north, packed in Honda cars
They don't know who we are
Fuck 'em all, they only pussy niggas shootin' at the star
Right or wrong, I'ma write my wrongs
They can't live this long
You don't know where you're gonna go
I got this shit mapped out strong

[Pre-Chorus]
When I pull up on a nigga tell that nigga back, back
I'm too good with these words, watch a nigga backtrack
All I know, if I die, I'm a mothafuckin' legend
It's too late for my city, I'm the youngest nigga reppin'

[Chorus]
Oh my God, oh my God, if I die, I'm a legend
Oh my God, oh my God, if I die, I'm a legend

[Verse 2]
I'm the one, one
Why do I feel like the only one?
Why do I feel like you owe me one?
6 G-O-D, I'm the holy one
Yeah, you know wassup, yeah
They been off for a minute now
You know they all sentimental now
You know they all actin' different now
And I, I just can't pretend
Seen too much, it's so hard for me to let new people in
I can't change, this shit set in stone
They can't live this long
You don't know where you're gonna go
I got this shit mapped out strong

[Pre-Chorus]
When I pull up on a nigga tell that nigga back, back
I'm too good with these words, watch a nigga backtrack
All I know, if I die, I'm a mothafuckin' legend

[Chorus]
Oh my God, oh my God, if I die, I'm a legend

[Outro]

[Intro: Drake & Baka Not Nice]
Murda on the beat so it's not nice
Yeah
It's a Habibis ting, ya?

[Verse 1: Drake]
Yeah, my side girl got a 5S with the screen cracked
Still hit me back right away, better not never hesitate
Don't come around thinkin' you gettin' saved
Tryna show the dogs brighter days
Got a torch, tryna light the way
Bitin' everybody, which is ironic
'Cause your next album probably won't ever see the light of day
Had fans, but you let 'em down
But I guess that's how you niggas gettin' down
I'm so high up I'm like, "How is niggas really gettin' down?"
I could never have a kid, then be out here still kiddin' round
Boys playin' around, where you really wanna take it now?
I got a 150,000 dollars for an afterparty
And I gave it to the killas just to break it down
Bring us up, I never take us down
But if you bring me up, then they might take you down
Fake fucked with me back then
But it's gettin' hard for you to fake it now
Fuck bein' rich when I'm forty, man, I'm tryna make it now

[Chorus: Quavo]
Hell nah
Never let these niggas ride your wave
Nope, no way, nah
Never let these niggas ride your wave
Nope, no way, nah
Park the Benz just to the ride the Wraith
Skrrt skrrt
Ten million dollars, gotta hide the safe

[Post-Chorus: Quavo]
Skrrt skrrt, oh
Michael Phelps with the swim moves
Skrrt skrrt, oh

Switch it up, they bit the last move (Let's go!)
I'm a magnet for bad bitches (Magnet)
You got the goin' out sad bitches (Sad)
I spent a fifty on the chain (Racks)
You spent your last fifty (Ugh, cash)
I got the keys to the streets (Keys)
You got the key to defeat (Defeated)
I got the keys to the warzone (Brrapt)
You got the key to the peace (Ugh)

[Chorus: Quavo]
Hell nah
Never let these niggas ride your wave
Nope, no way, nah
Never let these niggas ride your wave
Nope, no way, nah
Park the Benz just to ride the Wraith

We gon' go live, we gon' go live, yep (Yeah, yeah)
Gettin' loose (Yeah) off the Henny, 'Roc and a hint of Goose (Yeah)
Ocean deep in my swimmin' pool (Yeah, in my pool)

[Verse 3: Travis Scott]
Throwin' Dead Prez in my livin' room (Yeah, in my room)
Takin' shots, feelin' bulletproof
Flood my Rollie, told my bitch: "Let's go snorkelin'!" (Yeah)
Out in Portland, tryna get in her organs (Yeah)
No, I did not sign with Jay
But I still send a Tidal wave
Yeah, I might just go get the fade
Buy the du-rag and just tie the waves
Yeah, it's lit at the crib, you could stay
Me and Drake kick like Kid N' Play (Kid N' Play)
God, the way that she servin' that cake
I gotta sit back and digest (Straight up)
I guess for the fuck shit, I'm biased (Yeah)
I mix, double the cup when I stress
Got my mama out the basement (Mama)
That's a different type of face lift
Free Max B up out the bracelets (Yeah, yeah)
Don't hit us askin' what the wave is

[Chorus: Quavo]
Hell nah
Never let these niggas ride your wave
Nope, no way, nah
Never let these niggas ride your wave
Nope, no way, nah
Park the Benz just to the ride the Wraith
Skrrt skrrt

[Intro: Lil Juice]
Tay Keith, fuck these niggas up!

[Verse 1: Drake]
Look, I just flipped a switch (Flipped, flipped)
I don't know nobody else that's doin' this
Bodies start to drop, ayy (Hit the floor)
Now they wanna know me since I hit the top, ayy
This a Rollie, not a stopwatch, shit don't ever stop
This the flow that got the block hot, shit got super hot, ayy
Give me my respect (Give me my respect)
I just took it left like I'm ambidex'
Bitch, I move through London with the Eurostep (Two)
Got a sneaker deal and I ain't break a sweat
Catch me 'cause I'm gone (Outta there, I'm gone)
How I go from 6 to 23 like I'm LeBron?
Servin' up a pack (Servin' up a pack)
Niggas pullin' gimmicks 'cause they scared to rap, ayy
Funny how they shook, ayy, got these niggas shook
Pullin' back the curtain by myself, take a look, ayy
I'm a bar spitta, I'm a hard hitta
Yeah I'm light-skinned, but I'm still a dark nigga
I'm a wig splitta, I'm a tall figure
I'm a unforgivin' wild-ass dog nigga
Somethin' wrong with 'em, got 'em all bitter
I'm a bill printer, I'm a gravedigger
Yeah, I am what I am
I don't have no time for no misunderstandings again

[Chorus: Mack Daddy Ju & Drake]
My head is spinnin', from smokin' the chicken, the bass is kickin'
My head is spinnin', from smokin' the chicken, the bass is kickin'
My head is spinnin', from smokin' the chicken, the bass is kickin'
My head is spinnin'
This a Rollie, not a stopwatch, shit don't ever stop
From smokin' the chicken, the bass is kickin'
My head is spinnin', from smokin' the chicken, the bass is kickin'
My head is spinnin', from smokin' the chicken, the bass is kickin'
My head is spinnin', from smokin' the chicken, the bass is kickin'

[Verse 2: Drake]
Future took the business and ran it for me
I let Ollie take the owl, told him brand it for me
I get 2 million a pop and that's standard for me
Like I went blind, dog, you gotta hand it to me
(Gotta gimme that shit, dog)
Prayed, then I prayed again (Amen, Lord)
Had a moment but it came and went
(They don't love you no more)
You don't wanna play with him (Nah, nah, nah)
They'll be mournin' you like 8AM (R.I.P.)
Pinky ring 'til I get a wedding ring (Whoa, yeah)
Love my brothers, cut 'em in on anything (Big slice)
And you know it's King Slime Drizzy, damn (Woo yeah)
She just said I'm bae, I hit the thizzle dance (Mac Dre shit)
Either hand is the upper hand (Oh yeah, shit)
Got a bubba on my other hand (Whoa, yeah, shit, yeah)
This shit ain't no hundred bands (Nah, nah, nah, nah)
Palace look like Buckingham
Bills so big, I call 'em Williams, for real
Reasons to go crazy, got a trillion, for real
They been tryin' me but I'm resilient, for real
I can't go in public like civilian, for real
And I hardly take offense
Money for revenge, man, that's hardly an expense
Al Haymon checks off of all of my events
I like all the profit, man, I hardly do percents (I don't do that shit)
A big part of me resents
Niggas that I knew from when I started in this shit
They see what I got and, man, it's hard to be content
Fuck what they got goin' on, I gotta represent (Ayy!)

[Chorus: Mack Daddy Ju & Drake]
My head is spinnin', from smokin' the chicken, the bass is kickin'
My head is spinnin', from smokin' the chicken, the bass is kickin'
My head is spinnin', from smokin' the chicken, the bass is kickin'
My head is spinnin'
This a Rollie, not a stopwatch, shit don't ever stop
From smokin' the chicken, the bass is kickin'
My head is spinnin', from smokin' the chicken, the bass is kickin'
My head is spinnin', from smokin' the chicken, the bass is kickin'
My head is spinnin'
This the flow that got the block hot, shit got super hot

[Verse 1: Drake]
Right, my yiy just changed
You just buzzed the front gate
I thank God you came
How many more days could I wait?
I made plans with you
And I won't let 'em fall through
I, I, I, I, I

[Chorus: Drake]
I think I'd lie for you
I think I'd die for you
Jodeci "Cry for You"
Do things when you want me to

[Verse 2: Drake]
Okay, you like it, when I get

[Bridge: Drake]
And I'm never on a waste ting, shawty

They don't want me to give you nothing
They don't want you to have nothing
They don't wanna see me find your lovin'
They don't wanna see me
Smiling back when they pree

Knowing I'd lie for you

But you can't just diss and come tell man sorry
You can't listen to me talk and go tell my story, nah
It don't work like that when you love somebody
My old flex is my new flex now and we're workin' on it, yeah
And that's why I need
All the energy that you bring to me
My last girl would tear me apart
But she'd never wanna split a ting with me

[Chorus: Drake]
But when it comes to you, you
I think I'd lie for you
I think I'd die for you
Do things when you want me to

They want me gone, wait for the kicker
Bury me now and I only get bigger
That's word to my nigga (Woo!)

[Verse 1: Drake & Baka Not Nice]
Yeah, October Firm in the cut (Yah!)
Stay at the top like I'm stuck, that's just how I'm givin' it up
She wanna get married tonight
But I can't take a knee, 'cause I'm wearin' all white
Me and my broski are twins, but we don't look alike
I don't take naps
Me and the money are way too attached to go and do that
Muscle relax (Ha! Ha! Ha!)
That and the spliff put me right on my back, I gotta unpack (Yah!)
Virginia Black (Doo! Doo!)
I could go make enough money off that and not even rap
What's that? Facts? (Yah!)
Contract max, I gotta bring that shit back (Blah!)

[Chorus: Drake & Baka Not Nice]
Herm's link (Woo! Woo!), ice-blue mink (Yah!)
Tat on my ribs like I do not know what permanent is
They want me gone, out of the picture (Yah!)
Bury me now and I only get bigger
That's word to my, word to my'

[Verse 2: Drake & Baka Not Nice]
I'm so hot, yeah, I'm so right now (Right now)
Who's not gang, bitch? Let me find out (Ha!)
Keep hearin' clicks when I'm talkin' on the iPhone
Feds in the city hate to see us on a high note (Woo!)
I switch flow like I switch time zone
Can't get Nobu, but you can get Milestone (Baka)
I got a new mansion, 'cause I outgrew the condo
Gotta do Maybach, she wanna fuck on the drive home
Yeah, met her once and I got through (Yah!)
I'm never washed, but I'm not new
I know I said top five, but I'm top two
And I'm not two and I got one
Thought you had one, but it's not one, nigga, nah

[Chorus: Drake & Baka Not Nice]
Herm's link, ice-blue mink (Yah!)
Tat on my ribs like I do not know what permanent is
They want me gone (Gone, blah!), wait for the kicker
Bury me now and I only get bigger
That's word to my nigga (Woo! Woo!)
Yah!

[Intro: DMX]
What these bitches want from a nigga?

[Verse 1: Drake]
On some DMX shit
I group DM my exes
I tell 'em they belong to me, that goes on for forever
And I think we just get closer when we not together
You tell me that I'm confusin'
More immature than Marques Houston
Cuts too deep for a band-aid solution
We too deep in this thing, you'll never lose me
LOLOL, I'm glad you find this shit amusin'
Heard a lot about me 'fore we started off
I know you heard that my pool parties like Mardi Gras
I know you heard that my girl is sponsored by Audemars
That's why she always correctin' me when my time is off
And my house is the definition
Of alcohol and weed addiction
You got a different vision
You wanna walk around naked in the kitchen
Without runnin' into one of my niggas
That's not the way we livin'
Too much goin' on, it's just not realistic
These days I don't talk 'bout them days like I miss 'em
And you shouldn't miss 'em either, we different people
But every time we speakin'

[Chorus: Drake]
It's like a lot of games bein' played
How's it goin' down?
If it's on 'til we gone, then I gots to know now
Is you wit' me or what?
Yeah
It's like a lot of games are bein' played
How's it goin' down?
If it's on 'til we gone, then I gots to know now
Is you wit' me or what?
Yeah

[Verse 2: Drake]
I wanna know how much time you spent on them paragraphs
Where you're getting me
All that grey in our conversation history, you
Playin' mind games, when you sayin' things
Playin' mime games, we both doin' the same thing
Slide on a late night
You like to slide on a late night
You sent a "Are you here?" text without an invite
That's that shit that I don't like
We both slide on a late night
Do things in our off time
We both, yeah
Made some mistakes, pon road
Yeah, how's that for real?
You toyin' with it like Happy Meal
3 dots, you thinkin' of a reaction still
While you're typin', make sure you tell me

[Chorus: Drake]
What type of games are bein' played?
How's it goin' down?
If it's on 'til we gone, then I gots to know now
Is you wit' me or what?
Yeah
What type of games are bein' played?
How's it goin' down?
If it's on 'til we gone, then I gots to know now
Is you wit' me or what?
Yeah

[Verse 3: Drake]
Yeah, remember you was livin' at The London for a month
Service elevator up to 4201
We was still a secret, couldn't come in through the front
Girl, I had your back when all you used to do was front
That's for sure though, I made a career off reminiscin'
Time got a funny way of tickin', things are so much different
I'll admit it, I've admitted to a lot of things
Act like you know it, fuck them stories, fuck the shade they throwin'
Understand I got responsibilities to people that I need
And on my way to make this dough
A lot of niggas cut the check so they can take this flow
A lot of niggas cut the check so they can take this flow
Ohhh, ohhh
Tryna give your ass the world
You runnin' your fingers through my curls
You knew me when the kid had waves
But that's enough of that
You could never say I came up and forgot about your ass
And that's some real shit

[Intro: PARTYNEXTDOOR]
Own it
It's yours
It's yours

[Verse 1: Drake]
Yours... You're still the one that I adore
Ain't much out there to have feelings for
Guess whose it is? Guess whose it is?
Guess whose it is? Guess whose it is? Yours
A few bottles on the table, a few waters
It ain't a secret, baby, everybody saw us
Guess whose it is? Guess whose it is?
Guess whose it is? It's yours
Next time we fuck, I don't wanna fuck, I wanna make love
Next time we talk, I don't wanna just talk, I wanna trust
Next time I stand tall, I wanna be standin' for you
And next time I spend I want it all to be for you
Peakin', I'm peakin'
Wake up with me this weekend, we can, oh
Guess whose it is? Guess whose it is?
Guess whose it is? It's yours

[Hook: PARTYNEXTDOOR]
Own it, own it, own it, own it, own it, own it, own it, own it
Own it, own it, own it, own it, own it, own it, own it, I said
Go own that shit, own that shit, own that shit, own that shit
Go and own that shit, own that shit, own that shit, you own that shit, go and
Own it, own it, own it, own it, own it, own it, own it, own it
Own it, own it, own it, own it, own it, own it, own it, I said
Go own that shit, own that shit, own that shit, own that shit
Go and own that shit, own that shit, own that shit, you own that shit, go and

[Verse 2: Drake]
Niggas talk more than bitches these days
Just let that shit sink in, ha!
Niggas talk more than bitches these days
Who could get the pussy quicker these days
Still straight with the weed and the liquor these days
Cause the new drugs got the kids trippin' these days
Bunch of journalists been searchin' for a story
My ex-girl been searchin' for a "sorry"
Couple bitches tryna have me on the Maury
Like nigga it's yours, you should be supportin'
But where you been at? On tour, gettin' money
Y'all don't even really check for me
You ain't even hit me when that nigga had threats for me, girl
You don't love me, you just say that shit to get to me, girl
Cause you got the Batphone and my workline, you should call
When the last time you did somethin' for the first time?
You done done it all
I swear to God, niggas talk more than bitches these days
Got you thinkin' that I'm different these days
Broken telephone for every single conversation
By the time it gets to you, shit switches these days
It's yours, it's yours, it's yours, it's... it's always gonna be yours

[Outro: PARTYNEXTDOOR]
Own it, own it, own it, own it, own it, own it, own it, own it
Own it, own it, own it, own it, own it, own it, own it, I said
Go own that shit, it's yours, it's yours, own it, own it, own it, own it
Own it, baby, own it, it's yours, own that shit, own that shit, own that shit

[Verse 1]
I might be too strung out on compliments
Overdosed on confidence
Started not to give a fuck and stopped fearin' the consequence
Drinkin' every night because we drink to my accomplishments
Faded way too long, I'm floatin' in and out of consciousness
And they sayin' I'm back, I'd agree with that
I just take my time with all this shit, I still believe in that
I had someone tell me I fell off, ooh, I needed that
And they want to see me pick back up, well, where'd I leave it at?
I know I exaggerated things, now I got it like that
Tuck my napkin in my shirt 'cause I'm just mobbin' like that
You know good and well that you don't want a problem like that
You gon' make someone around me catch a body like that
No, don't do it (Ayy), please don't do it (Ayy)
'Cause one of us goes in, and we all go through it (Ayy)
And Drizzy got the money, so Drizzy gonna pay it
Those my brothers, I ain't even gotta say it
That's just something they know

[Chorus]
They know, they know, they know (They know, ayy)
They know, they know, they know
They know, they know, they know
Yeah, they know, yeah
That the real is on the rise
Fuck them other guys
I even gave 'em a chance to decide
Now it's something they know
They know, they know, they know

[Verse 2]
Yeah!
I be yellin' out, "Money over everything! Money on my mind!"
Then she wanna ask when it got so empty
Tell her I apologize, happened over time
She says, "They miss the old Drake", girl don't tempt me
"If they don't get it, they'll be over you
That new shit that you got is overdue
You better do what you supposed to do"
I'm like, "Why I gotta be all that?"
But still I can't deny the fact that it's true
Listening to you expressin' all them feelings
Soap opera rappers, all these niggas sound like All My Children
And that's who you thinkin' is 'bout to come and make a killin'
I guess it really is just me, myself and all my millions
You know that they ain't even got it like that
You gon' hype me up and make me catch a body like that
'Cause I live for this, it isn't just a hobby like that
When they get my shit and play it
I ain't even gotta say it, they know

[Chorus]
They know, they know, they know (They know)
They know, they know, they know
They know, they know, they know
Yeah, they know, yeah
That the real is on the rise
Fuck them other guys
I even gave 'em a chance to decide
Now it's something they know
They know, they know, they know

[Outro]
I be yelling out "Money over everything!"
"Money on my mind, mind, mind-mind!"
Tell them I apologize, it happened over time, time, time-time
They know
They know, they know, they know
They know, they know, they know
They know, they know, they know
Yeah'

[Outro Poem]
I heard once that they would rather hear about memories than enemies
Rather hear what was or what will be than what is
Rather hear how you got it over how much it cost you
Rather hear about findin' yourself than how you lost you
Rather you make this an open letter
About family, and struggle, and it takin' forever
About hearts that you've broken, and ties that you've severed
No doubt in my mind, that'll make them feel better

Dedicate, I dedicate the world

[Verse 1]
They throwin' dirt on my old name
Only gets worse when you know things
You don't see the perks of this whole thing
But you get real on a pill and I like it
You just like my sidekick, I just wanna ride, fulfill all your desires
Keep you in the front, never in the back and never on the side, uh
(Yeah)

[Chorus 1]
You a real ass woman and I like it
I don't wanna fight it

[Verse 2]
Look, you know I'm a rider, nothin' left to hide
Your other nigga tired
Talk about you like you never leave his side
But I don't really buy it
Me? I'm movin' quiet, all the things we're tryin'
Let's just keep it private (Don't say anything)
Tell me should I cut these other girls right out of my life?
'Cause we never decided, tell me how you feel inside

[Chorus 2]
You a real ass woman and I like it, yeah
Dedicate to you
I need you inspired, I need you excited
I don't wanna fight it

[Verse 3]
Yeah-yeah, I figure out you, you figure out me
We both a different breed
I'm followin' your lead, I ask you what you need
You say, "A guarantee"
I mean, you say that like it's easy
You never believe me
Told you I got Zs for these other girls sleepin' on 'em
Girl, I'm sleepy
Sometimes I'm so indecisive

[Chorus 1]
But you a real ass woman and I like it
I don't wanna fight it

[Outro]
I give you my fortune
I dedicate, I dedicate
I dedicate, I dedicate
I dedicate, dedicate, dedicate
I dedicate to you
I dedicate, I dedicate
This song's for you
I dedicate, I dedicate
I give you my voice
This song's for you

Can't nobody tell me nothin'
You can't tell me nothin'

You can't tell me nothin'

Ain't no more actin', man, that forecast say I should just let me grow

Brand new places I'll choose and I'll go, I know
Embracin' this news I behold unfolding

I know, I know, I know it don't feel like it's time
I set boundaries for myself, it's time to cross the line

True say, I want and I need
To let go, use my time to be free

Ain't no more actin', man, that forecast say I should just let me grow
No more red light for me, baby, only green, I gotta go
Pack my past up in the back, oh, let my future take ahold

How you leave your son all alone?

You niggas is guessing that I will start stressing
Fall back to depression just 'cause yo' rejection

Niggas talking 'bout, "He got potential"
Niggas joining groups, tryna be Avengers
Scared to stand alone, scared to disassemble

Be afraid, hope you do remember
In the Escalade, drinking Ace of Spades
Doing escapades, yeah, I do adventures
Droppin' shit, you know that I'm poppin' shit
I switched up my swag and they copied it
Got in my bag and I pulled off the tag
And I don't mean to brag on my mothafuckin' cocky shit
Niggas is, niggas is wack
Smokin' on crack, I am on fire like Jack
I do the same thing as thugger

Yeah, I put that brack in my brack
Niggas corny, niggas whistle blow
Niggas kiss ass, nigga mistletoe
You gotta thick ass? You should let me know!

Lyrics From Previews

[Chorus]
If I say so, know they gon' ride
I know G's and you know they ain't nice
If I pop up, I'm a wanted, but I get by
Tell the devil I can't have him inside
Tell the reaper he don't want it, he don't want it
Oh, I know everything's gonna be alright
Tell the reaper he don't want it, he don't want it
Oh, I know everything's gonna be alright

[Verse]
I smoked myself to sleep, I'm sad, I think I'm feelin' lonely
Took one too many shots last night and I spent all my money
Oh, my nigga, tell me who said you can't own it?
You can own anything right before your eyes
Oh, my nigga, if you knew that, I'd be on it
Woulda did anything just to spoil my rise
Wanted fame, I just got a ticket
It can happen, can I get a witness?
Started focusin', nothin' but business
I'ma finally see all the riches
I keep things to myself, so I promise they'll never know me
Old people in my life should know that I am not the old me (Old me)

[Chorus]
If I say so, know they gon' ride
I know G's and you know they ain't nice
If I pop up, I'm a wanted, but I get by
Tell the devil I can't have him inside
Tell the reaper he don't want it, he don't want it
Oh, I know everything's gonna be alright
Tell the reaper he don't want it, he don't want it
Oh, I know everything's gonna be alright

Run that money counter, baby, mhm, hmm, hmm
Pour that shit up, Trvpyyy

[Verse 1]
When I get some wins, I'm complacent
Might blow up go buy a new place and
Right now, I still live with my mom and my dad
But I'll skeet on your face in that basement
See, I fuck with crackers and Haitians
I'm rapping, they say he gon' make it
I really think ain't no more rules to this rap shit
I really think Josh could be Drake'ing
They thinkin' that I got hella' guap
Did you love me 'fore I got it? Not
Gucci on my socks
It's too cold, I can't take it off

Nigga moving up, I got my old friends acting friendlier

[Chorus]
Run up them bands up

[Verse 2]
When I get the guap, I'm complacent ('Placent)
You watch what you say, when you say it (Say it)
Lil' nigga, I might just be friends with yo plug
If I give him the paper he lace it (He lace it)
See, I might get head in a Wraith and (In a Wraith and)
Go plot for the world domination ('Mination)
See, I'm tryna get to the tippity-top
To where Kanye and Jay-Z adjacent
I'm poppin', like, I'm already on
Turn this up, this yo favorite song
Lotta niggas on, trashy songs
They won't last too long
'18 set me up for '19
It's gon' be a killer year
Was rich in my past life
All this money look familiar

[Chorus]
Run up them bands up
Run up them bands up

[Intro: Beyonc', Skaiwater & Both]
I don't wanna be without you, babe (Bitch)
I don't want a broken heart
Don't wanna take a breath without you, babe (Young Skai, fuck these niggas talking 'bout?)
I don't want to play that part
I know that I love you, but let me just say (Xtravulous)
I don't wanna love you in no kind of way (Woah)

[Chorus: Skaiwater]
I ain't tryna be the one to hurt you, ayy
Catch you after dark like a curfew
No love, more drugs
No love, more drugs
But, I ain't tryna be the one to hurt you, ayy
Catch you after dark like a curfew, ayy
No drugs, more love
No drugs, more lo'

[Verse: Lil Nas X]
Uh, yeah, I lead you on
Wish I could speak my feelings without running to a song
Yeah, you told me 'bout your mom, that shit ate me up
I could tell you need a shoulder, still didn't give a fuck
I could never get enough, of shittin' on people and just regrettin' it
Barely giving respect, but I want respect, just expecting it
Worried about my future, I'm burning bridges affecting it
People who show me love, I always end up neglecting
You thinking you made me do it, get to you, can't get through it
I know you peepin' my pages, I know you peepin' my music
I know you listening now, find it interesting now
Shit, if I was you, I'd probably feel sickened now
'Cause I left without even saying, you probably thought I was playing
Was I okay or alright, you probably was out here praying
You wanted the best for me, used to get dressed for me
But I can't be with you, I'm addressing my destiny, uh

[Chorus: Skaiwater]
I ain't tryna be the one to hurt you, ayy
Catch you after dark like a curfew
No love, more drugs
No love, more drugs
But, I ain't tryna be the one to hurt you, ayy
Catch you after dark like a curfew, ayy
No drugs, more love
No drugs

[Refrain: Lil Nas X]
Ooh
I need more drugs, ain't no love good for me
I'ma need to be all on my own, think it's good for me
Ooh
I need more drugs, ain't no love good for me
I'ma need to be all on my own, think it's good for me
Good for me

[Outro: Beyonc']
I don't wanna be without you, babe
I don't want a broken heart
Don't wanna take a breath without you, babe
I don't want to play that part
I know that I love you, but let me just say
I don't wanna love you in no kind of way

[Verse 1]
Finish line, huh, finna cross it, yeah, I'm trying, huh

Nobody to guide me, hope this label never trick me, uh
To keep it 100, I can't split this 50/50, uh
I blew by myself, so I might need my riches filthy, uh
Soakin' up all this fame, huh
Old Town just banged, huh
I just hopped in this industry, I think I opened up my own lane, huh
And you know what's real crazy? Huh
Parents told me I was lazy, yeah
Was pushin' shit on the internet, now I'm up there with Lil Baby, uh
Splash, splash, splash, splash, splash, I keep scorin'
Don't send me that link, lil' nigga, you know that it's boring
Crazy how quick I woke all these niggas up from snoring
Crazy how sick they gon' be when I really start soarin'

[Verse 1]
My shit slap, it get you off your feet, off your feet
Nasarati dropped, you got it on repeat, on repeat
They post a shady tweet and then they hit delete, hit delete
I'm who these goofy niggas really wanna be, wanna be
See, you wanna be in front of me
These niggas, they confronting me
I'm running with the money and I'm shunning bums and wannabes
I'm flippin' dough and switchin' flows
I'm rippin' out reciprocals
I'm whippin' in the kitchen with some niggas that's from Mexico
I make a cake, sell it
Buy an eighth, smell it
That's just for this round, I'm cuttin' down on the Henny
You niggas ain't prevailin', tellin' all my felons
Ashamed, but my chain ain't finna do no damn derailin'
I'm the hottest motherfucka', I roll like a trucka'
Doin' shows on these sucka's, I might go and fuck ya' motha'
I might just fuck a cougar, I kill it, Freddy Krueger
Go no where without my ruger
Him right there? Yeah, that's my shooter, uh

[Chorus]
I know you really like it
I see, like I'm a psychic
My shit get lit, excited

Lyrics From Snippet

[Verse 1]
Say you one of me, 'cause I need the validation
Need to watch your speed, think you causin' fascination
Put you in that box, what the fuck you think you sayin'?
If it ain't "Old Town Road," Lil Nassy ain't playin'
Nigga, just stick to what you best at
I suggest, make a song like this
Yep, I'm switching up with pros, lil' nigga you ain't good, huh
Just because you can that ain't meaning that you should, no

[Chorus]
I like this, I don't like that, huh
Do this here, don't you do that, huh
Say you one of me, say you one of me, yeah
Say you one of me, say you one of me, yeah
I like this, I don't like that, huh
Do this here, don't you do that, huh
Say you one of me, say you one of me, yeah
Say you one of me, say you one of me, yeah

[Verse 2]
You's a meme you's a joke, was a gimmick from the go
All the things you would do just to get your face to show
So you think you big shit, big pimping, let me know
Ain't the next big thing, you the next thing to go
Now, can you prove yourself? Everybody waitin'
I'm just being real, swear somebody hatin'
I don't see you lasting long and that's just me being honest
Even if your album okay, it's flopping, that's a promise, oh

[Chorus]
I like this, I don't like that, huh
Do this here, don't you do that, huh
Say you one of me, say you one of me, yeah
Say you one of me, say you one of me, yeah

Ayo, throw that ass back
If you tryna get this money, get this fat stack
I must admit, you is the shit, I wanna grab that
Put that putty on my Woodie, that's a fat cat
Uh, ayo, throw that ass back
If you tryna get this money, get this fat stack
I must admit, you is the shit, I wanna grab that
Put that putty on my Woodie, that's a fat cat

[Verse 1]
Uh, ayo, I guess tonight she going in
Throwin' and she rollin' and she hoein' wit her friends
Slowin' with the motion, gotta hit em with the spins
She ain't showin no emotions, no, she got some thick skin
So I asked her if she ever fucked a rap nigga
Said she did, but they really couldn't rap nigga
Said she was a shooter, so you know she like to clap niggas
Said, "Nas, do you wanna see it clap, nigga?"
Yeah, she a meanie
Her body poppin' like genie
She molly poppin', get steamy
She probably got me, she dreamy
She twerking that fuckin' thang
Her pussy poppin', she creamy
She working up at the flame
She clocking in when she leave me
She building up and she stackin'
Packin' and never lackin'
Ass fillin' up, it's clapping
Throw backwards like it's pig latin
From trenches like she be trappin'
Full of herself, no cappin'
No snitchin', she never yappin'
Hit bitches, she steady slappin', uh!

[Chorus]
Ayo, throw that ass back
If you tryna get this money, get this fat stack
I must admit, you is the shit, I wanna grab that
Put that putty on my Woodie, that's a fat cat
Uh, ayo, throw that ass back
If you tryna get this money, get this fat stack
I must admit, you is the shit, I wanna grab that
Put that putty on my Woodie, that's a fat cat

Yeah, you too, you over there
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse 2]
If you a CNA, a teacher
Twerk that ass all on the bleachers
Cashier or a nurse
Pop that pussy, then disperse
If you a stripper or a maid
Make it clap like a parade
Even if you unemployed
Twerk that ass, fuck what they say
CEO? Gotta degree?
Pop that pussy like Nicki
Even if you a social worker
Man, I know that you a twerker
Retail clerkers?
Them bitches flippin' burgers?
Oh my god, you killin' shit
Issa fuckin murder
This one for da' Rihannas
Them bitches from Weezyana
Them bitches who name is
Quisha, Biancas, and them Briannas
And even in the cabanas
And if you listen to Gunna
Them wifeys and babymamas
Them bitches whippin' a hummer
Oh, hummers all in the summer
Show that ass like plumber
Shake it fast like a Runner
Bitch, do that shit for Obama
Hop on it, cause some drama
Drop it in yo pajamas
Pop it in the Bahamas
You got that shit from yo mama
Uh

[Chorus: Lil Nas X]
They in they feelings
They don't want they spot, nigga I fill in
I feel it coming, I'm running to get my thrill in
I'm sonning these pussy niggas, I'm coming to make a killing

[Verse: Lil Nas X]
I'm a problem, niggas know 'dat
Hop out, grab the black MAC, no Kodak
Rockstar like Jack Black, I'm playing like Mick Jagg
No playing, get rich fast, then sit back
Huh, soak it all in
I spoke it now it's happening, they hope it all end
Niggas rather hate than get in they own bag
It's funny because I always put money over that mad shit
Tell me, tell me what that fuck you gaining from it
Hating while I'm in the club and it's raining money
That shit is draining you, paining your fucking brain and you straining yourself out tryna get all that clout off my name

[Chorus: Lil Nas X]
They in they feelings
They don't want they spot, nigga I fill in
I feel it coming, I'm running to get my thrill in
I'm sonning these pussy niggas, I'm coming to make a killing
They in they feelings
They don't want they spot, nigga I fill in
I feel it coming, I'm running to get my thrill in
I'm sonning these pussy niggas, I'm coming to make a killing

[Outro: Delegation]
When my poor heart is breakin' apart
She'll put it back together
When my poor heart is breakin' apart
She'll put it back together
When my poor heart is breakin' apart
She'll put it back together
When my poor heart is breakin' apart
She'll put it back together

[Intro]
Lando made the track, so you know we 'bout to turn up

[Chorus]
Uh, niggas thinking that they up one
Choppas in the truck, you better go and duck, son
I could give a motherfuck 'bout what you did done
'Cause now I'm taking over, nigga, guess I'm Kim Jong
Uh, niggas thinking that they up one
Choppas in the truck, you better go and duck, son
I could give a motherfuck 'bout what you did done
'Cause now I'm taking over, nigga, guess I'm Kim Jong

[Verse 1]
Thirty niggas with me and they shooting too
Nigga, they will shoot at you
Thus leaving you dead
Bust ya mathafuckin cuticles
Different color Gucci
Nigga I look like Rubik's cube
Putting fake niggas on trial
Like the crucible, delusional niggas
Thinking they up next, that's a shame
'Cause they name ain't Lil Nas X
Young nigga, I was raised in the projects
In the draft, I'm the number one prospect

[Chorus]
Uh, niggas thinking that they up one
Choppas in the truck, you better go and duck, son
I could give a motherfuck 'bout what you did done
'Cause now I'm taking over, nigga, guess I'm Kim Jong
Uh, niggas thinking that they up one
Choppas in the truck, you better go and duck, son
I could give a motherfuck 'bout what you did done
'Cause now I'm taking over, nigga, guess I'm Kim Jong

[Verse 2]
Think I was meant for this rappin' shit
'Cause all the new niggas sent really wack as shit
Maybe if I change the game
I'll aim at lame niggas brains
And take the fame off they names
Then I'll give it back
To a motherfuckin' humble rapper
Conscious niggas always talking 'bout them mumble rappers
Like y'all shit can't be trash too
You niggas be wack too
Pussy fuck ya past, oh
You niggas gassed
My check better be getting to me
Or I'm wetting necks of niggas who didn't give it to me
Don't expect no respect, I never give it truly
Switch the pivot gotta get it, that's how I'm living, ooh-wee

[Chorus]
Uh, niggas thinking that they up one
Choppas in the truck, you better go and duck, son
I could give a motherfuck 'bout what you did done
'Cause now I'm taking over, nigga, guess I'm Kim Jong
Uh, niggas thinking that they up one
Choppas in the truck, you better go and duck, son
I could give a motherfuck 'bout what you did done
'Cause now I'm taking over, nigga, guess I'm Kim Jong

[Intro]
Thank you, Ralph (Thank you, Ralph)

[Verse 1]
I just started rappin'
Niggas acting like we cool
You a fool, think I fuck with you
Just 'cause we went to school
Pockets blue, and I'm rocking trues
I could never lose
Rock with blue and them reds too
I don't fuck with you

[Chorus]
Pussy nigga, you don't know me
Don't even crack a smile
Don't come around me saying
You ain't seen me in a while
Pussy nigga, you don't know me
Don't DM on the gram
I am not your bro, I'm not your moe, I'm not ya fam
Pussy nigga, you don't know me

[Verse 2]
Let me say it loud
Only time I wanna see you is when I see you in the crowd
Tell that bitch, "Look at me now"
It ain't no Chris Brown
But I'm fuckin' poppin' and I fuckin' put it down
What other nigga got my sound?
Point me to his ass
I'm sick of y'all ass calling mid niggas gas
They comin' in last, yeah, in school they didn't pass
Thinking they was cool, 'cause they never went to class
Old peon-lame-ass, nigga, get your check up
Treat you like a ho, you better go get your respect up
I am on the road doin' shows, see me next up
My neck to my toe, I am froze, need a check-up
I think I'm the shit
I'm rich, I'm at the Ritz
I'ma take your bitch
If you don't get up off of my dick

[Chorus]
Pussy nigga, you don't know me
Don't even crack a smile
Don't come around me saying
You ain't seen me in a while
Pussy nigga, you don't know me
Don't DM on the gram
I am not your bro, I'm not your moe, I'm not ya fam
Pussy nigga, you don't know me

[Verse 3]
"My weekend like ya weekday"
I'ma play my mixtape for Drake, see what he say
I am on my way, like a nigga on the freeway
I'ma need my money now, I don't do no free pay
I don't hear no "He say," I don't care what bums say
I'm tryna be up there with them Jiggas and Beyonc's
My hitters pull triggers, go gorilla on a dummy
I'm ya father-figure, little nigga, you my sonny
All I do is win, might commit some sins
Patience running thin, finna bust a nigga chin
I don't understand how these niggas make amends
With niggas that done switched up on them, said they was they friends
All they do is follow trends, tryin' to fit in
That AK give you headache, you can't use no Aspirin

[Chorus]
Pussy nigga, you don't know me
Don't even crack a smile
Don't come around me saying
You ain't seen me in a while
Pussy nigga, you don't know me
Don't DM on the gram
I am not your bro, I'm not your moe, I'm not ya fam
Pussy nigga, you don't know me

[Verse 1]
Uh
Get it, get it, I went and did it again
Rip it, flip it, they say I'm switchin' on friends
They say I'm trippin', forestallin' myself within
I only trip when I trip and fall in that Benz
I'ma bake the feature for the right pricing
Cake the beat, I'm just the right icing
See, I'm inspired by Neil deGrasse Tysons
They inspired by squealers that's doing lifings
I get three hours of sleep, just to get better
These cowards, they out here sour at me, petty vendettas
I ain't ate right or took a pee, waitin' for cheddar
Workin' late night, oh, it's just me, David the letter-man

[Pre-Chorus]
C'mon girl, get up
Come a little bit
C'mon girl, get up
Come a little bit (Bit, bit)
My whole life I was under it!
All-
Che-che-check

[Chorus: Lil Nas X]
Uh, so I'll be damned if I let a pussy take it from me
I'm the man, I'm the rookie, finna make the money
I make 'em dance, throw ya hands up and shake it for me
I'm advanced, man, my fans out here waitin' for me
So I'll be damned if I let a pussy take it from me
I'm the man, I'm the rookie, finna make the money
I make 'em dance, throw ya hands up and shake it for me
I'm advanced, man, my fans out here waitin' for me

[Verse 2]
Uh, I'm doing better so petty shit I just let it go
I'm more focused on leaving sofas to Mexico
Touring Europe and Africa, buzz around the globe
"Nas, can I get back to ya?" bitch, the sound of dough
Is all that I hear
Bitch, I'm really spittin' now, this is my career
Shoutout to the labels flaking on me, fuck they ears
You just lost your best player, 'Bron and Cavaliers, disappear! Uh!
I came to do it
I came to fucking pursue it
They showin' love in this bitch
'Cause I'm blowin' up and they knew it would happen
In this rappin', I'm the new captain
I sat back, perfected my craft while niggas was laughing

[Outro]
Uh

[Intro]
Daytrip took it to 10 (Hey)

[Chorus]
Oh, here we go, please let me know
Off we go, don't leave me in the cold

[Verse]
If I took you everywhere, then well, you wouldn't know how to walk
If I spoke on your behalf, then well, you wouldn't know how to talk
If I gave you everything and everything is what I bought
I can take it all back, I never cared 'bout what you thought
I didn't mean to make you mad, I don't like when you're upset
I'ma call you later on, baby girl, don't you forget
I'ma take you from this party, we might go and have some sex
Or we do that later on, now we lit like cigarettes

[Pre-Chorus]
I thought you would stay with me
I'm yours and you're mine, I envy
So what I'm gon' do?
I don't have no clue, ain't no me without you

[Chorus]
Oh, here we go, please let me know
Off we go, don't leave me in the cold

[Refrain]
If I took you everywhere, then well, you wouldn't know how to walk

Wait, I mean I didn't see shit

They gon' miss me when I leave shit
'Cause all these other rap niggas won't be shit
Uh, I gotta check to stash

Real ass nigga, so I don't fuck with trash
Niggas mad cause I'm making cash

She dropped the pin, sent that 'addy

Said she used to work in finance, nigga, JG Wentworth
She kill 'em with class, shoot they ass in a red skirt, dead hearse
Gotta lotta cholos, that'll steal for her

Her pussy on Marco Polo
Think I gotta feel for her
Say, "Lil Nas, you getting big"
"Can't wait to yo billboards", real noise

Lyrics from Snippet

- let the lights shine bright
Wakeup, I'm cold, livin' life by night
I will never grow 'cause I don't think twice
But these people say I'm cold and they right like ice
I don't parole, but I move like mice
Everybody wanna know how I raise my price

[Verse]
Caught up in the same shit
Tryna keep it low until I get the fame shit
Get the yens, find my yin to my yang shit
With the gang, but I don't really bang shit
Uh, they bidding on me like an auction
Pretty soon, I'ma be they top option
Tell my jeweler, get the cooler when the rocks done
No school, Ferris Bueller, I'm a hot one
Uh, they ain't shit, and they remain shit
They miss, they aimless
Disdain, they main hits
They all the same shit
All the same hit
They disappear in a year on that Blane shit
These niggas is coughin', yes, I kill often
They say they got bars
Where is the warden?
I ball like Boston
Just keep on, just scorin'
I am who they sleep on, they snorin'
Sometimes I really hate switching my flow up
'Cause I know these niggas could rip it and blow up
I'm really out here working hard for my glow up
Broke shit make me sick, make me cough, make me throw up
Can't fuck with these niggas, they pussy, they petty
That top spot for taking, they book me, I'm ready
They said you was next? Well, they must never met me
I'm saucing on niggas, Ragu, like spaghetti

For these sorry ass rap niggas chasin' all the fame

[Post-Chorus]
Give me a bag, bet you I fill it

[Verse 1]
Where you think you at?

[Verse 2]
Niggas got jokes? Well, I'm on your ass
Niggas want smoke? Get ya chimney smashed
Don't feature me on your song
Promise nigga, you will get trashed
I'm Michael Phelps with that tool
Don't let your whole team get splashed
"Damn, he's rash!"
Nah, that's just how I react
In the Maybach, let my seat back
Glove compartment where the piece at
In Bahamas, where the sea at
They tell a nigga to relax
Nah, I can't do that
'Cause I gotta watch my back
They will never catch me lack

[Chorus]
Niggas really on my dick, that's a shame
I don't even know your name, give a fuck who you claim
Nigga, fuck your gang-gang, that clout be the blame
For these sorry ass rap niggas chasin' all the fame

[Intro: Drake]
Astro, yeah

That's how we already know, winter's here
My dawg would probably do it for a Louis belt
That's just all he know, he don't know nothin' else
I tried to show 'em, yeah

[Part II]

[Verse 1: Travis Scott & The Notorious B.I.G.]
Woo, made this here with all the ice on in the booth
At the gate outside, when they pull up, they get me loose
Yeah, Jump Out boys, that's Nike boys, hoppin' out coupes
This shit way too big, when we pull up, give me the loot
(Gimme the loot!)
Was off the Remy, had a Papoose
Had to hit my old town to duck the news
Two-four hour lockdown, we made no moves
Now it's 4 a.m. and I'm back up poppin' with the crew
I just landed in, Chase B mixes pop like Jamba Juice
Different colored chains, think my jeweler really sellin' fruits
And they chokin', man, know the crackers wish it was a noose

[Bridge: Big Hawk & Swae Lee]
Some'Some'Some'Someone said
To win the retreat, we all in too deep
Pl'Pl'Playin' for keeps, don't play us for weak (Someone said)
To win the retreat, we all in too deep
Pl-Pl-Playin' for keeps, don't play us for weak

[Verse 2: Travis Scott & Uncle Luke]
Yeah, this shit way too formal, y'all know I don't follow suit
Stacey Dash, most of these girls ain't got a clue
All of these hoes I made off records I produced
I might take all my exes and put 'em all in a group
Hit my eses, I need the bootch
'Bout to turn this function to Bonnaroo
Told her, "Hop in, you comin' too"
In the 305, bitches treat me like I'm Uncle Luke
(Don't stop, pop that pussy!)
Had to slop the top off, it's just a roof, uh
She said, "Where we goin'?" I said, "The moon"
We ain't even make it to the room
She thought it was the ocean, it's just the pool
Now I got her open, it's just the Goose
Who put this shit together? I'm the glue

[Bridge: Travis Scott, Swae Lee & Big Hawk]
Someone said
Shorty FaceTimed me out the blue
Someone said
Pl'Playin' for keeps

Put the pussy on a pedestal (Ayy)
Put the pussy on a high horse

Say she want real niggas in the party
Parents gon' leave the keys to the condo

[Post-Chorus: NAV]
Bitch, close the door, there's shit on your nose (That coca)
She said she want more, she said she want more
So I'ma get more, yeah, I'ma get more
Bitch, close the door, there's shit on your nose
She said she want more, she said she want more
So I'ma get more, yeah, I'ma get more

[Verse 1: NAV]
I just poured a 8 in a liter
With a white bitch sniffin' on Bieber
Are you sure you want to party with the demons?
Bitch lookin' for a phone, I ain't seen it
Told Frost bring the water, no Fiji
Free Stix, I'm poured up and I'm leanin'
I got a couple pussy niggas in their feelings
'Cause their main bitch wanna come see me
She said she want more
Your girl is a ho, you need to let go
She fucked all my bros, she's snortin' the snow (That coca)
Now she's touchin' her toes

If they kick down the door, we gon' get locked for sure
She said she want more
Fuck it, I'ma get more (I'ma get more)

Pulled out of the hood Toyota
Drove back to the hood Lambo (Ooh)
Crushed Xans, crushed Xans in my soda
Ridin' around the city with my eyes closed (Ooh)

Got a white bitch snortin' up snow
Say she want real niggas in the party
Parents gon' leave the keys to the condo

[Segue]
Got me goin' crazy

[Part II]

[Verse 2]
Okay, I been up for some days, I ain't got time to lay
Just to drown out all these thoughts, I tried all kind of things
If I take you to my past you will be traumatized
Got a thousand kids outside that's tryna come alive
'99, took AstroWorld, it had to relocate
Told the dawgs I'd bring it back, it was a seal of faith
Before no car notes, baby girl, she played the tourist guide
Got the keys into my city, now she know the rides
Got new money, got new problems, got new enemies
When you make it to the top, that's the amenities
Packin' out Toyota like I'm in the league
And it ain't a mosh pit if ain't no injuries
I got 'em stage divin' out the nosebleeds
(Alright, alright, alright)
And she hit that booger sugar 'til her nose bleed
(Alright, alright, alright)
Bounce that shit forever, she on both knees
She was talkin' 'bout forever, got a whole week
(Alright, alright, alright)
Plus she know my baby mama is a trophy
She be throwing up them B's, feel like we both bleed
She keep my dick jumpin' up, feel like I'm Moby
I'm way too gold for this beef, feel like I'm Kobe, yeah
This right here is astronomical
I see you picked up all my ways, I feel responsible
They tryna say that all my problems is improbable
They keep itching at my spirit, I'm diabolical
Ya feel me?

[Chorus: Gunna]
Ice on my neck, flawless baguettes
Hop off a jet, barely get rest
Cash through the month, I get a check
Yves Saint Laurent on my pants and my chest
Chanel, her dress, clean up her mess
I eat her flesh, you know the rest
Count up a hun', cop a Rolex
Shine like the sun, you truly blessed
Two-tone Patek
In the Clearport like I Uber these jets
VVSs on me got my Gucci shirt wet
Put a M in my bag, gon' get used to these racks
I went to school where they teach you finesse
Five hundred shoes for the drip I invest
I'm the boss man, I keep cash in the desk
Know the coupe fast when it end with a S

[Verse: Travis Scott]
Now that I'm home, back off the road
We shut it down, where it ain't so
With checks in the streets, Jay number fours
Saint Laurent feet, put it on toes
Take it with me, double your dose
Covered with angels that's watching my soul
Jet got a bed, it's bigger windows
Said I'll be there in 10 but I got there in four

[Bridge: Travis Scott]
I feel like I'm chosen, I'm covered in gold
Mmm-hm-mmm-hm-mmm-hm-mmm
Mmm-hm-mmm-hm-mmm-hm-mmm
I left her wide open, no self control
Mmm-hm-mmm-hm-mmm-hm-mmm
Mmm-hm-mmm-hm-mmm-hm-mmm
Took nothing but five minutes, she hopped in and drove
Mmm-hm-mmm-hm-mmm-hm-mmm

[Chorus: Gunna & Travis Scott]
Ice on my neck, flawless baguettes
Hop off a jet, barely get rest
Cash through the month, I get a check
Yves Saint Laurent on my pants and my chest
Chanel, her dress, clean up her mess
I eat her flesh, you know the rest
Count up a hun', cop a Rolex
Shine like the sun, you truly blessed (Yeah!)
Two-tone Pateks
In the Clearport like I Uber these jets
VVSs on me got my Louis shirt wet
It's a M in my bag, I'ma get used to these racks (used)
I went to school where they teach you finesse
Five hundred shoes for the drip I invest
I'm the boss man, I keep cash in the desk
Know the coupe fast when it end with a S

[Outro: NAV]
La Flame on a island, me and Cash, Gunna hopped on a Learjet
Got Pradas every color and I got CCs you ain't seen yet
Said I'd kick the cup and now I'm asking, "Where the codeine at?"
30 pointers and up, Eliantte drippin', my whole team wet

[Chorus: Travis Scott & Don Toliver]
No, you can't say if I'm mad or not
Smokin' hella weed, I'm on that alcohol
And shawty lick me clean the way she suck me off

What would you do if you heard I got it going on?
I had to burn, I left skrt marks, I had to dip (I had to)
Gotta watch for 12 'round my town, you might get killed (Better watch for 12)
I'm out my mind, yeah, I'm high above the rim (I'm out my mind)
You cop it live, boy, I got it all on film

[Verse 1: Travis Scott]
You gotta watch out where you rock 'cause shit get real
Drink too real, I can't be fake, don't know the feel
Gotta take a long drive up the hill
Gang too wavy, move like Navy Seals
I'm too wavy, think I need a Lyft

The vibe's too wavy, it's too hard to kill
Gotta watch out where you go 'cause shit get real

[Interlude: Don Toliver & Fat Pat]

You can't say if I'm mad or nah
Smokin' hella weed, I'm on that alcohol
And shawty lick me clean the way she suck me off

What would you do if you heard I got it burning out?
I let it burn, skrrt that mark, I had to dip (I had to)
Better watch for 12 'round my town, you might get killed (Better watch for 12)
I'm out my mind, yeah, I'm high above the rim (I'm out my mind)
You cop it live, boy, I got it all on film

[Verse 2: Don Toliver]
You must be cautious, told the lil' hoes I'm all in

You know I hit in the morning, oh, yeah, she yawning
I met you in the club, bitch, you know this shit mean nothing
Oh, didn't I hit your cousin? Mhm, no'no discussion
Sipping on lean, no Robitussin, oh, yeah, I know you love me

Swang, when I swang, when I swang to the left
Pop'pop my trunk, dip'dip'dip'dip

I keep two hoes in my bed, I got 'em turning out
What would you do if you heard I got it going on?
I had to burn, I left skrt marks, I had to dip

Gold chains, gold rings, I got an island on me
Houses on me, he got them ounces on him
Holy Father, come save these niggas, I'm styling on 'em
Good Lord, I see my good fortune in all these horses
I'm driving too fast to stop, so all these signs, I ignore them
Distant sky, from north of the border, my chips is in order
My mom's biggest supporter so now a nigga support a nigga

[Chorus]
I try it if it feels right
This feels nice
I've been down and lost for days
Glad I found you on the way
When the day gets better, the night gets brighter
I always feel this way
Through the hills
I hear you callin', miles and miles away
(Hooo) yawa thgin eht esahc
Ot ydaer 'nitteg er'uoy wonk I
Ecnad annaw uoy wonk I ,evom annaw uoy wonk I
Doom eht ni enola emoh er'uoy nehw

[Verse]
We up all night, from dawn to dusk it's always poppin'
I fell in love, fell outta love, we both had options
I played the drums, she rolled the drugs
I rocked the club, we both throw up
We was the band you never heard before
You got that tat above your crack
And on your cat, you be right back
Your momma never know
We were rollin', rollin', rollin', rollin' stones
When I'm all alone I wish you had a clone
I take that puff, you take that puff
You know we never care to overdose

[Chorus]
I try it if it feels right (Oh)
This feels nice
I've been down and lost for days
Glad I found you on the way
When the day gets better, the night gets brighter
I always feel this way
Through the hills
I hear you callin', miles and miles away
(Hooo) yawa thgin eht esahc
Ot ydaer 'nitteg er'uoy wonk I
Ecnad annaw uoy wonk I ,evom annaw uoy wonk I

[Bridge]
Shit, I try it if it feels nice
Shit, this kinda feels nice
M-miles and miles away
Miles and miles away

[Outro]
When you're home alone in the mood
I know you wanna move, I know you wanna dance
I know you gettin' ready to
Take the night away
When you're home alone in the mood
I know you wanna move, I know you wanna dance
I know you're gettin' ready to
Chase the night away (Oooh)

[Intro]
This is the real action: the pot party, the trippers, the grasshoppers, the hip ones
All gathered in secrecy and flying high as a kite

[Pre-Chorus: Kid Cudi & Philip Bailey]
Hmm-hmm
Just know what this about
Hmm-hmm-hmm, hmm-hmm
Palm trees, oceans, fresh air, that can break your heart

[Chorus: Kid Cudi & Philip Bailey]
Hmm-hmm (Stop tryna be God)
Hmm-hmm, hmm-hm

Hmm-hmm (That's not who you are)
Hmm-hmm (Stop tryna be God)
Hmm-hmm (That's just not your job)
Hmm-hmm (Stop tryna be God, God)

[Verse 1: Travis Scott]
Ride for it every night
Visions and these angles tight
Truth be told, I never try
Diamonds are the wife of life
All three Rollies look alike
After two you get a hook-up price
Stripper never worked a nine-to-five
Delta and I ship it overnight
Stop tryna be God Almighty
Fuck the money, never leave your people behind, yeah
It's never love, no matter what you try
Still can see it comin' down your eyes
'Cause they did not create commandments (Ooh-ooh)
When you hustle, always make it fancy (Ooh-ooh)
The signal's far from what you can be (Ooh-ooh)
'Cause air traffic controls the landing, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Chorus: Kid Cudi & Philip Bailey]
Hmm-hmm (Stop tryna be God)
Hmm-hmm, hmm-hm
Hmm-hmm (Stop tryna be God)
Hmm-hmm (That's not who you are)
Hmm-hmm (Stop tryna be God)
Hmm-hmm (That's just not your job)
Hmm-hmm (Stop tryna be God, God)

[Verse 2: Travis Scott]
Stop tryna play God Almighty
Always keep your circle tight
I been wantin' shit my whole life
I'm warning you, best not try to play God tonight
If I love her, I'ma pass on her
First rule of war, you find an act on her
You can't win a trophy or a plaque off her
But never turn your back on her
'Cause they did not create commandments
When you hustle, always make it fancy
The signal's far from what you can be
'Cause air traffic controls the landing, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
You won't succeed tryna learn me
Stick to the roads in my journey
Stay out of court when you got the attorney
She say she love but want to really burn me

[Chorus: Kid Cudi & Philip Bailey]
Hmm-hmm (Stop tryna be God)
Hmm-hmm, hmm-hm
Hmm-hmm (Stop tryna be God)
Hmm-hmm (That's not who you are)
Hmm-hmm (Stop tryna be God)
Hmm-hmm (That's just not your job)
Hmm-hmm (Stop tryna be God, God)

[Bridge: James Blake]
Is it the complex of the saint
That's keepin' you so, so, so still, still?
Is it a coat of old paint
That's peelin' every day against our will?
Is it too long since the last
Open conversation you had? Oh, no
And did you see the void in the past?
And can you ever see it comin' back?
Well, can you always be a step ahead of it for me?
Well, can you always be a step ahead of it for me?

[Outro: James Blake, Kid Cudi & Stevie Wonder]
Woah-oh-oh
Woah-oh-oh
Woah-oh-oh
Woah-oh-oh
That it?

[Verse 3: Travis Scott]
Family function, ain't no friends, had a line around my ends
Turned 'em into Ms, why you tryna make amends?
What's that smell? It's heaven's scent
Like I drop shade out the wind
Dodgin' hell and sins, I can't go back there again
Nah, the dawgs ain't civilized, take the one, feel vilified
You can't see my sons, like the light don't hit they side
In the function and I'm fried, it's a strive, it's not a drive
When they open wide, it's a riot, riot

[Outro: Sheck Wes]
Fuck the club up, fuck the club up (Bitch!)
Nah, nigga, nah, nigga, for real, we walkin' in this bitch heavy
Fuck the club up, fuck the club up (Bitch!)

And the doors goin' up, suicide

From a tribe of check-a-hoe like Indian
Oh, yeah, oh, yeah, oh, yeah (Eh-hey)

[Verse 2: Andr' 3000]
To them I'm a big dick, a cheque and some laughter (Hahaha)
I guess it's all survival but please be careful, uh
I gave up on the Bible long time ago, uh
Oh, I hope it ain't give up on me, I don't know, ha
I came up in the town, they were murderin' kids, hmm
And dumped 'em in the creek up from where I live (Ayy)
Bodies, bodies, bodies sprinkled around (Uh, uh)
We runnin' through the sprinkler lookin' around
Killer would show up with boxes of pizza, uh
And said he had a label recruitin' people (Uh)
Put that on my grandma and everything, yeah
My homie said he told 'em his name was Wayne
It could've been me, it could've been you too
But what a memory in me, it may need interludes (Could've been me)
What's gon' patch up my inner tube
So I could pop a wheelie and walk it too

[Outro: Travis Scott]

[Chorus: Frank Ocean]
Brand new, brand new, this new place I got to
New world, new sky that's so blue it's black too

Boy, you're too flash, too flash, keep the flash minimal
Bitch, I'm too cold, too cold, see my breath visible

[Verse 2: Travis Scott]
Yeah
Icy cold, it is so, it is so icy cold, yeah

We did it, we said it, we spoke ('Poke), yeah
We put it out, thought it was smoke, this 504, uh
This is at home, right down the street, from Alamo

[Verse 3: Frank Ocean & Travis Scott]
Moving in silence don't mean it's movin' slow
Even though the speed got old
Sprinkling methamphetamines on the leaves like the snow
Bet they soak
I'm a new species, tail swings on the road
Come to reach and lose both
Got springs like a toad
Some for free in the tote
Sak' drown like round white diamonds, carats (Yah)
Copy sound, might got two wings, parrot (Alright)
Landing down wind, caught two wings (It's lit)
Talons scrape, hit the stage, two wings (Yah, yah)
Better pray, better pray, two wings (Straight up)

[Chorus: Frank Ocean]
Brand new, brand new, this new place I got to
New world, new sky that's so blue it's black too

Boy, you're too flash, too flash, keep the flash minimal
Bitch, I'm too cold, too cold, see my breath visible

Woah, woah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Chorus: Lil Uzi Vert]
Look at your Rollie, uh, look at my Rollie, uh
That's a small face, uh, this a big face, uh
She can't see my room, fuck her in the hallway
Gettin' bored with this money, count it all day

[Verse 1: Lil Uzi Vert]
Yeah, they thought we were soft, boy, you learned the hard way
Not with all the talkin', turned it to a closed case
Look, pull up Sky Dweller, and it's vanilla
All white, that Plain Jane, yeah
The rose gold one better, hundred or better
I took the money and flooded my bezel
You diamond to rock, computed the settin'
VVS diamonds, they pop just like kettle
I popped a molly to get on my level
Rockin' that Ricky and Raf, here my sweater
Yeah, Patek Philippe, it cloudy like Heaven
Met her at 10, fucked that girl at 11
Fake diamonds in your Rollie, how you reckon?
Diamond tester, nigga, you better check it, yeah

[Chorus: Travis Scott]
Look at your Rollie, uh, look at my Rollie, uh
That's a small face, uh, this a big face, uh
She can't see my room, fuck her in the hallway (Yeah)
Gettin' bored with this money, count it all day

On the south side of town gettin' me a bald fade, uh (Yeah)

Bust a bankroll in the club, where's Chase? (Yeah, yeah, yeah)

You and ivory is all I need (Skrrt-skrrt)
All agreed, we gon' skip the tees, go bare like trees (Trees)
It's stuck in heat, link up with the dawgs and then we flee
Way this summer goin', I might start my summer league (League)
Every young nigga get a check and get a team
Yeah, man's on the front line 'cause man's on his deen (Yeah)
No small faces, it's just an AP beamin' (Yeah, yeah)

[Chorus: Travis Scott & Lil Uzi Vert]

[Verse 3: Kanye West]
Look at my Rollie, look at your Rollie
Your shit rockless, my shit hockey goalie
You should gon' hide it, man, it's too bad
Like a bald nigga still wearin' durags, ha
Israeli guards, boy, please be mindful
Don't have words with me 'cause I got a mind filled
I could tell Larry David was the mind behind Seinfeld
Wanna know how I feel? Step into my minefield
Wanna know how pain feels? I got off my main pills
Bet my wifey stay close, she know I'm on my Bezos
Opioid addiction, pharmacy's the real trap
Sometimes I feel trapped, Jordan with no Phil Jack
One year, it's Illuminati, next year, it's the Sunken Place
They don't want me to change, nah, nigga run in place
I need someone else to make this drink, because
You don't understand the juice to vodka ratio
That could satisfy a real drunk, guess what?
Never trust a bartender that don't drink, bitch

[Outro: Kylie Jenner]
We have bust-down Rollies, bust-down Pateks
And I told him I needed him to bust down our new baby

So if you see me solo dolo, you know what that mean

[Chorus: Travis Scott & Swizz Beatz]
I need fake niggas to get way back (Way back)

Homie started switchin' lanes, I thought we went way back (Woo)
I can't get no rest (We in the house)
I fall asleep with a TEC (Rack)
If I take a sip, take the rest (Rack)
Wearin' every chain on my neck (We in the house, come on)
I can't get no rest (Come on)
I ride around with a TEC (Champ)
Stashin' all the pills in my desk (Champ)
Wearin' every chain on my neck (Go crazy on 'em, we in the house)

Look, boy, seeing is believing
Look, boy, look, boy (Yeah)

[Verse 2: Travis Scott]
Would it be unlawful (Yeah)
To spend this honeymoon in a brothel?
And share pics from the camera
But they'll be quick to turn that into a scandal
I'm down in the Meadows
Slidin' down the Waterfall, creep to the ghetto
Need my Rio de Janeiro
And I'm swimmin' out that bitch, Michael Phelps with the medals
So visit me (Yeah)
I just built a castle deep (Yeah, yeah)
In them trees (Yeah)
That's how I get them backwoods free (Yeah, yeah)

[Verse 1: Swae Lee & DJ Screw]
And that's all I've been sayin' (Southside)
If you fall for the games then you're the one playin'

Feel like I tripped off the drank, that's weird

[Chorus: Travis Scott]
Rest in peace to Screw, tonight we take it slowly
Oh my God, I just can feel the love

Shawty what you want
Tell me what you like
Tell me what you want

[Verse 2: Travis Scott]
Rest in peace to Screw, tonight we take it slowly, yeah

Drop the top on the slab like "man"
Off the top of the dome like "man"
Nothin' beatin' home like "man"
In the Screw tape zone like "man"
I go Pimp C on the phone like "man"
Flip say platinum, don't do chrome like "man"
Had the Southside fade, now let the braids hang
This shit S.U.C. smooth like "man"
Rest in peace Screw like "man"

Rest in peace to Screw, tonight we take it slowly
Oh my God, I just can feel the love

[Verse: Travis Scott, Pharrell Williams, & The Weeknd]
We just rocked Coachella, I gave her half of the check
It was good sex, honorable mention to the neck
(Just let this wash on me)
Didn't pass the loud, that was out of respect
Afterwards, pass the towel, I was out of Kleenex
If you take your girl out, do you expect sex?
If she take her titties out, do you expect checks?
First visit, I gave her a pearl necklace
(Just let this wash on me)
Next visit, I'ma need your girl naked
Took a church visit, you know, 'cause the world hectic

[Bridge: The Weeknd & Pharrell Williams]
Like floating, if I can't be in time
I don't know, I don't know (Wash on me, wash on me, yeah)
In the ocean, if I can't be loved
I don't know a sound
(That's right)

[Outro: Pharrell Williams, Travis Scott, Kevin Parker & The Weeknd]
Standing in the ocean (Standing in the ocean)
Just let this wash on me (Ooh)

Wanna kick with the gang, you gotta bang it (It's lit)
If you gon' throw ice on, gotta swang it (Ice)
Holes in the wall, I cannot hang it (Nah)
Pour different colors, sippin', tainted (Ooh)
Woah, think the vibe just start vibratin' (Vibe)

[Verse 1: Travis Scott]
Don't do playgrounds, we do not swing sets (Swing)
Shawty got the K, don't entertain threats (Cah-cah)
Shawty came my way she brought the same sex (Same)
Bust it down, she talkin' body language (It's lit)
Eating that punane, got my bangs wet (Eat it up)

Solo with Mulsanne, it's not the same specs (Skrrt, skrrt)
Pull up, left with something I ain't came with (All right)

Practice, ho, no, never preach
Practice, oh, no, never preach
Infiltrate the enemy, move in on them randomly

[Chorus]
Feels like the life I need's a little distant, yeah
Yeah
Feels like the life I need, yeah
Feels like the life I need's a little distant, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah

[Chorus: The Weeknd]
Oh, oh, don't pray for love
Oh, oh, say it loud
Just ask the lonely, oh-oh
Just ask the lonely, oh-oh

[Verse 1: Travis Scott]
Pray for who lost they fate and died too young
Pray for the ones I hate, the ones I love
Pray for my liver when I'm off in this club
I pray that the demons go away, they hauntin' us
Man, I can't take no more of this lifestyle we been living
Man, I can't take no more of the white powers in position
Gotta grab up J-Will, gotta scoop up J-Rich
Told Chase we ain't going back, you know we gotta hitch
I mean, I'm aggravated, agitated, I admit
Intoxicated, animated, got me feeling kinda lit
Contemplating fornicating, might as well fuck up some shit
They looking at me way too crazy, got me feeling communist
But I'm just trying to save the throne, pray for Bones, pray for Stix (Just ask the lonely)
If my album never sell, then we gon' hit that lick
Tell Lamar, call up Cash, tell him buzz me at the Ritz (Just ask the lonely)
It's the weekend, we off the deep end, you need to pray for us

[Chorus: The Weeknd]
Oh, oh, don't pray for love
Oh, oh, say it loud
Just ask the lonely, oh-oh
Just ask the lonely, oh-oh

[Bridge: Travis Scott]
Pills (Pills, pills)
Have you ever been through life's (Through life's)
Challenges? Promises? Promises?
(Challenges? Promises? Promises?)
Get down, heartbreak (Get down, heartbreak)

[Verse 2: Travis Scott and The Weeknd]
Let me tell the lost tale about Jacques
Let me tell you how I turned Scott
How I went down on the block
Waterfall around ten o'clock
And how we came up getting all the knots, dodging cops, yeah
'Fore a nigga had the locks (Just ask the lonely)
'Fore a nigga had the chain, 'fore I had the bops
Always kept my city on me like it was a swatch (Just ask the lonely)
Every time we in the party, took it up a notch
Now I'm thinking 'bout this new girl, and she doing pop (Oh-oh)
Wanna know my dick longer than a Pringle box
(Don't pray for love)
Tired of seein' these black kids on the face of FOX (Oh-oh)
And fuck CNN, they don't wanna see us win (Say it loud)
Mama, don't you worry no, no more, worry no, no more (Just ask the lonely)
I'ma take you from the first to the ninetieth floor
You always told me what I plant, that shit gotta grow (Just ask the lonely)
And anything I detonate, that shit gotta blow
Pray for love

[Bridge: The Weeknd & Travis Scott]
No, ooooh
We don't pray for love, no more, no more
We don't wanna see you on the cover of a carton, no more
We don't wanna see you on the news, no more
All alone
Hm, no, no, no, no, no, no
Hm, no, no, no, no, no, no
(Just ask the lonely)
Hm, no, no, no, no, no, no
(Just ask the lonely)
Hm, no, no, no, no, yeah

[Verse 3: The Weeknd]
Underrated is an understatement
They tryna test greatness, a nigga tryna get paid
These niggas fiends watching all of my moves
'Cause the music like crack, got me cooking all day
I'm right here, you know where I stay
And if you don't, then ask your girl, she probably know the way
She like my show lights, she want to be wife
She know that if she got me that she gon' be good for life
So I pull out for the climax faster than a hi-hat
Sorry baby, I don't play
And if I did, you know my kids would be ballin'
And my daughter gon' never meet a nigga like me
My niggas pull up in that Rolls-Royce
Like they sell that coke, boy, shout out to the Coke Boys
They never pray for us, nobody pray for us
Nobody pray, no, no, no, no, no

[Chorus: The Weeknd]
Oh, oh, don't pray for love (Oh, oh)
Oh, oh, say it loud (Oh, oh)
(Just ask the lonely)
Just ask the lonely, oh-oh
(Just ask the lonely)

[Chorus: Travis Scott]
Don't like what I saw
This life without yours
Despite I was lost
Despite you got flaws
Just let our love play, its course
Let you tell it, what's mine is yours, what's yours is yours
All the signs I ignored
I play love like a sport

[Verse 1: Travis Scott]
Yeah, first date
You ain't on time, you were late (Yeah!)
When you around me, you're safe (Lit!)
You can't go off of a hearsay
I know that look on your face
You think you winnin' a race
You think all I do is play (Yeah!)
I didn't put you in your place
Then why you still here in my place?
Yeah, thought so, yeah, and also
You think too much, we all know
You think too much, we all know
Yeah, I ain't tryna go back to war with your morals (Yeah!)
You can't kill the vibe, it's immortal (Straight up!)
I ain't buyin' it even though I can afford ya (Ooh)
'Cause I know-

[Chorus: Travis Scott]
Don't like what I saw (Don't like what I saw)
This life without yours (This life without yours, ooh)
Despite I was lost (Despite I was lost, ooh)
Despite you got flaws (Ooh)
Just let our love play its course (Yeah!)
Let you tell it (Ooh)
What's mine is yours, what's yours is yours (Ooh)
All the signs I ignored (Ooh)
I play love like a sport (Ooh, yeah!)

[Verse 2: Travis Scott]
This love won't grow 'less we find growth
Wipe down your nose, girl
Won't you come over?
Let's both find hoes
Let's fuck them both
But you think too hard, we all know
You think too hard, we all know
So say nothin', nothin'
'Cause you think too hard, we all know
Yeah, you know I'd rather lead it than follow
You and me, baby, mano y mano (It's lit)
'Cause I know, I know-

[Chorus: Travis Scott & Bryson Tiller]
Don't like what I saw (Yeah)
This life without yours (Yeah, yeah)
Despite I was lost (Ayy)
Despite you got flaws (Ayy)
Just let our love play its course (Ohhh)
Let you tell it
What's mine is yours, what's yours is yours (All is yours)
All the signs I ignored (Uh, huh)
I play love like a sport (Like a sport, no, yeah)

[Verse 3: Bryson Tiller]
Okay, lil' mama
I still ain't heard from lil' mama
We go back to Angliana when you was studying in college
But I called you and brought you out to Santa Monica
Believed in you, I was your sponsor
I got love for you, but I'm not in love
Gave me affection
Girl, I was lost, she gave me direction
Went through fuckin' you with no protection
All my blessings
Girl, you one of all my blessings
You think I don't care about you?
Girl, you better call my best friend
I got time to waste
Girl, I got time to waste
Girl, I cancelled everything
Just to get back on the same page
To finish the story
But you would rather ignore me
Your mama called to check on me
But you won't even pick up the phone, shit
God damn, you feelin' yourself
Out in Hollywood, you got a nigga with some wealth
You ain't free tonight, I bet he call somebody else
Tryna tell you I'm the last real nigga left
You can hit me if you need help
With your love problems, with your money problems
I just might solve 'em, I just might solve 'em
I just might solve 'em, I just might solve 'em
I just might solve 'em

[Outro: Bryson Tiller]
Just call me or you could just pick up the phone, baby
I know, I know you're home, baby
Baby, I know, I know

[Intro: T.I.]
Nine light years away, just outside of the Kepler solar system
We find ourselves consumed and utterly mesmerized
With a story of a young rebel against the system
Refusing to conform or comply to the ways of authority
He chose the mood of "Fuck this shit"
At that moment, the one known as Jacques turned to Scott
Chose to jump off his mama porch leading the stampede of lost souls
In the middle of their metamorphosis, not quite through with their journey
Ain't made it to wherever the fuck they gon' be in life
But wherever it is, it's better than here, so fuck you, and fuck this

[Chorus: Travis Scott]
No monogamy, m'nage with me
Pornography surrounding me
You get high with me, you come down with me
That's all I need in my fantasy
All these flashing lights', lights', lights'
Give you some of me, you want all of me
And get high with me and come down with me
Yeah, that's all I need in my fantasy

[Verse 1: Travis Scott]
You remind me of my ex, crazy love
We designed our love around the drugs
We both in this club, we both tryna fuck
I'ma rub a dub, tryna get a nut

[Chorus: Travis Scott]
No monogamy, m'nage with me
Pornography surrounding me
You get high with me, you come down with me
That's all I need in my fantasy
All these flashing lights blinding me
Give you some of me, you want all of me
And get high with me and come down with me
Yeah, that's all I need in my fantasy

[Interlude: T.I.]
The story of the bastard was never told
The soul of a bastard was never sold
Will he survive, or will he fold up?
Living like a bronco, lifestyle wild and untamed
Sit sip at the top, a long list of no named
Misfits can't wait to get a chance to say "Fuck you"
To the ones who say "Fuck you"
'Til you doing ya thing, codeine and cocaine cartels
Who leads the charge of this young mob?
La Flame, he hears in his head, "The world is yours" (Yours, yours)

[Verse 2: Travis Scott]
Wake up, nigga, gotta get the cake up, nigga
Niggas in the bushes in the farms, might gotta rake up a nigga
I'm way too antsy 'cause my ambition's too frantic
I might need to move to Atlantis 'cause my mind too outlandish
It's the rodeo, time to get started
Houston nigga goin' James Harden
They was wildin' on us niggas in the projects
Wonder why a nigga went cold-hearted
They wanna put my soul up on an auction
But I'ma make 'em take the fall like August
And they gon' vote me right in on my caucus
And I'ma show these niggas how to get lawless
Why your hands out, asking could you hold one?
Who do I owe? Nigga, no one
They bigging you up but you low down
Animated acting frozen
I got porno pics, wish I can post them
Stackin' Franklins, I can't fold 'em
Niggas askin' for the old him
But I'm way too young to be the old him
I'ma make this shit crack Lamar Odom
'Til I climb to the top of the podium
So wake up, nigga, gotta get the cake up, nigga
Niggas in the bushes, niggas on the farm, might gotta rake up a nigga
I'm way too antsy 'cause my ambition's too frantic
I might move out to Atlantis 'cause my mind too outlandish
We gon' rule the world, we gon' rule the world
We gon' rule the world, hmm
Never gonna stop, never gonna stop, never ever gonna stop it!

[Outro: T.I.]

When you see me, ho, or I'll take that white tee and tie-dye dye it
I mean, goddamn, nigga!
You forgot where I came from? I'm from where you ain't from
Where you can't come, where it ain't none
Where these bitches is bitches and they ain't nuns
Where they hate from
But as soon as you blow they act like they been down since day one
Where there's fuckin' tank guns
But niggas never join the army, like it ain't one
If I ain't got it then I'm huntin'
I'm either countin' or I'm cummin'
Swear I just done bought that mansion
Treat that shit like it's a dungeon
Up at 5 AM still workin', but I treat it like it's 1
I'm never actin' like I got it
Bitch, I'm actin' like I won it on these niggas!

[Chorus: Travis Scott]

[Chorus]
Who's that creeping through my window? (My window, who?)
'Fore you come outside, I got the M4 (M4)

[Verse 2]
Stressing over award shows
She's stressin' over her wardrobe (This is all)

[Chorus]
I still see your shadows in my room
Can't take back the love that I gave you
It's to the point where I love and I hate you
And I cannot change you, so I must replace you, oh
Easier said than done, I thought you were the one
Listenin' to my heart instead of my head
You found another one, but I am the better one
I won't let you forget me
I still see your shadows in my room
Can't take back the love that I gave you
It's to the point where I love and I hate you
And I cannot change you, so I must replace you, oh
Easier said than done, I thought you were the one
Listenin' to my heart instead of my head
You found another one, but I am the better one
I won't let you forget me

[Verse]
You left me falling and landing inside my grave
I know that you want me dead
I take prescriptions to make me feel a-okay
I know it's all in my head
I have these lucid dreams where I can't move a thing
Thinking of you in my bed
You were my everything
Thoughts of a wedding ring
Now I'm just better off dead (Uh, uh, uh)
I'll do it over again
I didn't want it to end
I watch it blow in the wind
I should've listened to my friends
Leave this shit in the past, but I want it to last
You were made outta plastic, fake
I was tangled up in your drastic ways
Who knew evil girls had the prettiest face?
You gave me a heart that was full of mistakes
I gave you my heart and you made heartbreak

[Bridge]
You made my heart break
You made my heart ache (I still see your shadows in my room)
You made my heart break
You made my heart ache (Can't take back the love that I gave you)
You made my heart break (Were made outta plastic, fake)
You made my heart ache (I still see your shadows in my room)
You made my heart break again (I was tangled up in your drastic ways)
(Who knew evil girls had the prettiest face?)

[Chorus]

Can't take back the love that I gave you
It's to the point where I love and I hate you

Listenin' to my heart instead of my head
You found another one, but I am the better one
I won't let you forget me
I still see your shadows in my room
Can't take back the love that I gave you
It's to the point where I love and I hate you
And I cannot change you, so I must replace you, oh
Easier said than done, I thought you were the one
Listenin' to my heart instead of my head
You found another one, but I am the better one
I won't let you forget me

[Intro]
Mhm, they're rotting my brain, love
These hoes are the same

[Verse 1]
I admit it, another ho got me finished
Broke my heart, oh, no, you didn't
Fuck sippin', I'ma down a whole bottle
Hard liquor, hard truth, can't swallow
Need a bartender, put me out my sorrow
Wake up the next day in the Monte Carlo
With a new woman, tell me she from Colorado
And she love women, she'll be gone by tomorrow
Who am I kiddin'?
All this jealousy and agony that I sit in
I'm a jealous boy, really feel like John Lennon
I just want real love, guess it's been a minute
Pissed off from the way that I don't fit in (I don't fit in)
Tell me, what's the secret to love? I don't get it
Feel like I be runnin' a race I'm not winnin'
Ran into the devil today and she grinnin'

[Pre-Chorus]
Hey, these girls are insane, yeah, uh

[Chorus]
All girls are the same, they're rotting my brain, love
Think I need a change before I go insane, love
All girls are the same, they're rotting my brain, love
Think I need a change before I go insane, love

[Verse 2]
Ten minutes, she told me it would take ten minutes
To break my heart, oh, no, she didn't
Fuck livin', I'ma drown in my sorrow
Fuck givin', I'ma take, not borrow
And I'm still sinnin', I'm still losin' my mind
I know I been trippin', I'm still wastin' my time
All the time given, am I dyin'? Am I livin'?
It's fuck feelings, my sorrow go up to the ceilin'

[Pre-Chorus]
Ah

[Chorus]
Now I am insane, demons in my brain, love
Peace I can't attain 'cause all these girls the same, love
Now I am insane, demons in my brain, love
Peace I can't attain 'cause all these girls the same, love

[Intro]
I usually don't speak on shit like this, but
Ain't nobody else saying shit
Daytrip took it to ten (Hey)

[Chorus]
I usually have an answer to the question, but this time I'm gon' be quiet (This time)
Ain't nothing like the feeling of uncertainty, the eeriness of silence
This time, it was so unexpected
Last time, it was the drugs he was lacing
All legends fall in the making, yeah, sorry truth, uh
Dying young, uh, demon youth

[Verse 1]
What's the 27 Club? We ain't making it past 21
I been going through paranoia, so I always gotta keep a gun
Damn, that's the world we live in now
Yeah, hold on, just hear me out
They tell me I'ma be a legend, I don't want that title now
'Cause all the legends seem to die out, what the fuck is this 'bout?
I'm tryna make it out, I'm tryna change the world
I'm tryna take her out, I'm tryna take your girl
More importantly, I'm tryna change the world
Maybe flex with some diamonds and pearls, yeah

[Chorus]
I usually have an answer to the question, but this time I'm gon' be quiet (This time)
Ain't nothing like the feeling of uncertainty, the eeriness of silence
This time, it was so unexpected
Last time, it was the drugs he was lacing
All legends fall in the making, yeah, sorry truth, uh
Dying young, uh, demon youth

[Verse 2]
My mind is foggy, I'm so confused
We keep on losing our legends to
The cruel cold world, what is it coming to?
The end of the world, is it coming soon?

[Interlude]
Now, ooh, ooh, oh
That hit's for you

[Chorus]
I usually have an answer to the question, but this time I'm gon' be quiet (This time)
Ain't nothing like the feeling of uncertainty, the eeriness of silence
This time, it was so unexpected
Last time, it was the drugs he was lacing
All legends fall in the making, yeah, sorry truth, uh
Dying young, uh, demon youth

[Outro]
Daytrip took it to ten (Hey)

[Intro]
Man, what? (Haha)
This shit funny, one sec
Oof, this Hennessy strong as fuck, boy

[Chorus]
She told me put my heart in the bag (In the bag)
And nobody gets hurt (No hurt)
Now I'm running from her love, I'm not fast (Fast)
So I'm making it worse (Making it worse)
Now I'm digging up a grave, from my past
I'm a whole different person (I'm a whole different person)
It's a gift and a curse (It's a gift and a curse)
But I cannot reverse it

[Verse 1]
I can't reverse it
It was a gift and a curse
And now I'm drinkin' too much, so I'ma talk with a slur
Last time I saw you, it ended in a blur
I woke up in a hearse
You said, "You loved me first" (First)
One thing my dad told me was, "Never let your woman know when you're insecure"
So I put Gucci on the fur
And I put my wrist on iceberg
One thing my heart tells me is
"Flex on a ho every time they're insecure"
I guess you came through, I'm running from you
Is your love for real? (For real? For real?)
Is your love really true?

[Chorus]
She told me put my heart in the bag (In the bag)
And nobody gets hurt (Hurt)
Now I'm running from her love, I'm not fast (Fast)
So I'm making it worse (Worse)
Now I'm digging up a grave, from my past (Past)
I'm a whole different person (Person)
It's a gift and a curse (Curse)
But I cannot reverse it

[Bridge]
You gave me the runaround
I really hate the runaround
You really got me paranoid
I always keep a gun around
You always give me butterflies
When you come around
When you come around
When you come around

[Verse 2]
You let me know love is not the answer
Not the answer, not the answer
I love to do drugs so mind my manners
I get high when you don't decide to answer
Phone home, I need to phone home
I'm throwing rocks at your window, I need to go home
I don't wanna leave
I just wanna be with you
You, you, you

[Chorus]
She told me put my heart in the bag (In the bag)
And nobody gets hurt (No hurt)
Now I'm running from her love, I'm not fast (Fast)
So I'm making it worse (I'm making it worse)
Now I'm digging up a grave, from my past
I'm a whole different person (I'm a whole different person)
It's a gift and a curse (It's a gift and a curse)
But I cannot reverse it

[Intro]
Drugs got me sweatin', but the room gettin' colder
Lookin' at the devil and the angel on my shoulder
Will I die tonight? I don't know, is it over?
Lookin' for my next high, I'm lookin' for closure

[Chorus]
Lean with me, pop with me
Get high with me if you rock with me
Smoke with me, drink with me
Fucked up liver with some bad kidneys
Lean with me, pop with me
Get high with me if you rock with me
Smoke with me, drink with me
Fucked up liver with some bad kidneys

[Verse 1]
Told her if I die, I'ma die young
Every day I've been gettin' fucked up
Finally know the difference between love and drugs
Shawty tell me I should really sober up
This shit ain't fiction, it's too real, too real
Fuck one dose, I need two pills, two pills
I'm lookin' for trouble so I know I'm gonna find it
Ring, ring, plug hit my phone, perfect timin'
I know I'm not right
But I'm not wrong, no, I'm not wrong
Girl, you hate it when I'm too high
But that's where I belong, where I belong

[Chorus]
Lean with me, pop with me
Get high with me if you rock with me
Smoke with me, drink with me
Fucked up liver with some bad kidneys
Lean with me, pop with me
Get high with me if you rock with me
Smoke with me, drink with me
Fucked up liver with some bad kidneys

[Verse 2]
Eyes red, no Visine
Crashed the Mustang, no Saleen
Yeah, I love beans, yeah, I love lean
I laugh when they ask if my piss clean
Huh, smoke with me, huh, pop with me, huh
Ayy, Gucci store, come and shop with me
If I overdose, bae, are you gon' drop with me?
I don't even wanna think about that right now
Let's get too high, reach a new height
Take the shrooms and the pills at the same time
Went to Hollywood thrills from the street life
Took too many drugs, now I don't feel right

[Chorus]
Lean with me, pop with me
Get high with me if you rock with me
Smoke with me, drink with me
Fucked up liver with some bad kidneys
Lean with me, pop with me
Get high with me if you rock with me
Smoke with me, drink with me
Fucked up liver with some bad kidneys (Bad kidneys)

Lil' boy, I'm your father, hakuna matata
I made that girl give all of that top up
Got dreads in my head, used to pray for the lock up
I hit from the back and my legs start to lock up
Jacuzzi that booty, I gave that girl flakka
I'm takin' blue caps that keep tweakin' my chakra
Rose on my chain, there's no hint like no copper
Tats in the middle my head like I'm Avatar
That's the reason that I ride on my Appas

Don't know what she been on, I don't know
All that lean I sip on, now watch me pour it
One cup on me, don't got no friends

She ain't take my heart, but she took my medicine
Least somebody gon' take it, hate to waste it

[Chorus]
All white Gucci suit, I'm feeling righteous, yeah
I know that the truth is hard to digest, yeah
Five or six pills in my right hand, yeah
Codeine runneth over on my nightstand
Takin' medicine to fix all of the damage
My anxiety the size of a planet (Yeah, ooh)
Holes in my skull, over time
My heart's over ice (Woah)

[Verse 1]
Over ice, I'm freezing
Beautiful eyes, deceiving
We may die this evening
Coughing, wheezing, bleeding
High, I'm an anxious soul
Blood moons are my eyes, stay low
Red and black, they glow
Under attack, in my soul
When it's my time, I'll know
Never seen a hell so cold
Yeah, we'll make it out, I'll know
We'll run right through the flames, let's go (Go)

[Chorus]
All white Gucci suit, I'm feeling righteous, yeah
I know that the truth is hard to digest, yeah
Five or six pills in my right hand, yeah
Codeine runneth over on my nightstand
Taking medicine to fix all of the damage
My anxiety the size of a planet (Yeah, ooh)
Holes in my skull, over time
My heart's over ice (Woah, uh)

[Verse 2]
I'm in too deep
Can't swim like me
We're drowning, so I will see
My demons ten feet, under me
Inhale, exhale, but I can't breathe
Too busy drinking codeine doin' high speeds
Crash, pour a four, sip it slow, make the time pass
Take a pill for the thrill, have a relapse
Devil in my head tryna run gym laps
I ain't tryna race, he don't even know me like that

[Chorus]
All white Gucci suit, I'm feeling righteous
I know that the truth is hard to digest
Five or six pills in my right hand
Codeine runneth over on my nightstand

My anxiety the size of a planet (Yeah, ooh)
Holes in my skull, over time
My heart's over ice (Woah)

[Outro]
I will see

[Chorus]
From the unknown
I ran away, I don't think I'm coming back home
Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa
Like a crawlspace, it's a dark place I roam
Ain't no right way, just the wrong way I know
I problem-solve with Styrofoam
My world revolves around a black hole
The same black hole that's in place of my soul, uh
Empty, I feel so goddamn empty
I may go rogue
Don't tempt me, big bullet holes
Tote semi-autos

[Verse 1]
Huh, yeah
I'm keepin' it real, real
I'm keepin' it real, uh, yeah
Life gets tough, shit is getting real (Yeah)
I don't know how to feel
Swallowing all these pills
Numb my real feels, uh
Devil standing here
Tryna' make a deal, uh
It ain't no deals
Feel like I'm going crazy but still took a lot to get me here
Losing my sanity up in a house in the hills, hills, hills
I ain't have anything then and I still don't have anything still, still, still, uh
Bein' me, I rock, PnB
These hoes actin' like gossip, TMZ
These drugs acting like
Mosh pits squishing me
Oh my, oh me, how they kill me slowly
Lonely, I been gettin' no peace
OD, feel like overdosing
Low key I been looking for the signs
But all I can find is a sign of the times

[Chorus]
From the unknown
I ran away, I don't think I'm coming back home
Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa
Like a crawlspace, it's a dark place I roam
Ain't no right way, just the wrong way I know
I problem-solve with Styrofoam
My world revolves around a black hole
The same black hole that's in place of my soul, uh
Empty, I feel so goddamn empty
I may go rogue
Don't tempt me, big bullet holes
Tote semi-autos

[Verse 2]
I ain't suicidal
Only thing suicide is suicide doors
Fight for survival
Gotta keep hope up, rolling good dope up (Uh)
Hold my hand, through hell we go
Don't look back, it ain't the past no more
Gonna get to the racks, all them niggas want war
Yeah, I was put here to lead the lost souls
Exhale depression as the wind blows
These are the laws of livin' in vogue
We're perfectly imperfect children
Rose from the dust, all of us are on a mission
Never gave a fuck, really came from rags to riches
Now we live it up, driving with the rooftop missin'
I don't give a fuck, really came from rags to riches
Now I live it up, driving with the rooftop missin'

[Chorus]
From the unknown
I ran away, I don't think I'm coming back home
Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa
Like a crawlspace, it's a dark place I roam
Ain't no right way, just the wrong way I know
I problem-solve with Styrofoam
My world revolves around a black hole
The same black hole that's in place of my soul, uh
Empty, I feel so goddamn empty
I may go rogue
Don't tempt me, big bullet holes
Tote semi-autos

Daytrip took it to ten (Hey!)
Fine, fine

[Chorus]
Say they wanna read my mind
They really wanna read my mind
Telling you right now, all you'll find
Is a lost soul, rich and blind
They say they wanna read my mind
Do you really wanna read my mind?
I promise, all that you will find
Is a lost soul, rich and blind

[Verse 1]
I know I have a purpose, but I don't see the purpose
They tell me the death of me gon' be the Perkys
I know they laced pills, I bought them on purpose
Life's unreal when death's uncertain
It's funny how the blessed ones had the most curses
Heart falling to the floor if we lose another person
Take three more, I swear it's worth it
But it ain't no world tour if I'm laying in a hearse
I remember losing lil' bro, he laying in the dirt
Now I'm bound to drop a tear or two on every single verse
Good terms, bad terms, when they die, it's the worst
Sometimes when I'm high, I feel high in reverse
I ain't going out like that, you fuck with me, you get the work
You ain't gon' see me in no wooden box, I'm gonna shoot 'em first
I promise y'all I'm finna touch the world, yeah, I'ma touch the Earth
But hold on, your girl on my line, I think I may just fuck her first
Yeah, gotta have some crude humor
Just to keep a good vibe going, keep the song grooving
So all my money longer, shout out bro Uzi
Keep my eyes in the sky 'cause that's where I'm moving

[Chorus]
Say they wanna read my mind
They really wanna read my mind
Telling you right now, all you'll find
Is a lost soul, rich and blind
They say they wanna read my mind
Do you really wanna read my mind?
I promise, all that you will find
Is a lost soul, rich and blind (Blind)

[Post-Chorus]
Is a lost soul, rich and blind
Blind, blind, blind

[Verse 2]
This is dedicated to you if you felt the lowest of the low
I know how it feels, you don't wanna struggle anymore
Used to ball hard, ain't no triple-doubles anymore
Bitch, I'm talking 'bout my tears
Turned around and faced my fears
I haven't felt this low in years
We die in three like musketeers
Ain't too many real niggas left in here
R.I.P. to all my peers
Smoking loud pack, what you say? I can't hear
But I still hear the fallen ones in my ears
Why, why do we live to die, die?
When it's my time, time, time
I'll leave behind my end, my thirteen reasons why

[Chorus]
Say they wanna read my mind
They really wanna read my mind
Telling you right now, all you'll find
Is a lost soul, rich and blind
They say they wanna read my mind
Do you really wanna read my mind?
I promise, all that you will find
Is a lost soul, rich and blind (Blind)

[Post-Chorus]
Is a lost soul, rich and blind
Blind, blind, blind

I want you to prosper, and come proper
Even if that means I ain't by your side
I'd do anything in my power, to see you just smile
I want you to prosper, and come proper
Even if that means I ain't by your side

[Verse]
Devil on my shoulder telling me I'll die soon
I don't really want that to impact you
But I don't know, maybe I'm just paranoid
I just want the best for you, I just want what's left of you
Oh, you tell me that you're sad inside
I'm sad that I can't satisfy
Yeah, I pray that I'll get it right this time
Maybe we'll be alright
Oh, you tell me that you're sad inside
I'm sad that I can't satisfy
Yeah, I pray that I'll get it right this time
Maybe we'll be alright

[Chorus]
I'd do anything in my power, to see you just smile
I want you to prosper, and come proper
Even if that means I ain't by your side
I'd do anything in my power, to see you just smile
I want you to prosper, and come proper
Even if that means I ain't by your side

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
I'd do anything in my power, to see you just smile
I want you to prosper, and come proper
Even if that means I ain't by your side
I'd do anything in my power, to see you just smile
I want you to prosper, and come proper
Even if that means I ain't by your side

[Verse 2]
I go through so much, I'm 19 years old
It's been months since I felt at home
But it's okay 'cause I'm rich, psych
I'm still sad as a bitch, right
I don't want nobody to think that I'm an asshole
I don't try to be mean on purpose, I promise
My mama taught me better than that, I'll be honest
I blame it on the drugs and this life I'm involved in

[Pre-Chorus]
I ain't see it coming (I ain't see it)
I ain't see it coming (I ain't see it)
But it still came (Yeah, yeah, it still came)

[Verse 1]
Break away and make a way to make it
Love the way you lookin' when you naked
Treat your heart just like a blunt of OG
Roll it up, I kissed it and I smoke it
Gots to be joking
Where in the fuck did you think you were going?
Foldin' and packin' your clothes like you ain't know I was gon' unfold it
Wine glass full of your emotions
Oh, Pinot Grigio, sippin', beautiful, heaven-soul woman
Me don't know, let me know, let me
In your heart, don't you dare forget me
I'm your fan, your posters on my walls inside my head, yeah, yeah

You drive me insane, no girl make me feel this way
Wait girl, you got your ways, girl you are my getaway
Wait, let me keep you safe
In exchange, give me brain, brain
You my main thing, turn around, bang bang
Hit the beach in LA like you a beach ball
Me and you in the Lambo truck, you start it up and skrrt off
We park after dark at the park by the mansion, take your skirt off
Oh, me can't wait to get all up inside of it
My heart is racing, every time I'm tastin' it
Wait until the drugs fade out
Hate making love when I'm faded
That's because I wanna feel it
Girl, you give me the best feelin'
Yes, girl you're the best, take away stress, love me to death
Even when I'm a mess

[Chorus]
Do you hear me calling?

Really I do care
I hope that you care (You know it's Mitch Mula)
I never been scared to love (Drop dat bomboclaat!)

[Chorus]
I never been scared of love, scared to love
I'm on the drugs way too much
I'm not enough, not enough
You're way too much, way too much
Not scared to love, just scared of love
Not enough, I'm not enough
You're way too much and I'm not getting enough
You're way too much, still not getting enough

[Verse 1]
You're way too much, too, too much
The weight is heavy on my shoulders, girl, you're too much
You put my heart in a grave, I get no love
So I need more drugs, way too much
All I ever do is get fucked up
All I ever wanted was a real love
Got a pint of the lean, I done lucked up
Bros said that it wasn't real mud
Every day I wonder if I can pick my heart out my chest
Lately I been feelin' the worst
So I gotta dress like the best
Moncler all on my chest
VVS all on my neck
Ballin' like a fucking upset
They're beyond stressed
I been hurt but I'm beyond that

[Chorus]
I never been scared of love, scared to love
I'm on the drugs way too much
I'm not enough, not enough
You're way too much, way too much
Not scared to love, just scared of love
Not enough, I'm not enough
You're way too much and I'm not getting enough
You're way too much, still not getting enough

[Verse 2]
We woke up in hell, baby, can't you tell?
As far as I can tell, you're the only heaven here
I'm running out of Xans, running out of options
I really need to chill 'fore I'm in a coffin
Way too late, Russian roulette, okay
I know I been dead for a minute now
Ain't wanna be alive, no way

[Chorus]
I never been scared of love, scared to love
I'm on the drugs way too much
I'm not enough, not enough
You're way too much, way too much
Not scared to love, just scared of love
Not enough, I'm not enough
You're way too much and I'm not getting enough
You're way too much, still not getting enough

[Intro]
I don't know if it's because my heart hurts or if I'm insecure
I'm not sure
(Yeah, I like that)
Uh

[Chorus]
Yeah, I'm not sure
I don't know if it's because my heart hurts or if I'm insecure
Baby, you're not her
My last girl had me so fucked up, it was a blacked out blur
Baby, you jump first
It's a long way to hell, I ain't really tryna leave this Earth
Baby, do your worst
I've come to the conclusion you can't kill me if I kill you first

[Verse 1]
I've been through the wringer
Tryna put a diamond ring on her finger
She love drama, she be watching Jerry Springer
Next thing you know, we all on Jerry Springer
I play love games, but no, I'm not a cheater
She hate it when I sip codeine, I'm a leaner
The devil on my shoulder keep on telling me to keep her
Should I take her out or should I take her to the cleaner?
Love don't end good for me, no good for me
She's good for me, too good
These hoes love playing me, heartbreaking me
Don't pray for me, just give me drugs (Bring me drugs)

[Bridge]
Just give me drugs
Just bring me drugs
Just give me drugs

[Chorus]
Yeah, I'm not sure
I don't know if it's because my heart hurts or if I'm insecure
Baby, you're not her
My last girl had me so fucked up, it was a blacked out blur
Baby, you jump first
It's a long way to hell, I ain't really tryna leave this Earth
Baby, do your worst
I've come to the conclusion you can't kill me if I kill you first

[Verse 2]
I told her, "Run around and get away"
I think I need a getaway
I need to call a timeout, I need to set another play
I need a umbrella 'cause every day feel like a rainy day
I need something other than Xannies to take the pain away
I ran away to California, I'm tryna cut corners
Satan bossin' me around, but you know I don't take orders
Yeah, I had to move around, I was startin' to feel cornered
Startin' to feel cornered, I can't see the front door
Startin' to feel cornered, startin' to feel slaughtered
Started to not give a fuck, screamin' out, "Why bother?"
My ex-bitch too bad, my next bitch way hotter
We met in a car crash, she ride it like full throttle

[Chorus]
Yeah, I'm not sure
I don't know if it's because my heart hurts or if I'm insecure

Try me if you think I'm lyin', man, listen how I do it
I get brain from a smart bitch but she stupid
Put an arrow through yo heart, but no, I'm not Cupid
Make you shuffle when I shoot, but no, it's not Cupid
The wordplay is so cold, my heart is so gone
Yo bitch is so sprung, yeah, I put the team on
She gon' give the whole team head, call that a crew neck
But I'm wearin' a sweater, I'ma get her wetter, uh

I'm hotter than white bitches chillin' in a jacuzzi
My money got longer, shout out to Uzi
I'm in the scene with a nina, you run up, I'm shootin'
I swear that you don't want no problems with me, it's over with
Call me everything but sober, I am not with that sober shit
It's a union with my gang, come around like a Soviet
Matter of fact, I'm finna gamble for this shit, where your poker chips?
If you run up, you'll, you'll get cranked like Soulja did
I'ma drop bars same way I drop bombs
You ain't on shit, WW-dot-com

I never took the losin' route, I always took the losers out
Eeny meeny miney moe, I always pick the choosers out
She got titties, when she come around I pick the hooters out
Run up on me, that's okay, they beefin' on computers now?
I'm not worried about these niggas, keep a .30 on my hip
I Steph Curry about these niggas
These niggas hella soft, man I worry about these niggas
I never run away, I don't flurry away from niggas
That nigga lil' pussy, he furry, ain't he, lil' nigga?
Pull up on the scene, you know I'm with it
My windows tinted, pulled up clean with a "Stop, you're finished"
You know we dig it
I'm ballin' like Dennis Rodman, I'm fuckin' awesome
I'm bombin' like atomic, my eyes are redder than demonic
I'm faster than sonic, I'm faster, withdrawals got me fastin'
My stomach movin' slow like molasses
I got it, run up on me, I'm poppin'
Feel like Drake when I'm rappin' 'cause I start from the bottom
All this shit that I'm talkin', I could probably back it up
I slide into yo bitch DM like a sled and toboggan
For your brains I may bargain, I caught you lackin' at Target
I'll turn yo ass to a target then threw yo ass in the garbage
Run up on me, it's nothing, I swear to god that I'm bussin'
Like a Proactiv commercial or somethin', haha
These niggas makin' assumption, me, I'm just makin' this money, huh
I wear Givenchy, you still in Abercrombie, you see the difference?
Broke niggas and rich niggas, showin' the distance
This is a business relationship, fuck a friendship
All these other niggas fake like, "What you got over there?
Let me get something off your plate," nah
I did this by myself so I don't need nobody help
Shit, I'm a giant, you an elf, I put yo brains up on a shelf after I collect it
Matter of fact, my mind is my weapon
Slide through yo block again and catch some sloppy seconds
That's a preference, I heard you like talkin' about heaven
Well I send yo ass to hell, right next to Jezebel, uh, huh
You can catch twenty shells, you a fat pussy, you get shot, Garfield
I got bars like jail barbells, these niggas not funny, huh, Seinfeld, aha
But my flow is so unpredictable
Fuckin' with me is like steppin' in a minefield
Man, I could never mess up, I gotta fess up, this is a confession
I pull up on the scene with my .40, it came from my plaster
That shit's a blessing, huh, I leave you in the past tense
I wrap the rap in plastics, that's just some plaster rap
But I'm still the realest rapper after the fact, huh, can you imagine that?
Man, these niggas sick to hell, Johnson couldn't magic that
Man, this rappin' shit is such a passion
Not a father when I did it so I'm callin' me a bastard
And these niggas talkin' dumb to me
But that shit doesn't matter, 'cause my pockets gettin' fatter
And I'm climbin' like a ladder, outer space, I'm up on Saturn
With some niggas that came from my hometown
They really rowdy, you run up, that's okay
I swear to God we get to growlin' and bouncin' and pouncin'
You gon' need a bouncer, we robbin' yo accountant for everything
So much money that I ain't even count yet
Life's a bitch, why is mine keep playin' farfetched
These niggas ain't locked up, haven't seen bars yet
My gun singin' like Barbra, guess, Streisand
I got a knife in my right hand, your bitch in my left hand
Her meth in my back pocket, I'll give it to her in a second
If she keep jockin', I'll rip your eyes out of your head
If you keep watchin', I am the best rapper in here
The best rapper over there, the best rapper everywhere
I can say what I want and it come out how I want it
Run up if you want, that's okay 'cause it's over
I really do not condone it, I don't fuck with opponents
It's commas, no exponents, but these bullets come in three
And they singin' like Jonas, I don't really got no smoke
But if you want it I got it, I pull it out and I pop it
I send some shots at your noggin, I remember rockin' Robins
Back at the bottom, now it's Givenchy and Gucci
All over my pair of pockets, man, maybe I should stop it
Let's keep goin' man, I'm just feelin' nauseous
Off the Henny, that's the remedy
A hundred in these clips, so if I shoot it that's a centipede
I stick it on the Lamborghini, drivin' like a century
It's 21 inside this clip, like the century, I'm schoolin' niggas
Ruler and the Glock, elementary, I'm in her mouth like a dentist
She made me replenish, I'm ballin' like I'm Dennis
Rodman, rotten, plottin', freestyle, no jottin', I got it
Man I could rap forever, if I go broke Westwood I'ma trap forever
So cold I could go to Siberia and trap the weather
I could trap in Siberia, I could trap wherever
Man, rainy weather, sunny weather, either way, it goes
My gun with me 'cause let's go, ooh
Next beat, next beat, I may come back, ahahaha
Next part, what should I kill? Cool, uh, uh-huh, yeah, uh

[Verse 3]
Catch me spittin' on this Kill beat
Hopin' that these niggas would just feel me, the real me
My weapon is concealed and
You know I'm a suspect when I walk into the building
I came to London just to make some noise
The shit I say is for grown men, these bars are not for lil' boys
I'm Andy with these toys
You run up on me, you get flexed on like Terry Crews and steroids
Listen, I been ballin' like a Piston

Pop a roofie, I'm gone, in a whole 'nother zone
Put my dick in yo mom, that's the shit that I'm on
Yeah, that's the shit that I'm on, you ain't on shit 'cause you dumb
You run up on me, you gone, that choppa on me, it's rung
You get hung like a noose
I'm about the war, give a fuck about the truce
All about myself, I give a fuck about you
Matter of fact, I may just shoot the fuck up out you
Put an X next to your name like Malcolm
I guess you didn't weigh your options out, your outcomes
You did the wrong shit on the right day
We turn a white day into a red day
Fuck what yo mom say, fuck what yo dad say
I keep it 3K like my first name Andre
If I go broke, I'm probably servin' like an entree
In Bombay with yo girl suckin' all on me
Off the Xannies, I'm a zombie
Don't believe me, try me, fuck around, stomp you
I'm kinda hungry off the weed, I may chomp you
And that shorty, she a eater, she a muncher
Man I'm feeling like a monster
Straight Jeffrey Dahmer when I'm grippin' the Llama
You don't want problems, no smoke at all
I take your whole pound and smoke it all
I take yo bitches then fuck 'em all
They on my D, I'm hatin', I duck 'em all
And she look at my whole team then suck 'em all
Macaroni on me, it'll buck-buck 'em all
Man somebody tell me to stop, nah, I'ma keep goin', just watch
I take yo Rollie, yo watch, yo bitches all on my cock
You run up on me, get popped, they judge a nigga like Cochran
They forgot to stop it, run up on me here
I got a rocket on me, no launcher
I feel like I am the bestest, I'm deadlier than asbestos
My word is really my weapon, I'm coming back for some seconds
Freestylin's a preference, send you to stairway to heaven
Man, these niggas writin' the shit that I say
The beats beat when I'm beatin' like Doctor the Dre
I pull up on them with the choppa, and screamin' out, "Hey!
Fuck you, pow pow, have a nice day"
And my wrist is like an ice tray, and yo bitch she do what I say
Yeah, she put her hands in the air when my song come on
Like single ladies and Beyonc', yeah
And the way that I spit shit
I burn niggas like Jamaicans with the incense
Been the realest with the shit ever since I was an infant
I'm a misfit, Tony Hawk on my grind like a trip tip, you could get hit
Choppa leave you cryin' like a chick flick, I'm a sick kid
Bitch, I been lit, man these niggas ain't shit but some pussies
And pork ass niggas, fuck is a piglet
Fuck is these niggas, I don't fuck with these niggas
A four-leaf clover on a bullet, good luck with these niggas
Man it must suck for these niggas, ol' sufferin' niggas
YouTube ol' video bufferin' niggas
Ol' big bad wolf huff-puffin' ass niggas
'Til I pull up on the scene like, "You think you hard?"
I put a bullet hole through your muffin ass, nigga
Man, all the songs that I'm bumpin', I got the partiers jumpin'
You run up on me, it's over, that chopper's on me, it's dumpin'
I'll dump you like a bad relationship, hold on, wait, wait, wait
Let me take this shit, it may take a bit
I spit the shit I say, go back, re-say it
Then say somethin' different, replacin' it, man they hatin' us
It's presidential brain from yo bitch Sarah Palin kid
Still sellin' John McCain, like you got yo shit snatched
My flow is off the chain, pull up in the rover, yeah, I got the range
I feel like Drake, nothing was the same
Niggas love to hate, get up out my face before you catch a AK
Shoot him in his face, tell that nigga bye-bye, man down, mayday
Pull up to his mom house and turn it to my safe place
I need a safe haven, I'm too busy slayin'
Dyin' my hair like Super Saiyans, leave his face on the pavement
Jackie Chan when I'm smokin', I really feel like an Asian
Fuck yo bitch when I'm high, call that shit Asian persuasion
I rush out with yo girl, she fuck for hours up in the shower
I feel like I got superpowers, I'm so superb
I'm 'bout the action, you niggas 'bout action verbs
I don't gotta say a word, I shoot for the green, feelin' like Larry Bird
On the competition, I drop and take a turd
Shove it in they ears, they hearin' every word
Really though, I get it poppin' like a nigga hittin' wheelies, ho
Or an ollie, ho, or a molly, ho
Run a train on yo bitch, that's a trolley, ho
Don't try me how I do you like Dej Loaf
You want to go to heaven so bad, here's a halo
My gun sing like J Lo, you better get low like limbo
Before you catch a couple shots for yo kinfolk
I'm Rambo with the ammo, I don't never let go
Money kinda stick to me, call me Juice Velcro
Say you gettin' money now, fuck nigga hell no
You don't like Adidas but this choppa give you shell toes
This choppa give you shell toes
And leave yo ass dancin' on the floor like a red nose
Beam on my gun, that's a red nose
Pull up on the scene, let the shit blow
Yonkers, Yonkers, in this bitch with Westwood, man

Yeah, let's do it, oof, got a lil' more bounce to it, don't it?
Uh, uh, I've been going through a lot as of lately

That's just how it is, boy
My flow so brazy, my flow so cool
My flow so outdated, so old school
But then nigga switch it up to something so new
These niggas walking around like they bulletproof
'Til the bullets shoot, leave the bullets through his sunroof
Kill his son too
Give a fuck, oh, give a fuck
Nah, not what I do
I'm the type to pull up on your youth group
With a choppa and a machete, that's fuckin' useful
Matter of fact, here it go

What you call that shit? A miracle
Fuck yo bitch from the back singing negro spirituals
Got a seal, like fate, like a fuckin' envelope
I ain't dope, I'm anti-dope, word to Travis
You run up, that's okay, you gettin' played like Lenny Kravitz
I never had a father, like I said I'm such a bastard
You run up, uh, cool, I'ma let your brain splatter

But my flow is unmatched, my flow is outmatched
My flow is so hard, your flow is wack
My flow is so crack, your flow is so mid
My flow is so kill, your flow is so eh
I don't got time for it
Suck on my dick, tell your bitch to come over and swallow my kids
Choppa on my hip I had to hollow my tips
Hallowed be thy name, pray to catch his ass slippin'
Pull up on his ass leave him leakin' I get 'em
Walkin' with a limp .40 heavy like I'm pimpin'

Choke it out 'til the mutha' fuckers barely breathin'
They ain't know a rockstar could rap like this
I'ma MC off the High-Tech mixed with High-C
You don't want that

Fuck that shit I'm up in two girls
Diamonds and pearls, I'm ruling the world
Revenge on my body, bitch, 'cause that's my state of mind
Stevie Wonder like I said before 'cause I'ma rob you blind

[Verse 5]
Uh-uh, uh, uh-uh, uh, oh
Ain't no such thing as halfway
Ain't no such thing as halfway

Niggas really thinking that it's cool to make beef
And become enemies of enemies
How come all of my enemies was friends to me
How come all my enemies is frenemies
How come all my enemies is blind
I catch 'em lackin' and kill 'em before I read all they energy
I guess that's my energy

Homicide, go on and hold my gun
Specify, all the lies you've told
Look at me, what am I on?
Percy, Molly, Xanny, all that shit, in one mix

Matter of fact, let's just take a sec
Rest in peace to the niggas that left
Rest in peace to the niggas that left
And praise all the niggas that's left
I feel like I'm up in my prime
But who am I gon' share my prime with?
Who am I gon' share my time with?
Sometimes it's just perfect timing
Singing like I'm CeCe Winans
Damn, this shit's unwinding
Yuh, yeah, yeah, ayy
Suicide if you try to take my drugs
Homicide if you try to rob my plug, ayy
Homicide if you try to take my gun

All this sober shit around me is there some pills hell?
For real, I need to know
I need to know
My mama tell me that I need to let 'em go
She say the syrup in these pills finna kill me
But sometimes I think it brings out the real me
Sometimes I think it brings out the concealed me
Sometimes I think it exposes and reveals me

What happens when Juice meets the pills
Uh-uh-uh, yeah

You niggas gon' have to deal with the mess of it
I thought I told yo ass not to mess wit' it
I see this shit before I say it, telepathy
It's like I talk to my conscious, I say what it's tellin' me
Anything besides money, eh, it's kinda irrelevant
I can't focus without codeine, my medicine
I sip it until I'm slurrin' and spittin' impediments
I'm ballin' to the point where I think I need a Letterman
Westwood at the gates of London, he just had to let 'em in

You run up, I leave you leakin' on a maxi pad

Nigga, I'm takin' over the world, a map for a map

To more like Dubai, hold on

He talking stupid 'til they shoot him, that's my weapon, uh
I got a couple of bars I could spit

All the legends, where they at? They all die
Well, I don't wanna be a legend up in my prime
But, I know it's still prime time
Stars, how I shine
When they align with the planet, you know some shit is goin' on
I transform like Omegatron, when my favorite song is on
Fuckin' that bitch like the Ramadan

Talkin' stupid to me 'til I pull up let the tool blow
Emperor new school, call me Juice Kuzco

If I touch the world I told you that shit is a snow globe

Living in the moment

Interscope got me livin' a lil' proper
I'm hoping that I prosper
My gun is finna sing, that's an Opera
These niggas acting, I think they need a Oscar

Sticks and stones may break my bones
But the drugs won't hurt me, the drugs won't hurt me
Ex-girlfriend keeps calling my phone

[Verse 1: Juice WRLD]
There's love at my front door, short notice
She not like the sane girls, I noticed

Life is not the same with your pictures in my frame
Now that you're here, I want nothing to change
You pick me up when I'm down, I need you around
You seen me through my darkest times
Girl, is there something that you try to find?
You brought meaning to my life
All because of you, I do right
Because of you, I have a purpose
Fight for the world because you're worth it

Really think I found my home, shorty made me feel at home

You're my depression
Your first impression was in deception, you were lyin'

[Chorus]
Bitch, I'm still flexin' with my heart broken
Got my heart open, I'm not high yet
Bitch, I'm still moving, I'm in slow motion
I rolled my dosage, I'm getting higher
Bitch, I still, I still love my pills, Advils
You can't feel, I feel, you can't feel, I feel
Bitch, I still, I still love my pills, Advils
You can't feel, I feel, you can't feel, I feel

[Post-Chorus]
Oh, ooh, woah, oh, oh, oh-oh, oh
Oh, ooh, woah, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh-ah

[Verse]
*exhaling*
Fell in love with your face off the shrooms
The way it animates your eyes in the room
I can see the stars when I'm gazing at you
Now I need the car with the stars in the roof, ooh
Elephant all in the room, she buried me in a tomb
I'm feeling over consumed
She walking me to my doom, I see her face in my room
When I'm alone in the room, I'ma blame that on the shrooms

[Bridge]
Oh, feeling ridiculed, feeling like a fool, don't know what to do
Lost my heart, don't got shit to lose

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm holding my breath and watching my step
I'm listing regrets and you made that list
You're my depression
Your first impression wasn't deception, you were lyin'

Bitch, I'm still flexin' with my heart broken
Got my heart open, I'm not high yet
Bitch, I'm still moving, I'm in slow motion

You can't feel, I feel, you can't feel, I feel
Bitch, I still, I still love my pills, Advils
You can't feel, I feel, you can't feel, I feel

And we live
And we recording
And there's lean on deck, y'know?
Purple Rain
Okay, so

[Chorus]
I just popped a bean yesterday, it was a long night
I done did the right drugs, only on the wrong night
I was rocking Off-White, tryna have a fun time
She gon' eat like lunch time, molly got her on time
Fuck niggas don't get respect, but I'ma die about mine
Swervo told me stop popping them Xannies 'fore I flatline
I said hold on, bro wait, I'ma be fine
I said hold on, bro wait, I'ma be fine
I said hold on, bro wait, I'ma be fine
I said hold on, bro wait, I'ma be fine
I said hold on, bro wait, I'ma be fine
I'ma be fine, I'ma be fine

[Verse 1]
But in the meantime, bitch, it's lean time
Pop a bean time 'cause it ain't killing me
My lil' bro keep a .40, they thought his ass was security
Too busy making money to worry 'bout making memories
But in the meantime, bitch, it's green time
Maybe lean time, outta energy
My momma told me, "Stop the painkillers"
Them shits is killing me, I'ma be fine

[Chorus]
I just popped a bean yesterday, it was a long night
I done did the right drugs, only on the wrong night
I was rocking Off-White, tryna have a fun time
She gon' eat like lunchtime, molly got her on time
Fuck niggas don't get respect, but I'ma die about mine
Swervo told me stop popping them Xannies 'fore I flatline
I said hold on, bro wait
I'ma be fine, I'ma be fine, I'ma be fine

[Verse 2]
They know my name hold weight
Put it in her mouth just like Colgate
Get outta line and you get punched in your face
Shouldn't have been around here in the first place
Now you got a black eye
I got mob ties, I got gang ties
Make you drown in your blood, just like high tide
Now I'm up, everybody wanna high five
Remember when they used to diss me in the lunch line
Now I'm eating steak and eggs when it's lunchtime
I remember eating Ramen with a Glock .9
I remember when she left me for the next guy
Now she calling me her next guy

[Chorus]
I just popped a bean yesterday, it was a long night
I done did the right drugs, only on the wrong night
I was rocking Off-White, tryna have a fun time
She gon' eat like lunch time, molly got her on time
Fuck niggas don't get respect, but I'ma die about mine
Swervo told me stop popping them Xannies 'fore I flatline
I said hold on, bro wait, I'ma be fine
I said hold on, bro wait, I'ma be fine
I said hold on, bro wait, I'ma be fine
I said hold on, bro wait, I'ma be fine
I said hold on, bro wait, I'ma be fine
I'ma be fine, I'ma be fine

[Outro]
I woke up Xanning
I sit down, I can't stand it anymore
Can't stand it anymore, more
I woke up leaning, so I woke up dreaming
And fiending for more, for more, for more
One cup, I need four more, hey
I woke up leaning, so I woke up dreaming
And fiending for more, for more, for more
One cup, I need four more, hey

[Intro]
Vibe on this bitch, though
A lighter?
Nah, in the room
Oh
Uh-huh

[Verse 1]
You work numbers, work wonders
You done woke me up from my eternal slumber
I'm the lightning, you're the thunder
There's a difference 'tween, "I need you," and, "I want you"
Girl, I need you
Good sex led to conversations getting a little deeper, uh
Tell me your darkest secrets, shit you wouldn't even tell Jesus, uh
My karma been tweaking so much, I don't even believe in karma
But you give me a reason to thank God for all these recent falls
Percocet 30 E 8, I've been gettin' off
I done chilled out on the drugs since you've been involved
Suck it like it's love, fuck me like it's love
No protection on my heart, goddamnit, I'm gon' hit it raw
Traumatized from my past, yeah, I keep a log
In my mind, in my head, where that shit belong
They say you after my bread, shit, I hope they wrong
You already ran up the bands, we could have a ball
Hit it from the back, humina, call a play, huddle up
This that good love in the bedroom
Fuck you in the Prada, poke her face like Lady Gaga
Ride it like a Mazda, zoom, zoom, zoom

[Chorus]
I'm all, I'm really all in
In love with all your flaws and sins
Your scars are really gorgeous
Ain't that a weird way to give compliments?
I'm all, I'm really all in
I fell in love with all your flaws and sins
Your scars are really gorgeous
I see your light in all the darkness

[Verse 2]
Woah
'Atta boy, I done turned to a man
Hot chills when my skin is on your skin
Hope you know that if you ever try to end
You gon' catch a couple out the F&N
That mean Cupid ain't give you a headshot
So I ain't got no choice but to leave you with a headshot
Look at the way I make that fucking bed rock, uh
Where your ring finger at? I need wedlock
Got my sights on your ass, ooh, red dot
We some bats that made it out of Hell, ooh, red hot
Don't, ayy, go all night, bitch, don't stop
We ain't even gon' be finished 'til the sun's up

[Chorus]
I'm all, I'm really all in
In love with all your flaws and sins
Your scars are really gorgeous
Ain't that a weird way of giving compliments?
I'm all, I'm really all in
In love with all your flaws and sins
Your scars are really gorgeous
That's my way of giving compliments
I'm all, I'm really all in
In love with all your flaws and sins
Your scars are really gorgeous
Ain't that a weird way to give compliments?
I'm all, I'm really all in
I fell in love with all your flaws and sins
Your scars are really gorgeous
I see light in all the darkness

It's hard for me to let go

[Verse]
I been drinkin' and drivin' and survivin'
Take my sorrow and bury me alive in it

She already knows
It's hard for me to let go

[Chorus]
I got a feeling
Percs help me feel it, I feel it, uh
Problems, I numb and conceal them
Kinda like my feelings, but I still feel them
I just walked in the building
Look like a million, but I'm worth more than a million
I don't need no Ritalin, I'm focused on the millions
Disregard civilians
Until I get a house with a moat and a pavilion

[Verse 1]
I reek of good vibes
Smokin' on reefer, I'm high
Percocet fever
The type of pill to make you scratch until your nails gone (Yeah, yeah)
Drugs in my head, you heard what I said
No five, no ten, no fifteen, twenty, just Perc-30's in my meds
I told my mama I'm here to stay, no, she won't catch me dead
I'm too much of an idol, nigga, no Ryan Seacrest
Do it by my V-lone, 'lone
(This is about you, not me)
Alone, alone, alone (Slatt)

[Chorus]
I got a feeling
Percs help me feel it, I feel it, uh
Problems, I numb and conceal them
Kinda like my feelings, but I still feel them
I just walked in the building
Look like a million, but I'm worth more than a million
I don't need no Ritalin, I'm focused on the millions
Disregard civilians
Until I get a house with a moat and a pavilion

[Verse 2]
'Til I get a house with a moat and a pavilion
Walked into your building, nigga, I'm a villain
Feel like Dragon Ball, bitch, I'm Goku and you Krillin
Bickin' back, I'm boolin', these niggas be chillin'
All up in they feelings, me, I'm just winning
W-I-N-N-I-N-G (Spell it)
Boy, it's ain't no "I" in team but it's an "M-E" in team (Fuck)
I meant it's a "me" in team (Yeah)
I know I just fucked up, but bitch, I'm still the freestyle king, whoa
Her pussy wetter than olive oil, my watch cost a hundred more
My new girl a Lamborghin', your girl a Honda Accord
Mama told me I gotta stay focused, told her I am not a Ford
Focused, you notice when it disappear like hocus pocus

[Chorus]
I got a feeling
Percs help me feel it, I feel it, uh
Problems, I numb and conceal them
Kinda like my feelings, but I still feel them
I just walked in the building
Look like a million, but I'm worth more than a million
I don't need no Ritalin, I'm focused on the millions
Disregard civilians
Until I get a house with a moat and a pavilion (Let's go, let's go, let's go)

[Intro]
Ooh
Ooh-oh-oh
She told me that it's all my fault
It woulda been a right and not another wrong (Huh)

[Chorus]
She told me that it's all my fault, it woulda been perfect all along
It woulda been a right and not another wrong
And it would be a happy not a sad song, oh
'Cause it's all my fault, she would have been perfect on her own
I should have took a right but I took a wrong
And now this ain't a happy, it's a sad song, oh

[Verse]
She like a mouse in a mouse trap, stuck up
She got me rolling weed now, I'm fucked up
You talking too much, so shut the fuck up
You heated too much, you're high, the summer
I'll let you cool down
And I brought you 'round momma
But you let me down, yeah, you let me drown in drama
You talking too much, so shut the fuck up
You talking too much, so shut the fuck up
You talking too much, so shut the fuck up
You talking too much, so shut the fuck up

But you let me down, yeah, you let me drown in drama

[Chorus]
She told me that it's all my fault, it woulda been perfect all along
It woulda been a right and not another wrong
And it would be a happy not a sad song, oh

I should have took a right but I took a wrong
And now this ain't a happy it's a sad song, oh

[Bridge]
She told me thats it's all my fault
It would've been a right and not another wrong
And it would be a happy, not a sad song
'Cause it's all my fault

And now this ain't a happy, it's a sad song

[Chorus]
She told me that it's all my fault, it woulda been perfect all along

[Intro]
Stuck in a maze
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Stuck in a maze, mmh

[Chorus]
Stuck in a maze
Everything's okay but it's not really okay
My life's a death race
I'm numbing my pain with codeine rain
I'm going insane
Life's not the same
Stuck in a maze
I'm not going in
My brain is going everywhere
I'm tormented every day
Mama, I'm losing my mental
The sorrows that I've been through
Story to be continued

[Verse]
I sip ill, pop pills, crack seals
Doing anything to numb the weight that I feel, yeah
I chase thrills, you still crashin' Hot Wheels
Ride a dirt bike down the ditch, see if I live
I'm not in my subconscious, I'm conscious
They tell me that they can help me, I got this
Watch this, I took my demons into the bank of life and I made the biggest deposit
Without drugs, I'm losing my logic
These pills and my Pro Tools still got logic
I run, I run, I run
I run, I run, I run

[Chorus]
Stuck in a maze
Everything's okay but it's not really okay
My life's a death race
I'm numbing my pain with codeine rain
I'm going insane
Life's not the same
Stuck in a maze
I'm not going in
My brain is going everywhere
I'm tormented every day
Mama, I'm losing my mental
The sorrows that I've been through
Story to be continued

[Intro]
I figured she was gonna break my heart regardless, regardless
I figured she was gonna break my heart regardless
So I took her out and dumped her in the garbage
The stupid bitch done turned herself into a target
Click, clack

[Chorus]
She was gonna break my heart regardless
So I took her out and dumped her in the garbage
Stupid bitch done turned herself into a target (Yeah)
Just for talkin' nonsense, claiming she was leavin'

[Verse 1]
Not gonna happen
If I can't have you, no one can
'Cause if you leave, I'm not breathin'
I'll show you how it feels not to breathe, breathe
Inhale, exhale
You're the best, well
You're the worst, but
You're the best, hell
I ain't ever, ever gonna lose, lose
Tell me what I gotta do to prove to you
Five seconds from losing my head
Now it's time to show you what lunatics do

[Chorus]
She was gonna break my heart regardless
So I took her out and dumped her in the garbage
The stupid bitch done turned herself into a target (Yeah)
Just for talkin' nonsense, claiming she was leavin'
I figured she was gonna break my heart regardless
So I took her out and dumped her in the garbage
The stupid bitch done turned herself into a target (Yeah)
Just for talkin' nonsense, claiming she was leavin'

[Verse 2]
Hate it when you tease
Where you think you're goin'? When you comin' back from me?
You walked in, I'm listening to "Stan" on E, yeah, ecstasy
Matter of fact there's a bridge that my car wants to meet
Road trip on me, it'll be fun, you'll see
But you don't gotta sit in the trunk, you can sit next to me
Me and Stan, we alike, but he ain't nicer than me
He was drunk drivin', me, I'm just straight Perc-ules

[Outro]
My crazy thoughts and your crazy heart
'Cause we hit the bridge, that's just the start
Not afraid to die, as you can see
Life isn't real, love's make believe
My crazy thoughts and your crazy heart
'Cause we hit the bridge, that's just the start
Not afraid to die, as you can see
Life isn't real, love's make believe

[Intro]
Ooh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, yeah
Bitches on me, that's often
Doin' them beans often
Purps on the beat

[Chorus]
She know me well, well, well, she know me well (Uh-huh)
Told me she loved me still, bitch, go to hell (Uh-huh)
All the drugs I did, it was worth it (Yeah)
Super worth it (Uh)
Tell me why you had me feelin' worthless (Yeah)
Now your heart broken, you need a surgeon (Yeah)
I know one thing for sure, one thing for certain (Yeah)
I know one thing's for sure, one thing's for certain (Yeah, yeah, yeah)

[Verse 1]
We ain't gon' do this, not again
Gucci cardigan, I'm the flyest gent
I found out what the problem is, breakin' promises
It was the both of us

[Refrain]
Oh, all girls the same, same, same
Two blue pills to the brain, brain, brain
Yeah, I kinda miss your brain
And I bet you miss my fame

[Chorus]
She know me well, well, well, she know me well (Uh-huh)
Told me she loved me still, bitch, go to hell (Uh-huh)
All the drugs I did, it was worth it (Yeah)

Tell me why you had me feelin' worthless (Yeah)
Now your heart broken, you need a surgeon (Yeah)
I know one thing for sure, one thing for certain (Yeah)
I know one thing's for sure, one thing's for certain (Yeah, yeah, yeah)

[Verse 2]
I bet I'll never die again
Bullets fly again, Cupid hit his target
Guess he's been target practicing
Devils panickin', it makes it worse for my heart

[Refrain]
Oh, girls aren't the same, same, same
But it's still two pills to the brain, brain, brain
I hope you never change, change, change
I also hope we put the drugs away

[Bridge]
Well, well, well, well
She do me well
I hope she loves me for real
'Cause I been through hell
All the drugs I did
They weren't worth it, now I'm worthless
I hope my new lady thinks I'm perfect, oh
Sometimes I feel like that she'll be better off
Without me but without her I would die, oh
I would die, oh

[Chorus]
She know me well, well, well, she know me well (Uh-huh)
Told me she loved me still, bitch, go to hell (Uh-huh)
All the drugs I did, it was worth it (Yeah)
Super worth it (Uh)
Tell me why you had me feelin' worthless (Yeah)
Now your heart broken, you need a surgeon (Yeah)
I know one thing for sure, one thing for certain (Yeah)
I know one thing's for sure, one thing's for certain (Yeah, yeah, yeah)

[Intro]
Why you mad, why you mad?
Why you mad, why you mad?
That is all I wanna know
You're lookin' like a joke, dry humor at the most
Steady chokin' on your shade like a dick in your throat
Well if you're gonna throw shade my way
Maybe you should throw with a little more aim
It's a cold day in hell when they dirty up your name
They don't got no business talkin' in the first place, I'm freezin'
(Freezin', bitch I'm freezin', freezin', freezin', freezin', freezin')

[Chorus]
All these fuck niggas on my line
Damn nigga you must wanna die tonight
Yeah, I rock a choker with a .45
And I know some niggas that are down to ride
All these hatin' bitches on my line
Damn bitch you must wanna fuck tonight
Let me guess, you're my biggest fan, right?
You wanted an autograph
All you had to do was ask, woah (Huh)

[Verse 1]
But you lookin' like an asshole
Up on Twitter and you lookin' mad, woah
Talkin' bout me, but you lookin' bad, woah
Like the ugly daughter that I never had, woah
And what's up with these niggas?
Got my name in they mouth like they swallowin' my children
I never got why niggas hate
It's probably cause I'm doin' better than them anyway
It's probably cause I get they bitches wetter anyway
It's probably cause I'm livin' and they're in a lower place
They walkin' in the slums while I'm vibin' out in space
Crash land just to take they girl on a dinner date
When haters see me winnin' they just hyperventilate
They always try to stop me but I never hesitate
Just follow all your dreams and when you reach them, celebrate
That's the only way to truly make a hater suffocate

[Chorus]
All these fuck niggas on my line
Damn nigga you must wanna die tonight
Yeah, I rock a choker with a .45
And I know some niggas that are down to ride
All these hatin' bitches on my line
Damn bitch you must wanna fuck tonight
Let me guess, you're my biggest fan, right?
You wanted an autograph
All you had to do was ask, woah

[Verse 2]
Why you mad, why you mad?
Why you mad, why you mad?
That's all I wanna know
You're lookin' like a joke, dry humor at the most
Steady chokin' on your shade like a dick in your throat
Well if you're gonna throw shade my way
Maybe you should throw with a little more aim
It's a cold day in hell when they dirty up your name
They don't got no business talkin' in the first place, I'm freezin'
But these haters not breathin'
Stevie Wonder to these haters no seein'
And I don't believe it
They hate me, hate me for no reason
They hate me for no reason, woah
Oh-oh-oh

[Chorus]
All these fuck niggas on my line
Damn nigga you must wanna die tonight
Yeah, I rock a choker with a .45
And I know some niggas that are down to ride
All these hatin' bitches on my line
Damn bitch you must wanna fuck tonight
Let me guess, you're my biggest fan, right?
You wanted an autograph
All you had to do was ask, woah

[Chorus]
This is as far as it goes
This the end of the road
This the end of the rope
The other end at her throat
It's suicidal she wrote
This is the end of the show, it's over
We doin' drugs 'til we in a coma

[Verse 1]
We don't love these hoes, our hearts got colder
It's hard out here for a lonely stoner
I know I'm doing drugs, but so what?
Just pray to God I never throw up
I pray to God my plug, I blow up
I pray to God my plug still show up
I know the last time, we tried to rob him
He lucky, bro'nem ain't fucking off him
I'm drinking, driving in the Bentley coupe, so
It's hard for me to drive, I move too slow
I told you, baby, I ain't saving no hoe
I only save the money; antihero
I burned my old clothes and got some new clothes
I left my old hoes and got some new hoes
My brother got a chopper and it's kickin' like Judo
He shootin' while I'm drivin' the two-door

[Chorus]
This is as far as it goes
This the end of the road
This the end of the rope
The other end at her throat
It's suicidal she wrote
This is the end of the show, it's over
We doin' drugs 'til we in a coma
This is as far as it goes
This the end of the road
This the end of the rope
The other end at her throat
It's suicidal she wrote
This is the end of the show, it's over
We doin' drugs 'til we in a coma

[Verse 2]
I'm smokin' dope 'til I'm in a coma
The moon rock on me, I love the aroma
I get so high that I'm in the clouds with the fallen angels
Demons with halos
She love the coke, but not Coca-Cola
But she'll still pop it like a soda for ya
Her name rings bells like a Motorola
I lay the bitch off like I'm her employer
And she gon' ride like a roller coaster
And I'm gon' hide when the love is over
But it's far from over, losing composure
In a coffin, laying stiff like a boulder

[Chorus]
This is as far as it goes
This the end of the road
This the end of the rope
The other end of her throat
It's suicidal she wrote
This is the end of the show, it's over
We doin' drugs 'til we in a coma
This is as far as it goes
This the end of the road
This the end of the rope
The other end at her throat
It's suicidal she wrote
This is the end of the show, it's over
We doin' drugs 'til we in a coma

[Intro]
Another life
Another day, another blunt
Another day, another lie, blunt
Another night, another day, another night, another...
(Hit-Boy)

[Verse 1]
Another life, another day, another chance to make it great
I'm running to the money all the time so I can never be late
Just me and my bitch, even though she drive me crazy, she still make my day

[Chorus]
Going through motions, muddy emotions
Going through motions, muddy emotions
Going through motions, muddy emotions
Back on my bullshit, devil emoji
Going through motions, muddy emotions
Going through motions, muddy emotions
Going through motions, muddy emotions
Back on my bullshit, devil emoji

[Verse 2]
Boat rocking back and forth, what's the commotion?
I told her I'ma drown in her, that bitch an ocean
If I can't make her smile, I'ma be acting wild
She got a new man, I'm gon' pull up on him and shoot him down
I been goin' through emotions, bloody emotions
Pour me a cup, I'ma nod out
Started pack smokin', good dope rollin'
Maybe Mary Jane'll help me put the pills down
Dead inside, catch a look at my ghost
I pull up in a Lambo' or 'Rari or Rolls
Got my girl by my side and they callin' us goals
Numb the pain, take these Percs to the mouth and the nose
I'm not a drug addict, got it all wrong
I'm just a love addict 'til my heart gone
I'm just a love addict with the love songs
You with me is where you belong

[Chorus]
Going through motions, muddy emotions
Going through motions, muddy emotions
Going through motions, muddy emotions
Back on my bullshit, devil emoji
Going through motions, muddy emotions
Going through motions, muddy emotions
Going through motions, muddy emotions
Back on my bullshit, devil emoji

[Verse: Juice WRLD]
Uh, acidic, a bunch of bad habits with bad magic
Can't disappear and re-appear in the same sentence, I'm bad at it
The Mad Hatter, the Perc packer
The mom thrasher
The Perc mixed with the syrup turn me into a contractor
A straight tweak, so high I can't speak
Been three weeks, I still haven't met my peak
Like I could be someone other than myself
Like I could find a little Heaven up in my Hell
Yeah I know it never ever end well
Yeah I know I always fall victim to a rich spell
Uh, like abracadabra
The flow so raw, forgot to grab Magnums
Been raw-doggin' bitches ever since I went platinum
I feel like Hell full of bad bitches
Wonder if it's room in Heaven for savages
My life's a canvas, I'm paintin' in blood like a cannibal
Rip off his head and I salvage it, huh
A little too graphic
At least you niggas know that I still got the passion
Of someone who don't got shit, but the clothes on they back
And its been that way since way back since
Like I'm a killer or somethin'
These niggas lip-singin' like Milli Vanilli or somethin'
I'm like Lil' Wayne I got a milli-milli-milli or somethin'
I guess, I'm rich, in broke pockets
Bountiful, my soul's empty, so deep, ten feet

[Interlude: Juice WRLD]
Times ten feet
Fuck love, it's gon' take more to convince me, that you with me
And not against me
Where I'm from we loaded up
Pop out and turn niggas into mince meat

[Outro: T-Pain]
Follies on a Tuesday, not one but two
Not one stack or two

[Intro]
Cardo got wings
Now we cookin' up, hey
Yeah
Leave her in the past, but I know I'll miss her
I kept all of her paraphernalia
Left her makeup and her panties on my bedroom dresser
Think about the days when I used to undress her

[Chorus]
Long gone, long gone, long gone (Ayy)
Long gone, long gone, long gone (Ayy)
Long gone, long gone, long gone
Long gone (Yeah, ayy)

[Verse 1]
Sorrow and sadness next to me
Old hoes see that I'm on, so they textin' me
Ex-bitch tryna finesse me, she won't get a damn thing
Listen to my story, it's depressing
Heartbreak mixed with the drugs, not the best ending
The devil tryna test me I'm failing, inhaling
You took it all back
All that heartbreak, that was a year ago
Wanted you back, so bad, but that's...

[Chorus]
Long gone, long gone, long gone (Ayy)
Long gone, long gone, long gone (Ayy)
Long gone, long gone, long gone
Long gone

[Bridge]
What you don't seem to understand is
You really took my love for granted
You really had me feeling helpless, that's so selfish

[Verse 2]
Haven't been in love in a long while
Wait until my next girl finds out
Then I'm scared we gon' break up and fall out
Drownin' in my thoughts, baby, looking for a lighthouse
Ain't no sleep, I've been feeling like a night owl
Music turnt up, neighbors telling me to pipe down
On the other hand, I think I found my future wife
But she not here with me, so it get lonely at night, ayy

[Pre-Chorus]
I hope, her love doesn't go away
I hope this ain't a phase
One more heartbreak and I'll be...

[Chorus]
Long gone, long gone, long gone (Ayy)
Long gone, long gone, long gone (Ayy)
Long gone, long gone, long gone
Long gone
Long gone, long gone, long gone (Ayy)
Long gone, long gone, long gone (Ayy)
Long gone, long gone, long gone
Long gone

[Outro]
Leave her in the past, but I know I'll miss her
I kept all of her paraphernalia
Left her makeup and her panties on my bedroom dresser
Think about the days when I used to undress her

[Chorus]
Her face ain't ever matching her persona, yeah
I mix Xanax with the strongest marijuana, yeah
You want problems? I roll with the problem solvers, yeah
I got six shots in this gun, it's a revolver, yeah
Dye my hair on that bullshit, like Rodman
I'm like Jordan, you ball like Craig Hodges, yeah
Feel like Drake 'cause I started from the bottom
I keep two Magnums, a gun and a condom

[Verse 1]
Wait wait they tryna set me up, huh
But they can't set me up, huh

Pull up to his block and I wet it up
I'm on the ground off the Xanax and Perkys
I need me a pick me up, huh
I got so drunk last night bro had to come pick me up, yeah
Swerve on a highway huh, living the high way, huh
She fuck her friend for the night, huh
She go the bi way, huh
She got the Molly and champagne
Told her to bring that shit my way, huh
We couldn't make it into the house
She sucked me in the driveway, huh
I never gave her the runaround
I'ma always keep a gun around
Heat on my hip like the sun around
Ball like the OKC Thunder round
Hennessy, I need a couple rounds
Moving no work I got hella pounds
Fuck up a check, I got hella bands
Bandana on me like Taliban
Motorola, Motorola 'cause I love my trap phone
Feel like Batman when I'm robbin' 'cause I keep a bat phone
I've been trapping in the basement even when my mom home
Sorry, mama, but I gotta keep the fucking lights on, ayy

[Chorus]
Her face ain't ever matching her persona, yeah
I mix Xanax with the strongest marijuana, yeah
You want problems? I roll with the problem solvers, yeah
I got six shots in this gun, it's a revolver, yeah
Dye my hair on that bullshit, like Rodman
I'm like Jordan, you ball like Craig Hodges, yeah
Feel like Drake 'cause I started from the bottom
I keep two Magnums, a gun and a condom

[Verse 2]
I keep two guns, I keep two cups
I had to lose her, it was too much to say I don't care
Could give two fucks
Remember when she topped me on my tour bus
Throw 'Xannys in the crowd to make the tour bus
She got a model body, that bitch gorgeous
We run up in your spot and shoot from the floor up
Now you tore up, bitch you tore up, ayy

[Chorus]
Her face ain't ever matching her persona, yeah
I mix Xanax with the strongest marijuana, yeah
You want problems? I roll with the problem solvers, yeah

Until I pop out with a million (I pop)
Take 20K and put that on your head
And make one of your partners come kill you (Yeah)
Say he fuckin' with me then he gotta grow up

Use the brain in your head 'fore you lose it (Bitch)
I'll pull up after school and I'll teach her some shit
Tell your bro I'm a motherfuckin' tutor

Fucked up her hair, she look bad today

The shit was wack, I didn't sign that (Uh)
I'm the best, but never mind that (Okay)
My shit so hard that they rewind that (Ah)
Got that work if you can't find that (Huh?)
You can't afford it, we can finance

Got my dick in your bitch, she be bendin' it over and bustin' it open and throwin' it back
I'm tryna go fuck her buddy
Fuck all these hoes, 'cause they don't really love me
I'm tryna get me some motherfuckin' money
If they free Meek Mill, why they ain't free my cousin?
I bet we shoot up your motherfuckin' party if somebody touch me or one of my brothers
I bet won't none of these niggas that talk on the internet try me, they see me in public
I bet they play all my motherfuckin' teachin'
Bitch, I don't rap, I be motherfuckin' preachin'
I bet you paid for that motherfuckin' show and I bet you paid for that motherfuckin' feature (Bitch)

[Chorus]
I'm on they ass today, I just went and picked me up a bag today

Shout out my BM, that's me, me (Me, me)
We pull up with like 400 rounds (Four deep)
It's just me and Ri, Dada and T.G. (On gang)
I got my jewelry from Johnny (It's a movie)
Turn on that motherfuckin' TV (Ice)
Everyone, turn off your lights
I bet you still motherfuckin' see me (Yeah)
You know it's a light show (Ha)
Pull up with that iron
You know I got it everywhere that I go
Really out my mind
Come playin' with me, he gon' die slow (Ayy, ayy)
They think I'm a psycho (Ha)
Like my money blue, y'all niggas green
I do this with my eyes closed
Put me in a room, four hundred niggas
Gimme a blindfold
'Cause you niggas ain't 'bout that (Bitch)
Lemme see where that mouth at
When I pull out that iron
I bet you niggas gon' wanna give that clout back
And if I wasn't rich and already lit
I'd pull up where your house at
But, you know God great and everything's straight
Took a loss and I bounced back
You will never hear a diss, I ain't gon' say shit
I ain't finna talk back (Ha)

[Chorus]
I'm thinkin' 'bout takin' it out
It's hard to pop shit with my grill in
I can't let it fuck up my flow
Let these lil' niggas run up the score and I still win
I told Her im that nigga without it
He touch me, he gon' die on the scene
I'ma pay me a lawyer and sit in the county (No cap)
You ain't built how I'm built, they ain't seen what I seen
I don't want none of these niggas around me, nigga

[Outro]
Huh (Bitch ass nigga)

EarlOnTheBeat

[Verse]
Who shot your homeboy? A nigga with a diaper on?
Got on the City Girls beat and got a cypher on?
Your girl said she diggin' with DaBaby, right or wrong? (EarlOnTheBeat)
Just gave me head in the rental car while the lights was on
You know me, I be chillin' and coolin', know I'm the shit with the music
Since you in love with computers, go look my name up on Google
And please don't turn to no groupie, others niggas be goofy
Might as well get some popcorn, we finna make this a movie
Somewhere laid up with a stallion, lettin' them haters hate
Eatin' jumbo shrimp with the steak off of a paper plate
Ballin' on 'em like Michael Jordan back in '88
Got my dick sucked before my flight, it almost made me late
I'm in a different bracket than rappers, these niggas can't relate
Don't make me get to slappin' these rappers, give 'em a change of face
Made so many racks off of trappin', say I was slangin' weight
Put the weed down and start eatin', they say I'm gainin' weight
Who shot ya? That lil' nigga with the pamper baby?
With twenty pounds of Cali weed inside the hamper baby?
Your girl said she throw the- ah ah ah
I pull up with the bald fade like a cancer- ahh
Who shot ya? That lil' nigga be on Instagram?
Do what the fuck he want to do like he don't give a damn?
Just got some head outside the show inside the sprinter van?
They say I'm a fool 'cause I'm coolin', smooth as a ceiling fan
You need to get your boss, I ain't tryin' to talk to no middleman
I'm chargin' just to talk, nothin' personal, I'm a businessman

[Outro]
Huh?

Pussy good, it had me stalkin' her (Woo)

Fallin' in love with her (Ha)

[Verse]
Joke's on you, bitch (Yeah)
'Cause I tell a ho what she wanna hear and pull up with a new bitch (Uh huh)
You already know if I walk out the door I ain't leavin' with you, bitch (No)

Her pussy wet, her mouth and neck just like a cruise ship (Ayy)
You probably still fuckin' them hoes I went to school with (Ha)
You probably askin' around about me on some nut shit (What up?)

"Why we can't fuck, you just want head?" 'Cause you a duck, bitch (Yes)

Everything's a true story (Everything's a true story)

[Chorus]
I had my mind on the milli'

Her mama came, knocked on the door, she said she gotta pee
She had too much to drink (Damn)
I had to hide in the shower
And that's when I found out her mama a freak (A freak)
She came and sat on the toilet
And pulled out her phone but ain't lift up the seat (Huh?)
I saw her play with that pussy (Hold up)
Holding a picture of me (Damn)

[Chorus]
I had my mind on the milli'
I went and copped a Cuban from Shyne out in Philly
I went broke and sold it, mad that I did it
Flew out to Cali, got bags and I sent 'em
Ever fall off, get some change from a freak (Freak)
We leavin' stains on the sheets (Huh?)
You might wanna change up yo keys (Keys)
I got yo' bitch name on the leash (Yeah)

[Verse 2]
I had this lil' ho from the city, she really went with it
Stay down like a G (Yeah, yeah)
I gave her way too much salt
Now she fuck with a nigga that play in the league (The league)
I put a hoe through the most (The most)
I make a pretty bitch leave (Leave)
I might end up playin' with you (You)
'Cause you ain't gonna be playin' with me (Yeah)
I used to fuck with a bitch that ain't even pay (Yeah)
Rent she be stayin' for free (Yeah, yeah, yeah)

KSR
It's Cardi, ayy
Said I'm the shit, they can't fuck with me if they wanted to
I dont gotta dance

[Chorus]
Said lil' bitch, you can't fuck with me if you wanted to
These expensive, these is red bottoms, these is bloody shoes
Hit the store, I can get 'em both, I don't wanna choose
And I'm quick, cut a nigga off, so don't get comfortable, look
I don't dance now, I make money moves (Ayy, ayy)
Say I don't gotta dance, I make money move
If I see you and I don't speak, that means I don't fuck with you
I'm a boss, you a worker, bitch, I make bloody moves

[Verse 1]
Now she say she gon' do what to who? Let's find out and see
Cardi B, you know where I'm at, you know where I be
You in the club just to party, I'm there, I get paid a fee
I be in and out them banks so much, I know they're tired of me
Honestly, don't give a fuck 'bout who ain't fond of me
Dropped two mixtapes in six months, what bitch working as hard as me?
I don't bother with these hoes, don't let these hoes bother me
They see pictures, they say, "Goals," bitch, I'm who they tryna be
Look, I might just chill in some BAPE
I might just chill with your boo, I might just feel on your babe
My pussy feel like a lake
He wanna swim with his face, I'm like, "Okay"
I'll let him get what he want, he buy me Yves Saint Laurent
And the new whip, when I go fast as a horse, I got the trunk in the front
I'm the hottest in the street, know you prolly heard of me
Got a bag and fixed my teeth, hope you hoes know it ain't cheap
And I pay my mama bills, I ain't got no time to chill
Think these hoes be mad at me, their baby father run a bill

[Chorus]
Said lil' bitch, you can't fuck with me if you wanted to
These expensive, these is red bottoms, these is bloody shoes
Hit the store, I can get 'em both, I don't wanna choose
And I'm quick, cut a nigga off, so don't get comfortable, look
I don't dance now, I make money moves
Say I don't gotta dance, I make money move
If I see you and I don't speak, that means I don't fuck with you
I'm a boss, you a worker, bitch, I make bloody moves

[Verse 2]
If you a pussy, you get popped, you a goofy, you a opp
Don't you come around my way, you can't hang around my block
And I just checked my accounts, turns out, I'm rich, I'm rich, I'm rich
I put my hand above my hip, I bet you dip, he dip, she dip
I say I get the money and go, this shit is hot like a stove
My pussy glitter is gold, tell that lil' bitch play her role
I just arrove in a Rolls, I just came up in a Wraith
I need to fill up the tank, no, I need to fill up the safe
I need to let all these hoes know that none of their niggas is safe
I go to dinner and steak, only the real can relate
I used to live in the P's, now it's a crib with a gate
Rollie got charms, look like Frosted Flakes
Had to let these bitches know, just in case these hoes forgot
I just run and check the mail, another check from Mona Scott

[Chorus]
Said lil' bitch, you can't fuck with me if you wanted to
These expensive, these is red bottoms, these is bloody shoes
Hit the store, I can get 'em both, I don't wanna choose
And I'm quick, cut a nigga off, so don't get comfortable, look
I don't dance now, I make money moves
Say I don't gotta dance, I make money move
If I see you and I don't speak, that means I don't fuck with you
I'm a boss, you a worker, bitch, I make bloody moves

[Intro]
Yeah
Care for me, care for me, care for me, uh
Yeah, look

[Verse 1]
I wanna get married, like the Currys, Steph and Ayesha shit
But we more like Belly'Tommy and Keisha shit
Gave you TLC, you wanna creep and shit
Poured out my whole heart to a piece of shit
Man, I thought you would've learned your lesson
'Bout likin' pictures, not returnin' texts
I guess it's fine, man, I get the message
You still stutter after certain questions
You keep in contact with certain exes
Do you, though, trust me, nigga, it's cool, though
Said that you was workin', but you out here chasin' culo
And putas, chillin' poolside, livin' two lives
I could've did what you did to me to you a few times
But if I did decide to slide, find a nigga
Fuck him, suck his dick, you would've been pissed
But that's not my M.O., I'm not that type of bitch
And karma for you is gon' be who you end up with
You make me sick, nigga

[Chorus]
The only man, baby, I adore
I gave you everything, what's mine is yours
I want you to live your life of course
But I hope you get what you dyin' for
Be careful with me, do you know what you doin'?
Whose feelings that you're hurtin' and bruisin'?
You gon' gain the whole world
But is it worth the girl that you're losin'?
Be careful with me
Yeah, it's not a threat, it's a warnin'
Be careful with me
Yeah, my heart is like a package with a fragile label on it
Be careful with me

[Bridge]
Care for me, care for me
Always said that you'd be there for me, there for me
Boy, you better treat me carefully, carefully, look

[Verse 2]
I was here before all of this
Guess you actin' out now, you got an audience
Tell me where your mind is, drop a pin, what's the coordinates?
You might have a fortune, but you lose me, you still gon' be misfortunate, nigga
Tell me, this lust got you this fucked up in the head
You want some random bitch up in your bed?
She don't even know your middle name, watch her 'cause she might steal your chain
You don't want someone who loves you instead? I guess not though
It's blatant disrespect, you nothin' like the nigga I met
Talk to me crazy and you quick to forget
You even got me trippin', you got me lookin' in the mirror different
Thinkin' I'm flawed because you inconsistent
Between a rock and a hard place, the mud and the dirt
It's gon' hurt me to hate you, but lovin' you's worse
It all stops so abrupt, we started switchin' it up
Teach me to be like you so I can not give a fuck
Free to mess with someone else, I wish these feelings could melt
'Cause you don't care about a thing except your mothafuckin' self
You make me sick, nigga

[Chorus]
The only man, baby, I adore
I gave you everything, what's mine is yours
I want you to live your life of course
But I hope you get what you dyin' for
Be careful with me, do you know what you doin'?
Whose feelings that you're hurtin' and bruisin'?
You gon' gain the whole world
But is it worth the girl that you're losin'?
Be careful with me
Yeah, it's not a threat, it's a warnin'
Be careful with me
Yeah, my heart is like a package with a fragile label on it
Be careful with me

[Verse 1]
Look, my bitches all bad, my niggas all real

Big fat checks, big large bills

Walk in, bulletproof vest
Please tell me who she gon' check
Murder scene, Cardi made a mess
Pop up, guess who, bitch?
Pop up, guess who, bitch?

[Outro]
Press, press, press, press
Press, press, press, press
Press, press, press, press
Pop up, guess who, bitch?
Pop up, guess who, bitch?

[Intro]
M-M-M-Murda

[Chorus: SZA]
Left a nigga on read 'cause I felt like it
Dress me down in that Raf, Saint Laurent jacket
Dapper, dapper, I look fine and my checks divine
No wonder, wonder why I do whatever I like
I do what I like, I do, I do
I do what I like, I do, I do
I do what I like, I do, I do
I do what I like, I do, I do

[Verse 1: Cardi B]
I think us, bad bitches, is a gift from God (Gift from God)
I think you broke hoes need to get a job (Get a job)
Now I'm a boss, I write my own name on the checks (Cardi)
Pussy so good, I say my own name during sex
I might smack a bitch 'cause I felt like it
Gucci shoes and a belt like it
Said that Cardi is his favorite fragrance
I'm a rich bitch and I smell like it
I'm in a boss bitch mood, ayy, these heels are Givenchy, ho
These are some boss bitch shoes
If you ain't no boss bitch, move, ayy
For the record, I set record record sales
I like niggas that been in and outta jail
They said by now that I'll be finished, hard to tell (I can tell)
My little fifteen minutes lasting long as hell, huh?

[Chorus: SZA]
Left a nigga on read 'cause I felt like it
Dress me down in that Raf, Saint Laurent jacket
Dapper, dapper, I look fine and my checks divine
No wonder, wonder why I do whatever I like
I do what I like, I do, I do
I do what I like, I do, I do
I do what I like, I do, I do
I do what I like, I do, I do

[Verse 2: Cardi B]
Look, broke hoes do what they can (Can)
Good girls do what they told (Told)
Bad bitches do what they want (They want)
That's why a bitch is so cold
I'm a gangsta in a dress, I'm a bully in the bed
Only time that I'm a lady's when I lay these hoes to rest
The coupe is roofless, but I get top in it
I'm provocative, it's my prerogative
80K just to know what time is it
Cardi rockin' it, go buy stock in it
Spend what I want, ain't no limit
I say what I want, I ain't never been timid
Only real shit comes out my mouth and only real niggas go in it
Leave his texts on read, leave his balls on blue
Put it on airplane mode so none of those calls come through
Here's a word to my ladies, don't you give these niggas none (Give 'em none)
If they can't make you richer, they can't make you cum (Egh!)

[Chorus: SZA]
I left a nigga on read 'cause I felt like it
Dress me down in that Raf, Saint Laurent jacket
Dapper, dapper, I look fine, and my checks divine
No wonder, wonder why I do whatever I like
I do what I like, I do, I do
I do what I like, I do, I do
I do what I like, I do, I do
I do what I like, I do, I do

[Verse 1: Cardi B]
Look, I just want to break up all your shit, call your mama phone
Let her know that she raised a bitch, then dial tone, click
And fuck your little fake ass friends
Come around actin' like they my bros
I seen y'all little group texts
Where you all like to brag about your hoes
And you can tell your little bitch
I screenshotted all her naked pics
Oh, you wanna send nudes to my man?
Wake up and see your boobs on the 'Gram?
Lil' bitch, I cannot stand you, right hand to Jesus
I might just cut all the tongues out your sneakers
Smash your TV from Best Buy
You gon' turn me into Left Eye
I don't wanna hear 'bout invasion of privacy
I had a feeling, it turns out you lie to me
I'm holdin' back everything that's inside of me
How you out fuckin' with bitches that follow me?

[Pre-Chorus: Ali Tamposi & Cardi B]
My heart is beating like it's bleeding out
You sleepin', you sleepin', you sleepin'
You sleeping like a baby
Everyone was right about you now, and
You creepin', you creepin', you creepin'

[Chorus: Ali Tamposi & Cardi B]
I went through your phone last night
I went through your phone last night
Saw some things I didn't like
I went through your phone last night
It's killin' me, killin' me, killin' me, oh

[Verse 2: Cardi B]
All I can see is you and her in different scenarios
Beyonc' on my stereo, "Resentment" on repeat
I'ma make your bowl of cereal with a teaspoon of bleach
Serve it to you like, "Here you go, nigga, bon app'tit"
Look, did you give it to her raw? You love her or nah?
You risk your whole home for a ho from the bar?
You really want them hoes? You can have them bitches
You don't even cheat with no badder bitches
This shit is eatin' me, you sleepin' peacefully
Gettin' more mad at you, thinkin' 'bout stabbin' you
Don't even know that you this close to dyin'
You gon' wake up like, "Why you got an attitude?"

[Pre-Chorus: Ali Tamposi & Cardi B]
My heart is beating like it's bleeding out
You sleepin', you sleepin', you sleepin'
You sleeping like a baby
Everyone was right about you now, and
You creepin', you creepin', you creepin'

[Chorus: Ali Tamposi & Cardi B]
I went through your phone last night

Saw some things I didn't like

Ooh, ooh

[Chorus: Kehlani]
You don't hit my line no more, oh, oh
You don't make it ring, ring, ring, ring
I can't keep this on the low
I want you to make it ring, ring, ring, ring

[Verse 1: Cardi B]
Should I call first? I can't decide
I want to, but a bitch got pride
The switchin' up shit is what I can't fuck with
I'm feelin' you but you hard to get in touch with
And you ain't hit me up in a while
Actin' like you don't know what number to dial
You quit, then that's it, I'ma throw in the towel
'Cause a nigga only gon' do what you allow
You don't want this gun smoke
Learn to text with your nose if your thumb broke
I don't care if we get into it and I stall on your ass
Better still wake up to missed calls from your ass, nigga

[Chorus: Kehlani]
You don't hit my line no more, oh, oh
You don't make it ring, ring, ring, ring
I can't keep this on the low
I want you to make it ring, ring, ring, ring

[Verse 2: Cardi B]
Nah, nigga now you gon' have to call me (call me)
'Cause I'm lookin' at these messages, they on me (yeah)
Actin' like they ain't niggas that want me
Let another nigga in your spot, and you gon' be hot nigga, coffee
You gon' be sick to your, stomach
Hit me when you free, 1-800
It's emergency, call me 911
Cause right now I'm out here tryna find someone
The ring on my phone, ring on my finger (brrr)
You actin' like you ain't tryna do either (yeah)
Once a good girl, watch me turn diva
Here goes my heart, I put it on speaker (oh)

[Chorus: Kehlani]
You don't hit my line no more, oh, oh
You don't make it ring, ring, ring, ring

[Bridge: Kehlani]
You used to be on my line
On my tick all the time, yeah
Love it when you make me feel
Like you don't mind when I ain't got time for you
And no it don't go to my head, I'm only arrogant in bed
I just love to know you wanna spend time with me instead
Now you all caught up, yeah
You all caught up and you done left me alone, yeah
You was all fed up
Ready for the next step, wanna be on your own
Said I just miss you, I just miss us, baby
All I know is

[Chorus: Kehlani]
You don't hit my line no more, oh, oh
You don't make it ring, ring, ring, ring (you don't make it ring, baby)
I can't keep this on the low (yeah, yeah, oh)
I want you to make it ring, ring, ring, ring

[Verse]
Look, they gave a bitch two options: strippin' or lose
Used to dance in a club right across from my school
I said "dance" not "fuck", don't get it confused
Had to set the record straight 'cause bitches love to assume
Mama couldn't give it to me, had to get it at Sue's
Lord only knows how I got in those shoes
I was covered in dollars, now I'm drippin' in jewels
A bitch play with my money? Might as well spit in my food
Bitches hated my guts, now they swear we was cool
Went from makin' tuna sandwiches to makin' the news
I started speakin' my mind and tripled my views
Real bitch, only thing fake is the boobs
Get money, go hard, you're mothafuckin' right
Never been a fraud in my mothafuckin' life
Get money, go hard, damn fuckin' right
Stunting on these bitches out of mothafuckin' spite
Ain't no runnin' up on me, went from nothin' to glory
I ain't tellin' y'all to do it, I'm just tellin' my story
I don't hang with these bitches 'cause these bitches be corny
And I got enough bras, y'all ain't gotta support me
I went from rag to riches, went from WIC to lit, nigga
Only person in my fam to see six figures
The pressure on your shoulders feel like boulders
When you gotta make sure that everybody straight
Bitches stab you in your back while they smilin' in your face
Talking crazy on your name, trying not to catch a case
I waited my whole life just to shit on niggas
Climbed to the top floor so I can spit on niggas
Said "I was just tryna chill and make bangers" (Bangers)
Tell all these old bitches they in danger (Stop)
The thing on my hip whip bitches into shape (Brrrt)
That's what I call a fuckin' waist trainer
You gon' run up on who and do what? (Who?)
I think y'all got your story screwed up (Yeah)
I came here to ball, is you nuts?
I don't want your punk-ass man, I'm too tough (Facts)
I'm the one that's killin' shit, hands down (Hands down)
If you got a problem with me, say it now (Say it)
'Cause I don't wanna hear no sneak dissin' (Huh?)
'Specially not from one you weak bitches
I'm on go like I don't see no stop lights (Skrrt)
I'm steppin' out every day, prom night (Facts)
So if it's all love, show me love then (Huh?)
'Cause you hatin' on a bitch, that's what it sounds like
Beast mode, that's how I give it up, nigga
Hoodie, low, that's how I'm pullin' up
Just 'cause I been on the road don't mean I been on the run
And you gon' have to learn to hold your tongue or hold the gun (Brrrt, woo)
And we all know you ain't that type (No)
I smack you and the bitch that you act like (Yeah)
I started gettin' money, bitches upset (Cash)
They remind me of my pussy, bitches mad tight
Nails done, hair laid, keep 'em both laced (Laced)
Co-come through shinin' with a Rollie bust face (Shine)
He-headshot, headshot, tell 'em closed case
Ain't no bitch spittin' like this since '08
I don't trust no nigga, I don't fear no bitch (Fear no bitch)
Whole life been through some fucked up shit (Fucked up shit)
They say I'm too that, oh, I'm too this
When you see what I've seen, you end up like this (Woo)
I walked into the label, "Where the check at?" ("Where the check?")
Cardi B on the charts, ain't expect that
Where that bitch that was claimin' she a threat? (Where?)
I'ma put a Louboutin where her neck at
They say I'm too ratchet, they say I act wild (I act wild, wild)
I'm tryna whip the foreign like a bad ass child (Bad ass child, skrrt)
They caught me slippin' once, tell 'em try that now (Try that now)
Cardi B, know it's me, hear that "blap" sound (Blap!)

[Chorus]
Man, I said we gon' win
Knock me down nine times but I get up ten
Look myself in the mirror, I say we gon' win
Knock me down nine times but I get up ten
Look myself in the mirror, I say we gon' win
Knock me down nine times but I get up ten
Yeah, but I get up ten
Knock me down nine times but I get up ten, bitch (woo)

[Bridge]
I'ma make a fuck nigga feel me (yeah)
Said I'ma do a broke bitch filthy (ah)
I'ma make a fuck nigga feel me (grrr)
Said I'ma do a broke bitch filthy (grrr)

[Chorus]
We gon' win
Knock me down nine times but I get up ten (woo)
Yeah, I said we gon' win
Knock me down nine times but I get up ten, bitch (grrr)

[Intro: Chance The Rapper]
I'm livin' my best life, yeah, yeah
I'm livin' my best life
Made a couple M's, you know (IGH! Huh!)

[Chorus: Chance The Rapper]
Said I'm livin' my best life
Said I'm livin' my best life
Made a couple M's with my best friends
Turned all my L's into lessons
You see the whip pullin' up, it's like "skrrt"
Dreams pullin' up, I'm like "skrrt"
I'm livin' my best life
It's my birthday, at least that's what I'm dressed like

[Verse 1: Cardi B]
I'm like Big Pop' mixed with 2Pac, I'm like Makaveli (Yeah)
You need some, Little Caesar's pizza, I be hot and ready (Woo)
Nigga, you a pussy and a rat, you like Tom and Jerry
Nigga, you ain't ballin', you just talkin', that's that commentary (Huh)
I was in the field, man, I slaved for this (Yeah)
Had to talk to God, dropped down, and prayed for this
To my surprise, He replied, said, "You made for this"
I seen the car I wanted, then I went and paid for it, cash cash
Hit the Tay-K, I hit the race, hit the dash dash
That's when they came for me on Twitter with the backlash
"#CardiBIsSoProblematic" is the hashtag
I can't believe they wanna see me lose that bad
They talkin' junk and they stink, these hoes mad trash
I'm gigglin', can't let the devil have the last laugh
Ain't no more beefin', I'm just keepin' to myself
I'm my own competition, I'm competin' with myself (Brrr)

[Chorus: Chance The Rapper]
I told y'all, I'm livin' my best life (Woo)
I told y'all, I said I'm livin' my best life (Ayy)
I made a couple M's with my best friends
Turned all my L's into lessons (Skrrt, skrrt, skrrt)
You see the whip pullin' up, it's like "skrrt" (Like skrrt)
Dreams pullin' up, it's like "skrrt" (Like skrrt)
I'm livin' my best life
It's my birthday, at least that's what I'm dressed like (Chance, I'm The Rapper)

[Verse 2: Chance The Rapper]
You don't like money, I can see it your eye
You don't like winnin', I can see it in your tie
Better be careful with these women when you trickin', send it fly (Sheesh)
She count money in her sleep and she don't ever spend the night
But she trappin' and she had to make it happen for her life
Don't be mad because she havin', shit, you had it your whole life
We had baggage on our flight, we had badges on our asses
You got passes in your life, you had gadgets on your bike
God work magic, God work magic, God work magic in my life (Woo)
And that guala like Iyanla 'cause that bag just fixed my life (Woo, woo)
And y'all know good and damn well I don't want no champagne (Woo)
But can we please get some more champagne? (Ugh)
Please, no Andre, G like 'Venchy
Reach like 'Bron James, pep talk from Yonc'
'Member my hands had ash like Pompeii
Now they hold cash, won't peak like Dante

[Chorus: Chance The Rapper]
I told y'all, I said I'm livin' my best life
I told y'all, I said I'm livin' my best life (Ayy)
I made a couple M's with my best friends
Turned all my L's into lessons (Skrrt, skrrt, skrrt)
You see the whip pullin' up, it's like "skrrt" (Skrrt, skrrt, like skrrt)
Dreams fillin' up, I'm like "skrrt" (Like skrrt)
I'm livin' my best life
It's my birthday, at least that's what I'm dressed like

[Verse 3: Cardi B]
I said I never had a problem showin' y'all the real me
Hair when it's fucked up, crib when it's filthy
Way-before-the-deal me, strip-to-pay-the-bills me
'Fore I fixed my teeth, man, those comments used to kill me
But never did I change, never been ashamed
Never did I switch, story stayed the same
I did this on my own, I made this a lane
Y'all gotta bear with me, I been through some things
Went from small-ass apartments to walkin' red carpets
Pissy elevators, now every dress is tailored
This some real-life fairy tale Binderella shit
I got further than them hoes said I will ever get
And that only goes to show that only God knows
I took pictures with Beyonc', I met Mama Knowles
I'm the rose that came from the concrete and arose
I'm like gold, I'm life goals, man, I'm chosen, I'm floatin', ayy

[Chorus: Chance The Rapper]
I told y'all, I said I'm livin' my best life
I told y'all, I said I'm livin' my best life (Ayy)
I made a couple M's with my best friends
Turned all my L's into lessons (Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey)
You see the whip pullin' up, it's like "skrrt" (Like skrrt)
Dreams pullin' up, I'm like "skrrt" (Like skrrt)
I'm livin' my best life
It's my birthday, at least that's what I'm dressed like

[Outro: Chance The Rapper]
Skrrt skrrt, it's goin' down right now
Skrrt skrrt, Jamie Foxx in your town like
Skrrt skrrt, money pilin' up, man
All the blessings comin' down
You don't know 'bout nothin' (You don't know)
You don't know 'bout nothin' (Ayy)
You don't know 'bout nothin'
You don't know 'bout nothin' (I told y'all, I told y'all)
You don't know 'bout nothin' (I t-, I told y'all, I told y'all)

From across the globe, look, uh

[Verse 1]
Now, I said luxury apartments (Wow)
I'm young and I'm heartless (Yeah)
There's a bitch that ain't my bitch then that bitch is a target (Brrr)
Lawyer is a Jew, he gon' chew up all the charges
Don't matter if you fuck with me, I get money regardless (cash)

[Chorus]
That guap, guap, get some chicken
Guap, guap, get some bread
Guap, guap, get some chicken

[Verse 2]
Now I said, hoes down, Gs up (Gs up)
You know how I'm rockin', but my watch is freezed up (Ice!)
I can't wait until they drop that Lamborghini truck (skrrt!)
I'm careful where I park it, hoes will have it keyed up
Them bitches getting beat up (Brrrat!)
Slim waist, ass fat (fat), my shit is caked up
My bad bitch at the bake (yeah), without no makeup
This that collard greens, cornbread, neck bone, back fat
Get it from my mama and you don't know where your daddy at
Knick-knack, paddywhack, give a dog a bone (Bone)
Put it on him, then your nigga never comin' home (Home)
I'ma flex like a 'roid, I'm a ten, she a 'droid
Stupid ho, unimportant, unattractive, unemployed

[Chorus]
Get some guap, guap, get some chicken

Never by my lonely got my niggas by my side
And all my niggas skrr skrr yeah they down to ride
Yeah my bitches go to work I'm talking 9 to 5
The streets want to fuck around you won't stay alive
Your man can cross you and I make sure that you pay the price
So don't be lacking when you coming home from work at night
You run your mouth I poppin out now it's on sight
You gon' be just like my pussy hella tight
A hoe can hate but don't be fucking with my commas
And if she is I'll shape her up and she gon' get the line up
Can't be starting all these problems if you cannot solve em
Cardi backing down I swear to God that's not an option

[Chorus]
Ran down on that bitch twice

[Verse 2]
Some bitches claim they with the shits but they ain't with a thing
I spin the block come around like a boomerang
Silence silence I don't hear a thing
Worry about me but your pussy smell like turtle tank
I pull up on that check nothing less that's all I do
10 bands 50 bands ain't nothing new
I see some people who still worried about my revenue
I'm eating good you wish you could don't worry about my food
And niggas hating on a female ain't no way to live
You bitch made make me wonder if you got a dick
How you feeling like a man envying a chick
Wake up and go get some money go and find your niche
Silly muthafucka who raised you
A nigga with a pussy how disgraceful
I have my hittas come and duck tape you
And your bitch could get it too double date boo
So let's get it so let's get it so let's get it let's not waste a minute
You clearly started so let's finish
I don't do forgiveness, they take your kindness for a gimmick
I'm just here for business
I'm running down and I'm with it

[Chorus]
Ran down on that bitch twice

[Intro]
Uh, yeah
Some regular degular, bloody bars

[Verse]
I swear to God, they ain't wanna see me leave the club
Got up on my shit and now they scared to show me love
They'd rather see me on the pole twerkin' it for dubs
I guess I really gotta show them what the fuck is up
I'm on some other shit, that Cardi B gutta shit
Every time I catch a hating bitch, she on her stutter shit
Can't finish her words but on Instagram thuggin' shit
You set yourself up, don't make it seem like I be buggin', bitch
And niggas hatin' on me, really be upset
I don't know, make me wonder what you got between your legs
You a real nigga mad at a bitch for getting bread?
You's a bitch from birth, you just grew a third leg, woo!
Bite down, bite down, it was crunch time
Yeah I skip all of them bitches in the lunch line
I put in work, now I'm here at the front line
Ready for the bullshit, I swear it's on my bloodline
Touch mine, getting slumped, slimed one time
Pump blind, bitches quick, then I dump mine
Pull up with the Gucci clutch, spitting clutch rhymes
Flyer than a big big B with a Blood tie
Don't do much, he get hard when I bust wines
No straws for this juice box, gulp one time
Last nigga I was with went insane
'Cause my head game over hills like I'm lookin' for the sunshine
I'm a Bronx bitch birthed from the hip-hop
From the block to the tick tock in the Patek watch
Quick drop with the cash, couldn't fit the Ziploc
Grips locked, get your shit popped in my flip flops
Wealthy now, but every dollar, I still want it all
Now he wanna nail me, I could give your man a cure
You gotta mail me, but I don't check my spam at all
Never feel what you're sayin' like I'm usin' Anbesol
Travel all around the states getting nice checks
I was tourin' off a tape, I had a hype set
Is that the reason all these niggas wanna pipe next?
I'm a creep, bitch, see his dick through his Nike Tech
Got 'em all scared, I ain't even strike yet
Wire up jaws when I swing if the mic stretch
I worked hard, took the right steps, had a shot
So I took the shit, now this game gon' need a life vest

[Outro]
Uh
I said, woo!
Huh

[Intro]

Look at me, look at me
They ain't like me before, now they bookin' me
The glow got bitches so shook at me
They like, "Chef Cardi B, what you cookin' B?"
I say, "Bitches, got me on some new shit"
I swear niggas got me feelin' ruthless
Too much mo'fuckers done doubted me
That's why I had to just prove it
I remember walkin' in the stores, I couldn't buy nothin'
They look at me starin'
Now I just walk in the stores, I like it I cop it
I don't even think
Bank tellers asking for info
'Cause now my deposits on Kimbo
Told that bitch, "Gimme my money
Why the fuck you askin' all this info?"

[Pre-Chorus]
Run up, get done up
Got shooters ready for a come up
Promise you I didn't luck up

[Verse 2]
See me in my 'bach, now they all surprised
Now they call my phone, I just press decline
Not even six seconds, I don't give 'em Vine
Tell 'em, "Fall back," all must recline
Bitches mad as fuck but I don't give a fuck
Niggas can't believe it, better soak it up
Lookin' like I caught a lick, bitch
Your nigga got me on his wishlist
Thought I was makin' no moves?
Thought I was gon' be livin' in Sues?
Thought I was makin' no money?
You fuckin' thought I was gon' lose
Everythin' I did, I swear I got paid
Been 'bout my money, that ain't gon' change
Bitch, you gon' drown tryna ride on my wave
Corny ass bitches, I just can't relate

[Pre-Chorus]
Run up, get done up
Got shooters ready for a come up
Promise you I didn't luck up
Was grindin' all night
Didn't sleep 'til the sun up

Walk around like I'm that bitch
Every nigga wanna hit

Run up on me, you get hit
And all my bitches with the shits

Why is it so hard to fall in love
Why don't you ask me
Why can I never ever ever try
Why don't you ask me
Why everything is going this way
Why don't you ask me

They say the one that you truly love hurts you the most
Now the one that I truly love hurt me the most
Now the one that you truly love is hurting you the most
I guess I'll never know
Why I got so cold
It's not your fault

[Outro: Cardi B & Josh X]
Be selfish, be selfish, be selfish Withering away as I gaze at the sky looking at his face and all the pain it's caused me
I ask why
Didn't I love
Didn't I give you more than I ever gave myself
What do you wish cause that part of me no longer exist
This time I'm first, I'm picking me
I finally learned to be selfish

[Verse 1]

[Pre-Chorus]
I can't believe it

You got no luck, man
And how you niggas even let them in the crib with that?
You know that weave stink, that shit need a Tic Tac

Probably leave with ya man, grand larceny
Bitch, pardon me, you don't wanna start with me

Keep it litty for my city, NYC
Take the whole nut, ain't worried 'bout no Plan B
Yeah, I'm nasty, lick my lips, blow a kiss
And walk off with a hunnid thou' on my wrist
Swish, I ain't with the politics
"A hoe never gets cold," you know what the motto is
Unless it's baguettes diamond cuts, gold bottles, bitch
Sittin' in that 6, frostbite, feelin' hella lit

[Hook]
Hectic, hectic
When I pull up it gets hectic, hectic
Don't worry 'bout what's on my left wrist, it cost a check, bitch
If I'm in the spot, I'm slayin' shit, I'm in the best fit
Hectic, hectic
When I pull up it gets hectic, hectic
Don't worry 'bout what's on my left wrist, it cost a check, bitch

[Verse 2]
NY, do or die, yeah I got this

And I'm a freak so you know that bitch topless
You a hot mess, that's a fact though
Understood the life, bitch, you know how that go
A lot of thots out here plottin' on my cash flow
But I'm a queen just tryna build the castle
You a fiend, you all up in my asshole
I cause a scene and give you what you ask for
Hair did, manicure, so ready, check
Attitude have to be so petty, yep
I'm in it this year, a minute to spare, I swear
My vision is clear, y'all bitches beware, I'm here
Showstopper, Ms. Life of the party, yeah
Top shotta, no filter, Young Cardi, yeah

[Hook]

[Intro]
I'm your...

[Verse 1]
Yo, I'm Cardi B with the wicked flow
Ask them, I keep them niggas on their tippy toes
Nick-nack-paddy-wack, give a dog a bone
Got him runnin' home, fuck him good, get that money flow
Pussy got him goin' places he would never go
Pussy got him cookin', now he wanna clean the stove
Pussy got him fucked up, I think he overdosed
But I ain't Travis Scott, I ain't got no antidote
Antidote, antidote

[Hook]
I think I like that
I think I like that
I think I like that
I think I like that

[Verse 2]
Yo, some people know me as a stripper hoe
But stripper hoes get the money and blow digits though
A lot of bitches talkin' down on me like I'm a joke
Talk shit, I'll fuck your man, send him back hella broke
I'm laughin', but I really mean it though
I'm on another level like I'm playin' Mario
These bitches can't see me, even with a telescope
Every day I'm shittin' on 'em, I don't flush the toilet bowl
Ew! Cause I be workin' and workin'
All these heads I be turnin', they on my body like surgeons
I think they see my conversion
That's why they be lurkin', but their feelings be hurtin'
Or remember when I wanna dance at certain clubs
And they told me, "No, no, that's a dub"
Now they the same niggas blowin' up my phone
Wantin' me to host, oh word? That's a dub
Bands

[Hook]
I think I like that
(I know, I know they're mad now)
I think I like that
I think I like that
(Hurtin' my feelings)
I think I like that

[Verse 3]
When I come up in the building I initiate
I'm the reason why the fuckers gotta renovate
I'm eatin' good and they mad they can't get a plate
Never thought we'd be gettin' booked in different states
Before the century they didn't even look this way
Now they wanna eat my ass like a skirt steak
Got 'em sending gifts, it's not even my birthday
You niggas soft and I meant that in the worst way
Oh you bitches suckin' dick just to get a bag
You hustlin'-backwards ass bitch, you're doin' bad
It's pretty sad, you should be getting more than that
Suck a dick so you can pay your rent, couple months with that
I mention flow, keep it on the low, I tell you facts
When a nigga 'bout to cum, just throw it back
It's over, you won, that nigga trapped
And that bank account, girl? Empty that

[Intro]
Oh, how you doin'?
I'm alright
Hahaha

[Verse]
Now how much times do I gotta prove these niggas wrong?
And how much times I gotta show these bitches I ain't soft?
How many shows I gotta sell out 'fore you get the cost?
Why they really tryna front like I ain't hit the charts?
All these labels, throwin' deals from left to right
But I ain't givin' in until they get them numbers right
All these people think that this shit happen overnight
All that flexin' they be doin', shit is all a hype
No tolerance for a hatin' bitch talkin' shit
Only time I hold my tongue is when I'm suckin' dick
So when I see you in the streets, yeah, it's fuckin' lit
And don't be talkin' all that sorry shit, don't flip the script
I see the lights, I hear the hype, I hit the mic
I kill the show, I get my dough, I catch a flight
I see a hater, I'm runnin' down, it's on sight
I throw my hands, I hit em' left, I hit em' right
They sleepin' on me just because I used to strip
But it's all good 'cause now they wanna get up in my VIP
Blowin' up my phone, sayin' everythin' I touch is lit
Actin' corn and wanna fuck me like they wasn't talkin' shit, woah
I let 'em live, let the shady motherfuckers live
Get them the price then it's time to show them what it is
Don't got the bat? Well then what you really tryna pitch?
Don't waste my time, I ain't never been no average bitch
Not to mention, I did my tour and that shit was winnin'
Independent, the headline, award of feelin'
I thank the Lord for all the blessings that he is given
I love the fans, they fill me up with their ammunition
I don't really talk shit but now I gotta off this
I don't know why bitches think we work in the same office
Corny bitches tryna keep up? Look exhausted
Wave the white flag, girl, you might as well just forfeit
My ex told me I was never gon' be shit
Lookie, lookie now, lookie now, nigga I'm that bitch
What you thought? Yeah, you really lost, now you kinda sick
But I ain't never need a nigga, I was always on my shit, yeah
I used to stare at magazines on the train
Lookin' at these models like, "I gotta be this one day"
Fuck around, got myself a name, now I'm gettin' paid
Left the corny bitches in the grave, so they throwin' shade

[Hook]
Hundred band, hundred band
I'm 'bout my bread I got to get this shmoney man
They fuck with my shmoney I'm sending them shots I watch them do the running man
I'm with the shits if a nigga want this he gon' have to buy all of that

Pussy got him on the jugg he gonna re-up and come right back

[Verse 1]
No I'm not cool, 'cause bitch I'm bool

Run up on me got mechanics with tools
And they ain't scared to lose
They had me on snooze
Now when I host it's is a zoo
When the host is a zoo
Got me a check I got a check
Feeling so blessed
Doing a lot more than what they expect
I'm in my prime everything in effect

He want to dab in this pussy but I don't think he get the picture

I'm talking that ice, just ignore the price or I might just dismiss ya
Don't do broke niggas, ain't no joke nigga 'cause the pussy delicious
Bitches mad at me cause I'm on my shit
I know they doubted me cause I used to strip
Blew on IG on some regular shit, then she to TV on some degular shit

Bitch try me I promise you get it

Gotta watch all these faces there's too many counterfeits
Sometimes when you hear them say I got you you can't even count on it

I need to make sure you remember me forever
I have to show you

[Verse 2]
Hi there
My name is, my name is
Cardi, Cardi, Cardi, Cardi

Lonelyness
It fulfills my sorrow
You may think
You may think I have no tomorrow
Its easier to die
Than to live
But I will show you
That I'm strong enough
To use you and abuse you
And I'm gonna live
And I'm gonna win (haha)
I'm gonna win
I'm gonna win
I'm gonna win
I'm gonna win
I'm gonna win
I-I-I-I-I'm go-onna win

[Chorus]
I want to hurt you
I got to make sure that you feel me
I need to make sure they remember me forever

[Intro: Cardi B]
Them motherfuckers be like, "But what type of niggas will wife you?"
My type of niggas will wife me! The type of niggas that like bitches that pop off and suck dick all day motherfuckin' long, bitch
Thanks to all my followers that always defended me, y'all like my god brothers and god sisters. I would dead jump in your fight, I would dead jump in your fight. Now what's poppin?

[Hook: Cardi B]

[Verse 1: Cardi B]
I'm startin' to lose my patience, weak bitches hatin'
Bitches throwing subs like I won't kick your face in
Baby mama's mad 'cause I'm in first place, and
When it comes to you bitch, there's no conversation
I been to give it up grimy, I'm the Bronx bitch, I'm feisty
"Cardi why you feisty?" Shut up bitch, fight me
NY raised and so you know it's very likely
That when I hear some shit that I don't like, I get hype B
Who would wanna wife me? Your nigga wanna wife me
You think 'cause I'm a stripper hoe, that nigga won't think twice B?
Put this pussy on his face, rde that shit nicely
Set his ass up, then you really ain't gon' like me
So what you tryna do? You and you and you
I feel some type a way, a bitch finna get loose
Tell me what's the deal? I'm 'bout to start the hill
The wig is comin' off, shit 'bout to get real

[Hook: Cardi B]
Who wanna pop off?
Who wanna start war?
They talkin' shit?
I'm takin' tops off

[Verse 2: Casanova]
Got beef with Cardi B? I'm poppin' off
Shit get hectic? I'ma drop it off
Oh you shinin'? Your chain and your watch is off
You was never with this shit, nigga, knock it off
Youse a pussy, and your whole block is soft
You caught feelings, could she ain't even drop you off
You thought that bag was gettin' you pussy, not at all
You was gettin' lied, you ain't know she made that call
To the dog's dinner, and they starvin'
I gotta feed all 'em
I'maget that nigga, you gon' get that bitch
What they thought switched 'cause we both got rich?
Nah, we on the same time
You got yours, I got mine
You got a problem, get in line
It's Cardi B, and 2 times

[Hook: Cardi B]
Who wanna pop off?

[Verse 3: Cardi B]
Shit, that bitch six three and she bodied
Superman calves, and her shoulder somethin' retarded
I ain't backin' down, Cardi got the heart regardless
You gon' have to knock me out if you think I'ma forfeit
Gang gang, squad up, and have my niggas all on it
Pay a couple niggas and they had you out in a coffin
And I put that on my life, I really don't do this often
But the way I'm feelin' now, like whatever, I'm on it
Have you laid out on the stretcher with your socks off
Had the pastor prayin', like, "Sorry for your, loss"
Throw dirt on my name, you better pop off
My name ring bells like Mayweather, box off
I'm Cardi B, east coast newest contender
5'3" lookin' good with the nails bananas
Freddy Kruger on these bitches, I cut their lights off
Should have read the memo, Cardi B pops off

[Intro]
Gangsta !
Cardi !
B !

[Chorus]
This is how I do
I make a fool out these bitches
They be thinking they tough
This is how I do
I make these niggas spend their money
Then I show them no love
This is how I do
If the bag not involved
Then you know it's a dub
This is how I do
They ain't fuck with me before now I gotta stunt

[Verse 1]
Pull up like huh?
They looking like what?
Heads turn left and right, they wonder who's her?
Cardi B, duh
Bitch don't front
You on my Gram all day, don't play dumb
Came up from the slums
The dirty, dirty Bronx
Where niggas quick to clip your shit, no fair ones
You gotta keep a gun, but beef to me is fun
I never back down, been this way since day one

[Pre-Chorus]
They shit on me before, thought I was just a stupid hoe
They tight now, they realize they was sleeping on gold
Took me one year man, and now I'm doin' shows
Now they wanna take pics with me, hold on let me pose
Believe me, I easily can do a bitch greasy
I'll give it to you just how you like it girlll
Cardi B in full effect, couple bitches upset
Couple niggas wanna hit it and they can't so they stressed

[Chorus]
This is how I do
I make a fool out these bitches
They be thinking they tough
This is how I do
I make these niggas spend their money
Then I show them no love
This is how I do
If the bag not involved
Then you know it's a dub
This is how I do
They ain't fuck with me before now I gotta stunt

[Verse 2]
Cardi in tune, bitches make room
Test me? The gat goes CLICK, CLACK, BOOM
Gangsta Bitch, oooh, Volume 2
Cop somethin' mean, when it start you hear that VROOM
Pull up to your side, 30 deep right?
Stuntin' on my ex, he thirsty for a reply
Sick, sick, sick
Call my phone, it's CLICK
Had me fucked up when you was fucking with that bitch

[Pre-Chorus]
Making power moves
Goin' 50 on 'em
Same ones that played me
High-siddity on 'em
Back to back with it, goin' Drizzy on 'em
Now they tight, they gotta watch me make a milli on 'em

[Outro]
Ha-Ha !
Yo, yo, Remember, remember nigga when you told me that I was gonna work in that strip club Divas on 177th in the Bronx for the rest of my life? Well guess what nigga? Now i'm the fucking diva
Shit
Fuck outta here
GANGSTA!

Lyrics from snippet

[Chorus]
Stylin' on these hoes, I'm stylin' on these hoes
I be stylin' on these hoes, I'm stylin' on these hoes
[?] wrist full of gold

Grind up a check, got it at the store
Runnin' through the checks till the club close
Stylin' on these niggas, stylin' on these hoes
I be stylin' on these bitches, stylin' on these hoes

[Verse 1]
I gotta get it, I need the chicken, I need the bread
That's why I'm workin' and I'm in the Benz 'cause you in the bed
Bitches is sleepin', fuck is they thinkin'? What is you doin'?
Then they be mad, lookin' at me like I did something to 'em, uh
Bank account on racks, pussy still on drip drop
Put this pussy on wax, took me straight to the tip top
I might race with the Wraith, ain't no space in the safe
Next bitch in my face catchin' case, catchin' case
But anywho, anywho, Birkin bag, Jimmy Choos
All my bitches say "Eeeeooowwww!", all my guns go "Boom!"
More guns than the warden, smack hoes with my Jordans
Pussy's floodin' New Orleans, kiss a bitch and I'm gorgeous
Never been no pussy, yo, I'm always with the shits
I ain't never been no dirty broad but now I'm filthy rich, bitch bitch!

[Chorus]
Stylin' on these hoes, I'm stylin' on these hoes
I be stylin' on these hoes, I'm stylin' on these hoes

[Verse 2]
Money, money, money, money's all I think of
I swear to God, I wake up and get the green stuff
You put your money on these hoes, get your refund
I just got my nails did, I just got my weave done
If you want a fly press put Bardi on that shit
I just bought a new gun, put a body on that shit
She upstairs, I'ma wait in the lobby for that bitch
I got my bitch and a man that can buy me all that shit
You can find my fine ass
Bathtub with a wine glass
All these hoes wanna bring me down
I don't never ever mind that
Can you show me where your money is?
'Cause I know where mine's at
All the energy you put in me
You just tryna get the top back
Lately I been on some conceited shit
'Cause I don't need a bitch
Blast off, I don't feed a bitch
That's how I treat a bitch
In my hood I got hella stripes
Straight Adidas shit
Hope she got the same energy
When I see that bitch, bitch!

[Chorus]
Stylin' on these hoes, I'm stylin' on these hoes
I be stylin' on these hoes, I'm stylin' on these hoes
[?] wrist full of gold

Rollin', rollin'
All my bitches rollin' and I love that shit
Them commas comin' quick

[Verse 1]
Look, show you bitches how to do this shit
Stand back while I demonstrate
Pussy worth like a million dollars
I think your nigga got expensive taste
I'm not a bum bitch, I'm a boss bitch
You sideline, I'm center stage
I don't even get involved with it
If it don't make me cum or it don't get me paid
If it's not the money then it's "poof, be gone"
Steal your man with my Doobie on
Whole team full of bad bitches
And that Louis Vuitton our uniform
24 karat my grills, I do what I want
Bitch, fuck how you feel
Fuck a whole check up all on my nails
I pull up in foreign and cut in my wheel, byes, bitch

[Hook]
Rollin', rollin', all my bitches rollin'
All my bitches rollin', rollin', rollin'
All my bitches rollin' and I love that shit
Them commas comin' quick

Rollin', rollin'
All my bitches rollin' and I love that shit
Them commas comin' quick

[Verse 2]
Look, I'm not a rider chick, I'm a driver chick
I could come get you instead
I hope all of your homies got money, nigga
'Cause all of my bitches got bread
Look, got a home girl out the west coast
Swear to God, I love that bitch
Ask about us, any club
They gon' tell you we run that shit
I'm like the strip club, Mariah Carey
Dominican, Halle Berry
Hair be laid, bills be paid
Still put bread on my nigga commissary
If I want somethin', it's, "Whatever, cop it"
Balenciaga, tell 'em check the closet
Heard you fuckin' for that extra change
That's why that pussy got that extra mileage, I be rollin'

[Hook]
Rollin', rollin', all my bitches rollin'
All my bitches rollin', rollin', rollin'
All my bitches rollin' and I love that shit

All my bitches rollin' and I love that shit
Them commas comin' quick
Rollin', rollin', all my bitches rollin'
Rollin', rollin'
All my bitches rollin' and I love that shit

[Intro]
You know, people underestimated me
And making me feel like I'm never gonna amount to shit because I used to be a stripper
It feels like I'm getting whipped in the back, with words
But you know what?
They don't see the bigger picture
I had to feed myself, I had to feed my family
But you know what?
Just here me out

[Verse 1]
Lord forgive me for my sins
Forgive me for the crazy shit I wish I never did
I'm simply just a young hood girl tryna win
I just want it all, and I gon' pretend
Like I ain't never had to suck a dick to pay my rent
I'm tryna get my family out the hood and new cribs
I wanna finish paying my mothers new whip
I do it for a cause, so understand the kid
I want my little girl to go to school in Fort Lee
Schools in the hood, got him crazy, man he three
And it's fucked that it ain't how it's supposed to be
He should be counting 123's and ABC's
And momma used to beat my ass like every week
That's because she can't have nothing but love for me
I wanna spoil her so much, oh lord please
That's my everything
My everything, my family

[Hook]
You know what?
Even when I was stripping, like bitches was worried 'bout the wrong things
Oh they want red bottoms, they want the biggest cars
Like I'm worried 'bout my father stop cab driving
Before he turn sixty, and my mom stop being a cashier before she fifty like
That's why I'm working so hard out here
That's why I go so hard
Not for me, but for them though
You feel me?

[Verse 2]
Note to self, for my sister Hennessy
Try and go to school, finish up and get degrees
Don't be fucking trick niggas, just so you can eat
That's the shit I did and it really makes me weak
I would close my eyes, dying for it to be over
The thought of a stranger inside, I just can't be sober
Dirty ass breath, breathing all over my shoulders
Ain't no bitch gon' tell you that, just respect the soldier
And I wanna tell my dad, you don't gotta cab
Drive for two whole weeks just to make a stack
You don't gotta drive no more, I'm gon' change all that
I put that on my everything, I'm gon' pray for that

[Outro]
You know when I was a little girl I used to tell my mom
"Hey mom, when I grow up, I'm gonna buy you a house, I'm gonna buy you a car"
Until I turned eighteen, it's like damn, I can't even get me my own apartment
So, it's just like, now that I'm in this position I'm gonna
I'm gonna take full advantage of it
Like oh my gosh, I can't wait till I get to surprise my mom
Like, "Hey, I didn't went to college, but look, look at me mom, look at me now, look, look mom, look, look at your house, This is your house! Not mines, but yours, and I bough it for you!"

[Hook]
They out here looking for revenge
All day, all night
See me not once but twice
All looks and no fights
See me doing me got em wondering how a bitch came a took flight
They talk about me all night
God damn they must be tight
They looking for revenge

[Verse 1]
Yeah, it's not my fault tho
I swear I just do me and bitches be sick, bitches got sore throats
Last year I was on the pole
Now you can catch ya girl on the road
Damn near 15k a show
I think some bitches need to know, yeah
Cause I don't brag much
But shit really be a blow
When I got bitches that's coming for me like we on the same level, that's a no
These bitches is nowhere near my level
Can't even fit em in my schedule
Yeah your girl is overbooked
You really think my attention's gonna catch you
Mixtape been out for 3 weeks
And already charting on Billboards
For really think that shit was free
All I gotta say is "thank you Lord"
This is for the ones that was doubting me
And said I was never gon be shit
All of a sudden they proud of me
And wanna be hopping on my dick
They six, six, six
Yeah, sick, sick, sick, cause they know wassup
I'm usually always humble but right now I really don't give a fuck
Some niggas be hating hard
Why is it because you didn't buck?
Cause you didn't get the time a day?
And I left ya lame ass in the dust
Oh man, oh man
If you hittas pulling straight fam on
They saying I'm the next superstar
Co-signed by Lee Daniels
Im just tryna play this game clever
I'm just tryna do that shit right
So I hit em wit that "Foreva"
Ran down on that bitch twice

[Hook]
They out here looking for revenge
All day, all night
See me not once but twice
All looks and no fights
See me doing me got em wondering how a bitch came a took flight
They talk about me all night
God damn they must be tight
They looking for revenge

[Cardi B]
Know I don't really brag much, but bitches better stop fucking playing with me like I can't stunt on a bitch
Like, like y'all think, y'all think I'm playing with my pussy all day long or something
You know what, bring that back
Mm

[Verse 2]
I know some bitches in the Bronx that wanna be me a little
But stop on learning how to suck and fuck and live free a little
And bitch know your worth, don't show it all, let em see a little
And if he ain't bout the money, hit the brakes, but do speed a little
I remember having no money, sleeping at my ex house
My mom couldn't take me at the time, so she had to kick me out
But I'm not mad at her one bit, cause I don't think I would've took this route
I had to go get it on my own
Im just glad I figured it out
Like I been through a lot
And it wasn't easy to escape
That's why it really bothers me when motherfuckers got something to say
And just to set the record straight
[?] to stop a J
If they ain't SwiftOnDemand, then they ain't help me in no way
I swear they be wanting so much credit
But don't wanna give none when it's due
Slept on ya girl for so long
Now wanna come hopping out the blue
Nah bruh shit don't work like that
Well at least it don't in my book
Cause if you fuck with me hard, and I fuck with you, then there's no other way to look
Imma hit em again and again
Get so much music, it go to ya friend
Hitting a tour and the shade gon end
Hmm that's why they looking for revenge

[Intro]
Oh, this the one right here, Wicked?
Okay
Yeah, yeah
Run that back, Turbo

[Chorus]
We started off as close friends (Close friends)
Somehow you turned into my girlfriend (My girlfriend)
We used to tell each other everything (Everything)
I even went and bought her diamond rings, matching earrings
Everything was so cool (So cool)
Lately baby been actin' so rude (Been so rude)
I don't know what somebody told you (What they told you)
But I ain't gon' lie, I miss the old you

[Verse 1]
I know you remember how I would hold you
Still remember how I approached you
I think I loved you 'fore I knew you
Know we be fuckin' 'fore I screwed you
Made a promise I won't use you
Play my cards right, I won't lose you
Got 'em tuned in like I'm YouTube
Got somethin' on me like it's voodoo
I'll go nuts for you, go cuckoo, lose my cool and all
And I know that shit was wrong, I shouldn't've did what I did

[Verse 2]
Just wipe your eyes and stop this cryin'
I told the truth, that I'd been lyin'
I gave you racks, I tried to buy in
I even did the unthinkable, and I'm sorry for what I did to you
Take me back, if I was you and I did what I did
I probably would, I probably wouldn't
Take you back, if I was you and I did what I did
I probably would, I probably wouldn't
Just wipe your eyes and stop this cryin'
I told the truth, that I'd been lyin'
I gave you racks, I tried to buy in
I even did the unthinkable, and I'm sorry for what I did to you

[Chorus]
We started off as close friends (Close friends)
Somehow you turned into my girlfriend (My girlfriend)
We used to tell each other everything (Everything)

Everything was so cool (So cool)
Lately baby been actin' so rude (Been so rude)
I don't know what somebody told you (What they told you)
But I ain't gon' lie, I miss the old you

[Verse 3]
Keep our business to ourselves
The internet ain't doin' no help
I know I shouldn't've never left
But everything I did for us
And us, I'm speakin' on my kids
Thinkin' 'bout this shit I did
Like how the hell I get myself involved in this bullshit?
Married to the game, I can't make you my fianc'e
Bad young boss bitch, treat her like Beyonc'
But damn what them broads say, I fucked them all the first day
And that's why you trippin' anyway, like when I fuck 'em I don't pay
Even if we never speak again
I'll make sure you're ridin' in the latest Benz
Keep your business all apart if you can stay out of mine
Bought a brand new Audemars, but I done ran out of time

[Chorus]
We started off as close friends (Close friends)
Somehow you turned into my girlfriend (My girlfriend)
We used to tell each other everything (Everything)
I even went and bought her diamond rings, matching earrings

DaVinci
Yeah
Shot a ho, I'll go see him, I ain't no tired ho, 4PF
Know what I'm saying? It's time to put this up
Yeah

[Verse]
Shoutout my label, that's me
I'm in this bitch with TB
I'm in this bitch with 4 Trey
I just poured up me an eight
Real nigga all in my face
Five hundred racks in my safe
Five hundred racks to the plug
What you know 'bout showin' love?
What you know 'bout pullin' up in Bentley trucks?
Make these bitches fall in love
All of my niggas on go
None of my niggas no hoes
All of my niggas want smoke
All of my niggas together
We came from the bottom, we used to wear each other's clothes
None of my niggas gon' fold
Couple pussy niggas told
They ain't my niggas no more
Hold it down for the four
In the nine with the woes
Marlo my dawg, that's for sure
We won't fall out about shit
Specially not 'bout no bitch
We ain't gone fall out 'bout hoes
Me and Ced get them loads
We let 'em go for the low
I got my hood in control
I got my left wrist on froze
I got my right wrist on froze
I got my necklace on froze
Both of my ears on froze
I been gettin' faded, I'm sippin' on maple
If she won't fuck, I won't make her
I don't like bitches with makeup
If she want titties, I pay for 'em
Get outta there when I wake up
I pass the ball, I don't layup
I'm a big boss, I got say so
They'll wipe you down if I say so
Dracos, on Dracos, on Dracos, on Dracos
.40's, on .40's, on .40's
I just bought me some new water
Wetter than Katrina, shoutout New Orleans
I made a promise my niggas gon' ball
Hard in the paint, change my name to John Wall
Geekin' off trees like a leaf in the fall
Find a new plug then we takin' em all
Pull up in a brand new Benz truck
Hop out fresher than a menthol
Lil nigga, but I'm big dawg
All I gotta make is one call
Hit a nigga block, took off
Cross a nigga up, Hot Sauce
Ooh, I got 'em mad, my fault
Talkin' 'bout the shit that I bought
Poppin' these Percs, I done turned to a savage
Hundred racks stuffed in the mattress
Hundred racks stuffed in the attic
Hundred racks stuffed in the sofa
These niggas play gangster, but they won't approach me
I know they'll never approach me
They know that they'll catch a bullet
I rock the gang to the fullest
I run with some real ones, I don't hang with no pussies
I ain't no killer, don't push me
I see how you niggas be lookin'
I hope you don't think you no bully
I'm livin' the life, I should star in a movie
Ridin' in a Vert with an Uzi
12 get behind me, I lose 'em
They tryin' guess what I'm doin'
They tryin' guess who I'm screwin'
That ain't even they business
They ain't wanna fuck with me
Now they see a nigga drippin'
Now they wanna fuck with me
They can't get in touch with me
Hardly ever in the city
They just know I'm gettin' bigger
They just know a nigga busy
I been runnin' up them digits

Yeah

Hundred thousand dollars on my neck

They gon' wait in line for this drip
I'ma give her mine, then dip
I'ma try to kill her for the real
Thirty thousand dollars in my ear
I ain't gotta sign no deal
Made a half a mil' last year
I just came home from the can
20 days, whole hundred bands
Got a nigga feelin' like the man
All these bitches knowin' who I am
Hit the ground runnin', I ain't playin'
Put a hundred bricks in the van
Give a thousand pounds to my man
Blow the money fast as I can
Signed to the streets, no advance
Bitches tryna rip me out my pants
'Cause they heard a youngin' gettin' bands
They don't know that I ain't goin' for nothin'
Only gave the bitch a couple hundred
Big dawg, nigga, you a runner
Run off on the plug, change my number
Drop top coupes for the summer

[Chorus]
Yeah, that's my dawg for sure (My dawg)
Yeah, that's my dawg (My dawg)
Yeah, that's my dawg for sure (My dawg)

I'm on my way, I'm goin' fast

[Outro]

As soon as I get there, I'ma put her in a full nelson

[Verse 1]
Bought her brand new shoes, told her kick rocks

Think red means go so I don't stop
I know they wish they could catch me, but keep wishin'
You think I done turned into a fiend for these bitches
Tryna stuff as much as I can in these britches
Made your bitch fuck on my friend, it's no difference
I ain't never popped no Xan, I sip sizzurp
If I ever have to tell on the gang, I won't do it
If I put it on a song, I seen it or been through it
I can't put it in my song, I know how the feds move
Scream free all of the ahks but I ain't no FamGoon
Gave my mama ten bands, sent her to Canc'n
Got the crowd goin' dumb but I ain't no damn fool
If I went in there and did it and made it, you can too
We done came a long way from broke and sharing shoes

[Chorus]
When your wrist like this, you don't check the forecast

Just left the dealership, no tag
If we opposite, it won't work, it won't last
Get an opposite knocked off, toe tag
Ain't been home in a month, got my ho mad
They need me in the trap but I can't go back
I jumped off the porch with a hundred dollar slab
I got M's in the bank, give a damn what they think
Every vibe I ever shot my shot at, caught it
Everything you ever seen me riding in, bought it
Big dawg status, I ain't gotta sell drugs
Put my craft into rap then I took off, yeah

She said she love me but I know the truth, she been fuckin' my dawg (my dawg and all)
Lately I been feelin' crazy so I ain't been answerin' calls

Straight to the money no stop

Free all of my niggas sittin' in the cell blocks

Condo at the top floor
We was so high, you can ask God
You can ask God

[Verse 1]
I know they hate it, I see they faces, they mad I made it
I'm on they ass, I'm gettin' this bag, I ran it up fast
Stand up in they chest no apology
Mama sent a text that she proud of me
Youngins in the hood watchin' out for me
Money all colors like Monopoly
Park the Jeep, hop in the Vet
Stay on they ass, stay on they neck
Keep me a check
Viper came yellow, I painted it red
And I paid cash, you heard what I said
Goin' crazy, I been feelin' the rage
Last year I was sittin' in the cage
This year I'm goin' all the way
Taking drugs, tryna ease the pain
I see 'em watchin'
They on my drip, they tryna follow the wave
They on my page
They know that I'm paid, ain't been in town in days
Most of these niggas they old news
All these bitches been ran through
I'ma save all the fifties and keep the hundreds
Then spend all the dubs on getting money
Straight from the 'jects to a jet
We been gettin' real fly
Free G-Five, on a G5
Balmain denim, no Levis
Strapped to a T, who want war with us
Dually sit up like an armored truck
I brought it out, it's a one of one
Nigga screaming gang, they ain't one of us

[Chorus]
Toast to 'em all
She said she love me but I know the truth, she been fuckin' my dawg (my dawg and all)

I'ma go straight to the top
Free all of my niggas sittin' in the cell blocks
I'ma give it all I got
I'ma go straight to the stars
Condo at the top floor
We was so high, you can ask God
You can ask God

[Verse 2]
Draped down in Gucci, she rock Givenchy, she matchin' my fly
I know it's wrong, but fuck if it's wrong, I don't wanna be right
Let's take a trip, if we leave now, we can land tonight
We gon' take a trip to Dubai, guarantee you won't see nobody
Nobody safe where I come from
Young niggas goin' straight dumb
Fifty hollow tips in each drum
Throwing fours up with lil one
Hoppin' out trucks, we suited up, we ready for war, yeah
Yeah that's my boy, that's really my dawg
We went from boys to men

[Outro]
Straight to the money no stop
I'ma give it all I got

I can't be fuckin' these hoes raw, I had to slip on a rubber (Slip in that)
I can't be rockin' no plain jane, both of my watches be flooded
I can't be drinkin' on regular soda, all of my cups be muddy

Here go the bricks, where the money at?
Give me a load, I ain't comin' back
I make 'em shoot where your stomach at
We gon' pull up where your mama at
Runnin' through hoes like a running back
We can fuck but you can't call this number back
If you knew better, baby you'd do better

I can't be drinkin' on regular soda, all of my cups be muddy

[Verse 2: Moneybagg Yo]
If I said fuck you I meant that
I'm whippin' this coupe, I ain't rent that
The shit that you savin', I spent that
And if you want smoke you can get that
I just want proof of the backend
Any time I fuck her I hit from the back end
I'm pullin' her hair while I dig in her
She like hold up baby, keep my tracts in
I can't hit that bitch raw, got a glove on me
I'm in the trap with the drugs on me
I just went bonkers all up, Exclusive Game
Fly as fuck like a dove on me
Diamonds wet like a tub on me
Hurricane Harvey, flood on me
Left the spot with a dub on me
Walk in the spot, bitches tug on me

[Chorus: Moneybagg Yo & Lil Baby]
I can't be totin' no handguns
Unless that bitch come with a thirty
I can't be fuckin' these dog hoes
Unless that bitch come with a buddy

That bitch gotta come with a button
I was broke like a while back
Now I'm up all of a sudden
I can't be rappin' for free, they gotta send me the budget

When you with your maggot ass friends, don't discuss me
FN with extended clip, I hope them try to rush me
I hear 'em sayin' such and such, a nigga ain't gon' touch me
Big body Benz, 'member I used to be dusty
Now I want my money all hundreds in a rush please
I was sellin' weed when they came out with White T
Now I put a whole half a ticket on my white tee
Whole hood poppin', other niggas, they don't like me
Made her eat it up, she told her friend, "He gon' wife me"
All my niggas thoroughbred, I don't fuck with crossbreeds
Free all of the bros down the road and on Rice Street

In that fast thing, speedin' through the city (Skrrt, skrrt)

Money conversations, check my feng shui

Cars up to date, brand new Wraith
My life circle, mines ain't straight
Bills ain't late, paid no notes
I ain't no joke, they want smoke
We exotic, start a riot, we gon' ride
.223's, drakes outside
We don't get tired, we gon' die

[Verse 1: Lil Baby]
Youngin from the project fucked around and got it poppin
I'm like fuck a Maserati, bought my bitch a Bentley truck

And me, I got Chanel swag, you know I be C'd up
I paid cash for every car, used be the laughing stock
Kept it real, that's why I don't flock
Look at me, I'm on the chart
I don't look down but I'm on top
I don't entertain any clout
Play with me, you gon' get shot for real
Now they can't resist us, hear 'em tryna diss us
Really need to miss us, prolly with your bitch, bruh
I bought her purse off a piece of my endorsement
Richer than my classmates, she know how my kids taste
Now I'm on this cash race, I can't come in last place
I done finally went legit, accountants, I'm a taxpayer
So you know that mean I'm goin' hard 'til my last day
Still can get a thousand pounds a week, the gas way

[Chorus: Lil Baby]
I got six watches, I'm ahead of time
I'm goin' all out if it's 'bout mine
I'm gettin' my shine on, I been on my grind
Feel like I'm different, I'm one of a kind
Buy her a Birkin Bag, keep her up to par
Baby, you look better naked, you should take it off
Had to play my role, now I'm takin' charge
Just got off parole, made the brodie take the charge

[Verse 2: Meek Mill]
Bendin' through in that Phantom with them sticks, yeah (Skrrt, skrrt)
All these blues, niggas asking am I Crip yet? (Cuzzo)

And we don't do them lil' planes, we on the big jet (Big jet)
My dawg still movin' that 'caine, and he ain't quit yet (He ain't quit yet)

Feel like I'm the chosen one (Woah)
Rolls truck, I ordered one (Woah)
I ain't mean to buy that bitch a watch, but I bought her one (Ah)
Richard Millie cost a quarter milli', I got more than one (Yeah)
FN on me lighter than a bitch, feel like a water gun (Gang)

[Chorus: Lil Baby]
I got six watches, I'm ahead of time

[Verse 3: Lil Baby]
Livin' like a pornstar

Opps finna join us but we ain't switching sides
Neck look like a freezer, ain't savin' no skeezer
They gave me a reason, now they gotta die
I don't want no smoke with you if you don't want no smoke with me
But dawg if you want smoke with me, we switchin' shifts, sleep and creep
I did what they couldn't do, guess that's why they mad at me
But what's up with yo vibe, dawg, why she keep on addin' me?
This my strategy
Keep on stackin' Gs, make 'em proud of me
I went Prada Tees, I went Prada jeans
I want Prada fleece, I'm from poverty
Real talk

[Chorus: Lil Baby]
I got six watches, I'm ahead of time
I'm goin' all out if it's 'bout mine
I'm gettin' my shine on, I been on my grind
Feel like I'm different, I'm one of a kind
Buy her a Birkin Bag, keep her up to par
Baby, you look better naked, you should take it off
Had to play my role, now I'm takin' charge
Just got off parole, made the brodie take the charge

[Verse 1]
Draped in designer I'm sticky as hell
Whenever we argue I buy her Chanel
Whenever I ain't rappin' I'm sellin' this bail
My nigga got caught, I just hope he don't tell
If you can sit quiet then I'll pay your bail
They not gon' snitch if they send me to hell
I put in overtime to get these M's
Been with the same gang since I was lil'

My vision was blurry and now I see clear
You wouldn't believe what I made in a year
Draped in designer, I'm sticky as hell
I run Atlanta, I should be the mayor

[Verse 2]
You won't believe what I made in a year
I'm flippin' these bags, I made me a mill
Then I start rappin' and got me a deal
I took off fast, this shit get for real
She want to talk but she don't want to hear
All she want me to do is keep it real
She keep on cryin' I'm tired of her tears
I keep on lyin' it just what it is
I'm on my grind, so fuck how you feel
I got some homies who sittin' in the pen
Yeah, yeah
They gon' be sittin' in that bitch for some years
We were some teens, they labeled us grown
Had some judges who doin' us wrong
I know your pain just hold on
Just sing this song

[Chorus]
I can do bad on my own and good by myself
I never needed no help
I needed you niggas, you wasn't right there
You need me, lil' nigga, I'm still gon' be here
My vision was blurry and now I see clear
You wouldn't believe what I made in a year
Draped in designer, I'm sticky as hell
I run Atlanta, I should be the mayor
I can do bad on my own and good by myself
I never needed no help
I needed you niggas, you wasn't right there
You need me, lil' nigga, I'm still gon' be here
My vision was blurry and now I see clear
You wouldn't believe what I made in a year
Draped in designer, I'm sticky as hell
I run Atlanta, I should be the mayor

All-Star weekend, I was gettin' the pack in

Cook that shit up, Quay
4 Pockets Full, nigga

[Chorus]
Is you mad?
'Cause I'm getting cash
That ain't my place
Bought a new Wraith
She in my face
I want her head
I want her legs
I want a redhead
I want her head
I want her neck
I want her legs
You don't even beg
We can fuck on the floor
We can fuck in the shower
Leave your friends at the door
Tell 'em give you a hour

[Verse 1]
And they know I'ma GOAT
I got paper and power
Man, these niggas some hoes
Everything they say sour
I bought a Bentley and blew out her brain
Since I got money and people done changed
I'm keepin' my .40, I'm up on my aim
Jump out of line, I bust at your brain
Shoebox money, it ain't nothin' to me
I could make a hunnid in my sleep
These niggas cappin', that's all they see
They just wanna be like me
Takin' this swag and then give it back
I didn't get mad, I went and got more
They just wanna be like him
I don't wanna be like them
Used to wanna be like him
'Til I stayed down and ran up an M
Baby ballin', they should put it on film
Shootin' for bricks, I don't aim for the rim
Fuck the gym, I don't work out
Take a sip of the lean, wash the Perc down
I got on all my jewels, foreign, and all my shoes
These niggas mad 'cause I won't lose
I gotta win, I just began
No fake love, no fake friends
Just 30 in this FN

[Chorus]
Is you mad?
'Cause I'm getting cash
That ain't my place
Bought a new Wraith
She in my face
I want her head
I want her legs
I want a redhead
I want her head
I want her neck
I want her legs
You don't even beg
We can fuck on the floor
We can fuck in the shower
Hey, your friends at the door
Tell 'em give you an hour

[Verse 2]
I go deep in her throat
Keep that shit on the low
Don't nobody else know
That's our business fasho
We can fuck on the counter
I keep takin' these downers
Pop me a Addi, a Percocet, pour me a four
Baby, we grown, we could fuck on the floor
I'm gettin' money
That's why they mad
That ain't my fault
Nigga, I'm a boss
Get white chalked
Playin' with an OG
I got bags
These niggas owe me, they know me
Standin' in the kitchen and workin' my wrists
I made a duece, turned to a nick
I make a nick, turned to a nine
I made  a nine, turned to a split
You know the rest, I made a split, turned to a brick
We in this bitch, we got it lit
We got them sticks

[Chorus]
Is you mad?
'Cause I'm getting cash
That ain't my place
Bought a new Wraith
She in my face
I want her head
I want her legs
I want a redhead
I want her head
I want her neck
I want her legs
You don't even beg
We can fuck on the floor
We can fuck in the shower
Leave your friends at the door
Tell 'em give you an hour

[Chorus]
Fifty-five hunnit for a new pair of titties, I'll buy 'em like Jordans
Give her a couple of thousand, now she feelin' important
Dick her down, she'll be gone by the morning
She got them ass shots that I like
Pop a Addy, we'll be fuckin' all night
She say she got a man but it's alright, shoot outta town, first class flight
Fifty-five hunnit for a new pair of titties, I'll buy 'em like Jordans

She say she got a man but it's alright, shoot outta town, first class flight

[Verse 1]
You can be mine and I can be yours
Let's have a baby and name it Dior
Ain't got no time I'm always on tour
I pressed decline I always ignore
I had to tease her so she can want more
Baby we grown we can fuck on the floor
Condo top floor, we gon' make love on the balcony
She want that dick tryna tackle me
I'm gettin' money like I was a athlete
Wake her up and put her back to sleep
I let the homie hit after me
She got super head he enjoying that
I ain't cuffing no bitch I ain't doing that
Once I hit it one time I ain't goin' back
I'm out the door like a floor mat
She say she diggin' my format
I'm the baby I'm a rug rat
She like, "Damn baby where my hug at?" I'm like, "Damn, baby, we don't do that"
Gave her a couple of thousand for the pussy
Get in there let her know I ain't no rookie
Put on a show like somebody else lookin'
Diggin in her deep make her push me

[Chorus]

She say she got a man but it's alright, shoot outta town, first class flight

[Verse 2]
She say she tied up, she got a man and he on her ass
She say she tired of 'em
Give her a perkie, a pack of backwoods and tell her to fire up
Top floor penthouse suit, baby, we high up
Who said that you cannot buy love?
We gon' be making love until the morning, baby, I'm tellin' you, this is your warning
I'm not gon' stop it, I'ma keep on flowin'
Adderall got a nigga goin'
I'ma get it cracking and you know it
I'ma make you happy, I ain't boring
You can tell your friends you don't know me
I'ma beat it up like you owe me
I gotta go, sorry you can't hold me
Fishtail the Vette like it's stolen
Baby you was lucky that I choose you
Fuck all that talkin', baby, I'ma show you
Put a lot of lean in my soda
Coffee cup but this ain't folger's
I know I be drippin' from my toe up
Just don't tell 'em nothing that I told you

[Chorus]
Fifty-five hunnit for a new pair of titties, I'll buy 'em like Jordans

[Intro]
Cook that shit up, Quay

[Verse 1: Lil Baby]
I had to spread my wings, jump out my nest
Ran out of Act so I'm pourin' up red
I took the harder way like I'm Derez
Shout out the doctor keep givin' these meds
I got the streets in a lock like some dreads
Ride on the back of that bitch like some pegs
Runnin' this shit, they should cut off my legs
Had to play a little smarter, I'm using my head
Dropped out of school, took the street way instead
I'm a lil' dope boy, I want me some bread
I'ma shoot at your body, won't aim for your neck
I just cashed out on a flooded Patek
It ain't a big one, but dammit, it's big enough
I just came home from the can, I'ma live it up
I rep the gang, when you see me, I'ma throw it up
I just spent three hundred racks on a Bentley truck

[Chorus: Lil Baby]
Screamin' out, "gang, gang, gang, gang, gang"
I do this shit for the gang
I didn't get in this for fame
Nigga ain't takin' my chain
I'ma stand firm with my name
They say you get money, you change
I got the money and stayed the same
I'm tryna stay in my lane

[Verse 2: Lil Baby & Gunna]
Gotta maintain, can't go back broke
Gotta stand tall, won't bend or fold
Drop top 'Vette, tryna keep it in a Rolls
Ain't signin' no deal, ain't sellin' my soul
Gotta run it up fast, my mama gettin' old
I'm a million dollar nigga, gotta reach my goal
Got the hood on my back, still throwin' up fours
They say the Act gettin' low, I'm still pourin' up fours
I pour the six if it cost me
I like to fuck on your ho on the balcony
I got the cheese and I got me some broccolli
All color money, this shit like monopoly
Can't get this drip, ain't no need for you watchin' me
I ran my racks up and I moved out of poverty
I'm keepin' designer all over my body
I got some Buscemi, I got new Givenchy
Damn I thought I'd never see the day
I'm so glad I made it through the rain
They don't wanna see a nigga straight
They don't wanna see young Gunna paid
Take a long time, I had to wait
Want this penthouse, a lot of space
A lot of hundreds comin' our way
Bust it down, split it with the gang

[Chorus: Lil Baby]
Screamin' out, "gang, gang, gang, gang, gang"
I do this shit for the gang
I didn't get in this for fame
Nigga ain't takin' my chain
I'ma stand firm with my name
They say you get money, you change
I got the money and stayed the same
I'm tryna stay in my lane

[Verse 3: Lil Baby]
I used to sleep on the floor for a mattress
Getting evicted, that shit was embarrassing
My mama didn't have it, we made us a palettes
I had to share with the roaches and rats
Keep gettin' money these voices keep telling me
I went to prison, it made me a better me
I can't get no job, I got too many felonies
I been on probation since I was like seventeen
I done got me some stripes in the hood like a referee
I used to walk into school with that fire on me
I'm gettin' money, ain't really got time to beef
I don't know why these lil bitches be lyin' on me
I'm the jungle forreal where them lions be
I'm goin' apeshit, they callin' me Willie B
These niggas be sayin' they gon' rob me but we'll see
I'm gon' make every nigga with 'em fear me

[Chorus: Lil Baby]
Screamin' out, "gang, gang, gang, gang, gang"
I do this shit for the gang
I didn't get in this for fame
Nigga ain't takin' my chain
I'ma stand firm with my name
They say you get money, you change
I got the money and stayed the same
I'm tryna stay in my lane

[Outro: Lil Baby]
Run it all up and stay the same, yeah
I'ma run it all up and stay the same
Run it all up and stay the same, yeah
I'ma run it all up and stay the same
I will not change for shit, I got my name from this
I will not change for shit, I got my name from this
I will not change for shit, I got my name from this
I will not change for shit, I got my name from this
Run it all up and stay the same, yeah
I'ma run it all up and stay the same

[Intro]
We global now

[Chorus]
Bought her baby Gucci strollers (Strollers)
Switch it up and I went global (Global)
Can't play around, I had to grow up (Grow up)
Check out my neck, hell of a glo-up (Glo-up)
These niggas cap and that shit blow up
My dawg rappin', hope he blow up
I need my checks without no hold-ups
I put my city on my shoulders
I told the truth in every story that I told 'em
I fucked around and showed 'em

[Verse 1]
All of my whips got that new car smell
Don't get it twisted, from the 'partments, I just park well
I don't fuck with him, that nigga flawed, send him to voicemail
Catch up with him, push up on him, tell him how we all feel
Made myself a millionaire, only took a year, dawg
Thinkin' bout what I been through, I can make a tear fall
Late night with them youngins, we was creepin', could've killed y'all
We ain't gon' do that internet beefin', that's for bitches, dawg
I went up to space so they hatin', they can't lift off
I can make your bitch eat my kids, every drip drop
I come from trenches, we can't come outside in flip flops
I done came so far, sittin' on the floor, watchin' the tip-off

[Chorus]
Bought her baby Gucci strollers (Strollers)
Switch it up and I went global (Global)
Can't play around, I had to grow up (Grow up)
Check out my neck, hell of a glo-up (Glo-up)
These niggas cap and that shit blow up
My dawg rappin', hope he blow up
I need my checks without no hold-ups
I put my city on my shoulders
I told the truth in every story that I told 'em
I fucked around and showed 'em

[Verse 2]
I put my all into this shit
I worked so hard to get my wrist
It broke my heart but I didn't quit
I had to ball with no assist
I got 'em all on my drip
Go with his move, he gon' get flipped (Yeah)
I had to hustle for a meal, yeah
And now I'm hustling in these M's, yeah
Gave Jock and Dee 200 years
Whenever they call, I let 'em hear
Them lawyers I got gon' lift they spirit
Them niggas know I keep it real, yeah
Sometimes I feel like the floor is giving in on me
I work so hard but I can't stop 'cause they depend on me
I tried to holler, she didn't talk, but now her friend want me
I see through all, and my life flawed, need no lens on us

[Chorus]
Bought her baby Gucci strollers (Strollers)
Switch it up and I went global (Global)
Can't play around, I had to grow up (Grow up)
Check out my neck, hell of a glo-up (Glo-up)

[Intro]
Cook that shit up, Quay
I know they ain't feelin' my pain
I got codeine inside my veins, yeah

[Chorus]
I don't know who gassed you niggas up, go get a refill
We got them sticks, we in the field, we playing defense
He got his ratchet, no life jacket, ready to dive in
Lil homie thuggin', he can't even swim, he in the deep end

[Verse 1]
They offerin' the shooter the death penalty, won't tell on me
I know if I go broke today, them same hoes gon' bail on me
I got them throwin' salt, they steady tryna fuck up my recipe
Amiri jeans, a hundred a pair, ain't nothin' about a nigga cheap
Sellin' weed in the projects, relapsed on the Hi-Tech
Told the gang that we up next, put 'em on a G5 jet
Overseas with my sidepiece, my queen, she gotta be a dimepiece
We gon' stick together like assigned seats, on that Dej Loaf, nigga, try me
Whoever thought I'd put a hundred on my neck?
Whoever thought that I'd say I'm the one up next?
Whoever thought they'd ever consider me the best?
Whoever thought, whoever thought, whoever thought?

[Chorus]
I don't know who gassed you niggas up, go get a refill
We got them sticks, we in the field, we playing defense
He got his ratchet, no life jacket, ready to dive in
Lil homie thuggin', he can't even swim, he in the deep end

[Verse 2]
Go and ask about me in the streets, they heard of me
If she find out I been creepin', she gon' murder me
I ain't trippin', no complaints, I got my currency up
Out of town, I let the windows down so they can see us
I take the hitters around the globe, that's all I know (That's all I know)
I met her last night she tried to give me her soul (Give me her soul)
I got 'em hatin', they throwin' shots, they on their toes
One thing they know (One thing they know)
One thing they know (One thing they know)
Ain't gon let up on them niggas, once you try us, ain't gon' stop
If it's pressure, let me know, so we can pull up with them Glocks
Tryna dodge the bullshit and tryna make it to the top
If I never sell a record I'ma make it on the block
How you gon wait 'til I make it then try to help me? Nigga I don't need you (No help)
I put the food on the table, nigga was hungry, I tried to feed you
Treat all my niggas like bosses, nobody better, everyone equal (Yeah)
Real talk this the sequel, hold it down for my people

[Chorus]
I don't know who gassed you niggas up, go get a refill
We got them sticks, we in the field, we playing defense
He got his ratchet, no life jacket, ready to dive in
Lil homie thuggin', he can't even swim, he in the deep end
I don't know who gassed you niggas up, go get a refill
We got them sticks, we in the field, we playing defense
He got his ratchet, no life jacket, ready to dive in
Lil homie thuggin', he can't even swim, he in the deep end

[Intro]
Cook that shit up, Quay
Still poppin' Percocet
Drankin' lean too
Shit I gotta deal with

[Chorus]
Caught a few cases, I been on the road but overall a nigga still free
I done been robbed I know how it feel, a nigga gon' have to come kill me
I been through it all, I came this far how a nigga not gon' feel me
Ain't no facade, no cap in my raps everything that I say is the real me
I give all my problems to God
Let him handle all my enemies
I get on my knees and beg him please I just hoping that he hearin' me
I came too far to stop now, I can't let a nigga get ahead of me
I came too far to stop now, I can't let a nigga get the best of me

[Verse 1]
Remember that shoot out we had that time we thought a kid died
Only thing I know when we pulled up, everybody hopped out firin'
I remember on the way back, everybody in the car quiet
I'm just knowing everybody thinkin' we just pulled a homicide, homicide
See me on the news at the spot
Tryna see who they say got shot
I'm the first one stood up, told my brothers y'all all I got
Know if somebody seen us they gon' talk
Phone ringin' I thought it was a thottie
Thinkin' damn, "we just caught a body"
Hopin' everybody keep it solid
Fuck the nigga, I'm thinkin' bout the kid
The nigga shouldn't did what he did
I'm just glad a nigga still here for all the stupid shit that we did
Gotta be here for my kid, gotta watch my son get big
Everything I say is no lie, I'm just glad the kid didn't die

[Chorus]
Caught a few cases, I been on the road but overall a nigga still free
I done been robbed I know how it feel, a nigga gon' have to come kill me
I been through it all, I came this far how a nigga not gon' feel me
Ain't no facade, no cap in my raps everything that I say is the real me
I give all my problems to God

I came too far to stop now, I can't let a nigga get ahead of me
I came too far to stop now, I can't let a nigga get the best of me

[Verse 2]
All I see is young niggas on Instagram with them sticks
I never post no gun, but when it's smoke I bet I send a blitz
That bullshit that you on thinkin' cool get you a 100 years
I bet yo partner fuck yo bitch, I bet you don't hear nothin' from the clique
I ain't gon' tell you no lie, this shit'll make a grown man cry
Folks give yo ass that time, you'll never see the outside
All you do is think and wonder why
Kiss the good life goodbye
Now you gotta fight to survive, ain't no guns all you got is knives
Hear a nigga sharpen 'em at night
Young niggas gone on the ice
Grown men fucking grown men they'll never tell you that part
Buy a phone you gotta have a spot
Everyday a nigga get knocked
Search team turn to the narcs, man this shit can really get hard

[Chorus]
Caught a few cases, I been on the road but overall a nigga still free
I done been robbed I know how it feel, a nigga gon' have to come kill me
I been through it all, I came this far how a nigga not gon' feel me
Ain't no facade, no cap in my raps everything that I say is the real me

I came too far to stop now, I can't let a nigga get ahead of me
I came too far to stop now, I can't let a nigga get the best of me

[Chorus]
Baby why you trippin', I be right here for you

Anything that you want I will provide that for you
I provide that for you
You know I got bitches, never put none 'em before you
Never put them before you
I get you everything that you want
All I ask that you don't blow my phone up

[Verse 1]
Baby I'm in love, I admit it
I know that you think I want to hit it
But baby I ain't got time for no visits
But baby when I get some time we gon' kick it
Baby we gon' live it all the way up
Just stay down for me, I'm on my way up
Them other bitches already done changed up
Baby is you real or you gon' change up?
Fuckin' with a nigga like me dangerous
Would you still be here if I got banged up?
Man I been through that before, they changed up
Now they be like why he actin' famous?
Baby would you ride for a nigga?
Get on top and do the job for a nigga?
If I need you to run to a nigga (would you run?)
Baby tell me you gon' run to a nigga (you better run)
If you need me I'ma come for you baby (here I come, here I come)
I'ma be right there
If you need me I'ma come to you baby (here I come, here I come)

Baby why you trippin', I ain't got time for that

Told you pull up, you trip, never minding that
I ain't never answer that, I'm twine with that
You say that you gone well then I'm fine with that
I will never trip, I'm never calling back
I can never fall in love with you no more
I done gave you all of that

[Chorus]
Baby why you trippin', I be right here for you

Anything that you want I will provide that for you

Baby I be busy, I be tied up
You ain't gotta love me, just don't lie though
We gon' take them trips 'cause ain't nobody else as fly as us
Baby we gon' let 'em have it
We go where they can't go
Pimpin', where'd my cane go?
I'm the same lil nigga, I ain't changed though
They get salty when I pulled up in that Range Rover
Yeah, yeah

[Chorus]
Baby why you trippin', I be right here for you
I be right here for you
Anything you needin', I provide that for you
I provide that for you
You know I got hoes, I never put none 'em before you
Never put none 'em before you
Baby you my world and I swear I adore you
And I swear I adore you

[Verse 3]
Late nights, call on the phone
You say where I'm at, I'm on the way
Two hours later you be callin'
Thought you told me you was on the way
Tell you I got caught up, I got busy
But I had another bitch with
Still when I get it there you gon' get it
Soon as I pull up she gon' get it

[Outro]
I ain't got no time for these bitches 'cause I'm on my grind
Baby are you trippin', I been on my grind (I'm grindin')
4PF, you digg?

[Intro]
Cook that shit up, Quay

[Chorus]
I can't fuck with shawty, know she'll tell
Slim shit, look like Draya Michele
I been goin' crazy, givin' 'em hell
She ain't tryna go with me, I'ma pay her
I crush a lot, baby girl, I'm a player
Connect the dots then I plug up the scale
If we get caught, they gon' give me the chair
Fuck the law, make 'em earn what they pay 'em

[Verse 1]
Ain't no back and forth with no bitches, this ain't tennis
Rolls Royce truck, bitch, it ain't rented
And they braggin' 'bout bitches, I promise we hit 'em
I flooded my wrist, let the bros split a million
At this point I'm heartless I ain't got no feelings
Buy every building in the hood for my children
Like a Drake song, got your vibe feelin' groovy
With no phone, we can make us a movie
I ain't in my bag, I still got my feet out
If we wanted smoke with y'all, you couldn't be out
Free the bros, buy my shit off the kiosk
I'm at the vibe with the spot, this the creep house
Lil' shawty suck it like she just took her teeth out
Five percent tint on the whip, you can't see out
Ready to set it off, Queen Latifah
These niggas talk like bitches, see what they be 'bout

[Chorus]
I can't fuck with shawty, know she'll tell
Slim shit, look like Draya Michele
I been goin' crazy, givin' 'em hell
She ain't tryna go with me, I'ma pay her
I crush a lot, baby girl, I'm a player
Connect the dots then I plug up the scale
If we get caught, they gon' give me the chair
Fuck the law, make 'em earn what they pay 'em

[Verse 2]
Ain't no complaining, money coming in
Put it all up, do it all again
First you get a mil', then it's times ten
Youngest out the crew, AMG Benz
Stand up like a man, take it on the chin
They got consequences in this life of sin
Laugh about it, go in Gucci, spend a ten
When you come home, we gon' all win
Go in any club and make it thunderstorm, this shit reckless
He gon' knock you off with his Rollie on
Drive the Rolls Royce like a hotbox, really came from nothin'
Only ride with my security because I can't be armed
Can't get caught with another gun
They gon' know me when I'm gone
They hear my pain inside my songs
It's like a switch, I cut it on
Pills kick in, gettin' in my zone
Do my job, ain't see no wrong
I'm never talkin' on them phones
Feds gon' try to do us wrong
Man, they got my nigga Long
Lately I just been alone
My cup, my strap, this microphone
Nobody know what's goin on
Just glad I made it off the road
Granddaddy showed me life is a gamble
Ever since I been on them dice
They gon' suck it up like a bowl of rice
I'ma give it to them niggas every time

[Chorus]
I can't fuck with shawty, know she'll tell
Slim shit, look like Draya Michele
I been goin' crazy, givin' 'em hell
She ain't tryna go with me, I'ma pay her
I crush a lot, baby girl, I'm a player
Connect the dots then I plug up the scale
If we get caught, they gon' give me the chair
Fuck the law, make 'em earn what they pay 'em

[Intro]
Who made this beat?
Twysted Genius, baby

[Chorus: Lil Baby]
If I sell my soul, I'll take it back, I'm slime forever (Gimme that)
I put bust down on the whole gang, we gon' shine together
She got Rollies on her timepiece when she step out, she be flashin'
Whenever we get alone, I give her half and she get nasty
My jeans is special edition, Amiri send me these pants
And now everybody be tough, is he gangster or he just actin'?
Ain't got no card, don't do no fraud, seem like all of my bitches plastic
Know you niggas don't want smoke, let's see who run it up the fastest
Keep that fire when I'm cold, I can't let them catch me lackin'
I don't know if they think I'm sweet because I'm rappin'
But fuck 'em, we get active (Get active)

[Verse 1: Lil Baby]
Wrap it, make sure they can't smell it
Drive too far? Don't matter, I'll mail it
Tryna steal swag, I see it, I smell it
Used to get mad, probably beat up my celly
Now I sell bags every day in my city
Ain't doin' no playin', when they come, be ready
I got murder on my mind like that lil' nigga Melly (Free Melly)
Big boy rocks, stud the same size as Nelly (Ten karats)
Long as I live, I'ma get this cheddar
Ever since the bitch left, doin' lil' better
Which car I'ma drive? It depends on the weather
Rolls Royce truck pull up like, "Hello"
Pretty, tall, light skin, shake like Jell-O
If the bitch actin' bougie, I'ma take her to the ghetto
If I ain't smokin' Runtz, then it's probably Limoncello
You got a lil' boy, but you not on my level
Sell P's every day in the hood on my schedule
Young nigga give a ho whole groove like Stella
Jam don't shake like that, that's Jell-O
Made a whole M on the road, then lay low
I'm a real boss in my hood, I got say-so
I was havin' choppas 'fore I heard about Dracos
Put me in the casket with a bust down halo, yeah

[Chorus: Lil Baby]
If I sell my soul, I'll take it back, I'm slime forever (Give me that)
I put bust down on the whole gang, we gon' shine together
She got Rollies on her timepiece when she step by, she be flashin'
Whenever we get alone, I give her half and she get nasty
My jeans is special edition, Amiri send me these pants
And now everybody be tough, is he gangster or he just actin'?
Ain't got no card, don't do no fraud, seem like all of my bitches plastic
Know you niggas don't want smoke, let's see who run it up the fastest
Keep that fire when I'm cold, I can't let them catch me lackin'
I don't know if they think I'm sweet because I'm rappin'
But fuck 'em, we get active

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
Suav' (Huh), sippin' promethazine latte (Yeah)
Sticky-ass weed like Scotch tape (Yeah)
Big B's, call me Banye (Hoo)
Me and Lil Baby compadre (Yeah)
What these niggas talkin' 'bout? Blas' (Huh)
Diamonds on me, that's pav' (Huh)
So bright, can't see, that's a blind date (Huh)
Marley and Fee trynna get high weight (Ooh)
I got M-O-L-L-Y weight
Only once the drugs are done
I feel like, "Where the hell is my grave?"
Heartbeat beatin' at a high rate
World stop spinnin', start to vibrate
It's a cold world, so my house in Miami still came with a fireplace
Pupils dilate, don't judge me
I'm with a sex slave, she like rough D
I got a text straight from the plug, he said "There's a drought"
I said "Funny", now we laughin'
And only time that we act, is when we act asses
Nigga, we active
So if you 'bout that life, get out that casket

[Chorus: Lil Baby & Lil Wayne, Both]
If I sell my soul, I'll take it back, I'm slime forever (Ooh, give me that)
I put bust down on the whole gang, we gon' shine together (Yeah, yeah)
She got Rollies on her timepiece when she step by, she be flashin'
Whenever we get alone, I give her half and she get nasty
My jeans is special edition, Amiri send me these pants
And now everybody be tough, is he gangster or he just actin'?
Ain't got no card, don't do no fraud, seem like all of my bitches plastic
Know you niggas don't want smoke, let's see who run it up the fastest
Keep that fire when I'm cold, I can't let them catch me lackin'
I don't know if they think I'm sweet because I'm rappin'
But fuck 'em, we get active

[Outro: Lil Wayne]
Yeah, fuck 'em we get active, yeah
We can get active, yeah
This still got some active, yeah
Fuck 'em we get active, uh
Fuck 'em we get active

[Intro]
Cook that shit up, Quay

[Chorus: Lil Baby]
I'm getting paid
Cartier glasses they sit on my face
I ain't throwin' shade
I'm getting money, I ain't in the way
I stay out the way
Free all my dogs till they get out the cage
I'm having my way
Running through hundreds and millions a day
They know not to play
Yeah I'm the one you can see on my face
A mil in my safe
Everywhere I go I'm keepin' a K
I'm getting paid
Cartier glasses they sit on my face
I ain't throwin' shade
I'm getting money, I ain't in the way

[Verse 1: Lil Baby]
We just been balling like Odell
I got your hoe on my coattail
She in her feeling but oh well
We got em packs from wholesale
Running through thots in the hotel
Give 'em couple of hundreds for toe nails
Only time I'm in crowed, they both tell
They can say it was vacuum sealed with no smell
I was sitting in jail with no bail
I was sitting in prison getting no mail
My nigga switching up on me I don't care
They got jack shit on him he won't tell
ZO6 Vette, ridin' the fast lane, hope I don't wreck
I'm on that red
Pourin it up with most disrespect
Forgiato on my cars now
I been fuckin 'round with the stars now
5 stars for my lineup
Give these niggas a chance but they time us
Switch the hustle, I did get the grind up
In the spot hundred dollars the lineup
Only big homie niggas can line us
Stickin dick in this bitch cause she fine as fuck

[Chorus: Lil Baby]
I'm getting paid
Cartier glasses they sit on my face
I ain't throwin' shade
I'm getting money, I ain't in the way
I stay out the way
Free all my dogs till they get out the cage
I'm having my way
Running through hundreds and millions a day
They know not to play
Yeah I'm the one you can see on my face
A mil in my safe
Everywhere I go I'm keepin' a K
I'm getting paid
Cartier glasses they sit on my face
I ain't throwin' shade
I'm getting money, I ain't in the way

[Verse 2: Gunna]
I can't stop the money keep calling
VVS' on my collar
'Caught a body trying to dead dock ya
The way she suck she a head doctor
Diggin in I got her legs lockin
Super trendy got Chanel stockings
I ain't never had to fantasize it
YSL we come and change the climate
Run with twenty thousand one out of Onyx
Swear the ring, the chain, watch, Avianne
I got shooters in the trunk right behind me
I got spots like a cheetah won't find me
Gunna Gunna fell in love with these diamonds
Pressure god only rocking the finest
I done told you the crew is almighty
Several time I just gotta remind you
If you my dog I gotta ride with you
I got you dog on whatever the issue
Free my dogs out of prison I miss you
Fuck the laws and whoever against you
Know the plug I don't go through the middle
Showing love it could all be so simple
I'm a giant remember I used to be little
Getting paid, I don't need no credentials

[Chorus: Lil Baby]
I'm getting paid
Cartier glasses they sit on my face
I ain't throwin' shade
I'm getting money, I ain't in the way

[Intro]
Earl on the beat

[Chorus]
I'm only getting in where I fit in
This is a two-seater you cannot sit in
I got a dub in the rear end
I got caught when I fucked her friend
Say I wouldn't do it and did it again
I got some dogs who want me to win
Went to the lot and bought a new Benz
I hit the gas I'm gone with the wind
I'm only getting in where I fit in
This is a two-seater you cannot sit in
I got a dub in the rear end
I got caught when I fucked her friend
Say I wouldn't do it and did it again
I got some dogs who want me to win
Went to the lot and bought a new Benz
I hit the gas I'm gone with the wind

[Verse 1]
I had a carbon I was fifteen
We tryna steal and rob everything
I can't even talk about what I seen
I'm never telling the laws a thing
Made it out alive, can't even lie that shit was awesome nigga
Shootouts I ain't had no bullets I had to call some niggas
Lost lil Juan in the middle of the summer, that shit was awful nigga
As soon as we found out some witness who tell us who did it, we gon' off them nigga
Had to cut off a couple niggas I thought was with me, tried to cross a nigga
These niggas think they can just come and kick shit in my city, it's gon' cost them niggas
Jumped in the game and went got me some millions, no cap
I made a wave for us
Them bitches weren't fucking with me when I didn't have no money, now they can't wait to fuck
Every one of my lil buddies mama know we thuggin', that's why they pray for us
I was in the back of the Bach like Rosa Parks
Me and my dogs on Tec, a four or more
Grind every day like it ain't no tomorrow
I was just broke, ain't going back
I'ma run mines up to the max
I want the cheese, ain't fuckin' with rats
I wanna fuck her I give her a rack
If she don't give me head ain't texting her back
I'm a dog I go deep in the cat
Remember one time I ain't have jack
I had a hunnid I bought me a pack
I took the pack and went got me a bag
It started rolling and coming in fast
I had the old heads hanging back
Now I'm rich now and that's why they mad

[Chorus]
I'm only getting in where I fit in
This is a two-seater you cannot sit in
I got a dub in the rear end
I got caught when I fucked her friend
Say I wouldn't do it and did it again
I got some dogs who want me to win
Went to the lot and bought a new Benz
I hit the gas I'm gone with the wind
I'm only getting in where I fit in
This is a two-seater you cannot sit in
I got a dub in the rear end
I got caught when I fucked her friend
Say I wouldn't do it and did it again
I got some dogs who want me to win
Went to the lot and bought a new Benz
I hit the gas I'm gone with the wind

[Verse 2]
Putting on for the hood like I'm White Boy Marco or something
Super fast car, super bad broad, everybody know a nigga getting money
Couple homies switched up on me when I blowed up now I look at them funny
I put the four on my back with no shirt on
I let the homies get bags for the low low
We sending bricks out the spot this the o-zone
I'm the man, rest in peace Shawty Lo
I take the whole gang on the road
Long way from in front of the store
They don't wanna fly they wanna hit the road
They wanna take pistols to all of my shows
We thuggin' in public wherever we go
I did some shit that don't nobody know

[Chorus]
I'm only getting in where I fit in
This is a two-seater you cannot sit in
I got a dub in the rear end
I got caught when I fucked her friend
Say I wouldn't do it and did it again
I got some dogs who want me to win
Went to the lot and bought a new Benz
I hit the gas I'm gone with the wind
I'm only getting in where I fit in
This is a two-seater you cannot sit in
I got a dub in the rear end
I got caught when I fucked her friend
Say I wouldn't do it and did it again
I got some dogs who want me to win
Went to the lot and bought a new Benz
I hit the gas I'm gone with the wind

[Intro]
You dig?
You know what I'm sayin', I'm on that 4PF shit
You know what I'm sayin', I'm on that flooded Patek shit
I'm on that iced out Rollie shit, you dig?

[Chorus]
Keep me a check, I ain't got no regrets, if I said it I motherfuckin' meant it
Keep me a check, I ain't got no regrets, if I said it I motherfuckin' meant it
I'm a big dawg, a lieutenant
Brand new foreign, I ain't rented it

Keep me a check, I ain't got no regrets, if I said it I motherfuckin' meant it
Keep me a check, I ain't got no regrets, if I said it I motherfuckin' meant it

[Verse 1]
Hellcat, no scatpack, got a demon too
Beamer truck with the frog eyes, nigga who is you?
I'm gettin' money like rap dudes
I ain't even sold a record fool
All this money on me and it's blue
Neighborhood 6-0 the crew
If I don't do shit I'ma get me a check and I swear I'ma die 'bout these riches
These bankrolls too big for these britches
I heard that these niggas be snitches
I can't fuck with none of these new bitches
They can't wait to tell a nigga's business
I'ma stay on they ass 'til I'm finished
Run it up, it only took a minute
Fake daps and the fake hugs, most of these niggas be some haters
Salt don't kill players, these bitches still need favors
I done ran this shit way up
I can hear 'em screamin', "Wait up"
Drippin' on 'em, I got flavor
Lil nigga get your weight up

[Chorus]
Keep me a check, I ain't got no regrets, if I said it I motherfuckin' meant it
Keep me a check, I ain't got no regrets, if I said it I motherfuckin' meant it
I'm a big dawg, a lieutenant
Brand new foreign, I ain't rented it
All the cars came tinted
All the cars came tinted
Keep me a check, I ain't got no regrets, if I said it I motherfuckin' meant it
Keep me a check, I ain't got no regrets, if I said it I motherfuckin' meant it
I'm a big dawg, a lieutenant
Brand new foreign, I ain't rented it
All the cars came tinted
All the cars came tinted

[Verse 2]
Percocets got me traumatized
Nigga try me it's gon' be a homicide
They gon' run and hide when it's gunfire
Nigga I ain't lettin' shit slide
They gon' patrol with me, bitch I'm a G
I'ma make 'em fear it, respect it, or check it
I'm one of the real ones, tunnel vision on the way to the millions
Keep me a check, flooded Patek
I fuck with lil shawty, I bought her a Rollie
Pussy niggas tellin' lies, they don't know me
The same niggas talkin' down probably owe me
You a big dawg and I'm a big dawg but they know their motherfuckin' difference
Pushin' pounds, LA Fitness
I got twenty killers with me
I'ma go all the way this year, put it on my son
He gon' be a don, I'ma pop it 'til I'm done
Start throwin' dubs if I run out of ones
These niggas know how we come
Short Dracos with the big old drum
Run through it fast, I'ma break my thumbs, yeah

[Chorus]
Keep me a check, I ain't got no regrets, if I said it I motherfuckin' meant it
Keep me a check, I ain't got no regrets, if I said it I motherfuckin' meant it

Keep me a check, I ain't got no regrets, if I said it I motherfuckin' meant it
Keep me a check, I ain't got no regrets, if I said it I motherfuckin' meant it

[Outro]
I'ma pop my shit, ain't gon' bite my tongue, I'ma rock my shoes
I'ma keep my gun, I'ma rock my jewels, I'ma keep my gun

[Intro]
We Global now

[Verse 1]
Word on the street, they got a lil' bitty hit out
Really run Atlanta, I can make a nigga get out
If anything, I have more respect for you bitches
Nigga, you a bitch, we don't shoot and miss (Nah)
Glock-19 unfold and it spit out
Double R underneath the door when I get out
Clutchin' on my fans, had to tell lil' bro to chill out
How the fuck your whole gang down the road and you still out?
Undercover rat, pussy nigga, you a sellout
Every show I get either packed or it sell out
I been ballin' hard, you on the bench, you gotta sit out
Know a nigga mad, he can't even put a hit out
Middle of the winter, drop top with a mink on
Bad lil' vibe, yeah, she say that's her theme song
I done made a whole million dollars off a flip phone
No Soulja Boy, that bitch ain't even have a ringtone

[Chorus]
Skinny Mike Amiris like I skate
We just fuck around, we don't date
I went straight up there to Mars, so they hate
And I got a lot of cars, they all up to date
I was at the bottom, literally I was boxed in
Then I took off, I ain't have no other option
I was too gone, now a nigga just pop shit
I was in Japan, buyin' drip and blowin' yen

[Verse 2]
Call overseas, tell them youngins to spin again
I don't throw rocks and hide my hand 'cause I'm a man
Million cash in the book bag, I'm a big dog
Threw my shot at any nigga, bitch, I think I'm Chris Paul
Sippin' all these meds, nigga gotta be throwed off
I was gettin' head, fucked around and I dozed off
Rolls Royce truck, crank it and let the nose out
Everything I said, I went did it, boy, I'm the chosen child

[Chorus]
Skinny Mike Amiris like I skate
We just fuck around, we don't date
I went straight up there to Mars, so they hate
And I got a lot of cars, they all up to date
I was at the bottom, literally I was boxed in
Then I took off, I ain't have no other option
I was too gone, now a nigga just pop shit
I was in Japan, buyin' drip and blowin' yen

[Verse 3]
Safe deposit boxes on fleek
And my bank account, I don't touch it, I'ma get it out the street
Got your vibe all on my drip, she say you cheap
And she know I'm havin' money, buy her titties, ass, and teeth
Catchin' three flights every day, the only time I get some sleep
Kept it real and they be cappin', really you can't compete
I spend it all on bullets, niggas don't wanna beef
Got a D-boy swag, pull up SRT
I ain't playin' with nobody, nobody gon' play with me
Got a driver for my car, he take me from A to Z
Got some homies on the yard I probably'll never see
If the money was the issue I promise they'd be free
They was sleepin' on me bad, they fucked around, woke up a beast
Switch it up, I went romantic, took my shawty out to Greece
Every city that I go to, gotta link up with the street
I'm too humble for 'em, guess that's why they thinkin' I was sweet

[Chorus]
Skinny Mike Amiris like I skate
We just fuck around, we don't date
I went straight up there to Mars, so they hate
And I got a lot of cars, they all up to date
I was at the bottom, literally I was boxed in
Then I took off, I ain't have no other option
I was too gone, now a nigga just pop shit
I was in Japan, buyin' drip and blowin' yen

[Chorus: Lil Baby]
Lotta blue hunnids they came from the bank

Jeans expensive they fitting me tight
I can't do this the rest of my life
Free the bros down the road doing life
Trying to sleep every night with a knife

Fuck with snakes cause you niggas be mice
Diamonds hitting who cut off the lights

Soon as I get my money I'm gon' blow it
Fuck that, I'ma take mine and put it up
I got some foreign baddies in my DM they hitting me up
They trying to get on the plane today and come eat me up
She had the firest brain that I ever had
I gave her everything that I never had
I'm going next level on some more shit
These niggas dead broke on some hoe shit
Running that money up 'til I get tired
He said I wouldn't make it he lied
The codeine be all in my eyes
I'm doing that shit for the guys
She looked at my side like 'Who is that guy?'
That's my lil' brother G5
They call him Steven, I call him Curry
That nigga shoot out your eye

[Chorus: Lil Baby]
Lotta blue hunnids they came from the bank

[Verse 2: Moneybagg Yo]
Residue on me I'm fresh out the trap (Bando)
I gotta dust off my lap
I keep the ratchet like baps
Hundred round shots in the scrap
I'm on their face like a slap
You think you know me you jap (Lingo)
I hit your bitch you was wide open
I'm in her stomach like cramps
(Yeah, what'd you do? How'd you do it?)
Soon as I got my money I ran through it
(I fucked up some commas)
I couldn't believe I saved some, I thought I blew it
(I thought it was all gone)
I just downed a whole pint, I'm under the influence
Then I popped an Adderall to give me endurance
I'm up I cannot get tired, your bitch on molly, she wired
Tossed her with Moneybagg Myers
Plenty chains, clang clang, 50k plain Jane
Go get some money quit saying you can't
They thought I was born in the vault of the bank

[Chorus: Lil Baby]
Lotta blue hunnids they came from the bank
I drank this shit by the pint
If we leave then we fucking tonight
Jeans expensive they fitting me tight
I can't do this the rest of my life

Need another load, I sold my last brick

[Chorus: Lil Baby]
Exotic my cars and my broads and my reefer, yeah
They say it's cheaper to keep her, yeah
Fuck it, I'm rich so I left her
Shout out the plug, let me keep all the extra, yeah
I just pulled up in a Tesla, yeah
Pour me a four pop of 'Tussin, yeah
Forty pointers in my necklace
Fuck her and dip, ain't got no time for no breakfast, yeah

[Verse 1: Lil Baby]
I'm buildin' shit up like Tetris, yeah
I get the money invested, yeah
I get the pack from the West End, yeah
I send a pack to the West End, yeah
It's drippin', it's rare, you can't catch it, yeah
Servin' raw and fuck the Alphabet Boys
Quarter million, bought a couple of toys
Neighbors trippin', Demon make too much noise
Fifty racks every week off of shows
Movin' cautious like I'm still on parole
I can't fuck with bitches who be doin' the most
Screamin' fuck the system 'til they free all the bros
Shoot a thousand, bet a thousand a roll
If it ain't a thousand, man, that shit ain't no load
Country boys say they lovin' the road
You know me, I'm tryna serve 'em they dope

[Chorus: Lil Baby]
Exotic my cars and my broads and my reefer, yeah
They say it's cheaper to keep her, yeah
Fuck it, I'm rich so I left her
Shout out the plug, let me keep all the extra, yeah
I just pulled up in a Tesla, yeah
Pour me a four pop of 'Tussin, yeah
Forty pointers in my necklace
Fuck her and dip, ain't got no time for no breakfast

[Verse 2: Starlito]
Ridin' around with cuz, he got the L's for the straps
Three cell phones in my lap
I'm well known in the trap
Yeah, you know me, yeah, I used to sell your homies a set
Tell my hoes to relax
These niggas police, that's facts
Shots fired, I fleet in a foreign
Do he got a warrant?
My lawyer gon' see you in the morning, Lito ain't goin'
He got that heater when he be performin'
It's a 4 in that liter he pourin'
Baby nem sip like I used to
Love to shoot dice and I do too
Play with my life, I'ma shoot you
I'm way outta town with a pack in a rental
When I ain't rappin', they send 'em
Grindin' up half of a chicken
They catchin' cases, it's all gon' half from a twinner, midget
I rap what I'm livin'
Last whip, I wrecked it and I left it
Fuck it, I'm still livin' reckless
Told my lil' bitch that she selfish
Call up your bestie, I'm tired of fuckin' you separate

[Chorus: Lil Baby]
Exotic my cars and my broads and my reefer, yeah
They say it's cheaper to keep her, yeah
Fuck it, I'm rich so I left her
Shout out the plug, let me keep all the extra, yeah
I just pulled up in a Tesla, yeah
Pour me a four pop of 'Tussin, yeah
Forty pointers in my necklace
Fuck her and dip, ain't got no time for no breakfast

[Intro]
Cook that shit up, Quay

[Verse 1: Lil Baby]
I come from a different type of cloth than these niggas
I'ma buy a different type of car than these niggas
Ain't gon' fuck on none of these lil' bitches, they be hittin'
I gotta switch it up, man, I gotta move different, I'm a boss nigga
Yeah, show them youngins how to level up
Four Season hotel, sixty levels up
But I'm a resident
If you gon' do the crime, go hard, don't leave no evidence
I got 'em all on my wave 'cause it's evident
But where was y'all when I was lost, ain't know where to go?
She think I'm fly, she like my pimpin', but I can't save no ho
You only get one chance to cross me, then it's say no more
I gotta tell 'em go
I ain't hit your baby mama, I hit her with the curveball
I ain't hit your baby mama, I hit her with the curveball
And I'm still the same young hitter, used to serve y'all
Don't ever get it twisted, my youngins really flip shit
My youngins really flip shit, don't ever get it twisted
'Cause I'll really flip shit

[Chorus: Lil Baby]
I don't need no friends, I just wanna win
I got this new Benz and it's all I need
She listen to her friends, they wanna get in
She don't understand that they'll slob on me
If I let 'em, ain't gon' let up, I'ma keep on stridin'
Heard they lookin' for me, I can't tell 'cause I ain't hidin'
It don't matter if I'm frownin' 'cause my mama smilin'
I done finally went legit, ain't no more public housing
I gotta stay from 'round them

[Verse 2: Rylo Rodriguez]
I'm gon' pull up AMG like I don't know my alphabet
Youngins ain't on Instagram but they still want a blue check
If 12 go'n grab one more of my dawgs, I'ma sue the vet
I thought they all wanna see me ball, they'd rather go hide the nets
All these pointers in my watch but my Rolex ain't tellin' (Hell nah)
Know the drank the devil but when I'm on it, feel like I'm in heaven
In the hood shootin' dice, ask what it playin', we told him, "7"
Used to go to church 'til I seen MC serve the reverend
Pockets gettin' biggie, no Smalls, Faith Evans
Wonder why she don't wanna fuck when I ain't wearin' my necklace
They ain't picture me like this so I sent all them selfies
Pray you don't get caught in the mix, 'cause when we slide, it's deadly
I'ma pay her for that pussy, I won't lie, they petty
Nine hundred on jeans, we came from wearin' Moschino
When the paper comin' in, it'll drive you senile
It'll drive you crazy (It'll drive you insane)
Pray you take these lines and look back, oh, they all faded

[Chorus: Lil Baby]
I don't need no friends, I just wanna win
I got this new Benz and it's all I need
She listen to her friends, they wanna get in
She don't understand that they'll slob on me
If I let 'em, ain't gon' let up, I'ma keep on stridin'
Heard they lookin' for me, I can't tell 'cause I ain't hidin'
It don't matter if I'm frownin' 'cause my mama smilin'
I done finally went legit, ain't no more public housing
I gotta stay from 'round them

[Chorus: Hoodrich Pablo Juan]
I got too many hoes I can't fuck 'em all
Don't know how to play but I ball
Stacking that money up make it tall
Ooh, the ice on my neck got me frost
Mama ain't made no hoe, she made a boss
My diamonds they shine when the lights turned off
Rocking designer I'm dripping in sauce
All of my diamonds real so they cost
You know it costs to live like this
I got a bad lil boss bitch
Too many diamonds, camera glitch
Yeah I'm shining, I'm frostbit
Ain't got to tell them they know that I'm rich
I got a sack like I run the blitz
Ice cold like I got on mitts
Ice cream I look like a lick

[Verse 1: Lil Baby]
I made a hunnid in two days
Neighbour trippin' cause I keep the door swangin'
I drop a mixtape today, they gon' be thinking I got me a ghostwriter
AMG on the floor like a low rider
Having rich arguments my whole problem
Running money up I don't see nobody
Buying lawyers for bro 'cause them folks got 'em
Tennis chains on fleek, I could wear a new piece every week
Me and my diamonds all on pee, point
Ask about me, I dug deep for 'em
Hit the bitch Curry, three-point
I can't hit them all so I Pikachu
I don't text 'em I just stick and move
Fresh pair of Loubs

[Chorus: Hoodrich Pablo Juan]
I got too many hoes I can't fuck 'em all
Don't know how to play but I ball
Stacking that money up make it tall
Ooh, the ice on my neck got me frost
Mama ain't made no hoe, she made a boss
My diamonds they shine when the lights turned off
Rocking designer I'm dripping in sauce
All of my diamonds real so they cost
You know it costs to live like this
I got a bad lil boss bitch
Too many diamonds, camera glitch
Yeah I'm shining, I'm frostbit
Ain't got to tell them they know that I'm rich
I got a sack like I run the blitz
Ice cold like I got on mitts
Ice cream I look like a lick

[Verse 2: Hoodrich Pablo Juan]
Forty pointers that's a waffle cone
Ice cubes on my neck like my styrofoam
Drip, dripping like they left the shower on
Them ain't real, them diamonds are rhinestones
I'm straight I got the iron now
Too many hoes bought another phone
I apologize, AP honeycomb
Shorty walking round with like three hunnid on
Baby vanilla, my rose gold match the Gucci with rose petal
Trapper of the year I need a gold medal
You know the water make the pussy get wetter
Ooh, can't name a nigga that do it better
I got too many hoes like I'm Hugh Hefner
Different foreign bitches, I'ma put 'em together
Yeah they know I'm a trendsetter

[Chorus: Hoodrich Pablo Juan]
I got too many hoes I can't fuck 'em all
Don't know how to play but I ball
Stacking that money up make it tall
Ooh, the ice on my neck got me frost
Mama ain't made no hoe, she made a boss
My diamonds they shine when the lights turned off
Rocking designer I'm dripping in sauce
All of my diamonds real so they cost
You know it costs to live like this
I got a bad lil boss bitch
Too many diamonds, camera glitch
Yeah I'm shining, I'm frostbit
Ain't got to tell them they know that I'm rich
I got a sack like I run the blitz
Ice cold like I got on mitts
Ice cream I look like a lick

[Intro: Lil Baby]
Al Geno on the track
G just bounced back from a headshot
Trappin' by the roadblock
I only give until my legs out
Been a real nigga 'til my legs stop
Real trapper, my legs tired
Real trapper, my legs tired
Yeah, yeah

[Chorus: NoCap]
My life was hard, it just had to be (Yeah)
Watch me turn my dreams to reality (Yeah)
I'm runnin' outfield, them demons after me (Yeah)
When I pop these Percs, I don't do it happily
Got a little fame, all of a sudden they change
Feel like shovel with dirt thrown side of my name
I was so blind, I just couldn't see the hate
Forgave all them niggas, I'm still Ray

[Verse 1: Lil Baby]
Would have never started rappin' if I knew this shit had came with this
If I had never made a hit, would they be on my dick?
I just been sittin' back and pushin' pounds, just gettin' fit
And I got a 60 on my right wrist, I'm movin' fast like lightnin'
These other rappers tryna bite me, your baby mama wanna bite me
I swear to God she triflin', I pass her on 'cause I'm righteous
I run the jungle like Tarzan, that codeine was like poison
I cut back, I feel awesome, no playoffs but I'm ballin'
Had a good day, I scored 40 and I ain't talkin' points
I close my eyes, I still have flashbacks when I was in the joint
I hit my knees, I'm thankin' God, I'm prayin' every mornin'
I check the schedule and I'm booked up, I'm finally tourin'
I'm goin' where I wanna go, doin' what I wanna do
I can screw who I wanna screw, I came from nothin', I can never lose
Turned my dreams into reality, I thought that you'd be glad for me
I can't believe that you mad at me, damn, dawg, I'm proud of you
My life was garbage, too, but I did what I 'posed to do
And I went and bought the latest coupe, told my young nigga stay in school
But he ain't listen, now he got a .45 in the kitchen with a biscuit ready to flip it

[Chorus: Lil Baby & NoCap, NoCap, & Lil Baby]
My life was hard, it just had to be (Had to be)
Watch me turn my dreams to reality (Reality)
I'm runnin' outfield, them demons after me (I feel 'em after me)
When I pop these Percs, I don't do it happily (I don't do it happily)
Got little fame, all of a sudden they change
Feel like shovel with dirt thrown side of my name
I was so blind, I just couldn't see the hate
Forgave all them niggas, I'm still Ray

[Verse 2: NoCap]
Would have never started rappin' if I knew this shit had came with this
I'm on top of all these niggas, I can see when all these angels piss
The way my nigga crossed me up, I thought his name was Chris
Don't wanna fuck around and kill my dawg, they gon' do me like I'm Vick
Yeah, they gon' really hate me if I sign a deal
I'ma go buy a Wraith, crash it on purpose, blame it on the pills
When Lil' Joe be slidin', it be look like he headed to second base
I see the hate, it look like makeup, it's all on their face
I can't see Fred no more so I be talkin' to his headstone
Sometimes I wanna catch a body, but I put my head on
Crawford finna touch down, he in the red zone
I sure got tired of sendin' him naked pictures of my red bone
Yeah, G just bounced right back off a headshot
Yeah, I won't fuck that bitch if she ain't got no ass shots
Put them choppers on the jet, we gon' air it out
25 hundred on some trap gear, we gon weigh it out
Too much dirty money, won't put that shit in the shower
Even when lights out, boy, that money still bring power
Can't serve a lot of white, but that shit look like baby powder
Got my gun at every show, I don't care if it ain't crowded
I barely sleep, but when I do, I just be dreamin'
They know I came from the bottom like bikinis
When I can't get hold to them Percs, I be fiendin'
Why would you tell me that you love me and you don't mean it?

[Chorus: NoCap]
My life was hard, it just had to be (Yeah)
Watch me turn my dreams to reality (Yeah)
I'm runnin' outfield, them demons after me (Yeah)
When I pop these Percs, I don't do it happily
Got a little fame, all of a sudden they change
Feel like shovel with dirt thrown side of my name
I was so blind, I just couldn't see the hate
Forgave all them niggas, I'm still Ray

[Outro]
Would have never started rappin' if I knew this shit had came with this
I'm on top of all these niggas, I can see when all these angels piss
The way my nigga crossed me up, I thought his name was Chris
Don't wanna fuck around and kill my dawg, they gon' do me like I'm Vick
Yeah, they gon' really hate me if I sign a deal
I'ma go buy a Range, crash it on purpose, blame it on the pills
When Lil' Joe be slidin', it be look like he headed to second base
I see the hate, it look like makeup, it's all on their face

[Intro]
Cook that shit up, Quay
Four Pockets Full yeah, Four Pockets Full yeah
Four Pockets Full yeah, Four Pockets Full yeah

[Chorus]
Faded, I'm on that sizzurp
Then I'ma light my spliff up
I'm a big dog, y'all niggas teacups
On the jet gettin' brain with my feet up
I don't bite my tongue, I'ma speak up
Send a hit, watch them young niggas eat up
No deer but a nigga got big bucks
Stayed down on my grind and I came up

[Verse 1]
Bitch I don't milly rock, I get the money
I got two bitches with me tryna jump me
Remember them old heads wouldn't front me
I'm shittin' on 'em, got 'em holdin' they stomach
That paper on me, gettin' it in by the bundle
The things they dream about a nigga done done it
Them bitches was stiff on the kid, they was frontin'
Now I'm stickin' dick all in they stomach
Drip season nigga, shout out to Gunna
No pussy in me but they know how I'm comin'
Drop a bag and he'll be dead in the morning
Headshots, I ain't sending no warnings
We don't shoot at houses, we hit a target
They  know I'm throwed off, they see I'm a target
No back and forth, we ain't doin' no walkin'
I stand on my words, I ain't doin' no barkin'

[Chorus]
Faded, I'm on that sizzurp
Then I'ma light my spliff up
I'm a big dog, y'all niggas teacups
On the jet gettin' brain with my feet up
I don't bite my tongue, I'ma speak up
Send a hit, watch them young niggas eat up
No deer but a nigga got big bucks
Stayed down on my grind and I came up

[Verse 2]
Came up on them niggas, didn't it
Hundred racks on me, I'ma spend it
This ain't Lacoste, nigga this Givenchy
Thousand pounds, me and Ced split it
Free Lil Steve, screamin' fuck the system
Dog I ain't know that was your sister
If I knew I still woulda hit her
Goin' crazy on them niggas, woah
Got the streets in a figure four
Your baby mama got a deep throat
I ain't kiddin', I don't tell jokes
Who want beef, I want all the smoke
I'm ballin' on these niggas, check the score
Flexin' on the Gram with your bro
Your bitch told me everything I know
Diss me nigga, you gon' get exposed

[Chorus]
Faded, I'm on that sizzurp
Then I'ma light my spliff up
I'm a big dog, y'all niggas teacups
On the jet gettin' brain with my feet up
I don't bite my tongue, I'ma speak up
Send a hit, watch them young niggas eat up
No deer but a nigga got big bucks
Stayed down on my grind and I came up

[Outro]
Came up, came up on them niggas
I got digits, I got commas, I got figures
We got sticks, we got choppers, we got MACs
We ain't goin' for that

[Intro]
Yeah
Cook that shit up, Quay
I look up, I see I got bout seven rides in the streets
Know what I'm saying?
Living life to the fullest, you know what I'm saying?

[Chorus]
Ain't got no regrets, I can't complain my life is great (I'm straight)
I just woke up today made a hundred thousand dollar play
I sold a hundred bags before an hour hit
So many blue hundreds they stickin' like they counterfeit, I print this shit
Whole lot of ones, I'm in the cut, I'm going dumb-dumb
I'm sippin' act', and that some real deal, do you want some?
Same ones tryin' run with the clique
Be the same ones that throwing salt on the clique
Main reason why I'm fuckin' ya bitch, I ain't gon' say shit

[Verse 1]
I asked you about it, you lied
You asked me about it, I kept it one hundred, I'm nothin' like these other guys
I really spent two thousand on kicks and only wear 'em one time
Something about a nigga mind frame
Diamonds doing jumpin'-jacks in the AP, I can make the time change
Two hundred hoes in my call log and I ain't got not a name saved
Took her out the hood, put her on the drip, now I got her rockin' name brand
Me and Ced had two different spots, we usually around the corner doin' the same thing
Everywhere I go my chains hang, free the bros out the chain gang
New Maybach cost 230, I don't even get my shoes dirty
I don't even sleep when I get tired, you can see the Adderall in my eyes
Tiger said he got the drop on the opps
Fuck it slide and shoot up the block
Niggas know how we come through
G5 out the sunroof

[Chorus]
Ain't got no regrets, I can't complain my life is great (I'm straight)
I just woke up today made a hundred thousand dollar play
I sold a hundred bags before an hour hit
So many blue hundreds they stickin' like they counterfeit, I print this shit
Whole lot of ones, I'm in the cut, I'm going dumb-dumb
I'm sippin' act', and that some real deal, do you want some?
Same ones tryin' run with the clique
Be the same ones that throwing salt on the clique
Main reason why I'm fuckin' ya bitch, I ain't gon' say shit

[Verse 2]
We use trap out my mom house, turn the condo to a hideout
We can't be fuckin' at my house, niggas be runnin' they damn mouth
Walk down on them broad daylight, it ain't no fun in no drive-by
I'm cool on the love and the high-fives
You niggas can't keep up with my guys
You can't get all this drip in a lifetime
I got out and ran it up at the right time
We got Dracos whenever it's nighttime
We ain't ever gonna stop at the stop sign
Went to Wafi, I told 'em I want to shine
Then the coupe quarter million, they wiped me down
I'm running this town, everything I say facts niggas can't take that
New Lamborghini 18'
Only thing I do is make cream, I don't why these niggas hating
Only thing I do is drink lean, rest in peace to Fredo Santana
I just keep on buying all these Fantas
I don't want to go out like that, only thing I know is get racks

[Chorus]
Ain't got no regrets, I can't complain my life is great (I'm straight)
I just woke up today made a hundred thousand dollar play
I sold a hundred bags before an hour hit
So many blue hundreds they stickin' like they counterfeit, I print this shit
Whole lot of ones, I'm in the cut, I'm going dumb-dumb
I'm sippin' act', and that some real deal, do you want some?
Same ones tryin' run with the clique
Be the same ones that throwing salt on the clique
Main reason why I'm fuckin' ya bitch, I ain't gon' say shit

[Intro]
Ain't this what they've been waitin' for?
You ready? Uh, uh

[Verse 1]
I used to pray for times like this, to rhyme like this
So I had to grind like that to shine like this
And the matter of time I spent on some locked-up shit
In the back of the paddy wagon, cuffs locked on wrists
Seen my dreams unfold, nightmares come true
It was time to marry the game and I said, "Yeah, I do"
If you want it you gotta see it with a clear-eyed view
Got a shorty, she tryna bless me like I said achoo
Like a nigga sneezed, nigga please, 'fore them triggers squeeze
I'm gettin' cream, never let them hoes get in between
Of what we started, lil' nigga but I'm lion-hearted
They love me when I was stuck and they hated when I departed
I go and get it regardless, draw it like I'm an artist
No crawlin', went straight to walkin', with foreigns in my garages
All foreign bitches m'nagin', fuckin', suckin' and swallowin'
Anything for a dollar, they tell me get 'em, I got 'em
I did it without an album
I did shit with Mariah
Lil' nigga, I'm on fire
Icy as a hockey rink, Philly nigga, I'm flyer
When I bought the Rolls Royce they thought it was leased
Then I bought that new Ferrari, hater, rest in peace
Hater, rest in peace, rest in peace to the parking lot
Phantom so big, can't even fit in the parking spot
You ain't talkin' 'bout my niggas, then what you talkin' 'bout?
Gangstas move in silence, nigga, and I don't talk a lot
I don't say a word, I don't say a word
Was on my grind and now I got what I deserve, fuck nigga!
Maybach Music

[Verse 2]
Hold up, wait a minute (Minute), y'all thought I was finished? (Whoa)
When I bought that Aston Martin, y'all thought it was rented? (Yeah)
Flexin' on these niggas, I'm like Popeye on his spinach
Double M, yeah that's my team, Rozay the captain, I'm lieutenant
I'm the type to count a million cash then grind like I'm broke
That Lambo' my new bitch, she don't ride like my Ghost
I'm ridin' around my city with my hand strapped on my toast
'Cause these niggas want me dead and I gotta make it back home
'Cause my mama need that bill money, my son need some milk
These niggas tryna take my life, they fuck around, get killed
You fuck around, you fuck around, you fuck around, get smoked
'Cause these Philly niggas I brought with me don't fuck around, no joke, no
All I know is murder, when it come to me
I got young niggas that's rollin', I got niggas throwin' B's
I done did the DOA's, I done did the KOD's
Every time I'm in that bitch, I get to throwin' 30 G's
But now I'm hangin' out that drop head, I'm ridin' down on Collins (Skrrt)
They let my nigga Ern back home, that young nigga be wildin' (Let's go)
We young niggas, we mobbin' (Mobbin'), like Batman and we're robbin' (Whoa)
This two-door Maybach with my seat all reclinin'
I'm like, "Real nigga, what up? Real nigga, what up?"
If you ain't about that murder game, then pussy nigga, shut up!
If you diss me in your raps I'll get yo' pussy-ass stuck up
When you touchdown in my hood, no that tour life ain't good
Catch me down in MIA at that Heat game on wood
With that Puma life on my feet like that little engine I could
Boy, I slide down on your block (Block), bike on 12 o'clock (Rah)
And they be throwin' deuces on the same nigga they watch (Meek Milly)
And I'm the king of my city 'cause I'm still callin' them shots
And these lames talkin' that bullshit the same niggas that flopped
I'm the same nigga from Berks Street with them nappy braids, that lock
The same nigga that came up and I had to wait for my spot
And these niggas hatin' on me, hoes waitin' on me
Still on that hood shit, my Rolls-Royce on E
They gon' remember me, I say remember me
So much money, have yo' friends turn in yo' enemies
And when there's beef, I turn my enemies to memories
With them bricks they go for 40, ain't no 10 a key
Hold up, broke nigga turned rich (Rich), love the game like Mitch
And if I leave, you think them pretty hoes gon' still suck my dick?
It was somethin' 'bout that Rollie when it first touched my wrist
Had me feelin' like that dope boy when he first touched that brick
I'm gone
Woo!

[Chorus: Chris Brown with Nicki Minaj]
Yeah, yeah, baby, is you drunk? Is you had enough?

[Verse 2: Nicki Minaj & Meek Mill]
Yo, he was the realest, I was the baddest, we was the illest
When he approached me, I said, "Yo what the deal is?"
In and out them dealers, rockin' chinchillas
I got him in the back of that 'bach, I think he catchin' feelings
Now it's all eyes on us, and this all lies on trust
And if them bitches wanna trip, tell 'em they tour guide's on us
This kitty cat on reclusive, he duck, duckin' them gooses
I put him on to that new new, now he only fuck with exclusives
He was like (What's your name?) My name Nick
(Where you from?) New York in this bitch
(Choose and pick) You got the right one
All them hoes, ain't nothin' like them
Nigga, you know you'd never wife them
None of them niggas ain't never hit this
Still at the top of all they hit lists
What they gon' do? Meek and Nick

[Chorus: Chris Brown, Nicki Minaj, Chris Brown & Nicki Minaj]
Yeah, baby, is you drunk? Is you had enough?

Give it all up for you right now
We got the club goin' crazy
All eyes, all eyes on you

[Outro: Meek Mill, Nicki Minaj & (Chris Brown)]
She was the baddest, he was the realest (ooh, ooh)
We was the flyest, we was the illest
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)
I was the realest, I was the baddest (ooh, ooh)
We was the flyest, up in the buildin' (oh, ooh)
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)

[Intro: Drake]
Yeah, views, views, views
Yeah, yeah, alright

[Verse 1: Drake]
Old ways, new women, gotta keep a balance
The girl of your dreams to me is probably not a challenge
I've been counted out so many times, I couldn't count it
Funny how now my accountant is havin' trouble tryna count it
To the people that think that I owe you shit
Payback's a bitch and you know that shit
Y'all niggas gettin' too old for this
Please don't think nobody notices
I've been up for way too many days
Y'all sleep enough for me anyway
Y'all don't be doin' shit anyway
Y'all are not true to this anyway
OVO, East End, Reps Up, we might just get hit with the R.I.C.O
Everyone home for the summer, so let's not do nothing illegal
I go make 50 million then I give some millions to my people
They gon' go Tony Montana and cop them some Shaq at the free throws
But they're from the way fam, there's not much to say fam
They told me to tell you you mans are some wastemans
And stay in your place fam
My dad is from Memphis, and I am the king
I should probably just move into Graceland
Madonna's a ting I know and I'm the king of pop
I'm building Never-Never Land
How he hate me when I never met the man, woo!

[Refrain: Drake]
We might just get hit with the R.I.C.O

[Verse 2: Meek Mill]
Meek Milly!
'Cause we in the field with them birds like we play for the Eagles
I'm on probation so let me not talk what's illegal (Switch it up)
Today I woke up with my dream girl, she rich as a Beatle
For my teachers that said I wouldn't make it here
I spend a day what you make a year
I had to drop this to make it clear
That I got it locked like Jamaican hair
All theses choppers poppin', niggas wildin', violence
Why we even got to take it here?
Why we even got to play these games?
Run up on me, catch a facial there
It's the Chasers, what you thought?
I come through my block like I'm Rico
Poppin' a wheelie, no squealie, can't talk to the cops, that's illegal
I was like more a Rich Porter, no double-crossing on my peoples
I take an M to the table and split it with my niggas equal
I'm back on that hood shit, yeah that wish you would shit
I'm talking that cross you that fade you fourth quarter
Like Jordan, we back on that bullshit
We came up from nothing
We started on list's most wanted but now it's the Forbes list
We really was doing shit
I can hear echoes from feds on this beat from informants
I think they recording
Shhh, listen, you hear that?

[Refrain: Drake]
We might just get hit with the R.I.C.O
We might just get hit with the R.I.C.O

[Intro: Drake & Future]
Yeah
(Wheezy outta here)
Jeez, jeez

[Verse 1: Drake]
Back home, smokin' legal (Legal)
I got more slaps than The Beatles (Beatles)
Foreign shit runnin' on diesel, dawg
Playin' with my name, that shit is lethal, dawg (Who you say you was?)
Don Corleone
Trust me, at the top it isn't lonely (Strapped)
Everybody actin' like they know me, dawg
Don't just say you're down, you gotta show me (What you gotta do?)
Bring the clip back empty (It's empty)
You asked to see the boss, so they sent me, dawg (Sent me, dawg)
I just broke her off with a 10-piece, dawg (10-piece, dawg)
That ain't nothin', I'm just bein' friendly, dawg

[Chorus: Drake]
It's just a lil' 10-piece for her
Just to blow it in the mall, doesn't mean that we're involved
I just... what? I just... uh, put a Richard on the card
I ain't grow up playin' ball, but I'll show you how the fuck you gotta do it
If you really wanna ball 'til you fall
When your back against the wall
And a bunch of niggas need you to go away
Still goin' bad on 'em anyway
Saw you last night, but did it broad day

[Post-Chorus: Drake]
Yeah, lot of Murakami in the hallway (What?)
Got a sticky and I keep it at my dawg's place
Girl, I left your love at Magic, now it's all shade
Still goin' bad on you anyway

[Interlude: Meek Mill]
Woah, woah, ooh, woah
Woah, woah, ah

[Verse 2: Meek Mill]
I could fit like 80 racks in my Amiris (80 racks)
Me and Drizzy back-to-back, it's gettin' scary (Back-to-back)
If you fuckin' with my opps, just don't come near me (Get outta my way)
Put some bands all on your head like Jason Terry (Brrt, brrt, ooh)
Richard Mille cost a Lambo (That's a Lambo)
Known to keep the baddest bitches on commando (Salute)
Every time I'm in my trap, I move like Rambo (Extended)
Ain't a neighborhood in Philly that I can't go (That's a Fendi)
For real
She said, "Oh, you rich rich?" ("You rich rich")
Bitch, I graduated, call me "Big Fish" (Marlin)
I got Lori Harvey on my wish list (That's Lori)
That's the only thing I want for Christmas (True story, uh)
I've been had my way out here, yeah, know that's facts (Facts)
You ain't livin' that shit you say, yeah, we know that's cap (That's cap)
You ain't got to ask me when you see me, know I'm strapped (Brrt)
DC, OVO, we back again, we goin' plat' (Ooh, ooh)

[Chorus: Drake]
It's just a lil' 10-piece for her
Just to blow it in the mall, doesn't mean that we're involved
I just... what? I just... uh, put a Richard on the card
I ain't grow up playin' ball, but I'll show you how the fuck you gotta do it
If you really wanna ball 'til you fall
When your back against the wall
And a bunch of niggas need you to go away
Still goin' bad on 'em anyway
Saw you last night, but did it broad day

[Outro: Future]
Wheezy outta here

[Produced by Jahlil Beats & Swizz Beatz]

[Intro]
I just wanna know how niggas going to jail
Telling on niggas, coming back home and it still being cool
I just wanna know how a nigga on Instagram and Twitter with fifty thousand followers
Ain't got no money in real life, but still popping, I just wanna know
I wanna know, if a nigga ain't really putting it in, but acting like he putting it in
Niggas still letting it fly like it's cool, I really wanna know man
This shit getting different out here it's getting spooky

[Verse 1: Meek Mill + Quentin Miller]
Now when that shit went down with Chris, you wrote a check
In New Orleans wore my chain to get respect (you a fraud)
So what that tell me? You a pussy and a fed
Say the wrong shit you know the shooters at your neck
I just wanna know, if you ain't write that running through the six shit
Tell us who the fuck was Quentin running through the six with?
"Running through the six with my woes
Counting money, you know how it goes
All the real live forever, baby
And the fake get exposed"
Niggas writing for you cause you know you never did shit
When I threw that hook out, I was tryin' to catch a big fish
We the type of niggas to tie your mother up
Fuck your sister in the ass and hit your brother up, pussy
You really sweet, I call you buttercup
You fucking dork you changed the style because you studied us
Coming with the same flow
Switching up your lingo
We just want a refund, this ain't what we paid for
Every time that we come, we get what we came for
Spitting another niggas shit, but you claim you king though?

[Hook]
I just wanna know, I just wanna know
How these niggas acting like they trill but really fake
And people acting like it go
I just wanna know, I just wanna know
Was it Quentin Miller? Was it Hush or was it Detail where you really got your flow?
(Milli Vanilli that nigga)

[Verse 2]
Money make a fake ass nigga look real again
Money make a sucker that told look trill again
Says a lot about all the people that's feeling him
But I'ma show you bitch ass niggas what's real again
Heard that other nigga talking we ain't get back yet
Let's keep it short, nigga you ain't get your chick back yet
And now she rocking with the chaser and now you missed that check
You went from Clear Port to boarding pass you miss that jet, hold up

[Interlude 1: Sample]
"Cat, I got to take them off of here'that's right'I got to take them off of here, there's only one, and that's me, you understand?
'Fore all that fighting, you understand? Sucka thinks he good'sucka thinks he can whoop me, And I know he can't whoop me and I'Hey, boy, the nigga whole style is chump, you understand? When it comes to me, you understand, let me get mines first. Then after I get mine, y'all can do what you wanna do."

[Verse 3]
You know you fucked up right?
You shoulda just said nothing
Now you're going to have to give me a check to stop
All I hear is platinum that platinum this
Meanwhile I'm on the carpet with a platinum chick
I got a platinum rollie, platinum whip
Niggas frauds I told the truth, don't ask me shit
All this industry fake enemy and rap shit
It's never really my style we got cash to get
I really started from nothing now it's back to shit
Puffy almost caught a domestic when he smacked that bitch
Hold up, let that bitch breathe

[Interlude 2: Diddy]
"Yeah, this is called poppin' shit. There's no cut on it. There's no cut on it. If your feelings get hurt, you feel like, "Oh, that's an arrogant little comment'" no, this is the truth and the truth hurts. Haven't I paid my dues? Haven't I weathered the storm? Didn't I weather the storm? Niggas is gone and I'm here."

[Outro]
You let Tip homie piss on you in a movie theater nigga, we ain't forget
Real niggas back in style this shit is lit
This that Ja Rule shit and 50 Cent

[Intro: Meek Mill]
I just wanna thank God
For all the pretty women he let into my life
All the Benjamins you let me count
Wealth and health
For my family
And lettin' me ball on these niggas

[Hook: Meek Mill]
Now there's a lot of bad bitches in the building (Amen)
A couple real niggas in the building (Amen)
I'm finna kill niggas in the building (Amen)
I tell the waiter fifty bottles and she tell me say when
And I say church (Preach)
We make it light up like a church (Preach)
She wanna fuck and I say church (Preach)
Do Liv on Sunday like a church (Preach)

[Verse 1: Meek Mill]
Bottle after bottle, drink until I overdose
Pull up in the Phantom, watch them bitches catch the Holy Ghost
Errtime I step up in the dealer I be goin' broke
Shorty wanna fuck me, I say get on top and roller coast
And I lay back, she go cray, fuck me good, but she no stay
Murder on that pussy let her boyfriend get that DOA
Get it? And all I get is Frito Lay
Plus I'm on probation, when they test me I just pee Ros'
Cause last night, I went hard, Peach Ciroc, Patron and all
Thirty racks on magnum bottles, I think I was born to ball
Lookin' like a million plus, fresh I'm out that corner store
Hater I be doin' me, you guys should be doin' y'all
I'm stackin' money to the ceiling
All this ice that's in my Rollie I be chilling
And I just made a couple million
So I could take care of them children, let's go

[Hook: Meek Mill]
Now there's a lot of bad bitches in the building (Amen)
A couple real niggas in the building (Amen)
I'm finna kill niggas in the building (Amen)
I tell the waiter fifty bottles and she tell me say when
And I say church (Preach)
We make it light up like a church (Preach)
She wanna fuck and I say church (Preach)

[Verse 2: Drake]
Just bought my niggas some caine, so much it came with a plane
Bought my niggas some dope, so much it came with a boat
I just bought me a crib so big it came with a moat
For niggas jumping the fence I hope you niggas can float
And I just hope that I'm forgiven for carin' 'bout how they livin'
And loanin a little money and keepin' 'em out of prison
I ain't lyin' in my verses I'm just telling you the basics
Of growin' up with your friends and becomin the one that made it
Yes lord! All gold, man I got these bitches soul
Talking bout these other rappers getting old is even getting old
Worrying about your followers, you need to get your dollars up
Me and Meek, young niggas poppin' like our collars up
And good ain't good enough, and your hood ain't hood enough
Spent my whole life puttin on, you spend your whole life puttin up
Ain't no telling when I go, so there ain't shit that I'ma wait for
I'm the type to say a prayer, then go get what I just prayed for

[Hook: Meek Mill]
Now there's a lot of bad bitches in the building (Amen)
A couple real niggas in the building (Amen)
I'm finna kill niggas in the building (Amen)
I tell the waiter fifty bottles and she tell me say when
And I say church (Preach)
We make it light up like a church (Preach)
She wanna fuck and I say church (Preach)
Do Liv on Sunday like a church (Preach)

[Verse 3: Meek Mill and (Jeremih)]
Lord forgive me for my sins, I'm just tryna win
And she a devil in a dress but if she knock I let her in
And if she knock I let her in
I have her wet by 12 o' clock, then 3 o' clock she wet again
I'm screaming Oh Lord, that pussy good, that pussy good
I'm tryna hold on, I wish I could, you think I should
She got that million dollar body, shorty my Bugatti
And she said she got a man, we keep it secret Illuminati
(Got Patron on deck) And Ciroc all in my bottle
(Push it all on her) She was on that Reposado
(She take it all off) And I think I'll rep Serato
In this bitch I'm spending like I hit the lotto, cause it's a lot of...

[Hook: Meek Mill]
Now there's a lot of bad bitches in the building (Amen)
A couple real niggas in the building (Amen)
I'm finna kill niggas in the building (Amen)

[Skit: Maleek]
Get it right Terio
Ooh, ooh kill 'em, ooh kill 'em, ooh

[Intro: Meek Mill]
You ready? You ready?
I don't think they is

[Verse 1: Meek Mill]
Nowadays everybody wanna talk like they got something to say
But nothing comes out when they move they lips
I spit crack for my niggas that be moving bricks
With they exclusive bitch
Sippin' on Amaretto when she loose and shit
Niggas sleeping on me then I Freddy Krueger shit
With a few Philly niggas that be shootin' shit
I'm like Dre, I wish I had my nigga Snupe for this
Oh, I grew up, I screw up a oz of crack
Then I blew up they knew us before all this rap
I maneuvered with shooters
You fuck around with me, get smoked like a hookah
My ruger go booyah, I do it for the streets
You do it for the nigga with the backpack
I do it for the niggas on the corner
Tryna make a meal ticket with a crack pack
Hold up wait a minute let me back track
Hov gave you 24, let you have that
Man you claiming you the king of New York
What the fuck wrong with you nigga, step back
Hundred shots, aim straight at your snap cap
Everybody want the crown so I snatch that
Heard your gun go doo-doo-dooo-dooo
Well my gun go blat-blat-blat-blat-blat
What the fuck I gotta whisper to niggas
To earn my respect just to get to these niggas
Go Ether, Takeover or Jigga on niggas
Or really go 2Pac and Biggie on niggas
What the fuck wrong with him
Like really I'm sick of you niggas
You've been in the game like a year and some change
And you feeling yourself so I'm killing these niggas like...

[Bridge: Meek Mill]
(H-h-h-hold up, wait)
Let the beat come back and the streets come back
Niggas on the west tryna make the east come back
Make me grow these nappy braids, make the beast come back like
(H-h-h-hold up, wait)
And a nigga fuck around get the R.I.C.O Act
Shoot shoot, and one, where my free throw at?
And my lil' nigga Bobby can't eat those flats
Like ooh kill 'em, ooh kill 'em
Ooh kill 'em, ooh kill 'em

[Verse 2: Meek Mill]
They know Meek Milly, I barely went gold
But Meek Milly look like he sold two million
All this new money I'm getting my nigga
I swear I don't know what to do with it
Yeah it's Meek Milly, I'm bombing on rappers
I really don't give a fuck who with 'em
Pair with a nigga like me one time, like me one time
And ya'll forgot about me
Acting like I don't really want mine
What the fuck wrong with em
Know how we feeling, let me get back to it
Terio like ooh kill 'em, ooh kill 'em
Ooh kill 'em, ooh kill 'em, ooh kill 'em, ooh

[Intro: Meek Mill]
You know what free is, nigga?

[Chorus: Meek Mill]
What's free?
Free is when nobody else could tell us what to be
Free is when the TV ain't controllin' what we see
Told my niggas, "I need you"
Through all the fame, you know I stayed true
Pray my niggas stay free
Made a few mistakes but this ain't where I wanna be
Before I'm judged by 12, put a 12 on my V
Told my niggas, "I need you"
Stay up, I know these times ain't true
Real life, what's free?

[Verse 1: Rick Ross]
Since a lad, I was cunning, just got a pad out in London
I keep stackin' my money, I'll need a ladder by summer
AK shots, niggas duckin' stray shots
Been a top dog, that's before the K-Dots
Crackin' in '06, immaculate showmanship
Talkin' like you Mitch, disastrous on the strip
Holdin' on your bitch, coulda never sold you a brick
With them people, you never been on a list
Mona Lisa to me ain't nothin' but a bitch
Hangin' pictures like niggas swingin' from his dick
We so different, you thought these didn't exist (M-M)
The Megalodon never seen on his wrist
I'm from the South where they never make it this rich
God is the greatest, but Satan been on his shit
Walkin' the pavement, I pray I'm illuminated
Over a decade and never nobody's favorite
Pot and kilo go hand in hand like we Gamble and Huff
My amigo, a million grams and we countin' 'em up (M-M)
You was dead broke, I let you hold a pack
You paid for it, but I fucked around and stole the track
Screaming "gang gang," now you wanna rat
Racketeering charges caught him on a tap
Lookin' for a bond, lawyers wanna tax
Purple hair got them faggots on your back
(M-M-Maybach music)

[Chorus: Meek Mill]
What's free?
Free is when nobody else could tell us what to be
Free is when the TV ain't controllin' what we see
Told my niggas, "I need you"
Through all the fame, you know I stayed true
Pray my niggas stay free
Made a few mistakes but this ain't where I wanna be
Before I'm judged by 12, put a 12 on my V
Told my niggas, "I need you"
Stay up, I know these times ain't true
Real life, what's free? (Yeah)

[Verse 2: Meek Mill]
Fed investigations, heard they plottin' like I trap
20 mill' in cash, they know I got that off of rap
Maybe it's the Michael Rubins or the Robert Krafts
Or the billionaire from Marcy, and the way they got my back, uh
See how I prevailed now they try to knock me back, uh
Locked me in a cell for all them nights and I won't snap, uh
Two-fifty a show and they still think I'm sellin' crack, uh
When you bring my name up to the judge, just tell him facts
Tell him how we fundin' all these kids to go to college
Tell him how we ceasin' all these wars, stoppin' violence
Tryna fix the system and the way that they designed it
I think they want me silenced (Shush)
Oh, say you can see, I don't feel like I'm free
Locked down in my cell, shackled from ankle to feet
Judge bangin' that gavel, turned me to slave from a king
Another day in the bing, I gotta hang from a string
Just for poppin' a wheelie, my people march through the city
From a cell to a chopper, view from the top of the city
You can tell how we rockin', soon as I pop up we litty
Poppin' like Bad Boy in '94, Big Poppa and Diddy
And niggas counted me out like my accountant ain't busy
That's five milli' in twenties, sit up and count 'til I'm dizzy
Phantom 500 thousand, hundred round in a stizzy
Is we beefin' or rappin'? I might just pop up with Drizzy like

[Chorus: Meek Mill & JAY-Z]
What's free?
Free is when nobody else could tell us what to be
Free is when the TV ain't controllin' what we see
Told my niggas, "I need you"
Through all the fame, you know I stayed true
Pray my niggas stay free
Made a few mistakes but this ain't where I wanna be
Before I'm judged by 12, put a 12 on my V
Told my niggas, "I need you"
Stay up, I know these times ain't true (Run it down)
Real life, what's free?

[Verse 3: JAY-Z]
In the land of the free, where the blacks enslaved
Three-fifths of a man, I believe's the phrase
I'm 50% of D'USS' and it's debt free (Yeah)
100% of Ace of Spades, worth half a B (Uh)
Roc Nation, half of that, that's my piece
Hunnid percent of TIDAL to bust it up with my Gs, uh
'Cause most of my niggas won't ever work together
You run a check up but they never give you leverage
No red hat, don't Michael and Prince me and 'Ye
They separate you when you got Michael and Prince's DNA, uh
I ain't one of these house niggas you bought
My house like a resort, my house bigger than yours
My spou- (Come on, man)
My route better, of course
We started without food in our mouth
They gave us pork and pig intestines
Shit you discarded that we ingested, we made the project a wave
You came back, reinvested and gentrified it
Took niggas' sense of pride, now how that's free?
And them people stole the soul and hit niggas with 360s, huh
I ain't got a billion streams, got a billion dollars
Inflating numbers like we 'posed to be happy about this
We was praisin' Billboard, but we were young
Now I look at Billboard like, "Is you dumb?"
To this day, Grandma 'fraid what I might say
They gon' have to kill me, Grandmama, I'm not they slave
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha, check out the bizarre (Ah)
Rappin' style used by me, the H-O-V
Look at my hair free, carefree, niggas ain't near free
Enjoy your chains, what's your employer name with the hairpiece?
I survived the hood, can't no Shaytan rob me
My accountant's so good, I'm practically livin' tax free
Factory, that's me
Sold drugs, got away scot-free
That's a CC, E-copy
Guilt free, still me
And expect me to not feel a way to this day
You would say y'all killed me
Sucker free, no shuckin' me, I don't jive turkey
Say "Happy Thanksgiving," shit sound like a murder to me
Smoke free, all of y'all callin' out toll free
Label rob you for millions yet you wanna put a hole in me
Sugar free, seasoned but I'm salt free
You lay a hand on Hov, my shooter shoot for free
I promise World War Three
Send a order through a hands free
Kill you in 24 hours or shorter, you can't ignore the hand speed
On god, it's off the head, this improv but it's no comedy
Sign I fail? Hell nah
(Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha) Hahahahahahahahaha

[Intro]

[Chorus: PnB Rock]
You feel the vibe, it's contagious

Ooh, no we ain't perfect, but we damn close
Ooh, you give me something I can't pay for

No angel, but you got a halo

I really wanna take you there (you there, oh there)
When it's nights like this
I really wanna be right here (be right here)
I really wanna take you there (you there, baby, yeah, yeah)

[Verse 2: Meek Mill & Jeremih]
Uh, it was nights like this, feelin' right like this
I never really spent no time like this, huh
The second time at the crib knowin' I might not hit
You said, "What I look like?" Like my bitch, yeah
Look into your eyes, shit is dangerous
The pussy wet, I call it angel dust
I done put so many diamond chains on you, they get tangled up
I never felt like this, it's strange as fuck (that's what it's like loving you)
Got yo ex nigga calling, but he can't do much
'Cause you with the kid now, Ella Mai, boo'd up
And all you gotta do is call and watch that Wraith pull up
Under the stars since they throwin' all that shade on us
Facts, woo!

[Chorus: PnB Rock, Jeremih & Both]
You feel the vibe, it's contagious
Look in yo eyes, shit is dangerous (Your eyes)
Grateful I had all the patience, hey

Ooh, you give me something I can't pay for
That's what it's like loving you

[Verse 3: Meek Mill]
Uh, you feel the vibe, uh, I'm deep inside, yeah
You fuckin' me, ooh, I let you ride, yeah
At first you curved me, I let you slide in
Yo hips so curvy, you let me slide in
Ooh, and it was over once I flipped you over
Relation goal when we come through just like Beyonc', Hova
This that Hermes money, this ain't no Fashion Nova
You said yo ex had you depressed and I'm just glad that's over
'Cause now you rockin' with a real one
And when I'm in it, you be maxin' on a million
And when I hit it back to back, you make me still cum
I know them bitches hatin' on you, we gon' kill them
That's facts

[Chorus: PnB Rock, Jeremih & Both]
You feel the vibe, it's contagious
Look in yo eyes, shit is dangerous (Your eyes)
Grateful I had all the patience
I know you going through some changes
You taking pictures, know your angles
Ooh, no we ain't perfect, but we damn close
Ooh, you give me something I can't pay for
That's what it's like loving you

[Verse 4: PnB Rock & Jeremih]
Ayy, you know you bad babe
You know I laugh at these shawties that try to text back
You from the projects, but so exotic
Just give me all of that pussy, so many options (so many options)
Girl, you got me callin', all these different numbers
Why you being selfish? You know that I want you
You be leavin' work and you deserve a Birkin
Girl, you so contagious, damn that shit so dangerous

[Chorus: PnB Rock, Jeremih & Both]
You feel the vibe, it's contagious
Look in yo eyes, shit is dangerous
Grateful I had all the patience
I know you going through some changes
You taking pictures, know your angles
Ooh, no we ain't perfect, but we damn close
Ooh, you give me something I can't pay for
That's what it's like loving you

[Intro]
Sound M.O.B

[Verse 1: Meek Mill]
Woo!
I'm on my way to an island and I'm poppin' shit at the pilot (Fly shit only)
Niggas be broke and be starvin' but still talkin' shit like they violent (Niggas is broke!)
They said that they honest, talk money, these niggas gon' say that they got it (Huh?)
Gettin' out with the key to success and these niggas gon' blame it on Khaled
They don't wanna see you win (They don't!)
They don't wanna see the Wraith (No!)
You don't wanna see your bitch caught up in the stars like she outer space
Mansion at the condo, condo at the mansion, and I'm runnin' out of space
Tell your homie, keep on comin' out his mouth, I'm sendin' somethin' 'round his way (Brrt)
Niggas barely getting lawyer money (Woo)
Better get some Sig Sauer money
Running 'round like you Superman, don't be selfish, get your mom insurance money (Ha!)
Woo, 'cause I'm the one to put it on your money
I'm the one that make it happen it to you niggas, would you fuck around and do it for me?

[Chorus: Tory Lanez]
Yeah, hopped in the Wraith and I bought it, it's litty again
Fly out a bitch from the tropics, get litty again
All of my parties is poppin', you know that we litty again
All of the foreigns on Collins, you know that we litty again
They don't wanna see the squad (We lit)
They don't wanna see the Wraith (We lit)
They don't wanna see your bitch up in the stars like she goin' outer space
Litty again, litty again, I got it, we litty again (We lit)
Litty again, litty again, I got it, we did it, we litty again

[Verse 2: Tory Lanez]
Feature money out the safe, went and brought a Wraith, brought it down Collins
Niggas talkin' like they want it, when we in the city, they don't want problems
Niggas said they gon' rob us
But nigga, we comin' from welfare
I shoot a mullet when I pull it, how you catch a bullet like a NFL player?
Should've known it was litty when bitches start lyin' on my dick
Lie on that pussy like I hit
Can't even be a side, side bitch
I'm hittin' 9s, 10s, and you ain't even looking like you a 5
Broke bitches tryna do it for Twitter, when they used to do it for Vine, woah!
I'm the man of the hour, I'm the nigga with the airtime
Rolls Royce Wraith, put your bitch up in the stars like she in the airline
Niggas talkin' 'bout my hair line, I laugh about it, I be feelin' them
See, we both be making M's: they be makin' memes, I be makin' millions
I just counted up a Quentin Miller
A "QM," that's a quarter milli
They don't wanna see Jae drop "6," fly private when he go to Philly
Funny money, yeah I know it's silly, but your ho feel me
When I pull up and I got a pour a whole four on it
I promise she gon' know it's litty, motherfucker, yeah

[Chorus: Tory Lanez]
Yeah, hopped in the Wraith and I bought it, it's litty again
Fly out a bitch from the tropics, get litty again
All of my parties is poppin', you know that we litty again
All of the foreigns on Collins, you know that we litty again
They don't wanna see the squad (We lit)
They don't wanna see the Wraith (We lit)
They don't wanna see your bitch up in the stars like she goin' outer space
Litty again, litty again, I got it, we litty again (We lit)
Litty again, litty again, I got it, we did it, we litty again

[Verse 3: Meek Mill]
All of my niggas is way up
These niggas is haters, I know that they haters (Suckers)
I score your bitch like a layup (Score)
I make a mil' like a layup (More)
I pop a pill just to stay up (Woo)
I sip the lean just to slow it up (Slow it up)
I'm with my team, and we goin' up (Goin' up)
All of these foreigns, they know it's us (Ah!)
Whip it, whip it, whip it, whip it, whip it
Like the coca when we mix the soda up (Whip it)
Perfect timin' and we're blowin' up (Blowin' up)
Fuck it, I'ma light the Rollie up (Rollie up)
Shorty fuckin' for Chanel!
I ain't trippin', that's a coconut (Coconut)
Push the 'Rari 'til the motor bust
Stack the paper, fill the sofa up (Woo)
Lay on that paper, I am not slackin', I stay on that paper
I feel like it's a restraining order on that money, 'cause y'all stay away from that paper
I know some niggas that used to be ballin', but know they all feeling a way 'bout this paper
I be spending hundred, hundred, hundred after hundred
They thought I was makin' this paper!
Fuckin' it good, I be rapin' this paper
Shit, I might as well get married to money
I marry Nicki, still married to money
She rich as Mariah, I carry the money
And fuck a deposit, I bury the money (Bury them M's)
I bag the money, it hang out my pocket, embarrassin' money
I act like I ain't used to havin' this money, oh!

[Chorus: Tory Lanez]
Yeah, hopped in the Wraith and I bought it, it's litty again
Fly out a bitch from the tropics, get litty again
All of my parties is poppin', you know that we litty again
All of the foreigns on Collins, you know that we litty again
They don't wanna see the squad
They don't wanna see the Wraith
They don't wanna see your bitch up in the stars like she goin' outer space
Litty again, litty again, I got it, we litty again
Litty again, litty again, I got it, we did it, we litty again

God (Yeah)
Oh God, boi (Yeah)
G.O.O.D. (MMG, nigga)

[Verse 1: Meek Mill]
Chain all V.S. I ain't with the B.S.
Catch me in your city riding hard through the B-X
Skinny nigga but I do it large like a 3X
The last nigga tried to do me wrong, umm he checked
Right back to that money slinging O's in the p-jects
Or probably catchin' mileage while the pilot steer the P-Jet
Cause we next and we flex like...

[Verse 2: Big Sean]
90PX, working all night no breaks or a recess
Vroom vroom yeah I know my car sound like a T-Rex
Bitch, I'm 23 years old and I ain't riding in a Prius
My cousin finished school can't believe he graduated
Threw him 20,000 dollars told his ass congratulations
Cause me? I wasn't made for that shit
But I could probably hire him and who all paid for his shit
And to all the hoes that was dissin' I pray to God that you see me
I'm on a yacht getting hella' high smoking good that seaweed
Bad bitch in her cha-cha grabbing on her chi-chi's
Million dollar deals on my email you mad as hell you ain't CC'ed
Chain all V.S., bitch, you know it's B.S.
Boy, I run my city

[Verse 3: Meek Mill]
End of story, nigga P.S.
All white Maybach, Green Bay they packing
Y'all niggas was slackin', 'member the hard nights we trappin'
And they say life's a game of chess
You can play checkers all on my jacket
Cause it's Damier and we bombs away on y'all bitch rappers
I say yeah, nigga, I murder that, Panamera turtle back
Niggas say they want beef, well, where the fuck is my burger at?
I got white, was serving that, I been to jail, I ain't going back
I alley-oop your bitch off that backboard, she throw it back
I slam dunk in that pussy, Blake Griffin'd your ho, nigga
Maybach with Ricky Ross my chain rock like I know Jigga
That's cause I do, ho, shout out to my new ho
That pussy pink like Nuvo and I dog that; Cujo

[Chorus: Big Sean & Meek Mill]
Niggas wanna talk, what they gon' say? (gon' say)
I hit the pedal til that motherfucker break (til it break)
Freaky bitches love the money I make
And to live like this you motherfuckers gotta pay
So let that shit burn! Let that shit burn
I'ma let that shit burn, let that shit burn (Burn, gasoline!)
The roof on fire, I'm only gettin' higher
50 racks all in my pocket, I want bottles, I'ma let that shit burn

[Verse 4: Big Sean & Meek Mill]
Bitch, I had one shot and I ain't blow it
Riding til the wheels fall off and they tow it
I got green on top of green damn it's looking like I grow it
D-Town the hood behind me like a king cobra
Burn bitch, I let it burn bitch
My money straighter than a motherfucking perm, bitch
No navigation you can see it is my turn shit (swerve, swerve)
Shorty give me all that brain still ain't never learned shit

[Verse 6: Big Sean]
Oh that's your girl? Damn nigga, you ain't learn shit
She naked in my studio I'm on that Howard Stern shit
I swear that mac 10 is my barbell, Finally Famous the cartel
Hit your girl in my whip and now that pussy got the new car smell
Same shit, different day, I ain't broke no more, it's a different day
Don't turn me down, I got shit to say
My purp strong like it's lifting weights
It's Sean Don sippin' Chandon
I got a bad bitch with them pom pom's
My Rollie don't tick-tock, your shit sound like a time bomb
Boom! Lil' bitch

[Chorus: Big Sean & Meek Mill]
Niggas wanna talk, what they gon' say? (gon' say)
I hit the pedal til that motherfucker break (til it break)
Freaky bitches love the money I make
And to live like this you motherfuckers gotta pay
So let that shit burn! Let that shit burn
I'ma let that shit burn let that shit burn (burn, gasoline)
The roof on fire, I'm only gettin' higher
50 racks all in my pocket, I want bottles, I'ma let that shit burn
Let that shit burn
I'ma let that shit burn, let that shit burn (burn, gasoline)
The roof on fire, I'm only gettin' higher
50 racks all in my pocket, I want bottles, I'ma let that shit burn

[Verse 3: Meek Mill]

Niggas sellin' that China white

Ya'll niggas have boy scout dreams
Spend Iguodala on my Rolly
Young nigga ball like Kobe
Riding round me and Chino
And my young nigga Goldie
Hot whips you ain't seen though
Limo thats my Rolly
Two-eleven on yo bitch
Turn yo head she stolen

Ya'll niggas pussy like dyke hoes
All we know is get paid nigga
I ball hard like LeBron James
And Rozay D-Wade nigga

[Chorus: Rick Ross]
I got a a bad bitch in my Chevy

Hammers and the fucking vogues

[Chorus: Tory Lanez]
All I wanted was a new Mercedes
Bending off the corner whipping out the lot, I got it
Women love me but the niggas hate it
But how can I lose when I came from the bottom?
Lord knows
Nigga Lord knows, nigga Lord knows, nigga Lord knows
Nigga Lord knows, nigga Lord knows, nigga Lord knows
Nigga Lord knows, nigga Lord knows, nigga Lord knows

[Verse 1: Meek Mill]
Uh, Lord knows I'm filthy rich
All this ice is like 50 bricks
Rap niggas throwing hissy fits
I give my bitch a stack just for a Christmas gift
And my bitch so bad, she on my Christmas list
'Member I prayed, really I wished for this
To get the crib with the maid and with the picket fence
I'm with some niggas that mad, we taking risks for this
I'm talking risky business, flick the wrist
Lord knows that I repent for this
But Lord knows if I get penned for this
I prolly won't get home until I'm 56
They say I'm the Messiah, you rappers is liars
I sign up at church just to rap at the choir
To spit my new verse at your wake while you're lying
The middle of the church have you wake, no I'm lying
I just came from jail, ain't do no crying
They put me through hell, sharpened my iron
I did my push-ups and I roared with the lions
Like hold up, from balling I'm tired
I'm back in this bitch and I'm back on my shit
Man they tell me be humble, I'm cocky as hell
Shout out my bitches that answered my calls
When I called you collect cause it got me through hell
Shout out that judge that denied me my bail
It made me smarter and made me go harder
They locked me up and slowed my album up
But I did not give up cause I knew I would prevail
Came in the game, Philly as shit
Look at these rappers, they silly as shit
I do not know why they be gassing these suckers
But fuck 'em cause I am not feeling their shit
Difference between me and most of these rappers
I'm talking about work that I really put in
Talking about pistols I put on my hip
And I'm talking about foreigns I really could whip
That I really done drove
Really was froze in my hood and these bitches I really did hit
Really was chose, came up from nothing
And now they like, "How he made millions so quick?"
I'm in the back and it feel like a sofa
I done seen bitches I'm fuckin' on Oprah
In my new mansion I feel like I'm Sosa
A brick on the table ain't sniffing no coca, no way

[Chorus: Tory Lanez]
All I wanted was a new Mercedes
Bending off the corner, whipping out the lot, I got it
Women love me but the niggas hate it
But how can I lose when I came from the bottom?
Lord knows
Nigga Lord knows, nigga Lord knows, nigga Lord knows
Nigga Lord knows, nigga Lord knows, nigga Lord knows
Nigga Lord knows, nigga Lord knows, nigga Lord knows

[Verse 2: Meek Mill]
Uh, niggas can't see me with binoculars on
Back of the Maybach, shottas on
And all my niggas keep choppers on
Don't reach round me, that's a chopper zone
Every time you be on count, what the topic on?
250 thou what I dropped it on
See y'all think it's a game 'til FOX be on
CNN, momma picking out boxes for 'em
I want everything, got my own boxers on
Own headphones to get my popping on
I got my own Pumas that I designed 'em for 'em
Stick and moving on these niggas, get my boxing on
All I ever hear from niggas is what they prolly doing
But they be really talkin' 'bout what I be doing
All black Rottweiler, that Givenchy on
Drop top Rolls Royce but the top is on
And the windows down like see y'all later
Mirror tint on that bitch so you could see y'all hating
Champagne cork pop like we all made it
Ya'll looking from the sideline we all hate it
Money don't make it real
Don't give a fuck if its 80 mil, pussy
And just cause you got a Bentley
That Bentley won't make you thorough, pussy
Still hating me from my city
I'm thinking is they for real, pussies
Cause all I got to say is kill
They'll come in like Navy Seals
That's word to my momma, I promise I ain't doing no block
And we shoot at you robbers and kill all you fuck niggas talking
Lately I've been on this money
Don't run it back up just to come and put you in a coffin
I heard you said you was running this city
I seen you in traffic and you was just walking
Niggas be popping that shit like they with it
When niggas start hitting all you did was talk it, you pussy

[Chorus: Tory Lanez]
All I wanted was a new Mercedes
Bending off the corner, whipping out the lot, I got it
Women love me but the niggas hate it
But how can I lose when I came from the bottom?
Lord knows
Nigga Lord knows, nigga Lord knows, nigga Lord knows
Nigga Lord knows, nigga Lord knows, nigga Lord knows
Nigga Lord knows, nigga Lord knows, nigga Lord knows

[Intro]
See, it's brackets, nigga
Them hoes ain't fuckin' you
'Cause you ain't in that bracket, nigga
Learn life, it's levels to this shit, young boy
Ayy, O, you feel me?

[Chorus]
Lil' nigga, we don't rock the same clothes
Fuck the same hoes, 'cause it's levels to this shit
Lil' nigga, we don't drive the same whips
We don't fuck the same chicks, 'cause it's levels to this shit
Lil' nigga, we don't get the same paper
You a motherfuckin' hater, boy, it's levels to this shit
Lil' nigga, 'cause it's levels to this shit
Lil' nigga, 'cause it's levels to this shit'oh Lord!

[Verse 1]
'Cause it's levels to this shit, levels to this shit
Can't fuck my ho, 'cause it's levels to this bitch
And I be rockin' Prada like a devil in this bitch
And a Birkin bag like a gold medal to this bitch
And I'm heavy as it get
Shinin' like a motherfuckin' bezel on my wrist
All my niggas mobbin' so we heavy in this bitch
Thirty grand for the Muller, that's a Chevy on my wrist
Woo! Cocaine Mulsanne
Young nigga blowin' up; Kurt Cobain'boom!
Skatin' on them like I'm Lil Wayne
And this 458 don't do the lil' lane'vroom!
Swerve on 'em, niggas gotta nerve on 'em
'Cause I heard the feds got him and he had them birds on him
But a nigga back home and now niggas roll with him
Caught a case, what you think? Nigga fuckin' told on him
I ain't get my shit snatched yet
You ain't get your bitch back yet
One call, niggas aim that TEC
Blood drawn, headshot, nigga brains on step
Hot shit if you pop shit
And I don't want your opinion if you ain't got shit
We young niggas, we winnin', I pull up, drop shit
Mob shit, with more keys than a locksmith

[Chorus]
Lil' nigga, we don't rock the same clothes
Fuck the same hoes, 'cause it's levels to this shit
Lil' nigga, we don't drive the same whips
We don't fuck the same chicks, 'cause it's levels to this shit
Lil' nigga, we don't get the same paper
You a motherfuckin' hater, boy, it's levels to this shit
Lil' nigga, 'cause it's levels to this shit
Lil' nigga, 'cause it's levels to this shit'oh Lord!

[Verse 2]
Damn, Tommy, you ain't got no job!
DC, we the motherfuckin' mob
Young nigga gettin' straight to the money
In a Range with your honey, I pull up, like, "Ahh!"
I make them power moves with Jay and them
Them boys shootin', don't play with them
Maybach, Rozay and them
Rollin' down Collins, call Rugs, hit the A with them
Compound niggas live now
If it's the finals I'm ballin' like I'm LeBron now
I call up Onyx and tell them bitches to calm down
I treat the jet like a taxi the way I'm flyin' round
And I don't fuck with no niggas
If they don't fuck with my niggas
And I ain't fuckin' no bitches, if they fuckin' my niggas

[Chorus]
Lil' nigga, we don't rock the same clothes
Fuck the same hoes, 'cause it's levels to this shit
Lil' nigga, we don't drive the same whips
We don't fuck the same chicks, 'cause it's levels to this shit
Lil' nigga, we don't get the same paper
You a motherfuckin' hater, boy, it's levels to this shit
Lil' nigga, 'cause it's levels to this shit
Lil' nigga, 'cause it's levels to this shit'oh Lord!

[Verse 3]
One time for the real niggas
Two times for the bad bitches
Y'all suckas be cuffin' hoes
'Cause y'all suckas never had bitches
I hit the dealer, bought another Rolls
That's the reason why you mad, nigga?
That's the reason why you hatin' on me?
I love ballin''my bad, nigga
'Cause it's levels to this shit, levels to this shit
Can't fuck my ho, 'cause it's levels to this bitch
'Cause it's levels to this bitch
And a Birkin bag like a gold medal to this bitch
Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord, hold up!

[Chorus]
Lil' nigga, we don't rock the same clothes
Fuck the same hoes, 'cause it's levels to this shit
Lil' nigga, we don't drive the same whips
We don't fuck the same chicks, 'cause it's levels to this shit

You a motherfuckin' hater, boy, it's levels to this shit
Lil' nigga, 'cause it's levels to this shit
Lil' nigga, 'cause it's levels to this shit'oh Lord!

[Verse 1]
Started off poor with plans to own more
Now we own stores and fuck the baddest whores
I was on tour with niggas that sold raw
Started sellin' white, we won't sell it no more
I'm like, Trump ain't feelin' us, cops still killin' us
Niggas takin' shots, can't stop me, they ain't real enough
Cut her off, act like she's dead and it's killin' her
New Dawn, Hermes seat, I let the ceiling up
Just to kill 'em softly, ooh, get 'em off me
Try to crucify me like I'm Jesus the way she cross me
I'm too bossy and too thorough
To move like a weirdo, on point like an arrow
We started off with zero, now I'm seein' M's
Diamonds like water and they jumpin' out the gym
Shootin' like Harden if your head was the rim
'Cause niggas wanna line me like a shape up and a trim, damn
Back when I was broke, they was cool with it
Now every move I make I'm in the news with it
Even if I ain't do it they be like "You did it!"
My teacher always used to tell me "You gon' lose nigga!"
That's why I never went to school nigga
And why I'm rappin' like I got somethin' to prove nigga
Went and bought the mansion with the pool in it
Billy with the stamp, I get two with it
Move with it 'cause these niggas wanna take my life
No weapon formed against me every time I pray at night
Scoopin' thotties in the Phantom, that's the way of life
And make 'em fuck their best friends like they was dykes
Reachin' for the Glock every time I play the light
I'm on 12 o'clock every time I play them bikes
I'm with the pack, uh, gettin' back, yeah
Spendin' dope, nigga, sellin' smack, gang
I'm gettin' chips off music like Rap Snacks
Yeah, 10 mil in cash of Ethika, that's a fact
Money, power, respect, eatin' breakfast on a jet
I know these niggas upset, they ain't see me fall yet
Wins and losses!

[Chorus]
They wanna see me fall
And I will never sell my soul
I'm on some shit that they ain't seen before
Dream chasin', catchin' all my goals
I don't need these whores
I'm gettin' money, me and all my woes
Play with me, you know it's all-out war
The young niggas goin' all out for us

[Verse 2]
Bloggers in a frenzy, truck to the Bentley
Ain't doin' no interviews, I'm busy, nigga we litty
So when you see me out don't ask me about no Nicki
Fuck I look like tellin' my business on Wendy
Niggas gossip like queens, we was servin' fiends
.40 bust your windows out: Jazmine Sullivan
They told 'em pop Mollys, I told 'em to be kings
Sippin' 1942 like it's lean
I done seen all these niggas try to downplay my dreams
So I'ma give it to 'em every time I'm on the scene
Pull up Ghost Ghost, Wraith Wraith when you see me
Some suckers wanna be me and some suckers wanna leave me
I know it, I go through it, don't show it
I told niggas who wrote it, ain't takin' back what I quoted
Started off with a quarter, flipped that to a half
Turned that to an ounce, got some shit in the stash
Nigga say that he gon' rob me, put a brick on his ass
Now every killer in my city tryna look for his ass
And one thing 'bout Meek Milly, I'ma get to a bag
Had to starve all day just to get to it fast
Like Ramadan, totin' K's like it's Palestine
Real niggas in my ambiance, bottom line
Ever since I met Ross and signed the dotted line
I gave my momma 10,000 at least a thousand times
Do the math on it!

[Chorus]
They wanna see me fall
And I will never sell my soul
I'm on some shit that they ain't seen before
Dream chasin', catchin' all my goals
I don't need these whores
I'm gettin' money, me and all my woes
Play with me, you know it's all-out war
The young niggas goin' all out for us

[Verse 3]
Talkin', this my cocky flow
Damn Daniel, why you son him? Mr Miyagi though
This that rose gold Patek, call me like '94
Mean nothin' to me, I tell you how it gotta go
Rain, sleet, on that corner when the block was slow
Everybody was tryna trap, we started poppin' though
Heard that bitch say she cut me, I was like "'adi's!"
In the field, knock 'em down, it look like dominoes
Young nigga, I turned my Impala to a Wraith
When you get a dollar they gon' hate
Bought my mom the crib with that gate
Private school for all them babies, now they straight, nigga

[Chorus]
They wanna see me fall
And I will never sell my soul
I'm on some shit that they ain't seen before
Dream chasin', catchin' all my goals
I don't need these whores
I'm gettin' money, me and all my woes
Play with me, you know it's all-out war
The young niggas goin' all out for us

[Produced by Ben Billions]

[Chorus: Nicki Minaj]
You bring out feelings in me I never show
Nobody has made me feel this way before
I'm a good girl, but I wanna be bad for you
I wanna be bad for you
I wanna be bad-ad-ad
I wanna be bad for you
I wanna be bad

[Verse 1: Meek Mill]
And they say bad girls ain't no good
Good girls ain't no fun
I still can't find a nigga that touch that
I don't know one
And I ain't searching for it
Never trust but I'm working on it
Fell in love with that ride game
Swimming pool, you surfing on it
Like 'Yonce, do the surfboard, surfboard
They still think you a church girl
We linking up on your days off
And I still give you that work girl
Like work, twerk
Do it like that video
Wanted that for a long time
Cool with it, I get it though
First year we both fronted
We had feelings we didn't show
Second year we couldn't hide it
Funny part they didn't know
How could something that's so wrong feel so right?
But who to tell you this wrong, though? This your life
Word up

[Chorus: Nicki Minaj]
You bring out feelings in me I never show
Nobody has made me feel this way before
I'm a good girl, but I wanna be bad for you
I wanna be bad for you
I wanna be bad-ad-ad
I wanna be bad for you
I wanna be bad

[Verse 2: Meek Mill]
We just fucking up the city, going hard every night
Niggas hating on us, you know lord they ain't right
Cause I broke a lot of hearts, ain't do them girls right
But you broke hearts too, but that boy ain't fight
So they don't deserve it, it feel like it's perfect
I'm loving your style the way you preserve it
Just look at my eyes and see what's inside
You know that it's pride, you say that I'm worth it
But said I ain't ready, really I'm ready
Really I'm ready, I'm ready like never before
I'mma just give you a key to my heart
You'll be the first that I let in the door
I used to hear that you flirt with them guys
They never would score
All you was hearing about me and the women
Ain't trust them before
You know what you're doing, fuck what they said
You know what we on
When we in bed, it's like we on stage
And I got the mic so let me perform, sing it

[Chorus: Nicki Minaj]
You bring out feelings in me I never show
Nobody has made me feel this way before
I'm a good girl, but I wanna be bad for you
I wanna be bad for you
I wanna be bad-ad-ad
I wanna be bad for you
I wanna be bad

[Intro: DJ Drama]
Ayo, this the one? We all get caught in our own sins. Sometimes I have to remind myself, that on my worst day, I live like somebody on their greatest'and so do you. Don't let your demons take you to Hell. Introduce 'em to Heaven!

[Chorus: Gourdan Banks]
Some niggas go to college, some niggas go to jail
Some make it into Heaven, some make it into Hell
Nobody wanna lose, nobody wanna fail
Nobody wanna die, nobody wanna kill
The things we do just to make it through
But nobody wanna lose, nobody wanna fail
Nobody wanna die, we're just tryna live our life

[Verse 1: Meek Mill]
Look, I got homies in the ground, skeleton and bones
And niggas doin' life, they ain't never comin' home
They said I wouldn't make it or never see the throne
And my baby mama hate me 'cause she said I did her wrong
'Cause I left, to chase my dream, get it any means
I said that I'll be back, she wasn't listenin' to me
That back-and-forth arguin' was gettin' in between
I said fuck them other niggas, I go get it with my team
If we all grind, we all shine, fuck a part-time
I used to play the block early mornin' and dark time
Now it's G5 flights, fuck a depart time
It was hard times, nigga, now it's our time
Just take a look at my life, rappin' brought me back to life
'Cause I was in them streets, my heart was cold as a pack of ice
Every night we strappin' like we was in Iraq to fight
'Cause niggas gettin' murdered for a block that do a stack a night
Whoa, I got to make it home to my son
On them papers with a firm hold on his gun
Before I snitch they gotta burn a hole in my tongue
Give me a hundred years in a hole on the sun
In boilin' water, in the world of no order
In the hood, ain't no loyalty, ain't no world for your daughter
Ain't no life for your brother, on the life of my mother
I'ma get the fam right, nigga, you damn right!

[Chorus: Gourdan Banks]
Some niggas go to college, some niggas go to jail
Some make it into Heaven, some make it into Hell
Nobody wanna lose, nobody wanna fail
Nobody wanna die, nobody wanna kill
The things we do just to make it through
But nobody wanna lose, nobody wanna fail
Nobody wanna die, we're just tryna live our life

[Verse 2: Jadakiss]
Yeah, I used to pop a lot of shit, now I keep it moderate
These niggas know I been iced out, hoppin' outta shit
Right now I'm prayin' for my son to get this scholarship
A nice university, one of these black colleges
Far as the hood go, I acknowledge it
But whoever ain't a snake's usually a follower
Luckily, I can tell the difference
My man comin' home, my other man gettin' sentenced
Soft niggas usually send the hate through the bitches
Jealous Instagram niggas hatin' on your pictures
We dream-chasin', y'all niggas walkin' behind wishes
Without workin' for it, not often you find riches
Some niggas find coffins, others just find ditches
Just ask around 'bout the militia, they malicious
D-block, finish that and cop more dope
I'm two-stroke, you four-stroke
If you got enough cigars we can all smoke
Ain't nothin' all good when you all broke
So we could never be equal
Never bite the hand that'll feed you
Never fear a man if he bleed too
Some niggas need a headshot, some niggas need two
Play sweet in these streets and they'll leave you
You can't see the Devil, he's see-through

[Chorus: Gourdan Banks]
Some niggas go to college, some niggas go to jail
Some make it into Heaven, some make it into Hell
Nobody wanna lose, nobody wanna fail
Nobody wanna die, nobody wanna kill
The things we do just to make it through
But nobody wanna lose, nobody wanna fail
Nobody wanna die, we're just tryna live our life

[Intro: Meek Mill]
Location: Toronto; Status: five star hotel, Four Seasons. Them chumps right upstairs, they know not to come down here playin' no real niggas. Mood: I'm still up countin' five hundred thousand cash. Nicki in the bedroom sleep, life is good

[Verse 1: Meek Mill]
I've been in my cell for a week straight
Locked down 24, no more Philip's Steak
Damn, shit's so real it seems fake
Damn, let me take 'em to the green gate
When we was sellin' white girl
Audemar shinin' like it need a light bill
These niggas dick ride like they don't even like girls
A hundred thousand for the jet, yeah that's the flight bill
Damn, cost four bricks to go to the LIV nigga
Whole squad on some shit, that's how we live nigga
Twenty-five bad bitches what we did nigga
That's fifty different Louboutins bleedin' red nigga
Whew, I ain't blood and I ain't crippin' neither
On the phone with the plug talkin' Justin Bieber
I made a milly last week and I ain't touch it neither
Straight cash tryna give 'em straight gas
Catch you out in Brooklyn, get your chain tookin'
My Philly boys'll creep up on you when you ain't lookin'
With your lil memes, I be with the real queen
Screamin' free the real Preme, we be doin' real things
Pull up with a bad bitch, whippin' somethin' real mean
Marchin' all these fuckin' drums on me like a drill team
I be with my young niggas, all they know is kill things
Don't make me make a real scene, uh
See an OVO chain, probably take that shit
Said dreamin' wasn't enough, we had to chase that shit
You ain't write it' nigga, we caught ya, can't erase that shit
And you claimin' you HOV now? Why you state that shit?
Man I hate that shit, niggas be talkin' out they face
But soon as you body somethin' they be singin' like they Drake
Wait, niggas dancin' like they fruitcakes
Hotline Bling don't get no bing up in this new Wraith
Pull up on the plug, swap that bag with the suitcase
DC4 on the way, that's nigga's due date
Robbed you in your city and you told
Tory from the 6, you hatin' on him, Lord knows
Culture vulture, now it's time to pay the tolls
Soft as the lacrosse team, boy that's word to HOV
No reply, word to God I'm on the floor still
Me and Nicki watchin' the Sixers, I'm closin' more deals
Dreamchasers' double MG, we got the door sealed
Roc Nation, Atlantic Records, I'm on my fourth deal
When I met you, you was on my dick
Asked me to hold the DC chain, now you on some shit
Omelly told me get it back cause he's like "boy's a bitch"
And I'm like, let him get it took cause we gon' charge 'em trips

[Interlude: Meek Mill & Omelly]
Fuckboy, huh charge you triple the way this real nigga stamp. Chasers, ahh. Location: Philly; Mood: Glock with 30; Status: triple OG, never been disrespected without retaliation, chump

[Verse 2: Omelly & Meek Mill]
I've been in the hood for like a year straight
Sippin' dirty, it be hard for me to stand straight
Damn, it's time to cut the dead weight
I'm tryna turn my CLS into a red Wraith
When I was sellin' hard crack you was scared straight
I dropped 9 and bought the Rollie with the red face
Meek the one that got the mil, the one that got the deal
I'm still lampin' with the shooters and they poppin' pills
These niggas like to rap diss they get popped for real
It's time to son these pussy rappers, I'm their pop for real
I'm the type to fuck your mom cause she's a thot for real
And I ain't got one, my pump playin' shotgun
Quarterback that Glock, Cam Newton, and you catch a hot one
And for the fam I'll keep shootin' until the cops come
Reload, double back, hold up cuz, I got one
Official only respect official and you are not one
No, we are not them, we be on some other shit
Deep in them trenches, duckin' narcotics and the government
Tracin' the dollar, flippin' that product, tryna double shit
Chewing like it's double mint
Man, who you niggas fuckin' with?

[Outro: Omelly]
Hah, hey Meek Mill man, I'ma start running down on these niggas too. Real rap, these niggas soft and they frauds, check DC record nigga, we flawless. Any nigga stepped up to the fuckin' plate got rolled over. I ain't just talkin' to be talkin', nigga, check the resume. How many times we got to fuck the city up for you niggas to pay homage. Fuck you niggas talking bout nigga? Slide through 20 deep, I'm talkin' bout 7 Rolls Royces, 3 Maybachs, 20 Rollies, 30 Cubans, 25 bad bitches, 25 Chanel bags, 6 Caddie trucks, jumbo jets.

[Outro]
M-M-Maybach Music

[Intro]
R.I.P. to my lil' nigga Snupe (Rest in peace to a real nigga)
Yeah
We the realest niggas in this shit
Reporting live out of Philly
Young nigga loved popping bad bitches and wheelies
And I'm talking all this money, now these niggas can't feel me
Money long, team strong so these niggas can't kill me, ah

[Verse 1]
I get a rush from this lifestyle
Solid gold presidential with the ice dial
When the chasers in the building turn the lights down
'Cause every single nigga with me gon' be iced out
Glock 40, living life wild
I go to court for probation and looking like trial
The DA told me she want a nigga but right now
I'm living better than ever, I'm thinkin' like, "How?"
Is it the money? Is it the cars?
Is it the way a nigga living that took me this far?
But still they want me with the sins and give me them bars
They lock a nigga in the dark I still look like a star
I shine, I grind harder, I'm working my mind smarter
I take care of my grandmama, mama, my ma's daughter
They telling me I ain't shit, I made it for my father
I just hope you pray for me, matter fact sing for me

[Chorus]
Lil' Snupe, they killed my lil' nigga Snupe
My lil' nigga was the truth
And all he wanted was a coupe, all he wanted was a coupe
So what's a nigga 'sposed to do?
Tell 'em put the guns down or tell these lil' niggas shoot?
'Cause they'll do the same to me, do the same shit to you
And all these niggas in my roof, that's why I got a bulletproof

[Verse 2]
And as I'm rolling through my city, nigga, all I see is murder
Ain't nobody seen it but shit everybody heard it
And ain't nobody hiring so everybody serving
And all this gunfire and shit everybody murkin', better get a strap
Young niggas selling 'caine just to get it back
And they busting out them things 'til they sitting back
And if a nigga hit my homie, we gon' hit him back
And if you send him over here, know we gon' send him back
My flow iller, I came up from dope dealing
I been sayin' I'd make it, they telling me no
Nigga these voices all in my head just telling me go get it
I came up on four wheelers, bananas and gorillas
Through the jungle where killers rumble and everyone perishing
Realest nigga in it no comparison
And they got the nerve to tell me that I'm arrogant
But what the fuck, I'm young black, I made it in America
So I'ma ball harder than the mahfucking Carters
Beyonc' and Shawn, arm bluer than their daughter
Maneuver through the water like a shark that's on a dolphin
Nigga darker in a coffin, Devil on him, get 'em off, hah
I can look at your homies and tell you foul, dawg
Leaning with your left but you still a southpaw
Be the same niggas that'll take you out, dawg
Leaving niggas hungry but you eating Mr. Chow's, dawg?
Where the love at? Where the love at?
I'd give up all this money to get lil' cuz back
Just for my nigga, go starving, like, "Where the grub at?"
Give up the fame, start over and get my buzz back
Do it again, murder his killer, him and his friend
Put the arena, step on the stage, kill him again
Look at the stands, the fans coming, filling them in
To give my nigga a chance, see him winning again

[Chorus]
Snupe! They killed my lil' nigga Snupe
My lil' nigga was the truth
And all he wanted was a coupe, all he wanted was a coupe
So what's a nigga 'sposed to do?
Tell 'em put the guns down or tell these lil' nigga shoot?
Cause they'll do the same to me, do the same shit to you
And all these niggas in my roof, that's why I got a bulletproof

[Outro]
Real nigga for life!
Real nigga for life!
Real nigga for life!
They killed my lil' nigga Snupe!
Killed my lil' nigga Snupe

[Produced by Allen Ritter, Boi-1da & Vinylz]

[Chorus]
You fuck around get smoked
You fuck around, you fuck around, you fuck around get smoked
Nigga, you fuck around get smoked

[Verse 1: Meek Mill]
Uh, niggas know the rules in my hood
If you touch me you get murked
We ain't with that back and forth, it ain't no rap, we hittin' first
G-5, we be at LIV by Sunday when you in the church
Momma stressin', sellin' dinner platers
Tryna get your casket and get ya hearse
Last nigga that slid on us got dropped on it, he told on us
Every nigga you see with me got ice on 'em, bank rolls on us
Naw nigga, no 1 on 1's, we don't fight fair, we just roll on 'em
V-S stones and Cuban links, all that ice wear with that gold on 'em
We ain't swingin' no flag, nigga
We ain't need no pass, nigga
Glock 40 with a 30 clip and a laser on it, play tag with us
Everybody wanna talk bricks
'Til them feds swoop in and grab niggas
Dream Chasers got into somethin'
We don't ever blink 'cause we trash niggas
I don't know if y'all heard 'bout what my homie do with that 30 out
Deen Buck still in the cut and the state fittin' to let Ernie out
I ain't even gotta say nothin'
'Bout that other homie that you heard about
'Cause if he heard about that you run your mouth
He come to your house and start swervin' out
Catch me N-Y-C, out Shadyville, I'm in the tank
Only time it's Manhattan when I'm in the booth or I'm in the bank
Summertime in La Marina with Dominicans goin' in the paint
Pullin' up, screamin', "Eh, Dimelo'?"
Catch you in Brooklyn, get pita-rolled, pussy!

[Chorus]
You fuck around get smoked
You fuck around, you fuck around, you fuck around get smoked
Nigga, you fuck around get smoked
You fuck around, you fuck around, you fuck around get smoked
(Yeah! Ayy, Meek, whattup? Bang! Oh, man in Chiraq)

[Verse 2: Lil Durk]
Niggas say me and Sosa beefin'
But we both eatin', but only one keepin'
Told Law he take 15 years
Every crime we did we gon Keep It Secret
Can't tweet Teyana, corporate nigga lookin'
So what I'm on I gotta keep it secret
That face no Stevie no Mimi, I promise Teyana that I won't leak it
Gripped the 30, just cashed out
If you caught strippin' then you assed out
I'm the same nigga my city asked about
While you in the cut steady buyin' clout
Fuck the judge, let 9 out, hairpin trigger, let 9 out
Four birds in the trap like four wings at Harold's
With fries covered in mild sauce
Everytime a nigga rap beef, get clapped up in a couple weeks
IG comments and a couple tweets
Location on, we can go and meet
Headshot, I'm outta town, I'm in Killadelphia with my nigga Meek
Pop a wheelie in N-Y-C, I got the 30 on with my nigga Flee
Heard Tyga sneak dissin' on me, tell them thot bitches I'm not right
Tyga only got one name, but that nigga ain't got one stripe
He backpack, so easy to get the nigga shit snatched
Ask Mally Mall to get his shit back
In Chiraq, don't come here
You ain't from here? Don't come here
'Cause shorty snipin', bag on him if he don't like this
No Young Chop, that .40 bangs just like him
30 punch like Tyson
Back to the rap flow, hot shit
Fuck I gotta rap for, got bricks
Every city I go, got sticks
Pockets Wells Fargo, no bricks
Say I'm on top now, no shit
You can never say I wife shit
I don't even like shit, I just pipe shit, one night shit
L.A. with killas and thuggers
New York SlowBucks, them my brothers
A-T-L with Migos and Young Thugger
We gon' shoot shit up in public
And they gotta urge to take
Chiraq, look at the murder rate
500 dead bodies, better go and get money 'fore you be on first 48

[Verse 3: Shy Glizzy]
You wear red bottoms and Phillip Lim
Everybody tryna get a hold of him
Bad bitches they be in Benz
I knock 'em down like bowling pins
Feds snatch me, I don't know them
Real nigga on 4nem
Young Jefe, the new Soulja Slim
Hangin' out the tank with Slow and them
Come take a trip to D.C.
Hear a lot of Me and see GG
I'm the big dog, I'm ringin' off
Like Mambo Sauce on a 3 piece
'Glizzy, why you ain't D.C.?"
Who said I ain't D.C.?
Fuck ya bitch to my CD
She let me record her like Mimi
A nigga playin', it's lights out
Ooh, shine got me iced out
Stay low 'cause the mice out
You only get fly when the Mikes out
Can't wait 'til it get nice out
Tell Chino bring the bikes out
Got 50 guns in my trap house
You better off fuckin' with the White House
I'm the realest youngin' in the fuckin' world
I got plenty money, I got plenty girls
Got a villa for the week, got fifteen freaks
And they all wanna go for a fuckin' swirl
Had her come to us with the marble pearls
Glock 23, treat her like my girl
357, that bitch just twirl
Make him catch our shit like Fitzgerald

[Chorus]
You fuck around get smoked
You fuck around, you fuck around, you fuck around get smoked
Nigga, you fuck around get smoked
You fuck around, you fuck around, you fuck around get smoked

[Intro: Snowy White]
This is my blues
'Cause I'm back down on my own again
This is the blues I'm playing
Yes, it's a fine old thing
When the night is cold and lonely
(This is a Dollar Bill beat)

[Verse 1: Meek Mill]
Was it the money that made me a savage?
Poppin' them Percs and I made it a habit
Totin' them pistols and serving them addicts
That was exciting to me, I'm so excited to be
Started with nothin', we had to inspire to be
Niggas ain't flyer than me, I'm getting to it
Feel like the man, I got the plan
I call the shooters, they hop out the van
Play with the squad, get popped like a Xan
Pop like a Perc, I'm goin' ham
I'm goin' crazy on niggas, too wavy for niggas
Do magic like alakazam
I'm in the kitchen compressin' a birdie
Take out a nine and I sell it for thirty
Then straight to the jeweler, I'm bustin a Rollie
To light up the city like Meechie in '03
I got the plug, he send 'em OT
Don't know these niggas, these niggas know me
Even old niggas, they call me OG
Young nigga but I put it down
We was on it when it weren't 'round
All of sudden niggas wanna come around
Stay over there, my G

[Interlude: Meek Mill & Snowy White]
This is my blues
Do me one favor, take a few steps back
'Cause I'm back down on my own again
And look at yourself
Matter fact, take yourself outside your body
And then look at yourself
And see how you playing yourself, nigga
This is the blues I'm playing
Congratulations, it's the motherfuckin' Chasers
Yes, it's a fine old thing
You feel me? We on it
When the night is cold and lonely

[Verse 2: Meek Mill]
Gave you the plug
Try to be real with some niggas and put 'em on money
And show 'em some love
You did me a favor, I knew you was sheisty
I knew you would show who you was
It's only a matter of time before niggas get lined
And hit with them slugs
Get found in a pool of your blood, yeah, nigga
'Member they told me that we would fail
'Member they said we would see a cell
Down with that semi like Cam Newton
I'm in the field like the NFL
Niggas is sick' and I wish em well
I made a wish in a wishing well
I put a brick in a wishing well
Been through some shit and I'm sick of jail
No disease but I'm sick of cells
Sick and tired of sending niggas mail
Calling niggas just to get a bail
I just seen a nigga get a L
Never coming homeand minute on the phone
Sick and tired of seeing niggas fail
Sick and tired of seeing niggas lose
Sinning like we tryna get to hell

[Outro: Snowy White]
This is my blues
'Cause I'm back down on my own again
This is the blues I'm playing
Yes, it's a final thing
When the night is cold and lonely

[Bridge: Future]
I just took a perc now I'm on another level
Tasting on the molly got me dancing with the devil
Poured a 8th of Kobe Bryant mixing purple with the yellow
Got these racks on me, now it's hard to keep this shit together

[Chorus: Future]
Jump out the Rari then jump out the Wraith
Then I hop in Margiela then hop in some Bape
They jump out the face, they jump out the face
Money gon' stack and this money gon' fall though

[Verse 1: Meek Mill]
Came from the hood now we jump out of states
Peep all these diamonds, they jump out the face
Ducking indictments and selling this white
Got to watch for these niggas they'll jump on your case
(You watch all these niggas, these niggas be playing)
And none of this money don't come out the safe
Fuck with my dawg, knock a chunk out ya face
Nigga I be so high, I could jump out to space
What the fuck did I say?

[Verse 2: Future]
I be so fly, just don't shoot my cape
Went and bought me a safe and it came with a Wraith
Got some new money, went and bought me a K
You see all them VV's jump out the face
Put that dope in the trap and cook up me a cake
We fly to Cuba to fuck up some mula
Pour up some pour up, my nigga we boolin'
Young nigga pull up in Bentleys just boolin'
I'm taking your ho from you cause she was choosy
I keep them shooters on deck, I approve it
Get me a truck of them things, I'll move it
VVS cuts on my wrist suicidal
I stay lit up with that flawless on fire
I spend it all with my niggas, let's get it
Get out your feelings, young nigga let's get it
I got stars on my ceiling

[Chorus: Future]
Jump out the Rari then jump out the Wraith
Then I hop in Margiela then hop in some Bape
They jump out the face, they jump out the face
Money gon' stack and this money gon' fall though

[Verse 3: Meek Mill]
I've been, peeping you niggas been watching my moves
Watching my stacks and my shoes
When everybody did the Gucci and Louis
We was on Jimmy Choos
2012 when we did the Giuseppes
Margielas was cool
When you lil niggas was worried about Jordans
We was rocking them Loubs
If I got to lose it's not by the rules
Get hit with that chopper knock right out your shoes
Shawty so proper she look like a goddess
When I dip inside her it's just like a pool
I bought some Rarris and I bought some Phantoms
And then dropped out the seat like I dropped out of school
Still will pull up on you hop out with goons
Thirty-two shots let it pop out the tool

[Bridge: Future]
I just took a perc now I'm on another level
Tasting on the molly got me dancing with the devil
Poured  8th of Kobe Bryant mixing purple with the yellow
Got these racks on me now its hard to keep this shit together

[Chorus: Future]
Jump out the Rari then jump out the Wraith
Then I hop in Margiela then hop in some Bape
They jump out the face, they jump out the face
Money gon' stack and this money gon' fall though

[Hook]
The money turned me into a monster (Hah!)
The money turned my noodles into pasta (Hah!)
The money turned my tuna into lobster (Whoa!)
They want to do me, I maneuver like a mobster, whoa!

[Verse 1]
4 A.M., I'm on the north side of Philly
Riding around like these haters don't want to kill me
It's a shame how they hate on me, you gotta feel me
I started out with a dollar and got a milli
Jahlil Beats, holla at me!
I'm like, "Do it for the gram, ho! Do it for the gram, ho!"
She don't want to bust it, I say, "Do it for them bands, yo!"
I say, "Do it for them bands"
Fucking with that broke nigga, you should do it for your man
Lately, I've been on the low with a ho that you probably know
Took her to the crib and met momma right at the door
Momma started smiling like, "Momma, I gotta go"
I done took so many trophies to momma
My momma know her son a real nigga
I get that money, pay them bills, nigga
My momma told me, "You a real nigga"
And I be hanging with them real killers
Now, what a feeling
When you looking at the latest whip and knowing you can cop it
Or looking at the baddest bitch and knowing you could pop it
The youngest nigga in my city doing it, I got it
On that other line with Benjamin, and money is the topic, Lord!

[Hook]
The money turned me into a monster (Hah!)
The money turned my noodles into pasta (Hah!)
The money turned my tuna into lobster (Whoa!)
They want to do me, I maneuver like a mobster, whoa!

[Bridge]
I put my jeweler on his feet (On his feet)
Hundred thou, I used to do that every week (Every week)
Never sleep, it's funny how it never speak (Never speak)
You see a foreign in my city, that was Meek, whoa!

[Verse 2]
That was us, never sweet (Never sweet)
We went to war, niggas riding down the street (Brr-r-r!)
Popping that pistol they talking they never deep (Never deep)
Dropping that nickel out something with leather seats
I've been sitting on that money like a chair (Like a chair)
I've been getting to that money all year (All year)
All year and my niggas all here
But we started from the bottom, we was selling hard squares
Baddest bitch in the game wearing my chain, I'm ready
Switching lanes in that Mulsanne like Andretti (Skrt!)
I do the Balmain, Balenciaga, no Giuseppe
If they sleep on Meek Milly, I kill these niggas like I'm Freddy, oh!
I eat that pussy like a monster (Monster)
She gon' ride the dick, she need a sponsor (Ah!)
You could tell I'm Philly from my posture (You know!)
And we be whipping coca like it's pasta, whoa!
I be all money (All money)
Two milli, four milli'no, I need more money (More money)
I get that "see a bad bitch and be like, 'How you doing?'" money
They like, "How you doing, honey?" OH!

[Hook]
The money turned me into a monster (Hah!)
The money turned my noodles into pasta (Hah!)
The money turned my tuna into lobster (Whoa!)
They want to do me, I maneuver like a mobster, whoa!

[Bridge]
I put my jeweler on his feet (On his feet)
Hundred thou, I used to do that every week (Every week)
Never sleep, it's funny how it never speak (Never speak)
You see a foreign in my city, that was Meek, whoa!

[Verse 1]
It really hurt me when they killed Shaddy
I was locked down in my cell and I had to read about it
And when they killed Diddy, left him out in Philly
We was young and gettin' money, man we used to run the city
We was rockin' all them shows, fuckin' all them hoes
And when they killed Darryl, Renee had to see him froze on the ground
Downtown, I can hear the sounds now
When she walked up to that casket seen her son and fell down
I drop tears for my niggas that ain't here
And still think about you even though that it been years
'Cause half the niggas that I grew up with is all dead
All this pain and all this stressin' I should have a bald head
'Cause when my Aunt Rhonda died she looked Tak in his eyes
Saw death comin', when she seen it she just cried
Prolly part of the reason we drink and we get high
When I find the nigga that killed my daddy know I'ma ride
Hope you hear me, I'ma kill you nigga
To let you know that I don't feel you nigga
Yeah, you ripped my family apart and made my momma cry
So when I see you nigga it's gon' be a homicide
Cuz I was only a toddler, you left me traumatized
You made me man of the house and it was grindin' time
So I'ma let this flame hit you just to let this pain hit you
And for all them cloudy days I'ma let this rain hit you nigga

[Chorus: Meek & Bill Withers]
I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know
You ripped my family apart and made my momma cry
So when I see you nigga it's gon' be a homicide
I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know
So I'ma let this flame hit you just to let this pain hit you
And for all them cloudy days I'ma let this rain hit you nigga

[Verse 2]
And I ain't ready
Niggas wanna murder me I'm ridin' around heavy
I think they wanna wet me like New Orleans and the levees
But I got this Mac-Elev-y, these niggas'll never get me
Lord knows, I got alotta homies in the dirt
Niggas sprayin' metal tryna take you off the earth
Really over nothin', tell me what it's worth
Tryna take you out the game just to put you on a shirt
I rose from the jungle like Derrick
Death to anybody that oppose my spirit
My future looking brighter than this rose I'm staring at
We be runnin' trains on the hoes y'all cherish
Rest in peace to my niggas, I swear I miss them to death
My hammer sing murda music, I'll let you listen to death
I'll have you walk with the reaper when hollows rip through your chest
'Cause if you throw 'em I throw back like Mitchell & Ness
I'm gone

[Chorus: Meek & Bill Withers]
I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know
You ripped my family apart and made my momma cry
So when I see you nigga it's gon' be a homicide
I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know
So I'ma let this flame hit you just to let this pain hit you
And for all them cloudy days I'ma let this rain hit you nigga

[Verse 3]
Man my life so real
Last night I went to sleep and woke up with the chills
Started with a dollar now I got a couple mil
And I make a hundred thousand every time a nigga spill
Man I almost got murked in front of the same church
My dad got carried in, family got married in
That was in my older days, this is now, that was then
Had the block jumpin' for them dollars, Shawn Marion
Young nigga gon' get my own that's why I'm arrogant
Homie need the bail, for them bonds we'll bury 'em
Lock 'em like a terrier, breakin' all barriers
Just to beat the trial we go miles like Darius
'Cause cops tryna catch me, niggas tryna clap me
Haters runnin at me, know they wanna get at me
And people got the nerve to ask why I don't look happy
I did it for my niggas, and I did this shit for Kathy

[Chorus: Meek & Bill Withers]
I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know
You ripped my family apart and made my momma cry
So when I see you nigga it's gon' be a homicide
I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know
So I'ma let this flame hit you just to let this pain hit you
And for all them cloudy days I'ma let this rain hit you nigga

Oxycontin fucking up kidneys

[Verse 1: Young Thug]
Molly, my cup look like bath salt
And I'm too high horsed for asphalt
Therefore I'm in clouds from day to dark
They say that I changed, it's the cash fault
Pay everybody like a cash cow
I switch through the lanes like a NASCAR
The Rollie stainless, stainless
We young and rich and we dangerous
I'm at Piccadilly's with your missus, nigga
And the weed stinking like a chitlin, nigga
The money long like a Philly, nigga
Make me catch you slipping then it's Christmas, nigga
The bulletproof can take a missile, nigga
I got Benji on me and he crippin' nigga
I done wrapped the benji in the city, ho
I done wrapped the Bentley in the bity, nigga
Put a swimming pool in the living room
How I'm living, nigga, I ain't swimming, nigga
Only thing that me and Michael Phelps
Got in common is that we winning nigga
Rock star lifestyle
Your hoe's going wild

[Verse 2: Meek Mill]
Saint Laurent shorty and toting that .40
We move through the city like BMF
Rocks on the chain like the rocks that I slang
Only difference them bitches, they VVS
I know these bitches gon' change
And fuck on whoever, whenever they see a check
If you do not fuck with the gang
Don't act like you do, when you see us just keep it that
Swing through your block, bring that sweeper back
Land on your spot where your peoples at
Smoke you where ever we see you at
You don't want no problem so keep at that
'Fore you get your man murdered
Hitters in the van lurking
I put bread on the beef (what you do?)
Turn it to a hamburger
Put that paper on the scale, nigga
Little homies talking big money
When the wars on you'll tell, nigga
Put a bag on your main hitta
When them things hit 'em, that's an L nigga
So you should be home before mama got dinner for sale, nigga
And that's all I'ma tell niggas, and that's it

[Chorus: Young Thug]
Yeah, yeah
Fuck is you talkin' 'bout? Bitch, you offending me (fuck is you talkin' 'bout?)

[Intro]
(Dougie on the beat)

[Chorus]
I fell in love with these streets, I seen a hundred thou
Started fuckin' bad bitches, I went runnin' wild (gone)
I just pray Papi forgive me, ain't seen my son a while (I pray)
I go and pick him up from school to see him fuckin' smile (facts)
Somebody save me, save me
Tryna please a bitch, it almost drove me crazy
I was breakin' bread with niggas that was shady
I said I would never change, but shit it changed me
Somebody save me, save me
Twenty-three and one, it almost drove me crazy
In a cell all alone, can't let it phase my
I just wanna make it home to see my baby


[Verse 1]
I fell in love with these streets, I seen a hundred thou
Bustin' choppers, sellin' dope, I went to runnin' wild
Threw a drum up in my forty, shoot a hundred times
Two hundred thou my cousin's case to see his daughter smile
Somebody save me, save me
All this lean and all these percs gon' drive me crazy
I see niggas switchin' sides like they KD
I can't let it kill my vibe 'cause I'm too wavy
This what I wanted, I'ma own it
Anything I ever said I'm standin' on it
Got my dog in the feds, he turned informant
I just pray that he don't say some shit to harm us

[Chorus]
I fell in love with these streets, I seen a hundred thou
Started fuckin' bad bitches, I went runnin' wild (gone)

Somebody save me, save me
Twenty-three and one, it almost drove me crazy
In a cell all alone, can't let it phase me
I just wanna make it home to see my baby

[Verse 2]
One time my dog tried to line me, must've lost his mind
When he know how we get down when niggas cross the line
And I hate to be the one that gotta call his mom
That money mix up with that greed, it happen all the time
If I can't trust you, it's fuck you
Know that money ain't a thang, I tell 'em touch you
Know them boys gon' bust your brain, I push a button
To make it home to see me son, know I'm gon' crush you
'Cause that's important, to keep it one hundred
I just wanna make it home to see my youngin (Papi)
Move my family out the ghetto all I wanted
Left me dancin' with the devil, chasin' this money
Amen

[Chorus]
I fell in love with these streets, I seen a hundred thou
Started fuckin' bad bitches, I went runnin' wild (gone)

Somebody save me, save me
Tryna please a bitch, it almost drove me crazy
I was breakin' bread with niggas that was shady
I said I would never change, but shit it changed me
Somebody save me, save me
Twenty-three and one, it almost drove me crazy
In a cell all alone, can't let it phase me
I just wanna make it home to see my baby

[Verse 3]
And I'm so tired of makin' moves and gotta keep the tool
Gotta hide it from my son, I pick him up from school
With them papers with it, some would tell me I'm a fool
But all these hatin' niggas wanna see me on the news
And they debating on a nigga if I'm gon' win or lose
'Bout this paper I seen real niggas forget the rules
And I can't trust these bitches, I know they gon' pick and choose
No I can't trust these bitches, I know they gon' pick and choose
Amen

[Chorus]
I fell in love with these streets, I seen a hundred thou
Started fuckin' bad bitches, I went runnin' wild (gone)
I just pray Papi forgive me, ain't seen my son a while (I pray)
I go and pick him up from school to see him fuckin' smile (facts)
Somebody save me, save me
Tryna please a bitch, it almost drove me crazy
I was breakin' bread with niggas that was shady
I said I would never change, but shit it changed me
Somebody save me, save me
Twenty-three and one, it almost drove me crazy
In a cell all alone, can't let it phase me
I just wanna make it home to see my baby

[Intro: Meek Mill]
There's three types of niggas in life
Niggas that make it happen
Niggas that watch it happen
And niggas that don't even know what the fuck is going on
Choose one...

[Verse 1: Meek Mill]

Pull up on the curb so crazy, I done bent the door

Out in Philly in a condo, boss shit
Now they call me Young Oprah; Harpo
In the pool rockin' polo, Marco
Millionaires, never do leers
No, they can't see me, they're never my peers
Fruits of my labor, go get me my pears
Cause you're outta your element; I am your fear
So go get off my testicle, pardon my decimal, bitch!
Check up my resum', I'm upper echelon rich
Them bikes is out and we throwing 'em up like we sick
My clothing line is out in them stores and I'm sipping a Myx, bitch!

Flamboyant dough boy, talkin' Al Capone (ROZAY!)

[Outro: Beyonc']
End
What I found out-
I took a vow that from now on
I'm gonna be my own best

[Verse 1]
Stuntin' all on my old hoes, styling all on my haters
Presidential is rose gold, say it's time to get paper
Glock 10 with that laser, fuck around meet yo maker
Every month got me pissin', fuck around with them papers
So I can't smoke no kush, I can't smoke no kush
But I ran through them hoes, and I ain't talk 'bout Reggie Bush
I say y'all fuck niggas so fold, hoes ain't never gon' look
In the kitchen with that pyrex and a 9 piece, let me cook
Now hold up, I went and bought a Phantom cause I wanted to
And now I drive the same one some stunnas do
Real nigga, 100 proof
I'ma need a 100 M's to make me comfortable

[Chorus]
Stuntin' all on my old hoes, styling all on my haters
Presidential is rose gold, say it's time to get paper
Big crib with no neighbors, ball hard but no Lakers
Spent a 100 racks on my chain, all them hoes know my name
I be flexin', flexin', flexin' on these niggas
I be flexin', flexin', flexin' on these bitches
I be flexin', flexin', flexin' on these niggas
I be flexin', flexin', flexin' on these bitches

[Verse 2]
All I know is just flex, shittin' on my ex
Bad hoes on my team, dick 'em down like Next
I rock YSL so fresh, fly as hell no jet
Waves on 360, make that pussy get so wet
She say I'm cocky, I say that's not me
She call me papi and I say ven aqui
Wrist wear on hockey, Porsche box like Ali
My sneaks they bally, in my hood I'm prolly just rollin 'round in that ghost
Watching out for them folks
Heater on my hip, trunk full of that work
I say my shooters like Dirk, 10 racks and you murk
I put that on yo head nigga, first week and you dead nigga
I bottle pop, I model pop
Pull up on them bikes, let the throttle pop
Niggas know I'm nice, and I got a lot
Like fuck yo corner, I buy the block

[Chorus]
Stuntin' all on my old hoes, styling all on my haters
Presidential is rose gold, say it's time to get paper
Big crib with no neighbors, ball hard but no Lakers
Spent a 100 racks on my chain, all them hoes know my name
I be flexin', flexin', flexin' on these niggas
I be flexin', flexin', flexin' on these bitches
I be flexin', flexin', flexin' on these niggas
I be flexin', flexin', flexin' on these bitches

[Verse 3]
I don't chase no bitches, I just chase my dreams
We ridin' 'round so dirty in this whip that's so clean
My old head, she 30 but that dick suck so mean
And that pussy just so good for that pipe, she my fiend
On that pint I just lean, perk got me bent
If you ain't talking 'bout money, you ain't got no sense
Smell it on my clothes, work got that scent
In that kitchen with them birds, 'bout to serve up that's din' - Hold up!
OZ's and whole keys, straight white and no trees
Great white and OZ's and they might just OD
I stay tight with OG's, they know I'm real nigga
Pocket full of them racks and my bank account, Meek Mill nigga

[Chorus]
Stuntin' all on my old hoes, styling all on my haters
Presidential is rose gold, say it's time to get paper
Big crib with no neighbors, ball hard but no Lakers
Spent a 100 racks on my chain, all them hoes know my name
I be flexin', flexin', flexin' on these niggas
I be flexin', flexin', flexin' on these bitches
I be flexin', flexin', flexin' on these niggas
I be flexin', flexin', flexin' on these bitches

[Intro: Meek Mill]
Yeah!
R.I.P. Dex Osama, Lil Snupe
All the fallen soldiers
Scooter, Truce

[Verse 1: Meek Mill]
When they killed my nigga Snupe, I seen my young nigga
In the casket he ain't even have no blood in him
Prolly the reason why I keep taking these drugs quicker
Ain't got no patience for these motherfuckin' fuck niggas
I watch everybody change, they thought I lost it
But now they all bustin' U-ies its gon' cost 'em
I seen Chino shut the casket on the coffin (Truce)
Killed his only big brother and we lost him
So I'ma hold it down 'til we all win
We've been at the Clearport ballin'
I just want to see my niggas flossin'
Hundred bands everytime I walk in
If you keep it trill you'll get a blessing for it
Deep down in the trenches with that Wesson on me
My mama, she can't sleep, I come here early mornings (mama)
But mama I got thirty in this dirty .40
Any weapon formed against me shall not prosper
Used to pray them Ramen noodles turned to lobster
Gotta watch my own homies on the roster
Cause this the type of money'll get your lined up

[Bridge: Meek Mill]
And I can't trust nobody
They hit your homie and they knocked the soul out him
They said that they would ride or die but ain't nobody roll 'bout it
Three felonies, ain't graduate, no I am not your role model
I hope the Lord got us

[Verse 2: Young Thug]
When they killed my nigga, I seen the footage on the tape
Man I must've threw up everything I ever ate
Man I know he got some dice at the Heaven gates
Kicking shit with all these bitches like he's Kevin Gates
Relax your mind and kick your feet way up
Selling dog food tryna feed my pups
Young rich nigga and I'm built Ford Tough
And I'm going through stuff
I don't feel no love
I shake your body and you still wake up
Taking Perkys, man I fill my cup
The feds watching and they still might come, I'm gone
I wan' see my brother with the Patek, not the static
Gucci wrap your toe up, got retarded with my daddy
All they seen was red bottoms bleeding by the casket
Perkys got me focused, I done noticed all the damages
I don't see no purpose, in the county eating sandwiches
Lost so many niggas, I went crazy, I couldn't balance it
You can't question God, yeah, yeah, and then there's challenges
Sipping on this Actavis, I swear, I gotta manage it
SRT the challengers
Make that work do acrobatic flip, accurate
And I'm leaning like a project banister
I'm a boss, I ain't never need a manager
Got rich, with thugs scandalous, ayy

[Outro: Young Thug]
Fuck it, we ball, yeah
All the soldiers we lost, yeah
Fuck it, we ball-ooh-all
For all the soldiers we lost
Shawty on percocets in the bag
(All the soldiers we lost)
Got a Rollie and a Pateky in my bag
(All the soldiers we lost)
She just got a nose job and it wasn't that bad
(Fuck it, we ball)
I was juggin' round the city, I came back, ayy
Fuck it, we ball
Yeah, fuck it, we ball
Tear down the mall, yeah
Fuck it, we ball
Tear down the mall, ayy

[Intro]
Yeah
Sad to say it but I love you
Don't take no offense but you're my bitch

[Chorus]
Yeah, you gone fall through every time a nigga call you
That's why I ball how I ball when I spoil you
We was in Miami, first time I saw you
I was in a Phantom when I pulled up on you
It was late nights, late nights in the bando
Fucking on you good got you bustin' like you Rambo
And you keep it hood so you really understand though
You was there through my ups and downs like a camel

[Verse 1]
Ass all fat say she get it from her mama
She just want the money, she ain't fuckin' with no bloggers
Fuck you on a PJ the whole way to the Bahamas
Gucci, Valentino, baby, I can be your stylist
Fuck me with your friend, yeah yeah, you was wildin'
1942 shots turn you to a monster
Thuggin' like you 2Pac, you know that I got you
Love the way you ride it, move them hips like you Rihanna
I was supposed to hit, I was never s'pose to cuff you
Put you on my homie 'cause he say he wanna fuck you
When he asked me 'bout you, I just told him that I want you
But now its quiet for you, 'cause I told him that I loved you

[Chorus]
You gone fall through every time a nigga call you
That's why I ball how I ball when I spoil you
We was in Miami, first time I saw you
I was in a Phantom when I pulled up on you
It was late nights, late nights in the bando
Fucking on you good got you bustin' like you Rambo
And you keep it hood so you really understand though
You was there through my ups and downs like a camel

[Verse 2]
I was locked up, I remember when I hit you
Used to write me back every letter that I sent you
You wasn't my girl but you used to pretend to
When I came home, let me beat it instrumental
Lame left you scarred so I had to reinvent you
If you was car, shit, you ride it like a Benz do
Wraith it with the stars, every time I come and get you
We be goin' hard every time you on that Hen' too
I was in the mix, actin' like a savage
Got another bitch and you told me I could have it
I know you was sick so I doubled back to grab you
So anything you wish, yeah yeah, you can have it

[Chorus]
You gone fall through every time a nigga call you
That's why I ball how I ball when I spoil you
We was in Miami, first time I saw you
I was in a Phantom when I pulled up on you
It was late nights, late nights in the bando
Fucking on you good got you bustin' like you Rambo
And you keep it hood so you really understand though
You was there through my ups and downs like a camel

[Bridge]
Whoa, she just want a ride with a shotta, though
I'm an original don dada, though
Knock them all down like dominoes
Make me tell them other bitches, vamonos
Whoa, good gal, bad gal, small city, mad world
She just wanna shine, whoa
And last night was mad real, sunshades, advils, fuck you all the time

[Chorus]
You gone fall through every time a nigga call you
That's why I ball how I ball when I spoil you
We was in Miami, first time I saw you
I was in a Phantom when I pulled up on you
It was late nights, late nights in the bando
Fucking on you good got you bustin' like you Rambo
And you keep it hood so you really understand though
You was there through my ups and downs like a camel

[Verse 1]
Yah
Big bag, got 'em big mad
A nigga gettin' to some money and his bitch bad
Jumpin' out the Rolls truck with the temp tag
I'm gettin' money, I don't get mad, ugh
Ask a nigga in my hood, he gon' say that I'm stamped
And when them situations came, I came out like a champ
When it was pourin' down rain and I came out of it damp
But now it's champagne showers when we poppin' the champ', ugh
We dodged all the Feds and they traps
Niggas can't be us 'cause they rats
Stand tall, point a finger, never that
I knew a nigga had it all, went to the bing, ain't get it back
That's why I'm humble as ever, and I rumble whatever
Don't chase hoes 'cause they come with this cheddar
I seen my man girl start actin' bougie when he fuck up his cheddar
Before you knew it, niggas was fuckin' her better
I knew about it and I-
Wanted to tell him, I felt funny as ever
But when I told him, he went runnin' to tell her, damn
Remember I was down bad, I'm talkin' under the cellar
Now the Rolls Royces come with umbrellas
For the rain and all the pain that we been through
If you don't feed your wolves they gon' put you on the menu
That's why I be with family and some buls that I been knew
If money determined loyalty, we'd cut you with a Ginsu
Now I go against you, facts

[Chorus]
Rule number one, never count your homie pockets thinkin' you deserve it
Rule number two, never trust a bitch that'll fuck you for some purses
Rule number three, save you some of that money, shit you better stop splurgin'
'Cause when it's all said and done and you back at the bottom, they gon' treat you like you worthless
Respect the game

[Verse 2]
Fuck the fame
We millionaires fuck your watch and lil' chain
Niggas disappear as quick as Lil Zane
You feelin' yourself, I know you got a lil' lane
Just hold your composure, I seen this shit happen over and over
That couple hundred thousand holdin' you over
That ain't real money
That's bill money, buy a Rollie, get a wheel money
Catch a case, pay a lawyer, take a deal money
Now you tapped out and got no appeal money
Callin' home like niggas done did you wrong
But when you had that money you could've put niggas on
And the moment they put cuffs on you, your bitch was gone
Student of the game, I'm just ahead of my class
I'm that nigga, but I never got my head up my ass
You doin' good, but I'm ready for bad
And you won't never catch me frontin' 'cause I'm used to bein' second to last
Respect the game

[Chorus]
Rule number one, never count your homie pockets thinkin' you deserve it
Rule number two, never trust a bitch that'll fuck you for some purses
Rule number three, save you some of that money, shit you better stop splurgin'
'Cause when it's all said and done and you back at the bottom, they gon' treat you like you worthless
Respect the game

[Verse 1: Meek Mill]
All that ass, Lord have mercy
All that champagne, these bitches thirsty
Verserchy, no hold up, I meant Versace

Puffin' on Cali, prolly out in the valley
Sippin' on something drowsy, bitches twerkin' like Miley
Twerk, twerk for a real nigga sellin' work

Try to school me, I'm getting out here early
Dope dealer, Puma life, back of this soccer jersey
Mink draggin', tell PETA I'm swaggin
All these karats like I'm tryna lure in a rabbit (Dag!)
Just to put it (Put it where?) On my jacket (On my jacket)
(What they askin?) What you doin? (What you doin?) Doin' fashion

[Verse 2: Big Sean]
Okay, I walk with a limp and I talk with a slur
I might wear every single chain and mix it up with my fur
I might get every single drink and mix it up til I blur
I tell the bitch get on my lap, but don't you get on my nerves
I need that bag full of green like a lawnmower
John Doe and all Sean Doe it, and I keep it G
Yeah, I ground floor it, and I'm pound blowin'
If her pussy good then I might one, two, three, round four it
Got her down for it
Yeah, nigga overthink, never under stress
Yeah, I understand, your girl over, I'm so unimpressed
Yeah, and she tryna fuck me raw, unprotect
But if I don't have that rubber on it I feel under dressed
Yeah, and I got money bags under my eyes, ho, cause I ain't sleep
They all Goyard too cause I ain't cheap
Finally Famous Aura Gold is my I-N-C
And I put everything in motion like I-N-G
And when we flyin' private you could bring the gun on with us
I got this freak to 3rd base, she tryna run home with us
And I got comma on comma on comma on comma... on comma
And I ain't talking about no run on sentence
Yeah, nigga hot headed so I need that Chings Chili
Put my P up on her head like that bitch is reppin' Philly
And I wheelie in that pussy like my nigga Meek Milly
On my way to meet millis
Lawyer drafting up the deep deep dealies
I got rich decided that ain't rich enough
When I did it big, bitch, I decided that ain't big enough
Dead Pres, who you diggin up?
Who that nigga that you hating on, but just  can't get enough?
Fuck, the jig is up, little bitch

[Verse 3: A$AP Ferg]
I'm like Madoff but I made off, scheming on niggas' payoff
I never take a day off, your stash is short like Adolf, Hitler
You should lay off on the gangsta talk cause you're fake, dog
You never pushed no yay, dawg, ain't see no keys like Ray Charles
Me and Meek in the Maybach, we get Wale and take off
We got your bitch in a big house, she walk in hype like "Hey, Ross, how you doing?"
Get with a dreamchaser, we ballin' hard like the Lakers
You ballin' out, you a faker, you prolly catchin' the vapors
I'm at your house on the hill, I fucked your girl and your neighbor
You thinkin' Khloe don't know me, I'm in the car dashin' haters
I'm in the Kardashian, get it? I'm lyin', can't I pretend?
They say fake it 'til you make it, well, let the fakin' begin
I got a bitch with fake titties, fake ass, she all in the Benz
Them titties'll prolly fall like a ball when she bend
My niggas from Harlem and Philly all get it in
Your bitch come around then we fuckin' her and her friends
Come get with a dreamchaser, we ballin' hard like the Lakers
You ballin' out, you a faker, you prolly catchin' the vapors
Come get with a dreamchaser, we ballin' hard like the Lakers
You ballin' out, you a faker, you prolly catchin' the vapors

I'm at your house on the hill, I fucked your girl and your neighbor, damn!

[Outro: Meek Mill]
What she do?
She, just, put, heart eyes under my pic nigga
That's my bitch nigga
Bought her a first class ticket to put the dick in her

[Intro: Meek Mill & DJ Drama]
See, I'm an A1 type of guy (Uh-oh!)
I crush A1 hoes (true)
Rock A1 clothes (true)
Drive A1 whips (true)
And still pour A1 sauce on my shit
I come from the bottom (Poppin the bottles!)

[Verse 1: Meek Mill]
Crushing all these hoes, rocking all this ice
Selling all these O's, nigga, I done did that twice
So I'm just riding round in my Rolls, about to get on my bike
Just to touchdown in my hood and I put that on my life
I'm like yeah nigga, I'm there nigga, I ball hard all year, nigga
My diamonds all clear nigga, smack my chain you dead nigga
I don't know what you heard, and I don't know what you thought
But all my dogs they murk, and all my dogs go hard, fuck that
My new young chick look exactly like Rihanna
Ass like Nicki, but she yellow like Madonna
I take her to the mall, buy her all types of designers
YSL, fly Chanel, all that Dolce & Gabbana
I jump right back like 36, lean hard when I turn the whip
If I ain't have my rap deal, then I still be serving bricks
So I kill a pussy, I murder shit, homicide on shorty
My gold Role cost 60 racks, my rose gold cost 40

[Hook: Meek Mill]
I get A1 money, I'm an A1 nigga
Got a A1 swagger, I'm getting A1 bitches
I just bought me a Rollie, you can skate on nigga
If they don't love it, they hate it, well get your hate on nigga
'Cause I got A1 everything, A1 everything
A1 everything, I get A1 everything
I got A1 credit, A1 hoes
I drive A1 whips, and I rock A1 clothes

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
Pray to God, I wash my hand but I be damned
2012, 100 racks to Uncle Sam
A 24 year old millionaire
Don't read the contract 'less a mill in there
A1 credit, park my car bowlegged
I got a bus full of bitches, I call it Jay-rome Bettis
I grab my dick in the picture, your ho be cropping the image
I let you scrape off the dishes, we eating nigga, I'll finish
Then come right back, hope you insomniac
Sleep on me if you wanna take a dirt nap
Bitch I'm talking ca-ca-ca-ca then more ca-ca-ca-ca
Hit your roof until I pop your top up
Then more ca-ca-ca-ca, til I know I gotcha
Ballin like I'm baldin', then I see Jordan in the mirror
Nigga, that's flawless VVS, and CC text me, "What you wearing?"
Puttin my all inside your bitch, I grip her hips, that's power steering
About to hydroplane when I board that plane
And land inside the building

[Hook: Meek Mill]
I get A1 money, I'm an A1 nigga
Got a A1 swagger, I'm getting A1 bitches
I just bought me a Rollie, you can skate on nigga
If they don't love it, they hate it, well get your hate on nigga
Cuz I got A1 everything, A1 everything
A1 everything, I get A1 everything
I got A1 credit (Credit), A1 hoes (Hoes)
I drive A1 whips, and I rock A1 clothes, I'm gone!

[Intro: DJ Drama & Meek Mill]
Maybach Music!
They say your brain's most creative in your sleep
See, they say, in the sleep state
The brain thinks much more visually and intuitively
Ha, what is this? (Maybach Music)
I like this Maybach Music! Swate!
As dreamchasers, we accomplish that wide awake
Turn everything up a lil bit in the headphones!
You ready? (All-Star!)

[Verse 1: Meek Mill]
Ready or not, here I come
You can't hide, nigga I'm too damn fly
Sippin' all of this purple, it got me too damn high
They say they're down for the team but playin' two damn sides
I'm like niggas ain't loyal (no!), niggas ain't loyal (no!)
And these voices in my head saying niggas ain't for you (nah!)
And when you gettin money these niggas will aim for you (fire!)
And when its looking sunny these niggas will rain on you
It's a dark cloud over me, money took control of me
I'm barely getting time to see my son and that shit hurting me
Baby momma trippin out, I tell her to work with me
I'm on probation still strapped, 'cause niggas want to murder me
And lately I've been getting faded (faded)
Cut a couple homies off cause them niggas hating (they hating)
And all these bitches wanna fuck me
'Cause a nigga made it (I made it!)
I'm getting paper heart cold as the refrigerator

[Chorus: Meek Mill]
Young nigga getting money
Young nigga getting money
Young nigga go and get it yeah
And ain't a damn thing change but the bezel on my Rollie
And the diamonds in my chain, yeah

[Interlude: DJ Drama]
As dreamchasers, we consider ourselves a creative upper class
When it comes to ideas, we're just in a different tax bracket
Gangsta Grillz, you bastards! (Gangsta!)

[Verse 2: Meek Mill]
Young rich nigga quarter millie worth of jewels (jewels)
Bad bitch with me trying blow me like a fuse (fuse)
Just to get a bag or maybe a pair of shoes (shoes)
Ain't it crazy what your lady would do for a pair of Loubs, huh?
Big dreams turn to big things (things)
I've been waiting on this day since I was 16 (16)
Big chains, Aston Martin as I switch lanes (skrrt!)
Before I ever made a hit, I had a wrist game
In the kitchen with them thangs, trying make a killing (killing)
We in the building, every other month I make a million (yeah!)
Any nigga talking reckless cause they think I'm chilling
'Til I put some money on their head, yeah, make 'em feel it
Have they own homies do him like they never knew him (fire!)
I'll have Omelly walk up on him when we run into him (fire!)
Close range shorty have him put something through him
So I hope you're ready cause we heavy and we're coming for you

[Chorus: Meek Mill]
Young nigga getting money
Young nigga getting money
Young nigga go and get it yeah
And ain't a damn thing change but the bezel on my Rollie
And the diamonds in my chain, yeah

[Interlude: DJ Drama]
Dreamchasers 2
We decided to share the wealth again
Care to join us?

[Verse 3: Meek Mill]
The meek shall inherit the earth
So I'ma own this bitch until I'm buried in dirt
I only roll with niggas that'll carry me to my hearse
Blesses for my grandma, she carried me to that church
And I don't know why, I just feel like I'm the one (one)
They label me a victim but now look what I become ('come)
Or should I say became, I don't do it for the fame
I'm from where they never make it but I went against the grain
Charges riding against my name, assasination to my character
Life's a bitch, she cheated on me but I married her
Niggas getting murdered, this shit is getting scarier
Dodging all the potholes, jumping all the barriers
And if she a bitch, I feel like I just got in that pussy (yeah)
Shorty wanna be a star, that's why she popping that pussy
She trying to win, so she hang amongst winners
That's why I take the time just to pray at mom's dinner (I pray)
Cause I remember, cold nights not the winter (not the winter)
Not the weather, I'm talk about within us (within us)
Cause for that money, sins they get committed
And friends, they get to splittin', divided just like division
So every day that I wake up, my undivided attention
It goes to getting my cake up and staying out of them prisons
Yeah! The system made me stronger
And being broke just gave me my hunger, I'm gone!

[Outro: Meek Mill]
Nigga like me?
I walk around, fear no man (no man!)
I don't owe you niggas shit! (shit!)
E'ry nigga you see around me
That's the niggas that's with me (my niggas)
Unless they in jail or dead or something
Nigga livin' life like, "Fuck all you niggas"
You feel me?

[Verse 1]
Lord, forgive me for my sins, used to pray to get a brick
Nigga icy like it's hockey, and I'm playin' with them sticks
He don't like me, but he gotta respect the fact we gettin' rich
Nigga threw a shot and missed me, threw 'em back and he got hit
Brrrt, brrrt
Went from public housing to a glass house (Glass house)
Fuckin' famous bitches in my trap house
My main bitch fight my side bitch, Kash Doll
The only way to keep them quiet when I cash out (Woo!)
What you doin'? Gettin' paid, young nigga
How you in the mob? 'Cause I'm made, young nigga
Say you need a job, come my way, young nigga
And if I point 'em out, better spray them niggas, bop!
I'm a bad influence (Bad influence, ho)
Talkin' money and I speak it fluent (Speak it fluent, ho)
Paid a couple mill' to wear Puma (Wearing Puma)
I thank God for all this sauce, hallelujah, woo (Amen, amen, amen)
Yeah I knew it, hatin' on me, yeah, I knew it (Yeah, I knew it)
Come down to that check, I'm like Nike, I just do it (I just do it)
Boy I must be poppin', they keep poppin' up with rumors (Poppin')
Where and who I'm poppin', what I'm coppin'

She said, "Meek, you know my boyfriend
And what's his name" (What's his name)
Yeah I know him, mhmm, he a lame (He a lame)
Don't you ever bring that fuckboy up again

[Chorus]
Poppin' all this shit, need some tissue
I can't trust a bitch 'cause I got issues
Young rich nigga so official
Neck so disrespectful, might offend you (Woah)
Bunch of bad broads on the menu
Bunch of foreign cars when we been through
Neck so disrespectful, might offend you
When it's time for war we send the missiles (Woah)

[Verse 2]
Hangin' by the rope buy some dope (Buy some dope)
Pretty hoe, deep throat 'til she choke (Ooh)
Pussy good, super wet, need a boat (Need a boat)
Niggas tryna ride my wave, let 'em float (Let 'em die)
Put my young bull on the chain 'cause I miss Snupe (Miss Snupe)
Fuck a bad broad, make her kiss Snupe (Kiss Snupe)
I can't ever tell a bitch, "I miss you" (Miss you)
Better not tell nobody if I kiss you (Bitch, you)
Kiss and tell, fuck you good, hit you well (Hit you well)
I just made like 20 M's, they say it's an L (What?)
Niggas prayin' that I fall and I wish 'em well
Bitch you crazy, I'm too wavy, I'm like Biggavel'

[Chorus]
Poppin' all this shit, need some tissue
I can't trust a bitch 'cause I got issues
Young rich nigga so official
Neck so disrespectful, might offend you (Woah)
Bunch of bad broads on the menu
Bunch of foreign cars when we bend through
Neck so disrespectful, might offend you
When it's time for war we send the missiles (Woah)

[Bridge]
Hit 'em with finesse, kill 'em with success
Nigga lookin' broke, give them niggas stress (Broke)
Don't do some shit you know that you gon' regret
Reachin' for my neck, that'll get you stretched (Brrrt, brrrt)

[Chorus]
Poppin' all this shit, need some tissue
I can't trust a bitch 'cause I got issues
Young rich nigga so official
Neck so disrespectful, might offend you (Woah)
Bunch of bad broads on the menu
Bunch of foreign cars when we bend through
Neck so disrespectful, might offend you
When it's time for war we send the missiles (Brrrt, brrrt)

[Intro: Meek Mill]
Yeah, la-da-da, la-da-da-da, yeah

[Verse 1: Meek Mill]
I never had a role model
I was loading gold hollows in my little Glock-40
A little shorty, heart colder than December in the morning
And I think it was December when they swarmed me
Niggas is jealous, fuck can they tell us
With them dreams they try to sell us? Probably why I'm rebellious
To a fraud nigga, I lost niggas when I got paper
It's like more money I made, they got faker
And it's crazy when your best friend turn into your top hater
Wanna roll out on you and smoke you like top paper
Damn, what a feeling when you and your homie chilling
And you know he got thoughts of probably robbing and killing you
Momma said don't ever, ever let them belittle you
And stay away from them haters cause they'll riddle you
Last year was like a bad year
Even though I touched more paper than a cashier
Small circle, I ain't never really 'round squares
They say there's levels to this shit, you niggas downstairs
Different floors for different bulls
Different tours on different jets, my niggas saw
Different city with different bitches and different whores
Sometimes I look in the mirror, Meek Milly, this your car?
Look at your arm, check out your neck, look at your charm
And to think my niggas started off with cooking raw
When it was hard the coach told me to get the ball
I step back for the three, watch it go swish and fall
And that was and-one, they thinking how we get this far?
We was just down by three and they thought we took a loss
They couldn't D me like Earl Boykins, I'm sticking soft
Tried to pick me off like Champ Bailey but I'm Randy Moss
And I ran it all for the touchdown, what now?
Gold AP all bust down, fuck clowns

[Chorus: Meek Mill]
My heart getting cold, and the streets getting colder
They said I wouldn't make it no way
I think my heart getting colder, my heart getting cold
Told them I would make it one day, only Lord knows

[Verse 2: Meek Mill]
Dedicated, determinated and disciplined
When Diddy, Hova, and Baby talking, I'm listening
When I be in the jungle, the Devil be whispering
Slugs flying by me I hear them, they whistling
That was a close call
Stand up nigga so I won't fall
My teacher told me I would never go far
Seen him last week, he was my chauffeur, I was like "told y'all"
Mommy was a booster, daddy was a shooter
So they couldn't blame me when I went and copped a Ruger
Looking at my homies, see the ghost of Freddy Krueger
Cause if he catch you sleeping he's gon' knock out your medulla
Oblongata, I'm a father and my son don't see a lot of
If I don't get he gon' probably end up with a chopper
In a field out in Philly do you feel me?
Told my momma I won't let these haters kill me
Getting high even though it might derail me
And I won't ever let these bitches see the real me, do you feel me?
Times change like the Rollie did
Now I'm killing these niggas the way that Kobe did

[Interlude: Diddy]
Ayo, it gets fucked up when your own family start calling you up
Shit, money's the root of all evil
Family start telling you "you acting different nigga"
You're goddamn right I'm acting different
With all this motherfucking money
But then when it comes from your brother, your sister
Your mother, your father, that shit hurts you to the core man
When they start acting like something that you ain't never motherfucking seen
You done grew up motherfucker
They gave birth to you, know what I'm saying?
You got raised, you done played in the park with them
This money thing, this shit will fuck you up man
You got to watch what you ask for
You sure you want this son? You sure you want this money?
You sure you want this fame? You sure you want this power?
Shit have your own mama talking to you like you ain't shit
Yeah everybody want it, everybody need it, money motherfuckers
Get money don't stop but I ain't mad at them
Shit, but shit even bosses got feelings you know?
Dear mama, dear papa, family, we're all we got
Don't let this money bring us down
Shit, everybody eats B, everybody eats, everybody eats
Let's go, hahahah

[Verse 3: Meek Mill]
Uh, yeah
And we started off as kids, stomach's touching our ribs
And them streets all night like we ain't have nowhere to live
I remember Sundays we ain't have nothing but Liv
Thirty thousand was the tab and you ain't have nothing to give
I ain't trip, I ain't trip, I pour bottles, I ain't sip
I let niggas shine bright, you still act like I ain't shit?
Let you have them little hoes, they was all on my dick
And your main wanted to fuck me nigga, I ain't hit
Twenty chains, eight watches, can't fit on my wrist
When I speak about them things I never said it's my shit
I said it's ours nigga and when you're ready we're gonna ball nigga
Like Kobe Bryant, Metta Peace and Gasol, nigga
But I know just what I saw nigga
It was envious, you looked sideways and I remembered it
The reason that my heart's cold now on some December shit
You used to give thanks for giving on some November shit
Talking about the twenty-fifth, matter of fact the twenty-sixth
Maybe it's the twenty-eighth, fuck it though my money's straight
As long as Papi smiling
I'mma be on airplane mode flier than a pilot
I've seen it, I've seen it
Jealousy in your eyes, I swear that look was deceiving
And I was surprised man I ain't want to believe it
You said you would ride but shit, I know you ain't mean it
But yeah nigga I've seen it

[Chorus: Meek Mill]
My heart getting cold, and the streets getting colder
They said I would't make it no way
I think my heart getting colder, my heart getting cold
Told them I would make it one day, only Lord knows

[Intro: Eric Thomas & Meek Mill]
You have to eat the dream
You have to sleep the dream
You have to dream the dream
You gotta touch
You have to see it when nobody else sees it
You have to feel it when it's not tangible
You have to believe it when you cannot see it
You gotta be possessed with the dream
Yeah, any weapon formed against us shall not prosper
Young nigga started with Oodles of noodles, now we eating lobster

[Verse: Meek Mill]
As I walk through the valley with my ladder in flex
I'm the realest nigga in it, I just happen to rap
When they all thought we was finished, they was laughing at that
So I went and bought me a Dawn and flipped that hat to the back
Fuck 'em
New jewelry, new whips on the way now
Brr, brr, that's yo bitch on the way now
Mama told me if you fall, never stay down
Stand up nigga, I can never lay down
Wins and the losses, it come with being bosses
Shoot a pussy nigga in his head if he cross us
Take that shit to trial if the feds making offers
Five hundred thou', lawyer said we lookin' awesome
Swap that Patek for them cuffs, take them off us
Lil' bitch, call me Lil' Fish
Niggas tryna turn my lights out, it's still lit
Streets calling and they said they want some real shit
Young bull looking like he hit a real lick
I got too many foreigns, man this shit getting borin'
Half a milli' last week, you would've thought I was touring
Niggas tried to count me out, I guess they thought I was normal
They ain't know I was different, I'm like "Lord be my witness"
'Cause we was fucking up them dishes in my grandmama kitchen
Get a pigeon, do division, break it down on my niggas
Fuck they opinions why would I listen, they ain't see the vision
When I had a foreign I ain't see them bitches
So I'ma ball on 'em
Magic City, let it fall on 'em
And all my niggas stayed down with me
Know I be there if they call on me
Yeah!
My nigga bail half a milli, he made it home in a week
Even my momma know how I'm rocking, I go on them streets
Glock .40, keep it on me, we rolling 32 deep
Bulletproof everything, just let me know if it's beef
We bring the war, I just wanna shine like my Rollie
Put in all this time that they owe me
Made it to a nine and we litty
Dropping 60s too like we Kobe, oh
Pushing the foreigns, drive through the trenches (Trenches)
Top of the food chain, head of commission ('Mission)
We wackin' niggas without permission ('Mission)
Never was personal, it was business (Brrrrr!)
Brrr, settle down, let it settle down
Couldn't tell me shit when I was broke
Fuck they gon' tell me now?
I'm running round
Glock with a drum that hold a hundred rounds (Brrr!)
If it was "Fuck them niggas" then
It's fuck them niggas now, fuck 'em!
Never change on my roll dawgs
'Bout that Cain bang them thangs like we O-Dog
Walk up in a dealer and I pull that rolls off
These niggas said I wouldn't make it like I told y'all
Ahh!

So just hold up, let me open up with this ganja

[Intro: A Boogie Wit Da Hoodie]
I'm drownin'
I'm drownin'
I'm drownin'
I'm drownin'

[Chorus: A Boogie Wit Da Hoodie]
Wrist so icy, wonder why she like me, bitch I'm drownin'
In water, I just bought a Cuban, dipped it in a fountain
Everywhere that I go it's a light show, I'm surrounded
Bust down, bust down, bust down, bust down, bust down, bitch I'm drownin'
I just bought a Cuban ring and dipped it in a fountain
Chain so heavy I feel like I'm holdin' up a mountain
Everywhere that I go it's a light show, I'm surrounded
Bust down, bust down, bust down, bust down, bust down, bitch I'm drownin'

[Verse 1: A Boogie Wit Da Hoodie]
I'm with all my niggas, I don't go nowhere without 'em
If they don't let us in they might throw shots at the bouncer
Actavis medicine, got it straight from out the doctor's
I'm with RJ but I call him Wayne 'cause he's a shotta
Pick up the ladder, put it in the gun, make the .9 stretch
Niggas with attitude, but we come straight out of Highbridge
I'm gon' make her panties wet when she see the way I flex
I'm gon' win a Grammy, move my family out the projects
We went from chillin' in the projects to makin' projects
We was tryna get to the top, and they tried to stop us
I talk for myself, bitch I don't need no fucking voucher
She looked at my wrist and she looked at a hundred thousand

[Chorus: A Boogie Wit Da Hoodie]
Wrist so icy, wonder why she like me, bitch I'm drownin'
In water, I just bought a Cuban, dipped it in a fountain
Everywhere that I go it's a light show, I'm surrounded
Bust down, bust down, bust down, bust down, bust down, bitch I'm drownin'
I just bought a Cuban ring and dipped it in a fountain
Chain so heavy I feel like I'm holdin' up a mountain
Everywhere that I go it's a light show, I'm surrounded
Bust down, bust down, bust down, bust down, bust down, bitch I'm drownin'

[Verse 2: Kodak Black]
Just bought a brand new chain from Avianne
Nigga with attitude but I ain't from Compton
Lil Kodak, bitch, I'm Polo'd down like Carlton
Sniper Gang, I put a nigga on a carton
I'm the shit I'm fartin', I don't know how to potty
Pull up in a 'Rari, I'm in the Yo like Gotti
A Boogie, I'm goin' Scottie, nigga drop my deposit
I ain't Jamaican, bitch I'm Haitian, but I got them shottas
Harley Davidson every day, I'm ridin' with the chopper
They hatin', I know they don't wanna see a nigga prosper
I ain't doing trims, I'm in the cut like I'm a barber
She call me daddy, but I ain't her motherfucking father

[Chorus: A Boogie Wit Da Hoodie]
Wrist so icy, wonder why she like me, bitch I'm drownin'
In water, I just bought a Cuban, dipped it in a fountain
Everywhere that I go it's a light show, I'm surrounded
Bust down, bust down, bust down, bust down, bust down, bitch I'm drownin'
I just bought a Cuban ring and dipped it in a fountain
Chain so heavy I feel like I'm holdin' up a mountain
Everywhere that I go it's a light show, I'm surrounded
Bust down, bust down, bust down, bust down, bust down, bitch I'm drownin'

[Outro: A Boogie Wit Da Hoodie]
Bitch, I'm drownin'
Bitch, I'm drownin'

Now I'm saying, "What's good with you?"
I remember being in the hood with you
I still think about you

[Verse 1]
Fuck all the phony shit
Fuck it, I'm stuck on some doly shit
Had a knife in my back when I wrote this shit
I look back and I laugh when I noticed it
I shoot up and lean back on some Kobe shit
They don't know how to pass on some Kobe shit
Should've listened, my mom always told me this
I was only 13 when she told me this
Watch who you fuck with
And never ever trust a nigga for nothing
Even if you feel like you really love her
Don't ever tell that bitch that you really love her
'Cause that's when she's gon' make you feel like you nothing
And that's when you gon' start to feel like you buggin'
I wish I would've never told you wassup
And I wish I never even told you pull up

[Chorus]
Got me saying, "What's good with you?"
I remember being in the hood with you
Everything was always understood with you
Girl I even bust a couple juugs with you
I still think about you
Girl I still think about you
Said you always gon' be there for me
Now you gone and you just disappeared on me
Can't believe I really thought you cared for me
You was s'posed to be the one that's here with me
I still think about you
Girl I still think about you

[Verse 2]
I hope that I never see you again
I don't wanna put up with it
I don't wanna fuck with it
I'ma just send you this letter whenever I'm done with it
I know you gon' read it
I called you a bitch at the end, I don't know if I mean it
I ain't wanna believe what my niggas was telling me
My nigga I shoulda cheated
And now I feel stupid
I shoulda knew better than this
Wasn't the right way to do it
I should've been choosing the money instead of a bitch
Fuck it cause I'm gettin' to it
Just watch how I do it
I knew I was ready for this
Bitch I'ma focus on music
You love how I do it
I knew I was ready for this

[Chorus]
Got me saying, "What's good with you?"
I remember being in the hood with you
Everything was always understood with you
Girl I even bust a couple juugs with you
I still think about you
Girl I still think about you
Said you always gon' be there for me
Now you gone and you just disappeared on me
Can't believe I really thought you cared for me
You was s'posed to be the one that's here with me
I still think about you
Girl I still think about you

[Verse 3]
But all I can say is you dumb ho, you got me feeling stupid
You got me singing all these love songs
What the fuck am I doing?
I don't know what I'm doing
But I'm going up though, I just hope I don't lose it
Bitches pickin' and choosin'
But I know what's up tho, I already been through it
We coulda been balling together
Hit up the mall, it's whatever
You know that I started from nothing
Them bitches was fed up
The way you made all of them jealous
You said that you was gon' ride forever and ever
You told me forever and ever
I shoulda known you was lyin'
I shoulda known better
You lied I should've knew better

[Chorus]
But still I'm saying, "What's good with you?"
I remember being in the hood with you
Everything was always understood with you
Girl I even bust a couple juugs with you
I still think about you
Girl I still think about you
Said you always gon' be there for me
Now you gone and you just disappeared on me
Can't believe I really thought you cared for me
You was s'posed to be the one that's here with me
I still think about you
Girl I still think about you

[Outro]
Now I'm saying, "What's good with you?"
I remember being in the hood with you
Everything was always understood with you
Even bust a couple juugs with you
I still think a'
I still think ab'
I still think about you yeah
I still think about you, you, you, you
Had a knife in my back when I wrote this shit
I look back and I dab when I noticed it
I look back and I dab when I noticed it
I look back and I dab when I noticed it
I look back and I laughed when I noticed it
I still think about you, you, you, you
I still think about you, you, you, you
(Now I'm saying, "What's good with you?")
I still think about you
I look back and I dab when I noticed it

[Intro]
Nigga this is what that jungle do
You been plottin' nigga, wasn't you?
I should have never even fucked with you

[Verse 1]
Yeah I started in the back, had to skip the line though
I'ma keep that shit a stack 'til my fucking time go
Niggas throw you in the shade cause they wanna shine though
Nigga throw me in the grave in a Ferragamo
Man I can't believe they killed my fucking bro Quado
Shit was so deep I had to say that with my eyes closed
That shit made me wanna treat a nigga like he John Doe
Nine on me Rondo, now that nigga John Doe

[Bridge 1]
This is all I ever wanted nigga
Why would I let you take it from me nigga?
I ain't stupid, ain't no dummy nigga
A couple fingers on a couple triggers
Fuck with you, why would I fuck with you?
You been plottin', nigga wasn't you?
I should have been watching from the jump with you
Fuck it, this is what that jungle do

[Verse 2]
Started, what I started
Anybody want a problem, this is my shit
Tell 'em if they want a problem I'm from Highbridge
Got a nigga with a shotgun up in my whip
Making bitches go retarded with this hard dick
Why you think my name is Artist? I'm an artist
I woke up to a m'nage, I'm just being honest
I get money, if I want it, I'ma cop it
If a nigga want static let him have it
Have you ever seen a mini semi-automatic?
It go dumb like a drum, hear the beat blastin'
When it come to that fire, I'm a fucking dragon

[Chorus]
Nigga this is what that jungle do
Nigga this is what that jungle do
You been plottin' nigga wasn't you?
I should have never even fuck with you

[Verse 3]
I was walking in the rain with my Timbs on
Stepping over puddles full of pain, it's a big storm
13 on my Balmains, it's a big storm
In the club love to make it rain
Like what nigga, we don't fuck witcha
Know I'm all about my bucks nigga, I don't trust niggas
Ever since I was a young nigga coming up nigga
Ain't nobody show me love nigga, so it's fuck niggas
It's just us nigga

[Bridge 2]
Nigga this is what that jungle do
Nigga this is what that jungle do
That jungle turned me into a monster
That jungle made me go harder
That jungle turned me to a monster
That jungle made me go harder
That jungle turned me to a monster
That jungle made me go harder
That jungle turned me to a monster
That jungle made me go harder

[Chorus]
The jungle turned me to a monster
The jungle made me go harder
Jungle turned me to a monster
Nigga this is what that jungle do

Bitch, I'm really timeless
Let me beat it up like Jaegen

[Verse 1]
I cannot waste no time, bitch, I'm really timeless
I cannot leave my houses without diamonds
All the faces on my watches, jump out it
Change faces on the watches, now they frownin'
I probably spent the 100 thousand on fly shit
QP spent the 100 thousand on mileage
Bruce Lee kick it with me, I be stylin'
2 seater Bentley and it's topless
And she's topless, naked bitch driver
Papers and fronto wrapped around Sour
I cannot waste no time, bitch, I'm really timeless
I cannot waste no time, bitch, I'm really...

[Refrain]
I cannot waste no time, bitch, I'm really grindin'
If I ever said, "I love you", I was lyin'
I fuck with you but you was always like a side bitch
Cause I can never put nothin' over grindin'

[Verse 2]
I just left my baby girl a message
I said, I won't be comin' home
Hah, that's a dub, bitch, I'm on the road
Hah, and I need 20 thousand for a show
Hah, I ain't walkin' through your club no more
Hah, But if Lust hit me up I'll go

Got zippers on my jeans like I'm Billy on this
I ain't sippin' no more lean I've been trippin' off it
I've been pissin' codeine and I ain't wit the shits, woah
Rockstar lifestyle, might not make it
Wake up faded still end up drinking
Make-up on my t-shirt, I hate it
R.I.P. t-shirts, I hate it
Fall asleep, wake up still I'm faded
Bubba prolly lost 50 K in vegas
Pour up purple and then make it turn pinkish
Said that I was done with it but I'm still drinkin'
I can't waste no time, I can't waste no time with it
I can't waste no time, bitch, I'm really timeless
I can't waste no time, bitch, I'm really timeless

Bought my bitch a Birkin bag now, she a brat now

When I pull up it go skrrt skrrt, that's a foreign
When I pull up on a red light, they don't want it
Yeah I came up from the mud and my baby know that
Introduced her to my plug, now she think she all that
When I first hit her up, no she never wrote back
Then I saw her at the club so I got up on that

[Chorus]
Now every time they play this song she say "This is my shit" (This is my shit)
See the flick of my wrist (Flick of my wrist)
And I know she know wassup, baby this is my shit (This is my shit)
See the flick of my wrist (Flick of my wrist)

[Verse 2]
They know that's my bitch, that's a fact and she stuck with me

All about my F, can't put water over blood nigga

What the fuck, I'm 'posed to fall in love with you?
Bitch, I should've never even...

[Verse 1]
What the fuck, I'm 'posed to fall in love with you?
Bitch, I should've never even fucked with you
Trust issues, that shit made me feel uncomfortable
I should've never made you feel like I was stuck with you
You ever had somebody say that they was down for you?
They made it feel so real like they really down for you
They clown on you every time they turn around on you
They not loyal, they happy, they lookin' down on you
You really jacking, you don't fuck with me
Now I feel like you never kept it a buck with me
You saying I ain't the daddy, that would be luckily
I'm hoping that ain't my baby, that shit gon' fuck with me
You had me looking like a clown, bitch
That other nigga gon' fuck up running his mouth, bitch
How I fuck him up and drown him in a fountain
Leave that little nigga somewhere in the mountains

[Chorus]
But now I'm like, "What the fuck, nigga?"
I love money, I don't love bitches
Fuck bitches, D.T.B., no, I don't trust bitches
Fuck bitches, D.T.B., no, I don't trust bitches
No kissing and even hugging
'Cause I don't wanna fall in love with it
Fuck bitches, D.T.B., no, I don't trust bitches
Fuck bitches, D.T.B., no, I don't trust bitches

[Verse 2]
What the fuck, I'm 'posed to fall in love with you?
Bitch, I just wanted to fuck with you
Thought you was cool to kick it, probably get lunch with you
I never meant for shit to get so fucking comfortable
Your niggas told you they was down for you
But when you fucked up, nigga, they not around for you
They say they with it to ride a hundred thou' for you
They clown on you as soon as they turn around on you
I salute ya, you took my bitch and you scooped her
I'm a loser, I feel like a fucking loser
Fuck the rumors 'cause I passed her back to ya
Ran through her, then I passed her back to ya
Hah!
But now I'm feeling like I'm, ahh!
Fuck bitches, D.T.B., no, I don't trust bitches
Fuck bitches, D.T.B., no, I don't trust bitches
Love bitches, nah
Now I'm like, "What the fuck, nigga?"
I don't wanna fall in love with it
I love money, I don't love bitches
Fuck bitches, fuck bitches, fuck bitches
Fuck bitches, fuck bitches, fuck bitches
Fuck bitches, my nigga, we don't fuck with ya
My nigga, we don't fuck with ya
Fuck bitches, fuck bitches, fuck bitches
Fuck bitches, fuck bitches, fuck bitches
My nigga, we don't fuck with ya
My nigga, we don't fuck with ya' why you fuck?
Fuck bitches, D.T.B., no, I don't trust bitches
Fuck bitches, D.T.B., no, I don't trust bitches

[Part II]

[Verse]
I love money, I don't love bitches
Fuck bitches, fuck bitches, fuck bitches, fuck bitches
My nigga, we don't fuck' wit' ya
So why you fuck wit' us?
I believed in you, should've told me you had a seed in you
This whole time you was frontin' and I ain't see it in you
Now I'm thinkin' what was you doin' when I ain't sleep with you
Now your toothbrush is my new Jordan cleaner
I know what a ten is, you not Serena
You was supposed to be my dream girl
Two-seater, for me and you in a Bimmer
But now you showed me not to love bitches
Now you showed me not to trust bitches
Fuck bitches, just hit it, never run wit' it
Hit the blunt
Forget about her when the blunt hit ya
Who did it? Bitch, you did it
Really thought that I was losin' it, now I'm losin'
Ever since I been in school, they been pick and choosin'
I don't know how I go through wit' it, I go through wit' it
This is stupid
But who the fuck am I to judge bitches?
I guess I never knew how to love bitches
Fuck bitches, fuck bitches, fuck bitches
My nigga we don't fuck' wit' ya
So why you fuck wit' us?
Fuck bitches, fuck bitches

[Intro]
Wasn't I good to you?
Cardo got wings

[Chorus]
Yeah, at least I was good to you
At least I was good to you
At least I was good to you
At least I was good to you

[Verse]
I can't make no fucking promises
Lifestyle getting out of control, lifestyle getting ludicrous
I made a milli' in less than a year and I blew that on stupid shit
Typed it in like, "How to make a milli'" I used to google it
Savannah just wanted to see me perform
And got hit over stupid shit
I woke up and saw the shit right on my phone
They don't know who the shooter is
You never know, never feel untouchable
I touched your soul, made you feel so comfortable
If I let you go, I would feel so skeptical
Unacceptable but I still gotta let you know
Yeah, that I can't make no fucking promises
I can't make no fucking promises, I can't make no fucking promises
Yeah, lifestyle on the road, sheesh
Used to always want a Rollie, now I want a new two-tone gold Patek
Yeah, we couldn't go to Phillipe's
I had to be on that corner until it was morning
So me and my niggas could eat
I be the one with the sauce, I never thought it was sweet
I got my foot in the door
They never gave me the key, I had to turn to a ki
Even when I was a boy
I was the man in the streets, I was the man with the heat
I was a beast, sheesh
He had her heart, but she tried to give it to me
Damn, but she can't keep no fucking promises
Shit, I'm coming with a lotta money, money comes with a lotta shit
Told Mo, "Bring the studio to everywhere we go" and that's a lotta hits
Slo-mo in my videos, when the lights out, all my diamonds hit
Something 'bout blue faces, I like money conversations
Whole lotta 20's that's basic, nigga, fuck it, I'm shameless
Can't fuck with a snitch nigga, if you get caught, don't say shit
Have you ever met another nigga like me? I bet you won't say shit
I went from rags to riches
I bagged the bitches that gave me the straight face
I hit the baddest bitches
It's sad but I had to curve 'em the same day
I treated them bad
I wouldn't be mad if I was to get treated the same way
So treat me the same way, same way, same way
I was a savage to you
I had to give up and put all my hoes to the side
I swear if I ever left you in the cold
It's 'cause it was colder inside
Look here, I swear if you ever try to leave me alone
I hope you don't turn to a thot
Most of the niggas that call me only hit my phone
Because I get money a lot
I be the one with the throne
You say you gon' take it but nigga we know that's a lie
Even before we was on
The money was long and we used to fuck up the spot
Bitches was singing my song
I knew I was on, right when I bust down a watch
Niggas was hating before and they hate on me now
But don't know what to say to me now
I was gonna do it to her, but I don't really wanna use her
Keep giving excuses, when we really gonna link up?
Even if I sound stupid, I'ma say what's real to her
Even if she not truthful, fuck it I'ma still be good to you

[Chorus]
Yeah, at least I was good to you
At least I was good to you
Yeah, at least I was good to you
At least I was good to you

If the opps try to turn my song off, run it back
Used to have the pack in my long johns, now I rap

[Verse 4: 6ix9ine]
If a nigga wanna act out, got the MAC out
I ain't got no fuckin' back-up, that's a man down
I ain't got the fuckin' forty, knock his teeth out
Spin back with the Ruger, air the block out

[Chorus: A Boogie wit da Hoodie]
Swervin' (Swervin')

We got London On Da Track

[Intro]
Ness on the beat
I'm not a regular person

[Verse 1]
Done with the perkys
I don't even feel like it's working
I was playing the bench, I was lurking
On the block where they plotting on murking
You don't even know I was hurting
I was fucked up, a bitch had me hurting
And I think she did it on purpose
I can't fuck with the hate, I'm allergic
I feel like they had me on standby
See the pain in my damn eyes
I got out of jail and my mans died
I never sleep, I'm a vampire
I'm not a regular person
I can't be giving out verses
I'm making the industry nervous
I'm still working through all the disturbance
I'm done with these Balenciagas
They keep on fucking my socks up
Nothing but foreigns behind us
We used to pull up in the Honda
Now every time that we pop up
We got to pull up in designer
We doing it just to remind us
To never go back to the bottom
They started off hating on me
Everybody debating on me
A nigga wrote a statement on me
My life, they want to take it from me
So I got a .380 on me
It ain't never on safety, I be
Having all of this paper on me
I just hope you praying for me
I can tell you what happened
The streets turned me into a savage
I started off juggin' and trapping
Watch a couple a niggas get blasted
Way too much blood for a napkin
Won't nobody tell you what happened
I'm good when you see me in traffic
Automatic in the Benz 4matic
In the S550 I'm speeding
Nigga you wouldn't believe it
I came up from nothing I mean it
Now I'm living everything I was dreaming
I'm killing, I feel like I'm cheating
They kept on giving me reasons
Can't nobody get in between us
Only us, I put that on everything

[Chorus]
Fuck it up, fuck it up now
My nigga, it's just us now
Every Rollie getting bust down
Young niggas repping uptown
I was down but I'm up now
Fuck around with them fuck 'rounds
Ain't no pounds or "what's ups" now
Pretty bitches hit me up now

[Verse 2]
I got on Saint Laurent, come here baby
I just wanted some company baby
I don't want you to feel like I'm playing
Can I fuck you without you complaining?
Got no time for a lunch with you baby
I get bread, what the fuck is you saying?
I get fly on any different occasion
I be in and out of different locations
I can't stop, I put on for this
Swear to god I put on for this
Had to move out my mama's crib
Had to put in overtime for this
I can brag cause I'm confident
I'm the man, ain't no stopping it
I don't got to wait for a shopping list
I want to body a fit then I'm copping it

[Chorus]
I fuck it up, fuck it up now
Every Rollie getting bust down
Young niggas repping uptown
I was down but I'm up now
Ain't no pounds or "what's ups" now
My nigga it's just us now
I'm not a regular person, I'm not a regular person
I'm not a regular person, I'm not a regular person

And every single chain, and my diamond rings
The way you walkin', the way you talkin', it's all because of me
And the way I'm all on you, girl, you know it's true
The way I speak, it's my melody
Don't you ever think it's another me

[Intro]
Another one, it's another one
And another one
Huh?

[Chorus]
Every time I make another one, it's another one
Don't be all up on my french toast when that butter come
She tried to put me in the friend zone, but she wanted some
Fuck it, I'll be in that friend zone cause I fuck with her
After fuckin' her
She tried to put me in the friend zone
Fuck it, I'll be in that friend zone
Scorin' like the end zone

[Verse 1]
Two doors, black on black whip
Told that bitch that I'm from New York, she like my accent
Every time I get a new jawn, she the baddest
All these zippers on my Balmain, I feel like Jackson
Every time she give me good head, I give her backshots
Man that pussy so good, I don't wanna back out
So I gotta strap up, just to blow her back out
When she know I'm 'bout to nut, she don't tell me back out
She put her ass out
That's what happened before I passed out
She really got me in my bag now
She got me in my bag now
Huh?

[Chorus]
Every time I make another one, it's another one
Don't be all up on my french toast when that butter come
She tried to put me in the friend zone, but she wanted some
Fuck it, I'll be in that friend zone cause I fuck with her
After fuckin' her
She tried to put me in the friend zone
Fuck it, I'll be in that friend zone
Scorin' like the end zone
Huh?

[Verse 2]
I laughed with her, smoked gas with her
When I showed her I can rap, she said, "You a bad nigga"
I said, "What about your man?" She said, "Fuck that nigga"
You must have been doin' bad with her
She said she only let me hit to get you mad
Oh, it's so sad, nigga
Takin' niggas bitches back to back, yeah I'm that nigga
A-Boogie on her titty, took my autograph with her
Whoever she goin' home to, I feel bad for that nigga
He gon' be a mad nigga
He won't even wanna talk about it
When we started fuckin' she promised we never talk about it
Bitches be for everybody, nigga why you trippin' 'bout it
Fuck a nigga bitch, now I can't even leave the crib without it
He a bitch about it
Yeah he a bitch about it it
Fucked a nigga bitch, now I can't even leave the crib without it
Yeah he a bitch about it

[Outro]
Every time I make another one, it's another one
Don't be all up on my french toast when that butter come
She tried to put me in the friend zone, but she wanted some

So wassup I'll make you fall in love with it

[Verse 1]
Fuck it, I'm goin' in now, watch what I do to this
Nobody told me this shit I had to get used to it
Niggas thinkin' I'm buggin', they think I'm losing it
Michael Jordan I'm ballin', they think I'm hoopin' it
She popped a perc and it's workin' so I go through with it
I sip a cup of the lean and then I go through with it
She moanin', screamin' and tell me keep on doin' it
I'm A Boogie, whats goodie, baby I'm true to this
I pulled up in my hoodie so you could know it's me
Ayo that's word to my F, it ain't a hoe in me
A nigga talk behind my back, that's a ho to me
A nigga gave me his word and then he told on me
He ain't really hold it down, how it's supposed to be
I should've put him in the ground, how its supposed to be
Bodies tryna get found while I'm rollin' weed
Ski mask, I'm hoping that they don't notice me
Choppa knock a nigga down on purpose
I'll pull up with a fuckin' Trey Pound on purpose (Ah)
Ra Sosa got a thottie on him twerkin'
Gotti with me waves lettin' niggas drown on purpose (Ah)
Nay Glizzy he a hound on purpose
That's my dog, I'll never let him down on purpose
Bubba told me go wild on purpose
Nigga why the fuck you think I'm goin' wild on 'em? (Ah)
I'm puttin' pain on 'em
Hollow tip, I let it rip
I let it rain on em'
Fuck a hook, I put a chain on 'em

I know that shit ain't been the same niggas
Change on you for the money and the fame

And she know wassup
And she know I keep a gun in the glove
And it's tough 'cause she hold it when I'm done with it

[Verse 2]
And I ain't even gon' lie
A lot of niggas say they gon' ride
They ain't really gon' ride
They don't want to be a homicide
So they callin' niggas bro
But they really playin' both sides
I don't trust a nigga, bottom line
And I don't trust a bitch, bottom line
Just because she on ya ride
That don't mean she ya ride or die
Your worst enemy could be right by your side (Hah)

[Chorus]
But I'm goin' up
Baby you ain't never fucked with a thug
So wassup, I'll -- I'll make you fall in -- yeah, baby

[Verse 1]
Any nigga couldn't sit in my chair

Louboutin shoes more than five pairs
You don't like me, what the fuck do I care?
I get money what the fuck do I care
I was posted on the block where
Try to rob and you get shot there

I go hard and I'ma rocket
I spent 13 on a wallet just a black card in the wallet
Fuck a car key push the start it
Thought I told y'all I'm an artist
Got a baddie in the valley out in Cali pushing gardens
Can't fuck with the extra shit
Every time I go out it's an extra bitch
Tryna get in my bed to have sex and shit
I just wanted some head like the exorcist
I got 99 problems and messages
Don't be asking me why I won't text you bitch
Wrap your legs around me like we wrestling
Get on your knees don't you be so damn hesitant
When I get your body I'ma be alright
And when I get a 'Rari you can be inside it
I'ma get another one and let you drive it
Baecation for an extra night
And I won't tell nobody all your secrets, I can keep a secret girl
I know you need somebody
And I really need somebody
So tell me you're that somebody, girl

[Bridge]
I think I might be too late but I'm sorry
I'm sorry baby, but you should thank me
Appreciate me, congratulate me

I'm really feeling the way that you moving
I just wanna know if you finna come through tonight
I can promise you that I'ma do you right
You gon' wish you can go back and do it twice
I can pick you up in an uber right
Get high on the way to a flight
Would you ride for me? Would you lie for me?
When you come around good vibes with me
I rock with you, do you rock with me?
I swear other bitches do not get me
Don't be scared baby this is my city
But just in case I keep a .9 with me
I was hoping you can grind with me
It gets lonely on this side baby
But can you stay the fuck off my Instagram
I don't know why my phone's always in your hand
Baby I try to get you to understand mind your business
You know I'm a businessman
I'ma give you the time of day when I can
Took a minute for me to be who I am
My finesse, I can turn a five to a ten
I been traveling, they don't know where I am

[Bridge]

[Intro]
You didn't tell me you love me until I said I loved you
But I didn't love you until after I fucked you
Are we both guilty? Do you feel me?
I was tryna go half and half with you on a baby
I must've been crazy to let you play me
Bitch, I'm too wavy, you can never replace me
And I can't take it, you was amazing
I would've went half and half with you on a baby

[Verse 1]
You was the one, I said I loved you so I fucked with you
I was hearing rumors, hoping that they wasn't true
You would call my phone thinking it was cool but you knew
Everything that you told me that you wasn't doing
You do girl, it was true girl
Now I got a couple new girls in my new world
Any different type of mood, I can pick and choose girls
Tell me what you wanna do, I can pick you up
In a two door, that's a new sport, come and hop in
All them niggas talking nonsense, they don't want this
Girl I prolly would've gave you anything you wanted
Girl I prolly would've put a baby in your stomach

[Chorus]
Half on a baby, Na Na Nah
Half on a baby, Na-Na Nah-Na
Half on a baby, Na-Na Nah Nah
Nah Na-Na Nah Na
Shawty, me, you, and a baby
Could've been me, you, and a baby
Half on a baby, on a baby
Half on a baby, on a, ha!

[Verse 2]
I told her the moment that I approached her
Come closer, I needed a little closure
Heart colder, I'm looking over my shoulder
Then I showed her something to make her come over
I put lemons in the jacuzzi, if you see
How I move, we might end up making a movie
Come through, see what I'm talking is really true things
We can do things, girl we can do things
If you wanna do it on the low, we can do it that's cool
But if you fuck it up that's you
I can cut you off in a second if you try to act new
Oh, I'll be throwing up my deuce, yeah

[Chorus]
Half on a baby, Na Na Nah
Half on a baby, Na-Na Nah-Na
Half on a baby, Na-Na Nah Nah
Nah Na-Na Nah Na
Shawty, me, you, and a baby
Could've been me, you, and a baby
Half on a baby, on a baby
Half on a baby, on a, ha!

Ness on the beat
What the fuck I'm supposed to say?
What the fuck I'm supposed to say? Ayy

[Chorus]
What the fuck I'm supposed to say?
Police pull me over, they ain't got nothing to say
I told 'em, "I got tints because I'm rich", they said, "Okay", ayy
Gotta pray a lot niggas get shot up everyday, ayy
Hold up, what the fuck I'm supposed to say?
Police pull me over, they ain't got nothing to say
I told 'em, "I got tints because I'm rich", they said, "Okay", ayy
Gotta pray a lot, niggas get shot up everyday, ayy
Heard you got a big body but a little face, ayy
Got a 41 bezel, it's 100K, ayy
If I feel a way then I'm gon' say it to your face, ayy
If I play the block today, I'll make 100K, ayy

[Verse 1]
Yeah, I just might make 100K, yeah
If they put a price on me, I'll double what they pay, yeah
They say they don't like me, give a fuck 'bout what they say, yeah
I could take your bitch and make you think about what you say, yeah
I'm gon' put her in a leg lock like MMA, yeah
I'm gon' let her give me head twice if she don't say shit
If she ever turn sherm on me then she basic
Couple bitches had to swerve on 'em, I updated
You pulled up with her, she ain't leave with who she came with
She deserve better, you's a bird, you's a wasteman
Fuck a umbrella, change weather in my spaceship
Diamonds dancing, I'm two-stepping with my bracelet
So, get the fuck up out my face
I'm just on my way to get this money and I'm late, okay
In the strip club throwing twenties like "I'll be okay"
100k a day, trap booming like an 808

[Chorus]
Yeah, what the fuck I'm supposed to say?
Police pull me over, they ain't got nothing to say
I told 'em, "I got tints because I'm rich", they said, "Okay", ayy
Gotta pray a lot niggas get shot up everyday, ayy
Heard you got a big body but a little face, ayy

Hold up, talking shit don't ever get to me
When they see me now, they'd better have that same energy
In abandoned houses, in and out, it wasn't shit to me
When you see me now, don't try to act like you remember me
Then look at me now, bitch I'm drowning
And my hoodie Saint Laurent, it's a thousand
And we come straight out the Bronx so we wildin'
Shoutout BK, free Bobby and free Rowdy
Free my nigga V12, holla if you see 12
Febreze, believe me, it'll cover the weed smell
I probably got 3 mil', sitting in my email
So much on me, they second guessing what we sell
So much money on me, fuck it if it's dirty money
'Cause I earned it, you get murked if you come searchin' for me
When the police pulled me over, I had 30 on me
What the fuck I look like with less than 30 on me, nigga?

[Chorus]
Yeah, what the fuck I'm supposed to say?
Police pull me over, they ain't got nothing to say
I told 'em, "I got tints because I'm rich", they said, "Okay", ayy
Gotta pray a lot niggas get shot up everyday, ayy
Heard you got a big body but a little face, ayy
Got a 41 bezel, it's 100K, ayy
If I play the block today, I'll make 100K, ayy
If I play the block today, I'll make 100K, yeah

[Outro]
I'll make her say a'
I'll make her say a'
I'll make her say a'

Hitmaka
Oh-oh, oh, yeah

[Verse 1: A Boogie wit da Hoodie]
Let's take a jet to Aruba, I know it sounds nice, ooh
You gon' fall into my trap, you gon' fall right through
Even when you're with your lover and your phone's on mute
When I call you an Uber, you gon' come right through
Need to cry you a river
If you lie, won't forgive you
And I won't ever, ever trust you
And I won't ever, ever miss you
And yeah I love my baby mother
But if she fuck another nigga
I won't ever, ever touch her
And don't you ever get it twisted
Yeah, I'ma cry me a river
Just get it out your system
You know how much I really want you
You know I'll never ever forget you
Way too much time spent on strippers
Ain't mean to cut you out the picture
I don't mean to be callin' you "bitch" and shit
But I be buggin' off the liquor
The muscle relaxant was workin'
Throwin' it back while she squirtin'
Don't need surgery, you're perfect
Remember when bitches was curvin'
Can't no nigga get you Birkins
Every time you think I'm lurkin'
All my clothes, you were burnin'
Oh that's how you feel? That's the word, yeah

[Chorus: A Boogie wit da Hoodie]
Come closer
All I ever needed was some closure
Come closer
All I ever needed was some

[Verse 2: Queen Naija]
You told me that you need some closure, you said come over
I don't need to take no Uber, I drive a Rover
Tryna bribe me with a bag, wait, nigga, hold up
If you ever try to play me, nigga, you's a whole dub, whole dub
Always got what I wanted
Never asked nobody for nothin'
I can take a trip to the islands alone
But if you want it you
Gotta come with somethin' new
I don't know what's wrong with you
So over your petty games, you're getting way too comfortable
Oh-oh, oh
Gettin' real comfortable treatin' me like a regular
Don't bring out the worst in me when I bring out the best in you
Boy, I ain't average
Don't make me turn savage
I need you to see that I'm no regular girl

[Chorus: A Boogie wit da Hoodie & Queen Naija]
Come closer (Oh-oh, oh-whoa)
All I ever needed was some closure (Needed some closure)
Come closer
All I ever needed was some closure (All I ever needed was some closure)

[Outro: A Boogie wit da Hoodie & Queen Naija]
Come closer, oh, oh (All I ever needed was some closure)

Puddles full of pain
All my friends gone, some in jail
Other niggas changed like a Drake song

But I'm going and I'm scoring
And I'm just making that shit count
When I gave these niggas chances
They kept turning that shit down

But when I turn around
They nowhere to be found
And I ain't with the drama (drama)

You know loyalty is everything until my fucking day come
Ain't it crazy how them niggas say they fucking with ya
Grab a pistol, bust it with ya
You go to work, they at ya crib tryna fuck ya sister
The ones close to you will do the most you
If it's bread on ya head I'll bet
They put that toaster to you
They look at you and smile though go half
With you on a bottle
Sip Hennessy and Moscato I ain't even 'gon lie tho
That's word to my nigga Quado
Rest in peace my nigga Quado
They call you bro and then leave you in the cold like Chicago
First they hate you then they love you
Then they, turn into a snake again
No new niggas, I'll never make that mistake again
They start off real cool, but once you see that they faking it
Take a picture nigga you might never see they face again

[Chorus]
Temporary, bitches be so temporary

And I feel like I'm
By accident

[Chorus]
I feel like I'm stalking you, I swear
I keep on watching your snaps, I'm stuck on your Instagram
And girl, I don't even follow you, I can't
Too busy calling you back, sometimes I don't understand

[Verse 1]
But girl, I feel like I walk past you, flexed on you by accident
I hopped in a Bentley, I don't plan on crashing it
I told you that I love you baby, I was gassin' it
Gold blunts rolled up, I ain't mashing it
Before you was my baby baby you was just a friend
And know that I was just in the streets hustlin'
They threw me in the jungle so I started bussin' licks
I ran into a mic and then I said, "Fuck the shit"
They call me young Mike, 'bout to get the glove and shit
Two diamond rings yea I paid a dub for it
Throw subs at me bet I don't respond to it
I'm countin' up money while you niggas commenting
Stuck on your ex and I can get you over it
VVS on my neck, let's come and see how cold it get
Before I sent you that message I was on my thirtieth sip
I was drinking a Sunkist and then I put the dirty in it

[Chorus]
And I swear, that's why I'm watching your snaps
I'm stuck on your Instagram
And girl, I don't even follow you, I can't
Too busy calling you back, sometimes I don't understand
I feel like I'm stalking you, I swear
I keep on watching your snaps, I'm stuck on your Instagram
And girl, I don't even follow you, I can't
Too busy calling you back, sometimes I don't understand
I feel like I'm

[Verse 2]
Should pick you up in my spaceship
You're way too good for me
I ran out of shit to say, she ask me questions all day
I can't keep making up stories
She said goodbye and left me in the cold
If I can't take it, I'm sorry
I need good vibes, if not, leave me alone
I swear I hate to see you walk away
But you look so damn good when you walk away
Do you ever think about stalkin' me
Cause I do just in case you been wondering

[Chorus]
And I swear, that's why I'm watching your snaps
I'm stuck on your Instagram
And girl, I don't even follow you, I can't
Too busy calling you back, sometimes I don't understand
I feel like I'm stalking you, I swear
I keep on watching your snaps, I'm stuck on your Instagram
And girl, I don't even follow you, I can't
Too busy calling you back, sometimes I don't understand
I feel like I'm

[Intro]
This don't usually happen like this, though, fuck it

[Verse]
I woke up to like ninety-nine missed calls
That's like ninety-nine people I probably pissed off
Like damn, nigga, I was on a jail call
Damn, niggas make me hate my cell phone
Like damn, my nigga, I'm in the studio
Last time I dropped an album was like a year ago
Yeah, you tellin' me you starving, but I been there though
Like growin' up, breakfast, lunch and dinner wasn't cereal
I know what's up
You just wanna be all in the videos and smoke it up
I know you ain't really with the shits but you just throw it up
Pretty bitches in my city litty, they just going up
Nigga, you just wanna be around me 'cause my money up
Heard them goofy niggas tryna line me, they don't want smoke with us
Had to pop an Addy, I was down, yeah, had to focus up
Most my niggas dogs, I hit up bitches that my homies fucked
I hear too much me in niggas' songs, so I had to switch it up, I had to switch it up
Pick out diamonds in particular 'cause I'm just rich as fuck
Rest in peace to that boy Trayvon, I got my hoodie up
They know exactly how we give it up, shoot a bully up
And you bitches know that I cannot waste no time
Bitch, I'm really grindin'
If I ever said, "I love you", never mind it
Especially when I feel like you out here thottin'
I threaten you, but I fuck with you, let's be honest
I hide the fact that I love to smoke on exotic
Flowers, I give you all my hours
I fuck around, I miss you though, I promise
Bonnie and Clyde issues, guns around us
No bozos in my circle, they get cut quick
We can't even get around, I got my hoodie on in public
House arrest in Florida, they always checked up on me
So when I was in the studio I said I was in Publix
If you could walk in my shoes, you could walk on water
Percocets like NyQuil, got me buying sawed-offs
Since I been in high school, I been feeling heartless
I swear I was like you, now look at me ballin'
10K on one fit, fly like I departed
Stay with that rocket, ooh, I go J. Harden
Can't tell if I got it, but I stay on it
And they stay frontin', but it ain't nothin'
'Cause I make money, talkin' big money
Mmh, if I go broke, stay away from me
Mmh, if I go broke, I'ma take money, yeah
I might go broke in my late hundreds
It's hard not to talk money 'cause I got money now
And these chains around my neck over two hundred thou
And Puma just gave me a budget, I should say, "Fuck it"
And give it to the schools 'cause they need it more than I need it now
Swear I paid my dues, I should speak up more though, I'm playin' quiet
Tryna keep it cool like the time I was in the studio with Future and his goons
Sittin' next to my favorite rapper, actin' scared to say it to him
Used to bump "March Madness," poppin' Addys because of you
After you and Drizzy dropped, then I got in tune (Yeah)
Drizzy, that's my broski, I appreciate you too, yeah
First time in the Garden, it was all because of you, yeah
I probably was OD-in' to do a song but I was new, yeah
I can't lie, oh, you was like my idol, ask my crew, yeah
Right when I thought viral was viral, Tekashi blew, yeah
And that's my nigga too, I fuck with you, I swear to God
Type of nigga keep that shit a hundred, cameras off
And I'm the type of nigga you might see in Saint Laurent
Different places, Cleveland, Miami, but I ain't LeBron
With different bitches, denims lookin' like they painted on
Listenin' to "D.T.B", yeah, that's our favorite song
I don't trust bitches
But you're just like me, that's why I don't trust bitches
This your favorite song
I don't love bitches
Fuck bitches, DTB, no, I don't trust bitches
This your favorite song
When you're home, all alone
Reminiscin' my Dior cologne
No going back, I really took your soul
I know, yeah
Woke up with the chills, oh, oh
Took a pill with my milk, oh, oh
Like it's not a big deal, oh, oh
Free all of my bros, whoa, oh
Free my nigga PeeWee, free my nigga Skills, now
Man, you gotta see me, see how I came up now
Used to wear the same shit, I ain't lookin' like no bum now
I'm a New York nigga, hangin' laces off my Uptowns
Grew up in the jungle where they rumblin' for dust now
Runnin' 'round the BX, RIP to Big Pun, now
And I don't know why
I feel like they wanna take my life
And it's all

[Outro]
Wanna fuck my wife
And these niggas wanna take my life
And it's all
Yeah, it's alright
And it's alright
Yeah, it's alright, mmh

Before I tried to fuck you I wish I knew that I would love you
I would've never told you come through
You shot me down so now it's fuck you
You took a 38 special well I'ma show you what this Tec do
You pulled the trigger cause I let you
When I shoot back I won't miss

Laces hang off my shoe that's how I rock my Loubs
And if you rock with me rock with me I could be honestly popping these bitches in line for me
I'm rocking Balmain jeans
They more than 14 a piece
If you seen what I seen you might turn M.O.E

[Chorus]
She held it down when I was down
That's why I still fuck with you
I was in love with you
You was my ride or die bitch
Baby wassup with you

[Chorus: Juice WRLD]
Don't get on my bad side, I'm dangerous

[Intro]
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na

If Young Metro don't trust you, I'm gon' shoot you

[Chorus]
I think them niggas is scared of us
Flexing but only for cameras
Nothing these niggas could do to us
Who the fuck can they compare to us?
Nothing these niggas could say to us

Look at my chain, I embarrass 'em
Fuck it, it ain't no comparison

[Verse 1]
These niggas ain't catching up to us
I swear these niggas need stamina
I broke her heart in a paragraph, turned to a thottie to cure it up
Now that bitch feel so embarrassing
Diamonds be dancing, I blur it up
Your shit is fake, you can't swear to it
I know you fronting, you panicking, I get dressed up like a mannequin
Put on a fit and embarrass 'em, it's so embarrassing
I put this beat on my body list
Metro a beast, yeah, he bodied it, they tried to give me a stylist
I told 'em I'm good, yo, you wylin'
I got sick of wearing Versace, I want red bottoms
Don't let me get in a fight with 'em
One of them spikes and I might hit him
I'm from the jungle, say that you fuck with gorrilas
I know that you niggas be lying
I gotta stay humble, that's why I fuck with the realest
I swear I put that on the Bible
You stuck in your feelings, say I'm fucking on your bitch
And you should've never ever wifed her
That's word to my mother, if a nigga take my bitch, fuck it
I'ma find another lover, we flex on each other
Cuban dripping on my wrist, I could put whatever on the other
That's word to my mother

[Chorus]
I think them niggas is scared of us
Flexing but only for cameras
Nothing these niggas could do to us
Who the fuck can they compare to us

Look at my chain I embarrass 'em
Fuck it, it ain't no comparison

[Verse 2]
You gotta be kidding me
Most of my shit come from Italy, W up, make 'em sick of me
Ice on my pinky too glittery
Pass on a show, it ain't shit to me
I keep a blicky, just in case a nigga with me ain't with me
And I see a enemy, everything litty
Plus my fingers kinda sticky from rolling up that icky icky
Them cookies be hitting
Beam came with the strap, ladder hanging off of that
Yeah I get two attached
I ain't fucking with the Act', I be tripping off of that
I'ma keep it a stack
Mike Amiri's on me stretch
But I'm holding all this bread, I'ma keep me a bag
They was saying I was next
Ever since I hit the booth and I jumped on a track

[Chorus]
I think them niggas is scared of us
Flexing but only for cameras
Nothing these niggas could do to us
Who the fuck can they compare to us

He got too close, he had a hoodie on, he wanted a picture
He ain't even think that I was about to smoke him like a fucking swisher
I can't afford it, I got a daughter, you won't catch me slippin'
Yeah, shit been gettin' realer, I been gettin' richer
What I just spent up on my neck could pay a bitch tuition

Everybody turn yo power off if yo phone's on
Hoe you gon' get slapped up in yo shit using the wrong tone
PnB got all us Milly Rocking with his song on
A Boogie just walked up in the party with his hoodie on
You know me, rollin' off a pill, strapped up with that chrome
Ho, don't walk up smilin' in my face if I can't take you home

[Verse 1]
Nigga don't tell me what you want
Think you calling shots? I make a call, nigga get you gone
Knew that was your girl but she a ho and her pussy soak
Sound like macaroni in a bowl when she mix it up
Knew I was gon' put it in the song
We ain't get to fuck
Think about when you leave her home
Where she really at?
Probably got location on your phone, she know where you at
A lot of niggas hatin' on the boy
Why you really mad?
Is it 'cause I'm really putting on where my city at
Highbridge, nigga from the Bronx where it be gritty at
I be smoking on gorilla glue and smoking GG pack
They don't wanna free my nigga Nun but I know he be back

[Chorus]
Bitches that I hit up in the DM never hit me back
Now they probably all up in my DM, I don't get to check
I could turn your girl into a demon, boy, don't get me mad
Fuck around and threw out all my singles when I heard it clap
Sound like macaroni in a bowl how she getting wet
When I met her said she was a fuckin' bartender, yeah
Then I saw her dancing on a pole, she a stripper, yeah
Macaroni in a bowl, she be mixing, yeah

[Verse 2]
My nigga don't tell me what to do
Mel went to school for shooting hoops and then he learned to shoot
Had to lock myself inside the booth, that's how I kept my cool
Saw my nigga Quado on the news, that's why I kept my tool
Don't you try to tell me nothing, nigga, you don't know me
Done with this bottle, fill me up I need another Ros'
Got to hit a couple hittas up when I'm by my lonely
I think they already know wassup, I don't fuck with phonies
Lately I been running out of time, I need another Rollie
Lately I been on the west-side, don't need no other homies
Diamonds on my pinky finger blinding, all the bitches on me
I look at her and tell her call me, hold up matter fact

[Chorus]
Bitches that I hit up in the DM never hit me back
Now they probably all up in my DM, I don't get to check
I could turn your girl into a demon, boy, don't get me mad
Fuck around and threw out all my singles when I heard it clap
Sound like macaroni in a bowl how she getting wet
When I met her said she was a fuckin' bartender, yeah
Then I saw her dancing on a pole, she a stripper, yeah
Macaroni in a bowl, she be mixing, yeah

[Outro]
Macaroni in a bowl
The way she mix it up
The way she mix it in a bowl
The way she mix it up
Macaroni in a...mix it up

[Chorus]
So, I took her on a baecation
She fell in love with the way I tasted
I fell in love with the way she take it
Go down on me girl, I know you wanna taste it
I took her on a baecation
We ain't even really dating
I spent a long time waiting
Go down on me girl, I know you want

[Verse 1]
My name is Artist, I can draw shit
She be all up in my phone, she just wanna start shit
She will not leave me alone till I take her shopping
Louis bag with a stash and her Birkin wallet
Yeah, let's go on a baecation
Baby, we can go to Vegas and change locations
Don't you worry bout a hater, they gon' keep hating
They sendin' shots, I just dodge like I'm in the Matrix
Used to scoop her up in a Uber
Now we taking flights, spending nights in Aruba
I hope we can do a lot of things, fuck the rumors
On the beach, Henny Coladas in the cooler
All the hoes gon' follow, understand that
If you end up heart broken I didn't plan that
I wanna take you so far I don't know where to begin at
Baby girl at least you know where my head at

[Chorus]
So, I took her on a baecation
She fell in love with the way I tasted
I fell in love with the way she take it
Go down on me girl, I know you wanna taste it
I took her on a baecation
We ain't even really dating
I spent a long time
Go down on me girl, I know you want

[Verse 2]
I could put you on, I won't do you wrong baby
You know what you're doing, I just hope you don't play me
Louis Vuitton don, you know I be going crazy
Go to San Juan, put you on the front page and
If they hate girl, fuck 'em they can stay hating
You can whip the Benzi, let 'em watch us racing and
When they hear me on the radio station
They gon' wish that they was you but I ain't replacing
My bitch so expensive
She listen to me but she never listen
They tried to push me off my pivot but I'm never tripping
She never bitch and love to kick it, Rose sipping
I fuck with you but girl don't get it twisted
It's money over everything so I be getting chicken
I'm hard to get with so they never gon to catch me slipping
Put you on a private jet, fuck a plane ticket

[Chorus]
So, I took her on a baecation
She fell in love with the way I tasted
I fell in love with the way she take it
Go down on me girl, I know you wanna taste it
I took her on a baecation
We ain't even really dating
I spent a long time
Go down on me girl, I know you want

[Chorus]
I just wanna stack dough, count more, I don't know niggas
You ain't my bro, you a hoe so you just don't get it
Bitches really tripping, if you looking for a check go get it
Bitch, I'm the wrong nigga
You fucking with the wrong nigga
I'm the wrong nigga
You fucking with the wrong nigga
I'm the wrong wrong nigga

[Verse 1]
Here's a couple words for you just in case you really don't get it
I can scoop any bitch I want but I wasn't gon' sweat it
Write me every minute wondering if I'm gon' be there already
I put it in a song cause I couldn't fit it all in one message
So I know she gon' get it, I know she gon' get it
I don't put my time into the bitches they be tripping
I bet they wish they can all get me
I make you feel so special, I know this already
I know I'm fucked up but it's still fucked up how it happened now you gone baby
I, treated you so wrong baby, now how can we get along baby
I can't help it I've been selfish I know I was wrong baby
What the fuck was you expecting, I'm moving on now baby
I did what I did, now I gotta move on cause I feel like you just gone play me

[Chorus]
I just wanna stack dough, count more, I don't know niggas
You ain't my bro, you a hoe so you just don't get it

You fucking with the wrong nigga

[Verse 2]
Don't cross the line tryna line me
Dumb nigga lost his mind while he was thinking 'bout it
I wrote every single song, don't try to copy
Fuck a nigga baby moms for tryna plagiarize me
My ex bitch so bad that she ain't around me
My ex bitch so mad, made a mistake about me
I know you probably can't sleep, you couldn't lay without me
Oh it's so so sad that you ain't around me
Can't believe I really made a whole tape about you
I made a song just to let you know I think about you
I don't even drink but everyday I drink about you
But, nowadays I don't give a fuck about you
Now I got a baddie sitting up in my coupe
Married to the money motherfucker "I do"
I'm rocking Buscemi even though I like Loubs
So you gotta use a key to walk in my shoes
They tryna keep up like the fuck do I do
Keeping it 100 like 50 times 2

[Outro]
I was the wrong nigga, wrong, wrong
Fucking with the wrong nigga
Wrong, wrong wrong
Wrong nigga, wrong nigga
Wrong nigga, wrong nigga
Wrong nigga wrong nigga, wrong nigga

I heard a couple niggas tryna line me
It ain't hard to find me

And if they catch a body, I swear I won't tell nobody
I got Balmain on my body, diamonds dancing on my body
Muller cooler than your jeweler, Elliot Avianne
She wanna fuck while my song play
I wanna know why they salty
I had to get it the hard way
Yeah nigga that's what they all say
I had to give up on college
I would've been trapping in hallways
I'm ballin', you know you can't stop it
Crossover, get 'em off me
I ain't got time for this shit, I'm a monster at this, nigga I grind for this shit
I can't just sleep with a bitch, you gotta watch who you hit, first get the drop on a bitch
Louis Vuitton on my hip, forty-five on my hip

[Verse 2: PnB Rock]
Everybody wanna know now, everybody wanna know how
How a young nigga came up, I'm supposed to be broke now
Coming through looking like I hit a lick
Dare you to try me cause I got that stick
Killing these haters, I'm making them sick
I just bought some new Chanel for my bitch
Bands all in my pockets
I'm taking off like a rocket
I'm the plug, no socket
I need all my profits
I need all my checks
Bitches on me cause they know I'm next
She just sent a naked picture through the text
I don't want the pussy, I just want the neck
All I know is flex, diamonds on my neck
I'm the fuckin' best, nigga what's the bet?
I just copped a new laser for this TEC
Treat you like a bitch, pussy you get wet
Cause I ain't got time to be playin' with y'all
You from where I'm from then you know that it's hard
I swear I told y'all that I'm not a star
It's still fuck the law and free all of my dogs

[Verse 1: A Boogie wit da Hoodie]
Would I be trippin'
If I tell you I'm different 'cause everyone's different? (Everyone's different)
But look, I'm somethin' different
Melody gifted, you are my witness
Louboutin Christians, givin' me blisters
I'm sinnin', but I miss you, and girl, do you miss me?
What's the difference between fuckin' and kissin'?
If you ain't with it, then we can just kick it (Kick it)
Fuck all the kissin'
We should just get into switchin' positions (Positions)
Fuckin' and kissin', fuckin' and kissin', girl, fuckin' and kissin'
Girl, do you miss me? You trippin', 'cause I miss you

[Chorus: A Boogie wit da Hoodie]
Fuckin' and kissin', fuckin' and kissin', girl, fuckin' and kissin' (Oh no)
Fuck me and kiss me, like you miss me, I know you miss it (Oh no)

Fuck me and kiss me, like you miss me 'cause I know you miss it (Oh no)

[Verse 2: A Boogie wit da Hoodie]
Next time I fuck you, I don't want you to say, "I love you"
And next time you suck it, don't touch it
Do somethin' that's gon' make me cum quick
I wanna see how you bust it
But if you start buggin'
I'ma fall back and start actin' like I never met you
My money bigger, if I take your bitch
Man, I don't mean to be disrespectful, I'm just that nigga

[Verse 3: Chris Brown]
Would I be trippin'
If I DM your friends and fuck all your bitches?
Would it be ignant?
You say I'm trippin' but they the ones with it
I thought it was love
'Til you went out tellin' our business
Lyin' when you know you did it
Cryin' but don't see no tears
I guess we really all guilty
Fake friends all circle 'round me
You wanna show everybody 'round me how I bleed
Plead, the truth, will set you free

[Chorus: A Boogie wit da Hoodie]
Fuckin' and kissin', fuckin' and kissin', girl, fuckin' and kissin'
Fuck me and kiss me, like you miss me, I know you miss it
Fuckin' and kissin', fuckin' and kissin', girl, fuckin' and kissin'
Fuck me and kiss me, like you miss me 'cause I know you miss it

[Intro]
A Boogie wit da Hoodie, damn you be flexing (Flexing)
They want you for ransom (Ransom)

[Chorus]
It's a whole lotta ways I can get my cash up
Nigga, you ain't got no backup, you should back up
All the hoes say I'm handsome, I got my bands up
I got bands, now my head up for a ransom
It's a whole lotta ways I can get my cash up
Nigga, you ain't got no backup, you should back up
All the hoes say I'm handsome, I got my bands up

Nigga, you ain't got no backup, you should back up
All the hoes say I'm handsome, I got my bands up

Nigga, I ain't put no cash up but it's back up
I just stay with my head up and my grass cut
Them snakes got me fed up, I need a handgun
I got bands now my head up for a ransom

[Verse 2]

'Member makin' tracks with Kodak
Then we fell a little off-track
I'm a street nigga way before rap
I ain't been the type to name drop
But it's some shit that I can't hold back
I heard a nigga from the same block
Is telling on me, I expose rats
Look I don't really want no beef with no niggas
I don't want no enemies or no niggas
The feds is coming, and they sweepin' on niggas
They gained like seven, took like three of my niggas
Ain't no static, it's just defense on niggas
Go black on black, go Hoodie SZN on niggas
Plaques on plaques, I got thirteen of them, nigga
One day I wanna be a king like I'm Jigga

[Chorus]
But I ain't ready for no love yet
All I ever want is drug sex
I'm used to being in the projects
Mama saying I was up next
Learnin' how to fucking rob, yeah
I didn't even touch a gun yet
Most the niggas I grew up with
Are sitting up, or either gone, yeah

[Verse 2]
Gone, yeah
When I'm right, I think I'm wrong, yeah
This is just where I belong, yeah
I'm so used to having fun (Yeah)
I go straight from the Ave to in the club
Catch me right in the back
Cameras on me, they be all on my ass
But Sal in front of me to cover the gas
But don't get too gassed, my life is too fast
Bitches tellin' me to follow them back
Adderall, at least it's better than Xans
Pop a Perc and fuck for hours again
'Cause I don't want no fuckin' love sex
All I want from you is drug sex
Shit you wouldn't do in public
You say you ain't the type to suck dick
You never finished, it was perfect
Your natural titties and your curves, yeah
I make you feel like it was worth it
I can buy you all the Birkins

[Chorus]
But what's next?
I don't want no fuckin' love sex
All I want from you is drug sex
I don't wanna make you up'
I don't wanna see you upset
All I want from you is drug sex
But your love is like a drug, yeah
I can never get enough

[Outro]
Fuck love sex
Can we have drug sex?
Fuck love sex, can we have drug sex?
Fuck love sex, can we have drug, drug, drug, drug

Watchin' crack heads squeeze up on that needle
I said I'm sorry for makin' you feel I need you
Love hoes, windows, bitch you see through
Smokin' endo outdoors with my people
I don't eat cheese, my nigga, no that's illegal
I don't like dogs who fuck with you when they need you
Y'all are not low, my nigga, already peeped you
I do not know you, don't say wassup to me
When I needed it, you didn't show no love to me
Don't want no company
Fuck you, fuck you, aha!

[Chorus: A Boogie]
We ride together, we ride together, be honest
The only time I'm feeling fine is when I'm with my bitch

Hit that thing raw just to make her feel special
Several phone calls just to make her feel special
Do that think I like cause you know I still let you, ah!

Ah! Girl pull up on me

I cannot love on no skeezer
That is a dub, I don't need her
I hit her once, then I leave her
Blow up my phone for no reason
I cheated on you with a dancer
Okay, I surrender, my hands up
At least I admit it, I man up
I do not have all the answers
And I gotta stay with the nine these days
Bitches that get niggas lined these days
And I am not with all the drama, ayy

Jump inside the water, ride the wave, yeah

[Verse 1]
Up to no goodie, I put on my hoodie
Got sick of Margielas, got rid of the Truey
And I'm on a private jet gettin' some pussy
Givenchy, Givenchy, my luggage is Louis
Don't wanna stress you, no, baby, I just wanna sex you
Undress you, don't wanna caress you
Don't wanna tell you I love you if I do not mean it
Them niggas will say that to hit you
I love you, I hate you, I don't want you back now
Go through some things that you cannot take back now
I reach out to people who don't reach me back now
I need you, I need you, it's too late, I'm mad now
I spazzed out, they backed out, the mag now, they sat down
I love my life more than I love my lifestyle
I love my ice, how it shine even when the lights out
She pulled my lights out but I swear, no I

[Chorus]
I cannot love on no skeezer
That is a dub, I don't need her

She had my heart it was real cold, I took it back 'cause the bitch stole
And you never know what a bitch knows, I can't be lovin' no ho, oh

[Chorus]
She used to call me her daddy
Told her I can't fall in love now she, damn

Plus she won't stop throwing subs at me
She just wanna see me unhappy

[Verse 1]
But instead I'm in a Lamborghini
With a tint, my windows tinted like I care who see me
If I tell you all my secrets, it won't be a secret
But if I tell you a secret, I hope that you can keep it
Mike Amiri denims, couldn't fit the fucking ratchet
I'm with a shooter, sorry, if he gotta fucking bag niggas
Started calling me the GOAT, I came up from the grass, nigga
I got water on my wrist, I told her look at that river
I wanna act like I don't know you now
My niggas told me I should expose you now
But she used to hold it down
Just hold it down, just hold it down

[Chorus]
She used to call me her daddy
Told her I can't fall in love now she, damn
She upset, she throwing subs at me
She just wanna see me unhappy

Plus she won't stop throwing subs at me
She just wanna see me unhappy

[Verse 2]
She wanna be my baby, but she can't take it, ah
I only wear this chain for special occasions
I be talking too much money, that's a different language
And I started losing friends when I got famous
If it don't make a dollar, then it don't make sense, amen
I be stuffing hundreds in Melody piggy bank
I'm that nigga, yeah, I wish a nigga would these days
I got rich but I still go back to the hood these days
And honestly
I be tryna stop thinking about you but even when I do
I be reminiscing bad things I did
And I know you hate me, you hate me

[Chorus]
She used to call me her daddy
Told her I can't fall in love now she, damn
She upset, she throwing subs at me
She just wanna see me unhappy
She used to say, "what's up, daddy"
Now she walk past me with a mug, she keep calling me a dub
Plus she won't stop throwing subs at me
She just wanna see me unhappy

While we on the topic, let's talk about it
You gon' find somebody better, yeah shawty I doubt it
You knew I was ballin', you was tryna scout it
You just played the sideline, I was tryna out it
Pulled up in the Audi, I did it proudly
Put them diamonds in my mouthpiece, smokin' loudly
At this moment she realized she couldn't live without me
Told her, "Hop up in the sky before this shit get cloudy"
Don't you doubt me, 'cause I be spendin' dividends
I been out and switchin' into them different Benzes
Got my dollars up and dipped and onto ya friendses
Rollie on me, presidential like the president, bitch
Only you know I won't try you, why would I try to?
Every city that I fly through, I try to fly you
When you look just like the pictures I just can't deny you
Now let me beat that pussy red like it was bangin' Piru
Girl you know I wanna dine you, I'ma line you
Fuck around and make me wanna put you in a spiral, hit your spinal
Touchin' you like I was tryna spin a vinyl

Yeah, come do it all for me, 'cause I do it all for you

Buy my whip by myself, pay my rent by myself
Only exes that I care about are in my fucking chromosomes

Bad bitch, diamonds in my collarbone (Yee, yee)
Buy my whip by myself, pay my rent by myself

[Intro]
True story
No glory, let's go

[Verse 1]
Yeah, the old me used to love a Gemini
Like a threesome, fuckin' with him every night
A lotta two-faced people show me both sides
So I figured out I gotta be my own type

[Pre-Chorus 1]
They used to say to get a man, you had to know how to look
They used to say to keep a man, you had to know how to cook
But I'm solo in Soho, sippin' Soju in Malibu
It's a me, myself kinda attitude

I know how to love me (Love me)
I know that I'm always gonna hold me down
Yeah, I'm my own soulmate (Yeah, yeah)

We always get extra fries
And you know the sex is fire
And I gotta testify
I get flowers every Sunday
I'ma marry me one day

[Pre-Chorus 2]
True love ain't something you can buy yourself
True love finally happens when you by yourself
So if you by yourself, then go and buy yourself
Another round from the bottle on the higher shelf

I know how to love me (Love me)
I know that I'm always gonna hold me down

Poor little baby
Who told you that you stood a chance with this royalty?
You're so sweet, bless your heart
Can't let a pretty face distract me from business
And God as my witness, your ugly ass won't either
I'm sorry, 2 AM photos with smileys and hearts
Ain't the way to my juicy parts
Boy, thank me later, looks good on paper
But love isn't easy, so I'll do the hardest part

Jerome, Jerome
Go on, take your ass home
And come back when you're grown
Jerome, ooh, Jerome
Go on, take your ass home
Where the peaches have thorns

Or you don't deserve a good person to carry your baggage
I know a few girls that can handle it
I ain't that kind of chick, but I can call 'em for you if you want
I never said that you wasn't attractive
Your style and that beard, ooh, don't get me distracted
I'm tryna be patient, and patience takes practice
The fact is I'm leaving, so just let me have this

[Chorus]
Jerome, Jerome
Take your ass home
And come back when you're grown, oh
Jerome, ooh, Jerome
Go on, take your ass home
Where the peaches have thorns

Where the hell my homies went?
How I'm 'posed to get home?
How I'm 'posed to get home?
Walking home with my feet on sore
Walking home with my feet on sore
What the hell these Louboutins for?
What the hell these Louboutins for?
Walking home and it's damn near 4
Walking home and it's damn near 4
What the hell these Louboutins for?
What the hell these Louboutins for?
Yeah, I was getting it, looking real cute
Up in the club, man, how do you do?
Hair ain't a don't, hair is a do
Ooh, he fine! What's up with you?

[Chorus]
Where the hell my phone? Where the hell my phone?
Where the hell my, where the hell my phone, huh?
How I'm 'posed to get home?
Where the hell my phone? Where the hell my phone?
Where the hell my, where the hell my phone, huh?

Ooh, unlock that, all up in my contacts
Hoo, unlock that, all up in my contacts
Hoo, unlock that, all up in my contacts
Hoo, unlock that, all up in my contacts
Oh my god, why?

[Verse 2]
Yeah, and I seen that boy
Looked at me, but I got annoyed
'Cause he bought me a drink for a dolla'
Boy came over and he wanted to holla'
Boy came over and he wanted to holla'
Boy came over and he wanted to holla'
My song came on, so I hit the dance floor
Man I lost my, mmm, phone
Walking home with my feet on sore
Walking home with my feet on sore
What the hell these Louboutins for?
What the hell these Louboutins for?
Walking home and it's damn near 4
Walking home and it's damn near 4
What the hell these Louboutins for?
I don't know where I'm going

[Chorus]
Where the hell my phone? Where the hell my phone?
Where the hell my, where the hell my phone, huh?
How I'm 'posed to get home?

Where the hell my, where the hell my phone, huh?
How I'm 'posed to get
But you're holding it
Oh

Pull this car over, babe
Don't pretend like you don't know
A lot of girls have time for this shit
Honestly, I don't

[Pre-Chorus 1]
He said, "Why you cryin', baby?
Why you cryin', baby?
What did I do?" Oh
I said, shut up and kiss me, oh
'Cause I don't wanna be here for long

[Chorus]
I swore you'd never see this side
But it's so hard to say goodbye
I don't need to apologize
Us big girls gotta cry

[Post-Chorus]
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh

[Verse 2]
You should feel honored boy, uh
You got me feelin' this much
I clear my schedule for you
Let my guard down for you
And you gon' make me put it back up

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Oh, you know why I'm cryin'
Why I'm cryin', baby
You don't pick up the phone
You do the same thing to your friends and family
You gon' end up alone

[Chorus]
I swore you'd never see this side
But it's so hard to say goodbye
I don't need to apologize
Us big girls got to cry

[Post-Chorus]
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh

[Bridge]
It feels so good, so good sometimes
Some big girls gotta cry
After this is done, just take me home
I'm feelin' vulnerable
I don't need to apologize
Us big girls gotta cry

[Outro]
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
Ooh, it's my life
You know it hurts sometimes
My love is your love
Why can't your love be mine?
Ooh, ooh
Oh, I get a little lost sometimes
Sometimes you need to cry

[Chorus: Lizzo]
That's exactly how I feel
That's exactly how I feel
That's exactly how I feel

[Verse 1: Lizzo]
I woke up this morning (God)
Wrong side of the bed
I don't have to 'splain it, oh (How I feel)
I might be a bitch (Bitch)
I might make a friend (Friend)
Ain't I so amazing? (Uh-huh)

[Pre-Chorus: Lizzo]
Love me or hate me
Ooh, I ain't changing
And I don't give a fuck, no

[Chorus: Lizzo]
That's exactly how I feel (Uh)
That's exactly how I feel (Say it again)

Don't hide no emotions (Emotions)

I feel like hurtin' they feelings (Yeah)
I don't get mad, I get millions (Yeah)
My heart ain't got no feelings
My cars ain't got no ceiling
I ain't with that acting all friendly
Please step away from the Bentley
You're either not with me or with me
The fye close by like it's Whitney
Stay in your lane, don't tempt me
Mr. Bust-A-Whole-Clip-'Til-It's-Empty
I got a feelin' that tonight's gonna be a good night
Like Ferg and them said, god willing
Fire chains on like burr (Burr)
Feelin' like rockin' my fur (Fur)
Rolls Royce with the chauffeur (Huh?)
How your toes feel on a mink fur?
It's Gucci

[Pre-Chorus: Lizzo]
Cry 'cause I want to
Smile if I want to, huh
Yes, I can
Love 'cause I want to
Get so mad I could scream (I could scream)
I could scream (I could scream)
I could scream (Sing it)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Chorus: Lizzo]
That's exactly how I feel (How I feel)
That's exactly how I feel (How I feel)

Woo, I'm lit, don't mess with it
Woo, stand back, let me do my shit
Woo, I'm lit, don't mess with it, woo

Hands to the sky, show me that you're mine
Hands to the sky, show me that you're mine

Feel that lightning down in my soul
And if you wanna feel the thunder, baby
Better let me know
Let me know

[Pre-Chorus]
Woo, I'm lit, don't mess with it
Woo, stand back, let me do my shit
Woo, I'm lit, don't mess with it

[Chorus]
Hands to the sky, show me that you're mine
Hands to the sky, show me that you're mine
And baby, worship me
Worship me (Uh-huh)
On your knees
Patiently, quietly, faithfully, worship me

[Bridge]
Oh, here it goes, okay
Stop and smell my roses, posies
Appreciate my poses, they know
I'ma fanfare like the star-spangled
Oh, say, can you see my angles?
'Cause I'm hotter than the, I'm hotter than the stovetop
You can put your kettle on, but I'ma make the thing pop
No, I ain't talkin' 'bout my word, just my work
You can add it all up while I'm beefin' up my purse

[Chorus]
Hands to the sky, show me that you're mine (Make me believe it)
Hands to the sky, show me that you're mine (Oh, yeah)
And baby, worship me (Worship me)
Worship me (Get it together, make it feel good)
On your knees
Patiently, quietly, faithfully, worship me

And you high off that doobie doobie with your Mystery Machine (Scooby)

Lookin' holy holy while looking through them holy holies
Holy guacamole, you got that gooey now you a phony

[Verse 2: Sophia Eris]
Outside of the club
And I'm drip-drip-dripping sugar sweet
Cinnamon on skin with the hooligans
Y'all came to rock, and we came to ah!
Put a sting in her lips, [?] for the eye
Go on, take a sip, got milk in her thighs
[?] on sunny day from green tube and my high prices for the
Dream-dream, not cause i mean it means a thing to take from me
Unless it's just some DMT that's all up in my energy
Yup yup, go on place that bet
If you wanna come test in the mama's nest
With a bullet vest and curious chest
Got the ammo on the brain but I hide the best
Hey, I'm pumped up call me dough cooking
Gooey salty soul tookin', batches in a row lookin'
Magic as all hell, we livin', never ever will we give in
To a wack beat fuck with Lazerbeak in these mad streets
Get it, go there and we give it, haters will forbid it
They fall into the minutes because of imagination
Now the ones who in the nation, we the ones who need escapin'
Then we find some new ovens and we made it

[Verse 3: Lizzo]
Six-pence and land on the richer
Cut a niggah up and hung him like Jack the Ripper
Undo your zipper, get on your knees
And get ready for the industry in a nutshell (get it?)
Them goods don't get got if it's the only thing you got
Better keep them in that hot black pot
The only thing colder than the local talent, are the winters
Thrift store shopping, look like Anna Wintour
You ain't gotta ask about it cause I been hurr
Ridin' in them chariots like we in Ben Hur
Yah sure, ya know, yah sure, ya know, yah sure, ya know...
Rappin' and rappin' and I been steadily stackin'
I put these niggas in napkins and tuck 'em down for a nap
And apologies to the Capitol because I don't pay my capital
And if you happen to hear this then just pretend that you didn't at all, stall

[Hook]
I got my batches and cookies, I got my batches and cookies
I got my batches and cookies, I got my batches and cookies
Got my batches and cookies, I got my batches and cookies
I got my batches and cookies, I got my what?
I got my batches and cookies, I got my batches and cookies
I got my batches and cookies, I got my batches and cookies
Got my batches and cookies, I got my batches and cookies
I got my batches and cookies, I got my what?

[Outro]
Ooh, goo, cookies, cream
Ooh, goo, cookies, cream

[Intro]
(Yeah)
Damn

[Verse 1]
Hair down, moonlit
Look at my lipstick
So thick, so fit
Wanna put your lips in places, ooh
The sun don't shine there
I like that right there (I like that)
Keep goin' and goin' and keep it flowin', uh
You know what you doin', don't you?

[Chorus]
So I lounge around in my lingerie
I wanna be prepared for you just in case
So I lounge around in my lingerie
You better come my way

[Verse 2]
I don't got no secrets you don't know
These panties are see-through, I'm exposed, yeah
Treat you with my body, my eyes closed
Baby, let me feel you close
You make me crescendo, I'm going up
Ooh, ooh, ooh, yeah
Let's open the window
And let the world know
Oh, oh, oh

[Chorus]
So I lounge around in my lingerie
I wanna be prepared for you just in case
So I lounge around in my lingerie
You better come my way

[Chorus: Lizzo]
Let 'em say what they gonna say
They gon' feel how they gonna feel
And I love it
I love it and baby
Hey, you should too

[Chorus: Caroline Smith]
So let 'em say what they gonna say
They gonna feel how they gonna feel
But I love it
I love it, baby
Hey, you should too

[Verse 1: Lizzo]
I'm just as thick as my skin is
I feel the water rolling down my back
Precipitation's so repetitive
I read this all before
Interrogation to my hometown
Your comments leave me such a nasty taste
Can't feel the sound
Swish all around
A palate-cleanser for your salty mouth

[Pre-Chorus]
I know they'll never get enough
They don't get it, they don't get it
But if you're giving in then don't you change
Cause living well's the best revenge

[Chorus]
So let 'em say what they gonna say
They gonna feel how they gonna feel
But I love it
I love it, baby
Hey, you should too

Don't pay them no mind

[Verse 2: Caroline Smith]
I'm not as thick as my skin is
Trying to stay strong
Stay tuned out at the top but
When you're running the business
I wish it was easy
Trying to work like a boss but
They keep shaking my patience
Don't wanna think like a man
Or look like a model
I wanna look like my momma
Five foot two and a natural woman

[Pre-Chorus]
I know they'll never get enough
They don't get it, they don't get it
But if you're giving in then don't you change
Cause living was the best revenge

[Chorus]
So let 'em say what they gonna say
They gonna feel how they gonna feel
But I love it
I love it, baby
Hey, you should too

[Chorus]
Independent, athletic
I been sweating, doing calisthenics
Booty vicious, mind yo business
I been working, working on my fitness

[Verse 1]
I've been lifting heavy metal
See this ass? Ain't no rental
Take it down low like just stretching
Pick it back up like I'm flexing
Woo, tryna get it, working on my fitness

[Pre-Chorus]
Think about how I'm gonna feel when I step up on the catwalk
Think about how I'm gonna feel when I got that ass that don't stop
That ass that don't stop, that ass don't stop
And think about how I'm gonna feel when I take it all off

[Chorus]
Independent, athletic
I been sweating, doing calisthenics
Booty vicious, mind yo business
I been working, working on my fitness

[Post-Chorus]
Toot toot, beep beep
Toot toot, beep beep
I been working, working on my fitness

[Verse 2]
Ooh, work my body like
Ooh, I know you want it like
Ooh, but I don't do this for you

[Pre-Chorus]
Think about how I'm gonna feel when I step up on the catwalk
Think about how I'm gonna feel when I got that ass that don't stop
That ass that don't stop, that ass don't stop
And think about how I'm gonna feel when I take it all off
But I don't do this for you

[Chorus]
Independent, athletic
I been sweating, doing calisthenics
Booty vicious, mind yo business (Better mind yo business)
I been working, working on my fitness (I'm working on my fitness)
Independent, athletic
I been sweating, doing calisthenics
Booty vicious, mind yo business
I been working, working on my fitness

[Intro]
Learning to love yourself and like learning to love your body is like a whole journey that I feel like every person, but more specifically, women, have to go through so I feel like doing this is a good way to kinda break through and kinda seal the last chapter of the "learning to love" and just loving..

[Verse 1]
Ooh, what's deeper than, what's deeper than the darkest best
Kept secret? Beneath the surface, we could
Let it bring us together, or it could tear us apart, oh
I'm filled with it, I gotta love with no conditions
Though it's hard to re-envision time and time again
Even when, even when it didn't matter anymore
The most beautiful thing that you ever seen
Is even bigger than what we think it means
Reflections in my bloodstreams, it's even bigger than

[Hook]
I woke up in this, I woke up in this
In my skin
I can't wash it away, so you can't take it from me
My brown skin

[Verse 2]
Real world, big girl meets world
A crazy position, now your dreams is your mission, huh?
Staring in the mirror, realizing, wish it worked
Now all I wish is for a chance to give my kids a Ford
I got a family tree that's worth praising the Lord
Mama looking like the second, whoo! Look at God
Sister like a soldier, hold it down
Southwest gon' hold it down, uh
I love you, don't forget it, you beautiful Black masterpiece!
Boy, they don't make brothers like you
Uh, make it happen with that Black girl magic
The hat trick off of what we must do

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Pardon me, just left a message to the city
Words stuck between my teeth, so gritty
Pay him for each minute I'm seething
A Black girl mixed with a little bit of Sacagawea
I pocket subpoenas, I swallow my pride and my ego
I wear my flaws on my sleeve and my skin like a peacoat
I see someone like me ashamed to be
And honestly, I'm really really
I'm fed up wit' it, try to send it up like a FedEx
I'm wondering what they sayin' next
Can't pretend to not hear it
It's your beauty, they can't have it
It's yours, they can't have it

[Interlude]
I'm done with the struggle. I wanna-I just wanna enjoy my life now and maybe appreciate my skin..

[Extended Hook]
I woke up in this, I woke up in this
In my skin
I can't wash it away, so you can't take it from me
My brown skin
Oh, I can't wash it away
No, you can't take it from me
My skin, your skin, yeah!
Oh, I can't wash it away
No, you can't take it from me
Ooh, my skin, ooh, my skin, yeah!

[Outro]
This is something I was born wit', you know? You can't buy this at a store, so hey..

[Intro]
I feel off

[Verse 1]
I feel off, I might love you, baby
I'd give my soul
You and I can't stand the feeling, I love it
The one you want, you can't fuck it up, yeah
No self-control (Self-control)
Weed it out and come get your girl
Oh yeah, yeah (Oh yeah)

[Pre-Chorus]
Call me, my long, long lost companion
Prove that my love is sometimes crazy (So crazy)
Hold my hand a whole lot closer, whole lot closer
Feel it, I know, I know, I know (I know)

[Chorus]
How deep is your love for me, baby?
Does it make your ass a donor?
How deep is your love for me, baby?
'Cause I know now a donor supposed 'ta

Move it down, I can't feel it, feel it, oh yeah yeah

You're wrong, you're right, you can't figure out
You're so defensive (So defensive)
Play at night like insomnia, oh yeah, yeah, yeah

Call me, my long, long lost companion
Prove that my love is sometimes crazy
Hold my hand a whole lot closer, whole lot closer

Feel it I know, I know, I know (I know)

[Bridge]
Cool up the wind now
Love will open the door
Cool up the wind now
Go and open that door
Love ain't a rodeo
I'll never rescue you
Love ain't no Romeo
Get what you're askin' for

[Chorus]
How deep is your love for me, baby?
Does it make your ass a donor?
How deep is your love for me, baby?
'Cause I know now a donor supposed 'ta

[Intro]
I try, I try to try, and see the love through human eyes
(Humanize me, baby)
I try, I try to try, and see the love through human eyes
(Humanize me, baby)
I try, I try to try, and see the love through human eyes
(Humanize me, baby)
I try, I try to try, and see the love through human eyes
(Humanize me, baby)

[Verse 1]
My hands are cold
My lips are tired, tryin' to blow (blow!)
To give them warmth
It's not enough, one heart alone
Cannot suffice
It simply can't, I've done the math
But in due time
There is no chance, for love

[Chorus]
I try to try (see the love through)
I try, to try

[Verse 2]
Your skin is warm
It keeps me up though I am tired
I'm tryin' to know
What else? Why else has this happened?
One man alone
Cannot suffice, I've done the research
Ignore the role
Inside my bed, your lion features (no!)
You can't lay on my shoulder
There are spikes and scales
And your cheek would just depress me
(In) a heavy haze, we love it
Love the taste of it, (you clench your jaw)
We love it, (you love it!)

[Bridge]
Humanize me, baby
Humanize me, baby
I try!

[Hook]
I try to try, I, I (see the love through)
I try to try, and see the love through human eyes
Who's gonna open the door?

[Break]
(By your side standing)
(I will be there by your side standing)

[Chorus]
I try, I try to try, and see the love through human eyes
I try, I try to try, and see the love through human eyes
I try, I try to try, and see the love through human eyes
(Humanize me, baby, ooh!)
I try, I try to try, and see the love through human eyes
(Humanize me, baby)

[Outro]
You smell so good
You're broke
Broken

[Verse 1]
LA carolin' with Carolyn
Caroline but I had to make it rhyme, I'm
Addicted to that weather like heroin
That is why I cannot give it any time, just say no!
It's too good to me, you are too good to me
O.D. on compliments, I need some oxygen
So I dip to the PNW, some of ya don't need where that is - good!
Need a little solitude with my crew
'Membering what's real is what makes you you, oh!
It's too good to me, know it's no good for me
I can't be out here homie, what it used to be
Sitting in bed like "man!", wishing
Itching for days with no end
Sound checks, checks in, audiences rapping
Getting full of that adrenaline, eat it up like Satan
You can't have it? Take it, you can't man up? K then
Breaking up my cadence, got that willpower like Jaden, blaow!

[Hook]
And we keep it going up
Make it go around, around, again
And we keep it going up
Going up
And we keep it going up
Make it go around, around, again
And we keep it going up
Going up

[Verse 2]
Flying into Paris with Sophia Eris
Had a heart-to-heart over fresh croissant
Wondering why these dudes be tripping
She like "Girl I'm past giving a damn!"
YOLO, guess that's why he want a photo
Dressed in Polo, arm around me after the show
But never there when I need hoes
Open mind but my heart closed, ah!
Where ya been? Back again, young man?
I remember you from way way when
You never gave it or reciprocated
But when I bounced for my sake, you peeped your mistake
"She left me" is always the excuse
I swear there should be support groups for men without Lizzo
Meet once a week and deal with y'all issues
Google me and jack off in a tissue

[Hook]
Yeah! You know what though?
We keep it going up
Make it go around, around, again
And we keep it going up
Going up
And we keep it going up
Make it go around, around, again
And we keep it going up
Going up

[Verse 3]
I will never be the person that you want me to
Feeling like I can't amount in what I'm 'sposed to do
But I'm here now, like how this happen?
Head in the pillows, I'm crunching on Cap'n
I'm chilling, I swear I been chilling
Taking a break, feeling hella breakable
I was taught that life has no regrets and no mistakes, no no
Bet I made some, granted
But my heart cold bruh, definitely definitely granite
Wrote this song halfway to Chicago
Wondering if I should call you
What, to make you feel special?
Would it give me reasons to forget you?
(Hey, you reached Lizzo. Leave me a message..)
I'm out of state, out of time
You more like out of sight, out of mind

[Hook]
Yeah! You know what though?
We keep it going up
Make it go around, around, again
And we keep it going up
Going up
And we keep it going up
Make it go around, around, again
And we keep it going up
Going up

[Verse 1]
Uh, uh, uh, I'm in the, I'm in the, I'm in the
I'm in the business of making music, that music business
The fitness, no one can witness cause I
I make that crack music (nigga!), uh
That real Black music (nigga!)
The only singles that I'm dropping are the ones
Flapping at the band of your white briefs
White boys please! Can barely believe
I walk by as they hold they skeets by the seams of they jeans
C.R.E.A.M. get the money, and run it to the hills y'all
Straight into my pocket, tired of the deals dog
Start my own label, keep the leaking sealed off
If you got a big mouth, then you might get peeled off
I'm the only fat-lipped bass, my flipper--vroom!--peel off
Eating flounder, Sebastian's like some bath salts
Munching on his bones, looking at him like "It's yo' fault!"
"Look at what you made me do! Yo, pass the hot sauce"

[Verse 2]
Looking at the back of Sophia Eris's head
Eating a sammich (but we don't got bread!)
Got a spider ass bite on my head, hangry
Feeling soupy, I brought my fuck in, yo I'm duckin'
Donald, Daffy, Howards, them cowards
Could never throw shots at a super with power
What was Russia without the czars?
What was Henry Ford without the cars?
My grandparents worked at Ford factory
So Henry is nothing without my family tree
And his slave-owning family needed Black blood still
So I think we need a spot up on Henry's will
That would never be the case, in case you ain't keeping up
I'm dishing out cases of that heavy bass
And them bassheads straight from the oppressor's loins
Are giving us our "Free us!" in hella coin

[Hook]
So bob your head crazy, bob your head crazy
Hip-hop, hip-hop turned crack from the era of crack babies
Bob your head crazy, bob your head crazy
Hip-hop, about to give oratories in stadiums and laboratories
Bob your head crazy, bob your head crazy
Hip-hop, hip-hop turned crack from the era of crack babies
Bob your head crazy, bob your head crazy
Hip-hop, about to give oratories--
(Big GRRRL, Small World!)

[Bridge]
It don't matter how deep yo' pockets go
They still get they fill, fingers scrape the bottom
It don't matter how deep yo' soul is
They sho' is blinded by the light
It don't matter how deep yo' pockets go
They still get they fill, fingers scrape the bottom
It don't matter how deep yo' soul is
They sho' is blinded by the light!
(Crazy!)

[Hook]
Bob your head crazy, bob your head crazy
Hip-hop, hip-hop turned crack from the era of crack babies
Bob your head crazy, bob your head crazy
Hip-hop, about to give oratories in stadiums and laboratories
Bob your head crazy, bob your head crazy
Hip-hop, hip-hop turned crack from the era of crack babies
Bob your head crazy, bob your head crazy
Hip-hop, about to give oratories in stadiums and laboratories

[Outro]
And ain't I a woman? Ain't I a woman? Ain't I a woman?!

[Hook]
Like my hands in the air
Fingers kiss the sky
Smile on my lips, and I don't know why
I think I'm in love, I think I'm in love
I think I'm in love
With myself
I'm in love with myself, I'm in love with myself
I'm in love with myself, I'm in love

[Verse 1]
Kissing on my mirror
Staring in my eyes
Appreciating every curve and crevice
Smack my thighs
Smack it twice, watch it jiggle
You a bad batch cookie, cream filling in the middle
I'm a very picky girl
And yes you can call me mama
I got an A in self-esteem
So save the drama for Obama
Presidential in my stature
Statuesque and big as hell
If you in love with what you do, then leave them thirsties by the well
If they talking bout you, let 'em
You they entertainment
Reading you yo rights, just make it rain what they arrangin'
It's raining, it's pouring
Men and they're boring
Hallelujah thanking Jesus he made men so they could please us
All these years been searching for something that would complete me
Who knew that it would be me

[Hook]
I think I'm in love, I think I'm in love
I think I'm in love

[Verse 2]
Okay, this verse is about my best friend, bad as she can be
The only one that's on her level happens to be me
She'll give you a sprinkle, to them flounders bottom feeding
But ween 'em
As quick as she get that peen in
Ditch like a queen can
Skzzrt, after dinner I like that dessert
But he thirsty like he in the desert
What's worse, give it to him or get my own
Think I'm bout to hit him with that scissor
Cut, print, this scene is done
Nice to know, you all so nice to know
Level son, you on level one
I'm like ding, ding, ding, elevation
All my beautiful, big black beauty girls
Brown paper bag, [?] coke can, chill pants
Light skin, curly hair
Afro, in the air
Love yourself like nobody else can

[Hook]
Like my hands in the air
Fingers kiss the sky
Smile on my lips, and I don't know why
I think I'm in love, I think I'm in love
I think I'm in love
With myself
I'm in love with myself, I'm in love with myself
I'm in love with myself, I'm in love

[Outro]
Oh my god
Bionik, Bionik
Iconic, Iconic

[Verse]
My ni-hick-a, momma hiccup
Got to pick up the whole damn check plus the tip 'cause
Bosses right off they dinner
You lookin like, I say what I am the breadwinner
You a crip bruh, just the tip, cuz
Got to go how you say 'bouts the dim sum
Heavy setter (boss), jet-setter (floss)
Oh you too hotel me but
You ain't in the Best Western
Balls to wall in your courtroom
Objectify and undress you
'Til you the last one in the darkroom
Exposure bitch, don't get sued
Big business say forever, that's a mighty long time
A wise woman once told me even [?]

[Refrain]
And you can't see me
Even if you have binoculars
You can't see me
Even if you had glasses
You can't read me
All these bitches in the coup
Looking like Stevie

Yup, 'bout to post my list on the wall
Of the school auditroium
Tacked up neatly
Sheets upon sheets upon sheets
For weeks upon weeks upon weeks
That these people cold feet
I've got a tissue for you boo-hoos
Hip-hop guys 'round singing the blues
I ain't talking bout the rapper
I'm talking bout the gift beneath the wrappers
Called a happily ever after
Fact is, it ain't too late
You still been making them hits
Since the seventh grade
Big business, say forever
That's a mighty long time
A wise woman once told me

And you can't see me
Even if you have binoculars
You can't see me
Even if you have glasses
You can't read me

Uh, Ima pop a cherry today
Alright, Ima pop a cherry today
Ima pop a cherry today, no
Ima pop a cherry today
You can't murder
Runnin out the game (get it)
Gettin locked up or
Gettin locked up
You know I used to get rich

Werk!
Werk like a Boss

[Verse 1]
Talk talk talk talk talk talk talk
That's what everybody and they mama wanna do
Whomp whomp whomp
Remote please, mute!
You can have your pennies and your two cent 'tude
(oh my God that's so messed up, how dare she say that in a song
Anti-fem, she's so wrong. I'm gonna post this on my blog)
Take a hike! Matter'o fact--jog
I've been running what took so long
I've been gunning for the top (boy stop!)
I've been reviving this thing, Ben Taub
If you took it upon yourself to take your self so literal
You're missing on the minerals to liberate your inner liberal
Generally i don't give a rat's patootie
But you pursued me
So here's my battle cry against those who slew me, who never knew me
(Big girl, small world)

[Hook]

Do I need to re-remind you that you sipping from the C-h-a-l-i-c-e
And I'm doing all this for the W-E?

[Bridge- Cliff Rhymes]
Getting dirt for the turf like a workaholic
But your worth cop a shirt 'cuz you work is na-na
Niggahs can't pay rent putting hustle in their mou-mou
Grasp for the raps for the stack when they can. Do
Slack, and I have to attack and offend you
Smashing these tracks...and that's what I'm into

[Verse 2]
Lookin like a girl cause I'm keeping it youthful
Such a freakin lady, classy and beautiful
Thinking like a man, for those who don't understand
Is having two grips to gain the upper hand
If you had the courage to give me reprimand to my face
Instead of slight of hand, you da Man!
(My employees no-i-me)

[Hook]

[Verse 1]
I stopped talking to my mama for three months
No eye contact during lunch
Wasn't nothing else around us but mountains and trees
And my guilty worthless screams, "What was wrong with me?"
Was the question, it was, it was "How could she?"
What happen to a daddy girl when daddy don't exist no more?
I guess we gon' see

[Hook 1]
Wishing I could call you
You know when that bell ring
Angels get they wings
Someone tell me we gon'
Be alright but I think
That I gotta be
One deep
One deep, one deep

[Bridge]
Dip my black body in gold (uniform)
I just wanna shed (ice cold)
Diamond crust (getting warm)

[Verse 2]
Somebody put me on the soap box
I got the voice of my kin folk, my mama
Mama gave me blessings and then some
I'm youngest of two, feeling like a elder
Alone in my room, wishing I could tell ya
"I love you", "I love too"
The best of me only comes out when it's you
But sorry ain't in my vocabulary

[Hook 2]
Man you better call me
You know when that bell ring
I will be on time
Someone told me if we
Listen to our hearts then
We gon' be alright (I'm ready)
Four deep
Four deep

[Outro]
When I melted into your chest
Just read this and think about it
Talk to me in person

[Intro]
Have you ever been to Paris at night?
Say something French
[On va voir Lionel Richie au Z'nith ensemble 'a va 'tre cool]

[Verse 1]
Right out the gate, I'm flowin' individually
You owe me your check
Respecting a pony, I swear to God like a helmet
Free as I move booze
I'm paid to amuse you's
Amazed at how soon we could get this far
Broke off of mix tapes
Still broke off that mix tape
But I promise y'all that it won't last as long
'Cause me and my girls, delinquents
We renting jewels and the trinkets
Trumps bumping something fan fare when we arrive like

[Chorus]
Hard rap, card trap, made for the mall rat
Blast this, in ear, make them witness
Don't bother me when I'm on the road
You on mama's back
Drops it, drops it on the floor
Don't bother me when I'm on the road
You on mama's back
Drops it, drops it on the floor

[Verse 2]
I feel like any minute decision
With precision, I pick off
Make my selection on who I choose to crew with
Girl, don't touch us
I know you want us to slip but
Slippin' is something we don't do
Tippin' for life, grippin' that ice
You thirsty to wife, uh
We playing y'all home like bassoons
We going straight up like balloons
We fresh outta that saloon
We steady making y'all goals droop
With that vidal, with that sasoon
You been lost, where you been at?

[Chorus]
Hard rap, card trap, made for the mall rat
Blast this, in ear, make them witness
Don't bother me when I'm on the road
You on mama's back
Drops it, drops it on the floor
Don't bother me when I'm on the road
You on mama's back
Drops it, drops it on the floor
(Oh my gosh)
(Don't bother me
Don't bother me)

[Bridge]
I beg you, don't bother me when I'm on the road
You on mama's back
He drops it on the floor
My side dude complains and keeps it on the low
He touch himself to magazines
To pictures of his own

D-d-don't bother me, bother me
D-d-don't bother me, bother me
Bother me, bother me
Bother me, bother me
Bother me, bother me
Bother me, bother me

[Outro]
Ego
Been showing lovers their own selves
Covered in [?]
Pride
Without natural affection
Truth ablaze
Where you been at?
Where you been at?
Bother me, bother me, bother me

I been drinkin' on the vodka orange juice
It got me thinkin' about thinking of you
I been drinkin' on the vodka orange juice
And you know I, know I, know I loved you
Think 'bout you
But I don't got time for livin' side the comforts
Of my God damn time so I leave it up to me
You been sendin' all these broken signals
I just keep him asking what we could have done
You tell me that I am too ambitious
But I break the moulds and you just watch the stones roll
Watch the stones roll
Watch the stones roll
You watch my stone roll away from you
It didn't even take three days
Didn't even take me there
Didn't even take me there

[Verse 1]
B-B-B-B, B-B-B-B, B-B-Big GRRRL
S-S-S-S, S-S-S-S, S-S-Small World
I be-be-be-be-be-be-be steppin' on my deities
Sweet like diabetes, if you want me, hide and seek
I be flossin' super hard on your bumpin' gums
Ominous, music be like (dum dum dum)
Lizzo never scared, bone crushin', you's a fuckin' ho
Vibrations spillin' from your head to your baby toe
Nigga, you's a baby fro, I be pick-ed out, soul glow
Actin' like you ain't been told
Summer's mine so please stay cold (brr-brr brr brr!)
Summer's mine so please stay cold
Dinner's mine, eat yo' waffles

[Hook] (x2)
Look like a girl, act (like a lady)
Think like a man but work like a boss
(Work like a boss, work-work like a boss)
(Work like a boss, work-work like a boss)

[Verse 2]
I need to remind you that you talkin' to The Chalice
I am woman, hear me rawr, Queen of the Wonderland, not Alice
And if you wanna get wit' it, house so little, you not rented
Take out that mortgage and spend it and you'll get zero percentage
(If I said it), I did it, if I did it, I meant it
Actions bring the pain like Dennis the Menace
Slingshot, David and Goliath on them boys
'Cept when this tree falls, yes, it will make a noise
(Timber! Boom!)
Testosterone in the room, I break it up with estrogen
I ain't tryna get chose, I'm already chosen

[Hook]

[Verse 1]
Time's up, I'm jumpin' in the side door
Beside you, disposition those whole mild
A child to a mountain makin' milestones
Gemstones ain't got nothin' on my shine yo
Abide though, the rules I make for potholes
Shut it, I done done it, son it, niggas
Jigga's favorite new artist he ain't heard of
Prince give me mad dubs
Tighter than Michael Jackson's glove, the left one
A-hee-hee, wanna fall in love with me-hee?
And she-hee jelly, you ain't ready for it
And when you ready, I'll get Freddy, we get Jason on it
You complacent homie, you a pencil, I'm erasin' homie
Better get big trick
And as I wrote that, my pen ran out of ink
Now look up irony and tell me what you really think

[Chorus]
Have you ever been to Paris, at night?
Neither have I
Neither have I
Neither have I
Neither have I
Have you ever been to Paris, at night?
Neither have I
Neither have I
Neither have I
Neither have I

[Verse 2]
Have you ever been to Paris? Me neither
And if you said you did then I pro'ly won't believe ya
Got a cousin named Litha, ya pro'ly never meet her
'Cause they live in Detroit and that city be lethal
Can't buy liquor on a Sunday, what is you sayin'?
But beyond that man, a nigga can't explain
But beyond you, I could finally see the sand
Excuse me while I give myself a freakin' tan
Kill 'em all like I'm the freakin' Son of Sam
It's like I'm a Muslim and you a piece of ham, yuck
I would never touch ya
Rather, you will never touch me, good luck though

[Verse 3]
Runnin' and runnin' until I can't go
I clicked the picture that's in y'all's pocket
Part and polly up in lane, partly and polly out makin' particles
Sparkle, that glitter ain't gold, that glitter ain't gold at all
She lyin', you lyin', go flyin', the strike of the iron, that's hot
Step back from pitter pat, get that from the tit for tat
Rat-ta-ta-tatouille, right up when I find you
We sat back, recline, sit to we

[Chorus]
Paris, at night?
Neither have I
Neither have I
Neither have I
Neither have I
Have you ever been to Paris, at night?
Neither have I
Neither have I
Neither have I
Neither have I

[Outro]
Oui, oui
(Paris)
Voulez-vous coucher avec moi?
I'm in Paris nigga I'm in Paris
In the highway, eatin' croissants and drinkin' tea bitch

[Verse 1]
Inspiration? Let me think about it
Violation? No doubt about it
Man on the run, man under fire
They 'bout burn him up, the drones have him surrounded
Click, click, click, boom, pound it
Click, click, hashtag, pound sign it
It's on your trending map, co-sign it
But when they come, please do not run
Just open your mouth unto Zion
Big bear, little human
A lot of salt, a little cumin
Add it to the pot, and light it up
Pow pow pow pow pow pow pow pow
Pow pow pow pow pow pow pow pow

[Chorus]
We do mean harm
And you, please disarm
Don't say a word
If you do, we're terrible
We come in twos and ruin you

Click, click, boom
Click, click, boom
Click, click, click, boom
Click, click, boom
Click, click, boom
Click, click, click, boom
Lizzie Borden, Lizzie Borden, Lizzie Borden, Lizzie Borden

[Verse 2]
Runnin' up under the system, wonderin' if you can miss him
Coverin' up with a black scarf
Tell me the difference, you can't tell
Washing all the brains, nasty with the fangs
Shooting all the shooters, got my looters in this thing, like
"We don't give no fucks"
Plus we got the antidote, blacker than a quarter note
Play niggas like a pentatonic scale, go to hell
You don't know me, but I know you very well
(Oh well, oh well, oh well)

[Bridge]
We
And you
Don't say a word
If you do, we're terrible
We come in twos and ruin you
We

Don't

[Chorus]
We do mean harm
And you, please disarm
Don't say a word
We do mean harm
And you, please disarm
Don't say a word
If you do, we're terrible
We come in twos and ruin you

[Outro]
I run nasty Liberace

[Intro]
Never cared for jingle bells or picking out a tree
I would rather paint my nails and watch some bad TV
But ever since we shared a kiss, I've been spreading the news
It never felt like Christmas 'til I spent it with you

[Verse 1]
Never cared for jingle bells or picking out a tree
I would rather paint my nails and watch some bad TV
But ever since we shared a kiss, I've been spreading the news
It never felt like Christmas

[Verse 2]
Sugar plums and candy canes, they did nothing for me
You could find me home alone and ordering Chinese
But now I save that old fruit cake 'cause there's enough for two
It never felt like Christmas 'til I spent it with
You, you, oh, you, you, you, you, you, you

[Verse 3]
The nutcracker was boring and the carolers off-key
I never saw a miracle on 50-something Street
But now I'm singing, bells are ringing, everything is new
I'm fa-la-la-la-la-ling into love with you, ooh ooh oh, you
All these years, I've been let down until you came around
It never felt like Christmas

[Verse 4]
January, February, April, March and May
Come and go when I'm alone, December felt the same
But when I see that red and green, now I don't feel so blue
It never felt like Christmas 'til I spent it with you
('Til I spent it with you, 'til I spent it with you)
'Til I spent it with you, baby ('Til I spent it with you)
It never felt like Christmas 'til I spent it with you

Aw yeah, ha-ha-ha

South west alief Texas not born but raised
I was kicking it in the west
But mostly down in the trae
Or maybe montrose for a picnic
Galleria boy I was getting it
Playing shows spreading my name
But it was so hot the summer's insane
At South by South West
I was put to the Johnny test
They wanted a freestyle battle
Ok, pants vs dress
One little line
And them boys was impressed
Ditched the southwest to Minneapolis

I pull up to the Minne and get buck wild
Moving it shaking it by the pound
West bank, wild n out
Trying to see what that's all about
First ave was recently
My niggas sold it out for a week
I step on the stage
The scene was serene
They ask my name
Said it was Queen

I don't what that means
But I know that its good
Nefertiti flow gives you Anuksun wood
Estrogen's in this testosterone heir

So I'm going to sit in my throne
And you can get in your chair
[repeat]


I'm from that south west alief texas
Boy we reckless
Diamonds in our teeth
Shining brighter than your necklace
Aw snap, I got it like that
Writing raps to the boom bap
Setting off a click track
Lyrical, spherical, psych
Just mobbin
And if you got that guap
You better watch it cause we rob you

Ben Taub you, life support
Straight As in life check my progress report
Address my court with piercing eyes
Your knees are shaking can't hold your thighs
I'm barely phased, hardly surprised
I've been the queen, you're just another guy
Marty McFly, boy you better think
I'm throwing everything at you like the kitchen sink

Yep, so you can sit in your chair x3
I going to sit in my throne and you can sit in your chair x3

I'm throning [till end]

[Verse 1]
It's that L to the I to the Z Z O
Ain't got no time for the C3P0, wookie
Never knock nookie, but I'd rather stack cookies
Looking at the sunset the color of Snookie
Woman of the year, huzzah huzzah huzzah, give her three cheers
Killin' everyone up in the coven, witch
Cuttin' all these niggas, better sew up, stitch
Will Smithin' these hoes, you know how it works
Punch a nigga out and say "Welcome to Earth"
I drop a mil, take off a scarf
Locs on my face like "I make this look good", ugh!
Capitalize your capital with a capital G
Giving out my secrets, man, ya'll better pay me
Sucky people marry suckers and they suck
Then they have sucky kids, they grow up, then what?
They attend all the sucky universities
And take our money like it grows on trees
Siphon to the authorities then get confused when we
Conglomerate to the inner cities
Perched on streets, being super sketchy
Skid marks on their knees, their hands in their pockets
They walking by real fast in case we got that rocket
BOOM! Slam the door to they apartment
That sucky wife is pregnant with another sucka ass kid
I'm askin' "When will it end?", waiting on that meteor shower
To rain down and bring all these suck niggas to they final hour

[Hook]
Don't tell us to slow it down, we won't listen
We're twenty-somethings and it's 20-something
Greenrooms, drugs and liquor and hip hop
We're twenty-somethings and it's 20-something

[Outro]
Rumors that world gon' end don't faze me
I'mma get faded, I'mma get faded

[Intro]
([?] Make it harder)
(It could all, it could all be so simple)
Disappear
Disappear
Disappear-appear-appear
(Gotta step yo game up)

[Verse 1]
What y'all want me to say, young man?
I am one woman
And my time is how you say expensive
I see they waste time on them expletives
I'm all verbs baby, let's go, you cute
I'm feeling sadistic, you will do
Another one if you got the juice
To pass around, it's for my crew
Yeah, he loving the crew
He wanna get booed, just do what it do
The turnover's too predictable
Can I tell the truth?
You might not make it so come get it babe

[Hook]
Looking like no other ho in here
Feeling like the realest
Can I peep the way he disappear?
Gotta step yo game up

[Verse 2]
What you know, what you know
What you know about falling in love with yourself?
Every day looking in the mirror
Think I found the proof for my health or my wealth
Yeah, laid up in this hotel
Sparkling bubbles and a pear
55 minutes till my sound check
Singing ain't the worse way they on a planet, jet
I'm taking all of my time, all of it
Body working hard, shower head
Sprinkling the stress away, tell em Lizzo wanna wait
But I'mma be looking real good when I get there, whoo!
Got a lot of problems, my niche ain't one
I slid right in, no swish, And1
I could have em if I want em, these boys is fun
Got em picking off the petals, baby one by one

[Hook]
Looking like no other ho in here
Feeling like the realest
Can I peep the way he disappear?
Gotta step yo game up

[Bridge]
([?] Make it harder)
(It could all, it could all be so simple)
Like you want me to go
[?] like you want me to go
Like you want me to stay, like you want me to go
[?]

[Hook]
Looking like no other ho in here
Feeling like the realest
Can I peep the way he disappear?
Gotta step yo game up

[Verse 1]
What you lookin' at? What you lookin' at?
Time go by pretty fast, you wear a pretty mask
You take it off for no one, oh, being you? That's no fun
You're being used for show, hun, if that's what you think so what?
You got a lot of friends, owe you a lot of favors
They bake you porky pies, they come in lots of flavors
Don't listen to the haters, you think that you have haters
Haters are just complainers, and you the first to complain

[Interlude]
Oh, it's you? Uh-huh, that's funny
That's real cool, it's me too
I tell 'em, preach!

[Verse 2]
Look up, don't let nobody pass you
These niggas is nuts like cashews
And they wanna be blessed like "ahhchoo"
But me not have time like Cogsworth
All in all for what it's worth
And the fact that I wrote this in a skirt
(Looks like you don't even need to try)
I'm burying y'all alive
Goes to show I'm leading in the hive
Queen bee, I want that honey
And you over here talking about money?
Hmmm, that's funny
You need to keep in mind

Sudafed, pop that, a hooligan, step back

Minuscule to me, I'm a big deal to you
I picketh thee off like a bug betwixth my shoe
Thou shall not kill, thou shall not steal
Spot lights or record deals, bus passes and happy meals
Nigga, what you know about it? Not much really
You holding out on dough or something? Not me silly
Niggas wanna help and niggas wanna take
Take a bit of this and put it on your plate
I owe you if you the right one
Luckily, I found the right one
Pass it down, I'll make it right son
Give me time, I promise it'll be worth it

[Verse 1: 21 Savage]
Every day that I'm alive, I'ma ride with the stick
I'd rather be broke in jail than be dead and rich
Told my brothers take my breath if I turn to a snitch
But I'm 21 4L, ain't no way I'ma switch

[Interlude]
Break it down, I break it down
I break it down, I break it down
I break it down, I break it down
I break it down, I break it down

[Verse 2: 21 Savage]
Penitentiary chances just to make a couple bucks
My heart so cold I could put it in my cup
Gang vs. the world, me and my dawg, it was us
Then you went and wrote a statement, and that really fucked me up
My brother lost his life and it turned me to a beast
My brother got life and it turned me to the streets
I been through the storm and it turned me to a G
But the other side was sunny, I get paid to rap on beats

[Chorus: 21 Savage]

[Interlude: J. Cole]
Break it on down, I break it on down
I break it on down, I break it on down
Yeah, I just came from the A
I drove back home, six-hour drive, six-and-a-half
Before I left I stopped by to see my nigga 21 in the studio
He had two of his kids with him right in the studio, that's when I knew
You a stand up nigga, I love seein' shit like that

[Verse 3: J. Cole]
Question
How many faking they streams? (A lot)
Getting they plays from machines? (A lot)
I can see behind the smoke and mirrors
Niggas ain't really big as they seem (Hmm)
I never say anything (Nah), everybody got they thing (True)
Some niggas make millions, other niggas make memes (Hmm)
I'm on a money routine
I don't want smoke, I want cream
I don't want no more comparisons
This is a marathon and I'm aware
I been playing it back from a lack of promotions
I never was one for the bragging and boasting
I guess I was hoping the music would speak for itself, but the people want everything else
Okay, no problem, I'll show up on everyone album
You know what the outcome will be
I'm batting a thousand
It's got to the point that these rappers don't even like rappin' with me
Fuck it 'cause my nigga 21 Savage just hit me
And told me he saved me a spot on a new record he got
He call it "a lot," I open my book and I jot
Pray for Tekashi, they want him to rot
I picture him inside a cell on a cot
'Flectin' on how he made it to the top
Wondering if it was worth it or not
I pray for Markelle 'cause they fucked up his shot
Just want you to know that you got it, my nigga
Though I never met you, I know that you special
And that the Lord blessed you, don't doubt it, my nigga
Dennis Smith, Jr., stay solid, my nigga
I'm on a tangent, not how I planned it
I had some fans that hopped and abandoned ship
When they thought that I wasn't gone pan out, I got a plan
They say that success is the greatest revenge, tell all your friends
Cole on a mission, cementin' the spot as the greatest that did it
Before it all ends, nigga

[Chorus: 21 Savage]
How much money you got? (A lot)
How many problems you got? (A lot)
How many people done doubted you? (A lot)
Left you out to rot? (A lot)
How many pray that you flop? (A lot)
How many lawyers you got? (A lot)
How many times you got shot? (A lot)
How many niggas you shot? (A lot)

And had an epiphany (21)
Keep the fame and keep the love
Just give me the loyalty (On God)

Money just stick with the boy

[Verse 1: 21 Savage]
Lot of model bitches check for me
Nigga, don't check for me 'less you got checks for me
I kept a stick like a hobo, no checkin' me
Way back when D-Lo had the spot in Trestletree
So many hoes, had to get a vasectomy
She left her body home and brought her neck to me
I did a walk-through, they sent a jet to me
Y'all niggas show price less than my travel fee
One of my arms worth a ticket
Watch so much that a car came with it
Back in the day I used to rob with no mask on
Shit on my wrist, I woulda killed the whole house for
And I went to school high, I ain't go to class though
I was with the OGs learnin' 'bout the glass bowl
Caught me with a deuce five, mama kicked my ass, bro
Break yourself, leave his brains on the dashboard
I'm with Ced and Lil Baby (Yeah)
We got four choppers that's full (21)
Way before rappin', on God, I was trappin', sneakin' my Glock in Lacura (On God)
I got my K from Osama Bin Laden, lil' nigga he signed this shit (Straight up)
I'm 4L gang, if you reach for my chain, then a nigga gon' die in this bitch (On God)
A-B-C-D-E-F-G Wagon, y'all niggas doin' that big cappin' (21)
I ain't with the friendly shit
Closest thing y'all gettin' to a handshake is the beat clappin' (21)
Your mama gon' have to make a GoFundMe, y'all niggas keep doing that sneak jabbin' (Straight up)
Gucci had to kill the whole woods
Just to make Young Savage this motherfuckin' mink jacket (21)

[Chorus: Gunna]
VVS look like a star, yeah

Popped a pill got my head in the cloud (Huh)
Say my name, it'll bring out a crowd (Crowd)
We got paid, now my family proud (On God)
I been drippin' this drip since a child

[Verse 3: Lil Baby]
I hit your bitch, she a jump off
Cartier bracelets for her, they don't come off
They get the swag from Atlanta and run off
I make the boys swing the stick like a tomahawk
Runnin' this shit, what the fuck is they talkin' 'bout?
Skinny jeans stuffed with them hundreds, they poke out
S65, I'm in a robot
I'm a real one, ain't running from nobody
Hellcat fast, you know that I show out
Ain't sparin' no bitch, give a fuck 'bout a blowout
If we wanna smoke with you, boy, you can't go out
Still gettin' money my label don't know 'bout
Court-side with the vibe with her toes out
Rich nigga, I come straight out the poor house
Trap goin' crazy right there by Morehouse
Dead end, me, Ced and more ahks
Bought a Benz, doubled back, bought a trap house
I'm with Savage in the 6 doin' donuts (Skrrt)
Youngins with me, they got fire, they gon' go nuts
Quarter-million in a baby blue Goyard
Buy it cash then I go in the motor
Drive fast, ain't no pullin' me over
Play with bags, you can tell by the odor
No alcohol, go get me a new soda

[Chorus: Gunna]
VVS look like a star, yeah
I took the top off the car
We don't abide by the law (No)
You don't know what I just saw (Saw)
Can't leave without it (I can't leave without it)
I keep a stick for the war (Stick)
Checks I deposit (Checks I deposit)
Money just stick with the boy

Slaughter Gang, pick your poison, dagger or the axe (Straight up)
Stand-up guy, they respect my mind (On God)
If you foul out, get a tech', my nine (Straight up)
If you ain't a hundred, don't text my line (Lil' bitch)
If you know you hatin', don't check my Live (Snitch)

[Chorus]
You know I'm Slaughter Gang so the smoke is immortal
Ain't nothin' changed, I'll slaughter your daughter
She said she was a dime, but her friend was a quarter
I had a threesome, then I flushed the rubber down the toilet
She tried to give me head, it was boring
Codeine got a nigga snoring
I wonder if she would've slept with the poor me
Savage keep a Draco and it corn beef

[Verse 2]
Chopper cut you up like Kitana (Ching-ching)
My chopper in the band, it's a drummer (Drumroll)
Russell Westbrook, I was strikin' like the Thunder (Woah, woah)
You was somewhere runnin' 'round whinin' to your mama (21)
Y'all play conservative, we gon' send a blitz (Straight up)
I'm the type to catch a tech', foul, hit him in his shit (On God)
He think he a made man, hit him in the head (Pussy)
Don't you try to run now, hit him in the leg (Rraow)
People wanna say the stuff I say, but they be scared (Pussy)
Jab turn a lightskin pretty boy red (21)
It's a fatality if you try to handle me (Yeah)
Real top shotta, don't you ever try to ramp with me (On God)
Got enough bullets that could kill your whole camp with me (Rrah)
I was bad as hell in school, they even tried to counsel me (21)
I don't like to talk, don't you try to tongue-wrestle me (On God)
And my block good, you'll never get the best of me (Straight up)

[Chorus]
You know I'm Slaughter Gang so the smoke is immortal
Ain't nothin' changed, I'll slaughter your daughter
She said she was a dime, but her friend was a quarter
I had a threesome, then I flushed the rubber down the toilet
She tried to give me head, it was boring
Codeine got a nigga snoring
I wonder if she would've slept with the poor me
Savage keep a Draco and it corn beef

[Verse 1]
Grind hard, nigga, grind hard, I done grind hard
Late nights playin' b-ball with a decoy
I was on the corner with the robbers and the d-boys
Now I'm on the charts, man, this shit is unbelievable
Mama, it's a lot of secrets that I had to keep from you
Got in so much trouble, thought the teachers had beef with you
And it paid off 'cause we livin' like the Greeks and Jews
Used to leave your stove runnin', stove runnin' (21, 21)
Now it's Louis rags when my nose runnin'
Got it out the mud, I don't owe nothin'
You pussy ass niggas, I ain't on nothin'
Wanna see me fucked up 'cause they poor hustlin'
The same niggas with me back when I was head itchin'
Man I'm having nightmares that the feds listenin'
You fake gangstas pump fakin' and they scared snitchin'
The coupe fast and it's fucking up the dash digits

[Chorus]
Numb the pain with the money, numb the pain with the money
Numb the pain with the money, numb the pain with the
Numb the pain with the money, numb the pain with the money
Numb the pain with the money, numb the pain with the
Numb the pain with the money, numb the pain with the money
Numb the pain with the money, numb the
Numb the pain with the money, numb the pain with the money
Numb the pain with the money, numb the pain with the

[Verse 2]
It's a bag on his head, I'ma pick it up
It was money in the house, I used to stick it up
Got your main bitch chillin', splashin', tryna lick it up
Dick ridin', niggas always tryna flick it up
I ain't tryna take no pictures, bitch I'm rollin' Swishers
I count my back end then I jump out with that pistol
If you ain't suckin' dick you get a early dismissal
We got your wifey at the spot, she tryna lick a pickle
I just went and bought a Lamb and it cost a nickel
And I came from the bottom and it feel good
And I went platinum, still in the hood
And I take the gang with me everywhere I go
Why these niggas hatin' on me? Man I don't know
Ain't a place in the world that I can't go
And I got a hundred racks inside a Go-Go
And I get a hundred racks for a show, show
Wanna give a bitch my heart but I can't though
I can't fall in love with a stank ho
Lil' bitch I fell in love with the bank ho
And you know I love that good drank, ho

[Chorus]
Numb the pain with the money, numb the pain with the money
Numb the pain with the money, numb the pain with the
Numb the pain with the money, numb the pain with the money

Numb the pain with the money, numb the
Numb the pain with the money, numb the pain with the money
Numb the pain with the money, numb the pain with the

[Verse 3]
Numb the pain with the money and I ride 'round with that Tommy
And I put it in her stomach and I made that lil' bitch ride me
You're my old school runner, you're my old school runner
But my new school runnin', it costs more than a hundred
You lil' niggas so bummy (21)
Make a diss song, they gon' wrap you like a mummy
My young niggas geekin' on boot like zombies
They hungry, up it on you then they tell you, "Run it"
I stole cars, drove them like go-karts (facts)
Niggas actin' like bitches, they got both parts (cat)
And I came from the gutter, I don't got no heart
And I'm straight up out the gutter, I don't got no heart
Nigga when they killed my brother, I had to go hard
Put that chopper in his face and then I Bogart
Niggas tryna cross me, I don't understand it
I'm just tryna take care of the family
And I'm sippin' Codeine, not Brandy (21)
And I'm sippin' Codeine, I'm an addict
You go to jail, can't depend on a bad bitch
She fucked and sucked him tryna keep up with the fashion
And I'm really, really rich and I ain't braggin'
Sometimes I really can't believe this shit happened
Who woulda thought I'd make it rappin'?
I almost lost my life when I was trappin'

[Chorus]
Numb the pain with the money, numb the pain with the money
Numb the pain with the money, numb the pain with the
Numb the pain with the money, numb the pain with the money
Numb the pain with the money, numb the pain with the
Numb the pain with the money, numb the pain with the money
Numb the pain with the money, numb the
Numb the pain with the money, numb the pain with the money
Numb the pain with the money, numb the pain with the

[Chorus: Post Malone]
I lost all my friends countin' bands in the Bentley coupe
Diamonds on me doin' handstands, Ros' on my tooth
If she wanna dance, let her dance for the money, ooh
I don't need no friends if you really wanna know the truth
I lost all my friends countin' bands in the Bentley coupe
Diamonds on me doin' handstands, Ros' on my tooth
If she wanna dance, let her dance for the money, ooh
I don't need no friends if you really wanna know the truth

[Verse 1: 21 Savage]
Lost a few friends chasin' hand money (On God)
Had the same friends when I was bummy (Straight up)

'Cause when the money come, niggas act funny (True)
Crocodile wristband, 21 Dundee
Yo' bitch skate so fast to the dick
That she'd even go and get a job at Sonic (On God)
Made it from the bottom, I'm a star (21)
Playin' with the stick like a guitar (21)
Why you got a 12 car garage? (Why?)

Who gon' be around when the fame and the cash gone?
I lost all my friends countin' bands in a Lambo truck

If she wanna dance, let her dance, watch her pick it up
I don't need no friends, what's a friend if it ain't no trust?

I lost all my friends countin' bands and I copped a Benz
Pulled up with no army, just the guap and I'm spendin' it
No, no, never lendin' it, that's all for me
I stay greedy with the dollar, givin' no 'pologies
All these mans with they fuckin' hands out, tryna spare some
I don't never stress, no, I got plenty peso
I been all alone, on my own in my new mansion
Everybody says I went ghost, jump in my Phantom
Paparazzi always tryna press up on me
Ever since I blew up, I don't know nobody (Know nobody)
Yeah, I blew 80 bands only for you to leave
Hey, I know somewhere that my mama prayin' for me (For me)

[Chorus: Post Malone]
I lost all my friends countin' bands in the Bentley coupe (For me)
Diamonds on me doin' handstands, Ros' on my tooth (For me)
If she wanna dance, let her dance for the money, ooh
I don't need no friends if you really wanna know the truth
I lost all my friends countin' bands in the Bentley coupe
Diamonds on me doin' handstands, Ros' on my tooth
If she wanna dance, let her dance for the money, ooh
I don't need no friends if you really wanna know the truth

[Verse 1]
Rags to riches, nigga came from the bottom
Hood rats, now a nigga fuckin' on models
Ridin' in the foreign, remember ridin' on MARTA
Grind got harder and my mind got smarter
I was gettin' bags for the cheap
When I ain't had money, I was robbin', nigga
I was gettin' bags for the free
21 Gang, they were right beside me
And they still with me, nigga, I'm on TV
Couple niggas switched up, bitched up, fuck 'em
I can't go nowhere without a pistol or a rubber
I'm too, too player to put a bitch before my brother
I'm too street smart, nigga, to serve a undercover
Niggas tryna clone a nigga's shit, damn, woah
Used to drive a hotbox, shit, Lambo
Niggas want a handout, shit, mine broke
I grinded for this shit, I grinded for this shit
Can't change on my gang, niggas still here
Kinda hard to change my ways 'cause the shit real
Niggas rappin' 'bout shit they ain't even lived
Niggas lyin', I can hear it in their ad-libs
I'm poppin' Percocets, bitch, not Advil
It's kinda fucked up what they did to Black, damn
If I catch him in the trap, I'ma whack him
I catch that boy in traffic, nigga, I'ma whack him
Nigga, try to keep up with this fashion
Makin' sure my kids happy
They dependent on their daddy
Tryin' not to let the streets distract me
I know it's bumps in the road like acne
Had to sell dope, I couldn't be an athlete
I'm a solid young nigga, you can ask C
The internet ain't gon' help you understand me

[Chorus]
I'm a street nigga, yeah I'm famous
I'm a rapper, nigga, and I'm gangbangin'
Everybody kill a nigga, what you claimin'?
Everybody get it with your nigga flamin'
All these chains on a nigga like I'm stranglin'
Ran off with your money, nigga, guess we straight then
You knockoff gangbangers ain't bangin'
In the hood everyday, I'm hangin'

[Verse 2]
And I come through when the gang need
And I wear shades so they can't see
And I pay them lawyers and the bond fees
Nigga one thousand, I'm beyond G
I put my main bitch inside Givenchy
Niggas still askin', "Can you front me?"
My old ho sayin', "Boy you growed up"
Promethazine, it got a nigga slowed up
Too solid, pussy niggas can't disclose us
Went and seen Eliantte, and he froze us
I'm too street to walk around with my nose up
Especially to the niggas knew me 'fore I blowed up
Savage Mode drop, now my price'll go up
Streets cold, nigga, they ain't showin' no love
Niggas get in front of judge and they fold up
Face shot, hit that boy with the whole dub

Told you before, know this deeper than rap
We been up-up in the cap, ain't no cap (Uh)
Just bought the block where they didn't want me at
Just threw a fest right across from the tracks
Tried take my world, but I got that bitch back
My heart in this 'til I heart attack
Runnin' this shit 'til cardiac
Not far from this shit where they find me at
Flame, Flame, La Flame
Walk in my closet, she tryin' on pieces
She wanna bling blaow for the evenin'
Up at the top it's still plottin' and schemin'
City of Angels, we watch for the demons
Out of the window, we countin' in seasons
Three nights in The Forum for the kids, gotta feed 'em
They open pits up without even speakin'
It's been some tension, but can't rock the wave
Let the coupe roller coast, get the fuck out my way (Yeah, yeah)
It will start makin' sense, I guess, when I get older
For now 'cause they cold, I got ice to get colder
I run through the H, keep an eighth when I go there
Don't break out Mo't 'cause I'm lit if I'm sober
Don't mean that I'm slippin' and slidin' on this
She wanna go out for the night, I'm with it
Yeah

Gotta beat the case, we gon' fuck your bae
We gon' beat her face
Walked out of Wells Fargo and ran to Chase
Hopped out a Bentley truck and jumped inside the Wraith
Young Savage, I was trappin' on the back street
All in traffic with that ratchet on the backseat
From the gutter, fake models don't attract me
Got a project bitch, she love to get nasty

[Chorus]
I been drinkin' syrup seein' demons
Gotta keep it on me, niggas schemin'
Right pocket full of dead people
I been hangin' with the dead people
I been hangin' with the dead people
I been hangin' with the dead people
All my pockets full of dead people
I done fell in love with dead people

[Verse 2]
Bitch you gettin' comfortable, I don't need you
You come around the gang, we might G you
She say don't nobody fuck her like we do
You know I share everything with my people
My jewelry twinkle twinkle
Doin' donuts in the foreign while it sprinkles
You keep callin', I'm ignoring, bitch I'm single
You keep callin', bitch I'm single like a pringle
You know I'm fly like G4
Bitch you riding in a Pinto
Bitch you know your nigga lame like the Winslows
I'm 21 but you know PDE my kinfolk

[Chorus]
I been drinkin' syrup seein' demons
Gotta keep it on me, niggas schemin'
Right pocket full of dead people
I been hangin' with the dead people
I been hangin' with the dead people
I been hangin' with the dead people
All my pockets full of dead people
I done fell in love with dead people

[Verse 1]
Scrape the corner, buy a Rover
Crack inside my grandma's sofa
Sunday, family coming over
Move the crack behind the toaster
Carry pistols with no holsters
Trying not to be a poster
You was listening to your coaches
I was listening to the vultures
And I slept with rats and roaches
That's why I don't smoke no roaches
Niggas tryna knock my focus
Wonder why I'm sippin' potion
We happy, dog but we ain't joking
Big bullets, we ain't poking
In that pussy, slow motion
Nigga, ain't none of my songs wrote

[Chorus]
I'm thinking to myself you ain't gang, nigga, fuck you
Feel like 2Pac, Thug Life, nigga, fuck you
If he had the password to your phone he wouldn't have cuffed you
Dog ass bitch, I knew I never should'a trust you

[Verse 2]
Hoe stab a nigga in the back like the streets do
Can't believe that you betrayed me, I used to sleep with you
Niggas quick to say they loyal to you, they be see-through
Gang, gang, screaming "fuck you," they want to eat you
My son got asthma, grandma having spasms
Fuck the chatter, he gon' tattle, put 'em on the platter
Snakes plotting on my downfall I can hear 'em rattle
(That fuck nigga gone flop man
21 ain't even no real nigga, fuck that nigga)
We sticking to the G code, nigga we ain't beefin' over freak ho's
I hit her on the D low, yeah she like my steelo
That nigga think that he a bully, do him like Craig did Deebo
30-round hangin' out the big Glock
Nigga, no six shots, shootin' 'til the clip stops
You a lil' kid and I'm a big dog
Nigga, when we pullin' up the sticks out
Too much money got 'em pissed off
Nigga, I'ma pull up at yo bitch house
Fuck a niggas bitch to get a kick out it
Nigga pop percs, 'gone get a kick out it
Drinking on syrup with my dick out
Glock-17 with the dick out

[Chorus]
I'm thinking to myself you ain't gang, nigga, fuck you
Feel like 2Pac, Thug Life, nigga, fuck you
If he had the password to your phone he wouldn't have cuffed you
Dog ass bitch, I knew I never should've trusted you

[Bridge]
Whatchu want, ho, I got whatchu want, ho
Whatchu want, ho, I got whatchu want, ho
Whatchu want, ho, I got whatchu want, ho
Whatchu want, ho, I got whatchu want, ho

[Verse 3]
All my tint presidential, like I'm Trump, dawg
Secret service shooters, leave 'em niggas slumped, dawg
Denzel, I get surgical with this pump, dawg
Busting down, breaking down, then I put it in a blunt, dawg
Made man stamped, I got "21" stamped
In my face, teetee and taytay in the same count
I was down, bad and now I'm shining like a lamp
You put a ring on her, she ain't nothing but a tramp
They kicked me outta middle school and sent me to the house
We 'bout that gunplay, nigga, motherfuck 'yo count
19, I bought a Cutlass, four 12's and an amp
Beating down Glenwood, nigga, feeling like a champ
Nigga, we ain't takin' no deals
Lil nigga we ain't snitchin', we ain't making no sound
Used to jump niggas, now we jumping in a crowd
Used to make my mama cry, but now I make her proud
I remember rainy days but now she like the sound

[Chorus]
I'm thinking to myself you ain't gang, nigga, fuck you
Feel like 2Pac, Thug Life, nigga, fuck you
If he had the password to your phone he wouldn't have cuffed you
Dog ass bitch, I knew I never should've trusted you

[Outro]
Hoe stab a nigga in the back like the streets do
Can't believe that you betrayed me, I used to sleep with you
Niggas quick to say they loyal to you, they be see-through
Gang, gang, screaming "Fuck you, they want to eat you"

I pulled up on her and panties just drop
Up 32 shots and you niggas gon' drop

High speed chasing, give a fuck bout the cops

Drowning in money, I'm swimmin'

Hit 'em all in the body, I just caught another body
Lord forgive me I'm sorry, I can't help it, I'm a street nigga
I had to get some money, I watched my momma struggle
I jumped off the porch, had to use my muscle

[Chorus]
Lord forgive me, lord forgive me, lord
They keep askin' why I got that sword in my face (Tayman)
Lord forgive me, lord forgive me, lord
I just beat another case
I just went and bought a Wraith
I just nutted on her face
Brand new rollie with the face
No face, no case

[Verse 2]
Lord forgive me for my sins, I was struggling tryna win
I had to lose a lot of friends, nigga tryna chase them m's
Cooking up crack its illegal, riding with a Desert Eagle
I'm a felon, that's illegal, main bitch, she illegal
Hunnid pounds of Cali reefer, Call of duty heat seeker
Pull up on ya in a Regal, window down nigga creeping
Nigga rapping? I'm preachin', nigga we are not equal
In the trenches, niggas beefing, I remember not sleeping
Hit the club and get to squeezing, shoot it up for no reason
I was living like a demon, I was living like a demon

[Interlude]
Now I lay me down to sleep, I pray the lord, my soul to keep
If I should die before I wake, I pray the lord my soul to take

[Chorus]
Lord forgive me, lord forgive me, lord
They keep askin' why I got that sword in my face (Tayman)
Lord forgive me, lord forgive me, lord

Brand new rollie with the face
No face, no case

[Verse: XXXTENTACION]
I'm in pain, wanna put ten shots in my brain
I've been trippin' 'bout some things, can't change
Suicidal, same time I'm tame
Picture this, in bed, get a phone call
Girl that you fucked with killed herself
That was this summer when nobody helped
And ever since then, man, I hate myself
Wanna fuckin' end it, pessimistic
All wanna see me with no pot to piss in
But niggas been excited 'bout the grave I'm diggin'
Havin' conversations 'bout my haste decisions
Fuckin' sickenin'; at the same time
Memories surface through the grapevine
'Bout my uncle playin' with a slip knot
Post-traumatic stress got me fucked up
Been fucked up since the couple months they had a nigga locked up

[Chorus: XXXTENTACION & Shiloh Dynasty]
I'll be feelin' pain, I'll be feelin' pain just to hold on
And I don't feel the same, I'm so numb
I'll be feelin' pain, I'll be feelin' pain just to hold on
And I don't feel the same, I'm so numb

I've dug two graves for us, my dear
Can't pretend that I was perfect, leavin' you in fear
Oh, man, what a world, the things I hear
If I could act on my revenge, then, oh, would I?
Some kill, some steal, some break your heart
And you thought that I would let it go and let you walk
Well broken hearts break bones, so break up fast
And I don't wanna let it go, so in my grave I'll rot
I've dug two graves for us, my dear
Can't pretend that I was perfect, leavin' you in fear
Oh, man, what a world, the things I hear

And you thought that I would let it go and let you walk
Broken hearts break bones, so break up fast
And I don't wanna let it go, so in my grave I'll rot

In my grave, I'll rot

It will all be over soon

[Verse]
And I'm always where the sun don't shine
The tears don't show, won't hurt me now
'Cause heart's been broke, I hate myself
But it won't show, I constantly lose all
My remorse, and it's ten for the wolf and
Three for the shepherd, and it's one for the sheep who
Led by your leopard, often gave his perception as a
Handle of weapon, took a bite of your apple, give me
All you can offer,  now I'm trapped in a changing maze
Setting my soul ablaze, couldn't control the pace
Where is this going? Hey, heartless is recklessness, it's
Word of a pacifist to word of a masochist, I'm
Off of the map, my Lord, I spoke to a Baphomet, he
Said he would save me if I gave him one thing he needed
"What is this thing?", I pleaded; boy, it's the key to even, yeah

[Outro]
And as I spoke, my fangs were shown
Taken aback, he smiles and tells me
"What you crave will soon be yours
But what I crave is already mine"
Anima vestra
Anima

[Verse: XXXTENTACION]
Trapped in a concept, falsely accused
Misused and misled
Bitch, I'm hopin' you fuckin' rest in peace
Now the fact that I'm alone is fuckin' comfortin'
And I can't seem to shake this fuckin' feeling in my'
Uh, cold shoulder, heartbroken, misspoken
I'm cut open, her fingers in all my stab wounds
And if she could, she'd probably dance on my grave
Inside my head, I see your face
I fuckin' hate that I love you still (Yeah)

[Chorus: XXXTENTACION]
Carry on, like flights, I just carry on
With this pain inside of my chest
Got no choice but to carry on, uh

You want me in your bed, 'cause I've been in your head

[Verse]
Baby, you've been up all night, so you don't wanna wait on me

You don't wanna, you don't wanna, you don't wanna
You don't wanna, you don't wanna

[Intro]
Luke White on the beat

[Verse]
You ever seen a nigga hung with a gold chain?
I'd rather sing about the same things that we claim
Such is bashful, but niggas like the task force
Mobbin' on the streets and robbin' stores in ski masks, bruh
Niggas ask for peace in a riot and bring violence
'Cause it's a game of cat and mouse and you gon' bleed silent
What's the justice in sayin', "Fuck it," and grab the pump?
Then kill a woman with many children makes you a chump
Look at all the stores you wreckin', nigga I reckon
Think about the people who own it for about a second
I know you got your problems, but brother, they got theirs
This is not a game, quit violence and grow a pair
But yo, you'd rather hear me say, "Fuck the black prejudice
Let's murder different races, grow hatred, and form irrelevant
Views" and etcetera, knives thrown
Damage 'em, lives blown, oblivion hole cold, oblivious
I won't dare say that you should stop the fuckin' ignorance
Murder ops, killin' shit, I'd enjoy the thrill of it
Bathe in blood of officers, different corpses, offin' 'em
Auction 'em, don't you bark at 'em
Murder 'em, never heard of 'em
I could preach the peace but say, "Fuck it," and preach the murder
'Cause this ain't fuckin' life that we livin'
Go ahead and grab the extension
Grab another one: uncle, cousin, brother, son
Glory to all the chosen ones that will rid you of the innocence
But in a sense, innocent will soon behold the ignorance
Blasphemous, killin' our own, murderin' black'

[Outro]
We see, I see, death before the children
White guys and white girls hanging from the buildings
We hate niggers!
We hate Jews!
We hate faggots!
And we hate spics!
Hooray!
We don't have to have a reason to hate them
Just because they breathe we hate their filthy bums!
You people need to get off your ass and wake up
This is America, the niggers are taking it over and the Jews
Make a stand, join the klan
White power! White power! White power!
And I hate Jews! I hate them because they exist!
I hate them because they breathe!
I hate them because they're scum!
The goddamn niggers are the scum of the Earth!
White power!

[Intro: XXXTENTACION & Nicole Dollanganger]
I shot an angel with my father's rifle
I should've set it free but I...
Our Father, hallowed be thy Name
I shot an angel with my father's rifle
Thy Kingdom come
I should've set it free but I...

[Verse 1: XXXTENTACION]
Hush little angel, don't say a word
Bottle full of pills, passed out on the curb
Sun brings heat and it just won't snow
Noose like a necklace on my neck, won't go
I was too slow 'cause I won't understand
Blade for your cries, count a penny for my sins
Water flies off and the lake don't stream
Wrist down the river, not across, wanna bleed

[Chorus: XXXTENTACION]
Grow your wings, fly away, fly away, fly away
You don't wanna stay, wanna stay, wanna stay
Grow your wings, fly away, fly away, fly away
You don't wanna stay, wanna stay, wanna stay

[Verse 2: XXXTENTACION]
Wake up to your face
I'm straight-forward, fuck a pace
What I wanted just so happened to be you
Couldn't picture being a moment in your shoes
When I think back to the kidney failures
Broken promise, I failed
I won't deny it, I hailed the ground you walk on
Yeah
Heart stops, you walk away
You're good today, you're gone tomorrow
I carry my heart on my face, I'm so depressed
What good is sex?
I pray that you would love me less
And now it's here, hand on my chest

[Chorus: XXXTENTACION]
Grow your wings, fly away, fly away, fly away
You don't wanna stay, wanna stay, wanna stay
Grow your wings, fly away, fly away, fly away
You don't wanna stay, wanna stay, wanna stay

[Verse]
The pain in my heart just won't end
The words that I find just don't seem to compare
Awaiting my death in the end
Alone, I must seek out the end to begin
So nobody wants death
'Cause nobody wants life to end
I'm the only one stressed
And the only one tired of having fake friends
Put the noose on my neck
And the hole in my back, again
I've been waiting on death with a smile on my face
So this is the end
Waste of tears
Waste of years and months
Faced my fears
Loving her for once
Hurt me
Break my heart
Worthless
Can't keep love at all
Turning, twist myself
Worthless
Can't keep love at all, at all

[Intro: Carlos Andrez]

Let me make you feel alri-i-i-i-ight (Eh)

[Verse 2: Rio Santana]
Got me caught up in the vibe, now mama let's go
I'ma make you shine in the night time (Baby)
Rolling with a star, you could be my angel
Just back that booty up at the right time
I can feel you when you dance, you grabbing all on my pants
I'm kissing you in advance, baby, live it up
She putting me in a trance, I'm throwing out all my bands
She yelling that this a jam, DJ, turn it up

[Bridge: Rio Santana]
She want it, she want it
We going hard 'til 6 in the morning
She need it, she need it
I bet the neighbors know my name when she moan it

[Pre-Chorus: Judah]
Mami, what you doing all alone in the club?
Baby, catch a vibe and pour up another cup
Girl, I wanna get you all alone out the club
Get up in my ride, I wanna show you love

Let me make you feel alri-i-i-i-ight
Girl, I'll have you feeling ri-i-i-i-ight
Maybe only for a ni-i-i-i-ight
Come with me and feel the vi-i-i-i-ibe
Know I wanna get insi-i-i-i-ide

[Verse 3: XXXTENTACION]
Hold it now, the way you spin around
Got me so aroused, I can't keep it down
Hold it now, the way you spin around
Got me so aroused, I can't keep it down

[Outro: Judah]
By-y-y-y-ye
Dance with me through the ni-i-i-i-ight
Back to mi casa, baby, sli-i-i-i-ide

Don't let me have to tell these niggas about the city I'm from
It's Brooklyn, be the home of the hardest ever (Yeah)
Where them niggas don't aim, they just palm Berettas (Bang)
And bomb whatever, say we don't move calmly, never (No)
This for my niggas trapped in cells like salmonella
Look, I could do this shit with no effort
No pressure, no gimmick shit, no radio records
Just textbook rhyme style with the raw texture
Punchlines, right hooks, now that's a trifecta
No more free lectures, I'm taxin' these niggas extra
This the Pro of all Eras, he's back in your sector
So, might be best to protect your neck
Or profess your debt to the god, he might bless ya

[Verse 2: XXXTENTACION]
Murder these flows like I murder these ho ass niggas
Where the fuck is your energy, bro?
Make your nigga deepthroat a Desert Eagle
If he try me like a ho, pussy boy, that's on my soul
Make my flow shapeshift, cold expression like a facelift
At the publix with like eight grips if you talkin' all that ape shit
I'm not talkin' YMBAPE shit, but I'm bangin' on my chest, bitch
Ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy
Travelin' through the infinity, uh

All that bullshit do not get to me, uh
I am a spirit, an entity, uh
You just wan suck up my energy, uh

You pussy ass niggas fuckin' suck, you sound the same
I spit the pain, that's why these young niggas feel the same
They know I bang, I'll pull a fuckin' pistol out the Range and act insane

[Verse 1]
I seem depressed, always being bothered, never less
Keeping me out of prison and putting me to the test
They ask me what is happiness, you write it on a check
Or you feel it on the sweat, when your dick is in the breast, huh

[Chorus: Laura Mvula & XXXTENTACION]
Uoy ereht yeh, uh, give me a sec, look
Nwo ruoy no er'uoy dna tuo og sthgil eht nehw
Uoy ereht yeh, okay, okay
Nwo ruoy no er'uoy dna tuo og sthgil eht nehw

[Verse 2]
If death is what it seems, why is it so vividly portrayed within my dreams?
The fear of understanding the Devil's running his horse
Hatred's not received, it's coming straight from the source
Remorse, as this time becomes a factor, minds full of greed, exposing your benefactors
Backwards, pace backwards, everyone is superficial
Only breaching the surface, surface upon the Earth
And flames engulf the Earth, and prized possessions, they incinerate
This is far beyond any director tried to demonstrate
See the record, here's the record, take the record, set it straight
Perplexed, only receive slumber when at Heaven's gates
And this is fairly simple for your breath, try and contemplate your conversates
Hesitate and navigate your inner traits
Back to a time where minds were just matter
If you stated opinions then bones would begin to shatter
It didn't matter back then cause there was no reacting, acting up
Chevy in black, Acura
Accurate facts put the black in fact
If you thought that you are free, you should disregard that
All facts

[Chorus: Laura Mvula & XXXTENTACION]
Nwo ruoy no er'uoy dna tuo og sthgil eht nehw
Uoy ereht yeh
Young X'ster, call me a young Dexter
Nwo ruoy no er'uoy dna tuo og sthgil eht nehw
Uoy ereht yeh
My hypothesis is-is, death ain't shit
Uoy ereht yeh
I'd rather die than be alive in this life
Nwo ruoy no er'uoy dna tuo og sthgil eht nehw
Honestly full of trife and strife
Nwo ruoy no er'uoy dna tuo og sthgil eht nehw
Uoy ereht yeh

[Verse: XXXTENTACION]
Listen close, what is this?
Is it heartbreak?
Is it truly what it feels like?
What it sound like?
What is truly at the essence?
Sharp teeth in the chest
Cancer all in the breast
Of the beaten and bruised
Feelin' like a pawn to the greed of these fools
But I never been a piece of the evil
In the womb of these fake fuck niggas
With they masks up, presume
I'll be telling, if I got a load, I swear I resume
On my conquest
For the key to the chest where my mind slept
And the love in my heart is a cancer
And I spread it through the wall as an answer
To the cries of the dead and the vanquished
The depressed and the lost and the damned, it's
Preservation of the peace, an ideal world
Never lonely when you flowin' through my mind, girl
I apologize, 'cause I couldn't see the pain in your damn eyes
'Cause a nigga made you leave with your heart in between different pains
Couldn't see ya when ya ain't cry

[Outro: XXXTENTACION]
I guess I'm at a loss for words
To feel so close to someone, and for them to be gone the next day
I guess you never realize how permanently damaging that is

Yah, yah

Found this sound in Sweden, a while ago
It's like, the more I explore this song, the more-
I explore different sounds, period
It's like the more I fall in love with making music
It's nice, actually

[Verse 2]
I'm out my mind, see fear in your eyes
I'm sick, I despise myself again
The tears never come, my body is numb
I feel like a god amongst the men
Cut out my eyes, feed me with lies
That I don't never have to see again
I feed the hate, I feed the truth
I give the pain to the youth
Fuck the devil for your wealth
Pistol chilling on my shelf

And I don't need no fucking help
Fuck the devil for your wealth

[Verse]
And hell is just a government creation
And all the information they solicit isn't nearly close to truth
It was clear since the alteration
Of the books our children study when they said Columbus discovered America, oh, the ultimatum
Of telling you the truth but oh well I'm already in hell
I'm tired of havin' patience
So I'ma sell my soul and say some shit that fuckin' bothers you
Jesus wasn't white nor black, I can't knock it
Was somewhat a Arab and one hell of a prophet
Don't understand why J. Cole talkin' 'bout false prophets
But didn't mention higher-ups
Change your name to Amber Cole
These fucking entertainers is playing it by the rules
Sucking government dick for safety to stay cool
I'm absolutely disgusted by all of you motherfuckers
Tie your throat to a truck, better pedal the metal quickly

[Chorus]
And every single year
I'm drowning in my tears, I'm drowning in my tears again
I can't seem to forget the pain you seem to give
The pain you seem to give, my friend
And every single year
I'm drowning in my tears, I'm drowning in my tears again
I can't seem to forget the pain you seem to give
The pain you seem to give, my friend

Woah, oh, woah, oh
Woah, oh, woah, oh
Woah, oh, woah, oh
Woah, oh, woah, oh
Woah, oh, woah, oh

And every single year
I'm drowning in my tears, I'm drowning in my tears again
I can't seem to forget the pain you seem to give
The pain you seem to give, my friend
Woah, oh
And every single year
I'm drowning in my tears, I'm drowning in my tears again
Woah, oh
I can't seem to forget the pain you seem to give
The pain you seem to give, my friend
Woah, oh, woah, oh, woah, oh

I'm drowning in my tears, I'm drowning in my tears again
I can't seem to forget the pain you seem to give
The pain you seem to give, my friend
Woah, oh

[Verse]
Dead inside
Spend a lot of time stuck in this head, of mine
Under the assumption love is dead, already
Just let me be here
Where was I?
When he was feeling on you with his hands, at night?
Seen the vivid pictures in my head, at night
It left me in tears
Where was I?
When he was feeling on you with his hands?
Seen the vivid pictures in my head
I'm under the assumption love is dead
Where was I?
When he was feeling on you with his hands?
I'm under the assumption love is dead
Seen the vivid pictures in my head

[Chorus]
I remember I had walked home that day
Content with all my misery
Told myself it'd get better, no clue what there was next for me
Remember there was people, walkin', talkin' in the distance
I was dressed for winter weather
But the summer rays were kissing me, I'
I was lost

[Verse 1]
So I took a different path
In the distance he awaited me
Had no weapon, I'm guessin' his hands were just enough for me
Was no question, I'm guessin' he laughed just at the sight of me
I was lost

[Chorus]
I remember I had walked home that day
Content with all my misery
Told myself it'd get better, no clue what there was next for me
Remember there was people, walkin', talkin' in the distance
I was dressed for winter weather
But the summer rays were kissing me, I'
I was lost

[Verse 2]
And there he was, his presence was alarming
As he approached, was casual, we talked 'bout self-harming
He told me, "Kid, you shouldn't be walkin' on your own"
He smiled and laughed, and pat my back
He asked, "How far are you from home?"
I said, "Maybe 30 minutes"
His frequency distorted quick, I seen it in his image
I should've run right fucking there, a'

[Instrumental Interlude]

[Verse 3]
You ever woke up on a train track, with no motherfuckin' clothes on?
Death before your eyes, you prayin' to God, but ain't no response
Tryna scream for hope, just a shoulder that you can lean on
But ain't nobody comin', so you scream on and scream on and scream on
While this evil fuck laugh at you
Train getting closer, you still surprised that he battered you
Tears falling harder and harder, minutes get minuscule
Could've had a son or a daughter, now what you finna do?
You finna die here on this train track
'Cause clearly after death, ain't no way you can find your way back
Thinking 'bout your previous memories, going way back
All them fucking dreams 'bout a diamond chain and a Maybach
Now your time finally up
Ask yourself this final question, is you going down or up?
Recollectin' all the moments that you never gave a fuck
Now it's here, death has now arrived, time's finally up

[Intro]
I can't seem to find someone's shoulder
Who will I rely on when it's over?
Took a chance with you, it made me colder
Better on my own when it's all over

[Verse]
So when I'm weak, who do I call?
My God, it hurts, I can't be calm
What do I do? Where do I run?
I'm tired of hate, I'm tired of love
I dug my nails into my arms
She turned and laughed at all my scars
What is my worth?
What is my worth?

[Outro]
Gave my love a piece of me
She put my heart beneath her feet
She turned and left I question, "What's my worth?"
Gave my love a piece of me
She put my heart beneath her feet
She turned and left I question, "What's my worth?"
My worth, my worth

[Intro]
As a fair warning to everyone listening to this song
I advise you to not hide your feelings
Don't pretend to be okay when you're not okay
Don't pretend to be happy when you're sad
It'll only lead to your misery

[Verse]
Don't you fucking hate it when you hear my name?
I feel the same and when you hear this you gon' feel the pain
And all these niggas that you fuckin' with to get away
But girl, I know you think about it almost every day
And I'll be honest, I be jealous of these niggas, true
How you feeling  with these niggas that you talk to?
Captivated by your mind and your walk, too
Can't replace you with these bitches that I talk to
This ain't lust, it's love, we had trust, what's good?
I should've held you close, should've kept you warm
And when the rain is fallin', wonder who you call
Don't pray to God, you'd rather cry than call
Don't jump, pretend it don't hurt, repent, I won't stomp
My feet in a rage, my nigga, I'm no chump
Need you and I crave you, hate you
Think I ripped the wings off of my fuckin' angel
Don't hurt me, damn

[Outro]
W.R.A.C
I'll forever be the, I'll forever be the elephant in the room
I'll always love you
I'm sorry (I'm sorry)

Bitch, I am up, bitch, I am up
Bitch, I am up, bitch, I am up

Actin' up, actin' tough, just might get you fist fucked
All that talk about runnin' up, still your boy, I'm runnin' up
My flow's acidic, I murder rap virgins with it
I'm swervin', flippin' the bird while I'm purgin' niggas
My words is bigger, matter of fact, my dick bigger
The bigger the figure, the more they probably fuck, niggas
I'll say it again
No, I don't wanna be friends with none of you fuckin' Aliens
I'm Predator, nigga, I batter you nigga, yo, matter of fact
I'm better than niggas, I'll battle you nigga, woo!

These niggas is blind, need braille, huh
Watch how I switch, watch how I switch
Nut on her, switch, watch how I- mm
Nigga, where the fuck is your energy? Cannot mimic your enemy
Play pawn defending me, I can palm you niggas
'Cause I warned you niggas, I never swung you niggas
I don't need no motherfuckers shoulders to lean on
Way I ditch her pussy, I treat it like ding dong
Harder than the Kim Possible theme song

[Interlude]
Yeah re- real quick

[Chorus]
Oh she ratchet, I might smash her

Made a list of my regrets

[Verse]
Leave me alone, I wanna go home
It's all in my head, I won't be upset if
Leave me alone, I wanna go home
It's all in my head, I won't be upset if
Heartbroken, misspoken, breaking anything I touch
I'm not in love, I won't let you control what I want

[Chorus]
Hate me, won't break me, I'm killing everyone I love
Hate me, won't break me, I'm killing everyone I love

[Verse 2: Chris Brown]
Lil' nigga, bigger than gorilla
'Cause I'm killin' every nigga that can try to be on my shit
Better cuff your chick if you with her, I can get her
And she accidentally slip and fall on my dick
Oops, I said, "On my dick"
I ain't really mean to say, "On my dick"
But since we're talking about my dick
All of you haters say hi to it
I'm done

[Interlude: Busta Rhymes]
Ayo, Breezy
Let me show you how to keep the dice rollin'
When you're doin' that thing over there, homie
(Ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy)
Let's go!

[Verse 3: Busta Rhymes]
'Cause I'm feelin' like I'm runnin'
And I'm feelin' like I gotta get away, get away, get away
Better know that I don't and I won't ever stop
'Cause you know I gotta win everyday-day (Go)
See, they really really wanna pop me (Blow)
Just know that you will never flop me (Oh)
And I know that I can be a little cocky (No)
You ain't never gonna stop me
Every time I come, a nigga gotta set it
Then I gotta go, and then I gotta get it (Woo)
Then I gotta blow, and then I gotta show that
Any little thing a nigga think that he be doin' (Ooh-ooh)
'Cause it doesn't matter, 'cause I'm gonna da-da-da-da (Damn)
Then I'm gonna murder everything and anything
A ba-da-boom, a ba-da-bing, I gotta do a lotta things
That make it clearer to a couple niggas
That I always win and then I gotta get it again and again and then again
And I be doin' it to death
And now I move a little foul, a nigga better call a ref
And everybody know my style and niggas know that I'm the best
When it come to doing this and I be bangin' on my chest
And I bang in the East and I'm bangin' in the West
And I come to give you more and I will never give you less
You will hear it in the street or you could read it in the press
Do you really wanna know what's next? (Let's go!)
See the way we on and then we all up in the race
And you know we gotta go, don't try to keep up with the pace
And we strugglin' and hustlin' and sendin' in and gettin'
And we always gotta do it, take it to another place
Gotta taste it, and I gotta grab it
And I gotta cut all through this traffic
Just to be at the top of the throne, better know I gotta have it (Have it)

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
Look at me now, look at me now (Oh)
I'm gettin' paper
Look at me now (Oh), look at me now (Yeah)
Fresher than a muh'fucka

[Verse 4: Lil Wayne]
Man, fuck these bitch-ass niggas, how y'all doin'?
I'm Lil Tunechi, I'm a nuisance
I go stupid, I go dumb like the Three Stooges
I don't eat sushi, I'm the shit, no, I'm pollution, no substitution
Got a bitch that play in movies in my jacuzzi, pussy juicy
I never gave a fuck about a hater
Got money on my radar, dressed like a skater
Got a big house, came with a elevator
You niggas ain't eatin', fuck it, tell a waiter
Marley said shoot 'em, and I said okay
If you wanted bullshit, then I'm like, "'Ol'!"
I don't care what you say, so don't even speak
Your girlfriend a freak like Cirque Du Soleil
That's word to my flag, and my flag red
I'm out of my head, bitch, I'm outta my mind
From the bottom I climb, you ain't hotter than mine
Nope, not on my time, and I'm not even tryin'
What's poppin', slime? Nothin', five
And if they trippin', fuck 'em, five
I ain't got no time to shuck and jive
These niggas as sweet as pumpkin pie
C'ROC and Sprite on a private flight
Bitch, I been tight since Guiding Light
And my pockets right, and my diamonds white
And my momma's nice, and my daddy's dead
You faggots scared 'cause I'm too wild
Been here for a while, I was like, "Fuck trial"
I puts it down, I'm so Young Money
If you got eyes, look at me now, bitch!

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
Look at me now, look at me now (Haha! Oh)
I'm gettin' paper
Look at me now (Haha! Oh), look at me now (Yeah)
I'm fresher than a muh'fucka

[Outro: Chris Brown]
Okay
Okay
Is that right?
I'm fresher than a muh'fucka!

[Intro: Che Ecru & Drake]
Before I die I'm tryna fuck you, baby
Hopefully we don't have no babies
I don't even wanna go back home
Hopefully, I don't leave you on your own

And your flex OD, and your sex OD
You got it, girl, you got it (Ayy)

Pretty lil' thing, you got a bag and now you wildin'
You just took it off the lot, no mileage
Way they hittin' you, the DM lookin' violent
Talkin' wild, you come around and now they silent
Flew the coop at 17, no guidance

[Chorus: Drake]
You got it, girl, you got it (Ayy)

Baby girl, you got it, girl, you got it, girl (Oh-oh)
You got it, girl, you got it, girl (Ooh)

You got it, girl, you got it (Oh, ooh, ayy)

You the only one I'm tryna make love to, pickin' and choosin'
They ain't really love you, runnin' games, usin'
All your stupid exes, they gon' call again
Tell 'em that a real nigga steppin' in
Don't let them niggas try you, test your patience
Tell 'em that it's over, ain't no debatin' (Uh)
All you need is me playin' on your playlist
You ain't gotta be frustrated

Sweet like Pearland, sweet like Peachtree (Like that)
I can tell you crazy, but shit kind of intrigue me (No, yeah, I like that)
(I don't wanna, I don't wanna)
Seen it on the 'gram, I'm tryna see that shit in 3D, mami
I know I get around 'cause I like to move freely
(I don't, I don't)
But you could lock it down, I could tell by how you treat me

I seen how you did homeboy, so please take it easy (No, yeah)
Good to have me on your side, I ain't sayin' that you need me (Yeah, yeah)
Six God talk but I ain't tryna get preachy (No, no, no)
I seen how you did homeboy, please take it easier on me
'Cause I don't wanna (No) play no games, play no games

[Verse 1]
I need your body in ways
That you don't understand, but I'm losing my patience
'Cause we've been going over and over again
Girl, I just wanna take you home and get right to it
Know I gotta kiss it, baby
Give it to me, lick it lick it inside and out
You know that I just wanna make love
Want you to scream and shout
And baby, when I'm deep in it now
I'ma slow it down, 'cause ain't no speed limit
When we're moving at the speed of sound
We gon' turn all the way up when the lights down
Why your pussy so damn good, miss lady?
Go and put that booty up, baby, one on one
You know I'ma go crazy when your legs in the air
You know your panties never getting in the way
You know I kinda like it, when you make me work for it

[Chorus]
Ayy you, gal, inna di tight up skirt
Get that ass in the bed, I'ma lock the door
Shake that ass like boom shakalacka, boom shakalacka (boom, boom)
We don't need nobody watching us (yikes!)
No eyes but your eyes
Ain't nobody here but you and me
Licking your private parts (Boom shakalacka, hahaha)
And I know you love your privacy

[Verse 2]
You don't need a shower, you already wet
Know that pussy power, telling me, I ain't ready yet
I say, "Fuck it," face my fears, baby
When I lick it, I put tears in it
Put my face in it, eat it like a dinner date
You know I love foreplay, 12 play, everything
Know my lovin' don't change
I don't really give a fuck what a hater say
'Cause you fine, baby
And it's alright 'cause you're all mine, baby, ooh, hoo
Girl, I'ma let you get crazy

[Chorus]
Ayy you, gal, inna di tight up skirt

And I know you love your privacy

[Verse 3]
Baby, I promise I won't tell nobody
Just long as you let me hit it like every night
I could give a fuck 'bout the club, 'cause that pussy tight
Do a split on it, drop it, baby, show you right
I'ma split your weave and you askin' me to stay the night
Whipped cream on your titties, then you suckin' on my dick with ice
Oh my God, oh my God, my bitch get me right
Ain't gotta pay for that pussy, my dick can change your life
I'm tired of missionary, wanna see you on your face
Put that ass up in the air, I'm lovin' how that pussy taste
Damn, on your side, on your side
Stop runnin' from this dick, I ain't 'bout to let you slide this time

[Chorus]
Ayy you, gal, inna di tight up skirt

You say all you need is consistent love
When I try, I swear it's never enough, I messed up
Maybe this thing here just ain't meant for us
Baby, you let go and I pull you back
I let go, you ain't havin' that

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Brown]
We do it like rock stars (Oh)
Sexin' in my hotel room and we so loud

One minute I hate you, then I love you

'Til we get it right we gon' fuck some more

Why is it all so complicated?
Baby, this should be simple, it's drivin' me mental
But when you back it up, it really drives me crazy
And you know what I'm into
Make me forget what we arguin' about, ayy

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Brown]
We do it like rock stars (Oh)
Sexin' in my hotel room and we so loud

Okay, thug prolly, yo, come polly

Or is it that you never ball? John Salley

[Verse 1: Chris Brown]
If you leave this time, I fear that you'll be gone for good, so
And I hold on like leaves in fall to what is left
Said her father left her young and he said he'll be back
With that same tone that you just said you'll stay forever with

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
Ooh
It seems that all the autumn leaves are falling
Ooh-ooh-ooh
I feel like you're the only reason for it
Ooh
All the things you do, all the things you do, all the things you do
Ooh-ooh-ooh
All the things you do, all the things you do, all the things you do
Ooh
It seems that you're the only reason for it

[Verse 2: Chris Brown]
I've been bleeding in your silence, I feel safer in your violence
I hold on like leaves in fall to what is left
Before I sleep I talk to God, he must be mad with me, it's karma
I'm confused who I'll spend my forever with, oh-oh-oh

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
Ooh
It seems that all the autumn leaves are falling
Ooh-ooh-ooh
I feel like you're the only reason for it
Ooh
All the things you do, all the things you do, all the things you do
Ooh-ooh-ooh
All the things you do, all the things you do, all the things you do

[Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar]
So the iceberg never broke
And I poked at it and I poked at it and I poked at it and I poked (And I poked)
And I poked at it but it stayed stagnant
Then I poked at it some more (Some more)
And in my notepad, man, I wrote (Man, I wrote)
If I don't have it, if I don't grab it
If it don't chip, then a toe tag is one last, I'ma hope (I'ma hope)
So iceberg don't float (Don't float)
If I do manage to do damage to you, dammit
It'll be grand as, ten Grammies on my granite, still standin' with a note (With a note)
That read, ''Granted, don't you panic''
When you make mistakes the most (The most)
One day, it'll make you grow (You grow)
When you outlandish and you lose manners, to God you shall consult (Consult)
When the bright cameras are still crammin' in your face and it provoke (Provoke)
You to act mannish, just stay planted 'cause you reapin' what you sowed
Keep (Keep) positivity in your heart and (And)
Keep a noose from 'round your throat and (And)
When you get mad and when you poke at it
When you poke it at just note, man
The iceberg is a reflection of you when you renew your vision
Just think if it had sunk Titanic, the fuck it would do to a critic, my nigga?
(Ooh-ooh)
Yeah, yeah
Tell me, when thugs cry, do you hear 'em, Lord?
(Ooh-ooh)
Do you hear 'em, Lord? Do you hear 'em?
And if my ship go down tell me who will abort?
And they won't let me live, even with remorse that I give
When they gon' rejoice and forgive, tell me how I stay positive
(Ooh-ooh)
When they never see good in me
Even though I got hood in me, don't mean he won't redeem me, Lord

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
It seems that all the autumn leaves are falling
Ooh-ooh-ooh
I feel like you're the only reason for it
Ooh
All the things you do, all the things you do, all the things you do
Ooh-ooh-ooh
All the things you do, all the things you do, all the things you do
Ooh

[Verse 1]
You ain't the girl that you used to be
You say you're done, you're moving on
This ain't the world that it used to be
Looks like you've won, looks like you've won
Sick of leaving messages on your cell
A true lover, but when I'm not there
Girl, you had somebody that really cared
How you fuck it up, girl, it's not fair

[Chorus]
You used to be the one to talk to on the side
Waiting for my love to break up
It's crazy how your ass can walk through every night
Acting like you been a player
That grass ain't greener on the other side
Oh, yeah
That grass ain't greener on the other side
Oh, yeah

[Verse 2]
Seems like ain't nothing cool about being real
No one's honest about what they feel
Take a hoe and try to treat her well
She'll be back up at the club again
I know what you want, but you're not gon' get it
'Less I know for sure that you're vibing with me
You do what you want with somebody else
I'm gone, baby

[Chorus]
You used to be the one to talk to on the side
Waiting for my love to break up
It's crazy how your ass can walk through every night
Acting like you been a player
That grass ain't greener on the other side, I've been there
Oh yeah, I've been there
That grass ain't greener on the other side
Oh yeah

[Verse 3]
My homie said I need to stop it
My momma said bitches be watchin' you
They gon' put their hand all in your pocket
For the credit card that's in your wallet
Drinkin' liquor when we celebratin'
Calculatin' all my funds
Tryna get a nigga take the condom off
'Cause she want that tax every month, woo
I know what you want, but you're not gon' get it
Take my kindness for weakness when you act sadity
Keeping it 100 ain't your fort'
You used to be

[Chorus]
You used to be the one to talk to on the side
Waiting for my love to break up
It's crazy how your ass can walk through every night
Acting like you been a player
That grass ain't greener on the other side
Oh yeah
That grass ain't greener on the other side
Oh yeah

Oh, hey

Bitches dancin' naked in my livin' room
She straight out of college, just turned 22
Girl, get your money up, I ain't even mad at you
Got you all on me, makin' these niggas catchin' attitudes
Tell 'em don't start it, my niggas retarded
Fuck the judge and the sentence, huh, I got a good lawyer

[Chorus: Chris Brown]

[Verse 2: Usher]
Yeah, I just got the ring, I think I deserve a toast
Shout out to my team, we be out there doin' the most
Girl, come to my place, but don't bring no clothes
Let's be dirty babe, baby, drop it low
Pop rubber bands all on her ass, baby been eating her wheaties
All in the back, dishin' the cash, make me if you need it
I got a few girls on the way, baby girl, you ain't leavin'
It's my birthday with the cake, lick it all, let me eat it

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
Pull up on your bitch, tell your man I'm sorry (Sorry)

[Verse 3: Gucci Mane]
It's party, party, party like a nigga just got out of jail
Flyin' in my 'rari like a bat that just flew outta hell
I'm from the east of ATL, but ballin' in the Cali hills
Lil mama booty boomin', that bitch movin' and she standin' still
I know these bitches choosin' me, but I got 80 on me still
I'm tryna fuck, who tryna chill? 'Cause I'm just tryna pay some bills
I'm multi millionare LaFlare, this watch here cost a quarter M
Just look at me and look at them, I smashed her on my first attempt
Like Scarface bitch, the world is mine, you should read the blimp
So either you gon' take a ride, or you gon' stay with him
'Cause I got places I can be, I get yo ass on the scene
Gucci, CB VIP, so fuck them niggas, look at me, Wop

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
Pull up on your bitch, tell your man I'm sorry (Sorry)
Hundred on my wrist, jumpin' out the 'rari (Jump, jump, jump, jump)

How to party, yeah, we know how to party
How to party, yeah, we know how to party
How to party, yeah, we know how to party

[Verse 1: Chris Brown, with Kevin McCall]
All that bullshit's for the birds
You ain't nothin' but a vulture-ure-ure-ure
Always hoping for the worst
Waiting for me to fuck up
You'll regret the day when I find another girl, yeah
That knows just what I need, she know just what I mean
When I tell her keep it drama free
(Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa)

[Chorus: Chris Brown & Kevin McCall]

You made me wanna say bye-bye (Say bye-bye)
Say bye-bye (Say bye-bye)

[Verse 2: Tyga & Chris Brown]
Uh, used to be Valentines, together all the time
Thought it was true love, but you know women lie
It's like I sent my love with a text two times
Call 'cause I care, but I ain't get no reply (No reply)
Tryna see eye to eye, but it's like we both blind
Fuck it, let's hit the club, I rarely sip but pour me some
'Cause when it's all said and done
I ain't gon' be the one that she can always run to
(Oh-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa)
I hate liars, fuck love, I'm tired of tryin'
My heart big, but it beat quiet
(Oh-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa)
I don't never feel like we vibin'
'Cause every time we alone, it's a awkward silence
(Oh-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa)
So leave your keys on the kitchen counter
And give me back that ruby ring with the big diamond
Shit, it's over, what you trippin' for?
I don't wanna have to let you go
But baby, I think it's better if I let you know

[Chorus: Chris Brown & Kevin McCall]
I'm on some new shit
I'm chuckin' my deuces up to her (Deuces)
I'm moving on to something better, better, better
No more tryna make it work, no (Deuces)

Say bye-bye (Say bye-bye, bye-bye)
Say bye-bye to her (Say bye-bye, oh-oh, deuces)
You made me wanna say bye-bye (Say bye-bye, bye-bye, bye-bye)
Say bye-bye (Say bye-bye)
Say bye-bye to her, yeah (Say bye-bye)

[Verse 3: Kevin McCall & Chris Brown]
Look, my shawty always on some bullshit like Chicago
So I flip that middle finger and the index finger follow
Deuces, we ain't got no future in tomorrow
I'm a dick, so it shouldn't be that hard to swallow
The other chick I'm with never complainin'
She make me wanna leave the one I'm with, Usher Raymond
Prolly didn't register, don't trip, later on it will
Shorty full of drama, like Gangsta Gri-zills
(Oh-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa)
I finally noticed it, it finally hit me
Like Tina did Ike in the limo, it finally hit me
(Oh-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa)
I got a new chick, and she ain't you
She Paula Patton thick. she give me d'j' vu
(Oh-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa)
And all that attitude, I don't care about it
But all that shit I do for her, you gon' hear about it
Breezy rep two up, two down
But I'm just puttin' two up, chuckin' up the deuce now (Oh!)

[Chorus: Chris Brown & Kevin McCall]
I'm on some new shit
I'm chuckin' my deuces up to her, oh-oh (Deuces)
I'm moving on to something better, better, better (Better, baby)
No more tryna make it work, hey (Deuces)
You made me wanna say bye-bye (Say bye-bye)

Say bye-bye to her (Say bye-bye, bye-bye, deuces)
You made me wanna say bye-bye (Say bye-bye)
Say bye-bye (Say bye-bye, say, say)
Say bye-bye to her (Say bye-bye), deuces

[Verse 1]
I thought we were great
You took your love back and ran us off track
I counted all the days
'Til you would come back, how stupid was that?

[Pre-Chorus]
Now you're missing what we used to have
Guess the vodka brought the feeling back
I was caught up in the aftermath
But now, if you really wanna know

[Chorus]
Ask how many nights I've been thinking of you, zero, zero
Gave a hundred percent but all I got from you, zero, zero
I thought you were the one, then you turned and run
Found somebody better, like I never met ya
Ask how many nights I've been thinking of you, zero, zero
(Zero, zero, zero, zero, zero, zero, zero, zero, zero, zero, zero)
That's how many fucks I give, oh

[Verse 2]
Wake up with a dime
Get up to no good, get up and you could
Go out, free our minds
Like you never would, never understood

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Now you're missing what we used to have
You been creeping 'round my Instagram
I was caught up in the aftermath
But now, if you really wanna know

[Chorus]
Ask how many nights I've been thinking of you, zero, zero
Gave a hundred percent but all I got from you, zero, zero
I thought you were the one, then you turned to run
Found somebody better, like I never met ya
Ask how many nights I've been thinking of you, zero, zero
(Zero, zero, zero, zero, zero, zero, zero, zero, zero, zero, zero)
That's how many fucks I give

[Bridge]
Broke back then but a nigga rich now
Got dollars, got euros, got yen, I got pounds, zeros, zeros
Calling me up cause your bad check bounced
My new chick one hundred, and she got her own dinero, zero
You think I'm thinking 'bout your ass?

[Chorus]
Ask how many nights I've been thinking of you, zero, zero
Gave a hundred percent but all I got from you, zero, zero
I thought you were the one, then you turned to run
Found somebody better, like I never met ya
Ask how many nights I've been thinking of you, zero, zero
(Zero, zero, zero, zero, zero, zero, zero, zero, zero, zero, zero)
That's how many fucks I give
(Zero, zero, zero, zero, zero, zero, zero, zero, zero, zero, zero)
That's how many fucks I give

[Intro: Aaliyah & Chris Brown]
I don't think they know the truth
A-A to the L-I-Y-A-H
Say it ain't so
I don't think they know, how could they know?
I don't think they know the truth
It's Breezy

They don't know about us, they don't know about it ('Bout it)
And as much as I messed up, always give me your best love

Sometimes I wonder what I did to deserve you
Yeah, yeah, yeah
They don't know about us, they don't know about it ('Bout it)

They gon' talk about it, gon' talk about it
Gon' try to change your mind about it

Just let 'em know we already got it
Just tell 'em that we gon' work at it, we good
D-D-Don't worry 'bout it

[Chorus: Aaliyah, Chris Brown & Both]
I don't think they know the truth, say it ain't so
I don't think they know, how could they know?
I don't think they know the truth, say it ain't so
I don't think they know, how could they know?

[Post-Chorus: Chris Brown & Aaliyah]
Don't listen to, how could they know?
What people say, how could they know?
They don't know about, how could they know?
'Bout you and me, how could they know?

[Verse 2: Chris Brown]
At my best you love me
Yeah, yeah, yeah
They don't know about us, they don't know about it ('Bout it)
Even or at my worst
Yeah, yeah, yeah
They don't know about us, they don't know about it ('Bout it)
And I know that it's different, feels like we're best friends, we connected

What did I do to deserve you?
Yeah, yeah, yeah
They don't know about us, they don't know about it ('Bout it)

[Chorus: Aaliyah, Chris Brown & Both]
I don't think they know the truth, say it ain't so
I don't think they know, how could they know? (I don't think they')
I don't think they know the truth (Say it ain't so), say it ain't so
I don't think they know (I don't think they'), how could they know?

[Post-Chorus: Chris Brown & Aaliyah]
Don't listen to, how could they know?
What people say, how could they know?
They don't know about, how could they know?
'Bout you and me, how could they know?

[Bridge: Aaliyah & Chris Brown]
How could they know?
They don't know about us, they don't know about it
How could they know?
Damn
How could they know? (Hahaha)
They don't know about us, they don't know about it
How could they know?

[Verse 3: Aaliyah & Chris Brown]
I thank you for the autographs and the cheers over the years
You stood by me, you didn't doubt me (Yeah)
I think you want some more (Oh)
I do more than sing
I model now, acting now (Ooh, yeah)
Plus I got my own movie now
After all the awards that they gave me, you stood by me
You didn't play me, you didn't doubt me
I think you want some more (Need some more, babe)
I truly believe that if it wasn't all for you
I don't know what I would do (Ooh, whoa)
Oh-whoa

[Chorus: Aaliyah, Chris Brown & Both]
I don't think they know the truth, say it ain't so
I don't think they know, how could they know?
I don't think they know the truth (They don't know), say it ain't so (They don't know)
I don't think they know, how could they know? (Yeah, yeah)

[Post-Chorus: Chris Brown & Aaliyah]

What people say (Ooh-ooh), how could they know?
They don't know about (They don't know about us, babe), how could they know?
'Bout you and me, how could they know?

[Verse 1: Chris Brown, with Ink]
If I'm out at the bar havin' a night on the town
Life of the party, pourin' shots of the brown
And you see me from the street but I don't turn around
Would you say, "Hi"? Would you keep going?
If I told your family that you didn't mean nothing
If you posted about it and I didn't even comment
If the songs weren't true, but you still feel something
Would you still come looking for me?

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Brown & Ink]
Oh, don't go reaching out
'Cause you can't have everything
Your head and your heart won't feel the same
Even if it feels like it every time

[Chorus: Chris Brown & Ink]
Don't check on me
If we're not together, then it's probably for a reason
Every heartbreak has its season
It ain't always summer in June

[Verse 2: Justin Bieber]
Might run across your mind but don't worry 'bout me, no
My heart is back in one piece, it ain't skipped a beat, no
Feeling rested up, I ain't missing sleep, no-oh
Don't take it personal if I can't reply now
I'm distant 'cause I don't wanna be reached now
Won't let the ghosts of our past weigh my future down
I'm liberated
Energy's like a circle, it comes back around
Reciprocated
Don't shed no more tears
Won't gain no empathy from me
In the upcoming years
Oh, I don't need your pity

[Chorus: Justin Bieber, with Chris Brown & Ink, Ink]
Don't check on me
Oh, don't check on me
If we're not together, then it's probably for a reason
Every heartbreak has its season
And it looks like winter for you

[Verse 3: Chris Brown, with Ink]
Ain't call you back 'cause I let it go
I had to focus energy and just let it flow
And when we ride low, we were already gone
It wouldn't mean anymore to me now
I know it hurts you so bad just to see me happy
That I finally moved on, and you thought it wouldn't happen
At times I used to cry when the world was laughing
But I act like I didn't notice

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Brown & Ink, Ink]
Oh, don't go reaching out
'Cause you can't have everything
You can't kill a flame with gasoline
Even if it feels like it every time
No matter how hard you try

[Chorus: Chris Brown, Ink & Justin Bieber]
Don't check on me
If we're not together, then it's probably for a reason
Every heartbreak has its season
It ain't always summer in June
Don't check on me
If we're not together, then it's probably for a reason
Every heartbreak has its season
It ain't always summer in June

[Verse 1: Chris Brown]
I don't wanna go there
We should never go there
Damn, why you wanna go there?
I guess I gotta go there

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Brown]
You're hearing rumors about me and you can't stomach the thought
Of someone touching my body when you're so close to my heart
I won't deny what they saying because most of it is true
But it was all before I fell for you, so please, babe

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
So please don't judge me and I won't judge you
'Cause it could get ugly before it gets beautiful
Please don't judge me and I won't judge you
And if you love me, then let it be beautiful

[Post-Chorus: Chris Brown]
(Oh)
Let it be beautifu-u-ul (Oh)
Let it be beautiful (Oh)
Let it be beautifu-u-ul (Oh)
Let it be beautiful

[Verse 2: Chris Brown]
Everything I say right now is gonna be used in another fight
And I've been through this so many times
Can we change the subject?
You gonna start asking me questions like
"Was she attractive? Was she an actress?"
Baby, the fact is

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Brown]
You're hearing rumors about me and saw some pictures online
Saying they got you so angry, making you wish you were blind
Before we start talking crazy, saying some things we'll regret
Can we just slow it down and press reset? (Damn)
You're beautiful, so baby

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
(So baby)
So please don't judge me and I won't judge you
'Cause it could get ugly before it gets beautiful
Please don't judge me and I won't judge you
And if you love me, then let it be beautiful

[Bridge: Chris Brown]
Just let the past, just be the past
And focused on things that are gonna make us laugh
Take me as I am (Take me as I am) and not who I was (Not who I was)
I'll promise I'll be the one that you can trust, so please

[Chorus: Chris Brown, with Sevyn Streeter]
So please don't judge me (Don't judge me)
And I won't judge you (And I won't 'cause)
'Cause it could get ugly before it gets beautiful
So please don't judge me and I won't judge you (No, I won't)
And if you love me (If you love me), then let it be beautiful, babe

[Post-Chorus: Chris Brown & Sevyn Streeter]
Let it be beautifu-u-ul (Oh, ooh)
Let it be beautiful (Let it)
Let it be, oh
Let it be beautiful, ayy
Let it be beautiful
Yeah, yeah, yeah

[Outro: Chris Brown, Sevyn Streeter & Both]
I don't wanna go there, baby (Be there)
We should never go there (Oh)

[Verse 1]
If you're only as good as the company you keep
Then I'ma blame you for what they say about me
(Free your mind and let your conscience be free)
When I was by myself, I was fast asleep
Since you came around, I've been up for weeks
(Free your mind and let your conscience be free)
Yi-Yi-Yikes, I've been with the wrong crowd
I can make you a believer
If I turn the nonsense down
I keep my secrets in a safehouse (A safehouse)
Better if I don't speak (Don't speak)
Devil's tryna tempt me
They just outline my shape out (My shape out)
Place me at the crime scene (Crime scene)
I can see from this high up
You ain't got a heart, girl (You ain't got a heart, girl)
Privacy is for the cheater

Why would I trip off that bullshit
When I'm on that good shit?

[Chorus]
I swear for God I'm moving on
(Mmm, back up)

[Verse 2]
Substitute love for a better thing
I deal with my pain like a lonely child, yeah, yeah

No, I don't say it often
And I probably should've told you I hurt this bad, I know
And I probably shouldn't want this so bad

Got me feelin' some type of way
Told you I hate you, I don't mean it
And the only thing that I got
Is the pain that you've been feedin'
Faded, faded, faded, all because of you
Now my current situation
Tryin' not to think of you, not to break the rules
Why this always happens when I get this way?
Just can't stop myself

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Brown & Jhen' Aiko]
So baby, tonight
I'm blowin' up your line
I got you on my mind
And the truth is hard to fight
So I'll be

[Chorus: Chris Brown & Jhen' Aiko]
I'll be drunk texting, drunk texting, drunk texting you
Drunk texting, drunk texting you
Yeah, baby, I'll be drunk texting, drunk texting, drunk texting you
Drunk texting, drunk texting you

[Post-Chorus: Chris Brown & Jhen' Aiko]
Drunk texting you
Drunk texting you
Drunk texting you
Drunk texting you

[Verse 2: Chris Brown & Jhen' Aiko]
I'm lookin' at my phone thinkin'
"Am I gonna hit send or nah?"
It's gonna be one of them mornings when I wake up and regret it
If I don't get no reply
I don't wanna make it obvious that I'm faded, faded, faded off a drink or two
And you know how it goes, this ain't nothin' new
Why's it always happen when I get this way?
No, I just can't stop myself

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Brown & Jhen' Aiko, Chris Brown]
So baby, tonight (Yeah)
I'm blowin' up your line (Oh yeah)
I got you on my mind
And the truth is hard to fight
So I'll be (I'll be)

[Chorus: Chris Brown & Jhen' Aiko, Chris Brown]
I'll be drunk texting, drunk texting, drunk texting you (Hey)

Yeah, baby, I'll be drunk texting, drunk texting, drunk texting you (Girl, I'm drunk textin')
Drunk texting, drunk texting you (Oh-oh)

[Bridge: Chris Brown, Jhen' Aiko & Both]
Intoxicated, intoxicated
That's when I think of you the most
But after the toast, anything goes
When I put my pride aside
I'll be doing the most, doing the most
I done spent 1, 2, 3 AM, thinkin' about you
Don't wanna be without you 'cause I'm on that liquid courage
I hope this shit is worth it 'cause if it ain't then it's all bad, all bad

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Brown & Jhen' Aiko, Chris Brown]
So baby, tonight
I'm blowin' up your line (I'm blowin' up your phone)
I got you on my mind (Whoa-oh)
And the truth is hard to fight (Yeah)
So I'll be (I'll be)

[Chorus: Chris Brown & Jhen' Aiko, Chris Brown]

Baby, come here and sit down, let's talk

I swear it'll only take a minute
You'll understand when I finish, yeah
And I don't wanna see you cry
But I don't wanna be the one to tell you a lie so

[Pre-Chorus]
How do you let it go when you, you just don't know
What's on the other side of the door when you're walking out? Talk about it
And everything I tried to remember to say just went out my head
So I'ma do the best I can to get you to understand 'cause I know

[Chorus]
There's never a right time to say goodbye (Yeah)
But I gotta make the first move
'Cause if I don't you gonna start hating me
'Cause I really don't feel the way I once felt about you
Girl, it's not you, it's me, I
Kinda gotta figure out what I need, oh
There's never a right time to say goodbye
But we know that we gotta go our separate ways
And I know it's hard but I gotta do it and it's killing me
'Cause there's never a right time, right time to say goodbye

[Verse 2]
Girl, I know your heart is breaking
And a thousand times I found myself asking, "Why? Why?"
Why am I taking so long to say this?
But trust me, girl, I never
Meant to crush your world and I never
Thought I would see the day we grew apart
And I wanna know

[Pre-Chorus]
How do you let it go when you, you just don't know
What's on the other side of the door when you're walking out? Talk about it
Girl, I hope you understand what I'm tryna say, we just can't go on
Pretending that we get along, girl, how you not gon' see it? (Oh, oh, yeah)

[Chorus]
There's never a right time to say goodbye
But I gotta make the first move
'Cause if I don't you gonna start hating me

Kinda gotta figure out what I need, oh
There's never a right time to say goodbye

Oh girl, I love the way you sound when you rain on me
So tonight let's act it out, and show you how it's gon' be
I'm gon' kiss your other set of lips
Hold your body by your legs and hips
The world can't end until we're finished
Girl, we gon'

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
And we gon' do it like it's 'bout to be the end of the world
And they depending on us
To make Earth-shaking love
As we lay down, lay down
Telling me to go harder, go harder
You're telling me to go deeper, go deeper
I feel your knees getting weaker and weaker
We can go longer if you just lay down, lay down, down

[Verse 2: Chris Brown]
All these vibrations from your legs, massaging my back
I got your body shivering 'cause we're covered in sweat
And girl, I like the way it opens up when you throw it back, baby
Girl, it might be too much, oh baby, if you keep doing that
I got that pillow for your knees right here
Baby, can you make it disappear?
Your voice is the last thing I'm gonna hear
Then I wanna make you holler

[Chorus: Chris Brown & Jhen' Aiko]
We gon' do it like it's 'bout to be the end of the world
And they depending on us
To make Earth-shaking love

Do it like we only got one (Got one)
Baby, let's pretend we only got one night
One last time, let me take my time
And do it to you right
Buildings and bridges may be falling down
But that won't stop me from turning that thing around, girl, yeah
Won't you come on over
And we can treat it like it's the motherfuckin'

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
End of the world? (Woo!)
And they depending on us (And they depending on us to make it)
To make Earth-shaking love
As we lay down, lay down (We can, we can)
Telling me to go harder, go harder
(A nigga goin' hard in the paint, you think I can't)
You're telling me to go deeper, go deeper
(A nigga so deep, underwater, can you feel my submarine?)
I feel your knees getting weaker and weaker
(Use my hands, and baby, you gon' get this rain)
We can go longer if you just lay down (Lay down), lay down, down (Lay down)

[Outro: Chris Brown]
A nigga goin' hard in the paint, you think I can't?
Watch a nigga go hard in the paint, you think I can't?
(Lay, lay, lay down)
Goin' for miles, no stops
(So good, lay down)
A nigga goin' hard in the paint (Right now)
Watch a nigga go hard in the paint (Just take that)
Watch a nigga go hard in the paint, you think I can't? (Get it, get it)
Watch a nigga go hard in the paint, you think I can't? (Get it, get it)
Watch a nigga go hard in the paint (Get it, lay down)

[Intro]
Ooh woah

[Verse 1]
Tired of the conversations, questions 'bout me
Every time I leave the house, when I'm in or when I'm out
Girlfriend say I treat you foul but I don't know
At the end of the day, you know yourself
And I'm tired of the times when you run your mouth
Time's only running out, baby, you made me take a vow
Stop your whining, and sum it up, what are we now?
At the end of the day, you know yourself
Can't hear when you're talking loud
Oh, you do the most, this shit's getting old, we both said enough
Went through this more than once, but my GPS broke
Don't know where to go

[Chorus]
Every time I'm lost and found
Yeah, this is not the lost and found
Whose time are you wasting now?
'Cause every time I'm lost and found, yeah
Oh, tell me who's losing out
'Cause you say it's the end and playing games again, I found (I found)
Playing games again, I found, yeah
Playing games again, I found yeah

[Verse 2]
Baby, you were the one that I could trust the most, used to think you were beautiful
'Til you would drink too many toasts, what would your mama say if
Girl, you're drunk out your mind, oh my God, get to praying
Taking bread with the wine, rude awakening
Lord don't save her, she think she a big girl
Think she gon' draft all the players, think she gon' be ballin' yeah
But no, no, no, no, I done worked too hard for these cars and this cash no, no, no, no
Selling your soul, might as well be selling your ass, no, no, no, stop kidding, girl, you know yourself

[Chorus]
Every time I'm lost and found
Yeah, this is not the lost and found
Whose time are you wasting now?
'Cause every time I'm lost and found, yeah
Oh, tell me who's losing out
'Cause you say it's the end and playing games again, I found

[Verse 3]
I don't know why you keep fuckin' with niggas
That really don't be in the streets
Always actin' hard like they murderers
Tell them niggas just run into me
This ain't the lost and found, girl, you're out of bounds
It take a lot of money to make her booty bounce
If you takin' shots, better make it count
And girl, don't do nothing for free
I see that shawty want that money bad
She fuckin' all over the internet
Dollars, where the money at?
Fuck around and run it up for a sack
Stealin' weed up out my duffle bag
Only the, birds, take the whole bag
Baby girl, don't try and go there
You already know that

[Chorus]
Every time I'm lost and found, yeah (oh, oh, oh, every time)
This is not the lost and found (yeah)
Whose time are you wasting now? (Whose time are you wasting now?)
'Cause every time I'm lost and found ('cause every time I'm lost and found)
Oh, up and down, back and fourth, all around
Oh, tell me who's really losing out, yeah (tell me who's really losing out)
'Cause you say it's the end and playing games again, I found

Oh, I need a jumpstart, when you call me, I'm running to ya
Gimme a headstart, thank God, gonna have me like hallelujah
Even though I'm a man girl, you making me feel like a baby
Oh girl when you lay in my arms, I'll take advantage of the moment
Girl the way you make me smile is the definition of a real lady

[Pre-Chorus]
So before I go to work, can I ask you for a favor?

[Chorus]
Wake me up before you go, ooh I need a little more

[Verse 2]
Oh I need a back talk, girl I'm your daddy, no sass talk
Oh baby girl you inspire me, give me the reason to keep on
My baby, my Royalty, girl you're the lyrics to my song
Girl you got this heart lock on me, I don't think I can control it
I hold on with all my might while you look at me in my eye
Like a vitamin you put back my energy, you're making me stronger, and bring out the best of me

[Pre-Chorus]
So before I go to work, can I ask you a favor?

Wake me up before you go, ooh I need a little more

Never sober, smokin' 'til I got concussions, no discussion
Man, I got a condo and got a big crib
Pounds all over my kitchenettes
If I ain't on the road gettin' it
Then I'm in the hood where my niggas live

They wanna see a nigga shot or see me in the system
All you niggas out here poison like snake venom
Codeine in my liver, rockin' Balenciaga denim
I'm booted even when I'm sober, I don't need a jigga
They sendin' all my niggas on a fuckin' journey
I told that baby to come over 'cause I'm fuckin' horny
My mama told me, "Kill these niggas, son, keep it goin'!"
I'm thug to the bone, but I'm still her baby boy
Lil' Kodak, boy, they hate to see you in a foreign
They miss when you was in that 'Yota kickin' doors

I can't even roll in peace (Why?)
Everybody notice me (Yeah)
I can't even go to sleep (Why?)
I'm rolling on a bean (Yeah)
They tried to give me eight
Got on my knees like, "Jesus, please"
He don't even believe in Jesus
Why you got a Jesus piece?
If you wanna leave, just leave, but you ain't gotta lie to me
Even the blind can see (Fuck)
That you ain't gon' ride for me
You ain't even showing me the love you say you got me for me
There ain't no loyalty, you lied to me
You say that you gon' ride for me, ayy

[Verse 2: Kodak Black]
In a Hellcat 'cause I'm a hell-raiser
Self-made, I don't owe a nigga nann favor
When you get that money, nigga, keep your heart
I'm slidin' in a coupe, ain't got no key to start
I got the fire on me in BET Awards
When your well run dry, you know you need me for it
When I pull up in the Buick, you know what I'm doin'
If the police get behind me, I'm fleein' and eludin'
Sleepin' on the palette turned me to a savage
I'm a project baby, now I stay in Calabasas
Like I still serve fiends, like I'm still jackin'
I be sippin' on lean, tryna keep balance
Hit that Z-Walk, Dickie's with my Reeboks
I don't say much, I just let the heat talk
Your jewelry water whip, diamonds like re-rock
My lil' baby ride the dick like a seesaw
When I stepped up on the scene, I was on a bean
When I jumped up out the Beam', I was in Celine
Baby girl, you just a fling, that ain't what I mean
Money bustin' out my jeans like I do the scheme

[Refrain: Kodak Black]
Pull up in a Demon, on God (On God)

Girl, we done, it's through (Girl, we done)

Stick and move and then I skrt, skrt, skrt, skrt, skrt (Ooh, I'm gone)
What is up with you? (What is up with you?)
I thought I said I'm done with you (I thought I said it's over)
Fuck my school and fuck my teacher, too (I will fuck you over)
Sniper on the roof, he playin' peek-a-boo, skrt, skrt

Jump in that jag, skrt, skrt, skrt

Skrt, skrt, skrt (Skrt) Ah, ah, skrt, skrt

[Verse]
When I say I keep the poker, I ain't talkin' 'bout no beans
Project baby, you know I got baby bottles full of lean
I've been through so much of shit this shit'll make a nigga sing
I remember rockin' Bugle Boy, now rock designer jeans
God dang, you just like my chain, you just like to swing
It 1k, I got 22k and all my niggas bling
Hit the club on them jiggas, you know all my niggas geeked
You'd think I'm 'bout to smack yo bitch, I made her hit her knees
Met this plug, I was talkin' 'bout he put that thing on me
I finessed him, ain't got time to let you run no game on me
Like I'm workin' out, life done dropped a lot of weight on me
I've been busy, I've been workin' hard so don't you hate on me
You my dawg then just be my dawg and don't you change on me
Don't you switch, don't you change on me, switch lanes on me
I was in that jag, now I'm pullin' up in that Range on me
I ain't in no gang, but if you run up, I'm gon' bang homie
(Kodak let it spray)

[Chorus]
Girl, I'm done with you (With you)
Girl, we done, it's through (Girl, we done)

[Chorus]
Look, every time you see me I'm surrounded by them snipers
You ain't never run off with a hustler in your life, huh?
I'm from 1800, I'm a hot boy, but I'm iced up
Ugly corner where we smile with you and we don't like you
Just hopped off the plane, I just got out about a day ago
Everybody love me, when they see me they be like, "There he go!"
Got me a new lady, we 'bout to take a trip to Mexico
Crackas took my .40 so I'm 'bout to go buy a Draco

[Verse 1]
Ayy, Lil Kodak on the beat I got that bass, hoe
Ayy, boy, I drop that shit that they be waitin' for
I like the Bimmer but I'm 'bout to go cop a Wraith tho'
I done peeped your true colors, boy, you a rainbow
I got Space Jams on my feet, I'm on the moon
I'm really lit, so I ain't gotta use no auto-tune
Yeah, I'm the shit, but you know damn well I ain't number two
I'm in this bih' around some niggas who ain't got nothin' to lose
But shawty got that head, she got that fire brain
She know I love the head, I love that migraine
You ain't never run off with a boss ain't ya?
She know a nigga be stuntin' like a Power Ranger

[Chorus]
Every time you see me I'm surrounded by them snipers
You ain't never run off with a hustler in your life, huh?
I'm from 1800, I'm a hot boy, but I'm iced up
Ugly corner where we smile with you and we don't like you
Just hopped off the plane, I just got out about a day ago
Everybody love me, when they see me they be like, "There he go!"
Got me a new lady, we 'bout to take a trip to Mexico
Crackas took my .40 so I'm 'bout to go buy a Draco

[Verse 2]
These ain't Ray-Bans, these Saint Laurent shades, ho
The way my niggas hit your block, you'd think it's Halo
No more home invadin' now, I'm on the radio
I don't even like to fuck, I only want fellatio
I done jumped out to that bag, baby, check my swag
Money fallin' out my ass, I got a lot of cash
Ayy, everybody runnin', nigga got a gun
I ain't makin' beats but the Draco got a drum
I don't wear no fuckin' Yeezys, I got too much sauce
Like I don't believe in Jesus, how I triple cross
I ain't even brush my teeth, but I'm on the block
I ain't even brush my teeth, all I do is floss

[Chorus]
Every time you see me I'm surrounded by them snipers
You ain't never run off with a hustler in your life, huh?
I'm from 1800, I'm a hot boy, but I'm iced up
Ugly corner where we smile with you and we don't like you
Just hopped off the plane, I just got out about a day ago
Everybody love me, when they see me they be like, "There he go!"
Got me a new lady, we 'bout to take a trip to Mexico
Crackers took my 40 so I'm 'bout to go buy a Draco

Early mornin', ridin' round, gettin' that money
I ask them for a plate, they left me hungry
So I'm out here wildin' out with my youngins
I need that skrilla, this lil' nigga love that fetti
I be smokin' broccoli, mama told me eat my veggies
Polo down, got me in here flexin', call me Ralph Lauren
I was in the projects stressin', I was still riding foreign
And I wrapped my wrist with VVS, and now I'm in here pourin'
You know the kid finessin', he's a savage young boy

My mama used to dig all in my stash (In my stash)

And I'm codeine dreaming, and I'm codeine dreaming)

[Chorus: Kodak Black]
I might take off on you peons and go away to Venus
I'm a star so I put a neutron on my pinky
I'm moonwalking but my Christian Louboutin's bleeding
I'm smoking moonrocks, shawty, and I feel the ceiling
I might take off on you peons and go away to Venus
I'm a star so I put a neutron on my pinky
I'm moonwalking but my Christian Louboutin's bleeding
I'm smoking moonrocks, shawty, and I feel the ceiling

[Verse 1: Kodak Black]
I'm in Uranus right now, I think I seen a demon
I thought I left you back there in the cell or am I dreamin'?
Say I ain't dealing witcha, dawg, I'm going a different way
I broke up with my redbone, I went the milky way
I'm ridin' in a Wraith, feeling like I'm outer space
Stars on my sunroof, Planet of the Apes
I couldn't wait until they released me, right back on the turf
I took off on you bustas, left you right on planet Earth
I feel like Jimmy Neutron, how I blast off on a verse
I know my son gon' like this song so I ain't finna curse
Know he gon' wanna explore the world so I'm gon' show him first
Say we just distinguished  beings, baby, me and you diverse

[Chorus: Kodak Black]
I might take off on you peons and go away to Venus
I'm a star so I put a neutron on my pinky
I'm moonwalking but my Christian Louboutin's bleeding
I'm smoking moonrocks, shawty, and I feel the ceiling
I might take off on you peons and go away to Venus
I'm a star so I put a neutron on my pinky
I'm moonwalking but my Christian Louboutin's bleeding
I'm smoking moonrocks, shawty, and I feel the ceiling

[Bridge: Kodak Black]
And I'm codeine dreaming, and I'm codeine dreaming
And I'm codeine dreaming

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
'Bout to take off on you peons and go back to Mars
'Bout to leave these peons behind like the Jackson 4
Tried to moonwalk on the moon and had to wax the floors
Tried to put me in a box and then I crashed the Porsche, err!
'Bout to wake up in your biatch and go back and forth, yeah
Got her trapping out the the Fiat, she be back and forth, yeah
'Bout to put myself together, take it back apart, yeah
Got the codeine on my breath, it smell like caviar, yeah
Codeine dreams and they come true too
That's my spaceship, brp-brp!
My milky way got pregnant, she said it's for you-hoo
FaceTime Kodak with my new new, I left you 'cause he knew you
I'm wet dreaming 'bout Actavis, two new cups feel like new boobs
Tunechi

[Chorus: Kodak Black]
I might take off on you peons and go away to Venus
I'm a star so I put a neutron on my pinky
I'm moonwalking but my Christian Louboutin's bleeding

I might take off on you peons and go away to Venus
I'm a star so I put a neutron on my pinky
I'm moonwalking but my Christian Louboutin's bleeding
I'm smoking moonrocks, shawty, and I feel the ceiling

[Verse 3: Kodak Black]
'Bout to go to Saturn, heard they got the baddest species
You can hit me on my Galaxy, you tryna reach me
I went to Mars to get some Xanax bars to go to sleep
I'm in my Orange space shuttle flyin' two seats
I left Future in Pluto 'cause that boy was too geeked
End up playing Sudoku all the way in Mercury
I took too much of shrooms feel like I'm on Neptune
I'm with an alien, she show me what that neck do
And I'm a metamorphosis, you just a regular dude
You need a space suit to get up on this latitude
If she ain't foreign, then she boring, I need a Zorcon
You takin' morphine, homie, you a moron

[Chorus: Kodak Black & Lil Wayne]
I might take off on you peons and go away to Venus
I'm a star so I put a neutron on my pinky
I'm moonwalking but my Christian Louboutin's bleeding
I'm smoking moonrocks, shawty, and I feel the ceiling (Yeah)
I might take off on you peons and go away to Venus
I'm a star so I put a neutron on my pinky

[Chorus: PnB Rock]
I done gave the jails too many years
Years that I won't get back
And I swear I done shed too many tears
For niggas that I won't get back
Yeah I got niggas in the graveyard
Niggas in the state yards
I swear not a day goes by
That I don't think about the times
I wish that I could rewind
'Cause I done gave the jails too many years
Years that I won't get back
And I swear I done shed too many tears
For niggas that I won't get back
Yeah I got niggas in the graveyard
Niggas in the state yards
I swear not a day goes by
That I don't think about the times
I wish that I could rewind

[Verse 1: Kodak Black]
I told my mama we gon' be fine
So I'm up all night way after sleep time
I'm just thinkin' 'bout Lil Kuda
Gave my dog a dime
He put a buckshot in a nigga's behind
No daddy so I grew up to the street life
But my son, I'ma keep him in the beehive
Scheming on a heist, I need to change my life
Been geekin' all night, I'm going senile
With two niggas toting three 4-5's
I seen a nigga play gangsta, then he broke down
Lost a lot, lost his mind in the courthouse
I'm on XXL, I'm in New York now

[Chorus: PnB Rock]
I done gave the jails too many years
Years that I won't get back
And I swear I done shed too many tears
For niggas that I won't get back
Yeah I got niggas in the graveyard
Niggas in the state yards
I swear not a day goes by
That I don't think about the times
I wish that I could rewind

[Verse 2: Kodak Black]
I keep thinkin' 'bout my niggas
I think I need a jigga
I would keep on falling victim
Lost up in the system
Miss my brothers and my sisters
Damn I miss my lil one
I know sometimes I be tripping
But I just miss my niggas
I got codeine in my liver
I gave the judge a piece of me
I'm too street for the industry
But I think that's where I need to be
'Cause verbally, mentally, and physically I keep that heat
Me and my brother fit in
We smoking one with PnB
Niggas say they fuck with me
But lowkey they be easin' me
Bitches don't mean shit to me
People tryna sentence me
How a youngin' posted on the street, gon' call it Sesame
1K 'til the death of me, don't put your life in jeopardy

[Chorus: PnB Rock]
I done gave the jails too many years
Years that I won't get back
And I swear I done shed too many tears
For niggas that I won't get back
Yeah I got niggas in the graveyard
Niggas in the state yards
I swear not a day goes by
That I don't think about the times
I wish that I could rewind

Only two can fit, fuck a four door (Fuck a four door)
Nigga, this a Jag, this is not a Ford (Not a Ford)
Polo to the floor, fuck that Tom Ford (Poppin' molly)
Nigga, this a Rollie, fuck that Michael Kors (Fuck that shit)
I'm in here movin' slowly, cause I poured a four (I'm on that shit)
Got her on her knees, like "forgive me lord" (Fuck that bitch)
I remember pullin' schemes, way in Baltimore (Remember I was hittin' licks)

[Chorus]
Why you, why you keep that tool like dat?
Why you move like dat? I hit the club 50 deep (With my niggas, ayy)
How you get so high like dat?
Why your eyes like dat?
Cause I put molly in my lean (In my lean, ayy)
Kodak, why you act like dat?
Why you strapped like dat?
Cause I got it by myself (By myself, ayy)
Nigga, I don't need no vitamin C
I be smokin' broccoli, they say it's good for my health (I'm the healthy kid)

[Verse 1]
I put my heart in my lyrics
I gave it all I could give
I made it hot at the crib
I kept that fire at the crib
Where you gon' go when you dip?
How I'ma know who for real?
I pour a four in a fifth
You already know what it is
I keep a pole in the whip
'Cause a lot of these niggas out here envy me
It ain't no ho in the clique
None of my dawgs got fuckboy tendencies
I don't even show no sympathy
Sipping on Hennessy, got me bending sideways
Everything on me drippin', you niggas can't ride the wave
Nigga run around with the juice, nigga come spill your drank
I done earn my stripes now I'm tryna go get me some real rank

[Chorus]
Readin' through my third eye 'cause I got tunnel vision
Had to open my mind, then I opened a Benz
It's like you gotta sell your soul for them to pay attention
Fuck all that playing, now I'm grown, I put my heart in it
I had to get down with that chrome to show them niggas I'm serious
And it's like every song I'm on, I be calling my spirits

[Verse 2]
I put my Hublot on rocks
I put Moscato on rocks
Where I'm from we don't say opp
Shoot at an OV, shoot at a cop
Shoot at the police, shoot at your top
I made a million off socks
Free all my niggas who stuck in a box
Locked up and watching the clock
Locked up, they fighting with locks
Locked up, they swinging they knifes
I can't be living this life
No more Bacardi, alright
I don't want Cardi so I'ma pour Henny on ice
My vision is vivid, told you I'm really a menace
I'll show you I'm destined to get it
I be outside with the glizzy
Toting that fire, I be trippin'
I just might die how I'm livin'
Ain't take no bath, but I'm drippin'
Niggas ain't catching me slipping, ayy, yeah
I make you laugh when you with me
Know that my swag is terrific (Glee, glee)
Ain't seen my dad in a minute
But I can't be mad, I got millions
I just pulled up in a lemon
Thuggin', so fuck your opinion
I'm thuggin', so fuck how you feeling
I'm calling my spirit

[Chorus]
Readin' through my third eye 'cause I got tunnel vision
Had to open my mind, then I opened a Benz
It's like you gotta sell your soul for them to pay attention
Fuck all that playing, now I'm grown, I put my heart in it
I had to get down with that chrome to show them niggas I'm serious
And it's like every song I'm on, I be calling my spirits

[Intro]
Damn girl, you so fine, I had missed you
I thought I was never gon' see you, dawg
Shit crazy

[Verse 1: Kodak Black]
At times I thought a nigga wouldn't ever see ya
But now I'm back out here and I won't ever leave ya
I was wilin' with my strap, I was totin' ninas
You know I pull up in the jag I want you in a bimmer
Tell my momma you my one and only girl I need ya
Tell my baby, you my lady, I just wanna please ya
I be pullin' on yo hair when I be stroking deeper
I know you don't like that smell when I be smoking reefer
You my favorite alphabet, they just wanna be ya
I remember poppin' checks, runnin' up the meter
I can take you to a place you thought you'd never go
I can do some things for you, you thought impossible
Man sometimes I just be thinkin' I won't ever make it
Cause I be goin' through a lot of situations
I'ma keep it real with you, girl I'm infatuated
I'ma show you that I love you I will never fake it
I remember drinking lean, living like the matrix
I always see you in my dreams, I love to see you naked
Girl you know I'm from the streets, yeah I'm a project baby
Wonderin' would you stay with me if I don't ever make it

[Chorus: Kodak Black]
Girl I miss you, I love ya
And I can't wait to touch ya
Girl you know that I just wanna kiss you and hug ya
Hold me down when I'm gone, I got in a lil' trouble
But one day I be home and together we gon' bubble

[Verse 2: Kodak Black]
I'm forever your lil' hustler
You so bad I don't want to see you fuckin' with no busta
To see your face again It got me captivated
Keep it real with me what you been doing lately
I need a jump right in that pussy, I feel like a virgin
After you drop that neck I'm gonna drop some verses
I ain't seen you in so long it got me feelin' nervous
I'm sorry for leaving you, ain't do that shit on purpose

[Chorus: Kodak Black]
Girl I miss you, I love ya
And I can't wait to touch ya
Girl you know that I just wanna kiss you and hug ya
Hold me down when I'm gone, I got in a lil' trouble
But one day I be home and together we gon' bubble

[Chorus]
I'm so tired of people telling you I'm doing things
I need you to stop accusing me of playing games
I been down this road before but this don't feel the same
Cause every time I hold you close it's like you ease my pain
You been riding for so long I hope you never change
Just ride with me down this road it ain't no switching lanes
It's like I'm feeling you more each and every day
I ain't letting you go don't you run away

[Verse]
Baby I won't up and leave you straight
I got your back forever I'ma make sure you straight
It's like I'm feeling you more and more every day
I'm asking God is this a blessing he just sent my way
You looking gooder than some cake I call you Anna May
Got her on her tippy-toes like she balleray
She heard I'm creeping with some hoe called Valarey
She thinking something going on she say I'm acting strange
Red Bull I'ma keep you up under my wings
I ain't saying I'm a vet but I'ma keep you tamed
Yellow baby love to squeeze her like lemonade
Running all around my mind like a skating ring
You the golden one you caught my eyes had to make you mine
Say you the chosen one you genuine you be down to ride

[Chorus]
I'm so tired of people telling you I'm doing things
I need you to stop accusing me of playing games
I been down this road before but this don't feel the same
Cause every time I hold you close it's like you ease my pain
You been riding for so long I hope you never change
Just ride with me down this road it ain't no switching lanes
It's like I'm feeling you more each and every day
I ain't letting you go don't you run away

[Intro]
Institution
Baby girl, damn, yeah, what it is girl
What it is
How you doing? (shit)
I think I wrote you a letter
Send me a kite back
Send me one back asap (asap)
You know you keep a nigga grounded
Man, you keep my head right
For real, I like dat
Look

[Chorus]
I'm missing you, I'm like what you doing?
What you getting into? Baby who you screwing?
I'm missing you, I'm like what you doing?
Tryna to get to you, but I'm in institution
I'm in institution, tryna to get to you, but I'm in institution
Aye, aye, aye, aye, aye

[Verse]
I got to write you a kite, I got to keep it real
I don't know when I'm coming home, thats how I really feel
I know its getting to you bad, you probably shedding tears
You hearing rumors, they saying I caught 11 years
I hope you understand, that it's the life I live
And this what come with a street nigga, girl that's what it is
I'm in this situation, but could you love me still?
Cuz I won't change on you, even if I get a record deal
I'ma rip my heart out my chest, put it in this envelope
They got me way in Virginia, with these Virginia folks
Without my momma and my brothers, girl you all I got
And could you send me some pictures? Cuz that would mean a lot
I'm wondering what you doing? And, where the hell you at?
And when I do get back, I hope you where I left you at
And if they send me to jail, would you send me a pack?
I'm in here writing raps, I'm in here getting fat
But one day I'll be back, they can't hold me forever
Okay now write me back, I'm waiting on your letter

[Chorus]
I'm missing you, I'm like what you doing?
What you getting into? Baby who you screwing?
I'm missing you, I'm like what you doing?
Tryna to get to you, but I'm in institution
I'm in institution, tryna to get to you, but I'm in institution
Aye

[Outro]
If I wasn't paper chasin', I'd probably never leave your side
Aye, aye

I clap a nigga like patty cake

[Verse 1]
Yeah, dat way
I'm 'bout to grab the Wraith, I'm 'bout to grab the key
I'm 'bout to snatch your baby girl and skeet all on her face
I got a feelin' that today gon' be a fantastic day
I'm gettin' tired of the Rollie, I think I want Patek Philippe
It's either I win or you lose, 'cause I won't accept defeat
And everybody wanna have the sauce, well I got the recipe
I'm sippin' on Belaire 'cause it make me feel like I'm on ecstasy
I love my baby, when I come home, I be rubbin' on her feet
And she be always in my chair, she hate when I be in the streets
My rims taller than my son, I'm 'bout to drop another one
You think a nigga in a band the way I hit him with that drum, ayy

[Chorus]
I'm sippin' on Belaire, my chick from Bel-Air
My whip from Germany, I'm cooler than LL
I'm sippin' on Belaire, my chick from Bel-Air
My whip from Germany, I'm cooler than LL

[Verse 2]
My chain VVS
I'm booted up, I got more pills than a CVS
I'm the shit, baby girl, so I got stains in my drawers
All this money like a nigga hit the fuckin' Power Ball
Sippin' on champagne, my whip on Dana Dane's
No time for you lames, I'm flyer than a plane
I'm ridin' like a train, she love to give me brain
You shootin' with your eyes closed, you ain't Sniper Gang
She held me down when I was gone, I bought her Audemars Piguet
I love her like I love my brother, so I let her be my connect
I put her thick ass in the vet, ten bracelets on her neck
You know lil' Kodak love to flex, I got my momma out the 'jects

[Chorus]
I'm sippin' on Belaire, my chick from Bel-Air
My whip from Germany, I'm cooler than LL
I'm sippin' on Belaire, my chick from Bel-Air

[Intro]
Tied, they dead, flies everywhere
Y'all know that, it's Lil Kodak, ay, you play, you lay
Ain't no punk in me, ain't no punk in me but I be pulling out the strap
Like I'm a dyke, or something

[Chorus]
I be pullin' out straps on these fuck niggas
I go Young M.A. on these dumb bitches
Like a dyke man, you niggas can't fuck with me
If a nigga says it's up, then it's stuck with me
What's the principle? Pimpin' ain't easy
I'm invincible, niggas can't beat me
Ayy, what's the principle? Pimpin' ain't easy
I'm invincible, niggas can't beat me

[Verse 1]
I was in the 8-5, me and Pac hittin' it
I been out six months, made four million
Slide in the 6-4, windows tinted
Nigga had to get low, them boys start hittin'
Fuck around, hit the lil' hoe with no jimmy
If a nigga say go, better go kill him
Said that Lil' Zo he cut throat with no feelings
Mama watch her lil' boy turn into a menace
I don't care, I go fed and get a life sentence
I want everybody dead, nigga no limit
I don't shake niggas' hands, 'cause I ain't friendly
When I pull up to the crib, have no pendants
I been leanin' to the right, like I'm on xannies
I been thuggin' all my life, I ain't romantic
When I whip out the .45, don't panic
When I whip out the .45, don't panic

[Chorus]
I be pullin' out straps on these fuck niggas
I go Young M.A. on these dumb bitches
Like a dyke man, you niggas can't fuck with me
If a nigga says it's up, then it's stuck with me
What's the principle? Pimpin' ain't easy
I'm invincible, niggas can't beat me
Ayy, what's the principle? Pimpin' ain't easy
I'm invincible, niggas can't beat me

[Verse 2]
New AP, flood, water on my butt like a tub
I got my lil' gun in the club, don't worry about me, I'm a thug
You a kill a street nigga, get a dime
If you kill a rap nigga, get a dub
Big chain on my neck, don't budge
Fuckin' DeJ Loaf like a stud
I swapped out the mic for the gun
I swapped out the ice for the mud
I swapped out the spice for the bud
Fuckin' on a dyke, I'm in love
I'm fuckin' with a dyke, she the one
Kodak don't show no remorse, I be automatic tryin' get a nigga touched
Kodak on tour, with his boys, say they got a whole gun store on the bus
Missy Elliott, come and sex me
Hoppin' off a jet, to a cheque, to a jet-ski
I beatbox a nigga like the music
I'm thuggin' in my Reebok, I never need Gucci
I don't even see the confusion
I'm fuckin' Young M.A., long as she got a coochie
Say she got the strap and the toolie, say she put the crack in her booty

[Chorus]
I be pullin' out straps on these fuck niggas
I go Young M.A. on these dumb bitches
Like a dyke man, you niggas can't fuck with me
If a nigga says it's up, then it's stuck with me
What's the principle? Pimpin' ain't easy
I'm invincible, niggas can't beat me
Ayy, What's the principle? Pimpin' ain't easy
I'm invincible, niggas can't beat me

[Intro]
I'm God-sent, I know I'm God-sent
I swear 'fore God
You know what I'm talkin' 'bout?
Now, I done overcame so much obstacles
Came up from up under so much rocks and shit
Even though I be out here schemin' like a demon semen
I know I'm God-sent
This gotta be God

[Verse 1]
I'm God-sent, like He sent me up so I can relay these messages
Like He use me as his vessel, like He use me as an instrument
Tryna locked me in a box, they hate how God just keep on blessin' me
They locked me in a box, I pray to God this ain't my destiny
I don't drink no lean, I'm sippin' on holy water like this my medicine
I'm a livin' testimony, every album like a testament
Everything I went through made me who I am 'cause he be testin' me
So I'm breakin' bread with all my fam 'cause I don't take no ecstasy
I done sacrificed my niggas 'cause none of my niggas see the best in me
They want me slingin' metal like the Devil, but I'm Heaven-sent
My brother, my mother them addicts fuck my daddy 'cause he neglected me
I'm 20 years old, but I act like I been here before, like I'm a veteran
He speak this shit through me like I'm a prophet, but I'm a reverend
Put my blood, sweat and tears in all these lyrics 'cause this my Exodus
I'm dyin' so I can live, so I can live, I resurrected it
I'm dyin' so I can live, so I can live, I resurrected it

[Chorus]
Ayy, blood in my eyes, I'm goin' blind, oh
Stuck in these streets, feel like my life froze
I've been runnin' these streets, got me dehydrated
I've been livin' so crazy, feel like I'm dyin', baby
Blood in my eyes, I'm goin' blind, oh
I'm stuck in these streets, feel like my life froze
I've been runnin' these streets, got me dehydrated
I've been livin' so crazy, feel like I'm dyin', baby

[Verse 2]
I just shot a nigga, now I can't sleep
My brother, he just washed me down with bleach, oh
Project baby, snotty nose, head peezy
Now everybody 'round the world tryna be me
Miss my niggas, hope they see me on the TV
I'm on Instagram showin' off my VV's
You won't understand that this wasn't easy
I been walkin' 'round with my head peezy
Shot a nigga, took a shower with the bleach, Yahweh
Mama, I fell victim to the streets, I'm sorry
I'm in middle school; sellin' weed in the hallway
I was skippin' school, got in beef, started robbin'
Jackboy, that's my G, we like Batman and Robin
God, I know you lookin' out for me through the darkness

[Chorus]
Blood in my eyes, I'm goin' blind, oh
Stuck in these streets, feel like my life froze
I've been runnin' these streets, got me dehydrated
I've been livin' so crazy, feel like I'm dyin', baby
Blood in my eyes, I'm goin' blind, oh
I'm stuck in these streets, feel like my life froze
I've been runnin' these streets, got me dehydrated
I've been livin' so crazy, feel like I'm dyin', baby

[Intro: Herman Blake]
Now, Minister Malcolm, the thing that I thought might be good for starting it off is to talk about one of the most pervasive beliefs in the general society about the Nation of Islam

[Verse 1: Kodak Black]
Talkin' to you like talkin' to myself
'Cause it ain't no gettin' through to you at all I swear
And I've been thinkin' 'bout you since I came to jail
I've tried to reach out to you, but it was to no avail
Guess it ain't nothin' else to do when we outgrew each other
We hard down beefin' like we never knew each other
Top off the coupe, no bikini, became our life now
I'm sippin' Bellini, livin' that lifestyle

[Interlude: Herman Blake]
And that is that it is an organization dedicated to the use of violent means to attain its goals. The question I have is, how true is this, and why do you think it persists in society?

[Verse 2: Kodak Black]
Poppin' pills, poppin' pistols, I put my mic down
I almost lost my life that night, I was on a bloodhound
They tryna tell us put the bikes up and the guns down
X was tryna buy a bike then he got gunned down
X was tryna change his life, but he got burned down
X wasn't ridin' with no pipe so he got gunned down
Listen, do as I say, don't do as I do
Nine out of ten, it ain't gon' end up lookin' good for you

[Interlude: Malcolm X]
Have never at any time been guilty of initiating any aggressive acts of violence during the entire 33 years or more that the honorable Elijah Mohammed has been teaching us. The'

[Verse 3: Kodak Black]
If I wasn't rich, you wouldn't be pullin' up to my funeral
First they kissin' you, huggin' you, then they suin' you
If it was me, it was you, I'm wonderin' what you would do
I just pulled up on your mama, homie, she beautiful
Yeah, gotta keep the strap, can't let you latch all on me
I got married to the game, she put these racks all on me
Now I got diamonds on my ring, look like a matrimony
First they screamin' my name, then file a lawsuit on me
You would hate to see me reach my full potential
You want me robbin', poppin' Mollies, poppin' pistols
I'm goin' to college 'cause to the youngins I'm influential
Thought it was Congress, they ain't know this was a Presidential
They ain't know that I was intellectual
You tryna change your life, but they won't let you
I know they know I'm special, why they playin' with me?
You talkin' jewels, I'm droppin' jewels, you see the difference
Coppin' jewels for your dawgs, they don't appreciate it
Everybody gon' say you fake when you make it
Back of the Maybach with the tints so you don't notice me
When the money bring the fame, you can't even roll in peace
Guess all the pain that I went through had to be the recipe
I stood tall through it all and brought out the best of me
Ayo, dismiss all them charges, that ain't my destiny
Everything I said, I stood on it, I got integrity
G.A., I put my hood on it, I bring the 'jects with me
You need security by your grave so you can rest in peace
Tide

[Outro: Malcolm X]
Charge of violence against us actually stems from the guilt complex that exists in the conscious and subconscious minds of most white people in this country. They know that they've been violent in their brutality against negros and they feel that some day the negro is going to wake up and try and do unto as them as they have done'do unto the whites as the whites have done unto us

[Intro]
Ayy, I'm just going through one of my old pads and shit, you know what I'm sayin'?
You know, a nigga so versatile I don't even need no auto-tune and none of that shit
I could sweep the flow up, the melody
Like I could speak to all her fans through every genre
I fuck wit this beat, tough though, ya heard
Helluva made this beat, baby
Everything on my path for this
I swear to God, dawg, I never imagined this
I remember I was out there on my savage shit, carjacking shit
On my snappin' shit, trappin' shit, ratchet shit

[Verse 1]
Seem like I lost more than I ever gained
Ain't get nun out these streets but pain
Ain't get nun out these streets but hard times
'Cause in these streets ain't nun but hard times
Tell C.B. I say wassup
Tell everybody I say what's happening
Tell E-Pimp I said shoot me som'in
Tell them boys I said stop flaggin'
Tell my momma that I'm comin' home
Tell the world that it won't be long
Ask my hoes wassup with they phones
Tell 'em I'm away but I ain't gone
I said boo bear what you wanna do
Once you slide, imma follow through
The stand took a nigga up and through it
Lil Dash told me, Kodak don't do it
Tell my son that I love his ass
Tell 'em I can't wait to hug his ass
This for the niggas who got all that time
Now they trying to give them numbers back
A nigga shot my cousin four times
I heard through the wall my brother doubled back
I just bumped into this super jit
I'm hollering at Lil Fam through the vent
I'm letting you know I do this shit for fun
Tell me go then consider it done
Shoutout Petho and my brother blood
My nigga C-Lo he just caught a thug
I'm shooting cee-lo in a nigga ass
They hit a nigga for his whole bag
Tell them boys I said stop crabbing
Send it even if I never asked
I knew I should've told my lil nigga DJ to chill
But I can't tell him shit he doin the same shit that I will
I'm thinking bout how would it be if we ain't get on them pills, if we ain't never chose the streets and picked up the steel
I'm thinkin' bout how would it be if we stayed on the field
Like I ain't even have to rap, 'cause I got other skills
At nights we ran down with them sticks and got them automobiles
And we was jackin' cars and shit 'cause it wasn't hard to steal
Like doin bids and seeing it come, but this the life I live
But I know that this my last one, something gotta give
Seem like God, got me paying for all the shit I did
'Cause I slowed down a while ago, switched up positive
The rough was just enough for a nigga fell in love with the thrill
But before he forgive me I gotta pay for it still
And I done did so much of shit that I ain't proud I did
But when I took rappin' serious I threw the towel in
But Lord you say you gon' forgive me, so forgive me then
'Cause I done picked the Bible up and read Corinthians
I'm still young and I got a lot to experience
I guess the first time in my life I felt this serious
I gotta lil boy now and I wanna be there for bruh
The feeling he give a nigga I ain't never felt this way before
And you can look into my heart and see that I'm forreal
That I done resulted in a metamorphosis
God, you know my destiny 'cause you gave me this gift
You the one who put this breath in me to make me spit these lyrics
You done gave a nigga a chance to pay my momma bills
You done turned me to a man unlike my daddy is

[Interlude]
No this ain't over, I got some more to spit
That was for the real niggas
I got some shit for the hoes

[Verse 2]
She made me happy, she made me smile
She brought me up, when you let me down
She nothing like you, she different
She nothing like you, she magnificent
She intelligent, she love me better than you
Better than, she love me better than you
She made me happy, she made me smile
She brought me up, when you let me down
Could you hold the title, it come with a life
Could you hold the title, you don't have to lie
Could you hold the title, could you play the role
You can't hold the title, baby let me know
Could you hold the title, could you play the part
Could you hold the title, till death do us part
Could you hold the title, hold a nigga down
Could you hold the title, tryna figure out
Take you out to dinner, stick this dick in your liver
I'm fuckin' your head up I'm playing these mind games witcha
I'ma suck that pussy good, then you ain't gon' hear from a nigga
I'm fuckin your head up with all these extracurriculars
I can fuck Virgin Mary, 'cause the game so unordinary
Had plans on gettin' married til they had me on solitary
You left me here stranded, I'm feelin' abandoned
You got me so hurt right now I need me a bandage
Transgression
Show you your corner, who gone stay solid and be down for you
When you really want 'em, when you really need 'em
When them people playing with your freedom
When a nigga shit on me one time but I be tryna get even
I'm tryna get equal
I'm iced out riding with that heater
I'm in that Thunderbird, I'm sliding with that Desert Eagle
Tell me who my people, show me where my folks at
Who gon' ride for Kodak?
Who gon' up and shake on me?
Who gon' jump the gate on me
Pillow case that thang on it
In case he tryna lay on me
Changed my address
But karma she know where I stayed on it
But that bitch better come correct she know that I stay on it
I ain't sleeping so forget about coming creepin' late on me
Got the 12 gauge on me
I got the 38 on me
I got the MAC-10, I used to have the baby 'K on me
I bought a Xbox but I don't play on it
PS4 but I don't play no games on it
The beat over got so much to say on it
My heart cold put a glacier on my wrist

[Interlude]
I'm forever abnormal
I know I wrote this shit longer than a average rapper
Ya'know I'm sayin glee
But you got me fucked up
I be damn if you don't let me keep ridin' this shit boy

[Verse 3]
I'm pulling scams, identity theft
Don't buy my album, 'cause I don't care
I'm pulling scams, identity theft
Don't buy my album, 'cause I don't care
I be damn if I don't find a way to make some cash
I be damn if she come over and she don't get mad
Be damned, I be damn if she think she gon' get a bag
I be damn if you get me and I don't get you back
187 you screw me and you get nailed
I wrote this in the cell, free my niggas who ain't tell
I be damn, I be damn if I  go out without the heat
I be damn if I take that nat nat out to eat
Boy you ain't livin' like that you know you ain't in the streets
Even my ho can get whacked, I be strapped when I be sleep
I be damn if you niggas come run up on me
I just called my woo man, told him pray over me
I be damn I be damn if I don't come home in a week
I be damn I be damn thinkin' a young nigga sweet
I be damn if she don't call me soon the molly kick in
I be damn if she don't tell she gon wanna turn up again
Yo bih gave me a key, put me on her lease
I'm standin' at the feast til they bring in me a beast
It's too much weight on my shoulder so don't tell me hold up
Feel my heart gettin' colder turning to a polar
Reppin' Broward County Florida, I'm from out the nolia
Project baby a lil Haitian from the ugly corner

[Verse 1: Jackboy]
Off top, chargin' extra for a rock
Finessin' all I know, that's how I grew up on my block
How you think I filled my shoebox up with knots?
Was thuggin' on the block, I ain't wanna punch a clock
I was gettin' bands while ya mans was gettin' hot
Sold my .22, he the reason I bought the Glock
Pop, one false move ya get shot
Catch me slippin', going with a smile like I'm Pac
Just want a bone, I'm a dog, nah I'm a beast
'Cause when I drop this dick, bet you tear up the sheets
'Cause when I drop this dick, bet you come back for more
I'ma come back 'til you suck me 'til ya throat sore
Aye, aye, aye ho nigga
Might just make you my bae
Just playin' hoe, come let me nut in yo' face
Nigga play with me I'ma knock off his face
Call Draco and Tae, they gon' let that bih spray
Gang, snipe 'em, bang bang
No drive-by, this personal, hit you close range
If we really beefin' why you put it on the 'Gram
If we really beefin' why you ain't thinkin' 'bout ya man, or ya fam
Can't catch you, they gettin' blammed
Easy to touch you, I don't gotta use my hands
Easy to touch you nigga when you got them bands
Nigga be hatin', lowkey he just a fan
On my block with the Glock, run down on a opp
Was a jit when they tried me, try me now they gettin' shot
Anybody try me now, on God they gettin' popped
Fuck nigga run up, swear yo' life gettin' robbed
Make a pussy nigga wish he went and got a job
Hit his ass with that rara, I'm a shotta
Free smoke, no ganja, Mad Max ya
Re-rock ya for actin', deserve a Oscar, boy ya fake
Real fragile, they be quick to break
Turnin' state, they jump on ya case, trap you in the gates
I know niggas doing time who ain't got release dates
Spendin' most of their time plottin' on a great escape
Niggas hate, guess all the loyalty been misplaced
This not a race but I chase the cake like I can't wait
No more dirt where I lay, so I stay outta state
I ain't tryna rack out so I stay out the way
From the draco to the .40 put respect on it
Aimin' at his head, he might have a vest on him
I'm from the Noya where a donk sit on Forgis
Ya gotta keep a .30 if ya ballin' like Curry
Sippin' lean, it got my vision blurry
Sippin' lean, got me movin' like a zombie
Got me reminiscin' when they tried to hide me
Throw away the key so they can't find me

[Verse 2: Kodak Black]
Yeah I'm on my grimace, mezanmi
Let the Glock pop and I pop molly
Stopped sellin' rocks cause I love robbing
Whole life you been on the block grinding
Yeah, you just wanna pop free molly
That's the only reason you 'round me
No, you cannot get on my IG
This a selfie, stop tryna get by me
Let me out the cage, now I'm in ya broad jaw
Cool cat, I'm a mut, I'm a raw dog
I know all you niggas thinkin' I'ma fall off
I just took a lil' break, y'all need to calm down
We be strapped in ya city like it's our town
In the field, straight fonk a nigga outta bounds
How you snap a play then call timeout
Blitz ya runnin' back, knock the whole line out
Yeah, once the pressure on, you can't call off
Nigga hopped on the phone and brought the cops out
I don't sell drugs so I don't come out
I'm posted in the cut with the sawed off
12 gauge on me, I ain't pump fakin'
I'ma serve foolie like the lunch lady
I ain't catch 'em dancin' in the cut lately
Trust me, I ain't come to throw no ones baby
I'ma dump when the thump make ya jump, shake it
Grab the pole, strip a fuck nigga butt naked
And you ridin' police escort safety
I was in the gym, now I got court cases
Nah, you don't want beef, you don't want ham
Nah, you don't want me, you don't want nan
You don't ya whole meat knocked off ya cranium
Leave a nigga swiss cheese, rat terminatin' 'em

[Intro]
You see, it's crazy, dog, 'cause
You give a nigga this emotion that
I thought ain't even exist in a nigga no more
See, like, I don't even wanna be, if I can't be with you

[Chorus]
I don't wanna live, if I can't be with you
Shawty, I don't want no air, If I ain't breathing you
Shawty, I don't wanna dream, if I can't sleep with you
Shawty, I don't wanna see, if I ain't seeing you
Shawty, I don't wanna live, if I can't be with you
Shawty, I don't want no air, If I ain't breathing you
Shawty, I don't wanna dream, if I can't sleep with you
Shawty, I don't wanna see, if I ain't seeing you
Shawty, I ain't seeing you

[Verse 1]
You know you make me new
You motivate me too
I'm fucking with you, boo
Imma keep it funky with you, boo
When we make love, I ain't got my glove on
When we make love, I ain't got my thug on
Girl, you got me singing love songs
Where the fuck I get this love from?
I got London on the beat
She like fucking on the beach
Girl, you fucking with a G
How did you end up with me?

[Chorus]
I don't wanna live, if I can't be with you
Shawty, I don't want no air, If I ain't breathing you
Shawty, I don't wanna dream, if I can't sleep with you
Shawty, I don't wanna see, if I ain't seeing you
Shawty, I don't wanna live, if I can't be with you
Shawty, I don't want no air, If I ain't breathing you
Shawty, I don't wanna dream, if I can't sleep with you
Shawty, I don't wanna see, if I ain't seeing you
Shawty, I ain't seeing you

[Verse 2]
Look what you did to a boss, babe
You got me nailed to the cross, babe
You got a young nigga open
You got my nose wide open
You got lil' Kodak in a moment
I was locked up sending you roses
And, baby, when I ride, I wanna ride for you
And, baby, when I die, I wanna die with you
Girl, you know Imma keep it a stack, like a thousand dollars, boo
Girl, you know Imma keep all this stack, I'd never lie to you
Ain't no point in living, If I can't live my life with you
Girl, If you ain't right by my side, I don't know what Imma do

[Chorus]
I don't wanna live, if I can't be with you
Shawty, I don't want no air, If I ain't breathing you
Shawty, I don't wanna dream, if I can't sleep with you
Shawty, I don't wanna see, if I ain't seeing you
Shawty, I don't wanna live, if I can't be with you
Shawty, I don't want no air, If I ain't breathing you
Shawty, I don't wanna dream, if I can't sleep with you
Shawty, I don't wanna see, if I ain't seeing you
Shawty, I ain't seeing you

Watch when they find out me and you been gettin' serious
Everybody ain't gonna like it when they hear
Girl, I don't care 'bout no fame, I make you famous
I don't care if that's the only reason you came for
These hoes always make me feel good, that money can't
I can't find no love so I went to the bank
I was outchea looking for love so I went to the bank
We met at B.O.A and then we met again at chase
Every thug need a shoulder they can lean on
I like what's on your shoulders, good head you be thinkin' on
Speakin' of head, I hate sex but I love my peter blown
You're a lil freaky hoe but you complete me, though
I'm sorry when I fuck I leave my bling on
I'm sorry when I fuck I leave my Rees on
See I'm a dog, I be just trynna get me a bone
He roam the streets alone you need to leave em alone
Stray dog, I don't need a home I don't be at home, I'm fleeing home
Raw dawg when I fuck her with no rubber but my ski is on
She heard I'm snot side nigga over there
She heard I'm snot sneaky nigga over there
They tellin' me she a thot, that hoe over there
But I don't even care if she have gonorrhea
They say she a sick bitch, I heard she got syphilis
But I'm going head first, jumpin' straight in it
I'm just kiddin' but I love that little babe
But I don't care if she a slut, she still my bae
And I don't need you telling me about how she do
She fuck everybody, and I fuck everybody too
Everybody say she out here trickin', I don't give a damn 'bout how she get it
Everybody say she got all the niggas So what? I got all the bitches
We got chemistry, fuck your history, I don't care if she was out here strippin'
I'm tellin' you baby, they ain't gon' like you jumpin' out that Bentley
Hittin' the scene in the Bimmer, I'm T-Double-D, you Trina
Everybody tellin' me she ain't shit, but nigga, I ain't shit either
And I don't give a damn 'bout none of that shit my nigga say
He tryna convince me he seen you on backpage
Everybody got an opinion, I don't give a damn anyway
I took her on a private plane, I took her on a dinner date
Everybody fuckin', everybody sinnin'
So what's wrong with turnin' that hoe into a princess
Yap, I can turn that hoe into a model
Scoop her in the Bentayga, no more Monte Carlo
If she ain't in a coupe with me, I want nobody in it
Bendin' corners wit' ya and my windows ain't even tinted
Babe, don't call me ese but I love it when we kick it
Fuck that he say, she say, it ain't nobody business
They ain't gon' like it, they ain't gon' like it
They ain't gon' like us, they gon' wanna fight ya
And I don't like people but I think I like her
I done let that hoe inside my heart now, wanna wife her
If I wife her I'm going Steve Austin with the ring
There's a stone cold diamond on her finger and it bling
I'm 'bout to cut off all my friends, I'm 'bout to cut off all my kin
Man, that pussy be pullin' me in, I thought it was a one night stand
I thought it was a one night stand like the lamp on my dresser
So she a lil dirty heifer, but this girl special
Thought it was a fling, thought she was a fling
I've been havin' dream lately, she might be my main
'Could you be my main? Could you be my baby?
Lifes gave me lemon, wonder could you be my main squeeze
Damn I fell in love with a nat
But every sinner got a future, and every saint got a past
So I ain't even finna hold her accountable to that
'Cause baby see you ride, yo, that lil' bitch, she got my back
Baby she be ridin', that lil' bitch, she got my back
And when we ride, yo, my 'lil bitch she hold the strap
My nigga startin' cryin' when we went out in scraps
My babe more real than you, she one thou, keep that shit a stack
I don't throw no money, took my bitch to the club and threw some racks
Man with the plan, master mind my crafts, no more shootin' craps
I ain't no dog but call me Ken with the Ben, fucking on a brat
My lil bitch a brat, I hate how she act
But I love how she act, that my lil diva
If you keep it up I'm put you on a TV-show
I was just trynna rap, you turned me to a singer
Found my focus back, turned me to believer

[Intro: Kodak Black]
Yeah, Project Baby
These streets took my conscience
Glee
Sniper Gang
These streets took my conscience

[Verse 1: Kodak Black]
Yeah, everybody with me on that same thang
I don't gang-bang but I bang bang
I pull up to the club, I got on eight chains
Took that bitch to Wings-N-Things, she wanna be my main

[Verse 2: Future]
Brown liquor made my dawg insane
Booted up or geeked, it's the same thang
Fish scale or molly, it's the same name
Murder by the stains, which gang you claim?
The big Patek face cost ten chains
Took your bitch out to eat on a private plane
Real talk, 150 when it's plain Jane
Fucked that junkie behind the dumpster for some cocaine

[Verse 3: Kodak Black]
Ayy, free my nigga Cool, he in the chain gang
Chris Johnson, I swear for God I drop the twenty-eight
I told my nigga be smooth (cool), he put a potato on a barrel
I kick her dumbass out my crib, say she want Chanel
I bought that bitch a lace 'cause she ain't got no hair
I sent that poor ass hoe a Uber 'cause she ain't got no wheels
Thirty golds in my mouth like I'm Stephen Curry
Thirty clip in my Glock 'cause I'm a damn Warrior

[Verse 4: Future]
Streets left me scarred, ain't no worries
Run my money up in a hurry
Thirteen strippers, James Harden
Money make you greedy when you starving
Monisha, Tamica, they vouching
Before I had anything, I was saucing
Before I had that Bentley truck, I was saucing
All these hitters, yeah, I pray you never cross them

[Verse 5: Kodak Black]
She say she pregnant, I swear I think I wanna off her
Eighteen hunded, I got more stories than a author
I'm credit card swipin' at the Chase Bank (ey)
Me and Future gang gang, same thang
I check your temperature, nigga, is you hot or cold?
Like a state trooper, I make my money on the road
I remember hittin' houses, nigga, cash 4 gold
These streets made me lose my conscience, took a nigga soul

[Verse 6: Future]
These streets took all my soul from me
Tried to leave me in the cold
These streets took my conscience from me
Now tough love is all I show
I know my niggas got love for me
And they filling up they nose
I know my Levi got love for me
She just want everybody to know

[Verse 7: Kodak Black]
I know my niggas, they be missin' me
So I be posted on the stroll
I don't even care about how much cash I see
I'm always gon' be in the 'No
I ran out of money, then they switch lanes
I ran it back up, then I switch lanes
In a brand new Range, diamond colored candy cane
I bought a brand new K, I can't wait to let it spray
I'm sorry mom ain't mean to bring you through so much pain
I said I'm sorry mom, I ain't mean for it to be this way
Ayy but fuck it, bitch, I'm here, I got diamond rings
All the finer things, designer jeans, I'm gettin' paid

[Outro: Kodak Black]
These streets took my conscience
All the finer things, designer jeans, I'm getting paid
These streets took my conscience
All the finer things, designer jeans, I'm getting paid
All the finer things, designer jeans, I'm getting paid
All the finer things, designer jeans, I'm getting paid

[Intro]
Glee

[Verse]
I can't let these niggas knock me off my pivot
God sat me down and talked to me, I listened
I was in that cell, he told me that I'm gifted
I don't make it in the booth, then I'ma make it in the kitchen
I'm special with the mic, special with the whippin'
I ran out of money, had to pay attention
All the people that was 'round me, they ain't have my best interest
You ain't have my best interest
You lazy with yo' loyalty and yo' position
And now I gotta execute 'cause you don't listen
That throwaway on me dumpin' with precision
I know shawty only on my trail 'cause she see a ticket
I'm readin' between the lines and peepin' they intentions
Can't have you niggas around me, shit gon' go to missing
I had to press that bump, I had to feel it
You know if it ever come down to it, a nigga with it
All these drugs got the whole world jiggy
Hoes comin' out they clothes and niggas trippin'
Why hit the top to go back to the bottom?
All these bitches fallin' for me like it's Autumn
I'm tryna tell you, homie, you don't want none
They freed me so I'm right back to that mon-yun
Somebody tell these niggas they don't want none
Kodak Black but I'm spreadin' blue hundons
They sent my nigga Cool on the fuckin' run
When they let him out of prison, I'll be 31
I knew I was a star when I was sellin' hard
Everybody told me I would make it when I was on the block
See, before this rap shit, I was jackin' cars
I couldn't get all my time 'cause I was doin' fraud
Me and my nigga Lil' Marcus tearin' up the Wyatt
It hurt me to my heart, heard they gave him 25
I'm from the Noya, all I know is slang that iron

[Outro]
Just like I told you, if I'm lyin' then I'm flyin'
Just like I told you, if I'm lyin' then I'm flyin'
Just like I told you, if I'm lyin' then I'm flyin'

[Verse]
First day out
Gave my mama hundred racks
And bought a iced-out AP watch
And bought a Cuban links just to match
That was voodoo, that was magic
Nigga be cappin', I just be laughin'
That was God, nigga was fastin'
And hidin' K2 in my mattress
Smokin' Tunechi in my cell
That was my twelfth time going to jail
That was my second time going to hell
And back for real but I prevail
Canary yellow diamonds in my bracelets
Same color as my lady
'Bout to hit her with no Jimmy Mack
And go half on a baby
'Bout to hit her with no Jimmy
Have her walkin' like a penguin
Still finessin', still be poppin' fraud finagling and wangling
And a brand new two-door Wraith
I coulda bought it but I just rent it
Got a brand new big old chain
Got so much sauce I don't need no pendant
Paintin' pictures when I be spendin'
I'm poppin' flo-rhythym on all these women
It's my birthday, just turned 20
And I just went to go see the dentist
Put some stones all in my gold
Know you niggas thought I was gone
Know you niggas thought I wasn't comin' home
But guess what, bitch I'm home
On probation, but I still keep that chrome
Crack a nigga dome
(On probation but I still keep that chrome
I'll crack a nigga dome)
Traded my AR for a sniper, traded my Draco for a TEC
Traded my Rollie for a AP but I coulda got a Patek
And I coulda got a Corvette, and I coulda got me a jet
And I coulda got me some sex, but I only got me some neck
Traded my ex bitch for a check
I'm takin' codeine with the x
I wanna buy my brother the world
But since I can't, I'ma get him a Lex
Ayy ayy, I'm a Israelite my diamonds is real ice
I had to sacrifice to be here, that's how I'm with you tonight
I had to run down with my big Glock 9 to feed my appetite
I had to go through hard times and dark times for me to see the light
Ay, I remember pourin' honey on my rice
Ay, I remember havin' no money, I was livin' in shacks
Ay, you got me fucked up if I'ma go out without a fight
Ay, this my first day out, I'ma live it up tonight

[Outro]
Live it up tonight
This my first day out, I'ma live it up tonight
Live it up tonight
This my first day out, I'ma live it up tonight
Live it up tonight
This my first day out, I'ma live it up tonight

[Intro]
You know life ain't tied with a bow but it's still a gift though
Yeah life ain't fair but it's still good though
It's a blessing just to be here
Everything 1K

[Hook]
I know you're money hungry
Can't wait 'cause you ain't eat all day
And you gon' lose your mind if you don't get a plate
I understand the ups and the downs, street niggas gon' relate
It's a struggle man, I'm with you all the way
This for all the soldiers fell victim to the system
Everyday that goes by they so close to losing faith
I gotta thank God for everything
It's a miracle how you'll wake up and your dreams right in your face
Everything 1K

[Verse 1]
I woke up in the morning on a cold slab
How the hell I'm in a damn cell
I'm in jail taking cold baths
I went down the wrong path
Lil boy don't go that way
You prolly won't last
Before I had the fame I had the name
I earned my stripes like Adidas
Sliding base like I'm Derek Jeter
Growing up with no father, it'll make you evil
How he gon' learn to be a man when you ain't never teach him?
Youngin' can't even read but he totin' the Desert Eagle
Look how she left, I bet she told you she won't never leave you
The same nigga was hating, I turned them to believers
I done made it through the rain and I ain't called FEMA

[Hook]
I know you're money hungry
Can't wait 'cause you ain't eat all day
And you gon' lose your mind if you don't get a plate
I understand the ups and the downs, street niggas gon' relate
It's a struggle man, I'm with you all the way
This for all the soldiers fell victim to the system
Everyday that goes by they so close to losing faith
I gotta thank God for everything
It's a miracle how you'll wake up and your dreams right in your face
Everything 1K

[Verse 2]
I probably thank God 'cause without him who is me?
He unlocked my cell when they threw away the key
Jailbird, I was caged in, he came and set me free
I was just on the news, now I'm on MTV
Hurting 'cause your people ate and you ain't get a piece
Now you're taking from your people plate 'cause you just tryna eat
Grinding for a mil and I ain't talkin' 'bout a combo
My mama need a crib, I been thinking 'bout a condo
You nothing when you down, it's crazy how people treat you
Come around now, you can't even hit the reefer
I pray for all my youngins who done took the same route
Brother from the same struggle, cut from the same cloth

[Hook]
I know you're money hungry
Can't wait 'cause you ain't eat all day
And you gon' lose your mind if you don't get a plate
I understand the ups and the downs, street niggas gon' relate
It's a struggle man, I'm with you all the way
This for all the soldiers fell victim to the system
Everyday that goes by they so close to losing faith
I gotta thank God for everything
It's a miracle how you'll wake up and your dreams right in your face
Everything 1K

My name is Kodak but you know that already
I don't want the wap baby I just want the fetty
Polo to the socks homie this ain't Perry Ellis
Let me get the raw I'm a ball like spaghetti
It's getting hot in here the block be hot no not Nelly
You can keep the Rari, I'd rather have a Chevy
I don't want no head lately I've been getting becky
I just want the bread, keep the peanut butter jelly

[Verse 1]
She walked up to me, I was by the bar, she was like hello
She rolled up on me, I was rollin up my cigarillo
No I don't fuck with Grabba leaf I'm breaking down the elpo
I'm always smoking loud I can't keep it on the LO
Girl I don't like the way your booty flop, it's like jello
And now I'm rockin Robin Jeans remember wearing Ecko
She say she just came to chill look bitch this ain't a Getty
I told that bitch get outta here, act like you never met me
I'm up the road I'm lurking for them books, no library
Lil niggas state-to-state I get more cake than lil Debbie
No I can't save a hoe I'm no neighborhood hero
Keep that shit 1K I can't be fuckin wit a zero

[Hook]
My name is Kodak but you know that already
I don't want the wap baby I just want the fetty
Polo to the socks homie this ain't Perry Ellis
Let me get the raw I'mma ball like spaghetti
It's getting hot in here the block be hot no not Nelly
You can keep the Rari, I'd rather have a Chevy
I don't want no head lately I've been getting becky
I just want the bread, keep the peanut butter jelly

[Verse 2]
Boy I need that green bought my green no asparagus
Lord forgive me please cut the money I just cherished it
Hit a mean lick I took that money and I buried it
She get on her knees OMG that's embarassing
I don't need no record deal but you gon hear my record still
Me and DJ on the pill we spinning like a ferris wheel
Oh that's Kodak Black who they be talking bout,that's the nigga
First I had to grow to be the man like a caterpillar
Once that jit was old enough to thug it he was thuggin
He just found a strap now he cut you like it's nothing
I use to pour fours now I pour a whole dozen
Bumped into Lil Wally in the hood, hey cousin

[Hook]
My name is Kodak but you know that already
I don't want the wap baby I just want the fetty
Polo to the socks homie this ain't Perry Ellis
Let me get the raw I'mma ball like spaghetti
It's getting hot in here the block be hot no not Nelly
You can keep the Rari, I'd rather have a Chevy
I don't want no head lately I've been getting becky
I just want the bread, keep the peanut butter jelly

[Intro: Kodak Black]
DJ Swift on the track
My mama always told me 'bout that water, boy
Dubba-AA flexin'
She said, "Boy that water deep, boy don't get in that water"
I still got in that water
This is the sound

[Chorus: Kodak Black]
My mama always told me 'bout that water
And I said, "Okay ma, I'm just gon' put my feet in"
I'm sorry ma, I got right in that water
I ain't never notice I was going deep in
Lately I've been working overnight
I can't party on the weekends
Like, why the hell you even in my life?
Tell me what's your real reason
I pulled up, drop my ceiling
I'm catchin' flights, you catchin' feelings
My diamonds wet, her pussy leaking
Ran up a check, then went to Neiman's

[Verse 1: Kodak Black]
Like a kickstand I'm in here leaning
Them crackers let me out, swear it feel like I'm dreaming
Michael Jackson, yeah, that case I beat it
Fuck them hard slabs, now I sleep on Tempur-Pedic
I'm going hard 'cause my family need me
Mama said if I believe it, I can achieve it
Can't trust these niggas, they misleading
Can't trust these hoes, they so deceiving
I let him eat then he got greedy
I need a lifeguard, I'm in the deep end
I told that bitch I'm never leaving
I'm outta here, I'm going to Venus
My mama always told me, I ain't listen
So now I'm dealing with the consequences
I dive right in that water, went to swimming
Gotta watch out for these niggas, they be fishing

[Chorus: Kodak Black]
My mama always told me about that water
And I said, "Okay ma, I'm just gon' put my feet in"
I'm sorry ma, I got right in that water
I ain't never notice I was going deep in
Lately I've been working overnight
I can't party on the weekends
Like, Why the hell you even in my life?
Tell me what's your real reason
I pulled up, drop my ceiling
I'm catchin' flights, you catchin' feelings
My diamonds wet, her pussy leaking
Ran up a check, then went to Neiman's

[Verse 2: NBA Youngboy]
Down on my ass, I had to get my feet in
They had told me change my ways but I ain't wanna listen
I looked my son in his eyes, I can't fail my mission
I say my prayers and tote my thang, I know they wanna kill me
Wake up in the morning, ain't got none' to eat
I had to man up to get on my feet
I go to Bay just to fuck with KD
Can't even swim but I'm deep in that sea
Got my first gun and I ain't pay a thing
Since I was young I've been slanging that heat
It be some massacres right on my street
It be some massacres right on my street
Remember they ain't gave me shit when I ain't had nothing
They want my spot but fuck them niggas, I'm focused on money
On everything, she say she love me I know she don't love me
3Three ain't round for to watch me, think I'm feeling something
My momma told me stack my M's, told me watch my homies
But I ain't listen Joe got shot, and he told on me
My uncle told me they ain't right, all them niggas phony
Can't lose it all for somebody who don't care about you

[Chorus: Kodak Black]
My mama always told me about that water
And I said, "Okay ma, I'm just gon' put my feet in"
I'm sorry ma, I got right in that water
I ain't never notice I was going deep in
Lately I've been working overnight
I can't party on the weekends
Like, Why the hell you even in my life?
Tell me what's your real reason
I pulled up, drop my ceiling
I'm catchin' flights, you catchin' feelings
My diamonds wet, her pussy leaking
Ran up a check, then went to Neiman's

[Intro]
Ayy, ayy
Out here you gonna eat or starve, man
I'ma need what's on your plate, gimme that
Everything 1K over here
I'm hungry
Ayy, look

[Verse 1]
Royalty can't buy you loyalty
Tell me, if I lose everything
Would you be over me?
I'ma tell you like they told me
This fame it ain't immortally
I ain't finna go switch oversea
Ain't no money controlling me
Black boy gave me a throwaway
I kept that shit, I ain't throw it away
Ten bands for the Jaguar
When I wrecked that shit, I remember that day
Been up, I been on my back
Now I'm up like an insomniac
Remember I made my first stack
When Wally had that Pontiac
Went to jail and I came back
Went through hell and I came back
Was in my cell, recreating myself
I died, and then I came back
Wondering where my partners at
Ain't write me and I acknowledge that
Snoop had me selling powder bags
He ain't even give me a dollar back
Later on, started sneaking shit in my pocket like it's contraband
Finessin' had me lookin' back at my profit, I had seven bands
Me, Mark, Greg, Tracy went up the road, hit for eleven bands
Project Baby, Taliban
It's Kodak, run and tell a friend
It's for my mama, she love me
She just want the best for me
Told me I should be in the booth instead of posted up on the ugly
Was in the club on that Hennessy
Now you see me sippin' bubbly
All the stripper hoes on me
I ain't even gotta throw money
I ain't even gotta throw money

[Chorus]
I'ma young prodigy
Now my plate filet mignon
No more collard greens
Doctor told me, "eat my veggies"
I'm smokin' broccoli
If you wasn't in the trenches with me
You can't rock with me
I'ma young prodigy
Now my plate filet mignon
No more collard greens
Doctor told me, "eat my veggies"
I'm smokin' broccoli
If you wasn't in the trenches with me
You can't rock with me

[Verse 2]
I was cheatin' on my girlfriend
I fell in love with finesse
Now I'm married to the money, catch me stuntin' on my ex
Call it Smackdown, hit your bitch with the triple X
Need a Gatorade break, they caught me running up a check
Ever since a youngin', I been runnin' up the guap
Coulda ran track, but I was busy runnin' from the cops
I'm a young Haitian
VVSes in my watch like a Dalmatian
Bitch I got one hundred and one spots
Remember playing Lego, now I'm really on the blocks
Smoking loud, got my eyes so low I look like Fetty Wap
Jumpin' out ya window like Jeff Hardy
I'm a dirty nigga, boy, I got your bitch turnt up on molly

[Chorus]
I'ma young prodigy
Now my plate filet mignon
No more collard greens
Doctor told me, "eat my veggies"
I'm smokin' broccoli
If you wasn't in the trenches with me
You can't rock with me
I'ma young prodigy
Now my plate filet mignon
No more collard greens
Doctor told me, "eat my veggies"
I'm smokin' broccoli
If you wasn't in the trenches with me
You can't rock with me

[Intro]
I'm livin' like "catch me if you can," you know?
This the amazin' true story of the youngest and most darin' conman
Tricky, swiftly, but yet viciously
It's always a mystery
Every day a new identity
I ain't talking cereal, but
I got all the tricks
Silly bitch, and I'ma finesse kid
Yeah, we ain't got nothin' for you tricks but some rabbit food
I could be ya professor 'cause I'll school ya
I shoulda been born in April 'cause I fool ya

[Chorus]
Gemini, woke up on the wrong side of the sheets
Like really I shoulda been born on Halloween
I ain't no demon semen but I do evil deeds
My daddy don't ever see me, I ain't no devil's seed
I don't remember his last time checking up on me
Why you drop another album in a week?
I'm a wolf but I be dressing like a sheep
Put on my monkey suit and go orangutan

[Verse 1]
Popping monkeys, popping bottles, make me swing
Who the fuck you walking in and out my dreams?
I know I'm smart, you make me do some crazy things
Monkey on my back, let a nigga be
Please, niggas free out here but they ain't free
You out here physically, locked up mentally
'Bout everywhere I go, I gotta bring the ski
No face, no case, live everyday like Halloween

[Chorus]
Gemini, woke up on the wrong side of the sheets
Like really I shoulda been born on Halloween
I ain't no demon semen, but I do evil deeds
My daddy don't ever see me, I ain't no devil's seed
I don't remember his last time checking up on me
Why you drop another album in a week?
I'm a wolf but I be dressing like the sheep
Put on my monkey suit and go orangutan

[Verse 2]
I'd trick so much individuals for a treat
K Boogie with a Hoodie, best believe
It's hot he got the hoodie on to hide the heat
And he got so much tricks up his sleeve
All the nights I had to mask up on the scheme
My subconscious got me fighting in my sleep
I can't forget about it I see it in my dreams
I'm kicking in your door, but I don't want no sweets
I'm giving you what I came for so I can leave
You know I'm serious don't you feel my energy
No this not a joke, everybody on they knees
Don't try to buck jack, you get buckeyed back

[Chorus]
Gemini, woke up on the wrong side of the sheets
Like really I shoulda been born on Halloween
I ain't no demon semen, but I do evil deeds
My daddy don't ever see me, I ain't no devil's seed
I don't remember his last time checking up on me
Why you drop another album in a week?
I'm a wolf but I be dressing like the sheep
Put on my monkey suit and go orangutan

[Verse 3]
You ain't gotta be scared just respect a nigga please
I'm starting to think my cranium got a disease
They be like yo Kodak I just seen you on the scene
They be like I ain't approach you though, cuz you was looking mean
Don't need no friends I gotta big family
I'm a G, it's in my genes
Glock 23, it's in my jeans
You playing freeze tag but I got that beam
Sorry baby I lied, you was just a fling
I don't love ya, I just wanna get in yo jeans
Tricked her for her treat, tricked her out her panties
I can't get romantic
No I'm not satanic

[Outro]
I'm not satanic
Who said that?
Why you said that?
Who said that?

[Intro]
Yeah
This my shit right here
This my kinda shit right here
Y'all know me, the son

[Chorus]
Can I ball? Can I chill?
Can I stunt?
Will I live long enough to raise my son?
Made something out of nothin'
Ain't nothin' where I'm from
Can your boy do something productive for once?
And once a nigga make it, they gon' wanna take it
Money don't change ya, but it do drive ya crazy
Lil' nigga out the projects, they rootin' for the baby
Even when you showin' love, they still gon' wanna hate ya

[Verse 1]
If I tell you how I feel, can I fuck?
I gotta see if the pussy good before I cuff
I'm really in the field so I need someone to hug
I'm out here like for real so I be needin' a little love
All you gotta do is grind
It's gon' take time
Ain't no time to chill
Ain't no time to vibe
All my people wanted me to sit my ass down
But I been on go since I got off my behind
Everybody wanna shine
Nobody wanna grind
See my nigga workin' hard, that shit paid him off fine
None of this shit just fall from the sky
I'm puttin' in work, I done forgot that I was tired

[Chorus]
Can I ball? Can I chill?
Can I stunt?
Will I live long enough to raise my son?
Made something out of nothin'
Ain't nothin' where I'm from
Can your boy do something productive for once?
And once a nigga make it, they gon' wanna take it
Money don't change ya, but it do drive ya crazy
Lil' nigga out the projects, they rootin' for the baby
Even when you showin' love, they still gon' wanna hate ya

[Verse 2]
Can a nigga eat in peace?
You leechin' for a crumb
Niggas ain't even showin' ya love where ya from
Them people took my 40s, so I'm about to go buy a pump
What if the trolls roll up on me right? Should I run?
Can I take you out to lunch?
I just wanna get you full then get all in your stomach
I just made shawty tell a man that she done
Lately she been tellin' me she love me, should I run?
I'm gone, I'm done
I shook and went describin'
I'm not a bad kid, I just didn't have no guidance
Fuck a home run, you boys be runnin' in houses
Robbin', connivin', wylin' and burglarizin'

[Chorus]
Can I ball? Can I chill?
Can I stunt?
Will I live long enough to raise my son?
Made something out of nothin'
Ain't nothin' where I'm from
Can your boy do something productive for once?
And once a nigga make it, they gon' wanna take it
Money don't change ya, but it do drive ya crazy
Lil' nigga out the projects, they rootin' for the baby
Even when you showin' love, they still gon' wanna hate ya

[Intro]
In my own bubble nigga, had to clear my circle up
Cause wasn't nobody with me when I was piped out in the box
Kodak Black, I'm the truth man
This another one

[Hook]
In my own bubble nigga, had to clear my circle up
Cause wasn't nobody with me when I was piped out in the box
Grab them one for ones and end up goin' double par
You would think a nigga homeless, man he stay on the block
Remember we were homeless, man I stay tryna plot
I was going up top and hiding pieces in my socks
Find another route, and I turned it up a notch
Had to quit half steppin', had to give it all I got

[Verse 1]
Fuck the FPL, bitch we buckin' all the power
I been doing well since I bumped into that power
Yeah them niggas straight, but ain't no nigga like a nigga from Broward
Running out of mollies so I laced her up with powder
Young nigga, I just wanna lay low and chill
Hoe don't call me Kodak thought I told you call me Bill
You know a nigga clutching got to keep that thang concealed
Nigga what's the point of doing it if you ain't gon do that shit for real?
Damn man, I thought Ian Rapport keep it real
Used to fuck with Carlo 'till he showed me what it is
Can't believe Dieuson, looked up to him when I was lil
I ain't even shocked, kinda expected that shit from Khalil

[Hook]
In my own bubble nigga, I had to clear my circle up
Cause wasn't nobody with me when I was piped out in the box
Grab them one for ones and end up goin' double par
You would think a nigga homeless, man he stay on the block
Remember we were homeless, man I stay tryna plot
I was going up top and hiding pieces in my sock
Find another route, and I turned it up a notch
Had to quit half steppin', had to give it all I got

[Verse 2]
Best believe let it sit too long and it's gon' rot
I seen it comin', once you leave your home we in ya spot
I'm in school, I got a glue stick, filled it up with rock
If I up it, I'mma shoot it, 40 with a cock
40 with a dick, yeah, extendo on my Glock
Cash for gold I use to catch a city bus way to the swap
I done growed up, young nigga 18
Mondo let me hold a 9 and that shit there got a beam
Went on a lil mission by myself, only me
Niggas tryna intervene, come between a nigga dream
Lil JackBoy he just call me I'm like "What's up, what you need?"
Even though he straight, I still sent him something for canteen

[Hook]
In my own bubble nigga, I had to clear my circle up
Cause wasn't nobody with me when I was piped out in the box
Grab them one for ones and end up goin' double par
You would think a nigga homeless, man he stay on the block
Remember we were homeless, man I stay tryna plot
I was going up top and hiding pieces in my sock
Find another route, and I turned it up a notch
Had to quit half steppin', had to give it all I got

[Intro]
True story, ain't no lyin'
A wise man can play a fool but a fool can't play wise
Unless you judge me by my cover so you can't read between my lines
I'm a street poet, poetical genius
Y'all need me, believe me
They ain't know that I was intellectual
Tryna change your life, but they won't let ya
I'm in Detroit right now
Just hollerin' at my nigga Wiz

[Verse]
I was hollerin' at my boy, he say he feel like he gon' die soon
Had to pray for him because he need it more than I do
How can I tell my people that's exactly the way I feel?
But I know that I'm blessed, so I won't give a bitch that idea
Runnin' from the Jakes, I was posted up with a 9 mill
Got me jumpin' gates, I got credit cards in my high heels
All my niggas fake, that shit kept comin' out like diarrhea
Syko on my line, I'ma pick him up, he in Liberia
Wiz, he just whipped up a brick and he ain't put no noodles in it
Told him I just caught me a fish, so don't put no tuna in it
They know that I'm baptized in blood, I let my soul sing it
Runnin' round wildin', I'm childish, I ain't got no home trainin'
Talking to my lil' boy, I promise won't let them boys kill me
Lookin' at my lil' boy like, "Father, don't let them boys steer me"
Nigga tried to trap me, I saw it, they say that boy slippery
Niggas tried to trap me, I saw it, they say that boy slippery
Young nigga stickin' to the code, 'cause I don't condone snitchin'
I ain't goin' out like that rapper, I won't do no tippin'
Willie said my name on the TV, that boy a bold witness
On the news he T.I.P.'d me, that boy got no feelings
Suwoop put the pole on lil' buddy, they said The Game strippin'
Old heads ain't hittin' on nothin', I say them boys kiddin'
I want all the smoke out the stove, but I don't even roll Phillies
How the hell you callin' me out when you know I don't listen?
How you try and put me in timeout when I ain't Big Boy children?
Nigga waitin' on for me to fall off just like that boy Gillie
Said they ride for me 'til the wheel fall off, I be like, "Oh really?"
How you tell me what came out my mouth, you don't even know Nipsey?
Tiny, that bitch ugly as hell, I don't even want Piggy
I can't beat you niggas at talkin', give me a long sentence
Know I keep the pole and I ain't no ho, I know some Rollin 60s
And I'm thuggin' all on my lonely, but I keep some Zoes with me
How the hell you cancel a nigga, and I don't even smoke tobacco?
Mute me when I voice my opinion, and I ain't even know it mattered
Jump right on my live and record me, everything I say be Platinum
Special kind of nigga, they know me, they want my name slandered
Special kind of nigga, they know me, they want my name slandered
My head right on the swivel, I'm focused, they want my brain splattered
How the hell you cancel a nigga, and I don't even smoke tobacco?
Mute me when I voice my opinion, and I ain't even know it mattered

[Hook]
If you ain't ridin, don't even act like you ridin
Cause I ain't tryna be out here wastin' my time
Keep it real, don't leave me in the blind
Cause I ain't tryna be out here thinkin you mine
Don't be having me out here thinkin you ridin
If I can't call on you, stop bangin' my line
Ion want nobody to be feedin' me lies
Cause Ion even be like to swallow my pride

[Verse 1: Kodak Black]
Free Lil Kooda, he walk round with that 9
Free Lil Kooda man they gave him a dime
I like when you suck my dick while I drive
But let a nigga know is you really gon' ride
Is you really gone ride, even if they flat all our tires
Be hoppin cars and hotwires, till we get a brand new s5
I still fuck wit lil Robert he knew me since I was 5
Ain't even lookin at yo ass, I got my eyes on the prize
You ain't got lie to kick it, you can leave you can stay
And whoever told you that I needed you anyway
I ain't talkin bout no suit, I'll call a whole new case
I just wrote my nigga Cool like let me know if you straight
You be actin like you real but you know damn well you fake
I'm just thinkin bout lil jackboy it's his birthday today
I might cop a q8 we just got a new place
I keep my heart pumpin blood, all you lil niggas koolaid

[Hook]
If you ain't ridin, don't even act like you ridin
Cause I ain't tryna be out here wastin' my time
Keep it real, don't leave me in the blind
Cause I ain't tryna be out here thinkin you mine
Don't be having me out here thinkin you ridin
If I can't call on you, stop bangin' my line
Ion want nobody to be feedin' me lies
Cause Ion even be like to swallow my pride

[Verse 2: Kodak Black]
Keep it real with me, don't know why you lyin
You out here thuggin but you scared to do time
I kept it real with you, I never been slime
They don't know how I stayed up on the grind
What I had to do to survive cause all they see is the shine
They don't see these bags under my eyes, they see the paint on my ride
When I was down bad on my lonely, where was you were you there
When i was lost and i was lonely, where were you, did you care?
Don't be having me out here thinkin you for me when you there
You would hate to see me win, i know you want me to fail
Went to school got expelled, jumped off the porch i was 12
I ain't goin back to jail, no more thuggin I swear
You want loyalty but you ain't even loyal yourself
You a clown, you went down fuckin told on yoself
That's why my circle so tight, cause ion fuck wit you squares
Those cold nights in that cell, where were you was you there

[Hook]
If you ain't ridin, don't even act like you ridin
Cause I ain't tryna be out here wastin' my time
Keep it real, don't leave me in the blind
Cause I ain't tryna be out here thinkin you mine
Don't be having me out here thinkin you ridin
If I can't call on you, stop bangin' my line
Ion want nobody to be feedin' me lies
Cause Ion even be like to swallow my pride

[Intro]
Ayy, look, I say "I don't rap, I illustrate. I don't paint pictures, I picture-paint." Ha, this my motherfuckin' album
Kodak Black-
Kodak Black-
The nineteen-year-old Pompano Beach rapper-
-is reportedly back in jail after he was arrested today in Broward County, Florida
Real name is Dieuson Octave, changed his plea from not guilty to no contest
Mr. Octave, do you accept your plea?
-in the two terminal cases that have put his musical career on hold
-troubled rapper found himself back behind bars after violating the terms of his house arrest
Yeah

[Verse 1]
You know I'm a hot boy, but I ain't never lose my cool
The streets on fire, that's why I'm ridin' with my tool
1800 block boy, I'm quick to give a bitch the blues
I was already sentenced, before I came up out the womb
Streets done already sentenced me, before no cracker could
And I wonder why, when I'm just so fucked up out the hood
And I wonder why, these niggas be hatin' on a G
When I'm the same lil' nigga, who gave you niggas a chance to eat
I had to do that time, could nobody do that shit for me
When I was doin' that time, ain't nobody do that shit with me
I miss my nigga Cool, I know right now he prolly sleep
One day at a time, ten toes down until you're free

[Chorus]
Dyin' in a cell's every street nigga fear
I give everythin' back to have my nigga here
I give everythin' back to have my nigga with me
I already know I had to beef, had my nigga with me
I ain't tryna see the pen', I'm tryna make a shape
Neighborhood hero, I'm the one gon' save the day
Chosen one, my folks depend on me to make a way
I do it for my nigga locked up doin' day for day

[Verse 2]
They gave Lil' Marcus twenty-five, that's my man (ayy)
Remember hittin' licks and runnin' up them bands (ayy, ayy)
They gave Lil' Greg sixteen years in the pen (ayy)
For all my niggas locked up, I'm goin' H.A.M. (ayy, ayy)
They gave Lil' Ceelo twenty years, free my nigga
They say Lil' Tracy gettin' out this December
I dropped fifty-five bands from my hand
They done let me out, so now I'm goin' in
Before he go back, shoot it out with the police (ayy)
So that mean he goin' to court in these streets (ayy, ayy)
He goin' to trial right there where he stands (ayy)
For everybody did me wrong, I want revenge (ayy, ayy)

[Chorus]
Dyin' in a cell's every street nigga fear
I give everythin' back to have my nigga here
I give everythin' back to have my nigga with me
I already know I had to beef,  had my nigga with me
I ain't tryna see the pen', I'm tryna make a shape
Neighborhood hero, I'm the one gon' save the day
Chosen one, my folks depend on me to make a way
I do it for my nigga locked up doin' day for day

[Outro]
This my motherfuckin' album
Paintin' pictures man, lil' Kodak, you already know that

[Intro]
Who that is? Lil Kodak
It's Gucci!
1800!
Look!

[Verse 1: Kodak Black]
Cuban on my wrist, Cuban on my neck, your girl on X
Money talks, she on the phone line, we havin' phone sex
Never duckin' from you peons, I ain't fold yet
Kept it real since the begun, I ain't told yet
I done finally got my muscle up, you know I'm gon' flex
People rootin' for the hustler, I think I'm on next
At your neck, I don't get tired, I ain't gon' rest
You gotta play your cards right, them jack boys on deck
I gotta keep the fan on, you know them girls gon' sweat
I'm tryna put my man on, but he ain't came home yet
Kodak Black but my hoe red, she get her own bread
I hit your girl with the pole, now she walkin' bowlegged
Dirty drink this that prometh, ain't sippin' Mo't
I'm just tryna stay focused, ain't tryna go flat
You turn cold when the heater on, I know you're gon' melt
I've been smokin' broccoli, they say it's good for your health
Nah I'm good, I don't need your help, I do it myself
I know you don't really love me, you're just lovin' my wealth
It's lil Kodak, the finesse kid, walkin' like a lick
Hittin' licks, now I'm droppin' hits, mouthpiece cost a brick

[Chorus: Kodak Black]
In the club, boppin' in this bih, vibin' with my clique
All she wanted was to take a pic, but now she gettin' hit
In the club, poppin' in this bih, vibin' with my clique
Poppin' in this bih, vibin' with my clique
In the club, boppin' in this bih, bibin' with my clique
All she wanted was to take a pic, but now she gettin' hit
In the club, boppin' in this bih, vibin' with my clique
Poppin' in this bih, vibin' with my clique

[Verse 2: Gucci Mane]
Lock me in a box, but I'm comin' out swingin'
Watch 200 so I'm comin' out blingin'
Somethin' like the wind, can't touch, just hear me
Suckas can't see me, but they damn sure feel me
They say, "Gucci Mane gone, the rap game ain't nothin'"
Soon as he left, the coke price start jumpin'
Walk around the club like I walked around the yard
Nigga I'm the trap god, you tryna look hard
I'll never ever ever ask the police to protect me
Never ever ever let a rapper disrespect me
Next up from Gucci Mane, gun clappin' gon' happen
Put a cap to the captain, see my bullets tap dancin'
Guwop!

[Chorus: Kodak Black]
In the club, boppin' in this bih, vibin' with my clique
All she wanted was to take a pic, but now she gettin' hit
In the club, poppin' in this bih, vibin' with my clique
Poppin' in this bih, vibin' with my clique
In the club, boppin' in this bih, bibin' with my clique
All she wanted was to take a pic, but now she gettin' hit
In the club, boppin' in this bih, vibin' with my clique
Poppin' in this bih, vibin' with my clique

[Intro: Kodak Black]
Ayy, Sniper Gang
Rah, rah! Slay a nigga!
You know I'm slangin' cash
Sniper Gang
Rah, rah! Kill nigga!

[Verse 1: Kodak Black]
My nigga slayed a nigga, I just came from hanging with him
I don't know what really happened, I think he home invade the nigga
You never catch me out here clubbing unless they paid a nigga
Why the fuck I chase a bitch when I don't even chase the liquor
Hell yeah they call me Kodak but I ain't come to take no picture
So icy, make it blizzard, and I'm leaning sippin sizzurp
Lil Wiz, still be kicking doors, I call that boy a wizard
Damn, I was textin' drivin', I looked up, I wrecked the fender
Wally say boy you better get her so I blitzed her
No time to waste, therefore if I get her I'ma hit her
My mama say, baby you a winner not a quitter
Well not today, 'cause mama soon as I hit her I'ma quit her
Cut the top with a scissor, turned my new car to a vert
I might need a new liver 'cause my body full of syrup
Kodak Black, but I'm smoking purp, thinkin' 'bout cheesy purp
Rest in peace, Wayne Head and Purp, them boys down to earth
She know I'm a beast at every angle, you can call me Kurt
Flipped her over by her ankles, locked her and she called me Kurt
She know I be getting to the paper, I be putting in work
Up the road, playing with the papers, yeah I got that work

[Hook: Kodak Black]
I'm on that greedy shit, that fiendin' shit, I need a piece
I'm on that wreckless shit, that selfish shit, I'm playing for keeps
Money hungry, I can't spare bitch, I gotta eat
I keep that heavy metal just in case he tryna creep
I'm on that schemin' shit, you better give me everything
I'm on that Demon shit, the devil know I keep that heat
You remind me of your bitch, I got you on your knees
Jeep Cherokee, I'm skiing with my dope boy wrist

[Verse 2: Boosie Badazz]
Take his bag then smash, what uncle telling me
Dirty pistol, dirty mask, another felony
Rocks in my mouth, I spit 'em out when I was sellin' weed
Choppers was tryna take me out at only seventeen
9 Glock, body rock, this bitch hold 17
Mouth wet, pussy hot, she just was 17 (too young for me)
Cocaine under my nails, working this triple beam
No fingerprints on my shells, too sticky from the lean
I'm on that greedy shit, it's mine, I ain't gon' feed a bitch
Leave you leaking quick, one shot, one kill, Desert Eagle shit
I really got it out the mud, this ain't no freebie shit
Guess how I got all my muscle, from deleting shit
Hard on the pussy, no old lady, I just borrow the pussy
These niggas thugging for the gram, gon' record the pussy
Boy you remind me of your bitch, you a bitch
Your address supposed to be a nigga's ditch
Old pussy ass nigga

[Hook: Kodak Black]
I'm on that greedy shit, that fiendin' shit, I need a piece
I'm on that wreckless shit, that selfish shit, I'm playing for keeps
Money hungry, I can't smell bitch, I gotta eat
I keep that heavy metal just in case he tryna creep
I'm on that schemin' shit, you better give me everything
I'm on that Demon shit, the devil know I keep that heat
You remind me of your bitch, I got you on your knees
Jeep Cherokee, I'm skiing with my dope boy wrist

Yeah, yeah
Young, young, young Gunna, yeah
Run that back, Turbo
Baby

[Chorus: Gunna]
Sold out dates, cash every day
I got you Herm's, I light up Blu-rays
This cheetah my pet, the condo a cage
Addicted to sex, I gotta get laid
My jacket Off-White, don't mean that it's beige
I clean up real nice, I don't got a maid
An ape in the night, I'm still rockin' Bape
Live on paradise, I don't see the shade

[Verse 1: Gunna]
'Nother backend, I'm back on the road
Flooded Patek, paid off a show
Drippin' is rare, more this Vlone
Hoes by the pair, I'm never alone
Sleep on the Lear, Comme des Gar'ons
Drop eight in a two and let it dissolve
Balmain my denim, young Gun wanna ball
Rock the whole concert and hopped in a frog
My foreign's a toy, I'm still a kid
10K this year for Coachella, it's lit
Bro got umbrellas to cover her wig
Open Ceremony, left them in a trench
Lightning bolt diamonds 'cause I want revenge
We straight like a line, man, I really got rich
Some more fancy yellow diamonds in my piss
Don't get it confused, I'm still bangin' the six
New Cartier, Gunna a don
Niggas tryna soak up the drip like a sponge
Hatred's contagious, I keep me a gun
I'm focused on makin' a M in a month
Baby order twenty thousand in ones
Walk in and buy, I'm not asking how much
Red on the bottom, you need to catch up
Consistently droppin', I need me a dub

[Chorus: Gunna]
Sold out dates, cash every day
I got you Herm's, I light up Blu-rays
This cheetah my pet, the condo a cage
Addicted to sex, I gotta get laid
My jacket Off-White, don't mean that it's beige
I clean up real nice, I don't got a maid
An ape in the night, I'm still rockin' Bape
Live on paradise, I don't see the shade

[Verse 2: Lil Baby]
Me and young Gunna back at it again
We just left New York, double datin' with twins
I just bought a Wraith, I retired the Benz
I fired my bitch and I hired her friend
I see all the hate through these Cartier lens
Every two months tryna put up an M
My dog caught a body, they got it on film
He still rockin' Gucci watches in the pen
Take a trip 'round the globe then we do it again
Got 'em watchin' my drip, guess I'm settin' the trend
Louis backpack, hit the jet and I'm gone
I don't post what I do 'cause these niggas be clones
See these diamonds they hittin', these VVS stones
Got a championship ring, I just brought it home
FN is plastic, them bullets like pellets
This Givenchy jacket, this ain't Pelle Pelle
Sold out dates, you know I don't play
The last eight months straight, got no time for breaks
On they neck 'til it breaks, ain't pushin' no brakes
I got on two watches, I still come in late
It feel like my birthday, I'm gettin' this cake
I pop like I got it, I'm holdin' my weight
I control the projects, I'm pushin' this weight
I'm sippin' this sizzurp, I poured me an eight

[Chorus: Gunna]
Sold out dates, cash every day
I got you Herm's, I light up Blu-rays
This cheetah my pet, the condo a cage
Addicted to sex, I gotta get laid

I clean up real nice, I don't got a maid
An ape in the night, I'm still rockin' Bape
Live on paradise, I don't see the shade

Bought some exclusive drip on Melrose
Fuck the judge, gave my cousin elbow
Locked him up, put him in a hellhole
They hope that he rotting out in mildew
Ain't seen him since my first year of high school

If she sell pussy better have some bond nigga
Hit you up high, you leaping like a frog (Frog)

Bought myself a ladder, I'ma stack it tall (Tall)

Copped the new Lam' and put it on land
These fuck niggas mad, I see it in they face
The jet that I'm on, it's sponsored by Wraith

Pick and chose who the right one to trust
Pick and chose who the right one to trust
Keep it real it's a lot fake love

New agenda, don't do nothin' free
Ain't not one of my foreigns on E
All my bitches got expensive weave
I sip drank for my pain to get eased
I still talk to the Lord on my knees
Helpin' me take care all of my needs
And we take off the top for a breeze

[Chorus]
Who you think you foolin'? We not new to it

Crib come with a gym and a mini-golf course (Golf course)
Hittin' it off of the slam, and ball in the rim when I score
Smoke a lot of grams, you would've thought I knew a grower
Sip more than an ounce, I never imagined what I'd pour
Don't know the amount

[Chorus]
I'm out the hood, but I'm hood melodic
I smoke good narcotics, keep my diamonds polished
Throw a dime in Onyx, keep them dollars coming
Look at all this money, this is our summer
I'm out the hood, but I'm still a hood baby
Yeah, I'm still going crazy, make these labels pay me
Bought a new Mercedes, I come from where it get crazy
I'm chasing this paper daily, fuck these niggas who hate me

[Chorus]
I'm out the hood, but I'm hood melodic
I smoke good narcotics, keep my diamonds polished
Throw a dime in Onyx, keep them dollars coming
Look at all this money, this is our summer
I'm out the hood, but I'm still a hood baby
Yeah, I'm still going crazy, make these labels pay me
Bought a new Mercedes, I come from where it get crazy
I'm chasing this paper daily, fuck these niggas who hate me

Run that back, Turbo

[Chorus]
Feel like I'm sittin' on a mountain, VVS
All this water on me look like a fountain (Fountain, fountain)
Backend racks in, I need an accountant (Yuh), Cartier
He told me I don't need the vouchers (Vouchers)
Keep the Hi-Tech seals in the couches
Landed in LA, 3 hours, smoked me three whole ounces (Yuh, yuh)
Pulled up in the same state, performin' in different counties (Yuh)
Four rings on my fingers, eight hours in my Audi (Ayy)

[Verse 1]
That's on everything, everything, yeah
Walk in the mall buy everything
Everyday I change, Chanel strings
Play no games, Alexander Wang on her nail paint
Your drip insane, where the fuck my paint? Stop playin' games
Watch your range, my nut deranged, they actin' ways
Go get paid, the condo late, that Frito Lay (Lay)
Family straight, don't see no shade, the Dolce way
My new-new babe loves lemonade, like Beyonc'
We the wave, ahh, flyin' out of PDK (PDK)
Smashin' in the Lamb I barely use the brakes (Use the brakes)
I'm in New Orleans on my birthday, I got Beaucoup cake (Beaucoup cake)
Gon' have to man that sail little harder for you to feel the lake

Feel like I'm sittin' on a mountain, VVS
All this water on me look like a fountain (Fountain, fountain)

[Verse 1]
First things first: rest in peace Uncle Phil
For real, you the only father that I ever knew
I get my bitch pregnant, I'ma be a better you
Prophecies that I made way back in the Ville, fulfilled
Listen, even back when we was broke, my team ill
Martin Luther King woulda been on Dreamville
Talk to a nigga

[Pre-Chorus]
One time for my L.A. sisters
One time for my L.A. hoes
Lame niggas can't tell the difference
One time for a nigga who know

[Chorus]
Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved
Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved
Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved
Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved

[Verse 2]
No role models and I'm here right now
No role models to speak of
Searchin' through my memory, my memory, I couldn't find one
Last night I was gettin' my feet rubbed
By the baddest bitch, not Trina but I swear to God
This bitch'll make you call your girl up
And tell her, "Hey, what's good?"
"Sorry I'm never comin' home, I'ma stay for good."
Then hang the phone up and proceed to lay the wood
I came fast like 9-1-1 in white neighborhoods
Ain't got no shame 'bout it
She think I'm spoiled and I'm rich 'cause I can have any bitch
I got defensive and said, "Nah, I was the same without it."
But then I thought back, back to a better me
Before I was a B-list celebrity
Before I started callin' bitches "bitches" so heavily
Back when you could get a platinum plaque without no melody
You wasn't sweatin' me

[Pre-Chorus]
One time for my L.A. sisters
One time for my L.A. hoes
Lame niggas can't tell the difference
One time for a nigga who know

[Chorus]
Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved
Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved
Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved
Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved

[Verse 3]
I want a real love, dark skinned Aunt Viv love
That Jada and that Will love
That leave a toothbrush at your crib love
And you ain't gotta wonder whether that's your kid love
Nigga, I don't want no bitch from reality shows
Out-of-touch-with-reality hoes
Out in Hollywood bringin' back five or six hoes
Fuck 'em then we kick 'em to the do'
Nigga, you know how it go
She deserved that, she a bird, it's a bird trap
You think if I didn't rap she would flirt back?
Takin' off her skirt, let her wear my shirt 'fore she leave
I'ma need my shirt back (Nigga, you know how it go)

[Pre-Chorus]
One time for my L.A. sisters
One time for my L.A. hoes
Lame niggas can't tell the difference
One time for a nigga who know

[Chorus]
Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved
Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved
Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved
Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved

[Interlude: George W. Bush]
There's an old saying in Tennessee'I know it's in Texas, probably in Tennessee'that says, fool me once' shame on''shame on you. Fool me, you can't get fooled again

[Bridge]
Fool me one time, shame on you
Fool me twice, can't put the blame on you
Fool me three times, fuck the peace sign
Load the chopper, let it rain on you
Fool me one time, shame on you
Fool me twice, can't put the blame on you
Fool me three times, fuck the peace sign
Load the chopper, let it rain on you

[Verse 4]
My only regret was too young for Lisa Bonet
My only regret was too young for Nia Long
Now all I'm left with is hoes from reality shows
Hand her a script, the bitch probably couldn't read along
My only regret was too young for Sade Adu
My only regret, could never take Aaliyah home
Now all I'm left with is hoes up in Greystone
With the stale face 'cause they know it's they song
She shallow but the pussy deep (she shallow, she shallow)
She shallow but the pussy deep (she shallow, she shallow)
She shallow but the pussy deep (she shallow, she shallow)
She shallow but the pussy deep (she shallow, she shallow)

[Chorus]
Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved
Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved
Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved
Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved
Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved
Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved
Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved
Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved

[Chorus 1: J. Cole]
Got me up all night
All I'm singin' is love songs
She got me up all night
Constant drinkin' and love songs
She got me up all night
Down-and-out with these love songs
She got me up all night
Drownin' out with these love songs
She got me up all night (Yeah)
All I'm singin' is love songs
She got me up all night (Yeah)
Constant drinkin' and love songs
She got me up all night (Yeah)
Down-and-out with these love songs
She got me open all night (Uh-huh)
Got me open all night, hey

[Verse 1: J. Cole]
Okay, back when I was sleeping in my mama crib
Or even back when I was up there in Mohammed crib
Paying seventeen-hundred for the rent, money well-spent
No heater, but a nigga made heat, may I vent?
Had a thing for ya, even wrote the song "Dreams" for ya
'Cause I had dreams for ya, thoughts of a ring for ya
Childish shit, you know child and shit
Anonymous flowers sent, you know coward shit
Now a nigga signed to Hov, took a power trip
Back home, I'm grown now, and the city's my throne now, huh
The same clubs that I used to get tossed out
Life got Kriss Kross'd: totally crossed out
'Cause now I'm in this bitch and I'm totally bossed out
Old chicks crying 'cause they know that they lost out
But I'm still on you, I'm still on you
My drink spill on me, while I feel on you, I'm sayin''

[Pre-Chorus: Miguel]
Would you believe me if I said I'm in love?
Baby, I want you to want me
Would you believe me if I said I'm in love?
Baby, I want ya

[Chorus 2: J. Cole]
And we are, we are, we are
Got me up all night
And we are, we are, we are
All I'm singin' is love songs
And we are, we are, we are
Got me up all night
And we are, we are, we are (She got me)
And we are, we are, we are (She got me)

[Verse 2: J. Cole]
Well, this has got to be the longest crush ever
If I ever get to fuck it'd be the longest bust ever
Love is a drug, like the strongest stuff ever and
Fuck it, I'm on one, you feel me?
She on a power trip, she got me where she want a nigga
Wife'ing in the club, man, my homies gon' disown a nigga
Like, "Give me twenty dollars, dollars!"
Ass stupid, how you get to college, college?
I'm in your city and I'm wonderin' if you're home now
Went and found a man, but I'm hopin' you're alone now
Can't help but feeling like I dropped the ball, clich'
I used to pop up on you at the mall each day
Now, typically I kick game like East Bay
But you got a nigga freeze-framed yelling: "Please play!"
For Pete's sake, homie, pull it together
Just fuck her one time and be through with forever, but'

[Pre-Chorus: Miguel]
Would you believe me if I said I'm in love?
Baby, I want you to want me
Would you believe me if I said I'm in love?
Baby, I want ya, yeah

[Chorus 2: J. Cole]
And we are, we are, we are
Got me up all night
And we are, we are, we are
All I'm singin' is love songs
And we are, we are, we are
Got me up all night
And we are, we are, we are (She got me)
And we are, we are, we are (She got me)

[Chorus 1: J. Cole]
Got me up all night (All night)
All I'm singin' is love songs
She got me up all night (All night)
Constant drinkin' and love songs
She got me up all night (All night)
Down-and-out with these love songs
She got me up all night (All night)
Drownin' out with these love songs
She got me up all night (Yeah)
All I'm singin' is love songs
She got me up all night (Yeah)
Constant drinkin' and love songs
She got me up all night (Yeah)
Down-and-out with these love songs
She got me open all night (Uh-huh)
Got me open all night, hey

Back when I was sleeping in my mama crib

[Intro]
Cole, Cole world, yeah
Let me take y'all back, man
As I do so well
Wasn't nothin' like that

[Verse 1]
Man, it wasn't nothin' like that first time, she was in my math class
Long hair, brown skin with a fat ass
Sat beside me, used to laugh, had mad jokes
The teacher always got mad so we passed notes
It started off so innocent
She had a vibe and a nigga started diggin' it
I was a youngin, straight crushin', tryna play the shit cool
But a nigga couldn't wait to get to school
'Cause when I seen them thighs on her
And them hips on her and them lips on her
Got me daydreamin', man, what
I'm thinkin' how she rides on it, if she sits on it, if she licks on it
Make it hard for me to stand up
As time goes by, attractions gettin' deep and
Wet dreamin', thinkin' that I'm smashin' but I'm sleepin'
I want it bad, and I ain't never been obsessed before
She wrote a note that said, "You ever had sex before?"
Damn'

[Chorus]
And I ain't never did this before, no
And I ain't never did this before, no
And I ain't never did this before, no
And I ain't never did this before, no
And I ain't never did this before, nooo
I ain't never did this before, no
And I ain't never did this before, no
And I ain't never did this before, no

[Verse 2]
I wrote back and said
"Of course I had sex before," knowin' I was frontin'
I said, "I'm like a pro, baby," knowin' I was stuntin'
But if I told the truth, I knew that I'd get played out, son
Hadn't been in pussy since the day I came out one
But she don't know that, so she done wrote back and told me
"Oh, you a pro, homie? Well, I want you to show me
My mama gone for the weekend
So Saturday, baby, we can get to freakin'."
That's when my heart start racin' and my body start sweatin'
Baby, you done woke my lil' man up
I'm thinkin' how that body look naked when you layin' on the bed
Teacher, please, don't make me stand up
I wrote back like, "Yeah, baby, sound like a plan."
Still tryna play it cool, sound like the man
But I was scared to death, my nigga, my stomach turnin'
Talkin' shit, knowin' damn well I was a virgin
Fuck'

[Chorus]
And I ain't never did this before, no
And I ain't never did this before, no
And I ain't never did this before, no
And I ain't never did this before, no
And I ain't never did this before, nooo
I ain't never did this before, no
And I ain't never did this before, no
And I ain't never did this before, no

[Verse 3]
You know that feelin' when you know
You finna bone for the first time?
I'm hopin' that she won't notice it's my first time
I'm hopin' that my shit is big enough to fuck with
And most of all I'm prayin', "God, don't let me bust quick!"
I'm watchin' pornos, tryna see just how to stroke right
Practice puttin' condoms on'how it go, right?
I'm in her crib, now a nigga palms sweatin'
With a pocket full of rubbers and an erection
That's when my hands start touchin'
And her face start blushin' and a nigga roll over on top
And then she get my pants unbuckled
And her hands start rubbin' on me, ooh girl, don't stop
It's time for action
Pull out the condoms real smooth, yeah, just how I practiced
But right before I put it in, she flinched and grabbed it
And said, "I wanna get somethin' off my mental
I can tell you're a pro, but baby, be gentle, 'cause'"

[Chorus]
'Cause I ain't never did this before, no
And I ain't never did this before, no
And I ain't never did this before, no
And I ain't never did this before, no
And I ain't never did this before, nooo
I ain't never did this before, no
And I ain't never did this before, no
And I ain't never did this before, no

[Chorus: T-Boz, Chilli & Jennifer Hudson]
Even though I'
On my way, on my way, on my way down
On my way, on my way, on my way down
You were the one that was tryna keep me way down
But like the sun, know you know I find my way back round

[Verse 1: J. Cole]
They tell me I should fix my grill 'cause I got money now
I ain't gon' sit around and front like I ain't thought about it
A perfect smile is more appealing, but it's funny how
My shit is crooked'look at how far I done got without it!
I keep my twisted grill, just to show the kids it's real
We ain't picture perfect, but we worth the picture still
I got smart, I got rich and I got bitches still
And they all look like my eyebrows: thick as hell
Love yourself, girl, or nobody will
Though you a woman I don't know how you deal
With all the pressure to look impressive and go out in heels
I feel for you, killin' yourself to find a man that'll kill for you
You wake up, put makeup on
Stare in the mirror, but it's clear that you can't face what's wrong
No need to fix what God already put his paintbrush on
Your roommate yelling, "Why you gotta take so long?!"
What it's like to have a crooked smile

[Chorus: T-Boz, Chilli & Jennifer Hudson (J. Cole)]
Even though I'
On my way, on my way, on my way down
On my way, on my way, on my way down (This crooked smile)
You were the one that was tryna keep me way down
But like the sun, know you know I find my way back round (Yeah)

[Verse 2: J. Cole]
To all the women with the flaws, know it's hard, my darling
You wonder why you're lonely and your man's not calling
You keep falling victim 'cause you're insecure
And when I tell you that you're beautiful you can't be sure
'Cause he don't seem to want you back and it's got you askin'
So all you see is what you lackin', not what you packin'
Take it from a man that loves what you got
And baby girl, you a star, don't let 'em tell you you're not
Now is it real? Eyebrows, fingernails, hair
Is it real? If it's not, girl, you don't care
'Cause what's real is somethin' that the eyes can't see
That the hands can't touch, that them broads can't be
And that's you, never let 'em see your frown
And if you need a friend to pick you up, I'll be around
And we can ride with the windows down, the music loud
I can tell you ain't laughed in a while
But I wanna see that crooked smile

[Chorus: T-Boz, Chilli & Jennifer Hudson]
Even though I'
On my way, on my way, on my way down
On my way, on my way, on my way down
You were the one that was tryna keep me way down
But like the sun, know you know I find my way back round

[Post-Chorus: J. Cole T-Boz & Chilli]
We got the crooked smile, we can style on 'em
Back round, crooked smile, we can style on 'em
You were the one that was tryna keep me way down
But like the sun, know you know I find my way back round

[Verse 3: J. Cole]
We don't look nothin' like the people on the screen
You know, the movie stars, picture perfect beauty queens
But we got dreams and we got the right to chase 'em
Look at the nation
That's a crooked smile braces couldn't even straighten
Seem like half the race is either on probation or in jail
Wonder why we inhale, 'cause we in Hell already
I ask: If my skin pale, would I then sell like Eminem or Adele?
But one more time for the 'Ville
And fuck all of that beef shit, nigga, let's make a mil
Hey officer man, we don't want nobody gettin' killed
Just open up that cell, let my brother outta jail
I got money for the bail now, and well now
If you askin' will I tell now'ayy, hell nah
I ain't snitchin' 'cause, man, they get them niggas stitches now
If you was around then you wouldn't need a witness now
How you like this crooked smile?

[Chorus: T-Boz, Chilli & Jennifer Hudson (J. Cole)]
Even though I'
On my way, on my way, on my way down
On my way, on my way, on my way down (That crooked smile)
You were the one that was tryna keep me way down
But like the sun, know you know I find my way back round

[Post-Chorus: J. Cole T-Boz & Chilli]
We got the crooked smile, we can style on 'em
Back round, crooked smile, we can style on 'em
You were the one that was tryna keep me way down
But like the sun, know you know I find my way back round

On my way, on my way, on my way down
On my way, on my way, on my way down
You were the one that was tryna keep me way down
But like the sun, know you know I find my way back round
Back round
You were the one that was tryna keep me way down
But like the sun, know you know I find my way back round
Back round
You were the one that was tryna keep me way down
But like the sun, know you know I find my way back round

[Intro]
Huh, ayy, put a finger in the sky if you want it, nigga
Ayy, put two fingers in the sky if you want her
Ayy, put a finger in the sky if you want it, nigga
Ayy, put two fingers in the sky if you want her
Ayy, put a finger in the sky if you want it, nigga
Ayy, put two fingers in the sky if you want her
Ayy, put a finger in the sky if you want it, nigga
Ayy, put two fingers in the sky if you want her

[Verse 1]
Sometimes you worry 'bout the things he can provide for ya
Whenever you around I seem to come alive for ya
I finally recognize the feelings that's inside for ya
Although I know your man and trust me he would die for ya
These quiet thoughts of you been going on for years now
I saw you in the party, soft lips, soft spoken
I came and talked to you but homie interfered now
He introduced you as his girl and I was heartbroken
Some people talk about that love at first sight shit
To keep it real I don't know whether I believe it's true
But if it is then tell me if I'm wrong or right
If I fell in love with you before I ever even knew
I catch your eye then look away as if it never happened
At times I feel as though I'm caught up in a strange dream
If eyes could talk then mines would tell ya that I'm feeling you
Sometimes I swear your eyes be telling me the same thing

[Pre-Chorus]
She fuck with small town niggas, I got bigger dreams
She fuck with small town niggas, I got bigger dreams (listen)
She fuck with small town niggas, I got bigger dreams
She fuck with small town niggas, I got bigger dreams (listen)

[Chorus]
Club jumping, don't stop, off top
But you know we only go 'til 2 o'clock
Put yo motherfuckin' hood up, it's the weekend
Drop that, back that ass up and bitches get to freaking
Last call at the bar, ladies get a drink, nigga get some balls
Ain't no telling you gonna see that bitch tomorrow
Stop holding up the wall waiting for the right song
Better holla cause you know they bout to cut the lights on

[Verse 2]
And put my number in it'
I'm staring at you from afar, I'm wondering 'bout you
Like, where you from and who you are?
'Cause you a star'no, not the type that snort the white lines
I mean the type to light the night time, I heard you got a man
But who in their right mind letting you out the house alone?
Tell me is your house a home?
Why you in the club looking like you out your zone?
Now be discreet and pull out your phone and put my number in it
Text a nigga when your man leave you unattended
On a scale from 1 to 10 that girl's a hundred and I want it
No question, I know destiny well
And though I sin the Lord blessing me still
Every saint got a past, every sinner got a future
Every loser gotta win and every winner gotta lose someday
They say it's just a matter of time
And if I had my way then you would be mine

[Pre-Chorus]
She fuck with small town niggas, I got bigger dreams
She fuck with small town niggas, I got bigger dreams (listen)
She fuck with small town niggas, I got bigger dreams
She fuck with small town niggas, I got bigger dreams

[Chorus]
Club jumping, don't stop, off top
But you know we only go 'til 2 o'clock
Put yo motherfuckin' hood up, it's the weekend
Drop that, back that ass up and bitches get to freaking
Last call at the bar, ladies get a drink, nigga get some balls
Ain't no telling you gonna see that bitch tomorrow
Stop holding up the wall waiting for the right song
Better holla 'cause you know they bout to cut the lights on

[Bridge]
I know you were made for me but
Darling don't you wait for me
'Cause I can see the promised land
But I can't do no promising
I know you were made for me but
Darling don't you wait for me
'Cause I can see the promised land
But I can't do no promising

[Outro]
Ayy, put a finger in the sky if you want it, nigga
Ayy, put two fingers in the sky if you want her
Ayy, put a finger in the sky if you want it, nigga
Ayy, put two fingers in the sky if you want her
Ayy, put a finger in the sky if you want it, nigga
Ayy, put two fingers in the sky if you want her
Ayy, put a finger in the sky if you want it, nigga
Ayy, put two fingers in the sky if you want her

[Intro]
You good, T-Minus?

[Refrain]
Niggas been countin' me out
I'm countin' my bullets, I'm loadin' my clips
I'm writin' down names, I'm makin' a list
I'm checkin' it twice and I'm gettin' 'em hit
The real ones been dyin', the fake ones is lit
The game is off balance, I'm back on my shit
The Bentley is dirty, my sneakers is dirty
But that's how I like it, you all on my dick

[Verse 1]
I'm all in my bag, this hard as it get
I do not snort powder, I might take a sip
I might hit the blunt, but I'm liable to trip
I ain't poppin' no pill, but you do as you wish
I roll with some fiends, I love 'em to death
I got a few mil' but not all of them rich
What good is the bread if my niggas is broke?
What good is first class if my niggas can't sit?
That's my next mission, that's why I can't quit
Just like LeBron, get my niggas more chips
Just put the Rollie right back on my wrist
This watch came from Drizzy, he gave me a gift
Back when the rap game was prayin' I'd diss
They act like two legends cannot coexist
But I'd never beef with a nigga for nothin'
If I smoke a rapper, it's gon' be legit
It won't be for clout, it won't be for fame
It won't be 'cause my shit ain't sellin' the same
It won't be to sell you my latest lil' sneakers
It won't be 'cause some nigga slid in my lane
Everything grows, it's destined to change
I love you lil' niggas, I'm glad that you came
I hope that you scrape every dollar you can
I hope you know money won't erase the pain
To the OGs, I'm thankin' you now
Was watchin' you when you was pavin' the ground
I copied your cadence, I mirrored your style
I studied the greats, I'm the greatest right now
Fuck if you feel me, you ain't got a choice
Now I ain't do no promo, still made all that noise
This year gon' be different, I set my intentions
I promise to slap all that hate out your voice

[Refrain]
Niggas been countin' me out
I'm countin' my bullets, I'm loadin' my clips
I'm writin' down names, I'm makin' a list
I'm checkin' it twice and I'm gettin' 'em hit
The real ones been dyin', the fake ones is lit
The game is off balance, I'm back on my shit
The Bentley is dirty, my sneakers is dirty
But that's how I like it, you all on my dick

[Chorus]
I just poured somethin' in my cup
I've been wantin' somethin' I can feel
Promise I am never lettin' up
Money in your palm don't make you real
Foot is on they neck, I got 'em stuck
I'ma give 'em somethin' they can feel
If it ain't 'bout the squad, don't give a fuck
Pistol in your hand don't make you real

[Verse 2]
I'm dead in the middle of two generations
I'm little bro and big bro all at once
Just left the lab with young 21 Savage
I'm 'bout to go and meet Jigga for lunch
Had a long talk with the young nigga Kodak
Reminded me of young niggas from 'Ville
Straight out the projects, no fakin', just honest
I wish that he had more guidance, for real
Too many niggas in cycle of jail
Spending they birthdays inside of a cell
We coming from a long bloodline of trauma
We raised by our mamas, Lord, we gotta heal
We hurting our sisters, the babies as well
We killing our brothers, they poisoned the well
Distorted self-image, we set up to fail
I'ma make sure that the real gon' prevail, nigga

[Chorus]
I just poured somethin' in my cup
I've been wantin' somethin' I can feel
Promise I am never lettin' up
Money in your palm don't make you real
Foot is on they neck, I got 'em stuck
I'ma give 'em somethin' they can feel
If it ain't 'bout the squad, don't give a fuck
Pistol in your hand don't make you real

[Outro]
Money in your palm don't make you real
Pistol in your hand don't make you real
Money in your palm don't make you real

[Intro]
Love yours
Love yours
No such thing

[Chorus]
No such thing as a life that's better than yours
No such thing as a life that's better than yours (Love yours)
No such thing as a life that's better than yours
No such thing, no such thing

[Refrain]
Heart beatin' fast, let a nigga know that he alive
Fake niggas, mad snakes
Snakes in the grass let a nigga know that he arrived
Don't be sleepin' on your level
'Cause it's beauty in the struggle, nigga (Beauty, beauty)
Goes for all y'all
It's beauty in the struggle, nigga (Beauty, beauty)
Let me explain, yeah

[Verse 1]
It's beauty in the struggle, ugliness in the success
Hear my words or listen to my signal of distress
I grew up in the city and know sometimes we had less
Compared to some of my niggas
Down the block, man, we were blessed
And life can't be no fairytale, no once upon a time
But I be goddamned if a nigga don't be tryin'
So tell me, Momma please, why you be drinkin' all the time?
Does all the pain he brought you still linger in your mind?
'Cause pain still lingers on mine
On the road to riches, listen, this is what you'll find
The good news is, nigga, you came a long way
The bad news is, nigga, you went the wrong way
Think being broke was better

[Chorus]
No such thing as a life that's better than yours
No such thing as a life that's better than yours
(think being broke was better)
No such thing as a life that's better than yours
No such thing, no such thing

[Verse 2]
For what's money without happiness?
Or hard times without the people you love?
Though I'm not sure what's 'bout to happen next
I ask for strength from the Lord up above
'Cause I've been strong so far
But I can feel my grip loosenin'
Quick, do somethin' before you lose it for good
Get it back and use it for good
And touch the people how you did like before
I'm tired of livin' with demons 'cause they always invitin' more
Think being broke was better
Now I don't mean that phrase with no disrespect
To all my niggas out there livin' in debt
Cashin' minimal checks, turn on the TV see a nigga Rolex
And fantasize about a life with no stress
I mean this shit sincerely
And as a nigga who was once in your shoes
Livin' with nothin' to lose, I hope one day you hear me
Always gon' be a bigger house somewhere, but nigga feel me
Long as the people in that motherfucker love you dearly
Always gon' be a whip that's better than the one you got
Always gon' be some clothes that's fresher than the ones you rock
Always gon' be a bitch that's badder out there on the tours
But you ain't never gon' be happy 'til you love yours

[Chorus]
No such thing as a life that's better than yours (Love yours)
No such thing as a life that's better than yours (Love yours)
No such thing as a life that's better than yours (Love yours)
No such thing, no such thing

[Refrain]
Heart beatin' fast, let a nigga know that he alive
Fake niggas, mad snakes
Snakes in the grass let a nigga know that he arrived

[Intro]
Hollywood Cole, go
Ay Hollywood, ay Hollywood Cole, go
My nigga done went Hollywood

[Verse 1]
You wanna know just where I'm at, well let me tell you 'bout it
I put my city on the map but let me tell you 'bout it
They tryna say I can't come back, ayy let me tell you 'bout it
Man fuck them niggas I come back, ayy let me tell you 'bout it
I wanna tell you 'bout it: hands up, everybody run
Cole outside and he say he got a gun
Niggas like "Man that's what everybody said"
Go and pop the trunk and everybody dead
Everybody scared of the nigga, aware that the nigga is better
All my bitches the pick of the litter, never bitter
Niggas is fake, they anime
Me I never hate, get cake like Anna Mae, whoa
Eat the cake bitch, eat the damn cake
Fuck good, nigga, we demand great
Order Domino's and she take off all her clothes
Nigga you know how it goes, make the pizza man wait
The best kept secret
Even Hov tried to keep it and I leaked the damn tape
Rest in peace any nigga want beef
Secret service couldn't keep the man safe

[Pre-Chorus]
I said to the window, to the wall
My nigga ride when I call
Got bitches all in my mind
Fuck nigga blocking my shine
I know the reason you feel the way
I know just who you wan' be
So everyday I thank the man upstairs
That I ain't you and you ain't me

[Chorus]
Get off my dick, whoa
(Get the fuck off my dick)
Get off my dick, whoa
(Get the fuck off my dick nigga)
Get off my dick, bitch, whoa
(Get the fuck off my dick)
Get off my dick, whoa

[Bridge]
Man fuck them niggas I come home and I don't tell nobody
They gettin' temporary dough and I don't tell nobody
Lord will you tell me if I changed, I won't tell nobody
I wanna go back to Jermaine, and I won't tell nobody

[Interlude]
This is the part that the thugs skip!

[Verse 2]
Young nigga never had love
You know, foot massage, back rub shit
Blowing bubbles in the bathtub shit
That is until I met you
Together we done watch years go by
Seen a river of your tears go by
Got me thinkin' bout some kids, still I
Tell them hoes come through (The break up)
Get to know somebody and you really learn a lot about 'em
Won't be long before you start to doubt 'em
Tell yourself you better off without 'em
Then in time you will find can't walk without 'em
Can't talk without 'em, can't breathe without 'em
Came here together, you can't leave without 'em
So you walk back in, make a scene about 'em
On your Amerie it's just 1 thing about 'em
It's called love, niggas don't sing about it no more
Don't nobody sing about it no more, no more
It's called love, niggas don't sing about it no more
Don't nobody sing about it no more
(Nigga I don't sing about this shit no more)
But every nigga in the club singing

[Pre-Chorus]
To the window, to the wall
My nigga ride when I call
Got bitches all in my mind
Fuck nigga blocking my shine
I know the reason you feel the way
I know just who you wan' be
So everyday I thank the man upstairs
That I ain't you and you ain't me

[Bridge]
Get off my dick
But every nigga in the club singing
Singing this song yeah
Got all the bitches in the club singing
Singing this song yeah
And all they mamas let their kids sing it
Sing this song yeah
The baby mamas and the mistresses
Sing this song yeah, song yeah
Song yeah, song song yeah

[Verse 3]
(The make up) This shit is retarded, goddamn
Why every rich black nigga gotta be famous
Why every broke black nigga gotta be brainless
Uh, that's a stereotype
Driven by some people up in Aerial Heights
Here's a scenario
Young Cole pockets is fat like Lil Terrio
Dreamville, give us a year we'll be on every show
Yeah, fuck nigga I'm very sure, heh
Fuck the rest, I'm the best nigga out
When I'm back home I'm the best in the South
When I'm in LA I'm the best in the West
You contest? You can test, I'ma stretch niggas out
Oooh I'ma stretch niggas out
That go for all y'all if I left niggas out
This shit for everybody on my testicles
Please make sure you put the rest in your mouth, ho

[Intro]
Oh right, oh
Oh why na-da-da-da

[Chorus]
I keep my head high
I got my wings to carry me
I don't know freedom
I want my dreams to rescue me
I keep my faith strong
I ask the Lord to follow me
I've been unfaithful
I don't know why you call on me

[Verse 1]
This is my canvas
I'ma paint it how I want it baby, oh I
This is my canvas
I'ma paint it, paint it, paint it, how I want it nigga
Fuck you cause there, there is no right or wrong, only a song
I like to write alone, be in my zone
Think back to Forest Hills, no perfect home
But the only thing like home I've ever known
Until they snatched it from my mama
And foreclosed her on the loan
I'm so sorry that I left you there to deal with that alone
I was up in New York City chasing panties, getting dome
Had no clue what you was going through
How could you be so strong?
And how could I be so selfish, I know I can be so selfish
I could tell by how I treat you with my girl, damn she so selfless
But she put up with my ways because she loves me like you do
And though it don't always show I love her just like I love you
And I need to treat you better
Wish you could live forever
So we could spend more time together
I love you mama

[Chorus]
I keep my head high
I got my wings to carry me
I don't know freedom
I want my dreams to rescue me
I keep my faith strong
I ask the Lord to follow me
I've been unfaithful
I don't know why you call on me

[Post-Chorus]
E-e-eee, e-e, apparently
You believe in me, you believe in me
E-e-eee, e-e, apparently
You believe in me, and I thank you for it, oh I

[Verse 2]
Another day, another rhyme, ho
Another day, another time zone
Today, I woke up feeling horny so it's only right
I got two bitches playing on my trombone
Keep up, never sure where the words would take me
Niggas eat em up, and regurgitate me
Shit trump tight never slurred it lazy
Give a virgin the urge to rape me, nigga please
Best friends really make great for enemies
My watch came, niggas can't wait for one of these
I see you nigga, this ain't no Rolex, it's a AP nigga
I'm hot, dog, catch up to me nigga'uh, couldn't resist
Aim for the stars and I shouldn't have missed
But I was riding on fumes so I stopped by the moon
Now I'm sitting on the hood of this bitch
Like, "Thanks for the view", waiting on thanks from a few
Cause without me you wouldn't exist
You know that shit, gave you the blueprint, don't forget
Cole is your phone on zero percent
Going off, now niggas showing off
Niggas swear they hard but they flowing soft
I'm taking off like "boing!" on a big ass Boeing
Getting head like a coin toss, too easy

[Chorus]
I keep my head high
I got my wings to carry me
I don't know freedom
I want my dreams to rescue me
I keep my faith strong
I ask the Lord to follow me
I've been unfaithful
I don't know why you call on me

[Post-Chorus]
E-e-eee, e-e, apparently
You believe in me, you believe in me
E-e-eee, e-e, apparently
You believe in me, and I thank you for it, oh I

[Pre-Chorus]
She my number one, I don't need nothing on the side
Said that I was done for good and don't want no more lies
But my phone be blowing up, temptations on my line
I stare at the screen a while before I press decline
But she plants a seed and it still lingers in my mind
Told myself I'm strong enough to shake it and I'm trying
But I'm only human, I know loving you's a crime
If I take this cookie now one day I'll do the time

[Chorus]
Slip me a xanny at once (somebody)
I got the earth in a blunt (smoke)
I get the skirt when I want (skrrt!)
I get to skrrt when I want (skrrt!)
Due to the money aroma (somebody)
My girl she got a diploma (smoke)
She got wife written all over
She got wife written all over

[Verse 1]
All a nigga know is how to fuck a good thing up
Run from the pain, sip lean, smoke tree up
When I'm in your town press pound hit me up
When I'm in your town press pound hit me up
Only if you down and you slurp good D up
If the work good I'll be back for the re-up
Hate when I creep and the phone wake me up
Fake like I'm sleep knowing damn well I be up
Monkey on my back and I walk a hundred miles
Guilt make a nigga feel fake when he smile
Love get confused in the mind of a child
'Cause love wouldn't lie like I lie and it's wild
Wanna have my cake and another cake too
Even if the baker don't bake like you
Even when the flavor don't taste like you
So I'm back mobbing with the late night crew
All in your mind with fears that would come true
The back of my mind, the back of my mind was you
Wishing that I could blind myself from view
And only have eyes, and only have eyes for you

[Chorus]
Slip me a xanny at once (somebody)
I got the earth in a blunt (smoke)
I get the skirt when I want (skrrt!)
I get the skirt when I want (skrrt!)
Due to the money aroma (somebody)
My girl she got a diploma (smoke)
She got wife written all over
She got wife written all over

[Bridge]
I'm a fake nigga and it's never been clearer
Can't see myself when I look in the mirror
Can't see myself when I look in the mirror
Can't see myself when I look in the mirror
I'm a fake nigga and it's never been clearer
Can't see myself when I look in the mirror
Can't see myself when I look in the mirror
Can't see myself when I look in the mirror

[Pre-Chorus]
She my number one I don't need nothing on the side
Said that I was done for good and don't want no more lies
But my phone be blowing up, temptations on my line
I stare at the screen a while before I press decline
But she plants a seed and it still lingers in my mind
Told myself I'm strong enough to shake it and I'm trying
But I'm only human, I know loving you's a crime
If I take this cookie now one day I'll do the time

[Verse 2]
I love her, I don't want to lose her
I'm selfish, I know that I use her
My ego get stroked and I bruise her
My ego get stroked and I bruise her
My actions I know they confusin'
At home I look happy as usual
On the road I'm a mack, I'm a chooser
I'm a addict, I'm maskin' that
Kevin's Heart

[Outro]
They tell me "What's done in the dark
Will find a way to shine"
I done did so much that when you see you might go blind
What's done in the dark will always find a way to shine
I done did so much that when you see you might go blind

[Hook]
Nigga why you actin' like a ho?
Know that I'ma ride for ya, either way it go
Tell me, girl why you be stressin' me for time?
When you tell me you love me, can't you see I'm tryna climb?
Damn my nigga why you actin' like a bitch?
If you scared to take a chance, how the fuck we gon' get rich?
Come here baby why you always insecure?
Hold on tight to a nigga and be sure

[Verse 1]
Ain't a way around it no more, I am the greatest
A lotta niggas sat on the throne, I am the latest
I am the bravest, go toe to toe with the giants
I ain't afraid of you niggas, I'll end up fading you niggas
'Fore it's all said and done, this nigga need medicine
My uzi, it weighed a ton, I need me a better gun
In fact I just might need two, cause niggas say they the one
And I got something to prove
Forgive me lord here they come, BLAOOW

[Hook]
Nigga why you actin' like a ho?
Know that I'ma ride for ya, either way it go
Tell me, girl why you be stressin' me for time?
When you tell me you love me, can't you see I'm tryna climb?
Damn my nigga why you actin' like a bitch?
If you scared to take a chance, how the fuck we gon' get rich?
Come here baby why you always insecure?
Hold on tight to a nigga and be sure

[Verse 2]
My inhibition's fighting my intuition
Premature premonition, showing me the demolition
Of these phony niggas, so ahead of my time
Even when I rhyme about the future I be reminiscing
You want the truth well come and listen
I'm like that time you bagged a dime and checked ya phone and saw it was a number missing
As fate passes you by, half of you try
The other half of you fry, too high to actually fly
One day y'all have to decide, who you gon' be
A scary nigga or a nigga that's gon' rule like me
Keep it true like me, Cole you might be
Like the new Ice Cube, meets the new Ice-T
Meets 2 Live Crew, meets the new Spike Lee
Meets Bruce like Wayne, meets Bruce like Lee
Meets '02 Lil Wayne, in a new white tee
Meets KD, ain't no nigga that can shoot like me!
BLAOOOW!

[Hook]
Nigga why you actin' like a ho?
Know that I'ma ride for ya, either way it go
Tell me, girl why you be stressin' me for time?

Damn my nigga why you actin' like a bitch?
If you scared to take a chance, how the fuck we gon' get rich?
Come here baby why you always insecure?
Hold on tight to a nigga and be sure

[Bridge]
(Who's the king?)
Came from the bottom nigga, with stains on my shirt
What you expected from me, I came from the dirt
(Who's the king?)
Money my motivator, the songs that I sing
Picture a peasant passin' from pawn to a king
You tell me ya still love me, if so then let me go
Will I return or will I burn, never know
Look in my eyes and see the future
But don't sugar coat it

[Verse 3]
Listen...
History repeats itself and that's just how it goes
Same way that these rappers always bite each others flows
Same thing that my nigga Elvis did with Rock n Roll
Justin Timberlake, Eminem and then Macklemore
While silly niggas argue over who gon' snatch the crown
Look around, my nigga, white people have snatched the sound
This year I'll prolly go to the awards dappered down
Watch Iggy win a Grammy as I try to crack a smile
I'm just playin', but all good jokes contain true shit
Same rope you climb up on, they'll hang you with
But not Jermaine, my aim too sick
I bang nigga, I came to bring the pain my brain too quick
You see how I maneuver this game, I ain't stupid
I recognize that life is a dream, and I dream lucid
And break the chains and change minds
One verse at a time, and claim 2-6
And fuck it, if the shoe fits, who's the king?

[Outro]
We all kings
(We all kings nigga)
Kings of ourselves first and foremost
(True)
While the people debate who's the king of this rap game
Here comes lil' ol' Jermaine
With every ounce of strength in his veins
To snatch the crown from whoever y'all think has it
But rather than place it on his head as soon as he grabs it
Poof, boom, paow, it's like magic
With a flash and a BANG the crown disintegrates
And falls to the Earth from which it came
It's done
Ain't gonna be no more kings
Be wary of any man that claims
Because deep down he clings onto the need for power
The reality, he's a coward
Ultimately he's scared to die
And sometimes so am I
But when I'm in tune with the most high
I realize, the fear lies in my lack of awareness of the other side
Today I know that we are the same, are the same, you and I
Different kind of skin, different set of eyes
Two different minds, but only one God
(It's only one God nigga)
It's for all the kings
'Cause I know deep down every poet just wanna be loved

[Intro]
Go, go, go
Go, go, go
Go, go, go
Go, go, go

[Chorus]
This is what you call a flip
Ten keys from a quarter brick
Bentley from his mama's whip
K.O.D., he hard as shit
This is what you call a flip
Ten keys from a quarter brick
Bentley from his mama's whip
K.O.D., he hard as shit
This is what you call a flip
Ten keys from a quarter brick
Bentley from his mama's whip
K.O.D., he hard as shit
This is what you call a flip
Ten keys from a quarter brick
Bentley from his mama's whip
K.O.D., he hard as shit

[Verse 1]
Wow, niggas been crampin' my style
Blowin' my high, they want a reply
The number one question is, "How?"
How does it feel now that you on?
How much you worth? How big is your home?
How come you won't get a few features?
I think you should? How 'bout I don't?
How 'bout you just get the fuck off my dick?
How 'bout you listen and never forget?
Only gon' say this one time, then I'll dip
Niggas ain't worthy to be on my shit
Haven't you heard? I'm as cold as the tip
Tip of the iceberg that tipped the Titanic
No tip-toein' around it, my shit is gigantic
As big as the fuckin' Atlantic, I'm lit, bitch

[Chorus]
This is what you call a flip
Ten keys from a quarter brick
Bentley from his mama's whip
K.O.D., he hard as shit
This is what you call a flip
Ten keys from a quarter brick
Bentley from his mama's whip
K.O.D., he hard as shit
This is what you call a flip
Ten keys from a quarter brick
Bentley from his mama's whip
K.O.D., he hard as shit
This is what you call a flip
Ten keys from a quarter brick
Bentley from his mama's whip
K.O.D., he hard as shit

[Verse 2]
How I grew up, only few would've loved
'Member I got my first view of the blood
I'm hangin' out and they shoot up the club
My homie got pharmaceutical plug
I smoke the drug and it run through my vein
I think it's workin', it's numbin' the pain
Don't give a fuck and I'm somewhat insane
Don't give a fuck and I'm somewhat insane
Yeah, at this shit daily, sipped so much Actavis
I convinced Actavis that they should pay me
If practice made perfect, I'm practice's baby
If practice made perfect, I'm practice's baby
Platinum wrist ridin' in back like Miss Daisy
Platinum disc and I own masters, bitch, pay me
Y'all niggas trappin' so lack-sical-daisy
My nigga sell crack like it's back in the '80s
Know a young nigga, he actin' so crazy
He serve a few packs and he jack a Mercedes
He shoot at the police, he clap at old ladies
He don't give a fuck if them crackers gon' hang him
Bitches been askin', "What have you done lately?"
I stacked a few M's like my last name was Shady
My life is too crazy, no actor could play me
My life is too crazy, no actor could play me

[Chorus]
This is what you call a flip
Ten keys from a quarter brick
Bentley from his mama's whip
K.O.D., he hard as shit
This is what you call a flip
Ten keys from a quarter brick
Bentley from his mama's whip
K.O.D., he hard as shit
This is what you call a flip
Ten keys from a quarter brick
Bentley from his mama's whip
K.O.D., he hard as shit
This is what you call a flip
Ten keys from a quarter brick
Bentley from his mama's whip
K.O.D., he hard as shit

[Outro]
Power, greed
Money, Molly, weed
Percs, Xannys, lean, fame
And the strongest drug of them all
And the strongest drug of them all
Love

[Verse 1]
Since a youngin' always dreamed of gettin' rich
Look at me my nigga
Fantasize about a white picket fence
With some trees my nigga
Used to want a Pathfinder with some tints
That's all I need my nigga
Throw some 20's on that bitch and get it rinsed
But now I see my nigga
That the world's a lot bigger ever since
Picked up the paper
And they say my nigga Eddie caught a body, I'm convinced
Anybody is a killer, all you gotta do is push 'em to the limits
Fuck being timid in the Civic
Politicin' with the pushers and the pimps
I'm tryna write a story, can I get a glimpse?
Yeah, can I get a glimpse?

[Hook 1]
Last night I had a bad dream
That I was trapped in this city
Then I asked is that really such a bad thing?
They robbin' niggas on the daily
Can you blame a nigga that ain't never had things?
Guess not! (What's the value of a thing?)
Last night they pulled up on my nigga at the light like'
Ugh, nice watch, run it
Hands in the air now, hands in the air, run it
Hands in the air now, hands in the air, run it
Hands in the air now, hands in the air
Hands in the air now, hands in the air

[Bridge]
Small town nigga Hollywood dreams
I know that everything that glitters ain't gold
I know the shit ain't always good as it seems
But tell me till you get it how could you know?
How could you know? How could you know?

[Verse 2]
Listen up I'm about to go and get rich
Fuck with me my nigga
We gon' circle round the Ville and hit a lick
Cop some tree my nigga
And some powder, bag it up and make it flip
You gon' see my nigga
One day we gon' graduate and cop a brick
And that's the key my nigga
Listen up I'm 'bout to go and get rich
Stand back and watch if you want to nigga
Me I want my pockets fat, a badder bitch
Tired of seein' niggas flaunt, I wanna flaunt too nigga
Watch some rollers in a fuckin' Crown Vic
Tryna lock a nigga up, that's what they won't do nigga
Wanna know a funny thing about this shit?
Even if you let em' kill your dream
It'll haunt you nigga, haunt you

[Hook 2]
Last night I had a bad dream
That I was trapped in this city
Then I asked is that really such a bad thing?
I look around like'
Do you wanna be another nigga, that ain't never had things?
Guess not! (What's the value of a thing?)
Last night we pulled up on a nigga at the light like
(You know what the fuck it is nigga, run that shit!)
Uh, nice watch, run it
Hands in the air now, hands in the air, run it
Hands in the air now, hands in the air, run it
Hands in the air now, hands in the air
Hands in the air now, hands in the air

[Outro]
Father forgive me for my childish ways
I look outside and all the clouds are gray
I need your hands to take me miles away
Your wish is my command, my command, my command
But before you go I've got to warn you now
Whatever goes up surely must come down
And you'll get your piece, but know peace won't be found
So why just take me man, take me man, take me man
Your wish is my command, my command, my command

[Intro: J. Cole]
Yeah (For your eyes)
For your eyes only (For your eyes)
For your eyes only, for your eyes only
(For your eyes, for your eyes)
For your eyes only

[Verse 1: J. Cole]
Hey, niggas be dying on the daily
It seems my dreams faded for far too long
The consequences deadly
Can't visualize myself as nothing but a criminal
Control the block, serving up rocks and stay subliminal
'Cause young niggas is hardheaded, they letting off
Full of adrenaline, ignorant to what death can cause
Ain't no coming back, family dressed in black
Plus it's hot now, the cops outside, it's hard to flip a pack
And my daughter gotta eat, her mama be stressing me
Like I ain't the one who put them Jays on her feet
Like I ain't out in the field like that
I might be low for the moment but I will bounce back
Despite the charges, back to the wall, I fight regardless
Screaming, "Fuck the law," my life is lawless
That's what you call it, ain't got to be no psychic
To see this is like the farthest thing from heaven
This is hell and I don't mean that hyperbolic
I try to find employment even if it's wiping toilets
But these felonies be making life the hardest
Resisting the temptation to run up and swipe a wallet
Or run up on your yard, snatch your daughter bike and pawn it
That's why I write this sonnet
If the pressure get too much for me to take and I break
Play this tape for my daughter and let her know my life is on it
(For your eyes) Let her know my life is on it
(For your eyes) For your eyes only

[Hook: J. Cole]
For your eyes, do you understand?
For your eyes, do you understand me?
For your eyes, do you understand?
For your eyes, do you understand me?
For your eyes, do you understand?
For your eyes, do you understand me?
For your eyes, do you understand?
For your eyes only

[Verse 2: J. Cole]
You probably grown now so this song'll hit you
If you hearing this, unfortunately means
That I'm no longer with you in the physical
Not even sure if I believe in God but because you still alive
He got me praying that the spiritual is real
So I can be a part of you still, my pops was killed too
So I know how part of you feels
Maybe you hate me, maybe you miss me, maybe you spite me
Life goes in cycles, maybe you'll date a nigga just like me
I hope not, I'm tired of dope spots
And fiends that smoke rocks
I've seen far too many niggas' hopes rot
I'm writing this because me and the devil had a dance
Now I see death around the corner, 'pologizing in advance
Don't know if I ever had a chance
At a glance, I'm a failure
Addicted to pushing paraphernalia
But Daddy had dreams once, my eyes had a gleam once
Innocence disappeared by the age of eight years
My Pops shot up, drug-related, mama addicted
So Granny raised me in projects where thugs was hanging
Blood was staining the concrete
Older niggas I loved talked like they was above
Maintaining a timesheet, that's slow money
Picked up the family business by the age of 13
Six years later was handed sentence
'Round the same time is when you came in this world
Me and your mama thinking:
"What the fuck we naming this girl?"
I told her "Nina," the prettiest name that I could think of
For the prettiest thing my eyes had ever seen, I was 19
Took me two felonies to see the trap
This crooked-ass system set for me
And now I fear it's too late for me to ever be
The one that set examples that was never set for me
I'm living fast, but not fast enough
'Cause karma keeps on catching up to me
And if my past becomes the death of me
I hope you understand

[Hook: J. Cole]
For your eyes, do you understand?
For your eyes, do you understand me?
For your eyes, do you understand?
For your eyes, do you understand me?
For your eyes, do you understand?
For your eyes, do you understand me?
For your eyes, do you understand?
For your eyes only

[Verse 3: J. Cole]
It's several ways I could've went out, too many to count
Was it the trigger happy crackers that the badges give clout?
Was it the young niggas, blasting frustrated
'Cause the cash running out?
Niggas don't know how to act in a drought
See, baby girl, I realized
My definition of a real nigga was skewed
My views misshaped by new mixtapes
That confirmed the shit I learned in the streets was true
That real niggas don't speak when they beef with you
They just pull up on your street, let the heat achoo
And if a real nigga hungry, he gon' eat your food
I was a fool, spent all my time ducking school, ducking cops
Ducking rules, hugging blocks that don't love you
I pray you find a nigga with goals and point of views
Much broader than the corner, if not it's gon' corner you
Into a box, where your son don't even know his pops
And the cyclical nature of doing time continues
My worst fear is one day that you come home from school
And see your father face while hearing 'bout tragedy on news
I got the strangest feeling your daddy gonna lose his life soon
And sadly if you're listening now it must mean it's true
But maybe there's a chance that it's not
And this album remains locked
In a hard drive like valuable jewels
And I can teach you this in person
Like I'm teaching you to tie your own shoes
I love you and I hope to God I don't lose you
For your eyes only

[Hook: CharGaux & J. Cole]
For your eyes, for your eyes only
For your eyes, for your eyes only
For your eyes, do you understand?
For your eyes only

[Verse 4: J. Cole]
One day your daddy called me, told me he had a funny feeling
What he'd been dealing with lately, he wasn't telling
I tried to pick his brains, still he wasn't revealing
But I could feel the sense of panic in his voice
And it was chilling, he said:
"Jermaine, I knew you since we was children
I never asked for nothing, when times was hard
I never had discussions with you, begging you to help me
I dealt with the repercussions of my actions
I know you tried to steer me 'way from that shit
But that shit was in my blood, you know my life
I know your momma, nigga, send my love
In case I never get a chance to speak again
I won't forget the weekends spent sleeping at your crib
That's the way I wished my family lived
But my granny crib was in the 'jects"
I had to interject like:
"Nigga, what you talking 'bout? Fuck is you getting at?"
He said, "Listen, I got no time to dive into descriptions
But I been having premonitions
Just call it visions from the other side
I got a feeling I won't see tomorrow
Like the time I'm living on is borrowed
With that said, the only thing I'm proud to say, I was a father
Write my story down, and if I pass
Go play it for my daughter when she ready"
And so I'm leaving you this record, for your eyes only
Don't you ever scratch or disrespect it
This perspective is a real one, another lost 'Ville son
I dedicate these words to you and all the other children
Affected by the mass incarceration in this nation
That sent your pops to prison when he needed education
Sometimes I think that segregation would've done us better
Although I know that means that I would never
Be brought into this world 'cause my daddy was so thrilled
When he found him a white girl to take back to Jonesboro
With lil' Zach and Cole World, barely one years old
Now it's 30 years later, making sure this story's told
Girl, your daddy was a real nigga, not 'cause he was cold
Not because he was the first
To get some pussy 12 years old
Not because he used to come through
In the Caddy on some vogues
Not because he went from bagging up
Them grams to serving O's
Nah, your daddy was a real nigga, not 'cause he was hard
Not because he lived a life of crime and sat behind some bars
Not because he screamed, "Fuck the law"
Although that was true
Your daddy was a real nigga 'cause he loved you
For your eyes only

1985, I arrived
33 years, damn, I'm grateful I survived
We wasn't s'posed to get past 25
Joke's on you motherfucker, we alive
All these niggas popping now is young
Everybody say the music that they make is dumb
I remember I was 18
Money, pussy, parties, I was on the same thing
You gotta give a boy a chance to grow some
Everybody talkin' like they know somethin' these days
Niggas actin' woke, but they broke, umm
I respect the struggle but you all frontin' these days
Man, they barely old enough to drive
To tell them what they should do, who the fuck am I?
I heard one of 'em diss me, I'm surprised
I ain't trippin', listen good to my reply
Come here lil' man, let me talk with ya
See if I can paint for you the large picture
Congrats 'cause you made it out your mama's house
I hope you make enough to buy your mom a house
I see your watch icy and your whip foreign
I got some good advice, never quit tourin'
'Cause that's the way we eat here in this rap game
I'm fuckin' with your funky lil' rap name
I hear your music and I know that rap's changed
A bunch of folks would say that that's a bad thing
'Cause everything's commercial and it's pop now
Trap drums is the shit that's hot now
See, I've been on a quest for the next wave
But never mind, that was just a segue
I must say, by your songs I'm unimpressed, hey
But I love to see a Black man get paid
And plus, you havin' fun and I respect that
But have you ever thought about your impact?
These white kids love that you don't give a fuck
'Cause that's exactly what's expected when your skin black
They wanna see you dab, they wanna see you pop a pill
They wanna see you tatted from your face to your heels
And somewhere deep down, fuck it, I gotta keep it real
They wanna be black and think your song is how it feels
So when you turn up, you see them turnin' up too
You hit the next city, collect your money when it's due
You gettin' that paper, swimmin' in bitches, I don't blame you
You ain't thinkin' 'bout the people that's lookin' like me and you
True, you got better shit to do
You coulda bought a crib with all that bread that you done blew
I know you think this type of revenue is never endin'
But I wanna take a minute just to tell you that ain't true
One day, them kids that's listening gon' grow up
And get too old for that shit that made you blow up
Now your show's lookin' light cause they don't show up
Which unfortunately means the money slow up
Now you scramblin' and hopin' to get hot again
But you forgot you only popped 'cause you was ridin' trends
Now you old news and you goin' through regrets
'Cause you never bought that house, but you got a Benz
And a bunch of jewels and a bunch of shoes
And a bunch of fake friends, I ain't judgin' you
I'm just tellin' you what's probably gon' happen when you rappin'
'Bout the type of shit you rappin' 'bout
It's a faster route to the bottom
I wish you good luck
I'm hoping for your sake that you ain't dumb as you look
But if it's really true what people sayin'
And you call yourself playin' with my name
Then I really know you fucked, trust
I'll be around forever 'cause my skills is tip-top
To any amateur niggas that wanna get rocked
Just remember what I told you when your shit flop
In five years you gon' be on Love & Hip-Hop, nigga

[Intro]
I guess the neighbors think I'm sellin' dope, sellin' dope
Okay, the neighbors think I'm sellin' dope,  sellin' dope
Sellin' dope, sellin' dope, sellin' dope

[Verse 1]
Yeah, I don't want no picture with the president
I just wanna talk to the man
Speak for the boys in the bando
And my nigga never walkin' again
Apologize if I'm harpin' again
I know these things happen often
But I'm back on the scene
I was lost in a dream
As I write this, the team down in Austin
I been buildin' me a house
Back home in the South, ma
Won't believe what it's costin'
And it's fit for a king, right?
Or a nigga that could sing
And explain all the pain that it cost him
My sixteen should've came with a coffin
Fuck the fame and the fortune
Well, maybe not the fortune
But one thing is for sure though
The fame is exhaustin'
That's why I moved away, I needed privacy
Surrounded by the trees and Ivy League
Students that's recruited highly
Thinkin' "You do you and I do me"
Crib has got a big 'ol back 'ol yard
My niggas stand outside and pass cigars
Filled with marijuana, laughin' hard
Thankful that they friend's a platinum star
In the driveway there's no rapper cars
Just some shit to get from back and forth
Just some shit to get from back and forth
Welcome to the Sheltuh, this is pure
We'll help you if you've felt too insecure
To be the star you always knew you were
Wait, I think police is at the door

[Chorus]
Okay, the neighbors think I'm sellin' dope
Hm, I guess the neighbors think I'm sellin' dope, sellin' dope
The neighbors think I'm'neighbors think I'm'
(Don't follow me, don't follow me...)
I think the neighbors think I'm sellin' dope
(Don't follow me, don't follow me...)
I guess the neighbors think I'm sellin' dope, sellin' dope
Sellin' dope, sellin' dope, sellin' dope
Well, motherfucker, I am

[Verse 2]
Some things you can't escape:
Death, taxes, and a ra-
-cist society that make
Every nigga feel like a candidate
For a Trayvon kinda fate
Even when your crib sit on a lake
Even when your plaques hang on a wall
Even when the president jam your tape
Took a little break just to annotate
How I feel, damn, it's late
I can't sleep cause I'm paranoid
Black in a white man territory
Cops bust in with the army guns
No evidence of the harm we done
Just a couple neighbors that assume we slang
Only time they see us we be on the news, in chains, damn

[Bridge]
Don't follow me
Don't follow me
Don't follow me
Don't follow me

[Chorus]
Okay, the neighbors think I'm sellin' dope
Hm, I guess the neighbors think I'm sellin' dope, sellin' dope
The neighbors think I'm...neighbors think I'm'
(Don't follow me, don't follow me...)
I think the neighbors think I'm sellin' dope
(Don't follow me, don't follow me...)
I guess the neighbors think I'm sellin' dope, sellin' dope
Sellin' dope, sellin' dope, sellin' dope
Well motherfucker, I am

[Outro]
I am, I am, I am, I am
Well, motherfucker, I am
I think the neighbors think I'm sellin' dope
I am, I am, I am
Well, motherfucker, I am
So much for integration
Don't know what I was thinkin'
I'm movin' back to south side
So much for integration
Don't know what I was thinkin'
I'm movin' back to south side

[Intro: J. Cole & Amber Coffman (Sampled)]
She knows
She knows, ayy
Bad things happen to the people you love
And you find yourself praying up to heaven above
But honestly I've never had much sympathy
'Cause those bad things, I always saw them coming for me
I'm gonna run run away (oh I), run run away, run away (oh I-I-I)
Run away and never come back (well all right)
Run run away, run run away (oh I), run away (oh I-I-I)
Show 'em that your color is black (well all right)

[Verse 1]
Damned if I do
Damned if I don't
You know I got a girl back home
You got a man what you want, what you want
What these bitches want from a nigga?
On some DMX shit
I know them other niggas love tricking
On some BMX shit
But not me
Now I'm sure you done heard about me
A black star, Mos Def, Kweli
Good so them bad hoes try me, they try me
This is Martin Luther King in the club
Getting dubs, with a bad bitch in his ear
Sayin' that she down for whatever
In the back of his mind is Coretta

[Chorus]
And she knows
She knows
And I know she knows
And I know she knows
And deep down she knows
She knows
And I know she knows
And I know she knows

[Refrain]
Well all right
Oh I
Oh I-I-I
I can't be what you want from me, well all right
Oh I
Oh I-I-I
I can't be what you want from me, well all right

[Verse 2]
Damned if I do (shit)
Damned if I don't
I'm passing up on bad hoes
Trying to be the man that she want, what she want?
What she'what she want from a nigga?
To put a ring on it
Got a bitch on my dick right now
And she just want to sing on it
Got me up so high
Try and get a piece of that apple pie
I be up so high
Try and get a piece of that apple pie
Dancehall vibes with my pants on fire
'Cause I told her I was sleep
'Cause I creep with this pretty young thing that I chose
She could be doing the same thing I suppose

[Chorus]
And she knows
She knows
And I know she knows
And I know she knows
And deep down she knows
She knows
And I know she knows
And I know she knows

[Refrain]
Well all right
Oh I
Oh I-I-I
I can't be what you want from me, well all right
Oh I
Oh I-I-I
I can't be what you want from me, well all right

[Bridge 1]
Niggas say turn up, hoes say turn up
Only bad thing 'bout a star is they burn up
Niggas say turn up, hoes say turn up
Only bad thing 'bout a star is they burn up
Rest in peace to Aaliyah
Rest in peace to Left Eye (Left Eye)
Michael Jackson, I'll see ya
Just as soon as I die (I die)

[Bridge 2]
Got me up so high
Try and get a piece of that apple pie
I be up so high
Try and get a piece of that apple pie
Got me up so high
Try and get a piece of that apple pie
I be up so high
Try and get a piece of that apple pie

[Refrain]
Well all right
Oh I
Oh I-I-I
I can't be what you want from me, well all right
Oh I
Oh I-I-I
I can't be what you want from me, well all right

[Chorus: J. Cole & Kendrick Lamar]
Me and my bitch, took a little trip
Down to the garden, took a little dip (Oh no)
Apple juice falling from her lips, took a little sip
Lil' sip, took a lil' sip
Took a lil' sip, t-took a lil', took a lil', took a lil' sip

[Verse 1: J. Cole]
Ayo, I walk through the valley of the shadow of death
Where niggas hold tech's like they mad at the ref
That's why I keep a cross on my chest, either that or a vest
Do you believe that Eve had Adam in check
And if so, you gotta expect
To sip juice from the forbidden fruit and get loose
Cole is the king, most definite
My little black book thicker than the Old Testament
Niggas pay for head but the pussy sold separate
Same bitch giving brains to the minister
The same reason they call Mr. Cee the finisher
Forbidden fruit, watch for the Adam's apple
Slick with words don't hate me, son
What you eat don't make me shit and who you fuck don't make me cum
Put a price on my head won't make me run
Try to kill me but it can't be done
'Cause my words gon' live forever
You put two and two together Cole here forever

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
Me and my bitch, took a little trip
Down to the garden, took a little dip (Oh no)
Apple juice falling from her lips, took a little sip

[Post-Chorus: Kendrick Lamar & J. Cole]
Bitches come and go (You know that)
Money come and go (You know that)
Love come and go (Don't shit last)
Bitches come and go (You know that)
Money come and go (You know that)
Love come and go (Don't shit last)

[Verse 2: J. Cole]
Take a seat baby girl you've been all in my mind
I know I ain't called gotta pardon my grind
Just copped a maroon 5, no Adam Levine
'Came a man by myself, only father was time
I know that she relate baby daddy ain't shit
So she raised that nigga kids but she swallowing mine
And that's why you all on my mind
All on my line like caller number nine
'Cause a nigga poppin' like Harlem in the nine-seven
Way before Mase was a reverend
I was a young nigga making A's at 11
Or 12, trying to get a taste of the Heaven
Or Hell, only time gon' tell
Fuck her while her mama home, "baby, don't yell"
How many records do a nigga gotta sell
Just to get the cover of the XXL
Or Fader, fuck your magazine hater
When I say that I'm the greatest I ain't talking about later
I'ma drop the album same day as Kanye
Just to show the Boyz the man now like Wany'
And I don't mean no disrespect, I praise legends
But this what's next, the boy sick, can't disinfect
Life's a bitch and her pussy's wet
My clip is loaded and this is the kiss of... death
Blaow

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
Me and my bitch, took a little trip
Down to the garden, took a little dip (Oh no)
Apple juice falling from her lips took a little sip

[Post-Chorus: Kendrick Lamar & J. Cole]
Bitches come and go (You know that)
Money come and go (You know that)
Love come and go (Don't shit last)
Bitches come and go (You know that)
Money come and go (You know that)
Love come and go (Don't shit last)

[Outro: J. Cole]
Don't shit last, don't shit last and you know that
Went to hell, got hot didn't melt
The only man above me is God himself
All these other niggas is below me
Word to Phife, Q-Tip, Ali, and Jarobi
What up Queens
Cole is the King and you know that
Started with a dollar and a dream, and you know that
Never give a bird bitch a ring, you should know that
Bitch, bitch
That should be my new ad lib
I got a new one. I finally got a cool ad lib
Be at all the shows everybody be like, bitch
Bitch, bitch
Or you can do the low cool shit, bitch

[Outro Skit: Lil Cole]
Yo, yo, yo pull over right here, right here, here you go
Yeah pull over right here, to the right
Pull over, pull over, pull over, pull over
Ight, look look, park right here
I'ma be out it'll be like thirty minutes tops
It'll be like thirty minutes, I'll be right back out, ight
Bitches come and go, bitches come and
Yo, yo what up, what's popping, I'm back, I'm back
Yo you got that piece ready for me, that Jesus piece
Nah the gold, the rose gold joint, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah let me see that, oh shit what is that some
What's, what the fuck is that platinum
Is that? What's that chain right there
Is that-ss-ss white gold, that's platinum
Is that plat, well niggas doing platinum again, niggas doing, niggas ain't even platinum yet right, oh shit bout to make
Yo I'm trying to bring that shit back, kill these niggas
Let me see that one too, the wat, the watch, the platinum watch

[Produced by Willie B]

[Verse 1]
I grew up, a fucking screw up
Tie my shoe up, wish they was newer
Damn, need something newer
In love with the baddest girl in the city, I wish I knew her
I wish I wasn't so shy, I wish I was a bit more fly
I wish that I could tell her how I really feel inside
That I'm the perfect nigga for her, but then maybe that's a lie
She like a certain type of nigga and it's clear I'm not that guy
Ball player, star player, I'm just watchin' from the side
On the bench, 'cause my lack of confidence won't let me fly
I ain't grow up with my father, I ain't thinkin' 'bout that now
Fast forward four years or so from now I'll probably cry
When I realize what I missed, but as of now my eyes are dry
'Cause I'm trying to stay alive
In the city where too many niggas die
Dreamin' quiet trying to dodge a suit and tie
Who am I?
Ayy, who am I? (Yeah)

[Chorus]
Things change, rearrange and so do I
It ain't always for the better, dawg, I can't lie
I get high 'cause the lows can be so cold
I might bend a little bit but I don't fold
One time for my mind and two for yours
I got food for your thoughts to soothe your soul
If you see my tears fall just let me be
Move along, nothing to see

[Verse 2]
I always did shit the hard way
My nigga [inaudible] slangin' in the hallway
Burnt CD's and trees like this was Broadway
Times Square, kept the dimes there in the locker
Some Reggie Miller
With more brown hairs than Chewbacca
Whispers that he got it for the low-low, sell a
Dime for a dub, them white boys ain't know no better
Besides, what's twenty dollars to a nigga like that?
He tell his pops he need some lunch
And he gon' get it right back
I peep game
Got home snatched my mama keychain
Took her whip, the appeal, too ill to refrain
I hit the boulevard pull up to my nigga front do'
His mama at home, she still let 'em hit the blunt though
I told her hello, and sat with my nigga and laughed
And talked about how we gon' smash all the bitches in class
I complimented how I see him out here getting his cash
And just asked, "What a nigga gotta do to get that?
Put me on," he just laughed when he seen I was sure
17 years breathing his demeanor said more
He told me, "Nigga, you know how you sound right now?
If you wasn't my mans
I would think that you a clown right now
Listen, you everything I wanna be that's why I fucks with you
So how you looking up to me when I look up to you?
You bout to go get a degree, I'ma be stuck with two choices:
Either graduate to weight or selling number two
For what? A hundred bucks or two a week?
Do you think that you would know what to do if you was me?
I got, four brothers, one mother that don't love us
If they ain't want us why the fuck they never wore rubbers?"
I felt ashamed to have ever complained about my lack of gear
And thought about how far we done came
From trailer park to a front yard with trees in the sky
Thank you mama, dry your eyes, there ain't no reason to cry
You made a genius and I, ain't gon' take it for granted
I ain't gon' settle for lesser, I ain't gon' take what they handed
Nah, I'm gon' take what they owe me
And show you that I can fly
And show old girl what she missing, the illest nigga alive
Ayy, who am I?

[Chorus]
Things change, rearrange and so do I
(Ayy, who am I?)
It ain't always for the better, dawg, I can't lie
(Who am I?)
I get high 'cause the lows can be so cold
I might bend a little bit but I don't fold
One time for my mind and two for yours
I got food for your thoughts to soothe your soul
If you see my tears fall just let me be
Move along, nothing to see

[Outro]
I never felt better

[Intro]
Awwwww...haha

[Verse 1]
Now I was barely seventeen with a pocket full of hope
Screamin' "dollar and a dream" with my closet lookin' broke
And my nigga's lookin' clean, gettin' caught up with that dope
Have you ever served a fiend with a pocket full of soap?
Nigga I can tell you things that you probably shouldn't know
Have you ever heard the screams when the body hit the floor?
Flashbacks to the pain, wakin' up, cold sweats
Six o'clock in the mornin', gotta hit the BowFlex
Get my weight up on the block, keep watch for the cops
God they love to serve a nigga three hots and a cot
Nowadays crime pays like a part time job
And the drought got me prayin' for a Carl Thom vibe
Summer Rain come again
Numb the pain 'cause it's hard for a felon
In my mind I been cryin', know it's wrong but I'm sellin'
Eyes wellin' up with tears
Thinkin' 'bout my niggas dead in the dirt
Immortalized on this shirt

[Hook]
Real niggas don't die
Forward with the plot
One-Seven-Forty-Five
Form at the plot
Real niggas don't die
Form on the block
Real niggas don't lie
Form in the plot
My niggas don't die
Form on the block
Real niggas don't die
Form on the block
Real niggas don't die
Real niggas don't die

[Verse 2]
Have you ever seen a fiend cook crack on the spoon?
Have you ever seen a nigga that was black on the moon?
Have you ever seen your brother go to prison as you cry?
Have you ever seen a motherfuckin' ribbon in the sky?
Nope, all I see is that C.R.E.A.M nigga, that green
I'm a black king, black jeans on my black queen
And her ass fat, too fat for a flat screen
I'm the type of nigga make the whole fuckin' trap lean
Kingpin nigga, put wings on a crack fiend
If they want a nigga, they gon' have to send a SWAT team
And I'm goin' out like Scarface in his last scene
A legend, what that mean'?

[Hook]
Real niggas don't die
Forward with the plot
One-Seven-Forty-Five
Form at the plot
Real niggas don't die
Form on the block
Hood niggas don't lie
Form in the plot
My niggas don't die
Form on the block
Real niggas don't die
Form on the block
Real niggas don't die
Real niggas don't die

[Outro]
To die a young legend or live a long life unfulfilled
'Cause you wanna change the world, but while alive you never will
'Cause they only feel you after you gone, or I've been told
And now I'm caught between bein' heard and gettin' old
Damn, death creepin' in my thoughts lately
My one wish in this bitch, "Make it quick if the Lord take me"
I know nobody meant to live forever anyway
And so I hustle like my niggas in Virgini-A
They tellin' niggas, "sell dope, rap or go to NBA"
In that order, it's that sort of thinkin'
That been keepin' niggas chained at the bottom and hanged
The strangest fruit that you ever seen, ripe with pain, listen...

[Intro]
Ayo, ayo, ayo, ah, ayo, ah
Ayo, ayo, ayo, ah
Yeah

[Verse 1]
I hate rich niggas, god damn it
'Cause I ain't never had a lot, damn it
Who you had to kill? Who you had to rob?
Who you had to fuck just to make it to the top, damn it?
Or maybe that's daddy money, escalator, no ladder money
Escalade, new Caddy money
Worst fear going broke cause I'm bad with money
Crooked smile nigga, momma never had the money, damn
I ain't tripping
Nigga Jordan; I ain't Pippen, yeah
Up the steps, I ain't slipping
Tears, blood, sweat, and I ain't cripping
Here's a song you can sing along with
When you down on some let you know you ain't alone shit
When your momma ain't at home cause she got a second job
Delivering pizzas, you think she out here getting robbed
Please God watch her I know how niggas do
Half cracker but a nigga too
Talking all that shit 'bout your step-pops
How he was a dog, now look at you
I ain't bad as that nigga, plus dawg, I'm a grown man now
I ain't mad at that nigga
But if a plane crashed and it only killed his lame ass
I'd be glad it's that nigga, nigga
Did Kay dirty now it's back to broke
Refund checks, used that to float
Momma gets depressed, falls in love with the next maniac
On crack, use that to cope
Make a nigga smoke a whole sack of dope
Writing rhymes, tryna bring back the hope
Try to ride the storm out and crashed the boat
Could've drowned, but I grabbed the rope

[Pre-Hook]
And there go you, and there go you, and there go you
Selling me dreams and telling me things you knew
And there go you, and there go you, and there go you
Selling me dreams and telling me things you knew

[Hook]
Sing, you got what I want, I got what you need
"How much for your soul, Anna?"
"How much for your soul, Anna?"
You got what I want, I got what you need
"How much for your soul, Anna?"
"How much for your soul, Anna?"

[Verse 2]
I hate rich niggas, god damn it
'Cause I ain't never had a lot, damn it
Niggas can't front on the flows you got
But every fucking verse how much dough you got
Homie, don't quit now
Hear my shit and tried to switch now
Know you felt the shit just now, know you felt the shit just now
Ain't there more to you? Don't it ever get boring to you?
I realize deep down you a coward getting high off of power, fuck it more to you
Saw through you and it made me ashamed that I played the game
Not for mo' money like Damon Wayans
Wanted the respect but it came with fame
I just wanted love but this ain't the same
I took a train down memory lane
And watched little Jermaine do his thing before he made a name
It's like Sony signed Basquiat
He gave it all he got, and now a nigga don't paint the same, damn
I guess he can't complain
All the money that be raining in
Spend a hundred thou for the chain again
Think of old school niggas like Dana Dane
Probably kill for another claim to fame, my brain the same
Yeah, nigga, at least he ain't insane
At least he ain't insane
You ain't crazy, motherfucker, you just afraid of change
That's new, maybe that's true
But listen here I got a bigger fear
Of one day that I become you
When I become lost and I become heartless
And numb from all the M'nages
Just one bitch don't feel the same no more
And Henny don't really kill the pain no more
Now I'm Cobain with a shotgun aimed at my brain
Cause I can't maintain no more
Tad bit extreme I know
Money can't save your soul
But there go you

[Pre-Hook]
And there go you, and there go you, and there go you
Selling me dreams and telling me things you knew
And there go you, and there go you, and there go you
Selling me dreams and telling me things you knew

[Hook]
Sing, you got what I want, I got what you need
"How much for your soul, Anna?"
"How much for your soul, Anna?"
You got what I want, I got what you need
"How much for your soul, Anna?"
"How much for your soul, Anna?"

[Outro]
"How much for your soul, Anna?"
"How much for your soul, Anna?"

[Intro]
I want to see you work out for me, work out for me

[Chorus]
Ayy, we've got a good thing
Don't know if I'ma see you again
But is that a good thing?
'Cause girl, I can't be your man, no ma'am
I know what's on your brain
You probably hoped it never would end
Like, 'Is it the real thing
Or is it just a one-night stand?'
Well then

[Bridge]
Let me see you get high, then go low
Now, girl, won't you drop that thing down to the floor?
I'm here for one night, how far will you go?
I wanna see you (Work out for me, work out for me)
High, then go low
Now, girl, won't you drop that thing down to the floor?
I'm here for one night, how far will you go?
I wanna see you (Work out for me, work out for me)

[Verse 1]
She like them boys with the big ol' chains
Ridin' around town in a big ol' Range
I knew her when I rocked big ol' jeans
Now the little nigga doin' big ol' thangs
Would you look at that? I came back for her
Just to give it to ya, like you asked for it
Man, that thing in them jeans too fat for her
Rebounds so I caught her off the backboard
I told her: 'Baby girl, come here
Know I run the town even when I ain't from there.'
And I brag hardly, but just to show up at this party
I made what yo' nigga make in one year
That's unfair, but so is life, take a chance, roll the dice
Money can't buy you love, 'cause it's overpriced
Don't overthink, just hope it's right
I'm only here for the night

[Chorus]
Ayy, we've got a good thing
Don't know if I'ma see you again
But is that a good thing?
'Cause girl, I can't be your man, no ma'am
I know what's on your brain
You probably hoped it never would end
Like, 'Is it the real thing
Or is it just a one-night stand?'
Well then

[Bridge]
Let me see you get high, then go low
Now, girl, won't you drop that thing down to the floor?
I'm here for one night, how far will you go?
I wanna see you (Work out for me, work out for me)
High, then go low
Now, girl, won't you drop that thing down to the floor?
I'm here for one night, how far will you go?
I wanna see you (Work out for me, work out for me)

[Verse 2]
Carolina Blue kicks, fresh on the scene
Hottest nigga on the block
Damn, girl, you're mean
They be startin' shit, but it's yo' world
On my Martin shit: 'You go, girl!'
She bad and she know it
Some niggas save hoes, I'm not that heroic
Could you be my escort?
'Cause just like them two door Fords
Damn, they don't make 'em like you no more
Cole World, real Cole World
Them boys cool'me, I'm on fire
Know what's on my mind
Tryna see what's on yours tonight, tonight, tonight
Move slow, 'cause you wanna live fast
Up late so you'll probably skip class
Life is a test so before the night pass, get right, get right

[Chorus]
Ayy, we've got a good thing
Don't know if I'ma see you again
But is that a good thing?
'Cause girl, I can't be your man, no ma'am
I know what's on your brain
You probably hoped it never would end
Like, 'Is it the real thing
Or is it just a one-night stand?'
Well then (Cole World)

[Outro]
Straight up, now tell me
Do you really wanna love me forever? (Oh oh oh)
Or is it just a hit-and-run?
(Well, hey) Straight up, I tell ya
I just really wanna cut when we together (Oh oh oh)
Come here, girl, let's get it on!
(Work out for me)
Straight up, now tell me
Do you really wanna love me forever? (Oh oh oh)
Or is it just a hit-and-run?
Well straight up, I tell ya
I just really wanna cut when we together (Oh oh oh)
Come here, girl, let's get it on!
(Work out for me)

[Intro]
Life can bring much pain
There are many ways to deal with this pain
Choose wisely

[Refrain]
Will I fall? Will I fly?
Heal my soul
Fulfill my high
Cross my heart (Count, count, count, count it)
And hope to die (Count, count, count, count it)
With my slice (Count, count, count, count it)
Of Devil's pie

[Chorus]
Count it up, count it up, count it up, count it
Count it up, count it up, count it up, count it
Count it up, count it up, count it up, count it
Count it up, count it up, count it up, count it
Count it up, count it up, count it up, count it
Count it up, count it up, count it up, count it

[Verse 1]
I know that it's difficult
I'm stackin' this paper, it's sort of habitual
I blow the residual
And fuckin' yo bitch like its part of my ritual
Pardon the visual
But money, it give me a hard-on it's typical
I want it in physical
A million dollars, I count up in intervals
Without it I'm miserable
Don't wanna fall off so I'm all in my bag
Thankin' God like it's biblical
I know it's gon' solve every problem I have
I balled on the principal
Remember the teachers was all on my ass
Now look all of them, pitiful
And all of a sudden I'm so good at math

[Chorus]
Count it up, count it up, count it up, count it
Count it up, count it up, count it up, count it
Count it up, count it up, count it up, count it
Can't take it when you die, but you can't live without it
Count it up, count it up, count it up, count it
Count it up, count it up, count it up, count it
Count it up, count it up, count it up, count it
Can't take it when you die

[Refrain]
Uno, dos, tres

[Bridge]
Big bills, big bills
I fell in love with big wheels and quick thrills
My niggas runnin' tip drills, can't sit still
Don't give a fuck if it kills, it mix well
I'm only countin'
Big bills, big bills
I fell in love with big wheels and quick thrills
My niggas runnin' tip drills, can't sit still
Don't give a fuck if it kills, it mix well
I'm only countin'...

[Refrain]
Uno, dos, tres, cuatro

[Verse 2]
Proceed with caution
I heard if you chase it only results in
A hole in your heart
Fuck it, I take the whole cake and I won't leave a portion
It's only an organ
Thank God mama couldn't afford the abortion
The loneliest orphan
I flip my misfortune and grow me a fortune
My Rollie is scorchin'
Them niggas that hated is slowly endorsin'
Now Cole, he important
My niggas beside me like Tommy and Martin
We ball on your court and
Then skate with your bitch like we Tonya Harding
She don't need her garments
She horny from all the money we countin'

[Chorus]
Count it up, count it up, count it up, count it
Count it up, count it up, count it up, count it
Count it up, count it up, count it up, count it
Can't take it when you die, but you can't live without it
Count it up, count it up, count it up, count it
Count it up, count it up, count it up, count it
Count it up, count it up, count it up, count it
Can't take it when you die
Uno dos

[Refrain]
Will I fall? Will I fly?
Heal my soul
Fulfill my high
Cross my heart
And hope to die
With my slice of Devil's pie

[Intro: J. Cole]
My intuition is telling me there'll be better days, yeah
My intuition is telling me there'll be better days
I like this tone

[Verse 1: J. Cole]
Yeah, my intuition is telling me there'll be better days
I sit in silence and find whenever I meditate
My fears alleviate, my tears evaporate
My faith don't deviate, ideas don't have a date
But see I'm growing and getting stronger with every breath
Bringing me closer to Heaven's doors with every step
As we speak I'm at peace, no longer scared to die
Most niggas don't believe in God and so they terrified
It's either that or they be fearing they gon' go to Hell
Asking the Father for forgiveness, got 'em overwhelmed (Please, God, I want to go to Heaven)
As if He's spiteful like them white folks that control the jail
See I believe if God is real, He'd never judge a man
Because He knows us all and therefore He would understand
The ignorance that make a nigga take his brother life
The bitterness and pain that got him beating on his wife

[Chorus: J. Cole]
I know you desperate for a change let the pen glide
But the only real change come from inside (Come from inside)
But the only real change come from inside (Come from inside)
But the only real change come from'
In cemeteries or in chains I see men cry
But the only real change come from inside (Come from inside)
But the only real change come from inside (Come from inside)
But the only real change come from'

[Verse 2: J. Cole]
Yeah, my chosen religion
Jesus piece frozen from sinnin'
Doin' dirt, hoping to God, He know my intentions
To see a million 'fore I see a casket
I got a baby on the way, know he gon' be a bastard
I'm living fast like I'm in a drag race, how that cash taste
When I was a senior, I was ballin' on my classmates
Niggas put three bullets in my car, one hit the gas tank
Know I got a angel cause I'm supposed to have a halo
Right now, my lifestyle destined for a federal facility
For my ability to make them birds fly
Fiends wanna get higher than a bird's eye view
And who am I to tell a nigga what to do?
I just supply, it's economics
My business ain't got the suit and tie
Keep a pistol at all times, niggas want what's mine
I can't oblige, dog, I work too hard
So reach for it, get referred to God, I'm going hard, nigga

[Chorus: J. Cole]
I know you desperate for a change let the pen glide
But the only real change come from inside
But the only real change come from inside
But the only real change come from'
In cemeteries or in chains I see men cry
But the only real change come from inside
But the only real change come from inside
But the only real change come from'

[Verse 3: J. Cole]
Yeah, prodigal son, got a new gun
This one don't run out of ammo
Lately been working on my handles
Can I ball, become a star and remain my self?
If I fall, dust it off and regain my self
Fuck 'em all, they don't know all the pain I felt
I'm in awe, after all the fame I felt, I evolved
I no longer bury demons, I be a vessel for the truth until I'm barely breathing, I'm singing

[Bridge: Ari Lennox & J. Cole]
Life is all about the evolution
I give up, I give in, I move back a little
I live up, I look up, now I'm back for more
You can dream but don't neglect the execution
I give up, I give in, I move back a little
I live up, I look up, now I'm back for more
Time is short that's what somebody told me
I give up, I give in, I move back a little
I live up, I look up, now I'm back for more
Too short to keep following your homies
I give up, I give in, I move back a little
I live up, I look up, now I'm back for more

[Bridge: J. Cole]
I reminisce back to a time where niggas threw they hands
All of a sudden niggas pop a trunk and then we scram
Finger on trigger make a little nigga understand
What it's like to finally be the motherfuckin' man
Eyes wide that's from the power that the coward feels
Niggas die over bitches, disrespect, and dollar bills
Bloodshed that turned the city to a battlefield
I call it poison, you call it real (pop, pop, pop, pop)
That's how you feel?

[Verse 4: J. Cole]
Pistols be poppin' and niggas drop in a heartbeat
Scattered like roaches, a body laid on the concrete
A body laid on the concrete
Look, somebody laid on the concrete
No time for that, ain't no lookin' back, cause I'm running too
I made it home, I woke up and turned on the morning news
Overcame with a feeling I can't explain
Cause that was my nigga James that was slain, he was 22
(Last night at around...) He was 22
(22 year old black male, suspect, reporting live...)

[Outro: J. Cole]
(I swear to God, bruh)
We're gathered here today...
(I swear to God)
To mourn the life of James McMillan Jr
(I swear to God'nigga, I'ma kill them niggas, man)
A tragedy, another tragedy in the black community
(I promise you, bro...)
We got to do better, people
22 years old, this boy was too young
(I promise you, bro, I'ma kill them niggas, yo...)
Our condolences go to his family, our prayers
(I'ma kill them niggas myself...)
We know he's in a better place
We know he's in a better place
But this has got to end, ladies and gentleman
We've got to come together, this is'this is beyond words
Now I'd like to open this ceremony with a verse from'

[Produced by J. Cole & Team Titans]

[Intro]
Rap tune
Can I make a million dollars off a rap tune?
Can I make a million dollars off a rap tune?
I'm tryna make a million dollars off a rap tune
Yeah, look

[Verse 1]
The real is back, the ville is back
Flow bananas, here, peel this back
And what you'll find is, your highness
Can paint a picture that is vivid enough to cure blindness
Carolina's finest, you knew that already
In terms of the greatest, I proved that already
And if you would like, I do it twice
I just sharpen my blade, for a minute became lost in my ways
This for my niggas that was tossed in the graves
Every so often I fade deep in my thoughts
And then get lost in the days
We used to play before your coffin was made
Just got the call nigga got caught with a stray
Hope he's okay
Just got paid what Cochran got paid to free OJ
Just to share my life on the stage in front of strangers
Who know a nigga far too well, and that's the danger
Know me better than I know myself
I rip a page out my notebook in anger
And let these thoughts linger, singing

[Chorus]
Don't give 'em too much you (Don't give 'em too much you)
Don't let 'em take control (Don't let 'em take control)
It's one thing you do (It's one thing you do)
Don't let 'em taint your soul (Don't let 'em taint your soul)
If you believe in God (If you believe in God)
One thing's for sure (One thing's for sure)
If you ain't aim too high (If you ain't aim too high)
Then you aim too low (Then you aim too low)

[Verse 2]
What's the price for a black man life?
I check the toe tag, not one zero in sight
I turn the TV on, not one hero in sight
Unless he dribble or he fiddle with mics
Look out the window 'cause tonight the city lit up with lights
Cameras and action
May no man alive come through and damage my faction
I brought you niggas with me 'cause I  love you like my brothers
And your mothers' like my mother
Think we need a plan of action
The bigger we get the more likely egos collide, it's just physics
Please let's put our egos aside, you my niggas
And should our worst tendencies turn us into enemies
I hope that we remember these
Nights fulla Hennessey
When Hov around we switch up to that D'usse
Gotta show respect, one day we tryna stay where you stay
'Cause we from where you from
Not talkin' bout the slums
I'm talkin' 'bout that mind state that keep a black nigga dumb
Keep a black nigga dyin' by a black nigga gun
And keep on listening to the frontin' ass rap niggas son
Yeah I said 'son'
This is New York's finest
For 11 winters straight I took on New York's climate
Like show me New York's ladder
I climb it and set the bar so high that you gotta get Obama to force the air force to find it
Never mind it, you'll never reach that
Cole is the hypnotist, control the game whenever he snap
That's every track, nigga

[Chorus]
Don't give 'em too much you (Don't give 'em too much you)
Don't let 'em take control (Don't let 'em take control)
It's one thing you do (It's one thing you do)
Don't let 'em taint your soul (Don't let 'em taint your soul)
If you believe in God (If you believe in God)
One thing's for sure (One thing's for sure)
If you ain't aim too high (If you ain't aim too high)
Then you aim too low (Then you aim too low)

[Verse 3]
I ain't serve no pies, I ain't slang no dope
I don't bring no lies, niggas sang my quotes
I don't play no games, boy I ain't no joke
Like the great Rakim, when I make my notes
You niggas might be L or you might be Kane
Or you might be Slick Rick with 19 chains
Or you might be Drizzy Drake or Kendrick Lamar
But check your birth date nigga, you ain't the god
Nah you ain't the god
Nigga, Cole the god (Cole the god, Cole the god)
January 28th

[Outro]
Make a million dollars off a rap tune
Can I make a million dollars off a rap tune?
(*sound of baby laughing*)
I'm tryna make a million dollars off a rap tune
I wanna make a million dollars off a rap tune
I'm gonna make a million dollars off a rap tune

[Intro: J. Cole]
Ay, oh, yeah
Cole world, ah, oh, yeah

[Verse 1: J. Cole]
Yeah, this is for all the fans that waited, the bitch niggas that hated
Old hoes we dated, look, Mama; we made it
Your son out in Barbados, cheese, eggs, and potatoes
Smokin' weed on the beach as my mind workin' like Plato's
Analyzin' the world, fantasizin' 'bout girls
I'm handin' diamonds and pearls, and vandalizin' her curls
Sweatin' her weave out, moans as she breathes out
Fuck I'm doin' in parties with Hova and Steve Stoute
I step over piranha, death over dishonor
They killin' niggas for J's, that's death over designer
Hey, Cole heatin' up like that left-over lasagna
Remember when I used to be stressed over D'wana
Now a nigga only text and get stressed over Rihannas
I'm talkin' tens and better, hood bitches in Timbs and sweaters
And we always argue 'bout the same thing
And tell me, why we gotta argue about the same thing, same thing, man?

[Chorus: Missy Elliott]
Nobody's perfect, uh
Nobody's perfect, ay ay, uh
Hey, but you're perfect for me
Nobody's perfect, uh (Ay, ay, ay)
Nobody's perfect, ay
Hey, but you're perfect for me
We rollin', we ridin'
He like to go inside and
I love to go all night and
We rock the boat: Poseidon
I love to call your name, name, name
Yeah, baby, I love to call your name, name, name, eh

[Verse 2: J. Cole]
Oh yeah, to my college girl: Take the weekend off and come home soon
I graduated way too long ago to be sneakin' all in your dorm room
But that thing tight like Fort Knox
So I call you when the tour stops
But baby, where your roommates?
Did you make sure the door's locked?
She love it when we get together
Smoke a little weed, put her shit together
Now that I'm on I can pick and choose
Only fuck with hoes who got shit to lose
Yeah, I heard the stories 'bout different dudes
Her man on campus, but it's fine by me
She say she only fucked like four'five niggas
So you know you gotta multiply by three

[Chorus: Missy Elliott]
Nobody's perfect, uh
Nobody's perfect, ay ay, uh
Hey, but you're perfect for me
Nobody's perfect, uh (Ay, ay, ay)
Nobody's perfect, ay
Hey, but you're perfect for me
We rollin', we ridin'
He like to go inside and
I love to go all night and
We rock the boat: Poseidon
I love to call your name, name, name
Yeah, baby, I love to call your name, name, name, eh

[Intro]
Freedom or jail, clips inserted, a baby's bein' born
Same time my man is murdered; the beginning and end
As far as rap go, it's only natural, I explain
My plateau, and also what defines my name

[Refrain]
Yeah, long live the idols, may they never be your rivals
'Pac was like Jesus, Nas wrote the Bible
Now what you 'bout to hear is a tale of glory and sin
No I.D. my mentor, now let the story begin

[Verse 1]
I used to print out Nas' raps and tape 'em up on my wall
My niggas thought they was words, but it was pictures I saw
And since I wanted to draw, I used to read them in awe
Then he dropped Stillmatic, rocked the cleanest velour
Fast forward, who'd a thought that I would meet him on tour
I'm earnin' stripes now, a nigga got Adidas galore
Backstage I shook his hand, let 'em know that he's the man
When he said he was a fan it was too hard to understand
No time to soak up the moment though 'cause I was in a jam
Hov askin' where's the record that the radio could play
And I was strikin' out for months, 9th inning, feelin' fear
Jeter under pressure, made the biggest hit of my career
But at first, that wasn't clear, niggas had no idea
Dion called me when it dropped, sounded sad but sincere
Told me Nas heard your single and he hate that shit
Said, "You the one, yo, why you make that shit?"

[Chorus]
I can't believe I let Nas down
Damn, my heart sunk to my stomach
I can't believe I let Nas down
I got defensive on the phone
Resentment was in my tone, fuck it

[Refrain]
Long live the idols, may they never be your rivals
'Pac was like Jesus, Nas wrote the Bible
Now what you're 'bout to hear's a tale of glory and sin
No I.D. my mentor, now let the story begin

[Verse 2]
I couldn't help but think that maybe I had made a mistake
I mean, you made "You Owe Me"
Dog, I thought that you could relate
But while I shot up the charts
You mean tellin' me that I was not up to par
When I followed my heart
Granted, my heart was tainted
By my mind that kept on sayin'
"Where's the hits?" You ain't got none
You know Jay'll never put your album out without none
And, dog, you know how come
Labels are archaic, formulaic with they outcome
They don't know, they just study the charts
Me, I studied the shows, the fans, study they hearts
I had a feelin' I was killin', and this music we were spillin' out
Would change lives forever, fuck the label, put it out
Friday Night Lights blew, that was classic number two
Now it seemed as if the Nas comparisons was comin' true
Still no release date from the label, are they insane?
Gucc told me play the game to change the game

[Chorus]
But on the way I let Nas down
I got no one to blame
I'm ashamed, I let Nas down
But this is God's plan, you can never understand, fuck it

[Refrain]
Long live the idols, may they never be your rivals
'Pac was like Jesus, Nas wrote the Bible
Now what you're 'bout to hear's a tale of glory and sin
No I.D. my mentor, now let the story begin

[Verse 3]
I always believed in the bigger picture
If I could get them niggas to listen outside my core
Then I can open the door
Reintroduce them to honesty, show 'em that they need more
The difference between the pretenders and the Kendrick Lamars
And so, I took the fall
Like the son of the Lord on the cross
Dyin' for that fake shit you niggas bought
For the past decade
If I should pass, please let this be my last essay
Therefore I write from the heart
Apologies to OG's for sacrificin' my art
But I'm here for a greater purpose
I knew right from the start
I'm just a man of the people, not above but equal
And for the greater good I walk amongst the evil
Don't cry, Mama, this the life I choose myself
Just pray along the way that I don't lose myself
This is for the nigga that said that Hip-Hop was dead
I went to Hell to resurrect it
How could you fail to respect it?

[Chorus]
Letting Nas down, I got the phone call
Quietly I mourned, dog, I let Nas down
Yeah, and on this flight
May I never lose sight, fuck it

[Refrain]
Long live the idols, may they never be your rivals
'Pac was like Jesus, Nas wrote the Bible
Now what you just heard's a tale of glory and sin
No I.D. my mentor, now let the story begin

[Intro]
Somebody shoulda told me it would be like this
Be like this, be like this
Somebody shoulda told me it would be like this

[Verse 1]
Yeah, life is a balance
You lose your grip, you can slip into an abyss
No doubt, you see these niggas trippin'
Ego in charge of every move, he's a star
And we can't look away due to the days that he caught our hearts
He's fallin' apart, but we deny it
Justifying that half ass shit he dropped, we always buy it
When he tell us he a genius but it's clearer lately
It's been hard for him to look into the mirror lately
There was a time when this nigga was my hero, maybe
That's the reason why his fall from grace is hard to take
'Cause I believed him when he said his shit was purer and he
The type of nigga swear he real but all around him's fake
The women, the dickriders, you know, the yes men
Nobody with the balls to say somethin' to contest him
So he grows out of control
Into the person that he truly was all along, it's startin' to show
Damn, wonder what happened
Maybe it's my fault for idolizin' niggas
Based off the words they be rappin'
But come to find out, these niggas don't even write they shit
Hear some new style bubblin' up, then they bite this shit
Damn, that's what I get for lyin' to myself
Well, fuck it, what's more important is he's cryin' out for help
While the world's eggin' him on, I'm beggin' him to stop it
Playin' his old shit, knowin' he won't top it
False prophets

[Chorus]
Somebody shoulda told me it would be like this
Be like this, be like this
Somebody shoulda told me it would be like this
False prophets (La-la-la-la-la-la, la-la-la')
Somebody shoulda told me it would be like this
Be like this, be like this
Somebody shoulda told me it would be like this
Yeah, false prophets

[Verse 2]
I got a homie, he a rapper and he wanna win bad
He want the fame, the acclaim, the respect that's been had
By all the legends, so every time I see him, he stressin'
Talkin' 'bout, niggas don't fuck with him, this shit is depressin'
And I know he so bitter he can't see his own blessings
Goddamn, nigga, you too blind to see you got fans, nigga
And a platform to make a classic rap song
To change a nigga's life, but you too anxious livin' life
Always worried 'bout the critics who ain't ever fuckin' did it
I write what's in my heart, don't give a fuck who fuckin' with it
But in a sense I can relate, the need to be great
Turns into an obsession and keeps a nigga up late
Writin' words, hopin' people observe the dedication
That stirs in you constantly, but intentions get blurred
Do I do it for the love of the music or is there more to me?
Do I want these niggas to worship me?
False prophets

[Chorus]
Somebody shoulda told me it would be like this
Be like this, be like this
Somebody shoulda told me it would be like this, be like this
False prophets (La-la-la-la-la-la, la-la-la')
Somebody shoulda told me it would be like this
Be like this, be like this
Somebody shoulda told me it would be like this
Yeah, false prophets

[Verse 3]
These rappers insecure
They talk about being a man so much
I finally understand that they ain't even sure
'Bout who they are and why they do this
Guess I'm included in that category as a nigga who done had the glory
My highest moments come from tellin' all the saddest stories
I've seen in my life, I be fiendin' to write
Songs that raise the hair on my arms
My lowest moments came from tryin' too hard
To impress some niggas that couldn't care if I'm on
Therefore from here on out, my hair grow out
I care nothin' 'bout opinions
I wanna give hope like the fountains you throw pennies in
Hit the store, take your diss, make your wish
This is dedicated to the ones that listen to me on some faithful shit
I'm on some thankful shit
But the real God is in you, not the music you coppin'
I hear my old shit and know I can top it
False prophets

[Chorus]
Somebody shoulda told me it would be like this
Be like this, be like this
Somebody shoulda told me it would be like this, be like this
False prophets (La-la-la-la-la-la, la-la-la')
Somebody shoulda told me it would be like this
Be like this, be like this
Somebody shoulda told me it would be like this
Yeah, false prophets

[Intro: Choir & J. Cole]
I'm a born sinner
But I die better than that, I swear
It's way darker this time
*Laughs*

[Chorus: J. Cole & The Notorious B.I.G.]
Sometimes I brag like Hov
Born sinner, the opposite of a winner
Sometimes I brag like Hov
Born sinner, the opposite of a winner
Sometimes I brag like Hov
Born sinner, the opposite of a winner
Sometimes I brag like Hov, now I'm in the limelight 'cause I rhyme tight
Cole, time to get paid, blow up like the World Trade

[Verse 1: J. Cole]
Sometimes I brag like Hov, sometimes I'm real like Pac
Sometimes I focus on the flow to show the skills I got
Sometimes I focus on the dough, look at these bills I got
This is a message for some rappers tryna steal my spot
You niggas famous on the internet, I'm real life hot, homie
Get your weight up, fake niggas get sprayed up
My verbal AK slay faggots
And I don't mean no disrespect whenever I say faggot, okay, faggot?
Uh, don't be so sensitive
If you want to get fucked in the ass that's between you and whoever else's dick it is
Pause, maybe that line was too far
Just a little joke to show how homophobic you are
And who can blame ya? Boy Meets World, I'm tryna find a new Topanga
And bang her out, no hanging out
My pops was club hopping back when Rick James was out
And all I get is Trinidad James, wait a minute, that's strange
Sip a bit of champagne, say fuck it
If the hoes like it I love it, nigga, nigga, nigga
Used to watch Rap City, Big Tigga, Tigga
Rap nerd, even copped Rah Diggah, Diggah
Pac had a nigga saying fuck Jigga, fuck Biggie
I was only like 11 so forgive me
A decade later I'd be all up in the city
Tryna get Hov to fuck with me
With a burned CD full of jams that was up in my hand
When he said he didn't want it it was fuck him again
One day, he gon' regret playing me
Little did I know in a year he'd be fucking paying me, what could you say to me? I
Beat the odds like Vegas, I used to rap about haters
Before niggas was hating me, now they hate to see
A young black man with a college degree
Fucking all these little models for free, pardon me

[Chorus: J. Cole & The Notorious B.I.G.]
Sometimes I brag like Hov
Born sinner, the opposite of a winner
Sometimes I brag like Hov
Born sinner, the opposite of a winner
Sometimes I brag like Hov
Born sinner, the opposite of a winner
Sometimes I brag like Hov
Got the game back, and I ain't ever letting go

[Verse 2: J. Cole]
I'm the prince of the city, I studied Machiavelli
You niggas couldn't blow with C4 strapped to your belly
I snuck up out the parts where niggas be living heartless
And cannot tell the difference between Iraqi, Israeli
And so I'm wondering really what could you actually tell me
I'm tryna keep my homie from throwing crack in the skully
So, back with this pen to give back for my sins
Took a black president to tell the Japanese sorry
But who the fuck gon' tell my niggas sorry
Never seen his pops 'cause he's sorry
Fucked up education, would ask for reparations
But I'm probably just gon' go and buy Ferraris, vroom
Please forgive him
According to the preacher man he needs Jesus in him
But the Devil run the T.V. so the demons in 'em
I'm in trouble
Did a deal with the Devil, now I'm pleading with him
Like give me my soul

[Bridge: J. Cole]
My nigga, I ain't ever letting you go again
I ain't ever letting go
I ain't ever letting you go again
Please give me my soul
I ain't ever letting go
I ain't ever letting you go again
Please give me my soul
I ain't ever letting go
But the Devil don't play fair

[Refrain: J. Cole]
I'm 'bout to go and join the Illuminati
Fuck everybody
I'm 'bout to go and join the Illuminati
Fuck everybody
I'm 'bout to go and join the Illuminati
Fuck everybody
I'm 'bout to go and join the Illuminati

[Verse 3: J. Cole]
These next three bars is dedicated to the retards
Keep on asking me about the Illuminati;
Is you stupid, nigga? Young black millionaire
Old white billionaires, I'm sure that they can do without me
And I ain't really into sacrificing human bodies
Couple more A's I would've been a summa cuma laude
Beyonc' told me that she want to cop the blue Bugatti
That shit is more than what I'm worth, I think she knew it probably
Well this is awkward, awkward
Want to know what else is really awkward, awkward
When niggas buy rings for bitches I had flings with
I'm praying I don't see 'em at the Oscars, Oscars

[Interlude: J. Cole]
Hey J. Cole, this way, hey
Oh, hey, what's up? What's goin' on with you? Okay
Big smile, man, big smile, let me see that crooked smile
J. Cole, J. Cole, this way, look this way
Oh friend hug, friend hug, just keep it friendly
We friends, friends

[Verse 4: J. Cole]
Re-adjustin' my target audience, 'cause it's obvious
I've gone astray, losing my way like Timberlake
Produced by Timbaland on that goddamn FutureSex/LoveSounds
What's playing in my mind, just the sound of my whole career
Crash and burning, the thing that I mostly fear
Was on track for the first two years until I let the Devil steer
Now what have we here? Mask my tears, but I

[Bridge: J. Cole, Yolanda DeBerry & Tanikka Myers]
I ain't ever letting go
I ain't ever letting you go again
I ain't ever letting go
I ain't ever letting you go again
I ain't ever letting go
I ain't ever letting you go again
I ain't ever letting go
I ain't ever letting you go again

[Outro: J. Cole & The Notorious B.I.G.]
Allow me to re-introduce myself, my name is Cole
My nigga
Born sinner, the opposite of a winner
Sometimes I brag like Hov
Allow me to re-introduce myself, my name is Cole
My nigga
Born sinner, the opposite of a winner
Sometimes I brag like Hov
Born sinner

[Intro]
I never felt so alive
I never felt so alive
I never felt so alive (I never felt so alive)
I never felt so alive (I never felt so alive)

[Interlude]
Catch me, don't you'
Catch me, don't you catch me
I've fallen in love for the first time
I wanna cry
And I ain't even tryna fight it
Don't wanna die (Don't wanna die no more)
'Cause now you're here and I just wanna be
Right by your side
On any night that you be crying, baby
I'll dry your eyes
I'll dry your eyes

[Verse]
Every time you go to sleep you look like you in Heaven
Plus the head game is stronger than a few Excedrin
You shine just like the patent leather on my new 11's
You read me like a book like I'm the Bible, you the Reverend
Yeah, I wanna tell the truth to you
I wanna talk about my days as a youth to you
Exposing you to all my demons and the reasons I'm this way
I would like to paint a picture, but it'll take more than a day
It would take more than some years to get all over all my fears
Preventing me from letting you see all of me perfectly clear
The same wall that's stopping me from letting go and shedding tears
From the lack of having father, and the passing of my peers
While I'm too scared to expose myself
It turns out, you know me better than I know myself
Better than I know myself
Well how 'bout that?

[Outro]
She gets him (you get me)
She hugs him (you kiss me)
You tell me you miss me
And I believe you, I believe you
She gets him (you get me)
She hugs him (you kiss me)
You tell me you miss me
And I believe you, I believe you
Catch me, don't you'
Catch me, don't you catch me
I've fallen in love for the first time

[Intro: J. Cole]
Yeah
Hey

[Verse 1: J. Cole]
Spinning in circles, live my life without rehearsal
If I died today my nigga, was it business, was it personal?
Should this be my last breath I'm blessed cause it was purposeful
Never got to church to worship lord but please be merciful
You made me versatile, well-rounded like cursive
Know you chose me for a purpose, I put my soul in these verses
Born sinner, was never born to be perfect
Sucker for women licking they lips and holding these purses
Back when we ran the streets who would think we'd grow to be murderers
Teachers treated niggas as if they totally worthless
And violent, and hopeless, I saw but never noticed
That a college point us right to "Be all that you can be" posters, uh
Rest in peace to Tiffany, I don't know if
This the realest shit I wrote, but know the realest nigga wrote this
And signed it, and sealed it in a envelope and knew one day you'll find it
And knew one day you'd come back and rewind it, singing

[Chorus: James Fauntleroy]
I'm a born sinner
But I'll die better than that, I swear
You were always where I needed you to be
Whether you were there or not there (I was there)
I was born sinning
But I live better than that (better than that)
If you ain't fucking with that, I don't care
(Ooh, ooh, ooh) Yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse 2: J. Cole]
Yeah, this music shit is a gift
But God help us make it 'cause this music bizz is a cliff
I got her life in my grip, she holding tight to my wrist
She screaming: "Don't let me slip"
She see the tears in my eyes, I see the fear on her lips
True when I told you: "You the only reason why I don't flip
And go insane"; My roof in the pouring rain
You knew me before the fame, don't lose me the more I change, no
Just grow with me, go broke you go broke with me
I smoke you gon' smoke with me
Woman's curse since birth, man lead her to the hearse
I go Bobby you go Whitney damn
Listen here, I'll tell you my biggest fears
You the only one who knows 'em
Don't you ever go expose 'em
This life is harder than you'll probably ever know
Emotions I hardly ever show, more for you than for me
Don't you worry yourself, I gotta do this for me
They tell me life is a test, but where's the tutor for me?
Pops came late, I'm already stuck in my ways
Ducking calls from my mother for days
Sometimes she hate the way she raised me but she love what she raised
Can't wait to hand her these house keys with nothing to say
Except

[Chorus: James Fauntleroy]
I'm a born sinner
But I'll die better than that, I swear
You were always where I needed you to be
Whether you were there or not there (I was there)
I was born sinning
But I live better than that (better than that)
If you ain't fucking with that, I don't care
(Ooh, ooh, ooh) Yeah, yeah, yeah

[Chorus: Choir]
I'm a born sinner
But I'll die better than that, I swear
You were always where I needed you to be
Whether you were there or not there (I was there)
I was born sinning
But I live better than that (better than that)
If you ain't fucking with that, I don't care
(Ooh, ooh, ooh) Yeah, yeah, yeah

[Outro: J. Cole]
This shit is a gift

[Verse 1: J. Cole]
Baby, you summertime fine
I let you get on top, I be the underline, I'm
Tryna get beside you like the number nine, dime
You fine as hell
I guess I met you for a reason, only time can tell
But well, I'm wonderin' what type of shit you wantin'
Do you like the finer things or you a simple woman?
Would you drink with a nigga? Do you smoke weed?
Don't be ashamed, it ain't no thing, I used to blow trees
Gettin' lifted, I quit but shit, I might get high with you
It's only fittin' 'cause I'm lookin' super fly with you
A flower, you are powerful, you do somethin' to me
'Cause girl, I caught the vibe like you threw somethin' to me
So I threw 'em back, now all my niggas hollerin', 'Who was that?'
'Oh boy, she bad nigga, what you 'bout to do with that?'
I'm finna take you home, just sip a little Patron
Now we zonin', baby you so fine

[Chorus: J. Cole]
And can I hit it in the mornin'?
Can I hit it in the mornin'?
And can I hit it in the mornin'?
The Sun risin' while you moanin'
And can I hit it in the mornin'?
Can I hit it in the mornin'?
And can I hit it in the mornin'?
The Sun risin' while you moanin'

[Verse 2: Drake]
Uh, baby, you wintertime cold
The night is still young, drink that dinner wine slow
I'm tryna make the goosebumps on your inner thigh show
I'll let you beat me there as far as finish lines go
Yeah, and if you gotta leave for work
I'll be right here in the same bed that you left me in
I love thick women 'cause my aunt she rode equestrian
I used to go to the stables and get them kids to bet me
And I would always ride the stallions whenever she let me
I'm jokin', I mean that thing is pokin'
I mean you kinda like that girl that's in the US Open
I mean I got this hidden agenda that you provokin'
I got bath water that you can soak in, things I could do with lotion
Don't need a towel, we could dry off in the covers
And when you think you like it, I promise you gonna love it
Yeah, when lights comin' through the drapes and we both yawnin'
I roll over and ask if I can hit it in the mornin'

[Chorus: Drake]
Yeah, can I hit it in the mornin'?
Yeah, can I hit it in the mornin'?
Yeah, the Sun risin' while you moanin', baby
Can I hit it in the mornin', uh?
Can I hit it in the mornin', yeah?
Can I hit it in the mornin'?
The Sun risin' while you moanin'

[Verse 3: J. Cole]
Hey, God bless the child that can hold his own
God bless the woman that can hold Patron
God bless her homegirl that drove us home
No strings attached like a cordless phone
You see my intentions with you was clear
I'm learnin' not to judge a woman by the shit that she wear
Therefore you shouldn't judge a nigga off the shit that you hear
Get all defensive, apprehensive, all because my career
To be fair, I know we barely know each other and yeah
Somehow I wound up in your bed so where we headed from here?
Just say you're scared if you're scared
But if you through frontin', we can do somethin'
And you know just what I'm talkin' about
Tomorrow you'll be callin' out
'Cause tonight we gettin' right into the wee morn'
Cook a nigga breakfast after sex is like a reward
Then I go my own way, you think about me all day
That's just a warnin'

[Chorus: J. Cole]
And can I hit it in the mornin'?
Can I hit it in the mornin'?
Can I hit it in the mornin'?
The Sun risin' while you moanin'
Can I hit it in the mornin'?
Can I hit it in the mornin'?
And can I hit it in the mornin'?
The Sun risin' while you moanin', yeah

[Intro]
Uh-uh, uh-uh
One, two, one, two, one, two, one, two, yeah
Uh-uh, uh-uh
One, two, one, two, one, two, one, two, yeah
Uh

[Verse 1]
Baby girl, I can't imagine what it's like for you
I got you pregnant, now inside there is a life in you
I know you wonderin' if this is gon' make me think 'bout wifin' you
Like, if you have my first child
Would I spend my whole life with you?
Now, I ain't tryna pick a fight with you, I'm tryna talk
Now, I ain't tryna spend the night with you, I'm kinda lost
See, I've been givin' it some thought lately
And frankly I feel like we ain't ready and this'
Hold up now, let me finish!
Think about it, baby, me and you, we still kids ourself
How we gonna raise a kid by ourself?
Handle biz by ourself? A nigga barely over twenty
Where the hell we gon' live? Where am I gon' get that money?
I refuse to bring my boy or my girl in this world
When I ain't got shit to give 'em, and I'm not with them niggas
Who be knockin' girls up and skate out
So, girl, you gotta think about how the options weigh out
What's the way out?
Uh

[Hook]
And I ain't too proud to tell you
That I cry sometime, I cry sometimes about it
And girl, I know it hurt, but if this world was perfect
Then we could make it work, but I doubt it
And I ain't too proud to tell you
That I cry sometime, I cry sometimes about it
And girl, I know it hurt, but if this world was perfect
Then we could make it work, but I doubt it

[Verse 2]
She said: "Nigga, you got some nerve
To come up to me talkin' about abortion
This my body, nigga, so don't think you finna force shit!
See, I knew that this is how you act, so typical
Said you love me, oh, but now you flippin' like reciprocals
It figures though, I should've known
That you was just another nigga
No different from them other niggas
Who be claimin' that they love you just to get up in them drawers
Knowin' all the right things to say
I let you hit it raw, mothafucka!
Now I'm pregnant, you don't wanna get involved, mothafucka?
Tryna take away a life'is you God, mothafucka?!
I don't think so! This a new life up in my stomach
Regardless if I'm your wife, this new life here, I'ma love it
I ain't budgin', I just do this by my mothafuckin' self
See, my mama raised me without no mothafuckin' help
From a man, but I still don't understand how you could say that
Did you forget all those conversations that we had way back
'Bout your father? And you told me that you hate that nigga
Talkin' about he a coward and you so glad that you ain't that nigga
'Cause he left your mama when she had you and he ain't shit
And here you go doin' the same shit' You ain't shit, nigga!"

[Hook]
And I ain't too proud to tell you
That I cry sometimes, I cry sometimes about it
And boy, this shit hurts, and ain't nobody perfect
Still we can make it work, but you doubt it
And I ain't too proud to tell you
That I cry sometimes, I cry sometimes about it
And boy, this shit hurts, and ain't nobody perfect
Still we can make it work, but you doubt it

[Verse 3]
They say everything happens for a reason
And people change like the seasons, then grow apart
She wanted him to show his heart and say he loved her
He spoke the magic words and on the same day he fucked her
Now she wide open
She'd put a ring up on his finger if she could
But he loved her 'cause the pussy good
But she ain't no wife though
Uh-oh! She tellin' him she missed her period, like typos
He panickin', froze up like a mannequin, a life grows
Inside her, and now he askin': "Is it even mine?"
What if this bitch ain't even pregnant? Dog, could she be lyin'?
And she be cryin', 'cause he actin' distant
Like, "Ever since I told you this, nigga, you actin' different."
And all his niggas sayin', "Man, these hoes be trappin' niggas
Playin' with niggas' emotions like they some action figures."
Swear they get pregnant for collateral, it's like extortion
Man, if that bitch really pregnant, tell her to get a abortion (Uh)
But what about your seed, nigga? (Uh-uh)
But what about your seed, nigga?
But what about your seed, nigga?
But what about your seed, nigga?

[Outro]
And I ain't too proud to tell you
That I cry sometime, I cry sometimes about it
And I ain't too proud to tell you
That I cry sometime, I cry sometimes about it

[Intro]
Yeah, we back
Back in Mohammed crib, nigga, top floor
The back room with just the one little small window, nigga
The light be comin' through it in the morning
Old-ass walls and shit
But it's just like I remember, just like I wanted it
Yeah, I'm workin'
Yeah, I'm workin', nigga

[Verse]
Look, it's the return of the Mr. Burn Suckers
Not herpes infested, just perfectly blessed with
A style that you can't F with, protection recommended
'Cause Cole the definition of a weapon that can end it
You know, mass destruction when I mash the button
I take your favorite major rapper, left him independent
Cryin' in the corner
'Cause I ain't into sorta kinda, dissin' niggas
I'm borderline addicted to slaughter
Line up niggas in order
Of who you think can really fuck with me most
Then I tuck the heat close, if he don't duck then he ghost
Ain't no need for discussion
If they weren't talkin' 'bout the bread these motherfuckers be toast
Clap at the fake deep rappers
The OG gatekeep rappers
The would-you-take-a-break-please rappers
Bunch of words and ain't sayin' shit, I hate these rappers
Especially the amateur eight week rappers
Lil' whatever ' just another short bus rapper
Fake drug dealers turn tour bus trappers
Napoleon complex, you this tall rappers
Get exposed standin' next to 6'4" rappers
The streets don't fuck with you, you Pitchfork rappers
Chosen by the white man, you hit store rappers
I reload the clip, then I hit more rappers with that
Straight shittin' on these piss-poor rappers, I'm back
Never knew a nigga that was better
Revenue, I'm good at gettin' cheddar
Reminisce on days I didn't eat
If it's meant to be, then it'll be
If it's not, then fuck it, I'ma try
Ain't no need to ask the Father why, no
'Cause one day everybody gotta die
One day everybody gotta die, oh
One day everybody gotta die
One day everybody gotta die, my nigga, my nigga

[Chorus]
Fell in love through photograph
I don't even know your name
Wonder if you'd follow back
I hope to see you one day
I won't show my niggas now
I'II keep this one for myself
Love today's gone digital
And it's messing with my health

[Verse 1]
Yeah
Damn, I love your sense of humor
You don't get caught up in rumors
You don't be talking 'bout who fuckin' who
And I notice the way you maneuver
Sexy, but never show too much
Ain't heard from you in like two months
All of a sudden, you pop on my line
You could make time, stop on a dime
I think you mastered the art of sublime
Your type is harder to find
You could turn water to wine, yeah
You could turn water to wine, yeah
I think you mastered the art of sublime
Your type is harder to find
You could turn water to wine, yeah
You could turn water to wine, feel me

[Verse 2]
Yeah
Feel like I gotta say somethin'
Thought of you got my heart jumpin'
But I can't come up with nothin' (no)
But I can't come up with nothin'
I put it off for a day
I come back around your way
Searching for what I could say
That accurately could convey
The way that I feel in the word
That's different than what you done heard
So many done hit you wit game
So many been sent to the curb
And I did not come here to play
And I did not come to observe
And I did not come here to play
But I did not come to observe
Feel me

[Intro: Mike Epps (Sampled)]
Married men act totally different when they're by themselves, don't they? You see 'em with their wife, "What's up Tony?" "Hey man, how's everything going brother? Oh, just taking it easy, hanging out with the old lady. Alright, God bless you, take it easy now, alright." You be like that nigga ain't like that
You see him by himself, "What's up Tony?" "Hey, where's the bitches at, nigga?! Where's the bitches?!"

[Verse 1]
Yeah
Gimme my space, Lord, ain't enough time to chase
All these dreams, nah mean? I got no time to wait
Love my girl, but I told her straight up, "Don't wait up"
Stumble home late, I'm drunk, we fucked and made up
Used to living free as a bird, but now I'm laid up
Feelin' like a nigga got handcuffs on
How the fuck did my life become a damn love song?
She ride for a nigga and she stand up for him
But a nigga wan' be a nigga, be a nigga
Ride through the streets with freaks and real niggas
She'll never understand what it's like to be a man
Knowin' when you look inside yourself you see a nigga
And you don't wan' let her down
But you too young for the settle down
And maybe you can thug it out, learn what is love about
When you can't live with her and you can't live without
Aw shit, goddamn, I think the devil got his hands on me
Stripper saying, "Baby, won't you throw them bands on me?"
And I came to spend
She pop a molly, let the motherfuckin' games begin
I'm running away

[Chorus]
Runaway, runaway
Runaway, runaway
I'm holdin' on
Desperately
Runaway, runaway
Runaway, runaway
I'm holdin' on

[Verse 2]
When it's all said and done everybody dies
In this life ain't no happy endings
Only pure beginnings followed by years of sinning and fake repentance
The preacher say we were made in image of Lord
To which I replied: "Are you sure?
Even a murderer? Even a whore?
Even a nigga running through bitches on tour
With a good girl at home folding clothes and shit?"
She losin' faith in him and he knows the shit, like, "What the fuck is a break?
Don't know how much I can take no more
I give you all I got 'til it ain't no more
No more tears, it's been ten long years
Damn near, I don't know if I can wait no more"
And who can blame her, you complain about
Every time you out, you come back she poutin'
Sleeping back to back, this is whack, we 'bout
To go platinum and I'm in the crib acting out
My childhood fantasies of wife and home
But it's a whole lot of actresses I'd like to bone
And despite the rumors you hold out
On account of your guilt and she has got to spend her nights alone
And she ride or die like Eve and 'em
Make home-cooked meals every evenin'
And even in your lowest days
When you're no longer Superman, at least you know you got Lois Lane
But you

[Chorus]
Runaway, runaway
Runaway, runaway
I'm holdin' on
Desperately
Runaway, runaway
Runaway, runaway
I'm holdin' on

[Verse 3]
Yeah
Unbelievable, seen evil that not even Knievel know
At age three I knew this world was three below
Listen, even though my ego low, achieved the unachievable
Imagine if my confidence was halfway decent yo
This just in, fucked more bitches than Bieber though
Still I keep it low, got my niggas on the need to know
Basis, my manager back in the days was racist
I was a young boy, passing skates and tucking laces
Old perverted white man who told me, "Jermaine
It's all pink on the inside, fuck what color they face is"
Wise words from an indecent man
Made me reflect on the times when we was three-fifths of them
In chains and powerless, brave souls reduced to cowardice
Slaving in the baking sun for hours just
To see the master creep into the shack where your lady at
Nine months later got a baby, that's
Not quite what you expected, but you
Refuse to neglect it, 'cause you
Know your wifey loves you, thus you refuse to accept it
That's the type of shit that turned my granny light-skinned
Rich white men rule the nation still
Only difference is we all slaves now, the chains concealed
In our thoughts, if I follow my heart to save myself
Could I run away from fifty-mill like Dave Chappelle?
You know

[Chorus]
Runaway, runaway
Runaway, runaway
I'm holdin' on
Desperately
Runaway, runaway
Runaway, runaway
I'm holdin' on

[Intro: J. Cole]
Cole World, Southside
Can't get enough, can't get enough
Eastside, Westside, worldwide, ride out

[Verse 1: J. Cole]
Now, I ain't got no kids yet, but this right here's for practice
I hate to get the seats in the Benz wet
But that's how good your ass is
Make an old man get his glasses, make Wesley pay his taxes
Then follow your moves all week on Twitter
Probably make a gay nigga reconsider
You now rockin' with the best, mane
Dress game down to the sex game
Won't brag, but the boy been blessed, mane
Let you play with the stick; Ovechkin
She callin', she textin', she's fallin', but let me explain
Gotta tell your old boyfriend skate, girl
'Cause a nigga don't play them ex games
Nope! Straight sexing, no handcuff or arresting
And I ain't coming off of my last name
'Cause I really can't take no stressing
'Bout where I done been, who I done hit
Your homegirl saying, 'He a bad boy.'
But I'm signed to the Roc
No time for the gossip, bitch, put down them tabloids!

[Hook: Trey Songz]
She said, 'I heard you got a main chick
A mistress and some hoes
You be up to no good, and everybody knows
My homegirls tried to warn me, they tried to let me know
But what you got, I need a lot, so I can't let you go.'

[Hook: J. Cole]
She said, 'I can't get enough, can't get enough' (I need that)
'I can't get enough, can't get enough' (I need that)
'I can't get enough of what you got
Good God, you hit the spot
Tried to let go, but I just could not
So don't you stop, I need that.'

[Verse 2: J. Cole]
Hey, Globetrotter, Cole hotter
Even way out in London town
Hoes holla, 'cause they love my sound
And I got love for the underground
Kweli, Pimp C, H-Town where Bun get down
Met a bad bitch that'll cut all night
That'll suck all night, you just cut off lights
Almost missed my flight
Tryna get my last little nut, all right?
She be down for whatever
Whenever I wanna get up in the guts, all right?
Never fuss or fight
On the grind, tryna find this lettuce
I love it when you give me head
I hate it when you give me headaches

[Hook: Trey Songz]
She said, 'I heard you got a main chick
A mistress and some hoes
You be up to no good, and everybody knows
My homegirls tried to warn me, they tried to let me know
But what you got, I need a lot, so I can't let you go.'

[Hook: J. Cole]
She said, 'I can't get enough, can't get enough' (I need that)
'I can't get enough, can't get enough' (I need that)
'I can't get enough of what you got
Good God, you hit the spot
Tried to let go, but I just could not
So don't you stop, I need that.'

[Verse 3:  J. Cole]
Hey, Cole World, baby, ain't nothin' sunny
I see 'em hating, but it ain't nothin' to me
I'm from the Ville, where they bang for the money
And carry fo'-fives, like change for a twenty
So what I look like, scurred?
Them niggas over there look like nerds
Never mind that, girl, let's make a track
I'll beat the pussy up, that's the hook right thurr
That's the hook right thurr! That's the hook right thurr!
Never mind that, girl, let's make a track
I'll beat the pussy up, that's the hook right thurr

[Hook: Trey Songz]
She said, 'I heard you got a main chick
A mistress and some hoes
You be up to no good, and everybody knows
My homegirls tried to warn me, they tried to let me know
But what you got, I need a lot, so I can't let you go.'

[Hook: J. Cole]
She said, 'I can't get enough, can't get enough' (I need that)
'I can't get enough, can't get enough' (I need that)
'I can't get enough of what you got
Good God, you hit the spot
Tried to let go, but I just could not
So don't you stop, I need that.'

[Intro]
Yeah, uh-huh

[Verse 1]
This the shit I used to roll down Lewis Street with
Lord, know some hoes from the past
Like, "Damn Cole, wish I knew that you would be rich"
Well, shoulda asked
It's funny how these niggas on some real "be cool with me" shit
I bag two bitches like it's two of me, bitch
This the shit I used to roll down Lewis Street with
Finally got my own bedroom in this bitch
No more sleeping in my brother room
Like, "Man, I might as well be sleeping in my mother room"
'Cause how I'm supposed to sneak hoes with my bro here?
Plus she gon' find out I been rocking all his old gear
This his flow here, this is no fair, this is so pure
This is so clear, this is one breath, this is no air
Ain't no wedding but I do the most here
I'm the President, you the co-chair
You the player, yeah, I'm the coach here, nigga, I coast here
This weather got me set up on this West Coast, yeah
Avoiding the snakes, AKs, and coke, yeah
Get my dick wet but I never let it soak there
Man, I been thinkin' 'bout movin' out
What? Country boy in the city
Of New York nine years, ran that shit like Diddy
Riding through South Side Queens like Fiddy

[Chorus]
Nothing's impossible
And all you lame niggas show me what not to do
I met a real bad bitch in the club tonight
She told me, "Watch the snakes 'cause they watching you"
I told her, "Awww baby don't start!
I ain't looking for the way to your heart!"
She said, "You 'bout to miss church" while she riding me
I like my sundaes with a cherry on top
Make that ass drop (drop, drop)
Hey make that ass drop (drop, drop)
Hey make that ass drop (drop, drop)
Hey make that ass drop (drop, drop, drop)

[Verse 2]
Now if you only had one wish is it devious?
'Cause you already know who your genie is
Ain't get a cover now your mag on my penis
Like damn, he turned out to be a genius
Damn, real shit nigga, no Pixar
You niggas soft like Meagan Good's lips are
My kicks hard, my whip hard
I came out the womb with my dick hard
Back when I was playing Stomp the Yard
It'd be a bunch of niggas up on campus talking hard
Don't get exposed to these hoes boy, knock it off
I seen your mama in the Benz when she dropped you off
Damn, now who more thorough than me?
I paint a picture of my pain for the world to see
Could paint a picture of the game but my girl would see
Gotta ask myself, "What mean the world to me?"
Me, me

[Chorus]
Nothing's impossible
And all you lame niggas show me what not to do
I met a real bad bitch in the club tonight
She told me, "Watch the snakes 'cause they watching you"
I told her, "Aw baby don't start!
I ain't looking for the way to your heart!"
She said, "You bout to miss church" while she riding me
I like my sundaes with a cherry on top
Make that ass drop (drop, drop)
Make that ass drop
Hey make that ass drop (drop, drop)
Make that ass drop
Hey make that ass drop (drop, drop)
Make that ass drop
Hey make that ass drop
Make that ass drop

[Interlude]
Make, hey, make that ass drop (drop)
Hey, you seen me in this every damn day (drop)
It got the dick hard as a rock (drop)
And I can't control (Let it rock)
Hehe, control

[Verse 3]
This the shit I used to roll down Lewis Street wit'
Yeah
This the shit I used to roll down Lewis Street wit'
A little Fayettenam nigga out in Beverly Hills
That's when I ran into this chick I went to college with
Yeah, back when a nigga was on scholarship
Was in a rush but I still stopped to holla, shit
That's the least I owed her 'cause see I tried to hit
On the first night, and nah, I ain't proud of it
I boned her in my dorm room and kicked her out of it
And I never called back, how thoughtfulless
Now I'm standing in the streets tryna politic with her
In her mind she calling me a misogynist, nigga
On some Bobby Brown shit, my prerogative, nigga
Is to hit and never commit
Not realizing when I hit she never forgets
So every time I ignore the telephone call
Saying I'll hit her back knowing I'm never gon' call, she was hurting
Now she's staring dead in my face, she was smirking
Like, "Yeah, I remember and nah you ain't worth shit, nigga
You ain't worth shit, nigga"

[Outro]
Hm, this the shit I used to roll down Lewis Street with

It may seem like our fire
Has been a little burnt out, we're tired
We only need to stay close, in time
Sparks will fly
And we fly too, and we, and we
And we fly too
It may seem like our fire
Has been a little burnt out, we're tired
We only need to stay close, in time
Sparks will fly
And we fly too, and we, and we
And we fly too

[Verse 1: J. Cole]
Baby you deserve the whole enchilada
Gucci and Prada
Toast to the days when I didn't have a dollar
You stuck around even when the world frowned on me
Kicked me when I was down, and so they clowned on me
Down for me, my homie
You better believe, I know your home girl said you should leave a note
Know you was tired like the Michelin man
What if Gina would have listened to Pam?
Now they hate to see us last this long
When they get my album, probably pass this song
Thought they knew me well
Money can't buy you happiness that's true as hell
But happiness can't buy yo' ass this new SL
I love you like the fat kid loves cakes and shit
I love you like the bad kid love breakin' shit
Ride or die chick, fighting insecurities
Want a ring and my last name for securities

[Hook: Jhen' Aiko and J. Cole]
It may seem like our fire
Has been a little burnt out, we're tired
We only need to stay close, in time
Sparks will fly
And we fly too, and we, and we
And we fly too
It may seem like our fire
Has been a little burnt out, we're tired
We only need to stay close, in time
Sparks will fly
And we fly too, and we, and we
And we fly too

[Verse 2: J. Cole]
I know my style ain't perfect
I know my smile ain't perfect
Nigga ain't perfect, it's true
Funny though I am perfect for you
All the drama seem worth it for you
She put up with the shit like she work at the zoo, true
Now what you crying for?
She says you ain't gon' settle down, what you lyin' for?
She want that old thing back
Things ain't the same, think we both seen that
Love is war, end up on the floor
But baby you only lose when you don't swing back
I say those words hoping that
You fight for a nigga like I fight for you
Like I fight temptations every night for you
And know I slip, only girl in my life is you

[Hook: Jhen' Aiko and J. Cole]
It may seem like our fire
Has been a little burnt out, we're tired
We only need to stay close, in time
Sparks will fly
And we fly too, and we, and we

It may seem like our fire
Has been a little burnt out, we're tired
We only need to stay close, in time
Sparks will fly
And we fly too, and we, and we
And we fly too

[Bridge: Jhen' Aiko]
Feels as though our world's crashing down
We can't forget to breathe through this now
We live through the ups and the downs
It'll get better

[Hook: Jhen' Aiko]
It may seem like our fire
Has been a little burnt out, we're tired
We only need to stay close, in time
Sparks will fly

[Chorus: kiLL edward]
I got thoughts, can't control
Got me down, got me low
Rest my mind, rest my soul
When I blow, when I blow
Am I wrong, let them know
Feels so right to let things go
Don't think twice, this is me
This is how I should be

[Bridge: J. Cole]
But I'm aggravated without it
My saddest days are without it
My Saturdays are the loudest
I'm blowing strong
Some niggas graduated to powder
I dabble later, I doubt it
My database of narcotics
It's growing long
But I'm aggravated without it
My saddest days are without it
My Saturdays are the loudest
I'm blowing strong
Some niggas graduated to powder
I dabble later, I doubt it
My database of narcotics
It's growing long

[Verse: J. Cole]
I wrote this shit to talk about the word addiction
To my niggas --- I hope you listening
--- and ---, I hope you listening
This is for the whole fucking Ville, I hope you're listening
Smoking medical grade, but I ain't got prescription
All the way in Cali where they ain't got precipi-
-tation, feeling like the only one that made it
And I hate it for my niggas 'cause they ain't got ambition
Fuck did you expect, you can blame it on condition
Blame it on crack, you can blame it on the system
Blame it on the fact that 12 got jurisdiction
To ride around in neighborhoods that they ain't ever lived in
Blame it on the strain that you feel when daddy missing
Blame it on Trump shit, blame it on Clinton
Blame it on trap music and the politicians
Or the fact that every black boy wanna be Pippen
But they only got 12 slots on the Pistons
Blame it on the rain, Milli Vanilli with the disk skip
What I'm tryna say is the blame can go deep as seas
Just to blame 'em all I would need like twenty CD's
There's all sorts of trauma from drama that children see
Type of shit that normally would call for therapy
But you know just how it go in our community
Keep that shit inside it don't matter how hard it be
Fast forward, them kids is grown and they blowing trees
And popping pills due to chronic anxiety
I been saw the problem but stay silent 'cause I ain't Jesus
This ain't no trial if you desire go higher please
But fuck that now I'm older I love you 'cause you my friend
Without the drugs I want you be comfortable in your skin
I know you so I know you still keep a lot of shit in
You running from yourself and you buying product again
I know you say it helps and no I'm not trying to offend
But I know depression and drug addiction don't blend
Reality distorts and then you get lost in the wind
And I done seen the combo take niggas off the deep end
One thing about your demons they bound to catch up one day
I'd rather see you stand up and face them than run away
I understand this message is not the coolest to say
But if you down to try it I know of a better way
Meditate

[Pre-Chorus: J. Cole]
Meditate, meditate, meditate, meditate
Don't medicate, medicate, don't medicate, medicate
Meditate, meditate, meditate, meditate
Don't medicate, medicate, don't medicate, medicate

[Chorus: kiLL edward]
I got thoughts, can't control
Got me down, got me low
Rest my mind, rest my soul
When I blow, when I blow
Am I wrong, let them know
Feels so right to let things go
Don't think twice, this is me
This is how I should be

[Chorus]
That's my best friend, that's my best friend, flexin'
Big ol' booty bitch missus from Texas, what's next is
I'm gon' skeet off, lil' nigga come catch me, catch me
And that's my bestie, my bestie, my best friend, go best friend
Nigga livin' TTG and everything is still on fleek
Bad bitch rollin' wit' me, she gon' smile 'cause she on fleek
Hundred thousand dollars inside my pants, my shit on fleek
Hey-yeah! Yeah

[Verse 1]
Take them boys to school, swagonometry
Bitch I'm bleedin' bad, like a bumble bee
Hold up! Hold it, hold it, nigga proceed
I'ma eat that booty just like groceries
Eat on that coochie, lay that bitch down like "let's do it"
No Tiger, bitch, eat that wood, eat that wood
Supplier, bitch, I got pistols, no wood
I want them tacos that are Meagan Good
Helicopter choppin' with the buzz
Stuff them racks inside them if they nudge
Bang that other side, nigga curb
And my reefer louder than a speaker
Yeah my niece is hangin' with The Beatles
If you ever find her, better keep her
37 cameras for the sneakers
Goin' out like Ox or Beanie Sigel
Send a cop, I can't wait to mistreat 'em
Forcin' your ho, I can't wait to mislead 'em
And beat 'em, they ain't my people

[Chorus]
That's my best friend, that's my best friend, flexin'
Big ol' booty bitch missus from Texas, what's next is
I'm gon' skeet off, lil' nigga come catch me, catch me

Nigga livin' TTG and everything is still on fleek
Bad bitch rollin' wit' me, she gon' smile 'cause she on fleek
Hundred thousand dollars inside my pants, my shit on fleek
Hey-yeah! Yeah!

Let me tell you how I spent a couple hundreds today
I done cut back on that lean, I'm on that Hen' and D'uss'
Don't do no talkin', when you see him, you better shoot in his face
I got a hundred bitches that can't wait to replace

[Chorus: Travis Scott]
Me-meet me at The London
If you find time, we can run one
Talk about some things we can't undo
You just send the pin, I can find you
6'1", on the money, 9'2"
You just say the word and I'll run through
Two texts, no reply, that's when I knew
I knew, I knew, yeah, I knew

[Verse 1: J. Cole]
Yeah, circumnavigate the globe as the cash grows (Grow)
Get a nigga whacked like you get the grass mowed (Mowed)
I'm talkin' slick when I'm with the Big Slime, nigga (Slime)
Could hit your bitch, you could never hit mine, nigga (Mine)
In my DM, they electric slide, nigga (Huh, slide)
No catfishin', this is not a fish fry, nigga
Never switch sides on my dog
Catch a contact, hitch a ride, go to Mars
Everybody sing
How could you come up out your face
And say I ain't the hardest nigga you done ever heard?
I left a flock of rappers dead and buried
A verse from me is like eleven birds
Just did the math, that's like two thousand dollars every word
I'm on the verge, I'll beat the charge
I killed some niggas and I walked away from it
Then I observe, just how you curve
Then told the nigga that they gotta wait for it
"I know'I know you in high demand"
I'm ballin' on a pussy nigga like Juwanna Mann
I'm drownin' all inside the pussy like I never swam
Ayy, fuck your IG, I put somethin' on your sonogram
I'm the man, ayy, ayy

[Chorus: Travis Scott]
Me-meet me at The London
If you find time, we can run one
Talk about some things we can't undo

Two texts, no reply, that's when I knew
I knew, I knew, yeah, I knew

[Verse 2: Young Thug]
Pimp talk, church talk, I can make a brick walk (Woo)

She took a quarter and she fled (Uh)
I'm in the Lamb', so she gon' ride (Yeah)
I see the pain in shawty's light brown eyes (Ooh)
I'm at The London with some big thots
No fries, she eat steaks with the fish sides
Didn't your mama tell you when something on fire, stop, drop and roll? (Aw yeah)
I've been on the road like a pair of spinners at Stop-N-Go's (Yeah)
I could charge 'em like a Dodge Hemi Demon
Got your broad in the garage eatin' semen
Every time a nigga go back to the ward
Niggas act like they want start
And we leave them on the cement (Grra, grra)

[Chorus: Travis Scott]
Me-meet me at The London

Geeked out my mind, man, I'm tripping out

[Chorus]
Okay, cool, okay, bool, I love her

Every time I fuck I gotta hit me least like two bitches
Boy, that dope been whipped, you need like new wrists
Foreign car outside, that bitch got two digits
Money stand like eight feet just like two midgets

[Verse 1]
Who the fuck told you that Young Thugger Thugger don't fuck up the beat?

Stoner my lifestyle, I'm livin' too wild
I came to make you proud, that money keep her around
In love with her head, I can't turn it down
Can't wait for my time to come back around
She see that you don't got Lil Haiti's style

Balling in New York like a motherfucking Knick
You better have them racks, you ever want to hear me spit

Pussy nigga play, I'm coming back with the K

Bitches wanna see a nigga thumb through it fast
I'ma name myself Young Thug Attendant
Hundred bands at a time I fronted you bags, but you

All of my cups are muddy I fuck my bitches' buddies
I just want nut like Buddy, all of my bitches buddies
Panamera with the tinted roof
All the niggas dogs goin', "Roof"
Top notch shawty, nigga ring came with karats
Young nigga rich, jewelry colder than the attic
If she ain't a virgin, then that bitch is only average

I can't learn a bitch, but I learned mathematics
I just ball her down whenever she call my pattern

[Chorus]
Okay, cool, okay, bool, I love her

You know I'm a stoner, I love drugs and I can't never be tooken
And you can suck my banana, but I won't eat your pudding
So come a lil' closer, my bitch won't know ya

Hot, hot, hot, hot
Hot, hot, hot, hot
Hot, hot, hot, hot

[Chorus: Gunna]
Everything litty, I love when it's hot
Turned up the city, I broke off the notch
Got some more millis, I keep me a knot
I created history and made me a lot
He tried to diss me and ended on Fox
We call them chopsticks 'cause they gonna chop
Took her out of Follies 'cause her pussy pop
I run it like Nike, we got it on lock

[Verse 1: Gunna]
Cartier eye
I'm the bossman in a suit but no tie
I can't be sober, I gotta stay high
Pour me some syrup in a Canada Dry
Ridin' in the spaceship like Bonnie and Clyde
Don't worry, baby, I keep me some fire
Shenenehs and Birkins, she cannot decide
The latest Mercedes her go-to surprise
Don't sleep on miss lady, her pussy a prize
Dick in her back while I'm grippin' her sides
Bigger Maybach, this ain't regular size
We really fly, we like pelican glide
Bitch, you ain't slick, I can tell the disguise
Upgraded my wrist, put baguettes in that Sky
She sing, I might sign her and change her whole life
I told her to gargle and work on her highs

[Chorus: Gunna]
Everything litty, I love when it's hot
Turned up the city, I broke off the notch
Got some more millis, I keep me a knot
I created history and made me a lot
He tried to diss me and ended on Fox
We call them chopsticks 'cause they gonna chop
Took her out of Follies 'cause her pussy pop
I run it like Nike, we got it on lock

[Interlude: Young Thug]
Cash, money, checks, cash
Addy, Birkin, brand new extendos
I just wanna fuck the bitch by myself
I just passed her to the dawg like my Sprite

[Verse 2: Young Thug]
I took the Bentley coupe back, then I hopped in a Cayenne (Skrrt)
I put the bitch in the front of the Bentley, in front of the driver (Skrrt)
Ayy, man, this synthetic weed, you can't smoke in the Rolls Royce, woah, woah (Yeah, yeah)
I'm still double cupped up, I'm drinkin', I shoot off your tires, huh (Doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo)
I'm in the coupe by myself
I had to kick a door when I was 5
Keep the awards on the shelf
Whole sixteen round in the fire
I'm sick and tired of these young niggas act like they firin', they tellin' these lies
Actin' like they the ones created this and they get all the drip from my guys
Yeah, Cartier eyes
Cartier coat, Cartiers the watch
Cartier love, Cartier the thot
Cartier specs, buffalo on the side
Princess cut diamonds, they Cartier, yeah
Cartier bag for the Cartier thot
Sky Wrangler coupe with two hundred the dash
Cartier jeans, ain't no way I can sag
Ain't no way I'ma ever gon' go out bad
I can't go out, no way I'ma go out
I just grip on her ass and I show out
I sit like a champ and I wait on a hold-out
I just whip up a new Chanel Patek
I whip with the wrist and I don't break the door out
Turn the whole top floor to a whorehouse
Hundred racks in ones, dude brought the flood out

[Outro: Gunna]
Hot, hot, hot, hot
Hot, hot, hot, hot
Hot, hot, hot, hot, damn
Hot, hot, hot

You know I'm living like a G
These lil' niggas ain't gonna take nothin' from me

[Chorus: Trouble & Young Thug]
Like a thief in the night
I take anything but some pussy
She got that head like a dyke
She got that head that I like
Deep in your partner ain't right
Put that lil' babe on ice
I make the paper like rice
Head on that bucket, your mothafuckin' life, Skoob
I promise you don't know me
I pull up 'bout my cake
Where I'm from is not safe
I got fish, I'm a lake
Scoop them grits on a plate
Yet she thought it was steak
I'm a thief in the night
Make her ride like a bike

[Verse 1: Young Thug & Trouble]
I go down on a dyke, I go up on my price
I might drop Kimbo Slice, kidnap like Uncle Ice
I got grits at the beach and they white like a rice
Let Trouble take your life
After I give you five
Straight put that five to the side
It ain't no question how nigga gon' ride
When they come with them questions
My nigga get quiet, sh sh, nigga sit quiet, sh sh
I am not taking no disrespect
You Patrick Ewing, you pump fakin'
No that won't happen on me
I drop a key like the mufuckin' beat
I look good as your dad on a Friday
So many cars I gotta buy a driveway
Never gon' let 'em live a nigga crime day
Serving these X and P's instead of poppin'
Pockets fat up like they jumped 'em
YSL, that slimy anaconda
Bicking back, being bool like a uncle
I'm so geeked up I might fuck a condom

[Chorus: Trouble & Young Thug]
Like a thief in the night
I take anything but some pussy
She got that head like a dyke
She got that head that I like
Deep in your partner ain't right
Put that lil' babe on ice
I make the paper like Rice
Head on that bucket, your mothafuckin' life, Skoob
I promise you don't know me
I pull up 'bout my cake
Where I'm from is not safe
I got fish, I'm a lake
Scoop them grits on a plate
Yet she thought it was steak
I'm a thief in the night
Make her ride like a bike

[Verse 2: Trouble & Young Thug]
I get 'em all on the rice
She didn't even know what it was but she taste it
I dig in, her shit sound like Jason
I be on Percocets more than occasion
They betting on me like in Vegas
Betting on me like I'm Vegas
Stick to the code man, there won't be no trace
Thugga Thugga, tell me what would you say?
What would you say?
No J Money, but my gun say, "Bow"
Pop a molly, look at her then fiend
I'm the target mofucka, no beam
No this shit is not good as it seems
I might give her the boot with no jeans
I kick shit like a chong and a ching
I'm a boss, I'm 'bout that unity
Sandwiches, you know you in between
And you gotta know we at the green
You gotta be young nigga, wilder than Billie Jean
Gotta have paper for lawyer fees
You ain't with it, you a L
Still getting it, yeah, bails
Break it down on the scale
If it add up, hell yeah, I do it
Lap back as he ran to it

[Chorus: Trouble & Young Thug]
Like a thief in the night
I take anything but some pussy
She got that head like a dyke
She got that head that I like
Deep in your partner ain't right
Put that lil' babe on ice

Head on that bucket, your mothafuckin' life, Skoob
I promise you don't know me
I pull up 'bout my cake
Where I'm from is not safe
I got fish, I'm a lake
Scoop them grits on a plate

I'm a thief in the night
Make her ride like a bike

Got a penthouse in the back, it ain't my main room

Nigga, hustlers don't stop, they keep goin'
You can lose your life but it's gon' keep goin'

With a cutie espa'ol, she had a booty like J-Lo
She had Jacobsen sandals, you've been trapped in the bando
She has to trap in the bando, 'cause her momma got cancer
She can't work in the States because her green papers ain't legal
Fuck a "dame un beso", she be like, "Run de un peso"
Push the molly to Pedro so she can feed her abuelo
She refuse to just settle on them shoes with them red soles
And refuse to be nude in front of them dudes on that dance pole (Alright)
She can't lose, she just ooze a bunch of ambition like Nepo-
-Lian, I could be ruler, and ride the streets on my Benzo
So there she get money vicarious off her friends though
'Cause a kid named Birdy look nerdy but he be after the bando (Alright)
She robbed Birdy for birdies, now Birdy after her head though
Hold on I think I see Birdy and Birdy killed my Cuban ho (Ferg)

[Intro]
We got London on the track
Got my bae with me, you know what I'm sayin'?

[Chorus]
If she don't get what she want she whine

Goddamn, I'm sorry b, I know you'd accepted my apology

I need a deep throat baby, swallow me
I love it when you're around baby, follow me
I only eat green, yeah, koala leaf
We shoot with big guns like a Call of D
She never say no, she ain't stallin' me
I kept my heart locked up in a safe, hey
You can't shoot with a pistol, need a K
No, you can't see it, it is tragic by your face
But when it need air, let it out in a safe lil' place
I can see it on her face that if she don't get what she want

[Chorus]
When she don't get what she want she whine
I reminisce when I get high
Looked up baby and say goodbye
I tied my ties, she no longer cry, look you in your eyes

But if this is how I'm feelin', it's gonna work
Yeah, roll me some kush I don't want no purp (hey)

Damn, I broke her heart, now my heart hurt

Oh-no-no, she ain't had no job, but she having purses
Yeah-yeah-yeah, she know I'm the truth, places I'm in first
No-no-no, I don't want you bitches, y'all basic and thirsty
Yeah-yeah, she taught me well, it took some time, but it was worth it
She get on top and she ride it, Kentucky derby
You should see, I count that money like a nerd bitch

Her whole body same color, I call it perfect

[Chorus]
Since she don't get what she want she whine
I reminisce when I get high (yeah)

You know I look at ya like gold, you my future trophy
She know she got my heart, she say do it, I jump like Tarzan
Drugs don't stop, you know I can't stop
Baby don't press charges, she know that I'm on the block
When she pull up, she can't go back, she gon' stop, no
She ain't know what time it was 'til I bought her first clock
Rolex, spend $1,000 on a flock, no Waka
And you know I'm comin' back like Dem Boyz, no Shop
Yeah, loading up a Glock
Take shots, I got Jays on a flava, flava watch
Billidybop, pull up shootin' buck shots (TOP NOTCH!)
Yeah, they watch me like a fuckin cable box

Mama told me never give tops outside the shop
Pull up on yo girl, I'm lurkin' like a cop
Pussy nigga play, I beat them like I box
Hey, I'm the President, baby, blacker BARACK!
30's on the Chevy, my nigga, plus it's a box
You should know me and sharp shooters sponsored by FOX
Split that money up in eight ways like I'm an octopus
On the campus with lots of pounds, kicked outta COLLEGE!
All I bleed is red but nigga, but I'm not stoppin' shit (red light)
Pull up to the set and I come and pay all my homages
Hoppin' out on Bleveland, I pour up straight out the pharmacy
Pussy nigga scared to say it, I got 'em hummin' shit
Lil bitch, you know I'm really thuggin' like Bones & Harmony
(Rich Gang) I can never... (be you)
I'm an animal, you know I got stamina
If a nigga ever got robbed, bitch I'm the manager
And I got an African with weed over on Campbelton
Lil momma don't go, keep it stompin', I want that cameltoe
Pull up to the set with them sticks and have us an ammo show
Lead through the front door with that tec, it's out the back door
Bags in this bitch, so many bags like where the racks go?

[Chorus: Young Thug]
Givenchy my toes and my bros and my hoes, for real
Don't act like you don't know when you know that you know, for real
Even when I'm laying down, baby, I'm keepin' it tucked, for real
Swear to God, when you play with just one of these bucks, you killed

[Post-Chorus: Young Thug]
Baby girl, would you ride for your nigga?
Would you ride for your nigga?
Would you die for a nigga? Hey
Baby girl, would you cry for your nigga?

What you know 'bout that? What you know 'bout that?

You keep me 'ware lookin' like a peacock
Everytime we press she be rooster
Feelin' like the big block time shift

Flippin' on the mat yo

Scream so loud, dolphins hear the signal

If I ain't treat you good little baby just know it's karma
You did my nigga wrong, I know it, it was last summer
Lyin' to me, tellin' me I'm the bomb like Osama
I wish I could spend 50 bands on tour for grandmama
I'll crack that nigga head with a bottle
I could never call, not a fed, not a cop
Niggas sit on the bench and I said do y'all
YSL scream "fuck the rest" 'cause we got right now
Niggas asked me "Am I sure?", and the Bentley said "Yeah"
That little bitch ask for a purse and you know I said "Yeah"
She gon' act just like a clerk when them feds in there
She might act like she know Bird when them players in there, Yeah

I was out the country, ain't know what time I'm on (Different time zones)

I spend more money on security than I make
Just to be safe (Just to be safe)
Just to be safe, dawg (Just to be safe, dawg)
I spend more money on security than I make
Just to be safe, dawg
Gotta make it home

[Verse 1]
Hop out the Bent and into the coupe
Fuzz hit my family, they switchin' it up
It ain't nothin' I could do (Nothin' I could do)
My trust is fucked up
I ride with that wooly, I pour my own juice
Just in case a nigga look on me, and try run up on me
I'ma fuck with the cougars
Elliantte gon' flood me, man fuck it I'm stuntin' on you
I hope you lay down and remember that I was just gunnin' for you (Fool)
They told me that I was gon' end up like MC Hammer
'Cause everything I get, I try to invest it in you
You too and you too
In the daytime a nigga havin' nightmares
I wonder if he answerin' every one of my prayers
Hate to say it but I go broke 'bout anyone of my peers
You ain't gon' never change this shit
Yea, I'm bustin' down, yeah
Every single mothafucker 'round me wrist just gon' bust down, bust down
Ain't gon' get no second chance, you crossed me
I don't give a fuck about you
Yea, I'ma give up on you
Yea, I'ma hit the clutch 'bout you (Skrt)
I'ma throw it up by ya, yea, you better have luck by ya
Can't nobody ever beat the triple cross
I got snake in my veins, snake in my drawls
I got snake on my attire, snake inside my wounds
I put snakes around your eyes and, man, you gon' move

[Chorus]
I'll cock it back, I'm ready to fire that chrome, hey
I was out the country, ain't know what time I'm on
I was tryna get the devil out of my charms
I was thankin' God, I was thankin' Allah I'm on
I spend more money on security than I make
Just to be safe (I spend more money)
Just to be safe, dawg
I spend more money on security than I make
Just to be safe, dawg (Just to be safe)
Gotta make it home

[Verse 2]
And I just wanna make it back to my kiddies
And I just wanna sit back and count these digits
Don't plan on lettin' nobody take their place
I pay more money to security than I make
And it's crazy but it's safe
I get to run around in peace everyday
I know my niggas go monkey like Bathing Ape
I tried to tell you, but you had to learn late
I was just holdin' you down and you didn't stay down like you 'posed to
I had you rollin' around in that Bentley Mulsanne and the Rolls too
I had you glossin' on all of these bitches just like you was 'posed to
I got you latest Chanel, and the latest Fendi, and the Gucci too
I told you, I love you forever
I'm never gon' change, I'm not stoppin', boo
I told you, I was gonna keep your lil' bank account full
And your pocket too
I start at your ear, I'ma lick it, then fuck around and end at the bottom, boo
Together forever, man
Any problem that you got, bitch, I got it too

[Chorus]
I'll cock it back, I'm ready to fire that chrome, hey
I was out the country, ain't know what time I'm on (Different time zones)
I was tryna get the devil out of my charms
I was thankin' God, I was thankin' Allah I'm on
I spend more money on security than I make
Just to be safe (Just to be safe)
Just to be safe, dawg (Just to be safe, dawg)
I spend more money on security than I make
Just to be safe, dawg
Gotta make it home

My life a movie the way they be acting
She say that she like all my ad-libs
This life I gotta appreciate
Remember the time I ain't have this
But when they see me in a mansion
Tell me that they proud and they clapping
AR, I had to demonstrate
Honestly' I'm really just rapping
On my 'Gram' I got fans and they love me
On my 'Gram' I got haters, they hate me
They say that "This nigga a fucking nerd"
Wonder why they seeing me lately
Wonder why they bitch wanna date me
Wonder why they cannot escape me
Wonder why some goofy nigga on the internet richer than them with brace teeth

[Chorus]
Don't fuck with you, I'm gon' fuck it up
Getting records' I fuck with my bucks
Say you want me, then you out of luck
Baby girl, you out of luck
Anti-social' never done the club
Now your ho invite me to the club
But you're sexy, don't want to try me
Girl, nah, that ain't enough
Can't fuck with you, I'm gon' fuck it up
Getting records, I fuck with my bucks
Say you want me, then you out of luck
Baby girl, you out of luck
Anti-social, never done the club
Now your ho invite me to the club
But you're sexy, don't want to try me

[Verse]
Swear, life change quick
Some niggas gotta keep that blick
Can't control if you broke or born rich
If you wanna situation, nigga, deal with it
Ha, bitch, you ain't made that clear
Nigga, see Lil' Tecca on the screen and click
Rewind a few times on the flow real quick
Finnessin' nigga, I was known for this
You immature and I'm grown with it
But it's Young Nigga World, kids so with it
Niggas will accuse you, I know
Just so they close when you blowin' shit
They gon' gas you up regardless, don't care
Trust, fuck your opinion, don't care what you hear
It's Bape boy, it's BB Simons on my gear
Your bitch spittin' game on me, hit from the rear
Me goin' broke, in God what I fear
Thank God she bless me, nigga, no luck
And I'm on my grind like some muhfuckin' trucks
I got the sauce, you can't touch, no

[Pre-Chorus]
My life a movie the way they be acting

We asked to put his ass on a shirt
'Cause he was talkin' down on the set
My nigga's slime, snakes, slizzin'
Shootin' shit like I play for the Clippers
I want money, I got some money
Gas too big, I do it, no Clifford
He was talkin' hot on the net
Told that opp, that boy was missin'
Big guns like a nigga in Black Ops
Bitch, I keep me a missile
(Psh, psh, psh, psh)
Hollows rippin' through his tissue
(Psh, psh, psh, psh)
Break a nigga like a crystal

Yo' nigga, he chasing the city lights

I'm a simple nigga, don't care about the ice
My bitch bad, yo' bitch she aight
Went to LA from New York, I had to go take a flight

[Verse 1]
Talk about me, you don't know about me
Say my music control her body
Anti-social, she don't wanna know nobody
And I count up blue faces, she said she was broke and I'm changing her ways
Oh yeah, that's a opp, yeah, we spray 'em like mace
I just run up the racks and I walk out the Chase
Boy, you a bitch, better stay in your place
We sold to the opps and that boy, he got laced
Boy you ain't squad, boy you ain't gang
Some niggas switch up when they get fame
Some niggas bitch up when they don't stay in their lane
Bitch, got the racks in the Wraith
Bitch, I got the racks in the safe and the racks in the plane
Spent some racks in the plane
Gettin' some fame, shit the same
Nigga fuck this fame, 'cause it change niggas-

[Chorus]

Yo' nigga, he chasing the city lights

Got LV on the sweater
Got a big stock on the Beretta

And they hater niggas mad, 'cause they see a nigga glow
You a lil' nigga, better tell 'em get me some chips from the store
Always been myself, always cool, always had the afro

Why you worry 'bout a nigga?
Better worry 'bout yourself, uh

Too many problems, yeah

You can stay the fuck from 'round me if you ain't gon' ride for me, yeah
Told me you would never leave, how can you just lie to me? Yeah
Get from off your knees, you ain't got to cry to me, yeah
I been giving all my love, tell me, do you feel it?
Never learned how to trust sittin' in penitentiary
All for you, I'll take a slug, baby, who the realest?
Had to tell her I'm a genie, I can answer wishes, yeah

[Verse 1]
I got my static when you ride with me
We get pulled over no you ain't going to do no time for me
I put my hands up police drew down on me
So many charges make me wanna go away overseas
Reminiscing 'bout them days I was sittin' up in that cage
I was begging you to stay and you hung up in my face
Free Kodak, everything gettin' slayed
They keep begging me to change
Talked to Future the other day and he say I need to change lanes (Yeah)
Cause they gon' try to count you out til you make them count you in (Yeah)
Stimulate my brain (Yeah, yeah) had to tell 'em I ain't leaving out the same way I came in (Yeah, oh, fuck what I saying)
Whole lotta heroin, I sell that shit right in front of my momma
Swear I would never run just like a man I'ma face my problems
Even when my voice fucked up
I'ma spit in the booth I'ma go in like a goblin
Nigga got me fucked up
I'ma spin on his block, I admit that I had shot him
VVSs in my chain tell that ho Young Thug everything
Hearing voices in brain hoping everything change
I been rolling through the streets and been clutching on my heat
I put blood all on my feet and I put cameras in my trees (Baby)
Said I changed on you, but I feel that you changed on me (Changed on me)
I said my prayers and you gon' sow just what you reap (Yeah)
I been taking Adderall mixing it with lean (Mixin' it with lean)
Hope I don't wake up out my sleep

[Chorus]
Too many problems, yeah (Too many problems)

Told me you would never leave, how can you just lie to me? Yeah (Oh)
Get from off your knees, you ain't got to cry to me, yeah
I been giving all my love, tell me, do you feel it?
Never learned how to trust sittin' in penitentiary
All for you, I'll take a slug, baby, who the realest?
Had to tell her I'm a genie, I can answer wishes, yeah (Can answer wishes, slime)

[Verse 2]
Being in love never help me solve my problems (Solve my problems)
I wish that I could find a girl just like my mama
I don't wanna hurt nobody, but still ride around with that chopper (Yeah)
Zoe life to the end, tell them free the main sniper (Tell 'em free Kodak)

[Outro]

I wonder who gon' ride for me if it go down
And I start to get this feeling like
Who gon' be there for my sons the day that I'm not around?

[Chorus]
I hope you love me as much as I love you
I ain't mean to break your heart, but baby, that's what thugs do
Nothing in the world, baby I wouldn't do for you
If I die right now it's so much that I would lose

[Post-Chorus]
I'ma tell you now I always be there for you
If it go down now, I know Baby Joe gon' shoot
If you go broke now they ain't gon' do shit for you
Can't give up now, nigga this the life I choose

[Bridge]
Back in 8th grade, I swear I ain't have a thing baby
Since I got money, I swear it ain't been the same baby
Got money in my pocket, diamonds in my chain baby
I won't ever hurt again, I made it through the rain baby

[Verse 1]
Before the fame, I was strapped up on Valley Park with a Glock
I was sellin' them rocks, these police stay watchin' steady passin' by the block
I created that gang, forever I bang, nigga I'll never stop
I stay in my lane, I'm never gon' change, nigga playin', he get popped
I told him record me, I go safari, diamonds wetter than some water
Hellcat not a Charger, way faster than a 'Rari (skrt)
I'm turnin' up in the party, celebratin' all the shit that I did
I told my momma I'm a gangster, I'll never change the way that I live (nah)

[Bridge]
Back in 8th grade, I ain't have a thing baby
Since I got money, I swear it ain't been the same baby
Got money in my pocket, diamonds in my chain baby
I won't ever hurt again, I made through the rain baby

[Chorus]
I hope you love me as much as I love you
I ain't mean to break your heart, but baby, that's what thugs do
Nothing in the world, baby I wouldn't do for you
If I die right now, it's so much that I would lose

[Interlude]
That I would lose
Ahh ahh ahhh (Ahh)
My voice messed up right now
Mmm
Ahh baby

[Verse 2]
Out the blue, I do some magic like I be Houdini
My diamonds wet, they Aquafina like they made in Fiji
I get that Act', I crack the seal, and pour it in some Fiji
I cop a 'vette, I drop my top, and ask you, "Did you see me?"
Gone off that molly, I'm zooted and booted
Got snake on my collar, I tell you it's Gucci
I swear that I'm bout it, you play I'ma shoot it
I'm a 38 baby I swear that I'm ruthless
Walkin' on stage, I'm strapped with a toolie
Long clips, nigga I shoot a movie
I know you notice how we come through and do it
Eviction notice, nigga, bet that you movin'
Red dot and head shots for who wanna do me
Homicides, mommas cry, it ain't nothing to it
I tote them choppas, when we slide, you know I'ma shoot it
So many times I could've died, but you niggas blew it (slatt)

[Bridge]
Back in 8th grade, I ain't have a thing baby
Since I got money, I swear it ain't been the same baby
Got money in my pocket, diamonds in my chain baby
I won't ever hurt again, I made through the rain baby

[Chorus]
I hope you love me as much as I love you
I ain't mean to break your heart, but baby, that's what thugs do
Nothing in the world, baby I wouldn't do for you
If I die right now, it's so much that I would lose

[Outro]

I remember I wanted for to quit for so many times
But I knew this moment'd come, now it's my time
I gotta make up for all them nights that my Momma cried
I'm goin' in, I'm putting everything on the line
Dropped out of school to chase my dream, I had some for to prove
I put my all in this shit, man I can't fuckin' lose
They smile up in my face but they don't know what I been through
Whole lotta nights I went to sleep and I ain't had no food
But now I'm up and I'm just thinking about my next move
Gotta keep my head above water, gotta make it through
I do this shit for my momma and my lil' brother too
Ain't no more problems now I might as well go back to school
Gotta maintain, stay on my grind no I can't be no fool
Naw I can't slip nor I can't fumble, gotta stick and move
Get out BR, move to LA, where I ain't gotta keep a tool
Surprise but I knew my dreams coming true

[Chorus]
We had nothing, stayed down 'til I came up with my niggas
Right or wrong forever right, you know wassup with me nigga
Never change on my gang yeah, I'm stuck with my niggas
We untouchable come run that money up with me nigga

Right or wrong forever right, you know wassup with me nigga
Never change on my gang yeah, I'm stuck with my niggas
We untouchable come run that money up with me nigga

[Verse 2]
Now that I made it, ain't none the same it all changed
When I'm in public people see me they screaming my name
Just a few days ago I was locked up in them chains
Now I'm in back of the Maybach with a lot of bands
I ain't worry 'bout 'em dissin' naw, I don't hear a thing they sayin'
This for my sons in Montana and can't forget Lil Ben
I never jeopardize this and lose it all again
This for that North, 38 baby, they know I ain't playing
From the heart I appreciate all of my fans
This for Monique for loving me and bein' my helping hand
I really did it, this for for mom's, 3Three, Trey and Aaron
Can't nobody tell me nothing I'm like what you sayin'

[Chorus]
We had nothing, stayed down 'til I came up with my niggas
Right or wrong forever right, you know wassup with me nigga
Never change on my gang yeah, I'm stuck with my niggas

[Chorus]
Tryna hide from the camera, I ain't goin' outside today
Couldn't find Hi-Tec, so I'm drinkin' on Act' today

I'ma take it to trial, pray to Lord I beat the case

[Verse 1]
That money be callin'
I don't do no talkin', so get the fuck outta my face
Gotta TEC and a chopper
With a hundred thousand dollars up in the Wraith
You know I ain't slippin', you know that I'm with it
I'll shoot him right up in his face
Three say that I'm trippin', you know that I'm drippin'
I'm wrapped in Saran today
I just bought a brand new watch from God, I ain't put it on yet
I don't care 'bout no bitch, I ain't giving her shit
Spend it all on my homies
I go put on my son, from my car to my house
Everything, I own it
When it come to that money you know I ain't stuntin'
I be on it
I just got a pet monkey, cashed out on a tiger
But really don't want it, my son don't like him
He say that we beefin', you know I won't fight him
My clip full of thunder, you know I'll strike 'em
Wanna join NBA, go and catch you a body
Free Kevin Gates, it's a murder for hire
Double G gang on the front of my title
Got rid of my Glock and I bought me a rifle

[Chorus]
Tryna hide from the camera, I ain't goin' outside today
Couldn't find Hi-Tec, so I'm drinkin' on Act' today
I'ma pull up in style, we gon' do a drive by in the Wraith
I'ma take it to trial, pray to Lord I beat the case

[Verse 2]
I jump out at your house, I ain't shootin' from the corner
Ben bought me a bitch but I really don't want her
I don't do no cappin', I keep it one hunnid
Right now I'm recordin' with ten thousand on me
He say he want smoke but I know he don't want it
Shoot him and his bitch and I up on his homie
You know how I'm feelin', I don't got to say it
Face every problem all by my lonely

[Chorus]
Tryna hide from the camera, I ain't goin' outside today
Couldn't find Hi-Tec, so I'm drinkin' on Act' today

Ayy, ayy, how you bangin' back there?
(Say it, I'm in the studio right now, tell 'em what it is)
Yeah, yeah, oh, oh
Slime, yeah, slime

[Verse 1]
I'ma say I'm sorry for all of the shit that I had did
And I'm thankful for that shit that you had done while we was kids
Been puttin' my soul up in this music and I'm hopin' that you hear it
I'm steady screamin' 4K Trey, I'm tryna split a nigga wig
All these bitches tellin' lies, but if you know me, don't think twice
Instead of doin' what's wrong, lil' bitch, you do what's right
I feel like fuck livin' disguised
I showed my wrong, don't hide my right
You saw me down, you tryna show off for the hype
(Hey, don't do that lame ass shit)
I fuck with you, but you don't fuck with me
But somehow we still find a way to text each other 'fore we go to sleep
I don't know shit about no Jodeci
But you gon' suck me to his music while I sit back, think, and smoke my weed
These killers 'round me, they look up to me
I got them bodies, I won't say no names, I hope it don't catch up to me
You really mad that you can't fuck with me
You X'd me out, you ain't have to fuck with me
Nigga, why you came to fuck with me?

[Chorus]
Told you that I'd do anything for you
I just don't know what they want
And I wasn't frontin' when I told you I love you
Girl, you the only one that I want
These niggas be cappin'
We pull up slangin' that static
Don't do no talkin', have your shit together when we come
I got too many brothers that done died by the gun
I murder from the heart, so you can say what you want

[Verse 2]
They say she fucked with that nigga, I wish I caught her
Smokin' on this Cherry Pie, fuckin' your favorite athlete daughter
They say that nigga that been trippin', put that bitch in order
I just came through swervin', nigga, in a Hellcat Charger
Jigga was swervin' behind me, turn up in a Benz
Studio session, go in
Tell 'em lil' niggas I said for them not to walk in
Up with the Glock, let off ten
Poppin' them bottles of lean with Instagram models, stayin' at the Drury Inn
I know she don't drink, she said that she drink, I let her just sip what she can
I say, "Lil' Ben, you hear them talkin'?" He say "Uh-uh"
I hit the gas and then we turn up on they ass
Ran up my money, and they hear it when I talk now
Them bitches know it's over with, they in my past
'Cause you left ice on my heart
And I could say that ho wasn't wrong, you wasn't right from the start
I wish you could exchange my time for that watch that I bought
Really was tryna make you mine, I don't know what I had thought

[Chorus]
Told you that I'd do anything for you
I just don't know what they want
And I wasn't frontin' when I told you I love you
Girl, you the only one that I want
These niggas be cappin'
We pull up slangin' that static
Don't do no talkin', have your shit together when we come
I got too many brothers that done died by the gun
I murder from the heart, so you can say what you want

Remember me and Three we used to ride up in a stolo
Now I'm in a two-door coupe, it used to be a four-door
Don't pay for cable, he want static, tell him let me know though
I'm quick to let a nigga have it, you know I'ma blow though
Late at night, I used to sneak out my grandfather window(no cap)
And I was coolin' on a flight, and I was hittin' them licks though
Wasn't for him I wouldn't be shit, so I ain't gotta trip though
Ten thousand dollars, that ain't shit, I gave him that times three though (slatt)

[Pre-Chorus]
Through the night when it be stormin'
Hopin' everything could clear up by the morning
Niggas tellin' lies so I gotta be honest
Ask me for the Tellage, you know that I'ma run it

[Chorus]
Turned up like we want it, we pulled up on that dumb shit
Flexin' on these niggas, pockets full of blue hundreds
Ain't no goin' back, you know I'm gon' keep it comin'
Ain't no time to wait, so nigga play, we gon' burn him

[Verse 2]
Can't tote no gun but got that Glock When I'm up in a Yo' though
Plus my PO and the Police knockin' at my door though
I get creative on the track just like a blunt of dope though
I told Nini I'm comin' back, she think I'm with a hoe though
Hundred grand in my pocket when I wanna flex
Back in the day them niggas laughed when I said I'm next
Up with the choppa 'case that boy try reach for my neck
You know how I'll pop 'em, fuck that shit, I put his ass to rest (brrt, slime)

[Chorus]
Turned up like we want it, we pulled up on that dumb shit
Flexin' on these niggas, pockets full of blue hundreds
Ain't no goin' back, you know I'm gon' keep it comin'
Ain't no time to wait, so nigga play, we gon' burn him, yeah

[Outro]
Yeah, slatt, slatt, slatt, slatt

Dubba-AA flex
Drawin' symbols in the sand 'til my pain gone, baby
Movin' onto the land where the gate close, baby
This is the sound

[Verse 1]
They say Kentrell got a baby, he ain't nothin' but thirteen
They told me that he needed love, he couldn't pay for what he need
They said he said he don't feel love and he so caught in these streets
They say he plottin' to kill himself because he just wanna leave
Plus he ain't happy with himself 'cause what he want he can't keep
He feel like he won't make it out because his problems too deep
He had a shootout in the south, his friend got hit with that heat
He startin' to have some crazy thoughts, he put tattoos on his sleeve
He got one tatted by his eye, it symbolizes Nene
He swear to never tell no lie 'cause that's not what he believe
He keep a pistol when he ride but still feel like he gon' leave
They say that girl not on his side because he gave her herpes

[Chorus]
They say he drawin' symbols in the sand 'til his pain gone, baby
They say he movin' onto the land where the gate close, baby
They say he drawin' symbols in the sand 'til his pain gone, baby
They say he movin' onto the land where the gate close, baby

[Verse 2]
They say his misstress walked in on him, he was playin' with some fire
They say he mentioned to his nigga he might blow out his mind
Say he been lookin' real suspicious, they can tell he been cryin'
They say he steady waitin' on somethin', he keep his eyes on the time
They hear the headphones on his head playin' Luther Vandross, baby (sayin this home not a home)
They read his wall it was written up in hand he got a dead soul, baby
They say he headed onto the land to hear his grandma call, baby
He said they don't understand who I am, they all think I'm goin' crazy

[Chorus]
They say he headed onto the land where the gate close, baby
They say he drawin' symbols in the sand 'til his pain gone, baby
I say I'm drawin' symbols in the sand 'til my pain gone, baby
I say I'm headed onto the land where the gate close, yeah

[Verse 3]
They say go get that out his hand, he on the porch with a choppa
They say he took like seven Xans, he say he's helpin' his problems
He say he cannot trust a girl, he got no love for his momma
And he got used while he was up, he feel he back at the bottom
They say his body actin' up, he don't want go to the doctor
They say they see he givin' up, he don't want no talk 'bout no dollar
His only trust is for to run because his past gon' follow
They say this nigga dressin' crazy, he won't put down his collar

[Chorus]
They say he headed onto the land where the gate close, baby
They say he drawin' symbols in the sand 'til his pain gone, baby
I say I'm drawin' symbols in the sand 'til my pain gone, baby
I say I'm headed onto the land where the gate close, baby

[Outro]
Drawin' symbols in the sand 'til the pain gone, baby

Slatt

[Chorus]
When it all comes down, I been here for too long
And I still can't believe that I didn't moved on (yeah)
Ain't no sign of love

I ain't for you no more, you ain't gotta come back it's too late

[Verse 1]
You ain't gotta move on
I done found another girl who ain't mad about the names on my face
I guess my home wasn't a home
I'll accept the fact if another man up in my place
You ain't gotta try to fix it, I ain't worried about it
And if you looking for your shit it's on the curb bout it
Bought a water meter and it's way off the meter
Yo' love is plain, Tell that hoe I don't need her
Told me to stop but drink still in my liter
Hope when you come that I be gone, I don't wanna see you
Forever I'll stay the same but I can't no mo'
Forever ducking your presence till I can't no mo'
And I remain the same with a big sack (aye)
Said don't buy no car but I done bought a big 'bach (yeah)
They say my ex been looking for me
Where she at (aye)
Tell her leave a message, Imma' call that bitch back (aye)
And bae I love you
Never did you wrong but Imma leave like a thug do
And I'm regretting the fact that I even touched you
Even though you said fuck me it's never fuck you (it ain't never fuck you bae)

[Chorus]

And if them people try to come and pick me up
Tell them bitches before they come in here I'm blowing out my brains
Cause I don't know
How you would let pride come in here and catch me slipping
I always knew you would leave any day
How the fuck I ever  put myself in this position
Fake friend follow you, you follow back
But I been knew you was like that

Aye look mane the hook tell it all

[Outro]
When it all come down I been here for too long
And I still can't believed I done moved on

(Straight up)

[Chorus]
If you want it, you got it, you know how I'm rockin'
They never could stop it, it's stuffed in my pocket
I got up for the score and they never could block it
After the show, I count up in a Masi'
Tears fall from the lies, despite
Hunnid bands through the time of the night
When you left, I ain't wanna live life
Now I'm happy on the in and outside
Can you make it better? Trap out like Griselda
Post up with Berettas, hustlin' through the night, yeah
Spin the block, finna stretch 'em
Wake the hood up when we wet 'em
And it's all gon' be alright, yeah
When that wrong choice take your life, yeah
Gucci print should be on top of that Nike print
From them rich niggas kickin' yo' back door
And they should give a Rollie to niggas who want it
Who don't know a thing but trap, though
Blue faces, I put that over nat hoes
The shit that we sellin' will make you relapse, though
Thinkin' I'm slippin', run up and get clapped, ho
I put that North on the map, ho (Gang)

[Verse 1]
Turn up on a bitch when I'm gone off a Perc
That ho gon' fuck on a fast beat
Ben behind me, do the dash, keepin' up in a Vert
You get jacked out yo' shit, you can't text me
Pussy nigga throwin' shots, ain't at me
Strapped up, tell that nigga get at me
Tough love for a bitch, won't trap me
Pay for the body then I give them the MAC free
Got a pound in the car, I'ma smoke on that
Left the state for a show and I'm comin' back
If he say he want smoke, ain't no fallin' back
Want a bitch for the play, I'ma blow the strap
He ain't usin' his head, put it in his lap
He ain't 'bout it, could tell that he only rap
I just put 40 bands inside the trap
Every manifestation, I'm callin' rare (Gang)

[Chorus]
Now can you make it better? Trap out like Griselda
Post up with Berettas, hustlin' through the night, yeah
Tell Jugg bust a right, yeah
Hop out, gun flames through the night, yeah
You know how I'm rockin', you know that I'm with it
You loyal to me, I'll make sure that you get it
If you want it, you got it, you know how I'm rockin'
They never could stop it, it's stuffed in my pocket
I go up for the score and they never could block it
After the show, I count up in a Masi'
Tears fall from the lies, despite
Hunnid bands through the time of the night
When you left, I ain't wanna live life
Now I'm happy on the in and outside

[Verse 2]
Pick it up, throw it out, watch it come back
Got a whole hunnid racks in a Dior bag
Count up that money, I run up the sack
Boardin' on the jet with a illegal strap
The shit that they talk, I could tell you is cap
Up off the X and I only took half
Stay energized, I fall back from the tabs
Put a half in my way, I'ma pay off the staff
I feel like it ain't no bitch I can't have
Saint Laurent boot with the fur like a bear
Balenciaga, that Gucci, and Prada
I got on all three and I bought several pair
When it's up, what we slidin' in, duckin' from 12
Time wise, clockwise, I never fail (No)
Ain't no slackin', we hustlin', we on this for real
If we don't get it, we take it, you know what it is

[Chorus]
Can you make it better? Trap out like Griselda
Post up with Berettas, hustlin' through the night, yeah
Can you make it better? Trap out like Griselda
Post up with Berettas, hustlin' through the night, yeah
Now, can you make it better? Trap out like Griselda
Post up with Berettas, hustlin' through the night, yeah
Spin the block, finna stretch 'em
Wake the hood up when we wet 'em
And it's all gon' be alright, yeah
When that wrong choice take your life, yeah
Gucci pressure be on top of that Nike print (Shh)
From them rich niggas kickin' yo' back door
And they should give a Rollie to niggas who want it
Who don't know a thing but trap, though
Blue faces, I put that over nat hoes
The shit that we sellin' will make you relapse, though
Thinkin' I'm slippin', run up and get clapped, ho
I put that North on the map, ho (Gang)

[Intro]
Yeah, this for everybody who...
Who lost someone to the streets, or to the system
I catch myself feelin' down from people talkin' 'bout me
They don't even know me though

[Verse 1]
'Round 2005, when I wrote my first rhyme
When I first started I wanted to quit so many times
My brother told me "Trell, you ain't gotta tell no lies"
Went from the ground to my prime, now I'm on the rise
Could see the pain in my eyes but I always smile
Despite the hate, that's on my child I'll never stop
My mama asked me "Son, how it feel to be on top?"
Always had that hustler ambition since I was a child
I drop my nuts and be a man, they don't understand
No matter what I tell my fans, they don't know who I am
They criticize me and don't know me, I don't give a damn
I tell my sons that I love 'em every time I see 'em
My family talk about me, I just act like I don't hear 'em
A nigga ever cross me, swear that I wouldn't wanna be him
I'm from the streets, put you to sleep and I won't shed a tear
So when it's beef, my niggas creep, no they won't let you live
I remember everything lil' Dave said
The image of them killin' you stuck in my head
Forever thuggin', on my brother I ain't scared
I'm screamin' "Fuck em!" they gon' miss me when I'm dead
I told my girl that I love her, please don't change on me
I speak the truth, bae I'm for you, I'll put a ring on it
I tell you everything, honestly 'cause you my homie
I'll put a shield over yo' back whenever it be stormin'
My love for you, I let 'em know, yeah
Me and you, we gon' grow old, yeah
You down for me, and that I know, yeah
What we don't tell, they don't know, yeah

[Chorus]
Up in these streets I done seen so many things
Swear I'm so young for to have so much pain
I ain't have nothin', I had to make it through the rain
They changed on me but man I swear that I won't change
Right now I'm workin' for to be a better man
Ain't have no father, so I had to take a stand
They ain't with me if they ain't feelin' what I'm sayin'
Get up, go get it, you don't need no helpin' hand

[Verse 2]
(How can they change?)
How can they change up on me?
So many needs so I'm workin' hard, no sleep
Yeah I'ma make it, yeah I know 'cause I believe
Could be in jail but in yo' mind you free
Right or wrong, that's yo' decision, accept it and you run with that
I'm with you then I'm with you, I won't change, it ain't none of that
I ain't gotta prove a thing, if you play me then I'm dumpin' that
Hop up in my spaceship, I'm gone, I ain't comin' back
They say "You don't know what you got until it's gone" and I see...
That I'm gone and I ain't comin' back
Got it on my own, I stayed strong and I got what I believed
Man I swear that I ain't comin' back
Told me that you with me and you lied to me
If you my nigga, you my nigga, you gon' ride for me
If you my girl, when it's time, you'd testify for me
I'd die for you, so in return you should die for me

[Chorus]
Up in these streets, I done seen so many things
Swear I'm so young for to have so much pain
I ain't have nothin', I had to make it through the rain
They changed on me but man I swear that I won't change
Right now I'm workin' for to be a better man
Ain't have no father, so I had to take a stand
They ain't with me if they ain't feelin' what I'm sayin'
Get up, go get it, you don't need no helpin' hand

I got hoes runnin' in and out, slime in this bitch

[Verse]
I go by YoungBoy and I zip you up from talkin' shit
These niggas bitches and I know that they ain't 'bout that shit
Can't come how I'm comin', I was a youngin when they tried that shit
I been knockin' niggas off, they never knew it was gon' come to this
Bitch, I been on some rider shit (Let's go), I leave 'em dead
Got the whole city mad, I zip that boy 'bout what he said
You can stunt like you mad, I put a bag on top your head
I was up in the parish, slept with playpals under my bed
'Cause, bitch, I'm tryna flex somethin', do some' with all y'all
Soon as we get up on the walk, my youngin' punch his head off
Lil' bitch, I'm out the North Side, I'm bustin', I won't stand down
I'll put the bitch up in a casket, fuck up your headstone
Them niggas used to run the city, won't even claim that bitch
Don't say nothin' 'cause the shit ain't serious, don't make me tame that shit
These youngins runnin' with me with it, they on some dangerous shit
Bustin', put two in your fitted, I call that gang assist
Rollin', I just popped one, tryna body bag and zip somethin', yeah
Pants hangin' off my ass, Glock on my side with a green flag
Talkin' reckless, caught him slippin', went to bustin', did him bad
Soon as we swerve, we bend the curve, don't do no talkin', that's your ass
I ain't got no chill, I'm tryna send a bitch to Winnfield
Had to show the pussy bitch I been that, and bitch, I'm still is
Bitch, I pull up, make a nigga get back, like what the deal is?
All these pussy bitches choosin' sides like they don't know real

[Interlude]
Mmh, come on, bitch, uh-uh, let me go
Yeah, chill out, yeah, bitch, ayy, I'll do somethin' with you
(Bitch ass nigga say)
And I'll bang it out with you
Old ho ass nigga (Let's do it, look)

[Outro]
Do what you do, I put you on the news, bitch, we could fight or shoot
Bitch, I know these niggas know it's murder when I'm comin' through
Bitch, I always win, I never lose, we gon' fuck over you
You become a victim of the chopper, put him on the news (Huh?)

[Intro]
DJ Swift on the track
Yeah
I remember everything
Yeah
Told him I'm never changing I got it

[Verse 1]
Remember smoking weed with your lil' brother
Matter fact nigga, I used to call you my big brother
Then you did some foul shit and had sex with my sister
Then threw it in my face in front the people on insta
I ain't gon' speak on that disease that y'all gave to each other
I take my lick and keep trucking, forever I keep it gutter
So much love for my brother even though I ain't give him nothing
All the shit he did for me I know he feelin' like fuck me
Remember my first time gettin' shot at, got a gun and start clutchin'
Billy and Ray we was thuggin'
All that night stealing sumthing
You introduced me to them boys and i ain't like them for nothing
For some reason I'm still happy that Big B had stuck
Missing Deno, man I really looked at dude like a brother
Saw him in jail and ion't know why but I had asked him to scuffle
This for Brianna, never thought that we would change on each other
My loyalty right here with Fat, but you still know that I love you
Three3 remember you and Ben was the ones that was stuntin'
I use to ain't have no money, asked Monique I was bummin'
Ben told me "Mane you alway fuckin' askin' for something"
Grandma had just died and nobody ain't want give me nothing
Stole Joe weed, got on my grind I was tryna make me something
I kept smokin' all my pack, I couldn't hustle for nothing
Some shit had came missin' out your pack and you had put the blame on me
Hurt me deep, you don't never suppose to question your brother
After all you did for me you think that I'll steal from you?
I had to distance myself, back through that North I was runnin'
I went to juvenile was lookin' at myself like a flunkie
Through a window I couldn't see out all I heard was some thunder
On the phone with Lashonda, she told me ashtray was dead on the corner
Started sayin' to myself I gotta get out this jungle
When them niggas killed my cousin mane that shit made me wonder
I keep a burner I refuse to let them boys put me up under

[Chorus]
Come pour up with a real nigga
Light one up for them real niggas
I know Boozilla still with me
Yeah, I know Lil' Dave still with me
I know my grandma still with me, while I'm chasing after this mill ticket
I know my grandma still with me, while I'm chasing after this mill ticket

[Verse 2]
I hop out get the bustin' before I let myself die
Starin' down the barrel just like lookin' in your eye
Take one mine I'll make sure that we all cry
Take one of mine I swear that we gon' all cry
Top shottah, big mon, big mon
Top shottah, big mon, big mon
Top shottah, big mon, big mon
Fah mi fi dead, we don't spare none, spare none
Dive in that water with no vest on
Only thing I got is my teflon
Watch out I bet I stretch some
Watch out I bet I stretch some
See me in that Benz, hop out that Benz and they hatin'
You can run up on me and gon' catch one to the face
Pussyhole saw me and he went the other way
I'm like wha gwan we can do it anyday
And they hatin'
Pussy hoe saw me and he went the other way
Like wha gwan we can do it anyday
I'm like whatup? we can do it anyday


[Outro]
For some reason I have visions of someone splittin' my wig
Lord, please forgive me, for all the things that I done did
Mom, I'm sorry for being a bad kid
I hope you forgive me and pray for me til' the end

[Intro: Youngboy Never Broke Again & uncredited female]
What is they?

Who is this bitch that you looking at?
Ion know her
I'm really tired of this
You tripping
I'm so tired of this, I really hope them niggas get you

[Chorus]
I heard they speaking on my name
They do it all for the fame
Paid attention how you changed
Know that I'll never change
Know they ain't feelin my pain
Yea, unnnnn huhhh

[Verse 1]
2016 I got locked in that cell and they ain't let me out
Money I'm talking, you know that I'm ballin' I'm hustlin and I ain't never seen a drought
Spending this cash, but I can not forget to make sure that all my niggas on
Spending this money no question do I think about it, I'll never say that I don't
Walk off alone, when I talk on the phone, dropping the price and you know that they on
Soon as we get it, you know that its gone
I swear that we been at this shit for so long
Momma ask for something and I tell her no
She tell me I ain't shit, and act like I'm wrong
I'm running that check up everytime I'm gone
For christmas I swear I'mma buy you a home
I get on my knees and I pray on my own
Thanking the lord that I'm here, I ain't gone
I pray the judge that Q come home
Choppa boy feel he all alone
You know I got money but I'm in a hole
Scared I'mma die when I'm out on the road
Don't know how I'm feelin, don't know what I'm on
All they wanna do is ask for a loan

[Pre-Chorus]
All this pain man, I feel like I can't hold it
Goin' off lean and you know that I be on it
I ain't slipping boy, you knowing that I'm focused
Fly time, prime time, I'm ballin' hard sideline
Baby I'm sorry I ain't got time for to waste
On the road, yeah I be gone everyday
Too 100 to put myself around the fakes
It's time for real niggas and fake bitches to separate

[Chorus]
I heard they speaking on my name
You better stay up in your lane
They do it whatever for the fame
You know that I'll never change
I paid attention how you changed
I'm never exposin' my pain
I'm head first 'bout my gang
I swear all we know is bang

[Verse 2]
Same nigga took your chain tried to kill me
Meet up to buy it, you know I'm gon' split him
He be with them boys, they ain't no gorillas
It's only room for just me and my niggas
They fake as a bitch and swear I don't feel em
We catch 'em gon' strech 'em you know we gon' hit 'em
I stay with that poker, that Joker, let's deal 'em
Free my hittas man the judge ain't bail 'em
They telling me that hoe there got a million
I don't give a fuck, I ain't far from a million
I heard that bitch old man want kill me
I'm sitting at the top I guess I'm the villian
When you around me, hoe don't do no whisperin'
You say I act funny cause I keep my distance
When we be fucking don't do know resisting
You know I go hard everytime I hit it ( come here)

[Bridge]
All this pain man, I feel like I can't hold it
I can't swim but I'm deep off in that ocean
I go to sleep in my drip, when I wake up I just smile how I'm flexin'
I know these niggas want test me, wish they could catch me
I thank the lord that he bless me

[Pre-Chorus]
All this pain man, I feel like I can't hold it
Goin' off lean and you know that I be on it
I ain't slipping boy, you knowing that I'm focused
Fly time, prime time, I'm ballin' hard sideline
Baby I'm sorry I ain't got time for to waste
On the road, yeah I be gone everyday
Too 100 to put myself around the fakes
It's time for real niggas and fake bitches to separate

[Chorus]
I heard they speaking on my name
You better stay up in your lane
They do it whatever for the fame
You know that I'll never change
I paid attention how you changed
I'm never exposin' my pain
I'm head first 'bout my gang
I swear all we know is bang

[Intro: YoungBoy Never Broke Again]
I are who you say I a-a-am
(Shawty say I she feeling me, I ain't never set back tho')
Yessir

[Verse 1: YoungBoy Never Broke Again]
Thug nigga from the trenches never had a heart
Drug dealer, contract killer, loyal from the start (Start)
I put that dope dick down on shawty, I've been servin' raw
They say I'm pussy and they say I'm fake but I say

[Chorus: YoungBoy Never Broke Again]
I'm are who you say I am, yeah-eh-eh
Shittin' on 'em, I just switched from a Wraith to a Lamb,' yeah-eh-eh

[Verse 2: YoungBoy Never Broke Again]
Got into it with my bitch, caught up while I'm tourin'
Tryna see if shawty on my dick, wonder what she doin'
You know me, real G, I text ask her, "How it's goin'"
She responded nothin', lookin' like to me you havin' fun
Look for my mama when I try to look inside my woman
Told my bae, "I wish I woulda found you back when I was bummin'"
Stayed away from all the bullshit, them niggas said I'm runnin'
Time passed over now you see that I was chasin' money
Posted on Maryland, me and Von, his mama tearin' just once
Know you seen up in the parish, like check it out that's my lil' youngin'
Nigga don't wanna sell me a brick of dope, act like my money funny
Damn what you sayin' gangsta, you gon' make me take it from you
Some hoes say I'm handsome, some of them they say I'm ugly
Some say that I'm the realest but I still ain't sayin' nothin'
'Cause

[Chorus: YoungBoy Never Broke Again]
I'm are who you say I am, yeah-eh-eh
Shittin' on 'em, I just switched from a Wraith to a Lamb,' yeah-eh-eh
I upgraded from nobody to the one who the man, yeah (To the man, yeah)
I'm are who you say I am, yeah-eh-eh

[Verse 3: Quando Rondo]
Tryna run me up a check, late nights, early mornings
Diamonds 'round my neck, they really wet, I could've copped a foreign
Givenchy shoes, I came a long way from Ralph Lauren
Cut off my ex because my new bitch put that pussy on me
They watchin' every move I make, I guess I'm settin' trends
I had to focus on the check, told myself, "Fuck a friend"
Committed crimes so many times but I don't give a damn
I are who you say I am
Posted on high street, me and roof 'cause we been really thuggin'
Convicted felon with a dirty pistol, bitch I'm steady clutchin'
No drama sittin' in my cell like check out my lil' cousin
Can't trust these hoes because I know they come a dime a dozen
RIP to Quahfee, know my nigga at them Heaven gates
She ain't never really made love, I'm him just like Kevin Gates

[Verse 4: Kevin Gates]
20 of 'em comin', I switched to another spot
Reversible stock carbon, a new convertible drop
I was gambling with shawty, I put some work on the block
I tested her, she held a lil' quarter bird at her spot
I ain't into bustin' down a Rollie, bustin' down on bales
Don't wanna fuck me, I won't argue baby, oh well
The 18 Willard, the lever get 'em movin' mils
Millionaire dollar bond in 30 minutes and I made bail
I graduated, the square's outta town, at the room cookin' at the hotel (yeah, yeah)
Aux is outta reach, I'ma move the race car (Vroom)
Hated on us and they know who they are
Still livin' large as I aim for the stars
I'm a BreadWinner don and I came from the slums
I got a stain on my arm, weather through the storm
If I tell you that I love you then you can't do nothin' wrong
Surrounded by steppers, I got control in this bitch
I'll book you for a show and get you showed in this bitch
Tell that curb boy Trell I love you with all my heart
Now we ride around in Wraiths with a push button start (vroom)

[Chorus: YoungBoy Never Broke Again]
Cause I'm are who you say I am, yeah-eh-eh
Shittin' on 'em, I just switched from a Wraith to a Lamb,' yeah-eh-eh
I upgraded from nobody to the one who the man, yeah (to the man, yeah)
I'm are who you say I am, yeah-eh-eh

[Intro]
Youngboy
Last life

[Chorus]
In this life that I'm livin', I pray I make it through the night
As I ride through my city, I'm thinkin', lookin' at the lights
For so long, we was hurtin', I got the chance to make it right
Plenty times you done hurt me, I done been all alone tonight
They claim that they with me, but shit I know that they ain't right
Gotta stay down and get it, I know that it's gon' be alright
Can't get knocked off my pivot, I gotta play my cards right
Gotta stack up them benji's, my nigga we gon' ball for life

[Verse 1]
For so long, I been striving, going hard, tryna make it right
So much pain in my body, know you can see it in my eyes
You say that you was with me, promised that you was down to ride
Now when I look around, you ain't no where by my side
Hurt me so deep, but it's okay, I'm on my grind
I got two sons, I'm just 16, can't waste my time
Straight from the bottom, to the top, I gotta climb
That boy say that he don't like me, tell him fall in line
Soul survivor, I won't stop, yeah I'ma grind for it
I'm from Baton Rouge, Louisiana, I done came far
Whole lot of diamonds around my neck, yeah I'm shining hard
I'm sixteen, driving in all these exotic cars
And I don't owe nobody shit, but my mama boy
And my niggas, cause they the one's who behind me boy
Remember I ain't have none to eat, I had to go steal for it
Show you my bank account, I swear I got 6 figures large
Niggas 'round me, they hatin', prolly was snakin' for it
These niggas under disguise, livin' under the board
I guess these niggas they was made for it, but there's
No mistake he play, gon' die cause I ain't going for it

[Chorus]
In this life that I'm livin', I pray I make it through the night
As I ride through my city, I'm thinkin', lookin' at the lights
For so long, we was hurtin', I got the chance to make it right
Plenty times you done hurt me, I done been all alone tonight
They claim that they with me, but shit I know that they ain't ride
Gotta stay down and get it, I know that it's gon' be alright
Can't get knocked off my pivot, I gotta play my cards right
Gotta stack up them benji's, my nigga we gon' ball for life

[Verse 2]
Aye, I can't even lie I really miss my daddy
Can't trip bout you leaving me
Wasn't for you, this wouldn't happened
Woke up with a opportunity to feed my family
My limit the stars and I wanna grab it
Yeah I just wanna grab it
I'm on a whole 'nother level right now

[Chorus]
In this life that I'm livin', I pray I make it through the night
As I ride through my city, I'm thinkin', lookin' at the lights
For so long, we was hurtin', I got the chance to make it right
Plenty times you done hurt me, I done been all alone tonight
They claim that they with me, but shit I know that they ain't ride
Gotta stay down and get it, I know that it's gon' be alright
Can't get knocked off my pivot, I gotta play my cards right
Gotta stack up them benji's, my nigga we gon' ball for life

My heart covered down with lean
I'll never choose you, won't admit that I'm right
Them hoes wanna just be you, they tell you leave out my life
They tried to make me leave you 'lone but I said, "Fuck it, we fight"
I'm on a road, tryna figure who you fuck wit' at night
But I say fuck it, prison taught me better, turn up rock out with that metal
You sneaking 'round with these niggas, I guess that, that nigga better
Try my hardest not to hit her, know you think that I'ma kill her
If you leave I ain't got nobody, I better not catch a nigga with her
'Cause in the streets nigga, we bang for our life (We bang)
For you, I risked everything, I feel like I paid the price
If you ain't happy, I ain't happy, I just want make it right

How the fuck can I live alone? (Yeah)
Don't wanna talk before you came I was down
How the fuck can you leave me 'lone? (Yeah)

[Refrain]
On the block with that dog food, truck comin' bop-bop

Bitch that been my girl from the jump, you play I'm  laying down
'Cause you know, I'll never let em disrespect her (No)
On my own, I been balling on another level (Another level)
And I'm gone, I'm sending hits, they think that I'm a devil (I'm a devil)
On the road, nobody left, I done brought all my niggas (Gang)

Pressed by my life, my interview be the booth

And the day I do catch her shit, then I'm through
What it is, nigga? Fuck you
Ayy, 'cause I ain't worried bout nothin'

How the fuck you gon' go be in another one and make it work, it's the same thing

[Intro]
I ain't no bad person, no
Ayy I ain't no gangster, ain't no killer

Like everybody make mistakes, that's life
Name one fuckin' person who ain't make mistakes, you feel me?
Man like we, I don't know what to say
I don't know if I'm targeted
I don't know if it's from what I speak about, like I don't know

Yeah, yeah
And they ain't never seen this shit before
(Ooh, BigHead on the beat)
Young nigga shit
Bitch, gang, gang, blatt, blatt, hrrr
38 Baby

[Verse]
Without no coat I was walkin' and meditatin' in the rain
Reminiscing about bein' in prison, I was locked in them chains
Without no drugs I was workin' and stimulatin' my brain
I ain't gotta act how I was actin', everything done changed
I was missing out on plenty shit, just watchin' time fly past
I was broke, down on my dick, I had to get me a bag
Havin' shootouts broad day and we was runnin' from task
I put my flex down, never sit down, I told that bitch I'll never stand down
Creepin' on your block with a hundred rounds
Go to shoot and try to run
Hop out the whip and we gon' run you down
Shoot him dead up his head, knock off his dreads
Now he can't make a sound
Kill him where he stand, we live by law and we gon' lay it down
Tell me he want smoke, 187, that's that same shit
.357 send you to hell, knock out your brain quick
Sippin' on this drank, RIP Fredo, this that bang shit
Doin' the same thing, time pass, got a bitch with a fat ass
I told her turn around and bust it open
That Soulja Slim, that C Murder, come in the tank just like a No Limit soldier
I'm poppin' X so I'm steady rollin'
Say he a gangster, got his chest out
When I hit him with this Glock I bet I fold him
None of these niggas ain't never play with me
Play with me, I bet you see
Fuck that Twitter beefin', you want beef, I pull up where you sleep
Bitch I'm out the North, 38 Baby, I come from the streets
Two clips on that chopper for to stretch you when we fuckin' meet
Got 'em all boxed in at the location, the police movin' in
People tryna catch me with a pistol just to turn me in
Same shit you did to go to jail, don't do that shit again
Bitch I'm screamin' fuck it, never change, thuggin' to the end
I got a question, tell me what these niggas hatin' for?
Why they steady sayin' they gon' snatch my chain though?
You want to rap, how you gon' think without a brain though?
Take gunpowder out a bullet, put some crack, now this that 'caine flow
I'ma hit 'em with this bitch and watch 'em overdose (shoot 'em up yeah, yeah)
I'ma hit 'em with this bitch and watch 'em overdose (fill 'em up yeah, yeah)
Overdose, I kill 'em slow
What's the 4-1-1, they know I be, I be 'bout whatever
You ain't got no bodies, you ain't 'bout it, boy you are not a stepper
You play with me, bitch ain't no hidin', ain't nobody can help you
Send your ass to the devil, in an envelope like a letter
Got an FN with a clip with different colors up in it
It's all bronze like a penny, only see fire when I spit it
I ain't shoot this bitch in a minute, a nigga play, he can get it
Double G, that stand for gang, you niggas know how we livin'

[Intro]
Playboy on this bitch but he ain't playin' though

[Chorus]
Cut my ties with my people, now my grandfather poppin'
Ran it up, all by myself though, now they never gon' stop me
And I see they say I flop though (yeah, yeah)
In my head I know what I know
Oh, and I said
I count fifties, all in hundreds, that's that time flow baby
I say stop it, no comparisons on that time now baby
And, oh yeah, I cannot keep it off my mind
Now, oh yeah, they cannot seem to keep up now
I been hidin' from attention on the rise
I didn't respond and now they see me on the rise
I got some sense up in my head now
I'm on my shit and I'm not scared now

[Verse 1]
Slander my name, I ain't do shit to nobody
Relationship goes to the ones with the problems
She want her space and she got it
Talk about babies, only got three children
I ain't want no part and I swear ain't kidding
Gave her my love, now she say she don't feel me
And I been betrayed, it ain't no forgiving

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause I'm riding in a new Maybach, yeah
Walk with a whole lotta racks, yeah
Tote on a whole lotta straps, yeah
Push a nigga shit way back, yeah
Heart cold as a bitch, no cap, yeah
Fuck nigga play get splat, yeah
Fuck what they say, state facts, yeah
Kill the whole world with these racks, yeah
I feel I'm right, they say that I been wrong my whole life
Thought that was life, but since it's not, I keep my soul tight
'Cause I came from the bottom
Can't make you forever be with somebody
'Til the day I'm not heard, I'ma stack every dollar
I'ma blow out the brain when I feel that I got 'em

[Chorus]
Cut my ties with my people, now my grandfather poppin'
Ran it up, all by myself though, now they never gon' stop me
And I see they say I flop though (yeah, yeah)
In my head I know what I know
Oh, and I said
I count fifties, all in hundreds, that's that time flow baby
I say stop it, no comparisons on that time now baby
And, oh yeah, I cannot keep it off my mind
Now, oh yeah, they cannot seem to keep up now
I been hidin' from attention on the rise
I didn't respond and now they see me on the rise
I got some sense up in my head now
I'm on my shit and I'm not scared now

[Verse 2]
Tryna do better, they know that I'm wit' it
I kill every nigga, I listen to critics
I see what they sayin' and I know I'm not trippin'
How the fuck can you just put me in that position
They postin' that shit, tryna send me to prison
How the fuck do I supposed to take care of my children
I be flippin' that money, it stack to the ceiling
Why the fuck should I care and I know that I'm with it?
Let a nigga come try me, it's gon' be a murder
How the fuck I'ma die with no snake in my circle
How the fuck he gon' do when this nigga a serpent
He claim he a boss, but this nigga a worker
If I nut in that bitch, it's gon' cum 'cause I'm fertile
That's as far as it go, it won't go any further
Ride in the car on the back of the curtains
If I beat it, the fuck, Man I might as well dirt her

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause I'm riding in a new Maybach, yeah
Walk with a whole lotta racks, yeah
Tote on a whole lotta straps, yeah
Push a nigga shit way back, yeah
Heart cold as a bitch, no cap, yeah
Fuck nigga play get splat, yeah
Fuck what they say, state facts, yeah
Kill the whole world with these racks, yeah
I feel I'm right, they say that I been wrong my whole life
Thought that was life, but since it's not, I keep my soul tight
'Cause I came from the bottom
Can't make you forever be with somebody
'Til the day I'm not heard, I'ma stack every dollar
I'ma blow out the brain, when I feel that I got 'em

[Chorus]
I count fifties, all in hundreds, that's that time flow baby
I say stop it, no comparisons on that time now baby
And, oh yeah, I cannot keep it off my mind
Now, oh yeah, they cannot seem to keep up now
I been hidin' from attention on the rise
I didn't respond and now they see me on the rise
I got some sense up in my head now
I'm on my shit and I'm not scared now

[Intro]
Playboy on this bitch but he ain't playin' though
Go, now I can't be saved
No matter what I do they say that I'm wrong
Everybody postin' shit that could put me in a cage
That shit so hurtful they gon' drag me 'til they see me go

[Verse]
When they bring up my name they gon' speak on the problems
How the fuck I'm gon' know that she lovin' somebody?
How the fuck you gon' say I'm beatin' on somebody?
'Fore I tend to that shit I'd step on somebody
I got money to make, I just gotta deposit
I'ma hop on a beat like a vet, I'ma ride it
Everything that you say it you know that I got it
I come from the streets, I'm not worried 'bout nobody
It's enough that I'm here by myself and you know how to touch me
Trust gon', thought you loved me
You postin' that shit so you really sayin' fuck me
Keep tellin' me shit like they tryna corrupt me
I ain't do not a thing, that's a regular problem
Everyday gettin' cussed out by my mama
Herpes in my blood and that shit got me cryin'
I really got feelings, you see without science
Somebody ain't real, I'ma cut my alliance
I been through this shit now they tryna rewind it
I bury my dirt now they tryna go find it
Confirm everything, they'll never confide it
While they focus on this and children out here dyin'
But they say I promote it, they say I slang iron
They done said plenty shit, that was time after time
But I know what I know, motherfuck all the lies
I see I cannot change my time, what's left?
And I know they do not care, they gon' ride the wave (oh yeah)
And you see I do not care, gave her everything
Fuck everybody changed and fuck all these niggas ain't true to the game
Motherfuck what they on, shoot 'em all in their body
I'm only 18 and they talk like I'm 80
Never knew it'd be this, startin' to hate that I made it
I don't fuck with that ho, I don't care 'bout that baby
If you cheated you cheated, go fuck him again
On my soul if I could I'd kill him again
Nigga do what you want 'cause you never could win
All this money in my arm and I focused on friends
And they not a friend, if they let you do that and embarrass yourself
I won't say that I did it and perish myself
If I go back to jail that's 10 on my belt
You can't say that I don't 'cause you how that I felt
When it come down to you I don't care 'bout myself
When you given attention, you're killin' yourself
Stop respondin', play the hand that you're dealt
'Cause you know I feel like fuck 'em and I'm thuggin' for real
'Cause I know, if I fuck up my judge gon' touch me for real
So after tonight I ain't postin' nothin' else
Cherish my life with a plaque on the shelf
The love that I got, I'ma wait 'til it melt
Rather knock someone down before they'd help, bitch

[Outro]
Man fuck the media, how the fuck y'all keep slanderin' my name, I'm 18
Bitch I don't think I did nothin' that wrong
And shit if I did whoever ain't feelin' this shit, what it is nigga, what you want?
Bitch you know what I'm on nigga, pussy ass boy
Bitch you better go get some money ya heard me?
'Cause aye, the day shit something ever do happen to me I know what the fuck I did
I don't owe nobody shit, ya hear me?
But I don't understand how y'all could just steady run y'all mouth about one person
No matter how bad I try to do right they gon' blame me anyway
And guess what?
Bitch y'all can't play me how y'all played him, 'cause guess what?
For one you ain't gon' make me stress, for one, bitch, I'ma forever get shit off my chest
I ain't worried but nothin', that shit don't hurt me, ya heard me?
Bitch I got my own problems and I'm happy with who I am
I wouldn't have said what I said if I wasn't happy with who I am
Ya heard me? I accept myself before anybody do
Nigga fuck you, I don't know you anyway, you ain't grow up with me bitch
I ain't perfect, you ain't perfect
Bitch I'm acceptable to myself tho'
Ya hear me? and I know somebody'll love me before your dawg ass do, yeah
Fuck the media and fuck the shaderoom too, bitch, broke ass muthafucka, ho

You can try to cuff, I let it up and bust your brain

[Chorus]
Choppers out, many men, baow, baow
Baby girl, I need that fan 'cause I'm hot now (I need that fan)
Broke ass niggas with that playin', they get shot down (That playin')
Plenty money, bitch, come on my land, see what I got now

[Verse]
Get shorty on them Xans, she get to spinnin' like a lighthouse
I'm walkin' through the mall, I'm tryna figure what the hype 'bout
You dumb lil' nigga, I ain't with that talkin', you'll get piped down
Shorty tryna fuck, I told her hurry and come pull up now
She said, "Where you get your car? 'Cause I like it"
I said, "That's funny, it don't cost that much"
She said, "Why you totin' that gun? I'd rather you just fight, kid"
'Cause the day I put it down'll be the day I'm out of luck
Bitch, give me the recipe, this shit is gettin' the best of me
I need a beat through the headphones
This money, it ain't shit to me, your bitch'll dig a ditch for me
Plus he'll bat you in your shit with that chrome (Bitch, lay down)
I pulled up, jumped out, loaded, geeked
Bitch, don't come approach the heat
I'm focused, nigga, what the fuck you on? (What you on, bro?)
Two hundred thousand in the bag on me
Fortnite is the last release
They got the nerve to still be dissin' in they songs
They ain't even on

[Chorus]
Choppers out, many men, baow, baow
Baby girl, I need that fan 'cause I'm hot now ('Cause I'm hot now)
Broke ass niggas with that playin', they get shot down
Plenty money, bitch, come on my land, see what I got now

[Post-Chorus]
She said, "Where you get your car? 'Cause I like it"
I said, "That's funny, it don't cost that much"
Niggas wanna test us, 45 sidekick
I hope these fuck niggas came with some luck
Keep up, I like it, drive me all insane
Niggas want to test us, 45 sidekick
You can try to cuff, I let it up and bust your brain

[Outro]
Mmh, ah
Choppers out, many men, baow, baow

Broke ass niggas with that playin', they get shot down

[Intro]
DJ Swift on the track
I turned the preacher daughter bad, I think I'm a devil
These niggas know what up, know I'm 'bout whateva
I'm in the streets, I keep that heat, you know that I be steppin'

[Verse 1]
I miss the Nawf just like my granny, my heart in them trenches
Yo' girl gon' cheat on you for nothing, so I'm done with these bitches
I think about it every minute, ain't stoppin' my mission
On my payroll I got hittas, I pay 'em commision
Interrogated by detectives, won't tell 'em I did it
I told Montana that I love him, on Dave I meant it
Put twenty thousand on his head, they catch him, I send it
Get on my knee on side the bed like "Father, forgive me"
Was sellin' weed, fucked up my profit, I ain't make a dolla
The fame gettin' to my niggas, I cut off my partners
Before I call on you, I put my trust up in this choppa
Movin' like he can't get touched real quick, I bet I stop 'em
Nigga ain't give me shit but hand out like I owe him something
I don't give a fuck, if we step together, I'll show you something
Bitches think they slick, they all deceive so I'll never love 'em
Bre was my first love but she changed so I'll never trust her

[Bridge]
This the files of a nigga who ain't neva bleed
This the story of a child who was in them streets
Why the fuck I'm taking care of them? They ain't do shit for me
Why the fuck I'm showing you so much love?
And bitch you leaving me

[Verse 2]
Keandre dead, the only thing I think about is Tyler
I'm full of pain but wake up every morning and I'm smilin'
They think I'm dumb, you got me fucked up, I got plenty knowledge
They don't give a fuck 'bout how I feel, they don't know my problems
Just 'cause you around me, I ain't forget 'bout everything you said
I let some shots off in the air for my niggas dead
Do anything in the world for you, I'm livin' red
Showin' love to them niggas, they might bust my head
Mad 'bout a gun, but for a fact bitch I won't do you nothin'
Mad that I'm up but you remember, you ain't give me nothing
I ain't give up on my mission, fuck you mean bitch? I was steady hustlin'
Handin' all you niggas money bitch, and I was steady strugglin'
Montana know about my pain and everything I told him
I told him watch what he was saying, but shit I had to fold him
Up in that cell, bitch I was cryin' with no one to hold me
YoungBoy a soldier, I remember what my grampa told me

[Chorus]
Batty bwoy if you cross, I'ma take your life
I'm full of drugs so I'ma die if I get caught tonight
Tell my lil' brother and my sons it's gon' be alright
NBA until the end, it's a way of life
Young nigga fillin' up his arm with some heroin
He was abandoned as a child screamin', "Red rum"
You spell it backwards, what that mean? Nigga, murder
Livin' wrong and right, trustin' nobody 'til his time come
Yo' ex just exposed you, now you mad like I was neva here
Where I come from I gotta keep this bitch up on my hip
Momma forgive me for all them times I use to trip
Know it's a purpose in this world why I need to live

[Interlude]
It ain't too long
Y'all don't give a fuck 'bout me, bitch
I did something for all y'all, y'all got me fucked up
Off the flap I ain't gotta smile in nobody face
Y'all tell me 'bout all y'all problems, y'all don't ask how I'm feelin' huh?
Bitch I been feelin' like I'm finna die, bitch I cry alone
This for all, this for all them young niggas who gone
And all the people who miss they babies, you heard me?
Fuck everybody who ain't mine, y'all ain't making my life no betta, gang

[Chorus]
Young nigga fillin' up his arm with some heroin
He was abandoned as a child screamin', "Red rum"
You spell it backwards, what that mean? Nigga, murder
Livin' wrong and right, trustin' nobody 'til his time come
Batty bwoy if you cross I'ma take your life
I'm full of drugs so I'ma die if I get caught tonight
Tell my lil' brother and my sons it's gon' be alright
NBA until the end, it's a way of life

[Intro]
Free my niggas out the can
Nigga, this that crazy man
I ain't even put no effort, crazy man

[Chorus]
Draw down with that Glock, bitch don't make no sound
Say somethin', might get shot bitch, face down to the ground
I ain't got no respect aye, you might think I'm dumb
I'm just 17, with a whole lotta money
Fuck you, bitch I hopped up out that coupe
Tell me hoe, if you don't like me why you worried about what I do
You ain't see the car I pulled up in so you might think I flew (Tell me why you say that YoungBoy?)
Cause bitch I'm flyer than your dude

[Verse]
If you think I fuck with that lil hoe, then you a fool
I ain't got no education, I dropped out of school
No security with me so I'm strapped up with that tool
Try to take my jewelry off and you gon' make the news, bitch
Cuban links around my neck, it cost me 22, bitch
Audemar Piguet, coulda' went and bought a school, bitch
Went to Neiman Marcus for my pants and my shoes, bitch
Five thousands dollars, what I paid for the whole fit
I just took a loss so I'm goin' on a heist bitch (Heist)
Hold a tool in yo face like Chino do a bike bitch
Too much money on me for to raise my hands and fight, bitch
Thunder in my clip, fuck around get hit with light, bitch
Bang

[Chorus]
Draw down with that Glock, bitch don't make no sound
Say somethin', might get shot, bitch face down to the ground
I ain't got no respect aye, you might think I'm dumb
I'm just 17, with a whole lotta money
Fuck you, bitch I hopped up out that coupe
Tell me hoe, if you don't like me why you worried about what I do
You ain't see the car I pulled up in so you might think I flew (Tell me why you say that YoungBoy?)
Cause bitch I'm flyer than your dude

[Intro]
Probably in yo city, yeah

[Verse 1]
Private number call my phone say that I'ma kill ya
I told that nigga I ain't hiding, I'm probably in yo city
I keep it with me, pull up on me and shit gone get wicked
All this shit these niggas doing I swear that I don't feel them
11 thousand 'round my neck and that's just up in chains
10 bands up in my pocket fresh up out the bank
You ain't my roun pussy nigga, you don't feel my pain
This shit I spit on tracks straight facts
It ain't a fucking game
It ain't a song that I write I don't think about Dave
I walk on stage, thousand people screamin' my name
He probably think I owed him something
I don't owe him a thing (nah)
Bitch, you gone make me show you something
You go against the grain
Send my niggas to bust you up since you think that I'm playing
One night we hit two back to back
Like nigga what you sayin'? (Nigga what you sayin'?)
I cut the barrel, make it short, got that from 'cross the track
Catch you slippin' down bad and we gone bust your ass (bust your ass)
My OG say 'cause you'll shoot that don't make you a man
It's how you play your hand or react when you in that jam (jam)
This for my niggas dead and gone and the ones in the can
I'ma forever hold it down, forever take a stand

[Chorus]
You say you looking for me, nigga?
I ain't hiding 'bout it
Drop yo nuts and play with me, get touched
I could bet 5 on it
That's on my mama, all us 'bout that drama (bitch, we slanging iron 'bout it)
Reppin' like you step, we really spare (these niggas lying 'bout it)
50 round choppa for whoever want it
You know how we comin'
Run up on ya, put this bitch up on ya, put this bitch up on ya
Shit get gutta, gotta stay up on it
Never know who out to get ya
Better watch yo homies

[Verse 2]
Wake up every morning tryna get a dollar (dollar)
When you down and ain't got nothing
They ain't got no holla
Gotta get this shit for my lil' boys
Gotta get it for my mama
You better not short me out my money
I want every dollar (or else)
I'ma bust yo fucking head 'cause I don't play that
We gone load up with them cuttas
We gone swerve where you stay at
Can't keep hitting the block like this, YoungBoy
Too many people on that
I don't give a motherfuck
Ain't stopping 'til I get my shit back (believe that)
Nigga said spin again when the sun down
All night we gone wait 'til he come out
See his ass, hop out on him with the Glock out
What it is?
It's a man down
Where I'm from I was taught never stand down
Once my youngin spin, believe I'm coming back around
Suppressor on the front take away the sound (suppressor on the front take away the sound)

[Chorus]
You say you looking for me, nigga?
I ain't hiding 'bout it (I ain't hide)
Drop yo nuts and play with me, get touched
I could bet 5 on it
That's on my mama, all us 'bout that drama (bitch, we slanging iron 'bout it)
Reppin' like you step, we really spare (these niggas lying 'bout it)
50 round choppa for whoever want it
You know how we comin'
Run up on ya, put this bitch up on ya, put this bitch up on ya
Shit get gutta, gotta stay up on it
Never know who out to get ya
Better watch yo homie

Now word around town, niggas say that I'ma get it

Nigga all I know is murder, swear to God that I'm with it
And everything I talk up in my songs, you know I live it

They say that they want all of us, we right here in the city
You bitches don't want war with us, everybody gon' get it
Want a nigga for to follow us and he gon' end up missin'
Yeah, four choppas in the car, 400 shots up in the rental

And don't think that we ain't gon' get you cause you stay in Denham

[Bridge]

You know that I ain't hidin', yeah

It's gon' be a homicide, yeah

You bitches don't want war with us
You niggas don't want war with us

[Verse 2]
My lil' partner, he go to work, he don't be fuckin' with nobody
You gon' die since you put a bullet up inside his body
All through Baton Rouge, nigga we been ridin' with them choppas
If I catch him, I'ma pop him, give a fuck 'bout what they hollerin'
Since I was a baby I was born to be violent
I'ma bust yo' fuckin' head and my confidence on highly
I be thinkin' 'bout killin' a nigga every time I'm smilin'
All my niggas wildin'
My girl be scared but she know that I'm bout it
Montana out his body, sayin' a nigga ain't gon' fuck with us

When you with me you ain't got nothing to worry bout
Come jump in with me yea, and we gone ride out
We gone ride out , we gone ride , (skrt) we gone ride out

[Intro: YoungBoy Never Broke Again]
Can I see that lighter? Thank you, um
Do you think, um, I can make them, like
Feel me on this song, like, without saying too much?
I kept on begging you to stay
I couldn't hold on, so please forgive me, I wasn't strong
I take my lick and I move on
Fuck them niggas for life, the way they did me wrong

[Chorus: YoungBoy Never Broke Again]
I was blind when they crossed me (Yeah)
I was blind when they crossed me (I was blind)
I was blind when they crossed me (Oh I)
I was blind when they crossed me

[Verse 1: YoungBoy Never Broke Again]
I could put this shit on everything
I had came out the back door
For this shit, man, I was struggling for so long
Pray every day, protect myself, and tote that fucking pole
I mind my business, I'm not like these niggas or these hoes
Been deceived, I don't know nothin' but throw them B's
I tell lil' shorty come be on the winning team, please
I told that bitch she best believe
I told that boy it's 4K Trey, I tote that beam
Oh, how the fuck you do me wrong?
Left me for a nigga that wasn't worth it like me
I put in work to be with you, he ain't deserve it like me
I was low-key in a coupe, they put the word out on me

[Chorus: YoungBoy Never Broke Again & Plies]
I was blind when they crossed me
I was blind when they crossed me
I was blind when they crossed me
I was blind when they crossed me
I was blind when they crossed me (I was blind)
I was blind when they crossed me (Yeah, ayy, YB)
I was blind when they crossed me (This a Plies check-in, bro)
I was blind when they crossed me (Know this shit took cash to drop)

[Verse 2: Plies]
I been used by niggas, I been used by bitches
One thing I ain't never do was get in my feelings
Most of these niggas never been in no trenches
None of these hoes, don't put in my business
I don't need no nigga, I don't need no bitch
'Cause if I get locked up they ain't gon' send me shit
Got a bag, I'll put it on your head, lil' bitch
Y'all broke ass niggas can't tell me shit
L-O-V-E, that ain't me
M-O-N-E-Y, that's me
I don't trust y'all niggas far as I can see
Most y'all hoes fuckin' more than me
Can't fuck with everybody what I learned in these streets
Niggas only show up when it's time to eat
Jump in that water, better hope you can swim
'Cause I'm tellin' you, lil' nigga, I'm playing for keeps
Most of you broke hoes ain't got shit
Want me to fuck, gotta pay for this dick
Only love I'm showing is to my fam
Tryna stay rich, give a fuck 'bout no 'Gram
I got gold now, ten mill' a month
Want me to save you, ho? I ain't the one
YB, YB, run it up
Most you fuck niggas talk too much

[Chorus: YoungBoy Never Broke Again]
I was blind when they crossed me (Yeah)
I was blind when they crossed me (I was blind)
I was blind when they crossed me (Oh I)
I was blind when they crossed me

[Verse 3: Lil Baby]
I'm in that 'Vette again (Slatt), I just went top speed
I should've knew they would cross me
They sit around, talk about me
We carry Dracos that chop trees (Yeah)
I get that bag and I put it up 'cause I know ain't shit free (Nah)
We was in love, I came and pulled up, I know she miss me
She ride that dick like a ten-speed
I'm with the gang, I can't switch teams
No more handcuffs, I wear APs
Take off my watch, let my wrist breathe
We been gettin' money and we been thuggin' since we was young boys
Now look at me, I just bought a foreign, the same one as YoungBoy
Go to my shows when I'm drunk, boy
My youngins, they shoot-out for fun
A convicted felon, I'm keeping my gun
It's just how we livin', we come from the slums
Now when the police pull up, we don't run
Young rich nigga, do what we want
Private jet so I'm sittin' in the front, yeah
How could you cross me? How could you cross me?
How could you cross me? How could you cross me?
How could you cross me? How could you cross me?
How could you cross me? How could you cross me?

[Chorus: YoungBoy Never Broke Again]
I was blind when they crossed me
I was blind when they crossed me
I was blind when they crossed me
I was blind when they crossed me
I was blind when they crossed me (I was blind)
I was blind when they crossed me (Yeah)
I was blind when they crossed me (Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
I was blind when they crossed me (When they crossed me)

[Pre-Chorus]
Your smile play a big part in why I want you
For your love, it ain't no tellin' what I won't do
Yeah, you bad, I guess that's why they hatin' on you
Why they mad? It's because they ain't got nothin' on you

[Chorus]
I ain't tryna waste your time
And I ain't tryna make you mine
But if it happen that's fine
I hope I learn to treat you right over the time

[Verse 1]
And I ain't lyin', I been droppin' bags on 'em packs to make that money stack
And I been tryna run it up so I can turn up on they ass
And you just came inside my life, don't make me put you in the past
People say shit make you wonder, I try hard to make you laugh
Let's see how these bitches like you in a new Birkin bag
I could flew you on a jet with private thoughts to make it back
It's way too early, but they talkin', so I hit you with that sack
Jump out the back, I'm like, "Lay back," the way I pop out with that Mac
Remember when you was mine
I'm thinkin' 'bout all the times I hit the blunt to get that shit from out my head, like, "yeah, yeah"
I used to tell you "you fine"
I'm sad I can't press rewind
How I been feelin', I been scared to say the shit that's unsaid

[Chorus]
I ain't tryna waste your time
And I ain't tryna make you mine
But if it happen that's fine
I hope I learn to treat you right over the time

[Verse 2]
Thought I was pressure, I ain't lyin', and that's a fact
She told me, "Baby, look, relax"
Wrapped up her hair and showed me how to hit it from the front and back
I say "slow down," she told me tap, I'm steady pullin' on her hair
But we just friends, I got some pieces of my heart I'm tryna map
You like, "Keep it real," I won't tell no lie, I'll tell you how I feel
My people with me keep the steel, want you to help me change, for real
Ain't speakin' on my past because I'm tryna lose that pain, for real
I'm like bae this ain't a game, for real
We done bust a nigga brain, for real

[Pre-Chorus]
Your smile play a big part in why I want you
For your love, it ain't not tellin' what I won't do
Yeah, you bad, I guess that's why they hatin' on you
Why they mad? It's because they ain't got nothin' on you

[Chorus]
I ain't tryna waste your time
And I ain't tryna make you mine
But if it happen that's fine
I hope I learn to treat you right over the time

[Outro]
Baby I'm a real Slime
We might fight from time to time
Make me feel some shit I never felt and I won't let you down
Baby I'm a real Slime

Make me feel some shit I never-yeah, haha

I ain't get to roll no weed, I ain't get to roll no Swishers
I was locked up on Christmas, ain't get to see my niggas
Ain't get to hug my mama, couldn't even give her no kisses
Can't even post on my Instagram 'cause these pussy niggas be snitching
Everybody acting suspicious, might probably say that I'm tripping
When I'm all alone in my jail cell, I tend to get in my feelings
And all I smoke is that loud, don't pass me no midget
And I'ma smoke all of my pain away 'cause that's the only thing that gon' heal it
I don't understand these women who go around pretending
As if they really fuck with me, so I love 'em all from a distance
'Cause the same bitch say she down to ride be the main one who tricking
Got Molly mixed with promethazine 'cause every time

[Chorus]
I wake up in the morning, I got murder on my mind
AK-47's, MAC-11, Glocks, and nines
And all these pussy niggas hating, tryna knock me off my grind

Bitch, I got murder on my mind (Bitch, I got murder on my mind)
I got murder on my mind (On my mind)
I got murder on my mind (I got murder on my mind)
I got murder on my mind, I got murder on my mind

[Verse 2]
Yellow tape around his body, it's a fucking homicide
His face is on a T-shirt and his family traumatized
I didn't even mean to shoot him, he just caught me by surprise
I reloaded my pistol, cocked it back, and shot him twice
His body dropped down to the floor and he got teardrops in his eyes
He grabbed me by my hands and said he was afraid to die
I told him it's too late, my friend, it's time to say goodbye
And he died inside my arms, blood all on my shirt

[Chorus]
Wake up in the morning, I got murder on my mind
AK-47's, MAC-11, Glocks, and nines
And all these pussy niggas hating, tryna knock me off my grind
But I can't let 'em do it, I got murder on my mind

[Chorus: Kanye West & YNW Melly]

This bitch switched up my whole mentality
This girl, she got mixed personalities
One day she's happy, then she mad at me

[Refrain: YNW Melly & Kanye West]
Say you want someone

[Intro]
I thank God for everything
Mind on my murder (Mind on my murder)
Young Nigga World, bitch
Mind on my murder, murder
"Murder on My Mind," part two, hey

[Verse 1]
Sky is getting red, body getting cold
Losing hella blood, Lord, please save my soul
If I have to die, don't know where I'll go
I don't want to die, I'm only 10 years old, oh
My mama cried
Yellow tape around my body, it's a homicide
And he told me it was accidental, by surprise
Ambulances everywhere and I just pray that I survive

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause baby, it's a homicide, oh, a homicide
He just shot me and I dropped down to the floor
He said I caught him by surprise, I caught him by surprise
He was shell-shocked and he claimed he didn't know
I grabbed his hand 'cause I was terrified, said I was scared to die
He just watched my blood spill out and die slow
I looked him right inside the eyes, he looked inside my eyes
Asked him would I survive? He shook his head no

[Chorus]
Mind on my murder, yeah, murder, huh, murder, huh
Mind on my murder, yeah, murder, ayy, murder, hey
Mind on my murder, yeah, murder, hey, murder, huh
Mind on my murder, hey, mind on my murder

[Verse 2]
Yellow tape around my body, it's a homicide
Never thought my day one friend would be the one to take my life
And he ain't even shoot me once, this nigga shot me twice
And I dropped down to the floor and I had teardrops in my eyes
Never thought a home invasion would've costed me my life
All I wanted was a mouth full of golds and my neck and wrist with ice
But now I just got murdered while I go in paradise
Just sing this chorus with me twice

[Chorus]
Mind on my murder, hey, murder, hey, murder, huh
Mind on my murder, hey, murder, hey, murder, hey
Mind on my murder, hey, murder, hey, murder, hey
Mind on my murder, hey, mind on my murder

[Verse 3]

Suck on that bitch, I want blood like I'm Dracula
Whoa-whoa, suck on it slow, fuck that lil' bitch on the floor
You know it's Melly the Menace, the clip is extended
You fuck with me, life will get ended

Pull up on a nigga, it's a fuckin' M-1
Free my nigga Trell, he just caught an M-1

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause baby, it's a homicide, oh, a homicide
He just shot me and I dropped down to the floor
He said I caught him by surprise, I caught him by surprise
He was shell-shocked and he claimed he didn't know
I grabbed his hand 'cause I was terrified, said I was scared to die
He just watched my blood spill out and die slow
I looked him right inside the eyes, he looked inside my eyes
Asked him would I survive? He shook his head no

[Chorus]
Mind on my murder, murder, huh, murder, huh
Mind on my murder, ayy, murder, ayy, murder, huh

100K, remain solid
I'm sorry, won't right my wrongs

[Chorus]
Mama, please don't you cry, I'm sorry
I just caught some time, I'll be home soon
It won't be long, I promise
I will be okay, just wipe those
Tears off of your face, I'm sorry
I won't right my wrongs, I'm guilty
Lord, have mercy, please forgive me
Mama, please don't you cry, I'm sorry

[Verse 1]
One hundred and forty-five days, I'm counting
Tryna hold on but the time goes slowly
Two hundred and twenty-five ice cold showers
Hurricane hit my cell, ain't get no power
Tryna walk a narrow straight path is a battle
Kinda hard to walk when you're chained in shackles
My soul bleeds through these four walls
My heart aches after phone calls

[Chorus]
Mama, please don't you cry, I'm sorry
I just caught some time, I'll be home soon
It won't be long, I promise
I will be okay, just wipe those
Tears off of your face, I'm sorry
I won't right my wrongs, I'm guilty
Lord, have mercy, please forgive me
Mama, please don't you cry, I'm sorry

[Verse 2]
Give you my heart that's filled with pain, give me my freedom
Take off these shackles, they hurt my hands, let me go home
Cold shower, cold bath, cold food, cold slab
Only makes a cold heart
Cold shower, cold slab, cold food, cold bath
Only makes a cold

[Chorus]
Mama, please don't you cry, I'm sorry
I just caught some time, I'll be home soon
It won't be long, I promise

Tears off of your face, I'm sorry
I won't right my wrongs, I'm guilty
Lord, have mercy, please forgive me
Mama, please don't you cry, I'm sorry
Mama, please don't you cry, I'm sorry

[Outro]
Barbed wire, best friend became the barbed wire (Barbed wire)
Chains broken by the barbed wire (Barbed wire)

Cold shower, cold slab, cold food, cold bath (Yeah, falling down)
Only makes a cold heart

[Verse 1]
So heartless bitch, I hate you

Baby girl, I'm from the G, you know we home invade
Baby girl, I love you like I love that baby K
Baby girl, I love you, girl, you got that sweet cake
Sweet cake (Uh), yeah, sweet cake
I might pack you up and put you in my briefcase
Baby girl,  you so damn fine, I think I like you
But I never ever, ever, ever would wife you
Got to think twice, got to think three times
'Cause the last bitch broke my heart like four times
No, I'm the love no more
All the Ferragamo, Dolce Gabbana, Christian Dior
All the Giuseppe, Givenchy, and the Gucci I bought
Tryna say I broke your heart and tryna say it's my fault
Had the key to your heart, but you switched the vault
Damn, I thought you the one, but lil' baby, I thought

[Chorus]
I'm not playing fair with my love no more
Feelings I just can't ignore
Heartbreaks, we been here times before
So baby, so long, so long

Mama come here and sit down, let's talk

Swear it'll only take a minute, I won't stop shootin' 'til it finish, yeah
And I don't wanna see you cry, a lot of fuck niggas wanna see me die, so
How does it feel to know

Other side of the grave when you slangin' iron, talk about it
These fuck niggas want me dead, two bullets in my head
Doin' life in fed, fucked up, pockets in the red

[Chorus]
So it's never a wrong time to slang that iron
And I gotta shoot first 'cause I know that these pussy plottin' on killin' me
And I really don't feel the way I once felt about school
Ma it's not you, it's me, I'm
Just so fucked 'bout this street, whoa-oh-oh
It's never a wrong time to slang that iron
And I gotta shoot first 'cause I know that these pussy plottin' on killin' me
And I really don't feel the way I once felt about school
Ma it's not you, it's me, I'm
Just so fucked 'bout this street, whoa-oh-oh

[Verse 2]
And I know it's hard but I gotta shoot 'em, ain't no killin' me
'Cause it's never a wrong time, a wrong time to slang that
Pull up with that Glock, cock it back with thirty shots
And I, I get to shooting, I, I get to shooting
Imagine one of your opps pullin' up
Wettin' up your block, and you get popped
I just can't do it, so sometimes a fuck boy gotta die, ooh
Now these niggas dyin', oh, oh-whoa, oh-whoa
It's never a wrong time

[Chorus]
It's never a wrong time to slang that iron
And I gotta shoot first 'cause I know that these pussy plottin' on killin' me
And I really don't feel the way I once felt about school
Ma it's not you, it's me, I'm
Just so fucked up 'bout these streets, whoa-oh-oh
And I know it's hard but I gotta shoot 'em, ain't no killin' me
'Cause it's never a wrong time, a wrong time to slang that iron

Ayy, where all of my City Girls at?
North Miami, where it all goes down
Heard it ain't no pity where you're at
And your dad don't know that your soul in lost and found

[Refrain]
She don't want love
She don't love no one but herself
All she really cares about is a lace-front weave
And the boutiques from Chanel

[Verse 2]
What about lust?
What about lust? Do you trust yourself?
Anytime you walk out the door
It's a bag full of ones and lame nigga under your belt
But I won't judge
I won't judge, don't judge yourself
Promise I'm not here to burden you
I'm here to help (Nah, for real)

[Chorus]
If you're looking for someone to change your life, change your life
I can be the one who can change your life
If you're looking for someone who can change your life
Baby, I can be the one that can change your life
And I know that you're young and you're filled with life
Ain't no need to be ashamed, I don't judge nor bite
If you're looking for someone who can change your life
Ain't no need to cry, baby, wipe your eyes

[Refrain]
She don't want love
She don't love no one but herself
Only thing she cares about is a lace-front weave
And the boutiques from Chanel
She don't want love
She don't want love from no one else
She don't want love
She don't love no one but herself

[Verse 3]
I wanna amuse you, oh, let me use you
All for the good, not for the bad, I won't abuse you
Won't say I need you, just scared to lose you
Put down your pride, see through your eyes, somebody bruised you
Know what you been through, I won't avenge you
Act like you mad, act like you sad yet, but yet, pretend to
Say you love honesty, but yet, it offends you
Just hit my line, I got some lovin' I could lend you

[Chorus]
If you're looking for someone to change your life, change your life
I can be the one who can change your life
If you're looking for someone who can change your life
Baby, I can be the one that can change your life
And I know that you're young and you're filled with life
Ain't no need to be ashamed, I don't judge nor bite
If you're looking for someone who can change your life
Ain't no need to cry, baby, wipe your eyes

[Refrain]
She don't want love
She don't love no one but herself
All she really cares about is a lace-front weave

She don't want love
All she love is herself

[Intro]
Whoa, uh
Mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm

But don't you know that it's something that I ain't never fear

So, why you never ever show no love to me
Don't say a word, just get on top and make sweet love to me
Oooh, I know, I know you fuck with me

Never met a real street nigga that's exactly what I told her
Uh, oooh, she from Atlanta, Georgia
You know my car don't run on keys, they run on Florida water
Bad hoes, superfine
So divine, just be mine...
Ayy, ayy, oh no, if I'm catching feelings, do I let her go
'Cause you know...

Young Nigga World, young nigga wavy
World, young nigga wavy

[Verse 1]
I ain't get to roll no leaves, ain't get to roll no swishers
I was locked up on Christmas, ain't get to see my sistas
Ain't get to hug my mama, couldn't even give her no kisses
Can't even post on my Instagram 'cause these playa haters be snitching
Everybody acting suspicious, might prolly say that I'm tripping
When I'm all alone in my jail cell, I tend to get in my feelings
And all I smoke is that loud, don't pass me no midget
And I'ma smoke all of my pain away 'cause that the only thing that gone' heal it
I don't understand these women who go around pretending
As if they really mess with me, so I love 'em all from a distance
'Cause the same chick say she down to ride be the main one who tricking
Ain't tryna catch no felony but every time

[Chorus]
I wake up in the morning I got mischief on my mind
Jumping over fences tryna dodge police and nine
And all these playa haters jocking tryna knock me off my grind
But I can't let 'em do it, I got mischief on my mind
I got mischief on my mind (I got mischief on my mind), I got mischief on my mind (mischief on my mind)
I got mischief on my mind (I got mischief on my mind), I got mischief on my mind
I got mischief on my mind

[Verse 2]
Yellow tape around his body, it's a freaking homicide
His face is on a T-Shirt and his family traumatized
I didn't even mean to hurt 'em, he just caught me by surprise
I reloaded my ******, cocked it back, and ***** him twice
His body dropped down to the floor and he got teardrops in his eyes
He grabbed me by my hands and said he was afraid to die
I told 'em it's too late my friend, it's time to say "Goodbye"
And he died inside my arms, blood all on my shirt

[Chorus]
Wake up in the morning I got mischief on my mind
Jumping over fences tryna dodge police and nine
And all these playa haters jocking tryna knock me off my grind
But I can't let 'em do it, I got mischief on my mind
I got mischief on my mind (I got mischief on my mind), I got mischief on my mind (I got mischief on my mind)
I got mischief on my mind (I got mischief on my mind), I got mischief on my mind
I got mischief on my mind

[Verse 3]
Ball like tarantula, Menace a animal
Melly a savage, no he not no amateur
Persian named Angela, made love on camera
Look how I damage the flesh, flesh
I might just deal the boy
Don't wanna deal the boy
Bake 'em up, say he want beef, we gone grill the boy
Grill the boy
I'm bleeding so red I might dip his flesh in it and spill the boy (slatt)
Woah, mischief on my mind
Woah, I got mischief on my mind

[Outro]
Wake up in the morning I got mischief on my mind
Jumping over fences dodging police slanging nine
And all these playa haters jocking tryna knock me off my grind
But I can't let 'em do it, I got mischief on my mind
I got mischief on my mind, I got mischief on my mind
I got mischief on my mind, I got mischief on my mind

[Pre-Chorus]

Better stop that talkin' 'fore we pull up and pursue that boy
Huh, huh, sue that boy
He shook my hand, hell nah, what the fuck, I might just fill 'em
Ride for you, die for you

Hit the bitch, if the bitch older listen to Drake
Well let me introduce young nigga world
Now let me introduce you

[Chorus]
Hi, how are you doin', I would like to try

[Verse 1: TONK Wit Tha Gift]
Jesus, I know you hear me when I pray, so I'ma keep prayin'
Had to turn my back on the devil, I couldn't keep playin'
I'm tryna make it to Heaven, and I know I'ma make it
But I gotta watch out for my soul, Lucifer tryna take it
Snakes is creepin' in the grass, I got my lawnmower
Sometimes I'm ready to die and go to Heaven, the Lord know
I just want peace in my mind, body, and my soul
And in the end, I just wanna walk the streets of gold

[Verse 2: TONK Wit Tha Gift]
I don't write rhymes, I grab the pen and let my soul talk
Walkin' with Jesus, he saved my soul, this a soul walk
'Member when the only thing I used to do was sell drugs
Now my soul cryin' to the Lord, that's the real plug
Thuggin' and druggin' and stealin' cars is my history
Now my soul cryin' to the Lord, I got the victory
Was slippin' on razor blade alley, the alcohol river
Now I'm filled with the Holy Ghost and I make demons shiver

[Chorus: YNW Melly]
Can you hear me, Jesus?
I need to hear your voice again
Your rejoicement to my soul, it feeds it just like oxygen

Can you hear me, Jesus?
I need to hear your voice again
And I will keep on praying, and I promise I'll be waitin' on you
Waitin' on you
God, I promise that I'm waitin' on you, you
I promise that I'm waitin' on you (I promise that I'm waitin')
On you (I promise that I'll wait for)
On you (I promise that I'll wait for, I promise that I'll wait for)
I'll be waiting on you, woah (I promise that I'll wait for you, I promise that I'll wait for you)
I promise I'll be waiting on you

[Outro: TONK Wit Tha Gift]
They that wait on the Lord shall renew their strength
They shall mount up with wings as eagles
They shall run and not be weary
They shall walk and not faint
Lord, no matter what it take, no matter how long it take
I promise I'll be waiting for you, Jesus
I promise, Lord, no matter what it take

[Chorus]
Knee deep in that water, need a surfboard
Wipe them tears off your face, what you cryin' for?
What the hell, what the hell are you mad for?

Tell me baby, what are you mad for?
Wipe them tears off your face, what you sad for?
I give you everything you ask for
So tell me why the hell are you mad for?

Wipe them tears off your eyes, stop crying

Pull up with a stick, let it go at your fade
Fuckin' with my niggas, bet your ass get a raid

Everywhere we go, we trash you like a fuckin' disgrace

So tell me why you ain't ridin' for me

[Chorus]
What the hell, what the hell is you mad for?
Wipe them tears off your face, what you sad for?

[Chorus]
I ain't tryna get in my feelings, but damn (But damn)

And you mad at me about a bitch Instagram (Like damn)
Got me like, "What the fuck wrong with him?"

[Verse 1]
Tryna beef over some pussy, that's funny (That's funny)
Can't believe this ho made you her crash dummy
The way you act, that ho pussy better be squirtin' out money
Platinum diamond, VVS' payin' taxes or somethin'
But it's okay, I understand, you just couldn't keep it a hunnid
While you locked up somebody else shovin' that dick in her stomach
I can't be beefin' bout these bitches, bruh, this shit gettin' old
Knowin' that pussy stainless steel, but yet you treat it like gold
They been showin' me that these niggas ain't real (Ain't real, fuck nigga)
Get caught up with that time, they gon' squeal (Gon' squeal)
These bitches ain't shit, these niggas ain't real (Ain't real)
Keep playin', your ass fuck 'round and get killed
What's goin' on, bro, I heard you been trippin' (Was trippin')
I thought you kept it real from beginnin'
Until I heard that track you made and I came to some suspicions
I can't believe to my surprise, one of my woadies sneak dissin'

[Bridge]
Yeah, you turned cold, I can't fuck with you
It's like that Molly done turned you into a fuck nigga
Hold up, wait, bro, pose for the picture
You officially have been framed as a fuck nigga
And that's truth, this... ain't fuckin' with you at all
And Lil Baby snapped, but this fuck nigga ain't my dawg
That ain't my dawg no more
That ain't my dawg (No)
That ain't my dawg no more (Nah)

[Chorus]
I ain't tryna get in my feelings, but damn (But damn)
What's goin' on, bro? I thought you was fam (Was fam)
And you mad at me about a bitch Instagram (Like damn)
Got me like, "What the fuck wrong with'"

[Verse 2]
I can't be fuckin' with none of these niggas
'Cause all of these niggas be actin' like bitches
You know that I'm straight out of Indian River
I don't give no fuck about none of these niggas
We just tryna run up this mothafuckin' skrilla
All of my niggas, they really some killers
See you a pussy, I used to fuck with you
But then you turned cold on me, nigga what's up?
I cannot go, oh, oh like that (I can't go like that)
Can't believe you switched up like a ho like that
Like bruh, I know you ain't got many hoes like that
I would have let you have the bitch
I would have let you smash the bitch
I don't give a fuck, nigga (What?)
'Cause you're still a fuck nigga (What?)
And that time you let me hold your pistol
You should have bucked, nigga
Wait, I should've bucked you, nigga
But now I'm feelin' like fuck you, nigga (Fuck you)
And if this chopper ever catch you, it's hungry
It eat your bitch ass up for supper, nigga (Yum, yum, yum, yum)
Sometimes I wake up and I be in my feelings all night
Sometimes tell that I was reminiscin'
All of these bitches, they wasn't even missin' me
Now they all on me and they tryna kiss me
I thought that we were 51-50, but you could never be with us
These niggas claim they fuck with us, but really be the enemy

[Chorus]
I ain't tryna get in my feelings, but damn (But damn)
What's goin' on, bro? I thought you was fam (Was fam)
And you mad at me about a bitch Instagram (Like damn)
Got me like, "What the fuck wrong with him?"

[Outro]
Tryna beef over some pussy, that's funny (That's funny)
Can't believe this ho made you her crash dummy
The way you act, that ho pussy better be squirtin' out money

But it's okay, I understand, you just couldn't keep it a hunnid
And you just couldn't keep it a hunnid

Say you was on that shit but you ain't even gotta lie nigga
Swang the doors, drop the windows, then we empty clips
Big blood, big B's, but I don't envy crips
'Cause we in tune with the streets, big F&N
Pull up on me, we ain't gon' shoot you, we just gon' shoot your friend
Lil Melly fuck up the humanity
I already fucked the environment
And she had a baby from me, guess where she born? the city of Gifford
'Cause she know I'm a real nigga
She bounce on the dick like Tigger
I think she might die
'Cause this ain't a dick, this fire, hold up

Damn, I went to jail more than twice
More than three, more than four, more than five fuckin' times
Ask me 'bout it, I ain't never dropped no dime
Keep the change in my fuckin' pocket every time
Pull up and murder the bitch
Hop out with a Glock-26
I pull up in the coupe, let it hit
Stick together like Lilo and Stitch

Damn we really be robbin' for bricks
You don't really want beef with the clique

If you wanna fuck my gang

Shawty say she with it and she like my swang
Iron in what I trust, 'cause that's what I slang
You say you got death on your mind
Shut the fuck up, boy, you're tellin' to the nine
Load up the carbon, bust it at his eye
You niggas really be snitches in disguise

[Post-Chorus: YNW Melly]
I don't wanna take no losses so I'm playin' all for keeps
And my heart can't take no more of all this pain attackin' me
I don't wanna take no heartbreak so I'm playin' it for keeps
And my heart can't take no more of all this pain attackin' me

[Verse 1: YNW Melly]
I been through a lot of shit, yes, I done seen some crazy things
Every time I go to sleep I got some demons chasing me
And she told me it was real but the way that I'm feeling now
Is if I ever see her, I'ma go kapow

[Chorus: YNW Melly]
I just found out a new ingredient to death

[Verse 2: Fredo Bang]
Shawty say she like my squad
We gon' take her home and we pick that ass apart
She say she can take this rod
I'ma pull it out, just do your part
And I keep that stick and I'll squeeze, ho
Put it through his head like I'm tryna give him chemo

[Verse 3: YNW Melly]
Was the night before Christmas, I was with my niggas
Ridin' in a stolo, clutchin' on them triggers
They wouldn't let me squeeze, they wouldn't let me squeeze
You with Melly, crack your melon, you can get your lemon squeezed

[Verse 4: Fredo Bang]
I got a lemon squeeze on the nina
Dawg need the cheese to cut you down for that Velveeta
He talk like he got stripes, I guess he think he with Adidas
Hit him in his head, that's gon' make 'em all the sweeter
Hey sir, I don't fuck with snoopers
I got a gun, it's not an action movie, won't be bloopers
I need a party pack of Percs, don't be a party pooper
Big old titties on this gun, this bitch could work for Hooters

[Chorus: YNW Melly]
I just found out a new ingredient to death
I'ma give it all 'til it ain't nothin' left
Shawty wanna go 'cause I'm gettin' this check

Shut the fuck up, boy, you're tellin' to the nine
Load up the carbon, bust it at his eye
You niggas really be snitches in disguise

You must really think I'm stupid
Maybe it's time

[Verse 1]
Take away the big shirts, the tattoos, the sweatpants and vans
Okay, I don't wear no makeup, no purse in my hands
My resting bitch face is mistaken for the mean girl
But what if I told you there's nothing I want more in this world

[Chorus]
Than somebody who loves me naked
Someone who never asks for love, but knows how to take it
Are you that somebody who sees a wall and breaks it?
Are you ready to fight just to see what's lost behind my flaws?
Can you love me naked?

[Post-Chorus]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, naked
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, naked
Oh, woah, yeah, yeah

[Verse 2]
Might be a bitch in the mornin' so catch me at night time
Some of my friends think I'm moody but I think I'm just fine
I could be pissed but I'll act like I'm not
I really remember when I say I forgot
No matter how hard I try
To run away from love at the end of the night

[Chorus]
I need somebody who loves me naked
Someone who never asks for love but knows how to take it
Are you that somebody who sees a wall and breaks it?
Are you ready to fight just to see what's lost behind my flaws?
Can you love me naked?

[Post-Chorus]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, naked
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, naked

[Bridge]
I need someone who loves me when I wake up
Who thinks I'm beautiful when I'm lookin' fucked up
I want that perfect love, am I askin' too much?
Someone who shoots for the stars
Knowin' I think I'm not even good enough

[Chorus]
I need somebody who loves me naked (Who loves me naked)
Someone who never asks for love but knows how to take it (Knows how to take it)
Are you that somebody who sees a wall and breaks it?
Are you ready to fight just to see what's lost behind my flaws?
Can you love me naked?

[Post-Chorus]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, naked
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, naked

[Verse 1]
24 seconds, yeah, you better not stop
You got 24 seconds, can you beat the shot clock?
What you waitin' on, lil' daddy? I ain't got that much time
You seem anxious, you seem adamant but you ain't pressed my line
Wondering why, why, why (Oh why)

[Pre-Chorus]
When that nigga pull up on me, tell that nigga back, back
Don't you know all of these niggas wish that they could bag that?

You got 24 seconds and it's starting right now

[Chorus]
Shot clock
(Don't sleep, don't sleep, you gon' miss your opportunity)

Shot clock
(Like don't sleep, don't sleep, you gon' miss your opportunity)
Shot clock

[Verse 2]
Five years of dating, tired of being patient
What the fuck you're waiting for? Oh, yeah
It's a lot of niggas hating and I don't entertain 'em
But damn, you gotta give me more
(Shhh, I know, I know and I'm really trying, but...)
Oh-ohh, if you don't want it like me
I could think about a hundred things I could be doing right now
Than wasting my time with you, oh (Do-do)
Okay, okay, since you gotta have it your way (Do-do)
I'm have to start that clock on you (Do-do)
We gon' see what's up

[Pre-Chorus]
When that nigga pull up on me, tell that nigga back, back
Don't you know all of these niggas wish that they could bag that?
I'm just saying, boy, you're playing, you're gon' let it wind down (Wind down)
You got 24 seconds and it's starting right now (Right now, yeah-eah)

[Chorus]
Shot clock

[Outro]
L, Love
Add "-rs" and that's surely what we are
Flip it 'round, add "-ve" and let's see if this goes far
Full of chuckles and cuddles and sometimes, eye puddles
Compose love like we're Mozart

[Verse 1]
I gave you everything that every man says he wants
I cooked, I cleaned, I ironed your jeans, I was the one
I would listen to you when you sound stupid
Treat you like a winner even when you're losing
Now you got me feeling like shooting Cupid
'Cause you did me wrong

[Pre-Hook]
So when you come running back from the past you'll be out of time
Because I'm done with your ass, you know that you is out of line
And if you ever move on to another one that you find
I hope you fall and you break your heart like you broke mine

[Hook]
'Cause baby we're over
A thousand times over
Ain't no do-overs
It was nice to know you
But this love is over
A thousand times over
I hope the next girl you love ends up fucking you over
A thousand times over

[Verse 2]
I deserve everything that every girl says she needs
I need your heart, I need your time, your loyalty
Can't believe you caught me out here looking stupid
I'm the one that held you down when you was losing
Now you got me feeling like shooting Cupid
'Cause you did me wrong

[Pre-Hook]
So when you come running back from the past you'll be out of time
Because I'm done with your ass, you know that you is out of line
And if you ever move on to another one that you find
I hope you fall and you break your heart like you broke mine

[Hook]
'Cause baby we're over
A thousand times over
Ain't no do-overs
It was nice to know you
But this love is over
A thousand times over
I hope the next girl you love ends up fucking you over
A thousand times over

[Verse 3]
Can't believe you've done this when you know it's all I wanted
Said I'm done, I'm done
Early in the morning, got me tossing and turning
Thought you was the one, the one
Even though, I been down since long ago
You been wrong, acting like you on the low
I can't figure out what it is but I'm through
With you

[Hook]
'Cause baby we're over
A thousand times over
Ain't no do-overs
It was nice to know you
But this love is over
A thousand times over
I hope the next girl you love ends up fucking you over
A thousand times over

[Verse 1]
What you talkin' 'bout you changed your mind?
Didn't I treat you right?
Find your way to my heart now you putting on like you don't
Want to be around, can't spend much time
Boy you better recognize
Little money in your pocket, now you're tricking
Talking to me like you're winning

[Pre-Hook]
I was there when you needed me the most so I'm in my feelings
I'm ashamed of the way I felt and you know it's killing my pride
Wasting my time, ain't no surprise
You lost one that's for real
I guess you learn and you live

[Hook]
Damn, just when I put you on
And I thought we're getting stronger
Now your heart's far from home
But it's cool, I don't want you no more
You messed up, boy you got that
I'm good, ain't no comebacks
You did this, I'ma run that
I'm good, it's cool, I don't want you no more

[Verse 2]
Ain't no reason I should compromise
I know too much to fall for your lies
What you take me for
I ain't nothing like them other bitches
Even though I've always sacrificed
I don't mind moving on this time
'Cause time is money and my interest
Ain't on you so that's the difference

[Pre-Hook]
I was there when you needed me the most so I'm in my feelings
I'm ashamed of the way I felt and you know it's killing my pride
Wasting my time, ain't no surprise
You lost one that's for real
I guess you learn and you live

[Hook]
Damn, just when I put you on
And I thought we're getting stronger
Now your heart's far from home
But it's cool, I don't want you no more
You messed up, boy you got that
I'm good, ain't no comebacks
You did this, I'ma run that
I'm good, it's cool, I don't want you no more

[Verse 3]
You ain't thinking straight
You a fool, boy you lost one
Sing my love for you
You know what to do
I been all up in your face
Still can't see I'm the right one
That's too bad for you
Hurts but that's the truth
I mean

[Hook]
Damn, just when I put you on
And I thought we're getting stronger
Now your heart's far from home
But it's cool, I don't want you no more
You messed up, boy you got that
I'm good, ain't no comebacks
You did this, I'ma run that
I'm good, it's cool, I don't want you no more

[Hook]
Damn, just when I put you on
And I thought we're getting stronger
Now your heart's far from home
But it's cool, I don't want you no more
You messed up, boy you got that
I'm good, ain't no comebacks
You did this, I'ma run that
I'm good, it's cool, I don't want you no more

Mustard on the beat, ho!

[Verse 1]
Since the day that I was born
I been looking out for love
But never really quite found the one
They say practice makes perfect
I know I deserve it
Sometimes we should do it for fun

[Pre-Chorus]
Baby wind the clock up, I can't wait
Promise this time won't go to waste
For all we put up now
I won't let your love down
I know we're not too far away
Aye aye

[Chorus]
Why you always take so long to call me?
Know I gotta wake up in the mornin'
You know every second adds up to a minute
Need 10,000 hours
We can be so in love
Don't stop, I'm counting them up
Run the clock, I be counting them up
We can be so in love
You know every second adds up to a minute
Need 10,000 hours
We can be so in love

[Verse 2]
I've been right and I've been wrong
I've been high and I've been low
But this time I know it's for sure
'Cause I'm right where I belong
And we are only getting stronger
Feels good to be down in my soul

[Pre-Chorus]
Baby wind the clock up, I can't wait
Promise this time won't go to waste
For all we put up now
I won't let your love down
I know we're not too far away
Aye aye

[Chorus]
Why you always take so long to call me?
Know I gotta wake up in the mornin'
You know every second adds up to a minute
Need 10,000 hours
We can be so in love
Don't stop, I'm counting them up
Run the clock, I be counting them up
We can be so in love
You know every second adds up to a minute
Need 10,000 hours

[Bridge]
There's no time for us holding out
'Cause this love is profound
Let the clock go around
Let the clock go around
Love is best when built from the ground
To your heart I am bound
Let the clock go around
Let the clock go around

[Chorus]
Why you always take so long to call me?
Know I gotta wake up in the mornin'
You know every second adds up to a minute
Need 10,000 hours
We can be so in love
Don't stop, I'm counting them up
Run the clock, I be counting them up
We can be so in love
You know every second adds up to a minute
Need 10,000 hours

[Verse 1: Ella Mai & Chris Brown]

You know that I got a man (ooh yeah, shit)
We could wait until we're single (Damn)
But it won't be as fun then (Ooh, no, shit, baby)

[Pre-Chorus: Ella Mai, Chris Brown]

And let some bullshit creep in
You might make me say, "Fuck him"

[Outro: Ella Mai, Chris Brown & Both]

You notice my perfume and tell me I'm perfect
Oh, you're so deserving
Baby, you're worth it

Honestly ain't tryna push
I just know where to look
See you watching me watching you watch my body
Don't be scared to speak up

[Pre-Chorus]
So deep in lust that we just might drown
Don't do it
Help me believe that it's love we found, stick to it
What's in the air got me up right now, zooming
I'm tryna show you but don't know how

[Chorus]
If you show me you're down maybe I'll stick around
This could be something that's special for us
If you show me you're down maybe I'll stick around
This could be something that's special for us
'Cause this could be forever after
I just want you to myself
Tryna be the one that matter

If you show me you're down maybe I'll stick around

[Verse 2]
Wanna know if you're sure

Don't really know what you do to me
But take that next step boy it's cool with me
Cool with me

[Pre-Chorus]

[Outro]
Relationship? So now you want to use the 'R' word. Well if that's the case then, come meet me for lunch tomorrow. One o'clock

[Verse 1: Ella Mai]
Something in the walls
Something in your walk looks different
Something deep inside
Got me wondering why I don't understand
Why I can't put my finger on what the fuck is up
What's missing?
You're distant, and I'm spinnin'

[Pre-Chorus: Ella Mai]
Don't ask questions usually
Got the answers that I need
Intuition tellin' me
Mmm

[Chorus: Ella Mai]
I just have a gut feeling
Don't know why I don't know what it was, really
But the more we touch, the more it starts killin' me
Killin' me
Just have a gut feeling
Killin' me

[Verse 2: H.E.R.]
Uh, lookin' in your eyes
I've been feelin' like I'm crazy
'Cause I'm goin' through your phone, look for somethin' wrong
I can't find nothin'
I must be trippin' tryna listen to my intuition
Sayin' you're guilty
So baby, just tell me
I never asked before but right now I don't know what's goin' on

[Pre-Chorus: Ella Mai & H.E.R.]
Don't ask questions usually
Got the answers that I need
Intuition tellin' me
Mmm

[Chorus: Ella Mai & H.E.R.]
I just have a gut feeling
Don't know why I don't know what it was, really
But the more we touch, the more it starts killin' me
Killin' me
Just have a gut feeling
Killin' me

[Bridge: Ella Mai]
I'm the first to speak my mind up if I feel a way
Not the type to be here cryin' in my pillowcase
Is it nothin'? Or somethin'?
Ooh, yeah

[Chorus: Ella Mai & H.E.R.]
I just have a gut feeling
Don't know why I don't know what it was, really
But the more we touch, the more it starts killin' me
Killin' me
Just have a gut feeling
Killin' me
Killin', killin' me

[Post-Chorus: Ella Mai & H.E.R.]
Starts killing

Starts killing
(Ah, ah, ah)
Oh, woah
(Ah, ah, ah)
Killing me
(Ah, ah, ah)
(Ah, ah, ah), yeah
(Ah, ah, ah)
Killin', (Ah, ah, ah)

[Outro: Ella Mai]
A: Aware. I was guarded while my guardian angel never parted ways. Just stayed and layed with me. Not nakedly, just waited patiently. For now, I am aware. And as I stare into your soul, I see it clear. Can we start again from here?

[Verse 1]
We ain't even been talkin' for a minute yet (Minute yet)
And I already got you elevated
You don't know if I'm a saint or a sinner yet (Sinner yet)
But you already singin' Ella praises
If we're out for the night and you're by my side
Don't get emotional
'Cause niggas gon' slide wit' you in my ride
So I rather let you know

[Pre-Chorus]
Even though I'm good without you
I'm fuckin' with you regardless (Regardless)
And if that's gon' hurt you
Least you can say is I'm honest (Honest)
Good things don't always get to you the way that you want it (Want it)
I'm good without you but I'm fuckin' with you regardless (Regardless)

[Chorus]
So tell me if it gets too much
Tell me if you bit too much
Boy, act right 'cause it's cool if
There's too much sauce in the food for you
Sorry that you can't keep up
You're lookin' like you bit too much
Boy, act right 'cause it's cool
It's just too much sauce in the food for you

[Post-Chorus]
Too much sauce
I got too much sauce, sauce

[Verse 2]
Don't I still pull up when you need it?
I gotta know you can deal with it (Stop)
Readin' through the lines, boy, you're showin' (Stop)
Playin' with your mind, 'bout to blow it
It takes a strong man, strong shoulders
You gotta level up if you want this (Stop)
Chewin' with you mouth wide open
Like you can't see

[Pre-Chorus]
Even though I'm good without you
I'm fuckin' with you regardless (Regardless)
And if that's gon' hurt you
Least you can say is I'm honest (Honest)
Good things don't always get to you the way that you want it (Want it)
I'm good without you but I'm fuckin' with you regardless (Regardless)

[Chorus]
So tell me if it gets too much
Tell me if you bit too much
Boy, act right 'cause it's cool if
There's too much sauce in the food for you (Too much)
Sorry that you can't keep up
You're looking like you bit too much
Boy, act right 'cause it's cool
It's just too much sauce in the food for you

[Bridge]
Too much sauce
Know what to do with it, you know what to do with it
I got too much sauce
Know what to do with it, you know what to do with it
Can't hang, can't hang with a boss
Know what to do with it, you know what to do with it
I got too much sauce
Know what to do with it, you know what to do with it
Too much sauce
(Right, right, right, yeah, right, damn right)
I got too much sauce
(Right, right, right, yeah, right, damn right)
Can't hang, can't hang with a boss
(Right, right, right, yeah, right, damn right)
I got too much sauce
(Right, right, right, yeah, right, damn right)

[Outro: Spoken]
L: Lust
Four letters like love, but less precious
More like electric veins running fast than frenzy my heart
Make me crave and act restless
So infectious

[Verse 1]
I don't know who's living in my body
'Cause I don't recognize a thing about it
That don't even matter, I'm just glad I got into the party
So I can feel your music in my body
'Cause you the only out of everybody
Who can deal with all my ways
I know I got some ways
But you control the flame
So I just wanna stay right here with you

[Pre-Chorus]
It could be a room full of people, you still my sight
Look at how the whole world is searchin', but I got mine
It's emotional, uncontrollable, all I think about is you
So if the tears wanna flood my gates

[Chorus]
Let the water flow
Just let it fall out from my face
'Cause I never thought I'd ever hear me say
I just can't breathe without my baby
Ooh, you my baby
So come and kiss up on me
As we dance close
Come and kiss up on me slow
As we dance close

[Verse 2]
I don't even really care who knows it
Just keep me there, keep me in the moment
Seen a lot of things, but I never seen my spirit glowin'
The way you do me got me outta body
'Cause you the only out of everybody
Who gon' go out of the way to show me all the ways
Come control the flame
I just wanna stay right here with you

[Pre-Chorus]
It could be a room full of people, you still my sight
Look at how the whole world is searchin', but I got mine
It's emotional, uncontrollable, all I think about is you
So if the tears wanna flood my gates

[Chorus]
Let the water flow
Just let it fall out, out from my face
I never thought I'd ever hear me say
I just can't breathe without my baby
Ooh, come here, baby
So you can kiss up on me
As we dance close
Come and kiss up on me slow
As we dance close
So you can kiss up on me
As we dance close
Come and kiss up on me slow
As we dance

Just let it fall out, out from my face
I never thought I'd ever hear me say
I just can't breathe without my baby
Ooh, come here, baby
So you can kiss up on me
As we dance close
Come and kiss up on me slow
As we dance close
As we dance close
Come and kiss up on me slow
As we dance close

[Outro]
I: Inner. I bring to you through words I sing. My flaws, my dreams, and all from within. I am Ella Mai

[Intro]
Ella Mai: I been thinking 'bout telling him for a while now but what you think?
Girl: I think that's a good idea, are you sure you want to do that?
Ella Mai: I mean, to be honest, I don't even- I don't care. I don't care about him
Girl: That's true, but it's whatever makes you happy
Ella Mai: Hold on, hold on, hold on, he's calling me. I'ma call you back, alright?
Girl: Alright

Ella Mai: Hello?
Guy: Hey, what's up? I just want to say I'm sorry

[Verse]
Hold up
I got a confession
While you was out doing her, I was out doing him
Had to teach you a lesson
'Cause what I needed here was missing
Two can play the game, I ain't tripping
'Cause you thought that I would stay
Now your ass gon' pay
Can't teach an old dog new tricks
Ain't gon' be the one you screwing
You made your bed, boy you better lay in it
'Cause I'm laying with another
Hope the next time you know better
Next time you know better
Next time you know better
Next time you know better

[Intro]
I tried to move on
Forget you were so much
Look what you've done
Shame you've all screwed up
I tried to move on
Forget you were so much
Look what you've done
Shame you've all screwed up

[Verse 1]
Couldn't be more overdue
All the rumors seem to be so true
How could you ever
Look me right in the eye
And tell me all of your goddamn lies
Turn to despise

[Pre-Hook]
Fuck you, can't be involved in all of this bull
Best believe I'm through
With you, with you, with you
Fuck you, it's funny how you're sorry
'Cause boy, well me too
And no matter what you do
It's done now, it's done now

[Hook]
Boy time's up
You never thought the day would come, huh?
Hey, don't cry now
Should've been there when
I told you stop with the games
But you gon' learn one day

[Verse 2]
Wonder if you know the deal
You'll never meet another girl so real
You don't know what you
Got until it's gone
Plenty will tell you I'm the one
You'll never find another
You'll never do another

[Pre-Hook]
Fuck you, can't be involved in all of this bull
Best believe I'm through
With you, with you, with you
Fuck you, it's funny how you're sorry
'Cause boy, well me too
And no matter what you do
It's done now, it's done now

[Hook]
Boy time's up
You never thought the day would come, huh?
Hey, don't cry now
Should've been there when
I told you stop with the games
But you gon' learn one day

[Verse 3]
Oh now you can do what you want, boy
No more answering to others
You can do what you want to
I know I'll be good, yeah
It's my time now
This love died out

[Hook]
Boy time's up
You never thought the day would come, huh?
Hey, don't cry now
Should've been there when
I told you stop with the games
But you gon' learn one day

[Outro]
Don't say sorry now, I mean
Don't even waste your time

[Verse 1]
Mama said never love a nigga more than he love me
See my daddy said the same thing, and he an OG
Your love is all I can think of
I don't want it, boy I need it now
My heart is telling me I'm crazy
'Cause I shouldn't be sticking around

[Prehook]
Everybody know in the town
I'm the one that's holding you down
You the one that's hoeing around
Everybody know, everybody know in the town
But I'm the one that's still here now
Still here
Still loving my baby like he ain't did nothin'
But that's still my baby, yeah he still the one

[Hook]
Oh baby, I'm the definition of a rider
That's my baby
I ain't gon' leave 'cause I ain't a switch sider
No I ain't, no I won't
You make me want to leave you every day, but I don't
I'm still riding
'Cause I ain't a switch sider
No, no I ain't a switch sider
No, no I ain't a switch sider

[Verse 2]
Mama said never love a nigga more than he love me
See my daddy said the same thing, and he an OG
We on a love rollercoaster
But I can't help myself, I need it now, now
Does this have something to do with her?
Is she the reason that you're not around?

[Prehook]
Everybody know in the town
I'm the one that's holding you down
You the one that's hoeing around
Everybody know, everybody know in the town
But I'm the one that's still here now
Still here
Still loving my baby like he ain't did nothin'
But that's still my baby, yeah he still the one

[Hook]
Oh baby, I'm the definition of a rider
That's my baby
I ain't gon' leave 'cause I ain't a switch sider
No I ain't, no I won't
You make me want to leave you every day, but I don't
I'm still riding
'Cause I ain't a switch sider
No, no I ain't a switch sider
No, no I ain't a switch sider

[Bridge]
Mama said never love a nigga more than he love me
See my daddy said the same thing, and he an OG

[Hook]
Oh baby, I'm the definition of a rider
That's my baby
I ain't gon' leave 'cause I ain't a switch sider
No I ain't, no I won't
You make me want to leave you every day, but I don't
I'm still riding
'Cause I ain't a switch sider
No, no I ain't a switch sider
No, no I ain't a switch sider

[Outro]
It's like, every time I try and confess my love for you
It's just... Hello?
See this is what I'm talking about
You never ever listen to what I'm saying
I know you went out last night
And I know there's someone else
I might as well just...
My friends warned me about you, I mean
I should've listened

[Verse 1]
So what if I wake up with a attitude?
You assumin' that I must be mad at you
Didn't get no sleep with you last night
Know it hurts when I swerve, but I had to
So what if I wake up with a attitude?
You assumin' that I must be mad at you
I just rolled out of bed on the wrong side, and...
Now we in a bad mood

[Pre-Chorus]
You don't wanna deal with it, deal with it
You gotta be real with it, real with it
You wanna leave, but you're just in your feels
That's why you're still in it, still in it
You don't wanna deal with it, deal with it
You gotta be real with it, real with it
You wanna leave but you're just in your feels
That's why I'm still winnin'

[Chorus]
With that good bad behavior
(Good, good, good, good, bad)
Good, bad
(Good, good, good, good, bad)
I'm good bad for you, I'm good bad for you
Oh, oh, that good bad behavior, uh
(Good, good, good, good, bad)
(Good, good, good, good, bad)
Who doesn't love it good bad?
Oh, you want me good bad?

[Post-Chorus]
Least I know I got your attention
Notice how you can't help but mention, ah
Oh, at least I know I got your attention
Got you with that good bad
Oh, baby, ain't no goin' back

[Verse 2]
So what if I wake up with a attitude?
You assumin' that I must be mad at you
I just spent about a day doin' my hair
Still ain't fuckin' with it, I ain't goin' nowhere
So what if I wake up with a attitude?
You assumin' that I must be mad at you
Could've said somethin' when I walked past you
'Stead of, you still in a bad mood, knowin'...

[Pre-Chorus]
I don't wanna deal with it, deal with it
You gotta be real with it, real with it
You wanna leave but you're just in your feels
That's why you're still in it, still in it
You don't wanna deal with it, deal with it
You gotta be real with it, real with it
You wanna leave but you're just in your feels
That's why I'm still winnin'

[Chorus]
With that good bad behavior
(Good, good, good, good, bad)
Good, bad
(Good, good, good, good, bad)
I'm good bad for you, I'm good bad for you
Oh, oh, that good bad behavior, uh

(Good, good, good, good, bad)
Who doesn't love it good bad?
Oh, you want me good bad?

[Post-Chorus]
Least I know I got your attention
Notice how you can't help but mention, ah
Oh, at least I know I got your attention
Got you with that good bad
Oh, baby, ain't no goin' back
(Good, good, good, good, bad)

[Verse 3]
I could go ahead and be good for you
But I know it's the bad that be calling you
Ain't tryna pick a fight, I know wrong from right
It doesn't really matter at the end of the night 'cause
I still go ahead and get bad for you
And I know it's too good for you to walk out the door
So yeah, I may wake up and I'm mad at you
But, baby boy, I know you like a little attitude

[Outro]
With that good bad behavior
(Good, good, good, good, bad)
Good, bad
(Good, good, good, good, bad)
I'm good bad for you, I'm good bad for you (hey)
Oh, oh, that good bad behavior, uh
(Good, good, good, good, bad)
(Good, good, good, good, bad)
Who doesn't love it good bad? (Who don't?)
Oh, you want me good bad? (Good bad)

[Outro]
Good, good, good, good, bad
Good, good, good, good, bad
Good, good, good, good, bad
Good, good, good, good, bad

[Verse 1]
I'm like a gun with no bullets
You could touch me, squeeze me, won't bust if you pull it
Take my number, you can have it
You could call me, text me, I'll look past it

[Pre-Chorus]
If you don't know how to treat a woman
Close your eyes, ain't no point in looking
Over here with the weak shit
Get out of here with the weak shit
You won't get nowhere with that
I had your type before, no I don't want that back
Don't want that back
You talk fiction, I talk facts
Boy if you think I'ma fall more than once for that
You must be crazy, must be out of your mind, out of your mind
You must be drunk, you gotta be real high, real high
If you think I believe a word you say, word you say
You lookin' dumb, headed the wrong way, on a one way, baby

[Chorus]
Only my way, my way, my way goes
Only my way, my way, my way goes
Only my way, my way, my way goes
Only my way, my way, my way goes

[Verse 2]
I'm like a blunt with no lighter
If we break up, don't roll up, 'cause we lost the fire
Once we lose it I can't fake it
If you need my love to live you probably won't make it

[Pre-Chorus]
If you don't know how to treat a woman
Close your eyes, ain't no point in looking
Over here with the weak shit
Get out of here with the weak shit
You won't get nowhere with that
I had your type before, no I don't want that back
Don't want that back
You talk fiction, I talk facts
Boy if you think I'ma fall more than once for that
You must be crazy, must be out of your mind, out of your mind
You must be drunk, you gotta be real high, real high
If you think I believe a word you say, word you say
You lookin' dumb, headed the wrong way, on a one way, baby

[Chorus]
Only my way, my way, my way goes
Only my way, my way, my way goes
Only my way, my way, my way goes
Only my way, my way, my way goes

[Outro]
As much as I try not to look back, I
I do sometimes wonder where we should've been
Where we could've been

[Verse 1]
You've been out here tryna work on me for a minute
Fall in love for a minute
You've been tryna see me through the problems
But everything you're sayin' is the problem
You keep tryna make me slow down for a minute
When I just wanna drown for a minute
You can take advantage
But you're taking chances

[Pre-Chorus]
And I'm so glad you took it
So glad you took it
Cheap shot, caught me when I wasn't looking for you
Shots in the dark, got me following your heart
Cheap shot, got me taking cheap shots
Why are you taking cheap shots?

[Chorus]
Drinking, smoking, doses, potions
Got me doing things I ain't do
Got me doing things I ain't do, true
Drinking, smoking, doses, emotions
Somethin' 'bout the pain mixed with you
Got me doing things, I ain't doing right

[Verse 2]
I've been overthinking
Tryna make the wrong one right for no reason
I was cold for a minute
Blind to the feeling, but you did it, now we're in it

[Pre-Chorus]
And I'm so glad you took it (So glad)
So glad you took it (Cheap shots)
Cheap shot, caught me when I wasn't looking for you
Shots in the dark (Shots in the dark)
Got me following your heart (Following your heart, yeah)
Cheap shot, got me taking cheap shots (So cheap, yeah)
Why are you taking cheap shots?

[Chorus]
Drinking, smoking, doses, potions
You know you got me doing things I ain't do
You know you got me doing things I ain't do, true
Drinking, smoking, doses, emotions
Somethin' 'bout the pain mixed with you
Got me doing things, I ain't doing right, true

[Post-Chorus]
And it ain't really what it seems
But what it seems is what it looks like (True)
And you can never call me yours
But can call me when you feel like it
Drinking, smoking, doses, no emotions
Somethin' 'bout the pain mixed with you
Got me doing things, I ain't doing right

[Verse 3]
It's so hard to admit all the changes
Stuck in the same system for ages
I'm just tryna take a hold of what's left of me
It can't get the best of me
It's amazing what little lies can do
They're just pieces, but they devour you
I'm a monster just tryna vibe with you
So come over if you want but you can never call me yours when we're

[Chorus]
Drinking, smoking, doses, potions
Somethin' 'bout the pain mixed with you
You know you got me doing things I ain't do
You know you got me doing things I ain't do, true
Drinking, smoking, doses, emotions
Somethin' 'bout the pain mixed with you
Got me doing things, I ain't doing right, true

[Post-Chorus]
And it ain't really what it seems
But what it seems is what it looks like (True)
And you can never call me yours
But can call me when you feel like it
Drinking, smoking, doses, no emotions
Somethin' 'bout the pain mixed with you
Got me doing things, I ain't doing right (True)

[Outro]
True, got me doing things, I ain't doing right (True)
True, got me doing things, I ain't doing right (True)
Got me doing things, I ain't doing right

Know when your body talk about how your body need my body
Won't be no games when you get home

M: Mystery
To be honest I thought you knew. Maybe I lied. Maybe I wanna come through. Who am I? Oh, you'll find out soon. Maybe zones don't apply. Maybe "friends" is old news

[Verse 1]
Couldn't sleep last night
Waking up in cold sweats, reading your last line
Now it's six in the morning
And I'm staring at the side of the bed that you're not in
I wonder where you're waking
Wonder if you're all alone
Don't you wish you could just be right here
Waking up where you belong

[Pre-Chorus]
Why you playin' hard to get?
Never had to wait this long before
Never been the type to fight for more
Waking up with no regrets
Isn't that what we do this for?
Isn't that what we do this for?

[Chorus]
So let me take you to my room, I'll give you what you need
I just want to take you home with me
I just want to take this to another level
Get you high off my intensity
I just want to take you home with me
I just want to give you that breakfast in bed
You home with me
I just want to give you that breakfast in bed
You home with me
I just want to give you that breakfast in bed
You home with me
I just want to give you that breakfast in bed
Take you home with me
I just want to get you home with me (breakfast in bed)
I just want to give you that, I just want to give you that

[Verse 2]
Why you makin' me beg?
You ain't gotta do me like that, boy it ain't fair
I been trying my hardest
Last week you was on it and you wouldn't stop calling
I know what you're thinking
Don't want to make it serious
But we don't need a title for what we got here
And the rest is up to us

[Pre-Chorus]
Why you playin' hard to get?
Never had to wait this long before
Never been the type to fight for more
Waking up with no regrets
Isn't that what we do this for?
Isn't that what we do this for?

[Chorus]
So let me take you to my room, I'll give you what you need
I just want to take you home with me
I just want to take this to another level
Get you high off my intensity
I just want to take you home with me
I just want to give you that breakfast in bed
You home with me
I just want to give you that breakfast in bed
You home with me
I just want to give you that breakfast in bed
You home with me
I just want to give you that breakfast in bed
Take you home with me
I just want to get you home with me (breakfast in bed)
I just want to give you that, I just want to give you that

[Verse 3]
On a silver platter when you wake up
High into my realm I wanna take ya
Got a lot of tricks, let me break you off
You know what time it is when I take it off
Boy you know I got a lot to offer, I ain't never gonna stop you when you wanna come get it
Just know I keep it real tight so you can stay for the night wake up, breakfast in bed

[Chorus]
So let me take you to my room, I'll give you what you need
I just want to take you home with me
I just want to take this to another level
Get you high off my intensity
I just want to take you home with me
I just want to give you that breakfast in bed

[Outro]
I don't want to sound crazy but
I just wanted to make sure we were on the same page
If it's me it's, it's only me
You and me

[Intro]
Mustard on the beat, ho!

Roll with it all you gotta do is roll with it
Let me into your system baby yeah, roll with it

You ain't gotta go get it when I pull up with that work for you baby come get it

[Pre-Chorus]
You been on my mind ever since
Need to relax sit back and let it sink
Stimulate our minds away in every kind of way
And blow the stress away ain't gotta think

[Chorus]
Let's take a trip up to the island and just lay up
A private flight up for the night gon' take us way up

Just the two of us no one else invited

But go slow with it get a hold in it
Don't you let me take control in it
Take control in it

Stimulate our minds away in every kind of way

Take a min out the game you the player
Unravel me boy all these layers
And we go at it again an hour later

[Chorus]
Let's take a trip up to the island and just lay up, lay up

[Outro]
Just when I thought I couldn't love again, you changed me

[Chorus]
We go back
We go forth
We go round and round
You be there
I be here
So I don't know how
Who knew?
That you ever will break through
Who knew?
Who knew?

[Verse 1]
'Bout time for some real shit
Need to tell you how I'm feeling
Since you talking to the realest
I'm just trying to really stack millions
Like to do it
A little lovin' won't kill it
Been awhile
That I've been by myself
But oh now
Could be something to invest in
The dots connecting

[Chorus]
We go back
We go forth
We go round and round
You be there
I be here
So I don't know how
Who knew?
That you ever will break through
Who knew?
Who knew?

[Post-Chorus]
I'm just trying to figure how you doing what you doing
How you turning to the only one that I'm pursuing
All I'm trying to say is
Who knew?
That you ever will break through
Who knew?
Who knew?

[Verse 2]
Got me feeling like I'm spinning
'Cause you're so appealing
We ain't gotta conceal this
Damn you got me all up on the ceiling
We can seal it
Tell me where you wanna steer it
'Cause I'm down
And if you wanna be
Around
Baby keep it in the moment
Ain't no telling where we going

[Chorus]
We go back
We go forth
We go round and round
You be there
I be here
So I don't know how
Who knew?
That you ever will barge through
Who knew?
Who knew?

[Post-Chorus]
I'm just trying to figure how you doing what you doing
How you turning to the only one that I'm pursuing
All I'm trying to say is
Who knew?
That you ever will break through
Who knew?
Who knew?

[Bridge]
I'm just not sure of how you got me all in love
Boy you got my attention, don't you?
It don't matter
'Cause with you I feel better
Crazy how you just barge right in
Yeah (don't break my heart)

[Post-Chorus]
I'm just trying to figure how you doing what you doing
How you turning to the only one that I'm pursuing
All I'm trying to say is
Who knew?
That you ever will break through
Who knew?
Who knew?

I'm just trying to figure how you doing what you doing
How you turning to the only one that I'm pursuing
All I'm trying to say is
Who knew?
That you ever will break through
Who knew?
Who knew?

[Outro]
I know I probably don't tell you enough, but, I really really care about you
And I just want you to know, you got me one hundred

[Verse 1]
Baby
I been thinkin' 'bout you all the time
Lately
I been wantin' you back in my life
I know, I know
Been a while since we felt the vibe
But I know I know, I know I know
I know what you like

[Pre-Chorus]
Met you in the lobby, I was just arriving, you was checking out
Felt you staring at me and immediately I had no doubt
Missed your flight, we spent the week together but it's all over now
'Cause we tried to keep it going when we got home but our heads were in the clouds

[Chorus]
So I'm waiting for the sun to come up
Take me for a ride in your Beamer
Let's just roll the top down, ain't gon' stop
'Til the stars are above
Wish that you would talk to me
'Cause I don't really know just what to think
Got me now, runnin' round, looking for your love
Kinda makes me wonder
Why you playin' with me?
Kinda makes me wonder
Do you think of me?
Kinda makes me wonder

[Verse 2]
It's raining
Thought we'd never drift but I can't lie
We faded
Grass ain't always greener on the other side
I know, I know
I know that the cold world passes by
But I know I know, I know I know
I know what you like

[Pre-Chorus]
Met you in the lobby, I was just arriving, you was checking out
Felt you staring at me and immediately I had no doubt
Missed your flight, we spent the week together but it's all over now
'Cause we tried to keep it going when we got home but our heads were in the clouds

[Chorus]
So I'm waiting for the sun to come up
Take me for a ride in your Beamer
Let's just roll the top down, ain't gon' stop
'Til the stars are above
Wish that you would talk to me
'Cause I don't really know just what to think
Got me now, runnin' round, looking for your love
Kinda makes me wonder
Why you playin' with me?
Kinda makes me wonder
Do you think of me?
Kinda makes me wonder
Why you playin' with me?
Kinda makes me wonder
Do you think of me?
It kinda makes me wonder

[Chorus]
So I'm waiting for the sun to come up
Take me for a ride in your Beamer
Let's just roll the top down, ain't gon' stop
'Til the stars are above
Wish that you would talk to me
'Cause I don't really know just what to think
Got me now, runnin' round, looking for your love
Kinda makes me wonder
Why you playin' with me?
Kinda makes me wonder
Do you think of me?
Kinda makes me wonder

[Outro]
I feel like I'm driving myself crazy continuously wondering about you
I have to remember that I come first
Ultimately this is my world and
I'm ready

[Verse 1]
I ain't looking for a cheap thrill
If I love I want to love real
Give me something I can feel
Po' me up, I drink it down and get a refill
I don't just give trust, baby you and I-I-I-I
Something ignites us, like fire-ire-ire

[Pre-Hook]
I don't want your money I just want your appeal
Kick back, Netflix and chill
All I ask is that you keep your end of the deal
Boy we got mad time to kill
Take your time
There's no rush, we alright
I ain't goin' nowhere baby
Don't you worry, we can do this all night
Put your hands up on my body
It's a party, you know how to play nice

[Hook]
My body, your body, might just let this get naughty
Boy it's your private party, and we just getting started
My body, your body, might just let this get naughty
Boy it's your private party, and we just getting started

[Verse 2]
Do the right thing, keep scoring
Your team I'm promoting
We ain't gotta take the fast lane
Slow-mo-mo, woah where you goin'?
Pace yourself with this love
And I'ma make sure that you always have enough
My heart on cuff
And I ain't got no plans giving you up

[Pre-Hook]
It ain't about your money I just want your appeal
Kick back, Netflix and chill
All I ask is that you keep your end of the deal
Boy we got mad time to kill

There's no rush, we alright
I ain't goin' nowhere baby
Don't you worry, we can do this all night
Put your hands up on my body

[Hook]
My body, your body, might just let this get naughty
Boy it's your private party, and we just getting started

Boy it's your private party, and we just getting started

[Bridge]
It's 'bout time for a little loving
Don't be shy, come here baby, don't you want to touch it?
Hands up on my body, ain't no need for rushing
Ain't no limit where we're going, I want all or nothing
It's 'bout time for a little loving
Don't be shy, come here baby, don't you want to touch it?
Hands up on my body, ain't no need for rushing

Boy it's your private party, and we just getting started
My body, your body, might just let this get naughty
Boy it's your private party, and we just getting started

[Verse 1]
Got that exclusive for you
Ain't nothing conclusive 'round here
'Cause you know I got you right where you need to be
Boy let me put it on you
It don't get no better, I promise
Let's cherish this moment
You have been chosen, fuck what she wanted

[Chorus]
You ain't allowed
To fuck with nobody else
You ain't allowed
To fuck with nobody else
'Cause what we got right here
Ain't nobody gonna understand, no no
But you still ain't allowed
To fuck with nobody else

[Verse 2]
Always loyal from the instant that you walked my way
Always down for whatever, I got you baby
I got you fiending for me
It's really appealing to me
So that I reveal and flaunt it
'Cause you ain't allowed

[Chorus]
You ain't allowed
To fuck with nobody else
You ain't allowed
To fuck with nobody else
'Cause what we got right here
Ain't nobody gonna understand, no no
But you still ain't allowed
To fuck with nobody else

[Outro]
Are you even listening?
I don't know about you but I really don't have time to waste
It's simple
It's my way or no way

[Intro]
Mustard on that beat, ho!

[Verse 1]
Your kind of love should have a warning
Didn't know I would fall like this
Each and every morning can't wait to kiss your lips, nah

[Pre-Chorus]
I ain't looking for another one
No need you got everything I want
Just keep giving me love
Giving me love
Giving me love

[Chorus]
In the madness of this world
I'm glad I found you
When my heart don't seem to work
It's you I turn to
It get hard it get hard out there
Put your arms put your arms right here, oh
You don't have to say a word
I'm glad I found you
I'm glad I found you
I'm glad I found

[Verse 2]
Something I can build on
Your rock in the sea of sand
Even when the sun gone
You bring the light of your love to my land, oh

[Pre-Chorus]
I ain't looking for another one
No need you got everything I want
Just keep giving me love
Giving me love
Giving me love

[Chorus]
In the madness of this world

[Bridge]
Someone with the effort
Someone with the time

Good amongst the evil
Simba in his prime
Ooh I'm in my equal
I'm glad I found you, yeah yeah
I'm glad I found you, yeah yeah
I'm glad I found

[Chorus]
In the madness of this world

[Verse 1]
Ooh, tell me what I could do
This ain't what it's supposed to be
I don't wanna drop it now
But you ain't up under me
And tell me what I could say
To make it feel right with you
'Cause you got a lot of love
And I got some things to do, and I'm...
I'm just a woman in love
Never thought it could feel like this
All I need is a late night call
Got me running right back, back, back, back
I don't wanna get over you
I just wanna, offer it now

[Pre-Chorus]
All day (All day)
All night (And all night)
You got some nerve playin' with fire
You don't (You don't), realize (No)

[Chorus]
That I'm on my way for your satisfaction (Faction), 'faction
Caught in bad habits, call me an addict
But I need your satisfaction (Ooh-ooh), 'faction
You got that kinda somethin', fuck, it's good
It make me run my mouth
Oh-oh-oh-oh, ooh, run my mouth
Oh-hoo, run my mouth

[Verse 2]
I tried to let you go
I came because I'm too caught up, yeah
It's because you keep calling me
All up all over me
I get stuck inside these walls that you built (Ohh, yeah)

[Pre-Chorus]
All day (All day)
All night (And all night)
You got some nerve playin' with fire
You don't (You don't), realize (You don't realize)

[Verse 1]
I'll fix the strings and play my part
I know the pain that's in your heart
I've tread the distance, near or far
Just wanna be right where you are

[Pre-Chorus]
I know love has been a stranger to you
Maybe I'm the one to change it for you
Won't be easy 'cause the lessons feel new
But the writing's on the wall

[Chorus]
Love is easy, easy
So don't you make it hard
Can't you see me, see me, see me?
Be easy with my heart

[Post-Chorus]
All we got is here and now
Why won't you let your guard down?
I'm just tryna show you how
Love is easy
So don't you make it hard

[Verse 2]
I'll chase the wind, I'll face your dark
I'll make a wish upon your star
Although you're afraid I'll break your heart
Just let my hands erase your scars

[Pre-Chorus]
I know love has been a stranger to you
Maybe I'm the one to change it for you
Won't be easy 'cause the lessons feel knew
But the writing's on the wall

[Chorus]
Love is easy, easy
So don't you make it hard
Can't you see me, see me, see me?
Be easy with my heart

[Bridge]
Oh, take your time, no need for rushing things (Rushing things)
Baby, don't you know that with me, you're safe?
The easy option is to run away (Don't run away)
To hide from love, oh, baby, what would it change?
I been thinking 'bout some better days (Better days, yeah)
Not to pressure, all I'm tryna say is...

[Chorus]
Love is easy, easy (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
So don't you make it hard (Don't you make it, said don't you make it hard)
Can't you see me, see me, see me? (Can't you see me crying)
Be easy with my heart (My heart, my heart, my heart, my heart)

[Post-Chorus]
All we got is here and now (All we got is here and now)
Why won't you let your guard down (Your guard down)
I'm just tryna show you how
Love is easy (So, so easy, yeah)
So don't you make it hard (Hard)

[Verse 1]
Love me like your life depends upon it
Let me know how bad, how bad you want it
Tell me, you can't stay away
Love me with the love that's got no limits
Take it just as good as you can give it
Then give me more than I can take

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't want just your body
I wanna be the only thing on your mind
When you're not around me, want thoughts about me taking up all your time
I want you in so deep, that you can't keep, can't keep your hands off of me

[Chorus]
When I'm gone, say you're back just a little (A little)
Love me in extremes, not the middle
'Till you're so damn gone, you can't go back
Love me, love me, love me, love me like that
Love me like that

[Verse 2]
Say you'd hate your life without me in it
Say you'd hate it more with every minute
Say you can't live without me
Let me know how much you love to hold me
Then find a million different ways to show me
Show me, that I'm all that you need

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't want just your body
I wanna be the only thing on your mind
When you're not around me, want thoughts about me taking up all your time
I want you in so deep, that you can't keep, can't keep your hands off of me

[Chorus]
When I'm gone, say you're back just a little (A little)
Love me in extremes, not the middle
'Till you're so damn gone, you can't go back
Love me, love me, love me, love me like that
Love me like

[Post-Chorus]
You've never loved nothing before
Then love me even more
Wake up with my name on your lips
'Cause you've never had nothing like this (Hey)

[Chorus]
When I'm gone, say you're back just a little (A little)
Love me in extremes, not the middle
'Till you're so damn gone, you can't go back
Love me, love me, love me, love me like that
Love me like that
Love me like that
Love me like that

[Verse 1]
I'm the type to play safe
Always hard to make decisions, but you break me out
I ain't never been taste but
I bet my flavor's kinda different since you came around
I been keeping up the pace
All I'm tryna do is see is what you talkin' 'bout
'Cause I know what to say
I'ma love it either way

[Pre-Chorus]
Mmm, your kiss, your touch
Can't give in enough
My care, for ya
So deep, you know it because
I'll be right here with your breakfast when you wake up
And I love you 'cause you love me with no makeup
Even if there's someone else tryna pursue it
You the only one I'm doin', ooh, boy

[Chorus]
That's dangerous
There's no one else I trust
I put my all in us
I know the risk in love, yeah
That makes this dangerous
I still want all of ya
You got me so wrapped up
What if we're savin' love? That's dangerous

[Post-Chorus]
Somethin' about this feelin' so familiar
It's like I'm lookin' at myself in the mirror
You put the pieces of my heart back together
You got me thinkin' 'bout forever and ever
Dangerous
What if we're savin' love?
Nothing can break it up, no
This could be dangerous

[Verse 2]
You ain't too good 'around the away
I put in work, I love a challenge, I can break the rules
You call me every single day
Yeah, everybody think I'm good but I'll be bad for you
So tell me how you wanna play
If it's you against the world, then you know who I choose
That's never gonna change
That's why I love you either way

[Pre-Chorus]
Mmm, your kiss, your touch
Can't give in enough
My care, for ya
So deep, you know it because
I'll be right here with your breakfast when you wake up
And I love you 'cause you love me with no makeup
Even if there's someone else tryna pursue it
You the only one I'm doin', ooh, boy

[Chorus]
That's dangerous
There's no one else I trust
I put my all in us
I know the risk in love, yeah
That makes this dangerous
I still want all of ya
You got me so wrapped up
What if we're savin' love? That's dangerous

[Post-Chorus]
Somethin' about this feelin' so familiar
It's like I'm lookin' at myself in the mirror
You put the pieces of my heart back together
You got me thinkin' 'bout forever and ever
Dangerous
What if we're savin' love?
Nothing can break it up, no
This could be dangerous

[Bridge]
I'll give my life, put it on the line, is that crazy?
'Cause boys like you don't usually fall for the girls like me
Is it hard to believe?
You changed me, and that's crazy
Mmm, your heart was dark, I brought the sun
Forget the past, what's done is done
Please know that you're the only one
You jump, I jump, it's all for love
I'm like the bullet to your gun
Still feels like we have just begun
Oh, this could be dangerous, oh, yeah

[Chorus]
Dangerous
There's no one else I trust
I put my all in us
(I put my all in us, yeah)
I know the risk in love, yeah
That makes this dangerous (Oh, dangerous)
I still want all of ya (Yeah)
You got me so wrapped up
What if we're savin' love? That's dangerous (That's, that's)

[Post-Chorus]
Somethin' about this feelin' so familiar
It's like I'm lookin' at myself in the mirror
You put the pieces of my heart back together
You got me thinkin' 'bout forever and ever
Dangerous, yeah
What if we're savin' love? (Savin' love)
Nothing can break it up, no
This could be dangerous

[Verse 1]
Everybody says time heals all pain
But time itself caused you to change
Never thought you'd quit
Said you wanted to commit
But you didn't embrace me as your benefit, no
I thought our intellect had us intertwined
You let her lies change your mind
When I look for you it's like I'm blind
But in your absence it's me I find

[Chorus]
I don't understand how you could ever leave me
I did it all for you baby
Can't take back time that you wasted
And you claim that it's you, it's not me
But you left me, you left me, you left me
But I found myself

[Hook]
It was good for me, it was good for me (yea)
Realised I was more than you wanted me to be, baby
It was good for me, it was good for me (yea)
Realised I was more than you wanted me to be

Tried to put me down, put me down, put me down
You tried to put me down
Thinking you were slick
Boy you ain't shit (nah)

Tried to put me down, put me down, put me down
You tried to put me down
Thinking you were slick
Boy you ain't shit

[Verse 2]
Boy quit playing
You already had your chance
You coulda had me number one
I told you in advance
Instead you were messing with those girls around your way
You realised your mistake
You turned but it's too late (late)

[Chorus]
I don't understand how you could ever leave me
I did it all for you baby
Can't take back time that you wasted
And you claim that it's you, it's not me
But you left me, you left me, you left me
But I found myself

[Hook]
It was good for me, it was good for me (yea)
Realised I was more than you wanted me to be, baby
It was good for me, it was good for me (yea)
Realised I was more than you wanted me to be

Tried to put me down, put me down, put me down
You tried to put me down
Thinking you were slick
Boy you ain't shit, nah

Tried to put me down, put me down, put me down
You tried to put me down
Thinking you were slick
Boy you ain't shit

E: Emotion
A natural instinctive state of mind deriving from one's circumstances, mood, or relationships with others
A rollercoaster

[Verse 1]
Fuck this Patron, I'm so damn gone
Really wish it was you that was blowing up my phone
But I, know I can't come home to ya
Know I'm not the one for ya
You tell me take a step back

You're taken I don't like that

Said I hate that this is real, yeah

[Hook]
'Cause I be drunk texting, drunk texting, drunk texting you
And she be texting back like "this ain't ya man, who the fuck are you?"
All up in the morning wishing you just had me moaning
All up in my feelings wishing you were climbing on it
Boy I wish I was with ya
Wish I could kiss ya
But you in love with her
And I ain't in the picture
I wish, I wish, I wish
I wish, I wish, I wish it was me and you

[Verse 2]
You got me out here looking thirsty
And I don't deserve to be in this position
When I first met you, you was feeling me
But you didn't tell me I had competition
So what you doing in the club
Being all up in my ear
You damn sure knew that I was drunk
Lead me on and disappear
I'm still gon' blame it on this liquor
And I'm still gon' hope you pick up

[Pre-hook]
What am I supposed to do when I can't help how I feel
All I know is I want you and I hate that this is real, yeah

Can't stop thinking about what I'm missing
I need you boy, I want you on a mission
Don't shoot me down 'cause on the low you want my attention
Said you want my attention
I keep telling myself that you'll change your mind tomorrow
So I be drinking to rid of all my sorrows
Get lit, take my mind off shit so this pill I will swallow
I gotta let my mind go

[Pre-hook]
What am I supposed to do when I can't help how I feel
All I know is I want you and I hate that this is real, yeah
Said I hate that this is real, yeah

[Hook]
'Cause I be drunk texting, drunk texting, drunk texting you
And she be texting back like "this ain't ya man, who the fuck are you?"

Boy I wish I was with ya
Wish I could kiss ya
But you in love with her
And I ain't in the picture
I wish, I wish, I wish
I wish, I wish, I wish it was me and you

[Verse 1: Ella Mai]
Don't know what it is
Bout the way you lick your lips
There's something about your smile
That so worthwhile
I'm no judge but a murder and a trial
I want you to let your guard down
No playing around,don't make a sound
Can't stop myself from staring
Ready to go? boy I'm wearing
Tryna see whats underneath

[Hook]
What is your destiny
What is it that you need
(I can learn a lot from you)
Tell me your fantasy

Mentally, physically

[Chorus]
Oh baby baby baby baby
Ill put you on a pedestal
Baby baby baby baby
Have you feening for more
Baby baby baby baby
This one night will leave you withdrawn
Baby baby baby baby
Oh baby baby baby baby yea

[Verse 2]
Fifty shades of the unexpected
Behind closed doors feeling so connected
Want no one, nobody else
Do me till my body melts
The passion in these sheets we making heat
Rocking to this steady beat
Not a word till we're complete
Then we press repeat

[Hook]
What is your destiny
What is it that you need
(I can learn a lot from you)
Tell me your fantasy

You're taking me to where I've never been
The side of me nobodies ever seen
Keep touching me right there, right there, right there
Bite my lip while your pulling on my hair

Throw me anywhere
Left, right, up, down making me scream your name out loud
You got it and i want it
Forever and a day
You give me something different
In every way

[Hook]
What is your destiny

[Intro]
Why you frontin' and pretendin' that your something that you ain't
(something that you ain't)
Got me fantasizing, hoping, and dreaming that this was the perfect picture that I painted
I'm here looking for love, but you just wanna fuck
Why you frontin' on me, why you frontin' on me

[Verse 1: Ella Mai]
Sometimes I wonder why I don't do better, cause I know that I know better
I shoulda never settled for ya
Sometimes I think that if I walked out, cut these soul strings, took my own route, you'd reconsider your feelings
Don't know why you lied to me about what you feelings were boy
Now I'm in to deep
I put you first, you put me last
I'm writing this song to keep from crying
Used to feel like you wanted me, so I let you in, but time is running out
Now I'm feeling like you only want me when ya feeling horny or first place ain't picking up

[Chorus]
Why you frontin' standin' in this room pretendin' that your something that you ain't
(Something that you ain't)
Got me fantasizing, hoping, and dreaming that this was the perfect picture that I painted
I'm here looking for love. but you just wanna fuck
Why you frontin' on me, why you frontin' on me

[Verse 2: Ella Mai]
Hold up boy, don't let me down
Ima take this breathe try not you drown myself
I'm not gone smile, you'll see this frown
Is your vision blurred, don't you see my crown
Don't know why I want ya, when I know your just playing games with me
Cause I've observed your here to be served
You got some nerve, you got some nerve
Not really happy that you leaded me on
Used and abused like I'm yo pawn
Don't forget that I put you on
I said don't forget that I put you on

[Chorus]

No I ain't gonna believe ya
Sick of lying and deceiving
Time is wasting, clock is ticking
No, no, no, no, no
Finding what I wasn't supposed to
And them new girls in ya phone book
Ain't got time to take a second look
No, no, no, no, no, no

[Chorus]

[Verse 1] :

We so connected with each other
In love with one another
That we can't stop
You got me feening for your touch
And right before we fuck
You tell me you gone hit that spot

You must've been speeding over here
To get what's under here
You know that shit ain't going anywhere
Na,na,na,na, na
I got you right in front of me
You telling me how much you need
Me,me,me, me

{Pre-Chorus}
Our minds are on another level
So deep you think we had it all
From the outside looking in, they jealous
Cause they can't find what we had
Na,na,na,na

[Chorus]
Just in time, Just in time
You don't need nobody else
Partner in crime, Partner in crime
Love you more than life itself
Bonnie & Clyde, Bonnie & Clyde
Fuck it we saved by the bell
Boy you bout it, bout it
For you I got it, got it

[Verse 2]:
I knew it wasn't too late
Cause baby boy I believe in fate
Let me turn around and put this weight
On ya, ya, ya ya

They say everything happens for a reason
We all know people change like the seasons
(there's something about ya, can't live without ya)
I can't live without you
My girls told me I'm tripping cause I give my all to you
I give my all to you yay
The boys they wanna know me
But, I'll never be untrue, said I'll never be untrue

{Pre-Chorus}
Our minds are on another level
So deep you think we had it all
From the outside looking in, they jealous
Cause they can't find what we had
Na,na,na,na

[Chorus]
Just in time, Just in time
You don't need nobody else
Partner in crime, Partner in crime
Love you more that life itself
Bonnie & Clyde, Bonnie & Clyde
Fuck it we saved by the bell
Boy you bout it, bout it
For you I got it, got it

[Verse 1]
Wake up gotta figure out what's going on
No makeup gotta figure this out on my own
You came and went like the wind (like the wind)
You undressed my soul, you left me skinned

[Verse 2]
Wake up gotta figure out my whereabouts
You fake up gotta figure out for real this time
But how can I see sense
When you left me in such suspense

[Hook]
We're miles apart and we're worlds away
You only came to listen when I came to stay
Give me just one moment for these thoughts

We're miles apart and we're worlds away
You only came to listen when I came to stay
Give me just one moment for these thoughts

[Outro]
(Thoughts)
(Thoughts)
(Thoughts)
(Thoughts)
For these thoughts
For these thoughts
Thoughts
Give me just one moment

[Verse 1: Swae Lee]
Tell 'em again, tell 'em off (Tell 'em off)
It just dawned on me (On me), what's right, feels wrong
No, no wingman, that's only my A-game
At this game, two can play
Kill your vibe, they don't have the right
Baby don't fight it, you're giving me life
Take your time, set the mood right
Settle down, skeptical at first but now I'm not

[Chorus: Swae Lee]
Won't be late, won't delay (Hey)
Won't be late, won't delay (Yeah)

[Verse 2: Drake]
Yeah, yeah, saving my time for you
Suddenly I freed up (Free)
Freezing my times with you
When I'm lonely, I can bring them up
Closed off my line for you (Closing down my line)
I'm better when I'm just on my own, girl
Standing in line for you (Standing in line for you)
Standing here for I don't know how long, girl
Things I wrote (Ayy), lengths I go
Lets you know that I want you
Words we spoke (Yeah), things you wrote
Let me know that you want me too (Yeah)
Ikebe, pressing on me heavy
Pressing up against me real close
Bakasi, moving on me wassy
Time is moving real slow

[Chorus: Swae Lee]
Won't be late, won't delay (Hey)
Won't be late, won't delay (Yeah)
Won't be late, won't delay (Hey)
Won't be late, won't delay (Yeah)

[Chorus]
It shouldn't hurt to look your way (hey, ah-ah, ah)
It shouldn't hurt to look your way (your way, ah-ah, ah)
I shouldn't have to catch a case (ah-ah, ah yeah)
'Cause I'm the one that can't stand to feel any more pain (ah-ah, ooh)

[Verse 1]
I can feel the weight of what you say (ooh, ooh)
I had explanations for days (ooh, ooh)
Don't think you're the only one that's sane
It seems like we're not on the same page
All I do is think when I'm away (when I'm away)
Colors burst and all I see are shapes (hey!)
Sun goes away and that's when I call your name (your name)
She's here for good, and I'm here to stay

[Chorus]
It shouldn't hurt to look your way (hey, ah-ah, ah)
It shouldn't hurt to look your way (your way, ah-ah, ah)
I shouldn't have to catch a case (ah-ah, ah yeah)
'Cause I'm the one that can't stand to feel any more pain (ah-ah, ooh)

[Verse 2]
She said the E was for missin' my embrace (yeah, oh-oh)
So yeah, I feel so out of place (woo, oh yeah)
I was meant to love and protect you
You know what's on my mind, but not what's in my heart
Give me someone to connect to (to)
Because these drinks are hitting me a little hard

[Chorus]
It shouldn't hurt to look your way (hey, ah-ah, ah)
It shouldn't hurt to look your way (your way, ah-ah, ah)
I shouldn't have to catch a case (ah-ah, ah yeah)
'Cause I'm the one that can't stand to feel any more pain (ah-ah, ooh, ooh)

[Outro]
Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ah-ah, ooh, yeah
It shouldn't hurt to look your way
It shouldn't hurt
It shouldn't hurt to look your way
It shouldn't hurt, it shouldn't hurt
Let me fuck with it real quick

[Intro: Young Thug]
Ear Drummers

Got marks all over her knees, ayy

[Pre-Chorus: Swae Lee]
Rollin' off you
Rollin' off you, you overdosin' off my kiss
And the joke is on you
Joke is on you if you fall for that other nigga, hey!

[Chorus: Swae Lee & Young Thug]
I took a trip offshore (Ayy)
Took the whip offshore (Yeah)
I took a chick offshore
You should get out more (Hey, hey)
And you should get out more, you should get out more
Baby, take a lil' tour (Oh)
When we hit that floor, all the money downpour
That's what it's here for (That's what it's for)
Do it up so large, do it up so large, like a breakout star
Bunch of young niggas on a crash course (Do it large, do it large)
Going overboard, going overboard, we can hit that store
Yeah and take it too far (Ayy)

[Verse: Young Thug]
I'ma let you vibe all day (All day)
I don't mind if you try it all day
You know Thugger let you ride all day

And it feels right, my baby, yeah
Baby steps when you walk (Walk)
You got baby steps when you walk
High heels on your feet when you walk (Walk)
High heels on your feet, baby
Lambo, them legs ajar, yeah
And a Maserati truck, the doors in the back ajar
Let's get it on, baby
Make your mouth get it, get it gone, yeah (Gone, yeah)
Like a motorcycle, get it on, baby
Yeah, perform foreplay
So in love, I can buy the bitch a ring every day
Stop this rap shit, turn to a mob any day
Bossman, I could get homie dropped any day
I'll slap the shit out Donald Trump any day
Brand new assistant I like, any day
Better get it right if you don't want gunplay (Gunplay)
I'ma do it right and fill up the driveway (Driveway)
Bentley on the side and it's sittin' on LeBron James (LeBron James)
911 Porsche got me takin' you on a date, ayy (On a date)
Pistol Pete mobbin', I'm bangin' it all day (All day)
Baddest and the baddest and the baddest like all day (All day)
I ran up the millions, I did it all my way (My way)
Hundred dollar bills and I like 'em all straight
Real talk, I'm a neat freak
And lil' mama fold my clothes like a neat freak
You say you doin' somethin', ya uncle reading right through your wrong
Hoes can't talk when I talk where I'm from
32 pumps make 'em run, Forrest, run
Monte Carlo, poppin' my collar
Wrestle that ho like The Mothafuckin' Rock
I say wrestle that ho like The Mothafuckin' Rock
So I let it freeze up
Eat the cake, got amazing cake
These bitches hatin', they throw rice by the case
I'm ridin' down Memory Lane
Catchin' feelings like I'm Walter Payton
I just wanna throw love at this evenin'
Christian Dior with the ski
Bad bitch, yeah, make believe
Barney Balmain on my jeans
Bleedin' like a Tampax Pearl
Mistake, let it rain on your world, ayy
Your diamonds, yeah, they wet like the bottom of the shore, yeah
Better stop playin', say you quick like sand, oh my God

[Chorus: Swae Lee]
I took a trip offshore
Took the whip offshore (Yeah)
I took a chick offshore
You should get out more (Hey, hey)
And you should get out more, you should get out more
Baby, take a lil' tour

[Intro]
EarDrummers
Oh, oh-oh-oh
You won't need me luckily
Oh girl
Mike WiLL Made-It

[Chorus]
You're not taken tonight luckily
Let me save you like a refugee
Let me give you sextasy
Don't let me be ya memory
I've got the drank and a remedy
I know you'd be so intimate with me

[Verse]
Intimate with me couldn't wait
I know you're ready for my embrace
I think you're ready for love's embrace
And you can't please everyone
You're coming out in the dark
But what is it you wish to find?
Just let me ease your mind
They criticized us
Just ease your mind
Is it mine? We'll find out in due time
I've been searchin' near and far
I don't care where my old one ends up
I know you're ready for what's to come
I get enough for both of us
Oh and I hope you stay relevant
Passed like a bird so heavenly
Oh, gave you nights that I can't take back
Oh, and I won't regret and I won't forget
And I won't for- and I can't forget
I was creeping with the restless
You can't pay for the vibe you get
Say that you won't work against me
Time to leave you with the rest of them
Lipstick matchin', magenta
I had a simple agenda
And we connect immediately
And I need more time to give you everything
I need your love on repeat
To rescue me from myself when I fear my heart
Take my soul then lose my number
In a dream, we'll never be apart
I was scarred when I lost my star
But if you cried with somebody, be concerned
Come with me, I can't do you no harm
Fuck with me, bae I mean you no harm
Have you smile, blushin' all the way home

[Intro]
Under my tree this Christmas
Ooh whoa, whoa, whoa
(Ear drummers)
Whoa, whoa

[Chorus]
I didn't have you under my tree this Christmas
But I had you all over my wish list
Oh oh oh, whoa
You're not under my mistletoe
I didn't have you under my tree this Christmas
But I had you all over my wish list
Oh oh oh, whoa
You're not under my mistletoe
Oh oh oh, whoa
The weather outside is cold

[Verse 1]
I was standing by the fire
Thinking I should write her
Doves cry from a songbird
Skipping heartbeats, it's my turn
Light a candle, wish you were here
What a way to start the new year
Disappear into my nightmare
I expected you to stay there
You're the only star that I see
Gone, gone, where you hiding?
Oh baby, were you lonely?
Don't leave a nigga tearing
Wipe the eyes if you crying
Holiday's been quiet
Holiday's pretty quiet

[Chorus]
I didn't have you under my tree this Christmas
But I had you all over my wish list
Oh oh oh, whoa
You're not under my mistletoe
Oh oh oh, whoa
The weather outside is cold (Cold)

[Verse 2]
All on my own, don't remind
I need recovery time
I'm losing you and I'm fine
Eggnog, I switch to the wine
First I was waiting on E
Never thought I'd see the day you would leave
Stop by, I need a relief
Stop by, I'm in disbelief
I gave you the world
Lord knows I tried
Lord knows that I tried
Lord knows I tried
I didn't see you when I opened up my eyes
When I opened up my eyes

[Chorus]
I didn't have you under my tree this Christmas
But I had you all over my wish list
Oh oh oh, whoa
You're not under my mistletoe
Oh oh oh, whoa
The weather outside is cold
It's cold, cold
The weather outside is cold
It's cold, it's cold

[Verse 1]
Winter's over, let the sun in
Wife-beater on me, let's pour the rum
Wife-beater on me, I'll take you on
I'm the closest and you're shinin' like a summer solstice
Everyone's tryna figure you out
On the patio and we're just strung out
And I know what you're into
Fortune tellers couldn't tell you what to do
If I seem like I'm bad news

[Chorus]
Then hide from me, girl
I want a good girl, and you fit the criteria
I'm fuckin' takin' you serious
Hide from me, girl (hide from me, girl)
In love, no typical love
I'm a smokin' gun and I'm still on the run

[Verse 2]
Tan Jeep out front with the Rollie on
Nine deep and we've been away from home too long
I'ma make your bitch choose
Five liters in the cooler
Five liters in the cooler
You can pose with your poodle
Drive fast in your new car
Drive fast in your new car
I'ma give you that bling
Kiss the big face that I love dearly
That nigga ain't near as cool as me
Hate with all your might, I'm coolin', b
And I'm sure you've never had this experience before
Helicopter on the roof, let's soar
And I'm out on the west like Schwartz
Niggas fuckin' up the golf course
So that's what rich niggas are doin' these days
Yeah we get money like 10, 12 ways
And on a restless night
She gon' take me where I need to go
In the backseat of the Maybach, where we used to get on
And you want real love
One that'll make you feel like you just woke up

[Chorus]
I think you better hide from me, girl
I want a good girl, and you fit the criteria
I'm fuckin' takin' you serious
Hide from me, girl (hide from me, girl)
In love, no typical love
I'm a smokin' gun and I'm still on the run

[Intro]
Oh, oh
Oh, oh

[Chorus]
Let the top down for some ventilation (yeah)
Touchscreen navigation, get me to my destination
If you can't get over me, it's because the good vibrations
50 large in my pants like what? (Hey) Like what's the occasion?

[Verse]
Just dunked a girl in the pool
There's plenty room in my SUV when I'm on the avenue
Rich bitch, I'm on to you
If it's mine, it ain't up for grabs
I make 'em pay me in cash
If the last didn't last
It's 'cause they didn't love you like they should have
So I'll get you from the train station
Know you don't mind, so I'll have the tree waitin'
If it's on my mind then it's on yours too
I'll make the first move and I guarantee you'll call me back, yeah
Cupid got a bounty on me (on me)
Trouble done found you
Banded up 'cause you're callin' (ooh)
Banded up 'cause you're callin' (yeah)
And I was homesick these past Februaries
Runnin' around hopin' payback was sweet
Money up, now we really flexin'
I take it out of park like

[Chorus]
Let the top down for some ventilation (yeah)
Touchscreen navigation, get me to my destination
If you can't get over me, it's because the good vibrations
50 large in my pants like, what? (Hey) Like what's the occasion?

[Instrumental Bridge]

[Chorus]
Let the top down for some ventilation (yeah)
Touchscreen navigation, get me to my destination
If you can't get over me, it's because the good vibrations
50 large in my pants like, what? (Hey) Like what's the occasion?

[Intro]
Uh, uh
I'm the one that won't know how it feels
How it feels

[Chorus]
I'm the one that won't know how it feels
But I think we both know how it feels
Gotta make it so hot like fire drills (ayy)
And took a ride 'cause I spent cash on them wheels

[Verse]
Go get your bag, girl, I'm not the third wheel
You're still a bad girl after all these years
Yo, didn't I give you the NyQuil?
So you're on home base and I'ma steal
I picked you up, your chest like the Man of Steel
I might just save that girl like the Man of Steel
I might just pull up on stainless steel
Don't gotta question, 'cause I know she will
Only someone involved can stay the night until (ooh)
But I think we both know how it feels (ooh, yeah)
This morning when we took shots and cheered
You just realized that you had somethin' real (ooh)
But I'm the one that don't know how to deal
I'ma a-a-always seal the deal
I'ma womp, womp, womp then seal the deal
With them diamonds that you can see from here
If they aren't A-list, just leave 'em there
'Cause you'll be hearing about us everywhere
When the squad roll up, they couldn't help but stare
Ayy, I'ma just sit that there
She got a ass, she gon' just sit it right there
I like a bad bitch when she long hair, no care
I won't ever go on no cab
I said, "You wanna take a shot?," she said, "Heck yeah"
Other niggas over there disrespect, yeah
I say, "You tryna be down?," she said, "Heck yeah"
Off the drink, baby, I'm a wreck, yeah
In the backseat, when I get the neck, yeah
Got me runnin' to you for some sex, yeah
But for one night, don't know how to feel
About a heartbreak story in Encino Hills

[Chorus]
I'm the one that won't know how it feels
But I think we both know how it feels
Gotta make it so hot like fire drills
And took a ride 'cause I spent cash on them wheels
Go get your bag, girl, I'm not the third wheel

[Intro]
Hey, hey
Hey
Chopsquad
Ooh
In the heat of the moment, I know I can...
Yeah
DJ the beast on this banger!

[Chorus]
In the heat of the moment, in the heat of the moment
In the heat of the moment I know I can trust myself
In the heat of the moment, in the heat of the moment
In the heat of the moment, I can count on myself
In the heat of the moment, in the heat of the moment
In the heat of the moment I know I can trust myself
In the heat of the moment, in the heat of the moment
In the heat of the moment, I can count on myself

[Verse 1]
It's no suggestion comin' from me, I'm just somebody that cares
And you can front like you don't feel me, you most definitely care
And if there's some kinda hold on your love or your heart then baby, why lie?
You're killin' me like a homicide, needin' more excitement for your double life
Here's the drugs for your sore eyes, from friends that are hard to come by
Let's just hope that my phones don't die, so you can reach me
I know I'm changin' for sure, lay in the lowest of love
And you saw me transform and there was no cure

[Chorus]
In the heat of the moment, in the heat of the moment
In the heat of the moment I know I can trust myself
In the heat of the moment, in the heat of the moment
In the heat of the moment, I can count on myself

[Verse 2]
I wonder sometimes, if the one that's passed me by
I wonder sometimes, if somebody's lovin' you right
Table's turned all of a sudden, ridin' by my side, like on a trollie
Father, God, they want my money, heart on fire, they never could crush it
Twisting up my dialogue, sorry, but I'm wide-wide eye buggin'
Something else you need from me but would you even take a bullet?
Let me buy your time even though I wiped off your kiss
And I shouldn't say too much because it's what I do that really sinks in

[Chorus]
In the heat of the moment, in the heat of the moment
In the heat of the moment I know I can trust myself
In the heat of the moment, in the heat of the moment
In the heat of the moment, I can count on myself
In the heat of the moment, in the heat of the moment
In the heat of the moment I know I can trust myself
In the heat of the moment, in the heat of the moment
In the heat of the moment, I can count on myself

[Verse 1]
Don't you run away (hol' up)
I caught you on a wave (yeah)
I'm not tryna follow the blind
And you not tryna be left behind
It takes more than two shots (ooh)
To wipe my memory clean
And I was bustin' in blocks
Just to hear you sing (oh, oh, oh, girl)

[Chorus]
Good girl (hey), I'll see you in the daytime
I'm just too lit for white wine (yeah)
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Good girl (hey), I'll see you in the daytime
I'm just too lit for red wine (lit)
Yeah, yeah, yeah (uh huh)

[Verse 2]
You wanted to go down in this place
This good gas has me in a good space
Between the money and the women
I wake up still in a daze
Daze, daze
No roleplay
Can't roleplay
Oh, yeah
Enjoy your trip
Just be you and I'll be all that I can be
This love got you borderline crazy
I crashed on your shore, oh
And now let's move forward

[Intro]
What's in these drinks I spilled?
Baby, don't tell me no lie
I don't have time for this
Drinkin' this, pourin' your soul out

[Chorus]
What's in this cup for real? (For real?)
What's in this cup for real? (for real, for real, for real, for real, for real)
Was this chick for real? (For real?) Was this bitch for real?
(for real, for real, for real, for real, for real)
What's in your heart, for real? (For real?)
What's in your heart, for real? (For real?) (for real, for real, for real, for real, for real)
What's in your heart, for real? (Is in your heart for real?)
What's in your heart, for real? (Is in your heart for real)
(what's in your)

[Verse]
I'm gonna pass this time I wouldn't want you to find (find)
I left the house last night 'cause there was too many vibes (too many vibes)
Drivin' me while she wild, I cannot steer (cannot steer), baby wanna come be near (wanna come near)
Drivin' me while I cannot steer (cannot steer), baby wanna come near (come near)
But my eyes criss and cross and I'm already gone and it's not hard to see (to see)
Plus that over-the-counter was put to good use, yeah, that's just what I did
I could tell she ready when she came up out her shirt and she laid up on me
Do what you feel and I feel what you say and I see what you mean

[Chorus]
What's in this cup for real? What's in this cup for real?
Was this chick for real? Was this bitch for real?
(for real, for real, for real, for real, for real)
What's in your heart, for real? What's in your heart, for real?
(for real, for real, for real, for real, for real)
What's in your heart, for real? What's in your heart, for real?
(for real, for real, for real, for real, for real)

[Bridge]
I already told you, you already froze up, I am really frozen
I already told you, I already rolled up
What's in your heart, for real? What's in your heart, for real?
(for real, for real, for real, for real, for real)
What's in your heart, for real? What's in your heart, for real?
(for real, for real, for real, for real, for real)

[Outro]
What's in these drinks I spilled? Baby, don't tell me no lie
I don't have time for this, drinkin' this, pourin' your soul out
What's in these drinks I spilled? Baby, don't tell me no lie
I don't have time for this, drinkin' this, pourin' your soul out

[Intro]
Under my tree this Christmas
Ooh whoa, woah, woah
Ear drummers
Woah, woah

[Chorus]
I don't have you under my tree this Christmas
But I had you all over my wishlist
Oh, oh, oh, woah
You're not under my mistletoe

All on my own, don't remind
I need recovery time

Never thought I'd see the day you would leave

The weather outside is cold
It's cold, it's cold

[Verse 1: Swae Lee]
It's not good enough for me
Since I've been with you, ooh
It's not gonna work for you
Nobody can equal me (I know)
I'm gonna sip on this drink, when I'm fucked up
I should know how to pick up
I'm gonna catch the rhythm
While she push up against me, ooh, is she tipsy?
I had enough convo for 24
I peep'd you from across the room
Pretty little body, dancin' like GoGo, hey
And you are unforgettable
I need to get you alone (oeh)
Why not? A fuckin' good time never hurt nobody
I got a little drink, but it's not Bacardi
If you loved the girl, then I'm so, so sorry
I gotta give it to her like we in a marriage
Oh, like we in a hurry
No, no, I won't tell nobody
You're on your level too
Tryna do what lovers do
You don't gotta search hard to find me
With the money is where I'll be
With the cash, yeah, that's where I'll be
Give it up, baby, no stopping

[Chorus: Wizkid]
My gyal
You bad, You bad
But mi no want this forever
Oh yeah
My gyal, you bad, you bad, you bad
But mi no want this forever
Ooh yeah

[Bridge: Wizkid]
Would you leave with me tonight?
Get high, get fucked with me tonight?
I don't want this thing for life
My gyal come rock with me tonight

[Verse 2: Swae Lee]
I can provide the good vibe
I keep a hot one by my side
And if you choose then you better chose wisely
Me not coming in clutch is unlikely
You're gonna hurt somebody
The way you move your waist you're gonna hurt somebody
You don't owe nobody nothing
Girl, what you got for me?
What you got for me?
I love you long time, that's a guarantee
I switch time zones just to come see
I got your mind blown, yeah, easy
Don't want to fall, just want to taste
Tell me yes, don't reply maybe
Why we gotta do so much talking?
I'm tryna make it through the crowd, baby

[Chorus: Wizkid]
You bad, you bad
But mi no want this forever
Forever

[Verse 3: Swae Lee (& Wizkid)]
You know what your body wants to do
Why you gotta think this through (ooh yeah)
You fucking with the midnight crew
Playing your favorite tunes
You tryna find that feel from way back when
I'm speeding with the roof caved in
You can say that somebody's out to get ya
I'm for real, ain't nobody filthy richer
Give me that look one more time, baby
Yeah, It's over
I got the Colorado pack, it's over
Yeah, yeah
I make time for what I want
Meet me back at the room
Since you're in the mood
You're gonna hurt somebody
The way you move your waist you're gonna hurt somebody
You don't owe nobody nothing...

[Outro: Swae Lee]
Drug me
I'm smoking, blowing Os, and feeling stars
Getting so high off my supply
I do it so easy, I don't try
Can't you see yourself with me tonight?
I don't want to hurt you, fuss, and fight
I'm gon' do you make you close your eyes
All in favor, please say I
Call your job and tell them you'll be late

Damn her hair standin' up
She just wanna party though
She heard we be blowin' money
Turn it into particles
When we hit the fuckin' city
We gon' make the articles
Yeah, yeah
Catch me veerin' in the median
I'm in that brand new ghost
When I pull up to the club
You know the hoes gon' touch their toes
Countin' bills, fuckin' hoes simultaneous
That girl so spontaneous
And she give me cranium
I might pull up with a DVD
And DVD your ho
Catch me flyin' down the median
I'm blowin' fuckin' smoke
I might blow it out the gas
Means I'm blowin' out my nose
Yeah you know I let that money talk
That paper fuckin' spoke
Ayy, drop top Vipers, we get all our food to go
I might take the top up off that bitch
And put it on the floor
You can't see me in the spot
I'm higher than a UFO
I got bitches out in London
And got hoes in Tokyo, let's go

Every dog has his day
Sick 'em, sick 'em
Lil' nigga you can hate
Jig 'em, jig 'em
Hundred G's on the table
Flip 'em, flip 'em
Everybody ain't able
Drill 'em, drill 'em
Got a duplex with a crazy view
Throw the cash up, make her hula hoop
Pinkie ring on igloo
Backwoods crushin' grapefruit juice
Pull a 60 out the pouch like a kangaroo

Told y'all I wasn't fuckin' playin'
Say you love me, bitch, say it don't spray it
Blow the 50s layer by layer, yeah

Snuck backstage with no wristband

Thinkin' in a bad way, losin' your grip
Screamin' at my face, baby, don't trip
Someone took a big L, don't know how that felt
Lookin' at you sideways, party on tilt
Ooh-ooh, some things you just can't refuse
She wanna ride me like a cruise and I'm not tryna lose

[Chorus]
Then you're left in the dust, unless I stuck by ya
You're a sunflower, I think your love would be too much
Or you'll be left in the dust, unless I stuck by ya
You're the sunflower, you're the sunflower

[Verse 2]
And I suck at texting, you're a reflection of me
Asking for my trust is a little too much
Running right on, oh (Right, oh), running right on, oooh
She think I'm shallow (Yeah), she want me, but what do I know?
That money follow, we don't pose for the photos
Ridin' round, oh, ohh, ridin' round, oh

You're a sunflower, I think your love would be too much
Or you'll be left in the dust, unless I stuck by ya
You're the sunflower, you're the sunflower

Ice on- ice on my necklace, I am a skier

They stay at the drag of my feet, I stick to the speed limit
They playing ???, my paycheck is Fiji (Yeah)
We smoke gas, this is that helium
Huffing and pass it, it taste like it's premium

She's rich, she's fucking, not teasing
Thought you was doing it like me, but, you were just dreaming
I sweat out the money, I sweat I'm on Fendi
My wrist a compass, bust down the circumference
She foreign as can be, soon as we greet, we kiss on both cheeks
I'm picking up wings, I'm picking up speed, I'm taking the lead

Love you like I'll never see you again
Only real 'cause I'm not for pretend (No)
Reaching out with your arms extended
My love is emergency and I can sense the urgency (Ya-aah)
Come, let me, woah-oh-oh
Your body is just for me (For me)
It was like sorcery
She left me like an alcoholic
Find more time, I wish I could just buy more
Honey's my life, appreciate me now-now-now
Finesse more time, I wish it cold be better
I want you more than I want bottles

I don't care bout who you are, you gon' give me my respect
Give me my respect, you gon' give me my respect

Know I'll give you yours but you will give me respect
You will give me respect, know you will give me respect

So strong, So strong, who's taking you home ...?
Are you kidding me talking about quality ...
Must've felt good to be up in the lies
Trusting your gut, you better trust your right mind
....
Feel the orderly life
I expect you to look me dead in the eye

[Intro]
You sound like a bitch, bitch
Shut the fuck up
When your fans become your haters
You done?
Fuckin' beard's weird
Alright
You yellin' at the mic, fuckin' weird beard (You want smoke)
We doin' this once
You yellin' at the mic, your beard's weird
Why you yell at the mic? (Illa)

[Verse]
Rihanna just hit me on a text
Last night I left hickeys on her neck
Wait, you just dissed me? I'm perplexed
Insult me in a line, compliment me on the next
Damn, I'm really sorry you want me to have a heart attack
Was watchin' 8 Mile on my NordicTrack
Realized I forgot to call you back
Here's that autograph for your daughter, I wrote it on a Starter cap
Stan, Stan, son
Listen, man, Dad isn't mad
But how you gonna name yourself after a damn gun
And have a man-bun?
The giant's woke, eyes open, undeniable
Supplyin' smoke, got the fire stoked
Say you got me in a scope, but you grazed me
I say one call to Interscope and you're Swayze
Your reply got the crowd yelling, "Woo!"
So before you die let's see who can out-petty who
With your corny lines ("Slim, you're old")'ow, Kelly, ooh
But I'm 45 and I'm still outselling you
By 29, I had three albums that had blew
Now let's talk about somethin' I don't really do
Go in someone's daughter's mouth stealin' food
But you're a fuckin' mole hill
Now I'ma make a mountain out of you, woo!
Ho, chill, actin' like you put the chrome barrel to my bone marrow
Gunner? Bitch, you ain't a bow and arrow
Say you'll run up on me like a phone bill, sprayin' lead (Brrt)
Playin' dead, that's the only time you hold still (Hold up)
Are you eating cereal or oatmeal?
What the fuck's in the bowl, milk? Wheaties or Cheerios?
'Cause I'm takin' a shit in 'em, Kelly, I need reading material
'Dictionary'
"Yo, Slim, your last four albums sucked
Go back to Recovery," oh shoot, that was three albums ago
What do you know? Oops
Know your facts before you come at me, lil' goof
Luxury, oh, you broke, bitch? Yeah, I had enough money in '02
To burn it in front of you, ho
Younger me? No, you the wack me, it's funny but so true
I'd rather be 80-year-old me than 20-year-old you
'Til I'm hitting old age
Still can fill a whole page with a 10-year-old's rage
Got more fans than you in your own city, lil' kiddy, go play
Feel like I'm babysitting Lil Tay
Got the Diddy okay so you spent your whole day
Shootin' a video just to fuckin' dig your own grave
Got you at your own wake, I'm the billy goat
You ain't never made a list next to no Biggie, no Jay
Next to Taylor Swift and that Iggy ho, you about to really blow
Kelly, they'll be putting your name
Next to Ja, next to Benzino'die, motherfucker!
Like the last motherfucker sayin' Hailie in vain
Alien brain, you Satanist (Yeah)
My biggest flops are your greatest hits
The game's mine again and ain't nothin' changed but the locks
So before I slay this bitch I, mwah, give Jade a kiss
Gotta wake up Labor Day to this (The fuck?)
Bein' rich-shamed by some prick usin' my name for clickbait
In a state of bliss 'cause I said his goddamn name
Now I gotta cock back, aim
Yeah, bitch, pop Champagne to this! (Pop)
It's your moment
This is it, as big as you're gonna get, so enjoy it
Had to give you a career to destroy it
Lethal injection
Go to sleep six feet deep, I'll give you a B for the effort
But if I was three-foot-eleven
You'd look up to me, and for the record
You would suck a dick to fuckin' be me for a second
Lick a ballsack to get on my channel
Give your life to be as solidified
This mothafuckin' shit is like Rambo when he's out of bullets
So what good is a fuckin' machine gun when it's outta ammo?
Had enough of this tatted-up mumble rapper
How the fuck can him and I battle?
He'll have to fuck Kim in my flannel
I'll give him my sandals
'Cause he knows, long as I'm Shady he's gon' have to live in my shadow
Exhausting, letting off on my offspring
Lick a gun barrel, bitch, get off me!
You dance around it like a sombrero, we can all see
You're fuckin' salty
'Cause Young Gerald's balls-deep inside of Halsey
Your red sweater, your black leather
You dress better, I rap better
That a death threat or a love letter?
Little white toothpick
Thinks it's over a pic, I just don't like you, prick
Thanks for dissing me
Now I had an excuse on the mic to write "Not Alike"
But really I don't care who's in the right
But you're losin' the fight you picked
Who else want it? Kells'attempt fails! Budden'L's!
Fuckin' nails in these coffins as soft as Cottonelle
Killshot, I will not fail, I'm with the Doc still
But this idiot's boss pops pills and tells him he's got skills
But, Kells, the day you put out a hit's the day Diddy admits
That he put the hit out that got Pac killed, ah!
I'm sick of you bein' wack
And still usin' that mothafuckin' Auto-Tune
So let's talk about it (Let's talk about it)
I'm sick of your mumble rap mouth
Need to get the cock up out it
Before we can even talk about it (Talk about it)
I'm sick of your blonde hair and earrings
Just 'cause you look in the mirror and think
That you're Marshall Mathers (Marshall Mathers)
Don't mean you are, and you're not about it
So just leave my dick in your mouth and keep my daughter out it

[Outro]
You fuckin''oh
And I'm just playin', Diddy
You know I love you

Look, if you had one shot or one opportunity
To seize everything you ever wanted in one moment
Would you capture it, or just let it slip? Yo

[Verse 1]
His palms are sweaty, knees weak, arms are heavy
There's vomit on his sweater already, mom's spaghetti
He's nervous, but on the surface he looks calm and ready
To drop bombs, but he keeps on forgetting
What he wrote down, the whole crowd goes so loud
He opens his mouth, but the words won't come out
He's choking, how? Everybody's joking now
The clock's run out, time's up, over'blaow!
Snap back to reality, ope there goes gravity, ope
There goes Rabbit, he choked, he's so mad but he won't
Give up that easy, no, he won't have it, he knows
His whole back's to these ropes, it don't matter, he's dope
He knows that but he's broke, he's so stagnant, he knows
When he goes back to this mobile home, that's when it's
Back to the lab again yo, this old rap shit, he
Better go capture this moment and hope it don't pass him, and

[Chorus]
You better lose yourself in the music
The moment, you own it, you better never let it go (Go!)
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo
You better lose yourself in the music
The moment, you own it, you better never let it go (Go!)
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo
You better'

[Verse 2]
His soul's escaping through this hole that is gaping
This world is mine for the taking, make me king
As we move toward a New World Order
A normal life is boring; but superstardom's
Close to post-mortem, it only grows harder
Homie grows hotter, he blows, it's all over
These hoes is all on him, coast-to-coast shows
He's known as the Globetrotter, lonely roads
God only knows, he's grown farther from home, he's no father
He goes home and barely knows his own daughter
But hold your nose, 'cause here goes the cold water
These hoes don't want him no mo', he's cold product
They moved on to the next schmoe who flows
He nose-dove and sold nada, and so the soap opera
Is told, it unfolds, I suppose it's old, partner
But the beat goes on: da-da-dom, da-dom, dah-dah, dah-dah

[Chorus]
You better lose yourself in the music
The moment, you own it, you better never let it go (Go!)
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo
You better lose yourself in the music
The moment, you own it, you better never let it go (Go!)
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo
You better'

[Verse 3]
No more games, I'ma change what you call rage
Tear this motherfuckin' roof off like two dogs caged
I was playin' in the beginning, the mood all changed
I've been chewed up and spit out and booed off stage
But I kept rhymin' and stepped right in the next cypher
Best believe somebody's payin' the Pied Piper
All the pain inside amplified by the
Fact that I can't get by with my nine-to-
Five and I can't provide the right type of life for my family
'Cause man, these goddamn food stamps don't buy diapers
And there's no movie, there's no Mekhi Phifer, this is my life
And these times are so hard, and it's gettin' even harder
Tryna feed and water my seed, plus teeter-totter
Caught up between bein' a father and a prima donna
Baby mama drama, screamin' on her, too much for me to wanna
Stay in one spot, another day of monotony's
Gotten me to the point I'm like a snail, I've got
To formulate a plot or end up in jail or shot
Success is my only motherfuckin' option'failure's not
Mom, I love you, but this trailer's got
To go; I cannot grow old in Salem's Lot
So here I go, it's my shot: feet, fail me not
This may be the only opportunity that I got

[Chorus]
You better lose yourself in the music
The moment, you own it, you better never let it go (Go!)
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo
You better lose yourself in the music
The moment, you own it, you better never let it go (Go!)
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo
You better'

You can do anything you set your mind to, man

[Intro: Rihanna]
I'm friends with the monster that's under my bed
Get along with the voices inside of my head
You're tryin' to save me, stop holdin' your breath
And you think I'm crazy, yeah, you think I'm crazy

[Verse 1: Eminem]
I wanted the fame but not the cover of Newsweek
Oh well, guess beggars can't be choosey
Wanted to receive attention for my music
Wanted to be left alone in public, excuse me
For wantin' my cake, and eat it too, and wantin' it both ways
Fame made me a balloon 'cause my ego inflated
When I blew, see, but it was confusing
'Cause all I wanted to do's be the Bruce Lee of loose leaf
Abused ink, used it as a tool when I blew steam
Whoo! Hit the lottery, ooh-wee
But with what I gave up to get it was bittersweet
It was like winnin' a used mink
Ironic 'cause I think I'm gettin' so huge I need a shrink
I'm beginnin' to lose sleep: one sheep, two sheep
Goin' coo-coo and kooky as Kool Keith
But I'm actually weirder than you think, 'cause I'm'

[Chorus: Rihanna & (Bebe Rexha)]
I'm friends with the monster that's under my bed
Get along with the voices inside of my head
You're tryin' to save me, stop holdin' your breath

[Verse 2: Eminem]
Now, I ain't much of a poet
But I know somebody once told me to seize the moment
And don't squander it 'cause you never know when it all
Could be over tomorrow, so I keep conjurin'
Sometimes I wonder where these thoughts spawn from
Yeah, ponderin'll do you wonders
No wonder you're losin' your mind, the way it wanders
Yodel-odel-ay-hee-hoo! I think it went wanderin' off down yonder
And stumbled onto Jeff VanVonderen
'Cause I need an interventionist
To intervene between me and this monster
And save me from myself and all this conflict
'Cause the very thing that I love's killin' me and I can't conquer it
My OCD's conkin' me in the head, keep knockin'
Nobody's home, I'm sleepwalkin'
I'm just relayin' what the voice in my head's sayin'
Don't shoot the messenger, I'm just friends with the'

[Chorus: Rihanna & (Bebe Rexha)]
I'm friends with the monster that's under my bed
Get along with the voices inside of my head
You're tryin' to save me, stop holdin' your breath
And you think I'm crazy, yeah, you think I'm crazy
Well, that's nothin' (Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)

Well, that's nothin' (Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
(Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)

[Verse 3: Eminem]
Call me crazy, but I have this vision, one day that
I'll walk amongst you a regular civilian
But until then, drums get killed and
I'm comin' straight at MC's, blood gets spilled and
I'll take you back to the days that I'd get on a Dre track
Give every kid who got played that pumped-up feelin'
And shit to say back to the kids who played him
I ain't here to save the fuckin' children
But if one kid out of a hundred million
Who are goin' through a struggle, feels it and relates, that's great!
It's payback, Russell Wilson fallin' way back
In the draft, turn nothin' into somethin', still can make that
Straw into gold, chump, I will spin'Rumpelstiltskin in a haystack
Maybe I need a straightjacket
Face facts: I am nuts for real, but I'm okay with that!
It's nothin', I'm still friends with the'

[Chorus: Rihanna]
I'm friends with the monster that's under my bed
Get along with the voices inside of my head
You're tryin' to save me, stop holdin' your breath
And you think I'm crazy, yeah, you think I'm crazy

I'm friends with the monster that's under my bed

Woah, Joyner, Joyner, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Pre-Chorus: Joyner Lucas]
Yeah, I done did a lot of things in my day, I admit it
I don't take back what I say, if I said it then I meant it
All my life I want a Grammy, but I'll prolly never get it
I ain't never had no trophy or no motherfuckin' ribbon (Yah I said it)
Fuck the system, I'm that nigga, bend the law, cut the rules
I'm about to risk it all, I ain't got too much to lose
Y'all been eatin' long enough, it's my turn to cut the food
Pass the plate! Where my drink? This my day, lucky you
Fuck you too, woo!

[Chorus: Joyner Lucas]
Y'all gotta move, y'all gotta move, y'all gotta move
Give me some room, give me some room, give me the juice
Hop out the coupe, hop out the coupe, hop out and shoot
Y'all gotta move, y'all gotta move, give me the juice

[Verse 1: Joyner Lucas]
Back on my bullshit, my back to the wall
Turn my back on you, all of you finished
Back to these bullets, it's back to the job
Pull my MAC out and all of you runnin'
Back on my hood shit, it's back to the pushin'
These packs and I'm actually pumpin'
Can't fuck with you rappers, you practically suckin'
You mighta went platinum but that don't mean nothin'
I'm actually buzzin' this time
Straight out the kitchen, I told 'em the oven is mine
I do not fuck with you guys
If I don't kill you, just know you gon' suffer this time
I ain't no gangster but I got some bangers
Some chains and some blades and a couple of knives
Choppers and jammies, a partridge, a pear tree
My 12 days of Christmas was nothin' but lies (I)
Run at you hard like a sumo (Sumo)
They say I talk like a chulo (Chulo)
I live in Mars, I'm not Bruno (Woo)
Bitch I'm a dog, call me Cujo (Rah)
You play your cards, I reverse on you all
And I might just draw 4 like a Uno (Bup)
C'llate boca mejor, maric'n, little puto, and all of you culo (Joyner)
They've invented a level up in the ghetto to get old
Lookin' for somethin' I prolly can never find now
Shit get relevant 'til 'nother beef die down
In truth, a nigga just really want me tied down
I've been alone and I never needed nobody
Just only me and my shotty, I'll tell these niggas to lie down
Keep all the money, I never wanted the lifestyle
I just pray to God that my son'll be alright now
I said ain't no love for the other side
Or anyone who ever want smoke (Joyner)
When I die I'm goin' out as the underdog who never lost hope (Yeah)
You in the wrong cab down the wrong path
Nigga, wrong way, wrong road (Woo, woo)
Snakes in the grass tryna slither fast
I just bought a fuckin' lawn mower (Vroom!)

[Pre-Verse: Eminem]
I done said a lotta things in my day, I admit it
This is payback in a way, I regret it that I did it
I done won a couple Grammys, but I sold my soul to get 'em
Wasn't in it for the trophies, just the fuckin' recognition
Fuck's the difference?
I'm that cracker, bend the law, fuck the rules
Man, I used to risk it all, now I got too much to lose
I've been eatin' long enough, man, my stomach should be full
I just ate, licked the plate, my buffet, lucky me
Fuck you think? (Woo!)

[Verse 2: Eminem]
I got a couple of mansions
Still I don't have any manners
You got a couple of ghost writers
But to these kids it don't actually matter
They're askin' me, "What the fuck happened to hip-hop?"
I said, "I don't have any answers."
'Cause I took an L when I dropped my last album
It hurt me like hell but I'm back on these rappers
And actually comin' from humble beginnings
I'm somewhat uncomfortable winning
I wish I could say, "What a wonderful feeling!"
"We're on the upswing like we're punchin' the ceiling!"
But nothin' is feeling like anyone has any fuckin' ability
To even stick to a subject, it's killin' me
The inability to pen humility
Ha-ta-ta ba-ta-ta, why don't we make a bunch of
Fuckin' songs about nothin' and mumble 'em?
Fuck it, I'm goin' for the jugular
Shit is a circus, you clowns that are comin' up
Don't give an ounce of a motherfuck
About the ones that were here before you that made rap
Let's recap, way back, MC's that wreak havoc on tape decks
ADAT's, where the G Raps and Kanes at?
We need 3 Stacks ASAP and bring Masta Ace back
'Cause half of these rappers have brain damage
All the lean rappin', face tats, syruped out like tree sap
I don't hate trap, and I don't wanna seem mad
But in fact, where the old me at? The same cat
That would take that feedback and aim back, I need that
But I think it's inevitable
They know what button to press or what lever to pull
To get me to snap though (Lil' bitch)
And if I pay it attention I'm prob'ly makin' it bigger
But you've been takin' ya digs in the fuckin' back, ho (Get it?)
On the brink, any minute got me thinkin' of finishin'
Everything with acetaminophen and reapin' the benefits
I'm asleep at the wheel again
As I peak into thinkin' about an evil intent
Of another beat I'ma kill again
'Cause even if I gotta end up eatin' a pill again
Even ketamine or methamphetamine with the minithin
It better be at least 70 or 300 milligram
And I might as well 'cause I'ma end up bein' a villain again
Levels to this shit, I got an elevator
You could never say to me I'm not a fuckin' record breaker
I sound like a broken record every time I break a record
Nobody could ever take away the legacy I made, I never cater
Motherfucker, now I got a right to be this way
I got spite inside my DNA
But I wrote 'til the wheels fall off, I'm workin' tirelessly, ayy
It's the moment y'all been waitin' for
Like California wishin' rain to pour
In that drought, y'all been prayin' for
My downfall from the 8 Mile to the Southpaw
Still the same Marshall, that outlaw
That they say as a writer might've fell off
I'm back on that bull like the cowboy

[Chorus: Joyner Lucas & Eminem]
So y'all gotta move (Yeah), y'all gotta move (Yeah), y'all gotta move
Give me some room, give me some room, give me the juice
Hop out the coupe, hop out the coupe, hop out and shoot
Y'all gotta move, y'all gotta move, give me the juice

[Intro]
*Plane crash*
Yeah (Illa, Illa, Illa)
Yo, I'm just gonna write down my first thoughts, and see where this takes me, 'cause I feel like I wanna punch the world in the fuckin' face right now
Yeah

[Verse]
Let me explain just how to make greatness
Straight out the gate, I'm 'bout to break it down
Ain't no mistakes allowed, but make no mistake, I'm 'bout
To rape the alphabet, I may raise some brows
If I press the issue just to get the anger out (Brrr!)
Full magazine could take Staples out
Savage but ain't thinkin' 'bout no bank account
But bitch, I'm off the chain like Kala Brown
Motherfucker, shut the fuck up when I'm talkin', lil' bitch
I'm sorry, wait, what's your talent? Oh, critiquin'
My talent? Oh, bitch, I don't know who the fuck y'all are
To give a sub-par bar or even have an opinion or view
You mention me, millions of views, attention in news
I mention you, lose-lose for me, win-win for you
Billions of views, your ten cents are two
Skim through the music to give shit reviews
To get clicks, but bitch, you just lit the fuse
Don't get misconstrued, business as us'
Shit-list renewed, so get shit to do
Or get dissed 'cause I just don't get
What the fuck half the shit is that you're listenin' to
Do you have any idea how much I hate this choppy flow
Everyone copies though? Prob'ly no
Get this fuckin' audio out my Audi, yo, adi's
I can see why people like Lil Yachty, but not me though
Not even dissin', it just ain't for me
All I am simply is just an emcee
Maybe "Stan" just isn't your cup of tea (Get it?)
Maybe your cup's full of syrup and lean
Maybe I need to stir up shit, preferably
Shake the world up if it were up to me
Paul wants me to chill, y'all want me to ill
I should eat a pill, probably I will
Old me killed the new me, watch him bleed to death
I breathe on the mirror, I don't see my breath
Possibly I'm dead, I must be possessed
Like an evil spell, I'm E-V-I-L ("Evil" spelled)
Jam a Crest Whitestrip in the tip of my dick
With an ice pick, stick it in a vise grip
Hang it on a spike fence, bang it with a pipe wrench
While I take my ball sack and flick it like a light switch
Like Vice President Mike Pence
Back up on my shit in a sidekick as I lay it on a spike strip
These are things that I'd rather do than hear you on a mic
Since nine tenths of your rhyme is about ice and
Jesus Christ, man, how many times is
Someone gonna fuck on my bitch? (Fuck my side chick!)
You won't ever see Em icy
But as cold as I get on the M-I-C
I polarize shit, so the Thames might freeze
And your skull might split like I bashed you upside it
Bitch, I got the club on smash like a nightstick (Yeah)
Turn down for what?
I ain't loud enough, nah, turn the Valium up (Illa, Illa, Illa)
'Cause I don't know how I'm gonna get your mouths to shut
Now when it doesn't matter what caliber
I spit at, I'll bet a hundred thousand bucks
You'll turn around and just be like, "Man, how the fuck
Sourpuss gonna get mad just 'cause his album sucks?
And now he wants to take it out on us" (Ooouuu)
But last week, an ex-fan mailed me a copy
Of The Mathers LP to tell me to study
It'll help me get back to myself and she'll love me (Ooouuu)
I mailed the bitch back and said if I did that
I'd just be like everyone else in the fucking industry
Especially an effing Recovery clone of me (NFing)
So finger-bang, chicken wang, MGK, Igg' Azae'
Lil Pump, Lil Xan imitate Lil Wayne
I should aim at everybody in the game, pick a name
I'm fed up with bein' humble
And rumor is I'm hungry, I'm sure you heard rumblings
I heard you wanna rumble like an empty stomach
I heard your mumblin' but it's jumbled in mumbo-jumbo
The era that I'm from will pummel you, that's what it's comin' to
What the fuck you're gonna do when you run into it?
I'm gonna crumble you and I'll take a number two
And dump on you, if you ain't Joyner
If you ain't Kendrick or Cole or Sean, then you're a goner
I'm 'bout to bring it to anyone in this bitch who want it
I guess when you walk into BK you expect a Whopper
You can order a Quarter Pounder when you go to McDonald's
But if you're lookin' to get a porterhouse you better go get Revival
But y'all are actin' like I tried to serve you up a slider
Maybe the vocals shoulda been auto-tuned
And you woulda bought it
But sayin' I no longer got it
'Cause you missed a line and never caught it
'Cause it went over your head, because you're too stupid to get it
'Cause you're mentally retarded, but pretend to be the smartest
With your expertise and knowledge, but you'll never be an artist
And I'm harder on myself than you could ever be regardless
What I'll never be is flawless, all I'll ever be is honest (Illa, Illa, Illa)
Even when I'm gone they're gonna say I brought it
Even when I hit my forties like a fuckin' alcoholic
With a bottle full of malt liquor
But I couldn't bottle this shit any longer
The fact that I know that I'ma hit my bottom
If I don't pull myself from the jaws of defeat and rise to my feet
I don't see why y'all even started with me
I get in beefs, my enemies die
I don't cease fire 'til at least all are deceased
I'm east side, never be caught slippin'
Now you see why I don't sleep, not even a wink, I don't blink
I don't doze off, I don't even nod to the beats
I don't even close my fuckin' eyes when I sneeze
"Aw, man! That BET cypher was weak, it was garbage
The Thing ain't even orange'oh my God, that's a reach!"
Shout to all my colorblind people
Each and everyone of y'all, if you call a fire engine green
Aquamarine, or you think water is pink
"Dawg, that's a date." ' "Looks like an olive to me."
"Look, there's an apple!" ' "No, it's not, it's a peach!"
So finger-bang, Pootie Tang
Burger King, Gucci Gang, dookie, dang
Charlamagne gonna hate anyway, doesn't matter what I say
Give me Donkey of the Day
What a way for 2018 to get underway
But I'm gonna say everything that I wanna say
Welcome to the slaughterhouse, bitch! (Yeah)
Invite 'em in like a One A Day
I'm not done (Preach!)
'Cause I feel like the beast of burden
That line in the sand, was it even worth it?
'Cause the way I see people turning's
Makin' it seem worthless, it's startin' to defeat the purpose
I'm watchin' my fan base shrink to thirds
And I was just tryin' to do the right thing, but word
Has the court of public opinion reached a verdict
Or still yet to be determined?
'Cause I'm determined to be me, critiqued or worshipped
But if I could go back, I'd at least reword it
And say I empathize with the people this evil serpent
Sold the dream to that he's deserted
But I think it's workin'
These verses are makin' him a wee bit nervous
And he's too scurred to answer me with words
'Cause he knows that he will lyrically get murdered
But I know at least he's heard it
'Cause Agent Orange just sent the Secret Service
To meet in person to see if I really think of hurtin' him
Or ask if I'm linked to terrorists
I said, "Only when it comes to ink and lyricists."
But my beef is more media journalists
(Hold up, hold up, hold up)
I said, my beef is more meaty, a journalist
Can get a mouthful of flesh
And yes, I mean eating a penis
'Cause they've been pannin' my album to death
So I've been givin' the media fingers
Don't wanna turn this to a counseling sesh
But they've been puttin' me through the ringer
So I ain't ironin' shit out with the press
But I just took this beat to the cleaners

[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
I've been a liar, been a thief
Been a lover, been a cheat
All my sins need holy water, feel it washing over me
Well, little one, I don't want to admit to something
If all it's gonna cause is pain
Truth and my lies right now are falling like the rain
So let the river run

[Verse 1: Eminem]
He's comin' home with his neck scratched, to catch flack
Sweat jackets and dress slacks, mismatched
On his breath's Jack, he's a sex addict
And she just wants to exact revenge and get back
It's a chess match, she's on his back like a jet-pack
She's kept track of all his Internet chats
And guess who just happens to be movin' on to the next
Actually, just shit on my last chick and she has what my ex lacks
'Cause she loves danger, psychopath
And you don't fuck with no man's girl, even I know that
But she's devised some plan to stab him in the back
Knife in hand, says their relationship's hangin' by a strand
So she's been on the web lately
Says maybe she'll be my Gwen Stacy, to spite her man
And I know she's using me to try to play him, I don't care
Hi Suzanne, but I shoulda said "Bye Suzanne"
After the first night, but tonight I am

[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
I've been a liar, been a thief
Been a lover, been a cheat
All my sins need holy water, feel it washing over me
Well, little one, I don't want to admit to something
If all it's gonna cause is pain
The truth and my lies now are falling like the rain
So let the river run

[Verse 2: Eminem]
A one-night stand turned a two-night stand
It was "come sunlight, scram," now we hug tight, and...
He found out, now she feels deserted and used
'Cause he left, so what? He did it first to her too
Now how am I supposed to tell this girl that we're through?
It's hard to find the words, I'm aloof, nervous, and Sue
Don't want this to hurt, but what you deserve is the truth
Don't take it personal, I just can't say this in person to you
So I revert to the studio, like hole-in-the-wall diners
Don't have to be reserved in a booth
I just feel like the person who I'm turning into's
Irreversible, I preyed on you like it's church at the pew
And now that I got you I don't want you
Took advantage in my thirst to pursue
Why do I do this dirt that I do?
Get on my soapbox and preach, my sermon and speech
Detergent and bleach is burnin' the wound
'Cause now with her in the womb
We can't bring her in this world, shoulda knew
To use protection 'fore I bit into your forbidden fruit
Fuck!

[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
I've been a liar, been a thief
Been a lover, been a cheat
All my sins need holy water, feel it washing over me
Well, little one, I don't want to admit to something
If all it's gonna cause is pain
The truth and my lies now are falling like the rain
So let the river run

[Bridge: Eminem & Ed Sheeran]
My name's (ooh), my name's (ooh)
River (ooh), river run
Call me (ooh), call me (ooh)
River (ooh), we'll let the river run

[Verse 3: Eminem]
Always the bridesmaid, never "The bride, hey!"
Fuck can I say? If life was a highway
And deceit was an enclave, I'd be swerving in five lanes
Speeds at a high rate, like I'm slidin' on ice, maybe
That's why I may have came at you sideways
I can't keep my lies straight
But I made you terminate my baby
This love triangle left us in a wreck, tangled
What else can I say? It was fun for a while
Bet I really woulda loved your smile
Didn't really wanna abort, but fuck it
What's one more lie, to tell our unborn child?

[Chorus: Ed Sheeran & Eminem]
I've been a liar, been a thief
Been a lover, been a cheat
All my sins need holy water, feel it washing over me
Well, little one (I'm sorry)
I don't want to admit to something (I fucked up)
If all it's gonna cause is pain
The truth and my lies now are falling like the rain
So let the river run

[Intro]
I got a song filled with shit for the strong-willed
When the world gives you a raw deal
Sets you off 'til you scream, "Piss off! Screw you!"
When it talks to you like you don't belong
Or tells you you're in the wrong field
When something's in your mitochondrial
'Cause it latched on to you, like'

[Verse 1]
Knock knock, let the devil in
Manevolent as I've ever been, head is spinnin'
This medicine's screamin', "L-L-L-Let us in!"
L-L-L-Like a salad bowl, Edgar Allan Poe
Bedridden, shoulda been dead a long time ago
Liquid Tylenol, gelatins, think my skeleton's meltin'
Wicked, I get all high when I think I've smelled the scent
Of elephant manure'hell, I meant Kahl'a
Screw it, to hell with it, I went through hell with accelerants
And blew up my-my-myself again
Volkswagen, tailspin, bucket matches my pale skin
Mayo and went from Hellmann's and being rail thin
Filet-o-Fish, Scribble Jam, Rap Olympics '97 Freaknik
How can I be down? Me and Bizarre in Florida
Proof's room slept on the floor of 'da motel then
Dr. Dre said, "Hell yeah!"
And I got his stamp like a postcard, word to Mel-Man
And I know they're gonna hate
But I don't care, I barely can wait
To hit 'em with the snare and the bass
Square in the face, this fuckin' world better prepare to get laced
Because they're gonna taste my'

[Chorus]
Venom, (I got that) adrenaline momentum
And I'm not knowin' when I'm
Ever gonna slow up and I'm
Ready to snap any moment I'm
Thinkin' it's time to go get 'em
They ain't gonna know what hit 'em
(W-W-When they get bit with the')
Venom, (I got that) adrenaline momentum
And I'm not knowin' when I'm
Ever gonna slow up and I'm
Ready to snap any moment I'm
Thinkin' it's time to go get 'em
They ain't gonna know what hit 'em
(W-W-When they get bit with the')

[Verse 2]
I said knock knock, let the devil in
Shotgun p-p-pellets in the felt pen
Cocked, fuck around and catch a hot one
It-it's evident I'm not done
V-Venomous, the thoughts spun
Like a web and you just caught in 'em
Held against your will like a hubcap or mud flap
Beat strangler attack
So this ain't gonna feel like a love tap
Eat painkiller pills, fuck up the track
Like, what's her name's at the wheel? Danica Patrick
Threw the car into reverse at the Indy, a nut crashin'
Into ya, the back of it just mangled steel
My Mustang and the Jeep Wrangler grill
With the front smashed, much as my rear fender, assassin
Slim be a combination of an actual kamikaze and Gandhi (Gandhi)
Translation, I will probably kill us both
When I end up backin' into ya
You ain't gonna be able to tell what the fuck's happenin' to ya
When you're bit with the'

[Chorus]
Venom, adrenaline momentum
And I'm not knowin' when I'm
Ever gonna slow up and I'm
Ready to snap any moment I'm
Thinkin' it's time to go get 'em
They ain't gonna know what hit 'em
(W-W-When they get bit with the')
Venom, (I got that) adrenaline momentum
And I'm not knowin' when I'm
Ever gonna slow up and I'm
Ready to snap any moment I'm
Thinkin' it's time to go get 'em
They ain't gonna know what hit 'em
(W-W-When they get bit with the')

[Verse 3]
I said knock knock, let the devil in
Alien, E-E-Elliott phone home
Ain't no telling when this chokehold
On this game will end, I'm loco
Became a Symbiote, so
My fangs are in your throat, ho
You're snake-bitten with my'venom
With the ballpoint pen I'm
Gun cocked, bump stock, double-aught, buckshot
Tire thumper, a garrote, tie a couple knots
Fired up and caught fire, juggernaut
Punk rock, bitch, it's goin' down like Yung Joc
'Cause the Doc put me on like sunblock
Why the fuck not, you only get one shot
Ate shit 'til I can't taste it
Chased it with straight liquor
Then paint thinner, then drank 'til I faint
And awake with a headache
And I take anything in rectangular shape
Then I wait to face the demons I'm bonded to
'Cause they're chasin' me but I'm part of you
So escapin' me is impossible
I latch onto you like a'parasite
And I probably ruined your parents' life
And your childhood too
'Cause if I'm the music that y'all grew up on
I'm responsible for you retarded fools
I'm the super villain Dad and Mom was losin' their marbles to
You marvel that? Eddie Brock is you
And I'm the suit, so call me'

[Chorus]
Venom, (I got that) adrenaline momentum
And I'm not knowin' when I'm
Ever gonna slow up and I'm
Ready to snap any moment I'm
Thinkin' it's time to go get 'em
They ain't gonna know what hit 'em
(W-W-When they get bit with the')
Venom, (I got that) adrenaline momentum
And I'm not knowin' when I'm
Ever gonna slow up and I'm
Ready to snap any moment I'm
Thinkin' it's time to go get 'em
They ain't gonna know what hit 'em
(W-W-When they get bit with the')

[Verse 1: Eminem]
Now this shit's about to kick off, this party looks wack
Let's take it back to straight hip-hop and start it from scratch
I'm 'bout to bloody this track up, everybody get back
That's why my pen needs a pad, 'cause my rhymes on the rag
Just like I did with addiction, I'm 'bout to kick it
Like a magician, critics I turn to crickets
Got 'em still on the fence whether to picket
But quick to get it impaled when I tell 'em, "Stick it!"
So sick, I'm looking pale'wait, that's my pigment
'Bout to go ham, ya bish, shout out to Kendrick
Let's bring it back to that vintage Slim, bitch!
The art of MCing mixed with da Vinci and MC Ren
And I don't mean Stimpy's friend, bitch
Been Public Enemy since you thought PE was gym, bitch

[Pre-Chorus: Eminem]
Kick your shoes off, let your hair down
(And go berserk) All night long
Grow your beard out, just weird out
(And go berserk) All night long

[Chorus 1: Eminem & Billy Squier]
We're gonna rock this house until we knock it down
So turn the volume loud
'Cause it's mayhem 'til the A.M.
So, baby, make just like K-Fed
And let yourself go, let yourself go
Say, "Fuck it!" before we kick the bucket
Life's too short to not go for broke
So everybody, everybody (Go berserk)
Grab your vial, yeah

[Verse 2: Eminem]
Guess it's just the way that I'm dressed, ain't it?
Khakis pressed, Nike shoes crispy and fresh laced
So I guess it ain't that aftershave
Or cologne that made 'em just faint
Plus I showed up with a coat fresher than wet paint
So if love is a chess game, check mate
But girl, your body's bangin', jump me in, dang, bang-bang
Yes siree 'Bob', I was thinking the same thang
So come get on this Kid's rock, baw with da baw, dang-dang
Pow-p-p-p-pow, chica, pow, chica, wow-wow
Got your gal blowin' up a valve, v-v-valve-valve
Ain't slowin' it down, throw in the towel, t-t-towel-towel
Dumb it down, I don't know how, huh-huh, how-how
At least I know that I don't know
Question is, are you bozos smart enough to feel stupid?
Hope so, now ho

[Pre-Chorus: Eminem]
Kick your shoes off, let your hair down
(And go berserk) All night long
Grow your beard out, just weird out
(And go berserk) All night long

[Chorus 2: Eminem & Billy Squier]
We're gonna rock this house until we knock it down
So turn the volume loud
'Cause it's mayhem 'til the A.M.
So crank the bass up like crazy
And let yourself go, let yourself go
Say, "Fuck it!" before we kick the bucket
Life's too short to not go for broke
So everybody, everybody (Go berzerk)
Get your vinyls

[Scratch]

[Verse 3: Eminem]
And they say that love is powerful as cough syrup in styrofoam
All I know is I fell asleep and woke up in that Monte Carlo
With the ugly Kardashian, Lamar, oh
Sorry, yo'we done both set the bar low
Far as hard drugs are though, that's the past
But I done did enough codeine to knock Future into tomorrow
And girl, I ain't got no money to borrow
But I am tryin' to find a way to get you alone: car note
Oh, Marshall Mathers
Shithead with a potty mouth, get the bar of soap lathered
Kangol's and Carheartless Cargos
Girl, you're fixin' to get your heart broke
Don't be absurd, ma'am, you birdbrain, baby
I ain't called anybody baby since Birdman, unless you're a swallow (Ha-ha!)
Word, Rick? Word, man, you heard
But don't get discouraged, girl
This is your jam, unless you got toe jam

[Pre-Chorus: Eminem]
Kick your shoes off, let your hair down
(And go berserk) All night long
Grow your beard out, just weird out
(And go berserk) All night long

[Chorus 1: Eminem & Billy Squier]
We're gonna rock this house until we knock it down
So turn the volume loud
'Cause it's mayhem 'til the A.M.
So, baby, make just like K-Fed
And let yourself go, let yourself go
Say, "Fuck it!" before we kick the bucket
Life's too short to not go for broke
So everybody, everybody (Go berserk)
Grab your vial, yeah

[Chorus 2: Eminem & Billy Squier]
We're gonna rock this house until we knock it down
So turn the volume loud
'Cause it's mayhem 'til the A.M.
So crank the bass up like crazy
And let yourself go, let yourself go
Say, "Fuck it!" before we kick the bucket
Life's too short to not go for broke
So everybody, everybody (Go berzerk)
Get your vinyls

[Intro: Eminem & Justin Vernon]
(Photoshoot!)
You know, everybody's been tellin' me
What they think about me for the last few months
It's too loud
Maybe it's time I tell 'em what I think about them
Can't hear it coming down the hallway stairs from the parking lot
It's too loud
Three's not a crowd all up in it
Slow fire

[Chorus: Justin Vernon]
Don't fall on my face
Don't fall on my faith, oh
Don't fall on my fate
Don't fall on my faith, oh
Don't fall on my fate
Don't fall on my'

[Verse 1: Eminem]
Gotta concentrate, against the clock I race
Got no time to waste, I'm already late, I got a marathoner's pace
Went from addict to a workaholic, word to Dr. Dre
In that first marijuana tape'guess I got a chronic case (Yeah)
And I ain't just blowin' smoke, 'less it's in your momma's face
I know this time Paul and Dre
They won't tell me what not to say (Nope!)
And though me and my party days
Have all pretty much parted ways
You'd swear to God I forgot I'm the guy that made "Not Afraid"
One last time for Charlamagne
If my response is late, it's just how long it takes
To hit my fuckin' radar, I'm so far away
These rappers are like Hunger Games
One minute, they're mockin' JAY
Next minute, they get their style from Migos or they copy Drake
Maybe I just don't know when to turn around and walk away
But all the hate, I call it Walk-on-Water-Gate
I've had as much as I can tolerate
I'm sick and tired of waitin', I done lost my patience
I can take all of you motherfuckers on at once
You wanted Shady? You got him!

[Chorus: Justin Vernon & (Eminem)]
Don't fall on my face (Yeah)
Don't fall on my faith, oh
Don't fall on my fate (Line 'em up!)
Don't fall on my faith, oh (Rrr!)
Don't fall on my fate (Look)

[Verse 2: Eminem]
Somebody tell Budden before I snap, he better fasten it
Or have his body bag get zipped
The closest thing he's had to hits is smackin' bitches (Pump it up!)
And don't make me have to give it back to Akademiks
Say this shit is trash again, I'll have you twisted
Like you had it when you thought you had me slippin' at the telly
Even when I'm gettin' brain, you'll never catch me with a thot
Lacking with it, "He ain't spittin' like this on his last shit"
Ho, you better go back and listen
You know me better, thinkin' I'll slow or let up
Call it trap 'cause it's a total setup
Hopin' that you rappers fall in that
Dre said, "Hold your head up!"'Kathy Griffin
Stackin' ammunition, slap the clip in, cock it back on competition
This is how I shot ahead (Pew)'Gabby Gifford
My attack is vicious, Jack the Ripper, back in business
Tyler create nothin', I see why you called yourself a f*****, bitch
It's not just 'cause you lack attention
It's because you worship D12's balls, you're sack-religious
If you're gonna critique me
You better at least be as good or better
Get Earl the Hooded Sweater
Whatever his name is to help you put together
Some words, more than just two letters
The fans waited for this moment like that feature
When I stole the show (Ha), sorry if I took forever (Ha-ha)

[Chorus: Justin Vernon & (Eminem)]
Don't fall on my face (Yeah)
Don't fall on my faith, oh (I won't)
Don't fall on my fate (Line 'em up!)
Don't fall on my faith, oh (Ha)
Don't fall on my fate (It's too easy)

[Verse 3: Eminem]
Just remember, I was here before you
And I'll be here after you make your run-in for you
Detractors, I might have to fuck Pitchfork with a corkscrew
Just what the doctor ordered
Revenge is the best medicine (Yeah)
Increase the dose, from least to most
And then tell the Grammys to go and fuck themselves
They suck the blood from all the biggest artists like some leeches
So they nominate 'em, get 'em there, get a name to MC the show
Every parasite needs a host (Ha-ha)
Then give Album of the Year to somebody that no one's ever even heard of
All I know is I wrote every single word to everything I ever murdered
Time to separate the sheep from goats (Yeah)
And I got no faith in your writers, I don't believe in ghosts
When rap needed it most, I was that wing and a prayer (Huh)
A beacon of hope, put a B-I-R-D in the air
Somewhere some kid is bumpin' this while he lip-syncs in the mirror
That's who I'm doin' it for, the rest I don't really even care
But you would think I'm carryin' an Oxford dictionary in my pocket
How I'm buryin' these artists
On a scale of 'turnt' you're 'minus'
Mine says 'very', yours says 'hardly'
And what's scary is you prob'ly can compare me to your car 'cause I'm just barely gettin' started (Woo)
And far as Lord Jamar, you better leave me the hell alone
Or I'll show you an Elvis clone
Walk up in this house you own, thrust my pelvic bone
Use your telephone and go fetch me the remote
Put my feet up and just make myself at home (Yeah)
I belong here, clown! Don't tell me 'bout the culture!
I inspired the Hopsins, the Logics, the Coles, the
Seans, the K-Dots, the 5'9"s, and oh
Brought the world 50 Cent, you did squat, piss and moan
But I'm not gonna fall' bitch (Yeah)

[Outro: Justin Vernon]
It's too loud
Can't hear it coming down the hallway stairs from the parking lot
It's too loud
Three's not a crowd all up in it
Slow fire

[Produced by Mark the 45 King]

[Chorus: Dido]
My tea's gone cold
I'm wondering why I got out of bed at all
The morning rain clouds up my window
And I can't see at all
And even if I could it'd all be gray
But your picture on my wall
It reminds me that it's not so bad, it's not so bad
My tea's gone cold
I'm wondering why I got out of bed at all
The morning rain clouds up my window
And I can't see at all
And even if I could it'd all be gray
But your picture on my wall
It reminds me that it's not so bad, it's not so bad

[Verse 1: Eminem (as Stan)]
Dear Slim, I wrote you, but you still ain't callin'
I left my cell, my pager and my home phone at the bottom
I sent two letters back in autumn, you must not've got 'em
There probably was a problem at the post office or somethin'
Sometimes I scribble addresses too sloppy when I jot 'em
But anyways, fuck it, what's been up, man? How's your daughter?
My girlfriend's pregnant too, I'm 'bout to be a father
If I have a daughter, guess what I'ma call her?
I'ma name her Bonnie
I read about your Uncle Ronnie too, I'm sorry
I had a friend kill himself over some bitch who didn't want him
I know you probably hear this every day, but I'm your biggest fan
I even got the underground shit that you did with Skam
I got a room full of your posters and your pictures, man
I like the shit you did with Rawkus too, that shit was phat
Anyways, I hope you get this, man, hit me back
Just to chat, truly yours, your biggest fan, this is Stan

[Chorus: Dido]
My tea's gone cold
I'm wondering why I got out of bed at all
The morning rain clouds up my window
And I can't see at all
And even if I could it'd all be gray
But your picture on my wall
It reminds me that it's not so bad, it's not so bad

[Verse 2: Eminem (as Stan)]
Dear Slim, you still ain't called or wrote, I hope you have a chance
I ain't mad, I just think it's fucked up you don't answer fans
If you didn't want to talk to me outside your concert, you didn't have to
But you coulda signed an autograph for Matthew
That's my little brother, man, he's only six years old
We waited in the blisterin' cold
For you, for four hours, and you just said no
That's pretty shitty, man, you're like his fuckin' idol
He wants to be just like you, man, he likes you more than I do
I ain't that mad, though I just don't like bein' lied to
Remember when we met in Denver?
You said if I'd write you, you would write back
See, I'm just like you in a way: I never knew my father neither
He used to always cheat on my mom and beat her
I can relate to what you're sayin' in your songs
So when I have a shitty day, I drift away and put 'em on
'Cause I don't really got shit else
So that shit helps when I'm depressed
I even got a tattoo with your name across the chest
Sometimes I even cut myself to see how much it bleeds
It's like adrenaline, the pain is such a sudden rush for me
See, everything you say is real, and I respect you 'cause you tell it
My girlfriend's jealous 'cause I talk about you 24/7
But she don't know you like I know you, Slim, no one does
She don't know what it was like for people like us growin' up
You gotta call me, man, I'll be the biggest fan you'll ever lose
Sincerely yours, Stan'P.S.: We should be together too

[Chorus: Dido]
My tea's gone cold
I'm wondering why I got out of bed at all
The morning rain clouds up my window
And I can't see at all
And even if I could it'd all be gray
But your picture on my wall
It reminds me that it's not so bad, it's not so bad

[Verse 3: Eminem (as Stan)]
Dear Mr. I'm-Too-Good-to-Call-or-Write-My-Fans
This'll be the last package I ever send your ass
It's been six months, and still no word'I don't deserve it?
I know you got my last two letters
I wrote the addresses on 'em perfect
So this is my cassette I'm sendin' you, I hope you hear it
I'm in the car right now, I'm doin' 90 on the freeway
Hey, Slim, I drank a fifth of vodka, you dare me to drive?
You know the song by Phil Collins, "In the Air of the Night"
About that guy who coulda saved that other guy from drownin'
But didn't, then Phil saw it all, then at a show he found him?
That's kinda how this is: you coulda rescued me from drownin'
Now it's too late, I'm on a thousand downers now'I'm drowsy
And all I wanted was a lousy letter or a call
I hope you know I ripped all of your pictures off the wall
I loved you, Slim, we coulda been together'think about it!
You ruined it now, I hope you can't sleep and you dream about it
And when you dream I hope you can't sleep and you scream about it
I hope your conscience eats at you and you can't breathe without me
See, Slim'shut up, bitch! I'm tryin' to talk
Hey, Slim, that's my girlfriend screamin' in the trunk
But I didn't slit her throat, I just tied her up'See? I ain't like you
'Cause if she suffocates she'll suffer more and then she'll die too
Well, gotta go, I'm almost at the bridge now
Oh, shit, I forgot'how am I supposed to send this shit out?!

[Chorus: Dido]
My tea's gone cold
I'm wondering why I got out of bed at all
The morning rain clouds up my window
And I can't see at all
And even if I could it'd all be gray
But your picture on my wall
It reminds me that it's not so bad, it's not so bad

[Verse 4: Eminem]
Dear Stan, I meant to write you sooner, but I just been busy
You said your girlfriend's pregnant now, how far along is she?
Look, I'm really flattered you would call your daughter that
And here's an autograph
For your brother; I wrote it on a Starter cap
I'm sorry I didn't see you at the show, I must've missed you
Don't think I did that shit intentionally just to diss you
But what's this shit you said about you like to cut your wrists too?
I say that shit just clownin', dawg, come on, how fucked up is you?
You got some issues, Stan, I think you need some counselin'
To help your ass from bouncin'
Off the walls when you get down some
And what's this shit about us meant to be together?
That type of shit'll make me not want us to meet each other
I really think you and your girlfriend need each other
Or maybe you just need to treat her better
I hope you get to read this letter, I just hope it reaches you in time
Before you hurt yourself, I think that you'll be doin' just fine
If you relax a little, I'm glad I inspire you, but Stan
Why are you so mad? Try to understand
That I do want you as a fan
I just don't want you to do some crazy shit
I seen this one shit on the news a couple weeks ago that made me sick
Some dude was drunk and drove his car over a bridge
And had his girlfriend in the trunk
And she was pregnant with his kid
And in the car they found a tape, but they didn't say who it was to
Come to think about it, his name was'it was you, damn'

[Intro]
May I have your attention, please?
May I have your attention, please?
Will the real Slim Shady please stand up?
I repeat, will the real Slim Shady please stand up?
We're gonna have a problem here...

[Verse 1]
Y'all act like you never seen a white person before
Jaws all on the floor like Pam like Tommy just burst in the door
And started whoopin' her ass worse than before
They first were divorced, suin' her over furniture (Agh!)
It's the return of the "Ah, wait, no way, you're kidding
He didn't just say what I think he did, did he?"
And Dr. Dre said' nothing, you idiots!
Dr. Dre's dead, he's locked in my basement (ha ha!)
Feminist women love Eminem
"Chicka, chicka, chicka, Slim Shady, I'm sick of him
Look at him, walkin' around, grabbin' his you-know-what
Flippin' the you-know-who," "Yeah, but he's so cute though."
Yeah, I probably got a couple of screws up in my head loose
But no worse than what's goin' on in your parents' bedrooms
Sometimes I wanna get on TV and just let loose
But can't, but it's cool for Tom Green to hump a dead moose
"My bum is on your lips, my bum is on your lips"
And if I'm lucky, you might just give it a little kiss
And that's the message that we deliver to little kids
And expect them not to know what a woman's clitoris is
Of course, they're gonna know what intercourse is
By the time they hit fourth grade
They've got the Discovery Channel, don't they?
We ain't nothin' but mammals'well, some of us, cannibals
Who cut other people open like cantaloupes
But if we can hump dead animals and antelopes
Then there's no reason that a man and another man can't elope
But if you feel like I feel, I got the antidote
Women, wave your pantyhose, sing the chorus, and it goes'

[Chorus]
I'm Slim Shady, yes I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up?
'Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up?

[Verse 2]
Will Smith don't gotta cuss in his raps to sell records (Nope)
Well, I do, so fuck him and fuck you too!
You think I give a damn about a Grammy?
Half of you critics can't even stomach me, let alone stand me
"But Slim, what if you win, wouldn't it be weird?"
Why, so you guys could just lie to get me here?
So you can sit me here next to Britney Spears?
Shit, Christina Aguilera better switch me chairs
So I can sit next to Carson Daly and Fred Durst
And hear 'em argue over who she gave head to first
Little bitch put me on blast on MTV
"Yeah, he's cute, but I think he's married to Kim, hee-hee."
I should download her audio on MP3
And show the whole world how you gave Eminem VD (Agh!)
I'm sick of you little girl and boy groups
All you do is annoy me, so I have been sent here to destroy you
And there's a million of us just like me
Who cuss like me, who just don't give a fuck like me
Who dress like me; walk, talk and act like me
And just might be the next best thing, but not quite me

[Chorus]
'Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up?
'Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up?

[Verse 3]
I'm like a head trip to listen to, 'cause I'm only givin' you
Things you joke about with your friends inside your livin' room
The only difference is I got the balls to say it in front of y'all
And I don't gotta be false or sugarcoat it at all
I just get on the mic and spit it
And whether you like to admit it, I just shit it
Better than 90% of you rappers out can
Then you wonder: "How can
Kids eat up these albums like Valiums?"
It's funny, 'cause at the rate, I'm going, when I'm 30
I'll be the only person in the nursing home flirting
Pinching nurse's asses when I'm jacking off with Jergens
And I'm jerking, but this whole bag of Viagra isn't working
And every single person is a Slim Shady lurking
He could be working at Burger King, spittin' on your onion rings
Or in the parking lot, circling, screaming, "I don't give a fuck!"
With his windows down and his system up
So will the real Shady please stand up
And put one of those fingers on each hand up?
And be proud to be outta your mind and outta control
And one more time, loud as you can, how does it go?

[Chorus]
I'm Slim Shady, yes I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up?
'Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up?
'Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up?
'Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up?

[Outro]
Ha ha, I guess there's a Slim Shady in all of us
Fuck it, let's all stand up!

[Produced by Dr. Dre & Mel-Man]

[Chorus: Beyonc' & Eminem]
I walk on water
But I ain't no Jesus
I walk on water
But only when it freezes (Fuck)

[Verse 1: Eminem]
Why are expectations so high? Is it the bar I set?
My arms, I stretch, but I can't reach
A far cry from it, or it's in my grasp, but as
Soon as I grab, squeeze
I lose my grip like the flying trapeze
Into the dark I plummet, now the sky's blackening
I know the mark's high, butter'
flies rip apart my stomach
Knowin' that no matter what bars I come with
You're gonna harp, gripe, and
That's a hard Vicodin to swallow, so I scrap these
As pressure increases like khakis
I feel the ice cracking, because'

[Chorus: Beyonc' & Eminem]
I walk on water
But I ain't no Jesus
(It's the curse of the', it's the curse of the')
I walk on water (Shit)
But only when it freezes

[Verse 2: Eminem]
It's the curse of the standard, that the first of the Mathers disc set
Always in search of the verse that I haven't spit yet
Will this step just be another misstep
To tarnish whatever the legacy, love or respect
I've garnered? The rhyme has to be perfect, the delivery flawless
And it always feels like I'm hittin' the mark
'Til I go sit in the car, listen and pick it apart
Like, "This shit is garbage!"
God's given me all this, still I feel no different regardless
Kids look to me as a god, this is retarded
If only they knew, it's a facade and it's exhaustive
And I try not to listen to nonsense
But if you bitches are tryin' to strip me of my confidence
Mission accomplished
I'm not God-sent, Nas, Rakim, 'Pac, B.I.G., James Todd Smith
And I'm not Prince, so'

[Chorus: Beyonc' & Eminem]
I walk on water
But I ain't no Jesus
I walk on water
(It's true, I'm a Rubik's', it's true')
But only when it freezes
(It's true')

[Post-Chorus: Beyonc']
'Cause I'm only human, just like you
Making my mistakes, oh if you only knew
I don't think you should believe in me the way that you do
'Cause I'm terrified to let you down, oh

[Verse 3: Eminem]
It's true, I'm a Rubik's'a beautiful mess
At times juvenile, yes, I goof and I jest
A flawed human, I guess
But I'm doin' my best to not ruin your ex'
pectations and meet 'em, but first
The "Speedom" verse, now Big Sean
He's goin' too fast, is he gonna shout or curse out his mom?
There was a time I had the world by the balls, eatin' out my palm
Every album song I was spazzin' the fuck out on
And now I'm gettin' clowned and frowned on
But the only one who's looking down on
Me that matters now's DeShaun
Am I lucky to be around this long?
Begs the question though
Especially after the methadone
As yesterday fades and the Dresden home
Is burnt to the ground and all that's left of my house is lawn
The crowds are gone
And it's time to wash out the blonde
Sales decline, the curtain's drawn
They're closin' the set, I'm still pokin' my head from out behind
And everyone who has doubt, remind
Now take your best rhyme, outdo it, now do it a thousand times
Now let 'em tell ya the world no longer cares
Or gives a fuck about your rhymes
And as I grow outta site, outta mind, I might go outta mine
'Cause how do I ever let this mic go without a fight
When I made a fuckin' tightrope outta twine?
But when I do fall from these heights though, I'll be fine
I won't pout or cry or spiral down or whine
But I'll decide if it's my final bow this time around, 'cause'

[Chorus: Beyonc']
I walk on water
But I ain't no Jesus
I walk on water
But only when it freezes

[Post-Chorus: Beyonc']
'Cause I'm only human, just like you
I've been making my mistakes, oh if you only knew
I don't think you should believe in me the way that you do
'Cause I'm terrified to let you down, oh
If I walked on water, I would drown

[Outro: Eminem]
'Cause I'm just a man
But as long as I got a mic, I'm godlike
So me and you are not alike
Bitch, I wrote "Stan"

[Intro]
(Fack) Okay, (Fack) how do I say this? (Fack)
Last year (Fack) didn't work out so well for me (Fack)
(Fack last year!) (Fack) (Last year can eat a dick!)
2018, (Fack) well (Fack)

[Verse 1]
Hah, yeah, I'm a fuckin' kamikaze crashin' into everything
You beat me, Islamic Nazi, that means there is no such thing
I've been goin' for your jugular since Craig G "Duck Alert"
Wedgie in my underwear, the whole bed sheet and the comforter
Stuck up in my rectal crack, kiss my disrespectful ass
I'll ride through your cul-de-sac
Window cracked, bumpin' your reference tracks
Y-You collaborative effort rap, I-I have never said his raps
O-Overstayed my welcome, stepped in crap
And ruined your welcome mat
So spit that shit from the heart, you didn't write like you wrote it (Wrote it) (Yeah)
While I teabag the microphone 'cause I go nuts on it (On it) (Yeah)
Like a fighter jet lined with explosives that'll strike any moment
Headed right at opponents and I'm the fuckin' pilot that flown it
I'm 'bout to'

[Chorus]
Smash into everyone, crash into everything
Back and I've just begun, "FACK" 2017
Fack, fack on everyone
Fack, fack on everyone
Fack, fack on everyone
I'm a Kamikaze, gonna
Smash into everyone, crash like an F-15
Damage already done, y'all shoulda let me be
Fack, fack on everyone
Fack, fack on everyone
Fack, fack on everyone
I'm a Kamikaze, gonna

[Verse 2]
I turned to rap 'cause it made me feel tough when I wasn't (Wasn't)
From the moment I heard rappers cussin', I was in (Was in)
Which is why I identify with the guy
Who I was invented by, Dre's Frankenstein
Energized like a nine volt
Ice cold like Snake Eyes, twice in a row on a dice roll
But if the only reason I blowed is 'cause I'm white though
Why don't every other white rapper sell what I sold? (Ooh)
Kamikaze pilot, I wrote my suicide note
Here come the guys in white coats tryin' to stop me
'Fore I jump behind the controls and try to fly into foes
'Cause I'm takin' y'all with me when I go cyclone
I don't think this typhoon's letting up any time soon, here I go
Eyes closed, blindfolded, I'm 'bout to'

[Chorus]
Smash into everyone, crash into everything
Back and I've just begun, "FACK" 2017
Fack, fack on everyone
Fack, fack on everyone
Fack, fack on everyone
I'm a Kamikaze, gonna
Smash into everyone, crash like an F-15
Damage already done, y'all should'a let me be
Fack, fack on everyone
Fack, fack on everyone
Fack, fack on everyone
I'm a Kamikaze, gonna

[Bridge]
Smash
Kamikaze, kamikaze
Kami, kami-kamikaze, kamikaze, kami-kamikaze (kamikaze)
Take a look at what I've done

[Verse 3]
I heard your freestyle on Shade 45, that shit was embarrassing
There is no way we ever air that shit again, I guarantee that
Wait, that shit was so ass it's somethin' we wouldn't dare re-air it
The shit's embarrassing as me rear-ending Tara Reid bare
In my therapy chair, my dick is the hair length of Cher
Each nut is the chair width of an Acorn stairlift, beware of me
Lyrically I'm terrible, better get your lyrics prepared
Richard Ramirez is here, serial killin' every beat there is
Wait, wait, got the eeriest feelin'
Somethin' evil is lurkin', I'm no conspiracy theorist
But somethin' here is a foot'oh yeah, it's my dick
Get the measurin' stick (What?), 12 inches of wood (Haha)
Wait, but I've been goin' for your jugular since Craig G "Duck Alert"
And I've come to pay respects
'Cause if you sleep you're fucked'other words
You get laid to rest and I hope your butt is hurt
Put me on a track, I go cray-on it like a color book
You got some views, but you're still below me
Mine are higher, so when you compare our views, you get overlooked
And I don't say the hook unless I wrote the hook
And now I'm just freestylin' in the vocal booth
And you know I've always spoke the truth
You're lyin' through your teeth so much you broke a tooth
And it ain't somethin' I need a phone to do
When I say I can't wait 'til I get ahold of you
And I don't know what I'm s'posed to do
Line up the rappers, take my pic like a photo shoot

[Intro: Eminem]
'Cause sometimes you just feel tired, feel weak
(Yo left, yo left, yo left, right, left)
And when you feel weak (Yo left)
You feel like you wanna just give up (Yo left, yo left)
But you gotta search within you (Right, left)
Try to find that inner strength (Yo left, yo left)
And just pull that shit out of you (Yo left)
And get that motivation to not give up (Right, left, yo left)
And not be a quitter, no matter how bad you wanna just fall
(Yo left, yo left, right, left)
Flat on your face and collapse

[Verse 1: Eminem]
'Til I collapse I'm spillin' these raps long as you feel 'em
'Til the day that I drop you'll never say that I'm not killin' 'em
'Cause when I am not, then I'ma stop pennin' 'em
And I am not hip-hop and I'm just not Eminem
Subliminal thoughts, when I'ma stop sendin' 'em?
Women are caught in webs, spin 'em and hock venom
Adrenaline shots of penicillin could not get the illin' to stop
Amoxicillin's just not real enough
The criminal, cop-killin', hip-hop villain
A minimal swap to cop millions of Pac listeners
You're comin' with me, feel it or not
You're gonna fear it like I showed you the spirit of God lives in us
You hear it a lot, lyrics to shock
Is it a miracle or am I just product of pop fizzin' up?
Fo' shizzle, my wizzle, this is the plot, listen up
You bizzles forgot, Slizzle does not give a fuck

[Chorus: Nate Dogg]
'Til the roof comes off, 'til the lights go out
'Til my legs give out, can't shut my mouth
'Til the smoke clears out, am I high? Perhaps
I'ma rip this shit 'til my bones collapse
(Until the roof) 'Til the roof comes off, 'til the lights go out
(The roof comes off) 'Til my legs give out, can't shut my mouth
(Until my legs) 'Til the smoke clears out, am I high? Perhaps
(Give out from underneath me) I'ma rip this shit 'til my bones collapse

[Verse 2: Eminem]
Music is like magic, there's a certain feelin' you get
When you real and you spit, and people are feelin' your shit
This is your moment, and every single minute you spend
Tryna hold on to it 'cause you may never get it again
So while you're in it, try to get as much shit as you can
And when your run is over, just admit when it's at its end
'Cause I'm at the end of my wits with half the shit that gets in
I got a list, here's the order of my list that it's in
It goes Reggie, Jay-Z, 2Pac and Biggie
Andr' from OutKast, Jada, Kurupt, Nas, and then me
But in this industry I'm the cause of a lot of envy
So when I'm not put on this list, the shit does not offend me
That's why you see me walk around like nothing's botherin' me
Even though half you people got a fuckin' problem with me
You hate it, but you know respect you got to give me
The press's wet dream, like Bobby and Whitney ' Nate, hit me!

[Chorus: Nate Dogg]
'Til the roof comes off, 'til the lights go out
'Til my legs give out, can't shut my mouth
'Til the smoke clears out, am I high? Perhaps
I'ma rip this shit 'til my bones collapse
(Until the roof) 'Til the roof comes off, 'til the lights go out
(The roof comes off) 'Til my legs give out, can't shut my mouth
(Until my legs) 'Til the smoke clears out, am I high? Perhaps
(Give out from underneath me) I'ma rip this shit 'til my bones collapse

[Verse 3: Eminem]
Soon as a verse starts, I eat at an MC's heart
What is he thinking? How not to go against me, smart
And it's absurd how people hang on every word
I'll prob'ly never get the props I feel I ever deserve
But I'll never be served, my spot is forever reserved
If I ever leave Earth, that would be the death of me first
'Cause in my heart of hearts I know nothin' could ever be worse
That's why I'm clever when I put together every verse
My thoughts are sporadic, I act like I'm an addict
I rap like I'm addicted to smack like I'm Kim Mathers
But I don't wanna go forth and back in constant battles
The fact is I would rather sit back and bomb some rappers
So this is like a full-blown attack I'm launchin' at 'em
The track is on some battlin' raps, who wants some static?
'Cause I don't really think that the fact that I'm Slim matters
A plaque and platinum status is whack if I'm not the baddest, so

[Chorus: Nate Dogg]
'Til the roof comes off, 'til the lights go out
'Til my legs give out, can't shut my mouth
'Til the smoke clears out, am I high? Perhaps
I'ma rip this shit 'til my bones collapse
(Until the roof) 'Til the roof comes off, 'til the lights go out
(The roof comes off) 'Til my legs give out, can't shut my mouth
(Until my legs) 'Til the smoke clears out, am I high? Perhaps
(Give out from underneath me) I'ma rip this shit 'til my bones collapse

[Outro: Eminem & (Nate Dogg)]
Until the roof (Until the roof)
The roof comes off (The roof comes off)
Until my legs (Until my legs)
Give out from (Underneath me)
I, I will not fall, I will stand tall
Feels like no one can beat me

[Verse 1]
It's like I'm in this dirt, digging up old hurt
Tried everything to get my mind off you, it won't work
All it takes is one song on the radio, you're
Right back on it, reminding me all over again
How you fucking just brushed me off and left me so burnt
Spent a lot of time tryin' to soul search
Maybe I needed to grow up a little first
Well, looks like I hit a growth spurt
But I'm coming for closure
Don't suppose an explanation I'm owed, for
The way that you turned your back on me
Just when I may have needed you most
Oh, you thought it was over? You could just close the
Chapter and go about your life like it was nothing?
You ruined mine, but you seem to be doin' fine
Well, I've never recovered
But tonight I bet you that what you're
'Bout to go through's tougher than anything I ever have suffered
Can't think of a better way to define poetic justice
Can I hold grudges? Mind saying, "Let it go, fuck this."
Heart's saying, "I will, once I bury this bitch alive
Hide the shovel and then drive off in the sunset."

[Chorus: Sarah Jaffe]
I flee the scene like it was my last ride
You see right through
Oh, you had me pegged the first time
You can see the truth, but it's easier to justify
What's bad is good and I hate to be the bad guy
I just hate to be the bad guy
(Follow me, I ruh-uh-un; follow me, I ruh-uh-un)
I just hate to be the bad guy
(Follow me, I ruh-uh-un; follow me, I ruh-uh-un)

[Verse 2]
And to think I used to think you was the shit, bitch
To think it was you at one time I worshipped, shit
Think you can hurt people and just keep getting away with it?
Not this time, you better go and get the sewing kit, bitch!
Finish this stitch, so you can reap what you sew, nitwit
Thought some time would pass and I'd forget it? Forget it!
You left our family in shambles
And you expect me to just get over him, pretend he never existed?
May be gone but he's not forgotten
And don't think 'cause he's been out the pictures
So long that I've stopped the plottin' and still ain't comin' to get ya
You're wrong and that shit was rotten
And the way you played him, same shit you did to me, cold
Have you any idea the shit that I've gone through?
Feelings I harbor? All this pent-up resentment I hold on to?
Not once you call to ask me how I'm doin'
Letters, you don't respond to 'em
Fuck it, I'm coming to see you
And, gee, who better to talk to than you?
The cause of my problems
My life is garbage, and I'm 'bout to take it out on you
Poof, then I'm gone, voosh

[Chorus: Sarah Jaffe]
I flee the scene like it was my last ride
You see right through
Oh, you had me pegged the first time
You can see the truth, but it's easier to justify
What's bad is good and I hate to be the bad guy
I just hate to be the bad guy
(Follow me, I ruh-uh-un; follow me, I ruh-uh-un)
I just hate to be the bad guy
(Follow me, I ruh-uh-un; follow me, I ruh-uh-un)

[Verse 3]
I've been drivin' around your side of this town
Like 9 frickin' hours and 45 minutes now
Finally I found your new address, park in your drive
Feel like I've been waiting on this moment all of my life
And it's now arrived, and my mouth is full of saliva
My knife is out and I'm ducking on the side of your house
See, it's sad it came to this point
Such a disappointment I had to make this appointment
To come and see ya, but I ain't here for your empathy
I don't need your apology or your friendship or sympathy
It's revenge that I seek
So I sneak vengefully, and treat your bedroom window
Like I reached my full potential: I peeked
Continue to peep, still bent low, then keep
Tapping the glass lightly then start to crescendo, sneak
All the way 'round to the back porch
Man, door handles unlocked, shouldn't be that easy to do this
You don't plan for intruders beforehand?
Surprised to see me? Cat caught your tongue?
Gag, chloroform rag, dag, almost hack-up a lung
Like you picked an axe up and swung, stick to the core plan
Dragged to the back of a trunk by one of your fans
Irony's spectacular, huh? Now who's a faggot, you punk?
And here's your Bronco hat
You can have that shit back 'cause they suck
It's just me, you and the music now, Slim, I hope you hear it
We're in the car right now ' wait, here comes my favorite lyric
"I'm the bad guy who makes fun of people that die"
And hey, here's a sequel to my
Mathers LP just to try to get people to buy
How's this for a publicity stunt? This should be fun!
Last album now, 'cause after this you'll be officially done
Eminem killed by M and M, Matthew Mitchell
Bitch, I even have your initials
I initially was gonna bury you next to my brother, but fuck it
Since you're in love with your city so much, I figured, what the fuck
The best place you could be buried alive is right here
Two more exits, time is quite near
Hope we don't get stopped, no license I fear
That sirens I hear? Guess 90 on the freeway wasn't the brightest idea, as cops appear in my driver's side mirror
(Oh, God! Police! Aaaghh!)
Hope Foxtrot gets an aerial shot of your burial plot, at least
New plan, Stan!
Slim: "Chauvinist pig drove in this big Lincoln Town Car"
Well, gotta go, almost at the bridge
Ha ha, big bro, it's for you; Slim, this is for him
And Frank Ocean; oh, hope you can swim good
Now say you hate homos again!

[Verse 4]
I also represent
Anyone on the receiving end of those jokes you offend
I'm the nightmare you fell asleep and then woke up still in
I'm your karma closing in with each stroke of a pen
Perfect time to have some remorse to show for your sin
Nope, it's hopeless, I'm the denial that you're hopelessly in
When they say all of this is approachin' its end
But you refuse to believe that it's over, here we go all over again
Back's to the wall, I'm stacking up all them odds
Toilets clogged, yeah, 'cause I'm talking a lot of
Shit but I'm backing it all up
But in my head there's a voice in the back and it hollers
After the track is demolished, I am your lack of a conscience
I'm the ringing in your ears
I'm the polyps on the back of your tonsils
Eatin' your vocal chords after your concerts
I'm your time that's almost up that you haven't acknowledged
Grab for some water
But I'm that pill that's too jagged to swallow
I'm the bullies you hate that you became
With every faggot you slaughtered
Coming back on you, every woman you insult
Batter, but the double-standards you have
When it comes to your daughters
I represent everything you take for granted
'Cause Marshall Mathers, the rapper's persona
Is half a facade, and Matthew and Stan's just symbolic
Of you not knowing what you had 'til it's gone
'Cause after all the glitz and the glam
No more fans that are calling your name
Cameras are off, sad, but it happens to all of them
I'm the hindsight to say, 'I told you so!'
Foreshadows of all the things that are to follow
I'm the future that's here to show you what happens tomorrow
If you don't stop after they call ya
Biggest laughing stock of rap who can't call it quits
When it's time to walk away, I'm every guilt trip
The baggage you have, but as you gather up all your possessions
If there's anything you have left to say
'Less it makes an impact, then don't bother
So 'fore you rest your case
Better make sure you're packin' a wallop
So, one last time, I'm back
Before it fades into black and it's all over
Behold the final chapter in a saga
Tryin' to recapture that lightning trapped in a bottle
Twice, the magic that started
It all, tragic portrait of an artist
Tortured, trapped in his own drawings
Tap into thoughts blacker and darker
Than anything imaginable; here goes a wild stab in the dark
As we pick up where the last Mathers left off

[Chorus: Rihanna]
Just gonna stand there and watch me burn?
Well, that's all right because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry?
Well, that's all right because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie

[Verse 1: Eminem]
I can't tell you what it really is, I can only tell you what it feels like
And right now, there's a steel knife in my windpipe
I can't breathe, but I still fight while I can fight
As long as the wrong feels right, it's like I'm in flight
High off her love, drunk from her hate
It's like I'm huffin' paint and I love her, the more I suffer, I suffocate
And right before I'm about to drown, she resuscitates
Me, she fuckin' hates me, and I love it ' "Wait!
Where you going?" ' "I'm leaving you!" ' "No, you ain't!
Come back!" ' We're runnin' right back, here we go again
It's so insane, 'cause when it's goin' good, it's goin' great
I'm Superman with the wind at his back, she's Lois Lane
But when it's bad, it's awful, I feel so ashamed
I snapped, "Who's that dude?", I don't even know his name
I laid hands on her, I'll never stoop so low again
I guess I don't know my own strength

[Chorus: Rihanna]
Just gonna stand there and watch me burn?
Well, that's all right because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry?
Well, that's all right because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie

[Verse 2: Eminem]
You ever love somebody so much you can barely breathe when you're with 'em?
You meet, and neither one of you even know what hit 'em
Got that warm fuzzy feelin', yeah, them chills, used to get 'em
Now you're gettin' fuckin' sick of lookin' at 'em?
You swore you'd never hit 'em, never do nothin' to hurt 'em
Now you're in each other's face spewin' venom in your words when you spit 'em
You push, pull each other's hair, scratch, claw, bit 'em
Throw 'em down, pin 'em, so lost in the moments when you're in 'em
It's the rage that took over, it controls you both
So they say you're best to go your separate ways, guess that they don't know ya
'Cause today, that was yesterday, yesterday is over
It's a different day, sound like broken records playin' over
But you promised her, next time you'll show restraint
You don't get another chance, life is no Nintendo game, but you lied again
Now you get to watch her leave out the window
Guess that's why they call it window pane

[Chorus: Rihanna]
Just gonna stand there and watch me burn?
Well, that's all right because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry?
Well, that's all right because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie

[Verse 3: Eminem]
Now, I know we said things, did things that we didn't mean
Then we fall back into the same patterns, same routine
But your temper's just as bad as mine is, you're the same as me
When it comes to love you're just as blinded, baby, please
Come back, it wasn't you, baby, it was me
Maybe our relationship isn't as crazy as it seems
Maybe that's what happens when a tornado meets a volcano
All I know is I love you too much to walk away though
Come inside, pick up your bags off the sidewalk
Don't you hear sincerity in my voice when I talk?
Told you this is my fault, look me in the eyeball
Next time I'm pissed, I'll aim my fist at the drywall
Next time? There won't be no next time!
I apologize, even though I know it's lies
I'm tired of the games, I just want her back, I know I'm a liar
If she ever tries to fuckin' leave again, I'ma tie her
To the bed and set this house on fire, just gonna

[Chorus: Rihanna]
Just gonna stand there and watch me burn?
Well, that's all right because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry?
Well, that's all right because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie

[B-Rabbit (Eminem)]
Now, everybody from the 313
Put your motherfucking hands up and follow me!
Everybody from the 313
Put your motherfucking hands up! Look, look...
Now, while he stands tough
Notice that this man did not have his hands up
This Free World's got you gassed up
Now, who's afraid of the Big Bad Wolf?
One, two, three, and to the four
One Pac, two Pac, three Pac, four
Four Pac, three Pac, two Pac, one
You're Pac, he's Pac, no Pac, none
This guy ain't no motherfucking MC
I know everything he's 'bout to say against me
I am white, I am a fucking bum
I do live in a trailer with my mom
My boy Future is an Uncle Tom
I do got a dumb friend named Cheddar Bob
Who shoots himself in his leg with his own gun
I did get jumped by all six of you chumps
And Wink did fuck my girl
I'm still standing here screaming, "Fuck the Free World!"
Don't ever try to judge me, dude
You don't know what the fuck I've been through
But I know something about you
You went to Cranbrook, that's a private school
What's the matter, dawg? You embarrassed?
This guy's a gangster? His real name's Clarence
And Clarence lives at home with both parents
And Clarence parents have a real good marriage
This guy don't wanna battle, he's shook
'Cause ain't no such things as halfway crooks
He's scared to death, he's scared to look
At his fucking yearbook; fuck Cranbrook!
Fuck a beat, I'll go a cappella
Fuck a Papa Doc, fuck a clock, fuck a trailer
Fuck everybody! Fuck y'all if you doubt me!
I'm a piece of fucking white trash, I say it proudly
And fuck this battle, I don't wanna win, I'm outtie
Here, tell these people something they don't know about me

[Papa Doc (Anthony Mackie)]
Yo...

[Intro]
Yeah, I know sometimes things may not always make sense to you right now. But hey, what'd Daddy always tell you? Straighten up, little soldier, stiffen up that upper lip! What you cryin' about? You got me

[Verse 1]
Hailie, I know you miss your mom, and I know you miss your dad
When I'm gone, but I'm tryin' to give you the life that I never had
I can see you're sad, even when you smile, even when you laugh
I can see it in your eyes, deep inside you wanna cry
'Cause you're scared, I ain't there
Daddy's with you in your prayers
No more cryin', wipe them tears
Daddy's here, no more nightmares
We gon' pull together through it
We gon' do it, Lainie'Uncle's crazy, ain't he?
Yeah, but he loves you, girl, and you better know it
We're all we got in this world, when it spins, when it swirls
When it whirls, when it twirls, two little beautiful girls
Lookin' puzzled, in a daze, I know it's confusin' you
Daddy's always on the move, Momma's always on the news
I try to keep you sheltered from it, but somehow it seems
The harder that I try to do that, the more it backfires on me
All the things growin' up as Daddy that he had to see
Daddy don't want you to see, but you see just as much as he did
We did not plan it to be this way, your mother and me
But things have got so bad between us, I don't see us ever bein'
Together ever again, like we used to be when we was teenagers
But then, of course, everything always happens for a reason
I guess it was never meant to be, but it's just something
We have no control over, and that's what destiny is
But no more worries, rest your head and go to sleep
Maybe one day we'll wake up and this'll all just be a dream

[Hook]
Now hush, little baby, don't you cry
Everything's gonna be alright
Stiffen that upper lip up, little lady, I told ya
Daddy's here to hold ya through the night
I know Mommy's not here right now, and we don't know why
We fear how we feel inside
It may seem a little crazy, pretty baby
But I promise, Momma's gon' be alright (heh)

[Verse 2]
It's funny, I remember back one year when Daddy had no money
Mommy wrapped the Christmas presents up and stuck 'em under the tree
And said some of 'em were from me 'cause Daddy couldn't buy 'em
I'll never forget that Christmas, I sat up the whole night cryin'
'Cause Daddy felt like a bum'see, Daddy had a job
But his job was to keep the food on the table for you and Mom
And at the time, every house that we lived in
Either kept gettin' broken into and robbed or shot up on the block
And your mom was savin' money for you in a jar
Tryin' to start a piggy bank for you so you could go to college
Almost had a thousand dollars, 'til someone broke in and stole it
And I know it hurt so bad it broke your momma's heart
And it seemed like everything was just startin' to fall apart
Mom and Dad was arguin' a lot, so Momma moved back
On to Chalmers in the flat, one bedroom apartment
And Dad moved back to the other side of 8 Mile on Novara
And that's when Daddy went to California with his CD
And met Dr. Dre and flew you and Momma out to see me
But Daddy had to work, you and Momma had to leave me
Then you started seein' Daddy on the TV, and Momma didn't like it
And you and Lainie were too young to understand it
Papa was a rolling stone, Momma developed a habit
And it all happened too fast for either one of us to grab it
I'm just sorry you were there and had to witness it first hand
'Cause all I ever wanted to do was just make you proud
Now I'm sittin' in this empty house
Just reminiscin', lookin' at your baby pictures, it just trips me out
To see how much you both have grown, it's almost like you're sisters now
Wow, guess you pretty much are, and Daddy's still here
Lainie, I'm talkin' to you too, Daddy's still here
I like the sound of that, yeah, it's got a ring to it, don't it?
Sshh! Momma's only gone for the moment

[Hook]
Now hush, little baby, don't you cry
Everything's gonna be alright
Stiffen that upper lip up, little lady, I told ya
Daddy's here to hold ya through the night
I know Mommy's not here right now, and we don't know why
We fear how we feel inside
It may seem a little crazy, pretty baby
But I promise, Momma's gon' be alright

[Hook 2]
And if you ask me to, Daddy's gonna buy you a mockingbird
I'ma give you the world
I'ma buy a diamond ring for you, I'ma sing for you
I'll do anything for you to see you smile
And if that mockingbird don't sing and that ring don't shine
I'ma break that birdie's neck
I'll go back to the jeweler who sold it to ya
And make him eat every carat, don't fuck with Dad! (Ha-ha!)

[Produced by Emile Haynie & Jeff Bhasker]

[Intro: Nate Ruess]
Mom, I know I let you down
And though you say the days are happy
Why is the power off and I'm fucked up?
And, Mom, I know he's not around
But don't you place the blame on me
As you pour yourself another drink, yeah

[Chorus: Nate Ruess]
I guess we are who we are
Headlights shining in the dark night, I drive on
Maybe we took this too far

[Verse 1: Eminem]
I went in headfirst, never thinkin' about who what I said hurt
In what verse, my mom probably got it the worst
The brunt of it, but as stubborn as we are, did I take it too far?
"Cleanin' Out My Closet" and all them other songs
But regardless, I don't hate you 'cause, Ma
You're still beautiful to me, 'cause you're my mom
Though far be it from you to be calm
Our house was Vietnam, Desert Storm
And both of us put together could form an atomic bomb
Equivalent to chemical warfare
And forever we could drag this on and on
But agree to disagree, that gift for me
Up under the Christmas tree don't mean shit to me
You're kickin' me out? It's 15 degrees
And it's Christmas Eve, "Little prick, just leave!"
Ma, let me grab my fucking coat!
Anything to have each other's goats
Why we always at each other's throats?
Especially when Dad, he fucked us both
We're in the same fuckin' boat
You'd think that'd make us close (Nope)
Further away it drove us, but together, headlights shine
And a car full of belongings, still got a ways to go
Back to grandma's house, it's straight up the road
And I was the man of the house, the oldest
So my shoulders carried the weight of the load
Then Nate got taken away by the state at eight years old
And that's when I realized you were sick
And it wasn't fixable or changeable
And to this day we remain estranged, and I hate it though, but'

[Chorus: Nate Ruess]
I guess we are who we are
Headlights shining in the dark night, I drive on
Maybe we took this too far

[Verse 2: Eminem]
'Cause to this day we remain estranged, and I hate it though
'Cause you ain't even get to witness your grandbabies grow
But I'm sorry, Momma, for "Cleanin' Out My Closet"
At the time I was angry, rightfully? Maybe so
Never meant that far to take it though
'Cause now I know it's not your fault, and I'm not makin' jokes
That song I no longer play at shows
And I cringe every time it's on the radio
And I think of Nathan being placed in a home
And all the medicine you fed us and
How I just wanted you to taste your own
But now the medication's takin' over
And your mental state's deterioratin' slow
And I'm way too old to cry, this shit is painful though
But, Ma, I forgive you, so does Nathan, yo
All you did, all you said, you did your best to raise us both
Foster care, that cross you bear, few may be as heavy as yours
But I love you, Debbie Mathers
Oh, what a tangled web we have 'cause
One thing I never asked was
Where the fuck my deadbeat dad was
Fuck it, I guess he had trouble keepin' up with every address
But I'da flipped every mattress, every rock and desert cactus
Owned a collection of maps
And followed my kids to the edge of the atlas
If someone ever moved 'em from me
That you coulda bet your asses
If I had to come down the chimney, dressed as Santa, kidnap 'em
And although one has only met their grandma once
You pulled up in our drive one night
As we were leavin' to get some hamburgers
Me, her and Nate, we introduced you, hugged you
And as you left I had this overwhelming sadness
Come over me as we pulled off to go our separate paths and
I saw your headlights as I looked back
And I'm mad I didn't get the chance to
Thank you for being my mom and my dad
So, Mom, please accept this as a
Tribute; I wrote this on the jet, I guess I had to
Get this off my chest, I hope I get the chance to
Lay it 'fore I'm dead, the stewardess said to fasten
My seatbelt, I guess we're crashin'
So, if I'm not dreamin', I hope you get this message that
I will always love you from afar, 'cause you're my mom

[Chorus: Nate Ruess]
I guess we are who we are
Headlights shining in the dark night, I drive on
Maybe we took this too far

[Bridge: Nate Ruess & Eminem]
I want a new life (Start over)
One without a cause (Clean slate)
So I'm coming home tonight (Yeah)
Well, no matter what the cost
And if the plane goes down
Or if the crew can't wake me up
Well, just know that I'm alright
I was not afraid to die
Oh, even if there's songs to sing
Well, my children will carry me
Just know that I'm alright
I was not afraid to die
Because I put my faith in my little girls
So I'll never say goodbye cruel world
Just know that I'm alright
I am not afraid to die

[Chorus: Nate Ruess]
I guess we are who we are
Headlights shining in the dark night, I drive on
Maybe we took this too far
I want a new life

[Chorus: Liz Rodrigues]
This is survival of the fittest
This is do or die
This is the winner takes it all
So, take it all, a-all, a-all, a-all

[Verse 1: Eminem]
Wasn't ready to be no millionaire, I was ill-prepared
I was prepared to be ill though, the skill was there
From the beginning it wasn't 'bout the ends, it was 'bout
Bustin' raps and standin' for somethin', fuck an acronym
Cut the fuckin' act like you're happy, I'm fuckin' back again
With another anthem ' why stop when it doesn't have to end?
It ain't over 'til I say it's over, enough when I say enough
Throw me to them wolves and close the gate up, I'm afraid of What'll happen to them wolves when the thought of being thrown
Into an alligator pit, I salivate at it, wait is up
Hands up like it's 12 noon, nah, homie, hold them bitches straighter up
Wave 'em 'til you dislocate a rotator cuff
Came up rough, came to ruffle feathers, nah, egos, I ain't deflate enough
Last chance to make this whole stadium erupt, 'cause'

[Chorus: Liz Rodrigues]
This is survival of the fittest
This is do or die
This is the winner takes it all
So, take it all, a-all, a-all, a-all

[Verse 2: Eminem]
I can see the finish line with each line that I finish
I'm so close to my goals, I can almost pole vault over the goal post
And if I don't got enough in the tank, maybe I can just siphon enough
To fill up this last can, man, will I survive in this climate or what?
They said I was washed-up and got a bloodbath
I'm not a rapper, I'm an adapter: I can adjust
Plus, I can just walk up to a mic and just bust
So, floor's open if you'd like to discuss
Top 5 in this muh'fucka, and if I don't make the cut
What? Like I give a fuck! I'ma light this bitch up like I'm driving a truck
Through the side of a pump, 0 to 60, hop in and gun it
Like G-Unit without the hyphen, I'm hyping 'em up
And if there should ever come a time where my life's in a rut
And I look like I might just give up, eh, might've mistook
Me for bowin' out, I ain't takin' a bow, I'm stabbin' myself
With a fuckin' knife in the gut while I'm wipin' my butt
'Cause I just shitted on the mic and I like gettin' cut
I get excited at the sight of my blood, you're in a fight with a nut
'Cause I'ma fight 'til I die or win, bitin' the dust
It'll just make me angrier; wait, let me remind you of what
Got me this far, picture me quittin'
Now draw a circle around it and put a line through it, slut!
It's survival of what?

[Chorus: Liz Rodrigues]
This is survival of the fittest
This is do or die
This is the winner takes it all
So, take it all, a-all, a-all, a-all
So, take it all, a-all, a-all, a-all

[Verse 3: Eminem]
(Yeah) So, get your ideas, stack your ammo
But don't come unless you come to battle, now mount up, jump in the saddle
This is it'it's what you eat, sleep, piss and shit
Live, breathe, your whole existence just consists of this
Refuse to quit, fuse is lit, can't defuse the wick
If I don't do this music shit, I'll lose my shit
Ain't got shit to lose, it's the moment of truth, it's all I know how to do
As soon as I get thrown in a booth, I spit
But my respect is overdue, I'm showin' you the flow no one do
'Cause I don't own no diploma for school, I quit
So there's nothin' for me to fall back on, I know no other trade
So you better trade your fuckin' mics in for some tool-box-es
'Cause you'll never take my pride from me, it'll have to be pried from me
So, pull out your pliers and your screwdrivers!
But I want you to doubt me, I don't want you to buh-lieve
'Cause this is somethin' that I must use to succeed
And if you don't like me, then fuck you! Self-esteem
Must be fuckin' shootin' through the roof, 'cause trust me
My skin is too thick and bulletproof to touch me
I can see why the fuck I disgust you, I must be
Allergic to failure, 'cause everytime I come close to it
I just sneeze, but I just go achoo then a-chieve!

[Chorus: Liz Rodrigues]
This is survival of the fittest
This is do or die
This is the winner takes it all
So, take it all, a-all, a-all, a-all
So, take it all, a-all, a-all, a-all

[Chorus]
I'm not afraid (I'm not afraid)
To take a stand (To take a stand)
Everybody (Everybody)
Come take my hand (Come take my hand)
We'll walk this road together, through the storm
Whatever weather, cold or warm
Just lettin' you know that you're not alone
Holla if you feel like you've been down the same road

[Intro]
Yeah, it's been a ride
I guess I had to go to that place to get to this one
Now some of you might still be in that place
If you're tryna get out, just follow me
I'll get you there

[Verse 1]
You can try and read my lyrics off of this paper before I lay 'em
But you won't take the sting out these words before I say 'em
'Cause ain't no way I'ma let you stop me from causin' mayhem
When I say I'ma do somethin', I do it
I don't give a damn what you think, I'm doin' this for me
So fuck the world, feed it beans
It's gassed up if it thinks it's stoppin' me
I'ma be what I set out to be, without a doubt, undoubtably
And all those who look down on me
I'm tearin' down your balcony
No ifs, ands or buts, don't try to ask him why or how can he
From Infinite down to the last Relapse album he's still shittin'
Whether he's on salary, paid hourly
Until he bows out or he shits his bowels out of him
Whichever comes first, for better or worse
He's married to the game
Like a "fuck you" for Christmas, his gift is a curse
Forget the Earth, he's got the urge to pull his dick from the dirt
And fuck the whole universe

[Chorus]
I'm not afraid (I'm not afraid)
To take a stand (To take a stand)
Everybody (Everybody)
Come take my hand (Come take my hand)
We'll walk this road together, through the storm
Whatever weather, cold or warm
Just lettin' you know that you're not alone
Holla if you feel like you've been down the same road

[Verse 2]
Okay, quit playin' with the scissors and shit, and cut the crap
I shouldn't have to rhyme these words in a rhythm
For you to know it's a rap
You said you was king, you lied through your teeth
For that, fuck your feelings
Instead of gettin' crowned, you're gettin' capped
And to the fans, I'll never let you down again, I'm back
I promise to never go back on that promise
In fact, let's be honest, that last Relapse CD was "ehh"
Perhaps I ran them accents into the ground
Relax, I ain't goin' back to that now
All I'm tryin' to say is get back, click-clack-blaow
'Cause I ain't playin' around
There's a game called circle and I don't know how
I'm way too up to back down
But I think I'm still tryin' to figure this crap out
Thought I had it mapped out, but I guess I didn't
This fuckin' black cloud still follows me around
But it's time to exorcise these demons
These muh'fuckers are doin' jumpin' jacks now

[Chorus]
I'm not afraid (I'm not afraid)
To take a stand (To take a stand)
Everybody (Everybody)
Come take my hand (Come take my hand)
We'll walk this road together, through the storm
Whatever weather, cold or warm
Just lettin' you know that you're not alone
Holla if you feel like you've been down the same road

[Bridge]
And I just can't keep livin' this way
So startin' today
I'm breakin' out of this cage
I'm standin' up, I'ma face my demons
I'm mannin' up, I'ma hold my ground
I've had enough, now I'm so fed up
Time to put my life back together right now

[Verse 3]
It was my decision to get clean, I did it for me
Admittedly I probably did it subliminally for you
So I could come back a brand-new me
You helped see me through
And don't even realize what you did, believe me you
I've been through the wringer
But they can do little to the middle finger
I think I got a tear in my eye, I feel like the king of
My world, haters can make like bees with no stingers
And drop dead: no more beef lingers
No more drama from now on, I promise
To focus solely on handlin' my responsibilities as a father
So I solemnly swear to always treat this roof like my daughters
And raise it, you couldn't lift a single shingle on it
'Cause the way I feel, I'm strong enough to go to the club
Or the corner pub and lift the whole liquor counter up
'Cause I'm raisin' the bar
I'd shoot for the moon, but I'm too busy gazin' at stars
I feel amazin', and I'm'

[Chorus]
I'm not afraid (I'm not afraid)
To take a stand (To take a stand)
Everybody (Everybody)
Come take my hand (Come take my hand)
We'll walk this road together, through the storm
Whatever weather, cold or warm
Just lettin' you know that you're not alone
Holla if you feel like you've been down the same road

[Intro: Haddaway, Eminem, & Lil Wayne]
Love, love
Love, love, love
[Mumbling chorus]
Don't hurt me
Don't hurt me no more
Young Money, yeah
No more
Love

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne & Haddaway]
Throw dirt on me and grow a wildflower
But it's "Fuck the world," get a child out her
Yeah, my life a bitch, but you know nothing 'bout her
Been to hell and back, I can show you vouchers (No love)
I'm rollin' Sweets, I'm smokin' sour
Married to the game, but she broke her vows
That's why my bars are full of broken bottles
And my nightstands are full of open Bibles
Uh, I think about more than I forget
But I don't go around fire expectin' not to sweat
And these niggas know I lay 'em down, make your bed
Bitches try to kick me while I'm down, I'll break your leg
Money outweighin' problems on a triple beam
I'm stickin' to the script, you niggas skippin' scenes
Uh, be good or be good at it
Fuckin' right, I got my gun, semi-Cartermatic
Yeah, put a dick in they mouth, so I guess it's fuck what they say
I'm high as a bitch, up, up and away
Man, I'll come down in a couple of days
Okay, you want me up in the cage?
Then I'll come out in beast mode
I got this world stuck in the safe, combination is the G code
It's Weezy, motherfucker, Blood gang, and I'm in bleed mode
All about my dough, but I don't even check the peephole
So you can keep knockin', but won't knock me down
No love lost, no love found

[Chorus: Eminem, Lil Wayne, Both, & (Haddaway)]
It's a little too late to say that you're sorry now (Yeah)
You kicked me when I was down
But what you say just don't (Hurt me)
That's right, it don't (Hurt me)
And I don't need you (No more)
Don't wanna see you (No more)
Ha, bitch, you get no (Love)
You showed me nothing but hate (Haha!)
You ran me into the ground
But what comes around goes around (Yeah)
And I don't need you (Don't hurt me)
That's right, you don't (Hurt me)
And I don't need you (No more)
Don't wanna see you
Ha, bitch, you get (No love)
No! (No love) No! (No love) No! (No love)
Ha, bitch, you get (No love)
No! (No love) No! (No love)
And I don't need you (No more)
Get 'em!

[Verse 2: Eminem, Lil Wayne, & Both]
I'm alive again, more alive than I have been
In my whole entire life, I can (Yeah)
See these people's ears perk up as I begin to spaz with the pen
Uh, I'm a little bit sicker than most
Shit's finna get thick again, they say the competition is stiff
But I get a hard dick from this shit and I stick it in
I ain't never giving in again (Yeah)
Caution to the wind, complete freedom
Look at these rappers, how I treat 'em
So why the fuck would I join 'em when I beat 'em? (Yeah!)
They call me a freak, 'cause I like to
Spit on these pussies 'fore I eat 'em (Haha)
Man, get these whack cocksuckers off stage!
Where the fuck is Kanye when you need him? (Oh!)
Snatch the mic from 'em, bitch, I'ma let you finish in a minute
Yeah, that rap was tight, but I'm (Yeah!)
'Bout to spit the greatest verse of all time
So you might want to go back to the lab tonight and, um (Yeah!)
Scribble out them rhymes you were gonna spit
And start over from scratch and write new ones
But I'm afraid that it ain't gonna make no difference
When I rip this stage and tear it in half tonight
It's an adrenaline rush to feel the bass thump
From the place all the way to the parking lot, fellow
Set fire to the mic and ignite the crowd (Yeah)
You can see the sparks from hot metal (Yeah)
Cold-hearted, from the day I Bogarted
The game, my soul started to rot, fellow (Yeah)
When I'm not even in my harshest
You can still get roasted, 'cause Marsh is not mellow
'Til I'm topplin' from the top, I'm not gonna stop
I'm standin' on my Monopoly board (Uh)
That means I'm on top of my game
And it don't stop 'til my hip don't hop anymore (Shit)
When you're so good that you can't say it
'Cause it ain't even cool for you to sound cocky anymore (Shit)
People just get sick 'cause you spit
These fools can't drool or dribble a drop anymore (Ow!)
And you can never break my stride (Nope)
You'll never slow the momentum at any moment
I'm 'bout to blow, you'll never take my pride
Killin' the flow, slow venom
And the opponent is gettin' no mercy, mark my words
Ain't lettin' up, relentless, I smell blood
I don't give a fuck, keep givin' them hell
Where was you when I fell and needed help up?
You get no love

[Chorus: Eminem, Lil Wayne, Both, & (Haddaway)]
It's a little too late to say that you're sorry now (Uh)
You kicked me when I was down
But what you say just don't (Hurt me)
Yeah, that's right, it don't (Hurt me)
And I don't need you (No more)
Don't wanna see you (No more)
Ha, bitch, you get no (Love)
You showed me nothing but hate (Yeah!)
You ran me into the ground
But what comes around goes around
And I don't need you (Don't hurt me)
That's right, you don't (Hurt me)
And I don't need you (No more)
Don't wanna see you
Ha, bitch, you get (No love)
No! (No love) No! (No love) No! (No love)
Ha, bitch, you get (No love)
No! (No love) No! (No love)
And I don't need you (No more)
Ha, bitch, you get (No love)

[Intro]
Lately I've been hard to reach
I've been too long on my own
Everybody has a private world
Where they can be alone
Are you calling me?
Are you trying to get through?
Are you reaching out for me?
Then I'm reaching out for you

[Verse 1]
I'm just so fuckin' depressed
I just can't seem to get out this slump
If I could just get over this hump
But I need somethin' to pull me out this dump
I took my bruises, took my lumps
Fell down and I got right back up
But I need that spark to get psyched back up
In order for me to pick the mic back up
I don't know how or why or when
I ended up in this position I'm in
I'm starting to feel distant again
So I decided just to pick this pen
Up and try to make an attempt to vent
But I just can't admit
Or come to grips with the fact that I may be done with rap
I need a new outlet
And I know some shit's so hard to swallow
But I just can't sit back and wallow
In my own sorrow, but I know one fact:
I'll be one tough act to follow
One tough act to follow, I'll be one tough act to follow
Here today, gone tomorrow
But you'd have to walk a thousand miles'

[Pre-Chorus]
In my shoes, just to see
What it's like to be me
I'll be you, let's trade shoes
Just to see what it'd be like to
Feel your pain, you feel mine
Go inside each other's minds
Just to see what we find
Look at shit through each other's eyes

[Chorus]
But don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful
They can all get fucked, just stay true to you
Don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful
They can all get fucked, just stay true to you

[Verse 2]
I think I'm starting to lose my sense of humor
Everything's so tense and gloom
I almost feel like I gotta check the temperature
Of the room, just as soon as
I walk in, it's like all eyes on me
So I try to avoid any eye contact
'Cause if I do that, then it opens a door
For conversation like I want that
I'm not lookin' for extra attention
I just wanna be just like you
Blend in with the rest of the room
Maybe just point me to the closest restroom
I don't need no fuckin' man servant
Tryna follow me around and wipe my ass
Laugh at every single joke I crack
And half of 'em ain't even funny, like, "Ha!
Marshall, you're so funny, man
You should be a comedian, goddamn!"
Unfortunately I am
I just hide behind the tears of a clown
So why don't you all sit down?
Listen to the tale I'm about to tell
Hell, we don't gotta trade our shoes
And you ain't gotta walk no thousand miles'

[Pre-Chorus]
In my shoes, just to see
What it's like to be me
I'll be you, let's trade shoes
Just to see what it'd be like to
Feel your pain, you feel mine
Go inside each other's minds
Just to see what we find
Look at shit through each other's eyes

[Chorus]
But don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful
They can all get fucked, just stay true to you
Don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful
They can all get fucked, just stay true to you

[Verse 3]
Nobody asked for life to deal us
With these bullshit hands we're dealt
We gotta take these cards ourselves
And flip 'em, don't expect no help
Now, I could've either just sat on my ass and pissed and moaned
Or take this situation in which I'm placed in
And get up and get my own
I was never the type of kid to wait by the door and pack his bags
And sat on the porch and hoped and prayed
For a dad to show up who never did
I just wanted to fit in in every single place, every school I went
I dreamed of being that cool kid
Even if it meant acting stupid
Aunt Edna always told me:
"Keep making that face, it'll get stuck like that."
Meanwhile, I'm just standin' there
Holdin' my tongue, tryin' to talk like this
'Til I stuck my tongue on that frozen stop sign pole at 8 years old
I learned my lesson then
'Cause I wasn't tryin' to impress my friends no mo'
But I already told you my whole life story
Not just based on my description
'Cause where you see it from where you're sittin'
It's probably 110% different
I guess we would have to walk a mile in each other's shoes at least
What size you wear? I wear 10's
Let's see if you can fit your feet'

[Pre-Chorus]
In my shoes, just to see
What it's like to be me
I'll be you, let's trade shoes
Just to see what it'd be like to
Feel your pain, you feel mine
Go inside each other's minds
Just to see what we find
Look at shit through each other's eyes

[Chorus]
But don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful
They can all get fucked, just stay true to you
Don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful
They can all get fucked, just stay true to you

[Bridge]
Lately I've been hard to reach
I've been too long on my own
Everybody has a private world
Where they can be alone
Are you calling me?
Are you trying to get through?
Are you reaching out for me?
Then I'm reaching out for you

[Outro]
Yeah, to my babies: stay strong
Daddy'll be home soon
And to the rest of the world: God gave you them shoes to fit you
So put 'em on and wear 'em, be yourself, man
Be proud of who you are, even if it sounds corny
Never let no one tell you you ain't beautiful

[Intro]
Motherfuckers talkin' crazy (Yeah)
Sayin' I should quit (Ah)
I fuckin' tell 'em make me (Bitch)
Eat a fuckin' dick (Yeah)
I'm feelin' like the greatest (Woo!)
On the beat who ever did it
Mike WiLL the one who made it
It's Shady on the lyrics

[Verse 1]
I'm somewhat outlandish they say
You say we're cut from the same cloth
But I guess you fabricate, eh?
You better bring more men than the Latter Day Saints
Manic states, Stephen Paddock with automatic stay sprayin'
At anything that may stand in they way
As I stand at the bay window with a hand grenade
And a trey eight, at the Mandalay Bay
Common sense, I'm a dollar short and a day late
James Holmes at the Saturday Batman matinee
Must have missed my CAT scan that day (Yeah!)
I just threw a Tampax at Dre
Trashcan, Tascam and ashtray
I'm turnin' back to a madman, can't take
Anymore but I try to get away from the anger and rage
My basal ganglia's an A to the K
Get your ass sprayed like bidets
Breakin' your legs eight different ways, ankle to waist
You chumps don't even know how to do somethin'
To give goosebumps a day when you say
That somethin' you wrote gave someone a lump in their throat
Or you had them choked up, you'd be yankin' my chain (Ayy)
Feelin' like I'm headed for the padded cell, the
Bar for me when I rap isn't fair but
Guess that's the standard I'm held to
But if somethin' like that doesn't tell ya
You set a mark too high when platinum sales are
Looked at as a failure (Yeah)
Then you better take it back to The Shelter and Hamburger Helper
'Cause, damn it, I'm still the

[Chorus]
Greatest in the world, greatest in the world, greatest in the world
No lie, I might be
The best to ever do it, the best to ever do it, the best to ever do it
I feel like the greatest
Woke up to honkies sounding like me
Never be as good, never be as good
Packing up wife-beaters, white t-shirts, white
But I'm the greatest

[Verse 2]
So you sold ten million albums, eh? (What?)
Only problem is, you put out ten million albums, eh? (Haha! Wait)
What was I just about to say?
Oh yeah, let me get this out the way
I know there's people that are pissed about the way
I mispronounced a name, "DIE ANTWOORD!"
Fuck, I still can't say this shit, but how quickly they forget
Who the fuck I was; now Ninja try to duck my slugs
You let ya girl get fucked by Muggs
I'd like to give a shout to Cypress (Woo!)
This can't be real, you dissed me and I was just tryin' to
Give you a shout'now get the fuck out my rhyme book
No more shiners, already too much time took
And rappers I hear you talkin' shit
I'm just too big to respond to it
God forbid I forget, go and jump out the window
Somebody better child-proof it
'Cause if I lose it we can rewind to some old Ja Rule shit
And I can remind motherfuckers how I do shit
You don't got the tools I got in my toolkit (Bitch!)
I bullshit you not, y'all fools just forgot
That I'm so fuckin' awful with the thoughts
And when I'm hostile and impossible to stop
So you can call it a nostril 'cause it's not gonna ever
I'll never let up on the pedal, might as well get the mop
'Cause I'm wipin' up everyone in this genre
'Cause on the mic I feel like I'm the

[Chorus]
Greatest in the world, greatest in the world, greatest in the world
No lie, I might be
The best to ever do it, the best to ever do it, the best to ever do it
I feel like the greatest
Woke up to honkies sounding like me
Never be as good, never be as good
Packing up wife-beaters, white t-shirts, white
But I'm the greatest

[Verse 3]
Oh yeah, and one more thing I want to mention (What?)
Is you're one dimension
I'm a monkey wrench and I can flunk detention
And I love contentions, so welcome to the gun convention
Muscles flexin', gotta strut like a front suspension
And you just stuck the key up in the ignition
And gave me enough gas to flood my engine (Yeah)
Psychopath, Michael Jack's blowin' up like a raft
I should slap Vlad with a ISIS flag
Bet you I come back twice as bad (Uh)
Revival didn't go viral!
Denaun and Royce tell me that I should take the high road
Fuck that, I'm finna hit back
'Til I run out of gunpowder and split the scene
Hold the mic similar to pistol, squeeze
And I shoot from the hip when I grip them things
And my lips are the clips, got the sig lit like it's nicotine
Trigger me and Slim gets mean (Brr!)
Bars are like bullets when I spit them schemes
That's why I call the motherfuckers M16s (Woo!)
Float like a butterfly, I'm gonna sting like a bee
You ain't harmin' a thing
I hit a ding hard as I'm gonna swing
I'm gonna need to put my arm in a sling
But like a wedding band
You gotta be diamond to even climb in the ring
Anomaly, I'm Muhammad Ali
'Cause I knew one day (Hey!) I'm gonna be the

[Chorus]
Greatest in the world, greatest in the world, greatest in the world
No lie, I might be
The best to ever do it, the best to ever do it, the best to ever do it
I feel like the greatest
Woke up to honkies sounding like me
Never be as good, never be as good
Packing up wife-beaters, white t-shirts, white
But I'm the greatest

[Intro]
Yeah, it's my life
In my own words, I guess

[Verse 1]
Have you ever loved someone so much, you'd give an arm for?
Not the expression, no, literally give an arm for
When they know they're your heart and you know you are their armor
And you will destroy anyone who would try to harm her
But what happens when karma turns right around to bite you?
And everything you stand for turns on you to spite you?
What happens when you become the main source of her pain?
"Daddy, look what I made!" "Dad's gotta go catch a plane"
"Daddy, where's Mommy? I can't find Mommy, where is she?"
"I don't know, go play, Hailie, baby, your daddy's busy
Daddy's writin' a song, this song ain't gon' write itself
I'll give you one underdog, then you gotta swing by yourself"
Then turn right around on that song and tell her you love her
And put hands on her mother who's a spitting image of her
That's Slim Shady, yeah, baby, Slim Shady's crazy
Shady made me, but tonight Shady's rock-a-bye baby

[Chorus]
And when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn, rejoice
Every time you hear the sound of my voice, just know that
I'm lookin' down on you smilin' and I didn't feel a thing
So, baby, don't feel my pain, just smile back
And when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn, rejoice
Every time you hear the sound of my voice, just know that
I'm lookin' down on you smilin' and I didn't feel a thing
So, baby, don't feel my pain, just smile back

[Verse 2]
I keep havin' this dream, I'm pushin' Hailie on the swing
She keeps screamin' she don't want me to sing
"You're makin' Mommy cry, why? Why is Mommy cryin'?"
"Baby, Daddy ain't leavin' no more" "Daddy, you're lyin'!
You always say that, you always say this is the last time
But you ain't leavin' no more, Daddy, you're mine!"
She's pilin' boxes in front of the door, tryna block it
"Daddy, please! Daddy, don't leave! Daddy, no, stop it!"
Goes in her pocket, pulls out a tiny necklace locket
It's got a picture, "This'll keep you safe, Daddy, take it with ya!"
I look up, it's just me standin' in the mirror
These fuckin' walls must be talkin', 'cause man, I can hear 'em
They're sayin', "You got one more chance to do right and it's tonight
Now go out there and show 'em that you love 'em 'fore it's too late!"
And just as I go to walk out of my bedroom door
It turns to a stage, they're gone and this spotlight is on and I'm singin'

[Chorus]
And when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn, rejoice
Every time you hear the sound of my voice, just know that
I'm lookin' down on you smilin' and I didn't feel a thing
So, baby, don't feel my pain, just smile back
And when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn, rejoice
Every time you hear the sound of my voice, just know that
I'm lookin' down on you smilin' and I didn't feel a thing
So, baby, don't feel my pain, just smile back

[Verse 3]
60,000 people all jumpin' out their seat
The curtain closes, they're throwin' roses at my feet
I take a bow, and thank you all for comin' out
They're screamin' so loud, I take one last look at the crowd
I glance down, I don't believe what I'm seein'
"Daddy, it's me! Help Mommy, her wrists are bleedin'!"
But baby, we're in Sweden, how did you get to Sweden?
"I followed you, Daddy, you told me that you weren't leavin'
You lied to me, Dad, and now you made Mommy sad
And I bought you this coin, it says 'Number One Dad'
That's all I wanted, I just wanna give you this coin
I get the point, fine, me and Mommy are goin'."
But baby, wait! ' "It's too late, Dad, you made the choice
Now go up there and show 'em that you love 'em more than us
That's what they want, they want you, Marshall, they keep
Screamin' your name, it's no wonder you can't go to sleep
Just take another pill, yeah, I bet you you will
You rap about it, yeah, word, k-keep it real."
I hear applause, all this time I couldn't see
How could it be that the curtain is closin' on me?
I turn around, find a gun on the ground, cock it
Put it to my brain, scream, "Die, Shady!" and pop it
The sky darkens, my life flashes, the plane that I was
Supposed to be on crashes and burns to ashes
That's when I wake up, alarm clock's ringin', there's birds singin'
It's spring and Hailie's outside swingin'
I walk right up to Kim and kiss her, tell her I miss her
Hailie just smiles, and winks at her little sister, almost as if to say

[Chorus]
And when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn, rejoice
Every time you hear the sound of my voice, just know that
I'm lookin' down on you smilin' and I didn't feel a thing
So, baby, don't feel my pain, just smile back
And when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn, rejoice
Every time you hear the sound of my voice, just know that
I'm lookin' down on you smilin' and I didn't feel a thing
So, baby, don't feel my pain, just smile back

[Verse 1: Eminem]
Something's burnin', I can't figure out what (out what)
It's either lust or a cloud of dust
Judgement is clouded; must
Just be the powder from the power of (love)
But I'm in something I don't know how to get out of
Left my girl in the house alone
Is that my soon-to-be-spouse's moan?
And the further I walk, the louder
Pause for a minute to make certain that's what I heard
'Cause after all, this is her place
So I give her the benefit of the doubt, I
Think I might be about to bust her, bust her
The thought's scary, yo, though and it hurts'brace!
Hope it ain't, "Here we go, yo!"
'Cause my head already goes to worst-case
Scenario, though in the first place
But you confirmed my low-end theory though
Should've known when I made it all the way to third base
And that was only the first date
Could've made it to home plate
But you slid straight for the dome and dove face first
"No, (*slurp*) you don't (*slurp*) under' (*slurp*) 'stand, (*slurp*)
I (*slurp*) don't (*slurp*) do this for (*hic*) anyone, (*hic*) ever (*slurp*)."
Yeah, that ain't what they all say?
I'll say, you can suck a softball through a straw
Used to be my fianc'
'Til you sucked on Wayne, Andr', and Kanye
LeBron, Akon, Jay, Lil Jon, Raekwon, Ma$e
Polow da Don, Dre, Dante Ross, James Conway, Kwam'
Guess I'm gettin' my g-goddang Jigga on, eh?
'Cause your name, I'm beyond sayin'
But fuck it, I'm movin' on, you women are all cray
But I'll probably always keep on playin' the'

Game of love, love, love, love
La-la-la-la-la love

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
She doesn't love me, no, she don't love me no more
She hates my company, guess she don't love me no more
I tried to get her up out of my head, left my bags at the door
She screamed she loved me like she never did before
And I told her, "Go where you wanna!
Go do whatcha wanna do, I don't care!"
And I told her, "Go where you wanna!
Go do whatcha wanna do, I don't care!"

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
I told that bitch, "I'm a sucker for love, you a sucker for dick."
Suckin' dick in your mama tub, then your granny walked in
Told the stupid nigga to duck under the water
He drowned, like an abortion
They booked you for manslaughter
You beat the case and I called ya
"Sherane is not available now, leave a message at the tone
And Kendrick, don't forget to buy two pair of those
Expensive heels, you little fuckin' Ferris wheel
Fuckin' spinnin' on me'fuck you think, we gon' get married still?
Fuckin' Mary had a little lamb, this ain't no fairy tale
Fairy godmama better tell you how I fuckin' feel
Like you should fuckin' beat it
Or fuckin' eat it while I'm on my period
Now have a blessed day." (*Phone hangs up*) Bitch, you serious?
I'm in the mirror with this look on my face, curious
Why you ain't fuckin' with me, you cut me deep as Caesarean
You know I want you bad as a Benjamin, I'm delirious
I want you bad as the head shattered on George Zimmerman
After the Dillinger hit him diligently and killin' him
His mouthpiece for a Cadillac emblem
That's analogy and metaphor for you
I should win a medal for all the ways I adore you
This is me talkin' cordial, yeah, I got some home training
That ain't what you like, ain't it?
What about if I was as famous as Marshall?
Would you give fellatio in the carpool?
Cops pull us over, they just wanna know if you gargle
Singin', "I hope she's good enough
Meanwhile you're chasin' her"
Chlamydia couldn't even get rid of her
Pity the fool and pity the fool in me, I'ma live with the'

[Bridge: Wayne Fontana]
Game of love, love, love, love
La-la-la-la-la love

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar (with Eminem)]
(She doesn't love me, no, she don't love me no more)
(She hates my company, guess she don't love me no more)
I tried to get her up out of my head, left my bags at the door
She screamed she loved me like she never did before
And I told her, "Go where you wanna!
Go do whatcha wanna do, I don't care!"
And I told her, "Go where you wanna!
Go do whatcha wanna do, I don't care!"

[Verse 3: Eminem]
So needless to say I'm feelin' betrayed
Snatch my house key off her key chain
She jumps off Wee-Bey from The Wire's dick
Now she's chasin' me with a cheese grater
Here goes that broken record clich'
It's all my fault anyway, she's turnin' the tables, I'm a beat-break
She treats my face like Serato, she cuts and scratches like a DJ
Each day is an Instant Replay
They say what we display is symptomatic of addict behavior
Back together, but forgot today was her B-day
She cut me off on the freeway
Simple misunderstanding, but just as I went to slam on the brakes
That's when I realized that she may be crazy as me, wait
Bitch cut my fuckin' brakeline
Stepped on them fuckers eight times
Still goin' 73, thank God there's an exit comin' up
What the mother-F-U-C-K's wrong with her?
Hit the off ramp 'til I coasted to a goshdamn halt
Hit a fuckin' tree, now here she comes at full speed
She's racin' at me, okay, you wanna fuck with me, eh?
Snatch that bitch out her car through the window
She screamin', I body slam her on the cement
Until the concrete gave and created a sinkhole
Buried the stink ho in it, then paid to have the street repaved
(The fuck?) Woke up in a dream state
In a cold sweat like I got hit with a freeze ray during a heat wave
Guess I eventually caved though, 'cause she's layin' next to me in bed'directly aimin' a gat at my head!
Woke up again and jumped up
Like, "Fuck it! I've had it, I'm checkin' into rehab."
I confess I'm a static addict, I guess that's why I'm so clingy
Every girl I've ever had either says I got too much baggage
Or I'm too fuckin' dramatic
Man, what the fuck is the matter? I'm just a fuckin' romantic
I fuckin' love you, you fuckin' bitch!
Combative, possessive, in fact last time I was mad at an ex
I actually set off a chain reaction of tragic events
I said, "Hit the road", then after she left
I sent that bitch a text that said, "Be careful driving
Don't read this and have an accident"
She glanced to look at it and wrecked (*Car crashes*)
Too bad, thought we had a connect
No sense dwelling makes, never been a more compelling case
Than the model covered in L'Or'al and mace
Who fell from grace 11 stories for storytellin'
While the whore was yellin', "Rape!"
'Til her vocal cords were swellin'
And her voice were more hoarser than Tori Spellings' face
Still they swarm the gates of my fancy estates
To greet Norman Bates with a warm embrace
'Less you're Andrea Yates, don't ask me for a date though
You're late, well, the sentiment's great
But wait, think there's been a mistake
You wanted an intimate date, I wanna intimidate
I have infinite hate in my blood
It's mainly 'cause of the game of' (*Message sound*)
Wait, "dinner at eight"? I have infinite hate in my blood
It's mainly 'cause of the'

[Chorus: Eminem]
Hi, my name is, what? My name is, who?
My name is, chka-chka, Slim Shady
Hi, my name is, huh? My name is, what?
My name is, chka-chka, Slim Shady
Hi, my name is, what? (Excuse me) My name is, who?
My name is, chka-chka, Slim Shady
(Can I have the attention of the class for one second?)
Hi, my name is, huh? My name is, what?
My name is, chka-chka, Slim Shady

[Verse 1: Eminem & Dr. Dre]
Hi, kids, do you like violence? (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Wanna see me stick nine-inch nails through each one of my eyelids? (Uh-huh)
Wanna copy me and do exactly like I did? (Yeah, yeah)
Try 'cid and get fucked up worse than my life is? (Huh?)
My brain's dead weight, I'm tryna get my head straight
But I can't figure out which Spice Girl I want to impregnate (Oh)
And Dr. Dre said, "Slim Shady, you a basehead" (Uh-uh)
"Then why's your face red? Man, you wasted"
Well, since age 12, I felt like I'm someone else
'Cause I hung my original self from the top bunk with a belt
Got pissed off and ripped Pamela Lee's tits off
And smacked her so hard I knocked her clothes backwards like Kris Kross
I smoke a fat pound of grass, and fall on my ass
Faster than a fat bitch who sat down too fast
Come here, slut; "Shady, wait a minute, that's my girl, dawg"
I don't give a fuck, God sent me to piss the world off

[Chorus: Eminem]
Hi, my name is, what? My name is, who?
My name is, chka-chka, Slim Shady
Hi, my name is, huh? My name is, what?
My name is, chka-chka, Slim Shady
Hi, my name is, what? My name is, who?
My name is, chka-chka, Slim Shady
Hi, my name is, huh? My name is, what?
My name is, chka-chka, Slim Shady

[Verse 2: Eminem]
My English teacher wanted to flunk me in junior high (Shh)
Thanks a lot, next semester I'll be 35
I smacked him in his face with an eraser, chased him with a stapler
And stapled his nuts to a stack of paper (Ow)
Walked in the strip club, had my jacket zipped up
Flashed the bartender, then stuck my dick in the tip cup
Extraterrestrial, running over pedestrians in a spaceship While they're screaming at me, "Let's just be friends"
99 percent of my life, I was lied to
I just found out my mom does more dope than I do (Damn)
I told her I'd grow up to be a famous rapper
Make a record about doin' drugs and name it after her
(Oh, thank you)
You know you blew up when the women rush your stands
And try to touch your hands like some screamin' Usher fans
(Ahh, ahh, ahh)
This guy at White Castle asked for my autograph (Dude, can I get your autograph?)
So I signed it, "Dear Dave, thanks for the support, asshole"

[Chorus: Eminem]
Hi, my name is, huh? My name is, who?
My name is, chka-chka, Slim Shady
Hi, my name is, what? My name is, who?
My name is, chka-chka, Slim Shady
Hi, my name is, huh? My name is, who?
My name is, chka-chka, Slim Shady
Hi, my name is, what? My name is, who?
My name is, chka-chka, Slim Shady

[Verse 3: Eminem]
Stop the tape, this kid needs to be locked away (Get him)
Dr. Dre, don't just stand there, operate
I'm not ready to leave, it's too scary to die (Fuck that)
I'll have to be carried inside the cemetery and buried alive
(Huh, yup)
Am I comin' or goin'? I can barely decide
I just drank a fifth of vodka, dare me to drive? (Go ahead)
All my life I was very deprived
I ain't had a woman in years and my palms are too hairy to hide (Whoops)
Clothes ripped like the Incredible Hulk
I spit when I talk, I'll fuck anything that walks (Come here)
When I was little, I used to get so hungry I would throw fits
How you gonna breastfeed me, Mom? You ain't got no tits
I lay awake and strap myself in the bed
With a bulletproof vest on and shoot myself in the head (Bang)
'Cause I'm steamin' mad (Grr)
And by the way, when you see my dad (Yeah?)
Tell him that I slit his throat in this dream I had

[Chorus: Eminem]
Hi, my name is, what? My name is, who?
My name is, chka-chka, Slim Shady
Hi, my name is, huh? My name is, what?
My name is, chka-chka, Slim Shady
Hi, my name is, who? My name is, huh?
My name is, chka-chka, Slim Shady
Hi, my name is, huh? My name is, who?
My name is, chka-chka, Slim Shady

[Intro: Polina]
Tell me where to go
Tell me what to do
I'll be right there for you
Tell me what to say
No matter if it's true
I'll say it all for you

[Verse 1: Eminem]
I used to be the type of kid
That would always think the sky is fallin'
Why am I so differently wired? Am I a martian?
What kind of twisted experiment am I involved in?
'Cause I don't belong in this world
That's why I'm scoffin' at authority, defiant often
Flyin' off at the handle at my mom
No dad, so I am noncompliant at home
At school I'm just shy and awkward
And I don't need no goddamn psychologist
Tryna diagnose why I have all these underlyin' problems
Thinkin' he can try and solve 'em
I'm outside chalkin' up drawings
On the sidewalk and in the front drive talkin'
To myself, either that or inside hidin' off in
The corner somewhere quiet, tryin' not to
Be noticed 'cause I'm cryin' and sobbin'
I had a bad day at school so I ain't talkin'
Some cocksucker shoved me into a fuckin' locker
'Cause he said that I eye-balled him

[Pre-Chorus: Polina]
And if you fall, I'll get you there
I'll be your savior from all the wars
That are fought inside your world
Please have faith in my words

[Chorus: Polina]
'Cause this is my legacy, legacy, yeah
This is my legacy, legacy, yeah
There's no guarantee
It's not up to me, we can only see
This is my legacy, legacy, legacy, legacy

[Verse 2: Eminem]
I used to be the type of kid that would always think the sky's fallin'
Why am I so differently wired in my noggin?
'Cause sporadic as my thoughts come, it's mind-bogglin'
'Cause I obsess on everything in my mind, small shit
Bothers me, but not my father, he said sayonara
Then split, but I don't give a shit
I'm fine long as there's batteries in my Walkman
Nothing is the matter with me
Shit, look on the bright side, at least I ain't walkin'
I bike ride through the neighborhood of my apartment
Complex on a ten-speed which I've acquired parts that
I find in the garbage, a frame then put tires on it
Headphones on, look straight ahead if kids try and start shit
But if this is all there is for me life offers
Why bother even tryin' to put up a fight? It's nonsense
But I think a light bulb just lit up in my conscience
What about them rhymes I've been jottin'?
They are kind of giving me confidence
Instead of tryin' to escape through my comics
Why don't I just blast a little something like Onyx?
To put me in the mood to wanna fight and write songs that
Say what I wanna say to the kid that said that I eye-balled him
Grab hold of my balls, like, "That's right, fight's on, bitch!"
Who woulda knew, from the moment I turned the mic on, that
I could be iconic in my conquest?
That's word to Phife Dawg from A Tribe Called Quest

[Chorus: Polina]
This is my legacy, legacy, yeah
This is my legacy, legacy, yeah
There's no guarantee
It's not up to me, we can only see
This is my legacy, legacy, legacy, legacy

[Verse 3: Eminem]
I used to be the type of kid that would always think the sky's fallin'
Now I think the fact that I'm differently wired's awesome
'Cause if I wasn't, I wouldn't be able to work words like this
And connect lines like crosswords
And use my enemy's words as strength
To try and draw from, and get inspired off 'em
'Cause all my life I was told and taught I am not shit
By you wack fuckin' giant sacks of lyin' dog shit
Now you shut up, bitch, I am talkin'
Thought I was full of horseshit
And now you fuckin' worship the ground on which I am walkin'
Me against the world, so what? I'm Brian Dawkins
Versus the whole 0-16 Lions offense
So bring on the Giants, Falcons, and Miami Dolphins
It's the body bag game, bitch, I'm supplyin' coffins
'Cause you dicks butt kiss, bunch of Brian Baldingers
You're gon' die a ball-licker, I've been diabolical
With this dialogue since '99 Rawkus
You don't respect the legacy I leave behind, y'all can
Suck a dick; the day you beat me, pigs'll fly out my ass
In a flyin' saucer full of Italian sausage
The most high exaltin' and I ain't haltin'
'Til I die of exhaustion, inhale my exhaust fumes
The best part about me is I am not you
I'm me, and I'm the Fire Marshall, and this is my'

[Chorus: Polina]
This is my legacy, legacy, yeah
This is my legacy, legacy, yeah
There's no guarantee
It's not up to me, we can only see
This is my legacy, legacy, legacy, legacy

[Intro]
Where's my snare?
I have no snare in my headphones
There you go, yeah, yo, yo

[Verse 1]
Have you ever been hated or discriminated against?
I have, I've been protested and demonstrated against
Picket signs for my wicked rhymes, look at the times
Sick is the mind of the motherfuckin' kid that's behind
All this commotion, emotions run deep as oceans, explodin'
Tempers flarin' from parents, just blow 'em off and keep goin'
Not takin' nothin' from no one, give 'em hell long as I'm breathin'
Keep kickin' ass in the morning and takin' names in the evenin'
Leave 'em with a taste as sour as vinegar in they mouth
See, they can trigger me, but they'll never figure me out
Look at me now! I bet you're prob'ly sick of me now
Ain't you, Mama? I'ma make you look so ridiculous now!

[Chorus]
I'm sorry, Mama
I never meant to hurt you
I never meant to make you cry
But tonight I'm cleanin' out my closet (One more time!)
I said I'm sorry, Mama
I never meant to hurt you
I never meant to make you cry
But tonight I'm cleanin' out my closet (Ha!)

[Verse 2]
I got some skeletons in my closet
And I don't know if no one knows it
So before they throw me inside my coffin and close it
I'ma expose it; I'll take you back to '73
Before I ever had a multi-platinum-selling CD
I was a baby, maybe I was just a couple of months
My faggot father must've had his panties up in a bunch
'Cause he split, I wonder if he even kissed me goodbye
No, I don't, on second thought, I just fuckin' wished he would die
I look at Hailie, and I couldn't picture leavin' her side
Even if I hated Kim, I'd grit my teeth and I'd try
To make it work with her at least for Hailie's sake
I maybe made some mistakes
But I'm only human, but I'm man enough to face 'em today
What I did was stupid, no doubt it was dumb
But the smartest shit I did was take the bullets out of that gun
'Cause I'da killed 'em, shit, I woulda shot Kim and him both
It's my life, I'd like to welcome y'all to The Eminem Show

[Chorus]
I'm sorry, Mama
I never meant to hurt you
I never meant to make you cry
But tonight I'm cleanin' out my closet (One more time!)
I said I'm sorry, Mama
I never meant to hurt you
I never meant to make you cry
But tonight I'm cleanin' out my closet (Uh)

[Verse 3]
Now, I would never diss my own mama just to get recognition
Take a second to listen 'fore you think this record is dissin'
But put yourself in my position, just try to envision
Witnessin' your mama poppin' prescription pills in the kitchen
Bitchin' that someone's always goin' through her purse and shit's missin'
Goin' through public housing systems
Victim of M'nchausen's Syndrome
My whole life I was made to believe I was sick when I wasn't
'Til I grew up, now I blew up
It makes you sick to your stomach, doesn't it?
Wasn't it the reason you made that CD for me, Ma?
So you could try to justify the way you treated me, Ma?
But guess what, you're gettin' older now
And it's cold when you're lonely
And Nathan's growin' up so quick
He's gonna know that you're phony
And Hailie's gettin' so big now, you should see her, she's beautiful
But you'll never see her'she won't even be at your funeral (ha-ha!)
See, what hurts me the most is you won't admit you was wrong
Bitch, do your song, keep tellin' yourself that you was a mom!
But how dare you try to take what you didn't help me to get?!
You selfish bitch, I hope you fuckin' burn in hell for this shit!
Remember when Ronnie died and you said you wished it was me?
Well, guess what, I am dead'dead to you as can be!

[Chorus]
I'm sorry, Mama
I never meant to hurt you
I never meant to make you cry
But tonight I'm cleanin' out my closet (One more time!)
I said I'm sorry, Mama
I never meant to hurt you
I never meant to make you cry
But tonight I'm cleanin' out my closet

...Man, whatever

[Intro]
Dre, just let it run
Ayo, turn the beat up a little bit
Ayo
This song is for anyone...
Fuck it, just shut up and listen
Ayo

[Verse 1]
I sit back with this pack of Zig-Zag's and this bag
Of this weed, it gives me the shit needed to be
The most meanest MC on this... on this Earth
And since birth I've been cursed with this curse to just curse
And just blurt this berserk and bizarre shit that works
And it sells and it helps in itself to relieve
All this tension, dispensin' these sentences
Gettin' this stress that's been eatin' me recently off
Of this chest and I rest again peacefully (Peacefully)
But at least have the decency in you
To leave me alone, when you freaks see me out
In the streets when I'm eatin' or feedin' my daughter
To not come and speak to me (Speak to me), I don't know you
And no, I don't owe you a motherfuckin' thing
I'm not Mr. N'Sync, I'm not what your friends think
I'm not Mr. Friendly, I can be a prick
If you tempt me, my tank is on empty (Is on empty)
No patience is in me and if you offend me
I'm liftin' you ten feet (Liftin' you ten feet) in the air
I don't care who was there and who saw me just jaw you
Go call you a lawyer, file you a lawsuit
I'll smile in the courtroom and buy you a wardrobe
I'm tired of all you (Of all you), I don't mean to be mean
But that's all I can be, it's just me

[Chorus]
And I am whatever you say I am
If I wasn't, then why would I say I am?
In the paper, the news, every day I am
Radio won't even play my jam
'Cause I am whatever you say I am
If I wasn't, then why would I say I am?
In the paper, the news, every day I am
I don't know, that's just the way I am

[Verse 2]
Sometimes I just feel like my father, I hate to be bothered
With all of this nonsense, it's constant
And, "Oh, it's his lyrical content
The song 'Guilty Conscience' has gotten such rotten responses."
And all of this controversy circles me
And it seems like the media immediately
Points a finger at me (Finger at me)
So I point one back at 'em, but not the index or pinkie
Or the ring or the thumb, it's the one you put up
When you don't give a fuck, when you won't just put up
With the bullshit they pull, 'cause they full of shit too
When a dude's gettin' bullied and shoots up his school
And they blame it on Marilyn (On Marilyn) and the heroin
Where were the parents at? And look where it's at!
Middle America, now it's a tragedy
Now it's so sad to see, an upper-class city
Havin' this happenin' (This happenin') then attack
Eminem 'cause I rap this way (Rap this way) but I'm glad
'Cause they feed me the fuel that I need for the fire to burn
And it's burnin', and I have returned

[Chorus]
And I am whatever you say I am
If I wasn't, then why would I say I am?
In the paper, the news, every day I am
Radio won't even play my jam
'Cause I am whatever you say I am
If I wasn't, then why would I say I am?
In the paper, the news, every day I am
I don't know, that's just the way I am

[Verse 3]
I'm so sick and tired of bein' admired
That I wish that I would just die or get fired
And dropped from my label, let's stop with the fables
I'm not gonna be able to top a "My Name Is"
And pigeon-holed into some poppy sensation
To cop me rotation at rock 'n' roll stations
And I just do not got the patience (Got the patience)
To deal with these cocky Caucasians
Who think I'm some wigger who just tries to be black 'cause I talk
With an accent and grab on my balls so they always
Keep askin' the same fuckin' questions (Fuckin' questions)
What school did I go to, what hood I grew up in
The why, the who, what, when, the where and the how
'Til I'm grabbin' my hair and I'm tearin' it out
'Cause they drivin' me crazy (Drivin' me crazy), I can't take it
I'm racin', I'm pacin', I stand and I sit
And I'm thankful for every fan that I get
But I can't take a shit in the bathroom without
Someone standin' by it! (Standin' by it) No, I won't sign your autograph
You can call me an asshole, I'm glad

[Chorus]
'Cause I am whatever you say I am
If I wasn't, then why would I say I am?
In the paper, the news, every day I am
Radio won't even play my jam
'Cause I am whatever you say I am
If I wasn't, then why would I say I am?
In the paper, the news, every day I am
I don't know, that's just the way I am

[Produced by Eminem]

[Verse 1: Eminem]
We touch, I feel a rush; we clutch, it isn't much
But it's enough to make me wonder what's in store for us
It's lust, it's torturous, you must be a sorceress
'Cause you just did the impossible: gained my trust
Don't play games, it'll be dangerous
If you fuck me over, 'cause if I get burnt, I'ma show ya
What it's like to hurt, 'cause I been treated like dirt before ya
And love is evil ' spell it backwards, I'll show ya
Nobody knows me, I'm cold, walk down this road all alone
It's no one's fault but my own, it's the path I've chosen to go
Frozen as snow, I show no emotion whatsoever so
Don't ask me why I have no love for these muh'fuckin' hoes
Bloodsuckin' succubuses, what the fuck is up with this?
I've tried in this department, but I ain't had no luck with this
It sucks, but it's exactly what I thought it would be like
Tryin' to start over, I got a hole in my heart
But some kind of emotional roller coaster
Is something I won't go on
So you toy with my emotions, so it's over
It's like an explosion every time I hold ya
Wasn't joking when I told ya
You take my breath away, you're a supernova, and I'm a'

[Chorus: Steve McEwan]
I'm a space-bound rocket ship and your heart's the Moon
And I'm aimin' right at you, right at you
250,000 miles on a clear night in June
And I'm aimin' right at you
Right at you, right at you

[Verse 2: Eminem]
I'll do whatever it takes, when I'm with you, I get the shakes
My body aches when I ain't with you, I have zero strength
There's no limit on how far I would go, no boundaries, no lengths
Why do we say that until we get that person that we think's
Gonna be that one? And then once we get 'em, it's never the same
You want 'em when they don't want you
Soon as they do, feelings change
It's not a contest and I ain't on no conquest for no mate
I wasn't lookin' when I stumbled on to you, musta been fate
But so much is at stake, what the fuck does it take?
Let's cut to the chase 'fore the door shuts in your face
Promise me if I cave in and break and leave myself open
That I won't be makin' a mistake, 'cause I'm a'

[Chorus: Steve McEwan]
I'm a space-bound rocket ship and your heart's the Moon
And I'm aimin' right at you, right at you
250,000 miles on a clear night in June
And I'm aimin' right at you
Right at you, right at you

[Verse 3: Eminem]
So, after a year and six months, it's no longer me that you want
But I love you so much it hurts, never mistreated you once
I poured my heart out to you, let down my guard, swear to God
I blow my brains in your lap, lay here and die in your arms
Drop to my knees and I'm pleadin', I'm tryna stop you from leavin'
You won't even listen, so fuck it, I'm tryna stop you from breathin'
I put both hands on your throat, I sit on top of you squeezin'
'Til I snap your neck like a Popsicle stick, ain't no possible reason
I can think of to let you walk up out this house and let you live
Tears stream down both of my cheeks
Now I let you go and just give
And 'fore I put that gun to my temple, I told you this

[Bridge: Eminem]
And I would've done anything for you
To show you how much I adored you
But it's over now, it's too late to save our love
Just promise me you'll think of me
Every time you look up in the sky and see a star, 'cause I'm a'

[Chorus: Steve McEwan]
I'm a space-bound rocket ship and your heart's the Moon
And I'm aimin' right at you, right at you
250,000 miles on a clear night in June
And I'm so lost without you
Without you, without you

[Hook]
Step by step, heart to heart
Left, right, left, we all fall down
Step by step, heart to heart
Left, right, left, we all fall down
Like toy soldiers
Bit by bit, torn apart
We never win, but the battle wages on
For toy soldiers

[Verse 1]
I'm supposed to be the soldier who never blows his composure
Even though I hold the weight of the whole world on my shoulders
I ain't never supposed to show it, my crew ain't supposed to know it
Even if it means goin' toe-to-toe with a Benzino
It don't matter, I never drag 'em in battles that I can't handle
'Less I absolutely have to, I'm supposed to set an example
I need to be the leader, my crew looks for me to guide 'em
If some shit ever does pop off, I'm supposed to be beside 'em
That Ja shit, I tried to squash it, it was too late to stop it
There's a certain line you just don't cross, and he crossed it
I heard him say Hailie's name on a song and I just lost it
It was crazy, the shit went way beyond some JAY-Z and Nas shit
And even though the battle was won, I feel like we lost it
I spent so much energy on it, honestly I'm exhausted
And I'm so caught in it that I almost feel I'm the one who caused it
This ain't what I'm in hip-hop for, that's not why I got in it
That was never my object, for someone to get killed
Why would I wanna destroy something I helped build?
That wasn't my intentions, my intentions were good
I went through my whole career without ever mentionin' ****
And that was just outta respect, for not runnin' my mouth
And talkin' about somethin' that I knew nothin' about
Plus Dre told me stay out, this just wasn't my beef
So I did, I just fell back, watched and gritted my teeth
While he's all over TV, down-talkin' the man
Who literally saved my life, like fuck it, I understand
This is business, and this shit just isn't none of my business
But still knowin' the shit could pop off at any minute, 'cause'

[Hook]
Step by step, heart to heart
Left, right, left, we all fall down
Like toy soldiers
Bit by bit, torn apart
We never win, but the battle wages on
For toy soldiers

[Verse 2]
There used to be a time when you could just say a rhyme and
Wouldn't have to worry about one of your people dyin'
But now it's elevated, 'cause once you put someone's kids in it
The shit gets escalated ' it ain't just words no more, is it?
It's a different ballgame, you call names and you ain't just rappin'
We actually tried to stop the 50 and Ja beef from happenin'
Me and Dre had sat with him, kicked it and had a chat with him
And asked him not to start it, he wasn't gonna go after him
Until Ja started yappin' in magazines how he stabbed him
Fuck it, 50, smash him! Mash on him, let him have it
Meanwhile my attention's pulled in another direction
Some receptionist at The Source who answers phones at his desk
Has an erection for me and thinks that I'll be his resurrection
Tries to blow the dust off his mic and make a new record
But now he's fucked the game up 'cause one of the ways I came up
Was through that publication, the same one that made me famous
Now the owner of it has got a grudge against me for nothin'?
Well, fuck it, that motherfucker could get it too, fuck him then!
But I'm so busy bein' pissed off, I don't stop to think
That we just inherited 50's beef with Murder Inc.
And he's inherited mine, which is fine, ain't like either of us mind
But we still have soldiers that's on the front line
Who's willin' to die for us as soon as we give the orders
Never to extort us, strictly to show they support us
And maybe shout 'em out in a rap or up in a chorus
To show 'em we love 'em back and let 'em know how important it is
To have Runyon Avenue soldiers up in our corners
Their loyalty to us is worth more than any award is
But I ain't tryna have none of my people hurt or murdered
It ain't worth it, I can't think of a perfecter way to word it
Than to just say that I love y'all too much to see the verdict
I'll walk away from it all 'fore I let it go any further
But don't get it twisted, it's not a plea that I'm coppin'
I'm just willin' to be the bigger man, if y'all can quit poppin'
Off at the jaws, well, then I can, 'cause frankly I'm sick of talkin'
I'm not gonna let someone else's coffin rest on my conscience 'cause'

[Hook]
Step by step, heart to heart
Left, right, left, we all fall down
Like toy soldiers
Bit by bit, torn apart
We never win, but the battle wages on
For toy soldiers

[Bridge: Eminem]
Feels like a close, it's coming to
Fuck am I gonna do?
It's too late to start over
This is the only thing I, thing I know

[Verse 1: Eminem]
Sometimes I feel like all I ever do is
Find different ways to word the same old song
Ever since I came along
From the day the song called 'Hi! My Name Is' dropped
Started thinking my name was Fault
'Cause any time things went wrong
I was the one who they would blame it on
The media made me the equivalent
Of a modern-day Genghis Khan
Tried to argue it was only entertainment, dog
Gangster? Nah, courageous balls
Had to change my style, they said I'm way too soft
And I sound like AZ and Nas, out came the claws
And the fangs been out since then
But up until the instant that I went against it
It was ingrained in me
That I wouldn't amount to a shit stain, I thought
No wonder I had to unlearn everything my brain was taught
"Do I really belong in this game?", I pondered
I just wanna play my part
Should I make waves or not?
So back and forth in my brain the tug of war wages on
And I don't wanna seem ungrateful
Or disrespect the art form I was raised upon
But sometimes you gotta take a loss
And have people rub it in your face
Before you get made pissed off
And keep plugging, it's your only outlet
And your only outfit, so you know they gonna talk about it
Better find a way to counter it quick and make it' ah
Feel like I've already said this a kabillion 80 times
How many times can I say the same thing
Different ways that rhyme?
What I really wanna say is, if there's anyone else that can relate to my story, bet you feel the same way I felt
When I was in the same place you are, when I was afraid to'

[Pre-Chorus: Sia]
I was a' afraid to make a single sound
Afraid I would never find a way out, out, out
Afraid I'd never be found
I didn't wanna go another round
An angry man's power will shut you up
Trip wires fill this house with tip-toed love
Run out of excuses for everyone
So here I am and I will not run

[Chorus: Sia]
Guts over fear, the time is near
Guts over fear, might shed a tear
For all the times I let you push me round
I let you keep me down
Now I got guts over fear, guts over fear

[Bridge: Eminem]
Feels like a close, it's coming to
Fuck am I gonna do?
It's too late to start over
This is the only thing I, thing I know

[Verse 2: Eminem]
I know what it was like, I was there once
Single parents, hate your appearance
As you struggle to find your place in this world
And the pain spawns all the anger on
But it wasn't 'til I put the pain in song
Learned who to aim it on that I made a spark
Started to spit harder shit
Learned how to harness it while the reins were off
And there was a lot of bizarre shit, but the crazy part
Was soon as I stopped saying I gave a fuck
Haters started to appreciate my art
And it just breaks my heart to look at all the pain I caused
But what am I gonna do when the rage is gone
And the lights go out in that trailer park
And the window is closing and there's nowhere else that I can go with flows and I'm frozen
'Cause there's no more emotion for me to pull from
Just a bunch of playful songs that I make for fun
So, to the break of dawn, here I go recycling the same old song
But I rather make 'Not Afraid 2'
Than make another motherfucking 'We Made You,' ah
Now, I don't wanna seem indulgent
When I discuss my lows and my highs
My demise and my uprise, pray to God
I just open enough eyes later on
And gave you the supplies and the tools
To hopefully use that'll make you strong
Enough to lift yourself up, when you feel like I felt
'Cause I can't explain to y'all how dang exhausted my legs felt
Just having to balance my dang self
When on eggshells, I was made to walk
But thank you, Ma, 'cause that gave me the
Strength to cause Shady-mania, so when they empty that stadium
Least I made it out of that house
And found a place in this world when the day was done
So this is for every kid who all's they ever did
Was dreamt of one day just getting accepted
I represent him or her, anyone similar
You are the reason that I made this song
And everything you're scared to say
Don't be afraid to say no more
From this day forward, just let them a-holes talk
Take it with a grain of salt'and eat their fucking faces off!
The legend of the angry blond
Lives on through you when I'm gone, and to think I was a'

[Pre-Chorus: Sia]
I was a' afraid to make a single sound
Afraid I would never find a way out, out, out
Afraid I'd never be found
I didn't wanna go another round
An angry man's power will shut you up
Trip wires fill this house with tip-toed love
Run out of excuses for everyone
So here I am and I will not run

[Chorus: Sia]
Guts over fear, the time is near
Guts over fear, might shed a tear
For all the times I let you push me round
I let you keep me down
Now I got guts over fear, guts over fear

[Intro: Eminem & Dina Rae]
Mhmmm *inhales*
You high, baby?
Yeah
Yeah?
Talk to me
You want me to tell you something?
Uh-huh
I know what you wanna hear

[Refrain: Eminem (& Dina Rae)]
'Cause I know you want me, baby, I think I want you too
(I think I love you, baby) I think I love you too
I'm here to save you, girl, come be in Shady's world
I wanna grow together, let's let our love unfurl
You know you want me, baby, you know I want you too
They call me Superman, I'm here to rescue you
I wanna save you, girl, come be in Shady's world
(Oh boy, you drive me crazy) Bitch, you make me hurl

[Verse 1: Eminem]
They call me Superman
Leap tall hoes in a single bound
I'm single now: got no ring on this finger now
I'd never let another chick bring me down
In a relationship; save it, bitch!
Babysit? You make me sick
Superman ain't savin' shit
Girl, you can jump on Shady's dick
Straight from the hip, cut to the chase
I tell a motherfuckin' slut to her face
Play no games, say no names
Ever since I broke up with what's-her-face
I'm a different man, kiss my ass
Kiss my lips? Bitch, why ask?
Kiss my dick, get my cash?
I'd rather have you whip my ass
Don't put out, I'll put you out
Won't get out, I'll push you out
Puss blew out, poppin' shit
Wouldn't piss on fire to put you out
Am I too nice? Buy you ice?
Bitch, if you died, wouldn't buy you life
What, you tryin' to be my new wife?
What, you Mariah? Fly through twice

[Pre-Chorus: Eminem]
But I do know one thing though
Bitches, they come, they go
Saturday through Sunday, Monday
Monday through Sunday, yo
Maybe I'll love you one day
Maybe we'll someday grow
'Til then just sit your drunk ass on that fuckin' runway, ho

[Chorus: Eminem]
'Cause I can't be your Superman, can't be your Superman
Can't be your Superman, can't be your Superman
I can't be your Superman, can't be your Superman
Can't be your Superman, your Superman, your Superman

[Verse 2: Eminem]
Don't get me wrong, I love these hoes
It's no secret, everybody knows
Yeah, we fucked: bitch, so what?
That's about as far as your buddy goes
We'll be friends, I'll call you again
I'll chase you around every bar you attend
Never know what kinda car I'll be in
We'll see how much you be'll partyin' then
You don't want that, neither do I
I don't wanna flip when I see you with guys
Too much pride, between you and I
Not a jealous man, but females lie
But I guess that's just what sluts do
How could it ever be just us two?
I'd never love you enough to trust you
We just met and I just fucked you

[Pre-Chorus: Eminem]
But I do know one thing though
Bitches, they come, they go
Saturday through Sunday, Monday
Monday through Sunday, yo
Maybe I'll love you one day
Maybe we'll someday grow
'Til then just sit your drunk ass on that fuckin' runway, ho

[Chorus: Eminem]
'Cause I can't be your Superman, can't be your Superman
Can't be your Superman, can't be your Superman
I can't be your Superman, can't be your Superman
Can't be your Superman, your Superman, your Superman
'Cause I can't be your Superman, can't be your Superman
Can't be your Superman, can't be your Superman
I can't be your Superman, can't be your Superman
Can't be your Superman, your Superman, your Superman

[Refrain: Eminem (& Dina Rae)]
'Cause I know you want me, baby, I think I want you too
(I think I love you, baby) I think I love you too
I'm here to save you, girl, come be in Shady's world
I wanna grow together, let's let our love unfurl
You know you want me, baby, you know I want you too
They call me Superman, I'm here to rescue you
I wanna save you, girl, come be in Shady's world
(Oh boy, you drive me crazy) Bitch, you make me hurl

[Verse 3: Eminem]
First thing you say: I'm not fazed
I hang around big stars all day
I don't see what the big deal is anyway
You're just plain old Marshall to me
Ooh yeah, girl, run that game
Hailie Jade, I love that name
Love that tattoo, what's that say?
"Rot In Pieces," uh, that's great
First off, you don't know Marshall
At all, so don't grow partial
That's ammo for my arsenal
I'll slap you off that bar stool
There goes another lawsuit
Leave handprints all across you
Good Lordy, whoadie
You must be gone off that water bottle
You want what you can't have
Ooh girl, that's too damn bad
Don't touch what you can't grab
End up with two backhands
Put anthrax on a Tampax
And slap you 'til you can't stand
Girl, you just blew your chance
Don't mean to ruin your plans

[Pre-Chorus: Eminem]
But I do know one thing though
Bitches, they come, they go
Saturday through Sunday, Monday
Monday through Sunday, yo
Maybe I'll love you one day
Maybe we'll someday grow
'Til then just sit your drunk ass on that fuckin' runway, ho

[Chorus: Eminem]
'Cause I can't be your Superman, can't be your Superman
Can't be your Superman, can't be your Superman
I can't be your Superman, can't be your Superman
Can't be your Superman, your Superman, your Superman
'Cause I can't be your Superman, can't be your Superman
Can't be your Superman, can't be your Superman
I can't be your Superman, can't be your Superman
Can't be your Superman, your Superman, your Superman

[Refrain: Eminem (& Dina Rae)]
'Cause I know you want me, baby, I think I want you too
(I think I love you, baby) I think I love you too
I'm here to save you, girl, come be in Shady's world
I wanna grow together, let's let our love unfurl
You know you want me, baby, you know I want you too
They call me Superman, I'm here to rescue you
I wanna save you, girl, come be in Shady's world
(Oh boy, you drive me crazy) Bitch, you make me hurl

[Chorus: Eminem]
'Cause I can't be your Superman, can't be your Superman
Can't be your Superman, can't be your Superman
I can't be your Superman, can't be your Superman
Can't be your Superman, your Superman, your Superman
'Cause I can't be your Superman, can't be your Superman
Can't be your Superman, can't be your Superman
I can't be your Superman, can't be your Superman
Can't be your Superman, your Superman, your Superman

[Verse 1: Eminem]
These ideas are nightmares to white parents
Whose worst fear is a child with dyed hair and who likes earrings
Like whatever they say has no bearing
It's so scary in a house that allows no swearing
To see him walkin' around with his headphones blarin'
Alone in his own zone, cold and he don't care, he's
A problem child, and what bothers him all comes out
When he talks about his fuckin' dad walkin' out (Bitch!)
'Cause he hates him so bad that he blocks him out
If he ever saw him again he'd probably knock him out
His thoughts are wacked, he's mad so he's talkin' back
Talkin' black, brainwashed from rock and rap
He sags his pants, do-rags and a stockin' cap
His step-father hit him so he socked him back
And broke his nose, his house is a broken home
There's no control, he just lets his emotions go

[Chorus: Steven Tyler (& Eminem)]
(Come on!) Sing with me (Sing!), sing for the year (Sing it!)
Sing for the laughter and sing for the tear (Come on!)
Sing it with me, it's just for today
Maybe tomorrow the good Lord will take you away

[Verse 2: Eminem]
Entertainment is changin', intertwinin' with gangsters
In the land of the killers a sinner's mind is a sanctum
Holy or unholy, only have one homie
Only this gun, lonely 'cause don't anyone know me
Yet everybody just feels like they can relate (Huh-uh)
I guess words are a motherfucker, they can be great
Or they can degrade, or even worse, they can teach hate
It's like these kids hang on every single statement we make
Like they worship us, plus all the stores ship us platinum
Now how the fuck did this metamorphosis happen?
From standin' on corners and porches just rappin'
To havin' a fortune, no more kissin' ass
But then these critics crucify you (Yep), journalists try to burn you
Fans turn on you, attorneys all want a turn at you
To get they hands on every dime you have
They want you to lose your mind every time you mad
So they can try to make you out to look like a loose cannon
Any dispute won't hesitate to produce handguns
That's why these prosecutors wanna convict me
Strictly just to get me off of these streets quickly
But all they kids be listenin' to me religiously
So I'm signin' CDs while police fingerprint me
They're for the judge's daughter, but his grudge is against me
If I'm such a fuckin' menace, this shit doesn't make sense, B
It's all political, if my music is literal
And I'm a criminal, how the fuck can I raise a little girl?
I couldn't, I wouldn't be fit to
You're full of shit too, Guerrera, that was a fist that hit you! (Bitch!)

[Chorus: Steven Tyler (& Eminem)]
(Come on!) Sing with me (Sing!), sing for the year (Sing it!)
Sing for the laughter and sing for the tear (Sing that shit!)
Sing it with me, it's just for today
Maybe tomorrow the good Lord will take you away

[Verse 3: Eminem]
They say music can alter moods and talk to you
Well, can it load a gun up for you and cock it too?
Well, if it can, then the next time you assault a dude
Just tell the judge it was my fault and I'll get sued
See, what these kids do is hear about us totin' pistols
And they wanna get one 'cause they think the shit's cool
Not knowin' we really just protectin' ourselves
We entertainers, of course the shit's affectin' our sales
You ignoramus, but music is reflection of self
We just explain it, and then we get our checks in the mail
It's fucked up, ain't it? How we can come from practically nothin'
To bein' able to have any fuckin' thing that we wanted
That's why we sing for these kids who don't have a thing
Except for a dream and a fuckin' rap magazine (Ha-ha!)
Who post pin-up pictures on they walls all day long
Idolize they favorite rappers and know all they songs
Or for anyone who's ever been through shit in they lives
So they sit and they cry at night, wishin' they'd die
'Til they throw on a rap record and they sit and they vibe
We're nothin' to you, but we're the fuckin' shit in they eyes
That's why we seize the moment, try to freeze it and own it
Squeeze it and hold it 'cause we consider these minutes golden
And maybe they'll admit it when we're gone, just let our spirits
Live on through our lyrics that you hear in our songs, and we can'

[Chorus: Steven Tyler (& Eminem)]
Sing with me (Sing!), sing for the year (Sing it!)
Sing for the laughter and sing for the tear (Come on!)
Sing it with me, it's just for today
Maybe tomorrow the good Lord will take you away

[Chorus: Steven Tyler (& Eminem)]
Sing with me (Sing!), sing for the year (Sing it!)
Sing for the laughter and sing for the tear (Come on!)
Sing it with me, it's just for today
Maybe tomorrow the good Lord will take you away

[Chorus]
Feels like we're on the edge right now
I wish that I could say I'm proud
I'm sorry that I let you down
Let you down
All these voices in my head get loud
I wish that I could shut them out
I'm sorry that I let you down
Le-le-let you down

[Verse 1]
Yeah, I guess I'm a disappointment, doin' everything I can
I don't wanna make you disappointed, it's annoying
I just wanna make you feel like everything I ever do
Was never tryna make an issue for you, but I guess the more you
Thought about everything you were never even wrong
In the first place, right? Yeah, I'ma just ignore you
Walking towards you with my head down
Lookin' at the ground, I'm embarrassed for you
Paranoia, what did I do wrong this time?
That's parents for you
Very loyal? Shoulda had my back
But you put a knife in it'my hands are full
What else should I carry for you?
I cared for you, but'

[Chorus]
Feels like we're on the edge right now
I wish that I could say I'm proud
I'm sorry that I let you down
Le-le-let you down
All these voices in my head get loud
I wish that I could shut them out
I'm sorry that I let you down
Le-le-let you down

[Verse 2]
Yeah, you don't wanna make this work
You just wanna make this worse
Want me to listen to you, but you don't ever hear my words
You don't wanna know my hurt, yeah
Let me guess, you want an apology, probably
How can we keep going at a rate like this?
We can't, so I guess I'ma have to leave
Please, don't come after me
I just wanna be alone right now, I don't really wanna think at all
Go ahead, just drink it off
Both know you're gonna call tomorrow like nothing's wrong
Ain't that what you always do?
I feel like every time I talk to you, you're in an awful mood
What else can I offer you?
There's nothing left right now, I gave it all to you

[Chorus]
Feels like we're on the edge right now
I wish that I could say I'm proud
I'm sorry that I let you down
Le-le-let you down
All these voices in my head get loud
I wish that I could shut them out
I'm sorry that I let you down
Le-le-let you down

[Verse 3]
Yeah, don't talk down to me
That's not gonna work now
Packed all my clothes and I moved out
I don't even wanna go to your house
Every time I sit on that couch
I feel like you lecture me, eventually, I bet that we
Coulda made this work
And prolly woulda figured things out
But I guess I'm a letdown
But it's cool, I checked out
Oh, you wanna be friends now?
Okay, let's put my fake face on and pretend now
Sit around and talk about the good times that didn't even happen
I mean, why are you laughing?
Must have missed that joke, let me see if I can find a reaction
No, but at least you're happy

[Chorus]
Feels like we're on the edge right now
I wish that I could say I'm proud
I'm sorry that I let you down
Oh, I let you down
All these voices in my head get loud
And I wish that I could shut them out
I'm sorry that I let you down
Oh, let you down

[Outro]
I'm sorry
I'm so sorry now
Yeah, I'm sorry that I let you down

[Verse]
"Hey, Nate, how's life?"
I don't know, it's alright
I've been dealin' with some things like every human being
And really didn't sleep much last night
"I'm sorry," that's fine
I just think I need a little me time
I just think I need a little free time
Little break from the shows and the bus rides, yeah
Last year I had a breakdown
Thoughts tellin' me I'm lost gettin' too loud
Had to see a therapist, then I found out
Somethin' funny's goin' on up in my house
Yeah, I started thinkin' maybe I should move out
You know, pack my cart, take a new route
Clean up my yard, get the noose out
Hang up my heart, let it air out
I've been searchin'
"What does that mean, Nate?" I've been learning
Grabbin' my keepsakes, leavin' my burdens
Well, I brought a few with me, I'm not perfect
Lookin' at the view, like this concerns me
Pickin' up the cues, right? I'm quite nervous
Hate it when I lose sight, life gets blurry
And things might hurt me
It's prolly gonna be a long journey, but hey
It's worth it, though
Cold world out there, kids, grab your coats
It's been a minute, I know, now I'm back to roam
Lookin' for the antidote to crack the code
Pretty vivid; I admit it, I'm in classic mode
Don't need pity given to me, but I can't condone
Talkin' down to me, I'ma have to crack your nose for crackin' jokes
I'm lookin' for the map to hope, you seen it?
Been makin' a whole lot of changes
Wrote a song about that, you should play it
I get scared when I walk on these stages
I look at the crowd and see so many faces, yeah
That's when I start to get anxious
That's when my thoughts can be dangerous
That's when I put on my makeup and drown in self-hatred
Forget what I'm saying, and'
Where'd the beat go?
Oh, ain't that somethin'?
Drums came in, you ain't see that comin'
Hands on my head, can't tell me nothin'
Got a taste of the fame, had to pump my stomach
Throw it back up like I don't want it
Wipe my face, clean off my vomit
OCD, tryna push my buttons
I said don't touch it, now y'all done it
I can be critical, never typical
Intricate with every syllable, I'm a criminal
Intimate, but never political, pretty visual
Even if you hate it, I'll make it feel like you're in it, though
You call me what you wanna, but never call me forgettable
Leave you deep in thought, I could never swim in the kiddie pool
Way that I been thinkin' is cinematic, it's beautiful
Man, I don't know if I'm makin' movies or music videos (Videos, videos)
Yeah, the sales can rise
Doesn't mean much though when your health declines
See, we've all got somethin' that we trapped inside
That we try to suffocate, you know, hopin' it dies
Try to hold it underwater but it always survives
Then it comes up out of nowhere like an evil surprise
Then it hovers over you to tell you millions of lies
You don't relate to that? Must not be as crazy as I am
The point I'm makin' is the mind is a powerful place
And what you feed it can affect you in a powerful way
It's pretty cool, right? Yeah, but it's not always safe
Just hang with me, this'll only take a moment, okay?
Just think about it for a second, if you look at your face
Every day when you get up and think you'll never be great
You'll never be great'not because you're not, but the hate
Will always find a way to cut you up and murder your faith (Woo)
I've been developin', take a look at the benefits
Nothin' to meddle with, I can never be delicate
Am I even relevant? That depends how you measure it
Take a measurement, then bag it up and give me the evidence
Pretty evident; dependable can never be tentative
I'm a gentleman, depending on if I think you're genuine
Pretty elegant, but not afraid to tell you to get a grip
Proper etiquette, I keep it to myself when I celebrate, ah
It's that time again
Better grab your balloons and invite your friends
Seatbelts back on, yeah, strap 'em in
Look at me, everybody, I'm smilin' big
On a road right now that I can't predict
Tell me "Tone that down," but I can't resist
Y'all know that sound, better raise your fist
The search begins, I'm back, so enjoy the trip, huh

[Chorus]
I heard you told your friends that I'm just not your type
If that's how you really feel, then why'd you call last night?
You say all I ever do is just control your life
But how you gonna lie like that, how you gonna lie like that?

[Verse 1]
Yeah, I heard you said I ain't the type for you
I don't regret it though, I learned from it
They should have you locked up for all the time you stole from us (Woo)
Took you out when I had no money
Only person that you ever cared about was you, that's why it's so funny
You want somebody that'll keep you warm at night
Then, tell me, why you actin' cold to me?
You ain't the only one to blame, no, I'm the one that made you rich
When I bought every lie you sold to me
Yeah, heard you threw away the pictures
But you still got the memories of us
So I guess I don't really make a difference
Flippin' through 'em in your head
Got you texting me all hours of the night
Yeah, you told me that you needed distance
What's the deal with you?
You say you want a man that keeps it real
Then why you mad when I get real with you?
You want someone to pay the bills for you
Went from feelin' you, now I feel for you, liar

[Chorus]
I heard you told your friends that I'm just not your type
If that's how you really feel, then why'd you call last night?
You say all I ever do is just control your life
But how you gonna lie like that, how you gonna lie like that?

[Verse 2]
Look, let me guess, you want to stay friends?
Tellin' people that's how we been?
Tellin' everybody, yeah, that we was barely speakin'
Ah, that's kinda funny, why'd you call me every day then?
It's immaturity, you goin' off the deep end
You just want somebody you can chill and get some drinks with, cool
Then don't hit me on the weekend
Tellin' me you missed the way we talked and how I listen, yeah
Why you playin' with my mind, huh?
Why you playin' with my time, huh?
Told me, "We should let it go and put it all behind us"
That's what I did, now you askin' me what I done, I was
Waitin' for this day, I saw it comin'
I think you just like attention, tryna tell me all your problems
I got issues of my own, I ain't got time for all this drama
You told me that you don't really wanna talk'then why you callin', huh?

[Chorus]
I heard you told your friends that I'm just not your type
If that's how you really feel, then why'd you call last night?
You say all I ever do is just control your life
But how you gonna lie like that, how you gonna lie like that?

[Bridge]
How you gonna lie, how you gonna lie like that?
Baby, how you gonna lie, how you gonna lie like that?
How you gonna lie, baby, how you gonna lie like that?
No, no, how you gonna lie like that?

[Chorus]
I heard you told your friends that I'm just not your type
(Baby, how you gonna lie like that? No, no)
If that's how you really feel, then why'd you call last night?
(Tell me how you 'bout to lie like that)
You say all I ever do is just control your life
(No, no, no)
But how you gonna lie like that, how you gonna lie like that?
(Oh, yeah)

[Outro]
Tell me how you 'bout to lie like that
Tell me how you 'bout to lie like'
Yeah, yeah, hey

[Verse 1]
Yeah, when I grow up, you know what I wanna be?
Take a seat, let me tell you my ridiculous dreams
I wanna rap, yeah, I know it's hard to believe
And I can tell you're already thinkin' I will never succeed
But I'm okay with it, I admit the lyrics are weak
I've been workin' on 'em, I'll be good eventually
I understand you gotta crawl before you get to your feet
But I been running for a while, they ain't ready for me, ahh
I know this prolly isn't really realistic
And honestly, I might not ever make a difference
But that don't make a difference, I'ma have to risk it
I've been crunchin' numbers, you ain't gotta be a mathematician
To see the odds ain't rootin' for me
I can't lie though, it's kinda how I like it to be
The underdog, yeah, you prolly think you know what I mean
But what I'm saying is they ever push me, I'm gonna swing, yeah
I could go to college, get in debt like everybody else
Graduate and prolly get a job that doesn't pay the bills
That don't make a lot of sense to me, forget the Happy Meals
I don't like the dollar menu, I would rather make a meal
Huh? Make a mil'? Nah, I said make a meal
Home-cookin', get the grill, how you want it? Pretty well?
Everything I see is overdone to me, I'm not Adele
But I'ma get a record deal and say hello to mass appeal

[Chorus]
When I grow up, I just want to pay my bills
Rappin' about the way I feel (Oh, yeah)
I just want to make a couple mil'
Leave it to the fam in the will (Oh, yeah)
I just want to sign a record deal
Maybe buy a house up in the hills (Oh, yeah)
Might not be the best in my field
But I guarantee that I'ma die real
When I grow up

[Post-Chorus]
Yeah, ayy
When I grow up
Yeah, yeah, ayy

[Verse 2]
I'ma make 'em notice me, rhymin' like it's poetry
Everything I oversee, I just like to overthink
Mockin' me, you pay the fee, no return and no receipts
Those of you that don't believe, quiet, you don't know a thing
Quiet when I'm tryna sing, quiet when I'm making beats
Quiet when I'm tryna think, sorry, I don't mean to scream
I just feel like no one really gets me and it's sad to see
'Cause someday I'ma grow up and show all of you it's meant to be (Yeah)
Anybody wanna hear me rap? "No"
Come on, let me play a couple tracks, "No"
Come on, I can spit it really fast, "No"
You think I should throw this in the trash? "No"
Tricked ya; haters, go away before I hit ya
I am not a beggar or a kiss-up
You don't understand? Well, I forgive ya
I am not a quitter, you ain't really think that, did ya?
Maybe someday I could even be up on the radio
Have a tour bus and maybe even play a couple shows
Everybody in the crowd singing every word I wrote
Tellin' me that I am not the only one that feels alone
Huh? You feel alone? Yeah, I kinda feel alone
Wonder if that feelin' ever goes away when you get old
Will I ever make it as an artist? I don't really know
Might not make a lot of dough
I'ma have to try it, though

[Chorus]
When I grow up
I just wanna pay my bills
Rappin' about the way I feel (Oh, yeah)
I just wanna make a couple mil'
Leave it to the fam in the will (Oh, yeah)
(Leave it to the fam in the will)
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
I just wanna sign a record deal
Maybe buy a house up in the hills (Okay, oh, yeah)
Might not be the best in my field (Ayy, ayy, yeah)
But I guarantee that I'ma die real
When I grow up
I just wanna pay my bills (Woo)
Rappin' about the way I feel (Oh, yeah)
(Yeah, the way I feel)
Yeah, I just wanna make a couple mil' (Ayy, couple mil')
Leave it to the fam in the will (Oh, yeah, to the fam in the will)
I just wanna sign a record deal (Woo)
Maybe buy a house up in the hills (Oh, yeah)
(House up in the hills)
Yeah, I might not be the best in my field
But I guarantee that I'ma die real
When I grow up
When I grow up

[Intro]
Too many faces, too many faces, too many faces

[Verse]
Yeah, what's your definition of success? (Ayy)
I don't trust the thoughts that come inside my head (Woo)
I don't trust this thing that beats inside my chest
Who I am and who I wanna be cannot connect; why?
Don't think I deserve it? You get no respect (Woo)
I just made a couple mil', still not impressed
"Let You Down" goes triple platinum, yeah, okay, okay, I guess (Ayy)
Smile for a moment then these questions startin' to fill my head, not again!
I push away the people that I love the most; why? (Woo)
I don't want no one to know I'm vulnerable; why? (Woo)
That makes me feel weak and so uncomfortable; why? (Ayy)
Stop askin' me questions, I just wanna feel alive
Until I die'this isn't Nate's flow (Woo)
Just let me rhyme; I'm in disguise
I'm a busy person, got no time for lies; one of a kind
They don't see it; I pull out they eyes; I'm on the rise!
I've been doin' this for most my life with no advice (Woo)
Take my chances, I just roll the dice, do what I like
As a kid, I was afraid of heights, put that aside
Now I'm here and they look so surprised, well so am I, woo
They don't invite me to the parties, but I still arrive
Kick down the door and then I go inside
Give off that "I do not belong here" vibe
Then take the keys right off the counter, let's go for a ride
Why do y'all look mortified? (Ayy)
I keep to myself, they think I'm sorta shy, organized
"Let You Down's" the only song you've heard of? Well then you're behind (Woo)
Story time; wish that I could think like Big Sean does, but I just can't decide (aah!)
If I should stick my knife inside of Pennywise
I, I don't care what anybody else thinks'lies (Haha)
I do not need nobody to help me'lies
I kinda feel guilty 'cause I'm wealthy; why?
I don't understand, it's got me questionin' like
"Why? Just tell me why"'not back to this flow
Inside I feel divided
Back when I ain't had a dime, but had the drive
Back before I ever signed, I questioned life, like, "Who am I, man?" Woo
Nothin' to me's ever good enough
I could be workin' for 24 hours a day and think I never did enough
My life is a movie, but there ain't no tellin' what you're gonna see in my cinema (No)
I wanna be great, but I get in the way of myself and I think about everything that I could never be
Why do I do it though? Ayy, yeah
Why you always lookin' aggravated?
Not a choice, you know I had to make it
When they talk about the greatest, they gon' probably never put us in the conversation
Like somethin', then I gotta take it
Write somethin', then I might erase it
I love it, then I really hate it
What's the problem, Nathan? I don't know!
I know I like to preach to always be yourself (Yeah)
But my emotions make me feel like I am someone else
Me and pride had made a pact that we don't need no help
Which feels like I'm at war inside myself, but I forgot the shells
I hold my issues up for all to see, like show and tell
A lot of people know me, but not a lot know me well
Hold my issues up for all to see, like show and tell
A lot of people know me, but they don't know me well

[Outro]
Too many faces, too many faces, too many faces

[Intro]
(Yeah)
Hey!
Leave me alone

[Verse 1]
Panic-stricken, handle business, not a joke, yeah
Manners missin', travel different, no control, yeah
Time to listen, time to zip it, keep it closed
My description, highly gifted, take some notes, yeah
Lack of interest, why'd you visit? Hit the road, yeah
I'm kinda twisted, so keep your distance, be a ghost
Yeah, see I'm inventive, but quite the menace, you ain't know?
Well then I'm offended, let's jog your memories, here we go, yeah
I went from nobody to kinda famous
Hide my plaques inside the closet, I just can't explain it
My wife, she tells me that she's proud and thinks that I should hang 'em
But I just leave 'em on the ground right next to my self-hatred
Yeah, yeah, mental health, where's my mental health?
Diagnosed with OCD, what does that mean? Well, gather 'round
That means I obsessively obsess on things I think about
That means I might take a normal thought and think it's so profound (Leave me alone)
Ruminating, fill balloons up full of doubts
Do the same things, if I don't, I'm overwhelmed (Leave me alone)
Thoughts are pacing, they go 'round and 'round and 'round
It's so draining, let's move onto something else, fine (Oh) (Leave me alone)
Runnin' the game, but they don't even know it
Like I'm undercover and don't wanna blow it
I come out of nowhere, they don't even notice
The flow is so cold, you would think it was snowin' (Oh) (Leave me alone)
I'm under the weather, but wind isn't blowin'
I got an umbrella for difficult moments
You got to admit it, I'm very devoted
I'm out in the rain, but it don't always open, so I' (I, I)

[Pre-Chorus]
Hold up my balloons and cover up my face
I can feel them weighin' on me every day
I should let 'em go and watch 'em float away
But I'm scared if I do, then I'll be more afraid (More afraid)
Tell them how I feel, but they don't wanna change (Don't wanna change)
Tell them how I feel, but they remain the same (Same)
Loosen up my grip, they say that's not okay
Quiet, quiet, quiet, quiet, quiet, ayy, leave me alone! (Oh!)

[Chorus]
Ayy, yeah
Quiet, quiet, quiet, quiet, ayy (Yeah), leave me alone!
Woo, yeah
Quiet, quiet, quiet, quiet, ayy (Yeah), leave me alone! (Leave me alone)

[Verse 2]
I hate when they debate if we're underrated
We're so overlooked that they're lookin' over our numbers, Nathan (Leave me alone)
We don't do enough interviews or go out in public lately
We don't post enough on our socials
To keep the buzz from fading (Leave me alone)
Let it fade, yeah, let it fade
Once it's decimated, then you drop a song outta nowhere
And all the fans embrace it (Leave me alone)
Then the buzz will surface again, it's part of my operation
I don't need advice from my doubts right now
End of conversation (Leave me alone)
Shut your mouth, yeah, shut your mouth
Better tone it down, close it now
If you make a sound, I'ma change the dial (Leave me alone)
Funny how they be acting loud, comin' unannounced
It's floating 'round
Man, the kid is wild, pretty vile, true (Leave me alone)
I'm kinda funny but don't really show it
I keep it together but have a disorder
I go to my room and I sit in my corner
And talk to myself in a language that's foreign (Leave me alone)
I think of a rhyme and I have to record it
But know if I don't, I'll wake up in the mornin'
And question my life again, always avoiding
I hate to be different, but hate to be normal, so I... (Leave me alone)

[Pre-Chorus]
Hold up my balloons and cover up my face
I can feel them weighin' on me every day
I should let 'em go and watch 'em float away
But I'm scared if I do, then I'll be more afraid
Tell them how I feel, but they don't wanna change (Wanna change)
Tell them how I feel but they remain the same (They remain the same)
Loosen up my grip, they say that's not okay
Quiet, quiet, quiet, quiet, quiet, ayy
Leave me alone!

[Chorus]
Ayy, yeah
Quiet, quiet, quiet, quiet, ayy (Yeah), leave me alone!
Woo, yeah
Quiet, quiet, quiet, quiet, ayy (Yeah), leave me alone!

[Verse 3]
Remember back in "NO NAME," I said fame called? (Yeah, yeah)
Told you I hung up, it kinda felt wrong (Leave me alone) (Wrong, wrong)
Finally called him back, we didn't talk long (No)
He asked me how I'd been, I sent him this song (Leave me alone, quiet, quiet, quiet)
Yeah, think he took offense, he kinda seemed off (Off)
I texted him that night to ask what he thought (Leave me alone, quiet, quiet, quiet)
It took a couple days to get a response
But once I finally did, he said this song sucks (Leave me alone, quiet, quiet, quiet)
Feel the symptoms, couldn't miss 'em, wrestle with 'em
Then I pin and flip 'em, brought some back up
No, well, you should get some (Leave me alone, quiet, quiet, quiet)
Who you dissin'? Mood is switchin', don't come in the kitchen
You should listen, cookin' record for my hands are blisterin'
So persistent, don't forget this, hold the tension, soul is bendin'
No pretendin', open-ended, low percentage, so demented (Leave me alone)
Whole consensus, flow tremendous, no apprentice, dope incentive
Show intensive, so possessive, tone aggressive, watch your step when I... (Leave me alone)

[Pre-Chorus]
Hold up my balloons and cover up my face (Up my face)
I can feel them weighin' on me every day (Yeah, every day)
I should let 'em go and watch them float away (Yeah, float away)
But I'm scared if I do then I'll be more afraid
Leave me alone (Yeah), leave me alone, yeah (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Leave me alone, leave me alone (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Leave me alone, leave me alone (Yeah, leave me alone)
Yeah, leave me alone, leave me alone, ayy, leave me alone!

[Chorus]
Ayy, yeah
Quiet, quiet, quiet, quiet, ayy (Yeah), leave me alone!
Woo, yeah
Quiet, quiet, quiet, quiet, ayy (Yeah), leave me alone!
Ayy, yeah
Quiet, quiet, quiet, quiet, ayy (Yeah), leave me alone!
Woo, yeah
Quiet, quiet, quiet, quiet, ayy
Leave me alone

[Verse 1]
I just need some time; I'm tryna think straight
I just need a moment in my own space
Ask me how I'm doin', I say "okay," yeah
But ain't that what we all say?
Sometimes I think back to the old days
In the pointless conversations with the old me
Yeah, back when my momma used to hold me
I wish somebody woulda told me

[Chorus]
If you want love, you gon' have to go through the pain
If you want love, you gon' have to learn how to change
If you want trust, you gon' have to give some away
If you want love, if you want love

[Verse 2]
Yeah, as a kid I used to think life
Is moving so slow, I watch it go by
Look out the window on my bus ride
I thought the world was so small, through my closed eyes
I've always tried to control things
In the end that's what controls me
Maybe that's why I'm controllin'
I wish somebody woulda told me

[Chorus]
If you want love, you gon' have to go through the pain
If you want love, you gon' have to learn how to change
If you want trust, you gon' have to give some away
If you want love, if you want love

[Verse 3]
The older I get, I feel like I'm always tryna save time
Talkin' to the voices in my head, they make me think twice
Tellin' me it doesn't mean it's wrong because it feels right
I'm scared that one day I'll wake up and wonder where'd the time go
Talk about the past like it's the present while I rock slow
I'll sit in the living room and laugh with kids of my own
And tell 'em

[Chorus]
If you want love, you gon' have to go through the pain
I wish you woulda told me
If you want love, you gon' have to learn how to change
I wish somebody woulda told me
If you want trust, you gon' have to give some away
You gon' have to give
If you want love, if you want love
If you want love, if you want love

[Intro]
How could you leave so unexpected?
We waited, we waited
For you, but you just left us
We needed you, I needed you

[Verse 1]
Yo, I don't know what it's like to be addicted to pills
But I do know what it's like to be a witness, it kills
Mama told me she loved me, I'm thinkin' this isn't real
I think of you when I get a whiff of that cigarette smell, yeah
Welcome to the bottom of hell
They say pain is a prison, let me out of my cell
You say you proud of me, but you don't know me that well
Sit in my room, tears runnin' down my face and I yell
Into my pillowcases, say you comin' to get us
Then call a minute later just to tell us you're not, I'm humiliated
I'm in a room with a parent that I don't barely know
Some lady in the corner watchin' us while she's takin' notes
I don't get it, Mom, don't you want to watch your babies grow?
I guess pills are more important, all you have to say is "no"
But you won't do it, will you? You gon' keep poppin' 'til them pills kill you
I know you're gone, but I can still feel you

[Chorus]
Why would you leave us? Why would you leave us?
How could you leave us here?
How could you leave us? Why would you leave us? Oh
Hey

[Verse 2]
I got this picture in my room and it kills me
But I don't need a picture of my mom, I need the real thing
Now a relationship is somethin' we won't ever have
But why do I feel like I lost somethin' that I never had?
You shoulda been there when I graduated
Told me you loved me and congratulations
Instead you left us at the window waitin'
Where you at mom?
We're too young to understand, where you at, huh?
Yeah, I know them drugs have got you held captive
I can see it in your eyes, they got your mind captured
Some say it's fun to get the high, but I am not laughin'
And what you don't realize and what you're not graspin'
That I was nothin' but a kid who couldn't understand it
I ain't gon' say that I forgive you 'cause it hasn't happened
I thought that maybe I'd feel better as time passes
If you really cared for me, then where you at then?

[Chorus]
Why would you leave us? Why would you leave us?
How could you leave us here?
How could you leave us? Why would you leave us? Oh
Hey

[Verse 3]
Our last conversation, you and I sat in the livin' room
Talkin' 'bout my music and I brought you some to listen to
You started cryin', tellin' me this isn't you
A couple weeks later, guess you were singin' a different tune
You took them pills for the last time, didn't you?
They took you from us once, I guess they came back to finish you
Cryin' my eyes out in the studio is difficult
Music is the only place that I can go to speak to you
It took everything inside of me, not to scream at your funeral
Sittin' in my chair, that person talkin' was pitiful
I wish you were here, mama, but every time I picture you
All I feel is pain, I hate the way I remember you
They found you on the floor, I could tell you felt hollow
Gave everything you had, plus your life to them pill bottles
You gave everything you had, plus your life to them pill bottles
Don't know if you hear me or not, but if you're still watchin', why?

[Chorus]
Why would you leave us? Why would you leave us?
How could you leave us here?
How could you leave us? Why would you leave us? Oh
Hey

[Outro]
Sometimes I think about like...
Sometimes I think about things like, you know
When I'd have kids, I'm like...
You won't be there, you know?
You won't be there for any of that
And I'll never get to see you again
Sometimes I wish I would've just called you
I wish I would have just picked up the phone
Wish you were here
I mean you should've been there for us
You should have been here!
Them pills got you, right?!
Them pills got you, right?!
I wish you were here

[Chorus]
Yeah, they say when you grow up
You'll understand when you're older
Guess I'm still a kid, I don't know if
If I'll ever let go of this (Yeah)
Say goodbye to the old me
We ain't friends anymore, you don't know me (Real music)
I know I could die any moment
If I do just remember this

[Verse 1]
Yeah, handouts create lazy people I'm not impressed with
You want something in life, then why don't you go and get it?
Actions speak louder than words do, it's pretty quiet, isn't it?
Look at the world we live in, defined by comment sections (Whoa)
Surround yourself with people that challenge how you think
Not people that nod their head and act like they agree
Those people will cut you open just to watch you bleed
Always be yourself, not the person that you pretend to be, no!
These people gon' tell you that you won't ever make it
Then when you do, they gon' say they knew you were goin' places
That's just how it works, next thing you know you'll be overrated
Hearing people say they miss the "old you," it's crazy, ain't it?
And perfect people don't exist, so don't pretend to be one
I don't need pats on the back from people for my achievements
When I die I wanna know that I lived for a reason
Anyone can take your life, but not what you believe in; no

[Chorus]
Yeah, they say when you grow up
You'll understand when you're older
Guess I'm still a kid, I don't know if
If I'll ever let go of this
Say goodbye to the old me
We ain't friends anymore, you don't know me
I know I could die any moment
If I do just remember this

[Verse 2]
Yeah, don't take opinions from people that won't listen to yours
If money's where you find happiness, you'll always be poor
If you don't like the job you have, then what do you do it for?
The cure to pain isn't something you buy at liquor stores, nah
The real you is not defined by the size of your office
The real you is who you are when ain't nobody watchin'
You spend your whole life worried about what's in your wallet
For what? That money won't show up in your coffin, woo!
Yeah, anger's a liar, he ain't got no respect
I fell in love with my pain and I slept with my regrets
Happiness saw it happen, maybe that's why she up and left
Joy called me a cheater, said she ain't coming back
I've always had a problem with relationships
But that's what happens when you see the world through a broken lens
Mistakes can make you grow, that doesn't mean you're friends
Who you are is up to you, don't leave it up to them, no

[Chorus]
Yeah, they say when you grow up
You'll understand when you're older
Guess I'm still a kid, I don't know if
If I'll ever let go of this
Say goodbye to the old me
We ain't friends anymore, you don't know me
I know I could die any moment
If I do just remember this

[Verse 3]
Yeah, they say you got into music, you signed up to be hated
That's kinda weird 'cause I don't remember signing my name up
Coming from people that give advice but never take none
I like my privacy, but, lately, I feel it's invaded
I heard that life's too short, don't let it pass you by
We waste a lot of time crying over wasted time
It's not about what people think, it's how you feel inside
My biggest failures in life are knowing I never tried, woo!
I look at the world from a different angle
People change; even Satan used to be an angel
Think twice before you're bitin' on the hand that made you
Don't believe what you believe just 'cause that's how they raised you
Think your own thoughts, don't let them do it for you
Say you want a drink, don't wait for people to pour it on you
Cut out the liars, stay close to people you know are loyal
Grab your own glass and fill it, don't let your fear destroy you, woo!

[Chorus]
Even if we both break down tonight
And you say you hate me, and we go to bed angry
I know everything will be alright
I'll be here waiting, I promise I'm changing
I just need...

[Verse 1]
A little time to show you I'm worth it
I know that I can be a difficult person
I'm a stress case, drive you up the wall when I'm workin'
Actually, I'm probably worse when I'm not, you don't deserve it
Make you nervous 'cause you know I'ma break soon
Every time I do, I say somethin' that hurts you
Actin' like I'm gone, but we both in the same room
I don't like to be wrong, which I know you relate to
And I know I make you feel like you're at the end of your rope
That's when I look at you and tell you I'd be better alone
Just the pride talkin', isn't it? 'Cause both of us know
I'm the definition of "wreck" if you look into my soul
Comes out the most when I feel I'm in a vulnerable place
Made a lot of mistakes I wish I knew how to erase
When I'm afraid, might get distant and I push you away
But no matter the case, I'ma do whatever it takes even if'

[Chorus]
Even if we both break down tonight
And you say you hate me, and we go to bed angry
I know everything will be alright
I'll be here waiting, I promise I'm changing
I just need'

[Post-Chorus]
Time (Oh)
I, I need time (Oh, oh)
I just need time (Oh)
I, I need time (Oh)
Time (Oh), time (Oh)

[Verse 2]
Yeah, way before I bought you the ring
We were fighting back and forth like you were wearin' the thing
Two passionate people not afraid to say what they think
Lead to passionate conversation when it's hard to agree
You know me well, sittin' on the edge of my seat
Lookin' at life, overanalyzin' everything
Always depressed, tryna find a better version of me
Searching for somethin' I know's prolly right in front of my feet
Stubborn as me? Maybe not, but you're close to it
Got a lot of issues, I'm tryin' to work through 'em
Going to therapy for you's somethin' that's worth doin'
When I know you been there for me through all of my worst moments
And I know it hurts knowing that I carry this weight on my chest
Making it difficult for me to open up and connect
Lot of regrets, I apologize for all of the stress
That's not what I meant to do, you know I love you to death even if'

[Chorus]
Even if we both break down tonight
And you say you hate me, and we go to bed angry
I know everything will be alright
I'll be here waiting, I promise I'm changing
I just need...

[Post-Chorus]
Time (Oh)
I, I need time (Oh, oh)
I just need time (Oh)
I, I need time (Oh)
Time (Oh), time (Oh)
I just need time (Oh)
I, I need time (Oh, oh)
I just need time (Oh)
I, I need time (Oh)
Time (Oh), time (Oh)

[Chorus: Fleurie]
Insidious is blind inception
What's reality with all these questions?
Feels like I missed my alarm and slept in
Slept in
Broken legs, but I chase perfection
These walls are my blank expression
My mind is a home I'm trapped in
And it's lonely inside this mansion

[Verse 1: NF]
Yo, my mind is a house with walls, covered in lyrics
They're all over the place, there's songs in the mirrors
Written all over the floors, all over the chairs
And you get the uncut version of life when I go downstairs
That's where I write when I'm in a bad place and need to release
And let out the version of NF you don't wanna see
I put holes in the walls with both of my fists till they bleed
You might get a glimpse of how I cope with all this anger in me
Physically abused, now that's the room that I don't wanna be in
That picture ain't blurry at all, I just don't wanna see it
And these walls ain't blank, I just think I don't wanna see 'em
But why not? I'm in here, so I might as well read 'em
I gotta thank you for this anger that I carry around
Wish I could take a match and burn this whole room to the ground
Matter of fact, I think I'ma burn this room right now
Somehow, this memory, for some reason, just won't burn down
You used to put me in the corner, so you could see the fear in my eyes
Then took me downstairs and beat me till I screamed and I cried
Congratulations, you'll always have a room in my mind
But I'ma keep the door shut and lock the lyrics inside

[Chorus: Fleurie]
Insidious is blind inception
What's reality with all these questions?
Feels like I missed my alarm and slept in
And slept in
Broken legs, but I chase perfection
These walls are my blank expression
My mind is a home I'm trapped in
And it's lonely inside this mansion, inside this mansion

[Verse 2: NF]
Yo, my mind is a house with walls, covered in pain
See, my problem is, I don't fix things, I just try to repaint
Cover 'em up, like it never happened, say, "I wish I could change"
Are you confused? Come upstairs and I'll show you what I mean
This room's full of regrets, it just keeps getting fuller, it seems
The moment I walk into it's the same moment that I wanna leave
I get sick to my stomach every time I look at these things
But it's hard to look past when this is the room where I sleep
I look around, one of the worst things I wrote on these walls
Was the moment I realized that I was losing my mom
One of the first things I wrote was, "I wish I woulda called"
But I should just stop now, we ain't got enough room in this song
And I regret the fact that I struggled trying to find who I am
And I lie to myself and say I do the best that I can
Shrug it off like it ain't nothing, like it's out of my hands
Then get ticked off whenever I see it affecting my plans
And I regret watchin' these trust issues eat me alive
And at the rate I'm goin', they'll probably still be there when I die
Congratulations, you'll always have a room in my mind
The question is, will I ever clean the walls off in time?

[Chorus: Fleurie]
Insidious is blind inception
What's reality with all these questions?
Feels like I missed my alarm and slept in
And slept in
Broken legs, but I chase perfection
These walls are my blank expression
My mind is a home I'm trapped in
And it's lonely inside this mansion, inside this mansion

[Verse 3: NF]
So this part of my house, no one's been in it for years
I built a safe room and I don't let no one in there
'Cause if I do, there's a chance that they might disappear
And not come back, and I admit, I am emotionally scared
To let anyone inside, so I just leave my doors locked
You might get other doors to open up, but this door's not
'Cause I don't want you to have the opportunity to hurt me
And I'll be the only person that I can blame when you desert me
I'm barricaded inside, so stop watchin'
I'm not coming to the door, so stop knockin', stop knockin'
I'm trapped here, God keeps saying I'm not locked in
I chose this, I am lost in my own conscience
I know that shuttin' the world out ain't solvin' the problem
But I didn't build this house because I thought it would solve 'em
I built it because I thought that it was safer in there
But it's not, I'm not the only thing that's livin' in here
Fear came to my house years ago, I let him in
Maybe that's the problem, 'cause I've been dealing with this ever since
I thought that he would leave, but it's obvious, he never did
He must have picked a room and got comfortable and settled in
Now I'm in a position, it's either sit here and let 'em win
Or put him back outside where he came from, but I never can
'Cause in order to do that, I'd have to open the doors
Is that me or the fear talking? I don't know anymore

[Outro: NF & Fleurie]
It's lonely
Inside (Inside), inside (Inside)
It's lonely (It's lonely)
Oh, yeah, it's lonely
Inside this mansion

[Verse: Fear & NF]
What, are you scared of me? That's embarassin'
If it wasn't for me, you would've never wrote Therapy
I've been here for you, but how come you're never there for me?
It's a little bit twisted, but I miss when you and I had scary dreams
I don't really wanna talk about it!
Well, that's too bad now, Nate
Shut up!
Now, where were we?
Well, back in the day when
You and I had it all mapped out in the basement
Cryin' in your room like a baby
"I wish mom was here!"
We all do so we wouldn't have to hear about it every single record
You don't really wanna change me
Yeah, I'm the one that made this happen
Do you really wanna get rid of your main attraction?
Let's pack our bags and go back to Gladwin now
Yeah, it's time for the third record
And you know I got the content
I don't wanna make you nervous
But it ain't like it used to be, we got a lotta people watchin'
You told me that you don't want me in your life, that's pretty hard to digest
And I told you I'd leave when we die, and we ain't died yet
Therapy Session was beautiful, Nate, but I'm wonderin' what's comin' next
Yeah, get that stupid hat off of your head when I'm talkin' to you, you hear what I said?
You don't like the prison I built you?
Yeah, you wanna know what the funny thing is?
You keep on talkin' to me like a stranger, but we've been together since you were a kid (Kid), yeah
Took us from a no-name, told you everything was okay
Now you tryna cut me out of it like I ain't never been a part of it, I am the heart of it, I made this whole thing
Yeah, I put us on the dope stage, you must have no brain
What's the point of having guns if you can't aim?
What's the point of havin' blood with no veins?
What's the point of havin' love with no pain?
What I'm sayin' is me without you doesn't make any sense
I know I'm intense and controlling, but you need to learn how to cope with it, that's just the way that it is
If you didn't want me to live in your house, you shouldn't have let me move in
It's comfortable here and I like it, I got my own room and everything, it don't get better than this
You say you wanna own your life, then wake up and take your own advice
You just mad 'cause you know I'm right
Yeah, I'm flattered you put me in Mansion, but you should've told 'em right
Hold your hands on the coldest nights
You didn't tell 'em 'bout the times you and I used to hold the mic
I mean, what are you, outta your mind?
'Cause both of us will be, come on, let's go outside!
Is this what you wanted?
Both of us out in the open? Let's do it then!
I mean, why are you doin' this?
I know that you're mad, but I'm not in the mood for this
We got a record to drop
So why you actin' like I'm not a part of it?
Aye, where is my shovel at?
Prolly out back'where it always is
You can't get rid of all of me!
I'm the reason why'
Nah, shut up, I don't wanna hear another sentence
Hey, I'm NF
"Is it me or the fear talkin'?" Ha! What a dumb question!
Yeah, it's real music 'til the day we die, right?
Yeah, ain't that the slogan, Nathan?
Thought I told you to keep your mouth shut
I mean, so what? You know I never listen
Let me guess, we gon' dig a hole, kill the track, and prolly put a beat in it
Rap about it for like three minutes
Ayy, that's pretty deep, isn't it?
Wait a minute, you don't really think for a second that you're puttin' me in this?
No, of course not, just a little deeper then we'll go inside and we can stop diggin' (Woo)
You had me scared for a second, I thought we were diggin' my grave [thunk]
We did, what, you don't like bein' afraid?
Here's a dose of your own medicine
What, you don't like how it tastes?
My therapist told me don't bury my issues, but I'ma be honest, man, I'm feelin' great! (Great)
I think it's only right we go back to where you were created
I wrote a song for Johnny without you, but he ain't gon' like it, let's see how he takes it (Takes it)
He probably don't even remember us, does he?
I wish I was buryin' anger
But both of us know I'ma need him for that song, he still lives in the basement
Almost done, shoulda done this a year ago, I don't know why I waited
You know how I get, I put everything off in my personal life, you hear what I'm sayin'?
That was a joke, yeah, it's hilarious, ain't it?
You'll spend the rest of your life in my backyard or back of my mind, depends how you see it
Put the shovel away, time to go back in the house now, you'll be out in a week
Tellin' me you want your room back, that's funny; what, you ain't got nowhere to sleep?
I'ma just look out the window and laugh at you, this is crazy to me
'Cause I thought you had me in prison this whole time, but I'm the one holdin' the keys

[Verse 1]
Yeah, I got off stage like a month ago
I was talking to fans
And one of 'em pulled me aside and said
"We never met, but I swear that you know who I am
I've been through a lot
I don't know how to express it to people, don't think that I can
But I got that Mansion CD on rotation
That's real for me, Nate, you do not understand"
It's crazy for me
Kids hit me up, say they slittin' they wrists on the daily
This music is more than you think
Don't book me for just entertainment, it's entertainin'
Hearin' these parents, they telling their kids
My music is violent'you gotta be kidding me
I guess that your definition of violence and mine
Is something that we look at differently
How do you picture me, huh?
Want me to smile, you want me to laugh?
You want me to walk on the stage with a smile on my face
When I'm mad and put on a mask? For real though
I mean, what you expect from me?
I'm tryna do this respectfully
They say that life is a race
I knew my problems would prolly catch up eventually
I do my best to be calm
How you gon' write me and tell me you'd slaughter my family?
That's just a glimpse to the stuff that gets sent to me
These are the parts of my life they don't never see, woo!
I am aware, it's aggressive
I am not here for acceptance
I don't know what you expected
But what you expect when you walk in a therapy session, huh?

[Chorus]
Therapy, therapy session
Therapy, therapy session

[Verse 2]
This girl at the show looked me in the face
And told me her life's full of drama (Yeah!)
Said her dad is abusive
Apparently, he likes to beat on her mama
I got so angry inside
I wanted to tell her to give me his number
But what you gon' do with it, right?
You gon' hit him up then he'll start hittin' her harder, that's real
These kids, they come to my shows
With tears in they eyes
'Magine someone looking at you
And sayin' your music's the reason that they are alive
Sometimes I don't know how to handle it
This type of life isn't glamorous
This ain't an act for the cameras (Nah!)
You see me walk on these stages
But have no idea what I'm dealing with after it, nah!
I put it all in the open
This is the way that I cope with all my emotion
I'm taking pictures with thousands of people
But honestly, I feel like nobody knows me
I'm tryin' to deal with depression
I'm tryin' to deal with the pressure
How you gon' tell me my music does not have a message
When I'm lookin' out at this crowd full of people I know I affected? Agh!
I got some things in my life (My life)
I know I should let 'em go (Let 'em go)
Let me jot it down (Jot it down)
Let me take a mental note (Mental note)
I put it all in this microphone (Microphone)
Think about that for a minute
What is the point of this song? I'm just ventin'
But what you expect from a therapy session, huh?

[Chorus]
Therapy, therapy session
Therapy, therapy session

[Verse 3]
What you think about me
'That doesn't worry me
I know I handle some things immaturely
I know that I need to grow in maturity
I ain't gon' walk on these stages, in front of these people
And act like I live my life perfectly
That doesn't work for me
"Christian" is not the definition of what "perfect" means, woo!
I ain't the type to be quiet
I ain't gon' sit here in silence
If I wouldn't say what I say to your face
Then I promise you, I wouldn't say it in private
I am not lyin'
People go off on my page, and I'm tryin' to quit the replyin'
But this is ridiculous
I'm passionate, man, I really mean what I'm writing
You want me to keep it a hundred?
Okay, I'll keep it a hundred
I see a whole lot of talkin' on socials
But honestly, I don't see nothing in public
I kinda love it, yeah
"Why don't you write us some happy raps?
That would be awesome"
"All of your music is moody and dark, Nate"
'Don't get me started (Yeah!)
You wanna know what it's like if you met me in person?
Listen to my verses
This music is not just for people
Who sit in the pews and pray at the churches, nah!
I won't reject it
I don't expect everyone to respect it
I don't expect you to get my perspective
But what you expect from a therapy session?
Huh?

[Outro]
I mean, I think sometimes people'they confuse what I'm doin'
I write about life, I write about things that I'm actually dealing with
Something that I'm actually experiencing
This is real for me
Like, this is something that personally helps me as well
I'm not confused about who gave me the gift
God gave me the gift and He gave me the ability to'to do this
And He also gave me this as an outlet
And that's what music is for me
When I feel something, whether it's anger
Um, it's a passion about something'or frustration
Like, this is where I go
This is'this is'that's the whole "NF Real Music" thing, man
This is real for me'I need this
This is a therapy for me

[Intro]
Yeah, real music
Yagh! Yeah
Tell me, what am I doin'?
Just get in that, you get in that head space, y'know?
Tell me, what am I doin'?
Woo!

[Verse]
Will somebody get the body bags? We gon' put the beats in 'em, nah
Put the MCs in 'em, season 'em, put 'em on a beat with me, then I'm eatin' 'em
Get away from the table, you rappers ain't hungry enough, you rappers ain't hungry like us
They talk about me like I'm here, they talk about you like you was, woo!
That nurse came into my room, she told me I'm sick in the head
I'm in hip-hop's hospital bed, with a pad and a pen and a brace on my neck
They told me that I'm never leavin''why? I am as ill as it gets
Any rapper that say that they runnin' the game, I'ma come in they session and cut off they legs, woo!
Strap a grenade to my head, pull out the pin, my music is mind-blowin'
Ain't nobody do it like I do it
You ain't ever been on my level, I got a problem with the way they keep on talkin', and actin' like everybody gonna get it, better sleep with your eyes open
You wanna know what I noticed?
Look around at my fan base and they ready (I see you!)
That last album was heavy (I see you!)
That last album was gritty
How you gon' match that? Just let me'
Do what I do best, you're better off playin' Russian roulette
Than comin' in a booth with me 'cause I get a little bit intense'I'm like, "Who's next?"
Y'all better watch it, take a look at where the clock is
It's my time, this ladder of music that I climbed
I took the machete, the game isn't ready, them rappers, they comin' up on me, I cut off the ladder, and I told 'em, "Bye-bye" (Bye-bye)
What, you lookin' for a high-five? Nice try! (Woo!)
Do not believe everything that you read on the Internet
I do not know who your dentist is, but he should clean out your mouth, don't call me a sellout, that's something I've never been
I've been through Hell all my life though, but I know what Heaven is
Father, forgive me, for I am a sinner, but You gave me music as medicine, woo!
And nobody want a problem when they get in my zone, better leave me be!
I'm a mean MC, better feed me rappers or feed me beats, agh!
Feed me both of 'em, they like, "Nate, what's it like to be famous?"
Hahahahahaha, umm, I'll let you know if I make it! (Yeah)
I wonder what life would be like if I didn't stick out my neck
Two hundred dollars inside of my bank account, woo! I was livin' on that
I need some money to pay for my rent, I need some money to pay for my gas
I'm not complainin', I'm just bein' honest, I promise that I will not beg for respect, nah!
I get so frustrated, take a look at what I've created
Time is wasting, and I ain't waiting
I'm a doctor with no job, me, I don't have no patience, I keep pacing'
Back and forth, I keep racing
You ain't never been in my book and I got a problem with it, why? 'Cause you actin' like you read my pages
I wreck these stages, real talk, better give me space 'cause I am chasing
Something they told me that I won't make it, agh!
I'm not famous, I'm just Nathan (Woo!)
And I wonder how the world gon' take this
They might hate it, but you know anything about me, you know that don't mean I'm changin'
'Cause you know I'm real with it, don't care if you feelin' it, I'm feelin' it
You don't like it? Then deal with it
And if God ain't real'real isn't
Used to wonder why I existed, I exist in the world that's real different
And, "What you gon' be when you grow up, Nate?" I doubt they will get it
My life is a mess, better watch your step when you step in it, some of this brain is off-limits
I'm off in a world you don't get, 'cause you ain't ever been in it
In ten minutes I still couldn't explain what's inside my brain, don't mess with it
I've invested a lot of me inside these lines, I'm just protectin' 'em
Everybody wanna hear the real version of life, then don't get so sensitive
When I say something a little bit raw, I jot my thoughts and they call it "negative"
You wanna know where my heart is? I stand out 'cause I wear my garbage
I work my hardest and every time I look into the mirror I don't forget about where I started, woo!

[Outro]
Tell me, what am I doing here?
Tell me, what am I doing here?
Tell me, what am I, what am I doing? Mmm
Tell me, what am I doing here?
I said, what am I doing here?
Tell me, what am I doing here, if
I'm not being real, mmm

[Verse]
Look, people ask me what the future is
All I know is I'll be doin' this
All I know is things are moving quick
That's convenient for me 'cause that's how I live
Now they see me out here movin' up
You don't like me, that makes two of us
Time change, yeah, I can't adjust
Yo, it's who you are not who you was, oh my
Yeah, just went to Europe, they said the single is working
I think I'm learning
I am way more than what people might think when they look on the surface
What is my purpose? Yeah
That is a question that I have been asking myself and it hurts
'Cause it's prolly something I should already know but I don't know it yet, I'm tryna grow as a person, woo!
I'm sick of people tellin' people I'm here 'cause of marketing dollars, oh
You think that everything is gonna blow just 'cause you market it harder? No
I got my hands in everything, now they out here tryna get to me, stop tryna lecture me
You don't compare to my level of thinking, so why do you think you compare to my energy, huh?
Small circle, but the number's growin'
Fame called me, I'm like, "How you doin'?"
Hung up on him, I ain't ready for it
I'll get back to that when I make album four
Less talkin', I've been workin' more
Better me is what I'm workin' towards
Y'all judgin', but we not in court, no, we not in court, oh Lord!
Last couple years, let's recap
I make a livin' off of writin' out my regrets
I'm doin' me, I don't care where the scene's at
Try to give me feedback, I don't really need that
I used to walk on stage in a V-neck
I used to wear a lil' tie with a black vest
I came a long way, why you lookin' upset?
I'm tryna paint a picture, get the vision, you ain't hear it yet, woo!
Look, hold up, hold up, wait a minute, please
Flow's switchin', I got ADD
Brain scatters when you play the beat
It don't matter what you say to me
I'll be doin' this at 83
I've been doin' this since ABCs
In the major leagues doin' major things, don't play with me, woo!
I'm livin' life in the fast lane
Wake up every morning thinkin' I'ma have a bad day
Drive my own car, I don't like the valet
Park then I go into my mind with an AK
Shoot every thought in my head then it rotates
Losin' it all, but I think that I'm okay
Who is involved? I don't know, but I'm insane
Poof! And I'm gone, wanna call me a no name, what!?
I'm prolly not what you thought
I'm prolly not what you thought
I used to judge everybody that wasn't like me 'til I learned it was wrong
Girl told me I should get it together and get out the dark
I'm tryna give her my heart
That's when I sit in my car, writin' for hours until I can barely talk
I mean, where do I start?
Feels like I'm fallin' apart
Act like my image is hard
I always put up my guard
Even when talkin' to God
Sit in my room and I plot
Everything that I'm not
Comes out in the music I jot
I give it all that I got
I give it all that I got!
I'm tryna think out the box, no!
Yeah, I got people standing outside a bus screaming my name
I don't come out and take pictures, they tell me I changed
I don't smile in VIPs, you get mad like, "You know what I paid?"
Guess I don't know what to say
Guess I don't know what to say
I leave it all on the stage
I leave it all on the stage

[Verse]
I'm lookin' like I'm gonna get it, you prolly don't get it
I come in your house with a microphone
Lookin' like I'm 'bout to set up a show in your kitchen
I'm out of my mind, but I feel like I'm in it
If I never make it, don't make any difference
I'm still gonna kill it, you know what the deal is
Ain't never no chillin' when I'm in the buildin'
NF is a monster, I am a villain
My music is sick, and you don't know what ill is
You better get back, I don't write any filler
I write what I feel and I'm feelin' a million
So you better shh, be quiet, you hear it?
I'm 'bout to lose it
I'm on a whole different level of music
Don't treat me like I have no clue how to do this
You better rethink what you're thinkin' and move it
Now picture me writin' when I was a kid
Tryna make it in music, I think it is crazy
I spent all my money on studio time
Tryna get on my music so people could play it
I'ma keep it one hundred, my music was terrible
Learned to get better the more that I made it
Go back to my Moments album, most of you people
You prolly don't know what I'm sayin', hold up
What you're witnessin' now? Don't try to figure me out
I grab on that microphone, jawin' the crowd
They was laughin' at me, who they laughin' at now, huh?
I laugh at myself, some people they lookin' like, "Wow
The moment you told me that you was a rapper
I couldn't believe it," you believe it now?
Step in the booth and I murder it
You never heard of a rapper that kill it like I do
I sleep on the couch in the studio
Stay up till three in the morning, and write till I get more
The moment I wake up I feel like I don't even sleep
And I'm ready to put out my record
Which, thank you for buyin', maybe you burned it
But either way, I'm gonna wreck it
I look at the industry, look what it did to me
You'll never make it if you never grind
You put a whole lot of money into it
You better be ready to give it your time
I look at the past awful years of my life
And I promise you I have been givin' it mine
Try to keep up with this, I'm not a puppet
No string on my back, I'm one of a kind
Music is changing, no way to tame this
I am an artist, look what I painted
Hang up the caution tape, I'm dangerous
Does anyone know where my brain is?
Rappers are comfortable knowin' they're famous
But I, really don't care what your name is
And I, really don't care if I'm nameless
Y'all just drivin' around, I know where my lane is
Cocky? Nah, I'm competitive
This is a job for me, it's adrenaline
Don't try to box me in, I am Mayweather
I come in the ring, my punches are way better
I never drink, but I live in these bars
The moment you blink is the moment you lost
Say you a king, who put you in charge?
Don't care what you think, I'll break in your car
Climb on the top of it, sound the alarm
And wake up the neighborhood, rap in your yard
And carry the speakers on both of my arms
Till you keep sleepin' on me, I'm at large
Enough with the jokes, I ain't jokin'
You come in a session with me, I'ma show you what dope is
And when I say dope, I ain't talkin' 'bout smokin'
I'm talkin' 'bout music that has an emotion
I look at this mic, it's part of my family
Take it away, I'm comin' to find you
I've been through a lot in my life
And it's hard to get people to listen when no one's behind you
And then Capitol came in the picture and gave me a shot
And look at it now
I look at the team I'm dealin' with, agh
These people ain't playin' around
Lookin' back, I gotta laugh
I was in a whole different place a year ago
I look at the math, I look at the map
And thank you God, I swear it's a miracle
And I'm sorry, but I gotta leave
But, man, this track was beautiful
The least I can do if I murder a beat
Is take the time to go to its funeral, haha

[Chorus]
Even if we both break down tonight
And you say you hate me, and we go to bed angry
I know everything will be alright
I'll be here waiting, I promise I'm changing
I just need...

[Verse 1]
A little time to show you I'm worth it
I know that I can be a difficult person
I'm a stress case, drive you up the wall when I'm workin'
Actually, I'm probably worse when I'm not, you don't deserve it
Make you nervous 'cause you know I'ma break soon
Every time I do, I say somethin' that hurts you
Actin' like I'm gone, but we both in the same room
I don't like to be wrong, which I know you relate to
And I know I make you feel like you're at the end of your rope
That's when I look at you and tell you I'd be better alone
Just the pride talkin', isn't it? 'Cause both of us know
I'm the definition of "wreck" if you look into my soul
Comes out the most when I feel I'm in a vulnerable place
Made a lot of mistakes I wish I knew how to erase
When I'm afraid, might get distant and I push you away
But no matter the case, I'ma do whatever it takes even if'

[Chorus]
Even if we both break down tonight
And you say you hate me, and we go to bed angry
I know everything will be alright
I'll be here waiting, I promise I'm changing
I just need'

[Post-Chorus]
Time (Oh)
I, I need time (Oh, oh)
I just need time (Oh)
I, I need time (Oh)
Time (Oh), time (Oh)

[Verse 2]
Yeah, way before I bought you the ring
We were fighting back and forth like you were wearin' the thing
Two passionate people not afraid to say what they think
Lead to passionate conversation when it's hard to agree
You know me well, sittin' on the edge of my seat
Lookin' at life, overanalyzin' everything
Always depressed, tryna find a better version of me
Searching for somethin' I know's prolly right in front of my feet
Stubborn as me? Maybe not, but you're close to it
Got a lot of issues, I'm tryin' to work through 'em
Going to therapy for you's somethin' that's worth doin'
When I know you been there for me through all of my worst moments
And I know it hurts knowing that I carry this weight on my chest
Making it difficult for me to open up and connect
Lot of regrets, I apologize for all of the stress
That's not what I meant to do, you know I love you to death even if'

[Chorus]
Even if we both break down tonight
And you say you hate me, and we go to bed angry
I know everything will be alright
I'll be here waiting, I promise I'm changing
I just need...

[Post-Chorus]
Time (Oh)
I, I need time (Oh, oh)
I just need time (Oh)
I, I need time (Oh)
Time (Oh), time (Oh)
I just need time (Oh)
I, I need time (Oh, oh)
I just need time (Oh)
I, I need time (Oh)
Time (Oh), time (Oh)

[Verse 1]
Woke up in the cell, where am I at?
Yeah, it's cold, but I like that
What am I, trapped?
Heart's beating out of my chest
Door's locked, but the keys are in my hands
Hmm, yeah, that's weird, it doesn't make sense, does it?
I make songs, I don't make friends'judge me
Might smile, but it ain't that funny
Sing along to the pain, they love it
Life's like a merry-go-round
And I'm still tryna figure it out
I like space, I don't fit in the crowds
My whole life I've been airin' it out
Oh, I'm gettin' into character now
Feels wrong, but it feels right
My feelings seal tight real nice
But I will fight anything to win
But I'm not Mike Tyson, I won't bite ya
But I will tell you if I don't like you
I am not the norm
I got my own shoes, I ain't tryna fit in yours
I never been married, but I've felt divorced
Hi, I'm Nate, have we met before?
Somebody told you I was wack? Check the source
Somebody told you I was back? Yes, of course
You got a problem with the fans? There's the door
You lookin' for the old me? Check the morgue, agh!
Not a fortune-teller, but I can see into the future better
Ain't no tellin' what'll happen when I pick up the microphone, get the fans together
Same style, but the songs are better
Been a year and a half, feels like it's gone forever
Ain't no drink in my hand, but you know the buzz is comin'
Big steps in the game, yeah, the Hulk is running
My thoughts are funny, it feels like I'm onto something, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm high off the music, my head's in the clouds
I kinda like it up here; I am not comin' down
I'd rather be alone, I am not good in crowds
Which is kinda confusin', I know'been that way since a child
They laugh and they tell me I'll never get out
I'm just tryna be me, I am nobody else
I don't care what you think, I'm just bein' myself
So I guess for now

[Chorus]
I'll just be the outcast
I'll just be the outcast
I'll just be the outcast
I guess I'll be the outcast

[Verse 2]
Yeah, I guess I don't fit the mold of rap
'Cause I'm respectin' women
I heard your record, I was laughin at it (Ha, ha, ha)
Maybe they would like me more if I got a little graphic with it
Nah, I don't wanna blend in with you little rappin' idiots'I'd rather be the outcast
I ain't never puttin' out trash
I take a hundred and staple it right to my tongue
I always put the money where my mouth's at, agh!
Feels good to be here now
I'm a weird person with a weird crowd
What, you don't like that?
That's cool, that's great, that's fine, okay, you can leave now
Got a weird smile, but I like it though
I paint it on me and I'm walkin' to the microphone
And put the caution tape around me like I did in Intro 1, yeah!
Yeah, they got me reminiscin' now!
Yeah, you done know I'm 'bout to go mad
Never wanted something so bad
Goosebumps through the whole track
Ain't no way I'm gonna hold back
Got me thinkin' that I'm cookin' in a meth lab
I don't blow it up in front of my own eyes
You look a little lost, you ain't get that?
Comin' from a town where nobody is a rapper
Guess I never get the memo, must've missed that
Wow!
Here I go in my feelings again, I can feel it again
So I lay in my bed, in my cell with the pen
And I dwell on my sins, I keep wonderin' when
Time to open the the doors, they don't know who I am
But I pick up the keys and I put on my Timbs
And I stare at the locks and the tat on my skin
And I think to myself, "I don't wanna fit in"

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm high off the music, my head's in the clouds
I kinda like it up here; I am not comin' down
I'd rather be alone, I am not good in crowds
Which is kinda confusin', I know'been that way since a child
They laugh and they tell me I'll never get out
I'm just tryna be me, I am nobody else
I don't care what you think, I'm just bein' myself
So I guess for now

[Chorus]
Yeah, I'll just be the outcast
I'll just be the outcast
I'll just be the outcast
I guess I'll be the outcast

[Verse 3]
Yeah, tryna focus
Take a knife to my head then I cut it open
Take my brain, put it on the floor'tryna figure out my motives
Y'all thought I was an issue when the door was locked
Nah, you should see me when the door opens
Every night I can hear voices
Put a camera in my face, might turn Joker like I'm Mike Posner
Always been a little complex
Difficult to process
Some of y'all wanna sit around and try to pick apart my bars
Here's some lines you could dissect:
If I'ma die, I'ma die givin' everything that I have
Take a deep breath, I don't need y'all's respect
I'm a reject kid at recess playin' games with his make-believe friends
Yeah, I don't ever take a night off
Lights off in the room and I write songs
I might fall into my thoughts once in a while when the mic's off
You ain't ever seen no drive like mine, better hop outta my car
I'm about to unlock my doors
You ain't got a seat belt on, better find one
Gettin' sick of people tellin' me to smile more
T.S. was a chapter I'll never forget, it was therapy for me
But it's time to turn the page now
Hey, shut up! I'm tryna tell 'em my story!
I'm sorry, I wasn't yellin' at y'all, I was talkin' to the voices
I rip out the drums of the industry's ears for tryin' to ignore me and playin' while singin' this chorus

[Chorus]
I'll just be the outcast
I'll just be the outcast
I'll just be the outcast
I guess I'll be the outcast

[Chorus]
I'll just be the outcast
I'll just be the outcast
I'll just be the outcast
I guess I'll be the outcast

[Verse 1]
Yeah, most of my life's full of sad days
Started at a young age
Yeah, bought a house but I've been livin' on stage
Tryna find the real me, I ain't found it yet
Wake up every morning feelin' like I'm guilty
Talk to God, "Can You hear me?"
Lately, I'm a mess
I don't want no one to help me
Yeah, I don't want no one to help me and

[Pre-Chorus 1]
If you think that I make decisions based off of what you think, then you're wrong
Can't nobody think for me, I got my own thoughts
Sometimes you don't know what you had until it's all gone, till it's all gone
If I took the hand that was dealt me then I would be nowhere in life
Yeah, I had to think smart
Threw away the deck and got my own cards
Long before I had the money to afford a car

[Chorus 1]
I'I've been doin' me (yeah)
I've been doin' me
Yeah, I've been doin' me
I've been doin' me
Followin' my dreams
Yeah, I've been doin' me
I've been doin' me
I've been doin' me
Yeah, I've been doin' me
I've been doin' me
Followin' my dreams
Yeah, I've been doin' me

[Verse 2]
Most of my life's full of regrets
Things I wanna take back, yeah
Wrote you a letter, wish that I had never sent that
Didn't even make sense, I don't even know
All I know is I get lower on the weekends
They tell me I should make friends, I just sit at home
Lately, I've been off the deep end, yeah
I've been off the deep end and

[Pre-Chorus 2]
If you think that I'm 'bout to change who I am just for you then you're so wrong
As a kid I built a house around my broke heart
Sometimes you don't know what you had until it falls apart, till it falls apart
If I took the hand that was dealt me then I would be nowhere in life
Yeah, I had to think smart
Threw away the deck and got my own cards
Long before I had the money to afford a car

[Chorus 2]
I (yeah)'I've been doin' me (oh, yeah)
I've been doin' me
Yeah, I've been doin' me (I have been)
I've been doin' me
Followin' my dreams
Yeah, I've been doin' me (followin' my)
I've been doin' me
I've been doin' me (I've been followin' my)
Yeah, I've been doin' me
Followin' my dreams
Yeah, I'm just doin' me
Yeah, I'm just doin' me

[Verse 3]
Yeah, I'm reminiscin' back to both of us laughin'
Playin' old records, thinkin' every one of 'em's classic
Windows down, we on the street up in Michigan rappin'
We talked about it, but never really knew it could happen
My confidence about as low as the gas is
We didn't have the money for it, so we'd turn the key backwards and sit in parking lots for hours till the battery crashes
I think that we related 'cause both of us were lookin' for answers
A couple months ago I drove into Gladwin, got me all in my feelings
It's somethin' 'bout bein' somewhere that's familiar
Pull in the gas station, open up the tank then I fill it then laugh
Would I move back? Mm, not in a million, but I appreciate the memories we had
I know you've been callin', sorry I never call back
I know I've been distant, you know I never meant that
You can tell the family how I'm doing if they ask
I'm just doin' me

[Verse 1]
Yeah, look
I don't do drugs, I'm addicted to the pain though
Yeah, I been on it for a while, dunno how to put it down
Gotta have it, it's a habit I'ma break though
I just wanna take a hit, keep sayin' I'ma quit
Keep sayin' I'ma leave, but I stay though
I just want a little fix, I don't wanna take a risk
I don't like it when I drift from the safe zone
But lately, I been thinkin' I'ma have to
Lettin' go of things that I'm attached to
World don't stop just because I'm in a bad mood
You don't know what love is 'til you holdin' onto somethin' that you can't lose
I swear I'm tryna get it together
Sleeves up, puttin' work in, tryna be better
I like to rap, but I ain't gon' do it forever
Forget the charts, I've been focusing' on holdin' my head up
Moment I get up, I just wanna know I'm doin' my best
And if I'm not, Lord forgive me, you can have the regrets
'Cause I can feel the water tryna go up over my head
Most of my life, I always felt like I was holdin' my breath
Holdin' my chest, to be honest, so I'm tired of it
Lookin' for somethin' in my life to be inspired again
I like to walk around and act like I don't know what it is
But I know what it is, I just never wanna commit

[Chorus]
Runnin' from change
I'm lookin' for change
I'm searchin' for change
I'm lookin' for change
I just want, I just want change

[Verse 2]
Yeah, I don't like new things
Got a lot of mood swings
Oh, you wanna tell me somethin' negative?
I don't wanna hear what you think
Yeah, tossin' in my sleep
Every night for like two weeks
Thinkin' 'bout how I could have done this or done that better
Can't help it, that's just me
Lies, that's me avoidin' the change
Yeah, that's probably why the issues ain't goin' away
Yeah, that's probably why I always sit around and complain
Tellin' myself that I ain't never gettin' out of this place
Out of my face if you tellin' me I need to be different
That's the issue though, I'm always insecurity-driven
Takin' the wrong turns, actin' like I know where I'm headed
Waitin' for somethin' bad to happen, I can snap any minute
I need change
Yeah, that's kinda easy to say, right?
But difficult to do when I feel like I hate life
And everyone around me kinda thinks I'm a great guy
But I don't ever think it so I think I'm a fake liar
Change
It's somethin' that I know I should do
I'm a little uncomfortable, to tell you the truth
But to be honest with you lately, I got nothin' to lose
See, I've always been full of pain, but now I'm makin' some room

[Chorus]
Lookin' for change
I'm lookin' for change
I'm searchin' for change
I'm lookin' for change
I just want, I just want'

[Verse 3]
I need a moment of silence
I don't like change, but I'll try it
I don't wanna hear what I should or I shouldn't do
Why are they always defiant?
See, all my emotions are liars
All my emotions are violent
They don't want freedom to find me
Mention a name and everybody riots (Change)
Yeah, that's why I'm checkin' my vitals
They keep on workin', but I know
Breathin' don't mean you're alive, so
I bag up all of my trash and walk out on my tightrope
Positive thoughts are my rivals (Change)
I'm tryna be on their side though
Should I feel comfortable? I don't
Last year, I felt suicidal
This year, I might do somethin' different like talkin' to God more

[Chorus]
I'm lookin' for change
I'm lookin' for (Yeah)
I'm searchin' for change
I'm lookin' for
I just want, I just want change
I'm lookin' for (Yeah)
I'm searchin' for change
I'm lookin' for, yeah (Ayy, ayy)
I just want, I just want change
Yeah, I'm lookin' for (Lookin' for)
I'm searchin' for change
I'm lookin' for (Yeah)
I just want, I just want change
I'm lookin' for (Ayy)
I'm searchin' for change (Ayy)
I'm lookin' for, yeah
I just want, I just want change

[Chorus]
I don't see you like I should
You look so misunderstood
And I wish I could help
But it's hard when I hate myself
Pray to God with my arms open
If this is it, then I feel hopeless
And I wish I could help
But it's hard when I hate myself

[Verse 1]
Yeah, late nights are the worst for me
They bring out the worst in me
Mind runnin', got me feelin' like it hurts to think
If this is all that I wanted, I don't want it, gotta be more for me
All the core beliefs
And every mornin' I wake up and feel like I am not worth it 'cause I'm at war with peace
I go to Hell, walk up to the corpse of me
Look at the body like, "You ain't nothin' but poor and weak"
It's kinda weird
Lately I been feelin' like the only way for me to get away is if I pour the drink
That's more deceit, more defeat
Is this really what I'm born to be?
That's what you get for thinkin' you're unique
So poor, but I'm so wealthy
Need help, but you can't help me
What else can the world sell me?
Tell me lies, I still buy 'em like they're goin' outta stock
But it's not healthy

[Chorus]
I don't see you like I should
You look so misunderstood
And I wish I could help
But it's hard when I hate myself
Pray to God with my arms open
If this is it, then I feel hopeless
And I wish I could help
But it's hard when I hate myself

[Verse 2]
Yeah, late nights get the best of me
They know how to get to me
Suicide thoughts come and go like a guest to me
But I don't wanna die, I just wanna get relief
So don't talk to me like you think I'm so successful
What is success when hope has left you?
I am not a spokesman, I'm a broken record
Sick of doin' interviews 'cause I hate myself, agh!
Come across like it's so easy
But I feel like you don't need me
When I feel like you don't need me
Then I feel like you don't see me
And my life has no meaning, drain me
Hands out, tryna ask for love
But when I get it, I just pass it up
Throw it away and think about it later
Diggin' through the trash for drugs
Wish I could give you what you needed, but I can't
I'm scared because

[Chorus]
I don't see you like I should
You look so misunderstood
And I wish I could help
But it's hard when I hate myself
Pray to God with my arms open
If this is it, then I feel hopeless
And I wish I could help
But it's hard when I hate myself

[Verse 3]
I walk through the ashes of my passions
Reminiscin' with the baggage in my casket
Get lost in the questions I can't answer
Can't stand who I am, but it don't matter
We scream to be free, but I stay captured
Knee-deep in defeat of my own actions
Feel weak, but the peace that I keep lacking
Keeps speakin' to me, but I can't have it
But I can't have it
Keeps speakin' to me, but I can't have it
But I can't have it
Keeps speakin' to me, but I can't have it

[Chorus]
I don't see you like I should
You look so misunderstood
And I wish I could help
But it's hard when I hate myself
Pray to God with my arms open
If this is it, then I feel hopeless
And I wish I could help
But it's hard when I hate myself
Hate myself
But it's hard when I hate myself
Hate myself
But it's hard when I hate myself

[Outro]
When I hate myself
It's kinda hard when I hate myself
I hate myself
It's hard when I hate myself

[Verse 1]
When did I become so numb?
When did I lose myself?
All the words that leave my tongue
Feel like they came from someone else

[Chorus]
I'm paralyzed, where are my feelings?
I no longer feel things, I know I should
I'm paralyzed, where is the real me?
I'm lost and it kills me inside, I'm paralyzed

[Verse 2]
When did I become so cold?
When did I become ashamed? (ohh)
Where's the person that I know?
They must have left, they must have left, with all my faith

[Chorus]
I'm paralyzed, where are my feelings?
I no longer feel things, I know I should
I'm paralyzed, where is the real me?
I'm lost and it kills me inside, I'm paralyzed

[Bridge]
I'm paralyzed
I'm scared to live, but I'm scared to die
And if life is pain then I buried mine
A long time ago, but it's still alive
And it's takin' over me, where am I?
I wanna feel somethin', I'm numb inside
But I don't feel nothin', I wonder why
I'm in the race of life and time passed by
Look, I sit back and I watch it
Hands in my pockets
Waves come crashin' over me, but I just watch 'em
I just watch 'em
I'm underwater but I feel like I'm on top of it
I'm at the bottom and I don't know what the problem is
I'm in a box, but I'm the one that locked me in
Suffocatin' and I'm runnin' out of oxygen, ah!

[Chorus]
I'm paralyzed, where are my feelings?
I no longer feel things, I know I should
I'm paralyzed, where is the real me?
I'm lost and it kills me inside, I'm paralyzed

[Outro]
(I'm just so paralyzed) I'm paralyzed
(Yeah, I'm just so paralyzed) Where are my feelings?
I no longer feel things (I have no feelings)
I know I should (Oh, how come I'm not moving? Why aren't I moving?)
I'm paralyzed (Ay, yeah)
Where is the real me? (Where is the real me? Where is the real me?)
I'm lost and it kills me, (I'm paralyzed) inside (I'm paralyzed)
I'm paralyzed (I'm paralyzed)

[Verse 1]
Yeah, sometimes I wanna disappear like I just don't exist
Or find a time machine and take me back when I was six
Maybe younger, either way, I guess the point of it
Would be to tell that little kid that he's gon' take a lotta hits
Yeah, I'd probably grab your hand and tell you life is hard
If you got questions or you need advice, then talk to God
'Cause He's the only one that listens even when you think He isn't
Even good people are great at makin' bad decisions, yeah (Oh)
They ain't gon' take it serious
You find out pretty quick that life is more than just appearances
I know some things we could avoid to save embarrassment
But everything that breaks you down can also build your character
'Cause people love to see you fail, just be aware of it
Don't let nobody tell you who to be or write your narrative
Look, we're all products of the things that we experience
But there's a big difference between confidence and arrogance
You hearin' this?
I know that you don't get it now, but you gon' get it later
I know you feel like you're alone and no one loves you maybe
And you gon' cover insecurities with lotsa anger
The weird thing is someday all of this will make you famous (Oh)
You start to write about your life and while they're all relatin'
You'll make up a slogan, call it "Real," but feel like you're the fakest
Wish I could tell you that your future's nothin' but amazin'
That's just not the case, and I guess I just don't know how to say this

[Chorus]
I don't know if you can hear me or not
But if you can, I just want you to know
You gon' make a lotta mistakes
And they gon' laugh in our face
That's part of life, that's just the way that it goes
(That's just the way that it goes)
And I don't know if you can hear me or not
But if you can, I just need you to get it
I know you been questionin' life
Trust me, I know what it's like
I'm here for you if you need someone to listen
Do you need someone to listen?

[Verse 2]
See, Mom and Dad are not together, they took different routes
But you probably already knew, you gettin' older now
Remember back when Mom picked us up from Grandma's house?
And she hid her boyfriend in the trunk and drove a couple miles?
Down the street, and then she pulled over to let him out
'Cause she ain't want Dad to know she had these type of dudes around
'Cause last time he found out, he had to take us from her
You look uncomfortable, I'm sorry, let me change the subject (Hey)
You know how we've always struggled with abandonment? (Yeah)
And when we feel like someone's leaving, we start panickin'? (Yeah)
And yo, I wish I could say I've learned to manage it
You think it's bad now, but you don't know the half of it
Passion is somethin' we have never lacked
We see it the most when we're writin' raps
They think it's funny now, let 'em laugh
I know you think it's just an outlet when you're really mad
But you don't know the platform you're about to have (Oh)
I know some things about the future you ain't ready for
I know some things that you gon' cover up, but can't ignore
And what hurts is they gon' surface at the worst moments
And we gon' act like it don't hurt us, but it hurts, don't it?
We walk around with the devil talkin' on both shoulders
Wish I could tell you that he disappears when we get older
But that's just not the case, and I know you feel out of place
And everything is not okay, and life can be a lot to take, but'

[Chorus]
I don't know if you can hear me or not
But if you can, I just want you to know
You gon' make a lotta mistakes
And they gon' laugh in our face
That's part of life, that's just the way that it goes
(That's just the way that it goes)
And I don't know if you can hear me or not
But if you can, I just need you to get it
I know you been questionin' life
Trust me, I know what it's like
I'm here for you if you need someone to listen
Do you need someone to listen?

[Verse 3]
You know how intoxicated people make us nervous?
To the point sometimes we shake and it feels so disturbin'
Don't be scared, that's just trauma tryna reach the surface
And tell us everyone we love is gonna try to hurt us
Which isn't true, but it's a lie that both of us believe in
Yeah, you might get a glimpse of happiness from your achievements
But what you'll learn as you get older, every time you reach one
Is you'll just make another goal that doesn't lead to freedom
See, some things about to happen that you can't imagine
At 24, you'll drop an album, and you'll call it Mansion
At 25, you'll put out Therapy and gain some traction
Skip to track number four, now that's a really sad one
Yeah, Perception's coming next, we 'bout to reach the masses
It sounds awesome; at the same time, it doesn't matter
At 27, we'll make millions, but it's really sad 'cause
You learn to realize that none of this will make you happy

[Outro]
I wish that I could look at you with empathy
Sometimes I feel like I've become what you were scared to be
Which makes it really hard to look at you with sympathy
'Cause if I'm feeling bad for you, then I have to feel bad for me
And that's just something I feel like we don't deserve
That's why I'm always looking down on you, I know it hurts
I'm sure you have a lot of questions
I've been tryna search to find us both some answers
I'll be here for you if things get worse
Too many faces, too many faces, too many faces

[Intro]
Yeah, you, baby, you
You're something special
Baby, I know
I know what you're thinkin'
Maybe, maybe, I'm wasting your time
But I promise, but I promise
I know that I go back and forth
But I won't let you, I won't let you, I won't let you down
Yeah

[Verse 1]
I meant it when I told you I would change
Meant it when I told you I would stay
Sick of talkin' on the phone, babe
Time to pack your car and come to my state
Come to my place, look at my face, oh, yeah
You know I ain't playin'
I sent you some money, yeah, hop in the car
And get on the road, here we go
Baby, I can't lie
I'm a little bit, I'm a little bit scared right now, girl, girl, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
You said you want more
And I can't blame you for
Askin' me for somethin' you deserve

[Chorus]
You're special
Yo-yo-you're special
Oh yeah, you're special
Yo-yo-you're special

[Verse 2]
Yeah, I knew it, you was my type
We ain't gotta skip to the highlight
You're the highlight, girl, of my life (woo)
Both of us have got a past, but it's alright
All night car rides
Drivin' through the city, yeah, the view's fantastic
It's automatic, could see you smile, gotta have it
She got me thinkin' maybe I'ma have to put a ring on it, girl
I ain't never been a romantic, but I can romance ya
Get your shoes on, baby, I am not asking
I'm 'bout to take you out to dinner, put the black dress on
Got the room gaspin', how did this happen?
I don't even know
She's the type to sing my words at the show
She's the type to pick me up when I'm low
And remind me she got my back, no matter what
Yeah, I think she hearin' me now
Say what I think, so I'm thinkin' out loud
I need a woman I know I can trust, and I got one
I guess you can say that she down
Callin' my phone, and she told me she proud
She said my name and I like how that sounds, oh, yeah
(I like that)

[Bridge]
I like how this sounds
(Baby, I'yeah)
Baby, don't make me lose myself
Baby, I need somebody I know I can trust (Yeah)
I mean, I'm being honest
I ain't ever met a girl like you (No)
Baby, you can call me
You can call me anytime
You can call me any day, anytime
You know I'ma answer
I won't let you, I won't let you down, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
You said you want more
And I can't blame you for
Askin' me for somethin' you deserve (You deserve it)

[Chorus]
You're special, yeah
Yo-yo-you're special
I said, girl, I said, you're special
I said, you're special

[Intro: Andreas Moss]
This may be the last sunset I'll see
So I'll take it in, I'll take it in
This may be the last air that I'll breathe
So I'll breathe it in, I'll breathe it in

[Verse 1: NF]
I heard that pictures don't change
Just the people inside of 'em do
Whoever told you that life would be easy
I promise that person was lyin' to you
You got a problem with followin' through
That's why I got a problem with followin' you
You keep lookin' at me like this problem is new
But we've been here before, what you tryin' to do?
Don't talk to me like I don't know what you're feeling
'Cause I was there with you back in the beginning
Quit looking away when I talk, let me finish
I'm tryna be honest, you're tryna forget me, ugh
What's wrong with you, hey?
I know that you got a lot on your plate
You keep telling me I should get out of your way
But I can't see how you gon' lie to my face
Don't tell me you're fine
'Cause I know you're not, so don't even try it
And what? We gon' live in this life full of pain
'Til we're eighty and one day we'll get up and say we regretted our lives?
'Cause that's where we're going
And do not pretend like you don't even notice
The funny thing is that you already know it
I'm starting to think that you like how it feels to be lost in the moment

[Chorus: Andreas Moss]
Lost, lost in the moment
Lost in the moment, lost in the moment
And get lost, lost in the moment
Lost in the moment, lost in the moment

[Verse 2: NF]
Yeah, they told us that time flies, didn't know what it means
Now I feel like we're just running around tryna
Catch it and hoping to cut off its wings
But that ain't gon' happen
Joy, when was the last time we had it?
I don't remember 'cause all that we do
Is go backwards, but that's what you get
When you live in the past
And I know we're breathing but we're not alive
Really, is this the way we wanna die?
'Til you got everything bottled inside
If they only knew what goes on in our minds
I know what you're thinking so don't try to hide
Why do you look at me like you surprised?
If you really mean what you write in these lines
Then why don't you fix it, 'cause I'm getting tired!
Yeah, I can no longer do this
Ever since you fell in love with the music
See? You find a way to express what you feel
But the moment that you get away from the mic, you don't know what you're doing
Is it clear to you yet?
I don't know what's going on in your head
But eventually, you'll have to deal with the things
That you talk about yeah, but I guess until then, we're lost!

[Chorus: Andreas Moss]
Lost, lost in the moment
Lost in the moment, lost in the moment
And get lost, lost in the moment
Lost in the moment, lost in the moment

[Outro: Andreas Moss]
Yeah, oh, yeah, oh lost
Oh, yeah, oh, no no
This may be the last sunset I'll see
So I'll take it in, I'll take it in
This may be the last air that I'll breathe
So I'll breathe it in, I'll breathe it in

[Verse]
What is perfect? Not me
I've been overworkin' for weeks
I go home then purchase some things
That I know will not fill my needs
Have a dose of what I've achieved
Then get lonesome and I critique
Who I am and what I believe
Make up standards too high to reach
Untrained animal off the leash
I'm in panic, but yet relieved
Brought your hammock to hang with me?
Grab a hatchet, cut down your tree
Like a mannequin that can speak
What I have in store is unique
I just mop the floors with MCs
I can't stop until things are clean
I'm an amateur's what you think
So you stand there in disbelief
'Til I dislocate both your feet
That's what happens, you step to me
Not too graphic, but not PG
Lots of action in every scene
I'm kidnapping all of your dreams
Hold 'em hostage and watch 'em scream (Ahh!)
Rap aside, I am what I advertise
Don't matter how you put it, we live, then we have to die
You might hate it, but you can't deny
See, everything that I've been doing got me lookin' like a mastermind
It's so vain, but I vandalize that I do what you fantasizin'
Took a vision of my dreams
And then found a better way that I can make it
I've been looking, think I'm really 'bout to maximize it (Agh!)
These bullets form in my mind and come out my mouth and (Pow, pow, pow)
For anyone out there doubting or acting mouthy (Watch, watch, watch)
Forget what you heard about me, I've been astounding (Got, got, got)
Something for you thinking you might run circles 'round me
Yeah, ain't this all I ever wanted?
That's a fact, no, that's a lie, no
I'm confused, yeah, I got problems
What's the use? Yeah, let's be honest
Screws are loose, I need 'em tightened
Not amused, yeah, look what I did
Brought you something, hope you like it
So precise, the flow the nicest
So productive, stop your whining
Back in style like I was vinyl
I make songs and they go viral
Something's off if I go idle
"Been so long," yeah, okay, I know
Take your shoes off, you're in my home
You got fans, but not like I do, yeah (I do, I do)
Thankful, I try to be, can't contain what's inside of me
They don't like this side of me 'cause I lack in compliancy
I question what I can see if you're not playing my CD
No expiring, I'll decide when I think it's my time to leave (Woo)
Yeah, 'cause they won't retire me, it inspires me to be inspiring
When I'm low I feel like I'm spiraling
Pushin' forward, look, I can't ignore it
There ain't no I in team, but drop the T and A
Sometimes, if I'm bein' honest, feels like it's only me
No defeat, notably, better have it right if you're quoting me
Write my name on your hit list, it might be the last time you wrote something
Rip that cocky smile right off your face for thinking you're close to me
Grab a can of gasoline, light it all over your self-esteem
Selfishly watching y'all helplessly pretend you're on my planet
Shoot you out of the sky like you're punchlines, you are not landin'
Gun jammin', reach in your mouth and rip out your tongue after tongue
Lashings, I hand 'em out like pamphlets in church, Pastor
Show up to my funeral wearin' all black, and what's happenin'?
I look around and wonder, "Where my fans at?"
Oh Lord, they know me so well, they know I'm not in that casket
Trash bag is prolly buried somewhere full of my ashes
My music's superb, playin' with words, play with my nerves
They gon' have a list of issues long as my shirts
Very absurd, very disturbed
Stare at the Earth like, "This is not the place I was birthed"
I'm generic, you sure?
Oh, they think I'm very reserved
'Til I open up on the beat like on my Therapy work
I don't care what you heard, real scary, carry the verse
While I'm wearin' my merch, stompin' on your arrogant turf
Sit back and observe, nah, I like to actually work
This life's so unpredictable, it just keeps pitching me curves
I take a swing, I hate the things that make me feel like I'm dirt
I've patiently been waitin', please, I think it's time for my turn
My expertise are melodies, they talk to me when I'm hurt
Just let me be, eventually someday they'll see what I'm worth
I cross my I's and dot my T's, it makes no sense, but I've learned
Normal to you is not to me, the outcast finally returns (Returns, returns)

[Verse 1]
All I ever wanted was somebody to hear me
And all I ever wanted was somebody to feel me
And everybody wanna tell me that I'm out of my head
When I'm on the mic, that's fine, but that don't scare me
It's been a long time, but I'm back now
Rap pow, welcome to the rap house
Rap pow, will live 'til I pass out
Blackout, blackout, everybody keep on wonderin' if I still rap now
Are you serious?
Anybody out there hearin' this?
Yo, I came in the game as a lyricist
And I'ma leave like that, period
You sniff lines, I write lines
You've now entered in my mind
And you better get ready cause you might find
I'm from a different place, and my kind
It's a little bit different than yours is
Quit snoring, hip-hop isn't dead
It's just been in mournin'
From the moment I quit recording
Quick, record this
Listen, I'm warming up and you're misinformed if
You think that I'm slipping up, this ain't sick enough
Then I'll skip the chorus
I've been here, ain't nobody heard of me?
Yeah I'ma turn this beat to a murder scene
I don't live for the world
I live for the King, I live for the King, focus
Wrote this with emotion
It's hard to get a break when the doors ain't open
It's hard to get a shot when the gun ain't loaded
And it's hard to make a living when nobody wanna notice, hold it
What am I insane maybe? Plain crazy
You put me in a room with a mic you will not restrain me
You do what you wanted but you can't contain me, lazy
Is not a character trait of mine, don't wait in line
This is the current condition of my state of mind

[Chorus]
Don't tell me that this isn't real
Don't tell me this ain't how I feel
This is all I have, all I have

[Verse 2]
All I ever wanted was somebody to get this
All I ever wanted was somebody to play this
Yeah, take my song, put it on their playlist
And get goosebumps every time they play it, rate us
If that's my calling or not, Father, maybe I should just not bother
Go back to that nine-to-five, but I am not a quitter so quit that
I never been a killer but I guarantee I kill tracks
Put them in a coffin, lost in, rip that
Tryin' to make an impact in rap, is that insane?
Well, I guess so
Rap though, better give me that pencil
And you ain't ever gonna make it, it's all mental
I am in a place where I can't let go, agh!
I still work a job and do this, and y'all know what's stupid?
I thought all you had to do was get a record deal, and, your things start moving
But that's not the case, because most of the times'the artists you hear
You keep on thinking that artist is new, but that artist has prolly been at it for years
Yeah, in the back of my mind thinking, am I wasting my time dreamin'?
And I ain't got no money in my wallet, but I guarantee there ain't no way that I am gonna leave this
I need this, I swear to y'all, I need this
And this hip-hop's in my veins, if you cut me I'ma bleed it
And, yo, what you think I write raps for? No reason? No
Take my pain and I put 'em in a song'ever since them pills, they took my mom
I've been a different person, don't try to predict my verses
What you're hearing now is me whether I'm in front or behind that curtain
I stand behind these words here, I'm a Christian but I'm not perfect
Don't tell me to calm down, I'm calm now, listen, I'm just working
Yeah, it might take a minute to get it, but once you get it everything will be crystal clear
I don't think they see my vision here, I don't think they see my vision here!

[Chorus]
Don't tell me that this isn't real
Don't tell me this ain't how I feel
This is all I have, all I have
Don't tell me that this isn't real
Don't tell me this ain't how I feel
This is all I have, all I have
Don't tell me that this isn't real
Don't tell me this ain't how I feel
This is all I have, all I have
All I have
Don't tell me that this isn't real (this isn't real, this isn't real)
This is all that I have, this is all that I have

[Verse 1]
Started with phone conversation and I
Flew out to see you, it's raining outside
We sat by the water and talked about life
Oh
Said you lost your dad, girl I know how that feels
I lost my mom, tryna deal with that still
I guess we connect on our hatred for pills
It's real

[Chorus]
I got you on my mind, baby
I got you on my mind, baby
I got you on my mind, baby
I got you on my mind, I got you on my mind
I got you on my mind, baby
I got you on my mind, I got you on my mind

[Verse 2]
You got me thinking things I never used to
I'm not the phone type, I'd rather be with you
Sometimes I hold back from saying, "I miss you"
But I miss you
I have to admit, on this road I get lonely
But you make me smile every time that you call me
You let me be myself
You don't control me

[Chorus]
I got you on my mind, baby
I got you on my mind, I got you on my mind
I got you on my mind, baby
I got you on my mind, I got you on my mind
I got you on my mind, baby
I got you on my mind, I got you on my mind
I got you on my mind, baby
I got you on my mind, I got you on my mind

[Verse 3]
Laying in my bed, I'm just staring at the ceiling, baby
I just wanna know if you can feel what I'm feeling, baby
Got you on my mind yeah, tell me what the deal is lately
Yeah, deal is lately, deal is lately
I'm a man of my word, girl believe that
I'm a closed book but somehow you learn to read that
Know that I should relax, hate the way I react
Thinking that I'm good but you know I'm 'bout to relapse
Thinking that I'm good but you know I'm 'bout to relapse
Girl I wake up in the morning', all I can think of is you

[Chorus]
I got you on my mind, baby (Oh yeah, yeah)
I got you on my mind, I got you on my mind
I got you on my mind, baby (Don't you know, don't you know it, yeah)
I got you on my mind, I got you on my mind
I got you on my mind, baby (Got you on my mind, baby, I got you on my mind, my mind)
I got you on my mind, I got you on my mind
I got you on my mind, baby (Got you on my mind, baby)
I got you on my mind, I got you on my mind

[Outro]
Got you on my mind
Oh yeah
Baby, I got you on my mind
Oh yeah
I got you on my mind, baby
I got you on my mind, baby
Got you on my mind

[Intro]
Yeah

[Chorus]
(Oh) Some days, I just wanna leave the negativity in my head
I just want relief from my stress
I just want relief from my stress (Oh)
Some days, I don't wanna see or
Have a bunch of people to impress
I just want relief from my stress
Yeah, I just want relief from my stress (Oh)

[Verse 1]
Late nights (Late nights), starin' out the window doin' 85
Got my state of mind
Yeah, walkin' on that gray line
Hopin' that my stress dies
It's like I hate it but I love it at the same time (Oh) (Same time)
Pressure pushin' me from all sides
Insecurities of all kinds (All kinds)
Yeah, I'm a hostage to my own pride
Most important things in life to me are things I know I can't buy (Oh)
Ayy, yeah, it's me in phases
I'm not in the mood, yeah, to meet another stranger
I'm not in the mood, yeah, to have a conversation
And talk about a bunch of things that I don't feel amazed with
Gettin' too close to me (Oh), woo, could be dangerous
I don't like the energy, I leave the situation
All this negativity that I can't get away from
All this negativity, I think I need a break from
I'm thankful, but' (Oh)

[Chorus]
Some days, I just wanna leave the negativity in my head
I just want relief from my stress
I just want relief from my stress (Oh)
Some days, I don't wanna see or
Have a bunch of people to impress
I just want relief from my stress
Yeah, I just want relief from my stress (Oh)

[Verse 2]
Yo, this life got my head spinnin'
Wonder what I'd do if I knew these were my last minutes
Wonder if I had a week to live, would I stay trippin'?
Wastin' every day that I had left tryna sell tickets
Or maybe call my dad (Oh), say I love him and laugh with him
Take a couple days and get away from this fast livin'
I don't love my work the way I did
Man, this whole business has got me feelin' jaded
Friends I had, now they act different, it's all switchin', whoa (Ayy) (Oh)
Yeah, it's pretty hard to watch
Those things you used to love turn to things that you wish you forgot
Real moments that make you question the things that you want's
Got me growin' mentally, but stressin' me out 'til I drop
Over the top (Oh), that's where I live on a daily basis
I always find a way to find the bad in good situations
It's sad, huh?
Yeah, I live my life on the edge, don't want the meds
I'm just tryna get relief from my stress, you know? (Oh)

[Chorus]
Some days, I just wanna leave the negativity in my head
I just want relief from my stress
I just want relief from my stress (Oh)
Some days, I don't wanna see or
Have a bunch of people to impress
I just want relief from my stress
Yeah, I just want relief from my stress (Oh)

[Verse 3]
These stress levels are not healthy
I'm waitin' for that call sayin' records are not selling
I wonder when this all disappears and they forget me
Will I feel like I found who I was or be more empty?
I wonder was I wrong thinkin' this is where God led me
Or did I get involved with somethin' that was too heavy?
I drive until I'm lost and just sit in my car yelling
My inner critic talks, I'm just hopin' that God helps me to stop stressin'
Yeah

[Chorus]
(Oh) Some days (Some days)
I just wanna leave the negativity in my head (I just wanna leave it)
I just want relief from my stress (Yeah, I just wanna leave it)
I just want relief from my stress (Oh)
Some days (Some days), I don't wanna see or
Have a bunch of people to impress (Yeah)
I just want relief from my stress
Yeah, I just want relief from my stress (Oh)

[Outro]
Yeah
Yeah, some days
Yeah, some days
I just wanna leave, yeah
I just wanna leave, yeah

[Intro]
Yeah, look

[Verse 1]
I mean this with love when I say it
I wanna answer the phone when you call me
The problem is, it's 10 a.m. and you're already drinkin'
You're probably already wasted
What's the point in having conversation with somebody that
Won't remember we had conversations, yeah, we always talk about the same things, we just say 'em different
Try to fix it, crazy, isn't it?
You say, "Mom was always proud" and played the videos of us as kids, I get it
I think that both of us live in the past, so we take for granted the present
Maybe next time I'm in Michigan, I'll come and visit
We ain't got a lot in common but both of us miss her
We could sit inside your smoke-filled livin' room, and tear up together, that's real

[Chorus]
I might do some things you don't like
We all make mistakes, that's just life
They might say I changed, that's alright
That's alright, that's alright
That's just my life, my life, my life, my life (My life, my life)
That's just my life, my life, my life, my life (That's just my)
That's just my life, my life, my life, my life (My life, my life)
That's just my life, my life, my life, my life (My life, my life, my life, my)
My life, my life

[Verse 2]
You know my patience is very thin
Wish I was there again
I'm not embarrassed to say that we've always had issues
I'm embarrassed to say that we never took care of 'em, yeah
Pain will always find its way to the surface
No matter how deep you bury him
Growin' up, I felt like no one ever really got me, eventually
I took that out on relationships (Woo!)
I put my arm around you, and I mean it, I love you to death
These are the moments I know I'ma always hold onto and cherish 'em, yeah
Life's about taking chances, making moves
Not about what you did, it's what you do
Build on what you got and learn from what you lose
And never let people distract you from being you

[Chorus]
I might do some things you don't like (Yeah)
We all make mistakes, that's just life (Life)
They might say I changed, that's alright (That's alright)
That's alright, that's alright
That's just my life, my life, my life, my life (My life, my life)
That's just my life, my life, my life, my life (That's just my)
That's just my life, my life, my life, my life (My life, my life)
That's just my life, my life, my life, my life
My life, my life

[Bridge]
Yeah, that's just my, that's just my, that's just my
That's just my, that's just my, that's just my
That's just my, that's just my, that's just my
(Oh no, no)
Yeah, that's just my, that's just my, that's just my
That's just my, that's just my, that's just my
That's just my, that's just my, that's just my
Life

[Outro]
That's just my life, my life, my life, my life (My life, my life)
That's just my life, my life, my life, my life
Yeah, that's just my life, my life, my life, my life (My life, my life)
That's just my life, my life (That's just my, that's just my)
My life, my life
My life, my life
My life, my life
Yeah, that's just my life

[Verse 1]
Yeah (haha)
My name buzzin', ain't no way you could ignore it
I did not come this far so they could ignore me
I am not the one to say, "I'll do it in the mornin'"
I'd rather get it done, don't focus on what's not important
They try to talk to me like they been nothin' but supportive
Appreciate the love, but do not show up on my doorstep
If you ain't about that real, I suggest that you avoid me
If we ain't on the same page, that's the end of story, agh!
You are not a baller 'cause your closet's full of Jordan's
You are not a rich man 'cause you're on the Forbes list
First, I drop the record, then you know I gotta tour it
Real's still the slogan, only difference is there's more of us
The story of my life feels like it's just beginnin' now
I ask you a question, I want answers, not the run-around
You the one that brought it up, but I'm the one to shut it down
If you ain't got the album yet, I brought you one, I'm at your house
Hey!

[Chorus]
All I see is green lights (Green lights) (Woo!)
All I see is green lights (Green lights) (Oh yeah!)
All I spit is real life (Real life) (Yeah!)
Bet you don't know what that's like (That's like) (Huh?)
All I see is green lights (Green lights) (Yeah!), woo!
All I see is green lights, (Green lights) (Woo!), yeah
All I spit is real life (Real life)
I bet you don't know what that's like (That's like)

[Verse 2]
Yeah
I know where I'm goin', I don't let no one distract me
I don't need directions from nobody in the back seat
I don't need these people in my corner tryna gas me
I'd rather have people in my corner tryna check me
Yeah, I walk off the bus a different city than the last week
Let the fans speak, they gon' tell you 'bout the past me
If I'm bein' honest, last year I was in a bad place
Wouldn't say I'm out of it, but don't feel like I can't be, agh!
Who you know droppin' clean records, but they nasty?
I was made for this, I could tell when Mama had me
I hopped right off the table, told my doctor, "I ain't average."
He asked me, "What does that mean?"
I told him, "Get the pen and pad, please."
Who'd a known I'd write something that could change lives?
I don't think y'all fully understand the way you changed mine
I look at the future that's in front of me with both eyes
Three records, three years, I don't like to waste time
Oh yeah!

[Chorus]
All I see is green lights, yeah! (Woo!)
All I see is green lights, haha!
All I spit is real life (Real life)
Bet you don't know what that's like (You don't know!)
All I see is green lights (Green lights), woo!
All I see is green lights (Green lights'haha), yeah!
All I spit is real life (Oh, real life!)
I bet you don't know what that's like (No!)

[Outro]
Hey!
Haha!
All I see is'green lights!
Yeah!
Oh my!
Yeah! (haha)

[Verse]
I'm dedicated, the definition of dedication
Wrote this whole record while I was levitating
Sittin' in my room with the pen and paper, I'm innovative
They've been afraid of me since I was a second grader
I'm the kid on the playground mama told you to never play with
There's levels of music'and I'm in the elevator
Going up to the top floor, look how we elevated
What, you don't know the brand by now? You better get educated
Take both of my arms, rip 'em out the sockets and separate 'em
Forgive me, yeah, I know I get animated
Don't matter, I still write a better record than yours without a hesitation
Never been more motivated
Just look at all the minds I have opened and penetrated
See, I am the voice of all these kids that think things, but never say 'em
That's why they come to my shows wearing the NF hoodies and hats low like we're carrying weapons, ah!
Put the controllers away, it's game over
I promise I'm way colder
The fans keep saying that they're hungry for new music
Well that's pretty convenient 'cause I just made a plate for 'em
And I don't hear what none of y'all are saying
I just sit at the keys feeling the music
Got me thinking I'm Beethoven
The game needs a makeover
If you've been waiting, the wait's over
You ain't notice, y'all about to witness a takeover, I'm home!
Yeah, they waiting on me to match the
Emotion that I had in the last one
What if I don't, they gon' tell me that I'm losing my passion?
If I do, am I repeating my actions?
Yeah, look, "How Could You Leave Us" is massive
There ain't nothing I can write that'll match that
My biggest fear writing this record wasn't putting out trash
It was disappointing myself and the fanbase
Now I want you to picture me:
I'm in a hotel rapping, crying on the floor of the bathroom
Staring in the mirror, my room, hands shaking playing "How Could You Leave Us" through the speakers on my iPhone
Tryna figure out if I'ma always feel the way that I feel or maybe someday I can learn to be happy
Or maybe I can't be, 'cause if the music ain't emotional enough, are they gon' call me a has-been?
Pain's always been the root of my music
If I cut it off, how am I supposed to keep growing
If I let it go, won't my whole career be in ruins?
That's when I realized this whole conversation is stupid
I never cared to impress people that don't even know me
I just write what I feel, somehow it started a movement
Trying to enjoy a career, but I don't know how to do it
When I spend all of my time being afraid I'ma lose it!
But, then I figured out the reason they follow me
The reason why these fans surrounding me
It's not 'cause I'm a "Rap God"
I don't need you people to bow to me
All they ever did was doubt on me, now everyone's proud of me
Acknowledge me or not, you ain't ignoring the following
I'm just teaching 'em something they couldn't learn in they colleges
This is for the kids feeling like they live at the bottom and every day of they lives, feels like it's darker than Halloween!
Yeah, you ain't alone out there, look around you'we got a lot of fans in here
Couple hundred thousand, that's what we did last year
Listen to Intro III, trying to kill my fear
They'll get that in a minute
We about to shatter the critics
I am a savage, admit it
A lot of baggage I live in
That's why the passion is different
Really don't care if they get it
We're only three records in it and this is just the beginning
I'm home!

[Outro]
Real music

[Verse 1]
Talk to you with my hands tied
Walk towards you on a fine line
Everybody has a dark side
I feel embarrassed when they see mine
Rain falling from my dark skies
Clouds parting, but it's all lies
Shouldn't I see the sunshine now?
Wonder how I look in God's eyes
Am I a good person or a lost one?
Will this feel worth it when I'm all done?
Will I feel ashamed or like who I was?
Will the pain vanish or will more come?
Will I stay numb or regain love?
Maybe someday have a taste of freedom?
Will I take the poison out of my blood?
Or just leave it there inside of my lungs?
I know (Know know, know)
I should let you go, hands are feeling cold
Just leave me alone (No, no, no)
I just want control, I feel so exposed
Liars in my home (No, no, no)
Please do not provoke, noose around my soul, I cut down a rope
They don't want me happy, they don't want me fixed
They don't want me better, they just want me broke
Talk but never listen, at least I admit it
Block out all my vision, watchin' me diminish
That's my favorite pastime, I know nothing different
Tell me something different, I don't see the difference
I just feel offended, I just feel defensive
Why don't you accept me? I just need acceptance
Time is of the essence, don't like how we spend it
You just want perfection, I need you to let me

[Chorus]
Let me go, let me go, let me go, let me go
Let me go, let me go, let me go, let me go
Let me go, let me go, let me go, let me go
Let me go, let me go, let me go, let me go

[Verse 2]
Why'd you say I don't belong here? (Huh?)
Fill a bucket full of my tears (Huh?)
Pour it out the water, all of my insecurities whenever I'm scared
I watch 'em grow and say I don't care
I pray to God to ask if hope's real
And if it is, then I was thinking maybe You could introduce us, we ain't met still
Yeah, my chest feels like a blade's in it
Who put it there? I think they did it
Out the cell now, where am I headed?
Am I Hell-bound? Will I find Heaven?
Will I feel better or just regret it?
If I let you go and find the seven letters
I've been looking for, it's like it's never endin'
Open all the doors and let the peace enter
I'm (So, so, so)
Pitiful at times, miserable inside
They want me to hide (No, no, no)
How can I survive? Change your state of mind
I should say goodbye (No, no, no)
They want me to beg, they want me to plead, they want me to die
They just want me dead, they just want me hurt
Don't want me to live, don't want me alive
Stop with the pretending, I don't feel respected
I just feel rejected, I don't like rejection
You promise protection, I don't feel protected
I just feel neglected, how can I respect it?
I'll teach them a lesson, I pick up the weapon
Aim in your direction, shoot at my reflection
Shatter my perception, hate it when I'm desperate
You just want perfection, I want you to let me

[Chorus]
Let me go, let me go, let me go, let me go
Let me go, let me go, let me go, let me go
Let me go, let me go, let me go, let me go
Let me go, let me go, let me go, let me go (Let me go)

[Intro]
Mm, mm
Mm, mm

[Verse 1]
I miss the days when I had a smile on my face and
Wasn't so caught up in all of the small things
Wasn't so adamant that I could handle everything alone
And wasn't so cautious and always exhausted
And actually listened to things that my heart said, heart said
Ridin' my bike, just ridin' my bike
Not overthinkin' my life
Not always wonderin' if I'm a likable person
Or someone that nobody likes
Not always stressed about money or losin' my job
Or scared I ain't makin' a flight
Not always goin' to bed every night
With this knot in my stomach that never unwinds
What happened to me? Yeah, what happened to me?
When did I start to believe I wasn't worth it
Then question my purpose to breathe?
Wonderin' who I should be
Happiness out of my reach
Scared to get back on my feet
Need to get rid of what's detrimental, but it's hard to let go
When the thing that hurts you help you get to your dreams
See, I miss the days when I wasn't so faded
Love wasn't always invasive, I could embrace it
Just innocent, waitin', not always livin' in anguish
When did I break and become overtaken?
What was the moment I caved and
Gave away all of my faith and made a replacement?
I miss the days when, I miss the days when'

[Chorus]
I miss the smiles we had when we were young (Oh)
I miss the memories of feeling love (Oh)
I miss us runnin' underneath the sun (Oh)
Staring out the window when the rain would come (Oh)
I miss the smiles we had when we were kids, yeah (Oh)
I feel like life was so much simpler then, yeah (Oh)
When we had joy and we were innocent (Oh)
I'd give it all to feel that way again, way again

[Verse 2]
Give me my mind back, yeah
Give me my mind back
The one that told me I was worth somethin' when I fall flat
Yeah, fall flat
The one that told me I was worth somethin' when I'm off track
Back when my imagination wasn't in a cage and it was free to run fast
Yeah, give me my mind back
Yeah, give me my, give me my mind back
Before it was hijacked and wasn't described as
A place of limitation, always indicating I can't
Handle everything from my past
Handed anything it dissects 'til I'm depressed
I know I'm blessed, but I'm cursed too
Take me back when I was happy, but I wasn't actin'
Vulnerable but didn't see it like some kind of weakness
Or a thing that's unattractive
Had emotion, but I learned to mask it
Didn't know what I was runnin' after
Didn't know the older I would grow
The more I'd lose control and take in all the baggage
It's really sad when everything you thought was stable crashes
Everything you thought would take the sadness
Really only made it deeper, got me off the deep end askin'
Will we ever feel like we imagine?
Will we ever feel like we adapted?
Will we ever feel like we did back then?
Just take me back when, just take me back when

[Chorus]
I miss the smiles we had when we were young (Oh)
I miss the memories of feeling love (Oh)
I miss us runnin' underneath the sun (Oh)
Staring out the window when the rain would come (Oh)
I miss the smiles we had when we were kids, yeah (Oh)
I feel like life was so much simpler then, yeah (Oh)
When we had joy and we were innocent (Oh)
I'd give it all to feel that way again, way again

[Bridge]
Oh-oh-oh (Oh)
Oh-oh-oh (Way again)
Oh-oh-oh (Mm)
Oh-oh-oh (Way again, way again)
Yeah
Oh-oh-oh (Oh)
(Had when we were kids)
Oh-oh-oh (Oh)
(So much simpler then)
Oh-oh-oh (Oh)
(And we were innocent)
Oh-oh-oh (Oh)
Yeah

[Chorus]
I miss the smiles we had when we were young (Oh)
I miss the memories of feeling love (Oh)
I miss us runnin' underneath the sun (Oh)
Staring out the window when the rain would come (Oh)
I miss the smiles we had when we were kids, yeah (Oh)
I feel like life was so much simpler then, yeah (Oh)
When we had joy and we were innocent (Oh)
I'd give it all to feel that way again, way again (Oh)

[Post-Chorus]
Oh-oh-oh (Oh)
Oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh

[Outro]
Mm, mm
Mm, mm

[Verse 1]
Look, I don't know what's gotten into me
I could be off of my rocker potentially
Bigger I get, the more they thinkin' less of me
Don't be the one to insult my integrity
Put down the whistle, I'm done with you referees
Y'all don't know nothing, you think you ejected me
'Til I show up in the game, like, "Remember me?"
I gotta make it, these people depend on me
Ayy, that's how I'm living these days
Threaten my wife, keep digging that grave
I had a job making minimum wage
Told myself that I gotta get paid
Prove myself, yeah, get up my grades
Walk into class like, "Gimme that A"
Think I'm trash? Put a bag in your face
And I put you by the road like, "Look, we're the same!"
Here's a reminder that I still spit
Think I need to advise you to watch your lip
Or at least realize that I'm not no kid
Don't Google my name tryna find my crib
Write a pop song, then I write a song like this
Do a lot wrong? Doesn't matter, I learn quick
I'm an outlaw, my brain has no fence
Doesn't matter either way to me 'cause even if it did
I would destroy it (Woo, woo, woo)
Used to be employee, now I'm employer
Making big deals, now I gotta get lawyers
People tell me to relax and enjoy it
But when I kick back, I see warnings
So much time might pass, can't ignore it
Every time I rap and I'm recording
Might be my last so I absorb it 'cause

[Chorus]
I gotta make it or make it
I gotta make it or make it, yeah
I gotta make it or make it
Man, these are the options, these are the options
I gotta make it or make it
I gotta make it or make it, yeah
I gotta make it or make it
Man, these are the options, these are the options
I gotta make it or make it
I gotta make it or make it, woo
I gotta make it or make it
Man, these are the options, these are the options
I gotta make it or make it
I gotta make it or make it, woo
I gotta make it or make it
Man, these are the options, these are the options (Yeah)

[Verse 2]
Tool bag without the pliers
Intros without the choirs
New car without the tires
Music without the writers
UFC without the fighters
Smoking without the fire
Cigarettes without the lighter
Austin Powers, no Michael Myers, that's me
If I ain't got the bars, you see
Something ain't right like I'm incomplete
Outcast, yes, I'm a different breed
If you disagree, make 'em all retreat
Act like a boss when I compete
Take my thoughts into hyperspeed
When it's all gone and I hit my peak
At least I'll know that I took that leap
'Cause life is a process
And I am not here for the nonsense
Losing everything I worked for likes to weigh on my conscience
That why I block out the comments
Who's next? Who's next?
I don't know, I ain't been watching
Closing my ear to the gossip
I gotta make it or make it
Man, these are the options, ooh
No forfeit, my course different
Changed flows and I'm bored with it
More livid, never more driven, I avoid timid
Try to tell me I could never be the G.O.A.T. of rap, I ignore limits
I was born with this, you're trippin' thinkin' I'm slippin'
I'm enjoying this
Look at me, I'm on the tour selling more tickets
Even if the fourth record didn't sell a copy, I'ma do it like a hobby
I ain't quitting 'til the Lord tell me

[Chorus]
I gotta make it or make it
I gotta make it or make it, yeah
I gotta make it or make it
Man, these are the options, these are the options
I gotta make it or make it
I gotta make it or make it, woo
I gotta make it or make it
Man, these are the options, these are the options
I gotta make it or make it
I gotta make it or make it, woo
I gotta make it or make it
Man, these are the options, these are the options
I gotta make it or make it
I gotta make it or make it, woo
I gotta make it or make it
Man, these are the options, these are the options

[Outro]
Ayy, these are the options
Ah, these are the options
Woo, these are the options
Yeah, these are the options

[Verse 1]
When I die, put my ashes in a trash bag
I don't care where they go
Don't waste your money on my gravestone
I'm more concerned about my soul
Everybody's gon' die
Don't everybody live though
Sometimes I look up to the sky
And wonder'

[Chorus]
"Do You see us down here, oh Lord?" (Oh Lord) Oh Lord? (Oh Lord)
Do You see us down here, oh Lord? (Oh Lord) Oh Lord? (Oh Lord)
Do You see us down here, oh Lord? (Oh Lord, oh) Oh Lord? (Oh Lord)
Do You see us down here, oh Lord? (Oh Lord, oh) Oh Lord? (Oh Lord, oh Lord')

[Verse 2]
Listen! (Listen)
Yeah, everybody wants change (Wants change, wants change')
Don't nobody wanna change though (Change though, change though')
Don't nobody wanna pray (Pray, pray, pray, pray')
'Til they got something to pray fo' (Pray fo', pray fo'')
Know everybody's gon' die (Gon' die, gon' die')
But don't everybody live though (Live though')
Sometimes I look up to the sky (Sky, sky, sky')
And wonder'

[Chorus]
"Do You see us down here, oh Lord?" (Oh Lord) (Yeah, yeah, yeah') Oh Lord? (Oh Lord)
Do You see us down here, oh Lord? (Oh Lord) Oh Lord? (Oh Lord)
Do You see us down here, oh Lord? (Oh Lord, oh) Oh Lord? (Oh Lord)
Do You see us down here, oh Lord? (Oh Lord, oh) Oh Lord? (Oh Lord, oh Lord')

[Verse 3]
It's easy to blame God but harder to fix things
We look in the sky like, "Why ain't You listening?"
Watchin' the news in our livin' rooms on the big screens
And talkin' about, "If God's really real, then where is He?" (Is He, is He')
You see the same God that we're sayin' might not even exist
Becomes real to us but only when we're dyin' in bed
When you're healthy, it's like we don't really care for Him then
"Leave me alone God. I'll call You when I need You again." (Need You again)
Which is funny, everyone will sleep in the pews
Then blame God for our problems like He's sleepin' on you
We turn our backs on Him; what do you expect Him to do?
It's hard to answer prayers when nobody's prayin' to you (Prayin' to you)
I look around at this world we walk on (Walk on)
It's a smack in the face; don't ever tell me there's no God (No God)
And if there isn't, then what are we here for?
And what are y'all doin' down there? I don't know, Lord, ah!

[Chorus]
Oh Lord (Oh Lord) Oh Lord (Oh Lord)
Do You see us? Do You see us?
Do you see us down here, oh Lord? (Oh Lord) Oh Lord? (Oh Lord)
Do You see us? Do You see us?
Do you see us down here, oh Lord? (Oh Lord, oh) Oh Lord? (Oh Lord)
Can You see us? Can You see us?
Do you see us down here, oh Lord? (Oh Lord, oh) Oh Lord? (Oh Lord) (Oh)
Can You see us? Can You see us?

[Outro]
Do You see us down here, oh Lord?
Do You see us down here, oh Lord?
Can You see us down here, oh Lord?
Can You see us down here, oh Lord?
Oh Lord, oh Lord
Can You see us? (Can You see us?)
Can't You see us? (Can't You see us? Can't You see us?')

[Intro]
Yeah

[Verse 1]
Yeah
Only time you ever call me
Is when you feelin' like
"Don't nobody else wanna listen"
When's the last time you saw me?
You probably don't remember that
'Cause that was back then, you were different
I don't wanna hear the sorries
I'm tired of all the talkin'
To be honest, I would rather see a difference
Yeah, you pass me in the hallway
But you ain't say a word to me
Lately, all I ever feel is distant
You don't care that you lost me
What's wrong with ya?
Had a picture of you sittin' on the dash in the car with me
Now it's in my closet with the other ones
Sittin' in a box I don't wanna open up
You took it all from me
Told me you would die for me
Yeah, all you ever do is lie to me
Wish that I could say that this has come as surprise to me
Told me that I never took the time
And now you ain't got the time for me, yeah

[Chorus]
I just wanna know oh, oh, oh, oh
When did you get so cold? Oh, oh, oh
What happened to your soul? Oh, oh, oh
Don't you see me? (See me, see me)

[Verse 2]
Yeah
We used to talk like best friends
I remember that
I guess I don't know what happened to us
Now you got me questionin' what trust is
You told me you would be there for me
Yeah, but you ain't really mean it, did ya?
Now you wanna jump ship
Leave me here alone
Well, I'm used to it
Everybody else did
Who you havin' fun with?
Don't tell me, I don't wanna know
Every time I ask, I just feel sick
You're the one that jumped in
Told me you had feelings
Now you tryna tell me that is not true
I ain't gotta clue who I'm lookin' at right now
But I know the person that I'm lookin' at is not you
Yeah, they say that you are who you hang with
Maybe that's the reason you been changin'
Maybe that's the reason why I'm feelin' like you're dangerous
And every time we talk it's like I'm talkin' to a stranger, ah

[Chorus]
I just wanna know, oh, oh, oh
When did you get so cold? Oh, oh, oh
What happened to your soul? Oh, oh, oh
Don't you see me? (See me, see me)
I thought that we were close, oh, oh
But now that door is closed, oh, oh
When did we lose control? Oh, oh, oh
Guess you don't need me (Need me, need me)
I just wanna know, oh, oh, oh
When did you get so cold? Oh, oh, oh
What happened to your soul? Oh, oh, oh
Don't you see me? (See me, see me)
I thought that we were close, oh, oh
But now that door is closed, oh, oh
When did we lose control? Oh, oh, oh
Guess you don't need me (Need me, need me)

[Intro]
You spend your life in a dream that you can't escape
'Cause you live your life in a coma, you're never awake
If you'd open your eyes then maybe you'd see what's at stake
You're sleeping, you're sleeping

[Verse 1]
You make a lot of money and you live in a mansion
And pretty much got everything that you could ever imagine
But you feel like even though you got everything in the world
You got nothing
So what you do then is you start going backwards
You runnin' in a direction
And you lookin' for something that isn't real
And all you know is that you just gotta have it
What you're doin' is sleepin'
And thinking that you're awake and you're not
And the problem is that you don't know what you're after
So you put everything that you have into what you do
Hoping that one day maybe you don't have to feel like you're empty
But as you get older a lot of weight on your shoulders is getting heavy
Then you look back and you start to regret things
You only get one life
And every time you lookin' at yours
You feel like everything you have is a waste!
And the problem and the reason you could never fill a hole in your life
Is because you were never awake

[Pre-Chorus]
You spend your life in a dream that you can't escape
'Cause you live your life in a coma, you're never awake

[Chorus]
Wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up!
Wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up!
Wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up!
Wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up!

[Verse 2]
You wake up in the morning
But you feel like you never got up and go to work
And you feelin' like you ain't got a purpose
And you tryna get motivated but everything you do turns into a mess
Like you ain't nothing but worthless
And, yo, you look around
A lot of these other people you lookin' at
To you, you describe as perfect
So you point a finger at God and tell him to do his job
And fix ya life up 'cause nothin' is workin'!
And you will try to hide it and make it seem like it's nothin'
But really you feel like everything is crashin' around you
And you developed a problem in trusting in other people
Which later became an issue that would mentally pound you!
You only get one life
But every time you lookin' at yours you feel like all you ever see are mistakes
And the problem and the reason you could never move forward in life
Is because you were never awake!
Wake up

[Pre-Chorus]
You spend your life in a dream that you can't escape
'Cause you live your life in a coma, you're never awake

We go back, remember criss-cross and hopscotch? (Hopscotch)
You the one that hold me down when the block's hot (Hot)
I make your dreams come true when you wake up (Dream)
And your look's just the same without no make-up
Had to pull up on your mama, see what you're made of (Mama)
Ain't gotta worry 'bout 'em commas 'cause my cake up (Cake)
You can run inside my life from that fame bus (Skrrt)
'Cause I promise, when we step out you'll be famous (Yeah)
Modern day Bonnie and Clyde what they named us (Why?)
'Cause when we pull up'brt-brt!'all angles

[Verse 2: Chance The Rapper]
Uh, she beat her face up with that new Chanel
She like the price, she see the ice, it make her coochie melt
When I met her in the club I asked her who she felt
Then she went and put that booty on that Gucci belt
We don't got no label
She say she want bottles, she ain't got no table
She don't got no bed frame, she don't got no tables
We just watchin' Netflix, she ain't got no cable, okay though
Plug, plug, plug, I'm the plug for her
She want a nigga that pull her hair and hold the door for her
Baby, that's only me, bitch, it okay with me
Baby, okay, okay though

Lookin' for the one?
Well, bitch, you're lookin' at the one
I'm the best yet, and yet my best is yet to come
'Cause I've been lookin' for somebody
Not just any fuckin' body
Don't make me catch a body
That's for any and everybody
Oh my God, she hit me up all day, get no response
Bitch, you blow my high
That's like turnin' gold to bronze, roll my eyes
And when she on the molly, she a zombie
She think we Clyde and Bonnie
But it's more like Whitney and Bobby
God, forgive me! Tunechi F finessin', I'm a legend
Straight up out the Crescent
Fly your bae down for the Essence
For the record I knew Khaled when that boy was spinnin' records
Mula Gang, winnin' record
I'm just flexin' on my exes, oh God

[Pre-Chorus: Justin Bieber & DJ Khaled]

Spinning and it's wet just like it came from Maytag

Diamonds ain't nothing when I'm rockin' with ya
Diamonds ain't nothing when I'm shinin' with ya

Fuck you 'til you're burned out, cremation
Make it cream, yeah, Wu-Tang
Throw that ass back, bouquet
Call me and I can get it juicy
I can tell you're gone off the D'USS'
Careful mama watch what you say
You talking to me like ya new bae
Girl, talking like you tryna do things
Now that pipe got her running like she Usain, baby
You made me drown in it, touche, baby
I'm carrying that water, Bobby Boucher, baby
You know I'ma slaughter like I'm Jason
Bust it, why you got it on safety?
White girl wasted on brown liquor

[Verse 1: Drake]
Yeah, I go on and on
Can't understand how I last so long
I must have the superpowers
Last 223 thousand hours
And it's 'cause I'm off of CC
And I'm off the Hennessy
And like your boy from Compton said
You know this dick ain't free!
I got girls that I shoulda made pay for it
Got girls that I shoulda made wait for it
I got girls that'll cancel a flight back home
Stay another day for it
You got attitude on na-na
And your pussy on agua
And your stomach on flat flat
And your ass on what's that?
And, yeah, I need it all right now
Last year I had drama, girl not right now
I was never gon' chat what we talkin' about
You the only one I know could fit it all in her...man

[Chorus: Drake]
I always wonder if you ask yourself (Ask yourself)
Is it just me? (Just me)
Is it just me?
Or is this sex so good I shouldn't have to fuck for free?
Oh, is it just me?
Yeah, is it just me?
Or is this sex so good I shouldn't have to...

[Verse 2: Drake]
Fuck for free
I know you workin' day and night to get a college degree
Bet nobody that you've been with even know you a freak, right?
You know you only do that with me, right?
Yeah, double checkin' on you
You know I never put the pressure on you
You know that you make your own mind up
You knew what it was when you signed up
Now you gotta run it up
I be out of words, tryna sum it up
Girl, you throw it back like one love
Even let me slash on the tour bus
Yeah I talk to her but she don't do enough
Even though you in the hood I'm still pullin' up
Dip, dip, straight to your doorstep
This the real thing, can you feel the force yet

[Chorus: Drake]
I always wonder if you ask yourself (Ask yourself)
Is it just me? (Just me)
Is it just me?
Or is this sex so good I shouldn't have to fuck for free?

Money counter go *brrrr* when you sellin' out the Garden
Four-car garage, pornstar m'nage
Birdman go *brrrr* 'cause he know this shit retarded
Fuck her on the floor 'fore we make it to the bed
That's what yo' ass really call started from the bottom
Yes, Lord, OVO Sound, man, I'm proud of my niggas
Knew that we would make it, never doubted my niggas
All my bitches love me; if I had a baby mama
She would probably be richer than a lot of you niggas
Ayy, that's luxury, dawg
Day-one niggas, man, y'all stuck with me, dawg
Ever since YouTube, niggas been callin' me the leader of the new school; fuck with me, dawg, yeah

Your bitch all in my photographs
Ho niggas got hate for me
Big homies all certified
Nothin' niggas gon' take from me
Follow codes, study game
Feed fam, nigga, fuck fame
All black, my whip foreign
These bad hoes keep tiptoein'
Down in Turks and Caicos
Dope boy, that's my dress code
All I hug is blood, nigga
Khaled, that's my flesh, ho
All I want is love, nigga
Money bring that stress though
Smoke good, I love life
Strip club like e'ry night
E'ry night my same niggas
Day one, straight menace (Rozay!)

[Chorus: Drake]
No new friends, no new friends
No new friends, no, no new (Huh, Maybach Music)
Still here with my day one niggas
So you hear me say no new friends

[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]
Ugh, I'm here with my niggas
I'm too high to be friendly
They throw dirt on my name
Well, that's why they still dig me
And I'm tired of all this hatin'
I thank God for my patience
I thank God for my homies
I wish we could trade places
Bitch, we good-fellas
Boy, all them niggas with you, they just pall bearers
And if we ball, catch us
Remember sip slow, live fast
Young Money, stay young
I been Cash Money since day one (Tunechi!)

[Chorus: Drake]
No new friends, no new friends (Khaled fuck wit me)
No new friends, no, no new
Still here with my day one niggas
So you hear me say no new friends (Sue em)

[Verse 1: Drake]
Uhh, I'm getting so throwed
I ain't went this hard since I was 18
Apologize if I say, anything I don't mean
Like "what's up with your best friend?
We could all have some fun, believe me
And what's up with these new niggas?
And why they think it all comes so easy?"
But get it while you here, boy
'Cause all that hype don't feel the same next year, boy
Yeah and I'll be right here in my spot
With a little more cash than I already got
Trippin' off you 'cause you had your shot
With my skin tanned and my hair long
And my fans who been so patient
Me and 40 back to work but we still smell like a vacation
Hate the rumors, hate the bullshit
Hate these fucking allegations
I'm just feeling like the throne is for the taking
Watch me take it

[Chorus: Drake]
All I care about is money and the city that I'm from
I'ma sip until I feel it, I'ma smoke it 'til it's done
And I don't really give a fuck, and my excuse is that I'm young
And I'm only getting older, somebody shoulda told ya
I'm on one, yeah, fuck it I'm on one
Yeah, I said "I'm on one", fuck it I'm on one
Two white cups and I got that drink
Could be purple, it could be pink
Depending on how you mix that shit
Money to be got and I'ma get that shit
'Cause I'm on one, I said "Fuck it, I'm on one"

[Verse 2: Rick Ross]
I'm burning purple flowers, it's burning my chest
I bury the most cash and burning the rest
Walking on the clouds, suspended in thin air
Do ones beneath me recognize the red bottoms I wear?
Burner in the belt, move the kids to the hills (Boss)
Bend shawty on the sink, do it for the thrill
Kiss you on ya neck and tell ya "everything is great"
Even though I'm out on bond and might be facing' 8
Still running with the same niggas 'til the death of me
Never seen a million cash, gotta count it carefully
Ever made love to the woman of your dreams
In a room full of money out in London and she screams?
Baby, I could take ya there
Call Marc Jacobs personally to make a pair
So yeah, we on one, the feeling ain't fair (Khaled)
And it's double M G until I get the chair

[Chorus: Drake]
All I care about is money and the city that I'm from
I'ma sip until I feel it, I'ma smoke it 'til it's done
And I don't really give a fuck, and my excuse is that I'm young
And I'm only getting older, somebody shoulda told ya
I'm on one, yeah, fuck it I'm on one
Yeah, I said "I'm on one", fuck it I'm on one
Two white cups and I got that drink
Could be purple, it could be pink
Depending on how you mix that shit
Money to be got and I'ma get that shit
'Cause I'm on one, I said "fuck it, I'm on one"

[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]
I walk around the club, fuck everybody
And all my niggas got that Heat, I feel like Pat Riley
Yeah, too much money, ain't enough money
You know the feds listening, nigga what money?
I'm a maid nigga, I should dust something
You niggas on the bench, like the bus coming
Huh, ain't nothing sweet but the Swishers
I'm focused might as well say "cheese" for the pictures
Ohh, I'm about to go Andre the Giant
You a sell out, but I ain't buying
Chopper dissect a nigga like science
Put an end to your world like the Mayans
This a celebration bitches, Mazel tov
It's a slim chance I fall, Olive Oyl
Tunechi be the name, don't ask me how I got it
I'm killin' these hoes I swear I'm tryna stop the violence
(Young Mula baby, YMCMB)

[Chorus: Drake]
All I care about is money and the city that I'm from
I'ma sip until I feel it, I'ma smoke it 'til it's done
And I don't really give a fuck, and my excuse is that I'm young
And I'm only getting older, somebody shoulda told ya
I'm on one, yeah, fuck it I'm on one
Yeah, I said "I'm on one", fuck it I'm on one
Two white cups and I got that drink
Could be purple, it could be pink
Depending on how you mix that shit
Money to be got and I'ma get that shit
'Cause I'm on one, I said "fuck it, I'm on one"

Every night another bag comin'
I ain't been asleep since '96
I ain't seen the back of my eyelids
I been speedin' through life with no safety belt
One on one with the corner with no safety help
I perform like Josh Norman, I ain't normal, nigga
Just a project nigga out in Beverly Hills, California, nigga
That Wraith talk, that's foreign, nigga
Special cloth talk here
All my niggas from the mud damn near
All my niggas millionaires
We gon' take it there, I swear
You gon' think a nigga's psychic
You ain't seen nothin' like this
I should probably copyright this
I promise they ain't gonna like this

[Chorus: Future & JAY-Z]
I got them keys, the keys, the keys (Ah!)
I got them keys, the keys, the keys
I got them keys, the keys, the keys (Slang)
I got them keys, the keys, the keys (Slang)

No, no, you bitches ain't, bitches ain't even on my radar (Swish)

[Verse 2: Jay Z]
I got a bag for lawyers, like, "Fuck your charges!"
Hop out the courtroom, like, "What charges?"
Big pimpin' on your court steps
Case y'all ain't notice, I ain't lost yet
Y'all know it's one of one
Soon as you hear that, "uh-uh", uh (Right)
Y'all know the difference right?
From rap facts and fiction, right? Shit
Real life I'm like HOV, real life I'm life goals
In real life they're like me? In real life I'm like, "No."
My swag different (Mm), that bag different (Uh-huh)
My wife Beyonc' (Yeah), I brag different (Uh)
My baby Blue (What else?)
I dream in color (What else?)
That's too much flavor (What else?)
I don't rap to suckas (Ha!)
God bless you all, I only talk special talk
I only talk special cloth
Said I only talk special, ah!

[Chorus: Future & JAY-Z]
I got them keys, the keys, the keys
I got them keys, the keys, the keys (Wraith talk)
I got them keys, the keys, the keys (Uh)

I know the judge, I'ma shoot him some chips
I got them keys, the keys, the keys (Slang)
I got them keys, the keys, the keys (Hah)

[Post-Chorus: Future & JAY-Z]
Radar, radar, oh, bitches ain't even on my radar (Swish)

[Verse 2: Chris Brown]
I had some problems back home (So I heated up)
I ain't with that bullshit at all (Then I laid it down)
Maybe it's that Virginia in me (Nigga, say something)
Have a young nigga go so hard (And stay stunting)
Oh, but through it all you stuck with me
Through it all you never ducked off like them cowards
When it hit me, get me?
Girl, I swear to God you the real one and you know it
And I don't hurt anyone of y'all for the real one and you know it
And I hold it down
Started from the bed, ended up on the floor
And I lift that ass up off the ground
I'ma put you on my shoulders, let me give you what's in store
Girl, you deserve it, all the time you been serving
Away from the realest nigga in here, I'ma take you away
And I'll hold you down, I'ma hold you down

[Verse 1: JAY-Z]
V12, see ya, 12 (Bye)
I do the whole dash with no seatbelt
Screamin', "Free my nigga Meek Mill"
Niggas can't wheelie in this free world
Meanwhile Georgie Porgie Cinnamon sendin' me threats
Save your breath, you couldn't beat a flight of steps
Try that shit with a grown man
I'll kill that fuckboy with my own hand
And hop back in the coupe (Woo, woo)
Let's go back to the mud, I'll hop right out the suit
Save all that woopty-woop
Let's let the money talk, let the Uzi shoot
No jewels in this Patek Philippe
It's complicated, three million apiece
Sheesh, that's how we do time
Dujac by the mag, that's how we do wine
91 thousand for a wine bill
Keep it real with you, that was Juan's bill
My whole team ball
Everybody's a star but the team ball
'61 with the thing off
Me and Blue havin' a sing-off
That's a raspberry beret
The kind you find in a second-hand store
That's a vintage piece
Kind that make haters kiss their teeth, you can't buy this new
I had the 'Bach-bach-bach, you know how I do
Two-tone with the powder blue (Woo)
Realest shit to come out the stu'
Khaled is valid, every word is true
What these niggas gon' do without us, Gu'?

[Chorus: Future]

[Verse 2: JAY-Z]
I chopped the top off in Otis
Ridin' 'round town with the FLOTUS
One-point-five for the Landaulet
Bey, put these fuckboys on notice (Fuckboys on notice)

[Verse 3: Beyonc']
How I'm the only lady here, still the realest nigga in the room?
I break the internet, top two and I ain't number two
My body, my ice, my cash, all real, I'm a triple threat
Fuck it up and then leave, come back, fuck it up and leave again
Top off the coupe and it look like Freaknik
In the hood, hollerin', "Free Meek"
Two deep, it's just me and Jay
Just posted in them courtside seats
Woo, I'm like, "hol' up"
Woo, I might roll up
If they're tryna party with the queen
They gon' have to sign a non-disclosure, ayy

[Chorus: Beyonc' & Future]
I took the top off the Maybach, yeah

(This is, this is...)
Doing what I gotta do, aaaa
What up though?
We the best music...
I guess I'm on my Don shit
What that mean?
I'ma go, aaaa
DJ Khaled

[Verse 1: Big Sean]
Straight up, late nights mixed with early days
It'll probably be that way until the pearly gates
Stress weighing on me, they want me to nervous break
These hoes showing fake love when I prefer the hate, man
Sheesh, at least if you real then I have to respect it
Realize the energy you give is what you manifested
So understand we positive as could be
The vision is still intact, the show is fresh out of seats
Boy it's never going south 'less we down in South Beach
Khaled on the jet skis, preaching what you believe in
Everything fast 'cept the food, watch what we eating
If it add a couple years to our life, then we might go vegan
Woah, I hear a little bit of me in all your favorite rappers
You know it's true, bitch I need respect due
Now or later, either way I'ma take it
Just like it's fuckin' taxes
No wonder I'm on fire, I done been to hell and back bitch
Lately I been living life in detachment
I practice seven spiritual laws and cut off distractions
We been all in the Hollywood Hills, and never been acting
Detroit gave me an accent and Christ gave me his passion
Father help us, police doing target practice with real bodies
Mommas in the streets, crying, standing over a still body
Niggas over stressing, we under investigation
Every day off to the races, can't fuck with you if you racist
Beat your ass until you purple
They can't even tell what your race is
Doctor King meet Dr. Dre
Except this doctor lost all his patience
Have you tied up in a basement
With you and your partner facing adjacent
Until you deposit payment or reparations
If you shoot me then you gotta deal with a holy me
It feel like I'm finally free and unlock my spirit with the holy key

[Chorus: Betty Wright & DJ Khaled]
And I'ma celebrate it for a long time
They tried but couldn't break me, now it's all mine
Surrounded by my angels and we all shine
Holy, holy, holy, holy key
And I'ma celebrate it for a long time
They tried but couldn't break me, now it's all mine
Surrounded by my angels and we all shine
Holy, holy, holy,  holy key

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
Everything I touch may disintegrate into dust (uh huh)
Everything I trust may dishonor me in disgust (come on)
Everything is everything, affidavits and wedding rings
Out for blood on my higher horse, I report what it was
I don't wear crosses no more, Yeshua's coming back
I ain't scared of losses no more, I see life in that
I don't resonate with the concept of love and hate
Cause your perspective is less effective and rather fake
The universe and the heavens work in my DNA
Kendrick said "Fuck Mother Earth," that's PSA
The land of the wicked, the foundation of Lucifer's spirit
Walking zombies and spellcatchers, I pray for forgiveness
Uncle Bobby and Paul June is lost again
The underworld and the fourth dimension, my family's in
The big money, the fast cars, my life produced
The blocks I connected while re-building this Rubik's cube
So what you look up to?
Fame and fortune, bitches, Porsches
Sources with designer thing
Brand endorsement joining forces with sorcerers signing me
Law enforcement their forces, tortures us with violent speed
Fuck your boss's employment my joy is to see all you bleed
Two new Royce's with choices of color my desire need
Crab and Oyster with gorgeous abortions, I require thee
Flesh and poison the point is the reason
You won't die in peace
Open door for my boy, now they eating, we say, finally
I destroy and divorce what you eating, don't you hire me
Tape recording my voices and tweak it
Let's play hide and seek
War distortion and forfeit this evening, you should try at least
I'm restoring the portrait of feasting, nigga, I am beast
I don't like to sleep, I'm up like coyote, I might OD
Hair like ODB, I'm off a higher need
Khaled is valid, I been looking for inspiration
But when you the only king, you the only one in the matrix

[Chorus: Betty Wright & DJ Khaled]
Oh yeah, mhm yeah
And I'ma celebrate it for a long time
They tried but couldn't break me, now it's all mine
Surrounded by my angels and we all shine
Holy, holy, holy, holy key
And I'ma celebrate it for a long time
They tried but couldn't break me, now it's all mine
Surrounded by my angels and we all shine
Holy, holy, holy,  holy key

[Outro: Betty Wright]
Holy, Holy key, holy

[Intro: Future]
It ain't nothin' for me to ball on you
It ain't nothin' for me to spoil you
If I adore you, I'ma give you that theory
I wanna be with you, I wanna be with you
I wanna be with you, I wanna be with you
I wanna be with you, I wanna be with you
I wanna be with you, I wanna be with you

[Verse 1: Nicki Minaj]
I wanna be where the commas will be
But I need a hood nigga with the llama degree
Get the limited edition, Audemars, it could be
In a pivotal position, gotta pardon the fee
Cause he bought a couple bags and he sent a couple whips
And he took a couple trips, then its dinner and a Myx
And he's never with no other chick, fronting like he's slick
Cause it's levels to this shit, and she could never be Nic
Niggas be fallin' in love with this pussy
Mean stew chicken, and bake him a couple of cookies
Dick on veteran, ain't fucking with rookies
Saw the High School video now he wanna play hookie
Baddest bitch, I'm the catalyst
Ain't never been done, bitch I added this
Nah, I ain't gotta shoot, I got mad assists
'Bout to put a couple pieces on the mannequin
Got a big billboard out in Madison
At the Trump, and you bitches at the Radisson
Got the .22 on me, and it's thin
Shoot movies, Jennifer Aniston

[Pre-Chorus: Nicki Minaj]
You decide you'll be mine you can come inside
You the type that can make me prioritize
Hittin' my phone, it's alright
Hittin' my phone, it's alright
You reply, what's your sign? You're a Gemini
You deny that you're shy, maybe we should slide?
I wanna be with you
I wanna be with you, baby

[Chorus: Future]
Ballin' on you too easy, splurgin' on you too easy
Buyin' purses too easy, payin' bills too easy
I wanna be with you, I wanna be with you
I wanna be with you, I wanna be with you
I wanna be with you, I wanna be with you
I wanna be with you, I wanna be with you
Ballin' on you too easy, splurgin' on you too easy
Buyin' cars too easy, poppin' bottles too easy
I wanna be with you, I wanna be with you
Everything you do is brand new

[Verse 2: Rick Ross]
Make that bad bitch my shorty, hit the club, throw forty
My hat bent like 'Uhh!', my chain drip like water
Car paint like tar, I'ma sex her harder
Bitch let go my hand gave you the keys as soon as I bought it
Voom, voom, oh yeah, big bank, I'm too real
My money right in them boys you with be dead broke, two years
Checked it, look her, you ain't even know, big deal
On site, act right, I shop hard, pack light
That ho chick gets you no play, all I talk is cocaine
White tee and these rope chains, blow the roof back - Kurt Cobain
Phantom cost like four dollar, flo' seats, hoes holla
Underground with this pimp shit so smoke one for Port Arthur

[Chorus: Future]
Ballin' on you too easy, splurgin' on you too easy
Buyin' purses too easy, payin' bills too easy
I wanna be with you, I wanna be with you
I wanna be with you, I wanna be with you
I wanna be with you, I wanna be with you
I wanna be with you, I wanna be with you
Ballin' on you too easy, splurgin' on you too easy
Buyin' cars too easy, poppin' bottles too easy
I wanna be with you, I wanna be with you
Everything you do is brand new

[Verse 1: Meek Mill]
Shit ain't been the same since I came through in that hot shit
They gon' talk about you 'til you ain't got shit
Still gon' talk about you when you got shit
All eyes on Meek, I'm on my Pac shit
Y'all rap niggas on some pop shit
I've been duckin' paparazzi with a pop bitch
Glock .30 in the cockpit
Sippin' dirty, conversatin' with the pilot
Nigga, you ain't seen it, I've been fuckin' up arenas
I'm with double M, the genius
We the motherfuckin' meanest
And the cleanest in a long time
You pussy niggas hatin' on me picked the wrong time
Long line for a limp mink draggin', new bandwagon
Blood drippin' on me lookin' like a nigga stabbed him
I be on the money, bakin' soda in the cabinet
Pyrex, tryna whip a Rollie, makin' magic
Laughin' at you fuck niggas gettin' madder
If I feel threatened, I'ma go and get a ladder
And climb up your chest, nigga
Motherfuck your vest, nigga
Motherfuck your couch, I'm with Khaled, the best, nigga

[Chorus: French Montana]

[Verse 2: Rick Ross]
Bullet in the head, they wanna see my shirt red
Live by the code, it's the only way to play it
Benz or the Rolls, Mulsanne overrated
Half these niggas told, cut a deal, they'd take it
Promise to never fold and the bonds still sacred
Had to shake a couple niggas, everybody won't make it
God is the greatest as I'm prayin' in the latest
X600 as I swerve, Little Haiti
Ou paka bat m'wen, sak pase!
I'm bustin' out the sunroof, nigga, 'andal'!
My money always comin', no, I'm never on pause
They bring it straight to your door if you a mothafuckin' boss
Let's ride

Hol' up, you ain't got love for me, my nigga?
Ever meet another nigga like me, my nigga?
Are you sure? A nigga flip this shit like Jarl Borg
A nigga did this shit, this hardcore
If you say it, guess it's true though, kudos, I mean but who knows?
Salute to all the real niggas out there findin' the loopholes
Fuck all these fuck niggas, hate when niggas come up, igh!
Hopped off the plane, hit the helicopter (igh!)
Tell these crabs in the barrel we eatin' hella lobster (igh!)
Got hella options, like a college team
Hit these bootleg niggas with the Heisman
Fuck the NCAA, nigga!
Let a young nigga get paid, nigga!
Niggas talkin' down on the crown
Watch them niggas you 'round got you wound
Haters wanna ball, let me tighten up my draw string
Wrong sport, boy, you know you soft as a lacrosse team
RRRAAAAHHH!

Okay, phone off the hook, yeah, that bitch won't stop blinkin'

You've been drinkin' and drinkin', you're drinkin' for fun
And you drink for a reason
Yeah, leave your boyfriend and call me when you're leavin'
Callin' shots, refereein', no drama
Pussy so wet, I'ma need Dramamine and mattress Aquafining
Boy, I light the block up, young Billie Jeaning
I'm dodgin' the leeches, I'm signin' agreements
I'm signin' new artists, I sell out arenas
Swimmin' with the dolphins on the Dan Marino
Wine mixin', this shit like the Catalina
B-I-G, minus Puff and Lil Cease
I'm on my grind, 3 AM text like I need ya
Dream about the pussy, fuck it, I'm a dreamer
Hold me down but don't hold me back like I need you to, damn
I wrote myself a million dollar check in fifth grade
I put it on the wall and promised it'd be this way
She fuck me like she want the rent paid
Like she want that Oscar De La Renta
I slow it down like it's her favorite ballad
Then go back up at it like I hadn't had it
Straight up

I see these bitches in Supperclub
Niggas got me throwin' bottles up
Bottles with all of my homies
I'm feelin' generous, throwin' my money
She said she wanted the molly love
I gave her the dick but I'm not in love
I call out, "Bingo!" the minute I'm bonin'
Soon as I'm done, kick her out in the mornin'
Got Xans when I turn up, it's a party, bust it open
Pop that pussy in a circle, go retarded, pop it for me
She got that booty galore, grippin' it, backin' me up
You wanna fuck with a thug
Now I see all these bitches got ass and they throwin'
Damn, it's just a matter of time 'fore I'm gone
Drinkin' Ciroc and I know that she got it for free
I hit up Diddy, he told me he did it
He said that the liquor just bring out the freaks
Them bitches lit, droppin' that ass to a split
Talkin' 'bout me, I'm the shit
I just get down for the money, the bitches, and cars
And my niggas, they whippin' the bricks, huh

Why, oh why? You stay, you stay
And cry every night, you stay, you stay
I don't know why, oh why, you stay, you stay, oh
I think you too loyal, you stay, you stay

[Verse 1: Meek Mill]
Uh, I don't know how you do it, but you did it, I'll admit it
And who am I to be a critic and tell you different?
You know I never speak on that nigga, it's not my business
But I could tell you that his level's no competition
And I'm optimistic that I'm 'bout to hit it
And um, I can tell you've been crying in Honda Civics
Because I caught you slipping, left you no choice
You ever cry again, it's gon' be in a Rolls Royce
I wipe your face with them new hundreds to make your tears dry
Hitting it on a jet, this ain't no red eye
Got you chasing dreams, and it ain't even bedtime
And don't you dare bring up your ex 'cause he a dead guy
I wonder

[Chorus: Jeremih]
Why, oh why? (Oh why?)
Do you ride, do you stick by his side
If he makes you cry every night?
Girl, I see the pain in your eyes
I don't know why, oh why, you stay, you stay, oh
You stay, you stay
You stay, tell me why you

[Verse 2: Jeremih & DJ Khaled]
I think you're too loyal
I think you do too much for someone who don't do shit for you, girl
And that's real
That ain't the way love supposed to feel
But you say he's the one for you
Then complain how he don't show you
But you ain't gotta take that
Baby, you can't take that
Hit the gym and get your shape back, oh
Fuck that nigga
Don't understand why you still trust that nigga (Work)
With your mind and your heart and your soul (Let's go)
For your goals, in control, you let it go (Work)
I just want to see you happy
I just want to see you laughing
I just want to see you smiling
I can tell you need somebody who really about you
Who gon' see about you
'Cause it's been a while, so baby

[Chorus: Jeremih]
Why, oh why? (Oh why?)
Do you ride, do you stick by his side
If he makes you cry every night?
Girl, I see the pain in your eyes
I don't know why, oh why, you stay, you stay, oh
You stay, you stay
I think you too loyal

[Verse 3: Lil Baby & J Balvin]
You give him chance after chance
'Cause you say maybe one day he'll grow up and be a man
And lately you been pouring out your heart on the 'Gram
But you been playing your part from the start, I understand
I put carats on your hand
But see I'm one of them bad guys
And I can't guarantee the world
But I promise you'll be better than last time
As long as you're loyal
You got a plan, I'll do more than spoil
I'll be there to support you
Drop top in the wintertime, whatever just to see you smile
Private jet from time to time, by the ocean, I'll drive you wild
Whatever your decision, I'm with it, no asking why
I catch you slipping at all, you gon' be mine (J Balvin, men; 'wuh!)

[Outro: J Balvin, Jeremih, & DJ Khaled]
Ma', la verdad es un orgullo tenerte a mi lado

And every time I step up in the building
Everybody hands go up
And they stay there (There), and they say yeah (Yeah)
And they stay there, up, down, up, down, up, down
'Cause all I do is win (Win), win (Win), win
And if you going in put your hands in the air, make 'em stay there

[Verse 1: Ludacris]
Yeah, listen, Luda!
Ludacris goin' in on the verse
'Cause I never been defeated and I won't stop now (Woah)
Keep your hands up, get 'em in the sky
For the homies that didn't make it and my folks locked down (Woah)
I never went nowhere (No), but they sayin' "Luda's back" (Yeah)
Blame it on that conjure (Ha), the hood call it Luda 'gnac (Yah)
And I'm on this foolish track, so I spit my foolish flow (Flow)
My hands go up and down (Down), like strippers' booties go (Whoo)
My verses still be servin' (Yup), tight like a million virgins (Yup)
Last time on the Khaled remix, now I'm on the original version (Yah)
Can't never count me out (No), y'all better count me in (Yo)
Got twenty bank accounts, accountants count me in (Whoo)
Make millions every year (Yeah) the South's champion (Yeah)
'Cause all I do, all I, all I, all I, all I do is

[Chorus: T-Pain, Ludacris & Rick Ross]
All I do is win, win (Ay), win no matter what (Whoo)
Got money on my mind, I can never get enough ('Nough)
And every time I step up in the building
Everybody hands go up
And they stay there (There), and they say yeah (Yeah)
And they stay there, up, down, up, down, up, down
'Cause all I do is win (Win), win (Win), win (Who?)
And if you going in (Boss) put your hands in the air (Boss), make 'em stay there

[Verse 2: Rick Ross & DJ Khaled]
Swervin' in my lo-lo
Head on the swivel, you know serving me's a no-no
Clean as a whistle as I pull out in my Rolls Royce
Yellow bone passenger, they see it they say, "Oh boy"
Tell Khaled back it up, my niggas call me loco
Down for armed trafficking, don't make me pull that fo'-fo'
Ask you what you laughing at (What?), represent that mud life (Mud life)
Dirty money bitch you better get yo' mud right (Mud right)
We come together holdin' hands and holla "Thug life" ("Thug Life")
We all strapped in all black, it's like fuck life (Fuck life) (All we do is win)
You riding to what (What) 'cause we riding tonight (Tonight)
Now she riding with me 'cause you wasn't riding her right
Ross!

[Chorus: T-Pain]
All I do is win, win, win no matter what (What)
Got money on my mind, I can never get enough ('Nough)
And every time I step up in the building
Everybody hands go up
And they stay there (There), and they say yeah (Yeah)
And they stay there, up, down, up, down, up, down
'Cause all I do is win (Win), win (Win), win
And if you going in put your hands in the air, make 'em stay there

[Verse 3: Snoop Dogg]
Heat in the kitchen, pot on the stove
Water gettin' boiled, dope being sold
Snoopy in the hoopty, system overload
I been running this rap game since I was 20 years old
I hung with the worst of 'em, bust 'til I burst 'em up
Floss 'em up, toss 'em up, Hardaway, cross 'em up
Pardon me, I'm bossing up, pressure up, bless you bruh
Don't mess with us, we like the U in the 80's
Back to back, set a trap, hit the lick, hit it back
Hit the trick, jump the track, bitch I want my money back
Time and time again while I'm sipping on this gin
Al Davis said it best, "Just win baby, win"

[Chorus: T-Pain]
All I do is win, win, win no matter what (What)
Got money on my mind, I can never get enough ('Nough)
And every time I step up in the building
Everybody hands go up
And they stay there (There), and they say yeah (Yeah)
And they stay there, up, down, up, down, up, down
'Cause all I do is win (Win), win (Win), win
And if you going in put your hands in the air, make 'em stay there

[Intro: DJ Khaled]
Classic shit, timeless, forever, iconic
DJ Khaled!

[Verse 1: Nas]
A divine leader, shine brighter, bonita mami meeter
Line sniffer, never, poetic rhyme writer, chiefer
Ebony empress getter
Celebrity Apprentice a devil show, big up to Africa, Mexico
Hennessy, margarita, venison eater
So dear, spread 'em here, don't be actin' innocent either
Dome me, relax me, it's only to the nasty
I'm just a phony assassin, a lot of niggas owe me, I'ma tax 'em
A lot of sisters hold me to somethin' holy and Catholic
'Cause the rosary and gold flashy
Just an attachment and accessory to my dress code
Now everywhere all I see is Pablo, Esco
Last time I checked I was still breathin', my neck was still freezin'
Now everybody got an Escobar Season
To every baby on the album cover existin'
This trend I was settin', it came to fruition
I'm assistin' to push the culture forward
To all my ghost supporters, go support us
Like a local black-owned grocery store
'Cause in the hood shit ain't passed down through blood
It's a dub on that, we get government aid
Spend it at they stores, puttin' they kids through college
We need balance so we can lease and own deeds in our projects
So I'm askin' Gs to go in their pockets
The racial economic inequality, let's try to solve it

[Chorus: Nas]
My signature fade with the Bevel blade, that's a major key
I told her she smart and loyal, I like that, that's a major key
Start a label, run it, sign yourself, that's a major key
What Tony had on the table, it's like us, we a major key

[Verse 2: Nas]
Still underestimated, every mistake a lesson
Mercury retrograde, so if that planet spin backwards
Up in the heavens maybe
It's effectin' back on niggas who don't be reppin' lately
I'm playin' chess with babies, niggas is nursery
Niggas impersonatin', rehearsin' me
Nothin' like me, I'm the first of me and that's quite certainly
So official, come get this issue, some women crazy
I like a woman to show me wisdom
These hoes easily convinced to pop their pussy
With a loaded pistol; y'all ain't meant to be played
Says the brother with the signature fade
Still paid, stackin', new stash
Went from hangin' with shooters and clappers
To computer hackers, check the fashion in Monaco
Gettin' ocean mist on my HSTRY hats
Khaled called me when I was in album mode
So I put it on hold for the Major Key
My album done, niggas, wait and see

[Interlude: DJ Khaled]
Classic shit, timeless, forever, iconic

[Chorus: Nas]
My signature fade with the Bevel blade, that's a major key
I told her she smart and loyal, I like that, that's a major key
Start a label, run it, sign yourself, that's a major key
What Tony had on the table, it's like us, we a major key

Your body's shakin', girl, I feel that
It's mine forever, we grind together
And when you put them slugs in, we even shine together
And I love that and I think she knows that
Whenever she around it, gotta go down (Go down)

But nobody handcuffin', baby, no doubt (Ooh, woah)
'Cause we both know what it was, she loves

[Intro: DJ Khaled]
This shit's special
DJ Khaled!

[Verse 1: Scarface]
And if I cry two tears for her
That will be the most that I would give to her
She left me stranded in my nightmares
Taking pictures of my memories she right there
Twisting on the blade in my heart, deep
Always on my mind so I can't sleep
She used to tell me she was all mine
Now the only way I see the broad is online
I'm doing drugs trying to feel you
I'm killing me trying to kill you
I built my whole life around ya
I thought I found it all when I found her
Shopping sprees on whatever coast
How'd you really feel, I may never know
And as I ride through these streets
With my hand on my heat, eyes red from the sweets, I
Realize some things never change
Once in love and it's gone you don't look at it the same, nigga
Fuck love cause she don't live here
I'm soaked in blood but I'm still here
Hip Hop heartbreaks
Straight-laced, deep bass, 808s plus the mixtapes
Got a nigga feeling like I up and left ya
Get away now you all in the lectures
Being studied by the college's professors
Now I regret the day I met ya
(Bitch) I'll be the first one to say it
She ain't the one you want to play with
I fucked Hip Hop

[Verse 2: Nas]
And if I cry two tears for her
That would be the most that I can give to her
I am Joseph, Darryl, Jason, Dr. Dre, O'Shea
And a host of those who passed away
Today I'm Drake, I'm Wayne, 2 Chainz
You say you want to rap, to this bitch you must commit
Then you're a slave to your grave, you won't get out, you cannot quit
She menstruates weekly, her vibe covers keep you warm
But the source to her heart is love, word up, right on
You know how girls are, she love when you licking on her world star
Kissing on her belly, trick on her at Onyx
Confused fans think that she illuminates demonic
But she's the object of my affections, God's essence, God bless her
She bought me Bentleys, Breitlings, made some friends resent me
For writing about my life, they thought I should have stayed quiet
She took me to places I would have never saw without her
And she took me from my girl powder
I doubt I'll ever be the same, hallowed be thy name
Give me strength so I don't do this dame like Orenthal James
Brad warned me while driving this auburn Ferrari
Never follow in her games, I fuck around and I'll be sorry
But I tried her used to ride her, for dollars not the fame
She slowed me down and had me guzzling on cups of lean
She's a middle-aged cougar, showing young'uns the dream
Noticed she wasn't breathing for a second then I screamed
"She's dead!" and everybody took it out on Nasty
I was just looking out for my music family
Wasn't trying to claim her to myself, she's yours
You can have her she's a motherfucking whore
I fuck Hip Hop

[Scratch Outro 1: DJ Premier]
And if I cry two tears for her, that would be the most that I would I give to her
She ain't the one you wanna play with
You say you wanna rap, to this bitch you must commit
I fuck hip hop
And if I cry two tears for her, that will be the most I can give to her
She ain't the one you wanna play with
(I fuck hip hop)
And you all know how the story go

[Outro 2: DJ Khaled]
This shit's special

[Refrain: EARTHGANG]
Can't call it, can't call it
I never came from deep pockets
Why can't I make a deposit?
Can't call it, uh, can't call it
Yeah, can't call it, I can't call it
I never came from deep pockets
Why can't I make a deposit?
Can't call it, yeah, I can't call it

[Chorus: J. Cole]
Oh, I had so many days of crying
Oh, I had so many days of pain
Have you ever been as sad as I am?
Lord, I ask if anything would change?
I can see the future that we're heading
I would say it's better not to tell
If it's anything like this in Heaven
Maybe I'd be better off in hell
(Better off in hell)

[Verse: J. Cole]
Tables do turn and labels do burn
The second they ask you to sell your soul
Don't you do it, don't you fold, say "Fuck that shit" and be bold
Cause all them stories you told on records worth more than gold
And if you never go gold again, at least you would know
The end of your road was chose, by you and not companies
Who control our remote control, and hide the truth on my no
But don't mind me, I'm just high again
Smokin' weed to get by again
No, actually I'm lyin' 'cause smokin' ain't got me smilin'
And rhyming like I rhyme way back when I would play the violin
Thought that shit wasn't cool
Momma sorry, I just stopped tryin' it
Paid for your house in hopes, there'd be no more reason for cryin'
That shows you how stupid I am 'cause niggas is out here dying
From police that flash the siren and pull up and just start firin'
Niggas murkin' each other in murky water, I try and swim
How the fuck do I look when I brag to you 'bout some diamond?
Said all that I could say now I play with thoughts of retirement

[Chorus: J. Cole]
Oh, I had so many days of crying
Oh, I had so many days of pain
Have you ever been as sad as I am?
Lord, I ask if anything would change?
I can see the future that we're heading
I would say it's better not to tell
If it's anything like this in Heaven
Maybe I'd be better off in hell
(Better off in hell)

[Refrain: EARTHGANG]
Can't call it, can't call it
I never came from deep pockets
Why can't I make a deposit?
Can't call it, uh, can't call it
Yeah, can't call it, I can't call it
I never came from deep pockets
Why can't I make a deposit?
Can't call it, yeah, I can't call it

I talk gray, I don't keep it white and black

Sometimes, other times I'd love to have you back
Can't think of a night that we ain't turn up to the max
To the max, no
Like the album just went platinum, yeah

Now all of a sudden, people say we cousins

Five, six, hide your bitch
(Ayo Yeezy, pop your shit!)

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
They said "thou shall not be ill, thou shall not feel
Thou should not be trill, not be drill, not be real"
Niggas selling packs, niggas flipping pills
They got heroin and cracks, man these niggas hot for real
Every year gon' be our year, every year gon' be my year
These niggas really is out here, these niggas really is out here
The block is at war, post traumatic stress
Ran up outta pills, rob that CVS
Niggas getting bust over In God We Trust
We believe in God, but do God believe in us?
If we believe enough, will we ever get to know him?
That lean got us dozing, we forget that we the chosen

[Pre-Chorus: Kanye West]
I've been poppin' shit for too long

Hunh! My money on a another level
In the streets out here I'm hotter than the fucking devil
I wonder how I got a hundred in my fucking bezel
G5, make it rain, I can change the weather
We fly, them niggas lame, where your fucking cheddar?
Aim at your brain, AK be the fucking letters
Fuck niggas fall in alphabetical order
Frank Lucas fur, the cap run more than a quarter
I'm at the fight, ringside, right next to promoters
All my niggas still hustle, consider 'em roguish
I remember catching buses just bought me a Lotus
All your codes get decoded, know the niggas you quoting
Hunh, my corner will scorch ya, somehow my flow is the coldest
Money, power, respect, the only things truly important
Family first, Khaled we gotta stay focused
God Forgives and I Don't, pussy niggas on notice

[Chorus: Kanye West]
I wish you would nigga, I wish you would nigga
I wish you would nigga, I wish you would nigga
Ay! I guess it's how I came up

But you gon' chill nigga, just for your kids nigga
Cause now there's kids doing grown man biz nigga
You just got home nigga, you tryna live nigga
You don't wanna do another 5 years nigga
The boss is testing yo ass, the feds'll question yo ass
They be drug testin' yo ass and then they pray you don't pass
And then you look in the sky, you got some questions to ask
With no response make you wanna grab the tech and the mac

But don't you know that the devil is a liar? (Yeah, I know)
They'd rather see me down, put my soul in the fire
But we keep goin' higher, higher

[Verse 1: Nipsey Hussle]
Look, look
My granny 88, she had my uncle and then
A miscarriage back-to-back every year for like ten
Pregnant with my moms, doctor told her it was slim
Was bed rode for nine months, but gave birth in the end
Pops turned 60, he proud what we done
In one generation, he came from Africa young
He said he met my moms at the Century Club
Los Angeles love kinda of like Hussle and Boog
Mani turned ten, Kross turned two
Startin' to see this life shit from a bird's view
We the ones that made millions off the curb, fool
In this rap shit ten, never made nerd moves

[Chorus: John Legend]
Oh, you keep taking me higher and higher (Yeah)
(Hussle, Khaled)
But don't you know that the devil is a liar? (Yeah, I know)

But we keep goin' higher, higher (Woah, woah)

[Verse 2: Nipsey Hussle & John Legend]
Emptied out the clip, it was broad day
Fuck niggas always gotta learn the hard way
We gon' tape it off if we ball play
Put a half a moon crescent on your bald fade
Police hit the lights, that's a car chase
Lookin' back at my life make my heart race
Dance with the devil and test our faith
I was thinkin' chess moves but it was God's grace
Crooked ass whoever 'til we all straight
With no shame, I peeped game and it's all fake
South Central state of mind, high crime rate (Yeah)
Homicide, hate, gang banging'll get you all day (Yeah, yeah)
And look at my fate

[Chorus: John Legend & Nipsey Hussle]
Oh, you keep taking me higher and higher (Yeah)
(Told Khaled bounce the four 'til the bar break)
But don't you know that the devil is a liar? (I know)
They'd rather see me down, put my soul in the fire

[Verse 1: SZA & DJ Khaled]
Back against the wall, middle fingers in the air
Busting through the crowd, they gon' feel me now
Straight shooter from the hip, yeah, we heavy in here
Tell me get 'em, then I got 'em, yea (Get 'em)
99 problems, but you ain't one
Been so high lately, I don't care who's goin' down
You could see it in my eyes, he been hitting it right
Got me wishing that he wasn't, oh no
And I need it all night
Will love show me what it feels like?
Fuck that, I let you pull up on me broad day light
Shots over here, fuck the other side
We don't gotta lay low, we grown
A field trip and I don't need no chaperone
I'm tryna get ghost
Oh, oh (Another one)

[Chorus: SZA]
It's just us against the world
In this life of sin
Ain't nobody gonna take us out
It's always us, never them
It's just us against the world
When the smoke clears
All we got is all we got
It's always us, never them

[Verse 2: SZA & DJ Khaled]
It's lovely at the top, private destination
Sippin' on the rocks, only way with us
This kinda love dangerous when there's nothing else to lose
So don't make me wild out (Let's ride)
Got 99 problems, what's one more?
50 feet get you touched at your front door
Livin' fast and we spending slow
Side eyes let me know that we visible
And I need it right now (Yeah)
Ten toes down, show me what it's all about
Thuggin', we only duckin' when the boys come out
It's us over them, fuck the other side
We gonna turn the lights off, we hard
What we doin', don't nobody gotta know
I ain't tryna get ghost, oh yes
Oh, oh

[Chorus: SZA]
It's just us against the world
In this life of sin
Ain't nobody gonna take us out
It's always us, never them
It's just us against the world
When the smoke clears
All we got is all we got
It's always us, never them

[Bridge: DJ Khaled & SZA]
This how an angel sounds (No, no, do-do)
It's just, uh, it's just us, it's just us
It's just us
It's always us, it's always us
It's only us
It's just us, it's just us, it's just us
It's always, it's always us, it's always us

[Chorus: SZA]
It's just us against the world
In this life of sin (Yeah)
Ain't nobody gonna take us out
It's always us, never them (Yeah, yeah)
It's just us against the world
When the smoke clears
All we got is all we got
It's always us, never them

[Outro: SZA & DJ Khaled]
You're all that I need, ooh, yeah

[Intro: DJ Khaled & Anthony Hamilton]
Keep your circle tight
Trust no one, nobody (nobody, nobody, no no no)
DJ Khaled!

[Verse 1: Scarface]
Gotta be careful who you trusting
Be aware of your surroundings when you hustling
Them niggas smiling at you ain't your friends, dawg
All the real ones are dead or in the pen y'all
You fuck with dude, he your day one
Almost had it all then the day comes
When they walking through your house with the strap out
Pointing at your head, got the bread then you black out (yeah)
Bright lights down the hallways
Left his best friend for dead for the small wage (ay)
They say that every dog's got a day coming
It's like he seen a ghost but he ain't say nothing
Eyes wide shut like you looking at me
Window pane to the soul say they niggas happy
But the pictures say them words we ain't trying to stomach
The homie didn't keep it one hundred
The cops doing roundups, say they got a suspect
Finally got a name now, I'm stunned thinkin fuck that (fuck, that)
For the money, niggas murder what they close to (get this nigga)
Entire families, these motherfuckers ghost you
Smoke you, was it worth what the life was?
Just prepare for the payback cause it strikes cuz
Was it worth what that life was?
Prepare for the payback when it strikes cuz

[Bridge: John Legend]
Cause when you need it the most
Ain't no one ever around
Cold world, cold world

[Verse 2: Jadakiss]
Yo, the pain's unbearable, remains unawareable
He fuck around, jump off a building if you dare him to
The greats they done already killed him, who you compare him to
To really figure out what he said will take a year or two
Family over everything, skills over politics
He don't need the accolades as long as you acknowledge it
Just playing the hand you was dealt, no aces
Betrayal is worse than death in most cases
The world is filled with hypocrites, that's so racist
Multiple shots to the face, no chasers
Mad cause you blew up quick and you excited
Your man that you grew up with get you indicted
This was your nigga, yo, for him you let the trigger go
Found out at the trial they got audio and video
Shit don't always happen how you plan it
Get jammed up and really find out who your fam is
You could feel the picture, you don't need to see the canvas
That nigga Jay'll Hawk you, he don't even play for Kansas
You know when it's someone you love the hurt's pure
You front tryna hold it in, it hurts more
He was right there back-to-back with me, my first war
Even had a crack spot together, the first floor
Used to buzz em in then meet him right by the first door
That was 'prolly a year before I went on my first tour
Friendship was worth more than a couple of ounces
You was 'sposed to be with me arguing with the bouncers
Instead you ended up somewhere far in the mountains
Talking 'about what we was doing, what we was counting
Nothing but old pictures of old sixes
Old BM's with the kits, old Schnitzer's
Two sides, both wishes
Karma is the sister of life, they both bitches

[Bridge: Anthony Hamilton]
See there's a story in my life
There's a story in my pain
There's a story in my tears, oh-oh ohh
There's a story in me

[Verse 3: Meek Mill]
Yeah, for life
Lord forgive me for my sins, I was chasin' ends
And I'm into makin' money, I ain't into making friends
Cause these niggas rattin', I ain't finna take a chance
Homie said he 'bout that action, they grab him, he take the stand
Damn, say loyalty make a man
Got a homie and he told, I don't even shake his hand
I don't even crack a smile, knew him since a child
Man this game so foul but niggas made vows
To a code I never break, ridin' in the heavyweight
Thirty-six O's in a bird, call it featherweight
Never on time, when I show up I be ready late
Niggas got fat while we starved, they already ate
And I'm trying to get full, masks on, clip full
If he got the money, we attack him like a pit bull
We sellin' soft, we sellin' hard like it's a brick store
On my dick, nigga, thought that's what your bitch for
Hah!

[Bridge: Akon]
My pain ain't never been told (ain't never been told)
All the success that I'm suffering from
Came from this knowledge I sold (this knowledge I know)
My family fucks with me
And fought the enemy that stood in my way (my way)
That's why I don't trust nobody
And I doubt you'll ever see that day

[Chorus: Akon]
'Fore I surrender to you (surrender)
Surrender to you (surrender)
Surrender to you (surrender to you, which I will never do)

[Bridge: John Legend & Anthony Hamilton]
Cause when you need it the most
Ain't no one ever around (nobody's around)
Cold world (cold world) cold world (mmm, yes it is, yeah)
And the ones that you keep close
Are the ones that'll take you down (always take you down)
Cold world (cooooold) a cold cold world

[Chorus: Akon]
'Fore I surrender to you (surrender)
Surrender to you (surrender)
Surrender to you (surrender to you)
Fore I surrender to you (surrender)
Surrender to you (surrender)
Surrender to you (surrender to you, which I will never do)

[Breakdown: Akon & Anthony Hamilton]
Ohh-ohhh ohhh-whooooa
Ohh-ohhhh (ohh-ohhhh) ohh-ohhhhh

[Outro: Anthony Hamilton, Akon & John Legend]
See there's a story in my life (hey) (surrender)
There's a story in my pain (hey) (surrender)
There's a story in my tears, oh-oh ohh (surrender)
There's a story in me
I won't surrender, I won't surrender, ohh no no no

[Intro: Akon & DJ Khaled]

Konvict Music (We The Best!)

Yeah (We takin' over, listen!)

[Verse 1: T.I.]
Started in Atlanta, then I spread out with it
South Carolina, Alabama, Mississippi
On to North Carolina, Philadelphia, and Virginia
From down in Miami where it warm in the winter
On up to Minnesota where it storm in the winter
Jacksonville, Tallahassee, Memphis, Tenn; holla at me
Be in H-Town, Southside, Cloverland, daddy
I'm the man out in Dallas, better ask Khaled
Kept me out in Cali with my eyes open barely
Blowin' and spinnin', goin' down Bennett
Drop 6-4, 3-wheel, then switch it
Red light stop, make it drop for the bitches
Got a Glock 4/5th, blow your head off with it
Anything you hear that I said, I meant it
King got the crown, then sped off with it
Say you need bricks, I said "I'll get it"

[Pre-Chorus: Akon]
If you want to, we can supply you (Supply you)
Got enough work to feed the whole town
They won't shoot you unless you try to (Try to)
Come around and try to stomp on our ground

[Chorus: Akon & DJ Khaled]
'Cause we takin' over (One city at a time)
Said we takin' over (One city at a time)
Said we takin' over (One city at a time)
Said we takin' over (One city at a time)
Oh oh (Listen!)

[Verse 2: Rick Ross]
Boss, it's what I does
I get money er'ryday, er'ryday I does
That Benz is how I ride
Black flag on the left, two hoes and ride
You better move, AK all day
Get shot up like Shyne, that's on my neck
I'm big like Diddy; damn it, I'm with it
Khaled, we did it, Biggie of my city
Please no fitted, fuck it, I'm too pretty
I'd rather get brain, stupid, I'm silly
Money that come runnin' like water
Mami so hot, damn it, she gorgeous
Miami on fire, you better be cautious
Might get shot on the porch of your fortress
Yeah, they see it but no one reports it
I run this, Rick Ross, boss shit

[Chorus: Akon & DJ Khaled]
'Cause we takin' over (One city at a time)
Said we takin' over (One city at a time)
Said we takin' over (One city at a time)
Said we takin' over (One city at a time)
Oh oh (Listen!)

[Verse 3: Fat Joe]
Blat, when you see Crack, better duck
Like the MAC gotta EZ pass, nigga what?
Shit, I don't give a fuck, I run these streets
Y'all talk that shit, I walk that beef
I'ma tell you like a G told me
They'll come back quick if a nigga OD
Cash rule everything around me
I'm YSL, Versace
You could see me in that Porsche GT
Comin' down Sunset, sittin' on Ds
Feelin' like Pac: all eyes on me
Fresh bandana and I'm blowin' mad trees
Nigga please, I spit crack, every verse a ki
Some say "Khaled," some say "Khaleed"
Twelve years down and I'm finally free

[Pre-Chorus: Akon]
If you want to, we can supply you (Supply you)
Got enough work to feed the whole town
They won't shoot you unless you try to (Try to)
Come around and try to stomp on our ground

[Chorus: Akon & DJ Khaled]
'Cause we takin' over (One city at a time)
Said we takin' over (One city at a time)
Said we takin' over (One city at a time)
Said we takin' over (One city at a time)
Oh oh (Listen!)

[Verse 4: Birdman]
Birdman daddy, I'm number one
Nigga came at me wrong, so we got him done
Fuckin' with the fam, I'ma give him some
Spent that corner, he didn't run
Sunday had a whole church singin' a song
Why'd they have to send my baby home?
Fuckin' with some niggas, that paper long
Been a G in the game, now my son on the throne

[Verse 5: Lil Wayne]
Ah, I am the beast
Feed me rappers or feed me beats
I'm untamed, I need a leash
I'm insane, I need a shrink
I love brain, I need a leech
Why complain on Easy Street?
I don't even talk, I let the Visa speak
And I like my Sprite Easter-pink
And my wrist-wear Chpard but the M'ller's cooler
I have more jewels than your jeweler
Touch and I will bust your medulla
That's a bullet-hole, it is not a tumor
Red light, read light, stop your rumors
I stay on track like a box of Pumas
Now just r-r-rock with Junior
I am the Little Big Kahuna, y'dig?

[Outro: Akon]
'Cause we takin' over (One city at a time)

DJ Khaled

[Verse 1: J Cole]
And you know it don't stop, grindin' 'round that clock
Masterminding my second album, my first album just dropped
Scored a touchdown on my first down, niggas thought I was gon' flop
See I hustle like my momma but I look just like my pops
And we still duckin' cops, ride around and take shots
Hennessy for my enemies, niggas know I'm takin' they spot
'Cause that score up on the play clock show just how I came from way back
Just like T-I-P told you ' ASAP; but you niggas rappin' like Aesop, Aesop
Get a grip!

[Pre-Chorus 1: J. Cole]
Oh that's your dream car? Nigga that's my old whip
Oh that's your dream girl? Nigga that's my old bitch
Oh that's your new flow? Nigga that's my old shit!
This that new K.R.I.T. shit, that Cole shit, them country niggas

[Chorus: J Cole]
One for the money, two for the show
Three for them hoes saying anything goes
They say they ready for whatever!
They say they ready for whatever
I been around the world, twice to be exact
Six bad bitches and they lapped up in the back
They say they ready for whatever!
They say they ready for whatever

[Verse 2: Big K.R.I.T.]
Young Krizzle
Shawty look what we got, my bass beat and it knock
Got the old school in my old school was to post up on yo block
Yo broad chose like she was s'posed to and you up in arms 'cause she bopped
Cole I hate to say it but I got to say that I wish that they would just stop
So fuck these haters, fuck these hoes that ain't slammin' doors on they drop
Y'all niggas too young to remember how to the south used to be but I'm not
So when it come to snappin', Cadillacs, SpottieOttieDopaliscious, y'all pop
You thought Krit Wuz Here and R4 were the shit? Bitch, wait 'til my album drop

[Pre-Chorus 2: Big K.R.I.T.]
Say that's yo new car? Nigga that's my old slab
Say that's yo new bitch? Nigga that's my old stab
Oh that's yo new flow? That shit sound so trash

[Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar]
Hol' up...but don't forget about Compton, nigga!
One for the money, two for the show
Three for No Limit and the rest for Death Row
That means I been 'bout it 'bout it and this is the realest shit I ever wrote
And if anyone ever doubt it then they are the loudest of liars I know
I only desire to blow, she only desire to blow
And I hope that my dick is a whistling flute, and that's not the instrumental
Now pick up my coat
You let that motherfucker drag like RuPaul, I'll drag your ass to the floor
Bitch, I can admit, I'm a recovered addict, paraphernalia that is
Telling the doctor I'm sick, head doctor I'm needing your lips, yeah
Proper analogy for it, if I can afford it then I won't ignore it, clear
Cop me a palace and Porsche and right when I floor it that's when I switch gears
Living my life on Uranus, uh, keeping one foot in your anus, uh
The other foot all on your neck, repeatedly stomp 'til I break it, uh
Bitch I'm demanding respect, these bitches is telling me take it
DJ Khaled, even if I had callus, holding the torch ain't no challenge
Ain't it?

[Chorus: J Cole]
One for the money, two for the show
Three for them hoes saying anything goes
They say they ready for whatever!
They say they ready for whatever
I been around the world, twice to be exact
Six bad bitches and they lapped up in the back
They say they ready for whatever!
They say they ready for whatever

[Chorus: Big Sean]
Make me give up everything I worked for
You gon' make me give up everything I worked for

Make me give up everything I worked for
You gon' make me give up everything I worked for

You gon' make me give up everything I worked for

[Verse 1: Big Sean]
You, you gon' get this Rollie off the wrist, yeah
You gon' have my phone full of all your pics, yeah yeah
You gon' have me flying in and out of town
You said you've been losing weight and dropping pounds
Damn, I think I'm 'bout to leave the one I'm with
Start a new relationship with you, this is what you do
I had you after twelve but you came right after at two
I could have anything I'd want but I still want you
That's the truth
I'm not really into the sentimentals
Just me and you behind the tinted windows
While you throwing all these innuendos
We just finna fuck up all the incidentals at the SLS
That's LA confidential
Show me everything that you've been through
We only do what we meant to like, woah
This that titties on the glass, pull the curtains shit
This that fuck you in the air, no service dick
This that call his ass right now, say you're deserting him
This that call him while we fucking so he heard the shit

[Chorus: Big Sean]
Make me give up everything I worked for
You gon' make me give up everything I worked for
Sunday, you ain't go to church though

You gon' make me give up everything I worked for

[Verse 2: Gucci Mane]
Money stalking me, its like the money talk to me

I work with dope boys, I keep a fork on me (skrt)
I'm in my drop top
But won't let you get the drop on me (catch up)
I keep the yop on me and trouble seems to follow me
I take my pistol to the mall, my pistol shop with me
That bitch is jockin' me, and young niggas admire me
Yeah, but I'm a product of the streets so they won't hire me

[Verse 3: 2 Chainz]
Can't let you play me off the streets you know I got kids
And more major keys than a locksmith
I could teach you niggas how to rock this
My bed was a pallet on the carpet
My ride was a bus named MARTA
Pillow full of Estee Lauder
Nigga, I'm allergic to a Charger
Nothing but foreign cars in my garage, ah

[Chorus: Big Sean]
Make me give up everything I worked for
You gon' make me give up everything I worked for
Sunday, you ain't go to church though

Sunday, that's what they pray to church for
You gon' make me give up everything I worked for

[Verse 4: Big Sean]
I'm takin' risks, she takin' pills, takin' pics
Day job night job, Jamaican shit
I stick to the basics, not a basic bitch
You deserve a young young legendary
Heartthrob speeding up your respiratory
Treat these others hoes secondary
I couldn't even cheat with my secretary
Faithful to you even when I'm on road
Even if I'm on a different coast
I'mma still make you feel close, mama
I'm addicted to your ass and titties
When you dance the bedroom turn to Magic City
Got my ass throwing hundreds, fifties
Outta thin air, yeah thats magic tricking
I take you to the Caribbean
Make your mind as clear as the water you swimming in
In and out that bitch like we amphibians
I won't change you up next season
For another chick like they did Aunt Vivian
I'mma put you on the businesses
I'mma divy up the dividends
I'mma show you what the fuck commitment is, baby
Make me give up everything I worked for
You gon' make me give
Girl you make me wanna leave the one I'm with
Start a new relationship with you, this feel like d'j' vu

[Chorus: Big Sean]
Make me give up everything I worked for
You gon' make me give up everything I worked for
Sunday, that's what they pray to church for
You gon' make me give up everything I worked for
Make me give up everything I worked for
You gon' make me give up everything I worked for (work, work)
Make me, make me
What I worked for (work, work)
(do it, do it, do it, damn, do it)
You make me wanna
Oh my god
Eh, eh, eh

Maybach Music
Diamonds drippin' on me, she know who the one
Two-seaters every season and I just begun
Aquafina, she drippin' puddles on a sunny day
Multi-million dollar plays and that's a hundred ways
Fuck a fashion, we could match in my Herm's seats
Top down, JFK, I pray he get impeached
Say no names, Supreme underwear and like 80 chains
Hundred for the rich forever perspective, never change
Petty bitches postin' niggas like they was wedding pictures
Evidently, I'm gettin' richer, trickin' seven figures
Ain't no difference when you see me or that's on television
Chasin' a hundred million, baby, my natural ambition

Boy I took my life and bossed it up
I took the risk, coin-tossed it up
I just left work to work some more, I'm still a workaholic
I done sacrificed it all, paid the dues and costs
Life will test us all, let's see if we true or false
I walk up to my fate and stare that shit in the face
Hungry for the competition, bitch, get on my plate
No mercy, no grace, I'm checkin' off my to-do list
There's no room off in the schedule
It's only room for improvement
And I realized all I ever needed was in me, nigga
S on my chest, boy, so shots can't even pinch me, nigga
No substitute for me, but they gon' still tempt me, nigga
God is in me, that's the only one who can end me, nigga
And we seen more blessings than a Baptist Ebenezer
My daddy says: "You got a good girl, she's a keeper."
Boy, I'm a Caesar, I see shit and seize it
Roc-A-Fella chain, but you can still get Ether'd
Yeah, they don't really fuckin' feel me
Man, but when you really run it they try and clip your Achilles'
I'm on track to a billi', I got Khaled fuckin' with me
That mean I got the Holy Key and got the key to the city, lil nigga

Yeah! It's We The Best! It's YMCMB!

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
Talk about it, make 'em talk about it
Life to me is currency, prosperity, I got it
And your life to me is lifeless like it's livin' on life support
I license everything in my wallet
Lightest boy with the biggest heart
Nigga, play yo' part or parallel park yo' ego
Next to me and violence
Next to me is definitely no one, I'm one of one
And I musta won that from anybody who had it
Or, better yet, forgot it
Mack in the back of a 'Lac with a MAC in the back of a 'Lac
With a latch on the back of the trunk
Hit a punk in the back with a pump in the back till he's off balance
And I'm back in the front of the front of the future
When you are mentioning talent
And I'm back in the back of the block
With a cop wanna cop anybody's allowance
Iraq on the block, he watch with a block or whatever
And cut, no cut, mo' guns, mo' guts, fuck boy
You fucked up twice, you fucked considerin' you drownin'
Die in a lake with a date with a catfish, backflip head-first smilin'
Cr'cry in the face of Jesus, we just pray we keep on stylin'
On you bitches, TDE, YMCMB big business, bitch!

[Interlude: Ace Hood]

Don't talk nigga, fuck you pay me, intercept your bitch like Bailey
Okay big money on this side, 100 grand for the whip my bitch drive
Need a new safe money getting too high, dead presidents all in my Levis
Boy I swear this nigga be swagging, and I'm living lavish

Anything I drive I own 'em, bad bitch and that ass ain't normal
Gotta put that pound game on her, beat it up she deep in a coma
I'm super paid, 2 shows a day
My rollie gold, no time to waste
What it do Berg? My fuckin' brother
Keep that pistol by me like my lovely momma
Hot as the summer, cold as the winter
Stay on them charts, I heard that they plotting my timber
Young nigga, got a lot of flows
Any nigga don't believe me, I make it look easy, easy out of control

[Interlude: Birdman]
Just like that boy
That fo bigs honor
Ya understand me?
Dedication, respect, fully loaded, yeah

[Verse 3: Birdman]
Box full of choppers, hand on the trigger
Uptown gangsta, get it how we get it
Third Ward soldier, suicide rider
Militant minded, hundred mill on the counter
Hand-Persian rug nigga, flame on the Bugatti
Christian Louboutin, Chanel for my models
Higher than Bugatti nigga, fishing on the fish scales
Nose diving for them hundreds, strapped up making mail
Fr-fresher than I been before
Higher than we even been, shining on them 24's
Junior doing time ho
On the grind ho, while he doing time ho

[Interlude: Mack Maine]
Ya know!
The time is money and money still was made baby
Eight months ain't stop nothing nigga
It's like jail was third base and my lil' nigga still came home, ya understand

[Verse 4: Mack Maine]
I'm from the hood where bitches hold coke in they baby diapers
That's why when the babies grow up damn they be like us
I came a long ways from rhyming up in crazy cyphers
Man I'm so happy my lil' brother came home from Rikers
Shout out to BP, Thugga, Flow and [Fail Boy?]
My flow Lucifer, I spit hell boy
My heart numb, ain't no pain I can't withstand
And I hold my niggas down boy like a kickstand
Get off my nuts, stop acting like a bitch fam
Lil' nigga finish puberty, grow ya own dick damn
I went from watching time fly on Earl and Red porch
To cruising through the streets of Miami in a red Porsche
Me and Stunna fly, we should join the Air Force
Stand up niggas, the fuck you brought them chairs for?
I went from making money from people with crack habits
To thanking God I'm in a whole 'nother tax bracket
Amen

[Outro: DJ Khaled]

[Verse 1: Future]
A million dollar cash on me in the studio when I did this verse
My money is longer, my weed is stronger
All my bitches is badder, these niggas is sadder
My rubies got chalice so fuck all the chatter
Tissued the money, I rest on them plaques
King of the Patek, clarity showing without even knowing
Jump out that Lambo with the red bottoms on
The capital going up heavy in Florence
Duffel of Franks just to boost my endurance
Two number ones in a row

Lamborghini got a S, Sierra Leone baguettes, yeah

Yo, yo

Who lied and said you next? Crying emojis in my group texts
Stay in your bum-ass duplex, it's Minaj, no group sex
Queen never shuffle, you deal
Just turned down a four-million-dollar shoe deal
Keep your man off my Instagram, bitch
99 problems but ain't one a damn bitch
G4-fly even when I land, bitch
Lookin' like Pocahontas, yeah, they want my land, bitch
I'm just exotic, bitch, chronic bitch
Shoe game on psychotic, bitch
Yes, I am iconic, bitch
P-Pussy get 'em hooked like phonics, sis
Every ball player tryna find this bitch
Ball hard but I'm too fine to fine this bitch
I graduated with honors, bitch

Full throttle switch
Pick a side, pick a side, they gotta switch
Big MAC billboard out in Times Square

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
You mad or you jealous, you sad or you settle
The brighter the rainbow, the badder the weather
The good with the bad, but the badder the better
Bring my sand to the beach, nigga, and to the desert
We fell from the heavens, we landed like feathers
The rose in the rubble, keep your nose out our petals
Your hoes know my schedule, and my hoes know I'm special
They know not to question, bitch, you know I'm not Alexa
She, she post a pic of me and her from off her iPad
You know them hoes don't like that, where the likes at?
Jealousy is a disease, you can die mad
Tunechi, Sean, CB, Khaled, hi there (Yeah, yeah, yeah)

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Brown, DJ Khaled, & Lil Wayne]

Don't want us together, 'gether, 'gether (Together)

[Verse 3: Big Sean]
Dawg, it's these jealous ass hoes I can't relate to
The type to follow you but hardly follow through
You say I'm on your mind, I'm wondering why I'm not on you
Girl, you're fresh out the shower
Towel around your head like you're Erykah Badu
It's lookin' like a spa day
I rearrange your chakras, listenin' to Sade
Let's take a road trip and get high on the highway (Swerve, swerve)
Migrate, spend time, lay back, watch the sky change, woah
And I hear the jealousy, but look, I never listen
The quickest way to let something die is lack of attention (Straight up)
And you got it all, you looking good as my intentions (Damn)
We on an ascension, straight up

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Brown & DJ Khaled]
But girl, I can tell you need some love in your life (Let's ride)
And I'm the one, don't let no one change your mind (Oh)
Fuck what they say (Fuck 'em)

[Chorus: Chris Brown & DJ Khaled]
Girl, they just jealous, jealous, jealous (Let's go)
Don't want us together, 'gether, 'gether
Girl, they just jealous, jealous, jealous (Oh, oh, woah)

Girl, they just jealous, jealous, jealous (Woah)
Don't want us together, 'gether, 'gether (Woah)

Don't want us together, 'gether, 'gether (Together)

[Bridge: Chris Brown & DJ Khaled]
These boys scared I'ma take they chick (They chick)

You could drop a dime, but I make it make sense

Pull up on me, girl, let's get lit (Get lit)
I think I hit a lick
I think I hit a lick, yeah (Another one)

[Chorus: Chris Brown & DJ Khaled]

I'm touchin' triple digits, now it's tangible
I'm touchin' M's now my life is pandemonium
I go and re-up on you, new Aventadors
Everything around me too colossal
You niggas old news like a fossil
Every single night I got a bad bitch
She didn't come alone, she came with another bad one
I done caught a vibe and a wave, double jeopardy
They know I'm the king of these melodies
You know I was in the bando, smellin' like a half a key
You can smell the molly comin' off me when you next to me
Put it in my cup and let me medicate
And it all started off with foreplay (with foreplay)
Cappuccino vodkas in Santa Monica (Santa Monica)
We was best friends until the fall out
Now I got the lawyers goin' all out

[Chorus: Bryson Tiller]
It's just the way it is, oh

These niggas beat me to it

[Verse 2: Bryson Tiller]
Hey, I been reaping those rewards
From my hard work, I'm startin' to see the jealousy
Hey, they talkin' shit, that's what they tellin' me
What? They rather tell somebody else instead of me
Okay, hey, I got my dollas, my cash up
They wanna see me on my last one
(last one)
They tell you things you don't wanna hear
They don't wanna see me with a bad one
No, or see you in a Benz wagon
With your new bag on
The bag that these hatin' bitches
Only spend a hundred plus tax on
The one we spent five racks on
And I love to get on tracks that I can rap and spit facts on
I'm the one that niggas love to turn they backs on
Yeah, that's cool with me, that's cool with me
Another one
Another one

[Chorus: Bryson Tiller]
It's just the way it is, oh
(Just the way)
These niggas beat me to it
Yeah, these niggas started changin', oh no

They wanna separate it, they try and tear us down
They tryna tear us down

It's alright, yeah

Money fallin' out of my pocket (hey!)

Jewelry lookin' like a slushie fresh up out the blender
Maybe I hit her, maybe I didn't
Even if I did, I don't remember
Been a player since the very beginning
Stones in my charm, never my denim, no
Chain flooded like the levee broke, huh, incredible
Rappin', it was either that or sellin' dope, shit, let the dice roll
Now diamonds all on top of diamonds, huh?
Drippin', let you know I gotta go
I catch you anywhere, you get strong-armed
I'm talkin' upstream on a paddle boat
Okay one car, two shoes
You in hot water like a pack of noodles
Yeah, wife-beater, no tattoos

Ran it up and I had to go and bust it
Police 'bout to kick the door, now we gotta flush it
Ridin' on the backstreets thinkin' 'bout my brother
Prayin' that he come home to his loving mother

Nigga tried to try me like I was a gimmick (Exposed)
Now I got a number one and they hear me

You heard that? I was trappin' and I had to take a bird bath (Yeah)
Guns on me, I was going down the wrong path
I'm humble with the money and I don't cry
Beat me at the game, I'ma grab it (Grab it)
I stock out my paints in the cabin (Stocked out)
Drippin' too clean like a napkin (Drip-drip-drip)
She was on a bean with her rack out (The bean)
Money to the racks so I lap 'em (Woo)
Don't give 'em a formula, I cap 'em (Nah)
I'm from the jungle, I'm an animal (Rah)
You bitches ain't shit, they scandalous (Woo)
Knock his head off, I commanded him (Boo)
I'm from the bando, my daddy had abandoned me (Bando)
Momma tried to cover up and bandage me (Mama)
I'm the first one to lead the whole legacy (Legacy)

[Chorus: Offset]
Put blindsides on my eye, young nigga, I can feel the money (I can feel the racks)
I got some young niggas pull on the opps, and they kill for money (They slide, they slide)
You ever felt a zombie? (Who?) Yo' body gon' smell like vomit (Ooh)
They thought I would fail, I conquer (Fail)
I swim with the sharks, piranhas (Piranha)
You tattletale, informant (Twelve)
I move like a boss, I'm important (Boss)

Neck, wrist on chandelier (Chandelier)
Made me wanna drop some tears (Tears)
Thankin' God that I switched gears (Whooo)
I'm from another lightyear, I'm a Martian (Martian)
One-third of a human, just partial (One third)
I'm the Sergeant, the Captain, the Marshal (Serge)
I start to barf, it was too much potion
Too fast, everything in slow motion
I get the cash and my money keep grossin' (Get the cash)
Popped a bottle, champagne, we toastin'

[Verse 2: J. Cole]
Baptized at First Baptist Church
The pastor name was Reverend Johnson (Okay)
Chastised his shirt and matchin' shoes
But had to front, it never bothered him (Okay)
Hurt his pride but he swallowed it (Okay)
Dirt is all that he spotted
And in the dirty south where bodies pilin' up
So high, they block the birds and rerouted 'em (Damn)
Plenty murderers had observers but
You never heard a peep out of them
So many funerals it ain't enough numerals to keep count of them (Woah)
Look, I'm just settin' the scene
Back when I stared at the phone as I'm lettin' it ring
Another collector, they leave us a message
My mama in deficit, must intervene
I bust out the seams, I'm gettin' too big for these britches now
I invest in the dream, I'm destined for green
I got superstar dick for these bitches now
I got superstar dick for these bitches now
And I think about that when I dig 'em out
(When I dig 'em out, when I dig 'em out)

[Chorus: Offset]

[Intro: Big Rube]
Yeah, you already know what it is (Swerve)
It's noisy off the set path
How can I make choices I've yet to discover we have?
Must need rehab
If you think you know me from the facets they show these folks to get money, I gotta laugh
How funny it is you don't realize the skill lies in knowing within the truth there's still lies
It's called being civilized
But not to trivialize your belief in the semi-fictionalized
I am who you see
What you hear is part of me
But there's so much more to me
So much more to be than just alive
A son, a brother, a husband, a father
But still can go even farther
Wish and will, can go harder
In that time, I went the hardest
More than this generic term "artist"
A reality smith, you love my craftsmanship
Because I craft some shit to make my people proud
And so I speak aloud, but not loud enough yet
Or as loud as I can get
They think I ain't a threat
But all preconceived notions, I've arrived
To Offset

[Chorus: Offset]
I was seventeen years old when I had you (When I had you)
Tryna find my soul when I had you (When I had you)
I was oh so broke when I had you (When I had you)
Locked up down the road when I had you (When I had you)
Jordan, sorry I wasn't there for all your birthdays
I tried to hit, and I wasn't rich, I had no workplace
My son, Kody, he three, rappin' already like me
Ridin' in the car, you don't play me, then he gon' scream

[Verse 1: Offset]
Kalea, you my first, first daughter
I missed the first years of your life, I'm sorry
Tell the truth, I ain't really know if I was your father
Tell the truth, I really don't even know your mama
But I had to step up, my daddy had left us
Even though we gotta catch up, pray to God that he bless us
I'ma keep grindin' for my kids, never gon' let up
I'ma put the money up for y'all, I can't be selfish
Had a baby as a kid, mama kicked me out
Had to go and hit a lick, tryna put food in your mouth
Then I got caught for the shit, in the pen when she pushed you out
Your mama tried to push me down, ain't let me stay at the house

[Chorus: Offset]
I was seventeen years old when I had you (When I had you)
Tryna find my soul when I had you (When I had you)
I was oh so broke when I had you (When I had you)
Locked up down the road when I had you (When I had you)
Jordan, sorry I wasn't there for all your birthdays
I tried to hit, and I wasn't rich, I had no workplace
My son Kody, he three, rappin' already like me
Ridin' in the car, you don't play me, then he gon' scream

[Verse 2: Offset]
I'm a father of four, gotta get that cash, gold
Keep my past closed, 'member I ain't had no dough
Spend a big bag on clothes, Gucci from the head to toes
Not two, not three, all four, that's all they know
Kulture, remind me of my grandma, feel like she is closer
Gotta thank your mama, she hold me like holsters
Gotta protect her from the world, I can't even post her
Ups and downs in this fame, roller coaster
If I don't ball, then everything 'round me fall
I'm prayin' to God to watch my kids, that's my all...

[Chorus: Offset]
I was seventeen years old when I had you (When I had you)
Tryna find my soul when I had you (When I had you)
I was oh so broke when I had you (When I had you)
Locked up down the road when I had you (When I had you)
Jordan, sorry I wasn't there for all your birthdays
I tried to hit, and I wasn't rich, I had no workplace
My son Kody, he three, rappin' already like me
Ridin' in the car, you don't play me, then he gon' scream

[Intro]
And I apologize, you know what I'm sayin'? Breaking your heart, breaking our promise, breaking God's promise, and being a, a, selfish and messed up husband, you know what I'm sayin'? I'm, I'm tryn- I'm tryna be a better person. I wanna get this off-
Give a little game
Buy a new chain
Put in that thang
Blow out the brains

[Verse 1]
Drip a little stain on 'em
Put a little game on 'em
Fuck around and put a ring on 'em
You beat it out the frame, don't you? (I'ma beat it)

(Hey) I took a couple of my dawgs on a lick

Born in the wild, so many trials, I ain't quit
All the people I robbed, I brought 'em down, I repent (Down)
Dirtied the money, I let it drown, watch it cleanse (Cleanse)

No bond when you do a crime, slavery repeat (Slave)
Slick minded, they think we runnin' a treasury (Who)
Lost my homie, it keep on hauntin' me in my sleep
Lost my grandmama, whole family incomplete
Stabbed in my back a million times, this shit deep
I was hittin' licks doin' crime for my seed
Broke now I got 25 cars, it's a fleet
Take notes, make a bando turn Ferrari, I can teach
Struggled with the pain, but I still turned out a beast
I got out the chains, now the world belong to me (Hey)

[Chorus]
(Hey) I took a couple of my dawgs on a lick

It's so lonely in the light, it's lonely, I repeat
But I cannot cry
And I'm acting like I cannot die
But I've gotta burn brighter
To be the north star in the dark night sky
And I just can't cry
They're acting like I cannot die
'Cause I've gotta burn brighter
To be the north star in the dark night sky

[Bridge: CeeLo Green]
Look up, look down and look around for me
I'll cast a shadow on the ground for me (Look high up)

And I'll always be there, I will always be there
Don't look down or look around for me
I'll cast a shadow on the ground for me (Look high up)
'Cause I'll be high up in the sky
And I'll always be there, I will always be there

[Outro: CeeLo Green]
'Cause I'm the north star in the dark night sky

Yes, I could die
To be the north star in the dark night sky
Can't cry
Yes, I could die
To be the north star in the dark night sky

I can never fold on none of my niggas

I got niggas serving bricks out the fender
That Karma keep coming back when I was getting it
A lot of you niggas be changing when you get famous
Talking that shit but you really not gangster
These niggas claiming that they 'bout it 'bout it
We pull them choppers out and homicide them
We used to trap up at the Texacos
Never sold my soul I had to take the blow

Lost everything I had like Solomon
Got it back it's like I hit the lottery
For my fans I gotta say apologies
They holding me down and they ride for me

[Verse 1: Offset]
A hundred thousand for a Plain Jane
When you locked up, got to maintain
Caught a Fed case with the cocaine
Start telling names, playing blame games
That ain't the shit that I call a hunna
I was the boss and you was the runner
I cooked the dope while she count the commas
If she run with the money I kill her momma
Do you really fuck with me? Sometimes I wonder
What was you at when that drought was coming
You be bumping your gums but ain't saying nothing
Got your bitch in the condo we have a slumber
I might pull up with a hundred bricks in a Hummer
I can not tell cause the code that I honour
I know one nigga who came from the jungle
He told me get money, don't want nothing from you

[Chorus: Offset]
I can never fold on none of my niggas
I'm the one they talk about be demented
I got niggas serving bricks out the fender

Talking that shit but you really not gangster
These niggas claiming that they 'bout it 'bout it
We pull them choppers out and homicide them
We used to trap up at the Texacos
Never sold my soul I had to take the blow
Had to understand I had to sacrifice
I was living life I had to pay the price
Lost everything I had like Solomon
Got it back it's like I hit the lottery

I ain't tryna put it in your throat
Bitch you know I am the goat

Blurred vision I just poured a four

Your car is a lease
My wrist 40 piece
And my ear 10 a piece
Your bitch like to eat
So much dab it's a feast
We came from the street
Put the gang on they feet

I'm living my dream
My Glock got a beam
My phone keep on ringing
Diamonds shine like oil sheen
Birds keep on singing
Bitch drink my semen
Money bring demons
But God gonna clean it
I'm on the percolator
Suck on my dick and you masturbate it
My niggas celebrating
Then we got money then elevated
The magazine illustrated
Talk about Migos we really made it
Trapping and capping baby
Now I'm trafficking the records baby
Cocaine, selling cocaine
Smoking cookie, propane
Might take your hoe mayne
Ima boozie young nigga eating lo mein
Free the Wop mane
I let my dope swang

[Hook]
I ain't tryna put it in your throat
Bitch you know I am the goat

Your bitch like to eat
So much dab it's a feast
We came from the street
Put the gang on they feet

[Chorus: Offset]
I'm a rich nigga
You're a broke nigga
Should've had a pussy you a ho nigga
If the police call a nigga I don't know nigga

Dropped out of high school just to hit some licks
When I walk into the mall they wanna take a pic
All teachers told me I wouldn't make it

Hundred birds fly south let my niggas break 'em down
Niggas talking bout its ready get it in and get it out

Coming through the checkpoint
Don't make it then i'll probably lay a pussy nigga down
Blue bricks in the wrist in the shit
Gotta brick off a split
I was broke, now I'm fixed
Put my niggas in the mix
Now they running with the bricks
With the bricks and the sticks
Tryna get a hundred bricks
Unload 'em off the palette
Put em in the alley
Shit gets tragic when your fuckin' with a package
They put em in the trap then they put em in baggage
Then they get gone like a nigga never had it
Abracadabra like god damn I know magic
Like Houdini with bricks, I do it fantastic
Hundred bricks put em in the trap, nigga
Hundred bricks put em on a map!

[Chorus: Offset]

[Verse 2: Offset]
I got a plug up in Cali

Look at my watch, its got so many carats
Got birds in my kitchen, got pigeons got parrots
Got bombs on me, you think i'm a terrorist
I pull up in Phantom ghost it is scary
Got a bitch cooking dope she a Brazilian
Stayed in the kitchen got me a whole million
Giuseppe walking alligator amphibian
I came from the trap and the dope will stay ignorant
I talk to El Chapo he send me some tacos
I went to the lot and bought me a Gallardo
I'm a street nigga go check out my bio
I got so much money you think I hit the lotto
Im a supplier, before you set foot in my trap
I check you looking for the wire
I built the empire
My plug on a boat like a pirate
If you running up on me imma start up a riot
Im cooking up fish nigga, it's time to eat it
Bon appetite, have a feast
My bitch just landed from Greece
Red bottoms under her feet
I'm loving that bitch cause her daddy got keys!

Listen to me when I talk and I don't need a beat, I go acapella
Diamonds dancing, when the camera flashing you gon know when we up in here
I made the choice to go sell some dope
I got money that I never seen before
Let that bitch ride my dick on her tippy toes
I could never fall, I won't lie under oath
Made the choice to get the money
Thanking God because the devil after me
Gotta show that they [?]
And I'm ballin' on niggas like after league
Back to the basics, gotta get these faces
Took the shit, they came with choices, embraced it
Thugga told me that these bitches be brazy
Put your dick in her mouth and tell her taste it
Came a long way rappin' in momma basement
We married the money, we skilled in engagement
Roll the backwood and I sit down and face it
All my choices, I sit down and face it

[Hook: Offset]
I fell in love with the money, I cut these bitches off and divorced them

Take 'em all to the spot, get some shit from Jabbar
Diamonds bright like a star, cookin' fish scales with no tar
Diamonds fighting, goin' to war
Roll that pussy like a car
Suck that dog then make it bark
Put that sloppy joe head in a cart
I dive in that pussy its deep
What's your service for me?
Baby what is your choice?
You choose them or choose me?
You chose him cause he was a dork
You didn't care about hurting me
You dirty dirty, girl you dirty, I hope he leave you in the streets

Young nigga had a dream to be a ball player
Young nigga had a dream to be a ball player

[Hook]
Young nigga had a dream to be a ball player
He was poor, he didn't have no clothes, hung out with the hard heads
Selling dope, his momma ain't know, his trap going retarded
Young nigga started with a dream and now he is the cartel

[Verse]
Young nigga gotta keep your face good
If you run off you will never get a major plug
I can't wait till Takeoff Jackson give me them Harriet Tubs
I had a dream that I was a baller but I couldn't make the buzzer
Then it got ugly, I was broke, so I trapped with my cousin
Then I start rapping, niggas laughed at me, we started juugin' then we starting' buzzin'
We came from nothing, so I bought me a Lamb and I punch it
My engine sound like Jumanji, extended clip like a bungee
My momma didn't know nothing
Young nigga tryna make it
Smokin' on cookie Jamaican
I'm Trapping out the bando vacant
Now I got a bad bitch from Malaysia

[Hook]
Young nigga had a dream to be a ball player

Got a little freaky bitch and she gorgeous
Balmain sag on the Saint Laurent

Diamonds hittin' like a Mortal Kombat punch
Servin' that cool, same color Nestle Crunch
Stackin' them hundreds up, I got a bunch

Stay with that Glock, nigga know who I trust
Still in the trap, nigga servin' that raw dust
Come get your ho ,'cause you know she wan' fuck
Designer drugs serve like I'm wearin' a Gucci tux
Ride two cars back to back when I'm re-ing up
I'm on them percs, chasin' like I was on Tuss
Givenchy, gelato when I'm rollin' up
Me and Offset strapped up in the Bentley truck
Ooh, she suck it good, make it touch and bust
Too bad that lil bitch couldn't make the cut

Too many chains on, my bitch start whining
Diamonds big rock like I'm mountain climbing

I can never fold on none of my niggas
I'm the one they talk about be the menace
I got niggas serving bricks out the fender
That Karma keep coming back when I was getting it
A lot of you niggas be changing when you get famous
Talking that shit but you really not gangster
These niggas claiming that they bout it bout it
We pull them choppers out and homicide them
We used to trap up at the Texaco
Never sold my soul I had to take the blow
Hand to understand I had to sacrifice
I was living life I had to pay the price
Lost everything I had like Solomon
Got it back like it's like I hit the lottery
For my fans I gotta say apologies
They holding me down and they ride for me

[Verse 1]
A hundred thousand for a Plain Jane
When you locked up, got to maintain
Caught a Fed case with the cocaine
Start telling names, playing blame games
That ain't the shit that I call a hunna
I was the boss and you was the runner
I cooked the dope while she count the commas
If she run with the money I kill her momma
Do you really fuck with me? Sometimes I wonder
Where was you at when that drought was coming
You be bumping your gun but ain't saying nothing
Got your bitch in the condo we have a slumber
I might pull up with a hundred bricks in a Hummer
I cannot tell cause the code that I honor
I know one nigga who came from the jungle
He told me get money, don't want nothing from you

[Hook]
I can never fold on none of my niggas
I'm the one they talk about be the menace

These niggas claiming that they bout it bout it
We pull them choppers out and homicide them
We used to trap up at the Texaco
Never sold my soul I had to take the blow
Hand to understand I had to sacrifice

She's on a strict diet, that's my baby
With no makeup, she a ten
And she the best with that head
Even better than Karrine
She don't want money
She want the time that we could spend
She said, "'Cause I really need somebody
So tell me you're that somebody"
Girl, I fuck who I want, and fuck who I don't
Got that A1 credit, that's that filet mignon
She said, "I never want to make you mad
I just want to make you proud"
I said, "Baby, just make me cum
Then don't make a sound"

Uh, real nigga, fuck these haters
These hoes got pussies like craters
Can't treat these hoes like ladies, man
Pussy, money, weed, codeine
She said my dick feel like morphine
I hope my name taste like sardines to these niggas
She wake up, eat this dick
Call that breakfast in bed, 69, 96
I feel her heartbeat, I chest-to-chest with this bitch
Now turn around, face down; I'm arrestin' this bitch
Yeah, all my bitches love me, and I love all my bitches
But it's like as soon as I cum, I come to my senses
And I would say these hoes' names
But then I would be snitchin'
And these haters try to knock me
But they can't knock me off the hinges

[Pre-Chorus: Future, Lil Wayne, & Both]
I'm on that good kush and alcohol (Tunech)
I got some down bitches I can call (What's happenin'?)
I don't know what I would do without y'all (I don't know what I would do without y'all)
I'ma ball 'til the day I fall (I'ma ball, ball, ball) (I'ma ball)

[Chorus: Drake, Future, & Lil Wayne]
Yeah, long as my bitches love me (My bitches love) (Yeah, yeah; yeah, yeah)
I can give a fuck 'bout no hater
Long as my bitches love me (My bitches love me, my bitches love me, my bitches love me) (Yeah, yeah; yeah, yeah; yeah, yeah)
Yeah, I can give a fuck 'bout no nigga (Yeah)
Long as these bitches love me

[Produced by Boi-1da and Vinylz]

[Chorus: Drake]
I'm the only one that get the job done
I don't know a nigga that could cover for me
Yeah, got some game from my dad
He said she might say she love me
She don't love me like she say she love me
Believe me, believe me
I'm that nigga, boy they love me in the streets
I'm not tryna find nobody else to beat
I'm the one they come to see because they all
Believe me

[Verse 1: Drake]
Yeah, rip, rip rip
It's been me and Young Tune off the rip
That's the man that put me in this shit
If a nigga fuck with him, I'll put him down quick
Got a verse for anybody wanna talk about the clique
I've been takin' shit light, you don't wanna hear me trip
God damn, do y'all really know who y'all fuckin' with?
Yeah, I mean you can't blame me for wonderin'
Doesn't matter, could be winter or the summer
On the road, I do One Direction numbers, I don't fuckin' miss
Yeah, Stunna and Mack know
When Wayne was gone for eight months, we put this thing up on our back
And I was snappin' off on every single track though
Collect call from the boss like where we at though
I was like, "Hah, it's our time, nigga"
He left Rikers in a Phantom, that's my nigga
And I'll been rockin' with the team 'til Carter IX
And we YMCMB, waitin' on somebody to try us, nigga
Yeah

[Chorus: Drake]
I'm the only one that get the job done
I don't know a nigga that could cover for me
Yeah, got some game from my dad
He said she might say she love me
She don't love me like she say she love me
Believe me, believe me
I'm that nigga, boy they love me in the streets
I'm not tryna find nobody else to beat
I'm the one they come to see because they all
Believe me

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
Lord knows I'll murk one of these niggas, yeah
His and hers Ferraris, nigga
One for me, one for my daughter, nigga
Waitin' for someone to test me like a Harvard nigga
I tote a 223, two Michael Jordans, nigga
Come on, fight these shell cases like a lawyer, nigga
Find out where you stay, and act like we found some oil, nigga
Out of duct tape so when he prayin' I ignore the nigga
All I gotta say is "sayonara, nigga"
Drop dead gorgeous but the bitch ain't dyin' for a nigga
Where the real queens at? Shout out Capone and Noreaga
We can shoot it out and see who live to tell the story later
Diamonds in my Rollie face cannot be exfoliated
They think I'm associated, I'm the one that orchestrated
Yayo get her ass whipped, whip that ass like horses racin'
Ain't 'bout what you walk away from, it's 'bout what you walk away with
Dead Presidents, them coffins vacant
I must be doin' somethin'

[Chorus: Drake]
I'm the only one that get the job done
I don't know a nigga that could cover for me
Yeah, got some game from my dad
He said she might say she love me
She don't love me like she say she love me
Believe me, believe me
I'm that nigga, boy they love me in the streets
I'm not tryna find nobody else to beat
I'm the one they come to see because they all
Believe me

[Verse 3: Drake]
Had to get it poppin' off the rip
Rich young nigga that ain't never had to trick
Slim Thug flow but you know I like 'em thick
If she get a job at DOA, I drop her off a tip
I had to get it poppin' off the rip
I'm the one they tell yah been reppin' in the 6
Come into the city and yah niggas get to trippin'
We'll take yah to the Scarborough Bluff and drop you off a cliff
Well damn, just be happy for the man
Nirvana, Coldplay, nigga got bands
Ink from the money, got it all over my hands
Goin' out to Houston, spendin' all of my advance
V Live just took me for a cheque
"Drake you know I love you, you just took me outta debt"
Yes, right now you are lookin' at the best
Mothafuck award shows and mothafuck the press like that

[Verse 4: Lil Wayne]
Mothafuck the rest
When they jumped off the porch, I was stumblin' up the steps
I'd give what I collect before I give up my connect
It'd be a cold day in Hell, icicles made of sweat
One finger, slidin' 'cross my neck
Niggas know what that mean like they deaf
Nigga I'll fire this nina like it's her first day
On the job and the bitch overslept
Tune stay humble, nigga I'm a king
Need a horn and a drumroll
They throw mothafuckin' roses at my feet, nigga
I don't step on one rose
I'm the only one that get the job done
I don't know a nigga that can cover for me
Tape a couple kilos to the bitch stomach
She look like she got a bun in the oven from me
Preheat, believe me
All you gotta do is pay me every week
I had these bitches havin' babies every week
I'm the nigga, see me skatin' in the streets
Gone

[Outro: Drake]
Rip rip, nigga

[Intro: Kendrick Lamar]
I got a story to tell, you know that I cherish thee
Hope it ain't too many feelings involved

[Chorus: Lil Wayne]
I see niggas in this bitch
Stuntin', poppin' bottles
Gettin' drunk with these bitches
And when they leave they get followed
Fall asleep with that bitch
And really don't know much about her
Then she let us in, we take all of your shit
And when you wake up, she help you try to find it, I love it

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
I be with bitches that be with bitches
That be with niggas with riches
I tell her, "Get him," she say, "I got you"
I say, "No, bitch, I said get him"
And they so pretty, and they hair lengthy
He hit it and sleep on her titties
Then she give us the word, we come through with AKs
It's a stick-up, she scream like a victim
Now you feelin' so silly
I smoke color purple, I'm up in here feelin' like Celie (Ooh)
Nappy-ass dreads, what's that you say?
Watch your mouth, Milli Vanilli (Ooh)
You can get snaked, you can get faked
Out by the bitch that you feelin'
'Cause you thought that she was an angel
That bitch ain't no angel, I treat her halo like a frisbee
And you tellin' your business, she tell me your business
You tell that bitch what you feelin'
All of the beans you be spillin'
To you, she lie through her teeth cavities, fillin's
She know where you hide to tell me where it's hidden
She know when you're gone, tell me when to visit
We break in your home and take the specifics
And meanwhile, the bitch is on vacation with him
So she don't get blamed, we don't snatch chains
We find out addresses, and we don't leave messes
You'll only know that it's gone when you check it
Then your first thought is to start second guessin'
She say, "What's wrong?" He say, "Nothin', keep restin'"
She say, "What's missin'?", "How you know somethin' missin'?"
He scratch his head, she say, "Get back in bed"
And she gave him some head
Boy, you can't trust them bitches, and then she say'ooh

[Chorus: Lil Wayne]
I see niggas in this bitch
Stuntin', poppin' bottles
Gettin' drunk with these bitches
Then when they leave they get followed
I be with bitches that know the bitches
That's with the niggas we followin'
Get them on the line, stay two cars behind
And tell them hoes, "Don't be so obvious!"
Mona Lisa, long hair, don't care
She handle the business and don't ever tell
She bite the bullet and cough up the shells
She tell 'em, "Ooh, daddy, let's go to your place!"
And if he say yeah, then we meet him there
She feed him lies with his silverware
She don't want love, she just want her share

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
I know a bitch named Liz
This nigga think she his 'cause she tell him that it is
So he tell her all his secrets, he tell her all his fears
And then she tell me and I be all ears
And then I go and tell my people and they already know him
And then I call Liz and she say he comin' over
I say, "Good girl, just remember what I told ya"
She gave me the salute, I say, "Girl, you're a soldier"
We're waitin' outside, watch him pull up
Walk up to the door and right before he knock
She open the door naked, she left it unlocked
They started French kissin' so he didn't see moi
And then she let him in, they stopped on the couch
Music up loud with his head in the clouds
Turn that shit down and I scared the piss out of him
Piss a nigga off, put a gun to his frown
Nigga, turn around, I ain't here to fuck around
I ain't here to fuck around, caught you wit' your pants down
You know what it is, put your fuckin' hands up
Liz, that's enough, you can put your hands down
And then he looked dead at her and he shook his head at her
She a good actress and you a dead actor
You'll be dead after we get what we're after
If Liz call you daddy, she about to be a bastard, oh
I got way too many bitches that do anything for me, nigga
But think for me, nigga
Send her to you like she ain't for me, nigga
I hope you alone like bankruptcy, nigga
She pour you a drink, that drank on me, nigga
She slip somethin' in it, now faint for me, nigga
Mona Lisa, I done painted the picture
Mo-Mona Lisa, out the frame on these niggas
Pussy got you out of character, nigga
You fall for these hoes off your ladder, my nigga
Take everything that you have 'til you don't even have an opinion
We have your attention
And now you're lookin' down a barrel though, nigga
Now she lookin' for her pantyhose, nigga
We just lookin' for the casserole, nigga
But she gon' show us where you stash it though, nigga (Mona)

[Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar]
Ah, every day she wake up with a different color makeup
And a promise he gone take her to the movie and the mall
Chillin' with the Laker, on the floor, fourth quarter
Four minute on the clock, Black Mamba with the ball
Paparazzi lookin' at 'em both poppin' up and take a picture, uh
Probably on a Internet blog
In a minute, he gon' be admittin' that he love her on his mother
Man, he want to meet her mother by tomorrow
Mona Lisa
Pussy good enough, it got him sinnin' in the walls
And he diggin' in it like he livin' in it
Make a new religion with it, man a nigga 'bout to go against God
Poetry in a pear tree
Sweet tone like a hummingbird when she asked him
Did he want to make love in a yellow taxi
Never gave two fucks, jumped in the backseat
Woke up in the morning to The Great Gatsby
Then he dogged it again like the bitch Lassie
I'm a dog in the wind, I'm a pit laughing
I'ma call up again like I did last week
Make good with the friend and I'm all jazzy
Britney with the twin and the girl Ashley
Found out that I fucked, he was unhappy
Bitch, I never let the bullshit get past me
Better yet, I wanna break up, don't you ask me
'Bout a motherfuckin' double standard, acting
Fucking on another nigga, that's a negative alone
But you sucked this dick? That's just nasty
Matter of fact, bitch, gimme your phone! (No!)
You fuckin' with Wayne's? (No!)
Bitch, gimme your phone! (No!)
Let me, let me take this call real quick
(' lick me like a lollipop) He on your fuckin' ringtone?
Is that the shit that you do? [sniffing]
Touchin' yourself, lookin' at Kendrick videos
Jump on the internet, watchin' his interviews
I don't know what the fuck lately got into you
Tell me who love you, I bet I love harder
Forgot all the shit that I did for your daughter?
The Pampers, the Pedialyte and my momma
Daycare after school and she never did charge ya
You scandalous as fuck and I hope you blow up
You know what? I give up, let me go get my gun
I got one in the chamber I'm plannin' on aimin'
Goddammit, you know that the damage is done
Bitch I'm emotional 'cause I'm in stress
I'm not supposed to go through this, I guess
So in conclusion, since you like rappers that's killin' that pussy
I'm killin' myself

[Refrain: Lil Wayne]
She say, ooh, Daddy, ooh, Mona Lisa, Mona Lisa
Ooh, fake smile, Mona Lisa, Mona Lisa
She say, ooh, no emotion, Mona Lisa, Mona Lisa
Now he get the picture, Mona Lisa, Mona Lisa, yeah

[Chorus: Harry Belafonte]
Six-foot, seven-foot, eight-foot bunch
Six-foot, seven-foot, eight-foot bunch

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
Ahem, excuse my charisma, vodka with a spritzer
Swagger down pat; call my shit Patricia
Young Money militia and I am the commissioner
You no wan' start Weezy 'cause the 'F' is for finisher
So misunderstood, but what's a world without enigma?
Two bitches at the same time; synchronized swimmers
Got the girl twisted 'cause she open when you twist her
Never met the bitch, but I fuck her like I missed her
Life is the bitch, and death is her sister
Sleep is the cousin'what a fuckin' family picture
You know Father Time, and we all know Mother Nature
It's all in the family, but I am of no relation
No matter who's buyin', I'm a celebration
Black and white diamonds; fuck segregation
Fuck that shit, my money up, you niggas just Honey Nut
Young Money runnin' shit, and you niggas just runner-ups
I don't feel I done enough, so I'ma keep on doin' this shit
Lil Tunechi or Young Tuna Fish

[Chorus: Harry Belafonte]
Six-foot, seven-foot, eight-foot bunch
Six-foot, seven-foot, eight-foot bunch

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
(I'm goin' back in')
Okay, I lost my mind, it's somewhere out there stranded
I think you stand under me if you don't understand me
Had my heart broken by this woman named Tammy
But hoes gon' be hoes, so I couldn't blame Tammy
Just talked to Moms, told her she the sweetest
I beat the beat up; call it self-defense
Swear, man, I be seein' through these niggas like sequins
Niggas think they He-Men, pow, pow, the end
Talkin' to myself because I am my own consultant
Married to the money, fuck the world; that's adultery
You full of shit, you close your mouth and let yo' ass talk
Young Money eatin', all you haters do is add salt
Stop playin', bitch, I got this game on deadbolt
Mind so sharp I fuck around and cut my head off
Real nigga all day and tomorrow
But these motherfuckers talkin' crazy like they jaw broke
Glass half empty, half full, I'll spill ya
Try me and run into a wall; outfielder
You know I'ma ball 'til they turn off the field lights
The fruits of my labor, I enjoy 'em while they still ripe
Bitch, stop playin', I do it like a king do
If these niggas animals, then I'ma have a mink soon
Tell 'em bitches I say put my name on the wall
I speak the truth, but I guess that's a foreign language to y'all
And I call it like I see it, and my glasses on
But most of y'all don't get the picture 'less the flash is on
Satisfied with nothin', you don't know the half of it
Young Money, Cash Money
Paper chasin', tell that paper, "Look, I'm right behind ya"
Bitch, real Gs move in silence like lasagna
People say I'm borderline crazy, sorta kinda
Woman of my dreams, I don't sleep so I can't find her
You niggas are gelatin, peanuts to an elephant
I got through that sentence like a subject and a predicate
Yeah, with a swag you would kill for
Money too strong; pockets on bodybuilder
Jumped in a wishin' well, now wish me well
Tell 'em kiss my ass, call it kiss and tell

[Verse 3: Cory Gunz]
Word to my mama, I'm out of my lima bean
Don't wanna see what that drama mean
Get some Dramamine
Llama scream, hotter than summer sun on a Ghana queen
Now all I want is hits, bitch, Wayne signed a fiend
I played the side for you niggas that's tryna front, and see
Son of Gun, Son of Sam, you nigga's the son of me
Pause for this dumber speech, I glow like Buddha
Disturb me, and you'll be all over the flo' like Luda
Bitch, I flow like scuba, bitch, I'm bold like Cuba
And I keep a killer ho, she gon' blow right through ya
I be mackin', 'bout my stackin', now I pack like a mover
Shout to ratchet for backin' out on behalf of my shooter
Niggas think they high as I, I come laugh at your ruler
Cash Money cold, bitch, but our actions is cooler
Wayne, these niggas out they mind
I done told these fuck niggas so many times
That I keep them bucks steady on my mind
Tuck these, I fuck these on your mind, pause
To feed them, on my grind, did I get a little love
Keep throwin' my sign in the middle
Hit 'em up, piece on my side
'Cause ain't no peace on my side, bitch
I'm a man, I visit urinals abroad
Tune told me to, I'm shootin' when the funeral outside
I'm uptown, thoroughbred, a BX nigga, ya heard? Gunna

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
Uh, AK on my nightstand, right next to that Bible
But I swear with these fifty shots, I'll shoot it out with 5-0
Pockets gettin' too fat, no Weight Watchers, no lipo
Money talks, bullshit walks on a motherfucking tightrope
And I make that pussy tap out, I knock that pussy out cold
Nigga you get beat the crap out, but that's just how the dice roll
These hoes want that hose pipe, so I give all these hoes pipe
She get on that dick and stay on, all night, like porch lights
Let's do it, fuck talkin', we out here, we ballin'
And I'm spraying at these rusty niggas like WD-40
We fucked up, we Truk'd up; no if, ands, or butt-fucks
Bitch niggas go behind ya back like nunchucks and that's fucked up
But my hoes down, my cups up, my niggas down for whatever
These bitches think they're too fly, well, tell them hoes I pluck feathers
I'm Tunechi, Young Tunechi, I wear Trukfit, fuck Gucci
She's blowing kisses at me with her pussy lips, smooches
And that's 2 Chainz

[Chorus: 2 Chainz & Lil Wayne]
Look at you, now look at us...
All my niggas look rich as fuck
All my niggas live rich as fuck
All my niggas look rich as fuck!
Look at you, now look at us...
All my niggas look rich as fuck
All my niggas live rich as fuck
All my niggas look rich as fuck!

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
Never talk to the cops, I don't speak Pig Latin
I turnt a penny to a motherfuckin Janet Jackson
Tell the bitches that be hatin' I ain't got no worries
I just want to hit and run like I ain't got insurance
Ho, what's your name? What's your sign? Zodiac Killer
All rats gotta die, even Master Splinter
Yeah, murder, 187
I be killing them bitches, I hope all dogs go to heaven
And I got Xanax, Percocet, Promethazine with Codeine
Call me Mr. Sandman, I'm sellin' all these hoes dreams
Got a white girl with big titties, flat-ass TV screen
I keep a bad bitch, call me the B.B. King
And you know I got that mouth out her
Then put that bitch out like a house fire
I'm killing these hoes like Michael Myers
I eat that cat just like a lion
And I can't trust none of these niggas
Can't trust none of these hoes
And I see your girl when I want, I got that ho TiVo'd
Got a red-ass bitch with a red-ass pussy
Nigga try me, that's a dead-ass pussy
Since y'all motherfuckers so blind to the fact
To tell you the truth, I don't care who's lookin'
All I know is I love my bitch, that pussy feel just like heaven on earth
Six feet deep, dick shovelin' the dirt, RIP ' Rest In Pussy
Light that shit, then pass that shit, we gon get so smoked out
And then I went got locked up, every night I dreamt I broke out
One time for them pussy niggas, that's that shit I don't like
We eatin' over here nigga, fuck around and have a food fight
And that's 2 Chainz

[Chorus: 2 Chainz & Lil Wayne]
Look at you, now look at us...
All my niggas look rich as fuck
All my niggas live rich as fuck
All my niggas look rich as fuck!
Look at you, now look at us...
All my niggas look rich as fuck
All my niggas live rich as fuck
All my niggas look rich as fuck!

[Outro: Lil Wayne]
And your nigga a ho

[Intro: Lil Wayne]
Uh, with everything happening today
You don't know whether you're coming or going, but
You think that you're on your way
Life lined up on the mirror, don't blow it

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
Woah, look at me when I'm talking to you
You looking at me but I'm looking through you
I see the blood in your eyes
I see the love in disguise
I see the pain hidden in your pride
I see you're not satisfied
And I don't see nobody else
I see myself, I'm looking at the..

[Chorus: Bruno Mars & Lil Wayne]
Mirror on the wall (Woah)
Here we are again (Yeah)
Through my rise and fall (Uh)
You've been my only friend (Yeah)
You told me that they can
Understand the man I am
So why are we here
Talking to each other again?

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
Uh, I see the truth in your lies
I see nobody by your side
But I'm with you when you're all alone
And you correct me when I'm looking wrong
I see the guilt beneath the shame
I see your soul through your window pane
I see the scars that remain
I see Wayne, I'm lookin' at the..

[Chorus: Bruno Mars & Lil Wayne]
Mirror on the wall
Here we are again (Yeah)
Through my rise and fall (Uh-huh)
You've been my only friend (My only friend)
You told me that they can
Understand the man I am (They can't understand)
So why are we here (Misunderstood)
Talking to each other again? (Woah)

[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]
Looking at me now I can see my past
Damn, I look just like my fucking dad
Light it up, that's smoke and mirrors
I even look good in a broken mirror
I see my mama smile, that's a blessing
I see the change, I see the message
And no message coulda been any clearer
So I'm starting with the man in the...

[Chorus: Bruno Mars & Lil Wayne]
Mirror on the wall (MJ taught me that)
Here we are again
Through my rise and fall (Uh)
You've been my only friend (Take 'em to Mars, man)
You told me that they can
Understand the man I am
So why are we
Talking to each other again? (Uh)
Mirror on the wall (Woah)
Here we are again (Yeah)
Through my rise and fall
You've been my only friend (Any questions?)
You told me that they can (I come to you)
Understand the man I am (You always have the answer)
So why are we here
Talking to each other again?

[Outro: Bruno Mars & Lil Wayne]
Mirror on the wall
Hey B.P, looks like I did take 'em to Mars this time
So why are we
Talking to each other again?

[Intro: Lil Wayne]
Young Money!
Yeah
Four
Ahem!

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
I tell her, "Now go and pop that pussy for a real nigga!"
I already know that life is deep, but I still dig her
Niggas is jealous, but really I could care less
I'm in Hell's Kitchen with an apron and a hairnet
Devil on my shoulder, the Lord as my witness
So on my Libra scale I'm weighin' sins and forgiveness
What goes around comes around like a hula hoop
Karma is a bitch? Well, just make sure that bitch is beautiful
Life on the edge, I'm danglin' my feet
I tried to pay attention but attention paid me
Haters can't see me: nose-bleed seats
And today I went shoppin' and talk is still cheap
I rock to the beat of my drum set
I been at the top for a while and I ain't jump yet
But I'm Ray Charles to the bullshit
Now jump up on that dick and do a full split!

[Hook: Drake]
Uh, she just started to pop it for a nigga
And looked back and told me, "Baby, it's real."
And I say, "I ain't doubt you for a second."
I squeeze it and I could tell how it feel
I wish we could take off and go anywhere but here
Baby, you know the deal
And she bad, so maybe she won't, ugh
But shit, then again, maybe she will, yeah
Do it for the realest niggas in the fuckin' game right now
She will, yeah
Do it for the realest niggas in the fuckin' game right now
She will, she will, she will, ugh
Maybe for the money and the power and the fame right now
She will, she will, she will (Ugh)
Do it for the realest niggas in the fuckin' game right now
She will

[Interlude: Lil Wayne]
Yeah

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
I tell her, "Now go and pop that pussy for me!"
Haters can't see me, but them bitches still lookin' for me
And you could take it to the bank and deposit that
Put your two cents in and get a dollar back
Some people hang you out to dry like a towel rack
I'm all about I, give the rest of the vowels back
I like my girl thick, not just kinda fine
Eat her 'til she cry'call that "wine 'n' dine"
Try to check me and I'ma have 'em checkin' pulses
They say, "Choose wisely," that's why I was chosen
Rockin' like asphalt, it's the cash fault
Looked in the face of Death and took its mask off
Now, I like my house big and my grass soft
I like my girl face south and her ass north
But I'm Ray Charles to the bullshit
Now hop up on that dick and do a full split!

[Hook: Drake]
Uh, she just started to pop it for a nigga
And looked back and told me, "Baby, it's real."
And I say, "I ain't doubt you for a second."
I squeeze it and I could tell how it feel
I wish we could take off
And go anywhere but here, baby, you know the deal
'Cause she bad so maybe she won't
Uh, but shit, then again, maybe she will
Do it for the realest niggas
In the fuckin' game right now, she will
Do it for the realest niggas
In the fuckin' game right now, she will
Maybe for the money and the power
And the fame right now, she will
Do it for the realest niggas
In the fuckin' game right now, she will

[Intro]
Bangladesh
Young Money!
You dig?
Mack, I'm going in

[Verse 1]
A millionaire, I'm a Young Money millionaire
Tougher than Nigerian hair
My criteria compared to your career just isn't fair
I'm a venereal disease, like a menstrual bleed
Through the pencil, and leak on the sheet of the tablet in my mind
'Cause I don't write shit, 'cause I ain't got time
'Cause my seconds, minutes, hours go to the almighty dollar
And the almighty power of that ch-cha-cha-chopper
Sister, brother, son, daughter, father; mother-fuck a copper
Got the Maserati dancin' on the bridge, pussy poppin'
Tell the coppers: "Ha-ha-ha-ha
You can't catch him, you can't stop him"
I go by them goon rules: if you can't beat 'em, then you pop 'em
You can't man 'em, then you mop 'em
You can't stand 'em, then you drop 'em
You pop 'em 'cause we pop 'em like Orville Redenbacher

[Chorus]
Motherfucker, I'm ill

[Verse 2]
A million here, a million there
Sicilian bitch with long hair, with coke in her derriere
Like smoking the thinnest air
I open the Lamborghini, hopin' them crackers see me
Like, "Look at that bastard Weezy!"
He's a beast, he's a dog, he's a mothafuckin' problem
Okay, you're a goon, but what's a goon to a goblin?
Nothin', nothin', you ain't scarin' nothin'
On some faggot bullshit: call 'em Dennis Rodman
Call me what you want, bitch! Call me on my Sidekick!
Never answer when it's private, damn, I hate a shy bitch
Don't you hate a shy bitch? Yeah, I ate a shy bitch
She ain't shy no more, she changed her name to My Bitch
Yeah, nigga, that's my bitch, so when she ask
For the money when you through, don't be surprised, bitch!
And it ain't trickin' if you got it
But you like a bitch with no ass: You ain't got shit
Motherfucker, I'm ill, not sick
And I'm okay, but my watch sick, yeah, my drop sick
Yeah, my Glock sick, and my knot thick ' I'm it

[Chorus]
Motherfucker, I'm ill

[Verse 3]
See, they say I'm rappin' like B.I.G., Jay, and 2Pac
Andr' 3000, where is Erykah Badu at? Who that?
Who that said they gon' beat Lil Wayne?
My name ain't Bic, but I keep that flame, man
Who that one that do that, boy?
You knew that true that, swallow
And I be the shit, now you got loose bowels
I don't owe you like two vowels
But I would like for you to pay me by the hour
And I'd rather be pushin' flowers
Than to be in the pen sharin' showers
Tony told us this world was ours
And the Bible told us every girl was sour
Don't play in her garden and don't smell her flower
Call me Mr. Carter or Mr. Lawn Mower
Boy, I got so many bitches, like I'm Mike Lowrey
Even Gwen Stefani said she couldn't doubt me
Motherfucker, I say "Life ain't shit without me"
Chrome lips pokin' out the coupe, look like it's poutin'
I do what I do, and you do what you can do about it
Bitch, I can turn a crack rock into a mountain ' dare me
Don't you compare me, 'cause there ain't nobody near me
They don't see me but they hear me
They don't feel me but they fear me
I'm illy, C3, 3 Peat

[Intro: Lil Wayne]
Yeah
C5

[Chorus: XXXTENTACION]
Don't cry, don't go
Won't lie, I fuckin' love you, whoa!

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
Why y'all staring into the clouds
Am I rising or they comin' down?
I see death around the corner
And the U-turn sign's lookin' like a smile
What do I do now? Who gon' find me, how?
Nowhere to turn but around and round
Just another nigga that done lost his head
No, a fucking king that forgot his crown
I am not number one, it's true
I'm number 9-27-82
Color blind even if I may be blue
A lot on my plate, ain't my favorite food
But I'm hungry, so hungry
Need my family tree next to a money tree
With a bunch of leaves in the Garden of Eden
With a bunch of Eves, no fruit punch for me
I sip from the Fountain of Youth
So if I die young, blame the juice
Bury me in New Orleans
Tombstone reads: "Don't cry, stay tuned."
Bring me back to life
Got to lose a life just to have a life
But if heaven's as good as advertised
I want a triple extension on my motherfuckin' afterlife
Rest in paradise

[Chorus: XXXTENTACION & Lil Wayne]
Don't cry (Don't cry, don't cry), don't go (Why, oh why?)
Won't lie, I fuckin' love you, whoa!
Don't cry (Don't cry, don't cry, don't cry)
Don't go (Why, oh why, oh why, oh why?)
Won't lie (Don't cry, don't cry)
I fuckin' love you, whoa! (Don't cry, don't cry)

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
Talent is God-given, be grateful
Fame is not a given, be humble
And conceit is self-driven, drive carefully
Stay in your own lane, seat buckled
And sometimes when there is no music
We toot our own horns, rum-bum-bum-bum
That woman carried the future
And Tunechi was born like, "dun-dun-dun-dun-dun"
Don't call it a comeback
It was dark, now the sun back
Hit me hard, but I punched back
The wheels fell off, I rode the hubcap
Is it suicide or it's do or die?
It's newer days and it's bluer skies
I told myself, "It's just you and I"
Then the breeze came and it blew my mind
Lord knows who I'm there for
I give my last breath of air for
Mama tell me to be careful
Voice in my head give me an earful
But I got mind control over my control
I lost control but knew I'd find control
I let God control what I cannot control
Can't control the tears, let 'em drop and roll

[Chorus: XXXTENTACION & Lil Wayne]
Don't cry (Don't cry, don't cry)
Don't go (Why, oh why, oh why?)
Won't lie (Don't cry), I fuckin' love you, whoa!
(Triple extension on my motherfuckin' afterlife, rest in paradise)
Don't cry (Don't cry, don't cry)
Don't go (Why, oh why, oh why?)
Won't lie, I fuckin' love you, whoa! (Don't cry)

[Outro: Lil Wayne]
Don't cry, stay tuned
And triple extension on my motherfuckin' afterlife
Rest in paradise

[Intro]
Yeah, I put my shades on

[Verse 1]
I live it up like these are my last days
If time is money, I'm an hour past paid
Ugh, gunpowder in my hourglass
Niggas faker than some flour in a powder bag
Yeah, I put it down like my hands hurting
I'm on a natural high, but I land perfect
Some of us are lovers, most of y'all haters
But I put up a wall, and they just wallpaper
So love or hate me, I stay hate-free
They say we learn from mistakes; why, that's why they mistake me
I got some weight on my shoulders, to me it's like feathers
All hail Weezy, call it bad weather
I stick to the script, I memorize the lines
Cause life is a movie that I've seen too many times
You're on the outside looking in, close the blinds
And they say never say never, but fuck it, nevermind
I've been gone too long, true or false, right or wrong
Hello Weezy, welcome home, yeah

[Chorus]
And I'm a blunt-blowin', Polo-drawers-showin'
I-don't-give-a-lovely-motherfuck-ass-nigga
With my money growing, no matter where you going
You don't need a bus pass for me to bust yo ass, nigga
I'm a blunt-blowin', Polo-drawers-showin'
I-don't-give-a-lovely-motherfuck-ass-nigga
With my money growing, no matter where you going
You don't need a bus pass for me to bust yo ass, nigga

[Verse 2]
Stunna, I got 'em, I'm back on them bitches
All about my riches, my name should be Richard
Cut the bullshit out, I'm Edward with the scissors
Life is a choice, and death is a decision
Times have changed, but fuck it get a new watch
I still got the vision like a line between two dots
Young Money's eating, the label getting fatter
And yea, the tables turned, but I'm still sitting at 'em
I'm a bad motherfucker cause the good die young
Everybody selling dreams, I'm too cheap to buy one
Man, when that cookie crumble, everybody want a crumb
Shoot that hummingbird down, hummingbird don't hum
Yea, big money, big money, deep pockets
Money talks, and motherfuckers eavesdropping
Bunch of bloods, you could call it blood clotting
Eastside, MOB Piru Damu

[Hook]
I'm a blunt-blowin', Polo-drawers-showin'
I-don't-give-a-lovely-motherfuck-ass-nigga
With my teeth glowing, I'm on my Deebowin'
You don't need a bus pass for me to bust yo ass, nigga

[Verse 3]
Light that Ashton Kutcher, I'm a limit pusher
See y'all dead meat, and me I'm just a butcher
I do it for the money, man I am such a hooker
And freedom was my girl, until they fucking took her
You can look into the future, it's right behind your eyelids
But I don't wanna know, cause shit I like surprises
Why that, why this, why you on that why shit?
Motherfucker ask me why, I say YM
Beach bum, call me Ocean Drive Slim
Drop the top, look up and make the sky grin
Young Mula, skinnies and some Supras
Belly of the beast 'til it puke us, motherfucker

[Hook]
I'm a blunt-blowin', Polo-drawers-showin'
I-don't-give-a-lovely-motherfuck-ass-nigga
With my money growing, no matter where you going
You don't need a bus pass for me to bust yo ass, nigga

[Outro]
I've been gone too long
True or false, right or wrong
Hello Weezy, welcome home
It's Young Mula, baby

[Chorus: Detail]
You can look me in my face
(I ain't got no worries)
(I ain't got no worries)
(I ain't got no worries)
See the sh-rooms keep me up

Yeah that's Mack Maine right there, and we ain't got no worries
You see pussy right there redbone mangos right there
See them sh-roomies right there we ain't got no worries

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
Tunechi in this bitch, e'rybody should be worried
Them pussy niggas be purring, bitches be diggin' me I feel buried
And if she make this dick hard, she woke up a sleeping giant
Man your bitch speak in tongues every time we speak in private
Hope your barber shop open cause we got hair triggers
Smoke so much that Smokey the Bear'll have to bear with us
And that Jeep with the doors off that means that bitch sleep
All these bitches think they're the shit, I'll send them up shit's creek
You see Tunechi right here, give me brain ideas
It's ok if you turn up just don't turn off my light years
All I know is I do it what I'm smoking I grew it
B's up, Blood Gang; Piru it, and all rats gotta die even Stuart
On my private jet and my stewardess is your bitch nigga, bitch Nigga
I know gold-diggers and ditch-diggers
You don't get dissed, you get disfigured
She say sorry I didn't shave so that pussy a little furry
I put that pussy in my face: I ain't got no worries
Tunechi

[Chorus: Detail]
You can look me in my face
(I ain't got no worries)
(I ain't got no worries)

Yeah that's Mack Maine right there, and we ain't got no worries
You see pussy right there, redbone mangos right there
See them sh-roomies right there, we ain't got no worries

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
We ain't got no worries
She bad as a hooker, so she ain't got no worries
She want me to eat her sugar, I say "Why you in a hurry?"
She say "Why you asking questions?" I say "Bitch you tryna be funny!"
Now take your fucking clothes off, let me see that Donkey Kong
I swing your ass back and forth, back and forth on my monkey bar
That camel toe, that camel toe, no worries no panty-hose
These niggas falling off like baggy clothes, I smoke more than a magic show
I swear I saw my ho, I swear she was with my ho
You know I fuck them both, sore pussy and sore throat
Bitch, it's Tunechi and I'm out chea, no worries no worries
I would talk about my dick, but man that shit be a long story
YEAHHH, OHH SHIT, I'M UP, YEAHH, YOUNG MULA BABY!

[Chorus: Detail]
You can look me in my face
(I ain't got no worries)
(I ain't got no worries)
(I ain't got no worries)

(Weezy, Weezy, Weezy, Weezy
Weezy, Weezy, Weezy, Weezy)
I see, thank you man, thank you
Y'all know his name
Ayo, Mack, let the beat drop
Ladies and gentlemen, C5, Wayne time
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Zone, zone, zone, zone, zone
Let me see your shoulders work
I mean, I don't know what y'all came here to do, but, uh
If you ain't got a lighter, what the fuck you smoking for?
We hot! (Haaa)

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
What the fuck, though? Where the love go?
Five, four, three, two, I let one go
Bow! Get the fuck though, I don't bluff, bro
Aimin' at your head like a buffalo
You a roughneck, I'm a cutthroat
You're a tough  guy, that's enough jokes
Then the sun die, the night is young though
The diamonds still shine in the rough, ho
What the fuck though? Where the love go?
Five, four, three, two, where the ones go?
It's a shit show, put you front row
Talkin' shit, bro? Let your tongue show
Money over bitches, and above hoes
That is still my favorite love quote
Put the gun inside, what the fuck for?
I sleep with the gun, and she don't snore
What the fuck, yo? Where the love go?
Trade the ski mask for the muzzle
It's a blood bath, where the suds go?
It's a Swizz beat, there the drums go
If she's iffy, there the drugs go
If she sip lean, double-cup toast
I got a duffle full of hundos
There the love go, where's the uproar?

[Chorus: Lil Wayne]
What the fuck though? Where the love go?
Five, four, three, two, I let one go
Bow! Get the fuck though, I don't bluff, bro
Aimin' at your head like a buffalo
What the fuck though? Where the love go?
Five, four, three, two, I let one go
Bow! Get the fuck though, I don't bluff, bro
Aimin' at your head like a buffalo

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
Get the fuck though, I don't bluff, bro
I come out the scuffle without a scuff, woah
Puff, puff, bro; I don't huff though
Yellow diamonds up close, catch a sunstroke
At your front door with a gun stowed
"Knock, knock. Who's there?" is how it won't go
This the jungle, so have the utmost
For the nutzos, and we nuts, so
What the fuck, bro? It's where I'm from, bro
We grow up fast, we roll up slow
We throw up gang signs, she throw up dope
Dreadlock hang down like you dun know
Put the green in the bag like a lawnmower
Hair trigger pulled back like a cornrow
Extra clip in the stash like a console
Listenin' to Bono, you listen to Donald
What the fuck, bro? Where the love go?
Swizzy, he the chef, I like my lunch gross
Just look up, bro, there the Scuds go
I see the shovel, but where did bruh go?
Hmm, to the unknown
Only way he comin' back is through his unborns
If you see what's in my bag, think I'm a drug lord
It's empty when I give it back, now where's the uproar?

[Chorus: Lil Wayne]
What the fuck though? Where the love go?
Five, four, three, two, I let one go
Bow! Get the fuck though, I don't bluff, bro
Aimin' at your head like a buffalo
What the fuck though? Where the love go?
Five, four, three, two, I let one go
Bow! Get the fuck though, I don't bluff, bro
Aimin' at your head like a buffalo

[Intro]
Kane is in the building

[Verse 1: Drake]
Who else is really trying to fuck with Hollywood Cole
I'm with Marley G's bro
Flying Holly Grove chicks to my Hollywood shows
And I wanna tell you something that you probably should know
This that Slum Dog Millionaire Bollywood flow and uh
My real friends never hearing from me
Fake friends write the wrong answers on the mirror for me
That's why I pick and choose, I don't get shit confused
I got a small circle, I'm not with different crews
We walk the same path, but got on different shoes
Live in the same building, but we got different views
I got a couple cars, I never get to use
Don't like my women single, I like my chicks in twos
And these days all the girls are down to roll
I hit the strip club, and all them bitches find a pole
Plus I be sipping, so this shit is moving kinda slow
Just tell my girl to tell her friend that it's time to go

[Hook: Lil Wayne]
Now tell me how you love it
You know you at the top when only heaven is right above it
We on, it's Young Money motherfucker
If you ain't running with it, run from it motherfucker
Alright, now somebody show some money in this bitch
And I got my b's with me like some honey in this bitch, you dig
I got my gun in my boo purse
And I don't bust back, because I shoot first

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
Meet me on the fresh train, yes I'm in the building
You just on the list of guest names
And all of my riders do not give a fuck, X-Games
Guns turn you boys into pussies, sex change
And I smoke 'til I got chest pains
And you niggas know I rep my gang like Jesse James
Women are possessive, and they wanna possess Wayne
I been fly so long I fell asleep on the fucking plane
Skinny pants and some Vans
Call me Triple A, get my advance in advance, amen
As the world spinning, dance in my hands
Life is a beach, I'm just playing in the sand
Uh, wake up and smell the pussy
You niggas can't see me, but never overlook me
I'm on a paper trail and ain't no telling where it took me
Yeah, and I ain't a killer but don't push me

[Hook: Lil Wayne]
Now tell me how you love it
You know you at the top when only heaven is right above it
We on, it's Young Money motherfucker
If you ain't running with it, run from it motherfucker
Alright, now somebody show some money in this bitch
And I got my b's with me like some honey in this bitch, you dig
I got my gun in my boo purse
And I don't bust back, because I shoot first

[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]
How do you say what's never said?
Beautiful black woman, I bet that bitch look better red
Limping off tour, cause I made more on my second leg
Muthafuckin' Birdman Jr., 11th Grade
Ball on automatic start
I can hand it to Drake or do a quarterback draw
Wildcat offense, check the paw prints
We in the building, you niggas in apartments
Uh, now come on be my blood donor
Flow so nice you ain't gotta put a rug on her
Do it big and let the small fall under that
Damn where you stumbled at? From where they make Gumbo at
Kane got the fucking beat jumping like a jumping jack
And you know me, I get on this bitch and have a heart attack
Hip-Hop, I'm the heart of that
Nigga, nothing short of that
President Carter, Young Money Democrat

[Hook: Lil Wayne]
Now tell me how you love it
You know you at the top when only heaven is right above it
We on, it's Young Money motherfucker
If you ain't running with it, run from it motherfucker
Alright, now somebody show some money in this bitch
And I got my b's with me like some honey in this bitch, you dig
I got my gun in my boo purse
And I don't bust back, because I shoot first

[Produced by Chase N. Cashe & Hit-Boy]

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
I got ice in my veins, blood in my eyes
Hate in my heart, love in my mind
I seen nights full of pain, days are the same
You keep the sunshine, save me the rain
I search but never find, hurt but never cry
I work and forever try, but I'm cursed, so never mind
And it's worse, but better times seem further and beyond
The top gets higher the more that I climb
The spot gets smaller and I get bigger
Tryin' to get in where I fit in, no room for a nigga
But soon for a nigga it be on, motherfucker
'Cause all this bullshit done made me strong, motherfucker

[Hook: Lil Wayne]
So I pick the world up
And I'ma drop it on your fuckin' head
Bitch, I'ma pick the world up
And I'ma drop it on your fuckin' head
And I could die now, rebirth, motherfucker
Hop up in my spaceship and leave Earth, motherfucker
I'm gone, motherfucker, I'm gone

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
I know what they don't wanna tell you
Just hope you're heaven-sent, and you're hell-proof
I walk up in the world and cut the lights off
And confidence is a stain they can't wipe off
My word is my pride
But wisdom is bleak, and that's a word from the wise
Served to survive, murdered and bribed
And when it got too heavy I put my burdens aside

[Hook: Lil Wayne]
So I can pick the world up
And I'ma drop it on your fuckin' head
Bitch, I'ma pick the world up
And I'ma drop it on your fuckin' head
And I could die now, rebirth, motherfucker
Hop up in my spaceship and leave Earth, motherfucker
I'm gone, motherfucker, I'm gone

[Bridge: Eminem]
It hurts, but I never show
This pain you'll never know
If only you could see just how lonely and how cold
And frostbit I've become
My back's against the wall
When push come to shove
I just stand up and scream: "Fuck 'em all!"

[Verse 3: Eminem]
Man, it feels like these walls are closin' in
This roof is cavin' in, up it's time to raise it, then
Your days are numbered like pages in
My book of rhymes; got 'em cookin', boy
This crooked mind of mines got 'em all shook
And scared to look in my eyes
I stole that fuckin' clock: I took the time
And I came up from behind and pretty much snuck up
And butt-fucked this game up
Better be careful when you bring my name up
Fuck this fame, that ain't what I came to claim
But the game ain't gonna be the same on the day that I leave it
But I swear, one way or another
I'ma make these fuckin' haters believe it
I swear to God, won't spare the rod
I'm a man of my words, so your fuckin' heads better nod
Or I'ma fuck around in this bitch and roast everybody
Sleep on me, that pillow is where your head'll lie
Permanently, bitch, it's beddy-bye
This world is my Easter egg, yeah, prepare to die!
My head is swole
My confidence is up, this stage is my pedestal
I'm unstoppable, Incredible Hulk
You're trapped in my medicine ball
I could run circles around you so fast your fuckin' head'll spin, dog
I'll split your cabbage and your lettuce and olives, I'll fuckin''

[Hook: Lil Wayne]
Pick the world up and I'ma drop it on your fuckin' head
Bitch, I'ma pick the world up
And I'ma drop it on your fuckin' head
And I could die now, rebirth, motherfucker
Hop up in my spaceship and leave Earth, motherfucker
I'm gone, motherfucker, I'm gone

[Intro]
Just saw an alien saucer approaching from the sky
Radio contact has been attempted but cannot be established Instructions are to prepare for an attack by an unknown enemy

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
Fo' fo' bulldog: my motherfucking pet
I point it at you and tell that motherfucker "fetch"
I'm fucking her good, she got her legs on my neck
I get pussy, mouth and ass, call that bitch triple threat
When I was in jail she let me call her collect
But if she get greedy, I'ma starve her to death
Top down, it's upset
Been fucking the world and nigga I ain't cum yet
You fuck with me wrong, I knock your head off your neck
The flight too long, I got a bed on the jet
The guns are drawn and I ain't talking 'bout a sketch
I pay these niggas with a reality check
Prepared for the worst but still praying for the best
This game is a bitch I got my hand up her dress
The money don't sleep, so Weezy can't rest
And AK-47 is my fucking address, huh

[Chorus: Rick Ross & Lil Wayne]
I'm not a star, somebody lied, I got a chopper in the car
I got a chopper in the car, I got a chopper in the car
Load up the choppers like it's December 31st
Roll up and cock it and hit them niggas where it hurts
If I die today, remember me like John Lennon
Buried in Louis, I'm talking all brown linen, huh

[Verse 2: Rick Ross]
Big black nigga in a icey watch
Shoes on the coupe, bitch I got a Nike shop
Count the profits you could bring 'em in a Nike box
Grinding in my Jordans kick 'em off they might be hot, swish!
I'm swimming in a yellow bitch in the red 911 looking devilish
Red beam make a bitch nigga sit down
Thought it were bullet proof till he got hit the fifth time
Drop palmolive in a nigga dope
Make it come back even harder than before
Baby I'm the only one that paid your car notes
Well connected got killers off in Chicago

[Chorus: Rick Ross & Lil Wayne]
I'm not a star, somebody lied, I got a chopper in the car
I got a chopper in the car, I got a chopper in the car
Load up the choppers like it's December 31st
Roll up and cock it and hit them niggas where it hurts
If I die today, remember me like John Lennon
Buried in Louis, I'm talking all brown linen, huh

[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]
Talk stupid, get ya head popped
I got that Esther, bitch I'm Redd Foxx
Big B's, Red Sox, I get money to kill time, dead clocks
You fucking with a nigga who won't give a fuck
Empty the clip then roll the window up
Pussy nigga sweet, them niggas Cinnabon
I'm in a red bitch, she said she finna cum
200 thou' on a chain, I don't need a piece
That banana clip, let Chiquita speak
Dark shades, Eazy E, five letters, YMCMB
Bitch ass nigga, pussy ass nigga
I see ya looking, with ya looking ass nigga
You know the rules, kill them all and keep moving
If I died today it'd be a holiday

[Verse 4: Rick Ross]
I'm not a star, somebody lied
I got a chopper in the car, so don't make it come alive
Rip yo ass apart then I pull myself together
YMCMB, double M, we rich forever
The bigger the bullet the more that bitch gon' bang
Red on the wall, Basquiat when I paint
Red Lamborghini till I gave it to my bitch
My first home invasion, papi gave me 40 bricks
Son of a bitch, then I made a great escape
Ain't it funny mom her only son be baking cakes
Pull up in the sleigh, hop out like I'm Santa Claus
Niggas gather round, got gifts for each and all of y'all
Take it home and let it bubble that's the double up
If you get in trouble that just mean you fucking up
It's a cold World I need a bird to cuddle up
I call the plays, motherfucker huddle up

[Outro: Lil Wayne]
I'm not a star, somebody lied, I got a chopper in the car, yeah

[Intro: Lil Wayne]
Cut the music up
A little louder

[Chorus: Lil Wayne]
You had a lot of crooks trying to steal your heart
Never really had luck, couldn't never figure out
How to love, how to love
You had a lot of moments that didn't last forever
Now you in a corner trying put it together
How to love, how to love
For a second you were here, now you over there
It's hard not to stare the way you're moving your body
Like you never had a love, never had a love

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
When you was just a young'un, your looks were so precious
But now you're grown up, so fly it's like a blessing
But you can't have a man look at you for five seconds
Without you being insecure
You never credit yourself, so when you got older
It seems like you came back ten times over
Now you're sitting here in this damn corner
Looking through all your thoughts and looking over your shoulder

[Chorus: Lil Wayne]
See you had a lot of crooks trying to steal your heart
Never really had luck, couldn't never figure out
How to love, how to love
You had a lot of moments that didn't last forever
Now you in a corner tryning put it together
How to love, how to love
For a second you were here, now you over there
It's hard not to stare the way you're moving your body
Like you never had a love, never had a love

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
You had a lot of dreams that transform to visions
The fact that you saw the world affected all your decisions
But it wasn't your fault, wasn't in your intentions
To be the one here talking to me, be the one listening
But I admire your poppin' bottles and dippin'
Just as much as you admire bartending and stripping
Baby, so don't be mad, nobody else trippin'
You see a lot of crooks and crooks still crook

[Chorus: Lil Wayne]
You had a lot of crooks trying to steal your heart
Never really had luck, couldn't never figure out
How to love, how to love
You had a lot of moments that didn't last forever
Now you in this corner tryna put it together
How to love, how to love
For a second you were here, now you over there
It's hard not to stare the way you're moving your body
Like you never had a love, never had a love

[Bridge: Lil Wayne]
See I just want you to know that you deserve the best
You're beautiful, you're beautiful
Yeah, and I want you to know
You're far from the usual, far from the usual

[Chorus: Lil Wayne]
You see you had a lot of crooks trying to steal your heart
Never really had luck, couldn't never figure out
How to love, how to love
See you had a lot of moments that didn't last forever
Now you in this corner trying put it together
How to love, how to love
See you had a lot of crooks trying to steal your heart
Never really had luck, couldn't never figure out
How to love, how to love
You had a lot of moments that didn't last forever
Now you in this corner trying put it together
How to love, how to love

[Intro: Lil Wayne & 2 Chainz]
If it wasn't for Wayne, it wouldn't be
You tatted your face
Bugatti, new boo
You screamed, "Suu whoop"
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
You bought a Bugatti, so you can flex
Most of the bad bitches your ex

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
Tattoos, suu whoop, Bugatti, new boo
New subject, new paper, new class, new school
New buddies, new haters, new ass, new boobs
Much later, too soon, too bad, too cool
Too hot, too lit, too high to move
Two eyes to view but too blind to bloom
Who lied to you?
Two middle fingers that's up high to whom
It may consume, kaboom, goddamn
Who knew that I am the guru with voodoo
That sued you to high hell
With shooters that shoot through the iron, man
And see through the con man and now he a dyin' man
I turned a goddamn into a God's Plan
Go over the diagram and get to the job, man
Watch for the spy cam
Sit back and watch and do not watch your watch hand
Give me some time, man
I am the bomb, man
I am gon' swim 'til I come out on dry land or on the fryin' pan
No, we did not land on Plymouth Rock
But it landed on our land, now I'm just buyin' land
Back to the block where they got more rock fans
Than a fuckin' rock band under a rock, man
We need Barack, man, I do what I can
To keep it solid as a you know what I'm sayin'
With some rock playin'

[Chorus: 2 Chainz & Lil Wayne]
You tatted your face and changed the culture (You changed)
You screamed, "Suu whoop," and them gangsters loved you (Yeah, yeah)
You bought a Bugatti so you could flex (So you can flex)
And most of the bad bitches your ex

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
I started this shit, you just part of this shit
I'm the heart of this shit, and the heart doesn't skip
Take the heart of yo' bitch, 'cause like Bart, you a simp
And your water don't drip so your garden ain't shit
You just countin' the money, I'm drownin' in money
Like, "Where the fuck is the lifeguard in this bitch?"
I go Mars in this bitch, watch me orbit and shit
For the art of this shit, Andy Warhol and shit
Go retarded as shit, you go sweet tangy
I go tart on this shit, I'ma barf on this shit
I'm a martian and shit, you an orphan, lil' bitch
If I taught you some shit, that's like Harvard, lil' bitch
You ain't talkin' 'bout shit but you softer than shit
Walk it like you talk it, now you walkin' in shit
I go Marvel movie on some marvelous shit
In the spotlight too long, should be darker than this
This is Tha Carter, lil' bitch

[Chorus: 2 Chainz & Lil Wayne]
You tatted your face and changed the culture (You changed)
You screamed, "Suu whoop," and them gangsters loved you (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
You bought a Bugatti so you could flex (So you can flex)
And most of the bad bitches your ex

[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]
I started this shit, they borrowed this shit
I thought of this shit, they thought it was it
I'm doggin' this shit, they bark and they sit
Put a fork in that shit, which drawer to look in?
I brought in this shit, the starters get benched
The orders get sent, then targets get hit
Billion dollar smile
I sell myself short if I grin, I'm bargainin' then
Apartments and shit, I could park in this shit
In the foreign car that I could talk to and shit
With a cultural bitch I can talk to and shit
'Bout the culture and shit, how I altered this shit

[Refrain: Lil Wayne]
Tattoos, suu whoop, Bugatti, new boo
Tattoos, suu whoop, Bugatti, new boo
Tattoos, suu whoop, Bugatti, new boo
All of that shit, just tha Carter lil' bitch

[Outro: Lil Wayne, 2 Chainz & Barack Obama]
You changed, suu whoop (You tatted your face)
Bugatti, new boo (You screamed, "Suu whoop")
Tattoos, suu whoop, Bugatti, new boo
Tattoos, suu whoop, Bugatti, new boo
Tunechi
(If it wasn't for Wayne, it wouldn't be)
They might think they've got a pretty good jump shot, or a pretty good flow. But our kids can't all aspire to be LeBron or Lil Wayne!

[Intro: Lil Wayne]
Yo, yo Drew and Inf
This-this, this right here is crazy
Yo I, I feel big, you know what I mean?
Like, not, not big in the sense of, weight
You know what I mean? Like gainin' weight or nothin' like that
Like colossal
Like, you know what I mean, like (sighs)
I heard you were lookin' for me

[Chorus: Sha-Ron Prescott & Lil Wayne]
Hey, Mr. Carter (Hello)
Tell me, where have you been? (Haha, you know, hehe)
Cause they've been asking, they've been searching
They've been wondering why (I know, haha)
Hey, Mr. Carter (Hey, hello)
Tell me, where have you been? (Shit, you know)
Cause they've been asking, they've been searching
They've been wondering why (Hahahah)

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
Yeah, to you forever, from me to you
I heard somebody say "Church", I'ma need a suit
I'ma need a coupe, I won't need a roof
Flyer than Beetlejuice, Beetlejuice, Beetlejuice
I got the flow, I'm tryin' to see the roof
Didn't wear a bulletproof so I got shot and you can see the proof
Blind eyes could look at me and see the truth
Wonder if Stevie do?
But I'ma leave it to God, not Beaver, neither you
Cause I'ma murder Y, kill O, and even U
Man, I got Summer hatin' on me cause I'm hotter than the sun
Got Spring hatin' on me 'cause I ain't never sprung
Winter hatin' on me 'cause I'm colder than y'all
And I will never, I will never, I will never Fall
I'm being hated by the seasons
So fuck y'all who hatin' for no reason

[Chorus: Sha-Ron Prescott & Lil Wayne]
Hey, Mr. Carter (I am him!)
Tell me, where have you been?
Around the world and I'm back again!
Cause they've been asking, they've been searching
Who's been askin' about me?
They've been wondering why (In case you wonderin', hah!)
Hey, Mr. Carter (I am him!)
Tell me, where have you been?
Around the world now I'm back again!
Cause they've been asking, they've been searching
Who's been askin' about me?
They've been wondering why (In case you wonderin', hah!)

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
Yeah, I been in and out the bank, bitch
While y'all asshole niggas been on the same shit
I flush and watch 'em go down the drain quick
Two words you never hear: "Wayne quit!?"
Cause Wayne win, and they lose
I call 'em April babies, cause they fools
And when they snooze, we up!
Feet up, like a paraplegia
Or paraplegic? I parallel park
In that red-and-yellow thing; old school Atlanta Hawk
Like I'm from College Park, but I'm from Hollygrove
Now all my Bloods scream "Soo-woo" and "Da-da-doe"
I know my role and I play it well
And I weigh it well, on my Libra scale
I suck a pussy, fuck a pussy, leave it there
Long hair, don't even care

[Chorus: Sha-ron Prescott & Jay-Z]
Hey, Mr. Carter (Young! I am him)
Tell me, where have you been?
Around the world now I'm back again
Cause they've been asking, they've been searching
Who's been askin' about me?
They've been wondering why (In case you wonderin')
Hey, Mr. Carter (I am him)
Tell me, where have you been?
Around the world now I'm back again
Cause they've been asking, they've been searching
Who's been askin' about me?
They've been wondering why (In case you wonderin', chyeah)

[Verse 3: Jay-Z]
I'm right here in my chair with my crown and my dear
Queen B, as I share, mic time with my heir
Young Carter, go farther, go further, go harder
Is that not why we came? And if not, then why bother?
Show no mercy in Murcielagos
I'm far from bein' the bastard that Marcy had fathered
Now my name's been mentioned with the martyrs
The Biggies and the Pacs and the Marleys and the Marcuses
Garvey; got me a molotov-cocktail flow
Even if you box well, can't stop the blows
Kaboom! The Roc Boy in the room
The dope boy I just came off the spoon
Also, I'm so fly I'm on auto-
Pilot, while guys just stare at my wardrobe
I see Euros, that's right: plural
I took so much change from this rap game, it's your go
(Hey Mr. Carter) Young!

[Verse 4: Lil Wayne]
It's my go, yeah' And I'ma go so opposite of soft
Off the richter, Hector, Camacho Man, Randy Savage
Far from average, above status'quo, flow so pro
I know, I ride slow, and when I pass
They say, "What up, killa?" Man, stop bringin' up my past
And next time you mention Pac, Biggie, or Jay-Z
Don't forget Weezy, Baby!

[Chorus: Sha-Ron Prescott, Lil Wayne & Choir]
Hey, Mr. Carter (Amen)
Tell me, where have you been? (Yeah)
Cause they've been asking, they've been searching
They've been wondering why (Haha)
Hey, Mr. Carter (Amen)
Tell me, where have you been? (Hova!)
Cause they've been asking, they've been searching (Weezy)
They've been wondering why (Baby!)
Hey, Mr. Carter (Hahaha)
Tell me, where have you been? (I been hustlin')
Cause they've been asking, they've been searching (Hustlin' hard)
They've been wondering why (Chyeah!)
Hey, Mr. Carter
Tell me, where have you been?
Cause they've been asking, they've been searching
They've been wondering why

[Outro: Lil Wayne]
And I swear to everything, when I leave this Earth
It's gonna be on both feet, never knees in the dirt
And you can try me, fucker, but when I squeeze, it hurt
Fine, we'll lose two lives; yours and mine
Give me any amount of time, don't let Ms. Carter grieve
At the funeral parlor, drippin' tears down my sleeve
Give me any amount of time, don't let Ms. Carter grieve

[Intro]
Pump that bass

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
Man, fuck ya'll with a sick dick, semi automatic, no click click
We don't feel you, like an elephant getting fucked with a tick dick
Little nigga with a thick bitch, and before I fuck this bitch
I gotta put that patch over my third eye: Slick Rick
Trukfit, T-shirt, talk second, skeet first
Boy, your girl a jump off, I hope she land feet first

Boy, I overgrind (whoa), overshine (whoa)
Ain't another nigga over Sean (boy, boy)

Weezy F, I'm east side, them haters 90 going west

Tunechi, Tunechi, Tunechi, I don't love them hoes
Got so much coke, you gon' need another nose
Man, I just play my hand, but I am not the dealer
You see I got them tear drops, I cry your ass a river
I got that Trukfit T-shirt, listening to Rebirth
I skate until my feet hurt, Hot Boy, free Turk
Pussy for dessert, put your ass beneath Earth
And I don't sell drugs, but if you need work

[Hook: Lil Wayne & Big Sean]
Yeah, my homies still
Haha, my homies still
Yeah, my homies still
Whoa, okay

[Verse 4: Big Sean & Lil Wayne]
Boy, this here's what I do do (do do)

Got me in control, no strings attached, that's that voodoo (go)
She said can't nobody do it better, I tell her, "True, true," yeah, bitch, true, true
My, my, my bro-bro say these bitches ain't shit (ain't shit)
I got the girl you came with and the girl she came with
She leaking and drippin', whoa, there I might just come slip in (whoa, whoa, whoa)
And your misses gonna go missin' if she addicted to what my dick did
Boy, I get it! (I get it)

And niggas pumping so much bass (pump that bass)
Yeah, uh-huh
Young Mula
Truk yo girl
(Pump that bass)

[Verse 1]
Uh, my mind's filled with mine fields
The ashes fall, the wine spills
The world stops, drops and rolls
It's Judgment Day or a fire drill
Yea, I pour out my heart, have a drink
They say the drunk never lie, they ain't never lyin' yea
My country 'tis of thee
Sweet land of kill em all and let em die

[Hook]
God bless Amerika
This ole' godless Amerika
I heard tomorrow ain't promised today
The end of time is like a hour away

[Verse 2]
Damn, military minded, lost and can't find it
The stars on the flag are never shining
Uh, I saw a butterfly in hell today
Will I die or go to jail today?
Cause I live by the sword and die by the sword
Heard police was lookin' for me, I'mma hide by a broad
Shootin' stars in my pocket; bitch, sit on my rocket
I'm wired out the socket, but still shocking
Everybody wanna tell me what I need
You can play a role in my life but not the lead
If there's food for thought then I'm guilty of greed
Mama said take what you want ' I took heed yea
Now let it breathe, yea

[Verse 3]
Back to life, back to reality
Been eating my girl and she's so sweet, got cavities
Granted we do it for vanity not humanity
But what's appealing to me is under banana trees, love
I go so hard, I tried to pay homage but I was overcharged
Ain't that a bitch? I'm just a nut tryna bust a nut, in a nut shell
Used to say fuck the police, now I say fuck jail
Same shit, different air freshener
I don't play, boy, I ain't Hugh Hefner
Tryna be a step ahead, but a few feet behind
Two fingers to my head, pop! Peace of mind
I be in the cloud, cloud number 9
And I just fucked the clock and let it come to time
It's a cold world, I put on a mink
There's a chain of command, I'm the missing link

[Hook]
God bless Amerika
This ole' godless Amerika
I heard tomorrow ain't promised today
And I'm smoking on them flowers, catch the bouquet

[Outro]
Here we live by the sword and die by the sword
Heard police was lookin' for me, I'mma hide by a broad
Shootin' stars in my pocket; bitch, sit on my rocket
I'm wired out the socket, but still shockin'
Everybody wanna tell me what I need
You can play a role in my life but not the lead
I saw a butterfly in hell today
Will I die or go to jail today?

Fly (Fly, fly, fly, fly)

[Chorus: Travis Scott]
Let it fly (Let it fly, let it fly, let it fly)
Let it fly like the birds in the sky
Hotter than the weather in July

She just get so wet, I slip and slide
Had to get it back to give 'em five

[Verse 1: Travis Scott]
Yeah, it's Mr. Michael Myers, man (Michael Myers)
Word to the MoneyBagg, I keep it coming in (Woo, woo)
By the way we work you think I had a twin (Twin)
I'm tryna run the game, it ain't no subbing in (Naw)
You can't phase me, sliding from a dangerous life (It's lit!)
Always down to ball, I'm tryna drain these nights
See the smoke clouds through the entertainment lights
The way it go down we taking fours and keeping doors tight (Yeah, yeah!)
We at the top, end of discussion (Discussion)
They mixing alcohol and that 'tussin
The demon in they eyes and they clutchin' (Scared)
I feed 'em Adderall and they bussin', yeah (Pew-pew-pew-pew-pew)
I kept the towel, not throwing in
I'm riding around in my ends
I got a driver for the Bent' to drive me 'round when I'm bent
I keep some pussy just to lick to help me out when I vent
She wanna hit that shit again, nah (Brr-brr, brr-brr)
That's the phone call, when my blood ring
It's Tha Carter V, let the thugs sing (Thugs)

[Chorus: Travis Scott]
Let it fly (Brr, fly)

It's alive, it's alive, I'm revived, it's C5
Been arrived, kiss the sky, did the time
Please advise, it is advised to be advised
And we advise you not fuck with me and mine
And keep in mind that we don't mind losing our minds
Free your mind, read your mind, read your mind
Body take a week to find, the cops gon' be like, "Never mind"
What's on your mind?
Put the pistol to your mind and blow your mind
Control your mind, mindfreak, no sober mind
I'm so behind, but front line
You crossed the line, and you better know your lines
And if you getting out of line, I hang you with a clothing line
Wring you like an open line, keep your stanky ho in line
Them hoes be lying, it's a thin line, and I know you know the line
Second line, second line, Tunechi got effective lines
Rough edges like a box of Checkers fries, that's a line
Catch the line, American flag, less stars, extra lines
Stretch the line, skip the line, 'til you no more next in line
Yeah, Tunechi-Tune a lunatic, my goonie-goons the gooniest
Run inside your room and kill you and who you roomin' with
The Uzi with the booty clip; more than one, I'm too-equipped
Talking 'bout some fake niggas, based on true events
Trying not to get pinched, smoking on a stupid stench
Lookin' in the mirror tryin' to figure where my pupils went
Flashy with a boujee bitch, Travy, that's my hooligan (It's lit)
Take the T off Tunechi and look at it as the crucifix, bitch

[Outro: Lil Wayne & Travis Scott]

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Chorus: Thomas Troelsen]
You cannot break down what can't be broken
Out of all the rain clouds, I was chosen
When all of the lights, they get low
And all of the curtains, they close
You cannot break down what can't be broken

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
They can do all they can do but they can't break unbreakable
They scared to face the truth because they hate the view
They taste the juice, I hope it make 'em puke, I'm breakin' loose
Should I throw up the deuce or should I wave the deuce?
In 1982, my momma taped me to a space shuttle
Say now I'm raising you and ain't no baby food
Unless you go and take the neighbors' food
And be afraid of who, I made the loot
When money went from army green to navy blue
I said salute, bulletproof, I gave 'em proof
Sometimes feel like my head a screw, twisted like tornado's too
Man, I'ma need some Krazy Glue
Her walls is what I'm breaking through
Her nails, she gone break a few
You can never break me down, and I can't hit the brakes for you
(errr!)

[Chorus: Thomas Troelsen]
You cannot break down what can't be broken
Out of all the rain clouds, I was chosen (Yeah)
When all of the lights, they get low (Low)
And all of the curtains, they close (They close)
You cannot break down (You can't) what can't be broken

[Post-Chorus: Lil Wayne]
G-code, G-code, we can't break the G-code
We bros (Can't be broken)
We bros, we bros, we can't break for these hoes
G-code (Can't be broken)

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
I ain't finna break or fix the brakes
You hear me late, I'm laughing in your face
Now fix your face, I can't disintegrate, 'cause I facilitate a mil a day
For like a million days
At least the bills are paid, the children safe
Want to get away? No, I'm here to stay
I'm really great, but don't discriminate
'Cause I done seen a mirror break behind a pretty face
You stickin' out your chest, your titties fake
Don't make me pick your fate
I'm pickin' out a mate, she get replaced
The heart was built to break
I'm smoking icky, watching Ricki Lake
I got a lawyer that turn any case into a pillow case
My killers straight, let's do some Q&A
You saw the news today
Got news to break and rules to break
It hurt to say, they want to get Lil Tune to break
It's worth the wait, commercial break

[Chorus: Thomas Troelsen]
You cannot break down what can't be broken (G-code)
Out of all the rain clouds, I was chosen
When all of the lights, they get low
And all of the curtains, they close
You cannot break down what can't be broken (Uhh)

[Post-Chorus: Lil Wayne]
G-code, G-code, we can't break the G-code
We bros (Can't be broken)
We bros, we bros, we can't break for these hoes, G-code
(Can't be broken)

Too much dirty money when the colors
Are washing the whites in the dryer my nigga
It ain't rocket science just rockets
I sleep in pussy not pajamas, grindin'
I got this shit down to a science, I turn in my project, A minus
Whew, I ain't crazy, I'm krazy and all of my niggas chaotic
Dressed in all black like they gothic
Music too loud to hear sirens, we pop, pop, pop up where you stay
Knock, knock, knock, anyone home?
Pop, pop, pop, pop then we outtie
I need a bitch like Naomi to take off her clothes like Leilani for niggas that's grindin'

[Chorus: Lil Wayne]
Nigga I'm grindin' for all my shit
Grindin' for all my shit
Yeah, I'm grindin' for all my shit
I put time into all this shit
Man, I'm grindin' for all my shit
I'm grindin' for all my shit
Perfect timing with all my shit
I'm grindin' for all my shit

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
The feds be spying on all of us nigga
These hoes be lying to all of us nigga
I got news for the monogamous niggas
Yo' bitch fucking anonymous niggas
I done seen it all my nigga
'Cause these hoes seeing all of my niggas
'Cause what's the hottest shit on these corners?
That's me and all my niggas
Grind for all this shit, I ain't ever fall for that bitch
'Cause picking up the feather from a lovebird
Is like a medicine ball to that bitch
We'll bring Gucci bag in this bitch
And you know what's stashed in that bitch
These niggas walk around with they chests out
Like Janet Jackson and shit
I'm sweatin' grindin' this bitch, I need a shrine in this bitch
Fuck double O seven, I work twenty-four seven
Ain't got time to bond with no bitch
Heard Jay Z got a new Cognac, where to find that shit?
The weed sticky, grind that shit
Where I got it from? Nevermind that shit
Nigga, I'm grindin'

[Chorus: Lil Wayne]
Nigga I'm grindin' for all my shit
Grindin' for all my shit
Yeah, I'm grindin' for all my shit
I put time into all this shit
Man, I'm grindin' for all my shit
I'm grindin' for all my shit
Perfect timing with all my shit
I'm grindin' for all my shit

[Verse 3: Drake & Lil Wayne]
Yeah
I got a new vision for all my shit (for all my)
I don't know what to call that shit (don't know what to call it)
I know, I'm selling all of my cars
I'm selling all of my watches
I'm selling diamonds and all of that shit
Realized I don't need that shit (don't need it)
I'm a different breed with this shit (yeah)
I'm tryna turn M's to B's in this bitch (yeah)
And I ain't ever pay to be with no bitch (woo!)
I, I, I want that Brigitte Bardot hanging over my bed
Fifty mill' in one room (huh?)
You, you could ask anyone out here who running the game?
And they'll tell you the truth, man, they tell you (and they tell you)
Oh look, they fuck with me now (hey)
I think they're hearin' me now (yeah)
Someone said, "Nigga, they takin' you seriously now"
I'm like, "I think they just might be scared of me now" (might be scared of me now)
But it's all good, niggas wrong every day (every day), niggas wrong every day (true)
Gone, goin' to LA where I'm tryna get high and do a song every day
Safe, we ain't ever have to play it safe (nope)
I would rather stack it up and put it in a safe
Then peek inside the safe and see I'm runnin' out of space
Mothafucka, that's grindin'

[Chorus: Lil Wayne]
Nigga I'm grindin' for all my shit
Grindin' for all my shit
Yeah, I'm grindin' for all my shit
I put time into all this shit
Man, I'm grindin' for all my shit
I'm grindin' for all my shit
Perfect timing with all my shit
I'm grindin' for all my shit

[Bridge: Lil Wayne]
(Grindin', grindin') Perfect timing
(Grindin', grindin')
(Grindin', grindin')
I would rather stack it up and put it in the safe
Then peek inside the safe and say I'm running out of space
Believe that

[Verse 4: Lil Wayne]
Scoob, find another oo-wop
Tell them niggas cool out
'Cause it can be a mohafucking shoot-out
Kidnap a nigga, beat the truth out
Moms pick the suit out
Top floor, window he get threw out
Deuce out, pussy bitches, deuce out
Flying out the crew out, they flew out
Invite 'em to my new house, my new house
I'm fucking every night up in my new house
'Cause bitch I worked too hard for this new house, grindin'
I'm fucking every night up in my new house
'Cause bitch I worked too hard for this new house, I'm grindin'
I'm fucking every night up in my new house
'Cause bitch I worked too hard for this new house, I'm grindin'

[Outro]
Twap, twap!
Twap, twap!
In the new house, we got the twap

[Verse 1]
Woo, this that shit they didn't want me on
I'm 'bout to act a badonkadonk, shamone, shamone
Don't need sugar, I need cream, I'm dark and strong
The garbage man puttin' on cologne, aroma wrong
I'm on, I'm on, this that shit they didn't want
I act a ass and shit a skunk, I will, I won't
Black your eye like will.i.am, you Willy Wonka
That's me in the Lam, I'm disappearin' like Jimmy Hoffa
AK-47 my business partner, business is swell
French kiss a bitch, she don't speak French, can't kiss and tell
I push his ass in the wishin' well, then wish him well
Sippin' syrup like ginger ale, but I'm the quickest snail
From here to Hell, I hear them hail, I give them hell
I'm spittin' hail,  I'm Clinton, well, I did inhale
These niggas frail, they Chip and Dale, they little gals
Watch me act a donkey, then pin a tail, spit out your nails

[Bridge]
Uh, glory, hallelujah
Holy shit, I'm the holy shit, I'm God's manure
I know how to hack a jeweller ward and not computers
I meditate like a Buddhist, Holy ramen noodles
And now you sleep, I'm inside your room wit' a lot of shooters
You wake up to this chopper tool, it's like, 'Cock-a-doodle'
I'm awkward, cuckoo, I turn your Froot Loop to chocolate Yoo-Hoo
I'm hotter than Honolulu,  glory unto you, glory

[Verse 2]
I'm awkward, cuckoo, I turn your Froot Loop to chocolate Yoo-Hoo
I'm hotter than Honolulu, my clothes and socks and shoes new
I been a boo-boo since ga-ga goo-goo and Dada, FUBU
Make everybody that knew you boo-hoo, I got them spooked too
I drive in neutral, shock the future like Dr. Luther
I'm not a chooser, your mom a cougar, I'll sock it to her
My cocaine white as a white beluga,  I like bazookas
I'm high as lunar,  I'm wilder than tigers, Nikes, Pumas
Woo, this that shit you didn't want me on
My weed louder than underarms and car alarms
Cheers, I said, 'Surprise', but couldn't party long
I got to get back to the grind and the drawin' board
But all this fuckin' artist drawin' is the art of war
These niggas' soft as teddy bears, talk to Marky Mark
I wet your block, leave it a waterpark, broad or dark
I whip the work like tartar sauce, you want it hard or raw, huh?

[Bridge 2]
Uh, glory, hallelujah
Holy shit, I'm the shit, Porta-Potty Tunechi
Unload the Glock profusely, when sortin' out confusion
Your motor mouth keep vroomin', I'm goin' Tony Stewart
I'm on the fluid, I'm ruined, I'm cold as Boston Bruins
Lost in the shoo-shoo and who's who and I lost influence
Lost my point of view 'til I find a mirror, start talkin' to it
It told me the truth, it said I'm the shit and you party poopin'
Lord, oh, Lord

[Verse 3]
Am I talkin' crazy, too much coffee maybe
I smell like money, I know broke niggas feel nauseated
The broads' elated, my boys are faded, my car's the latest
My bars the greatest, they rated X like Marvel made it
She caught the babies, she barfed the babies, they orphans maybe
We got that white girl like in the '80s, that Marcia Brady
I dicked Tracy like Warren Beatty, I'm warm as Haiti
I'm armed and lazy, I'm sprayin' until my arms is lazy
Pardon my mental, I'm higher than Continental
Went from flyin' cockroaches to flyin' without credentials
That's private,  tell the pilot, 'Be quiet, we need our privacy'
Throw you off this bitch if you wired, justifiably
Hustle wit' a motive, you know this, I'm wit' my whoadies
No snakes, no rodents, no ad-libs, no chorus
No stress, no worries, took you to a respiratory
It's self-explanatory, the glory is mandatory, glory

[Outro]
Uh, glory, hallelujah
Holy shit, I can't hold this shit, my bowel's looser
My towel's newer, my powder room is for powder-users
You see rolled up dollar bills filled wit' snot and mucus
My tires Lucas, my driver's cruisin', my partner's ruthless
My flower's rootless, my pocket's roofless, she poppin' roofies
I'm not a student, I'm not assumin' I'm not a human
You are not immune to this kind of music, you got 'em, Tunechi
You got 'em, Tunechi, I got 'em

[Verse 1: T-Pain]
She owes me everything and she knows it
I've seen all the scenes in this movie, and she blows it at the end
She keeps talking to me, cause she knows that I'm a friend
But I can't keep hearing it over and over again
I was the one that you came to
When you broke up with your boyfriend, man, fuck him
Girl I was the one, that told you fuck them other niggas
And you still went and fucked them other niggas
Most people learn from the bad things
I hope that you learn and don't crash and burn in the fast lane
But if you read this letter then you caught me
This should explain all the ways that you taught me

[Hook: T-Pain]
How to hate a bitch that owe you everything
At least a wedding ring, moving on to better things
So don't you call me talking bout them other fools
I'm not good enough for you, I thought that we was cool
If you need a shoulder to cry on, girl I won't listen
I'm through fucking with these bitch ass bitches

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
And I don't love them hoes
But don't fuck up with Wayne cause when it "Waynes" it pours
No really, I'm on my "fuck that bitch" shit
You used to be the shit, but now you ain't shit, bitch
I had a red bone, but she be tripping though
All that bullshit is for the birds, she was pigeon toed
She used to always say, fuck my niggas
And when I went to jail, she fucked my niggas
Well, I guess I'm single for the night
And you can sit right on my middle finger for the night
And if I sound mad, then you caught me
But this shit explains that you're the one that taught me

[Hook: T-Pain]
How to hate a bitch that owe you everything
At least a wedding ring, moving on to better things
So don't you call me talking bout them other fools
I'm not good enough for you, I thought that we was cool

I'm through fucking with these bitch ass bitches

[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]
Coconut Ciroc
Forgive and forget, bitch I already forgot
I'm over the bitch, and she over the top
They say love is the key, somebody changed the lock
Well, and I wish I never met ya
And I heard you're doing you, and you heard I'm doing better
And all I had to do was put two and two together
But that just makes four, but not forever, damn
So much for being the perfect couple
I put in overtime, I was working doubles
I wish you the best, good luck boo
Weezy F, for "Fuck you"

[Bridge: T-Pain]
No ain't nothing going on
Girl I'm moving on, just take your ass home
Get away from here girl, I'm so glad you're gone
This is the last song I'm writing for you
Now I see how you can be
I don't want you 'round you me all you do is down me girl
How many years I tried to get ya
Don't even text my phone when it hit ya, cause girl done taught me

[Hook: T-Pain]
How to hate a bitch that owe you everything
At least a wedding ring, moving on to better things
So don't you call me talking bout them other fools

[Intro: The Weeknd]
Everything I said I'd do, I did
I'm good, I'm good
Everything I said I'd do, I did

[Verse 1: The Weeknd]
But baby lets face it, I'm not into dating
I haven't been patient
Ever since I been famous my time has been racing
My motives are basic, this life I've been chasing
These hearts I've been breaking
And these girls I been tasting don't never get naked
They like it in a head lock fuck 'em from behind
Fuck 'em with their clothes on, put it to the side
Feelings to the side like a don do
Get 'em wet, let it slide like a sunroof
Got goals, got dreams, got a hotel-crib
Got niggas that'll die for the prince
Got my city on lock, XO 'til the death
Left town in a coach came back in a jet

[Bridge: The Weeknd]
I'm good, I'm not living like I did before
I'm good, I'm good, I said I'm good
Everything I said I'd do, I did
I'm good, said I'm good
Oh, I been good
I've been out there puttin' down that work
I'm good, said I'm good, I said I'm good
Everything I said I'd do, I did
I'm good, motherfucker I'm good

[Outro: Lil Wayne]
This is dedicated to everybody who forgot
Forgetful motherfuckers
Remember, don't you remember?
I been good, we good

(Juice 808)
Look what you made me do
Me! That's who

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm sorry for the wait, I'm sorry for the wait (Tell 'em, tell 'em!)
Tha Carter gon' be late so I cooked up a tape (Tell 'em!)
The garden's full of snakes so I had to escape
Lil homie gon' be straight, lil homie gon' be straight!
Woo! OW!

[Chorus 1]
And this that Sorry 4 The Wait 2
Yeah, and I'm sorry for the wait, too
I told myself to save yourself
'Cause I can't save you (I can't save you)
I send my goons to kill somebody
I need head proof (I need head proof)
Fuck it (fuck it!) This that Sorry 4 The Wait 2
I ain't trippin', I got Barbie, I got Drake too (I ain't trippin'!)
I send my goons to kill somebody, I need head proof (Mula!)
Then they come through and sit it on my coffee table
Boop!

[Verse 1]
Who kept this shit together? Nigga, me, that's who (nigga, me!)
Who was there when niggas left us? Nigga, me, that's who
Cash Money is an army, I'm a one man army (yeah)
And if them niggas comin' for me, I'm goin' out like Tony
(Bap-bap-bap-bap)
Now I don't want no problems
I just want my money (want my money)
Ain't gotta hold no conversation
Nor my luggage (nor my luggage)
Tell whoever's countin' that I'm on a hundred
Woo, Birdman Junior ' more like Ugly Duckling

[Bridge]
Takin' over, now I'm takin' over, yeah (now I'm takin' over)
Think it over? Bitch, I'm thinkin' forward, ta
I'm sippin' lean out a glass, nigga
All I got is Young Money ' no more Cash, nigga, ayy!

[Hook 2]
And this that Sorry 4 The Wait 2
No more am I my brother's keeper ' Cain and Abel
Young Money sharp, I'm still eatin'
I just chipped my tooth (Mula!)
Tell them niggas ' no love lost, 'cause I ain't got shit to lose
I told myself to save yourself
'Cause I can't save you (I can't save you)
I send my goons to kill somebody
I need head proof (I need head proof)
I found the needle in the haystack, put the thread through
I tried to stitch the wound back up, but I just bled through

[Verse 2]
Yeah, it's compensation over conversation (no more conversation)
Lord, I must got blurry vision, a nigga's got two faces (amen)
Lord, this game is a vampire (woo!)
Blood, you gotta protect your neck
It'll suck you dry like raisins, Lord
But fuck that, nigga, got it drawn out
Fuck that nigga, I'ma ball out
The day you met me is the day Hell froze
On the day I left is when it thawed out (ayy!)
I'm still in the buildin'
I just had to knock a couple walls down, had to kick y'all out (ayy)
Life is a movie, but sometimes a nigga get too tired of watchin'
And walk out

[Bridge]
Takin' over, Lord I'm takin' over
Dropped the Sorry 4 The Wait until the wait is over
Sippin' lean out a flask, nigga
And all I do is smoke, fuck, and thrash, nigga, ayy!

[Hook 3]
And this that Sorry 4 The Wait 2 (sorry for the wait)
Fuck these haters, throw your board up if you skate too
I send my goons to kill somebody, I need head proof
Then they come through and sit it on my coffee table
Tunechi ' niggas don't appreciate you (don't appreciate you)
You've been down since day one
It meant nothin' on day two (damn)
Sometimes the truth is hard to swallow, and to say, too
But I graduated from that bullshit, now I hate school

[Outro]
And now I'm takin' over, now I'm takin' over (takin' over)
The old me dead and gone, that's who I'm prayin' over
Might have to go back to slangin' yola 'til the wait is over
If so, then I got bakin' soda, I got bakin' soda...

- Will you place your left hand on the Bible and raise your right hand and repeat after me, I...

[Chorus]
President Carter, Pre-President Carter
President Carter, Pre-President Carter
President Carter, Pre-President Carter
President Carter, Pre-President Carter

[Verse 1]
Sitting on the world, I got life in my hand
So these days I try to think twice when I can
Money on my mind as God as my witness
Love don't live here and it don't even visit
I do this for my Uptown politicians
Walked in the kitchen and found a pot to piss in
Niggas ain't satisfied until they mama missin'
Niggas ain't satisfied until they mama miss 'em
Uh, I'm a monster, exorcisms
Tote tools like mechanics, mechanisms
Uh, detrimental on any instrumental
I say you rappers sweet I pay the incidentals
I'm beneficial, I've been official
I say you rappers sweet, tiramisu
I like my short cake shorter
Ain't no motherfucker harder than

[Chorus]
President Carter, Pre-President Carter
President Carter, Pre-President Carter
President Carter, Pre-President Carter
President Carter, Pre-President Carter

[Verse 2]
Nobody gives you a chance, you gotta take chances
Your family tree, I will break branches
Cause I don't give a fuck, I put the ass in assassin
Smoke you like a blunt then it's ashes to ashes
The future is born, put the past in the casket
If real shit is dead then nigga I'm a bastard
Uh, appetite for disaster
I want a full plate then another plate after
Uh, yesterday just died
Tomorrow never cried, the days of our lives
When shit get deep I'm never afraid to dive
Let the money pile up until I'm buried alive
Ask who the fuck want it, I bring it to your doorbell
Have niggas in ya yard like a yard sale
Smoking weed, getting head in the oval office
I changed the stars on the flag into crosses

[Interlude]
Amen, so now instead of pledge, we pray, yeah

[Chorus]
President Carter, Pre-President Carter
President Carter, Pre-President Carter
President Carter, Pre-President Carter
President Carter, Pre-President Carter

[Verse 3]
Ya dead to me, brown grass nigga
I just stand still and let the ground pass nigga
Bullshit for lunch, brown bag nigga
Reality's a bitch and I'mma dance with her
140 pounds, 5'6 from the ground
Bitch I'm in the building you ain't even in the lounge
I tried to fuck the world and couldn't even get aroused
I ain't looking for the beef but I ain't seen it in a while
Uh, and we all want world peace
Murder show, I give your ass good seats
Shit, I'm much more than a good speech

[Outro]
Gorillas in suits
The holy war, the spiritual troops
Fighting over the mythical truth
Drowning in the political soup
They shoot missiles and nukes
Taking out such a pivotal group
The body count is the physical proof
And they thought drugs were killing the youth, [chuckles]
Thank you, thank you all, I am President Carter

[Intro: Lil Wayne]
Soulja Boy on the beat

My tongue go brrrr, my dick go bahh, bitch!

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
Lay on the bed, open that twat
I French kiss that pussy, like muah
Sit on my face, M-U-A-H
Before I eat that pussy, I say my grace
Girl I'm nastier than him, I don't know why you still with him
Beat that pussy, go to sleep, she got that Tylenol P.M
Fuck that bitch until she tired, 'til she tired like a rim
Give her head like a brim, it tastes good, M-M-M
Pussy monster in her closet, full of surprises
I give full body massages, I hope that pussy smell like a violet
I hope that pussy warmer than luke and sweet as Godiva
Suck this dick and swallow that nut and call it Penis colada
Lift up that mini-skirt, that's my dinner desert
She fell in love with the Martian, I said you too down to Earth
Man, these hoes love Wayne, got a bunch of dimes, that's chump change
This shit is target practice and your bitch is my gun range

[Hook: Lil Wayne]
My tongue is a uzi, my dick is a AK
My tongue is a uzi, my dick is a AK
My tongue go brrrr, my dick go bahh
My tongue go brrrr, my dick go bahh, bitch!

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
My tongue is a uzi, my dick is a AK
Down here waiting for her to come like payday
Hoping this juice is sweeter than baked cake
She say it's for Tunechi, she lie with a straight face
But I'm trying to eat healthier, so I ate a veggie
Sucked on that pussy, I feel better already
She say "Tunechi go slower" and Tunechi went faster
My tongue is a motor, my dick is a NASCAR
Whipped cream on that pussy, dickhead like a bullet
If her hair real I'mma pull it, hope that ass feel like a cushion
I give her wood when he wouldn't? I hope that pussy tastes like pudding
And I get that ho the boot, hold up, let me put my foot in (Tunechi)
Got a sweet tooth, candy yam pussy
I'mma leave that ass smoking like a Amsterdam tourist man
These hoes love Wayne, got a bunch of dimes, that's chump change
This shit is target practice and your bitch is my gun range

[Hook:]
My tongue is a uzi, my dick is a AK
My tongue is a uzi, my dick is a AK
My tongue go brrrr, my dick go bahh
My tongue go brrrr, my dick go bahh, bitch!

[Verse 3: Trina]
Lay on that bed, open your mouth
This pussy so clean like soap in your mouth
I do my lil' dance, he scoping me out
If that dick like a tree watch me build a treehouse
Ok, the baddest bitch in this bitch, got the fattest clique in this bitch
You might drown, you better start doggy paddling in this bitch
I'm Trin, B nigga? Queen nigga, sleep in this pussy, dream nigga
I stay on that dick like a fucking balance beam nigga
Hair pull, neck grab, don't fuck with hoes that backstab
Don't fuck with niggas that ain't got shit, if I fucked a nigga then that's my dick
My mouth a jacuzzi, my pussy a safe place
Fuck me 'til daybreak, then you can go skate, Trina

[Intro: Drake]
Yeah, Dedication 6, of course
Shout out Guru for sendin' me the beat, too
Young Angel, Young Lion
More Life, no dyin'
Yeah, alright, I got it, yeah

[Verse 1: Drake]
Super Bowl goals, I'm at the crib with Puff
He got Kaepernick on the phone, he in a whole different mode
Angel hair at 2AM for Bey and Hov
Just to show 'em how I treat the city like my humble abode
Ayy, tell me if TD Bank is approvin' loans
I'm thinkin' of payin' Wayne what Universal owes
My nigga spent a lifetime goin' platinum and gold
He should own half of the label, shit outta control
Somebody get Larry Jackson on the phone
I need some ownership if we pressin' go
'Cause business is boomin' on behalf of me
I need a bite outta the Apple like Adam and Eve
We gon' have to break the billi' curse
I need my paper long like "A Milli" verse
Or too long like a sentence from a Philly judge
Fuck is the point in all the beefin' when we really blood?
Nobody wins when the family feuds, nigga
Everybody gotta eat, we can't exclude niggas
I make the crib, expandin' pools and expandin' rooms
Addin' Hammam Spas with tannin' booths, nigga
That's truth, no boost, nigga
But this isn't all about callin' truce
I'm still dishin' out verbal abuse
That shit could get re-introduced
If somebody got somethin' they urgin' to prove, nigga
Inspirin' to the youth
New Years Eve, lookin' like a royal flush
Wait, we all in the same suit
I'm Hall of Fame in the booth, nigga
My karma makin' the news, nigga
This pudding taste like the proof, nigga
If I ever see Trump, he better salute niggas
Much as we do, nigga, for real

[Interlude: Lil Wayne]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Six shit

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
I could care less 'bout your squad, I don't connect when I'm flyin'
I'm on a jet and it's mine, I just hope the weather is fine
I took the jet to Dubai, I took the jet to Milan
I took the jet way to Africa, shout out my nigga Akon
Your bitch sweatin' my squad, please get the sweat out her eye
I put the dick in her spine, I fucked the bitch in her prime
Don't get my credit declined, give all the credit to Moms
I flipped the bird at the Bird ' hey, what's for dinner? Popeyes
These chickens got bird flu, and they chirp, chirp too
Always sung, never flew, these boys Hot Girls too
If money grow on trees, I climb and rest in that bitch
Build a treehouse and knock the bird nest out that bitch
Stuck my neck out and shit, then got the heck out that shit
And when I did, I took the special effect out of that shit
Tunechi F 'round this bitch
The best thing left 'round this bitch
All you niggas some bitches, I feel like Hef 'round this bitch
You call her Stephanie, I call her Steph 'round this bitch
Now back to whippin' the baby on some step mama shit
I come direct with my shit, I come correct with my shit
A blank check on your face, put some respek on my shit
Branches startin' to shake, here comes the leaves, get the rake
I want my piece of the cake, it should be sweeter than cake
Here come the leaves, get the rake, and we ain't leavin' the rake
We made the cleanest escape, although I bleeped in your face
You playin' wit the right one today
Your flag is a white one today
You wearin' em tight ones today
Check me or write one today
You playin' with fire today
The Angel and Lion are greats
Oh my God, lightning strikin' twice in this place
Should we make a wish or should we make it right in this place?
All this motherfuckin' beef, I need some rice on this plate
Talked to your wifey today, she feelin' triflin' she say
Talked to the sniper, he say he aimin' at diapers today
Pick you off like pickin' peppers, Peter Piper today
So tell your squad I say "BLAOW" like Spice 1 would say
It's Mortal Kombat tonight, it's Street Fighter today
I'm Major Bison, Drizzy lit like Raiden light up the place
You see blue face hundreds 'til you white in the face
Oh my God, it feel like I done life in this place
But swear to God, I got money doin' life in my safe
Put on the gloves like MJ, go from OG to OJ
I make you pay attention then rip your receipt in your face
This for Cita and Nae, this for my people and bae
I got three sons of a gun, them niggas keep me on safe
Hol' up, I am the black god to the church
I am the fat boy to dessert
I am the landlord to the first, got two bangers
One of them go "bada boom," one of them go "bada bing"
I taught these hoes how to love, I taught these boys how to lean
I'm high in the sky and I twinkle
The eyes don't lie 'til you blink 'em
Keep the iron for the wrinkles
The mansion came with the sprinklers
I want Arabian wealth
You snakes come make me a belt
Yeah, you know life is a movie, you niggas playin' yourselves, damn

[Outro: Lil Wayne]
That's some six shit
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I want Arabian wealth
You snakes come make me a belt
It's every man for themselves, it's every baby for sale
And you know life is a movie, you niggas ratin' yourself
I just hope it's a porn to watch you pussies play with yourself
That's some six shit

[Verse 1]
Camo shorts and Bubba Kush
We can talk she'd rather fuss
This and that 'bout such and such
Damn, where is the fucking trust
I'm tired of the hoop and hollering
I'm 'bout to take the coupe to Collins
Then take a female to the Island
Then take her clothes off and do the honors
Yeah, now she hear I'm with them other bitches
Yeah, I told her mind her fucking business
Shit she probably out here fucking niggas
I'm fucking her friends
Now her friends ain't even fucking with her
Damn, she text me all day and night
So pissed off she ain't even spelling shit right
I text her back, and tell her it's life
Now somebody tell them hoes, I'm single for the night

[Chorus]
Yeah, I'm single
Nigga had to cancel that bitch like Nino
I ain't tripping on nothing, I'm sipping on something
And my homeboy say he got a bad bitch for me
And I'm single, yeah, I'm single
And I'm single, tonight I'm single
And I ain't tripping on nothing, I'm sipping on something
And my homeboy say he got a bad bitch for me tonight

[Verse 2]
Dreads braided to the back
I'm chilling but my swag on full attack
And my girl acting like a brat
So when she call, I don't answer, I just write her back
She hate it when I do that shit
And when I get home she go through my shit
She call numbers back to see who that is
Man I hate it when she do that shit
Polo t-shirt, Polo drawers
Now make me take this Polo off
Girl you can get broken off
Yeah, I fuck you for an hour then I smoke it off
Swimming trunks and bathing suits
Then go in the bedroom and tell the naked truth
Don't wanna fuss, ain't tryna fight
Man somebody tell them hoes I'm single for the night

[Chorus]
Yeah, I'm single
Nigga had to cancel that bitch like Nino
I ain't tripping on nothing, I'm sipping on something
And my homeboy say he got a bad bitch for me
And I'm single, yeah, I'm single
And I'm single, tonight I'm single
And I ain't tripping on nothing, I'm sipping on something
And my homeboy say he got a bad bitch for me tonight

[Verse 3]
Now she got on her fuck 'em dress
And I got on my double-breast
And he been fussing all day with her
And I make her feel special like a place kicker
She wanna be Weezy F Baby-sitter
Say she wish she could cut my dick off and take it with her
I say hold up
She say she just playing
Then I falls in that pussy like quick sand
Hot sex and cold wine
She left that nigga hanging like a clothes line
I cut my phones off, both lines
It's about to get nasty, pork rinds
She came hard, both times
We both say we single, and we both lying
We both wrong, but it feel right
Put your hands up if you single for the night

[Chorus]
Yeah, I'm single
Nigga had to cancel that bitch like Nino
I ain't tripping on nothing, I'm sipping on something
And my homeboy say he got a bad bitch for me
And I'm single, yeah, I'm single
And I'm single, tonight I'm single
And I ain't tripping on nothing, I'm sipping on something
And my homeboy say he got a bad bitch for me tonight

[Outro]
If you're single, put your hands up
If you're single, put your hands up
If you're single, put your-
If you're single tonight
If you're single, put your hands up
If you're single, put your hands up
If you're single
If you're single tonight

[Intro: Lil Wayne]
My niggas been stuntin' since way back when
CNN, I got news for you haters
I'm a nasty ass nigga, ask your bitch, I ain't lying
69, that's a favor for a favor

[Bridge: Lil Wayne]
Them hoes bitin' they lip, cause when I say shit like that she feel some type of way
I hit it from the front, from the side, from the back, I hit it all type of ways
She throw it at me like I'm just one strike away
Sometimes life is hard to swallow, but she like to taste
Ding-ding-ding-ding-ding my lawyer fight the case
I got them flowers in me, I feel like a vase
Monsters in my closet no more closet space
Niggas want to be this fly, too many flights to take

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
Enough with the small talk, my girl pussy is a water-park
Every little thing I do turn her on; that's autostart
I kiss every single body part, her body is a work of art
I'm way too high, her skirt too short, I think I love her, it was just a thought
I pop up in that coupe 'bout to go back to the future
And she said, "Tune, not in my mouth," damn you should've said it sooner
I be shittin' on these niggas, like I'm sippin' Metamucil
And we smokin' on that gas, pass it like "excuse you"
And it's 6-6-2's Piru all day, my nigga
Before these niggas play with us, they'll play dead, my nigga
And if you lookin' for me, I'll be on these bitches' mind
These niggas chicken and I've never seen a chicken fly
My bitch been fussin' at me about nothin'
Ain't no tellin' what she'd do if I replace her
Like bae, I'm straight, there's plenty fish and I'm bait
We can't even have a decent conversation

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
I pop the seal on my sip and she be like, "See, you gon' drink your life away"
Bitch it's my life, my life, my life shout out Mary J
And tell them boys that beef tastes like a slice of cake
And old folks get shot too, they write down license plates
I hope that ho don't call sayin' her cycle late
All this fucking gotta stop, but I need tighter brakes
And don't run from this dick girl, I don't like to chase
I wax that ass, she make that Mr. Miyagi face
And she ain't all that pretty, but I like her shape
They say numbers don't lie, she shaped like a 8
She say she ain't no dyke, but she gon' dyke today
It's curtains for these niggas I feel like some drapes.
We turnt up niggas, burnt up, stop the microwave
This shit might cost us our life, but that's the price we pay
I'm hotter than the peppers Peter Piper ate
This that Dedication 5, whattup 5?

[Verse 3: T.I.]
Ay Tune' I gotta turn up on the D5 man!
Hustle Gang, bang, green mean, anybody get it
Anything we'll do for the paper
And we live this shit, talk slick get kill't
Got nothin' but a tool for a hater (Spent 100K on my wrist nigga!)
This flooded rollie make you feel some type of way (I know it do!)
Your ho be on me, know you feel some type of way (I take your ho!)
The car I'm drivin' make you feel some type of way (They can't afford this nigga!)
The cash I gettin' make you feel some type of way (Bankrolls-R-Us!)
This type of way, know you feel some type of way (Hustle Gang my nigga!)
That shit ain't hot, we out here poppin' that's all I can say (G.D.O.D!)
My only problem is tryin' to decide what I'mma drive today (Hustle Gang my nigga!)
We shine all in they face, I know they feel some type of way
I wake up in a multi-million dollar crib get dressed I plan on having a nicer day
When these punk ass rappers keep my name in they mouth, like they some type of gay
You know me dog, so watch what you say (You better watch your mouth!)
We ain't playing no games with your lame ass nigga, fuckboy you can die today (I swear you can!)
I keep a chopper in my backseat, actually it's my Glock partner (My Glock, partner!)
Play crazy if you want to, fuck around and get shot partner (Get shot partner!)
I don't like these niggas, and really fuck these niggas
Talk crazy in ya raps if you want, when you see me you won't touch me nigga! (Won't touch me niggas!)
Ball all around in my flip flop, you think TIP soft? Well then why don't you try me
If you really gon' be dramatic, we gon' to need some music, they queuein' the violin
I'm talking slow singing, flower bringing
Empty a clip in you earing, and you chest thing, and you out the door
This flooded rollie make you feel some type of way (I know it do!)
Your ho be on me, know you feel some type of way (I take your ho!)
The car I'm driving make you feel some type of way (They can't afford this nigga!)
The cash I get it make you feel some type of way (Bankrolls-R-Us!)

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
As I wipe the stars off the windows on my space ship
Call out the spirits in my basement
Crawl out the center of the snake pit
And fall into the middle of her greatness
Fireballs reflect off the frames of the pictures
She's not at all impressed with the flames or the flickers
But take her for a walk on the moon she wear her slippers
The end of the world is coming soon, I'ma miss it
The sky is falling down, I am falling for her quicker
We hide amongst the clouds, then we pardon the enigma
High above the ground but I'm under her charisma
Her sound is in surround when I'm in her solar system
The quiet calms my quasars, the eclipse is eclipsin'
My astronaut helmet kinda shifted, full of lipstick
Planet of the aches, and she is my prescription
We out of this world, baby, we have been evicted

[Chorus: Lil Wayne / Lil Wayne & Nicki Minaj]
Intergalactical love
The sky is falling, intergalactical, intergalactical love
And I'll be waiting for you, for you, for you
On the dark side of the moon
Said I'll be waiting, I'll be waiting for you
On the dark side of the moon
And if you happen to get there before me
Leave a message in the dust just for me
If I don't see it I'll be waiting for you
On the dark side of the moon (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)

[Verse 2: Nicki Minaj]
Open up the curtains
Window-watchin', people killin', robbin'
The sky is fallin', fallin' down
I turn into news, and this is the apocalypse
People livin' on their rocket ships
My mama always told me that there would be no stoppin' this
Fireball reflections on the friends and the pictures in my room
Of I and you
Tell me, will I see you soon?
Meet you on the moon?

[Chorus: Nicki Minaj & (Lil Wayne) / Both]
Intergalactic love
The sky is falling, falling down
I'll be waiting for you, for you, for you
On the dark side of the moon
I'll be waiting, I'll be waiting for you
On the dark side of the moon
And if you happen to get there before me
Leave a message in the dust just for me
If I don't see it, I'll be waiting for you
On the dark side of the moon (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)

[Outro: Lil Wayne]
Said I'll be waiting, I'll be waiting for you
On the dark side of the moon
And if you happen to get there before me
Leave a message in the dust just for me
If I don't see it, I'll be waiting for you
On the dark side of the moon (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Intergalactical love
The sky is falling, intergalactic, intergalactical love
And I'll be waiting for you (for you, for you)
On the dark side of the moon
Said I'll be waiting, I'll be waiting for you
On the dark side of the moon (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)

[Intro: Sampha]
Let it all work out, let it all work out
Let it all work out, let it all work out
Let it all work out, let it all work out
Let it all work out, let it all work out
Work out, yeah

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
I'm in this bitch
Yeah, was on the outside, looking in this bitch
But now I'm in this bitch
Yeah, I'm in this bitch
Tunechi, you a genius
Looked in the mirror said
"Don't let the money come between us"
I'm loaded, loaded at my earliest convenience
But fuck 'em, I feel like I got ten middle fingers
I'm sippin', sippin' in this bitch and poppin' uppers
Girl, take this, this that shit that give a flower color
And some bitch named Wonder Woman told me not to wonder
The crumbs, you only see 'em when the cookie crumble
Real shit, nigga, my candle still lit
Had to swallow my pride, though, swear it tastes like spearmint
Big up to my nigga with a strap on 'em
I never turn my back on 'em
'Cause nigga act like they cool with ya
But a lot of these niggas be transformers
A lot of these players be bench-warmers
The game ain't easy, but it's fair, nigga
I'mma sit in this throne so long
'Til it's a fucking rocking chair, nigga
Bad bitch play with my hair, nigga
Said, "Relax, Tune, baby don't stress out"
But I got a lot of shit on my mind, though
She said, "Let that shit work itself out"
"Let that shit work itself out"

[Interlude 1: Lil Wayne & Sampha]
C5
Yeah, back in this bitch
Tune you left this bitch
Like you knew this bitch was gon' let your ass back in this bitch
Let it all work out, let it all work out
But ain't nobody else like you in this bitch
Let it all work out, let it all work out
Let it all work out
Ain't nobody else like you in this bitch

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
Cita, you a psychic
'Cause you said there be days like this
They want a piece of me, I ain't the one that's serving slices
Please swallow, I had my share of dirty diapers
Real shit, pussy niggas on that guilt trip
It'll be on in a heartbeat
You can't hear no pussy nigga's shit skip
I fear God, never fear men
Give back, never give in
Beat odds, never beat women
Keep an open mind, let 'em peek in it
Reach highs, never reach limits
Need minds, I don't need plenty
This C5, this for BI and Left Eye, and T-Boz
When I seen Chilli at the Floyd fight
I almost asked her to creep with me
But I was young, and I held my tongue
But with that tongue, I just keep spitting
So it all worked out

[Interlude 2: Lil Wayne & Sampha]
And now I'm in this bitch
And life said, "Tune, you knew me for way too long"
I never change, you know I been this bitch
And then she said, "Let it all work out"
"Let it all work out, let it all work out" (Yeah)
"Let it all work out, let it all work out"

[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]
Tunechi, you a monster
Looked in the mirror, but you wasn't there, I couldn't find ya
I'm lookin' for that big, old smile, full of diamonds
Instead, I found this letter you ain't finished writin'
It read, "I'm sorry for even apologizing"
I tried, compromising and went kamikaze
I found my momma's pistol where she always hide it
I cry, put it to my head and thought about it
Nobody was home to stop me, so I called my auntie
Hung up, then put the gun up to my heart and pondered
Too much was on my conscience to be smart about it
Too torn apart about it, I aim where my heart was pounding
I shot it, and I woke up with blood all around me
It's mine, I didn't die, but as I was dying
God came to my side and we talked about it
He sold me another life and he made a prophet

[Outro: Lil Wayne & Sampha & Jacida Carter]
Yeah, and he said
"Let it all work out" (Yeah)
"Let it all work out"
(I'm still in this bitch)
"Let it all work out"
(Yeah, thank God 'cause I'm still in this bitch)
"Let it all work out"
Let it all work out (Phew)
"Let it all work out"
(But he said, "Remember this:")
"Let it all work out"
"Let it all work out"
("Ain't nobody else like you in this bitch")
"Let it all work out" (Yeah)
"Let it all work out"
("And don't forget what I did this, bitch")
"Let it all work out"
("Can't even remember when I didn't, bitch")
"Let it all'"
"Let it all work out" (Yeah)
"Let it all work out"
("Now I'm out this bitch")
"Let it all work out"
("I'm out this bitch")
"Let it all'"
("And it all worked out")
Love you, Dwayne

[Verse 1]
Remix
We fall asleep naked, we wake up naked
You know what that means, pussy for breakfast
And I know how she likes it, I'm a psychic
I eat it then I go back to sleep, that's that "itis"
And she be by herself she a loner
Trukfit, I'm the owner
I make her moan, call her Mona
I'd have a threesome if they cloned her
And me I'm purple kush forever
I'm purple drank forever
That dick make her feel retarded
She say I make her feel special
When I ain't thinking 'bout them other hoes
Ever since you put that pussy on me
I told her put that pussy on me right
And I'mma change your life
And don't sit on top of this dick if you're scared of heights

[Hook V.1]
And shawty be like
This pussy for you
I ask her is it true? And she say like a horseshoe
She got that nigga name covered that's a war wound
She lay me on my back and ride this dick like "vroom"
Then I turn on the lights, yeah
And look in her eyes
Girl that pussy too tight
You need a pussy massage
She got a body like a mermaid
She a plus, first aid
They ask me what's her race and I say first place
Tunechi
Tell her I skate
And shawty down to earth but bitch I need my space
And she gon' ride this dick, I had a long day
She say cum anywhere you want, I give her Santa Clause face
We gon' turn up tonight

[Verse 2]
That pussy feel new
But we been fucking way before I went to Rikers Island
And now she got a man I think he gayer than a stylist
I wish we were both single like a couple dollars
And when we get together she be on that Miley Cyrus
So we eat each other up, like some Somalians
She know I got a girl but she keep this shit a thousand
Whenever we together she don't ever ask about her

[Hook V.2]
She just be like
This pussy for you
I say come and eat this bone and stop eating dog food
And she got that nigga name covered that's a war wound
And she lay me on my back and then she blow me like boom
Then I turn on the lights, yeah
Then look in her eyes
Girl that pussy too tight, you need a pussy massage
She got a body like a mermaid, she a plus, first aid
I put her in her place and that's first place
Tunechi
Tell her I skate
I ain't got no worries, no Frank Ocean I'm straight
Tunechi, tell 'em I'm straight
Tunechi
Haaa

Shout to Chi-Town!
Dedication 5, since '05!
Know that!

[Verse 1: Chance The Rapper]
You feel like Kool-Aid in a wine glass witchyo' fine ass
You fine as two grapes gettin' stomped out by a giant cask
You the best dressed with ya breasts showin'
Like a salad no dressing, take ya to ya favorite restaurant
Ask for the bread then fuck in the restroom
They don't ask for a pass when yo ass waltz in my dress room
You the best bride and I'm the best groom
Wedding presents got my best man at the Best Buy
Buyin' the Best of Fresh Prince for the bedroom
And I'mma buy a summer house, with a rec room
And a car with no backseat and some leg room
And some strawberries and some chocolate
And a fridge and some broccoli
Cause I know you like vegetables even though I don't
I won't say I won't eat it if you chef it
Fuck it, I'll hire Geoffrey to get a beverage if you should ever get parched
You feel like Ruby Dee to me, great and powerful Ossie
Who's behind the man behind the curtain? Foxy
Coffee, brown as the bosom I flew in on
Nose round like the wheels that my rims spin on
Lips full like the light on the dash was flickin', oh wait it wasn't
Oh and I forgot I'll take a microwave or oven
So we could kick the butler out and we can make a muffin
Maybe bake a dozen, my homeboy like your sister
Maybe they can bake some cousins, ooh isn't that sweet
You feel like Kool-Aid in a wine glass

[Hook: Chance the Rapper]
This is not a love song, this is a you song
I just happen to love you
This is not a love song, this is a you song
I just happen to love you
This is not a love song, this is a you song
I just happen to love you
This is not a love song, this is a you song
I just happen to love you

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
Give you the world if it was for me
My diamond grill make it hard to see, I'm lying through my teeth
And now I'm flying on my PJ, looking at the clouds
Thinking about yo ass and how it look like a big smile
I get mental flashbacks of your ass crack, lemme get back on track
You say I act like I don't miss you, that's because I don't act
But anyway, we can role-play or get straight to it
Sorry, my mind in the gutter, better yet, sewer
And when you say I love you, I stutter, "I-I love you too"
It's Wayne's world, she say, "What is this world coming to?"
And she know me and whoever together, she hope we comin' loose
She told me that if she ain't the one, she gon' throw up the deuce
I laughed at her, we took a bath together and splashed each other
Then she got serious and said, "Tune I gotta ask you something
Do you really love me?" I tried to change the subject
So I said some crazy shit to her like
"What if you and I were just letters?
That'd be unfortunate we'd have to rob a fortune teller
But I swear I think I love you, fingers crossed in my pocket
Okay, that's a dead subject, you bring it up, that's a zombie
You remind me of, my memory ain't what it used to be"
She said she ain't trippin', I know, because I move my feet
And when she figure out that she been swindled
I'll be cleaning that love bird shit off of my window
I-I love you too...

[Hook: Chance the Rapper]
This is not a love song, this is a you song
I just happen to love you
This is not a love song, this is a you song
I just happen to love you
This is not a love song, this is a you song
I just happen to love you
This is not a love song, this is a you song
I just happen to love you

[Outro: Lil Wayne]
I mean how many times
How many times I gotta
How many times I gotta say it for it to count?
Are you counting?
I loved the pictures
I needed that, I swear I did
I was just thinking about you when you sent them too
You don't believe me? I know
D5, what up 5?
I-I love you too...I do

[Hook: Karma & Lil Wayne]
Only once the drugs are done (Hahaha)
Do I feel like dying, I feel like dying (Heheh, C3, hello)
Only once the drugs are done (Yeah, hello)
Do I feel like dying, I feel like dying (Get lifted)
Only once the drugs are done (Yeah, I get lifted)
Yeah, yeah, so get lifted, yeah
Do I feel like dying, I feel like dying (Yeah, haha)

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne & Karma]
I am sittin' on the clouds
I got smoke coming from my seat
I can play basketball with the moon
I got the whole world at my feet
Playin' touch football on Marijuana Street
Or, in a marijuana field, you are so beneath my cleats
Get high, so high
That I feel like lying
Down in a cigar, roll me up and smoke me
'Cause (I feel like dying) hahaha

[Hook: Karma & Lil Wayne]
Only once the drugs are done (Yeah, yeah)
Do I feel like dying, I feel like dying (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Only once the drugs are done (Haha, yeah)
Do I feel like dying, I feel like dying (Hahahaha)

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne & Karma]
Swimmin' laps around a bottle of Louis the XIII
Jumping off of a mountain into a sea of codeine
I'm at the top of the top, but, still I climb
And if I should ever fall, the ground will then turn to wine
Pop, pop
I feel like flying
Then I feel like frying
Then (I feel like dying)

[Hook: Karma & Lil Wayne]
Only once the drugs are done (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Do I feel like dying, I feel like dying (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Only once the drugs are done (Hahaha)
Do I feel like dying, I feel like dying (Psst!)

[Verse 3: Lil Wayne & Karma]
I can mingle with the stars, and throw a party on Mars
I am a prisoner locked up behind Xanax bars
I have just boarded a plane without a pilot
And violets are blue, roses are red
Daisies are yellow, the flowers are dead
Wish I could give you this feeling
I feel like buying
And if my dealer don't have no more
Then (I feel like dying) yeah

[Hook: Karma & Lil Wayne]
Only once the drugs are done (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Do I feel like dying, I feel like dying (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Only once the drugs are done (Hahaha)
Do I feel like dying, I feel like dying

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
I ain't lookin' back, nigga
I'm a douchebag to these pussy ass niggas
Hammer in my drawers but I nail your bitch
Blunts like fingers, I'm 'bout to make a fist
Everybody die, gon' bury me alive
Grab life by the horns, put the bullshit aside
Glock clip full like the moon in the sky
I'm at the gas station adding fuel to the fire
Life ain't shit but bitches and money
I pass that weed, like I studied
Bury me in fire and watch me phoenix
Highway to Heaven, I'm taking the scenic
You tied to the track of my train of thoughts
And controlling my thoughts is like taming sharks
And these hoes wanna kick it with me, I'm a sensei
And I got fat pockets, you niggas in shape
Tools on deck, tattoos on necks
Life is a bitch, I'll make her your ex
Better turn to God 'fore I turn to Godzilla
How the fuck you gon' talk shit to diarrhea
Motherfucker it's on, I'm just rubbing 'em wrong
Put a bug in my ear, but not in my phone
I'll have a broke motherfucker run in your home
For a crumb and a bone
And put '

One in ya dome
One in ya dome, one in ya dome
One in ya dome, one in ya dome

Empty stomach, full clip
I'm gon' get it, gon' get it
My trigger finger itchin', my trigger finger itchin'
My trigger finger itchin', my trigger finger itchin'
My trigger finger itching, nigga

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
I don't like to dream about gettin' paid
You ain't gon hurt nobody like Kid 'n Play
Ain't nothin' sweet but the codeine, nigga
Eyes hella red like chlorine in 'em
I was gettin' that pussy, I was gettin' that money
Long hair, don't care, Hacksaw Jim Duggan
Too high to take a breath, too high to take a step
Two rights don't make a wrong, three rights make a left
The cops on my dick, the feds on my nerves
I walk it like I talk it, got legs on my words
If she don't suck dick I don't give her that dick
Got the world in my hands, I'mma dribble that bitch
Money is the issue, full court pressure
I like my blunt Nutty Professor
I'm a straight rider with a getaway driver
Hit you dead on the money, now you dead on arrival
I don't fuck with these niggas, too old for new friends
But never too rich for new money
These niggas buying Haterade by the twelve pack
Like two stomachs
I'm laced up like two shoes, Miss Goody
Keep that ratchet, nigga
Trigger finger itchin', I'll scratch it, nigga
Blow your fuckin' brains out in traffic, nigga
Got green, New Orleans, St. Patrick, nigga
One bitch in the whip, one on the phone
The one on the phone is in front of your home
She 'bout to run in your home and put '

My trigger finger itchin', my trigger finger itchin'
My trigger finger itchin'
Nigga

[Verse 3: Soulja Boy]
Rest in peace to the game 'cause I'm fresh to death
Rest in peace to the game, tell them kill they self
Make your death wish, 'cause I'm too fresh
'Cause I'm fresh to death, 'cause I'm fresh to death
You go broke tryna get fresh like this
Rest in peace to the game 'cause I killed it
I'm fresh to death, I'm fresh to death
What you talkin', I came out a coffin
Yeah

[Verse 4: Lil Wayne]
I just can't see myself
Living in a house of mirrors
I bought me a double-R
'Cause I went from rags to riches
And these niggas nag like bitches
Actin' like little fags like Richard
And all of my bitches be bad as vision
You got a problem
I can fix it like a mathematician
I am-munition
Call me ammo for short
Trukfit shirt, camo the shorts
Your girl is a freak, your man is a narc
With your son in your arms
I'll put '
One in your dome
Tunechi

[Intro]
Uh, Wolf Haley, Golf Wang, yeah

[Verse 1]
I'm a fuckin' walkin' paradox, no, I'm not
Threesomes with a fuckin' triceratops, Reptar
Rappin' as I'm mockin' deaf rock stars
Wearin' synthetic wigs made of Anwar's dreadlocks
Bedrock, harder than a motherfuckin' Flintstone
Making crack rocks outta pussy nigga fishbones
This nigga Jasper tryin' to get grown
About five, seven of his bitches in my bedroom
Swallow the cinnamon, I'ma scribble this sin and shit
While Syd is tellin' me that she's been getting intimate with men
(Syd, shut the fuck up)
Here's the number to my therapist (Shit)
You tell him all your problems, he's fuckin' awesome with listenin'

[Chorus]
Uh, Wolf Haley, uh, Golf Wang
Uh, Wolf Haley, Golf fuckin' Wang

[Verse 2]
Jesus called, he said he's sick of the disses
I told him to quit bitchin', this isn't a fuckin' hotline
For a fuckin' shrink, sheesh, I already got mine
And he's not fuckin' workin', I think I'm wastin' my damn time
I'm clockin' three past six and goin' postal
This the revenge of the dicks, that's nine cocks that cock 9's
This ain't no V. Tech shit, or Columbine
But after bowling, I went home for some damn Adventure Time
(What'd you do?) I slipped myself some pink Xannies (Yeah)
And danced around the house in all-over print panties
My mom's gone, that fuckin' broad will never understand me
I'm not gay, I just wanna boogie to some Marvin
(What you think of Hayley Williams?)
Fuck her, Wolf Haley robbin' them
I'll crash that fuckin' airplane that that faggot nigga B.o.B is in
And stab Bruno Mars in his goddamn esophagus
And won't stop until the cops come in
I'm an overachiever, so how about I start a team of leaders
And pick up Stevie Wonder to be the wide receiver? (Cool)
Green paper, gold teeth, and pregnant golden retrievers
All I want, fuck money, diamonds, and bitches, don't need 'em
But where the fat ones at? I got somethin' to feed 'em
It's some cooking books, the black kids never wanted to read 'em
Snap back, green ch-ch-chia fuckin' leaves
It's been a couple months
And Tina still ain't perm her fuckin' weave
Damn

[Chorus]
Uh, Wolf Haley, uh, Golf Wang
Uh, Wolf Haley, Golf Wang, yeah
Goddamn goblin
Wolf Haley, uh, Golf Wang
Uh, Wolf Haley, Golf Wang, yeah

[Verse 3]
They say success is the best revenge
So I beat DeShay up with the stack of magazines I'm in
Oh, not again, another critic writing report
I'm stabbin' any bloggin' faggot hipster with a pitchfork
Still suicidal, I am
I'm Wolf, Tyler put this fuckin' knife in my hand
I'm Wolf, Ace gon' put that fuckin' hole in my head
And I'm Wolf, that was me who shoved a cock in your bitch
(What the fuck, man?) Fuck the fame and all the hype, G
I just wanna know if my father would ever like me
But I don't give a fuck, so he's probably just like me
A motherfuckin' goblin
(Fuck everything, man) That's what my conscience said
Then it bunny-hopped off my shoulder, now my conscience dead
Now the only guidance that I had is splattered on cement
Actions speak louder than words, let me try this shit
Dead

[Intro: Tyler, The Creator & Playboi Carti]
For real, for real this time
For real, for real, for real this time
Bitch, I cannot fall short
For real, for real, for real this time (Uh, yeah)
For real, for real, for real this time

[Chorus: Tyler, The Creator]

[Chorus: Tyler, The Creator & Charlie Wilson]
'Cause you make my earth quake
Oh, you make my earth quake
Riding around, you're telling me something is bad
And it's making my heart break
'Cause you make my earth quake, oh, you make my earth quake
(Earth quake, yeah)
Riding around, your love be shakin' me up
And it's making my heart break (You already know)

[Verse 1: Playboi Carti]
We ain't gotta ball, D. Rose, huh

[Verse 2: Tyler, The Creator & Charlie Wilson]
'Cause you make my earth quake
I don't want no confrontation, no
And you don't want my conversation (I don't want no conversation)
I just need some confirmation on how you feel, for real (For real)
You don't want no complication, no
I don't want no side information (I don't want no side information)
I just need to know what's happening
'cause I'm for real (For real)

[Outro: Tyler, The Creator]
I said don't leave, it's my fault (One)
I said don't leave, it's my fault (Two, two)
Don't leave, it's, it's my fault, girl (Three, three, three)
Don't, do-do-do-do-do, I'll need-

[Intro: Tyler, The Creator]
Okay, okay, okay, okay
Okay, okay, oh

[Verse 1: Tyler, The Creator]
You live in my dream state
Relocate my fantasy
I stay in reality
You live in my dream state
Any time I count sheep
That's the only time we make up, make up
You exist behind my eyelids, my eyelids
Now I don't wanna wake up

[Pre-Chorus: Tyler, The Creator]
20/20, 20/20 vision
Cupid hit me, Cupid hit me with precision, I
Wonder if you look both ways
When you cross my mind
I said, I said
I'm sick of, sick of, sick of, sick of chasing
You're the one that's always running through my day dreams, I
I can only see your face when I close my eyes

[Chorus: Kali Uchis & Tyler, The Creator]
Can I get a kiss?
And can you make it last forever?
I said I'm 'bout to go to war
And I don't know if I'ma see you again
Can I get a kiss? (Can I?)
And can you make it last forever? (Can you?)
I said I'm 'bout to go to war (I'm 'bout to)
And I don't know if I'ma see you again
Ugh, switch it up

[Verse 2: Tyler, The Creator]
I said, okay, okay, okay, okie dokie, my infatuation
Is translatin' to another form of what you call it? (Love)
Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah, I ain't met you
I've been looking, stop the waiting
'Fore I stop the chasing, like an alcoholic
"You don't understand me", what the fuck do you mean?
It's them rose-tinted cheeks, yeah it's them dirt-colored eyes
Sugar honey iced tea, bumblebee on the scene
Yeah, I'd give up my bakery to have a piece of your pie
Uugh!

[Pre-Chorus: Tyler, The Creator]
20/20, 20/20 vision
Cupid hit me, cupid hit me with precision, I
Wonder if you look both ways
When you cross my mind
I said, I said
I'm sick of, sick of, sick of, sick of chasing
You're the one that's always running through my day dreams, I
I can only see your face when I close my eyes
(So)

[Chorus: Kali Uchis]
Can I get a kiss? (Can I get a kiss?)
And can you make it last forever? (Make it last forever)
I said I'm 'bout to go to war ('Bout to go to war)
I don't know if I'ma see you again (See you again)
Can I get a kiss? (Can I?)
And can you make it last forever? (Can you?)
I said I'm 'bout to go to war ('Bout to)
And I don't know if I'ma see you again

[Outro: Tyler, The Creator & Kali Uchis]
Okay, okay, okay, okay
Okay, okay, okay, oh
La la, la la la la, la la
La la, la la la, la la
Okay, okay, okay, okay
Okay, okay, okay, oh
La la, la la la la, la la
La la, la la la la
One more time?

[Intro: Tyler, The Creator]
I never would've thought that
Feelings could get thrown in the air
'Cause I accidentally caught that
I need some new boxing gloves
Shit got hectic whenever I fought back
For example, ten minutes can't go past without you brushing my thoughts
That's fourteen forty a day so I'll say a hundred and forty-four times
I think about you or something like that
Lost match, the fucking thought of you with somebody else
I don't like that; cellular convos getting left in the wrong
'Cause I get so fucking mad when you don't write back
This isn't a song, I just happen to rhyme when I get emo
And find time to write facts, fuck
I love you
Can we add some more color, um, like, some more, yellow?
Yeah, that's good

[Chorus: Tyler, The Creator]
I fucking hate you, but I love you
I'm bad at keeping my emotions bubbled
You're good at being perfect
We're good at being troubled, yeah
I fucking hate you, but I love you
I'm bad at keeping my emotions bubbled
You're good at being perfect
We're good at being troubled, yeah

[Verse 1: Tyler, The Creator]
Girl, you fucking with my emotions
The fuck is all this noise about?
I even considered picking up smoking
You turned to a bitch, who let the dogs out?
But in my dog house
My bitch is the raddest
Crazy who makes me the happiest can make me the saddest
Look Alice, let's get lost in your wonder-er-land, fuck an atlas
You're perfectly perfect for me
What the fuck is this, practice?
Actually, if you even consider leaving
I'll lose a couple screws in due time, I'll stop breathin'
And you'll see the meaning of stalkin'
When I pop out the dark to find you
And that new dude that you're seein' with an attitude
Then proceed to fuck up your evenin'
Make sure you never meet again like goddamn vegans
'Cause when I hear your name, I cannot stop cheesin'
I love you so much that my heart stops beatin' when you're leavin'
And I'm grievin' and my heart starts bleedin'
Life without you has no goddamn meanin'
Sorry, I'm passive-aggressive for no goddamn reason
It's that my mood change like these goddamn seasons
I fall for you, but I love you

[Chorus: Tyler, The Creator]
I'm bad at keeping my emotions bubbled
You're good at being perfect
We're good at being troubled
Yeah

[Bridge: Tyler, The Creator & Pharrell Williams]
The sky's falling girl, let's try to catch it
The sky's falling girl, let's try to catch it
The sky's falling girl, let's try to catch it tonight
The sky's falling girl, let's try to catch it
The sky's falling girl, let's try to catch it
The sky's falling bitch, let's try to catch it tonight

[Verse 2: Pharrell Williams & (Tyler, The Creator)]
C'mon baby, even though I hate you, I still love you
I love you
And Salem, my love (I know)
I'm passive aggressive (I'm sorry, fuck)
(Come here)
I like when we hold hands
(You're the best around)
See I get jealous (Fuck)
And if I see that nigga (If I see him)
I just might kill him, haha (Look)
(Look, I wanna strangle you, 'til you stop breathing)
Love, love, love
(Spend the rest of my life, looking for air)
(so you can breathe, or we can die together, you and me)
(Fuck, look)
I'm in love (Love)

[Chorus: Tyler, The Creator]
I fucking hate you, but I love you
I'm bad at keeping my emotions bubbled
You're good at being perfect
We're good at being troubled, yeah
I fucking hate you, but I love you
I'm bad at keeping my emotions bubbled
You're good at being perfect
We're good at being troubled, yeah

[Outro: Tyler, The Creator as Wolf and Salem]
"Yo, why is Samuel such a fucking dick?"
"He isn't such a badass actually. He's only here because he ran away, because some shit happened back home. He's actually a dweeb"
"Yo, what happened?"

[Verse 1: Frank Ocean]
Golden rubbers in these denim pockets (Denim pockets)
On my waist, there's a black Glock (Black Glock)
New girl moved on the block (On the block)
She been plottin' on my brown cock (Brown cock)
Last night I slept over hers (Over hers)
During sex, I overheard (I overheard)
A sword sliced the air, I pulled out the na-na
Rolled off the bed, then shot back, pow-pow
Blood on the sheets, probably spillin' from my gash
Looked out the glass, seen him sprintin' on the grass
A real ninja, with the blade and the mask
Had them gold ninja stars, and red Supreme nunchuks
Now she tryna patch me up, but
Girl, I was just tryna get a nut bust
If that's your ex, you should probably own a pistol
But I'm guessin' it's wiser to exit with dude

[Chorus: Frank Ocean & Tyler, The Creator]
The blinds wide open so he can
See you in the dark when you're sleepin'
Naked body, fresh out the shower
You touch yourself after hours
Ain't no man allowed in your bedroom
You're sleeping alone in bed
But check your window (Swag)
He's at your window

[Verse 2: Tyler, The Creator]
Night light hits off, turnin' kisses to bites
I'm a down to Earth nigga with intentions that's right
You'll be down in Earth quicker if you diss me tonight
But I'll be the happiest if you decide to kick it tonight
We can chill and I can act like I don't wanna fuck
You can tell me all your problems like I really give one (Nope)
But I give two for us 'cause you're the one that I want
Don't wanna seem like a punk pussy that simps over punk pussy
See when I'm with my friends I just put on a front
But in the back of my top, I'm writing songs about we
We, as including I, and yourself, making three
Little ones, the drums are hitting pretty hard if you ask me
You're a pretty broad in the top three
Of things that I've been waiting to come, so
Meet me by the lake around 10 and skinny dippin' and then
We can begin the pretend game, I wanna be Finn from Adventure Time

[Chorus: Frank Ocean]
The blinds wide open so he can
See you in the dark when you're sleepin'
Naked body, fresh out the shower
You touch yourself after hours
Ain't no man allowed in your bedroom
You're sleeping alone in bed
But check your window
He's at your window

[Verse 3: Tyler, The Creator]
One, two; you're the girl that I want
Three, four, five, six, seven; shit
Eight is the bullets if you say no after all this
And I just couldn't take it, you're so motherfuckin' gorgeous
Gorgeous, baby you're gorgeous
I just wanna drag your lifeless body to the forest
And fornicate with it
But that's because I'm in love with you, cunt

[Bridge: Tyler, The Creator]
I just wanna talk, and conversate
'Cause I usually just stalk you and masturbate
And I finally got the courage to ask you on a date
So just say yes, let the future fall into place (Cunt)
I just wanna talk and conversate
'Cause I usually just stalk you and masturbate
And I finally got the courage to ask you on a date
So just say yes, let the future fall into place, cunt

[Chorus: Frank Ocean]
The blinds wide open so he can
See you in the dark when you're sleepin'
Naked body, fresh out the shower
You touch yourself after hours
Ain't no man allowed in your bedroom
You're sleeping alone in bed
But check your window
He's at your window
The blinds wide open so he can
See you in the dark when you're sleepin'
Naked body, fresh out the shower
You touch yourself after hours
Ain't no man allowed in your bedroom
You're sleeping alone in bed
He's at your window

[Outro: Tyler, The Creator]
One, two; you're the girl that I want
Three, four, five, six, seven; shit
Eight is the bullets if you say no after all this
And I just couldn't take it, you're so motherfuckin' gorgeous
Gorgeous, gorgeous, gorgeous, gorgeous

[Verse 1: Tyler, The Creator]
Yo, who dat boy? Who him is?
Him that ni-guh, I swear
Stand out guy, him don't need no chair
Well, where the fuck him at? 'Cause nigga, I'm right here
I don't shop at the mall, all y'all just
Dumb mothafucka, I'm a goddamn artist
You can give me some markers and I'll draw you a closet
And you know that it's GOLF, bitch, gonna make the deposit
Nigga fresh to death like he got dressed in a coffin
Cons, overalls, and a striped shirt
The boy drips swag like a broken faucet
It's runnin', nigga, I'm runnin' shit
That cherry be the bomb like he ran in Boston
Won't stop 'til the cops surround him
One nigga jiggy and the other awesome
With his fuckin' face blown off, that's how they found him
It's Young T

[Chorus: Tyler, The Creator & A$AP Rocky]
Who dat boy? Who him is?
Who dat boy? Who him is?
Nigga, who dat boy? Who him is?
Who dem boys? Nigga, who dem is, nigga?
Why you niggas feel like that?
Mad 'cause a nigga neck chill like that
You mad 'cause a nigga push wheel like that?
Why you puttin' bad vibes in the air like that?
Nigga, who dem boys?

[Verse 2: A$AP Rocky]
Who dem is? Nigga, who dem is?
Who else step in this bitch this jig?
Who else your bitch say got a bick this big?
Who else came through with a wrist this flick?
Nigga, Guess my pants, do my dance
Spin around, bitch, you could kiss my ass
Never seen a nigga in this much Raf
Still doin' math when I miss my class
Was it Summertime '06, had the Number (N)ine
Nigga, never mind, was another time before Vince
Had the Gucci gold tips with the letterman
Nigga, dollar sign was my favorite number at the time
Fresh freshmen 'til they skipped my ass
Senior citizen, don't forget my pass
Been that nigga and you knew that there
Make the dick disappear, how she do that there?

[Chorus: Tyler, The Creator & A$AP Rocky]
Who dat boy? Who him is?
Who dat boy? Who him is?
Nigga, who dat boy? Who him is?
Who dem boys? Nigga, who dem is, nigga?
Why you niggas feel like that?
Mad 'cause a nigga's neck chill like that
You mad 'cause a nigga push wheel like that?
Why you puttin' bad vibes in the-?

[Verse 3: Tyler, The Creator & A$AP Rocky]
Fuck the rap, I'm tryna own a planet
From my other fuckin' business ventures
These niggas these days
Actin' like some bitches, like they're fuckin' with ya (yeah)
Teeth is glistenin', Jesus, Christmas
He just shittin', she exquisite, bitches be expensive
(Yeah, let 'em know, nigga) And I don't even need attention
WANG$AP on the bumper sticker, fuck you niggas
Fuck global warming, my neck is so fr'o
I'm currently lookin' for '95 Leo
My mom say she worried because I'm so ill
I should stay in bed, but got too much bread
To make, she said watch my weight
So I stayed home and start eatin' some meals
Get out of my way-way, boy that's McLaren
That's 0 to 60 in 2 point nueve, I'm gone

[Outro: Tyler, The Creator]
Fuck

911 (Call me)

[Verse 1: Tyler, The Creator]
Aw, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
My thirst levels are infinity and beyond
Sippin' on that lemonade, I need a Beyonc'
Can't see straight, these shades are C'line Dion
Sucks you can't gas me up, shout out to Elon
Musk, yeah, I got a sold-out show
Crowd wild out but don't matter 'cause you not front row
I've been lookin' for a keeper, listen to the speaker
If you fit description, hit me on my beeper
At that 911

[Bridge: Steve Lacy, Anna of the North & Tyler, The Creator]
Call me some time (ring, ring, ring)
Please bang my line, you know I'll answer (click)

[Verse 2: Frank Ocean]
Chirp, chirp
Chirp, chirp
Woke up in the 'burbs, 'burbs, with the birds, birds
Where you used to come and get me with the swerve, swerve
These days you gotta find time
Even the nightline
Work line
Dial nine

[Verse 3: Tyler, The Creator]
Five car garage
Full tank of the gas
But that don't mean nothing, nothing
Nothin', nothin', without you shotgun in the passenger
I'm the loneliest man alive
But I keep on dancing to throw 'em off
I'm gon' run out of moves 'cause I can't groove to the blues
If you know any DJs, tell 'em to call me at 911...

[Part II: Mr. Lonely]

[Intro: A$AP Rocky, ScHoolboy Q, Lionel & Tyler, The Creator]
I can't even lie, I've been lonely as fuck
Old lonely ass nigga
I can't even lie, I've been lonely as fuck
Forreal, you need to go somewhere, like, get some bitches or something
I can't even lie, I've been lonely as fuck
Old weird ass nigga
I can't even lie, I've been
Lonely, lonely, lonely, lonely

[Verse: Tyler, The Creator]
They say the loudest in the room is weak
That's what they assume, but I disagree
I say the loudest in the room
Is prolly the loneliest one in the room (that's me)
Attention seeker, public speaker
Oh my God, that boy there is so fuckin' lonely
Writin' songs about these people
Who do not exist, he's such a fuckin' phony
One thing I know, is that I wanna
Win so bad, but I'm not Chicago
Heart is low, it's real low, it's so low
You can't lift me up, I'm like Gallardo
From the start it's been real dark
It's been so dark, I guess that you could call me charbroiled, huh
I'm playin' like Hasbro
I'm really Saari, call me Arto
Crashed the McLaren, bought me a Tesla
I know you sick of me talkin' 'bout cars (skrrt)
But what the fuck else do you want from me?
That is the only thing keepin' me company
Purchase some things until I'm annoyed
These items is fillin' the void
Been fillin' it for so long
I don't even know if it's shit I enjoy (ohh)
Current battle as an adult
My partner is a shadow
I need love, do you got some I could borrow?
Fuck it, I could find some tomorrow
But that never comes
Like a vasectomy, what have I done?
I got the talent, the face and the funds
Found myself long ago but I haven't found someone (who)
Mirror, mirror on the wall (who)
The loneliest of them all (me)
Cupid actin' stupid
Do you got another number I could call?
Never had a pet
I've never had a pet
There's more fish in the sea
But I never had a goldfish to begin with
I never had a dog
So I've never been good with bitches
'Cause I never threw a ball, fetch
I never had a pet, that's where it stems from, I bet
Treat me like direct deposit
Check in on me sometime
Ask me how I'm really doin'
So I never have to press that 911

[Outro: Jasper]
Ohh! Damn! Damn!

[Intro]
Swag, 2011
Young Nigga

[Verse 1]
Sick to my motherfucking tummy
Bitch must think I'm a motherfucking dummy
Because I dress bummy, bitch think I'm broke
Bitch, I ate one roach and I made a lot of money
Popping since Bastard, (manager) Clancy's my slave master
Thanks to them crackers, my pockets are fatter than excess shit that's weighing on Jasper
I've never popped a bottle, but I've fucked a couple models in Europe
Yup, and a couple of them swallowed
Meet me half way, bitch I'm going all in
And I never pull back, shout-out to my nigga Taco

[Hook]
Fuck that, Golf Wang
Fuck that, Golf Wang
Fuck that, Golf Wang
Fuck that, (Golf Wang!)
Fuck that, Golf Wang
Fuck that, Golf Wang
Fuck that, Golf Wang
Fuck that, Golf Wang

[Verse 2]
So, a couple fags threw a little hissfit
Came to Pitchfork with a couple Jada Pinkett signs
And said I was a racist homophobic
So I grabbed Lucas and filmed us kissing
Feelings getting caught, it's off, I'm pissing
You think I give a fuck? I ain't even stick my dick in yet (No homo, too soon)
And while y'all are rolling doobies
I be in my bedroom scoring movies
Still excited like a fucking newbie
Suck my dick, motherfucker, sue me
Mom got a new whip so she could scoop me
A year ago, I ain't have no hoopty
Four story home, gotta climb eight set of stairs
Just to see where my fucking roof be

[Hook]
Fuck that, Golf Wang
Fuck that, Golf Wang
Fuck that, Golf Wang
Fuck that, (Golf Wang!)
Fuck that, Golf Wang
Fuck that, Golf Wang
Fuck that, Golf Wang
Fuck that, Golf Wang

[Verse 3]
Wait a God damn second
I'm tripping balls, David Beckham
Would fall cause shit's going down
Just like Rodney King swimming lessons
Now me and Justin smoke sherm and been talking 'bout freeing perms
And purchasing weapons, naming them and aim 'em in One Direction
(wait a minute)
It sounds like midgets in a God damn speaker
Anytime you play this shit loud
But that's just me trying to get milk now
And the grunts of the god damn cow
Hit me on my beeper while Captain Hook suck my Peter
Pan camera, repeat procedure
And when the beat drop, have a goddamn seizure

[Hook]
Fuck that, Golf Wang
Fuck that, Golf Wang
Fuck that, Golf Wang
Fuck that, (Golf Wang!)
Fuck that, Golf Wang
Fuck that, Golf Wang
Fuck that, Golf Wang
Fuck that, Golf Wang

Fuck that, Golf Wang
Fuck that, Golf Wang
Fuck that, Golf Wang
Fuck that, (Golf Wang!)
Fuck that, Golf Wang
Fuck that, Golf Wang
Fuck that, Golf Wang
Fuck that, Golf Wang

[Outro]
Cut it out!
I said I didn't want no goddamn lettuce
I don't want that shit
I don't want your goddamn lettuce [laughter]

[Intro: Jason Dill]
"I'm saying, you know, like. All I ever told you to do was grow up, don't grow down. You know, like, you know, grow up. Don't grow down, grow out. You go from being a kid, just doing your thing, hanging out with your friends. Months later you're world famous. You're a gay rights activist, and you don't even know it. You know what, I don't wanna say it to you no more, Tyler. Fuck you, Tyler!"

[Verse 1: Domo Genesis]
Watch me get this money, nigga; tired of being hungry, nigga
Nothing funny, sass me while I'm thrashing, I'ma punch you, nigga
Never made of plastic, I'm a savage -- you look lunch, my nigga
Passing all you hating fucking fags we don't discuss, my nigga
We ain't on no jolly shit and we don't pop no Mollies, bitch
I'm hocking, spitting got some niggas out here popping Ollie switch
Buncha novices, Odd Future the squad is thick
Them young niggas is back and brash, attacking with no common sense
We the last of a dying breed
And we don't give a fuck, so we cannot supply your needs
You stupid niggas who had said our hype is dying, please
My pockets solid, making profit off the highest tees
Bitch, merch twerk as I get on the verse, cursing
Nigga Dom so cool, I refer him in third person
Watch me get this money, I'm up when the birds chirping
Make actions, fuck rehearsing

[Hook: Domo Genesis]
Nigga, summer, fall, wintertime, twenty-four, three-sixty-five
You niggas gon' give me mine, I don't have plenty time
Flying out at any time, getting money, any grind
You niggas gon' give me mine, you niggas gon' give me mine
Summer, fall, wintertime, twenty-four, three-sixty-five
You niggas gon' give me mine, 'cause I don't have plenty time
Flying out at any time, getting money, any grind
You niggas gon' give me mine, you niggas gon' give me mine

[Verse 2: Tyler, The Creator]
In a world where kids my age are popping Mollies with leather
Sitting on Tumblr, never outside or enjoying the weather
Can name a sweater, but not a talent or don't know if whether
Or not they got one, tried to change their life for the better
I was the drama club kid, I run where the fun did, my nuts itched
I was defiant, always said, "Fuck shit"
Hated the popular ones, now I'm the popular one
Also hated homes too, til I start coppin' me some
See I don't beez in the trap, nigga, I beez in the b's
And I be gassing up my buzz like some bees at a Shell
Fucking sick and getting bigger like I sneezed on Adele
And bitches getting touchy-feely like they reading some Braille
I bust quick like gun-holders with short tempers, and well
I tried to tell the kids, like fuck it, start being yourself
These fucking rappers got stylists cause they can't think for themselves
See, they don't have an identity, so they needed some help, but
Really, boy? Posers looking silly, boy
I'm in that past season 'Preme shit, older than Tity Boi
Not a diss, but same with ice cream, my shit is Diddy Riese
Na'kel Smith, Transworld page 64
Poppin' like oil ollie in fire flames
I'm harder than DJ Khaled playing the fucking quiet game
The fuck am I saying? Tyler's not even a violent name
About as threatening as stained windbreakers in hurricanes
But he rapes women, and spit wrong, like he hates dentists
God damn menace, 666 and he's not finished
And my shit's missing, he hates women, but love kittens?
See y'all niggas tripping, man
Look at that article that says my subject matter is wrong
Saying I hate gays even though Frank is on 10 of my songs
Look at that Mom who thinks I'm evil, hold that grudge against me
Though I'm the reason that her motherfucking son got to eat
Look at the kid who had the 9 and tried to blow out his mind
But talk is money, I said, "Hi," I guess I bought him some time
Look at the ones in the crowd -- that shit is barnacles, huh?
They thought I wasn't fair until I threw a carnival, huh?
But then again, I'm an atheist that just worships Satan
And it's probably why I'm not getting no fucking album placements
And MTV could suck my dick, and I ain't fuckin' playing
Bruh, they never played it, I just won shit for they fucking ratings
"Analog" fans are getting sick of the rape
All the "Tron Cat" fans are getting sick of the lakes
But what about me, bitch? I'm getting sick of complaints
But I don't hate it when I'm taking daily trips to the bank
Oh but no but, shit, who really gives a fuck what I think?
My fans don't, they turning on me, shit, they're almost extinct
Fuck buying studio time, I'ma go purchase a shrink
Record the session and send all you motherfuckers a link, bitch

[Hook: Domo Genesis]
Nigga, summer, fall, wintertime, twenty-four, three-sixty-five
You niggas gon' give me mine, I don't have plenty time
Flying out at any time, getting money, any grind
You niggas gon' give me mine, you niggas gon' give me mine
Summer, fall, wintertime, twenty-four, three-sixty-five
You niggas gon' give me mine, I don't have plenty time
Flying out at any time, getting money, any grind
You niggas gon' give me mine, you niggas gon' give me mine

[Verse 3: Earl Sweatshirt]
This shit just like the nights I look forward to not remembering
So much for being sober, I hope that you can forgive me
But Momma, I'm close to the edge as possible (Why don't you jump, you fucking pussy?)
All I'm seeing is the drop in my ocular, jumping like they told me
That the 40's half off, like you know that cliff
Don't need a therapist to tell him he could float that shit (Fucking faggot)
Or get compared to fucking pair with all the program kids
So maybe a pair of pale bitches for the gonads lick (I'll show you)
Malt liquor filling me up, and all us not giving no fucks and
All of them sensitive chumps in awe when that pistol erupts (Pistol, I got one!)
Dirty one spitting that sumpy raw till his wrists in the cuffs
Brother the Pigeons is us
Bid you goodnight and good luck
(Oh, shut the fuck up!)
(Gunshot)

[Outro: Tyler, the Creator (as Sam)]
Samuel's here! Where's Wolf? Fucking faggot. Salem was mine, bitch! Was that good enough, you fucking pussy?

[Intro]
Yo, fuck 2DopeBoyz and fuck Nah Right
And any other fuck-nigga-ass blog that can't put an 18 year old nigga
Making his own fucking beats, covers, videos and all that shit
Fuck you post-Drake-ass cliche-jerking, LA-slauson rapping
Fuck-nigga-ass Hypebeast niggas, now back to the album

[Tyler, The Creator as Dr. TC]
Well, Tyler, hi, I'm Dr. TC and um, I'm guessing that your teacher sent you here to talk 'cause you were misbehaving
Um, it's gonna be three sessions: today, tomorrow, and the next day
So, just tell me something about yourself...
Well, look, if, if you don't talk, I mean, these sessions are going to go slower

[Verse 1]
This is what the devil plays before he goes to sleep
Some food for thought? This food for death, go ahead and fucking eat
My father's dead, well I don't know, we'll never fucking meet
I cut my wrist and play piano cause I'm so depressed
Somebody call the pastor, this bastard is so possessed
This meeting just begun, nigga I'm Satan's son

[Verse 2]
My mother raised me a single parent so it's apparent
That I got love for my mother, none of you other fuckers
Are much important I'm getting angrier while recording
I'm feeling like the bulls, I've got a gang of wolves
Odd Future is children that's fucked up in they mental
Simple but probably not, fuck them

[Verse 3]
I'm tall, dark, skinny, my ears are big as fuck
Drunk white girls the only way I'll get my dick sucked
Suspended from school, coolest nigga without effort
Easy to spot like black bitches with fake leopard
Soak me up in a tampon, but keep the lamp on
Cause this album pack enough evil
That you can't fit inside a Jansport
Go to school with this

[Verse 4]
I go from AP to JC inside a fucking week
Waking up with random girls like "Yo, bitch, how the fuck we meet?"
I stay with grandma, she always bitching about her carpet
Every time I walk inside the house, she always tend to start shit
No to drugs, I never spark it, I used to be bullied for honor classes
By those that were slow as molasses
Take this shit to school

[Verse 5]
Raquel treat me like my father, like a fucking stranger
She still don't know I made Sarah to strangle her
Not put her in danger and chop her up in the back of a Wrangler
All because she said no to homecoming, demons running
Inside my heads telling me evil thoughts
I'm the dream catcher but nothing but nightmares are caught, go to sleep

[Verse 6]
I wear green hats because I'm fortunately lucky
Fuck me the monster said, somehow the monster's dead
Inside of me, but the thoughts it tells me are still evil
With this state of mind, big moves, Max Keeble
I'm on my grind feeble, my music is either
A fucking sin or too illegal, play this shit in church

[Verse 7: Tyler, The Creator, Dr. TC]
I graduated without honors or fucking father
He died (I'm so sorry) No bitch, don't even fucking bother
I wanted a brother, my mother I told her
But instead I got a sister, just like me with her mister nada
So both of our imaginations are creations of the fucking situation
That's having our brains racing like Dayton
Wearing some fucking Heelys

[Verse 8]
I know you fucking feel me, I want to fucking kill me
But times I'm so serious, you think I'm silly
I'm doing Big Style Willy couldn't touch 11
Seven, what's religion nigga? I am legend
I roll with skaters and musicians with an intuition
I created O.F. cause I feel we're more talented
Than 40 year old rappers talking about Gucci
When they have kids they haven't seen in years
Impressing their peers
With the same problem, the only way to solve them
Is to go to Father's Day convention with a gold revolver
Life's a salad, I'm a toss it, eat that shit up, Rick Ross it
Shit it out, bag it up, sell it, I'm so damn rebellious
Cause my mother let me do what I want
She wasn't careless, protective she is the bear
The shit is so bare, my diary isn't hid
My father didn't give a fuck, so it's something I inherit
My mom is all I have so it's never meet the parents
When Danielle or Milan decide to fucking share
This confused boy, I wanna hug, oy
I'm bad for your kids to listen to, soy is not the choice
I'm bad milk, drink it

[Interlude: Dr. TC]
Whoa, umm, it seems you had a lot to say
Uh, who knows I might feel as I'm evaluating

[Verse 9]
My wrist is all red from the cutter
Dripping cold blood like the winter, the summer
Is never that's equivalent to me and Sarah
Well that's not her fucking name, but I think this shit is clever
My niggas wanna know if I'm fucking, if I'm kissing
But I'm sitting here downing beers simply just wishing
With a tear they try to tell me but I never listen
'Cause I don't give a shit like sitting down pissing
Eighteen, still talking to imaginaries
Hopefully they see the talent I carry just like Jimmy
Losers can never win me, you can never offend me
My goal in life is a Grammy, hopefully mom'll attend the
Ceremony with all my homies, I'm suicidal
This my Zombie Circus, I hope the majors heard this
Fuck a deal, I just want my father's email
So I can tell him how much I fucking hate him in detail

[Outro: Dr. TC]
Wow, umm
So, Tyler, if you had the chance to tell him something
What would you tell him?

[Intro: Tallulah]
Tamale, tamale, tamale, tamale, tamale, tamale, tamale!

[Verse 1: Tyler, The Creator]
They say I've calmed down since the last album
Well, lick my dick, how does that sound? Ummm
Smell my gooch, you could kiss my buns
And I don't give a shit, ban my rectum
Somebody said bands make her dance
You think you're getting cash, no bitch, you're dumb
The only thing that you're gonna get is this dick
Wait turn this up, bitch, this my jam (Where the drums at?)
Here, take a goddamn picture
And tell Spike Lee he's a goddamn ni**er
And while you're at it, pass the lotion
And fapping and Xbox Live, that fun
Before I cum, I call your sister
When she comes over, I take picture
Instantly put it on Instagram
And suplex her off a building if I get banned (I'm just fucking around)

[Hook: Tallulah & Tyler, The Creator]
Tamale! Tamale! Tamale! Tamale!
Why y'all so salty? Hot tamale is on
A can of beans, bitch, I'm on
Your boy is bad to the bone

[Verse 2: Tyler, The Creator]
Bring back the horns that was played in the beginning
And tell Tony Parker that I found his vision
And if he's tripping off my sneak dissing
Then he has to deal with me and my minions
Tryna get a bimmer, E46
Have you heard "48"? Motherfucker, I'm great (Yeah)
Golf Wang prints always cover the sleeves
From cuts for the Biebs, 'cause he's puffin' the trees, please
Fuck I look like? Got a new bike
Tire never pop like the puss on a butch dyke
Think I give a fuck, I do go raw
Then I bust in her jaw like (Fuck that disease!)
My urethra, hole that I pee from
Bigger than the obese neck on Aretha
Now turn that snare down
I'm back like I'm Rosa Parks fare on the same damn bus
Like, "You're going to jail now"

[Hook: Tallulah & Tyler, The Creator]
Tamale! Tamale! Tamale! Tamale!
Why y'all so salty? Hot tamale is on
A can of beans, bitch, I'm on
Your boy is bad to the bone

[Verse 3: Tyler, The Creator]
How much wood could a woodchuck chuck?
If a woodchuck could ever give a fuck?
Bitch suck dick, motherfuck you and your opinions
(Can you kick it?) Yes, I can sir, where the lump is
Sicker than the last bar bold-er, I'm a CO
Colorado, fuck Michael, bitch, I'm badder than my BO
Find me and Lance tryna dance during chemo
Before they repossess our strong arm bands and tuxedos

[Hook 2: Tallulah & Tyler, The Creator]
Yeah, buddy, this is my jam, na, na, na, na, na, na, na!
Golf Wang, Golf Wang, no, fuck you, na, na, na, na, na, na!
Why y'all so salty? Hot tamale is on
A can of beans, bitch, I'm on
Your boy is bad to the bone

[Verse 4: Tyler, The Creator]
How many fags can a lightbulb screw?
Well if it has a dick, maybe two or six
And tell the NRA I'm about to lose my shit
And shoot through Wayne LaPierre's hair with a crucifix
How many ladies in the house?
How many ladies in the house without a rich nigga, huh?
A little Jergens in my palm for the jerkin'
Hope my mom don't catch me, tryna set mood
Little Redtube, fuck lotion, I don't need lube, dry fist suits me
Up and down, the friction makes a (squeaky) sound
The shit's kind of disgusting
Fap time and before I flatline
Clancy chimes in my room and catch me
This shit's so damn embarrassing, like'

[Outro: Tyler, The Creator & Kelly Clancy]
Oh, shit, aw, fuck
What the fuck?
Aw, I'm sorry
Is that my shirt?
Yeah, sorry, I needed something
Clean that shit up, we're going to the office!

[Intro]
La, la, la, la, la, la, la
AAAAHHH!

[Verse]
Satan's getting jealous of the wolves, the demons say they preferring us
Books on not giving a fuck is what they're referring us (Wolf Gang)
Wolves, I know you heard of us, we're murderers
And young enough to get the fucking priest to come and flirt with us
You niggas rap about fucking bitches and getting head
Instead I rap about fucking bitches and getting heads
While you niggas stacking bread, I can stack a couple dead
Bodies, making red look less of a color, more of a hobby
I'm not a rapper nor a rapist nor a racist
I fuck bitches with no permission and tend to hate shit
Brag about the actions in a rhyming pattern matter
Then proceed to sat her down when I go splatter in her chatterbox
Atta boy, Odd Future, you're not in our categore
Torture with the super soaker at the asian liquor store
This the type of shit that make a Chris Brown want to kick a whore
That make songs about the wet blockers when it rains and pours
(Umbrella) I hate this, screaming fuck patience
Got a nigga shaking like the calmest fucking Haitian
After chronic masturbation, asking where Mary-Kate went
I want to be the reasons why all lesbians hate dick
I make this damn Bullwinkle the red moose
Game of duck-duck-duct tape with a dead goose
She running 'round this motherfucking dungeon, her legs loose
Until I accidentally get the saw to her head, oops
Victim, victim, honey, you're my fifth one
Honey on that topping when I stuff you in my system
Rape a pregnant bitch and tell my friends I had a threesome
You got a fucking death wish? I'm a genie, it'll get done
Nice to meet you, but it's more pleasant to eat you
With a leaf of salad and some dressing pouring out a teacup
Bitch, I'm Tyler the Creature, suck your feet up like a beach of leeches
Rubber more than the fucking bottom of a sneaker
Jeeper the fucking creeper, get your daughter and keep her
In the jeeps where the Wolf Gang rides around deeper
Take her to Ladera, now she's scared and you're embarrassed
Filled with terror, chop her legs off and tell her to run some errands
Put her eyes in a canteen, take her to the Berrics
Stare at Steve, say it costs ten to fuck Eric
Put her in the lake, her body sinks great, now it's time to fish her like Derek
Satan says we're dangerous, we're trading kids for angel dust
And snuff and sniff, and now that Michael Jackson's trying to suck our dick
Hippopot the fucking llamas, dead bodies, cheerleading squaders
Gave the team a bunch of fucking bees and the Keke Palmer
They will never catch him or catch up
They asked me what it was, I told them fuckers it was ketchup
Nutty like my Chex mix, she bleeding from her rectum
Odd Future wolves stirring ruckus, throwing sets up, yeah
This the type of shit that make children break in apartments
When you tell a fucking orphan you don't love them 'til they heart thin
(I hate you!) Starve her 'til I carve her then I shove her in the Rover
Where I cut her like a barber with a Parkinson's disorder
Store her in a portable freezer with me to Portland
Catch me with a bunch of fucking Mexicans crossing the border (arriba!)
I'll be the only wetback who ain't really touched the water
Cause I'll be too fucking busy tryna flirt with Jesus' daughter
(Fuck Mary) I'm awesome, and I fuck dolphins
Sicker than the starving Nigerian kids barfing
Odd Future Wolf Gang Nazi bar mitzvah
With your sister at the bar playing leg and arm twister
Evident that I'm the shit, I'm the Pooh like Tigger dick
I got these cracker doctors saying, "yeah Bob, this nigga's sick"
Animal safari, if I offend you I'm sorry
Because I'm the blackest skinhead since India Arie
I don't smoke weed, so no need for the matches
I said fuck coke and now I'm snorting Hitler's ashes
I plan on either dying for suicide or my asthma
Being the only bastard in a box logo casket
Rashes on my dick from licks of shishkabob Sagets
In some Kanye West glasses screaming out "fuck faggots"
Catch me in my attic taking photos of my dad's dick
Drop the beat here to make it extra climactic

[Outro: Dr. TC]
What the fuck?
I... I'm speechless, that was... fuck
Shit, Tyler, you're gonna need some help
I'm not a... fuck it, different subject
How's that girl you were telling me about?

Part 1 - FUCKING YOUNG

[Intro]
Day that I met you girl
I knew that it was something special
But I couldn't put my finger on it (Fuck I can't sing, whatever look)
We met through mutual friends (Mutual friends)
And this is where the story and confusion begin
'Cause I was at nirvana but I had to pretend that I wasn't

[Pre-Chorus]
There go the policeman (Knocking at my door)
Do I leave out the back and (Grab my wallet and coat)
Or do I answer real confused like ("I don't know")
Now me and she held hands (And we danced, nothing more)
She kissed my hand a couple times, (FaceTime when we're bored)
There's nobody at the door, (Man, I'm so paranoid)
Fuck, 'cause

[Chorus: Charlie Wilson]
'Cause girl you're perfect, but you're too fucking young (for me)
And when temptation calls my phone, I never pick up
And girl, you stole my heart but you're too fucking young
And this is more than a crush, I just might be in love

[Verse 1]
A six-year (Difference)
Is a ten year (Sentence)
And with the (Pigment) on my skin
I don't want to be another (Statistic)
You bring me (Joy, joy, joy, joy)
And you fill a void that was once missing
And (I can say I'm in love)

[Pre-Chorus]
There go the police man (Knocking at my door)
Do I leave out the back and (Grab my wallet and coat)
Or do I answer real confused like ("I don't know")
Now me and she held hands (And we danced, nothing more)
She kissed my hand a couple times, (FaceTime when we're bored)
There's nobody at the door, (Man I'm so paranoid)
Fuck, 'cause

[Chorus: Charlie Wilson]
'Cause girl you're perfect, but you're too fucking young (for me)
And when temptation calls my phone, I never pick up
And girl, you stole my heart but you're too fucking young
This is more than a crush, I just might be in love

[Verse 2]
When you're 35, I'll be 41, and when I'm 27, you'll be 21
Yo, this is dumb, and when that time comes for that 1-8
I'll probably run, 'cause I'm fucking terrified
Yo this is dumb,you should find someone else
I'm not the one for you, shit, I'm still growing up by myself
And mentally you're older than me and that shit doesn't help
'Cause if they see you with T, they'll think T needs some help
So when you mention "hang," I'm thinking about a tree and a belt
And I don't want no relation, shit no relation
Ship when my dick is longer than my attention-
Span, it's gonna suck if shit, hits that kitchen fan
And splatter on me like my dick in my hand
What? I'm still fucking off, not good at ducking off
Because I found a goose that I like, but I'm still running off
She gon' want a nest, that's why I cannot get fucking caught
That's a scary word, you could save that shit for the birds
But I found my wings, fuck

[Outro]
(But you're too fucking young)
I really like you
I don't know what to do
(And when temptation calls, I never pick up
And girl, you stole my heart but you're too fucking young)
Funny thing about this is
By the time you hear this
It won't even matter
I'll be in the clear
It's T and Uncle Charlie!
But you're too young
But you're too young
But you're too young

Part 2 - PERFECT

[Intro: Kali Uchis]
Boy I know, that we could be more
Than just friends, but you're scared
Boy I know, that we could be more
Than just friends, but you're scared (I know)

[Verse 1: Kali Uchis & Tyler, The Creator]
I know that there could be
Somethin' for you and me
What's your philosophy?
You're scared, scared
And I exit and wait a while
Just say the word girl
Can't you see the answers are all there
But I'm just too blind to see
You and I are cut from different fabric
I wanna rock, I wanna rock with you girl
Don't be too material to see
But I'm just too blind to see
Somehow, this world is such a struggle just to be
Fuck 'em all baby, it's just you and me

[Verse 2: Tyler, The Creator]
But you're too fuckin' young
And, girl, I know that you're the one for me
Fuck, 'cause you're too fuckin' young
And, girl, I know that you're the one for me
And it hurts, it fuckin' hurts
'Cause you're too fuckin' young
And, girl, I know that you're the one
That you're the one, for me
'Cause you're too fuckin' young
And, girl, I know that you're the one for me, yeah

[Outro]
I rock (I rock)
I rock (I bloom)
I rock (I glow)

[Intro: Jerrod Carmichael]
Sometimes you gotta close a door to open a window

[Verse 1: Tyler, The Creator]
I saw a photo, you looked joyous
My eyes are green, I eat my veggies
I need to get her out the picture
She's really fuckin' up my frame
She's not developed like we are

[Refrain: Tyler, The Creator]
Like magic, like magic, like magic, gone
New magic, new magic, new magic wand
Like magic, like magic, like magic, gone (Nigga)
New magic (Woo), new magic, new magic wand

[Verse 2: Tyler, The Creator]
My brother said I'm on the spectrum
Don't call me selfish, I hate sharin'
This 60-40 isn't workin'
I want a hundred of your time, you're mine

[Chorus: Tyler, The Creator & Santigold]
Please don't leave me now
Please don't leave me now (Don't leave)
Please don't leave me now
Please don't leave me now (Don't leave)
Please don't leave me now (Don't leave)
(Like magic, like magic, like magic, gone)
Please don't leave me now (I can make her leave)
(New magic, new magic, new magic wand)
Please don't leave me now (Don't leave)
(Like magic, like magic, like magic, gone)
Please don't leave me now
(New magic, new magic, new magic wand)

[Verse 3: Tyler, The Creator & Santigold]
I wanna be found, passenger in your car (Don't leave)
You wanna be mean, mixed signals, don't park (I can make her leave)
She's gonna be dead, I just got a magic wand (Don't leave)
We can finally be together

[Bridge: Tyler, The Creator]
You roll the dice, hit a seven, sure you right
Beginner's luck, you not my first, who gives a fuck?
Your other one evaporate, we celebrate
You under oath, now pick a side and if you don't
(Run, run, run, run)
I'll pick you both
(Run, run, run, run)
It's not a joke, murder she wrote

[Verse 4: Tyler, The Creator]
Ayo, take one look in the mirror, implications so clear
I live life with no fear, except for the idea
That one day you won't be here
I will not fetch the ball
Eyes are green, I eat my vegetables
It has nothin' to do with that broad
But if it did, guarantee she'd be gone, well
I got a plan, 'bout to walk in the pen
If you can't understand, I'm a hawk in the gym
Eyes on the prize, got weight on my chest
That I need to get off, or I ain't talkin' to them
Can't be in the picture if it got no frame
Gon' let the world know 'cause I ain't got no shame
Blow the whole spot up, 'cause I ain't'
I wanna share last names, I wanna be your number one
Not the other one, keep it on the low
I'm in my right mind, keep it on a high
Janis Joplin spillin' feelings, now I'm out here moppin' 'em
Four on the floor, pack up your bags, we hit the store
Grab our supplies, no need for masks, bust through the door
Get the job done like retirement, I admit you look concerned
New magic wand

[Intro: Na'kel, Tyler, The Creator, Lee Spielman]
Sawed-off, I eat those
These clothes, they free though
Straight from the back of the Supreme store
Don't give a fuck about these hoes--
Hold on, hold on, hold on, run that shit back!
(This is a DJ Stankdaddy exclusive!)
I want the black kids to like me for this one, man
Trashwang! Woah!
Illegal CIV!
Trashwang! Yo!
Golfwang!
Trashwang!

[Verse 1: Na'kel]
Bitch, I'm with the fucking extras
Big dog, cup full of egg nog
Don't give a fuck 'bout shit but clips and Camp Flog Gnaw
Sawed-off, I eat those
These clothes, they free though
Straight from the back of the Supreme store
Don't give a fuck about these hoes
They just slob knob in New York shows
Thirsty for the clips till I'm not flow
Pusha Georgia trip, bitch I got it poppin'
Me and Jasper going coffin shopping
Nose of the board see a lotta boxes
Bitches see the boy and they mouth be frothing
Chain is glossing

[Intro: Tyler, The Creator]
(Four, four, four, four)
(Four, skate, four, skate, four, skate, four, skate)

[Verse 1: Tyler, The Creator]
I don't know where I'm going (Skate)
But I know what I'm showing (Four)
Feelings, that's what I'm pouring (Skate)
What the fuck is your motive? (Four)
Man, I wish you would call me (Skate)
By your name 'cause I'm sorry (Four)
This is not apology (Skate)
You are such a distraction (Four)
That's what T on, aw (Skate)
Fuckin' up my ambiance, pause (Four)
You drive me cuckoo and not car (Skate)
'Cause I want you like Leon Ware (Fuck that)
Okay, say again it (Fuck that)
Okay, wait a minute (Woah)
I dread that shit, I am Anwar (Skate)
Curiosity killed the feline, gone (Four, skate)

[Chorus: Tyler, The Creator & Solange]
I think I've fallen in love (Skate)
This time I think it's for real (Four, skate)
I think I've fallen in love (Four, skate)
This time I think it's for real (Four)

How can I tell you? (Skate) How can I tell you? (Four)
How can I tell you? (Skate) How can I tell you? (Four)

[Post-Chorus: Solange & Tyler, The Creator]
I notice that you're there, but I'm always in your hair
And you're always under my microscope (Four)

[Verse 2: Tyler, The Creator]
Waste of bread, I need your attention (Skate)
I'm off balance, I need some fixin' (Four)
I'm your puppet, you are Jim Henson (Skate, four)

[Chorus: Tyler, The Creator & Solange]

[Outro: Tyler, The Creator]
(Four, skate, four, skate)

[Intro: Tyler, The Creator as Dr. TC]
You wouldn't do that Tyler, kill yourself or anyone. You don't even have the balls to begin with. What you need is me, someone to talk to, uh, it's been a while since our last session. So, tell me what's been going on

[Verse 1]
I'm not a fucking role model (I know this)
I'm a 19 year old fucking emotional coaster with pipe dreams
Since Kanye tweeted telling people he's bumping all of my shit
These mothafuckas think I'm 'sposed to live up to something? Shit
I'm still jacking off and proceeding my life careless
But getting more pussy 'cause I tell bitches I'm Wood Harris (as you should)
Philly to Paris, I'm getting these weird stares
At skateparks and airports all in a year, it's weird
Yonkers dropped and left them craniums mindfucked
Now competition missing like that nigga my mom fucked
He still hasn't called me yet (that's not your fault)
But that's a whole fucking different argument, shit, I got over it
And a couple bucks in my pocket, so now I could go buy
A couple Hot Pockets and grandma could stop cooking
Them nasty ass collard greens, pressure's on me like this top hat
Bastard intro, how the fuck I'm gonna top that?

[Interlude: Tyler The Creator, Tyler, The Creator as Dr. TC]
"Tyler, you'll top it, you'll top that, you're a very capable individual"
"Okay, you guys caught me, I'm not a fucking rapist or serial killer, I lied"
"You know, you just want attention, you'll be fine"
"I try too hard, huh?"
"No, you don't"

[Verse 2]
Made a couple thou' and I just don't know what to buy yet
The 'preme shit is free and I don't drink, so fuck a wine set
Nigga, fuck a mindset, my brain is an obscenity
I'm fucked in the head, I lost my mind with my virginity
Oh, that's a triple three six, isn't he a devil worshiper
Cause I'm too fucking ignorant to do some research?
I'm the star of the group (Yeah)
So no one else gets the respect that they deserve cause of you
(Bastard was good though) What you think I record it for?
To have a bunch a critics call my shit a bunch of horrorcore?
Like I didn't make "Parade" or "Inglorious"
Cause I'm too scared to tell my friends the way I really fucking feel?
Of course they only listen to lyrics about me pissin' off
In the tombs of Lara Croft, I'm getting pissed off (I bet)
Message boards are on my dick, I need a pissing waiver (here)
Let me bust one in they mouth, I know they full of flavor

[Interlude: Tyler, The Creator, Tyler, The Creator as Dr. TC]
"Can't they just be happy for me like, a kid with nothing, living out his dreams? Why they got to fucking hate?"
"I think everyone's happy, everyone's immature, everyone loves you Tyler, you have to believe that."
"I don't even skate anymore, I'm too fucking busy, I can barely kickflip now."
"Why? Why is that? Do you not have any free time when you're at  home?"
"What the fuck you mean I'm not talented? You see the shit that I've been doing?"
"I have, I mean you're a great person."
"I mean, I'm not that great of a rapper but as a whole, I'm pretty cool, right?"

[Verse 3]
People excited, thinking shit is so tight (For what?)
Getting co-signs from rappers that I don't even like
What the fuck you want me to do? Start to gobble his mic?
And start Jackson him off until his cack blasting off? (No...)
Fuck that, (Yeah) These niggas ain't fucking with me
Cause I don't listen to the Immortal of Tech-of-the-nique
And all this underground bullshit that's never gon' peak
On the Billboard Top 20 and Jam of the Week
I'd rather listen to Badu and Pusha the T
And some Waka Flocka Flame instead (I love that shit) of that real hip hop
That's bull-of-the-sheet, but they want to critique
Everything that we, Wolf Gang, has ever released
But they don't get it, (They don't, it's not made for them) cause it's not made for them
The nigga that's in the mirror rapping, it's made for him
But they do not have the mindset that's same as him
I'm not weird, you're just a faggot, shame on him

[Interlude: Tyler, The Creator, Tyler, The Creator as Dr. TC]
"It is, but Tyler, you're going to have to cut down on that "faggot" word, that's very, that's a bad...
"I'm not homophobic."
"I mean, I don't think you are but..."
"Faggot."
"Alright, well, since the last time we..."
"The fuck is a good performance? I get on stage and I have as much fun as I can."
"I mean, you, you, it seems like you have fun. But your Twitter posts, just.. I mean, they're really random and it's ADD."
"Who doesn't have ADD..? Well, I don't."
"I mean, sometimes, you just say really outlandish things and we just want to know, what's the problem for this?"
"I wish Thebe was here."

[Verse 4]
Therapy's been sinning and niggas getting offended
They don't want to fuck with me cause I do not fuck with religion
You see, that's my decision, you fuckers don't have to listen
Here, put this middle finger in your ear (I'd rather not)
When someone gets blamed cause some white kid had aimed (What?) his AK-47
At 47 kids, I don't wanna see my name mentioned
(I don't think anyone's going to men'I don't think anyone takes you serious enough to believe you.)
College wasn't working and I wasn't working
So I was at home jerking off until my dick was hurting
But I was determined to be great, so those classes can wait
Cause the four days that I went, I wasn't learning shit (I mean, you...)
Now I'm living dreams that I wanted since eight
And can afford to get my mother something on her birthday
(I mean, you've explained to me that you were in school, but, I mean, I...)
They claim the shit I say is just wrong
Like nobody has those really dark thoughts when alone
I'm just a teenager, who admits he's suicide prone
My life is doing pretty good, so that date is postponed for now
Wow, life's a cute bitch full of estrogen
And when she gives you lemons, nigga, throw 'em at pedestrians
(So, what are you saying, take advantage?
I mean, you've been doing pretty good, I've seen that)
I still live in my grandma's house
Sell out a fucking show in London just to end up on couches
I hate my fucking life, but when I make that announcement
My hero calls my phone, just to put that in doubt then
And then I am confused if I want in or just out
My friends really think I'm playing when I say I need counseling
I sit in grandmother's living room and just pout
And shout loud inside, sometimes I just want to die (No, you don't)
Odd Future came from the bottom
And it's gonna take a couple armed armies tryna stop 'em
(I believe you) All you fucking lames don't have to like me
The devil doesn't wear Prada, I'm clearly in a fucking white tee

[Outro: Tyler, The Creator as Dr. TC]
Whoa, umm, alright, uh, so you was telling me you went to New York...

[Part I: GONE, GONE]

[Verse 1: Tyler, The Creator]
Comparing scars before dinner
Jump off the roof into the mirror
Felt like summer to my December
Was it my August? Shit, I don't remember
(Two, three, go)
I know my temperature was set
You finally flew south
The bird gon' leave the nest, you're so chromatic
At least I had it (Uh)
Instead of never
Or maybe I'm too dramatic
(Two, three, go)

[Chorus: CeeLo Green]
Whether it's rain or shine, I know I'm fine for now
My love's gone, my love's gone
My love's gone, oh, gone
(Two, three, go)
Or maybe it's just a dream that I can't seem to wake up from
My love's gone, my love's gone
My love's gone, gone

[Post-Chorus: Tyler, The Creator]
Gone, gone, gone, gone, gone

[Verse 2: Tyler, The Creator]
I know love is, is all I got
I just hope to God she got good taste
Could put you on some shit you never seen
Could play a couple songs that you could dance to
I hope you know she can't compete with me

[Chorus: CeeLo Green]
Whether it's rain or shine, I know I'm fine for now
My love's gone, my love's gone
My love's gone, oh, gone
Or maybe it's just a dream that I can't seem to wake up from
My love's gone, my love's gone
My love's gone, gone

[Bridge: Tyler, The Creator]
You kept me goin', the Band-Aid is falling off now (Keep)
You kept me goin', the Band-Aid is falling off now (Keep)
You kept me goin', the Band-Aid is falling off now (Gone, gone, gone)
Going, and now I'm scarred for life

[Interlude: CeeLo Green]
My love is gone (Gone), my love is gone (Gone)
My love is gone (It's gone), my love is gone

[Verse 3: Tyler, The Creator]
Ayo, it's poison in that gumbo
Emotion, feel Dumbo
Ask me where my love go
That bitch walked outside the front door
Knock, knock, knock, knock
I'm not shocked, I brought this on me
It's my fault, you gon' leave
Lesson taught, see
The weatherman told me it wasn't rainin'
My stupid ass brought umbrellas
I got a glimpse of your cloud and felt better
Now it's 90 degrees, and all the tricks up my sleeve
Is drenched in sweat and delusion because I jet to conclusions
You got your thing, I got nothing but memories
I know your secrets, nigga (Yeah)
I'm not bitter or nothing, I understand that
Everybody making a choice according to plan and
We had two different blueprints, but understood influence
You opened up early on, I thought I had a permit
You started buildin' a bridge and turned it into a fence
Then my buildin' got tore down all because of your new tenant
I'll just buy up some new shit, never down with a lease
You never lived in your truth, I'm just happy I lived in it
But I finally found peace, so peace
(Want me do it over? Everything)

[Outro: Jerrod Carmichael]
I hate wasted potential, that shit crushes your spirit
It really does, it crushes your soul

[Part II: THANK YOU]

[Chorus: Tyler, The Creator]
Thank you for the love
Thank you for the joy
But I don't ever wanna fall in love again
Thank you for the time
Thank you for your mind, mind
But I don't ever wanna fall in love again

[Bridge: Tyler, The Creator]
(Got my eye)
I said go, go

[Chorus: Tyler, The Creator]
Thank you for the love
Thank you for the joy
But I don't ever wanna fall in love again
Thank you for the time
Thank you for your mind, mind
But I don't ever wanna fall in love again

[Outro: Tyler, The Creator]
Again, again
Again, again
(Got my eye)

[Intro: Rex Orange County & Corinne Bailey Rae]
When you're having fun, fun
Time flies, time flies, time flies
When you're having fun (time flies)
Out the window (it goes, goes, goes)

[Chorus: Rex Orange County]
Find some time
Find some time to do something
Find some time
Find some time to do something
Find some time
Find some time to do something
Ah

[Verse 1: Rex Orange County & Anna of the North]
Boredom got a new best friend
(Boredom, boredom, best friend)
'Cause boredom got a new best friend (oh, oh, oh)
Boredom got a new best friend
Na-na-na, na-na-na, oh-na-na-na
Oh, oh, oh

[Chorus: Rex Orange County & Anna of the North]
Find some time
Find some time to do something
Find some time
(Find some time, oh)

[Verse 2: Tyler, The Creator]
Boredom, boredom, boredom, boredom
Boredom, boredom, boredom
Boy, my bedroom floor is a cereal burial, I'm serious
I ate 'em all, dry boxes, bodies, yeah I caught 'em
If we're talkin' 'bout real meals, ask my stomach, he ain't saw 'em
I've been in this fuckin' room so long
My eyeballs are turning to drywall
My friends suck, fuck 'em, I'm over 'em
"Hi y'all, y'all ain't hit me all-day
What the fuck is the problem? Is it me?
'Cause I'm not solved, I'm... bored."

[Chorus: Rex Orange County & Anna of the North]
Find some time
Find some time to do something
Find some time
Find some time to do something
Find some time
Find some time to do something
(Oh)

[Verse 3: Tyler, The Creator]
Bored and getting desperate as hell
(Desperate, using, texting, amusing)
Cellular not amusing and I hope someone will
Message me with some plans that are amusing as well
'Cause I haven't seen the exit of these walls since before this morning
Morning, morning, morning, morning
(Morning, oh, what the fuck?)
Got some cars I can handle but nowhere for performance
My stomach angry and yellin', I need some food, I could order
But I hate eating solo
Need someone, we can loiter in parking lots
As sunsets at the border, yeah
Ringy dingy dong, I can't be alone
I been starting to feel like I don't know anyone
So now I'm staring at my ceiling fuckin' blowing
Like I have no idea where I'm going
Tick tock
(Damn, gotta get outta here)

[Chorus: Rex Orange County, Anna of the North and Tyler, the Creator]
Find some time
Find some time to do something
(Hey, can y'all help me right quick?)
Find some time
Find some time to do something
Find some time
Find some time to do something(Tick Tock)
(Ti-Ti-Tick Tock)
(Oh)

[Bridge: Tyler, the Creator & Anna of the North]
'Cause boredom got a new best friend
Tick tock
Boredom got a new best friend
'Cause boredom got a new best friend
Tick tock

[Outro: Rex Orange County]
Find some time, find some time
Gotta find some time, find some time
Gonna find some, find some time
Gotta find some time, find some time
Gonna find some, find some time
Gotta find some time, find some time
Gonna find some, find some time
Time, time, time, time
Time, time, time, time
Time, time, time, time
Time, time, time

[Shane Powers]
"Ride's over, we got some tickets to see s-"

[Chorus: Estelle]
Don't kill a rose
Before it could bloom
Fly, baby, fly
Out the cocoon

[Verse 1: Tyler, the Creator]
You don't have to hide
I can smell it in your eyes
That there's something more to say, baby
Them words
Damn, run me back, yeah

[Bridge: Estelle & Tyler, the Creator]
If I could, if I could
If you could
Find the words to say
Find the words to say
Find the words
In the garden
Shed
Go

[Chorus: Estelle]
Don't kill a rose
Before it could bloom
Fly, baby, fly
Out the cocoon

[Verse 2: Tyler, the Creator]
Ayo
Garden shed, garden shed, garden shed, garden shed
For the garden
That is where I was hidin'
That was real love I was in
Ain't no reason to pretend
Garden shed, garden shed, garden shed
Garden shed for the gar'ons
Them feelings that I was guardin'
Heavy on my mind
All my friends lost
They couldn't read the signs
I didn't wanna talk and tell 'em my location
And they ain't wanna walk
Truth is, since a youth kid, thought it was a phase
Thought it'd be like the phrase; "poof," gone
But, it's still goin' on
Big fan of the beige tan
Polka dot nose, how it goes
Had to keep it on the subwoofer
A couple butterflies wanna float
But I was always like, "Eh"
Barely interested, but bagged just to brag to my boys like, "Bruh"
This is a crucial subject matter
Sensitive like cookin' batter
'Til the temperature that's risin'
Steppin' on that ladder, tryna
Grab the rings of Saturn, I'ma
Planet by the time you hear this
Shit and chatter 'bout the heat
It will not fuckin' matter

[Chorus 1: Tyler, The Creator]
(Can we talk on the phone or something)
Because when I call (When I call you on the phone)
I hope you pick up your phone
I'd like to talk to you
I hope you answer
I hope you answer
Yeah, I hope you answer
I hope you answer
Yeah, I hope you answer
Because when I call
I hope you pick up your phone
I'd like to talk to you
I hope you answer

[Verse 1: Tyler, The Creator]
Hey Dad, it's me, um...
Oh, I'm Tyler, I think I'd be your son
Sorry, I called you the wrong name, see, my brain's splitting
"Dad" isn't your name, see "Faggot"'s a little more fitting
Mom was only twenty when you ain't have any fucks to spare
You Nigerian fuck, now I'm stuck with this shitty facial hair
Also stuck with a beautiful home with a case of stairs
So you not being near fucking fire-started my damn career
But fuck it, I got Clancy, he gave me the chance to see
A world I wasn't supposed to, I'm stoked that I didn't know you
But sucks you ain't give a fuck and considered a sperm donor now
The fuck is an Okonma? I'm changing my shit to Haley
And I just ain't being passive, nigga
You a fucking faggot, nigga
Got a show on Monday, guess who ain't getting no passes, nigga?
But if I ever had the chance to ask this nigga
And call him...
I hope he answer

[Chorus: Tyler, The Creator & (Syd)]
I hope you answer
I hope you answer
I hope you answer
Yeah, I hope you answer
Because when I call (When I call, baby)
I hope you pick up your phone (Please pick up)
I'd like to talk to you
(I hope you answer)

[Verse 2: Tyler, The Creator]
Suck my fucking dick and swallow this case of nuts
Ace hates your guts, I'm a selfish fuck
And I ain't sharing green as if I'm facing blunts
Frank is out the closet, Hodgy's an alcoholic
Syd might be bipolar, but fuck it, I couldn't call it
Supposed to be gone 'til November but quickly came back in August
I left two months through September to clearly remember all this
I would like to tell my grandma, but she just nostalgic
I'll call her number
But she won't answer

[Chorus: Tyler, The Creator & (Syd)]
I hope you answer
I hope you answer
I hope you answer
Yeah, I hope you answer
'Cause when I call (When I call, baby)
I hope you pick up your phone
(I'd like to talk to you)
I hope you answer

[Verse 3: Tyler, The Creator]
You claim to hate my fucking guts
But say I'm on a island in Thailand and I was wilding
And, if I got stranded had to man up and hold my nuts
And hope that I could live off salt water and fucking coconuts
Phone ain't got no service, this 3G is fucking worthless
Day is getting dark like the area's turning urban
You'll be fucking nervous like me inside of a Church's
But, I'ma get in contact regardless, and
I hope you answer

[Outro: Tyler, The Creator]
The last verse was about this girl, haha

[Verse 1: Tyler, The Creator]
Pop ain't call even though he saw me on TV, it's all good (Fuck you)
But now my balls, balls deep in this broad's jaw
Swallow girl, it's just nut
Bitches scared to let me smash on they ass
Yeah, they heard I'm fuckin' nuts like the swag of a fag
Like me and Tekeli was gagging in the back of the cabin
Camp Flog Gnaw, nigga, you can tell by the badge
(Hodgy, pass me my inhaler)
I'm sick of hacking and coughing, I'm often this fucking awesome
I'm animal, Noah's arking, all from this rapping nonsense
Four stories in my home like "What the fuck's an apartment?" (nigga?)
Get shit poppin' like Peter's pores during puberty
Take bets on how quick Tyler can reach maturity
Cussing out Siri like a waitress with no patience
Oh, you want a tip bitch, well here's my dick for gratiturity, bitch

[Hook: Tyler, The Creator]
Shut 'em down!
Nigga, shut 'em down!
Shut 'em down!

[Verse 2: Hodgy Beats]
I tumble-crush on huzzy sluts, give money up then nutty butt
Professor Nutty Buddy Klump gets petty when you touch his lunch
Like, what the fuck? I'm drunk as fuck, turn the fucking music up
So I can't hear these stupid fucks, talk-no-walk, let you discuss
You're talking too much, who the fuck are you to us? Uterus
I put that on my pubes and nuts, if I don't begin moving up
I'm shooting up, you and her crew on turf, new dessert
I can see the bitch in a nigga through his shirt
I can smell the whore on a bitch when she flock around my crew to flirt
It's on ya' shoulder, lose the dirt, yeah, it's the movement first
Fuck a human nurse! I'm ill I used this earth to infuse the birth
Of my scrotum on the Channel 10 news, my only motive is to
Skip to my Lou, get hip to the pew
You can drink piss and eat a dick in a few, the sickening view
Of visuals, woo, I'll eat your ribs, I'm a wolf
Then meet your kids after school, and give them drugs cause it's cool, fucker

[Hook: Tyler, The Creator]
Shut 'em down!
Nigga, shut 'em down!
Shut 'em down!

[Verse 3: Tyler, The Creator]
Hodgy, fuck this beat, nigga, let's smoke weed
That shit I need, be the shit that's green
A little purple and pink, come get some Swisher Sweets
About three or four more than needed be
I got a eighth I could face, I got a blunt flavored grape
I hate the grape, I could taste it when I'm inhaling the vapes
You could smell us in places when we walk in our clothing is always covered in flakes
Enough for two shake blunts; and what the fuck is this? Uh...
I think this Mary is laced; my heart is beating at paces
That Pacquiao can't relate I'm fucking faded like gradients
Shit, I'm stuck like the tape that's superglued
To the center of Kelly Price first waist
It's like my first date with Mrs. Mary, the shit is scary
The paranoia from this marijuana's very heavy, I'm lifted
Fainted by my fifth hit, Lionel, pass the sherm
Let's use the Philly as a dipstick for this bath salt, you dipshit

[Outro: Domo Genesis]
C'mon, my nigga! You don't even smoke, you weak as fuck, my nigga. You do not smoke, no tucks, my nigga. You're as weak as f- you're butt my nigga. Oh, mark ass nigga, Cuh, oh my God, bro. Here come this weak-ass nigga, Samuel

No, don't shoot me down

[Chorus]
You so motherfuckin' dangerous

We show 'em no respect

[Post-Chorus]
(You started with a mere hello)
When the time's right, yeah
When the time's right, baby

(Turn me up a little bit)

[Refrain]
No, don't shoot me down

[Verse 1]
Take your hoodie off, why you hide your face from me?
Make your fuckin' mind up, I am sick of waitin' patiently
How come you're the best to me? I know you're the worst for me
Boy, you're sweet as sugar, diabetic to the first degree
My spidey sensies got me on the fencies
Whole squad in Ginza, travel bag by Balenci'
Big dawg hittin' big wheelies on the six speed

[Refrain]
No, don't shoot me down

[Chorus]
You so motherfuckin' dangerous
(You started with a mere hello)
You so motherfuckin' dangerous
You got me by my neck (A boy is a gun)
That's why these other niggas lame to us
'Cause all these other niggas lame as fuck
They show 'em no respect

[Post-Chorus]
(You started with a mere hello)
When the time's right (Yeah)
When the time's right, baby
When the time's right (A boy is a gun)
(Look)
No, don't shoot me down

[Verse 2]
Oh, you passive-aggressive? Oh, you fakin' you're mad?
(You started with a mere hello)
Oh, you wanna go home? Cool, you better call you a cab
I ain't takin' you home, yeah, I'm brushin' you off
'Cause this parka is Comme, you're my favorite gar'on
Don't leave, stay right here, yeah, I want you right near
(You started with a mere hello)
You invited me to breakfast, why the fuck your ex here?
Well, let's see if you 'round a god around this time next year

[Refrain]
No, don't shoot me down
No, don't shoot me down (Fucked up)
No, don't shoot me down
No, don't shoot me down

[Chorus]
You so motherfuckin' dangerous
(You started with a mere hello)
You so motherfuckin' dangerous
You got me by my neck (A boy is a gun)
That's why I start to think it's lame as fuck
(Well, I'm here for you)

[Post-Chorus]
(You started with a mere hello)
When the time's right (Yeah)
When the time's right, baby
When the time's right (A boy is a gun)

[Refrain]
No, don't shoot me down

[Bridge]
(You started with a mere hello)
You're a gun 'cause I like you on my side at all times
You keep me safe  (No, don't shoot me down)
(You started with a mere hello)
Wait, wait, depending on, you know (All the time)
You could be dangerous to me (Time, time)
Or anyone else

[Verse 3]
Look, they be bringin' us up
(You started with a mere hello)
Yeah, like now and again
Give a fuck what they talkin' 'bout, I see you as a 10
I'ma leave it at that, I'ma leave us as friends
'Cause the irony is I don't wanna see you again
Stay the fuck away from me
Stay the fuck away from me
Stay the fuck away from me
I ain't gon' repeat myself, but stay the fuck away from me

[Outro]
(You started with a mere hello)
(A boy is a gun)
No, don't shoot me down
(You started with a mere hello)
(A boy is a gun)

Hey, don't do anything that I say in this song, okay?
It's fucking fiction
If anything happens, don't fucking blame me
White America, fuck Bill O'Reilly
Four, three, two, one

[Verse 1]
What the fuck I look like? Saying I'm sorry
To a bunch of fucking fags that can't potentially harm me?
I ain't never gonna bow down to your expectations
By the way, I got sixty fucking wolves that'll guard me
That skate hard, Thrash' black hoodies, try something
Make sure your fuckin' feelings end up up in a Glad bag
Fuck all your opinions, I'm tyin' 'em with a shoestring

Fuck cops, I'm a fucking rockstar
Rebel and defiance makes my motherfucking cock hard
Fuck pigs, fuck guards, all some fucking retards
Fuck school, I'm a fuck up? Fuck Harvard

Child support ain't come, that faggot still ain't bought me anything

I'm a fucking unicorn
And fuck anybody, who say I'm not
Wolf Gang

[Bridge]
Fuck your traditions, (and) fuck your positions (and)
Fuck your religion, (and) fuck your decisions
(See,) they're not mine, so you gotta let 'em go
See, we can be ourselves, but you gotta let us know
Fuck your traditions, (and) fuck your positions (and)
Fuck your religion, (and) fuck your decisions
(See,) they're not mine, you gotta let 'em go
See, we can be ourselves, but you gotta let us know
Fuck your traditions, (and) fuck your positions (and)
Fuck your religion, (and) fuck your decisions
(See,) they're not mine, so you gotta let 'em go
See, we can be ourselves, but you gotta let us know
Go
You gotta let 'em go, let 'em go
You gotta let 'em go
You gotta let 'em go, let 'em go
You gotta let 'em go...

[Outro: Dr. TC & Tyler, The Creator]
You gotta let these shits go, man. It's not making sense to you right now, but... all these little dreams you got, they're not shit. All this rebellion, all this crazy shit you got, saying this shit... getting too old for this shit, man, you gotta grow out of it. Growing up, your dreams are getting bigger. You gotta look at reality, understand that shit, so you don't get caught. I'm just being real
Nigga, fuck you
I'm just trying to help you, man, trust me
Look, I mature day after day, nigga, you don't know shit, you're a fucking therapist
Whatever

[Intro: Tyler]
Odd Future
Wolf Gang
They are them
We are us
Kill them all (Do it with me)
Wolf Gang, Wolf Gang, Wolf Gang, Wolf Gang, come on
Wolf Gang, Wolf Gang, Wolf Gang, bitch, bitch over there in the yellow, come on
Wolf Gang, Wolf Gang
Say it loud!
Like you mean it!
Wolf Gang, Wolf Gang
Nigga had the fucking nerve to call me immature
Fuck you think I made Odd Future for?
To wear fucking suits and make good decisions?
Fuck that nigga, Wolf Gang

[Verse 1: Tyler]
Who the fuck invited Mr. I Don't Give a Fuck
Who cries about his daddy in a blog because his music sucks? (I did!)
Well, you fucking up, and truthfully I had enough
And fuck rolling papers, I'm a rebel, bitch, I'm ashing blunts (Sorry)
Full of shit, like I ate that john
Come on kids, fuck that class and hit that bong
Let's buy guns and kill those kids with dads and mom
With nice homes, 401ks, and nice ass lawns
Those privileged fucks got to learn that we ain't taking no shit
Like Ellen DeGeneres clitoris is playing with dick
I'm jealous as shit, cause I ain't got no home meal to come to
So, if you do, I'm throwing fingers out screaming "fuck you"
I got ten of these Kennedy's
Not Dom, but if I was a Dahm, I would be Jeffery
'Preme hat the color of a leprechaun with leprosy
I'm fucking 'bout it, 'bout it, like I'm Master P in '96
It's fucking immaculate, the way your daughter smacking dicks
Surprised she hasn't taken gymnastic dick inside her alley-oop
The Golf Wang hooligans is fucking up the school again
And showing you and yours that breaking rules is fucking cool again
I'm going harder than a midget jumping over me
Chronic youth, I'm shoving blunt wraps in bitches ovaries
Punches to the stomach where that bastard kid supposed to be
Fuck a mask, I want that ho to know it's me, ugh

[Chorus]
Wolf Gang, Wolf Gang
It's the Wolf Gang, Wolf Gang
Wolf Wolf Gang, it's the Wolf Gang
It's the Wolf Gang, Golf Wang
It's the Wolf Gang, Wolf Gang
Wolf Gang, triple six crew
It's the Wolf Gang, Golf Wang
Wolf Gang kill them

[Verse 2: Hodgy]
My love is gone for you mami, you could ride in hearses
I'm sick in the brain dumb bitch, can you nurse this?
You told me life would never, ever, ever get this perfect
Then you smoke a J of weed, and take his kids to the churches
Uh, fuck church, they singing and the shit ain't even worth it
In the choir, whores and liars, scumbags and the dirt, bitch
You told me God was the answer
When I ask him for shit, I get no answer, so God is the cancer
I'm stuck in triangles, looking for my angel
Kill me with a chainsaw, and let my balls dangle
Triple six is my number, you can get it off my Tumblr

[Chorus]
Wolf Gang, Wolf Gang
It's the Wolf Gang, Wolf Gang
Wolf Wolf Gang, it's the Wolf Gang
It's the Wolf Gang, Golf Wang
It's the Wolf Gang, Wolf Gang
Wolf Gang, triple six crew
It's the Wolf Gang, Golf Wang
Wolf Gang kill them

[Verse 3: Hodgy]
It was hilarious, well it ain't fucking funny now
I'll push this fucking pregnant clown into a hydrant stuck in the ground
I step through the stomach, replace the baby with some fucking pounds
"My baby daddy shoot bricks, the nigga also shoot rounds"
Cause if I shoot blanks, oops, thanks
I'm right back in it dead yummy and her mildew stank

[Tyler]
Free Earl, that's the fucking shit
And if you disagree, suck a couple pimple-covered dicks
Um, Wolf Gang, that's the fucking clique
Golf Wang kill them all nigga, triple six
Fuck 2DopeBoyz, all them niggas bitches
We don't need y'all, The Fader's who we really fucking with, bitch

[Outro]
And we don't fucking make horrorcore, you fucking idiots
Listen deeper than the music before you put it in a box, Wolf Gang

[Part 1 | PartyIsntOver]

[Verse: Tyler The Creator]
Uhm, I said, the party isn't over
We could still dance, but I don't have no rhythm
So fuck it, take a chance with me
The party isn't over, we could still dance girl
But I don't have no rhythm
So fuck it, take a chance with a nigga
Like me, like me
Uhm, I said, the party isn't over
We could still dance, but I don't have no rhythm
So fuck it, take a chance with me
The party isn't over, we could still dance girl
But I don't have no rhythm
So fuck it, take a chance with a nigga
Like me, like me

[Part 2 | Campfire]

[Verse 1: Tyler The Creator]
Yeah, um
All I needed was a stick, grab the marshmallows
Motherfuckers getting lynched and burned
I earned it, my Flog Gnaw badge is looking good
On this brand new jacket
The donuts on the flag waving over the cabin
Now grab them graham crackers and pass them over here
Hurry, quickly I need a piece of Hersheys
Darker than the corners of the bushes we be lurking
I centered the mellow over the graham
Heated it too long now, it's melting over my hand
Fuck it, I'll bite it, I burnt it, but I liked it
Camping with my niggas, its so fucking exciting

[Interlude: Kids]
We're making s'mores by the campfire
Camp Flog Gnaw, Golf Wang summer

[Verse 2: Laetitia Sadier]
Sat by the fire
To witness gentle, but radical
Transformation, ceased to be mindless
Create our own sweetness
At last growing the heart

[Interlude: Tyler, the Creator]
Yo bring the bass back in
Yeah, haha
Who ate all the fuckin' chocolate?
Oh that's Domo fat ass, haha
Yeah
I ain't trying to go home, really

[Part 3 | Bimmer]

[Hook: Tyler The Creator]
You remind me of my bimmer
A lot of trunk space, the perfect two seater
And you got a lot of drive, I'm trying to keep up
But it's not a lot of miles on ya meter
You remind me of my bimmer
See your ignition, baby girl I'm trying to key up
And your head lights are off, I'm trying to see 'em
But it's not a lot of miles on ya meter
So let me start it up and smash

[Verse 1: Tyler The Creator & (Frank Ocean)]
Pop some Tame Impala, your man got a lame Impala
(It'll get dark outside soon)
And I'm sharing Slurpees and you ain't even begin to swallow
You're fucking nuts, green top we coupled up
Run my fingers through em as you wax and buff my muffler
Cause I fingered you, you think the fucking ring is coming up?
(Where the street lights trail, Oooooooo)
Maybe, I don't know, I think you're chill
(Ride for)
Riding on my pegs, and my back against your legs
And a seatbelt is needed if I get between 'em, yeah


[Hook: Tyler The Creator]
You remind me of my bimmer
A lot of trunk space, the perfect two seater
And you got a lot of drive, I'm trying to keep up
But it's not a lot of miles on ya meter
You remind me of my bimmer
See your ignition, baby girl I'm trying to key up
And your head lights are off, I'm trying to see 'em
But it's not a lot of miles on ya meter
So let me start it up and smash

[Verse 2: Frank Ocean]
Mmmm it'll get dark outside, soon (My baby, ride for me)
Where the street lights trail (My baby, ride for me)
You ain't gotta lie to kick it darling
It's cool we're moving slow

[Bridge: Tyler The Creator]
You remind me of my bimmer
A lot of trunk space, the perfect two seater
You got a lot of drive I'm trying to keep up
But it's not a lot of miles on ya meter
You remind me of my bimmer, smash
You remind me of my bimmer

[Outro: Lionel]
Where you been, man?
Oh, I had a drop off to make real quick. Hey, have you seen Salem?
Oh she with that new dude, Wolf, or, Darnell, whatever his name is
Fuck that nigga, man. Hey you know where they went?
I seen 'em going down by the lake
What the fuck!
You good man? You need some sherm? I got some
I got a can of these baked beans too

[Verse 1: Tyler, The Creator, Earl Sweatshirt]
Uh, addicts arise when I arrive
In this cracked crack fag back slab in disguise
Fat sack of knives in the passenger side
Bitch, reach for the door, get your access denied
I'm not an asshole, I just don't give a fuck a lot
The only time I do is when a bitch is screaming "Tyler, stop!"
The big bad wolf; to me, you're just a minor fox
Red Riding is getting some of this wolfly odder cock
We the niggas you scared of like bad dentists
Flow is anthemic, dirty like it's plants in it
Sick, spit a pandemic, crack and cancer mixed with cannabis
To have a bitch ready to stab a clit with some glass and shit
Your whole gang'll be diminished, bunch got the Brady's in it
Spit sick shit like my saliva got the rabies in it
Fuck rap, I'll be a landlord so I can rape the tenant's daughter
Leave my house with a new stomach, and a baby in it
Face it, me and Ace is sick like malaria carri'

[Interlude: Tyler, The Creator, Earl Sweatshirt]
"Augh! Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, stop!"
"Why did you do that?"
"Say sorry, say sorry!"
"Sorry! I'm sorry as fuck!
"Say sorry!"
"I'm sorry as fuck, ow, ow!"
"Say sorry!"
"I'm sorry! Don't look at this!"
"Say sorry"
"Don't look at this, ow stop!"
"Say sorry!"
"Ow! Stop 'fore you fuck something up!"
"Say, "Sorry!"
"Say, "Sor-"
"Sorry, sorry'Uncle!"
"I fucked this nigga eye up man haha"

[Verse 2: Tyler, The Creator, Earl Sweatshirt]
Face it, me and Ace is sick like malaria carriers
Jim Carrey her to the cemetery to bury her
Listen busters, scarier when I finger fuck her
After I dig her up and then eat her out with a bit of mustard
Took karate, mommy told me "Tyler toughen up"
Rihanna haircut, somebody tell Chris Brown to fuck me up
Had to teach the bitch manners, now I gotta learn her
I'll beat the fuck out your bitch anonymous, Ike Turner
Over, sloppy seconds is my preference
Except for when I'm feeding on the flesh of a pedestrian
Nessy loch monster stop Will he though? Probably not
Silly hoes lick my balls like FIFA lollipops
Get the certain tingle, eating H'agen-Dazs
With some soccer moms where they like to fucking sit and mingle
Watch an Animal Planet document on the Eagles
In the flyest '06 Supreme beanie, Sigel
Your grind's feeble, I'm regal, really, I'm Willy Smith
I am Legend, a snicker dick in a vanilli chick
Come take a stab at it faggot, I pre-ordered your casket
This is known as a classic, yeah that chapped lips crack shit
Hat is always forest so the bitches call me Gump
But compliment her tits and then its off to hump her
Fuck her in a Hummer while I rape her then I put her in a slumber
It's not a figure of speech when I tell you that I dumped her
Known narcissists, sipping on arsenic
Carved carcasses in the garage, don't park in it
Hard as finding retarded kids at Harvard
It's Wolf Gang barking keep you up like car alarms and shit
Over the edge, yeah I hide in a potato sack
'Cause I'm cold as ice like Anasia when she fucking Traq
I'm the type to put you down to bring myself up
So when I rape a bitch I hold her down and get my best nut
The reincarnation of '98 Eminem
60 Crip and Grizzly and some RMK Denim
Pay attention I'm stabbing your women friends, like a gentleman
Then dipping with the fucking pen to go sin again
White girl, you can ask her what the dick be like
At monster madness doing drive by's on a fucking fixie bike
Fuck it, moron, snorting oxycontin, wearing cotton
Oxymoron like buff faggots playing sissy dikes
This the shit that get cripple bitches to hop
Dirty crack pipes lit, bullshit to stop, halt
Boss broke, spouse choke, blouse open
Sly's little shop of horrors, now showing
I hate gays, gangbangers and fucking jerkers
Unless it's gay gangbangers, that's fucking jerkers
Whoa yo, yo.. no homo, I'm not gay, faggot
Odd Future Wolf Gang, Wu-Tang banging in your system
Probably banging in your sister
With my children swimming in her system
Let me say this shit in slow-mo, homo
You don't fucking skate, take off that box logo

[Verse]
Went to Six Flags, six fags came up
And said "Ayo! Can we get a pic?" I said no
And they said "Oh! It's Wolf Gang, "Yonkers", Goblin is my shit though"
Now I'm like, "fuck, I don't want to be an asshole"
So I'm sitting there posing with Travis, Devon
With a fake smile like her titties was drawing it on
So fucking annoyed 'cause I missed Goliath
'Cause some kid said I was there, then they caused a riot (Tyler's here!)
Now I'm surrounded by a 25 hound of fuckers tryna get a photo
All because they noticed the top with the box logo
And them fucking ears, guarantee they didn't even hear Bastard
They bandwagon-jumped me from a pogo
I'm going fucking loco, "Hey, Tyler, can I...?"
No, bitch, don't you see me tryna buy a fucking churro?
"But Tyler, you're my hero, I used to get bullied
Until I heard "Radicals," the last part got to me
See, I used to give a fuck until my cock would bleed
Now I'm the happiest I think I'll ever ever be
My life is just like yours, no father
My momma must have forgot to stop with a popped condom
In school I was the one that was thinking outside boxes
So everybody in them would say that I got problems
So when I heard you say it, I said it back like fuck 'em
You're an inspiration to niggas like me
Not the niggas who just like you 'cause of lyrics and beats
I'm talking 'bout the niggas who don't know where they're going to be
I heard the song "Bastard" right in the moment of heat
Not in summer, but of course, I was holding a heat
Gun on the edge of my feet, I heard that first piano chord
And it drew me in like predators carrying treats
Then I said to myself, "Fuck, is he speaking to me?"
See, me and you, we go together like snare and a beat
I mean snare and a kick drum, see my forearm?
I carved OF on it this morning with a glass shard
On my green mini ramp that I built in my backyard (that's weird)
That's hard, that scar from playing air guitar
When I see you play at the Roxy (uhh)
Tyler, I love you, wanna be just like you (alright)
I think about your face and I don't even fucking try to (no homo)
Wish I had a basement meant for me to hide you
We could play Xbox and listen to "In Search Of..." and eat donuts
Over conversating 'bout what church does
Come up with weird-ass videos with roach bugs
I'm straight edge too, so no drugs on this trip
And Raquel that bitch, you should've killed that bitch
You should've took me instead (uhh, that's weird)
See, if you can't have her then he shouldn't neither
And if I can't have you then she shouldn't either
No one should see you, but me in your t-shirt
I worship you until the fucking wrinkles on my knees hurt (what the fuck)
Odd Future, Wolf Gang, Golf Wang, Flog Gnaw, free Earl mobbing
I know it seems like I'm just slobbing on your knob
But I'm just a fan and I ain't losing my fucking noggin (yeah, you are)
I ain't got a job and I went out and bought Goblin about 5 times
'Cause (Thanks for the support) I love you man (alright)
I like tie-dyed tees or just plain white tees
I like pants that's cut, I like words like "fuck"
I got your pics on my wall with the mouth cut out
Now paper cuts on my balls because your dick's in my jaw (what the fuck)
And I hit you on Twitter about 10 minutes a day
And now I'm bitter 'cause you don't even reply with a "hey" (sorry)
And my boys think I'm gay 'cause I play "VCR"
In my car all alone speakers waking up neighbors..."
All right, my nigga, calm down, it's getting weird, take this pic
So I can get on Colossus, line as slow as molasses
(Tyler, listen) No, nigga, I see you're loving my shit
And I appreciate the fact that you would suck on my dick
But I'm not gay so it's awkward, now I'm grouchy like Oscar
After spilling some shit on his newest pair of beige Dockers
"Yonkers" and "Yonkers" (I love that song) Sick of hearing about "Yonkers"
I'm grateful that it worked, I attacked and I conquered
"Yeah whatever but I had a fucking blast at that concert
I was at the Boston one, I got a t-shirt from Sagan
The one that say "Sagan Lockhart" and when you came out to "Sandwitches"
That's when my fucking boy-crush got started"

[Outro]
Just take this fucking picture man, shit...

[Verse 1: Tyler, The Creator]
Ayo
I wanna talk, I wanna call you and talk
I wanna walk to your front door and knock
After I start my vehicle
Drive to your city 'cause we live an hour apart
Land at your driveway and put it in park
Then do the third line of this verse
Then back to my house and we pack up our bikes
And we ride through the park, chase the sun
God, that's all I want, other than air
Oxygen and financial freedom, yeah
I want your company, I need your company
I want you to want from me
I can't maneuver without you next to me
It's so complex to me

[Verse 2: Tyler, The Creator]
What do you need?
Do you need bread? Do you need this?
Do you need a hug? Do you need to be alone?
I could wrap this up and get the fuck away instead
What is your wish? It can be granted
You're number one, one on my list, see, I am Santa
Where is Rudolph? You're parasitic
I do not have self-control
I am startin' to wonder
Is this my free will or yours? (Yours, yours, yours)

[Chorus: Tyler, The Creator & Kanye West]
I'm your puppet, you control me
I'm your puppet, I don't know me
(Did I wait too long?)
I'm your puppet
(Did I wait too long?)
You control me
(Did I wait too long?)
I'm your puppet
(Did I wait too long?)
I'm lonely
'Cause I'm your puppet
(Puppet, oh)
You control me (Control me)
I'm your puppet (Puppet)
I don't know
I'm your puppet (Did I wait too long?)
You control me (Puppet)

[Verse 3: Kanye West]
You lost, son, and you've been tryna find your way to me
Ayy, to me, he's on somethin' that I hate to see
A to Z, nah son, I'm gonna take a breathe
Run a 'thon, I just stop and I'ma take the breathe
...on a...
...on a...
First, light the weed
First...
First... (Got me by a string)
First... (Got me by a string)
First... (Got me by a string)
(Oh, Lord)

[Outro: Kanye West, Tyler, The Creator & Jerrod Carmichael]
(La, la, la, la)
(La, la, la)
Breathe on a song
(La, la, la)
Breathe on a song
(La, la, la, la, la, la)
Breathe on a song
(Cut me loose)
(La, la, la)
(La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la)
(Cut me loose, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
But at some point, you come to your senses

[Intro: Tyler, The Creator & Lil Uzi Vert]
What? What? What? What? What? What? What? What? What? What?
Uh!

[Intro]
Man, now they go (ayo)
I cut off some friends, where they go?
(Did this shit in one take, ayo)
I stick to the plan, that's the goal
(Ayy, we got that fire shit, nigga)
Fuck these niggas man (run it)

[Verse 1]
Check my bankroll, ayo, 400K for vehicle
Paintjob look like ashy ankles on Django, interior look mango
Shotgun grape, he look like mayo
Golden voice on payroll, neck all gold like Kayo Corp
We aim at dorks, get out the way, yo
Keep them bucks in banks like Yayo
Swampy niggas out the bayou
Pockets flooded, y'all be dilute
Watered down, I'm Big Mac
I'm quarter pound, you chicken nugget
Fuck it, travel bag Balenciaga, 30,000 just for luggage
Financial advisor buggin', Flower Boy is buzzin'
Grammy-nominated, tell yo' cousin ain't nobody fuckin' with him

[Chorus]
Man, now they go
I cut off some friends, where they go?
I stick to the plan, that's the goal
Fuck these niggas man, that's for sure

[Verse 2]
Say
Uno the shoe, red with the blue
Look like a flag, what the fuck it do?
Golf be the set, no more OF
Like Ron Artest, bitch, we aim for your neck
Give a fuck about you or your respect
Yeah, that way, fuck your accolades
But I made the cut like I pack a blade
You could call me Brush, I've been makin' waves
Since Ashley Banks' cousin had a fade
But that's '92, I'm '91 (hey!)
Watts Riot in my blood, nigga what's up
And that pussy pink like the drink in my cup
Lemonade, yeah it's Minute Maid
I been gettin' paid, pockets gainin' weight
Your bank statements on Mary Kate, but that's up to you

[Chorus]
Man, now they go
(I ain't fuckin' with none of these niggas, man)
I cut off some friends, where they go?
(Yeah, give these niggas information nigga)
I stick to the plan, that's the goal
(Now we never fuckin' stop)
Fuck these (ayo) niggas man, that's for sure (ayo)

[Verse 3]
Tell Tim Chalamet to come get at me
Skin glowin', clear of acne
Diamonds see-through, so holographic
Red Ones look like Aidan Mackey
Spent dinero like Taxi Driver
Handmade is that thing with tires
But I rode the bike and Vill tail behind me
And he got the Cannon like he bagged Mariah
(Pew, pew, pew, pew, pew)
Yeah, we straight but if you wrinkle up the situation he will go grab the iron
And he do what I says like Simon
(No violence)
And my bitch mixed like jambalaya
Man, fuck with the fam, we in Japan
Bitch you're a bum, see you don't understand
Yeah, I cut off some friends, "T where you been?"
Bitch I'm in Bel-Air, been lookin' for land
Need a spot in the hills, not the beach, need a pool
Just to cool it, I do need the grass, not the sand
Got enough rocks, see, check my hand
And I got crack, watch how I talk
And it's still Wolf Gang, bitch, watch how I bark
Wallace still trippin' on shit that I bought
But I really do not care the cost 'cause okra

[Outro]
Man, now they go
I cut off some friends

[Intro]
Say some more, never want to talk about it
Feel a way, woah
Feel a way, woah
Feel a way, November...

[Chorus]
Take me back to November
Take me back to November
Hawaiian shirts in the winter, cold water, cold water
Yeah, take me back to November, wassup
Can we go back to November?
Take me back to November
Hawaiian shirts in the winter, deep thoughts, deep thoughts
Naw, take me back to November, wassup

[Verse 1]
What if Clancy fuckin' me over?
What if "Who Dat Boy" is rhetorical and this shit is over?
What if I'm hustling backwards?
What if my accountant ain't payin' my taxes?
Fillin' his pockets and IRS show up asking me questions
I couldn't answer 'cause I was too busy tryna make classics
Boy ain't got no motherfucking classics
What if my music too weird for the masses?
And I'm only known for tweets more than beats or
All my day ones turn to three, fours 'cause of track seven
Fuck, what if I get stuck?
What if I got comfortable? I gotta keep it buck fifty
What if I lost it all and ended up back in Ladera
At them shitty apartments that's across the Bank of America
Damn, I would be hurtin'
Writing all of these songs cause Wi-Fi wasn't working
Last year in total, I put out two verses
But five-seven figures since then, life's kinda perfect
Oh is it really? Oh is it really? Bitch you know the dealy
Really hilly willy tilly silly, hold that billy how I Milly Rock
When they can't relate him, when they start to hate him
They don't drive these cars so what's their ultimatum?
Tell me, what's your November? Is it a person?
Mine was the summer '06, I remember the... (horn)
What if I thought the brake was the gas? What if I crashed?
What if these deep thoughts was my last?
Let me pull over, quick!

[Chorus]
And drive back to November
Take me back to November
Hawaiian shirts in the Winter, cold water, cold water
Yeah, take me back to November, wassup
Can we go back to November?
Take me back to November
Hawaiian shirts in the Winter, deep thoughts, deep thoughts
Naw, take me back to November, wassup

[Interlude: Jasper Dolphin, Taco, Kilo Kish, Christian Clancy, Syd, Lionel, Vince Staples, Julian Conesugra]
My November was those Odd Future Sundays, where we used to just skate all day
My November, and I was performing and Lil Wayne rapped with me, I think I cried that night
My November was awesome, I booked my first feature film
My November was when I was gifted this Getz and Gilberto album
My November was seeing Erykah Badu perform
My November was when my brother took me to first concert ever...
My November was summer 2015 when I fell in love with someone who fucked my whole world up, showed me life through a different
2014, Miami 43rd Street, every day was November

[Bridge]
Take me back, take me back
Take me back, take me back
Take me back, take me back, take me back
Take me back, take me back
Take me back, take me back
Take me back, take me back
Take me back, take me back, take me back
Take me back, take me back
I ain't doin' fine, lost my mothafuckin' mind
Time travel back and help me find
Take me back, take me back to November, this I know
Take me back, take me back
Take me back, take me back to November, this I know
"My November is right now"

[Verse 2]
I wrote a song about you, I want your opinion
Opposite of my heart rate, it slows down at the ending
'Cause the love I got for you has exceeded appearance, the lyrics are
Matter of fact, I'ma just call you, so you can hear it
If you do answer, I'll play it to state facts
Although I already know the response you gon' say back
At that point I'll hang up, disappear and just stay back
And if you don't I'll leave a voicemail with the playback

[Outro]
Hello, no one is available to take your call
Please leave a message after the tone
[beep]

[Verse 1: Tyler the Creator]
Ayo
Let's take it back to them days
Counting sheep on Sadie Hannah's floor
Carpet was my baby mama
80 dollar profit from the coffee I poured
Rent-A-Center calling everyday
Nobody home, they're knocking on the door
Now I skrrt, skrrt, skrrt, skrrt (Skrrt!)
In toys I only dreamed that I could afford
Now I roll through Okaga

[Chorus: Frank Ocean & Tyler the Creator]
I ride to California (Yeah)
These frog oval goggles
I'm leanin' out the window
OJ shinin' on me (Oh, ooh)
Simp sun shinin' on me (ayy, yeah)
Slick circles float roll
Out this world
Yeah, yeah

[Bridge: Tyler, The  Creator]
Run it, run it, run it, run it
I rock, I roll, I bloom, I grow (I grow)
I rock, I roll (What you say?), I bloom, I grow (I glow)
I rock, I roll (Let 'em know), I bloom, I grow (I glow)
I rock, I roll (One more time), I bloom, I grow
(Let's go!)

[Verse 2: Tyler, The Creator]
Ain't nobody fucking with T, but that just may be my ego
But don't be too cool, you might freeze
Because niggas get stuck in the cold (Man, look at this ice)
Shit weighs a ton
Water your garden, my nigga (Stunt on these niggas!)
Tell these black kids they could be who they are
Dye your hair blue, shit, I'll do it too (What the fuck?)
Look, I smell like Chanel
I never mall grip with my manicured nails
I coconut oil the skin
I keep the top low 'cause the follicles thinnin'
But other than that, man
It feels like I'm winning (I'm winnin', nigga)
Went from statistic to millionaire
CNN doubted 'cause my skin is dark
Then they forget when I get in my car

[Chorus: Frank Ocean]
These frog oval goggles
I'm leanin' out the window
OJ shinin' on me (Oh, ooh)
Simp sun shinin' on me
Slick circles roll float
Out this world
Yeah, yeah
Run it, run it, run it, yeah
(Ohh, ohh!)

[Bridge: Tyler, The  Creator]
I glow (I glow)
I rock, I roll (What you say?), I bloom, I grow (I glow)
I rock, I roll (Let 'em know), I bloom, I grow (I glow)
I rock, I roll (One more time), I bloom, I-
(Let's go!)

[Verse 3: Tyler, The Creator]
Flower boy T, nigga that's me
Rooted from the bottom, bloomed into a tree
Took a lil' while, nigga makin' leaves
Keep it in my branches so my family can eat
Favorite color green, energy is skrong
Giving niggas life, birdies and the beez
Droppin' them seeds, not what you want
You don't know what I keep in the trunk

[Interlude: Tyler, The Creator]
Ah, shit!

[Outro: Tyler, The Creator]
Ahh, ahh
Ahh
Run it, run it, run it, run it
Run it
Run it
Run it

[Intro]
Runnin' out of time, runnin' out of time, runnin' out of time
Runnin' out of time to make you love me
Runnin' out of time, runnin' out of time
To make you love me

[Verse 1]
Secrets
Oh, you spin my head around (Oh, you spin my head around)
I been lookin' for it (For it, for it)
I been runnin' out of spells
To make you love me
Secrets
Keep it up
To make you love me (Ah)
Wade in your water (Wade in your water)
Your waves wash over me
I drift to the deep end
Don't save, don't save, don't save
It's a low tide (I'll be fine)
I found peace in drownin'

[Chorus]
Runnin' out of time, runnin out of time, runnin' out of time
Runnin' out of time to make you love me

[Bridge]
Livin' in pretend
Keep it a buck fifty, fuck
Are you livin' in pretend?
Are you'

[Verse 2]
So
Take your mask off
I need her out the picture (Wade in your water)
Take your mask off (Yeah)
Stop lyin' for these niggas
Stop lyin' to yourself
I know the real you
Don't save, don't save, don't save
Halloween ain't for a minute, lose the costume
You need to chill, okay
Been runnin' from the targets and 'em back in the day
And now they working their all, another track out the DAW
Actin' a fool, actin' a ball, we packin' the park, yeah
But I'm still runnin'
Out of time

[Outro]
Of time, of time
Runnin' outta
Of time
Still runnin' outta
Of time
Still runnin' outta time
Time
Yeah

[Part I]

[Verse 1]
Turn my lights on
How the fuck you quiet with the mic on?
I don't get anxiety, you Sam Bowie-ass niggas
I just get my Mike on
Y'all said I wouldn't go nowhere, I took the detour
When you see the someone in the crack right by the seashore?
When you see them brand new le Fleurs on the floor?
If the cops ask my name, bitch, I'm Igor

[Chorus]
Yuh, ayo
Yeah, yeah
Let's go, let's go, I ain't playin' around
Red nose, red nose, all you niggas is clowns
Niggas turning it up, well, shit, I'm tearing it down
Hard to believe in God when there ain't no mirrors around
What's up?

[Bridge]
Uh-huh, ayo
Uh-huh
Yeah, yo
Bitch

[Verse 2]
Running 'til the rims fall
Had them niggas and the cops looking jigsaw
I done fucked around and turned into the big dog
Better get God, get caught? Bitch, I think not
Yeah, new suit, new boots, same nigga, like what?
Lukewarm-ass niggas always wanna talk
I'm hot, I'm heat to the core like Earth
Don't touch, don't go, niggas might get buck

[Chorus]
Yo, yuh, ayo
Yeah, yeah
Let's go, let's go, I ain't playin' around
Red nose, red nose, all you niggas is clowns
Niggas turning it up, well, shit, I'm tearing it down
Hard to believe in God when there ain't no mirrors around
What's up?

[Interlude]
Whoop, uh huh
Yeah, bitch
Yeah

[Part II]

[Intro: slowthai]
I see the light
Now didn't I tell you motherfuckers
Um, I see the light
To pay attention and to keep your motherfucking eyes glued to the man that's in front of you?
I see the light
That's what the fuck I expect all y'all motherfuckers to do
I see the light

[Verse 3: Tyler, The Creator & slowthai]
Dracula, Dracula, Dracula
Suck me first, I might get back at ya (I see the light)
Is that shit clear? Check the aperture
Hahahahaha, I can't laugh at ya (I see the light)
This the shit that make you nervous
'Bout to go buck wild, nigga, Steve Irwin (I see the light)
Sick of that 'Claren talk, I'm on my third one
Niggas talkin' reckless, I never heard 'em (I see the light)

[Chorus: slowthai]
I see the light
I see the light
I see the light
(Buck, don't touch, though, my niggas might get buck, don't touch, though)
I see the light
(Buck, don't touch, though, my niggas might get buck, don't touch, though)
I see the light

[Verse 4: Tyler, The Creator & slowthai]
That car crash couldn't take me (Woo, ha)
Green haired angels all around me (Uh)
No answer why, no tears to cry, bitch, I'm alive (I see the)
That wasn't my endpoint like v-neck
I ain't have nobody to cheat on, I cheat death
New album, no repeat, I reset
Everything I deliver special like G. Dep
Two of 'em, I total, Kima, Pam
Me and death, the universe played middle man
Quick nap, kick back like horse, eyes shut
Loud sound, no scratch
Motherfuckers really thought I died
Hoping they could take a spot
Nigga not knowing that I'm one of one
And they some Helen Keller-ass niggas
And I got my eyes open now I see the...

[Outro: slowthai & Jerrod Carmichael]
Light
I see the light
You never wanna meet a motherfucker like me
I see the light (I said)
I see the light
I see the light
I don't know what's harder, letting go or just being okay with it

[Intro: Shane Powers]
Right now we got some new music only here on Golf Radio!
(God I love this sample)
We're going to dance
And exercise
And have some fun

[Chorus]
I ain't got time for these niggas
Better throw a watch at the boy
Had my boys in this bitch, looking like a seminar
Who the fuck you talking to, motherfucker?
Boy, I ain't got time for these bitches
Better throw a clock at these hoes
Have these hoes in this bitch looking for a water hose
Who the fuck you talking to, motherfucker?
Boy, I ain't got time

[Verse 1]
Boy, I need a Kleenex
How I got this far? Boy, I can't believe it
That I got this car, so I take the scenic
Passenger a white boy, look like River Phoenix
First, happy birthday!
You bitch ass nigga, yup I'm thirsty
Them little shots that you threw, they ain't hurt me
I ain't fuck with you bitch ass in the first place

[Chorus]
I ain't got time for these niggas
Better throw a watch at the boy
Had my boys in this bitch, looking like a seminar
Who the fuck you talking to, motherfucker?
Boy, I ain't got time for these bitches
Better throw a clock at these hoes
Have these hoes in this bitch looking for a water hose
Who the fuck you talking to, motherfucker?
Boy, I ain't got time

[Verse 2]
Nat Turner would be so proud of me
'Cause all these motherfuckers got they style from me
I bet they all looking from the crowd at me
And if I ask them, they would bow at me
But you're a house nigga, so you don't know
How that shit go, with my big lips and my big nose
And my big dick and my short hair
'Cause you already know how slow my shit grow

[Bridge]
(Hey)
Tick, tock
Tick, tock
Tick, tock
Tick, tock

[Verse 3]
Been the man with a pickle plan, niggas know the dill
When I sell the carnival, I bet I get a 100 mil'
Next line will have 'em like "Whoa"
I've been kissing white boys since 2004
One me, two feet, three M's
Four, five, six years ago sucked
Seven figure conversations with Converse finalized
'Cause Vans fucked up
I'ma read commas, you gon' leave comments
Saying what I shoulda did, but you ain't did nada
You ain't important
I'ma keep sporting
All smiles over here
Shout out to The Garden
(Tick-tock)
(And that's a fact boy!)
And I just handle all my business like a chessboard
(Tick tock, tick, tock)
And at them Golf boys?
That's my motherfucking set, boy
Hard pill to swallow like some thick soda
Walk weird 'cause my pockets look like thick Yoda
With a Skywalker, riding 'round solar
Anakin skin Sprite, and my tint cola
Getting neck from abroad like some big shoulders
Till I bust like that 9 in ya heat holster
Everything I say is hot, bitch I speak toaster
And the bread orthodox like I eat kosher
Shout out to (shhh) they gave a big loaf of
Green bread, got me chilling like a clean sofa
What's that thick odor?
Young Millie T
A young, focused black boy, oh silly me
(I ain't got time!)

[Verse 4]
Better talk shit
'Cause I'm either in my Cons or my Golf shit
Pants got a lil flood, nigga pipe down
I'm Lil Boosie, Lil Boosie, way I wipe down
(Boy I ain't got time!)
Yeah right now
'Cause niggas dying every day and I ain't light brown
And i-D ain't wanna give a nigga no post
So I went and did a 12-page spread in Vogue
(Nigga I ain't got time!)

[Outro]
Listen, man, I'm that boy
All you little niggas clones
Boy I fill that void
You better kill that noise
Turn around and remap route
When they see that boy with them big ears and that gap tooth
Bitch
Tick, tock
Tick, tock
Tick, tock
Fuck, hello

[Intro]
Da na na na na, da na na na na
Da na na na na, my baby
You've been on my mind (How ya feel?)
I'm losing my mind because
I hope that we can be more than just friends

[Chorus]
Fireworks, I feel like glitter
And every time you come around, I feel like glitter (How ya feel?)
You're the one that I needed in my life (How ya feel?)
You're the one that I needed in my life

[Verse 1]
Ayo, mirror mirror on the wall, who the brightest of them all?
I never been the darkest one 'cause my self esteem is tall
So I never seen eye-to-eye with y'all niggas, ayo
Uno peso, never paid attention to what niggas gotta say-o
So I keep that buck, I ain't give no fuck
They ain't build me up so I block 'em like Lego
Feelin' glitter, feelin' good and great
Got the burner, got the heat, like wait
Got the shit, it's all up on that hip
I'll use it on myself on the day you dip
Got that 4, 5, 7, track 8 for me
Baby doll, I hope you agree
Because you light my

[Chorus]
Fireworks, I feel like glitter (I don't even know what that means)
And every time you come around, I feel like glitter
(How you feel?) You're the one that I needed in my life
(How you feel?) You're the one that I needed in my life
'Cause I love having you around (I love)
'Cause I love having you around

[Verse 2]
Yeah, look at my face, look at that joy
This is one sided, yeah, I can't lie
We ain't gon' work out, we a fat boy
Yeah, sumo, got it, memo
Pale skin see-through, must be a window
'Cause you ain't an L, could be a DJ
When I see you my heart beat changes tempo
Yeah, simple, that's what I want but I can't
That's who you are but I ain't (how ya feel?)
We can track 10 skiptrace, I'm caught in your quicksand, wait
Please don't save me

[Bridge]
Ooooh
(Please don't save me, yeah)
How ya feel?
(Rose tinted cheeks)
How ya feel?
How ya feel?
How ya feel?
How ya feel?
How ya feel?
(Scum Fuck Flower Boy)
How ya feel?
(Scum Fuck Flower Boy)
How ya feel?
(Scum Fuck Flower Boy)
How ya feel?
How ya feel?

[Outro]
We didn't get your message, either because you were not speaking or because of a bad connection
Fuck

[Verse 1]
Knock-knock, mothafucks, it's me, Mr. Clusterfuck
What, when, where, how, like who gives a fuck
Golf Wang M-O-B, mopping niggas ante up
Ain't been this fucking sick since brain cancer ate my Granny up
Rest in peace or lie in it, life ain't got no light in it
Darker than that closet that nigga Frankie was hiding in
Open it, dope in it, Bobby where's my fucking pipe?
Dress my little dick as Ike, twenty says I hit your wife
This is life, truthfully I just want to fly some kites
Grab Salem and Slater and go around, riding bikes
Get some ice cream, Golf Wang Roscoe's for the night
To skate around and do annoying shit that older peeps despise
Nigga fuck it though, going hard as riga mo
Got a nigga dollars and a couple cracker kids at shows
Cracked a couple kids in the head with this cast
Had a blast out in Europe, had a Swedish bitch licking toes
That's how it goes, designing clothes
Cats on everything, cats on everything
You think all this money will make a happy me?
But I'm 'bout as lonely as crackers that supermodels eat
Everybody's sparking but me, and I keep coughing
Can't keep calm in this spot's hot box and I'm getting nauseous
Hop in the car, ride to Saugus, and head straight to the office
Pissed off at Jasper because that's some faggot shit called "Pink Dolphin"
I roll here on a mean unicorn
Green hat, Vans, Golf top is the team uniform
Downing that Capri Sun, tighten my bandana up
Something like a lez, I'm forgetting my damn manners cause

[Chorus]
I am the cowboy on my own trip
And I am the cowboy on my own trip
And I am the cowboy on my own trip
And I am the cowboy

[Verse 2]
When you're alone thoughts start coming in
Punching in that dark lock box and they start rummaging
Shit you've got to battle with, wishing they could skedaddle
But it makes your shadow say none, fun and grab the gun again
I needed to get out of the house
So I hit the Dead Sams, and we went biking it out
In a black hoodie, with an Arizona and a bag of Skittles
Just to see what all that fucking hype is about
Now everytime you see a roach you think of me, ay?
Cause everytime I see one I think what his parents would say
In court saying I ate him, I wasn't present that day
I was with Whitney smoking, sitting at the dock of the bay

[Chorus]
I am the cowboy on my own trip
And I am the cowboy on my own trip
And I am the cowboy on my own trip
And I am the cowboy

[Verse 3]
Do you know how weird it is knowing I make a bunch of cheese
While my friends can't afford little pizzas from Little Caesars
And their whole goal is to roll up and smoke bowls
So I don't feel bad when they not eating
(But you still treating us, you punk bitch)
Wolf Haley got more methods than Pinkman
I'm never civil, fuck Lincoln, 'Preme out the bag it's no wrinkles
I'm okie dokie and loopy and booboo nana and caca
If you think I'm fucking koo-koo, try talking to my shrink then

[Skit: Tyler, The Creator as Dr. TC, Sam, and Wolf]
"Hey..."
"Bitch."
"I'm right here."
"Yo, who's that..?"
"That's Salem, that's my girlfriend. You stay the fuck away from her alright?"

[Chorus]
I am the cowboy on my own trip
And I am the cowboy on my own trip
And I am the cowboy on my own trip
And I am the cowboy

[Intro: Nas]
Crack fucked up the world
And I wonder if they realized the damage
I mean, they come from an era
Who made a lot of money off that shit
And I wonder if it fucked with they conscience
It fucked with me being out there, I couldn't stand it
I couldn't stand seeing people fucking theyselves up like that on the shit
And that's where the money came from

[Chorus: Tyler The Creator & Frank Ocean]
48, 48, 48 states I get it in (Nigga)
48, 48, 48 states I get it in (Nigga)
They call me Mr. Treat Your Nose
If you really need some blow, I can get it for the low, nigga
48, 48, 48 states I get it in (Nigga)
48, 48, 48 states I get it in (Nigga)
They call me Mr. Treat Your Nose
If you really need some blow, I can get it for the low, nigga

[Verse 1: Tyler, The Creator]
Shit's getting warmer, on that corner
Gotta watch out for them 5-0 foreigners
Your mother's a goner
I warned you before you supersized my fries with that dollar
You got a daughter, shit's getting harder
The only thing you wanna bunk her was your freedom
You can't afford to get caught up but you in too deep
And the seashore ain't saw ya
You got a mother, she don't support you
But you bought her a new house cause you love her
Growing up you barely had a roof
Now you got a coupe and it doesn't have a roof
I guess you're accustomed what you're used to
So you bought two, nigga
They coming for you, nigga
Niggas be hating I'm doing them bitches
Like Susan and Karen be doing your pockets
And running the man and he's losing his fucking mind
And it's all an illusion
Who was alludin' all of this potent?
I am the reason your family is using and shooting up
It's my fault
You can, blame me, motherfucker
For killing your aunties and uncles
The hustle and hunger
All I wanted was a cheeseburger
And a little chain, tucked
Didn't realize this game fucked, up some lives
Oh, how's mine?
My conscience eats it up all the time but, other than that I'm fine
I got a little money in my pocket

[Chorus: Tyler The Creator & Frank Ocean]
48, 48, 48 states I get it in (Nigga)
48, 48, 48 states I get it in (Nigga)
They call me Mr. Treat Your Nose
If you really need some blow, I can get it for the low, nigga
48, 48, 48 states I get it in (Nigga)
48, 48, 48 states I get it in (Nigga)
They call me Mr. Treat Your Nose
If you really need some blow, I can get it for the low, nigga

[Verse 2: Tyler, The Creator]
Nigga, we broke as fuck
Homie got a chop shop, I stole that truck
And I sold that dope, motherfuckers hope this nigga go broke
But like my work I give no fucks, I'm sorry (Yeah)
She could have been a doctor, nigga, I'm sorry (Yeah, nigga)
Could have been an actor and won that Oscar, said I'm sorry
I sold that soul, and I killed black folk, I'm sorry (Yeah, nigga)
But I got a nice car, put my sister through school
While my mama all cool, I'm sorry (Yeah, nigga)
I'm in too deep and I can't see the shore, I'm sorry

[Outro: Nas & Tyler, The Creator]
You get addicted to the flip, we used to call it
You get addicted to the flip (I'm sorry)
The, the, the, the transaction, the hustling (I'm sorry)
Even more than the money, it's just your job (I'm sorry)
You feel like it's your duty to be the man in between the man
And make this happen for that person (I'm sorry)
And to do this and do that
You become the go to guy forever
Next thing you know you're in too deep
Way too deep, it'll scare the shit out of you
You wind up with so much work, that you'd be scared to death
It's important for us to realize man, we gotta get out of that, man
You know, dudes is buying choppers
Shoot down the people that look just like them
Dudes is buying guns to take down each other
Nobody wins, ya know what I mean?

Where your ass was at, dog, when niggas wouldn't feed me?
Where your ass was at, dog, when bitches didn't need me?
Where your ass was at, dog, when niggas tried to run off?
Where your ass was at, dog? You made me pull this gun out

[Verse 1: Future]
Where your ass was at, dog, you went and switched sides?
Where your ass was at, dog, when niggas spread lies on him?
Where your ass was at, dog, when the bodies came sliding?
Where your ass was at, dog, when I was serving pies?

[Chorus: Future]
Where your ass was at, dog, when niggas wouldn't feed me?

Where your ass was at, dog, when I was in the Pyrex?
Where your ass was at, dog, when I was drinking Hi-Tech?
Where your ass was at, dog? You came through the projects
Where your ass at? We keep that fully loaded contracts
Had her rain dance on the dick, ass jumping
Running through the pussy like a nigga going jogging
Fuck a little Louis, put it in a bitch pocket
Put a pic with me on the 'gram, now you popping
Where your ass was at when I was trapping in the store?
Had to struggle to get where I'm at and sell dope
Jackie Chan moves got game in the choke
Gas rolling up in the blunt, Amoco
12 tryin' come in the spot to open up the dope
Burglar bar doors got a young nigga confident
Juugin' out the stove and we still bangin', honest
Blowing on the O, yo, we call that ho an onion

[Verse 3: Drake]
Man, where your ass was at when we took the city over?
Where your ass was at when all they'd ask was "what's the hold up?"
Where your ass was at when niggas first got the news?
Now your ass around because we're paying back dues
Where were you when all the dogs needed help?
Lawyers and the commissary ain't gon' pay itself
Where your ass was at when we recorded in the bathroom?
Where your ass was at? I take attendance like a classroom
Man I ain't got no choice
'Cause nowadays I swear this shit done changed up for the boy
I'm self-made, selfish with my women, self-employed
I'll buy the neighbor's house if they complain about the noise
Man, where your ass was at, dog, when niggas wouldn't feed me?
Where your ass was at, dog, when bitches didn't need me?
Where your ass was at? Last winter was the coldest
Fuck where you was at, I had the 6 on my shoulders

[Chorus: Future]
Where your ass was at dog, when niggas wouldn't feed me?
Where your ass was at dog, when bitches didn't need me?
Where your ass was at dog, when niggas tried to run off?
Where your ass was at dog? You made me pull this gun out

[Verse 4: Future]
60 for a walk through, bitch don't panic
Had them bitches fall through fucking like a savage
Heard you tryna swim in the ocean no jacket
Heard that nigga came through squeezing on a ratchet
Heard that nigga came through squeezing on a ratchet
Serve a lot of dog food, call you a mutt
Where your ass was at dog, when I was on my come-up?
The reason I'm here today 'cause I ain't never gave up

[Chorus: Future]
Where your ass was at, dog, when niggas wouldn't feed me?
Where your ass was at, dog, when bitches didn't need me?
Where your ass was at, dog, when niggas tried to run off?

Now I'm gunnin' in the Benz and the Range too
I'm on point, know a nigga never take two
They said I couldn't reach Mars, so I turned to a star
Now I might have fucked around, might have raised up the bar
Now I'm talkin' cash, talk cash all in my palm
My nigga Cash said, "Watch what they do for the ones"
I know she wanna be poppin' all over the 'Gram
When the cameras come out, wanna hold my hand
Must be out of your mind, do you know who I am?
Man you're killin' my vibe, do you know who I am?

Make you fall in love tonight, must don't know who I am, I am

Bodies droppin' and we duckin' the law
If you the one to take the blame, you can't say what you saw, no

Shameless, I've been rockin' all my chains too (keep comin')
Told me, "Boy I think the money startin' to change you"
Lord save you, Lord save you
They might pick you up, just throw you down with the fall
You must not know who I am
You must not know who I am
I pour champagne on the ground

My brother Casino said you wasn't Freebandz (Freebandz)
And at the time I couldn't see what he was sayin' (he was sayin')
You turned your back, I should have never gave you chances (gave you chances)

I'm a boss, I'ma make my own family (la familia)
You're with my ex, while I'm with different color candies

You try to sneak and leave 'em then I leave you stranded

Get to fuckin' on the dresser just to make that pussy wetter
Gotta put you in that vintage then you rockin' Perry Ellis
Then I leave with you, only cause I believe in you
We get to bangin' on the walls just to piss the neighbors off
You and them 12 foot ceilings, I just painted the halls
So I can breathe with you
I want to live my dream with you
You say that money don't matter it's the times and the memories
And now that ass gettin' fatter and I know it's because of me
I know it's because of me
I know it's because of me, got you in custody
Whoever knockin' at the door, they gotta wait 'til we finished
I know I started at the bottom but that ain't where we endin'

You the number one trophy wife
So it's only right to live the trophy life
You grew up on J. Lo, Timberlands by Manolo now
'Til one day I put an angel in your ultrasound
I wanna dip that ass in gold, I wanna dip that ass in gold
I made it over NBA, NFL players
So every time I score it's like the Super Bowl
Baby, we should hit the south of France
So you could run around without them pants
I put that glacier on your little hand
Now that's the only thing without a tan
My trophy on that Bound bike, I gave you only pipe
If people don't hate then it won't be right
You could look at Kylie, Kendall, Kourtney and Khloe
All your Mama ever made was trophies, right?

[Chorus: Future]

Dirty soda, Spike Lee
White girl, Ice T
Fully loaded AP, yeah

[Chorus]
I just fucked your bitch in some Gucci flip flops
I just had some bitches and I made 'em lip lock
I just took a piss and I seen codeine coming out
We got purple Actavis, I thought it was a drought

[Verse 1]
Bitch, I'ma choose the dirty over you
You know I ain't scared to lose you
They don't like it when you're telling the truth
I'd rather be realer than you
I had to make me a cot
Now I called a contractor to make me a spot
I sold the dope out your house
Now you come to my house, I've got dope in the couch
You know I don't fuck with no rumors
Rocking red bottoms like they Pumas
Got these meds on me, I'ma do 'em
I take these pills and I'm having a thrill
Taking prescription's a hell of a feeling
As for the xanny, I never forgot it
Got 'em begging to call up my phone tryna have a menage
Gotta put up the cash, can't even stay in the house
Cause there's too much too hide
Whip the four to a nine, gotta pay up the rent, I was too far behind
Fuck I'm too out of time, fuck 'em two at a time
Had to do what I had to do to get where I'm at, niggas know I ain't lying
Niggas know I ain't lying
It's a lot on my mind, it's a lot on my plate
But I never complain
I was working the weight like I came out the gym
I never did train
Put the girl on a train
Strapped a bird on her back, now she came back with change

[Chorus]
I just fucked your bitch in some Gucci flip flops
I just had some bitches and I made 'em lip lock
I just took a piss and I seen codeine coming out
We got purple Actavis, I thought it was a drought
I just fucked your bitch in some Gucci flip flops
I just had some bitches and I made 'em lip lock
I just took a piss and I seen codeine coming out
We got purple Actavis, I thought it was a drought

[Verse 2]
I strapped the dope to your spouse
The first time I gave her an ounce
I put some free bands in her account
I told her, "Bitch, can't be running your mouth
Better watch what you say to these niggas
Cause you already know what they 'bout"
Put the game in a choke in a knot
Hit that bitch while I'm choking her out
Put that hook on her, now she got love in the south
I got some purp on me now
Stacking these styrofoams up by the double
They done let me back in, now they know they in trouble
Valet the whip by the front door
On a percocet now and I need me some more
Tell me them lies that you want me to hear
I try to forget, but it's hard to forgive
Take me some codeine and pop me a pill
I pull on a blunt and blow smoke out my ears
I smoke on this blunt, I get high as I can
I float off the Earth in designer
I'm working on having some manners
I'm thinking about it right now
I'm holding the cash while I pour up the lean
Then I put one in the air

[Chorus]
I just fucked your bitch in some Gucci flip flops
I just had some bitches and I made 'em lip lock
I just took a piss and I seen codeine coming out
We got purple Actavis, I thought it was a drought
I just fucked your bitch in some Gucci flip flops
I just had some bitches and I made 'em lip lock
I just took a piss and I seen codeine coming out
We got purple Actavis, I thought it was a drought

[Outro]
Thought it was a drought, thought it, thought it was a drought
We thought it was a drought, we poured an Actavis
Bitch, I'ma choose the dirty over you
You know I ain't scared to lose you
They don't like it when you're telling the truth
I'd rather be realer than you

(8-8-8-8-808 Mafia)

[Refrain]
Pour that bubbly
Drink that muddy, drink is muddy when we covered in it
Yeah, I'm covered in it
I was thuggin' it, I was just loving lit
That's for them other niggas, that's for the other bitches
That ain't for you, dawg, that's for them other niggas
That ain't for you, shawty, that's for that other bitch
I'm going crazy 'bout it, I'm going codeine crazy
That's how I'm living it, I'm feeling lovely
I'm drinking bubbly
I'm drinking bubbly (Yeah)

[Verse 1]
Take all my problems and drink out the bottle and fuck on a model, yeah
Audemar, this not a carnival, this is a Royal Oak Cartier
Dom Perignon, I get down from a brown, I get chauffeured around
I pour up with my rounds, I pour up out of town
I corrupted your town with them guns and them pounds
I grew up on the grounds with them dealers and hounds
We order more bottles and fuck on more models and pass 'em around
I say everything triple time
Rollie, AP, Hublot, triple time
I just know the ones you call upon
I just had to pay my dawg a bond
Looking at me like a triple threat
Every time a nigga talk, a check
Smoke the kush up like a cigarette
Run it back, you hear my intellect (8-8-8-8-808 Mafia)

[Bridge]
Celebrating like the championship
Celebrating like the championship

I told you, I told you, I told you, I told you
Hahah, celebrate

[Verse 2]
Don't tell me you celibate to the mula
I just went Rick the Ruler with the jeweler
I just went St. Tropez-in' like a goonie
Abu Dhabi, nigga straight out the sewer
Like a loaded chopper, I'm 'bout to shoot it
I'm so fucking sick and tired of these rumors
I just dived inside a cutie, we spoonin'
Take it back and take a look at yourself
Take the lesson, put it all in the air
Too many days gone by
Sittin' by the phone, waitin' 'til I reply
Drying my eyes, believe it or not
I could never see a tear fallin'
Water drippin' on me like a faucet
I just took a bitch to eat at Chipotle
Spent another sixty thousand on a Rollie
All my diamonds got you brainwashed
She sucked my dick, it got my brain washed
And for that shit, you got your man popped
See what they did to Biggie and Pac
Pour a lil', lil' liquor out, pour a lil' more liquor out
Pour it out, pour it out, pour it out

[Chorus]
Codeine crazy, codeine crazy
Codeine crazy, codeine crazy
Codeine crazy, codeine crazy
All this motherfucking money got me codeine crazy

[Verse 3]
Drownin' in Actavis, suicide
When I hit the scene, it's homicide
Diamond pinky ring a lollipop
Fuck the hate, I pull up in a drop
Diamonds colder than a glacier
Ballin' harder than the Pacers
I been tryin' to have some patience
Told my mama she should pray on it
Told the streets they gotta wait on it
She gon' put a nigga name on it
I just dropped a whole thang on it
I'm making USD's overseas
That's U.S. dollars that you can't achieve
Fucked my white girl, she said, "Nigga, please"
Fuck that white girl, she said, "Nigga, please"
Playin' poker, now we're back in Stroker
I forgot her name but her pussy soakin'
When I seen her on the pole
Reminded myself when I used to come over
Reminded myself when I used to get loaded
Remindin' myself that I'm still gettin' loaded
The coupe fully loaded, this whip fully loaded
This whip fully loaded, the clip fully loaded
I try to control it
Let's wrap up some bottles, let's pop off some bottles, these niggas too bogus
Let's pour up a pint, I'ma fuck around, faint like I'm Kid Cudi, probably
I fuck around, faint, I'ma fall on the drank
Rockin' Tom Ford, poppin' mollies
Married to this motherfuckin' money

[Chorus]
Codeine crazy, codeine crazy
Codeine crazy, codeine crazy
Codeine crazy, codeine crazy
All this motherfucking money got me codeine crazy

[Verse 4]
You thought I forgot about us?
I know that you know I don't fold under pressure
I'm back on the road, I get low on the pedal
We live by the codes of the ghetto
I'm closing this out with my memo
I'm treating this shit like a demo
I'm putting my heart and my soul in this shit and some more
I'm in that Dolce Gabbana
I might get after Madonna
I get it crack in the summer
Strapped in the 'Lac and the Hummer
Fronted a pack to my partner
All this lingo got her panties to dropping
Fuck the fame, I'm sipping lean when I'm driving
All this cash and it ain't nowhere to hide it
I'm an addict and I can't even hide it
Don't you panic, panoramic companion
They was tryna serve me at the arraignment
Never comment on it, never complaining
I'm taking everything that come with these millions
I'm taking everything that come with my children
Yeah, yeah

[Refrain]
Pour that bubbly
Drink that muddy, drink is muddy when we covered in it
Yeah, I'm covered in it
I was thuggin' it, I was just loving lit
That's for them other niggas, that's for the other bitches
That ain't for you, dawg, that's for them other niggas
That ain't for you, shawty, that's for that other bitch
I'm going crazy 'bout it, I'm going codeine crazy
That's how I'm living it, I'm feeling lovely
I'm drinking bubbly

Tell me that I don't deserve to ball
Well, then tell me who deserve it
Eyes getting low but I'm still observing, I see you lurking
Never see me out in person, I'm always working
Money on your head if you make a nigga nervous
Never made a move out here unless I was certain
Tatted on me, but this shit is deeper than the surface
I'm with everyone that I was here with in the first place
Making sure that they all good before they close the curtain

Weighed 1008 grams on the scale
I got a lower case T across my chest
Your crack house doin' numbers then you blessed
You move your momma to a crib from the 'jects
It's so much alcohol and kush on my breath
We prayin' five times a day to catch a plug
A few bean pies stashed in the trunk
Shoot dice all day and sell dust
You loaded up, they talkin' shit, you gone bust
Told yourself a million times, you don't give a fuck
Sold over a million dimes, hangin' in the cut
Sold over a million dimes, I don't give a fuck
What?

Hasta Ia-la-uego wake up with that Glock, okay though
Stash the dope inside a Winnebago in Decatur
You got your work, you posted up in the hood Bodega
Lil' woadie loading up that yopper before he brush his teeth
Gotta roll a backwood up while he count the cheese
We on the turf, getting active on the backstreet
I'm drinkin' Actavis, the only thing that relax me
I'm on drugs, every single day I pop a seal
We talk that lingo 'round here, we try to work a deal
You pull up round here, they serve you here to Dixie Hills
You hit Old Nat, I know on Godby you'll see a trap house
Gotta cock it back, out here this shit wid-ild

Keepin' it soft like a mink
Gold on my link, coke in the sink
Choppin' that work like karate
Servin' a new Maserati, in a brand new Maserati
That's a whole lot of new money
Snatch it, then hide it from the 12
Movin' them squares and them bales
Servin' the rawest of yayo
Beating that china like Kunta Kinte
Whippin' it, whippin' that fish and Parkay
Drinkin' on syrup, I'm rollin' up haze
Made myself a boss, a boss and a plug
Either way you put it, nigga, I'm good
Triple salute, nigga, straight out the hood

Young enough to still sell dope
But old enough that I knows better
When they sayin' it's 42 for that white powder, I knows better
Get it, nigga? I nose better, put a smile on the devil's face
Who don't wanna sell dope forever
And flood their Rollie till the bezel break?
Woo! Fish scale in the two-door that I fish-tails
Fiberglass, Ferrari leather, in designer shit that I misspell
YUGHH! Look at the clues
The J's, the jewels, I'm actin' a monkey
From 16 years old, I'm whippin' in kitchens, fuckin' my junkies

Toss a kilo like a free throw, crack house, it had the peephole

Me, I try to leave the best for later
But Pusha tried to put me on the respirator
The old Skateboard P, that's your favorite
Me and twenty girls doin' yoga naked
Frequency high, like a spaceship
She say that she like it and she's been exposed
The Gandalf hat and the weird ass clothes
That's Comme des Gar'ons and the Buffalo
I know guerrillas with the triggers that's on a banana clip
And packin' with the biggest missiles
These niggas is knocking over vehicles
These niggas ain't waitin' just to see niggas
These niggas ain't tryna hear plea niggas
These niggas like choppin' down trees, niggas
These niggas 1-2-3 and they squeeze, niggas
These niggas hit the weed then they lean niggas, gee, nigga
If you got two hoes, you need to let one go
Two Lambos, you need to let one go
All these drones while y'all smoke dro
There's an eye in the sky, I'm tryna let y'all know
Ain't no standards, I'ma set one though
Big ass bag but no man sandals
All that war, we need to let that go
That boom business, I'ma get that ho

Young nigga got that coke, whip that dope like a bad child
How you think about that coupe, with no roof?
Young nigga cashed out
Popped so many Percs, popped so many Xans
Young nigga 'bout to pass out
12 jump behind me, I got some in the car
Young nigga 'bout to smash out
Migo hit that line, say he got some bricks
Young fresh, 'bout to buy 'em out
QuikTrip 'round the corner, dropped a nine
Got the J's in the lunch line smokin' iron
Cocaine, cocaine cowboy, like Mickey Munday
Take over the project, whip a line, me no wait
I keep a .45 in my coat, while I'm servin' dope
The J's in my hood smoke that crack, say it give 'em hope
Serve a nigga whole brick, he hopin' that it come and go
Young nigga tricked up
Now he spendin' that money with Casino!

They say my whole hood got it under investigation
They know they talk that stick talk, that stick talk
They know we talk that lick talk, that lick talk

[Chorus]
10 million dollars cash, fuck a friend
Started sipping syrup, I've been geeked ever since
Gotta keep that heat on the seat ever since
You know we talk that stick talk, that stick talk
I'm 'bout to fuck this cash up on a new toy
'Bout to fuck this cash up on a new toy
You can't understand us 'cause you're too soft
Taliban bands, run 'em straight through the machinery

[Verse 1]
They came through with a stick and you heard it
They came through in this bitch and they were swerving
I can't believe the blood ain't on my shirt
Because he got hit close-range
We be talking stick talk, we be talking bricks too
We be talking lick talk, and I'ma fuck your bitch too
I ain't got no manners for no sluts
I'ma put my thumb in her butt

I'ma tell a lie under oath
I can see it in your eyes, you're going broke
Oxycontin got her with a body count (sak pase)
Riding in a car I barely can pronounce
Ordered up a chauffeur, told him, "ride me round the whole world"
I was on the E-way with that molly and that old girl
Get a little cheaper, you could win
Hit it little harder, get the Benz

[Chorus]
10 million dollars cash, fuck a friend
Started sipping syrup, I've been geeked ever since
Gotta keep that heat on the seat ever since
You know we talk that stick talk, that stick talk

Fucking with my niggas, I'll smoke a zip
Red eyes, and I got them Zoes with me
Taliban bands, run 'em straight through the machinery

They say my whole hood got it under investigation
They know they talk that stick talk, that stick talk

Crime rate's goin' crazy, crazy

Couple commas, made a purchase
Caught the wave, I ain't surfin'
Caught the wave, I ain't surfin

You do what you want once you cop it
You do what you want when you got it, yeah

You do what you want when you got it

[Refrain: Future]
I be on syrup, they know it
Stack up some money then blow it
I do what I want and I spazz
Take the styrofoam, pour the syrup up
It's a dress code, but it ain't for us

[Verse 1: Future]
Do what you want when you poppin', don't fold up
When I'm feelin' the stress, then I pour up
Reppin' the set like a soldier
Hop out the Bentley and roll up
I wasn't splurging on purpose
You lame niggas makin' me nervous
I'm keepin' the banger like Birdie
Sip out my cup and it's dirty

[Chorus: Future]
First I got married to money
Then I fell in love with that dirty
First I got married to money

I get love way in Jersey
Crime rate's goin' crazy, crazy
Cause my young niggas so thirsty
Couple commas, made a purchase

[Verse 2: Future]
I like the smell of that money when it burn
Bitch, you know a nigga poppin', wait your turn
I make so much money, it's got me delirious
When your gang gangs in the chain gang, this shit serious
I gotta maintain, I'm superior, nigga
I rep the same gang on account of my niggas
We fill up two planes on account of these riches
I fuck up some loose change on account of these bitches

[Refrain: Future]
I be on syrup, they know it
Stack up some money then blow it

Take the styrofoam, pour the syrup up

I know your true feelings ain't
They couldn't be here, you hear me?
They gotta be somewhere else

[Chorus]
I ain't worryin' 'bout no fucking, I ain't worried 'bout no fucking
Does sexing on the late night mean that much to you?
My love don't mean that much to you
Fucking these hoes meant too damn much to you
I just hope when you fucking on that nigga, when you finished
He can say that he love you
Now do you feel better 'bout yourself?
Do you feel better by yourself?
Did you feel better when I left?
Mark my words, I'ma ball without you
I came home last night to a m'nage
Got my dick sucked and I was thinking about you
I was fucking on a slut and I was thinking about you
When you fucking on that nigga, hope you thinking about me
When you laying with that nigga, hope you thinking about me
'Cause I'm thinking about you

[Refrain]
Go'n fuck that nigga, get it over with
Go'n fuck that nigga, get it over with

I want you to fuck him in paradise
'Cause I wanna be in your head tonight
If loving me in public ain't safe
You can take my love and hide it
Don't give up on me today
Hold on to me like a true love
I told you it was a true love
I ended up with temptations
You goin' out the country
You posting up on IG
I'm laid up with my sidepiece
The one that text while you was right there laying up beside me
Now tell me you don't want me
Tell me that the pussy ain't mines no more
Tell me you moving on and you don't love me no more
Monster

[Chorus]
I ain't worryin' 'bout no fucking, I ain't worried 'bout no fucking
Does sexing on the late night mean that much to you?
My love don't mean that much to you
Fucking these hoes meant too damn much to you
I just hope when you fucking on that nigga, when you finished
He can say that he love you
Now do you feel better 'bout yourself?
Do you feel better by yourself?
Did you feel better when I left?
Mark my words, I'ma ball without you
I came home last night to a m'nage
Got my dick sucked and I was thinking about you
I was fucking on a slut and I was thinking about you
When you fucking on that nigga, hope you thinking about me

Nothin' ever stopped you
From showin' your progression suddenly

Broken lies
Driving backwards
Making all the wrong turns
Saying all the wrong words
Dodging angels

[Pre-Chorus: Future & Rihanna]
Oh, let's not be alone

Empty thoughts fill the room
Breathe for me and I'll breathe for you

25 karats cost a mansion
Gold rose petals, bottle standin'
Came from the concrete, takin' chances
Pop gold Ace like a Xanny
I just need the blessin' from your family
Broken lies
Ain't no love without us
It will die
Roses turn into dust
Every night
We gettin' more popular
Wrong is right
When it comes to us

[Chorus: Future & Rihanna]
Oh, let's not be alone
Let's not be alone
Tonight, let's be selfish

And I keep a pint of cup of purple like Whoopi
And I keep the stainless steel on me like shoes
They got me going way harder then we can't lose
I had the conversation cause these niggas ain't true
I know you credit card frauds gangs bustin' some moves
I hope you're stacking money to the ceiling out the roof
I hope you don't catch no feelings
For your bitch who fucked the crew
You know I'm independent get the 'rillo bust a jug
You know that purple reign had them hitters on foot
I see you acting strange I can tell this ain't love
That brand new Mulsanne had to get it out the mud
Purple reign, purple reign is understood

Purple reign, purple reign, purple reign, purple reign, purple-
I just need my girlfriend

I just need-

[Verse 2]

I bought a couple Hublots like I'm pushing heroin
I bought a couple coupes, I bought a couple Panameras
I'm acting like a Freeband Gang terrorist
Red cup of lean, don't approach me like a junkie
Take a pledge to the team, we gon' kill and get money
International we taking over all the countries
Any nationality they coming, baby, coming
Ride shotgun in the foreign that's a Rover
Until you gun down we gon' never have closure
Got real estate downtown, investing all over
I heard you're trying to talk down like I ain't focused
I know you tryna play around like I ain't got soldiers
Big cup of syrup washing down all my doja
Wearing Louis loafers like they old penny loafers
Started off local got the cribs bi-coastal
I don't want no words with you 'cause you mad bogus
I'm just tryna motivate the hoods all over (The coolest DJ in the world)
I'm just tryna teach you how to get these whips loaded
I'm just tryna show you how to get a few Rollies

Hope I didn't come at you the wrong way, that wasn't planned
Hope you see the path that I made, I took a chance
I just put my passion and drive into this
Two cups of that dirty, take a dab, blow kush
And we ain't gonna talk about it
Cut you off if you keep pushing
Since I got the fame can't forget I was crooked
They wanna see me make the wrong move, bite the bullet
See me whip up in that new school just like a bullet

[Chorus 2]
Purple reign, purple-

Back in the day, when a nigga sell dope

My ambitions as a rider
Sippin' on lean, getting higher
Nigga, I'm a codeine buyer

Shout out to the shooters and the shooters only
You never walk around with a lot of money
Hundred dollars fallin' all out your pocket
When you hit 'em in the head, can you keep it solid?
Bulletproof whip, we'll blow it up
Like some raw uncut dope, blow it up
Represent your gang, nigga, throw it up

Presidential Rollie and it's glidin'
Love a nigga wrist when it's shinin'
Hate a nigga wrist when it's blingin'
So I went and added more diamonds
Hot Boy, nigga, BG
That's the way these young niggas eat
Drinking on syrup, can't sleep
Keep it copacetic with your partner
Blockbuster niggas running 'round with real choppers
Nigga, what's the color of them bottles? they ain't gold
And you moving 'round with ya ho
You ain't even sticking to the code
Pimps up, pimps up, Hoes down (Hoes down)
A pool full of money and I'm 'bout to drown
I'ma fool on the corner with that Bobby Brown
Button up suits at the Grammys
Had to turn it up for the family
Yes, I'm a Freeband bandit

[Chorus]
Talkin' 'bout you poppin' tags, nigga, you ain't bought shit
Talkin' 'bout a hunnid bottles, nigga, you ain't popped shit

Is that her in the VIP-line
With the Vuitton and Yves Saint Laurent
Used to drive a Nissan now she in a Beamer
I don't want 'er cause she from the corner
And I heard that Beamer was a loaner
Her old man, the owner
And don't even drink Carona's
What type of drink you want bruh
On champagne forever
On dirty sprite forever
You can come sip with me
If you'd like to change the weather
If you wanna live better
We can buy a crib, where ever
Don't get too thirsty, get used to the cheddar
I wanna tell the world about you just so they can get jealous
And if you see 'er 'fore I do tell 'er I wish that I've met 'er

[Hook]
Turn on the lights

Hangin' with the dope boys in the hallways
And I know, to keep 'er, yeah you gotta get that pay
Turn on the lights
I'm lookin' for 'er too
I heard she got a pretty face and stand up like a stallion
I heard that she a precious jewel, you treat her to medallions
I wanna be the one to find out if I go to prowlin
And if I get her number, you know I can't wait to dial it
And if we get together, girl, you know we gon be wildin
And when we get together we make magic and it's ours
Whenever you up here, ain't nun nobody can do about it

She a hood girl
But she a good girl
She been mislead
Now she ready for the world
I want your energy
To take control of me
I've tried to go to sleep
And seen 'er in my dreams
Just in case I run across her today I'mma stay clean
Just in case you recognize her face, send 'er to me
And tell 'er I've been lookin' for 'er with a flashlight
You can't tell a nigga nothin because I got my cash right
And tell 'er if she honest I promise to stay true
Make sure, when you tell 'er, tell 'er we goin past the moon

I think fifty-six nights crazy
I think fifty-six nights crazy
I think me and Esco crazy
I think me and Young Sco' crazy
I did fifty-six broads on the European tour and they was all crazy
I did fifty-six broads on the European tour and they was all crazy
I took fifty-six bars all in one month nigga and I'm still dranking
I could still see the scar on a nigga hand, man this shit real crazy
I been taking these molly's, still nodding off 'cause a nigga too faded
I've been laying low key inside a nigga vault, money is my motivation

[Verse 1]
Money keep a nigga motivated
Molly keep a nigga motivated
Percocet keep 'em motivated
Good drank keep a nigga motivated
Lortabs on my conversation
Talk a lot of bands then we conversatin'
I was on my way to Rice Street
In the paddie wagon and it had me numb
The pain from the slum had me numb
Tryna sell some dope and eat caviar
Got the passport in Saudi Arabia
We've been flossing in medallions
We ain't nothing but some Talibans
I pull up right now and embarrass ya
I've just been hanging with savages
Lately I've been hanging around with my savages
I grew up on the block, one hunnid
I go on The Bluff, it's one hunnid
I done did enough in the jungle
I done put in some work and they love me
When I drink out the cup, it's so dirty
Had the blow at the store, they was lurking
Poured a four in a cup it was breakfast
Sprinkled sauce in my drink and I took it

[Chorus]
I think fifty-six nights crazy
I think fifty-six nights crazy
I think me and Esco crazy
I think me and Young Sco' crazy
I did fifty-six broads on the European tour and they was all crazy
I did fifty-six broads on the European tour and they was all crazy
I took fifty-six bars all in one month nigga and I'm still dranking
I could still see the scar on a nigga hand, man this shit real crazy
I been taking these molly's, still nodding off 'cause a nigga too faded
I've been laying low key inside a nigga vault, money is my motivation

[Verse 2]
Promethazine took my concentration
To another level then I elevated
Diamonds hanging on me I'm intoxicated
Diamonds hanging off me I'm intoxicated
Chop it up with a sack chaser
Told you I wasn't going back, baby
Hanging out with some crack babies
Fell in love with this cash baby
Money touch a niggas hands
On a few Xans might won't count it
Spend it all in one night
If we could rewind it, we'll still do it
I'm true to this game, I jump on a plane
And run to the stage
I've been working some years for this
Making music, I live for this
Hit the trap in my Louboutins
Count it up then I bag up a brick
Mount it up then I smash out in it
You know I'm gon' do the whole dash in this motherfucker
I'm 'bout to pass out in this motherfucker
I'm 'bout to pass out in this motherfucker
This bitch exotic than a motherfucker
These bitches  do anything for me

[Chorus]
I think fifty-six nights crazy
I think fifty-six nights crazy
I think me and Esco crazy
I think me and Young Sco' crazy
I did fifty-six broads on the European tour and they was all crazy
I did fifty-six broads on the European tour and they was all crazy
I took fifty-six bars all in one month nigga and I'm still dranking
I could still see the scar on a nigga hand, man this shit real crazy
I been taking these molly's, still nodding off 'cause a nigga too faded
I've been laying low key inside a nigga vault, money is my motivation

[Verse 3]
Yacht cruisin' in the deep
I'm twisted up, I got geeked
Misbehaving with your freak
Can't tell she got teeth
I was in her mouth like veneers
Stop comparing my career
Designer flooded through the crib
Bentley furniture for real
Bought a Fendi couch for my kids
They just want to plug a nigga wig
Charge a half a mil for the gig
Middle fingers up, fuck the pigs
Diamonds fallin' off me, let me jig
Never falling off and never quit
I retired cookin' up a brick
Certified nigga out the 6
Who was wrapping dummies in the zone
I was chargin' 10 for the strong
Keep on goin' in on this song
Keep an F&N at your home
Lesson learned and we moving on
I got Firm niggas, Al Capone
Got my Chi niggas on the horn
Downtown Atlanta I was born

[Intro]
Purple Reign
Wizard
Yeah
Thinkin' about them licks I hit, I had to
Thinkin' about if you was here, I had you
Savage
Gon' roll it up, my nigga
Roll up, jump out the car, and squeeze the trigger
Gon' roll it up, my nigga
Roll up, hop out the car, and squeeze the trigger

[Chorus]
I can hear the purple callin'
I can hear the Perkies callin'
I can hear the purple callin'
I can hear the Xannies callin'
I can hear them Percs callin'
I can hear the workers callin'
I can hear the streets callin'
I can hear the streets callin'

[Verse 1]
Thinkin' about them licks I hit, I had to
Thinkin' about if you was here, I had you
Thinkin' about that cash like it's fast food
I'm thinkin' about this cash like it's fast food
I'm payin' all my tithes, receivin' bad news
Lord, forgive me for my sins, I know this cash rules
Everything around me turn to fast food
Standin' in the cold, I ain't got no blanket
These hoes always gettin' exposed, ain't got home trainin'
And when I push up in that Rolls and I'm still drankin'
Went from standin' over stoves to the tour bus
Stayed down, ten toes, board the G5
So much yellow gold on me like a beehive
Started rockin' Balmain's like they Levi's
Over time, the booth is like a gold mine
I served in Alabama like Roll Tide

[Chorus]
I can hear the purple callin'
I can hear the Perkies callin'
I can hear the purple callin'
I can hear the Xannies callin'
I can hear them Percs callin'
I can hear the workers callin'
I can hear the streets callin'
I can hear the streets callin'

[Verse 2]
Aquafina water got me glistenin'
When I whip that Bimmer, can't you picture me rollin'?
Fuck you pussy niggas, ain't no sympathy
Niggas tellin' lies, they so feminine
I be sellin' pies, chasin' M&M's
Fuck a 9 to 5, get it out the gym
Push illegal weight, we call it out the gym
Knock 'em off on tape, that's murder on film
I need better thoughts, I need better vibes
Focus on the top and let my nigga slide
I need more advice and ain't got no time
Hustlin', do right, feel like I waited a lifetime
Weigh up both sides 'cause your life ain't like mines
Pay me no mind, I ain't payin' no fine
Everything I did was for my hood this whole time
I'm talkin' this whole time, for my hood this whole time
Gotta take advantage, gotta learn how to take advantage, dog
Stole a golf cart, I go and buy a ballpark
Drove a stolen car and now my car a push start
I'm from the apartments, my crib big like Wal-Mart

[Chorus]
I can hear the purple callin'
I can hear the Perkies callin'
I can hear the purple callin'
I can hear the Xannies callin'
I can hear them Percs callin'
I can hear the workers callin'
I can hear the streets callin'
I can hear the streets callin'

[Outro]
Gon' roll it up, my nigga
Roll up, jump out the car, and squeeze the trigger
Gon' roll it up, my nigga
Roll up, hop out the car, and squeeze the trigger

[Verse 1]
Never made love to a misfit
You never made love to a misfit
Come and kick a deal on some rich shit
I'ma keep it pimpin' on some rich shit
We can do the show on the jet lift
Fuckin' in the air on the jet, bitch
We can do the helicopter cruisin' over Vegas
Hundred thousand dollars for a watch, count fetti
Kiss on a nigga with his chains on, glizzy
Fuck so good, got both of us dizzy
Do it lowkey, profile, get busy
Do it lowkey, profile, gettin' busy
Got the Audemars Piguet on fleek
Got my number one freak in the sheets
And all she want is the D
And for me to keep this ice on me

[Chorus]
Baby let's go and have rich sex
Make a little love, have rich sex (Yeah, yeah)

[Verse 2]
Let's stop for a while, have recess
Let's stop for a while, have recess
Let's kiss for a while, have recess
Let's touch for a while, have recess
Do it for a while like a replay
Let me see you wind that ass up like a DJ
Run that back like a DJ
I know you see this big face
Chandelier froze for a bad one
Come and kick game in your ear while I smash you
And I keep them thangs in my ear while I'm stabbin'
And I catch you hot like the flame and the passion
And I got the flash on deck, no battery
And I have some Tom Fords on while you suckin' me
Cuban link hang off my neck, to your nip from my neck
To my watch and my chain, it's gon' drizzle, gon' drizzle

[Chorus]
Baby let's go and have rich sex
Make a little love , have rich sex (yeah, yeah)

[Chorus]
I blow a bag today, I don't do nothin' fugazi
I blow a bag today, I walk in the mall and go crazy
I blow a bag today, hop out the whip on 'em, babe
I blow a bag today, hop out the whip on 'em, babe
I blow a bag today, I blow a bag today
I blow a bag today, Chyna gon' fuck me so crazy
I blow a bag today, I blow a bag today
I blow a bag today, I don't do nothin' fugazi

[Verse 1]
I had a bag today, I blow the bag today
I had to grab the Wraith, I had to grab the Wraith
I had to change the safe, I had to change my bitch
Money'll change a nigga, the fame'll change a bitch
I know I came from poverty, I got my name from poverty
I know for sure, for sure
If my granddad was livin', I know he'd be proud of me
I know for sure, for sure
If Snupe was living, I know he'd be proud of me
I know for sure, for sure
If Lonzo was livin', he never would've doubted me
I know for sure, for sure
I live with these diamonds, just check out my clarity
Gotta just check out these clarity
I get so fly like a parachute
I pull up right now and embarrass you
I sold the crack on my avenue
Only the strong survive
I'm just enjoying my life

[Chorus]
I blow a bag today, I don't do nothin' fugazi
I blow a bag today, I walk in the mall and go crazy
I blow a bag today, hope out the whip on 'em, babe

I blow a bag today, I blow a bag today
I blow a bag today, I don't do nothin' fugazi

[Verse 2]
I ran it up with the same niggas
Get that money and stay with the same niggas
I know that money can change niggas
They don't look at you like you the same nigga
I just hope I can remain humble
Hop out a Ghost in the jungle, I did it
Sell all the dope out them apartments, I did it
I'm 'bout to cut off some niggas I know that ain't with me
Runnin' with niggas that wanna see niggas
That get it and niggas who strive
And the real niggas is all they come across, yeah
I know either way it goes, Sunny gon' be there
I know either way it goes, Doe Boy gon' be there (Young Metro!)
Even when a nigga was broke, Scooter was always there
I be pourin' up this 4, they thought we wouldn't be here
I told you, come a time when we had to persevere
I knew there'd come a time when we'd all be here

[Chorus]
I blow a bag today, I don't do nothin' fugazi
I blow a bag today, I walk in the mall and go crazy

Future Hendrix
It's red bottoms when you walk to me
Come here and talk to me
You gon' make me throw the racks on you, baby, ayy

[Intro]
My uncle Ronnie used to wash cars
My uncle Wayne was a kingpin, you know what I'm saying?
My uncle Don, that nigga used to rob banks and shit, rest in peace
My granddaddy was a boss, he was a kingpin, you heard?

[Chorus]
Got the game from them old niggas
You gotta know where I'm from to get to know a nigga
I skipped class to smoke weed
Hidin' from the police
I spent time overseas, hangin' out in England
And I got the squad on my mind and I mean this
Do a little time out the country, I need this
56 nights, gotta know the real meanin'

[Interlude 1]
Dropped Monster tape and had to go to Europe

[Verse 1]
Best thing I ever did was fall out of love
'Sco came to me, said, "They think you washed up
You need to go back in, show these niggas who the one"
We going back in soon as we get off tour
He had my hard drive on him when he caught the case
When they took him into custody, they took my life away

[Interlude 2]
People didn't even understand that
My hard drives that I recorded all my music on
For two years straight was on this...
Was on this one hard drive that Esco had
And he was locked up with it
So I had to record new music
That's when I did Beast Mode

[Verse 2]
I'm fresh off the plane on them Zaytiggys
I endured so much pain, ain't got 'Sco with me
Ain't got nobody to smoke one or pour with me
Niggas rocked the lean, man, when I was OT
And I'm still dealin' with the time they gave Doe B
How he gon' catch an armed robbery around me?
And my lifestyle getting way bigger
I got so much love for my niggas
Brown paper bag, we gettin' back to the paper
Gettin' back to the basics
Everything I did, it was premeditated
I just knew there'd come a time when I finally did make it
And some niggas started hatin'
I ain't never had no problem with these niggas
I've been about my guala from the dodo
Got an R&B chick layin' on me, no photo
Got a combo in the condo doin' some real life porno

[Bridge]
And I ain't worried 'bout nothin' in the world, keep a badass bitch
These niggas ain't none of my worries, damn that shit
There's so much more I gotta endure
I just had my baby, gotta go on tour (fuck that shit)

[Chorus]
Got the game from them old niggas
You gotta know where I'm from to get to know a nigga
I skipped class to smoke weed
Hidin' from the police
I spent time overseas, hangin' out in England
And I got the squad on my mind and I mean this
Do a little time out the country, I need this
56 nights, gotta know the real meanin'

[Verse 3]
I ain't holding this back, I ain't holding this
The music way ahead of its time and I notice this
Get back in the studio, give 'em what they was missing
They didn't know I knew the game and I know how to reinvent it
They ain't know me in the cut, they just know me from rhymin'
My hard work finally catchin' up with perfect timin'

[Interlude 3]
You know what I'm saying
I could take a hundred dollar slab
And goddamn make three hundred off that bitch, you dig?

[Chorus]
Got the game from them old niggas
You gotta know where I'm from to get to know a nigga
I skipped class to smoke weed
Hidin' from the police
I spent time overseas, hangin' out in England
And I got the squad on my mind and I mean this
Do a little time out the country, I need this
56 nights, gotta know the real meanin'

[Outro]
Everything in the streets
It prepared me for everything that I'm going through right now
The good and the bad, you know what I'm saying?
Can't let none of this shit get to me
I go harder 'cause I know where I was at
And I know where I wanna go

[Intro]
Aw yeah
Aw yeah, aw yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah
Check this out

[Verse 1]
I get mad zooted, I got this bad thing I recruited
My passion is a movie, I say fuck her 'cause I screwed her
I stay on Miley Cyrus, everywhere I go I'm screwed up
I know my Texas niggas got my back and that's for sure though
Sippin' on Easter Pink like it's Tanqueray
We ain't never gon' give this fuckin' life up
I know the boys saying they gettin' to the money over there
Baby, trust me, these niggas nothin' like us
I put charisma in my lingo and she fell for me
I gave her realness, and that's all she gonna get from me
Bonafide superstar, I'm straight up out the hood-ood
I just did a dose of Percocets with some strippers

[Chorus]
I just did a dose of Percocet with some strippers
I just poured this lean in my cup like it's liquor
I just need a whole lot of drugs in my system
I just tried acid for the first time, I feel good

[Verse 2]
Treasure bring misery, codeine in my delivery
I pulled up in a big B, swervin' like a hippie
Movin' with the dopers and pushers
In the Rover duckin' undercover, huggin' the Interstate
Coppin' a couple cakes and the drum hangin' under me
Got a chain hangin' over me
God watching over me, all my angels watch over me
I bag it like groceries, keep some cash flowing over me
Got some money all in my hand and I stack it all under me
The young niggas under me, they gon' stand up in any war
We built this shit ground up like the head of a seminar
I talk for the real ones, I talk for them niggas that feel this shit out in Belgium
Freeband Gang

[Chorus]
I just did a dose of Percocet with some strippers
I just poured this lean in my cup like it's liquor
I just need a whole lot of drugs in my system
I just tried acid for the first time, I feel good

Drink a bunch of codeine
Serving to the dope fiends
Blowing money, stay clean
Michael Jackson, Billie Jean

[Verse 1: Future]
Got a Panamera 'round a young nigga neck
Got a young bitch pulling up in a 'Vette
Smoke a lot of kush & I have a lot of sex
Had to beat the grind up, ran up my check

[Verse 2: Future]
Whipping up a cake, just to go and snatch a Spyder (Spyder)
Young nigga play with keys (keys), like a type writer
Al Capone, John Gotti was a nigga idol
I was never snitching, I can put it on the Bible
In a four-door Bimmer, driving with a rifle
Nigga, where you at? (at) nigga, we gon' pull up on ya
Young bitch looking like Janet in the '80s ('80s)
We was grinding up from two and a baby (oh)

Send it over from Lil' Mexico and let me work (lets work)
I can get 36 for a clean shirt (shirt)

Sell remix, don't sell no clean
My hand like a triple beam
I got workers like machine
All I do is sell dreams
Half my niggas serve fiends
I get up and then I lean

[Chorus: Future]
Ayy
Slang a bunch of narcotics

[Intro]
Yeah
This bitch from Australian and I'm an alien
(808 Mafia)

[Chorus]
I sip out a cup of this shit, it's so muddy, but I love it, baby
When I jump out the whip, when I hop out the whip then I'm fresh in the latest
I do what I want, and I smoke 'til I'm faded
I drink 'til I pass out, I wake up and drink up again
I pour up again and again
I said I wasn't gonna fuck with that bitch, then I fucked her again
I scream out the gutter and the sewer, the streets turned a boy to a man
I nodded off with that Ruger, I took your bitch to Aruba
She fuck with Super 'cause she got that super
When I say super, that's young Super Future
We never gon' lose, we never gon' lose

[Verse]
Never gon' lose 'cause these bitches gon' choose
These bitches gon' be who they is
Walkin' and talkin' like classy
You a ho to your heart, you a ho to your heart
You know I'll be workin' that boy, I'ma pour it
Servin' that boy out the back of the yard
Fuck on your ho, I'm just playin' my cards
Whip after whip put up in the garage
Sip on the lean like a fifth of the dark
Hop in the Spur, then might hop in the Porsche
Telly then rally and gather the squad
Yeah, girl eat the squad
Me and my niggas so mothafuckin' tight
You can't even tell us apart
Fuck a bitch every single damn night
Ain't nothin' but an avatar
Valet the car on the curb like I'm swervin' on alcohol
Get to poppin' them Percocets and Xanax like they some Tylenol
I remember nights in Europe sayin' we ain't fallin' off
I'm on a lot of green, we gotta have some green
When I hit the plane and I board it
I got a magazine with no Visine
Just ridin' around with this .40
She gon' thug for me, she gon' thug for me
In Ohio, that's my shorty
We ain't playin' around these [?][1:36]
We gon' go upside your noggin
You see they try sabotage me, then copy
They wasn't playin' fair no-no, no-no, no-no
Bitch is a bozo, she clown in the photos
We sell that coco, you talkin' to po-po
You know that's a no, though, you know that's a no-no
Know that's a no-no, no-no-no, no-no-no
Came at the door, pour, serve out the paddy door
Bitch I'm your man and your daddy, ho
Panty droppers had no panties on
Bitch, you steppin' in, no panties on
Back with these stallions
Back-to-back, back, back-to-back with these stallions
Like she trunk after trunk, I just carry on
Got the sack on me, now I just carry it
Got some M's in New Orleans, I buried it
For the cash and some M's, I'll marry it
See the way they just jumped on the bandwagon
Went bought a G-Wagen
Fifty-six nights, I had to get at it
Mayweather, Pacquiao, nigga, we still at it
Get up and get at it, guns like I'm Bin Laden

[Chorus]
I sip out a cup of this shit, it's so muddy, but I love it, baby
When I jump out the whip, when I hop out the whip then I'm fresh in the latest
I do what I want, and I smoke 'til I'm faded
I drink 'til I pass out, I wake up and drink up again
I pour up again and again
I said I wasn't gonna fuck with that bitch, then I fucked her again
I scream out the gutter and the sewer, the streets turned a boy to a man
I nodded off with that Ruger, I took your bitch to Aruba
She fuck with Super 'cause she got that super
When I say super, that's young Super Future
We never gon' lose, we never gon' lose

[Outro]
Woo
These bitches gon' choose
We never gon' lose

[Intro: Future]
Why did we go all the way?
What do we do, ohhh, when it rains?

[Hook: Mr. Hudson]
When the sun dies and the stars fade from view
Our love will remain real and true
Through the distant and cold depths of space
The radio sings our song, it's a love real and true

[Verse 1: Future]
Hold on, hold on, hold up Future, what the fuck you doin'?
You can annihilate way more chicks than the chick you screwin'
You on top of your game, homie, man you a star
You got real bitches, they love that nigga that you are
They say you're like Jimi Hendrix, in his early twenties
You in Vegas, you supposed to be with a snow bunny
You a player, huh, you wanna come around and save her
Keep it trill, you lovin' her just as much as your career
You mad ill, I knew you'd be the one to keep it real
And I can't even lie, dog, when I see y'all it gives me chills
And Imma stand behind y'all because I know the way you live
Aye just do me this favor, you give it time, time reveals

[Hook: Miley Cyrus]
When the sun dies and the stars fade from view
Our love will remain real and true
Through the distant and cold depths of space
The radio sings our song, it's a love real and true

[Verse 2: Miley Cyrus]
We've been in the same place, for a long, long time
If our hearts go the wrong way, I still know you're mine
Should we even try to fight it?
If our love is trapped in all ways
I know that things been rough
But when you're by my side
It's more than enough, yeah
For us to make it through the test of time

[Hook: Mr. Hudson]
When the sun dies and the stars fade from view
Our love will remain real and true
Through the distant and cold depths of space
The radio sings our song, it's a love real and true

[Verse 3: Future]
Standin' in the middle of humility
Can't nobody never love you more than me
Can't nobody never love you more than me
If love is all you need, I'm all you'll ever need
I can never be scared of commitment
I can prevail through life without bein' malicious
I can't hold you for responsible for your mischiefs
I hope you are never huntin' me with vengeance
I'm not predictin' anything, I'm just listenin'
Congratulations, you made it, you coulda missed it
And I'm acceptin' your past but forgiveness
And with all the mistakes I've made, you're still listenin'

[Hook: Mr. Hudson, Miley Cyrus, and Future]
When the sun dies and the stars fade from view
Our love will remain real and true
Through the distant and cold depths of space
The radio sings our song, it's a love real and true

[Bridge: Future]
Real and true
Real and true
Real and true
Real and true
And I can fight temptations off
I ain't soft, no I ain't soft
You can't be lettin' the rap shit go to your head
Can't be cancellin' no shows, fuckin' up your bread
Check out these rumors, that ain't nothin' but the devil
That's why we gotta continue to pray together

[Hook: Mr. Hudson, Miley Cyrus, and Future]
When the sun dies and the stars fade from view
Our love will remain real and true
Through the distant and cold depths of space
The radio sings our song, it's a love real and true

[Intro]
I've been in the stu late, workin', no residuals
If we never speak again, I'm just glad I got to tell the truth
I ain't done countin'
You wanna come to paradise?
Matter of fact, you wanna come to Pluto?
Haha

[Verse 1]
She told me she was an angel
She fucked two rappers and three singers
She got a few athletes on speed dial
I'm tryna get the case dismissed before I see trial
And these codeine habits ain't got nothin' to do with my lil' child
No this codeine ain't got nothin' to do with my lil' child
I used to sell dope at my grandma's house, as a rude child
All these cameras on, fuckin' with my mood, wild
And these chains clinkin' back and forth, they too loud
They know damn well this wasn't promised
I know damn well this must be karma
Left every pair of Margielas at the condo
Technically I never packed up and leave
Left 80 racks in the dresser, you can keep
And I got this bad ting at disposal
I cooked it up and then I went global
My baby mama push a Range Rover
Had to make sure I got it fully loaded
Can't be the one and then you get exposed
If you the one, then God will let me know
But at the same time, I like to vibe with one
I'm paranoid, I gotta ride with one
And I had to 'splain to her last night
Had to send this one freak on the last flight
Had to send this one freak on the last flight

[Chorus]
Won't get a response from me, ain't no confessions
Before I tell a lie, won't tell you nothin'
Any time I got you, girl you my possession
Even if I hit you once, you part of my collection
Even if I hit you once, you part of my collection
Even if I hit you once, you part of my collection

[Verse 2]
Standin' on Black Sox, meet me at the yacht dock
Icin' out the clock, watch, bitches on my cock
Yeah, maybe it's the drop, yeah
We get in our feelings, yeah
I don't know how you would feel about if I ain't have millions, yeah
I'm conversin' with you, I hope you hear me, yeah
Keep my promise, take my love with you everywhere
And hell no it ain't about no braggin' rights
But even if it was, shit I got it
Pinstripes on a hardtop Bugatti
She told me she was an angel
She fucked two rappers and three singers
I'ma keep it genuine and tell the truth to you
I got this jawn, she know what to do with me
And right now I don't know what to do with you
I don't wanna sound like I'm bein' rude with you
She caught a red eye, leavin' L.A
I shoulda gave her to the valet
And I had to tell her 'bout Miami
After she came with no panty

[Chorus]
Won't get a response from me, ain't no confessions
Before I tell a lie, won't tell you nothin'
Any time I got you, girl you my possession
Even if I hit you once, you part of my collection
Even if I hit you once, you part of my collection
Even if I hit you once, you part of my collection

[Intro: Nicki Minaj]
Ten thousand miles up in the sky
We never land 'cause we stay fly
I'ma be your bitch for life
If they try you, they gotta die
Baby, put one in the sky
What we got, they can't deny
Put your diamonds in the light
And let 'em see you shine bright

[Chorus: Future]
Fuck them hoes
Hold up, wait one minute
Hold up, wait one minute
Hold up, wait one minute
Yo, hold up, wait one more

Fuck them hoes, fuck them hoes

Fuck them hoes, fuck them hoes

[Verse 1: Future]
Percocets and molly make you touch your toe
I keep the conversation open for my hoe
Snapchat that pussy, don't you take too long
Trampoline, titties, girl, they bouncin', yeah
All these diamonds on me, how could I tell you no?
You got one leg in the air, tap it like you broke
Sweating out your weave, girl, fuck that hoe
Girl, you ain't gotta leave, we gon' fuck this hoe
Percocets and molly's make you touch your toe
Been in this bitch so long, I'm going up a dose
Pussy got more murders than New Mexico
Bust it open wide and let that ocean flow
Money be the motive, baby, fuck them hoes
You know why you did it, baby, fuck them hoes
Tell them crackers "fuck 'em", we don't love them hoes
Th-they don't want no problems, baby, fuck them hoes

[Chorus: Future]
We know you the baddest baby, fuck them hoes
Fuck them hoes, fuck them hoes
We on a different planet girl, fuck them hoes
Fuck them hoes, fuck them hoes

[Verse 2: Nicki Minaj]
Yo, yo
Wait, wait, wait, hold up, wait
Stevie to the bull like where's MJ? Where's MJ?
Don't come around with that weird energy, weird energy
Bitch, I got that 25 karats on my Patek, I'm ecstatic
Got them blue diamonds dancing in my party, democratic
I never lose nothing but, damn, I done had it
I ain't never strike out, they can't average what I batted, no
If she hatin', tell that bitch to let it go

[Bridge: Future, Both]
Truly rude boy, truly rude
Truly rude boy, truly rude
Truly rude boy, truly rude
Truly rude boy, truly rude
Percocets and molly's make you touch your toe
Been in this bitch so long, i'm going up a dose
Pussy got more murders than New Mexico
Bust it open wide and let that ocean flow

[Chorus: Future]
We know you the baddest baby, fuck them hoes
Fuck them hoes, fuck them hoes
We on a different planet girl, fuck them hoes
Fuck them hoes, fuck them hoes
We know you the baddest baby, fuck them hoes
Fuck them hoes, fuck them hoes
We on a different planet girl, fuck them hoes
Fuck them hoes, fuck them hoes

[Outro: Future]
Oooh, la-la-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la-la
Oooh, la-la-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la-la
Got about a thousand upon my side
We out here hustlin', risking our life
Fill cocaine up in your tights
We had to make it across the line
Damn near didn't make it through them nights
I watch the bloody tears fall from your eye
You just wanna live a nigga life
Sittin' in a helicopter, I can touch the sky
Fuck them hoes
Just fuck them hoes

[Chorus]
Yeah, ain't really mean to hurt you
Sorry it's gotta be this way
Ain't mean to try to desert you
Sorry, tryna be this way
Ain't really mean to hurt you
Ain't really mean to hurt you
Ain't really mean to hurt you
Sorry it's gotta be that way
Ain't mean to desert you
Sorry that it looked that way
Ain't really tryna hurt you
Ain't really mean to hurt you
Ain't really tryna hurt you
Sorry it's gotta be that way
Ain't really tryin'
I ain't really tryin'

[Verse 1]
I was in the U.K. thinkin', shit don't feel the same
Addy got me daydreamin', hope I ain't goin' insane
Hard to say you care about me
When this mink draggin' to the floor
Tryna find a PYT, I already got some at home
I breathe the air she breathes
It's hard to breathe on my own
It's somethin' 'bout infidelity
Make me check every single stone
Gotta drink my blood like a Hebrew
'Cause I've been gettin' fly, since Evisu
Made her switch sides in Ibiza
I can get you off in Belgium
Diamonds shinin' off very seldom
Grab a couple chickens, then mail them
Take 'em to the hood, then sell them
Fam come first, you never fail them
Rebellious, always respect my elders
That's why I might treat you like I'm careless
Sold crack to a pregnant lady
Forgive me for the crack baby
If I open up my eyes, it turn black for real
Pack was too small, I ain't have it vacuum sealed
Word to Uncle Charles, nigga I got the sack for real
Money, broads, lawyers cost a half a mil'
Fame change, the family loves the way it is
Fame change, a ho loves the way I give
Paid for my mistakes like a drug deal
Paid for my mistakes like a drug deal

[Chorus]
Yeah, ain't really mean to hurt you
Sorry it's gotta be this way
Ain't mean to try to desert you
Sorry, tryna be this way
Ain't really mean to hurt you
Ain't really mean to hurt you
Ain't really tryin'

[Verse 2]
It can get scary when you legendary
Caramel complexion, that's a Halle Berry
Cash rules everything around music
The game doped up, every nigga usin'
Grab the fuckin' carbon, hit him with the tool
I'm not tryna argue, I got issues
You see what I've been put up against, baby
You see why I've been tryna make the rent, baby
Tryna keep you closer than lint, baby
Dime rose, 'bout to get lynched, baby
It's hard to caress you
All your bad energy, it's hard to bless you
Commercial flights gettin' too hectic
V12 motors, my confession
Tryna identify, you look sketchy
I'm a real nigga, it's hard to accept me

[Chorus]
Yeah, ain't really mean to hurt you
Sorry it's gotta be this way
Ain't mean to try to desert you
Sorry, tryna be this way
Ain't really mean to hurt you
Ain't really mean to hurt you
Ain't really tryin'

[Verse 3]
Hot tenderoni, Bobby Brown ooh
Shawty so phony, I got somethin' to prove
Work every day like I got somethin' to lose
Oxycont' got me flown up, nothin' new
Styrofoam cups, everything is approved
Styrofoam cups, everything is approved
Money stacked up and it got me seduced
I got that hot dope, but I got that boost though
Ayy, my Lamb hit a pothole
These bitches some thot hoes
I hit the lotto in South Africano
Yacht party, sittin' at the dock of the condo
Better not be late, bitch, you better come pronto!
Better come with a combo
Asian persuasion, Cubana, mi ana
Yolanda, Sholanda, Miyana, mi casa
I don't know Spanish, I barely talk proper
It became problems when I didn't send flowers
King like Mufasa, messiah, then higher
Goshies and Rollies, yeah, fuck all the police
Shout out my woadie, he smashin' the C.O
My wrist got an ego, my watch in an igloo
We took illegal, got stripes like a zebru
Pimp like a rollin' stone, high when I greet you
Diamonds just fall on you, effortlessly ball on you
L-O-to-V-E, hope you ain't get greedy
Chasers do numbers, man chains is on Fiji
Kidnapped your heart 'cause you gave it too easy
Diamonds on sight is way brighter than Geezy
Shout out to DiDi, got goonies on speedy
She like it rated, ain't nothin' 'bout her PG
I had it, made it, I thought I was jaded
Persian, Malaysian? Super sensation
Yah, sushi was raw when she got confiscated
No invitations, we showed up and made it
Long as my dawgs here, bitches betrayed me
Pigeons contagious, I shoulda known it
I turned the pages, heavily sedated
Too many clone me, too many phonies
Armani on me, you never warned me
How can you blame us when we all out the trenches?
Gold chains and rings, they're so easily gettin' offended
Spendin' all your show money tryna keep up with my image
Fuck around, take a O from me, and never give a penny
Fuck y'all, I skrrt off, 'cause everything shitty
I hit my first model, stepped up my pimpin'
Caught her off the runway, she instantly committed
Paper got my mind gone, too caught up on my city
In and out of time zones, runnin' up a billi'
Indian Cherokee, clarity, shinin' is therapy
Mami Israeli (Mami Israeli)

[Chorus]
Ain't really mean to hurt you
Sorry it's gotta be this way
Ain't mean to try to desert you
Sorry, tryna be this way
Ain't really mean to hurt you
Ain't really mean to hurt you
Ain't really mean to hurt you
Ain't really mean to hurt you
Ain't really mean to hurt you
Sorry it's gotta be that way
Ain't mean to desert you
Sorry that it looked that way
Ain't really tryna hurt you
Ain't really mean to hurt you
Ain't really tryna

Ba-baby, fuck it up, one time (Ooh)

[Intro]
It's a light day
Ain't got on nothin' but about $700 thousand worth
That's it
You know what I'm sayin'?

[Verse 1]
I was havin' trust issues
But I've been havin' way better luck since you
I know it's true love with you
Told myself I don't wanna fall in love with you
Rollin' on the eway speedin'
Friday, just started the weekend
XO textin', you respondin'
We gon' go crazy with this money
We do hot yoga, 92 degrees
Can you stretch it out? Stretch it out for me
I got somewhere to be, but it's hard to leave
When you do it like you mean it, I'm proceedin'
Is you the one? Is you the one?
Then she looked me in my eyes
Told me, "Fuck them pussy niggas
They ain't ridin' 'cause I'm ridin'
And I'm dyin' for you, baby"
Got me feelin'

[Chorus]
In-in-incredible
In-in-incredible
In-in-incredible
Incredible
Yeah, yeah

[Verse 2]
We can do exactly what you like, baby
And it's all on me
We can take Vicodin tonight, baby
It's all on me
We been textin' back and forth
Now it's time to get it crackin'
Girl, take it all out 'cause I know you active
Did you come to talk or is you 'bout that action?
Diamonds on my neck, moonwalkin', Michael Jackson
I'ma have your body sweatin' like you dipped in baby oil
I'ma do whatever it's gon' take to keep my baby spoiled
I'ma do whatever it's gon' take to shake these haters off
Put it on, fuck the cost
I just wanna show you off
I can see your flaws, she gon' take me how I am
Hit it from the back, girl, you know I'm goin' ham
Fuck the pigs, girl, you got me feelin' like the man
Yeah, yeah

[Chorus]
In-in-incredible
In-in-incredible
In-in-incredible
Incredible
Yeah, yeah
Way you move your body, girl I'll give you an advance
Know you, girl, you fuckin' with a full-grown man
The way you move your body, I'ma have a change of plans
In-in-in-incredible
In-in-incredible
In-in-incredible
Incredible
Yeah, yeah

[Verse 3]
I'ma have your body sweatin' like you dipped in baby oil
I'ma do whatever it take to keep my fuckin' baby spoiled
I'ma do whatever it takes to shake these fuckin' bitches off
I'ma do whatever it takes and you gon' be my personal
Dance, dance, girl you dancin' like you strippin' for this gold
Romance and we've all done been here before
But your passion, I hear it when you're talkin'
We ain't clashin', you quiet when I'm talkin'
Put them diamonds on you, have 'em Billie Jean moonwalkin'
Put them diamonds on you, have 'emmmmm moonwalkin'
You get into everything exclusively, I'm honest
We don't need nobody comin' inbetween this money
These niggas already tryna invade the embassy
Good thing I changed and you got that remedy
The best thing about you, oh you're that far from me
You a star to me

[Chorus]
In-in-incredible
In-in-incredible
In-in-incredible
Incredible
Yeah, yeah
Way you move your body, girl I'll give you an advance
Know you, girl, you fuckin' with a full-grown man
The way you move your body, I'ma have a change of plans
In-in-in-incredible
In-in-incredible
In-in-incredible
Incredible
In-in-incredible
In-in-incredible
In-in-incredible
Incredible
Yeah, yeah

[Intro]
You know how we be rocking, ya heard

[Verse 1]
Bright light shining all bright on the Bentley
Work the Cadillac, panoramic, no panties
Old school Chevy '55 granddaddy
Gotta throw some salt on it, 'cause you know I'm getting at it
Throw the fork on it, then put it in traffic
Throw the sauce on it, got it flying out of Dallas
Hope you didn't do it to yourself, that's tragic
Hope you didn't throw away what we established
Hope you wouldn't turn your back on your family
The way a nigga look 'round here, they'll back stab you
Word from your motherfucking brother, young nigga
I just wanna see you happy, I just wanna see you happy
Coming through the cut like a known Grim Reaper
'Bout to get it straight finessed, tryna get a little cheaper
Hold on to that clip like a doped up needle
Girl hang on that strip with a four Desert Eagle

[Chorus]
Nothing but a bad little bitch in some red bottoms
Where ya man at? Heard that the Feds got 'em
I seen ya cruise the Land Rover through the west side
Gold Rolex, better check your peripheral
It's a full moon in the middle of the day
Got them wolves out, rock a little Cartier
Got the trap jammed packed like The Masquerade
Know a few real ones ain't gon' see they next birthday
Tell them young niggas grind
'Fore you gon' knock someone down
If they gon' shoot, then shoot something
We better hear 'bout this shit on the news or something
We better hear 'bout this shit on the news or something
Man down over yonder
Young came through holding on the cane like a drummer
They done took a boss out nigga, no wonder
Niggas getting crossed out nigga, no wonder
Hoes getting Xd out and we on ganja
The police wanna talk, but we won't say nothing
True to these clips, niggas won't say nothing
True to these clips, niggas won't say nothing

[Verse 2]
Had the Parkay jumping out the Pyrex
High definition glass on my pinky finger
Niggas swimming in the water, no paddle
Niggas trying to walk in my shadow
The bird on the bezel, I'm a well known rebel
Told a young nigga Freeband, Roc-A-Fella
Told a young nigga Freeband, Roc-A-Fella
You can turn this off and I can kick it acapella
We work the frontstreet where mama said "Don't go"
We went there
Trap house embalmed with that crack, then we went there
Shawty don't fuck with these folks, these
Niggas be telling these days, be telling these days

[Chorus]
Nothing but a bad little bitch in some red bottoms
Where ya man at? Heard that the feds Got 'em
I seen ya cruise the Land Rover through the west side
Gold Rolex, better check your peripheral
It's a full moon in the middle of the day
Got them wolves out, rock a little Cartier
Got the trap jammed packed like The Masquerade
Know a few real ones ain't gon' see they next birthday
Tell them young niggas grind
'Fore you gon' knock someone down
If they gon' shoot, then shoot something
We better hear 'bout this shit on the news or something
We better hear 'bout this shit on the news or something
Man down over yonder
Young came through holding on the cane like a drummer
They done took a boss out nigga, no wonder
Niggas getting crossed out nigga, no wonder
Hoes getting X'd out and we on ganja
The police wanna talk, but we won't say nothing
True to these clips, niggas won't say nothing
True to these clips, niggas won't say nothing
