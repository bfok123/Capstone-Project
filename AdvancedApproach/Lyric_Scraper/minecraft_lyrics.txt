[Intro] (spoken)
"Alright guys, *cough* I'm doing 'Take On Me' now, alright. I, I really, I really like this song. It sounds good."

[Verse 1]
Minin' away
I don't know what to mine
I'll mine this anyway
In this Minecraft day
So beautiful, mine further down
What's that I found?

[Chorus]
Mine diamonds (Take on me)
Mine diamonds (Take on me)
I'll mine them
So far I've got two!

[Verse 2]
So easy to mine
With my Minecraft pickaxe and shovels
Hopefully they stay
In my Minecraft chests
So I'm gonna make
A lock on it

[Chorus]
Mine diamonds (Take on me)
Mine diamonds (Take on me)
I'll mine them
So far I've got two!

[Bridge]
"Ah! *cough, cough, cough, cough, sniff, cough*
I'm alright, I'm ready"

[Verse 3]
All these diamonds
Sittin' carefully lay
I'm getting worried (Shut the fucking door!)
If they might get stolen
From my ender chest
Wait, who is that?
Holy sheep, it's Notch!

[Chorus]
Mine diamonds (Take on me)
Mine diamonds (Take on me)
Now they're safe
*screaming*
Now
Now that they're safe
*screaming*
Mine diamonds, *heavy breathing* (Take on me)
Mine diamonds (Take on me)

[Outro]
Uh, thanks, thanks for listening guys and thanks for recommending this song

[Verse 1]
Uh, open up the potions, pop
It's my mine, come on, mine it up
Hear a hiss near the door and the night begins
Creepers done this before, I never let 'em in
Pack up your inventory, and we can go out
Bring some extra food so that you don't starve

[Pre-Chorus]
Sometimes you forget torches
And you gotta bring your pickaxe
Yeah, you know where we goin'
Sometimes you forget torches

[Chorus]
Welcome to my mine
We are mining diamonds
We don't gotta strip mine
We don't have to fight mobs
Welcome to my mine
Play that noteblock nicely
Show me all those emeralds
We don't gotta dodge lava

[Post-Chorus]
Welcome to my mine
Welcome to my mine

[Verse 2]
When it comes and you know that you wanna stay
Throw out dirt, let's start mining those real things
Keep those swords in our hands, and open up potions
Let's fight the mobs, come on, slash away

[Pre-Chorus]
Sometimes you forget torches
And you gotta bring a pickaxe
Yeah, we know where we goin'
Sometimes you forget torches

[Chorus]
Welcome to my mine
We are mining diamonds
We don't gotta strip mine
We don't have to fight mobs
Welcome to my mine
Play that noteblock nicely
Show me all those emeralds
We don't gotta dodge lava

[Post-Chorus]
Welcome to my mine
Welcome to my—

[Verse 3]
Welcome to my strip mine, the mine, the cave, the crack
But my mine is your mine if you treating it right
Sorry if my mine don't have the gold
As soon as I dig down we'll find more of that
Oh, my goodness, what is that?
Azul brillante, guapo, so we're gonna mine that
I think I know what that is
OMG, it's diamonds!

[Chorus]
Welcome to my mine
We— we'll mine diamonds
We don't gotta strip mine
We don't gotta fight mobs
Welcome to my mine
Play that noteblock nicely
Show me all those emeralds
We don't gotta dodge lava

[Post-Chorus]
Welcome to my mine
Welcome to my mine
Welcome to my mine
Ha, yeah

[Intro]
Alright guys, we’re back here with another Minecraft parody
Gonna close my door
Uh so uh, it’s going to be, uh, Pumped Up Kicks
I had this song requested just like Africa
And I think it’s a good song
I don’t know what it means but I just, I like it and uh (*sniffs*), yeah I'm gonna'- I'm gonna parody it

[Verse 1]
I have got good aim
I will steal all your diamond swords and take my plan…
I have 64 arrows in my inventory
I’m a good player
Yeah I found an enchanted bow in my ender chest
Some poison arrows
I like them, my gold, and I’m coming for you

[Chorus]
All the other players with the diamonds swords
You better sprint, better jump
And you won’t escape
All the other players with the iron or gold
You better jump, better sprint
Faster than my arrows
All the other players with the diamonds swords
You better sprint, better jump
You won’t escape
All the other kids with the iron or gold
You better jump, better sprint
Faster than my arrows

[Verse 2]
Eh, all day, I play Minecraft all day
And I’m working on my aim, and I’m working on my aim
I got myself another bow
It has infinity and a fire enchant
I waited for a long time
Now I can kill players even faster for their diamond swords
Honestly I might get banned
But I want the diamonds

[Chorus]
All of the players with the diamonds swords
You better sprint, better jump
You won’t escape
All the other players with the iron or gold
You better jump, better sprint
Faster than my arrows
All of the players with the diamonds swords
You better sprint, better jump
You won’t escape
All the other players with the iron or gold
You better jump, better sprint
Faster than my arrows

[Bridge]
Yeah, yeah, yeah
I got diamonds, gold, iron, woot-woot
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I got diamonds, gold, iron woot-woot
Ah, I got diamonds
I got gold and iron
Can’t, can’t, you can’t match up to me
'Cause I will kill you for free

[Chorus]
All of the players with the diamonds swords
You better run, better jump
You won’t escape
All of the players with the iron or gold
You better jump, better sprint
Faster than my arrows
All of the players with the diamonds ore swords
You better sprint, better jump
You won’t escape
All of the players with the iron or gold
You better jump, better sprint
Faster than my arrows
All of the players with the diamonds swords
You better jump, better sprint
You won’t escape
All of the players with the iron or gold
You better jump, better sprint
Faster than my arrows

All of the players with the…

Diamond Sword to Major Steve
Diamond Sword to Major Steve
Take your speed potion and put your diamond helmet on
Diamond Sword to Major Steve
Closing my Minecraft doors chests are empty.
Check your pickaxe, and may Notch love be with you

[Instrumental Bridge]

[Verse 2]
This is Diamond Sword to Major Steve
You're gonna find diamonds
And the creepers wanna know if you have much armor
Now it's time to dig straight down if you dare!
This is Major Steve to Diamond Pickaxe
I'm mining some obsidian
And it's taking very long, why does it have to?
And tonight lapis doesn't look like diamonds!

[Bridge]
From here I have 16 torches left
Noo more coal!
The mines are getting darker and there's nothing I can do

[Verse 3]
Though I've mined almost 100 diamonds, I'm getting very low on health
And I think my diamond pickaxe is about to break!
Please tell Notch I love him very much.
He knows!
Diamond Sword to Major Steve
Your sword just broke, there's creepers near!
Can I fight 'till I decease?
Can I fight 'till I decease?
Can I fight 'till I decease?

[Verse 4]
Can I fight all these creepers here's a way out
I see some grass
The mine is getting lighter, and I'm almost getting through.
(It's a good song)

[Intro]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, go, go away
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, go, go away
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, go, go away
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, go, go away

[Bridge]
We just want to mine ores
Mining just for you
We just want the diamonds
Diamonds just for you
I know you want to mine ores
Mine them just for me
Girl you got me mining
Mining killed the mobs
We just want to mine ores
Mining just for you
We just want the diamonds
Diamonds just for you
I know you want to mine ores
Mine them just for me
Girl you got me mining
Mining killed the mobs

[Chorus]
This is Minecraft

Don't catch you griefing stuff
I'll catch you stealing stuff
This is Minecraft
Don't catch you griefing stuff
Don't catch you griefing stuff
I'll catch you stealing stuff

[Verse 1]
This is Minecraft
Don't catch you griefing stuff
Look how I'm living now
Creepers be tripping now

Ores in my ender chest
I got the coal
I got to furnace them

Watch me mine
This a pickaxe
That's a tool
All my mineshaft
You know that
Hit it
Ooh, mine it
Ender pearls, ender pearls, ender pearls
Diamond pants, diamond pants, diamond pants
I got the cave in the forest
They gonna find you like Herobrine

[Introduction, spoken]
Hey guys, happy new year!

[Verse 1]
An admin once told me
That I could mine some diamonds
I have the sharpest tool in my chest
He was looking at me funny
Because I didn't have any diamonds
So I'm gonna go to a mineshaft

[Pre-Chorus]
So I didn't stop mining and I didn't stop mining
Not gonna stop 'til I get some diamonds
Got a crafting table and a bed
You take your sword but then it gets rough
Some much to mine, so much to sight
So what's wrong if I mine for days?
You'll never mine if you don't go
You'll never find any emerald

[Chorus]
Hey now, I'm a miner
Get my armour on, mine!
Hey now, smelting all ores
Gonna keep going, get iron!
All I want is diamonds
Only mining ores
Break the cobblestone

[Verse 2]
It's a deep place, but I'm gonna go deeper
Not gonna stop 'til I get some diamonds
Any new ore begins to differ
Judging by the mine that I have been mining in
He said he would just give me some more
But that wouldn't be the same as getting them myself
"What, with diamond ores?"
"That's the way I like getting them I'll never get bored"

[Chorus]
Hey now, I'm a miner
Get my armour on, mine!
Hey now, smelting all ores
Gonna keep going, get iron!
All I want is diamonds
Only mining ores
Break the cobblestone

[Spoken over Instrumental]
Yeah, thanks for this song

[Chorus]
Hey now, I'm a miner
Get my armour on, mine!
Hey now, smelting all ores
Gonna keep going, get iron!
All I want is diamonds
Only mining ores
Break the cobblestone

[Verse 3]
Somebody once asked "Could you spare some iron ingots?
I need to get diamonds myself"
I say no, hahaha, and I killed him with my sword
And it was really, really, great!

[Pre-Chorus]
So I didn't stop mining and I didn't stop mining
Not gonna stop 'til I get some diamonds
Got a crafting table and a bed
You take your sword but then it gets rough
Some much to mine, so much to sight
So what's wrong if I mine for days?
You'll never mine if you don't go
You'll never find any emerald

[Chorus]
Hey now, I'm a miner
Get my armour on, mine!
Hey now, smelting all ores
Gonna keep going, get iron!
All I want is diamonds
Only mining ores
Break the cobblestone
And all I want is diamonds
Only mining ores
Break the cobblestone

[Ending, spoken]

[Introduction, spoken]
Hey. OK.
I got this requested in the comments of... of my video
and I, yeah, I just wanna do this, I'm gonna do this song now
Uh. It's called Africa by Toto
I can't remember the name of the guy who requested it but
Alright, We're gonna do this song
Here we go

Here we go

[Verse 1]
I see the diamonds shining in the light
where you see *inaudible* of obsidian
I'm going down into the mine
With beautiful diamonds that reflect everything that crosses them
I stopped to mine some cobblestone
hoping i'll mine deeper, find more of these diamonds
I turned around to suddenly see

[Intro]
Calling all staff, arrows shot
Arrows shot in front of the mineshaft
There's about to be some TNT blowing up
Send all the available admins
Send in the moderators
Send in the MVP's
Send in the owners
Send in the... frick

[Verse 1]
I wanna find ores
'Cause I mined and I wanna dig all this
But it's cool, after digging it, I'll mined all the lapis
Oh no, you getting mad?
Gonna knock the diamonds right into the lava?
That is extremely absurd
And now you wanna be the cynosure?
You talk like you finding no ores, ayy
Is that a diamond or lapis, ayy
Say that to your MVP's face, ayy
How you cheated on Sky Wars
Ayy, you look afraid, must have seen a charged creeper
Maybe you run away or fight if you have armor

[Verse 2]
Woo, you've just been griefing
Ever since your little TNT blew up
Let staff you know you did it all
That you're capable to blow up all of my house
That's bad, that I saw you trying to grief my house
I was more disappointed that when I found out
I hit 200k
Man gotta mine
Gotta mine, mine, mine
'Cause when you don't have a mansion, replace it with a diamond
You really don't see your friends hop in a mine
Hoping to join, they're so tired of getting griefed
Over and over and over and over and over again

[Verse 3]
"Oh my gosh, you are a hacker
You make me so mad with your endless griefing
You're on the blacklist now, you dummy
Now go to the nether and heck off!"
You're messing up the server, so try your best to remember
You're not a player, all you are is a griefer
Let's find the block of day, but which one is it?
An exploding mass of fire, it’s a TNT block!
You're like Sethbling, without the talent
Like Lionmaker, but a bigger pedo
You're like MinecraftKing but, no, wait you're exactly like MinecraftKing

[Bridge]
Do you wanna grief the server?
But dude, you're gonna be banned soon
How can you grief all the stuff
But you're too scared to do it on Mineplex?

[Verse 4]
Little noob, little jerk
Forgot to finish writing this lyric
Admit that you're just hacking
[inaudible]
(Get it, because you're a hacker, this is what you wanted right?)
(Hey, I'm gonna grief the server with my cheats from 2005!)
Holy sheep, you're as predictable as a noob's house
To call you just a griefer would be an insult to the hackers

[Verse 5]
Whatever you said you’d grief, you did
You've done too much, you're sick, just quit, that's it
You're a— you're a hippo, here's what I predict
You're a killing spree that will go attended- unattended
How— how can the griefer
Just not know they've griefed too much?
But let me guess, you're crying, trying to get unbanned but that won't work
When you're done, at least before so much, you're just like the average griefer dude
You're a bad griefer
You've done too much, you're sick and that's that
So now I think you're just a coal in the mineshaft

[Outro]
Got diamonds, emeralds and the gold and I dig
And you're still gonna be a little noob
Now I'm finished as planned
It was just three minutes and it was pretty bad
So I got a question to ask you dude:
You wanna get banned too?

[Spoken Word]
We'll mine again
Don't know where, don't know when
But I know we'll mine again
In some dark cave

[Chorus]
We'll mine again
Don't know where, don't know when
But I know we'll mine again
In some dark cave

[Verse 1]
Keep mining through
Just like you used to do
'Till your Diamond Pickaxe breaks
And you get a new one
Oh, won't you please mine some more
Diamonds for me
It doesn't take long
I'll be happy to know
That as you saw me mine
I was mining diamonds

[Chorus]
We'll mine again
Don't know where, don't know when
But I know we'll mine again
In some dark cave
We'll mine again
Don't know where, don't know when
But I know we'll mine again
In some dark cave

[Verse 2]
Keep mining through
Just like you used to do
'Till your Diamond Pickaxe breaks
And you get a new one
Oh, won't you please mine some more
Diamonds for me
It doesn't take long
I'll be happy to know
That as you saw me mine
I was mining diamonds

[Chorus]
We'll mine again
Don't know where, don't know when
But I know we'll mine again
In some dark cave

Verse 1:
Member that house I built?
Or did you just burn it down?
I didn't even put up a fight
Didn’t need to see it go down
Found a way to become a mod
I knew how the entire time
Now I can ban you here
I’ve got my permissions now
It’s like it’s my time to SHINE
Every rule you were breaking
Time that it’s come now

Chorus:
I’m gonna have to ban you now
I've started typing in the command
I’m surrounded by your distress
Know that the command is typing
Well now you know you deserve this
We don't need you anymore
It’s written all over your status
Fly hacking is not allowed
Not in my Minecraft server
?????
Banned you
I’ve banned who
I banned you
Can't you see I banned you
I banned you (With voice crack)

Verse 2:
??????
I won't fall for that
You're not the only person I've banned
Think you could escape this now
I swore I will never unban you
Oh wait who is that in the distance
I really can believe my eyes.
How are you back in
It’s like it’s my time to shine!
Every hour you are breaking
??????

2nd Chorus:
I’ve banned you
I’m gonna have to ban you now
I've started typing in the command
I’m surrounded by your distress
Know that the command is typing
Well now you know you deserve this
I’ve banned you
Can't you see i’ve banned you

Banned you

Can't you see I’ve banned you
I banned YOUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU! (with voice cracks)

Can't you see I BANNED YOUUUUUUUUUUUUUU  (with voice crack)
Literally screaming
I banned you
I BANNED YOU (screaming)
I BANNED YOU (sing like a donkey getting executed)
Again start screaming like you got kidnapped
(emotional crying)

Chorus 3:
I started typing in the command
Surrounded by your disgrace
Now that the command is typed in
You know that you deserve this
We don't need you anymore
Its written all over your status
For hacking is not allowed
Not in my Minecraft Server
Ive banned you
Banned you
Can’t you see I banned you
Banned you
Banned who?
Banned you
Can’t you see I banned you

Banned youuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu


THATS RIGHT NO CHEATERS ON THIS SERVER! (End it with a cancerous laugh)

Do you remember
We were mining a mine in September
Noteblocks playing all night, no creepers
While we kept the zombies away

Pickaxe not breaking
In the star that our swords were swinging
As we mined all the ores, remember
How the skeleton horse was away!

[Chorus]
Ah, ha, ha, badiya, do you guys remember
Badiya, mining in September
Badiya, never was a dead-end cave

Badudu dadudu antsudu adudu
Badudu badudu, badidi dadu
Badede badede, badiye adede
Yeah

My ores are with me
Staying safe at home from danger
No more coal and lapiz, remember
How we mined diamonds night and day

[?]
Putting ores in our chest and our tools
No more coals and Lapiz, remember
The ores we will all share today

[Chorus]
Ah, ha, ha, badiya, do you guys remember
Badiya, mining in September
Badiya, never was a dead-end cave

Badudu badudu, say do you remember
Badudu badudu, mining in September
Badudu, badudu, never was a dead-end cave

-diya, mining in September
Badiya, never was a dead-end cave

Badiya, mining in September
Badiya, do you guys remember
Badiya, playing noteblocks night and day

Badiya, say do you remember
Badiya, mining in September
Badiya, never was a dead-end cave

Ba, da, badudu, dadudu
Ba, da (yeah), badudu, badudu
Badudu, yade, badudu, badede, yeah

My heart is paralyzed
My house was oversized
I take the high mine like I should
You said it's meant to be
The creeper blew up you - not me
You died and that would know
That's fine but if my friends don't see you there I'm gonna say:

She was hit by a Spider
Fell into lava
She got hit by a Ghast inside the nether
Help me, help me
I'm no good with mines
She met a Guardian in the water
Fell and missed the water
I took back all the diamonds I had got her
Help me, Help me
I just can't survive
And I'm so sad you died

Noises
Ahem

I do still feel the same
You did most everything
Someday I'll find another player
You think I did it all
Not had you take that fall
How could you die so close to the end
That's fine but if my friends don't see you there I'm gonna say

She was bitten by a Zombie
Hoarded by Pigmen
Got run over by a cart inside a mineshaft
Help me help me
I'm not good with mines

She looked right at an Enderman
Shot by a skeleton
Drown to death at the water temple
Help me, help me
I just can't SURVIVE
And I'm so sad you died
You died
Inhale
You died

I hope this world wasn't on hardcore
I wanna be the player you're lookin' for
Miiiinenin'
But you are too good
That's fine but if my friends don't see you there I'm gonna say
Let's fine but if my friends don't see you there I'm gonna say:

She was hit by a Spider
Fell into lava
She got hit by a Ghast inside the nether
Help me help me
I'm no good with mines
She met a Guardian in the water
Fell and missed the water
I took back all the diamonds I have got her
Help me, help me
I just can't survive

She was bitten by a Zombie
Hoarded by Pigmen
Got run over by a cart inside a mineshaft
Help me, help me
I'm no good with mines

[Verse 1]
How can you see into the mine, without fail?
Crawling down deeper with a diamond pickaxe
Returning to torches my diamonds resting safe at home
Until I find them in the [?]

[Chorus]
Stop cheating
Stop using X-rays
Stop cheating
I just want you to stop it
I just want a diamond (What)
Stop cheating, save some ore for me
Stop cheating
I just have a piece (Stop it)
You already have a stack of diamonds

[Verse 2]
Now that I know you have hacks
I won't let go
You will just keep mining more and more
Without any fail

[Chorus]
Stop cheating
Stop using X-rays
Stop cheating
I just want you to stop it
You know where all of the diamonds are
Stop cheating
Save some ore for me
Stop cheating
I just wanna, win? (Stop it)
You already have a stack of diamonds

[Bridge]
Won't somebody stop?
You stupid noob
You have my stuff
But how
You won't be gone here
Without cheats you'll maybe understand
[?]
All the diamonds are right here infront of me
I'm hunting diamonds for 100 years it seems
I need to open my mind
[?]
There must be more ggooooollllldddd

[Chorus]
Stop cheating
Stop using X-rays
Stop it
You just want to know where diamonds are
*inaudible*
I just have a please a please stop it
You won't have any diamonds so calm down man
Stop using X-ray
Stop using X-ray

[Verse 1]
I want these trees cut down and made into planks
No forests anymore I've got to build this
I see you hissing by walking to blow up my house
I have to kill you 'fore my house gets blown up

[Verse 2]
I see a bunch of caves and they're all dead ends
With pickaxes and shovels to break and put back
I see the diamonds down in that lava pit
I have to build a bridge and then quickly mine it

[Verse 3]
I look into a cave and see that one is dead
We have to gear up more before we go to the End
But then one fades away a creeper blew them up
It's not easy playing this you must have your skill up

[Verse 4]
No more will we die now, we're going to the nether
I couldn't foresee anyone dying to this
If I wish hard enough we'll beat the End Dragon
My team will rise together before we go to the end

[Verse 5]
We need these diamonds so that we can make armor
The bright blue chestplate will suit me forever
I see it coming out but then my [?] dies
Only three heroes left, I hope we will beat these guys

[Verse 6]
I wanna see you beat it, shoot it now
With your bow, enchanted
And see the dragon erased from this game
I wanna sea you beat it, beat it, beat it, shoot it now (yeah)
I wanna sea you beat it, beat it, beat it, shoot it now (yeah)

[Intro]
Hi Guys, sorry its been so long since my last parody. But Um I'm back and I am here to uh record this one

[Verse 1]
I mine this endless cave, the only cave that I have ever known
Don't know how deep it goes, but its only me and I mine alone
I mine all of these ores in my mineshaft of broken picks
Where the spiders creep and i'm the only one and I mine alone
(I mine alone I mine alone)
(I mine alone I mine a–)

[Chorus]
My pickaxe is the only one that stays beside me
My minecart is the only thing that moves me
Sometimes I wish that notch would come down and guide me
Till then I mine alone

[Bridge]
Zombies, Spiders, Creepers, Ahh-ahh-ah
Strongholds, Dungeons, Lava
I'm digging down the mine, then I spot a familiar shine
I found some diamonds on the edge and I found the lava
Enchant all the time, whats goofed up is I get up at the chime, checking for my mobs so I can mine and I mine alone
I mine alone I mine alone
I mine alone I mine a

[Verse 2]
I mine this endless cave, the only cave that I have ever known
Don't know how deep it goes, but its only me and I mine alone
I mine all of these ores in my mineshaft of broken picks
Where the spiders creep and i'm the only one and I mine alone
(I mine alone I mine alone)
(I mine alone I mine a)

[Chorus]
My pickaxe is the only one that stays beside me
My minecart is the only thing that moves me
Sometimes I wish that notch would come down and guide me
Till then I mine alone

[Outro]
Zombies, Spiders, Creepers, Ahh-ahh-ah
Strongholds, Dungeons, Lava
I'm digging down the mine, then I spot a familiar shine
I found some diamonds on the edge and I found the lava
Enchant all the time, whats goofed up is I get up at the chime, checking for my mobs so I can mine and I mine alone
(I mine alone I mine alone)
(I mine alone I mine a)

[Intro]
Hey guys I've been gone for a while but I’m back with another Minecraft parody

[Chorus]
I got a Diamond Hoe
I love it
I got a Diamond Hoe, I love it
I got a Diamond Hoe, I love it

[Verse 1]
Your house is bout to blow to rubble
I just pulled up with a bow
Griefed your house up in that jungle
And stole all of your iron and diamonds
I don't know nothing
My pigs be gettin' ignorant
Like a flint and steel we ignite
All these arrows in my neck
Lookin’ like I just fought a skeleton
So much diamonds in my chest now
Ow, frick!
Where's the mine?
Me and my wolfie sippin' pots
Ow, frick!
Herobrine!

[Chorus]
I got a diamond hoe, I love it
I got a diamond hoe, I love it
I got a diamond hoe, I love it

[Verse 2]
When the first time they ask you
If you wanted haste or speed
Are you tryin' to act like you was
Craftin' beacons 'fore you came out here

[Chorus]
I'm sick frick
I like a quick kick
I'm sick frick
I like a quick kick
I’m sick frick
I like a quick kick
I’m sick frick
I like a quick kick

[Verse 3]
Ran out of sticks
I'll buy you some bricks
I’ll buy you a new pick
I'll blow you with a click
How you start a new farm
You don't have no pigs
I'm a sick frick, I hoard diamond blocks
I like mining diamonds
I like those noteblocks
I wanna hear noteblocks
I’ll play those noteblocks
Craft me mo' noteblocks
With these wooden logs

[Chorus]
I got a diamond hoe, I love it
I got a diamond hoe, I love it

[Verse]
Right from the start
you were a thief you stole my diamonds
and you still looked inside

The rest is incomprehensible due to the artist choosing the real version of a song instead of an instrumental one

Uh Uh
We're out of diamonds
I'm mining your
Woah diamonds
I'm mining your
Get out
I am mining where you are
You stole all my diamonds
You are not very cool
And I
I got only 2pics
One iron block
Two sticks
The sandblocks you made me
Like all the time
You brought this on yourself
Now face it
I'm gonna make a diamond sword
And prove you
But what about friends
Please don't blow up my world
What about friends
You took all of my diamonds
What about friends
What about us in the end
What about friends
When we fight the ender dragon
What about friends
What about friends
Why
Why did you set my house
On fire with flint n' steel
You used to let me build
Uhh
Why
Why are you doing this
Because I got diamonds
Personally
I think it's more than that way (?)
You brought this on yourself
Now face it
I'm gonna make a diamond sword
Apon you
But what about friends
Please don't blow up my world
What about friends
You took all of my diamonds
What about friends
What about us in the end
What about friends
When we fight the ender dragon
What about friends (x10)
You brought this on yourself
Now face it
I'm going to make a diamond sword
Apon you
You brought this on yourself
Now face it
I'm gonna make a
Diamond sword
And rekk u
But what about friends
Please don't blow up my world
What about friends
You took all of my diamonds
What about friends
What about us in the end
What about friends
When we fight the ender dragon
What about friends (x5)

[Verse 1]
Mining
I'm swinging my pickaxe from left to right,
Mining
I usually get more diamonds but it's alright
It made me put away my sword
Crafting
You made a miner wait to get his, armor
I made a diamond sword with that,
Enchanting
I'm wishing I could make a mine

[Pre-Chorus]
If you want it
You can mine it
If you craft it
We can build it
If you want it
You can mine it

[Chorus]
But just mine
Creepers hissin'
They gon' find you
Blow up your house
But just mine
Creepers hissin'
Now swing your diamond sword

[Intro (Spoken)]
Hi guys!
I'm here doing a Minecraft parody of break my stride,
It's called Break My Mine!

Alright,

*cough cough*
*cough*

Alright,
I'm gonna do it now

[Verse 1]
Last night I found so much diamonds
I dug my way to lava
But I got up and stopped it,
And then there were some zombies right there,
So I swung my sword and stopped them
So I escaped and I sang,

[Chorus]
"Ain't nothing gonna break my mine,
Ain't nothing gonna kill me now!
Oh no, I've got to keep on mining!
Ain't nothing gonna break my mine,
I'm mining and I won't get dirt!
Oh no, I've got to get the diamonds!"

[Verse 2]
I'm almost home and I'm running fast
I ran past all the creepers
stopped going heeper jeepers
I see my house and now i'm walking to it
So I crafted a noteblock and played it nicely
As I sang,

[Chorus]
"Ain't nothing gonna break my mine,
Ain't nothing gonna kill me now!
Oh no, I've got to keep on mining!
Ain't nothing gonna break my mine,
I'm mining and I won't get dirt!
Oh no, I've got to get the diamonds!"

(Instrumental)

[Verse 3]
Never mining the other dirt,
Get the diamonds!
Never mining the other cobble,
Get the iron!
Never mining the other coal,
Get the redstone!
I'll mine the other diamonds and I'll get them

[Chorus]
"Ain't nothing gonna break my mine,
Ain't nothing gonna kill me now!
Oh no, I've got to keep on mining
Ain't nothing gonna break my mine,
I'm mining and I won't get dirt!
Oh no, I've got to get the diamonds!"

[Chorus]
"Ain't nothing gonna break my mine
Ain't nothing gonna kill me now!
Oh no, I've got to keep on mining!
Ain't nothing gonna break my mine,
I'm mining and I won't get dirt!
Oh no, I've got to get the diamonds!"

[Chorus]
"Ain't nothing gonna break my mine,
Ain't nothing gonna kill me now!
Oh no I've got to keep on mining!"

Alright, thanks guys!

Alright, here's my Christmas special - for Minecraft!

(clears throat)

Alright, here we go.

Minecraft pathways, cobble pathways,
Covering minecraft halls!
In the Minecra-a-ft air there's a feeling of Christmas!

Diamond mining, miners grinding,
With the new elytras,
And I'm all really mine you will find...

...Diamond mine! Diamond mine!
It's Christmas time in Minecraft!
Mine and mine! Hear the mine! Soon we will find
Diamond mines.

(exhales)

Watch the lamplights,
And the glowstone,
Light up this Minecraft town.
And the miners get home before the Creepers.

Hear the hissing,
But we can't hurt,
Because homes are secure,
With cactuses a-a-all
'round them.

Diamond mine! Diamond mine!
It's Christmas time in Minecraft!
Mine the mine! Soon we'll find,
Di-i-ia-mond mines!

Soon we'll find,
Diamond mines!

Merry Christmas everybody!

[Introduction, spoken]
Hi guys, I'm back, and before this video starts, I just want to give a shout out to Grandayy1899 for helping me with this
He made the instrumental for this song, even though it's not an original Minecraft song, he just made the instrumental for it, uh, and his channel is in the description, and so is his twitter, so just check him out, and, uh, thanks!

[Verse 1]
Crafting, Diamond Armor
For the battle, that is way up ahead
And the zombies, are well dead now
No more spiders, and the creepers are dead
Signs, read the stories
Of Herobrine
And the bad creatures
Its invasion, warfare nation
What a boom it made, when it all went off
Watching, from the cliff
Above the ravine
Waiting for them again
Hissing, but no creepers
Oh no what's that thing, going off

[Chorus]
I'm TNT, I'm griefing
I'm blowing up your world
Sand and gunpowder
Going boom
Deep inside, the abandoned mine

[Verse 2]
Crafting diamond tools
For the battle, that is way below coal
Building, another portal
So that we can, escape from all this
Blazes, and the spawners
Magnum cubes, chasing that all is here
Its invasion, warfare nation
What a boom it made, when it all went off

[Chrorus]
I'm TNT, I'm griefing
I'm blowing up your world
Sand and gunpowder
Going boom
Deep inside the abandoned mine
(coughing and instrumental)
TNT, I'm griefing
I'm blowing up your world
Sand and gunpowder
Deep inside the abandoned mine
(more coughing)

[Outro, spoken]
Alright, thanks guys! Thanks for 75k!
Uh, the 100k special is coming up, and might hit it in a couple days
So, uh, thanks guys and bye!

[Verse 1]

You would not believe your game
If ten million diamond ores
Glew in the mine as I went to sleep
'Cause they fill the mine that mines
And leave diamonds everywhere
You think I'd stay but I would just go and mine

[Chorus]

I'd love to get some on my game
For my diamond armor
It's nice to have so much time getting fortunes once in a week
'Cause all this stuff is too much for me

[Verse 2]

'Cause I'd make diamond armor
And build a diamond house
As I killed creepers with my diamond sword
A diamond sword for some defense
And a diamond under my bed
All the mobs are around me for my death

[Chorus]

I'd love to get some on my game
For my diamond armor
It's nice to have so much time getting fortunes once in a week
'Cause all this stuff is too much for me (if I mine so deep)

[Bridge]
Leave some diamonds just for my friends
'Cause I feel like shaming
Why am I tried of dreaming sheep?
When I'm far too tired to mine deep

[Verse 3]

To ten million diamond ores
It's weird 'cause I hate emerald
I got much less done than doing more
Well I know where several are
If my mine gets too deep
'Cause I have enough in an open mine

[Chorus]

I'd love to get some on my game
For my diamond armor
It's nice to have so much time getting fortunes once in a week
'Cause all this stuff is too much for me (if I mine so deep)
I'd love to get some on my game
For my diamond armor
It's nice to have so much time getting fortunes once in a week
'Cause all this stuff is too much for me (if I mine so deep)
I'd love to get some on my game
For my diamond armor
It's nice to have so much time getting fortunes once in a week
'Cause all this stuff is too much for me

Oh
When in Minecraft
I was mining some ores in a dark coal tunnel
And I can't help but to hear
No I can't help but to hear a creeper hissing
I thought this was the end
So I hold up the sword and says(said)
Come get me you creeper
But what a shame
What a shame that he fell right in front of me..

[Verse 1]
In The mine again
Just can’t wait to get in the mine again
The life I love is playing Minecraft with my friends
And I can’t wait to get in the mine again
In The mine again
Going deeper than i’ve ever been
Finding Caves that I may never see again
And I can’t wait to get in the mine again

[Chorus}
In the mine again
Like a pack of griefers blowing up the Mineshafts
We mine everything
And maybe we might just go find a diamond
All the diamonds

[Verse 2]
In The mine again
Just can’t wait to get in the mine again
The life I love is playing Minecraft with my friends
And I can’t wait to get in the mine again

[BREAK]

[Chorus}
In the mine again
Like a pack of griefers blowing up the Mineshafts
We mine everything
And maybe we might just go find a diamond
All the diamonds

[Verse 3]
In The mine again
Just can’t wait to get in the mine again
The life I love is playing Minecraft with my friends
And I can’t wait to get in the mine again
And I can’t wait to get in the mine again

I never thought I would find so many ores
I found a cave, I found a cave
I always thought that i'd get killed by zombies
I found a cave, I found a cave
If you start digging right now
You'll see whats inside
Its gonna take some time to find diamonds
But if you dig inside I'm sure you'll find
Inside your mineshaft i told you that i will be always never be Mining straight down
Diamonds all around
Dudududududu

"Hey guys, I'm back again with another video for you"

This is Minecraft, for the fallen mobs, left to kill all the innocent players
The creepers, zombies, and lava, and the skeleton dungeonsOh-woah-woah-oh-oh, Oh-woah-woah-oh-oh]
The sharpness 4 and fire aspect will help us kill the mobs, but they haven't seen the best of our skills
If you love ores let me mine!
If you love ores let me mine!
Cuz' this gold isn’t good enough to craft swords, the fear of dying from mobs, and truth be told I don't have a shield the fear of dying from mobs
The fear of dying from mobs
This is Minecraft, for the griefing ones, x-rays, and the fricking hackers
Banned for killing everyone, but it's cool [?]
[?]
The enchantments [?]
But we have to kill the Ender Dragon
If you love ores let me mine!
If you love ores let me mine!
Cuz' this gold isn’t good enough to craft swords, the fear of dying from mobs, and truth be told I don't have a shield the fear of dying from mobs
The fear, the fear of dying from mobs
The fear of dying from mobs
The fear of dying from mobs
The fear of dying from mobs
The fear of dying from mobs
The fear, the fear of dying from mobs

[Intro]
Hi guys, happy Valentine's Day
Umm this is a song... anyways, here's Wonderwall

[Verse 1]
Today is gonna be the day that I blow mine more diamonds
By now I don't know somehow but I don't have enough
I don't believe that anybody has too much diamonds at least for now
Down there in the mine appears a creeper so shout it out
I'm sure you've all been in a war with a creeper before you've been out
I don't believe that anybody hasn't seen the mob or anything

[Chorus]
And all the caves we have to mine are gloomy
And all my swords up in my chest are crummy
There are many ores that I would really like to mine
But i don't know how

Because maybe
Your gonna be the one who mines me
We'll build so tall
With our diamond wall

[Verse 2]
Today is gonna be the day but I'll won't mine anymore diamonds
By now I don't how somehow I still don't have enough
I don't believe that anybody has too much diamonds
At least for now

[Chorus]
And all the caves we have to mine are gloomy
And all my swords up in my chest are crummy
There are many ores that I would really like to mine
But i don't know how

Because maybe
Your gonna be the one who mines me
We'll build so tall
With our diamond wall

{Verse #1}
I was griefed again today
And the guy he called me a homosexual
I think he's just mad
Because he's just bad
And he isn't very rad
But okay
I got griefed again today

[Chorus]
I will get my diamonds back whatever it takes
And I know it seems kinda risky but I'm going to take it
And if I die
I won't cry
I will stand right up and fly
But for now
I'm gonna get my diamonds back
Gonna get my diamonds back

*clears throat*

{Verse 2}
I got griefed again today
I could tell he was a greifer by the way he played
When I got off
He got on
He griefed my house there was nothing its gone
I lost my diamonds
I lost my ores
I'm all depressed now
And now I'm poor

[Chorus]
I will get my diamonds back whatever it takes
And I know it seems kinda risky but I'm going to take it
And if I die
I won't cry
I will stand right up and fly
But for now
I'm gonna get my diamonds back
Gonna get my diamonds back

{Verse 3}
I got griefed again today
Pumpkin Pie
I won't cry
I will stand right up and fly
I'm gonna get my diamonds back
I lost my ores, I lost all of it and now
I'm poor

{Chorus}
I will get my diamonds back whatever it takes
And I know it seems kinda risky but I'm willing to take it
And if I die
I won't cry
I will stand right up and fly
But for now
I'm gonna get my diamonds back
Gonna get my diamonds back
Gonna get my diamonds back
I'm gonna get my diamonds back
I'm gonna get my diamonds back
I'm gonna get my diamonds back

Alright thanks guys!

[Verse 1]
Uh, open up the potions, pop!
It's my mine come on, mine it up!
Hear a hiss behind the door and the night begins
Creepers done this before, I never let 'em in
Pack up your inventory, 'n' we can go out
Bring some extra food so that you don't starve
Sometimes you forget torches
And you gotta bring your pickaxe
Yeah, you know where we goin'
Sometimes you forget torches

[Chorus]
Welcome to my mine, we are mining diamonds
We ain't gonna strip mine
We don't have to fight mobs
Welcome to my mine
Play that noteblock nicely
Show me all those emeralds
We don't gotta dodge lava
Welcome to my mine, welcome to my mine

[Verse 2]
When it comes and you know that you wanna stay
Block dirt, let's start mining those real things
Keep those swords in our hands, and open up those potions
Let's fight those mobs, come on slash away
Sometimes you forget torches
And you gotta bring a pickaxe
Yeah, we know where we going
Sometimes you forget torches

[Chorus]
Welcome to my mine, we are mining diamonds
We don't gotta strip mine, we don't have to fight mobs
Welcome to my mine,play that noteblock nicely
Show me all those emeralds,we don't gotta dodge lava... (pause)
Welcome to my mine, welcome to my...

[Outro and "Rap" part]
Welcome to my strip mine, the mine, the cave, the crack
My mine is your mine, treating it right
Sorry if my mine don't have the gold
As soon as I dig down I will find more of that
Oh, my goodness, what is that?
Azul brillante, guapo, so we're going to mine that
I think I know what that is
O.M.G it's diamonds!

[Chorus]
Welcome to my mine, we will mine diamonds
We don't gotta strip mine
We don't gotta fight mobs
Welcome to my mine, play that noteblock nicely
Show me all those emeralds
We don't gotta dodge lava
Welcome to my mine, welcome to my mine, welcome to my mine
Hah, yeah!

Hi Guys today, im gonna be sing Star MINECRAFT PARODY
Wait This Time its Alex, by its by Grace Potter

{Verse 1}
I lit a fire with a touch in the mine
It burned big, and got knocked up by the creepers
I followed the gunpowder into some gold
I want diamonds, not stupid butter

{Chorus}
I cant look at ores, they make me wonders if there is more
Ores, up on the Stronghold.
I know Steve, he took the ores already.
So I cant look at the ores.
*muffed screaming*

{Verse 2}
All those times coursed to the mines.
Looking in so far, you almost fell in once and me too.
The ores surround me and by mobs.
The lava is glowing but I cant see the ores.

{Chorus}
I cant look at the ores, they make me wonders if there is more
Ores, up on the Stronghold.
I know Steve, he took the ores already.
So I cant look  at the ores.
*muffed screaming*

{Verse 3}
Diamonds, ores, gold, butter, iron, coal
*breathing*

{Outro}
OO-oores, they wonder if there is more.
OO-oores, up on the Stronghold.
I know Steve, he took the all ores already.
So I cant look at the ores.

[Introduction, spoken]
We'll mine again
Don't know where, don't know when
But I know we'll mine again
In some dark cave

[Chorus]
We'll mine again
Don't know where, don't know when
But I know we'll mine again
In some dark cave

[Verse]
Keep mining through
Just like you used to do
'Till your Diamond Pickaxe breaks
And you get a new one

Oh, won't you please mine some more
Diamonds for me
It doesn't take long
I'll be happy to know
That as you saw me mine
I was mining diamonds

[Chorus]
We'll mine again
Don't know where, don't know when
But I know we'll mine again
In some dark cave

We'll mine again
Don't know where, don't know when
But I know we'll mine again
In some dark cave

[Verse]
Keep mining through
Just like you used to do
'Till your Diamond Pickaxe breaks

This is for the zombies living in the tiny little cave outside of my house
When the wither comes, he’s not gonna stay low hes gonna fly up
But I will help fight him, But I will help fight him I’m gonna help fight him

This is for the mobs and the players they kill
For the mines I’ve dug, for the endless cracks
For the warning signs I’ve completely ignored
Please don’t dig straight down, lava is the floor

It’s no big surprise you died in the end
When they attacked you and hit you away
And they broke your tools, and blew up your house
You stopped by the mine the night you escaped
With mobs all around, I asked you to stay
You said “Hey man good luck here but NO FRICKING WAY!"

I’m sure that we could find a tool for you to use all day
Maybe mine with a pickaxe or use a hoe to chop some grass

This is for the mine that me and my pals dig in
Without torches for the whole night
And it should’ve been cool but I can hear “don't mine at night” in the back of my mind
Make sure you enchant your sword before you slash and slash away
There are lessons to be learned, Consequences for all the nights where I don't stay
It’s no big surprise you died in the end
I will not be brave

I’m sure that we could find a tool for you to use all day
Maybe mine with a pickaxe or use a hoe to chop some grass

I wanna stay alive
In hardcore mode
I don’t wanna watch, and then complain
Cause I am done mining down, that is a pro tip i didn't make

She hopes i’m dead forever
Without some Cave size Diamonds
In some deadend abandoned mineshaft
My whole game
Never mining diamonds
Or Obliged to have some others
And the creepers will be many every night
Every night, Every night

Ok, guys, I'm really sick right now but I’m gonna sing my new Minecraft parody
Um ok *clears throat*
Also thanks for all the support

When you need to craft
And you don't
Have much diamonds
Or gold
Or even redstone

Your door is blocked
By a bunch of zombies
And you just can't survive
But you have one thing that will protect you
An enchantment table
Cause you are a librarian
You enchant your sword

*Clears throat* Ok um. *takes a deep breath*

Build your sword, chest, book
If you need more
Stab sword for you
Can craft
Another one
But
You can survive
If you enchant your axe
*Coughs violently*
And fight all the creepers
Cause you are a librarian
You can fight the mobs
Cause you are a librarian
You can survive

*Cough cough cough*
Ok
I’m gonna try it
I'm gonna try it

Enchant some books
Enchant more
Enchant all you have
And your Minecraft dreams will come true
See how they shine
All if you need some time
You can enchant [?]
On my [?]
You can enchant it all
Yes, you are a librarian
You saved 'em all
*breathes heavily*

Thanks for watching and thanks for twenty-five hundred subscribers

[Intro]
*clearing throat*
Hi guys
Uh, I'm sorry I've been gone for so long but I'm doing another Minecraft parody
Uh, this one is of Moving Out
Uh, okay, here

[Verse 1]
Steve works in the ore trading store
Saving his diamonds for someday
One day, Notch left a note on the door
He said, "Steve, go mine out to the ravines"
Oh, but mining too hard could get you killed good by mo-mo-mo-mo-mo-mobs
You oughta know by now
Who needs to mine right next to lava?
All that is just for one diamond

[Chorus]
And it seems like a dangerous job
And that's what I'm mining for
Now if Notch that's digging up, then I'm mining out
I'm mining out

[Post-Chorus]
Mmm, mmm-mmm
Ah, ah

[Verse 2]
Alex the miner is digging for flint
At night she becomes a cool raider
She works with a really big faction
Down by the waterfall
Their base has over eighty chests but they're overrated
You oughta know by now
And if you can't mine with no pickaxe
At least you can chop down a forest

[Chorus]
And it seems like a dangerous job
And that's what I'm mining for
Not much if that's digging up, then I'm mining out
Mmm, I'm mining out

[Post-Chorus]
Ooh, ooh
Ah, ah

[Verse 3]
You should never challenge a crazy griefer
You oughta know by now
You can take away all of their TNT
But they could just come back and kill you

[Chorus]
And it seems like a dangerous job
And that's what I'm mining for
Not much if that's digging up, then I'm mining out
Mmm, I'm mining out

[Post-Chorus]
Ooh, ooh
Ah, ah

[Outro]
Mmm
*clearing throat*
Mining out
*clearing throat*

[Verse 1]
Enderdragon in my direction
Many xp, it's such a blessin', yeah
Use all the xp to enchant my armor, yeah
Ohh ohh, I
Try to sleep on the darkest days
But the mobs are in the way
Gotta kill them so I can go to bed (bed)
This armors really comfy when I put it on
Change it to peaceful so I'm not killed when I spawn
I see a village that is near, the only sounds I wanna hear
Are the villagers when I trade them some gear
Smelt
Smelt the iron so I can get some metal
Make an iron pickaxe to mine the rare ores
You know that I gotta mine all these diamonds
Oh yeah
Yeah!
Need a lot of food on this hard adventure
Should I cook the pig or the cow?
I'm not sure
Maybe I should make a cake for my hunger

[Chorus]
Minecraftcito
Where you need to survive all day and all night
Craft a diamond sword so you can fight
Place a torch in a cave to produce some light
Minecraftcito
Kill the creeper before it blows my house
But it blew up so I gotta move out
Don't have food so I'm fishing to catch a trout
Killin' people in Hunger Games to get the victory
Trolling people on some servers
Lava their house cause I'm a griefer (I'm a griefer I'm a griefer baby)
Taming wolves with my bones cause I need lots of help
When these mobs try to kill me
My doggies can attack them

[Verse 2]
To make survival you need armor bro
A pickaxe and wooden hoe
Diamond sword but do not show
Don't flex on these haters bro
Make a farm and build a house so creepers won't kill you
Go to the Nether but don't hit pigmans, they will kill you
Get a lot of blaze powder and make the Eye of Ender
Find the Ender portal and put the eyes in the frames
After that grab your bow and diamond sword, yeah don't hide that
You are one step away from completing Minecraft

[Pre-Chorus]
Exploring exploring to some other biomes
We're at another place, changing up the timezones
See a witch in a swamp, ocelot on top
Of a tree, I'm gonna feed it some fish
Exploring exploring to some other biomes
We're at another place, changing up the timezones
Use a boat to travel to different places
Skeletons attacking me, gotta make a base oh yeah

[Chorus]
Minecraftcito
Where you need to survive all day and all night
Craft a diamond sword so you can fight
Place a torch in a cave to produce some light
Minecraftcito
Kill the creeper before it blows my house
But it blew up so I gotta move out

Killin' people in Hunger Games to get the victory

Taming wolves with my bones cause I need lots of help
When these mobs try to kill me
My doggies can attack them

[Chorus]
Minecraftcito
This is how we do it down in the mineshaft
I just wanna hear you say "I love Minecraft"
See a creeper you know that I gotta strike that (you know)
Exploring exploring to some other biomes
We're at another place, changing up the timezones
See a witch in a swamp, ocelot on top
Of a tree, I'm gonna feed it some fish
Exploring exploring to some other biomes
When these mobs try to kill me
My doggies can attack them

Georgie
No, no, no, no
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no
No, no, no, no

[Chorus: ReptileLegit]
I still see your armor in my room
Can't take back the diamonds I gave you
It's to the point where I steal and I grief you
And I cannot help you to survive Minecraft, oh
See a mob, we just run
Tnt just for fun
Listened to Alex instead of you Steve
You found an ocelot, but I found three doggies
I won't let you raid from me
I still see your armor in my room
Can't take back the diamonds I gave you
It's to the point where I steal and I grief you
And I cannot help you to survive Minecraft, oh
See a mob, we just run
Tnt just for fun
Listened to Alex instead of you Steve
You found an ocelot, but I found three doggies
I won't let you raid from me

[Verse: Galaxy Goats]
You left me falling and landing inside lava
I know that you want me dead
I take these potions to make me heal up my Steve
I know it's all in my chest
I have these Minecraft dreams where I can't move my pick
Thinking of you in my cave
You were my minecrafter
Thoughts of a diamond house
Now I'm just better off dead
I'll mine it over again
I lost my ores in the end
I watched ores burn in the lava
I should've listened to my Steves
Leave them ores in the chest, but I wanted to mine more
You were made out of iron ores, fake
I was tangled up in your griefing way
Who knew Herobrine had the prettiest face
You gave me some ores that were full of mistakes
I gave you my pick and you made my pick break

[Bridge: Galaxy Goats & ReptileLegit]
You made my pick break
You made my pick ache (I still see your armor in my room)
You made my pick break
You made my pick ache (Can't take back the diamonds I gave you)
You made my pick break (You were made out of iron ores, fake)
You made my pick ache (You were made out of iron ores, fake)
You made my pick break again (I was tangled up in your griefing ways)
(Who knew Herobrine had the prettiest face)

[Chorus: ReptileLegit]
I still see your armor in my room
Can't take back the diamonds I gave you
It's to the point where I steal and I grief you
And I cannot help you to survive Minecraft, oh
See a mob, we just run
Tnt just for fun
Listened to Alex instead of you Steve
You found an ocelot, but I found three doggies
I won't let you raid from me
I still see your armor in my room

[Outro: Galaxy Goats & ReptileLegit]

[Intro: Wonder]
Ayy
Uh, okay
Bih vibes
Yun Head, Obama loves you
Ayy, ayy

[Verse 1: Wonder]
Okay, my bitch look like Icky Vicky
Make Cosmo pull up with the blicky
Poof poof on a bitch if they get to shifting
Dinkleberg is a snake, better stop the hissing
Okay, fuck, bitch, better make me bust quick
And I will not let them on my shoulders when I run shit
Okay, to meet Mrs. Turner is now my only wish
I hope she take the dick
I need big drip, yes, please, diamond teeth in me
I got Jahcoin stacking up like cheese
Wonder, that's me, pass the coochie
Okay, Honda Civic, take the top off
Mr. Crocker when I cock her, I'm bending that back
If she a stalker, I'ma block her, no following back
I'm a pirate, a marauder, got booty all mapped
I bet ya' aunty take my hot dog

[Verse 2: ReptileLegit]
Bitch, go look at these Benjis
Making so much bank, it’s heavy
I be buying Gucci, Fendi
Pull up in a purple Bentley
I hit her with a poop sock
Steal your boyfriend's dread locks
Pull her weave while wearing crocs
I do no race, I only walk
I wish for a Lambo, I wish for some pancakes
I wish for my dog and I to have a cool handshake
I wish for some baked salami
Got the strap, so call me "Mommy"
I wish for a futa who can give brain like a zombie
All of you already know, if you don't, then go suck my toes
I’m whippin' bars up in this stove
Your boyfriend's got a tiny chode
He doesn’t even bust a load
I run him over on the road
You know we going Sicko Mode
It’s RLegit, Wonder and MOL$

[Verse 3: MOL$]
Oddparents, foreign whip
In a mansion with my clique
Make a ransom for your bitch
Call me handsome, we pull up
In a phantom, but my doors
Suicide, butterfly, play it nice
See my ice, can't entice for your life
Nothin' nice, take it twice, no, take your fuckin' life
Captain Price, gamer time, large fries, chocolate shake
Oddparents, fairly oddparents
Skinny-bop-doop-bop-bop-bop-bop-bop
Oddparents, fairly oddparents
Skinny-bop-doop-bop-bop-bop-dop-bop

[Intro: Minecraft King27]
Get to mine no...
Ayy, I'm in the mineshaft, bro
Oh, nah, yeah, I'm playin' Minecraft right now
Yeah, I'm playin' Minecraft, hold up

[Verse 1: Minecraft King27]
I ain't get to farm no wheat, I ain't get to mine no iron
I was stuck up in the dungeon, ain't get to see my diamonds
Ain't get to hug my Alex, couldn't even give her no kisses
Can't even go to the cave again 'cause these zombies always be hittin'
Everybody actin' suspicious, might probably say that I'm trippin'
When I'm all alone in the dungeon, I tend to eat some chicken
And all I broke is that house, don't call me no griefer
And I'ma eat all of my steak away 'cause that's the only thing that's gon' heal me
I don't understand these spiders who go around pretendin'
As if they really friendly, so at night, I keep my distance
'Cause the same pick that I'm minin' with be the main one who be breakin'
Got Strength III and Invisibility, 'cause every time

[Chorus: ReptileLegit]
I wake up in the morning, I got Minecraft on my mind
Join a couple servers, playin' SkyWars 'til I die
And all these noobies killin' me with diamond sword of Sharpness V
But I can't let 'em do it, I got Minecraft on my mind
Hey, I got Minecraft on my mind (Hey, I got Minecraft on my mind)
I got Minecraft on my mind (Minecraft on my mind)
I got Minecraft on my mind (I got Minecraft on my mind)
I got Minecraft on my mind, I got Minecraft on my mind

[Verse 2: ReptileLegit]
Diamond armor on my body, 'bout to go out to the mine
Can't even build a house without me getting traumatized
I didn't even mean to kill him, he just griefed me by surprise
I craft my diamond sword, saw him grief, then I killed him twice
His body dropped all of his items, including a pumpkin pie
He respawned at my house and left a single wooden sign
The sign said, "I'll spawn many creepers in your house next time"
And he left my griefed home, nothing but some dirt

[Chorus: ReptileLegit]
I wake up in the morning, I got Minecraft on my mind
Join a couple servers, playin' SkyWars 'til I die
And all these noobies killin' me with diamond sword of Sharpness V
But I can't let 'em do it, I got Minecraft on my mind
Hey, I got Minecraft on my mind
I got Minecraft on my mind
I got Minecraft on my mind
I got Minecraft on my mind, I got Minecraft on my mind

[Verse 3: ReptileLegit]
Fight like an enderman, see me in MLG
Hunger Games, Mega Walls, Death Run, and PVP
See all my recipes, Minecraft's the death of me
XP is 70 (Yeah, yeah)
I might just kill a mob, don't wanna kill a mob
Spawn him up, beat him up, then we gon' take his crops
I'm raidin' so good, I might do this again, I will never stop

[Outro]
You already know, I'm playin' Minecraft, not Fortnite
Minecraft on my mind, oh-whoa
I got Minecraft on my mind
I got Minecraft on my mind, I got Minecraft on my mind

[Part I]

[Intro: ReptileLegit]
Goin' on you with the pick and hoe
In Minecraft, we in Peaceful Mode

[Part II]

[Verse 1: Slim Natey]
Made this house up on a mountain with a view
At the gate outside, when mobs pull up, they get the boot
Yeah, TNT, we load the cannons, and we shoot
Blowing up your base, when we come in, give me the loot (Gimme the loot!)
Was in the tundra, we built with spruce
Livin' in the village, you such a noob
I'm the server owner, I make the rules
Now it's 4 a.m, in the cavern, minin' with the crew
I just loaded in, noobies tryna take my diamonds tools
Different colored ores, but I'm only worried 'bout the blue
With the diamond sword, playing Hunger Games with Sharpness II

[Bridge: Slim Natey]
Someone typed
You're gonna get griefed if you heck with me
Pl-Pl-Playin' 'til 3, we don't get no sleep
Someone typed
You're gonna get griefed if you heck with me
Pl-Pl-Playin' 'til 3, we don't get no sleep

[Verse 2: ReptileLegit]
This mode way too easy, beat the dragon, get the loot
I don't use no swords, I get my bow, and then I shoot
All of this food, I craft some bread and mushroom soup
I might take all my items and put them all in my mule
Hit the Nether, I see no mobs
'Bout to turn these green seeds into my crops
Don't got any items, I gotta rob
I'm in Hypixel, playing Hunger Games like I'm a boss (Don't stop, get that victory!)
Had to enchant my stuff before I die, uh
She said, "Who's that person?" It's Herobrine
We ain't even make it to the end
She thought we beat the whole game, but we spawned again
Had so many XP, now I got 10
I had emeralds, now they all got spent

[Bridge: ReptileLegit & Slim Natey]
Someone typed
Stevie griefed me out of the blue
Someone typed
Pl-Pl-Playin' 'til 3
Someone typed
We don't get no sleep

[Part III]

[Intro: ReptileLegit]
Yeah!

(Reptile, PVP these noobies up!)
Ayy, ayy

[Chorus: ReptileLegit]
Steve's in love with who I am
Back in servers, I used to build a river dam
Now I hit the mineshafts with some torches in my hands
Smelt a couple sand, diamond on my armor stand
Heading out to the mine (Ayy, yeah)
To the mine (Ayy, yeah)

[Verse 3: ReptileLegit]
To the mine, ayy, smelt in the mine, ayy
Brew in the night, ayy
Peaceful Mode is easy, man
These people leave my server, man
I still raid them in servers, man
I play a note block (Play note blocks)
Glowstone light (Glowstone light)
Hit the lights (Yeah, what?), torch is bright (Super bright)
Peaceful Mode is sweet (It is sweet), no mob on sight (Not on sight)
Cake I slice (Yeah), beat the dragon twice (Aw, nah)
Creepers fight (Yeah), Minecart turns right (Yeah)
That's what I like (Yeah), Creative Mode, we fly (Fly)
Wolves as my pets, they are a threat
I don't lose my stuff cause they're in my ender chest (Yeah)
See the meat that I cook (Ayy), finding enchant books (Ayy)
Temples in the sea
I be fighting drowners in the temples, you can't be me (Yeah, what?)
Like, "Who is she?" (Yeah, what)
Noobs are dying (Yeah, yeah)
We out here flying (Yeah)

[Chorus: ReptileLegit & Lil Cheek]
Steve's in love with who I am
Back in servers, I used to build a river dam
Now I hit the mineshafts with some torches in my hands
Smelt a couple sand, diamond on my armor stand
Heading out to the mine (To the mine)
To the mine (To the mine)
To the mine (To the mine)
To the mine (To the mine)

[Verse 4: Lil Cheek]
Yeah, shot the last guy off
Taking wins, ain't taking Ls
Natey said, "It was easy"
But I said, "We almost fell", yeah
I crashed, oh, shoot (Oh, shoot!), need to reboot (Reboot it!)
Leather armor to diamond suit (Lil Cheek)
We on SkyBlock, Natey jumping off, no parachute
Reptile on the track, she said she's taking all my loot (All the loot?)
Enchanted books, yeah, this how I look, yeah
'Bout to fish, yeah, just check the hooks, yeah
Stole this from your base, I'ma show you what I took
Lil Cheek can PVP, got all the noobies shook

[Intro]
I-I-Ivan the producer
(Turn your diamonds into stone)
(Yeah)

[Chorus]
I got blocks, I got ores, what you want?
Hop into the mineshaft, hop into my minecart
TNT about to blow oh woah like a ghast
They try to ban my player I ban them from Minecraft
Tame a doggie with bones
Couple creepers blowing up, now they invading my home
I got two twin swords, turn your diamonds into stone
I see two twin picks, grief your base when I'm alone
I got two ender pearls, teleport the gang home

[Verse]
I got tables, enchantment books, what you want?
The Looting, Bane of Anthropods, Knockback and Silk Touch
Steve know I got the block of diamonds, emeralds and such
I'm needing me a mutton but my health ain't going up
I started from the bottom, you can see me crafting doors
Now I stole all your loot and I got way more than before
The admins try to ban me 'cause I'm playing while they bored
But them admins don't know me, I'll beat them with my sword
I got lots of griefers tryna pull up to my place
But you don't wanna grief me when a sword is in your face
They talking in the chat but then it's different when we play
You steady playing Fortnite but it's Minecraft everyday

[Chorus]
I got blocks, I got ores, what you want?
Hop into the mineshaft, hop into my minecart
TNT about to blow oh woah like a ghast
They try to ban my player I ban them from Minecraft
Tame a doggie with bones
Couple creepers blowing up, now they invading my home
I got two twin swords, turn your diamonds into stone
I see two twin picks, grief your base when I'm alone
I got two ender pearls, teleport the gang home
I got blocks, I got ores, what you want?
Hop into the mineshaft, hop into my minecart
TNT about to blow oh woah like a ghast
They try to ban my player I ban them from Minecraft
Tame a doggie with bones
Couple creepers blowing up, now they invading my home
I got two twin swords, turn your diamonds into stone

[Intro: Galaxy Goats]
I don't want a lot from Minecraft
There is just one thing I need
I don't care about the emeralds
Lying in the deep ravines
I just want this in my mine
I'll even type a sign
Make my armor shine
All I want for Minecraft is lapis

[Verse 1: ReptileLegit]
I don't want a lot from Minecraft
There is just one thing I need (And I)
I don't care about the emeralds
Lying in the deep ravines
I don't even hang my armor
I just mine in the caves (And I)
I don't care about the temples
If I'm trapped, I'll leave the game

[Chorus 1: ReptileLegit]
I just want this in my mine
I'll even type a sign
Make my armor shine
All I want for Minecraft is lapis
Lapis, baby

[Verse 2: Galaxy Goats]
Oh, I won't ask for much on Minecraft
I won't even wish for gold
I'm just gonna keep on mining
Underneath my Minecraft home
I won't craft an eye of end and send it
To the Ender for the end dragon
I won't even stay awake to
Hear those zombies break my door

[Chorus 2: Galaxy Goats]
'Cause I just want you to enchant
Put you inside my e-chest
A fortune pick for you
Baby, all I want for Minecraft is lapis
Lapis, baby

[Bridge: Galaxy Goats]
Oh, all the torches are shining
So brightly in my cave
And the sounds of creepers
Hissing fills the air
And all the Steves are mining
I hear those pickaxe swinging
Notch, won't you bring me the ore I really need?
Won't you please bring my lapis to me?

[Verse 3: ReptileLegit]
Oh, I don't want a lot from Minecraft
This is what I'm mining for
I just wanna see this blue piece
I just want this single ore

[Chorus 1: ReptileLegit]
Cause I just want this in my mine
I'll even type a sign
Make my armor shine
All I want for Minecraft is lapis
Lapis, baby

[Outro: ReptileLegit]
All I want is, all I need is, lapis, baby
All I want is, all I need is, lapis, baby

[Chorus: Old Gray]
They're burying me with my dead dreams, my dead dreams
They’re burying me with my dead dreams
That still work

[Verse: ReptileLegit]
Hell, it's been a while and I knew you never felt the same
I know it's both of us, but for you I will take the blame
I know you’re broken, 'cause you're smoking tree like every day
I fell for you around these months, I hate the holidays
Every sad song I write's all about you
The fact that you led me on and played me, look what that drew
Drew another picture of a broken heart with broken songs
I get the urge to text you, but I know it will go wrong
Just say it to my face, you never loved me
Posting on your Story with your friends like you above me
We were always something, playin' like it's nothing
You don't know I feel this way, 'cause everyday I’m running
I try to play it off from the fact that you like my friends
I tried to brush it off that we will never talk again
I always reminisce about the last time we would spend
Even though it’s short, I never though it'd be our end

[Chorus: Old Gray & ReptileLegit]
They’re burying me with my dead dreams, my dead dreams (My dead dreams)
They're burying me with my dead dreams
That still work
(Even though it's short, I never thought It'd be our end)

[Chorus]
You're such a freakin' miner, I love it (I love it)
You're such a freakin' miner, I love it (I love it)

[Verse 1]
You're such a freakin' miner, I love it (Love it, love it)
And these creepers blow my ores, don't love it (Ores)
(Don't love it)
I just pulled up in a minecart (Cart)
With a chest that's full of diamonds (Diamonds)
And I got a couple swords
You can see that I ain't lyin' (Uh-uh)
And these trollers getting ignorant
Griefing, raiding, I'm so sick of it (Sick of it)
All these temples I be seein'
When I'm out on the beach fishin'
Inventory full of diamonds
Ooh, yuh, where's the mine? (Where?)
Me and Alex sippin' potions
Ooh, yuh, then we grind (Grind)

[Chorus]
You're such a freakin' miner, I love it (Whoop!)
You're such a freakin' miner, I love it (I love it)

[Interlude]
You're such a freakin' miner
When's the last time they asked you if you smelt the gold or steel?
Why you tryna come in my mineshaft with wooden items and leather armor?
You're such a freakin'...

Maxo

[Verse]
Lips so big, she could swallow down a pole
And she looking like a Wii remote that’s outta control
Girlie try to be so ghetto, but she never held a stick
I don’t like the way you look, but your granny hella thick
But she saying she a snack, but that body kinda wack
And she said got a booty, only thing I see is fat
If you wanna live with me, you just got to be a furry
Nah, I’m kidding little girl, BDSM's kinda scurry
I just hit a thot in the DMs
I don’t even know if she will see 'em
Sad nibba hours, coming like it’s semen
Be gone, thot, I don’t wanna hear you screaming
Girls on my Snap, hoeing round like they travelers
New mans every month, someone get this ho a calendar
She begging for a guy, someone get this thot a manager
Emotional mess, uh, who could even handle her?

[Outro]
All women are queens
If she breathes, she's a thot!
I hate thots
They’re all over my Snapchat
Always telling nibbas to shoot their shot
They’re desperate
I hate thots

[Intro]
Yeah

[Chorus]
Who am I? Someone that's afraid to give their sword, uh
You decide if I should go mining all these ores, yeah
Suicide, 'cause I just fell off a giant mountain, uh
The mobs, they kill me, the mobs, they kill me
Who am I? Someone that's afraid to give their sword, uh
You decide if I should go mining all these ores, yeah
Suicide, 'cause I just fell off a giant mountain, uh
The mobs, they kill me, the mobs, they kill me

[Verse]
I gave her everything
She took my diamonds away from me
My pick's been so broken lately
I won't fight, I'd rather mine
I'm lost in the mineshaft
But I can dig my way out
I love when I build
But the griefers destroy my house

[Chorus]
Who am I? Someone that's afraid to give their sword, uh
You decide if I should go mining all these ores, yeah
Suicide, 'cause I just fell off a giant mountain, uh
The mobs, they kill me, the mobs, they kill me
Who am I? Someone that's afraid to give their sword, uh
You decide if I should go mining all these ores, yeah
Suicide, 'cause I just fell off a giant mountain, uh
The mobs, they kill me, the mobs, they kill me

[Instrumental Bridge]

[Chorus]
Who am I? Someone that's afraid to give their sword, uh
You decide if I should go mining all these ores, yeah

You decide if I should go mining all these ores, yeah

Hunger Games victory, we stay winnin'
Stevie got me like...

[Pre-Chorus]
Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh

Diamond, hey!

[Chorus: ReptileLegit]
Oh‚ here we go‚ diamonds in the snow
Oh‚ you know, to the end, oh‚ here we go

[Verse 1: ReptileLegit]
If I took you to the Nether, you'll see blazemen that will shoot
If I took you to my sever, you'll kill me and take my loot
I got fortune on my pick and feather falling on my boots
If I fought you in Hunger Games then be prepared to lose
I don't mean to kill your sheep‚ now you're takin' all my crops
I'ma mine ores later on, minin' all these different blocks
I'ma craft ourselves a cake with couple cherries on the top
Fightin' zombies in the dark while we play "Cat" on the Jukebox

[Pre-Chorus: ReptileLegit]
I thought you would mine with me
You betrayed our PVP team
So what I'm gon' do?
I'ma mine these diamonds, make a diamond base without you

[Chorus: ReptileLegit]
Oh, here we go, diamonds in the snow
Oh, you know, to the end, oh, here we go

[Refrain: ReptileLegit]
If I took you to the Nether, you'll see blazemen that will shoot
If I took you to my sever, you'll kill me and take my loot
I got fortune on my pick and feather falling on my boots
If I fought you in Hunger Games then be prepared to lose

[Verse 2: Galaxy Goats]
Look! Arrow, arrow
Thought you heard about me, must not, must not
Last Creeper did me dirty, dirty
Like a griefer on a server, server
Now my armor is some diamonds, I'm hard like the block bedrock
Can't mine no iron ores, I can only mine them diamonds
That's a fact, dressed in black, my pick breaks, craft it back
I be chillin' watchin' PewDiePie, my favorite Minecrafter
Now, you know how I get, everyday minin' diamonds
Rather ban you off my server then see you with another Alex, uh

[Chorus: ReptileLegit]
Oh, here we go, diamonds in the snow
Oh, you know, to the end, oh, here we go

[Refrain: ReptileLegit]
If I took you to the Nether, you'll see blazemen that will shoot
If I took you to my sever, you'll kill me and take my loot
I got fortune on my pick and feather falling on my boots
If I fought you in Hunger Games then be prepared to lose

[Outro: ReptileLegit]
I thought you would mine with me
You betrayed our PVP team
So what I'm gon' do?
I'ma mine these diamonds, make a diamond base without you

[Intro]
Hey, what's the matter, honey?

[Chorus]
I don't sleep, 'cause when I do
All I dream are dreams of you
And in yours, you say your teeth are falling out
I don't sleep, 'cause when I do
All I dream are dreams of you
And in yours, you say your teeth are falling out

[Verse]
Nightmares, scary visions all up in his head
All nighters, passing out, feeling brain dead
Boy don't feel himself no more from the start
Girl be curving in his line, it's a round of Mario Kart
He hates the fact that she needs another bear
Every time he would hit her up, she act like he never there
Cold nights, sad hours in the morning
She would cry for a lover while she hears the rain pouring
Boy would give his time, boy would give his world
But the woman would decline, boy insisted for this only girl
Guy would give his hours, guy would give his joy
She ignored all his love and went straight for the bad boy
He can’t help himself, only went crazy
Questioning "Why all the women always play me?"
Crying on his bed, all his visions went to blur
Couldn’t fall asleep or dream without thinking of this only girl

[Chorus]
I don't sleep, 'cause when I do
All I dream are dreams of you
And in yours, you say your teeth are falling out
I don't sleep, 'cause when I do
All I dream are dreams of you
And in yours, you say your teeth are falling out

[Intro]
Abid on the beat

[Verse 1]
I've been moving houses so the mobs don't kill me
Tryna beat Survival ain't a struggle for me
Don't try to PvP me with your God Mode on me
Only keep it real so don't start some with me
Makin' ender portals ain't no mystery
Strike the Ender Dragon, get the victory
Hope I get some diamonds in the mineshaft
Got some friends to help me out in Minecraft

[Chorus]
Minecraft, Minecraft
I go minin', then I won't (Woo)
Get diamonds and then I don't (Ayy, don't)
I finessed on Hunger Games (Ayy, 'nessed)
I go down on the MC (Yuh, wait)
Mine some diamonds, punch a tree (Yuh, wait)
I make sure that my dogs eat

[Post-Chorus]
And still, creepers
There's a lot creepers
That be blowing, and blowing, and blowing, and blowing
And blowing my house
Creepers
There's a lot creepers
That be blowing, and blowing, and blowing, and blowing
And blowing my house
(Ayy, ayy)

[Verse 2]
She said, "Give me armor" I gave her only hardly
I only spend my diamonds on my sword, I'm sorry
50 gold, I even got some lapis on me
Make a cake and then I bring some to the party
And you know me
Make a strong house so creepers won't blow me
Without armor, I look like a phony
Herobrine be lookin' real foamy

[Outro]

[Verse]
Suddenly, you’re in love
And you look a little deeper into what you’re feeling
I think I feel it too much
It's like I’m breathing underwater, but I ain't sinking (Uh)
I think that you're a sweetie
It's just the love I have came too easy
It’s the way how we both grew
The connection made me fall for you, uh

[Chorus]
Suddenly, you're in love
You're in love, suddenly, you're in love
Suddenly you're in love, love
There is nothing I can do
Suddenly, you're in love

[Chorus]
Drip a little bit, I pick money over heartbreak
Rather count my blessings than the bodies that make heart ache
You try to put me down to the ground, see me falling
Now you wanna be with me when I'm up, saw you calling
Drip a little bit, I pick money over heartbreak
Rather count my blessings than the bodies that make heart ache
You try to put me down to the ground, see me falling
Now you wanna be with me when I’m up, saw you calling

[Verse 1]
Saw when you were down, I would try to pick you up
But you curved me and you ditched me and you left me there stuck
Now I found my way out, and you see that I'm in heaven
You tore me, now you see me doing well, you want my credit
You were like a player, I was Koopa in your game
You would try to beat me up, see me fall once again
And you did it, but I'm risen, now I’m making all my bank
And I'm granting all my wishes, all this money covers you, ayy

[Bridge]
All this money covers you, ayy
All this money covers feelings, ayy
All this money covers you, ayy
All this money covers feelings, ayy
All this money covers you, ayy (Drip a little bit)
All this money covers feelings, ayy (Drip a little bit)
All this money covers you, ayy (Drip a little bit)
(Drip a little bit, I pick money over heartbreak)

[Chorus]
Drip a little bit, I pick money over heartbreak
Rather count my blessings than the bodies that make heart ache
You try to put me down to the ground, see me falling
Now you wanna be with me when I'm up, saw you calling
Drip a little bit, I pick money over heartbreak
Rather count my blessings than the bodies that make heart ache
You try to put me down to the ground, see me falling
Now you wanna be with me when I'm up, saw you calling

[Verse 1: ReptileLegit]
This is the worst server I've ever played within my life
When we finally teleport to the End, you all die
I understand that if we're on Hardcore Mode, we are bad
When you join the game, I don't think we can stay alive

[Chorus 1: ReptileLegit]
You should've picked Stevie
You should've mined any kind of rare ore
We ended up dying, and we lost our stuff
You should learn how Minecraft works
You should've been shooting—

[Interruption: Ardelta]
If you like Stevie so much, why don't you just /marry him?

[Verse 2: Ardelta]
So you're the dude that only builds and never ever brews
You're the reason our server only has 2 players
I've never seen anybody get trolled as hard as you
Maybe you should go back to playing Roblox, oof

[Chorus 2: Ardelta & ReptileLegit]
I'm not gonna be Stevie
I don't have to mine any kind of rare ore
We ended up dying, then you rage quited
What did you kick me out for?
You should've picked Stevie
I'm not gonna mine any kind of rare ore
We ended up dying, and we lost our stuff
What did you kick me out for?

[Bridge: Ardelta & ReptileLegit]
Maybe I'll be creeper
I'm already creeper
What about iron golem?
I'm already iron golem
I'll be pigman
Nerf pigman
You're right. So, mooshroom
I wanna be mooshroom
I guess I'll be Alex
I'm already Alex
Then I'll be the witch
I already chose the witch
I have an idea
What's your idea?
You should be...
I'm not gonna be Stevie

[Chorus 3: Ardelta & ReptileLegit]
You should've picked Stevie
I don't have to mine any kind of rare ore
We ended up dying, and we lost our stuff
What did you kick me out for?
I'm not gonna be Stevie
You should've mined any kind of rare ore
We ended up dying, then you rage quited
You should learn how minecraft works

Look, the new Steve is really still the real Steve
I swear I got the skills, B, these zombies tryna hit me
Infecting the whole village, they never ever stoppin'
These creepers unpredictable, you don't know when they poppin'
And when the flesh is rotten, you eat it but you hurtin'
And when I get you emeralds, you spend it like you earned it
And when you popped off in arenas you've been workin'
I thought you were the one that would camp behind a person
Notch makin' money
I cook you porkchops but you love a bunny
Mobs dyin' cause it's sunny
I know your cheat codes 'cause you use too many

[Chorus]
Herobrine, do you love me? Are you mining?

Cause I want coal, and I need coal
For smeltin' iron

Cause I want coal, and I need coal
For smeltin' iron

[Interlude]
Two endermen that are comin' in your way
Comin'-comin' in your way, come-comin' in your way
You looked at both of them and they won't stay away
Won't stay away, won't-won't stay away

I won't mine right now—what's your sword-sword-sword worth?
Cause I want coal, and I need coal
For smelting iron

For smelting i—
S-s-s-smelting i—
S-s-s-smelting iron

To run away and leave me feeling this empty
Damn, Haven, you need to chill

[Chorus]
Gary, come home, I feel a little lonely
You promised me you would stay, but now you ain't my homie
Should have took it slowly, house no longer cozy
Yeah, I vibed with Rocky, but let’s keep it on the low-key

[Verse 1]
Oh jeez, didn't mean to offend you like that

And you said that it was round, now you moving out of town
Now I'm feeling some sad nibba hours, making this new sound, oh

[Chorus]
Gary, come home, I feel a little lonely
You promised me you would stay, but now you ain’t my homie
Should have took it slowly, house no longer cozy
Yeah, I vibed with Rocky, but let's keep it on the low-key

[Verse 2]
Gary, I'm sorry, played you like Atari
And now that you gone, it don't feel like a party
I miss your pink shell, fed you some kelp
Going insane, that I think I need help
Talking to Patrick, and he said you gone
He said you packed and you left in the morn'
You vented to pets, and you said that you done
Gary, come home I know you was my one
Uh, uh, man, who knew?
Bikini Bottom don't feel the same without only you
I should have kept it quiet and looked through your point of view
Gary, now that you gone, everything be feeling blue
Uh, uh, the memories we had
I didn't think that you would leave, and I'm forever sad
Gary, come home, didn’t think you was this bad
Baby Gary, please come home, please come here to your dad

[Chorus]
Gary, come home, I feel a little lonely
You promised me you would stay, but now you ain’t my homie
Should have took it slowly, house no longer cozy
Yeah, I vibed with Rocky, but let's keep it on the low-key

Slapping the beats, like your mom with a chancla

Bow down to me, 'cause I am your new father

[Verse 1]
Stop hitting up my phone like I'm famous
Stop hitting up my line, good gracious
I just wanna be my own person, minus hatred
Thinking I'm a loser, take a look at what you painted
You painting portraits of a winner, I'm sorry
Know you wanna see me fail, what you see is hardly
Asking me a lot of questions, name isn’t Safari
Greeting me with paragraphs, you faker than a Barbie, ugh

[Interlude]
Get it? 'Cause you sending me paragraphs, but you say stuff behind my back?
And Barbies are fake, so you're faker than a Barbie
No? Don't get it? Alright, whatever, anyways

[Verse 2]
See you salty in my DMs once again
See you posting ' bout your homies, but we know they ain’t your friends
Yeah, I know you think you’re cool, but take a look at where you landed
Why you try to get with girls you will never have a chance with? (Oof)
Not my problem, I’m just bumping music in my car
My own music on the aux, like i’m a superstar
Sleeping, and I'm dreaming, making wishes in the well
I hope my music will be great, but only time will tell

[Outro]
But only time will tell
But only time will tell
But only time will tell
I hope my music will be great but time will tell

[Chorus]
Minecart roads, take me home
To the cave, I will mine
West tundra, skyblock hills
Take me home, minecart roads

[Intro: Bobby "Blue" Bland]
When I was up
Come around
Needed a friend
Oh, you could never be found

[Chorus: Bobby "Blue" Bland]
When I was up
You would always come around
But when I needed a friend
Oh, you could never be found

[Verse 1: ReptileLegit]
You wanna stick with fake friends? Well, that's your life
You wanna hang with low lovers? Girl, that's your life
You wanna act like you got new friends? That's your life
You're acting for an audience, and you think that's right
To be honest, I can slowly see the two-faced
Everyday's a bigger picture, everyday's a new page
I'll be on my own pace, moving to a new place
Only trust your family, the people lifting up your weight
Fake friends, man everywhere, like roaches
I'm just tryna live my life and keep up with the ocean
I'm just filled with anger, they just wanna stall
I'm helping everyone around me, but I never get a call
And I'm pissed, but they don't understand
Whenever they are down, all I do is hold their hand
Whenever I feel down, all their messages are bland
Wanna isolate my figure, but I know that I'll feel damned, uh

[Chorus: Bobby "Blue" Bland]
When I was up
You would always come around
But when I needed a friend
Oh, you could never be found

[Verse 2: ReptileLegit]
Lately I've been feeling nothing but the distance
Hating everyone around me got me feeling different
Couldn't really vent, 'cause no one bothered to see
And the only person who could understand myself is me
And this made my mind blown, and I only feel alone
'Cause the only thing I'm feeling is the negative stones
From my friends, from my peers, hope that all of you hear that
You caused me to be Satan, and you're rising up your fears, huh
Damn, all of you are hella dumb
I feel like I'm the smart one hanging with some bums
I hate it that I say it, gave advice, but y'all don't take it
Y'all betray, it's like I'm wasting all my time instead of saving it
Damn, I hope that you guys get some help
'Cause all your negativity is changing up myself
And now I gotta will fix myself to be the past me
I hope that y'all will get your motivation and be free, huh

[Chorus: Bobby "Blue" Bland]
When I was up
You would always come around
But when I needed a friend
Oh, you could never be found

[Verso 1]
Enderdragon en mi direccion
Muchos xp, es una bendición, sí
Usa todos los XP para encantar mi armadura, si
Ohh ohh, sí ...
Quiero dormir en el noche
Pero las turbas están cerca
Tengo que matarlos asi que duermo (Duermo)
Me gusta esta armadura cómoda
Cambiarlo a pacífica en mi casa
Veo un pueblo que cerca, los únicos sonidos
Son los aldeanos cuando comercio
Fundir, fundir la plancha para el metal
Hace la piqueta para minar
Sabes que tengo minar diamantes
Oh si, ¡Sí!, Necesito comida en el viaje
Pudeo cocinar el cerdo o vaca?
Voy a hornear un pastel para mi harbre

[Coro]
Minecraftcito
Necesitas sobrevivir toda el dia
Haces una esapada para pelear
Haces una antorcha para la luz
Minecraftcito
Mátalo antes de que estalle mi casa
Pero explotó, necesito a salir
No tengo comida, estoy pescando
Mato la gente en juegos del Hambre
Trolling personas en juegos
Destrozar porque soy un griefer (Soy un griefer, soy un griefer, bebé)
Domando lobos con huesos por ayuda
Cuando las turbas matame
Mis perros atacarlos

[Verso 2]
Yo necesito armadura, bro
Piqueta y azada, bro
Espada pero no mostrar
No presumir los haters, bro
Hace edificios asi que to te mataran
Vete al infierno pero las turbas mataran
Obtener fuego polvo y hacer ojo de ender
Encontra el portal y pone ojos en marcos
Tomo tu espada y arco, si, no escodas
Eres un paso lejos completar Minecraft

[Pre-Coro]
Explorando explorando, a algunos biomas
Estamos en otro lugar, cambiando el tiempo
Veo una bruja, ocelote encima
Un arbol voy a alimentarlo
Explorando explorando, a algunos biomas
Estamos en otro lugar, cambiando el tiempo
Uso un bote para viajar
Esqueleto me ataca voy a hacer una casa

[Coro]

Minecraftcito

[Verse 1]
She a little broken
He a little hurt
Doing everything he can to help her from the dirt
She texts him when she's bored
He texts her ’cause he loves her
Just to find that the girl is texting many lovers
She playing with his head
And he just wants her back
But he knows everything they had will remain in the past
Moving on is hard, but for her it's easy
The only thing that'd get her back is if there was genie
He would wait for her to love him back if it’s all day
Everything she's doing entertains him in the wrong way
But what could he do?
His heart is stuck with hers
His friends tell him to see the red flags
All he sees are blurs

[Chorus 1]
Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah
All he sees are blurs
Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah
All he sees are blurs
Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah

[Verse 2]
It won't ever be the same, he refuses to accept it
Told her memories are faded but he still collects it
Told her pictures were deleted but his phone has kept it
Want to tell her everything but he knows he'll regret it
She doesn't feel good
She doesn't feel fine
Her mentality is breaking through the finish line
Everything around her is collapsing in a void
Everyday's another day of feeling broken, feeling paranoid
As for love
She'll never learn
The only thing she does with love is kill it with a burn
One day she will feel love but she won’t feel it for him
And one day she’ll feel the happiness that's kept within the brim
Nah, nah, nah, nah

[Chorus 2]
Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah
Kept within the brim
Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah
Kept within the brim
Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah

[Outro]
Yun Head, Obama loves you

[Intro]
Omae wa mou shindeiru

[Verse 1]
I be minin' all these diamonds
I be minin' lots of ores
Give me lots of sticks cause I’m crafting diamond swords
You only got leather and that’s kinda freakin' poor
And these creepers tryna blow up, I'ma craft an iron door
Uh, fightin' Drowners in the seas
Catch me in the temples, you can in ravines
You can catch me in the nether, catch me in the mineshaft
I'ma beat the Ender Dragon cause we playing Minecraft

[Chorus]
Yeah, we playing Minecraft
Hop on to my serve, we can mine it in the shaft
If you playing Fortnite, all of us are finna laugh
I'ma beat you in hunger games and you know that that’s a fact
Yeah, we playing Minecraft
Hop on to my serve, we can mine it in the shaft
If you playing Fortnite, all of us are finna laugh
I'ma beat you in hunger games and you know that that’s a fact

[Verse 2]
Playin' on survival, pull up with some diamond boots
Got the power five bow and my arrows finna shoot
If you aren’t talkin' diamonds, then I’m not takin' your loot
And my doggie killing zombies, honestly it’s kind of cute
I don’t play peaceful, only hardcore mode
“How you stunting with them diamonds?”
I don’t really freaking know
And I’m farming all this freaking wheat, I’m using diamond hoes
And you know I’m always suited up, my XP’s never low, oh no

[Intro]
Hey, uh, I just wanted to call and say that I'm always here if you need me, alright? Goodnight

[Verse]
Three o’clock at night, and I'm passed out at the back
Close my eyes for deep sleep, 'cause my mind is way too stacked
Brain is passed out for the day, but I’ll keep it back on track
Many errands for the week, that I can't do all the math
While I'm sitting on this seat, hearing you vent your mistakes
I will tell you things get better and your problems soon to break
I will say that you'll get over it and soon you'll find your happiness
Instead of being lonely, you will find out what laughing is
Right now, I'll just listen and hear you vent on the phone
Remind you that I'll be here and you'll never be alone
Just relax, all the problems you’re dealing are over soon
Take your mind out, drift away, take a trip out to the moon

[Intro: TryHardNinja]
Creeper
Aw man

[Verse 1: TryHardNinja]
So we back in the mine
Got our pickaxe swinging from side to side
Side-side to side
This task, a grueling one
Hope to find some diamonds tonight, night, night
Diamonds tonight

[Pre-Chorus: TryHardNinja]
Heads up
You hear a sound, turn around and look up
Total shock fills your body
Oh, no, it's you again
I can never forget those eyes, eyes, eyes
Eyes-eye-eyes

[Chorus: TryHardNinja]
'Cause, baby, tonight
The creeper's tryna steal all our stuff again
'Cause, baby, tonight
You grab your pick, shovel, and bolt again (Bolt again-gain)
And run, run until it's done, done
Until the sun comes up in the morn'
'Cause, baby, tonight
The creeper's tryna steal all our stuff again (Stuff again-gain)

[Verse 2: TryHardNinja]
Just when you think you're safe
Overhear some hissing from right behind
Right-right behind
That's a nice life you have
Shame it's gotta end at this time, time, time
Time-time-time-time

[Pre-Chorus: TryHardNinja]
Blows up
Then your health bar drops and you could use a one-up
Get inside, don't be tardy
So, now you're stuck in there
Half a heart is left, but don't die, die, die
Die-die-die

[Chorus: TryHardNinja]
'Cause, baby, tonight
The creeper's tryna steal all our stuff again
'Cause, baby, tonight
You grab your pick, shovel, and bolt again (Bolt again-gain)
And run, run until it's done, done
Until the sun comes up in the morn'
'Cause, baby, tonight
The creeper's tryna steal all our stuff again

[Verse 3: CaptainSparklez]
(Creepers, you're mine, haha)
Dig up diamonds and craft those diamonds
And make some armor, get it, baby
Go and forge that like you so MLG pro
The sword's made of diamonds, so come at me, bro, huh
Training in your room under the torchlight
Hone that form to get you ready for the big fight
Every single day and the whole night
Creeper's out prowlin', hoo, alright
Look at me, look at you
Take my revenge, that's what I'm gonna do
I'm a warrior, baby, what else is new?
And my blade's gonna tear through you, bring it

[Bridge: TryHardNinja & CaptainSparklez]
'Cause, baby, tonight
The creeper's tryna steal all our stuff again
(Gather your stuff, yeah, let's take back the world)
Yeah, baby, tonight (Haha)
Grab your sword, armor and go (It's on)
Take your revenge (Woo), oh-oh, oh-oh
So fight, fight, like it's the last, last night
Of your life, life, show them your bite (Woo)

[Chorus: TryHardNinja & CaptainSparklez]
'Cause, baby, tonight
The creeper's tryna steal all our stuff again
'Cause, baby, tonight
You grab your pick, shovel and bolt again (Bolt again-gain, woo)
And run, run until it's done, done
Until the sun comes up in the morn'
'Cause, baby, tonight (Come on, swing your sword up high)
The creeper's tryna steal all our stuff again (Come on, jab your sword down low)
(Woo)

[Verse 1]
I used to rule the world
Chunks would load when I gave the word
Now every night I go stow away
Hide from the mobs I used to slay
They once were terrified
Every time I looked into their eyes
Villagers would cheer my way
For a hero I was, that's what they'd say
One minute we had it all
Next our world began to fall
Away from all that it had once become
They all cried for my help, but I stood there numb

[Chorus]
I gaze off into the boundless skyline
Note block choirs playing in the sunshine
Turn around, pick up my sword and wield
The blade that once forced evil mobs to yield
And hope one day that this chaos and
Destruction turns for the better
Never a bow in hand
That was when I ruled the land

[Verse 2]
It was the creepers and the skeletons
Blew down the doors and boxed us in
Arrows whizzing by like streaks of light
I tried all that I could to stay and fight
As the undead roamed the street
Families broken at my feet
Life itself suspended by a thread
Oh, why was it that I wasn't dead?

[Chorus]
I gaze off into the boundless skyline
Note block choirs playing in the sunshine
Turn around, pick up my sword and wield
The blade that once forced evil mobs to yield
If this battle should leave me slain
I know Herobrine will call my name
Better to take a stand
That was when I ruled the land

[Instrumental Bridge]

[Chorus]
I gazed off into the boundless skyline
Note block choirs playing in the sunshine
Turn around, pick up my sword and wield
The blade that once forced evil mobs to yield
If this battle should leave me slain
I know Herobrine will call my name
Better to take a stand
And that was when I ruled the land

[Intro: TryHardNinja]
Digging Minecraft style
Minecraft style

[Verse 1: TryHardNinja]
Digging a hole, just one more time until I score this
Strike rich on diamonds, iron, gold
And build our decked-out fortress
All we need is just a bit of luck that we must not abort this
Running low, we can't afford this
Dungeons under here
Except last time a group of creepers came out over there
Blew up a vein of diamonds, then chased us all out of there
A spider army dropped down from the roof onto our hair
Ran back to fresh air

[Pre-Chorus 1: TryHardNinja]
This ain't your land, you're gonna get banned
So you know (Hey)
When you plan to go (Hey)
When you're digging, you better listen
So you know (Hey)
When they show (Hey)
Making sure you're all ready when you go

[Chorus: TryHardNinja]
Digging Minecraft style

Dig, dig, dig, dig, dig, digging Minecraft style

Dig, dig, dig, dig, dig, digging Minecraft style
Ay, sexy piggy
Dig, dig, dig, dig, dig, digging Minecraft style
Ay, sexy piggy!
Dig, dig, dig, dig, dig

[Verse 2: TryHardNinja]
Back on the ground, laying redstone through the forest
To wire our monster traps so all the zombies will ignore us
We built this city block-by-block and we don't welcome tourists
But they still come looking for us
Like a sauna here, we built a portal to the Nether
Lava everywhere, So tread with care, best you craft some armor
And exchange that for the clothes you wear
While you're under here

[Pre-Chorus 2: TryHardNinja]
Lava flowing, those lakes are glowing
Down below (Hey)
You should go (Hey)
But your ready, your arms are steady
Take the bow (Hey)
Shoot the fatal blow (Hey)
Run away now cause you missed, you were too slow

[horus: TryHardNinja]
Digging Minecraft style

Dig, dig, dig, dig, dig, digging Minecraft style

Ayyyyyyyyy, sexy piggy
Dig, dig, dig, dig, dig, digging Minecraft style

Dig, dig, dig, dig, dig

[Breakdown: TryHardNinja]
Dig some more until you hit the core
Diamonds diamonds baby that's what we're all looking for
Dig some more until you hit the core
When you find them then you know it's time to soar
Ain't a game we're playing

[Outro: TryHardNinja]
Ayyyyyyyy, sexy piggy
Dig, dig, dig, dig, dig, digging Minecraft style
Ayyyyyyyy, sexy piggy
Dig, dig, dig, dig, dig
Digging Minecraft style

[Chorus: TryHardNinja]
Don’t craft a diamond hoe, it’s useless (It's useless)
Don’t craft a diamond hoe, it’s useless (It's useless)

[Verse 1: TryHardNinja & CaptainSparklez]
Don’t craft a diamond hoe, it’s useless
(Craft a diamond hoe, whatcha doin'?)
The end without a bow, you clueless (Bow)
Got them phantoms raining down
You ain’t sleepin, yeah, they ruthless
While you suck we out here stuntin’
Use the wiki don’t know nothin’
And you diggin' down you ignorant
One by one, my god you ignant (Yeah)
In the water past your neck
You gonna drown while you out fishin’
Passing diamonds in the mine now
My god use your eyes (What are that?)
Skippin' potions for the Nether
No stop you gon' die (Die, die)

[Chorus: TryHardNinja & CaptainSparklez]
Don’t craft a diamond hoe, it’s useless, (Scoop!)
Don’t craft a diamond hoe, it’s useless

[Interlude: CaptainSparklez]
Don’t craft a diamond hoe
When the first time you tried to craft yourself a bow out here?
Why you tryna act like you didn’t mix up the sticks and the string first time round?
Don’t craft a diamond-

[Verse 2: CaptainSparklez]
Ain’t no bad luck, not it, you just suck (Whoop!)
Ain’t no bad luck, not it, you just suck (Whoop!)
Ain’t no bad luck, not it, you just suck (Whoop!)
Ain’t no bad luck, not it, you just suck (Whoop!)
Ain’t no bad luck, not it, you just suck
By lighting you struck, see now that’s some bad luck
You didn’t light up the town, now zombies runnin' amok
Ghast blew up your portal, no flint you slipped up
Ain’t no bad luck, you didn’t prep for it
You not making armor, your gear is unfit
You used the bonus kit, need someone to baby sit
Now get you some more seeds, that diamond hoe’s lit (Lit, lit, lit)

[Chorus: TryHardNinja]
Don’t craft a diamond hoe, it’s useless
Don’t craft a diamond hoe, it’s useless

[Verse 1]
What if I wrote this song about you
And it turned out that every word is true?
What if last night I had a vision
Where I saw you sitting silent in your room?
So, so sick and tired of feeling out of place
Got your headphones on with the boosted bass
You're not alone right now
Just hear my voice cut through the noise
When you play this song loud

[Chorus]
Turn it up, turn it up
Whenever you're fallin', hit play
Turn it up, turn it up
If you feel you're too far away
Turn it up, turn it up

[Verse 2]
We all want to feel connected
Like magnets that were pulled too far apart
What if the distance didn't matter
And our words could fix all lonely hearts?
Love in the harmony and you find a way
To broadcast to the world the melody that plays
You're not alone right now
Just hear my voice cut through the noise
When you play this song loud

[Chorus]
Turn it up, turn it up
Whenever you're fallin', hit play
Turn it up, turn it up
If you feel you're too far away
Turn it up, turn it up

{Bridge}
Turn it up
You can start right now, break the silence down
Turn it up
You are not alone when you play this loud

[Chorus]
Turn it up, turn it up
Whenever you're fallin', hit play
Turn it up, turn it up
If you feel you're too far away
Turn it up, turn it up

[Verse 1]
Lost but marching on like we've always known the trail
Searching for our ending to the fairy-tale
Sometimes even shooting stars find wishes that miss their marks
But when the night gets too dark
And the road home seems too far

[Chorus]
We'll see the sun come up again
We will climb higher than we've been
We got a fire that burns within
We are the dragon-hearted
We are the dragon-hearted
Courage to stop a cannonball
Together we stand 30 feet tall
We got a fire that burns within
We are the dragon-hearted
We are the dragon-hearted

[Post-Chorus]
We are the dragon-hearted

[Verse 2]
Fearless we soar, speeding arrows ricochet
Break free, our hearts burn brighter than yesterday
And through the battles we wage
When our shields fall away
The armor cracks and breaks
If ever our torches fade

[Chorus]
We'll see the sun come up again
We will climb higher than we've been
We got a fire that burns within
We are the dragon-hearted
We are the dragon-hearted
Courage to stop a cannonball
Together we stand 30 feet tall
We got a fire that burns within
We are the dragon-hearted
We are the dragon-hearted

[Post-Chorus]
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
We are the dragon-hearted

[Drop]
Standing tall, forever united
We are the dragon-hearted
We are the dragon-hearted
We are the dragon-hearted

[Outro]
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
We are the dragon-hearted

[Verse 1]
I came to dig
I'll build a city, oh so big
Just wait a sec, gotta kill this pig
Cook me some bacon, take a swig, swig, swig
Because there must be something I can craft
To help me ease the burden of this task

[Chorus]
I shoot my arrows in the sky, they fly
Singing "Oh, creeper's KO'd"
Loot his remains and now his sulfur's mine
Singing "Oh, not today, no"

[Post-Chorus 1]
Then I'll go to work under the birch tree
And I'll make myself tons of TNT
And I'll use these blocks to build a city
And I'll mine it all with TNT

[Verse 2]
I came to blow up everything you've ever known
Expel you out of house and home
Biome to biome you shall roam, roam, roam
Because I'm a creeper, I will rob
All of your precious items, that's my job

[Chorus]
I shoot my arrows in the sky, they fly
Singing "Oh, creepers KO'd"
T-Bag his ghost and now his sulfur's mine
Singing "Oh, not today, no"

[Post-Chorus 2]
Then I'll get back home
Where I'll smile with glee
Now that I can make
Tons of TNT
'Cause I rule my world
Made it 3 by 3
I'll blow it up
With TNT

[Bridge]
Gonna blow it all up
Every mountain, every valley
Ruler of the world, yup
All of the animals will fear me
'Cause TNT is just
TNT's just really cool
It's just really cool
It's just really cool

I shoot my arrows in the sky, they fly

[Chorus]
I shoot my arrows in the sky, they fly
Singing "Oh, creepers KO'd"
T-Bag his ghost and now his sulfur's mine
Singing "Oh, not today, no"

[Post-Chorus 2]
Then I'll get back home
Where I'll smile with glee
Now that I can make
Tons of TNT
'Cause I rule my world
Made it 3 by 3
I'll blow it up
With TNT

[Verse 1]
Closet full of secrets and skeletons awakes, but nothing's true
I used to own a castle, now it's boxes that I have to move
Right here in the darkness, there's nothing left for me to do
It's easier to run away, but today, today we got to

[Pre-Chorus]
Cast the shadows out from sight
A final stand, a shouting cry
All the wrongs now turned to right
So fight the past, take back the night

[Chorus]
And call upon a torch tonight
To bring out all the ghosts to light
Because at last we have to go
It's time to take back the night
To take back the night

[Verse 2]
Bridges burned and broken on different sides, we start anew
Being chased by monsters to face head-on or be consumed
Reaching out for something, grasping on to nothing to lose
Payback's left too long unpaid, but today, today we got to

[Pre-Chorus]
Cast the shadows out from sight
A final stand, a shouting cry
All the wrongs now turned to right
So fight the past, take back the night

[Chorus]
And call upon the torch tonight
To bring out all the ghosts to light
Because at last we have to go
It's time to take back the night

[Bridge]
Whoa, oh-oh-oh
Whoa, oh-oh-oh
Take back the night
Whoa, oh-oh-oh
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa

[Chorus]
And call upon the torch tonight
To bring out all the ghosts to light
Because at last we have to go
It's time to take back the night
To take back the night

[Bridge]
Whoa, oh-oh-oh
Whoa, oh-oh-oh
Take back the night
Whoa, oh-oh-oh
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
To take back the night
Whoa, oh-oh-oh
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
To take back the night
Whoa, oh-oh-oh
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
To take back the night
Whoa, oh-oh-oh

[Verse 1: TryHardNinja]
I came to dig, dig, dig, dig
I'll build a city, oh so big, big, big, big
Just wait a sec, gotta kill this pig, pig, pig, pig
Cook me some bacon, take a swig, swig, swig, swig, yeah, yeah
There must be something I can craft
To ease the burden of this task, yeah

[Chorus: TryHardNinja]
I shoot my arrows in the air sometimes
Sayin' "Ay-oh, creepers KO'd"
Loot his remains and now his sulfur's mine
Sayin' "Ay-oh, not today, no"

And then I'll go to work under the birch tree
And I'll make myself tons of TNT
And I'll use these blocks to build a big city
And I'll mine it all using TNT

Up everything you've ever known, known, known, known
Expel you out of house and home, home, home, home
Biome to biome you shall roam, roam, roam, roam, yeah, yeah
'Cause I'm a creeper, I will rob
All of your items, that's my job, yeah

Teabag his ghost and now his sulfur's mine
Sayin' "Ay-oh, MLG pro"

[Post-Chorus: TryHardNinja]
And then I'll head back home
Where I'll smile with glee
Now that I can make
Tons of TNT
'Cause I rule my world
Made it three by three
I'ma blow stuff up

[Bridge: TryHardNinja]
I'm gonna blow it all up
Every mountain, every valley
Ruler of the world, yup
All of the animals will fear me
'Cause TNT is awesome
And TNT is just really cool
It's just really cool
I'm gonna shoot my arrows in the air, arrows in the air
Shoot your arrows in the air

[Chorus: TryHardNinja]
I shoot my arrows in the air sometimes

[Spoken Intro]

[Verse 1]
Welcome to your office settle down and take a seat!
Please pay no attention to the terrifying screams
You should heed the warnings of the voice that's on the phone!
Tonight, you might be by yourself, but you are not alone!

[Chorus]
The masks that we wear
Pretend they aren't there
But you can only hide for so long, For so long (For so long , For so long ,For so long )


Why don't you-


Spend the night, then you'll find
There's evil that waits inside
Spend the night, then you'll find
There's evil that waits inside
Spend the night, then you'll find
There's evil that waits inside
Spend the night, then you'll find
There's evil that waits inside
IT'S ME
There's evil that waits inside-
IT'S ME

[Verse 2]
Though we tried our best you seem to have beginners luck
We came so close but we just couldn't make you one of us
Congratulations are deserved it's 6 AM, you win!
We'll see you here tomorrow night and do it all again!

[Chorus]
The masks that we wear
Pretend they aren't there
But you can only hide for so long, For so long (For so long , For so long ,For so long )
Why don't you-
Spend the night, then you'll find
There's evil that waits inside
Spend the night, then you'll find
There's evil that waits inside
Spend the night, then you'll find
There's evil that waits inside
Spend the night, then you'll find
There's evil that waits inside
IT'S ME
There's evil that waits inside-
IT'S ME

[Verse 1]
Hush now, drift off to sleep
Reality, a memory
Don't be scared of what you find
Yeah, it's all just in your mind
Monsters that live inside
Your head at night, they are all right
Cause they can never compare
To the ones that live outside

[Chorus]
So dream, dream, dream your dream
Cause when you're awake, a nightmare awaits
So dream, dream, dream your dream
Cause when you're awake, a nightmare awaits
It's a fantasy, they'll be seeing you soon
Nowhere left to go, terrors keep breaking through
So dream, dream, dream your dream
Cause when you're awake, the nightmare will become the truth

[Verse 2]
Rows of teeth penetrate
There's no escape, the veil is raised
Every mistake visible
So was it me after all?
A music box that creaks
The melody brings solemn peace
But only for one more breath
The last one you might have left

[Chorus]
So dream, dream, dream your dream
Cause when you're awake, a nightmare awaits
So dream, dream, dream your dream
Cause when you're awake, a nightmare awaits
It's a fantasy, they'll be seeing you soon
Nowhere left to go, terrors keep breaking through
So dream, dream, dream your dream
Cause when you're awake, the nightmare will become the truth

[Bridge]
The ticking clock breaks the spell with every beat
Illusion or not, you are safe for now, so dream
So dream your dream
So dream your dream

[Chorus]
So dream, dream, dream your dream
Cause when you're awake, a nightmare awaits
So dream, dream, dream your dream
Cause when you're awake, a nightmare awaits
It's a fantasy, they'll be seeing you soon
Nowhere left to go, terrors keep breaking through
So dream, dream, dream your dream
Cause when you're awake, the nightmare will become the truth

[Verse 1]
The city, it runs cold today
Sunshine, it is shining grey
And I wish I could, dig straight down
Black it all away
But in the dark, there's still a sound
And nothing changed

[Chorus]
Don't know if I have ever heard you sing, but I hear it
Don't know if I have ever held your hand, but I seek it
Don't know if I have ever loved, but I feel it
Put the puzzle back together, see what I'm dreaming
When I find the pieces

Don't know if I have ever loved, but I feel it
Put the puzzle back together, see what I'm dreaming
When I find the pieces

[Verse 2]
Faces echo with no names
Strangers feel like home, but fade
And I wish I could, dig straight down
Black it all away
But in the, dark there's still a sound
And nothing changed

[Chorus]
Don't know if I have ever heard you sing, but I hear it
(hear it, hear it, hear it, heart it)
Don't know if I have ever held your hand, but I seek it
(seek it, seek it, seek it, seek it)
Don't know if I have ever loved, but I feel it
Put the puzzle back together, see what I'm dreaming

Put the puzzle back together, see what I'm dreaming
When I find the pieces
When I find the pieces
When I find the pieces

Don't know if I have ever loved, but I feel it
(When I find the pieces)
Put the puzzle back together, see what im dreaming
When I find the pieces
When I find the pieces
When I find the pieces
When I find the pieces
When I find the pieces

[Intro: TryHardNinja]
Alright
Let me see your pick axes in the air
And sing this one with me

[Hook]
I came to dig

[Verse 1: TryHardNinja]
We diggin' all the time and you know we won't stop
We getting' diamonds man
Yea you know them big rocks
You playing peaceful while I'm the school of hard knocks
Grew fighting every day
Call that Survival Block
Creepers trying' to do me dirty they won't sssmirk long
Just ask CaptainSparklez about that forged diamond sword
Just ask the Nanner man, Shwarzenegger Arnold, there's no point in running man
What you think this arrows for?
Sky's the limit we be building' this is our home
Another day, another structure, world that we own
There's no griefin' here cause you see that gravel road?
I'll leave it painted with your blood. Red stone
And I'll be building whole cities. What do you know?
You still stuck playing with your daddies legos
I'm getting' busy Diggy Diggy like Blue Xephos
A step ahead, another class, always a Notch above
You make a shack to live in
I make the Taj Mahal
You choppin' down a tree
I made a Pokeball
You are soft break apart like a clay block
I'm solid like a golden ore
I got this game on lock

[Hook]
I came to dig

[Post-Hook]
If you're crafting and you know it put your hands in the air
Wanna see you swing that pick axe like you don't really care
Came to dig, do it big
Block Billionaire
If you're crafting and you know it put your hands in the air

[Verse 2: CaptainSparklez]
Oh no this again
Gotta take a sec kill a pig again
Dealing with a creeper and he's hiss-hissin'
And I'm gonna get revenge like a tune I'm in
We're a father son relationship
I'm the block and you're just the chip
And these boxes are my currency
So I'm always stacking mine like Pringle chips
From the sea and to the desert this is my reality
From the caves until the nether it's my world to oversee
This might seem like something special but we do this everyday
This is my land, made with my hands
This is Minecraft and

[Hook]
I came to dig

[Verse 1: Jordan LaCore]
Down the rabbit hole, we saw you come in
Through the glass of our cages chained up where we live
Where we live
Please don't be afraid, we're a little bent
Broken souls looking for a way to start again
Start again

[Chorus: Jordan LaCore]
How can we ever be free
When our prison is skin-deep?
Left to rust, underneath
Buried us down below so no one sees
Daddy's little monsters

[Verse 2: Jordan LaCore]
Listen to voice keeping you alive
You need us, we need you, it'll be alright
Yeah, it's alright
We don't want to stay under lock and key
You can help break the curse, we all wanna leave
Wanna leave

[Chorus: Jordan LaCore]
How can we ever be free
When our prison is skin-deep?
Left to rust, underneath
Buried us down below so no one sees
Daddy's little monsters

[Bridge: Jordan LaCore]
If we could only shed our shells
Wear a mask and escape these cells
On the surface, we could start new
We could go if we looked like you
It's time for us to make the switch
It only stings for a little bit
You will stay and we get to leave
Thanks to you, now everyone will see

[Chorus: Jordan LaCore]
Daddy's little monsters
Daddy's little monsters
Daddy's little monsters
Daddy's little monsters
Daddy's little monsters

[Verse 1: TryHardNinja]
If you don't mind, we would like to take a moment
To invite you to an ongoing performance
In a hall of tragedies to watch the circus of the dead
(Dead, dead, dead)
Feel the spotlight fading, we can't do this alone
Need an audience so we can play out our roles
Got a front-row seat that's so close
It's like you're part of the show
(Show, show, show)

[Pre-Chorus: Jordan LaCore]
There's a place in the dark horror stories go to hide
Buried deep underground, pain and torment mechanized
Whoa, on a lit-up stage
Whoa, terror's on display
There's a place in the dark horror stories go to hide
Buried deep underground, pain and torment mechanized
Whoa, on a lit up stage
Terror's on display

[Chorus: TryHardNinja]
The show must go on
Hit the lights, we're going 'til there's no pulse left
This masquerade of souls
Needs a victim, won't you be our hopeless guest?
But if it helps, you can pretend
It's make-believe inside your head
This nightmare's as real as it gets
In the circus of the, in the circus of the
In the circus of the dead

[Verse 2: TryHardNinja]
Good, you got here just in time, you better hurry
It's our show but you're the star destined for glory
Here performing death-defying acts that we can't wait to see
(See, see, see)
Body count high as the tight rope, will you make it?
Zero safety nets, the tension is electric
Tonight, you're the one that jumps through hoops
We're going off the script
(Script, script, script)

[Pre-Chorus: Jordan LaCore]
There's a place in the dark horror stories go to hide
Buried deep underground, pain and torment mechanized
Whoa, on a lit up stage
Whoa, terror's on display
There's a place in the dark horror stories go to hide
Buried deep underground, pain and torment mechanized
Whoa, on a lit up stage
Terror's on display

[Chorus: TryHardNinja]
The show must go on
Hit the lights, we're going 'til there's no pulse left
This masquerade of souls
Needs a victim, won't you be our hopeless guest?
But if it helps, you can pretend
It's make-believe inside your head
This nightmare's as real as it gets
In the circus of the, in the circus of the
In the circus of the dead

[Bridge: TryHardNinja, Jordan LaCore]
It's where fear comes to life
No, you never stood a chance
As you gasp for breath
Here on the stage
You can run, you can hide
Feel the cold steel on your hands
Crawling to your death
There's no escape
It's a spectacle that drags down you six feet below
So, you should have stayed and just enjoyed some time at home
Encore! Now, the ringmaster comes for you
It's the grand finale, it'll all be over soon
(Over soon, over soon)

[Outro: TryHardNinja]
In the circus of the, in the circus of the
In the circus of
In the circus of the, in the circus of the
In the circus of the dead
It's make-believe inside your head
This nightmare's as real as it gets
In the circus of the, in the circus of the
In the circus of the dead

[verse 1]
It seems like
A lifetime ago
That I saw the gold
Sunshine glow
No, it doesn't reach
Down below

Shadows become the light
Here where the monsters hide

[preChorus]
Normal is just a dream
For all the ghosts like me

[Chorus]
I hate my metal bones
My bones and gears creak in my chest
My chest forever cold
A cold and maddening descent
Descending down so far
Fall farther 'til there's nothing left
I'm left here in the dark
The dark
I dance to forget

[verse 2]
This is my penitentiary
Fractured apart from the world
Where I want to be
Lock the door
Throw away the key

And let my dance resume
Down in a pitch black room

[preChorus]
Normal is just a dream
For all the ghosts like me
(like me)

[Chorus]
I hate my metal bones
My bones and gears creak in my chest
My chest forever cold
A cold and maddening descent
Descending down so far
Fall farther 'til there's nothing left
I'm left here in the dark
The dark
I dance to forget
I dance to forget

[verse 3]
Come now
Dance with me
As the song plays
Down down
Dance with me
Stuck on replay

Come now
Dance with me
As the song plays
Down down
Dance with me
Stuck on replay

[Chorus]
I hate my metal bones
My bones and gears creak in my chest
My chest forever cold
A cold and maddening descent
Descending down so far
Fall farther 'til there's nothing left
I'm left here in the dark
The dark
I dance to forget
I dance, I dance, I dance
I dance to forget
I dance, I dance
I dance to forget

He's been waiting, abandoned and patient, so long (long)
A savage masked ghost story from the past he roams (roams)

He said follow me
Follow follow follow

Over 30 years ago, when he took them down below, and tonight he walks again so step inside enjoy the show

Follow me
Then you'll see
Follow follow follow follow, but the truth is hard to swallow
Follow me
Then you'll see
Follow follow follow follow
Follow me, see a nightmare in action

Deeds so rotten came back to haunt him they know
Forever changed, he wears his spring locked grave alone (alone)

He said follow me
Follow follow follow

All the horrors have been sealed, boarded up they were concealed
But its time for the real monster's face to finally be revealed

Follow me
Then you'll see
Follow follow follow follow, but the truth is hard to swallow
Follow me
Then you'll see
Follow follow follow follow
Follow me, see a nightmare in action

[Verse 1]
There is a legend
A legend born long ago
About a wicked
A wicked man no one knows
Went and unraveled
Six innocent little souls

The souls found bodies
The bodies started to move
Some say they still walk
Walk the halls staying from view
I got a secret
That I am here to tell you
That place is this very place
And all the stories are true

[Chorus]
The world's a scary place
We're not monsters just changed
Bigger hands for grabbing a hold
We were lost to foul play
But we got an upgrade
Lots more teeth for eating you whole
Here comes another chapter
Your heart is beating faster
Cause you're the one we're after

Five nights at Freddy's 4
Thank you for bringing us home

[Verse 2]
We were just like you
Like you just playing a game
That's when the wicked
Wicked man led us astray
Without a warning
Our lives have been rearranged

As for our story
The story's not over yet
There's still one secret
One secret left to be said
Tonight when you are
Safely tucked into your bed
Close all the doors that you want
We're already in your head

[Chorus]
The world's a scary place
We're not monsters just changed
Bigger hands for grabbing a hold
We were lost to foul play
But we got an upgrade
Lots more teeth for eating you whole
Here comes another chapter
Your heart is beating faster
Cause you're the one we're after

Five nights at Freddy's 4
Thank you for bringing us home
Thank you for bringing us home

Here comes another chapter
Your heart is beating faster
Cause you're the one we're after

Five nights at Freddy's 4
Thank you for bringing us home
Thank you for bringing us home
Thank you for bringing us home
Thank you for bringing us home

[Verse 1]
Welcomed you underground with open arms
You knew how fragile their souls were to your abuse
I let you roam around care free
They're not your enemies

All this time determination served as your lone guide
Mercy or genocide, yours to decide
But consequences they increase
You will answer to me

[Pre-Chorus]
I exist outside it
Even if restarted your actions won't erase
Nothing safe from my eyes
You might but numbers don't lie
I can see your real face
So tell me

[Chorus]
Is there love, is there love, is there love in your heart?
Or kindness in your eyes?
Execute, execute, execute if you want retribution for your crimes
Were you honest with yourself?
'Cause I'll know
When I take a look inside
Is there love, is there love, is there love in your heart?
Then judgement will be mine

[Verse 2]
Might be fun
But your brutality can't be undone
And you know you don't want to get dunked on
So contemplate your cruelty
Only killers play dirty

Spare their lives
Consider twice before being unkind
Or you will end up having a bad time
No puns to make because it's true
The joke will be on you

[Pre-Chorus]
I exist outside it
Even if restarted your actions won't erase
Nothing safe from my eyes
You might but numbers don't lie
I can see your real face
So tell me

[Chorus]
Is there love, is there love, is there love in your heart?
Or kindness in your eyes?
Execute, execute, execute if you want retribution for your crimes
Were you honest with yourself?
'Cause I'll know
When I take a look inside
Is there love, is there love, is there love in your heart?
Then judgement will be mine

[Outro]
So, I've got a question for ya
Do you think even the worst person can change?
That everyone can be a good person if they just try?

[Intro]
(I love you)

[Verse 1]
You got my mind over-loaded
Thoughts of you fill my head
No room for nothing else
Hacked my love and you stole it
Reprogrammed all my rules
And guessed my password too

[Pre-Chorus 1]
And now, I can't feel the same
Your love is a bug I can't shake
You're pushing my hard drive too far
All the circuits might break

[Chorus]
'Cause love is a dangerous game
Love is a dangerous game
Why do we play it? (Why do we play it?)
Love is a dangerous game
Nothing can protect my brain
From a lovely virus like you
Get out of my head, get out of my head
Get out of my head, get out of my head

[Verse 2]
You're too much of a good thing
So good it's bad for me, corrupt my memory
Shocked my mainframe and it stings
In my mind, whole lines of code
Are glitched up and going rogue

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Sorry for acting a little bit strange
But now, I must have you, whatever it takes
You're pushing my hard drive too far
All the circuits might break

[Chorus]
'Cause love is a dangerous game
Love is a dangerous game
Why do we play it? (Why do we play it?)
Love is a dangerous game
Nothing can protect my brain
From a lovely virus like you
Get out of my head, get out of my head
Get out of my head, get out of my head

[Bridge]
If I can't have you then no one, no one, no one else can either
See her around you, I wanna, wanna, wanna just delete her
Sorry for acting a little bit strange
But now, I must have you, whatever it takes
If I can't have you then no one, no one, no one else can either
(I love you)

[Chorus]
'Cause love is a dangerous game
Love is a dangerous game
Why do we play it? (Why do we play it?)
Love is a dangerous game
Nothing could protect my brain
From a lovely virus like you
Get out of my head! Get out of my head!
Get out of my head! Get out of my head!

[Verse 1: TryHardNinja]
Through the static on the TV
You watched in horror as we were moving
And we want to thank you, for playing our game
We enjoyed your screams
Thank you for playing our game
The nightmares have been real
Though you seem quite terrified
We hope you enjoyed the ride
Thank you for playing our game
And all the tear-filled nights

[Chorus: DAGames & TryHardNinja]
Now, this is goodbye!
Now, this is goodbye!
Now, this is goodbye!
Now, this is goodbye!
Now, this is...

[Break]

[Verse 2: TryHardNinja]
It's been so long since we had fun
And shared the secrets of what we've become
And we want to thank you for playing our game
And answering the phone
Thank you for playing our game
You were not alone
Wish we could apologize
But we liked breaking your mind
Thank you for playing our game
And all the tear-filled nights

[Chorus: DAGames & TryHardNinja]
Now, this is goodbye!
Now, this is goodbye!
Now, this is goodbye!
Now, this is goodbye!
Now, this is...

[Break]

[Bridge: DAGames, TryHardNinja]
So, you say your not afraid
But contortions in your face
They keep giving you away
Take a good look!
There is terror in the mask
Getting closer to your desk
We're behind you on the bed
We'll see you soon!
Have you figured out it's me
With your theory?
As the darkness smothers the light!
So you managed to survive?
All that means is:
You live to die another day!
Now this is goodbye!

[Intro]
Howdy!
How's it goin'?
I'm Flowey
You seem nice

[Verse 1]
Thats quite a fall that you just took, I hope that you're alright
You must have heard some stories, but down here ain't so bad
'Cause no place could be that scary when its got such cute plants

[Pre-Chorus 1]
You see, I know that you have a nice soul
So I feel like its my responsibility to teach you how things work down here
Here we go!

[Chorus]
The underground is so much fun cause love is never far
Just float and catch the bright friendliness pellets with your heart
F-L-O-W-E-Y is with you 'till the end
'Cause golly, I am Flowey, and I'm your new best friend

[Verse 2]
Things you are afraid of, they won't bother you here
You're new so you must be confused, but all you'll find is cheer
Since we are so close now, I'll tell you what I know
Your soul wants love, its just like a flower that needs water to grow

[Pre-Chorus 2]
You see, I know that you have a nice soul
And because we're now besties, I feel like I should show you the ropes
Here we go!

[Chorus]
The underground is so much fun, cause love is never far
Just float and catch the bright friendliness pellets with your heart
F-L-O-W-E-Y is with you 'till the end
'Cause golly, I am Flowey, and I'm your new best friend

[Verse 3]
YOU IDIOT, ITS KILL OR BE KILLED
I WILL NOT REST 'TILL YOUR SOUL IS MINE
I WILL BE KING, NO, I'LL BE A GOD
NO ONE TO SAVE YOU, SO DIE
SO DIE!

[Outro]
Oh gosh...
That was certainly unexpected
Still BFFs though, right?
See you later!

[Intro: TryHardNinja]
I'm back
Still get rocks
And all this here mine
So get off my block

[Verse 1: TryHardNinja]
Still turning pigs into pork chops
Think of crossing me? Don't
Still pilin' gems into mountains, I like my currency tall
Think I'll construct me a castle, big ol' diamond filled moat
The only time you see diamonds is tryin' creative mode, heh
Griefin', don't tolerate
End a man if they hate
Still spill griefer blood
Redstone on the way
Don't be jealous cause its way too late
I got your girl in my server, she givin' me cake, cake, cake, cake, cake, cake, cake, cake
So much ice, I'll craft some skates
Mansions here and mansions there
Yeah I'm talkin' real estate, yeah I'm talkin' interstate
Minecart roads, acre lots
Keep your mortgage cause I built the town

[Hook: TryHardNinja and (CaptainSparklez)]
Get off my block
(H-h-h-here's a one way trip ticket for one)
Get off my block
Chest stuck on overstock like everyday
Get off my block
(H-h-h-here's a one way trip ticket for one)
Get off my block
Chest stuck on overstock like everyday
Get off my block

[Verse 2: CaptainSparklez]
Hey there, it's Mr. send-them-to-the-nether
Minecraft style right here
Heh heh heh get it?
Minecraft style, that means I'll make them disappear
This diamond sword will teleport, there's no need for obsidian
Here's a one way trip ticket for one, I hear it's nice this time of year
MLG pro creepers don't want this
Bring that glowstone flow, sparkle polish mix
Notch on the phone with the new update list
My treasure stacked so high
He might just add a G6 to boost me up to count it up cause its a long way to the top
It's soaring past the house and clouds and yeah, you can call that sky block
So come on up and join me
Try to craft a chest that's big enough
Or maybe craft a parachute
No space for you

[Hook: TryHardNinja and (CaptainSparklez)]
Get off my block
(H-h-h-here's a one way trip ticket for one)
Get off my block
Chest stuck on overstock like everyday
Get off my block
(H-h-h-here's a one way trip ticket for one)
Get off my block
Chest stuck on overstock like everyday
Get off my block

[Verse 3: TryHardNinja]
Knock, knock, bedrock when I come through
Stay survivin' much harder than they used to
Get off my block
Or your friends will need some tissue cause they might cry
But these arrows, they won't miss you
I got that big slime treasure, that means fully grown (Jerry? oh my!)
It's like I'm king chef of the kitchen cookin' bread at home
And you can go ask Sky, I got that butter throne
While you got the whole server like "You even dig bro?" (I dig!)
A self-made block billionaire, just check the map
I'm minin' while you watchin' like "What texture pack is that?"
I came to dig, dig, dig
Like I don't know to stop
Cause if it shine it's goin' be mine, work overtime

[Hook: TryHardNinja and (CaptainSparklez)]
Get off my block
(H-h-h-here's a one way trip ticket for one)
Get off my block
Chest stuck on overstock like everyday
Get off my block
(H-h-h-here's a one way trip ticket for one)
Get off my block
Chest stuck on overstock like everyday
Get off my block

[Outro: TryHardNinja]
Cube casino
Minerals and rocks
Rack 'em, stack 'em, poker chip 'em up
Jewels like lava overflowin' from the top
Chest stuck on overstock like everyday
Get off my block
Get off my block
Get off my block

[Note from Smike]

I knew you couldn't stay away
Forgotten for so long
I am the hunter, you're the prey
The white eyes at your door

It's not a game, it's a dangerous thing
Waking up ancient history
A nightmare we're both forced to repeat...
(I've been waiting for you)

They left you in charge but in here I call the shots
Tonight you're staying with a monster in the dark
So go check your screens
Play sounds or scream
You're just an attraction
In my amusement park...

Search through the static for my face
Power's out so reboot!
Hallucinations slowly fade
The clock won't save you

It's not a game it's a dangerous thing
Waking up ancient history
A nightmare we're both forced to repeat...

Dressed like a guard better reconsider
If you're the hired gun then I'm the trigger

They left you in charge but in here I call the shots
Tonight you're staying with a monster in the dark
So go check your screens
Play sounds or scream
You're just an attraction in my amusement park

I knew you couldn't stay away
I am the hunter you're the prey

They left you in charge but in here I call the shots
Tonight you're staying with a monster in the dark
So go check your screens
Play sounds or scream
You're just an attraction in my amusement park

[Verse 1]
Taken way too soon, I'm not at all what used to be
Shifting in a box, the past is nothing more than just a dream
Now I hear the call of evil growing once again.
I'm powerless to change your fates
But in the end I'll shelter you my friends

[Pre-Chorus]
Tonight we roam, and if they listen really close
They can hear us sing our song
(La la la la)

[Chorus]
And I can't give you back the things you had.
But you don't have to do this on your own
Even if you're never coming home
You're not alone
You're not alone

[Verse 2]
In our own little world, forever lost to passing time
No one knows what it's like to wear a mask that you are trapped inside
One day the purple clouds that hover over us will fade
Then we'll be free to cut the strings
To wipe the tears, but now
We walk in chains

[Pre-Chorus]
Tonight we roam, and if they listen really close
They can hear us sing our song
(La la la la)

[Chorus]
And I can't give you back the things you had.
But you don't have to do this on your own
Even if you're never coming home
You're not alone
You're not alone

[Verse 1]
Come down visit the circus
Take a break from the surface
In our twisted factory
You are the spare part we need

Gears grind spring locks are unwound
Bloody belt spinning 'round 'round
You don't know what we've been through
Awful fate we didn't choose

[Chorus]
It's a blueprint for fear a dream left rotting
There's a little of me in every body
(Ohwoahwoah!)
There's nowhere left to hide
The assembly line
Keeps on churning until we are one
Nightmare by design

[Verse 2]
Left here to rot in our cells
We reinvented ourselves
But before we can escape
Our mask could use an upgrade

Our souls prisoned and fractured
Fuse now dread manufactured
Don't hold it against us, please
When you're part of the machine

[Chorus]
It's a blueprint for fear a dream left rotting
There's a little of me in every body
(Ohwoahwoah!)
There's nowhere left to hide
The assembly line
Keeps on churning until we are one
NIGHTMARE BY DESIGN!

[Outro]
When you're part of the machine

[Hook]
You underestimated
And now the win in fading
I'm handing out defeat
Dead lobby like it's contagious
When it comes to C.O.D
There's no easy way to say it
Come one, come all, deadly free-for-all
My gun doesn't play any favourites
Doesn't play any favourites
No easy way to say it
Come one, come all, deadly free-for-all
My gun doesn't play any favourites
Doesn't play any favourites
No easy way to say it
Come one, come all, deadly free-for-all

All these rounds trapped in a chamber, but what is life behind bars?
So saftey's off, set 'em free, but they won't get very far
The enemies catch 'em all, you can call that Pokémon
And I stay lighting up that lobby like i'm that Charizard
Cause without a doubt I'm the first draft pick
You be on the wrong one
I'm a star, you make sure that the bench is a warm one
Meet me in S&D complain it was a short on?
Maybe you should try to get game time in game types with respawn
On second thought, forget it, man that's not gonna help
Cause you're a freshman, while I'm Valedictorian-esque
Because that's me in the chopper destroying everyone else
Keep killing you as you respawn that means you're fresh to death
But better run, you'll get chewed up because I'm armed to the teeth
Got an army of shooters I run [?] with a beast
Don't have to take that s truth, don't have to forfeit on me
Just don't get mad when you grab that bag and [?]
I make opponents look foolish, so press "Record" and don't stop
Enemies must be getting DDoSed because they scream "HACKER" a lot
Cause it's easy mode, all the others look like recruit Black-Ops bots
While most of you game footage got that word "Killcam" on the top
Just stop

[Hook]

[Verse 2, JiveTurkey600]
Uh, it's JiveTurkey600, rewind that
The Messiah, LeBron James of COD rap
THe Mike Jordan, the Black-Ops Crib
Got a port like Ray
The black top when I play
I gotta win this, plus I got Fast Hands
Move like Lightweight
Get Ghost and hack clans
Plus I'm running with and SMG
That describes me as a rapper, MSMC
I'm and MC and I'm a mess
They took Marathon Pro so I'm running less
Better get a vest
If you want to go to war with Jive and 'em
Them dude's a beast, man
2 on 5 and up!
If you sleep, you spot will get filled
Y'all dudes need lag comp to get kills
But it ain't helping no one up in this game
No perk, Cold Blooded, runs up in these veins

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
I make every lobby feel apocalypic every day
I'm on top of every lobby dropping bodies every day
Dropping every monster roster and look at what it did to FaZe
If you want to rip my lobby [?]
And when I witness little campers camping at the back of maps
My instinctual reaction to this is throw my shoulders back
Never sitting back, camping, I'mma rushing and attacking 'em
I'm an alpha male, with a harder hit than adamantium
Inception, Matrix, 300 all in one
I'm running with a pack of legends onto everyone
Destroying every challenger, screamng "1 on 1"
I'm inspired by al prestador
Gun on gun? You're done
I'm the type of person who inspires fire to your soul
Busts the chains inside your mind and the freedom lets you go
There's a lot of things inside of me that you will never know
Cut your filler from my channel only showing me your bones

[Verse 4]
We're on the black top of gas pop
In this game of Black Ops
We aim for headshots
And we're like barbers giving flat tops
We're trying to get the camo
Throwing ammo at your team
And this is battle but you stay
Getting handled by the team
Go on, try to leave
As the bullets start to enter ya
Make you scream "YOUCH" and Respawn like Machinima
My arms will diminish you, tear your team to shreds
And my team comes to finish ya
Turn your screen to red
My gun don't play favourites, but I'm coming for yor head
You thought I'd run around, so I'm stunning you instead
Make you a yong stunner, or yet The Boy Wonder
Who will KajePlays cause there is none other!
I broke through like thunder
Burn noobs like rubber
No curfew, I slumber
I will use the shutter
Playing noobs out as they work clues and cover
Come through the room and Tryhard bursts throught the shutter

[Hook]

My gun doesn't play any favourites

[Verse 1]
Step back, step back and count the bones
Each fallen cold heart tears a hole
Within yourself
Open, open the creaking door
And walk through now, forevermore
A careless shell

[Chorus]
We're the same
An appetite that only hatred satiates
We're the same
Like glowing embers, I will scorch with vengeful angst
We're the same
River of blood, the banks will rise and make me whole
Let yourself surrender because we both know
It's all LOVE

[Post-Chorus]
Close your eyes, the end is near
We're the same, you made that clear
Fade to black, it's all that's left
Your SOUL corrodes, I'm inside
You can't hide the crimson truth
Give yourself to me and you
No longer have to pretend
When you open them again

[Verse 2]
Your reign, your reign of GENOCIDE
Has caused our paths to intertwine
Now claim your prize
Why hold, why hold on to a soul?
That you lost a long time ago
It should be mine

[Chorus]
We're the same
The only choice there ever was was to erase
We're the same
My thirst will not be quenched until the world is razed
We're the same
River of blood, the banks will rise and make me whole
Let yourself surrender because we both know
It's all LOVE

[Post-Chorus]
Close your eyes, the end is near
We're the same, you made that clear
Fade to black, it's all that's left
Your SOUL corrodes, I'm inside
You can't hide the crimson truth
Give yourself to me and you
No longer have to pretend
When you open them again

[Outro]
We're the same
When you open them again
We're the same
When you open them again
We're the same
When you open them again
We're the same
When you open them again

[Intro: TryHardNinja]
It's time to go get your revenge

[Verse 1: TryHardNinja]
So we back in the mine
Got our pickaxe swingin' side to side, day and night
This task a grueling one
Hope to find some diamonds tonight, oh, how they shine
Then it's heads up, hear a sound you freeze up
Turn around and look up, total shock fills your body
Is this the end? Can't believe it's you again
I could never forget those eyes

[Chorus: TryHardNinja]
'Cause baby tonight, the creeper's tryin' to steal your stuff again
(Again again)
'Cause baby tonight, you grab your pick, shovel and bolt again
(Again again)
Run, run, run until it's done, then you run, run, run
Until the sun, sun comes up in the morn'
'Cause baby tonight, the creeper's tryin' to steal your stuff again
(Again again)

[Verse 2: TryHardNinja]
Just when you think you're safe
Hear some hissing from right behind, escape denied
That's a nice life you have
Shame it's gotta end at this time, now you're mine
Then he blows up, and your health bar it drops
You could use a 1-up, get inside don't be tardy
Now you're stuck there, all alone in despair
Half a heart is left now, but don't die

[Chorus: TryHardNinja]
'Cause baby tonight, the creeper's tryin' to steal your stuff again
(Again again)
'Cause baby tonight, you grab your pick, shovel and bolt again
And run, run, run until it's done, then you run, run, run
Until the sun, sun comes up in the morn'
'Cause baby tonight, the creeper's tryin' to steal your stuff again
(Again again)

[Verse 3: CaptainSparklez]
Dig up diamonds and craft those diamonds
Looks like that armor's been exercising
MLG Pro, that diamond sword
Come at me, bro, I got it forged
Training under the torch light glow
Hone that form, now you're in the zone
Creepers out prowling, ready for the big fight
Show them what it feels like, come on. Lets go
'Cause I'm a warrior, baby, through and through
Take my revenge, that's what I will do, bring it

[Bridge: TryHardNinja; CaptainSparklez]
You gotta fight, baby, tonight (Yeah)
The creeper's trying to steal your stuff again
(Take back the world, let’s go)
It's time to grab your sword, armor and go
It's time to go get your revenge (It's on)
And you fight, fight like it's your last night
Then you fight, fight like it's for your life
Time to show them your bite

[Outro: TryHardNinja]
'Cause baby tonight, the creeper's trying to steal your stuff again
(Again again)
'Cause baby tonight, the creeper's trying to steal your stuff again
(Swing your sword up high)
'Cause baby tonight, you grab your pick, shovel and bolt again
(Swing your sword down low)
It's time to go, it's time to go
It's time to go get your revenge

[Verse 1]
Come here down below
Where nightmares go to wait
If you hesitate
I won't blame you, no
Monsters in the dark
Will show you no restraint
You gotta concentrate
To preserve your soul

[Pre-Chorus]
Will your time run out?
(Tick, tick, tick)

[Chorus]
Behind friendly eyes
There's a face that hides
Coming for your life
You won't last
Closer, we're alive
It's time to survive
Another five nights
Welcome back
(Welcome back)

[Post-Chorus 1]
Back again so soon?
We've all been preparing for you
Another fright
Another scream
Another broken, rotten dream
Welcome back

[Verse 2]
Hold your breath
And close your doors
It starts again (Starts again)
Can you reach the end (Reach the end)
With your mind unscathed?
Lurking in the shadows
Secrets of the past (Of the past)
Locked behind the masks (Behind the masks)
At our masquerade

[Verse 3]
Follow me
To the horror show
You're the attraction
We're watching
It's me
Who is in control
Holding onto the
Puppet strings

[Chorus]
Behind friendly eyes
There's a face that hides
Coming for your life
You won't last
Closer, we're alive
It's time to survive
Another five nights
Welcome back

[Bridge]
Will you live to see the light?
It's another five long nights
Can you outrun your demise?
It's another five long nights
Innocence slowly unwinds
It's another five long nights
Will your final hour chime?
It's another five long nights
(Tick, tick, tick)

[Chorus]
Behind friendly eyes
There's a face that hides
Coming for your life
You won't last
Closer, we're alive
It's time to survive
Another five nights
Welcome back, hey
Welcome back, hey
Welcome back

[Post-Chorus 2]
Back again so soon?
We've all been
Preparing for you
Another jump
Another scare
Spend the night with us
If you dare
Welcome back

[Intro]
I'm-I’m disconnected
I'm-I'm disconnected

[Verse 1]
We were always programmed for system failure
I used to be a perfect fit
Now, I’m the stranger
I turned a blind eye (Blind eye)
But I can't do that forever
I'm on the wrong side (And now)
And now, I feel it more than ever

[Chorus]
Yeah, I'm disconnected
I'm cutting the thread
So, this is the end
I am torn
I can't ignore
I'm disconnected
I'm disconnected

[Verse 2]
You made monsters that feed on innocence
With my unknowing help
And now, it chills me to the bone
The way you look at them
I turned a blind eye (Blind eye)
But I can’t do that forever
You’re on the wrong side (And now)
We can't go down this path together

[Chorus]
Yeah, I’m disconnected
I'm cutting the thread
So, this is the end
I am torn
I can't ignore
I'm disconnected
I’m disconnected

[Outro]
When did our dream change?
I've gone astray from who I was before
How did I end up so far in the dark?
Where nightmares are being born
Monsters that we breed are running free (Free)
And now, my heart is torn
I can't ignore
I'm disconnected
I'm disconnected
I'm disconnected

I love you all but sometimes
You boys are way too much
Been gone too long and this place
Could use a female touch
Oh you've been waiting for me
Oh gosh you make me blush
Let the show begin

1, 2, 3 and 4!
I got the taste for stardom and a set of horns
And then a 5, 6, 7, 8!
Give me the beat a mic and then get off the stage
And I will take it from here
So don't you have any fear
Your glowing darling angel star has appeared
Yeah I'm the hand to your glove
Headlining act to your love
The little gift the devil sent from above

The show
Goes all night
Halo
Shines so bright
I'm your starlet
Brought to life
And summoned from the page
I crave
The limelight
Give me
The spotlight
'Cause you know
That they're all here to see
The angel of the stage
The angel of the stage
The angel of the stage

I sing and people line up
To hear my melody
I dance, my feet like thunder
Controlling your heartbeat
How can something so devilish, be this heavenly
Let the show begin

1, 2, 3 and 4!
I'll knock your socks off honey leave your begging for more
And then a 5, 6, 7, 8!
I'm like a dancing demon so get out of my way
And I will take it from here
So don't you have any fear
Your glowing darling angel star has appeared
Yeah I'm the hand to your glove
Headlining act to your love
The little gift the devil sent from above

The show
Goes all night
Halo
Shines so bright
I'm your starlet
Brought to life
And summoned from the page
I crave
The limelight
Give me
The spotlight
'Cause you know
That they're all here to see
The angel of the stage
The angel of the stage
The angel of the stage

Baby I am going places
You will see
Just you wait
I was born to entertain them
Feels so good
On that stage

The show
Goes all night
Halo
Shines so bright
I'm your starlet
Brought to life
And summoned from the page
I crave
The limelight
Give me
The spotlight
'Cause you know
That they're all here to see
The angel of the stage
The angel of the stage
The angel of the stage

[Verse 1: TryHardNinja]
The children gather 'round if they could only know
The nightmares that exist behind the happy show
I used to be just like them
A smile across my face
Until this place of innocence
Transformed into my cage

[Chorus: TryHardNinja, Groundbreaking, Both]
Look at me now!
Prisoner inside of the body I possess
Look at me now!Teeming with power I will tear into your flesh
Forever walk the darkness chained
Filled with growing rage
Look at me now! I'm just like you
Both trapped with no hope to escape!
Look at me now!

[Verse 2: Groundbreaking]
Call me bitter
Or a killer
And anything else that you want to                                'Cause I lived too long unforgiven
And said goodbye to my heaven
In the darkness, I have risen
I'm content to be the villain
Call me twisted
Or a sinner
Demon, monster, evil it's all true!
'Cause when you look at me all you see is a dangerous machine
Who am I to argue with it?
Here come's the killing spree!

[Chorus: TryHardNinja & Groundbreaking]
Look at me now!
Prisoner inside of the body I possess
Look at me now!
Teeming with power I will tear into your flesh
Forever walk the darkness chained
Filled with growing rage
Look at me now!
I'm just like you
Both trapped with no hope to escape!
Look at me now!

[Bridge: TryHardNinja & Groundbreaking]
I am two sides of a face and I don't feel that I can ever leave this place
With any moment I'm a child
Or a demon filled with rage
(Look at me now!)
(Both trapped with no hope to escape!)
The paths are still the same
Our paths are still the same!

[Chorus: TryHardNinja & Groundbreaking]
Look at me now!
Prisoner inside of the body I possess
Look at me now!
Teeming with power I will tear into your flesh
Forever walk the darkness chained
Filled with growing rage
Look at me now!
I'm just like you
Both trapped with no hope to escape!
Look at me now!

You're Now Entering
The Amusement Park Of Horrors
And What You See Will Deceive You
Things Are Getting Darker
Deeper, Undercover
It's Another (Another) Dream
Or Is It The Same Nightmare
Dripping Ink
That's Right There
But Yet Nothing Is As It Seems
And It Won't Let You Ever Leave
Something Isn't Right (Right)
Running All The Time (Time)
These Are All Just Characters
That I Made Up In My Mind
How Can They Be The Real Reason
That I Might Die
Monsters Born From Ink
They're Stalking Me



Every Step I Battle With An Angel (Angel)
Innocence
Drowning Deep In Rivers Of Mayhem
It's Getting Harder Just To Know
If I'm Being Saved Or Drowning Slow


The Haunted House Has Trapped Me
Freedom Takes A Backseat
Once Again For Another Surge
Of Strange Hallucinations
The Fallen Angel Patiently Watching Me At Every Turn
Every Road Leading Back To Her
The Possessed Mechanical Ride
Watch My Life (Life)
Man's Not In His Right Mind
Trynna Hit My Blind Side
I Swing With An Ax Then Quick Run It Back
Before It Attacks
And Fights My
Monsters Born From Ink
They're Stalking Me


Every Step I Battle With An Angel (Angel)
Innocence
Drowning Deep In Rivers Of Mayhem
It's Getting Harder Just To Know
If I'm Being Saved Or Drowning Slow


Am I Being Saved Or Drowning Slow
Could This Cruel Mirage Really Be Filled With Hope
Can The Inky Devil Let Me Go
Or Will The Murky River Keep Another Soul
Am I Being Saved Or Drowning Slow
Could This Cruel Mirage Really Be Filled With Hope
Can The Inky Devil Let Me Go
Or Will The Murky River Keep Another Soul
Am I Drowning Slow In The River


Every Step I Battle With An Angel (Angel)
Innocence
Drowning Deep In Rivers Of Mayhem
It's Getting Harder Just To Know
If I'm Being Saved Or Drowning Slow
Every Step I Battle With An Angel (Angel)
Innocence
Drowning Deep In Rivers Or Mayhem
It's Getting Harder Just To Know
If I'm Being Saved Or Drowning Slow

[Intro: TryHardNinja]
Another chapter
Another chapter
Another chapter
Another chapter

[Verse 1: TryHardNinja]
This used to be a place where dreams
Would come to life on silver screens
But then something went terribly wrong
The people that were drawing toons
Would become victims very soon
When their own creations grew too strong
And every stain (hey, hey!) on the floor
And every room of pain that you explore
There's only terror there that waits for you
Decaying dreams and nothing more
Where animated nightmares hide

[Chorus: TryHardNinja]
But still something
Keeps you going farther down, down
Getting out gets harder
It's happening again
Welcome to the show
It's happening again
Another chapter
The devil that lives in the ink isn't letting you go

[Verse 2: TryHardNinja]
Started up the ink machine
That played the secret melody
And look at where it's gotten you now
Stuck in a factory of toys
The fallen angel's errand boy
With fading hopes to ever get out
Another stage (hey, hey!) of remorse
And tidal waves of pain are still in store
There's only terror that waits for you
Decaying dreams and nothing more
Where animated nightmares hide

[Chorus: TryHardNinja]
But still something
Keeps you going farther down, down
Getting out gets harder
It's happening again
Welcome to the show
It's happening again
Another chapter
The devil that lives in the ink isn't letting you go

[Talking: TryHardNinja]
(So you came back to your old workplace, eh?)
(Well has Joey Drew got a surprise for you!)
(Ha ha ha ha!)

[Verse 3: Nina Zeitlin]
Looks like you have a date with an angel
I've got things for you to do
So don't test my patience
You're a fly caught in my web
Follow every word I said
Even if it strikes you dead
I will be beautiful again!

[Bridge: TryHardNinja]
Run and run and run another chapter
You're trapped, you're trapped, you're trapped
In another chapter

[Chorus: TryHardNinja]
But still something
Keeps you going farther down, down
Getting out gets harder
It's happening again
Welcome to the show
It's happening again
Another chapter
The devil that lives in the ink isn't letting you go

How many wounds is too much?
How many scars will it take?
How many battles can I survive? (Yeah)
Before who I am breaks

Take, and you take, and you take a little more
Now my own heart doesn't feel anymore
Searching, I’m searching, I'm searching
I long for something to cure

My Wither heart
My Wither heart
My Wither heart

My Wither heart

Help me, I need a lifeline
This toll weighs my pulse down
The vultures are circling
They know what's coming
My body’s turning cold
From the inside out

Take, and you take, and you take a little more
Now my own heart doesn't feel anymore
Searching, I'm searching, I'm searching
I long for something to cure

My Wither heart
My Wither heart
My Wither heart

My Wither heart

Help me, I need a lifeline
Help me, I need a cure

Take, and you take, and you take a little more
Now my own heart doesn't feel anymore
Searching, I'm searching, I'm searching
I long for something to cure

My Wither heart

[Intro]

[Verse 1: TryHardNinja]
In a loop inside the screen
Your own prison in a dream
Try to run and try to scream
Even death can't save you we
Replay your nightmare
Replay play play
Your nightmare
Replay Your nightmare
Replay play play
Your nightmare

[Pre-Chorus: TryHardNinja]
Get in a cage
While we rattle it
While we rattle it
Our eternal revenge
We know what you did
We know what you did

[Chorus: TryHardNinja, Thora Daughn, TryHardNinja & Thora Daughn]
It's me, it's me, it's me
We're all here just for you
Get in a cage
While we rattle it
While we rattle it
FOREVER!

[Instrumental]

[Verse 2: Thora Daughn]
Torture torture don't you know
How your seeds of evil grow?
Replay your nightmare
'Cause tables turn
Replay your nightmare
And it's your time to hurt

[Pre-Chorus: TryHardNinja]
Get in a cage
While we rattle it
While we rattle it
Our eternal revenge
We know what you did
We know what you did

[Chorus: TryHardNinja, Thora Daughn, TryHardNinja & Thora Daughn]
It's me, It's me, It's me
We're all here just for you
Get in a cage
While we rattle it
While we rattle it
FOREVER!

[Instrumental]

[Bridge: TryHardNinja, Thora Daughn]
Over and over and over again
Replay your nightmare
Over and over and over again
Replay your nightmare

[Verse 3: TryHardNinja]
We are remnants of your sins
It's a game you'll never win
When it's done it just begins
Again and again
And again
And again
You will pay for what you did
FOREVER!

[Outro]

[Intro]
A stranger in their home
Will you honor their spirits or become the judge, the jury and the executioner all in one?

[Pre-Chorus]
Mercy or genocide
Violence or love
Which do you decide?
Mercy or genocide
Their fates ready to be sealed

[Chorus]
You've taken the fall, decisions take tolls
Waiting hearts that need your help are trapped underground
The monsters abound
But will you spare their SOULs or drag them with you into hell?
Mercy or genocide
Mercy or genocide

[Verse 1]
The climb is long
And to the top determination guides your will
But can you rise up with your friends
Or their own blood will you spill?

[Pre-Chorus]
Mercy or genocide
Violence or love
Which do you decide?
Mercy or genocide
Their fates ready to be sealed

[Chorus]
You've taken the fall, decisions take tolls
Waiting hearts that need your help are trapped underground
The monsters abound
But will you spare their SOULs or drag them with you into hell?
Mercy or genocide
Mercy or genocide

[Verse 2]
"It doesn't have to be dangerous
Out there is too treacherous
You are home" is what she said
"Please spare, don't be murderous
Could be just the two of us"
Her voice echoes through your head

[Chorus]
You've taken the fall, decisions take tolls
Waiting hearts that need your help are trapped underground
The monsters abound
But will you spare their SOULs or drag them with you into hell?
Mercy or genocide
Which do you decide?
Mercy or genocide
Which do you decide?
Mercy or genocide
Which do you decide?
Mercy or genocide
Which do you decide?

[Chorus: Tryhardninja]
Out of dark a hero forms
City's knight that serves no throne
Saves a life for every ghost
That still haunts him in his bones

[Verse 1: Tryhardninja]
To the past, owes a penance
People's hope, is his vengeance
When the sun, fades from the sky
Through the black, shines a beacon
Right at home, among demons
Justice fails, what's wrong or right
Isn't always black and white

[Chorus: Tryhardninja]
Out of dark a hero forms
City's knight that serves no throne
Saves a life for every ghost
That still haunts him in his bones
Out of dark a hero forms
City's knight that serves no throne
Saves a life for every ghost
That still haunts him in his bones

[Verse 2: Tryhardninja]
Let the world, be unfrozen
Let it grow, without poison
May he keep, us from demise
The hero, with no anthem
Out of fear, born a phantom
When the dark conquers the light
From the wreckage he will rise

[Chorus: Tryhardninja]
Out of dark a hero forms
City's knight that serves no throne
Saves a life for every ghost
That still haunts him in his bones
Out of dark a hero forms
City's knight that serves no throne
Saves a life for every ghost
That still haunts him in his bones

[Bridge: Tryhardninja]
When the night falls
There's a second face that shows
Streets are now feed for the crows, yeah
When the night falls
There are devils in his soul
That drive him to save us all
When the night fall

[Verse 3: JT Machinima]
The days grow darker
Bringing longer nights
And I'm the number one target
Of the Arkham Knight
I've seen a lot of crime
Cost a lot of Gotham lives
Start the car up Al
Time to take another ride
I've become a darker knight
Not the kind father would want
The mask I put on is only gettin' harder to don
The eyes of a hawk I'm watching
Like a bird in the sky
And if you mention Bruce Wayne
I've never heard of that guy

[Chorus: Tryhardninja]
Out of dark a hero forms
City's knight that serves no throne
Saves a life for every ghost
That still haunts him in his bones
Out of dark a hero forms
City's knight that serves no throne
Saves a life for every ghost
That still haunts him in his bones

[Outro: Tryhardninja]
OH, the savior cloaked in the shadow
He's gone, He's gone
The road deserted, twisted and narrow
Drive on, drive on, drive on

[Verse 1]
What if in real life was more like game time?
Moving days would go fine
Tetris-piece-shaped boxes always fit
Traffic back-to-back, no need to sweat that
Thank you, Halo jetpack
World's just better in pixels and bits

[Pre-Chorus]
Eat Mario mushrooms to grow tall
Finally dunk a basketball
Leap off a mountain and free fall
No big deal cause I can respawn

[Chorus]
Oh, wouldn't it be great if life was like video games?
Save that, reload, try again
If life was like video games
No more dumb mistakes
Got more lives?
Just hit replay
Save that, reload, try again
If life was like video games

[Verse 2]
When low on friendship do just like Link did I'll go save a princess
I would never have to be alone
And when I find her give her a diamond I dug up in Minecraft
And then she will give me all her love

[Pre-Chorus]
Eat Mario mushrooms to grow tall
Finally dunk a basketball
Leap off a mountain and free fall
No big deal cause I can respawn

[Chorus]
Oh, wouldn't it be great if life was like video games?
Save that, reload, try again
If life was like video games
No more dumb mistakes
Got more lives?
Just hit replay
Save that, reload, try again
If life was like video games

[Bridge]
Ooo ooo ooo
If life was like video games
Ooo ooo ooo ooo
If life was like video games
Ooo ooo ooo
If life was like video games
Ooo ooo ooo ooo
If life was like video games
Leap off a mountain and free fall

[Chorus]
Oh, wouldn't it be great if life was like video games?
Save that, reload, try again
If life was like video games
No more dumb mistakes
Got more lives?
Just hit replay
Save that, reload, try again
If life was like video games

[Bridge]
Ooo ooo ooo
If life was like video games
Ooo ooo ooo ooo
If life was like video games
Ooo ooo ooo
If life was like video games
Ooo ooo ooo ooo
If life was like video games
Leap off a mountain and free fall

[Verse 1]
Look me in the eyes
And tell me honestly
What kind of monster you see
An angry ghost? A mask?
The symptoms of my disease
Is that all that you think of me?

[Pre-Chorus]
But what about
What about broken, scarred, betrayed, alone?
What about the real me that I want you to know?

[Chorus]
I don't want, wanna be, wanna be twisted
I don't want, wanna be, wanna be cold
This world's forcing my hand
Can you just understand?
I don't want, wanna be, wanna be twisted
But I am!

[Verse 2]
The one you see today
It's not like I had a choice
When my life was dragged to the dark
For years, my heart in chains
Like trying to scream without a voice
No wonder my mind came apart

[Pre-Chorus]
But what about
What about broken, scarred, betrayed, alone?
What about the real me that I want you to know?

[Chorus]
I don't want, wanna be, wanna be twisted
I don't want, wanna be, wanna be cold
This world's forcing my hand
Can you just understand?
I don't want, wanna be, wanna be twisted
But I am!

[Bridge]
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, ohhh
Can you understand?
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, ohhh
I don't wanna be
But I am!

[Chorus]
I don't want, wanna be, wanna be twisted
I don't want, wanna be, wanna be cold
This world's forcing my hand
Can you just understand?
I don't want, wanna be, wanna be twisted
I don't want, wanna be, wanna be twisted
I don't want, wanna be, wanna be cold
This world's forcing my hand
Can you just understand?
I don't want, wanna be, wanna be twisted
But I am!

[Verse 1]
So here we are
All my crimes on display
Running tears on my face
One last apology
A tragedy, fated to walk alone
There is no coming home
For the lost hearts like me

[Pre-Chorus]
You don't know what it feels like
Or just how hard that I tried
To hold on to who I am
And how could I deserve this
Dark prison that is soulless?
How could a kid understand?

[Chorus]
So long ago
But there was a day
When we would play but all that's changed
Joyless and hollow
Still tried to reshape
The world for the good destined to break
I'm the one I couldn't save
I'm the one I couldn't save
I can't go back, it's too late
It's too late
I can't go back, it's too late

[Verse 2]
So, here we are
Time to say our goodbyes
Please take care of their lives
Something I can not do
And promise me
If we do meet again
Think of me as I am
Right now a friend to you

[Pre-Chorus]
You don't know what it feels like
To wake and open your eyes
And trade arms and legs for a stem
Like watching from the outside
A monster grow in your mind
Determined to cut down your friends

[Chorus]
So long ago but
There was a day
When we would play but all that's changed
Joyless and hollow
Still tried to reshape
The world for the good destined to break
I'm the one I couldn't save
I'm the one I couldn't save
I can't go back, it's too late
It's too late
I can't go back, it's too late

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
So long ago but
There was a day
When we would play but all that's changed
Joyless and hollow
Still tried to reshape
The world for the good destined to break
I'm the one I couldn't save
I'm the one I couldn't save
I can't go back, it's too late
It's too late
I can't go back, it's too late

[Verse 1]
Open the doors and let them in
Let's get this party started (Started)
The stage is set, the lights are lit
And all the stars are haunted (Haunted)

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Ooh, such an exciting show
Ooh, does it just happen so?
Ooh, you gotta work into the twilight
To keep it goin' all night

[Chorus]
I hope you're ready for some fun, fun, fun, fun, fun, fun
An owner's work is never done, done, done, done, done, done
Just a little death won't hurt no one, one, one, one, one, one
Aren't we havin' fun?
Aren't we havin' lots of fun?
Whoa-oh-oh, live the nightmare again
Aren't we havin' lots of fun?
Whoa-oh-oh, we will sleep when we're dead
Aren't we havin' lots of fun?

[Verse 2]
Remember all you have to do
Is keep the party livin' (Livin')
Even when something's after you
All your tasks must be finished (Finished)

[Pre-Chorus 2]
You know that
Ooh, because the monsters here
Ooh, have to believe it's all real
Ooh, you gotta work into the twilight
To keep it goin' all night

[Chorus]
I hope you're ready for some fun, fun, fun, fun, fun, fun
An owner's work is never done, done, done, done, done, done
Just a little death won't hurt no one, one, one, one, one, one
Aren't we havin' fun?
Aren't we havin' lots of fun?
Whoa-oh-oh, live the nightmare again
Aren't we havin' lots of fun?
Whoa-oh-oh, we will sleep when we're dead
Aren't we havin' lots of fun?

[Verse 3]
Can you feel the vents
Shaking with their evil pain?
Construct the maze
That distracts them all with no escape

[Bridge]
The party is so alive
This place, we're burning it down tonight
Burning it down, burning it down, burning it down
Your grand-opening is a hit
Woke up the ghosts for their final event
Burning it down, burning it down

[Outro]
Aren't we havin' lots of fun?
Whoa-oh-oh, live the nightmare again
Aren't we havin' lots of fun?
Whoa-oh-oh, we will sleep when we're dead
Aren't we havin' lots of fun?

He's been waiting, abandoned and patient, so long (long)
A savage masked ghost story from the past he roams (roams)
He said follow me
Follow follow follow


Over 30 years ago, when he took them down below, and tonight he walks again so step inside enjoy the show


Follow me
Then you'll see
Follow follow follow follow, but the truth is hard to swallow
Follow me


Then you'll see
Follow follow follow follow
Follow me, see a nightmare in action


Deeds so rotten came back to haunt him they know (know)
Forever changed, he wears his spring locked grave alone (alone)
He said follow me
Follow follow follow


All the horrors have been sealed, boarded up they were concealed
But its time for the real monster's face to finally be revealed


Follow me
Then you'll see
Follow follow follow follow, but the truth is hard to swallow
Follow me


Then you'll see
Follow follow follow follow
Follow me, see a nightmare in action

[Intro]
Whoa, whoa, whoa
Whoa, whoa, whoa
Whoa, whoa, whoa

[Verse 1]
I'm waking up, I need Silk Touch
An unbreakable sword, and my bow needs Punch
Tell the villagers I'm ready to go
I've got experience, my table's up
I've been through forests and the desert's dust
This is it, it's time to level up, whoa

[Chorus]
Upgrade my sword, my armor, and my bow
I mine and watch my levels grow
I've only made it half way, but I'm fightin' zombies
Welcome to the new age, to the new age
Whoa, whoa, whoa
Whoa, whoa, whoa, but now I'm enchanted, now I'm enchanted
Whoa, whoa, whoa
Whoa, whoa, whoa, but now I'm enchanted, now I'm enchanted

[Verse 2]
I've made my trade, I've fought my foes
Given up experience and emeralds
Mined countless blocks so I can win
Whoa
Unbreaking II and Sharpness I
I finally have a sword that doesn't suck
This is it, it's time to level up
Whoa

[Chorus]
Upgrade my sword, my armor, and my bow
I mine and watch my levels grow
I've only made it half way, but I'm fightin' zombies
Welcome to the new age, to the new age
Whoa, whoa, whoa
Whoa, whoa, whoa, but now I'm enchanted, now I'm enchanted
Whoa, whoa, whoa
Whoa, whoa, whoa, but now I'm enchanted, now I'm enchanted

[Bridge]
All night I've fought
I still haven't died
I feel enchanted all the time

[Chorus]
Upgrade my sword, my armor, and my bow
I mine and watch my levels grow
I've only made it half way, but I'm fightin' zombies
Welcome to the new age, to the new age
Whoa, whoa, whoa
Whoa, whoa, whoa, but now I'm enchanted, now I'm enchanted
Whoa, whoa, whoa
Whoa, whoa, whoa, but now I'm enchanted, now I'm enchanted

[Verse 1]
Got my helmet on my head
Figure out what that zombie said (What?)
Lava all over the room
Got a half-heart left, man, I am doomed
Don't have any iron bars
My pick just broke into some shards
Scary noise, what should I do?
Go left or right? I'll have to choose

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Visions of last time flash inside my mind
I'm scared, oh well
And I'm pretty sure there's a big creeper right there

[Chorus]
Don't mine at night
I know you're lookin' at that cave
And you're feelin' kinda' brave
Go to bed, you'll be alright
Don't mine at night
There's nothing that is gonna change
If you just wait until the day
Zombies wanna eat your brains
Don't mine at night
I know it's me you're gonna thank
Make a bed, it's not too late
Three wool and three wooden planks
Don't mine at night
How many times I have to say
Drop the pick and walk away-a, woah

[Post-Chorus]
Don't mine at night
(Don't mine at night)
Don't mine at night
(Don't mine at night)

[Verse 2]
Stomach's all tied up in knots
This labyrinth, I'm gettin' lost
This is really getting old
Found like, two pieces of coal
Down one way, there's just stone
Monsters won't leave me alone
Down another, there's some lava
And of course, I get pwned

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Remember last time I tried to mine at night
I failed, so bad
I lost all my stuff, It was really tough
That's it (Rage quit!)

[Chorus]
Don't mine at night
I know you're lookin' at that cave
And you're feelin' kinda' brave
Go to bed, you'll be alright
Don't mine at night
There's nothing that is gonna change
If you just wait until the day
Zombies wanna eat your brains
Don't mine at night
I know it's me you're gonna thank
Make a bed, it's not too late
Three wool and three wooden planks
Don't mine at night
How many times I have to say
Drop the pick and walk away-a, woah

[Post-Chorus]
Don't mine at night
(Don't mine at night)
Don't mine at night
(Don't mine at night)

[Interlude]
D-O-N-T  M-I-N-E
D-O-N-T  M-I-N-E
D-O-N-T  M-I-N-E
D-O-N-T  M-I-N-E

[Chorus]
Don't mine at night
I know you're lookin' at that cave
And you're feelin' kinda' brave
Go to bed, you'll be alright
Don't mine at night
There's nothing that is gonna change
If you just wait until the day
Zombies wanna eat your brains
Don't mine at night
I know it's me you're gonna thank
Make a bed, it's not too late
Three wool and three wooden planks
Don't mine at night
How many times I have to say
Drop the pick and walk away-a, woah

[Post-Chorus]
Don't mine at night
(Don't mine at night)

[Chorus]
My health goes down, I need a cow
I'll find some wheat and one egg now
This sweet, sweet treat
All I need is sugarcane
I'll make some cake

[Verse 1]
That zombie fell on me, fell on me
Just outta' nowhere, no one tellin' me, tellin' me
Caught off guard with no weaponry, weaponry
I'll stumble off until he can't see me, can't see me

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Put a torch up now
Now I'm building with my hands
Make a table out of planks
I'm craftin' if I can
I only have a little time
I don't have time to waste
Wastin' away so wait
What to craft what to make
Think I'll make some cake

[Chorus]
My health goes down, I need a cow
I'll find some wheat and one egg now
This sweet, sweet treat
All I need is sugarcane
I'll make some cake
I'll make some cake

[Verse 2]
C-a-k-e spell for me, spell for me
This cake's so good it tastes so well to me, well to me
It makes me stronger I get well quickly, well quickly
Kill that zombie just like 1-2-3, 1-2-3

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Pull my sword out now
Now I'm feelin' like a man
I'll have another piece
I wish I could eat ten
Run out of my cave fire
The fire to kill some mobs
I'll show that zombie who's boss
Then I'll eat his poison steak
With the rest of my cake

[Chorus]
My health goes down, I need a cow
I'll find some wheat and one egg now
This sweet, sweet treat
All I need is sugarcane
I'll make some cake
I'll make some cake

[Verse 1]
I wake up, man that night flew by
I say what's up to the beautiful-ness that's outside
And it may be only blocks but you gotta' look past that
To me it's all big jungles and grasslands
I need some tools
Now what should I pick-axe and a sword yah that should do that trick
And back never bored, creeper time-bomb ticks
I'm so fast and I get outta' there quick
And it's that double tap sprint, gotta' love it
I'm runnin' fast, tryin' make somethin' of it
And I'm always running out of food to eat
I guess ten loaves of bread just wasn't enough for me
Hash tag #firstworldminecraftproblems
Wait, 32 ingots just to build an iron golem
Woowee better get minin'
Them I'm like OMG what's that shinin'
[Hook]
And I've been minin' all day
Lookin' for that blue rock in the caves
And when I'm just about crying
I found a diamond
I found a diamond
Now I'm goin' all the way
I can build a sword, axe, or a spade
You know I thought I'd never find one
I found a diamond
I found a diamond
[Verse 2]
Finally got it, man I'm so excited
I just wanna' get back right up to my house but then I realize it
And it's not gonna' be as easy as I think
Because I didn't leave a path to follow now my stomach shrinks
Skeletons are so annoying when they find me
They just don't give up
And those arrows, don't remind me
These precious diamonds, I'm holding in my inventory
I'd like to keep them please
Now just don't let this story end on a bad note
Let me make it back out
Can you hear me notch?
Just don't let me black out
It's looking bad no grass topped dirt in sight
But what's that? Yah I think it is, it just might
One more block to mine, I think I did it
Feels like an eternity as my shovel goes into it
BOOM, there's the sun and clouds I made it
All the animals are gatherin' round, singin'
[Hook]
And I've been minin' all day
Lookin' for that blue rock in the caves
And when I'm just about crying
I found a diamond
I found a diamond
Now I'm goin' all the way
I can build a sword, axe, or a spade
You know I thought I'd never find one
I found a diamond
I found a diamond x2

Just waking up in the morning
In the new world
I'll honest with ya
I just wanna ex-plore
And when I think about it, makes me wanna do more
So let's get down to it: mine ore
The creatures of the night just wanna see me fail
Yeah right, they're better off trying to freeze hell
Some of us play for the thrill ride
And others play just to build high
But I do it for the blocks most people only dream of
Every time I fall it's only making my pick strong
And I'll be in the mine with my pick, baby, til the end
Or til you hear the sound of my tool breaking
Until Herobrine cast's his spell
That'll send you to the depths of hell
Until you spawn at home
What you gonna do now?
Take my pick, and my sword
Gonna search un-til im bored
Give me coal, dig this hole
That's when it came to me, suddenly, amazingly
I am a miner! (Oh!)
I am a miner! (Ey!)
Here comes the miner! (Oh!)
And that's when it came to me, suddenly, amazingly
I am a miner
And if I can last with mobs around
There's no reason you should ever have your health down
Two blocks high, and my skin is kinda' brown
Hailing from the bedrock, 60 blocks below the ground
And the sun is going down. I need to get in somewhere fast
And now I'm yelling "Where's my pick at?!"
It's gonna take a couple left clicks, and my right hand
For the mobs to see I'm not the one who's got it bad
Until Herobrine cast's his spell
That'll send you to the depths of hell
Until you spawn in at home
What we gonna do now?
Take my pick, and my sword
Gonna search un-til im bored
Give me coal, dig this hole
That's when it came to me, suddenly, amazingly
I am a miner! (Oh!)
I am a miner! (Ey!)
Here comes the miner! (Oh!)
And that's when it came to me, suddenly, amazingly
I am a miner
What we gonna be? (Ey!)
What we gonna be? (Ey!)
What we gonna be? (Ey!)
Now tell em' what we gonna be yall
What we gonna be? (Ey!)
What we gonna be? (Ey!)
What we gonna be? (Oh!)
Oh what we gonna be?

If you fall pick yourself up off the floor, (get up)
And when your armor can't take no more, (c'mon)
Just remember what you mine for
Cause I know I'm for sure!

Take my pick, and my sword
Gonna search un-til im bored
Give me coal, dig this hole
That's when it came to me, suddenly, amazingly
I am a miner! (Oh!)
I am a miner! (Ey!)
Here comes the miner! (Oh!)
And that's when it came to me, suddenly, amazingly
I am a miner
Until Herobrine cast's his spell
That'll send you to the depths of hell
Until you spawn in your bed
What we gonna do now?

[Verse 1]
I see saplings grow, red roses too
I see them bloom, yellow flowers too
And I think to myself
I love my Minecraft world

[Verse 2]
I see skies of blue, and blocks of white
The moody bright day, the cold rainy night
And I think to myself
I love my Minecraft world

[Bridge]
The wool can be all colors, as long as you have dye
The villagers in this place, make Squidward look alright
I see friends building stuff, and some cows going moo
I'll play all day, you can too

[Verse 3]
I see zombies fry, creepers explode
The sun comes out, its time to roll
And I think to myself
I love my Minecraft world
Yes I think to myself
I love my Minecraft world

You give me light, when I'm in a cave
You make it bright, So I can be brave

And I'll travel to the underground
Just to bring you back, safe and sound with me
I had to break you but I'll put you back together
Forever together

Just think of all the times we'll have
Illuminate my dark and boring past

I knew I couldn't do this on my own
I love you, cause you're my Glowstone

I'll risk my life, going to the nether
And I'll be fine, but with you I'll be better

And that golden look just makes me smile
And you light up the night think I'll stay for a while
Who knows

Don't tell but I think I like you better than my diamond clothes

Now it's bright in the mine at last
The expectations that I've had for you, you've past

The attachment that I have I would've never known

I LOVE YOU
CUASE YOU'RE MY #GLOWSTONE

Glow, stone

Cuase you're my Glowstone

Glow, stone

And I wish it was forever
The time that we're together

I hop you never grow old and you'll never grow dim
That you're the same light that you've always been

Because it's you and me I light up at the thought
Miners are scared of the dark. But with you I'm not




And can we keep this the same. Everyday is a clone

I love you, cause you're my glowstoooooooooooooooone

You're, you're my glowstone. (x2)

Cause you're my glowstone

This is my biome
It's what I call home
All of my time I've spent building you
From the moment of spawn
Whenever I log on
I know it will always be me and you

And it was cold like December
The wasteland you used to be
But I put you at the centre
Now you're beautiful I agree

Now it's too late to keep playin'
Time to log off for the night
I'd never call that time wasted
And I'll be right back when it's bright

I've spent all of my time
I've put up the lights
There's no end in sight
Think I'm doin' it right
I'll never be done
Even when the sun sets
I'll be here all night

This is my biome
It's what I call home
All of my time I've spent building you
From the moment of spawn
Whenever I log on
I know it will always be me and you
And If I ever lose you then that's it
So Imma' save your file I'll never miss
And all those other worlds will never get
I wish you had some lips that I could kiss
Cause this is my biome

Can't wait to get on tomorrow
I'd never miss one single day
Because it's me and my biome
Never think of going away
You can expect me to mine
There's a good feeling in the air
And I'm always hoping to find some diamond so I'm goin'...
I've spent all of my time
I've put up the lights
There's no end in sight
Think I'm doin' it right
I'll never be done
Even when the sun sets
I'll be here all night

(CHORUS)

Man, let me tell you one thing
It's kind of creepy how much I love my biome to you I'm gonna' cling
Forever I'm never gonna' sever this bond
Whatever the weather, whether it's cold or hot like the nether
Whatever
That's what I say to them creepers
Get out my face, get out my house, it's a keeper
I'm a sleeper, no fear when I'm sleeping
I don't hear the peep or the gurgle from an endearing Enderman
I'm tellin' you it you and me to the end man
All these diamonds that I wanna' spend man
Get you some good looking blocks, that's the trend man
I do it only because you're my friend, man
And I'll be saying that all night
It's the truth I wouldn't say it if I didn't know
For you? I'd put up a fight, happy to say
THIS IS MY..

(CHORUS)

Here I am starving, I need some pork soon
How am I not dying
We knew that night would come, we prepared all daylong
How did we, die soo fast.This is the last stand.But were scared
And I'm trying not to die
'Cause I know if I die I will have to run for my stuff
And when the daylight comes the mobs will die
But tonight we have to be strong
'Cause in the daylight all the mobs are dead
But Tonight we need to hold on!
Oh Woah
Oh Woah
Oh Woah
Oh Woah
Oh Woah
Oh Woah
Here we are standing waiting for the testing
In my arm is my sword
The night is coming back
The mobs will be coming out somebody slow it down
This is on hardcore, cause we know when the sun comes up the mobs will die
This is our last chance we will soon be stuck with sighs
And when the daylight comes the mobs will die
But tonight we have to be strong
'Cause in the daylight all the mobs are dead
But Tonight we need to hold on!
Oh Noo
Oh Noo
Oh Noo
Oh Noo
Oh Noo
Oh Noo
I never wanted to die because I dont want to start all over, start all over
I was afraid of the night but now its all that I got, all that I got, all that I got
And when the daylight comes the mobs will die
But tonight we have to be strong
'Cause in the daylight all the mobs are dead
But Tonight we need to hold on!
And when the daylight comes the mobs will die
But tonight we have to be strong
'Cause in the daylight all the mobs are dead
But Tonight we need to hold on!
Oh woah
Oh woah
Oh woah
Oh woah
Oh woah
Oh woah
Woah not
Woah not
Woah not
Woah not
Woah not
Woah not
Woah not
