[Verse 1]
Her day starts with a coffee and ends with a wine
Takes forever getting ready so she's never on time for anything
When she gets that "come get me" look in her eyes
Well, it kinda scares me, the way that she drives me wild
When she drives me wild

[Chorus]
Beautiful, crazy, she can't help but amaze me
The way that she dances, ain't afraid to take chances
And wears her heart on her sleeve
Yeah, she's crazy but her crazy's beautiful to me

[Verse 2]
She makes plans for the weekend, can't wait to go out
Till she changes her mind
Says, "Let's stay on the couch and watch TV"
And she falls asleep

[Chorus]
Beautiful, crazy, she can't help but amaze me
The way that she dances, ain't afraid to take chances
And wears her heart on her sleeve
Yeah, she's crazy but her crazy's beautiful to me

[Bridge]
She's unpredictable, unforgettable
It's unusual, unbelievable
How I'm such a fool, yeah, I'm such a fool for her

[Chorus]
Beautiful, crazy, she can't help but amaze me
The way that she dances, ain't afraid to take chances
And wears her heart on her sleeve
Yeah, she's crazy, she's crazy, she's crazy
But her crazy's beautiful to me
Her crazy's beautiful to me

[Verse 1]
Sunday morning
Man, she woke up fightin' mad
Bitchin' and moanin' on and on
'Bout the time I had
And by Tuesday you could say
That girl was good as gone
Then when Thursday came around I was all alone
So I went for a drive to clear my mind
Ended up at a Shell on I-65

[Chorus 1]
Then I won a hundred bucks on a scratch-off ticket
I bought two 12-packs and a tank of gas with it
She swore they were a waste of time
Oh, but she was wrong
I was caller number five on a radio station
Won a four day, three night beach vacation
Deep sea señorita fishing down in Panama
And I ain't gotta see my
Ex-future-mother-in-law anymore
Oh Lord, when it rains it pours

[Verse 2]
Now she was sure real quick to up and apologize
When she heard about my newfound luck
On that FM dial
And it's crazy how lately now
It just seems to come in waves
What I thought was gonna be the death of me
Was my saving grace
It's got me thinking that her leaving
Is the only logical reason

[Chorus 2]
That I got the last spot in the Hooters' parking lot
And the waitress left her number on my check with a heart
She picked up on the first ring when I gave her a call
And I only spent five bucks at the Moose Club raffle
Won a used 4-wheeler and three free passes
For me and two of my buddies to play a round of golf
And I ain't gotta see my
Ex-future-mother-in-law anymore
Oh Lord, when it rains it pours
When it rains it pours

[Bridge]
Well I've been on one hell of a redneck roll
For three weeks now
And it all started on the day that she walked out

[Chorus 1]
Then I won a hundred bucks on a scratch-off ticket
Bought two 12-packs and a tank of gas with it
She swore they were a waste of time
Oh, but she was wrong
And I was caller number five on a radio station
Won a four day, three night beach vacation
Deep sea señorita fishing down in Panama
And I ain't gotta see my
Ex-future-mother-in-law anymore
Oh Lord, when it rains it pours
When it rains it pours

[Verse 1]
Oh, maybe I came on too strong
Maybe I waited too long
Maybe I played my cards wrong
Oh, just a little bit wrong
Baby I apologize for it

[Pre-Chorus]
I could fall, or I could fly
Here in your aeroplane
And I could live, I could die
Hangin' on the words you say
And I've been known to give my all
And jumpin' in harder than
Ten thousand rocks on the lake

[Chorus]
So don't call me baby
Unless you mean it
Don't tell me you need me
If you don't believe it
So let me know the truth
Before I dive right into you

[Verse 2]
You're a mystery
I have travelled the world
And there's no other girl like you
No one, what's your history? (What's your history?)
Do you have a tendency to lead some people on?
'Cause I heard you do, mmh

[Pre-Chorus]
I could fall, or I could fly
Here in your aeroplane
And I could live, I could die
Hanging on the words you say
And I've been known to give my all
And lie awake, every day
Don't know how much I can take

[Chorus]
So don't call me baby
Unless you mean it
Don't tell me you need me
If you don't believe it
So let me know the truth
Before I dive right into you

[Bridge]
I could fall, or I could fly
Here in your aeroplane
And I could live, I could die
Hangin' on the words you say
And I've been known to give my all
Sittin' back, lookin' at
Every mess that I made

[Chorus]
So don't call me baby
Unless you mean it
Don't tell me you need me
If you don't believe it
So let me know the truth
Before I dive right into you
Before I dive right into you
Before I dive right into you

[Verse 1]
Seventeen, you don't think that much about life
You just live it
Like kerosene dancing around a fire
But you're in it

[Pre-Chorus]
So you jump right in
Ain't afraid to fall
And you give it all

[Chorus]
She got the best of me
She broke my heart
Now all that's left of me
Is beating in this guitar
Every night, a different town
She follows me around
So you get what's left of me
Yeah, you get what's left of me
'Cause she got the best of me

[Verse 2]
I picked myself up off the floor
And found something new worth living for
And a, old dusty hand-me-down six string
And a couple chords

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm getting over her
A little more with every song
So sing along

[Chorus]
She got the best of me
She broke my heart
Now all that's left of me
Is beating in this guitar
Every night, a different town
She follows me around
So you get what's left of me
Yeah, you get what's left of me
'Cause she got the best of me

[Chorus]
She got the best of me
She broke my heart
Now all that's left of me
Is beating in this guitar
Every night, a different town
She follows me around
So you get what's left of me
Yeah, you get what's left of me
'Cause she got the best of me

[Outro]
She got the best of me
She got the best of me
She got the best of me

[Verse 1]
Are you sitting at home, all alone, trying to fall asleep?
Are you staring a hole through your phone, praying that it rings?
Are you watching a movie that you've seen a thousand times?
Or maybe playing some Mayer, getting lost in your favorite lines

[Pre-Chorus]
Well, if you're anything like me
You just might be doing whatever it takes
To drown out the noise
But I just wanna hear your voice

[Chorus]
I’m one number away
From calling to you
I said I was through
But I'm dying, inside
Got my head in a mess
Girl, I confess
I lied when I said
"I'm leaving and not coming back"
Might be the whiskey or the midnight rain
But everywhere I go, I see your face
In my brain, dial it up, everything I wanna say
But I'm still one number away

[Verse 2]
Are you stuck at a red light with a Marlboro Light on your lips?
Does the smoke in your mirror get clearer without my kiss?
Are you changing the station replacing our favorite songs?
Well maybe it's a mistake, hit the brakes on the moving on

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Well, if you're anything like me
You just might be doing whatever it takes
To outrun the storm
But I'm almost out that door

[Chorus]
And I'm one number away
From calling to you
I said I was through
But I'm dying, inside
Got my head in a mess
Girl, I confess
I lied when I said
"I'm leaving and not coming back"
Might be the whiskey or the midnight rain
But everywhere I go, I see your face
In my brain, dial it up, everything I wanna say
But I'm still one number away

[Bridge]
Will you pick up when I call?
Or just forget we loved at all
We don't have to talk
I just wanna hear your voice

[Chorus]
And I'm one number away
From calling you
I said I was through
But I'm dying, inside
Got my head in a mess
Girl, I confess
I lied when I said
"I'm leaving and not coming back"
Might be the whiskey or the midnight rain
But everywhere I go, I see your face
In my brain, dial it up, everything I wanna say
But I'm still one number away

[Outro]
Away, away
Yeah I'm still one number away

[Verse 1]
You were wearing that black dress
Coat, and cowboy boots
He was there, but I didn't care
I was too busy staring at you
In the pouring rain, with the blue lights flashin'
In the hills of Appalachian
Close to tears with your makeup smeared
I asked you what had happened

[Chorus]
But I know she ain't ready
She won't be for awhile
And he broke her down
And when I'm around
I can see it in her smile
She's fightin' getting closer
It's just too plain to see
And I know she ain't ready
But that's alright with me

[Verse 2]
You were wearing that red dress
Pearls, and those high heels
Liked the way it made you look
You love the way it made you feel
So I said to you
"I'd sure love to do this again"
And you said
"Me too, but I'm just not over him"

[Chorus]
And I know she ain't ready
She won't be for awhile
And he broke her down
And when I'm around
I can see it in her smile
She's fightin' getting closer
It's just too plain to see
And I know she ain't ready
But that's alright with me, yeah

[Bridge]
She started calling me baby, and two years later
I was down on one knee
With a ring in hand, I said
"I'm your man, and girl, will you marry me?"

[Chorus 2]
She said, "You know that I'm ready
And I have been for awhile
When the bells sound and you turn around
I'll be walking down the aisle
This will only bring us closer
It's just too plain to see
And I know that we're ready
So that's alright with me
That's alright with me"

[Verse 1]
Hadn't had a good time
Since you know when
Got talked into going out
With hopes you were staying in
I was feeling like myself for the first time
In a long time
'Til I bumped into some of your friends
Over there talkin' to mine

[Chorus]
Then you rolled in with your hair in the wind
Baby, without warning
I was doing alright but just your sight
Had my heart stormin’
The moon went hidin’, stars quit shinin’
Rain was drivin’, thunder n' lightning
You wrecked my whole world when you came
And hit me like a hurricane
You hit me like a hurricane

[Verse 2]
Knew it was gonna be a long night
From the moment when
We locked eyes over whiskey on ice
Started talking 'bout us again
If I would've just laid my drink down
And walked out
I wouldn't be in my truck
Driving us to your house

[Chorus]
But you rolled in with your hair in the wind
Baby, without warning
I was doing alright but just your sight
Had my heart stormin’
The moon went hidin’, stars quit shinin’
Rain was drivin’, thunder n' lightning
You wrecked my whole world when you came
And hit me like a hurricane
You hit me like a hurricane

[Bridge]
Yeah, you hit me Category 5
With your smile
Blew me away
And girl, it ain't but midnight
You done killed the lights
Bent my heart back to your bedside

[Chorus]
Then you rolled in with your hair in the wind
Baby, without warning
'Cause I was doing alright but just your sight
Had my heart storming
The moon went hidin’, stars quit shinin’
Rain was drivin’, thunder n' lightning
You wrecked my whole world when you came
And hit me like a hurricane
You hit me like a hurricane
You hit me like a hurricane

[Verse 1]
A 40 HP Johnson on a flat bottom metal boat
Coke cans and BB guns, barbed wire and old fence posts
8-point bucks in autumn and freshly cut cornfields
One arm out the window and one hand on the wheel

[Chorus]
Some things just go better together and probably always will
Like a cup of coffee and a sunrise, Sunday drives and time to kill
What's the point of this ol' guitar if it ain't got no strings?
Or pourin' your heart into a song that you ain't gonna sing?
It's a match made up in heaven, like good ol' boys and beer
And me, as long as you're right here

[Verse 2]
Your license in my wallet when we go out downtown
Your lipstick's stained every coffee cup that I got in this house
The way you say, "I love you, too" is like rain on an old tin roof
And your hand fits right into mine like a needle in a groove

[Chorus]
Some things just go better together and probably always will
Like a cup of coffee and a sunrise, Sunday drives and time to kill
What's the point of this ol' guitar if it ain't got no strings?
Or pourin' your heart into a song that you ain't gonna sing?
It's a match made up in heaven, like good ol' boys and beer
And me, as long as you're right here

[Bridge]
Sometimes we're oil and water, but I wouldn't have it any other way
And if I'm being honest, your first and my last name

[Chorus]
Would just sound better together and probably always will
Like a cup of coffee and a sunrise, Sunday drives and time to kill
What's the point of this ol' guitar if it ain't got no strings?
Or pourin' your heart into a song that you ain't gonna sing?
It's a match made up in heaven, like good ol' boys and beer
And me, as long as you're right here
And me, as long as you're right here

[Verse 1]
Daddy, I'm afraid, won't you stay a little while?
Keep me safe 'cause there's monsters right outside
Daddy, please don't go, I don't wanna be alone
'Cause the second that you're gone they're gonna know
Before he went to bed he grabbed my hand and said

[Chorus]
Just 'cause I'm leavin'
It don't mean that I won't be right by your side
When you need me
And you can't see me in the middle of the night
Just close your eyes and say a prayer
It's okay, I know you're scared when I'm not here
But I'll always be right there
Even though I'm leavin', I ain't goin' nowhere

[Verse 2]
Dad, we'll be late, and Uncle Sam don't like to wait
He's got a big old plane that's gonna take me far away
I know I act tough, but there's a churnin' in my gut
'Cause I just can't call you up when things get rough
Before I left, he hugged my neck and said

[Chorus]
Just 'cause you're leavin'
It don't mean that I won't be right by your side
When you need me
And you can't see me in the middle of the night
Just close your eyes and say a prayer
It's okay, I know you're scared I might be here
But I'll always be right there
Even though you're leavin', I ain't goin' nowhere

[Bridge]
Daddy, I'm afraid, won't you stay a little while?
I never thought I'd see the day I had to say goodbye
Daddy, please don't go, I can't do this on my own
There's no way that I can walk this road alone
Daddy grabbed my hand and said

[Chorus]
Just 'cause I'm leavin'
It don't mean that I won't be right by your side
When you need me
And you can't see me in the middle of the night
Just close your eyes and say a prayer
It's okay, boy, I ain't scared
I won't be here, but I'll always be right there
Even though I'm leavin', I ain't goin' nowhere
I ain't goin' nowhere

[Verse 1]
Just pick yourself up, dust yourself off, they say it ain't that hard
But just puttin' one foot in front of the other ain't gettin' me too far
This movin' on ain't comin' along the way they said it would

[Chorus]
I guess whoever said "the grass is greener" must've never seen the other side
And "what don't kill you makes you stronger" sure sounds like a lie
And whoever said that "time heals everything and everything will be alright"
Whoever said "it ain't the end of the world and you'll find somebody new”
Must've never met you

[Verse 2]
Must've never heard you say you'd never leave me then watch you walk away
Must've never fell as hard as I did 'cause then they wouldn't say
"Maybe it wasn't meant to be, yeah maybe you're better off alone"

[Chorus]
I guess whoever said "the grass is greener" must've never seen the other side
And "what don't kill you makes you stronger" sure sounds like a lie
And whoever said that "time heals everything and everything will be alright"
Whoever said "it ain't the end of the world and you'll find somebody new"
Must've never met you
Must've never met you

[Bridge]
"Maybe it wasn't meant to be, yeah maybe you're better off alone"

[Chorus]
I guess whoever said "the grass is greener"
Must've never seen the other side
"What don't kill you makes you stronger"
Still sounds like a lie
And whoever said that "time heals everything and everything will be alright"
Whoever said "it ain't the end of the world, you know she ain't the only girl"
"You win, you lose, you find somebody new"
Must've never met you
Must've never met you

[Verse 1]
Back in the day it was a six gun, and a six-string
Man, that was country
And that's the way country still ought to be
It was lived, not taught, it was earned, not bought
Had to put in the work to get to the top
Let me tell you, what I thinks really gone wrong

[Pre-Chorus]
These days it's all wannabes singing someone else's songs
Everybody's doing the same damn thing
Where have the rebels gone?

[Chorus]
'Cause we don't need
Another pretty boy, singin' pretty songs
Fake country boys, doin' country all wrong
Need another Haggard, or a Johnny Cash
Somebody chewing tobacco, and whipping ass
I need preacher, I need a savior
How about y'all?
Can I get an outlaw?

[Verse 2]
It don't have to be honkytonks, boots, and Wrangler jeans
It ain't the banjo or the fiddle, no
It's the words and what they mean
If you gonna talk the talk, you better walk the walk
And brother, that's the truth
So honestly, what would Waylon do?

[Pre-Chorus]
I can guarantee that if he was alive today
He'd ask us one more time
"Are you sure Hank done it this way?"

[Chorus]
'Cause we don't need
Another pretty boy, singin' pretty songs
Fake country boys, doin' country all wrong
Need another Haggard, or a Johnny Cash
Somebody chewin' tobacco, and whippin' ass
I need preacher, I need a savior, how 'bout y'all?
Can I get an outlaw?

[Bridge]
Are the good times really gone for good?
Or can we get back to our roots?
It's about that time we raise the bar
So raise a glass if you feel like I do

[Chorus]
'Cause we don't need
Another pretty boy, singing pretty songs
Fake country boys, doin' country all wrong
Need another Haggard, or a Johnny Cash
Somebody chewin' tobacco, and whippin' ass
I need preacher, I need a savior, how 'bout y'all?
Can I get an outlaw?

[Outro]
I pray country answers my call
Can I get an outlaw?
Oh, can I get an outlaw?

[Verse 1]
That old phone of mine, 2:39
A.M. when I got the call
Half asleep
Thought it was a dream
But it wasn’t after all
That old dog of yours
Sitting on the porch
Waits for you to come home
Little does he know
That you won’t
Be walking through that door

[Pre-Chorus]
I just leave him alone
Cause letting go don’t come that easily
Most of the time, I can get by
It’s just a little hard on me

[Chorus]
But I’m getting used to that old truck of yours
Sitting out in the drive
I’m getting used to you not being there
At church on Sunday night
I’m getting used to the radio playing
Without you singing along
But I’ll never get used to you being gone

[Verse 2]
That old rocking chair
Sitting over there
It don’t rock no more
And that old six string
Ain't played a thing
Been awhile since it’s hummed a chord

[Pre-Chorus]
I just leave 'em alone cause letting go
Don’t come that easily
Most of the time
I can get by
It’s just a little hard on me

[Chorus]
But I’m getting used to that old truck of yours
Sitting out in the drive
I’m getting used to you not being there
At church on Sunday night
I’m getting used to the radio playing
Without you singing along
But I’ll never get used to you being gone

[Bridge]
There’s a lot of things in this 'ole world I can stand
But when it comes to losing you
I just can’t

[Chorus 2]
Yeah, I’m getting used to that old truck of yours
Sitting out in the drive
I’m getting used to you not being there
At church on Sunday night
I’m getting used to the radio playing
Without you singing along
But I'll never get used to
No, I’ll never get used to you being gone

[Outro]
Yeah, being gone
I’m never getting used to you being gone

[Verse 1]
This is my kinda town, this is my kinda place
I wouldn't mind hangin' 'round for more than just a couple days
I got a 12th floor room with a killer view of the empty Astrodome
Got a tab at the bar downstairs, but all I can think about is home

[Chorus]
I got my new boots covered in red dirt, a "Don't Mess With Texas" t-shirt
And a Lonestar postcard postmarked with "missin' you"
It's got the biggest sky you've ever seen, the coldest beer you'd ever drink
But I still feel like I landed on the moon, 'cause it ain't got you
Houston, we got a problem

[Verse 2]
You should've seen 19th Street, you should've seen a midnight rodeo
The way them saloon doors swing, when they line dance to "Copperhead Road"
Something about the air down here, that'll make you feel the way all them cowboys do
I wish I was an outlaw, but all I can think about is you

[Chorus]
I got my new boots covered in red dirt, a "Don't Mess With Texas" t-shirt
And a Lonestar postcard postmarked with "missin' you"
It's got the biggest sky you've ever seen, the coldest beer you'd ever drink
But I still feel like I landed on the moon, 'cause it ain't got you
Houston, we got a problem

[Outro]
It's got the biggest sky you've ever seen, the coldest beer you'd ever drink
But I still feel like I landed on the moon, 'cause it ain't got you
Houston, we got a problem
Houston we got a problem
Houston we got a problem

[Verse 1]
There’s a couple people that I owe a beer or two
And three or four I owe more than a few
For all the times I couldn’t find the answers
Stumbling through the dark without a clue
This one’s for you

[Verse 2]
Mom and daddy always did their best
For a crazy fool who couldn’t help himself
I thank God they were there to see me through
This one’s for you

[Chorus]
I told you all I’d write you a song (Song, song, song)
Pour my heart in the melody
To keep you singing along (Singing along, singing along)
This might not be the right time
These might not be the right lines to prove
For sayin' what I’m tryin' to
But this one’s for you

[Verse 3]
I’ve been knocked down time and time again
Got picked back up by love and few good friends
Who reminded me of all I stood to lose
This one’s for you

[Chorus]
Yeah I told you all I’d write you a song (Song, song)
Pour my heart in the melody
To keep you singing along (Singing along, singing along)
This might not be the right time
These might not be the right lines to prove
For sayin' what I’m tryin' to
This one’s for you

(Oh, yee-eeah)
Uuu-uuu-uuu-uu-uu

[Bridge]
Made more than my fair share of the same mistakes
Bridges burned and lessons learned
A few things that I can’t change
Some apologies are way past overdue
So this one’s for you

[Chorus]
Wow, I told you all I’d write you a song (Song, song)
Pour my heart in the melody
To keep you singing along (Singing along, singing along)
This might not be the right time (Time, time)
And these might not be the right lines to prove (To prove)
For saying what I’m trying to
This one’s for you

[Outro]
There’s a couple people that I owe a beer or two
And three or four I owe more than a few

[Verse 1]
Honey, how's that drink goin' down
Seems a little stiff for 2 P.M
Holler if you need anything
I've got an ear to lend
I'll be right here cuttin' lines
Countin' cash and stockin' beers
I've got an idea what's on your mind
So in the meantime, think on this

[Chorus]
I've seen girls like you in here before
Watched broken hearts break
Though that door a time or two
And I'll bet he packed all his things
You set out to curse his name and have a few
And I'll bet you're doin' your best to move on
Well, you're not the only lonely one

[Verse 2]
This ain't my first rodeo
I've seen the other side of this bar
Pourin' salts on an open wound
Sittin' right there where you are
And I know it probably stings right now
Somehow more than that Jim Bean
But that clock on the wall will cure it all
Even though that ain't how it seems

[Chorus]
I've seen girls like you in here before
Watched broken hearts break
Though that door a time or two
And I'll bet he packed all his things
You set out to curse his name and have a few
And I'll bet you're doin' your best to move on
Well, you're not the only lonely one

[Bridge]
I've seen 'em come, I've seen 'em go
Girl, you ain't in this thing alone
Oh no, oh no

[Chorus]
I've seen girls like you in here before
Watched broken hearts break
Though that door a time or two
And I'll bet he packed all his things
You set out to curse his name and have a few
And I'll bet you're doin' your best to move on
Well, you're not the only lonely one
No, you're not the only lonely one

[Verse 1]
Dear Today, Tomorrow here
Man, I was just checkin' in, hope you've been well
Me? I'm doin' alright, could always be better
Seein' as you're the only one with a choice in the matter
If I know you, hell, you're too busy
To do damn near anything that you ought to
Guess what I'm sayin' is, is if you don't change
Boy, you'll be kickin' yourself one of these days

[Chorus]
So maybe you should call our mama and have a drink with our old man
Quit wastin' our sweet time and put that diamond on her hand
Stop takin' me for granted like I'll always be around
'Cause even as you read this, boy, that clock is tickin' down
And remember every second I got's borrowed
So I hope you think of me today
Sincerely, Tomorrow

[Verse 2]
Listen, I ain't tryin' to bring you down
'Cause I know damn better than pushin' you around
I guess I was just lookin' out for you and me both
'Cause we both lose if I told you so

[Chorus]
So maybe you should call our mama and have a drink with our old man
Quit wastin' our sweet time and put that diamond on her hand
Stop takin' me for granted like I'll always be around
'Cause even as you read this, boy, that clock is tickin' down
And remember every second I got's borrowed
So I hope you think of me today
Sincerely, Tomorrow

[Instrumental Break]

[Outro]
Dear Today, Tomorrow here
Man, I was just checkin' in, hope you been well

[Verse 1]
Well I got caught in Panama City
Tryin' to buy some beer for some Georgia girls
And I got wore out by my daddy
For stealin' cigarettes from the Smokes and More
And all my friends would get away
Seems I'd get caught, plain as day
I took the blame for every little thing

[Chorus]
But I got away with you
And somehow l still ain't been found out
It's a crazy truth
Like l strolled out the gates of Alcatraz
And l walked in the Louvre
Now the Mona Lisa's hanging in my house
I bust out of Buckingham with the crown jewels
And l got away with you

[Verse 2]
Well lookin' like you do
On its damn own, should be a crime
Let alone a fool like me
Hand in hand with you, should be doin' time
But here we are runnin' free
Guess someone turned the other cheek
'Cause there ain't no blue lights in the rear view

[Chorus]
Guess I got away with you
And somehow l still ain't been found out
It's a crazy truth
Like l strolled out the gates of Alcatraz
And l walked in the Louvre
Now the Mona Lisa's hanging in my house
I bust out of Buckingham with the crown jewels
And l got away with you

[Bridge]
I'll take it all, the fails, the falls
The county jails and one phone calls
I'd do it all again if I had to

[Chorus]
'Cause I got away with you
Somehow girl, I still ain't been found out
It's a crazy truth
Like l strolled out the gates of Alcatraz
And l walked in the Louvre
Now the Mona Lisa's hanging in my house
I bust out of Buckingham with the crown jewels
And l got away with you
When l got away with you
Yeah, I got away with you

[Verse 1]
Six beers and five guys and if I remember right, it was a
Wednesday when we got our buzz on for second hand six pack
Half smoked soft pack, light it up boys, take a drag
And when I fought that cough off everyone else thought I was so damn cool

[Pre-Chorus]
But my head was spinnin' like a Tilt-A-Whirl
Yeah man, it really rocked my world

[Chorus]
Back when everything seemed just a little bit stronger
Back when the weekend lasted a little longer
I can't tell you why they did, but things seemed to never end back then
Oh way back when, when a little went a long way

[Verse 2]
One girl, 45 bucks was all it took that night
Hit the steakhouse makeout and the movies way up in the back
Credits roll on pace,to make it all the way to second base
Tried to play it cool like it was nothin' new and she didn't have a clue

[Pre-Chorus]
But my head was spinnin' like a Tilt-A-Whirl
Yeah man, she really rocked my world

[Chorus]
Back when things seemed just a little bit stronger
Back when the weekend lasted a little longer
I can't tell you why they did, things seemed to never end back then
Oh way back when, when a little went a long way

[Chorus]
Back when everything seemed just a little bit stronger
Back when the weekend lasted a little longer
I can't tell you why they did, but things seemed to never end back then
Oh way back when, when a little went a long long way
A long way

[Verse 1]
It's been a long night with a heavy load
And now my high beams are shinin' on my babies road
Gonna pick up some clay on the tread of these tires
Have ourselves a hell of a night
Look up in that Carolina sky

[Chorus]
Let that moonshine, all night, take your breath away
Like an old sweet song daddy used to play
And it takes me back to a simpler place and time
When we used to kick back
And let the moonshine
So let the moonshine

[Verse 2]
It's been a long time since we felt that creek
Runnin' cold and clear over our bare feet
Baby, you don't know that this right here
Is the same water my ol' man used in his still
I still remember what he used to say

[Chorus]
Let that moonshine, all night, take your breath away
Like an old sweet song daddy used to play
And it takes me back to a simpler place and time
When we used to kick back
And let the moonshine
So let the moonshine

[Bridge]
It burns me up and lights a fire in my soul
We'll get you a sip and let the whiskey take control

[Chorus]
Let that moonshine, all night, take your breath away
Like an old sweet song daddy used to play
And it takes me back to a simpler place and time
When we used to kick back
And let the moonshine
Just let the moonshine
And let the moonshine

[Verse 1]
Well me and my buddies went sneakin' out
About 2AM to catch us some trout
That's when I saw that car pull up
He said boys I don't care that you're way out here
But you look a little young for all that beer
And when he got close, I couldn't tell who that was
He said I ain't the cops, I ain't your parents
Boys you're dealin' with the county sheriff

[Chorus]
So I said we can share if you want to
So buddy won't you?
Take a sip and help us finish shit tonight
I ain't givin' you an attitude
But I can tell you're in a bad mood
Just a little bit will have you feelin' just right
So dude, we can share if you want to

[Verse 2]
Me and my boys sneakin' out again
A quick turnaround it was the next weekend
We had the single cab all filled up with smoke
He came up quick and tapped on the glass
I dropped that joint and sat up real fast
And when I saw who it was, damn I almost choked
Well it wasn't the cops, it wasn't our parents
It was our old friend the county sheriff

[Chorus]
So I said we can share if you want to
So buddy won't you?
Take a hit and help us finish shit tonight
I ain't givin' you an attitude
But I can tell you're in a bad mood
Just a little bit will have you feelin' just right
So dude, we can share if you want to

[Bridge]
Well we got off both times, even though we crossed that line
And you can too, 'cause all you have to do is say

[Chorus]
We can share if you want to
So buddy won't you?
Take a hit and help us finish shit tonight
I ain't givin' you an attitude
But I can tell you're in a bad mood
Just a little bit will have you feelin' just right
So dude, we can share if you want to

[Outro]
We can share if you want to

[Verse 1]
I don't know why you can't buy wine 'round here on Sunday
Or an ice-cold beer at a college football game
I don't know why at eighteen, mama gave me a curfew
But it was, "Son, you're under my roof, then you're under my rules"

[Pre-Chorus]
I guess it's all a part of a bigger plan
But some of them I'll never understand

[Chorus]
But they got their reasons, just like you
When you walked out of my life when you didn't have to
You send me reelin', there's nothin' I can do
About you takin' my heart and breakin' it right in two
So if you see me soakin' in these thoughts I'm thinkin'
Drownin' in some barroom off the deep end
I got my reasons

[Verse 2]
I don't know why them uptown guys sittin' three seats from me
Are raisin' 'em up just as fast as they can put 'em down
Or why that old timer wants the Yankees on the TV
And the barkeep keeps buyin' that one girl free rounds

[Chorus]
But they got their reasons, just like you
When you walked out of my life when you didn't have to
You send me reelin', there's nothin' I can do
About you takin' my heart and breakin' it right in two
So if you see me soakin' in these thoughts I'm thinkin'
Drownin' in some barroom off the deep end
I got my reasons

[Bridge]
Some are good and some are bad
Some are true and some are sad
Everyone's got some but I need one
That brings you back

[Chorus]
We all got our reasons, just like you
When you walked out of my life and you didn't have to
You send me reelin', there's nothin' I can do
About you takin' my heart and breakin' it right in two
So if you see me soakin' in these thoughts I'm thinkin'
Drownin' in some barroom off the deep end
I got my reasons

[Outro]
Woah, I got my reasons
Yeah, I got my reasons

[Verse 1]
Couldn't wait to ride out of that one horse town
Didn't see no use in sticking around
I was green and busting at the seams to leave
I was sitting on G, waiting on O
The day I hit eighteen, I hit the road
Traded that county maintain for a four lane city street

[Pre-Chorus]
But sometimes things ain't what you think they're gonna be
What you want ain't always what you need

[Chorus]
Don't know what you got 'til it's gone
And you're out on your own
All you want is what you can't get back
Once you let it go, then you know what you have
Don't hold a candle to what you had
Sometimes what you think you'll find
It ain't quite what real life has in store
So be careful what you wish for

[Verse 2]
She was holding on just a little too tight
Talked a little too much about the rest of our lives
I broke her heart thinking freedom would set me free
Well sometimes things ain't what you think they're gonna be

[Chorus]
Don't know what you got 'til it's gone
And you're out on your own
All you want is what you can't get back
Once you let it go, then you know what you have
Don't hold a candle to what you had
Sometimes what you think you'll find
It ain't quite what real life has in store
So be careful what you wish for

[Bridge]
'Cause these city lights can't shine quite like the stars
I wish I could wish her back into my arms

[Chorus]
Don't know what you got 'til it's gone
And you're out on your own
All you want is what you can't get back
Once you let it go, then you know what you have
Don't hold a candle to what you had
Sometimes what you think you'll find
It ain't quite what real life has in store
And you can't get her back no more
So be careful what you wish for
Be careful what you wish for

[Verse 1]
Don't get me wrong
I like a bobber on the water
Hookin' 'em and reelin' 'em in
I like a Friday night slow ride
Brooks & Dunn B-side
Hit rewind, spin it again
I like a strong shot of whiskey
The way a Marlboro hits me
Some broken in cowboy boots

[Chorus]
But I'm in love and lovin' on you
I feel that rush soon as you walk in a room
I can't get enough of you, honey
You're right on the money
I'm a junkie for your midnight moves
I'm in love and lovin' on you

[Verse 2]
I like a sunrise, duck blind
Birdie on a par 5
Miller Lite before noon
I like a two-door old Ford
Wood board back porch
Three chords and the truth

[Chorus]
But I'm in love and lovin' on you
I feel that rush soon as you walk in a room
I can't get enough of you, honey
You're right on the money
I'm a junkie for your midnight moves
I'm in love with lovin' on you

[Chorus]
Girl, I'm in love and lovin' on you
I feel that rush soon as you walk in a room
I can't get enough of you, honey
You're right on the money
I'm a junkie for your midnight moves
I'm in love and lovin' on you
I'm in love and lovin' on you

[Verse 1]
Screamed into the driveway, with my foot stuck on the gas
Had the Crown mixed up in a Dixie cup, when she hopped into the cab
She said "Boy what you got in store, what we getting into tonight?"
Hell, I don't care, It ain't here nor there, just as long as you're by my side

[Chorus]
Whether she's sitting shotgun with her hair done
Or with the seats leaned back and the radio on
On the backstreets, in the backseat
Those baby blue eyes staring back at me
Whether it's in park or it's in drive
I love the way she rides

[Verse 2]
So we hit that ground a running, throwing caution to the wind
And it wasn't long before that drink was gone, and she was shakin' that ass again
She said find somewhere dark where we can park, and put a hurtin' on this bottle
So we said goodnight to the city lights, kicking it in full throttle

[Chorus]
Whether she's sitting shotgun with her hair done
Or with the seats leaned back and the radio on
On the backstreets, in the backseat
Those baby blue eyes staring back at me
Whether it's in park or it's in drive
I love the way she rides

[Chorus]
Whether she's sitting shotgun with her hair done
Or with the seats leaned back and the radio on
On the backstreets, in the backseat
Those baby blue eyes staring back at me
Whether it's in park or it's in drive
I love the way she rides
The way she rides
The way she rides, yeah, yeah
The way she rides

[Verse 1]
I've had a largemouth bass bust my line
A couple beautiful girls tell me goodbye
Trucks break down, dogs run off
Politicians lie, been fired by the boss

[Pre-Chorus]
It takes one hand
To count the things I can count on
No, there ain't much, man
That ain't never let me down

[Chorus]
Longneck ice-cold beer never broke my heart
Like diamond rings and football teams have torn this boy apart
Like a neon dream, it just dawned on me that bars and this guitar
And longneck ice-cold beer never broke my heart

[Verse 2]
She was a Carolina blue jean baby
Fire in her eyes that drove me crazy
It was red taillights when she left town
If I didn't know then, I sure know now

[Chorus]
But longneck ice-cold beer never broke my heart
Like diamond rings and football teams have torn this boy apart
Like a neon dream, it just dawned on me that bars and this guitar
And longneck ice-cold beer never broke my heart, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
Well, it takes one hand
To count the things I can count on
But I got one hand
That's grippin' down on a cold one

[Chorus]
'Cause longneck ice-cold beer never broke my heart
Like diamond rings and football teams have torn this boy apart
Like a neon dream, it just dawned on me, that bars, and this guitar
And longneck ice-cold beer never broke my heart, no
It never broke my heart

[Verse 1]
I can still see your blue sky blue eyes hangin' on a mango kiss
Hear the waves and the breeze and the Joshua trees
Was just about as good as it gets
Taste the salt on the rim, feel the sand on your skin
And the wild in the wind like I'm right there again

[Chorus]
Under a moon over Mexico
Holdin' onto you as the low tide rolls
Whatever that buzz was, I ain't felt it since
But I can't seem to let it go
And there was a shine in the dark, a flame from a spark
And a lime in a Pacifico
Under a moon over Mexico

[Verse 2]
The second I left I was kickin' myself
'Cause I knew I should've stayed
Still tequila love drunk, from us wakin' up
Under the Cabo palm leaf shade
And it's crazy I know, but I'd give anything to go
To you and me on that coast, in the midnight glow

[Chorus]
Of a moon over Mexico
Holdin' onto you as the low tide rolls
Whatever that buzz was, I ain't felt it since
But I can't seem to let it go
And there was a shine in the dark, a flame from a spark
And a lime in a Pacifico
Under a moon over Mexico

[Bridge]
Taste the salt on the rim, feel the sand on your skin
And the wild in the wind, like I'm right there again

[Chorus]
Under a moon over Mexico
Holdin' onto you as the low tide rolls
Whatever that buzz was, I ain't felt it since
But I can't seem to let it go
And there was a shine in the dark, a flame from a spark
And a lime in a Pacifico
Under a moon over Mexico
Under a moon over Mexico
Over Mexico

[Verse 1: Luke Combs]
Well I got a call from Rowdy ‘round six o'clock
Sayin' he caught a hankerin’ for a honky tonk
Wants an ice cold beer and a country song
But he didn't want to stay out all night long
Well I ain't the kind to let a buddy drink alone
But I can't turn it off once I turn it on

[Chorus: Luke Combs]
There's no stoppin' me once I get goin'
Put a can in my hand man, I'm wide ass open
The tick-tock of that clock is like a time bomb
By half past 10 I'm half past tipsy
And quarter to 12, man I done had plenty
The countdowns on when the first beer hits me
5-4-3-2-1 too many

[Verse 2: Luke Combs]
After five diet Millers I was feelin' loose
Singin' karaoke to a TL tune
When a pretty little thing shot me a wink
She said, "Hey cowboy, could you buy us a drink?"
Well hey, baby doll, I will if you want
But I can't turn it off once I turn it on

[Chorus: Luke Combs]
There's no stoppin' me once I get goin'
Put a can in my hand man, I'm wide ass open
The tick-tock of that clock is like a time bomb
By half past 10 I'm half past tipsy
And quarter to 12, man I done had plenty
The countdowns on when the first beer hits me
5-4-3-2-1 too many

[Bridge: Luke Combs, Brooks & Dunn]
C'mon
Now I've never been the kind to quit
Won't stop 'til I get to the bottom of this
And the night's still young so whatcha say we shotgun one?
Hell we'll shoot one with you Luke, come on Ronnie

[Chorus: Brooks & Dunn, Luke Combs]
There's no stoppin' me once I get to goin'
Put a can in my hand man, I'm wide ass open
The tick-tock of that clock is like a time bomb
About half past 10 I'm half past tipsy
And quarter to 12, man, I done had plenty
The countdowns on when the first beer hit me
5-4-3-2-1 too many
Yeah, 5-4-3-2-1 too many

[Outro]
Come on, that’s a ******* country song right there

[Verse 1]
Cheap boat, six pack of some' light
A fireball burning up a blue sky
Mercury '93, wasn't even half past noon
Our first taste of freedom after high school
Breaking hearts and curfews and mama’s rules
I just laugh thinking ’bout all the shit we got into
Yeah those were the days we thought we'd never lose

[Chorus]
But we did
And we miss
How it was when we were just kids
Looking back
On the past
Wasn’t much but it's what we had
Just a couple buds and a good buzz, that's all it was
But that's what memories are made of

[Verse 2]
Its been so long since me and Katie first met
We lost touch as all of the years went flying past, fading fast
Wishing I could make her mine
There's some things that seem to take you right back
I see her face every time I hear that
Lynyrd Skynyrd, bottle spin
I'm in her arms, in my mind
Yeah those were the days we thought we'd never lose (never lose)

[Chorus]
But we did
And we miss
How it was when we were just kids
Looking back
On the past
Wasn’t much but it's what we had
Just a good buzz, from a summer love was all it was
Yeah that's what memories are made of

[Bridge]
Yeah those were the days we thought we'd never lose

[Chorus]
But we did
And we miss
How it was when we were just kids
Looking back
On the past
Wasn’t much but it's what we had
Just a couple buds and a good buzz, that's all it was
Yeah a summer love was all it was
Yeah that's what memories are made of

[Verse 1]
I've been doing my best to make church on Sundays
And ain't been calling in hungover most Mondays
I guess you could say I'm being grown up
I got my shit together and oddly enough
I don't mind
'Cause it's about time
But if you second guessin', don't think for a second
That I can't hang

[Chorus]
'Cause I've been known to get a little bit of wild and reckless
Known to have a little bit of beer with breakfast
You can bet these boots have gotten pretty used to
Stomping on a hardwood floor
And buying the bar another round of shots
Close my tab and hit the parking lot
Next stop is a spot with a fridge stocked on the back porch
I ain't afraid to take too many steps out of line
So don't tempt me with a good time

[Verse 2]
Well most folks think I don't know how to throw down
They done forgot about rowdy
But no doubt he's still around
So keep cracking those jokes
'Cause I'm willing and able
Yeah, this old boy'll drink you under the table

[Chorus]
'Cause I've been known to get a little bit of wild and reckless
Known to have a little bit of beer with breakfast
You can bet these boots have gotten pretty used to
Stomping on a hardwood floor
And buying the bar another round of shots
Close my tab and hit the parking lot
Next stop is a spot with a fridge stocked on the back porch
I ain't afraid to take too many steps out of line
So don't tempt me with a good time

[Bridge]
At 3AM I'm still hanging tough
My buddy's passed out in the bed of my truck
And I can't wait 'til he wakes up
And sees the pictures on his phone

[Chorus]
'Cause I've been known to get a little bit of wild and reckless
Known to have a little bit of beer with breakfast
You can bet these boots have gotten pretty used to
Stomping on a hardwood floor
And buying the bar another round of shots
Close my tab and hit the parking lot
Next stop is a spot with a fridge stocked on the back porch
I ain't afraid to take too many steps out of line
So don't tempt me with a good time
With a good time

[Verse 1]
There's daddy on his John Deere, brand new in '96
Beside me and Bandit playing fetch when I was a kid
A Save the Date, best day of my best buddies life
Anybody else could walk on by, and not blink an eye

[Chorus]
'Cause they're just pictures hanging side by side
Forgotten memories from another time
Just the places that I've been before
Couple magnets, recipes, and Polaroids
Yeah, but that's my life on the 'frigerator door

[Verse 2]
My first day of kindergarten when I was 5 years old
A postcard that my cousin sent from Cancun, Mexico
A list of what Mama needs from the IGA today
Is just one small part of a work of art signed Kenmore in '98

[Chorus]
With all those pictures hanging side by side
Forgotten memories from another time
And all the places that I've been before
Couple magnets, recipes, and Polaroids
Yeah, but that's my life on the 'frigerator door

[Bridge]
As life flies by, it spills onto the side
Until it's covered top to bottom with the best days of your life

[Chorus]
And all those pictures hanging side by side
Forgotten memories from another time
And all the places that you've been before
Couple magnets, recipes, and Polaroids
Yeah, but that's our lives on the 'frigerator door
On the 'frigerator door

BFG’s coming ‘cross the creek
Z71, headlights shining through the trees
The boys spill out of the backseat
And ask me, what’s it gonna be tonight?

I said, I’m just trying to get loose, trying to make a move
Don’t matter what we do

As long we’re out there somewhere
Where we can go
Get away from it all, get lost
And God only knows
Where we’ll go
And hell, I don’t care
As long we’re out there

We pulled in, threw it in park
And followed the orange glow in the dark in the trail marks
Through the fire and flames, we locked eyes
She walked over from the other side and smiled
When I said

I’m just trying to get loose, trying to set the mood
Don’t matter what we do (Yeah, what we do)

As long as we‘re out there somewhere
Where we can go
Get away from it all, get lost
And God only knows
Where we'll go
And, baby I don’t care
As long we’re out there
As long we’re out there
Yeah

God only knows
As long as we're out there, somewhere
Where we can go
Get away from it all, get lost
And God only knows
Where we'll go
And, hell I don’t care
As long we’re out there
As long as we're out there, yeah

[Verse 1]
I’ve been working this job 9 – 5
Minimum wage and overtime
But here comes a few days of unpaid vacation
And there ain’t no way José I'll waste them
'Cause there ain’t no better feeling than when

[Chorus]
I pick up a beer can and get to feeling like superman
Its Friday night y'all, here's the plan
I'm gonna throw back a couple and
Keep 'em glued to my right hand
Any flavor, size, or brand
Until the point where I can’t stand
No nothing picks me up like a beer can

[Verse 2]
I woke up at I pm
And introduced myself to my new girlfriend
And there’s a wrecking ball sized hole in the wall in the basement
I ain't got no clue how or who could have made it
Well all I know is shit hit the fan
And here we go again

[Chorus]
I pick up a beer can and get to feeling like superman
Its Saturday y'all, here's the plan
I'm gonna throw back a couple and
Keep 'em glued to my right hand
Any flavor, size, or brand
Until the point where I can’t stand
No nothing picks me up like a beer can

[Bridge]
Well it's Sunday now and I'm freaking out
'Cause I can’t handle five days without

[Chorus]
Yeah, picking up a beer can and get to feeling like superman
It's Sunday, who gives a damn?
I'm gonna throw back a couple and
Keep 'em glued to my right hand
Any flavor, size, or brand
Until the point where I can’t stand
No nothing picks me up like a beer can

[Outro]
Like a beer can
No nothing picks me up like a beer can

[Verse 1]
You say you'll be down in five
The smell of your perfume is floating down the stairs
You're fixing up your hair like you do
I know that I'll be a mess
The second that I see you
You won't be surprised
It happens every time
It's nothin' new

[Pre-Chorus]
It's always on a night like tonight
I thank God you can read my mind
'Cause when you look at me with those eyes

[Chorus]
I'm speechless
Starin' at you standin' there in that dress
What it's doin' to me ain't a secret
'Cause watching you is all that I can do
And I'm speechless
You already know that you're my weakness
After all this time I'm just as nervous
Every time you walk into the room
I'm speechless

[Verse 2]
It started when you said hello
Just did something to me
And I've been in a daze
Ever since the day that we met
You take the breath out of my lungs
Can't even fight it
And all of the words, out of my mouth without even tryin'

[Chorus]
And I'm speechless
Starin' at you standin' there in that dress
What it's doin' to me ain't a secret
'Cause watching you is all that I can do
And I'm speechless
You already know that you're my weakness
After all this time I'm just as nervous
Every time you walk into the room
I'm speechless

[Bridge]
Yeah, baby, mmm
It's always on a night like tonight
I thank God you can read my mind
'Cause when you look at me with those eyes

[Chorus]
I'm speechless
You standin' there in that dress
Girl, it ain't a secret
'Cause watchin' you is all that I can do
Oh, I'm speechless
You already know that you're my weakness
After all this time I'm just as nervous
Every time you walk into the room
I'm speechless

[Outro]
Oh, you know it, baby
Mmm

[Verse 1]
I can still shut down a party
I can hang with anybody
I can drink whiskey and red wine
Champagne all night
Little Scotch on the rocks and I'm fine, I'm fine

[Chorus]
But when I taste tequila
Baby, I still see ya
Cuttin' up the floor in a sorority T-shirt
The same one you wore when we were
Sky high in Colorado, your lips pressed against the bottle
Swearing on a Bible, baby, I'd never leave ya
I remember how bad I need ya
When I taste tequila (When I, when I, when I)
When I taste tequila (When I, when I, when I)

[Verse 2]
I can kiss somebody brand new
And not even think about you
I can show up to the same bar
Hear the same songs in my car
Baby, your memory, it only hits me this hard

[Chorus]
When I taste tequila
Baby, I still see ya
Cuttin' up the floor in a sorority T-shirt
The same one you wore when we were
Sky high in Colorado, your lips pressed against the bottle
Swearing on a Bible, baby, I'd never leave ya
I remember how bad I need ya (Need ya)
When I taste tequila (When I, when I, when I)
When I taste tequila, oh (When I, when I, when I)

[Bridge]
I ain't even drunk, I ain't even drunk and I'm thinkin'
How I need your love, how I need your love, yeah, it sinks in

[Chorus]
When I taste tequila
Baby, I still see ya
Sorority T-shirt
The same one you wore when we were
Sky high in Colorado, your lips pressed against the bottle
Swearing on a Bible, baby, I'd never leave ya
I remember how bad I need ya (Need ya)
When I taste tequila (When I, when I, when I)
When I taste tequila, oh (When I, when I, when I)
When I taste tequila, oh (When I, when I, when I)
When I taste tequila (When I, when I, when I)
Ooh

[Verse 1: Dan & Shay]
Grandma and grandpa painted a picture
Of 65 years in one little house
More than a memory
More than saying I do
Kiss you goodnights
And I love you’s
Me and you baby
We’ll walk in their footsteps
We’ll build our own family
One day at a time
10 little toes
A painted pink room
Our beautiful baby looks just like you

[Chorus 1: Dan & Shay]
And we’ll build this love from the ground up
Now til forever it’s all of me, all of you
Just take my hand and I’ll be the man your dad hoped that I’d be
And we’ll build this love from the ground up
For worse or for better
And I will be all you need
Beside you I’ll stand through the good and the bad
We’ll give all that we have
And we’ll build this love from the ground up

[Verse 2: Dan & Shay]
This life will go by in the blink of an eye
But I wouldn’t wanna spend it without you by my side
The clouds are gonna roll
The earth’s gonna shake
But I’ll be your shelter
Through the wind and the rain

[Chorus 2: Dan & Shay]
And we’ll build this love from the ground up
Now til forever it’s all of me, all of you
Just take my hand and I’ll be the man your dad hoped that I’d be
And we’ll build this love from the ground up
For worse or for better
And I will be all you need
Beside you I’ll stand through the good and the bad
We’ll give all that we have
And we’ll build this love from the ground up

[Verse 3: Dan & Shay]
Someday we’ll wake up with thousands of pictures
Of 65 years in this little house
I won’t trade for nothin’ this life that we built
I’ll kiss you goodnight and say I love you still

[Chorus 3: Dan & Shay]
And we’ll build this love from the ground up
For worse or for better
And I will be all you need
Beside you I’ll stand through the good and the bad
We’ll give all that we have
And we’ll build this love from the ground up
From the ground up

[Verse 1: Dan + Shay]
Someday we're gonna look back on a night like tonight
The car I pulled up in, the necklace you're wearing won't even cross our minds
Someday we're gonna blink twice, say it happens like that
How much money we saved up for the time that we gave up
Well, it'll all just be math

[Chorus: Dan + Shay & Kelly Clarkson]
I know I'm only human
Don't know how many sunsets I got left
And I don't wanna ruin
This moment by wondering what comes next
I just wanna love you like it's all I'm living for
Hold you close, enjoy you more
And spend a little less time keeping score

[Verse 2: Kelly Clarkson  with Dan + Shay]
If we're rich to somebody, we're poor to somebody else
We could be happy and nameless
Or broken and famous
But, from what I can tell
Is that it doesn't really matter
You can't take it with you when you go
Life is only getting faster (life is only getting faster)
So, baby, I'd rather take tonight nice and slow

[Chorus: Dan + Shay & Kelly Clarkson]
'Cause I know I'm only human
Don't know how many sunsets I got left
And I don't wanna ruin
This moment by wondering what comes next
I just wanna love you like it's all I'm living for
Hold you close, enjoy you more
And spend a little less time keeping score

[Bridge: Dan + Shay with Kelly Clarkson]
Be with me now
Be with me right now
Be with me right here, right now
Be with me now
Be with me right now
Be with me right here, right now

[Outro: Dan + Shay & Kelly Clarkson]
I know I'm only human
Don't know how many sunsets I got left
And I don't wanna ruin
This moment by wondering what comes next
I just wanna love you like it's all I'm living for
Hold you close, enjoy you more
And spend a little less time keeping score
Oh, yeah
Keeping score

[Verse 1]
I'm jealous of the blue jeans that you're wearing
And the way they're holding you so tight
I'm jealous of the moon that keeps on staring
So lock the door and turn out the night

[Chorus]
I want you all to myself
We don't need anyone else
Let our bodies do the talking
Let our shadows paint the wall
I want you here in my arms
We'll hide away in the dark
Slip your hand in my back pocket
Go and let your long hair fall
I want you all to myself
To myself

[Verse 2]
I'm jealous of the song that you've been singing
And the way it's rolling off your lips
It might be selfish but I'm thinking
I don't need nothing between you
Leaning for another kiss, yeah

[Chorus]
I want you all to myself
We don't need anyone else
Let our bodies do the talking
Let our shadows paint the wall
I want you here in my arms
We'll hide away in the dark
Slip your hand in my back pocket
Go and let your long hair fall
I want you all, all, all to myself
To myself, yeah

[Bridge]
Girl, I want you in the worst way
Yeah, I want you in the worst way (Mmmm)

[Chorus]
I want you all to myself
We don't need anyone else (No one else, baby)
Let our bodies do the talking
Let our shadows paint the wall (Paint the wall)
I want you here in my arms
We'll hide away in the dark (Hide away in the dark)
Slip your hand in my back pocket
Go and let your long hair fall
I want you all, all, all to myself
To myself
I want you all, all, all to myself
To myself, yeah

[Intro]
I can honestly understand why it's over
I can go through the motions of walking away
I can give you the key and take my things back
I can find plenty things to fill my days

[Chorus]
But I don't know how not to
Think about you
When it's late at night and quiet
And I know that I ought to be the one who
Is strong and just moves on
But I'd probably turn down your road
Knock, knock on your door
Fall back in your arms
Wake up in the morning
Hatin' myself and the way that I can't help
The way I still want you
I just don't know how not to
How not to
How not to
I just don't know how not to
How not to
How not to

[Verse 1]
You're like second nature, baby, you're just like breathing
Melody that you hear and you can't forget
Time goes by and I still need you
Yeah, you're worth the heartbreak and the regret

[Chorus x 2]
But I don't know how not to
Think about you
When it's late at night and quiet
And I know that I ought to be the one who
Is strong and just moves on
But I'd probably turn down your road
Knock, knock on your door
Fall back in your arms
Wake up in the morning
Hatin' myself and the way that I can't help
The way I still want you
I just don't know how not to
How not to
How not to
I just don't know how not to
How not to
How not to

[Outro]
How not to
Mmmmmm
Oh-oh-oh-oh

[Verse 1]
I talk to God about you
And I ain't even met you yet
Everybody's waitin' on you here
I can't wait to feel your heart beat
When I lay you on my chest
I'm already holding back my tears
I wanna be the dad that my dad was
I hope that I don't mess this whole thing up

[Chorus]
I pray you love like your momma
And you forgive just like she does
And when this life knocks you down
I hope you get down on your knees
Cause that's what I do, that's what I do
When I pray for you
Oh, and I pray for you

[Verse 2]
I know you're gonna grow up some day
But don't forget to take your time
And take the time to call back home
It ain't always gonna be easy
It ain't always gonna be fair
I know you ain't always gonna need me
But I promise that I'll always be there

[Chorus]
I pray you love like your momma
And you forgive just like she does
And when this life knocks you down
I hope you get down on your knees
Cause that's what I do, that's what I do
When I pray for you
Oh, and I pray for you

[Bridge]
I talk to God about you
When everything around me breaks
I look up and hear him say

[Chorus]
Love like your momma
And forgive just like she does
And when this life knocks you down
I hope you get down on your knees
Cause that's what I do, thats what I do
When I pray for you
When I pray for you
When I pray for you

[Verse 1]
I remember when I first met you
Sipping coffee in a corner booth
You were twirling your hair
And I just had to stare
For a minute or two

[Verse 2]
I was laughing at your stack of books
Then you shot me that smile
Hey beautiful girl, in your own little world
Let me in it

[Pre-Chorus]
You got all of my attention
And you ain't even trying
Yeah, you're my kind of different
And I never seen nothing

[Chorus]
Nothing like you
Shades on spinning in a summer rain
Dancing when there ain't no music
Just the right kind of crazy, baby
Something about you
Rocking that rock 'n roll t-shirt
We're at a party dressed up
But you just doing your thing
Ain't nobody ever seen nothing like you

[Verse 2]
When you're wearing them worn out jeans
Purple untied shoestrings
You're a light in the dark
And you're stealing my heart like a gypsy

[Verse 3]
I love the way that you kiss me
In front of everybody
So baby come and kiss me
They ain't ever seen nothing

[Chorus]
Nothing like you
Shades on spinning in a summer rain
Dancing when there ain't no music
Just the right kind of crazy, baby
Something about you
Rocking that rock 'n roll t-shirt
We're at a party dressed up
But you just doing your thing
Ain't nobody ever seen nothing like you, yeah
Nothing like you
Shades on spinning in a summer rain
Dancing when there ain't no music
Nothing like you
Rocking that rock 'n roll t-shirt
We're at a party dressed up
But you just doing your thing
Ain't nobody ever seen nothing like you

[Outro]
Never seen, never seen nothing like you
Ain't never seen anything like you
Never seen nothin' like you

[Verse 1]
I couldn't help but notice you were sitting by yourself
Dropping limes in a Corona like you're trying to get over somebody else
It's funny how your story sounds a little like mine
Oh, cause' I've been at a table with a bottle peeling labels to pass the time

[Pre-Chorus]
We can be blue as a neon light
Singing them sad love songs all night
We can say goodbye, just head home
But if we're gonna be alone

[Chorus]
We should be alone together
Kissing over there in the corner
Where nobody else can see
Keeping each other company
We should be alone together
Leaning up against my car door
Parked outside on the street
Where it's just you and me
We should be alone together

[Verse 2]
I couldn't help but notice
You could use another drink
Yeah, I don't wanna leave ya
And it's two for one Tequila, so what you think?

[Pre-Chorus]
We can be blue as a neon light
Singing them sad love songs all night
We can say goodbye, just head home
But if we're gonna be alone

[Chorus]
We should be alone together
Kissing over there in the corner
Where nobody else can see
Keeping each other company
We should be alone together
Leaning up against my car door
Parked outside on the street
Where it's just you and me
We should be alone together
We should be alone together
We should be alone together, oh yeah

[Bridge]
We should be alone together
Over there in the corner where nobody else can see

[Chorus]
We should be alone together
Kissing over there in the corner
Where nobody else can see
Keeping each other company
We should be alone together
Leaning up against my car door
Parked outside on the street
Where it's just you and me
We should be alone together
We should be alone together
We should be alone together, oh yeah
We should be alone together

[Verse 1]
These fancy things in magazines
Diamond rings and beauty queens
But nothin' seems to sparkle like you do
These fine cigars and caviar
Expensive cars and movie stars
But everything I need is in this room
Oh, and I've seen the lights from New York to Vegas
And I've tasted wine from Venice to Paris
And I've seen the sights
Nothin' comparin' to you

[Chorus]
So I ain't lookin' over fences tryna find a better view
My search for all that ended when I first laid eyes on you
And the grass is always greener
'Cause the sun shines when you smile
And when I'm holdin' you the world makes sense
On my side of the fence

[Verse 2]
If I ever win the lottery
It wouldn't mean a lot to me, 'cause I already got you to hold my hand
And if a genie gave me a million wishes
I'd spend them all on all your kisses
And save just one to stay right where I am

[Chorus]
So I ain't lookin' over fences tryna find a better view
My search for all that ended when I first laid eyes on you
And the grass is always greener
'Cause the sun shines when you smile
And when I'm holdin' you the world makes sense
On my side of the fence

[Bridge]
You're the rain on the roof in the summer
You're the leaves in the fall changing color
You're the whisper I hear in the thunder
On my side of the fence
You're the reason my heart's beating faster
You're the tears falling down from the laughter
You're the only one I'm after

[Chorus]
So I ain't looking over fences trying to find a better view
My search for all that ended when I first laid eyes on you
And the grass is always greener
'Cause the sun shines when you smile
And when I'm holdin' you the world makes sense
Baby, when I'm holdin' you the world makes sense
On my side of the fence

[Outro]
You know it does, baby
On my side of the fence
Ooh

[Verse 1]
It was our first week at Myrtle Beach
Where it all began
It was 102, nothin' to do
Man, it was hot, so we jumped in

[Pre-Chorus]
We were summertime sippin', sippin'
Sweet tea kissin' off of your lips
T-shirt drippin', drippin' wet
How could I forget?

[Chorus]
Watchin' that blonde hair swing
To every song I'd sing
You were California beautiful
I was playin' everything but cool
I can still hear that sound
Of every wave crashin' down
Like the tears we cried that day we had to leave
It was everything we wanted it to be
The summer of 19 you and me

[Verse 2]
We had our first dance in the sand
It was one hell of a souvenir
Tangled up, so in love
You said, "Let's just stay right here"

[Pre-Chorus]
'Til the sun starts creepin', creepin' up
Right then, I knew
Just what you were thinkin', thinkin' of
When I looked at you

[Chorus]
Watchin' that blonde hair swing
To every song I'd sing
You were California beautiful
I was playin' everything but cool
I can still hear that sound
Of every wave crashin' down
Like the tears we cried that day we had to leave
It was everything we wanted it to be
The summer of 19 you and me, yeah, oh
You and me

[Bridge]
Watchin' that blonde hair swing
To every song I'd sing
You were California beautiful
Beautiful (Beautiful), beautiful

[Chorus]
Watching that blonde hair swing
To every song I'd sing
You were California beautiful (Beautiful)
I was playin' everything but cool
I can still hear that sound
Of every wave crashin' down (Of every wave crashin' down)
Like the tears we cried that day we had to leave
It was everything we wanted it to be
The summer of 19 you and me
Mmm

[Outro]
First week, Myrtle Beach
Where it all began

[Intro]
Girl, I wanna be, wanna be, what keeps you up at night

[Verse 1]
You and me and these headlights
Engine idling in your drive
45 in a goodbye, yeah
I should probably get to goin'
Sun will rise before we know it
But while the moon is still glowing
Let me leave a little taste on your lips
A little chill runnin' under your skin
So when it's a quarter past three, you're still thinking 'bout me

[Chorus]
Girl, I wanna be what keeps you up at night
Tossing and turning, head spinning, like you're dizzy off of red wine
Oh, I wanna kiss you 'til I can't get off your mind
Girl, I wanna be, wanna be, what keeps you up at night (yeah)

[Verse 2]
A little spray of my cologne all over your pillows
Still feels like I'm so close
Let me leave my shape in your bed
Let me leave a little song in your head
Make you dance in the dark like you're still in my arms

[Chorus]
Girl, I wanna be what keeps you up at night
Tossing and turning, head spinning, like you're dizzy off of red wine
Oh, I wanna kiss you 'til I can't get off your mind
Girl, I wanna be, wanna be, what keeps you up at night
Mmm, oh, wanna be, I wanna be, yeah

[Bridge]
So when you're wide awake
And I'm the only thing on your brain
Just call and I'll be there to fall right in your sheets

[Chorus]
Girl, I wanna be what keeps you up at night
Tossing and turning, head spinning, like you're dizzy off of red wine
Oh, I wanna kiss you 'til I can't get off your mind
Girl, I wanna be, wanna be, what keeps you up at night

[Outro]
Girl, I wanna be, wanna be, what keeps you up at night

[Verse 1]
Lately, it's been hard to breathe
Just trying to keep my head above water
Sometimes life's in the way, all work and no play
And lately, it's been hard to see the way you used to be
And I wonder, if the words I don't say can make it okay

[Pre-Chorus]
But I've been thinking bout us
And I know that the going is rough
And it feels like a little too much
Maybe I don't say it enough
So listen

[Chorus]
Girl, you know you're beautiful
I used to tell you all the time
But when you let your hair down it still drives me crazy
Something like a miracle that I get to call you mine
So baby, have I told you that I love you, lately

[Verse 2]
Baby, we can stay at home or ditch the phone, don't have to go nowhere
And get lost in your eyes
Let the time fly by
Baby, it don't matter what tomorrow brings
You know I'll be right there
Today and tonight, the rest of my life

[Pre-Chorus]
I've been thinking bout us
And I know the going is rough
And it feels like a little too much
Maybe I don't say it enough

[Chorus]
Girl, you know you're beautiful
I used to tell you all the time
But when you let your hair down it still drives me crazy
Something like a miracle that I get to call you mine
So baby, have I told you that I love you, lately

[Bridge]
Oh yeah
Have I told you, lately
Ooh mmm

[Refrain]
Have I told that I love you, that you're funny that you're sweet
And I love what's outside and everything that's underneath
Have I told you that I miss you every second I'm asleep
And I love the way you smiling when I kiss you in my dreams
Have I told you? Mmm
Have I told you?

[Chorus]
Girl, you know you're beautiful
I used to tell you all the time
But when you let your hair down, it still drives me crazy
You're beautiful, gonna tell you all the time
'Cause when you let your hair down, it still drives me crazy
Something like a miracle, I can't believe that you're all mine
So baby have I told you you that I love you, Lately

[Refrain]
Have I told you that I love you, that you're funny, that you're sweet
And I love what's outside and everything that's underneath, lately
Have I told you that I miss you every second I'm asleep
And I love the way you smiling when I kiss you in my dreams
Have I told you?
Have I told you?
Lately

[Verse 1]
You sure know how to pick 'em now, don't ya?
That job, that smile, that might kiss you goodnight
So take it easy on me now, won't ya?
You know just what gets to me every time
Sayin' I ain't gonna call, then I call
Now I'm in a car, driving too fast, goin' too far

[Chorus]
That stupid love
Just when I thought that I kicked that habit
You work a little midnight magic
And there I go again
Fallin' back in that stupid love, pulling me in like a boomerang
It's always the same damn thing
Can't get enough
'Nuff of that stupid lo-love, lo-love, lo-love, love, love, love

[Verse 2]
I hate the way I need ya when you're leaving
You come and go
You do just what you like, yeah
We break up just to make up
Slide your makeup off the counter
Goin' back and forth for hours
Baby, I ain't got the power to fight

[Chorus]
That stupid love
Just when I thought that I kicked that habit
You work a little midnight magic
And there I go again
Fallin' back in that stupid love, pulling me in like a boomerang
It's always the same damn thing
Can't get enough
'Nuff of that stupid lo-love, lo-love, lo-love, love, love, love

[Bridge]
That stupid love, love, love
That stupid love, love, love
Fallin' back in

[Outro]
That stupid love (hey)
Just when I thought that I kicked that habit (thought that I kicked that habit)
You work a little midnight magic (work that midnight magic)
And there I go again
Fallin' back in (oh) that stupid love (yeah)
Pulling me in like a boomerang (oh-oh)
It's always the same damn thing (damn thing)
Can't get enough
'Nuff of that stupid lo-love, lo-love, lo-love, love, love, love
Can't get enough, can't get enough
Need it too much, stupid love
Lo-love, lo-love, lo-love, love, love, love
Oh-oh, yeah
Lo-love, lo-love, lo-love, love, love, love

[Intro]
Oh

[Verse 1]
Its just another Friday
Staring at herself in the bathroom mirror
Its just another deep breath
Half an hour and he'll be here
Its just another friend of a friend
Oh, it ain't nothing
Its only just a drink or two
It'll be alright

[Chorus]
She's putting on her lipstick
Turning up the music
Slippin' on her black dress
Saying you can do this
Climbing in the front seat
Looking out the window
Going through the motions
Trying just to let go
Of the tears that she cried, no solid goodbye
Tonight it ain't gonna show
And even though she knows that it ain't gonna fix it
She's putting on her lipstick

[Verse 2]
Sitting at a red light
Staring at herself in the sideview mirror
He says shes beatiful (She's beautiful)
Like he knows what she wants to hear
So she plays right along as the night goes on
It'll only be a drink or two

[Chorus]
She's putting on her lipstick
Turning up the music
Slippin' on her black dress
Saying you can do this
Climbing in the front seat
Looking out the window
Going through the motions
Trying just to let go
Of the tears that she cried, no solid goodbye
Tonight it ain't gonna show
And even though she knows that it ain't gonna fix it
She's putting on her lipstick
She's putting on her lipstick

[Bridge]
So they drink and they dance
And he talks and she laughs
For a minute ain't nothing wrong
She's putting on her lipstick
Slippin' on her black dress
Turning up the music
Saying you can do this
Yeah you can do this

[Chorus]
Putting on her lipstick
Turning up the music
Slippin' on her black dress
Saying you can do this
Climbing in the front seat
Looking out the window
Going through the motions
Trying just to let go
Of the tears that she cried, no solid goodbye
Tonight it ain't gonna show
And even though she knows that it ain't gonna fix it
She's putting on her lipstick

[Outro]
Oh
Its just another Friday
Staring at herself in the bathroom mirror
Mmm

[Verse 1]
Candles burning, ruby red
Sheets are falling off the bed
Run your fingers through my hair
I know what you're thinking, take me there
You hypnotise me with your touch
And I can never get enough of you, it's true
And anywhere you wanna go
My hand is only yours to hold, oh you know

[Chorus]
I'm so obsessed with the way that your lips
Kiss me like crazy, oh you amaze me
When you walk in the room, you got me losing it
Yeah I'm a mess, girl I confess, I'm so obsessed, yeah

[Verse 2]
Every time you walk away
I guess your perfume likes to stay
On my pillow, on my shirt
Listen baby, for what it's worth

[Chorus]
I'm so obsessed with the way that your lips
Kiss me crazy, oh you amaze me
When you walk in the room, you got me losing it
Yeah I'm a mess, girl I confess, I'm so obsessed, yeah yeah yes

[Bridge]
So give it to me
Give it to me, give it to me now

[Chorus]
And I'm so obsessed with the way that your lips
Kiss me crazy, oh you amaze me
When you walk in the room, got me losing it babe
Yeah I'm a mess, girl I confess, I'm so obsessed, oh babe, yeah

[Outro]
When your friends are around
And you kiss me in front of everybody
You know it drives me crazy girl
So come and lay one on my lips girl
Just do it to me, you know it, I'm so obsessed
You're never getting rid of me baby
Never getting rid of me baby
You know it, you know
You're never getting rid of me baby
Never getting rid of me baby
Break it down for me baby
Girl you know you're driving me crazy
I can't get enough
I think you're feeling me too baby
So lay me down, show me right, do me good
Let's turn out these lights baby
I'm so obsessed with the way that you walk into the room baby
I can't even take it, you know, you know you do
I guess what I'm trying to say is, I'm obsessed baby

[Intro]
Ro-o-oad... trippin', trippin', trippin', trippin'

[Verse 1]
I've been thinkin', yeah
It's been awhile since we got outta town
So, what ya thinkin', yeah
If you're ready I could come over right now
You call the girls, I'll call the boys
We'll pack it up and drive
Anywhere you wanna go, we'll go there tonight
We can fit four in the backseat
If the cops come, we'll hide
Are you ready?
You know I'm ready, let's ride

[Chorus]
Road trippin', summertime living
With your hands out kissing the wind
Yeah, let's roll with it, radio kicking it louder we're at it again
Stuck a little somethin' in my old backpack (and)
Break it out later if ya like that
When the sun's dippin', we'll stop to start sippin'
Ro-o-o-oad... trippin', trippin', trippin', trippin'
Ro-o-oad... trippin', trippin', trippin', trippin'

Oh-oh-oh

[Verse 2]
Hit the river, yeah
Skinny dippin', jumping off of the rocks
Out to the ocean, yeah
Put a blanket down under the Boardwalk and kick it
We'll live it up and throw it down with all of our best friends
We'll drop the top and hit a spot where summer never ends
Cause a good time and a piece of mind are just around the bend
Are you ready?
You know I'm ready...

[Chorus]
For road trippin', summertime living
With your hands out kissing the wind
Yeah, let's roll with it, radio kicking it louder we're at it again
Stuck a little somethin' in my old backpack (and)
Break it out later if ya like that
When the sun's dippin', we'll stop to start sippin'
Ro-o-o-oad... trippin', trippin', trippin', trippin'
Ro-o-oad... trippin', trippin', trippin', trippin'

Oh-oh-oh

[Bridge]
When the sun comes up
And it feels like this is the end
We can do it all over, over again....

[Chorus]
Road trippin', summertime living
With your hands out kissing the wind
Yeah, let's roll with it, radio kicking it louder we're at it again
Yeahhh
Road trippin', summertime living
With your hands out kissing the wind
Yeah, let's roll with it, radio kicking it louder we're at it again
(You know we're at it again)
Stuck a little somethin' in my old backpack
Break it out later if ya like that
When the sun's dippin', we'll stop to start sippin'
Ro-o-o-oad... trippin', trippin', trippin', trippin'
Ro-o-oad... trippin', trippin', trippin', trippin'

[Outro]
(Here we go baby)
Yeah, we're road trippin'
That's how we do
Crack the backpack and I'll pass one to you
(You know where we do it baby)
Ro-o-o-oad trippin'

[Verse 1]
Phones lighting up, grab my favourite shirt and my keys on the counter
'Cause you said you wanna dance
Halfway down the drive must've changed your mind
It ain't even been an hour, tell me you've got other plans
I wouldn't be surprised if later or tonight
You're calling, begging me to come over

[Chorus]
'Cause baby, I'm caught up in the back and forth
I'm somewhere in the middle of you
And I don't know what I do it for
You love me, you hate me
You make me, you break me
Ooh, yeah

[Verse 2]
Ooh, when you do what you do, it's like you do it on purpose
Got me spinning in circles
First you say you're mad, then you take it back
Like you've forgotten all about it
I don't even understand

[Chorus]
Why baby, I'm caught up in the back and forth
I'm somewhere in the middle of you
And I don't know what I do it for
You love me, you hate me
You make me, you break me

[Bridge]
You love me, you hate me
You make me, you break me
Ooh, it's like you do it on purpose

[Outro]
And baby, I'm caught up in the back and forth
I'm somewhere in the middle of you
And I don't know what I do it for
You love me, you hate me
You make me, you break me
I'm somewhere in the middle of you
(Somewhere in the middle of you)
And I don't know what I do it for
You love me, you hate me
You make me, you break me
Ooh, you break me
Ooh
You love me, you hate me
Oh, you break me

[Verse 1]
You're giving me a million reasons to let you go
You're giving me a million reasons to quit the show
You're givin' me a million reasons
Give me a million reasons
Givin' me a million reasons
About a million reasons

If I had a highway, I would run for the hills
If you could find a dry way, I'd forever be still
But you're giving me a million reasons
Give me a million reasons
Givin' me a million reasons
About a million reasons

[Chorus]
I bow down to pray
I try to make the worst seem better
Lord, show me the way
To cut through all his worn out leather
I've got a hundred million reasons to walk away
But baby, I just need one good one to stay

[Verse 2]
Head stuck in a cycle, I look off and I stare
It's like that I've stopped breathing but completely aware
'Cause you're giving me a million reasons
Give me a million reasons
Givin' me a million reasons
About a million reasons

And if you say something that you might even mean
It's hard to even fathom which parts I should believe
'Cause you're giving me a million reasons
Give me a million reasons
Givin' me a million reasons
About a million reasons

[Chorus]
I bow down to pray
I try to make the worst seem better
Lord, show me the way
To cut through all his worn out leather
I've got a hundred million reasons to walk away
But baby, I just need one good one to stay

[Bridge]
Oh, baby I'm bleedin', bleedin'
Can't give me what I'm needin', needin'
Every heartbreak makes it hard to keep the faith
But baby, I just need one good one
Good one, good one, good one, good one, good one

[Choru]
When I bow down to pray
I try to make the worst seem better
Lord, show me the way
To cut through all his worn out leather
I've got a hundred million reasons to walk away
But baby, I just need one good one, good one
Tell me that you'll be the good one, good one
Baby, I just need one good one to stay

[Verse 1]
Got a call from a friend
Said "you should come over
All your friends are already over"
Took you 20 minutes just to find a dress
You like the dress, you say yes
Green, red, yellow, blue
Yeah, they're all just right on you
Don't worry, you look beautiful
Hair up, hair down
Another 20 minutes to get out the house
Call a cab and we jump in it

[Pre-Chorus]
Finally walk in
I'm already thinking 'bout leavin'
Gotta get you back in my shirt
Get you out that dress
Get you out those shoes that you like so much
Everybody at the party is checking your body out
I don't even mind it cause you're coming with me, girl
And I know it's only 7:32 but looking at you

[Chorus]
I'm already ready to go
I'm already ready, are you ready?
Cause I'm ready to go

[Verse 2]
Wall to wall
Way too many people
The noise, the crowd
I don't even see 'em
Cause I'm talking to you, you're talking to me
I'm not tryin' to be antisocial
Everybody's probably wondering why we're standing in the corner all alone
Girl, you're so beautiful, yeah
You look good in the lights, but I wanna see you in the dark
Kiss your lips, it's only been a minute since

[Pre-Chorus]
We walked in
I'm already thinking 'bout leavin'
Gotta get you back in my shirt
Get you out that dress
Get you out those shoes you like so much
And everybody at the party is checking your body out
I don't even mind it cause you're coming with me, girl
And I know it's only 7:32 but looking at you

[Chorus]
I'm already ready to go
I'm already ready, are you ready?
Cause I'm ready to go, go

[Bridge]
We're halfway out the door
I can't wait anymore

[Pre-Chorus]
Yeah, I know we just walked in
I'm already thinking 'bout leavin'
Gotta get you back in my shirt
Get you out that dress
Get you out those shoes you like so much
And everybody at the party is checking your body out
I don't even mind it cause you're coming with me, girl
And I know it's only 7:32 but looking at you

[Chorus]
I'm already ready to go
I'm already ready, are you ready?
Cause I'm ready to go, go
Ready to go
I'm already ready to go
Ready to go

[Verse 1]
Is it just me or did the world stop spinning?
I swear I felt it slowing down for a minute
I know it sounds crazy
But looking at you, baby
With your summer hair that's falling down in slow motion
Your body's swaying like the waves in the ocean
I know, that you're thinking, exactly what I'm thinking

[Pre-Chorus]
If I could go anywhere
I wouldn't go anywhere
I'm already there

[Chorus]
Girl, we ain't gotta leave this room
To make it feel like a honeymoon
Don't need copper-tone on your skin
When my hands can still pretend
Girl, we don't need a white sand beach
When your lips get to kissing on me
It already feels like paradise
We'll take it nice and slow tonight
Loving on island time

[Verse 2]
Ain't gotta worry about a beach bar closing
I gotta bottle of tequila we can open right here
I'm just saying, it's like we're on vacation

[Chorus]
Girl, we ain't gotta leave this room
To make it feel like a honeymoon
Don't need copper-tone on your skin
When my hands can still pretend
Girl, we don't need a white sand beach
When your lips get to kissing on me
It already feels like paradise
We'll take it nice and slow tonight
Loving on island time
Loving on island time, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
If I could go anywhere
I wouldn't go anywhere
I'm already there

[Outro]
Girl, we ain't gotta leave this room
To make it feel like a honeymoon
Don't need copper-tone on your skin
When my hands can still pretend
Girl, we don't need a white sand beach
When your lips get to kissing on me
It already feels like paradise
We'll take it nice and slow tonight
Loving on island time
Loving on island time

[Verse 1]
Too many people in this bar
I can't hear myself think over the guitar
I can tell that you wanna get outta here and disappear, don't ya, baby?
Too many lights on in the street
I can see the way that you're looking at me
And the way you're slipping off your Jimmy Choo's, like you wanted to since we got here
Now, we're driving down the highway, pulling into my place
Got your hand over on my knee
Now that we're alone
I'm gonna let you know everything you mean to me

[Chorus]
There's no such thing as too much money
'Cause if I had it all, I would spend it on you, honey
Time on your hands, baby, I can take it off ya, let me take it off ya
'Cause I'm love drunk
Sipping on your kiss a little too much, and I can't get enough
Like too much shine in a diamond ring, there's no such thing
There ain't no such thing
There ain't no such thing
There ain't no such thing, yeah

[Verse 2]
And just in case you didn't know
There ain't a second that I don't want you to hold your body on my body
You know it drives me crazy, don't ya, baby?

[Chorus]
There's no such thing as too much money
'Cause if I had it all, I would spend it on you, honey
Time on your hands, baby, I can take it off ya, let me take it off ya
'Cause I'm love drunk
Sipping on your kiss a little too much, and I can't get enough
Like too much shine in a diamond ring, there's no such thing
There ain't no such thing (hey)
There ain't no such thing (hey)
There ain't no such thing, yeah, baby

[Bridge]
There's no such thing
As too many stars in the sky
Too many hours in the night
With your body on my body, come on, baby

[Chorus]
There's no such thing as too much money
'Cause if I had it all, I would spend it on you, honey
Time on your hands, baby, I can take it off ya, let me take it off ya
'Cause I'm love drunk
Sipping on your kiss a little too much, and I can't get enough
Like too much shine in a diamond ring, there's no such thing

[Outro]
There ain't no such thing
There ain't no such thing
There ain't no such thing
There ain't no such thing
There ain't no such thing
There ain't no such thing

[Intro]
I drive away from your house, chasing butterflies out
Girl, I don't know how you do it

[Verse 1]
I said "Girl, you're beautiful, and you already know it
But I'll say it again and a million times after that"
You laugh and you shake your head and say
"Boy, you're crazy"
Well, girl, if I'm crazy, I'm only crazy 'bout you
I was lookin' right into your eyes, right then
Porch light
Flipped on and I saw your dad
Lookin' through the window
Hope he ain't mad
Then I helped you outta my truck
Through the yard to your front door
Said "Girl, am I gonna see you again?"
You answered me back with a kiss

[Chorus]
I drive away from your house, chasin' butterflies out
Girl, I don't know how you do it
Roll the radio down, say "I love you" out loud
Man, I think I'm 'bout to lose it
Ain't my thing to jump the gun
But I called my dad and said "She's the one"
Said "Boy, better get that ring
If you really wanna change her name"
Like a merry-go-round
Got my head spinning round and round and round
That's just what you do, do, do, do, do, do, do to me

[Verse 2]
I picked you up for our second date
You're sure looking pretty
Sweet as an angel, here to save my soul
Yeah, you get me high, you take me to heaven
And I get to shaking when you put your lips on mine
It could be the best night of my life, least 'til next time
Oh yea, gotta get this right
Follow all the rules and be back by 9
Pulled up to drop you off, leaning in to sneak one more
Said "Baby, when can I see you again?
How 'bout every night after this?"

[Chorus]
I drive away from your house, chasin' butterflies out
Girl, I don't know how you do it
Roll the radio down, say "I love you" out loud
Man, I think I'm 'bout to lose it
Ain't my thing to jump the gun
But I called my dad and said "She's the one"
Said "Boy, better get that ring
If you really wanna change her name"
Like a merry-go-round
Got my head spinning round and round and round
That's just what you do, do, do, do, do, do, do to me
That's just what you do, do, do, do, do, do, do to me

[Bridge]
Yea, that's just what you do

[Chorus]
I drive away from your house, chasin' butterflies out
Girl, I don't know how you do it
Roll the radio down, say "I love you" out loud
Man, I think I'm 'bout to lose it
Ain't my thing to jump the gun
But I called my dad and said "She's the one"
Said "Boy, better get that ring
If you really wanna change her name"
Like a merry-go-round
Got my head spinning round and round and round
That's just what you do, do, do, do, do, do, do to me
That's just what you do, do, do, do, do, do, do to me

[Verse 1]
I could tell by the way you kissed my lips that day
There was something missing, something not the same
You were there, but you weren't, didn't care, didn't hurt at all
Said it was what it was, then the feeling of us was gone

[Chorus]
I watched you fade away
But I turned my head and closed my eyes
And prayed you’d stay
And I told myself that it’d be fine
I wish I could have just said something, oh
When you said you needed time
I heard goodbye
Goodbye

[Verse 2]
It was way too easy to say those words you said
And the look on your face, I could tell there was nothing left
Almost wished we were fighting, screaming, and crying, but
Not a drop of a tear, didn't know how to feel, I was numb

[Chorus]
I watched you fade away
But I turned my head and closed my eyes
And prayed you’d stay
And I told myself that it’d be fine
I wish I could have just said something, oh
When you said you needed time
I heard goodbye
Goodbye

[Bridge]
I could try to hold on if I thought I could change your mind
But I don’t think I can when I feel like I feel tonight

[Chorus]
I watched you fade away
But I turned my head and closed my eyes
And prayed you’d stay
And I told myself that it’d be fine
I wish I could have just said something, oh
When you said you needed time
When you said you needed time
I heard goodbye
Goodbye

[Verse 1]
She was 18, all about me, grew up good on the
Tennessee river and her
Daddy didn't like me much
Yeah that might have been part of the rush
I was 21, just a son of a gun rolling like a stone I was born to run
But I never met a girl like that
Had me turning round coming right back
We were crazy, crazy in love like you've never know
She said baby don't you ever let me go

[Chorus]
We were fast car, top down
George Straight singing bare feet, slow dance long hair swinging
Under the neon sky, just watching the world go by
And we were laying by the river when the moon started dripping
Finally figured out what a boy been missing
Sinking into those eyes, yeah wrong never felt so right
We were small town, summertime sunset dreaming
Man there ain't nothing like a first time feeling

[Verse 2]
Wrapped up there in a blanket
Nervous kiss, hands were shaking
Yeah we knew we were getting into
There was magic underneath that moon, driving me
Crazy, more than she could ever know
And I said baby I ain't ever gonna let ya go

[Chorus]
We were fast car, top down
George Straight singing bare feet, slow dance long hair swinging
Under the neon sky, just watching the world go by
And we were laying by the river when the moon started dripping
Finally figured out what a boy been missing
Sinking into those eyes, yeah wrong never felt so right
We were small town, summertime sunset dreaming
Man there ain't nothing like a first time feeling

[Bridge]
Oh and the leaves fell down and the seasons changed
And that pretty little thing just moved away to
Texas I guess a part of me did too
Cause I miss her like crazy
She was my baby, take me back, take me back

[Chorus]
We were fast car, top down
George Straight singing bare feet, slow dance long hair swinging
Under the neon sky, just watching the world go by
And we were laying by the river when the moon started dripping
Finally figured out what a boy been missing
Sinking into those eyes, yeah wrong never felt so right
We were small town, summertime sunset dreaming
Man there ain't nothing like a first time feeling

[Verse 1]
You're like a sugar-sweet kiss in the morning
Sunshine pouring right into my window
Cool drink of water in the summer
Better than the other side of the pillow
You're everything that I'm not, and then a cherry on top
Yeah, girl, I gotta see you tonight
Yeah, I'm taking you out' cause damn baby I'm proud

[Chorus]
When a guy like me
Gets a girl like you
Yeah, you better know we're going to take it downtown
Showing everybody what I'm crazy about
Anywhere we go
Gotta let 'em all know
And I'mma tattoo your name on my arm
Baby I just wanna show you off

[Verse 2]
You gotta boy feeling lucky, how you love me
And you're making my heart go
Ticking like a time bomb, baby when the top drops
And I'm watching your hair blow
No, I don't wanna miss another kiss on your lips
Yeah, girl I gotta see you tonight
Pick you up about 8, counting down I can't wait

[Chorus]
When a guy like me
Gets a girl like you
Yeah, you better know we're going to take it downtown
Showing everybody what I'm crazy about
Anywhere we go
Gotta let 'em all know
And I'mma tattoo your name on my arm
Baby I just wanna show you off

[Bridge]
Yeah, show you off
Oh baby I just want to show you off
When a guy like me, gets a girl like you
You better know what I'm gonna do
What I'm gonna do, yeah

[Chorus]
When a guy like me
Gets a girl like you
Yeah, you better know we're going to take it downtown
Showing everybody what I'm crazy about
Anywhere we go
Gotta let 'em all know
And I'mma tattoo your name on my arm
Baby I just wanna show you off

[Outro]
Yeah, show you of
Baby I just wanna show you off

[Verse 1]
It's seven AM baby
Trying to catch up on a little sleep
Its way to early baby
For you to be crawling all over me
Next thing you know were driving round
She's dragging me all over town
Ain't no other girl in the world that can do me like that

[Chorus]
She knows how to work them cut off things
She knows how to get me to do about anything
How to bat those eyes, swing them hips
How to rock that cherry red lipstick
She knows I can't say no

[Verse 2]
Yeah baby that's all about all I can say
Whatever you want baby, as long as you kiss me that way
My heart of stone melts in her hands
I'm getting used to changing plans
Ain't no other girl in the world that can do me like that

[Chorus]
She knows how to work them cut off things
She knows how to get me to do about anything
How to bat those eyes, swing them hips
How to rock that cherry red lipstick
She knows I can't say no

[Bridge]
No to that smile
No to that kiss
No I just can't resist, Yeah
Yeah I could be out there with the boys, but as soon as I hear that little voice
I'm gone
Yeah I'm gone baby

[Chorus]
She knows how to work them cut off things
She knows how to get me to do about anything
How to bat those eyes, swing them hips
How to rock that cherry red lipstick
She knows I can't say no

[Outro]
Can't say no
Can't say no
I can't say no

[Intro]
Come on outside I got something to show ya
The sun is sinkin' and I'm dying to hold ya
There's a summertime southern breeze blowin' in the air tonight
Turn on the stereo, and leave the door open
Let's watch the moon and the fireflies glow in the sky
Forget the day and let it float away baby
Let's lose track of time

[Chorus]
And just, sway put your head on my shoulder, let the music come and take us over
Let me pull you in a little bit closer, baby close your eyes why don't we just
Stay right here in the moment, I wanna feel ya movin' nice and slow yeah
When there's nothin' words can say, let's dance the night away and just sway

[Verse 1]
We don't need a DJ or a dance floor
So leave your high heels there by the back door
'tween you and me we got all that we need
So let me hold ya tight from left to right baby

[Chorus]
We can sway put your head on my shoulder, let the music come and take us over
Let me pull you in a little bit closer, baby close your eyes why don't we just
Stay right here in the moment, I wanna feel ya movin' nice and slow yeah
When there's nothin' words can say, let's dance the night away and just sway, yeah
Just sway, yeah

My hands on your hips, your lips on my lips, kissin' all the worries away
Losin' ourselves, ain't nobody else around here to get in the way
Sway

[Chorus]
We can just sway put your head on my shoulder, let the music come and take us over
Let me pull you in a little bit closer, baby close your eyes why don't we just
Stay right here in the moment, I wanna feel ya movin' nice and slow yeah
When there's nothin' words can say, let's dance the night away and we can just sway, yeah
We can just sway, yeah

[Outro]
Come on outside I got somethin' to show ya
The sun is sinkin' and I'm dyin' to hold ya
Sway
Yeah

All them boys are spraying down and shining their wheels
And all them girls are getting pretty putting on heels;
Cause downtown there's a cover band warming up for the fever jam
Blondes in the bathroom washing X's off their hands
All of them party people stacking up in a line
Pushing up on each other like it's raining outside
But I'ma stay right here so we can disappear
Yeah I've been waiting all night

[Chorus:]
Take me to the party girl in the same t-shirt
That you wear to bed while the ceiling fan turns
To the rhythm that we're spinning bare feet on the floor in the living room light got me begging for more
Of that party girl strutting down the hall like a beauty queen long legs and all
Got me melting in the cushion of an old love seat
Don't get much better than you and me
And this party girl

I don't need all them humming, buzzing neon signs
Long as you got that come and get me look in your eyes
Yeah I'ma stay right here so we can disappear
We can do it up right

[Chorus:]
Take me to the party girl in the same t-shirt
That you wear to bed while the ceiling fan turns
To the rhythm that we're spinning bare feet on the floor in the living room light got me begging for more
Of that party girl strutting down the hall like a beauty queen long legs and all
Got me melting in the cushion of an old love seat
Don't get much better than you and me
And this party girl

Take me to the party girl, wearing nothing but that t-shirt
Laying down on an old love seat, nothing better than you and me

[Chorus:]
And that party girl in the same t-shirt
That you wear to bed while the ceiling fan turns
To the rhythm that we're spinning bare feet on the floor in the living room light got me begging for more
Of that party girl strutting down the hall like a beauty queen long legs and all
Got me melting in the cushion of an old love seat
Don't get much better than you and me
And this party girl

Ain't nothing better than you and me, girl
Yeah, so gimme that gimme that girl

[Intro]
1,2,3... Here we go
Yeah

[Verse 1]
I'ma walking out my front door
I'ma jumping in my car
Take another left on Main Street
Head right to where you are
I'ma rolling down my window
I'ma turn the radio on
Find a little spot to let go
Get a little good time gone

[Chorus]
Cause this is an all nighter
A get lost with you running through every red lighter
Falling and feeling like a star right out of a midnight skyer
Let the time fly by
Cause it's a finding her hand, taking a chance, starting a fire
This is an all nighter

[Verse 2]
Yes it is baby
Mmmm Yeah
We are gonna take that sunset
Make it turn the blue sky red
We can worry bout tomorrow
But what you say we live instead
Get a little dirt road dizzy
Let the moon shine on us
Getting all barefoot busy till the sun sneaks back up
Cause we just can't get enough

[Chorus]
This is an all nighter
A get lost with you running through every red lighter
I'm falling and feeling like a star right out of a midnight skyer
Let the time fly by
Cause it's a finding her hand, taking a chance, starting a fire
This is an all nighter

[Bridge]
10 o'clock kiss
12 o'clock cruise
Take another sip, talk until two
This is a never gonna have to say goodbyer

[Chorus]
This is an all nighter
A get lost with you running through every red lighter
I'm falling and feeling like a star right out of a midnight skyer
Let the time fly by
Cause it's a finding her hand, taking a chance, jumping a fence, do it again
All nighter, that's right
A get lost with you running through every red lighter
I'm falling and feeling like a star right out of a midnight skyer
Let the time fly by
Cause it's a finding her hand, taking a chance, starting a fire
This is an all nighter

[Outro]
Yes it is baby
This is an all nighter

[Verse 1]
Hey girl whatcha think about this, got a really good idea
Four wheel drive for the gas, whatcha think about that?
Forty miles off the map, we can get there real fast
We can just take it slow, let it roll if you wanna

[Chorus]
Kick back, move in on the down low
Where your sun tan lights up when the stars go
Write your name on the fogged up window
Throw your feet on the dash, girl you know I'm cool with that
And it's Tom Petty Free Fall by midnight
Turn it off, turn you on when it feels right
Out here in the wide open
Let yourself let go somewhere only we know

[Verse 2]
Hey girl whatcha think about this?
I really wanna kiss your lips
Gotta lot more room in the back, whatcha think about that?
Oh yeah let's get a little closer, lean in and I'll take over
We can just take it slow, let it roll if you wanna

[Chorus]
Kick back, move in on the down low
Where your sun tan lights up when the stars go
Write your name on the fogged up window
Throw your feet on the dash, girl you know I'm cool with that
And it's Tom Petty Free Fall by midnight
Turn it off, turn you on when it feels right
Out here in the wide open
Let yourself let go somewhere only we know

[Bridge]
Baby let it go baby, let it go
Let's park this thing 'til the morning
I think we got a really good thing going
Whatcha think about that?
You know what I think about that

[Chorus]
Kick back, move in on the down low
Where your sun tan lights up when the stars go
Write your name on the fogged up window
Throw your feet on the dash, girl you know I'm cool with that
And it's Tom Petty Free Fall by midnight
Turn it off, turn you on when it feels right
Out here in the wide open
Let yourself let go somewhere only we know

Baby let it go baby, let it go
Let yourself let go somewhere only we know

[Verse 1]
There's a two lane getaway red hot summer day
Jump into my '65 Mustang, ain't she a pretty thing?
Just like you, and it's burnin' me up, burnin' me up, burnin' me up
Yeah, tell me what I wanna hear
You're turnin' me on, turnin' me on, turnin' me on
Yeah baby let's get outta here

[Chorus]
Do you wanna wanna, do you wanna wanna go?
Pedal on the floorboard
Lay a little bit of rubber down this road
Bass bumpin' on the car door
Got a blue sky, got a fast ride
Got all the time in the world so come on little girl
Whoa, all we gotta do is stop, let the top drop and roll

[Verse 2]
We can leave town right now, take it down the interstate
Just get gone
Oh baby we could just get lost while the radio plays our favorite song
Well turnin' it up, turnin' it up, turnin' it up
That's just what I wanna hear
Burnin' me, up burnin' me up, burnin' me up
Yeah baby let's get out of here

[Chorus]
Do you wanna wanna, do you wanna wanna go?
Pedal on the floorboard
Lay a little bit of rubber down this road
Bass bumpin' on the car door
Got a blue sky, got a fast ride
Got all the time in the world so come on little girl
Whoa, all we gotta do is stop, let the top drop and roll

[Bridge]
Yeah, roll down the windows
Let your hair blow
Let your hair blow
Yeah, roll down the windows
Let your hair blow
Let it all blow
Let it all blow
We can leave town right now
Take it down the interstate

[Chorus]
Do you wanna wanna, do you wanna wanna go?
Pedal on the floorboard
Lay a little bit of rubber down this road
Bass bumpin' on the car door
Got a blue sky, got a fast ride
Got all the time in the world so come on little girl
Whoa, all we gotta do is stop, let the top drop and roll

[Outro]
Yeah, roll down the windows
Let your hair blow
Let it all blow
Let it all blow

[Intro]
Oooohhh yeah mmm

[Verse 1]
Wake up in the morning
T-shirt and coffee
Girl you already got me, yeah
Midnight eyes are shinning
Black dress in the city
Baby you look so pretty, mmm
You can make me wanna do
Anything you want me to
Tell me what you wanna do now

[Chorus]
Cause you make it easy
You get my heart beatting out of my chest
And the rest doesn't matter
You are the reason
For the way that I'm feeling now
And I ain't ever gonna stop
Loving you loving you round the clock
Loving you loving you round the clock

[Verse 2]
Stops when you're walking
And I can't stop staring
No it ain't what you're wearing, yeah
And I get so excited
When I see your name on my phone
Saying baby im home alone ,oh
Girl you know I wanna do
Anything you want me to
Tell me what you wanna do now

[Chorus]
Cause you make it easy
You get my heart beatting out of my chest

Loving you loving you

[Bridge]
Every minute every day
Every time I see your face
I just wanna love you out loud, yeah
Girl you know I wanna do
Anything you want me to
Tell me what you wanna do now

[Chorus]
Cause you make it easy
Girl you know you know you know

You are the reason
For the way that Im feeling now
(The way that I'm feeling now)
And I ain't never gonna stop
Loving you loving you round the clock
(Loving you loving you round the clock babe)
Loving you loving you round the clock

[Outro]
Tick, tick, tick

Monday mornin' here with you
Under this bed sheet parachute
Skin so soft, eyes so blue
The lightning strikes and the rain falls too
So let it fall, let our worries wash away
Let it roll down our windows, all wrapped up we'll stay

[Chorus]
Lady, we can lay here and be lazy
Let it all go, I'll be a pillow, slide just a little closer, let me warm you up
Darling, drown in a river that you're caught in
I wanna get lost in your silhouette, and don't forget that red, wet kiss on my lips
We don't have to go outside, baby just close your eyes

Hold your body like a sweet, sweet rose
From your long brown hair to your curled up toes
Pull you in, keep you close
I wanna know the you nobody knows
Baby fall, you're safe here in my arms
We can cover all the windows and hide out in the dark

[Chorus]
Lady, we can lay here and be lazy
Let it all go, I'll be a pillow, slide just a little closer, let me warm you up
Darling, drown in a river that you're caught in
I wanna get lost in your silhouette, and don't forget that red, wet kiss on my lips
We don't have to go outside, baby just close your eyes

[Chorus]
Lady, we can lay here and be lazy
Let it all go, I'll be a pillow, slide just a little closer, let me warm you up
Darling, drown in a river that you're caught in
I wanna get lost in your silhouette, and don't forget that red, wet kiss on my lips
We don't have to go outside, baby just close your eyes

I'm gunna hold your body like a sweet sweet rose
From your long brown hair to your curled up toes

[Verse 1: Dan + Shay]
Dash light dripping on your sun tan skin
Radio playing that song again
Just pull me in, pull me in
Cut off shorts and a vinyl seat
Slide on over here next to me
Let me pull you in, let me pull you in girl
Ooh, if you didn't know by now I'm crazy about you
And I know the perfect place to stop

[Chorus: Dan + Shay]
The smell of honey suckle on a river bank
Fireflies, sweet tea, and the summer rain
Pouring all the way, all the way down
Cherry red lips calling out my name
Two-tone Ford and that parking brake
Pushed all the way, all the way down
All the way down

[Verse 2: Dan + Shay]
Middle of the middle in nowhere now
Go ahead girl, let your hair down
Just close your eyes, it's going to be a damn good night
Cut off the engine, toss the keys
Ain't nobody here, but you and me
And a little moon light
Out here in the country side
Ooh, I gotta feeling that you're crazy about me, too
Girl and don't you ever stop

[Chorus: Dan + Shay]
The smell of honey suckle on a river bank
Fireflies, sweet tea, and the summer rain
Pouring all the way, all the way down
Cherry red lips calling out my name
Two-tone Ford and that parking brake
Pushed all the way, all the way down

[Bridge: Dan + Shay]
Ooh, yeah
If you already know by now I'm crazy about you
Oh, tell me what you wanna do

[Chorus: Dan + Shay]
The smell of honey suckle on a river bank
Fireflies, sweet tea, and the summer rain
Pouring all the way, all the way down
Cherry red lips calling out my name
Two-tone Ford and that parking brake
Pushed all the way, all the way down

[Outro: Dan + Shay]
Those cherry lips call my name
Yeah, yeah, yeah
All the way, all the way, all the way down, yeah
Ooh yeah, baby
All the way down

Have yourself a merry little Christmas
Let your heart be light
From now on, our troubles will be out of sight

Have yourself a merry little Christmas
Make the yuletide gay
From now on, our troubles will be miles away

Hear we are as in olden days
Happy golden days of yore
Faithful friends who are dear to us
Gather near to us once more

Through the years we all will be together
If the fates allow
Hang a shining star upon the highest bough

And have yourself a merry little Christmas now

[Verse 1]
Black dress
Struttin' on them loubitons like a hot mess
Sippin' on Dom Pérignon
And she says "A girl just wanna have fun"
You ain't gonna get none, alright (Alright, okay)

[Pre-Chorus]
Shouldn't like a villain in the corner of the club
Think I might be falling in love
Moving over to me like a devil in disguise
But you know tonight I don't mind

Chors
Ooh girl, I want ya
But I just don't trust ya
When you're shaking your body like that
Ooh girl, I need ya
But it's hard to keep ya when you leaving my heart on the floor
Na na na na na (I want more, more, more, more)
Ooh girl, gimme that

[Verse 2]
Midnight
She'll be gone, she'll turn it on that green light (Yeah)
Good to go and I know you know you don't mind
Crashing into your kiss, already got me falling like this, alright
Yeah, yeah

Chors
Ooh girl, I want ya
But I just don't trust ya
When you're shaking your body like that
Ooh girl, I need ya
But it's hard to keep ya when you leaving my heart on the floor
Na na na na na (I want more, more, more, more)
Ooh, girl, gimme that
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah
Oh yeah
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Bridge]
Shouldn't like a villain in the corner of the club
Think I might be falling in love (Oh, yeah, yeah)
Moving over to me like a devil in disguise
But you know tonight I don't mind, ha

[Break]
Ooh, I want ya
Yeah, but I just don't trust ya (I just don't trust ya)
When you're shaking your body like that, yeah, yeah

[Chorus]
Ooh girl, I want ya (You know I want ya, baby)
But I just don't trust ya
When you're shaking your body like that
Na na na na na
Ooh girl, I need ya (You know I need ya, baby)
But it's hard to keep ya when you're leaving my heart on the floor
Na na na na na (I want more, more, more, more, more)

Ooh girl, gimme that
(I want more, more, more, more, more)
(I want ya, baby)
Ooh girl, gimme that
Yeah, yeah

[Verse 1: Kane Brown]
You say what if I hurt you, what if I leave you
What if I find somebody else and I don't need you?
What if this goes south, what if I mess you up?
You say what if I break your heart in two, then what?

[Pre-Chorus: Kane Brown]
Well I hear you girl, I feel you girl, but not so fast
Before you make your mind up, I gotta ask

[Chorus: Kane Brown & Lauren Alaina]
What if I was made for you and you were made for me?
What if this is it, what if it's meant to be?
What if I ain't one of them fools just playin' some game?
What if I just pull you close, what if I lean in?
And the stars line up, and it's our last first kiss
What if one of these days, baby, I go and change your name?
What if I loved all these what ifs away?

[Verse 2: Kane Brown & Lauren Alaina]
What if the sky falls (Sky falls)
Or the sun stops burnin'?
We could worry about them what ifs 'til the world stops turnin'
Or I could kiss you (You should kiss me)
What if you liked it? (Bet I'd like it)
Well we ain't never gonna know unless we try it

[Chorus: Kane Brown & Lauren Alaina]
What if I was made for you and you were made for me?
What if this is it, what if it's meant to be?
What if I ain't one of them fools just playin' some game?
What if I just pull you close, what if I lean in?
And the stars line up, and it's our last first kiss
What if one of these days, baby, I go and change your name?
What if I loved all these what ifs away?
Awe yeah
C'mon

[Bridge: Kane Brown]
You say what if I hurt you, what if I leave you?
What if I find somebody else and I don't need you?
Damn

[Chorus: Kane Brown & Lauren Alaina]
What if I was made for you and you were made for me?
What if this is it, what if it's meant to be?
What if I ain't one of them fools just playin' some game?
What if I just pull you close, what if I lean in?
And the stars line up, and it's our last first kiss
What if one of these days, baby, I go and change your name?
What if I loved all these what ifs away?

[Outro: Kane Brown & Lauren Alaina]
Away (Away)
What if?

[Verse 1]
This is perfect
Come kiss me one more time
I couldn't dream this up
Even if I tried
You and me in this moment
Feels like magic, don't it?
I'm right where I wanna be

[Chorus]
Everybody's talkin' about heaven like they just can't wait to go
Sayin' how it's gonna be so good, so beautiful
Lyin' next to you, in this bed with you, I ain't convinced
'Cause, I don't know how, I don't know how heaven, heaven
Could be better than this

[Verse 2]
I swear you're an angel
Sent to this world
What did I do right to deserve you, girl?
I could stay here forever
I'd be fine if we never
Had to even leave this room

[Chorus]
Everybody's talkin' 'bout heaven like they just can't wait to go
Sayin' how it's gonna be so good, so beautiful
Lyin' next to you, in this bed with you, I ain't convinced
'Cause, I don't know how, I don't know how heaven, heaven
Could be better than this
Could be better than this

[Chorus]
Everybody's talkin' 'bout heaven like they just can't wait to go
Sayin' how it's gonna be so good, so beautiful
Lyin' next to you, in this bed with you, I ain't convinced
'Cause, I don't know how, I don't know how heaven, heaven
Could be better than this (heaven)
Could be better than this (heaven, heaven)

[Outro]
I swear this is perfect
Come kiss me one more time

[Verse 1]
Dancin' in the kitchen, you singing my favorite songs
Swinging on the front porch, just laughing at the dogs
How you swear you love me more
When you're whisperin' goodnight
All those little moments are every reason why

[Chorus]
I'm homesick
This feelin' that I'm feeling'
No, it don't quit
It's like half of me is missin'
Heaven knows it that all I wanna do
Is be alone with your brown eyes all tangled up
Just holdin' onto you tonight
Until the mornin'
Baby that's the damn truth
If home is where the heart is
Then I'm homesick for you

[Verse 2]
Well it says Kane Brown
On a sign with a line out the door
It sold out some little town
I've never been before
Yeah, they're screamin' my name
This is what we dreamed about
But out here singin' about you, baby, all I think about

[Chorus]
Is how I'm homesick
This feelin' that I'm feelin'
No, it don't quit
It's like half of me is missin'
Heaven knows it that all I wanna do
Is be alone with your brown eyes all tangled up
Just holdin' onto you tonight
Until the morning
Baby that's the damn truth
If home is where the heart is
I'm homesick for you

[Bridge]
Homesick for you
Yeah, yeah

[Chorus]
I'm homesick
This feelin' that I'm feelin'
No, it don't quit
It's like half of me is missin'
Heaven knows it that all I wanna do
Is be alone with your brown eyes, just tangled up
Just holdin' onto you tonight
Until the mornin'
Baby, that's the damn truth
If home is where the heart is
I'm homesick for you
I'm homesick for you
Yeah, yeah

[Verse 1]
See the way you're taking care of your Mama
The way you’re taking care of me
The way you light up any room, girl
You're what this world should be

[Pre-Chorus]
Tomorrow, tonight, the rest of my life
I wanna be the man you want me to be
So startin' right now, girl, tell me everything you need

[Chorus]
I just wanna wake up everyday here in this bed
Never leave "I love you" left unsaid
It might take a hundred lifetimes to do
But baby, I just wanna be good as you

[Verse 2]
Girl, you’re more than just the surface
Yeah, you got that heart of gold
So when it comes to loving you, babe
No, it will never get old

[Pre-Chorus]
Tomorrow, tonight, the rest of my life
I wanna be the man you want me to be
So startin' right now, girl, tell me everything you need

[Chorus]
I just wanna wake up everyday here in this bed
Never leave "I love you" left unsaid
It might take a hundred lifetimes to do
But baby, I just wanna be good as you
Good as you, baby

[Guitar Solo]

[Chorus]
I just wanna wake up everyday here in this bed
Never leave "I love you" left unsaid
In my take a hundred lifetimes to do
But baby, I just wanna be good as you
I just wanna wake up everyday here in this bed (Yeah with you baby)
Never leave "I love you left" unsaid
It might take a hundred lifetimes to do
But baby, I just wanna be good as you
Baby, I just wanna be good as you

[Intro]
Yeah

[Verse 1]
That lit up, ringing, buzzing good for nothing phone in your hands
With directions to the party that's just started with that cover band
That old school radio station, let's just drive until it's faded
Girl, let's lose it, tonight

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause when you do that thing right there
Flippin' your hair, baby, I swear

[Chorus]
I don't think you know what you're doing to me
You got my heart skip-skipping a beat
You're not close enough so that space between
You and me, let's lose it
The way you're dancin', swayin' to the music
Girl, that body and how you move it
Every time you cross my mind
Girl, I lose it
Yeah, I lose it
Yeah, I lose it

[Verse 2]
Let's start with them Luccheses
Baby, kick 'em to the floorboard
Them bobby pins holdin' your hair up
Girl, you don't need 'em no more
That dress hangin' off your shoulder as you move a little closer
Yeah, let's lose it tonight
Yeah girl

[Chorus]
I don't think you know what you're doin' to me
You got my heart skip-skipping a beat
You're not close enough so that space between
You and me, let's lose it
The way you're dancin', swayin' to the music
Girl, that body and how you move it
Every time you cross my mind
Girl, I lose it
Yeah, I lose it
Yeah, I lose it

[Bridge]
'Cause when you do that thing right there
Flippin' your hair, baby I swear
Um

[Chorus]
I don't think you know what you're doing to me
You got my heart skip-skipping a beat
You're not close enough so that space between
You and me, let's lose it
The way you're dancin', swayin' to the music
Girl, that body and how you move it
Every time you cross my mind
Girl, I lose it
Yeah, I lose it
Yeah, I lose it

[Outro]
Girl, I lose it
Yeah, I lose it

[Verse 1: Kane Brown]
Passed our exit five ago
Four lanes to county roads
Playlist lighting up the dark
808's and pounding hearts

[Pre-Chorus: Becky G & Both]
Won’t tell nobody where we're going
Just you and me and the headlights glowing
Girl don't you know you got the key to my heart
In my car, let’s go far

[Chorus: Kane Brown]
Lost in the middle of nowhere
Where there is no cares
Me and you out there all alone
Moonlight shining, county riding
Not one bar on our phones
Counting the white lines as they blur by
Till there's gravel on the ground
They won't find us if we don't wanna be found

[Post-Chorus: Kane Brown]
Lost in the middle of nowhere
Lost in the middle of nowhere

[Verse 2: Becky G]
Static building up in here
Where you take me, I don't care
The further we get, the closer we are
Blurring the lines under midnight stars

[Pre-Chorus: Becky G & Both]
Won't tell nobody where we're going
Just you and me and the headlights glowing
Yeah boy, I know you got the key to my heart
In your car, take me far

[Chorus: Kane Brown]
Lost in the middle of nowhere
Where there is no cares
Me and you out here all alone
Moonlight shining, county riding
Not one bar on our phones
Counting the white lines as they blur by
Till there's gravel on the ground
They won’t find us if we don’t wanna be found

[Post-Chorus: Kane Brown & Becky G]
Lost in the middle of nowhere
Lost in the middle of nowhere
(Lost in the middle of nowhere, yeah)

[Bridge: Kane Brown & Both]
We're young and the highway goes on forever
Come on girl, no time to waste, it’s now or never
We're young and the highway goes on forever
And ever and ever

[Chorus]
Lost in the middle of nowhere
Where there is no cares
Me and you out here all alone (Out here all alone)
Moonlight shining, county riding
Not one bar on our phones (Not one bar on our phones)
Counting the white lines as they blur by
Till there's gravel on the ground
They won't find us if we don’t wanna be found

[Post-Chorus]
Lost in the middle of nowhere (Nowhere)
(Lost in the middle of nowhere, yeah
Lost in the middle of nowhere)
Lost in the middle of nowhere

[Verse 1]
I be sitting in the same old bar
Heart breaking on a broken bar stool
Wishing she'd come running back
Running from the past
Runnin' up the tab, drinkin' for two
But that night my boys showed up
Dragged me out on the town
Had to pick me up
I'd never know what I was missin' if they didn't

[Chorus]
'Cause I'd have never found you
At that random house party that I didn't even wanna go to
The way you move
Had me first time feelin' in awhile I should make one too
Sometimes the finish line is just the start of something new
If I'd have never lost her
Then I'd have never found you
No, I'd have never found you
Never found you

[Verse 2]
Yeah, I still go out sometimes
But I don't ever try to get that drunk
Now and I can't sleep it's 'cause you're all over me in the sheets
All night keeping me up
Yeah, it's hard to believe that a goodbye could be
So good to me

[Chorus]
No, I'd have never found you
At that random house party that I didn't even wanna go to
The way you move
Had me first time feelin' in awhile I should make one too
Sometimes the finish line is just the start of something new
If I'd have never lost her
Then I'd have never found you
No, I'd have never found you
No, I'd have never found you

[Bridge]
And now I'm takin' back the way I said I wish I've never met
Sometimes the things that don't work out
Couldn't work out any better
I'd have never found you
No, I'd have never found you

[Chorus]
'Cause I'd have never found you
At that random house party that I didn't even wanna go to
The way you move
Had me first time feelin' in awhile I should make one too
Sometimes the finish line is just the start of something new
If I'd have never lost her
Then I'd have never found you
No, I'd have never found you
Never found, never found you
No, I'd have never found you

[Verse 1]
Wasn't really looking when you caught my eyes
Just another town, just another night
Didn't say much, I was scared for my life
I didn't catch your number and didn't know your name
Tried to move on, couldn't help to think of you
And I knew that you'd change everything

[Chorus]
What's mine is yours
Every breathe I take, every choice I make
It might sound crazy
All my pain, washed away, in the blink of an eye
Yeah, you saved me
You got all of me and I don't need it anymore
What's mine is yours
What's mine is yours
What's mine is yours

[Verse 2]
Now there's make up my counter
Your shoes on my floor
Taking my side of the bed and more
But it’s fine, I don’t mind, 'cause you changed everything

[Chorus]
What's mine is yours
Every breathe I take, every choice I make
It might sound crazy
All my pain, washed away, in the blink of an eye
Yeah, you saved me
You got all of me and I don't need it anymore
What's mine is yours
What's mine is yours
Yeah, yeah

[Bridge]
Take this ring
Forever now
Til death do us apart
And take this vow

[Chorus]
What's mine is yours
Every breathe I take, every choice I make
It might sound crazy
All my pain, washed away, in the blink of an eye
What's mine is yours
Every breathe I take, every choice I make
It might sound crazy
All my pain, washed away, in the blink of an eye
Yeah, you saved me
You got all of me and I don't need it anymore
What's mine is yours
What's mine is yours
Yeah, yeah

[Verse 1]
Baby, if your dream is forty acres and a house
Porch going all the way around
I'mma buy it
Or if you'd rather see
City lights and a crowd
I'mma move you uptown
It don't matter to me
Nah, it don't girl
Baby, I can see me livin' anywhere with you, so

[Chorus]
Til the sky falls and the good Lord calls us up
You're the only girl I wanna love
Til I'm pushing up daisies
Wanna stare into your green eyes, baby
Til we're hand-in-hand walking down them streets of gold
Six feet below, you know
I'm gonna make your world a better place
Til we're both in a better place

[Verse 2]
If all you wanna wear is faded blue jeans and a tee
Baby, that's fine with me
You look good in anything
Aw, but girl I swear
If you wanna hit the town in a dress, turn a few heads
I ain't gonna stop you
Baby, I got you, oh

[Chorus]
Til the sky falls and the good Lord calls us up
You're the only girl I wanna love
Til I'm pushing up daisies
Wanna stare into your green eyes, baby
Til we're hand-in-hand walking down them streets of gold
Six feet below, you know
I'm gonna make your world a better place
Til we're both in a better place

[Bridge]
Every night, every day
You're my everything
Til we fade away

[Chorus]
Til the sky falls and the good Lord calls us up
You're the only girl I wanna love
Til I'm pushing up daisies
Wanna stare into your green eyes, baby
Til we're hand-in-hand walking down them streets of gold
Six feet below, you know
I'm gonna make your world a better place
Til we're both in a better place
Til we're both in a better place
Better place girl

[Verse 1]
Life was great, wouldn't change a thing
I had it all, but with you I had more
But out of nowhere, out of the blue
Our love turned into a war
Now you're gone, you moved on
And I hate the way I'm feeling

[Chorus]
Now the only way I know that I can get you off my mind
To keep a bottle so close, try to leave it all behind
And I couldn't get enough
Girl, I'm drowning, drunk in love
I used to think you'd never say it's over
I used to love you sober
I used to love you sober

[Verse 2]
I'm on the floor, cursing at the door
Broken hearted with a pounding head
And I know, I gotta let you go
So the liquor helps me forget
Your name, your face
This pain I can't erase

[Chorus]
Now the only way I know that I can get you off my mind
To keep a bottle so close, try to leave it all behind
And I couldn't get enough
Girl, I'm drowning, drunk in love
I used to think you'd never say it's over
I used to love you sober
I used to love you sober

[Bridge]
Now you're gone
You moved on
And I hate the way I'm feeling...

[Chorus]
Now the only way I know that I can get you off my mind
To keep a bottle so close, try to leave it all behind
And I couldn't get enough
Girl, I'm drowning, drunk in love
I used to think you'd never say it's over
I used to love you sober
I used to love you sober

[Intro]
Love is like a rodeo, rodeo, rodeo, rodeo
Love is like a rodeo, rodeo, rodeo, rodeo

[Verse 1]
I picked you up with a cowboy nod at the hotel bar
It was less than eight seconds, girl, you stole my heart
We had drinks and smokes, played your songs on guitar
I was crazy out the gate and you were wild from the start
You hopped in my Bronco and we had the time of our life
We've come a long way since then, girl
But it's been one hell of a ride

[Chorus]
Love is like a rodeo, tryna see how far we go
After one touch, became obsessed with the rush
Yeah, love is like a rodeo, I just wanna steal the show
We fight and we fall, but we keep holding on
Love is like a rodeo, rodeo, rodeo, rodeo
Love is like a rodeo, rodeo, rodeo, rodeo

[Verse 2]
Girl, there's something kind of dangerous about the way you move
I knew it wouldn't be easy hanging on to you
'Cause when you hit the light, put your lips on mine
It gets hotter than a Houston night

[Chorus]
Yeah, love is like a rodeo, tryna see how far we go
After one touch, became obsessed with the rush
Yeah, love is like a rodeo, I just wanna steal the show
We fight and we fall, but we keep holding on
Love is like a rodeo, rodeo, rodeo, rodeo
Love is like a rodeo, rodeo, rodeo, rodeo

[Bridge]
You hopped in my Bronco
And we had the time of our life (The time of our life)
We've come a long way since then, girl
But it's been one hell of a ride (One hell of a ride)

[Chorus]
Yeah, love is like a rodeo, tryna see how far we go
After one touch, became obsessed with the rush
Yeah, love is like a rodeo, I just wanna steal the show
We fight and we fall, but we keep holding on
Love is like a rodeo, rodeo, rodeo, rodeo
Love is like a rodeo, rodeo, rodeo, rodeo

[Outro]
I picked you up with a cowboy nod at the hotel bar
It was less than eight seconds, girl, you stole my heart
Rodeo, rodeo, rodeo, rodeo

[Verse 1]
I'm feelin' your vibe, you got my attention
When you walked in here with nobody with ya
Girl if there ain't a guy in the picture, I wanna be
Tell me your story, I'm all ears to listen
Don't spare no details, go on, get specific
I know we just met but I already miss you, honestly

[Chorus]
I don't wanna love you just for one night only
This ain't just a take you home thing
Pick you up and buy you one more, whatever you're drinkin'
That ain't my style, ain't what I'm thinkin'
Thinkin' every morning with you baby, coffee pourin'
Talkin' bring you breakfast in bed
A kiss on your head, again and again
Girl I don't wanna love you just for one night only
I don't wanna love you just for one night only, woo

[Verse 2]
I wanna be your Fridays, baby
And Tuesdays too
24/7 loving up on you
Introduce me to your friends
Wanna shake your daddy's hand
Be your all the time kinda man

[Chorus]
I don't wanna love you just for one night only
This ain't just a take you home thing
Pick you up and buy you one more, whatever you're drinkin'
That ain't my style, ain't what I'm thinkin'
Thinkin' every morning with you baby, coffee pourin'
Talkin' bring you breakfast in bed
A kiss on your head, again and again
Girl I don't wanna love you just for one night only
I don't wanna love you just for one night only, woo

[Bridge]
I'm feelin' your vibe, you got my attention
When you walked in here with nobody with ya
Girl if there ain't a guy in the picture, I wanna be

[Chorus]
But I don't wanna love you just for one night only
This ain't just a take you home thing
Pick you up and buy you one more, whatever you're drinkin'
That ain't my style, ain't what I'm thinkin'
Thinkin' every morning with you baby, coffee pourin'
Talkin' bring you breakfast in bed
A kiss on your head, again and again
Girl I don't wanna love you just for one night only, oh
Yeah, one night only
I don't wanna love you just for one night only
Yeah, one night only

[Verse 1]
Barefoot front porch swingin', here all alone
Tracin' my steps tryna figure out what went wrong
You were here one minute then the next you leave
Now I'm stuck here tryna breathe
Note that says “It ain't you, it's me"

[Chorus]
But it ain't you that's been going through hell
It ain't you with a heart for sale
It ain't you riding 'round this town
With a ghost in the shotgun seat
It ain't you that's been tryna call
It ain't you that still misses it all
You ain't the one that can't move on, still holdin' memories
It ain't you, it's me

[Verse 2]
I found some stuff I just couldn't throw away
Some old T-shirts and pics of us in a frame
I talk to the walls like they feel my pain
'Cause the echo of you is here to stay
I'm just stuck tryna find what it means
It ain't you it's me

[Chorus]
It ain't you that's been going through hell
It ain't you with a heart for sale
It ain't you riding 'round this town
With a ghost in the shotgun seat
It ain't you that's been tryna call
It ain't you that still misses it all
You ain't the one that can't move on, still holdin' memories
It ain't you, it's me

[Chorus]
It ain't you that's been going through hell
It ain't you with a heart for sale
It ain't you riding 'round this town
With a ghost in the shotgun seat
No, it ain't you that's been tryna call
It ain't you that still misses it all
You ain't the one that can't move on, still holdin' memories
It ain't you, it's me
Mm

[Intro]
Learning, learning, learning
Learning, learning, learning

[Verse 1]
When I was six years old, I kinda wet the bed
My stepdad came in and nearly beat me to death
All bruised and broken, I was lonely and scared
My mom, she was working, there was nobody there
My nana showed up, she was super protective
Had a tear in her eye, she saw how I was neglected
The crazy part about it, she's a straight-up detective
But you never would've guessed, at how she'd cook you a breakfast
Three weeks later, she had him locked in a cell
Now I'm seven years old with a story to tell
Sing it

[Chorus]
I'm gonna let it go (Learning, learning)
Forgiveness is something we gotta know (Learning, learning)
'Cause if you hold on forever, it'll hurt your soul
That's why I'm learning how to let it go (Learning, learning)
That's why I'm learning how to let it go

[Verse 2]
Now middle school's here, a new chapter in life
New stepdad too, made my mama his wife
Got new problems now, like tryna fit in
Getting looked down on just because of your skin
It's bad enough, I can't afford them clothes
Got high water's on with holes in my sole
Now, that's the type of stuff to put a hole in your soul
But I, I'm just gonna, I'm just gonna

[Chorus]
I'm gonna let it go (Learning, learning)
Forgiveness is something we gotta know (Learning, learning)
'Cause if you hold on forever, it'll hurt your soul
That's why I'm learning how to let it go (Learning, learning)
That's why I'm learning how to let it go
Let it go (Learning, learning)
Yeah

[Verse 3]
I'm grown up now, I learned enough for a song
Still got some friends (Yeah), but most of 'em gone (They gone)
Overdoses or killed by a gun
Breaking into houses, life on the run
Did it for his kid, now he won't be around
Guess the little one's gonna be just like me now
If you're carrying the bitterness around on your shoulders
Just remember what I told you
Sing it

[Chorus]
I'm gonna let it go (Learning, learning)
Forgiveness is something we gotta know (Learning, learning)
'Cause if you hold on forever, it'll hurt your soul (hurt your soul)
That's why I'm learning how to let it go (Learning, learning)
That's why I'm learning how to let it go (Come on, learning learning)
I'm learning how to let it go

[Intro]
Oh my baby's made for short skirt weather
Yeah, she makes me wish summer would just go on forever
From them yellow polka dots
From blue jeans to leather
Oh my baby's made for short skirt weather
Come on now

[Verse 1]
We'll be walking down the boardwalk
Watching them jaws drop
Ain't nobody lookin' at me
They're all too busy staring at what she ain't wearin'
Can you blame her, it's 100 degrees

[Verse 2]
Yeah all them girls are jealous
'Cause they know all the fellas are watching her put on a show
Yeah every time they see her
They all just wanna be her
Making country boys' hearts explode

[Chorus]
Oh my baby's made for short skirt weather
Yeah, she makes me wish summer would just go on forever
From them yellow polka dots
Blue jeans to leather
Oh my baby's made for short skirt weather
Oh my my
Come on now

[Verse 3]
She get it from her mama
Back in Tullahoma
Small town, Tennessee
She wasn't made for drama
But like Nascar in Daytona
Yeah, that girl was made for me

[Chorus]
Oh my baby's made for short skirt weather
Yeah she makes me wish summer would just go on forever
From them yellow polka dots
Blue jeans to leather
Oh my baby's made for short skirt weather
Woo

[Chorus]
Oh my baby's made for short skirt weather
Yeah, she makes me wish summer would just go on forever
From them yellow polka dots
Blue jeans to leather
Oh my baby's made for short skirt weather

[Chorus]
Oh my baby's made for short skirt weather
Yeah, she makes me wish summer would just go on forever
From them yellow polka dots
From blue jeans to leather
Yeah, my girl was made for short skirt weather
Yellow polka dots
From blue jeans to leather
Oh my baby's made for short skirt weather
Come on now

[Verse 1]
It's 4:30 Friday, I get off at 5:00
I come into your place, you come into mine
Got a bottle of Jack and cheap red wine
Yeah, our own little world
Wanna open em up, close all the doors
Spin you around on that kitchen floor
'Cause all week long, I've been waitin' for
You and me girl

[Chorus]
Just chillin' on the weekend, weekend
Sippin' something on the cheap end, cheap end
Skinny dippin' in the deep end, deep end
Or bass fishin' with your feet in, feet in
Up all night then we sleepin', sleepin'
But we were never really sleepin', sleepin'
Tangled up in the sheets in, sheets in
Goose bumps just a creepin', creepin'
Yeah, we chillin' on the weekend
Just chillin' on the weekend

[Verse 2]
We can watch a whole season of Seinfeld or Friends
While I watch that afternoon sun shining in
Right through the blinds and onto your skin
Yeah, that's something to see
Three days just ain't enough and times ticking
So keep that cherry red lipstick sticking on me
Yeah, let's just keep

[Chorus]
Just chillin' on the weekend, weekend
Sippin' something on the cheap end, cheap end
Skinny dippin' in the deep end, deep end
Or bass fishin' with your feet in, feet in
Up all night then we sleepin', sleepin'
But we were never really sleepin', sleepin'
Tangled up in the sheets in, sheets in
Goose bumps just a creepin', creepin'
Yeah, we chillin' on the weekend
Just chillin' on the weekend, weekend

[Bridge]
Nothing to do, nowhere to be
Nothing to do, nowhere to be
But right here with you and you with me
Right here with you and you with me

[Chorus]
Just chillin' on the weekend (Oh)
Sippin' something on the cheap end (Yeah)
Skinny dippin' in the deep end
Or bass fishin' with your feet in (Oh)
Up all night then we sleepin', sleepin'
But we were never really sleepin', sleepin'
Tangled up in the sheets in, sheets in
Goose bumps just a creepin', creepin'
Yeah, we chillin' on the weekend
Oh yeah, yeah we chillin' on the weekend (Oh)
Just chillin' on the weekend, weekend
Chillin' on the weekend (Weekend, weekend)

[Verse 1:]
There’s no doubt it was always you
From that first time I walked you home from school
Until you stole my heart underneath that August moon
It was always you… it was always you
Now it hurts to see your pretty smile fade
I’ve got a front row seat to watch you drift away
And I know there’s nothing left for us to say
But it’s okay… it’s okay

[Chorus:]
There’s no getting over you
I tried to sugarcoat the truth
But the missing you is tearing me apart
Every kiss that I let slip away
Every minute every single day
The memories make it easy to break a heart
But forgetting… forgetting is the hardest part

[Verse 2:]
Sometimes I sit here feeling like a ghost
Its that emptiness I think that hurts the most
But a piece of me still holds a little hope
I should just let go… but I can’t let go

[Chorus]
There’s no getting over you
I tried to sugarcoat the truth
But the missing you is tearing me apart
Every kiss that I let slip away
Every minute every single day
The memories make it easy to break a heart
But forgetting… forgetting is the hardest part

[Verse 3:]
It’s time to pull myself together
And put these pieces back wherever
Maybe one day I’ll find love again… again

[Chorus]
There’s no getting over you
I've tried to sugarcoat the truth
A million times but I'm still torn apart
Every kiss that I let slip away
Every minute every single day
The memories make it easy to break a heart
But forgetting… forgetting is the hardest part

[Verse 1]
Six months passed since we both said goodbye
Never thought that I'd run into you here tonight
And I can't ever think your smile's the same as it was
Back when I saw you every day
I probably shouldn't say it
What I'm about to say

[Chorus]
We could make a comeback if you come back
We were on top of the world, people wanted what we had
We could have it again don't you know that
We could make a comeback if you come back

[Verse 2]
You haven't stopped me yet so I guess I'll keep going on
Oh, and I haven't even deleted your number from my phone
I've been wanting to call you every single day
But I couldn't think how to rephrase everything
So just tell me, babe
If you feel the same way

[Chorus]
We could make a comeback if you come back
We were on top of the world
People wanted what we had
We could have it again don't you know that
We could make a comeback if you come back
We could make a comeback if you just come back
We could make a comeback if you come back
We were on top of the world, people wanted what we had
We could have it again don't you know that
We could make a comeback if you come back

[Outro]
Six months passed since we both said goodbye

[Verse 1]
Old Mr. Jackson cuts his grass after church on his tractor
Only after listening to the country countdown
He remembers all the three cord sessions
Givin' lessons, never guessin'
We'd go from dive bars to sold out
He just smiles, can’t help but grin when he turns that dial on the FM
Hears an old friend, he can’t believe it
Ain’t that what it’s all about?
What it’s all about, yeah

[Chorus]
All I wanna do is make my hometown proud
Make 'em turn it up loud
Roll them windows down
All I wanna do is make my hometown proud
Gonna give 'em that sound
Everybody’s talkin' about
We still them same old, same old southern boys
Still got that same old, same old southern voice
We’re singin' now
All I wanna do is make my hometown proud
Make my hometown proud
Make my hometown proud

[Verse 2]
All the whining through the years
All the grindin' of the gears
All the passion and the tears
Man, it paid off
All the places that we see
All the people that we meet
It still feels like a dream that we’re living on
It ain’t the lights and fame
It ain’t the smoke and flame
It’s that sweet hearted smile on my mama’s face

[Chorus]
All I wanna do is make my hometown proud
Make 'em turn it up loud
Roll them windows down
All I wanna do is make my hometown proud
Gonna give 'em that sound
Everybody’s talking about
We still them same old, same old southern boys
Still got that same old, same old southern voice
We’re singing now
All I wanna do is make my hometown proud
Make my hometown proud
Make my hometown proud

[Guitar Solo]

[Bridge]
In every song
Every way
In every move I'd ever made
That’s right, North West Georgia, where you all at?
In every song
In every way
Every move I’ve ever made
Chattanooga, Tennessee, turn it up
Come on

[Chorus]
All I wanna do is make my hometown proud
Make 'em turn it up loud
Roll them windows down
All I wanna do is make my hometown proud
Gonna give 'em that sound
Everybody’s talking about
We still them same old, same old southern boys
Still got that same old, same old southern voice
We’re singing now
All I wanna do is make my hometown proud
Make my hometown proud
Make my hometown proud

[Outro]
Old Mr. Jackson cuts his grass after church on his tractor
Only after listening to the country countdown

[Chorus]
Baby come back to me
Give me one more chance
One more chance to be, to be a better man
This don't have to be goodbye
Don't do this to me tonight
Just come back to me
Yeah, baby come back to me

[Verse 1]
Don't make this bed get colder
Don't make me sleep alone
Don't make me burn our picture
Don't make me hate our song
Don't keep me goin' crazy
Climbin' up these walls
Don't you keep me up all night
Waitin' for your call

[Chorus]
Baby come back to me
Give me one more chance
One more chance to be, to be a better man
This don't have to be goodbye
Don't do this to me tonight
Just come back to me
Baby come back to me

[Verse 2]
Don't you go get lonely
Don't put on that dress
Don't go goin' downtown
Don't go turnin' heads
Just think about the good times
And everything we had
Don't go throwin' that away
I need you so damn bad

[Chorus]
Baby come back to me
Give me one more chance
One more chance to be, to be a better man
This don't have to be goodbye
Don't do this to me tonight
Just come back to me
Yeah, baby come back to me
Woo

[Bridge]
Don't make this bed get colder
Don't make me sleep alone

[Chorus]
Baby come back to me
Give me one more chance
One more chance to be, to be a better man
This don't have to be goodbye
Don't do this to me tonight
Just come back to me
Yeah, baby come back to me
Just come back to me
Yeah, come back to me
Come back to me
Come back to me

[Verse 1]
Your lips, your eyes, don't wanna let go
Your skin on mine, I'm losing control
Hear the rumble in your chest
Feel the wind comin' off your breath
Your curves ain't slowin' me down
Ain't nothin' gonna stop us now

[Chorus]
You're fire, I'm lightnin'
We're burnin' at the core
Fallin' and crashin'
Girl, we're a perfect storm
Every time our hearts collide
I can feel our love come to life
It's insane, baby
We're like thunder in the rain

[Verse 2]
Twisted, tangled like a hurricane
We shake these walls like an earthquake
Hear the rumble in your chest
Feel the wind comin' off your breath
The way you're callin' out my name
Makes me hard to contain

[Chorus]
You're fire, I'm lightnin'
We're burnin' at the core
Fallin' and crashin'
Girl, we're a perfect storm
Every time our hearts collide
I can feel our love come to life
It's insane, baby
We're like thunder in the rain
We're like thunder in the rain

[Bridge]
You're fire, I'm lightnin'
We're burnin' at the core
Fallin' and crashin'
Girl, we're a perfect storm

[Chorus]
You're fire, I'm lightnin'
We're burnin' at the core
Fallin' and crashin'
Girl, we're a perfect storm
Every time our hearts collide
I can feel our love come to life
It's insane, baby
We're like thunder in the rain
We're like thunder in the rain

[Verse 1]
We take a drive just to sing along
Every word of them Rolling Stones
Stacy's mom had it going on
Lived three doors down I can see her now
Her daughter had a heart that was wild and free
If you blink-182 then you'd miss me and her
Every verse had a story
Yeah, them pocket lighter nights lit up our days of glory

[Chorus]
Back when the air guitars were the only sound
And you'd strum the chords and I'd put the pedal down
Two-man dashboard band rollin' through this town
Had that rearview shakin' to the kickdrum beat
Leaning West Coast deep in the bucket seats
All I ever wanted was right there in that car
Back when we were rockstars
(Yeah, we were runnin' all night, chasing down a dream, howling at the moon, baby, you and me)
Back when we were rockstars
(Yeah, we were runnin' all night, chasing down a dream, howling at the moon, baby, you and me)

[Verse 2]
Nothin' like freedom two windows down
You singin' along still hear it now
Way too loud and sometimes off key
But you sounded like an angel to me
You'd make fun of how I threw my head
Threw my fingers up in the air
Thought I was Kurt Cobain or Jimmy Page
You were side seat center stage

[Chorus]
Back when the air guitars were the only sound
And you'd strum the chords and I'd put the pedal down
Two-man dashboard band rollin' through this town
Had that rearview shakin' to the kickdrum beat
Leaning West Coast deep in the bucket seats
All I ever wanted was right there in that car
Back when we were rockstars
Back when we were rockstars

[Bridge]
We never ended up on MTV
Or heard our voices on a CD
But in your eyes and in my arms
We were each other's rockstar

[Chorus]
Back when the air guitars were the only sound
And you'd strum the chords and I'd put the pedal down
Two-man dashboard band rollin' through this town
Had that rearview shakin' to the kickdrum beat
Leaning West Coast deep in the bucket seats
All I ever wanted was right there in that car
Back when we were rockstars
(Yeah, we were runnin' all night, chasing down a dream, howling at the moon, baby, you and me)
Yeah, back when we were rockstars
(Yeah, we were runnin' all night, chasing down a dream, howling at the moon, baby, you and me)
Back when we were rockstars
(Yeah, we were runnin' all night, chasing down a dream, howling at the moon, baby, you and me)
You and me were rockstars
(Yeah, we were runnin' all night, chasing down a dream, howling at the moon, baby, you and me)
Oh yeah

[Outro]
Yeah, we were runnin' all night
Chasing down a dream
Howling at the moon
Baby, you and me

Everything, everything, everything...

I watch her every morning
Putting on her make up
That girl comes without a warning
So addicting, I can’t get enough
She gets dressed for work, grabs her keys then she leaves
Yeah that goodbye kiss kills me

There goes my everything
My everything
My all, my love for sure
She’s everything I want and need
And then she's even more
When I see her face I can’t help but think
There goes my everything

Everything, everything, everything...

Everytime we’re in a party
I still watch her from across the room
I ain’t notice everybody
They can’t even help but watch her too
Dressed up or dressed down
And she can’t help but shine
I can’t believe she’s mine

There goes my everything
My everything
My all, my love for sure
She’s everything I want and need
And then she's even more
When I see her face I can’t help but think
There goes my everything

There goes my everything

Everything, everything, everything...

I watch her every morning
Putting on her make up

There goes my everything
My everything
My all, my love for sure
She’s everything I want and need
And then she's even more
When I see her face I can’t help but think
There goes my everything

There goes my everything

[Verse 1]
I remember you in that rocking chair
I was in my boots and my underwear
Playing rodeo all night long
You used to count till it hit 8 seconds
When you hit 6 is the time you left us
But you're in my heart so I'll never be alone
I know you're watching over me

[Chorus]
I hope one day I'll be the man you used to be
Quick to love and slow to anger
No, you never met a stranger
I hope one day when you're looking down on me
I make you smile
I make you proud
I may not be there now
But I hope one day I'll be man enough to be sitting there in my granddaddy's chair

[Verse 2]
You were 8 track, tapes and Conway Twitty
Road trip with Nana to Panama City
Everybody knew she was your girl
You taught me love
You taught me living
Cars and jokes and good catfishing
I gave you hell and you gave me the world
I'm sure missing you right now

[Chorus]
I hope one day I'll be the man you used to be
Quick to love and slow to anger
No, you never met a stranger
I hope one day when you're looking down on me
I make you smile
I make you proud
I may not be there now
But I hope one day I'll be man enough to be sitting there in my granddaddy's chair
My granddaddy's chair

[Chorus]
Yeah, I hope one day when you're looking down on me
I make you smile
I make you proud
I may not be there now
But I hope one day I'll be man enough to be sitting there in my granddaddy's chair
Oh yeah
In my granddaddy's chair

[Outro]
Rest in peace, I love you granddaddy

[Verse 1]
It could be a black dress
High heels
Ripped up, torn up Lucky jeans
Or the covers in the morning
Her boyshorts and my favorite tee
Unbuttoned flannel layin' on the floor
Lingerie hangin' on the back of the door
I swear it don't matter what it is

[Chorus]
She puts it on like it was made for her
The kind of thing you can't teach or learn
She puts it on on a Friday night
Everything she does, she does just right
It won't take long 'til you can't say no
She walks in she's gonna steal the show
She puts it on and on and on and on
'Cause she knows she can pull it off
Oh yeah

[Verse 2]
The way she wears my flatbill way better than me
Got me wanting everything underneath
Those blue eyes lookin' back at me
Looks like that can change everything
I swear

[Chorus]
She puts it on like it was made for her
The kind of thing you can't teach or learn
She puts it on on a Friday night
Everything she does, she does just right
It won't take long 'til you can't say no
She walks in she's gonna steal the show
She puts it on and on and on and on
'Cause she knows she can pull it off
Yeah she knows she can pull it off

[Bridge]
Unbuttoned flannel layin' on the floor
Lingerie hangin' on the back of the door
I swear it don't matter what it is

[Chorus]
She puts it on like it was made for her
The kind of thing you don't teach or learn
She puts it on on a Friday night
Everything she does, she does it right
It won't take long 'til you can't say no
She walks in she's gonna steal the show
She puts it on and on and on and on
'Cause she knows she can pull it off
Yeah she knows she can pull it off
'Cause she knows she can pull it off
Yeah, she puts it on and on and on and on
'Cause she knows she can pull it off

[Intro]
We'll be road-tripping
Rolling with the top down
South bound
Little bikinis in white sand

[Verse 1]
I can't sleep, gotta leave
The summer sun is starting to peak
Through my window, lettin' me know
Time's up, it's time that we go
Got a lead foot waiting
And a pocket full of cash
Cooler full of beer
And a little something stashed
In the back of the car, so relax
There ain't a beach too far

[Chorus]
We'll be road-tripping
Rolling with the top down
South bound
Little bikinis in white sand
In a tank top
Gonna let the guns out, all about
Rocking that farmer's tan
Got the Chev going 70
All the girls looking heavenly
Buncha kick back and chill
Out ahead of me
Gettin' wild, raisin' hell
And leavin' this town
Like there ain't no stopping us now

[Verse 2]
Oh tellin', no tellin'
Bet them lips taste like watermelon
Got that Daiquiri kiss
The kind when it hits
Makes you wanna get goin' there
Wherever that is

[Chorus x2]
We'll be road-tripping
Rolling with the top down
South bound
Little bikinis in white sand (hell yeah!)
In a tank top
Gonna let the guns out, all about
Rocking that farmer's tan
Got the Chev going 70
All the girls looking heavenly
Buncha kick back and chill
Out ahead of me
Gettin' wild, raisin' hell
And leavin' this town
Like there ain't no stopping us now
No, there ain't no stopping us now
There ain't no stopping us now

[Outro]
(Road-tripping
Rolling with the top down
South bound
Little bikinis in white sand)
No there ain't no stopping us now
(In a tank top
Gonna let the guns out, all about
Rocking that farmer's tan)
There ain't no stopping us now
(Got the Chev going 70
All the girls looking heavenly
Buncha kick back and chill
Out ahead of me)
No, there ain't no stopping us now
(Gettin' wild and leavin' this town)
There ain't no stopping us now

[Verse 1]
They say don't go to bed angry
They say always kiss goodnight
Maybe there's somethin' to it
I don't know, but what if they're right
If we're gonna be forever
If it's gonna be just us
If we're gonna ride together
Turn two to one

[Chorus]
Gotta make it work, I'm not sayin' it's easy
Sometimes we get hurt, I promise I ain't leavin', yeah
There's gonna be a couple fights
Just to see who's wrong or right
If it's love we both know what it's gonna take
Work
Yeah, we can make it work

[Verse 2]
I've seen the things that happen
One side self destructs
I've seen the beautiful madness
When things erupt

[Chorus]
Gotta make it work, I'm not sayin' it's easy
Sometimes we get hurt, I promise I ain't leavin', yeah
There's gonna be a couple fights
Just to see who's wrong or right
If it's love we both know what it's gonna take
Work
Yeah, we can make it work

[Bridge]
Can't always be there for ya
Can't always be by your side
But I promise that I'm gon' love ya
'Til the day I die
'Til the day I die

[Chorus]
Gotta make it work, I'm not sayin' it's easy
Sometimes we get hurt, I promise I ain't leavin', yeah
There's gonna be a couple fights
Just to see who's wrong or right
If it's love we both know what it's gonna take
Work
Oh no, yeah, we can make it work

[Verse 1]
She throws her Braves cap on her head
Every time it rains
And when her favorite song comes on
She sings out of key as it plays
Always leaving the car on empty
And blaming me for what she did
But when we talk about our future
Or the name of our first kid

[Chorus]
It’s kind of crazy what turns me on
How she’s always blowing up my phone
It’s not some cover girl on a magazine
It’s the one I fell in love with at 17
An addictive drug that pulled me in
Not them long tan legs or perfect ten
It’s the imperfections that she wants gone
It’s kinda crazy what turns me on

[Verse 2]
I love to give her silent treatment
When she throws her little fits
Thinking she’s gonna get her way
As she pokes out her bottom lip
When she makes her funny faces
And does her best British accent
When she says she’s not hungry
And then I get mine and she digs in

[Chorus]
It’s kind of crazy what turns me on
How she's always blowing up my phone
It’s not some cover girl on a magazine
It’s the one I fell in love with at 17
An addictive drug that pulled me in
Not them long tan legs or perfect ten
It’s the imperfections that she wants gone
It’s kinda crazy what turns me on

[Outro]
It turns me on
An addictive drug that pulled me in
Not them long tan legs or perfect ten
It’s the imperfections that she wants gone
It’s kinda crazy but turns me on
Yeah eh yeah
Oh it turns me on
Yeah it turns me on

[Verse 1]
Money in the bank, gas in the tank
Say you wanna get a little crazy
Your hands up on my knees, such a little tease
I'm acting like it ain't gonna phase me
Girl tonight the world is ours
Shooting like some southern stars
From the backseat down a backstreet of your heart

[Chorus]
Ridin' these FM waves
Burnin' these reckless days
I can't wait to get a taste
So get a little close, a little closer
Float in these country roads
Tearin' off each other's clothes
Heads back, curl up them toes
And get a little closer, a little closer

[Verse 2]
Waylon in truck, whiskey in this cup
Dancing with your back up on the console
Brush your hair back from your eyes
Put your fingertips in mine
Girl, pull me back until tomorrow
Set the evening sky on fire
Burning up with that desire
From the backseat down a backstreet in your heart

[Chorus]
Ridin' these FM waves
Burnin' these reckless days
I can't wait to get a taste
So get a little close, a little closer
Float in these country roads
Tearin' off each other's clothes
Heads back, curl up them toes
And get a little closer, a little closer

[Chorus]
Ridin' these FM waves
Burnin' these reckless days
I can't wait to get a taste
So get a little close, a little closer
Float in these country roads
Tearin' off each other's clothes
Heads back, curl up them toes
And get a little closer, a little closer

[Verse 1]
Remember when ninth grade was about gettin' laid
Skippin' class tryin' not to get caught?
Now you gotta take a test in a bullet proof vest
Scared to death that you might get shot
It's like I just closed my eyes
Everybody started fallin' for the Devil's disguise
That hides behind the lines
That hide the truth and I just can't take it no more

[Chorus]
So wake me up from this American bad dream
Is it this messed up, or is it really reality?
I'm becomin' numb to all of this tragedy
Somebody wake me up from this American bad dream
From this American bad dream

[Verse 2]
I remember goin' 10 over the limit would just get you a ticket
Just an inconvenience gettin' stopped
Bad cops played the jury, made the good ones worry
About showin' up and doin' their job
It's like I just closed my eyes
Everybody started fallin' for the Devil's disguise
That hides behind the lines
That hide the truth now I just can't take it no more

[Chorus]
So wake me up from this American bad dream
Is it this messed up, or is it really reality?
I'm becomin' numb to all of this tragedy
Somebody wake me up from this American bad dream
Yeah this American bad dream
From this American bad dream, oh

[Bridge]
It's like I just closed my eyes
Everybody started fallin' for the Devil's disguise
Damn

[Chorus]
So wake me up from this American bad dream
Is it this messed up, or is it really reality?
I'm becomin' numb to all of this tragedy
Somebody wake me up from this American bad dream
From this American bad dream
Wake me up, wake me up
Wake me up from this American bad dream
From this American bad dream

[Verse 1]
A cement building
White cinderblocks
And faded red letters
The sign read "cold spot"
He worked behind the counter
To them he was an old man
When my world was crumbling
My grandpa gave me his hand

[Chorus]
It was crickets, minnows and kerosene
RC, moon pies and a softball team
Learned about life
Learned about girls
Learned about livin' in this cold, cruel world
It's where you bought your tag for your white-tailed deer
Where the southern baptist bought the most beer
A hole in the wall with holes in the wall
From behind this counter you saw it all
At the cold spot

[Verse 2]
It was cool in July, warm in December
If I live a hundred years, I'll always remember
The song and the hum to that old ceiling fan
And his north Georgia voice saying, "Buddy, you can"
Out here, I'm just a kid trying to make a name
I am who I am because he raised Kane, selling

[Chorus]
Crickets and minnows and kerosene
RC, moon pies and a softball team
Learned about life
Learned about girls
Learned about livin' in this cold, cruel world
It's where you bought your tag for your white-tailed deer
Where the southern baptist bought the most beer
A hole in the wall with holes in the wall
From behind this counter you saw it all
At the cold spot
Oh yeah
At the cold spot

[Chorus]
It was crickets, minnows and kerosene
RC, moon pies and a softball team
Learned about life
Learned about girls
Learned about livin' in this cold, cruel world
It was heaven on earth when my world was hell
And the big stores came and the business failed
But all my memories are alive and well
At the cold spot
Oh yeah
At the cold spot
Take me back to the cold spot

[Verse 1:]
Driving down on back roads
Skipping down on traffic
Flipping through the radio
All I get is static
I don’t mind the quiet
I guess I kind of like it
Better nothing at all
Than the sound of us crying

[Chorus:]
You said you didn’t mean it
But it’s still in my head
I learned it’s no easier
To forgive and forget
We thought it was forever
Look at us now
Well I tried
And I lost more than I found

[Verse 2:]
Sitting by the window waiting for your headlights
Been two damn days since you said goodbye
I was feeling lonely feeling like I made a mistake
Though I never forgive myself for your heart break

[Chorus:]
I said I didn’t mean it
But it’s still in your head
I’ve learned it’s no easier
To forgive than forget
We thought it was forever
Look at us now
Well I tried
And I lost more than I found

[Bridge:]
Baby you can’t explain
No don’t say anything please
No it’s too late

[Chorus:]
You said you didn’t mean it
I said I didn’t mean it
I learned it’s no easier
To forgive and forget
We thought it was forever
Look at us now
Well I tried
And I lost more than I found

[Verse 1: Kane Brown & Chris Young]
10 P.M., most folks are sleeping
But it's the weekend
So we ain't, and we know where the cows don't go
These 40 inch tires seen enough pavement
So we're taking them on red dirt place somewhere offroad
You won't find us at no bar
I'll tell you right where we are

[Chorus: Both]
No where, no rules
Crack a Bud Light, get into the groove
Dancing in the middle of the night in the middle of a field
Just turning it loose
Hell yeah, that's us
Don't need a downtown to get to tearing it up
Round here, just watching the stars get bright
Setting the night on fire, on fire, on fire
Setting the night on fire, on fire, on fire

[Verse 2: Kane Brown & Chris Young]
Girls showing up late as always
Now it's a party
Cut off sun dresses, they're ready to go
Don't need no dance road tonight
Just country music and good times

[Chorus: Both]
No where, no rules
Crack a Bud Light, get into the groove
Dancing in the middle of the night in the middle of a field
Just turning it loose
Hell yeah, that's us
Don't need a downtown to get to tearing it up
Out here just watching the stars get bright
Setting the night on fire, on fire, on fire
Setting the night on fire (on fire), on fire (on fire), on fire (on fire)

[Bridge: Kane Brown & Chris Young]
You won't find us at no bar
I'll tell you right where we are

[Chorus: Both]
No where, no rules
Crack a Bud Light, get into the groove
Dancing in the middle of the night in the middle of a field
Just turning it loose
Hell yeah, that's us
Don't need a downtown to get to tearing it up
Out here, just watching the stars get bright
Setting the night on fire (on fire), on fire (on fire), on fire (on fire)
Setting the night on fire (on fire), on fire (on fire), on fire (on fire)
Yeah
Setting the night on fire

[Outro: Chris Young]
On fire

[Verse 1]
There's a few more churches than there are bars
A hell of a lot more trucks than there are cars
If the sun’s still hangin' in the sky
Work day still ain't done
Where I come from

[Verse 2]
You bow your head and pray before you eat
There ain’t a single stranger on the streets
There's a lot of nowhere towns out there
But for me there's only one
Where I come from

[Chorus 1]
So if I just won't turn down on a Saturday night
And if I never learn how to back down from a fight
And if I take my hat off for the stars and the stripes
And If I just can't seem to shut it down
That's just my "where I come from" comin' out

[Verse 3]
When I shake your hand I'm gonna look you in the eye
And if I’m wrong, I’ll apologize
I'm still tryin’ to live by a couple things I pick up
Where I come from

[Chorus 2]
So if I like my music just a little too loud
And I got a couple tattoos to show my Georgia pride
And if what's on my mind is what's comin' out my mouth
And If I just can’t seem to shut it down
That's just my "where I come from" comin' out

[Bridge]
Got a lot of good, got a little bit of bad from it
Made me what I am, got everything I have from it

[Chorus 1]
So if I just won't turn down on a Saturday night
And if I never learn how to back down from a fight
And if I take my hat off for the stars and the stripes
And If I just can't seem to shut it down
That's just my "where I come from" comin' out
"Where I come from" comin' out

[Verse 1]
Always stayin' out late, get off at 8
But you come to door at 3
Name on your phone says caller unknown
But girl you ain't foolin' me
I can see it in your eyes and all the shh you hide

[Chorus]
All your excuses, they're always in the way
Do you think that I'm stupid, make a new one everyday
But you can't lie, girl I ain't blind
If love is just a game you play, well then you're losin'
Stupid excuses

[Verse 2]
Say you're out with your friends, try to pretend
Like I don't know what you're doing
It's funny to me, the joke is on you
And girl I see through it

[Chorus]
All your excuses, they're always in the way
Do you think that I'm stupid, make a new one everyday
But you can't lie, girl I ain't blind
If love is just a game you play, well then you're losin'
Stupid excuses

All your excuses, they're always in the way
Do you think that I'm stupid
Girl you ain't foolin' me

All your excuses, they're always in the way
Do you think that I'm stupid, make a new one everyday
But you can't lie, girl I ain't blind
If love is just a game you play, well then you're losin'
Stupid excuses

Just a slow down small town
Just a deep south home crowd
With nothing to do and nothing to lose
The same old paper and same old news

We'd ride around 10:30 on a Friday
We'd hurry to a parkin lot
With all our friends
Turning up the heat when
We finally made it to the weekend

We put the gas to the floor
Yeah, we hit it wide open
Two-lane highway rolling
With no one around, slowing us down
Radio loud, had the speakers all blowing
Dials wide open
Feet on the dash with her hand out the window
Smiling a look in her eye letting me know
She didn't care where we were going
As long as we were going wide open

She was made for the fast lane
She was more than just a pretty face
First time lover, we spent that summer
Doing nothing but getting away

We put the gas to the floor
Yeah, we hit it wide open
Two-lane highway rolling
With no one around, slowing us down
Radio loud, had the speakers all blowing
Dials wide open
Feet on the dash with her hand out the window
Smiling a look in her eye letting me know
She didn't care where we were going
As long as we were going wide open

We put the gas to the floor
Yeah, we hit it wide open
Two-lane highway rolling
With no one around, slowing us down
Radio loud, had the speakers all blowing
Dials wide open
Feet on the dash with her hand out the window
Smiling a look in her eye letting me know
She didn't care where we were going
As long as we were going wide open

(Just a slow down small town)
Wide open
(Just a deep south home crowd)
She didn't care where we were going
As long as we were going wide open
Wide open

[Verse 1]
I know it's late to be callin', whatcha doin' right now?
I couldn't wait, til tomorrow, to get to takin' you out
I gotta see you girl ASAP, I gotta get you right here next to me
Getcha right here next to me

[Chorus]
On a last minute, late night, date night
Me holdin' you tight, til the break of dawn
Little midnight, kissin' and red wine sippin'
And listenin' to the crickets singin' love songs
Little moonlight shinning in your eyes
Hitting 'em just right, girl we can't go wrong
On a last minute, late night, date night
Me holdin' you tight, til the break of dawn. Come on
Come on
Come on
Oh girl come on
Come on
Come on

[Verse 2]
I'm on my way, in a hurry, I'll be there in five
It's okay, don't you worry, I know your lookin' so fine
In that bulldog t-shirt, hair pulled back
You know I love it when you lookin' like that
You know I love it when you lookin' like that

[Chorus]
On a last minute, late night, date night
Me holdin' you tight, til the break of dawn
Little midnight, kissin' and red wine sippin
And listenin' to the crickets singin' love songs
Little moonlight shinning in your eyes
Hitting 'em just right, girl we can't go wrong
On a last minute, late night, date night
Me holdin' you tight, til the break of dawn
Come on
Come on
Come on
Oh girl come on
Come on
Come on

[Bridge]
Girl, I, know, this, might sound crazy, but, I, can't, help, it
When I'm crazy for you baby, ain't playin' when I'm sayin'

[Chorus]
We're having a last minute, late night, date night
Me holdin' you tight, til the break of dawn
Little midnight, kissin' and red wine sippin'
And listenin' to the crickets singin' love songs
Little moonlight shinning in your eyes, hitting 'em just right, girl we can't go wrong
On a last minute, late night, date night
Me holdin' you tight, til the break of dawn
Come on
Come on
Come on
Oh girl come on
Come on, come on
Oh girl come on, come on, come on
On a last minute, late night, date night
Me holdin you tight, til the break of dawn

[Verse 1]
I remember you in that jacked up jeep
Hair blowing sipping Mickey D's sweet tea
Cheap sunglasses and paisley boots
Long tan legs and those daisy dukes
Stopping for every single yard sale sign
What I wouldn't give to do that one more time

[Chorus]
Don't go city on me
Please girl keep it country
Life's so different since you cross those tracks
Bring that pretty little accent back
Don't go city on me
Come on keep it country
With your fancy bling and you're miss me jeans
The girl I knew wouldn't need those things
Don't go city on me, don't go city on me

[Verse 2]
Never knew what city lights looked like
From the bed of a truck on a summer night sky
Traffic jams on a gravel road
Don't you miss our old blue hole?
You climbed up on that rock and you held my hand
So I'm gonna say this once again

[Chorus]
Don't go city on me
Please girl keep it country
Life's so different since you crossed those tracks
Bring that pretty little accent back
Don't go city on me
Come on keep it country
With your fancy bling and you're miss me jeans
The girl I knew wouldn't need those things
Don't go city on, don't go city on me

Ohhhhhhh

[Bridge]
You threw me that key, gave me one last kiss
Said girl it don't have to end like this

[Chorus]
Don't go city on me
Please girl keep it country
Life's so different since you crossed those tracks
Bring that pretty little accent back
Don't go city on me
Come on keep it country
With your fancy bling and you're miss me jeans
The girl I knew wouldn't need those things
Don't go

Baby

Don't go, noooo

[Outro]
Don't go city on me
Don't go, keep it country

[Verse 1]
Baby, last night was hands down
One of the best nights that I've had, no doubt
Between the bottle of wine and the look in your eyes and the Marvin Gaye
Then we danced in the dark under September stars in the pourin' rain

[Pre-Chorus]
And I know that I can't ever tell you enough
That all I need in this life is your crazy love

[Chorus 1]
If I never get to see the Northern Lights
Or if I never get to see the Eiffel Tower at night
Oh, if all I got is your hand in my hand
Baby, I could die a happy man
A happy man, baby, mmm

[Verse 2]
Baby, that red dress brings me to my knees
Oh, but that black dress makes it hard to breathe
You’re a saint, you’re a goddess, the cutest, the hottest, a masterpiece
It's too good to be true, nothing better than you in my wildest dreams

[Pre-Chorus]
And I know that I can't ever tell you enough
That all I need in this life is your crazy love

[Chorus 1]
If I never get to see the Northern Lights
Or if I never get to see the Eiffel Tower at night
Oh, if all I got is your hand in my hand
Baby, I could die a happy man, yeah, yeah
Mmm

[Bridge]
I don't need no vacation, no fancy destination
Baby, you're my great escape
We could stay at home, listen to the radio
Dance around the fireplace

[Chorus 2]
Oh, if I never get to build my mansion in Georgia
Or drive a sports car up the coast of California
Oh, if all I got is your hand in my hand
Baby, I could die a happy man

[Post-Chorus]
Baby, I could die a happy man
Oh, I could die a happy man
You know I could, girl
I could die, I could die a happy man
Mmm

[Verse 1]
She wants to get married, she wants it perfect
She wants her granddaddy preaching the service
And she wants magnolias out in the country
Not too many people, save her daddy some money

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Ooh, she got it all planned out
Yeah, I can see it all right now

[Chorus 1]
I'll wear my black suit, black tie, hide out in the back
I'll do a strong shot of whiskey straight out the flask
I'll try to make it through without crying so nobody sees
Yeah, she wanna get married
But she don't wanna marry me

[Verse 2]
I remember the night when I almost kissed her
Yeah, I kinda freaked out, we've been friends for forever
And I'd always wonder if she felt the same way
When I got the invite, I knew it was too late

[Pre-Chorus 2]
And I know her daddy's been dreading this day
Oh, but he don't know he ain't the only one giving her away

[Chorus 1]
I'll wear my black suit, black tie, hide out in the back
I'll do a strong shot of whiskey straight out the flask
I'll try to make it through without crying so nobody sees
Yeah, she wanna get married
But she don't wanna marry me

[Bridge]
Bet she got on her dress now, welcoming the guests now
I could try to find her, get it off of my chest now
But I ain't gonna mess it up, so I wish her the best now

[Chorus 2]
So I'm in my black suit, black tie, hiding out in the back
Doing a strong shot of whiskey straight out the flask
I'll try to make it through without crying so nobody sees
Yeah, she wanna get married
Yeah, she gonna get married
But she ain't gonna marry me
Whoa, but she ain't gonna marry me, no

[Verse 1]
Waking up in my college dorm
Yeah, my life, it was pretty normal
Looking for a date to the spring formal
Wasn't worried 'bout nothing else, no
Majoring in Undecided
Notebook full of bad songs I was writing
Never dreamed anybody else would like them
Now they're sitting on a Walmart shelf

[Chorus]
Ain't it funny how life changes
You wake up, ain't nothing the same and life changes
You can't stop it, just hop on the train, and
You never know what's gonna happen
You make your plans and you hear God laughing
Life changes, and I wouldn't change it for the world, the world, oh no
And I wouldn't change it for the world, the world, oh no

[Verse 2]
I bought a ring and she said, "I do"
But everybody else said, "Man, you're twenty-two
Whatcha trying to prove? Hey, why don't you wait?"
'Cause I've been waiting on her since the second grade, yeah
And now she got her own set of fans
She got a blue check mark by her Instagram
And I wrote a little song about holding her hand
And now everybody wanna die a happy man

[Chorus]
Ain't it funny how life changes
You wake up ain't nothing the same and life changes
You can't stop it just hop on the train, and
You never know what's gonna happen
You make your plans and you hear God laughing
Life changes, and I wouldn't change it for the world, the world, oh no
And I wouldn't change it for the world, the world, oh no

[Verse 3]
I remember the day I told my Daddy and Mama
"You're gonna have a grandkid, yep
From Uganda, that's right, we're adopting
And she is the cutest little girl that you've ever seen"
Well I was wrapping my head around being a dad
A big wrench got thrown in the plans we thought we had
Now Lauren's showing, got one on the way
Yeah that's two under two, hey, what can I say?

[Chorus]
Ain't it funny how life changes
You wake up ain't nothing the same and life changes
You can't stop it, just hop on the train, and
You never know what's gonna happen
You make your plans and you hear God laughing
Life changes, and I wouldn't change it for the world, the world, oh no
And I wouldn't change it for the world, the world, oh no

[Verse 1: Thomas Rhett]
Every time we have to say goodbye
I'm counting down until we say hello
Every touch is like the strongest drug
I don't know how much longer I can go

[Pre-Chorus: Thomas Rhett]
I never had something that I can't walk away from
But, girl, my self-control's so paralyzed
When it comes to you, no, I ain't got no patience
There's something 'bout you girl I just can't fight

[Chorus: Thomas Rhett & Maren Morris]
You're like that cigarette
That shot of 100 proof
No matter how much I get
I'm always craving
That feeling when we kiss
The way your body moves
No matter how much I get
I'm always craving you
Craving you

[Verse 2: Thomas Rhett]
All the in-between is killing me
You know I come unglued from missing you
Sunset eyes, no, I don't have to try
Because you know exactly what to do

[Pre-Chorus: Thomas Rhett & Maren Morris]
I never had something that I can't walk away from (walk away from)
But, girl, my self-control's so paralyzed
When it comes to you, no, I ain't got no patience (I ain't got no patience)
There's something 'bout you I just can't fight

[Chorus: Thomas Rhett & Maren Morris]
You're like that cigarette
That shot of 100 proof
No matter how much I get
I'm always craving
That feeling when we kiss
The way your body moves
No matter how much I get
I'm always craving you
Craving you

[Post Chorus: Thomas Rhett & Maren Morris]
I'm always craving you
Craving you
Craving you

[Bridge: Thomas Rhett & Maren Morris]
Every time we have to say goodbye
I'm counting down until we say hello
Every touch is like the strongest drug
I don't know how much longer I can go

[Chorus: Thomas Rhett & Maren Morris]
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)
You're like that cigarette
That shot of 100 proof
No matter how much I get
I'm always craving
That feeling when we kiss
The way your body moves
No matter how much I get
I'm always craving you, yeah
Craving you

[Post Chorus: Thomas Rhett & Maren Morris]
Craving you
I'm craving you baby
I'm craving you
I'm craving you babe

[Verse 1]
It was the 14th of October
Had that t-shirt off your shoulder
I was drunk, said I was sober
And you said yeah right
We were talkin’ for a minute
Then some guy tried to cut in
You took my hand and we pretended
Like I was your guy

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, then I tried to guess your middle name
For 30 minutes bet we played that game

[Chorus 1]
That mango-rita you were drinkin’
And that Coldplay song that you were singin’
And I bet right now you’re probably thinkin’
That it’s crazy I remember every detail, but I do
From your blue jeans to your shoes
Girl, that night was just like you
Unforgettable

[Verse 2]
We were dancin’, we were buzzin’
Takin’ shots like it was nothin’
Did the runnin’ man, you loved it
Yeah, you laughed out loud
You brushed away your blonde hair
And you kissed me out of nowhere
I can still show you the spot
Where everything went down

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, I told you I was gonna marry you
You probably didn’t think that it was true

[Chorus 2]
That mango-rita you were drinkin’
And that Coldplay song that you were singin’
And I bet right now you’re probably thinkin’
That it’s crazy I remember every detail, but I do
I can still smell your perfume
Girl, that night was just like you
Unforgettable

[Bridge]
Oh, that night was just like you, baby
I can taste the mango-rita you were drinkin’
And it feels just like it was last weekend
That we jumped in
Right off the deep end

[Chorus 2]
That mango-rita you were drinkin’
And that Coldplay song that you were singin’
And I bet right now you’re probably thinkin’
That it’s crazy I remember every detail, but I do
I can still smell your perfume
Girl, that night was just like you
Unforgettable

[Outro]
From your blue jeans to your shoes
Girl, that night was just like you
Unforgettable

[Verse 1]
"Take a left here, boy, take it slow
Don't get distracted by that radio"
I just rolled my eyes and I said, "Daddy, I know
I'm fifteen, I ain't green like some ol' ten year old"

[Chorus]
What I wouldn't give to be sixteen, wild and free
Cruisin' up and down Main in my F-150
Roll the windows down, bass too loud from this burnt CD
I'll be right where I wanna be when I'm sixteen, sixteen, yeah
Sixteen

[Verse 2]
Now that I can drive, finally feel alive, but I got this curfew
Sneakin' in late, smelling like my girlfriend's perfume
People talkin' 'bout college and knowledge and that's alright
But all I'm thinkin' 'bout is an unsupervised Saturday night

[Chorus]
What I wouldn't give to be eighteen, wild and free
Buzzin' off a can of that Grizzly wintergreen
Lookin' old enough to pull off this fake ID
I'll be right where I wanna be when I'm eighteen, eighteen
Eighteen, yeah

[Bridge]
I'm old enough to smoke, I'm old enough to vote
But they turn me away when I go to the Cotton-Eyed Joe
They say the grass is always greener, and I believe that's right
But my friends are off to Vegas, and they're leavin' me behind

[Chorus]
What I wouldn't give to be twenty one, wild and free
Open up a cold one and drink it legally
Chase a bunch of girls, go see the world, let my wild streak run
I'll be right where I wanna be when I'm twenty one, twenty one
Woah, when I'm twenty one
Yeah, when I'm twenty one, it'll be alright
Yeah, it'll all be alright when I'm twenty one

[Outro]
Now I'm twenty five, and I'm drinkin' wine with my wife at home
Got a couple dogs and a couple songs on the radio
And we sit around, and we laugh about how we used to be
When all we cared about was turning sixteen

[Verse 1]
Get off work and we meet down at our spot
We had a patio with a view of a parking lot
It was two for one and four for two
Had Christmas lights in the middle of June
All hung up like I was on you

[Pre-Chorus]
I said hey, hey baby, do you wanna come over
You say, "No way" then you move in closer
Next thing I know you were wearing my

[Chorus]
T-shirt, right there
Your hair messed up like a Guns-N-Roses video
Oh oh, so hot
Still got it up in my head
You were moving around in the TV light
I ain't ever seen anything like
Your dress, my floor
The way you wore my, my T-shirt
Yeah, you look good in my t-shirt, girl
Oh yeah

[Verse 2]
We were walking up the stairs
With the neighbors saying "Keep it down"
But it's hard to unlock the door
When you're making out (You know what I'm sayin'?)
You've been saying that we've gotta quit doin' this
So why you leanin' in for one more kiss
And pretty soon you're sliding off what you've got on
And slippin' into my

[Chorus]
T-shirt, right there
Your hair messed up like a Guns-N-Roses video
Oh oh, so hot
Still got it up in my head
You were moving around in the TV light
I ain't ever seen anything like
Your dress, my floor
The way you wore my, my t-shirt
In my t-shirt

[Post-Chorus]
Oh no, baby no, I can't lie
Cause you sure look good in my t-shirt
Oh no, baby no, I can't lie
You look good on my mind

[Bridge]
I said, "Hey, hey baby, do you wanna come over?"
You say, "No way" then you move in closer
Next thing I know, you were wearing my t-shirt
Mmm, you look just so dang hot in my t-shirt
I see you spinning around in my t-shirt
Right there
Your hair messed up like a Guns-N-Roses video
Oh oh, so hot

[Chorus]
My t-shirt right there
Your hair messed up like a Guns-N-Roses video
Oh oh, so hot
Still got it up in my head
You were moving around in the TV light
I ain't ever seen anything like
Your dress, my floor
The way you wore my, my t-shirt
You look good in my t-shirt, baby
Yeah
(You think you're gonna look good in my t-shirt)
You look good in my t-shirt
Yeah, I think you look good in my t-shirt, uh
(You think you're gonna look good in my t-shirt)
Oh, you look so good in my t-shirt
(You think you're gonna look good in my t-shirt)

[Verse 1]
My girl is rocking that Billabong bikini like she’s sponsored
Asking me if I can rub that Coppertone on her
Got a couple bucks, but I’m spending them like they pesos
Might be Motel Sixing but it feels like Turks and Caicos

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Put a little liquor in my coconut water (Coconut water)
Party all day like you at your alma mater (At your alma mater)
Put a little liquor in my coconut water (Coconut water)
Ice has started melting 'cause it’s always getting hotter

[Chorus]
Singing hey, let’s party like we on vacation
Hey, let’s party like we on vacation
I got my toes up in the sand
Cold one in my hand
Toes up in the sand
Cold one in my hand
Singing hey, let’s party like we on vacation

[Verse 2]
I got my Solo Cup amplifier, playing all my jams
And my Walgreens beach chair working on my tan
Feels like it’s Jamaica and I’m sippin' on some Red Stripe
But I’m in Decatur, baby, crushing on that Busch light

[Chorus]
Hey, let’s party like we on vacation
Hey, yeah, let’s party like we on vacation (I got, I got, I got)
Toes up in the sand
Cold one in my hand
Toes up in the sand
Cold one in my hand
Singing hey, let’s party like we on vacation

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Put a little liquor in my coconut water
Party all day like you at your alma mater
Put a little liquor in my coconut water
My ice has started melting, so I’ll take another swallow

[Chorus]
Singing hey, let’s party like we on vacation
Hey, let’s party like we on vacation
You know I got my toes up in the sand
Cold one in my hand
Toes up in the sand
Cold one in my hand
Singing hey, let’s party like we on vacation

[Bridge]
(Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh)
Party like I’m on vacation
(Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh)
Party like I’m on vacation
(Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh)
Party like I’m on vacation
(Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh)
I’m gonna rehydrate, while I dehydrate, you know

[Chorus]
Hey, let’s party like we on vacation
Hey, yeah, let’s party like we on vacation
I got my toes up in the sand
Cold one in my hand
Toes up in the sand
Cold one in my hand
Singing hey, let’s party like we on vacation

[Outro]
(Sing it to me)
Hey, let’s party like we on vacation
Hey, party like we on vacation

[Verse 1: Thomas Rhett]
I know I should let it go
Take a different road
When I'm driving home
But I don't want to
Delete your number from my phone
Instead of calling
Asking if you're all alone
But I don't want to

[Pre-Chorus: Thomas Rhett]
Stay away
From your side of town
But it's too late
I'm in your drive right now

[Chorus: Thomas Rhett]
I don't know, why I don't
Put it out, baby
We kiss and the flames just get higher
But yeah, I know
When I hold onto you, baby
I'm all tangled up in barbed wire
I get burned, I don't learn
I'll be back, give it time
Yeah, I know it sounds crazy
But guess I like playing with fire

[Verse 2: Jordin Sparks]
Ooh
I could find a spot to go hang out on Friday night
Where you are gonna be
But I don't want to, no
Yeah, I could let it end
Call it quits, call off all this on and off again
But I just don't want to

[Pre-Chorus: Jordin Sparks]
Yeah, that key
Is right under the mat
Come on in
Baby, let's strike that match

[Chorus: Thomas Rhett & Jordin Sparks]
I don't know, why I don't
Put it out, baby
We kiss and the flames just get higher
But yeah, I know
When I hold onto you, baby
I'm all tangled up in barbed wire
I get burned, I don't learn
I'll be back, give it time
Yeah, I know it sounds crazy
But guess I like playing with fire
Playing with fire

[Bridge: Thomas Rhett & (Jordin Sparks)]
So let's fire it up one more time (Fire it up one more time)
Baby, just put your lips on mine (Lips on mine)

[Chorus: Thomas Rhett & (Jordin Sparks)]
I don't know, why I don't
Put it out, baby
We kiss and the flames just get higher
(We kiss and the flames just get higher)
But yeah, I know
When I hold onto you, baby (Onto you, baby)
I'm all tangled up in barbed wire (All tangled up)
(I'm all tangled up)
I get burned, I don't learn
I'll be back, give it time (Give it time)
Yeah, I know it sounds crazy (Sounds crazy)
But guess I like playing with fire (Playing with fire)
Playing with fire
(Playing with fire)

[Outro: Jordin Sparks]
Playing with fire, huh

[Verse 1]
Hey, buddies that I grew up with
All straight-laced and married up now
You ain't foolin' me, wasn't long ago
We tore the roof off that one red light town
And hey, darlin', sippin' that red wine
All classy, kicked back on the couch
You smile and I see ya shootin' tequila
Us shuttin' them college bars down

[Chorus]
And no matter how much time goes by
And no matter how much we grow up
For worse or for better, from now 'til forever
I'll always remember you young

[Verse 2]
And hey, babies, crawlin’ on the carpet
No, you won’t be that little for long
One day, you’ll move away, but you’re still gonna stay
This innocent after you’re gone

[Chorus]
'Cause no matter how much time goes by
And no matter how much you grow up
For worse or for better, from now 'til forever
I'll always remember you young

[Post-Chorus]
Whoa-oh-oh, whoa-oh-oh
Whoa-oh-oh, oh, oh

[Bridge]
Yeah, I hope when we get to Heaven
He looks at us all like we're kids
Shameless and painless and perfect and ageless
Forgives all the wrong that we did

[Chorus]
And no matter how much time goes by
I hope we never have to grow up
We'll say for worse or for better, from now 'til forever
I'll always remember you young

[Post-Chorus]
Whoa-oh-oh, oh
I'll always remember you young

[Verse: 1]
So I guess it's over, baby
Déjà vu again
Who'd have thought that time don't stop?
And somehow girl, the world keeps spinning
And guess I've turned myself into a solitary man
Ain't like I'm the only one that's in the shoes that I am

[Chorus]
Do you hear that? (Do you hear that?)
I'm right back (I'm right back)
At the sound of lonely calling
Do you hear that? (Do you hear that?)
It's where I'm at (It's where I'm at)
It's the sound of teardrops falling down, down
A slamming door and a lesson learned
I let another lover crash and burn

[Verse 2]
I know that it might sound jaded
And I have to say
I think love is overrated
But I don't like throwing it away
I know you could probably tell me right where I went wrong
Some guys can't have all the luck if others don't sing sad songs

[Chorus]
Do you hear that? (Do you hear that?)
I'm right back (I'm right back)
At the sound of lonely calling
Do you hear that? (Do you hear that?)
It's where I'm at (It's where I'm at)
It's the sound of teardrops falling down, down
A slamming door and a lesson learned
I let another lover crash and burn

[Bridge]
That's right
Another lover
Another lover, crash and burn
Ooh, yeah

[Chorus]
Do you hear that? (Do you hear that?)
I'm right back (I'm right back)
At the sound of lonely calling
Do you hear that? (Do you hear that?)
It's where I'm at (It's where I'm at)
It's the sound of teardrops falling down, down
A slamming door and a lesson learned
I let another lover crash and burn
Yeah, I let another lover crash and burn

[Verse 1]
Don't even want the attention
But yeah, that's all that she's getting
Her song is on and she's spinning around, yeah
She got me drunk like Corona
Heart racing like it's Daytona
Ooh, I'm in Heaven, I swear, right now

[Pre-Chorus]
And those eyes can hypnotize
Was designed to blow my mind

[Chorus]
Look what God gave her, how perfect He made her
She walks in the room, it's like He answered my prayers
The way that she moves, how could anybody blame her?
I know she's got haters, but it ain't her fault, nah
Look what God gave her

[Verse 2]
It's like I heard angels singing
Like she came down from the ceiling
When she walked in here this evening, I thought, yeah
That girl one in seven billion
Got everyone in here feeling
Like there's a fire in this building, so hot

[Pre-Chorus]
Got a smile on her angel face
I know I'll never lose my faith

[Chorus]
Look what God gave her, how perfect He made her
She walks in the room, it's like He answered my prayers
The way that she moves, how could anybody blame her?
I know she's got haters, but it ain't her fault, nah
Look what God gave her

[Bridge]
Got that look in her eyes
Swear she fell right out the sky
Yeah, I think I've seen the light
Every kiss, I could die
It's like the heavens opened wide
Man, I swear I've seen the light

[Chorus]
Look what God gave her, how perfect He made her
She walks in the room, it's like He answered my prayers
The way that she moves, how could anybody blame her?
I know she's got haters, but it ain't her fault, nah
Look what God gave her

[Post-Chorus]
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, look what God gave her (Look what God gave her)
Ooh, ooh
Oh yeah, look what God gave her

[Verse 1]
Same streets, same party
Drowning their problems in Bacardi
Same people still talking
Whoa, I'm so over it, I'm sorry

[Chorus]
Baby, you and me can leave right now
Ditch all your friends, and the guy you came with
Get to know you where it ain't so loud
Just you and me alone, some old moonlit road
Well, the two of us could disappear
Just say the word, we'll get outta here
Baby, you and me can leave right now
Meet me out back if you like how that sounds

[Post-Chorus]
You and me could
You and me could
We can leave right now
You and me could
If you like how that sounds
You and me could

[Verse 2]
If not, I get it
That smile on your face, yeah, it says different
One kiss, girl, just try it
'Cause you never know, you just might like it

[Chorus]
Baby, you and me can leave right now
Ditch all your friends, and the guy you came with
Get to know you where it ain't so loud
Just you and me alone, some old moonlit road
Well, the two of us could disappear
Just say the word, we'll get outta here
Baby, you and me can leave right now
Meet me out back if you like how that sounds

[Post-Chorus]
You and me could
You and me could
We can leave right now
You and me could
If you like how that sounds
You and me could
Oh, baby, you and me could
Oh, baby, you and me could

[Bridge]
Same streets, same party
Same people still talking

[Chorus]
Baby, you and me can leave right now
Ditch all your friends, and the guy you came with
Get to know you where it ain't so loud
Just you and me alone, some old moonlit road
Well, the two of us could disappear
Just say the word, we'll get outta here
Baby, you and me can leave right now
Meet me out back if you like how that sounds

[Verse 1]
Windows down, country sound, FM on the radio
Just me and you and the man on the moon
Cruisin' down some old back road

[Pre-Chorus]
Now baby, don't you look at me that way
'Cause you know there's only so much I can take
'Cause you make me wanna

[Chorus]
Pull this truck to the side of the road
Slide on over, let me hold you close
And tell you everything I'm thinkin'
Hop on out and let the tailgate fall
Get drunk on you with no alcohol
If you don't stop, I'm gonna
Girl, you make me wanna

[Verse 2]
You know better than to wear that dress
It oughta be against the law
Plain and simple, girl, them dimples
Know just how to turn me on

[Pre-Chorus]
Now baby, don't you look at me that way
'Cause you know there's only so much I can take
'Cause you make me wanna

[Chorus]
Pull this truck to the side of the road
Slide on over, let me hold you close
And tell you everything I'm thinkin'
Hop on out and let the tailgate fall
Get drunk on you with no alcohol
If you don't stop, I'm gonna
Girl, you make me wanna

[Bridge]
You make me wanna
Wake up with you, in the bed of my truck
And start over again when the sun comes up

[Chorus]
You make me wanna
Pull this truck to the side of the road
Slide on over, let me hold you close
And tell you everything I'm thinkin'
Hop on out and let the tailgate fall
Get drunk on you with no alcohol
If you don't stop, I'm gonna
You make me wanna
Pull this truck to the side of the road
Slide on over, let me hold you close
And tell you everything I'm thinkin'
Hop on out and let the tailgate fall
Get drunk on you with no alcohol
If you don't stop, I'm gonna
Girl, you make me wanna
Yeah, yeah

[Outro]
Windows down, country sound, FM on the radio

[Intro]
Sweetheart, God could've never made two
Nobody quite like you

[Verse 1]
Woke up this morning to your sleepy smile
I realized I haven't told you in a while
That you're my life, you're my dream
You're the reason for every song I sing
You're my rock, you're my world
You're my always and forever, girl

[Chorus]
Sweetheart, God could've never made two
Nobody quite like you
Woah, sweetheart, one kiss and I come unglued
You are the reason I fall to pieces
'Cause you're all that I adore
You're the one my heart beats for
And I can't believe you gave your sweet heart to me

[Verse 2]
Yeah, you're sweet like chocolate, hot like Sriracha
Yeah, girl you got me right in your back pocket
You're smooth like whiskey, fine like wine
I love how you're making my blood sugar rise

[Chorus]
My sweetheart, God could've never made two
Nobody quite like you
Woah, sweetheart, one kiss and I come unglued
You are the reason I fall to pieces
'Cause you're all that I adore
You're the one my heart beats for
And I can't believe you gave your sweet heart to me

[Bridge]
When the world gets cold on those sleepless nights
Oh, girl, you should know that you will always be mine

[Chorus]
My sweetheart, God could've never made two
Nobody quite like you
Woah, sweetheart, one kiss and I come unglued
You are the reason I fall to pieces
'Cause you're all that I adore
You're the one my heart beats for
And I can't believe you gave your sweet heart to me

[Outro]
Oh, yeah, you gave your sweet heart to me
Oh, yeah, you gave your sweet heart to me
Oh, please give your sweet heart to me

[Verse 1]
You say it every day now
I know I get spaced out in a conversation
Yeah, it's been a hard year
You say that I don't hear all the words you're saying
And it makes you miss me even when you're with me
Feels like something's broken
I know I've been acting easily distracted
You wish I could focus

[Chorus]
You think that I don't notice
How you brush your hair out of your green eyes
The way you blush when you drink red wine
The way you smile when you try to bend the truth
You think that I don't notice
All the songs you sing underneath your breath
You still tear up at a beach sunset
And you dance just like you're the only one in the room
You think that I don't notice, but I do
(I do, yeah, I do, yeah)

[Verse 2]
At that party last night
Baby, I don't know why I forgot to mention
You were looking drop-dead, not even a contest
Center of attention
If I had to say every time you looked amazing
You'd think I was joking
But I brag about you when I'm not around you
You don't even know it

[Chorus]
You think that I don't notice
How you brush your hair out of your green eyes
The way you blush when you drink red wine
The way you smile when you try to bend the truth
You think that I don't notice
All the songs you sing underneath your breath
You still tear up at a beach sunset
And you dance just like you're the only one in the room
You think that I don't notice, but I

[Bridge]
See it all, and I keep on falling for you every night
Over and over again
It's my fault that I don't remind you every day of your life
You're perfect
(I do, yeah, I do, yeah)

[Chorus]
You think that I don't notice
How you brush your hair out of your green eyes
The way you blush when you drink red wine
The way you smile when you try to bend the truth
You think that I don't notice
All the songs you sing underneath your breath
You still tear up at a beach sunset
And you dance just like you're the only one in the room
You think that I don't notice, but I do
(I do, yeah, I do, yeah)

[Verse 1]
Lights are down, but you're shining like you always do
Every day, I'm reminded of the miracle of you

[Pre-Chorus]
You're too good for coincidence
And too perfect for an accident
And I'm not sure where Heaven is
But every night, I get a glimpse

[Chorus]
And I know I'm blessed
Watching you spin in that dress
Making my heart beat out my chest
I can't count the times I've heard
People say I'm lucky, but lucky ain't the word
Oh, I'm blessed
And all I ain't got is my breath
You stole it the first time we meet
You're more than I deserve
People say I'm lucky, but lucky ain't the word
Oh, I'm

[Verse 2]
I keep checking you for halos
Swear you're an angel in disguise
You poke my mind from every angle, and I
I can see Heaven in your eyes

[Pre-Chorus]
You're too good for coincidence
And too perfect for an accident
And I'm not sure where Heaven is
But every night, I get a glimpse

[Chorus]
And I know I'm blessed (Blessed)
Watching you spin in that dress (Dress)
Making my heart beat out my chest
I can't count the times I've heard
People say I'm lucky, but lucky ain't the word
Oh, I'm blessed (Blessed)
And all I ain't got is my breath (Breath)
You stole it the first time we met
You're more than I deserve
People say I'm lucky, but lucky ain't the word
Oh, I'm

[Bridge]
Baby, you're the kind of girl that I've always prayed for
And I swear by my dying breath that I will be faithful
Oh, baby
'Cause I'm on my knees (I'm on my knees)
Whoa, you make me believe

[Chorus]
Baby, I'm blessed (Blessed)
Watching you spin in that dress (Dress)
Making my heart beat out my chest
I can't count the times I've heard
People say I'm lucky, but lucky ain't the word
Oh, I'm blessed (Blessed)
And all I ain't got is my breath (Breath)
You stole it the first time we met
You're more than I deserve
People say I'm lucky, but lucky ain't the word
Oh, I'm blessed

[Verse 1]
You're my forever, my slice of heaven
On this side of the Mississippi River, baby
You're my infinity, no end to you and me
Come hell, fire, or rain, baby, nothin' can change it
No, nothin' can change it

[Chorus]
Ooh, when the good Lord calls me home and this life is through
I may be six feet deep, but I'll still be lovin' you
Baby, what we got won't ever die
Can't take diamonds, can't take gold
But I'll take your love with me when I go
I'm gonna take it to the grave with me

[Verse 2]
You're my destiny, you'll always be with me
Today, tomorrow, all the way to eternity, baby
No last breath taken on this earth
No concrete tombstone, no amount of dirt can change it
No, nothin' can change it

[Chorus]
Ooh, when the good Lord calls me home and this life is through
I may be six feet deep, but I'll still be lovin' you
Baby, what we got won't ever die
Can't take diamonds, can't take gold
But I'll take your love with me when I go
I'm gonna take it to the grave with me
To the grave with me, to the grave with me
To the grave, to the grave with me
To the grave with me, to the grave with me
To the grave, to the grave, to the grave with me
To the grave with me, to the grave with me
To the grave, to the grave, to the grave with me
To the grave with me, to the grave with me
To the grave, to the grave, to the grave with me

[Bridge]
You're my forever, my slice of heaven
On this side of the Mississippi River, baby

[Chorus]
Ooh, when the good Lord calls me home and this life is through
I may be six feet deep, but I'll still be lovin' you
Baby, what we got won't ever die
Can't take diamonds, can't take gold
But I'll take your love with me when I go
I'm gonna take it to the grave with me

[Verse 1]
You said you only had time for one drink
But that dress that you're wearing says a whole 'nother thing
You laugh and you smile and you wink
Got my head spinning 'round like a roller rink
It's going places we've never been
And it's getting better with every tonic and gin
Got a Hollywood glow on your skin
Wearin' that "I will if you will" grin

[Chorus 1]
How are we not supposed to crawl to the next bar
Make out on the dance floor
Take it too far out the back door
Leave an open tab, when you look like that?
And tell me how am I supposed to keep my hands to myself
When you're making my mind wander somewhere else?
It's on a one-way track when you look like that

[Verse 2]
How am I supposed to play it cool
With that sexy, adorable way you move?
I love watching you break your own rules
Come on, let me help you break a few

[Chorus 1]
How are we not supposed to crawl to the next bar
Make out on the dance floor
Take it too far out the back door
Leave an open tab, when you look like that?
And tell me how am I supposed to keep my hands to myself
When you're making my mind wander somewhere else?
It's on a one-way track when you look like that

[Bridge]
Like a couple million bucks, a bombshell deluxe
Girl, you got it all together, why you messing me up?
I'm seeing you and me as the honkey tonk dream
Saying, "Girl, we're on a roll"

[Chorus 2]
And how are we not supposed to take another lap around the block
And make a pit stop, your place, my place, any place?
Wanna make it last when you look like
When you look like that, yeah

[Outro]
When you look like that, baby
When you look, when you look like that, whoa
You just do something to my soul, I just can't describe it
When you look like that, hoo
Hey, yeah, yeah, yeah
You drive me crazy when you, when you look like
Just like that right there

[Verse 1: Thomas Rhett]
You're all alone at a party, you wanna dance with somebody
But you ain't got a clue how to ask
You and your girl had a fight and now she's sayin' goodbye
She ran upstairs and packed her bags

[Pre-Chorus: Thomas Rhett]
It could be rainin' on your perfect vacation
You could be stressed about your work situation
Ain't gotta listen to me, but all I'm sayin'

[Chorus: Thomas Rhett]
Ain't nothing that a beer can't fix
Ain't no pain it can't wash away
From the moment that it hits your lips
Makes those clouds look a little less gray
Oh, you could be lonely, or heartbroken
Or hungover from the night before
Turn that frown into a smile real quick
There ain't nothing that a beer can't fix

[Verse 2: Jon Pardi]
You're on a lake and you're fishin'
It's hot and all that you're gettin' is a little nibble here and there
You're sitttin', watchin' your team losin' that championship ring
And you're feelin like life ain't fair

[Pre-Chorus: Jon Pardi]
It could be rainin' on your perfect vacation
You could be stressed about your work situation

[Chorus: Jon Pardi]
Ain't nothing that a beer can't fix
Ain't no pain, it can't wash away
From the moment that it hits your lips
Makes those clouds look a little less gray
Oh, you could be lonely, heartbroken
Or hungover from the night before
Turn that frown into a smile real quick
Ain't nothing that a beer can't fix (Yeehaw)

[Bridge: Thomas Rhett & Jon Pardi]
It could be rainin' on your perfect vacation
You could be stressed about your work situation
Ain't gotta save it for no special occasion

[Chorus: Thomas Rhett, Jon Pardi & Both]
Ain't nothing that a beer can't fix
Ain't no pain, it can't wash away, no
From the moment that it hits your lips
Makes those clouds look a little less gray
Oh, you could be lonely (Lonely)
Heartbroken (Heartbroken)
Or hungover from the night before
Turn that frown into a smile real quick (So quick)
It might take one or it might take six
Drink it down, it will do the trick
Ain't nothing that a beer can't fix

[Verse 1]
Will you still roll your eyes when I tell dirty jokes?
Will I still hold your hand when we're drivin' down the road?
Will you still hide a bottle of wine in your purse when we're at the movie?
Will you still slap my hand away when I try and smack your booty?

[Chorus]
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
Tell me it'll always be this way
You'll be even more beautiful when you're gray and crazy
We'll still kiss and we might cuss
Just tell me that we'll still be us when we're 80
When we're 80

[Verse 2]
Will you still rub my feet when I put down the seat?
Will you still call me honey if we run out of money tomorrow?
Will we still walk the dogs, will I still take you fishin'
And dance in the kitchen and listen and sway to Sinatra?
Fly Me To The Moon, baby
When we watch The Notebook, will we still get sentimental?
Will I drop you off at the beauty shop in a Lincoln Continental, singin'

[Chorus]
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
Tell me it'll always be this way
You'll be even more beautiful when you're gray and crazy
We'll still kiss and we might cuss
Just tell me that we'll still be us when we're 80
When we're 80

[Bridge]
When we're 80
Won't you grow young with me, girl?

[Chorus]
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
Tell me it'll always be this way
You'll be even more beautiful when you're gray and crazy
We'll still kiss and we might cuss
Just tell me that we'll still be us when we're 80
When we're 80

[Verse 1]
Stop starin' at the rearview
You ain't checkin' your hair
That wheel has spun and them lights are out
There ain't nothin' for you back there
Stop holdin' on so dang tight, 'bout time you let go
But he's a heart breakin', let you down, son-of-a-gun
But I ain't sayin' nothin' you don't know

[Chorus]
The day you stop lookin' back
You're gonna find that the future
Sure beats the hell outta the past
Now he ain't no good
I guess he's good as gone
The day you stop lookin' back, girl, yeah
Is the day you start movin' on

[Verse 2]
That sun's gonna come up
It's gonna feel good
And after all the rain and pain you've seen
I hope you soak it up like you should
Now and then it's gonna stir up
When you hear that old song
But don't let it get to ya, baby
It's only three and a half minutes long

[Chorus]
Well, the day you stop lookin' back
You're gonna find that the future
Sure beats the hell outta the past
Now he ain't no good
I guess he's good as gone
The day you stop lookin' back, girl, yeah
Is the day you start movin' on, yeah

[Bridge]
Well now, hey girl, why you lookin' back like that?
Don't you wanna trade tears for laughs and love
That could be us tonight

[Chorus]
Well, the day you stop lookin' back
You're gonna find that the future
Sure beats the hell outta the past
Now he ain't no good
I guess he's good as gone
The day you stop lookin' back, girl, yeah
Is the day you start movin' on, yeah

[Outro]
Is the day you start movin' on
Stop staring at the rear view
You ain't checkin' your hair
That wheel is spun and them lights are out
There ain't nothin' for you back there

[Verse 1: Thomas Rhett]
We drank our beer in the basement
So no one would know
We didn't care where the days went
Had nowhere to go, Center Point Road
When everything was about a kiss
And clouds just looked like battleships
Helmets crashin' on the field
And we thought every love was real

[Chorus: Thomas Rhett]
We wrote our own destiny
In parkin' lots and empty streets
Yeah, we got high on you and me
Jumped over cracks beneath our feet
And we thought it would never end
Then watched it go like summer wind
When growin' up was just a dream
And Friday night was everything

[Verse 2: Kelsea Ballerini]
Yeah, we didn't worry 'bout nothin'
We had it all, yeah
And bein' the fastest was somethin'
Runnin' the halls, breakin' the law
Life was about the party (The party, yeah)
Who you are and who you're with
Drinkin' 'til your head was sorry
Oh, and dancin' for the hell of it, yeah

[Chorus: Kelsea Ballerini]
We wrote our own destiny
In parkin' lots and empty streets
Yeah, we got high on you and me
Jumped over cracks beneath our feet
And we thought it would never end
Then watched it go like summer wind
When growin' up was just a dream
And Friday night was everything

[Bridge: Thomas Rhett, Kelsea Ballerini & Both]
Hold on forever (Hold on forever)
Yeah, hold onto it (Hold onto it)
Yeah, hold on forever (Hold on forever)
And never let go of it (Ooh, ooh)
Everyone says when you're younger
It's gonna go fast
It suddenly hits you like thunder
And you're gonna wanna go back
Wanna go back, wanna go back, wanna go back

[Chorus: Thomas Rhett & Kelsea Ballerini, Kelsea Ballerini]
We wrote our own destiny (Oh yeah)
In parkin' lots and empty streets
Yeah, we got high on you and me
Jumped over cracks beneath our feet (Oh, whoa)
And we thought it would never end (Ooh yeah)
Then watched it go like summer wind (Ooh, ooh)
When growin' up was just a dream (Just a dream, yeah)
And Friday night was everything

[Outro: Thomas Rhett & Kelsea Ballerini, Thomas Rhett]
We wrote our own destiny
In parkin' lots and empty streets
When growin' up was just a dream
And Friday night was everything

[Verse 1]
Walking down the street, hand in mine
It don't keep them other guys
And their wandering eyes from looking at you
That's alright and that's okay
Who can blame 'em anyway?
You're so pretty, and you ain't even got a clue

[Chorus]
'Cause everywhere we go, girl
You're the star of the show
And everybody's wondering and wanting to know
What's your name?
Who's that girl, with the prettiest smile in the world?
Oh, what gets me the most is you don't even know
That you are, you are, you are
The star of the show
You're the star of the show, yeah, baby

[Verse 2]
Friday night on the town
We walk in and you draw a crowd
Even the band seems to sing for you
Ease on up, order a drink, barkeep says it's all on me
You look at me and laugh like you don't know what to do
Baby, you're so cute

[Chorus]
'Cause everywhere we go, girl
You're the star of the show
And everybody's wondering and wanting to know
Whats your name?
Who's that girl, with the prettiest smile in the world?
Oh, what gets me the most is you don't even know
That you are, you are, you are
The star of the show, yeah
You're the star of the show, baby, yeah yeah

[Bridge]
Even in a ponytail, in a pair of jeans
You look like a cover of a magazine
Baby, you're the only one who doesn't see

[Chorus]
That everywhere we go, girl
You're the star of the show
And everyone's wondering and wanting to know
Whats your name?
Who's that girl with the luckiest guy in the world?
Oh, what gets me the most is you don't even know
That you are, you are, you are
You are, you are, you are
Baby, you are, you are, you are the star of the show..

[Outro]
Don't you know, you're the star of the show, baby

[Verse 1]
How to be proud of that town ain't nobody heard of
Had a big dream, seventeen, some day how to grow up
How to make dust fly out on a no name road
Yeah, I learned it from the radio

[Verse 2]
How to wake up, how to work tough
How to roll up those sleeves, how to throw down
How to get loud, and what to put in that drink
To give the stars in the sky a little halo
Yeah, I learned it from the radio

[Chorus]
If it wasn't for the speakers in the door
Telling me a truth I hadn't ever heard before
I never woulda kissed that girl
Never woulda known what to say
I would have never known better, I'd have let her get away
Thank God for four wheel drive
Thank God for windows down
And all the DJ's in all those little static towns
How to live, how to love
Everything I need to know
I learned it from the radio

[Verse 3]
What to say when you think that you've found that girl
Who to call when she's gone and she wrecks your world
How to get over it, yeah, how to let her go
I learned it from the radio

[Verse 4]
How to see it all, from a front porch
And how to say it all just using three chords
And when to run when you're young, when to come back home
I learned it from the radio

[Chorus]
If it wasn't for the speakers in the door
Telling me a truth I hadn't ever heard before
I never woulda kissed that girl
Never woulda known what to say
I would have never known better, I'd have let her get away
Thank God for four wheel drive
Thank God for windows down
And all the DJ's in all those little static towns
How to live, how to love
Everything I need to know
I learned it from the radio

[Bridge]
From the radio
I learned it from the radio
Back when we used to burn it up, turn it up, up, up, up

[Chorus]
If it wasn't for the speakers in the door
Telling me a truth I haven't ever heard before
I never woulda kissed that girl
Never woulda known what to say
I would have never known better, I'd have let her get away
Thank God for four wheel drive
Thank God for windows down
And all the DJ's in all those little static towns
How to live, how to love
Everything I need to know
I learned it from the radio

[Outro]
From the radio
I learned it from the radio
Back when we use to burn it up, turn it up

[Intro: Thomas Rhett & Rhett Akins]
Drink a little beer, play a little music
And have a big time tonight

[Verse 1: Thomas Rhett]
Got a Tennessee girl, a Rocky Top breeze
And a big ol' yellow moon
A new set of strings on my '69
And a Yeti full of iced-down booze
Everybody 'round this sleepy little town
Heading down Pinetucky Road
Gonna leave our worries in a cloud of dust
Right there by the old fence post

[Chorus: Thomas Rhett & Rhett Akins]
Yeah, we're gonna drink a little beer, play a little music
And have a big time tonight
A bunch of down home boys and some blue jean girls
Kicking up the dirt and shooting out the lights
Life can be an ol' briar patch
Gotta dance your way through it sometimes
So we're gonna drink a little beer, play a little music
And have a big time tonight

[Verse 2: Rhett Akins]
Got a pig in the ground, stars in the sky
And a jar full of lightning juice
Got a worn-out path to the river bank
Everybody coming out of them boots
Gonna pick a few songs all night long
Ones that we grew up on
Some fishing in the dark, some Copperhead Road
Everybody just sing along

[Chorus: Thomas Rhett & Rhett Akins]
Yeah, we're gonna drink a little beer, play a little music
And have a big time tonight
A bunch of down home boys and some blue jean girls
Kicking up the dirt and shooting out the lights
Life can be an ol' briar patch
Gotta dance your way through it sometimes
So we're gonna drink a little beer, play a little music
And have a big time tonight

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus: Thomas Rhett & Rhett Akins]
Yeah, we're gonna drink a little beer, play a little music
And have a big time tonight
A bunch of down home boys and some blue jean girls
Kicking up the dirt and shooting out the lights
Life can be an ol' briar patch
Gotta dance your way through it sometimes
So we're gonna drink a little beer, play a little music
And have a big time tonight
Yeah, we're gonna drink a little beer, play a little music
And have a big time tonight
A bunch of down home boys and some blue jean girls
Kicking up the dirt and shooting out the lights
Life can be an ol' briar patch
Gotta dance your way through it sometimes
So we're gonna drink a little beer, play a little music
And have a big time tonight

[Post-Chorus: Thomas Rhett & Rhett Akins]
Drink a little beer, play a little music
And have a big time tonight
That's right

[Outro: Thomas Rhett & Rhett Akins]
Ah, come on boys, whoo!
This is so weird having my dad on a song right now
Considering he's 50
Uh, 47
I think he's gonna make a comeback album and this is the start of it
I taught you everything you know, son
But not everything I know
We through playing now

[Verse 1]
Our Fridays are Mondays and our second home is on wheels
I told you I'd slow down, but we both know I never will
Half of our nights, baby, we spend 'em sleeping alone
"I gotta go" conversations and raising our kids through the phone

[Chorus]
I know it's been hard, I know it ain't easy
Oh, but I couldn't do one show without you, oh baby, believe me
Crowds have been crazy, but baby, I'm missin' you bad
Just wanna say thank you for living this dream I know you never had

[Verse 2]
I'm seeing those signs with your name written on 'em in lights
Spotlight's on me, but they know you're the reason I shine
You married the music the day that you married me
Baby, I'm just a singer, and you are the songs that I sing

[Chorus]
I know it's been hard, I know it ain't easy
Oh, but I couldn't do one show without you, oh baby, believe me
Crowds have been crazy, but baby, I'm missing you bad
Just wanna say thank you for living this dream I know you never had

[Bridge]
Ones that
Even when I did, you stuck it out
Baby, I see you in every town
Even when you're so far away

[Chorus]
I know it's been hard, I know it ain't easy
Oh, but I couldn't do one show without you, oh baby, believe me
Crowds have been crazy, but baby, I'm missing you bad
Just wanna say thank you for living this dream I know you never had
Just wanna say thank you for living this dream I know you never had

[Intro]
Mmm, yeah

[Verse 1]
Yeah girl, been diggin' on you
Sippin' on drink number two
Tryin' to come up with somethin' smooth
And waitin' on the right time to make my move
But I just can't wait no more
Can't let you slip out that door
Prettiest thing I ever seen before
Got me spinnin' around, I ain't even on the dance floor

[Chorus]
You're shakin' that money maker, like a heart breaker, like your college major was
Twistin' and tearin' up Friday nights
Love the way you're wearin' those jeans so tight (So tight)
I bet your kiss is a soul saver, my favorite flavor, want it now and later
I never seen nothin' that I wanted so bad
Girl, I gotta get me, gotta get me some of that
Yeah, gotta get me some of that

[Verse 2]
Little more, what you doin' right there?
Swingin' your hips and slingin' your hair
Side to side with your drink in the air
Lord have mercy, now girl, I swear (I swear)
Gotta get your number in my phone
Gotta get me some of you alone (All alone)
We can worry 'bout it later on
Right now keep makin' this my favorite song

[Chorus]
You're shakin' that money maker, like a heart breaker, like your college major was
Twistin' and tearin' up Friday nights
Love the way you're wearin' those jeans so tight (So tight)
I bet your kiss is a soul saver, my favorite flavor, want it now and later
I never seen nothin' that I wanted so bad
Girl, I gotta get me, gotta get me some of that
Some of that
Yeah, I gotta get me some of that

[Bridge]
In my ride, by my side, down the highway
In the dark, in my arms, in your driveway
All because of that smile you threw my way
Yeah, girl, you got a way of

[Chorus]
You're shakin' that money maker, like a heart breaker, like your college major was
Twistin' and tearin' up Friday nights
Love the way you're wearin' those jeans so tight (So tight)
I bet your kiss is a soul saver, my favorite flavor, want it now and later
I never seen nothin' that I wanted so bad
Girl, I gotta get me, gotta get me some of that
I gotta get me some of that

[Outro]
Yeah, I gotta get me some of that
Oh girl, I gotta get me some of that
Oh yeah
Mmm, mmm
I bet your kiss is a soul saver, my favorite flavor
I want it now and later

[Verse 1]
Up and down the streets of a no-name town
Me and her with the windows down
35s rolling on the ground
Loving every minute
Skoal peach in the side of the door
Coke cans rolling on the floor
No, I never wanted nothing more
Yeah, that was living

[Pre-Chorus 1]
I drove her to work, drove her to school
I drove her to PCB
I jacked it up, loaded it down
With all my friends and me

[Chorus]
I grew up in it
Yeah, I got stuck in it
Playin' our song on the stereo
Drivin' 'til we ran outta road
Yeah, I broke up in it
I fell in love in it
Made a lifetime full of memories
On a half tank of gasoline
I learned just who I wasn't and who I was
In that old truck, mmm
In that old truck

[Verse 2]
I found a field, I put it in park
Blanket and a girl and a billion stars
Midnight buzz and a racing heart
When I leaned in to kiss her
I wrecked it good on some old back road
Had to call daddy to get her towed
Cussing out all that grass I mowed
Just saving up to fix her

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Had some luck, fogged it up
And I ain't gonna lie
She heard me laugh, heard me cry
Heard me pray sometimes

[Chorus]
I grew up in it
Yeah, I got stuck in it
Playin' our song on the stereo
Drivin' 'til we ran out of road
Yeah, I broke up in it
I fell in love in it
Made a lifetime full of memories
On a half tank of gasoline
I learned just who I wasn't and who I was
In that old truck, mmm
Yeah, in that old truck (Yeah)

[Bridge]
Yeah, you might think it's crazy
And you might not understand
But that hand-me-down on four wheels
Turned this boy into a man

[Chorus]
Yeah, I grew up in it
I got stuck in it
Jamming our song on the stereo
Drivin' 'til we ran out of road
Yeah, I broke up in it
I fell in love in it
I made a lifetime full of memories
On a half tank of gasoline
Yeah, I learned who I wasn't and who I was
But yeah, whoever's got it now, I hope they love
That old truck, mmm
Yeah, that old truck
That old truck, mmm

[Verse 1]
Does your heart skip a beat when he kisses you, baby?
Yeah, I just gotta know for my peace of mind
Staying up all night 'cause it's driving me crazy
Tell me yes or no, either way, I'm fine

[Pre-Chorus]
Last time we talked, said you'd never been better
That's what you said, though, when we were together
Mine in July, but you're his in December

[Chorus]
I guess I was your gateway love
I didn't get you high enough
Kinda like an eighth grade crush that never lasts
Are you on that heavy stuff?
Tell me, did you find the one, find the one I thought I was?
But now I know that I was just your gateway love, baby
Yeah, I was your gateway love, baby

[Verse 2]
Was I just one piece of the puzzle you played?
Did you have your eye on a different prize?
Was it just another number on a whole other waitlist?
I knew it had to end, but it was sublime

[Pre-Chorus]
Last time we talked, said you'd never been better
That's what you said, though, when we were together
Mine in July, but you're his in December

[Chorus]
I guess I was your gateway love
I didn't get you high enough
Kinda like an eighth grade crush that never lasts
Are you on that heavy stuff?
Tell me, did you find the one, find the one I thought I was?
But now I know that I was just your gateway love, baby
Yeah, I was your gateway love, baby
Yeah, I was your gateway love, baby
Yeah, I was your gateway love, baby

[Bridge]
Does your heart skip a beat when he kisses you, baby?
'Cause I just gotta know for my peace of mind

[Chorus]
I guess I was your gateway love
I didn't get you high enough
Kinda like an eighth grade crush that never lasts
Are you on that heavy stuff?
Tell me, did you find the one, find the one I thought I was?
But now I know that I was just your gateway love, baby
Yeah, I was your gateway love, baby
Yeah, I was your gateway love, baby
Nothing but your gateway love, baby

[Verse 1]
You'll never walk on the ceiling
If you've never been flat on the floor
And you can't soak up the sun
If you've never been stuck in the storm
You can't find somebody
If you never let somebody else go
If you ain't hit a wall, you'll never find a window

[Chorus]
You can never go up
If you never been down, down, down
If you've never been lost
You won't ever get found, found, found
I remember what my mama told me
Ain't nobody in love who ain't never been lonely
You can never go up
If you never been down, down, down

[Post-Chorus]
La, ah
Ooh

[Verse 2]
You can't hear the angels singing
If you never played the devil a song (Whoa)
And you don't know what it's like to come back
If you never been gone
Yeah, you can't appreciate money
If you ain't been so broke, it ain't funny
We're all kids on a playground, sittin' on a seesaw
Hey, y'all

[Chorus]
You can never go up
If you never been down, down, down
If you've never been lost
You won't ever get found, found, found
I remember what my mama told me
Ain't nobody in love who ain't never been lonely
You can never go up
If you never been down, down, down

[Post-Chorus]
La, ah
Ooh

[Bridge]
Uh, you know what I'm saying
Na, na-na-na-na, na-na, na-na-na-na, na-na
Everything's gonna be alright
Na, na-na-na-na, na-na, na-na-na-na, na-na
Everything's gonna be alright, yeah
Na, na-na-na-na, na-na, na-na-na-na, na-na
Everything gonna be alright, I said
Na, na-na-na-na, na-na, na-na-na-na, na-na
Everything's gonna, everything's gonna be alright

[Chorus]
So put your hands up (Oh yeah)
If you never been down, down, down
If you've never been lost (Lost, oh yeah)
You won't ever get found, found, found
I remember what my mama told me (I remember what she told me)
Ain't nobody in love who ain't never been lonely
You can never go up (Oh)
If you never been down, down, down

[Post-Chorus]
(La, ah)
Everything's gonna, everything's gonna be alright
Said, yeah (Ooh)
Everything's gonna, everything's gonna be alright

[Verse 1]
Busy working hard, wrapped up in my job, we got bills to pay
Lately, when we talk, it feels like I don't hear a single word you say
Can we get back to the basics
And find that young love and make it?
And tear down all these walls
Ignore all of our calls and just stay in

[Chorus]
Kiss me like a stranger
Baby, hold me like we've never met
Every touch, a little danger
Like you ain't gotten used to me yet
Strike a match, light the fuse
You and I, we could use some reckless behavior
So, baby, kiss me like a stranger

[Verse 2]
Lightning on my skin
Every touch remembering what you mean to me, oh
Let me reminisce my lips on your lips
Like a symphony, you're playing on my heartstrings

[Chorus]
Kiss me like a stranger
Baby, hold me like we've never met
Every touch, a little danger
Like you ain't gotten used to me yet
Strike a match, light the fuse
You and I, we could use some reckless behavior
So, baby, kiss me like a stranger

[Bridge]
It's been a little crazy lately
Come on and remind me, baby
Well, girl, don't keep me waiting
Come on over my way and lay it on me

[Chorus]
And kiss me like a stranger
Baby, hold me like we've never met
Every touch, a little danger
Like you ain't gotten used to me yet
Strike a match, light the fuse
You and I, we could use some reckless behavior
So, baby, kiss me like a stranger

[Outro]
Ooh, won't you kiss me, won't you kiss me
Won't you kiss me like a stranger
Mmm, yeah, won't you kiss me like a stranger
Ooh, I got plans for you, I got plans for you
I got plans for you, I got plans for you
Kiss me like a stranger
You feeling now, ooh
You feeling now, ooh
You feeling now, ooh

[Verse 1]
When I got trucked on that old field, I almost quit that team
I almost gave up guitar 'cause it hurt to play those strings
When everybody told me no, man, I ’bout gave up on my dream
I almost let it go
I almost broke my leg riding dirt bike with no fear
I almost lost my best friend over some girl freshman year
I almost lost my license driving home after two beers
Almost, Lord knows
Oh, but when I look back now

[Chorus]
Thank God for the almost, thank God for the so close
Thank God for the night I came within an inch of that fence post
For the doors that open, for the ones that slam closed
Thank God for the girls I thought I'd marry, but left me heartbroke
Thank God for the highs, thank God for the lows
Thank God for the almost

[Verse 2]
I almost got that tattoo on my back that said "Delta Chi"
Almost didn't visit Granddad a week before he died
I almost didn’t kiss that girl, turned out to be my wife
Guess someone else had something else in mind

[Chorus]
Thank God for the almost, thank God for the so close
Thank God for the kick that came within an inch of that goal post
For the doors that open, for the ones that slam closed
Thank God for the girls I thought I'd marry, but left me heartbroke
Thank God for the highs, thank God for the lows
Thank God for the almost

[Chorus]
Thank God for the almost, thank God for the so close
Thank God for the right, not left, I took when I came to them crossroads
For the doors that open, for the ones that slam closed
Yeah, without 'em, where would I be? Man, I don't know
Thank God for the highs, thank God for the lows
Thank God for the almost
Oh, Thank God for the almost

[Verse 1]
Hey girl, you make me wanna write a song
Sit you down, I'll sing it to you all night long
I've had a melody in my head since she walked in here and knocked me dead
Yeah girl, you make me wanna write a song

[Chorus]
And it goes like ooh, what I wouldn't do
To write my name on your heart, get you wrapped in my arms baby, all around you
And it goes like hey, girl, I'm blown away
Yeah, it starts with a smile and it ends with an all night long slow kiss
Yeah, it goes like this

[Verse 2]
Hey girl, you make me wanna drive you home
Get you outta here and get you all alone
I don't know what it is about you, baby
But I'm all messed up and it might sound crazy
But you make me wanna write a song

[Chorus]
And it goes like ooh, what I wouldn't do
To write my name on your heart, get you wrapped in my arms baby, all around you
And it goes like hey, girl, I'm blown away
Yeah, it starts with a smile and it ends with an all night long slow kiss
Yeah, it goes like this

[Bridge]
Lookin' at you lookin' at me that way (Lookin' at me that way)
Makes me wanna grab my old guitar and play

[Chorus]
Something like ooh, what I wouldn't do
To write my name on my heart, get you wrapped in my arms
Baby, all around you
And it goes like hey, girl, I'm blown away
Yeah, it starts with a smile and it ends with an all night long slow kiss
Yeah, it goes like this

[Outro]
And it goes like ooh, and it goes like hey
And it ends with a kiss
Yeah, it goes like this

[Verse 1]
You'd move a mountain, move to New York
To a run down apartment you can barely afford
Ditch all of your plans to follow her dream
Knowing it might work out or fall apart at the seams

[Pre-Chorus]
You just wanna see her smile
You just wanna see her happy
Just wanna make her happy

[Chorus]
Things you do for love, things you do for love
Things you do for love
Things you do for love, things you do for love
Things you do for love
It's crazy

[Verse 2]
She'll buy you tickets, see a band she don't like
She'll watch you go crazy, she'll be beside you, rocking all night
She'll say you look handsome in that suit that don't fit
She'll laugh at a joke that both of you know she don't even get

[Pre-Chorus]
She just wants to see you smile
She just wants to see you happy
She just wants to make you happy, yeah

[Chorus]
Things you do for love, things you do for love
Things you do for love
Things you do for love, things you do for love
Things you do for love
Give your last breath, give your last name
Your umbrella in the pouring rain
Things you do for love, things you do for love
Things you do for love
It's crazy

[Bridge]
Well, she'll keep you grounded
And she'll make you fly
And she'll forgive you
Even though she already has a thousand times

[Chorus]
Things you do for love, things you do for love
Things you do for love
Things you do for love (Things you do for love)
Things you do for love, things you do for love
Things you do for love, things you do for love
Things you do for love
Give your last breath, give your last name
Your umbrella in the pouring rain
Things you do for love (Things you do for love)
Things you do for love, things you do for love
It's crazy

[Outro]
Things you do for love (The things you do for love)
Things you do for love (The things you do)
Things you do for love
The things you do for love, yeah
The things you do for love

[Verse 1: Thomas Rhett, Thomas Rhett & Little Big Town]
I got a hankerin' for doin’ somethin' crazy
Don't have to tell me, girl, yeah, I know that it’s Wednesday
But you're lookin' so good, it feels like Friday night, huh
That ripped up t-shirt makes me want you in the worst way
Just take a sip and let's pretend like it's your birthday
Just dive right in, girl, the tequila's fine, so fine
She said, "You know I love a party
Don't threaten me with a good time

[Chorus: Thomas Rhett & Little Big Town]
Hop on up on that counter
Let me see how you move
Let me up there beside ya
Stand back, watch me cut loose
Pour a little liquor, make this living room twirl
Watch me set this night on fire
Baby, you know I love a party
Don't threaten me with a good time

[Verse 2: Thomas Rhett & Karen Fairchild]
Girl, you know better than to think you can one-up me
You try to match me shot for shot, it’s gon’ get ugly
Boy, don't forget how I tore up those college Friday nights
Baby, you know I love a party
Don’t threaten me with a good time, no no
Here we go

[Chorus: Thomas Rhett & Little Big Town]
Hop on up on that counter
Let me see how you move
Let me up there beside ya
Stand back, watch me cut loose
Pour a little liquor, make this living room twirl
Watch me set this night on fire
Baby, you know I love a party
Don't threaten me with a good time

[Bridge: Thomas Rhett, Karen Fairchild & Both]
Baby, I been watchin' you dancin'
Boy, I been watchin’ you move
And I'm lovin' everything you do, baby
Ooh, I'm just gettin' started
Yeah, baby, me too
But no, I won't be asleep 'til 2, 3, 4 in the mornin'

[Chorus: Thomas Rhett & Little Big Town]
Hop on up on that counter
Let me see how you move
Let me up there beside ya
Stand back, watch me cut loose
Pour a little liquor, make this living room twirl
Watch me set this night on fire
Baby, you know I love a party
Don't threaten me with a good time

[Outro: Thomas Rhett]
Baby, you know I love a party
Don't threaten me with a good time

[Verse 1]
Poor boy, rich girl, what a cliché
One car, two hearts, wanna run away
'Cause they know it was meant to be
His little bullet in the shotgun seat
Poor boy, rich girl, bit like you and me
So come on

[Chorus]
Hey, yeah, I promise you your daddy gon' be alright
Oh, baby, you were such a good girl all your life
So what we cause a little trouble?
So what we don't sleep tonight?
Baby, I promise you your daddy's gonna be alright
Gonna be alright

[Verse 2]
Little renegade love out there on the run
Yeah, two innocent souls were the smoking gun
Yeah, they were living the American dream
His little beauty in some cut-off jeans, yeah
Small town cliché, bit like you and me
So come on

[Chorus]
Hey, yeah, I promise you your daddy gon' be alright
Oh, baby, you were such a good girl all your life
So what we cause a little trouble?
So what we don't sleep tonight?
Baby, I promise you your daddy's gonna be alright
Gonna be alright

[Bridge]
Well, they can tell you what to think, yeah
But they can't tell you who to love
So, baby, come along with me, leave it in the dust
Ay yeah, I promise you your daddy's gonna be alright
So come on

[Chorus]
Hey, yeah, I promise you your daddy gon' be alright
Oh, baby, you were such a good girl all your life
So what we cause a little trouble?
So what we don't sleep tonight?
Baby, I promise you your daddy's gonna be alright
Gonna be alright

[Outro]
He's gonna be alright, oh, baby
You've been a good girl all your life
He's gonna be alright

[Verse 1]
Waking up in my college dorm
Yeah, my life, it was pretty normal
Looking for a date to the spring formal
Wasn't worried 'bout nothing else, no
Majoring in Undecided
Notebook full of bad songs I was writing
Never dreamed anybody else would like them
Now they're sitting on a Walmart shelf

[Chorus]
Ain't it funny how life changes
You wake up, ain't nothing the same and life changes
You can't stop it, just hop on the train, and
You never know what's gonna happen
You make your plans and you hear God laughing
Life changes, and I wouldn't change it for the world, the world, oh no
And I wouldn't change it for the world, the world, oh no

[Verse 2]
I bought a ring and she said, "I do"
But everybody else said, "Man, you're twenty-two
Whatcha trying to prove? Hey, why don't you wait?"
'Cause I've been waiting on her since the second grade, yeah
And now she got her own set of fans
She got a blue check mark by her Instagram
And I wrote a little song about holding her hand
And now everybody wanna die a happy man

[Chorus]
Ain't it funny how life changes
You wake up ain't nothing the same and life changes
You can't stop it just hop on the train, and
You never know what's gonna happen
You make your plans and you hear God laughing
Life changes, and I wouldn't change it for the world, the world, oh no
And I wouldn't change it for the world, the world, oh no

[Verse 3]
I remember the day I told my Daddy and Mama
"You're gonna have a grandkid, yep
From Uganda, that's right, we're adopting
And she is the cutest little girl that you've ever seen"
Well I was wrapping my head around being a dad
A big wrench got thrown in the plans we thought we had
Now there's Willa, and sweet Ada James
Yeah that's two under two, now hey, what can I say?

[Chorus]
Ain't it funny how life changes
You wake up ain't nothing the same and life changes
You can't stop it, just hop on the train, and
You never know what's gonna happen
You make your plans and you hear God laughing
Life changes, and I wouldn't change it for the world, the world, oh no
And I wouldn't change it for the world, the world, oh no

[Verse 1]
The way your fingers fit in mine
It's five plus five, not rocket science
This day in time, that's hard to find, it's true
The road we're on ain't a traffic jam
It's a Sunday drive on a piece of land
It's paradise as long as I'm with you

[Chorus]
It's like one, two, three
Just as easy as can be
Just the way you look at me
You make me smile
Ain't no need to complicate it, we both know that's overrated
We've been there, it's safe to say it ain't our style
It's just that simple, S-I-M-P-L-E
Simple as can be
It's just that simple, S-I-M-P-L-E
Simple as can be

[Verse 2]
We used to live on Instagram
Worry 'bout who all gives a damn
'Bout where we've been and where we ended up
Then I met you and you met me
And all the rest is history
An epiphany that all we need is us

[Chorus]
It's like one, two, three
Just as easy as can be
Just the way you look at me
You make me smile
Ain't no need to complicate it, we both know that's overrated
We've been there, it's safe to say it ain't our style
We're just simple like a six string
The way this world was meant to be
Like laughin', love, make a lot out of a little
It's just that simple, S-I-M-P-L-E
Simple as can be
It's just that simple, S-I-M-P-L-E
Simple as can be

[Instrumental]

[Chorus]
Ain't no need to complicate it, we both know that's overrated
We've been there, it's safe to say it ain't our style, yeah
It's like one, two, three
Just as easy as can be
Just the way you look at me
You make me smile
Ain't no need to complicate it, we both know that's overrated
We've been there, it's safe to say it ain't our style
We're just simple like a six string
The way this world was meant to be
Like laughin', love, make a lot out of a little
It's just that simple, S-I-M-P-L-E
Simple as can be
It's just that simple, S-I-M-P-L-E
Simple as can be
It's just that simple, S-I-M-P-L-E
Simple as can be
It's just that simple, S-I-M-P-L-E
Simple as can be

[Verse 1]
When the sun had left and the winter came
And the sky fall to only bring the rain
I sat in darkness
All broken-hearted
I couldn't find a day I didn't feel alone
I never meant to cry, started losin' hope
But somehow, baby
You broke through and saved me

[Pre-Chorus]
You're an angel, tell me you're never leavin'
'Cause you're the first thing I know I can believe in

[Chorus]
You're holy, holy
Holy, holy
I'm high on lovin' you
High on lovin' you
You're holy, holy
Holy, holy
I'm high on lovin' you
High on lovin' you

[Verse 2]
You made the brightest days from the darkest nights
You're the river bank where I was baptized
Cleansed from the demons
That were killin' my freedom
Let me lay you down, give me to ya
Get you singin', babe, hallelujah
We'll be touchin'
We'll be touchin' heaven

[Pre-Chorus]
You're an angel, tell me you're never leavin'
'Cause you're the first thing I know I can believe in

[Chorus]
You're holy, holy
Holy, holy
I'm high on lovin' you
High on lovin' you
You're holy, holy
Holy, holy
I'm high on lovin' you
High on lovin' you

[Bridge]
I don't need the stars 'cause you shine for me
Like fire in my veins, you're my ecstasy
You're my ecstasy

[Chorus]
You're holy, holy
Holy, holy
I'm high on lovin' you
High on lovin' you
You're holy, holy
Holy, holy
I'm high on lovin' you
High on lovin' you

[Outro]
You're the healin' hands where it used to hurt
You're my savin' grace, you're my kind of church
You're holy

[Intro]
Baby, you a song
You make me wanna roll my windows down and cruise
Hey baby

[Verse 1]
Yeah, when I first saw that bikini top on her
She’s poppin' right out of the South Georgia water
Thought, "Oh, good lord, she had them long tanned legs"
Couldn't help myself, so I walked up and said

[Chorus]
Baby, you a song
You make me wanna roll my windows down and cruise
Down a back road blowin' stop signs through the middle
Every little farm town with you
In this brand new Chevy with a lift kit
Would look a hell of a lot better with you up in it
So baby, you a song
You make me wanna roll my windows down and cruise

[Verse 2]
She was sippin' on Southern and singin' Marshall Tucker
We were fallin' in love in the sweet heart of summer
She hopped right up into the cab of my truck and said
"Fire it up, let's go get this thing stuck"

[Chorus]
Baby, you a song
You make me wanna roll my windows down and cruise
Down a back road blowin' stop signs through the middle
Every little farm town with you
In this brand new Chevy with a lift kit
Would look a hell of a lot better with you up in it
So baby, you a song
You make me wanna roll my windows down and cruise

[Verse 3]
When that summer sun fell to its knees
I looked at her and she looked at me
And I turned on those KC lights and drove all night
Because it felt so right, her and I, man, we felt so right

[Verse 4]
I put it in park and grabbed my guitar
And strummed a couple chords
And sang from the heart
Girl, you sure got the beat in my chest bumpin'
Hell, I can't get you out of my head

[Interlude]
Baby, you a song
You make me wanna roll my windows down and cruise
Down a back road blowin' stop signs through the middle
Every little farm town with you

[Chorus]
Baby, you a song
You make me wanna roll my windows down and cruise
Down a back road blowin' stop signs through the middle
Every little farm town with you
In this brand new Chevy with a lift kit
Would look a hell of a lot better with you up in it (Come on)
So baby, you a song
You make me wanna roll my windows down and cruise

[Outro]
Come on, girl
Get those windows down and cruise
Aww, yeah

[Verse 1]
Girl, I know you had a long day
You ain't feelin' them downtown lights
But I got a bottle at your favorite place
Just waitin' for us in a bucket on ice
Damn, I didn't think it'd be that easy
'Cause now you're gettin' ready
I'm just sittin' there watchin' TV
Here you come lookin' like a grown man's dream
Damn, I can't believe, I can't believe

[Chorus]
I talked you into slippin' down the hall, baby, turn it on
Your playlist you play when you're in the shower
Talked you into taking up my time, making up your mind
Switching back and forth for an hour
And now you're lookin' like a line from a Vandross song
I'm looking at that fine little dress you got on
Don't get me wrong, girl, I love it
Now I just wanna talk you out of it

[Verse 2]
Yeah, as cool as it would be
Watchin' people wonder who you are
Oh, we should just say we did, we can start with a kiss
And pretend we just got back from the bar

[Chorus]
I talked you into slippin' down the hall, baby, turn it on
Your playlist you play when you're in the shower
Talked you into taking up my time, making up your mind
Switching back and forth for an hour
And now you're lookin' like a line from a Vandross song
I'm looking at that fine little dress you got on
Don't get me wrong, girl, I love it
Now I just wanna talk you out of it

[Bridge]
Yeah, it's a little cold outside
Music's probably way too loud
To hear you laugh
And there's a look in your eyes
Looks like we ain't leavin' now
Girl, I'm so glad, I'm so glad

[Chorus]
I talked you into slippin' down the hall, baby, turn it on
Your playlist you play when you're in the shower
Talked you into taking up my time, making up your mind
Switching back and forth for an hour
And now you're lookin' like a line from a Vandross song
I'm looking at that fine little dress you got on
Don't get me wrong, girl, I love it
Now I just wanna talk you out of it

[Verse 1: Florida Georgia Line]
The mixtapes got a little Hank, little Drake
A little somethin' bumpin', thumb thumpin' on the wheel right
The mix in our drinks, a little stronger than you think
So get a grip, take a sip of that feel right
Trucks jacked up, flat bills flipped back
Yeah, you can find us where the party's at

[Chorus: Florida Georgia Line]
This is how we roll, whoa, whoa
We hangin' 'round, singin' down everything on the radio
Whoa, whoa
We light it up with our hands up
This is how we roll, this is how we do
We're burning down the night, shootin' bullets at the moon, baby
This is how we roll, whoa, whoa

[Verse 2: Florida Georgia Line]
Yeah, baby, this is how we roll
We rollin' into town with nothin' else to do
We take another lap around
Yeah, holla at your boy if you need a ride
If you roll with me, yeah, you know we rollin' high
Up on them 37 Nittos, windows tinted, hard to see though
How fresh my baby is in the shotgun seat oh
Them kisses are for me though, automatic like a free throw
This life I live, it might not be for you, but it's for me though
(Let's roll!)

[Chorus: Florida Georgia Line]
This is how we roll, whoa, whoa
We hangin' 'round, singin' down everything on the radio
Whoa, whoa
We light it up with our hands up
This is how we roll, this is how we do
When the world turns ugly, I just turn and look at you, baby
This is how we roll, whoa

[Guitar Solo]

[Bridge: Luke Bryan & Florida Georgie Line]
And we gonna sing it to 'em
Yeah, we're proud to be young
We stick to our guns
We love who we love and we wanna have fun
Yeah, we cuss on them Mondays
And pray on them Sundays
Pass it around and we dream about one day

[Chorus: Luke Byran & Florida Georgie Line]
'Cause this is how we roll... (Come on, yall)
We hangin' 'round, singin' out everything on the radio, whoa, whoa
(Get your hands up, get your hands up, get your hands up)
We light it up with our hands up (Aww, yeah)
This is how we roll, this is how we ride
We slangin' up the mud, cuttin' through the country side, baby
This is how we roll, whoa, whoa

[Outro: Florida Georgie Line & Luke Bryan]
Yeah, this is how we roll (This is how we roll)
(Yeah, baby, yeah, we'll be, lets go)
(Yeah, this is how we roll) This how we roll
This is how we do
We burnin' down the night, shootin' bullets at the moon
(Aww, yeah)
Baby, this is how we roll, whoa, whoa (BK, Tyler)
(One more time boys, let’s go)
Yeah, this is how we roll (This is how we roll, whoa, whoa)

[Verse 1: Florida Georgia Line]
May we all get to grow up in a red, white, and blue little town
Get a won't-start, hand-me-down Ford to try to fix up
With some part time cash from driving a tractor
Find a sweet little thang, wears your ball cap backwards
Kinda place you can't wait to leave but nobody does
'Cause you miss it too much

[Chorus: Florida Georgia Line]
May we all know that nothing ain't cool 'til you wear the new off
The sound of a quarter rollin' down a jukebox
Play the Travis Tritt right above the 2Pac
Hope you get lost down some road
Slow rolling with the top off the back of a Bronco
Buy a cold sixer with a cashed in lotto
She's smilin' with her hair blowing out the window
Where you 'bout to go?
Yeah you learn to fly and if you can't then you just freefall
May we all

[Verse 2: Tim McGraw]
May we all get to see those fields of green turn gold
Watch a marching band play with the harvest moon coming up
And know that fifteen minutes of famous
Ain't gonna be what makes us or breaks us but
We'll all be watching the TV the day that it comes

[Chorus: Florida Georgia Line (Brian Kelley)]
May we all know that nothing ain't cool 'til you wear the new off
The sound of a quarter rollin' down a jukebox
Play the Travis Tritt right above the 2Pac
'Fore you get lost down some road
Slow rolling with the top off the back of a Bronco
Buy a cold sixer with a cashed in lotto
She's smilin' with her hair blowing out the window
Where you 'bout to go?
Yeah you learn to fly and if you can't then you just freefall
May we all

[Verse 3: Both]
May we all do a little bit better than the first time
Learn a little something from the worst times
Get a little stronger from the hurt times
May we all get to have a chance to ride the fast one
Walk away wiser when we crashed one
Keep hoping that the best one is the last one

[Outro]
Yeah you learn to fly and if you can't then you just freefall
May we all
May we all
May we all
May we all
May we all
May we all (get to have a chance to ride the fast one)
May we all (walk away wiser when we crashed one)
May we all (keep hoping that the best one is the last one)
(yeah the last one)
Yeah you learn to fly and if you can't then you just freefall
May we all

[Verse 1: Florida Georgia Line]
That Sunday morning choir calling, church doors open wide
That hallelujah, shoot right through ya, make you feel alive
That key under the mat, you know right where it's at
It's waiting with the porch light on
Don't bother calling, no need for knocking, just come on home
Come on home, my love is

[Chorus: Florida Georgia Line & Backstreet Boys]
Never gonna run dry, never gonna come up empty
Now until the day I die, unconditionally
You know I'm always gonna be here for ya
No one's ever gonna love you more than
God, your mama, and me
God, your mama, and me
Unconditionally, God, your mama, and me

[Verse 2: Nick Carter]
Loud as shotgun, angels singing with the radio
Praying with you every mile down any dead end road
You can tell me every secret that you been keeping
I'll hold it, lock and key
Up with you all night, holding you all night, I never leave
You better believe my love is

[Chorus: Florida Georgia Line & Backstreet Boys]
Never gonna run dry, never gonna come up empty
Now until the day I die, unconditionally
You know I'm always gonna be here for ya
No one's ever gonna love you more than
God, your mama, and me
God, your mama, and me
Unconditionally, God, your mama, and me
You better believe it, you better believe it

[Bridge: AJ McLean]
Every step you take, I'll be as sure as your shadow
Every move you make, you know I'll follow you wherever you go
Baby, you know my love is

[Chorus: Florida Georgia Line & Backstreet Boys]
Never gonna run dry, never gonna come up empty
Now until the day I die, unconditionally (unconditionally)
You know I'm always gonna be here for ya
No one's ever gonna love you more than
God, your mama, and me
God, your mama, and me
Unconditionally, God, your mama, and me

[Outro: Florida Georgia Line & Backstreet Boys]
God, your mama, and me
God, your mama, and me
Unconditionally, God your mama, and me

[Verse 1]
Smooth
Like a Tennessee Walker
Just a walking on the water
You're smooth
Like a Sunday morning Elvis singing Gospel
It's a hell of a
Groove
Like the lines on her Mercury
Girl, you're put together perfectly

[Chorus]
Good lord almighty
Girl, you go down good
You ain't even trying
'Cause you wrote the book
There ain't nobody
That do me like you
The way you move that body
Girl, you're so smooth

[Verse 2]
Like cat daddy driving a caddy from Cali, baby
You're smooth
Like young love buzzing
Off an Old Camp bottle by the
Moon
Blackberry jam, finger-licking
Off your hand flying out the window

[Chorus]
Good lord almighty
Girl, you go down good
You ain't even trying
'Cause you wrote the book
There ain't nobody (There ain't nobody)
That do me like you (Do me like you)
The way you move that body (The way you move that body)
Girl, you're so smooth (So smooth)
Smooth, smooth

[Bridge]
You're a stroke on the canvas
A brick road to Kansas
My little summer time jam (Jam, jam)

[Chorus]
Good lord almighty
Girl, you go down good
You ain't even trying
'Cause you wrote the book
There ain't nobody (There ain't nobody)
That do me like you (Do me like you)
The way you move that body (The way you move that body)
Girl, you're so smooth (So smooth)
Smooth, smooth (You so smooth)
Smooth

[Verse 1]
Hammerin' a nail, stackin' them bales
I'm dog tired by the 5 o'clock hour
But I'm ready to raise some hell
And Jesse's gettin' ready, I'm gassin' up the Chevy
I'm gonna pick her up at six
I hope she's gonna wear the jeans with the tear
That her mama never fixed

[Chorus]
The moon comes up and the sun goes down
We find a little spot on the edge of town
Twist off, sip a little, pass it around
Dance in the dust, turn the radio up
And that fireball whiskey whispers
Temptation in my ear
It's a feelin' alright Saturday night
And that's how we do it 'round here
Yeah, that's how we do it 'round here

[Verse 2]
Mud on the grips, wild cherry on her lips
I've been workin' and tryin' and flirtin' and dyin'
For an all night kinda kiss
And country on the boombox, candles on the tool box
I'm doin' everything right, got the country boy charm
Turned all the way on tonight

[Chorus]
Yeah, the moon comes up and the sun goes down
We find a little spot on the edge of town
Twist off, sip a little, pass it around
Dance in the dust, turn the radio up
And that fireball whiskey whispers
Temptation in my ear
It's a feelin' alright, Saturday night
And that's how we do it 'round here
Yeah, that's how we do it 'round here

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
Yeah, the moon comes up and the sun goes down
We find a little spot on the edge of town
Twist off, sip a little, pass it around
Dance in the dust, turn the radio up
And that fireball whiskey whispers
Temptation in my ear
It's a feelin' alright, Saturday night
And that's how we do it 'round here
Yeah, that's how we do it 'round here (Come on)

[Outro]
Yeah, that's how we do it round here
Yeah, that's how we do it round here

[Intro: Music Video Only]
I'll tell you something, 1968 was just another year, the fields needed tilling and there wasn't enough rain. But it was the first year Rosie started bringing my lunch out to the field every day

[Verse 1]
You get your hands in it
Plant your roots in it
Dusty headlight, dance with your boots in it (Dirt)
You write her name on it
Spin your tires on it
Build your corn field, whiskey, bonfires on it (Dirt)
You bet your life on it, yeah
It's that...

[Chorus]
Elm shade, red rust clay you grew up on
That plowed up ground, that your dad damned his luck on
That post game party field you circle up on
And when it rains you get stuck on
Drift a cloud back behind county roads that you run up
And mud on her jeans that she peeled off and hung up
Her blue-eyed summertime smile looks so good that it hurts
Makes you wanna build a 10 percent down white picket fence house on this dirt

[Music Video Interlude 1]
Rosie and I had five children, one died at birth, they were tough times, tough years, did okay

[Verse 2]
You've mixed some sweat with it
Taking a shovel to it
You've stuck some crosses and some painted
Goal posts through it (Dirt)
You know you came from it (Dirt)
And some day you'll return to...

[Chorus ]
Elm shade, red rust clay you grew up on
That plowed up ground, that your dad damned his luck on
That post game party field you circle up on
And when it rains you get stuck on
Drift a cloud back behind county roads that you run up
And mud on her jeans that she peeled off and hung up
Her blue-eyed summertime smile looks so good that it hurts
Makes you wanna build a 10 percent down white picket fence house on this dirt

[Music Video Interlude 2]
I asked Rosie one time if she wanted to travel to see the world, and no she said "the world comes right to my window every day"... Even if it's broken
(You know you came from it (dirt, dirt) And some day you'll return to)

[Chorus]
Elm shade, red rust clay you grew up on
That plowed up ground, that your dad damned his luck on
That post game party field you circle up on
And when it rains, you get stuck on
Drift a cloud back behind county roads that you run up
And mud on her jeans that she peeled off and hung up
Her blue-eyed summertime smile looks so good that it hurts
Makes you wanna build a 10 percent down white picket fence house on this dirt

[Post-Chorus]
Makes you wanna build a 10 percent down white picket fence house on this dirt

[Music Video Interlude 3]
See Rosie was right about two things: you don't have to see the world to be worldly, just raise good children, bake good enough pies and the world will come right to your kitchen window. She's right about something else too, I built that baseball diamond way too close to the kitchen

[Outro]
(You know you came from it
And some day, you'll return to it)

[Verse 1]
Strawberry shimmer on hot lips
Silver buckle hangin' off her hips
Eyes sparkle when she smiles
Shinedown on the radio dial
Homemade jar of lemon drop, take a sip
Don't stop, girl, you know I love it when you

[Chorus]
Get your shine on
'Cause you and me be rockin' all night long
Summer sky drippin' rhinestones
Turn your party lights on
Baby, get your shine on, shine on
Baby, get your shine on

[Verse 2]
Silverado, candy painted
Ray-Bans got the whole world shaded
Chrome piece tucked in the console
Ridin' high, roll up on the down low
Feelin' lucky, got hooked up with some Kentucky clear
So slide that little sugar shaker over here

[Chorus]
And get your shine on
'Cause you and me be rockin' all night long
Summer sky drippin' rhinestones
Turn your party lights on
Baby, get your shine on, shine on
Baby, get your shine on

[Bridge]
Homemade jar of lemon drop, take a sip
Don't stop, girl

[Chorus]
You know I love it when you get your shine on
'Cause you and me be rockin' all night long
Summer sky drippin' rhinestones
Turn your party lights on
Baby, get your shine on, shine on
Baby, get your shine on
'Cause you and me be rockin' all night long
Summer sky drippin' rhinestones
Turn your party lights on
Baby, get your shine on, shine on
Baby, get your shine on
Baby, get your shine on

[Outro]
Strawberry shimmer on hot lips
Silver buckle hangin' off her hips
Eyes sparkle when she smiles
Shinedown on the radio dial
Silverado, candy painted
Ray-Bans got the whole world shaded
Chromed piece tucked in the console
Riding high, roll up on the down low
Baby, get your shine on

[Intro]
Alabama on the boombox, baby
‘Bout to get a little boondock crazy
You're gonna wanna turn this one up
Feels good, don't it?

[Verse 1]
Big stars breakin' out through the indigo
Chevy wind comin' in in stereo
Tail lights disappear in 'bout a mile or so
Down the county road
Phone blowin' up "Where you is?"
Baby, sayin' "Baby, let's do this"
Rocket in a bottle with the fuse lit
'Bout to lift it off, I'm 'bout to twist it off

[Chorus]
Lime on the rim of that dixie silver
Smokin' up a faded out 4x4
Girls headin' off to the river, yeah
Victoria's Secret ain't a secret no more
I brought the songs and who brought the party
Only one way to do it up right
Everybody goes where everybody knows
That anything goes on a Friday night
Get your party right, it's a Friday night
Get your party right, it's a Friday night

[Verse 2]
Well, baby, you ain't nothin but a masterpiece
Swayin' and sippin' that Dos Equis
Losin' yourself in the big loud beat, nothin' but heat (Come on)
Somebody's rockin' that bang box
Everybody hittin' that sweet spot
Nobody mindin' that tick tock
Gettin' all locked in with all my friends

[Chorus]
Lime on the rim of that dixie silver
Smokin' up a faded out 4x4
Girls headin' off to the river, yeah
Victoria's Secret ain't a secret no more
I brought the songs and who brought the party
Only one way to do it up right
Everybody goes where everybody knows
That anything goes on a Friday night
Get your party right, it's a Friday night
Get your party right, it's a Friday night

[Bridge]
Alabama on the boombox, baby
'Bout to get a little boondock crazy
Hop on, it's a helluva ride
'Cause anything goes on a Friday night
Alabama on the boombox, baby
'Bout to get a little boondock crazy
Hop on, it's a helluva ride
'Cause anything goes on a Friday night (Come on)
Come on, y'all, lets go

[Chorus]
Lime on the rim of that dixie silver
Smokin' up a faded out 4x4
Girls headin' off to the river, yeah
Victoria's Secret ain't a secret no more
I brought the songs and who brought the party
Only one way to do it up right
Everybody goes where everybody knows
That anything goes on a Friday night
Get your party right, it's a Friday night
Get your party right, it's a Friday night
Get your party right, it's a Friday night (Come on, baby)
Get your party right, it's a Friday night
Anything goes on a Friday Night

[Outro]
Alabama on the boombox, baby
Bout to get a little boondock crazy

[Verse 1]
I'd sell my soul just to see your face
And I'd break my bones just to heal your pain
In these times I need a saving grace
But time is running out and I'm starting to lose my faith

[Chorus]
But if I told you I loved you, would it make you wanna stay?
I'm sorry for the way I hurt you, and making you walk away
(I shoulda took the time to tell you)
And if I wrote you a love song, and sang it to you every day
Would it ever be enough
To make you wanna come back home and stay?
(I can't go another day without you)
Would it make you, make you wanna stay?
(Girl, you gotta know I love you)

[Verse 2]
My heart's on my sleeve, but it's turning black
(I guess I know what it feels like it to be alone)
Without your touch, I'm not gonna last
(I know you know that I need you just to carry on)
It feels like my walls are caving in
(You always wanted it more, I left you hangin' on)
And I'll do anything to have you here again

[Chorus]
But if I told you I loved you, would it make you wanna stay?
I'm sorry for the way I hurt you, and making you walk away
(I shoulda took the time to tell you)
And if I wrote you a love song, and sang it to you every day
Would it ever be enough
To make you wanna come back home and stay?
(I can't go another day without you)

[Verse 3]
Yeah, the days are cold, the nights are long
And I can't stand to be alone
Please know this is not your fault
And all I want is to tell you I love you, and make you wanna stay
There's gotta be a way
'Cause goin' on without you is killing me everyday

[Chorus]
And if I wrote you a love song, and sang it to you every day
Would it ever be enough
To make you wanna come back home and stay?
(I can't go another day without you)
Would it make you, make you wanna stay?
(Girl, you gotta know I love you)
Would it make you, make you wanna stay?
(I can't go another day without you)
Would it make you, make you wanna stay?

[Verse 1]
That sunset's straight up as it gets
Short shorts restin' just right on your hips
Kiss chillin' on your lips
I'm for sure gonna get it in a minute
First time I take another sip
That Chevrolet sittin' in the driveway
Is gonna stay sittin', girl, we ain't gettin' anywhere, but closer
I know you're in the mood with literally nothing but each other on the to-do list

[Chorus]
We got all damn day to do it our way
Like an old tire swing in the shade
Got it made in the sweet spot
Baby, you and me got a couple free seats on a cloud nine ride
Don't matter if we're sittin' on the porch, in the car, at a bar
Or a boat down in Panama City
Gonna be a hell of a view
I'm just fine long as I'm sittin' next to you sittin' pretty, yeah
I'm sittin' pretty good
I'm sittin' pretty

[Verse 2]
Everything is feeling like it should
Don't think that it could, get any better
But this weather I wish it would
Turn up the heat, couple degrees
Get you in that AC, let down them blinds
Call it a day

[Chorus]
We got all damn day to do it our way
Like an old tire swing in the shade
Got it made in the sweet spot
Baby, you and me got a couple free seats on a cloud nine ride
Don't matter if we're sittin' on the porch, in the car, at a bar
Or a boat down in Panama City
Gonna be a hell of a view
I'm just fine long as I'm sittin' next to you sittin' pretty, yeah
I'm sittin' pretty, good
I'm sittin' pretty, damn
I'm sittin' pretty, good

[Bridge]
Pretty as a peach
As a postcard picture of a West Coast beach
So pretty, if I had to bet
This is pretty much as good as it gets

[Chorus]
We got all damn day to do it our way
Like an old tire swing in the shade
Got it made in the sweet spot
Baby, you and me got a couple free seats on a cloud nine ride (A cloud nine ride)
Don't matter if we're sittin' on the porch, in the car, at a bar (A car or a bar)
Or a boat down in Panama City (Panama City)
Gonna be a hell of a view
I'm just fine long (I'm gon' be fine, yeah) as I'm sittin' next to you sittin' pretty, yeah
(I'm sittin' pretty, good)
I'm sittin' pretty, good
I'm sittin' pretty, yeah
(I'm sittin' pretty, good)
I'm sittin' pretty, good
(I'm gon' be fine, yeah)
I'm sittin' pretty, yeah
(I'm sittin' pretty, good)
I'm sittin' pretty, good

[Intro: Jason Derulo]
Yeah yeah, yeah yeah, yeah yeah
Yeah yeah, yeah yeah, yeah yeah
Yeah yeah, yeah yeah

[Verse 1: Florida Georgia Line & Jason Derulo]
Well, starting out, the only one you love is mama
Then you start growin' up and wonderin'
What made the girls start gettin' pretty
Then you start carin' 'bout how you're lookin'
Anything it takes to get 'em lookin'
Thinkin', "Damn, I gotta get one with me" (Ooh)

[Chorus: Florida Georgia Line & Jason Derulo]
Women, God-given women
The reason we're livin' and lovin' this life, hallelujah
Women, beautiful women
We're all better off with 'em right by our side (Ooh)

[Verse 2: Jason Derulo]
Yeah, yeah
16, you get them keys to the ride
Clean it up, gotta make it shine
Just to pick her up for the first time, yeah yeah, yeah
Some girls come and go before you know it
Learn more with every hand you holding
Just to getcha ready for the one that's right
Yeah, yeah

[Chorus: Florida Georgia Line & Jason Derulo]
Women, God-given women
The reason we're livin' and lovin' this life, hallelujah
Women, beautiful women
We're all better off with 'em right by our side
Singin' oh

[Post-Chorus: Florida Georgia Line, Jason Derulo & Both]
Oh, so beautiful
Singin' oh
Oh, oh, so, so beautiful
Bring it on down

[Chorus: Florida Georgia Line, Jason Derulo & Both]
Women, sweet, sweet women (Sweet women)
You keep the world spinnin' and love in our eyes
That's what you do (Talkin' 'bout)
Women, beautiful women
We're all better off with 'em (Woo) right by our side
Something' 'bout them, can't live without them

[Post-Chorus: Florida Georgia Line, Jason Derulo & Both]
Oh, so beautiful
Said they're oh, oh, oh, oh
Yeah, they're so, oh, oh, oh
So beautiful
So let me hear you say
Oh, so beautiful
So beautiful, so beautiful
So beautiful, so perfectly beautiful
Said you're beautiful (Ooh)

[Outro: Jason Derulo]
Wanna thank you (Yeah yeah)
Wanna thank you (Yeah yeah, yeah yeah, ooh)
Let me thank, let me thank you (Yeah yeah, yeah yeah, yeah yeah)

[Verse 1]
Rusty barbed wire lines these fields
Gravel dust behind the wheels
Driftin' like my mind into the rearview
Jet trails cuttin' cross the sky
I'm rollin' through the open wide
Searchin' for a song to drink a beer to
And tryin' to find a place to disappear to

[Chorus]
I light up the night and let it burn
Lean back and watch a sundown fade
Do what I do when life's a little sideways
I take a sip and say a prayer
Wait for a shootin' star and stare
Off at the headlights on the highway
That guy in the windshield lookin' back looks just like me
But there's a crack in the reflection
This is just a moonlight soaked, ring of smoke
Right hand on a cold one confession

[Verse 2]
Embers in the ashtray glow like memories that won't let go
I'm out here tryin' to get 'em untangled
In the darkness on the edge of town
A little lost, a little found
Waitin' on a call from an angel

[Chorus]
I light up the night and let it burn
Lean back and watch a sundown fade
Do what I do when life's a little sideways
I take a sip and say a prayer
Wait for a shootin' star and stare
Off at the headlights on the highway
That guy in the windshield lookin' back looks just like me
But there's a crack in the reflection
This is just a moonlight soaked, ring of smoke
Right hand on a cold one confession

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
I light up the night and let it burn
Lean back and watch a sundown fade
Do what I do when life's a little sideways
I take a sip and say a prayer
Wait for a shootin' star and stare
Off at the headlights on the highway
That guy in the windshield looking back looks just like me
But there's a crack in the reflection
Hope he's movin' in the right direction
This is just a moonlight soaked, ring of smoke
Right hand on a cold one confession

[Verse 1]
First time I met you, knew I never could forget you, girl
You always saw the blue skies past the rain clouds in my eyes
There's music in your laughter from the floor up to the rafters
You're that happy ever after I've been after my whole life

[Chorus]
Who knows where I'd be without you?
No, I just couldn't be without you
I'll just say "Amen"
I can count 'em on one hand
But honey, look there on your finger
I'd say I'm a lucky man
God made two lovers out of strangers
A little house on a little land
A little creek, a little Jeep
Same old moon everybody sees
It sure ain't hard to count your blessings

[Verse 2]
Yesterday we celebrated our first year together
And together still feels better than that first night we met
I never dreamed that you could be so perfectly created, girl
He made a perfect angel
And he made you just for me

[Chorus]
Who knows where I'd be without you?
No, I just couldn't be without you
I'll just say "Amen"
I can count 'em on one hand
But honey, look there on your finger
I'd say I'm a lucky man
God made two lovers out of strangers
A little house on a little land
A little creek, a little Jeep
Same old moon everybody sees
It sure ain't hard to count your blessings

[Outro]
No, I can't count 'em on both hands
But honey, look here at this picture
I'd say we're a lucky fam
I'm thankful to be with you
A little house on a little land
Couple kids, two or three
Same old song that we'll always sing
It sure ain't hard to count your blessings
Always take time to count your blessings

[Intro]
Alright
Make you wanna dance, don't it, baby?

[Verse 1]
I'm gonna wear my flip-flops and
I'm gonna play some flip-cup and
Rock a little bit of hip-hop and Haggard and Jagger
And throw a 20 on the corn hole game
If I'm lucky, yeah, I might get laid
The way that it's goin', the keg gon' be floatin'

[Chorus]
All I wanna do today is wear my favorite shades and get stoned
Work a little less, play a little more
That's what this day is for
And all I wanna do is lace my J's and lace some Jack in my Coke
Work on my laid back, ain't nothin' wrong
With gettin' my sun daze on
Gettin' my sun daze on

[Verse 2]
Girl, you know you're the life of my party
You can stay and keep sippin' Bacardi
Stir it up as we turn on some Marley
If you want you can pet on my Harley
I sit you up on a kitchen sink
Stick the pink umbrella in your drink
The way that we're feelin', we gone by this evenin'

[Chorus]
All I wanna do today is wear my favorite shades and get stoned
Work a little less, play a little more
That's what this day is for
And all I wanna do is lace my J's and lace some Jack in my Coke
Work on my laid back, ain't nothin' wrong
With gettin' my sun daze on
Gettin' my sun daze on

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
All I wanna do today is wear my favorite shades and get stoned
Work a little less, play a little more
That's what this day is for
And all I wanna do is lace my J's and lace some Jack in my Coke
Work on my laid back, ain't nothin' wrong
With gettin' my sun daze on
Gettin' my sun daze on
Gettin' my sun daze on

[Verse 1]
Tell me that you love me
Say we'll always work it out
I know it's kinda scary but it's only temporary doubt
I've done a lot of stupid things
But promise that you're gonna stay long enough
To grow old with me

[Verse 2]
We're gonna see the good times
Love each other through the bad
It's gonna hurt like hell when we lose our moms and dads
So let my shoulder hold your tears
Walk beside me through the years
Baby, let's see where this love can lead

[Chorus]
Let's hold hands on your favorite beach
Fix up a house that we found in the city limits
Tangled up in a satin sheet
And get a little loud when we've had too much to drink
And learn to love from a church pew
Laugh about all the times we counted pennies
Buy some land with a good view to start family
Baby grow old with me

[Verse 3]
It's gonna take a little time
We'll have to work at it every day
We're gonna lose a lot of sleep
And learn to eat out of a microwave
You know we'll probably never have it all
But that's part of buildin' up the wall
Strong enough to stand up through the rain

[Chorus]
We'll make some love on your favorite beach
Add to the house that we found in the city limits
Talk our babies through the bad dreams
When they get a little older we'll tell them not to drink
Book a church when she finds a groom
Laugh about all the times they'll count the pennies
Give em land with a good view to start a family

[Verse 4]
And baby you know we might
Take a turn on a bad road
Maybe go where the wind blows, baby
But end up right where we were meant to be, yeah
Back and forth on a porch swing
Hard not to smile thinkin' how it don't get much better
Our baby's baby's turnin' 18
What a family, hmmm

[Outro]
Baby grow old with me
Baby grow old with me
Baby grow old with me
Tell me that you love me
Say we'll always work it out

[Chorus]
Well I got friends from Colorado
I got friends from Tennessee
So I got something in a bottle
And I got something from a seed
Since you said you didn't love me
Since you hung me out to dry
I've been drunk up in the Smokies
On a Rocky Mountain high

[Verse]
Made the plans, booked the day, spent the money too
Nothing sweet 'bout a paid-for honeymoon
Million dollar view to see but she won't
Since "I do" turned right into "I don't"
So I'm chillin' in a cabin at the tip-top
Lookin' at a holler full of hemlocks
No cars, no bars on my phone
And just when you think I'm all alone

[Chorus]
I got friends from Colorado
I got friends from Tennessee
So I got something in a bottle
And I got something from a seed
Since you said you didn't love me
Since you hung me out to dry
I've been drunk up in the Smokies
On a Rocky Mountain high

[Bridge]
These Appalachian folks
Probably think I'm losing it in these trees
Yeah, but they don't know
What kind of company I keep, yeah

[Instrumental]

[Chorus]
Well I got friends from Colorado
I got friends from Tennessee
So I got something in a bottle
And I got something from a seed
Since you said you didn't love me
Since you hung me out to dry
I've been drunk up in the Smokies
On a Rocky Mountain high
I've been drunk up in the Smokies
On a Rocky Mountain high (Ooh)

[Outro]
Jack's still on the hill 'cause Jill ran away
But Jill's got nothin' on Jack, and Jane

[Verse 1]
She's a little red wine, he's a little bit whiskey smoke
He's a ragged on the edge, she's keeping him holding out hope
She's a front pew hallelujah, drop another 20 in the plate
He's on the back row a little hung over, bout 20 minutes late

[Chorus]
She's a good girl, sky blue turquoise
Fallin' for a bad boy, drivin' that Detroit
Big block, cruisin' up the black top
Turnin' up a corn row, scare crow, farm house gravel road
Comin' for a good girl, countin' down the sun set
Never been broke heart, racin' like a Corvette
Got a little wildfire burnin' in her angel eyes
Probably ain't never been lost after midnight
Tryin' to be a good girl, but fallin' for a bad boy
Tryin' to be a good girl, but fallin' for a bad boy

[Verse 2]
Well she's sundress cotton, he's grease on a Carhartt shirt
And she's a candle in the wind, he's a light it up and let it burn
And every time she's with him, all she wants to do is kiss him
Starts thinking maybe she can fix him
He's thinkin' he'd love to let her try

[Chorus]
She's a good girl, sky blue turquoise
Fallin' for a bad boy, drivin' that Detroit
Big block, cruisin' up the black top
Turnin' up a corn row, scare crow, farm house gravel road
Comin' for a good girl, countin' down the sun set
Never been broke heart, racin' like a Corvette
Got a little wildfire burnin' in her angel eyes
Probably ain't never been lost after midnight
Tryin' to be a good girl, but fallin' for a bad boy
Tryin' to be a good girl, but fallin' for a bad boy

[Bridge]
And every time she's with him
She knows she prolly oughta quit him
But he don't wanna let her get away

[Chorus]
She's a good girl, sky blue turquoise
Fallin' for a bad boy, drivin' that Detroit
Big block, cruisin' up the black top
Turnin' up a corn row, scare crow, farm house gravel road
Comin' for a good girl, countin' down the sun set
Never been broke heart, racin' like a Corvette
Got a little wildfire burnin' in her angel eyes
Probably ain't never been lost after midnight
Tryin' to be a good girl, but fallin' for a bad boy
Tryin' to be a good girl, but fallin' for a bad boy

[Outro]
Yeah
She's so good, she's so good, she's so good
She's so good, she's so good, she's so good
She's so good, she's so good, she's so good
But fallin' for a bad boy

[Verse 1]
I wake up and get me
A gas station biscuit
Head to town, wash it down with some Mountain Dew
I end every day about the same way
Clock out and go fish just to crack a few
Chicken in a bread pan
Pickin' out gulls and cull with some ten pound tail
It might be hillbilly to a lot of folks
But Lord knows I couldn't care less

[Chorus]
You can say I'm a redneck
You can say you don't like my truck
You can say that I talk and I dress all funny
But you, you can't say I ain't country
You can say I drink too many longnecks
And my edges are a little too rough
You can call me a sinner 'cause I cuss on Sunday
But you, you can't say I ain't country

[Verse 2]
A pond water pool, a spinner on a spool
A styrofoam full of tobacco spit
I got a small town crew, we make our own rules
I do what I do 'cause my daddy did

[Chorus]
You can say I'm a redneck
You can say you don't like my truck
You can say that I talk and I dress all funny
But you, you can't say I ain't country
You can say I drink too many longnecks
And my edges are a little too rough
You can call me a sinner 'cause I cuss on Sunday
But you, you can't say I ain't country

[Bridge]
You can say that the world's flat
You can say we never made it to the moon
You can say we all come from a bunch of monkeys
But you, you can't say I ain't country, no

[Chorus]
You can say I'm a redneck
You can say you don't like my truck
You can say that I talk and I dress all funny
But you, you can't say I ain't country
You can say I drink too many longnecks
And my edges are a little too rough
You can call me a sinner 'cause I cuss on Sunday
But you, you can't say I ain't country
You can say what I'm smokin' on is kinda funky
But you, you can't say I ain't
You can't say I ain't country (No you can't)
Oh no, you can't say I ain't country
That's right

[Verse 1: Florida Georgia Line]
Every time I look in your eyes
It's like you take me back to the islands
You got me mile high cause you're my little pilot
I'm smiling, no sand in the hour glass
We can let the hours pass, baby, cause you're timeless
It's easy living right beside you
We got it, whatever we go through, baby

[Chorus 1: Florida Georgia Line]
Life is a honeymoon, we're gonna live it
Let love keep us lifting, my dear
Turn up a summer tune, we're gonna kick it
Get it sounding like Hendrix in here
Serve the cerveza cause we wanna sip it
Not missing a moment we're giving
Cause life is a honeymoon, we're gonna live it
Let love keep us lifting, my dear

[Verse 2: Florida Georgia Line]
See, it's a Monday through Friday, 365 celebration
A every day-cation
Let my kiss be an open invitation
See where it can take us and get our hearts racing
I love flying way up there with you
You keep the air up in my parachute, baby

[Chorus 2: Florida Georgia Line]
Life is a honeymoon, we're gonna live it
Let love keep us lifting, my dear
Turn up a summer tune, let's have a party
Get it sounding like Marley in here
Serve the cerveza cause we wanna sip it
Not missing a moment we're giving
Cause life is a honeymoon, we're gonna live it
Let love keep us lifting, my dear

[Verse 3: Ziggy Marley]
She is my morning sun and when the evening come
She's the moonlit sky, yeah
Truth is, this is how we belong
Happy people do it one and one, let your tear be gone
No need to worry, this love is forever young
The queen of my desire, you're my music from my song
The wood in on my fire, you're my fire that's never gone
Who feels it knows, FGL how it goes

[Chorus 1: Florida Georgia Line]
Life is a honeymoon, we're gonna live it
Let love keep us lifting, my dear
Turn up a summer tune, we're gonna kick it
Get it sounding like Hendrix in here
Serve the cerveza cause we wanna sip it
Not missing a moment we're giving
Cause life is a honeymoon, we're gonna live it

[Verse 1]
Girl, you melt me like ice in whiskey
With those blue flame looks that you give me
You can't hide what's inside
And it's killing me right now to see you wanna slip off with me again

[Chorus]
Why should we go 'round and 'round the truth, like we've been doin'?
Every time we lie, girl, we're losin'
So why should we spend Saturday night alone
When I can call you on the phone, pick you up
Make it up as we go along
Pull an all nighter, chasin' that desire
Sparks flyin' in her eyes like lighters (Like lighters)
Get a little higher (Get a little higher)
Sippin' on fire (Sippin' on fire)

[Verse 2]
You act like you don't know what you're missin'
Every time you end up back with him
'Cause it's safe, and you're scared
Of everything you're feelin' when we're burnin' the midnight down again

[Chorus]
Why should we go 'round and 'round the truth, like we've been doin'?
Every time we lie, girl, we're losin'
So why should we spend Saturday night alone
When I can call you on the phone, pick you up
Make it up as we go along
Pull an all nighter, chasin' that desire
Sparks flyin' in her eyes like lighters (Like lighters)
Get a little higher (Get a little higher)
Sippin' on fire (Sippin' on fire)

[Bridge]
Every goodbye is bittersweet
So why should we fight what we both need?

[Chorus]
And why should we go 'round and 'round the truth, like we've been doin'?
Every time we lie, girl, we're losin'
So why should we spend Saturday night alone
When I can call you on the phone, pick you up
Make it up as we go along
Pull an all nighter, chasin' that desire
Sparks flyin' in her eyes like lighters (Like lighters)
Get a little higher (Get a little higher)
Sippin' on fire (Sippin' on fire)

[Outro]
Girl, you melt me like ice in whiskey
With those blue flame looks that you give me
You can't hide what's inside
And it's killin' me right now to see you wanna slip off with me

[Verse 1]
You can trade that pickup for a brand new Cadillac
Slap you on that custom Gucci suit and ditch that camo hat
You can move from the boondocks to Beverly Hills
Drop a little hip-hop in the boombox, but still

[Chorus]
You can't hide red
Don’t you know you were born this way?
You can't hide red
You can see it in everything
Yeah, like the way we walk, the way we talk
It's the down home way we raised
Don’t ever wanna, ain't ever gonna change
Can't hide red
With that twang, we sang
You can't hide red
And we smoke, and we drank
You can't hide red

[Verse 2]
You might catch us holding doors
Saying grace and "Thank you Lord
For the good times and the good life we all live, Amen"
So what if we all backwards just because you talkin' faster?
Hell, you ain't got no tobacco in your lip

[Chorus]
You can't hide red
Don’t you know we were born this way?
You can’t hide red
You can see it in everything
Yeah, like the way we walk, the way we talk
It's the down home way we raised
Don’t ever wanna, ain't ever gonna change
You can't hide red
With that twang, we sang
You can't hide red
And we smoke, and we drank
You can’t hide red

[Bridge]
You can move from the boondocks to Beverly Hills
Drop a little hip-hop in the boombox, but still

[Chorus]
You can't hide red
Don't you know we were born this way?
You can't hide red
You can see it in everything
Yeah, like the way we walk, the way we talk
It's the down home way we raised (Down home way we raised)
Don't ever wanna, ain't ever gonna change
You can't hide red (Red)
With that twang (That twang), we sang (We sang)
You can't hide red
And we smoke (We smoke), and we drank (We drank)
You can't hide red

[Verse 1]
White collar, blue collar, hillbilly, high dollar
Hot head, pot head, non-believer, holy water
Big city, small town, y'all take a look around
People are different
Heavy metal, hip hop, steel toe, flip flops
Sip it slow, cold beer, hits you fast, whiskey shot
Accent North, South, good as gold, sailor mouth
People are different

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Yeah, we all know it's true
But it don't mean that me and you

[Chorus]
Can't walk down a street and smile at a stranger
Heart on your sleeve and love thy neighbor
No matter what shape, no matter what color
Break bread instead of fighting each other
Slip on a pair of another man's shoes
You'll see by the time you get back
This old world would be a whole lot better place
If we'd all just embrace the fact
That people are different
People are different

[Verse 2]
Left wing, right wing, jail house, freedom ring
Old school, new school, everything in-between
Like a snowflake, no fingerprint's the same
And people are different

[Pre-Chorus 2]
I wish that it was something that we all understood
Lord knows it'd do us all some good

[Chorus]
To walk down a street and smile at a stranger
Heart on your sleeve and love thy neighbor
No matter what shape, no matter what color
Break bread instead of fighting each other
Slip on a pair of another man's shoes
You'll see by the time you get back
This old world would be a whole lot better place
If we'd all just embrace the fact
That people are different
Yeah, people are different

[Bridge]
You can turn on the TV
Change the channel if you don't like what you see
You can get your money back if it ain't your size
You can throw it in the trash if you don't like it
But listen, people are different

[Chorus]
So walk down the street and smile at a stranger
Heart on your sleeve and love thy neighbor
No matter what shape, no matter what color
Break bread instead of fighting each other
Slip on a pair of another man's shoes
You'll see by the time you get back
This old world would be a whole lot better place
If we'd all just embrace the fact
That people are different
People are different
People are different
Whoa, yeah

[Chorus]
I still go riding around town
With the windows down and your feet up on my dash
Got your rays on and my hat’s back and we're feeling cool as cash
The night is on, like you ain't even gone
You go slidin' through the static trying to find that song you love
Smoke rolling up and you showin' up like a dime piece in the dust
You got me stoned, like you ain't even gone

[Verse 1]
Sunset, twilight, Friday night
Round back, chill a dollar fifty miller high life
Headband, peace sign, looking fly, shotgun bullet going straight through a street sign

[Pre-Chorus]
You had diamonds in your eyes when you were smiling
Even pretty when you're cryin'
If I said I wasn't missing you I'd be lyin'
But the truth is, girl the truth is

[Chorus]
I still go riding around town
With the windows down and your feet up on my dash
Got your rays on and my hats back and we're feeling cool as cash
The night is on (Another moonlight ride), like you ain't even gone
You go sliding through the static trying to find that song you love
Smoke rolling up and you showin’ up like a dime piece in the dust
You got me stoned (It still feels so right)
Like you ain't even gone (Like you ain't even gone)
Like you ain't even gone

[Verse 2]
Midnight calling me looking for trouble
Slipping them should have beens in my ear
Got me shooting down that girl's memory double
That blue eyes, summer smoke, sunburn red smile
Said you were leaving this town, got to runaway
I watched you drive away, and girl you should have chased down

[Pre-Chorus]
Those diamonds in your eyes when you were smiling
Even pretty when you're cryin'
If I said I wasn't missing you I'd be lyin'
'Cause the truth is, girl, the truth is

[Chorus]
I still go riding around town
With the windows down and your feet up on my dash
Got your rays on and my hat’s back and we're feeling cool as cash
The night is on (Another moonlight ride), like you ain't even gone
You go sliding through the static trying to find that song you love
Smoke rolling up and you showin’ up like a dime piece in the dust
You got me stoned (It still feels so right)
Like you ain't even gone (Like you ain't even gone, gonee)
You ain't even gone, gone, gone
You ain't even gone, gone, gone

[Outro]
Sunset, twilight, Friday night
Round back, chill a dollar fifty miller high life
Headband, peace sign, looking fly, shotgun bullet going straight through a street sign
Sunset, twilight, Friday night
Round back, chill a dollar fifty miller high life
Headband, peace sign, looking fly, shotgun bullet going straight through a street sign

[Verse 1]
Yeah this place is wall to wall, can't barely move, takes fifteen minutes just to get a drink
It's crazy here, this crowd tonight's so loud in here you can hardly think
But everything's fading babe, cause you're all I see
It's like we're alone in here baby

[Chorus]
We might as well be on an island, we might as well be on the moon
The way you're looking at me baby, can't take my eyes off you
Feels like the world is disappearing every time we touch
We're so caught up in each other, it's just the two of us
We might as well be on an island, we might as well be on an island

[Verse 2]
It's just me and you, back corner booth, we're sitting on the same seat
Got my hands all over you and, yeah girl, you're all over me
Like nobody's watching us baby, let them all see
Still that ain't stopping us baby

[Chorus]
We might as well be on an island, we might as well be on the moon
The way you're looking at me baby, can't take my eyes off you
Feels like the world is disappearing every time we touch
We're so caught up in each other, it's just the two of us
We might as well be on an island, we might as well be on an island

[Bridge]
We might as well be on an island
Like we're the last two on this Earth
Like we're frozen here in time
Like it's empty here tonight

[Chorus]
We might as well be on an island, we might as well be on the moon
The way you're looking at me baby, can't take my eyes off you
Feels like the world is disappearing every time we touch
We're so caught up in each other, it's just the two of us
We might as well be on an island, we might as well be on an island, yeah

[Verse 1]
Yeah, I grew up ten minutes from the sticks
Ten minutes from the beach
And there ain't a Bible verse, y'all
I ain't heard a preacher preach
Mom and Dad up in the bleachers
Screaming while I pitch
Beating deep on the speakers
Finally riding around the town
With my best friends, ain't life like a whirlwind
One second I'm playing checkers with Grandma
Then my world ends
I used to hear my granddaddy say
Before it's too late

[Chorus]
You gotta dig your roots
'For the sun goes down
Show some love back to your hometown
Fall in love, plant some seeds
Carve some names in the family tree
Raise your kids, love your wife
Put God first, just to live your life
Hey, I think I'm gonna go
And get a little more dirt on my boots
You gotta dig your roots
(You dig, you love, you gotta put 'em in the ground for someone)

[Verse 2]
Yeah, I'm a long haired, tattooed, feather in the wind
Yeah, a good ol' boy, just like my old man
Every night when I'm singing
I know he's looking down
Up there next to PawPaw
Got the best seats in the house
When I close my eyes I can still hear him say
The same thing I'm gonna tell my kids

[Chorus]
You gotta dig your roots
'For the sun goes down
Show some love back to your hometown
Fall in love, plant some seeds
Carve some names in the family tree
Raise your kids, love your wife
Put God first, just to live your life
Hey, I think I'm gonna go
And get a little more dirt on my boots
You gotta dig your roots

[Bridge]
I'm so of proud of where I came from (It's every part of me)
This town is who I am (My name's on every street)
And the way I was raised up (Yeah, you best believe)
Made me a better man (Just like my daddy)
I'm proud of where I came from (It's every part of me)
And damn I love this land (My name's on every street)
And the way that I was raised up (Yeah, you best believe)
Made me a better man

[Chorus]
You gotta dig your roots
'For the sun goes down
Show some love back to your hometown
Fall in love, plant some seeds
Carve some names in the family tree
Raise your kids, love your wife
Put God first, just to live your life
Hey, I think I'm gonna go
And get a little more dirt on my boots
Yeah, I think I'm gonna go
And get a little more dirt on my boots
You gotta dig your roots

[Outro]
You dig, you love, you gotta put 'em in the ground for someone
You dig, you love, you gotta put 'em in the ground for someone

[Intro]
I'ma lifer

[Verse 1]
I can hear that rain fallin' on this tin roof
Girl after all we've been through
Feels like the calm after the storm
So what you say we take this sunday
Let me love you till it's monday
We'll go have a fun day and baby we'll get back to us
We'll get back to us
We've been trippin' over the same shit
I'm over the who's to blame shit
We throwin' up a white flag
I'm dancin' with who I came with
I'm your man and you my lady

[Chorus]
Baby I'm a lifer I ain't goin' nowhere
Told you since day one I had to wife ya
Show the world that I just wanna love ya
Girl I don't wanna fight ya
Yeah you're the only one for me
God knows that I'm a product of George Strait
And dammit I love singing to you
I done check yes and gave my mama's ring to you
Ain't nobody was sighted
My arms can't get any wider
Baby I'ma, baby I'ma, baby I'ma lifer
I'ma lifer, I'ma lifer, I'ma lifer

[Verse 2]
Whatever we go through girl we're family
There's nothin' we can't do can we
Tether through the weather, got us better than before
We just gotta learn how to stay here
Build on the love we made here
Make more time for prayer and the man upstairs
Cause I believe we can move any mountain when we're good
I believe I ain't me without you walkin' out in that white dress
Life without you is lifeless
And I'm your man and you my lady

[Chorus]
Baby I'm a lifer I ain't goin' nowhere
Told you since day one I had to wife ya
Show the world that I just wanna love ya
Girl I don't wanna fight ya
Yeah you're the only one for me
God knows that I'm a product of George Strait
And dammit I love singing to you
I done check yes and gave my mama's ring to you
Ain't nobody was sighted
My arms can't get any wider
Baby I'ma, baby I'ma, baby I'ma lifer


[Verse 3]
The twists and turns
Sometimes the love can hurt ya
Sometimes it burns
The wait ain't always perfect
We'll just keep diggin'
Dig our feet into the dirt and we'll get back to us
We'll get back to us
We've been trippin' over the same shit
I'm over the who's to blame shit
We throwin' up a white flag
I'm dancin' with who I came with
Can't wait to see our kids
Hope they look just like you

[Chorus]
Baby I'm a lifer I ain't goin' nowhere
Told you since day one I had to wife ya
Show the world that I just wanna love ya
Girl I don't wanna fight ya
Yeah you're the only one for me
God knows that I'm a product of George Strait
And dammit I love singing to you
I done check yes and gave my mama's ring to you
Ain't nobody was sighted
My arms can't get any wider
Baby I'ma, baby I'ma, baby I'ma lifer
I'ma lifer, I'ma lifer, I'ma lifer, I'ma lifer

[Outro]
There's somethin' about them raindrops, them raindrops
Just let 'em fall
Till the pain stops, till the pain stops, let 'em fall
Just let 'em fall
There's somethin' about them raindrops, them raindrops
Just let 'em fall
Till the pain stops, till the pain stops, let 'em fall
Just let 'em fall

[Verse 1: Florida Georgia Line]
Well there's those boys, got the kind of ride
Get fifty-five to the gallon
They listen to that new school
Never heard of George or Alan
There's those boys, wear the kind of boots
Who you ain't supposed to get muddy
Ain't got a dog that lives outside
Ain't got a buddy named Buddy

[Pre-Chorus: Florida Georgia Line]
Yeah, I ain't hatin' on them boys
Grew up lockin' their doors
There's all kinds of boys up under the sun, son
But this one's for

[Chorus: Florida Georgia Line]
Y'all boys with that southern drawl boys
Hell before you naw, rollin' off just right
Man, that town is small boys
But you'd have a ball boys
Homemade alcohol on a Saturday night
Yeah, truck stuck, who you gon' call?
Pretty girl, who you gon' fall for?
One of them backroad runners
Man, I'm glad I'm one of y'all boys
(Yo Hardy, go on tell 'em 'bout the girls one time)

[Verse 2: HARDY]
'Cause there's those girls, they're like golden pearls
Dipping into trust fund money (Cha-ching!)
Yeah, the radio and the Jack and Coke
Is the only thing they know country
Didn't grow up on no county road
They grew up on some street
And they think they know what kind of man
They want until they meet

[Chorus: HARDY]
Y'all boys with that southern drawl boys
Hell before you naw, rollin' off just right
Man, that town is small boys
But you'd have a ball boys
Homemade alcohol on a Saturday night
Yeah, truck stuck, who you gon' call?
Pretty girl, who you gon' fall for?
One of them backroad runners
Man, I'm glad I'm one of y'all boys

[Bridge: HARDY]
State trophy in the hall boys
Hangin' somethin' that you hunted on the wall boys
You mess with one of us, you get us all boys

[Chorus: Florida Georgia Line & HARDY]
Y'all boys with that southern drawl boys
Hell before you naw, rollin' off just right
Man, that town is small boys
But you'd have a ball boys
Homemade alcohol on a Saturday night
Yeah, truck stuck, who you gon' call?
Pretty girl, who you gon' fall for?
One of them backroad runners
Man, I'm glad I'm one of y'all boys

[Verse 1]
Tears on a six string
Another angel gone
Leavin' you all alone
Dealin' with your demons
I know you layin' there wonderin'
If your prayers ever make it through the ceilin' too
Yeah, I know what you're goin' through

[Chorus]
If I could write the perfect song
Make a little right out of all the wrongs
Would you close your eyes?
Would you let it in?
Would you light your candle against the wind?
If I could sing the perfect words
And change the world, unhurt the hurt
That we're all feelin'
Stop the bleedin'
Get back to believin'
Love is the answer and music is healin'

[Verse 2]
And there's a lot of souls lookin' for the high road
Everybody's needin'
Maybe just a little simple melody
Is all we need to keep our boomin' hearts beatin' true
And get the whole world in tune

[Chorus]
If I could write the perfect song
Make a little right out of all the wrongs
Would you close your eyes?
Would you let it in?
Would you light your candle against the wind?
If I could sing the perfect words
And change the world, unhurt the hurt
That we're all feelin'
Stop the bleedin'
Get back to believin'
Love is the answer and music is healin'

[Verse 3]
Yeah I know in my heart of hearts
That we're where we're supposed to be
And everybody's got the scars
But we can live in harmony, yeah
(Your song is playin', it's gonna save us)
When you're layin' there wonderin'
If your prayers ever make it through the ceilin' too
Yeah, I know what you're goin' through

[Chorus]
If I could write the perfect song
Make a little right out of all the wrongs
Would you close your eyes?
Would you let it in?
Would you light your candle against the wind?
If I could sing the perfect words
And change the world, unhurt the hurt
That we're all feelin'
Stop the bleedin'
Get back to believin'
Love is the answer and music is healin'
Love is the answer and music is healin'
You gotta believe it
Love is the answer and music is healin'

[Verse 1]
In your cup holder was some loose change
Ya got your cellphone on vibrate
I wish you were on it
There's a road you got to take to get to my place
Faded double yellow lines on a two lane
I wish you were on it

[Chorus]
I could use a little you right now
Rushin' over, runnin' into my house
With want you back tears rollin' down your face
Drop your keys on my hardwood floor
Kiss me like you never kissed me before
And girl I swear that's all that it would take
And you know the way
I wish you were on it
(Wish you were on it, wish you were on it)

[Verse 2]
There's a parking spot under the sycamore
And the flood light on the front porch
I wish you were on it
And through the front door, up the stair case
There's a four post down the hall way
I wish you were on it

[Chorus]
I could use a little you right now
Rushin' over, runnin' into my house
With want you back tears rollin' down your face
Drop your keys on my hardwood floor
Kiss me like you never kissed me before
And girl I swear that's all that it would take
And you know the way
I wish you were on it
(Wish you were on it, wish you were on it)

[Bridge]
There's a heart that needs to unbreak
And you know the way

[Chorus]
I could use a little you right now
Rushin' over, runnin' into my house
With want you back tears rollin' down your face
Drop your keys on my hardwood floor
Kiss me like you never kissed me before
And girl I swear that's all that it would take
And you know the way
I wish you were on it
(Wish you were on it, wish you were on it)

[Intro]
Don't act like y'all didn't know this wasn't comin'
Alright

[Verse 1]
You know Tommy gonna trick his truck, jack it up big time
Lift kit, chrome tips, spit shinin' like a diamond
Game change when the rain came and we took it down a back road
Georgia clay mud hole, that's how these boys roll
Now it's late night underneath the moonlight
Everybody's feelin' right and sippin' on a Bud Light
Go on, drop your tailgate, turn up your radio
I'ma build a bonfire, you can make yourself at home

[Interlude]
Kick back, relax, you know we just a bunch of hillbillies
Tip back your cup of Jack and throw your hands up with me

[Chorus]
Hey, we might look a little crazy tonight
But hey baby, that's alright
It's our backwoods boondock roots
(It's just what we do, it's just what we do)
Hey, ain't no way to make this up
When it's runnin' through your blood
There ain't no hidin' the truth
(It's just what we do, it's just what we do)
Yeah, it's just a what we do

[Verse 2]
You see, Tommy called Jenny and Jenny gon' call the hotties
Tell 'em 'bout the party, so don't forget the Bacardi
Time to get your buzz on, and your love on all night long
And if you play your hand right, you won't have to go home alone
Six-string pickin', solo cup sippin'
And when the moments right, grab your phone and get them digits
Crankin' that Bocephus, we all good with Jesus
Come Sunday mornin', that preacher, he 'bout to preach it
Kick back, relax, and pass the good time moonshine
Who brought the party? Damn, that was Florida Georgia Line

[Chorus]
Hey, we might look a little crazy tonight
But hey baby, that's alright
It's our backwoods boondock roots
(It's just what we do, it's just what we do)
Hey, ain't no way to make this up
When it's runnin' through your blood
There ain't no hidin' the truth
(It's just what we do, it's just what we do)
Yeah, it's just a what we do

[Guitar Solo]

[Chorus]
Hey (Come on, baby), we might look a little crazy tonight
But hey baby, that's alright
It's our backwoods boondocks roots
(It's just what we do, it's just what we do)
Hey, ain't no way to make this up
When it's runnin' through your blood
There ain't no hidin' the truth
(It's just what we do)
Hey, what you say we get crazy tonight? (Crazy tonight)
Go get your drinks up high
It's our backwoods boondocks roots
(It's just what we do, it's just what we do)
Hey, ain't no way to make this up (Make this up)
When it's runnin' through your blood
There ain't no hidin' the truth
(It's just what we do, it's just what we do)
Yeah, it's just what we do
Yeah, it's just what we do
Yeah, it's just what we do

[Verse 1]
Let’s turn it up loud, mix it up strong
Lean it back slow, get your feel good on
Cut 'em off short, roll it up tight
Let it unwind tonight
Drop down the top down on the Pontiac
Wherever you wind up is where the party’s at
Break out the bottle of Bacardi Black
And don’t look back ’cause

[Chorus]
Here's to the good times, here’s to the sunshine
Here's to the ice you float your beer in
To the tops that pop and the tan lines disappearin'
Oh my, my
She’s a little bit tipsy
Leans in for a kiss, she's stealin' your heart just like a gypsy
And there you are, just a drunken star, just fallin' in her eyes
Here’s to the good times
While there’s still time

[Verse 3]
We'll lay it all out, spray it on sweet
Carve it in oak and permanent ink
Park it way back, fog it on up
Singin' whoa, whoa
Radio spillin' from a single cab
She looks so good with her silver tabs
Hangin' on a branch by the river
That's a memory that'll get you when you look back

[Chorus]
Here's to the good times, here’s to the sunshine
Here's to the ice you float your beer in
To the tops that pop and the tan lines disappearin'
Oh my, my
She’s a little bit tipsy
Leans in for a kiss, she's stealin' your heart just like a gypsy
And there you are, just a drunken star, just fallin' in her eyes
Here’s to the good times
While there’s still time

[Bridge]
Drop down the top down on the Pontiac
Wherever you wind up is where the party’s at
Break out the bottle of Bacardi Black
And don’t look back ’cause

[Chorus]
Here's to the good times, here's to the sunshine
Here's to the ice you float your beer in
To the tops that pop and the tan lines disappearin'
Oh my, my
She’s a little bit tipsy
Leans in for a kiss, she's stealin' your heart just like a gypsy
And there you are, just a drunken star, just fallin' in her eyes
Here’s to the good times

[Outro]
Here's to the good times and the moonshine
And them blue eyes under the moonlight
Here's to the good times
Here's to the good times, buzzin' on moonshine
Lovin' you all night under the moonlight
Here's to the good times
While there’s still time

[Verse 1]
I, I been waitin' all day for the sun to go down
Get away from the noise and the crowd
Girl, I been dying to get my hands on you
Run my fingers down your back
If that's where you like it at
Get it started just like that

[Chorus]
I'll love you like you never had it
I'll get you makin' this a habit
I'll have you calling your friends, saying you ain't ever been
Skin on skin with a man like this
I love you like you never had it
(Keep on comin' back, girl)
I love you like you never had it
(Best you ever had, girl)
I love you like you never had it
(Keep on comin' back, girl)
I love you like you never had it
(Best you ever had, girl)

[Verse 2]
You, you been wondering where I've been your whole life
Need somebody that'll fit just right
Treat your body, blow your mind

[Chorus]
I'll love you like you never had it
I'll get you makin' this a habit
I'll have you calling your friends, saying you ain't ever been
Skin on skin with a man like this
I love you like you never had it
(Keep on comin' back, girl)
I love you like you never had it
(Best you ever had, girl)
I love you like you never had it
(Keep on comin' back, girl)
I love you like you never had it
(Best you ever had, girl)

[Bridge]
Lock that door, close those curtains tight
We're going on and on, and on and on all night

[Chorus]
I'll love you like you never had it
I'll get you makin' this a habit
I'll have you calling your friends, saying you ain't ever been
Skin on skin with a man like this
I love you like you never had it
(Keep on comin' back, girl)
I love you like you never had it
(Best you ever had, girl)
I love you like you never had it
(Keep on comin' back, girl)
I love you like you never had it
(Best you ever had, girl)

[Verse 1]
Layin' back against this windshield
Parked out in this Georgia red field
This is where we burn our summer nights
Moonlit lipstick kisses on the hood of that Tacoma
We were seventeen, goin' on free and wild

[Pre-Chorus]
She was smoking hot, a whiskey shot, a cherry coke
Sparks were flying every time I smelled smoke

[Chorus]
I'm sittin' by a bonfire watchin' her swayin'
Me and my buddies and the guitar playin'
Sipping on forties on a Saturday night
Buzzing through a chorus of 'Dixieland Delight'
High as the stars in the Milky Way
Those summer days drifted away
But she'll always float
Back through my mind like smoke

[Verse 2]
July flames, October ashes
Southern skin and blue jean flashes
Strike a match and light a memory
We never said goodbye, we let it fly into thin air
Tonight I'm stoned on long-gone love so strong, I swear

[Chorus]
I'm sittin' by a bonfire watchin' her swayin'
Me and my buddies and the guitar playin'
Sipping on forties on a Saturday night
Buzzing through a chorus of 'Dixieland Delight'
High as the stars in the Milky Way
Those summer days drifted away
But she'll always float
Back through my mind like smoke

[Pre-Chorus]
She was smoking hot, a whiskey shot, a cherry coke
Sparks were flying every time I smelled smoke

[Chorus]
I'm sittin' by a bonfire watchin' her swayin'
Me and my buddies and the guitar playin'
Sipping on forties on a Saturday night
Buzzing through a chorus of 'Dixieland Delight'
High as the stars in the Milky Way
Those summer days drifted away
But she'll always float
Back through my mind like smoke

[Outro]
Moonlit lipstick kisses on the hood of that Tacoma
We were seventeen, goin' on free and wild

[Verse 1]
If you leave your doors unlocked
If your garage is your body shop
If your dog's got room to run
You might be from a small town
And if you've ever kissed a girl
Spinnin' 'round on a tilt-a-whirl
At the county fair in the summer sun
You might be from a small town

[Chorus]
I bet you been sittin' on a John Deere tractor
Bet you been fishin' with an old cane pole
Been cow-tippin' in a big green pasture
Burned up a clutch on a red dirt road
Homegrown twist, a pinch of tobacco
Shiner Friday night, the sun settin' real slow
In the parking lot with the party crowd
Little bit of love in the truck way out
If you're pickin' up what I'm puttin' down
You might be from a small town
You might be from a small town

[Verse 2]
If you got a spot or two
Where you kick it with your high school crew
Or you drive 30 miles for a fifth of rum
You might be from a small town, yeah

[Chorus]
I bet you been sittin' on a John Deere tractor
Bet you been fishin' with an old cane pole
Been cow-tippin' in a big green pasture
Burned up a clutch on a red dirt road
Homegrown twist, a pinch of tobacco
Shiner Friday night, the sun settin' real slow
In the parking lot with the party crowd
Little bit of love in the truck way out
If you're pickin' up what I'm puttin' down
You might be from a small town
You might be from a small town

[Bridge]
Yeah, put the fence in the dirt, no rent paid (No rent)
What you know about church on a Wednesday? (Uh)
What you know about workin' the ten day straight
On a turn road, tryna get the bills paid?
Ever raced your truck? Ever wrecked one?
Said grace in a Mexican restaurant? (Amen)
Painted "I love you" in bright red
On a water tower, I bet

[Chorus]
I bet you been sittin' on a John Deere tractor
Bet you been fishin' with an old cane pole
Been cow-tippin' in a big green pasture
Burned up a clutch on a red dirt road
Homegrown twist, a pinch of tobacco
Shiner Friday night, the sun settin' real slow
In the parking lot with the party crowd
Little bit of love in the truck way out
If you're pickin' up what I'm puttin' down
You might be from a small town
You might be from a small town
You might be from a small town
You might be from a small town
You might be from a small town

[Outro]
You might be from a small town

[Verse 1]
It ain't the proof or the alcohol, nah
It's got my back up against the wall
Staring at you, you, you
Watching you move, move, move, yeah

[Pre-Chorus 1]
And I can't even walk across the room without losing my cool
You got my world tippin' and spinnin' doin' what you do
Yeah, you're making me swerve

[Chorus]
Hey girl, what's your name?
You must get it from your mama
Does your daddy let you date with all them curves? Hold on
Yeah, where you learn to dance?
Yeah, I'ma two-step up to you with that booty in them pants
Way you rollin' in that body, feel like I'm in a Bugatti
And I know I'm 'bout to lose control

[Post-Chorus]
You're making me swerve
(Making me, making me swerve
Making me swerve
Making me, making me swerve)
You're making me swerve
(Making me swerve
Making me, making me swerve
Making me swerve
Making me, making me swerve)

[Verse 2]
Yeah, I just really came to chill tonight, but
You got me silly, girl, you got me high
'Cause you so fine, fine, fine
I'm losing my mind, mind, mind, yeah

[Pre-Chorus 2]
And I can't even walk across the room without losing my cool
And girl you change the game, you got me changing lanes to hang with you
Yeah, you're making me swerve

[Chorus]
Hey girl, what's your name?
You must get it from your mama
Does your daddy let you date with all them curves? Hold on
Yeah, where you learn to dance?
Yeah, I'ma two-step up to you with that booty in them pants
Way you rollin' in that body, feel like I'm in a Bugatti
And I know I'm 'bout to lose control

[Post-Chorus]
You're making me swerve
(Making me, making me swerve
Making me swerve
Making me, making me swerve)
You're making me swerve
(Making me swerve
Making me, making me swerve
Making me swerve
Making me, making me)

[Bridge]
And I ain't ever been down this road before
And I ain't ever met nobody like yours
You're making me swerve
You're making me swerve
You're making me swerve
You're making me swerve, swerve
Let's go

[Guitar solo]

[Outro]
Way you rollin' in that body, feel like I'm in a Bugatti
And I know I'm 'bout to lose control
You're making me swerve
(Making me, making me swerve
Making me swerve
Making me, making me swerve)
You're making me swerve
(Making me swerve
Making me, making me swerve
Making me swerve
Making me, making me swerve)

[Verse 1]
Well, Daisy Duke, peek-a-boo
I might've learned a thing or two
On a Friday night joyride
Out there on the county line
Drag racin' 'til the blue lights chase us
And we scattered like sparks from a Black Cat fuse
Train bridge where we spray paint Skynard
And the gold flakes glimmered in the cinnamon booze

[Chorus]
We were livin' every minute of the night
Like there might never be another
We were runnin' all the caution lights
We were learnin' to fly with a little tail gunner
If there was somethin' to burn, we were burnin' it
Anything with a curve, we were turnin' it
Just wildfires out there under
The hell raisin' heat of the summer

[Verse 2]
Alabama on the Alpine
Bust a cap on a deer sign
A little back seat butterfly
Homegrown angel that'll get you high
That'll get you high

[Chorus]
We were livin' every minute of the night
Like there might never be another
We were runnin' all the caution lights
We were learnin' to fly with a little tail gunner
If there was somethin' to burn, we were burnin' it
Anything with a curve, we were turnin' it
Just wildfires out there under
The hell raisin' heat of the summer

[Bridge]
Yeah, I see it clearer in the rear view mirror
Than I ever did lookin' out over the hood
Yeah man, we had some damn good times
And I sure hope everybody's doin' good

[Chorus]
We were livin' every minute of the night
Like there might never be another
We were runnin' all the caution lights
We were learnin' to fly with a little tail gunner
If there was somethin' to burn, we were burnin' it
Anything with a curve, we were turnin' it
Just wildfires out there under
The hell raisin' heat of the summer

[Outro]
The hell raisin' heat of the summer
The hell raisin' heat of the summer

[Verse 1]
Used to spend my nights out in a barroom
Liquor was the only love I'd known
But you rescued me from reachin' for the bottom
And brought me back from bein' too far gone

[Chorus]
You're as smooth as Tennessee whiskey
You're as sweet as strawberry wine
You're as warm as a glass of brandy
And honey, I stay stoned on your love all the time

[Verse 2]
I've looked for love in all the same old places
Found the bottom of a bottle's always dry
But when you poured out your heart, I didn't waste it
'Cause there's nothin' like your love to get me high

[Chorus]
And you're as smooth as Tennessee whiskey
You're as sweet as strawberry wine
You're as warm as a glass of brandy
And honey, I stay stoned on your love all the time

[Guitar Solo]

[Chorus]
You're as smooth as Tennessee whiskey
You're as sweet as strawberry wine
You're as warm as a glass of brandy
And honey, I stay stoned on your love all the time

[Outro]
You're as smooth as Tennessee whiskey
Tennessee whiskey, Tennessee whiskey
You're as smooth as Tennessee whiskey
Tennessee whiskey, Tennessee whiskey

[Verse 1]
We pass in the hall
On our way to separate rooms
The only time we ever talk
Is when the monthly bills are due

[Pre-Chorus 1]
We go to work, we go to church
We fake the perfect life
I'm past the point of give a damn
And all my tears are cried

[Chorus]
We can just go on like this
Say the word, we'll call it quits
Baby, you can go or you can stay
But I won't love you either way

[Verse 2]
It's been so long since I've felt
Anything inside these walls
You can't hate and you can't hurt
When you don't feel at all

[Pre-Chorus 2]
I used to cry and stay up nights
And wonder what went wrong
And it's been hard
But hearts can only do that for so long

[Chorus]
We can just go on like this
Say the word, we'll call it quits
Baby, you can go or you can stay
I won't love you either way

[Outro]
We can just go on like this
Say the word, we'll call it quits
Baby, you can go or you can stay
But I won't love you either way

[Verse 1]
Honey, load up your questions
And pick up your sticks and your stones
And pretend I'm a shelter
For heartaches that don't have a home

[Pre-Chorus 1]
And choose the words that cut like a razor
And all that I'll say, is...

[Chorus]
Fire away
Take your best shot
Show me what you got
Honey, I'm not afraid
Rear back and take aim
And fire away

[Verse 2]
Well, I wish I could say
That I've never been here before
But you know and I know
That I'll always come back for more

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Your love might be my damnation
But I'll cry to my grave

[Chorus]
Fire away
Take your best shot
Show me what you got
Honey, I'm not afraid
Rear back and take aim
And fire away

[Outro]
Aww, fire away
Take your best shot
Show me what you got
Honey, I'm not afraid
Rear back and take aim
And fire away
Fire away
Aww, fire away
Fire away

[Refrain]
Seen my share of broken halos
Folded wings that used to fly
They've all gone wherever they go
Broken halos that used to shine

[Verse 1]
Angels come down from the heavens
Just to help us on our way
Come to teach us, then they leave us
And they find some other soul to save

[Refrain]
Seen my share of broken halos
Folded wings that used to fly
They've all gone wherever they go
Broken halos that used to shine
Broken halos that used to shine

[Verse 2]
Don't go looking for the reasons
Don't go asking Jesus why
We're not meant to know the answers
They belong to the by and by
They belong to the by and by

[Refrain]
Seen my share of broken halos
Folded wings that used to fly
They've all gone wherever they go
Broken halos that used to shine
Broken halos that used to shine
Broken halos that used to shine
Broken halos that used to shine

[Verse 1]
Street lights along the highway
Throwin' shadows in the dark
And the memories keep on turnin'
To the rhythm of a broken heart

[Chorus]
You only need a roof when it's rainin'
You only need a fire when it's cold
You only need a drink when the whiskey
Is the only thing you have left to hold
Sun comes up and goes back down
And fallin' feels like flyin' 'til you hit the ground
Say the word and I'll be there for you
Baby, I will be your parachute

Parachute

[Verse 2]
There's a song that I remember
I never learned to play
And a lifetime of forgotten words
I never got to say

[Chorus]
You only need a roof when it's rainin'
You only need a fire when it’s cold
You only need a drink when the whiskey
Is the only thing you have left to hold
Sun comes up and goes back down
And fallin' feels like flyin' 'til you hit the ground
Say the word and I’ll be there for you
Baby, I will be your parachute

Parachute

[Bridge]
If you think you're goin' down
Just know I will be around

[Chorus]
You only need a roof when it's rainin'
You only need a fire when it's cold
You only need a drink when the whiskey
Is the only thing you have left to hold
Sun comes up and goes back down
And fallin' feels like flyin' 'til you hit the ground
Say the word and I'll be there for you
Baby, I will be your
Baby, I will be your parachute

Parachute

[Verse 1: Chris Stapleton]
When I think of you and the first time we met
And I heard the sound of your sweet gentle voice
My heart took me over and gave me no choice
And right then I knew

[Chorus: Chris Stapleton & Morgane Stapleton]
It makes me want more of you
Again and again
I fall more in love with you
Than I've ever been
From the moment you wake me up
'Til you kiss me goodnight
Everything that you do
It makes me want more of you

[Verse 2: Chris Stapleton with Morgane Stapleton]
When I look at you now that years have gone by
I think of the memories that time can't erase
And all of the smiles that you've brought to my face
Your love's been so true

[Chorus: Chris Stapleton & Morgane Stapleton]
It makes me want more of you
Again and again
I fall more in love with you
Than I've ever been
From the moment you wake me up
'Til you kiss me goodnight
Everything that you do
It makes me want more of you

[Verse 3: Chris Stapleton & Morgane Stapleton]
When I leave this earth you'll be holding my hand
And it gives me comfort to know you'll be there
And I'll thank the Lord for the love that we share
You're heaven to me

[Chorus: Chris Stapleton & Morgane Stapleton]
It makes me want more of you
Again and again
I fall more in love with you
Than I've ever been
From the moment you wake me up
'Til you kiss me goodnight
Everything that you do
It makes me want more of you

[Outro: Chris Stapleton with Morgane Stapleton]
Everything that you do
It makes me want more of you

[Verse 1]
There's a bottle on the dresser by your ring
And it's empty so right now I don't feel a thing
And I'll be hurtin' when I wake up on the floor
But I'll be over it by noon
That's the difference between whiskey and you

[Verse 2]
Come tomorrow, I can walk in any store
It ain't a problem, they'll always sell me more
But your forgiveness
Well, that's somethin' I can't buy
There ain't a thing that I can do
That's the difference between whiskey and you

[Chorus]
One's a devil, one keeps drivin' me insane
At times I wonder if they ain't both the same
But one's a liar that helps to hide me from my pain
And one's the long gone bitter truth
That's the difference between whiskey and you

[Verse 3]
I've got a problem but it ain't like what you think
I drink because I'm lonesome and I'm lonesome 'cause I drink
But if I don't break down and bring it on myself
It'll hit out of the blue
That's the difference between whiskey and you

[Chorus]
One's a devil, one keeps drivin' me insane
At times I wonder, oh, if they ain't both the same
One's a liar that helps to hide me from my pain
And one's the long gone bitter truth
That's the difference between whiskey and you

[Outro]
Aww, that's the difference between whiskey and you

[Verse 1]
She took down the photograph
Of our wedding day
Ripped it down the middle
And threw my half away
And I got nobody to blame but me
I got nobody to blame but me

[Verse 2]
She broke all my fishing rods
Put my guns in hock
Threw my clothes out in the yard
And changed out all the locks
And I got nobody to blame but me
I got nobody to blame but me

[Chorus]
I know right where I went wrong
I know just what got her gone
Turned my life into this country song
And I got nobody to blame but me
I got nobody to blame but me

[Verse 3]
She fired up my old hot rod
Ran it in the pond
Put sugar in my John Deere
I can't even mow my lawn
And I got nobody to blame but me
I got nobody to blame but me

[Verse 4]
She built her a bonfire
With my old six string
Took all my good whiskey
And poured it down the drain
And I got nobody to blame but me
I got nobody to blame but me

[Chorus]
I know right where I went wrong
I know just what got her gone
Turned my life into this country song
And I got nobody to blame but me
I got nobody to blame but me

[Verse 1]
I see the sunrise creepin' in
Everything changes like the desert wind
Here she comes and then she's gone again, and

[Chorus]
I'm just a traveller on this earth
Sure as my heart's behind the pocket of my shirt
I'll just keep rollin' 'til I'm in the dirt
'Cause I'm a traveller, oh, I'm a traveller
I couldn't tell you, honey, I don't know
Where I'm goin', but I've got to go
'Cause every turn reveals some other road
And I'm a traveller, oh, I'm a traveller

[Verse 2]
My heartbeat's rhythm is a lonesome sound
Just like the rubber turnin' on the ground
Always lost and nowhere bound

[Chorus]
I'm just a traveller on this earth
Sure as my heart's behind the pocket of my shirt
I'll just keep rollin' 'til I'm in the dirt
'Cause I'm a traveller, oh, I'm a traveller
I couldn't tell you, honey, I don't know
Where I'm goin', but I've got to go
'Cause every turn reveals some other road
And I'm a traveller, oh, I'm a traveller

[Bridge]
When I'm gone
Somebody else will have to feel this wrong
Somebody else will have to sing this song
Somebody else will have to sing along
Sing along

[Chorus]
I'm just a traveller on this earth
Sure as my heart's behind the pocket of my shirt
I'll just keep rollin' 'til I'm in the dirt
'Cause I'm a traveller, oh, I'm a traveller
I couldn't tell you, honey, I don't know
Where I'm goin', but I've got to go
'Cause every turn reveals some other road
And I'm a traveller, oh, I'm a traveller

I know it ain't
All that late
But you should probably leave

And I recognize
That look in your eyes
Yeah, you should probably leave

Cause I know you
And you know me
And we both know
Where this is gonna lead
And you want me to say
That I want you to stay
So you should probably leave
Yeah you should probably leave

There's still time
For you to finish your wine
Then you should probably leave

And it's hard to resist
All right, just one kiss
Then you should probably leave

Cause I know you
And you know me
And we both know
Where this is gonna lead
And you want me to say
That I want you to stay
So you should probably leave
Yeah you should probably leave

Like a devil on a shoulder
You keep whisperin' in my ear
And it's getting kinda hard for me
To do the right thing, yeah
I wanna do the right thing baby

Sun on your skin
It's six am
And I've been watching you sleep

Honey, I'm so afraid
You're gonna wake up and say
That you should probably leave

Cause I know you
And you know me
And we both know
Where this is gonna lead
I want you to stay
But you'll probably say
That you should probably leave
Yeah you should probably leave
Aw you should probably leave

[Chorus 1]
They say "Love is more precious than gold"
Can't be bought and it can't be sold
I got love, enough to spare
That makes me a millionaire

[Verse 1]
I got a woman with eyes that shine
Down deep, as a diamond mine
She's my treasure, so very rare
She made me a millionaire

[Verse 2]
When we ride around, ride around this old town
In my beat-up car, with the windows down
People look at her and they look at me
And say "That boy is sure livin' in luxury"
Sweet luxury

[Chorus 2]
'Cause love is more precious than gold
It can't be bought no, never could be sold
I got love, enough to share
That makes me a millionaire

[Interlude]

[Bridge]
When the kisses fall from everywhere
Like riches on a millionaire
When my pockets are empty and the cupboard is bare
I still feel like a millionaire

[Chorus 2]
'Cause love is more precious than gold
It can't be bought and it can't be sold
I got love, enough to spare
That makes me a millionaire

[Verse 1]
I was lookin' for a change of scene
You were lookin' at a magazine
It was red carpets and limousines
And the grass seemed so much greener
All we wanted was to get there fast
So we packed up everything we had
Runnin' on hope and a tank of gas
Like dreams ain't just for dreamers

[Pre-Chorus]
We couldn't wait to leave that life behind
And try to find salvation in that city limit sign

[Chorus]
And one of those L.A. nights
When the stars come out
Oh, the stars come out
And shine
And they burn so bright
They drown the downtown lights
When the stars come out
Oh, when the stars come out

[Verse 2]
Everybody's somebody, someday
Everybody's got a part to play
Everybody's tryin' to find a way
To say what needs sayin'
Everybody's got a friend of a friend
Somebody that can get you in
Beggin' angels for a sin
In a game that we're all playin'

[Pre-Chorus]
You and I, we're gamblers holdin' cards that we can't see
And I'm bettin' on you, and you're bettin' on me

[Chorus]
One of those L.A. nights
When the stars come out
Oh, the stars come out
And shine
And they burn so bright
They drown the downtown lights
When the stars come out
Oh, when the stars come out

[Bridge]
Down on the freeway, the sun is out of sight
And I got a feelin' tonight might be the night
Yeah, tonight might be the night

[Chorus]
One of those L.A. nights
When the stars come out
Oh, the stars come out
And shine
And they burn so bright
They drown the downtown lights
When the stars come out
Oh, when the stars come out

[Outro]
When the stars come out, ohh
When the stars come out

[Verse 1]
Well he came from Northern Ireland
Searching for the free man's ground
And he came to bet his fortune
On a West Virginia plow
He built a house of timber
And raised a redhead son
Then they worked the land together
And prayed the rain would come

[Chorus]
There's a scarecrow in the garden
That looks like Lucifer
And I've been reading Revelations
With my bare feet in the dirt

[Verse 2]
Well the redhead's son got older
And took a brown eyed wife
And the fields were green as dollars
Cause the dirt was black as night
I came in late September
The youngest one of three
And my sisters off and married
So the land was left to me

[Chorus]
There's a scarecrow in the garden
That looks like Lucifer
And I've been reading Revelations
With my bare feet in the dirt

[Bridge]
I know every single fencepost
Every rock that goes around
I've been staring at the red oak
Where I know they'll lay me down

[Verse 3]
The fields ain't what they once were
The rains just seem to flood
And I've been thinking about that river
Wondering how it turned to blood

[Outro]
I've been sitting here all morning
I was sitting here all night
There's a bible in my left hand
And a pistol in my right

[Verse 1]
Cut my teeth on daddy's old LGO
And I lost my mind somewhere in New Mexico
And TW put a snake on my back
I keep a redbone on my side

[Chorus 1]
And there's people all across the land
From East Kentucky down to Alabam'
Whole lot like I am all the time
In an outlaw state of mind

[Verse 2]
I got friends that know how to have a good time
Yeah they roll their own and drink Carolina shine
I've seen the devil in a dark coal mine
I've been higher than a Georgia pine

[Chorus 2]
And there's people all across the land
From West Virginia to The Rio Grande
Whole lot like I am all the time
In an outlaw state of mind

[Chorus 3]
Yeah there's people all across the land
From New York out to old San Fran'
Just don't give a damn all the time
In an outlaw state of mind

[Chorus]
Daddy doesn't pray anymore
I guess he's finished talkin' to the Lord
He used to fold his hands and bow his head down to the floor
But daddy doesn't pray anymore

[Verse 1]
I remember even when the times were bad
He thanked Jesus for everything he had
For a good wife and three children and the food upon our plates
Yeah, everything was right when he said grace

[Chorus]
Daddy doesn't pray anymore
I guess he's finished talkin' to the Lord
He used to fold his hands and bow his head down to the floor
But daddy doesn't pray anymore

[Verse 2]
There was a time when we didn't get along
'Cause I thought I was right and he was wrong
Still when I laid down at night I'd hear him get down on his knees
And say a little prayer for me

[Chorus]
Daddy doesn't pray anymore
I guess he's finished talkin' to the Lord
He used to fold his hands and bow his head down to the floor
But daddy doesn't pray anymore

[Interlude]

[Bridge]
Today I followed daddy down to church
And listened to the preacher read God's word
And we sang his favorite hymn but daddy didn't make a sound
And this afternoon we'll lay him in the ground

[Chorus]
Daddy doesn't pray anymore
I guess he's finally walkin' with the Lord
He used to fold his hands and bow his head down to the floor
But daddy doesn't pray anymore

[Introduction]

[Verse 1]
Yesterday just came and went
And today dealt me another hand of heartaches that I'll play
What we said and what we meant
Two different things, just some words and rings
And time keeps raising the stakes

[Verse 2]
Tonight I'll find you in my dreams
And tomorrow I'll wake up and have to feel you fade away
That's the way it goes it seems
Tears filled with pain and they fall like rain
Constant reminders every day

[Chorus]
Without your love
The sky is grey
Without your love
I'm waiting on the sun to shine
Without your love
Every hour is the darkest time of day
And every moment's a crime
And every moment's a crime

[Bridge]
The more I live without you
Just can't forget about you
Nobody else can set me free
Baby, please come back to me
Baby, please come back to me

[Chorus]
Without your love
The sky is grey
Without your love
I'm just waiting on the sun shine
Without your love
Every hour is the darkest time of day
And every moment's a crime
Without your love
And every moment's a crime
Without your love
And I'm just doing my time
Without your love
And every moment's a crime

[Refrain]
Don't put my love on your back burner
Never let anything that hot get cold
And if you ever change your mind
Want to leave my love behind
Just let me be the second one to know
Yeah, the second one to know

[Verse 1]
Hold up my right hand
Swear to the Promised Land
Rather die before I treat you bad
All I ask from you
Is to treat me the same way, too
'Cause I don't want to lose this thing we have

[Refrain]
Don't put my love on your back burner
Never let anything that hot get cold
And if you ever change your mind
Want to leave my love behind
Just let me be the second one to know
Yeah, the second one to know

[Verse 2]
First, you stole my heart
That was the easy part
Don't ever tell me that crime don't pay
Now that it's in your hands
Want you to understand
I would have given it to you anyway

[Refrain / Outro]
Don't put my love on your back burner
Never let anything that hot get cold
And if you ever change your mind
Wanna leave my love behind
Just let me be the second one to know
Yeah, the second one to know

[Verse 1]
Say what's wrong my longtime friend
Something's bothering you
Tell me what the problem is
I'll see what I can do
There are times we disagree
We agree more than we don't
We won't always see eye to eye
But we will more than we won't

[Chorus]
We got friendship
The kind that lasts a lifetime
Through all the hardship
You know you're a friend of mine
We got friendship
The kind that lasts a lifetime
Through all the hardship
You know you're a friend of mine

[Verse 2]
If you're on the street, I'll take your hand
If you're hungry, I'll give you food
If it's money you need, I got some saved
If you're sick, I'll visit you
I've been where you are right now
You saw me through it all
I'll lean on you, you can lean on me
I'm never gonna let you fall

[Chorus]
'Cause we got friendship
The kind that lasts a lifetime
Through all the hardship
You know you're a friend of mine
We got friendship
The kind that lasts a lifetime
Through all the hardship
You know you're a friend of mine

[Verse 3]
Talk to me, old pal of mine
If you feel you can't go on
Don't you sweat, it ain't over yet
This bond we share is strong
Now, your welfare is my concern
You weigh less than you think
I'll carry you through the sinking sand
See if I let you sink

[Chorus]
'Cause we got friendship
The kind that lasts a lifetime
Through all the hardship
You know you're a friend of mine
We got friendship
The kind that lasts a lifetime
Through all the hardship
You know you're a friend of mine

[Outro]
Yeah, we got friendship
The kind that lasts a lifetime
Through all the hardship
You know you're a friend of mine
Through all the hardship
You know you're a friend of mine

[Verse 1]
Well she said she didn't love me
And kicked me out the door
Now I'm livin' in one room
And sleepin' on the floor
I think I'm gonna kick my boots off
And put some music on
And since I'm all alone
I might as well get stoned

[Chorus]
I might as well get stoned
And get it off my mind
Ain't got a thing to do
All I've got is time
The bottle's all I've had
To be a friend of mine
And since my whiskey's gone
I might as well get stoned

[Verse 2]
Every time I watch the TV
Another soldier dies
Another brother's gone
Another mother cries
Now I know they've got a job to do
But if I had one wish
I wish they'd all come home
So we could all get stoned

[Chorus]
I might as well get stoned
And get it off my mind
Ain't got shit to do
All I've got is time
The bottle's all I've had
To be a friend of mine
And since my whiskey's gone
I might as well get stoned

[Outro]
Might as well get stoned
Oh, might as well get stoned
Might as well get stoned

[Verse 1]
Lately things are on my mind
Good news is hard to find
And I work on the factory line
And all I do is stay behind
Call my mama like I should
She says daddy ain't doing too good
Me and him should wet a line
Just can't seem to find the time

[Chorus]
But I love my life
Man it's something to see
It's the kids and the dogs and you and me
It's the way it's alright when everything goes wrong
It's the sound of a slow simple song

[Verse 2]
Finally saved some money up
'Til I had to fix my truck
Talked to brother the other day
He didn't have too much to say
Tryna quit these cigarettes
I can't seem to kick em yet
Sister got laid off last fall
And I got high cholesterol

[Chorus]
But I love my life
Man it's something to see
It's the kids and the dogs and you and me
It's the way it's alright when everything goes wrong
It's the sound of a slow simple song

But I love my life
Man it's something to see
It's the kids and the dogs and you and me
It's the way it's alright when everything goes wrong
It's the sound of a slow simple song

[Verse 1]
Wish I could come home from workin'
And not have her checking  my breath
I'm tired of her turning her questions
Into the Gettysburg Address
There's no reason why she shouldn't trust me
The fact that she don't makes me mad
Can't count all the times that I've begged her
Honey, just let my past be the past

[Chorus]
I used to drink like a fish and run like a dog
Done a whole lotta shit not permitted by law
People called me the Picasso of painting the town
I've finally grown up
I've finally changed and that someone I was
Is somebody I ain't
But she finds it hard to believe that she's turned me around
So I'll probably die before I live all my
Up to no good livin' down

[Verse 2]
Gave up on bringing her flowers
That just kept making things worse
I ain't been guilty of nothing
But being the man she deserves

[Chorus]
I used to drink like a fish and run like a dog
Done a whole lotta shit not permitted by law
People called me the Picasso of painting the town
I've finally grown up
I've finally changed and that someone I was
Is somebody I ain't
But she finds it hard to believe that she's turned me around
So I'll probably die before I live all my
Up to no good livin' down

I used to cuss like a sailor and howl at the moon
And I woke up some morning with I-don't-know-who
But I never dreamed back then I'd have to pay for it now
You know, I'll probably die before I live all my
Up to no good livin' down
Yeah, I'll have to die before I live all my
Up to no good livin' down

[Verse 1]
I've been thinking 'bout my thoughtless words
And I know just how much they must have hurt
And I take it back
Oh, won't you let me take it back

[Verse 2]
I know I told you that I don't love you
And I'd be better off with someone new
But I take it back
Won't you let me take it back

[Chorus]
Girl, you know that I still love you
And you know that I'm so alone
I don't know why I told you that I didn't need you
Can't you see that, baby, I was wrong

[Bridge]
What I wouldn't give to be your lover again
All I want to do is touch your skin, yeah
If I had you right here, right now
I'd tell you, tell you, tell you, tell you

[Chorus]
Girl, you know that I still love you
And you know that I'm so alone
And I don't know why I told you that I didn't need you
Can't you see that, baby, I was wrong

[Verse 1]
I put that record on
Girl, you know what song
And I let it play again and again
You're in every line
Takes me back in time
Yeah, tonight I'm wondering

[Chorus]
What are you listening to?
Is it a cover band?
In some college town bar
Where it's na, na, na's
And air guitars
Or is it?
Something to get you through
Just a sad song playing on the radio station
Tears still falling
Heart's still breaking
'Cause you're hanging on
Or is it a love song?
About someone new?
What are you listening to?

[Verse 2]
I like to believe
That you're just like me
Trying to figure out how a good thing goes bad
I don't know
I can't let it go
Yeah, it's about to drive me mad

[Chorus]
What are you listening to?
Is it a cover band?
In some college town bar
Where it's na, na, na's
And air guitars
Or is it?
Something to get you through
Just a sad song playing on the radio station
Tears still falling
Heart's still breaking
'Cause you're hanging on
Or is it a love song?
About someone new?
What are you listening to?

[Bridge]
Is it a feel good song
Gets you driving too fast
The one that gets you moving
On past the past
Or the kind that you can't help singing along
Singing woah-oh-oh-ohhh
If it's headphones on
On a downtown train
Or the window seat
On an outbound plane
Is it LA sunny?
Or Memphis blue?
I wish I knew
I wish I knew

[Chorus]
What are you listening to?
Is it a cover band?
In some college town bar
Where it's na, na, na's
And air guitars
Or is it?
Something to get you through
Just a sad song playing on the radio station
Tears still falling
Heart's still breaking
'Cause you're hanging on
Or is it a love song?
About someone new?
What are you listening to?

[Verse 1]
Well up here's the window sitting way up high
I can't look up enough to see the sky
There ain't no good light here below
Death Row
Death Row

[Verse 2]
Don't want no preacher man to come around
I don't need him to lay my burden down
Already told Jesus everything I know
Death Row
Death Row

[Verse 3]
When it's time for my last request
Tell my mama that I did my best
Tell my baby that I love her so
Death Row
Death Row
Death Row
Death Row

[Verse 4]
Got a calendar up on my wall
Marking days till I get the call
Till it's time for me to go
Death Row
Death Row

[Verse 1]
I get drunk and talk to God
I say I'm sorry for all the things I'm not
And I mean every word I say
And I promise I can change
When I get drunk and talk to God

[Verse 2]
When I talk to God I tell him why we're through
I tell him all the things I did and didn't do
I'll say, "I can't be alone"
And he'll say, "Son, you're on your own"
'Cause when I talk to God I tell him why we're through

[Chorus]
I wish that I could go to church but I'm too ashamed of me
I hate the fact it takes a bottle to get me on my knees
And I hope he'll forgive the things you ain't forgot
When I get drunk and talk to God

[Verse 3]
When I talk to God I thank him for the time
All those precious years that you were mine, all mine
I know he's a busy man, he'll help me if he can
So when I talk to God I thank him for the time

[Chorus]
I wish that I could go to church but I'm too ashamed of me
I hate the fact it takes a bottle to get me on my knees
And I hope he'll forgive the things you ain't forgot
When I get drunk and talk to God

Oh, when I get drunk and talk to God

[Verse 1]
There are days that I can walk around like I'm alright
And I pretend to wear a smile on my face
And I can keep the pain from comin' out of my eyes
But sometimes, sometimes

[Chorus]
Sometimes I cry
Cry
Sometimes I cry
When I can't do nothing else

Everybody keeps tellin' me move on
Aw, but I can't seem to go anywhere without you
'Cause ever since and every single night you've been gone
Sometimes, sometimes

[Chorus]
Sometimes I cry
Cry
Sometimes I cry
When I can't do nothing else

[Guitar Solo]

[Chorus]
Sometimes I cry
Sometimes I cry
Sometimes I cry
When I can't do nothing else

[Spoken Outro]

[Verse 1]
Livin' hard was easy when I was young and bullet-proof
I had no chains to bind me, just a guitar and a roof
Emptied every bottle, when I poured I never missed
I had blood shot eyes at twenty-five or was it twenty-six

[Verse 2]
Didn't seem to matter what price I had to pay
'Cause anything worth havin', I’d just lose anyway
Friends worried about me they’d asked if I was sick
Thought I wouldn’t die at twenty-five or was it twenty-six

[Chorus]
Those two years run together like whiskey over ice
Meltin' into memories like somebody else's life
I’m glad to say, I’ve come around
But if I could have one wish
I’d like another try at twenty-five
Or was it twenty-six

[Verse 3]
Met a girl from Georgia, smart and pretty, college grad
I thought my luck was changin' but then it all went bad
I guess I fell in love with her all it took was just one kiss
But then she said goodbye at twenty-five or was it twenty-six

[Chorus]
Those two years run together like whiskey over ice
Meltin' into memories like somebody else's life
I’m glad to say, I’ve come around
But if I could have one wish
I’d like another try at twenty-five
Or was it twenty-six

[Verse 4]
I've been down that road before almost as far as hell
Deception or redemption, I guess only time will tell
I have faith and the knowledge that God gave us a gift
I couldn't hide at twenty-five or was it twenty-six

[Chorus]
Those two years run together like whiskey over ice
Meltin' into memories like somebody else's life
I’m glad to say, I’ve come around
But if I could have one wish
I’d like another try at twenty-five
Or was it twenty-six

[Verse 1]
Sittin' here, it's closing time
You've got your troubles and I bet they're just like mine
Somebody told you goodbye

[Verse 2]
I know a way, can't go wrong
Nobody leads nobody on
Nobody's lonely tonight

[Chorus]
What's love but just some illusion we believe
What's love but just some confusion we don't need

[Interlude]

[Chorus]
What's love but just some illusion we believe
What's love but just some confusion we don't need

[Outro]
You be her and I'll be him
For a while we'll pretend
Nobody's lonely tonight

[Introduction]
Oh!

[Verse 1]
Well, judge looked down, gave me forty days
Instead of the fine that I could not pay
Said "Walk right, you'll soon be home
Cross the line, you'll be on your own"

[Chorus]
Forty days of shotguns and barbed wire fences
Forty nights to sit and listen
To the midnight train to Memphis

[Verse 2]
Well now, whistle blows when the sun comes up
Head to floor, keep your big mouth shut
Eat your breakfast on the ground
Work like hell till the sun goes down

[Chorus]
Forty days of shotguns and barbed wire fences
Forty nights to sit and listen
To the midnight train to Memphis

[Verse 3]
Well now, ten for the jury, ten for the judge
Twenty more to forget my grudge
When I get to thirty-nine
That's the longest day in a prisoner's mind

[Chorus]
Forty days of shotguns and barbed wire fences
Forty nights to sit and listen
To the midnight train to Memphis

[Outro]
Midnight train to Memphis
Midnight train to Memphis
Oh, Midnight train to Memphis

[Verse 1]
One wore blue, and one wore grey
As they marched along the way
A fife and  drum began to play
All on a beautiful morning

[Verse 2]
One was gentle, and one was kind
One came home, one stayed behind
A cannonball, don't pay no mind
All on a beautiful morning

[Verse 3]
Cannonball, don't pay no mind
Though you're gentle, or you're kind
It don't think of the folks behind
All on a beautiful morning

[Verse 4]
Two girls waiting by the railroad track
For their darlings to come back
One wore blue, and one wore black
All on a beautiful morning

[Verse 1]
Baby, I've been thinkin'
Lord knows I've been drink
That's why I went and called you
On the telephonr
This bottle's got me wonderin
If you could use a long lost friend
Please, baby, please
Fool me again

[Pre-Chorus]
I love you and I need you
Let me hold you one last time
Then I can make-believe honey
That you're still mine

[Chorus]
Woman, oh woman pretend you love me
Like you did back then
Please, baby, please
Fool me again

[Verse 2]
Baby, I've been cryin'
'Cause lord knows I feel like dyin'
Ever since you went and walked right
Out of my life, girl that wasn't nice
So I've been here in this bar room
Drownin' memories from way back when
So tonight, oh, just tonight
Fool me again

[Solo]

[Pre-Chorus]
I love you and I need you
Let me hold you one last time
Then I can make-believe honey
That you're still mine

[Chorus]
Woman, oh woman pretend you love me
Like you did back then
Please, baby please
Fool me again
Please, baby please
Fool me again

[Verse 1]
The postman delivered, a "past due" bill notice
The alarm clock rang two hours late
The garbage man left all the trash on the sidewalk
And the hinges fell off of the gate
And this morning at breakfast, I spilled all the coffee
And opened the door on my knee

[Refrain]
Oh, the last thing I needed, the first thing this morning
Was to have you walk out on me

[Verse 2]
Last night you came home late, and I knew you'd been drinking
By that old mellow look on your face
And I thought, "It don't matter, 'cause it's the holiday season"
And you fill such a big empty space
And I laid down beside you, and I wanted your loving
'Cause your love makes my life complete

[Refrain]
Oh, the last thing I needed, the first thing this morning
Was to have you walk out on me

[Verse 3]
So excuse me for looking, like my world just ended
And excuse me for looking, like I just lost my best friend
And excuse me for loving, and being forgiving
So just go on if you want to be free

[Refrain / Outro]
The last thing I needed, the first thing this morning
Was to have you walk out on me
Oh, the last thing I needed, the first thing this morning
Was to have you walk out on me

[Verse 1]
We drove all night to Billings, Montana
Flew into Utah, slept there all day
I can’t remember stopping in Denver
Yeah, I live my illusion that somebody needs me to play

[Chorus 1]
Sometimes I’m drunk
Sometimes I’m stoned
And yes, I get tired of being alone
I miss my son
I miss my wife
But the devil named music is taking my life

[Verse 2]
Now I sold my soul a long time ago
I put it in a six string and a sad melody
And I’m sometimes a winner, most times a loser
If the crowd gets into it, it’ll all feel the same way to me

[Chorus 2]
Sometimes I’m drunk
Sometimes I’m stoned
And yes, I get tired of being alone
I miss my daughter
I miss my wife
But the devil named music is taking my life

[Chorus 1]
Sometimes I’m drunk
Sometimes I’m stoned
And yes, I get tired of being alone
I miss my son
I miss my wife
But the devil named music is taking my life

[Chorus 2]
Sometimes I’m drunk
Sometimes I’m stoned
And yes, I get tired of being alone
I miss my daughter
I miss my wife
But the devil named music is taking my life

But the devil named music is taking my life

[Chorus]
This morning I smoked them stems
Yeah, that's the kinda shape I'm in
I'm in a bad, bad way again
'Cause this morning I smoked them stems

[Verse 1]
My dealer, he's been out of town
And that's really got me down
I hope he ain't up in the pen again
'Cause this morning I smoked them stems

[Chorus]
This morning I smoked them stems
Yeah, that's the kinda shape I'm in
I'm in a bad, bad way again
'Cause this morning I smoked them stems

[Verse 2]
My baby, she done said goodbye
And all I ever do is cry
There ain't nothing round the house now to make me grin
'Cause this morning I smoked them stems

[Chorus]
This morning I smoked them stems
Yeah, that's the kinda shape I'm in
I'm in a bad, bad way again
'Cause this morning I smoked them stems

[Verse 3]
I called up this buddy of mine
'Cause we always had a real good time
I was hoping I could bum a toke off of him
But this morning he smoked them stems

[Chorus]
This morning I smoked them stems
Yeah, that's the kinda shape I'm in
I'm in a bad, bad way again
'Cause this morning I smoked them stems

[Verse 1]
Well I drank a lot of whiskey in my time
And I've held a lot of women that were fine
And I made a little money, I blew every dime
Tryin' to untangle my mind
Well I've made a lot of choices that were wrong
That the good lord spend too many nights alone
And I've been out on the edge, and I've stumbled 'cross the line
Tryin' to untangle my mind

[Chorus]
So if you see me, and I'm lonesome and stoned
So far down, the devil's lookin' high
I'm just trying to untangle my mind

[Verse 2]
Well, I do what I do and I don't know why
But I do what I do, til' the day I die
No heartache for the ticket
So I guess I'll pay the fine
Tryin' to untangle my mind

[Chorus]
If you see me, and I'm lonesome and stoned
So far down, the devil's lookin' high
I'm just tryin' to untangle my mind
Yes I'm tryin' to untangle my mind

[Verse 1]
I want love, but it's impossible
A man like me, so irresponsible
A man like me is dead in places
Other men feel liberated

[Verse 2]
I can't love, shot full of holes
Don't feel nothin', I just feel cold
Don't feel nothin', just old scars
Toughenin' up around my heart

[Chorus]
But I want love, just a different kind
I want love, won't break me down
Won't brick me up, won't fence me in
I want a love, that don't mean a thing
That's the love I want
I want love

[Verse 2]
I want love on my own terms
After everything I've ever learned
Me, I carry too much baggage
Oh, man I've seen so much traffic

[Chorus]
But I want love, just a different kind
I want love, won't break me down
Won't brick me up, won't fence me in
I want a love, that don't mean a thing
That's the love I want
I want love

[Bridge]
So bring it on, I've been bruised
Don't give me love that's clean and smooth
I'm ready for the rougher stuff
No sweet romance, I've had enough

[Instrumental]

[Refrain]
Oh, a man like me is dead in places
Other men feel liberated

[Chorus]
But I want love, just a different kind
I want love, won't break me down
Won't brick me up, won't fence me in
I want a love, that don't mean a thing
That's the love I want
I want love

[Outro]
Oh, I want love, just a different kind
I want love, won't break me down
Won't brick me up, won't fence me in
I want a love, that don't mean a thing
That's the love I want
I want love

[Verse 1]
I used to love to look for a fight
I'd get drunk and shoot out the lights
I was known to get outta hand
A rough and rowdy honky tonk man

[Chorus]
Never thought it would happen to me
But this hard livin' ain't as easy as it used to be

[Verse 2]
I looked a lot, but I've never found
A woman that could settle me down
I been known to have a good time
No, I could never walk the line

[Chorus]
Never thought it would happen to me
But this hard livin' ain't as easy as it used to be

Woo!

I used to love to look for a fight
I'd get drunk and shoot out the lights
I was known to get out of hand
A rough and rowdy honky tonk man

That was all that would happen to me
This hard living ain't easy as it used to be

I looked enough that I could have found
A lover that could settle down
I was known to have a good time
No, I could never walk the line

That was all that would happen to me
This hard living ain't easy as it used to be

It was hard, hell what happened to me?
This hard living ain't easy as it used to be

[Verse 1]
I've held it all in, God knows I've tried
It's an awful awakening in a country boy's life
Look in the mirror in total surprise
At the hair on my shoulders and the age in my eyes

[Chorus]
Amanda, light of my life
Faith should have made you a gentleman's wife
Amanda, light of my life
Faith should have made you a gentleman's wife

[Verse 2]
It's a measure of people who don't understand
The pleasures of life in a hillbilly band
Got my first guitar when I was fourteen
Now I'm pushin' forty and I'm still wearin' jeans

[Chorus]
Amanda, light of my life
Faith should have made you a gentleman's wife
Amanda, light of my life
Faith should have made you a gentleman's wife

[Verse 1: Morgan Wallen]
It's Friday after 5, got here just in time
Went ahead and wet a line 'fore I went and lost my mind
I ain't been here long, but the bobber's in the pond
Going up down, up, down, up, down
Tonight, we're gonna raise a whole lot more than cane
'Cause there's money in the bank and tomorrow's Saturday
So if they pass that fifth of Jack this way
I turn it up, down, up, down, up, down

[Chorus: Morgan Wallen & Florida Georgia Line]
We just holding it down here in BFE
Still rolling around with a burnt CD
Free Bird, five minutes deep
Head bobbing up, down, up, down, up, down
We got what we got, we don't need the rest
Can turn this parking lot into a party
With an ice chest, dancing, cold beer
Man, we live it up, down, up, down
We live it up down...here

[Verse 2: Florida Georgia Line]
Yeah, the girls, they hit the spot, even hotter when it's hot
If you can't buy her a yacht, but still proud of what you got
'Cause when the day's done, red neck is from the sun
Going up, down, up, down, up, down

[Chorus: Morgan Wallen & Florida Georgia Line]
We just holding it down here in BFE
Still rolling around with a burnt CD
Free Bird, five minutes deep
Head bobbing up, down, up, down, up, down
We got what we got, we don't need the rest
Can turn this parking lot into a party
With an ice chest, dancing, cold beer
Man, we live it up, down, up, down
We live it up, down here

[Bridge: Morgan Wallen & Florida Georgia Line]
Somebody pass that fifth of Camp this way
I'll turn it up, down, up, down, up, down

[Chorus: Both, Morgan Wallen]
We just holding it down here in BFE
Still rolling around with a burnt CD
Free Bird, five minutes deep
Head bobbing up, down, up, down, up, down
We got what we got, we don't need the rest
Can turn this parking lot into a party
With an ice chest, dancing, cold beer
Man, we live it up, down, up, down
We live it up, down here

[Verse 1]
Poor me, pour me another drink
'Cause I don't wanna feel a thing
No more, hell nah
I just wanna sip 'til the pain wears off
Poor me, pour me another round
Line 'em up and knock 'em down
Two more let's go
'Cause I ain't never hurt like this before

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't wanna think about her
Or wear a ring without her
Don't wanna hit the karaoke bar
Can't sing without her
So make them drinks strong
'Cause brother she's gone
And if I'm ever gonna move on

[Chorus]
I'ma need some whiskey glasses
'Cause I don't wanna see the truth
She's probably making out on the couch right now
With someone new
Yeah, I'ma need some whiskey glasses
If I'm gonna make it through
If I'ma be single
I'ma need a double shot of that heartbreak proof
And see the world through whiskey glasses
(Ain't nothing else to do, but sip around the truth)
And see the world through whiskey glasses
(I need a better view, where I don't drink to you)

[Verse 2]
Last call
I swear this will be my last call
Now I ain't drunk dialing no more at 3 am
Mr. Bartender hittin' me again

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't wanna think about her
Or wear a ring without her
Don't wanna hit the karaoke bar
Can't sing without her
So make them drinks strong
'Cause brother she's gone
And if I'm ever gonna move on

[Chorus]
I'ma need some whiskey glasses
'Cause I don't wanna see the truth
She's probably making out on the couch right now
With someone new
Yeah, I'ma need some whiskey glasses
If I'm gonna make it through
If I'ma be single
I'ma need a double shot of that heartbreak proof
And see the world through whiskey glasses
(Ain't nothing else to do, but sip around the truth)
Oh, see the world through whiskey glasses
(I need a better view, where I don't drink to you)

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Line 'em up, line 'em up, line 'em up, line 'em up
Knock 'em back, knock 'em back, knock 'em back, knock 'em back
Fill 'em up, fill 'em up, fill 'em up, fill 'em up
'Cause if she ain't ever coming back
Line 'em up, line 'em up, line 'em up, line 'em up
Knock 'em back, knock 'em back, knock 'em back, knock 'em back
Fill 'em up, fill 'em up, fill 'em up, fill 'em up
'Cause if she ain't ever coming back

[Chorus]
I'ma need some whiskey glasses
'Cause I don't wanna see the truth
She's probably making out on the couch right now
With someone new
Yeah, I'ma need some whiskey glasses
If I'm gonna make it through
If I'ma be single
I'ma need a double shot of that heartbreak proof
And see the world through whiskey glasses
(Ain't nothing else to do, but sip around the truth)
Oh, see the world through whiskey glasses
(I need a better view, where I don't drink to you)
Yeah

[Outro]
(Ain't nothing else to do, but sip around the truth)
And see the world through whiskey glasses
(I need a better view, where I don't drink to you)
Yeah

[Verse 1]
It's got a touch of the town where I grew up
Something in it them California girls love
Some people like to make a little fun of
The way I talk
It gets slower after three or four cold beers
And gets louder when I'm cheerin' on the Volunteers
Folks know I'm country, when they hear
The way I talk

[Chorus]
It sounds a little bit like my daddy
It don't cuss around my mama
Got some words you've never heard
'Less you come from down yonder
The man upstairs gets it
So I ain't tryna fix it
No, I can't hide it
I don't fight it, I just roll with it
Oh, kinda slow like the Mississippi rolls
It's the only way I know
Man it ain't my fault
I just live the way I talk

[Verse 2]
Yeah it's, "Yes sir, no ma'am, y'all come back, now"
Fightin' words if you run my last name down
I ain't ashamed, matter of fact I'm damn proud
Of the way I talk, y'all

[Chorus]
It sounds a little bit like my daddy
It don't cuss around my mama
Got some words you've never heard
'Less you come from down yonder
The man upstairs gets it
So I ain't tryna fix it
No, I can't hide it
I don't fight it, I just roll with it
Oh, kinda slow like the Mississippi rolls
It's the only way I know
Man it ain't my fault
I just live the way I talk

[Bridge]
Slow, like a Sunday morning service back home
And kinda sweet when I got a girl to love on
If you know me, you know

[Chorus]
It sounds a little bit like my daddy
It don't cuss around my mama
Got some words you've never heard
'Less you come from down yonder
The man upstairs gets it
So I ain't tryna fix it
No I can't hide it
I don't fight it, I just roll with it
Oh, kinda slow like the Mississippi rolls
It's the only way I know
Man it ain't my fault
I just live the way I talk
The way I talk

[Verse 1]
A heart on the run keeps a hand on the gun
You can't trust anyone
I was so sure what I needed was more
Tried to shoot out the sun
The days when we raged, we flew off the page
Such damage was done
But I made it through, 'cause somebody knew
I was meant for someone

[Chorus 1]
So girl, leave your boots by the bed
We ain't leaving this room
'Til someone needs medical help
Or the magnolias bloom
It's cold in this house and I ain't going out to chop wood
So cover me up and know you're enough
To use me for good

[Verse 2]
I put your faith to the test when I tore off your dress
In Richmond on High
I sobered up, I swore off that stuff
Forever this time
And the old lover's sing
“I thought it'd be me who helped him get home”
But home was a dream
One that I'd never seen 'til you came along

[Chorus 2]
So girl, hang your dress out to dry
We ain't leaving this room
'Til Percy Priest breaks open wide
And the river runs through
And carries this house on the stones
Like a piece of driftwood
Cover me up and know you're enough
To use me for good

[Chorus 1]
So girl, leave your boots by the bed
We ain't leaving this room
'Til someone needs medical help
Or the magnolias bloom
It's cold in this house and I ain't going out to chop wood
So cover me up and know you're enough
To use me for good
So cover me up and know you're enough
To use me for good

[Verse 1]
We used to chase that Chattanooga freight
Couple of kids in a Chevrolet
Catch a little air when we cross the tracks
Sipping on something from a paper sack
You hang your shirt on that maple limb
Slipping through the moon to the river bend
Wasn't very long til I was jumping in, jumping in
I guess I'm still doing now what I was doing then

[Chorus]
Chasing you like a shot of whiskey
Burning going down, burning going down
Chasing you like those goodbye tail lights
Headed west to anywhere out of this nowhere town
Chasing that freedom, chasing that feeling that got gone too soon
Chasing that you and me, I only see in my rear view
Yeah, I'm laying here tonight holding someone new
Still chasing you, still chasing you

[Verse 2]
You always used to talk about LA
I heard you got as far as Santa Fe
Well you know I tried to track you down
I only got as far as Guitar Town
Singing about a girl I used to know, used to know
Well you should know that I haven't given up
I'm just on your radio

[Chorus]
Chasing you like a shot of whiskey
Burning going down, burning going down
Chasing you like those goodbye tail lights
Headed west to anywhere out of this nowhere town
Chasing that freedom, chasing that feeling that got gone too soon
Chasing that you and me, I only see in my rear view
Yeah, I'm laying here tonight holding someone new
Still chasing you, still chasing you

[Outro]
Chasing you like a shot of whiskey
Burning going down, burning going down
Chasing you like those goodbye tail lights
Headed west to anywhere out of this nowhere town
Chasing that freedom, chasing that feeling that got gone too soon
Chasing that you and me, I only see in my rear view
Yeah, I'm laying here tonight holding someone new
Still chasing you, still chasing you
Still chasing you, still chasing you

[Verse 1]
You say you need a couple credits 'fore they'll let you out of college
I bet you bought that beer with your Daddy's card
You're looking like you probably get a little tired of all this
Attention that you're getting when you go to the bar

[Pre-Chorus]
We can take a different route
I know you're from a different town
But you're here for now
So whatcha say we get on out and see where this night leads?

[Chorus]
If I know me, I'll have you hopping up in my passenger seat
Bet I take you home and you ain't gonna wanna leave
Make a little love at a quarter past three
Gotta keep it down 'cause your roommate's home
Honey, when the sun come peeking through the trees
You ain't gotta worry 'bout what it might be
'Cause I bet it won't be the last time you're waking up next to me
If I know me, if I know me (Woah, woah)

[Verse 2]
This ain't some routine that I use every Friday
This ain't a one line, one night kiss and tell
But ever since I caught you looking over my way
All that I could do was tell myself

[Chorus]
If I know me, I'll have you hopping up in my passenger seat
Bet I take you home and you ain't gonna wanna leave
Make a little love at a quarter past three
Gotta keep it down 'cause your roommate's home
Honey, when the sun come peeking through the trees
You ain't gotta worry 'bout what it might be
'Cause I bet it won't be the last time you're waking up next to me
If I know me (Woah, woah)

[Bridge]
(Ooh, ooh)
And I could just change my mind
And leave my number in your phone (Ooh, ooh)
And give you a kiss goodnight
And go home alone

[Chorus]
But if I know me, I'll have you hopping up in my passenger seat
Bet I take you home and you ain't gonna wanna leave
Make a little love at a quarter past three
Gotta keep it down 'cause your roommate's home
Honey, when the sun come peeking through the trees
You ain't gotta worry 'bout what it might be
'Cause I bet it won't be the last time you're waking up next to me
'Cause I know me

[Verse 1]
Maybe it's your bad girl, underneath that sweet smile
Like a peek of black lace that nobody but me sees
Just a trace of all the possibilities
Maybe it's the quarter moon, maybe it's the quart of wine
That we haven't even touched yet, baby don't need it
Everything you're doing, girl is my weakness

[Chorus]
I'm not good at not kissin' again
When you're leanin' it on in a little closer
I'm not good at not getting sidetracked
When your tank top strap's slippin' off of your shoulder
Ohhh, girl, I try to be, but I ain't that tough
I'm not good at not fallin' in love, fallin' in love, fallin' in love

[Verse 2]
You know what you're doin' girl
You know what it does to me
When you turn on that song, and turn the lights down
Baby I'm gone, before the part about you
Dancin' in slow motion with my hands on your hips
Now you got me going right where I can't resist

[Chorus]
I'm not good at not kissin' again
When you're leanin' it on in a little closer
I'm not good at not getting sidetracked
When your tank top strap's slipping off of your shoulder
Ohh girl, I try to be, but I ain't that tough
I'm not good at not fallin' in love, fallin' in love, fallin' in love

[Bridge]
Can't tell you no
Can't say goodbye
Can't hold a little bit back even if I tried
'Cause when I look in your eyes

[Chorus]
I'm not good at not kissin' again
When you're leanin' it on in a little closer
I'm not good at not getting sidetracked
When your tank top strap's slipping off of your shoulder
Girl, I try to be, but I ain't that tough
I'm not good at not fallin' in love, fallin' in love, fallin' in love

[Verse 1]
You say those city boys living in those high rise condos
Only left you feeling low
Those little smoke glass fancy cars sure go fast
But never got you where you wanted to go
All I've ever owned is an old Chevy truck
Cuddled up, get you falling in love on the bench seat

[Chorus]
Don't mind me, I'm just talking Tennessee
Girl don't blame me if I slip and call you baby
That's just my way of letting the lady know she's working on me
There I go letting my South side show
Whiskey whispering those little sweet nothing southernisms
Jack and seven sipping, hoping that you're digging on me
Talking Tennessee

[Verse 2]
You say the street lights only ever let you see the skyline
It's been a long time
Since the Milky Way, Jupiter, and Venus took your breath away
Yeah like you're taking mine
What you say we grab some tailgate underneath the stars
Catch a few fireflies in a moonshine jar

[Chorus]
Don't mind me, I'm just talking Tennessee
Girl don't blame me if I slip and call you baby
That's just my way of letting the lady know she's working on me
There I go letting my South side show
Whiskey whispering those little sweet nothing southernisms
Jack and seven sipping, hoping that you're digging on me
Talking Tennessee

[Bridge]
There I go letting my South side show
Whiskey whispering those little sweet nothing southernisms
Jack and seven sipping, hoping that you're digging on me
Talking Tennessee

[Outro]
Talking Tennessee
Talking Tennessee

[Verse 1]
I've been lookin' at you from across the room
'Bout time I got my nerve
Well you might tell me "Boy hell naw"
But hell what can it hurt?
'Cause I just wanna

[Chorus]
Spin you around, around this dance floor
Get you drunk on a love like mine
Might wind up and steal a couple kisses
Get your digits if I can find the right line
And you don't do feelin's, and baby if you're willin'
I'ma do my best to change your mind
'Cause the way you stole my heart without a sign
Girl it oughta be a crime

[Verse 2]
Got a pretty good feelin' I'm takin' you home
Gonna love you with all I got
But before we slip out into the night
I just want one more shot
To take your hand and

[Chorus]
Spin you around, around this dance floor
Get you drunk on a love like mine
Might wind up and steal a couple kisses
Get your digits if I can find the right line
And you don't do feelin's, and baby if you're willin'
I'ma do my best to change your mind
'Cause the way you stole my heart without a sign
Girl it oughta be a crime

[Bridge]
I fought in some bars, broken some laws
Ain't done nothin' this bad
Yeah, with one look at me you became my disease
They don't make no cure for that

[Chorus]
And I just wanna
Spin you around, around this dance floor
Get you drunk on a love like mine
Might wind up and steal a couple kisses
Get your digits if I can find the right line
And you don't do feelin's, and baby if you're willin'
I'ma do my best to change your mind
'Cause the way you stole my heart
Yeah, the way you stole my heart
Yeah, the way you stole my heart without a sign
Girl it oughta be a crime
I just wanna spin you around tonight
I just wanna spin you around tonight

[Verse 1]
Looking back I see a million little things that wrecked us
She never liked my pickup truck parked up beside her Lexus
And I never wore them khakis like she asked me
Just trashy old blue jeans, old Skoal ring

[Pre-Chorus]
She packed up her Chanel, said 'go to hell', taught me a lesson
And now as far as she's concerned
I'm in a deep and dark depression

[Chorus]
But it's happy hour, drinking double shooters
Buying whiskey sours for a pack of cougars
I know I should be sadder but it all seems silly
'Cause my good buddy Waylon hooked me up with some willie
Girl, I know a breakup ain't supposed to be fun
But I'm here at happy hour, happy ours is done, yeah

[Verse 2]
And I know she'll hear about my 'paint the town red' gallivanting
And she'll think I thought of her curves when I found that gal to dance with
And she'll tell her friends I'm faking, my hearts breaking, time will take away my grin
But not when every bar I stumble in

[Chorus]
Is happy hour, drinking double shooters
Buying whiskey sours for a pack of cougars
I know I should be sadder but it all seems silly
'Cause my good buddy went and hooked me up with some willie
Girl, I know a breakup ain't supposed to be fun
But I'm here at happy hour, happy ours is done

[Bridge]
Well it'll make her feel much better if she thinks my life is hell
Tell her ever since she left me it's like time is standing still

[Chorus]
And it's happy hour, drinking double shooters
Buying whiskey sours for a pack of cougars
I know I should be sadder but it all seems silly
'Cause my good buddy went and hooked me up with some willie
Girl, I know a breakup ain't supposed to be fun
But I'm here at happy hour, happy ours is done
Yeah, I'm here at happy hour, happy ours is done, yeah

[Verse 1]
Watcha know about thumping skeeters with your fingers
With a stringer full of keepers under thunderhead clouds?
Whatcha know about picking off a blackberry?
Little Cherry Skoal Dip make the swelling go down

[Pre-Chorus]
Mmm girl, lucky for you I'm a two lane tour guide
Mmm get your country boy heartbreaking certified

[Chorus]
Let's order up a couple longnecks
Maybe take a two step or two
Teach you how to yaw with a Southern drawl
Get you falling 'fore the night is through
And we'll park in it the boons
And catch a little moon tan
By the time you go back
And you'll be city girl, buzzin' over country boy loving
Tellin' everybody that you know whatchu know about that
Yeah, whatchu know about that?

[Verse 2]
Whatchu know about that Saturday summer
Heat deep creek creeping down around a bend
And whatchu know about taking off what you bought at the mall
Hang it all on a sycamore limb

[Pre-Chorus]
Mmm, we can get on out where the cowboy hats flow
Mmm, ay whatchu know about a hillbilly backstroke?

[Chorus]
Let's order up a couple longnecks
Maybe take a two step or two
Teach you how to yaw with a Southern drawl
Get you falling 'fore the night is through
And we'll park in it the boons
And catch a little moon tan
By the time you go back (if you go back)
And you'll be city girl, buzzin' over country boy loving
Tellin' everybody that you know whatchu know about that

[Bridge]
Sippin' on shiners, diners, sugar pies
Bobbers and cane poles
Kissing in the fireflies
Bet you gonna smile when you get back home
And that Nitty Gritty song comes on on your phone
'Cause thats my ringtone, ha
(You and me)
You and me, yeah

[Chorus]
Let's order up a couple longnecks
Maybe take a two step or two
Teach you how to yaw with a southern drawl
Get you falling 'fore the night is through
And we'll park in it the boons
And catch a little moon tan
By the time you go back
And you'll be city girl, buzzin' over country boy loving
Tellin' everybody that you know whatchu know about that
Yeah whatchu know about that?
(You and me)
Yeah whatchu know about that?

[Verse 1]
I'm a simple man, ain't no other way to say it
Lay my cards on the table, only way I play it
I got some draw in my y'all, they can't imitate it
Tough and rowdy reckless
Rough around the edges

[Pre-Chorus]
Ever since you came around I've been
Thinking thoughts that I need to get out so I
I grabbed a pen and a napkin and I wrote this down

[Chorus]
My tractor's green, my pasture's greener
My tea is sweet but honey, you're sweeter
My road is dirt, your heart is gold
I'm a man of few words but baby here it goes
My neck is red, my collar's blue
And I love you

[Verse 2]
Yeah, I know it might sound a little elementary
Like a nursery rhyme straight up from the country
It won't pass for Shakespeare, girl I know it
But I'ma pour my heart out like a back porch poet

[Chorus]
My tractor's green, my pasture's greener
My tea is sweet but honey, you're sweeter
My road is dirt, your heart is gold
I'm a man of few words but baby here it goes
My neck is red, my collar's blue
And I love you

[Bridge]
Yeah, I love your pretty smile
I love your skinny jeans
I love the fact that you fell for a good ol' boy like me
I love your long kiss
And I love your long hair
I wanna shout it out from the town square
That I love you
I love you, I love you

[Chorus]
Yeah, my tractor's green, my pasture's greener
My tea is sweet but honey, you're sweeter
My road is dirt, your heart is gold
I'm a man of few words but baby here it goes
My neck is red, my collar's blue

Yeah, I love your pretty smile
I love your skinny jeans
I love the fact that you fell for a good ol' boy like me
I love your long kiss
And I love your long hair
I wanna shout it out from the town square
That I love you
I love you, I love you
Yes, I do

[Verse 1]
You were talkin' trash, we were tossin' bags
When I caught your name at a corn hole game
September Saturday in Rocky Top
On top of G10 parking lot
Said "Girl, where you sittin'? I got an extra ticket
It's right on the 50"

[Chorus]
You had a 16 home team jersey on
Singin' every word to the fight song
Had your airplane bottles from your purse out
Had a country mile smile every first down
Last thing on my mind was the football
Watchin' you girl like it's gonna be a good fall
You would've thought that post-game kiss would've made me wanna make you mine
But you had me by halftime

[Verse 2]
They sent out the Pride of the Southland band
And all I could think about was holdin' your hand
Was just gonna catch it on a couch TV
And last second scored a couple tickets for free
But baby I'd have paid anything to see

[Chorus]
You had a 16 home team jersey on
Singin' every word to the fight song
Had your airplane bottles from your purse out
Had a country mile smile every first down
Last thing on my mind was the football
Watchin' you girl like it's gonna be a good fall
You would've thought that post-game kiss would've made me wanna make you mine
But you had me by halftime

[Bridge]
Now every time the leaves start fallin' down
I get to thinkin' 'bout

[Chorus]
That 16 home team jersey on
Singin' every word to the fight song
Had your airplane bottles from your purse out
Had a country mile smile every first down
Last thing on my mind was the football
Watchin' you girl like it's gonna be a good fall
You would've thought that post-game kiss would've made me wanna make you mine
But you had me by halftime
You had me by halftime
You had me by halftime

[Verse 1]
I think I'm past the point of calling you a bad habit
Ain't trying to get no sympathy, oh, sounds tragic
But it's hard for me to hide your side effects from showing
You strike the match and I burn the lanterns, embers glowing

[Pre-Chorus]
I know the first step is just to admit it
But what if I don't want to quit it
I just keep...

[Chorus]
Chain smokin' your love like a pack of Lucky Strikes
Like binge drinking old fashion cherry in the ice
Push a button, watch the needle dropping in the groove
I can't stop chain, chain smokin' you
Chain, chain, chain, chain, chain smokin' you
Chain, chain, chain, chain, chain smokin' you

[Verse 2]
I got a couple hit or miss tricks that I use for distraction
But as soon I slow down and I start flash-backing
To the night before when I was buzzing harder than that storefront neon
Yeah, if your kiss gets me this high, oh I wouldn't mind just keep on

[Chorus]
Chain smokin' your love like a pack of Lucky Strikes
Like binge drinking old fashion cherry in the ice
Push a button, watch the needle dropping in the groove
I can't stop chain, chain smokin' you

[Bridge]
Need a little rush from your touch
Little late night pick me up
When you make me come unwound
Why I can't put you down
Chain, chain, chain, chain, chain smokin' you
Chain, chain, chain, chain, chain smokin' you

[Pre-Chorus]
I know the first step is just to admit it
But what if I don't want to quit it
I just keep...

[Chorus]
Chain smokin' your love like a pack of Lucky Strikes
Like binge drinking old fashion cherry in the ice
Push a button, watch the needle dropping in the groove
I can't stop chain, chain smokin' you
Chain, chain, chain, chain, chain smokin' you
Chain, chain, chain, chain, chain smokin' you
Chain smokin' you
No, no, no, no

[Verse 1]
That grass ain't gonna cut itself
And you can't get your tan on
Underneath these covers and that four blade ceiling fan
You know I love to see you
With that two piece top untied
But I can think of something better
I ain't going to lie

[Chorus]
Yeah, I could use a little rain
Beating on the window pane
While we listen to the tin roof sing a love song all day long
Yeah I hope it pours
And our clothes stay on the floor
Yeah, that's the kind of storm that's been calling my name
Yeah, I could use a little rain
Yeah, I could use a little rain

[Verse 2]
Blame it on the fast lane
Trying to make that dollar bill
How everything we gotta do
We can't just sit and still
I know that it ain't your fault
And I hope that it ain't mine
But we been in a drought for a little too long of time

[Chorus]
I could use a little rain
Beating on the window pane
While we listen to the tin roof sing a love song all day long
Yeah I hope it pours
And our clothes stay on the floor
Yeah, that's the kind of storm that's been calling my name
Yeah, I could use a little rain
Yeah, I could use a little rain

[Bridge]
Sun sun go away
Come again some other day
Me and this girl got love to make
Yeah we got love to make
Sun sun go away
Won't you come again some other day
Me and this girl got love to make
Baby

[Chorus]
I could use a little rain
Beating on the window pane
While we listen to the tin roof sing a love song all day long
Yeah I hope it pours
And our clothes stay on the floor
Yeah, that's the kind of storm that's been calling my name
Yeah, I could use a little rain
Yeah, I could use a little rain

[Outro]
Yeah, I could use a little rain
Yeah, I could use a little rain

[Verse 1]
I made my share of empty promises
Not like you care anymore
I wish you did, but I've done all I can do
Baby, I ain't gonna chase you out that door

[Verse 2]
If you don't know by now that you're the one I love
Clearly we were never meant to be
If you'll take the words out of someone else's mouth
Before you take mine, well I got nothin' left to say

[Chorus]
Oh, I'll stand alone
It won't be the first time, or the last time that I'm gonna make it on my own
Oh, I'll stand alone
Don't be sorry, don't call me, 'cause I won't pick up my phone
I'm standin' alone

[Verse 3]
Just the other day drivin' down the highway
Seen a Chevrolet reminded me of you
I almost called, but I'm sure glad I didn't
I just shook it off and drank some Mountain Dew
You always said that it was bad for my health
Well baby you can go to hell

[Chorus]
While I stand alone
It won't be the first time, or the last time that I'm gonna make it on my own
Oh, I'll stand alone
Don't be sorry, don't call me, 'cause I won't pick up my phone
I'm standin' alone

[Bridge]
The waves will crash, and the winds will blow
But I'll be standin' on my tip toes

[Chorus]
Oh, I'll stand alone
It won't be the first time, or the last time that I'm gonna make it on my own
Oh, I'll stand alone
Don't be sorry, don't call me, 'cause I won't pick up my phone
I'm standin' alone
I'm standin' alone
I'm standin' alone
Standin' alone

[Verse 1]
It don't matter if we're out under New York lights
Or taking in the scene on Ocean Drive
Or standing underneath that Hollywood sign
In California
I always seem to miss it all
I can't focus, I get lost
And I think you know it's all your fault
Now baby, don't ya?

[Chorus]
You end up winning, baby
I can't just take one look
Everything around you fades to black
And just like that, I'm up
Girl, you don't need stilettos
To turn them heads around
You ain't gotta worry 'bout getting lost in no crowd
Oh, baby, you're a stand out (you know I get so elevated)
Oh, there ain't no doubt (you ain't routine, so far from basic)

[Verse 2]
I wanna find a club and wanna show you off
When we roll in it won't take long
Every guy with a girl, yeah, they gonna take caught
Looking
And I can't blame 'em
And girl you look famous
If I was in their shoes
I'd do the same, 'cause...

[Chorus]
You end up winning, baby
I can't just take one look
Everything around you fades to black
And just like that, I'm up
Girl, you don't need stilettos
To turn them heads around
You ain't gotta worry 'bout getting lost in a crowd
Oh, baby, you're a stand out (you know I get so elevated)
Oh, there ain't no doubt (you ain't routine, so far from basic)

[Bridge]
I always seem to miss it all, yeah
I can't focus, I get lost

[Chorus]
You end up winning, baby
I can't just take one look
Everything around you fades to black
And just like that, I'm up
Girl, you don't need stilettos
To turn them heads around
You ain't gotta worry 'bout getting lost in no crowd
Oh, baby, you're a stand out (you know I get so elevated)
Oh, there ain't no doubt (you ain't routine, so far from basic)
You're such a stand out (you know I get so elevated)
Oh, there ain't no doubt (you ain't routine, so far from basic)

[Verse 1]
Blue ribbon bottles
Big black throttles
Marlborough's if you want 'em
Go on and take a drag
Little small town freedom
Little taste of dreaming
No need to preach, no need to shout, we believe in

[Chorus]
American nights
Wanted line
Cutting down Main Street in the dark
Muscle shows, muscle cars
Earning our stripes underneath these stars

[Verse 2]
Faded Levi's
Worn out Chuck's
20 in my pocket
Feels like a million bucks
Blue eyed beauty, lean into me
Our own show in the back row
Miss the whole damn movie

[Chorus]
American nights
Wanted line
Cutting down Main Street in the dark
Muscle shows, muscle cars
Earning our stripes underneath these stars
American nights

[Bridge]
Pray the morning don't come
These colours don't run
Stay up and stay young

[Chorus]
American nights, American nights
Wanted line
Cutting down Main Street in the dark
Muscle shows, muscle cars
Earning our stripes underneath these stars
American nights, American nights
American nights, American nights

[Outro]
Pray the morning don't come
Stay up and stay young

[Chorus]
If I ever get you back I'ma treat you like a queen
Make a livin' lovin' you, a lot of kissin' in between
I'll be looking for a reason just to please you
That's the world that you'll be living in
Girl, if I ever get you back
I ain't gon' ever have to get you back again

[Verse 1]
I see you dancing with Mr. Handsome
He looks like he's a real romancer
I'm just hoping and I'm praying that one day I hear you saying
That you gon' give me that second chance and take me back
And we gon' roll through life in a Cadillac

[Chorus]
If I ever get you back I'ma treat you like a queen
Make a livin' lovin' you, a lot of kissin' in between
I'll be looking for a reason just to please you
That's the world that you'll be living in
Girl, if I ever get you back
I ain't gon' ever have to get you back again
No I ain't

[Interlude]

[Verse 2]
I'll buy you flowers, talk for hours
Write your name up on the water tower
Keep you covered up in diamonds
Make your smile light up just like 'em
I'm gon' "Yes ma'am" you "No ma'am" you, open up your door
And I'ma give you all my heart and a whole lot more

[Chorus]
If I ever get you back I'ma treat you like a queen
Make a livin' lovin' you, a lot of kissin' in between
I'll be looking for a reason just to please you
That's the world that you'll be living in
Girl, if I ever get you back
I ain't gon' ever have to get you back again
Not this time

[Bridge]
I'm gonna "Yes ma'am" you "No ma'am" you, open up your door
And I'ma give you all my heart and a whole lot more

[Chorus]
If I ever get you back I'ma treat you like a queen
Make a livin' lovin' you, a lot of kissin' in between
I'll be looking for a reason just to please you
That's the world that you'll be living in
Girl, if I ever get you back
I ain't gon' ever have to get you back again
Not this time

[Verse 1]
That DJ on the side stage ain't played one song I like
It's all craft beer served in here, can't even get a cold Bud Light
I see you sittin' over there barely sippin' your drink
Lookin' like you might need a little scenery change
Got a spot I've been hittin' since back in the day
What ya say we slip away and say the hell with this place?

[Chorus]
Go get a little gone girl on a black Jack label
In the middle of a dirt road dance floor
Way out, nobody in our business
Just us and the crickets and the good Lord
Stars gonna burn on out, moon gonna sneak on down
We could have a hell of a time, I'll get to makin' you mine
With the rest of what's left of the night, 'til it's gone girl

[Verse 2]
Gone like that six pack we gonna tip back on my hood
Gone like our Levis,  gonna hang 'em on an old dogwood
Yeah the thought of you and me in the back 40
With the trees and the bees and the birds
Can't think of nothin' better but baby no pressure
Really all you gotta do is say the word

[Chorus]
We can get a little gone girl on a black Jack label
In the middle of a dirt road dance floor
Way out, nobody in our business
Just us and the crickets and the good Lord
Stars gonna burn on out, moon gonna sneak on down
We could have a hell of a time, I'll get to makin' you mine
With the rest of what's left of the night, 'til it's gone girl
'Til it's gone girl

[Bridge]
So baby let's roll, take a few backroad curves
Roll 'til we find a little heaven on Earth

[Chorus]
Let's get a little gone girl on a black Jack label
In the middle of a dirt road dance floor
Way out, nobody in our business
Just us and the crickets and the good Lord
Stars gonna burn on out, moon gonna sneak on down
We could have a hell of a time, I'll get to makin' you mine
With the rest of what's left of the night, 'til it's gone girl
Take a few backroad curves, yeah 'til it's gone girl
Find a little heaven on Earth, 'til it's gone girl

[Verse 1]
She's my yin yang girl, she’s day she's night
Just a shot in the night, she's a beam of light
She’s a hot contradiction, a brand new addiction
Like to sip that wine when I take her out fishin'

[Verse 2]
She's the last one there when they close the bar
Got mud on the tires of her fancy car
She's a real good girl 'til she's had a few
Likes church on a Sunday, sits in the back pew
If the preacher only knew the man

[Chorus]
She's an angel who can raise a little hell
A drive fast, high class southern belle
She's crazy there ain’t no doubt about it
She’s a rock star dancin' on the tailgate
A little bit a sinner, and a little bit a saint
My yin yang girl
Yeah, she’s an angel who can raise a little hell

[Verse 3]
She's a daddy's little girl, she can do no wrong
But I hope he never sees her camera phone
She's a real home maker, a whiskey shot taker
A bed time story and a midnight shaker
Shake it babe

[Chorus]
And man, she’s an angel who can raise a little hell
A drive fast, high class southern belle
She's crazy there ain't no doubt about it
She's a rock star dancin' on the tailgate
A little bit a sinner, and a little bit a saint
She's my yin yang girl
Yeah, she's an angel who can raise a little hell

[Instrumental]

[Chorus]
She's an angel who can raise a little hell
A drive fast, high class southern belle
She's crazy there ain't no doubt about it
She's a rock star dancin' on the tailgate
A little bit a sinner, and a little bit a saint
She's my yin yang girl
Man, she's an angel who can raise a little hell
She's a rock star dancin' on the tailgate
A little bit of Skynyrd, and a little bit a Hank
She's crazy there ain't no doubt about it
She's crazy there ain't no doubt about it
She's my yin yang girl who can raise a little hell

[Outro]
Ahh, man
I think I got it bad for this one

[Verse 1]
The night is gettin' late, the crowd's headed home
It's just you and me girl on the lake shore
I know I just met you but I can't let you go
Forget about your friends, baby, I'll drive you home (Yeah)

[Verse 2]
I'll set you on the tailgate, we'll take it nice and slow
I know it ain't your stop, but I won't tell a soul, no

[Pre-Chorus]
I know you gotta wake up for that nine to five
But what's the point of livin', girl
If you don't feel alive?

[Chorus]
We can sleep when we're dead, the night is still young
Pour another drink, talk that song
'Bout small town lovers, hot summer nights
Midnight dancin' in the headlights
Some day we might regret leavin' that love out by the lake
If you're gettin' tired honey, we'll put that thought to bed
But we can sleep when we're dead

[Verse 3]
Put your pretty arms around me, now get in nice and close
Whisper in my ear what you'd like to know
Now you can tell me 'bout your family, or tell me 'bout your day
Or our lips can do the talking, let's listen baby, what do you say?

[Pre-Chorus]
I know it's kinda crazy for a Tuesday night
But sometimes a good thing don't need time

[Chorus]
We can sleep when we're dead, the night is still young
Pour another drink, talk that song
'Bout small town lovers, hot summer nights
Midnight dancin' in the headlights
Some day we might regret leavin' that love out by the lake
If you're gettin' tired honey, we'll put that thought to bed

[Bridge]
With a smile she pulled me to water
Them southern girls, man, they just don't get any hotter
I said "No girl, got on my good jeans"
She looked at me boy like "What do you mean?"

[Chorus]
We can sleep when we're dead, the night is still young
Jump on in, let's have a little fun
Small town lovers, hot summer nights
Out here swimmin' in the moonlight
Some day we might regret leavin' this love out by the lake
But no matter what you do, don't forget what we said
We can sleep when we're dead
We can sleep when we're dead, aww yeah
We can sleep when we're dead

[Intro]
Ahh yeah

[Verse 1]
There's some days that I wake up, can't remember where I am
Said some things, regret some things, but I really don't give a damn
Somewhere on this road I'm on I forgot what it's like to feel
I know I can't see heaven up there, but I know that it's real
And I ain't sure If I'll get in, but you best believe I'll try, yeah
And this is what my daddy told me, and this is how I live my life

[Chorus]
Got to take that ball cap off before you say grace
And always own up to your own mistakes
And don't you ever back down, no way no how
Got to make your daddy proud that he raised a man of the south
Yeah, that's what he did

[Verse 2]
I can't heal the broken hearts I left so far behind
On this road I have chose I lost all sense of time
So I drift into the night tryna drown away my sorrows
It might be wrong, but that's alright 'cause all the time is borrowed anyways

[Chorus]
Got to take that ball cap off before you say grace
And always own up to your own mistakes
And don't you ever back down, no way no how
Got to make your daddy proud that he raised a man of the south

[Bridge]
Some call me lost, some call me crazy
But that's okay
Think what you want, say what you will
But I've always kept it real
There's a cost for all these sins, and I'm bound to pay the price
Now this is what my daddy told me, and that's how I live my life

[Chorus]
Got to take that ball cap off, son, before you say grace
And always own up to your own mistakes
And don't you ever back down, no way no how
Got to make your daddy proud that he raised a man of the south
A man of the south
Ahh, take it away boys
Better take that ball cap off son

Duck me town

[Verse 1]
I’ve cussed on a Sunday
I’ve cheated and I’ve lied
I’ve fallen down from grace
A few too many times
But I find holy redemption
When I put this car in drive
Roll the windows down and turn up the dial

[Chorus]
Can I get a hallelujah?
Can I get an amen?
Feels like the Holy Ghost running through ya
When I play the highway FM
I find my soul revival
Singin' every single verse
Yeah, I guess that’s my church

[Verse 2]
When Hank brings the sermon
And Cash leads the choir
It gets my cold, cold heart burnin'
Hotter than a ring of fire
When this wonderful world gets heavy
And I need to find my escape
I just keep the wheels rolling, radio scrolling
Until my sins wash away

[Chorus]
Can I get a hallelujah?
Can I get an amen?
Feels like the Holy Ghost running through ya
When I play the highway FM
I find my soul revival
Singin' every single verse
Yeah, I guess that’s my church

[Chorus]
Can I get a hallelujah?
Can I get an amen?
Feels like the Holy Ghost running through ya
When I play the highway FM
I find my soul revival
Singin' every single verse
Yeah, I guess that’s my church

[Chorus]
Can I get a hallelujah?
Can I get an amen?
Feels like the Holy Ghost running through ya
When I play the highway FM
I find my soul revival
Singin' every single verse
Yeah, I guess that’s my church
Yeah, I guess that’s my church
Yeah, I guess that’s my church

[Intro]
La-a-a-a-a-di-da
La-a-a-a-a-di-da

[Verse 1]
If I had a dollar every time that I swore you off
And a twenty every time that i picked up when you called
And a crisp new Benjamin for when you're here then gone again
And a dollar every time I was right about you after all

[Chorus]
Boy, I'd be rich, head to toe Prada
Benz in the driveway, yacht in the water
Vegas at the Mandarin, high roller gambling
Me and Diddy drippin' diamonds like Marilyn
No, I wouldn't be drowning in all your IOUs
Every promise you made me would have some real value
'Cause all the little lies rolling off your lips
Is money falling from the sky... Shit, I'd be rich
La-a-a-a-a-di-da
I'd be rich
La-a-a-a-a-di-da

[Verse 2]
If I had a dime every time that you crossed my mind
Well, I'd basically be sitting on a big ass pile of dimes
And all the times that you make my heart feel cheap
I might as well have won the lottery
All of this pain and me cursing your name
Would just turn into dollar signs

[Chorus]
'Cause I'd be rich, head to toe Prada
Benz in the driveway, yacht in the water
Vegas at the Mandarin, high roller gambling
Me and Diddy drippin' diamonds like Marilyn
No, I wouldn't be drowning in all your IOUs
Every promise you made me would have some real value
'Cause all the little lies rolling off your lips
Is money falling from the sky... Shit, I'd be rich
La-a-a-a-a-di-da
I'd be rich
La-a-a-a-a-di-da

[Bridge]
Told myself I wouldn't do this again
But how much you wanna bet I'mma do this again?

[Chorus]
Rich, head to toe Prada
Benz in the driveway, yacht in the water
Vegas at the Mandarin, high roller gambling
Me and Diddy drippin' diamonds like Marilyn

No, I wouldn't be drowning in all your IOUs
Every promise you made me would have some real value
'Cause all the little lies rolling off your lips
Is money falling from the sky... Shit, I'd be rich
La-a-a-a-a-di-da
I'd be rich
La-a-a-a-a-di-da

[Outro]
I'd be rich
La-a-a-a-a-di-da
I'd be rich
La-a-a-a-a-di-da

[Verse 1]
Man, this shit's unflatterin', all up in my head again
I don't feel myself right now, maybe I should just lay down
If vanity's my vitamin, well, I don't feel the difference
I don't like myself right now, gotta find a way out

[Pre-Chorus 1]
What you feel is natural
But I don't wanna feel this anymore
Pick yourself up off the kitchen floor
What you waitin' for?

[Chorus 1]
Girl, won't you stop your cryin'?
I know that you're tryin'
Everything's gonna be okay
Baby girl, don't you hang your head low
Don't you lose your halo
Everyone's gonna be okay
Baby girl

[Verse 2]
Draw your comparisons, tryin' to find who's lesser than
I don't wanna wear your crown, there's enough to go around

[Pre-Chorus 2]
What you feel is natural (Natural)
You don't gotta put up with this anymore (Anymore)
Pick yourself up off the kitchen floor (Oh)
Tell me what you waitin' for?

[Chorus 1]
Girl, won't you stop your cryin'?
I know that you're tryin'
Everything's gonna be okay
Baby girl, don't you hang your head low
Don't you lose your halo
Everyone's gonna be okay
Baby girl

[Bridge]
Girl, don't hang your head low
Don't lose your halo, don't lose your halo
Girl, don't hang your head low
Don't lose your halo, oh

[Chorus 2]
Girl, won't you stop your cryin'?
I know that you're tryin'
Everything's gonna be okay
Baby girl, don't you hang your head low
Don't you lose your halo
Everyone's gonna be okay
Baby girl, won't you stop your cryin'? (Won't you stop your cryin'?)
I know that you're tryin'
Everything's gonna be okay (Everything's gonna be okay)
Baby girl, don't you hang your head low
Don't you lose your halo
Everyone's gonna be okay (Everyone's gonna be okay)
Baby girl

[Outro]
Everyone's gonna okay, baby
Mm mm mm, mm mm mm
Hoo hoo hoo, hoo

[Verse 1]
Still runs good, built to last
Moves like a hula girl on the dash
She ain't made for practicality
Yeah, I guess she's just like me

[Pre-Chorus 1]
It's Saturday night, about time to go
Got my white leather jacket and a neon soul
Once I turn on the radio, I'm ready to roll, r-ready to roll

[Chorus]
Feel like a hard-to-get starlet when I'm driving
Turning every head, hell, I ain't even trying
Got them Ray-Ban shades, pretty in pink
Call me old school, but hey
I'm a 90s baby in my 80s Mercedes
I'm a 90s baby in my 80s Mercedes

[Verse 2]
Pop the top down like a summer dream
She's my teenage time machine
Just keeps getting sweeter with age
She's classic through any decade

[Pre-Chorus 2]
The suns in the sky, glitter on the seats
You can try, but the Benz is hard to beat
So, hey, if you want you can ride with me, r-ride with me

[Chorus]
Feel like a hard-to-get starlet when I'm driving
Turning every head, hell, I ain't even trying
Got them Ray-Ban shades, pretty in pink
Call me old school, but hey
I'm a 90s baby in my 80s Mercedes
I'm a 90s baby in my 80s Mercedes

[Pre-Chorus 1]
It's Saturday night, about time to go
Got my white leather jacket and a neon soul
Once I turn on the radio, I'm ready to roll, r-ready to roll

[Chorus]
Feel like a hard-to-get starlet when I'm driving
Turning every head, hell, I ain't even trying
Got them Ray-Ban shades, pretty in pink
Call me old school, but hey
I'm a 90s baby in my 80s Mercedes
I'm a 90s baby in my 80s Mercedes

[Verse 1]
We're in the homestretch of the hard times
We took a hard left, but we're alright
Yeah, life sure can try to put love through it, but
We built this right, so nothing's ever gonna move it

[Chorus]
When the bones are good, the rest don't matter
Yeah, the paint could peel, the glass could shatter
Let it rain 'cause you and I remain the same
When there ain't a crack in the foundation
Baby, I know any storm we're facing
Will blow right over while we stay put
The house don't fall when the bones are good

[Verse 2]
Call it dumb luck, but baby, you and I
Can't even mess it up, yeah, though we both tried
No, it don't always go the way we planned it
But the wolves came and went and we're still standing

[Chorus]
When the bones are good, the rest don't matter
Yeah, the paint could peel, the glass could shatter
Let it rain 'cause you and I remain the same
When there ain't a crack in the foundation
Baby, I know any storm we're facing
Will blow right over while we stay put
The house don't fall when my bones are good
When the bones are good

[Bridge]
Bones are good, the rest, the rest don't matter (Baby, it don't really matter)
Paint could peel, the glass could shatter (Oh, the glass, oh, the glass could shatter)
Bones are good, the rest, the rest don't matter (Ooh)
Paint could peel, the glass, the glass could shatter (Yeah)

[Chorus]
When the bones are good, the rest don't matter
Yeah, the paint could peel, the glass could shatter
Let it rain (Let it rain, let it rain)
'Cause you and I remain the same (Woo)
When there ain't a crack in the foundation (Woo)
Baby, I know any storm we're facing
Will blow right over while we stay put
The house don't fall when the bones are good

[Outro]
Yeah, ooh

[Verse 1: Maren Morris]
Dear Hate
I saw you on the news today
Like a shock that takes my breath away
You fall like rain, cover us in drops of pain
I'm afraid that we just might drown

[Verse 2: Maren Morris]
Dear Hate
Well, you sure are colorblind
Your kiss is the cruelest kind
You could poison any mind
Just look at mine
Don't know how this world keeps spinning 'round and 'round

[Chorus: Maren Morris & Vince Gill]
You were there in the garden, like a snake in the grass
I see you in the morning staring through the looking glass
You whisper down through history and echo through these halls
But I hate to tell you, love's gonna conquer all

[Verse 3: Vince Gill]
Dear Hate
You were smiling from that Selma bridge
In Dallas, when that bullet hit and Jackie cried
You pulled those towers from the sky
But even on our darkest nights
The world keeps spinning 'round

[Chorus: Maren Morris & Vince Gill]
You were there in the garden, like a snake in the grass
I see you in the morning staring through the looking glass
You whisper down through history and echo through these halls
But I hate to tell you, love's gonna conquer all

[Bridge: Maren Morris]
Ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh

[Breakdown: Maren Morris]
Dear Love
Just when I think you've given up

[Chorus: Maren Morris & Vince Gill]
You were there in the garden when I ran from your voice
I hear you every morning through the chaos and the noise
You still whisper down through history and echo through these halls
And tell me love's gonna conquer all
Gonna conquer all

[Verse 1]
Darling, please, we were too gone to stay
Couldn't get through the night, so we had to call it a day
The words came out; they couldn't be erased
Saw the pain in your eyes, and I knew everything had changed

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm a traitor, I'm the cause
I'm the breaker of your heart
I ain't saying what you want
But baby, please, know that if

[Chorus]
Somehow we make it alive
And both get out on the other side
Oh, this might be asking a lot
When it's all said and done, don't forget that you loved me once

[Verse 2]
It's been months; I'm still seeing signs of you
Things that you wanted me to read, shit that you wanted me to do
If I'm left in the deepest part of your mind, it's cool
Oh, it's cool

[Pre-Chorus]
Yeah, it hurts, I agree
You're still the first part of me
I know I set you free
But baby, please, know that if

[Chorus]
Somehow we make it alive
And both get out on the other side
Oh, this might be asking a lot
When it's all said and done, don't forget that you loved me once

[Chorus]
Somehow we make it alive
And both get out on the other side
Oh, this might be asking a lot
When it's all said and done, don't forget that you loved me once
I know this might be asking a lot
When it's all said and done, don't forget that you loved me once

[Verse 1]
On paper we go together
I know that we look the part
But almost never hangs on forever
I know I'm breaking your heart

[Pre-Chorus 1]
So go on, say what you want to
I'm not gonna stop you
You can blame it all on me

[Chorus]
I'm not the hero in the story
I'm not the girl that gets the glory
'Cause you're looking for true love
And I'm not the one
But I wish, but I wish I was

[Verse 2]
Wish I could feel about you
The way you feel about me
But you can't make a heart say something
That it don't believe

[Pre-Chorus 2]
So go on, hate me if you have to
I hate myself too
'Cause as much as I want to be

[Chorus]
I'm not the hero in the story
I'm not the girl that gets the glory
'Cause you're looking for true love
And I'm not the one
But I wish, but I wish I was

[Pre-Chorus 3]
Go on, hate me if you have to
I still care about you
As much as I want to be

[Chorus]
I'm not the hero in the story
I'm not the girl that gets the glory
'Cause you're looking for true love
And I'm not the one
But I wish, but I wish I was

[Verse 1]
Usually a drink will do the trick
Take the edge off quick, sitting in the dark
With a shared cigarette
Seeing eye-to-eye, and heart-to-heart
But maybe I’m just getting old
Used to work, but now it don’t

[Verse 2]
A long gone drive
You know the kind where you take a turn
And you don’t know why
But it clears your mind, a surefire cure
I need something stronger
That’ll last a little longer

[Chorus]
I could use a love song
That takes me back, just like that
When it comes on
To a time when I wouldn’t roll my eyes
At a guy and a girl
Who make it work in a world
That for me so far just seems to go so wrong
Yeah, I could use, I could use a love song

[Verse 3]
I wish I didn’t know so much
I peeked behind the curtain
Now that magic rush
Feels like a trick that isn’t working
But I haven’t lost all hope yet
Yeah, it’s hurting, but it ain’t dead

[Chorus]
I could use a love song
That takes me back, just like that
When it comes on
To a time when I wouldn’t roll my eyes
At a guy and a girl
Who make it work in a world
That for me so far just seems to go so wrong
Yeah, I could use, I could use a love song

[Bridge]
Give me a sign or a rhyme or a reason
Just something that I can believe in

[Chorus]
I could use a love song
That takes me back, just like that
When it comes on
To a time when I wouldn’t roll my eyes
At a guy and a girl
Who make it work in a world
That for me so far just seems to go so wrong
Yeah, I could use
Yeah, I could use, I could use a love song

[Intro]
Heeeyy na na na na!
Heeeyy na na na na!

[Verse 1]
What you do with trash? You take it out
So why are you letting him hang around?
Girl, you gotta know when to clean house
And throw his shit out in the yard

[Verse 2]
If it was the first time, I would understand
But it's the third time - he got a second chance
There's a fine line between an accident
And an L-O-S-E-R

[Pre-Chorus]
It's bullshit, you know it
Yeah, I see it in your eyes
Every time that you tell me
Deep down he's a really good guy

[Chorus]
That's like saying
Drunk girls don't cry
Girl, you must be outta your
Damn mind

You say he saw the light, the slate is clean
He swears up and down that it's gonna be
Different this time
That's like saying drunk girls don't cry

La da di da da da da
La da di da da da da

[Verse 3]
Another weekend, another box of wine
I heard it so much I got it memorized
If you think he's the one then you must be blind
Or C-R-A-Z-Y

[Pre-Chorus]
C'mon, it's bullshit, you know it
I wish I had a dime for
Every time that you tell me
Deep down he's a really good guy

[Chorus]
That's like saying
Drunk girls don't cry
Girl, you must be outta your
Damn mind

You say he saw the light, the slate is clean
He swears up and down that it's gonna be
Different this time
That's like saying drunk girls don't cry

La da di da da da da
La da di da da da da

Heeeyy na na na na!
Heeeyy na na na na!

That's like saying
Drunk girls don't cry
Girl, you must be outta your
Damn mind

You say he saw the light, the slate is clean
He swears up and down that it's gonna be
Different this time
That's like saying drunk girls don't cry

La da di da da da da
La da di da da da da

Heeeyy na na na na!
Heeeyy na na na na!
Heeeyy na na na na!
Heeeyy na na na na!

[Verse 1]
First light, a sacrifice
Bird's eye, saw the signs
Cold nights will take your life
Reach out and touch your faith
Give up on everything
To carry the world on a string

[Pre-Chorus]
All you can give, all you can bear
All that you longed for, nothing compares
When nothing is sacred, no one is safe

[Chorus]
So you wanna play God? Come on
Is that all you got? Come on
Would you sell your soul? Burn it all
Everything that you love
Finally become second to none
In a kingdom of one

[Verse 2]
Dig down, far below
Lost souls feed the crows
Hell's fire keeps you warm

[Pre-Chorus]
All you can give, all you can bear
Look to your heart, but nothing is there
When nothing is sacred, no one is safe

[Chorus]
So you wanna play God? Come on
Is that all you got? Come on
Would you sell your soul? Burn it all
Everything that you love
Finally become second to none
In a kingdom of one
In a kingdom of one

[Bridge]
Come on
Come on
Come on
Come on

[Chorus]
So you wanna play God? Come on
Is that all you got? Come on
Would you sell your soul? Burn it all
Everything that you love
Ash to ash, dust to dust
Everything and God above
Shed a tear, shed your blood
No, you cannot give enough
Finally become second to none
In a kingdom of one

[Verse 1]
Well you really did it this time
Everyone watched as you took the stars right out of my sky
The light out of my eyes
I don’t need a drink or a good conversation
Or the talk of this town all around me
I’m broken, embarrassed, I know there’s nowhere I can go
All I know is that I need space

[Chorus]
If it takes a rocket, okay
Somewhere more than a planet away
I wave to the man in the moon
Put a lightyear between me and you
I need space

[Verse 2]
You really messed with my head
Knocked me off of my axis
I would get out of bed
But around here the fact is
No one who’s willing to listen will listen without taking sides of the story
Gravity’s holding me here but if I had a say all I’d say
Is that I need space

[Chorus]
If it takes a rocket, okay
Somewhere more than a planet away
I wave to the man in the moon
Put a lightyear between me and you
I need space

[Outro]
I wave to the man in the moon
Nowhere to be and nothing to do
With a lightyear between me and you
I need space
I need space
I need space

[Verse 1]
Smoke was coming off my jacket and you didn’t seem to mind
I left a long trail of ashes and you said, “I like your style”
Now, heartbreak ain’t a competition, but I took it in a landslide
The skeletons I wanted to bury, you liked out in the light

[Chorus]
You didn’t save me
You didn’t think I needed saving
You didn’t change me
You didn’t think I needed changing
My wings are frayed and what’s left of my halo’s black
Lucky for me, your kind of heaven’s been to Hell and back
To Hell and back

[Verse 2]
I wonder how you treasure what anyone would call a flaw
You say a pearl without the pressure wouldn’t be a pearl at all
When my demons come a-callin’, you don’t even bat an eye
I don’t scare you, and I guess that’s why

[Chorus]
You didn’t save me
You didn’t think I needed saving
You didn’t change me
You didn’t think I needed changing
My wings are frayed and what’s left of my halo’s black
Lucky for me, your kind of heaven’s been to Hell and back
To Hell and back

[Bridge]
Smoke was coming off my jacket
And I left a long trail of ashes

[Chorus]
You didn’t save me
You didn’t think I needed saving
You didn’t change me
You didn’t think I needed changing
My wings are frayed and what’s left of my halo’s black
Lucky for me, your kind of heaven’s been to Hell and back
Lucky for me, your kind of heaven’s been to Hell and back
To Hell and back
To Hell and back

[Verse 1]
Everyone's always talking 'bout
Their favorite destination
Where they're gonna go
On their next vacation
Gotta make that flashy reservation
Don't want to wait in line

But when I'm sitting on the couch
And I'm looking at the pictures
The background's only a secondary fixture
Where we went for dinner?
Shoot, I don't remember
But we had a good time

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Together, together
We can do whatever
Whatever

[Chorus]
We can walk right up the street
Where the locals roll
We ain't gotta go international
Baby, just drive in a park and party
We don't need no Hollywood suite

Ooh, don't matter what we do
Anything with you sounds fine to me
It's all about the company you keep
Yeah, 'bout the company you keep
So c'mon, keep me company
Ooh

[Verse 2]
Listen, when it comes down to it
Nobody really cares
Where you had your birthday
Just who was there
Buy you a shot, then hold back your hair
Take you to Waffle House

We're the circles that you're running
When you're running around
Bail you out, make you laugh
Pick you up when you're down
Hanging out in your hometown
Hey, that's what it's all about

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Whatever, whatever
We're all in it together
Birds of a feather

[Chorus]
We can walk right up the street
Where the locals roll
We ain't gotta go international
Baby, just drive in a park and party
We don't need no Hollywood suite

Ooh, don't matter what we do
Anything with you sounds fine to me
It's all about the company you keep
Yeah, 'bout the company you keep
So c'mon, keep me company

We can walk right up the street
Where the locals roll
We ain't gotta go international
Baby, just drive in a park and party
We don't need no Hollywood suite

Ooh, don't matter what we do
Anything with you sounds fine to me
It's all about the company you keep
Yeah, 'bout the company you keep
So c'mon, keep me company

[Outro]
Whatever, we're all in it together
So c'mon, keep me company

[Intro: Maren Morris]
Mmm, mmm
Mmm, mmm

[Verse 1: Maren Morris]
I've been tryna carry on
But I'm crushed under the weight
Of the world where I belong
But I don't feel at home, yeah
When it's over, when it's done
When we're standing at the gates
Will we see that all along, yeah
We're a different kind of same?

[Pre-Chorus: Maren Morris]
How do we get to the bottom of this
When we're sitting on the top?
Hey, the people, they tell me it's just how it is
Like it's never gonna stop

[Chorus: Maren Morris]
But we got way too much in common
So what's the point in fighting?
We got way too many problems if I'm being honest
I don't know what God is
'Cause we've got way too much in common (Mmm, mmm)
Way too much in common (Mmm, mmm)
Way too much in common

[Verse 2: Brandi Carlile]
I breathe it in my lungs
I've seen it in the flesh
If all we need is love
How the hell did we forget?

[Pre-Chorus: Brandi Carlile]
How do we get to the bottom of this
When we're sitting at the top?
People, they tell me it's just how it is
Like it's never gonna stop

[Chorus: Brandi Carlile, Maren Morris & Brandi Carlile]
Oh, we got way too much in common
So what's the point in fighting?
We got way too many problems if I'm being honest (Yeah)
I don't know what God is
Oh, we got way too much in common
Oh, maybe we forgot it (Maybe we forgot it)
With everybody talkin', ain't nobody listenin'
I don't know what God is
'Cause we got way too much in common

[Bridge: Brandi Carlile]
(Mmm, mmm)
(Mmm, mmm)
Ooh, ooh
(Mmm, mmm)
Ooh, ooh
(Mmm, mmm)

[Chorus: Maren Morris & Brandi Carlile, Brandi Carlile]
Oh, we got way too much in common
So what's the point in fighting? (What's the point in fighting?)
We got way too many problems if I'm being honest
I don't know what God is
'Cause we got way too much in common
(We got way too much in common)
Oh, but maybe we forgot it (Maybe we forgot it)
With everybody talkin' (With everybody talkin')
Ain't nobody listenin' (Ain't nobody listenin')
I don't know what God is
But we got way too much in common
Way too much in common
Oh, ain't nobody listenin'

[Verse 1]
I need to get more sleep
I been stayin’ up all night
Maybe when I drink, I need to stick to red wine
I need to pick up the phone
See what’s going on back home
Just admit, when I’m with him, I still feel alone

[Chorus]
I been going down a road
That’s a little too traveled
I should find the common thread
That makes it all unravel
Like laying down my dollar
Just for a temporary high
I gotta quit bummin’ cigarettes
From the wrong guys

[Verse 2]
I should slow this train
And take my own advice
Stop saying that some day, gonna make it right
It’s just a red light, it’s just a wrong turn
Another drag on a Friday night
It’s about time I learned

[Chorus]
I been going down a road
That’s a little too traveled
I should find the common thread
That makes it all unravel
Like laying down my dollar
Just for a temporary high
And I gotta quit bummin’ cigarettes
From the wrong guys

Oh

[Chorus]
I been going down a road
That’s a little too traveled
I should find the common thread
That makes it all unravel
Like laying down my dollar
Just for a temporary high
And I gotta quit bummin’ cigarettes
From the wrong guys

[Outro]
Stop laying down my heart
And find my own light
I got to quit bummin’ cigarettes
From the wrong guys

[Verse 1]
Boy I’ve been cooking up one hell of a crush
I’ve got you on my mind the minute I wake up
You make the morning glow, make the rooster crow, get my juices flowing
You know I got the spice but it ain’t enough

[Chorus]
Baby would you be my sugar, sugar?
Make my heart race, even on a good day
You make the world taste better, better
Good on anything, want you on everything
Just a little bit is all it takes
Like a Coca-Cola on a Christmas Day
You’re what I crave babe, what can I say?
Would you, would you
Would you be my sugar, sugar?

[Verse 2]
Tried the fake shit but it ain’t the same
A girl just knows when it’s the real thing
Yeah I’m a cup of tea with a touch of cream but something’s missing
So I’m gonna put this nice and sweet

[Chorus]
Baby would you be my sugar, sugar?
Make my heart race, even on a good day
You make the world taste better, better
Good on anything, want you on everything
Just a little bit is all it takes
Like a Coca-Cola on a Christmas Day
You’re what I crave babe, what can I say?
Would you, would you
Would you be my sugar, sugar?
Would you be my sugar, sugar?

[Bridge]
Sugar sugar, you make my heart race
Even on a good day you make the world taste
Better better, good on anything
Just a little bit is all that it takes

[Chorus]
Sugar, sugar
Make my heart race, even on a good day
You make the world taste better, better
Good on anything, want you on everything
Just a little bit is all it takes
Like a Coca-Cola on a Christmas Day
You’re what I crave babe, what can I say?
Would you, would you
Would you be my sugar, sugar?
Would you be my sugar, sugar?
Yeah

[Verse 1: Maren Morris]
Not everybody drinks on a Tuesday night
Mixes their liquor with Crystal Light
With a couple of friends they called out of the blue
And not everybody spends what they made that week
On a tank of gas and a little bit of weed
But all my favorite people do

[Chorus: Maren Morris]
I don't know about them, but I know about us
It is what it is and we love who we love
Not everybody gets what we’re going through
But all my favorite people do
Yeah, all my favorite people do

[Post-Chorus: Maren Morris]
Come on, TJ

[Verse 2: TJ Osborne]
Not everybody's gonna find clarity
In a back porch sittin' kind of therapy
With a little bit of wine, John Prine, and Camel Blues
Not everybody leaves well enough alone
Stays out of business that ain’t their own
But all my favorite people do

[Chorus: Maren Morris]
I don't know about them, but I know about us
It is what it is and we love who we love
Not everybody gets what we're going through
But all my favorite people do
Yeah, all my favorite people do

[Bridge: Maren Morris]
All my favorite people, all my favorite people
All my favorite people, yeah, they do
Yeah, we ain't all perfect, but we're doing alright
Everybody's worried 'bout tryin' to get by
But all my favorite people do

[Chorus: Maren Morris]
Well, I don’t know about them, but I know about us
It is what it is and we love who we love
Not everybody gets what we’re going through
But all my favorite people do
Yeah, all my favorite people do

[Verse 1]
What's your time machine?
Is it Springsteen or "Teenage Dream"?
What's your takes-you-back?
Your first falling-in-love soundtrack?

[Pre-Chorus]
When you were looking for the words
Somebody said it first so you didn't have to
It was looking right at you

[Chorus]
One danced you through love
One rocked you through lonely
Mixtaped your heartbreak and made you feel holy
For the hits and the misses, for the fire and rain
Close your eyes and listen
'Cause there's a song for everything, yeah
There's a song for everything

[Verse 2]
My first lighter up
Was back when Coldplay still played clubs
My first real goodbye
Damn, that second verse still makes me cry

[Pre-Chorus]
When I was looking for the words
Somebody said it first like they knew me
They were singing right to me

[Chorus]
One danced you through love
One rocked you through lonely
Mixtaped your heartbreak and made you feel holy
For the hits and the misses, for the fire and rain
Close your eyes and listen
'Cause there's a song for everything, yeah
There's a song for everything
There's a song for everything

[Bridge]
What's your time machine?
Is it Springsteen or "Teenage Dream"?

[Chorus]
One danced you through love
One rocked you through lonely
Mixtaped your heartbreak and made you feel holy
For the hits and the misses, for the fire and rain
Close your eyes and listen
'Cause there's a song for everything, hey
There's a song for everything, yeah

[Outro]
There's a song for everything
Ooh

[Verse 1]
Why do we build up all these idols
Just to watch 'em fall?
You're wearin' the crown, toast of the town
And no one takes your call

[Bridge]
Yeah maybe I've been down, down, down, down
But I always come back around, 'round, 'round, 'round

[Chorus]
You can't forget about me
While you weren't lookin' I was gettin' even higher
Say what you want about me
Your words are gasoline on my fire
You can hate me, underestimate me
Do what you do cause what you do don't phase me
Just when you think I'm at the end
Any second I'ma catch my second wind

[Verse 2]
An airplane's only paper 'til it finds a breeze
But don't you know that it's the low that makes the high so sweet?
When they try to break, break, break you
That's when you get your break, break, breakthrough

[Chorus]
You can't forget about me
While you weren't lookin' I was gettin' even higher
Say what you want about me
Your words are gasoline on my fire
You can hate me, underestimate me
Do what you do cause what you do don't phase me
Just when you think I'm at the end
Any second I'ma catch my second wind

[Bridge]
Yeah maybe I've been down, down, down, down
But I always come back around, 'round, 'round, 'round

[Chorus]
You can't forget about me
While you weren't lookin' I was gettin' even higher
Say what you want about me
Your words are gasoline on my fire
You can hate me, underestimate me
Do what you do cause what you do don't phase me
Just when you think I'm at the end
Any second I'ma catch my second wind

[Intro]
This is the end of Side One of this record
Please now turn it over for the second side

[Verse 1]
I got a phone that won't die
You're up in the air, landing tonight
So I'll leave a message for ya, get it when you touch down
If I'm being honest, I'm a little drunk now
I got a bed that's too big without ya
I got a heart that don't beat without ya
Get so jealous when you ain't by my side
I know it's selfish, but I need you tonight

[Chorus]
So text when you touch down, straight to my place now
These nights without you, they're so hard to sleep
Come put your things down, I'll order take out
No more to say now, baby, just make out with me
Baby, just make out with me

[Verse 2]
You got a kiss I still taste
And I feel your lips from miles away
I got one more minute of this message to burn
I hope you get it 'cause I mean every word

[Chorus]
So text when you touch down, straight to my place now
These nights without you, they're so hard to sleep
Come put your things down, I'll order take out
No more to say now, baby, just make out with me
Baby, just make out with me
Just like it used to be, baby, just make out with me

[Verse 1]
I know that you always brought it but you never brought it back to you
Threw yourself in the hands of somebody who wasn’t gonna come through
And it’s always a shame watching you ache from the same wound
You don’t have to walk through the fire to know that I want you

[Chorus]
We can start with the touch of a hand like a movie scene
Moving into the weight that you’ve been wanting to put on me
There is no need to be nervous, I know you been looking for love, so
Let me show you how it’s done
Yeah, I can show you how it’s done

[Verse 2]
Ain’t like this is foreign territory for you ‘cause it’s crossed your mind
I’ve been patiently waiting for the right time for a long time
But with the way you’re looking at me, I can’t complain, so baby keep trying
Do whatever you want as long as you’re gonna cross that line

[Chorus]
We can start with the touch of a hand like a movie scene
Moving into the weight that you’ve been wanting to put on me
There is no need to be nervous, I know you been looking for love, so
Let me show you how it’s done
Yeah, I can show you how it’s done

[Bridge]
I’ll take your hand and your heart wherever
Baby let me do it ‘cause you know I know you better
Let me show you how, let me show you how
Let me show you how, let me show you how
It ain’t fair what she’s been givin'
Now I’m on a mission for what you’ve been missin'
Let me show you how, let me show you how
Let me show you how

[Chorus]
We can start with the touch of a hand like a movie scene
Moving into the weight that you’ve been wanting to put on me
There is no need to be nervous, I know you been looking for love, so
Let me show you how it’s done
Yeah, I can show you how it’s done
Let me show you how it’s done

[Verse 1]
When you were young, there were some things
You had planned out, a map of your dreams
If some pull through, and if some fall away
I promise to you, this one's gonna stay

[Pre-Chorus]
I'll sway like a tree when you need a change
I'll travel the world or stay in one place
I'll hold your hand when the storm's at the door
'Cause you got my back and I got yours

[Chorus]
You've got the love of a good woman
Yeah, you've got the love of a good woman

[Verse 2]
If you need my arms to hold you together
They'll be right here to hold you forever
Sometimes we won't know the road that we'll face
But we'll get where we're going even if we're late

[Pre-Chorus]
I'll sway like a tree when you need a change
No one'll speak the language we made
I'll hold your hand when the storm's at the door
'Cause you got my back and I got yours

[Chorus]
You've got the love of a good woman
Yeah, you've got the love of a good woman

[Bridge]
I'll keep you warm beneath the sheets
The weight of the world's got nothing on me

[Chorus]
'Cause you've got the love of a good woman
Yeah, you've got the love of a good woman
I'll sway like a tree when you need a change
We'll travel the world or stay in one place
You've got the love of a good woman
Yeah, you've got the love of a good woman

[Verse 1]
I ought to know better
But you know that never stopped me before
Yeah, my wheels just have a way of spinning
Always ending back at your door
So add your name to the list
Of all the things I can’t seem to kick

[Chorus]
You’re just another mess
Another late night call I shouldn’t be making
Just another high
Another one night shot I shouldn’t be chasing
I got my excuses, no I don’t know why I do it, but
You’re just another, just another thing I shouldn’t be doing
Hell, I shouldn’t be doing

[Verse 2]
Just like smoking, just like drinking
I’m a fool for ever thinking I’m done
Yeah, I always break that promise
If I’m honest, it ain’t ever just one
Or two, when I’m running into you
I’m right back on that road
Pushing that first domino

[Chorus]
You’re just another mess
Another late night call I shouldn’t be making
Just another high
Another one night shot I shouldn’t be chasing
I got my excuses, no I don’t know why I do it, but
You’re just another, just another thing I shouldn’t be doing
I shouldn’t be doing

[Chorus]
Yeah, you’re just another kiss
Another Friday night I shouldn’t be wasting
Just another “What you doing later on?” I shouldn’t be saying
I got my excuses, no I don’t know why I do it, but
You’re just another, just another thing I shouldn’t be doing
I shouldn’t be doing
Shouldn’t be doing, shouldn’t be doing

[Verse 1]
Before you found me
Baby, my heart and all around me was like a graveyard
I didn't sleep alone, but never felt more lonely
I tried for so long to get it right, but
You get it so wrong until the right love
Makes you realize that there's a one and only

[Chorus]
You just fell out of the sky
The best things come when you don't even try
Lightning in a bottle doesn't happen twice
The kind of gospel that saves you just in time
The myth of me and you is fiction turned to truth
Most loves don't make it through, but the great ones do
But the great ones, yeah, the great ones, yeah, the great ones do
But the great ones, the great ones do

[Verse 2]
It's like every single star aligning
We traded silver for gold lining
You're the perfect storm, so let it pour down on me
If they tell the story in a hundred years
No one would believe that you and me were really here
Just a memory of what the real thing can be

[Chorus]
You just fell out of the sky
The best things come when you don't even try
Lightning in a bottle doesn't happen twice
The kind of gospel that saves you just in time
The myth of me and you is fiction turned to truth
Most loves don't make it through, but the great ones do
But the great ones, yeah, the great ones, yeah, the great ones do
But the great ones, the great ones do

[Bridge]
You know when you know and I know you do
And I know that I just love you
Sometimes it feels just too good to be true, but it's true
Yeah, somehow it's true that

[Chorus]
You just fell out of the sky
The best things come when you don't even try
Lightning in a bottle doesn't happen twice
The kind of gospel that saves you just in time
The myth of me and you is fiction turned to truth
Most loves don't make it through, but the great ones do
But the great ones, the great ones, yeah, the great ones do
But the great ones, the great ones do

[Outro]
You know when you know
You know when you know
Ooh

[Verse 1]
From the second that we walk in
You kinda make me wanna leave
You let your eyes do the talking
It kinda makes me wanna be
Alone with you, home with you
Little love drunk stoned with you
I need a minute 'cause, boy, you're giving me the

[Chorus]
Feels
Like the tickle of the bubbles in a bottle of cheap champagne
And it feels like I’m gettin' into trouble, but I’m gonna do it anyway
And it feels like love in the morning
So good it’s gonna burn through my body all day
What can I say? Hey
You’re giving me the feels, baby
Head down to my heels, baby

[Verse 2]
You don't gotta light a candle
You don’t have to set the mood
What you gotta understand, though
I’m already into you
It’s chemistry, meant to be
Incomprehensibly, tangled up in it
Yeah, boy, you're giving me the

[Chorus]
Feels
Like the tickle of the bubbles in a bottle of cheap champagne
And it feels like I’m gettin' into trouble, but I’m gonna do it anyway
And it feels like love in the morning
So good it’s gonna burn through my body all day
What can I say? Hey
You’re giving me the feels, baby
Head down to my heels, baby

[Bridge]
I need a, I need a minute
I’m tangled in it
I’m kinda, I’m kinda caught up
You give me all the
I need a, I need a minute
I’m tangled in it
I’m kinda, I’m kinda, caught up
You give me all the

[Chorus]
Feels (Yeah yeah)
Like the tickle of the bubbles in a bottle of cheap champagne
And it feels like I’m gettin' into trouble, but I’m gonna do it anyway
And it feels like love in the morning
So good, it’s gonna burn through my body all day (All day)
Oh, what can I say? Hey
You’re giving me the feels, baby (Ooh)
Head down to my heels, baby (Oh)
You’re giving me the feels, baby
Head down to my heels, baby
You're giving me the feels

[Verse 1]
Baby, I was way past the point of saving
But you didn't try to save me, you just let it be
Called me up, "Say, let's go get a drink"
We don't even have to say a thing

[Pre-Chorus]
But we talked a while 'bout our dreams
Our lives, our saints
How you like to hear me sing

[Chorus]
I guess I always knew there was something more to you
If my stars burn out of light, if my diamond loses shine
Your gold love gets me through
Gets me through, gets me through

[Verse 2]
Fascinated by the facets of me I hated
The beauty that I kept shaded
You brought the sun around
Said I'm too good to be on the ground
You wanna hold me, but you'll never hold me down

[Pre-Chorus]
Yeah, you saw the hurt through the pain
Saw the sparks through the rain
After that drink, I never was the same

[Chorus]
I guess I always knew
There was something more to you
If my stars burn out of light, if my diamond loses shine
Your gold love gets me through
Gets me through, gets me through
I guess I always knew
There was something more to you
If my stars burn out of light, if my diamond loses shine
Your gold love gets me through
Gets me through, gets me through

[Bridge]
Yeah, I guess I always knew
There was something more to you
Silver lining just won't do
Your gold love will get me through
Yeah, I guess I always knew
There was something more to you
Silver lining just won't do
Your gold love will get me through

[Chorus]
I guess I always knew
There was something more to you
If my stars burn out of light, if my diamond loses shine
Your gold love gets me through
Gets me through, gets me through
I guess I always knew
(Yeah, I guess I always knew
There was something more to you)
There was something more to you
(Silver lining just won't do
Your gold love will get me through)
If my stars burn out of light, if my diamond loses shine
(Yeah, I guess I always knew
There was something more to you)
Your gold love gets me through
Gets me through, gets me through
(Silver lining just won't do
Your gold love will get me through)

[Verse 1]
Ain't water down my words or sugar up my spice
Sometimes the truth don't always come out nice
Just gonna do me and you don't have to listen
And if you don't like the heat, then get out of the kitchen

[Chorus]
I'm cookin' up my own flavor
Even if it ain't your style
You only see one layer
Original could take a while
Making a mess, straight out of scratch
Think what you think about that
Oh, I'm just trying to make good a little bit greater
I'm cookin' up my own flavor
I'm cookin' up my own flavor

[Verse 2]
If it ain't familiar, it's 'cause you ain't had it yet
Even if you don't like it, I bet you won't forget
There's always one or two pushing on the envelope
So I'ma raise a glass to you if you're one of those

[Chorus]
I'm cookin' up my own flavor
Even if it ain't your style
You only see one layer
Original could take a while
Making a mess, straight out of scratch
Think what you think about that
Oh, I'm just trying to make good a little bit greater
I'm cookin' up my own flavor
I'm cookin' up my own flavor

[Bridge]
Yeah, I'm a lady, I make my dough
Won't play the victim, don't fit that mold
I speak my peace, don't do what I'm told
Shut up and sing? Well, hell no, I won't

[Chorus]
I'm cookin' up my own flavor
Even if it ain't your style
You only see one layer
Original could take a while
Making a mess, straight out of scratch
Think what you think about that (What you think about that)
Oh, I'm just trying to make good a little bit greater
I'm cookin' up my own flavor (Hey)
Oh, I'm cookin' up my own flavor

[Outro]
Ah yeah
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
One layer, one layer

[Verse 1]
Don't tell me that you got better plans
For those velvet hands, they’re in demand
Don't tell me that you're not a little curious
Don’t be so serious, it can be only us

[Pre-Chorus]
If you want more than your eyes on me, yeah
You can let me know privately

[Chorus]
RSVP
Bring your love to me, yeah
It's an open invitation to an all-night situation
If I'm where you wanna be
RSVP
I'm a fun party, yeah
All you gots to bring your loving
'Cause I ain't wearing nothing
Nothing you can't take off me
RSVP

[Verse 2]
I'm a glass of good whiskey with your name on it
Looking for your lips and your fingerprints
This floor is waiting for my black dress to fall
Somewhere in the hall, so don’t take too long

[Pre-Chorus]
Watch the sweat fall like confetti, yeah
Wake up in my big Cali king

[Chorus]
RSVP
Bring your love to me, yeah
It’s an open invitation to an all-night situation

[Outro]
RSVP
So come on, don't be late, baby, baby

[Verse 1]
I was mixed up in the shadows casting over me
Blending in the background of someone else's dream
Then I caught your light, then I caught your glow
Didn’t dim my shine, but you changed my tone
Now I'm illuminated and you're all I see

[Chorus]
Baby, baby, you’re my color, custom made
Think I finally discovered you're my perfect shade

[Verse 2]
I stand out like neon on the darkest night
Everything looks clearer looking in your eyes
It could be the fall, it could the spring
Baby, you look good with everything
I've tried other designs, and boy, you fit just right

[Chorus]
Baby, baby, you're my color, custom made
Think I finally discovered you're my perfect shade

[Bridge]
Shades of green, shades of gold
I don't need another rainbow
Shades of me, shades of you
You're the prism that I see through

[Chorus]
Baby, baby, you're my color, custom made
Think I finally discovered you’re my perfect shade

[Outro]
You’re my perfect shade, yeah
Hey yeah
Hey, hey, hey yeah
Whoa oh oh oh, whoa, mmm

[Verse 1]
Now I know
"Spanish Harlem" are not just pretty words to say
I thought I knew
But now I know that rose trees never grow in New York City

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Until you've seen this trash-can dream come true
You stand at the edge while people run you through
And I thank the Lord there's people out there like you
I thank the Lord there's people out there like you

[Chorus]
While Mona Lisas and mad hatters
Sons of bankers, sons of lawyers
Turn around and say good morning to the night
For unless they see the sky
But they can't and that is why
They know not if it's dark outside or light

[Verse 2]
This Broadway's got
It's got a lot of songs to sing
If I knew the tunes, I might join in
I go my way alone
Grow my own, my own seeds shall be sown
In New York City

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Subway's no way for a good man to go down
Rich man can ride and the hobo, he could drown
And I thank the Lord for the people I have found
I thank the Lord for the people I have found, yeah

[Chorus]
While Mona Lisas and mad hatters
Sons of bankers, sons of lawyers
Turn around and say good morning to the night
For unless they see the sky
But they can't and that is why
They know not if it's dark outside or light

[Verse 3]
And now I know
"Spanish Harlem" are not just pretty words to say
I thought I knew
But now I know that rose trees never grow in New York City

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Subway's no way for a good man to go down
Rich man can ride and the hobo, he can drown
And I thank the Lord for the people I have found
I thank the Lord for the people I have found, yeah

[Chorus 3]
While Mona Lisas and mad hatters
Sons of bankers, sons of lawyers
Turn around and say good morning to the night
For unless they see the sky
But they can't and that is why
They know not if it's dark outside or light

[Outro]
They know not if it's dark outside or light

[Verse 1]
We're in the homestretch of the hard times
We took a hard left, but we're alright
Yeah, life sure can try to put love through it, but
We built this right, so nothing's ever gonna move it

[Chorus]
When the bones are good, the rest don't matter
Yeah, the paint could peel, the glass could shatter
Let it rain 'cause you and I remain the same
When there ain't a crack in the foundation
Baby, I know any storm we're facing
Will blow right over while we stay put
The house don't fall when the bones are good (Mmm)

[Verse 2]
Well, call it dumb luck, but baby, you and I
Can't even mess it up, although we both try
No, it don't always go the way we planned it
But the wolves came and went and we're still standing

[Chorus]
When the bones are good, the rest don't matter
Yeah, the paint could peel, the glass could shatter
Let it rain 'cause you and I remain the same
When there ain't a crack in the foundation
Baby, I know any storm we're facing
Will blow right over while we stay put
The house don't fall when my bones are good
When the bones are good
Mmm, when the bones are good

[Bridge]
Bones are good, the rest, baby, it don't matter
Paint could peel, the glass
Oh, the glass, oh, the glass could shatter
Bones are good, the rest, the rest don't matter
Paint could peel, the glass, the glass could shatter

[Chorus]
When the bones are good, the rest don't matter
Yeah, the paint could peel, the glass could shatter
Let it rain 'cause you and I remain the same
When there ain't a crack in the foundation
Baby, I know any storm we're facing
Will blow right over while we stay put
The house don't fall when the bones are good

[Verse 1]
Take a seat
Right over there, sat on the stairs
Stay or leave
The cabinets are bare, and I'm unaware
Of just how we got into this mess, got so aggressive
I know we meant all good intentions

[Pre-Chorus]
So pull me closer
Why don't you pull me close?
Why don't you come on over?
I can't just let you go

[Chorus]
Oh baby, why don't you just meet me in the middle?
I'm losing my mind just a little
So why don't you just meet me in the middle?
In the middle
Oh baby, why don't you just meet me in the middle?
I'm losing my mind just a little
So why don't you just meet me in the middle?
In the middle

[Verse 2]
Oh, take a step
Back for a minute, into the kitchen
Floors are wet
And taps are still running, dishes are broken
How did we get into this mess? Got so aggressive
I know we meant all good intentions

[Pre-Chorus]
So pull me closer
Why don't you pull me close?
Why don't you come on over?
I can't just let you go

[Chorus]
Oh baby, why don't you just meet me in the middle?
I'm losing my mind just a little
So why don't you just meet me in the middle?
In the middle

[Bridge]
Looking at you, I can't lie
Just pouring out admission
Regardless of my objection, oh, oh
And it's not about my pride
I need you on my skin
Just come over, pull me in, just

[Chorus]
Oh, baby, why don't you just meet me in the middle?
I'm losing my mind just a little
So why don't you just meet me in the middle?
In the middle, no no
Baby, why don't you just meet me in the middle?
Oh yeah, I'm losing my mind just a little
So why don't you just meet me in the middle?
Oh, in the middle
Oh baby, why don't you just meet me in the middle, baby?
I'm losing my mind just a little
So why don't you just meet me in the middle, middle?
In the middle, middle

[Verse 1]
Man, this shit's unflatterin', all up in my head again
Well, I don't feel myself right now, maybe I should just lay down
If vanity's my vitamin, well, I don't feel the difference
I don't like myself right now, gotta find a way out

[Pre-Chorus]
What you feel is natural
But I don't wanna feel this anymore
Pick yourself up off the kitchen floor
What you waitin' for?

[Chorus]
Girl, won't you stop your cryin'?
I know that you're tryin'
Everything's gonna be okay
Baby girl, don't you hang your head low
Don't you lose your halo
Everyone's gonna be okay
Baby girl

[Verse 2]
Well, drawing your comparisons, tryin' to find who's lesser than
I don't wanna wear your crown, there's enough to go around

[Pre-Chorus]
What you feel is natural
You don't gotta put up with this anymore
Pick yourself up off the kitchen floor
Tell me what you waitin' for?

[Chorus]
Girl, won't you stop your cryin'?
I know that you're tryin'
Everything's gonna be okay
Baby girl, don't you hang your head low
Don't you lose your halo
Everyone's gonna be okay
Baby girl

[Bridge]
Girl, don't hang your head low
Don't lose your halo, don't lose your halo
Girl, don't hang your head low
Don't lose your halo, oh

[Chorus]
Girl, won't you stop your cryin'?
I know that you're tryin'
Everything's gonna be okay
Baby girl, don't you hang your head low
Don't you lose your halo
Everyone's gonna be o-, everyone's gonna be okay

[Outro]
Everyone, everyone, everyone's gonna be okay
Mmm

[Verse 1]
Like a rainy Sunday mornin'
Makes me wanna stay in bed twisted up all day long
You're my inspiration, girl
You take me places, put the words right into these songs

[Bridge]
Stealin' kisses under cover, babe
See forever when I see your face
And I swear God made you for me

[Chorus]
You make it easy lovin' up on you
Make it easy with every little thing you do
You're my sunshine in the darkest days
My better half, my savin' grace
You make me who I wanna be
You make it easy

[Verse 2]
You took all my rough around the edges
Never let it ruffle up your feathers, angel
Yeah, I'm down for life, you got me wrapped around your finger
And I like it just in case you can't tell

[Chorus]
You make it easy lovin' up on you
Make it easy with every little thing you do
You're my sunshine in the darkest days
My better half, my savin' grace
You make me who I wanna be
You make it easy

[Bridge]
Stealin' kisses under cover, babe
See forever when I see your face
And I swear God made you for me

[Chorus]
You make it easy lovin' up on you
Make it easy with every little thing you do
You're my sunshine in the darkest days
My better half, my savin' grace
You make me who I wanna be
You make it easy
You make it easy

[Verse 1]
She had a shiny little Beamer with the ragtop down
Sittin' in the drive but she wouldn't get out
The dogs were all barkin' and a-waggin' around
And I just laughed and said "Y'all get in"

[Verse 2]
She had on a new dress and she'd curled her hair
She was lookin' too good not to go somewhere
Said what you want to do, baby, I don't care
We can go to the show, or we can stay right here

[Chorus]
And I can take you for a ride on my big green tractor
We can go slow or make it go faster
Down through the woods and out to the pasture
Long as I'm with you it really don't matter
Climb up in my lap and drive if you want to
Girl, you know you got me to hold on to
We can go to town but baby, if you'd rather
I'll take you for a ride on my big green tractor

[Verse 3]
Said we can fire it up and I can show you around
Sit up on the hill and watch the sun go down
When the fireflies are dancin' and the moon comes out
We can turn on the lights and head back to the house

[Chorus]
Or we can take another ride on my big green tractor
We can go slow or make it go faster
Down through the woods and out to the pasture
Long as I'm with you it really don't matter
Climb up in my lap and drive if you want to
Girl you know you got me to hold on to
We can go to town but, baby, if you'd rather
I'll take you for a ride on my big green tractor

[Bridge]
Just let me dust off the seat
Put your pretty little arms around me, hell yeah

[Guitar Solo]

[Chorus]
You can climb up in my lap and drive if you want to
Girl you know you got me to hold on to
We can go to town or baby if you'd rather
I'll take you for a ride on my big green tractor

[Outro]
Oh, yeah
We can go to town
Or we can go another round
On my big green tractor

[Chorus]
Yeah I'm chillin' on a dirt road
Laid back swervin' like I'm George Jones
Smoke rollin' out the window
An ice cold beer sittin' in the console
Memory lane up in the headlights
It's got me reminiscin' on them good times
I'm turning off of real life drivin', that's right
I'm hittin' easy street on mud tires

[Verse 1]
Back in the day Pott's farm was the place to go
Load the truck up, hit the dirt road
Jump the barbwire, spread the word
Light the bonfire, then call the girls
The king in the can and the Marlboro man
Jack 'n' Jim were a few good men
Where ya learned how to kiss and cuss and fight too
Better watch out for the boys in blue
And all this small town he said, she said
Ain't it funny how rumors spread
Like I know something y'all don't know
Man that talk is getting old
Ya better mind your business, man, watch your mouth
Before I have to knock that loud mouth out
I'm tired of talkin', man, y'all ain't listening
Them old dirt roads is what y'all missing

[Chorus]
Yeah I'm chillin' on a dirt road
Laid back swervin' like I'm George Jones
Smoke rollin' out the window
An ice cold beer sittin' in the console
Memory lane up in the headlights
It's got me reminiscin' on them good times
I'm turning off of real life drivin', that's right
I'm hittin' easy street on mud tires

[Verse 2]
I sit back and think about them good ol' days
The way we were raised and our southern ways
And we like cornbread and biscuits
And if it's broke round here we fix it
I can take y'all where you need to go
Down to my hood, back in them woods
We do it different 'round here, that's right
But we sure do it good and we do it all night
See, if you really wanna know how it feels
To get off the road with trucks and four wheels
Jump on in, and man, tell your friends
We'll raise some hell where the blacktop ends

[Chorus]
Chillin' on a dirt road
Laid back swervin' like I'm George Jones
Smoke rollin' out the window
An ice cold beer sittin' in the console
Memory lane up in the headlights
It's got me reminiscin' on them good times
I'm turning off of real life drivin', that's right
I'm hittin' easy street on mud tires
Let's ride

Yeah, I'm chillin' on a dirt road
Laid back swervin' like I'm George Jones
Smoke rollin' out the window
An ice cold beer sittin' in the console
Memory lane up in the headlights
It's got me reminiscin' on them good times
I'm turning off of real life drivin', that's right
I'm hittin' easy street on mud tires
That's right

[Verse 1]
Love how you close your eyes when I pull you in closer
Tonight's moving fast but we ain't taking it slower
You hit me harder than a drink does
You're gonna take me all the way up
Something about you baby, got me going crazy
I don't know what to do

[Chorus]
I've never met a girl like you
That's ever done it quite like you do
Your kiss is double-barrel bourbon on rocks
Your lips are just the cherry on top
I've never been high like this
Turn out the lights and let me breathe you in
Your eyes are so diamond, body so gold
And I don't want to let you go
I've never met a girl like you

[Verse 2]
Love how you say my name and make it sound so sexy
Love how you do that thing, yeah you know what gets me
I'm talking slow motion all night long
Baby, love you with the lights on

[Chorus]
I've never met a girl like you
That's ever done it quite like you do
Your kiss is double-barrel bourbon on rocks
Your lips are just the cherry on top
I've never been high like this
Turn out the lights and let me breathe you in
Your eyes are so diamond, body so gold
And I don't want to let you go
I've never met a girl like you

[Chorus]
I've never met a girl like you
That's ever done it quite like you do
Your kiss is double-barrel bourbon on rocks
Your lips are just the cherry on top
I've never been high like this
Turn out the lights and let me breathe you in
Your eyes are so diamond, body so gold
And I don't want to let you go
I've never met a girl like you
I've never met a girl like you

[Verse 1: Jason Aldean]
All the folks down in Lynchburg, Tennessee
Been working hard for good ol' boys like me
I don't wanna be the one to tell 'em
That stuff that they've been selling
Ain't working like it should
But I damn sure wish it would

[Chorus: Jason Aldean & Miranda Lambert]
Whiskey's supposed to drown the memory
I've gone from one to one too many
And the thing that really gets me
Is how your memory drowns the whiskey

[Verse 2: Jason Aldean & Miranda Lambert]
Maybe it's the bar or the stool I'm on
Maybe it's the band and the sad old song
That keeps me buying rounds
That keeps me turning down
Any girl that wants to dance
And you ain't giving them a chance

[Chorus: Jason Aldean & Miranda Lambert]
Whiskey's supposed to drown the memory
I've gone from one to one too many
And the thing that really gets me
Is how your memory drowns the whiskey

[Bridge: Jason Aldean & Miranda Lambert]
Girl, I'm living proof that 80 proof
Ain't got a shot at touching you

[Chorus: Jason Aldean & Miranda Lambert]
But whiskey's supposed to drown the memory
I've gone from one to one too many
And the thing that really gets me
Is whiskey's supposed to drown the memory
I've gone from one to one too many
And the thing that really gets me
Is how your memory drowns the whiskey
Yeah the thing that really gets me
Is how your memory drowns the whiskey

[Outro: Jason Aldean & Miranda Lambert]
All the folks down in Lynchburg, Tennessee
Been working hard for good old boys like me

[Verse 1]
You slip your finger through the tear in my t-shirt
You stirrin' up dirty in the back of my mind
You keep on flirtin', 'cause you know that it's workin'
You stuck in my head girl writing the lines
Couldn't sing this song without you if I tried
Let's light it up like it's our last night

[Chorus]
We're just hanging around
Burnin' it down
Sippin' on some cold Jack Daniel's
Jammin' to some old Alabama with you baby
Laying right here naked in my bed
I'm just doing my thing
You love it when I sing
Say it makes you feel like an angel
We about to get a little tangled up right about now
So girl let's keep burnin' it down
Burnin' it down, burnin' it down

[Verse 2]
Girl when you want it
You know that I'm on it
You know that I love lovin' up on you
Let's hit the switch and let our shadows dance
And light it up like it's our last chance

[Chorus]
We're just hanging around
Burnin' it down
Sippin' on some cold Jack Daniel's
Jammin' to some old Alabama with you baby
Laying right here dreamin' in my bed
I'm just doing my thing
You love it when I sing
Say it makes you feel like an angel
We about to get a little tangled up right about now
So girl let's keep burnin' it down
Burnin' it down, burnin' it down, burnin' it down
Burnin' it down, burnin' it down, burnin' it down

[Bridge]
I wanna rock it all night
Baby girl will you rock it out with me (with me)
I wanna crawl through the dark
Just to feel your heartbeat against me (against me)
I wanna rock it all night
Baby girl will you rock it out with me (with me)
I wanna crawl through the dark
Just to feel your heartbeat against me  (against me)

[Chorus]
We're just hanging around
Burnin' it down
Sippin' on some cold Jack Daniel's
Jammin' to some old Alabama with you baby
Laying right here naked in my bed
I'm just doing my thing
You love it when I sing
Say it makes you feel like an angel
We about to get a little tangled up right about now
So girl let's keep burnin' it down
Burnin' it down, burnin' it down, burnin' it down
Burnin' it down, burnin' it down, burnin' it down

[Outro]
I wanna rock it all night
Baby girl will you rock it out with me (with me)
I wanna crawl through the dark
Just to feel your heartbeat against me

[Verse 1]
Wiped the footprints off my dash
Tore up those sun-faded photographs
Threw 'em in the wind, ya'll can have it back
I'm outta here
I stuck my middle finger up in the sky
Flipped off that "ya'll come back" sign
Looked in the mirror one last time
And watched it disappear

[Chorus]
It ain't nothin' but a rearview town
Broken hearts and rusted plows
Roots ripped right up out of the ground
Never thought I'd ever leave it
It ain't nothin' what it used to be
Population minus me
On the other side of that dust cloud
Ain't nothin' but a rearview town

[Verse 2]
I could tough it out, but what's the use?
A place that small, it's hard to do
Too much of her to run into
And so much road to somewhere new

[Chorus]
It ain't nothin' but a rearview town
Broken hearts and rusted plows
Roots ripped right up out of the ground
Never thought I'd ever leave it
It ain't nothin' what it used to be
Population minus me
On the other side of that dust cloud
Ain't nothin' but a rearview town

[Bridge]
It ain't nothin' but yesterday
One less truck rollin' down Main
Ain't nothin' left to say

[Chorus]
It ain't nothin' what it used to be
Population minus me
On the other side of that dust cloud
Ain't nothin' but a rearview town

[Outro]
Ain't nothin' but a rearview town

[Verse 1]
I guess you heard I was pedal to the metal on a downhill slide
Girl, you know those rumors get to flyin' in a town this size
No, I didn't feel a thing when you threw that ring and slammed the door
If you wanna know the truth you gotta go straight to the source

[Chorus]
Ask any ol' barstool in this town
Ask my new found party crowd
Sure I take more Jack in my Coke now
A little more high in my smoke now
Sure I stay 'til they're all long gone
And I take the long way home
But I ain't sittin' 'round
Tryin' to drown
The thought of you
Ask any ol' barstool

[Verse 2]
I can finally stretch out in our king size bed if I make it that far
But fillin' in all these blanks you left isn't all that hard
No, I ain't wonderin' where you been or who you been with
I guess you didn't hurt me half as bad as you think you did

[Chorus]
Ask any ol' barstool in this town
Ask my new found party crowd
Sure I take more Jack in my Coke now
A little more high in my smoke now
Sure I stay 'til they're all long gone
And I take the long way home
But I ain't sittin' 'round
Tryin' to drown
The thought of you
Ask any ol' barstool

[Bridge]
Yeah, you think I'm down and out, hidin' out, hell-bent crazy
But that ain't me, baby

[Chorus]
Ask any ol' barstool in this town
Ask my new found party crowd
Sure I take more Jack in my Coke now
But I'm a long way from broke down
Sure I stay 'til they're all long gone
And I take the long way home
But I ain't sittin' 'round
Tryin' to drown
The thought of you
Ask any ol' barstool
Ask any ol' barstool

[Outro]
I guess you heard I was pedal to the metal on a downhill slide

[Verse 1]
Tell 'em all I'm on vacation
Say I went to visit friends
That you ain't heard or seen from me in quite a while
When they ask you where I've been
Tell 'em I'm out on the West Coast
Where it don't ever rain
And that I'm probably doing fine

[Chorus]
Just don't tell 'em I've gone crazy
That I'm still strung out over you
Tell 'em anything you want to
Just don't tell 'em all the truth
Yeah, don't tell 'em all the truth

[Verse 2]
Tell 'em all I'm out in Vegas
Blowing every dollar I ever made
Tell 'em that I must be into something bad for me
'Cause I sure lost a lot of weight
Tell 'em I'm out on the road
With some old rock and roll band
Living like a gypsy can

[Chorus]
Just don't tell 'em I've gone crazy
That I'm still strung out over you
Tell 'em anything you want to
Just don't tell 'em all the truth
Yeah, don't tell 'em all the truth

[Bridge]
The truth is that I'm asking you to lie
And we both know that it ain't right
But if you ever loved me
Please have some mercy on me
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Chorus]
Tell 'em anything you want to
Just don't tell 'em all the truth
Yeah, don't tell 'em all the truth
I still need you

[Outro]
Yeah, that's the truth
I still love you
Baby, that's the truth

[Intro]
You boys ever met a real country girl
Talkin', true blue, out in the woods, down home, country girl

[Verse 1]
She's a hot little number in her pickup truck
Daddy's sweet money done jacked it up
She's a party all nighter from South Carolina
A bad mamajama from down in Alabama
She's a ragin' cajun, a lunatic from Brunswick
Juicy Georgia peach with a thick southern drawl
Sexy swing and walk, brother, she's all

[Chorus]
Country (shoot)
From her cowboy boots to her down home roots
She's country
From the songs she plays to the prayers she prays
That's the way she was born and raised
She ain’t afraid to stay
Country
Brother, she's country

[Verse 2]
A hell raisin' sugar when the sun goes down
Mama taught her how to rip up the town
Honey drippin' honey from the holler in Kentucky
Get you flippin', kinda trippy like a Mississippi hippie
She's a Kansas princess
Crazy mother trucker, undercover lover
Thick southern drawl, sexy swing and walk
Brother, she's all

[Chorus]
Country, (shoot)
From her cowboy boots to her down home roots
She's country
From the songs she plays to the prayers she prays
That's the way she was born and raised
She ain’t afraid to stay
Country
Nothin' but country

[Bridge]
(Thick southern drawl)
(Sexy swing and walk)
(Aw, show 'em how a country girl does it one time now)

[Interlude]

[Chorus]
Brother, she's country
From her cowboy boots to her down home roots
Nothin' but country
Yeah, yeah-ah
She's country (shoot)
From her cowboy boots to her down home roots
She's country
From the songs she plays to the prayers she prays
That's the way she was born and raised
She ain't afraid to stay
Country
Yeah, she's nothin' but country

[Outro]
She's all about the country
From the backwoods, she's a homegrown, down to the bone
She's country

[Verse 1]
These fields don't grow overnight, this town wasn't built in a day
I'll be turnin' that dirt when the sun comes up
Goin' round in circles while that plane you're on takes you away
Chasin' down that sun in L.A, 2000 miles it ain't that far
Girl, wherever you are

[Chorus]
I'll wait for you, I'll wait for you
Find your way back, I'll pray you do
I'll wait for you
The August rain, the break of dawn
Like anything worth countin' on
Comin' through, I'll wait for you

[Verse 2]
I'll keep the light on on the porch, I'll keep the key under the mat
Just in case I'm out there somewhere tryin' not to lose my mind
When you come back I know you gotta go
And if you don't girl you'll never know
And if you can't find what you want out there
I'll be right here, ain't goin' nowhere

[Chorus]
I'll wait for you, I'll wait for you
Find your way back, I'll pray you do
I'll wait for you
The August rain, the break of dawn
Like anything worth countin' on
Comin' through, I'll wait for you
Oh I'll wait for you

[Bridge]
These fields don't grow overnight
This town wasn't built in a day
Some things you love are worth the wait
Worth the wait

[Chorus]
I'll wait for you, I'll wait for you
Find your way back, I'll pray you do
I'll wait for you
The August rain, the break of dawn
Like anything worth countin' on
Comin' through, I'll wait for you
Oh I'll wait for you
I'll wait for you
Oh I'll wait for you
I'll wait for you

[Verse 1]
I'm about sick and tired of this bar crowd
I’ll throw some money down if you want to slip out
You’ve got me locked in, take my hand
Come be my queen, sitting up in my King Ranch
Bet you’d look good on a two lane back road
Bare feet on the dash, hand out the window

[Chorus]
I want to ride all night, you sitting to my right
Till we get tomorrow shining in the headlights
I want to show you around this little farm town
Find some places that we can’t be found, girl
Just wanna take my time, just you and me baby
I wanna ride all night

[Verse 2]
If this keeps going good
I’m gonna make a little stop down by the creek
Lay you down in my truck bed
Steal another kiss before we drive off
I don’t know what you did but I’m already gone

[Chorus]
I want to ride all night, you sitting to my right
Till we get tomorrow shining in the headlights
I want to show you around this little farm town
Find some places that we can’t be found, girl
Just wanna take my time, just you and me baby
I wanna ride all night

[Bridge]
Bet you’d look good on a two lane back road
Bare feet on the dash, hand out the window

[Chorus]
I wanna ride all night, you sitting to my right
Till we get tomorrow shining in the headlights
I want to show you around this little farm town
Find some places that we can’t be found, girl
Just wanna take my time, just you and me baby
I wanna ride all night
I wanna ride all night
I wanna ride all night

[Verse 1]
They boarding up this water town
Ain't nobody hanging 'round
Another grey September day
Was I crazy to think she'd stay

[Chorus]
If that sun would have just hung up in that sky
Just a little bit, yeah, just a little bit longer
If those blue water waves
Could've stayed at our feet on the beach
'Stead of going out with the tide
If that wind was a friend
It'd still be blowing in, like a warm southern whisper on her (on her)
She might have stayed forever and never ever left these arms
If only I, had a little more summertime

[Verse 2]
I brace myself against the cold
And let her memory take hold
Stirring that old fire up
As if I don't miss her enough

[Chorus]
If that sun would have just hung up in that sky
Just a little bit, yeah, just a little bit longer (longer)
If those blue water waves
Could've stayed at our feet on the beach
'Stead of going out with the tide
If that wind was a friend
It'd still be blowing in, like a warm southern whisper on her (on her)
She might have stayed forever and never ever left these arms
If only I, had a little more summertime
Just a little more summertime

If that sun would have just hung up in that sky
Just a little bit, yeah, just a little bit longer (longer)
She might have stayed forever and never ever left these arms
If only I, had a little more summertime

[Verse 1]
I ain't gonna lie, girl
I know sometimes I can be crazy
But I can see it in your eyes
I'm the only guy that's driving you wild, so wild
Call it what you wanna but you know I wanna call you my lady
All this on and off and on again
And I wish you would make up your mind
'Cause it's time

[Chorus]
And I'm tired of playing these games
Yeah you say that it's over
And then you tell me come over
It's like fire, and then it's like rain
Yeah we're hot and we're colder
You get me drunk and then sober
Tell me it's on if you want it to be
If you're moving on, then I think you should leave
I'm tired of playing these games, so I won't
Baby, love me or don't

[Verse 2]
I could keep your little red dress that you left on the floor, girl
Hang it in the closet 'cause I know you're gonna want it next time, next time
You can come here and kiss me or walk out the door
I can hold you for good girl, or not anymore

[Chorus]
I'm tired of playing these games
Yeah you say that it's over
And then you tell me come over
It's like fire, and then it's like rain
Yeah we're hot and we're colder
You get me drunk and then sober
Tell me it's on if you want it to be
If you're moving on, then I think you should leave
I'm tired of playing these games, so I won't
Baby, love me or don't

[Bridge]
You can love me if you want to
You can hate me if you don't
You can come here and kiss me or walk out the door
I can hold you for good girl, or not anymore

[Chorus]
'Cause I'm tired of playing these games
Yeah you say that it's over
And then you tell me come over
It's like fire, and then it's like rain
Yeah we're hot and we're colder
You get me drunk and then sober
Tell me it's on if you want it to be
If you're moving on, then I think you should leave
I'm tired of playing these games, so I won't
Baby, love me or don't

[Outro]
Yeah baby, love me or don't
Baby, love me or don't

[Verse 1]
I've been thinking 'bout you all day, baby
Waiting on that sun to go down
Whatcha say I pick you up after work
Slide over, we slip out to the outskirts of town

[Verse 2]
I got a blanket and a fifth of Comfort
A little something to knock off the edge
It’s supposed to get a little cool tonight
Looks like I’m going to have to hold you tight, yeah

[Chorus]
About a mile off Old Mill Road
In that spot nobody knows
We park the truck and we take off running
Hurry up, girl I hear it coming
Got a moon and a billion stars
The sound of steel and old box cars
The thought of you is driving me insane
Come on baby, let’s go listen to the night train

[Verse 3]
Yeah, I hope it’s gonna be a long one
And if we’re lucky, it’s moving slow
I wouldn’t mind if it lasted all night
Lying next to you on that hillside
Let’s go

[Chorus]
About a mile off Old Mill Road
In that spot nobody knows
We park the truck and we take off running
Hurry up, girl I hear it coming
Got a moon and a billion stars
The sound of steel and old box cars
The thought of you is driving me insane
Come on baby, let’s go listen to the night train
Let’s go listen to the night train

About a mile off Old Mill Road
That spot nobody knows
We park the truck and we take off running
Hurry up, girl I hear it coming
Got a moon and a billion stars
The sound of steel and old box cars
The thought of you is driving me insane
Come on baby, let’s go listen to the night train
Let’s go listen to the night train

[Verse 1]
You're a crack of dawn, Monday morning, coffee strong
Poured everything you got into a paycheck Friday night
You're a Powerstroke diesel, backhoe riding king of beers, 18-wheeler driving, living life in between the lines
Of clocking in and quitting time

[Pre-Chorus]
But then the six string circus comes to town
We hang them speakers over the crowd

[Chorus]
When the lights come on, everybody's screaming
Lighters in the sky, yeah, everybody's singing
Every word to every song to the girl they're taking home tonight
When the lights come on, everybody's feeling
A hallelujah high from the floor to the ceiling
Yeah, the drink that we're drinking, the smoke that we're smoking
The party we throw, it's going all night long
When the lights come on
When the lights come on

[Verse 2]
You're a little shy thing with a wild side
On a night like this, you just can't hide
'Cause it's time to live it up
So come on and raise your cup

[Pre-Chorus]
If we're talking 'bout memories, yeah, we're gonna make 'em
Talking 'bout rules, you know we're gonna break 'em

[Chorus]
When the lights come on, everybody's screaming
Lighters in the sky, yeah, everybody's singing
Every word to every song to the girl they're taking home tonight
When the lights come on, everybody's feeling
A hallelujah high from the floor to the ceiling
Yeah, the drink that we're drinking, the smoke that we're smoking
The party we throw, it's going all night long
When the lights come on
When the lights come on

[Bridge]
Yeah, we all the same 'cause we thinking the same thing
(Yeah, we all the same 'cause we thinking the same thing)
We on the same page 'cause we sipping the same drink
(We on the same page 'cause we sipping the same drink)
Here's a little something to thank y'all for showing up
Aldean and the boys about to blow it up, haha

[Chorus]
When the lights come on, and everybody's screaming
Lighters in the sky, yeah, everybody's singing
Every word to every song to the girl they're taking home tonight
When the lights come on, everybody's feeling
A hallelujah high from the floor to the ceiling
Yeah, the drink that we're drinking, the smoke that we're smoking
The party we throw, it's going all night long
When the lights come on
When the lights come on
Your boy's blowing it up
It's going all night long
When the lights come on

[Verse 1]
It's 3 AM and I finally say
I'm sorry for actin' that way
I didn't really mean to make you cry
Oh, baby, sometimes I wonder why

[Chorus]
Does it always have to come down to you leavin'
Before I'll say "I love you"?
Why do I always use the words that cut the deepest
When I know how much it hurts you?
Oh, baby, why do I do that to you?

[Verse 2]
I know I'd never let you walk away
So why do I push you 'til you break?
And why are you always on the verge of goodbye
Before I'll show you how I really feel inside?

[Chorus]
Why does it always have to come down to you leavin'
Before I'll say "I love you"?
And why do I always use the words that cut the deepest
When I know how much it hurts you?
Oh, baby, why do I do that to you?
Why do I do that to you?

[Interlude]

[Outro]
Why do I always use the words that cut the deepest
When I know how much it hurts you?
Oh, baby, why do I do that to you?
Why do I do that to you?
Why do I do that to you?

[Verse 1]
Well you never liked them much
But I broke out these old boots again
Gonna jump in that old truck
Head down to the bar and hang out with an old friend
Been a while since I fired up a cigarette
And got drunk on some draft beer
Well where I’m going tonight
There’s a good chance you won’t want me back here
I tried to be what you were looking for
But I can’t do that anymore

[Chorus]
I'm better at being who I am
Better at letting my rebel run
And nothing about me worth a damn
If I can’t be my old man’s son
Your world and mine are worlds apart
This 'square peg, round hole' thing's too hard
Being something that ain't never had a chance
I’m better at being who I am

[Verse 2]
I wasn’t ever gonna change
I don’t know who in the hell I thought I was kiddin’
For a little while there it seemed like the sex would make it all alright but it didn’t
This ain’t my side of the tracks
I got good at forgetting that

[Chorus 2]
I’m better at being who I am
Better at letting my rebel run
Ain’t nothing about me worth a damn
If I can’t be my old man’s son
Your world and mine are worlds apart
This 'square peg, round hole' thing's too hard
Being something I ain’t never had a chance
I’m better at being back on my side of town
Back down to earth
A blue jean boy and a flannel shirt
I’m just not what you deserve
For what it’s worth, for what it’s worth

[Chorus]
I'm better at being who I am
Better at being where I'm from
Ain't nothing about me is worth a damn
If I can’t be my old man’s son
Your world and mine are worlds apart
This 'square peg, round hole' thing's too hard
Being something I ain't never had a chance
I’m better at being who I am

[Verse 1]
I worked all week
Cleaned up clean cut and clean shaved
I got the cover off the '68
I fire it up and let them horses sing
A little pretty thing
A little tan-legged Georgia dream
She’s a rocking them holey jeans
Baby what you got going on Saturday?
You know words got it there’s gonna be a party
Out of town about half a mile
Four wheel drives and big mud tires
Muscadine wine

[Chorus]
Oh baby you can find me
In the back of a jacked up tailgate
Sitting round watching all these pretty things
Get down in that Georgia clay
And I’ll find peace
At the bottom of a real tall cold drink
I'm chilling to some Skynyrd and some old Hank
Let's get this thing started
It’s my kinda party

[Verse 2]
If you wanna drink
Go baby just do your thing
Give up your keys
Hell why drive when you can stay with me?
And then after while we’ll sneak away from the bonfire
Walk by the moonlight and down to the riverside
Gotcha sipping on some moonshine
Baby if you're in the mood you can settle for a one night rodeo
You can be my tan-legged Juliet
I’ll be your Redneck Romeo

[Chorus]
Oh baby you can find me
In the back of a jacked up tailgate
Sitting round watching all these pretty things
Get down in that Georgia clay
And I’ll find peace
At the bottom of a real tall cold drink
I'm chilling to some Skynyrd and some old Hank
Let's get this thing started
It’s my kinda party

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
Oh baby you can find me
In the back of a jacked up tailgate
Sitting round watching all these pretty things
Get down in that Georgia clay
And I’ll find peace
At the bottom of a real tall cold drink
I'm chilling to some Skynyrd and some old Hank
Let's get this thing started
It’s my kinda party

[Outro]
Y'all ready for this?
Y'all gonna turn it on up

[Verse 1: Jason Aldean]
Well, I grew up in one of them old farm towns
Where they hit it hard 'til the sun goes down
Nobody really seemed to care
That we were living in the middle of nowhere
We just figured that’s how it was
And everybody else was just like us
Soaking in the rain, baking in the sun
Don’t quit 'til the job gets done

[Chorus]
That’s the only way I know
Don’t stop 'til everything’s gone
Straight ahead, never turn around
Don’t back up, don’t back down
A full throttle, wide open
You get tired and you don’t show it
Dig a little deeper when you think you can’t dig no more
That’s the only way I know

[Verse 2: Luke Bryan & Jason Aldean]
That old red dirt, the first thing you learn
Is you don’t get nothing that you don’t earn
Humble pride I grew up on
You find out just how bad you want it
The sun in our eyes and backs to the fences
We didn’t know the odds were against us
Hit the wall smoking and spinning
Still wasn’t thinking ‘bout nothing but winning

[Chorus]
That’s the only way I know
Don’t stop 'til everything’s gone
Straight ahead, never turn around
Don’t back up, don’t back down
A full throttle, wide open
You get tired and you don’t show it
Dig a little deeper when you think you can’t dig no more
That’s the only way I know

[Bridge: Eric Church]
Maybe there’s another path that
Will get you there a little bit faster
But I’m sticking with the one inside of me

[Chorus]
That’s the only way I know
Don’t stop 'til everything’s gone
Straight ahead, never turn around
Don’t back up, don’t back down
A full throttle, wide open
You get tired and you don’t show it
Dig a little deeper when you think you can’t dig no more
That's the only way I

That’s the only way I know
But don’t stop 'til everything’s gone
Straight ahead, never turn around
Don’t back up, don’t back down
A full throttle, wide open
You get tired and you don’t show it
Dig a little deeper when you think you can’t dig no more
That's the only way I know

[Outro]
That's the only way I know
That's the only way I know
The only way I know
Now get on it one time

[Verse 1: Jason Aldean]
I really hate to let this moment go
Touchin' your skin, and your hair fallin' slow
When a goodbye kiss, feels like this

[Chorus: Jason Aldean & Kelly Clarkson]
Don't you wanna stay here a little while?
Don't you wanna hold each other tight?
Don't you wanna fall asleep with me tonight?
Don't you wanna stay here a little while?
We can make forever feel this way
Don't you wanna stay?

[Verse 2: Kelly Clarkson]
Let's take it slow, I don't wanna move too fast
I don't wanna just make love, I wanna make love last
When you're up this high, it's a sad goodbye

[Chorus: Jason Aldean & Kelly Clarkson]
Don't you wanna stay here a little while?
Don't you wanna hold each other tight?
Don't you wanna fall asleep with me tonight?
Don't you wanna stay here a little while?
We can make forever feel this way
Don't you wanna stay?

[Bridge: Jason Aldean, Kelly Clarkson, Both]
Oh, yeah
Oh, you feel so perfect, baby
Yeah, you feel so perfect, baby
Don't you wanna stay here a little while?

[Chorus: Jason Aldean & Kelly Clarkson]
Don't you wanna stay here a little while?
Don't you wanna hold each other tight?
Don't you wanna fall asleep with me tonight?
Don't you wanna stay here a little while?
We can make forever feel this way
Don't you wanna stay?

[Outro: Kelly Clarkson with Jason Aldean]
Don't you wanna stay?
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse 1]
A couple of guys in first class on a flight
From New York to Los Angeles
Kinda making small talk killing time
Flirting with the flight attendants
Thirty-thousand feet above, could be Oklahoma

[Verse 2]
Just a bunch of square cornfields and wheat farms
Man, it all looks the same
Miles and miles of back roads and highways
Connecting little towns with funny names
Who'd want to live down there in the middle of nowhere?

[Verse 3]
They've never drove through Indiana
Met the men who plowed that earth
Planted that seed, busted his ass for you and me
Or caught a harvest moon in Kansas
They'd understand why God made
Those flyover states

[Verse 4]
I bet that mile long Santa Fe freight train engineer's seen it all
Just like that flatbed cowboy stacking US steel on a 3-day haul
Roads and rails under their feet
Yeah that sounds like a first class seat

[Verse 5]
On the plains of Oklahoma
With a windshield sunset in your eyes
Like a water-colored painted sky

You'll think heaven's doors have opened
You'll understand why God made
Those flyover states

[Verse 6]
Take a ride across the badlands
Feel that freedom on your face
Breathe in all that open space
And meet a girl from Amarillo
You'll understand why God made
You might even wanna plant your stakes
In those flyover states
(Yeah)

[Outro]
Have you ever been through Indiana?
On the plains of Oklahoma?
Take a ride

[Verse 1]
Some days it's tough just getting up
Throwing on these boots and making that climb
Some days I would rather be a no show or lay low
'Fore I go out of my mind

[Chorus]
But when she says baby (baby)
Oh, no matter what comes, ain't going nowhere
She runs her fingers through my hair and saves me (saves me)
Yeah, that look in her eye's got me coming alive
And driving me a good kind of crazy
When she says baby
Oh, when she says baby

[Verse 2]
Some nights I come home fighting mad
Feel like running my fist through the wall
Is it even worth what I'm fighting for anymore
Feeling torn, aw, to hell with it all

[Chorus]
But when she says baby (baby)
Oh, no matter what comes, ain't going nowhere
She runs her fingers through my hair and saves me (saves me)
Yeah, that look in her eye's got me coming alive
And driving me a good kind of crazy
When she says baby

[Bridge]
Everything gonna be alright
Just lay down by my side
Let me love you through this life

[Verse 3]
Yeah, she's a perfect shot of faith
When every bit of mine is gone
Something I can believe in, a best friend
A heaven sent love to lean on

[Chorus]
But when she says baby (baby)
Oh, no matter what comes, ain't going nowhere
She runs her fingers through my hair and saves me (saves me)
Yeah, that look in her eye's got me coming alive
And driving me a good kind of crazy
When she says baby
Oh, when she says baby

[Outro]
Yeah, that look in her eye's got me coming alive
And driving me a good kind of crazy

[Verse 1]
They call us a two lane just passing by slow down town
Yeah they say what's there to do when you ain't got nothin' around
Just a few street lights, speed limit signs that all say 25
But those folks ain't lived in our lives

[Chorus]
They ain't seen the blood sweat and tears
It took to live their dreams
When everything's on the line
Ain't just another field, just another farm
Naw, it's the ground we grew up on
They think it's a middle of nowhere place where we take it slow
Aw, but they don't know

[Verse 2]
All they see is tractors, barbwire and tall green grass
Naw they don't see the years spent working, busting their ass
How they pray for rain
They don't know a thing
About what it takes
Livin' this way

[Chorus]
They ain't seen the blood sweat and tears
It took to live their dreams
When everything's on the line
Ain't just another field, just another farm
Naw, it's the ground we grew up on
They think it's a middle of nowhere place where we take it slow
Aw, but they don't know
No, they don't know

[Bridge]
They call us a two lane just passing by slow down town
Yeah they say what's there to do when you ain't got nothin' around

[Chorus]
They ain't seen the blood sweat and tears
It took to live their dreams
When everything's on the line
Ain't just another field, just another farm
Naw, it's the ground we grew up on
They think it's a middle of nowhere place where we take it slow
Aw, but they don't know
No, they don't know

[Verse 1]
Got a warm breeze blowing, cool creek flowing
Full moon high, got a good thing going
Got some old school tracks tweaking on the speakers
What we got between us is burning like a fever
It’s a damn good night, firefly light, bourbon on ice
Just waiting on you and I to

[Chorus]
Set it off, set if off
A little kiss is all it takes, all it takes to get me lit
And I’ll be like a bottle rocket flying
Every move striking like lighting
That 5 alarm touch in your fingertips
Turns an ordinary night into a night like this
Let’s set it off, set it off
Set it off

[Verse 2]
We were hanging on 8, now we’re tipping on 10
You turn it up a little then you turn it up again
The curves on you got my body on cruise
You’re 90 proof smooth but girl them baby blues really

[Chorus]
Set it off, set if off
A little kiss is all it takes, all it takes to get me lit
And I’ll be like a bottle rocket flying
Every move striking like lighting
That 5 alarm touch in your fingertips
Turns an ordinary night into a night like this
Let’s set it off, set it off
Set it off

[Bridge]
On your mark, get set, go
Give the stars a little rock show
Set fire to this back road
Make midnight into smoke

[Chorus]
Set it off, set if off
A little kiss is all it takes, all it takes to get me lit
And I’ll be like a bottle rocket flying
Every move striking like lighting
That 5 alarm touch in your fingertips
Turns an ordinary night into a night like this
Let’s set it off, set it off
Set it off

[Outro]
Set it off
Yeah girl, set it off

[Intro]
Oh, you like the way that sounds?

[Verse 1]
Little Jimmy Jackson is jackinl up his Bronco
He's gonna lay a little rubber later on at the truck pull
And all the girls are gettin' pretty, they're sprayin' on the White Rain
Yeah, they're gonna get a rowdy tonight down at the football game

[Chorus]
Yeah, we let it rip
When we got the money, let it roll
If we got the gas it gets wild
Yeah, but that's the way we get down
In a hicktown

[Verse 2]
Well, you can see the neighbors butt crack nailin' on his shingles
And his woman smokin' Pall Malls watchin' Laura Ingalls
And Granny's gettin' lit, she's headin' out to bingo
Yeah, my buddies and me are goin' muddin' down on Blue Hole Road

You know, you know

[Chorus]
Yeah, we let it rip
When we got the money, let it roll
If we got the gas it gets wild
Yeah, but that's the way we get down
In a hicktown

[Interlude]
Oh, stand on it

[Verse 3]
We hear folks in the city party in Martini Bars
And they like to show off in their fancy foreign cars
Out here in the boondocks we buy beer at Amoco
And crank our Kraco speakers with that country radio

[Chorus]
We let it rip
When we got the money, let it roll
If we got the gas it gets wild
Yeah, but that's the way we get down
In a hicktown

Oh, oh

[Chorus]
Yeah, we let it rip
When we got the money, let it roll
If we got the gas it's buckwild
Yeah, but that's the way we get down
In a hicktown
In a hicktown
Yeah, it's the way we get down
Yeah, in hicktown
Yeah, in hicktown

Aw, we ain't finished yet

[Outro]
Got your country boys and your redneck girls
It's the party heard 'round the world
Right here in hicktown
In hicktown
The whole town's gettin' down

[Chorus]
Yeah, we let it rip
When we got the money, let it roll
If we got the gas it's buckwild
Yeah, but that's the way we get down
In a hicktown
In a hicktown
Yeah, it's the way we get down
Yeah, in hicktown
Yeah, in hicktown

[album version]
We ain't finished yet

Got your redneck boys and your redneck girls
Down here in hicktown

[Verse 1]
He gets up before the dawn
Packs a lunch and a thermos full of coffee
It's another day in the dusty haze
Those burnin' rays are wearin' down his body
The diesel's worth the price of gold
It's the cheapest grain he's ever sold
But he's still holdin' on

[Chorus]
He just takes the tractor another round
And pulls the plow across the ground
And sends up another prayer
He says, "Lord, I never complain, I never ask 'Why?'
Please don't let my dreams run dry
Underneath, underneath this Amarillo Sky"

[Verse 2]
That hail storm back in '83
Sure did take a toll on his family
But he stayed strong and carried on
Just like his Dad and Granddad did before him
On his knees every night
He prays, "Please let my crops and children grow"
'Cause that's all he is ever known

[Chorus]
He just takes the tractor another round
And pulls the plow across the ground
And sends up another prayer
He says, "Lord, I never complain, I never ask 'Why?'
Please don't let my dreams run dry
Underneath, underneath this Amarillo Sky"

[Interlude]

[Chorus]
And he takes the tractor another round. (Another round)
Another round (Another round), another round
And he takes the tractor another round, another round
He says, "I never complain, I never ask 'Why?'
Please do not let my dreams run dry
Underneath, underneath this Amarillo Sky"
"Underneath this Amarillo Sky"

[Verse]
I need a red
To smoke that long week straight out of my head
Until there's nothing left
A shot of patron
To kick this good time off
Get it going strong
Baby pour it on

[Chorus]
Slip on out where the weekend lives
Put a Friday night hurt on a bottle of fifth
Getting gone to the song's that the midnight's playing
Put a little way out underneath these boots
Kick that switch to what we do
Light it up, let it out, stir it up, turning dirt to dust
Yeah turning dirt to dust

[Verse 2]
Yeah, I need you baby, right there with me
Love that way you make me wanna lose it, go crazy
You know it gets me girl, when you dance like that
You know it kills me girl, with your hands like that
Thinking 'bout it, don't wanna go another minute without it

[Chorus]
Slip on out where the weekend lives
Put a Friday night hurt on a bottle of fifth
Getting gone to the song's that the midnight's playing
Put a little way out underneath these boots
Kick that switch to what we do
Light it up, let it out, stir it up, turning dirt to dust
Yeah turning dirt to dust

[Bridge]
You know it gets me girl, when you dance like that
You know it kills me girl, with your hands like that
Thinking 'bout it, don't wanna go another minute without it

[Chorus]
Slip on out where the weekend lives
Put a Friday night hurt on a bottle of fifth
Getting gone to the song's that the midnight's playing
Put a little way out underneath these boots
Kick that switch to what we do
Light it up, let it out, stir it up, turning dirt to dust
Yeah turning dirt to dust

[Outro]
Light it up, let it out, stir it up, turning dirt to dust
Yeah turning dirt to dust
Light it up, let it out, stir it up, turning dirt to dust

[Verse 1]
You ain’t got a dress that I don’t like
You ain’t got a pair of jeans that don’t fit you just right
There’s not a minute in the day
That you don’t knock me out, you don’t blow me away

[Pre-Chorus]
But, girl, now that the sun's gone down (whoa-oh-oh)
Looking at you right here and now, baby

[Chorus]
Somethin' about that southern sky
Sitting back behind that moon
It goes perfect with your eyes
Girl, tonight looks good on you
It's something about the way you're smiling
Making the stars fall right on queue
I just gotta tell you, baby
Tonight looks good on you

[Verse 2]
I can taste the midnight on your lips
Makes me just wanna lean in for another kiss
Wind blowing your hair around
Girl, it makes me want to lay you down
You've been beautiful a million times
But I've never seen you look like this, no

[Chorus]
Somethin' about that southern sky
Sitting back behind that moon
It goes perfect with your eyes
Girl, tonight looks good on you
It's something about the way you're smiling
Making the stars fall right on queue
I just gotta tell you, baby
Tonight looks good on you

[Bridge]
Looks so good on your skin
I don't ever, no, I never
I don't ever, ever want to end, baby

[Chorus]
Somethin' about that southern sky
Sitting back behind that moon
It goes perfect with your eyes
Girl, tonight looks good on you
It's something about the way you're smiling
Making the stars fall right on queue
I just gotta tell you, baby
Tonight looks good on you

[Outro]
Tonight looks good on you
I just gotta tell you, baby

You look good at party
Good at the bar
Something bout underneath these stars

You look good at the house
Good in the car
You're looking so good anywhere you are

Tonight, tonight looks good on you
Tonight looks good on you
I just gotta tell you, baby

[Verse 1]
I blew right past that city limit sign
Into that little town we used to own
The co-op and the quick stop were all boarded up
And those yellow lines faded on the road

[Pre-Chorus]
Man I swear I can still hear you singing
Like an angel through my Chevy stereo
Oh every turn, every street, I drop down a memory
You're everywhere we used to go

[Chorus]
I still look for your car
I still stop at the bar on the weekend, drinking too much Crown
I'm still chasing the buzz, yeah that used to be us
Keeps me up like we're still going down
Still feeling you like you never said goodbye
Like you were mine

[Verse 2]
Sometimes this take-me-back truck
Talks me into burning gas
Past your house
A little south where the gravel runs out
But it never brings you back

[Chorus]
I still look for your car
I still stop at the bar on the weekend, drinking too much Crown
I'm still chasing the buzz, yeah that used to be us
Keeps me up like we're still going down
Still feeling you like you never said goodbye
Baby, like you were mine

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh yeah, still feels you're mine
Man I swear I can still hear you singing
Like an angel through my Chevy stereo
Oh every turn, every street, I drop down a memory
You're everywhere we used to go

[Chorus]
I still look for your car
I still stop at the bar on the weekend, drinking too much Crown
I'm still chasing the buzz, yeah that used to be us
Keeps me up like we're still going down
Still feeling you like you never said goodbye
Baby, like you were mine
Yeah it still feels like you're mine

[Outro]
Man I swear I can still hear you singing
Like an angel through my Chevy stereo
Oh every turn, every street, I drop down a memory
You're everywhere we used to go

[Verse 1]
You wanna see what over looks like?
Ya ain't gotta go far, just a few blocks down
You wanna see a picture of goodbye?
Chairs on the table
Smoke hanging 'round the ceiling from the night before
Light coming through the crack in the door

[Chorus]
Nothing says gone like a parking lot with only one car in it
Nothing says gone like an empty glass
Or sitting on the bar in the middle of the day
In a blue light haze, all alone
Nothing says gone like high noon neon

[Verse 2]
She could be a left lane blur
Wind in her hair, blowing through another town
Or staring out over a wing
Tears on her face, head in the clouds
It doesn't really matter now

[Chorus]
Nothing says gone like a parking lot with only one car in it
Nothing says gone like an empty glass
Or sitting on the bar in the middle of the day
In a blue light haze, all alone
Nothing says gone like high noon neon

Nothing says gone like 12 o clock on the rocks
And nothing says over like a parking lot with only one car in it
Nothing says gone like an empty glass
Or sitting on the bar in the middle of the day
In a blue light haze, all alone
Nothing says gone like high noon neon

[Verse 1]
Let's don't say goodbye
I hate the way it sounds
So if you don't mind
Let's just say for now

[Chorus]
See you when I see you
Another place some other time
If I ever get down your way
Or you're ever up around mine
We'll laugh about the old days
And catch up on the new
Yeah see you when I see you
And I hope it's some day soon

[Verse 2]
God made this old world round
And maybe it's that way
So that paths that we go down
Yeah will cross again someday
And someday I'll

[Chorus]
See you when I see you
Another place some other time
If I ever get down your way
Or you're ever up around mine
We'll laugh about the old days
And catch up on the new
Yeah see you when I see you
And I hope it's some day real soon
And I hope it's some day soon

[Chorus]
See you when I see you
Another place some other time
If I ever get down your way
If you're ever up around mine - just stop by
We'll laugh about the old days
And catch up on the new
Yeah I'll see you when i see you
'Till then my prayers are with you
And I hope it's some day soon

[Outro]
I'll see you when I see you

[Verse 1]
Girl I know we just had the talk
Said we needed some time to cool it off
And I've been on my side of town, just staying low
You come walking in this little bar
Like you could set off that fire alarm
And one little drink won't hurt but don't you know

[Chorus]
Girl we're lightning striking matches
That's what always happens
When we get too close
When you start dancing in the neon
Whisper baby dream on
Then the whiskey hits the coke
Next thing you know we're going up in smoke

[Verse 2]
We start out slow like a cigarette
Burn all night like we always did
They'll be sweeping up the ashes when we go
Yeah, we're playing with a fire we can't control
And we both know

[Chorus]
Girl we're lightning striking matches
That's what always happens
When we get too close
When you start dancing in the neon
Whisper baby dream on
Then the whiskey hits the coke
Next thing you know we're going up in smoke

[Bridge]
Going up, going up, going up in smoke
Going up, going up, going up in smoke
Going up, going up, going up in smoke
Going up, up, up in smoke

[Chorus]
Girl we're lightning striking matches
That's what always happens
When we get too close
When you start dancing in the neon
Whisper baby dream on
Then the whiskey hits the coke
Next thing you know we're going up in smoke
Yeah, we're going up in smoke
Yeah, we're going up in smoke

[Verse 1]
Right outside of this one church town
There's a gold dirt road to a whole lot of nothin'
Got a deed to the land, but it ain't my ground
This is God's country
We pray for rain, and thank Him when it's fallen
'Cause it brings the grain and a little bit of money
We put it back in the plate
I guess that's why they call it God's country

[Chorus]
I saw the light in a sunrise
Sittin' back in a 40 on the muddy riverside
Gettin' baptized in holy water and 'shine with the dogs runnin'
Saved by the sound of the been found
Dixie whistled in the wind, that'll get you Heaven bound
The Devil went down to Georgia but he didn't stick around
This is God's country

[Verse 2]
We turn the dirt and work until the week's done
We take a break and break bread on Sunday
Then do it all again
'Cause we're proud to be from God's country (Yeah)

[Chorus]
I saw the light in a sunrise
Sittin' back in a 40 on the muddy riverside
Gettin' baptized in holy water and 'shine with the dogs runnin'
Saved by the sound of the been found
Dixie whistled in the wind, that'll get you Heaven bound
The Devil went down to Georgia but he didn't stick around
This is God's country

[Interlude]
(This is God's country)
God's country

[Bridge]
I don't care what my headstone reads
Or what kind of pinewood box I end up in
When it's my time, lay me six feet deep
In God's country (Yeah)

[Chorus]
I saw the light in a sunrise
Sittin' back in a 40 on the muddy riverside
Gettin' baptized in holy water and 'shine with the dogs runnin'
Saved by the sound of the been found
Dixie whistled in the wind, that'll get you Heaven bound
The Devil went down to Georgia but he didn't stick around
This is God's country (God's country, I saw the light)
Yeah, I saw the light in a sunrise
Sittin' back in a 40 on the muddy riverside
Gettin' baptized in holy water and 'shine with the dogs runnin' (Yeah)
Saved by the sound of the been found
Dixie whistled in the wind, that'll get you Heaven bound
The Devil went down to Georgia but he didn't stick around
This is God's country

[Verse 1]
Her kisses taste like whiskey
Burning through my veins
She don't know how to miss me
She hits right where she aims
Baby's got my number and she's calling me up
Knows what she's doing with a single touch

[Chorus]
She's turning me on, turning me on
Pushing my buttons like it ain't no thing
If I'm what she wants, she gets what she wants
The neon's buzzing when she pulls that string
Turning me on like it's her job
Sometimes, I think she must get off
On turning me on, turning me on

[Verse 2]
Knows how to set me on fire
She's always holding the match
And when my body's beside hers
There ain't no turning back
She's Revlon red in the blackest night
Lighting up the room in the world just like

[Chorus]
She's turning me on, turning me on
Pushing my buttons like it ain't no thing
If I'm what she wants, she gets what she wants
The neon's buzzing when she pulls that string
Turning me on like it's her job
Sometimes I think she must get off
On turning me on, turning me on

[Bridge]
Once she gets it started, man, it's all night long
She's the needle on the vinyl of a midnight song
She's turning me on, turning me on

[Chorus]
She's turning me on, turning me on
Pushing my buttons like it ain't no thing
If I'm what she wants, she gets what she wants
The neon's buzzing when she pulls that string
Turning me on like it's her job
Sometimes I think she must get off
On turning me on, turning me on, yeah

[Outro]
Turning me on, turning me on
Turning me on, turning me on
Turning me on, turning me on
Turning me, turning me, turning me, turning me, turning me on
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Turning me, turning me, turning me, turning me, turning me on
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Turning me, turning me, turning me, turning me, turning me on
Ooh, ooh, ooh

[Verse 1]
When you put two and two together
You figure out love's got four letters
I shoulda known that when I met her
But she had to spell it out for me
After all that second guessing
It's been a long hard history lesson
Hell, that's a class I got an F in
But now I understand perfectly

[Chorus]
She put the her in hurt
She put the why in try
She put the S.O.B. in sober
She put the hang in hangover (Hangover)
She put the ex in sex
She put the low in blow
She put a big F.U. in my future
Yeah, she’s got a way
She’s got a way with words
Yeah, she's got a way with words

[Verse 2]
Little words like "I" and "do"
Lying, cheating, screwed
Yeah, all the words I thought I knew
They got a brand new meaning now

[Chorus]
She put the her in hurt
She put the why in try
She put the S.O.B. in sober
She put the hang in hangover (Hangover)
She put the ex in sex
She put the low in blow
She put a big F.U. in my future
Yeah, she’s got a way
She’s got a way with words
(Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh)
Yeah, she's got a way with words
(Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh)
She put the her in hurt
She put the why in try
She put the S.O.B. in sober
She put the hang in hangover (Hangover)
She put the ex in sex
She put the low in blow
She put a big F.U. in my future
Yeah, she’s got a way
She’s got a way with words
(Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh)
Yeah, she's got a way with words
(Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh)

[Outro]
She's got a way with words
She's got a way with words
Yeah, she's got a way with words

[Intro: Blake Shelton]
Red-red-red-red-red-red-red-red-redneck

[Verse 1: Blake Shelton]
Well the boys 'round here don't listen to The Beatles
Run ol' Bocephus through a jukebox needle
At the honky-tonk, where their boots stomp
All night, what
(That's right)
Yeah, and what they call work, diggin' in the dirt
Gotta get it in the ground 'fore the rain come down
To get paid, to get the girl
And your four-wheel drive
A country boy can survive

[Chorus: Blake Shelton]
Yeah, the boys 'round here
Drinking that ice cold beer
Talkin' 'bout girls, talkin' 'bout trucks
Runnin' them red dirt roads out, kicking up dust
The boys 'round here
Sendin' up a prayer to the man upstairs
Backwoods legit, don't take no shit
Chew tobacco, chew tobacco, chew tobacco, spit
Aww, heck
Red-red-red-red-red-red-redneck

[Verse 2: Blake Shelton]
Well the boys 'round here, they're keeping it country
Ain't a damn one know how to do the dougie
(You don't do the dougie?)
Nah, not in Kentucky
But these girls 'round here, yep, they still love me
Yea, the girls 'round here, they all deserve a whistle
Shakin' that sugar, sweet as Dixie crystal
They like that y'all and southern drawl
And just can't help it cause they just keep fallin'

[Chorus: Blake Shelton]
Yeah, the boys 'round here
Drinking that ice cold beer
Talkin' 'bout girls, talkin' 'bout trucks
Runnin' them red dirt roads out, kicking up dust
The boys 'round here
Sendin' up a prayer to the man upstairs
Backwoods legit, don't take no shit
Chew tobacco, chew tobacco, chew tobacco, spit
Aww, heck
Red-Red-Red-Red-Red-Red-Redneck

[Bridge: Pistol Annies]
(Let me hear you say)
Ooh, let's ride
Ooh, let's ride
Down to the river side

[Bridge: Blake Shelton & Pistol Annies]
Ooh, let's ride
Hey now girl, hop inside
Me and you gon' take a little ride to the river
Let's ride (That's right)
Ooh, let's ride

Kissing and the crickets is the only sound

And do you wanna get down with a

With, the boys 'round here
Drinking that ice cold beer
Talkin' 'bout girls, talkin' 'bout trucks
Runnin' them red dirt roads out, kicking up dust

Sendin' up a prayer to the man upstairs
Backwoods legit, don't take no shit
Chew tobacco, chew tobacco, chew tobacco, spit
Ooh, let's ride

Ooh, let's ride
So come on girl, hop inside
Me and you, we're gonna take a little ride
Ooh, let's ride
Mhm, yeah

Kissing and the crickets is the only sound

We out of town
Ooh, let's ride
Girl you gotta get down with a

Come on through the country side
Ooh, let's ride
Down to the river side

[Verse 1]
Girl, it's high time I tell ya
No more messin' around
Time to lay these cards on the table
And just throw it on out
I'm talkin' you and me with the same street name
Same last name, same everything
It's a real thing, a how I feel thing
So I'm a go on and take a swing

[Chorus]
You find the spot and I'll find the money
You be the pretty and I'll be the funny
You plant the flowers, I'll plant the kisses
Baby, let's get right down to business
I'll hang the pictures, you hang the stars
You pick the paint, I'll pick a guitar
Sing you a song out there with the crickets and the frogs
You name the babies and I'll name the dogs, yeah

[Verse 2]
You can park your car in the driveway
I'll park my truck in the grass
I'll put a little swing on the front porch
If you put a little tea in my glass
Watch a sunset from a gravel road
Kiss me in the kitchen on your tippy toes
Still lovin' on you when the rooster crows
Watchin' way more than the garden grow

[Chorus]
You find the spot and I'll find the money
You be the pretty and I'll be the funny
You plant the flowers, I'll plant the kisses
Baby, let's get right down to business
I'll hang the pictures, you hang the stars
You pick the paint, I'll pick a guitar
Sing you a song out there with the crickets and the frogs
You name the babies and I'll name the dogs

[Bridge]
Yeah, layin' next to you every night
Sounds like a damn good life

[Chorus]
You find the spot and I'll find the money
You be the pretty and I'll be the funny
You plant the flowers, I'll plant the kisses
Baby, let's get right down to business
I'll hang the pictures, you hang the stars
You pick the paint, I'll pick a guitar
Sing you a song out there with the crickets and the frogs
You name the babies and I'll name the dogs

[Outro]
Yeah, I'll name the dogs
You name the babies and I'll name the dogs
Yeah, I'll name the dogs

[Verse 1]
Baby where are you going now?
Do you ever really know?
Oh you hate to be tied down
But you hate to sleep alone

[Pre-Chorus]
I bet you still think about me
Yeah I bet you still think about me

[Chorus]
Like I think about you
Even when I don't want to
There’s just something about you baby
There’s nothing that I can do
I think about you, you were always wild and free
I know we couldn’t hold on forever, but baby
I bet you still think about me

[Verse 2]
Are you driving up the coast?
Are you wearing any shoes?
Did you  outrun all your ghosts?
Like you were always tryna do...

[Pre-Chorus]
I bet you still think about me
Yeah I bet you still think about me

[Chorus]
Like I think about you
Even when I don't want to
There’s just something about you baby
There’s nothing that I can do
I think about you, you were always wild and free
I know we couldn’t hold on forever, but baby
I bet you still think about me

Like I think about you
Even when I don't want to
There’s just something about you baby
There’s nothing that I can do
I think about you, you were always wild and free
I know we couldn’t hold on forever, but baby
I bet you still think about me

[Outro]
Yeah I bet you still think about me
Yeah I bet you still think about me

[Produced by Scott Hendricks]

[Verse 1]
What's your all-time high, your good as it gets?
Your hands down best ever make-up sex?
What's your guilty pleasure, your old go to?
Well if you asked me, mine would be you

[Verse 2]
What's your worst hangover, your best night yet?
Your 90 proof, your Marlboro Red?
The best damn thing you lucked into
That's easy girl, mine would be you

[Chorus]
Mine would be you
Sun keeps shinin', back road flyin'
Singin' like crazy fools
Makin' up our own words, laughin' 'til it hurts
Baby, if I had to choose
My best day ever, my finest hour
My wildest dream come true
Mine would be you

[Verse 3]
What's your double dare, your go all in?
The craziest thing you ever did?
Plain as your name in this tattoo
Look on my arm, mine would be you

[Chorus]
Mine would be you
Sun keeps shinin', back road flyin'
Singin' like crazy fools
Makin' up our own words, laughin' 'til it hurts
Baby, if I had to choose
My best day ever, my finest hour
My wildest dream come true
Mine would be you

[Bridge]
What's the greatest chapter in your book?
Are there pages where it hurts to look?
What's the one regret you can't work through?
You got it baby, mine would be you
Yeah, you got it baby, mine would be you

[Chorus]
Mine would be you
Taillights fadin', daylight breakin'
Standing there like a fool
When I should've been runnin', yellin' out somethin'
To make you want to hold on to
The best love ever, girl, can you tell me
The one thing you'd rather die than lose?
'Cause mine would be you

[Outro]
Mine would be...you

[Verse 1]
She left without leaving a number
Said, she needed to clear her mind
He figured she'd gone back to Austin
Cuz she talked about it all the time
It was almost a year
Before she called him up
Three rings and an answering machine
Is what she got

[Chorus]
If you're calling 'bout the car, I sold it
If this is Tuesday night I'm bowling
If you've got something to sell
You're wasting your time, I'm not buying
If it's anybody else, wait for the tone
You know what to do
And P.S. if this is Austin
I still love you

[Verse 2]
The telephone fell to the counter
She heard but she couldn't believe
What kind of man would hang on that long
What kind of love that must be
She waited three days
And then she tried again
She didn't know what she'd say
But she heard three rings and then

[Chorus]
If it's Friday night I'm at the ballgame
And first thing Saturday, if it don't rain
I'm headed out to the lake
And I'll be gone, all weekend long
But I'll call you back when I get home
On Sunday afternoon
And P.S. if this is Austin
I still love you

[Bridge]
Well, this time she left her number
But not another word
Then she waited by the phone on Sunday evening
And this is what he heard

[Chorus]
If you're calling 'bout my heart, it's still yours
I should've listened to it a little more
Then it wouldn't have taken me so long
To know where I belong
And by the way, boy
This is no machine you're talking to
Can't you tell, this is Austin
And I still love you
I still love you

[Verse 1]
There's something 'bout yesterday
How fast it all flies away
I don't know what it is about a goodbye kiss
That makes you wanna stay
We were crazy then we were over
We were breaking up, making love, a runaway roller coaster

[Chorus]
Every time I hear that song
I’m standing in the pouring rain
On your front lawn and ooh-ooh-ooh
I still think about you-ooh-ooh
Every time I hear that song
It's like the first time it came on and ooh-ooh-ooh
I still think about you-ooh-ooh
I still think about you

[Verse 2]
There’s something in the bittersweet feeling of a memory
Right there in the moment, all I ever wanted was you and me
We were crying, we were wasted
We were dying, when they played it

[Chorus]
Every time I hear that song
I’m standing in the pouring rain
On your front lawn and ooh-ooh-ooh
I still think about you-ooh-ooh
Every time I hear that song
It's like the first time it came on and ooh-ooh-ooh
I still think about you-ooh-ooh
I still think about you
Oh, I still think about you

[Refrain]
There's a soundtrack in my mind
That takes me back in time
When I hear that melody
I think about you and me

[Chorus]
Every time I hear that song
I’m standing in the pouring rain
On your front lawn and ooh-ooh-ooh
I still think about you-ooh-ooh
Every time I hear that song
It's like the first time it came on and ooh-ooh-ooh
I still think about you-ooh-ooh
I still think about you
Oh, I still think about you
I still think about you
Yeah, I still think about you

[Refrain]
There's a soundtrack in my mind
That takes me back in time
When I hear that melody

[Click here to read about the first time Blake drank sangria]

[Verse 1]
You're crashin' into me like waves on the coast
Every time we talk, you move in close
I don't want you to stop, I don't want you to stop tonight
We've got the last two glasses on a straw hut bar
Tryin' to remember what number we are
String of white lights making your eyes shine tonight

[Chorus]
We're buzzing like that no vacancy sign out front
Your skin is begging to be kissed by a little more than the sun
You take my hand in yours, you lean in and
Your lips taste like sangria
Your lips taste like sangria

[Verse 2]
Wreckin' ball dancin' down the hallway
You're holding your shoes, wearing my shades
We fall against the door, we fall into a wild warm kiss

[Chorus]
We're buzzing like that no vacancy sign out front
Your skin is begging to be kissed by a little more than the sun
You take my hand in yours, you lean in and
Your lips taste like sangria
Your lips taste like sangria

[Bridge]
Only thing I want to do tonight
Is drink you like a Spanish wine
Let you let this head of mine keep spinning, spinning around

[Chorus]
We're buzzing like that no vacancy sign out front
Your skin is begging to be kissed by a little more than the sun
You take my hand in yours, you lean in and
Your lips taste like sangria
Your lips taste like sangria
Your lips taste like sangria
Your lips taste like sangria
Oh

[Outro]
Only thing I want to do tonight
Is drink you like a Spanish wine
Let you let this head of mine keep spinning, spinning around

[Verse 1]
Girl, you're getting over him and I'm getting over her
The eyes have it made, ain't gotta say a word
Misery loves company, that's why it's you and me
Buying each other drinks
Back at the bar, as thick as thieves
Stealing these little sips
Doing our best to make the best of the worst of it

[Chorus]
Keep playing them songs, keep singing along
Keep leaning it on in closer
Keep salting the rim, getting even with her and with him before the night is over
That first kiss was like a Colorado hit
We better keep on keeping it lit
'Til we can't remember, can't remember
What we came here to forget

[Verse 2]
Go ahead and check your phone, like I've been checking mine
Nobody's ex is texting for a rewind
Looks like it's just me and you
Falling in love just enough to get us through
What we're get'in through

[Chorus]
Keep playing them songs, keep singing along
Keep leaning it on in closer
Keep salting the rim, getting even with her and with him before the night is over
That first kiss was like a Colorado hit
We better keep on keeping it lit
'Til we can't remember, can't remember
What we came here to forget (yeah)
Just what we came here to forget

[Bridge]
Looks like it's just me and you
Falling in love just enough to get us through
What we're getting through

[Chorus]
Keep playing them songs, keep singing along
Keep leaning it on in closer
Keep salting the rim, getting even with her and with him before the night is over
That first kiss was like a Colorado hit
We better keep on keeping it lit
'Til we can't remember, can't remember
What we came here to forget

[Outro]
What we came here to forget
What we came here to forget
Baby, baby
That's what we came here to forget

[Click here to read Blake’s story behind “Sure Be Cool If You Did”]

[Verse 1: Blake Shelton]
I was gonna keep it real like chill like only have a drink or two
But it turned into a party when I started talking to you
Now you're standing in the neon looking like a high I wanna be on
Baby it's your call, no pressure at all

[Chorus: Blake Shelton]
You don’t have to throw back your pretty pink lemonade shooter and lean a little closer
You don’t have to keep on smiling that smile that’s driving me wild and when the night is almost over
Meet me in the middle of a moonlit Chevy bench seat and do a little bit of country song, hanging on
You don’t have to keep me fallin’ like this
But it’d sure be cool if you did

[Verse 2: Blake Shelton]
You can’t shoot me down cause you already knocked me dead
Got me falling apart with my heart talking out of my head
Let your mind take a little back road
Just as far as you wanna go
Baby I’ll do whatever you wanna do

[Chorus: Blake Shelton]
You don't have to throw back your pretty pink lemonade shooter
And lean a little closer
You don't have to keep on smiling that smile that's driving me wild
And when the night is almost over
Meet me in the middle of a moonlit Chevy bench seat
And do a little bit of country song, hanging on
You don't have to keep me falling like this
But it'd sure be cool if you did

[Bridge: Blake Shelton]
Have a night that you'll never forget
And now you're standing in the neon
Looking like a high I wanna be on

[Chorus: Blake Shelton]
You don't have to throw back your pretty pink lemonade shooter
And lean a little closer
You don't have to keep on smiling that smile that's driving me wild
And when the night is almost over
Meet me in the middle of a moonlit Chevy bench seat
And do a little bit of country song, hanging on
You don't have to keep me falling like this
But it'd sure be cool if you did

[Verse 1: Blake Shelton]
The sun is setting on your last good try
Here I am again with half a goodbye
Wonder if you're really gone this time
Just when I'm about to lose my mind
There you are again on my phone
The moon is rising and you're all alone
Maybe we could just hang a while
Maybe we can make each other smile

[Pre-Chorus: Blake Shelton]
Oh no, here I go

[Chorus: Blake Shelton & Gwen Stefani]
Why don't you go ahead and break my heart?
Why are you waiting, is it way too hard?
If moving on is what you wanna do
Why don't you do it? Why don't you do it, baby?
You can't tell me that we'll still be friends
And maybe someday we can try again
If you really need a brand new start
Why don't you go ahead and break my heart?

[Verse 2: Gwen Stefani]
I'd never ever meant to get so into you
Thought I was using you just to get me through
You know I'm broken, I don't trust anyone
Last thing I needed was to fall in love
You've got me dreaming, got me thinking, I've got some hope
There is nobody else I wanna get to know
But I'm so scared, I don't know what to do
How did you get me so into you?

[Pre-Chorus: Gwen Stefani]
Oh no, here I go

[Chorus: Blake Shelton & Gwen Stefani]
Why don't you go ahead and break my heart?
Why are you waiting, is it way too hard?
If moving on is what you wanna do
Why don't you do it? Why don't you do it, baby?
You can't tell me that we'll still be friends
And maybe someday we can try again
If you really need a brand new start
Why don't you go ahead and break my heart?

[Bridge: Blake Shelton & Gwen Stefani]
There's your reasons
There's your cards
What are you waiting for?
The one to break my heart

[Outro: Blake Shelton & Gwen Stefani]
Yeah, you can't tell me that we'll still be friends
And maybe someday we can try again
If you really need a brand new start
Why don't you go ahead and break my heart?
Oh, go on and break, go on and break my heart
Go on and break, go on and break my heart

[Verse 1]
I've been a walking heartache
I've made a mess of me
The person that I've been lately
Ain’t who I want to be
But you stay here right beside me
Watch as the storm blows through
And I need you

[Chorus]
'Cause God gave me you for the ups and downs
God gave me you for the days of doubt
And for when I think I've lost my way
There are no words here left to say, it's true
God gave me you
Gave me you

[Verse 2]
There's more here than what we’re seeing
A divine conspiracy
That you, an angel lovely
Could somehow fall for me
You'll always be love's great martyr
And I'll be the flattered fool
And I need you
Yeah!

[Chorus]
God gave me you for the ups and downs
God gave me you for the days of doubt
And for when I think I've lost my way
There are no words here left to say, it's true
God gave me you

[Verse 3]
On my own, I'm only
Half of what I could be
I can't do without you
We are stitched together
And what love has tethered
I pray we never undo

[Chorus]
'Cause God gave me you for the ups and downs
God gave me you for the days of doubt
God gave me you for the ups and downs
God gave me you for the days of doubt
And for when I think I've lost my way
There are no words here left to say, it's true
God gave me you, gave me you
He gave me you

[Verse 1]
I never thought you’d pick up the phone
It's Friday night, you should be out on the town
Didn't think you'd be sittin' at home all alone like me
Nothin' on TV, nothin' to do
Nothin' to keep my mind off you and me
And the way it was
Are you thinkin' 'bout it now because
I could be there in five
One more one last time

[Chorus]
We don't have to be lonely tonight
(I need you, want you, I'm right here)
We don't have to be lonely tonight
(I know we shouldn't, but I don't care)
I don't wanna be right, I don't wanna be strong
I just wanna hold you till the heartbreak's gone
When the sun comes up, we can both move on
But we don't have to be lonely tonight

[Verse 2]
That taste, that touch, the fire I miss
Those kiss me eyes, your red wine lips on mine
Like it used to be
Baby I want you and and you want me and

[Chorus]
We don't have to be lonely tonight
(I need you, want you, I'm right here)
We don't have to be lonely tonight
(I know we shouldn't, but I don't care)
I don't wanna be right, I don't wanna be strong
I just wanna hold you till the heart breaks stone
When the sun comes up, we can both move on
But we don't have to be lonely tonight

[Guitar Interlude]

I can be there in five
One more one last time

[Final Chorus]
We don't have to be lonely tonight
(Oh, I need you, and I'm right here)
We don't have to be lonely tonight, tonight, tonight

Yeah, yeah

[Verse 1]
Sometimes I'm the guy with the boys, kicking it back
Or the guy with a guitar singing on a country track
I might be the guy with an ice cold can
Stirring up dust on some old farmland
When I walk into the party with you girl, you change all that

[Chorus]
And I’m just the guy with the girl everybody wants to know
Wishin' you were there alone
Wonderin' how I ever got your little hand in mine
Lookin' over at ya like, "Ain’t she beautiful?"
I’m invisible, but I stand right there and smile
You're right beside me, oh and I see the same thing they’re seein'
But, I don’t mind being the guy with the girl, no

[Verse 2]
It's funny watchin' 'em do the way they do
They come walkin' up to me but they only wanna talk to you
And I don't blame 'em that they're hypnotized
They keep staring at your heartbreak eyes
It's like their heart starts stoppin' when you come walkin' into the room

[Chorus]
And I turn into the guy with the girl everybody wants to know
Wishin' you were there alone
Wonderin' how I ever got your little hand in mine
Lookin' over at ya like, "Ain’t she beautiful?"
I’m invisible, but I stand right there and smile
You're right beside me, oh and I see the same thing they’re seein'
But, I don’t mind being the guy with the girl

[Bridge]
The guy that don't know how he got her
But he ain't never gon' let her, never gon' let her go
Woah-oh, yeah

[Chorus]
I’m just the guy with the girl everybody wants to know
Wishin' you were there alone
Wonderin' how I ever got your little hand in mine
Lookin' over at ya like "ain’t she beautiful?"
I’m invisible, but, I stand right there and smile
You're right beside me, oh and I see the same thing they’re seein'
But, I don’t mind being the guy with the girl (Guy with the girl)

[Outro]
No, I don't mind being the guy with the girl (Guy with the girl)
Yeah, I'm just the guy with the girl
I'm always the guy with the girl
I don't mind it, baby
I don't mind it, baby
I'm always the guy with the girl

[Chorus]
Another Christmas day
Will come and go away
But I got so far to go
But I want to go home
I need to go home

[Verse 1]
Maybe surrounded by
Strangers and Christmas lights
I shouldn't feel so alone
But I want to go home
God I miss you, you know
I can close my eyes and see the angel on the tree
A blanket of snow outside
And all my friends and family
And though I know that you're no farther than a call away
I need to see your face
A call could never be the same

[Chorus]
Another Christmas day
Will come and go away
But I got so far to go
But I want to go home
I need to go home

[Verse 2]
Let me go home
I'm just too far from where you are
And I want to go home

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 3]
Now the reasons I'm so far away aren’t good enough
Whatever they need me for
I know that I need you more
So I'll do the things I got to do to get back to you
I need you to believe
I'll make it back by Christmas Eve

[Chorus]
Another Christmas day will come and go away
And I won’t leave you alone
No, I'm going to go home
I'm going to be home
Though I'm surrounded by
This cold December night
I feel so alone
I'm going to go home
Babe, I miss you you know

[Verse 4]
Let me go home
I've had my run baby I'm done
I'm coming back home
Let me go home
It'll all be alright
When I'm holding you tight
Cause this Christmas I'm home

[Verse 1]
She likes it when I call in sick to work
Spend the whole day hanging with her
I might get fired but that's alright
I'm doing what she likes
She likes it when I bring home fresh fajitas
And mix up a pitcher of margaritas
Catch a kind of buzz that lasts all night
Doing what she likes

[Chorus]
She likes hearing how good she looks in them blue jeans
Little kisses, sweeter than sweet tea
Things I whispered in her ear, oh my
I like doing what she likes
Like running my fingers through her long hair
Lighting watermelon candles upstairs
Letting them burn and holding her all night
I like doing what she likes

[Verse 2]
She likes it when I get past second gear
Sees gravel flying in the rear view mirror
Sometimes I'm pushing 95
Doing what she likes
And she likes it when I find a road that's dark
Can we pull up somewhere and park?
Turn the radio on and turn off the lights
Keep doing what she likes

[Chorus]
She likes hearing how good she looks in them blue jeans
Little kisses, sweeter than sweet tea
Things I whispered in her ear, oh my
I like doing what she likes
Like running my fingers through her long hair
Lighting watermelon candles upstairs
Letting them burn and holding her all night
I like doing what she likes

[Bridge]
She likes it when I sing her old silly songs
And throwing words where they don't belong
Sometimes we laugh 'til we almost cry
Doing what she likes
Doing what she likes

[Chorus]
She likes hearing how good she looks in them blue jeans
Little kisses, sweeter than sweet tea
Things I whispered in her ear, oh my
I like doing what she likes
Like running my fingers through her long hair
Lighting watermelon candles upstairs
Letting them burn and holding her all night
I like doing what she likes

[Outro]
Yeah, I like doing what she likes
Hmm, yeah

[Verse 1]
Well I caught my wife with another man
And it cost me ninety nine
On a prison farm in Georgia
Close to the Florida line
Well I'd been here for two long years
I finally made the warden my friend
And so he sentenced me to a life of ease
Taking care of Ol' Red

Now Ol' Red he's the damnedest dog that I've ever seen
Got a nose that can smell a two-day trail
He's a four-legged trackin' machine
You can consider yourself mighty lucky
To get past the gators and the quicksand beds
But all these years that I've been here
Aren’t nobody got past Red

[Chorus]
And the warden sang
Come on somebody
Why don't you run
Ol' Red's itchin' to have a little fun
Get my lantern
Get my gun
Red'll have you treed before the mornin' comes

[Verse 2]
Well I paid off the guard and I slipped out a letter
To my cousin up in Tennessee
Oh and he brought down a blue tick hound
She was pretty as she could be
Well they penned her up in the swampland
'Bout a mile just south of the gate
And I'd take Ol' Red for his evenin' run
I'd just drop him off and wait

[Chorus]
And the warden sang
Come on somebody
Why don't you run
Ol' Red's itchin' to have a little fun
Get my lantern
Get my gun
Red'll have you treed before the mornin' comes

[Verse 3]
Now Ol' Red got real used to seein'
His lady every night
And so I kept him away for three or four days
And waited till the time got right
Well I made my run with the evenin' sun
And I smiled when I heard them let Red out
Cause I was headed north to Tennessee
And Ol' Red was headed south

[Chorus]
And the warden sang
Come on somebody
Why don't you run
Ol' Red's itchin' to have a little fun
Get my lantern
Get my gun
Red'll have you treed before the mornin' comes

[Outro]
Now there's red-haired blue ticks all in the South
Love got me in here and love got me out

[Verse 1]
Girl, I been thinking 'bout us
And you know I ain't good at this stuff
These feelings piling up won't give me no rest
This might come out a little crazy
A little sideways, yeah maybe
I don't know how long it'll take me but I'll do my best

[Chorus 1]
You'll be my soft and sweet
I'll be your strong and steady
You'll be my glass of wine
I'll be your shot of whiskey
You'll be my sunny day
I'll be your shade tree
You'll be my honeysuckle
I'll be your honey bee

[Verse 2]
Yeah, that came out a little country
But every word was right on the money
And I got you smiling honey right back at me
Now hold on cause I aren’t done
There's more where that came from
Well you know I'm just having fun, but seriously

[Chorus 2]
If you'll be my Louisiana
I'll be your Mississippi
You'll be my Little Loretta
I'll be your Conway Twitty
You'll be my sugar, baby
I'll be your sweet iced tea
You'll be my honeysuckle
I'll be your honey bee

[Bridge]
Your kiss just said it all
I'm glad we had this talk
Nothing left to do but fall in each other’s arms
I could have said "I love you"
Could have wrote you a line or two
Baby, all I know to do is speak right from the heart

[Chorus 1]
You'll be my soft and sweet
I'll be your strong and steady
You'll be my glass of wine
I'll be your shot of whiskey
You'll be my sunny day
I'll be your shade tree
You'll be my honeysuckle
I'll be your honey bee

[Chorus 2]
If you'll be my Louisiana
I'll be your Mississippi
You'll be my Little Loretta
I'll be your Conway Twitty
You'll be my sugar, baby
I'll be your sweet iced tea
You'll be my honeysuckle
I'll be your honey bee

[Outro]
I'll be your honey bee

[Chorus 1]
Another summer day has come and gone away in Paris and Rome
But I want to go home
May be surrounded by a million people I, still feel all alone
I want to go home, oh, I miss you, you know

[Verse 1]
And I've been keeping all the letters that I wrote to you
Each one a line or two, I'm fine baby, how are you
I would send them but I know that it's just not enough
My words were cold and flat and you deserve more than that

[Chorus 2]
Another airplane, another sunny place, I'm lucky I know
But I want to go home, I've got to home
Let me go home
I'm just too far from where you are, I want to come home

[Verse 2]
And I feel just like I'm living someone else's life
It's like I just stepped outside when everything was goin' right
And I know just why you could not come along with me
This was not your dream, but you always believed in me

[Chorus 3]
Another winter day has come and gone away in even Paris and Rome
And I want to go home, let me go home
And I'm surrounded by a million people I, still feel alone
And I want to go home, oh, I miss you, you know

[Outro]
Let me go home
I've had my run, baby I'm done, I'm comin' back home
Let me go home
It'll all be alright, I'll be home tonight, I'm coming back home

[ “My Eyes”]

[Verse 1]
Those high heels with that sun dress
Turquoise heart hanging 'round your neck
Red lips like wine, want to drink them up
And keep on drinking' 'til you make me drunk

Tied up hair, want to let it down
And just let the rest fall to the ground
You take beautiful to the max
Can't help myself when you look like that

[Chorus]
Come a little closer, come a little closer
Come a little closer, girl the way you look tonight
My eyes are the only thing I don't want to take off of you
Come a little closer, come a little closer
Come a little closer, girl the way you look tonight
My eyes are the only thing I don't want to take off of you

[Verse 2]
There's a million stars dancing in the sky
A picture perfect moon so bright
But I don't care, I'm looking at you
From where I stand you can beat the view

[Chorus]
Come a little closer, come a little closer
Come a little closer, girl the way you look tonight
My eyes are the only thing I don't want to take off of you
Come a little closer, come a little closer
Come a little closer, girl the way you look tonight
My eyes are the only thing I don't want to take off of you

[Verse 3]
My eyes have seen
Some amazing things
But girl, my eyes aren’t seen
Nothing quite like you, hey baby

[Chorus]
Come a little closer, come a little closer
Come a little closer, girl the way you look tonight
My eyes are the only thing I don't want to take off of you
Come a little closer, come a little closer
Come a little closer, girl the way you look tonight
My eyes are the only thing I don't want to take off of you
Come a little closer, come a little closer
Come a little closer, girl the way you look tonight
My eyes are the only thing I don't want to take off of you

[Verse 1]
I'm a rebel
I been known to dance with the devil
So how'd I get up on your level?
You're an angel sent from heaven down to me
I'm rough around the edges
You're a snapshot of perfection
I was headed in the wrong direction
I was reckless
Now I've just got one question

[Chorus]
Why me, out of everybody, baby?
Why me? You could have picked anybody
Why me? When I see you looking at me
I gotta ask, what did I do
To get to be the one you gave your heart to?
Walk up in a party on my arm
Who would've thought you would wanna wake up
Every day beside me
Baby, why me?

[Verse 2]
I remember night one
Looking around for the right one
Saw you sitting there, said "Well, I'm done"
And I walked over
Even though you were outta my league
You were diamonds in the sky
I was dirt on a plow
You're all-American pretty
I'm a one-horse town
First smile you gave me
I was thinking it then
And I'm still thinking it now

[Chorus]
Why me, out of everybody, baby?
Why me? You could have picked anybody
Why me? When I see you looking at me
I gotta ask, what did I do
To get to be the one you gave your heart to?
Walk up in a party on my arm
Who would've thought you would wanna wake up
Every day beside me
Baby, why me?

[Post-Chorus]
Yeah, baby, why me?
Baby, why me?

[Bridge]
Why me? What did I do right?
Why me, kissing you goodnight?
You say you'll never let me go
Oh, it's crazy girl, I guess I'll never know

[Chorus]
Why me, out of everybody, baby?
Why me? You could have picked anybody
Why me? When I see you looking at me
I gotta ask, what did I do
To get to be the one you gave your heart to?
Walk up in a party on my arm
Who would've thought you would wanna wake up
Every day beside me
Baby, why me?

[Outro]
Oh baby, why me?
Baby, why me?
Baby, why me?
Baby, why me?

[Verse 1]
Just a bunch of poor boys, daddy's girls
Children of the corn field
Tryna turn a shift job into a dollar bill
We wear them muddy boots
Stay true to how we're raised
Ain't nothin' bout us fake

[Chorus]
You know we're straight out of that dirty south
Dirty roads, nobody got no money
Got them shined up pickup trucks
Whistlin' at them honies
From the country, yes sir
You know we're straight out of that long week work
At night, everybody wanna party
All night long, bonfire on the back 40
In the middle of nowhere, ain't nobody leavin' here
Til we're straight out of cold beer, straight out of cold beer

[Verse 2]
Just a bunch of John Deere junkies
Gettin' funky to some old Hank
Nothin' been stuck in the mud that we can't
Hook up to a rusty chain in the summer or in the rain
Yeah, it's a kind of thing

[Chorus]
You know we're straight out of that dirty south
Dirty roads, nobody got no money
Got them shined up pickup trucks
Whistlin' at them honies
From the country, yes sir
You know we're straight out of that long week work
At night, everybody wanna party
All night long, bonfire on the back 40
In the middle of nowhere, ain't nobody leavin' here
Til we're straight out of cold beer, straight out of cold beer

[Chorus]
You know we're straight out of that dirty south
Dirty roads, nobody got no money
Got them shined up pickup trucks
Whistlin' at them honies
From the country, yes sir
You know we're straight out of that long week work
At night, everybody wanna party
All night long, bonfire on the back 40
In the middle of nowhere, ain't nobody leavin' here
Til we're straight out of cold beer, straight out of cold beer

[Verse 1]
I picked up the phone
She said hey it's me
I know it feels like forever
Since I've heard your voice
But I guess that's how it had to be
So we talked awhile
Still, she said I better go
But before we hung up she said
There's something you need to know

[Chorus]
I found someone
It just happened outta the blue
Even though I'm moving on
It don't mean that I don't still love you
You'll always have
A place here in my heart
But somewhere in this new life I've begun
I found someone

[Verse 2]
Well I wasn't surprised
Still, it hit me kind of hard
It's hard to believe a little space and time
Could turn into miles and worlds apart
I said I'm happy for you
You deserve the very best
Since you've been gone
I've done some praying
Some searching for myself

[Chorus]
And I found someone
It just happened outta the blue
And even though I'm moving on
It don't mean that I don't still love you
You'll always have
A place here in my heart
But somewhere in this new life I've begun
I found someone

[Bridge]
But it took tears and time down on my knees
And it's not who you'd ever guess
Or who I dreamed it'd be
But in the mirror one morning looking back at me

[Chorus]
I found someone
Just happened out of the blue
And it took everything I had
It took me losing you
But you'll always have
A place here in my heart
But somewhere in this new life I've begun
Looking for my place under the sun
I found someone

[Verse 1]
Don't need no tab, don't need no VISA
No bouncer looking like a wannabe Vin Diesel
Don't need your friends all getting jealous
Watching you walk in looking so good that you could sell it

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Uh-uh, not again
Girl, let's get this party started
Where the party always ends

[Chorus]
Got a yellow backdoor porch party light
Got a speaker in the window playing Barry White
You and me out here swaying, stargazing
Gonna bring it back in, break the candles out
Get the mood turned on and the lights out
Lose a little something black and lacy in the couch
At the house

[Post-Chorus]
At the house
Yeah, that's what it's all about

[Verse 2]
Don't need no plans (nope), no reservations (uh-uh)
Nobody calling me up saying, "Where you at, man? We waiting"
We can keep it on chill (oh, yeah), or get a little obnoxious (uh-huh)
Go ahead and get your freak on, ain't nobody gonna stop us

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Uh-uh, girl, just the essentials
You and me, a little Smithworks
Rocking out this residential

[Chorus]
Got a yellow backdoor porch party light
Got a speaker in the window playing Barry White
You and me out here swaying, stargazing
Gonna bring it back in, break the candles out
Get the mood turned on and the lights out
Lose a little something black and lacy in the couch
At the house

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Uh-uh, not again
Girl, let's get this party started
Where the party always ends

[Chorus]
Got a yellow backdoor porch party light
Got a speaker in the window playing Barry White
You and me out here swaying, stargazing
Gonna bring it back in, break the candles out
Get the mood turned on and the lights out
Lose a little something black and lacy in the couch
At the house

[Outro]
Yeah, at the house
That's what it's all about
Mmm, yeah
At the house

[Intro: All]
Red, red, red, red, red, red, red, red, redneck

[Verse 1: Blake Shelton]
Well the boys 'round here don't listen to The Beatles
Run ol' Bocephus through a jukebox needle
At the honky-tonk, where their boots stomp
All night, what
(That's right)
Yea, and what they call work, digging in the dirt
Gotta get it in the ground 'fore the rain come down
To get paid, to get the girl
And your four wheel drive
(A country boy can survive)

[Chorus: Blake Shelton, All]
Yeah the boys 'round here
Drinking that ice cold beer
Talkin' 'bout girls, talkin' 'bout trucks
Runnin' them red dirt roads out, kicking up dust
The boys 'round here
Sending up a prayer to the man upstairs
Backwoods legit, don't take no lip
Chew tobacco, chew tobacco, chew tobacco, spit
Aw heck
Red red red red red red redneck

[Verse 2 - Blake Shelton, Miranda Lambert]
Well the boys 'round here, they're keeping it country
Ain't a damn one know how to do the dougie
You don't do the dougie
No, not in Kentucky
But these girls 'round here yep, they still love me
Yea, the girls 'round here, they all deserve a whistle
Shakin' that sugar, sweet as Dixie crystal
They like that y'all and southern drawl
And just can't help it cause they just keep fallin'

[Chorus: Blake Shelton]
For the boys 'round here
Drinking that ice cold beer
Talkin' 'bout girls, talkin' 'bout trucks
Runnin' them red dirt roads out, kicking up dust
The boys 'round here
Sending up a prayer to the man upstairs
Backwoods legit, don't take no lip
Chew tobacco, chew tobacco, chew tobacco, spit

[Bridge: Blake Shelton, Miranda Lambert, reba McEntire, All]
Let me hear you say
Ooh let's ride
To the country side
Ooh let's ride
Down to the river side
Hey now girl, hop inside Ooh let's ride
Me and you gonna take a little ride to the river Ooh let's ride
Let's ride, that's right
Lay a blanket on the ground Ooh let's ride
Kissing and the crickets is the only sound

Red red red red red red redneck Ooh let's ride
And do you wanna get down with a

[Chorus: Blake Shelton, Miranda Lambert, All]
With the boys 'round here
Drinking that ice cold beer
Talkin' 'bout girls, talkin' 'bout trucks
Runnin' them red dirt roads out, kicking up dust
The boys 'round here
Sending up a prayer to the man upstairs
Backwoods legit, don't take no lip
Chew tobacco, chew tobacco, chew tobacco, spit

[Outro: Blake Shelton, Miranda Lambert, All]

Come on through the country side
Ooh let's ride
Down to the river side

[Verse 1]
My oh my, you're so good-looking
Hold yourself together like a pair of bookends
But I've not tasted all your cooking
Who are you when I'm not looking?

Do you pour a little something on the rocks?
Slide down the hallway in your socks?
When you undress, do you leave a path?
Then sink to your nose in a bubble bath?

My oh my, you're so good-looking
Hold yourself together like a pair of bookends
But I've not tasted all your cooking
Who are you when I'm not looking?

[Chorus]
I want to know
I want to know
I want to know

[Verse 2]
Do you break things when you get mad?
Eat a box of chocolates cause you're feeling bad?
Do you paint your toes cause you bite your nails?
Call up mamma when all else fails?

Who are you when I'm not around?
When the door is locked and the shades are down?
Do you listen to your music quietly?
And when it feels just right, are you thinking of me?

[Chorus]
I want to know
I want to know
I want to know

[Outro]
My oh my, you're so good-looking
But who are you when I'm not looking?

[Intro]
Easy, easy, easy, easy
It ain't easy, it ain't easy
Easy, easy, easy...

[Verse 1]
Yeah I used to be alright just saying goodnight
Maybe see you tomorrow
Yeah I could go a couple of days
Just doing my thing
Whatever I wanted
But now, your kisses hit me like lightning
Can’t fight it, girl you put it on me
Yeah you stone me, when you ain’t with me
I ain’t nothing but lonely

[Chorus]
It ain't easy anymore
When I'm walking out your door
My feet drag across the floor
And it just about kills me
I hate picking up my keys
I hate kissing you goodbye
No i ain't gonna lie
With that look in your eyes
And your arms around me
Girl believe me
It ain't easy anymore
No it ain't easy, that's for sure

[Verse 2]
Something different 'bout a Friday night
And the neon lights if you ain't beside me
Now I love it when you call me on the phone
Saying "hurry on home" you got something special on
And it's just for me
Damn you make it hard to leave

[Chorus]
It ain't easy anymore
When I'm walking out your door
My feet drag across the floor
And it just about kills me
I hate picking up my keys
I hate kissing you goodbye
No i ain't gonna lie
With that look in your eyes
And your arms around me
Girl believe me

[Bridge]
It ain't easy leaving my baby in the bed
And driving away knowing the last thing you said
Was "don't go, don't leave, lay here with me"
Girl you're making me crazy
It ain't easy, no, no, no, it ain't easy
It sure ain't baby, yeah baby

[Chorus]
It ain't easy anymore
When I'm walking out your door
My feet drag across the floor
And it just about kills me
I hate picking up my keys
I hate kissing you goodbye
No i ain't gonna lie
With that look in your eyes
And your arms around me
Girl believe me
It ain't easy anymore

[Outro]
No it ain't easy, walking out your door
Mmm, no it ain't easy, no, no
No it ain't easy walking out your door
It ain't easy, oh, it ain't easy

[Verse 1]
Tearing down a dirt road
Rebel flag flying
Coon dog in the back
Truck bed loaded down with beer
And a cold one in my lap
Earnhardt sticker behind my head
And my woman by my side
Tail-pipe's popping
The radio's rocking "Country Boy Can Survive"
If you got a problem with that, ha ha!
You can kiss my country ass

Well, I love Turkey calls, overalls, Wrangler jeans
Smoke nothing but Marlboro reds
Tattoos up & down my arms
And deer heads over my bed
My Granddaddy fought in World War Two
My Daddy went to Vietnam
And I aren’t scared to grab my gun
And fight for my homeland
If you don't love the American flag
You can kiss my country ass

[Chorus]
If you're a down home, backwoods redneck
Hey come on, stand up and raise your glass
But if you aren’t down with my outlaw crowd
You can kiss my country ass. Aw yeah!

[Instrumental break]

Aw yeah

[Verse 2]
Well, there's a whole lot of high-class people out there
That's looking down on me
Cause the country club where I belong
Is the Honky Tonk till three in the morning
Don't wear no fancy clothes
No ties or three piece suits
You can find me in my camouflage cap
My t-shirt and cowboy boots
If that don't fit your social class
You can kiss my country ass

[Chorus]
If you're a down home, backwoods redneck
Hey, come on, stand up and raise your glass
But if you aren’t down with my outlaw crowd
You can kiss my country ass

[Verse 3]
Well I'm a front-porch sitting
Guitar picking, moonshine sipping
Backer juice spitting country boy from the woods
And I love fried chicken & blue gill fishing
And outlaw women, an' I wouldn't change if I could. NO!
I aren’t trying to start no fight, but I'll finish one every time
So you just mind your own damn business
Stay the hell outta mine
If you got a problem with that
You can kiss my country ass

I said if you got a problem with any of that
You can kiss my natural born, Redneck to the bone
Ever-loving country ass

[Verse 1]
Writin' rubber rent checks, livin' on Ramen
Chappin' our ass 'cause we can't afford Charmin
Rockin' that one-ply, one-ply
Shakin' down the couch, find a buffalo nickel
Medium guitar pick, Burger King pickle
Ohh, it's kinda petrified, petrified

[Pre-Chorus]
Dollar's worth of gas didn't even move the needle
Livin' this leave-a-penny, take-a-penny life
Door's unlocked 'cause there's nothin' left to steal
Aw baby doll, that's alright

[Chorus]
Hey girl, got that million dollar kiss
Know just what to do with it
Get me feelin' filthy rich
Hey girl, put that body all on me
Like I hit the lottery
Everything you do to me, honey
That's money
Money, money, money, money
Money, money, money, money

[Verse 2]
Girl, I sure can tell you've been workin' your butt off
The way you're rockin' them secondhand cut-offs
Hmm, can I talk ya into takin' 'em off?
Score a little discount six-pack Keystone
Use the paper sack, twist a little homegrown
Go on and get a Friday night on

[Verse 3]
Girl, one of these days, gonna look back laughin'
Sippin' pomegranate sake at Nobu
But baby, 'til then I'm a have-not havin'
Everything I have's got with you

[Chorus]
Hey girl, got that million dollar kiss
Know just what to do with it
Get me feelin' filthy rich
Hey girl, put that body all on me
Like I hit the lottery
Everything you do to me, honey
That's money
Money, money, money, money
Money, money, money, money

[Pre-Chorus]
Dollar's worth of gas didn't even move the needle
Livin' this leave-a-penny, take-a-penny life
Door's unlocked 'cause there's nothin' left to steal
Aw baby doll, that's alright

[Chorus]
Hey girl, got that million dollar kiss
Know just what to do with it
Get me feelin' filthy rich
Hey girl, put that body all on me
Like I hit the lottery
Everything you do to me, honey
That's money
Money, money, money, money
Money, money, money, money

[Outro]
Money, money, money, money

[Verse 1: Blake Shelton]
Oh man, you've got to watch where you're steppin' around here
Yeah, I got a friend in New York City
He's never heard of Conway Twitty
Don't know nothin' 'bout grits and greens
Never been south of Queens
But he flew down here on a business trip
I took him honky tonkin' and that was it
He took to it like a pig to mud, like a cow to cud

[Chorus: Blake Shelton & Trace Adkins]
We all got a hillbilly bone down deep inside
No matter where you from you just can't hide it
And when the band starts banging and the fiddle saws
You can't help but a hollerin', Yee Haw!
When you see them pretty little country queens
Man you got to admit that's in them genes
Aren’t nothing wrong, just gettin' on your
Hillbilly bone-ba-bone-ba-bone-bone

[Verse 2: Blake Shelton, Trace Adkins, Both]
Nah, you ain’t gotta be born out in the sticks
With an F-150 and a 30-06
Or have a bubba in the family tree
To get on down with me
Yeah, bubba, all you need is an open mind
If it fires you up you got to let it shine
When it feels so right that it can't be wrong
Come on, come on, come on
You ain't alone, you ain't alone

[Chorus: Blake Shelton & Trace Adkins]
We all got a hillbilly bone down deep inside
No matter where you from you just can't hide it
And when the band starts bangin' and the fiddle saws
You can't help but a hollerin' Yee Haw!
When you see them pretty little country queens
Man you got to admit that it's in them genes
Ain’t nothin' wrong, just getting on your
Hillbilly bone-ba-bone-ba-bone-bone

[Instrumental]

[Chorus: Blake Shelton & Trace Adkins]
Come on y'all
We all got a hillbilly bone down deep inside
No matter where you from you just can't hide
And when the band starts bangin' and the fiddle saws
You can't help but a hollerin', Yee Haw!
When you see them pretty little country queens
Man, you got to admit that's in them genes
Aren’t nothing wrong, just getting on your
Hillbilly bone-ba-bone-ba-bone-bone
Hillbilly bone ba-bone ba-bone bone
Hillbilly bone ba-bone ba-bone bone
Hillbilly bone ba-bone ba-bone bone

[Outro: Trace Adkins]
I've always wanted to sing the bone song

[Verse 1]
People would say I'm lying
If I tried to tell 'em how we met tonight
They'd ask how many drinks I'd had
Cause ain't no way it  all went down that right
You waiting on somebody and they never did show
You were pissed off, leaving, came back cause you forgot your phone

[Chorus]
There I was, yeah I just sat down in the seat you left
You walked up I said "what are you doing with your beautiful self?"
You rolled your eyes but you laughed and your song came on
I begged you for a dance and we danced
And it was on, eyes locked, clock stopped
One little kiss, no, we never meant to start falling in love
Oh man, you can't make this up

[Verse 2]
Then I walked you out to your car, it wouldn't start cause you left on your lights
Then you just shook your head and laughed and said "I guess I need a ride"
Then come to find out your house was just a block from mine
Yeah this is one of those movie scene cool kinda things where the stars align
Just an hour ago...

[Chorus]
There I was, yeah I just sat down in the seat you left
You walked up I said "what are you doing with your beautiful self?"
You rolled your eyes but you laughed and your song came on
I begged you for a dance and we danced
And it was on, eyes locked, clock stopped
One little kiss, no, we never meant to start falling in love
Oh man, you can't make this up

[Bridge]
You can’t make up a night like this
You can’t make up a story like that
It’s one of those
How in the world did it happen
Kind of things
I’d never believe it
If I didn’t see it girl

[Chorus]
There I was, yeah I just sat down in the seat you left
You walked up I said "what are you doing with your beautiful self?"
You rolled your eyes but you laughed and your song came on
I begged you for a dance and we danced
And it was on, eyes locked, clock stopped
One little kiss, no, we never meant to start falling in love
Oh man, you can't make this up

[Outro]
You can’t make up a night like this
You can’t make up a story like that
Oh no

[Verse 1]
There's a moment in this journey that I gave up
My boots just couldn't walk another mile
And that cloud above me had no silver linin'
I couldn't buy a break with my last dime
Oh, but when I saw you standin' in the corner
I'da never thought that you would have my back
But then we rolled in like the thunder and the lightenin'
Threw some punches then we had a laugh

[Chorus]
Just some roughed up desperadoes
Hangin' tough through thick and thin
Kickin' up dust wherever we go
I can see that you and me are gonna be friends

[Verse 2]
Who'da thought we'd wind up here together?
It's crazy that we're standin' side by side
Fighting just like two birds of a feather
Who's gonna tell us now that we can't fly?

[Chorus]
Just some roughed up desperadoes
Hangin' tough through thick and thin
Kickin' up dust where ever we go
I can see that you and me are gonna be friends
To the end you and me are gonna be friends

[Bridge]
Yeah, here we go
Hey, hey you and me
Different as different can be
You like to rock, I like to roll
You take the high and I'll take the low
Woah, woah-oh, woah, woah-oh

[Chorus]
Just some roughed up desperadoes
Hangin' tough through thick and thin
Kickin' up dust wherever we go
I can see that you and me are gonna be friends
To the end you and me are gonna be friends

[Outro]
I can see that you and me are gonna be friends, yeah

[Click here to read Blake’s story about “The Baby”]

[Verse 1]
My brother said that I
Was rotten to the core
I was the youngest child
So I got by with more

[Verse 2]
I guess she was tired by
The time I came along
She'd laugh until she cried
I could do no wrong
She would always save me
Because I was her baby

[Verse 3]
I worked a factory in Ohio
A shrimp boat in the Bayou
I drove a truck in Birmingham
Turned 21 in Cincinnati
I called home to mom and daddy
I said "Your boy is now a man"
She said "I don't care if you're 80
You’ll always be my baby"

[Verse 4]
She loved that photograph
Of our whole family
She'd always point us out
For all her friends to see

[Verse 5]
That's Greg he's doing great
He really loves his job
And Ronnie with his 2 kids
How about that wife he's got
And that one's kind of crazy
But that one is my baby

[Verse 6]
I got a call in Alabama
Said come on home to Louisiana
And come as fast as you can fly
Cause your mamma really needs you
And says she's got to see you
She might not make it through the night
The whole way I drove 80
So she could see her baby

[Verse 7]
She looked like she was sleeping
And my family had been weeping
By the time that I got to her side
And I knew that she'd been taken
And my heart it was breaking
I never got to say goodbye

[Outro]
I softly kissed that lady
And cried just like a baby

[Verse 1]
Driving down the interstate
Running thirty minutes late
Singing Margaritaville and minding my own
Some foreign car driving dude with the road rage attitude
Pulled up beside me talking on his cell phone
He started yelling at me like I did something wrong
He flipped me the bird and then he was gone

[Chorus]
Some beach, somewhere
There's a big umbrella casting shade over an empty chair
Palm trees are growing and a warm breezes a blowing
I picture myself right there
On some beach, somewhere

[Verse 2]
I circled the parking lot trying to find a spot
Just big enough I could park my old truck
A man with a big cigar was getting into his car
I stopped and I waited for him to back up
But from out of nowhere a Mercedes Benz
Came cruising up and whipped right in

[Chorus 2]
Some beach, somewhere
There's nowhere to go when you got all day to get there
There's cold margaritas and hot señioritas smiling with long dark hair
On some beach, somewhere

[Verse 3]
I sat in that waiting room
It seemed like all afternoon
The nurse finally said doc's ready for you
You’re not going to feel a thing we'll give you some Novocain
That tooth will be fine in a minute or two
But he stuck that needle down deep in my gum
And he started drilling before I was numb

[Chorus 3]
Some beach, somewhere
There's a beautiful sunset burning up that atmosphere
There's music and dancing and lovers romancing
In the salty evening air
On some beach, somewhere
On some beach, somewhere

[Verse 1]
Without even trying when I close my eyes
I see you walking 'round inside of my head
Looking up at the sky shining brighter than a single sunrise
It's ever burned red

[Pre-Chorus]
And I wanna hold you, hold you
Rolling in the warm sunshine
If I never told you, told you
I'm giving you the rest of my life

[Chorus]
'Cause we got the fire tonight
And it makes me wanna dance with my baby
In the dead of the night
Just keep on moving and grooving 'til the daylight
I'll be right beside you, babe, 'til the end of time

[Verse 2]
I've been bragging about you
Baby, you can bet I've been calling up all of my friends
Don't you know I've been counting down the days?
Feeling just crazy enough to call up your old man

[Pre-Chorus]
And I wanna hold you, hold you
Rolling in the warm sunshine
If I never told you, told you
I'm giving you the rest of my life

[Chorus]
'Cause we got the fire tonight
And it makes me wanna dance with my baby
In the dead of the night
Just keep on moving and grooving 'til the daylight
I'll be right beside you, babe, 'til the end of time

[Instrumental]

[Pre-Chorus]
I wanna hold you, hold you
Rolling in the warm sunshine
And if I never told you, told you
I'm giving you the rest of my life

[Chorus]
'Cause we got the fire tonight
And it makes me wanna dance with my baby
In the dead of the night
Just keep on moving and grooving 'til the daylight
I'll be right beside you, babe, 'til the end of time

[Outro]
I wanna hold you, hold you

[Verse 1]
Ever since you left me
I've been ridin' 'round, cranking up a little country gold heartbreak
Cried and dried these tears
I don't know how much more missin' you I can take

[Pre-Chorus]
I prayed, prayed, prayed
For a sign, sign, sign
Now there it is in the window
It's about time, damn time

[Chorus]
There's a neon light at the end of the tunnel
It ain't all that bright, but even though it's subtle
It's got me feeling alright, go on and make it a double
There's a neon light at the end of the tunnel, tunnel, tunnel

[Verse 2]
I take a shot of I don't care what you're doing now
Chase that one with a cold screw you
When that's done, I just might wash it down
With a big pitcher of someone new

[Pre-Chorus 2]
That blond blonde blonde
At the bar, bar, bar
See if she wants to try and unbreak my heart, heart, heart

[Chorus]
There's a neon light at the end of the tunnel
It ain't all that bright, but even though it's subtle
It's got me feeling alright, go on and make it a double
There's a neon light at the end of the tunnel, tunnel, tunnel

[Verse 3]
When we were together
I thought life would suck forever
Even though I knew better than the pain would never end
They say the night's darkest just before the dawn
Gets kissed by the day break, got down on my knees

[Pre-Chorus]
And I prayed, prayed, prayed
For a sign, sign, sign
Now there it is in the window
It's about time, damn time

[Chorus]
There's a neon light at the end of the tunnel
It ain't all that bright, but even though it's subtle
It's got me feeling alright, go on and make it a double
There's a neon light at the end of the tunnel, tunnel, tunnel

[Verse 1]
I believe kids oughta stay kids as long as they can
Turn off the screen, go climb a tree, get dirt on their hands
I believe we gotta forgive and make amends
'Cause nobody gets a second chance to make new old friends
I believe in working hard for what you've got
Even if it don't add up to a hell of a lot

[Chorus]
I believe most people are good
And most mamas oughta qualify for sainthood
I believe most Friday nights look better under neon or stadium lights
I believe you love who you love
Ain't nothing you should ever be ashamed of
I believe this world ain't half
As bad as it looks
I believe most people are good

[Verse 2]
I believe them streets of gold are worth the work
But I'd still wanna go even if they were paved in dirt
I believe that youth is spent well on the young
'Cause wisdom in your teens would be a lot less fun
I believe if you just go by the nightly news
Your faith in all mankind would be the first thing you lose

[Chorus]
I believe most people are good
And most mamas oughta qualify for sainthood
I believe most Friday nights look better under neon or stadium lights
I believe you love who you love
Ain't nothing you should ever be ashamed of
I believe this world ain't half as bad as it looks
I believe most people are good

[Bridge]
I believe that days go slow and years go fast
And every breath's a gift, the first one to the last

[Chorus]
I believe most people are good
And most Mamas oughta qualify for sainthood
I believe most Friday nights look better under neon or stadium lights
I believe you love who you love
Ain't nothing you should ever be ashamed of
I believe this world ain't half as bad as it looks
I believe most people are good

[Outro]
I believe most people are good
I believe most people are good

[Verse 1]
I got that real good, feel good stuff
Up under the seat of my big black jacked up truck
Rollin' on 35's, pretty girl by my side
You got that sun tan skirt and boots
Waiting on you to look my way and scoot
Your little hot self over here
Girl hand me another beer, yeah!

[Chorus]
All them other boys want to wine you up and take you downtown
But you look like the kind that likes to take it way out
Out where the corn rows grow, row, row my boat
Floatin’ down the Flint River, catch us up a little catfish dinner
Going to sound like a winner, when I lay you down and love you right
Yeah, that’s my kind of night!

[Verse 2]
Might sit down on my diamond plate tailgate
Put in my country right hip-hop mixtape
Little Conway, a little T-Pain, might just make it rain
You can hang your t-shirt on a limb
Hit that bank and we can ease on in
Soak us up a little moonlight
You know I know what you like, yeah!

[Chorus]
All them other boys want to wine you up and take you downtown
But you look like the kind that likes to take it way out
Out where the corn rows grow, row, row my boat
Floatin’ down the Flint River, catch us up a little catfish dinner
Going to sound like a winner, when I lay you down and love you right
Yeah, that’s my kind of night!
Yeah, that’s my kind of night!

[Bridge]
My kinda-- your kind-- is this kind of night
We dance in the dark and your lips land on mine
Oh oh oh oh oh, gonna get our love on
Oh oh oh oh oh, time to get our buzz on

[Chorus]
All them other boys want to wine you up and take you downtown
But you look like the kind that likes to take it way out
Out where the corn rows grow, row, row my boat
Floatin’ down the Flint River, catch us up a little catfish dinner
Going to sound like a winner, when I lay you down and love you right
Yeah, that’s my kind of night!

[Outro]
Yeah, that’s my kind of night!
That’s my kind of night!
Yeah, that’s my kind of night!
Come on

[Verse 1]
She was sittin' all alone over on the tailgate
Tan legs swingin' by a Georgia plate
I was lookin' for her boyfriend
Thinkin', "no way she ain't got one"
Soon as I sat down I was fallin' in love
Tryin' to pour a little sugar in her Dixie cup
Talkin' over the speakers in the back of that truck
She jumped up and cut me off

[Chorus]
She was like, "oh my God, this is my song
I've been listenin' to the radio all night long
Sittin' 'round waitin' for it to come on and here it is"
She was like, "come here, boy, I wanna dance!"
'Fore I said a word, she was takin' my hand
Spinnin' me around till it faded out
And she gave me a kiss
And she said, "play it again, play it again, play it again"
And I said, "play it again, play it again, play it again"

[Verse 2]
I'd gave that DJ my last dime
If he would have played it just one more time
But a little while later
We were sittin' in the drive in my truck
Before I walked her to the door
I was scannin' like a fool AM, FM, XM too
But I stopped real quick when I heard that groove
Man, you should have seen her light up

[Chorus 2]
She was like, "oh my God, this is my song
We've been listenin' to the radio all night long
I can't believe that it came back on, but here it is"
She was like, "come here boy, I wanna dance!"
'Fore I said a word, she was takin' my hand
Spinnin' in the headlights she gave me a goodnight kiss
And I said, "play it again, play it again, play it again"

[Bridge]
And she said, "play it again, play it again, play it again"
The next Friday night we were sittin' out under the stars
You should have seen her smile when I broke out my guitar

[Chorus 3]
She was like, "oh my God, this is my song
I've been listenin' to the radio all night long
Sittin' 'round waitin' for it to come on and here it is"
She was like, "come here boy, I wanna dance!"
'Fore I said a word, she was takin' my hand
Spinnin' in the headlights she gave me a goodnight kiss
And she said, "play it again, play it again, play it again"
And I said, "play it again, play it again, play it again"

[Outro]
Yeah play it again, play it again, play it again
Somebody play it again, play it again, play it again

[Verse 1]
I open my eyes, reach for the phone
Not a word from you baby
It don’t leave my sight since we had that fight
Can’t remember but maybe
I blew you up
In the middle of the night again
You were drinking with your friends
You ignored it but you got it

[Chorus]
I get so neurotic about it baby
‘Cause I know you’re reading your phone
I can’t help from going crazy
Thinking you might not be all alone
I wake up, I check it, I shower and I check it
I feel the buzz in my truck
And I almost wreck it
I always got it on me
Just in case you want me
So, if you’re looking for my love
Then light it up

[Verse 2]
Every time I unlock my screen
I hope I see one of them red lipstick ‘I miss you’ pictures
I’m on your clock, you’re in control
You want me now baby go figure
My worlds at the tips of your fingers

[Chorus]
I get so neurotic about it baby
‘Cause I know you’re reading your phone
I can’t help from going crazy
Thinking you might not be all alone
I wake up, I check it, I shower and I check it
I feel the buzz in my truck
And I almost wreck it
I always got it on me
Just in case you want me
So, if you’re looking for my love
Then light it up
Yeah baby, then light it up

[Chorus]
I go to sleep, I check it
In the middle of the night, I check it
I feel the buzz in my bed
And I don’t get no rest
I always got it on me
Just in case you want me
So, if you’re looking for my love
Then light it up
Yeah baby, light it up

[Verse 1]
Through the dirt and the gravel
Through the years and the miles
Every road that you traveled
Through the tears and the smiles
Through the clear and the muddy
Through the thick and thin
The quiet nights, the howling wind
Through the good and the ugly
The blue and the black
To the ends of the Earth
To the moon and back

[Verse 2]
Through all of the words
The mean and the kind
Through the strings that unravel
And the ties that bind
From the crazy and the different
To the more of the same
From the coast is clear
To a hurricane
Yeah, I'll be right beside you
On a roll or off the tracks
To the ends of the Earth
To the moon and back
To the moon and back

[Verse 3]
Through the bitter and the sweet
The cold and the fire
Lonely cotton sheets
And the burning desire
Until our song is over
Til the stars all fade to black
I'm gonna love you
To the ends of the Earth
To the moon and back
Yeah, I'm gonna love you
All the way to the moon and back
To the moon and back

[Verse 1]
Cottonwood fallin' like snow in July
Sunset, riverside, four wheel drivesiIn a tail light circle
Roll down the windows, turn it on up
Pour a little crown in a dixie cup
Get the party started

[Chorus]
Girl, you make my speakers go boom boom
Dancin' on the tailgate in a full moon
That kinda thing makes a man go mmm hmmm
You're lookin' so good in what's left of those blue jeans
Drip of honey on the money maker gotta be
The best buzz I'm ever gonna find
Hey, I'm a little drunk on you
And high on summertime

[Verse 2]
If you ain't a 10, you're a 9.9
Tippin' n' spillin' that home-made wine
On your tied up T-shirt
Every little kiss is drivin' me wild
Throwin' little cherry bombs into my fire
Good God almighty

[Chorus]
Girl, you make my speakers go boom boom
Dancin' on the tailgate in a full moon
That kinda thing makes a man go mmm hmmm
You're lookin' so good in what's left of those blue jeans
Drip of honey on the money maker gotta be
The best buzz I'm ever gonna find
Hey, I'm a little drunk on you
And high on summertime

[Bridge]
Let's slip on out where it's a little bit darker
And when it gets a little bit hotter
We'll take it off on out in the water

[Chorus]
Girl, you make my speakers go boom boom
Dancin' on the tailgate in a full moon
That kinda thing makes a man go mmm hmmm
You're lookin' so good in what's left of those blue jeans
Drip of honey on the money maker gotta be
The best buzz I'm ever gonna find
Hey, I'm a little drunk on you
And high on summertime

[Outro]
Yeah, I'm a little drunk on you

[Verse 1]
Let it fade to black
Let me run my fingers down your back
Let's whisper, let’s don’t talk
Baby, leave my t-shirt in the hall
Like a needle finds a groove
Baby, we’ll remember what to do
To drown out every distraction
It’s time we made it happen

[Chorus]
Strip it down, strip it down
Back to you and me like it used to be
When it was an old back road with an old school beat
Cowboy boots by your little bare feet
Let it out, tell me right now
Everything I need in them white cotton sheets
Dirty dance me slow in the summertime heat
Feel my belt turn loose from these old blue jeans
We both know that we lost it somehow
Let’s get it found
Strip it down, down, down

[Verse 2]
I wanna drop this cell phone now
And let it shatter on the ground
They ain’t holdin’ nothin’ these two hands
Until they’re holding you again

[Chorus]
Oh, strip it down, strip it down
Back to you and me like it used to be
When it was an old back road with an old school beat
Cowboy boots by your little bare feet
Let it out, tell me right now
Everything I need in them white cotton sheets
Dirty dance me slow in the summertime heat
Feel my belt turn loose from these old blue jeans
We both know that we lost it somehow
Let’s get it found
Strip it down, down, down
Strip it down, down, down

[Bridge]
I don’t wanna let you go
No, not tonight
I just wanna love you so bad, baby
So let's close our eyes

[Chorus]
And strip it down, strip it down
Back to you and me like it used to be
When it was an old back road with an old school beat
Cowboy boots by your little bare feet
Let it out, tell me right now
Everything I need in them white cotton sheets
Dirty dance me slow in the summertime heat
Feel my belt turn loose from these old blue jeans
We both know that we lost it somehow
Let’s get it found
Strip it down, down, down
Strip it down, down, down
Strip it down, down, down
Strip it down, down, down

[Intro]
Kick the dust up, c'mon

[Verse 1]
All week long it’s a farmin’ town
They’re makin’ that money grow
Tractors, plows with flashing lights
Backin’ up a two lane road
They take one last lap around
That sun up high goes down
And then it's on, come on
Girl kick it on back
Z71 like a Cadillac

[Chorus]
We go way out where
There ain’t nobody
We turn this cornfield
Into a party
Pedal to the floorboard
Eight up in a four door
Burnin’ up a back road song
Park it and we pile out
Baby, watch your step now
Better have your boots on
Kick the dust up
Back it on up
Fill your cup up
Let’s tear it up, up
And kick the dust up (kick the dust up...)

[Verse 2]
Bar downtown they got a line
Of people way out the door
$10 dollar drinks, it’s packed inside
I don’t know what they’re waitin for
Got me a jar full of clear
And I got that music for your ears
And it’s like knock, knock, knock goes the diesel
If you really wanna see the beautiful people

[Chorus]
We go way out where
There ain’t nobody
We turn this cornfield
Into a party
Pedal to the floorboard
Eight up in a four door
Burnin’ up a back road song
Park it and we pile out
Baby, watch your step now
Better have your boots on
Kick the dust up
Let's back it on up
Fill your cup up
Let’s tear it up, up
And kick the dust up (c'mon)

[Bridge]
Just follow me down ‘neath the 32 bridge
Y'all be glad you did (kick it)

[Chorus 2]
We go way out where
There ain’t nobody
We turn this cornfield
Into a party
Pedal to the floorboard
Eight up in a four door
Burnin’ up a back road song
Park it and we pile out
Baby watch your step now
Better have your boots on
Kick the dust up
Back it on up
Fill your cup up
That’s what’s up, up
Let’s kick the dust up

[Verse 1]
Fast
That's the kind of car you wanna drive when you're sixteen
Fast
That's the kind of boys that you want on your home team
Fast
Yeah, you think you're gonna catch your big dreams just like that
Fast
And here you are, looking back

[Chorus]
Sixty seconds now feels more like thirty
Tick-tock, won't stop, around it goes
Sand through the glass sure falls in a hurry
All you keep trying to do is slow it down, soak it in
You're trying to make the good times last as long as you can
But you can't, man
It just goes too fast

[Verse 2]
Fast
That's what your parents said when we were falling in love
It's too fast
There ain't no way the two of us were ever going to last
But we did, and here we are, and our only problem is

[Chorus]
Sixty seconds now feels more like thirty
Tick-tock, won't stop, around it goes
Sand through the glass sure falls in a hurry
All you keep trying to do is slow it down, soak it in
You're trying to make the good times last as long as you can
But you can't, man
It just goes too fast

[Bridge]
Looking at you looking out the window right now
Those eyes, that dress, that smile, that laugh
If I could hit pause, I would somehow
But it don't work like that

[Chorus]
Sixty seconds now feels more like thirty
Tick-tock, won't stop, around it goes
Sand through the glass sure falls in a hurry
All you keep trying to do is slow it down, soak it in
You're trying to make the good times last as long as you can
But you can't, man
It goes too fast
It just goes too fast
Way too fast

[Intro]
Woah, woah
Wo-wooah, mmm

[Verse 1]
If I could make a living from walking in the woods
You can bet I'd be sitting pretty good
High on a hill looking at a field downwind
If I could make a nickel off a turning 'em bass
Never worry about the price of gas
I'd be wheeling and dealing and sittin' there reeling 'em in

[Chorus]
Huntin', fishin', and lovin' every day
That's the prayer that a country boy prays
Thank God He made me this way
Huntin', fishin' and lovin' every day
Early in the morning, late in the evening
I'm getting red dirt rich and Flint River paid
Huntin' and fishin' and lovin' every day

[Verse 2]
I'd get a little Farm Pond bus
Sound of gravel when I'm backin' up
Pulling the string on a nine point nine two stroke, mercury
I love it when my baby wants to roll with me
Throws her boots on, climbs in a tree
Tuckin' her hair in my hat and she's ready to go

[Chorus]
We get to huntin', fishin' and lovin' every day
That's the prayer that a country boy prays
Thank God He made me this way
Huntin', fishin' and lovin' every day
Early in the morning, late in the evening
I'm getting red dirt rich, Flint River pay
Huntin' and fishin' and lovin' every day

[Bridge]
So while y'all are up there
Breathin' in that old dirty air
I'll be down here, knee deep, in the Muckalee
Huntin', fishin' and lovin' every day
I wanna see them tall pines sway
Y'all close them eyes
Lets go there in our mind

[Chorus]
Huntin', fishin', and lovin' every day
That's the prayer this country boy prays
Thank God He made me this way
Huntin', fishin' and lovin' every day
Black coffee in the morning, dark whiskey in the evening
I get red dirt rich and Flint River pay
Huntin', and fishin' and lovin' every day
Come on

[Outro]
Won't you come along with me
Won't you come along with me
I know you wanna see
Huntin' and fishin' and lovin' every day
Yeah

[Verse 1: Luke Bryan & Karen Fairchild]
What you doing in this place?
Well, I could probably ask you the same thing
Another round, girl, what you think?
If you're buying, well, you know I'll drink
Some, make it 707
Do you want it on the rocks?
A double shot of heaven
Spilling out the top
And we'll go...

[Chorus: Together (Karen Fairchild)  Luke Bryan]
Shot, for shot, for shot
'Til we forgot what we came here to forget
Ain't a clock, a tick, a tock, that's gonna stop
A night that we won't regret
So put your drink down, throw your camera up
Flip it around and snap a payback picture
(Send it to my ex)
I'll send it to my ex
And send them both a text saying
"We ain't going home alone tonight"
Girl you ain't gotta, I ain't gotta go
Home alone tonight

[Verse 2: Luke Bryan & Karen Fairchild]
Slow country from a cover band
I got you covered if you don't know how to dance
But if you want, we could grab a cab
Girl, we got all night, I got a bottomless tab
So let's go...

[Chorus: Together (Karen Fairchild)  Luke Bryan]
Shot, for shot, for shot
'Til we forgot what we came here to forget
Ain't a clock, a tick, a tock, that's gonna stop
A night that we won't regret
So put your drink down, throw your camera up
Flip it around and snap a payback picture
(Send it to my ex)
I'll send it to my ex
And send them both a text saying
"We ain't going home alone tonight"
Girl you ain't gotta, I ain't gotta go
Home alone tonight

[Bridge: Together (Karen Fairchild) Luke Bryan]
It feels too good to let it end right here
I ain't going home alone tonight
(So, let's not let it end, let it end right here)
Girl, you're going home with me
So let's go...

[Chorus: Together (Karen Fairchild)  Luke Bryan]
Shot, for shot, for shot
'Til we forgot what we came here to forget
Ain't a clock, a tick, a tock, that's gonna stop
A night that we won't regret
So put your drink down, throw your camera up
Flip it around and snap a payback picture
(Send it to my ex)
I'll send it to my ex
And send them both a text saying
"We ain't going home alone tonight"
Girl you ain't gotta, I ain't gotta go
Home alone tonight

[Outro: Together (Karen Fairchild)  Luke Bryan]
(No, I ain't going home alone tonight)
Girl you ain't gotta, I ain't gotta go
Home alone tonight
(Baby, don't let me go home alone )
Home alone tonight

[Verse 1]
When I got the news today
I didn't know what to say
So I just hung up the phone
I took a walk to clear my head
This is where the walking lead
Can't believe you're really gone
Don't feel like going home

[Chorus]
So I'm gonna sit right here
On the edge of this pier
Watch the sunset disappear
And drink a beer

[Verse 2]
Funny how the good ones go
Too soon, but the good Lord knows
The reasons why, I guess
Sometimes the greater plan
Is kinda hard to understand
Right now it don't make sense
I can't make it all make sense

[Chorus]
So I'm gonna sit right here
On the edge of this pier
Watch the sunset disappear
And drink a beer

[Bridge]
So long my friend
'till we meet again
I'll remember you
And all the times that we used to...

[Chorus]
Sit right here
On the edge of this pier
Watch the sunset disappear
And drink a beer
Drink a beer, yeah

[Intro]
Hey girl, go on now
You know you've got everybody looking

[Verse 1]
Got a little boom in my big truck
Gonna open up the doors and turn it up
Gonna stomp my boots in the Georgia mud
Gonna watch you make me fall in love
Get up on the hood of my daddy's tractor
Up on the toolbox, it don't matter
Down on the tailgate, girl I can't wait
To watch you do your thing

[Pre-Chorus]
Shake it for the young bucks sittin' in the honky-tonks
For the rednecks rockin' 'til the break of dawn
For the DJ spinnin' that country song
Come on, come on, come on
Shake it for the birds, shake it for the bees
Shake it for the catfish swimming down deep in the creek
For the crickets and the critters and the squirrels
Shake it to the moon, shake it for me girl, aww

[Chorus]
Country girl, shake it for me girl
Shake it for me girl, shake it for me
Country girl, shake it for me girl
Shake it for me girl, shake it for me

[Verse 2]
Somebody's sweet little farmer's child
With a gattle in her Bud to get a little wild
Pony tail and a pretty smile
Rope me in from a country mile
So come on over here and get in my arms
Spin me around this big ole barn
Tangle me up like grandma's yarn, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
Shake it for the young bucks sittin' in the honky-tonks
For the rednecks rockin' 'til the break of dawn
For the DJ spinnin' that country song
Come on, come on, come on
Shake it for the birds, shake it for the bees
Shake it for the catfish swimming down deep in the creek
For the crickets and the critters and the squirrels
Shake it to the moon, shake it for me girl, aww

[Chorus]
Country girl, shake it for me girl
Shake it for me girl, shake it for me
Country girl, shake it for me girl
Shake it for me girl, shake it for me

[Guitar Break]

[Bridge]
Now dance like a dandelion
In the wind on the hill underneath the pines, yea
Move like the river flows
Feel the kick drum down deep in your toes
All I wanna do is get to holdin' you and get to knowin' you
And get to showin' you and get to lovin' you 'fore the night is through
Baby, you know what to do

[Pre-Chorus]
Shake it for the young bucks sittin' in the honky-tonks
For the rednecks rockin' 'til the break of dawn
For the DJ spinnin' that country song
Come on, come on, come on
Shake it for the birds, shake it for the bees
Shake it for the catfish swimming down deep in the creek
For the crickets and the critters and the squirrels
Shake it to the moon, shake it for me girl, aww

[Chorus]
Country girl, shake it for me girl
Shake it for me girl, shake it for me
Country girl, shake it for me girl
Shake it for me girl, shake it for me
Country girl, shake it for me girl
Shake it for me girl, shake it for me
Country girl, shake it for me girl
Shake it for me girl, shake it for me

[Verse 1]
People talkin' ’bout what is and what ain’t country
What gives ’em the right to wear a pair of beat-up boots?
Is it the size of your tires and your fires, or your wild ass buddies?
Well, give me a minute, let me hit you with some hometown truth

[Pre-Chorus]
You could be a cowboy on the Texas plain
Or a plowboy waitin’ on the rain
We’re all a little different, but we’re all the same
Everybody doin' their own thing

[Chorus 1]
I got my dirt road cred when I was twelve
On a no cab tractor hauling them bales
Backing in boats, fishing limb lines
Running bird dogs through the Georgia pines
Step side cover down in peanut dust
Friday night spotlight, and that was us
It might not have been you, but I can't judge
Just be proud of what makes you country

[Verse 2]
Does it run in your blood?
Did it come from your daddy and mama?
Were you converted by an Alabama song on the radio?
That feels so right
Did you lock eyes with a little green-eyed girl from Jackson?
Tell me what got ya, I just gotta know

[Chorus 2]
Me, I got my Sunday learning in a live oak church
Silver Queen corn in a backyard dirt
Waiting for the fall to finally come along
So I can grab my gun and get my outside on
Step side cover down in peanut dust
Friday night spotlight, and that was us
It might not have been you, but I can't judge
Just be proud of what makes you country

[Brdge]
Might be from a city or a little farm town
Whatever kind of square that you drove around
Do you wear it on your sleeve or keep it deep down?
You know you gotta let it out

[Chorus 1]
I got my dirt road cred back when I was twelve
On a no cab tractor hauling them bales
Backing in boats, fishing limb lines
Running bird dogs through them Georgia pines
Step side cover down in peanut dust
Friday night spotlight, and that was us
It might not have been you, but I ain't judging
And just be proud of what makes you country
Whatever makes you country

[Outro]
You do your kind of country
They doing they kind of country
I do my kind of country
Whatever makes us country

[Verse 1]
Your daddy had a lakehouse
He had me paint it that summer sophomore year
Said I could stay for free
A couple buddies, a couple weeks
You rode in in a little red Honda
And headed straight for the pier
Tank top and cutoff jeans
A little PacSun underneath
Who knew it was 'bout to be

[Chorus]
Sunrise, sunburn, sunset, repeat
Moonlight, all night, crashing into me
Nothing will ever be easy as you and me
Tangled up with nowhere to be
Just sunrise, sunburn, sunset, repeat
Sunrise, sunburn, sunset, repeat, ayy

[Verse 2]
I turned those shutters the color of your eyes
'Til the day turned into night
And took turns with a jar
Turn that boat dock into a bar
And then we passed the guitar around the fire to each other
And watched all of our friends pair off with one another
But we felt like the stars we were under
And everybody knew that that was our summer

[Chorus]
Sunrise, sunburn, sunset, repeat
Moonlight, all night, crashing into me
Nothing will ever be easy as you and me
Tangled up with nowhere to be
Just sunrise, sunburn, sunset, repeat
Yeah

[Bridge]
Whoa
We set July on fire
Whoa
Yeah, girl, you and I were
Sunrise, sunburn, sunset, repeat

[Chorus]
Sunrise, sunburn, sunset, repeat
Moonlight, all night, crashing into me
Nothing will ever be easy as you and me
Tangled up with nowhere to be
Just sunrise, sunburn, sunset, repeat
Sunrise, sunburn, sunset, repeat
Yeah

[Outro]
Whoa
We set July on fire
Whoa
Yeah, girl, you and I were
Sunrise, sunburn, sunset, repeat
Sunrise, sunburn, sunset, repeat

[Verse 1]
This truck needs a half tank
These wheels need a two-lane
This radio needs three songs to play
To get me 'cross town to you
That dress needs to slip off
That hair needs to come down
Friday nights need to do
What Friday nights need to do
That's the truth

[Chorus]
Yeah, birds need bees and ice needs whiskey
Boys like me need girls like you to kiss me
"Fishin' in the Dark" needs Nitty Gritty
Under that pale moon
Sweet tea needs that sugar stirrin'
Small town nights need both ends burnin'
Shades need drawin', hearts need fallin'
Boots need knockin', knockin' boots
Knockin' boots, me and you, oh

[Verse 2]
Long weeks need a weekend
Cheap drinks need a-slingin'
That dance floor needs some me on you
And you on me tonight
Singalongs need to be sung
Tip bells need to be rung
Last calls need a call that cab
And backseats need I want you so bad

[Chorus]
Yeah, birds need bees and ice needs whiskey
Boys like me need the girls like you to kiss me
"Fishin' in the Dark" needs Nitty Gritty
Under that pale moon
Sweet tea needs that sugar stirrin'
Small town nights need both ends burnin'
Shades need drawin', hearts need fallin'
Boots need knockin', knockin' boots
Knockin' boots, girl, me and you

[Bridge]
Doors need shuttin'
Lights need cuttin'
Lips need lockin'
Boots need knockin'

[Chorus]
And birds need bees and ice needs whiskey
Boys like me need the girls like you to kiss me
"Fishin' in the Dark" needs Nitty Gritty
Under that pale moon
Sweet tea needs that sugar stirrin'
Small town nights need both ends burnin'
Shades need drawin', hearts need fallin'
Boots need knockin', knockin' boots
Mmm, knockin' boots, me and you, oh
Knockin' boots

[Verse 1]
It don’t matter what plans I got, I can break ‘em
Yeah, I can turn this thing around at the next red light
And I don’t mind telling all the guys “I can’t meet ‘em”
Hell, we can all go raise some hell any other night
Girl, I don’t care, oh, I just gotta see what you’re wearing
Your hair, is it pulled up or falling down?
Oh, I just have to see it now

[Chorus]
If you wanna call me, call me, call me
You don’t have to worry ‘bout it, baby
You can wake me up in the dead of the night
Wreck my plans, baby that’s alright
This is a drop everything kind of thing
Swing on by I will pour you a drink
The door’s unlocked. I’ll leave on the lights
Baby, you can crash my party anytime

[Verse 2]
Ain’t a spot downtown that’s rockin’ the way that you rock me
Ain’t a bar that can make me buzz the way that you do
I could be on the front row of the best show
And look down and see your face on my phone
And I’m gone so long, hang on. I’ll meet you in a minute or two

[Chorus]
If you wanna call me, call me, call me
You don’t have to worry ‘bout it, baby
You can wake me up in the dead of the night
Wreck my plans, baby that’s alright
This is a drop everything kind of thing
Swing on by I will pour you a drink
The door’s unlocked. I’ll leave on the lights
Baby, you can crash my party anytime

[Bridge]
If it’s two in the morning and you’re feeling lonely
And wondering what I’m doing

[Chorus]
If you wanna call me, call me, call me
You don’t have to worry ‘bout it, baby
You can wake me up in the dead of the night
Wreck my plans, baby that’s alright
This is a drop everything kind of thing
Swing on by I will pour you a drink
The door’s unlocked. I’ll leave on the lights
Baby, you can crash my party anytime
Baby, you can crash my party anytime

[Verse 1]
Girl I know I don’t know you
But your pretty little eyes so blue
Are pulling me in
Like the moon on your skin
I’m so glad you trusted me
To slide up on this dusty seat
And let your hair down
Get out of town

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Got the stars coming out over my hood
And all I know now is it's going good

[Chorus]
You got your hands up
You’re rocking in my truck
You got the radio on
You’re singing every song
I’m set on cruise control
I’m slowly losing hold
Of everything I got
You’re looking so damn hot

[Post-Chorus]
And I don’t know what road we’re on
Or where we’ve been
From staring at you girl
All I know is I don’t want this night to end

[Verse 2]
Going to cuss the morning when it comes
'Cause I know that the rising sun
Ain’t no good for me
'Cause you’ll have to leave
Going to make the most of every mile
Do anything to make your smile
Land on my lips
Get drunk on your kiss

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Clock on the dash says 3:35
There’s plenty of gas and the night’s still alive

[Chorus]
You got your hands up
You’re rocking in my truck
You got the radio on
You’re singing every song
I’m set on cruise control
I’m slowly losing hold
Of everything I got
You’re looking so damn hot

[Post-Chorus]
And I don’t know what road we’re on
Or where we’ve been
From staring at you girl
All I know is I don’t want this night to end

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
You got your hands up
You’re rocking in my truck
You got the radio on
You’re singing every song
I’m set on cruise control
I’m slowly losing hold
Of everything I got
You’re looking so damn hot

[Post-Chorus]
And I don’t know what road we’re on
Or where we’ve been
From staring at you girl
All I know is I don’t want this night to end
I don’t want this night to end
No I don’t want this night to end

[Verse 1]
Baby, what are we becoming?
It feels just like we're always running
Rolling through the motions every day
I could lean in to hold you
Or act like I don't even know you
Seems like you could care less either way
What happened to that girl I used to know?
I just want us back to the way we were before

[Pre-Chorus]
Do I turn you on at all when I kiss you baby?
Does the sight of me wanting you drive you crazy?
Do I have your love? Am I still enough?
Tell me, don't I? Or tell me, do I, baby

[Chorus]
Give you everything that you ever wanted?
Would you rather just turn away and leave me lonely?
Do I just need to give up and get on with my life?
Baby, do I?

[Verse 2]
Remember when we didn't have nothing
But a perfect simple kind of loving?
Baby, those sure were the days
There was a time our love ran wild and free
But now I'm second guessing everything I see!

[Pre-Chorus]
Do I turn you on at all when I kiss you, baby?
Does the sight of me wanting you drive you crazy?
Do I have your love? Am I still enough?
Tell me, don't I? Or tell me, do I, baby

[Chorus]
Give you everything that you ever wanted?
Would you rather just turn away and leave me lonely?
Do I just need to give up and get on with my life?

[Verse 3]
Baby, do I still give you what you need?
Still take your breath away?
Light up the spark way down deep?
Baby, do I?!

[Pre-Chorus]
Whoa! Do I turn you on at all when I kiss you, baby?
Does the sight of me wanting you drive you crazy?
Do I have your love? Am I still enough?
Tell me, don't I? Or tell me, do I, baby

[Chorus]
Give you everything that you ever wanted?
Would you rather just turn away and leave me lonely?
Do I just need to give up and get on with my life?
Tell me baby, do I get one more try? Do I?
Baby, do I?

[Verse 1]
My daddy spent his life looking up at the sky
He'd cuss, kick the dust, saying son it's way too dry
It clouds up in the city, the weather man complains
But where I come from, rain is a good thing

[Hook]
Rain makes corn, corn makes whiskey
Whiskey makes my baby, feel a little frisky
Back roads are bogging up, my buddies pile up in my truck
We hunt our hunnies down, we take them into town
Start washing all our worries down the drain
Rain is a good thing

[Verse 2]
Aren’t nothing like a kiss out back in the barn
Ringing out our soaking clothes, riding out a thunderstorm
When tin roof gets to talking, that's the best love we made
Yeah where I come from, rain is a good thing

[Hook]
Rain makes corn, corn makes whiskey
Whiskey makes my baby, feel a little frisky
Back roads are bogging up, my buddies pile up in my truck
We hunt our hunnies down, we take them into town
Start washing all our worries down the drain
Rain is a good thing

[Bridge]
Farmer Johnson does a little dance
Creeks on the rise, roll up your pants
Country girls, they want to cuddle
Kids out playing in a big mud puddle

[Hook]
Rain makes corn, corn makes whiskey
Whiskey makes my baby, feel a little frisky
Back roads are bogging up, my buddies pile up in my truck
We hunt our hunnies down, we take them into town
Start washing all our worries down the drain
Rain is a good thing

[Outro]
Rain is a good thing
Rain is a good thing
Rain is a good thing

[Verse 1]
I was sitting there, selling turnips on a flat-bed truck
Crunching on a pork rind when she pulled up
She had to be thinking this is where rednecks come from
She had "Hollywood" written on her license plate
She was lost and looking for the Interstate
Needing directions and I was the man for the job

[Chorus]
I told her, "Way up yonder past the caution lights
There's a little country store with an old coke sign
You gotta stop and ask "Miss" Bell
For some of her sweet tea
Then a left will take you to the Interstate
But a right will bring you right back here to me"

[Verse 2]
I was sitting there, thinking about her pretty face
Kicking myself for not catching her name
I threw my hat and thought, "You fool, it could have been love"
I knew my old Ford couldn't run her down
She probably didn't like me anyhow
So I watched her disappear into a cloud of dust

[Chorus]
I told her, "Way up yonder past the caution lights
There's a little country store with an old coke sign
You gotta stop and ask "Miss" Bell
For some of her sweet tea
Then a left will take you to the Interstate
But a right will bring you right back here to me"

[Verse 3]
Is this Georgia heat playing tricks on me
Or am I really seeing what I think I see
The woman of my dreams coming back to me
(Yeah)

[Chorus]
She went way up yonder past the caution light
Don't know why, but something felt right
When she stopped in and asked Miss Bell
For some of her sweet tea
Momma gave her a big ole glass
And sent her right back here to me
Thank God for good directions and turnip greens

[Verse 1]
She had a cross around her neck
And a flower in her hand
That I picked from the side of Thomas Drive
On our way to the sand
We found an old wooden chair
Still warm from the sun
Pushed it back, gave me a kiss with Bacardi on her lips
And I was done

[Chorus 1]
And we spent that week wide open
Upside down beside the ocean
I didn't know where it was goin'
Just tryin' to keep my heart on the tracks
I should've known that kind of feelin'
Would last longer than that week did
Blown away and barely breathin'
Sunday came and it was over
Now she's got me twisted
Like an old beach roller coaster

[Verse 2]
The rest of those days
Turned into long crazy nights
When the music got loud
We'd sneak away from the crowd
Under the boardwalk lights
And with all the things we said
What I just can't get past
Is the way we let it end
Now I'm wonderin' where she is
Knowin' I can't get that goodbye back

[Chorus 1]
And we spent that week wide open
Upside down beside the ocean
I didn't know where it was goin'
Just tryin' to keep my heart on the tracks
I should've known that kind of feelin'
Would last longer than that week did
Blown away and barely breathin'
Sunday came and it was over
Now she's got me twisted
Like an old beach roller coaster

[Bridge]
She's like a song playin' over and over
In my mind, where I still hold her
I had the chance and I should've told her

[Chorus 2]
When we spent that week wide open
Upside down beside the ocean
I should've known where it was goin'
Still tryin' to keep my heart on the tracks
And I should've known that kind of feelin'
Would last longer than that week did
Blown away and barely breathin'
When Sunday came and it was over
Now she's got me twisted
Yeah, I'm still twisted
Like that old beach roller coaster
Like that old beach roller coaster

[Verse 1]
Your mama packed y'all up and moved you to the south
Packed a U-Haul cross a one-tree yard
To a tin roof shotgun house
You didn't know nobody, didn't talk too much
Had a rocking little body with a yankee strut
A little shy side, a little wild side
With your long blonde hair all pulled up
Then you got in with some southern belles
Cut your jeans off with a rebel yell
Learned the talk of the Bible belt
Now, girl, I melt when you

[Chorus]
M-O-V-E, I love it
Yeah, I love it when you get that beat
Boots on, stomp your feet
It's like you've been waiting all week
Move like you do
All sexy and smooth
Like you love to
Oh, girl, look at you
Legs and your hips
Live oak moonlit
When that song hits
Damn, you turn it loose
Stars of the southern sky
Buzz of the fire and ice
DJ plays that throwback tune
But I can't move when you move

[Verse 2]
It's like there's something in the air
That turns you wild when a country song
Is way up loud and the sun goes down
Right about then, you lock eyes on me
You got me where you want me, where I wanna be
All up in the middle of your left and right
Just side to side, yeah, you're right on time when you

[Chorus]
M-O-V-E, I love it
Yeah, I love it when you get that beat
Boots on, stomp your feet
It's like you've been waiting all week
Move like you do
All sexy and smooth
Like you love to
Oh, girl, look at you
Legs and your hips
Live oak moonlit
When that song hits
Damn, you turn it loose
Stars of the southern sky
Buzz of the fire and ice
DJ plays that throwback tune
And I can't move when you move

[Bridge]
Let me talk to you
M-O-V-E
I love it when you, love it when you feel the beat
C-O-M-E
Come on, I wanna see you

[Chorus]
Move like you do
All sexy and smooth
Like you love to
Oh, girl, look at you
Legs and your hips
Live oak moonlit
When that song hits
Damn, you turn it loose
Stars of the southern sky
Buzz of the fire and ice
DJ playing throwback tunes
I wanna move when you
But I can't move when you
No, I can't move when you move
No, I can't move when you move

[Verse 1]
All we do right is make love
And we both know now that ain’t enough

[Chorus]
Ain’t gonna beg you to stay
Ain't gotta ask you what's wrong
Ain’t no reason running after something already gone
Take off your leavin' dress
Let’s do what we do best
I guess everybody’s got their way of moving on
Girl rest your head one more time in my bed
Love me like you loved me when you loved me
And you didn’t have to try
Let’s lay down tonight
And kiss tomorrow goodbye

[Verse 2]
Baby who we are just didn’t work
But maybe we can leave with something out of all this hurt

[Chorus]
Ain’t gonna beg you to stay
Ain’t gotta ask you what’s wrong
Ain’t no reason running after something already gone
Take off your leavin' dress
Let’s do what we do best
I guess everybody’s got their way of moving on
Girl rest your head one more time in my bed
Love me like you loved me when you loved me
And you didn’t have to try
Let’s lay down tonight
And kiss tomorrow goodbye

[Chorus]
Ain’t gonna beg you to stay
Ain’t gotta ask you what’s wrong
Ain’t no reason running after something already gone
Take off your leavin' dress
Let’s do what we do best
I guess everybody’s got their way of moving on
Girl rest your head one more time in my bed
Love me like you loved me when you loved me
And you didn’t have to try
Let’s lay down tonight
And kiss tomorrow goodbye
Let’s kiss tomorrow goodbye

[Verse 1]
It's just a regular Saturday night in the summer
Same guys and girls and the same stars way up in the sky
It's like the music stopped playing when I saw your body
Did you come here with someone or come here to party tonight?

[Chorus]
My little light out of nowhere girl
Where you been all my life?
Where you been trying to hide?
It's like you come
Come from another world
Fell right out of the sky
And landed right here tonight
Do you wanna dance with me?
Any way you gotta be
Do you wanna go somewhere my little out of nowhere girl
My out of nowhere girl

[Verse 2]
Girl are you lost? Are you just here in town for the weekend
All of my life I've been here, never seen you before
If you need someone to show you around, girl I got you
I gotta know you and hold you
I don't wanna leave here alone anymore

[Chorus]
My little light out of nowhere girl
Where you been all my life?
Where you been trying to hide?
It's like you come
Come from another world
Fell right out of the sky
And landed right here tonight
Do you wanna dance with me?
Any way you gotta be
Do you wanna go somewhere my little out of nowhere girl
I just wanna talk to you
Tell me what you wanna do
Yeah we gotta go somewhere
My little out of nowhere girl
Yeah, yeah, yeah

[Bridge]
We could go anywhere you want
Baby I got you
You know I got you
When you walked in this place, you turned it up
Right when I saw you
Baby I saw you

[Chorus]
My little light out of nowhere girl
Where you been all my life?
Where you been trying to hide?
It's like you come
Come from another world
Fell right out of the sky
And landed right here tonight
Do you wanna dance with me?
Any way you gotta be
Do you wanna go somewhere my little out of nowhere girl
I just wanna talk to you
Tell me what you wanna do
Yeah we gotta go somewhere
My little out of nowhere girl

[Outro]
My out of nowhere girl
My out of nowhere girl
Out of nowhere girl

[Verse 1: Bryan]
Hungover in a hotel room
Cell phone's dead
You're stretched out next to me
Lost somewhere in a dark whiskey dream
Hungover in a hotel room
Call the concierge
Two bloody mary's and some cigarettes
So you can wake up to breakfast in bed
Hear your voice in my head

[Pre-Chorus: Weisband]
Hey, when you gonna come pick me up?
You always say we're gonna burn it down
If you want it baby, call me back
Call me back, maybe we can hang out

[Chorus: Bryan and Weisband]
Then it was room 704, hang a sign on the door
Gucci falling on the floor with the lights down low
Dancing in the dark, body killing me
Throwing off sparks
Lay it back baby, anything goes
Spent the whole night last night all messed up, making love
Girl, I swear I've never felt this good
Waking up hungover in a hotel room

[Verse 2: Bryan]
Slide the curtains back
Light up the morning on the balcony
Look at you stirring in the shadows and sheets
Last night on repeat

[Pre-Chorus: Weisband]
Hey, when you gonna come pick me up?
You always say we're gonna burn it down
If you want it baby, call me back
Call me back, maybe we can hang out

[Chorus: Bryan and Weisband]
Then it was room 704, hang a sign on the door
Gucci falling on the floor with the lights down low
Dancing in the dark, body killing me
Throwing off sparks
Lay it back baby, anything goes
Spent the whole night last night all messed up, making love
Girl, I swear I've never felt this good
Waking up hungover in a hotel room

[Bridge: Bryan]
There's that smile driving me wild
Call the front desk, late check out request
You know, better yet, book it for another night

[Chorus: Bryan and Weisband]
Room 704, hang a sign on the door
Gucci falling on the floor with the lights down low
Dancing in the dark, body killing me
Throwing off sparks
Lay it back baby, anything goes
Spent the whole night last night all messed up, making love
Girl, I swear I've never felt this good
Waking up hungover in a hotel room

[Outro: Bryan and Weisband]
Oh, hungover in a hotel room
Yeah, yeah
Hungover in a hotel room

[Verse 1]
Sun coming up through the blinds on your pretty face
I'm just laying in these tangled sheets, watching you walk away
We been deep in love, all messed up, and everything in between
From fly to fall, we tried it all
Girl, we been a lot of things

[Chorus]
But baby, we ain't never been
Baby, we ain't never been bad lovers
Love, we can laugh it off
We both know we're better off, under covers
Yeah, we might not string all the good times together
But one thing's certain, not one time never, no
Baby, we ain't never been
Baby, we ain't never been bad lovers
Not one time, baby

[Verse 2]
Weather man calling for rain on Saturday
Girl, what you got goin' on, your place or my place?
When its tapping on the roof, ain't nothing like you
Doing what you do to me
When the lightning hits, I'll be kissing on your lips
Girl, the rest is history

[Chorus]
Baby, we ain't never been
Baby, we ain't never been bad lovers
Love, we can laugh it off
We both know we're better off, under covers
Yeah, we might not string all the good times together
But one thing's certain, not one time never, no
Baby, we ain't never been
Baby, we ain't never been bad lovers
No, no, no, no, no, no

Baby, we ain't never been
Baby, we ain't never been bad lovers
Baby, we ain't never been
Baby, we ain't never been bad lovers
Love, we can laugh it off
We both know we better off, under covers
Yeah. we might not string all the good times togeher
But one thing's certain, not one time never, no
Baby, we ain't never been
We ain't never been bad lovers
Baby, we ain't never been
Baby, we ain't never been bad lovers
No, no, no

[Verse 1]
First time I tied a plastic worm and felt him on the other end
It was get the net, get him in the boat
Yeah buddy, I was hooked on it
First time I heard Chattahoochee on the speakers of my radio
I was topping off the tank on my old two-tone
I was hooked on it
Ha-ha!

[Chorus]
Hooked on the feeling of a summer in the south
Hooked on the dust flying up from a plow
Hooked on them blue eyes, hair falling down
Hooked on her then, still hooked on her now
So many things where I grew up
Once you get a little, you can't get enough
This small town life runs through my blood
And I'm hooked on it

[Verse 2]
The first time I got that Gulf Coast white sugar sand on my feet
Saw the sunshine dancing on that clear blue water
I was hooked on it
First time I pulled me a long neck bottle from the bottom of a bucket of ice
As soon as that cold beer hit my lips, I was hooked on it

[Chorus]
Hooked on the feeling of a summer in the south
Hooked on the dust flying up from a plow
Hooked on them blue eyes, hair falling down
Hooked on her then, still hooked on her now
So many things where I grew up
Once you get a little, you can't get enough
This small town life runs through my blood
And I'm hooked on it
Come on!

[Bridge]
Like a Friday payday honky tonk buzz
I gotta have a little more of it just because
I keep coming back to the good stuff, 'cause I'm hooked on it

[Chorus]
Hooked on the feeling of a summer in the south
Hooked on the dust flying up from a plow
Hooked on them blue eyes, hair falling down
Hooked on her then, still hooked on her now
So many things where I grew up
Once you get a little, you can't get enough
This small town life's all in my blood
And I'm hooked on it
Yeah, I'm hooked on it
I'm hooked on it

[Verse 1]
You know the one where you call
But you act like you never called me
When you see me at a bar and you act like you never saw me
When you're dancin' with him, and you're lookin' at me
Or I'm holdin' her, and I'm hopin' you see
Or the one where you don't kiss me
Then you tell me that you miss me

[Chorus]
All of these games, we play
I can't even keep 'em all straight
Do we mean what we say?
We got lines crossed all over the place, yeah
I can't tell if I'm winnin' or losin'
Somebody tell me, what are we doin'?
Nobody ever comes out on top
Tell me, are we ever gonna stop?
Playin' these games

[Verse 2]
The one where you act all surprised
Like you didn't know I'd be at the party
The way you make sure it gets back to me
That you got with somebody
The way you wake up, say it was just a mistake
But you always leave something over at my place
So I gotta bring it back
Now baby why you gotta be like that

[Chorus]
All of these games, we play
I can't even keep 'em all straight
Do we mean what we say?
We got lines crossed all over the place, yeah
I can't tell if I'm winnin' or losin'
Somebody tell me, what are we doin'?
Nobody ever comes out on top
Tell me, are we ever gonna stop?
Playin' these games

[Bridge]
This break-up, make-up, hot and cold thing got me dizzy
You don't want me til I got somebody with me
It's gonna kill me
Baby tell me
What am I supposed to do with you?

[Chorus]
And all of these games, we play
I can't even keep 'em all straight
Do we mean what we say?
We got lines crossed all over the place, yeah
I can't tell if I'm winnin' or losin'
Somebody tell me what are we doing
Nobody ever comes out on top
Tell me, are we ever gonna stop?
Playin' these games
All of these games

[Verse 1]
Roll in the bar, me and my crew
Their little plan to get me over you
They're hookin’ me up, yeah
Buyin’ me drinks with a thousand girls
There's just one thing

[Chorus]
I can't go anywhere, I can't do anything
No, I can't close my eyes without you in my dreams
You won't leave me alone, even though I know you're gone
I look around for someone new, but I see you
Jumpin’ up there with the band
Takin’ me by the hand
Hey boy, come dance with me
Stuck like a melody in my head
In the bed of my truck
By the light of the midnight moon
Baby, I see you

[Verse 2]
Don't know what you did, but you done it good
You don't know how bad that I wish I could
Delete you from my phone, find a girl and take her home
But there's just one thing wrong

[Chorus]
I can't go anywhere, I can't do anything
No, I can't close my eyes without you in my dreams
You won't leave me alone, even though I know you're gone
I look around for someone new, but I see you
Jumpin’ up there with the band
Takin’ me by the hand
Hey boy, come dance with me
Stuck like a melody in my head
In the bed of my truck
By the light of the midnight moon
Baby, I see you

[Bridge]
Your lips, your eyes
Girl, since you told me goodbye

[Chorus]
I can't go anywhere, I can't do anything
No, I can't close my eyes without you in my dreams
You won't leave me alone, even though I know you're gone
I look around for someone new, but I see you
Jumpin’ up there with the band
Takin’ me by the hand
Hey boy, come dance with me
Stuck like a melody in my head
In the bed of my truck
By the light of the midnight moon
Baby, I see you

[Outro]
Baby, I see you
Baby, I see you

[Verse 1]
It's five o'clock, so we're drinking again
Wearing flip flops, so we're drinking again
There's a jukebox, so we're drinking again
We're all drinking again
The suns out, so we're drinking again
Somebody bought a round, so we're drinking again
But we're all here and we got cold beer
And we're all drinking again

[Chorus]
We'll be laughing and lovin', high fivin' and huggin'
Pop top and long neck and honky tonk friends
We're all drinking again

[Verse 2]
The bartender's pretty so we're drinking again
Thinking kinda dirty so we're drinking again
It's past beer 30, so we're drinking again
We're all drinking again
Just got paid, so we're drinking again
Here comes the shot tray, so we're drinking again
Got a ride home and the bar ain't closed
So we're all drinking again

[Chorus]
We'll be laughing and lovin', high fivin' and huggin'
Pop top and long neck and honky tonk friends
We're all drinking again

[Verse 3]
Our team's playing, so we're drinking again
Cars are racin', so we're drinking again
I guess we're staying, so we're drinking again
We're all drinking again
It's two for one, so we're drinking again
It sure is fun, so we're drinking again
The girls are friendly and this one's empty
So we're all drinking again

[Chorus]
We'll be laughing and lovin', high fivin' and huggin'
Pop top and long neck and honky tonk friends
We're all drinking again
Yeah, we're all drinking again
How 'bout another one? We're all drinking again

[Spoken Outro]
Nobody wants to leave
Somebody put it on my card
Declined? Alright, here's another
Alright
How'd we wind up here?
Who brought us here?
Same time, same place tomorrow!

[Verse 1]
Running kind of late, got her makeup half on
Touch it up good enough
Oh, whatever
All her girlfriends waiting outside on her
They've been blowing up her phone
Girl come on, get yourself together
Got her hands up, she's so ready with her driver on the way
Skips the damn line, she ain't even gotta pay

[Chorus]
She starts feeling the buzz about shot one
Hips starts swaying when the DJ drops one
She's in against the law, call the cops one
She might be a mess but she's a hot one
With her little jeans and white tee
She might rev up an old boy's heart or even stop one
Putting on a show tonight, letting go tonight
She might be a mess, but she's a hot one

[Verse 2]
She's dancing like every guy in here ain't watching her
Do her thang, make it rain
God to mighty
She's breaking necks, got them spilling beer
Putting that bartender through a year or two of Junior college
She's about to get them Dolce Vita's on the bar
It's all but all over the minute she starts

[Chorus]
Feeling the buzz about shot one
Hips starts swaying when the DJ drops one
She's in against the law, call the cops one
She might be a mess but she's a hot one
With her little jeans and white tee
She might rev up an old boy's heart or even stop one
Putting on a show tonight, letting go tonight
She might be a mess, but she's a hot one

[Bridge]
Like the summer heat where she comes from
She's burning me down
Just look at her now
Just look at her now
(She's so hot)
(She's so hot)
(She's so hot)

[Chorus]
She starts feeling the buzz about shot one
Hips starts swaying when the DJ drops one
She's in against the law, call the cops one
Yeah, she might be a mess but she's a hot one
With her little jeans and white tee
She might rev up an old boy's heart or even stop one
Putting on a show tonight, letting go tonight
She might be a mess, but she's a hot one

[Verse 1]
You're not looking for anything more than a
Good time and an open door
A good band and a dance floor
Then she walks in
You got a pickup line to throw, but
She walks up and says "hello"
Before you can even let it go
She's got you reeled in

[Pre-Chorus]
You can't escape it if you wanted to
You don't know what you got yourself into

[Chorus]
You're blindfolded yo
Walking south down the whiskey tracks
She's rolling north like a neon train
Bolt of lightning in the night
Speed of light, you won't realize
You've been struck 'til you see the flame
Her smile'll slice you to the heart
There you are in the back of a bar
Bleeding, but you feel no pain
She won't cut you like a knife, like a knife
That little look in her eyes'll
Cut you like a razor blade
You wait

[Verse 2]
You ain't used to playing by these rules
So you sit there and try to play it cool
Do your best not to play the fool
But it's too late now
You wanna see how far she'll let you go
She'll let you think you're in control

[Chorus]
You're blindfolded
Walking south down the whiskey tracks
She's rolling north like a neon train
Bolt of lightning in the night
Speed of light, you won't realize
You been struck 'til you see the flame
Her smile'll slice you to the heart
There you are in the back of a bar
Bleeding, but you feel no pain
She won't cut you like a knife, like a knife
That little look in her eyes'll
Cut you like a razor blade

[Bridge]
You can't escape it if you wanted to
You don't know what you got yourself into

[Chorus]
You're blindfolded
Walking south down the whiskey tracks
She's rolling north like a neon train
Bolt of lightning in the night
Speed of light, you won't realize
You been struck 'til you see the flame
Her smile'll slice you to the heart
There you are in the back of a bar
Bleeding, but you feel no pain
She won't cut you like a knife, like a knife
That little look in her eyes'll
Cut you like a razor blade
She won't cut you like a knife, like a knife
That little look in her eyes'll
Cut you like a razor blade
Cut you like a razor blade
She cut you like a razor blade

[Verse 1]
Bandit was a black lab, Daddy brought home
He said, "Son he's yours from now on"
Bandit looked at me and he cocked his head
Slept at night on the foot of my bed
All that year, I can see him still
Chasing after me, nipping at my heels
Down to the bus stop, my new best friend
Still waiting right there when I got home again

[Chorus]
And I thought we would be together
Go on and on just like that, forever
But I was young back then
I guess I just didn't know
Little boys grow up and dogs get old

[Verse 2]
He was my sidekick through thick and thin
And he'd bark at my fish when I'd reel 'em in
Summers came and went and we grew like weeds
And I don't know if I raised him or he raised me

[Chorus]
And I thought we would be together
Go on and on just like that, forever
But I was young back then
How was I supposed to know
Little boys grow up and dogs get old

[Bridge]
He was fourteen when I left for Tennessee
And he came down the front porch steps a little slow
I got down to hug his neck
Said "you take care of Mom and Dad, 'til I get home"
"And be a good boy"
"Now you be a good boy"

[Chorus]
And I thought we would be together
Go on and on just like that, forever
But I was young back then
God I wish I didn't know
Little boys grow up and dogs get old

[Verse 1]
Ain't no doors and no windows
Just a roll bar and a radio
If it rains you're gonna get wet
But that old 302 ain't let me down yet

[Pre-Chorus 1]
It's a cutout picture of the 70's
When everything felt so free

[Chorus]
It's yellow and a little bit of rust
Looking good for 42 years young
Ten sets of tires, a hundred bonfires
And it can still light up a backroad
It was built for a day like this
A clear blue sky and a white sand kiss
It's three on the tree and geared down for going slow
My ol' Bronco

[Verse 2]
I flipped it over up on Arnold Hill
Turned it back over and fixed the grill
You know where I been by that old oil spot
Most times it's in the beach bar parking lot

[Pre-Chorus 2]
No it ain't hard to pick me out
Cause it's the only one in this town

[Chorus]
It's yellow and a little bit of rust
Looking good for 42 years young
Ten sets of tires, a hundred bonfires
And it can still light up a backroad
It was built for a day like this
A clear blue sky and a white sand kiss
It's three on the tree and geared down for going slow
No, I ain't gonna ever let her go
My ol' Bronco

[Outro]
Yeah it's yellow and a little bit of rust
Looking good for 42 years young
Ten sets of tires, a hundred bonfires
And it can still light up a backroad
It was built for a day like this
A clear blue sky and a white sand kiss
It's three on the tree and geared down for going slow
No I ain't gonna ever let her go
My ol' Bronco
My ol' Bronco

[Verse 1]
It flows underneath the 32 bridge
And cuts through the heart of South Georgia
Big copperheads and mean wild pigs
And gators in the weeds waiting for ya
I leave my phone in the truck
I leave my truck at the road
My four-wheeler gets me where I wanna go
I leave the world behind
I pull my hat down low
Get back to my roots, by a full moon glow

[Hook]
I got an old Jon boat that I stowed down there
On them hot summer nights when I get a-wild hare
I got a moonshine stash in a cypress stump
And a catfish line going - bump bump
An old tractor tire where I sit by the fire
And drink to a sweet swamp song
So if you're looking for me, don't even bother
When I dip my feet in that Muckalee Creek water

[Verse 2]
Daddy brought me down here when I was a kid
Taught me how to bait a craw fish basket
From the time I was old enough to walk
He had me running down squirrels and rabbits
I feel right at home in this neck of the woods
If this was all I had, I'd be living good
So let the stock market do what it's gonna do
Let the dollar go down and gas over the roof

[Hook]
I got an old Jon boat that I stowed down there
On them hot summer nights when I get a-wild hare
I got a moonshine stash in a cypress stump
And a catfish line going - bump bump
An old tractor tire where I sit by the fire
And drink to a sweet swamp song
So if you're looking for me, don't even bother
When I dip my feet in that Muckalee Creek water

[Bridge]
I'm free, and I'm me
Being everything that I wanna be
Nobody jacking with me
No sign of the city lights
Hell with the city lights!

[Hook]
I got an old Jon boat that I stowed down there
On them hot summer nights when I get a-wild hare
I got a moonshine stash in a cypress stump
And a catfish line going - bump bump bump
An old tractor tire where I sit by the fire
And drink to a sweet swamp song
So if you're looking for me, don't even holler
When I get down deep in that Muckalee Creek water

That Muckalee Creek water

[Verse 1]
I got smoke in my hair
My clothes thrown everywhere
Woke up in my rocking chair
Holding a beer in my hand
Sporting a neon tan

[Verse 2]
My stereo cranked up
I can't find my truck
How'd I get home from the club
Ain't got a clue what went down
So I started calling around

[Chorus]
And all my friends say
I started shooting doubles
When you walked in
All my friends say
I went a little crazy
Seeing you with him
You know I don't remember a thing
But they say I sure was raising some cain
I was a rock star, party hard
Getting over you comeback kid
Yay I must have did
What all my friends say
Yeah, Yeah, Yeah

[Verse 3]
I found my billfold
I cried oh no no
Good time Charlie got me now I'm broke
But it was worth acting like a fool
Yeah girl I must have really showed you

[Chorus]
Cause all my friends say
I started shooting doubles
When you walked in
All my friends say
I went a little crazy
Seeing you with him
You know I don't remember a thing
But they say I sure was raising some cain
I was a rock star, party hard
Getting over you comeback kid
Yay I must have did
What all my friends say
Yeah, Yeah, Yeah

[Bridge]
I was Elvis rocking on the bar
Working the crowd pouring out my heart

[Chorus]
And all my friends say
I started shooting doubles
When you walked in
All my friends say
I went a little crazy
Seeing you with him
You know I don't remember a thing
But they say I sure was raising some cain
I was a rock star, party hard
Getting over you comeback kid
Yay I must have did
What all my friends say
Yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse 1]
I watch you tell everyone
That she is your only one
But I see the other side
Know all the things you try to hide
Man, you put you up a real good front
You thinking you've got everyone
But you ain't got me fooled
I see right through

[Chorus]
If you love her like you say you do
Then why don't you love her like you say you do
'Cause I wanna love her like you say you do
If you ain't gonna treat her right
Then don't make her lie awake another night
Waitin' on another dream that just ain't comin' true
If you ain't gonna love her like you say you do
Then I wanna love her like you say you do

[Verse 2]
Think you go as simple as you walk away
There ain't too much you even gotta say
You don't have to hurt her anymore
It's just a turnin' of a door
And don't you worry about bein' gone
'Cause she won't want for nothing too long
'Cause I see what you couldn't see
And I wanna be what you wouldn't be

[Chorus]
If you love her like you say you do
Then why don't you love her like you say you do
'Cause I wanna love her like you say you do
If you ain't gonna treat her right
Then don't make her lie awake another night
Waitin' on another dream that just ain't comin' true
If you ain't gonna love her like you say you do
Then I wanna love her like you say you do

[Outro]
If you ain't gonna treat her right
Then don't make her lie awake another night
Waitin' on another dream that ain't comin' true
If you ain't gonna love her like you say you do
Then I wanna love her like you say you do
No, no, no
If you ain't gonna love her like you say you do
Then I wanna love her like you say you do
I wanna love her, I wanna love her, I wanna love her
Like you say you do
I wanna love her, I wanna love her
Like you say you do

[Verse 1]
Mercy
Why you gotta show up lookin' so good just to hurt me?
Why you wanna stop this whole damn world from turning?
Mercy
Why you hanging on so tight if this ain't working?
Why you wanna stop this flame if it's still burning?
Cause it's still burning

[Chorus]
So if you're gonna break my heart, just break it
And if you're gonna take your shot, then take it
Take it
If you made up your mind, then make it
But make this fast
If you ever loved me
Have mercy

[Verse 2]
If you go out tonight and get drunk and lonely
Wind up home alone please don't call me
And say you miss me, no

[Chorus]
So if you're gonna break my heart, just break it
And if you're gonna take your shot, then take it
Take it
If you made up your mind, then make it
But make this fast
If you ever loved me
Have mercy

[Bridge]
Woah
Oh have mercy

[Chorus]
If you're gonna break my heart, just break it
If you're gonna take your shot, take it
Take it
Oh if you're gonna break my heart, just break it
And if you're gonna take your shot, then take it
Take it
If you made up your mind, then make it
But make this fast
If you ever loved me
Mmmh if you ever loved me
Have mercy
Oh have mercy
Oh have mercy
Have mercy

[Verse 1]
I can't count the times
I almost said what's on my mind
But I didn't
Just the other day
I wrote down all the things I'd say
But I couldn't
I just couldn't

[Pre-Chorus]
Baby, I know that you've been wondering
Mmm, so here goes nothing

[Chorus]
In case you didn't know
Baby, I'm crazy bout you
And I would be lying if I said
That I could live this life without you
Even though I don't tell you all the time
You had my heart a long long time ago
In case you didn't know

[Verse 2]
The way you look tonight
That second glass of wine
That did it
There was something 'bout that kiss
Girl it did me in
Got me thinking
I'm thinking

[Pre-Chorus]
One of the things that I've been feeling
Mmm, it's time you hear em

[Chorus]
In case you didn't know
Baby, I'm crazy bout you
And I would be lying if I said
That I could live this life without you
Even though I don't tell you all the time
You had my heart a long long time ago
In case you didn't know

[Bridge]
You've got all of me
I belong to you
Yeah you're my everything

[Chorus]
In case you didn't know
I'm crazy bout ya
I would be lying if I said
That I could live this life without you
Even though I don't tell you all the time
You had my heart a long long time ago
Yeah, you had my heart a long long time ago
In case you didn't know
In case you didn't know

[Verse 1]
Hmm, if ever I get lost in your eyes tonight
Please just let me stay right there a little bit longer
Underneath the stars, we are on fire
And I don't wanna go if you don't wanna go

[Chorus]
We can just stay here in this minute
Lose all track of time
Let the world spin on without us for a while
I'm tellin' you, we're just one kiss away from heaven
So baby, hold on tight
'Cause I want to get wrapped up in your love
So baby, let's just stay here tonight, tonight

[Verse 2]
I just wanna linger like this on your lips
And taste the salt air on your skin
Hold you in my hands
Anything and everything, you know that I'm all in

[Chorus]
We can just stay here in this minute
Lose all track of time
Let the world spin on without us for a while
I'm tellin' you, we're just one kiss away from heaven
So baby, hold on tight
'Cause I want to get wrapped up in your love
So baby, let's just stay here tonight, tonight
Baby, let's just stay here tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight, yeah
Oh, let's just stay right here tonight

[Bridge]
'Cause I don't wanna go if you don't wanna go
We can just stay here in this minute
Lose all track of time
Let the world spin on without us for a while

[Chorus]
I'm tellin' you, we're just one kiss away from heaven
So baby, hold on tight
'Cause I want to get wrapped up in your love
So baby, let's just stay here tonight, tonight
Baby, let's just stay here tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight, whoa

[Verse 1]
Would've thought you wrote down every word
Goodbye spelled out like it had been rehearsed
There ain't no point in trying to change your mind

[Pre-Chorus]
Seems like
You've got it all figured out
You're alright
With the way this is going down

[Chorus]
Don't tell me we can still be friends
Hanging on the weekend
You're gonna be okay if I start seeing somebody new
You hope that I do
It won't be long
Till I forget to call every time that I'm drinking
And you ain't the love song
I can't keep from singing
I gotta be honest
If you really believe that's the truth
You never loved me like I loved you

[Verse 2]
By the way you're talking you would think
You never had any real feelings for me
And if you think I can look across the bar

[Pre-Chorus]
And see you
In someone else's arms
And I need you
Oh who do you think you are?

[Chorus]
Trying to tell me we can still be friends
Hanging on the weekend
You're gonna be okay if I start seeing somebody new
You hope that I do
It won't be long
Till I forget to call every time that I'm drinking
And you ain't the love song
I can't keep from singing
I gotta be honest
If you really believe that's the truth
You never loved me like I loved you

[Bridge]
You always told me
You'd never leave me
You said I was your one and only
So what makes you think I wanna hear you say
We can still be friends
No, I don't wanna be friends
Stop telling me, stop telling me, woah

[Chorus]
That we can still be friends
Hanging on the weekend
You're gonna be okay if I start seeing somebody new
You hope that I do
It won't be long
Till I forget to call every time that I'm drinking
And you ain't the love song
I can't keep from singing
I gotta be honest
You really believe that's the truth
You never loved me like I loved you
You never loved me like I loved you
You never loved me like I loved you

[Verse 1]
I wasn't tryna feel like this
I wasn't tryna feel nothin' at all
I just came to meet my friends
And try to drink a long week off
I didn't want to stay too late
I wasn't tryna close it down
I was doin' my own thing
Yeah, up until you sat down

[Chorus]
I thought that I'd
Catch a buzz, catch a game
Catch up with the boys, the same old thing
Catch a cab back to my place
But then I saw your face
Now you got me tryna
Catch your eye, catch your name
Catch a spark and start a flame
The way you smile and I can't help myself
Girl, you got me tryna catch my breath
You got me tryna catch my breath, yeah

[Verse 2]
You got me doin' double-takes
You went and messed up all my plans
I only meant to hold this drink
Now I'm tryna hold your hand

[Chorus]
Yeah, I thought that I'd
Catch a buzz, catch a game
Catch up with the boys, the same old thing
Catch a cab back to my place
But then I saw your face
Now you got me tryna
Catch your eye, catch your name
Catch a spark and start a flame
The way you smile and I can't help myself
Girl, you got me tryna catch my breath, whoa
Ooh, you got me tryna catch my breath, whoa

[Bridge]
You got me catchin' feelin's
I wasn't even tryna feel this
I don't know how you started stealin'
My heart like you are in this bar
But I'm glad that you are

[Chorus]
'Cause I just thought that I'd
Catch a buzz, catch a game
Catch up with the boys, the same old thing
Catch a cab back to my place
But then I saw your face
Now you got me tryna
Catch your eye, catch your name
Catch a spark and start a flame
The way you smile and I can't help myself
Girl, you got me tryna catch my breath, oh
You got me tryna catch my breath, yeah
Ooh, you got me tryna catch my breath, whoa
You got me tryna catch my breath, whoa

How does it feel to know
That I can't get you off my mind
Oh I can try
But you get inside my head
And that would be just fine if I knew
What I was to you

Am I forgettable
Is mine the name that ties your tongue
Or am I memorable
Is there a chance I could be the one
Have I changed anything
Is there a place you keep for me
What have I become to you
Define me. Define me

What am I supposed to do
Im scared of reaching out to you
To have you pull away
Im not afraid of letting go
But it would sure be nice to know
The right card to play

Am I forgettable
Is mine the name that ties your tongue
Or am I memorable
Is there a chance I could be the one
Have I changed anything
Is there a place you keep for me
What have I become to you
Define me. Define me

And I
Have waited ever patiently
And I
Have come up with a few simple things
That you
Could say to reassure me that youre mine
One last time

Am I forgettable
Is mine the name that ties your tongue
Or am I memorable
Is there a chance I could be the one
Have I changed anything
Is there a place you keep for me
What have I become to you
Define me. Define me

Am I forgettable
Is mine the name that ties your tongue
Or am I memorable
Is there a chance I could be the one
Have I changed anything
Is there a place you keep for me
What have I become to you
Define me. Define me

[Verse One]
When your vision fades to black and white
Cause your day hasn't gone quite right
Just remember I am never far
It doesn't matter where you are
Just reach your hands into the night
And see I've never left your side
Just like I swore so many times

[Chorus]
Just because you're gone
Doesn't mean that I've moved on
I still love you just the same
I still crumble at your name
Because the love you make me feel
Is the only thing that's real
And I need you to be alright
I'm forever yours to hold
Oh, as long as I have a life

[Verse Two]
When everything you know
Starts to let you down
And your world starts spinning round
I'll be the place where you can sleep
Cause in my heart you'll always be
More than a friend
More than time well spent
You show me who I'm supposed to be
And that makes you deserving

[Repeat Chorus]

[Bridge]
As long as I breathe
As long as I need
As long as I'm me
Oh, I belong to you
As long as I'm free
And as far as I see
If my heart still beats
Oh, then it beats for you

[Chorus Two]
Just because you're gone
Doesn't mean that I've moved on
I still love you just the same
I still crumble at your name
Because the love you make me feel
Is the only thing that's real
And I need you to be alright
Oh, just because you're gone
Doesn't mean that I've moved on
I still love you just the same
I still crumble at your name
Because the love you make me feel
Is the only thing that's real
And I need you to be alright
I'm forever yours to hold
Oh, as long as I have a life
As long as I have life

[Verse 1]
Olivia, may I get to know ya?
Buy you a coffee or a drink sometime next week
Olivia, maybe I could call you
Olivia, what do ya think?
Yeah, what do ya think?

[Chorus]
'Cause Olivia Mae, I saw you standing there
Laughing, playing with your hair
Looking like you walked out of a dream
Olivia Mae, I hope it ain't just me
From where I'm standing I can see
Us finding our own kind of meant to be
Maybe I'm wrong, maybe I'm right
But I just had to try
Olivia, may I?
Olivia, may I?

[Verse 2]
Olivia Mae, I've fallen for you
The past year with you has been the best year of my life
And Olivia Mae, I think I love you
And I hope that that's alright
Tell me that's alright

[Chorus]
'Cause Olivia Mae, I saw you standing there
Laughing, playing with your hair
Looking like you walked out of a dream
Olivia Mae, I hope it ain't just me
From where I'm standing I can see
Us finding our own kind of meant to be
Maybe I'm wrong, maybe I'm right
But I just had to try
Olivia, may I?
Oh may I?

[Bridge]
Olivia, may I ask you a question?
What are you doing for the rest of your life?

[Chorus]
'Cause Olivia Mae, I see you standing there
The sunlight shining through your hair
No one ever looked so good in white
Olivia Mae, I'm glad it ain't just me
From where I'm standing I can see
The girl I'm meant to love for my whole life
And I know that I won't always get it right
But I promise I'll try
I promise I'll try
Olivia, may I?
Olivia, may I?
Olivia, may I?

[Intro]
Oh, babe

[Verse 1]
Never thought I would be like this
Wide awake waitin' on a goodnight kiss
Sippin' ninety proof, talkin' to the moon
Countin' down the hours till its two AM
Never thought I would be like this

[Chorus]
But as long as the night ends with you in a yellow cab Shootin' me a text sayin'
Comin' home soon
As long as I can bet on you crawlin' into bed after slippin' out ya high heel shoes
I ain't lyin' sayin' have a good time
Out with your girls, girl do what you do
No matter how late, baby I'll be stayin' up
I can't sleep without you

[Verse 2]
I'd be tossin' and turnin' all night babe
From the smell of your hair on the pillow case
Even if I tried without you by my side
I'd be dreamin with my eyes open
I'd be tossin' and turnin' all night babe

[Chorus]
But as long as the night ends with you in a yellow cab Shootin' me a text sayin'
Comin' home soon
As long as I can bet on you crawlin' into bed after slippin' out ya high heel shoes
I ain't lyin' sayin' have a good time
Out with your girls, girl do what you do
No matter how late, baby I'll be stayin' up
I can't sleep without you, no
I can't sleep without you, no, no

[Bridge]
I bet that DJ'S playin' your song
And your carryin' on
Baby I love the thought of that long as I know I'm the one you're comin home to

[Chorus]
But as long as the night ends with you in a yellow cab Shootin' me a text sayin'
Comin' home soon
As long as I can bet on you crawlin' into bed after slippin' out ya high heel shoes
I ain't lyin' sayin' have a good time
Out with your girls, girl do what you do
No matter how late, baby I'll be stayin' up
I can't sleep without you

[Outro]
Yeah no matter how late, baby I'll be stayin up
I can't sleep without you, no
Can't sleep without you
I can't sleep without you
Never thought I would be like this
Just wide awake waitin' on a goodnight kiss

[Verse 1]
In chapter one, I was raised on the Dodgers
Every boy wants to be like his father
In Little League, when he was coachin' me
I was hangin' on every word
Sundays, he was the one who would lead us
Taught me everything I know about Jesus
Front row, he's on a roll, and I'm hangin' on every word
It sounds nice, doesn't it?
I wish that I knew back then

[Chorus]
There's no perfect life, you can't hold back time
But you hold on tight, hopin' you might find
Every page you turn is a lesson learned
Ain't we all, ain't we all just tryna get it right?
These are the chapters of my life, mmm

[Verse 2]
Phase two, overwhelmed by attention
Everybody expectin' perfection
Throw a ball, then you'll have it all
Best thing I ever heard
Things change in the blink of an eyelid
Guess my body knew way more than I did
Doc said you'll never play again
Worst thing I ever heard
It's sounds rough, doesn't it?
I wish I knew back then

[Chorus]
There's no perfect life, you can't hold back time
But you hold on tight, hopin' you might find
Every page you turn is a lesson learned
Ain't we all, ain't we all just tryna get it right?
These are the chapters of my life
The chapters of my life

[Bridge]
Truth is that we all got stories
Gotta fail on your way to glory
Takes time tryna get it right
But every future has a past
And right now I can hear God laughin'
Guess he must have heard my plans
And my odes, thought it was a joke
Gave me more than I could ask
And I wish I knew back then, oh

[Chorus]
There's no perfect life, you can't hold back time
(Can't hold back time)
But you hold on tight (And you hold on tight)
Hopin' you might find
Every page you turn (Page you turn)
Is a lesson learned
Ain't we all, ain't we all just tryna get it right?
These are the chapters of my life

[Outro]
Chapters of my, chapters of my life
Chapters of my life
Chapters of my, yeah
The chapters of my life
Ooh, my life
The chapters of my life, oh
Mmm-mmm

Its crazy how you change the way I look at things
And its hard to believe I am the same man
When you first met me
I don't want to move I dont want to change a thing
I'm starting to think
I found the better part of me, yeah

Kiss by kiss I am getting to know you
And every time you look at me I just want to hold you
All my life I've been waiting for you
Little by little I'm falling for you
Kiss by kiss I'm falling for you
Kiss by kiss

I love the way you always find the good in things
When you make me believe
I could be the kind of man that you need
I want you to know I'm trying to show you
What this thing could be
It's easy to see that you bring out the best in me, yeah

Kiss by kiss and I'm getting to know you
And every time you look at me I just want to hold you
All my life I've been waiting for you
Little by little I'm falling for you
Kiss by kiss I'm falling for you
Kiss by kiss

The more I know the more this grows
The more I like what I see
And I get to know you just a little bit better
Every time you lean into me

Kiss by kiss
Kiss by kiss
Oh yeah

Kiss by kiss I'm getting to know you
And every time you look at me I just want to hold you
All my life I've been waiting for you
Little by little I'm falling for you
Kiss by kiss I'm falling for you
Kiss by kiss oh yeah
Kiss by kiss I'm falling for you
Kiss by kiss

[Verse 1]
There's a dress in the closet, that I just can’t throw away
I know it might sound crazy, but I haven't changed your pillowcase
A heart half full, or half empty
Is half gone either way, with you gone
What went wrong?

[Chorus]
Maybe the hardest part
Is we didn't break this heart
Nobody cheated or lied
I still have to live with goodbye
But how can I just move on?
I’ve loved you for way too long
I don't want to admit that you're gone
I don't wanna write this song
Don't wanna write this song

[Verse 2]
Another glass of whiskey, by your picture in a frame
I'm playin' all the black keys and cryin' out your name
I’m holdin’ on, or lettin' go
It’s gonna kill me either way
With you gone
Oh

[Chorus]
Maybe the hardest part
Is we didn't break this heart
Nobody cheated or lied
I still have to live with goodbye
But how can I just move on?
I've loved you for way too long
I don't want to admit that you’re gone
I don't wanna write this song
Don't wanna write this song

[Bridge]
Bobby pins on the dresser
Wilted flowers in a vase
I left a rose on your headstone
I never quite know what to say

[Chorus]
Maybe the hardest part
Is we didn't break this heart
Nobody cheated or lied
I still have to live with goodbye
But how can I just move on?
I've loved you for way too long
I don't want to admit that you're gone
I don't wanna write this song
No, don't wanna write this song
I don't wanna write this song
Mmm, don't wanna write this song, whoa

[Verse 1]
All my friends say that they're happy that I'm moving on
First time that they've seen me smile since you up and gone
But your memory won't let me go
Pretty as a picture that you'd hang up on a wall
But she just can't compare to you and it really ain't her fault
I know that I should fall for her
Believe me, girl, I've tried
But your memory won't let me

[Chorus]
She's all good, but you're the best I ever had
Tell me how could she ever compete with that
Ocean Boulevard still has my heart
Close my eyes and there we are
You're still the only place that feels like home
Cause your memory won't let me go
No, your memory won't let me

[Verse 2]
Sometimes when she's close to me I still smell your perfume
And every time I'm holding her, I'm really holding you
And any man in his right mind would be all hers by now
But your memory won't let me

[Chorus]
She's all good, but you're the best I ever had
Tell me how could she ever compete with that
Ocean Boulevard still has my heart
Close my eyes and there we are
You're still the only place that feels like home
Cause your memory won't let me go
Oh your memory won't let me

[Bridge]
I know that I should fall for her
Believe me, girl, I've tried
But your memory won't let me

[Chorus]
She's all good, but you're the best I ever had
Tell me how could she ever compete with that
Ocean Boulevard still has my heart
Close my eyes and there we are
You're still the only place that feels like home
Cause your memory won't let me go
Oh your memory won't let me go
No, your memory won't let me go
Won't let me
Oh your memory won't let me go

[Verse 1]
Home for seven days and I haven't even seen your face
I guess I've got a flight to change
There ain't nothin' left to say
If you really don't have it figured out by now
There's no need for me to hang around
I've gotta get out of town

[Chorus]
Five dollar drink and a lonely window seat
Half empty plane on New Years Eve
Love birds in the row in front of me are driving me crazy
The pilot comes on, says the year is almost gone
Five, four, three, two, one
Looks like it's just me and the whiskey
Cause you ain't here to kiss me
You ain't here to kiss me

[Verse 2]
Raise a toast to the thought of you and me
This was just the way it had to be
90 proof to give me clarity
The flight attendant must know that somethings going on
Can't hide the look of love gone wrong
So she's pouring them a little strong

[Chorus]
Five dollar drink and a lonely window seat
Half empty plane on New Years Eve
Love birds in the row in front of me are driving me crazy
The pilot comes on, says the year is almost gone
Five, four, three, two, one
Looks like it's just me and the whiskey
Cause you ain't here to kiss me
You ain't here to kiss me

[Bridge]
At least we had a chance to know how it feels to love
But it turns out love ain't always enough
So I'll start getting over you

[Chorus 2]
With another five dollar drink and a lonely window seat
Half empty plane on New Years Eve
Love birds in the row in front of me just like we used to be
The pilot comes on, says the year is almost gone
Five, four, three, two, one
Looks like it's just me and the whiskey
Cause you ain't here to kiss me yeah
You ain't here to kiss me
You ain't here to kiss me

I don't wanna ask too much or be to bold
And I don't want to weight you down with a heavy load
I've heard you say that you can handle anything
What I really need to know
Would you wait for me
When I got to leave
Could I ever be Everything you need
If I promise you my love
Could that promise be  enough
Would you wait for me
Would you wait for me
I don't need a magic knight to make me feel
Like living in a fairy tale
I know this love is real
Hear me when I sing whenever I'm away
My heart is with you all the same
Would you wait for me
When I got to leave
Could I ever be
Everything you need
If I promise you my love
Could that promise be in love
Would you wait for me
Would you wait for me
Looking back at where we've been
Being scared to let you in
You becoming my best friend
No matter where I travel to
I'm coming right back home to you
If you just wait for me
Would you wait for me
When I got to leave
Could I ever be
Everything you need
If I promise you my love
Could that promise be in love
Would you wait for me
Would you wait for me
Would you wait for me
When I got to leave
Could I ever be
Everything you need
If I promise you my love
Could that promise be in love
Would you wait for me
Would you wait for me

[Verse 1]
When you see somebody
Who erases everybody in the room
I don't know what to say, I don't know what to do
That's what you did to me when I saw you
Under strung-up white lights, dancin' all alone
I wanna know you like I know every road back home
From that first tell-all, I knew that I'd never, I'd never let you go

[Chorus]
Oh, I
I don't wanna change who you are
I don't wanna mess with your dreams
Or get in the way of who you wanna be
No, I
I won't stop your runaway heart
I just wanna be why you stay
Only thing about you that I'd change is
I'd change your name

[Verse 2]
I can't see 20 years from now
Hell, I can barely see today
Can't promise you your sky won't drop a little rain
When that smile in the mirror disappears
I promise you I'll be right here

[Chorus]
Oh, I
I don't wanna change who you are
I don't wanna mess with your dreams
Or get in the way of who you wanna be
No, I
I won't stop your runaway heart
I just wanna be why you stay
Only thing about you that I'd change is
I'd change your name

[Bridge]
I'd change the face you see
When you open up your eyes
I'd change the lips you kiss
When you say goodnight
For the rest of your life

[Chorus]
Oh, I
I don't wanna change who you are
I don't wanna mess with your dreams
Or get in the way of who you wanna be
No, I
I won't stop your runaway heart
I just wanna be why you stay
Only thing about you that I'd change is
I'd change your name

[Outro]
Change your name
Mmm

[Verse 1]
Gate 22, two hour delay
She was waiting on a plane to L.A.
I didn't see the harm in sittin' down
At the wrong gate
She said "Hello, where you headed to?"
I didn't lie, but I bent the truth
Said "I'd go anywhere with you"
And before long

[Chorus]
It was midnight in the middle of JFK
Tryna take her mind off the fallin' rain
I was saying anythin' to make her laugh
Never wanted anything so bad
She got me wishing that she could stay
Doesn't even know that I missed my plane
Now there ain't a single thing I wouldn't trade
For a ticket to L.A., yeah, yeah
A ticket to L.A., yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse 2]
She opened up after a drink
Said she's starting law school in the spring
And by the time that she had three
I knew almost everything
Lightnin' flashed across the sky
I said it probably wasn't safe to fly
Secretly, I hoped that she'd be stuck with me all night

[Chorus]
It was midnight in the middle of JFK
Tryna take her mind off the fallin' rain
I was sayin' anything to make her laugh
Never wanted anything so bad
She got me wishin' that she could stay
Doesn't even know that I missed my plane
Now there ain't a single thing I wouldn't trade
For a ticket to L.A.

[Bridge]
Now gate 22 is calling out her name
She wrote her number on my hand and walked away

[Chorus]
Alone here in the middle of JFK
Sitting at a bar at an empty gate
I'd do anythin' to bring her back
Never wanted anything so bad
She got me wishin' that she could stay
Doesn't even know that I missed my plane
Now there ain't a single thing I wouldn't trade
For a ticket to L.A., yeah, yeah
A ticket to L.A., yeah, yeah
A ticket to L.A.
A ticket to L.A.
A ticket to L.A.
Woo-hoo-hoo, woo-hoo-hoo
Woo-hoo-hoo
A ticket to L.A., yeah, yeah

[Verse One]
I wish you'd pack your things
And cursed my name
And slammed the door behind you
Instead you took my hand
And tried to help me understand
How dare you?
There's really nothing left to say so

[Chorus]
I'm gonna smoke anything that burns
Drink everything they serve
Set'em up and knock'em down
And just forget you
I'll go numb to all this hurt
Drown the memory of what we were
At the bottom of this bottle if I have to
I'll pretend I never loved you

[Verse Two]
Sitting in this corner booth
Where I met you
Just acting like I don't miss it
I never wanted this
But now I wish our first kiss never happened
Lord, I just need to put the past away so

[Repeat Chorus]

[Bridge]
I'll pretend I never loved you
Woah, I'll pretend I never loved you
You make it look so easy
Getting by without me
It's like you never skipped a beat so

[Repeat Chorus]

I'll pretend I never loved you
Woah, I'll pretend I never loved you
Oh baby, I'll pretend I never loved you
I'll pretend I never loved you

[Intro]
Yeah

[Verse 1]
The sunlight sneakin' through the window
Slidin' down your pillow, shinin' like a halo, baby
I like wakin' up before you
Just so I can watch you sleepin' like an angel, baby
Five minute sweet spot
Before the alarm clock goes off and ruins everything

[Chorus]
I got two hands and all they wanna do is hold ya
I got two eyes that are dyin' to watch you wakin' up
I got a kiss that'll get you thinkin' it's Saturday
I'll give you a reason, I'll give you a reason to stay

[Verse 2]
Coffee, you ain't gonna need it
It only gets you leavin' sooner than I want you to
Let's just stay under the covers, tangled in each other
Straight on through the afternoon

[Bridge]
You always say that I can't make you late
But I bet I can make that a lie, huh

[Chorus]
I got two hands and all they wanna do is hold ya
I got two eyes that are dyin' to watch you wakin' up
I got a kiss that'll get you thinkin' it's Saturday
I'll give you a reason, I'll give you a reason to stay
I really like the way your head fits on my shoulder
I hate the way the morning's always tryna mess this up
I know you've got a thousand things to do today
But I'll give you a reason, I'll give you a reason to stay
A reason to stay

[Bridge]
Whoa, you always say that I can't make you late
But I bet I can make that a lie

[Chorus]
I got two hands and all they wanna do is hold ya
I got two eyes that are dyin' to watch you wakin' up
I got a kiss that'll get you thinkin' it's Saturday
I'll give you a reason, I'll give you a reason to stay
I really like the way your head fits on my shoulder
I hate the way the morning's always trying to mess this up
I know you've got a thousand things to do today
But I'll give you a reason, I'll give you a reason to stay

[Outro]
Oh, a reason to stay
Oh, oh, to stay
A reason to stay

[Verse 1]
The look that haunts you, the eyes that caught you
The voice that stops you on a dime, let it be mine
The hands that fit you, the song that gets you
The drink that makes you spill your mind, let it be mine

[Chorus]
If you need someone to call tonight
A place to crash and let your body fall tonight
If you're lookin' for a kiss to make it all alright
If you're gonna to cross the line
If you're gonna take somebody's time
Let it be mine, let it be mine

[Verse 2]
The dream that steals you, the touch that heals you
The kind of wild that drives you wild, even if it's just a little while
(Just a little while)
A home that needs you, secret that keeps you
A book that reads between your lines, let it be mine

[Chorus]
If you need someone to call tonight
A place to crash and let your body fall tonight
If you're lookin' for a kiss to make it all alright
If you're gonna to cross the line
If you're gonna take somebody's time
Let it be mine, girl, let it be mine
Ooh, let it be mine

[Bridge]
I don't know what tomorrow you had in mind
But let it be mine, let it be mine
And I don't know what road you're gonna take this time
But let it be mine, ooh let it be mine

[Chorus]
If you need someone to call tonight
A place to crash and let your body fall tonight
If you're lookin' for a kiss to make it all alright
If you're gonna to cross the line
If you're gonna take somebody's time
Ooh, let it be mine
Oh, let it be mine
Girl, let it be mine, let it be mine
Oh

[Verse 1]
The thing about a break up
Sometimes you just gotta break down
Coming off a great love
There's plenty of pain to pass around
Like a tip jar in a dive bar
Full of broken hearts
It's a lonely crowd
The thing about a breakup
Sometimes you just gotta break down

[Chorus]
When the only thing you want is
The only thing that you can't have
When the part that you can't take is
Knowing you can't take it back
She's on the good side, goodbye
On the right sight of free
And you're on the wrong end of a long night
On the left side of leavin'
Yeah
On the left side of leavin'

[Verse 2]
The thing about a last kiss
You never know that it's the last
Till they call the last call
And you're just drinking about the past
Like the bottom of the bottle
Knows how to get her back
The thing about a last kiss
You never know that it's the last

[Chorus]
When the only thing you want is
The only thing that you can't have
When the part that you can't take is
Knowing you can't take it back
She's on the good side, goodbye
On the right sight of free
And you're on the wrong end of a long night
On the left side of leavin'
Yeah
On the left side of leavin'
Stuck on the left side

[Bridge]
You're on the drunk part of drinking
The can't stop part of thinking
The wide awake part of sleeping, woah
You're on the broke part of breaking
The mistake part of making
You're on the cane part of shaking, woah

[Chorus]
When the only thing you want is
The only thing that you can't have
When the part that you can't take is
Knowing you can't take it back
She's on the good side, goodbye
On the right sight of free
And you're on the wrong end of a long night
On the left side of leavin'
Yeah
On the left side of leavin'

[Intro]
I can't get you close enough
I can't get you close enough
I can't get you close enough
I can't get you close enough
Mmmh

[Verse 1]
It ain't like this 15 hundred miles between us
And it ain't been but 15 minutes since I've seen ya
Your side of the love seat might as well be California
And my side feels like Carolina girl the way I want ya

[Chorus]
Cause I can't get you close enough, I can't get you close enough
It's touching, going might go crazy everytime we touch
If there's an inch of air between our two hearts beating that's too much
Cause I can't get you close enough, I can't get you close enough
Oooh
Oh oh
Oooh
Oh oh

[Verse 2]
I don't just know you, I know everything about you
So I just can't begin to wrap my mind around you
You're sun and rain, fire and ice, a whole new world behind your eyes
I want to kiss you when you close 'em and hold you till they open

[Chorus]
Cause I can't get you close enough, I can't get you close enough
It's touching, going might go crazy everytime we touch
If there's an inch of air between our two hearts beating that's too much
Cause I can't get you close enough, I can't get you close enough
Oooh
Oh oh
Come over here and kiss me babe
Oooh
Oh oh
Come over here

[Bridge]
Lean on in
I need more than skin on skin

[Chorus]
I can't get you close enough, I can't get you close enough
It's touching, going might go crazy everytime we touch
If there's an inch of air between our two hearts beating that's too much
Cause I can't get you close enough, I can't get you close enough
Oooh
Oh oh
Ooooh
Oh oh
I can't get you close enough

[Verse 1]
Mmmh
Baby when you pull your hair back
Kinda like red lipstick slow rollin' on your lips
The mirror on a Saturday night
Oh you got that look in your eye
I see you slippin' on your high heels
Worn out of town, edge of the bed, showin' some leg
When you doin' that hallway walk
Oh, baby, I can barely talk

[Chorus]
Makin' me say mmm
I can't fight it
I'll do anything you want to do tonight
So oh hell
Little black dress got me in a mess can't even say yes
Got me tongue tied, and wide-eyed
And can't lie, I like it when you make me say mmm ooooh
I like it when you make me say mmm

[Verse 2]
When you get a little ticked off
And a four letter word slips out of your mouth
I can't help but laugh
You're so sexy when you're mad
The way that you can get your buzz on one or two drinks
Cute little dimple on your cheeks
Start throwing flirty lines at me
Saying baby come and dance with me
Dance with me

[Chorus]
Makin' me say mmm
I can't fight it
I'll do anything you want to do tonight
So oh hell
Little black dress got me in a mess can't even say yes
Got me tongue tied, and wide-eyed
And can't lie, I like it when you make me say mmm ooooh
I like it when you make me say
Mmmh
I like it when you make me say

[Bridge]
Girl you got me sayin' good lord, God bless, amen
Again and again
Sayin' good lord, God bless, amen

[Chorus]
Makin' me say mmm
I can't fight it
I'll do anything you want to do tonight
So oh hell
Little black dress got me in a mess can't even say yes
Got me tongue tied, and wide-eyed
And can't lie, I like it when you make me say mmm ooooh
I like it when you make me say mmm
I like it when you make me say mmm
I like it when you make me say
Oooh
I like it when you make me say mmm

[Verse 1]
I feel like 16, sneakin' out in Daddy's car tonight
Index finger tracin' all the stars in your eyes
It was music playin' in the background
But I don't even care what they're singin' about
I'm just 16, sneakin' out in Daddy's car tonight

[Chorus]
I'ma need a 1-2-3, Mississippi
Timeout right now 'cause I'm fallin' too fast for you
Listenin' to your life story on the hood of a '64 Cadillac
One, I'ma lean in to kiss you
Two, say a little too much too soon
Three, try not to forget to breathe
I need a 1-2-3, Mississippi
1-2-3, Mississippi

[Verse 2]
Like a roller coaster car comin' off the tracks
Watchin' all my self control fall through your hands
I know I could try to fight this
But right now it looks like this
Rollercoaster car is comin' off the tracks, yeah

[Chorus]
I'ma need a 1-2-3, Mississippi
Timeout right now 'cause I'm fallin' too fast for you
Listenin' to your life story on the hood of a '64 Cadillac
One, I'ma lean in to kiss you
Two, say a little too much too soon
Three, try not to forget to breathe
I need a 1-2-3, Mississippi
1-2-3, Mississippi, yeah

[Bridge]
Count down to the point of no return
But count fast, baby I'm already yours

[Chorus]
I'ma need a 1-2-3, Mississippi
Timeout right now 'cause I'm fallin' too fast for you
Listenin' to your life story on the hood of a '64 Cadillac
One, I'ma lean in to kiss you
Two, say a little too much too soon
Three, try not to forget to breathe
I need a 1-2-3, Mississippi
1-2-3, Mississippi, mmm
Oh, Mississippi
1-2, 1-2-3, Mississippi
Whoa, whoa, Mississippi

[Verse 1]
What was I thinkin'?
Flyin' away that night
What was I drinkin'?
Damn near made me lose my mind
Where was I going, what was I doing?
What was I hoping that I'd find?
What was I thinkin'?
Flyin' away that night

[Chorus]
From those bright brown eyes shinin' like the storm settin' fire to the water
That sunrise smile lightin' up that Northwest coastline
That safe place kiss girl, how the hell did I not know?
Walkin' away from you was like runnin', runnin', runnin'
Runnin' away from home
Runnin', runnin'

[Verse 2]
I must've been crazy, trying to let you go
When you were the only one thing my heart has ever known
You were the place I wanna lay my head
Instead I'm layin' down alone
I must've been crazy, tryin' to let go

[Chorus]
Of those bright brown eyes shinin' like the storm settin' fire to the water
That sunrise smile lightin' up that Northwest coastline
That safe place kiss girl, how the hell did I not know?
Walkin' away from you was like runnin', runnin', runnin'
Runnin' away from home
Runnin', runnin'
Runnin' away from home

[Bridge]
I must've been crazy (Runnin', runnin')
What was I thinkin'? (Runnin')
Yeah

[Chorus]
From those bright brown eyes shinin' like the storm settin' fire to the water
That sunrise smile lightin' up that Northwest coastline
That safe place kiss girl, how the hell did I not know?
Walkin' away from you was like runnin', runnin', runnin'
Runnin' away from home

[Outro]
Runnin', runnin', runnin'
Runnin' away from home
Runnin', runnin'
Runnin' away from home
Runnin', runnin'

[Verse 1]
Rode into town and only eighteen
My girl beside me and a baby in a car seat
Everybody called me crazy
That was fine as long as I knew
She believed
Not a nickel to our name
Cheap motel east side of town just south of Main
Songs I wrote for change
And one day I'd be headlining the stage

[Chorus]
She gives me strength
When mine's all gone
She always keeps me hanging on
When I feel I've lost my way
She leads me home
She don't know how much I need her
A beautiful believer

[Verse 2]
I just got the news today
You know that song I wrote for you has made its way
Then oh so much has changed
You know the one thing that has always stayed the same

[Chorus]
She gives me strength
When mine's all gone
She always keeps me hanging on
When I feel I've lost my way
She leads me home
She don't know how much I need her
A beautiful believer

[Bridge]
Beautiful believer
Every time I doubt myself
Before I even ask for help
She's right there next to me
A beautiful believer
Every night I close my eyes
Just knowing that she's by my side
That's all I really need

[Chorus]
She gives me strength
When mine's all gone
She always keeps me hanging on
When I feel I've lost my way
She leads me home
She don't know how much I need her
A beautiful believer
She don't know how much I need her
A beautiful believer

[Verse 1]
I was made for a dive bar
Usually good for the night
I can sure hold my whiskey
I can hold my wine
You were made for the ocean
The silver water and wind
You're the ship, I’m the bottle
And I don't wanna hold you in

[Chorus]
I don't know how you got here
I know they all wonder too
’Cause when they're lookin' at me, girl
They're really lookin' at you
You just might have to break me
To do what you're meant to do
You're the ship, I'm the bottle
And I can’t do that to you

[Verse 2]
I want to stay wrapped around you
But we both know that I can’t
So put the breeze in your sails, girl
And sink your toes in the sand
Maybe I'll write you a letter
Maybe I’ll keep it inside
Maybe one day you'll get it
While you're out chasin' the tide

[Chorus]
I don’t know how you got here
I know they all wonder too
'Cause when they're lookin' at me, girl
They're really lookin' at you
You just might have to break me
To do what you're meant to do
You're the ship, I'm the bottle
And I can't do that to you

[Chorus]
Ooh, you might just have to break me
And I know you don't want to
You're the ship, I'm the bottle
And I wanna keep you, I do
But you're the ship, I'm the bottle
And I can't do that to you

[Outro]
Mmm (Ooh, ooh, ooh)
Sendin' an S.O.S. to the world
(Ooh, ooh, ooh) Mmm
(Ooh, ooh, ooh) Mmm, mmm, mmm
(Ooh, ooh, ooh)

[Verse 1]
Yeah
I put you out like a cigarette
Poured you down the drain with no regrets
Went through 11 of those 12 steps
But 11 ain't enough I guess
One phone call on a lonely night
And we're both back at the startin' line
Now there's ashes in the ashtray
Lipstick on the bottle
Back on the same road, goin' full throttle
And just like that

[Chorus]
We go fallin' off the wagon
Got ourselves a real bad habit
Girl, you got me actin' like an addict
All messed up, no matter what
You know I just gotta have it
Even though it winds up tragic
Tonight, whatever happens, happens
And tomorrow, we'll get back on the wagon
Yeah
We'll get back on the wagon, whoa

[Verse 2]
So let's let both ends of the candle burn
Love like the mornin' light won't hurt
Wake up lyin' 'bout lessons learned
'Cause that's just what we do
Again and again

[Chorus]
We go fallin' off the wagon
Got ourselves a real bad habit
Girl, you got me actin' like an addict
All messed up, no matter what
You know I just gotta have it
Even though it winds up tragic
Tonight, whatever happens, happens
And tomorrow, we'll get back on the wagon
Whoa

[Bridge]
Tomorrow we'll do what we should
But tonight is gonna hurt so good
Fallin' off the wagon, yeah
We've got ourselves a real bad habit
And we just gotta have it, so

[Chorus]
We go fallin' off the wagon
Got ourselves a real bad habit
Girl, you got me actin' like an addict
All messed up, no matter what
You know I just gotta have it
Even though it winds up tragic
Tonight, whatever happens, happens
And tomorrow, we'll get back on the wagon
Whoa, whoa
Yeah tomorrow, we'll get back on the wagon

Now I've heard there was a secret chord
That David played, and it pleased the Lord
But you don't really care for music, do you?
It goes like this the fourth, the fifth
The minor fall and the major lift
The baffled king composing "Hallelujah"

Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah

You say I took the name in vain
I don't even know the name
But if I did, well really, what's it to you?
There's a blaze of light in every word
It doesn't matter what you heard
The holy or the broken Hallelujah

Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah

I did my best, it wasn't much
I couldn't feel, so I tried to touch
I've told the truth, I didn't come to fool you
And even though it all went wrong
I'll stand before the Lord of Song
With nothing on my tongue but Hallelujah

Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelu-
Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelu-
Hallelujah

[Intro]
Mmm

[Verse 1]
I was born to run
Always out there chasin' the sun
Never really needed no one
'Til you came around
And made me wanna put my roots down

[Chorus]
Now you got me where you want me
Girl, you got me good
Sayin' things I never thought I would, even could
Talkin' 'bout forever like I never have before
Pourin' out my heart at your door
Yeah, you got me where you want me
But baby, you don't want me no more
Mmm, mmm

[Verse 2]
You live and die by the chase
And I can tell by that look there on your face
You look at love like a race
And once you've won, you're done

[Chorus]
Now you got me where you want me
Girl, you got me good
Sayin' things I never thought I would, even could
Talkin' 'bout forever like I never have before
Pourin' out my heart at your door
Yeah, you got me where you want me
But baby, you don't want me no more

[Bridge]
Will you ever find what you're lookin' for?
Girl, what are you lookin' for?

[Chorus]
'Cause you got me where you want me
Girl, you got me good
Sayin' things I never thought I would, even could
Talkin' 'bout forever like I never have before
Just pourin' out my heart at your door
Yeah, you got me where you want me
But baby, you don't want me no more

[Outro]
Ooh, yeah, you got me where you want me
But baby, you don't want me no more
Ooh, you just don't want me no more
You don't want me no more
No more, no more
Girl, no, no
No, no, ooh

[Intro]
Woo
Hey, girl
Yeah

[Verse 1]
The picture ain't in the picture frame where it used to hang
I had to take that down, hm
And the funny thing is the phone will ring and I'll think it's you
But it ain't you now, no
I don't always think about you, girl, but when I do
I can't keep myself from crazy missin' you

[Chorus]
We used to stay up all night kissin'
Dancin' barefoot in the kitchen
Tippin' glasses of red wine, splashin'
We used to hold each other 'til the mornin'
Before you know it, then you're in over your head
Then it's over too soon
No matter what I do, it just ain't no use
I just can't get used to missin' you, no
Oh, no, no

[Verse 2]
In the bottom drawer is the old t-shirt that you always wore
I couldn't throw that out, oh no
'Cause a broken heart's still a broken heart
Even when you start breakin' memories down, whoa
I'm gettin' pretty good at actin' like I'm movin' on
Then a song you used to sing comes on
And I start wishin' you weren't gone

[Chorus]
We used to stay up all night kissin'
Dancin' barefoot in the kitchen
Tippin' glasses of red wine, splashin'
We used to hold each other 'til the mornin'
Before you know it, then you're in over your head
Then it's over too soon
No matter what I do, it just ain't no use
I just can't get used to missin' you, no
Woo, oh, whoa

[Bridge]
Well, I don't always think about you, girl, but when I do
I can't keep myself from crazy missin' you
And I'm gettin' pretty good at actin' like I'm movin' on
Then a song you used to sing comes on
And I start to wishin' you weren't gone

[Chorus]
We used to stay up all night kissin'
Dancin' barefoot in the kitchen
Tippin' glasses of red wine, splashin'
We used to hold each other 'til the mornin'
Before you know it, then you're in over your head
Then it's over too soon
No matter what I do (What I do)
It just ain't no use (Ain't no use)
I just can't get used to missin' you (Whoa)
No matter what I do (What I do)
It just ain't no use (Ain't no use)
I just can't get used to missin' you, no (Whoa)
I just can't get used to missin' you, no girl
No matter what I do, it just ain't no use
I just can't get used to missin' you, no

Suffocating
And what was on my chest
Out of love, out of line
Nearly out of my mind

I'm tired of waiting
Giving all my best
In a maze, in a haze
I was wasting my time

I was broken, I was scared
But now I'm coming up for air

You came around
Turn me inside out and upside down
I had no plans to try again
Or let somebody in
Without a sound
You stole my heart and knocked me to the ground
Gave freedom to the wind
And teaching me to breathe again

Lungs are burning
My walls were closing in
On the floor needing more
Than a door or window

All the hurting wars
I couldn't win
You were there in a prayer
With a glimmer of hope

I was shaken, I was sure
That I would never find the cure

You came around
Turn me inside out and upside down
I had no plans to try again
Or let somebody in
Without a sound
You stole my heart and knocked me to the ground
Gave freedom to the wind
Teaching me to breathe again

Teaching me to open up
Teaching me to care
Teaching me to take a chance
Feels like I'm almost there

You came around
Turn me inside out and upside down
I had no plans to try again
Or let somebody in
Without a sound
You stole my heart and knocked me to the ground
Gave freedom to the wind

You came around
Turn me inside out and upside down
I had no plans to try again
Or let somebody in
Without a sound
You stole my heart and knocked me to the ground
Gave freedom to the wind
Teaching me to breathe again
Mmm breathe again

She seemed like everything I needed
Heaven sent in the nick of time
One day we kissed, the next we kneel

Just hiding from the fire

When you're young, you’re innocent and hopeful
You think your heart can't make mistakes
One day your life seems like a movie
The next its up in flames

Cause you're on fire
Nothings like it used to be so you try
To shake yourself and make believe that this life
Is something more than what sets us on fire

As we come along we grow to wonder
Will I ever find someone?
It’s only natural to fear it
When the past caused you to run

When the scars feel like they'll never leave
So you find comfort in the game
And now the day to day might please you
But then it's up in flames

Cause you're on fire
Nothings like it used to be so you try
To shake yourself and make believe that this life
Is something more than what sets us on fire
On fire

Then someone new comes crashing in
And your jaded heart feels young again
Suddenly it's setting you on fire
On fire

You're on fire
Nothings like it used to be so you try
To shake yourself and make believe that this life
Is something more than what sets us on fire
On fire
On fire
On fire
On fire
Yeah On fire

[Verse 1: Brett Young]
If ever I get lost in your eyes tonight
Please just let me stay right there a little bit longer
Underneath the stars, we are on fire
And I don't wanna go if you don't wanna go

[Chorus: Brett Young]
We can just stay here in this minute
Lose all track of time
Let the world spin on without us for a while
I'm tellin' you, we're just one kiss away from heaven
So baby, hold on tight
'Cause I want to get wrapped up in your love
So baby, let's just stay here tonight, tonight

[Verse 2: Charles Kelley]
GirI, I just wanna linger like this on your lips
And taste the salt air on your skin
Hold you in my hands
Anything and everything, you know that I'm all in

[Chorus: Brett Young & Charles Kelley]
We can just stay here in this minute
Lose all track of time
Let the world spin on without us for a while
I'm tellin' you, we're just one kiss away from heaven
So baby, hold on tight
'Cause I want to get wrapped up in your love
So baby, let's just stay here tonight, tonight
Baby, let's just stay here tonight, tonight, tonight

[Bridge: Brett Young]
'Cause I don't wanna go if you don't wanna go
We can just stay here in this minute
Lose all track of time
Let the world spin on without us for a while

[Chorus: Brett Young & Charles Kelley]
Oh, I'm tellin' you, we're just one kiss away from heaven
So baby, hold on tight
'Cause I want to get wrapped up in your love
So baby, let's just stay here tonight, tonight, tonight
Baby, let's just stay here tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight, whoa

I know you wanna leave me
But I refuse to let you go
If I have to beg, plead for your sympathy
I don't mind 'cause you mean that much to me

Ain't too proud to beg and you know it
Please don't leave me girl
Don't you go
Ain't too proud to plead, baby, baby
Please don't leave me, girl
Don't you go

Now I've heard a cryin' man
Is half a man with no sense of pride
But if I have to cry to keep you
I don't mind weepin' if it'll keep you by my side

Ain't too proud to beg and you know it
Please don't leave me girl
Don't you go
Ain't too proud to plead, baby, baby
Please don't leave me, girl
Don't you go

If I have to sleep on your doorstep all night and day
Just to keep you from walking away
Let your friends laugh, even this I can stand
'cause I wanna keep you any way I can

Ain't too proud to beg and you know it
Please don't leave me girl
Don't you go
Ain't too proud to plead, baby, baby
Please don't leave me, girl
Don't you go

Now I've got a love so deep in the pit of my heart
And each day it grows more and more
I'm not ashamed to call and plead to you, baby
If pleading keeps you from walking out that door

Ain't too proud to beg and you know it
Please don't leave me girl
Don't you go
Ain't too proud to plead, baby, baby
Please don't leave me, girl
Don't you go

[Verse 1]
Dreams, that's where I have to go
To see your beautiful face anymore
I stare at a picture of you and listen to the radio
Hope, hope there's a conversation
We both admit, we had it good
But until then it's alienation, I know
That much is understood
And I realise

[Chorus]
If you asked me how I'm doing
I would say I'm doing just fine
I would lie and say that you're not on my mind
But I go out and I sit down at a table set for two
And finally, I'm forced to face the truth
No matter what I say, I'm not over you
(Not over you)

[Verse 2]
Damn, damn girl, you do it well
And I thought you were innocent
You took this heart and put it through hell
But still you're magnificent
And I, I'm a boomerang, doesn't matter how you throw me
I turn around and I'm back in the game
Even better than the old me
But I'm not even close without you

[Chorus]
If you ask me how I'm doing
I would say I'm doing just fine
I would lie and say that you're not on my mind
But I go out and I sit down at a table set for two
And finally, I'm forced to face the truth
No matter what I say, I'm not over you

[Bridge]
And if I had the chance to renew
You know there isn't a thing I wouldn't do
I could get back on the right track
But only if you'd be convinced
So until then

[Chorus]
If you ask me how I'm doing
I would say I'm doing just fine
I would lie and say that you're not on my mind
But I go out and I sit down at a table set for two
And finally, I'm forced to face the truth
No matter what I say, I'm not over you
Not over you, not over you, not over you

The smallest thing can make you wanna change
Somebody new comes in
And chases all the pain away

Who are you now
Let your Heart cry out
Where did your wounds go
And how can these scars be the only thing left

Or the only thing you've known for so long
Could you be that strong
The heart was meant to love and let love go

Theres nothing quite like dancing in the rain
Or the song that comes on just in time to save an awful day
And you can't complain
We can all relate

Its like a smile from a stranger
When you just got to feeling like nobody cared

And you let go of anger
And you find prayer
There's healing there
The heart was given power to forgive

I am not the type to fantasize about what i can't see
But That doesn't mean that I
Have to close my eyes to that which I believe

And I've been here long enough
To know who put the stars up in my sky
And I
I wanna share them with you now

Cause I don't see any reason in living alone
I love all that you do
How could I go
I promise I won't

My heart was made to give you openly
My heart is yours
My heart is yours
Smallest thing can make you wanna change
Somebody new comes
And chases all the pain away
Who are you now

[Verse 1]
Mercy
Why you gotta show up lookin' so good just to hurt me?
Why you wanna stop this whole damn world from turning?
Mercy
Why you hanging on so tight if this ain't working?
Why you wanna stop this flame if it's still burning?
Cause it's still burning

[Chorus]
So if you're gonna break my heart, just break it
And if you're gonna take your shot, then take it
Take it
If you made up your mind, then make it
But make this fast
If you ever loved me
Have mercy

[Verse 2]
If you go out tonight and get drunk and lonely
Wind up home alone please don't call me
And say you miss me, no

[Chorus]
So if you're gonna break my heart, just break it
And if you're gonna take your shot, then take it
Take it
If you made up your mind, then make it
But make this fast
If you ever loved me
Have mercy

[Bridge]
Woah
Oh have mercy

[Chorus]
If you're gonna break my heart, just break it
If you're gonna take your shot, take it
Take it
Oh if you're gonna break my heart, just break it
And if you're gonna take your shot, then take it
Take it
If you made up your mind, then make it
But make this fast
If you ever loved me
Mmmh if you ever loved me
Have mercy
Oh have mercy
Oh have mercy

So baby, what's it been eight years
Maybe ten we been friends
Here we are again
Moonlight until the sunrise sipping wine

I see your mouth moving about some other guy
But lately all I hear in the back of my mind is
No more, what if it's about time?
To lay it on the line

Don't panic if I say I can't take it if it ain't forever
Don't panic if one day you see me on one knee
Please don't think I don't know what we stand to lose
And down the road you see me sayin' I love you
Baby, don't panic

Remember that night in the Tennessee air?
We had a little too much
And we kissed on a dare
You can't tell you didn't feel it too

Just last week when we were dancing slow
At your big brother wedding's
We got a little too close
That's more than just friends do

Lord, don't panic if I say I can't take it if it ain't forever
Don't panic if one day you see me on one knee
Please don't think I don't know what we stand to lose
And down the road you see me sayin' I love you
Baby, don't panic

You probably think you don't roll with the good
But whose to say you can't make a good thing better?
Oh

Don't panic if I say I can't take it if it ain't forever
Don't panic if one day you see me on one knee
Please don't think I don't know what we stand to lose
And down the road you see me sayin' I love you

Baby, don't panic if I say I can't take it if ain't forever
Don't panic if one day you see me on one knee
Please don't think I don't know what we stand to lose
And down the road you see me sayin' I love you
Baby, don't panic

So baby, what's it been eight years
Maybe ten we been friends
Here we are again
Moonlight until the sunrise sipping wine

[Verse 1]
Right now, he's probably slow dancing
With a bleached-blond tramp
And she's probably getting frisky
Right now, he's probably buying her some fruity little drink
'Cause she can't shoot whiskey
Right now, he's probably up behind her with a pool-stick
Showing her how to shoot a combo
And he don't know

[Chorus]
I dug my key into the side
Of his pretty little souped up four-wheel drive
Carved my name into his leather seats
I took a Louisville slugger to both headlights
Slashed a hole in all four tires
Maybe next time, he'll think before he cheats

[Verse 2]
Right now, she's probably up singing some
White-trash version of Shania karaoke
Right now, she's probably saying, "I'm drunk"
And he's a thinking that he's gonna get lucky
Right now, he's probably dabbing on
Three dollars worth of that bathroom polo
Oh, and he don't know

[Chorus]
Oh, that I dug my key into the side
Of his pretty little souped up four-wheel drive
Carved my name into his leather seats
I took a Louisville slugger to both headlights
Slashed a hole in all four tires
Maybe next time, he'll think before he cheats

[Bridge]
I might've saved a little trouble for the next girl
'Cause the next time that he cheats
Oh, you know it won't be on me
No, not on me

[Chorus]
'Cause I dug my key into the side
Of his pretty little souped up four-wheel drive
Carved my name into his leather seats
I took a Louisville slugger to both headlights
Slashed a hole in all four tires
Maybe next time, he'll think before he cheats

[Outro]
Oh, maybe next time, he'll think before he cheats
Oh, before he cheats
Oh

[Verse 1]
I'm sorry, but I'm just a girl
Not usually the kind to show my heart to the world
I'm pretty good at keepin' it together
I hold my composure, for worse or for better
So I apologize if you don't like what you see
But sometimes my emotions get the best of me
And falling apart is as human as it gets
You can't hide it, you can't fight what the truth is

[Chorus 1]
You can pretty lie and say it's okay
You can pretty smile and just walk away
Pretty much fake your way through anything
But you can't cry pretty

[Verse 2]
Oh no, you can’t dress it up in lace or rhinestones
It don't matter if you're in a crowd or home all alone
Yeah, it's all the same when you're looking in the mirror
A picture of pain, so let it flow like a river

[Chorus 1]
You can pretty lie and say it's okay
You can pretty smile and just walk away
Pretty much fake your way through anything
But you can't cry pretty

[Chorus 2]
You can't turn off the flood when the dam breaks
When all your mascara is going to waste
When things get ugly, you just gotta face
That you can't cry pretty

[Bridge]
Oh no, you can't
Ooh, yeah

[Chorus 2]
You can't turn off the flood when the dam breaks
When all your mascara is going to waste
When things get ugly, you just gotta face
That you can't cry pretty

[Outro]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
No, you can't cry
No, you can't cry
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, woo
You can't cry
You can't cry pretty, baby
Oh yeah, woo, woo
No, you can't cry pretty, yeah

[Verse 1: Carrie Underwood]
I’ll be the last one standing
Two hands in the air, I’m a champion
You’ll be looking up at me when it’s over
I live for the battle, I’m a soldier, yeah
I’m a fighter like Rocky
Put you flat on your back like Ali
Yeah, I’m the greatest, I’m stronger
Paid my dues, can’t lose, I'ma own ya, ay

[Pre-Chorus 1: Carrie Underwood]
I’ve been working my whole life
And now, it’s do or die

[Chorus: Carrie Underwood]
I am invincible, unbreakable
Unstoppable, unshakeable
They knock me down, I get up again
I am the champion, you’re gon’ know my name
You can’t hurt me now, I can’t feel the pain
I was made for this, yeah, I was born to win
I am the champion

[Verse 2: Carrie Underwood]
When they write my story
They're gonna say that I did it for the glory
But don’t think that I did it for the fame, yeah
I did it for the love of the game, yeah
And this is my chance, I’m taking
All them old records, I’m breaking
All you people watching on the TV
You go ahead and put your bets on me, ay

[Pre-Chorus 2: Carrie Underwood]
I’ve been waiting my whole life
To see my name in lights

[Chorus: Carrie Underwood]
I am invincible, unbreakable
Unstoppable, unshakeable
They knock me down, I get up again
I am the champion, you’re gon’ know my name
You can’t hurt me now, I can’t feel the pain
I was made for this, yeah, I was born to win
I am the champion, oh

[Bridge: Ludacris]
Born champion, Luda!
The C is for the courage I possess through the trauma
H is for the hurt, but it’s all for the honor
A is for my attitude, working through the patience
Money comes and goes, so the M is for motivation
Gotta stay consistent, the P is to persevere
The I is for integrity, innovative career
The O is optimistic, open and never shut
And the N is necessary 'cause I’m never givin’ up
See, they ask me how I did it, I just did it from the heart
Crushin' the competition, been doing it from the start
They say that every champion is all about his principles
Carrie!

[Chorus: Carrie Underwood]
I am invincible, unbreakable
Unstoppable, unshakeable
They knock me down, I get up again
I am the champion, you’re gon’ know my name
You can’t hurt me now, I can’t feel the pain
I was made for this, yeah, I was born to win
I am the champion

[Outro: Ludacris & Carrie Underwood]
I’m the champion, yeah, surpassed all rivals
It’s all about who wants it the most
I am the champion, ohh
Fight for what we believe in
That’s what champions are made of
I am the champion (Yeah, champion)

[Verse 1]
A stray bullet and a mama  cries
Her baby won't be coming home tonight
Sirens screaming down the avenue
Just another story on the evening news, oh, whoa
Politics and prejudice
How the hell'd it'd ever come to this?
When everybody's gotta pick a side
It don't matter if you're wrong or right, no
And so it goes, but I hold onto hope and I won't let go 'cause

[Chorus]
I, I believe you and me are sisters and brothers
And I, I believe we're made to be here for each other
And we'll never fall if we walk hand in hand
Put a world that seems broken together again
Yeah I, I believe in the end love wins

[Verse 2]
Sometimes it takes a lot of faith
To keep believing there will come a day
When the tears and the sadness, the pain and the hate
The struggle, this madness, will all fade away, yeah

[Chorus]
I, I believe you and me are sisters and brothers
And I, I believe we're made to be here for each other
And we'll never fall if we walk hand in hand
Put a world that seems broken together again
Yeah I, I believe in the end love wins

[Bridge]
Love is power, love is a smile
Love reaches out, love is the remedy
Love is the answer, love's an open door
Love is the only thing worth fighting for, yeah

[Chorus]
I, I believe you and me are sisters and brothers
And I, I believe we're made to be here for each other
And we'll never fall if we walk hand in hand
Put a world that seems broken together again
Yeah I, I believe in the end love wins
Oh, yeah, love wins

[Outro]
Love will, love can, love still, love wins
Love will, love can, love still, love wins

[Verse 1]
She's a small-town, hard-workin' woman
Just tryna make a livin'
Workin' three jobs, feeding four little mouths
In a run-down kitchen
When you're never takin' nothin' and doin' nothin' but givin'
It's hard to be a good wife and a good mom and a good Christian

[Chorus]
She said, "I don't drink
But sometimes I need a stiff drink
Sippin' from a highball glass
Let the world fade away"
She said, "I don't smoke
But sometimes I need a long drag
Yeah, I know it might sound bad
But sometimes I need a smoke break"

[Verse 2]
He's a big-city, hard-workin' man just tryna climb the ladder
First generation to go to college instead of drivin' a tractor
Never had nothin' handed to him on a silver platter
It's hard to be a good man, good son
Do somethin' good that matters

[Chorus]
He said, "I don't drink
But sometimes I wanna pop that top
Take a swig and make the world stop
And watch it fade away"
He said, "I don't smoke
But sometimes I wanna light it up
Yeah, when things get tough
Sometimes I need a smoke break"
Yeah

[Middle 8]
So here's to you and here's to when the day gets long
Go ahead, I understand if you wanna take a load off

[Chorus]
I don't drink
But sometimes I need a stiff drink
Sipping from a highball glass
Let the world fade away
Yeah, and I don't smoke
But sometimes I need a long drag
Yeah, I know it might sound bad
But sometimes I need a, sometimes I need a

[Outro]
When the day gets long
When the work's all done
When the sun sets
When you need to forget
Grab that cup, mmm
Fill it up
Sip it slow
And let it all go
Ooh

[Verse 1]
She was driving last Friday on the way to Cincinnati
On a snow white Christmas Eve
Going home to see her Mama and her Daddy with the baby in the backseat
Fifty miles to go and she was running low on faith and gasoline
It'd been a long hard year
She had a lot on her mind and she didn't pay attention
She was going way too fast
Before she knew it, she was spinning on a thin black sheet of glass
She saw both their lives flash before her eyes
She didn't even have time to cry
She was so scared
She threw her hands up in the air

[Chorus]
Jesus, take the wheel
Take it from my hands
'Cause I can't do this on my own
I'm letting go
So give me one more chance
Save me from this road I'm on
Jesus, take the wheel

[Verse 2]
It was still getting colder when she made it to the shoulder
And the car came to a stop
She cried when she saw that baby in the backseat sleeping like a rock
And for the first time in a long time
She bowed her head to pray
She said, "I'm sorry for the way
I've been living my life
I know I've got to change
So from now on tonight"

[Chorus]
Jesus, take the wheel
Take it from my hands
'Cause I can't do this on my own
I'm letting go
So give me one more chance
Save me from this road I'm on
Oh, Jesus, take the wheel

[Bridge]
Oh, I'm letting go
So give me one more chance
Save me from this road I'm on
From this road I'm on
Jesus, take the wheel

[Outro]
Oh, take it, take it from me
Oh, wow, ooh

[Verse 1]
Dry lightning cracks across the skies
Those storm clouds gather in her eyes
Her daddy was a mean old mister
Mama was an angel in the ground
The weatherman called for a twister
She prayed blow it down

[Pre-Chorus]
There’s not enough rain in Oklahoma
To wash the sins out of that house
There’s not enough wind in Oklahoma
To rip the nails out of the past

[Chorus]
Shatter every window 'til it’s all blown away
Every brick, every board, every slamming door blown away
'Til there’s nothing left standing, nothing left of yesterday
Every tear-soaked whiskey memory blown away
Blown away

[Verse 2]
She heard those sirens screamin' out
Her daddy laid there, passed out on the couch
She locked herself in the cellar
Listened to the screaming of the wind
Some people called it taking shelter
She called it sweet revenge

[Chorus]
Shatter every window 'til it’s all blown away
Every brick, every board, every slamming door blown away
'Til there’s nothing left standing, nothing left of yesterday
Every tear-soaked whiskey memory blown away
Blown away

[Pre-Chorus]
There’s not enough rain in Oklahoma
To wash the sins out of that house
There’s not enough wind in Oklahoma
To rip the nails out of the past

[Chorus]
Shatter every window 'til it’s all blown away
Every brick, every board, every slamming door blown away
'Til there’s nothing left standing, nothing left of yesterday
Every tear-soaked whiskey memory blown away
Blown away

[Outro]
Blown away
Blown away
Blown away
Blown away

[Verse 1]
Jenny grew up wild, like a blackfoot daisy
Out in the shack with a blue tick hound
Broke as hell, but blessed with beauty
The kind that a rich man can't turn down
She caught the eye of an oil man dancing
One summer night in a dime store dress
She had the looks, he had the mansion
And you can figure out the rest

[Pre-Chorus]
It was all roses, drippin' in diamonds
Sippin' on champagne
She was all uptown, wearing that white gown
Takin' his last name

[Chorus]
She could hear those church bells ringin', ringin'
And up in the loft, that whole choir singin', singin'
Fold your hands and close your eyes
Yeah, it's all gonna be alright
And just listen to the church bells ringin', ringin'
Yeah, they're ringin'

[Verse 2]
Jenny was hosting Junior League parties
And havin' dinner at the country club
Everyone thought they were Ken and Barbie
But Ken was always gettin' way too drunk
Saturday night, after a few too many
He came home ready to fight
And all his money could never save Jenny
From the devil livin' in his eyes

[Pre-Chorus 2]
It was all bruises, covered in makeup
Dark sunglasses
And that next morning, sitting in the back pew
Praying with the baptist

[Chorus]
She could hear those church bells ringin', ringin'
And up in the loft, that whole choir singin', singin'
Fold your hands and close your eyes
Yeah, it's all gonna be alright
You just listen to the church bells ringin', ringin'
Yeah, they're ringin'

[Verse 3]
Jenny slipped somethin' in his Tennessee whiskey
No law man was ever gonna find
And how he died is still a mystery
But he hit a woman for the very last time

[Chorus]
She could hear those church bells ringin', ringin'
Standin' there in a black dress singin', singin'
Fold your hands and close your eyes
Yeah, it's all gonna be alright
And just listen to the church bells ringin', ringin'
Yeah, they're ringin'

[Verse 1]
That lipstick on your collar, well, it ain't my shade of pink
And I can tell by the smell of that perfume, it's like forty dollars too cheap
And there's a little wine stain on the pocket of your white cotton thread
Well, you drink beer and whiskey, boy, and you know I don't drink red

[Pre-Chorus]
Found it over in the corner
Wadded up on the bedroom floor
You shoulda hid it in the closet
You shoulda burned it, you shoulda lost it

[Chorus]
Now I'ma have to hang you out to dry, dry, dry
Clothespin all your secrets to the line, line, line
Leave 'em blowing in the wind, just say goodbye to you
All those midnights sneaking in
"I'm late again, oh, I'm so sorry"
All the Ajax in the world ain't gonna clean your dirty laundry

[Verse 2]
If the neighbors get to asking, I won't cover nothin' up
I'll tell 'em every little detail, how you drug me through the mud
I'm gonna string up your old button-down and slide it on the porch
Just in case you get the nerve to come knockin' on my door

[Chorus]
Yeah, I'ma have to hang you out to dry, dry, dry
Clothespin all your secrets to the line, line, line
Leave 'em blowing in the wind, just say goodbye to you
All those midnights sneaking in
"I'm late again, oh, I'm so sorry"
All the Ajax in the world ain't gonna clean your dirty laundry

[Pre-Chorus]
Found it over in the corner
Wadded up on the bedroom floor
You shoulda hid it in the closet
You shoulda burned it, you shoulda lost it

[Chorus]
Now I'ma have to hang you out to dry, dry, dry
Clothespin all your secrets to the line, line, line
Leave 'em blowing in the wind, just say goodbye to you
All those midnights sneaking in
"I'm late again, oh, I'm so sorry"
All the Ajax in the world ain't gonna clean your dirty laundry

[Outro]
(Out to dry)
(To the line)
(To the line)

[Verse 1]
I don't really care 'bout making any plans
Leave it up in the air, give it up to chance
Seein' where it goes, seein' where it lands
I just wanna go as fast as we can

[Chorus]
And we could end up broke down on some back road
Lovin' in the back seat to the radio
Wouldn't be the worst scenario
'Cause all I wanna do is end up with you
Get home and we're locked out
Middle of the backyard laying down
Last thing that I'd worry 'bout
'Cause all I wanna do is end up with you
Yeah, all I wanna do is end up with you

[Verse 2]
To the end of the world if you wanted to
Yeah, 'cause you could light up the dark side of the moon
Don't leave it up to me, I'll leave it up to you
'Cause I just want one thing when the night is through, yeah

[Chorus]
We could end up broke down on some back road
Lovin' in the back seat to the radio
Wouldn't be the worst scenario
'Cause all I wanna do is end up with you
Get home and we're locked out
Middle of the backyard laying down
Last thing that I'd worry 'bout
'Cause all I wanna do is end up with you
Yeah, all I wanna do is end up with you
All I wanna do is end up with you
All I wanna do is end up with you

[Bridge]
We could end up broke down on some back road
Lovin' in the back seat to the radio
Wouldn't be the worst scenario
'Cause all I wanna do is end up with you
Get home and we're locked out
Middle of the backyard laying down
Last thing that I'd worry 'bout
'Cause all I wanna do is end up with you
All I wanna do is end up with you
All I wanna do is end up with you
All I wanna do is end up with you

[Outro]
End up with you, end up with you
End up with you, end up with you
All I wanna do is end up with you
End up with you, end up with you
End up with you, end up with you
All I wanna do is end up with you
End up with you, end up with you
End up with you, end up with you
All I wanna do is end up with you
End up with you, end up with you
End up with you, end up with you
All I wanna do is end up with you, you, you, you

[Verse 1]
I love it when we're at a party in a downtown crowd, oh
But I can't hear you call me baby with the music up loud
Red wine, good times, no I don't mind being with everyone else
And then there's nights like tonight that I, I want you to myself

[Chorus]
And tonight, I wanna drive so far, we'll only find static on the radio
And we can't see those city lights and I love the way you look in a firefly glow
Saying everything without making a sound
A cricket choir in the background, underneath a harvest moon
Standing on your shoes in my bare feet
Dancing to the rhythm of your heartbeat
Oh whoa, and we're dancing to the rhythm of your heartbeat

[Verse 2]
I wanna feel it like a kick drum, beatin' faster in your chest
I wanna feel you holding onto me and make me hold my breath
You pull me closer, my head on your shoulder
Baby, we won't need a song
We'll make a fallen star wish, one more slow kiss
What are we waiting on?

[Chorus]
And tonight, I wanna drive so far, we'll only find static on the radio
And we can't see those city lights and I love the way you look in a firefly glow
Saying everything without making a sound
A cricket choir in the background, underneath a harvest moon
Standing on your shoes in my bare feet
Dancing to the rhythm of your heartbeat
Yeah, we're dancing to the rhythm of your heartbeat

[Bridge]
I wanna feel it like a kick drum, beatin' faster in your chest

[Chorus]
And tonight, I wanna drive so far, we'll only find static on the radio
And we can't see those city lights and I love the way you look in a firefly glow
Saying everything without making a sound, with the
River rolling in the background, underneath a harvest moon
Standing on your shoes in my bare feet
Dancing to the rhythm of your heartbeat
We're dancing to the rhythm of your heartbeat, oh

[Intro]
(Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
(Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)

[Verse 1]
Let me make one thing clear
You can buy me a beer, but you ain't taking me home
No pick up lines, I came here tonight to shed a few tears on my own
But sitting there across the room
I couldn't help but notice you seem a little down on your love too
Yeah, my heart might be breaking
But, this seat ain't taken
And you've got me thinkin'

[Chorus]
We should be drinking alone, together
Drownin' the pain is better
With somebody else who got problems
We ain't gonna solve 'em
But misery loves company
Tonight all I need is a stranger
Lips with a whiskey chaser
And a corner booth kiss to make me forget that he's gone
Oh, we should be drinking alone (Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
We should be drinking alone, together (Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)

[Verse 2]
I don't know what she did to make you hurt like this
But, I know just what to do
It starts with a bottle of good Reposado
And ends with a shooter or two
Tomorrow when the sun comes up
Tonight’s the night that never was
Baby, just forget my name
Won't be your one and only
But just 'cause we're lonely, don't mean that we should

[Chorus]
We should be drinking alone
'Cause drownin' the pain is better
With somebody else who got problems
We ain't gonna solve 'em
But misery loves company
Tonight all I need is a stranger
Lips with a whiskey chaser
And a corner booth kiss to make me forget that he's gone
Oh, we should be drinking alone
Drinking alone, drinking alone (Together)
Maybe we shouldn't be drinking alone (We should be drinking alone)
Drinking alone, drinking alone
Baby, we shouldn't be drinking alone

[Bridge]
I'll pretend that I care
Baby, pull up a chair
We'll stay here 'til they make us go home

[Chorus]
We should be drinking alone (Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
Oh, we should be drinking alone, together
Drownin' the pain is better
With somebody else who got problems
We ain't gonna solve 'em
But misery loves company
Tonight all I need is a stranger
Lips with a whiskey chaser
And a corner booth kiss to make me forget that he's gone
Oh, we should be drinking alone (Drinking alone, drinking alone) together
Maybe we shouldn't be drinking alone (We should be drinking alone)
Drinking alone, drinking alone
Baby, we shouldn't be drinking alone (Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)

[Outro]
We should be drinking alone
(Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
Ooh, ooh, ooh

[Verse 1]
Line of limousines leaves one by one
The prayers been prayed, the hymns been sung
Black mascara's already run
But the tears keep flowin'
You can blame it on hate or blame it on guns
But mama's ain't supposed to bury their sons
Left a hole in her heart and it still ain't done
The bullet keeps on goin'

[Chorus]
Through every branch of his family tree
Every birthday that he'll never see
Every chance to live a good life that was stolen
Through the son he'll never get to raise
His daughter on her wedding day
Wishin' it was his hands she was holdin'
'Till every heart that's left to break is broken
The bullet keeps on goin'

[Verse 2]
The grass grows back around the stone
And friends stop checkin' in on the phone
The camera crews have all moved on
But the wound's still open
The bullet keeps on goin'

[Chorus]
Through every branch of his family tree
Every birthday that he'll never see
Every chance to live a good life that was stolen
Through the son he'll never get to raise
His daughter on her wedding day
Wishin' it was his hands she was holdin'
'Till every heart that's left to break is broken
The bullet keeps on goin', yeah
Oh, whoa

[Bridge]
Line of limousines leaving one by one
The prayers been prayed, the hymns been sung
Oh, mama's ain't supposed to bury their sons
The bullet keeps on goin'

[Partial Chorus]
Through the son he'll never get to raise
His daughter on her wedding day
Wishin' it was his hands she was holdin'
'Till every heart that's left to break is broken
The bullet keeps on goin'
The bullet keeps on goin'

[Verse 1]
It was two weeks after the day she turned eighteen
All dressed in white
Going to the church that night
She had his box of letters in the passenger seat
Sixpence in a shoe
Something borrowed, something blue
And when the church doors opened up wide
She put her veil down
Trying to hide the tears
Oh, she just couldn't believe it
She heard the trumpets from the military band
And the flowers fell out of her hand

[Chorus]
Baby, why'd you leave me?
Why'd you have to go?
I was counting on forever, now I'll never know
I can't even breathe
It's like I'm looking from a distance
Standing in the background
Everybody's saying, he's not coming home now
This can't be happening to me
This is just a dream

[Verse 2]
The preacher man said, "Let us bow our heads and pray
Lord please lift his soul, and heal this hurt"
Then the congregation all stood up and sang the saddest song that she ever heard
Then they handed her a folded up flag
And she held on to all she had left of him
Oh, and what could have been
And then the guns rang one last shot
And it felt like a bullet in her heart

[Chorus]
Baby, why'd you leave me?
Why'd you have to go?
I was counting on forever, now I'll never know
I can't even breathe
It's like I'm looking from a distance
Standing in the background
Everybody's saying, he's not coming home now
This can't be happening to me
This is just a dream
Oh, baby, why'd you leave me?
Why'd you have to go?
I was counting on forever, now I'll never know
Oh, I'll never know
It's like I'm looking from a distance
Standing in the background
Everybody's saying, he's not coming home now
This can't be happening to me
This is just a dream

[Outro]
Oh, this is just a dream
Just a dream
Yeah, yeah

[Verse 1]
Don't wanna hear that stupid melody
The one we used to always keep playing on repeat
'Cause it just takes me to the place when you were mine
Where you laid my body down, and then got drunk on me like wine
Don't wanna feel that bass rattle in my bones
'Cause once I do, I know it won't leave me alone
It haunts me, baby, it does me wrong
But still, I just can't make myself delete it from my phone

[Chorus]
That song that we used to make love to
That song that we used to make love to
It kills me, heals me, gets me, thrills me
I know, I shouldn't say it, but I just wanna play it
That song that we made love to
That we made love to, yeah

[Verse 2]
I know I'm contradicting everything I said
But I wanna turn it up when I'm lyin' in this bed
Pull the sheets over my head
Drift off dreamin', baby, go on, let it take my breath

[Chorus]
That song that we used to make love to
That song that we used to make love to
It kills me, heals me, gets me, thrills me
I know I shouldn't say it, but I just wanna play it
That song (That song, that song)
That we made love to (That song, that song)
That we made love to, yeah

[Bridge]
Me and you, you and me
On repeat, on repeat
Me and you, you and me
On repeat, on repeat

[Chorus]
That song that we used to make love to
That song that we used to make love to
It breaks me, it makes me
Wanna hear it again and again and again
That song that we used to make love to
That song that we used to make love to
It kills me, heals me, gets me, thrills me
I know I shouldn't say it, but I just wanna play it
That song (That song, that song)
That we made love to (That song, that song)
That we made love to, yeah

[Outro]
That song, that song, that song
That song, that song, that song
That song, that song, that song
That song that we made love to, that we made love to, yeah

[Verse 1]
She's waiting, praying that he don't drive tonight
She's pacing the floor, she's checking the time
Wondering how the glow with that porch light hasn't gone out
'Cause it's been on now for three days straight
He’s been nowhere to be found
Probably drowning in the neon, where the wagon broke down
She called up his mama and his friends in town
But they ain't seen him
Another night of no sleepin'

[Chorus]
Round and around and around they go
Will it end? Nobody knows
She's all cried out on the kitchen floor
Spinnin' rooms, spinnin' wheels, spinnin' out of control
Spinnin' bottles, spinnin' bottles

[Verse 2]
He's in a hotel room with the TV on
Gettin' lost in the static with the curtains drawn
Knowin' this could be the time that gets her gone for good
He'd quit if he could
But one down, two down, three down, four
Can't even recognize the man in the mirror anymore

[Chorus]
Oh, 'round and around and around they go
Will it end? Nobody knows
He's passed out on the bathroom floor
Spinnin' rooms, spinnin' wheels, spinnin' out of control
Spinnin' bottles, spinnin' bottles

[Bridge]
This ain't a game
Nobody wins
Yeah, nobody gets lucky when that bottle spins
Again and again, again and again, again and again

[Chorus]
So, 'round and around and around they go
Will this end? Nobody knows
Can't live like this anymore
Spinnin' rooms, spinnin' wheels, spinnin' out of control
Spinnin' bottles, spinnin' bottles
Yeah, spinnin' bottles
Spinnin' bottles

[Verse 1]
O Lord my God, When I in awesome wonder
Consider all the worlds Thy Hands have made;
I see the stars, I hear the rolling thunder
Thy power throughout the universe displayed

[Chorus: Carrie Underwood and Vince Gill]
Then sings my soul, My Savior God, to Thee
How great Thou art, How great Thou art
Then sings my soul, My Savior God, to Thee
How great Thou art, How great Thou art!

[Guitar Solo: Vince Gill]

[Verse 2]
When Christ shall come, with shout of acclamation
And take me home, what joy shall fill my heart
Then I shall bow, in humble adoration
And then proclaim: "My God, how great Thou art!"

[Chorus]

How great Thou art, how great Thou art

[Verse 1]
It's two kids flying down the hall in the morning into our bedroom
It's a creaky board on the front porch
You swear you're gonna fix it soon
It's a kitchen table where we say our prayers
Give a little thanks to the man upstairs
It's the feeling I get, baby, when I look at you

[Chorus]
It ain't always pretty as a picture, yeah
And it ain't a mansion on a hill
It's perfectly imperfect
It's worth more than it's worth
It's our life, it's our heart, it's our home
This is our kingdom

[Verse 2]
It's been late nights, a few good fights
Wouldn't sleep until we worked things out
It's been long days of leanin' on faith
Even when we had our doubts
Barely gettin' by, stretched to the limits
All the hard times, no, I wouldn't trade a minute
We've come so far, it made us who we are
Right here, right now

[Chorus]
It ain't always pretty as a picture, yeah
And it ain't a mansion on a hill
It's perfectly imperfect
It's worth more than it's worth
It's our life, it's our heart, it's our home
And this is our kingdom
This is our, this is our, this is our kingdom
Oh, yeah, this is our kingdom

[Chorus]
No, it ain't always pretty as a picture, yeah
And it ain't a mansion on a hill
It's perfectly imperfect
It's worth more than it's worth
It's our life, it's our heart, it's our home
This is our kingdom
Oh, yeah
This is our, this is our kingdom
This is our kingdom

[Verse 3]
It's our names carved out on that old oak tree
Pictures on the wall of you and me
It's our heart, it's our home, it's our babies faces
It's the light, it's the love living in this place
It's church on Sunday, tire swings
Good and the bad times
Praying on our knees
Thanking the lord for this beautiful life
The love we have built will stand the test of time, yeah

[Outro]
Oh, this is our kingdom
This is our kingdom, yeah
This is our kingdom
It's pictures on the wall of you and me
Thanking the lord, praying on our knees
In our kingdom

[Verse 1]
Two black Cadillacs driving in a slow parade
Headlights shining bright in the middle of the day
One is for his wife
The other for the woman who loved him at night
Two black Cadillacs meeting for the first time

[Chorus]
And the preacher said he was a good man
And his brother said he was a good friend
But the women in the two black veils didn’t bother to cry
Bye bye, bye bye
Yeah they took turns laying a rose down
Threw a handful of dirt into the deep ground
He’s not the only one who had a secret to hide
Bye bye, bye bye, bye bye

[Break]
Two black Cadillacs
Two black Cadillacs

[Verse 2]
Two months ago, his wife called the number on his phone
Turns out he'd been lying to both of them for oh so long
They decided then, he’d never get away with doing this to them
Two black Cadillacs waiting for the right time, the right time

[Chorus]
And the preacher said he was a good man
And his brother said he was a good friend
But the women in the two black veils didn’t bother to cry
Bye bye, bye bye
Yeah, they took turns laying a rose down
Threw a handful of dirt into the deep ground
He’s not the only one who had a secret to hide
Bye bye, bye bye, bye bye
Yeah, yeah
Two black Cadillacs

[Bridge]
It was the first and the last time they saw each other face to face
They shared a crimson smile and just walked away
And left the secret at the grave

[Chorus]
And the preacher said he was a good man
And his brother said he was a good friend
But the women in the two black veils, they didn’t bother to cry
Bye bye, bye bye (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Yeah, they took turns laying a rose down
Threw a handful of dirt into the deep ground
He’s not the only one who had a secret to hide
Bye bye, bye bye, bye bye
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse 1]
I'm not supposed to be thinking 'bout you, lying here in this bed
Too much has gone wrong and we should move on
That's what we both said
There's a million reasons why we said goodbye
Why we couldn't try, couldn't fight for it anymore
Put your ring in the back of the dresser drawer
And we closed that door

[Chorus]
So why am I 2 A.M. pickin' up my phone
And you're standin' in my porch light
Backsliding
Wearin' your old t-shirt in the mornin', it feels so right
Backsliding
We say we won't, but then we do
The same old thing, fallin' right back in
Say it's gonna be the last time
Backsliding, I'm backsliding
Backsliding, I'm backsliding

[Verse 2]
Well, I heard that you've been hangin' around with someone new
Yeah, word gets around in such a small town
Bet you heard I'm seein' someone too
There's a million reasons why we should be happy
Not lookin' back, livin' in the past anymore
But they ain't addin' up, I guess they ain't enough
'Cause here I am

[Chorus]
At 2 A.M. pickin' up my phone
And you're standin' in my porch light
Backsliding
Wearin' your old t-shirt in the mornin', it feels so right
Backsliding
We say we won't, but then we do
The same old thing, fallin' right back in
Say it's gonna be the last time
Backsliding, I'm backsliding
Backsliding, I'm backsliding

[Bridge]
And we keep pushing, pulling back, sliding
Pushing, pulling, slipping back, sliding
I keep asking myself, keep asking myself
Why do I need you and nobody else?
And if we're not meant to be, then why do we keep backsliding?

[Chorus]
And why am I 2 A.M. pickin' up my phone
And you're standin' in my porch light
Backsliding
Wearin' your old t-shirt in the mornin', it feels so right
Backsliding
We say we won't, oh, but then we do
Yeah, the same old thing, fallin' right back in
Say it's gonna be the last time
Backsliding, I'm backsliding
Yeah, yeah
I'm backsliding, yeah
Backsliding

[Outro]
Why do we keep backsliding?
I can't help it, I'm backsliding
I need you, I'm backsliding
Why do we keep backsliding?
Backsliding
Backsliding
Backsliding
Backsliding

[Verse 1]
Hey, good girl (Hey, good girl)
With your head in the clouds
I bet you I can tell you what you’re thinking about
You'll see a good boy (You'll see a good boy)
Gonna give you the world
But he’s gonna leave you crying with your heart in the dirt
His lips are dripping honey, but he’ll sting you like a bee
So lock up all your love and go and throw away the key
Hey, good girl (Hey, good girl)
Get out while you can
I know you think you got a good man

[Chorus]
Why, why you gotta be so blind?
Won't you open up your eyes?
Just a matter of time 'til you find
He's no good, girl
No good for you
You better get to gettin' on your goodbye shoes and go, go, go
Better listen to me, he’s low, low, low

[Verse 2]
Hey, good girl (Hey, good girl)
You got a heart of gold
You want a white wedding and a hand you can hold
Just like you should, girl (Just like you should, girl)
Like every good girl does
Want a fairytale ending, somebody to love
But he’s really good at lying
Yeah, he’ll leave you in the dust
'Cause when he says forever
Well, it don’t mean much
Hey, good girl (Hey, good girl)
So good for him
Better back away, honey, you don’t know where he’s been

[Chorus]
Why, why you gotta be so blind?
Won't you open up your eyes?
Just a matter of time 'til you find
He's no good, girl
No good for you
You better get to gettin' on your goodbye shoes and go, go, go
Yeah, yeah, yeah, he’s low
Yeah, yeah, yeah

[Bridge]
Oh, he’s no good, girl
Why can’t you see?
He’ll take your heart and break it
Listen to me, yeah

[Chorus]
Why, why you gotta be so blind?
Won’t you open up your eyes?
Just a matter of time 'til you find
He’s no good, he’s no good
Won’t you open up your eyes?
Just a matter of time 'til you find

[Outro]
He’s no good, girl
No good for you
You better get to gettin' on your goodbye shoes

[Brad] [Verse 1]
We didn't care if people stared
We'd make out in a crowd somewhere
Somebody'd tell us to get a room
It's hard to believe that was me and you
Now we keep saying that we're okay
But I don't want to settle for good not great
I miss the way that it felt back then I want to feel that way again

[Verse 2]
[Brad] Been so long that you'd forget
The way I used to kiss your neck
[Carrie] Remind me, remind me
[Brad] So on fire so in love
Way back when we couldn't get enough
[Carrie] Remind me, remind me

[Carrie] [Verse 3]
Remember the airport dropping me off
We were kissing goodbye and we couldn't stop
[Brad] I felt bad because you missed your flight
[Carrie and Brad] But that meant we had one more night

[Carrie] [Verse 4]
Do you remember how it used to be
We'd turn out the lights and we didn't just sleep
[Brad] Remind me, baby, remind me
[Carrie]
Oh, so on fire so in love
That look in your eyes that I miss so much
[Brad] Remind me, baby, remind me

[Verse 5]
[Brad] I want to feel that way
[Carrie] Yeah, I want to hold you close
[Brad and Carrie]
Oh, if you still love me
Don't just assume I know

[Carrie] Baby, remind me, remind me

[Verse 6]
[Carrie] Do you remember the way it felt?
[Brad] You mean back when we couldn't control ourselves
[Carrie] Remind me
[Brad] Yeah, remind me
[Carrie]
All those things that you used to do
That made me fall in love with you
Remind me, oh, baby, remind me

[Brad] [Verse 7]
Yeah, you'd waked up in my old T-shirt
All those mornings I was late for work
Remind me

[Brad and Carrie] Oh, baby, remind me

[Outro]
[Carrie] Oh, baby, remind me, baby, remind me
[Brad] Yeah, you'd waked up in my old T-shirt
[Carrie] Remind me, yeah, oh
[Brad] Baby, remind me

[Verse 1]
We got a pontoon boat with a Yamaha
People dressed like they're in Panama
Small town, spring break
Every weekend 'round this place
And there's a bunch of boys tryna catch the eyes
Of all the pretty girls that are walking by
And those redneck margaritas are two for one at that old marina, yeah
Tan lines and gas station cheap sunglasses
They're coming here from all around

[Chorus]
To get a little southbound, unwound, Tennessee Honey kinda buzz
Them south sounds up loud, summer drippin' off of us
From the river bank to the Party Cove
Long as it floats, we'll rock the boat
And it's all lookin' up when we get down, yeah
And get a little southbound, southbound
Get a little southbound, southbound

[Verse 2]
Bo got a ticket in a no-wake zone
But Katie's the one that should take it slow
'Cause she's dancin' on the dock and it's only 2 o'clock
Yeah, the fish ain't bitin' 'cause the party's on
The old men are thinkin' 'bout goin' home
But those redneck margaritas are two for one at that old marina, yeah

[Chorus]
We're gonna get a little southbound, unwound, Tennessee Honey kinda buzz
Them south sounds up loud, summer drippin' off of us
From the river bank to the Party Cove
Long as it floats, we'll rock the boat
And it's all lookin' up when we get down, yeah
And get a little southbound, southbound
Get a little southbound, southbound
Oh, yeah
Woo!

[Bridge]
Yeah, we got the rope swing swingin' like a chandelier
Little bit of heaven on the water ride here
Don't need much, just a couple of beers and you and me
Gotta love this time of year
Getting southbound, southbound

[Chorus]
So let's get a little southbound, unwound, Tennessee Honey kinda buzz
Them south sounds up loud, summer drippin' off of us
From the river bank to the Party Cove
Long as it floats, we'll rock the boat
And it's all lookin' up when we get down
And get a little southbound, southbound
Get a little southbound, southbound
Let's get a little southbound, southbound
Get a little southbound, southbound
Oh, yeah

[Verse 1]
You think I'm crying over you
You think I'm dying too
You think I'm thinking way too much
And sadly out of touch
With all the world and all my friends, well, think what you want and think again, think again

[Chorus]
'Cause what you don't know is I'm throwin' a party
And everybody tonight is feelin' alright, with some Jack in their Coke
The records are spinnin' and the speakers are smokin'
There ain't no last call, I'm havin' a ball with Hank Haggard and Jones
No, I ain't alone
I feel right at home with my ghosts on the stereo

[Verse 2]
There ain't no lights on, the curtains drawn
Just one car in the drive
And the neighbors might think it's a haunted house, yeah
But I've never felt so alive

[Chorus]
'Cause what they don't know is I'm throwin' a party
And everybody tonight is feelin' alright, with some Jack in their Coke
The records are spinnin' and the speakers are smokin'
There ain't no last call, I'm havin' a ball with Hank Haggard and Jones
No, I ain't alone
I feel right at home with my ghosts on the stereo
With my ghosts on the stereo

[Bridge]
One song at a time, I get their advice
And the pain melts away like whiskey on ice

[Chorus]
Baby, you don't know that I'm throwin' a party
And everybody tonight is feelin' alright, with some Jack in their Coke
Yeah, the records are spinnin' and the speakers are smokin'
There ain't no last call, I'm havin' a ball with Hank Haggard and Jones
No, I ain't alone
I feel right at home with my ghosts on the stereo
Oh, yeah, with my ghosts on the stereo
Yeah
Oh, yeah, I've got my ghosts on the stereo

[Verse 1]
In between the coats in the closet
She held on to that heart shaped locket
Staring at a family flawless
But it ain't a pretty picture tonight
Mom and daddy just wouldn't stop it
Fighting at the drop of a faucet
Cuts through the walls catastrophic
She's caught in the crossfire (Crossfire)
Puts her hands over her ears
Starts talking through her tears
She's sayin', and she's prayin'

[Chorus]
I wish words were like little toy guns
No sting, no hurt, no one
Just a bang bang rollin' off your tongue
(I wish words were like little toy guns)
Yeah, no smoke, no bullets
No kick from the trigger when you pull it
No pain, no damage done
(I wish words were like little toy guns)
And just a bang bang rollin' off your tongue
(I wish words were like little toy guns)

[Verse 2]
Wish there was a white flag waving
Or that they were both just faking
And it was just a game they were playing like shoot 'em up cowboys
Leave the plastic pistols in the front yard
Throw away the score card and just turn off all the noise

[Chorus]
I wish words were like little toy guns
No sting, no hurt, no one
Just a bang bang rollin' off your tongue
(I wish words were like little toy guns)
Yeah, no smoke, no bullets
No kick from the trigger when you pull it
No pain, no damage done
(I wish words were like little toy guns)
And just a bang bang rollin' off your tongue
(I wish words were like little toy guns)

[Bridge]
Toy guns
Ohh, I wish they didn't cut like a knife (Like a knife)
I wish they didn't break you inside (Break you inside)
I wish they didn't bang bang make you wanna run, yeah

[Chorus]
Like little toy guns
No sting, no hurt, no one
Just a bang bang rollin' off your tongue
(I wish words were like little toy guns)
Yeah, no smoke, no bullets
No shot from the trigger when you pull it
No pain, no damage done
(I wish words were like little toy guns)
And just a bang bang rollin' off your tongue
(I wish words were like little toy guns)

[Outro]
Toy guns
Oh, like little toy guns

[Verse 1]
Said goodbye, turned around
And you were gone, gone, gone
Faded into the setting sun
Slipped away
But I won’t cry, 'cause I know I’ll never be lonely
For you are the stars to me
You are the light I follow

[Chorus]
I will see you again, oh
This is not where it ends
I will carry you with me, oh
'Til I see you again

[Verse 2]
I can hear those echoes in the wind at night
Calling me back in time
Back to you
In a place far away where the water meets the sky
The thought of it makes me smile
You are my tomorrow

[Chorus]
I will see you again, oh
This is not where it ends
I will carry you with me, oh
'Til I see you again

[Bridge]
Sometimes I feel my heart is breaking
But I stay strong and I hold on 'cause I know
I will see you again, oh
This is not where it ends
I will carry you with me, yeah, yeah

[Chorus]
I will see you again, oh
This is not where it ends
I will carry you with me, oh
'Til I see you again

[Outro]
'Til I see you again
'Til I see you again
Yeah, yeah, oh
Said goodbye, turned around
And you were gone, gone, gone

[Verse 1]
Little princess, summer flowers in her hair
Playing "Ring Around the Rosie" in a picture there
Tiptoeing 'round the house in her mama's shoes
Coloring her lips red in her bedroom

[Verse 2]
Prom queen wants to be like the magazines
Thinks she found her king, barely seventeen
Too much that the world's wanting you to do
When you're still just a child in your mama's shoes

[Chorus]
Little girl, little girl, don't grow up too fast
'Fore you know it, you'll be wishing you could just go back
Don't you know there'll be plenty of time for that?
Somewhere down the road
Yeah, it's all gonna fly in the blink of an eye
You can't slow down this thing called life
So take your time and let it last
Little girl, don't grow up too fast
Yeah, yeah

[Verse 3]
Sometimes I feel like I'm hanging on by a thread
Climbing ladders trying to get to the next step
Working hard, always wanting something more
Missing how things were simple like it was before

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause it's hard to know just what to do
When I still feel like a child in my mama's shoes

[Chorus]
Little girl, little girl, don't grow up too fast
'Fore you know it, you'll be wishing you could just go back
Don't you know there'll be plenty of time for that
Somewhere down the road?
Yeah, it's all gonna fly in the blink of an eye
You can't slow down this thing called life
So take your time and let it last
Little girl, don't grow up too fast
Ooh, yeah

[Bridge]
Sometimes I wish I could just go back and say
"Take your time and let it last, little girl"

[Chorus]
Yeah, it's all gonna fly in the blink of an eye
You can't slow down this thing called life
So take your time and let it last
Little girl, don't grow up too fast
Little girl, don't grow up too fast
Yeah, yeah

[Intro]
Oh, oh
Oh, oh
Oh, oh

[Verse 1]
You better take it from me
That boy is like a disease
You're running, you're trying, you're trying to hide
And you're wondering why you can't get free
He's like a curse, he's like a drug
You'll get addicted to his love
You wanna get out, but he's holding you down
'Cause you can't live without one more touch

[Chorus]
He's a, a good time cowboy Casanova
Leaning up against the record machine
He looks like a cool drink of water, but he's candy-coated misery
He's the Devil in disguise, a snake with blue eyes
And he only comes out at night
Gives you feelings that you don't wanna fight
You better run for your life

[Post-Chorus]
Oh, oh
Oh, oh
Oh, oh

[Verse 2]
I see that look on your face
You ain't hearing what I say
So I'll say it again, 'cause I been where you been
And I know how it ends, you can't get away-ay-ay
Don't even look in his eyes
He'll tell you nothing but lies
And you wanna believe, but you won't be deceived
If you listen to me and take my advice

[Chorus]
He's a, a good time cowboy Casanova
Leaning up against the record machine
He looks like a cool drink of water, but he's candy-coated misery
He's the Devil in disguise, a snake with blue eyes
And he only comes out at night
Gives you feelings that you don't wanna fight
You better run for your life

[Bridge]
Run, run away
Don't let him mess with your mind
He'll tell you anything you wanna hear
He'll break your heart, it's just a matter of time
But just remember

[Chorus]
He's a, a good time cowboy Casanova
Leaning up against the record machine
He looks like a cool drink of water, but he's candy-coated misery
He's the Devil in disguise, a snake with blue eyes
And he only comes out at night
Gives you feelings that you don't wanna fight
You better run for your life

[Outro]
(Oh, oh)
Oh, you better run for your life
(Oh, oh)
Oh, you better run for your life

[Intro]
(Yeah, yeah)
(Yeah, yeah)

[Verse 1]
Never was the kind to think about dressing in white
Wasn't waiting on a prince to come riding into my life
Thought I was happy on my own
'Til you came and proved me wrong

[Chorus]
I finally found what I never knew I always wanted
I couldn't see; I was blind 'til my eyes were opened
I didn't know there was a hole
Something missing in my soul
'Til you filled it up with your love, yeah
(Yeah, yeah)

[Verse 2]
Never pictured myself singing lullabies
Sittin' in a rocking chair in the middle of the night
In the quiet, in the dark
You're stealing every bit of my heart with your daddy's eyes
What a sweet surprise

[Chorus]
And now I'm holdin' what I never knew I always wanted
I couldn't see; I was blind 'til my eyes were opened
I didn't know there was a hole
Something missing in my soul
'Til you filled it up, oh, with your love

[Bridge]
Life has a way of showing you just what you need
And who you were made to be, yeah

[Chorus]
I finally found what I never knew I always wanted
I couldn't see; I was blind 'til my eyes were opened
I didn't know there was a hole
Something missing in my soul
'Til you filled it up with your love
Yeah, you filled it up with your love, yeah
(Yeah, yeah)
(Yeah, yeah)

[Outro]
I never was the kind to think about dressing in white
I never pictured myself singing lullabies

[Verse 1]
Like a cigarette without a light
Like a whippoorwill without the night
A broken buzz that's lost its high
Oh, baby, that's what I feel like

[Chorus]
I'm so low
I'm so low

[Verse 2]
Like a diamond ring without a stone
Like a guitar without a song
Everything that was right is wrong
Ever since, baby, you been gone

[Chorus]
I'm so low
I'm so low
Yeah, I'm low and blue
I'm so lonesome for you

[Post-Chorus]
Oh, yeah
Oh, whoa, oh
Yeah, yeah

[Bridge]
Oh, I've hit rock bottom, I'm in it deep
I can't get no air, I can't get no sleep, without you by my side
I tried to see the light, baby, but I can't
'Cause way down here in the world where I am, the sun don't shine

[Chorus]
'Cause I'm low, low, low, low
I'm so low
I'm so tangled up and blue
I'm so lonesome for you
And I don't know what to do
'Cause I'm so lonesome for you
Yeah, I'm lonesome for you

[Verse 1]
He said, "I've been where you've been before
Down every hallway's a slamming door"
No way out, no one to come and save me
Wasting a life that the Good Lord gave me

[Verse 2]
Then somebody said what I'm saying to you
Opened my eyes and told me the truth
They said, "Just a little faith, it'll all get better"
So I followed that preacher man down to the river and now I'm

[Pre-Chorus]
Changed
And now I'm stronger

[Chorus]
There must've been something in the water
Oh, there must've been something in the water

[Verse 3]
And well, I heard what he said and I went on my way
Didn't think about it for a couple of days
Then it hit me like a lightning late one night
I was all out of hope and all out of fight

[Verse 4]
Couldn't fight back the tears, so I fell on my knees
Saying, "God, if you're there, come and rescue me."
Felt love pouring down from above
Got washed in the water, washed in the blood and now I'm

[Pre-Chorus]
Changed
And now I'm stronger

[Chorus]
There must be something in the water
Oh, there must be something in the water

[Bridge]
And now I'm singing along to Amazing Grace
Can't nobody wipe this smile off my face
Got joy in my heart, angels on my side
Thank God almighty, I saw the light
Gonna look ahead, no turning back
Live every day, give it all that I have
Trust in someone bigger than me
Ever since the day that I believed I am changed
And now I'm stronger

[Chorus]
There must be something in the water (Amazing grace)
Oh, there must be something in the water (How sweet the sound)
Oh, there must be something in the water (That saved a wretch)
Oh, there must be something in the water (Like me)
Oh, yeah

[Outro]
(I once was lost)
I am changed
Stronger
(But now I'm found)
Was blind, but now I see

[Verse 1]
Front row center in that little white church
I was singing at a baby laying in a manger
Eight years old wearing angel wings
Yeah, and to this day, that's what you see

[Verse 2]
I've been daddy's little girl since my first cry
And it was hard turning eighteen, saying goodbye
You told me I was gonna take the world by storm
And mama said you cried all the way home

[Chorus 1]
You think I'm strong, you think I'm fearless
Even when I'm, I'm in my weakest
You always see the best in me when I can't
I wanna be the girl you think I am

[Verse 3]
I got my flaws and I've got regrets
And I know there's more on the road ahead
When I wonder if I'll ever measure up
Oh, I thank God for a father's love

[Chorus 2]
'Cause you think I'm brave, and you think I'm beautiful
You think that I can do the impossible
You always see the best in me when I can't
I wanna be the girl you think I am

[Bridge]
Oh, whoa
Oh, whoa
The girl you think I am
Yeah, ooh
Ooh, yeah

[Verse 4]
All I want, more than anything
Is to make you proud of me

[Chorus 3]
'Cause you think I'm strong, and you think I'm fearless
Even when I'm, I'm at my weakest
You believe in me
Yeah, you're my biggest fan
So I wanna be the girl you think I am
I wanna be the girl you think I am

[Verse 1]
If anyone asks, you never saw me
And I know you know better than to call me
Let's just hide out under the covers
One more secret between two old lovers
What can it hurt?

[Pre-Chorus]
I ain't hung up on you
I ain't in love with you
This is just time that I'm wasting
One or two little sips
I'm alright, I can quit
You're just someone that I've tasted

[Chorus]
I don't have to have you
I don't need to need you
Just a high that I'm chasing
Don't think I'm coming back
It's just a relapse

[Verse 2]
I know I said, I said it was over
But it's hard when I miss you to stay sober
So if I show up here at your door again
Oh, it's just me falling off of the wagon
What can it hurt?

[Pre-Chorus]
I ain't hung up on you
I ain't in love with you
This is just time that I'm wasting
One or two little sips
I'm alright, I can quit
You're just someone that I've tasted

[Chorus]
I don't have to have you
I don't need to need you
Just a high that I'm chasing
Don't think I'm coming back
It's just a relapse

[Bridge]
I can quit when I'm ready (I can quit)
I ain't hurting nobody but me

[Pre-Chorus]
I ain't hung up on you
I ain't in love with you
This is just time that I'm wasting
One or two little sips
I'm alright, I can quit
You're just someone that I've tasted

[Chorus]
I don't have to have you
I don't need to need you
Just a high that I'm chasing
Don't think I'm coming back
It's just a relapse
Oh, no
Don't think I'm coming back
It's just a relapse

[Intro]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse 1]
Since the day they got married
He'd been praying for a little baby boy
Someone he could take fishing
Throw the football and be his pride and joy
He could already see him holding that trophy
Taking his team to state
But when the nurse came in with a little pink blanket
All those big dreams changed

[Chorus]
And now he's wrapped around her finger
She's the center of his whole world
And his heart belongs to that sweet little
Beautiful, wonderful, perfect All-American girl

[Verse 2]
Sixteen short years later
She was falling for the senior football star
Before you knew it, he was dropping passes
Skipping practice just to spend more time with her
The coach said, "Hey, son, what's your problem?
Tell me, have you lost your mind?"
And Daddy said, "You'll lose your free ride to college
Boy, you better tell her goodbye"

[Chorus]
But now he's wrapped around her finger
She's the center of his whole world
And his heart belongs to that sweet little
Beautiful, wonderful, perfect All-American

[Bridge]
And when they got married and decided to have one of their own
She said, "Be honest, tell me what you want"
And he said, "Honey, you oughta know
Sweet little, beautiful, one just like you
Oh, a beautiful, wonderful, perfect All-American"

[Chorus]
Now he's wrapped around her finger
She's the center of his whole world
And his heart belongs to that sweet little
Beautiful, wonderful, perfect All-American girl

[Outro]
All-American girl

[Verse 1]
Well, life's been kind of trippy down here in Mississippi
Since Cassie O'Grady disappeared
And me and Bobby Shaver been in all the newspapers
Every day for nigh on a year
They say we got tangled in a love triangle
A fatal game of truth or dare

[Chorus]
But the truth remains a mystery and now it's ancient history
It's a Choctaw County affair
It's just a Choctaw County affair (Choctaw County affair)
Well, people talkin' 'bout it everywhere (Choctaw County affair)

[Verse 2]
Well, Cassie O'Grady was no Southern lady
Despite all the media hype
They all loved to make her out like a sweet little devout
All-American cheerleader type
But her mind was cattywampus
She was greedy, she was pompous
Strutting 'round with her nose in the air

[Chorus]
She was a cold gold-digger tickling a hair trigger
It's a Choctaw County affair
It's just a Choctaw County affair (Choctaw County affair)
And now they say she's lying dead somewhere (Choctaw County affair)

[Verse 3]
Well, I do not deny, I wished Cassie would die
When she threatened us with blackmail
She said she had some information that would wreck my reputation
And land Bobby back in jail
Now it's best to remember Bobby Shaver's got a temper
Like a buck-shot grizzly bear

[Chorus]
But there's no body, there's no witness
So y'all go mind your business
It's a Choctaw County affair
It's just a Choctaw County affair (Choctaw County affair)
Oh, you mess with Bobby and you better beware (Choctaw County affair)
Yeah yeah-yeah
Hey, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse 4]
Well, the press went wild on the day of the trial
When they put us on the witness stand
They thought we'd turn on each other, but soon they all discovered
We would live or die, hand in hand
And that fancy D.A. from down Jackson way
Said he'd see us in the electric chair, ha

[Chorus]
But the foreman of the jury told me "Honey, don't you worry, it's a Choctaw county affair", yeah
(Choctaw County affair)
Yeah, it's just a Choctaw County affair (Choctaw County affair), yeah
How would you know 'cause you weren't there (Choctaw County affair)
It's just a Choctaw County affair (Choctaw County affair)
Mmm, yeah, yeah (Choctaw County affair)

[Verse 1]
Little boy, six years old
A little too used to being alone
Another new mom and dad
Another school, another house that will never be home
When people ask him how he likes this place
He looks up and says with a smile upon his face

[Chorus]
This is my temporary home, it's not where I belong
Windows and rooms that I'm passing through
This is just a stop on the way to where I'm going
I'm not afraid because I know
This is my temporary home

[Verse 2]
Young mom, on her own
She needs a little help, got nowhere to go
She's looking for a job, looking for a way out
'Cause a half-way house will never be a home
At night, she whispers to her baby girl
"Someday we'll find our place here in this world"

[Chorus]
This is our temporary home, it's not where we belong
Windows and rooms that we're passing through
This is just a stop on the way to where we're going
I'm not afraid because I know
This is our temporary home

[Verse 3]
Old man, hospital bed
The room is filled with people he loves
And he whispers, "Don't cry for me, I'll see you all someday"
He looks up and says, "I can see God's face"

[Chorus]
This is my temporary home, it's not where I belong
Windows and rooms that I'm passing through
This was just a stop on the way to where I'm going
I'm not afraid because I know
This was my temporary home

[Outro]
This is our temporary home

[Verse 1]
Last night, I got served a little bit too much of that poison, baby
Last night, I did things I'm not proud of
And I got a little crazy
Last night, I met a guy on the dance floor
And I let him call me baby

[Chorus 1]
And I don't even know his last name
My mama would be so ashamed
It started off, "Hey, cutie, where you from?"
And then it turned into, "Oh, no, what have I done?"
And I don't even know his last name
Woo!

[Verse 2]
We left the club, right around three o'clock in the morning
His Pinto, sitting there, in the parking lot
When it should've been a warning
I had no clue what I was getting into
So, I'll blame it on the Cuervo
Oh, where did my manners go?

[Chorus 1]
And I don't even know his last name
Oh, my mama would be so ashamed
It started off, "Hey, cutie, where you from?"
And then it turned into, "Oh, no, what have I done?"
And I don't even know his last name
Here we go!

[Bridge]
Today, I woke up thinking about Elvis somewhere in Vegas
I'm not sure how I got here
Or how this ring on my left hand just appeared outta nowhere
I gotta go
I take the chips and the Pinto and hit the road
They say what happens here, stays here, all of this will disappear
There's just one little problem

[Chorus 2]
I don't even know my last name
Oh, my mama would be so ashamed
It started off, "Hey, cutie, where you from?"
And then it turned into, "Oh, no! What have I done?"
And I don't even know my last name

[Breakdown]
What have I done?
What have I done?
What have I done?
Oh, what have I done?
I don't even know my last name
Well, it turned into, "Oh no, what have I done?"
And I don't even know my last name
Hey, yeah, yeah
Yeah-eh, yeah-eh, yeah-eh, yeah-eh, yeah-eh, oh

[Outro]
It started off, "Hey cutie, where you from?"
And then it turned into, "Oh no, what have I done?"
And I don't even know my last name
Oh, yeah

[Verse 1]
Mama, you taught me to do the right things
So now you have to let your baby fly
You've given me everything that I will need
To make it through this crazy thing called life

[Pre-Chorus]
And I know you watched me grow up
And only want what's best for me
And I think I found the answer to your prayers

[Chorus]
And he is good, so good
He treats your little girl like a real man should
He is good, so good
He makes promises he keeps
No, he's never gonna leave
So don't you worry about me
Don't you worry about me

[Verse 2]
Mama, there's no way you'll ever lose me
Giving me away is not goodbye
As you watch me walk down to my future
I hope tears of joy are in your eyes

[Chorus]
'Cause he is good, so good
And he treats your little girl like a real man should
He is good, so good
He makes promises he keeps
No, he's never gonna leave
So don't you worry about me
Don't you worry about me

[Bridge]
And when I watch my baby grow up
I only want what's best for her
And I hope she'll find the answer to our prayers
And that she'll say

[Chorus]
He is good, so good
And he treats your little girl like a real man should
He is good, so good
He makes promises he keeps
No, he's never gonna leave
So don't you worry about me
Don't you worry about me

[Outro]
Mama, don't you worry about me
Don't you worry about me

[Verse 1]
Standin' at the back door
She tried to make it fast
One tear hit the hardwood
It fell like broken glass
She said sometimes love slips away
And you just can’t get it back
Let’s face it
For one split second
She almost turned around
But that would be like pouring raindrops
Back into a cloud
So she took another step
And said, "I see the way out and I‘m gonna take it"

[Chorus]
I don’t wanna spend my life jaded
Waiting to wake up one day and find
That I let all these years go by
Wasted

[Verse 2]
Another glass of whiskey, but it still don’t kill the pain
So he stumbles to the sink and pours it down the drain
He said, "It's time to be a man and stop living for yesterday
Gotta face it"

[Chorus]
'Cause I don’t wanna spend my life jaded
Waiting to wake up one day and find
That I let all these years go by
Wasted
Oh, I don’t wanna keep on wishin', missin'
The still of the morning, the color of the night
I ain’t spendin' no more time
Wasted

[Bridge]
She kept driving along
Till the moon and the sun were floatin' side-by-side
He looked in the mirror and his eyes were clear
For the first time in a while
Hey, yeah

[Chorus]
Oh, I don’t wanna spend my life jaded
Waiting to wake up one day and find
That I let all these years go by
Wasted
Oh, I don’t wanna keep on wishin', missin'
The still of the morning, the color of the night
I ain’t spendin' no more time
Wasted
Oh, I don’t wanna spend my life jaded
Waitin' to wake up one day and find
That I let all these years go by
Wasted
Yeah, yeah
Oh, I don’t wanna keep on wishin', missin'
The still of the morning, the color of the night
I ain’t spendin' no more time
Wasted

[Verse 1]
Looks like an angel, so picturesque
Looks like she walked right out of the wild, wild west
She's a devil in a satin dress
You don't even know her hair trigger's aimin' right at your chest
By the time you figure out that she gave you the runaround
You won't know where she's at
She's a tumbleweed blowin' in the wind come sundown
Call a girl like that

[Chorus]
Renegade runaway
She's a sure shot, knock the ash off a smokin' cigarette
Yeah, that pretty face
Love you, leave you, play you like a heartbreak bandit
She's an outlaw, a quick draw
She'll take it all, so don't you fall
For that renegade
Runaway, runaway, runaway, runaway
You better run away, run away, run away, run away

[Verse 2]
You'll see her name, alive or dead
Yeah, they'll take her either way cause she's wanted
If I were you, I'd place my bet
That she's ridin' off out into the sunset
With her long hair flyin' 'cross the desert dirt
Let me tell you, boy, you're never gonna catch her

[Chorus]
Renegade runaway
She's a sure shot, knock the ash off a smokin' cigarette
Yeah, that pretty face
Love you, leave you, play you like a heartbreak bandit
She's an outlaw, a quick draw
She'll take it all, so don't you fall
For that renegade
Runaway, runaway, runaway, runaway
Oh baby, run away

[Bridge]
Young gunslinger makin' you a mess
Tough as nails under that corset
Call her renegade
Runaway, runaway, runaway

[Chorus]
Yeah, that pretty face
Love you, leave you, play you like a heartbreak bandit
She's an outlaw, a quick draw
She'll take it all, so don't you fall
For that renegade
Runaway, runaway, runaway, runaway
You better run away, run away, run away, run away
She's a renegade

[Verse 1]
It's been a wreck me week
Sixty plus from dawn to dusk
In the red dirt heat
Busting it up for a couple of bucks
But it ain't no thing
Just another day 'til I'm on my way
To them cool, cool sheets and you and me

[Chorus]
Working on the night shift, baby
Dying for your touch like crazy
Racking up the overtime hours
Loving how we're working on the night shift, baby

[Verse 2]
Gonna rock it right
No need to talk, I know what you want
And what you like
'Cause I do too, yeah
I love how you leave on the lights
Not a thing between you and me
And it feels so nice when you and I are

[Chorus]
Working on the night shift, baby
Dying for your touch like crazy
Racking up the overtime hours
Loving how we're working on the night shift, baby

[Bridge]
Yeah, yeah
It's been a wreck me week
Oh, but who needs sleep?

[Chorus]
When you're working on the night shift, baby
Dying for your touch like crazy
Racking up the overtime hours
Loving how we're working on the night shift, baby
Loving how we're working on the night shift
Loving how we're working on the night shift
Working on the night shift, baby

[Verse 1]
Been up since the crack of dawn
Just trying to get paid
Been hotter than a hundred suns
I can't find no shade
Just two more rows and I'm good to go
Yeah, I'm shutting this tractor down
Give me a half an hour for a shave and a shower
And I'll be outside your house

[Chorus]
Might have a little dirt on my boots
But I'm takin' you uptown tonight
Might have a little mud on my wheels
But they're gonna shine with you up inside
Gonna hit the club, gonna cut a rug
Burn it up like neon lights
Might have a little dirt on my boots
But we're gonna dance the dust right off them tonight
Got a little dirt on my boots

[Verse 2]
Hard as I worked all day
I'm gonna work harder loving on you
Spin you all over that dance floor
Right out of them high heel shoes
And when you're ready to quit
Baby, we can slip right out of that barroom door
And when I take you home, don't worry babe
I'm gonna kick them off on the porch

[Chorus]
Might have a little dirt on my boots
But I'm taking you uptown tonight
Might have a little mud on my wheels
But they're gonna shine with you up inside
Gonna hit the club, gonna cut a rug
Burn it up like neon lights
Might have a little dirt on my boots
But we're gonna dance the dust right off them tonight
Got a little dirt on my boots

[Bridge]
A little dirty dancing, blue collar romancing
I can get cleaned up if you ask me
But I can only get so fancy

[Chorus]
Got a little dirt on my boots
But I'm taking you uptown tonight
Might have a little mud on my wheels
But they're gonna shine with you're up inside
Gonna hit the club, gonna cut a rug
Burn it up like neon lights
Might have a little dirt on my boots
But we're gonna dance the dust right off them tonight
Got a little dirt on my boots
Got a little dirt on my boots
Got a little dirt on my boots

[Verse 1]
Same old dive, same old end of the work week drink
Bartender knows my name, but I don't mind
She kicks 'em up strong, serves me up right

[Chorus]
And here I go again, I'm drinkin' one, I'm drinkin' two
I got my heartache medication, a strong dedication
To gettin' over you, turnin' me loose
On that hardwood jukebox lost in neon time
My heartache medication, well, it suits me fine
And I'm drinkin' enough to take you off my mind
I got my heartache medication

[Verse 2]
Another girl, another dance to a country song
Turnin' me on, here's to a good time
And halfway to feelin' alright

[Chorus]
And here I go again, I'm drinkin' one, I'm drinkin' two
I got my heartache medication, a strong dedication
To gettin' over you, turnin' me loose
On that hardwood jukebox lost in neon time
My heartache medication, well it suits me fine
And I'm drinkin' enough to take you off my mind
I got my heartache medication

[Bridge]
Single, drinkin' doubles
Teardrops turnin' into bubbles
Yeah, a little later on
I'll probably find me some trouble

[Chorus]
And here I go again, I'm drinkin' one, I'm drinkin' two
I got my heartache medication, a strong dedication
To gettin' over you, turnin' me loose
On that hardwood jukebox lost in neon time
My heartache medication, well it suits me fine
And I'm drinkin' enough to take you off my mind
I got my heartache medication

[Outro]
Heartache medication takin' me away
Oh whoa

[Verse 1]
I wanna sweep you off your feet tonight
I wanna love you and hold you tight
Spin you around on some old dance floor
Act like we never met before for fun

[Chorus]
'Cause you're the one I want
You're the one I need
Baby, if I was a king
Ah, you would be my queen
You're the rock in my roll
You're good for my soul, it's true
I'm head over boots for you

[Verse 2]
The way you sparkle like a diamond ring
Maybe one day we can make it a thing
Test time and grow old together
Rock in our chairs and talk about the weather, yeah
So, bring it on in for that angel kiss
Put that feel good on my lips, cause

[Chorus]
'Cause you're the one I want
You're the one I need
Baby, if I was a king
Ah, you would be my queen
You're the rock in my roll
You're good for my soul, it's true
I'm head over boots for you

[Bridge]
Yeah, I'm here to pick you up
And I hope I don't let you down, no

[Chorus]
'Cause you're the one I want
You're the one I need
Baby, if I was a king
Ah, you would be my queen
You're the rock in my roll
You're good for my soul, it's true
I'm head over boots for you

[Chorus]
'Cause you're the one I want
You're the one I need
Baby, if I was a king
Ah, you would be my queen
You're the rock in my roll
You're good for my soul, it's true
I'm head over boots for you

[Outro]
I wanna sweep you off your feet tonight
I wanna love you and hold you tight
Spin you around on some old dance floor

[Verse 1]
Yeah, I was just hanging out
Some little west coast town
Found a bar out by the sand
So I made my way in
First thing that caught my eye
Lke nothing I'd ever seen
Sunburned auburn air
The California dream
Yeah, she was shaking them hips
To some old motown song
I couldn't say anything
So I sang along

[Chorus]
She was a heartache on the dance floor
Yeah, she's moving through my mind
I gotta know her name and I gotta see her again
She's got me wondering, yeah I'm just wondering
Where she at, where she at, where she at tonight?
Where she at, where she at, where she at tonight?

[Verse 2]
So I just hung around
This little west coast town
I dropped by every night
I stayed till closing time
My little mystery
That girl is killing me
So I put on a song
Just to sing along

[Chorus]
She was a heartache on the dance floor
Yeah, she's moving through my mind
I gotta know her name and I gotta see her again
She's got me wondering, yeah I'm just wondering
Where she at, where she at, where she at tonight?
Where she at, where she at, where she at tonight?
She's got me mesmerized, she's all I'm thinking about
All I think about, think about, think about

[Bridge]
So I'm right here right now
Humming this little song
If I could say a thing
I'd want you to know

[Chorus]
You were a heartache on the dance floor
Yeah, you're moving through my mind
I gotta know your name and I gotta see you again
And if you're listening, listening, listening
Where you at, where you at, where you at tonight?
Where you at, where you at, where you at tonight?
Girl, I'm hanging around this little town
Where you at, where you at, where you at tonight?
Where you at, where you at, where you at tonight?

[Verse 1]
Appreciate your call
Means a lot and all
Yeah, I got a minute
You and me can talk
About anything you want
As long as she ain't in it

[Verse 2]
Say, it's been at least a month
Since I've had any fun
Buddy, I'll admit it
Yeah, I'm into going out
Think I'm ready for a crowd
As long as she ain't in it

[Chorus]
Don't wanna hear her name
I don't wanna see her face, I swear
I know its gonna hurt
If I run into her somewhere

[Verse 3]
We could hit that place
Down by the interstate
Out past the city limits
Hangout all night long
Hear a country song
As long as she ain't in it

[Chorus]
Don't wanna hear her name
I don't wanna see her face, I swear
I know its gonna hurt
If I run into her somewhere

[Outro]
I can drink and I can dance
I can party, I can laugh
But no matter how you spin it
Everything has changed
My life won't be the same
As long as she ain't in it
As long as she ain't in it, no

[Verse 1]
You're like a highway to a rebel that's ready to run
A no trespass sign on a barbwire jump
That I can't resist, that's just the way it is
You're a don't touch red button I want to push
A bad for me that feels so good
And we both know I can't say no

[Chorus]
Cause a phone call turns into a what's up, what's up
Turns into "baby, can you pick me up?"
Hey, I'm downtown and I don't wanna go home
After two left turns it's you and me alone
Turns into tangled up on my couch with you
Slipping your kisses right across my mouth
And that turns into later on
Later on, lights turned down
Cause I can't turn you down

[Verse 2]
I could say that I ain't picking up next time
I could say I don't want it, but I'd be lying
Cause baby the truth is I want you
And there ain't a damn thing I can do

[Chorus]
A phone call turns into a what's up, what's up
Turns into "baby, can you pick me up?"
Hey, I'm downtown and I don't wanna go home
After two left turns it's you and me alone
Turns into tangled up on my couch with you
Slipping your kisses right across my mouth
And that turns into later on
Later on, lights turned down
Cause I can't turn you down

[Bridge]
You're like my favorite song
I can't turn you off

[Chorus]
A phone call turns into a what's up, what's up
Turns into "baby, can you pick me up?"
Hey, I'm downtown and I don't wanna go home
After two left turns it's you and me alone
Turns into tangled up on my couch with you
Slipping your kisses right across my mouth
And that turns into later on
Later on, lights turned down
Cause I can't turn you down
No, I can't turn you down
Can't turn you down

[Verse 1]
She's got the kind of eyes you wanna get lost in
You're gonna look twice when she gets to walkin'
In a honky tonk with them blue jeans on
She's a cold beer, a whiskey shot, a neon light
A Strait song on the jukebox, a dance all night
What a cowboy wants, a never-do-you-wrong

[Chorus]
Nobody leaves a girl like that
Nobody walks away and never looks back
You'd have to be outta your mind
To tell somethin' that good goodbye
Nobody goes and breaks a heart of gold
Once you get a girl like that, you never let her go
Take it from me, nobody leaves a girl like that

[Verse 2]
I was reckless and wild, didn't think I was ready
Couldn't settle me down, so I fired up my Chevy
I was stubborn and she was cryin'
Well, she knew she couldn't stop me, but she kept right on tryin'

[Chorus]
Nobody leaves a girl like that
Nobody walks away and never looks back
You'd have to be outta your mind
To tell somethin' that good goodbye
Nobody goes and breaks a heart of gold
Once you get a girl like that, you never let her go
Take it from me, nobody leaves a girl like that

[Bridge]
She's the kind of girl that only comes around once
Well, she found somebody new and I'm goin' crazy because

[Chorus]
Nobody leaves a girl like that
Nobody walks away and never looks back
You'd have to be outta your mind
To tell somethin' that good goodbye
Nobody goes and breaks a heart of gold
Once you get a girl like that, you never let her go
Take it from me, nobody leaves
Nobody leaves a girl like that, ah nah
A girl like that

[Verse 1]
She’s a cool breeze in the summer
A hot flame in the winter
The kind of angel that will bring out the devil in you
She’s a gypsy on the move
Never wanna see her go
And I’m right where she left me the first time
With that same no good goodbye
And now I’m

[Chorus]
Sittin’ here wishin’ that I wasn’t missin’
That girl I just can’t tame
A love that just won’t fade
A heart that’s bound to break
Yeah I shoulda known better the moment I let her love me
I fell back in
Now I’m under her spell and over my head again

[Verse 2]
She’s a rollin’ river and I’m her waterfall
I just keep on crashin’ and at the bottom of it all
There’s something holdin’ on, something stayin’ strong
Yeah keepin’ us doin’ what we’ve been doin’ all along
But I’m back to

[Chorus]
Sittin’ here wishin’ that I wasn’t missin’
That girl I just can’t tame
A love that just won’t fade
A heart that’s bound to break
Yeah I shoulda known better the moment I let her love me
I fell back in
Now I’m under her spell and over my head again

[Bridge]
I’ll answer her calls
Yeah anytime, anywhere
Baby you know I’ll be there
Yeah and I’m back to

[Chorus]
Sittin’ here wishin’ that I wasn’t missin’
That girl I just can’t tame
A love that just won’t fade
A heart that’s bound to break
Yeah I shoulda known better the moment I let her love me
I fell back in
Now I’m under her spell and over my head again
Yeah I’m under her spell and over my head again

[Verse 1]
I've been blessed and I have sinned
Wear the scars of where I've been
Lucky to be alive and breathe
In this midnight air
I swear you're right here
Get the chills on my skin
And that's when I get this feeling

[Chorus]
You're shinin' down on me, showing me the way
Angel in the night here to save the day
Like a light out of the dark, straight across the sky
Up there in that starlight, starlight tonight
Yeah, tonight

[Verse 2]
Runnin' down this dream
Up against this road
Sometimes the only thing that I got
Keeps me movin' on
Right where I need to be
No matter where I go
Never too far from home

[Chorus]
Got you shinin' down on me, showing me the way
Angel in the night here to save the day
Like a light out of the dark, straight across the sky
Up there in that starlight, starlight tonight
Oh, tonight

[Bridge]
To the good that die young
Fighters for the freedom fought that keeps me free
And all the heroes in my heart who taught me to believe
And that's why I believe in things I can't see

[Chorus]
Shinin' down on me, showing me the way
Angel in the night here to save the day
Like a light out of the dark, straight across the sky
Up there in that starlight, starlight tonight
Yeah, up there in that starlight, starlight tonight
Yeah, tonight
Shinin' down on me

I was a little outta my mind
Last night when I called you up
I'm sorry if I upset you
With all that missing you stuff

I was just too far gone and all alone
When that phone started calling your name
And I know it's against the rules, girl
But tequila makes me do dumb things

I was just drunk
Dialing your number
Hoping that you just might wanna come over
I might have said a little too much
You know I don't think before I talk
When I got a good buzz
Can't be held responsible for what I was saying
You know I say a lot of things
When I've been drinking
Yeah and I was drinking

Can't believe what I said
But at least I made you laugh
After all this time
Since we said goodbye
I'm glad I can still do that

Girl, I was just drunk
Dialing your number
Hoping that you just might wanna come over
I might have said a little too much
But I don't think before I talk
When I got a good buzz
Can't be held responsible for what I was saying
You know I say a lot of things
When I've been drinking

And I can't guarantee
That there won't be
Another night

When I'll be drunk
Dialing your number
Hoping that you just might wanna come over
I might say a little too much
But I don't think before I talk
When I got a good buzz
Can't be held responsible for what I'll be saying
You know I say a lot of things
When I've been drinking
Oh yeah and I was drinking

[Verse 1]
These days, they call you crazy
If you hold the door for a lady
If you don't call her "girl" 'stead of "baby"
You're out of style, obsolete
If you seal a deal with a handshake
Sit down for a meal and you still pray
If a promise is somethin' you don't break
You're the last of a dyin' breed

[Chorus]
When did old fashioned become so out of fashion?
When did we go out with the old, in with the new?
And you can bet your ass there's a lot of us ol' cats
Wearin' old boots and old hats
That ain't ready to give old hat the boot

[Verse 2]
We ain't afraid to work in the hot sun
We can finish a fight, but won't start one
We don't ever forget where we came from
We've got a degree in the old school
For all that I've learned, I wish that I knew

[Chorus]
When did old fashioned become so out of fashion?
When did we go out with the old, in with the new?
And you can bet your ass there's a lot of us ol' cats
Wearin' old boots and old hats
That ain't ready to give old hat the boot

[Instrumental]

[Chorus]
I say old fashioned don't go out of fashion, no
You don't have to throw all of the old out for the new
And you can bet your ass there's a lot of us ol' cats
Wearin' old boots and old hats
That ain't ready to give old hat the boot
Yeah, there's a lot of us old hats
That ain't ready to give old hat the boot

[Verse 1]
We've been out all night
Tearing up this town
It's time to bring it all home
Start the second round
Cause when you get turned on
I can't turn you down
You stop to slip it off, grab my hand

[Chorus]
And start dancing around the bedroom
Moonlight through the window
Country on the radio, silhouette, beautiful
Come a little closer, give me some of that
Baby, you look so good
In nothing but my cowboy hat
Nothing but my cowboy hat

[Verse 2]
We should've just stayed in
Left that truck in the drive
The way you're looking now
Gonna be up all night
Love how you throw it down
Over those angel eyes
Baby, keep on driving me wild

[Chorus]
And start dancing around the bedroom
Moonlight through the window
Country on the radio, silhouette, beautiful
Come a little closer, give me some of that
Baby, you look so good
In nothing but my cowboy hat, yeah

[Bridge]
Can't resist you in that Resistol
That's one thing you don't have to take off

[Chorus]
When you're dancing around the bedroom
Moonlight through the window
Country on the radio, silhouette, beautiful
Come a little closer, give me some of that
Baby, you look so good
In nothing but my cowboy hat
Nothing but my cowboy hat

[Outro]
So, come a little closer, give me some of that
You look so good in nothing but my cowboy hat
Nothing but my cowboy hat, yeah
Keep on dancin'

[Verse 1: Jon Pardi]
We can fight the fight all damn night
But in the morning light, the lies reveal the truth
Yeah, the sober truth
We wake up to reality
And play the blame game ruthlessly
Like it woulda turned out different
If we woulda stopped at one or two

[Chorus: Jon Pardi & Lauren Alaina]
But don't blame it on whiskey
No, this ain't about a drink
Don't let alcohol take the fall
For all these thoughts I think
Let's get down to the bottom
And not just the bottom of the glass
This heartbreak train's pickin' up steam
And we're standin' on the track
Yeah, I can blame it on you
Or you can blame it on me
But don't blame it on whiskey

[Verse 2: Lauren Alaina, Jon Pardi & Lauren Alaina]
So here we are, and there it is
This line we're leaning up against
Wonderin' which way we're gonna fall
And how we're gonna answer that last call

[Chorus: Jon Pardi & Lauren Alaina]
But don't blame it on whiskey
No, this ain't about a drink
Don't let alcohol take the fall
For all these thoughts I think
Let's get down to the bottom
And not just the bottom of the glass
This heartbreak train's pickin' up steam
And we're standin' on the track
Yeah, I can blame it on you
Or you can blame it on me
But don't blame it on–

[Bridge: Jon Pardi & Lauren Alaina]
Whiskey might be strong
But it ain't got nothin' on what's goin' on here

[Chorus: Jon Pardi & Lauren Alaina, Jon Pardi & Lauren Alaina]
Let's get down to the bottom
And not just the bottom of the glass
This heartbreak train is pickin' up steam
And we're standin' on the track
Yeah, I can blame it on me (I can blame it on me)
Or you can blame it on me (Or you can blame it on me)
But don't blame it on whiskey
Yeah, I can blame it on me
You can blame it on me
But don't blame it on whiskey

[Verse 1]
Things been goin' pretty damn good
Hell of a lot better than I thought they would
When her last goodbye came on back
I swore then it'd be the last time I ever let her down
'Cause what I didn't know then I sure know now

[Chorus]
I'm gonna love her like she's leaving
Like she's packed up her heart
Like there's no tomorrow
So she don't get too far
I won't give her one good reason
I'll be the me that she believes in
I'm gonna love her
I'm gonna love her like she's leaving

[Verse 2]
An empty bottle and an empty bed
Missing her memories poundin' my head
The thought of her with someone else
How could I do that to myself?
Watchin' her walk out that front door
Is somethin' I don't wanna see no more

[Chorus]
Yeah, I'm gonna love her like she's leaving
Like she's packed up her heart
Like there's no tomorrow
So she don't get too far
I won't give her one good reason
I'll be the me that she believes in
I'm gonna love her
I'm gonna love her like she's leaving, oh
I'm gonna love her
I'm gonna love her like she's leaving

[Outro]
Things been goin' pretty damn good
Hell of a lot better than I thought they would

[Verse 1]
She left about three weeks ago
A single man is a new thing
But I've been here before
And I've been drinking, I've been smoking
I've been looking around
I need a stranger to break some new ground

[Chorus]
And maybe I'll get lucky tonight
Find me a girl, take my heartache away
Set sail blues
I'll see you another day, wouldn't that be so fine?
Maybe I'll get lucky tonight

[Verse 2]
I dance on to the song
A melody pulling at my heartstrings
Bout a love gone wrong
And I've been doing everything I can
Trying to move on

[Chorus]
And maybe I'll get lucky tonight
Find me a girl, take my heartache away
Set sail, blues
I'll see you another day, wouldn't that be so fine?
Maybe I'll get lucky tonight

[Bridge]
Fade away with the party lights
Whiskey on ice makes you feel real nice
It's how you doin?
Girl, how you been baby?
Maybe I'll get lucky tonight

[Chorus]
And maybe I'll get lucky tonight
Find me a girl, take my heartache away
Set sail, blues
I'll see you another day, wouldn't that be so fine?
Maybe I'll get lucky tonight
Take me, take me, take me away
Take me, take me, take me away
Wouldn't that be so fine?

[Verse 1]
Her hands wrapped up in mine
Tears rollin' out of her eyes
No messin' with a made-up mind
Sun settin' on goodbye
Yeah, it's hard to believe
It wasn't me tryin' to leave this time

[Chorus]
It ain't always the cowboy
That ain't got a lot of hang around
Ain't got no settle down in their boots
Gone's just what they do
That restless running, searchin' for something
Leavin' love in the dust of a midnight Chevrolet
It ain't always the cowboy that rides away

[Verse 2]
I've never seen over from this side
Never heard lonely get this quiet
Still, I can't keep from smiling
'Cause, damn, that girl can fly

[Chorus]
It ain't always the cowboy
That ain't got a lot of hang around
Ain't got no settle down in their boots
Gone's just what they do
That restless running, searchin' for something
Leavin' love in the dust of a midnight Chevrolet
It ain't always the cowboy that rides away

[Bridge]
A tumbleweed heart chasin' that wind
Goin' too far, wherever that is

[Chorus]
It ain't always the cowboy
That ain't got a lot of hang around
Ain't got no settle down in their boots
Gone's just what they do
That restless running, searchin' for something
Leavin' love in the dust of a midnight Chevrolet
It ain't always the cowboy that rides away
Rides away
It ain't always the cowboy

[Verse 1]
When I first got to Nashville town
They called me in and sat me down
And told me all about the ins and outs of writing songs
Said write about the things you know about
If there's anything that you don't know about
Just stick around and you'll find out before too long

[Verse 2]
So I pulled out my guitar and I put my pen to paper
Started working on the groove
They could move to all night long
Yeah, I poured out my heart soul
Strummed a chord, next thing you know
I looked down and I had this song

[Chorus]
And it goes
Jesus saves and beers better cold
A good woman's made to love not just to hold
Monday through Friday sure takes awhile
We all get sideways and go that extra mile
The common ways we work and play
Are still alive and well today
Don't need to find a new way to say
We don't go out of style

[Verse 2]
It may never see a bullet
In a billboard magazine
But then I've never been the kind
To go out chasing smoking guns
All I know is all of us tonight
Know all the words and we're acting like
It'll be a week before the weekend's done

[Chorus]
Singing, Jesus saves and beers better cold
A good woman's made to love not just to hold
Monday through Friday sure takes awhile
We all get sideways and go that extra mile
The common ways we work and play
Are still alive and well today
Don't need to find a new way to say
We don't go out of style

[Chorus]
Singing, Jesus saves and beers better cold
A good woman's made to love not just to hold
Monday through Friday sure takes awhile
We all get sideways and go that extra mile
The common ways we work and play
Are still alive and well today
Don't need to find a new way to say
We don't go out of style

[Spoken Outro]
Ain't going out of style
Yeah, no
Get me one of those cold beers

[Verse 1]
I'm a ghost on the radio
A needle on the vinyl
A country boy survival
The bottom of a bottle, yeah
I’m the fightin' side of you and me
And my heart's down in Tennessee

[Chorus]
And I sing songs about freight trains and prisons
Heartaches and honky-tonks
Cowboys and outlaws
Good-hearted women
In boots and straw hats
All gone, just like that
They can’t even recognize me
They used to call me Country

[Verse 2]
Used to have cool names like Willie and Waylon
Merle and Hank
We all stood together
We sang and we drank
Chased the white lines
Night after night

[Chorus]
Singin' songs about freight trains and prisons
Heartaches and honky-tonks
And cowboys and outlaws
Good-hearted women
In boots and straw hats
All gone, just like that
They can't even recognize me
They used to call me Country

[Verse 3]
Like an old violin
Put away and never played again
Paycheck and Cash
Naw, they ain't comin' back

[Chorus]
They did songs about freight trains and prisons
Heartaches and honky-tonks
Cowboys and outlaws
Good-hearted women
In boots and straw hats
All gone, just like that
They can't even recognize me
They used to call me Country

[Outro]
They used to call me Country
I'm a thing of the past
I'm a ghost on the radio

[Verse 1]
You could hear the wind howling across the ocean
And the taste of the wine and the buzzed feel in my head
And the only wifi was burning right beside me
And we had us a night I'll never forget
She was a 1960's Beach Boys song
And we're living that dream all night long

[Chorus]
In that California sunrise
In that California sunrise
She took me to heaven and so much more
Like nothing I've ever seen before
In that California sunrise

[Verse 2]
Pretty soon it was raining up in Seattle
And it sure was cold out in Colorado
Yeah, I was missing her kiss in the heat of Arizona
Been everywhere and nothing could compare
Yeah, to that one of a kind trip I was on
Everything about her felt like home

[Chorus]
In that California sunrise
In that California sunrise
She took me to heaven and so much more
Like nothing I've ever seen before
In that California sunrise
Take me on back

[Bridge]
Found her number in a pocket of my blue jeans
Picked up the phone and let it ring
Said "I'm counting down the miles back to you, babe"
Yeah, I'm heading west on a big old jet plane

[Chorus]
Back to that California sunrise
That California sunrise
She took me to heaven and so much more
Like nothing I've ever seen before
In that California sunrise
Take me on back
That California sunrise
That California sunrise
That California sunrise
That California sunrise
Take me on back

[Verse 1]
Pardon me, I don't mean to pry
I saw the tears falling from your eyes, and I thought
You're too pretty not to wear a smile
Hope you don't mind if I sit down for awhile

[Chorus]
'Cause I want tequila little time with you
A little salt and a lime will do
Hey bar man, will you bring us two?
I want tequila little time with you
Talkin' it all out
Seein' what you're all about
I hope you're wantin' tequila little time with me too

[Verse 2]
We don't have to talk about the past
Here's to moving forward and not looking back
Little later, we can take it to the dance floor
But until then, let's order a couple more

[Chorus]
'Cause I want tequila little time with you
A little salt and a lime will do
Hey bar man, will you bring us two?
I want tequila little time with you
Talkin' it all out
Seein' what you're all about
I hope you're wantin' tequila little time with me too

[Bridge]
It's good to see you laughin'
I guess this had to happen
Now let's just get to dancin'

[Chorus]
'Cause I want tequila little time with you
A little salt and a lime will do
Hey bar man, will you bring us two?
I want tequila little time with you
Talkin' it all out
Seein' what you're all about
I hope you're wantin' tequila little time with me too

[Outro]
Hope you're wantin' tequila little time with me too
Hope you're wantin' tequila little time with me too, oh

[Verse 1]
Yeah, you're my midnight trip ride
Yeah, you're stronger than moonshine
My backwoods, homegrown baby, you're so fine
Girl, I wanna roll you up and smoke ya'
So addicted every time I get to hold ya'
You're my dealer and I'm your love junkie
I don't care, I'll spend all my money

[Chorus]
Oh, cause baby you're my all time high
Fly me right up into the sky
I'm your rocket man
And I don't wanna ever come down
Oh, you taste like heaven
You turn my knob right to eleven
Oh, you make me feel so right
Cause baby you're my all time high

[Verse 2]
Yeah, just one kiss from you
Is just enough to make me come unglued
You got some powerful stuff
And I just can't get enough

[Chorus]
Oh, cause baby you're my all time high
Fly me right up into the sky
I'm your rocket man
And I don't wanna ever come down
Oh, you taste like heaven
You turn my knob right to eleven
Oh, you make me feel so right
Cause baby you're my all time high

[Bridge]
Oh, baby you'll always be
Oh, the only drug I need

[Chorus]
Oh, cause baby you're my all time high
Fly me right up into the sky
I'm your rocket man
And I don't wanna ever come down
Oh, you taste like heaven
You turn my knob right to eleven
Oh, you make me feel so right
The day I quit you is the day I die
Cause baby you're my all time high
Yeah, baby you're my all time high
And I don't ever wanna come down

[Verse 1]
Back when I was just 18, I met the man in black
He said "Jon, it's nice to meet you, my name is Jack"
We hung out all the time, we became good friends
We ran around, we hit the town every damn weekend
I started missin' work 'cause I was dog-tired
That boss man had enough and good ol' Jack got me fired

[Chorus]
Me and Jack don't get along no more
He's high up on the shelf while I'm lyin' on the floor
He makes me do things I've never done before
He makes me cuss, he makes me fight
Don't know what I did last night
Should've left his ass at the liquor store
Naw, me and Jack don't get along no more

[Verse 2]
Saw the girl of my dreams and, man, she made me nervous
So, I leaned on my buddy Jack 'cause he gave me the courage
I swept her off her feet, stole her heart and made her mine
She moved in and didn't like my friend Jack takin' all our time
She started gettin' jealous, said, "Jack's got to go"
He just wouldn't leave, so my girl hit the road, and

[Chorus]
Me and Jack don't get along no more
He's high up on the shelf while I'm lyin' on the floor
He makes me do things I've never done before
He makes me cuss, he makes me fight
Don't know what I did last night
Should've left his ass at the liquor store
Naw, me and Jack don't get along no more
Ah naw

[Bridge]
Well, Jack got me in a trouble and I wound up in jail
So, I'm here doin' time 'cause he won't pay my bail
I'm gonna change my ways as soon as I get out
I'm headed for that liquor store to buy a fifth of Crown, 'cause

[Chorus]
Me and Jack don't get along no more
He's high up on the shelf while I'm lyin' on the floor
He makes me do things I've never done before
He makes me cuss, he makes me fightP Don't know what I did last night
Should've left his ass at the liquor store
Naw, me and Jack don't get along no more

[Outro]
Naw, me and Jack don't get along no more
Naw, we don't

[Verse 1]
No, I didn't expect to see you in here tonight
But I'm having a good time catching up with you
Yeah, with our history, you know it should be no surprise
I see you and then fall again

[Chorus]
Just like old times
Spendin' the night wrapped up tight
Dancin' 'round the room
Lost in each other like old times
Let's see where it goes
And who knows, we might start something new

[Verse 2]
No need to talk about where we left off
It is what it is, we did what we did, and here we are
Yeah, what we're feeling now, let's not think about if it's right or wrong
Gettin' closer, your head on my shoulder

[Chorus]
Just like old times
Spendin' the night wrapped up tight
Dancin' 'round the room
Lost in each other like old times
Let's see where it goes
And who knows, we might start something new, yeah

[Bridge]
And the band don't quit 'til midnight
And until then, hold me like

[Chorus]
Old times
Spendin' the night wrapped up tight
Dancin' 'round the room
Lost in each other like old times
Let's see where it goes
And who knows, we might start something new
Let's see where it goes
And who knows, we might start something new, yeah

[Verse 1]
It sure is pourin’ down tonight
It hasn’t stopped since nine
And it’s poundin’ on the roof
Where under it I used to sleep with you
So good but not this time
We’ve gone so far apart since goodbye
And I couldn’t feel more alone tonight
And you’re the only thing that’s on my mind

[Chorus]
And the thunder cries
And lightnin’ strikes
That’s when I would hold you tight
And say everything’s gonna be alright
Everything’s gonna be alright
I’d make you laugh to see you smile
I’d get real close and whisper goodnight
And I’m layin’ down thinkin’ ‘bout
All the things we could do
‘Cause this rainy night’s no fun
Without you

[Verse 2]
Yeah I should be cleanin’ my closet
Fixin’ that drippin’ water faucet
Anything to keep my mind from runnin’ back to you
Instead I’m lookin’ up at the ceilin’
With that same old missing you feelin’
Wonderin’ if you’re thinkin’ the same thing too

[Chorus]
And the thunder cries
And lightnin’ strikes
That’s when I would hold you tight
And say everything’s gonna be alright
Everything’s gonna be alright
I’d make you laugh to see you smile
I’d get real close and whisper goodnight
And I’m layin’ down thinkin’ ‘bout
All the things we could do
‘Cause this rainy night’s no fun
Without you

[Bridge]
Yeah I know we had to end it baby
We’re pretty good at drivin’ each other crazy
But I will always love you

[Chorus]
And as the thunder cries
And lightnin’ strikes
That’s when I would hold you tight
And say everything’s gonna be alright
Everything’s gonna be alright
I’d make you laugh to see you smile
I’d get real close and whisper goodnight
And I’m layin’ down thinkin’ ‘bout
All the things we could do
‘Cause this rainy night’s no fun
Without you
Just ain’t no fun without you

[Verse 1]
She said, "I'm tired of those boots being dirty all the time
All your huntin’ stuff and your three-day scruff you know I don't like"
And then she started on all my friends and all my drinkin'
Well, speaking of my friends and speaking of my drinkin’
(One, two, three, four)

[Chorus]
I cut her loose and tied one on
Closed down my favorite honky tonk
Don't know why I waited so damn long
I cut her loose and tied one on

[Verse 2]
Yeah, I was drinking like George Jones, dancing like Elvis
Told my friends what happened and they all said, "Hell yeah"
A lotta high-fives and a lotta beer went down
Ask me where she is now, I don't give a damn now
(One, two, three, four)

[Chorus]
I cut her loose and tied one on
Closed down my favorite honky tonk
Don't know why I waited so damn long
I cut her loose and tied one on

[Verse 3]
Saw a blonde at the jukebox, punchin' up some Haggard
Used to be tied down, now it doesn't matter
We were spinnin' and a-twirlin', all up in them curves when
She said, "Wait, do you have a girlfriend?"
Nope

[Chorus]
I cut her loose and tied one on
Closed down my favorite honky tonk
Don’t know why I waited so damn long
I cut her loose and tied one on
I cut her loose and tied one on
Closed down my favorite honky tonk
Don’t know why I waited so damn long
I cut her loose and tied one on, yeah

Waitin’ at a stop sign, a school bus passes by
Yeah that wasn’t long ago, that was me hitchin’ a ride
And I lost track of many yesterdays, the way it felt to be that age
The people, the faces, they all change
Ain’t it funny how it slips away

Yeah we’re all down here just a livin’ on borrowed time
Can’t push a button and just hit rewind
From the day we’re born ‘til the day that sun don’t shine
Yeah we’re all down here just livin’ on borrowed time

I don’t wanna live life with regrets
Yeah there’ll be mistakes I haven’t made yet
And if you don’t climb then you can’t fall
And money sure don’t buy it all
And the only thing I know
Is you can’t take it with you when you go

Yeah we’re all down here just a livin’ on borrowed time
Can’t push a button and just hit rewind
From the day we’re born ‘til the day that sun don’t shine
Yeah we’re all down here just livin’ on borrowed time

So just keep livin’ it up
Cause there’s never enough
Of livin’ and learnin’ and lovin’

Yeah we’re all down here just a livin’ on borrowed time
Can’t push a button and just hit rewind
From the day we’re born ‘til we’re standin’ in the judgment line
Yeah we’re all down here just livin’ on borrowed time
Yeah we’re all down here just livin’ on borrowed time

[Verse 1]
I'm gonna spend, yeah
Cause I earned it, yeah
Forty hour week, ten hours overtime
Sitting in traffic, working all the time
Gonna drink it, yeah
I'll make it worth it, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
Straight from the bank to the honky-tonk
Burning a hole

[Chorus]
Paycheck, won't you take my blues away?
Paycheck, won't you take my blues away?
Yeah, I've been waiting on you since Monday
And it's work, work, work
And I need a break
Won't you take my blues away?

[Verse 2]
I got cash, yeah
Should I save it? No
Cause I'm buying rams like I'm crazy
Two for one for the ladies
Cause they're fine, yeah
We'll be going all night

[Pre-Chorus]
Straight from the bank to the honky-tonk
Burning a hole

[Chorus]
Paycheck, won't you take my blues away?
Paycheck, won't you take my blues away?
Yeah, I've been waiting on you since Monday
And it's work, work, work
And I need a break
Won't you take my blues away?

[Bridge]
So drink it, yeah
And spend it, yeah
Cause we're climbing that ladder
Punching that clock
So raise them up

[Chorus]
Paycheck, won't you take my blues away?
Paycheck, won't you take my blues away?
Yeah, I've been waiting on you since Monday
And it's work, work, work
And I need a break
Won't you take my blues away?
Paycheck, won't you take my blues away?
Paycheck, won't you take my blues away?
Yeah, I've been waiting on you since Monday
And it's work, work, work
And I need a break
Won't you take my blues away?

[Verse]
Yeah girl, I just had me
One hell of a work week
It's been driving me crazy
Not enough of you baby
Yeah, and I been a-thinking
'Bout breaking in the weekend
Not doing any sleeping
So get in, let's take a ride

[Chorus]
And baby let's go, take a dirt road
Kick it back, find a good song on the radio
'Til we get lost in a sunset falling
Lay a blanket by the creek
Where the moon peeks over that sycamore tree
And there won't be anyone watching
No one watching
Now there ain't nothing wrong, baby, you and I
Getting down to some up all night

[Verse 2]
Now don't forget your flip-flops
We can stop by the quick stop
Get some jerky and a twelve pack
No telling when we'll be back
I got a cooler in the truck bed
A couple towels when we get wet
Cause you know we're gonna jump in
And take a little midnight swim

[Chorus 2]
So baby let's go, take a dirt road
Kick it back, find a good song on the radio
'Til we get lost in a sunset falling
Lay a blanket by the creek
Where the moon peeks over that sycamore tree
And there won't be anyone watching
No one watching
Now there ain't nothing wrong, baby, you and I
Getting down to some up all night

[Bridge]
Come Monday, I'll be back to working and saving
But until then, yeah

[Verse 3]
Baby let's go, take a dirt road
Kick it back, find a good song on the radio
'Til we get lost in a sunset falling
Lay a blanket by the creek
Where the moon peeks over that sycamore tree
And there won't be anyone watching
No one watching
Now there ain't nothing wrong, baby, you and I
Getting down to some up all night

Yeah, me and you, oh
Up all night, yeah

[Verse 1]
I know that all we've ever known
Is how to be the best of friends
And hanging out and cutting up
Ain't as easy as it's been
You know I've always loved you girl
Aw, but never quite like this
Been waiting so long to right what's wrong
And taste your kiss

[Chorus]
And when you wanna be wanted
And you need to be needed
When you wanna move on
Cause you want somebody
Who's nothing like he is
You know I've always been waiting
And I guess what I'm saying
Is I am that man

[Verse 2]
You know it's killing me inside
Watching you go through
The truth of all his lies
Girl, I think it's time you knew
That I'm here to pick you up
And I won't let you down
Girl, whenever you're ready
I'll still be hanging around

[Chorus]
And when you wanna be wanted
And you need to be needed
When you wanna move on
Cause you want somebody
Who's nothing like he is
You know I've always been waiting
And I guess what I'm saying
Is I am that man

And when you wanna be wanted
And you need to be needed
When you wanna move on
Cause you want somebody
Who's nothing like he is
You know I've always been waiting
And I guess what I'm saying
Is I am that man

I am
Whoa, oh, I am that man

[Verse 1]
If he's got a dusty old cowboy hat
If he won a buckle ridin’ on a bull's back
If he's broken bones you didn’t know you had
Buy that man a beer

[Verse 2]
If he left home when he turned eighteen
If he earned his stripes when he stormed a beach
If he can't forget about the things he's seen
Buy that man a beer

[Chorus]
Order up an ice-cold longneck, slide it on down
Oughta be a line out the door to buy him a round
Pull up a stool and lend him an ear
Hear a story that'll bring you to tears
Buy that man a beer

[Verse 3]
If he plays guitar every Saturday night
If there's a song that's about a goodbye
He's learned every lick and lived every line
Buy that man a beer

[Chorus]
Order up an ice-cold longneck, slide it on down
Oughta be a line out the door to buy him a round
Pull up a stool and lend him an ear
Hear a story that'll bring you to tears
Buy that man a beer

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
Order up an ice-cold longneck, slide it on down
Oughta be a line out the door to buy him a round
If you ever get the chance
To belly-up with someone like that
Order up an ice-cold longneck, slide it on down
Oughta be a line out the door to buy him a round
Pull up a stool and lend him an ear
Hear a story that’ll bring you to tears
Buy that man a beer
Yeah, buy that man a beer

[Verse 1]
I knew the first time should've been the last time
I ever let the whiskey touch my lips
Cause the devil wears black and he goes by Jack
And he's really good at helpin' me forget

I thought it was cool when I was a kid
Walkin' around with that cigarette lit
On that ol' dirt road, I lit my first smoke
And I knew right then it wouldn't let me go

[Chorus]
And it's all or nothing
So keep it coming
Let that feeling run through my veins
Ain't no stopping, keep on rocking, yeah
It seems I'm always
Yeah, I'm always
Picking up what I can't put down
Yeah, I'm always
Picking up what I can't put, can't put, can't put down

[Verse 2]
She looked my way then looked back again
Gotta different kinda high when I touched her skin
When she laid it on me, she rocked my world
I knew I'd never get away from that girl

[Chorus]
And it's all or nothing
So keep it coming
Let that feeling run through my veins
Ain't no stopping, keep on rocking, yeah
It seems I'm always
Yeah, I'm always
Picking up what I can't put down
Yeah, I'm always
Picking up what I can't put, can't put, can't put down

[Verse 3]
When I walked into my first smoky bar
Cranked up the amp and played this guitar
Had 'em singing along by the end of the night
And I knew I finally got one thing right

[Chorus]
And it's all or nothing
So keep it coming
Let that feeling run through my veins
Ain't no stopping, keep on rocking, yeah
It seems I'm always
Yeah, I'm always
Picking up what I can't put down
Yeah, I'm always
Picking up what I can't put down
Yeah, I'm always
Picking up what I can't put, can't put, can't put down
Yeah, yeah, I wanna put it down

[Verse 1]
Anybody else find themselves
In a 'shoulda done this, shoulda done that'?
Try to do the best you can
'Cause you wanna be good but you love to be bad
Your stress relief comes with the need
To kick the work week's ass
If you're feelin' this then catch a buzz
And go on and raise your glass

[Chorus]
There's always one more beer you gotta drink
One more girl you gotta meet
One more song on the jukebox
Spendin' my money like it don't stop
Could blame it all on my roots
My honky-tonk attitude
I'm feelin' this temptation in my current situation
But morning's gonna come, gonna be early
Gotta go to work, gonna get dirty
Shoulda stayed in, instead I went out
But I oughta know that by now

[Verse 2]
Had me a girl but it went south
Whatever was workin' didn't work out
It could've been my ramblin' ways
My rowdy friends, hell, I can't say
Ain't got time for slowing down
I'm shiftin' gears and headin' out
A good time's callin' my name
So just get outta my way, yeah

[Chorus]
One more beer you gotta drink
One more girl you gotta meet
One more song on the jukebox
Spendin' my money like it don't stop
Could blame it all on my roots
My honky-tonk attitude
I'm feelin' this temptation in my current situation
But morning's gonna come, gonna be early
Gotta go to work, gonna get dirty
Shoulda stayed in, instead I went out
But I oughta know that by now

[Bridge]
Some day I'm gonna learn
But it ain't gonna be tonight, uh

[Chorus]
One more beer you gotta drink
One more girl you gotta meet
One more song on the jukebox
Spendin' my money like it don't stop
Could blame it all on my roots
My honky-tonk attitude
I'm feelin' this temptation in my current situation
But morning's gonna come, gonna be early
Gotta go to work, gonna get dirty
Shoulda stayed in, instead I went out
But I oughta know that by now

[Outro]
I oughta know that by now, yeah
Woo!

[Verse 1]
Well I’m sick of all these city lights
Paying too much money for a good time
Rather call some friends of mine
Say there’s a place that ain’t hard to find
It’s just two lefts and one right
A beat up barn on the county line
Ain’t too far for a truck or car
Yeah I know a place we can go

[Chorus]
On the backroads
And we can crank up that radio
Just bring an ice chest full of beer
Ain’t nothin’ but hay fields out here
And everything’s gonna be all right
The dance floor’s made of dirt tonight
On the backroads
Yeah back on the backroads

[Verse 2]
When you get close, you better drive slow
Cause this old road’s full of potholes
Just flip your brights a couple times
So we all know you ain’t the PoPo
Yeah we’re all here on country time
Tearin’ it up under cargo lights
We might stay here all night
Wake up to that morning sunrise

[Chorus]
On the backroads
And we can crank up that radio
Just bring an ice chest full of beer
Ain’t nothin’ but hay fields out here
And everything’s gonna be all right
The dance floor’s made of dirt tonight
On the backroads
Yeah back on the backroads

[Outro]
Yeah back on the backroads
We can crank up that radio
Yeah just bring your beer or alcohol
Hell you can even bring your dog
If you get lost, just give me a call
We’re tearin’ it up all night long
On the backroads
Yeah back on the backroads
Aw yeah

Does anybody wanna go out drinkin’ with me
I’ve been workin’ like a dog and lord knows it’s been a long ass week
I might blow my top if I can’t go blow off some steam
Does anybody wanna go, go, go, go, go, go drinkin’ with me

Does anybody wanna go tear up this town
Yeah why stay home and be all alone when she ain’t around
I’m gonna raise my glass until I can’t, I’m finally free
Does anybody wanna go, go, go, go, go, go drinkin’ with me

Come by and pick me up
No I ain’t gonna drive my truck
But man you’re in luck, the first rounds on me

Does anybody wanna make some history
Leave a trail of broken hearts, empty bottles and debauchery
Don’t know about you but I sure could use some company
Does anybody wanna go, go, go, go, go, go drinkin’ with me

Start that open tab
Slap me on the back
Yeah one more shot boys
The third rounds on me
The fourth rounds on me
The fifth rounds on me

Does anybody wanna go out drinkin’ with me
I’ve been workin’ like a dog and lord knows it’s been a long ass week
I might blow my top if I can’t go blow off some steam
Does anybody wanna go, go, go, go, go, go drinkin’ with me
Does anybody wanna go, go, go, go, go, go drinkin’ with me
Does anybody wanna go drinkin’ with me

How 'bout tonight we just go crazy
Shoot out the lights then who knows maybe
We'll dance in the dark
And won't come apart 'til morning
Sneaks in to find us then we'll start over
The day won't unwind us, we'll just get closer
I know you don't know me but I got this feeling

I've been looking at your smile all night
And if the things you got me thinking work out right
We just might fall in love
I hear it happens all the time

Let's make us some memories worth saving
Have us some fun misbehaving
I already see just how good it's gonna be if we just
Give in and let go and see what happens
I know we're so close to almost having
Something reckless, something real, that's how you make me feel

Yeah, I've been looking at your smile all night
And if the things you got me thinking work out right
We just might fall in love
I hear it happens all the time

Yeah, I've been looking at your smile all night
And if the things you got me thinking work out right
We just might fall in love
I hear it happens all the time

So, don't say, yes, but darling don't say, no
Let's start with a kiss and see where it goes
It just might last forever
I hear it happens all the time

[Verse 1]
Been running this highway like a greyhound
Ain't nothing left for me to see
And sometimes I just wish that I could break down
And get on back to you and me
Take the next flight and leave this crazy life
Get back home in time to kiss you goodnight

[Chorus]
And whoa oh oh, lately all I think about
Whoa oh oh, is what we could be doing now
Whoa oh oh, baby
Here I go again
Missing you crazy, yeah
[Instrumental]
[Verse 2]
Sitting here listening to your sweet voice
Talking on the telephone
It's making me realize, I ain't got no choice
Between staying here and getting gone
I'm gonna say good-bye
Yeah I'm gonna fly
Get these arms of mine back where they belong

[Chorus]
Whoa oh oh, lately all I think about
Whoa oh oh, is what we could be doing now
Whoa oh oh, baby
Here I go again
Missing you crazy, yeah

[Outro]
And whoa oh oh, lately all I think about
Whoa oh oh, is what we could be doing now
Whoa oh oh, baby, here I go again
Whoa oh oh, baby, here I go again
Missing you crazy, yeah yeah
Missing you crazy, mmmm

[Verse 1]
I’ve been down to the bottom of a bottle
I’ve lived my life stuck in full throttle
And slowin’ down, slowin’ down keeps grindin’ my gears
And I took risks I never shoulda taken
I broke hearts that didn’t need breakin’
And I don’t know why, don’t know why I can’t cry tears

[Chorus]
And I just can’t seem to walk the line
It’s always been easy to say goodbye
When I’m always runnin’
Ain’t nothin’ gonna change my mind
And I just can’t seem to get a clue
I never seem to think things through
It’s T-U-F-F tuff, I can’t win the fight
With the fool inside of me

[Verse 2]
Too many times I’ve had to learn the hard way
Made mistakes but tomorrow’s a new day
I’ve been there, done that, I ain’t lookin’ back
Yeah and I lost track with man in the mirror
But a whiskey glass seemed to make things clearer
And I don’t know why, don’t know why but I’ve got it bad

[Chorus]
And I just can’t seem to walk the line
It’s always been easy to say goodbye
When I’m always runnin’
Ain’t nothin’ gonna change my mind
And I just can’t seem to get a clue
I never seem to think things through
It’s t-u-f-f tuff, I can’t win the fight
With the fool inside of me

[Bridge]
And when I’m about to get things straight
The fool in me takes a swing
He always seems to find a way to
Turn me upside down…yeah yeah

[Chorus]
And I just can’t seem to walk the line
It’s always been easy to say goodbye
When I’m always runnin’
Ain’t nothin’ gonna change my mind
And I just can’t seem to get a clue
I never seem to think things through
It’s t-u-f-f tuff, I can’t win the fight
With the fool inside of me
Yeah fightin’ the fool
Fightin’ the fool inside of me

[Verse 1]
Girl, I'm gonna warn ya, I'm leaving California
First thing in the morning
Me and the band are loading up the van
We gotta go, we got another show
We're headed out to Reno, Jackson Hole
After that, I don't really know
But if you're looking for a good time
We can make us a memory of Bakersfield tonight

[Chorus]
And then I'll write you a song
You might hear it on the radio
Baby, you never know
But it's gonna be just about you and me
How much I miss you
You're the one that got away
You're gonna hear your song someday

[Verse 2]
Now I'm talking to the sweet thing
Backstage in Tennessee
She says she wants to take me home
Show me a couple things I didn't know
Come on, let's go
But I gotta hit the road in the morning
I'm headed down to San Anton'
Long as we're back by sunrise
We can make us a memory of Nashville tonight

[Chorus]
And then I'll write you a song
You might hear it on the radio
Baby, you never know
But it's gonna be just about you and me
How much I miss you
You're the one that got away
You're gonna hear your song someday

[Bridge]
And I swear I'm not a bad guy
I just don't got a whole lot of time
It always ends with the same goodbye

[Chorus]
But I'll write you a song
You might hear it on the radio
Baby, you never know
But it's gonna be just about you and me
How much I miss you
You're the one that got away
You're gonna hear your song someday
Yeah, you're gonna hear your song someday
When I write you a song, yeah
Baby, when I write you a song
Yeah, I'm gonna write you
Yeah, I'm gonna write you a song girl

Somebody get me a guitar

You packed your clothes and all your stuff
'Til there was nothing left of us
Guess what we had ain't enough
That map beside you on the seat
Is riding right where I wanna be
Wish I could stop your leaving me

But no matter how far you go
My love is strong, won't lose a hold
Just cause you're gone won't mean we've disappeared
I can still love you from here

It's your decision, it's not mine
You're the one who drew this line
I know I can't change your mind
You might wind up in Santa Fe
Santa Cruz or in L.A
Across the ocean, and that's okay

Just know that, no matter how far you go
My love is strong, won't lose a hold
Just cause you're gone won't mean we've disappeared
I can still love you from here

If you leave now, you'll just ride into the sun
So, why don't you wait 'til morning comes?

Just know that, no matter how far you go
My love is strong, won't lose a hold
Just cause you're gone won't mean we've disappeared
I can still love you
I can still love you from here

[Intro]
I got my toes in the water, ass in the sand
Not a worry in the world, a cold beer in my hand
Life is good today, life is good today

[Verse 1]
Well, the plane touched down just about three o'clock
And the city's still on my mind
Bikinis and palm trees danced in my head
I was still in the baggage line
Concrete and cars are their own prison bars
Like this life I'm living in
But the plane brought me farther, I'm surrounded by water
And I'm not going back again

[Pre-Chorus]
I got my toes in the water, ass in the sand
Not a worry in the world, a cold beer in my hand
Life is good today, life is good today

[Chorus 1]
Adios and vaya con Dios
Yeah, I'm leaving GA
And if it weren't for tequila and pretty señoritas
I'd have no reason to stay
Adios and vaya con Dios
Yeah, I'm leaving GA
Going to lay in the hot sun and roll a big fat one
And grab my guitar and play

[Verse 2]
Four days flew by like a drunk Friday night
As the summer drew to an end
They can't believe that I just couldn't leave
And I bid adieu to my friends
Cause my bartender, she's from the islands
Her body's been kissed by the sun
And coconut replaces the smell of the bar
And I don't know if it's her or the rum

[Pre-Chorus]
I got my toes in the water, ass in the sand
Not a worry in the world, a cold beer in my hand
Life is good today, life is good today

[Chorus 2]
Adios and vaya con Dios
A long way from GA
Yes, and all the muchachas, they call me big papa
When I throw pesos their way
Adios and vaya con Dios
A long way from GA
Someone do me a favor and pour me some Jaeger
And I'll grab my guitar and play

[Instrumental Bridge]

[Chorus 3]
Adios and vaya con Dios
Going home now to stay
The señoritas don't care-o when there's no dinero
Yeah, I got no money to stay
Adios and vaya con Dios
Going home now to stay

[Outro]
I'm just going to drive up by the lake
And put my ass in a lawn chair, toes in the clay
Not a worry in the world, a PBR on the way
Life is good today, life is good today

[Verse 1]
She'd trade Colorado if he'd take her with him
Closes the door 'fore the winter lets the cold in
And wonders if her love is strong enough to make him stay
She's answered by the taillights shinin' through the window pane

[Chorus]
He said, I want to see you again
But I'm stuck in colder weather
Maybe tomorrow will be better
Can I call you then?
She said, you're ramblin' man
And you ain't ever gonna change
You've got a gypsy soul to blame
And you were born for leavin'

[Verse 2]
At a truck stop diner, just outside of Lincoln
The night is black as the coffee he was drinkin'
And in the waitress' eyes he sees the same old light is shinin'
He thinks of Colorado and the girl he left behind him

[Chorus]
He said, I want to see you again
But I'm stuck in colder weather
Maybe tomorrow will be better
Can I call you then?
She said, you're ramblin' man
And you ain't ever gonna change
You've got a gypsy soul to blame
And you were born for leavin'
Born for leavin'

[Bridge]
Well, it's a windin' road
When you're in the lost and found
You're a lover, I'm a runner
And we go 'round and 'round
And I love you, but I leave you
I don't want you, but I need you
You know it's you that calls me back here, baby

[Alternate Chorus]
Oh, I want to see you again
But I'm stuck in colder weather
Maybe tomorrow will be better
Can I call you then?
'Cause I'm a ramblin' man
I ain't ever gonna change
I've got a gypsy soul to blame
And I was born for leavin'
Born for leavin'

[Outro]
When I close my eyes I see you
No matter where I am
I can smell your perfume through these whisperin' pines
I'm with your ghost again
It's a shame about the weather
But I know soon we'll be together
And I can't wait 'til then
I can't wait 'til then

[Intro]
You know I like my chicken fried
Cold beer on a Friday night
A pair of jeans that fit just right
And the radio up

[Verse 1]
Well I was raised up beneath the shade of a Georgia Pine
And that's home you know
Sweet tea, pecan pie, and homemade wine where the peaches grow
And my house it's not much to talk about
But it's filled with love that's grown in southern ground

[Chorus]
And a little bit of chicken fried
Cold beer on a Friday night
A pair of jeans that fit just right
And the radio up
Well I've seen the sun rise
See the love in my woman's eyes
Feel the touch of a precious child
And know a mother's love

[Verse 2]
It's funny how it's the little things in life that mean the most
Not where you live, what you drive, or the price tag on your clothes
There's no dollar sign on a piece of mind
This I've come to know
So if you agree, have a drink with me
Raise your glasses for a toast

[Chorus]
To a little bit of chicken fried
Cold beer on a Friday night
A pair of jeans that fit just right
And the radio up
Well I've seen the sun rise
See the love in my woman's eyes
Feel the touch of a precious child
And know a mother's love

[Interlude]

[Verse 3]
I thank God for my life
And for the stars and stripes
May freedom forever fly, let it ring
Salute the ones who died
The ones that give their lives so we don't have to sacrifice
All the things we love

[Chorus]
Like our chicken fried
And cold beer on a Friday night
A pair of jeans that fit just right
And the radio up
Well I've seen the sun rise
See the love in my woman's eyes
Feel the touch of a precious child
And know a mother's love

Get your little chicken fried
Cold beer on a Friday night
A pair of jeans that fit just right
And the radio up
Well I've done seen the sun rise
See the love in my woman's eyes
Feel the touch of a precious child
And know a mother's love

[Verse 1]
Going to put the the world away for a minute
Pretend I don't live in it
Sunshine going to wash my blues away
Had sweet love but I lost it
She got too close so I fought her
Now I'm lost in the world trying to find me a better way

[Chorus]
Wishing I was knee deep in the water somewhere
Got the blue sky breeze and it don't seem fair
Only worry in the world is the tide going to reach my chair
Sunrise, there's a fire in the sky
Never been so happy
Never felt so high
And I think I might have found me my own kind of paradise

[Verse 2: Jimmy Buffett]
Wrote a note said be back in a minute
Bought a boat and I sailed off in it
Don't think anybody going to miss me anyway
Mind on a permanent vacation
The ocean is my only medication
Wishing my condition ain't ever going to go away

[Chorus]
Now I'm knee deep in the water somewhere
Got the blue sky breeze blowing wind through my hair
Only worry in the world is the tide going to reach my chair
Sunrise, there's a fire in the sky
Never been so happy
Never felt so high
And I think I might have found me my own kind of paradise

[Bridge]
This champagne shore washing over me
It's a sweet sweet life living by the salty sea
One day you could be as lost as me
Change your geography
Maybe you might be

[Chorus]
Knee deep in the water somewhere
Got the blue sky breeze blowing wind through my hair
Only worry in the world is the tide going to reach my chair
Sunrise, there's a fire in the sky
Never been so happy
Never felt so high
And I think I might have found me my own kind of paradise

[Outro]
Come on in the water's nice
Find yourself a little slice
Grab a backpack of lies
You never know until you try
When you lose yourself
You find the key to paradise

[Verse 1]
I got a piece of land out in the countryside
Lay back and smell the sun warm up the Georgia pine
Feels so good to be taking it easy
Why would I ever leave? Cause I know

[Chorus]
I got some good friends that live down the street
Got a good looking woman with her arms 'round me
Here in a small town, where it feels like home
I've got everything I need and nothing that I don't
Homegrown
Homegrown

[Verse 2]
We got a fire going down by the riverside
Sip whiskey out the bottle, living like we'll never die
Come on and stay a while if you don't believe me
Why would I ever leave, cause I know

[Chorus]
I got some good friends that live down the street
Got a good looking woman with her arms 'round me
Here in a small town, where it feels like home
I've got everything I need and nothing that I don't
Homegrown
Homegrown
I got some good friends that live down the street
Got a good looking woman with her arms 'round me
Here in a small town, where it feels like home
I've got everything I need
Homegrown
And nothing that I don't
Homegrown
Everything I need
Homegrown
And nothing I don't
Homegrown

[Bridge]
It's the weight that you carry from the things
That you think you want
It's the weight that you carry from the things
That you think you want
Weight you carry
It's the weight that you carry from the things
That you think you want
It's the weight that you carry from the things
That you think you want

[Outro]
I've got everything I need, nothing that I don't
Homegrown
Everything I need, nothing that I don't
Homegrown
Everything I need, nothing that I don't
Homegrown
Oh, everything I need and nothing that I don't
Homegrown

[Verse 1]
Hometown hero at the bar
Burned out high life super star
You know
Kept a buzz to fill the hole
Loved the lights and stole the show

[Pre-Chorus]
Someone I used to know
Would stay another round
Someone I used to know
Ran himself in the ground

[Chorus]
It’s been a long time comin’
Couldn’t keep on runnin’
Had to hit rock bottom to know
When you keep on losin’
With the path you’re choosin’
And it’s time to let go
Of someone that I used to know

[Post-Chorus]
Know, know
Know, know
Someone that I used to know

[Verse 2]
Rides the high that tears him down
Hates himself and loves the crowd
The king of fools, a heavy crown
He didn’t know he almost drowned

[Pre-Chorus]
Someone I used to know
Would stay another round
Someone I used to know
Ran himself in the ground

[Chorus]
It’s been a long time comin’
Couldn’t keep on runnin’
Had to hit rock bottom to know
When you keep on losin’
With the path you’re choosin’
And it’s time to let go
Of someone that I used to know

[Post-Chorus]
Know, know
Know, know

[Chorus]
It’s been a long time comin’
Couldn’t keep on runnin’
Had to hit rock bottom to know
When you keep on losin’
With the path you’re choosin’
And it’s time to let go
Of someone that I used to
Someone that I used to know
Know
Know, ooh

[Outro]
Know, know
Know, know
Know

[Verse 1]
I got a death wish
Her looks can kill
She’s got a red dress
Lipstick and heels
Pull me in
Get me hooked like a junkie
You got me feeling so high

[Chorus]
You’re such a beautiful drug
I can’t get enough
Addicted and I’m dying for a hit of your love
Got a death wish baby, baby
Don’t want you to save me, save me

[Verse 2]
She lets her hair down
And all of mine stand up
Can’t help but stare now
Gotta feel that touch
Her kiss, my fix, so sweet
Can’t quit those lips are a habit to me
Sweet intoxication and I’m never getting sober
I can tell that the effects are taking over
Pull me in
Get me hooked like a junkie
You got me feeling so high tonight

[Chorus]
You’re such a beautiful drug
I can’t get enough
I’m addicted and dying for a hit of your love
I’m losing it baby
Keep driving me crazy, crazy

[Bridge]
Going out of my mind
Staring at you
Burning up in your fire that I’ve fallen into
Got a death wish baby, baby
Don’t want you to save me, save me
Tonight

I wish you love
And happiness
I guess I wish
You all the best
I wish you don't
Do like I do
And go and fall in love with someone like you

Cause if you fell
Oh, like I did
You'd probably walk around the block like a little kid
But a kid don't know
He could only guess
How hard it is
To wish you happiness

Well I guess love
Is like a Christmas card
You decorate a tree
And throw it in the yard
It decays and dies
And the snowmen melt
Well I knew love
I knew how love felt

I knew love
Oh, and love knew me
When I walked around, love walked with me
But I got no hate
And I got no pride
But I got so much love that I cannot hide

So you drive a Chevy
So you drive a Ford
So you drive around all night till you just get bored
Then you change your mind
For something else to do
Then your heart changes your mind and it changes you

I wish you love
And happiness
I guess I wish
You all the best
I wish you don't
Do like I do
And go and fall in love with someone like you

If you fell
Oh, like I did
You'd probably walk around the block like a little kid
But a kid don't know
He could only guess
How hard it is
To wish you happiness
How hard it is
To wish you happiness

[Verse 1]
He was a giant
And I was just a kid
I was always trying
To do everything he did
I can still remember every lesson he taught me
Growing up learning how to be like my old man

[Verse 2]
He was a lion
We were our father's pride
But I was defiant
When he made me walk the line
He knew how to lift me up
And when to let me fall
Looking back, he always had a plan
My old man

[Chorus]
My old man
Feel the callous on his hands
And dusty overalls
My old man
Now I finally understand
I have a lot to learn
From my old man

[Verse 3]
Now I'm a giant
Got a son of my own
He's always trying
To go everywhere I go
Do the best I can to raise him up the right way
Hoping that he someday wants to be
Like his old man

[Break]

[Chorus]
My old man
I know one day we'll meet again
As he's looking down
My old man
I hope he's proud of who I am
I'm trying to fill the boot of my old man

[Outro]
My old man

Can’t tell where the sky begins and the water ends
No clouds to hide the sun
Waves playing me a symphony upon the sand
As I lay drifting on the ocean with this bottle in my hand

Sat down on the boardwalk for a little while
Your memory my company
Something about this place had a way to make you smile
You always loved the sound of waves

The wind whistling across my bottle still can’t blow away the sorrow
That tomorrow you won’t be here with me
So I raise it up and toast the day we met
Won’t forget the way you love me, amazing way you love me

[Chorus]
It’s bittersweet, you see
You’re not here but I can feel you
Every memory is on the tip of my tongue
Close my eyes, see your face, hold on tight to yesterday
And when I wake, it was just a dream
It’s bittersweet

Doctor said there’s nothing we can do
Took my hand said take me home
To the only place half a chance to take the pain away
Let me feel alive before I go

You said life is only borrowed
So let’s wash away our sorrow
That tomorrow I won’t be here with you
Go and live your life with no regrets and don’t forget how much I love you
I love you

[Chorus]
It’s bittersweet, you see
You’re not here but I can feel you
Every memory is on the tip of my tongue
Close my eyes, see your face, hold on tight to yesterday
And when I wake, it was just a dream
It’s bittersweet

I brought you back just like you wanted
So you don’t ever have to leave
And when I poured you across the southern sky, I couldn’t help but to cry
I know you finally got your wings

Bitter-bittersweet
Bittersweet

The wind whistling across my bottle still can’t blow away the sorrow
That tomorrow you won’t be here with me
So I raise it up and toast the day we met
Won’t forget the way you love me, amazing way you love me
It’s bittersweet

[Verse 1]
Every morning when you come downstairs
Hair's a mess but I don't care
No makeup on and shining so bright
My old sweatshirt never fit so right
Dancing around to the radio
Humming the words that you don't know
Cross off finding an angel off my list
Thinking that it don't get no better than this

[Chorus]
You make loving you easy
You make loving you all I wanna do
Every little smile and every single touch
Reminds me just how much it all makes
Loving you easy

[Verse 2]
Wrapped around me late at night
Pillow talk by candle light
Gonna slow this down and make it last
The best things fly by us so fast

[Chorus]
You make loving you easy
You make loving you all I wanna do
Every little smile and every single touch
Reminds me just how much it all makes
Loving you easy

[Bridge]
Oh, I wanna sing it again

[Chorus]
You make loving you easy
You make loving you all I wanna do
Every little smile and every single touch
Reminds me just how much it all makes
Loving you easy

[Chorus 1: Chris Cornell]
Heavy is the head that wears the crown
Heavy is the head that wears the crown

[Verse 1: Zac Brown]
Black dog drinks from the water trying to cool his tongue
Like the king, finds no peace, his work is never done
Night falls, smoke on the water, darkness closes in
Cold white hand in the deep will drown you for your sins

[Chorus 2: Zac Brown]
It's a life long expedition
Second guessing your decisions
Trying to find out what's been missing
Pages keep on filling

[Bridge: Zac Brown]
Crying out "Go and wake the king"
Call to arms for those who kiss the ring
Stand your ground, the walls are coming down
It's do or die! Do or die!

[Chorus 1: Chris Cornell]
Heavy is the head that wears the crown
Heavy is the head that wears the crown

[Verse 2: Zac Brown]
Mad man, blood on the altar, The Queen will have his head
His ghost will shake those rattling chains long after he's dead
No soul knows his trouble high upon his throne
Loved by few and judged by many, he bears that weight alone

[Chorus 2: Chris Cornell]
It's a life long expedition
Second guessing your decisions
Trying to find out what's been missing
Pages keep on filling

[Bridge: Chris Cornell]
Crying out "Go and wake the king"
Call to arms for those who kiss the ring
Stand your ground, yeah the walls are coming down
It's do or die! Do or die!

[Chorus 1: Chris Cornell]
Heavy is the head that wears the crown
Heavy is the head that wears the crown
Heavy is the head that wears the crown

[Verse 1]
I ride east every other Friday but if I had it my way
The day would not be wasted on this drive
And I want so bad to hold you
Son, there's things I haven't told you
Your mom and me couldn't get along

[Chorus]
So I'll drive
And I think about my life
And wonder why, That I slowly die inside
Every time I turn that truck around, right at the Georgia line and I count the days and the miles back home to you on that Highway 20 ride

[Verse 2]
A day might come and you'll realize that if you could see through my eyes
There was no other way to work it out
And a part of you might hate me
But son please don't mistake me for a man that didn't care at all

[Chorus]
And I'll drive
And I'll think about my life
And wonder why, That I slowly die inside
Every time I turn that truck around, right at the Georgia line and I count the days and the miles back home to you on that Highway 20 ride

[Outro]
So when you drive
And the years go flying by
I hope you smile
If I ever cross your mind
It was a pleasure of my life
And I cherished every time
And my whole world
It begins and ends with you
On that Highway 20 ride

[Verse 1]
She's got eyes that cut you like a knife
And lips that taste like sweet red wine
And her pretty legs go to heaven every time
She got a gentle way that puts me at ease
When she walks in a room I can hardly breathe
Got a devastating smile knock a grown man to his knees

[Chorus]
She's got whatever it is
It blows me away
She's everything I want to say to a woman
But I couldn't find the words to say
She's got whatever it is
I don't know what to do
And every time I try and tell her how I feel
It comes out "I love you"
You got whatever it is

[Verse 2]
You know I've never been the type that would ever want to stay
Bring 'em home at night and they're gone the next day
But that all changed when she walked into my life
People ask me what it is
I tell them I don't know
There's just something about the woman makes my heart go haywire
She's gonna be my wife

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
When she loves me
Girl that's how I feel
When she loves me I'm on top of the world
Because when she loves me I can live forever
When she loves me I am untouchable

[Chorus]

Pour me another one
Make it a strong one
We’re gonna have some fun tonight

I wanna be a castaway
And leave the world behind
Take a tropic holiday
Say goodbye to keeping time
Wasting away down by the coast
Pacifico and chasing lime
Easy living down in paradise

Pour me another one
Make it a strong one
We’re gonna have some fun tonight
Just like the other one
Make it a double rum
We’re gonna castaway tonight

I’m in an island state of mind
Don’t think I’m ever gonna leave
I’d rather stay and watch the waves
Move the sand beneath my feet
Reggae on the radio
Laying low and feeling high
Easy living down in paradise

Pour me another one
Make it a strong one
We’re gonna have some fun tonight
Just like the other one
Make it a double rum
We’re gonna castaway tonight
Castaway

[Chorus]
Castaway
Ride the waves like we’re young
‘Cause time flies by and soon we’ll be older
It’s better to live in the moment
Than stuck in the past
Fast asleep as the world passes by

Ay ay yo
Where reality is history
Oh yo eh
Come and castaway with me
Ay ay yo
The good times are free and
Nobody can take that away
Oh yo eh
Come and castaway with me

Pour me another one
(Smiling in the islands, I’ve been)
Make it a strong one
We’re gonna have some fun tonight
(For a little while I’ll be a castaway
Gonna let the sun shine in)
Just like the other one
(Smiling in the islands, I’ve been)
Make it a double rum
We’re gonna castaway tonight
(For a little while I’ll be a castaway
Gonna let the sunshine in)

Pour me another one
(Smiling in the islands, I’ve been)
Make it a strong one
We’re gonna have some fun tonight
(For a little while I’ll be a castaway
Gonna let the sun shine in)
Just like the other one
(Smiling in the islands, I’ve been)
Make it a double rum
We’re gonna castaway tonight
(For a little while I’ll be a castaway, castaway
Gonna let the sunshine in)
(Smiling in the islands, I’ve been
Make it a strong one
We’re gonna have some fun tonight)

[Verse 1]
It was in a crystal bottle on his desk
He'd save it for the times to not forget
I missed the way he'd share with me
The things that he held true
While the lessons rolled around his 80 proof
All it took was...

[Pre-Chorus 1]
One sip and it blew my mind
Those good ol' boys sure make it right
Knowing smooth whiskey takes some time
Ain't nothing like the real thing
And you can't go back once you get a taste
Everything is second rate
I'm talking genuine Made in the USA
Ain't nothing like the real thing

[Chorus]
Real thing
There ain't nothing like the real thing baby
There ain't nothing like the...
Real thing
There ain't nothing like the real thing baby

[Verse 2]
I thought I'd been in love a time or two
Didn't know that I was lost till I met you
And I could tell that every other girl was history
Never knew how real could feel till you found me
All it took was...

[Pre-Chorus 2]
One kiss, and you blew my mind
An All-American kind of fine
You a know a, good woman is hard to find
Ain't nothing like the real thing
And you can't go back once you get a taste
Everyone is second rate
I'm talking genuine Made in the USA
Ain't nothing like the real thing

[Chorus]
The real thing
There ain't nothing like the real thing baby
There ain't nothing like the...
Real thing
There ain't nothing like the real thing baby
There ain't nothing like the...
Real thing
There ain't nothing like the real thing baby
There ain't nothing like the...
Real thing
There ain't nothing like the real thing baby
There ain't nothing...

[Verse 3]
You know a, great song is hard to find
The right words and the perfect rhyme
'Cause we, all feel the same inside
We're all looking for the real thing

[Pre-Chorus 3]
You know you're not the same once you hear it play
There's nothing else that can replace
What's genuine Made in the USA
Ain't nothing like the real thing
I'm talking genuine Made in the USA
Ain't nothing like the real thing

[Instrumental]

[Outro]
Real thing
There ain't nothing like the real thing baby
There ain't nothing like the...
Real thing
There ain't nothing like the real thing baby

[Verse 1]
I saw the sun begin to dim
And felt that winter wind blow cold
A man learns who is there for him
When the glitter fades and the walls won't hold
'Cause from then, rubble
What remains can only be what's true
If all was lost, it's more I've gained
'Cause it led me back to you

[Chorus]
And from now on, these eyes will not be blinded by the lights
From now on, what's waited 'til tomorrow starts tonight, tonight
And let this promise in me start like an anthem in my heart
From now on, from now on

[Verse 2]
I drank champagne with kings and queens
The politicians praised my name
But those are someone else's dreams
The pitfalls of the man I became
For years and years, I chased their cheers
At the crazy speed of always needing more
But when I stop and see you here
I remember who all this was for

[Chorus]
And from now on, these eyes will not be blinded by the lights
And from now on, what's waited 'til tomorrow starts tonight
It starts tonight
And let this promise in me start like an anthem in my heart
From now on, from now on, from now on

[Bridge]
And we will come back home
And we will come back home, home again
And we will come back home
And we will come back home, home again
And we will come back home
And we will come back home, home again

[Chorus]
From now on, these eyes will not be blinded by the lights
And from now on, what's waited 'til tomorrow starts tonight
It starts tonight
And let this promise in me start like an anthem in my heart
From now on, from now on, from now on

[Outro]
And we will come back home
And we will come back home, home again
And we will come back home
And we will come back home, home again
From now on, from now on, home again

[Verse 1: Zac Brown]
We never spoke a word
But every thought she had, I heard
From across the room
We were standing face to face
I couldn't find the words to say
Give me one more move
I don't even know her name
I guess foolish pride's to blame

[Chorus: Zac Brown]
Now I'm falling in love as she's walking away
And my heart won't tell my mind
To tell my mouth what it should say
I may have lost this battle
Live to fight another day
Now I'm falling in love as she's walking away

[Verse 2: Zac Brown & Alan Jackson]
Wise man next to me did say
About the one that got away
Son, I missed my chance
Don't you let regret take place
Of the dreams you have to chase
Ask her to dance
(Go on son)

[Pre-Chorus: Alan Jackson]
You might fall down on your face
Roll the dice and have some faith

[Chorus: Alan Jackson]
Don't be falling in love as she's walking away
When your heart won't tell your mind
To tell your mouth what it should say
You may have lost this battle
Live to fight another day
Don't be falling in love as she's walking away

[Pre-Chorus: Alan Jackson]
You might fall down on your face
Roll the dice and have some faith

[Chorus: Zac Brown & Alan Jackson]
Don't be falling in love as she's walking away
When your heart won't tell your mind
To tell your mouth what it should say
You may have lost this battle
Live to fight another day
Don't be falling in love as she's walking away

[Verse 1]
My first best friend was a 6 string
Took him with me everywhere I go
When I was 18, bought a Dodge van
Found a drummer and made the road my home

[Pre-Chorus]
Ooh, I wouldn't change a thing
It made the man I am today

[Chorus]
My roots always keep me grounded
Roots, remind me where I'm from
Even when I'm a thousand miles away from my roots
I'm home

[Verse 2]
Every Friday, you could find me
At Dixie Tavern, playin' with my band
We'd start the show with a round of whiskey
And play our hearts out and wished it'd never end

[Pre-Chorus]
Ooh, I wouldn't change a thing
It made the man I am today

[Chorus]
My roots always keep me grounded
Roots, remind me where I'm from
Even when I'm a thousand miles away from my roots
I'm home

[Verse 3]
We'd get 'em singin' "Don't Stop Believing"
Then follow up with a cold beer on a Friday night
Always dreamin' one day we'd play with
All our heroes we cover every night

[Pre-Chorus]
Flyin' high all our dreams came true
You've given me wings

[Chorus]
And roots, always keep me grounded
Roots, remind me where I'm from
Even when I'm a thousand miles away from my roots
I'm home
My roots, always keep me grounded
Roots, remind me where I'm from
My roots, even when I'm a thousand miles away from my roots
I'm home

[Outro]
Don't give up
Hold on a little longer
What don't kill you
Only makes you stronger
Don't give up
Hold on a little longer
What don't kill you
Only makes you stronger
Don't give up
Hold on a little longer
What don't kill you
Only makes you stronger
Don't give up
Hold on a little longer
What don't kill you
Only makes you stronger
Don't give up
Hold on a little longer
What don't kill you
Only gives you stronger roots

[Verse 1]
So we live in our old van
Travel all across this land
Me and you
We'll end up hand in hand
Somewhere down on the sand
Just me and you

[Chorus]
Just as free
Free as we'll ever be
Just as free
Free as we'll ever be

[Verse 2]
We drive until the city lights
Dissolve into a country sky
Just me and you
Lay underneath the harvest moon
Do all the things that lovers do
Just me and you

[Chorus]
Just as free
Free as we'll ever be
Just as free
Free as we'll ever be

[Bridge]
No we don't have a lot of money
No we don't have a lot of money
No we don't have a lot of money
All we need is love

[Chorus]
Just as free
Free as we'll ever be
Just as free
Free as we'll ever be

[Outro]
So we live in our old van
Travel all across this land
Me and you

[Verse 1]
Although the years have changed now
And we go by different names
I remember the sound of our roof in the rain
And my mind goes back in time
To a place so far gone
Where the love we left behind us
Was still new
We were listening to a record
On the end of your bed
Not giving thought to where it was all going
And I wished right then and there so badly
I could read your mind
Just so I could know the things that you were knowing

[Chorus]
I believe, yes I do
The hardest part is always leaving love behind
I believe, yes I do
That everything we lose
Will be a gift in time
But the hardest part is leaving love behind

[Verse 2]
When it was time to say goodbye
Those words came down like stones
I admit for so long after
It was hard to feel at home
We would hear the highway’s song
Shifting down in the night
I was grateful that the echoes broke the quiet

[Chorus]
I believe, yes I do
The hardest part is always leaving love behind
I believe, yes I do
That everything we lose
Will be a gift in time
But the hardest part is leaving love behind

[Verse 3]
The sun fades on me now
And I miss you like words can’t know
And I missed my shot at dying young a long time ago
It’s just a lesson learned in love
It's not angry, it's not sad
Sometimes you gotta lose something
To know what you have

[Chorus]
I believe (I believe), yes I do
The hardest part is always leaving love behind
I believe (I believe), yes I do
Oh, that everything we lose
Will be a gift in time
(I believe), I believe, (Yes I do)
The hardest part is leaving love behind

[Verse 1]
What can you see from your window?
I can't see anything from mine
Flags on the side of the highway
And scripture on grocery store signs
Maybe eighteen is too early
Maybe thirty or forty is too
Did you get your chance to make peace with the man
Before he sent down his angels for you?

[Chorus 1]
Mamas and grandmamas love you
Cause that's all they know how to do
You never planned on the bombs in the sand
Or sleeping in your dress blues

[Verse 2]
Your wife said this all would be funny
When you came back home in a week
You'd turn twenty-two and we'd celebrate you
In a bar or a tent by the creek
Your baby would just about be here
Your very last tour would be up
But you won't be back. They're all dressing in black
Drinking sweet tea in styrofoam cups

[Chorus 2]
Mamas and grandmamas love you
American boys hate to lose
You never planned on the bombs in the sand
Or sleeping in your dress blues

[Verse 3]
Now the high school gymnasium's ready
Full of flowers and old legionnaires
Nobody showed up to protest
They just sniffle and stare
But there's red, white, and blue in the rafters
There's silent old men from the corps
What did they say when they shipped you away
To give all in some God awful war?

[Chorus 3]
Nobody here could forget you
You showed us what we had to lose
You never planned on the bombs in the sand
Or sleeping in your dress blues
Oh, you never planned on the bombs in the sand
Or sleeping in your dress blues

[Outro]
You never planned on the bombs in the sand
Or sleeping in your dress blues

[Verse 1]
I've been burning bright
For so long I can't remember
Pretty girls and late night bars seem to be my line of work
Believe me when I say, I can't stay this high forever
This man has had all he can stand, time to lay this body down

[Chorus]
Sweet Annie
Can I stay with you a while?
'Cause this road's been putting miles on my heart
Sweetheart I've been living in a fantasy
But one day, lightning will strike
And my bark will lose its bite
But don't give up on me
Sweet Annie

[Verse 2]
Sweet Annie
I know I promised you a life
But with an empty bed and the words I said don't carry any weight
If I could take back yesterday, find a way to start it over
Turn around, put that bottle down and I'd pray it's not too late

[Chorus]
Sweet Annie
Can I stay with you a while?
'Cause this road's been putting miles on my heart
Sweetheart I've been living in a fantasy
But one day, lightning will strike
And my bark will lose its bite
But don't give up on me
What will be will be
Sweet Annie

[Verse 3]
Turn out the light
These hands they long to hold you
Fall all over you
All over again
Come a little closer so I can show you
My heart still beats fast for you
All over, and over again

[Chorus]
Sweet Annie
Can I stay with you a while?
'Cause this road's been putting miles on my heart
Sweetheart I've been living in a fantasy
But one day, lightning will strike
And my bark will lose its bite
But don't give up on me
Sweet Annie

[Chorus]
Darlin', pack a suitcase
Let's get away and start over
Smoke a J by the waves while we sip on some ice cold Corona
Let's take it back in the day to when we first knew it was over
Let's take time to fall in love again

[Verse 1]
Let's turn off our phones just for tonight
It's been way too long since it's been just you and I
We got so caught up in life that we lost that fire
Baby, I know we can light it up again

[Chorus]
Darlin', pack a suitcase
Let's get away and start over
Smoke a J by the waves while we sip on some ice cold Corona
Let's take it back in the day to when we first knew it was over
Let's take time to fall in love again
(Take time to fall in love again)

[Verse 2]
Let's catch the first plane that leaves to the sea
I'll go anywhere just as long as you're there with me
And you see it won't take no time to get back that fire
Baby, I know we can light it up again

[Chorus]
Darlin', pack a suitcase
Let's get away and start over
Smoke a J by the waves while we sip on some ice cold Corona
Let's take it back in the day to when we first knew it was over
Let's take time to fall in love again
(Take time to fall in love again)

[Bridge]
Fall in love again
Fall in love again
Let's make love again
Let take time to fall in love again

[Chorus]
Won't you sing it with me now?
Darlin', pack a suitcase
Let's get away and start over
Smoke a J by the waves while we sip on some ice cold Corona
Let's take it back in the day to when we first knew it was over
Let's take time to fall in love again
(Take time to fall in love again)
Let's take time to fall in love again
(Take time to fall in love again)
Let's take time to fall in love again
(Take time to fall in love again)

[Verse 1]
Spent the night with a friend of mine and a handle of good whiskey
We picked guitars and talked about how the glory days we missed them
And it didn't take too long to find the truth inside that bottle
Cast a sea so long ago was a message from my father

[Chorus]
You keep your heart above your head and your eyes wide open
So this world can't find a way to leave you cold
And know you're not the only ship out on the ocean
Save your strength for things that you can change
Forgive the ones you can't
You've got to let them go

[Verse 2]
Looking back now on my life, I can't say I regret it
And all the places that I ended up, not the way Ma would have had it
But you only get one chance at life to leave your mark upon it
And when a pony comes riding by you, better set your sweet ass on it

[Chorus]
You keep your heart above your head and your eyes wide open
So this world can't find a way to leave you cold
And know you're not the only ship out on the ocean
Save your strength for things that you can change
Forgive the ones you can't
You've got to let them go


[Bridge][x2]
Like a sweet sunset in Georgia, let it go
And like the fear that grabs a hold of you, let it go
Let it go

[Chorus]
You keep your heart above your head and your eyes wide open
So this world can't find a way to leave you cold
And know you're not the only ship out on the ocean
Save your strength for things that you can change
Forgive the ones you can't
You've got to let them go

[Verse 1]
First time I saw you, I just couldn’t look away
Found what I’d been lookin’ for, but I couldn’t stay
But my heart was full and my eyes, they could not believe
How you wrapped your arms around me
Your majesty

[Chorus]
I wanna slow it down where the water’s deep
Get that Northern healing washing over me
Made me better man
And it’s plain to see
The nature of your beauty puts my mind at ease

[Post-Chorus]
Uh, oh (Uh, oh)
Oooh
Uh, oh (Uh,oh)

[Verse 2]
Now I’m flyin’ in to meet you, I can hardly wait
Do you know how much I’ve missed you since I’ve been away
Bringin' all my love from Georgia, and I'm gonna lay
Under endless skies of emerald light, we can drift away

[Chorus]
I wanna slow it down where the water’s deep
Get that Northern healing washing over me
Made me better man
And it’s plain to see
The nature of your beauty puts my mind at ease
And I’m humbled in the presence of your majesty

[Post-Chorus]
Uh, oh (Uh, oh)
Oooh
Uh, oh (Uh,oh)

Uh, oh (Uh, oh)
Oooh
Uh, oh (Uh,oh)

[Bridge]
You can have it all
Burn all my things
To be at your feet
And kneel before my queen

[Chorus]
Now I’m gonna stay out where the air is clean
‘Cause I’ve freed myself from these city streets
Found a better man waking inside of me
The nature of your beauty puts my mind at ease
And I’m humbled in the presence of your majesty
And I kneel down in the presence of
Your majesty

[Post-Chorus]
Ooh!
Uh, oh (Uh, oh)
Oooh
Uh, oh (Uh, oh)
Uh, oh, oh-oh

Uh, oh (Uh, oh)
Oh, oh

[Verse 1]
I could tell that it was over
When her lips met mine
There was an emptiness in her voice
Hesitation when she smiled
She didn't have to say a word
It was just so plain to see
She'd found what she'd been looking for
And I knew it wasn't me

[Chorus 1]
I saw goodbye in her eyes
I don't think I can change it
There's no way to disguise
We will never make it

[Verse 2]
Sometimes I feel like a clown
Can't wash off his makeup
The life she wanted, it was gone
Prince Charming I wasn't
But I would trade a thousand Babylons
To be in her arms tomorrow
Oh, but like the tide, her love has come and gone
And it's time for me to go

[Chorus 2]
I saw goodbye in her eyes
I don't think I can change it
There's no way to disguise
We will never make it (now she sees right through me)
Should I hold on to what we have got?
Is it just a waste of time?
One thing that I know for sure
I saw goodbye in her eyes
I saw goodbye in her eyes

[Bridge]
I know you got somebody new now
All my candles have burned out
He is going to love the way you shine (so did I)
So did I
So don't smile at me if it ain't what you mean
(Goodbye)

[Chorus 3]
With that goodbye in your eyes
I know that I can't change it (now you see right through me)
There's no way to disguise
We will never make it
I saw goodbye in your eyes
I know that I can't change it (now you see right through me goodbye in your eyes)
Should I hold on?
We will never make it (now you see right through me goodbye in your eyes)
Should I hold on?
Is it just a waste of time?
One thing that I know for sure
I saw goodbye in your eyes

[Outro]
I saw goodbye in your eyes
I know that it's over

[Verse 1]
Made me grow
Then you cut me down
A north wind on a garden growing
You made me think you were mine
Then you changed your mind
I'm lost as a feather
In a hurricane
There's no way to measure
If I'll ever OK, OK let me tell you

[Pre-Chorus]
There's no good reason why
I can't move on
I lay my heart on these tracks
When your train comes along

[Chorus]
And it was all alright
Now it's all, all wrong
That's just how
It goes when you're gone

[Verse 2]
You may not realize
All the lies at the time but
The truth will find you
Storm is going to come
Going to wash you away like Sodom and Gomorrah

[Pre-Chorus]
There's no good reason why
I can't move on
I lay my heart on these tracks
When your train comes along

[Chorus]
And it was all alright
Now it's all, all wrong
That's just how
It goes when you're wrong

[Guitar solo]

[Verse 3]
Go out in circles
Like an old golden bed
As cold as the pillow
By your empty nightstand
Then something comes over me
I lose my head
I guess god did not make me
A one woman man

[Bridge]
I'd have a lot to give
If I still gave a damn
That's just how
It goes when you're wrong

[Chorus]
And it was all alright
Now it's all all wrong
But that's just how
It goes when you're gone

[Outro]
And it was all alright
Now it's all wrong
And that's just how
It goes when you're gone
When you're gone
When you're long long gone

[Verse 1]
I have lived in a junkyard
Where the weeds eat up the rain
If you get anything there out of place
You know there's hell to pay

[Chorus]
And he said, "You're as sick as you are lovely
And in need of a hand."
He tells me, "You are never worthy,"
But I was just a child, you see?
That was my reality

[Verse 2]
He had a sick little girl
Dirty and hard, with a breast plate made of metal
She drives all day in her rusty Buick
And her feet don't reach the pedals
Got a jar of flies, father's disguise
Where his heart should be
Her mouth is sewn together
She screams with those eyes (Screams with those eyes)
She screams with those eyes

[Chorus]
"She fell sick, she is lovely
And in need of my hand." (Yeah he uses his hands)
He tells her, "You are never worthy."
She was all alone, you see?
That was her reality

[Bridge]
Yeah, when I should have been sleeping
Should have been dreaming
But I wake up to broken glass
There'll be one more empty desk in my homeroom class
I got an old bone pocket knife tight in my right hand
To save my poor mother from the junkyard man!

[Chorus]
He's as sick as she is lovely
And in need of a hand
He will know he's not worthy
When he dies alone, you see?
That's his reality

[Chorus]
I'm not sick, I am lovely
Hatred is the curse of man
I will not feel unworthy
Because I have washed my hands, you see?
That's my reality

[Verse 1]
How come all the pretty girls like you are taken baby
I've been looking for someone like you to save me
Life's too easy to be so damn complicated
Take your time and I'll be waiting

[Chorus]
Keep me in mind
Somewhere down the road, you might get lonely
Keep me in mind
And I pray someday that you will love me only

[Verse 2]
I think about you somedays
And the way I would lay and waste a day after day with you
We always go our separate ways
But no one can love you baby the way I do

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Well, the world can be real tough
Find shelter in me
If there's no one else to love
Keep me in mind
If ever you wanted me, I'll be your man
I'd be a fool to let you go with someone else
Whatever you want from me, I'll be your man
I'd give it all up just to have you for myself

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
Well, the world can be real tough
Why don't you hold on to me
When there's no one else to love

[Outro]
Keep me in mind
(Keep me in mind)
And I'll hold you, darling
(Keep me in mind)
I'll be your man
(Keep me in mind)
I'll hold you, darling
(Keep me in mind)
Come on little mama
Put it on me

[Pre-Chorus]
The Southern wind sings again an island lullaby

[Verse 1]
Baby powder beach under my feet has got me rolling
And the breeze through crackling leaves like a daytime campfire burning
And the ship is off to sea
And the wake it is a churning
As the southern wind sings again an island lullaby

[Chorus]
You can jump right in
Let the music pull you in
You can jump right in
Oh, and lose yourself again
As the southern wind sings again an island lullaby

[Verse 2]
There's a place the locals go and no one knows where to find it
And the river starts to flow inside the clouds of Misty Mountain
The water from this stone below becomes a blue-green fountain
As the southern wind sings again an island lullaby

[Chorus]
You can jump right in
Let the music pull you in
You can jump right in
Oh, and lose yourself again
As the southern wind sings again an island lullaby

[Bridge]
You can find me where the music meets the ocean
If you get the notion
Stop on by and play a while
A simple tune to get your love light glowing
Keep your heart wide open
Disappear just like the tide
Let it roll on by

[Chorus]
And jump right in
Let the music pull you in
You can jump right in
Oh, and lose yourself again
As the southern wind sings again an island lullaby

[Outro]
The Southern wind sings again an island lullaby
Island lullaby

I’ve been looking for a sound
That makes my heart sing
Been looking for a melody
That makes the church bells ring
Not looking for the fame
Or the fortune it might bring
In love, in music, in life

Jesus preached the golden rule
Buddha taught it too
Gandhi said eye for an eye
Makes the whole world go blind
With a little understanding
We can break these chains
That we’ve been handed
I’ve got the medication
Love is the remedy

Pray to be stronger and wiser
Know you get what you give
Love one another
Amen (amen), amen

I’ve been thinking about the mark
That I’ll be leaving
Been looking for a truth
I can believe in
I got everything I need
Let this heart be my guide
In love, in music, in life

I’m not saying I’m a wise man
Heaven knows there’s much that I’m still finding
Making my way down this winding road
Holding on to what I love
Yeah, and leaving the rest behind
For love, for music, for life

Pray to be stronger and wiser
Know you get what you give
Love one another

(Love is the remedy)
We’re all in this world together
Life’s a gift that we have to treasure
Happiness, now that is the measure
Love is the remedy
(Love is the remedy)

Everyone can be forgiven
One love and one religion
Open up your heart and listen
Love is the remedy

Pray to be stronger and wiser
And know you get what you give
God is love one another
Amen (amen), amen, amen (amen)

[Chorus 1]
Cocaine flame in my bloodstream
Sold my coat when I hit Spokane

[Verse 1]
Bought myself a hard pack of cigarettes
In the early morning rain
Lately my hands they don't feel like mine
My eyes been stung with dust and blind
Held you in my arms one time
Lost you just the same

[Pre-Chorus]
Jolene
Well, I'm not about to go straight, it's too late
And I found myself face down in the ditch
Booze in my hair, blood on my lips
A picture of you holding a picture of me
In the pocket of my blue jeans
Still don't know what love means
Still don't know what love means

[Chorus 2]
Jolene
Jolene

[Verse 2]
It's been so long since I've seen your face
Or felt a part of this human race
I've been living out of this here suitcase
For way too long
Man needs something he can hold onto
Nine pound hammer or a woman like you
Either one of them things will do

[Pre-Chorus]
Jolene
Well, I'm not about to go straight, it's too late
And I found myself face down in the ditch
Booze in my hair, blood on my lips
A picture of you holding a picture of me
In the pocket of my blue jeans
Still don't know what love means
Still don't know what love means

[Chorus 2]
Jolene
Jolene

[Chorus 1]
Cocaine flame in my bloodstream
Sold my coat when I hit Spokane

[Verse 1]
I've been climbing my way through the sky
Searching for answers that I'll never find
Losing my breath as I fall
Learning to fly, letting go of it all
Learning to fly, letting go of it all
I've been trying to open my eyes
Take it all in as the world passes by
Getting lost in the twists and the turn
Finding these questions inside me still burn
Finding these questions inside me still burn

[Chorus]
I'm gonna live
Like tomorrow never comes
There's no end in sight
Tonight we black out the sun
Better hold on tight
Before you know it's gone
And live like tomorrow never comes

[Verse 2]
I keep looking for some kind of sign
Trying to hold on in this race against time
I can't say where the next bend might be
That is the beauty in life's mystery
That is the beauty in life's mystery

[Chorus]
I'm gonna live
Like tomorrow never comes
There's no end in sight
Tonight we black out the sun
Better hold on tight
Before you know it's gone
And live like tomorrow never comes

[Bridge]
There's no end in sight
For tonight we black out the sun

[Verse 1]
He was born in the woods
Torn from his home
Well, he was naked
And destined
To be out on his own
And he waited in darkness
Hoping someone might see
From something so rough
What a treasure he'd be

[Chorus]
Stronger than steel and wood
Seen me through the bad and good
And when I'm hanging by a string
Every little thing
Is understood
Between Martin and me

[Verse 2]
Well he's hollow in the middle
From the shape that he's in
He's either filled up with music
Or locked in his shell again
And it takes some fine tuning
To make him come around
But he's a huge piece of me
And I'll never put him down

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
He is a good friend
And he has his own voice
And you get what you give
Sometimes it's just noise
But if you treat him well
He will last your life long
And if you're honest and open
Well, he will write you a song
(Write you a song, write you a song)

[Chorus][x2]

[Verse 1: Zac Brown]
Waiting for the sunlight
To come rising from the sea
We lay undercover
Shaded by the mango tree
We could stay forever
Never leave this paradise
Swaying in the ocean breeze
To the rhythm of the tide

[Pre-Chorus: Zac Brown]
Tomorrow, oh tomorrow
Take your time, ‘cause we got
Time to borrow

[Chorus: Zac Brown]
I love you
Say that you love me too
And we can turn the
Whole world upside down
Just us two
Nobody else will do
‘Cause baby, you’re the
Only one for me
Underneath the mango tree

[Verse 2: Sara Bareilles]
Drifting like the ocean
Daydreams dancing in the wind
Sand is sticking to our bodies
Just like sugar on our skin
The day is getting older
Oh, but we are still so young
Higher than the stars above
And faded like the sun

[Pre-Chorus: Zac Brown and Sara Bareilles]
Tomorrow, oh tomorrow
Take your time, ‘cause we got
Time to borrow

[Chorus: Zac Brown and Sara Bareilles]
I love you
Say that you love me too
And we can turn the
Whole world upside down
Just us two
Nobody else will do
‘Cause baby, you’re the
Only one for me
(Oh you are so sweet)
Underneath the mango tree

I love you
(I know you do)
Say that you love me too
And we can turn the
Whole world upside down
Just us two
Nobody else will do
‘Cause baby, you’re the
Only one for me
Baby you are the only one for me
Underneath the mango tree

[Intro]
Aha, you thought we were done huh
We've got more

[Pre-Chorus]
Sic 'em on a chicken
Sic 'em on a chicken
Sic 'em on a chicken and watch them feathers fly

[Chorus]
Sic 'em on a chicken
Sic 'em on a chicken
Break out the butter and the flour we're ready to fry

[Verse 1]
My dog Pete is the smallest dog of all the dogs in my yard
He's a mean son of a bitch
Drinks Beam and water from a broken mason jar

[Pre-Chorus]
And we sic 'em on a chicken
Sic 'em on a chicken
Sic 'em on a chicken and watch them feathers fly

[Chorus]
Sic 'em on a chicken
Sic 'em on a chicken
Break out the butter and the flour we're ready to fry

[Instrumental]

[Verse 2]
I heard this awful noise coming out of the woods (coming out of the woods)
I heard chicken screams
Know it wasn't going to be good

[Pre-Chorus]
I think we lost a chicken
I think we lost a chicken
I think we lost a chicken cos I just heard her cry

[Chorus]
I think we lost a chicken
I think we lost a chicken
But you can get another one for a dollar seventy-nine

[Instrumental]

[Verse 3]
Over a couple of years his spurs have grown
He wasn't safe to keep around the home
When he almost took an eyeball from Lonny's son
And I was in the kitchen making fig preserves
And I heard that young'n getting kicked in the face
And I knew it was the day that that rooster was going to get what he deserved

[Pre-Chorus]
So I chased the chicken
I chased the chicken
I chased the chicken and Pete hit him from the side

[Chorus]
I chased the chicken
I chased the chicken
Me & Pete suppered on a homemade chicken pot-pie

[Instrumental]

(That's awesome)

[Pre-Chorus]
Well sic 'em on a chicken
Sic 'em on a chicken
Sic 'em on a chicken and watch them feathers fly

[Chorus]
Sic 'em on a chicken
Sic 'em on a chicken
I can smell the kitchen and it's almost supper time

[Outro]
You're damn right I liked my chicken fried, yeah

[Verse 1: Zac Brown]
Early morning in a motel room
Sunshine trying to creep on through
Lost sleep but I found a tune
Stuck inside my head
Cigarettes and tank of gas
Headed off to nowhere fast
Got to find a way to make this feeling last

[Bridge: Zac Brown]
Because I believe that I
Was born with a song inside of me
Never question why
I just kept on chasing that melody
And as time goes by
It is funny how time can make you realize
We are running out of it

[Chorus: Zac Brown]
On the day that I die
I want to say that I
Was a man who really lived and never compromised
And when I have lived out my days
Until the very end
I hope they find me in my home, a guitar in my hands
I hope they find me in my home with my guitar in my hands

Whoa, oh
Whoa, oh

[Verse 2: Lee Amos]
A part of dawn to be ashamed of
But good people are supposed to be up
But I found peace with the path I took
As I lay down my head
Crossroads you got to choose
Which way do we win or lose
But every bone in my soul says I sing on through

[Bridge: Amos Lee]
Because I believe that I
Was born with a song inside of me
Never question why
I just kept on chasing that melody
And as time goes by
It is funny how time can make you realize
We are running out of it

[Chorus: Zac Brown & Amos Lee]
On the day that I die
I want to say that I
Was a man who really lived and never compromised
And when I have lived out my days
Until the very end
I hope they find me in my home, a guitar in my hands
I hope they find me in my home with my guitar in my hands

Whoa, oh
Whoa, oh

[Verse 1]
Can anybody here pass me a beer
And I might keep playing this music that you hear
And if you know the song
Then come and sing along with me

Walking with the beach to my left
Sea to my right
And I might get faded at the Tiki bar tonight
Then I might roll one up
Like my name is Bob
Yeah, I am going to party like I am a Jamaican

[Chorus]
If you really want to know where you can find me
I will be unwinding
Down in the islands, down in the islands
You should loose track of your timing
Grab a drink beside me
Down in the islands, down in the islands

[Verse 2]
Can anybody here pass me the rum
And we can find somebody who can play the steel drums
And if you like this beat then everybody dance with me
We got the ladies to the left
Fellas, to the right
And everybody's faded at the Tiki bar tonight
And we are going to dance to the rhythm of the waves
While we drink Bacardi by the bonfire flames

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
You do not need no invitation, no
Whoa!
If you are looking for relaxation
Get away, get away with me
Make your destination my location

[Chorus]

[Chorus]
Amarillo by morning, up from San Antone
Everything that I've got is just what I've got on
When that sun is high in that Texas sky
I'll be bucking at the county fair
Amarillo by morning, Amarillo I'll be there

[Bridge]
They took my saddle in Houston, broke my leg in Santa Fe
Lost my wife and a girlfriend somewhere along the way
Well I'll be looking for eight when they pull that gate
And I hope that judge ain't blind
Amarillo by morning, Amarillo's on my mind

[Chorus]
Amarillo by morning, up from San Antone
Everything that I've got is just what I've got on
I ain't got a dime, but what I got is mine
I ain't rich, but Lord I'm free
Amarillo by morning, Amarillo's where I'll be
Amarillo by morning, Amarillo's where I'll be

[Verse 1]
I am not gonna lay around and whine and moan for somebody that done me wrong
Don't think for a minute that I am gonna sit around and sing some old sad song
I believe it's half full not a half empty glass
Every day I wake up knowing it could be my last

[Chorus]
I ain't here for a long time
I'm here for a good time
So bring on the sunshine, to hell with the red wine
Pour me some moonshine
When I'm gone put it in stone "He left nothing behind"
I ain't here for a long time
I'm here for a good time

[Verse 2]
Folks are always dreaming about what they like to do but I like to do just what I like
I take the chance, dance the dance, it might be wrong but then again it might be right
There's no way of knowing what tomorrow brings
Life's too short to waste it I say bring on anything

[Chorus]
I ain't here for a long time
I'm here for a good time
So bring on the sunshine, to hell with the red wine
Pour me some moonshine
When I'm gone put it in stone "He left nothing behind"
I ain't here for a long time
I'm here for a good time
I ain't here for a long time
I'm here for a good time

[Verse 1]
Just walked down the street to the coffee shop
Had to take a break
I've been by her side for eighteen hours straight
Saw a flower growing in the middle of the sidewalk
Pushing up through the concrete
Like it was planted right there for me to see

The flashing lights
The honking horns
All seem to fade away
But in the shadow of the hospital
At 5:08
I saw God today

[Chorus]
I've been to church
I've read the book
I know He's there
But I don't look
Near as often as I should

His fingerprints are everywhere
I just look down and stop and stare
Open my eyes and then I swear
I Saw God Today

[Verse 2]
Saw a couple walking by
They were holding hands
And she had that glow
Yeah, I couldn't help
But I noticed that she was starting to show
Stood there for a minute
Taking in the sky
Lost in that sunset
A splash of amber melting into shades of red

[Chorus]
I've been to church
I've read the book
I know He's there
But I don't look
Near as often as I should

[Verse 3]
Got my face pushed up against the nursery glass
She's sleeping like a rock
My name on her wrist
Wearing tiny pink socks
She's got my nose
She's got her Mama's eyes
My brand new baby girl
She's a miracle
I Saw God Today

[Verse 1]
It started way back in third grade
I used to sit beside Emmylou Hayes
A pink dress, a matching bow and her pony tail
She kissed me on the school bus, but told me not to tell

[Verse 2]
Next day I chased her 'round the playground
Across the monkey bars, to the merry-go-round
And Emmylou got caught passing me a note
Before the teacher took it, I read what she wrote

[Chorus]
"Do you love me, do you wanna be my friend?
And if you do
Well then don't be afraid to take me by the hand
If you want to
I think this is how love goes, check yes or no"

[Verse 3]
Now we're grown up and she's my wife
Still like two kids with stars in our eyes
Ain't much changed, I still chase Emmylou
Up and down the hall, around the bed in our room

[Verse 4]
Last night I took her out in a white limousine
Twenty years together, she still gets to me
Can't believe it's been that long ago
When we got started with just a little note

[Chorus]
"Do you love me, do you wanna be my friend?
And if you do
Well then don't be afraid to take me by the hand
If you want to
I think this is how love goes, check yes or no"

[Chorus]
"Do you love me, do you wanna be my friend?
And if you do
Well then don't be afraid to take me by the hand
If you want to
I think this is how love goes, check yes or no"

[Outro]
Check yes or no
Check yes or no
Check yes or no
Check yes or no

[Verse 1]
Our love is unconditional, we knew it from the start
I see it in your eyes, you can feel it from my heart
From here on after let's stay the way we are right now
And share all the love and laughter that a lifetime will allow

[Chorus]
I cross my heart and promise to
Give all I've got to give to make all your dreams come true
In all the world you'll never find
A love as true as mine

[Verse 2]
You will always be the miracle that makes my life complete
And as long as there's a breath in me, I'll make yours just as sweet
As we look into the future, it's as far as we can see
So let's make each tomorrow be the best that it can be

[Chorus]
I cross my heart and promise to
Give all I've got to give to make all your dreams come true
In all the world you'll never find
A love as true as mine

[Bridge]
And if along the way we find a day it starts to storm
You've got the promise of my love to keep you warm

[Outro]
In all the world you'll never find
A love as true as mine
A love as true as mine

[Intro]
Jingle Bell, Jingle Bell, Jingle Bell Rock
Jingle bell swing and jingle bells ring
Snowing and blowing up bushels of fun
Now the jingle hop has begun

Jingle Bell, Jingle Bell, Jingle Bell Rock
Jingle bells chime in jingle bell time
Dancing and prancing in Jingle Bell Square
In the frosty air

[Verse]
What a bright time, it's the right time
To rock the night away
Jingle bell time is a swell time
To go gliding in a one-horse sleigh

[Outro]
Giddy-up jingle horse, pick up your feet
Jingle around the clock
Mix and a-mingle in the jingling feet
That's the jingle bell
That's the jingle bell
That's the jingle bell rock

[Verse 1]
Whiskey is the gasoline that lights the fire that burns the bridge
Ice creates the water that's no longer runnin' under it
Stool holds the fool that pours the whiskey on his broken heart
Cigarettes create the smoke that hides the lonesome in his eyes
The jukebox plays Hank, "I'm So Lonesome I Could Cry"
Dance floor holds the folks trying to forget who they are
And that's what happens in every little honky tonk bar

[Chorus]
Friday night, it's a given
I'll be L-I-V-N, livin'
We'll dance on the bar 'til we're sleeping it off in the car
Monday morning, it's a given
I'll be D-R-A-G-N, draggin'
And that's what happens in every little honky tonk bar

[Verse 2]
Neon lights flashing bright 'til you're almost hypnotized
Waitress, short skirt, gets hit on by every guy
Comin' and goin', always rollin' with the flow
Bartender, pour our drinks; Código, do a shot
You think you're tall and bulletproof
Until somebody says you're not
You step outside thinkin' you're gonna show 'em you are
And that's what happens in every little honky tonk bar

[Chorus]
Friday night, it's a given
We'll be L-I-V-N, livin'
We'll dance on the bar 'til we're sleeping it off in the car
Monday morning, it's a given
We'll be D-R-A-G-N, draggin'
And that's what happens in every little honky tonk bar
Yeah, that's what happens in every little honky tonk bar

[Outro]
Whiskey is the gasoline that lights the fire that burns the bridge

[Verse 1]
She was leaning on a rail in a cotton dress
Summer tanned pretty, little perfect mess
With a story that could only be anybody's guess
And I was thinking that I probably didn't stand a chance
But I rolled up my sleeves, walked up and I said
Hey, I know I don't know you but I'd kinda like a shot
She said, I saw you coming over, I already thought it over
And okay, so now what

[Chorus]
And I said, well I got a car, she said, there's something
At least it's a start, I said, it's better than nothing
I ain't in no hurry but I'm ready when you are
And she said, where do you think all this is going
I said, there ain't no way of knowing
I guess I hadn't thought it through that far
But I got a car

[Verse 2]
So, we let the wheels turn and the windows down
We let ourselves go all the way through town
She never said stop and I never asked her why
We drove into the night, when outta nowhere
She said, I'd give anything to never go back there
And I kinda wish this day would never end
She said, I could use a change but I don't even know where to begin

[Chorus]
And I said, well I got a car, she said, there's something
At least it's a start, I said, it's better than nothing
I ain't in no hurry but I'm ready when you are
And she said, where do you think all this is going
I said, there ain't no way of knowing
I really hadn't thought it through that far
I can't promise you the moon and stars
But I got a car

[Verse 3]
We got lost in the miles, lost track of the days
'Til we finally found a stopping place
When the doctor said, you know what's on the way
And we found ourselves in a little white house
One Sunday morning, rain pouring down
She said, I think it's time but all the lines are out

[Verse 4]
And her eyes teared up and she said, what are we gonna do now
And I said, well I got a car, she said, there's something
You think it'll start, I said, it's already running
Got your things in the back and I'm ready when you are
She said, are you sure it'll get us where we're going
I said, if there's one thing I know girl, it's gotten us this far
And I don't mean to hurry but I'm ready when you are

[Verse 1]
I still feel 25 most of the time
I still raise a little Cain with the boys
Honky Tonks and pretty women
But Lord I'm still right there with'em
Singing above the crowd and the noise

[Chorus]
Sometimes I feel like Jesse James
Still trying to make a name
Knowing nothing's gonna change what I am
I was a young troubador
When I wrote in on a song
And I'll be an old troubador when I'm gone

[Verse 2]
Well the truth about a mirror
Is that a damn old mirror
Don't really tell the whole truth
It don't show what's deep inside
Or read between the lines
And it's really no reflection of my youth

[Chorus]

[Outro]
I was a young troubador
When I wrote in on a song
And I'll be an old troubador when I'm gone
I'll be an old troubador when I'm gone

[Verse 1]
She was storming through the house that day
And I could tell she was leaving
And I thought, aw, she'll be back
Till she turned around and pointed at the wall and said

[Verse 2]
That picture from our honeymoon
That night in Frisco Bay
Just give it away
She said, give it away
And that big four-poster king-size bed
Where so much love was made
Just give it away
She said, just give it away

[Chorus]
Just give it away
There ain't nothing in this house worth fighting over
Oh, and we're both tired of fighting anyway
Just give it away

[Bridge]
So I tried to move on
But I found that each woman I held
Just reminded me of that day
Hmm

[Verse 3]
When that front door swung wide open
She flung her diamond ring
Said, give it away
Just give it away
And I said, now, honey, don't you even want
Your half of everything
She said, give it away
Just give it away

[Chorus]
Just give it away
There ain't nothing in this house worth fighting over
Oh, and we're both tired of fighting anyway
Just give it away

[Instrumental interlude]

[Verse 4]
So I'm still right here where she left me
Along with all the other things
She don't care about anymore
Mmm, like that picture from our honeymoon
That night in Frisco Bay
She said, give it away
Well, I can't give it away
And that big four-poster king-size bed
Where all our love was made
She said, give it away
Well, I can't give it away

[Outro]
I've got a furnished house, a diamond ring
And a lonely broken heart
Full of love and I can't even give it away

[Verse 1]
If you leave me, I won't miss you
And I won't ever take you back
Girl, your memory won't ever haunt me
Cause I don't love you, and now if you'll buy that

[Chorus]
I got some ocean front property in Arizona
From my front porch you can see the sea
I got some ocean front property in Arizona
If you'll buy that, I'll throw the golden gate in free

[Verse 2]
I don't worship the ground you walk on
I never have and that's a fact
I won't follow or try to find you
Cause I don't love you, and now if you'll buy that

[Chorus]

[Outro]
Yeah, if you'll buy that I'll throw the golden gate in free

[Verse 1]
I got sent home from school one day with a shiner on my eye
Fighting was against the rules and it didn’t matter why
When Dad got home I told that story just like I’d rehearsed
Then stood there on those trembling knees
And waited for the worst

[Chrous]
And he said, “Let me tell you a secret, about a father’s love
A secret that my daddy said was just between us
He said daddies don’t just love their children
Every now and then
It’s a love without end, amen, it’s a love without end, amen”

[Verse 2]
When I became a father in the spring of ‘81
There was no doubt that stubborn boy
Was just like my father’s son
And when I thought my patience had been tested to the end
I took my daddy’s secret and I passed it on to him

[Chrous]
And I said, “Let me tell you a secret, about a father’s love
A secret that my daddy said was just between us
I said daddies don’t just love their children every now and then
It’s a love without end, amen, it’s a love without end, amen”

[Bridge]

Last night I dreamed I’d died and
Stood outside those pearly gates
When suddenly I realized there must be some mistake
If they know half the stuff I done they’ll never let me in
Then somewhere from the other side I heard these words again

[Chorus]
And they said, “Let me tell you a secret, about a father’s love
A secret that my daddy said was just between us
You see, daddies don’t just love their children
Every now and then
It’s a love without end, amen, it’s a love without end, amen"

[Verse 1]
God and country music
Like whiskey and a prayer
Like Johnny Cash's arm 'round Billy Graham
God and country music
They both never really change
You find 'em when you need 'em where you stand

[Chorus]
There's always lost in the found
And darkness in the "I saw the light"
It's livin' in those small towns
In some church or backroad honky-tonk tonight
It's a dance between the sin and the salvation
Come hell or high water, there's two things still worth savin'
God and country music
God and country music

[Verse 2]
God and country music
They both show you the truth
They've seen the low of the valley
And the highs of the mountains, too
Folded hands and guitar strings
Jukebox preachers and angels sing
Call you like they knew ya
Between the hell and hallelujah

[Chorus]
There's always lost in the found
And darkness in the "I saw the light"
It's still livin' in those small towns
In some church or backroad honky-tonk tonight
It's a dance between the sin and the salvation
Come hell or high water, there's two things still worth savin'
God and country music
God and country music

[Chorus]
There's always lost in the found
And darkness in the "I saw the light"
It's still livin' in those small towns
In some church or backroad honky-tonk tonight
It's a dance between the sin and the salvation
Come hell or high water, there's two things still worth savin'
God and country music
God and country music
God and country music
God and country music

[Verse 1]
Well, excuse me
But I think you've got my chair
No, that one is not taken
I don't mind if you sit here, I'll be glad to share

Yeah, it's usually packed here on Friday nights
Oh, if you don't mind, could I talk you out of a light?

[Verse 2]
Well, thank you, could I drink you a buy?
Oh, listen to me, what I mean is can I buy you a drink?
Anything you please

Oh, you're welcome, well, I don't think I caught your name
Are you waiting for someone to meet you here?
Well, that makes two of us, glad you came

[Verse 3]
No, I don't know the name of the band, but they're good
Aren't they, would you like to dance?
Yeah, I like this song too, it reminds me of you and me
Baby, do you think there is a chance

That later on I could drive you home?
No, I do not mind at all
Oh, I like you too, and to tell you the truth
That was not my chair after all
Oh, I like you too, and to tell you the truth
That was not my chair after all

[Verse 1]
I don't want to be the kind to hesitate
Be too shy, wait too late
I don't care what they say other lovers do
I just want to dance with you

[Verse 2]
I gotta feeling that you have a heart like mine
So let it show, let it shine
If we have a chance to make one heart of two
I just want to dance with you

[Chorus]
I want to dance with you, twirl you all around the floor
That's what they intended dancing for
I just want to dance with you
I want to dance with you, hold you in my arms once more
That's what they invented dancing for
I just want to dance with you

[Verse 3]
I caught you looking at me when I looked at you
Yes I did, ain't that true?
You won't get embarrassed by the things I do
I just want to dance with you

[Verse 4]
Oh the boys are playing softly and the girls are too
So am I and so are you
If this was a movie, we'd be right on cue
I just want to dance with you

[Chorus]
I want to dance with you, twirl you all around the floor
That's what they intended dancing for
I just want to dance with you
I want to dance with you, hold you in my arms once more
That's what they invented dancing for
I just want to dance with you

[Outro]
I just want to dance with you
I just want to dance with you
I just want to dance with you

[Verse 1]
I never saw the end in sight
Fools are kind of blind
Thought everything was going alright
But I was running out of time

'Cause you had one foot out the door
I swear I didn't see
But if you're really going away
Here's some final words from me

[Chorus]
Baby, write this down, take a little note
To remind you in case you didn't know
Tell yourself I love you and I don't want you to go
Write this down

Take my words and read them every day
Keep them close by, don't you let them fade away
So you'll remember what I forgot to say
Write this down

[Verse 2]
I'll sign it at the bottom of the page
I'll swear under oath
Cause every single word is true
And I think you need to know

So use it as a bookmark
Stick it on your refrigerator door
Hang it in a picture frame up above the mantel
Where you'll see it for sure

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
You can find a chisel, I can find a stone
Folks will be reading these words long after we're gone

[Chorus]

Oh, I love you and I don't want you to go
Baby, write this down

[Verse 1]
Her telephone rang 'bout a quarter to nine
She heard his voice on the other end of the line
She wondered what was wrong this time
She never knew what his calls might bring
With a cowboy like him it could be anything
And she always expected the worst in the back of her mind

[Verse 2]
He said, "It's cold out here and I'm all alone
I didn't make the short go again and I'm coming home
I know I've been away too long
I never got a chance to write or call
And I know this rodeo has been hard on us all
But I'll be home soon and honey is there something wrong?"

[Chorus:]
She said, "Don't bother coming home
By the time you get here I'll be long gone
There's somebody new and he sure ain't no rodeo man."
He said, "I'm sorry it's come down to this
There's so much about you that I'm gonna miss
But it's alright baby, if I hurry I can still make Cheyenne
Gotta go now baby, if I hurry I can still make Cheyenne

[Verse 3]
He left that phone dangling off the hook
Then slowly turned around and gave it one last look
Then he just walked away
He aimed his truck toward that Wyoming line
With a little luck he could still get there in time
And in that Cheyenne wind he could still hear her say

[Chorus:]
She said, "Don't bother coming home
By the time you get here I'll be long gone
There's somebody new and he sure ain't no rodeo man."
He said, "I'm sorry it's come down to this
There's so much about you that I'm gonna miss
But it's alright baby, if I hurry I can still make Cheyenne
Gotta go now baby, if I hurry I can still make Cheyenne

[Verse 1]
Baby all I got is this beat up leather bag
And everything I own don't fill up half
But don't you worry about the way I pack
All I care about is getting back real soon
A goodbye kiss is all I need from you

[Chorus]
'Cause I'm carrying your love with me
West Virginia down to Tennessee
I'll be moving with the good Lord's speed
Carrying your love with me

It's my strength for holding on
Every minute that I have to be gone
I'll have everything I ever need
Carrying your love with me

[Verse 2]
On a lonely highway, stuck out in the rain
Darling all I have to do is speak your name
The clouds roll back and the waters part
The sun starts shining in my heart for you
You're right there in everything I do

[Chorus]
'Cause I'm carrying your love with me
West Virginia down to Tennessee
I'll be moving with the good Lord's speed
Carrying your love with me

It's my strength for holding on
Every minute that I have to be gone
I'll have everything I'll ever need
I'm carrying your love with me

I'm carrying your love with me
West Virginia down to Tennessee
I'll be moving with the good Lord's speed
Carrying your love with me

[Verse 1]
I didn't have to turn my head whenever you walked in
The only one to let these chills roll down my skin
My heart beats faster, I hear your name
I feel my confidence slippin' away

[Chorus]
I thought I was doing fine
'Bout to get you off my mind
I see your face and then I'm
Wrapped around your pretty little finger again

[Verse 2]
It feels like ages since you laid down in my arms
I see no good reason but still I'm tangled in your charms
My God, you're smiling and you catch my eye
My heart is pounding deep inside

[Chorus]
I thought I was doing fine
'Bout to get you off my mind
I see your face and then I'm
Wrapped around your pretty little finger again

[Verse 3]
Ain't gonna let no man go down without a fight
'Cause my stalls and walls look better in the bright daylight
My heart beats faster, I call your name
I feel my confidence slippin' away

[Chorus]
I thought I was doing fine
'Bout to get you off my mind
I see your face and then I'm
Wrapped around your pretty little finger again

[Outro]
Your pretty little finger
Baby, I'm wrapped around your pretty little finger
Pretty little finger

If there's a plane or a bus leaving Dallas
I hope you're on it
If there's a train moving fast down the tracks
I hope you caught it

Cause I swear out there ain't where you ought to be
So catch a ride, catch a cab
Don't you know I miss you bad
But don't you walk to me

Baby run, cut a path across the blue skies
Straight in a straight line
You can't get here fast enough

Find a truck and fire it up
Lean on the gas and off the clutch
Leave Dallas in the dust
I need you in a rush
So baby run

If you ain't got a suit case
Get a box or an old brown paper sack
And pack it light or pack it heavy
Take a truck, take a Chevy
Baby just come back

There's a shortcut to the highway out of town
Why don't you take it
Don't let that speed limit slow you down
Go on and break it

Baby run
Oh baby run
Baby run

[Verse 1]
I don't take my whiskey to extremes
Don't believe in chasing crazy dreams
My feet are planted firmly on the ground
But darling when you come around

[Chorus]
I get carried away by the look by the light in your eyes
Before I even realize the ride I'm on baby I'm long gone
I get carried away nothing matters but being with you
Like a feather flying high up in the sky on a windy day, I get carried away

[Verse 2]
It might seem like an ordinary night
Same ol' stars, the same ol' moon up high
But when I see you standing at your door
Nothing's ordinary anymore

[Chorus]
I get carried away by the look by the light in your eyes
Before I even realize the ride I'm on baby I'm long gone
I get carried away nothing matters but being with you
Like a feather flying high up in the sky on a windy day, I get carried away

[Chorus]
I get carried away by the look by the light in your eyes
Before I even realize the ride I'm on baby I'm long gone
I get carried away nothing matters but being with you
Like a feather flying high up in the sky on a windy day, I get carried away

Carried away

[Verse 1]
July moonlight shines
Your pretty little head on my shoulder
Pull over on the side of the road
Oh my God, you're something
Like nothing I've ever seen
If I'm asleep girl, let me dream

[Chorus]
Baby fall into my kiss
It should just happen like this
Trust it so much that there's no one else but us and
This moment that says it's so right
Cause that's all we have in this life
Drink up this love, baby, give it all we got tonight

[Verse 2]
Summer honeysuckle
Leaking through a rolled down window
We both know when that seat lays back
Anything can happen
So imagine it'll never end
Just close your eyes and you can see that we are where we're meant to be

[Chorus]
Baby fall into my kiss
It should just happen like this
Trust it so much that there's no one else but us and
This moment that says it's so right
Cause that's all we have in this life
Drink up this love, baby, give it all we got tonight

[Verse 1]
It's gonna be a long one, another grave yard shift
As he says goodbye to his wife and kids
He spends his life just like his dad's
Driving away under the weight of the badge

[Verse 2]
He's seen it all in his fifteen years
Watchin' our backs, facing our fears
Lord knows it ain't no easy task
Keeping us safe under the weight of the badge

[Verse 3]
He swore that oath to protect and serve
Pours his heart and soul into both those words
Lays his life on the line
And the line he walks is razor-fine
Tempered strength is always tough
But he ain't gonna buckle under the weight of the badge

[Verse 4]
Not that long ago, he woke up in the hospital
With his wife and kids praying by his bed
He said, "I'm gonna be alright
There's just some times you gotta fight"
And the truth is, nothing truer could be said
I do it for us and I do it for them
And I ain't gonna buckle under the weight of the badge

[Verse 5]
It doesn't weigh a lot until you put it on
And the weight of it is staggering
Then duty calls each time
He knows he's gotta answer
And it's all in the hand of
The heavy weight of the badge
And he ain't gonna buckle
Under the weight of the badge
No, he ain't gonna buckle
Under the weight of the badge

[Verse 1]
You know Dasher and Dancer, and Prancer and Vixen
Comet and Cupid, and Donner and Blitzen
But do you recall, the most famous reindeer of all?

[Verse 2]
Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer
Had a very shiny nose
And if you ever saw it
You could even say it glows

[Verse 3]
All of the other reindeer
Used to laugh and call him names
They never let poor Rudolph
Join in any reindeer games

[Verse 4]
Then one foggy Christmas Eve
Santa came to say
"Rudolph with your nose so bright
Won't you guide my sleigh tonight?"
Then how the reindeer loved him
As they shouted out with glee
"Rudolph the red-nosed Reindeer
You'll go down in history"

[Verse 1]
I knew the stakes were high right from the start
When she dealt the cards, I bet my heart
Now I just found a game that I can't play
And this is where the cowboy rides away

[Chorus]
And my heart is sinking like the setting sun
Setting on the things I wish I'd done
It's time to say goodbye to yesterday
This is where the cowboy rides away

[Verse 2]
We've been in and out of love and in-between
And now we play the final showdown scene
As the credits roll, a sad song starts to play
And this is where the cowboy rides away

[Chorus]
And my heart is sinking like the setting sun
Setting on the things I wish I'd done
Oh, the last goodbye's the hardest one to say
This is where the cowboy rides away

[Outro]
Oh, the last goodbye's the hardest one to say
This is where the cowboy rides away

[Verse 1]
Frosty the snowman was a jolly happy soul
With a corn cob pipe and a buttoned nose
And two eyes made out of coal

[Verse 2]
Frosty the snowman is a fairy tale they say
He was made of snow, but the children know
How he came to life one day

[Verse 3]
There must have been some magic
In that old silk hat they found
For when they placed it on his head
He began to dance around

[Verse 4]
Frosty the snowman was alive as he could be
And the children say he could laugh and play
Just the same as you and me
Frosty the snowman knew the sun was hot that day
So he said, "Let us run and have some fun now, before I melt away"

[Verse 5]
Down to the village, with a broomstick in his hand
Running here and there all around the square
Saying, "Catch me if you can"

[Verse 6]
He led them down the streets of town right to the traffic car
And he only paused a moment when he heard them holler, "Stop"
For Frosty the snowman had to hurry on his way
But he waived goodbye, saying, "Please do not cry, I will be back again some day"

[Verse 1]
Oh the weather outside is frightful
But the fire is so delightful
And since we've no place to go
Let It Snow! Let It Snow! Let It Snow!

It doesn't shows of stopping
And I've brought some corn for popping

The lights are turned way down low
Let It Snow! Let It Snow! Let It Snow!

[Verse 2]
When we finally kiss goodnight
How I'll hate going out in the storm!
But if you'll really hold me tight
All the way home I'll be warm

[Verse 3]
The fire is slowly dying
And, my dear, we're still goodbying
But as long as you love me so
Let It Snow! Let It Snow! Let It Snow!

[Verse 1]
I got sent home from school one day with a shiner on my eye
Fighting was against the rules and it didn't matter why
When dad got home I told that story just like I'd rehearsed
And then stood there on those trembling knees and waited for the worst

And he said, "Let me tell you a secret about a father's love
A secret that my daddy said was just between us”
He said, "Daddies don't just love their children every now and then
It's a love without end, amen, it's a love without end, amen"

[Verse 2]
When I became a father in the spring of '81
There was no doubt that stubborn boy was just like my father's son
And when I thought my patience had been tested to the end
I took my daddy's secret and I passed it on to him

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Last night I dreamed I died and stood outside those pearly gates
When suddenly I realized there must be some mistake
If they know half the things I've done, they'll never let me in
And then somewhere from the other side I heard these words again

[Chorus]

[Verse 1]
Oh, how you sparkle
And oh, how you shine
That flush on your cheeks is more than the wine
And he must do something that I didn't do
Whatever he's doing
It looks good on you

[Chorus]
You look so good in love
You want him
That's easy to see
You look so good in love
And I wish you still wanted me

[Verse 2]
He must have stolen some stars from the sky
And gave them to you to wear in your eyes
I had my chances
But I set you free
And now I wonder why I couldn't see

[Chorus]
You look so good in love
You want him
That's easy to see
You look so good in love
And I wish you still wanted me

[Verse 3]
Darling, I've wasted a lot of years not seeing the real you
But tonight your beauty is shining through
And I never took the time to let you know
So before he takes you away
Please let me say

[Chorus]
You look so good in love
You want him
That's easy to see
You look so good in love
And I wish you still wanted me

[Outro]
You look so good in love

[Verse 1]
I can see you're fallin' for her
Friend you know she once was mine
So I guess I oughta warn you
'Cause you're showin' all the signs

[Chorus]
She's a devil; she's an angel
She's a woman; she's a child
She's a heartache when she leaves you
But she'll leave you with a smile

[Verse 2]
When she held me it was Heaven
It was worth the losin' pain
And when she's gone she'll leave you wishin'
She'd just roll your way again

[Chorus]
She's a devil; she's an angel
She's a woman; she's a child
She's a heartache when she leaves you
But she'll leave you with a smile

[Refrain]
Yeah, she's a devil (she's a devil)
She's an angel (she's an angel)
She's a woman; she's a child
She's a heartache when she leaves you
But she'll leave you with a smile

Says she's had enough of me
I've had enough of her too
I might as well go on and set her free
She's already turned me loose

No fault, no blame, nobody done no wrong
That's just the way it sometimes goes
Sometimes two people just don't get along
It's time to hit the road

[Chorus]
Goodbye, farewell, so long
Vaya con Dios, good luck
Wish you well, take it slow
Easy come girl, easy go

We tried to work it out a hundred times
Ninety-nine it didn't work
I think it's best we put it all behind
Before we wind up getting hurt

No hard feelings darling, no regrets
No tears and no broken hearts
Call it quits, calling off all bets
It just wasn't in the cards

[Chorus]

Easy come girl, easy go
Vaya condios, good luck
Easy come, easy go

[Pre-Chorus]
At first she's going to come on strong
Like she'll love you all night long
Like it's going out of style
Then she'll leave you with a smile

[Chorus]
Well you can't help but wonder
Why you can't help but love her
But you can't help love her
And all that hurting was more than worth it
It's written all over your face

[Verse 1]
One day you'll pass her on the street
With that guy you used to be
She'll say hello and walk on by
Then she'll leave you with a smile

[Chorus]
Well you can't help but wonder
Why you can't help but love her
But you can't help love her
And all that hurting was more than worth it
It's written all over your face

[Pre-Chorus]
At first she's going to come on strong
Like she'll love you all night long
Like it's going out of style
Then she'll leave you with a smile

[Outro]
Ah, she's going to love you
She going to leave you with a smile
Ah, she's going to love you
She going to leave you with a smile

[Chorus]
Well, they call me the fireman - that's my name
Making my rounds all over town putting out old flames
Hell, everybody'd like to have a what I got
I can cool 'em down when they're smoldering hot
I'm the fireman - that's my name

[Verse 1]
Last night they had a bad one a mile or two down the road
My buddy walked out and left his woman burning out of control
Well, I was down there in about an hour or so
With a little mouth to mouth. she was ready to go
I'm the fireman - that's my name

[Chorus]
Well, they call me the fireman - that's my name
Making my rounds all over town putting out old flames
Hell, everybody'd like to have a what I got
I can cool 'em down when they're smoldering hot
I'm the fireman - that's my name

[Verse 2]
Got a fire engine red T-bird automobile
In a minute or less I can be dressed fit to kill
I work twenty-four on, twenty-four off
When they get too hot, they just give me a call
I'm the fireman - that's my name

[Chorus]
Well, they call me the fireman - that's my name
Making my rounds all over town putting out old flames
Hell, everybody'd like to have a what I got
I can cool 'em down when they're smoldering hot
I'm the fireman - that's my name

[Verse 1]
She looked so much like a lady, but she was so much like a child
A devil when she held me close, an angel when she smiled
She always held it deep inside, but somehow I always knew
She's go away when the grass turned green and the sky turned baby blue

[Chorus]
And baby blue was the color of her eyes
Baby blue like the Colorado skies
Like a breath of spring, she came and left
And I still don't know why
So here's to you and whoever holds my baby blue tonight

[Verse 2]
She brought colors to my life that my eyes had never touched
And when she taught me how to care, I never cared so much
I try not to think of her, but I fall asleep and do
And drift off where the grass is green and the sky is baby blue

[Chorus]
And baby blue was the color of her eyes
Baby blue like the Colorado skies
Like a breath of spring, she came and left
And I still don't know why
So here's to you and whoever holds my baby blue tonight

Baby blue was the color of her eyes
Baby blue like the Colorado skies
Like a breath of spring, she came and left
And I still don't know why
So here's to you and whoever holds my baby blue tonight

[Outro]
Baby blue was the color of her eyes
Baby blue like the Colorado skies
Baby blue was the color of her eyes
Baby blue like the Colorado skies
Baby blue was the color of her eyes
Baby blue like the Colorado skies
Baby blue

[Verse 1]
Cold Fort Worth beer just ain't no good for jealous
I tried it night after night
You're in someone else's arms in Dallas
Does Fort Worth ever cross your mind?

[Verse 2]
Darling, while you're busy burning bridges
Burn one for me if you get time
Cause good memories don't fade so easy
Does Fort Worth ever cross you mind?

[Chorus]
You left me here to be with him in Dallas
And I know it hurt you at the time
But I wonder now if it makes a difference
Does Fort Worth ever cross your mind?

[Chorus]
You left me here to be with him in Dallas
And I know it hurt you at the time
But I wonder now if it makes a difference
Does Fort Worth ever cross your mind?

[Outro]
Does Fort Worth ever?
Does Fort Worth ever?
Does Fort Worth ever cross your mind?

[Verse 1: George Strait]
Well, I've had a wonderful career
But I think it's quite queer
So I'm writin' this down in a song
I just couldn't resist
'Cause it's a nice little twist
And I think you'll agree this is just wrong

[Chorus: George Strait]
I ain't never got to sing one with Willie
And I've held it inside long enough
Now I ain't too proud, I'm gonna shout it out loud
I ain't never got to sing one with Willie

[Verse 2: George Strait]
Now I've heard him with Merle, Waylon, and Cash
Jones and Toby, that man is totally gracious
But I'm thinking "Damn, why not me?"
We could even sing it on TV
Just like him and old Julio Iglesias

[Chorus: George Strait]
I ain't never got to sing one with Willie
And I've held it inside long enough
Now I ain't too proud, I'm gonna shout it out loud
I ain't never got to sing one with Willie

[Verse 3: Willie Nelson & George Strait]
We've traveled back and forth
Up and down all the highways
Wherever our big buses can go
But I think that it's great
To finally sing one with Strait
And our friends will all love it, I know
(But I'm lovin' it, too, Willie)

[Chorus: Willie Nelson & George Strait]
I finally get to sing one with Strait
Well, I think that it's been long enough
I'm mighty proud, just listen to the crowd
I finally got to sing one with George Strait

[Verse 4: George Strait & Willie Nelson]
Look at me now, I'm singing with Willie
Thank you, man, you just made my career
Well, you shoulda said somethin', Strait
I always thought we would sound great
And I finally got to sing one with ol' George

[Outro: George Strait, Willie Nelson & Both]
Yeah, I am really proud
So I'm shoutin' it out loud
I finally got to sing one
With ol' George
With ol' Willie

[Verse 1]
She took off down the road
Towards Austin, and I lost it
I heard she wound up in Fort Worth
No, I ain't been the same since
My heart's as hard as that old Caliche dirt

[Chorus]
Some days are better than others
Some are mothers
I ain't even gonna lie
Some days, I don't wanna get up
I just wanna give up
And don't even get me started on some nights

[Verse 2]
I guess I could always call her, but why bother?
Hell, she won't pick up that phone
Got no pride left to swallow, so tomorrow
I'll try again to just move on

[Chorus]
Some days are better than others
Some are mothers
I ain't even gonna lie
Some days, I don't wanna get up
I just wanna give up
Don't even get me started on some nights

[Instrumental Bridge]

[Chorus]
Some days are better than others
Some are mothers
I ain't even gonna lie
Some days, I don't wanna get up
I just wanna give up
And don't even get me started
Some days are better than others
Some are mothers
I ain't even gonna lie
Some days, I don't wanna get up
I just wanna give up
And don't even get me started on some nights
Mmm, some nights

[Outro]
She took off down the road
Towards Austin, and I lost it

[Intro]
You better watch out
You better not cry
You better not pout, I am telling you why
Santa Claus is coming to town

[Verse 1]
He is making a list and checking it twice
Going to find out who is naughty or nice
Santa Claus is coming to town

[Verse 2]
He sees you when your sleeping
He knows when you are awake
He knows if you have been bad or good
So be good for goodness sake
Oh you better watch out
You better not cry
You better not put I am telling you why
Santa Claus is coming to town

[Verse 3]
With little tin horns
And little toy drums
Rutty toot, toots and rummy tum, tum
Santa Claus is coming to town

[Verse 4]
With curly head dogs to cuddle and hug
Elephants, ropes, and kitty card to
Santa Claus is coming to town

[Verse 5]
The kids and girl and boy land
Will have a jubilee
There going to fill the toy lad all around with Christmas trees

[Outro]
So you better watch out
You better not cry
You better not put I am telling you why
Santa Claus is coming
Santa Claus is coming to town

Right or wrong
I'll always love you
Oh, you're gone
I can't forget

Right or wrong
I'll keep on dreaming
Still I wake with that same ol' regret

All along I knew I'd lose you
Though I prayed that you'd be true
In your heart
Please just remember
Right or wrong
I'm still in love with you

Right or wrong
I'll always love you
Oh, you're gone
I can't forget

Right or wrong
I'll keep on dreaming
Still I wake with that same ol' regret

All along I knew I'd lose you
Though I prayed that you'd be true
In your heart
Please just remember
Right or wrong
I'm still in love with you

[Verse 1]
Baby, just like you
It's something new I just had to try
I didn't plan on it, but a sip and you'll want it
It's a beautiful high

[Pre-Chorus 1]
The perfect recipe
Baby, you and me
The secret's been found
Let's pour one right now

[Chorus]
I'm talkin' 'bout Código
I take it with me everywhere I go
Best tequila, baby, don't you know
A little sip and you're ready to roll
They make it down in Mexico
A little state called Jalisco
Where the beautiful agaves grow
I'm talkin' 'bout Código

[Verse 2]
Any way you like it
Any way you wanna try it, I'll try it too
I don't care if it's a habit
As long as you have it and I have it with you

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Hasta la Cruz
I'll be singing to you
All the way home
We'll make this our song

[Chorus]
I'm talkin' 'bout Código
I take it with me everywhere I go
Best tequila, baby, don't you know
A little sip and you're ready to roll
They make it down in Mexico
A little state called Jalisco
Where the beautiful agaves grow
I'm talkin' 'bout Código (Come on, boys)

[Bridge]
Straight up or on the rocks
Dressed up or not
Make it a surprise
Throw it back and close your eyes

[Chorus]
I'm talkin' 'bout Código
I take it with me everywhere I go
Best tequila, baby, don't you know
A little sip and you're ready to roll
They make it down in Mexico
A little state called Jalisco
Where the beautiful agaves grow
I'm talkin' 'bout Código
I'm talkin' 'bout Código
I take it with me everywhere I go
Best tequila, baby, don't you know
A little rip and you're ready to roll
They make 'em down in Mexico
A little state called Jalisco
Where the beautiful agaves grow
I'm talkin' 'bout Código
Where the beautiful agaves grow
I'm talkin' 'bout Código

[Verse 1]
Turn me on turn me off then you turn me back on by the weekend
And you won’t say the words that I want but you flirt when you’re drinkin’
I see those bubbles pop up like you’re texting then they disappear
Lets cut through the shit then let’s get to what we’re doing here

[Chorus]
Are we just a backseat, tryna get it while we can
Are we names in a tattoo, or just a number on a hand
Are we last call kissing or will we be reminiscing with each other for the next forty years
Are we written in the stars, baby, or are we written in the sand

[Verse 2]
Yeah, I want you to want me to take you back home to my mama
Put my name on your lips call me yours and forget all this drama
Your makeup is next to my toothbrush but you never put it away on the shelf
I'm asking you baby 'cause i’m tired of asking myself

[Chorus]
Are we just a backseat, tryna get it while we can
Are we names in a tattoo, or just a number on a hand
Are we last call kissing, are we dancing in the kitchen, baby tell me what it is or what it isn't
Are we written in the stars, baby, or are we written in the sand

[Outro]
Are we just a backseat, tryna get it while we can
Are we names in a tattoo, or just a number I should wash right off my hand
Are we last call kissing or will we be reminiscing with each other for the next forty years
Are we written in the stars baby, or are we written in the sand
Are we written in the stars baby, or are we written in the sand

[Intro]
Hey, hey
Keep your chin up
Hey, hey

[Verse 1]
I wonder if Jack and Diane ever made it
After the drums and the guitars all faded
Was the best they could do good enough?
Or did the heartland just swallow 'em up?
How did my mom and my dad ever do it?
If there was struggles, then we never knew it
I guess they had each other
That was enough

[Chorus]
You know you can't keep the ground from shaking
No matter how hard you try
You can't keep the sunsets from fading
You gotta treat your life like you're jumping off a rope swing
Baby 'cause the whole thing's really just a shot in the dark
You gotta love like there's no such thing as a broken heart
You gotta love like there's no such thing as a broken heart

[Verse 2]
What am I gonna tell my kids when they see all of this bullshit that goes down on TV?
When the whole world is down on its luck
I gotta make sure they keep their chin up
Cry when it hurts, laugh when it's funny
Chase after the dream, don't chase after the money
And know we got each other
That's what's up

[Chorus]
'Cause you can't keep the ground from shaking
No matter how hard you try
You can't keep the sunsets from fading
You gotta treat your life like you're jumping off a rope swing
Baby 'cause the whole thing's really just a shot in the dark
You gotta love like there's no such thing as a broken heart
You gotta love like there's no such thing as a broken heart

[Bridge]
You gotta love like there's no such thing as a broken heart

[Chorus]
'Cause you can't keep the ground from shaking
No matter how hard you try
You can't keep the sunsets from fading
You gotta treat your life like you're jumping off a rope swing
Baby 'cause the whole thing's really just a shot in the dark
You gotta love like there's no such thing as a broken heart
You gotta love, love, love, love, love (like there's no such thing)
You gotta love, love, love, love, love (as a broken heart)
You gotta love like there's no such thing as a broken heart

[Verse 1]
I know it's a drag, I know it's a grind
I know that a dollar ain't worth a dime
Just trying to keep up with the Joneses at the end of the block
I know you get tired, I know you get down
I know you get sick of this soul-sucking town
But let's make a little lemonade if lemons is all we got

[Chorus]
'Cause I'm stuck on you, you're stuck on me
I never gotta wonder where my honey be
I ain't savin' all my sugar for a Saturday night
Seven days a week I got an appetite
The sunset's like a tangerine, let's find a road we've never seen
Don't waste another mile or a minute not kissin' me
Life is short, make it sweet

[Verse 2]
Open sky, glimpse of heaven, take the top off the CJ-7
Let that surfside San Anne wind mess up your hair
And let that windshield frame the ocean
Radio keep coast-to-coastin'
If we don't get where we're going baby I don't care
I'm already there

[Chorus]
'Cause I'm stuck on you, you're stuck on me
I never gotta wonder where my honey be
I ain't savin' all my sugar for a Saturday night
Seven days a week I got an appetite
The sunset's like a tangerine, let's find a road we've never seen
Don't waste another mile or a minute not kissin' me
Life is short, make it sweet

[Bridge]
Days will be long but the years will fly right by
We'll never be as young as we are tonight
Baby ain't that right, yeah

[Chorus]
'Cause I'm stuck on you, you're stuck on me
I never gotta wonder where my honey be
I ain't savin' all my sugar for a Saturday night
Seven days a week I got an appetite
The sunset's like a tangerine, let's find a road we've never seen
Don't waste another mile or a minute not kissin' me
Life is short, make it sweet
Life is short, make it sweet
Oh yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah

[Verse 1]
Well, it was down some street we couldn't even pronounce
We were smoking a little from a half an ounce
The tequila was cheap but the flow we were feeling was real
Neither one of us looking for three little words
Unless those three words were "do not disturb"
Checkout was supposed to be noon but we slept in 'til three

[Chorus]
She kept the hotel key
Slipped it in her purse
I guess, it makes her think of me
And that night we left our hearts on our sleeves and the clothes all over the floor
We both know we can't open the door no more
She kept the hotel key

[Verse 2]
Well, I could still see her on the bed sitting Indian style
With my t-shirt on and a half drunk smile
She talked about Austin and how she'd get back there someday
We had the curtains wide open and a song on my phone
We danced by the TV we never turned on
And wondered would anyone miss us if we ran away?
But this isn't one of those stories that ends up that way, no

[Chorus]
She kept the hotel key
Slipped it in her purse
I guess, it makes her think of me
And that night we left our hearts on our sleeves and the clothes all over the floor
We both know we can't open the door no more
She kept the hotel key
Yeah

[Bridge]
We left the lights
We left the crowd
We left the world and locked it out
She left a picture in my head
She left the night I can't forget, but

[Chorus]
She kept the hotel key
Slipped it in her purse
I guess, it makes her think of me
And that night we left our hearts on our sleeves and the clothes all over the floor
We both know we can't open the door no more
She kept the hotel key
Yeah, she kept it
She kept the hotel key
Slipped it in her purse
I guess, it makes her think of me
And that night we left our hearts on our sleeves and the clothes all over the floor
We both know we can't open the door no more
She kept the hotel key

[Outro]
Yeah, she kept it
She kept the hotel key, ooh
She kept the hotel key

[Verse 1]
Right now we both know
We're Marina Del Ray
Planes gonna fly away
And you'll be on it
And by This Time Tomorrow
I'll be singing Yesterday
The sunshine's gonna fade
And we can't stop it
So before we turn in, I Can't Make You Love Me

[Chorus]
Let's be Brown Eyed Girl, Sweet Caroline
Freefallin' Small Town Saturday Night
Before you lose that loving feeling
Let's go Dancing on the Ceiling
Keep on living that Teenage Dream
Paradise City, where the grass is green
Pretty soon I'll be so lonesome I could cry
But that's a song for another time

[Verse 2]
Just for One More Day, What Do You Say?
Baby be my Pretty Woman
Because we know Sunday morning's coming down
Let's take a drive, you and I
Down some old country road
Talk about growing old in one of those Pink Houses
Yeah we might be a Candle in the Wind
But let's pretend we're

[Chorus]
Brown Eyed Girl sweet Caroline
Freefallin' small town Saturday night
Before you lose that loving feeling
Let's go dancing on the ceiling
Keep on living that teenage dream
Paradise city where the grass is green
Pretty soon you'll be always on my mind
But that's a song for another time

[Bridge]
So before we're singing I will always love you

[Chorus]
Let's sing brown eyed girl sweet Caroline
Freefallin' small town Saturday night
Before you lose that loving feeling
Let's go dancing on the ceiling
Keep on living that teenage dream
Paradise city where the grass is green
Pretty soon I'll be so lonesome I could cry
But that's a song for another time

[Outro]
Yeah that's a song for another time
(Brown eyed girl sweet Caroline)
Yeah, that's a song for another time
(Freefallin' small town Saturday night)
That's a song for another time

[Verse 1]
Hey girl, wassup
I know it's late but I knew you'd pick it up
Naw, I ain't drunk
Okay, maybe I do have a little buzz, but
That song came on and I just thought
What harm could come from one little call
I know you say you're taken but I say
Girl you're takin' too long

[Chorus]
To tell him that it's over
Then bring it on over
Stringing him along any longer girl
Is just wasting precious time
Girl you know it can't wait
Rip it off just like a Band-Aid
The way you look at me, girl, you can't pretend
I know you ain't in love with him
Break up with him

[Verse 2]
I know you don't wanna break his heart
But that ain't no good reason to be
Keeping us apart
Look, just tell him it's you, it ain't him
And maybe you can lie to him and say you'll
Still be friends
Whatever you got to say to get through to him
That you ain't in love
C'mon you can't deny that you and I
Kinda fit like a glove

[Chorus]
So tell him that it's over
Then bring it on over
Stringing him along any longer girl
Is just wasting precious time
Girl you know it can't wait
Rip it off just like a Band-Aid
It ain't my business to be all up in
But I know you ain't in love with him
Break up with him
I know that you so done with him
Break up with him, break up with him

[Verse 3]
You would've hung up by now
If you weren't thinking it too
No pressure whatever
Just do what you gotta do
But if I was you

[Chorus]
I'd tell him that it's over
Then bring it on over
Stringing him along any longer girl
Is just wasting precious time
Girl you know it can't wait
Just rip it off just like a Band-Aid
Yeah, I know I said it but I'll say it again
I know you ain't in love with him
Break up with him
The way you look at me girl you can't pretend
I know you ain't in love with him
Break up with him
Just break up with him

[Verse 1]
Strictly outta curiosity
What would happen if you got with me?
Kissin' you would hit the spot with me
Come on skip a couple rocks with me

[Pre-Chorus]
Give me any of your heart tonight
Ain't no reason that we need to be apart tonight
I got something we can start tonight
Lookin' at you girl, it's hard to fight

[Chorus]
Those stars need to be wished on
Your skin needs to be kissed on
My eyes baby, they're fixed on you
In your snapback
T-shirt of your favourite rock band
Checkin' your makeup in my Ray Bans
Breakin' hearts like only you can
In your snapback
Woah-oh-oh-oh
Woah-oh-oh-oh
Woah-oh-oh-oh
In your snapback

[Verse 2]
Come on baby, shoot a smile at me
Midnight selfie on a balcony
A little somethin' for my life screamin'
You're burnin' a hole in my pocket
And we've got the beat, let's drop it

[Chorus]
Those stars need to be wished on
Your skin needs to be kissed on
My eyes baby, they're fixed on you
In your snapback
Tattoos, cut-offs, and converse
Singin' along to the song with the wrong words
Every move you make baby it works
In your snapback
Woah-oh-oh-oh
Woah-oh-oh-oh
Woah-oh-oh-oh
In your snapback

[Chorus]
Those stars need to be wished on
Your skin needs to be kissed on
My eyes baby, they're fixed on you
In your snapback
T-shirt of your favourite rock band
Checkin' your makeup in my Ray Bans
Breakin' hearts like only you can
In your snapback
Woah-oh-oh-oh
Woah-oh-oh-oh
Woah-oh-oh-oh
In your snapback

[Outro]
Woah-oh-oh-oh
Woah-oh-oh-oh
Woah-oh-oh-oh
In your snapback
Woah-oh-oh-oh
Woah-oh-oh-oh
Woah-oh-oh-oh
In your snapback
Woah-oh-oh-oh
Woah-oh-oh-oh
Woah-oh-oh-oh
In your snapback

[Verse 1]
Seems innocent enough when your buying the drinks at the bar and you're both getting loaded
Don't even know just the danger you're in cause you're so caught up in the moment
But you shoot a smile cuts through the smoke
Hits you before you even know

[Chorus]
A girl is a gun
She's harder to handle than you think son
You feel safe when you're with her
Think twice before you pull the trigger
She feels good in your hand from the first little spark
But guns shoot bullets and bullets break hearts
Heartbreak's a bitch
She'll kill you with a kiss
So before careful when you're holding one
Cause a girl is a gun

[Verse 2]
She's cold and she's hot
She's fun but she's not some play thing two dollar pistol
Say the right thing she'll go off with a bang
But be careful cause she kicks a little
Hold her just right don't let her down
You're gonna get hurt if you mess around

[Chorus]
A girl is a gun
She's harder to handle than you think son
You feel safe when you're with her
Think twice before you pull the trigger
She feels good in your hand from the first little spark
But guns shoot bullets and bullets break hearts
Heartbreak's a bitch
She'll kill you with a kiss
So before careful when you're holding one
Cause a girl is a gun

[Chorus]
Yeah a girl is a gun
She's harder to handle than you think son
You feel safe when you're with her
Think twice before you pull the trigger
She feels good in your hand from the first little spark
But guns shoot bullets and bullets break hearts
Heartbreak's a bitch
She'll kill you with a kiss
So before careful when you're holding one
Cause a girl is a gun
Yeah a girl is a gun

[Verse 1]
Been flyin' solo for so long
Nobody's singin' the harmony
Up there just me and my shadow
No bass, no guitar, no tambourine

[Pre-Chorus 1]
And I found you like a melody
You were singin' in the same key as me
We had ‘em dancin' in the streets

[Chorus]
I don't wanna be a one man band
I don't wanna be a rolling stone, alone
Puttin' miles on a run-down van
Baby, we can take our own show on the road
I'll lay down the beat, you'll carry the tune
We'll get tattoos, and we'll trash hotel rooms
Baby, take my hand
I don't wanna be a one man band
No

[Verse 2]
I wanna run down your wild dreams
And I wanna chase every high with you
Count every rip in these old jeans
We'll never learn how to sing the blues

[Pre-Chorus 2]
If I'm gonna be famous
Girl, I wanna be famous with you
We got our own little groove

[Chorus]
I don't wanna be a one man band
I don't wanna be a rolling stone, alone
Puttin' miles on a run-down van
Baby, we can take our own show on the road
I'll lay down the beat, you'll carry the tune
We'll get tattoos, and we'll trash hotel rooms
Baby, take my hand
'Cause I don't wanna be a one man band

[Bridge]
When the spotlight goes cold, and the curtains come down
The chairs are all stacked, and there's no one around
And nobody's payin', we’ll still be playin'

[Chorus]
I don't wanna be a one man band
I don't wanna be a rolling stone, alone
Puttin' miles on a run-down van
Baby, we can take our own show on the road
I'll lay down the beat, you'll carry the tune
We'll get tattoos, and we'll trash hotel rooms
Baby, take my hand
'Cause I don't wanna be a one man band
I don't wanna be a one man band

[Verse 1]
Some don't last the way they should
Some make you feel good for a little while
And then you throw 'em away
Some are up on a shelf for some other time
Some are high dollar, some ain't worth a dime
But you keep 'em anyway

[Pre-Chorus]
Everybody's looking for something
So how do I catch your eye, eye, eye

[Chorus]
If you're shoe shopping walk a mile with me
Slip a Cinderella slipper right on your feet
Take my arm, strut down the street tonight
(Strut down that street tonight)
If you're downtown on the browse about
Looking for the perfect fit, how's about
Some high-heel, high-top, pump 'em up, flip-flop
Heads-up, lucky penny loafer on a sidewalk
Patent leather, blue suede, tailor made, whatever you like
If you're shoe shopping, try me on for size

[Verse 2]
You're stepping on cracks, you're breaking your back
You're working so damn hard just to make it look easy
Come dance with me 'cause dancing's free
Let me sweep you right off your feet
Whatever your style is, girl, that's what mine is
I could go good with your eyes

[Chorus]
If you're shoe shopping walk a mile with me
Slip a Cinderella slipper right on your feet
Take my arm, strut down the street tonight
(Strut down that street tonight)
If you're downtown on the browse about
Looking for the perfect fit, how's about
Some high-heel, high-top, pump 'em up, flip-flop
Heads-up, lucky penny loafer on a sidewalk
Patent leather, blue suede, tailor made, whatever you like
If you're shoe shopping, try me on for size

[Pre-Chorus]
Yeah, everybody's looking for something
So how do I catch your eye, eye, eye

[Chorus]
If you're shoe shopping walk a mile with me
Slip a Cinderella slipper right on your feet
Take my arm, strut down the street tonight
(Strut down that street tonight)
If you're downtown on the browse about
Looking for the perfect fit, how's about
Some high-heel, high-top, pump 'em up, flip-flop
Heads-up, lucky penny loafer on a sidewalk
Patent leather, blue suede, tailor made, whatever you like
If you're shoe shopping, try me on for size
Try me on for size
Try me on for size
Never know unless you try

[Chorus]
Yeah the song comes on and I sing out loud
And there ain't no road that I can't go down
And I don't think twice when I pass your house all the time
Yeah the rain just rolls right off my back
And I don't get caught in the same old traps
I can hear your name and fall asleep just fine
Yeah the world don't revolve around you
Not everything's about you

[Verse 1]
Sunsets happening
My phone rings
I'm finally laughing
And doing things with my friends

[Pre-Chorus]
We drink to this
We drink to that
Let's roll that 8 ball in the rack
It's what I have, not what I had

[Chorus]
And the song comes on and I sing out loud
And there ain't no road that I can't go down
And I don't think twice when I pass your house all the time
Yeah the rain just rolls right off my back
And I don't get caught in the same old traps
I can hear your name and fall asleep just fine
Yeah the world don't revolve around you
Not everything's about you anymore

[Verse 2]
She's got brown eyes
And her own place
Just last Friday
I picked her up and we went out

[Pre-Chorus]
We drank to this
We drank to that
I turned her onto Fleetwood Mac
It's what I have, not what I had

[Chorus]
Yeah the song comes on and I sing out loud
And there ain't no road that I can't go down
And I don't think twice when I pass your house all the time
Yeah the rain just rolls right off my back
And I don't get caught in the same old traps
I can hear your name and fall asleep just fine
Yeah the world don't revolve around you
Not everything's about you anymore

[Chorus]
Yeah the song comes on and I sing out loud
And there ain't no road that I can't go down
And I don't think twice when I pass your house all the time
Yeah the rain just rolls right off my back
And I don't get caught in the same old traps
I can hear your name and fall asleep just fine
Yeah the city lights and the midnight stars
And too many drinks in a Downtown bar
Don't mess me up like they did before
Yeah the world don't revolve around you
Not everything's about you anymore

[Outro]
Anymore
Yeah, Yeah
Oh, Oh

[Verse 1]
We took a u-turn down on 42nd street
Almost hit another car
Spilled my coffee on my jeans and I said
"Aw, they're ruined now"
She said
"Naw, they're better now. It's just a matter of perspective."
She kissed my cheek
Its the little imperfections that make'em unique
I don't know how she does it, but she could

[Chorus]
See the stars in the city
She sees a diamond when the world sees dust
Finds the glitter in the gritty
I know I ain't much but
That girl sees something  nobody else can see
When she sees something in me
Yeah she could see the stars in the city

[Verse 2]
The more I hang with her the more I realize
Their can be beauty in the broken if you open up your mind
She says thinks like
"Ain't this rain nice" and
"Don't sad songs make you smile"
Well if she's crazy
I wanna be crazy too
She's the kinda girl that can break up a band
I wanna see whatever she can

[Chorus]
See the stars in the city
She sees a diamond when the world sees dust
Finds the glitter in the gritty
I know I ain't much but
That girl sees something  nobody else can see
When she sees something in me
Yeah she could see the stars in the city

That girl sees something  nobody else can see
When she sees something in me
Yeah she could see the stars in the city
In the city

[Chorus]
See the stars in the city
The stars in the city
She sees a diamond when the world sees dust
Finds the glitter in the gritty
So pretty she can break you heart
Yeah she sees the stars in the city

[Outro]
In the city
She sees the stars in the city
Yeah

[Verse 1]
I know you're hurt, I know it's my fault
But I've kept "I'm sorry" locked in a vault
I know that time just keeps going on
And words by themselves can't right all the wrongs
In a world that's gone crazy, you don't know what's true
Most people don't change, but some people do

[Chorus]
Some people quit drinking too much
And some people quit lying
Some people decide to grow up
But it's never good timing
Most wouldn't forgive what I put you through
But I'm here tonight, hoping some people do

[Verse 2]
Some people say sorry to hear it's okay
But I know it's not so you don't have to say
That you understand 'cause I know you don't
And neither do I, that don't mean that I won't
Try everyday to show you the truth
Most people don't change, but some people do

[Chorus]
Some people quit drinking too much
And some people quit lying
Some people decide to grow up
But it's never good timing
Most wouldn't forgive what I put you through
But I'm here tonight, hoping some people do

[Bridge]
So whether you kiss me or you close the door
Just know that I'm better than I was before

[Chorus]
Some people quit drinking too much
And some people quit lying
Some people decide to grow up
But it's never good timing
Most wouldn't forgive what I put you through
But I'm here tonight, hoping some people do
I'm hoping some people do

You're home all alone, there's a buzz on your phone
Your friends say she's out at the bar with her friends so you go
You show up, look around, but you don't see her face
They tell you she probably went back to her place so you go
Then you knock on her door, but she won't let you in
She ain't ready to do this again...

So you go all kinds of crazy just thinking that she might be gone
You go out of your mind at the thought that she finally moved on
She tells you it's over, this time she means it.  She doesn't love you but you don't believe it

The beach where you met is a five hour drive
You know that you won't be sleeping tonight so you go
But the ocean's just water, the beach is just sand.  None of it matters, she ain't holding your hand so you go

So you go all kinds of crazy just thinking that she might be gone
You go out of your mind at the thought that she finally moved on
She tells you it's over, this time she means it.  She doesn't love you but you don't believe it
So you go all out and try to fix everything that you did wrong

She tells you it's over, this time she means it.  She doesn't love you but you don't believe it
So you go all out and try to fix everything that you did wrong

You're home all alone, there's a buzz on your phone, it's her and she asks if you wanna come over

[Verse 1]
Got a boy back home in Michigan
And he tastes like Jack when I'm kissing him
So I told him that I never really liked his friends
Now he's gone and he's calling me a bitch again
There's a guy that lives in the garden state
And he told me that we'd make it 'til we graduate
So I told him that the music would be worth the wait
But he wants me in the kitchen with a dinner plate

[Pre-Chorus]
I believe, I believe, I believe, I believe that we're meant to be
But jealousy, jealousy, jealousy, jealousy get the best of me
Look, I don't mean to frustrate, but I
Always make the same mistakes, yeah
Always make the same mistakes 'cause

[Chorus]
I'm bad at love (ooh-ooh)
But you can't blame me for tryin'
You know I'd be lyin' sayin'
You were the one (ooh-ooh)
That could finally fix me
Lookin' at my history
I'm bad at love

[Verse 2]
Got a girl with California eyes
And I thought that she could really be the one this time
But I never got the chance to make her mine
Because she fell in love with little thin white lines
London girl with an attitude
We never told no one, but we look so cute
Both got way better things to do
But I always think about her when I'm riding through

[Pre-Chorus]
I believe, I believe, I believe, I believe that I'm in too deep
And jealousy, jealousy, jealousy, jealousy get the best in me
Look, I don't mean to frustrate, but I
Always make the same mistakes, yeah
Always make the same mistakes

[Chorus]
I'm bad at love (ooh-ooh)
But you can't blame me for tryin'
You know I'd be lyin' sayin'
You were the one (ooh-ooh)
That could finally fix me
Lookin' at my history
I'm bad at love

[Post-Chorus]
Oh, you know, you know, you know, you know
I'm bad at love (ooh-ooh)
I'm bad at love (ooh-ooh)
I'm bad at love (ooh-ooh)

[Bridge]
I know that you're afraid I'm gonna walk away
Each time the feeling fades
Each time the feeling fades
I know that you're afraid I'm gonna walk away
Each time the feeling fades

[Chorus]
You know I'm bad at love (ooh-ooh)
But you can't blame me for tryin'
You know I'd be lyin' sayin'
You were the one (ooh-ooh)
That could finally fix me
Lookin' at my history
I'm bad at love (ooh-ooh)
Oh, you know, you know, you know, you know
I'm bad at love (ooh-ooh)
I'm bad at love (ooh-ooh)
Oh, oh, I'm bad at love

Grass stained bare feet
Dove in my front seat
Windshield full of road to run
And a gas tank full of freedom

Red sky faded to black
A couple cans deep in a six pack
World disappearing around us
Temptation always found us

With beer on our breath in a parking lot
Kill the headlights so we wouldn't get caught
Radio glow on the dash
We were messin' around
We could hardly breathe
Breakin' new ground in my back seat
We had our foot on the gas
Goin' nowhere fast

One summer of sunsets
Was as far as we were gonna get
So caught up in how it feels
We didn't care if we were spinnin' wheels

With beer on our breath in a parking lot
Kill the headlights so we wouldn't get caught
Radio glow on the dash
We were messin' around
We could hardly breathe
Breakin' new ground in my back seat
We had our foot on the gas
Goin' nowhere fast

Yeaahee

With beer on our breath in a parking lot
Kill the headlights so we wouldn't get caught
Here and gone in a flash
Yeah
We were messin' around
We could hardly breathe
Breakin' new ground in my back seat
No way to know if it would last
But we had our foot on the gas
Goin' nowhere fast
Goin' nowhere fast

[Verse 1]
The Sun going down on a little beach town out west
A wide open highway, a window seat on a jet
The sound of a train pulling out of the station
A man like me should find inspiration in anything
But here I am in this hotel room

[Chorus]
Still writing songs about
You on the sunny Santa Monica freeway
You on a bed and a mini bar three day haze
With your hair and my heart all a mess in the morning
I've gotten drunk on whiskey and women
Woke up in places that we've never been in
Spending all night and all day trying to say something new
But it's no use
I'm still writing songs about you

[Verse 2]
A pawn shop in Dallas cut me a deal on a six string
It doesn't know how you look, how you laugh, how you kiss me
Well I'm on the edge of the bed and it's way past two
I'm stuck on a line cause I know what rhymes with blue

[Chorus]
You on the sunny Santa Monica freeway
You on a bed and a mini bar three day haze
With your hair and my heart all a mess in the morning
I've gotten drunk on whiskey and women
Woke up in places that we've never been in
Spending all night and all day trying to say something new
But I'm still writing songs about you

[Bridge]
If you ever wake up and wonder what I'm up to
Baby I'm right here
Still writing songs about

[Chorus]
You on the sunny Santa Monica freeway
You on a bed and a mini bar three day haze
With your hair and my heart all a mess in the morning
Yeah, I've gotten drunk on whiskey and women
Woke up in places that we've never been in
Spending all night and all day trying to say something new
But it's no use
I'm still writing songs about you

[Outro]
Still writing songs about
Ooh yeah

Stopped and got a little gasoline at the old BP
Rollin round wound up in the middle of BFE
Spinnin these wheels down a road that we ain't ever seen

Who knows where we are

I get a little more lost every time I look in her eyes
It's hard to keep my hands on the wheel when she's looking so fine
I ride down any back road that she wants me to drive
With the

Seat laid back running
Fingers through my hair
Watching miles go by
Like she just don't care
Looking at me with
One thing on her mind

Woah

I guess I'm making all the right wrong turns tonight

Something about the sound of the gravel setting the mood
Is got me thinking I should park this thing underneath the moon
And wrap ourselves all around each other like a vine of kudzu
With the

Seat laid back running
Fingers through my hair
Watching miles go by
Like she just don't care
Looking at me with
One thing on her mind

Woah

I guess I'm making all the right wrong turns tonight

Who knows where this is winding up
I don't mind if its getting late
Lucky stars are lining up
She's loving every move I make

With the

Seat laid back running
Fingers through my hair
Watching miles go by
Like she just don't care
Looking at me with
One thing on her mind

Woah
I guess I'm making all the right wrong turns tonight
Woah
I guess I'm making all the right wrong turns tonight
Woah

[Verse 1]
You could be the President
You would get my vote
You could be the Captain of whatever floats your boat
You could be the singer girl
You hit every note

[Chorus]
Like your Daddy told ya when you were a little girl
"You could be anything"
Why don't you be with me
Why don't you
Why don't you
Your Mama brought you up in a woman's world
You could be anything
Why don't you be with me
Why don't you
Why don't you
Be my drink
Be my song
Be my bed
Be my car
Be my photograph
Be my day
Be my night
Be my right
Be my wrong
Be my first and last

[Verse 2]
A tiger versus you girl, ain't even a fight
Next to you the sun can't even call itself a light
All the girls are jealous, cause all the guys are like
Ooh, ooh
Yeah

[Chorus]
Like your Daddy told ya when you were a little girl
"You could be anything"
Why don't you be with me
Why don't you
Why don't you
Your Mama brought you up in a woman's world
You could be anything
Why don't you be with me
Why don't you
Why don't you
Be with me
Be with me
Be with me
Why don't you
Why don't you
Be my drink
Be my song
Be my bed
Be my car
Be my photograph
Be my day
Be my night
Be my right
Be my wrong
Be my first and last
Be my where you at
Where ya at?
Ooh, ooh

[Chorus]
Like your Daddy told ya when you were a little girl
"You could be anything"
Why don't you be with me
Why don't you
Why don't you
Your Mama brought you up in a woman's world
You could be anything
Why don't you be with me
Why don't you
Why don't you
Be with me
Be with me
Be with me
Why don't you
Why don't you
Be with me
Be with me
Be with me
Why don't you
Why don't you

[Outro]
Be with me
Be with me
Be with me
Why don't you
Why don't you

My friends call me up 'cause they know I'm down
Take me out to paint the town
Help me get over it
The pretty blonde girl at the end of the bar buys a drink gives a wink then it goes too far
We're out on the dance floor feeling the gin
I finally start coming alive again
I take her home for the night and everything's right 'til the first ray of sunlight
Damn if I don't wake up loving you
I wake up loving you
I thought if I could catch a plane touch down out of town somewhere nobody knows you
Maybe I could get myself half of a chance
To get a life and act like a different man
But my best of intentions were all shot to hell
When I found myself hiding in a cheap hotel
Drowning in whiskey staring at the TV trying not to sleep because I'm just gonna wake up loving you
Yeah
I wake up loving you
No matter what I say or do I just can't get the message through to my heart that you're gone
I just can't shut it off
Yeah
I wake up loving you
Yeah
I wake up loving you
Remember when I told you I was never gonna stop loving you with all my heart and soul no matter what
Now I guess I'm eating every promise that I made
Cause every night I'm desperate asking god if he could just let me forget
But I wake up loving you
I wake up loving you
I wake up loving you
Yeah
I wake up loving you
No matter what I say or do baby I wake up loving you
Yeah
I wake up lovin you
Oh
When I wake up
Yeah
Wake up loving you
Yeah

[Verse 1]
I never liked Def Leppard 'til I heard you sing that song
I never wanted to go to Cali 'til you had that t-shirt on
I never wanted to change my style, change my point of view
The truth is girl, I'd take this whole damn thing and change it all for you

[Chorus]
You got that real thing, that good vibe-y feel thing
That roller coaster thrill thing that just keeps turnin' me on (Oh)
Gives me that heart rush, that can't help but wanna touch
And I just can't get enough, baby just keep bringin' it on (Oh)

[Post Chorus]
Crazy, beautiful, sexy, unusual
Innocent, provocative, so classic, you're rockin' it
Crazy, beautiful, sexy

[Verse 2]
I wanna be one of those late night things that keeps you up
I wanna be the digits that you dial when you get drunk
I wanna be that smile that's on your face that all your friends don't understand
I'll be the stamp from the club that won't wash off your hand

[Chorus]
You got that real thing, that good vibe-y feel thing
That roller coaster thrill thing that just keeps turnin' me on (Oh)
Gives me that heart rush, that can't help but wanna touch
And I just can't get enough, baby just keep bringin' it on (Oh)

[Post Chorus]
Crazy, beautiful, sexy, unusual
Innocent, provocative, so classic, you're rockin' it
Crazy, beautiful, sexy

[Bridge]
Candy smooth, your midnight moves, your go-to groove
Whatever you got, it's sunshine hot, girl, I need you

[Chorus]
You got that real thing, that good vibe-y feel thing
That roller coaster thrill thing that just keeps turnin' me on (Oh)
Gives me that heart rush, that can't help but wanna touch
And I just can't get enough, baby just keep bringin' it on (Oh)

[Post Chorus]
Crazy, beautiful, sexy, unusual
Innocent, provocative, so classic, you're rockin' it
Crazy, beautiful, sexy
Crazy, beautiful, sexy

[Verse 1]
Girl you're like a model on a Soho street
Walking on air like you own it
It's like I'm sipping on a bottle in a penthouse suite
You're lighting me up and I'm glowing

[Pre-Chorus]
With that just right Friday night curl in your hair
Got my heart beating louder than Madison Square
That electric energy
Something tells me you're gonna keep me going til the morning light
Girl your like

[Chorus]
New York at night
(I ain't gonna be sleeping)
New York at night
(Girl you got me feeling)
Empire high
That uptown something
Its got me coming alive
Baby you're like
New York at night

[Verse 2]
A party ain't a party girl til you walk in
Cause where you are is where everything happens
You could spin the globe and no matter where it lands
Kick your feet up and call it Manhattan

[Pre-Chorus]
You're like a Tiffany mannequin  down on 5th Avenue
Making every other woman wishing they could be you
That electric energy
Something tells me you're gonna keep me going til the morning light
Girl your like

[Chorus]
New York at night
(I ain't gonna be sleeping)
New York at night
(Girl you got me feeling)
Empire high
That Uptown something
Its got me coming alive
Baby you're like
New York at night

Girl you're like a model on a Soho street
Walking on air like you own it

[Chorus]
New York at night
(I ain't gonna be sleeping)
New York at night
(Girl you got me feeling)
Empire high
That Uptown something
Its got me coming alive
Baby you're like

[Chorus]
New York at night
(I ain't gonna be sleeping)
New York at night
(Girl you got me feeling)
Empire high
That Uptown something
Its got me coming alive
Baby you're like
New York at night

[Outro]
New York at night
Empire high

[Verse 1]
A girl like you in a bar like this
Well no offense but you don't fit in
Red lipstick on the rim of that glass
All dressed up, all by yourself, whats up with that?

[Pre-Chorus]
Are you here to chill
Are you here to party
Are you just here trying to get over somebody
Is it a high, or is it a low
Baby I just gotta know

[Chorus]
Is your glass half full or is it half empty
Are you only having one or one too many
Are you drinking alone or having one more with me
Is your glass half full or is it half empty

[Verse 2]
Is this take a seat or take a hike
Is it take a shot or on the rocks tonight
Is it lonely or just alone
Would you wanna tap your number in if I handed you my phone

[Pre-Chorus]
Are you here to chill
Are you here to party
Are you just here trying to meet somebody
Letting me get to you or letting me go
Baby I just gotta know

[Chorus]
Is your glass half full or is it half empty
Are you leaning to the side of the 50/50
Are you leaving alone or leaving here with me
Is your glass half full or is it half empty

[Verse 3]
Are you windin' up
Or windin' down
Are you paying your tab
Or are we painting the town

[Chorus]
Is your glass half full or is it half empty
Are you only having one or one too many
Are you drinking alone or having one more with me
One more with me

[Outro]
Is your glass half full or is it half empty
Are you leaning to the side of the 50/50
Are you leaving alone or leaving here with me
Is your glass half full or is it half empty

I can't get you off the tip of my tongue
You're running through my head again
Like one of those summer sing-a-long songs
I can't get you off the tip of my tongue
You're running through my head again
Like one of those summer sing-a-long songs
I play you once and you're just stuck 'em in
I'm either talkin' about ya or thinkin' about ya
Or runnin' my mouth about bein' without ya to all my friends

Shut me up by showing up
With strawberry stuff on your lips you know I like so much
Just a little kiss will do the trick
Give me something else to do with my lips
Cause I go on and on when you're gone
You're the only one who can shut me up

I get sick of the sound of my own voice
When I get a couple drinks in me
I gotta admit the way you got me whipped
You know it's kinda embarrassing
I'm tired of the drama so hey little mama, I'm hopin' you wanna
So tell me you're gonna be on your way

Shut me up by showing up
With strawberry stuff on your lips you know I like so much
Just a little kiss will do the trick
Give me something else to do with my lips
Cause I go on and on when you're gone
You're the only one who can shut me up

I'm either talkin' about ya or thinkin' about ya
Or runnin' my mouth about bein' without ya to all my friends
So come on and

Shut me up by showing up
With strawberry stuff on your lips you know I like so much
Just a little kiss will do the trick
Give me something else to do with my lips
Yeah baby
Shut me up with your love
Just one little taste, baby watch what it does
Just a little kiss will do the trick
Give me something else to do with my lips
Cause I go on and on when you're gone
You're the only one who can shut me up

Yeah, baby shut me up
Oh yeah
Shut me up!

[Verse 1]
She was sneakin' up her sundress, showing off her tatty
She said, "I like your ride, maybe you could be my caddy
What you say you pick us up a six-pack of Natty?"
Aww nice
She had a sweet little southern twang
Said, "We don't have to talk about forever things
For tonight maybe we could just hang like a pair of dice"

[Pre-Chorus]
Said, whatever girl, you know I'm down
I was thinkin' we could crush this town

[Chorus]
Like a beer can in a truck bed
On a slow ride in the sunset (Hey)
Bouncin' down a small town street
Let's pop the top right off this thing
I need a cold drink 'cause you're a hot mess
Let the night do what it does best (Hey)
Shake me up and baby turn me loose
I just wanna roll around with you
Like a beer can in a truck bed

[Verse 2]
I said, "Girl you got your shades on, looking like you're famous
We could turn this little one horse into Vegas
Holdin' you is like I'm holdin' all the aces
I can't lose"

[Pre-Chorus]
She said, "Come on, boy, pour it on"
She didn't know that I was already gone

[Chorus]
Like a beer can in a truck bed
On a slow ride in the sunset (Hey)
Bouncin' down a small town street
Let's pop the top right off this thing
I need a cold drink 'cause you're a hot mess
Let the night do what it does best (Hey)
Shake me up and baby turn me loose
I just wanna roll around with you
Like a beer can in a truck bed
Yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
I said, "Whatever girl, you know I'm down
I was thinkin' we could crash this town"

[Chorus]
Like a beer can in a truck bed
On a slow ride in the sunset
Bouncin' down a small town street
Let's pop the top right off this thing
I need a cold drink 'cause you're a hot mess
Let the night do what it does best
Shake me up and baby turn me loose
I just wanna roll around with you
Like a beer can in a truck bed (Hey)
I just wanna roll around with you
Like a beer can in a truck bed
I just wanna roll around with you
Hey babe, I just wanna get down with you
Hey babe, I just wanna roll around with you
Hey babe, I just wanna get down with you
Hey babe, I just wanna roll around with you
Like a beer can in a truck bed

Hey, you don't have to stay
You don't have to say
Anything that you don't wanna say
Hey, you don't have to go
We can take it slow
Or we can move it alone, move it along

We can keep it on the couch
And keep the lights on
Naked makin' out, or keep our clothes on
Don't worry 'bout where it's going
If it dead ends, or if it's headed

Up the stairs or down the block
If it last forever until one o'clock

It is what it is 'til it was what it was
Let it do what it does 'til it's over
If it's right then it's right
If it's wrong then it's wrong
Let's keep playing the song 'til it's over

If it's love if it ain't if it's only the drinks
And it just hangs around 'til we're sober
It is what it is 'til it was what it was
Let it do what it does 'til it's over
'Til is over

So we never really know
Which way the wind's goin' blow
So let's ride it out for a while right here
You can spend the night, but you don't have to
I can spend the night just looking at you
Here I cannot lie where's going
If it dead ends, or if it's headed

Upstairs or down the block
If it lasts forever or until three o'clock

It is what it is 'til it was what it was
Let it do what it does 'til it's over
If it's right then it's right
If it's wrong then it's wrong
Let's keep playing the song 'til it's over

If it's love if it ain't if it's only the drinks
And it just hangs around 'til we're sober
It is what it is 'til it was what it was
Let it do what it does 'til it's over
'Til is over

Let's just let it be
Put your hands on me
Let's not worry about tomorrow
Or the rest of our lives

Let's just let it be
Put your hands on me
All I know is we gonna be alright
It's gonna be alright

It is what it is 'til it was what it was
Let it do what it does 'til it's over
If it's right then it's right
If it's wrong then it's wrong
Let's keep playing the song 'til it's over

If it's love if it ain't if it's only the drinks
And it just hangs around 'til we're sober
It is what it is 'til it was what it was
Let it do what it does 'til it's over
'Til is over
'Til is over

I'm tired of having fun
I'm sick of watching that sunset, painting the sky red
I just wanna turn in early
I don't want to see where this goes
You're getting just a little too flirty
You're getting just a little too close

Said nobody
Said nobody, ever
Said nobody
Said nobody, ever

Don't come any closer
Don't give me a kiss
Cause I don't wanna taste your lips
Said nobody
Said nobody, ever

I wish you'd just behave
I wish that strap would stay, up there on your shoulder
I don't want to buy you another drink
I'd rather go home alone instead
I don't wanna wake up in the morning
Slide to your side of the bed

Said nobody
Said nobody, ever
Said nobody
Said nobody, ever

Don't come any closer
Don't give me a kiss
Cause I don't wanna taste your lips
Said nobody
Said nobody, ever

I don't wanna know what it feels like
To be loved by a girl like you
Last thing I need is your heart beating to my heart beat
And I don't wanna hear you say
Ooohhhh, baby

Said nobody
Said nobody, ever
Said nobody
Said nobody, ever

Don't come any closer
Don't give me a kiss
Cause I don't wanna taste your lips
Said nobody
Said nobody, ever

Said nobody
Said nobody, ever
Ooohhhh, baby
Ooohhhh, baby
Yeah

[Verse 1]
We got the songs
We got the beats
We got the bar
Where we used to meet
We got our names
In the concrete
On Lincoln street
And we got New York
We got L.A
We got that run-down hotel where we stayed
We got so drunk
We jumped in the pool
Slept in all day

[Pre-Chorus]
And when we were in it
Yeah, we were in it
Long before we said goodbye
Just for a minute
We got it right
We got it right

[Chorus]
Yeah, we got the looks
We got the lights
We got the days
We got the nights
Even though it ended
We got it right

[Verse 2]
We got tequila
We got tattoos
Heart with a dagger
Nothing to lose
Black and white strip
From that photo booth
We thought we were cool
And now you got someone else
And I got mine
Neither one of 'em knows that every time
They play Meet Virginia
I'm on your mind
And you're on mine (girl, you're on mine)

[Pre-Chorus]
And when we were in it
Yeah, we were in it
Long before we said goodbye
Just for a minute
We got it right
We got it right

[Chorus]
Yeah, we got the looks
We got the lights
We got the days
We got the nights
Even though it ended
We got it right

[Pre-Chorus]
And when we were in it
Yeah, we were in it
Long before we said goodbye
Just for a minute
We got it right

[Outro]
Yeah, we got the looks
We got the lights
We got the days
We got the nights
We got it right
We got it right
We got it right

(What I need is a man, what I need is a man
Who knows something about these things)
[x2]
I know you got this little game you play
Whippin’ round your pony tail
Like you know it’s hot as hell
Gettin’ all the fellas jealous
Cause you like to kiss and tell
Just to make my heart swell
Girl, you must not know me well
If you think I’ll stand for that
Not reach out my hand for that
You drive me out of my mind with that
Ain’t nobody got time for that so…
When you think you’re good and ready
You know right where you can get me
Light your number up on my cell
If you wanna rock with me, then I will roll
We can pick that lock and drive it like we stole it
With the radio up, edge of this town, little sundress, let your hair down
Driving me wild, girl just say go, I’ll be on you
Like dirt on a road
(What I need is a man, what I need is a man
Who knows something about these things)
My mama taught me how to treat a lady with respect
But what the heck did you expect with the perfume on your neck
Is smellin’ all so good, peaches and cream
You’re so fly you make a trout want to jump right out the stream
So, walk those little boots you’re wearing
Over here to where I’m standing
Let’s get to causing a scene…
If you wanna rock with me, then I will roll
We can pick that lock and drive it like we stole it
With the radio up, edge of this town, little sundress, let your hair down
Driving me wild, girl just say go, I’ll be on you
Like dirt on a road
[x2]
(What I need is a man, what I need is a man)
Like dirt on a road
(What I need is a man, what I need is a man)
Like dirt on a road
(What I need is a man, what I need is a man
Who knows something about these things)

[Verse 1]
In a crowded restaurant when I see you
You’re there even when you’re not, I see you
In my bones, in my head
In my t-shirt, in my bed

[Chorus]
And it feels like I’m
(Surrounded, surrounded, surrounded)
And it feels so right
(Surrounded, surrounded, surrounded)
I lost my way
(You found me, you found me, you found me)
And I wanna stay
Surrounded

[Verse 2]
I was on an aimless road before you
Just another nameless soul before you
Wrapped me up with open arms
Laid me down, let down my guard

[Chorus]
And it feels like i’m
(Surrounded, surrounded, surrounded)
And it feels so right
(Surrounded, surrounded, surrounded)
I lost my way
(You found me, you found me, you found me)
And I wanna stay
Surrounded

[Bridge]
You're the ocean, I'm an island
(Ooh)
You're the night that I can hide in

[Chorus]
And it feels like I’m
(Surrounded, surrounded, surrounded)
And it feels so right
(Surrounded, surrounded, surrounded)
I lost my way
(You found me, you found me, you found me)
And I wanna stay
Surrounded

[Verse 1]
Hey there, weird kid in your high-top shoes
Sitting in the back of the class; I was just like you
Always left out, never fit in
Owning that path you're walking in
Mr. Misunderstood, Mr. Misunderstood

[Verse 2]
Now, your buddies get their rocks off on Top 40 radio
But you love your daddy's vinyl, old-time rock and roll
Elvis Costello, Ray Wylie Hubbard
And think Jeff Tweedy is one bad mother
Mr. Misunderstood, Mr. Misunderstood

[Chorus]
One day you'll lead the charge, you'll lead the band
Guitar Hero with lightnin' hands
And the girls will like your tattoos and the veins in your arms
They'll be helpless to your musical charms
And they'll all hold up their hands
They'll all wanna dance
Mr. Misunderstood, Mr. Misunderstood

[Verse 3]
First time I met Alabama Hannah, I was skinny as a rail
Red hair tied up in a blue bandanna
She was hotter than the Devil's hell
She turned me on to Back Porch Pickers
Jackson Pollock, and gin
Her daddy didn't trust my intentions
So he turned to his daddy's old .410
I'm Mr. Misunderstood, Mr. Misunderstood

[Chorus]
Had an axe to grind, so off I went
Mad at the sun for coming up again
I lost religion, found my soul in the blues
Rubbed the velvet off my blue suede shoes
Yeah, everybody held up their hands
And every soul on Beale Street danced
With Mr. Misunderstood, Mr. Misunderstood

[Verse 4]
So I went with it like a colt on my Plymouth
Through the glass behind my rear-view
Took a left when the world went right down 16th Avenue
Played with fire and I played on ledges
Every circus, stage, and county fair
They tried to file my points, sand my edges
And I just grew out my hair
I'm Mr. Misunderstood, I'm Mr. Misunderstood

[Chorus]
They're standing in line, chasing the buzz
Til the next big things and already was
And hell if they know what they're trying to find
If it ain't that same old, been-done kind
Yeah, gives the head-scratchers fits
Wondering how in the hell they missed
I'm Mr. Misunderstood, Mr. Misunderstood

[Verse 5]
Hey there, weird kid in your high-top shoes
Sitting in the back of the class; I was just like you
Mr. Misunderstood (I understand)
Mr. Misunderstood (I understand)
Mr. Misunderstood (I understand)
Mr. Misunderstood (I understand)
Mr. Misunderstood (I understand)
I'm Mr. Misunderstood (let's go out of here)

[Outro]
Na na na na-na, na na na na-na
Na na na na-na na (I understand)
Na na na na-na, na na na na-na
Na na na na-na na (I understand)
Na na na na-na, na na na na-na
Na na na na-na na (I understand)
Na na na na-na, na na na na-na
Na na na na-na na (I understand...)
Na na na na-na, na na na na-na
Na na na na-na na
Na na na na-na, na na na na-na
Na na na na-na na

[Verse 1]
Since you turned the tables on me
I've been steady and learnin' lonely
Keepin' this turntable spinnin'
Everything from Jones to Jennings
Slowly plannin' my survival
In a three-foot stack of vinyl
Since you had to walk on outta here
I've been havin' a record year

[Verse 2]
I bet you thought before you left
I'd just sit in silence by myself
Turn this house into a jail
Dyin' slow in a livin' hell
But love's got a funny way of keepin' score
And your leavin' lit up my scoreboard
I usually make it through side A sober
All bets are off when I flip her over
One bourbon, one scotch, one beer
I'm havin' a record year

[Chorus]
Quarter notes and Hank's half time
Are poundin' on this heart of mine
Song to song, I pass my time
With these speakers on ten
Your good-and-gone keeps me up all night
Along with Songs In The Key of Life
I'm either gonna get over you
Or I'm gonna blow out my ears
Yeah, you're out there now
Doin' God knows how, and I'm stuck here
Havin' a record year

[Verse 3]
Your leavin' left me goin' crazy
I'm countin' on a needle to save me
I drop it in the groove
And we go 'round and 'round
And down in a spiral
I guess I really oughta call and thank you
I rediscovered  Red Headed Stranger
Got down with old James Brown
And found New Grass Revival
If you find your way back, I owe you a beer
For my record year

[Chorus]
Quarter notes and Hank's half time
Are poundin' on this heart of mine
Song to song, I pass my time
With these speakers on ten
Your good-and-gone keeps me up all night
Along with Songs In The Key Of Life
I'm either gonna get over you
Or I'm gonna blow out my ears
Yeah, you're out there now
Doin' God knows how, and I'm stuck here
Havin' a record year
Yeah, I'm havin' a record year

[Verse 1]
Beer don't keep
Love’s not cheap
And trucks don't wreck themselves
Mama ain't a shrink
Daddy ain't a bank
And God ain't a wishin' well
Money ain't rich
Everybody sins
And nobody wins in a fight
And sometimes wrong is right

[Chorus]
Some of it you learn the hard way
Some of it you read on a page
Some of it comes from heartbreak
Most of it comes with age
And none of it ever comes easy
A bunch of it you maybe can't use
I know I don't probably know what I think I do
But there's something to some of it

[Verse 2]
Girls like to laugh
Tears don't last
And scared's what praying's for
If it's close, swing the bat
Everybody's gotta past
And love's worth living for
When you dance, hold her close
'Til it breaks, go for broke
Be the first to reach for her hand
No, you don't get to do some things again

[Chorus]
Some of it you learn the hard way
Some of it you read on a page
Some of it comes from heartbreak
Most of it comes with age
And none of it ever comes easy
A bunch of it you maybe can't use
I know I don't probably know what I think I do
But there's something to some of it

[Bridge]
When you can take it slow
'Cause time sure won't
What really makes you a man
Is being true to her 'til your glass runs out of sand

[Chorus]
Some of it you learn the hard way
Some of it you read on a page
Some of it comes from heartbreak
Most of it comes with age
And none of it ever comes easy
A bunch of it you maybe can't use
I know I don't probably know what I think I do
But there's something to some of it
Some of it

[Verse 1]
I, I been gone
Been gone too long, singing my songs on the road
Another town, one more show and I'm coming home
Don't give a damn what these keys are for
I'm gonna knock down that front door, and

[Chorus]
I'ma find out what that house is made of
Been too many nights since it's felt us make love
I wanna rock some sheetrock, knock some pictures off the wall
Love you baby, like a wrecking ball

[Verse 2]
You, look at you
Send me one more shot sitting on a bathroom sink
Damn you really turn me on painting your toenails pink
Easy baby before you say but if I can make it just one more day, and

[Chorus]
That old house is gonna be shaking
I hope those bricks and boards can take it
But I won't be surprised if the whole damn place just falls
I'm gonna rock you baby, like a wrecking ball

That old house is gonna be shaking
Rafter rocking, foundation quaking
Crash right through the front door, back you up against the wall
Love you baby
Take it right there baby
Rock you baby, like a wrecking ball

[Verse 1]
Another Friday night there's a line of cars leavin'
Home team's got an out-of-towner
Me, I'm sittin' on the hood of mine drinkin'
I'm just a parkin' lot down-and-outer

[Verse 2]
Under that high school bleacher
I drove that preacher's daughter crazy
Her mama was my homeroom teacher
And her dad was hell bent on savin' me

[Pre-Chorus]
Yeah, I'm sure there's higher highs
Where the high risers rise
But me, I'm gonna sit right here tonight, and

[Chorus]
Catch me a 'round here buzz
'Cause you ain't 'round here none
Keep puttin' 'em down here, 'nother round here
'Til my down goes up
Lit up like that one stoplight
Across from that welcome sign
Ever since you caught that out there bug
I catch me a 'round here buzz

[Verse 3]
I never had big-city eyes
Hell, I've never been east of Dallas
Got no idea where you are now
Or if you ever got that penthouse palace

[Pre-Chorus]
No, Scotty's ain't got no vibe
Got no gas in his neon light
But he's got two-for-one 'til 2:00 tonight

[Chorus]
Catch me a 'round here buzz
'Cause you ain't 'round here none
Keep puttin' 'em down here, 'nother round here
'Til my down goes up
Lit up like that one stoplight
Across from that welcome sign
Ever since you caught that out there bug
I catch me a 'round here buzz

[Interlude]

[Chorus]
Catch me a 'round here buzz
'Cause you ain't 'round here none
Keep puttin' 'em down here, 'nother round here
'Til my down here
Is lit up like that one stoplight
Across from that welcome sign
Ever since you caught that out there bug
I catch me a 'round here buzz

[Outro]
I catch me a 'round here buzz
'Round here buzz
I catch me a 'round here buzz

[Verse 1]
Use every crayon color that you've got
A fishing pole sinks faster than a tackle box
Nothing turns a day around like licking a mixing bowl
I learned that from a three year old

[Verse 2]
A garbage can is a damn good spot to hide truck keys
Why go inside when you can go behind a tree?
Walking barefoot through the mud
Will knock the rust right off your soul
I learned that from a three year old

[Chorus]
You can be a cowboy on the moon
Dig to China with a spoon
Talk to Jesus on the phone
Say "I love you" all day long
And when you're wrong, you should just say so
I learned that from a three year old

[Verse 3]
"Mama is an angel," I heard him tell the man upstairs
He went on and on and back and forth
Like God was laying there
Tonight, I sleep me down to lay and pray to keep my soul
Yeah, I learned that from a three year old

[Chorus]
You can be a cowboy on the moon
Dig to China with a spoon
Talk to Jesus on the phone
Say "I love you" all day long
And when you're wrong, you should just say so
I learned that from a three year old

[Outro]
Sometimes, all you need is a hand to hold
Couple arms to kill the cold
And when I'm wrong, I should just say so
I learned that from a three year old
Yeah, honey, I learned that from our three year old

[Verse 1]
To this day when I hear that song
I see you standin' there on that lawn
Discount shades, store bought tan
Flip flops and cut-off jeans
Somewhere between that setting sun
I'm on Fire and Born to Run
You looked at me and I was done
And we're, we're just getting started

[Verse 2]
I was singin' to you, you were singin' to me
I was so alive, never been more free
Fired up my daddy's lighter and we sang
Oohh
Stayed there 'til they forced us out
And took the long way to your house
I can still hear the sound of you sayin' don't go

[Chorus]
When I think about you, I think about 17
I think about my old jeep
I think about the stars in the sky
Funny how a melody sounds like a memory
Like the soundtrack to a July Saturday night
Springsteen

[Verse 3]
I bumped into you by happenstance
You probably wouldn't even know who I am
But if I whispered your name I bet there'd still be a spark
Back when I was gasoline
And this old tattoo had brand new ink
And we didn't care what your mom would think
About your name on my arm

[Verse 4]
Baby, is it spring or is it summer?
The guitar sound or the beat of that drummer
You hear sometimes late at night
On your radio
Even though you're a million miles away
When you hear Born in the USA
You relive those glory days
So long ago

[Chorus]
When you think about me, do you think about 17
Do you think about my old jeep
Think about the stars in the sky
Funny how a melody sounds like a memory
Like a soundtrack to a July Saturday night
Springsteen
Springsteen

[Bridge]
Woah-oh-oh-oh
Woah-oh-oh-oh
Woah-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Woah-oh-oh-oh
Woah-oh-oh-oh
Woah-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

[Refrain]
Funny how a melody sounds like a memory
Like a soundtrack to a July Saturday night
Springsteen
Springsteen
Woah Springsteen

[Outro]
Woah-oh-oh-oh
Woah-oh-oh-oh
Woah-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Woah-oh-oh-oh
Woah-oh-oh-oh
Woah-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Woah-oh-oh-oh
Woah-oh-oh-oh
Woah-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Woah-oh-oh-oh
Woah-oh-oh-oh
Woah-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

[Verse 1]
I don't why it does but it sure do, don't it, honey?
Bein' in love with you is as easy as spendin' money
Keep me higher than the fog, it's a-hidin' my copper line-ups
Yeah, there ain't no landing gear on this big jetliner

[Chorus]
Benedictine baby
Chartreuse snake old lady
Appalachia moonshine crazy
Bible belt and a sinner's fire
Love on a higher wire

[Verse 2]
Brother, it's a mother undercover with a voodoo woman
Roll the dice, bet your life every night, keep the black magic comin'
I should run from you like a vampire does from daylight
But I don't know how to quit 'cause I know what addiction tastes like

[Chorus]
Benedictine baby
Chartreuse snake old lady
Appalachia moonshine crazy
Bible belt and a sinner's fire
Love on a higher wire

[Bridge]
I rode on twenty
Bet on black
Roll them bones
Drink my Jack
Go all in
Call my bluff
And don't nothin' keep me comin' back again

[Chorus]
Benedictine baby
Chartreuse snake old lady
Appalachia moonshine crazy
Bible belt and a sinner's fire
Lo-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa
On a higher wire

[Verse 1: Eric Church]
Turn on a neon light
At least make it feel like night
Put on some this or that
And maybe I won't feel so bad
Need a little background noise
To drown out this little voice
Running circles 'round my brain
Screaming louder than the pain

[Chorus: Both]
My head is spinning
My resolve is reeling
I can tell by the heavy in my heart
I'm going down soon
No use fighting the fight
It's no contest tonight
My figured out's never been more confused
Having mixed drinks about feelings and you

[Verse 2: Susan Tedeschi]
Turn off the bedroom light
Put on a brave face and face the night
It's either get used to this dread
Or the cold spot in our bed
The bottle helps, but the memory burns
The whiskey soothes, but I toss and turn
I'll find sleep 'til dreams relent
Wake up tired and try again

[Chorus: Both]
My head is spinning
My resolve is reeling
I can tell by the heavy in my heart
I'm going down soon
No use fighting the fight
It's no contest tonight
My figured out's never been more confused
Having mixed drinks about feelings and you
Having mixed drinks about feelings and you

[Outro]
Turn on a neon light
At least make it feel like night

[Verse 1]
I killed my first monster when I was seven years old
He melted like butter in my bathroom's sixty-watt bulb
Kept a three-cell MagLite from Daddy's workshop drawer
Under my pillow and I'd pull it like a sword

[Chorus]
Anymore when a restless feelin' keeps me up at night
Fallin' on my knees is my new turnin' on the light
I keep my faith intact, make sure my prayers are said
'Cause I've learned that the monsters ain't the ones beneath the bed

[Verse 2]
The wolf hunts a hungry man and the devil a lonely heart
A minefield of bad decisions lay hidin' in the dark
Greed stalks, sickness steals, and pride lays a wicked trap
You can't avoid 'em all, no, you gotta trust me on that

[Chorus]
Anymore when a restless feelin' keeps me up at night
Fallin' on my knees is my new turnin' on the light
I keep my faith intact, and make sure my prayers are said
'Cause I've learned that the monsters ain't the ones beneath the bed

[Verse 3]
Daddy, check my closet, leave on the bathroom light
I smile and say, "All clear" when I tuck him in for the night
But Daddy, I'm still scared, can I sleep with you instead?
I kneel down beside my little man and I bow my head

[Chorus]
Anymore when a restless feelin' keeps me up at night
Fallin' on my knees is my new turnin' on the light
I keep my faith intact, make sure my prayers are said
'Cause I've learned that the monsters ain't the ones beneath the bed
And I've learned that the monsters ain't underneath the bed

[Verse 1]
She's caviar and mascara
I'm corduroy and leather
It'd take one hell of an imagination
To ever paint us together

[Verse 2]
Places I like to haunt at
She wouldn't be caught dead
Don't make sense to the neighbors, don't look good on paper
And sure don't make sense in my head

[Chorus]
But I got a heart like a wheel, baby, let's go
Get in this heart like a wheel and baby, we'll roll

[Verse 3]
Can't say there won't be rough patches
Scratches from thorns and briars
Over or under, we'll roll like thunder
As long as there's tread on these tires

[Chorus]
I got a heart like a wheel, baby, let's go
Get in this heart like a wheel and baby, let's roll

[Bridge]
Ain't no map, ain't no way
Ain't no lights on this long highway
But I know the way by heart
Bring on the dark
Honey, don't worry

[Chorus]
Baby, I got a heart like a wheel, baby, let's go
Get in this heart like a wheel and baby, let's roll
I got a heart like a wheel, baby, let's go
Get in this heart like a wheel and baby, we roll
Get in this heart like a wheel and baby, let's go

[Verse 1]
If I could kill a word and watch it die
I'd poison "never," shoot goodbye
Beat "regret" when I felt I had the nerve
Yeah, I'd pound "fear" to a pile of sand
Choke "lonely" out with my bare hands
I'd hang "hate" so that it can't be heard
If I could only kill a word

[Verse 2]
I'd take "brokeness" out back
And break "heartbreak," stand there and laugh
Right in its face while shootin' it the bird
I'd put "upset" down in its place
I'd squeeze the life out of "disgrace"
Lay "over" under six cold feet of dirt
If I could only kill a word

[Chorus]
Give me sticks, give stones
Bend my body, break my bones
Use staff and rod to turn me black and blue
Cause you can't unhear, you can't unsay
But if were up to me to change
I'd turn "lies" and "hate" to "love" and "truth"
If I could only kill a word

[Verse 3]
I'd knock out "temptation"'s teeth
I'd sever "evil," let it bleed
Then light up "wicked," stand and watch it burn
I'd take "vice" and I'd take "vile"
Tie 'em up there with "hostile"
Hang 'em high and leave 'em for the birds
If I could only kill a word

[Chorus]
So give me sticks, give stones
Bend my body, break my bones
Use staff and rod to turn me black and blue
Cause you can't unhear, you can't unsay
But if were up to me to change
I'd turn "lies" and "hate" to "love" and "truth"
If I could only kill a word
If I could only kill a word

It was the summer before the real world started and
The deal was we would get to go, if we
Cleaned it up, and got it running
Daddy’s old Winnebago

Wing and a prayer down 65
Five best friends on four bald tires
I can still see Billy smiling
When we finally made it

To Talladega
Boys raised up
Whiskey in your glass
Here’s to turning up
Slowing down
And cars that go real fast

We were laughing and living, drinking and wishing
And thinking as that checkered flag was waving
Sure would like to stay in
Talladega

Like a storm, time rolls on
You can’t hit pause, that's just the deal
Most days in life don’t stand out
But life’s about those days that we all like

Rocking Randall
Getting rowdy
Shooting roman candles at the man in the moon
‘til the Alabama sun was breaking

Over Talladega
Boys raised up
Whiskey in your glass
Here’s to turning up
Slowing down
And cars that go real fast

We were laughing and living, drinking and wishing
And thinking as that checked flag was waving
Sure would like to stay in
Talladega

When the winds go cold
And it blows October
I think about us shoulder to shoulder
Like those cars my thoughts roll over and over and over
In my mind

Tonight I’m in Talladega
Boys raised up
Whiskey in your glass
Here’s to turning up
Slowing down
And cars that go real fast

We were laughing and living, drinking and wishing
And thinking as that checked flag was waving
Sure would like to stay in
Talladega

Talladega
Talladega

[Intro]
Boo, boo, boo-boo-boo-boo-boo
Boo, boo, boo-boo-boo-boo-boo
Boo, boo, boo-boo-boo-boo-boo

[Verse 1]
I've seen the Joshua Tree
Got down on my knees
Threw the Virgin Mother a prayer
I've walked glass barefooted
Strolled 'cross the devil's hot coal
I've tried everything, I swear

[Chorus]
Oh, but hey (hey) what can I say?
I'm a desperate man
I said hey (hey) what can I say?
I'm just a desperate man

[Post-Chorus]
Boo, boo, boo-boo-boo-boo-boo
Boo, boo, boo-boo-boo-boo-boo
Boo, boo, boo-boo-boo-boo-boo

[Verse 2]
Fortuneteller told me
"No more last chances
You got no future at all"
Oh, but I ain't listenin'
You black-hearted gypsy
With a crucifix through her bedroom wall

[Chorus]
Hey (hey) what can I say?
I'm a desperate man
I said hey (hey) what can I say?
I'm just a desperate man

[Post-Chorus]
Oh, yeah
Boo, boo, boo-boo-boo-boo-boo
Boo, boo, boo-boo-boo-boo-boo
Boo, boo, boo-boo-boo-boo-boo
Boo, boo, boo-boo-boo-boo-boo
Boo, boo, boo-boo-boo-boo-boo
Boo, boo, boo-boo-boo-boo-boo

[Bridge]
Yeah, I'm a half-cock, full-tilt, scarred-hands-to-the-hilt
Don't-push-me grown-ass man
Yeah, flashin' light caution, careful where ya cross son
'Til she comes back again

[Chorus]
Yeah, hey (hey) what can I say?
I'm a desperate man
Oh, hey (hey) what can I say?
I'm just a desperate man
Oh, hey (hey) I said hey (hey)
Woah, what can I say? I'm a desperate man
Oh, hey (hey) I said hey (hey)
I'm just a desperate man

[Post-Chorus]
Oh, yeah
Boo, boo, boo-boo-boo-boo-boo
Boo, boo, boo-boo-boo-boo-boo
Boo, boo, boo-boo-boo-boo-boo
Grown-ass man
Boo, boo, boo-boo-boo-boo-boo
Boo, boo, boo-boo-boo-boo-boo
Boo, boo, boo-boo-boo-boo-boo

[Outro]
Boo, boo, boo-boo-boo-boo-boo
Boo, boo, boo-boo-boo-boo-boo
Boo, boo, boo-boo-boo-boo-boo

[Verse 1]
Yeah, I'd give this last wrinkled dollar
In my pocket that I earned
With a hammer and vice
If I could undo some things
And grow me some wings
Fly out of this quarter tonight

[Verse 2]
Yeah, tonight, every man with a TV
Is seeing a man with my clothes and my face
In the last thirty minutes
I've gone from a person of interest
To a full-blown manhunt underway

[Pre-Chorus]
I did what I did
I have no regrets
When you cross the line
You get what you get

[Chorus]
Tonight, a bleeding memory
Is tomorrow's guilty vein
Your auburn hair on a faraway sea wall
Screams across the Pontchartrain
I'm haunted by headlights
And a crescent city breeze
One wrong turn on Bourbon
Cuts like the knives of New Orleans

[Verse 3]
I'm a ghost dodging bullets
In all of these alleys
Just looking for my getaway keys
Wrapped up in the night
Hiding out in plain sight
But this grip's getting tight around me

[Pre-Chorus]
Ain't no getting out
That I can see
They'll take me dead
If they ever take me

[Chorus]
Tonight, a bleeding memory
Is tomorrow's guilty vein
Your auburn hair on a faraway sea wall
Screams across the Pontchartrain
I'm haunted by headlights
And a crescent city breeze
One wrong turn on Bourbon
Cuts like the knives of New Orleans
Of New Orleans

[Bridge]
What I wouldn't do
For just one more kiss
I'm all out of time
Honey, it's come down to this

[Chorus]
I'm haunted by your hazel eyes
And this crescent city breeze
One wrong turn on Bourbon
Cuts like the knives of New Orleans

[Outro]
I did what I did
I did what I did
I did what I did
I did what I did

[Verse 1]
Rattlesnake said to the copperhead
"You give us vipers a real bad name"
You prey on the weakest, fight for no reason
No wonder we get blamed"
Copperhead laughed, said, "Kiss my ass!
You can bark but there ain't much bite
You rattle that tail, but it's fear I smell
I think you're shaking out of fright"

[Chorus]
Rattlesnake, copperhead
Either one of them'll kill you dead
We stay hungry, they get fed
And don't pass the plate around
Lie by lie, cheat by cheat
Venom in smiling teeth
They just run those forked tongues
And the whole world's burning down

[Post-Chorus]
Wow! Wow! Wow!

[Verse 2]
Copperhead said to the rattlesnake
"If you ever wanna make it rain
We could team up, be twice as tough
Fear will be our game"
Rattlesnake said to the copperhead
"Y'know we were the original sin
And I bet you my rattle against your copper
That the bitch takes the apple again"

[Chorus]
Rattlesnake, copperhead
Either one of them'll kill you dead
We stay hungry, they get fed
And don't pass the plate around
Lie by lie, cheat by cheat
Venom in smiling teeth
They just run those forked tongues
And the whole world's burning down

[Post-Chorus]
Wow! Wow! Wow!

[Outro]
Rattlesnake said to the copperhead
"Ain't no way they'd win
'Cause the mice are sheep and the shepherd's asleep"
And the copperhead said, "Amen"

[Verse 1]
Why you with your long brown hair flowing
And you with your fresh tattooed skin
And you from the Western Virginia
That you'll never get to see again
As darkness descended the desert
And a bad actor starred in his play
Why you from Tennessee did life capture
And me from Tennessee get away

[Chorus]
And when the morning sun hit the mountain
And a glorious still calmed the breeze
I asked the God of all knowing wisdom
Why you and why not me?

[Verse 2]
Yeah the lord is my refuge and fortress
My God with whom I trust
But I'll never know why the wicked
Gets to prey on the best of us
Why you full of life and promise
At the top of your lungs so loud
My songs that you sang so sweetly will ring
In my ears forever now

[Chorus]
And when the morning sun hits the mountain
And a glorious still calms the breeze
I'll ask the God of infinite wisdom
Why you and why not me?

[Outro]
And every morning when the sun hits the mountain
And a glorious still calms the breeze
I'll ask the God of my salvation
Why you and why not me?
Why you and why not me?

[Verse 1]
My daddy had a Pontiac on the beige-er side of yellow
He was a young man then and I was a little fella
I'd play in that bench back seat and listen to the songs get sung
He couldn't carry a tune in a bucket but he'd sing at the top of his lungs

[Chorus 1]
"Carry On My Wayward Son" on the hippie radio
Songs about the flower babies and the birth of rock and roll
And I was the band, and I would stand and we'd bounce down the road
A boy and his dad in a Pontiac and a hippie radio

[Verse 2]
Can't' remember if it was seventeen, maybe eighteen is right
But I'll never forget those baby blues in the glow of that dashboard light
I'd won her heart the week before and it was hot right from the start
I busted her brother Billy's mouth for makin' fun of my car

[Chorus 2]
It was "White Wedding" and "Rebel Yell" on the hippie radio
I was a "Werewolf in London," and she was "Lady Marmalade"'s soul
And I'd crank the band, take her hand and we'd pull off back a road
A boy and his girl in a Pontiac, and a hippie radio

[Verse 3]
Four years and seven days from tying cans to the bumper
I was pacing a maternity floor, my flower baby was a mother
My hands were shaking as we were leaving, taking our boy home
My heart was full and in my head I could hear a long, long song

[Chorus 3]
Cat's in the cradle and the silver spoon on the hippie radio
A-B-C, 1-2-3, don't blink or he'll be gone
And I took her hand and she just smiled with a look that said, "I know"
A boy and his dad and a boy and his girl and a Pontiac
And a hippie radio

[Verse 1]
Two miles east of the Chickamauga
Just over the hill and across the holla
End of the path leading from the water
There's a one-room, A-frame house
Hot-pie, potbelly stove
When she workin' the flame, it never get cold
The only place on Earth I know
It gets hotter when the sun goes down

[Chorus]
Oh my, my Chattanooga Lucy
Woman, what it is you do to me
Forbidden fruit, it sure is juicy
You got me comin' around, comin' around
Oh my, my Chattanooga Lucy
Break me easy or bend me bluesy
Hold on tight or hold on loosely
Keep me comin' around, comin' around

[Verse 2]
Post my bail and pay my bounty
Anything to get me down to Hamilton County
Up and down and all around me
Every time I hear the sound
Every time I hear the sound

[Chorus]
Oh my, my Chattanooga Lucy
Woman, what it is you do to me
Forbidden fruit, it sure is juicy
You got me comin' around, comin' around
Oh my, my Chattanooga Lucy
Bend me easy or break me bluesy
Hold on tight or hold on loosely
Keep me comin' around, comin' around

[Bridge]
Yeah, I come undone
Every time I get some
Kickdrum, guitar strum
No matter where you come from

[Chorus]
Oh my, my Chattanooga Lucy
Woman, what it is you do to me
Forbidden fruit, it sure is juicy
You got me comin' around, comin' around
Oh my, my Chattanooga Lucy
Break me easy or bend me bluesy
Hold on tight or hold on loosely
Keep me comin' around, comin' around
Keep me comin' around, comin' around

[Outro]
Yeah, I come undone
Every time I get some
Kickdrum, guitar strum
She's everything but a shy one

[Verse 1]
And I don't own nothin' new
I might look like a mess to you
But I'm solid

[Verse 2]
This ol' thing I drive around
Got some rust, makes some funny sounds
But it's paid for and solid

[Verse 3]
You may think I'm way too chill
But I get it done, got my daddy's will
And I'll always, I'll always keep a promise

[Chorus]
In a great big world, spinnin' around
People walkin' around on shaky ground
My foundation's solid
Like a vessel gettin' tossed on the big blue sea
Tryin' to rock me off my feet
It's you that keeps me solid

[Verse 4]
Everybody wants me to think like they do
Put my faith in somethin' new
But this old school is tried and true, it's solid

[Verse 5]
Got these 501's back in '93
Yeah, the blue's all gone, you can see my knees
But to me, man, they're still solid

[Verse 6]
This old scarred-up piece of wood
Sounds a lot better than it looks
I can't count the nights that it's caught me when I was fallin'

[Chorus]
In a great big world, spinnin' around
People walkin' around on shaky ground
My foundation's solid
Like a vessel gettin' tossed on the big blue sea
Tryin' to knock me off my feet
It's you that keeps me solid

[Outro]
It's been a lotta years since I've taken this road home
It's still not paved, Mama and Daddy's gone
But the gravel in my soul is solid

[Verse 1]
Don't tell me about no beach
Don't wanna hear about your mountain
How the good life is a peach
You drink your sunsets from a fountain
No, I don't wanna think about it
Save your breath, I don't wanna hear about it

[Chorus]
I just wanna get right down at the fire light
Let my baby sing, "Hold me tight
You honky tonk nighttime man"
Drink away this crazy world
Hold tight to a longneck-holdin' girl
Won't you give it all boys? The fed-up give a damn
Bartender, here's a fifty
Pour some whiskey on this drowning man

[Verse 2]
We put the smoke in the stack
Put the seed in the ground
While Lady Liberty turns her back
And Uncle Sam just turns around
No, I don't wanna think about it
Oh, tonight I don't wanna think about it

[Chorus]
I just wanna get right down at the fire light
Let my baby sing, "Hold me tight
You honky tonk nighttime man"
Drink away this crazy world
Hold tight to a longneck-holdin' girl
Won't you give it all boys? The fed-up give a damn
Bartender, if you're with me
Pour some whiskey on this drowning man

[Instrumental]

[Chorus]
I just wanna get right down at the fire light
Let my baby sing, "Hold me tight
You honky tonk nighttime man"
Drink away this crazy world
Hold tight to a longneck-holdin' girl
Won't you give it all boys? The fed-up give a damn
Bartender, if you're with me
Pour some whiskey on this drowning man

[Outro]
Don't tell me about no beach
Don't wanna hear about your mountain
How the good life is a peach
Drink your sunsets from a fountain
No, I don't wanna hear about it
Save your breath, I don't wanna hear about it

[Verse 1]
I'm a long-gone Waylon song on vinyl
I'm a back row sinner at a tent revival
But she believes in me like she believes her Bible
And loves me like Jesus does

[Verse 2]
I'm a lead foot leaning on a souped-up Chevy
I'm a good old boy, drinking whiskey and rye on the levee
But she carries me when my sins make me heavy
And loves me like Jesus does

[Chorus]
All the crazy in my dreams
Both my broken wings
Every single piece of everything I am
Yeah, she knows the man I ain't
She forgives me when I can't
The devil, man, no, he don't stand a chance
Cause she loves me like Jesus does

[Verse 3]
I always thought she'd give up on me one day
Wash her hands of me, leave me staring down some runway
But I thank God each night, and twice on Sunday
That she loves me like Jesus does

[Chorus]

[Outro]
Yes, she knows the man I ain't
She forgives me when I can't
That devil, man, he don't stand a chance
She loves me like Jesus does
I'm a long-gone Waylon song on vinyl

[Verse 1]
Always been a fighter, scrapper, and a clawer
Used up some luck in lawyers
Like Huck from Tom Sawyer jumped on my raft
And shoved off chasing my dreams
Reeling in big fishes
I had some hits, and a few big misses
I gave 'em hell and got a few stitches
And these days, I show off my scars

[Chorus]
With one arm around my baby
And one arm around my boys
A heart that's still pretty crazy
And a head that hates the noise
If the world comes knocking
Tell 'em I'm not home
I'm finally holdin' my own

[Verse 2]
I've burned up the fast lane
Dodging drugs and divorce
If I'm proof of anything
God sure loves Troubadour
Sometimes, late at night
I miss the smoke and neon
Sneak out of bed, grab a six-string
Play what's still turnin' me on
Like that tight old-time rock and roll
Or that right-down-home country gold
I miss blues and soul
But not more than I miss being home

[Chorus]
With one arm around my baby
And one arm around my boys
A heart that's still pretty crazy
And a head that got sick of noise
If the world comes knocking
Tell 'em I'm not home
I'm finally holdin' my own

[Bridge]
'Til I run out of time
I'm gonna spend the rest of mine

[Chorus]
With one arm around my baby
And one arm around my boys
A heart that's still pretty crazy
And a head that just got sick of noise
If the world comes knocking
Tell 'em I'm not home
I'm finally holdin' my own

[Outro]
And when my time on Earth is done
I want they write it on my stone
I lived, loved, and died holdin' my own
I lived, loved, and died holdin' my own

[Verse 1]
I still remember Miss Bessie singing
Black, wrinkled fingers on ivory keys
Just five years old, my church shoes a-dangling
Yeah, she's long gone and I'm still chasing this song

[Chorus]
With a guitar full of freedom and a head full of lines
That nightlife full of demons has been a hell of a ride
I got a crazy heart, but I was born to lose it
Married to a dream with a mistress named music

[Verse 2]
No hope and squarely solitary
Enough whiskey and Coke, boys, to get me in a bind
Amps juiced, the whole damn block could hear me
Even that cop car rolling past
By the time they hit the front door
I was out the back

[Chorus]
With a guitar full of freedom and a head full of lines
That nightlife full of demons has been a hell of a ride
I got a crazy heart, and I was born to lose it
Married to a dream with a mistress named music

[Verse 3]
White calloused fingers on bronze and nylon
These same old boots are still tapping time
Not quite the buzz I used to tie on
But 'til I'm gone, I'll be chasing this song

[Chorus]
With a guitar full of freedom and a head full of lines
That nightlife full of demons has been a hell of a ride
I got a crazy heart, and I was born to lose it
Married to a dream with a mistress named music
Yeah, I'm married to a dream with a mistress named music

[Verse 1]
They can make cars drive themselves
And prove time-travel ain't crazy as hell
They've even got a pill to make a soft package hard
But as far as we've came
When it comes to love and to blame
And the breaking of a loved heart
I think we're sorely lacking methods
So I'm going with old time-tested
A jukebox and a bar

[Chorus]
One pushes me up the mountain
And one rolls me down the hill
While I sit in a phosphorescent dark
So you can keep your fancy potions
And your incandescent notions
As for me and my barely-beating heart
There's no better prescription
For my broken disposition
Than a jukebox and a bar

[Verse 2]
We got pinpoint GPS
All you need is an address
But her love is the one thing I can't find
Meanwhile no one has a clue
How to make her memory turn loose
So much for academic minds

[Chorus]
One pushes me up the mountain
And one rolls me down the hill
While I sit here in a phosphorescent dark
So you can keep your fancy potions
And your incandescent notions
As for me and my barely-beating heart
There's no better prescription
For the human condition
Than a jukebox and a bar

[Outro]
May look like music, booze, and beer
There's a whole more goin' on in here
Than a jukebox and a bar

[Verse 1]
Damn, I used to love this view
Sit here and drink a few
Main street and the high school lit up on Friday night
Down there it's another touchdown
Man, this year's team is stout
I can hear them going crazy
And up here so am I
Thinking about you sitting there saying I hate this, I hate it
If you couldn't stand living here why'd you take it, take it

[Chorus]
Give me back my hometown
Cause this is my hometown

[Verse 2]
All the colors of my youth
The red, the green, the hope, the truth
Are beating me black and blue cause you're in every scene
My friends try to cheer me up, get together at the Pizza Hut
I didn't have the heart to tell them that was our place
These sleepy streetlights on every sidewalk side street
Shed a light on everything that used to be

[Chorus]
Give me back my hometown
Cause this is my hometown
Yeah, yeah, oh, yeah, yeah

[Verse 3]
You can have my grandma's locket
The knife out of my grandpa's pocket
Yeah my state champion jacket
I don't care you can have it
Every made memory
Every picture, every broken dream
Yeah everything, everything, everything

[Chorus]
Give me back my hometown
Cause this is my hometown
Yeah, yeah, oh, yeah, yeah

[Verse 1]
There's a cabin in a valley
My grandpa built on your land
Your mountains are a canvas
For the makers hand
Tonight I'm fishing Elk River
If only in my mind
No, I haven't seen her banks in such a long, long time
I carry you in my heart
Your memory comes over me like the dark and

[Chorus]
Like a phone call from my baby
Saying' honey I miss ya like crazy
Like the sound of a siren song
Oh Carolina, ya keep calling me home
Calling' me home

[Verse 2]
Sometimes I grow weary
From going' all the time
I love to take a minute
Let you ease my mind
I'd love to see my mama
Maybe go for a drive
But I got to play the star in some little town again tonight
Don't get me wrong
I love what I do
It's just another song about missing you

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
Calling me home[x3]
Oh, oh, we're almost home

[Chorus]
Like a phone call from my baby
Saying honey I miss ya, I miss ya like crazy
Just like the song of a siren song

Oh Carolina
Carolina[x2]
Keep calling me home
Calling me home[x3]
Carolina[x2]
Keep calling me home

[Verse 1]
You were too bad for a little square town
With your hip-hop hat and your pants on the ground
Heard you cussed out mamma, pushed daddy around
Before you took off in his car
Here you are runnin' these dirty old streets
Tattoo on your neck, fake gold on your teeth
Got the hood here snowed, but you can't fool me
We both know who you are

[Chorus]
Homeboy you're gonna wish one day you were sittin' on the gate of a truck by the lake
With your high school flame on one side
Ice cold beer on the other
Ain't no shame in a blue collar forty
Little house little kids little small town story
If you don't ever do anything else for me
Just do this for me brother
Come on home, boy

[Verse 2]
I was haulin' this hay, to Uncle Joe's farm
I thought of us bare foot kids in the yard
Man it seems we were just catchin' snakes in the barn
Now you're caught up in this mess
I can use a little help unloadin' these bales
I can keep ya pretty busy with a hammer and a nail
Ain't a glamorous life, but it'll keep you outta jail
And not worry us all to death

[Chorus]
Homeboy you're gonna wish one day you were sittin' on the gate of a truck by the lake
With your high school flame on one side
Ice cold beer on the other
Ain't no shame in a blue collar forty
Little house little kids little small town story
If you don't ever do anything else for me
Just do this for me brother
Come on home, boy
Come on home, boy

[Bridge]
Homeboy... Yeah...
You can't hold back the hands of time
Mamas goin' grey and so is Daddy's mind
I wish you'd come on back and make it all right
Before they're called...home, boy

[Outro]
Homeboy
Come on home, boy
Homeboy
Come on home, boy

[Verse 1]
How you spin, hit the door, and get myself on down the road
I picked my clothes up off the floor and on the wind I go
Let it blow me where the wild is, thought I was off better
Holding on to nothing, but they're holding me together

[Chorus]
Look at me hangin' around
Hangin' around
Hangin' around (Ooh)
Hangin' around (Ooh)

[Post-Chorus]
Make me sweat, sweat
Breaking out a fever, I get cranky
So hot, hot
Damn hot, shakes it, I get shake, shake

[Verse 3]
I rock to my own rhythm (I rock)
I roll to my own beat (I, I, I roll)
I play the movie villain
Now you got me playing for keeps

[Chorus]
Hangin' around (Ooh)
Hangin' around
Hangin' around (Ooh)
Hangin' around (Ooh)
(Help me)

[Post-Chorus]
Make me sweat, sweat
Breaking out a fever, I get cranky
Get so hot, hot
Damn hot, shake it like you shake, shake

[Verse 5]
Strangest change of places (I rock)
We're just scared today (I, I, I roll)
She's the one holding my aces
And I'm the one holding my breath

[Chorus]
Hangin' around (Ooh, yeah)
Hangin' around (Ooh)
Hangin' around (Ooh, ooh)
Hangin' around (Ooh)
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah (Ooh)
(Ooh)

[Verse 1: Eric Church]
There's a little dive on a dead-end road
Called the Cross-Eyed Cricket Watering' Hole
Where you can hear the sound of a steel guitar
An' get loud an' rowdy on PBR
But at the top of every hour, man, you can hear a pin drop
As ol' Jack drops a quarter an' plays Merle on that jukebox, an' we stop

[Chorus: Eric Church]
An' tip our hats
An' raise our glasses of cold, cold beer
They say country's fading
But we still wavin' that flag around here
An' when it's time to go, you know you're welcome back
Where the people pledge allegiance to the Hag

[Verse 2: Eric Church]
When the weekend comes an' the weather's clear
There's a high spot fifteen miles from here
Where you can always find a few dusty trucks
With the windows down an' the radio up
We sit there poppin' tops, shootin' bull an' singin' songs
But you can bet your boots that when Haggard comes on

[Chorus: Eric Church]
We tip our hats
And raise our glasses of cold, cold beer
They say country's fading
But we still wavin' that flag around here
And when it's time to go, you know you're welcome back
Where the people pledge allegiance to the Hag

[Verse 3: Merle Haggard]
One of these days when my time has come
You can take me back to where I'm from
Put me on a westbound train
An' ship me off in the pouring' rain

[Pre-Chorus: Eric Church]
Don't cry for me when I'm gone
Just put a quarter in the jukebox an' sing me back home

[Verse 4: Eric Church]
An' tip our hats
An' raise our glasses of cold, cold beer
They say country's fading'
But just keep waving' that flag around here
An' I know, it'll keep on coming' back
Long as people pledge allegiance
Where folks still pledge allegiance
I pledge allegiance to the Hag

[Verse 1]
I was fifteen when my daddy's old man
Caught me half way through my first beer
He laughed so hard when my face turned green
He said “You come from a long line of sinners like me”
Now me and my brother go to see him some times
But he don't have much to say anymore
So we sit on his headstone with a fifth of Jack D
Here's to a long line of sinners like me

[Chorus]
La de dah de dah
La de dah dah de de
I come from a long line of sinners like me

[Verse 2]
My mama had a soft spot for a hell raisin' boy
So she had two more just like him
It takes an angel to raise a family
That comes from a long line of sinners like me
Well now maybe who knows one day I'll settle down
Give my dad a grandson of his own
And when the doctor smacks him, he'll probably take a swing
Because he'll come from a long line of sinners like me

[Chorus]
La de dah de dah
La de dah dah de de
I come from a long line of sinners like me

[Verse 3]
On the day I die
I know where I'm going to go
Me and Jesus got that part worked out
I'll wait at the gates til his face I see
And stand in a long line of sinners like me
I'll stand in a long line of sinners like me

[Chorus]
La de dah de dah
La de dah dah de de
I come from a long line of sinners like me
La de dah de dah
La de dah dah de de
Here’s to a long line of sinners like me
I come from a long line of sinners like me

[Verse 1]
Early monday morning to friday at five
Man I work work work but I don't climb climb climb
Boss man can shove that over time up his can
All I wanna do is put a drink in my hand

[Chorus 1]
To fill it up or throw it down
I got a forty hour week worth of trouble to drown
No need to complicate it, I'm a simple man
All you got to do is put a drink in my hand

[Verse 2]
Yeah the parking lot is muddy, can't get to the door
I take my jacked up drop er down in 4x4
She'll down a long neck, warm up the band
All you got to do is put a drink in my hand

[Chorus 2]
To fill it up or throw it down
I'm about to tear a new one in this old town
5 4 3 2 1 I'll be your rocket man
All you got to do is put a drink in my hand

[Verse 3]
You make me want to go ouuh ouhhh when you dance like that
You got that little tattoo playing peaky boo on your back
If you want to impress me baby here's my plan
All you got to do is put a drink in my hand

[Chorus 3]
To fill it up or throw it down
When you drive me home take the long way around
You be my Lois Lane I'll be your Superman
All you got to do is put a drink in my hand

[Verse 4]
My head monday morning as that alarm clock sings
It goes bang bang bang while it ring ring rings
Yeah I'm ready to roll if you wanna rock again
All you got to do is put a drink in my hand

Yeah I'm ready to roll
If you want to rock again
All you got to do is put a drink in my hand

Damn right I'm ready to roll
If you want to rock again
All you got to do is put a drink in my hand

Yeah I'm ready to roll
If you want to rock again
All you got to do is put a drink in my hand

[Chorus 4]
To fill it up or throw it down
I got a little hangover still hanging around
Yeah that hair of a dog is saying hey there man
All you got to do is put a drink in my hand

[Outro]
Yea that hair of a dog is howling hey there man
All you got to do is put a drink in my hand
Haaaouuhhh Yeaaa

[Verse 1]
I like fast cars and sharp dreams
Chased a lot of crazy things
Left behind my share of broken pieces
This morning I turned 36
When you just remember half of it
You wonder how you outlived Hank and Jesus

[Chorus]
I put the rage in a river, the roll in a thunder
But you kept me from goin' under
When that current got too heavy
I always thought I'd be a heap of metal
In a cloud of smoke, foot stuck to the pedal
Sold for parts like a junkyard rusted-out Chevy
Fear, I've had none
What the hell made you wanna love
A man who was gonna die young

[Verse 2]
In the mirror I saw my surprise
Who knew gray hairs liked to hide on a head
That didn't think he'd live past thirty
If I make it thirty more
It's the brown that you'll be looking for
As you run your fingers through it and say
"Slow down, honey."

[Chorus]
I put the rage in a river, the roll in a thunder
But you kept me from goin' under
When that current got too heavy
I always thought I'd be a heap of metal
In a cloud of smoke, foot stuck to the pedal
Sold for parts like a junkyard rusted-out Chevy
Fear, I've had none
What the hell made you wanna love
A man who was gonna die young

[Verse 3]
Call it intuition, or call it crazy
Just thought by now I'd be pushing up daisies
But I'll gladly stick around if we're together
So baby, when you bow your head tonight
Could you tell the Lord I've changed my mind?
And with you I'd like to live forever

(Princess of Darkness) Prelude:

This town, she is a temptress
A siren with gold eyes, she'll cut you with her kindness
She will lead you with her lies
She's been called a glistening meadow
She's good at keeping score
If you make it she's your savior, if you don't she's a whore
The roads to and from her heart are littered with creative souls
They gave all of their all and all they got in return is empty holes
Sure we've all heard about Shell, and Chris, Willy, and the Bobby Bares
She'd smiled on the Johnny's, the Merles and the many music-row billionaires
Like a beacon she goes seeking seed, her loins so fertile
To a free man she's a prison, to a caged one she's a fire

She's the reason there's a Sunday morning coming down
I saw the light, A Boy Named Sue, He stopped loving her today
The pill and 16th avenue
The Ryman, oh she's a diamond the brown eyed mickey
She was Roy Acuffs castle and Elvis Presley's broken dream
It's not all bad it's not all dark it's not all gloom and crass
But to mine gold in this silver mine it does take balls of brass
For she's seem 'em come and seen 'em go
And came herself a time or two. no matter
How satisfied her scream sounds she always wants someone new
The next him or her or them or all... With stamina to last the night. To be a star in this lady's town...
You can f*** or you can fight

You see, it all comes down to money
Not romantic art of days gone past, if you forget that rule
You can bet your backside she will bury it in your ass
A tramp, a slut, a bitch, a mutt, a thousand pawn shop guitars
A nasty little needle to a vein that feeds a singers heart
She lurks in friendly shadows; but she's a junky with a limp
The agents are her bookie and the labels are her pimp
I'll tell you a well-known secret of a place known far and wide
The devil walks among us folks and Nashville is his bride

All the chaos he has caused, and done
His greatest trick is to every guitar-totin' dreamer
The devil don't exist... but me, I shook his hand
And I know that he is real
So devil, you can go screw yourself, and then go straight to hell

THE SONG: (Devil, Devil)

Devil, devil, I feel you preying on my mind
Got nine things going wrong right now
And her leaving makes a dime
I’m mad as hell, and drunk, and well
Tonight, I guess we’ll see
If devil, devil, you’re bad enough to lock horns with me

Level, level, in search of solid ground
This swinging, swaying, side to side, is tossing me around
I got a hanker for an anchor to steady up my bow
Level, level, tie this rebel down

Crazy, crazy, calling out my name
I got one foot on the platform and the other’s on a train
Save me, save me, I know what’s in store
Crazy, crazy hell, I’ve been there before

Danger, danger, the way you’re looking there at me
Be careful what you wish for, you might get what you don’t need
I’m a brush fire on a drought land in a Santa Ana breeze
Danger, danger, don’t you play around with me

Crazy, crazy, calling out my name
I got one foot on the platform and the other’s on a train
Save me, save me, I know what’s in store
Crazy, crazy hell, I’ve been there before

Angel, angel, heavenly body in holy jeans
On second thought, get over here and wrap me in your wings
Throw caution to the wind and honey, give me what I need
Angel, angel, love this devil, devil, out of me
Devil, devil, devil

Oooooo, devil, devil
Oooooo, devil, devil
Oooooo, devil, devil

[Instrumental]
[Verse 1]
Turn the quiet up, turn the noise down
Let this ol' world just spin around
I wanna feel it swing, wanna feel it sway
And put some feel good in my soul
Drink a little drink, smoke a little smoke

Want a little more right, and a little less left
Little more right now, a little less what's next
Act like tomorrow's ten years away
And just kick back and let the feelin' flow
Drink a little drink, smoke a little smoke

[Verse 2]
I set my sails for a new direction
But the wind got in my way
I changed my course
But my definition of change
Just ain't the same

I'm gonna sit right here
Stay away from there
I'm gonna make pretend
I just don't care
And I could get up
Go get her back
Or maybe I'll just let her go
Drink a little drink, smoke a little smoke
(ah come on now)
Go get her back (ohhh)
Drink a little drink, smoke a little smoke
Drink a little drink smoke a little, smoke
(You guys put your hands together like this)

[Bridge]
Kick back, gives the blues a spin
Break out the wine, forget again
Dig down deep, find my stash
Light it up, take me back

[Bridge]
Kick back, gives the blues a spin
Break out the wine, forget again
Dig down deep, find my stash
Light it up, memory crash

[Outro]
Oh no, I don’t know
Baby, it might take, all night
Then I’ll maybe break out that old rock and roll
Drink a little drink, smoke a little smoke

(Lets all stay out here and..)
Drink a little drink, smoke a little smoke
[Instrumental]

[Verse 1]
I got a reputation going round
Ain't never been the kind to back down
I’ve thrown a punch or two and gave a few black eyes
But Jack Daniels kicked my ass again last night
I hung in pretty good for a round or two
But he don’t fight fair like daddy taught me to
Her memory turned my head
And then he snuck up from behind
Yeah, Jack Daniels kicked my ass again last night

[Chorus]
Always thought this heart was made of steel and bulletproof
But the memory of her taillights fading breaks it right in two
Guess every superman has got his kryptonite
Jack Daniels kicked my ass again last night

[Verse 2]
Well I didn’t bleed and I ain't black and blue
But it ain't hard to tell who got the better of who
Cause in the morning light I’m hard to recognize
Yeah Jack Daniels kicked my ass again last night

[Chorus]
Always thought this heart was made of steel and bulletproof
But the memory of her taillights fading breaks it right in two
Guess every superman has got his kryptonite
Jack Daniels kicked my ass again last night
Come on grab the wind

[Outro]
That black label’s like black powder for my soul
My head feels like a bomb about to blow
But hell I’m half inclined to give that fuse a light
And let Jack Daniels kick my ass again tonight
It's got a new tonight

[Chorus]
It's over when it's over
Ain't it, baby, ain't it?
Rips ya like a dagger
Can't it baby, Can't it
Wish we could do it over
Damn it, baby, Damn it
We had it in the air, we just couldn't land it

[Verse 1]
It's the first snap of the last straw
Where regrets outlast the alcohol
It's a cold sweat, in an empty bed
And dreams are like a knife
When you're hanging by a thread
Ain't no "Maybe we can make it if we just play the right cards"

[Chorus]
It's over when it's over
Ain't it, baby, ain't it?
Rips ya like a dagger
Can't it baby, Can't it
Wish we could do it over
Damn it, baby, Damn it
We had it in the air, we just couldn't land it

[Verse 2]
It's a white flag
It's a stop sign
It's the last long drag, on a Marlboro light
It's a long night, beating up the past
Know when the first lie, is going to hit you back
This ain't no gone for good drill
Or no goodbye false alarm, it's over
Yeah it's over[x2]

There ain't no better way
We could make it work
It's a blank page
When you're outta words
Yeah it's a flat line
It's a heart attack
Yeah it's too far gone, to be shocked back
It's a one way, with nowhere to turn
It's a no brakes, baby, crash and burn
Ain't no map going to ever bring us back
From where we are

[Chorus]
It's over when it's over
Ain't it, baby, ain't it?
Rips ya like a dagger
Can't it baby, Can't it
Wish we could do it over
Damn it, baby, Damn it
We had it in the air, we just couldn't land it

It ain’t a needle in a vein
It ain’t backstage sex
It ain’t lines of cocaine on a private jet
It ain’t havin’ a posse full of hangers on following you around
It ain’t long hair, tattoos, playin’ too loud
(No)

It ain’t a middle finger on a t-shirt
The establishments tryin’ to sell
It’s a guy with the balls who told the establishment
To go to hell
It ain’t about the money you make, when a record gets sold
It’s about doin’ it for nothin’, cause it lives in your soul

That’s damn rock and roll
That’s damn rock and roll

It’s a rock through a window
It’s a riot in the street
It’s a rebel revolution
It’s fightin’ for pieces
Burn baby burn
It’s a brick in the wall
It’s the first one to stand
And the last one to fall
It’s a hip shaking devil on the stage in Tupelo
It’s doing what ya want instead of doin’ what your told
It’s a preacher burning records, tellin’ folks they oughta pray
Cause the shepherd bought a Gibson, and led the flock astray

That’s damn rock and roll
Give all ya got ‘till there ain’t nothin’ left
That’s damn rock and roll

The Clash crashed the party
And the party got loud
And the party turned into an angry crowd
Drowning demons feel no pain
Found Nirvana wasted shame
Gone too soon just like a song
Hendrix, Joplin. What went wrong?
Need some answers right or wrong
Need something to blame it on
(Blame it on)
(Blame it on)
(Blame it on)
(Blame it on)
(Blame it on)
(Blame it on)
(Blame it on)
(Blame it on)
(Blame it on)
(Blame it on)

That’s damn rock and roll
(Give all ya got till there ain’t nothing left)
That’s damn rock and roll
(oh)
(oh)
(oh)
(oh)
(oh)
(oh)
(oh)
(oh)
(oh)
(oh)
(oh)
(oh)

Another day in another town
Loadin’ the stage, and the lights, and the sound
Here they come boys
They’ve opened doors
Count us off now Craig
(1, 2, 3, 4)

That’s damn rock and roll
Give all ya got till there ain’t nothin left
That’s damn rock and roll
Gather round ‘till you’ve broken a sweat
That’s damn rock
That’s damn rock and roll
(Rock and roll)
(Rock and roll)
(Rock and roll)
(Rock and roll)
(Rock and roll)

[Verse 1]
They’re the in crowd, we’re the other ones
It’s a different kind of cloth that we’re cut from
We let our colors show, where the numbers ain’t
With the paint where there ain’t supposed to be paint

That’s who we are
That’s how we roll
The Outsiders, The Outsiders

[Verse 2]
Our women get hot, and our leather gets stained
When we saddle up and ride 'em in the pouring rain
We’re the junkyard dogs, we’re the alley cats
Keep the wind at our front, and the hell at our back

[Pre-Chorus]
That’s who we are
We do our talking, walk that walk
Wide open rocking
That’s how we roll

[Chorus]
Our backs to the wall
A band of brothers
Together, alone, the Outsiders
We’re the riders, we’re the ones burning rubber off our tires
Yeah, we’re the fighters, the all-nighters
So fire them up and get a lil higher

Woah-oh-oh
Woah-oh-oh
Woah-oh-oh
Woah-oh-oh

[Verse 3]
We’re the bad news
We’re the young guns
We’re the ones that they told you to run from
Yeah, the player’s going to play, and a haters going to hate
And a regulators born to regulate
When it hits the fan, and it all goes down
And the gloves come off
You’re going to find out just

[Pre-Chorus]
That’s who we are
We do our talking, walk that walk
Wide open rocking
That’s how we roll

[Chorus]
Our backs to the wall
A band of brothers
Together, alone, the Outsiders
We’re the riders, we’re the ones burning rubber off our tires
Yeah, we’re the fighters, the all-nighters
So fire them up and get a lil higher

Woah-oh-oh
Woah-oh-oh
The Outsiders
Woah-oh-oh
Woah-oh-oh
The Outsiders
Woah-oh-oh
Woah-oh-oh
You’re going to know who we are

[Outro]
Woah-oh-oh
Woah-oh-oh
The Outsiders
Woah-oh-oh
Woah-oh-oh

That’s who we are

[Verse 1]
Boy, you're gonna know it all
You'll think you're ten feet tall
And run like you're bulletproof
And total a car or two
Boy, you're gonna hate this town
Wish you could burn it down
That fire in your eyes is 20 counties wide
But boy, you're gonna love 17
And boy, you'll do some stupid things

[Chorus]
You're gonna drive and kiss
And throw a punch
And grow up way too fast
You're gonna drop the ball
Hit the wall
And break some hearts like glass
I know you well, 'cause you're a part of me
And a part of you will always be a boy

[Verse 2]
You're gonna be so stubborn
You get that from your mother
I already see it now, you weren't built for backing down
And boy, there'll be a small town night
And you'll fall for her sky-blue eyes
And when she's in your hands
You'll think you're a man and not a boy
She'll make you lose your mind, boy
She'll be every reason why

[Chorus]
You're gonna drive and kiss
And throw a punch
And grow up way too fast
You're gonna drop the ball
Hit the wall
And break some hearts like glass
I know you will, 'cause you're a part of me
And a part of you will always be...my boy

[Bridge]
It's 3am and I'd do anything to get you back to sleep
And that face will be the same one in the rearview
The day I watch you leave

[Outro]
But boy, you're gonna come back home
You're gonna settle down
But you won't feel the way I'm feelin' now
Til you have a boy
He's gonna know it all
He'll think he's ten feet tall
And run like he's bulletproof
And total a car or two

[Verse 1]
Girl you know I've known you forever
How many nights we hung out together
Same little crowd, little bar, little town
Round this old dance floor
My boys are laughing and tap me on the shoulder
Making a motion like "'Could y'all get any closer?"
They wanna know what's up why I'm still holding ya
Even when the song is over

[Chorus]
There's a rumor going round about me and you
Stirring up our little town the last week or two
So tell me why we even trying to deny this feeling
I feel it, don't you feel it too?
There's a rumor going round, and round, and round
What d'you say we make it true?
We make it true
Oh, we make it true

[Verse 2]
Well I can shut 'em down, tell them all they're crazy
I can do whatever you want me to do, baby
Or you could lay one on me right now
We could really give them something to talk about

[Chorus]
There's a rumor going round about me and you
Stirring up our little town the last week or two
So tell me why we even trying to deny this feeling
I feel it, don't you feel it too?
There's a rumor going round, and round, and round
What d'you say we make it true, baby?

[Bridge]
Oh be honest girl now
Do you want to do this or not?
Should we keep them talking, girl
Or should we just make them stop?

[Chorus]
There's a rumor going round about me and you
Stirring up our little town the last week or two
So tell me why we even trying to deny this feeling
I feel it, and you feel it too
There's a rumor going round, and round, and round
Whatd'you say we make it-
Make it true?
Whatd'you say we make it true?
Come on over here
Let's really give them something to talk about, baby
There's a rumor going round

[Verse 1]
I am insensitive, I have a tendency to
Pay more attention to the things that I need
Sometimes I drink to much, sometimes I test your trust
Sometimes I don't know why you're staying with me

[Chorus]
I'm hard to love, hard to love,  no I don't make it easy
Well I couldn't do it if I stood where you stood
I'm hard to love, hard to love, and you say that you need me
I don't deserve it but I love that you love me good

[Verse 2]
I am a short fuse, I am a wrecking ball
Crashing into your heart like I do
You're like a Sunday morning, full of grace and full of Jesus
I wish that I could be more like you

[Chorus]
I'm hard to love, hard to love, no I don't make it easy
Well I couldn't do it if I stood where you stood
I'm hard to love, hard to love and you say that you need me
I don't deserve it but I love that you love me good
Love me good

[Bridge]
Girl you've given me a million second chances
And I don't ever wanna take you for granted
I'm just a man, I'm just a man

[Chorus]
Hard to love, hard to love, no I don't make it easy
I couldn't do it if I stood where you stood
I'm hard to love, hard to love and you say that you need me
I don't deserve it but I love that you love me
Hard to love, hard to love, no I don't make it easy
I couldn't do it if I stood where you stood
I'm hard to love, hard to love and you say that you need me
I don't deserve it but I love that you love me
Good

[Outro]
You love me good

[Verse 1]
I’ll never settle down
That’s what I always thought
Yeah, I was that kind of man
Just ask anyone

[Chorus]
I don’t dance, But here I am
Spinning you round and round in circles
It Ain’t my style, but I don’t care
I’d do anything with you anywhere
Yes, you got me in the palm of your hand
Cause, I don’t dance

[Verse 2]
Love’s never come my way
I’ve never been this far
Cause you took these two left feet
And waltzed away with my heart

[Chorus]
No, I don’t dance, but here I am
Spinning you round and round in circles
It ain’t my style, but I don’t care
I’d do anything with you anywhere
Yes, you got me in the palm of your hand, girl
Cause, I don’t dance
Ohhh
I don’t dance

Ooh

I don’t dance, but here I am
Spinning you round and round in circles
It ain’t my style, but I don’t care
I’d do anything with you anywhere

I don’t dance, but here I am
Spinning you around and around in circles
It ain’t my style, but I don’t care
I’d do anything with you anywhere
Yeah, you got me in the palm of your hand, girl
Cause, I don’t dance

Oh
No..

Oooh…

[Verse 1]
Eighty-nine cents in the ash tray
Half empty bottle of Gatorade rolling in the floorboard
That dirty Braves cap on the dash
Dog tags hangin’ from the rear view
Old Skoal can, and cowboy boots
And a Go Army shirt folded in the back

[Pre-Chorus]
This thing burns gas like crazy, but that’s alright
People got their ways of copin', oh, and I’ve got mine

[Chorus]
I drive your truck
I roll every window down
And I burn up
Every back road in this town
I find a field, I tear it up
'Til all the pain’s a cloud of dust
Yeah, sometimes
I drive your truck

[Verse 2]
I leave that radio playin'
That same ol' country station where ya left it
Yeah, man I crank it up
And you’d probably punch my arm right now
If you saw this tear rollin’ down on my face
Hey, man I’m tryin’ to be tough

[Pre-Chorus]
And momma asked me this mornin' if I’d been by your grave
But that flag and stone ain’t where I feel you anyway

[Chorus]
I drive your truck
I roll every window down
And I burn up
Every back road in this town
I find a field, I tear it up
'Til all the pain’s a cloud of dust
Yeah, sometimes
I drive your truck

[Bridge]
I’ve cussed, I’ve prayed, I’ve said goodbye
Shook my fist and asked God why
These days when I’m missin' you this much

[Chorus]
I drive your truck
I roll every window down
And I burn up
Every back road in this town
I find a field, I tear it up
'Til all the pain’s a cloud of dust
Yeah, sometimes (Brother, sometimes)
I drive your truck

[Outro]
I drive your truck
I drive your truck
I hope you don’t mind, I hope you don’t mind
I drive your truck

[Verse 1]
There's plenty 'bout me that I don't like
Most mistakes I've made, I made them twice
Sometimes I don't live out the words I say
And I just can't stay out my own way
But my good intentions overflow
Way down deep inside my bones
Though my head's been known to give me hell
This heart of mine is just something else, yeah

[Chorus]
But the best part of me, part of me is you
Is you, is you
Yeah, the best part of me, part of me is you
Is you

[Verse 2]
I got my old man's baby blues
And his daddy's taste for whiskey too
My brother's love for rock 'n' roll
And my momma's southern gospel soul

[Chorus]
But the best part of me, part of me
Is you, is you
Yeah, the best part of me, part of me
Is you

[Bridge]
Something takes over me
Every moment you hold my hand
Hearts beat in time
As the start all align and I understand

[Chorus]
That the best part of me, the best part of me, oh
Yeah the best part of me, part of me
Is you, oh
The best part of me, part of me
Is you
Oh, is you, ooh

They called him crazy when they started out
Said seventeen's too young to know what love's about
They've been together fifty-eight years now
That's crazy

He brought home sixty-seven bucks a week
He bought a little 2 bedroom house on Maple Street
Where she blessed him with six more mouths to feed
Yeah that's crazy

Just ask him how he did it; he'll say pull up a seat
It'll only take a minute, to tell you everything

Be a best friend, tell the truth, and overuse I love you
Go to work, do your best, don't outsmart your common sense
Never let your prayin' knees get lazy
And love like crazy

They called him crazy when he quit his job
Said them home computers, boy they'll never take off
He sold his one man shop to Microsoft
They paid like crazy

Just ask him how he made it, he'll tell you faith and sweat
And the heart of a faithful woman, Who never let him forget

Be a best friend, tell the truth, and overuse I love you
Go to work, do your best, don't outsmart your common sense
Never let your prayin' knees get lazy
And love like crazy

Always treat your woman like a lady
Never get to old to call her baby
Never let your prayin' knees get lazy
And love like crazy

They called him crazy when they started out
They've been together fifty-eight years now
Ain't that crazy?

We're up when the rooster crows
Clock in when the whistle blows
Eight hours ticking slow
And then tomorrow
We'll do it all over again

I'm a member of a blue collar crowd
They can never, no they can't keep us down
If you gotta, gotta label me
Label me 'proud'

I belong to the drinking class
Monday through Friday, man
We bust our backs
If you're one of us
Raise your glass
I belong to the drinking class

We laugh, we cry, we love
Go hard when the going's tough
Push back on push and shove
Knock us down, we'll get back up again and again

I'm a member of a good timing crowd
We get rowdy, we get wild and loud
If you gotta, gotta label me
Label me proud

I belong to the drinking class
Monday through Friday, man
We bust our backs
If you're one of us
Raise your glass
I belong to the drinking class

We all know why we're here
A little fun, a little music
A little whiskey, a little beer
We going to shake off those long week blues
Ladies, break out your dancing shoes
It don't matter what night it is, it's Friday
It's Saturday, it's Sunday
I just wanna hear you say
I just wanna hear you singing
Y'all Sing it with me

We belong to the drinking class
Monday through Friday, man
We bust our backs
If you're one of us
Raise your glass
We belong to the drinking class

[Verse 1]
Girl, I'm glad you called, first heard you talk
Took me a second cause I couldn't hear your drawl
And that don't sound like you
No, that don't sound like you
I know it's been a while, I don't mean to pry
But when I asked you if you're happy I didn't hear a smile
And that don't sound like you
Nah, that ain't the girl I knew you always sounded like

[Chorus]
Truck tires on a gravel road
Laughing at the world, blasting my radio
Cannonballs splashing in the water
Doing whatever whenever you wanted
What did he do?
Because you don't sound like you any more

[Verse 2]
Your pretty brown hair, you always loved it
Guess he didn't like it so you just cut it
And that don't sound like you
Nah, that ain't the girl I knew you always sounded like

[Chorus]
Truck tires on a gravel road
Laughing at the world, blasting my radio
Cannonballs splashing in the water
Doing whatever whenever you wanted
What did he do?
'Cause baby, you don't sound like you any more
Oh, anymore

[Verse 3]
That town, that job, that guy
You can leave them behind, girl, you know you're better than that
If you want to come back, you can come back
Baby, come back to

[Chorus]
Truck tires on a gravel road
Laughing at the world, blasting my radio
Cannonballs splashing in the water
Doing whatever whenever you wanted
What did he do?
Because you don't sound like you any more

[Outro]
Girl, I'm glad you called, first heard you talk
Took me a second cause I couldn't hear your drawl

Last night, outta the blue
Driftin' off to the evening news
She said "Honey, what would you do
If you'd never met me"
I just laughed, said "I don't know
But I could take a couple guesses though"
And then tried to dig real deep
Said, "Darling honestly...

I'd do a lot more offshore fishin'
I'd probably eat more drive-thru chicken
Take a few strokes off my golf game
If I'd have never known your name
I'd still be driving that old green 'Nova
I probably never would have heard of yoga
Be a better football fan
But if I was a single man
Alone and out there on the loose
Well I'd be looking for a woman like you."

I could tell that got her attention
So I said, "Oh yeah, I forgot to mention
I wouldn't trade a single day
For 100 years the other way."
She just smiled and rolled her eyes,
Cause she's heard all of my lines
I said, "C'mon on girl, seriously
If I hadn't been so lucky

I'd be shootin' pool in my bachelor pad
Playing bass in my cover band
Restocking up cold Bud Light
For poker every Tuesday night
Yeah I'd have a dirtbike in the shed
And not one throw pillow on the bed
I'd keep my cash in a coffee can
But if I was a single man
Alone and out there on the loose
Well I'd be looking for a woman like you."

She knows what a mess
I'd be if I didn't have her here
But to be sure
I whispered in her ear

"You know I get sick deep-sea fishin'
And you make the best fried chicken
I got a hopeless golf game
I love the sound of your name
I might miss that old green 'Nova
But I love watchin' you do yoga
I'd take a gold band on my hand
Over being a single man
Cause honestly
I don't know what I'd do
If I'd never met a woman like you."

[Verse 1]
Yeah, it's like a song playing all night long
Stuck in my head
Things I should've done
Things I could've, should've said
Forgive and forgetting
Life's too short to let hate hang around

[Verse 2]
Sometimes I wonder, is this the last summer
I go fishing with my daddy
In 20 years from now, if I'm still here
Will my beautiful wife still have me?
These are the voices, won't leave me alone
Questions I can't put down

[Chorus 1]
What keeps you up at night?
What makes your heartbeat wild?
What weighs on your mind, leaves you paralyzed?
What keeps you up at night?
Alright

[Verse 3]
See I believe in God, with all my heart
Sometimes I doubt and wonder
And I know that'd break my mamma's heart
And that weighs on me like thunder
Are these the best days of my life?
And when tomorrow comes
Will the skies open up, and blow my mind?

[Chorus 1]
What keeps you up at night?
What makes your heartbeat wild?
What weighs on your mind, leaves you paralyzed?
What keeps you up at night?

[Chorus 2]
What makes you take a stand?
Want to get up and dance?
What makes you laugh, you cry?
Raise your hands to the sky?
What keeps you up at night?

[Bridge]
For all the times I've run, the things I've done
Have I really been forgiven
Do I really know the real meaning
Of this beautiful life I'm living?
Well hell yeah I do, it's my kids
And what they learn from me
Will they take the good, or take the bad?

[Chorus 1]
What keeps you up at night?
What makes your heartbeat wild?
What weighs on your mind, leaves you paralyzed?
What keeps you up at night?

[Chorus 2]
What makes you take a stand?
Want to get up and dance?
What makes you laugh, you cry?
Raise your hands to the sky?
What keeps you up?
What keeps you up?
What keeps you up at night?

[Verse 1]
Friends try to set you up, try to find you someone new
They say you'll get along, you're just alike, she's perfect for you
But you can't help, you can't help who you love
She could be so beautiful, it don't even make no sense
Might dance with her all night, but you never call her again
'Cause you can't help, you can't help who you love

[Chorus]
Everybody's got somebody
Not just anybody
But the one
That you can't help who you love

[Verse 2]
Yeah, they might have broke your heart, might have really messed you up
You went ahead and cut them off, but you still ain't had enough
No you can't help, you can't help who you love
You could try out all those things, every song'll tell you what to do
Go out get drunk, and well it don't work 'cause it ain't up to you
No you can't help, you can't help who you love

[Chorus]
Everybody's got somebody
Not just anybody
But the one
That you can't help who you love

[Bridge]
Always be there for
When they're standing at your door
You're gonna let them back in again, and again, and again
'Cause you can't help who you love

[Chorus 2]
Oh, you can't help
No, you can't help
No, you can't help who you love

[Outro]
I've tried to get over us, I've done all I can do
That's why I'm giving up, that's why I'm calling you
Guess you can't help, you can't help who you love

[Verse 1: Lee Brice]
She got her daddy's tongue and temper
Sometimes her mouth could use a filter
God shook his head the day he built her
Oh, but I bet he smiled
She loves and lives her life, unruly
Tears up that dirt road up in a dually
Dangerous, absolutely
And in a little while
She'll be rounding that corner on three wheels
Ain't slowing down, yelling, "Come on, jump in"
Always up to something, crazy, got nothing on her

[Chorus: Lee Brice]
She ain't right
She ain't right
She ain't right
But she's just right for me

[Verse 2: Lee Brice]
She says she wants to meet my momma
I said, "I don't think you ought a
Be like mixing oil and water"
But by midnight, she had
Momma on the coffee table, dancing
Coming unwound
Good God, I swear, can't take her anywhere
What's the girl going to do next?

[Chorus: Lee Brice]
She ain't right
She ain't right
She ain't right
But she's just right for me

[Bridge: Lee Brice]
Every once in a while, she gives me that smile
And says, "I just don't see somebody like you
Loving somebody like me"

[Chorus: Lee Brice]
She ain't right
Oh, She ain't right
She ain't right
She ain't right
She ain't right
She's just right
She's just right
She's just right for me
She's just right
She's just right
She ain't right
She's just right for me

[Intro]
Hey, it's Big D and Bubba, and and we're live on location. We want you to come on out because this is not just a party; it's a parking lot party with Lee Brice!

[Verse 1]
Johnny's firing up his Coleman grill
We've got 24 tall boys on the chill
Yeah, 14 of 'em's mine
A little Marshall Tucker on the radio
(Can't you see?)
You know we're just catchin' a little groove before the show
Yeah, ain't playing nothing slow

[Chorus]
At the parking lot party
Tailgate buzz just sipping' on suds
Ain't never too early
To light one up, fill up your cup
'Cause there ain't no party like the pre-party
And after the party is the after-party
At the parking lot party

[Verse 2]
Well, the opening band is doin' sound-check
Man, they sound pretty good
Hell, I ain't even bought no tickets yet
Yeah, but that's alright we don't care
'Cause all the pretty girls are sitting' right here
Kicking back in the lawn chairs

[Chorus]
At the parking lot party
Tailgate buzz just sipping' on suds
Ain't never too early
To light one up, fill up your cup
'Cause there ain't no party like the pre-party
And after the party is the after-party
At the parking lot party

[Bridge]
Woh-oh-oh-oh!
Old Tom's pulling' his guitar out
Woh,-oh-oh-oh!
It's bout time to pass that shine around
Hey-hey-hey!
Show's about to start but we ain't about to leave
Hey hey hey!
It's one hell of a time and it's all for free!

[Chorus]
At the parking lot party
Tailgate buzz just sipping' on suds
Ain't never too early
To light one up, fill up your cup
'Cause there ain't no party like the pre-party
And after the party is the after-party
At the parking lot party

[Outro]
Oh yeah, cam on
Parking lot party
Oh, they're going to have to tow my ass out of here
Parking lot party
Oh, man, damn, girl
Parking lot party
Woo-ooh
Parking lot party
Don't think I've ever seen that before, lord
(Hey-hey-hey)

[Verse 1]
Songs in the kitchen
Playing on the radio
Coffee on the counter
Bacon frying on the stove
Billy Graham on TV
Mom and daddy kissing
Songs in the kitchen

[Verse 2]
Songs in the car
Fresh-pressed Sunday clothes
Momma putting on her make up
Daddy's bible on the dashboard
Me and Lewis in the back seat
Singing out our little hearts
Songs in the car

[Chorus]
All my dreams came true
My songs took me far away
Now I'm singing them every night
In these bright lights up on this stage
If you catch me close my eyes every now and then
To tell you the truth
I'm probably just missing
Songs in the kitchen
Songs in the car
Songs from the heart

[Instrumental]

[Verse 3]
Songs in the church
Choir a little out of tune
Preacher wiping his forehead
Us squirming in the pew
That old piano playing
Just as I am
Everytime we sing every verse
Yeah I wonder if I still can

[Chorus]
All my dreams came true
My songs took me far away
Now I'm singing them every night
In these bright lights up on this stage
If you catch me close my eyes every now and then
To tell you the truth
I'm probably just missing
Songs in the kitchen
Songs in the car
Songs in the church
Songs from the heart

Oh songs in the kitchen
Songs in the kitchen

[Verse 1]
When you can look at her picture
And not want to kiss her no more
When you don't feel like you've been hit by a train
At the sound of someone saying her name any more
When you can drive down the road
And not be afraid of what's playing on the radio…

[Chorus]
That's when you know it's over
That's when you know you've made it over to the other side
Ready for another ride
That's when you know it's over

[Verse 2]
When the time of the year
Don't stir up the tears any more
When it don't feel like the past is a gun
And there's nowhere to run any more
When it don't take every bone
To not dial her number just leave her alone

[Chorus]
That's when you know it's over
That's when you know you've made it over to the other side
Ready for another ride
That's when you know it's over

[Bridge]
When you wouldn't go back even if you could
When hearing she's happy finally feels good

[Chorus]
That's when you know it's over
That's when you know you've made it over to the other side
Ready for another ride
That's when you know it's over
That's when you know it's over

People say she's only in my head
I'm gonna take time but I'll forget
Say I need to get on with my life
What they don't realize is when
You're dialing six numbers just to hang up the phone
Drivin' across town just to see if she's home
Wakin' a friend in the dead of the night
Just to hear him say it'll be all right
When you're finding things to do to not fall asleep
'Cause you know she'll be there in your dreams
That's when she's more than a memory
Took a match to everything she ever wrote
Watched every word go up in smoke
Tore all her pictures off the wall
That ain't helpin' me at all
'Cause when you're talkin' out loud to nothing but air
You look like hell and you just don't care
You're drinking more than you ever drank
Sinking down lower than you ever sank
When you find yourself fallin' on your knees
Shakin' your fist and beggin' please
That's when she's more than a memory
Yeah, woho, hmm, she's more, she's more
People say she's only in my head
Going to take time but I'll forget
But when she's in every minute of everyday
Every thought I think, every breath I take
She's everywhere and she's everything
She's more than a memory

[Verse 1]
I just remember her tan legs standing on the side of the road
Honda with the hood up covered in smoke
Thumb in the air with somewhere to go in a hurry
She didn't say a thing, she just jumped inside
Stuck a gun to my chest and told me to drive
I was scared but she was beautiful, like a movie
She kept looking back like something was coming
Said we ain't slowing down, ain't stopping for nothing
My truck was shaking, my blood was pumping
But she was laughing
I about hit the brakes when we came around the corner
A mile of blue lights, guns aimed and pointed
Whatever she had is what they wanted
And it's all a little fuzzy after that

[Chorus]
All I remember is sirens
Blue lights flashing and driving
Dirt lane passing and flying
Tearing through the red lights
Blowing through the stop signs
All I remember is sirens
Ringing from the gun shots firing
One curve away from dying
Yeah, all I remember is...
Sirens

[Verse 2]
The man on the radio reported the chase
And all about the beauty
How she cleaned out the bank
She was armed and dangerous
And almost got away but they found her
She was cussing the choppers
They were swirling around
Reloading her revolver every couple-a-rounds
Shot off a couple shots
But they wouldn't back down

[Chorus 2]
All I remember is sirens
Blue lights flashing and driving
Dirt lane passing and flying
Tearing through the red lights
Blowing through the stop signs
All I remember is sirens
Ringing from the gun shots firing
One curve away from dying
Really, all I remember is...
Sirens
Yeahhh sirens

[Verse 3]
We were all out to road and I knew she could tell
Because she leaned across my lap and buckled my belt
And kissed me on the cheek and said
"Thanks for the help, and hold on boy."
Well she yanked the wheel and I held my breath
We flipped so many times we should have been dead
And that's all I got
And I just woke up here and I said

[Chorus 3]
All I remember is sirens
Blue lights flashing and driving
Dirt lane passing and flying
Tearing through the red lights
Blowing through the stop signs
All I remember is sirens
Blue lights flashing and smiling
One curve away from dying
All I remember is...
Sirens
Sirens...

[Outro]
And her blue eyes flashing
And those long legs standing on the side of the road
Her Honda with the hood up covered in smoke
Thumb in the air, somewhere to go in a hurry

[Verse 1]
He used to hold her hand, he used to hold her door
But she don't know what that feels like anymore
Just last night he was sleeping and she kissed his face
He said I gotta work in the morning and he rolled away

[Chorus]
He used to love her like crazy
You couldn't pull them apart
God, she felt so unbelievable in his arms
But now she's catching her self
Looking down at her ring every now and then
She don't want to him to leave
She just needs him to be that way again

[Verse 2]
So this morning she had coffee with a brand new friend
And she still had half a cup left when he asked her
"Can I see you again?"
Well that made her smile like she hadn't smiled in years
And in just a second that smile turned to tears

[Chorus]
He used to love me like crazy
You couldn't pull us apart
God, I felt so unbelievable in his arms
But now she's catching her self
Looking down at her ring every now and then
She don't want to leave
She just needs him to be that way again

[Bridge]
She left that little cafe, she headed straight to her car
She picked up her phone, he didn't say hi, he just said
Hey when you getting home?

[Chorus]
She said, you used to love me like crazy
You couldn't pull us apart
God, I felt so unbelievable in your arms
But now I'm catching myself
Looking down at my ring every now and then
I don't want to leave you
I just need you to be that way again

[Outro]
I don't want to leave you
I just need you to be
That way again

[Verse 1]
In a purple neon glow in some downtown bar
In a whiskey shot or a cigarette smoke ring heart
Even down six feet in a dead tired sleep
I guess I'm destined to toss and turn

[Chorus]
I see you even with my eyes closed, blindfolded
In a rain the world ain't seen since Noah
Every breath, every dream
You're here, you're there, you're in-between
Every sidewalk crack, every song I hear
Looking past Jesus on the dash, or in the rear view mirror
Every bit of you is burned like a tattoo on my soul
I see you even with my eyes closed

[Verse 2]
On a dust-filled lost road in some no-name town
A thousand miles from home, with me holding you now
Call it blessed, call it cursed, it heals and it hurts
I guess I'm destined to toss and turn

[Chorus]
I see you even with my eyes closed, blindfolded
And a rain the world ain't seen since Noah
Every breath, every dream
You're here, you're there, you're in-between
Every sidewalk crack, every song I hear
Looking past Jesus on the dash, in the rear view mirror
Every bit of you is burned like a tattoo on my soul
I see you even with my eyes closed
I see you even with my eyes closed

[Bridge]
Every sidewalk crack, every song I hear
Looking past Jesus on the dash, in the rear view mirror
Every bit of you is burned like a tattoo on my soul
I see you even with my eyes closed
Mmm, with my eyes closed, yeah
Whoa, yeah
Whoa, yeah

[Chorus]
I see you even with my eyes closed, blindfolded
And a rain the world ain't seen since Noah
Every breath, every dream
You're here, you're there, you're in-between
Every sidewalk crack, every song I hear
Looking past Jesus on the dash, in the rear view mirror
Every bit of you is burned like a tattoo on my soul
I see you even with my eyes closed, yeah
I see you even with my eyes closed, yeah
I see you even with my eyes closed
Yeah, and I close 'em all the time
I close 'em all the time

These last few days
What can I say
You've had me thinkin' in circles
In crazy not like me ways
My favorite thing
Lately has been waking up with you
Talkin ourselves to sleep again

Baby come a little closer
Let me lay some nibble kisses on your shoulder
You said that's your favorite place
Baby maybe we could borrow
Find a way to bag and
Steal a few tomorrows and stay
Here in these last few days

These last few days
Have blown me away
The thought of letting go
And falling
Is actually feeling okay
I must confess
I need some rest
But with every touch
I swear the better it seems to get

Baby come a little closer
Let me lay some nibble kisses on your shoulder
You said that your favorite place
Baby maybe we could borrow
Find a way to bag and
Steal a few tomorrows and stay
Here in these last few days

I ain't lookin for love
But whatever this is
I can't get enough

Baby come a little closer
Let me lay some nibble kisses on your shoulder
You said that your favorite place
Baby maybe we could borrow
Find a way to bag and
Steal a few tomorrows and stay
Here in the last few days

[Verse 1]
Well, I remember Friday nights
We were full of bull and natural light
Rock stars under the parking lot lights
Killing time in a little town
Window's tinted up, tailgate's down
Running our mouths, riding up and down
Just looking for a fight
We heard all our stories a thousand times
Somebody go on and tell them again
Ain't nobody going to mind

[Chorus]
Here's to the good old boy
The guitars that made the noise
And all the girls that we annoyed
And the ones we kissed goodnight
To the trucks that drove us home
Secrets we never told
And all the talks on old dirt roads
That somehow changed our lives
Here's to the nights we don't remember
And the friends we won't forget

[Verse 2]
Like I still smell the craw-fish stand
Diving head first in the morning drink
Standing in the lake watching water skis go by
Got a pretty girl sitting on my shoulders
And another pretty girl trying to push her over
My boys on the bank letting the horse shoes fly
Well, I can still see it now
All of us piling in our trucks and heading back into town

[Chorus]
Here's to the good old boy
The guitars that made the noise
And all the girls that we annoyed
And the ones we kissed goodnight
To the trucks that drove us home
Secrets we never told
And all the talks on old dirt roads
That somehow changed our lives
Here's to the nights we don't remember
And the friends we won't forget

[Outro]
Here's to last call when we didn't care
Holding our shots up in the air
A bunch of reckless boys
Man I swear, it's a wonder we survived
To the trucks that drove us home
The secrets we never told
And all the talks on old dirt roads
That somehow changed our lives
Here's to the nights we don't remember
Here's to the nights we don't remember
And the friends we won't forget

[Verse 1]
Yeah, you might say he ain't got much to his name
Sitting on the porch and waiting on the rain
His corn won't grow 'less the good Lord sheds his tears
He smiles and says, "There's always next year"
Yeah money, it don't come easy
But sonny, that ain't what's gonna please me
(It's the little things)

[Chorus]
Got a pretty girl on my left, old dog on my right
Cold beer in my hand on a Saturday night
You add it all up, it's bigger than you think
You don't need much, it's just the little things
It's the little things

[Verse 2]
He knows that old truck'll crank, yeah, it always turns over
Ain't got no need for a black Range Rover
The gun rack holds and the tape deck sings
What more could you need than just them little things

[Chorus]
Got a pretty girl on my left, old dog on my right
Cold beer in my hand on a Saturday night
You add it all up, it's bigger than you think
You don't need much, it's just the little things, yeah

[Bridge]
Just them little things
Oh, like a guitar player with a slide
Yeah

[Chorus]
Got a pretty girl on my left, old dog on my right
Cold beer in my hand on a Saturday night
You add it all up, it's bigger than you think
You don't need much, it's just the-
Hey
Got a pretty girl on my left, old dog on my right
Cold beer in my hand on a Saturday night
You add it all up, it's bigger than you think
You don't need much, it's just the little things

[Outro]
(Hm, what!?)
Yeah!
Yeah, I like it like that

[Verse 1]
The whole week on the beach, sunburns
Held aboard up on the floor of a cheap hotel
Give a rebel yell off the balcony (Heh)
Oh, we were proud to be from
The dirty south, y'all keep it down
But we turn it up and they kicked us out
We might have left but we didn't leave no doubt
What we were all about

[Chorus]
Everybody knew we brought the party
We were always getting something started
Weren't worried 'bout the consequences
Yeah, we liked to run through the fences
Each town learned to love and hate us
I'm pretty sure they're still talking 'bout us
I can't tell you everything but I'll tell you one
They won't forget about us

[Post-Chorus]
All our friends
All the trouble we got in
And we'd all do it all again

[Verse 2]
Hey, y'all remember that one time it was overtime
Laid the heat on the quarterback
He dropped the ball, we ran it back
Then after that
We hot-wired a team bus, got her fired up
Drove it round bout half the night
Saw the blue lights, they let us go
'Cause we brought the trophy home, yeah

[Chorus]
Everybody knew we brought the party
We were always getting something started
Weren't worried 'bout the consequences
But yeah, we liked to run through the fences
The town learned to love and hate us
I'm pretty sure they're still talking 'bout us
I can't tell you everything but I'll tell you one
They won't forget about us, no they won't

[Bridge]
They won't forget about us
All our friends
All the trouble we got in
We'd all do it all again

[Chorus]
Everybody knew we brought the party
We were always getting something started
Weren't worried 'bout the consequences
But yeah, we liked to run through the fences
The town learned to love and hate us
I'm pretty sure they're still talking 'bout us
I can't tell you everything but I'll tell you one
They won't forget about us, no
Hah, they won't forget about us

[Intro]
I don't smoke 'cause I never get high enough to get over you
(Alright baby, hey)

[Verse 1]
Mmm, a-have you ever been down, so low you can't see up
Something dragging you around, but you still ain't had enough
Oh, you know it's up there somewhere, but you still can't feel the sun
You're on the edge, a half a step away from coming undone

[Chorus]
I don't drink, 'cause I know my mind and every time I do
I just think about what you're doing and who you're doing it to
I don't take no pills to kill the pain 'cause they ain't never told me the truth
I don't smoke 'cause I never get high enough to get over you

[Bridge]
(Hey) I was the life of the party, yeah, you could count on me
But this a good time Charlie, ain't half the party I used to

[Chorus]
I don't drink, 'cause I know my mind and every time I do
I just think about what you're doing and who you're doing it to
I don't take no pills to kill the pain 'cause they ain't never told me the truth
I don't smoke 'cause I never get high enough to get over you
(Oh no)

I don't drink, 'cause I know my mind and every time I do
I just think about what you're doing and who you're doing it to
I don't take no pills to kill the pain 'cause they ain't never told me the truth
I don't smoke 'cause I never get high enough to get over you, yeah
I don't smoke 'cause I never get high enough to get over you

[Outro]
I could never get that high if I tried
I don't smoke 'cause I'll never
Get high enough to get over you, oh
Yeah, I don't smoke

[Verse 1]
Faded Levis, worn out chucks
Twenty in my pocket feels like a million bucks
Blue-eyed beauty, lean in to me
We got our own show in the back row
Missed the whole damn movie

[Chorus]
American nights, one headlight
Cutting down main street in the dark
Muscle Shoals, muscle cars
Earning our stripes underneath these stars

[Verse 2]
Blue Ribbon bottles, big block throttles
All night if you wanna, gonna make it last
A little taste of freedom, a little small town dreaming
No need to preach, no need to shout, we believe in

[Chorus]
American nights, one headlight
Cutting down main street in the dark
Muscle Shoals, muscle cars
Earning our stripes underneath these stars
American nights, yeah

[Bridge]
Pray the morning don't come
And these colors don't run
Stay up and stay all
American nights

[Chorus]
American nights, one headlight
Cutting down main street in the dark
Muscle Shoals, muscle cars
Earning our stripes underneath these stars
American nights, American nights
Yeah, American nights

[Outro]
Faded Levis, worn out chucks
Twenty in my pocket feels like a million bucks
Yeah, it does

[Verse 1: Lee Brice]
Well me and the boys are feeling alright
Raising some hell, sipping on whiskey and shine, yeah
Bob Dylan on the juke box, shooting some pool
Telling on stories and stretching the truth and lies
Yeah, I feel my cell phone start buzzing in my pocket

[Chorus: Lee Brice]
Boys, you keep on rocking but I gotta roll, roll
Point this Silverado down the road, road
Yeah, I know the beers here are cold
But I've got something warm waiting for me at home
Boys, I got to go see about a girl

[Verse 2: Lee Brice]
Ain't nothing you can say, so don't even try
The second she call that little girl made up my mind
Yeah, she did
Don't' buy me no shot, don't bring me no drink
Don't go wasting' your money on me, bye, bye

[Chorus: Lee Brice]
Boys, you know I gotta roll, roll
Point this Silverado down the road, road
Yeah, I know the beers here are cold
But I've got something warm waiting for me at home
Boys, I got to go see about a girl

[Bridge: Lee Brice]
If you ever find a girl like mine
Boys you'll know why

[Chorus: Lee Brice]
I gotta roll, roll
Point this Silverado down the road, road
Yeah, I know the beers here are cold
But I've got something warm waiting for me at home
Boys, I got to go see about a girl
I got to go see about my girl

[Outro: Lee Brice]
Ooh ooh oh yeah
Ooh ohh
Ooh ooh oh

I'll never settle down
That's what I always thought
Yeah, I was that kind of man
Just ask anyone
I don't dance, But here I am
Spinning you around and around in circles
It Ain't my style, but I don't care
I'd do anything with you anywhere
Yes, you got me in the palm of your hand
Cause, I don't dance
Love's never come my way
I've never been this far
Cause you took these two left feet
And waltzed away with my heart
No, I don't dance, but here I am
Spinning you around and around in circles
It ain't my style, but I don't care
I'd do anything with you anywhere
Yes, you got me in the palm of your hand, girl
Cause, I don't dance
Ohhh
I don't dance
Ooh

Spinning you around and around in circles
It ain't my style, but I don't care
I'd do anything with you anywhere
I don't dance, but here I am
Spinning you around and around in circles
It ain't my style, but I don't care
I'd do anything with you anywhere
Yeah, you got me in the palm of your hand, girl
Cause, I don't dance
Oh
No..
Oooh...
We got some Hank on deck
Snoop Dogg pumpin

Got my baby's butt jumpin
Somebody brought a jar
Got the whole party buzzin
The word on the street

(Everybody's coming tonight babe. Come on.)
Well it don't get

Well if your beer's gettin low
Go ahead and kill it
Got the Yeti in the back
Full of Bud Light chillin

Stick our toes in the mud
Let the sun go down
Til the moonlight fades away
We can hop in my truck
And take a little ride
Hold your head out the window
Let your hair blowdry
Whatever you want to do girl
(It don't matter. Either way)
Well it don't get

We're up when the rooster crows
Clock in when the whistle blows
Eight hours ticking slow
And then tomorrow we'll do it all over again
I'm a member of a blue collar crowd
They can never, nah they can't keep us down
If you gotta, gotta label me, label me proud
I belong to the drinking class
Monday through Friday, man we bust our backs
If you're one of us, raise your glass
I belong to the drinking class
We laugh, we cry, we love
Go hard when the going's tough
Push back, come push and shove
Knock us down, we'll get back up again and again

We get rowdy, we get wild and loud
If you gotta, gotta label me, label me proud
I belong to the drinking class
Monday through Friday, man we bust our backs
If you're one of us, raise your glass
I belong to the drinking class
We all know why we're here
A little fun, a little music, a little whiskey, a little beer
We're gonna shake off those long week blues

Girl, I'm glad you called, first heard you talk
Took me a second cause I couldn't hear your drawl
And that don't sound like you
No, that don't sound like you
I know it's been a while, I don't mean to pry
But when I asked you if you're happy I didn't hear a smile
And that don't sound like you
Nah, that ain't the girl I knew you always sounded like
Truck tires on a gravel road
Laughing at the world, blasting my radio
Tin balls flashing in the water
Doing whatever whenever you wanted
What did he do?
'Cause you don't sound like you anymore
Your pretty brown hair, you always loved it
Guess he didn't like it so you just cut it
And that don't sound like you
Nah, that ain't the girl I knew you always sounded like
Truck tires on a gravel road
Laughing at the world, blasting my radio
Tin balls flashing in the water
Doing whatever whenever you wanted
What did he do?
'Cause baby you don't sound like you anymore
Oh, anymore
That town, that job, that guy
You can leave them behind, girl, you know you're better than that
If you want to come back, you can come back
Baby, come back to
Truck tires on a gravel road
Laughing at the world, blasting my radio
Tin balls flashing in the water
Doing whatever whenever you wanted
What did he do?
'Cause you don't sound like you
Give me the girl I knew
'Cause you don't sound like you anymore
Mm, anymore
Girl, I'm glad you called, first heard you talk
Took me a second cause I couldn't hear your drawl
Girls in bikinis, bikinis
(Gimme, gimme)
Girls in bikinis
(Gimme, gimme)
Watching girls in bikinis is like watching a slinky walk down the stairs
Can't help but stare
They do the shimmy out of them cutoffs
Lay a towel down, and they look around
They ride up, they pull em out
Don't try to act like you don't know what I'm talking about
Camo, canary yellow, red white and blue
Highfive to the guy who thought about cutting that thing in two
String around her neck or without a strap
Laying on their bellies, untied off their backs
Watching girls in bikinis is like watching a slinky walk down the stairs
Can't help but stare
(Gimme, gimme)
Girls in bikinis
(Gimme, gimme)
Tie-dyed or polka-dot, coconut, muffin top, there in the sand, with a beer in her hand
They pop out, they put em back in
Covered up just enough not to be a sin
Camo, canary yellow, red white and blue
Highfive to the guy who thought about cutting that thing in two
String around her neck or without a strap
Laying on her belly, untied off her back
Watching girls in bikinis is like watching a slinky walk down the stairs
Can't help but stare
Jumping in the water (Haha)
Coming out the water (Hey boy)
Hey girl (What's up)
Um... (Uh oh it's getting cold in here)
Ow
Camo, canary yellow, red white and blue
Highfive to the guy who thought about cutting that thing in two
String around her neck or without a strap
Laying on her belly, untied off their back
Watching girls in bikinis is like watching a slinky walk down the stairs
Can't help but stare
(Gimme, gimme)
Watching girls in bikinis, yeah, girls in bikinis
(Gimme, gimme, girls in bikinis)
Watching girls in bikinis
Watching girls in bikinis
I just remember her tan legs standin' on the side of the road
Her Honda with the hood up covered in smoke
Thumb in the ear with somewhere to go in a hurry
She didn't say a thing, she just jumped inside
Stuck a gun to my chest and told me to drive
I was scared but she was beautiful, like a movie
She kept lookin' back like somethin' was comin'
Said we ain't slowin' down, ain't stoppin' for nothin'
My truck was shaking, my blood was pumpin'
But she was laughin'
I 'bout hit the brakes when we came around the corner
A mile of blue lights, guns aimed and pointed
Whatever she had is what they wanted
And it's all a little fuzzy after that
All I remember is sirens
Blue lights flashin' and drivin'
Dirt lane passin' and flyin'
Tearin' through the red lights
Blowin' through the stop signs
All I remember is sirens
Ringin' from the gun shots firin'
One curve away from dyin'
And all I remember is...
Sirens
The man on the radio reported the chase
And all about the beauty
How she cleaned out the bank
She was armed and dangerous
She almost got away but they found her
She was cussin' at choppers
They were swirlin' around
Reloadin' her revolver every couple-a-rounds
Shot off a couple shots
But they wouldn't back down
All I remember is sirens
Blue lights flashin' and drivin'
Dirt lane passin' and flyin'
Tearin' through the red lights
Blowin' through the stop signs
All I remember is sirens
Ringin' from the gun shots firin'
One curve away from dyin'
Baby all I remember is...
Sirens
We were all outta road and I knew she could tell
'cause she leaned across my lap and buckled my belt
And kissed me on the cheek and said
"Thanks for the help, and hold on boy."
Well she yanked the wheel and I held my breath
We flipped so many times we shoulda been dead
And that's all I got
And I just woke up here and, that's it
All I remember is sirens
Blue lights flashin' and drivin'
Dirt lane passin' and flyin'
Tearin' through the red lights
Blowin' through the stop signs
All I remember is sirens
Blue lights flashin' and smilin'
One curve away from dyin'
All I remember is...
Sirens
Sirens
And her blue eyes flashin'
And those long legs standin' on the side of the road
Her Honda with the hood up covered in smoke
Thumb in the ear
Somewhere to go in a hurry
It's three o'clock in the morning
I hear something buzzing
Over on that table beside the bed
Your name lighting up in red
Ain't no cars going down the street
Nobody would be calling' me
This time of night in their right mind
Somebody's been drinking
Somebody's been thinking about us
Somebody's all alone, picking up the phone
And they know they ought just hang up
Somebody's gonna be knocking
Somebodys gonna be lettin somebody in
Saying 'hey can I stay, one more time, it's ok'
So here we go again
Somebodys been drinking
We know, no good together
But you only seem to remember
The good stuff, when you got a good buzz
You'll stop me after that first kiss
And say 'we gotta quit doing this'
But we don't, and we do but we won't
Cause we know how good it is
Somebody's been drinking
Somebody's been thinking about us
Somebody's all alone, picking up the phone
And they know they oughta just hang up
Somebody's gonna be knocking
Somebody's gonna be letting somebody in
Saying 'hey can I stay, one more time, it's ok'
So here we go again
Somebody's been drinking
Somebody's been drinking
Well I don't know where you are
But I know where you're about to be
And I know you, and I know me
And somebody's been drinking
Somebody's been thinking about us
Somebody's all alone, picking up the phone
And they know they ought just hang up
Somebody's gonna be knocking
Somebody's gonna be letting somebody in
Saying 'hey can I stay, one more time, it's ok'
So here we go again
Somebody's been drinking
Somebody's been drinking
Waiting in the security line
I was mad as hell that I might miss my plane
I've been on the road for weeks
Cheap hotels and I ain't had no sleep in days
That's when, I heard the lady behind me crying
Mascara running from her eyes
She'd just got the news
This morning her husband died in a head on wreck
I turned around to her and said "ma'am is there anything I can do?"
She said "just thank God
For everything you've got"
I felt so stupid being mad
After seeing her so sad
I need to check my heart
I need to watch my mouth
Have a little more faith
A little less doubt, it ain't that hard to figure out
I got more than a man can need
A job, a house, a family, alive and well
Friends that call me all the time
Looking at my life seeing her crying all by herself
I had to thank God
For everything I got
I felt so stupid being mad
After seeing her so sad
I need to check my heart
I need to watch my mouth
Have a little more faith
A little less doubt, it ain't that hard to figure out
Waiting in the security line
I was mad as hell that I might miss my plane
Ten years ago I had to fly
Been living my dream trying to stay alive
I missed my buddies, I miss my home
Yea I do
I ain't seen my momma in way too long
Give me skinny cane pole and a hot bream bed
Catch me a little blue gill and a big flat head now
Some fresh boiled peanuts and shrimp and grits, mmm
Some jack in a barrel and a hog in the pit now
Need some hard red clay and a soft sand hill
Some black water healing some time to kill
I'm doing pretty good man but I ain't lying
I'm just trying to get back to my Carolina, yeah
Give me some beagles barking down in a hole
Running a cotton till soothing my soul
I need a live oak tree and a soy bean field
I wish I could take it like a pill
Need some hard red clay and a soft sand hill
Some black water healing some time to kill
I'm doing pretty good man but I ain't lying
I'm just trying to get back to my Carolina, yeah!
I need some dirty smoke and a jar of shine
Burn my tongue and ease my mind
I need some hard red clay and a soft sand hill
Some black water healing some time to kill
I'm doing pretty good man but I ain't lying
I'm just trying to get back to
I'm just trying to get back to my Carolina
Ten years ago I had to fly
I've been living my dream trying to stay alive
We hit that liquor store
By the county line
Whipped out a fake ID
I got from a friend of mine
We made our getaway
Due south to the gulf shore sand
You were looking like a woman child
I was feeling like a full grown man
We had a bottle of silver
And a bottle of sapphire
An Indian blanket
And a beachfront bonfire
We watched the moon
Ship wreck on the water
I don't remember, A night much hotter
You, were lying on the hood of my car
And I, was strumming on that old guitar
And we, were looking for the northern stars
And midnight played like a drive in scene
You were doing Liz Taylor
I was doing James Dean
And I loved you as much as I could at 18
With sand in your hair and sand in my jeans
It was so right, all night
And the sunset looked like an airbrushed t-shirt
Sewed on the street in Panama City
I grabbed the camera and snapped off the picture
You said 'love, ain't it a pitty
Someday this moment will fade away
Replaced by a photograph'
Like the way we remember the words to a joke
And forgot how hard it made us laugh
We had a bottle of silver
And a bottle of sapphire
An Indian blanket
And a beachfront bonfire
We watched the moon
Ship wreck on the water
God I miss that summer
But not as much as I miss you
I miss you

[Outro]
Yeah you looking at a good man now ain't you girl

Everybody got a song to sing, they got a story to tell
Maybe the love on a lifetime, or a living hell
I guess what I'm trying to say is we gotta figure it out
What we're gonna sing about, what we're gonna sing about
Oh yeah, alright

Somebody gonna sing the blues about being done wrong
The pain and the sorrow is too much to overcome
Then I hear [?] sing about the one thing he knows
Sing about love

Everybody got a song to sing, they got a story to tell
About the love of your life, or a living hell
I guess what I'm trying to say, we gotta figure it out
We got a choice to make, boy, what you gonna sing about

I saw a little bird with a broken wing
She ain't ever gonna fly but she sure gonna sing
About the blue sky, not about missing out
I wanna be that bird

Raise your voice, close your eyes
And find the melody
Brothers and sisters, let it ring out

What we're gonna sing about
What we're gonna sing about
Yeah, I guess what I'm trying to say
Is what we're gonna sing about, we're gonna sing about
Yeah, yeah
What we're gonna sing about

[Verse 1]
I know you're thinking
That you got me all figured out
A music man like me ain't ever going to settle down
And you're just waiting around for the day
That you're convinced ain't ever gonna come
And just the thought of wedding bells
Would make me want to run away
Well all I can say

[Chorus]
Is don't believe everything you think
Baby, I might just have a ring in my pocket right now
So settle on down girl
Reel that wild imagination in
Baby, come on back to me again
Yeah, oh the mind's a funny thing
Don't believe everything you think

[Verse 2]
Every-time another pretty girl comes walking by
I see your wheels turning
The way you watch my eyes, girl I don't know why
You let it cross your mind that I ain't crazy over you
And I don't want all the very same things you do
Babe, all I'm going to say

[Chorus]
Is don't believe everything you think
Baby, I might just have a ring in my pocket right now
So settle on down girl
Reel that wild imagination in
Baby, come on back to me again
Yeah, the mind's a funny thing
Don't believe everything you think

[Bridge]
Girl, you need to get on out of your head
And into your heart instead
Like I said
[Chorus]
Don't believe everything you think
Baby, I might just have a ring in my pocket right now
So settle on down girl
Reel that wild imagination back in
Baby, come on back to me again
Yeah, the mind's a funny thing
Don't believe everything you think

[Outro]
Mmmm, yeah the mind's a funny thing, don't believe everything you think

[Verse 1]
It's three o'clock in the morning
I hear something buzzing
Over on that table beside the bed
Your name lighting up in red
Ain't no cars going down the street
Nobody would be calling' me
This time of night in their right mind

[Chorus]
Somebody's been drinking
Somebody's been thinking about us
Somebody's all alone, picking up the phone
And they know they ought just hang up
Somebody's going to be knocking
Somebody's going to be letting somebody in
Saying hey can I stay, one more time, it's OK
So here we go again
Somebody's been drinking

[Verse 2]
We know, no good together
But you only seem to remember
The good stuff, when you got a good buzz
You'll stop me after that first kiss
And say 'we got to quit doing this
But we don't, and we do but we won't
Because we know how good it is

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
Well I don't know where you are
But I know where you're about to be
And I know you, and I know me

[Chorus]

[Verse 1]
Yeah, Colton, he turned eight years old, three very short long weeks ago
And just how long he'll be around, the doctors, they don't even know
A Nerf ball, football, in the yard, daddy throws it easy 'cause walkin's hard
Sometimes for living there ain't no cure, and tomorrow damn sure ain't for sure

[Hook]
So what do you say
Let's have a good day, yeah

[Verse 2]
So way down south from Mexico ran a barefoot boy, skin and bones
A mission group from the States came through to hand out clothes and build a school
Someone gave that kid some bread, he didn't keep it for himself instead
He broke that piece, too small for one, and gave both to his brothers some

So what do you say, yeah
Let's have a good day
I'm gonna hold my kids a little stronger
I'm gonna kiss my wife a little longer

[Verse 3]
Well, Kenny, he's a fearless man, he lost his eyesight in a hand
Standing up for his Uncle Sam, fighting in that desert sand
His wife and kids still struggle when he has those nightmares now and then
He swears even if they never end he would do it all again

[Hook]
So what do you say
Let's have a good day

[Bridge]
Yeah, Colton, he was only eight, said he saw angels, couldn't wait
To fly him home to a better place, with a smile on his face he said

[Outro]
What do you say
Fly me away
Let's have a good day
Let's have a good day, oh
Oh, let's have a good day
Let's have a good day

[Verse 1]
Wish I could say, I could say I've been looking for you my whole life
But I never believed, I never dreamed, I never knew anything could feel this right
I got a past I couldn't get past, but it don't haunt me any more
Because all my demons they ran like hell when my angel walked through my door

[Chorus]
You were always the only one
You were always the only one
Yeah

[Verse 2]
If I had a chance, a chance to take it all back, God knows I would
Hide your heart away, hide you from the pain every second if I could
Well baby no matter what happens now, you can know I'm always yours
I ain't ever going nowhere, because I ain't never loved, no loved nobody more

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
If you never believe anything else I ever say
Every second, every moment, every day every day
If you never believe anything else I ever say
Every second, every moment, in every way

[Chorus]

[Verse 1]
It can make a a man feel like a kid
Or feel just like a clown
It can make him run for cover
Or stay and stand his ground
It can make a man pick up the bottle
Or help him lay it down
It can stop his whole world from turning
Or turn his whole world around

[Chorus]
That's the power of a woman
It's the touch of her hand
One smile one tear one whisper in your ear
That's the power of a woman

[Verse 2]
It can make a man beg for Jesus
Or make him wish he'd never asked
It can make him dream about the future
Or make a nightmare of his past

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
She can say so much without saying a word
That's just the power of a woman
It's the touch of her hand
One smile one tear one whisper in your ear
That's the power of a woman

[Chorus]

[Outro]
The power of a woman
She can make you feel like a king or feel just like a clown

[Verse 1]
Some's born to take life safe and easy
I was born to live life on a dare
I never worried about the fall
You all, just how high I got in the air
Flipping dirt bikes and rolling daddy's truck
The highs kept me smiling through the tears

[Chorus]
I'll take years off my life
Before I take life off my years

[Verse 2]
There are those who take it slow and steady
I happen to keep it between the lines
Line up their ducks before they're ready
I'll have no regrets when it comes my time
Life's never dealt me any aces
But I'm all in double-down no fear

[Chorus]
I'll take years off my life
Before I take life off my years

[Verse 3]
Town water towers and county quarries
No trespassing meant come on in
Skydiving drunk, now there's your story
And giving that farmer's bull a spin
Ain't a fan of going slow around corners
Stomp on the gas and grab another gear

[Chorus]
I'll take years off my life
Before I take life off my years

[Verse 4]
I love the view up on this high wire
Oh, without a net down below
While most are running from the wildfires
I can't wait to get too close
What's the use of life if you don't live it?
You sip your water, I'll drink my beer

[Chorus]
I'll take years off my life
Before I take life off my years
I'll take a couple years off my life
Before I take life off my years

[Intro]
Damn girl looking so pretty
Hows about a little drive to the city
I want to show you off

[Verse 1]
I know you like it
That I'm shy and kinda quiet
But tonight I
I kinda don't want to be
The way you walked in
Painted red lips
The way that red dress
Is hugging up on your hips
I want the whole world to see

[Chorus]
Damn girl looking so pretty
Hows about a little drive to the city
I want to show you off
Tonight
Hey babe spend the night with me
Make the down-town boys jealous when you kiss me
I want to show you off
Tonight

[Verse 2]
I know a guy who
Owns a bar up
On a rooftop
Close to the stars yeah
He'll treat us like a king and queen
You know the band there
Plays some country
John Montgomery "Love the way you love me"
Aw but they could play anything
Long as you're dancing with me

[Chorus]
Damn girl looking so pretty
Hows about a little drive to the city
I want to show you off
Tonight
Hey babe spend the night with me
Make the down-town boys jealous when you kiss me
I want to show you off
Tonight
Damn girl looking so pretty
Hows about a little drive to the city
I want to show you off
Tonight
Hey babe spend the night with me
Make the down-town boys jealous when you kiss me
I want to show you off
Tonight
Damn girl looking so pretty
Hows about a little drive to the city
I want to show you off
Tonight
Hey babe spend the night with me
Make the down-town boys jealous when you kiss me
I want to show you off
Tonight

[Verse 1]
We got some Hank on deck
Snoop Dog pumping
The bass behind the seats
Got my baby's butt jumping
Somebody brought a jar
Got the whole party buzzing
The word on the street
Is everybody's coming
(Everybody's coming tonight babe. Come on.)

[Chorus]
Well it don't get
No better than this
We got the sunshine on our face
Moonshine on our lips
Well around here
This is as good as it gets
We got the summertime with my friends
Everybody take a sip
Well it don't get
Yeah it don't get better than this

[Verse 2]
Well if your beer's getting low
Go ahead and kill it
Got the Yeti in the back
Full of Bud Light chilling
(Aw that beer is getting cold)
Well if it gets too hot
Take your girl to the river
Grab a rope swing knot
Back-flip
Make her shiver
(Make her shiver now)

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
We can stay right here
Let the wind blow around
Stick our toes in the mud
Let the sun go down
Until the moonlight fades away
We can hop in my truck
And take a little ride
Hold your head out the window
Let your hair blow dry
Whatever you want to do girl
(It don't matter. Either way)

[Chorus][x2]

[Outro]
Yeah it don't get better than this
Aww it don't get better than this
(Yeah it don't get no better.)

[Verse 1]
When it rains, it pours
But you didn't even notice
It ain't rainin' anymore
It's hard to breathe when all you know is
The struggle of stayin' above the risin' water line

[Chorus]
Well, the sky has finally opened
The rain and wind stopped blowin'
But you're stuck out in the same ol' storm again
You hold tight to your umbrella
Well, darlin', I'm just tryin' to tell ya
That there's always been a rainbow
Hangin' over your head

[Verse 2]
If you could see what I see
You'd be blinded by the colors
Yellow, red, and orange, and green
And at least a million others
So tie up the boat, take off your coat
And take a look around

[Chorus]
'Cause the sky has finally opened
The rain and wind stopped blowin'
But you're stuck out in the same ol' storm again
You hold tight to your umbrella
Well, darlin', I'm just tryin' to tell ya
That there's always been a rainbow
Hangin' over your head

[Bridge]
Oh, tie up the boat, take off your coat
And take a look around
Everything is alright now

[Chorus]
'Cause the sky has finally opened
The rain and wind stopped blowin'
But you're stuck out in the same ol' storm again
Let go of your umbrella
'Cause, darlin', I'm just tryin' to tell ya
That there's always been a rainbow
Hangin' over your head
Yeah, there's always been a rainbow
Hangin' over your head

[Outro]
Mmm
It'll all be alright

[Verse 1]
I was just coastin', never really goin' anywhere
Caught up in a web, I was gettin' kinda used to stayin' there
And out of the blue, I fell for you

[Chorus 1]
Now, you're lifting me up 'stead of holding me down
Stealing my heart 'stead of stealing my crown
Untangled all the strings 'round my wings that were tied
I didn't know him and I didn't know me
Cloud Nine was always out of reach
Now, I remember what it feels like to fly
You give me butterflies

[Verse 2]
Kiss full of color makes me wonder where you've always been
I was hiding in doubt 'til you brought me out of my chrysalis
And I came out new
All because of you

[Chorus 1]
And now, you're lifting me up 'stead of holding me down
Stealing my heart 'stead of stealing my crown
Untangled all the strings 'round my wings that were tied
I didn't know him and I didn't know me
Cloud Nine was always out of reach
Now, I remember what it feels like to fly
You give me butterflies, yeah
You give me butterflies
Ooh, mmm, mmm

[Chorus 2]
Now, you're lifting me up 'stead of holding me down
You're taking my hand 'stead of taking my crown
Untangled all the strings 'round my wings that were tied
I didn't know him and I didn't know me
Cloud Nine was always out of reach
Now, I remember what it feels like to fly
You give me butterflies
You give me butterflies

[Verse 1]
Born in a hurry, always late
Haven't been early since '88
Texas is hot, I can be cold
Grandma cried when I pierced my nose
Good in a glass, good on green
Good when you're putting your hands all over me

[Chorus]
I'm alright with a slow burn
Taking my time, let the world turn
I'm gonna do it my way, it'll be alright
If we burn it down and it takes all night
It's a slow burn, yeah

[Verse 2]
In Tennessee, the sun's goin' down
But in Beijing, they're heading out to work
You know the bar down the street don't close for an hour
We should take a walk and look at all the flowers

[Chorus]
'Cause I'm alright with a slow burn
Taking my time, let the world turn
I'm gonna do it my way, it'll be alright
If we burn it down and it takes all night
It's a slow burn

[Bridge]
Whatever feels good

[Outro]
Old soul, waiting my turn
I know a few things, but I still got a lot to learn
So I'm alright with a slow burn, slow burn, slow burn
I'm alright with a slow burn

[Verse 1]
You look out the window while I look at you
Saying I don't know would be like saying that the sky ain't blue
And boots weren't made for sitting by the door
Since you don't wanna stay anymore

[Chorus]
You can have your space, cowboy
I ain't gonna fence you in
Go on, ride away in your Silverado
Guess I'll see you 'round again
I know my place, and it ain't with you
Well sunsets fade, and love does, too
Yeah, we had our day in the sun
When a horse wants to run, there ain't no sense in closing the gate
You can have your space, cowboy

[Verse 2]
After the gold rush, there ain't no reason to stay
Shoulda learned from the movies that good guys don't run away
But roads weren't made to not go down
And there ain't room for both of us in this town

[Chorus]
So you can have your space, cowboy
I ain't gonna fence you in
Go on, ride away in your Silverado
I'll see you around again
'Cause I know my place, and it ain't with you
Sunsets fade, and love does, too
We had our day in the sun
When a horse wants to run, ain't no sense in closing the gate
So you can have your space

[Chorus]
You can have your space, cowboy
I ain't gonna fence you in
Go on, ride away in your Silverado
I'll see you around again
'Cause I know my place, and it ain't with you
Sunsets fade, and love does, too
Though we had our day in the sun
When a horse wants to run, ain't no sense in closing the gate
You can have your space
Yeah, you can have your space
You can have your space, cowboy

[Verse 1]
All that I know
Is you caught me at the right time
Keep me in your glow
'Cause I'm having such a good time
With you

[Chorus]
Baby, don't you know?
That you're my golden hour
The color of my sky
You've set my world on fire
And I know, I know everything's gonna be alright

[Verse 2]
I used to get sad
And lonely when the sun went down
But it's different now
'Cause I love the light that I've found
In you

[Chorus]
Baby, don't you know?
That you're my golden hour
The color of my sky
You've set my world on fire
And I know, I know everything's gonna be alright

[Bridge]
You make the world look beautiful, ooh
I thought I'd seen it all before
But looking through your eyes
It looks like paradise

[Chorus]
You've set my world on fire, yeah
And I know, I know everything's gonna be alright
You're my golden hour
The color of my sky
You've set my world on fire
And I know, I know everything's gonna be alright
Yeah, I know, I know everything's gonna be alright
Golden hour

[Verse 1]
If you ain't got two kids by 21
You're probably gonna die alone
At least that's what tradition told you
And it don't matter if you don't believe
Come Sunday morning you best be
There in the front row, like you're s'posed to
Same hurt in every heart
Same trailer, different park

[Pre-Chorus]
Mama's hooked on Mary Kay
Brother's hooked on Mary Jane
And Daddy's hooked on Mary two doors down

[Chorus]
Mary Mary quite contrary
We get bored so we get married
And just like dust we settle in this town
On this broken merry go 'round
And 'round and 'round we go
Where it stops nobody knows
And it ain't slowin' down
This merry go 'round

[Verse 2]
We think the first time's good enough
So we hold on to high school love
Say we won't end up like our parents
Tiny little boxes in a row
Ain't what you want it's what you know
Just happy in the shoes you're wearin'
Same checks we're always cashin'
To buy a little more distraction

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause Mama's hooked on Mary Kay
Brother's hooked on Mary Jane
And Daddy's hooked on Mary two doors down

[Chorus]
Mary Mary quite contrary
We get bored so we get married
And just like dust we settle in this town
On this broken merry go 'round
And 'round and 'round we go
Where it stops nobody knows
And it ain't slowin' down
This merry go 'round
Mary Mary quite contrary
We're so bored until we're buried
And just like dust we settle in this town
On this broken merry go 'round
And 'round and 'round we go
Where it stops nobody knows
And it ain't slowin' down
This merry go 'round

[Outro]
Jack and Jill went up the hill
Jack burned out on booze and pills
And Mary had a little lamb
Mary just don't give a damn no more

[Verse 1]
Oh, I bet you think you're John Wayne
Showing up and shooting down everybody
You're classic in the wrong way
And we all know the end of the story

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause everyone knows someone who kills the buzz
Every time they open up their mouth
Yeah, everyone knows someone who knows someone
Who thinks they're cooler than everybody else

[Chorus]
And I think we've seen enough, seen enough
To know that you ain't ever gonna come down
So, why don't you giddy up, giddy up
And ride straight out of this town
You and your high horse
You and your high horse

[Verse 2]
I bet you think you're first place
Yeah, someone should give you a ribbon
And put you in the hall of fame
For all the games that you think that you're winning

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause everyone knows someone who kills the buzz
Every time they open up their mouth
Yeah, everyone knows someone who knows someone
Who thinks they're cooler than everybody else

[Chorus]
And I think we've seen enough, seen enough
To know that you ain't ever gonna come down
So, why don't you giddy up, giddy up
And ride straight out of this town
You and your high horse
You and your high horse

[Bridge]
Darling, you take the high horse and I'll take the high road
If you’re too good for us, you’ll be good riding solo

[Chorus]
Yeah, I think we've seen enough, seen enough
To know that you ain't ever gonna come down
So, why don't you giddy up, giddy up
And ride straight out of this town
You and your high horse
You and your high horse
High horse
You ain’t ever gonna come down
You ain’t ever gonna come down

[Verse 1]
It's not you, it's the glow of the party
The way that you've got me lit up inside
It's the song that they're playin', the words that you're sayin'
It's never felt so right

[Pre-Chorus]
And I'm the kind of person who starts getting kinda nervous
When I'm having the time of my life

[Chorus]
Is there a word for the way that I'm feeling tonight?
Happy and sad at the same time
You got me smiling with tears in my eyes
I never felt so high
No, I've never been this far off of the ground
And they say everything that goes up must come down
But I don't wanna come down

[Verse 2]
So is there a way to stop all this thinkin', just keep on drinkin'?
'Cause I don't wanna wake up
When they're turnin' the lights on and it turns out the joke's on me
'Cause it feels so right

[Pre-Chorus]
And I'm the kind of person who starts getting kinda nervous
When I'm having the time of my life

[Chorus]
Is there a word for the way that I'm feeling tonight?
Happy and sad at the same time
You got me smilin' with tears in my eyes
I never felt so high
No, I've never been this far off of the ground
And they say everything that goes up must come down
But I don't wanna come down

[Bridge]
I don't mind at all, no, I'm used to fallin'
I'm comfortable when the sky is gray
But when everything is perfect, I start hidin'
'Cause I know that rain is comin' my way, my way

[Chorus]
'Cause I'm happy and sad at the same time
You got me smilin' with tears in my eyes
I never felt so high
No, never been this far off of the ground
And they say everything that goes up, goes up must come down
And I don't wanna come down
No, I don't wanna come down

[Intro]
Oh, what a world, I don't wanna leave
There's all kinds of magic; it's hard to believe
Oh, what a world, I don't wanna leave
There's all kinds of magic; it's hard to believe

[Verse 1]
Northern lights in our skies
Plants that grow and open your mind
Things that swim with a neon glow
How we all got here, nobody knows

[Pre-Chorus]
These are real things
These are real things

[Chorus]
Oh, what a world, don't wanna leave
All kinds of magic all around us; it's hard to believe
Thank God it's not too good to be true
Oh, what a world, and then there is you

[Verse 2]
Did I know you once in another life?
Are we here just once or a billion times?
Well, I wish I knew, but it doesn't matter
'Cause you're here right now, and I know what I feel

[Pre-Chorus]
And these are real things
Yeah, these are real things

[Chorus]
Oh, what a world, don't wanna leave
All kinds of magic all around us; it's hard to believe
Thank God it's not too good to be true
Oh, what a world, and then there is you
Oh, and then there is you

[Pre-Chorus]
These are real things
These are real things

[Chorus 2]
Oh, what a world, all kinds of magic
Tell me it's not too good to be true
Oh, what a world, and then there is you

[Outro]
Oh, what a world, I don't wanna leave
There's all kinds of magic; it's hard to believe
(And then there is you)
Oh, what a world, I don't wanna leave
There's all kinds of magic; it's hard to believe
(And then there is you)
Oh, what a world, I don't wanna leave
There's all kinds of magic; it's hard to believe
(And then there is you)
Oh, what a world, I don't wanna leave
There's all kinds of magic; it's hard to believe

[Verse 1]
If you save yourself for marriage, you're a bore
If you don't save yourself for marriage, you're a horrible person
If you won't have a drink, then you're a prude
But they'll call you a drunk as soon as you down the first one

[Verse 2]
If you can't lose the weight, then you're just fat
But if you lose too much, then you're on crack
You're damned if you do and you're damned if you don't
So, you might as well just do whatever you want

[Chorus]
So, make lots of noise, kiss lots of boys
Or kiss lots of girls if that's somethin' you're into
When the straight and narrow gets a little too straight
Roll up a joint, or don't
Just follow your arrow wherever it points
Yeah, follow your arrow wherever it points

[Verse 3]
If you don't go to church, you'll go to Hell
If you're the first one on the front row, you're a self-righteous son of a...
Can't win for losin', you'll just disappoint 'em
Just 'cause you can't beat 'em don't mean you should join 'em

[Chorus]
So, make lots of noise, kiss lots of boys
Or kiss lots of girls if that's somethin' you're into
When the straight and narrow gets a little too straight
Roll up a joint, or don't
Just follow your arrow wherever it points
Yeah, follow your arrow wherever it points

[Bridge]
Say what you think, love who you love
'Cause you just get so many trips around the sun
Yeah, you only...
Only live once

[Chorus]
So, make lots of noise, kiss lots of boys
Or kiss lots of girls if that's what you're into
When the straight and narrow gets a little too straight
Roll up a joint, I would
And follow your arrow wherever it points
Yeah, follow your arrow wherever it points

[Verse]
Bursting with empathy, I'm feeling everything
The weight of the world on my shoulders
Hope my tears don't freak you out
They're just kinda coming out
It's the music in me and all of the colors

[Chorus]
Wish we didn't live, wish we didn't live so far from each other
I'm just sitting here thinking 'bout the time that's slipping
And missing my mother, mother
And she's probably sitting there
Thinking 'bout the time that's slipping
And missing her mother, mother

[Verse 1]
All I ever wanted was something classic
The kind of love song that goes on 'til the end of time
All I ever wanted was a little magic
With a good laugh, jet-black sparkle in his eyes

[Chorus]
You're my velvet Elvis, I ain't never gonna take you down
Making everybody jealous when they step into my house
Soft to the touch, feels like love, knew it as soon as I felt it
You're my velvet Elvis, baby

[Verse 2]
I don't really care 'bout the Mona Lisa
I need a Graceland kind of man who's always on my mind
I wanna show you off every evening
Go out with you in powder blue and tease my hair up high

[Chorus]
You're my velvet Elvis, I ain't never gonna take you down
Making everybody jealous when they step into my house
Soft to the touch, feels like love, knew it as soon as I felt it
You're my velvet Elvis, baby
You're my velvet Elvis, baby

[Bridge]
I knew it as soon as I felt it
Mm-mm, I knew it as soon as I felt it
Yeah

[Chorus]
You're my velvet Elvis, I ain't never gonna take you down
Making everybody jealous when they step into my house
Soft to the touch, feels like love, knew it as soon as I felt it
You're my velvet Elvis, baby
You're my velvet Elvis, baby, yeah

[Verse 1]
You can't find it sitting on a shelf in a store
If you try to hide it, it's gonna shine even more

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Even if you lose it, it will find you
There's no way to stop it, but they'll try to

[Chorus]
Running like a river tryna find the ocean
Flowers in the concrete
Climbing over fences, blooming in the shadows
Places that you can't see
Coming through the melody when the night bird sings
Love is a wild thing

[Verse 2]
Oh, I can feel it, magic in your fingertips
And I can hear it in the words coming off your lips

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Even if you lose me, I will find you
There's no way to stop it, so don't try to

[Chorus]
Running like a river tryna find the ocean
Flowers in the concrete
Climbing over fences, blooming in the shadows
Places that you can't see
Coming through the melody when the night bird sings
Love is a wild thing

[Bridge]
I used to be scared of the wilderness, of the dark
But not anymore, anymore, no

[Chorus]
Running like a river tryna find the ocean
Flowers in the concrete
Climbing over fences, blooming in the shadows
Places that you can't see
Coming through the melody when the night bird sings
Love is a wild thing
Love is a wild thing
Love is a wild thing, yeah

[Intro]
It's a lo-, it's a lo-, it's a lonely weekend
It's a lo-, it's a lo-, it's a lonely feelin' without you

[Verse 1]
Monday, I was gone, and Tuesday, you were working late
Wednesday went to hell, then Thursday kinda had the wait, yeah
Friday, you were leavin', goin' out of town again
I should see what's goin' on, only got a couple friends

[Chorus]
It's a lo-, it's a lo-, it's a lonely weekend (So lonely)
It's a lo-, it's a lo-, it's a lonely feelin' without you
Guess everybody else is out tonight (Out tonight)
Guess I'm hangin' by myself, but I don't mind (I don't mind)
It's a lo-, it's a lo-, it's a lonely weekend, yeah

[Verse 2]
I got a million things to do, but I haven't done a single one, no
And if my sister lived in town, I know that we'd be doin' something fun, mmm
I keep lookin' at my phone, puttin' it back down
There's a little part of me that's got the fear of missin' out, and

[Chorus]
It's a lo-, it's a lo-, it's a lonely weekend (So lonely)
It's a lo-, it's a lo-, it's a lonely feelin' without you
I guess everybody else is out tonight (Out tonight)
Guess I'm hangin' by myself, but I don't mind (I don't mind)
It's a lo-, it's a lo-, it's a lonely weekend, yeah

[Bridge]
Even if you got somebody on your mind
It's alright to be alone sometimes
Sometimes

[Chorus]
It's a lo-, it's a lo-, it's a lonely weekend (So lonely)
It's a lo-, it's a lo-, it's a lonely feelin' without you
I guess everybody else is out tonight (Out tonight)
Guess I'm hangin' by myself, but I don't mind (I don't mind)
It's a lo-, it's a lo-, it's a lonely weekend
It's a lo-, it's a lo-, it's a lonely weekend

[Verse 1]
I like where this is going
And you like it too
We rarely never ever don't see eye to eye
We're going to

[Pre-Chorus 1]
I can show you strong, I can fight for you
I can try to move mountains if you want me to

[Chorus]
But, baby, I ain't Wonder Woman
I don't know how to lasso the love out of you
Don't you know I'm only human?
And if I let you down, I don't mean to
All I need's a place to land
I don't need a Superman to win my lovin'
'Cause, baby, I ain't Wonder Woman

[Verse 2]
Bet all that gold gets heavy
Weighin' on her
I wonder if it's scary
Always tryin' not to get hurt

[Pre-Chorus 2]
I know how it feels, it ain't easy
There's a reason why you only see it in the movies

[Chorus]
'Cause, baby, I ain't Wonder Woman
I don't know how to lasso the truth out of you
Don't you know I'm only human?
And if I let you down, I don't mean to
All I need's a place to land
I don't need a Superman to win my lovin'

[Bridge]
You don't know how to fly, no
That's okay, neither do I

[Chorus]
I know I ain't Wonder Woman
I don't know how to lasso the love out of you
Don't you know I'm only human?
And if I let you down, I don't mean to
All I need's a place to land
I don't need a Superman to win my lovin'
'Cause, baby, I ain't Wonder Woman
Yeah, I know I ain't Wonder Woman

[Verse 1]
Get a little drunk, get a little loud
Stupid me and my rebel mouth
Ain't all wrong but I ain't alright
Don't see the world in black and white
My grandma cried when I pierced my nose
I never liked doing what I was told
Don't judge me and I won't judge you
'Cause I ain't walkin' in your shoes

[Chorus]
'Cause I ain't one to knock religion
Though it's always knockin' me
Always runnin' with the wrong crowd
Right where I want to be
And I ain't good at being careful
I just say what's on my mind
Like my idea of heaven
Is to burn one with John Prine

[Verse 2]
And maybe he would sit awhile
And render me an illegal smile
And I bet that he would understand
Just how I feel and who I am

[Chorus]
'Cause I ain't one to knock religion
Though it's always knockin' me
Always runnin' with the wrong crowd
Right where I want to be
And I ain't good at being careful
I just say what's on my mind
Like my idea of heaven
Is to burn one with John Prine

[Bridge]
And I play my life like truth or dare
I'm not all here but I'm all there, yeah
And all the colors people paint me
Don't they know they'll never change me, yeah

[Chorus]
'Cause I ain't one to knock religion
Though it's always knockin' me
Always runnin' with the wrong crowd
Right where I want to be
And I ain't good at being careful
I just say what's on my mind
Like my idea of heaven
Is to burn one with John Prine
Yeah, my idea of heaven
Is to burn one with John Prine

[Verse 1]
They're there for your first year, they give you your first beer
When you get your heart broke, they're there for your worst year
Don't get you at all, but your apple don't fall too far from 'em
They own too much wicker and drink too much liquor
You'd wash your hands of them, but blood's always thicker
You might look just like 'em; that don't mean you're like 'em
But you love 'em

[Chorus 1]
Family is family, in church or in prison
You get what you get, and you don't get to pick 'em
They might smoke like chimneys, but give you their kidneys
Yeah, friends come in handy, but family is family

[Verse 2]
They're there when you're married, divorced and remarried
You fall out of touch, but then someone gets buried
And you're right back together like no time has ever gone by
Can't live with or without 'em; you might talk about 'em
But if someone else does, well, then you'll knock 'em out 'cause
When it's all said and done, they're the only ones that you got

[Chorus 1]
Family is family, in church or in prison
You get what you get, and you don't get to pick 'em
They might smoke like chimneys, but give you their kidneys
Yeah, friends come in handy, but family is family

[Chorus 2]
Yeah, family is funny, they'll ask you for money
Even though they know you ain't got no money
They show up at Christmas, get up in your business
They might not be fancy, but family is family

[Outro]
You might look just like 'em; that don't mean you're like 'em
But you love 'em

[Verse 1]
I've had my picture made with Willie Nelson
Stayed in a hotel with a pool
Driven through New Mexico where the saguaro cactus grow
And I felt really small under Mount Rushmore

[Pre-Chorus]
And I made it all the way past Austin city limits
And maybe for a minute, I got too big for my britches, but

[Chorus]
I'm just a dime store cowgirl
That's all I'm ever gonna be
You can take me out of the country
But you can't take the country out of me, no
'Cause I'm still the girl from Golden
Had to get away so I could grow
But it don't matter where I'm goin'
I'll still call my hometown home

[Verse 2]
Slept in a room with the ghost of Gram Parsons
Drank some wine I can't afford
Went to San Antonio to the River Walk and the rodeo
Seen the white cliffs of Dover from the shore

[Pre-Chorus]
And I kinda fell in love with a Palm Springs trailer park
But those California stars could never steal my heart, 'cause

[Chorus]
I'm just a dime store cowgirl
That's all I'm ever gonna be
You can take me out of the country
But you can't take the country out of me, no
'Cause I'm still the girl from Golden
Had to get away so I could grow
But it don't matter where I'm goin'
I'll still call my hometown home

[Bridge]
I'm happy with what I got, 'cause what I got is all I need
Just 'cause it don't cost a lot, don't cost a lot, don't mean it's cheap

[Outro]
'Cause I'm just a dime store cowgirl
That's all I'm ever gonna be
You can take me out of the country
But you can't take the country out of me, no
'Cause I'm still the girl from Golden
Had to get away so I could grow
But it don't matter where I'm goin'
I'll still call my hometown home
Yeah, I'll still call my hometown home

[Verse 1]
I pick those tomatoes we grew off the vine
They look out the window, just killing time
I reach for the phone just to make sure it's on
And I'm fine
I put on my makeup for no one at all
My heels on the hardwood echo down the hall
And I open the wardrobe, put my face in your clothes
And I'm fine

[Chorus]
I try to sleep, I just lie here awake
I've stopped counting sheep, now I just count the days
'Til you're back in this bed that I remake every time
And if they ask, I'll say I'm fine

[Verse 2]
Just like the circus, you always leave town
I can't help but cry when that big top comes down
But I leave the light on and when you get back home
We'll be fine

[Chorus]
And I'll try to sleep but just lie here awake
I've stopped counting sheep, now I just count the days
'Til you're back in this bed that I remake every time
And if they ask, I'll say I'm fine

[Bridge]
They always say you don't get to choose
The same old cliché, love chooses you
So, baby, I'll wait just like I always do

[Chorus]
And I'll try to sleep, but just lie here awake
I've stopped counting sheep, now I just count the days
'Til you're back in this bed that I remake every time
And if they ask, I'll say I'm fine

[Outro]
Hmm, hmm

[Verse 1]
There's certain things you're s'posed to know
When you're a girl who grows up in the south
I try to use my common sense
But my foot always ends up in my mouth
And if I had to walk a runway in high heels in front of the whole town
I'd fall down
And my mama cried
When she realized

[Chorus 1]
I ain't pageant material
I'm always higher than my hair
And it ain't that I don't care about world peace
But I don't see how I can fix it in a swimsuit on a stage
I ain't exactly Ms. Congenial
Sometimes I talk before I think, I've tried to fake it but I can't
I'd rather lose for what I am than win for what I ain't

[Verse 2]
God bless the girls who smile and hug
When they're called out as a runner up on TV
I wish I could, but I just can't
Wear a smile when a smile ain't what I'm feelin'
And who's to say I'm a 9.5
Or a 4.0 if you don't even know me
Life ain't always roses and pantyhose
And...

[Chorus 1]
I ain't pageant material
I'm always higher than my hair
And it ain't that I don't care about world peace
But I don't see how I can fix it in a swimsuit on a stage
I ain't exactly Ms. Congenial
Sometimes I talk before I think, I've tried to fake it but I can't
I'd rather lose for what I am than win for what I ain't

[Intstrumental bridge]

[Chorus 2]
I ain't pageant material
The only crown is in my glass
They won't be handin' me a sash
And that's okay, cause there's no way
You'll ever see me in a swimsuit on a stage
I ain't exactly Ms. Congenial
Sometimes I talk before I think, I've tried to fake it but I can't
I'd rather lose for what I am than win for what I ain't
Yeah I'd rather lose for what I am than win for what I ain't

[Verse 1]
They're blowing up our phones, asking where we are
Just say we're almost there; we ain't even in the car
You're rolling one for two and I'm still picking out my shoes
I'm never late to the party if I'm late to the party with you

[Verse 2]
By the time we get there, everybody will be drunk
The chairs will be on tables and the band will be unplugged
We're gonna look real good, but we're gonna look real rude
I'm sorry I'm not sorry that I'm...

[Chorus]
Late to the party with you
Oh, who needs confetti?
We're already falling into the groove
And who needs a crowd when you're happy at a party for two?
The world can wait
'Cause I'm never late to the party if I'm late to the party with you

[Verse 3]
Let's promise when we get in that we'll try to get right out
Fake a couple conversations, make the necessary rounds
These kinda things just turn into "Who's leaving here with who?"
But I just want 'em all to see me come in...

[Chorus]
Late to the party with you
Oh, who needs confetti?
We're already falling into the groove
And who needs a crowd when you're happy at a party for two?
The world can wait
'Cause I'm never late to the party if I'm late to the party with you

[Chorus]
Late to the party with you
Oh, who needs confetti?
We're already falling into the groove
And who needs a crowd when you're happy at a party for two?
The world can wait
'Cause I'm never late to the party if I'm late to the party with you
No, I'm never late to the party if I'm late to the party with you

[Verse 1]
We're all hoping, we're all hopeless
We're all thorns and we're all roses
We're all looking down our noses at ourselves
We're all flawed and we're all perfect
We're all lost and we're all hurting
And just searching for somebody to love

[Verse 2]
We're all liars, we're all legends
We're all tens that want elevens
We're all trying to get to heaven, but not today
We're all happy, we're all hatin'
We're all patiently impatient
And just waiting for somebody to love

[Chorus]
We're all good, but we ain't angels
We all sin, but we ain't devils
We're all pots and we're all kettles
But we can't see it in ourselves
We're all livin' 'til we're dying
We ain't cool, but man, we're trying
Just thinking we'll be fixed by someone else

[Verse 3]
We all wrangle with religion
We all talk, but we don't listen
We're all starving for attention, then we run
We're all paper, we're all scissors
We're all fightin' with our mirrors
Scared we'll never find somebody to love

[Chorus]
We're all good, but we ain't angels
We all sin, but we ain't devils
We're all pots and we're all kettles
But we can't see it in ourselves
We're all livin' 'til we're dying
We ain't cool, but man, we're trying
Thinking we'll be fixed by someone else

[Verse 4]
Just tryin' to hold it all together
We all wish our best was better
Just hopin' that forever's really real
We'll miss a dime to grab a nickel
Overcomplicate the simple
We're all little kids just looking for love
Yeah, don't we all just want somebody to love?

[Verse 1]
I think we're thinking too hard
So put on your shoes and get in your car
Put it in drive and point it this way
We don't have to talk, you don't have to stay

[Chorus]
But I ain't got no one sleeping with me
And you ain't got nowhere that you need to be
Maybe I love you, maybe I'm just kind of bored
It is what it is 'til it ain't anymore

[Verse 2]
We've tried being apart
But the truth is we are who we are
We're so much alike, it ain't a good thing
Too dumb to give up, too stubborn to change

[Chorus]
But I ain't got no one sleeping with me
And you ain't got nowhere that you need to be
Maybe I love you, maybe I'm just kind of bored
It is what it is 'til it ain't anymore

[Bridge]
'Til something better comes along
'Til whatever we have is gone

[Chorus]
But I ain't got no one sleeping with me
And you ain't got nowhere that you need to be
Maybe I love you, maybe I'm just kind of bored
It is what it is 'til it ain't anymore
Yeah, it is what it is 'til it ain't anymore

[Chorus]
It's high time
To slow my roll
Let the grass just grow and lean way back
It's a fine time
To let it it all go
I've been too low, so it's high time

[Verse]
Been missing my roots
I'm getting rid of the flash
Nobody needs a thousand-dollar suit
Just to take out the trash
Ain't gotta be alone to feel lonely
I'm gonna turn off my phone
Start catching up with the old me

[Chorus]
It's high time
To slow my roll
Let the grass just grow and lean way back
It's a fine time
To let it it all go
I've been too low, so it's high time

[Bridge]
Been all wrong
Just wanna feel alright
Tomorrow might come crashing down
But for tonight

[Chorus]
It's high time
To slow my roll
Let the grass just grow and lean way back
It's a fine time
To let it it all go
I've been too low, so it's high time

[Outro]
I'm gonna let it all go
I've been too low, so it's high time

[Verse 1]
I don't need a membership to validate
The hard work I've put in and the dues I've paid
Never been too good at just goin' along
I guess I've always kinda been for the underdog

[Bridge 1]
Favors for friends will get you in and get you far
Shouldn't be about who it is you know
But about how good you are

[Chorus]
Don't wanna be part of the good ol' boys club
Cigars and handshakes, appreciate you, but no, thanks
Another gear in a big machine don't sound like fun to me
Don't wanna be part of the good ol' boys club

[Verse 2]
There's a million ways to dream and that's just fine
Oh, but I ain't losin' any sleep at night
And if I end up goin' down in flames
Well, at least I know I did it my own way
Hey, hey, ey, ey

[Chorus]
Don't wanna be part of the good ol' boys club
Cigars and handshakes, appreciate you, but no, thanks
Another gear in a big machine don't sound like fun to me
I don't wanna be part of the good ol' boys club

[Bridge 2]
Favors for friends will get you in and they'll get you far
But when did it become about who you know
And not about how good you are?

[Chorus]
Don't wanna be part of the good ol' boys club
Cigars and handshakes, appreciate you, but no, thanks
Another gear in a big machine don't sound like fun to me
I don't wanna be part of the good ol' boys club
I don't wanna be part of your good ol' boys club

[Verse 1]
Maybe your jacket is a hand-me down
Maybe you slept with half of your hometown
In a world of squares maybe you're just round

[Chorus 1]
You can't be everybody's cup of tea
Some like the bitter, some the sweet
Nobody's everybody's favorite, so you might as well just make it how you please
'Cause you can't be everybody's cup of tea

[Verse 2]
Maybe you're working at a hotel bar
Maybe you're still driving your high school car
Maybe you still don't know just who you are

[Chorus 1]
You can't be everybody's cup of tea
Some like the bitter, some the sweet
Nobody's everybody's favorite, so you might as well just make it how you please

[Bridge]
Oh, maybe you married the wrong person first
Maybe your hair's way too long
Your sister's in jail
Or maybe you failed out of college
But, hey, life goes on
And we've all got the right to be wrong

[Chorus 2]
'Cause you can't be everybody's cup of tea
Some like it black, some like it green
Nobody's everybody's favorite
So you might as well just make it how you please
'Cause you can't be everybody's cup of tea
Why would you wanna be?

[Verse 1]
Do we really have to grow up?
If we never do, then so what?
So what if I don't wanna, what if I'm just gonna
Stay drunk on all the years that I just wish would slow up?

[Chorus]
We can't do it over
They say it's now or never and all we're ever gettin' is older
Before we get to heaven, baby, let's give 'em hell
We might as well
'Cause we don't know when we're done
So let's love hard, live fast, die fun

[Verse 2]
Let's put a little more in your glass
Walk around and spend all our cash
Just let me grab my poncho, I don't care where we go
If we speak the language you know we don't even have to come back

[Chorus]
We can't do it over
They say it's now or never and all we're ever gettin' is older
Before we get to heaven, baby, let's give 'em hell
We might as well
'Cause we don't know when we're done
So let's love hard, live fast, die fun

[Chorus]
We can't do it over
They say it's now or never and all we're ever gettin' is older
Before we get to heaven, baby, let's give 'em hell
We might as well
'Cause we don't know when it's done
So let's love hard
Let's stay young
Let's love hard, live fast, die fun
Die fun
We can't do it over

[Verse 1]
Woke up on the wrong side of rock bottom
You're all out of pennies, and the well, it done run dry
You'd light 'em up and smoke 'em if you had 'em, but you just ain't got 'em
Yeah, ain't we always looking for a bluer sky?

[Chorus 1]
But if you're ever gonna find a silver lining
It's gotta be a cloudy day
It's gotta be a cloudy day
If you wanna fill your bottle up with lightning
You're gonna have to stand in the rain
You're gonna have to stand in the rain

[Post-Chorus]
Hoo hoo hoooo
Hoo hoo hoooo
Hoo hoo hoooo
Hoo

[Verse 2]
Lemonade keeps turning into lemons
And you wear your heart on a ripped, unraveled sleeve
Been run through the wringer and pushed plum to your limit
You say you're just unlucky, but luck ain't what you need

[Chorus 2]
'Cause if you're ever gonna find a four-leaf clover
You gotta get a little dirt on your hands
You gotta get a little dirt on your hands
And if you wanna find a head that fits your shoulder
You're gonna have to go to the dance
You're gonna have to go to the dance

[Bridge]
If you wanna find the honey
You can't be scared of the bees
And if you wanna see the forest
You're gonna have to look past the trees

[Chorus 1]
If you're ever gonna find a silver lining
It's gotta be a cloudy day
Yeah, it's gotta be a cloudy day
Ooh, and if you wanna fill your bottle up with lightning
You're gonna have to stand in the rain
You're gonna have to stand in the rain

[Post-Chorus]
Hoo hoo hoooo
Hoo hoo hoooo
Hoo hoo hoooo
Hoo

[Outro]
Hoo hoo hoooo
Hoo hoo hoooo
Hoo hoo hoooo
Hoo, hoo, hoo

[Verse 1]
Your heart's as heavy as the stones you throw
Can't see the flowers for the weeds you grow
You blow your bubbles just to watch 'em burst
For you it's always bad to worse

[Chorus]
And you... can't win unless you lose
You try to tell me you want happiness
But you ain't happy unless
You're miserable

[Verse 2]
Your neighbor's dirty laundry's cleaner
And the wolf at your door's always meaner
Your sky's still grey when the sun's around
But you can't set sail with your anchor down

[Chorus]
And you... can't win unless you lose
You try to tell me you want happiness
But you ain't happy unless
You're miserable
I'm miserable

[Bridge]
Can't laugh enough for the both of us
Be half enough for the whole of us
If misery loves company
Then I can't keep you company no more
You
You
You

[Chorus]
You... can't win unless you lose
You try to tell me you want happiness
But you ain't happy unless
You're miserable

[Verse 1]
It's all red and gold and Nat King Cole and tinsel on the tree
It's all twinkle lights and snowy nights and the kids still believe

[Refrain]
And I know that they say, "Have a happy holiday"
And every year, I sincerely try
Oh, but Christmas, it always makes me cry

[Verse 2]
It's the ones we miss, no one to kiss under the mistletoe
Another year gone by, just one more that I, I couldn't make it home

[Refrain]
And I know that they say, "Have a happy holiday"
And every year, I swear I sincerely try
Oh, but Christmas, it always makes me cry
Always

[Verse 3]
Seems like everybody else is having fun
I wonder if I'm the only one
Who's broken heart still has broken parts just wrapped in pretty paper
And it's always sad seeing mom and dad getting a little grayer

[Refrain]
And they always say, "Have a happy holiday"
And every year, I sincerely try
Oh, but Christmas, it always makes me cry

[Spoken Intro: "Memaw" Barbara Musgraves]
We had a girl that came in with a drug overdose the other day. And she got real belligerent. And she bit one of the nurses. (Oh man). And, I mean, she bit (Ohhh)—you could see every tooth (Nooo! Hehe). It took two or three of us to get her off of her. It's a crazy Wednesday

[Verse 1]
We finally got a flashing light
They put it in last year
And everybody got real happy
When the grocery store got beer
And last time the census men came a-knockin'
We were busting at the seams

[Refrain]
Aww, but don't you forget it, as big as we're getting
This town's too small to be mean

[Verse 2]
Big enough for a ZIP code
A VFW
A good Mexican restaurant
A beauty shop or two
Got a Methodist, a Baptist
And a Church of the Nazarene

[Refrain]
Aww, but don't you forget it, as big as we're getting
This town's too small to be mean
Yeah, it's too dang small to be mean

[Chorus]
Too small to be lying
Way too small to cheat
Way too small for secrets
'Cause they're way too hard to keep
And somebody's mama knows somebody's cousin
And somebody's sister knows somebody's husband
And somebody's daughter knows somebody's brother
And around here, we all look out for each other

[Verse 3]
You'll end up in the paper
Wreck your family name
What goes around comes back around
By Friday's football game
We only got one sheriff
But we all know how to keep the peace

[Refrain]
Aww, and don't you forget it, as big as we're getting
This town's too small to be mean

[Chorus]
Too small to be lying
Way too small to cheat
Way too small for secrets
'Cause they're way too hard to keep
And somebody's mama knows somebody's cousin
And somebody's sister knows somebody's husband
And somebody's daughter knows somebody's brother
And around here, we all look out for each other

[Outro]
Yeah, somebody's mama knows somebody's cousin
And somebody's sister knows somebody's husband
And somebody's daughter knows somebody's brother
And around here, we all look out for each other

[Verse 1]
Oh my God, it's you
I never thought
I'd see you here

[Verse 2]
Looks like all is well
Like you're having
A hell of a good time
Me? I'm not gonna lie

[Chorus]
Got the sunshine on my shoulders
Got a fistful of four-leaf clovers
Yeah, my cup runneth over
My sky is blue
Been kissed by Lady Luck
The stars are all lined up
Every arrow that I aim is true
But I miss you

[Verse 3]
You can't have your cake
And eat it too
I should have known

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause what good is good anyway?
And having it all is just a state of mind
And I, I got no reason to cry

[Chorus]
Got the sunshine on my shoulders
Got a fistful of four-leaf clovers
Yeah, my cup runneth over
My sky is blue
Been kissed by Lady Luck
The stars are all lined up
Every arrow that I aim is true
But I miss you

[Outro]
Been kissed by Lady Luck
The stars are all lined up
Every arrow that I aim is true
I got a big smile on my face
It's the best one I can fake
I'm as happy as half a heart can do
But I miss you

[Verse 1]
You turn on the light, then you turn it back off
’Cause sleeping alone, yeah, it ain't what you thought
It's the drip of the sink, it's the click of the clock
And you're wondering if I'm sleeping
You heard from your friends that I'm doing okay
And you're thinking that maybe you made a mistake
And you want me to know, but I don't wanna know
How you're feeling

[Chorus 1]
Keep it to yourself
If you think that you still love me
Put it on a shelf
If you're looking for someone
Make it someone else
When you're drunk, and it's late
And you're missing me like hell
Just keep it to yourself
Keep it to yourself

[Verse 2]
If you see me out and I'm standing alone
Well, it don't mean that I'm gonna need a ride home
If you walk up to me like it ain't what it is
I know that it ain't gonna end with a kiss

[Chorus 1]
So keep it to yourself
If you think that you still love me
Put it on a shelf
If you're looking for someone
Make it someone else
When you're drunk, and it's late
And you're missing me like hell
Just keep it to yourself
Keep it to yourself

[Chorus 2]
Yeah, when you're drunk, and it's late
And you're sad, and you hate
Going home alone
'Cause you're missing me like hell
Keep it to yourself
Yeah, keep it to yourself

[Outro]
Hmm
Yeah, keep it to yourself
Hmm

[Verse 1]
Between the lunch and dinner rush
Kelly caught that outbound bus for Vegas
We're all out here talking trash, making bets
Lips wrapped round our cigarettes
She always thought she was too good to be a waitress

[Pre-Chorus]
Well, we all say that we'll quit someday
When our ship comes in, we'll just sail away

[Chorus]
But we're just blowin' smoke
Hey yeah
We're just blowin' smoke
Hey yeah
Out here goin' broke
Hey yeah
We're just blowin' smoke

[Verse 2]
Well, Janie got divorced again
Her ex-husband's in the pen
From two to five, five to ten and longer
And Brenda's traded smokes for cake
Still hadn't lost that baby weight
And that baby's 'bout to graduate from college

[Pre-Chorus 2]
I'm just flicking ash into the tray
Tell them both it'll be okay

[Chorus]
But I'm just blowin' smoke
Hey yeah
I'm just blowin' smoke
Hey yeah (Hey yeah)
I'm out here goin' broke
Hey yeah
Yeah, we're just blowin' smoke

[Bridge]
We all say that we'll quit someday
When our nerves ain't shot
And our hands don't shake
We all say that we'll quit someday
When our nerves ain't shot
And our hands don't shake

[Middle 8]
Wipe down the bar, take out the trash
Light one up and count my cash
Swear I'm never coming back again

[Chorus]
I'm just blowin' smoke
Hey yeah
I'm just blowin' smoke
Hey yeah
Out here goin' broke
Hey yeah
Yeah, we're just blowin' smoke

[Chorus]
Don't need ribbons and bows to cure my woes
No, I just need your love
Expensive rings or diamond things
No, I just need your love

[Verse 1]
Don't get me wrong, a shiny new Mercedes would look nice in my driveway
Or a roundtrip ticket for a long vacation on a big fancy jet plane

[Pre-Chorus]
There's only one thing that I want
Baby, it's hard to find and it's already mine

[Chorus]
Don't need ribbons and bows to cure my woes
No, I just need your love
Expensive rings or diamond things
No, I just need your love
No, don't need much under the tree
Oh, but you can wrap me up
Ribbons and bows to cure my woes
'Cause I just need your love

[Verse 2]
All the ladies down at the hair salon are gonna brag about what they got
I walk in drippin' in their bobbles and trinkets and their whosits and whatnots

[Pre-Chorus]
There's only one thing that I want
Baby, it's hard to find and it's already mine

[Chorus]
Don't need ribbons and bows to cure my woes
No, I just need your love
Expensive rings or diamond things
No, I just need your love
No, don't need much under the tree
Oh, but you can wrap me up
Ribbons and bows to cure my woes
'Cause I just need your love

[Bridge]
Oh, I, I, I just need your love
I, I, I just need your love

[Chorus]
Don't need ribbons and bows to cure my woes
No, I just need your love
Expensive rings or diamond things
No, I just need your love
No, I don't need much under the tree
Oh, but you can wrap me up
Ribbons and bows to cure my woes
'Cause I just need your love

[Verse 1]
Picked you out and picked you up
Hoping that my luck would change
I let the summer fill my lungs
And superstition fill my brain

[Chorus]
Dandelion
A million little wishes blow
Across the sky
But it's a waste of breath and
It's a waste of time, I know
'Cause just like him
You always leave me cryin'
Dandelion

[Verse 2]
Sent you dancing on the breeze
And like a stupid little girl
I spent my wishes on a weed
Thinking it could change my world

[Chorus]
Dandelion
A million little wishes blow
Across the sky
But it's a waste of breath and
It's a waste of time, I know
'Cause just like him
You always leave me cryin'
Dandelion

[Bridge]
Falling stars and lucky pennies
Have let me down so many times before
And you're just one more
Oh, dandelion

[Chorus]
Oh, dandelion
I'm always blowing kisses out
Across the sky
But it's a waste of breath and
It's a waste of time, I know
'Cause just like him
You always leave me cryin'
Dandelion
Dandelion

[Verse 1]
You sure look real pretty in your glass house
You probably think you’re too good to take the trash out
Well, are you dumb? Are you blind?
'Cause it’s a real fine line
Between telling a joke and turning the knife
Don't wreck my reputation
Let me wreck my own

[Chorus]
Step off, step off
Yeah, you're getting too close to me
With all your negativity
Just get lost
Just try to make a little difference
Here's why you gotta interfere
Just keep climbing that mountain of dirty tricks
When you finally get to the top
Step off
Yeah–

[Verse 2]
You screwed everybody over in this town
There ain't nothing between you and the cold, hard ground
Keep running your mouth and stretching the truth
You just might find a hole in your parachute
'Cause whatever gets you high
Will always bring you down

[Chorus]
Step off, step off
Yeah, you're getting too close to me
With all your negativity
Just get lost
Just try to make a little difference
Here's why you gotta interfere
Just keep climbing that mountain of dirty tricks, yeah
And when you finally get to the top
Mmm, step off

[Bridge]
Sticks and stones
May build a throne
But you'll be up there all alone
So step off
Yeah, yeah, step off

[Outro]
And keep climbing that mountain of dirty tricks, yeah
When you finally get to the top
Step off
Mmm, just step off
Step off

[Verse 1]
We were golden, we were fire, we were magic
Yeah, and they all knew our names all over town
We had it made in the middle of the madness
We were neon in a grey crowd
Yeah, we wrote our own story
Full of blood, sweat, and heartbeats
We didn’t do it for the fame or the glory
But we went down in history

[Chorus]
Yeah, we were legends
Loving you, baby, it was Heaven
What everyone wondered, we’d never question
Close our eyes and took on the world together
Do you remember?
We were crazy
Tragic and epic and so amazing
I’ll always wear the crown that you gave me
We will always stay lost in forever
And they’ll remember
We were legends

[Verse 2]
Like we were written down in permanent marker
Not even the brightest sun could ever fade
Come whichever, Hell or high water
It was always me and you either way
Hey, we wrote our own story
Full of blood, sweat, and heartbeats
We didn’t do it for the fame or the glory
We just did it for you and me

[Chorus]
And that’s why we were legends
Loving you, baby, it was Heaven
What everyone wondered, we’d never question
Close our eyes and took on the world together
Do you remember?
We were crazy
Tragic and epic and so amazing
I’ll always wear the crown that you gave me
We will always stay lost in forever
And they’ll remember
We were legends
Oh, woah

[Chorus]
We were legends
Loving you, baby, it was Heaven
What everyone wondered, we’d never question
Close our eyes and took on the world together
Do you remember baby?
We were crazy
Tragic and epic and so amazing
I'll always wear the crown that you gave me
We will always stay lost in forever
And they’ll remember
We were legends
We were
Yeah, we were legends
Yeah, we wrote our own story

[Verse 1]
I retired my red lipstick 'cause you said you didn't like it
I didn't wear my high heel shoes
'Cause I couldn't be taller than you
I didn't wanna lose my friends, but now it's hard to even find them
It's what you wanted, ain't it?
It's what you wanted

[Pre-Chorus]
I thought I'd miss you (When it ended)
I thought it hurt me (But it didn't)
I thought I'd miss you
I thought I'd miss you

[Chorus]
But I miss me more
I miss my own beat, to my own snare drum
I miss me more
Miss my own sheets in the bed I made up
I forgot I had dreams, I forgot I had wings
Forgot who I was before I ever kissed you
Yeah, I thought I'd miss you
But I miss me more (I miss me more)

[Verse 2]
I put on my old records that I hid in the back of the closet
And I turn them up to ten
And then I played them all again
I found my independence
Can't believe I ever lost it
What you wanted, ain't it?
It's what you wanted

[Pre-Chorus]
I thought I'd miss you (When it ended)
I thought it hurt me (But it didn't)
I thought I'd miss you
Yeah, I thought I'd miss you

[Chorus]
But I miss me more
I miss my own beat, to my own snare drum
(I miss me more)
Miss my own sheets in the bed I made up
I forgot I had dreams, I forgot I had wings
Forgot who I was before I ever kissed you
Yeah, I thought I'd miss you
But I miss me more (I miss me more)

[Bridge]
I thought I'd miss you
I thought it hurt me
And I'd wanna kiss you
I thought I'd miss you

[Chorus]
But I miss me more
I miss my own beat, to my own snare drum
(I miss me more)
Miss my own sheets in the bed I made up
I forgot I had dreams, I forgot I had wings
Forgot who I was before I ever kissed you
And I thought I'd miss you
But I miss me more
(I miss me more)
(I miss me more)
(I miss me more)

[Verse 1]
I hate Shakespeare and Gosling and cakes with white frosting
Two names in a heart-shaped tattoo
I think cupid is stupid and violets are purple not blue
I hate catching bouquets, the honeymoon phase
And letterman jackets don't fit
Your eyes can't hold stars and you'd die if your heart really skipped

[Chorus]
I hate love songs
Yeah, I really do
I hate love songs
But I love you

[Verse 2]
I hate pink hearts with glitter and Valentine's dinner
And roses just die in a week
We were drunk when we met so we don't know our anniversary (Whoops)
Oh, and I'm far too vain to kiss in the rain
The clouds, they aren't numbered to nine
And you make me feel something
But it sure as hell ain't butterflies

[Chorus]
I hate love songs
Yeah, I really do
I hate love songs
But I love you
Yeah

[Interlude]
I really do

[Bridge]
And I'll always love you but I don't have to sing it
"For worse or for better" don't rhyme
They say I got the right one so now I should write one
But I'd rather just show you tonight

[Chorus]
'Cause I hate love songs
Yeah, I really do
I hate love songs
But I love you
I hate love songs
The old and the new
I hate love songs
But I love you

[Verse 1]
The smile, the charm, the words, the spark, everything, you had it
Guess I had a naive heart, 'cause boy I let you have it
You said I was your only, never thought you'd leave me lonely

[Pre-Chorus]
You're just a lost boy, with your head up in the clouds
You're just a lost boy, never keep your feet on the ground

[Chorus]
Always gonna fly away
Just because you know you can
Never gonna learn there's no such place
As Neverland, you don't understand
You'll never grow up
You're never gonna be a man, Peter Pan

[Verse 2]
Deep down, I knew that you were too good to be true
But every piece and part of me wanted to believe in you
Now it's happily ever never, I guess now I know better

[Pre-Chorus]
You're just a lost boy, with your head up in the clouds
You're just a lost boy, never keep your feet on the ground

[Chorus]
Always gonna fly away
Just because you know you can
Never gonna learn there's no such place
As Neverland, you don't understand
You'll never grow up
You're never gonna be a man, Peter Pan

[Bridge]
You're just a lost boy, yeah, I know who you are
And you don't know what you lost, boy, too busy chasing stars

[Chorus]
And you're always gonna fly away
Just because you know you can
Never gonna learn there's no such place
As Neverland, you don't understand
You'll never grow up
You're never gonna be a man
You're never grow up, yeah
You're never gonna be a man, Peter Pan
Never gonna be a man

[Verse 1]
One sided
Everything about your love was one sided
Didn't cover it up or disguise it
You used my dream against me to tie me to you
Two years too many, we tried to get it right
Hit like a shot of tequila without the lime
You've got your reasons and, yeah, I got my rhymes
So this time, this time

[Chorus]
I got myself together, got a new attitude
Hope that I see you never, I'm so over you
Got myself together, you're out of my mind
Now all that I can say is better luck next time, oh
Better luck next time, hey

[Verse 2]
We tried it
But when two hearts don't light up, you can't fight it
And in every storm, there's still silver linin'
And with every day that passes, I find it, oh

[Chorus]
I got myself together, got a new attitude
Hope that I see you never, I'm so over you
Got myself together, you're out of my mind
Now all that I can say is better luck next time, oh

[Bridge]
Blame on mistakes, but we had to roll the dice
Now all that I can say is better luck next time, yeah
Better luck next time, oh

[Chorus]
I got myself together, got a new attitude
Hope that I see you never, I'm so over you
Got myself together, you're out of my mind
Now all that I can say is better luck next time
Better luck next time, oh
Ooh, oh, ooh

[Verse 1]
I know everybody wants you
That ain't no secret
Hey baby, what's your status?
And tell me are you tryna keep it?
Well, they can all back off
'Cause I know what I want
And while I've got your attention
Did I mention:

[Chorus]
If you got a kiss on your lips that you're looking for somebody to take (hey!)
If you got a heart that ain't afraid of love, ain't afraid to break (hey!)
If you've got a Friday night free and a shotgun seat
Well, I'm just saying, I ain't got nowhere to be
So baby, I'll take whatever it is you've got to give
Yeah

[Post-Chorus]
I'm calling dibs
On your lips
On your kiss
On your time
Boy, I'm calling dibs
On your hand
On your heart
All mine

[Verse 2]
Make everybody jealous
When I take you off the market
And get my lipstick on your right cheek
Cause boy, I've gotta mark it
Oooh
So they can all back off (yeah)
'Cause I know what I want
And while I've got you listening
Come on and show me what I'm missing
Yeah

[Chorus]
If you got a kiss on your lips that you're looking for somebody to take (hey!)
If you got a heart that ain't afraid of love, ain't afraid to break (hey!)
If you've got a Friday night free and a shotgun seat
Well, I'm just saying, I ain't got nowhere to be
So baby, I'll take whatever it is you've got to give
Yeah
I'll calling dibs
If you got a kiss on your lips that you're looking for somebody to take
Hey
If you got a heart that ain't afraid of love, ain't afraid to break
Hey
If you've got a Friday night free and a shotgun seat
Well, I'm just saying, I ain't got nowhere to be
So baby, I'll take whatever it is you've got to give
Yeah

[Post-Chorus]
I'm calling dibs
On your lips
On your kiss
On your time
Boy, I'm calling dibs
On your hand
On your heart
All mine
Yeah, boy I'm calling dibs
On your lips
On your kiss
On your time
Boy, I'm calling dibs
On your hand
On your heart
All mine, yeah

[Outro]
I'm calling dibs on your lips, on your kiss, on your time, boy
I'm just tryna make you mine, boy
Oooh
Dibs

[Verse 1]
In between just a fling and a ring
In between an apartment and a front porch swing
In between cheap and fancy, a guitar and a Grammy
In between reckless and responsibility

[Chorus]
Sometimes I'm my mother's daughter
Sometimes I'm her friend
Sometimes I play grown up
And sometimes I play pretend
Sometimes I'm a princess dress, all  ribbons and all curls
And sometimes I just wanna scream "I'm not a little girl"
Dumb enough to think I know it all
Smart enough to know I don't
Young enough to think I'll live forever
Old enough to know I won't
In between

[Verse 2]
In between beer and a basement and a Napa Valley vacation
In between hometown and a neon city
In between underestimated and over-expectated
Who I was and who I'm gonna be

[Chorus]
'Cause sometimes I'm my mother's daughter
Sometimes I'm her friend
Sometimes I play grown up
And sometimes I play pretend
Sometimes I'm a princess dress, all ribbons and all curls
And sometimes I just wanna scream "I'm not a little girl"
Dumb enough to think I know it all
Smart enough to know I don't
Young enough to think I'll live forever
Old enough to know I won't
I know I won't

[Bridge]
I'm half head up in the clouds
Half feet down on the ground
'Cause it ain't as simple
As a number, sitting on a page
When they say "act your age"
But you're stuck there in the middle

[Chorus]
Sometimes I'm my mother's daughter
Sometimes I'm her friend
Sometimes I play grown up
And sometimes I play pretend
Sometimes I'm a princess dress, all ribbons and all curls
And sometimes I just wanna scream "I'm not a little girl"
Dumb enough to think I know it all
Smart enough to know I don't
Young enough to think I'll live forever
Old enough to know I won't
In the in between, yeah
In the in between

[Outro]
Hey sweet pea, it's momma
I just wanna let-cha know that I love you
Thinking about you, missing you
While you're on the road
Can't wait to see you when you get back

[Verse 1]
You saw me drive by your place last Friday
But don't make too much of it
It’s just on my way home
I didn’t see the picture that you posted in this bar
And when I pulled into the parking lot
I didn't see your car

[Pre-Chorus]
You can tell your friends it’s all on purpose
That I’m the crazy ex that wrecks your life
But there's no intentions underneath the surface
So don’t go reading anything between the lines

[Chorus]
'Cause I’m over you and everything that we used to do together
My Saturday nights are brighter, I never felt better
I didn’t miss a beat when I heard you were seeing somebody else
And I’m over you thinking that every move that I’m making
Is just a game that I’m playing because my heart is still breaking
Boy, I’m over you, I’m over you
So get over yourself, yeah
So get over yourself

[Verse 2]
You think all I do is talk about us
And that the new boy I show off is only out of spite
You’re so in your head about it
You can’t get your heart around it
But boy I’m over you
I’m over you

[Chorus]
I’m over you and everything that we used to do together
My Saturday nights are brighter, I never felt better
I didn’t miss a beat when I heard you were seeing somebody else
And I’m over you thinking that every move that I’m making
Is just a game that I’m playing because my heart is still breaking
Boy, I’m over you, I’m over you
So get over yourself

[Bridge]
Guess what else?
Took all your pictures down off of my shelf
And I don’t care enough to hate you
So I even wish you well, boy

[Pre-Chorus]
So, you can tell your friends I do it all on purpose, yeah
That I’m the crazy ex that wrecks your life

[Chorus]
But I’m over you and everything that we used to do together
My Saturday nights are brighter, I never felt better
I didn’t miss a beat when I heard you were seeing somebody else
And I’m over you thinking that every move that I’m making
Is just a game that I’m playing because my heart is still breaking
Boy, I’m over you, I’m over you
So get over yourself, yeah
So get over yourself, 'cause I’m over you
So get over yourself

[Verse 1]
They're gonna say I fell too fast
They're gonna say it's never gonna last and
Before it's too late, I should just back away
Yeah, they're gonna say that
He ain't the kind to hold my hand
He ain't gonna try to understand
Nothing under the surface
He's just looking for a pretty face

[Pre-Chorus]
But they got it all wrong
I got it all right
They say they just don't see it
But I saw it at first sight

[Chorus]
And I'm unapologetically in love
And that's unapologetically enough
No matter where it takes me
Even if it breaks me
I'm unapologetically all in
From the second that I started falling
And it don't even faze me
When they call me crazy
I'm unapologetically in love
I'm unapologetically in love, mmm, mmm

[Verse 2]
So, I could care less if I'm being careless
Might wreck me to be reckless
But I'd rather fall apart than love half-hearted
Yeah, maybe it's true that you know when you know
And then again, maybe you don't
But when you find a diamond, you can't keep it from shining

[Chorus]
And I'm unapologetically in love
And that's unapologetically enough
No matter where it takes me
Even if it breaks me
I'm unapologetically all in
From the second that I started falling
And it don't even faze me
When they call me crazy
I'm unapologetically in love
I'm unapologetically in love, mmm, mmm

[Bridge]
The life of my party
He keeps my eyes starry
So, I'm so sorry for not being sorry
I'm unapologetically in love
I'm unapologetically in love, mmm, yeah

[Chorus]
I'm unapologetically in love
And that's unapologetically enough
No matter where it takes me
Even if it breaks me
I'm unapologetically all in
From the second that I started falling
And it don't even faze me
When they call me crazy
I'm unapologetically in love
I'm unapologetically in love, mmm, mmm

[Outro]
They're gonna say I fell too fast
Yeah, they're gonna say it's never gonna last
Unapologetically

[Verse 1]
You brought one to my door
Stood there on the front porch
And that was the beginning
We had those tires spinning
Down to the green grass
Outside of town
Wild and free, never slowing down
And I thought I needed you like air

[Pre-Chorus 1]
We burned hot, burned out, like a flame
But in my head, you’ll never fade

[Chorus]
Yeah, we were classic
My dress, your leather jacket
Didn’t know how good we had it
But, boy, we had it
14th of February, gotta feeling my heart still carries
Yeah, we didn’t know it
Thought we could grow it
Beautiful for a moment
We were roses
We were roses

[Verse 2]
You put one in my hair
We danced in the middle of nowhere
You and me all summer
Bright and living color

[Pre-Chorus 2]
My lips were red
Your eyes were blue
And I thought I saw forever in you

[Chorus]
Yeah, we were classic
My dress, your leather jacket
Didn’t know how good we had it
But, boy, we had it
14th of February, gotta feeling my heart still carries
Eh, we didn’t know it
Thought we could grow it
Beautiful for a moment
We were roses

[Bridge]
But seasons had to change
And like flowers they bloom and wither away

Yeah, we were classic
My dress, your leather jacket
Didn’t know how good we had it
It was so good while it lasted

[Chorus]
We were classic
My dress, your leather jacket
Didn’t know how good we had it
But, boy, we had it
14th of February, gotta feeling my heart still carries
Yeah, we didn’t know it
Thought we could grow it
Beautiful for a moment
We were roses

We were beautiful for a moment, baby
We were roses
We were beautiful for a moment, baby
We didn’t know it
Thought we could grow it
Beautiful for a moment
We were roses

[Verse 1]
Oh hey, boy with your hat back...
Mmm, I kinda like that
If you wanna walk my way
Imma shoot you straight up
Show me what you're made of

[Pre-Chorus]
I don't have time to waste on the boys
That are playing the games
And leaving the girls crying out in the rain
So tell me, baby
Do you got what it takes?

[Chorus]
If you're gonna hold me, hold me like I'm leaving
If you're gonna kiss me, kiss me like you need it
Baby, if you're not, you best get to leaving
If you're gonna love me, love me like you mean it
If you're gonna talk the talk, you better walk it
If you wanna keep me, keep me like you lost it
If you're gonna say it and make me believe it
If you're gonna love me boy, love me like you mean it

[Verse 2]
Oh hey, I've had my share of losers, liars and users
Looking for a heart to break
So if you're like that
Well take a step back

[Pre-Chorus]
I don't have time to waste on the boys
That are playing the games
And leaving the girls crying out in the rain
So tell me, baby
Are you just crazy or crazy over me?

[Chorus]
If you're gonna hold me, hold me like I'm leaving
If you're gonna kiss me, kiss me like you need it
Baby, if you're not, you best get to leaving
If you're gonna love me, love me like you mean it
If you're gonna talk the talk, you better walk it
If you wanna  keep me, keep me like you lost it
If you're gonna say it and make me believe it
If you're gonna love me boy, love me like you mean it
If you're gonna love me, love me
If you're gonna hold me, hold me like I'm leaving
If you're gonna kiss me, kiss me like you need it
Baby, if you're not, you best get to leaving
If you're gonna love me, love me, love me
If you're gonna talk the talk, you better walk it
If you wanna keep me, keep me like you lost it
If you're gonna say it and make me believe it
If you're gonna love me boy, love me like you mean it

[Outro]
Love me like you mean it
Love me like you mean it
If you're gonna love me, love me, love me
Love me like you mean it yeah

[Verse 1]
Captured my attention, make my heart stop and listen
When you look my way
Blue jeans and a ball cap, thinking that you're all that
And I'm thinking the same
You got that something in your eyes, I think about it all the time
If you ever wonder if I wanna make you mine

[Chorus]
Yeah, boy
I'm digging what you're doing
Yeah, boy
I'm trying to keep it cool
But you're making it hard, I'm wishing your arms
Were wrapping me up tight
Yeah, boy
You shine and you can't even help it
Yeah, boy
Your eyes could make the moon jealous
And if you wanna know if I wanna be your girl tonight
Yeah, boy

[Verse 2]
Every song that's playing gets me thinking about you, baby
And the way you roll
So let's put down the drop top, burn a little blacktop
Off of that road
Baby, what we waiting on?
The stars are out, the night is young
If you wanna know if I wanna go and get gone

[Chorus]
Yeah, boy
I'm digging what you're doing
Yeah, boy
I'm trying to keep it cool
But you're making it hard, I'm wishing your arms
Were wrapping me up tight
Yeah, boy
You shine and you can't even help it
Yeah, boy
Your eyes could make the moon jealous
And if you wanna know if I wanna be your girl tonight
Yeah, boy

[Bridge]
Yeah, boy
I wanna take a little ride with you
Yeah, boy
I wanna spend a little time with you
Yeah, boy
I wanna sip a little wine with you
Oh
Yeah, boy
I wanna take a little ride with you
Yeah, boy
I wanna spend a little time with you
Yeah, boy
I wanna sip a little wine with you
Oh

[Chorus]
Yeah, boy
I'm digging what you're doing
Yeah, boy
I'm trying to keep it cool
But you're making it hard, I'm wishing your arms
Were wrapping me up tight
Yeah, boy
You shine and you can't even help it
Yeah, boy
Your eyes could make the moon jealous
And if you wanna know if I wanna be your girl tonight, yeah
Yeah, boy

[Outro]
Yeah, boy
Yeah, boy
I wanna take a little ride with you
Yeah, boy
I wanna spend a little time with you
Yeah, boy
I wanna sip a little wine with you
Oh
Yeah, boy
I wanna take a little ride with you
Yeah, boy
I wanna spend a little time with you
Yeah, boy
I wanna sip a little wine with you
Oh
Yeah, boy

[Verse 1]
I don't wanna be another skeleton in your closet
Another rose that you throw, 'cause you know that it ain't okay
Just a name on a stone in a row down the road forgotten
'Cause I was falling fast, now I'm just a dash between two dates

[Chorus 1]
And I don't wanna be another heart in your graveyard
In the cold, hard dirt that you throw down
I don't wanna watch you drive away in a black car to a new bar
So you can find another
Hopeless, broken girl in a little black dress
And you take her, break her, lay her heart to rest in peace
Right here next to me

[Verse 2]
Maybe I was naive to believe you would never hurt me
But now I know why you hide in your darkest suit and shades
You put on a show, so nobody knows
Your hands and your shoes are dirty
I guess you don't need a shovel to dig a grave

[Chorus 1]
And I don't wanna be another heart in your graveyard
In the cold, hard dirt that you throw down
I don't wanna watch you drive away in a black car to a new bar
So you can find another
Hopeless, broken girl in a little black dress
And you take her, break her, lay her heart to rest in peace
Right here next to me, yeah

[Bridge]
You gonna go out one night when you see me out
'Cause the ghost of a broken heart don't stay six feet down
Yeah, you gonna go out one night when you see me out
'Cause the ghost of a broken heart don't stay six feet down

[Chorus 2]
I don't wanna be another heart in your graveyard
In the cold, hard dirt that you throw down
I don't wanna watch you drive away in a black car to a new bar
So you can find another
Hopeless, broken girl in a little black dress
And you take her, break her, lay her heart to rest in peace
Right here next to me
Hopeless, broken girl
And you just take her, break her heart
Let her rest in peace
Right here next to me

[Outro]
I don't wanna be another heart
I don't wanna be another heart
In your graveyard, babe
In your graveyard, hey

[Verse 1]
It all starts when it's me and you, going out on Friday night
Feels like the radio when your tires roll into my drive
Then my heart stops, like a beat drop
It's a symphony when you sweet talk
Make this quiet town, feel electric, loud
When the lights going down
Every word out of your mouth

[Chorus]
Is like music
Like a 70's soundtrack
When you look at me like that
I lose it
My name on your lips, wanna replay your kiss
When I wake up, and lay down, and stay up and make out
We're not saying nothing
But it's feeling something like music

[Verse 2]
Before I knew your love
Even with the volume up, it was silent then
And now you're walking in the room all kind of smooth,  like a violin
Everybody else is white noise
So talk to me, cause your voice

[Chorus]
Is like music
Like a 70's soundtrack
When you look at me like that
I lose it
My name on your lips, wanna replay your kiss
When I wake up, and lay down, and stay up and make out
We're not saying nothing
But it's feeling something like music

I-I-I

[Bridge]
Your song on my skin is like
Ah-ah-ah-ah
So play it again just like
Ah-ah-ah-ah
Your song on my skin is like
Ah-ah-ah-ah
So play it again
My whole heart's listening to your music

[Chorus]
Like a 70's soundtrack
When you look at me like that
I lose it
My name on your lips, wanna replay your kiss
When I wake up, and lay down, and stay up and make out
We're not saying nothing
But it's feeling something like music

[Verse 1]
He's still driving that 1970 hand-me-down truck
And he's still wearing that red and black jersey
Waiting for the band to start up
He's still showing up twenty late
Finding hearts and rules to break
Why would he wanna change when
Every memory still bows to him?

[Chorus]
But this ain't high school
Where all you care about is
If the pretty cheerleader thinks you're cool
See her Friday, take her out after the football game
'Cause it's five years later and you can't get off of the elevator
That's going up, 'cause you're growing up
And the world gets cruel when you're still living in high school

[Verse 2]
He's still calling that first love, first time, pretty-eyed blonde
And she's still letting it ring 'cause his ring isn't what she wants
'Cause she traded in prom queen for a big city dream
And a slate that's clean, but
Your heart just don't get it and that's why you can't forget it
'Cause you're living like you're seventeen

[Chorus]
But this ain't high school
Where all you care about is if the pretty cheerleader thinks you're cool
See her Friday, take her out after the football game
'Cause it's five years later and you can't get off of the elevator
That's going up, 'cause you're growing up and the world gets cruel when

[Bridge]
You're still living in the hallways
Where everybody stopped and stared
And cared and knew your name
'Cause this is the real world that don't know you like that
You can remember but you can't go back

[Chorus]
To high school
Where all you care about is if the pretty cheerleader thinks you're cool
See her Friday and  take her out after the football game
'Cause it's five years later and you can't get off of the elevator
That's going up, 'cause you're growing up
And the world gets cruel when you're still living in high school

[Post-Chorus]
When you're still living in
Five years later
Oh yeah (Oh yeah, yeah), oh yeah (Oh yeah, yeah)

He's still calling that first love, first time
And he hates that he said goodbye, she went on with her life
He's still driving the same old back roads
Wondering when he got so old
Where did his life go?
Oh, but he knows
Oh, he knows
Yeah, he knows
That this ain't high school, oh, woah
And he's still driving that 1970 hand-me-down truck
And he's stuck in high school
But this ain't high school

[Verse 1]
I think I fell in love today
He thinks it's too soon to say
But my heart told me so
I don’t know exactly how it happened
It kinda felt like magic
I guess when you know, you know

[Chorus]
'Cause love don't have any rules
When gravity starts to pull
You closer to another
From a friend to a lover
Looks like forever in his eyes
That don’t happen all the time
But when it does, it changes everything
I think I fell in love today

[Verse 2]
I think I fell in love today
I'm sure he saw it on my face 'cause
I couldn't break my smile, yeah
The stars weren't lined up in a row
There was no firework show
But in that moment, he was mine

[Chorus]
'Cause love don't have any rules
When gravity starts to pull
You closer to another
From a friend to a lover
Looks like forever in his eyes
That don't happen all the time
But when it does, it changes everything
And I think I fell in love today, yeah
I think I fell in love today, yeah yeah

[Bridge]
Ask me again, a few years down the road
’Cause I guess by then, we’ll know

[Outro]
I think I fell in love today
I'm sure I’ve never felt this way with you
And I think you may just feel the same
So baby won't you say you love me too

[Verse 1]
Dark as midnight and lost in it
Insecure and just done with it
Love gave up, so I stop believing
I don’t know how to get through feelings

[Chorus]
I thought it was the end of the world
But it kept spinning round, round, round
And then the sun came up again
And I stopped looking down, down, down
I thought the stars in the sky and in my eyes had lost their shine
But just like a lifeline right on time
I met you at the end of the world

[Verse 2]
The sky kept falling, but we danced in it
I was done with love, but second chance did it
You cleared the smoke and picked up the wreckage
Got to go through Hell to get to Heaven

[Chorus]
I thought it was the end of the world
But it kept spinning round, round, round
And then the sun came up again
And I stopped looking down, down, down
I thought the stars in the sky and in my eyes had lost their shine
But just like a lifeline right on time
I met you at the end of the world, the world, the world

[Bridge]
I thought the cold would last forever
I didn’t know that there was something better
Waiting at the end of the world, the world, the world

[Chorus]
I thought it was the end of the world
But it kept spinning round, round, round
And then the sun came up again
And I stopped looking down, down, down
I thought the stars in the sky and in my eyes had lost their shine
But just like a lifeline right on time
I met you at the end of the world, the world, the world

[Outro]
I thought it was the end of the world
I thought it was
Dark as midnight and lost in it
The sky kept falling, but we danced in it

[Verse 1]
I pushed and pulled it
I let you do it too
Like it was metal
Like it was bulletproof
I forgot to cry when I was sad
I forgot to fight when I was mad
I made the moves that others would approve
But it ain’t calculated
It ain’t by the rules
And you can hate it, baby
But it’s gonna do what it’s gonna do, yeah

[Chorus]
I don’t have a machine heart
Can’t tell it to stop
No button to push to start
You’ll see it break
You’ll see it fall apart
'Cause I don’t have, I don’t have a machine heart, no
A machine heart

[Verse 2]
I kept it quiet
But now you’ll hear it scream
'Cause good or bad or right or wrong
It's finally found its beat
And it ain’t calculated
It ain’t by the rules
And you can hate it, baby
But it’s gonna do what it’s gonna do, yeah

[Chorus]
I don’t have a machine heart
Can’t tell it to stop
No button to push to start
You’ll see it break
You’ll see it fall apart
'Cause I don’t have, I don’t have a machine heart (A machine heart)
A machine heart (A machine heart)
A machine heart (A machine heart)
A machine heart (A machine heart)

[Bridge]
I won't always get it right
But hey ain't that just life?
At least you’re getting something real
I won't always get it right
But hey ain't that just life?
I want it bad, wanna feel

[Chorus]
And 'cause I don’t have a machine heart
Can’t tell it to stop
No button to push to start
You’ll see it break
You’ll see it fall apart
'Cause I don’t have, no I don’t have a machine heart (A machine heart)
A machine heart (A machine heart)

[Partial-Verse 1]
I pushed and pulled it
I let you do it, too
I let you do it, too
I pushed and pulled it
I let you do it, too
I let you do it, too

[Outro]
But I don’t have a machine heart
No I don’t have a machine heart

[Verse 1]
I put on my make up
Spray my perfume
Sat on the front porch, waitin' on you
Said we would catch up because it had been awhile
I hate to admit it
But my hands are shaking
Barely breathin'
Heart is racin'
Looks like feelings don't always change their minds

[Pre-Chorus 1]
But you never called, never showed up
Guess some things never change
And just like living in a flashback, you let me down again

[Chorus]
And that's why the past should be the past
Far behind, back of mind, out of the way
Let the memories burn and crash
'Cause sittin' here lookin' at the driveway
Is just tearin' my heart back in half
Like nothing's changed, except the time that's passed
And that's why good-bye should mean good-bye
The first time

[Verse 2]
I should know better
I hate that I still cry
Lookin' like a fool here watchin' for headlights
And kickin' myself for believin' in you again
I bet your out drinkin' with a new blonde and
Telling her whatever's playin' is her song
Yeah, and helping her up into your Chevy instead

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Even when you don't have me
You can still be the one to hurt me
It must feel good to know that I'm still holdin' on to letting go

[Chorus]
And that's why the past should be the past
Far behind, back of mind, out of the way
Let the memories burn and crash
'Cause sittin' here lookin' at the driveway
Is just tearin' my heart back in half
Like nothing's changed, except the time that's passed
And that's why good-bye should mean good-bye
The first time

[Bridge]
Yeah, that's why the past should be the past
Far behind, back of mind, out of the way
Let the memories burn and crash
Cause sittin' here looking at this driveway

[Chorus]
Is just tearin my heart back in half
Like nothing's changed except the time that's passed
And that's why good-bye should mean good-bye
So now I'm letting you go, just like I shoulda tried
The first time
The first time, oh yeah

[Outro]
Yeah, that's why the past should be the past, oh
The first time
Yeah

[Verse 1]
Hey, it's cool, I know, I'll see you around
It ain't like this is the end of our merry-go-round
So we don't need to be dramatic about it, baby
We know that "no" is another word for "maybe"
And "maybe" is another word for "come over"

[Chorus]
'Cause it's all fun and games
It's all poker face
Three a.m., your place
You hold me close like you do your cards
Can't tell the joker from the queen of hearts or the queen of spades
It's all "go" then "stay", every time you call me, hey
It's all fun and it's all games 'til someone doesn't wanna play, play, ay
Doesn't wanna play, play, ay

[Verse 2]
We're no good at goodbye and that's why we're stuck in the in-between
'Cause every time I'm fine, I'm not, and you're lonely
And I know you and I lay it all on the table
But a Saturday night doesn't have to be fatal
And who cares, anyway, about a label?

[Chorus]
'Cause it's all fun and games
It's all poker face
Three a.m., your place
You hold me close like you do your cards
Can't tell the joker from the queen of hearts or the queen of spades
It's all "go" then "stay", every time you call me, hey
It's all fun and it's all games 'til someone doesn't wanna play, play, ay
Doesn't wanna play, play, ay

[Bridge]
Maybe one day, we'll fold when we find out
We got nothing left up our sleeves but this showdown
But for now, well

[Chorus]
It's all fun and games
It's all poker face
Three a.m., your place
You hold me close like you do your cards
Can't tell the joker from the queen of hearts or the queen of spades
It's all "go" then "stay", every time you call me, hey
It's all fun and it's all games 'til someone doesn't wanna play, play, ay
Doesn't wanna play, play, ay

[Outro]
Yeah, you think you have the upperhand
'Til you see the other hand
Think you have the upper hand
'Til you see the other hand
So hey, it's cool, I know, I'll see you around
It ain't like this is the end of our merry-go-round

[Verse 1]
Go ahead and say what you're gonna say
Give it to me straight, don't sugarcoat it
Go ahead and do what you're gonna do
We're already done, I already know it
So you can take your new blonde out to get your drink on
For everyone to see
But you don't get to get to me

[Chorus]
I'll wear my pain like stilettos
As bad as it may hurt, no, you'll never know
I'll keep walking with my head up, putting on a show
And fronting like nothing is wrong
I talk the talk like I'm a tough girl
Cause there ain't room for weakness in a rough world
That keeps saying you were never enough, girl
Yeah, when you get burned, you learn to be strong
I'll wear my pain like stilettos

[Verse 2]
So I ain't staying down, tonight I'm going out
Yeah, even if I have to fake it
A little black dress to cover my mess
So you won't know my heart is breaking
Pull myself together from the fallout of forever
For everyone to see
No, you don't get to get to me

[Chorus]
I'll wear my pain like stilettos
As bad as it may hurt, no, you'll never know
I'll keep walking with my head up, putting on a show
And fronting like nothing is wrong
I talk the talk like I'm a tough girl
Cause there ain't room for weakness in a rough world
That keeps saying you were never enough, girl
Yeah, when you get burned, you learn to be strong
I'll wear my pain like stilettos

[Bridge]
Oh, oh, whoa, oh, whoa
Whoa, oh, whoa, oh, whoa
Whoa, oh, whoa, oh, whoa
Oh, whoa, oh, whoa, oh

[Chorus]
I'll wear my pain like stilettos
As bad as it may hurt, no, you'll never know
I'll keep walking with my head up, putting on a show
And fronting like nothing is wrong
I talk the talk like I'm a tough girl
Cause there ain't room for weakness in a rough world
That keeps saying you were never enough, girl
Yeah, when you get burned, you learn to be strong
I'll wear my pain like stilettos
Yeah,I'll wear my pain like stilettos

[Outro]
Oh, oh, whoa, oh, whoa
Whoa, oh, whoa, oh, whoa
Whoa, oh, whoa, oh, whoa
Oh, whoa, oh, whoa, oh
Yeah

[Verse 1]
Two sets of lips on a Pepsi-Cola
In the middle of the summertime heat you kept it cool
We were west coast kids ridin' 'round in your Chevy Nova
Said you'd come back for me when you had to leave to go back to school

[Chorus]
But we were like fire
Summer breeze, seventies, all-nighter
Let the beach be the background choir
Singing like oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
We were like a movie
Said I looked too good in that two-piece
And for those three months you knew me
Remember those, remember those nights?
We were like
Yeah, we were like

[Verse 2]
Bare feet and blue eyes on the boardwalk
We were counting the stars and the days 'til you had to go
Since then nobody ever made my heart stop
Like you did when we lived in that summer glow

[Chorus]
'Cause we were like fire
Summer breeze, seventies, all-nighter
Let the beach be the background choir
Singing like oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
We were like a movie
Said I looked too good in that two-piece
And for those three months you knew me
Remember those, remember those nights?
We were like
Yeah, we were like

[Bridge]
Slow dance, romance, sundress, sunshine
Your name, cool rain, so good 'til goodbye
We were like

[Chorus]
We were like fire
Summer breeze, seventies, all-nighter
Let the beach be the background choir
Singing oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
We were like a movie
Said I looked too good in that two-piece
And for those three months you knew me
Remember those, remember those nights?
We were like
Yeah, we were like

[Outro]
Slow dance, romance, sundress, sunshine
Your name, cool rain, so good 'til goodbye, yeah
Tan skin, golden tattoo, your smile
The end, pretend forever for a while
We were like

[Intro]
La da da da da da da da da
La da da da da da da da da

[Verse One]
What if we were all the same?
Same rules, same game
And we weren't allowed to change anything about anything
That anybody's ever done before?
Wouldn't that be boring?, yeah

Always spinning on a ride, all walking on a line
That they drew a long time ago
When you know that you don't have to go where they go
You can go write your own story


[Pre-Chorus]
Hey, hey, you gotta be
Who you oughta be
So who do you wanna be?
Oh

[Chorus]
You can choose if you're bad, if you're good
If you're left or right, speaking your heart or speaking your mind
You can be what they say, you can be a cliche
You can tear up the box and throw it away
Everybody gotta be themselves
Everybody gotta dream out loud
Everybody gotta be themselves
Square pegs make the world go 'round

La da da da da da da da da
La da da da da da da da da

La da da da da da da da da

[Verse Two]
There's a lot of open doors you can go and explore
You can always open more if you're hitting a wall
Dropping the ball, haven't we all
Been down that same hallway?
So let 'em talk and whisper, let 'em try to fix ya
Repaint your picture, at the end of the day
It fits in your frame, just cause you're different don't mean you're crazy


[Pre-Chorus]
Hey, hey, you gotta sing
Like nobody's listening
Cause somebody's listening, yeah
Oh

[Chorus]
You can choose if you're bad, if you're good
If you're left or right, speaking your heart or speaking your mind
You can be what they say, you can be a cliche
You can tear up the box and throw it away
Everybody gotta be themselves
Everybody gotta dream out loud
Everybody gotta be themselves
Square pegs make the world go 'round
They make the world go 'round

[Pre-Chorus]
Hey, hey, you gotta be
Who you oughta be
So who do you wanna be?
Whoa, oh

[Chorus]
You can choose if you're bad, if you're good
If you're left or right, speaking your heart or speaking your mind
You can be what they say, you can be a cliche
You can tear up the box and throw it away
Everybody gotta be themselves
Everybody gotta dream out loud
Everybody gotta be themselves
Square pegs make the world go 'round

[Outro]
Hey, you gotta be
Who you wanna be, so
Who do you wanna be?
Square pegs make the world go 'round

Hey, you gotta be
Who you wanna be, so
Who do you wanna be?
Square pegs make the world go 'round

[Verse 1]
You might be sitting here holding my hand
You might be acting like you're my man
While we listen to the cover band
Thinking you're a rock star
Singing my favorite song
Trying to cover up the fact
That the girl from your past
Hasn't been here all along

[Chorus]
You're still in love with your ex, oh
And I ain't one to be nobody's second best, no
Stop holding onto me when the truth is you can't let go
And I think we both know
I'm looking in your eyes and I can see just what you're doing baby
I'm the one you're losing, you can't help it
You keep choosing your ex, oh

[Verse 2]
Well I might be platinum blonde, but I ain't dumb
Baby I see, you're here with me but you ain't moved on
Sitting in the middle of a flame still burning
Boy, I ain't your match
You can stop all the pretending cause when the night's ending
You're still gonna want her back

[Chorus]
You're still in love with your ex, oh
And I ain't one to be nobody's second best, no
Stop holding onto me when the truth is you can't let go
And I think we both know
I'm looking in your eyes and I can see just what you're doing baby
I'm the one you're losing, you can't help it
You keep choosing your ex, oh

[Bridge]
You're still in love with your
You're still in love with your

[Chorus 2]
Yeah, you're still in love with your ex, oh
And I ain't one to be nobody's second best, no
Stop holding onto me when the truth is you can't let go
I think we both know
Yeah, I think we both know

[Chorus]
You're still in love with your ex, oh
And I ain't one to be nobody's second best, no
Stop holding onto me when the truth is you can't let go
And I think we both know
I'm looking in your eyes and I can see just what you're doing baby
I'm the one you're losing, you can't help it
You keep choosing your ex, oh

You're still in love with your ex

Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah

You're still in love with your ex, oh

You're still in love with your ex

Sometimes you could hear a pin drop or the ticking of the clock
Between the surface conversation, no matter what they were saying
They never talked
Sometimes I would hear 'em screaming, when they thought that I was sleeping
They'd just fight about whatever, I don't know if they ever had a reason

[Pre-Chorus]
Am I the product of a problem that I couldn't change?
Got his eyes, got her hair
So do I get their mistakes?

[Chorus]
I know that you can't walk across a bridge that's already burned, so
What am I supposed to do?, I can't help that they chose
To breathe it in, but I don't wanna choke
On that secondhand smoke

Sometimes I hear myself saying hand-me-down words
It's so easy to forget that he ain't him and I ain't her

[Pre-Chorus]
And when I think the fighting has to end in a goodbye
I wanna prove me wrong, but I'm scared I'll prove me right, cause

[Chorus]
I know that you can't walk across a bridge that's already burned, so
What am I supposed to do?, I can't help that they chose
To breathe it in, but I don't wanna choke
On that secondhand smoke
Oh, no

Will I be better, find forever, be the one to shake the habit
Break away from broken things, and rise above the ashes?

I know that you can't walk across a bridge that's already burned, so
What am I supposed to do?, I can't help that they chose
To breathe it in, but I don't wanna choke
On that secondhand smoke
Oh

[Verse 1]
Young
All we ever think about is fun
All we ever wanna be is 21
Hey, doesn't everyone wanna sit on top of the world?
Revolves around athletic boys and girls
Dressed up in their older sister's clothes, R. Kelly on the radio
Screaming out, "This'll never get old"

[Chorus]
Racing cars and breaking hearts
First taste of love and twist-off wine
Kissing strangers, daring danger
Burning bridges, crossing lines
You don't think to take it slow
And you don't know what you don't know
The nights are young and our IDs are fake
Underage
Underage

[Verse 2]
Time
Feels like it's always on our side
So we fill it up with midnight drives and lies
To your mama when she asks you where you've been
And you hide your smile and say anywhere but with him
Cause you know when she was seventeen
She was doing the same damn thing

[Chorus]
Racing cars and breaking hearts
First taste of love and twist-off wine
Kissing strangers, daring danger
Burning bridges, crossing lines
You don't think to take it slow
And you don't know what you don't know
The nights are young and our IDs are fake
Underage
Underage

[Bridge]
Every light is saying "go"
When you don't know what you don't know

[Chorus]
Racing cars and breaking hearts
First taste of love and twist-off wine
Kissing strangers, daring danger
Burning bridges, crossing lines
You don't think to take it slow
And you don't know what you don't know
The nights are young and our IDs are fake
The kind of days that are "those were the days"
Underage
Underage

[Outro]
Young
All we ever think about is fun
Doesn't everyone?

The night is young and so are we, so you what you say
We go and see it all for ourselves?
Yeah, yeah
There's a spot I know down the road we can go
Only me and you and no one else
Yeah, yeah

I ain't looking for a crowd
Another night on the town
I want a one way ticket where the creaking crickets
Are the only sound

So baby, pick me up, I'll be in the drive
Take me where the moon's hanging in the sky
We can park it by the river, get out and throw the tailgate down down down
You can steal a kiss, maybe even two
Only the track and the tree's gonna see what we do
All I wanna be is wrapped in your arms, laying in the dark
Looking at stars

We can rename constellations while we're making wishes
Don't it make you feel so small?
Yeah, yeah
We can talk about forever for a minute, maybe never
Just kiss and say nothing at all
Yeah, yeah

Baby, hurry up and get here
So we can disappear
The clouds are breaking, don't keep me waiting
Never seeing a night this clear

So baby, pick me up, I'll be in the drive
Take me where the moon's hanging in the sky
We can park it by the river, get out and throw the tailgate down down down
You can steal a kiss, maybe even two
Only the track and the tree's gonna see what we do
All I wanna be is wrapped in your arms, laying in the dark
Looking at stars

I ain't looking for a crowd
Another night on the town
I want a one way ticket where the creaking crickets
Are the only sound

So baby, pick me up, I'll be in the drive
Take me where the moon's hanging in the sky
We can park it by the river, get out and throw the tailgate down down down
You can steal a kiss, maybe even two
Only the track and the tree's gonna see what we do
All I wanna be is wrapped in your arms, laying in the dark
Looking at stars

Oh, yeah
Oh, yeah

Just looking at stars

[Verse 1]
I took two weeks vacation for the honeymoon
A couple tickets all inclusive down in Cancun
I couldn't get my money back so I'm in seat 7A
I'm getting drunk on a plane
I bet the fella on the aisle thought I was crazy
Cause I taped your picture to the seatback right beside me
Now I've got empty mini bottles fillin' both our trays
I'm getting drunk on a plane

[Chorus]
Buyin' drinks for everybody
But the pilot, it's a party
Got this 737 rocking like a G6
Stewardess is somethin' sexy
Leanin' pourin' Coke and whiskey
Told her about my condition
Got a little mile-high flight attention
It's Mardi Gras up in the clouds
I'm up so high, I may never come down
I'll try anything to drown out the pain
They all know why I'm getting drunk on a plane

[Verse 2]
We had this date marked on the calendar forever
We'd take that new wed limo airport ride together
I feel like a plastic groom alone there at the top of the cake
So hey, I'm getting drunk on a plane

[Chorus]
Buyin' drinks for everybody
But the pilot, it's a party
Got this 737
Rocking like a G6
Stewardess is somethin' sexy
Leanin' pourin' Coke and whiskey
Told her about my condition
Got a little mile-high flight attention
It's Mardi Gras up in the clouds
I'm up so high, I may never come down
I'll try anything to drown out the pain
They all know why I'm getting drunk on a plane

[Verse 3]
On my way home I'll bump this seat right up to first class
So I can drink that cheap champagne out of a real glass
And when we land I'll call her up and tell her kiss my ass
Cause hey, I'm drunk on a plane

[Chorus]
Buyin' drinks for everybody
But the pilot, it's a party
Got this 737
Rocking like a G6
Stewardess is somethin' sexy
Leanin' pourin' Coke and whiskey
Told her about my condition
Got a little mile-high flight attention
It's Mardi Gras up in the clouds
I'm up so high, I may never come down
I'll try anything to drown out the pain
They all know why I'm getting drunk on a plane

[Outro]
I'm getting drunk on a plane
I might be passed out
In the baggage claim
But right now
I'm drunk on a plane

[Verse 1]
If it wasn't known, that our love will carry on
I will be the wind that echo's on the canyon wall
One more day with you, to walk around our neighbourhood
We will never know like it was understood

[Chorus]
We never say goodbye
Just let me hold the light

[Verse 2]
If you've given up, I will call an end to this
I will be your rock from our perch
If you walk the ridge, you will find the marks, the scars
Kneel down by the tree, under the city stone

[Chorus]
We never say goodbye
Just let me hold the light

We never say goodbye
I'll see you on this side
Or the other way
The desert sun kisses the sky
Baby hold the light
And keep it in your eyes
And promise that you dream with me
Beyond the walls of time
And when we laid aside
Just look up at the light

[Outro]
Just let me hold the light
Just let me hold the light

[Verse 1]
Half your life you struggle
Half your life you fly
Half your life makin' trouble
Half your life makin' it right
One day I'm the exception
Most days I'm just like most
Some days I'm headed in the right direction
And some days I ain't even close

[Chorus]
I'm a little bit steady but still a little bit rollin' stone
I'm a little bit heaven but still a little bit flesh-and-bone
Little found, little don't-know-where-I-am
I'm a little bit holy water but still a little bit burning man
Burning man

[Verse 2: TJ Osborne]
I always loved the highway
I just don't run it as fast
I still go wherever the wind blows me
But I always find my way back
I still don't get it right sometimes
I just don't get it as wrong
I still go a little bit crazy sometimes
Yeah, but now I don't stay near as long

[Chorus]
I'm a little bit steady but still a little bit rollin' stone
I'm a little bit heaven but still a little bit flesh-and-bone
Little found, little don't-know-where-I-am
I'm a little bit holy water but still a little bit burning man
Burning man
Still just a burn, burn, burning man
Just a burning man
Woo!

[Bridge]
Maybe I'll go to the desert
Find myself in the Joshua Tree
If we pass in the night then just hand me a light
And tell me you burned just like me

[Chorus]
I'm a little bit steady but still a little bit rollin' stone
I'm a little bit heaven but still a little bit flesh-and-bone
Little found, little don't-know-where-I-am
I'm a little bit holy water but still a little bit burning man
Burning man
Still just a burn, burn, burning man
Just a burning man

[Outro]
Burning man

[Verse 1]
This mornin' I got up at 6:01
I walked out and saw the rising sun
And I drank it in like whiskey
I saw a tree I've seen a thousand times
A bird on a branch and I watched it fly away in the wind
And it hit me
It's a beautiful world sometimes I don't see so clear

[Chorus]
Some days you just breath in
Just try to break even
Sometimes your heart's poundin' out of your chest
Sometimes it's just beatin'
Some days you just forget
What all you've been given
Some days you just get by
And some days you're just alive
Some days you're livin'
Some days you're livin'

[Verse 2]
I went back in and fired the coffee up
She walked in the kitchen like she always does
In my t-shirt and it killed me
And I kissed her like it was the first time
She laughed and looked at me like I'd lost my mind
I said "Baby, I love you, can't live without you, I know I don't say it enough"

[Chorus]
Some days you just breath in
Just try to break even
Sometimes your heart's poundin' out of your chest
Sometimes it's just beatin'
Some days you just forget
What all you've been given
Some days you just get by
And some days you're just alive
Some days you're livin'
Some days you're livin'

[Post-Chorus]
Like you never die
Blue's a little bluer up in the sky
You're high's a little high
You feel that fire you've been missing
Some days you're living

It'a beautiful world sometimes I don't see so clear

[Chorus]
Some days you start singin'
And you don't need a reason
Sometimes the world's just right
Your clear eyes ain't even blinkin'
Got a heart full of grateful
For all you've been given
Some days you just get by
Yeah some days you're just alive
Some days you're livin'
Some days you're livin'

[Post-Chorus]
Livin' like you'll never die
Blue's a little bluer up in the sky
You're high's a little high
You feel that fire you've been missin'
Some days you're living
Some days you're living

[Intro]
Oh oh oh oh ohhhhhh oh
Oh oh oh oh ohhhh
Oh oh oh oh ohhhhhh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh

[Verse 1]
I'd lose my way and I'd lose my mind
If I faced one day on my own
I know I was saved
The night that she gave this drifter's heart a home

[Chorus]
Every night I should be on my knees
Lord knows how lucky I am
I'll never say near enough
Thank God for this woman, amen

[Refrain]
Oh oh oh oh ohhhhhh oh
Oh oh oh oh ohhhh

[Verse 2]
This world has a way of shaking your faith
I've been broken again and again
But I need all the cracks in my shattered heart
'Cause that's where her love gets in

[Chorus]
Every night I should be on my knees
Lord knows how lucky I am
I'll never say near enough
Thank God for this woman, amen

[Post Chorus]
She gives me faith (Oh oh oh oh ohhhh)
She gives me grace (Oh oh oh oh ohhhh)
She gives me hope (Oh oh oh oh ohhhh)
She gives me strength (Oh oh oh oh ohhhh)
She gives me love (Oh oh oh oh ohhhh)
Love without end (Oh oh oh oh ohhhh)
Thank God for this woman, amen (Oh oh oh oh ohhhh)

[Refrain]
Oh oh oh oh ohhhhhh oh
Oh oh oh oh ohhhh
Oh oh oh oh ohhhhhh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh

[Bridge]
Thanks for the moon and the stars up above
Forgiveness of sin in Your undying love
Every twist every turn for the way You made sure
All my roads led to her

[Chorus]
So tonight I will fall down on my knees
'Cause Lord knows how lucky I am
I'm gonna shout at the top of my lungs
Thank God for this woman, amen
And thank God for this woman, amen

[Outro]
She gives me faith (Oh oh oh oh ohhhh)
She gives me grace (Oh oh oh oh ohhhh)
She gives me hope (Oh oh oh oh ohhhh)
She gives me strength (Oh oh oh oh ohhhh)
She gives me love (Oh oh oh oh ohhhh)
Love without end (Oh oh oh oh ohhhh)
Thank God for this woman, amen (Oh oh oh oh ohhhh)

[Verse 1]
The moon outside
Too bright
Those blinds, yeah, let's just keep 'em closed, you know
My hands, they know where to go
To find your finger tips
Trace 'em back to your lips
Take you on a trip
Flip that switch

[Chorus]
Make my world go black
Hit me like a heart attack
Knock me flat on my back, yeah, just keep doing that
That thing you're doing there
Brush me with your hair
I swear I don't know how long that I can last
Make my world go black, black
Make my world go black, black

[Verse 2]
Like your dress on the floor
Yeah the one you don't need anymore
Black like a sky with no stars
Just find me and fall into my arms

[Chorus]
And make my world go black
Hit me like a heart attack
Knock me flat on my back, yeah, just keep doing that
That thing you're doing there
Brush me with your hair
I swear I don't know how long that I can last
Make my world go black, black
Make my world go black, black

[Bridge]
I don't wanna see a thing
Baby I just wanna feel your touch, feel your rush
I don't wanna see a thing
I just wanna feel your love

[Chorus]
Make my world go black
Hit me like a heart attack
Knock me flat on my back, yeah, just keep doing that
That thing you're doing there
Brush me with your hair
I swear I don't know how long that I can last
Make my world go black, black
Make my world go black, black

[Outro]
Make my world go black, black
I don't wanna see a thing
(Black, black)
I just wanna feel your touch, feel your rush
(Black, black)
(Black, black)

[Verse 1]
Bet you think I'm sitting at home, naw
Bet you think that I'm all alone, naw
I bet you think I'm missing you and wishing you would call my phone
Hell naw
I went wheels up on a runway
And that ticket was a one-way

[Chorus]
I'm somewhere on a beach
Sipping something strong
Got a new girl, she got it going on
We drink all day, and party all night
I'm way too gone to have you on my mind
She got a body, and she's naughty
And she got me like you ain't never got me
I'm getting sun, getting some, and I ain't slept in a week
Yeah, I'm somewhere on a beach

[Verse 2]
Heard you called my boys
Heard you called my folks
They said you drove by my house real slow
You can check any spot, roll down every road
But girl, I ain't even close

[Chorus]
I'm somewhere on a beach
Sipping something strong
Got a new girl, she got it going on
We drink all day, and party all night
I'm way too gone to have you on my mind
She got a body, and she's naughty
And she got me like you ain't never got me
I'm getting sun, getting some, and I ain't slept in a week
Yeah, I'm somewhere on a beach

[Bridge]
I wish it could've worked out
But I'm gettin' over you now
On a beach towel
My shades on
My drink's up and the sun's out
I'm somewhere on a beach

[Chorus]
I'm somewhere on a beach
Sipping something strong
Got a new girl, she got it going on
We drink all day, and party all night
I'm way too gone to have you on my mind
She got a body, and she's naughty
And she got me like you ain't never got me
I'm getting sun, getting some, and I ain't slept in a week
Yeah, I'm somewhere on a beach

[Outro]
Yeah, I'm somewhere on a beach

[Verse 1: Dierks Bentley]
She don't throw any t-shirt on and walk to a bar
She don't text her friends and say, "I gotta get laid tonight."
She don't say, "It's okay, I never loved him anyway."
She don't scroll through her phone just looking for a Band-Aid

[Chorus: Both]
It's different for girls when their hearts get broke
They can't tape it back together with a whiskey and Coke
They don't take someone home and act like it's nothing
They can't just switch it off every time they feel something
A guy gets drunk with his friends and he might hook up
Fast forward through the pain, pushing back when the tears come on
But it's different for girls

[Verse 2: Elle King (Both)]
She don't sleep all day and leave the house a wreck
She don't have the luxury to let herself go
(She won't call just to curse
Found a wall she can punch
When the going gets tough, yeah, the guys they can just act tough)

[Chorus: Both]
It's different for girls when their hearts get broke
They can't tape it back together with a whiskey and Coke
They don't take someone home and act like it's nothing
They can't just switch it off every time they feel something
A guy gets drunk with his friends and he might hook up
Fast forward through the pain, pushing back when the tears come on
But it's different for girls

[Bridge: Dierks Bentley]
It's different for girls
Nobody said it was fair
When love disappears, they can't pretend it was never there

[Outro: Both]
A guy gets drunk with his friends and he might hook up
Fast forward through the pain, pushing back when the tears come on
When the going gets tough, yeah, the guys they can just act tough
So tough
It's different for girls
It's different for girls

[Verse 1]
Becky was a beauty from south Alabama
Her daddy had a heart like a nine-pound hammer
Think he even did a little time in the slammer
What was I thinking?
She snuck out one night and met me by the front gate
Her daddy came out waving that twelve gauge
We tore out the drive he peppered my tailgate
What was I thinking?

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, I knew there'd be hell to pay
But that crossed my mind a little too late
Cause I was

[Chorus]
Thinking about a little white tank top sitting right
There in the middle by me
I was thinking about a long kiss man just got to get
Going where a night might lead
I know what I was feeling
But what was I thinking... what was I thinking

[Verse 2]
By the county line the cops were nipping on our heels
Pulled off the road and kicked it in four-wheel
Shut off the lights and tore through the corn field
What was I thinking?
Out the other side she was hollering faster
Took a dirt road and had the radio blasting
Hit the honky tonk for a little close dancing
What was I thinking?

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, I knew there'd be hell to pay
But that crossed my mind a little too late
Cause I was

[Chorus]
Thinking about a little white tank top sitting right
There in the middle by me
I was thinking about a long kiss man just got to get
Going where a night might lead
I know what I was feeling
But what was I thinking... what was I thinking

[Verse 3]
When a mountain of a man with a "born to kill" tattoo
Tried to cut in I knocked out his front tooth
We ran outside hood-sliding like Bo Duke
What was I thinking?
I finally got her home at a half past too late
Her daddy's in a lawn chair sitting on the driveway
Put it in park as he started my way
What was I thinking, oh what was I thinking
Then she gave a come-and-get-me grin
And like a bullet we were gone again... cause I was

[Chorus]
Thinking about a little white tank top sitting right
There in the middle by me
I was thinking about a long kiss man just got to get
Going where a night might lead
I know what I was feeling
But what was I thinking... what was I thinking

[Verse 1]
Well I bet my soul on a six string gamble
And I climb like hell through the brush and the bramble
Even though I had my doubts, told myself don't look down
And I turned that hill into a pile of gravel

[Chorus]
It was only a mountain, nothing but a big ol' rock
Only a mountain, it ain't hard if you don't stop
It just took a little step, a right then a left
Then a couple million more, who's counting?
Yeah, that's only a mountain

[Verse 2]
Well you better know the bottom if you wanna be a climber
'Cause there's always another one a little bit higher
Just when I think I'm finally done I'm staring at another one
So I reach down deep and I lace 'em up tighter

[Chorus]
It was only a mountain, nothing but a big ol' rock
Only a mountain, it ain't hard if you don't stop
It just took a little step, a right then a left
Then a couple million more, who's counting?
Yeah, that's only a mountain

[Bridge]
Now I'm standing at the top with the sweat behind me
Yeah, you gotta look up if you ever wanna find me

[Chorus]
It was only a mountain, nothing but a big ol' rock
Only a mountain, it ain't hard if you don't stop
It just took a little step, a right then a left
Now I'm standing at the top just shouting
Yeah, that's only a mountain
It's only a mountain, it's only a mountain
Only a mountain
Only a mountain, it was only a mountain

[Verse 1: Dierks Bentley]
The phone lights up in the dark
Asks where you are and I start driving
Meet me for a drink
Just an hour, maybe two, maybe three
Baby I'm in
Girl, you can't take your eyes off me
And that first kiss is sweet relief
Ain't no one gotta know
Just one more before you go

[Chorus: Both]
I don't wanna be a liar
I don't wanna be a fool
I don't wanna be a secret
But I will if you want me to
You can leave me in the dark
If that's all I get from you
He can be the sun
I'll be the moon
Yeah, he can be the sun
I'll be the moon

[Verse 2: Dierks Bentley and Maren Morris]
The phone lights up in the dark
Gotta go I know but it still ain't easy
Tomorrow you'll be waking up beside him
Tell him that you love him
But you still see me
In my mind when I'm looking at him
And in my eyes
It's the obvious elephant in the room
He can't see it, but girl you do

[Chorus: Both]
I don't wanna be a liar
I don't wanna be a fool
I don't wanna be a secret
But I will if you want me to
You can leave me in the dark
If that's all I get from you
He can be the sun
I'll be the moon
Yeah, he can be the sun
I'll be the moon

[Bridge: Dierks Bentley]
The phone lights up in the dark
Yes it's my turn, and I start driving

[Chorus: Both]
I don't wanna be a liar
I don't wanna be a fool
I don't wanna be a secret
But this is something I can't lose
You can leave me in the dark
If that's all I get from you
He can be the sun
I'll be the moon
He can be the sun
I'll be the moon

[Outro: Dierks Bentley]
Phone lights up in the dark

[Verse 1]
It's just an old beat up truck
Some say that I should trade up
Now that I got some jangle in my pocket
But what they don’t understand
Is it's the miles that make a man
I wouldn’t trade that thing in for a rocket
What they don’t know is my dad and me–
We drove her out to Tennessee
And she’s still here and now he’s gone
So I hold on

[Verse 2]
It's just an old beat up box
Its rusty strings across the top
It probably don’t look like much to you
But these dents and scratches in the wood
Yeah, that’s what makes it sound so good
To me it's better than brand new
You see this here flat top guitar
Has had my back in a million bars
Singing every country song
So I hold on

[Chorus]
To the things I believe in
My faith, your love, our freedom
To the things I can count on
To keep me going strong
Yeah, I hold on, I hold on
Like the stripes to the flag
Like a boy to his dad
I can't change who I am, right or wrong
So I hold on

[Verse 3]
Yeah, baby, looking at you right now
There ain't never been no doubt
Without you I'd be nothing
So if you ever worry about
Me walking out
Yeah, let me tell you something
I hold on
I hold on
Can you hear me, baby?
I hold on
Yeah
I hold on…

[Chorus]
To the things I believe in
My faith, your love, our freedom
To the things I can count on
To keep me going strong
Yeah, I hold on, I hold on
Like the stripes to the flag
Like a boy to his dad
I can't change who I am, right or wrong
So I hold on

[Verse 1]
Don't worry about the damage done
Just let those words roll off your tongue
Even if you're lying
If you really don't mean it, I don't care
If you need a little buzz to get you there
Then baby I'm buying

[Chorus]
Well couldn't you
Say you do
Say you might
For tonight
Have a heart
Bend the truth
Even if you don't
Couldn't you
Mess me up
Get in my head
Steal my t-shirt
Wreck my bed
All night long
Like you used to
Even if you don't
Couldn't you
Say you do?

[Verse 2]
Yeah baby, I'm begging you to lead me on
Say it feels good to be back in my arms
And then don't call me
I don't mind a little smoke getting in my eyes
Baby, take your hands, take your lies
And lay 'em on me

[Chorus]
Well couldn't you
Say you do
Say you might
For tonight
Have a heart
Bend the truth
Even if you don't
Couldn't you
Mess me up
Get in my head
Steal my t-shirt
Wreck my bed
All night long
Like you used to
Even if you don't
Couldn't you
Say you do?

[Verse 3]
Well don't worry about the damage done
Just let those words roll of your tongue
Even if you're lying

[Chorus]
Well couldn't you
Say you do
Say you might
For tonight
Have a heart
Bend the truth
Even if you don't
Couldn't you
Mess me up
Get in my head
Steal my t-shirt
Wreck my bed
All night long
Like you used to
Even if you don't
Couldn't you
Say you do?
Say you do
Just say you do

[Verse 1]
You can try to wrap your words
Like rocks around my ankles
And push me off a bridge
In hopes that I might drown
Any cheap shots that you got
Yeah, I can handle
You don't get this far without knowing
How to get up off the ground

[Chorus]
So I turn up a cold one
And I turn up the volume
On life, on love
On the way I feel right now
Yeah, I learned how to let go
And how to take the high road
I'm on another level
You can't bring me down
Na na na na na na
Na na na na na na
Na na na na na na

[Verse 2]
I'll be the first to say
I've made some bad decisions
I've been a little quick
To call the kettle black
But it's true what they say
About forgiveness
And once you find a man
There ain't nothing that can hold you back

[Chorus]
So, I turn up a cold one
And I turn up the volume
On life, on love
On the way I feel right now
Yeah, I learned how to let go
And how to take the high road
I'm on another level
You can't bring me down
Na na na na na na
Na na na na na na
Na na na na na na
Na na na na na na, yeah

[Bridge]
There ain't nothing like
The way my baby holds me
There ain't nothing like this
Sweet piece that I've found
It takes off all the shackles
So save yourself the battle
Yeah, ha, you can't bring me down

[Chorus]
I'm gonna turn up a cold one
And I turn up the volume
On life, on love
On the way I feel right now
Yeah, I learned how to let go
And how to take the high road
I'm on another level
You can't bring me down

[Chorus]
Yeah, I learned how to let go
And how to take the high road
I'm on another level
No, you can't bring me down
Na na na na na na
Na na na na na na, ha
Na na na na na na
Na na na na na na, yeah
Aw, turn it up

[Verse 1]
When I'm all alone or in a crowd
In a quiet place or where music's loud
If I'm on the road, or in the other room
That's how you know, I'm thinking of you
When the flowers bloom, when the leaves turn brown
When the sun is hot, when the snow falls down, down
When the clouds are gray, and the skies are blue
That's how you know, I'm thinking of you

[Chorus]
I'm thinking of you, that's all I do all the time
You're always the first and the last thing on this heart of mine
No matter where I go or what I do
I'm thinking of you

[Verse 2]
Can't remember names, who I used to be
What I cared about before you came to me, baby
Every selfish thought, all I thought I knew
Has been replaced with thinking of you

[Chorus]
I'm thinking of you, that's all I do all the time
You're always the first and the last thing on this heart of mine
No matter where I go or what I do
I'm thinking of you

[Chorus]
I'm thinking of you, that's all I do all the time
You're always the first and the last thing on this heart of mine
No matter where I go or what I do
I'm thinking of you
Always thinking of you, yes I am

[Verse 1]
Ever since I met you girl, you been on my brain
I can’t think of nothing else but you all night and day
It’s like I got a first class seat up on Ozzy’s train
It’s driving me insane

[Chorus]
5-1-5-0, somebody call the po-po
I’m going crazy, thinking ‘bout you baby
5-1-5-0, just this side of loco
I’m going crazy, think I love you baby

[Verse 2]
I gotta get your number girl, I gotta call you up
I gotta get you riding shotgun in my truck
This little bit of you I’ve got, it ain’t good enough
Yeah, you got me all messed up

[Chorus]
5-1-5-0, somebody call the po-po
I’m going crazy, thinking ‘bout you baby
5-1-5-0, just this side of loco
I’m going crazy, think I love you baby

[Verse 3]
Cause I, ain’t never felt like this, no
And I, I just need one kiss, from you
And I’ll be good as new
If I don’t get some of your sweet loving no telling what I might do

[Chorus]
5-1-5-0, somebody call the po-po uhm
I think I'm losing my mind girl
5-1-5-0, just this side of loco yeah yeah yeah yeah

[Outro]
5-1-5-0, somebody call the po-po
I’m going crazy, thinking ‘bout you baby
5-1-5-0, spinning my head like a yo-yo
I’m going crazy, think I love you baby

[Verse 1]
Woke up this mornin' with my cellphone ringin'
She said, "I know that when you called me, you were drinking
But I loved every single word you left on my phone
And I know you're hung-over but I'm comin' on over"
Did I say we'd go shoppin', That I'd Louis Vuitton her
That I'd Rodeo Drive her, Slide a Tiffany diamond on her

[Chorus]
What the hell did I say
When I called last night
Drippin' words of whiskey honey
In that message that she liked
What the hell did I say
Gotta dial it up again
Un-blackout those lines that fell out drunk at 3 am
What the hell did I, hell did I, hell did I say
What the hell did I, hell did I, hell did I say

[Verse 2]
Last thing I remember, I was thinking I'd call her up and
Put her on speaker while the whole bar sang Free Bird
Had that phone in my hand when I ran into trouble
My friend comin' over with a couple of doubles

[Chorus]
What the hell did I say
When I called last night
Drippin' words of whiskey honey
In that message that she liked
What the hell did I say
Gotta dial it up again
Un-blackout those lines that fell out drunk at 3 am
What the hell did I, hell did I, hell did I say
What the hell did I, hell did I, hell did I say

[Bridge]
Did I say we'd go shoppin', That I'd Louis Vuitton her
That I'd Rodeo Drive her, Slide a Tiffany diamond on her?
Did I tell her she could move in and we'd fly out to Vegas
Champagne all the way and we'd get married by Elvis

[Chorus]
What the hell did I say
When I called last night
Drippin' words of whiskey honey
In that message that she liked
What the hell did I say
Gotta dial it up again
Un-blackout those lines that fell out drunk at 3 am
What the hell did I, hell did I, hell did I say
What the hell did I, hell did I, hell did I say

[Outro]
What the hell did I say?
What the hell did I say?

[Verse 1]
Lay your pretty head down on my shoulder
You don’t have to worry anymore
This old world is cold and getting colder
And I know how to lock and bolt the door
I’m strong enough to hold you through the winter
Mean enough to stare your demons down
The hard times put the shine into the diamond
I won’t let that keep us in the ground

[Chorus]
I'm a riser
I'm a get off of the ground, don't run and hider
Pushing comes to shove
Hey, I'm a fighter
When darkness comes to town, I'm a lighter
A get out aliver of the fire
Survivor

[Verse 2]
If we ain't got no money, I can make it
And I ain't afraid of working to the bone
When I don’t know what I'm doing, I can fake it
I'll pray 'til jesus rolls away the stone

[Chorus]
I'm a riser
I'm a get off of the ground, don't run and hider
Pushing comes to shove
Hey, I'm a fighter
When darkness comes to town, I'm a lighter
A get out aliver of the fire
Survivor

[Bridge]
I'm a trier
I'm a get down low so I can lift you higher
An army couldn’t keep down my desire
Yeah

[Chorus]
I'm a riser
I'm a get off of the ground, don't run and hider
Pushing comes to shove
Hey, I'm a fighter
When darkness comes to town, I'm a lighter
A get out aliver of the fire
Survivor

[Outro]
I’m a riser
I’m a riser
I’m a riser
I’m a riser

[Verse 1]
West, on a plane bound west
I see her stretching out below
Land, blessed mother land
The place where I was born
Scars, yeah she’s got her scars
Sometimes it starts to worry me
Cause lose, I don’t wanna lose
Sight of who we are

[Pre-Chorus]
From the mountains high
To the wave crashed coast
There’s a way to find
Better days I know

[Chorus]
It’s been a long hard ride
Got a ways to go
But this is still the place
That we all call home

[Verse 2]
Free, nothing feels like free
Though it sometimes means we don’t get along
Cause same, no we're not the same
But that’s what makes us strong

[Pre-Chorus]
From the mountains high
To the wave crashed coast
There’s a way to find
Better days I know

[Chorus]
It’s been a long hard ride
Got a ways to go
But this is still the place
That we all call home

[Verse 3]
Brave, gotta call it brave
To chase that dream across the sea
Names, and they signed their names
For something they believed
Red, how the blood ran red
And we laid our dead in sacred ground
Just think, wonder what they think
If they could see us now

[Chorus]
It’s been a long hard ride
Got a ways to go
But this is still the place
That we all call home

[Outro]
It’s been a long hard ride
And I won’t lose hope
This is still the place
That we all call home

[Verse 1]
You know we didn't get it right
But it wasn't all wrong
It wasn't just a phase
And it isn't all gone
Before we go and let the lonely
Do what it does
I want one more memory of us

[Chorus]
With nothing on but the stars
Through the window pane
Burn your silver silhouette into my brain
I can't have you forever
But I'll take tonight
I wanna remember you right now just like you are
With nothing on but the stars
Yeah

[Verse 2]
You can take your things
And I'll take my mine
Before you go and leave it all behind
I wanna drink you all up
And soak you all in
And watch those constellations crawl across your skin

[Chorus]
Nothing on but the stars
Through the window pane
Burn your silver silhouette into my brain
I can't have you forever
But I'll take tonight
I wanna remember you right now just like you are
With nothing on but the stars
My hands on your hips in the dark
Nothing on but the stars

[Bridge]
'Cause I ain't ready to let you let me go
Just give me one more night to hold you close

[Chorus]
With nothing on but the stars
I can't have you forever
But I'll take tonight
I wanna remember you right now just like you are
With nothing on but the stars
My hands on your hips in the dark
Nothing on but the stars

[Outro]
Before we go and let the lonely
Do what it does
I want one more memory of us

[Verse 1]
Levi jacket broken in just right
I left it on the bleachers that Friday night
Felt so cool in the stone-washed fade
There's just some things that can't be replaced
That runaround freedom summer '89
Spinnin' that bottle on a lot of first times
It was all summed up on a Memorex mixtape
There's just some things that can't be replaced

[Chorus]
Woah, it don't matter how hard you try
Woah, all the money in the world won't ever buy
What you miss, what you want back
It'd be nice, but life don't work like that
You can get damn close, but it won't ever be the same
There's just some things that can't be replaced
There's just some things that can't be replaced

[Verse 2]
Cinnamon hair and a heart of gold
Chevy Cavalier on an old backroad
A Boone’s Farm kiss that I still taste
There's just some things that can't be replaced

[Chorus]
Woah, no matter how hard you try
Woah, all the money in the world won't ever buy
What you miss, what you want back
It'd be nice, but life don't work like that
You can get damn close, but it won't ever be the same
There's just some things that can't be replaced
There's just some things that can't be replaced
Woah

[Bridge]
For fifteen years right by my side
From a single man to three kids and a wife
Friends come and go, but when it comes to Jake
There's just some things that can't be replaced

[Chorus]
Woah, no matter how hard you try
Woah, all the money in the world won't ever buy
What you miss, what you want back
It'd be nice, but life don't work like that
You can get damn close, but it won't ever be the same
There's just some things that can't be replaced
There's just some things that can't be replaced

[Outro]
Woah (woah)

[Refrain]
Found some old forgotten photographs, yeah
Looking at them kinda made me laugh, at the
Big hair and the, drunk smile
I ain't seen him in quite a while

[Verse 1]
I been lucky to live two lives but I
Wouldn't want to live that one twice
Yeah the past is best left on the shelf

[Chorus]
I was a stranger to myself
Before you came along
Who I was back then is like an old forgotten song
You showed me who I am
You handed me the keys
And I unlocked the door to the better part of me
Without your love
I'd still be
Someone else
A stranger to myself

[Verse 2]
Just sitting on the porch with you
Knowing now what I never knew, like
How much more the laughter is, when you
Have someone, to share it with
You stretched this heart of mine
A million miles wide
You wouldn't even recognize the old me

[Chorus]
I was a stranger to myself
Before you came along
Who I was back then is like an old forgotten song
You showed me who I am
You handed me the keys
And I unlocked the door to the better part of me
Without your love
I'd still be
Someone else
A stranger to myself

[Bridge]
Without your love, without your kiss
Showed me what life really is
I never wanna go back there again
To when

[Chorus]
I was a stranger to myself
Before you came along
Who I was back then is like an old forgotten song
You showed me who I am
You handed me the keys
And I unlocked the door to the better part of me
Without your love
I'd still be
Someone else
A stranger to myself

[Refrain]
Found some old forgotten photographs, yeah
Looking at them kinda made me laugh, at the
Big hair and the, drunk smile
I ain't seen him in quite a while

[Verse 1]
I dialed seven digits five times today
Just to hear you say you love or hate me
I'll take anything
I just wanna hear your voice
Cut through the line like a heart-shaped knife
Cut me down baby, one more time
Good or bad baby
Yes, no, maybe
It's driving me crazy

[Chorus]
Won't you pick up the phone?
I can pick up some wine
I can pick you up in my pickup truck
And we can pick up right where we left off
Ain't that what we both want?
Pick up the pieces girl
It ain't that broke
Pick up the past and just let it go
Put down that over me-never wanna see me again-goodbye kinda stuff and pick up

[Verse 2]
You're putting me through hell one ring voicemail
Baby I can tell that you ain't on the other line
Accept or decline
How can I tell you if you won't listen?
How can I tell you what I've been missin'?
If you don't, don't, don't
If you won't, won't, won't

[Chorus]
Won't you pick up the phone?
I can pick up some wine
I can pick you up in my pickup truck
And we can pick up right where we left off
Ain't that what we both want?
Pick up the pieces girl
It ain't that broke
Pick up the past and just let it go
Put down that over me-never wanna see me again-goodbye kinda stuff and pick up

[Bridge]
Oh, pick up
Put down the mistakes we made
And the words we didn't mean to say

[Chorus]
And pick up the phone
I can pick up some wine
I can pick you up in my pickup truck
And we can pick up right where we left off
Ain't that what we both want?
Pick up the pieces girl
It ain't that broke
Pick up the past and just let it go
Put down that over me-never wanna see me again-goodbye kinda stuff and pick up
Baby pick up

[Outro]
I dialed seven digits five times today
Just to hear you say you love or hate me (love or hate me)
I just wanna hear your voice

[Verse 1]
I fell in love on the L train
Headed somewhere north of where you are
Thought I knew where I was going
Now I know I'm going where you are

[Chorus]
Ain't gonna lie I've been drinking
That Colorado's got me stoned
And every time I close my eyes the angels are singing
Loving you ain't my decision
Loving you is my religion

[Verse 2]
I wanna hear what's been hurting
I carve that on a bench in Central Park
And when I showed up there the next day
You'd written your initials in a heart

[Chorus]
Ain't gonna lie I've been drinking
That Colorado's got me stoned
And every time I close my eyes the angels are singing
Loving you ain't my decision
Loving you is my religion

[Verse 3]
I'm in love out in LA
Paris, Tokyo, coast to coast
And it's you that keeps me going
Love from you will always mean the most

[Chorus]
Ain't gonna lie I've been drinking
That Colorado's got me stoned
And every time I close my eyes the angels are singing
Loving you ain't my decision
Loving you is my religion

[Verse 1]
How much reassurance does a man need
Why can't I just let a good thing be
Is it just me? Something don't seem right
In my whole life I've never been so close
To anyone, anything, so girl, I know
I gotta let go and give up the fight
You keep talking like everything's gonna be alright

[Chorus]
So why do I feel like you're slipping away?
So dark in my heart girl
Too many times torn apart girl
I wanna believe what you're trying to say
Girl I'm trying to listen
Don't want my suspicions to drive you away
Why do I, why do I keep messing with a good thing?
Why do I feel?

[Verse 2]
Trying to understand, explain everything
Over analyze us like we're some game
Trying to find pain, where there's only love
It's maybe just that I've never been this far
Never walked through so many open doors
And when I get more, it's never enough
You and me babe
I know we're right as rain

[Chorus]
So why do I feel like you're slipping away?
So dark in my heart girl
Too many times torn apart girl
I wanna believe what you're trying to say
Girl I'm trying to listen
Don't want my suspicions to drive you away
Why do I, why do I keep messing with a good thing?

[Bridge]
Why do I feel like that when it feels like this?
Better than the best it's ever been
Lost in your body here in the dark
Your fingers, my skin: a match and a spark
I told myself I'd make a brand new start

[Chorus]
I wanna believe what you're trying to say
Girl I'm trying to listen
Don't want my suspicions to drive you away
Yeah, I'm trying to listen
Don't want my suspicions to drive you away
Why do I, why do I keep messing with a good thing?
Why do I feel?
Why do I feel?

[Verse 1]
I wake up every morning lonesome out of my mind
Reach across my bed what do I find
Sometimes a pillow sometimes a warm body
But they both leave me cold and feeling so empty

[Chorus]
I need to find the right one right away
I can't keep goin' on livin' this way
Each night I go out I'm just diggin' deeper in my grave
I wonder if I'm ever gonna find
The one that'll bring me piece of mind
The one on who I can set my heart free
This livin' single is gonna be the death of me

[Verse 3]
When the sun is high that's when I reach my low
And I vow to change my life and the places I go
But the sun starts sinkin and so do my big plans
And it ain't too long before a cold one's in my hand

[Chorus]
I need to find the right one right away
I can't keep goin' on livin' this way
Each night I go out I'm just diggin' deeper in my grave
I wonder if I'm ever gonna find
The one that'll bring me piece of mind
The one on who I can set my heart free
This livin' single is gonna be the death of me

[Bridge]
Now if I die before I find her
Play her this song as a reminder
Of what might have been if we had met
Before I met this timely death

[Chorus]
I need to find the right one right away
I can't keep goin' on livin' this way
Each night I go out I'm just diggin' deeper in my grave
I wonder if I'm ever gonna find
The one that'll bring me piece of mind
The one on who I can set my heart free
This livin' single is gonna be the death of me

[Outro]
I couldn't find the right one right away
I couldn't keep goin on livin this way
Each night I went out I was just diggin deeper in my grave
I wondered if I was ever gonna find
The one that'd bring me piece of mind
The one on who I could set my heart free
This livin single it's been the death of me
This livin single it's been the death of me

[Chorus]
Come a little closer, baby
I feel like laying you down

[Verse 1]
On a bed sweet surrender
Where we can work it all out
There ain't nothing that love can't fix
Girl, it's right here at our fingertips

[Chorus]
Come a little closer, baby
I feel like laying you down

[Verse 2]
Come a little closer, baby
I feel like letting go
Of everything that stands between us
And the love we used to know
I wanna touch you like a cleansing rain
Let it wash all the hurt away

[Chorus]
Come a little closer, baby
I feel like laying you down

[Verse 3]
If there's still a chance
Then take my hand
And we'll steal away
Off into the night
'till we make things right
The suns gonna rise on a better day

Come a little closer baby
I feel like stripping it down
Back to the basics of you and me
And what makes the world go round
Every inch of you against my skin
I wanna be stronger than we've ever been

[Chorus]
Come a little closer, baby
I feel like laying you down

[Outro]
Come a little bit closer baby
Just a little bit closer baby
Come a little bit closer baby
I feel like laying you down

[Verse 1]
I learned how to write it when I first started school
Some bully didn't like it, he said it didn't sound to cool
So I had to hit him and all I said when the blood came
It's my last name

[Verse 2]
Grandpa took of to Europe to fight the Germans in the war
It came back on some dog tags nobody wears no more
It's written on a headstone in the field where he was slain
It's my last name

[Chorus]
Passed down from generations too far back to trace
I can see all my relations when I look into my face
May never make it famous but I'll never bring it shame
It's my last name

{Verse 3}
Daddy always told me far back as I recall
Son, your part of something, you represent us all
So keep it how you got it , as solid as it came
It's my last name

[Chorus]

[Verse 4]
So darling if you're wondering why I've got you here tonight
I want to be your husband, I want you to be my wife
I ain't got much to give you but what I've got means everything
It's my last name, oh, it's my last name

[Outro]
I learned how to write it when I first started school

[Verse 1]
Baby, you ain't gotta wait forever
Before you go and break my heart
If you're thinking that we shouldn't be together
Just leave me in the dark a little longer

[Pre-Chorus]
Do it on the highway, do it on the drive way
Chevrolet backing out
But not here in this cafe booth with you
Don't ruin this perfect town

[Chorus]
Say it's over over on the west coast somewhere
In the middle of the city, new years eve time square
If you gotta let me go I'm gonna be alright
Just don't tell me goodbye here in Telluride
No, don't take me down low when we're up this high
Don't you tell me goodbye here in Telluride

[Verse 2]
Ever since we touched down in Colorado
I could tell something wasn't right
'Cause you look at those snow capped mountain
You won't look into my eyes

[Pre-Chorus]
Do it in a text, better yet in a letter
You can leave my pillow case
You can wreck me back in Tennessee
Anywhere but this place

[Chorus]
Say it's over over on the west coast somewhere
In the middle of the city, new years eve time square
If you gotta let me go I'm gonna be alright
Just don't tell me goodbye here in Telluride
No, don't take me down low when we're up this high
Don't you tell me goodbye here in Telluride

[Interlude]

[Pre-Chorus]
Do it on the highway, do it on the drive way
Chevrolet backing out
But not here in this cafe booth with you
Don't ruin this perfect town

Don't say it's over underneath this sky so blue
Don't say it's over, have a little mercy girl, won't you?

[Chorus]
Say it's over from your window seat on our flight home
Maybe once we get back do it over the phone
If you gotta let me go I'm gonna be alright
Just don't tell me goodbye here in Telluride
No, don't take me down low when we're up this high
Don't you tell me goodbye in Telluride
Don't you tell me goodbye in Telluride

[Verse 1]
Hey, brother, there’s an endless road to re-discover
Hey, sister, know the water's sweet but blood is thicker
Oh, if the sky comes falling down, on you
There’s nothing in this world i wouldn't do

[Chorus]
Hey, brother, there’s an endless road to re-discover
Hey, sister, do you still believe in love i wonder?
Oh, if the sky comes falling down, on you
There’s nothing in this world i wouldn't do

[Verse 2]
What if i'm far from home?
Oh, brother, i will hear you call
What if i lose it all?
Oh, sister, i will help you out!
Oh, if the sky comes falling down, on you
There’s nothing in this world i wouldn't do

[Chorus]

[Outro]
What if i'm far from home?
Oh, brother, i will hear you call
What if i lose it all?
Oh, sister, i will help you out!
Oh, if the the sky comes falling down, on you
There’s nothing in this world i wouldn’t do

[Verse 1]
Pair of boots and a sack of clothes
Free and easy down the road I go
Hanging memories on the high line poles
Free and easy down the road I go
Free and easy down the road I go

[Verse 2]
Ragweed's rocking on the radio
Free and easy down the road I go
So I keep rolling like an old banjo
Free and easy down the road I go

[Bridge 1]
Got the sun shining on me like a big spotlight
So I know everything is gonna be alright

[Chorus]
Ain't no telling where the wind might blow
Free and easy down the road I go
Living life like a Sunday stroll
Free and easy down the road I go
Free and easy down the road I go

[Bridge 2]
If you only get to go around one time
I'm gonna sit back and try to enjoy the ride

[Verse 3]
I could make a million or wind up broke
Free and easy down the road I go
Can't take it with you when you go so

[Chorus]
Free and easy down the road I go
Someday I know it's going to take me home so
Free and easy down the road I go
Free and easy down the road I go

[Verse 1]
You can't make a wish, on a star, when they're all burnt out
You can't find that hope, swallowed up, in the deepest dark

[Pre-Chorus 1]
The light at the end of the tunnel's a train
You're tied to the tracks with the heaviest chains

[Chorus]
Let's chase away, the storms and the rain
And the days of dark (oh-oh-ohh)
Your hand in mine, there's no better time
Or a place to start (oh-oh-ohh)
Let's raise a glass, to the pain of the past
And never look back on these broken hearts
Bright red horizon, the sun started shining
So open your eyes, and let's say goodbye
To the days of dark! (oh-oh-ohh, oh-ohhh)

[Verse 2]
It's good to feel you kiss, a smile, back on my face
It's good to feel that rush, of blood, back in my veins

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Let's dance through the fire, break out of this cage
Let's turn off the music, and let's turn the page

[Chorus]
Let's chase away, the storms and the rain
And the days of dark (oh-oh-ohh)
Your hand in mine, there's no better time
Or a place to start (oh-oh-ohh)
Let's raise a glass, to the pain of the past
And never look back on these broken hearts
Bright red horizon, the sun started shining
So open your eyes, and let's say goodbye
To the days of dark! (oh-oh-ohh, oh-ohhh)

[Bridge]
Still in the weeds, not out of the woods
But something in my heart
Tells me that this is the start
Of something good (1,2,3,4...)

[Chorus]
Let's chase away, the storms and the rain
And the days of dark (oh-oh-ohh)
Your hand in mine, there's no better time
Or a place to start (oh-oh-ohh)
Let's raise a glass, to the pain of the past
And never look back on these broken hearts
Bright red horizon, the sun started shining
So open your eyes, and let's say goodbye
To the days of dark! (oh-oh-ohh, oh-ohhh)
The days of dark! (oh-oh-ohh, oh-ohhh)
Hey!

[Instrumental]

[Verse 1: Dierks Bentley]
I used to carry my past like a duffel bag
It's been hurting my head and breaking my back
But when you live in the rear view you just crash
Oh, I'm done carrying my past like that

[Chorus: Both]
I'm travelling light
I'm laying it down
All those demons I keep dragging round
I'm cutting the ties
I'm dropping the weight
With all my hurt and my regrets and my mistakes
I'm tired of living unforgiven
So i'm travelling light
Oh, I'm travelling light

[Verse 2: Brandi Carlile]
Don't lay the blame on anyone else
I'm always last to forgive myself
Well starting over is overdue
And these old boots sure feel brand new

[Chorus: Both]
I'm travelling light
I'm laying it down
All those demons I keep dragging round
I'm cutting the ties
I'm dropping the weight
With all my hurt and my regrets and my mistakes
I'm tired of living unforgiven
So I'm travelling light
Oh, I'm travelling light

[Bridge: Both]
All I'm gonna take it a little bit of faith
And it's all gonna be alright
I only got room for some love and some truth
And a little bit of peace of mind

[Chorus: Both]
So I'm travelling light
And I'm laying it down
All those demons, I left 'em buried in the ground
I'm cutting the ties
I'm dropping the weight
I got a one way ticket towards them better days
I'm tired of living unforgiven
So I'm travelling light
Oh, I'm travelling light
I'm travelling light

[Verse 1]
I must look just like a fool here
In the middle of the road
Standing there in your rear view
And getting soaked to the bone
This land is flat as it is mean
A man can see for a hundred miles
So I'm still praying I might see
The glow of a brake light

[Chorus 1]
But your wheels just turn
Down the road ahead
If it hurts at all
You ain't showed it yet
I keep a looking for
The slightest sign that you might miss
What you left behind
I know there's nothing stopping you now
But I'd settle for a slowdown

[Verse 2]
I held on longer than I should
Believing you might change your mind
And those bright lights of Hollywood
Would fade in time

[Chorus 1]

But your wheels just turn
Down the road ahead
If it hurts at all
You ain't showed it yet
You're just a tiny dot on that horizon line
Come on tap those brakes
Baby just one time
I know there's nothing stopping you now
I'm not asking you to turn back around

[Outro]
I'd settle for a slowdown
Come on just slow down
I'd settle for a slow down

[Verse 1]
Well she could be like a song
The kind that with time always comes back on
Something tells me she's gone
There's no chords, there's no rhymes
There's no singing along

[Pre-Chorus]
I pushed her a little too far for a little too long
It's a little too late to keep her from

[Chorus]
Highways and byways that'll take her anywhere but my way
There's so many ways she could say goodbye
Railways and runways
From the way she was looking, I'm afraid that
Whatever the way, it's gonna be one way this time

[Verse 2]
Well she was like my guitar
Always waiting around just to be in my arms
But you can't play with a heart
Shouldn't ever have left her alone in the dark

[Pre-Chorus]
I couldn't see it back then
Ah but look at her now
You can't pick it back up once it's headed down

[Chorus]
Highways and byways that'll take her anywhere but my way
There's so many ways she could say goodbye
Railways and runways
From the way she was looking, I'm afraid that
Whatever the way, it's gonna be one way this time

[Pre-Chorus]
I pushed her a little too far for a little too long
Gave her little choice but to get on

[Chorus]
Highways and byways that'll take her anywhere but my way
There's so many ways she could say goodbye
Railways and runways
From the way she was looking, I'm afraid that
Whatever the way, it's gonna be one way this time
Whatever the way, it's gonna be one way this time

[Verse 1]
Something 'bout George Jones on the headphones
Truth through a microphone
Livin' on and on and on in a melody
Something 'bout starlight on Kansas
The way a wheat field dances
Fence posts as far as the eye can see

[Pre-Chorus]
It just gets all the way to me
It just gets all the way to me

[Verse 2]
Something 'bout the sound of crack in bottle tops
Makes troubles fade and time stop
Holdin' that cold somehow sets you free
Or thinking back to who I was
Saving up for that used truck
Her Levi's laying on my Chevy seats

[Pre-Chorus]
It just gets all the way to me
It just gets all the way to me

[Chorus]
It ain't like smoke gets in your clothes
Naw, it cuts through my skin and digs in way down deep
Soaks in like rain
Burns like a flame
Takes ahold of my soul underneath
It just gets all the way to me
It just gets all the way to me

[Verse 3]
Something 'bout a drawer full of yesterdays
A hand-me-down knife and a last name
And a shoebox full of roots from the family tree
Something 'bout me and her
And how our love turned into brown eyes looking up
The sound of hardwood floors on little feet

[Pre-Chorus]
It just gets all the way to me

[Chorus]
It ain't like smoke gets in your clothes
Naw, it cuts through my skin and digs in way down deep
Soaks in like rain
Burns like a flame
Takes ahold of my soul underneath
Just gets all the way to me
Just gets all the way to me, hey

[Bridge]
Something 'bout a wooden cross
Forgiving sins and no love lost
Gratitude I find on bended knee

[Outro]
It just gets all the way to me
It just gets all the way to me
It just gets all the way to me
It just gets all the way to me
It just gets all the way to me
It just gets all the way to me
It just gets all the way to me
It just gets all the way to me, all the way to me

[Verse 1]
It's the keys to your daddy's car
It's a night alone underneath the desert stars
It's a five o'clock whistle
It's the classroom bell
It's a Panama City at the window yell
A first kiss after a broken heart

[Chorus]
We all wanna break the chains
Feel the wind against our face
Everybody wants the same thing
We wanna taste that freedom (freedom)
Everybody 'round here wanna taste that freedom (freedom)
Freedom

[Verse 2]
It's a pocket full of folded cash
It's telling that boss he can kiss your ass
That ticket to your favorite show
Getting lost in the rock n roll
Close your eyes, hands up high
Go on and let it all go-oh

[Chorus]
We all wanna break the chains
Feel the wind against our face
Everybody wants the same thing
We wanna taste that freedom (freedom)
Everybody 'round here wanna taste that freedom (freedom)
Freedom

[Bridge]
Freedom
Everybody 'round here wanna taste that freedom (freedom, freedom)
That flag on a solider's sleeve
All around the world they know what it means
And they all just wanna little piece of freedom, yeah
That flag on a solider's sleeve
All around the world they know what it means
And they all want just a little piece of this freedom, yeah

[Chorus]
We all wanna break the chains
Feel the wind against our face
Everybody wants the same thing
We wanna taste that freedom (freedom)
Everybody 'round here wanna taste that freedom (freedom)
Freedom

[Outro]
(Freedom)
(Everybody 'round here wanna taste that freedom, freedom)

[Verse 1]
Damn she hurts the morning after
Drunk on thinking I could have her
Strung her out long like lights on a balcony
Come Wednesday, she don't care
Tuesday night I had her here
Like beads and feathers, it was heaven her hanging on me

[Chorus]
She took me for a ride, hit a new high
Throwing confetti in her green eyes
Trying like hell to hold the bell of a ball
She pulled me in a world of wonder
It's a charade trying to love her
It's like trying to save a soul from Mardi Gras
From Mardi Gras

[Verse 2]
Trashed my heart just like these streets
Her perfume's all over me
Just reminded me of a night I can't forget
She paraded me around
Swirled eyes, not I had a crown on my head till she left
Thought she'd stay, but instead

[Chorus]
She took me for a ride, hit a new high
Throwing confetti in her green eyes
Trying like hell to hold the bell of a ball
She pulled me in a world of wonder
It's a charade trying to love her
It's like trying to save a soul from Mardi Gras
From Mardi Gras
From Mardi Gras

[Bridge]
She ain't looking for love
No she's just looking for a real good time
And you can't change her weather
She's a hurricane every time

[Chorus]
She took me for a ride, hit a new high
Throwing confetti in her green eyes
Trying like hell to hold the bell of a ball
She pulled me in a world of wonder
It's a charade trying to love her
It's like trying to save a soul from Mardi Gras
From Mardi Gras

[Outro]
From Mardi Gras
From Mardi Gras
(Mardi Gras)

[Intro]
(One, two)

[Verse 1]
There's a cactus fly where somewhere out there
Knows my deepest thoughts
There's a tumbleweed inside of me that's never gonna stop
There's a mountain out there somewhere I still haven't climbed
You know I love you, baby, I just need a little time

[Chorus]
'Cause I'm a son of the sun, a brother to the sky
Sometimes I gotta lose myself so I don't lose my mind
I get some dust on my boots
Found some truth in the blue
Let the desert air burn inside my lungs
'Cause baby I'm a son of the sun

[Verse 2]
I wanna look down on a valley
Where the river splits the stone
Let the great wide open
Open wide my soul
I could never live without you
I always come back to you
But sometimes I need to catch the wind
And go howl at the moon

[Chorus]
'Cause I'm a son of the sun, a brother to the sky
Sometimes I gotta lose myself so I don't lose my mind
I get some dust on my boots
Found some truth in the blue
Let the desert air burn inside my lungs
'Cause baby I'm a son of the sun
I'm a son of the sun, a brother to the sky
Sometimes I gotta lose myself so I don't lose my mind
I get some dust on my boots
Found some truth in the blue
Let the desert air burn inside my lungs
'Cause baby I'm a son of the sun
A son of the sun
A son of the sun

[Verse 1]
Well it was friday in the p.m
And just like every weekend
I was ready to throw down
Yeah get a little tore up
So I call my bros up to meet me out on the town
Well wild man willy said I like to really
But idol's on tv
And ray had a date
With his wife and Nate quit drinking
But he didn't tell me

[Chorus]
Am I the only one who wants to have fun tonight?
Is there anybody out there who wants to have a cold beer
Kick it to the morning light?
If I have to raise hell all by myself
I will but y'all, that ain't right
It's time to get it on
Am I the only one who wants to have fun tonight?

[Verse 2]
Well I was flying solo down at Silverado's
The joint looking like a morgue
When this country cutie with a rock and roll booty
Came strutting in through the door
Yelled who wants to dance and fired up the band with with a franklin and a shot of patron
She looked right at me and said
"What's it gonna be
Are you gonna let me to party alone?"

[Chorus]
Am I the only one who wants to have fun tonight?
Is there anybody out there who wants to have a cold beer
Kick it to the morning light?
If I have to raise hell all by myself
I will but y'all, that ain't right
It's time to get it on
Am I the only one who wants to have fun tonight?

[Chorus]
Am I the only one who wants to have fun tonight?
Is there anybody out there who wants to have a cold beer
Kick it to the morning light?
If I have to raise hell all by myself
I will but y'all, that ain't right
It's time to get it on
Am I the only one who wants to have fun tonight?

[Outro]
Come on come on
Get your good time on
Let's have a little fun tonight
Let's have a little fun tonight
Let's have a little fun tonight
Let's have a little fun tonight

Whoa

I hear the voices in my head
My middle finger's 'bout to pledge
Oh, can't you see that blue and red?
Some things are better left unsaid, yeah

[Post-Chorus]
I put two gunshots in the air
The people scattered everywhere
But I don't really give a care, nope
Some things in life are just unfair
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse 1]
I walk upright like a soldier
Yeah, I'm hot like Arizona
Mix the bacon and the soda
I ain't mixin' bakin' soda
Mm, yay, yay, yay, yay
Ain't scared of no rain
I walk upright like a soldier
Yeah, I'm cold as North Dakota
Mix the bacon and the soda
I ain't mixin' bakin' soda
Mm, yay, mm, yay
Ain't scared of no pain

[Chorus]
I hear the voices in my head
My middle finger's 'bout to pledge
Oh, can't you see that blue and red?
Some things are better left unsaid, yeah

If you're on one, on one
You just gotta hold on, hold on
We all need someone to lean on, yeah
But you gotta be strong, yeah
If you're on one, on one
You just needa hold on, hold on
We all need someone to lean on, yeah
But we gotta be strong, yeah

[Chorus]
I put the gun up to my head (Head)
But I was already dead (Dead)
Sometimes you have to kill the flesh (Flesh)
To get some things up off your chest (Chest)
I heard the voices in my head
I'm screamin' fuck the blue and red
Now it's startin' to all make sense
Some things are better left unsaid

[Verse 3]
Son of a gun stealin' all the fun
In a barn full of corn where the steel mill turn
Limousine full of smoke with the windows down
Every day's a new day, get your moonshine on
Hillbilly's got to rockin' and the rockin' turned to dancin'
At a bonfire full of all paraphernalia, yuh, huh
Damn right, uh-huh
Son of a gun stealin' all the fun
In a barn full of corn where the steel mill turn
Limousine full of smoke with the windows down
Every day's a new day, get your moonshine on

At a bonfire full of all paraphernalia, yuh, huh
Damn right

Sometime life teach you a lesson
That makes you cold (Cold!)

[Refrain]
Hell, I gave her everything, even down to my last sin
And she just took my heart and ran away with it
She gave me life (Life!)
And told me everything would be perfect
But it ain't right (Right!)
Don't even know if it was worth it

[Chorus]
You gotta strap up your boots, get your feelings aligned
Yeah, I'll be alright, yeah, I'll be alright
Gotta get in your mood, thank God I'm alive

Everything that live gon' grow
Gotta get it while we're on the go
Bless the hearts that try to take my soul

[Verse 2]
Now, I can't wait (What?)
I gotta make a move (Move!)
Sometimes you find yourself in places
That makes you cross

[Refrain]
Hell, I gave her everything, even down to my last sin, yeah
She paired up with Satan and they became the best of friends
She fed me life
And told me everything would be perfect
But it ain't right
Don't even know if it was worth it

[Verse 3]
Eeny, meeny, meeny, meeny, miny, moe
Said you jumped on a plane, but you jumped the broom
Well, you left your feelings with the honeymoon
Yeah, you left your feelings with the honeymoon
Eeny, meeny, meeny, meeny, miny, moe
Said you dropped your feelings when you left her cold
She was playin' with your heart, tryna get your gold
Playin' with your heart, tryna get your gold

Bless the hearts that try to take my soul

[Bridge]
Sometimes you find yourself alone, and
You need someone by your side, but
They're just not the right one
So you gotta move on, and live life

[Chorus]
You gotta strap up your boots, get your feelings aligned
Yeah, I'll be alright, yeah, I'll be alright
Gotta get in your mood, thank God I'm alive
Yeah, I'll be alright, yeah, I'll be alright

[Outro]
Woo, woo
Woo, woo
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse 1]
Rainy nights, candles burning
I'm tossing, turning, my heart is hurting
Waking up bright and early
I grab my things, I'm gon' be late
So I jumped in my four-by-four
Then I left mud trails on the road
'Cause I gotta get home

[Chorus]
I'm in my mood
Tell me, what can I say? You’re a glass of champagne
And I’m just Tennessee whiskey
Mood
Tell me, what am I to do when it's all about you?
But I’m on this Tennessee whiskey
Yay, yay, yay-yay
Yay-yay-yay-yay
Yay-yay-yay
Girl, I'm on this Tennessee whiskey

[Verse 2]
I can't remember the last time
We had a one-on-one under the moonlight
My heart can't take no more of the little bitty lies
Deep down I had to swallow my pride
So I jumped back in my four-by-four
Then I left burnt rubber on the road, yeah

[Chorus]
I'm in my mood
Tell me, what can I say? You're a glass of champagne
And I'm just Tennessee whiskey
Mood
Tell me, what can I do? It was all about you
But I'm on this Tennessee whiskey
Mood
Tell me how can I change? You're a glass champagne
But I'm just Tennessee whiskey
Tennessee whiskey, Tennessee whiskey
Tennessee whiskey
Yay, yay, yay-yay
Yay-yay-yay-yay
Yay-yay-yay
Tennessee whiskey

[Verse 1]
Remember sittin' on the front porch (Front porch)
Gunshots at the backdoor (Backdoor)
I hear the wind and the skies a-cryin' (Cryin')
Honeysuckles on the trees are dyin' (Dyin')
Rockin' chairs with my nana (Nana)
Though, I never knew my grandpa (I missed him, grandpa)
Catchin' lightning bugs at night (At night)
But I was never satisfied ('Fied)

[Pre-Chorus]
I couldn't wait 'til the sun would set (Sun would set)
So we could do it over again (Over again)
And when the morning came
I heard the sirens ringin' from my bed (From my bed)

[Chorus]
It was all in my head (Head)
All in my head (Head)
Yeah (Yeah)
Those good ol' memo– good old memories
It was all in my head
Ghetto ol' memories

[Verse 2]
Freeze cups in the summer (Summer)
No drinkin' after nine o'clock
Sugar straws with the Big League bubble gum
Then we mixed it with some Pop Rocks (Pop Rocks)
Baseball in the front yard (Front yard)
In-a-hawk was my favorite sport
Who remember "Get outside"? (Get outside)
'Cause the TV screen was only reserve for the grown folks

[Pre-Chorus]
I couldn't wait 'til the sun would set
So we can do it over again
Oh, when the morning came
I heard those sirens ringin' from my bed

[Chorus]
It was all in my head
All in my head
Yeah (Yeah)
Those good ol' memo– good old memories
It was all in my head
Ghetto ol' memories

[Verse 1]
I ain't heard you laugh like that in a long time
I wonder if you stopped his world like you did mine just now
I see you sippin' white wine instead of whiskey
And does he want you to be just a little more city?
Well, I'm sorry if I'm overstepping boundaries
I don't mean to be, but I've just got to tell you how I feel

[Chorus]
If he ever singles you up, if he's ever stupid enough
I'ma be the first one calling you baby (Baby)
If he ain't holding you tight, if he ain't treating you right
I'ma be the first one calling him crazy (Crazy)
'Cause girl, it's just a matter of time until you find
That the right guy's staring you back into your eyes, right now
No rush, but if he ever singles you up

[Verse 2]
He hasn't even looked your way since you walked in (Walked in)
But I can't help it that I can't take my eyes off of you
Your favorite song just came on and me and you were singing along (Singing along)
And he don't even know a single word

[Chorus]
If he ever singles you up, if he's ever stupid enough
I'ma be the first one calling you baby (Baby)
If he ain't holding you tight, if he ain't treating you right
I'ma be the first one calling him crazy (Crazy)
'Cause girl, it's just a matter of time until you find
That the right guy's staring you back into your eyes, right now
No rush, but if he ever singles you up
If he ever singles you up
I'ma be the first to call baby

[Bridge]
Sorry if I'm overstepping boundaries
I don't mean to be, but I've just got to tell you how I feel

[Chorus]
If he ever singles you up, if he's ever stupid enough
I'ma be the first one calling you baby (Baby)
If he ain't holding you tight, if he ain't treating you right
I'ma be the first one calling him crazy (Crazy)
'Cause girl, it's just a matter of time until you find
That the right guy's staring you back into your eyes, right now
No rush, but if he ever singles you up
Oh, if he ever singles you up
If he ever singles you up

[Verse 1]
I think me and you should blow this off
So much for the after-party
Let's tell everybody we got lost
I think me and you should do our own thing
Our own way
At my place, far away

[Chorus]
Take it from me if you want a t-shirt to sleep in
It's my favorite but you can keep it
Looks good baby, you should leave it
Hanging off your shoulder
Now give me them bare feet dancing down the hallway
Smiling at me, running your finger down the wall
You know what I want, I got what you need
Take it from me

[Verse 2]
Baby, you should stop right now, right here
Right where we wanna be
I'll spin you around and let's just see
Where this thing goes
All I know is that I'm all yours, all night
I've got nothing but time

[Chorus]
So take it from me if you want a t-shirt to sleep in
It's my favorite but you can keep it
Looks good baby, you should leave it
Hanging off your shoulder
Now give me them bare feet dancing down the hallway
Smiling at me, running your finger down the wall
You know what I want, I got what you need
Take it from me
Take it from me, yeah

[Bridge]
But you can steal a kiss, I won't call you a thief
But take it from me
What I got to give you can have for free
Just take it from me

[Chorus]
Take it from me if you want a t-shirt to sleep in
It's my favorite but you can keep it
Looks good baby, you should leave it
Hanging off your shoulder
Now give me them bare feet dancing down the hallway
Smiling at me, running your finger down the wall
You know what I want, I got what you need
Take it from me
Just take it from me

[Outro]
Take my word, take my heart
Take my kiss and maybe take it too far
But baby take it from me
Oh, just take it from me
But you can steal a kiss, I won't call you a thief
But take it from me
What I got to give you can have for free
Just take it from me
Oh, just take it from me, yeah

[Verse 1]
Lights go down, wheels go 'round
I'm taking you home
Hoping for a slow song to come on the radio now
I'm not ready to shut it down
The way the dashboard glow
Is hitting your eyes making me lose everything on my mind
And the only thing I wanna do is find a spot
Stop this car and throw it in park and just

[Chorus]
Slow dance with you
Spinning you around by the Walmart sign
And moving our feet over the painted white lines
Getting close to you
Making the most of whatever we got
Even if it's just a slow dance in a parking lot
(Slow dance in a parking lot)

[Verse 2]
A half song gone, one door open, across the lot
A rent-a-cop's rolling a security car
Its yellow lights spinning and flashing in time
To the radio singing a little Garth Brooks
You start humming the very last verse to "She's Every Woman"
And I don't care what song comes next
I'm falling right here, don't want a safety net in a

[Chorus]
Slow dance with you
Spinning you around by the Walmart sign
And moving our feet over the painted white lines
Getting close to you
Making the most of whatever we got
Even if it's just a slow dance in a parking lot

[Post-Chorus]
And get close to you
Making the most of whatever we got, even if it's just

[Chorus]
A slow dance with you
Spinning you around by the Walmart sign
And moving our feet over the painted white lines
Getting close to you
Making the most of whatever we got
Even if it's just a slow dance in a parking lot

[Verse 1]
I still got your number and I wonder
What you're doing tonight
I heard you were hurting but he wasn't worth it
Well I could've told you he wasn't right

[Pre-Chorus]
Well some buddies of mine
They said you had a big fight in town
You ran off crying
At least that's what's going around

[Chorus]
Know how those rumors fly
Sometimes they're all a lie
Burn up before they hit the ground
But right now they're going 'round
I don't wanna move in too soon
I know your heartbreak is brand new
If I never would've let you down
This probably wouldn't be going 'round

[Post-Chorus]
(Round and round and round and round)
Probably wouldn't be going 'round

[Verse 2]
It might've been time
And it might've been my bad
But I wanna try again
Another dance
A second chance
If you are in, I'd be in

[Pre-Chorus]
Well some buddies of mine
They said you had a big fight in town
You ran off crying
At least that's what's going around

[Chorus]
Know how those rumors fly
Sometimes they're all a lie
Burn up before they hit the ground
But right now they're going 'round
I don't wanna move in too soon
I know your heartbreak is brand new
If I never would've let you down
This probably wouldn't be going 'round

[Post-Chorus]
Probably wouldn't be going 'round

[Pre-Chorus]
Well some buddies of mine
They said you had a big fight in town
You ran off crying
At least that's what's going 'round

[Chorus]
Know how those rumors fly
Sometimes they're all a lie
Burn up before they hit the ground
But right now they're going 'round
I don't wanna move in too soon
I know your heartbreak is brand new
If I never would've let you down
This probably wouldn't be going 'round

[Post-Chorus]
Probably wouldn't be going 'round

(Round and round and round and round)

[Verse 1]
I'm a bad man
James Dean, kinda Steve McQueen
Straight out the badlands
I rolled in and rained down
Like a storm cloud or a heat wave
Made you stay undercover where it's safe
Don't give a damn about the plans you made
We're staying in the bed all day

[Chorus]
Cause I'm selfish
Restless like a river, can't help it
I'm taking what you give me but I still want more
I still want more
Cause I'm selfish
Yeah I'm selfish, I'm selfish for you

[Verse 2]
Have you seen yourself in a full-length mirror
Spinning around lately
I'd lie, cheat, and steal
Feel the sweet scent overtake me
But the Lord sent an angel to save me
So he can't blame me
When my hands get a mind of their own
Girl, if they get ahold of you, I ain't never letting go

[Chorus]
Cause I'm selfish
Restless like a river, can't help it
I'm taking what you give me but I still want more
I still want more
Cause I'm selfish
Yeah I'm selfish, I'm selfish for you

[Bridge]
Oh, so selfish for you
I still want more
I still want more
I still want more
I still want more

[Chorus]
Cause I'm selfish
Restless like a river, can't help it
I'm taking what you give me but I still want more
I still want more
Cause I'm selfish
Yeah I'm selfish, I'm selfish for you

[Outro]
Still want more
I still want more
I still want more
I still want more
I'm selfish for you

[Verse 1]
I miss the Quarter
The magnolias and the Pontchartrain
French market on a Saturday
I'll miss the feel of this place
I miss the Bayou sunrise
The Mardi Gras and the Saga Lines
Bourbon, jazz, sidewalk kids
With bottle cap taps, dancing for tips

[Chorus]
But I'm leaving New Orleans
There's too much of you in this town
Your memory is like moss in the trees
Every corner it's just hanging around
Well, The Big Easy ain't so easy
Hard to say it but baby come morning
I'll be rolling like the Mississippi leaving New Orleans

[Verse 2]
Well I like highways
So maybe LA is the place for me
If I point these wheels toward the Hollywood sign
All those miles to clear my mind
Or I could watch a horse race on some bluegrass
Where bourbon's made
Catch some rays in the Sunshine State
Hit Seattle if I need a little rain

[Chorus]
But I'm leaving New Orleans
There's too much of you in this town
Your memory's like moss in the trees
Every corner it's just hanging around
Well, The Big Easy ain't so easy
Hard to say it but baby come morning
I'll be rolling like the Mississippi leaving New Orleans

[Bridge]
I guess our good times have rolled away
Well laissez les bons temps rouler

[Chorus]
I'm leaving New Orleans
There's too much of you in this town
Your memory is like moss in the trees
Every corner it's just hanging around
Well, The Big Easy ain't so easy
Hard to say it but baby come morning

[Chorus]
Yeah, I'm Leaving New Orleans
There's too much of you in this town
Your memory is like moss in the trees
Every quarter is just hanging around
Well, The Big Easy ain't so easy
Hard to say it but baby come morning
I'll be rolling like the Mississippi leaving New Orleans

[Outro]
Yeah, I'm leaving New Orleans
Goodbye New Orleans
Leaving New Orleans

[Verse 1]
She's got too much run and too much wild
She don't hold back, no she don't hide
She's always drifting and always dreaming
She's good at loving and better at leaving

[Chorus]
Damn those airplanes and
Damn those fast trains and
Damn those interstates
They always keep calling her
So damn easy for her to leave me
But as long as this world's spinning 'round
I'm gonna love her
Damn she's so tough to tie down
(Tough to tie down)

[Verse 2]
It's who she is so she can't see
That her gypsy side is killing me
And I told myself I should call it quits
But before I can, she's gone again

[Chorus]
Damn those airplanes and
Damn those fast trains and
Damn those interstates
They always keep calling her
So damn easy for her to leave me
But as long as this world's spinning 'round
I'm gonna love her
Damn she's so tough to tie down

[Bridge]
Yeah she knows how to get to me, get to me
Get to me, get to me
Yeah she knows just how to leave, how to leave
She's always leaving me like

[Chorus]
Damn those airplanes and
Damn those fast trains and
Damn those interstates
They always keep calling her
So damn easy for her to leave me
But as long as this world's spinning 'round
I'm gonna love her
Damn she's so tough to tie down

[Outro]
Yeah she's always drifting and always dreaming
She's good at loving but better at leaving

[Verse 1]
Well I know my way
'Round a six string flat top
Hand one over
I can play whatever song you wanna hear
Hand me a bottle
And I'll go full throttle 'til that sun comes up
And the stars hanging in the sky just disappear
But I need help when it comes to you
I don't know what I got into

[Chorus]
You love like a wildfire
Light me up like a live wire
But I can't get enough
You kiss like a hurricane
Off the tracks like a runaway train
But I think I'll try my luck
But I'll roll the dice and play my hand
Oh, I might lose it
Girl, I like the way you're more than I know what to do with

[Verse 2]
What is the deal, cuss and lie
When it comes to a girl like you
You gotta wait too much
Let loose and sometimes I can't believe my eyes
The way you move and the way you dance
I'm like sand running through your hands
I don't know how long I got, but I'm gonna take my chance

[Chorus]
You love like a wildfire
Light me up like a live wire
But I can't get enough
You kiss like a hurricane
Off the tracks like a runaway train
But I think I'll try my luck
But I'll roll the dice and play my hand
Oh, I might lose it
Girl, I like the way you're more than I know what to do with

[Bridge]
Yeah, I need help when it comes to you
I don't know what I got into
Said, I need help when it comes to you
I don't know what I got into

[Chorus]
You love like a wildfire
Light me up like a live wire
But I can't get enough
You kiss like a hurricane
Off the tracks like a runaway train
But I think I'll try my luck
But I'll roll the dice and play my hand
Oh, I might lose it
Girl, I like the way you're more than I know what to do with

[Verse 1]
Last night it was so real
I can still feel
You all over me
And I woke up reaching for you
Wanting to hold you
Damn everything felt right
Last night

[Chorus]
When you called me
Said you want me
Told me you were coming over
Said you're running red lights
At 85 and getting closer
A kiss at the door, ended up on the floor
Ain't too sure what hurts more
That you didn't or that I dreamed you did

[Verse 2]
Yeah we said everything we didn't say
Without saying a word at all
I tried like hell to fall back asleep
Just to see if maybe we
Could pick back up where we left off

[Chorus]
When you called me
Said you want me
Told me you were coming over
Said you're running red lights
At 85 and getting closer
A kiss at the door, ended up on the floor
Ain't too sure what hurts more
That you didn't or that I dreamed you did

[Bridge]
Is it worse that you're so gone
That I don't even cross your mind
Or that I'll be dreaming that you're coming back again tonight

[Chorus]
When you called me
Said you want me
Told me you were coming over
Said you're running red lights
At 85 and getting closer
A kiss at the door, ended up on the floor
Ain't too sure what hurts more
That you didn't or that I dreamed you did

[Outro]
I dreamed you did
Yeah I dreamed you did
Yeah I dreamed you did

[Verse 1]
Well if you got a plan in mind
Tell me when and where and I'm down
Girl, I'm so down
Cause we ain't got nothing but time
I want to know what you're thinking about
So just let it out

[Pre-Chorus]
Cause we got the start of something good
And it's starting right now
There's no needing dancing around
What we've lucked into
And you look like you

[Chorus]
Wanna catch a red-eye to the coast somewhere
Watch the moon fall and listen to the waves roll by
So do I
If you see a Santa Fe sunset, a burning red sky
As the backdrop of your lips getting closer to mine
So do I
If you don't want to say goodbye just yet
Think we got a lot more left to do tonight, yeah tonight
So do I

[Verse 2]
Maybe it's just one more drink
Just you and me watching that clock spin 'round
And 'round
I just want to do what you're thinking
I'm up for staying or leaving this town

[Chorus]
If you wanna catch a red-eye to the coast somewhere
Watch the moon fall and listen to the waves roll by
So do I
If you see a Santa Fe sunset, a burning red sky
As the backdrop of your lips getting closer to mine
So do I
If you don't want to say goodbye just yet
Think we got a lot more left to do tonight, yeah tonight
So do I

[Chorus]
If you wanna catch a red-eye to the coast somewhere
Watch the moon fall and listen to the waves roll by
So do I
If you see a Santa Fe sunset, a burning red sky
As the backdrop of your lips getting closer to mine
So do I
If you don't want to say goodbye just yet
Think we got a lot more left to do tonight, yeah tonight
So do I
So do I

[Verse 1]
You're a vodka drink
With two lemons and no lime
You won't listen to the words
But you'll sing 'em when they rhyme
You're a Sunday backwards ball cap
Drive too fast when it rains
And you talk like you're from Charleston
But you're just made that way

[Chorus]
Put together like an angel
Tempted by your every tangle
Bet you don't even know how
I'm hanging on to every word you say
Every touch damn near kills me
Never thought that anybody
Could make me want to slow down and stay
But baby you're made that way

[Verse 2]
You don't overthink
So you're a complicated mess
Not afraid to make mistakes
Hold your cards close to the vest
You're Christmas lights in August
Won't wake up 'til 10 a.m
And my heart pounds just like a kick drum
Anytime that you walk in

[Chorus]
Put together like an angel
Tempted by your every tangle
Bet you don't even know how
I'm hanging on to every word you say
Every touch damn near kills me
Never thought that anybody
Could make me want to slow down and stay
But baby you're made that way

[Bridge]
Everything falls into place
As soon as I see your face
Don't stop loving me
Baby don't stop loving me

[Chorus]
Put together like an angel
Tempted by your every tangle
Bet you don't even know how
I'm hanging on to every word you say
Every touch damn near kills me
Never thought that anybody
Could make me want to slow down and stay
Baby you're made that way

[Outro]
Yeah you were made that way
Baby you were made that way

[Verse 1]
Waves crashing on her feet
Standing in some rolled up jeans
Making tracks in the sand
It's like she's living in a photograph
But disappearing silouhette
Flip flops in her hands

[Pre-Chorus 1]
And every kiss is burnt and hot
I can't let them go to waste
Let's say the night is all that we've got
And I'm ready for the chase

[Chorus]
We can be sundowners, edge of towners
Waiting on a spark
Silent sounders, come unwounders
Tangled in the dark
Like the moon is hanging lets keep this dream awake
Let's go out into the AM
But tonight let's be some sundowners (sundowners)

[Verse 2]
Blue gives into the black
Red lips just like a match
That sets me on fire
While the whole world falls asleep
Every look that you're giving me
Is taking me higher

[Pre-Chorus 2]
And every kiss is burnt and hot
I can't let them go to waste
And once we start, we can't stop
Like 80 with no brakes

[Chrous]
We can be sundowners, edge of towners
Waiting on a spark
Silent sounders, come unwounders
Tangled in the dark
Like the moon is hanging, lets keep this dream awake
Let's go out into the AM
But tonight let's be some sundowners (sundowners)

[Bridge]
We can be the only two up
When they close down this town
Lets just live it up til it comes back around
We can be sundowners
We can be come unwounders

[Chorus]
Sundowners, edge of towners
Waiting on a spark
Silent sounders, come unwounders
Tangled in the dark
Like the moon is hanging, lets keep this dream awake
Let's go out until the AM
But tonight let's be some sundowners

[Outro]
Let's just be some come unwounders
We can be some play it louders
Gotta start sundowners
(Yeah) Sundowners

Sundowners

Let's just be some sundowners

[Verse 1]
You know there's a light that glows by the front door
Don't forget the keys under the mat
When childhood stars shine
Always stay humble and kind
Go to church 'cause your momma says to
Visit grandpa every chance that you can
It won't be wasted time
Always stay humble and kind

[Chorus]
Hold the door, say please, say thank you
Don't steal, don't cheat, and don't lie
I know you got mountains to climb but
Always stay humble and kind
When the dreams you're dreamin' come to you
When the work you put in is realized
Let yourself feel the pride but
Always stay humble and kind

[Verse 2]
Don't expect a free ride from no one
Don't hold a grudge or a chip and here's why
Bitterness keeps you from flyin'
Always stay humble and kind
Know the difference between sleepin' with someone
And sleepin' with someone you love
"I love you" ain't no pickup line, so
Always stay humble and kind

[Chorus]
Hold the door, say please, say thank you
Don't steal, don't cheat, and don't lie
I know you got mountains to climb but
Always stay humble and kind
When those dreams you're dreamin' come to you
When the work you put in is realized
Let yourself feel the pride but
Always stay humble and kind (Yeah)

[Outro]
When it's hot, eat a root beer popsicle
Shut off the AC and roll the windows down
Let that summer sun shine
Always stay humble and kind
Don't take for granted the love this life gives you
When you get where you're goin', don't forget turn back around
And help the next one in line
Always stay humble and kind

[Verse 1: Tim McGraw]
Runnin round in this new truck
Bank lets me borrow from month to month
I'm runnin out of credit, find a little Cash on the radio
Standin still they're blowin past, numbers on cars goin NASCAR fast
What I wouldn't give for a slow down, don't ya know?
'Cause where I come from, only the horses run
When the day is done, we take it easy

[Chorus: Tim McGraw]
Meanwhile back at Mama's
The porch light's on, come on in if you wanna
Supper's on the stove and beer's in the fridge
Red sun sinkin' out low on the ridge
Game's on the tube and Daddy smokes cigarettes
Whiskey keeps his whistle wet
Funny the things you thought you'd never miss
In a world gone crazy as this

[Verse 2: Tim McGraw]
Well I found a girl and we don't fit in here
Talk about how hard it is to breathe here
Even with the windows down can't catch a southern breeze here
One of these days gonna pack it up and leave here
Cause

[Chorus: Tim McGraw and Faith Hill]
Meanwhile back at Mama's
The porch light's on, come on in if you wanna
Supper's on the stove and beer's in the fridge
Red sun sinkin' out low on the ridge
Game's on the tube and Daddy smokes cigarettes
Whiskey keeps his whistle wet
Funny the things you thought you'd never miss
In a world gone crazy as this

[Bridge: Tim McGraw and Faith Hill]
Oh I miss yeah a little dirt on the road, I miss corn growin in a row
I miss being somebody everybody knows, there everybody knows everybody
I miss those small town routes, walkin around in muddy boots
The sound of rain on an old tin roof
It's time we head on back

[Final Chorus: Tim McGraw and Faith Hill]
Cause meanwhile back at Mama's
The for sale sign's goin up and I'm gonna
Dump this truck and the little I got
On a loan to own and a three-acre lot
Put supper on the stove and beer in the fridge
Goin' for broke and we're gonna be rich
Watch the sun settin on the ridge
Baby tell me what you think about this

[Outro:Tim McGraw and Faith Hill]
Me and you back at Mama's
Yeah me and you back at Mama's

[Verse 1]
We could have a little double wide planted in an empty field
We could have a big old white picket wrap around on a hill
Don't make a difference to me baby, where the wind takes me, long as I'm with you, girl
We could have something or nothing, still be sitting on top of the world

[Chorus]
'Cause when you got love, like we got love
I'm holding on to heaven, holding on to you
When you got one like I got one
Anyway you looking, it's a hell of a view

[Post-Chorus]
Don't know where we're gonna be
But I know we're gonna be
Sitting on top of the world
So keep hanging on to me
Yeah, don't you wanna be
Sitting on top of the world
Top of the world

[Verse 2]
We could be rolling on a couple of Goodyears and painted rust
We could be strolling barefoot in the sand, in the setting sun
Yeah, any way you kiss me flips me and gets me the right kind of tipsy, girl
We could be somewhere or nowhere and still be sitting on top of the world

[Chorus]
'Cause when you got love, like we got love
I'm holding on to heaven, holding on to you
When you got one like I got one
Anyway you looking, it's a hell of a view

[Post-Chorus]
Don't know where we're gonna be
But I know we're gonna be
Sitting on top of the world
So keep hanging on to me
Yeah, don't you wanna be
Sitting on top of the world
Top of the world

[Instrumental Bridge]
Top of the world

[Chorus]
'Cause when you got love, like we got love
I'm holding on to heaven, holding on to you
When you got one like I got one
Anyway you looking, it's a hell of a view
'Cause when you got love, like we got love
I'm holding on to heaven, holding on to you
When you got one like I got one
Anyway you looking, it's a hell of a view

[Post-Chorus]
Don't know where we're gonna be
But I know we're gonna be
Sitting on top of the world
So keep hanging on to me
Yeah, don't you wanna be
Sitting on top of the world
Top of the world

[Outro]
'Cause when you got love like we got love
Sitting on top of the world
'Cause when you got love like we got love
Sitting on top of the world
'Cause when you got love like we got love
Sitting on top of the world
'Cause when you got love like we got love
Sitting on top of the world

[Verse 1]
Roll, won't you come roll with me
Slow, fast, full speed
Girl where ever sweet time takes us
Hang, with me down this old road
Only God knows where we'll go
Don't matter long as I've got your love

[Chorus]
I don't ever wanna wake up
Looking into someone else's eyes
With another voice calling me "baby"
On the other end of the phone
A new girl puttin' on her make up
For a dinner on a Friday night
I don't ever wanna know, no, no, no
No other shotgun rider beside me
Singin' to the radio, ooo, oo

[Verse 2]
Slide, slide over nice and close
Lay your head down on my shoulder
You can fall asleep, I'll let you
Dream, life ain't nothing but a dream
Don't wanna be, cruisin' through this dream without you

[Chorus]
I don't ever wanna wake up
Looking into someone else's eyes
Another voice calling me "baby"
On the other end of the phone
A new girl puttin' on her make up
For a dinner on a Friday night
No I don't ever wanna know, no, no, no
No other shotgun rider beside me
Singin' to the radio, ooo, oo

[Verse 1: Tim McGraw]
Bet your window's rolled down and your hair's pulled back
And I bet you got no idea you're going way too fast
You're trying not to think about what went wrong
Trying not to stop 'til you get where you goin'
You're trying to stay awake so I bet you turn on the radio
And the song goes

[Pre-Chorus: Taylor Swift]
I can't live without you, I can't live without you, baby
I can't live without you, I can't live without you, baby, oh, baby

[Chorus:Tim McGraw]
The highway won't hold you tonight
The highway don't know you're alive
The highway don't care if you're all alone
But I do, I do
The highway won't dry your tears
The highway don't need you here
The highway don't care if you're coming home
But I do, I do

[Verse 2: Tim McGraw & Taylor Swift]
I bet you got a dead cell phone in your shotgun seat
Yeah, I bet you're bending God's ear talking 'bout me
You're trying not to let the first tear fall out
You're trying not to think about turning around
You're trying not to get lost in the sound but that song is always on
So you sing along

[Pre-Chorus: Taylor Swift]
I can't live without you, I can't live without you, baby
I can't live without you, I can't live without you, baby, oh baby

[Chorus: Tim McGraw]
The highway won't hold you tonight
The highway don't know you're alive
The highway don't care if you're all alone
But I do, I do
The highway won't dry your tears
The highway don't need you here
The highway don't care if you're coming home
But I do, I do

[Pre-Chorus: Taylor Swift]
I can't live without you, I can't live without you, baby
I can't live without you, I can't live without you, baby, oh baby

[Bridge: Tim McGraw & Taylor Swift]
The highway don't care
The highway don't care
The highway don't care
But I do, I do
I can't live without you, I can't live without you, baby
I can't live without I can't live without you, baby, oh baby
The highway don't care
The highway don't care
The highway don't care
But I do, I do
I can't live without you, I can't live without you, baby
I can't live without I can't live without you, baby
The highway don't care
The highway don't care
The highway don't care
But I do, I do
I can't live without you, I can't live without you, baby
I can't live without I can't live without you, baby, oh baby
The highway don't care
The highway don't care
The highway don't care
But I do, I do

[Outro: Taylor Swift]
I can't live without you, I can't live without you, baby

[Verse 1]
Johnny's daddy was takin' him fishin'
When he was eight years old
A little girl came through the front gate
Holdin' a fishin' pole
His dad looked down and smiled
Said, "We can't leave her behind
Son, I know you don't want her to go
But someday you'll change your mind"

[Pre-Chorus]
And Johnny said:

[Chorus 1]
Take Jimmy Johnson, take Tommy Thompson
Take my best friend, Bo
Take anybody that you want as
Long as she don't go
Take any boy in the world
Daddy, please, don't take the girl

[Verse 2]
Same old boy, same sweet girl
Ten years down the road
He held her tight and kissed her lips in
Front of the picture show
Stranger came and pulled a gun
Grabbed her by the arm
Said, "If you do what I tell you to, there
Won't be any harm"

[Pre-Chorus]
And Johnny said:

[Chorus 2]
Take my money, take my wallet
Take my credit cards
Here's the watch that my grandpa gave me
Here's the key to my car
Mister, give it a whirl
But, please, don't take the girl

[Verse 3]
Same old boy, same sweet girl
Five years down the road
There's gonna be a little one and she
Says, "It's time to go"
Doctor says, "The baby's fine
But you'll have to leave
'Cause his momma's fadin' fast" and
Johnny hit his knees

[Pre-Chorus]
And then he prayed:

[Chorus 3]
Take the very breath you gave me
Take the heart from my chest
I'll gladly take her place if you'll let me
Make this my last request
Take me out of this world
God, please, don't take the girl

[Outro]
Johnny's daddy
Was takin' him fishin'
When he was eight years old

[Verse 1: Tim McGraw]
I want to drink that shot of whiskey
I want to smoke that cigarette
I want to smell that sweet addiction on my breath
I want to ride across West Virginia in the backseat of a Cadillac
You know some cowboys like me go out like that
So I need you

[Chorus: Tim McGraw]
Like a needle needs a vein
Like my Uncle Joe in Oklahoma needs a rain
I need you like a lighthouse on the coast
Like the father and the son meet the holy ghost
I need you

[Verse 2: Faith Hill]
I want to get lost in some corner booth
Cantina Mexico
I want to dance to the static of an a.m. radio
I want to wrap the moon around us and lay beside you skin on skin
Make love 'til the sun comes up til the sun goes down again
'Cause I need you

[Chorus: Faith Hill]
Like a needle needs a vein
Like my Uncle Joe in Oklahoma needs a rain
I need you like a lighthouse on the coast
Like the father and the son meet the holy ghost
I need you
Oh, I need you

[Verse 3: Tim McGraw]
I want to drink that shot of whiskey
I want to smoke that cigarette
You know some cowboys like me go out like that
So I need you, oh, I need you
I need you, I need you, I need you, I need you

[Outro]
Oh, I need you, I need you
I need you, I need you
I need you, I need you, I need you, too

[Verse 1]
Saw a young Mama laughin' talkin' on the phone
With a little girl workin' on an ice cream cone
Drippin' on her shoes
And I thought about you

[Verse 2]
Saw a spring break Honda hell-bent for Daytona
The boys in the back hiding their Corona
Like kids do
And I thought about you

[Pre-Chorus]
I thought about me
I thought about God
Everything love is
And everything it's not

[Chorus]
I thought about songs that make us feel better
I thought about faith that ties it all together
I thought about now, then thought about forever
I thought about fire and how we walked through it
The times I got it right, the times I blew it
I thought about real, I thought about good, I thought about true
And I thought about you

[Verse 3]
I saw "hungry" misspelled on a cardboard sign
And a dirty t-shirt that said "Roll Tide"
So I gave him a few
And I thought about you

[Verse 4]
Ran into a buddy, he said "How long's it been?"
I said "A couple years," he said "Boy, it's been ten"
That's what time'll do
And I thought about you

[Chorus]
I thought about songs that make us feel better
I thought about faith that ties it all together
I thought about now, then thought about forever
I thought about fire and how we walked through it
The times I got it right, the times I blew it
I thought about real, I thought about good, I thought about true
And I thought about you
I thought about you

[Post-Chorus]
I thought about me
I thought about God
Everything love is
And everything it's not

[Verse 5]
I saw a red balloon somebody just let fly
I watched it gettin' smaller up in the sky
For a minute or two
And I thought about you

[Verse 1]
Don't you remember
The fizz in a pepper
Peanuts in a bottle
At ten, two and four
A fried bologna sandwich
With mayo and tomato
Sittin' round the table
Do not happen much anymore

[Pre-Chorus 1]
We got too complicated
It's all way over-rated
I like the old and out-dated
Way of life

[Chorus]
Back when a ho was a ho
Coke was a Coke
And crack's what you were doing
When you were cracking jokes
Back when a screw was a screw
The wind was all that blew
And when you said I am down with that
Well it meant you had the flu
I miss back when
I miss back when
I miss back when

[Verse 2]
I love my records
Black, shiny vinyl
Clicks and pops
And white noise
Man they sounded fine
I had my favorite stations
The ones that played 'em all
Country, soul and rock-n-roll
What happened to those times

[Pre-Chorus 2]
I am reading Street Slang For Dummies
'Cause they put pop in my country
I want more for my money
The way it was back then

[Chorus]
Back when a ho was a ho
Coke was a Coke
And crack's what you were doing
When you were cracking jokes
Back when a screw was a screw
The wind was all that blew
And when you said I am down with that
Well it meant you had the flu
I miss back when
I miss back when
I miss back when

[Bridge]
Give me a flat top for strummin'
I want the whole world to be hummin'
Oh, just keep it comin'
The way it was back then

[Chorus]
Back when a ho was a ho
Coke was a Coke
And crack's what you were doing
When you were cracking jokes
Back when a screw was a screw
The wind was all that blew
And when you said I am down with that
Well it meant you had the flu
I miss back when
I miss back when
I miss back when
I miss back when
I miss back when

[Verse 1]
You always had an eye for things that glittered
But I was far from bein' made of gold
I don't know how but I scraped up the money
I just never could quite tell you no
Just like when you were leavin' Amarillo
Takin' that new job in Tennessee
And I quit mine so we could be together
I can't forget the way you looked at me

[Chorus]
Just to see you smile
I'd do anything, that you wanted me to
When all is said and done
I'd never count the cost
It's worth all that's lost
Just to see you smile

[Verse 2]
When you said time was all you really needed
I walked away and let you have your space
'Cause leavin' didn't hurt me near as badly
As the tears I saw rollin' down your face
And yesterday I knew just what you wanted
When you came walkin' up to me with him
So I told you that I was happy for you
And given the chance I'd lie again

[Chorus]
Just to see you smile
I'd do anything, that you wanted me to
When all is said and done
I'd never count the cost
It's worth all that's lost
Just to see you smile

[Chorus]
Just to see you smile
I'd do anything, that you wanted me to
When all is said and done
I'd never count the cost
It's worth all that's lost
Just to see you smile

[Verse 1]
I never had no one, that I could count on
I've been let down so many times
And I was tired of hurtin', so tired of searchin'
Till you walked into my life
It was a feeling, I'd never known
And for the first time, I didn't feel alone

[Chorus]
You're more than a lover, there could never be another
To make me feel the way you do
Oh we just get closer, I fall in love all over
Every time I look at you
I don't know where I'd be, without you here with me
Life with you makes perfect sense
You're my best friend
You're my best friend, oh yeah

[Verse 2]
You stand by me, and you believe in me
Like nobody ever has
When my world goes crazy, you're right there to save me
You make me see how much I have
And I still tremble, when we touch
And, oh, the look in your eyes, when we make love

[Chorus]
You're more than a lover, there could never be another
To make me feel the way you do
Oh we just get closer, I fall in love all over
Every time I look at you
And I don't know where I'd be, without you here with me
Life with you makes perfect sense
You're my best friend, ooh-oh oh
You're my best friend

[Chorus]
You're more than a lover, there could never be another
To make me feel the way you do
Oh we just get closer, I fall in love all over
Every time I look at you
And I don't know where I'd be, without you here with me
Life with you makes perfect sense
You're my best friend
You're my best friend (my best friend)
You're my best friend (my best friend)

[Verse 1]
Gotta hold on easy as I let you go
Gonna tell you how much I love you, though you think you already know
I remember I thought you looked like an angel wrapped in pink so soft and warm
You've had me wrapped around your finger since the day you were born

[Chorus]
You're beautiful baby from the outside in
Chase your dreams but always know the road that'll lead you home again
Go on, take on this whole world
But to me you know you'll always be, my little girl

[Verse 2]
When you were in trouble that crooked little smile could melt my heart of stone
Now look at you, I've turned around and you've almost grown
Sometimes you're asleep I whisper "I Love You!" in the moonlight at your door
As I walk away, I hear you say, "Daddy Love You More!"

[Chorus]
You're beautiful baby from the outside in
Chase your dreams but always know the road that'll lead you home again
Go on, take on this whole world
But to me you know you'll always be, my little girl

[Verse 3]
Someday, some boy will come and ask me for your hand
But I won't say "yes" to him unless I know, he's the half
That makes you whole, he has a poet's soul, and the heart of a man's man
I know he'll say that he's in love
But between you and me, he won't be good enough!

[Chorus]
You're beautiful baby from the outside in
Chase your dreams but always know the road that'll lead you home again
Go on, take on this whole world
But to me you know you'll always be, my little girl

[Verse 1: Tim McGraw]
Dancin' in the dark, middle of the night
Takin' your heart and holdin' it tight
Emotional touch, touchin' my skin
And askin' you to do what you've been doin' all over again

[Pre-Chorus: Tim McGraw]
Oh, it's a beautiful thing
Don't think I can keep it all in
I just gotta let you know
What it is that won't let me go

[Chorus: Tim McGraw & Faith Hill]
It's your love
It just does something to me
It sends a shock right through me
I can't get enough
And if you wonder
About the spell I'm under
It's your love

[Verse 2: Tim McGraw & Faith Hill]
Better than I was, more than I am
And all of this happened by takin' your hand
And who I am now is who I wanted to be
And now that we're together, I'm stronger than ever
I'm happy and free

[Pre-Chorus: Tim McGraw & Faith Hill]
Oh, it's a beautiful thing
Don't think I can keep it all in, no
And if you asked me why I changed
All I gotta do is say your sweet name

[Chorus: Tim McGraw & Faith Hill]
It's your love
It just does somethin' to me
It sends a shock right through me
I can't get enough
And if you wonder
About the spell I'm under
It's your love
Oh, baby

[Pre-Chorus: Tim McGraw & Faith Hill]
Oh, it's a beautiful thing
Don't think I can keep it all in
I just gotta let you know
What it is that won't let me go

[Chorus: Tim McGraw & Faith Hill]
It's your love
It just does something' to me
It sends a shock right through me
I can't get enough
And if you wonder
About the spell I'm under
It's your love

[Outro: Tim McGraw & Faith Hill]
It's your love
It's your love

[Verse 1]
I need Jesus or I need whiskey
Whatever works best to get me through
Gettin' over you
A little Friday night hallelujah
A congregation of backsliders just like me
Yeah, what I need

[Chorus]
Is a neon church
With a jukebox choir
Full of honky tonk angels
With their wings on fire
Straight pourin' out that Johnnie Walker healin'
I got a feelin'
I need a neon church

[Verse 2]
Baptize me in that barroom smoke
Bartender, preach to me 'til my heart ain't broke no more
Ain't that what this place is for?
I tried bended knee, hands-up prayin'
But damn did that hurt, don't just keep hangin' around
What I need right now

[Chorus]
Is a neon church
With a jukebox choir
Full of honky tonk angels
With their wings on fire
Straight pourin' out that Johnnie Walker healin'
I got a feelin'
I need a neon church

[Bridge]
Just a-sippin' down that unholy water
Save that hurt-like-hell for tomorrow
I'll stay here all night
In a neon church
With the party crowd
Where the good times roll
And the music's loud
Instead of home starin' holes in the ceiling
I got a feeling

[Chorus]
I need a neon church
With a jukebox choir
Full of honky tonk angels
With their wings on fire
Straight pourin' out that Johnnie Walker healin'
I got a feelin'
I need a neon church
I need a neon church

[Verse 1]
Diamond rings and old barstools
One's for queens and one's for fools
One's the future and one's the past
One's forever and one won't last

[Chorus]
It ain't like midnight and cigarette smoke
It ain't like watered down whiskey and Coke
I guess some things just don't mix like you hoped
Like me and you
And diamond rings and old barstools

[Verse 2]
The wrongs and rights, the highs and lows
The "I love yous," the "I told you sos"
Past few miles to wherever's home
Another morning waking up alone

[Chorus]
It ain't like midnight and cigarette smoke
It ain't like watered down whiskey and Coke
I guess some things just don't mix like you hoped
Like me and you
And diamond rings and old barstools

[Outro]
We ain't like midnight and cigarette smoke
Nothing like watered down whiskey and Coke
I guess some things just don't mix like you hoped
Like me and you
And diamond rings and old barstools

[Verse 1]
I was twenty and she was eighteen
We were just as wild as we were green, in the ways of the world
She picked me up in that red rag top
We were free of the folks and hiding from the cops
On a summer night running all the red lights
We parked way out in a clearing in a grove and the night
Was hot as a coal burning' stove
We were cooking the gas we were had to last

[Chorus]
In the back of that red rag top
She said please don't stop

[Verse 2]
Well the very first time her mother met me
Her green-eyed girl was a mother to be for 2 weeks
I was out of a job and she was in school
Life was fast and the world was cruel

We were young and wild
We decided not to have a child
So we did what we did and we tried to forget
And we swore up and down
There would be no regrets
In the morning light
But on the way home that night

[Chorus 2]
On the back of that red rag top
She said please don't stop
Loving me

[Verse 3]
We took one more trip around the sun
It was all make believe in the end
No I can't say where she is today
I can't remember who I was back then
Well, you do what you do and you pay for your sins

And there's no such thing as what might've been
That's a waste of time; drive you outta your mind
I was stopped at a red light just yesterday
Beside a young girl in a cabriolet
And her eyes were green
I was in an old scene

[Outro]
I was back in that red rag top
On the day she stopped
Loving me
I was back in that red rag top
On the day she stopped
Loving me

[Verse 1]
If you're reading this, my Momma's sitting there
Looks like I only got a one-way ticket over here
Sure wish I could give you one more kiss
And war was just a game we played when we were kids

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm laying down my gun
I'm hanging up boots
I'm up here with God and we're both watching over you

[Chorus]
So lay me down
In that open field out on the edge of town
And know my soul
Is where my momma always prayed
That it would go
And if you're reading this
I'm already home

[Verse 2]
If you're reading this
Halfway around the world
I won’t be there
To see the birth of our little girl
I hope she looks like you
I hope she fights like me
Stand up for the innocent and the weak

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm laying down my gun
I'm hanging up boots
Tell dad I don't regret that I followed in his shoes

[Chorus]
So lay me down
In that open field out on the edge of town
And know my soul
Is where my momma always prayed
That it would go
And if you're reading this
I'm already home

[Verse 3]
If you're reading this
There’s going to come a day
When you'll move on
And find someone else
And that's OK
Just remember this
I'm in a better place
Where soldiers live in peace
And angels sing amazing grace

[Chorus]
So lay me down
In that open field out on the edge of town
And know my soul
Is where my momma always prayed
That it would go
And if you're reading this
If you're reading this
I'm already home

[Intro]
I'm an Indian outlaw
Half Cherokee and Choctaw
My baby she's a Chippewa
She's one of a kind

[Verse 1]
All my friends call me Bear Claw
The Village Chieftain is my paw-paw
He gets his orders from my maw-maw
She makes him walk the line
You can find me in my wigwam
I'll be beatin' on my tom-tom
Pull out the pipe and smoke you some
Hey and pass it around

[Chorus]
'Cause I'm an Indian outlaw
Half Cherokee and Choctaw
My baby she's a Chippewa
She's one of a kind

[Verse 2]
I ain't lookin' for trouble
We can ride my pony double
Make your little heart bubble
Lord, like a glass of wine
I remember the medicine man
He caught Running Water in my hands
Drug me around by my headband
Said I wasn't her kind

[Chorus]
'Cause I'm an Indian outlaw
Half Cherokee and Choctaw
My baby she's a Chippewa
She's one of a kind

[Verse 3]
I can kill a deer or buffalo
With just my arrow and my hickory bow
From a hundred yards don't you know
I do it all the time
They all gather 'round my teepee
Late at night tryin' to catch a peek at me
In nothin' but my buffalo briefs
I got them standin' in line

[Chorus]
'Cause I'm an Indian outlaw
Half Cherokee and Choctaw
My baby she's a Chippewa
She's one of a kind

[Bridge]
Cherokee people
Cherokee tribe
So proud to live
So proud to die

[Verse 1]
Look what you have overcome to get here
Look at the distance you've run
The doubts that you’ve pushed down
Fear that you've drowned out
When they said that it couldn't be done

[Chorus]
In your head, in your heart, in your hands
In your head, In your heart, in your hands
In your head, in your heart, in your hands
Gravity is a fragile thing

[Verse 2]
All of the words that you left in your throat
All of the dreams unlocked
Now you can finally see them
They meet you at your destination
Now that you have made it so far

[Chorus]
In your head, in your heart, in your hands
In your head, in your heart, in your hands
In your head, in your heart, in your hands
Gravity is a fragile thing

[Bridge]
It don’t define you
Gravity will lie to you, lie to you

[Outro]
Tell them to never let go
There is a beautiful valley below
When you hold on so tightly to the dream
Gravity is just a fragile thing

[Verse 1]
I'm a little more beer bottle beer joint than a fancy bar
I'm a little more sitting up high on the road than a little car
I'm a little more bust ya back than take it for free
And that’s how I'll always be
I'm a little more lose my temper than to sit on back
I'm a little more ol' Hank Williams than that trendy crap
I love a flat wood ol' front porch made of an old oak tree
And that's how I'll always be

[Chorus]
I'll always be a fan of ol' stray dogs and guitars playin'
One room churches, back road walks and front porch swingin'
Sunset skies, bonfire nights, I love the simple things
That's how I'll always be

[Verse 2]
I got friends that say I live a little like Cool Hand Luke
Fast cars and motorcycles, raisin' hell in cowboy boots
But, hey, on Sunday morning, I'll take the back row seat
That's how I'll always be

[Chorus]
I'll always be a fan of ol' stray dogs and guitars playin'
One room churches, back road walks and front porch swingin'
Sunset skies, bonfire nights, I love the simple things
That's how I'll always be

[Bridge]
I'm a fan of chert rock bouncing off a Chevy fender
That feeling that you get that first time she lets ya kiss her
Rusty roofs that rattle when the rain is fallin' down
Handshake deals, fresh-cut hay fields, and hometowns

[Chorus]
I'll always be a fan of ol' stray dogs and guitars playin'
One room churches, back road walks and front porch swingin'
Sunset skies, bonfire nights, I love the simple things
That's how I'll always be
That's how I'll always be
That's how I'll always be
That's how I'll always be

[Verse 1]
Spent forty-eight dollars last night at the county fair
I threw out my shoulder but I won her that teddy bear
She's got me sayin' sugar-pie, honey, darlin', and dear
I ain't seen the Braves play a game all year
I'm gonna get fired if I don't get some sleep
My long lost buddies say I'm gettin' in too deep

[Chorus]
But I like it, I love it, I want some more of it
I try so hard, I can't rise above it
Don't know what it is 'bout that little gal's lovin'
But I like it, I love it, I want some more of it

[Verse 2]
My Mama and Daddy tried to teach me courtesy
But it never sank in 'til that girl got a hold of me
Now I'm holdin' umbrellas and openin' up doors
I'm takin' out the trash and I'm sweepin' my floors
I'm crossin' my fingers and countin' every kiss
Prayin' that it keeps goin' on like this

[Chorus]
'Cause I like it, I love it, I want some more of it
I try so hard, I can't rise above it
Don't know what it is 'bout that little gal's lovin'
But I like it, I love it, I want some more of it

[Bridge]
Gotta wash my truck and dress up
To pick her up to watch TV
And she sits down on the sofa, she'll move a little closer
She can't get enough of me

[Chorus]
Yeah, I like it, I love it, I want some more of it
I try so hard, I can't rise above it
Don't know what it is 'bout that little gal's lovin'
But I like it, I love it, I want some more of it

[Outro]
Come on, baby
You know what I like
Yeah, I like that
Mmm, mmm, mmm
Hey, don't forget to turn out the lights

[Verse 1]
Now I ain't sayin' them LA ladies don't know what they're doing
And I been in love with New York City a time or two
I had some Seattle coffee, some Chicago wind
Some Kansas sweet fields I'd love to see again
But the fireflies play where the cattails grow
And them southern girls, they talk nice and slow with

[Chorus]
Kisses sweeter than Tupelo honey
Little bit crazy like New Orleans
Memphis blue and Daytona sunny
Soft as cotton in some cutoff jeans
Don't you know
Ain't nothing in the whole wide world
Like a southern girl

[Post-Chorus]
Southern girl rock my world
Hazel eyes and golden curls
Put on a country song
We'll dance all night long

[Verse 2]
A southern girl's mama probably taught her how a lady should act
But a southern girl's probably got a barn somewhere reared out back
She'll get a little hay in her hair, her tires in the mud
She's been caught in the rain, and washed in the blood
Likes cherries in her coke, takes a little sip
Comes over to me with them sunburned lips and them

[Chorus]
Kisses sweeter than Tupelo honey
Little bit crazy like New Orleans
Memphis blue and Daytona sunny
Soft as cotton in some cutoff jeans
Don't you know
Ain't nothing in the whole wide world
Like a southern girl

[Bridge]
If you've ever seen Savannah heat up when the stars come out
Well, then, fellas, come on, you know what I'm talking about

[Chorus]
Kisses sweeter than Tupelo honey
Little bit crazy like New Orleans
Memphis blue and Daytona sunny
Soft as cotton in some cutoff jeans
Don't you know
Ain't nothing in the whole wide world
Like a southern girl

[Post-Chorus]
Southern girl rock my world
Hazel eyes and golden curls
Put on a country song
We'll dance all night long

[Verse 1]
Six lanes, taillights
Red ants marchin' into the night
They disappear to the left and right, again
Another supper, from a sack
A ninety-nine cent heart attack
I got a poundin' head, and an achin' back
And the camel's buried in a big straw stack

[Chorus]
I'm gonna live where the green grass grows
Watch my corn pop up in rows
Every night be tucked in close to you
Raise our kids where the good Lord's blessed
Point our rockin' chairs towards the west
And plant our dreams where the peaceful river flows
Where the green grass grows

[Verse 2]
Well I'm from a map dot
A stop sign on a black top
I caught the first bus I could hop from there
But all of this glitter is a-gettin' dark
There's concrete growin' in the city park
I don't know who my neighbors are
And there's bars on the corners and bars on my heart

[Chorus]
I'm gonna live where the green grass grows
Watch my corn pop up in rows
Every night be tucked in close to you
Raise our kids where the good Lord's blessed
Point our rockin' chairs towards the west
And plant our dreams where the peaceful river flows
Where the green grass grows

[Chorus]
I'm gonna live where the green grass grows
Watchin' my corn pop up in rows
Every night be tucked in close to you
Raise our kids where the good Lord's blessed
Point our rockin' chairs towards the west
And plant our dreams where the peaceful river flows
Where the green grass grows

[Verse 1]
It was Labor Day weekend I was seventeen
I bought a Coke and some gasoline
And I drove out to the county fair
When I saw her for the first time
She was standing there in the ticket line
And it all started right then and there
Oh, a sailor’s sky made a perfect sunset
And that's the day I'll never forget

[Chorus]
I had a barbeque stain on my white tee shirt
She was killing me in that miniskirt
Skipping rocks on the river by the railroad tracks
She had a suntan line and red lipstick
I worked so hard for that first kiss
And a heart don't forget something like that

[Verse 2]
Well it was five years later on a southbound plane
I was headed down to New Orleans
To meet some friends of mine for Mardi Gras
When I heard a voice from the past
Coming from a few rows back
And when I looked, I couldn't believe just what I saw
She said I bet you don't remember me
And I said only every other memory

[Chorus]
I had a barbeque stain on my white tee shirt
She was killing me in that miniskirt
Skipping rocks on the river by the railroad tracks
You had a suntan line and red lipstick
I worked so hard for that first kiss
And a heart don't forget something like that

[Bridge]
Like an old photograph
Time can make a feeling fade
But the memory of a first love
Never fades away

[Chorus]
I had a barbecue stain on my white tee shirt
She was killing me in that miniskirt
Skipping rocks on the river by the railroad tracks
She had a sun tan line and red lipstick
I worked so hard for that first kiss
A heart don’t forget, no a heart don’t forget
I said a heart don’t forget something like that
Oh, not something like that

[Verse 1]
Here we are, of what is left
Of a husband and a wife
With four good kids who have a way
Of gettin' on with their lives
And I'm not old, but I'm getting
A whole lot older every day
It's too late to keep from going crazy
I've got to get away

[Chorus]
The reasons that I can't stay
Don't have a thing to do with bein' in love
I understand that loving a man
Shouldn't have to be this rough
And you ain't the only one who feels
Like this world's left you far behind
I don't know why you gotta be angry all the time

[Verse 2]
Our boys are strong now
The spitting image of you when you were young
I hope someday they can see past
What you have become
I remember every time I said I'd never leave
But what I can't live with is memories
Of the way you used to be

[Chorus]
The reasons that I can't stay
Don't have a thing to do with bein' in love
I understand that loving a man
Shouldn't have to be this rough
And you ain't the only one who feels
Like this world's left you far behind
I don't know why you gotta be angry all the time

[Verse 3]
Twenty years, have came and went
Since I walked out of your door
I never quite made it back
To the one I was before
And God it hurts me to think of you
For the light in your eyes was gone
Sometimes I don't know why
This old world can't leave well enough alone

[Chorus]
The reasons that I can't stay
Don't have a thing to do with bein' in love
I understand that loving a man
Shouldn't have to be this rough
And you ain't the only one who feels
Like this world's left you far behind
I don't know why you gotta be angry all the time
I don't know why you gotta be angry all the time
I don't know why you gotta be angry all the time

[Verse 1]
I don't want to be talking on the phone every night
Six PM, which timezone, yours or mine?
Ain't gonna worry where you are, who you're with
Let's just agree, this is it

[Chorus]
Portland, Maine, I don't know where that is
Leave your bags in the car, keep it running
I won't pretend, that I won't miss this
But Portland, Maine, I don't know where that is
And I don't want to know, I don't want to know

[Verse 2]
See I'm just saving us some trouble somewhere down the line
This kind of town you just leave behind
And you don't know it yet, but you won't come back
And I ain't going nowhere and you know that

[Chorus]
Portland, Maine, I don't know where that is
Leave your bags in the car, keep it running
I won't pretend, that I won't miss this
But Portland, Maine, I don't know where that is

[Bridge]
And you can go ahead and hate me, that's just fine
It doesn't matter either way, I'm right

[Chorus]
Portland, Maine, I don't know where that is
Leave your bags in the car, keep it running
I won't pretend, that I won't miss this
But Portland, Maine, I don't know where that is
Portland, Maine, I don't know where that is

[Outro]
I don't want to know
I don't want to know
I don't want to know
Portland, Maine
I don't know where that is

[Verse 1]
When all our tears have reached the sea
Part of you will live in me
Way down deep inside my heart
The days keep coming without fail
A new wind is going to find your sail
That's where your journey starts

[Chorus]
You'll find better love
Strong as it ever was
Deep as the river runs
Warm as the morning sun
Please remember me

[Verse 2]
Just like the waves down by the shore
We're going to keep on coming back for more
Cause we don't ever want to stop
Out in this brave new world you seek
Oh the valleys and the peaks
And I can see you on the top

[Chorus]
You'll find better love
Strong as it ever was
Deep as the river runs
Warm as the morning sun
Please remember me

[Verse 3]
Remember me when you're out walking
When the snow falls high outside your door
Late at night when you're not sleeping
And moonlight falls across your floor
When I can't hurt you anymore

[Chorus]
You'll find better love
Strong as it ever was
Deep as the river runs
Warm as the morning sun
Please remember me
Please remember me

[Verse 1]
Baby, go on and do what you gotta do
I’ll never be the man that you want me too
Just keep me somewhere in your young, wild memory
And whenever you finally get to
Wherever your heart leads

[Chorus]
I hope you find someone to love
And every dream that you dream of
I’m not the one you need and you know it
You’re gonna leave, so baby, get going
I won’t try to stop you anymore
Yeah, somewhere on the other side of that front door
I hope you find what you’re looking for

[Verse 2]
This has been coming down for a long, long time
I ain’t gonna change and I can’t change your mind
Just look back on me like a sun-soaked yesterday
And wherever your life leads you
Somewhere along the way

[Chorus]
I hope you find someone to love
And every dream that you dream of
I’m not the one you need and you know it
You’re gonna leave, so baby, get going
I won’t try to stop you anymore
Yeah, somewhere on the other side of that front door
I hope you find what you’re looking for

[Bridge]
I don’t wanna slow you down
Don’t wanna hold you down
You’re better off without me
I just wanna see you smile
Girl, I miss your smile
Wanna see you happy

[Chorus]
I hope you find someone to love
And every dream that you dream of
I’m not the one you need and you know it
You’re gonna leave, so baby, get going
I won’t try to stop you anymore
Yeah, somewhere on the other side of that front door
I hope you find what you’re looking for

[Outro]
Baby, go on and do what you gotta do
I’ll never be the man that you want me too

[Verse 1]
We were born in this little town
Growin' up I was countin' down
Every single day
Till we made our get-away
But you said you could never see yourself
Tryin' to make a life anywhere else
This would be your home
And I was on my own

[Pre-Chorus]
But ever since you said good-bye
I've been out here on the wind
Baby you would be surprised
All the places you have been
I've seen you in

[Chorus]
Albuquerque waitin' out a blizzard
Arizona dancin' 'cross the desert
Watchin' the sunset in Monterey
Girl I swear just the other day you were
Down in Georgia pickin' them peaches
In Carolina barefoot on the beaches
No matter where you choose to be
In my heart I'll always see you, everywhere

[Verse 2]
Now days, when I'm passin' through
The conversation always turns to you
And I hear you're doin' fine
Livin' out by the county line
Got a man that's home every night
A couple of kids and the kind of life
That you wanna lead
Guess you could say the same for me

[Pre-Chorus]
But you and I, made our choices
All those years ago
Still I know, I'll hear your voice
And see you down the road
Maybe in

[Chorus]
Oklahoma drivin' 'cross the prairie
In Dallas, Texas isn't that where we
Always said we would like to try
Never did so maybe that's why you're on
Every highway, just beyond the high-beams
Right beside me, in all of my sweet dreams
No matter where you choose to be
In my heart I'll always see you in...

[Chorus]
Albuquerque waitin' out a blizzard
In Arizona dancin' 'cross the desert
Watchin' the sunset in Monterey
Girl I swear just the other day you were
Down in Georgia pickin' them peaches
In Carolina barefoot on the beaches
No matter where you choose to be
In my heart I'll always see you, everywhere

[Verse 1]
I do not know why I act the way I do
Like I am not got a single thing to lose
Sometimes I am my own worst enemy
I guess that is just the cowboy in me

I got a life that most would love to have
But sometimes I still wake up fighting mad
At where this road I am heading down might lead
I guess that is just the cowboy in me

[Chorus]
The urge to run, the restlessness
The heart of stone I sometimes get
The things I've done for foolish pride
The me that is never satisfied
The face that is in the mirror when I do not like what I see
I guess that's just the cowboy in me

The urge to run, the restlessness
The heart of stone I sometimes get
The things I've done for foolish pride
The me that is never satisfied
The face that is in the mirror when I do not like what I see
I guess that's just the cowboy in me

[Verse 2]
Girl I know there is times you must have thought
There am not a line you have drawn I have not crossed
But you set your mind to see this love on through
I guess that is just the cowboy in you

[Outro]
We ride and never worry about the fall
I guess that's just the cowboy in us all

[Verse 1]
We used to chase that boy home from school
We called him freckled-face red-headed fool
He was different, he wasn't cool like me
Sticks and stones didn't break any bones
But we never left well enough alone
Then one day he ran away from home you see

[Pre-Chorus]
And I passed him as he walked away
And in his eyes I heard him say

[Chorus]
One of these days you're gonna love me
You'll sit down by yourself and think
About the times you pushed and shoved me
And what good friends we might have been
And then you're gonna sigh a little
And maybe even cry a little
But, one of these days
You're gonna love me

[Verse 2]
Patty Sue was a small town beauty
I took one look at her and had to pull her to me
Lord knows she should have seen right through me
When I promised her the world
But at 17 you only want one thing
I left her standin' with my high school ring
Innocent tears in a pourin' rain
As I walked away

[Pre-Chorus]
And I still see her in my dreams
And to this day she's whispering

[Chorus]
One of these days you're gonna love me
You'll sit down by yourself and think
About the time you turned from me
And what good friends we might have been
And then you're gonna sigh a little
And maybe even cry a little
But, one of these days
You're going to love me

[Bridge]
Now everybody stands up
The congregation sings
It's a song of sweet forgiveness
And as the chorus rings
The wind blows clear my memory
The pages start to turn
Then suddenly I'm singing
The moment that I learn

[Chorus]
One of these days I'm gonna love me
And feel the joy of sweet release
One of these days I'll rise above me
And at last I'll find some peace
And then I'm gonna smile a little
And maybe even laugh a little
But, one of these days
I'm gonna love me

[Verse 1]
I think I’ll take a moment, celebrate my age
The ending of an era and the turning of a page
Now it’s time to focus in on where I go from here
Lord have mercy on my next thirty years

[Verse 2]
Hey my next thirty years I’m going to have some fun
Try to forget about all the crazy things I’ve done
Maybe now I’ve conquered all my adolescent fears
And I’ll do it better in my next thirty years

[Verse 3]
My next thirty years I’m going to settle all the scores
Cry a little less, laugh a little more
Find a world of happiness without the hate and fear
Figure out just what I’m doing here
In my next thirty years

[Verse 4]
Oh my next thirty years, I’m going to watch my weight
Eat a few more salads and not stay up so late
Drink a little lemonade and not so many beers
Maybe I’ll remember my next thirty years

[Verse 5]
My next thirty years will be the best years of my life
Raise a little family and hang out with my wife
Spend precious moments with the ones that I hold dear
Make up for lost time here, in my next thirty years
In my next thirty years

[Verse 1]
Got Little Wayne pumping on my iPod
Thumping on the subs in the back of my crew cab
Redneck rocking like a rockstar
Sling a little mud off the back, we can do that
Friday night football, Saturday Last Call, Sunday Hallelujah
If you like it up loud and you're hillbilly proud
Then you know what I'm talking about

[Chorus]
Let me hear you say, Truck Yeah
Wanna get it jacked up yeah
Let's crank it on up yeah
With a little bit of luck I can find me a girl with a Truck Yeah
We can love it on up yeah
'Till the sun comes up yeah
And if you think this life I love is a little too country
Truck Yeah

[Verse 2]
Our party in the club is a honky tonk downtown
Yeah that's where I like to hang out
Chilling in the back room
Hanging with my whole crew
Sipping on a cold brew, hey now!
Got a mixed up playlist, DJ play this
Wanna hear a country song
If you like it up loud and you're hillbilly proud
Throw your hands up now, let me hear you shout

[Chorus]
Truck Yeah
Wanna get it jacked up yeah
Let's crank it on up yeah
With a little bit of luck I can find me a girl with a Truck Yeah
We can love it on up yeah
'Till the sun comes up yeah
And if you think this life I love is a little too country
Truck Yeah

[Verse 3]
Rap or country, city, farm
It don't matter who you are
Got a little fight, got a little love
Got a little redneck in your blood
Are you one of us?

[Chorus]
Let me hear you say, Truck Yeah
Wanna get it jacked up yeah
Let's crank it on up yeah
With a little bit of luck I can find me a girl with a Truck Yeah
We can love it on up yeah
'Till the sun comes up yeah
And if you think this life I love is a little too country
Truck Yeah

[Verse 1]
Dancin' when the stars go blue
Dancin' when the evening fell
Dancin' in your wooden shoes
In a wedding gown

[Verse 2]
Dancin' out on 7th street
Dancin' through the underground
Dancin' with the marionette
Are you happy now?

[Chorus]
Where do you go when you're lonely
Where do you go when you're blue
Where do you go when you're lonely
I'll follow you
When the stars go blue
Stars go blue
Stars go blue
Stars go blue

[Verse 3]
Laughin' with your pretty mouth
Laughin' with your broken eyes
Laughin' with your lover's tongue
In a lullaby

[Chorus]
Where do you go when you're lonely
Where do you go when you're blue
Where do you go when you're lonely
I'll follow you
When the stars go blue
Stars go blue
Stars go blue
Stars go blue

[Chorus]
She's my kind of rain
Like love in a drunken sky
She's confetti falling
Down all night

[Verse 1]
She sits quietly there
Black water in a jar
Says, Baby why are you
Trembling like you are

[Pre-Chorus]
So I wait
And I try
I confess like a child

[Chorus]
She's my kind of rain
Like love from a drunken sky
Confetti falling
Down all night
She's my kind of rain

[Verse 2]
She's the sun set shadows
She's like Rembrandt's light
She's the history that's made at night
She's my lost companion
She's my dreaming tree
Together in this brief eternity
Summer days, winter snows
She's all things to behold

[Chorus]
She's my kind of rain
Like love from a drunken sky
Confetti falling
Down all night
She's my kind of rain

[Pre-Chorus]
So I wait
And I try
I confess all my crimes

[Chorus]
She's my kind of rain
Like love from a drunken sky
Confetti falling
Down all night
She's my kind of rain
She's my kind of rain
Like love from a drunken sky
Confetti falling
Down all night
She's my kind of rain

[Outro]
She's my kind of rain
Oh, rain on me
She's my kind of rain

[Verse 1]
I'm going to clean the house
I'm going to fix the fence
In my final hours
I'm going to tie up these loose ends
I won’t leave a note
For anyone to find
Tomorrow they'll know
What I've done here tonight

[Chorus]
The drastic steps I'm taking
Are just an act of desperation
I knew no one would miss me
So what the hell
I fought and lied I drank too much
Hurt everyone I ever touched
Just how much I hurt you is hard to tell
This is not some kind of cry for help
Just good bye I wish you well
Because I love you
I'm going to kill myself

[Verse 2]
Now who is that
In my easy chair
Now wait a minute
That's the old me sitting there
And I thank God
The devil in me died
I stand before you now
A man changed and alive

[Chorus]
The drastic steps I'm taking
Are just an act of desperation
I knew no one would miss me
So what the hell
I fought and lied I drank too much
Hurt everyone I ever touched
Just how much I hurt you is hard to tell
This is not some kind of cry for help
Just good bye I wish you well
Because I love you
I have to kill myself

[Outro]
Going to clean the house
Going to fix that fence
In my final hours I'm going to tie up these loose ends

[Verse 1]
Every Friday night there's a steady cloud of dust
That leads back to a field filled with pickup trucks
Got old Hank crankin', way up loud
Got coolers in the back, tailgates down

[Pre-Chorus 1]
There's a big fire burnin' but don't be alarmed
It's just country boys and girls gettin' down on the farm

[Verse 2]
Ed's been on the tractor, ain't seen Becky all week
Somebody said they seen them headin' down to the creek
Farmer Johnson's daughters just pulled up in a jeep
Man, he knows how to grow 'em if you know what I mean

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Old Dave's gettin' loud but he don't mean no harm
We're just country boys and girls gettin' down on the farm

[Chorus]
You can have a lot of fun in a New York minute
But there's some things you can't do inside those city limits
Ain't no closin' time, ain't no cover charge
Just country boys and girls gettin' down on the farm

[Verse 3]
Well you can come as you are, there ain't no dress code
Just some rural route rules that you need to know
Don't mess with the bull, he can get real mean
Don't forget to shut the gate, stay out of the beans

[Pre-Chorus 3]
If it starts to rainin' we'll just head to the barn
We're country boys and girls gettin' down on the farm

[Chorus]
You can have a lot of fun in a New York minute
But there's some things you can't do inside those city limits
Ain't no closin' time, ain't no cover charge
Just country boys and girls gettin' down on the farm
Ain't no closin' time, ain't no cover charge
Just country boys and girls gettin' down on the farm

[Outro]
Oh, let's get down y'all
Stay out of that hay

[Verse 1]
I know how to hold a grudge
I can send a bridge up in smoke
And I can't count the people I've let down, the hearts I've broke
You ain't gotta dig too deep
If you wanna find some dirt on me
I'm learning who you've been
Ain't who you've got to be
It's gonna be an uphill climb
Aw honey I won't lie

[Chorus]
I ain't no angel
I still got a few more dances with the devil
I’m cleaning up my act little by little
I’m getting there
I can finally stand the man in the mirror I see
I ain’t as good as I’m gonna get
But I’m better than I used to be

[Verse 2]
I’ve pinned a lot of demons to the ground
I’ve got a few old habits left
But there’s still one or two I might need you to help me get
Standing in the rain so long has left me with a little rust
But put some faith in me
And someday you’ll see
There’s a diamond under all this dust

[Chorus]
I ain't no angel
I still got a few more dances with the devil
I’m cleaning up my act little by little
I’m getting there
I can finally stand the man in the mirror I see
I ain’t as good as I’m gonna get
But I’m better than I used to be

[Chorus]
I ain't no angel
I still got a few more dances with the devil
I’m cleaning up my act little by little
I’m getting there
I can finally stand the man in the mirror I see
I ain’t as good as I’m gonna get
But I’m better than I used to be

[Verse 1: Tim McGraw]
Horses are running wide open I just got to ride
To those honky-tonk bars that stay open way past closing time
Songs 'bout free thinking and drinking sure light my fire
That flame leaves a scar on my heart like an old branding iron

[Chorus: Tim McGraw, Both]
She said rodeo man where are you going
Don't you know that the life of a cowboy is no good alone
If you tear down that fence of rusty barbed wire
Then I'll lay down beside you and be your shotgun rider

[Verse 2: Tim McGraw, Both]
Yesterday's nothing but dust I brush off my boots
While I'm wearing out roads don't you know that I'm sure missing you
If I leave you'll be wondering when I'll be back again
Between Texas and ranchers and old friends where do you fit in

[Chorus: Tim McGraw, Both]
She said rodeo man where are you going
Don't you know that the life of a cowboy is no good alone
If you tear down that fence of rusty barbed wire
Then I'll lay down beside you and be your shotgun rider

[Interlude: Tim McGraw]
Come on

[Chorus: Both]
Hey rodeo man where are you going
Don't you know that the life of a cowboy is no good alone
If you tear down that fence of rusty barbed wire
Then I'll lay down beside you and be your shotgun rider

[Outro: Tim McGraw, Both]
Woman come lay down beside me and be my shotgun rider

[Verse 1]
I don’t know about you
But I never come into this bar
On a Thursday before 10 o’clock
But I thought what the hell, why not?

I don’t know about you
But I never walk up and talk to
A stranger but when I saw you
I had to, I just had to

[Pre-Chorus]
Girl, I know your favourite beer
'Cause you told me and I bought it
You can leave me sitting right here
But if you feel like talking

[Chorus]
What’s your name, what’s your sign, what’s your birthday?
What’s your wrist tattoo bible verse say?
Tell me this, do you kiss on the first date?
Don’t hold anything back (don’t hold anything back)

What’s your dream job?
Girl, where’s your hometown?
Yeah, what makes your world spin round and around?
And are you down to get out of here too?
Tell me everything till there’s nothing I don’t know about you

[Verse 2]
I don’t know about you
We can dip, we can slip out the back
Flee the scene, put your feet on my dash
Find a spot past the railroad tracks and never look back
But before that

[Chorus]
What’s your name, what’s your sign, what’s your birthday?
What’s your wrist tattoo bible verse say?
Tell me this, do you kiss on the first date?
Don’t hold anything back (don’t hold anything back)

What’s your dream job?
Girl, where’s your hometown?
Yeah, what makes your world spin around and around?
And are you down to get out of here too?
Tell me everything till there’s nothing I don’t know about you

[Bridge]
I know you like Bud Light
I know you got blue eyes
I know you got my heart beating in this bar
Tonight we can jump in, fall into something
And the perfect place to start is

[Chorus]
What’s your name, what’s your sign, what’s your birthday?
What’s your wrist tattoo bible verse say?
Tell me this, do you kiss on the first date?
Don’t hold anything back (don’t hold anything back)

What’s your dream job?
Girl, where’s your hometown?
Yeah, what makes your world spin around and around?
And are you down to get out of here too?
Tell me everything till there’s nothing I don’t know about you

[Outro]
Tell me everything, tell me everything
Tell me everything till there’s nothing I don’t know about you
Tell me everything, tell me everything
Tell me everything till there’s nothing I don’t know about you

[Verse 1: Chris Lane & Tori Kelly]
Duffle bag, backseat
My dash, your feet
Those other side of the highway headlights making you shine
My hand, your leg
Playlist playing
Even though I haven't made it yet
I'm dragging it, dropping it in my mind

[Chorus: Chris Lane & Tori Kelly]
You're a drive real slow, down a no lane road
To a house on a hill where the wild things grow
You wake up in pajamas, not a trace of makeup on ya
You're a help her fix it, having breakfast with my momma
You're a take back home, home, home girl
Home, home, home girl
Take back home, home, home girl
Home, home, home girl

[Verse 2: Tori Kelly & Chris Lane]
You're the kind I wanna take a ride with
Sit by on a Friday night
In the stadium lights, side by side
All the ladies like, "Yeah, she's doing just fine"
Everybody in the bleachers, they all gon' want to meet ya
From my teachers to my preacher
My little crowd pleaser
Parading with you feeling homecoming cool, yeah

[Chorus: Chris Lane & Tori Kelly]
I wanna drive real slow, down a no lane road
To a house on a hill where the wild things grow
You wake up in pajamas, not a trace of makeup on ya
You're a help her fix it, having breakfast with my momma
You're a take back home, home, home girl
Home, home, home girl
Take back home, home, home girl
Home, home, home girl

[Post-Chorus: Chris Lane & Tori Kelly]
You're a take back, you're a take back
You're a take back home girl
You're a take back home
You're a take back home girl

[Bridge: Chris Lane]
You got that down-home, homegrown, found on good ground soul
That down-home, homegrown, found on good ground soul

[Chorus: Chris Lane & Tori Kelly]
You're a drive real slow, down a no lane road
To a house on a hill where the wild things grow
You wake up in pajamas, not a trace of makeup on ya
You're a help her fix it, having breakfast with my momma
You're a take back home, home, home girl
Home, home, home girl
Take back home, home, home girl
Home, home, home girl

[Post-Chorus: Chris Lane & Tori Kelly]
You're a take back, you're a take back
You're a take back home girl
You're a take back home, yeah
You're a take back home girl
You're a take back home

[Verse 1]
Just look at her sittin' there
Sweatpants, t-shirt, in her comfy chair, hmm
Her hair in a bun, one hand on a mug
And the other one’s playin' snare
To a George Strait vinyl, that yes-or-no line will get her close
But I don't think she can understand
Just how far I’ve been lettin' my heart fall
But what's in my head

[Chorus]
She don't know I got some big, big plans
Build a little house out on some hand-me-down land
Find a little island where we go to get tan
I bet we take our kids down there one day
And I know she wouldn't mind if I
Did a little somethin' like find a flight
Overnight to paradise and leave tonight
And I'ma put a diamond on her hand

[Post-Chorus]
She don't know I got some big, big plans
Well, she don’t know, well, she don’t know
She don't know I got some big, big plans
Well, she don’t know, well, she don't know

[Verse 2]
Well, she don't know I already bought a ring
Hid it in the bottom left drawer, right beside the sink
A shiny emerald diamond on a brand-new band
Asked her mama for permission and her daddy for her hand

[Chorus]
I got some big, big plans
Build a little house out on some hand-me-down land
Find a little island where we go to get tan
I bet we take our kids down there one day
And I know she wouldn't mind if I
Did a little somethin’ like find a flight
Overnight to paradise and leave tonight
And I'ma put a diamond on her hand

[Post-Chorus]
She don't know I got some big, big plans
Well, she don't know, well, she don't know
She don't know I got some big, big plans
Well, she don't know, well, she don't know

[Bridge]
Well, here I go
'Cause right now, we're back in her hometown
And I'm down on one knee
I guess she finally figured out
I'm gonna ask her to marry me

[Chorus]
I got some big, big plans
Build a little house out on some hand-me-down land
Find a little island where we go to get tan
I bet we take our kids down there one day
And I know she wouldn't mind if I
Did a little somethin' like find a flight
Overnight to paradise and leave tonight
And I'ma put a diamond on her hand

[Post-Chorus]
She don't know I got some big, big plans
Well, she don't know, well, she don't know
She don't know I got some big, big plans
Well, she don't know, well, she don't know

[Verse 1]
She got a smile that makes your worst day
Feel like it's your birthday
She's got a laugh like confetti
Would change her name if she'd let me

[Pre-Chorus 1]
She's got a way of changing the game
The way that you play, it's never the same

[Chorus]
She's the kind that makes you wanna
Ride around, windows down
Yell with the radio
She's the kind that makes you wanna
Drop your plans, drop a grand
Hell where the money goes
She make you wanna fight for her
She make you wanna die for her, yeah
She make you wanna fall
Make you want it all, make you wanna call
She make you wanna die for her

[Verse 2]
The way that she moves
Is like a soft glow, flicker of a candle
She turns my cool into disaster
Heart is pumping faster

[Pre-Chorus 2]
She's head to toe, body and soul
So beautiful, she don't even know

[Chorus]
She's the kind that makes you wanna
Ride around, windows down
Yell with the radio
She's the kind that makes you wanna
Drop your plans, drop a grand
Hell where the money goes
She make you wanna fight for her
She make you wanna die for her, yeah
She make you wanna fall
Make you want it all, make you wanna call

[Post-Chorus]
She make you wanna die for her
Yeah-eh, yeah
Yeah-eh, yeah
Yeah-eh, yeah
She make you wanna die for her
Yeah-eh, yeah
Yeah-eh, yeah
Yeah-eh, yeah

[Bridge]
For her, I would walk a straight line
Wear out the soles in my shoes
For her, I would run through the night
Just to kiss her one more time
If she wanted me to

[Chorus]
She's the kind that makes you wanna
Ride around, windows down
Yell with the radio
She's the kind that makes you wanna
Drop your plans, drop a grand
Hell where the money goes
She make you wanna fight for her
She make you wanna die for her, yeah
She make you wanna fall
Make you want it all, make you wanna call

[Post-Chorus]
She make you wanna die for her
Yeah-eh, yeah
Yeah-eh, yeah
Yeah-eh, yeah
She make you wanna die for her
Yeah-eh, yeah
Yeah-eh, yeah
Yeah-eh, yeah

[Verse 1]
It ain't a secret you've been stealing my attention
So tell me every little secret I don't already know
Sometimes it feels like I don't know enough about you, but I want to
You make me want to

[Pre-Chorus]
Get emotional
Make it personal
Tell me everything you ever wanted me to know

[Chorus]
Every up, every down, every side of you
All of the good, all of the bad, all of the hurting you've been through
Anything and everything you ever dreamed your whole life
Cause girl I just know I wanna know all about you
Cause I'm all about you

[Verse 2]
I wanna know how much your daddy loved your mama
You're what it means to keep a promise when you're sayin' "I do"
I ain't tryna get ahead of myself, but I want to
You make want to

[Pre-Chorus]
Get emotional
Make it personal
Tell me everything you ever wanted me to know

Every up, every down, every side of you
All of the good, all of the bad, all of the hurting you've been through
Anything and everything you ever dreamed your whole life
Cause girl I just know I wanna know all about you
Cause I'm all about you

[Bridge]
It ain't a secret you've been stealing my attention
So tell me every little secret I don't already know
Sometimes it feels like I don't know enough about you, but I want to
You make me want to

[Chorus]
Every up, every down, every side of you
All of the good, all of the bad, all of the hurting you've been through
Anything and everything you ever dreamed your whole life
Cause girl I just know I wanna know all about you
Cause I'm all about you

[Outro]
(I wouldn't want it any other way)
Cause I'm all about you
(I just wanna love you everyday)
I wanna know all about you
(I wouldn't want it any other way)
Cause I'm all about you
(I just wanna love you everyday, everyday)

[Verse 1]
Hey girl, you know what you been missing?
Me, me, yeah
Hey girl, whoever you been kissing
It ain't me, me
I got that love medicinal
I'll make you feel invincible
I'm more than recreational
I'm what you need

[Chorus]
I'll be your smooth ride, that late night, your Walter White high
I'll be your first time, that so right
Get you falling in love at the end of the night
With that good ish, that long trip, that sugar on your lips
That favorite habit, gotta have it, you can't quit

[Post-Chorus]
I'll be the high that never lets you down (I got your fix)
The one you crave when no one is around (I got your fix)

[Verse 1 ]
Baby I just don't get it
Do you enjoy being hurt?
I know you smelled the perfume
The make-up on his shirt
You don't believe his stories
You know that they're all lies
Bad as you are, you stick around
And I just don't know why

[Pre-Chorus]
If I was your man, baby you'd
Never worry about what I do
I'd be coming home back to you
Every night, doing you right
You're the type of woman deserves good things
A fistful of diamonds, a hand full of rings
Baby you're a star, I just want to show you are

[Chorus]
You should let me love you
Let me be the one to
Give you everything you want and need
Baby, good love and protection
Make me your selection
Show you how true love's supposed to be
Baby, you should let me love you
Love you, love you, love you
Yeah, Listen

[Verse 2]
Your true beauty’s description
Look so good that it hurts
You're a dime plus 99
And it's a shame, don't even know what you're worth
Everywhere you go, they stop and stare
Cause you're bad and it shows
From your head to your toes
Out of control, baby you know

[Pre-Chorus]
If I was your man, baby you'd
Never worry about what I do
I'd be coming home back to you
Every night, doing you right
You're the type of woman deserves good things
A fistful of diamonds, a hand full of rings
Baby you're a star, I just want to show you are

[Chorus]
You should let me love you
Let me be the one to
Give you everything you want and need
Baby, good love and protection
Make me your selection
Show you how true love's supposed to be
Baby, you should let me love you
Love you, love you, love you
Yeah, Listen

[Pre-Chorus]
If I was your man, baby you'd
Never worry about what I do
I'd be coming home back to you
Every night, doing you right
You're the type of woman deserves good things
A fistful of diamonds, a hand full of rings
Baby you're a star, I just want to show you are

[Chorus]
You should let me love you
Let me be the one to
Give you everything you want and need
Baby, good love and protection
Make me your selection
Show you how true love's supposed to be
Baby, you should let me love you
Love you, love you, love you, yeah
Baby, you should let me love you
Love you, love you, love you, yeah
Baby, you should let me love you

[Verse 1]
Don't say a word, or I'll be gone
You broke me down for so long
I been going over the things I could have done
But you never loved me enough

[Pre-Chorus]
Cause all I know is that letting you pull my strings is getting old, so old
I played your part, but it's time you said

[Chorus]
Maybe if you get your act together
Maybe if you love me just a little bit better
Well maybe there was nothing I could do at all
You said, maybe if we spent some time apart
Picking up the pieces of a broken heart
But maybe there was nothing I could do at all, all

[Verse 2]
I stumbled home through the night
And as you slipped into my mind, mmm
We tried for so long, but you set the stage for the fall
My heart needs to learn that you're gone

[Pre-Chorus]
Cause all I know is that letting you pull my strings is getting old, so old
I'm putting these ghosts to rest, so don't say

[Chorus]
Maybe if you get your act together
Maybe if you love me just a little bit better
Well maybe there was nothing I could do at all
You said, maybe if we spent some time apart
Picking up the pieces of a broken heart
But maybe there was nothing I could do at all, all

[Pre-Chorus]
And all I know is that letting you pull my strings is getting old, so old
And I don't wanna hear you say that

[Chorus]
Maybe if you get your act together
Maybe if you love me just a little bit better
Well maybe there was nothing I could do at all
You said, maybe if we spent some time apart
Picking up the pieces of a broken heart
But maybe there was nothing I could do at all, all

[Verse 1]
It hurts so bad to watch you leave
We packed your stuff, and I set you free
Baby don't turn around
You don't want to see another tear fall down
Just keep heading towards anything that ain't me
We laid our hearts out on the table
Mine wants you to stay, yours isn't able

[Chorus]
I hope you find just what you're looking for
I see in your eyes, you ain't got that fire no more
So go on and run, see what there is to see
But I hope when you're done, you'll run, you'll run straight back to me

[Post-Chorus]
Back to me, back to me, back to me
Back to me, back to me, back to me

[Verse 2]
Every time I close my eyes, I see your face behind those headlights
Pulling back into that driveway
Hearing everything I wanna hear you say
Like, "I love you", "I need you", "I missed you"

[Chorus]
I hope you find just what you're looking for
I see in your eyes, you ain't got that fire no more
So go on and run, see what there is to see
But I hope when you're done, you'll run, you'll run straight back to me

[Post-Chorus]
Back to me, back to me, back to me
Back to me, back to me, back to me

[Bridge]
Yeah, back to me, back to these arms of mine
Patiently waiting for you
This door is always gonna be open for you
Back to me, back to us

[Chorus]
Yeah, I hope you find just what you're looking for
I see in your eyes, you ain't got that fire no more
So go on and run, see what there is to see
But I hope when you're done, you'll run, you'll run straight back to me

[Post-Chorus]
Back to me, back to me, back to me
Back to me, back to me, back to me
Back to me, back to me, back to me
Back to me, back to me, back to me

[Chorus]
I hope you find just what you're looking for
I see in your eyes, you ain't got that fire no more
So go on and run, see what there is to see
But I hope when you're done, you'll run, you'll run straight back to me

[Post-Chorus]
(Back to me, back to me, back to me)
(Back to me, back to me, back to me)
(Back to me, back to me, back to me)
(Back to me, back to me, back to me)

[Verse 1]
Her and her friends piled into a Camry
Headed downtown, got in for free
She's all dolled up, looking VIP
Walked in, found a booth, took a seat
Wiped the tear from the corner of her eye
Faked a smile to the Corona guy
Usually she wouldn't give him the time of day
But hey, in here tonight

[Pre-Chorus]
She don't wanna feel nothing real
She just want somebody to give her attention
For a minute, call her beautiful
She ain't trying to wind up in love
She's just trying to burn some time up
On a Friday night in the neon light
Yeah, he hurt her soul

[Chorus]
She just needs a hero to save her
From being all alone
From paying for a drink she don't want
Nothing more than a dance or two
She's feeling blue
But she just needs a hero, mmm
And she just needs a hero

[Verse 2]
He's all geared up for his football game
He's wearing his jersey with the same last name
A still reminder of the guy that ain't around these days
And his mama's up in them aluminum stands
Saying 'run, baby run', she's his number one fan
Doing the best she can
But wondering why his daddy can't be a better man

[Pre-Chorus]
He just wants to feel what kids feel
Walking off the football field
After winning, for a minute
In his daddy's pads
The kid should never have to wonder
If his old man even loves him
On a Friday night under Friday lights
Shouldn't be so sad

[Chorus]
That should be his hero
That left him and his mama all alone
Barely even calls him on the phone
Every year in March, sends a birthday card
But he just needs a hero, mmm
Yeah, he just needs a hero

[Verse 3]
There's an old white haired preacher man
With a leather bind good book on the stand
Says 'if you're ready for a change, here's your chance
With every head bow, slip up your hand'

[Bridge]
If you wanna feel something real
That this mean old world can't kill
Not even Satan
There's a saviour, he'll wash away your sins
All you gotta do is reap in
Open up your heart, accept him and
He'll save your soul

[Chorus]
Jesus is a hero, ooo
And everybody needs a hero
Jesus is a hero, ooo
And everybody needs a hero

[Verse 1]
Ball-cap to the flip-flop
A toe ring to the tip-top
From Haggard to the hip-hop
She can play either side of a bad cop good cop
From her sundress to her Sunday best
Cover Girl top or just a hot mess
Oh my my, yeah she's the girl that got my heart beating outta my chest

[Chorus]
She's a blue-jean, rope swing, supermodel
Like a stain-glass made from a broken bottle
Make you promise you won't when she knows you gotta
Yeah, she's her own kind of beautiful
She's a Roman candle, she's a tent revival
She's a needle dancing on classic vinyl
She's a sunset wish with a can't miss smile
Her own kind of beautiful
Beautiful

[Verse 2]
A hello, yeah just clicked
So she, settled in for a slow sip
And when we leave in a little bit
All the other guys, will be so pissed

[Chorus]
She's a blue-jean, rope swing, supermodel
Like a stain-glass made from a broken bottle
Make you promise you won't when she knows you gotta
Yeah, she's her own kind of beautiful
She's a Roman candle, she's a tent revival
She's a needle dancing on classic vinyl
She's a sunset wish with a can't miss smile
Her own kind of beautiful
Beautiful
You're beautiful

[Bridge]
From her sundress to her Sunday best
That Maybelline red lip gloss kiss
Oh my my, yeah she's the girl that got my heart beating outta my chest

[Chorus]
She's a blue-jean, rope swing, supermodel
Like a stain-glass made from a broken bottle
Make you promise you won't when she knows you gotta
Yeah, she's her own kind of beautiful
She's a Roman candle, she's a tent revival
She's a needle dancing on classic vinyl
She's a sunset wish with a can't miss smile
Her own kind of beautiful
(Ball-cap to the flip-flop)
Beautiful
(A toe ring to the tip-top)
You're beautiful
(From Haggard to the hip-hop)
Yeah, her own kind of beautiful
She's a Roman candle, she's a tent revival
She's a needle dancing on classic vinyl
She's a sunset wish with a can't miss smile
She's her own kind of beautiful

[Verse 1: Chris Lane]
Standing here, drink it in
Everything you been pouring
Like the way it goes down
And I like the taste on your tongue
I'm gonna let you hold me
Even if it's just for now

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Lane]
I know where it's gonna go
You're so predictable

[Chorus: Chris Lane]
You always love me in circles
You hurt me on purpose to come around again, come around again
You're so determined to break me
To say that you saved me
You come around again, come around again

[Post-Chorus: MacKenzie Porter]
I'm so mad about you
I can't live without you
I love you, I need you
Swear I'll never leave you

[Verse 2: MacKenzie Porter]
Lying here, next to you
I've never felt so perfect
Even if it's just for now
With paper hearts and kerosene
One word can spark a fire
You build it up and burn it down

[Pre-Chorus: MacKenzie Porter]
Love has its rituals
We're so predictable

[Chorus: Both]
You always love me in circles
You hurt me on purpose to come around again, come around again
You're so determined to break me
To say that you saved me
You come around again, come around again

[Post-Chorus: Both]
I'm so mad about you
I can't live without you
I love you, I need you
I swear I'll never leave you
I'm so mad about you
I can't live without you
I love you, I need you
I swear I'll never leave you

[Pre-Chorus: MacKenzie Porter]
Love has its rituals
We're so predictable

[Chorus: Both]
You always love me in circles
You hurt me on purpose to come around again, come around again
You're so determined to break me
To say that you saved me
You come around again, come around again

[Post-Chorus: Both]
I'm so mad about you
I can't live without you
I love you, I need you
I swear I'll never leave you
I'm so mad about you
I can't live without you
I love you, I need you
I swear I'll never leave you

[Verse 1]
Girl let me throw this out there
I want to take you out where
We can get a little fresh air
Pop a top, share a spot
On a lawn chair
Honeysuckle in your long hair
Girl I swear I can hear them crickets cricking
While them lines are getting twisted
And the sun is slowly sinking like a bobber tonight

[Chorus]
And when they ask us where we're heading
We'll say somewhere where they're biting
Little secret spot hiding
When them lighting bugs are bugging
Catch a buzz and catch a feeling
Just reeling you in
Stealing kisses, just go missing
When they ask where we've been
We'll call it fishin'
We'll call it fishin'

[Verse 2]
Get a little off the radar
Break out my old guitar
Popcorn in a mason jar
I take a sip, make a wish
On a shooting star
Girl you got me hooked, lined, and sinking

[Chorus]
And when they ask us where we're heading
We'll say somewhere where they're biting
Little secret spot hiding
When them lighting bugs are bugging
Catch a buzz and catch a feeling
Just reeling you in
Stealing kisses, just go missing
When they ask where we've been
We'll call it fishin'
We'll call it fishin'

[Bridge]
Watch your pretty little painted up toes
Disappear in the water
Baby don't you love it out here
Let's stay a little longer
A little longer
Baby we'll be goners

[Chorus]
And when they ask us where we're heading
We'll say somewhere where they're biting
Little secret spot hiding
When them lighting bugs are bugging
Catch a buzz and catch a feeling
Just reeling you in
Stealing kisses, just go missing
When they ask where we've been
We'll call it fishin'
Yeah, yeah
We'll call it fishin'
Yeah, We'll call it fishin'
Yeah, yeah
We'll call it fishin'

[Verse 1]
She's wrapped in a blanket
Sunday morning
Hurting and working on a Pedialyte
Missed the church bell
Asking herself, "Girl what the hell you do last night?"
It was one text left to her ex's bed and clothes all over the place
She was summa cum laude, but at 1 am that wasn't the case

[Chorus]
Drunk people do dumb things
They pick it up when the phone rings
Saying things that they don't mean
Like I want you back, the key's under the mat
Yeah, they forget about the heartbreak
Never thinking about the next day, til its too late
You can't take it back now
But it's ok, don't let it get you down
Drunk people do dumb things

[Verse 2]
He's standing in the shower thinking about her
Considering drinking a bounce back beer
Saying why did I get drunk?
Mad 'cuz he slipped up, because getting over her took all last year
Now he's all torn up wishing she'd come back
He thought he was smarter than that but

[Chorus]
Drunk people do dumb things
They pick it up when the phone rings
Saying things that they don't mean
Like I want you back, the key's under the mat
Yeah, they forget about the heartbreak
Never thinking about the next day, til its too late
You can't take it back now
But it's ok, don't let it get you down
Drunk people do dumb things

[Bridge]
Oh, drunk people do dumb things
Hey you up?
Yeah, what's up?
It's been a while, I miss you
I miss you too
Semi colon smile
What you doing right now, can I come meet you?
Drop me a pin, be there in ten

[Chorus]
Drunk people do dumb things
They pick it up when the phone rings
Saying things that they don't mean
Like I want you back, the key's under the mat
Yeah, they forget about the heartbreak
Never thinking about the next day, til its too late
You can't take it back now
But it's ok, don't let it get you down
Drunk people do dumb things
Oh, drunk people do dumb things

[Verse 1]
Girl problems: yeah, they're bad and I've had my fair share from back in the day
Girl problems: some drama, some wanting a diamond after just one day
You saw me coming
All hours of stalking and watching my every move
Girl problems: I've dealt with some crazy, but baby, that was all before you

[Chorus]
'Cause now I'm up too late at night
You're turning on everything but the light
Gotta go work, but I don't wanna go
Which part of you do I love best?
How do I keep kissing you and catch my breath?
Yeah, now with you, I got a whole new set
New set of girl problems

[Post-Chorus]
(I got girl problems, but the problem is, I can't find one problem with you)
Girl problems
(I got girl problems, but the problem is, I can't find one problem with you)

[Verse 2]
Girl problems: you know since I met you I can't think of anything else
Girl problems: do I take you downtown or keep you here all to myself?
I'm spending all my money, my time, every minute and dime I got
Girl problems: I'm in love with you baby and I don't ever wanna stop

[Chorus]
'Cause now I'm up too late at night
You're turning on everything but the light
Gotta go work, but I don't wanna go
Which part of you do I love best?
How do I keep kissing you and catch my breath?
Yeah, now with you, I got a whole new set
New set of girl problems

[Post-Chorus]
(I got girl problems, but the problem is, I can't find one problem with you)
Girl problems
(I got girl problems, but the problem is, I can't find one problem with you)

[Bridge]
My kind of girl problems
And I don't wanna ever solve them
Yeah, I'm just glad I got 'em
Oh, I don't ever wanna let you go, no

[Chorus]
'Cause now I'm up too late at night
You're turning on everything but the light
Gotta go work, but I don't wanna go
Which part of you do I love best?
How do I keep kissing you and catch my breath?
Yeah, now with you, I got a whole new set
New set of girl problems

[Outro]
(I got girl problems, but the problem is, I can't find one problem with you)
Girl problems
(I got girl problems, but the problem is, I can't find one problem with you)
Girl problems
(I got girl problems, but the problem is, I can't find one problem with you)
Girl problems
(I got girl problems, but the problem is, I can't find one problem with you)

[Verse 1]
Just when I got my groove on
I got my smooth on
I finally moved on from you, girl
I was on a rebound rocket
Then I felt a little buzzing in my pocket
Guess who?
I shoulda known it was you
I guess you already dropped your new somebody new
And you've had one or two and I'm back on your list
Well, all I gotta say is 'new phone, who's this?'

[Chorus]
Yeah, you kicked me to the curb
You took my favourite shirt
Now you've got the nerve, girl
To blow me up like I'm 911
With the 'Where you at? What you doing? What's up?', yeah
Girl, you're kidding me, you're killing me
You're messing up my buzz
'Cause you keep texting that you're missing what we was
You want my love, you want my kiss
All I gotta say is 'new phone, who's this?'

[Verse 2]
Bet you thought I'd hit you back
With 'girl, I miss you bad'
Well, too bad
Hey, I don't want what we had
When I got what I got
She's so dang hot
Dot, dot, dot

[Chorus]
Yeah, you kicked me to the curb
You took my favourite shirt
Now you've got the nerve, girl
To blow me up like I'm 911
With the 'Where you at? What you doing? What's up?', yeah
Girl, you're kidding me, you're killing me
You're messing up my buzz
'Cause you keep texting that you're missing what we was
You want my love, you want my kiss
All I gotta say is 'new phone, who's this?'

[Interlude]

[Pre-Chorus]
Just when I got my groove on
I got my smooth on
I finally moved on

[Chorus]
Yeah, you kicked me to the curb
You took my favourite shirt
Now you've got the nerve, girl
To blow me up like I'm 911
With the 'Where you at? What you doing? What's up?', yeah
Girl, you're kidding me, you're killing me
You're messing up my buzz
'Cause you keep texting that you're missing what we was
You want my love, you want my kiss
All I gotta say is 'new phone, who's this?'

[Outro]
Who this?
I don't recognise this number
Delete

[Verse 1]
Look at us waking up in last night's clothes
Smelling like last night's smoke
Laughing at last night's jokes
Man, last night was dope
Went from flirting right back to burning
It feels real good learning

[Chorus]
Nothing lights like an old flame
Kisses sparking like butane
One look strikes a match
One match kicks us back just like that
The fire alarm's buzzin' and the firetrucks are comin' like
(Ooh ooh) baby in the pouring rain
(Ooh ooh) middle of a hurricane
Can't stop, we tried, it's too hot
Too high, you and I last night
Nothing lights like an old flame
(Nothing lights, nothing lights like an old flame)
(Nothing lights, nothing lights like an old flame)

[Verse 2]
The off is all the way back to ten
We ain't gotta tell our friends
Thanks to that salty rim
Back in that groove again
Shouldn't be surprising
They could see the smoke signals rising

[Chorus]
Nothing lights like an old flame
Kisses sparking like butane
One look strikes a match
One match kicks us back just like that
The fire alarm's buzzin' and the firetrucks are comin' like
(Ooh ooh) baby in the pouring rain
(Ooh ooh) middle of a hurricane
Can't stop, we tried, it's too hot
Too high, you and I last night
Nothing lights like an old flame
(Nothing lights, nothing lights like an old flame)
(Nothing lights, nothing lights like an old flame)

[Bridge]
Yeah, it all started with tequila on your lips
Yeah, it ends up with you and me like this

[Chorus]
Nothing lights like an old flame
Kisses sparking like butane
One look strikes a match
One match kicks us back just like that
The fire alarm's buzzin' and the firetrucks are comin' like
(Ooh ooh) baby in the pouring rain
(Ooh ooh) middle of a hurricane
Can't stop, we tried, it's too hot
Too high, you and I last night
Nothing lights like an old flame
(Nothing lights, nothing lights like an old flame)
(Nothing lights, nothing lights like an old flame)

[Verse 1]
Sun's settin' on the water now
Somehow you keep on gettin' hotter now
And I'm down with anyting that you down for
And I think you should know
You ain't ever gotta doubt it, babe
You already know that I'm about it, babe
Ain't ever goin' nowhere without you, lady
Don't be crazy

[Chorus]
You already got my loving
And I ain't gonna stop for nothing, no
Gonna love each other 'til the sun goes down
And comes up again
While we're goin' 'round in circles
Let the ray turn purple
We'll be dancin', holdin', kissin', lovin'
Havin' ourselves some soaking wet fun
Don't you know we never be done
Taking laps around the sun?

[Verse 2]
I remember our fist date at the State Fair
I threw a ball and broke some bottles won a teddy bear
I took a break from cutting grass at the family business
To pick you up and meet you
Daddy said "No funny business"
When the pages kept turning in a little summer flame we made
The day just keeps on burning and I might just put a ring on it
Just to let you know that I, I love you like crazy

[Chorus]
You already got my loving
And I ain't gonna stop for nothing, no
Gonna love each other 'til the sun goes down
And comes up again
While we're goin' 'round in circles
Let the ray turn purple
We'll be dancin', holdin', kissin', lovin'
Havin' ourselves some soaking wet fun
Don't you know we never be done
Taking laps around the sun?

[Bridge]
While we're up here you should just follow me
In our own little world, girl, that's gotta be
You make loving you so easy
You make loving you so fun
While we're up here you should just follow me
In our own little world, girl, that's gotta be
You make loving you so easy
You make me crazy

[Chorus]
You already got my loving
And I ain't gonna stop for nothing, no
Gonna love each other 'til the sun goes down
And comes up again
While we're goin' 'round in circles
Let the ray turn purple
We'll be dancin', holdin', kissin', lovin'
Havin' ourselves some soaking wet fun
Don't you know we never be done
Taking laps around the sun?

[Outro]
(You got to know, you need to know)
You got your lovin'
(You got to know, you need to know)
You got your fearless
(You got to know, you need to know)
(You got to know)
Taking laps around the sun
(You got to know, you need to know lovin')
Laps around the sun
(You got to know, you need to know lovin')
(You got to know, you need to know)
(You got to know)
You already got my loving

[Verse 1]
Five hundred horses outside at the valet
I got the keys, if you want, we can leave here tonight
24/7, your body's on my brain
But it don't mean ish if somebody else is on your mind

[Pre-Chorus]
Cause I know, yeah I know, yeah I know, and I'm touchin' on you
That you know, yeah you know, yeah you know what you're getting into
I don't care what he does cause he's only wasting his time
And I know what you like, what you like

[Chorus]
Who's it gonna be?
Baby is it him or me?
We can fix this easily
If you just follow me home now
Who's it gonna be?
Cause you know he can't compete
I'm the only one you need
You should probably let him know now
Who's it gonna be?

[Post-Chorus]
(Who)
(Gonna be, gonna be)
(Who)

[Verse 2]
It's paradise when I'm touching your body
Put my hands on your waist
We can keep making ways on if you want
You should be mine
Cause you just ain't anybody
Take it or leave, but I'll never leave you alone

[Chorus]
So who's it gonna be?
Baby is it him or me?
We can fix this easily
If you just follow me home now
Who's it gonna be?
Cause you know he can't compete
I'm the only one you need
You should probably let him know now
Who's it gonna be?

[Post-Chorus]
(Who)

[Verse 1]
Some guys need a side piece
Some slide in the DM on the weekend
Some keep a couple on the line
Anytime they want another bed to sleep in
Girl, believe it

[Verse 2]
Oh, but me
I'm just a simple man
I'm just a dinner-for-two, true gentleman
Yes ma'am
I, I ain't no numbers man
Ain't trying to rack 'em up
Count 'em up on both hands

[Chorus]
All I need is one girl, one girl
A fun girl, can't wait to come undone girl
Hotter than the sun girl, one girl
Second to none girl
No one else does what you do to me
I'm looking at you like you could be the one girl, one girl
All I need is one girl, one girl

[Verse 3]
To take a drive on the highway
Catch a sunset or a sunrise, whatever you like
Maybe stay in bed all day
Yeah I know it's a king size
But there's only room for one girl
You're the one girl, one girl

[Chorus]
All I need is one girl, one girl
A fun girl, can't wait to come undone girl
Hotter than the sun girl, one girl
Second to none girl
No one else does what you do to me
I'm looking at you like you could be the one girl, one girl
All I need is one girl, one girl

[Bridge]
Yeah that's the thing about you and me, you and me
We fit together like a lock and key, perfectly, certainly
I'm thinking that eternity is there in the cards
It's written with a Sharpie baby up in them stars
Yeah all I need is one girl
Yeah all I need is one girl

[Chorus]
All I need is one girl, one girl
A fun girl, can't wait to come undone girl
Put you on rerun girl, one girl
Second to none girl
No one else does what you do to me
I'm looking at you like you could be the one girl, one girl
All I need is one girl, one girl

[Outro]
All I need is one girl, one girl

[Verse 1]
She only wants me on the weekend
Why do I want it all the time?
I even see you when I'm sleeping
The only thing that's on my mind

[Pre-Chorus]
I've been spending my money and spending on mind
I been cool with your friends; I remembered your sign
But she only wants me on the weekend
And why do I want it...

[Chorus]
Why do I want it all the time?
Why do I want it all the time?
If I said I didn't, I'd be lying
You know I want it all the, you know I want it all the time

[Post-Chorus]
When you're shaking that, shake it all over baby
You got a mean, bad body, got to celebrate it

[Verse 2]
I give my love and she just takes it
No, she don't even need to ask
Don't give it back, she don't replace it
Looking at that, I can't be mad

[Pre-Chorus]
I've been spending my money and spending on mind
I been cool with your friends; I remembered your sign
But she only wants me on the weekend
And why do I want it...

[Chorus]
Why do I want it all the time?
Why do I want it all the time?
If I said I didn't, I'd be lying
You know I want it all the, you know I want it all the time

[Post-Chorus]
Shaking that, shake it all over baby
Got a mean, bad body, got to celebrate it
Don't know what I love, but you're gonna make it
You know I want it all the time

[Bridge]
Ooh, oh oh
She only wants me on the weekend
I give what she wants all the time
She always leaves me when I'm sleeping
Why do I want it...

[Chorus]
Why do I want it all the time?
Why do I want it all the time?
If I said I didn't, I'd be lying
She knows I want it all the, she knows I want it all the time

[Post-Chorus]
(She knows, she knows, she knows)
Shaking that, shake it all over baby
Got a mean, bad body, got to celebrate it
Don't know what I love, but you're gonna make it
You know I want it all the time

[Verse 1: Chris Lane]
Every record's got two sides
Left's got right, down's got high
Truth's got lies
And I got you, yeah
Every Monday's got Tuesdays
Gas got breaks, love's got hate
Cali's got wine
And my world just wouldn't be right

[Chorus: Chris Lane & Danielle Bradbery]
Without your booty in my shotgun seat
Without your kisses rolling off my cheek
Yeah, ooo ooo, I can't do life without
Without your cool wind underneath my wings
Without you singing my harmonies
Yeah, ooo ooo, I can't do life without you, you
Without you, yeah
Without you, yeah

[Verse 2: Chris Lane & Danielle Bradbery]
It takes two to tango
Tear up Durango
Angel's got halos
Suns always spinning round the moon
Yeah, the night's got the morning
You got the gorgeous
Blue's got your eyes
And my world wouldn't be right

[Chorus: Chris Lane & Danielle Bradbery]
Without your booty in my shotgun seat
Without your kisses rolling off my cheek
Yeah, ooo ooo, I can't do life without
Without your cool wind underneath my wings
Without you singing my harmonies
Yeah, ooo ooo, I can't do life without you, you
Without you, yeah
Without you, yeah

[Bridge: Chris Lane]
Nashville's got country
When you say you love me I got that luck
And I hope that you trust me when I say
I don't wanna live this life without you

[Chorus: Chris Lane & Danielle Bradbery]
Without your booty in my shotgun seat
Without your kisses rolling off my cheek
Yeah, ooo ooo, I can't do life without
Without your cool wind underneath my wings
Without you singing my harmonies
Yeah, ooo ooo, I can't do life without you, you
Without you, yeah
Without you, yeah

[Verse 1]
I can already see it coming
The way you're two drinks in and
You're spinning 'round on the floor
I ain't sure what you're sipping
But I'm sure you're sipping something
And that'll get you rolling the dice
To see if I'm still young
'Cause when it starts rolling off your lips
Baby I'm all in

[Chorus]
You say it all when you say that you miss me
Say my name when you lean in to kiss me
You play it off and blame it on the whiskey
'cause you're feeling all tipsy
It's game over when you cross that line
I lose every time
When you start drinking, that's when you get to
Thinking of swinging right back into my arms
Girl, I can't shake it, no, I can't take it when you start playing
Drinkin' games with my heart

[Verse 2]
You pull my shirt and you get a little closer
With the buzz in your eyes and the smell of lies
On your breath. Girl, you and I know you would never do
It sober, but all it takes is one too many for you to forget
And even though I never win, baby here we go again

[Chorus]
You say it all when you say that you miss me
Say my name when you lean in to kiss me
You play it off and blame it on the whiskey
'cause you're feeling all tipsy
It's game over when you cross that line
I lose every time
When you start drinking, that's when you get to
Thinking of swinging right back into my arms
Girl, I can't shake it, no, I can't take it when you start playing
Drinkin' games with my heart


[Chorus]
You say it all when you say that you miss me
Say my name when you lean in to kiss me
You play it off and blame it on the whiskey
'cause you're feeling all tipsy
It's game over when you cross that line
I lose every time
When you start drinking, that's when you get to
Thinking of swinging right back into my arms
Girl, I can't shake it, no, I can't take it when you start playing
Drinkin' games with my heart


[Outro]
Well you can tell that I'm a little bit lonely
I know myself, and I'm giving in slowly
You pour it strong, sip it all night long
Then you get what you want and you're gone in the morning
Well you can tell that I'm a little bit lonely
I know myself, and I'm giving in slowly
You pour it strong, sip it all night long
Then you get what you want and you're gone in the morning

[Verse 1]
You look a little lonely
Well I am too
Both getting over someone
Both had a few
Both waiting on a sad song that they don't play no more
Both about to throw in the towel, walk back out the door

[Pre-Chorus]
But I'm so glad you came
Both our stories sound the same
I don't even know your name
What's your name, what's your name?

[Chorus]
We got all the right problems in all the right places
Start with what you're drinking and see where it takes us
Hey, maybe two neon wrongs can make a right
Cause baby we got all the right problems tonight
All the right problems, baby

[Verse 2]
Is that your only tattoo?
Have you ever been to Costa Rica?
Me neither
We're getting there
Doubling down on these margaritas
Girl look at you and me
Having nowhere else to be
Let's try to fix a couple more until somebody makes us leave

[Chorus]
We got all the right problems in all the right places
Let's just keep on drinking and see where it takes us
Hey maybe two neon wrongs can make a right
Cause baby we got all the right problems tonight
All the right problems, baby

[Bridge]
Yeah, yeah well nothing gets solved in one night
But I'm sure having a heck of a time

[Chorus]
We got all the right problems in all the right places
Start with what you're drinking and see where it takes us
Hey, maybe two neon wrongs can make a right
Cause baby we got all the right problems tonight
All the right problems
All the right problems tonight

[Intro]
You're the number one regret on my list
Number one bad taste on my lips
Of all my favorite things I wish I hadn't done
Baby, you're number one

[Verse 1]
Ain't got nothing new I can sing about
Don't even matter who'd end up walking out
Things I can and do, things I can and say
There's your name right at the top of the page
You make me wanna pull you up on my stage
Put a gold medal 'round your neck and say

[Chorus 1]
You're the number one regret on my list
Number one bad taste on my lips
Number one reason my heart broke
But I might be somehow worse than her
But I guess I'll never know
And baby you're the best
At making me a mess
Of all my favorite things I wish I hadn't done
Baby, you're number one
Oh, oh, oh-oh, oh-ohh
Oh, oh, oh-oh, oh-ohh

[Verse 2]
I ain't even sure who's the second place
If you got that far it don't matter anyway
Had to break a heart, had to leave a scar
Every sad song, baby, you're the star

[Chorus 2]
You're the number one regret on my list
Number one bad taste on my lips
Number one reason my heart broke
But I might be somehow worse than her
But I guess I'll never know
And baby, you're the best (baby, you're the best)
At making me a mess (at making me a mess)
Of all my favorite things I wish I hadn't done
Baby, you're number one
Oh, oh, oh-oh, oh-ohh
Oh, oh, oh-oh, oh-ohh

[Bridge]
There's a lot of broken hearts
At the bottom of the charts
One by one they're dropping off
Ooh, while you'd stay right on top

[Chorus 3]
You're the number one regret on my list
Number one bad taste on my lips
Number one reason my heart broke
But I might be somehow worse than her
But I guess I'll never know
And baby, you're the best (baby, you're the best)
At making me a mess (at making me a mess)
Of all my favorite things I wish I hadn't done
Baby, you're number one
Oh, oh, oh-oh, oh-ohh
Oh, number one
Oh, oh, oh-oh, oh-ohh
Of all my favorite things I wish I hadn't done
Oh, oh, oh-oh, oh-ohh
Oh, oh, oh-oh, oh-ohh
Baby, you're number one
Oh, oh, oh-oh, oh-ohh
Oh, number one
Oh, oh, oh-oh, oh-ohh
Of all my favorite things I wish I hadn't done
Baby, you're number… one

[Verse 1]
You stole my heart, you tore my shirt
You sipped my drink, just smile and wink and it all works
And I pretend that I ain't hooked on you
But every time you walk away my night turns barlight blue
This ain't just a lie
You so dang fine

[Chorus]
I want you so bad girl
Just look at you looking like that
How's an old boy like me supposed to act
Knocking me out the second you crash
Right into my world
Baby, my world started spinning
Like old school Waylon Jennings on vinyl, yeah
I go around and around since you came around
And this cool I playin' is just a bad act
I want you so bad girl
Yeah, bad girl

[Verse 2]
Just wanna shoot you straight
Don't wanna freak you out
Don't wanna kick myself when I get home
For not locking this down
This ain't no [blame?], it's straight tequila
For them feelings that I'm feeling
And them kisses I'll be stealing tonight

[Chorus]
I want you so bad girl
Just look at you looking like that
How's an old boy like me supposed to act
Knocking me out the second you crash
Right into my world
Baby, my world started spinning
Like old school Waylon Jennings on vinyl, yeah
I go around and around since you came around
And this cool I playin' is just a bad act
'Cause I want you so bad girl
So bad girl

[Bridge]
Gets me high as the moon
When you walk in the room
Baby, swaying the way that you do

[Chorus]
I want you so bad girl
Just look at you looking like that
How's an old boy like me supposed to act
Knocking me out the second you crash
Right into my world
Baby, my world started spinning
Like old school Waylon Jennings on vinyl, yeah
I go around and around since you came around
And this cool I play is just a bad act
'Cause I want you so bad girl; bad girl
Yeah, I want you so bad girl; bad girl

[Verse 1]
Laying face first in an old box fan
Talking like Darth Vader
Nintendo, Tecmo Bowl
Bo Jackson, Oakland Raiders
Leather jacket with a glove on my hand
Moonwalking like Billy Jean
No, I wasn't tryna change the world
All I ever really wanted to be was

[Chorus]
Cool, cool
Yeah, we all wanna be cool, cool
Yeah, we all wanna be
Lost a little love, broke a few hearts
Lost a few nights shutting down bars
Lost a good fake ID or two
We never lost our cool
Lost friends and we lost touch
Got a little older, but we never grew up
There's a reason new school wants to be old school
We never lost our cool, cool
We never lost our cool, cool
We never lost our cool

[Post-Chorus]
Yeah, so cool
(Everybody wants to be cool)
So dang cool

[Verse 2]
Good old boys in a hip-hop phase
808s and a hoopty, hoopty
Can't sever them southern roots
Way down yonder on the Chattahoochie
Played a little football, third string
Had to get the girls with the six string
Playing every song 'til your fingers bleed
Doing everything just tryna be

[Chorus]
Cool, cool
Yeah, we all wanna be cool, cool
Yeah, we all wanna be
Lost a little love, broke a few hearts
Lost a few nights shutting down bars
Lost a good fake ID or two
We never lost our cool
Lost friends and we lost touch
Got a little older, but we never grew up
There's a reason new school wants to be old school
We never lost our cool, cool
We never lost our cool, cool
Yeah, we all wanna be

[Bridge]
Cooler than the whip on the top of the pie
Cooler than the gang celebrating tonight
Kool Aid mustache, 4th of July
So dang cool, you don't have to try
You're just cool
Yeah, we all wanna be cool
Yeah, we all wanna be

[Chorus]
Cool, cool
Yeah, we all wanna be cool, cool
Yeah, we all wanna be
We lost a little love, broke a few hearts
Lost a few nights shutting down bars
Lost a good fake ID or two
We never lost our cool
Lost friends and we lost touch
Got a little older, but we never grew up
There's a reason new school wants to be old school
We never lost our cool, cool
We never lost our cool, cool
We never lost our cool

[Post-Chorus]
Yeah, so cool
(Everybody just wants to be cool)
So dang cool

[Verse 1]
Quick stop at the quick sack
Six in on a 12-pack
Way too many people in the back
Hey girl, I guess you gotta sit on my lap, oh well
Climb through the barbed wire
Light something on fire
And just watch me get higher
Yeah, gonna be another all-nighter

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Yeah, we're just living, living
Doing a little sipping, sipping
Seeing who's kissing on who
Yeah, take off running when the lights turn blue

[Chorus]
Might call it crazy
Call it young and dumb and dangerous
They can call the cops on us
Call it never growing up
Call it what you like
But out here, way out here
Yeah, we just call it Saturday night
Yeah, we just call it Saturday night
Said ain't nothing but another Saturday night

[Verse 2]
Find a place where we all park
Drop a tailgate and make a bar
Drop the jolly rancher in the jar
'Til there's a halo around the stars, uh huh
All the girls wanna skinny dip
They shimmy them shorts off of their hips
Somebody got a busted lip
Tryna do a rope swing cannonball flip, yep

[Pre-Chorus 2]
We're getting rowdy, rowdy
When your head gets cloudy, cloudy
Hey baby, how 'bout we see
Just how loud we can be

[Chorus]
Might call it crazy
Call it young and dumb and dangerous
They can call the cops on us
Call it never growing up
Call it what you like
But out here, way out here
Yeah, we just call it Saturday night
Yeah, we just call it Saturday night
Said ain't nothing but another Saturday night

[Bridge]
And just another day
And in the summertime, it's every other day
Hey baby, do I make you wanna say ooh
When you're restless and you're thirsty
You can act like it's your birthday
Yeah, we do it right, yeah, we do it right
Out here, don't you know that a Saturday night

[Chorus]
Gets crazy
It gets young and dumb and dangerous
Let 'em call the cops on us
They can call it never growing up
They call it what you like
But out here, way out here
Yeah, we just call it Saturday night
Yeah, we just call it Saturday night
Said ain't nothing but another Saturday night
Yeah, we just call it Saturday night
Said ain't nothing but another Saturday night

[Verse 1]
I don't know what to do with myself
Friday night, there's a handle on the shelf
I could use a hand, I could use some help
Lord, knows I've been going through hell
Might step outside, catch a breath of fresh air
Or I might just drop to the middle of nowhere
Do a little soul-searching, little moonlight churching

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause my world's gone numb and I just wanna feel something
Running low on hope and I don't know if I can overcome it

[Chorus]
I ain't drunk and I ain't stoned
Just been wondering all night long
They say the sun's still gonna dawn
But baby you're good and gone
So right now I don't see how life goes on
How life goes on

[Verse 2]
Used to be on a Friday night
Baby, you and me be under neon lights
Smell the smoke all over our clothes
We hang around till the whole town closed
Now every bar I pass makes my heart head South
Every drink I have leaves a bad taste in my mouth
And baby that's why

[Chorus]
I ain't drunk and I ain't stoned
Just been wondering all night long
They say the sun's still gonna dawn
But baby you're good and gone
So right now I don't see how life goes on
How life goes on
Come on!
Tell me life goes on

[Bridge]
Baby, how do you make leaving me look so easy?
Yeah, I'm trying so hard but I'm so far from believing
That life goes on
Yeah, life goes on

[Chorus]
I ain't drunk and I ain't stoned
Just been wondering all night long
They say the sun's still gonna dawn
But baby you're good and gone
So right now I don't see how life goes on
How life goes on
'Cause I ain't drunk and I ain't stoned
Just been wondering all night long, yeah
Yes, and the sun's still gonna dawn
But baby you're good and gone
So right now I don't see how life goes on
Yeah, life goes on
Tell me life goes on
Yeah, life goes on

[Verse  1]
Paint your nails, sunglasses and a day crew
Off the show to cover up, it ain't hard to
Soak it all in, I take a picture
In my mind, like a permanent fixture
Beach ball with a picnic table
Paper cups full of platinum labels
Shots, umbrella, blue shade
We came all this way

[Pre-Chorus 1]
To see the waves break
Half a mile away babe

[Chorus]
While we twist a little lime in a cold Corona
Let that [emo time?] take the moment over
Wash it away in that sugar sand haze all afternoon
Yeah, hang and chill
Ain't nobody else got this kind of view
Watching the sun kiss you

[Verse 2]
Every round we sink a little deeper
Red Red Wine playing through the speakers
Lean in and taste the salt from your lips
From the last round margarita sip
Girl, you make me wanna stay out here
Till the sunset disappears
Kind of drunk, just talking 'bout nothing

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Baby, maybe when they left stars out
We'll close up but right now

[Chorus]
Let's just twist a little lime in a cold Corona
Let that [emo time?] take the moment over
Wash it away in that sugar sand haze all afternoon
Yeah, hang and chill
Ain't nobody else got this kind of view
Watching the sun kiss you

[Interlude]

[Chorus]
Let's just twist a little lime in a cold Corona
Let that [emo time?] take the moment over
Just wash it away in that sugar sand haze all afternoon
Yeah, hang and chill
Nobody in the world got this kind of view
Watching the sun kiss you

[Outro]
Ain't nobody in the world got this kind of view
Watching the sun kiss you

[Verse 1]
I never leave it sitting there all alone
It's like he doesn't know what he's got at home
I'm coming to pick you up even if it's wrong
Cause you're a deluxe custom body style

[Pre-Chorus]
You make me wanna go too fast
Pedal heavy on the gas
Run away and never come back
I don't wanna ever get caught
Cause I don't wanna give you up
Let 'em come and lock me up

[Chorus]
Your love is a stolen car
One look, one touch and I had to have it
I had to have it
He had you sitting in park
Like a thief in the night, I have to have it
I have to have you

[Verse 2]
I wanna rev you up, wanna hear you purr
Red line the night with every turn
Run my hands along your every curve
Cause you're a deluxe custom body style

[Pre-Chorus]
You make me wanna go too fast
Pedal heavy on the gas
Run away and never come back

[Chorus]
Your love is a stolen car
One look, one touch and I had to have it
I had to have it
He had you sitting in park
Like a thief in the night, I have to have it
I have to have you

[Bridge]
It's like he gave me his permission
To your red Ferrari lips
Leaving the keys in the ignition
How could I not just steal one kiss?

[Pre-Chorus]
You make me wanna go too fast
Pedal heavy on the gas
Run away and never come back
I don't wanna ever get caught
Cause I don't wanna give you up
Let 'em come and lock me up

[Chorus]
Your love is a stolen car
One look, one touch and I had to have it
I had to have it
He had you sitting in park
Like a thief in the night, I have to have it
I have to have you

[Outro]
Your love is a stolen car
Your love is a stolen car

I grew up here where there ain't much blacktop
The headlights on the interstate don't stop
Any man worth his weight plows a straight row
And all the money is the grain in the silo

And there's just enough home grown pretty girls
Growin' up around here that like to sip cold beer
It's a blink and you miss it kind of town
The kind of place that makes the world go round

My wheels have rolled all this red dirt
My hands have got scars from the hard work
Me and my friends unwind on the outskirts
Our Friday nights might get a little black and blue

I'm out here ridin' high on a lift kit
I see the world through a crack where a rock hit
I am who I am I do what I do
Lookin' at life from a broken windshield view

A truck bed's got a half roll of barb wire
A bale of hay and a patched up spare tire
Cross on a chain hangin' from a rearview
Fifth in a brown paper sack packin'eighty proof

Well sun droppin' off into that cornfield
Thunderhead lightnin' comin' right behind it
These two lane roads ain't paved in gold
Man flyin' gravel's all I know

My wheels have rolled all this red dirt
My hands have got scars from the hard work
Me and my friends unwind on the outskirts
Our Friday nights might get a little black and blue

I'm out here ridin' high on a lift kit
I see the world through a crack where a rock hit
I am who I am I do what I do
Lookin' at life from a broken windshield view

Yeah, c'mon

Yeah, It's a blink and you miss it kind of town
The kind of place that makes the world go round

My wheels have rolled all this red dirt
My hands have got scars from the hard work
Me and my friends unwind on the outskirts
Our Friday nights might get a little black and blue

I'm out here ridin' high on a lift kit
I see the world through a crack where a rock hit
I am who I am I do what I do
Lookin' at life from a broken windshield view

I am who I am I do what I do
Lookin' at life from a broken windshield view

From a broken windshield view

Yeah

[Verse 1]
All the boats I've missed
All the hell I've caused
All the lips I've kissed
All the love I've lost
I got kicked around
I've been black and blue
On my way to you

[Verse 2]
All the stars I've seen
All the songs I've sung
All the beers I've drank
All the damage done
I was just passin' time
Kinda just passin' through
On my way to you

[Chorus]
Every curve, every ditch
Every turn, every bridge
I left behind me up in smoke
Every fork in the road
It was all worth the while
When I finally saw your smile
Every highway, every heartbreak
Every mountain, every mile

[Verse 3]
I got the radio up
Sun is going down
I’ll take a left at the bank
And I’ll head straight through town
So baby, put on that dress
A little sweet perfume
‘Cause I’m on my way to you

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
Yeah, every curve, every ditch
Every turn, every bridge
I left behind me up in smoke
Every fork in the road
It was all worth the while
When I finally saw your smile
Every highway, every heartbreak
Every mountain, every mile

[Verse 4]
All the boats I’ve missed
All the hell I’ve caused
All the lips I’ve kissed
All the love I’ve lost
I thank God for that
I guess he always knew
I was on my way to you

[Outro]
On my way to you
On my way to you

[Verse 1]
Wearing your black dress, red shoes
Makeup, perfume, and diamonds
You always impress, turn heads
The second you walk through the door
You're like a real life work of fine art
Baby, you're priceless
And I just wanna get on, get that black dress down on the floor

[Chorus]
'Cause when you got nothin' on
There ain't nothin' wrong
Lovin' you all night long's all I wanna do
I've seen the mountains high
I've sailed the ocean blue
But when you got nothin' on
Ain't nothin' got nothin' on you

[Verse 2]
You're better than Venice, Vegas, New York, LA, Paris
Baby you're Vermont in the fall
The Grand Canyon on a full moon
Oh and they can keep those highrise, high price mansions
I wouldn't trade places
Long as I'm here with you baby
I've got a room with a view

[Chorus]
'Cause when you got nothin' on
There ain't nothin' wrong
Lovin' you all night long's all I wanna do
I've seen the mountains high
I've sailed the ocean blue
But when you got nothin' on
Ain't nothin' got nothin' on you

[Outro]
Yeah, 'cause I've seen the mountains high
I've sailed the ocean blue
But when you got nothin' on
Ain't nothin' got nothin' on you
When you got nothin' on, ain't nothin' got nothin' on you
Ain't nothin' got nothin' on you baby

[Verse 1]
Same old scenario
One guy's young and one guy's old
One's in love and sittin' on dough
And one's already walked that road
One's on year number 33
And one just bought that diamond ring
One says "Dad, so how'd you do it?"
The other just laughs and says "There ain't nothin' to it"

[Chorus]
Just try to quit smokin' and reel back the drinkin'
Don't always tell her everything you're thinkin'
And dance her when she needs dancin'
You get up and go to work, get up and go to church
Crawl up in that bed right next to her and listen
Instead of having all the answers
Then he slapped him on the back and said
"Son, you can breathe, there ain't nothin' to it"

[Verse 2]
There'll be trouble along the way
Words will fly and dishes break
The baby comes in and money goes out
You will learn to ride the ups and downs
You'll wanna quit a million times
But if you hang on, the years unwind
And when you get to see your blushing bride
Turn beautiful at 35, or 45, or 55

[Chorus]
You'll be glad you quit smokin' and reeled back the drinkin'
Didn't always tell her everything you were thinkin'
And danced her when she needed dancin'
You got up and went to work, got up and went to church
Crawled up in that bed right next to her and listened
Instead of having all the answers
It's only love and all of us go through it
And if I had to do it again you know I'd do it
There ain't nothin' to it
No, there ain't nothin' to it

You can here my engine hummin', comin' rumblin' up the road
And I know when you meet me at the fence line in the sunshine you'll be
Lookin' fine in your bandanna and your blue jeans
Baby, would you ride with me
So climb up in the seat put your bare feet up tap along with the radio
Girl we can go kick around downtown with the top down we can
Follow this county road wherever it leads
Baby, would you ride with me

(Chorus)
Take my hand, say I do
I want to go down this road with you
High and low, thick and thin
Forevers just around the bend
And we'll be right where we want to be, baby, would you ride with me
You know life is a bull when the gate its pulled and you better be holding on tight
Its a roller coaster, flippin' over
It's a sailboat on the tide, on the wide open seas
Baby, would you ride with me

(Chorus)
Take my hand, say I do
I want to go down this road with you
High and low, thick and thin
Forevers just around the bend
And we'll be right where we want to be, baby, would you ride with me
Well I've thinking all day that life is a highway we all travel on
The one that I want to see sittin' in the seat with me when I
Make my dreams come true, its you, its you
And it feels so fine when you..

(Chorus)
Take my hand, say I do
I want to go down this road with you
High and low, thick and thin
Forevers just around the bend
And we'll be right where we want to be, so baby, would you ride with me
Come on and take a ride with me

[Intro]
I got to thinking about all the stuff we worry about and I realized that all that man really needs is a horse you can catch when you need him, a dog that'll come when you call, a good friend who owns an arena, and a trailer that's legal to haul, a woman who'll share my frustrations when the cow market's falling apart, a pair of good spurs, a saddle that fits, and a one ton Ford pick-up that starts. Everything else is window dressing

[Verse 1]
I'm out here chasing these rainbows that I need to find
I go and Lord knows it kills me to leave her behind
She drew a low card when she gave me her heart
And sometimes it's hard to believe
That sweet little angel went and got herself tangled
In the arms of a cowboy like me

[Chorus]
Well I know that she deserves more than a drifter that lives for the lights
Smokey bars and guitars don't make for no fairy tale lie
And every time I head home I think I'll find her gone
But she's still there and still wants to be
In the arms of a cowboy like me

[Verse 2]
She's worn a hole in the carpet between the bed and the phone
She worries about me when I leave til I'm back home
Cause there's downtime for killing, there's whiskey and women
It's just right for filling a need
Oh, but she's in no danger
There's no room for a stranger
In the arms of a cowboy like me

[Chorus]
Well I know that she deserves more than a drifter that lives for the lights
Smokey bars and guitars don't make for no fairy tale lie
And every time I head home I think I'll find her gone
But she's still there and still wants to be
In the arms of a cowboy like me

And every time I head home I think I'll find her gone
But she's still there and still wants to be
In the arms of a cowboy like me (x2)

I’ve never been a “Cool Hand Luke”
The quarterback of the winning team
Or the guy with the right kinda punch-lines
Everybody wants to be
I never was that lucky ol cuss with a straight flush in his hand
Oh, but with you, I am

I ain’t no Patrick Swayze, my old boots never danced on air
Never walked with a swag looking sharp as a tack
Lit up like Time Square
Who’s that guy with a big old smile as wide as the Rio Grande
Oh, with you I am

Strong as an oak, soft like leather
High as a pine and light as a feather
The same ol boy but a whole lot better
Whenever you’re holding my hand
I use to poke fun at them punch drunk lovers
I never thought I’d be that man
Oh but with you I am, Oh baby with you I am

I’ve always been a “do it my way” drifter
Another highway, another town
Never thought about bout that little white house
With a porch all the way around
Yeah I never saw me on a swing talking sweet talking dreams but I’ll be damned
With you I am

Strong as an oak, soft like leather
High as a pine and light as a feather
The same ol boy but a whole lot better
Whenever you’re holding my hand
I use to poke fun at them punch drunk lovers
I never thought I’d be that man
Oh baby with you, I am
Oh baby with you, I am

[Verse 1]
Here's the truth, I refuse to argue with you baby
Can't tell you what to do
But I'm not some johnny come lately
So there's the door you can walk right through
Cause tonight I don't care about losing you

[Chorus]
Oh tonight I don't care about trying to make things right
And I'm just not in the mood and I'm damn sure not gonna fight tonight
And if this is some kind of premonition
Of how it's gonna be with you
I'm out, I'm done baby I'm through
Cause tonight I don't care about you

[Verse 2]
So there it is, that's all that needs to be said baby
I don't care about your friends
And what they seem to think that you need lately
If you don't want to believe me, I guess I'm every bit of the jerk that you say I am
But tonight I don't give a damn

[Chorus]
Cause tonight I don't care about trying to make things right
I'm just not in the mood and I'm damn sure not gonna fight tonight
And if this is some kind of premonition
Of how it's gonna be with you
I'm out, I'm done baby I'm through
Cause tonight I don't care about you

[Verse 3]
Well it's not to say that tomorrow morning
I won't change my mind
But tonight you better listen to my warning
I need a little time

[Chorus]
Cause tonight I don't care about trying to make things right
I'm just not in the mood and I'm damn sure not gonna fight tonight
And if this is some kind of premonition
Of how it's gonna be with you
I'm out, I'm done baby I'm through
Cause tonight I don't care about you

[Outro]
There it is that's all that needs to be said baby

Scatter gun blast, tens in the air
Half a million in a burlap sack
Y'all have a nice day as we make our way
To the caddie in the ally out back
See when the times get hard
Some good old boys turn to a life a sin
We're like Robin Hood, we're just twice as good
But we can never go home again

Well I grew up singing Amazing Grace
In a little white church in the woods
My momma prayed hard for all her boys
But her praying didn't do a bit of good
The sheriff and a banker man came to push us off of our land
Now we're six feet deep
And my brothers and me we can never go home again

Lord forgive me, I know just what I do
I'll take what I need and then
I leave the rest to my momma and you
And that tin roof cabin might not have been heaven
But it's closer than I've ever been
God bless an outlaw's weary soul
I can never go home again

Sometimes I dream of that old front porch and my momma patching up a quilt
While my brothers and me lay around in the shade of that live oak tree on the hill
Now it's hide-out shacks, better watch your back and cover every track of where you've been
A thousand wrongs will never make it right, I can never go home again

Lord forgive me, I know just what I do
I'll take what I need and then
I leave the rest to my momma and you
And that tin roof cabin might not have been heaven
But it's closer than I've ever been
God bless an outlaw's weary soul
I can never go home again

Scatter gun blast tears a ten inch hole
Through an empty burlap sack
As I say my peace for my brothers and me
My whole world fades to black
Here's three new graves underneath the shade of
That live oak tree on the hill
Overlooking momma's porch with a fresh coat of paint
And a shiny new Coup De Ville

Lord forgive me, I know just what I've done
I've been through hell and found myself on the wrong end of a gun
And that tin roof cabin might not have been heaven but it's closer than I've ever been
God bless an outlaw's weary soul, I thought I'd never make it home
God bless an outlaw's weary soul, I guess I finally made it home again

[Verse 1]
Dear Rodeo
I'd be lying if I tried to tell you I don’t think about you
After all the miles and the wild nights that we been through
Lord knows we had a few

[Verse 2]
Dear Rodeo
I'd like to say that I took the reins and rode away
No regrets, no left-unsaids, just turn the page
Oh, but you know better, babe

[Chorus]
'Tween them almost-had-’ems and broken bones
The dream of a buckle I'll never put on
I'm jaded, whoa, I hate it
But somehow the highs outweigh the lows
And I'd do it all again even though we both know
I'd still have to let you go

[Verse 3]
So dear Rodeo
I tried like hell to tell myself it was all your fault
I held on tight with all my might, I just couldn't hang on
And that's hard to hang your hat on

[Chorus]
'Tween them almost-had-’ems and the broken bones
The dream of a buckle I’ll never put on
I'm jaded, whoa, I hate it
But somehow the highs outweigh the lows
And I’d do it all again even though we both know
I'd still have to let you go

[Instrumental Bridge]

[Verse 4]
Dear Rodeo
I'd like to think you miss me too, but I know you don't
Oh, but that don’t change the past and that don't change the truth
I'm still in love with you
Dear Rodeo

You're like waking in the morning by a mountain stream
You're like watching that eagle floating on the breeze
As I listen to you dreaming by my side
I wish I could call you mine

But you belong where the four winds blow
Out where the untamed mustang roam
Like a sweet summer rain, passing through
Never seen anything wild as you

I could stay with you like this
Till the day love don't exist
Wild flowers bloom in an open field
And wither in a vase on a window seal

But you belong where the four winds blow
Out where the untamed mustang roam
Like a sweet summer rain passing through
Never seen anything wild as you

There's a part of me that prays
That you'll hang up your wings someday
But the part that truly does love you
Always hopes you never do

'Cause you belong where your heart can be
Out in the open, wild, and free
Like a sweet summer rain, passing through
I ain't never seen anything wild as you

You belong where the four winds blow
Out where the untamed mustang roam
Like a sweet summer rain, passing through
Never seen anything wild as you

You belong where the four winds blow
Out where the untamed mustang roam
Like a sweet summer rain, passing through
Never seen anything wild as you

[Verse 1]
If you give a cowboy a horse and a stretch of fence
You can bet the farm he'll ride all day til the whole damn thing is fixed
He'll come dragging back around along about supper time

If you give a cowboy a truck on a friday night
He'll bore a hundred dollar bill from the coffee can
Spray the mud off of them tires, drop twenty dollars in the tank, save the rest for beer

So all you girls in here need to know this

[Chorus]
If you give a cowboy a kiss he'll want more
He's gonna want to give you a twist out on that hardwood floor
If you let him, girl if you let him
He's gonna sit you down on his tailgate
Pull out his guitar and play some George Strait
Pretty baby, that's just the way it is, if you give a cowboy a kiss

[Verse 2]
If you tell a cowboy he can't he'll prove he can
Cause there really ain't nothing much that he can't do with his two hands
He can fight his way out of corners, or he can softly lay you down
There ain't no time like now to find out

[Chorus]
If you give a cowboy a kiss he'll want more
He's gonna want to give you a twist out on that hardwood floor
If you let him, girl if you let him
He's gonna sit you down on his tailgate
Pull out his guitar and play some George Strait
Pretty baby, that's just the way it is
If you give a cowboy a kiss

Hear the ocean wind, it'll take the shore
If you take a chance on love tonight here's what's in store
If you give a cowboy a kiss
If you give a cowboy a kiss he's gonna sit you down on his tailgate
Pull out his guitar and play some George Strait
Pretty baby, that's just the way it is
If you give a cowboy a kiss
If you give a cowboy a kiss

[Verse 1]
I wish I had a third-floor motel room
On the dark side of the moon
Up there with the satellites in the sky
If you knew anything about her, you'd understand why
I used to believe in love
And all that forever stuff
But now I'm startin' to think it was one big lie
If you knew anything her, you'd understand why

[Chorus]
She's a seawall on the coast in stormy weather
She's that C22, go-to jukebox song
I had small town dreams of us together
But now she's gone

[Verse 2]
I don't dance with 90 proof
Or smoke weed like I used to
But right now I sure could use the high
If you knew anything about her, you'd understand why, yeah

[Instrumental break]

[Chorus]
Yeah she's a seawall on the coast in stormy weather
She's that C22, go-to jukebox song
I had small-town dreams of us together
But now she's gone

[Outro]
I wish I had a third floor motel room
On the dark side of the moon
Up there with the satellites in the sky
If you knew anything about her, you'd understand why
If you knew anything about her
You'd understand why

Here she comes walkin' in, cotton dress a swishin'
Smoke is thick and the lights are dim and she sure got me wishin'
For a little bit of time out on that ol' dancefloor
If she gives me half a chance at romance i'm gonna dance her home

Hey bartender see that girl ask her what shes drinkin'
Tell her if she looks this way ill be the one awakin'
Cause I saw her light up when the dj played a little George Jones
If she gives me half a chance at romance im gonna dance her home

Cause if we got to two-steppin' we could come up missin'
And find a corner booth of our own
Just a huggin' and a kissin' like two lovers reminiscin'
Man this feelings comin' on strong
If she gives me half a chance at romance im gonna dance her home (aw yeah)

What the hell is wrong with me I feel like i'm sinkin'
How hard can it really be to tell her what i'm thinkin'
That if we got to two-steppin', we could come up missin'
And find a corner booth of our own
Just a huggin' and a kissin' like two lovers reminiscin'
Man this feelings comin' on strong
If she gives me half a chance at romance i'm gonna dance her home
If she gives me half a chance at romance(x3)
I'm gonna dance her home(x2)

I thought number one
Would surely be me
I thought I could be
What I wanted to be
I thought I could build
On life's sinking sand
But now I can't even walk
Without you holding my hand

I thought I could do a lot on my own
I thought I could make it all day long
I thought of myself as a mighty big man
But Lord I can't even walk
Without you holding my hand

O Lord I can't even walk
Without you holding my hand
The mountains too high
And the valleys too wide
Down on my knees
That's where I learned to stand
O Lord I can't even walk
Without you holding my hand

I think I'll make Jesus my all and all
And if I'm in trouble
On his name I'll call
If I didn't trust him
I'd be less of a man
Cause Lord I can't even walk
Without you holding my hand

O Lord I can't even walk
Without you holding my hand
The mountains too high
And the valleys too wide
Down on my knees
That's where I learned to stand
Cause Lord I can't even walk
Without you holding my hand

O Lord I can't even walk
Without you holding my hand

Once I had me a woman
Everything was goin' my way
She thought I had hung the moon
And she had an angels face
Till' one night I pulled in my drive
And somethin' was goin' on
There was a long bed Ford in my spot
That I damn sure didn't own
So I walked up to the screen door
And I heard this awful noise
I moved on to the living room and there sat my two boys
I said "Where's mama?"
And they both pointed to the bedroom down the hall
Now, I ain't ever been a fightin' man
But red was all I saw

(Chorus)
See brother 'cause I've been down and I've been out
And I know how it feels
To stand up for what you think is right
Then get knocked off your heels
And if murderin a man who didn't understand
Just what she meant to me
Means I'll rot here in this cell for eternity
Well then mister I'm as guilty as can be
Well I wish I had me a picture of what his face looked like
When I kicked in my bedroom door and raised my 45
See I ain't the kind to hurt a woman and I hope you understand
But somebody's got to die today
Son it looks like you're the man

(Chorus)
See brother 'cause I've been down and I've been out
And I know how it feels
To stand up for what you think is right
Then get knocked off your heels
And if murderin a man who didn't understand
Just what she meant to me
Means I'll rot here in this cell for eternity
Well then mister I'm as guilty as can be
That's what I told that jury
That's what I told that judge
And I knew there'd be hell to pay if I fulfilled my grudge
See I don't mind these prison bars tucked off in these pine trees
One thing about that cheatin' woman
She won't cheat again on me

(Chorus)
See brother 'cause I've been down and I've been out
And I know how it feels
To stand up for what you think is right
Then get knocked off your heels
And if murderin a man who didn't understand
Just what she meant to me
Means I'll rot here in this cell for eternity
Well then mister I'm as guilty as can be
I said if murderin a man who didn't understand
Just what she meant to me
Means I'll rot here in this cell for eternity
Well than mister I'm as guilty as can be
Go ahead and lock me up boys
I'm guilty anyways

[Verse 1]
Monday morning Merle
Don't worry ’bout the girl he used to love
Tuesday's throwback, Springsteen
"Devils & Dust"

[Chorus]
Wednesday spins the Beatles
Thursday is the Eagles
"Take It Easy" 'til that Friday rocks his world
After Saturday on Jackson Browne
He’s Sunday morning coming down
Then he's right back to missing that girl
Turns up "Misery and Gin"
Here we are again
At Monday morning Merle

[Verse 2]
Monday morning Merle
Lets that old broken heart get back to work
He hides all the holes and the hurt
Under the dirt on his shirt
And the only way that he can get
Through the days and the regret
Is a song full of truth with some words he never said
With those whiskey remedies
And those old school melodies you can't forget

[Chorus]
That's why on Wednesday spins the Beatles
Thursday is the Eagles
"Take It Easy" 'til that Friday rocks his world
After Saturday on Jackson Browne
He's Sunday morning coming down
And he's right back to missing that girl
Turns up "Misery and Gin"
Here we are again
Monday morning Merle

[Instrumental Bridge]

[Chorus]
Wednesday spins the Beatles
Thursday is the Eagles
"Take It Easy" 'til that Friday rocks his world
After Saturday on Jackson Browne
He’s Sunday morning coming down
And he’s right back to missing that girl
Turns up "Misery and Gin"
Here we are again
At Monday morning Merle

[Outro]
That's just the way I am
Sing me back home again
To Monday morning Merle
Monday morning Merle

Yeah that's my old girlfriend
Saw her when she walked in
Her hair's a little longer but she's still lookin' stronger than sin

No I don't care if you buy her a drink
But she's not the kind of girl you think
Oh cause back when we were lovin' she thought cowboys were something
Now they ain't

Cause she's over buckles
She's over spurs
To her you're just a heartache in a pearl snap shirt
Been lassoed and let go for the last time
No she ain't just over me, she's over me and my kind

I guess I ruined it for the rest of us
When I left her standing in my dust
Oh and lately she's been hating rodeos and Copenhagen, and trucks

Yeah she's over buckles
She's over spurs
To her you're just a heartache in a pearl snap shirt
Been lassoed and let go for the first time
No she ain't just over me, she's over me and my kind

Yeah she's over buckles
She's over spurs
To her you're just a heartache in a Wrangler pearl snap shirt
Lassoed and let go for the last time
She ain't just over me, she's over me and my kind
She ain't just over me, she's over me and my kind

I love the way her blue eyes always make my day
I love the way she always knows the words to say
I love the way she falls asleep with her head on my chest
But I love the way she loves me the best
I love the way my mama swears she's the one for me
I love the way she looks when she wears my grandma's ring
And I love the way she looked at me on the day that she said yes
But I love the way she loves me the best

(Chorus)
When she loves me she makes me feel like I'm the only man in this whole world
The way she loves me she makes me wonder what I would do without the girl
And of all the things she does for me I must confess
That I just love the way she loves me the best
I love the way she knows how to put a grown man in his place
I love the way she looks without any makeup on her face
I love the way she tangles me in her sweet corese
I just love the way she loves me the best

(Chorus)
When she loves me she makes me feel like I'm the only man in this whole world
The way she loves me she makes me wonder what I would do without the girl
And of all the things she does for me I must confess
That I just love the way she loves me the best
And of all the things she does for me I must confess
That I just love the way she loves me the best

Saturday night and the moon is out
Just shinin' over top of the pines
I'm headin' on down to my baby's house
Gonna take her on a midnight ride
Now I'm on these backroads winding down to Kickapoo Creek
Dancin' and singin' to some good ol' boys like me
Baby, there's a shooting star
That was for me and you
So, hold me tight, make that wish, and pray that it comes true
I ain't sure of much
But this I know -
I got a diamond in my pocket and my baby's got a heart of gold
I brought along a little courage and coleman cooler Just to help me out
My hands are shaking like canebrake rattler
Nothing's gonna save me now
Might as well jump in head first; lay it all on the line
What am I worrying about never gonna be a more perfect time
Cause baby, there's a shooting star
That was for me and you
So, hold me tight, and make that wish, and pray that it comes true
I ain't sure of much
But this I know...
I got a diamond in my pocket and my baby's got a heart of gold
Well I didn't have money for a broadway show but the crickets are singing to the radio
And we got tickets, on the very front porchhhhhh
Baby, there's a shooting star
That was for me and you
So, hold me tight, and make that wish, and pray that it comes true
I ain't sure of much
But this I know...
I got a diamond in my pocket and my baby's got a heart of gold
I got a diamond in my pocket and my baby's got a heart of gold

Another Jake brake wakes me up to a hotel lobby coffee cup
That dirty old white pickup truck
With the trailer hooked up by the Denny's, she's mine
Last night's bugs on the windshield
Fast food trash on the dash meal
Speedin' ticket and a doctor bill
From a gash I got from a short go in Casper
Summer of last year, maybe next year

And I ride, and I fall, one day I might win 'em all
Just some broken hearts and broken bones
And a hell of a whole lot of bein' alone
But I ride, and I roam, where I hang my hat is home
This cowboy life might kill me, but it's the only one I know

Cell phone was breakin' up
The night she called to say she'd had enough
Of my little white lies and little white lines and wantin' somebody who could never be with her
I look back on every fork in the road
That I took to chase that buckle of gold
And wonder if what I held for what I hold is worth tradin' away
Hell I don't know, all I know

Is I ride, and I fall, one day I might win 'em all
Just some broken hearts and broken bones
And a hell of a whole lot of bein' alone
But I ride, and I roam, where I hang my hat is home
This cowboy life might kill me, but it's the only one I know

Yeah it'll kill me, before it ever lets me go
It'll kill me, but it's the only life I know
And I'd rather die than be caught cryin'
So I'm just smilin', wear my hat down low
Wear my hat down low

And I ride, and I fall, one day I might win 'em all
Just some broken hearts and broken bones
And a hell of a whole lot of bein' alone
But I ride, and I roam, where I hang my hat is home
This cowboy life might kill me, but it's the only one I know
Yeah this cowboy life might kill me, but it's the only one I know

[Verse 1]
If anybody's gonna get a drunk tattoo and own it
If anybody's got four cinder blocks
With a fixer-upper sittin' up on it
If anybody's got a buzzin' side-door speaker
'Cause Chattahoochee done blown it
And the only thing that they don't give is a damn

[Chorus]
It's y'all people
Talkin' with a long drawl people
Buck head on the wall people
Y'all people make a stranger feel right at home
Pour 'em up tall, people
A-come one and come all, people
If I'm gonna drink one, smoke one, tie one on
With anybody under the sun, come on
It's y'all people

[Verse 2]
If there's anybody I want out on the road when I break down
If anybody's got a string of Christmas lights that they don't take down
Need a hand, need a shovel, need a ride on the double
Don't take but a minute, they're way down
If there's anybody I wish there was just a few more of

[Chorus]
It's y'all people
Talkin' with a long drawl people
Buck head on the wall people
Y'all people make a stranger feel right at home
Pour 'em up tall, people
A-come one and come all, people
If I'm gonna drink one, smoke one, tie one on
With anybody under the sun, come on
It's y'all people

[Bridge]
Talkin' 'bout y'all people
Football in the fall people
We grew up on McGraw people
Y'all people, yeah

[Chorus]
That's right, it's y'all people
Talkin' with a long drawl people
Buck head on the wall people
Y'all people make a stranger feel right at home
So pour 'em up tall, people
A-come one, come all, people
If I'm gonna drink one, smoke one, tie one on
With anybody under the sun, come on
It's y'all people

[Outro]
That's right, it's y'all people

The smell of coffee hits me while I open up my eyes
A southern angel wearing nothing but an apron and a smile
I say thank you sweet lord Jesus tell the truth don't know how I got so lucky
All them boys from back in high school wonder how I'm still alive

Hooked by a bull dove off a blue lake bridge and wrecked my pick-up twice
Then she picked this here country boy out of all them other guys
Boy's that's lucky

Well I got a couple buddies playing football in the pros
And I know this guy who owns a whole dang beach in Mexico
There's some with good looks, some with brains, some rolling in the dough, but ya'll trust me, I'd rather be lucky
Now you can win a power ball with a million in the pot, then go on in with an Ace and King and hit a straight flush on the flop
You can sit here on this creek bank with a girl this hot, man that's plain lucky

Ya my old college roommate is some big software CEO
My cousin benches 405 and flies his jet to Rome

There's some with good looks, some with brains, some rolling in the dough, but y'all trust me, I'd rather be lucky
Well my baby's one in a million fellas, and I tell you that's the truth

So while you're out searching for one that's sweet and smart and sexy too
I'll be home sipping a cold one for you, here's to hoping you get lucky
I hope you get lucky

Cause they sing about the girl I got on the radio
She's a cross between a color of an outdoor life and vogue
There's folks who think they got it all, folks rolling in the dough, but ya'll trust me, Yeah I'd rather be lucky
I'd rather be lucky
I'd rather be lucky than good than any day of the week, girl

[Verse 1]
I can hear those trucks on the highway tonight
I can hear those kids down the block playin' ball
I can hear the drone of my boss in my head
Sayin' "This weekend I need you on call"
The volume's up, the pressure's on, the phone is buzzin'
You're the only reason that I don't go crazy

[Chorus]
'Cause when we kiss, the world outside is gone
And whatever longing there is moves on
My heart doesn't have any choice
When I hear my name on your voice
Everything else, everything else is just noise

[Verse 2]
Your eyes cut through every distraction
Through the rage of the machine and the roar of the engines
This rock keeps turning, this city don't sleep
You're my secret shelter when I can't find peace
The way you touch, the way you whisper
Way you love and how it lingers
You can make it all go away

[Chorus]
'Cause when we kiss, the world outside is gone
And whatever longing there is moves on
My heart doesn't have any choice
When I hear my name on your voice
Everything else, everything else is just noise

[Guitar solo]

[Chorus]
'Cause when we kiss, the world outside is gone
And whatever longing there is moves on
My heart doesn't have any choice
When I hear my name on your voice
Everything else, everything else is just noise
Everything else is just noise

[Verse 1]
People like you got nothin' better to do
Than throw rocks at things that shine
Well, you oughta be chasin' your own dreams
'Stead of shootin' holes in mine
Then again, keep it comin', keep your big mouth runnin'
Keep kickin' me while I'm down
Hop on the bandwagon, man, while you can
Better doubt me now

[Chorus]
Keep buildin' that chip up on my shoulder
Keep feedin' that monkey on my back
I can feel your hot air blowin' in colder
Stokin' this fire up under my ass
Got me livin' for the day, gonna see my face
Big as life and laughin' out loud
Lovin' all you haters
Beggin' you to doubt me now

[Verse 2]
Like a walk-on quarterback, a wannabe Cadillac
A backup to the third string
I'm outside the box, ain't got no shot
At the bullseye or the brass ring
Yeah, I heard it all, bet you thought I'd crawl
Under a rock and never wanna come out
But I'll never let you give me a reason
To doubt me now

[Chorus]
So keep buildin' that chip up on my shoulder
Keep feedin' that monkey on my back
I can feel your hot air blowin' in colder
Stokin' this fire up under my ass
Got me livin' for the day, gonna see my face
Big as life and laughin' out loud
Lovin' all you haters
Beggin' you to doubt me now
C'mon!

[Outro]
Yeah, keep buildin' that chip up on my shoulder
Keep feedin' that monkey on my back
I can feel your hot air blowin' in colder
Stokin' this fire up under my ass
Got me livin' for the day, gonna see my face
Big as life, last laughin' out loud
Lovin' all you haters
Beggin' you to doubt me now
Yeah, I love all you haters
Come on and doubt me now
Try and doubt me now
Hop on the bandwagon

[Intro]
One bull fight leads to another
If you gonna fight Billy
Gonna have to fight his brother

[Song]
Feelin' like Superman
Cold beer in my hand
I've been waitin' all week long
Johnny on the jukebox
Jenny in the shadowbox
Nothin' but her lipstick on
Shoot a little fireball
Shoot a little nine ball
Back against the back wall crowd
I don't need to smoke
But I'll take another toke
'Cause tonight I'm burnin' it down

Step right up, paid your little cover [?]
Try to out drink a bunch a redneck mothers
One Bud Light leads to another
If you're gonna fight Billy
Gonna have to fight his brother
Gonna fight Billy
Gonna have to fight his brother

Yonder come a plow boy
Trash talkin' cowboy
Actin' like he's ten feet tall
Billy's kissin' Ontrea
Hell, it's just the first date
Met her in the bathroom stall
Cat on a tin roof
Higher than the 90 proof
Howlin' like a bluetick hound
Steady as the beer flows
Everything in here goes
Circus done come to town

Yeah, step right up, paid your little cover
Try to out-drink a bunch a redneck mothers
One Bud Light leads to another
If you're gonna fight Billy
Gonna have to fight his brother
Gonna fight Billy
Gonna have to fight his brother

[Instrumental bridge]

Everything was goin' fine
'Till I hit the moonshine
Billy spilled a drink on me
Should'a known better
Hell, I knew better
But I rared back and took a swing

I said, step right up, paid your little cover
Try to out-drink a bunch a redneck mothers
One Bud Light leads to another
If you're gonna fight Billy
Gonna have to fight his brother
Gonna fight Billy
Gonna have to fight his brother

[Outro]
One bull fight leads to another
If you gonna fight Billy
Gonna have to fight his brother

The band was startin' Slow Hand
About the time you walked in
I could see it in your eyes
You were heart broke and needin' a friend
The singer started singin' as I let you have my bar stool
And before that first chorus was through

You were already smilin'
I said no use in tryin'
Open up a tab, oh girl I'm gladly buyin'
Ain't it funny thinkin' you were thinkin' you be drinkin' alone
Baby ain't it crazy what can happen in half a song

The second verse started
I asked you if you'd like to dance
When you said no I figured well there goes my chance
But the singer kept on singin'
And before he hit that chorus again
I felt you grab my hand
Then we bee-lined to the floor like we'd done this before
Holdin' onto you one, two, three four
Spinnin' and a gettin' in a rhythm, girl it didn't take long
Baby ain't it crazy what can happen in half a song

That song ended, said we've only got one more
Now we're half way through and we're still out here on the floor
Wonder what you're thinkin'
'Cause I think I'd like to drive you home
But I know that's probably never gonna happen
I'll just settle for your number on a napkin
Then again you never know what could happen in half a song
Half a song

[Verse 1]
You've always said that you'd love to live out here
Where you can smell the morning glories in the air
With that sun shining through that crystal blue
Sure looks good on you
Can't you just see a drive winding up that hill?
Leading to a house with flowers on the windowsill
It might take a while to clear this land
But I've got a plan

[Chorus 1]
Don't tell your mama yet, I'm begging you
Don't tell your daddy 'til the paperwork goes through
When the time is right we'll let 'em know
But right now is between you and me and these here fenceposts

[Verse 3]
Don't worry 'bout the money, got a couple things I can sell
And Mr. Folder down the road could always use some help
Whatever it takes, I'll go that extra mile
If it makes you smile

[Chorus 1]
So don't tell your mama yet, I'm begging you
Don't tell your daddy 'til the paperwork goes through
When the time is right we'll let 'em know
But right now is between you and me and these here fenceposts

[Instrumental Bridge]

[Chorus 2]
Ain't nobody 'round to see us now
What do ya say we lay a blanket down?
Anything that happens, baby, when we get this close
Stays between you and me and these here fenceposts

[Outro]
You've always said that you'd love to live out here

As I slide the key in the ignition of this ol' truck and fire it up
I'm struck hard by the heaviness of this situation
My eyes are fixed on the small silver half heart keychain you gave me dangling in the dashboard light
I read the word "forever" over and over again, I wanna cry

I turn off my radio as I turn off your county road
To pick you up just like I've done at least a thousand times
The gravel underneath these tires
Half mile stretch of ol barbed wire
Drops of rain fallin from the sky seem to know my pain
Know that I'm about to

Reach out to hold your hand in mine, feel your love baby one more time
Press against your lips and hold you tight, I know the next kiss is a kiss goodbye
I could put it off for another day act like everything's gonna be okay
It's gonna break my heart to see you cry
I know the next kiss is a kiss goodbye

See it's not that what I got to do is more important than you
It's just what I gotta do
And I know you don't understand, hell I don't understand myself

As I pull up to your house, I feel my head spinnin' around just thinkin' about how everything is about to change
Every step I take towards your door I'm a little less certain than the step before
Oh but I know, I know, I know what I gotta do

I got to reach out and hold your hand in mine, feel your love baby one more time
Press against your lips and hold you tight, I know the next kiss is a kiss goodbye
I could put it off for another day, act like everything's gonna be okay
It's gonna break my heart to see you cry
I know the next kiss is a kiss goodbye

Reach out and hold your hand in mine, feel your love baby one more time
Press against your lips and hold you tight
Yeah I could put it off for another day and act like everything's gonna be okay
It's gonna break my heart to see you cry
I know the next kiss is a kiss goodbye
Goodbye

Watching that clock
Tic-toc'ing on by
Had to talk myself
Out of up and quitting outright
But I heard that we were working late
I called my baby on my next break
She was a hot mess
She had a bad day
She took a deep breath
Next thing she had to say
Was honey I want you

Baby's blue
Yeah she needs me by her side
So blue
I can hear the tears in her eyes
Lord knows I need this job
There's bills to pay
But I'd walk away if I had to
Mm, baby's blue

Finally off work
Crank up my pick-up
Drive off like a madman
Cause she needs my love
Like a songbird needs a tune
I'll tell you just what I'm gonna do
I'm gonna
Wrap her up tight
Kiss the tears out of her eyes
Man I swear
If I hit another red light
I'm gonna drive on through
I'm gonna drive on through cause..

Baby's blue
Yeah she needs me by her side
So blue
I can hear the tears in her eyes
Lord knows I need that job
There's bills to pay
But I'd walk away if I had to
Mm, baby's blue

Oh, the kind of fire my baby's got
Always passed the point of red hot
It's blue
Cause she needs me by her side
So blue
I can hear the tears in her eyes
Lord knows I need that job
Cause there's bills to pay
But I'd walk away if I had to
Mm, baby's blue
My baby's blue

There ain't a pair of boots in my closet that ain't scuffed up and walked right through the soles
And there ain't a pair of jeans that ain't hanging on by the seams and full of holes
I ain't never been inside a three-piece suit. And my collar's just a worn out shade of blue
I try to beat the morning sun out of the bed
Man I work like hell til the sun goes down and then
I rest my head next to the most beautiful thing you've ever seen
Lord only knows what she means to me
Solid as the rock on her left hand
She's proud to be my woman, that's why I'm proud to be her man

She's flowers in her hair on Sunday morning
And she's a Bud Light in her hand on Friday night
She's cornbread in the oven
She's wild and crazy loving me just right
Oh you know that's right
She ain't afraid to put me in my place
She ain't afraid to love me every night so every day..

I try to beat the morning sun out of the bed
Man I work like hell til the sun goes down and then
I rest my head next to the most beautiful thing you've ever seen
Lord only knows what she means to me
Solid as the rock on her left hand
She's proud to be my woman, that's why I'm proud to be her man

She can rock a dress in cowboy boots, make a rolling stone wanna plant some roots
She's the one thing that I can't afford to lose

So I try to beat the morning sun out of the bed
Man I work like hell til the sun goes down and then
I rest my head next to the most beautiful thing you've ever seen
Lord only knows what she means to me
The reason I keep this ring on my left hand
She's proud to be my woman, that's why I'm proud to be her man
She's proud to be my woman, and that's why I'm proud to be her man

Colorado is too cold
The snow gets the best of me
Just laying there beside the fire place
Looks like where you otta be
And oklahoma is to rich
With american history
Its kind funny how it reminds me
Of all those books you use to read
And if i stay gone much longer
Might really go insane
Cause no matter where i go
Ill just be missing you in a texas kind of way
I keep seeing you in Houston
Down in matagorda Bay
And up on 6th street in Austin
At the rodeo in Santa Fe
MIGHT AS WELL JUST LOCK ME UP IN HUNTSVILLE
If your memories here to stay
Cause no matter where i go
Ill just be missing you in a texas kind of way
And new yorks got all them nights
Well its the city that never sleeps
Detroit can sure build me a fast car to try
And out run your memories
Montana skies go on for miles
Like the love you said you had for me
But if i keep writing all these sad songs
Might as well just stay in tenessee
And i keep seein you in Houston
Down at matagorda bay
And up on 6th street in Austin
At the rodeo in Santa Fe
MIGHT AS WELL JUST LOCK ME UP IN HUNTSVILLE
If your memories is here to stay
Cause no matter where i go
Ill just be missin you in a texas kind of way
Here we go
And I'll keep seeing you in Houston
And down at matagorda bay
And up on 6th street in Austin
At the rodeo in santa fe
MIGHT AS WELL JUST LOCK ME UP IN HUNTSVILLE
If your memories here to stay
Cause no matter where i go
Ill just be missing you in a Texas kind of way
Oohhh no matter where i go
Ill just be missin you in a texas kind of way

I woke up this mornin' with a feelin' in my head
I'd been out all night drinkin'
I was feelin' 'bout half past dead
But when I rolled over and I saw your eyes
I didn't feel as bad as I thought
It's amazin', it's amazin'
What you do for me

I know I dont always do things right
There's plenty of places I lack
I leave the shower curtain pulled back
And my dirty dishes on the rack
Lord you stare at me in disgust
But you look so cute that I laugh
It's amazin', it's amazin'
What you do for me

And it's amazin' when you speak my knees get weak
And it's amazin' when you cry it's my comfort that you seek
And it's amazin' when I'm down it doesnt matter
What you say to me
You bring me up again Lord it's amazin'
What you do for me

You come home from work and you had a bad day
And you say you hate the world
It's times like these all i wanna do
Is wrap my arms around you girl
All my cares go out the window
All I can think about is you
It's amazin', it's amazin'
What you do for me

And it's amazin' when you speak my knees get weak
And it's amazin' when you cry it's my comfort that you seek
And it's amazin' when I'm down it doesnt matter
What you say to me
You bring me up again Lord it's amazin'
What you do for me
What you do for me
Girl its amazin'

There's a door
Where the sign says "do not enter"
But enter
Do I still
But there's a table
That holds a bottle and a Bible
A welcome sign
To a hopeful sinner

There are voices
Tellin' me to swallow my pain
And there's an angel
Tellin' me to accept the blame

And there's a light
Bein' drowned out by the darkness
I've created
In my soul
And there's a hand
It's reachin' out from the Bible
Tryin' to save me
From what I might become

'Cause there are voices
Tellin' me to swallow my pain
And there's an angel
Tellin' me to accept the blame

There's a man
And he's the keeper of that bottle
He's got prisoners
I know I'm one
But there's a hope
In the keeper of that Bible
That he might win
This battle of my soul

'Cause I am broken
And I am weary
The path before me
Can't be seen clearly

'Cause there are voices
Tellin' me to swallow my pain
And there's an angel
Tellin' me to accept the blame

I ain't going nowhere baby
Rest your worries somewhere else
High up on a self now baby
Next to all your other doubts
Things have been real crazy lately
But I ain't going nowhere baby

If you need to cry girl here's a shoulder
Sometimes I feel like crying too
Every day I'm getting older
But that don't change this thing I've got for you
You're the only thing that saves me
So I ain't going nowhere baby

The radio's full of them good love songs
Can't hold a candle to a love this strong
It goes on and on, keeps getting stronger
Yeah, every time you lie next to me
It still feels like I'm 17
Nothing turns me on, the way you turn me on

I ain't going nowhere baby
I cancelled all your plans today
We both need some healing baby
Yeah, take my hand and I'll lead the way
Let's lock the door and love like crazy
Cause I ain't going nowhere baby

Yeah, the radio's full of them good love songs
Can't hold a candle to a love this strong
It goes on and on, keeps getting stronger
Yeah, every time you lie next to me
It still feels like I'm 17
Nothing turns me on, the way you turn me on

I ain't going nowhere baby
Girl I'm right where I belong
Tangled up in love here, baby
Soaking up this high I'm on
It don't matter where life takes me
I ain't going nowhere baby

[Verse 1]
There's a dusty hat up on the dash of every truck you meet
Country roads and fenceposts as far as you can see
Billboard sign says, "Rodeo, June eleven through thirteen"
When you get to town just look around for the Rusty Nail Cafe
Where the old hands sip their coffee and relive their glory days
A modern day Charlie Russell scene
Where cowboys are king

[Chorus]
I get back there every now and then
Turn a few steers in the roping pen
Just a couple of days and I'm gone again
Chasin' this old six string
Oh, but I sure love to be
Where cowboys are king

[Verse 2]
Runs the horses down, turn 'em out, head over to the bar
There'll be George Strait on the jukebox, and I'll bet the chances are
There'll be some cowgirls in well-worn jeans
Where cowboys are king

[Chorus]
I get back there every now and then
Turn a few steers in the roping pen
Just a couple of days and I'm gone again
Chasin' this old six string
Oh, but I sure love to be
Where cowboys are king

[Refrain]
Boys, as bad as I wish I could stay
I just hope this never goes away

[Outro]
So I can get back here every now and then
Turn a few steers in the roping pen
Spend a little time with some good old friends
Y'all make it so hard to leave
Oh, but I sure love to be
Where cowboys are king
Oh, and I sure love to be
Where cowboys are king

I wish that my Grandad was still here today cause' I'd love to here what he'd have to say about three dollars and fifty-nine cents
For a gallon of gas. And I'd show him my wife and what I've done with my life, and see if he liked all these songs that I write
Oh, I wish I knew what he would think about the fact that, if you're sixteen and pregnant, you'll get on tv, but yet we're laying
Off school teachers fast as can be
Oh, I wish I knew what he'd think about us now

(Chorus)
He'd probably ask me why the good ole' US of A is so damn tied up in our foreign aid when the American farmers got to sell all the
Cows to keep the bank from taking the house. I wish I could write him in on my ballot for the next president. Cause' there's men like
John Wayne, Augustus McCrae, the Lone Ranger and his indian friend, but there will never be another man like him
I'm glad that I'm not some big Hollywood star who thinks they have the right to go as far as bitching about the hundred million
Dollars they make a year. Cause' there's scars on my nuckles and sweat on my brow and I know that Grandpa, he'd sure be proud of my
Little part that I've made to our family tree
He'd probably ask me why people like Casey Anthony can get off scott free and why our taxes are still killing folks just like you
And me. Oh I wish I knew what he'd think about us now

(Chorus)
He'd probably ask me why the good ole' US of A is so damn tied up in our foreign aid, when the American farmers got to sell all the
Cows to keep the bank from taking the house. I wish I could write him in on my ballot for the next president. Cause' there's men like
John Wayne, Augustus McCrae, the Lone Ranger and his indian friend, but there will never be another man like him
Yeah, there's men like John Wayne, Augustus McCrae, the Lone Ranger and his indian friend, but there will never be another man like
Him

I wish I'd been born in a different day, with cowboys like old Gus McCrae. I'd just saddle up and ride away. I wish I'd been born in
A different day
Well, I wish I could've lived in a different time, when Willie and Waylon walked the line. It's an era long gone and it seems a
Crime. I wish I could've lived in a different time

(Chorus)
Well, I'm stuck out here in no man's land. Just an ace of spades in a diamond flush hand. I still do the best I can to fit in, but
Time it ain't ever really been my friend
Well I wish you could've seen me in a different light. I wish I could've been your shining knight, but i'll always be a friend in
Your eyes. Well, I wish you could've seen me in a different light

(Chorus)
And now I'm stuck out here in no man's land. I'm just an ace of spades in a diamond flush hand. I still do the best I can to fit in
But time it ain't ever really been my friend
Well I wish I'd been born in a different day, with cowboys like old Gus McCrae, and I'd have just saddled up and rode away. I wish
I'd been born in a different day

I'm a long country mile from bein' in style
Dirty hat and cowboy boots
I cut my teeth on them old outlaw songs
My daddy used to listen to
Guess it's in my genes
I gotta be me

Yeah I say what I think
But sometimes I drink
And when I do, I drink too much
Wind up on my back
Eye shinin' black
And I know it's all because bad as it might be
Hey, I gotta be me

You can wind me up an dine me
You can polish up and shine me
But the real thing's gonna shine through
It ain't always pretty, but the cowboy in me
Couldn't change if he wanted to

Yeah, I had a girl her name was Pearl
I think she's up in Arkansas
She raised her voice and gave me a choice
'Tween singin' in a Honkeytonk or a J-O-B
As you can see, I gotta be me

Yeah, you can wine me up and dine me
You can polish up an shine me
But the real things gonna shine through
It ain't always pretty but the cowboy in me
Couldn't change if he wanted to

[Verse 1]
People say I ain't no good
And I'm crazy as a loon
'Cause I get stoned in the morning
I get drunk in the afternoon
I'm kinda like my old blue tick hound
I like to lay around in the shade
I ain't got no money
But I damn sure got it made

[Chorus]
And I ain't asking nobody for nothin'
If I can't get it on my own
If you don't like the way I'm livin'
Just leave this long haired country boy alone

[Verse 2]
Well I've seen a preacher man talking on TV
He was puttin' down rock 'n' roll
He wants me to send a donation
'Cause he's worried about my soul
He said Jesus walked on the water
And y'all know this is true
Well sometimes I think that old preacher man
Should like to do a little walking too

[Chorus]
'Cause I ain't asking nobody for nothin'
Yeah, if I can't get it on my own
Yeah, if you don't like the way I'm livin'
Just leave this long haired country boy alone
Oh, here it goes

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
Well I said the poor girl wants to marry
And the rich girl wants to flirt
The rich boys went off to college
And all of us poor boys came to work
The drunkard wants another drink of wine
And the politician wants your vote
But me, I don't want much of nothin' at all
But I will take another toke

[Chorus]
'Cause I ain't asking nobody for nothin'
Yeah, if I can't get it on my own
Yeah, if you don't like the way I'm livin'
Just leave this long haired country boy alone
Well I said, I said
If you don't like how I'm livin'
Just leave this long haired country boy alone

[Outro]
Get 'em boys

[Verse 1]
Woman left me with the blues
And I know just how I got 'em
I see a fifth of Jimmy Beam
I'm gonna drink it to the bottom
I ain't tryna hurt nobody
I ain't prone to give a damn
I got me nothin' left to lose
I'm in a honky-tonk mood

[Chorus]
I'm in a honky-tonk mood
That's where I'll be all night
If anybody's lookin' for me
Look for a neon light, oh
I'm playin' here tonight
And then I'm playin' here tomorrow
I got a whiskey and a tune
I'm in a honky-tonk mood

[Verse 2]
If I get to gettin' loud
Don't you worry 'bout it, boys
'Cause gettin' over this heartache
Is gonna make a little noise
If I start to dancin' 'round
Don't try and pull me off the floor
I'm just a-kickin' up my boots
I'm in a honky-tonk mood

[Chorus]
I'm in a honky-tonk mood
That's where I'll be all night
If anybody's lookin' for me
Look for a neon light, oh
I'm playin' here tonight
And then I'm playin' here tomorrow
I got a whiskey and a tune
I'm in a honky-tonk mood
I got a whiskey and a tune
I'm in a honky-tonk mood

I rode a horse named Whiskey, I thought I could trust
'Til she pinned her ears back
And just like a whip crack she left me in the dust
I was cruisin' on my Harley, enjoyin' the breeze
I got hit head on and thrown, lord knows it should've killed me

Every scar has a story, and it leaves its mark
Guess you could say I'm the king of takin' things way too far
I thought I knew pain, ain't nothin' I ain't been through
But when I met you, girl, I fell hard
Every scar has a story, just ask my heart

I remember that mornin', I saw your face
Turnin' down a side street
Somethin' inside me said don't let her get away
And those nights that followed, they still haunt me
Cause they were some of the best
I'll never forget how good it used to be

Every scar has a story, and it leaves its mark
Guess you could say I'm the king of takin' things way too far
I thought I knew pain, ain't nothin' I ain't been through
But when I met you, girl, I fell hard
Every scar has a story, just ask my heart

They say old wounds heal with time and they get better
But the hurts you left on me will last forever

Every scar has a story, and it leaves its mark
Guess you could say I'm the king of takin' things way too far
I thought I knew pain ain't nothin' I ain't been through
But when I met you, girl, I fell hard
Every scar has a story, just ask my heart
Every scar has a story, just ask my heart
Just ask my heart

[Verse 1]
Some people don't know when to quit, and that's why they quit
Some need to hit the bottom to see they got a problem, they can't handle it
But that ain't why I started cleaning up my life
Wish it was, but, ooh, that would be a lie

[Chorus]
I've been sober 'cause there ain't no hangover like you, girl
No, no, no
Baby, can you come over?
I always find those words at the bottom of a hundred proof, yeah
Girl, every time you do
I just end up, head all messed up like the sheets where we made love
I've been sober since you broke my heart in two
'Cause drunk me can't get over you (There ain't no hangover like you)
Can't get over, can't get over (There ain't no hangover like you)
Oh, no, no, no

[Verse 2]
All those bottles sitting up on the shelf are just salt on the wound
One sip and I'm picking up the phone tryin' not to go home without you
And that ain't nothin' but a whole lotta pain
And that kind of hurt, ooh hurts, it ain't worth another drink

[Chorus]
I've been sober 'cause there ain't no hangover like you, girl
No, no, no
Baby, can you come over?
I always find those words at the bottom of a hundred proof, yeah
Girl, every time you do
I just end up, head all messed up like the sheets where we made love
I've been sober since you broke my heart in two
'Cause drunk me can't get over you, no
Can't get over you, oh, no, no, no
I've been sober 'cause there ain't no hangover like you, no, no, no

Can you come over?
I always find those words at the bottom of a hundred proof, yeah
Girl, every time you do
I just end up, head all messed up like the sheets where we made love
I've been sober since you broke my heart in two
'Cause drunk me, yeah drunk me, yeah drunk me
Can't get over you, no (there ain't no hangover like you)
Can't get over, can't get over
(There ain't no hangover like you), oh, no, no, no

[Verse 1]
My daddy always told me to be aware of my surroundings
Yeah, I got eyes all over this town
Yeah, you got caught kissing another guitar-picking bro
Says you're the one he's singing about

[Chorus]
Well, I don't deal with bitches no more
Yeah, I don't deal with bitches no more
I could call you crazy, curse your name
Throw your shit out the door
But I don't deal with bitches no more

[Verse 2]
Hold up, hey, I still believe in love
But not the kind you're making with every guy in this pub
No one to blame but myself
I should've known you were with someone else
When I watched you give that "just a friend" a hug

[Chorus]
Well, I don't deal with bitches no more
Yeah, I don't deal with bitches no more
I could call you crazy, curse your name
Throw your shit out the door
But I don't deal with bitches no more, yeah

[Post-Chorus]
No, I don't deal with bitches no more
No, no, no bitches (I ain't got no time)
No, no, no bitches
Oh, no, no, no bitches no more, yeah

[Bridge]
I hope that it was worth it
Your reputation, you earned it
You're the best damn deal in town, oh, so cheap
Now I love this peace and quiet
No lying, cheating, fighting
Just me, myself, and these guitar strings

[Chorus]
Well, I don't deal with bitches no more (I don't deal with bitches)
Yeah, I don't deal with bitches no more
(I don't deal with bitches no more)
I could call you crazy, curse your name (I could call you crazy)
Throw your shit out the door (Throw your shit out the door)
But I don't deal with bitches no more (No, no bitches no more)
No, I won't deal with bitches no more (I don't deal with bitches)
No, I don't deal with bitches anymore
I just don't

[Post-Chorus]
No, no, no bitches (Got no time)
No, no, no bitches
Oh, no, no, no bitches no more
I don't deal with bitches no more
(I don't deal with bitches no more)
No, no, no bitches (I could call you crazy)
No, no, no bitches
Oh, no, no, no bitches no more (Don't you say nothin' more)
No, no, no bitches (No more)
No, no, no bitches (No more)
Oh, no, no, no bitches no more (No, I don't deal with bitches)
No, no, no bitches
No, no, no bitches

[Verse 1]
Number one on my speed dial
I changed her name so my friends won't find out
But they're all headin' home now
And I got word that she's hangin' downtown
I know I shouldn't do it
Oh, but these shots I'm shootin' make me not give a damn

[Chorus]
And now it's one more last time, we swore we wouldn't
But it's one more sunrise breaking through these curtains
And I know when we're sober, we'll both say, "It's over"
But it ain't really over
'Cause alcohol, alcohol, alcohol you later
Alcohol, alcohol, alcohol you later

[Verse 2]
Two-for-Ones on a Tuesday
Bartender poured 'em too strong 'cause he knows me
Then I take out my phone, find out if she's at home
'Cause I need someone to drink with

[Chorus]
And now it's one more last time, we swore we wouldn't
But it's one more sunrise breaking through these curtains
And I know when we're sober, we'll both say, "It's over"
But it ain't really over
'Cause alcohol, alcohol, alcohol you later
Alcohol, alcohol, alcohol you later

[Bridge]
I know I shouldn't do it
Oh, but these shots I'm shootin' make me not give a damn

[Chorus]
And now it's one more last time, we swore we wouldn't
But it's one more sunrise breaking through these curtains
And I know when we're sober, we'll both say, "It's over"
But it ain't really over
'Cause alcohol, alcohol, alcohol you later
Alcohol, alcohol, alcohol you later
'Cause alcohol, alcohol, alcohol you later
Alcohol, alcohol, alcohol you later
'Cause alcohol, alcohol, alcohol you later
Alcohol, alcohol, alcohol you later

[Verse 1]
She said, "Baby, tell me somethin'
You ain't never told no one before," oh yeah
Let's do some demolition
I'll just sit and listen while we break down this wall
I want the good, the bad, the hurt you had
I want your crazy
Unfold your soul
I wanna know everythin', baby

[Chorus]
Girl, you got me tellin' all my secrets
Promise me you'll keep 'em
And I'll let 'em loose
Baby, you must be my weakness
Usually, I'm speechless
Bulletproof, oh yeah
Well girl, you got me tellin' all my secrets
Tellin' all my secrets to you

[Post-Chorus]
La-da-da dap-pa, yeah
La-da-da dap-don, yeah
Yeah, oh-oh-oh

[Verse 2]
Baby, come a little closer
I'm gon' need to hold you
When I tell you this
Baby, kiss you with a whisper
Let me paint you a picture
With my fingertips
Oh girl, you got me changin' things
All my friends think that I'm crazy
But all of me has come to be
In love with you, baby

[Chorus]
Got me tellin' all my secrets
Promise me you'll keep 'em
And I'll let 'em loose
Baby, you must be my weakness
Usually, I'm speechless
Bulletproof, oh yeah
Well girl, you got me tellin' all my secrets
Tellin' all my secrets to you

[Post-Chorus]
La-yeah hey
Oh-whoa-oh

[Bridge]
Well, here's to the good, the bad
All I have
I love you like crazy
Well, all the messy, all the sexy
All of me, baby

[Chorus]
Tellin' all my secrets, oh
Promise me you'll keep 'em
And I'll let 'em loose
Oh, I'll let 'em loose
Baby, you must be my weakness
Usually, I'm speechless
And bulletproof, oh-oh
Well, girl, you got me tellin' all my secrets
Tellin' all my secrets to you

[Outro]
Oh, yeah
Oh, I'm tellin' 'em all
Oh, baby, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, yeah
Oh, oh, oh, oh yeah, yeah
Ooh girl
Girl, you look so good
I will let them know, girl
Ooh, I'ma let 'em know, yeah

[Verse 1]
She says she likes to dance
She loves to make friends with my friends
She don't give a damn what anyone thinks when
She says she's gonna maybe wanna
Get drunk get waffles at two in the morning
If she want it yeah she got it
Cause she got me like that

[Chorus]
I would wreck all of my plans
Drive until we hit the sands
Catch sunburn while she tans
I would do, I would do
I'd do whatever she likes
Give her Christmas in July
She ain't gotta tell me twice
I would do, I would do anything

[Verse 2]
She says she likes it when I hold her hand while they're
Watching yeah, all eyes on us
She got all my attention
She knows I'm always listening
Hanging off her lips yeah
Cause she got me like that

[Chorus]
I would wreck all of my plans
Drive until we hit the sands
Catch a sunburn while she tans
I would do, I would do
I'd do whatever she likes
Give her Christmas in July
She ain't gotta tell me twice
I would do, I would do anything

Oh anything she says
Oh, anything she says

[Bridge]
I would up and take a chance
Have a talk with her old man
Put a diamond on her hand
I would do, I'd do anything yeah

[Chorus]
I would wreck all of my plans
Drive until we hit the sands
Catch a sunburn while she tans
I would do, I would do
I'd do whatever she likes
Give her Christmas in July
She ain't gotta tell me twice
I would do, I would do anything

[Outro]
Oh anything she says
Anything she says
She says
Just tell me what to do
Just tell me what to do

[Verse 1]
She orders up another one
'Cause who's counting anyway
Won't stop till the job is done
She's gotta forget his name
Every sip on her lips is going down so slow
Like the tears falling off her face
Bartender knows better than to cut her off
It's his job to fix heartbreak
She don't even like the taste

[Chorus]
But she's throwin' them back
Raising the glass
Saying goodbye to the past 'cause it's over
Clearing her mind two at a time
Little more vodka with a little less soda
Knows it ain't right, just for tonight
It's gonna be her way of dealing
She has mixed feelings about her drinking
Mixed drinks about her feelings

[Verse 2]
Every time her phone lights up
She pretends she doesn't see
'Cause she don't even need to look
She knows who's on the screen
They say drunken minds fix a sober heart
When it's torn apart 'cause it went too far
Lord knows she must be hurting
'Cause she hasn't said a word

[Chorus]
But she's throwin' them back
Raising the glass
Saying goodbye to the past 'cause it's over
Clearing her mind two at a time
Little more vodka with a little less soda
Knows it ain't right, just for tonight
It's gonna be her way of dealing
She has mixed feelings about her drinking
Mixed drinks about her feelings, yeah

[Bridge]
She don't even like the taste
But she won't let it go to waste

[Chorus]
Yeah, she's throwin' them back
Raising the glass
Saying goodbye to the past 'cause it's over
Clearing her mind two at a time
Little more vodka with a little less soda
Knows it ain't right, just for tonight
It's gonna be her way of dealing
She has mixed feelings about her drinking
Mixed drinks about her feelings

(What's a couple mixed drinks?)
(A couple mixed drinks?)
(What's a couple mixed drinks?)
(A couple mixed drinks?)

[Outro]
I know what you want
(A couple mixed drinks)
I know what you need
(What's a couple mixed drinks?)
I could finish your problem right now
(Yeah, a couple mixed drinks)
Let me buy you a drink
(What's a couple mixed drinks?)
Let me buy you a drink
(Yeah, a couple mixed drinks)
Let me buy you a drink
(What's a couple mixed drinks?)
I could finish your problem
(Yeah, a couple mixed drinks)
I can make you forget him
(What's a couple mixed drinks?)

[Intro]
Walk like him
Walk like him
Mmm, yeah

[Verse 1]
Mama says I walk like him, feet at 10 and two
My uncle says I talk like him, I get my point across the room
And if he were here today, he'd just laugh out loud when they say
'Cause he knew that his boy was just like him

[Chorus 1]
So I cuss a little bit when the game's on TV
Got Eagles in the truck on repeat
Know how to use a hammer and nail
Don't whine about my problems
He was better at puttin' that bottle down
But I spend every day tryna make him proud
If I said that I didn't, I'd be lying
But I'm tryin' to walk like him

[Verse 2]
Papa said I'm stubborn like him, and I guess that he would know
My daddy got it from him, and I make three in a row
Well, ain't that how it goes? A bloodline keeping him alive
One day, my babies'll look at me and see what he was like

[Chorus 1]
So I cuss a little bit when the game's on TV
Got Eagles in the truck on repeat
Know how to use a hammer and nail
Don't whine about my problems
He was better at puttin' that bottle down
But I spend every day tryna make him proud
If I said that I didn't, I'd be lying
But I'm tryin' to walk like him
Oh, walk like him (Walk like him)

[Bridge]
I remember when he sat me down and told me he was sick
Said, "Son, don't worry 'bout me, you've got your life to live"
He started talking to God again
It'd been a while, like old friends
And when the time came for him, I know where he went

[Chorus 2]
So I pray a little more today than I used to
Call Mama every day like he said to
Know how to treat a woman right and how to live a life
He was better at puttin' that bottle down
But I spend every day tryna make him proud
If I said that I didn't, I'd be lying
But I'll keep tryin' to walk like him
Oh, walk like him, yeah (Walk like him)

[Outro]
Mama says I walk like him, feet at 10 and two

[Verse 1]
I've been drinking more wine instead of tequila
Staying in at home instead of swiping my Visa
Ain't running up a tab on a Tuesday night
And calling up a cab in the morning light
Been finding some things I didn't know about me
Every wall fell down around me
I didn't go looking, no, it just found me
What happened to me 'cause this is the new me

[Chorus]
Somebody's got me all f***** up
Like I'm three drinks in and the room is spinning
Somebody's got me calling up my mama
A little nervous, saying that I'm falling
Somebody's got me in the palm of their hand
Like the story was written, all part of God's plan
Got my back, got my soul, got my heart on my sleeve
'Cause somebody's got me, somebody's got me, somebody's got me
Somebody's got me, somebody's got me, somebody's got me

[Verse 2]
Is this how it feels to be a man?
When I wake up with her, wanna do it again
Making sure she feels safe in my arms
Fighting for the flame when you're feeling that spark
Sharing the covers to sharing the closet
Catching my breath right after I lost it
From her walking in to the dress that she's dropping
Whatever she wants, oh, she's got it, yeah yeah

[Chorus]
Somebody's got me all f***** up
Like I'm three drinks in and the room is spinning
Somebody's got me calling up my mama
A little nervous, saying that I'm falling
Somebody's got me in the palm of their hand
Like the story was written, all part of God's plan
Got my back, got my soul, got my heart on my sleeve
Oh, somebody's got me, yeah
Oh, somebody's got me, mmm

[Chorus]
Somebody's got me all f***** up
Like I'm three drinks in and the room is spinning
Somebody's got me calling up my mama
A little nervous, saying that I'm falling
Somebody's got me in the palm of their hand
Like the story was written, all part of God's plan
Got my back, got my soul, got my heart on my sleeve
Oh, somebody's got me
(Somebody's got, somebody's got, somebody's got me)
Oh yeah, somebody's got me, yeah yeah
(Somebody's got, somebody's got, somebody's got me)

[Outro]
Oh, somebody's got me
Oh, somebody's got me, mmm

[Verse 1]
You say you miss me
'Cause he ain't like me
And I try to play it cool
Ask what you been up to
But I know what you've been up to
I been up to the same thing
Been tryin' to forget you
You been tryin' to forget me

[Chorus]
Why can't I fall in love with her like I fell for you
Why do I feel like I'm lyin' every time I tell the truth
Why do we restart every time we are
Tryin' to move on, girl, it's so hard
When you call me, your friend saw me
With somebody that ain't- and somebody ain't you
That somebody (Somebody)
Somebody ain't you
That somebody (Somebody)
Somebody ain't you

[Verse 2]
You the one that she knows about
Why I get it, go around
I guess it's just how it goes now
'Cause you're the one that we fight about

[Chorus]
Why can't I fall in love with her like I fell for you
Why do I feel like I'm lyin' every time I tell the truth
Why do we restart every time we are
Tryin' to move on, girl, it's so hard
When you call me, your friend saw me
With somebody that ain't- and somebody ain't you
Somebody ain't you

Why can't I fall in love with her like I fell for you
Why do I feel like I'm lyin' every time I tell the truth
Why do we restart every time we are
Tryin' to move on, girl, it's so hard
When you call me, your friend saw me
With somebody that ain't- and somebody ain't you

[Outro]
Yeah, uh-ohh
Somebody ain't you
Yeah
Somebody ain't you, oh
Ohh-oh-ohh

[Verse 1]
She had faded red paint on her windshield
Said, "Zero dollars down, come make a deal"
Passed by it every day 'til I couldn't pass it up no more
Rockin' three Goodyears and a Michelin
A tailgate hangin’ on by a thread
With an old V8 knock-knockin’ on heaven’s door

[Pre-Chorus]
Lord knows it wasn’t perfect
But every yard I cut to earn it was worth it

[Chorus]
Hell yeah, those were the good days
Driving by my own rules
Well, I crowned myself the king of the highway
Man, I never felt more cool, yeah, it's true, oh
They say ain’t nothin’ like the first time (Hell nah)
And it was love at first drive
Yeah, I owned that road in that rusty gold
Old truck I drove in high school

[Verse 2]
Always playin' chicken with the "Check Engine" light
Slipped a twenty dollar bill to the emission guy
Got her shined up good for that game every Friday night

[Pre-Chorus]
Lord knows it wasn’t perfect (Not even close)
But I was happy it was workin' (Workin')

[Chorus]
Hell yeah, those were the good days
Driving by my own rules
Well, I crowned myself the king of the highway
Man, I never felt more cool, yeah, it's true, oh
They say ain’t nothin’ like the first time (Hell nah)
And it was love at first drive
Yeah, I owned that road in that rusty gold
Old truck I drove in high school, yeah
(That truck I drove)

[Bridge]
I kinda wonder where she’s at these days
I bet she runnin’ like nothin's changed
Duct tape, zip ties, static on the radio
Calvin on the back, pissin' on 24

[Chorus]
Hell yeah, those were the good days
Driving by my own rules (Oh, my own rules)
Well, I crowned myself the king of the highway (Ha, ha)
Man, I never felt more cool, yeah, it's true (I never felt more cool, yeah)
They say ain’t nothin’ like the first time (Hell nah)
And it was love at first drive
Yeah, I owned that road in that rusty gold
Old truck I drove in high school (Ah yeah)

[Outro]
I kinda wonder where she’s at these days
I kinda wonder where she’s at these days
I kinda wonder where she’s at these days
I kinda wonder, I kinda wonder
I kinda wonder where she’s at these days
(Yeah, that truck I drove, yeah, that truck I drove)
I kinda wonder where she’s at these days
(Yeah, that truck I drove, yeah, that truck I drove)
I kinda wonder where she’s at these days
(Yeah, that truck I drove, yeah, that truck I drove)
I kinda wonder, I kinda wonder
(Yeah, that truck I drove, yeah, that truck I drove)

[Verse 1]
Every once in a while when you're drunk
And you dial up my number and try
Girl, don't even apologize
'Cause now that you're gone
I moved up, I moved on
And I'm never, never gonna go and fall back on you

[Chorus]
Every weekend, I blew off my best friends
You had my attention, it was all on you
Every feeling I used to feel when my hands were full
'Cause they were all on you
So when it's late and you're laying there missing me
Wishing you're kissing me, saying you're pissed at me
Girl, it's all on you
If you show up and you knock on my door
And it's 4 in the morning, it's raining, it's pouring
I'm gonna say we're through
And it's all on you, you, you, you, you, you, you
Girl, it's all on you, you, you, you, all on you

[Verse 2]
Yeah, I hope that you know that I tried and I tried and I tried
To revive something that already died
And I learned how to forgive, let shit go, water under the bridge
So you can save your breath, don't even apologize

[Chorus]
Every weekend, I blew off my best friends
You had my attention, it was all on you
Every feeling I used to feel when my hands were full
'Cause they were all on you
So when it's late and you're laying there missing me
Wishing you're kissing me, saying you're pissed at me
Girl, it's all on you
If you show up and you knock on my door
And it's 4 in the morning, it's raining, it's pouring
I'm gonna say we're through
And it's all on you, you, you, you, all on you (Oh, it's all on you)
Yeah, it's all on you, you, you, you, all on you

[Bridge]
(It was all on you)
You had all my attention
(It was all on you)
It was every weekend
(It was all on you)
Wish I wouldn't have spent them all on you (All on you)

[Chorus]
Every weekend, I blew off my best friends
You had my attention, it was all on you (All on you)
Every feeling I used to feel when my hands were full
'Cause they were all on you (All on you)
So when it's late and you're laying there missing me
Wishing you're kissing me, saying you're pissed at me
Girl, it's all on you (All on you)
If you show up and you knock on my door
And it's 4 in the morning, it's raining, it's pouring
I'm gonna say we're through (All on you)
Yeah, it's all on you, you, you, you, you, you, you
Girl, it's all on you (All on you)
Yeah, it's all on you, you, you, you, all on you, woo

[Outro]
All on you
All on you

[Intro]
Oh, I'm a goner
Oh, I'm a goner

[Verse 1]
I mix up a Crown and Coke, she slips on a red dress
Putting on a little show, zipping up slow-mo
Going straight to my head
She giving me déjà vu, and I got a feeling
This is one of those more-to-come-where-that-came-from kinda evenings

[Chorus]
I'm like, good Lord, have mercy, take me home
I don't stand a chance
She's a red-hot, don't stop, already know
She'll be my last dance
She's a full tank, floorboard, foot on the gas
Fire it up, I'm never gonna look back
Oh yeah, she's my Madonna, she's all I wanna
So good it hurts, one look at her, and I'm a goner
Oh, I'm a goner
Oh, I'm a goner

[Verse 2]
She burns through the bedroom, glides across the carpet
Leaving little footprints of perfume hints
I'm locked in, can't stop watching
The things she does, the way she moves her body, yeah
I feel the rush, can't help but want it on me
(Can't help but want it, yeah)

[Chorus]
I'm like, good Lord, have mercy, take me home
I don't stand a chance
She's a red-hot, don't stop, already know
She'll be my last dance
She's a full tank, floorboard, foot on the gas
Fire it up, I'm never gonna look back
Oh yeah, she's my Madonna, she's all I wanna
So good it hurts, one look at her, and I'm a goner

[Post-Chorus]
I'm gone, oh
I'm a gone, said I'm a goner
I'm a gone, I'm a goner

[Bridge]
Oh, I'm a goner
Oh, I'm a goner
The things she does, the way she moves her body (Oh, I'm a goner)
I feel the rush, can't help but want it on me (Oh, I'm a goner)

[Chorus]
I'm like, good Lord, have mercy, take me home (Take me home)
I don't stand a chance
She's a red-hot, don't stop, already know (Already know)
She'll be my last dance
She's a full tank, floorboard, foot on the gas
Fire it up, I'm never gonna look back
Oh yeah, she's my Madonna, she's all I wanna
So good it hurts, one look at her, and I'm a goner

[Outro]
Oh, girl, you know I don't stand a chance (Oh, I'm a goner)
But you know what you're doing (Oh, I'm a goner)
Mmm, girl I love to look at you (Oh, I'm a goner)
When you walk out of the bedroom
And get back to, and get back to— (Oh, I'm a goner)
Oh, I'm a goner
Oh, I'm a goner

[Verse 1]
It's like you wanted me to really feel that heartbreak
Like you knew I'd see the writing on your wall
And if a picture's worth a thousand words, baby
You just said it all
It's like you want the whole wide world to see you're happy
Like you need to prove to me that you moved on
And while I'm burning every real one that you left me
This one won't get gone

[Pre-Chorus]
Now I finally understand

[Chorus]
The way you're holding onto that man
You couldn't fit a grain of sand between you
Yeah, girl, I see you
I see he bought your favorite drink, that Sex On the Beach
The way you used to smile at me, he gets you
And I get the picture, I get the picture
Ooh yeah, I get the picture

[Verse 2]
It's like you wanted me to tear this town up drinking
Like you're begging me to take some new girl home
Yeah, you might as well have poured the shots
'Cause the shot of you and him is just as strong
And it's hanging on

[Chorus]
Like the way you're holding onto that man
You couldn't fit a grain of sand between you
Yeah, girl, I see you
I see he bought your favorite drink, that Sex On the Beach
The way you used to smile at me, he gets you
And I get the picture, I get the picture
Ooh yeah, I get the picture

[Bridge]
Now I finally understand
That you and me will never be you and me again

[Chorus]
The way you're holding onto that man
You couldn't fit a grain of sand between you
Yeah, girl, I see you
I see he bought your favorite drink, that Sex On the Beach
The way you used to smile at me, he gets you
And I get the picture, oh, I get the picture
Oh, I get the picture

[Outro]
Oh, I get the picture, oh, I get the picture, oh, I get the picture
Oh, I get the picture, oh, I get the picture, oh, I get the picture

[Verse 1]
It's the kinda thing that makes you forget everything at a party
Got me taking shots I don't take, but she likes Bacardi
She gonna steal your attention
Make you want more than a friendship
When you try to play it cool
But you know she can hear your heartbeat

[Chorus]
You're standing out from everybody
Got my mind drunk, going crazy
Got me lookin' ahead at things
Seein' some better days, callin' it "our place"
Don't care if you break it, it's a chance worth taking

[Verse 2]
I'm gonna throw it out there
You can catch it in the air or you can drop it
But something's telling me to tell you that I could be falling
No, I didn't expect this, I planned to show up and be reckless
But now I'm being careful, making sure every word I say is perfect

[Chorus]
You're standing out from everybody
Got my mind drunk, going crazy
Got me lookin' ahead at things
Seein' some better days, callin' it "our place"
Don't care if you break it, it's a chance worth taking

[Post-Chorus]
It's a chance worth taking
It's a chance, it's a chance

[Bridge]
It's a chance worth taking (It's a chance)
It's a chance worth taking (Oh)
It's a chance worth taking (It's a chance)
It's a chance worth taking

[Chorus]
You're standing out from everybody
Got my mind drunk, going crazy
Got me lookin' ahead at things
Seein' some better days, callin' it "our place"
Oh, I'm callin' it "our place"
Don't care if you break it, it's a chance worth taking

[Outro]
Oh, I'm gonna give it a chance
Oh, baby, don't, baby, don't, baby, don't break it
(It's a chance worth taking)
Oh, you're worth the chance

[Intro]
Laid back

[Verse 1]
Laid back, smoke up a chill in a zig zag
Working my way through a six pack
I guess that I'll be putting in overtime
Live it up a little longer
Keep it going all night
'Cause I know that we're never gonna get today back
So get laid back

[Chorus]
Who needs a plan when the sun is shining
Who gives damn when the beers on ice
Every time is the perfect timing
And it's time we go all out tonight
It ain't hard just taking it easy
Getting gone, if you need me
Sorry son, now if you wanna call me tomorrow
Then give me, give me a holler
But right now I'm busy getting laid back, laid back
Laid back, way back
Laid back, way back

[Verse 2]
Laid back, if you're looking for me I'll be right here
Soaking up the rays in a lawn chair, don't care
'Cause right now I ain't going nowhere

[Chorus]
Who needs a plan when the sun is shining
Who gives damn when the beers on ice
Every time is the perfect timing
And it's time we go all out tonight
It ain't hard just taking it easy
Getting gone, if you need me
Sorry son, now if you wanna call me tomorrow
Then give me, give me a holler
But right now I'm busy getting laid back, laid back

Who needs a plan when the sun is shining
Who gives damn when the beers on ice
Every time is the perfect timing
And it's time we go all out tonight
It ain't hard just taking it easy
Getting gone, if you need me
Sorry son, now if you wanna call me tomorrow
Then give me, give me a holler
But right now I'm busy getting laid back, laid back

[Verse 1]
Five minutes don't mean five minutes when she's slipping on that dress
Five minutes, don't take five minutes for us to break our plans
If you're gonna look like that, baby
Ain't nothing in the world can save
Five minutes, don't take five minutes for us to know we ain't gonna

[Chorus]
Make it to the party
Tell our friends we're sorry
We should kick it right here
To the rhythm of our heartbeats
Take it slow, do whatever we like, girl
Ain't gonna lie
If we keep making up then we ain't about to
Make it to the party

[Verse 2]
Five steps, won't take five steps for us to turn it back around
Five sips then another five sips and now we're losing count
If you're gonna look like that, baby
Ain't nothing in the world can save
Five seconds, don't wait five seconds to kiss me 'cause we ain't gonna

[Chorus]
Make it to the party
Tell our friends we're sorry
We should kick it right here
To the rhythm of our heartbeats
Take it slow, do whatever we like, girl
Ain't gonna lie
If we keep making up then we ain't about to
Make it to the party

[Bridge]
Let's rewind five minutes to that dress without you in it
We ain't gotta leave and meet nobody, just our bodies

[Chorus]
Ain't gonna make it to the party
Tell our friends we're sorry
We should kick it right here
To the rhythm of our heartbeats
Take it slow, do whatever we like, girl
Ain't gonna lie
If we keep making up then we ain't about to

Make it to the party
Tell our friends we're sorry
We should kick it right here
To the rhythm of our heartbeats
Take it slow, do whatever we like, girl
Ain't gonna lie
If we keep making up then we ain't about to
Make it to the party

[Verse 1]
You always had an eye for things that glittered
But I was far from bein' made of gold
I don't know how but I scraped up the money
I just never could quite tell you no
Just like when you were leavin' Amarillo
To take that new job in Tennessee
And I quit mine so we could be together
I can't forget the way you looked at me

[Chorus]
Just to see you smile
I'd do anything, that you wanted me to
When all is said and done
I'd never count the cost
It's worth all that's lost
Oh, just to see you smile
See you smile
Oh, see you smile
Oh, uhm

[Verse 2]
When you said time was all you really needed
I walked away and let you have your space
'Cause leavin' didn't hurt me near as badly
As the tears I saw rollin' down your face
And yesterday I knew just what you wanted
When you came walkin' up to me with him
So I told you that I was happy for you
And given the chance I'd lie again
Oh

[Chorus]
Just to see you smile
I'd do anything, that you wanted me to
When all is said and done
I'd never count the cost
It's worth all that's lost
Oh, just to see
Just to see you smile
I'd do anything, that you wanted me to
When all is said and done
I'd never count the cost
It's worth all that's lost
Oh, just to see you smile
See you smile
I'd do anything
(Just to see, just to see, just to see you smile)
Just to see you
(Just to see, just to see, just to see you smile)
Oh just to see, just to see, just to see you smile
Baby, just to see, just to see, just to see you smile

[Verse 1]
Just a small town Cinderella
Daddy wants you back home by midnight
Every time we're together
Yeah that's my dilemma
I need more time with you
I wanna watch the sun
Rise through the pines with you

[Pre-Chorus]
Night like this, wouldn't wanna' miss
Moonlight shining on a long slow kiss
You could be the one, I could get lucky with
If the boot fits

[Chorus]
Woah, diamonds in the sky lighting up those eyes
Like woah, you're the kind of fine that I can't deny
It gets me high, cross my heart hope to die
Pick a star make a wish
Yeah girl, you can be my all night
Dancing in the headlights
Fairytale good as it gets
If the boot fits

[Verse 2]
Yeah, baby, we can run away
My carriage is a 4x4 400-horse Chevrolet
You're like a princess
In a blue cotton dress
I can be your prince
If the boot fits

[Chorus]
Woah, diamonds in the sky lighting up those eyes
Like woah, you're the kind of fine that I can't deny
It gets me high, cross my heart hope to die
Pick a star make a wish
Yeah girl, you can be my all night
Dancing in the headlights
Fairytale good as it gets
If the boot fits

[Bridge]
Woah
Let me show a country boy treats a lady
Woah
Go ahead kick 'em off cos the boot fits lady

[Chorus]
Woah, diamonds in the sky lighting up those eyes
Like woah, you're the kind of fine that I can't deny
It gets me high, cross my heart hope to die
Pick a star make a wish
Yeah girl, you can be my all night
Dancing in the headlights
Fairytale good as it gets
If the boot fits
Woah, if the boot fits
Yeah, if the boot fits

[Verse 1]
Have yourself a merry little Christmas
Let your heart be light
From now on our troubles will be out of sight
Oh yeah

[Verse 2]
Have yourself a merry little Christmas
Make the Yuletide gay
From now on our troubles will be miles away
Oh, miles away, yeah

[Verse 3]
Here we are as in olden days
Happy golden days of yore
Faithful friends who are dear to us
Gather near to us, oh, once more
Yeah, yeah

[Verse 4]
Through the years we all will be together (Together)
If the fates allow, oh
Hang a shining star upon the highest bough
Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh, oh

[Chorus]
Have yourself a merry little Christmas
Have yourself a merry little Christmas
Ho, have yourself a merry little Christmas

[Outro]
Oh-oh-oh

[Intro]
Oh oh oh
Woah woah woah yeah
Oh oh oh yeah yeah

[Verse 1]
Take off those heels, lay on my bed
Whisper dirty secrets while I'm pulling on your hair
Poison in our veins but we don't even care
Candles dripping on your body, baby this ain't truth or dare

Everybody wonders where we run off to
My body on your body baby sticking like some glue
Naughty, let's get naughty girl, it's only one or two
The fever's fucking running, feel the heat between us too

[Chorus]
I'm gon ride, I'm gon ride, I'm gon ride
I'm gon ride on you baby, on you lady all night, all night
I'ma take care of your body, I'll be gentle, don't you scream
It's getting hotter, make it softer, feel your chest on top of me

I'm gon ride, I'm gon ride, I'm gon ride
I'm gon ride on you baby, on you lady all night, all night
I'm gon make you feel that loving, getting weak all in your knees
Kiss your body from the tip top all the way down to your feet

Yeah girl, we can go slow
Yeah, we can go slow

[Verse 2]
Lay on your back, like you right there
Don't have to say it twice, love, there's nothing here to fear
Taking it back, back to where it's clear
Rolling on and on, sounds of loving in the air

[Chorus]
I'm gon' ride, I'm gon' ride, I'm gon' ride
I'm gon' ride on you baby, on you lady all night, all night
I'ma take care of your body, I'll be gentle, don't you scream
It's getting hotter, make it softer, feel your chest on top of me

I'm gon' ride, I'm gon' ride, I'm gon' ride
I'm gon' ride on you baby, on you lady all night, all night
I'm gon' make you feel that loving, getting weak all in your knees
Kiss your body from the tip top all the way down to your feet

[Bridge]
The sun's coming up, you're on my side
I rub your thigh, you look in my eyes
And I just see the sky, I'm so high
And I ain't smoked yet, I'm just coming down from it

[Chorus]
I'm gon' ride, I'm gon' ride, I'm gon' ride
I'm gon' ride on you baby, on you lady all night, all night
I'ma take care of your body, I'll be gentle, don't you scream
It's getting hotter, make it softer, feel your chest on top of me

I'm gon' ride, I'm gon' ride, I'm gon' ride
I'm gon ride on you baby, on you lady all night, all night
I'm gon make you feel that loving, getting weak all in your knees
Kiss your body from the tip top all the way down to your feet

[Verse 1]
I don’t stay up late in the middle of the night
Drink from a bottle, half empty as me
I don’t cruise down Villa Place sometimes
Wonder why your car ain’t parked in the street
No way not me I'm way too tough
I ain’t tore up with what went down with us

[Chorus 1]
But if I'm being honest, baby, I'm still crazy about you
I fucked things up and now I’m man enough to finally face that truth
Since I'm being honest, baby, I got no clue what to do
So I stay drunk and high all the time to get me over you
If I'm being honest, if I'm being honest

[Verse 2]
My mom don't call to check on me
Cause she knows I'm good, yeah, doin’ just fine
And when I see my friends on Demonbreun street
I'm all calm and cool and having a hell of a time
I ain't masquerading your memory
No way no how, no that ain’t me

[Chorus 1]
But if I'm being honest, baby, I'm still crazy about you
I fucked things up and now i’m man enough to finally face that truth
Since I'm being honest, baby, i got no clue what to do
So i stay drink and high all the time to get me over you
If I'm being honest, if I'm being honest

[Bridge]
I don’t talk to god each night and pray, to him that you’re ok
And Come to think, I don’t think of you at all and wonder where you are today

[Chorus 2]
But if I'm being honest, baby, I'm still crazy about you
I fucked things up and now I’m man enough to finally face that truth
Since I'm being honest, baby, i got no clue what to do
So I string four cords and the truth, and rhymes and hope it reaches you
If I'm being honest, if I'm being honest

[Verse 1]
We've been to both Carolinas
Seen a big Montana sky
Driven up and down a coast a few times
London, Paris, paradise
But ain't got much memory of the scenes
Come to think, I miss them all
And damn, babe, it's all your fault

[Chorus]
No matter where we go
No matter what we do
If you're there, girl, I've got my eyes on you
Don't matter where we've been
No, there ain't no better view
Than you in my arms with my eyes on you
With my eyes on you (With my eyes on you, with my)
With my eyes on you (With my eyes on you, with my)

[Verse 2]
Speaking of the coast, remember Pfeiffer beach?
You and me, that sunset, cliffs by the sea
And the night rolled in
And you still talk about that moon that I can't recall
But God, I saw all I needed to
Might as well have stayed in the room

[Chorus]
No matter where we go
No matter what we do
If you're there, girl, I've got my eyes on you
Don't matter where we've been
No, there ain't no better view
Than you in my arms with my eyes on you
With my eyes on you, yeah (With my eyes on you, with my)
Yeah, with my eyes on you (With my eyes on you, with my)

[Bridge]
Don't you remember Times Square?
And people counting down everywhere
2000-whatever, no, I didn't care
'Cause baby you were there
And once again, couldn't help but stare

[Chorus]
No matter where we go
No matter what we do
If you're there, girl, I've got my eyes on you
Don't matter where we've been
No, there ain't no better view
Than you in my arms with my eyes on you
Halfway around the world
Or the local corner booth
Yeah, you guessed it, girl
You know I got my eyes on you
We could be on any street
Any party, any room
I'll be there all night with my eyes on you

[Outro]
Don't matter where we've been
No, there ain't no better view
Than you in my arms with my eyes on you

[Verse 1]
If it's Friday you know I'll be
Kickin' back with the boys down at Santa's pub
But don't hesitate, don't even think about waiting, nah just type it up
Yeah, I'm ready if you're ready or wonderin'
Stop thinking, hit send

[Chorus]
Doesn't matter if it's last call from a late night sidewalk
A little too buzzed, a little too drunk
You could have your hair down, all curled up on the couch
And the quiet ain't loud enough, nah
It could be A.M. or P.M.  
It could be middle of the week or the weekend, baby
It ain't too late or too far
Just call me 'cause I'm lonely
If you are, if you are
Yeah, I'm lonely if you are
If you are, if you are, yeah
Yeah, I'm lonely if you are

[Verse 2]
If it's Monday and it's over
You know the show your girls all come over for
And the red wine's getting lower
And your last friend's out the door
When there's no more roses to go around
Hit me up girl, you know I'm down

[Chorus]
It doesn't matter if it's last call from a late night sidewalk
A little too buzzed, a little too drunk
You could have your hair down, all curled up on the couch
And the quiet ain't loud enough, nah
It could be A.M. or P.M.  
It could be middle of the week or the weekend, baby
It ain't too late or too far
Just call me 'cause I'm lonely
If you are, if you are
Yeah, I'm lonely if you are
If you are, if you are
Yeah, I'm lonely if you are

[Bridge]
Oh, let me love the lonely right out of you
Oh, let me love the lonely right out of you
Oh yeah, if you're out there and lonely, girl, I'm lonely, too
So let me love the lonely right out of you

[Chorus]
It doesn't matter if it's last call from a late night sidewalk
Little too buzzed, a little too drunk
You could have your hair down, all curled up on the couch
And the quiet ain't loud enough, no
It could be A.M. or P.M.  
It could be middle of the week or the weekend, baby
It ain't too late or too far
Just call me 'cause I'm lonely
If you are, if you are, yeah
Yeah, I'm lonely if you are
If you are, if you are, yeah
Oh, I'm lonely if you are

[Verse 1]
There's a Tennessee two-lane sky
Shakes the Broadway bars at night
Makes you wanna get a little too close
To a Cali girl watchin' windshield satellites
It's a soundtrack to our lives
It's the only reason why
A kid from Carolina would drive to Nashville
To chase a dream without a dime

[Chorus 1]
It's why we drink too much on Friday nights
Raise our hand in the neon lights
Sweet Home Alabama and a Ring of Fire
I could sing along 'til the day I die
Why we break up, fall back in love
Why we roll around in the bed of a truck
Why we all stop when we hear that one
And she whispers, "Turn it up"

[Post-Chorus]
And for a second, we're bulletproof
We get lost in a song or two
The world don't move, and all I need is you
And three chords and the truth

[Verse 2]
I see you blinkin' through your blue eyes
How a song can turn back time
You can almost feel the sand on your feet
From the passenger seat
Singing anything but mine
And don't you know that we were raised on the radio?

[Chorus 2]
It's why we drink too much on Friday nights
Raise our hand in the neon lights
Copperhead Road and Mama tried
I could sing along 'til the day I die
Why we break up, fall back in love
Why we roll around in the bed of a truck
Why we all stop when we hear that one
And she whispers, "Turn it up"

[Post-Chorus]
And for a second, we're bulletproof
We get lost in a song or two
The world don't move, and all I need is you
And three chords and the truth

[Bridge]
It's Muscle Shoals to rock n' roll
It's a steel guitar that steals your soul
It's a country song that takes you home again

[Chorus 3]
It's why we drink too much on Friday nights
Raise our hand in church pew aisles
Amazing Grace, Sweet By and By
I could sing along 'til the day I die
Why we break up, fall back in love
Why we roll around in the bed of a truck
Why we all stop when we hear that one
And she whispers, "Turn it up"

[Post-Chorus]
And for a second we're bulletproof
Get lost in a song or two
The world don't move, and all I need is you
And three chords and the truth

[Intro: The Lord's Prayer]
Our Father, who art in heaven
Hallowed be thy Name
Thy kingdom come, thy will be done
On Earth as it is in heaven
Give us this day our daily bread
And forgive us our trespasses
As we forgive those who trespass against us
And lead us not into temptation
But deliver us from evil
For thine is the kingdom
And the power, and the glory
For ever and ever. Amen

[Verse 1]
Ain't no cage that can hold us
Ain't no hate that can fold us
Put on the chains and we'll break 'em
They want a battle we'll take 'em
Float like a butterfly, sting like a bee
They can't keep us on a leash

[Chorus]
The kings of our little towns
If there's a rebel around, you know it's gonna be one of us
We're right at home in the wild
Can't help it, that's our style
Born and bred to be dangerous
We might roll on a Saturday night
Get that look in our eyes and we're striking like lightning
Some may say we're too loud, some may say we're too proud
Well, there's lambs and there's lions

[Post-Chorus]
We are lions, we are lions
We are lions, we are lions

[Verse 2]
Our heads are down with our eyes up
Just like the sun, yeah, we'll rise up
Better think twice 'fore you size up
A second thought, yeah, you'll wise up

[Chorus]
The kings of our little towns
If there's a rebel around, you know it's gonna be one of us
We're right at home in the wild
Can't help it, that's our style
Born and bred to be dangerous
We might roll on a Saturday night
Get that look in our eyes and we're striking like lightning
Some may say we're too loud, some may say we're too proud
Well, there's lambs and there's lions

[Post-Chorus]
We are lions, we are lions
We are lions, we are lions
We are lions, we are lions
We are lions, we are lions

[Bridge]
Float like a butterfly, sting like a bee
They can't keep us on a leash
Which one are you gonna be?

[Chorus]
The kings of our little towns
If there's a rebel around, you know it's gonna be one of us
We're right at home in the wild
Can't help it, that's our style
Born and bred to be dangerous
We might roll on a Saturday night
Get that look in our eyes and we're striking like lightning
Some may say we're too loud, some may say we're too proud
Well, there's lambs and there's lions

[Outro]
We are lions, we are lions
We are lions, we are lions
We are lions, we are lions
We are lions, we are lions

[Verse 1]
Most of the time, I can't shut my damn mouth
And most of the time, my heart's too proud
I push 'em away, quick as they came
A living run away
And most of my life, I've lived on the dark side
And most of my nights, I smoke or drink too much
I've broken hearts once or twice
This time it feels like

[Chorus]
Living on the edge, falling fast and hard
And finally, your life, it ain't falling apart
Like a clock striking midnight you never saw coming
But it's right on time, and it stops you running
Leave it to me to play the fool
Who thinks numbing the pain makes you bulletproof
It takes hell and a lie to lead to the truth
But letting go of all of that means holding onto you

[Verse 2]
Ain't too many bridges that I ain't burned
Ain't too many reasons you should be here
It's either luck or God, and I don't care
Whoever's there heard my prayers

[Chorus]
Living on the edge, falling fast and hard
And finally, your life, it ain't falling apart
Like a clock striking midnight you never saw coming
But it's right on time, and it stops you running
Leave it to me to play the fool
Who thinks numbing the pain makes you bulletproof
It takes hell and a lie to lead to the truth
And letting go of all of that means holding onto you
I'm holding onto you

[Bridge]
It's almost like you were sent here to save me
And you saved me

[Chorus]
Living on the edge, falling fast and hard
And finally, your life, it ain't falling apart
Like a clock striking midnight you never saw coming
But it's right on time, and it stops you running
Leave it to me to play the fool
Who thinks numbing the pain makes you bulletproof
It takes hell and a lie to lead to the truth
But letting go of all of that means holding onto you
I'm holding onto you

[Outro]
It's almost like you were sent here to save me
And you saved me

[Verse 1]
Little red dress hanging on a hanger
You only wear it when you're feeling dangerous
Hope you slip it on slow in the mirror
And it makes you want to drink too much
When you can't unzip yourself, so you ask for a little help
Through a red wine, kiss-me smile
I hope it's on tonight

[Chorus]
I hope 1:15 rolls around
And you need me, like I need you right now
I don't care, what we said
If I'm on your mind, it ain't over, not yet
Yeah, you and me are kinda like that blinking caution light
We've been on again and off again so many times
I hope it's on tonight
I hope it's on tonight

[Verse 2]
Hope you're in the back of a yellow cab
And a song comes on from way back when
When it flips that switch inside you
Makes you wanna pull me in
And when you sing right up the stairs
While you're taking down your hair
And it sets the room on fire
I hope it's on tonight

[Chorus]
And I hope 1:15 rolls around
And you need me, like I need you right now
I don't care, what we said
If I'm on your mind, it ain't over, not yet
Yeah, you and me are kinda like that blinking caution light
We've been on again and off again so many times
I hope it's on tonight
I hope it's on tonight

[Bridge]
I hope your head is on your phone
And you don't wanna be alone
I really don't wanna be alone

[Chorus]
If 1:15 rolls around
And you need me, like I need you right now
Yeah, I don't care, what we said
If I'm on your mind, it ain't over, not yet
Yeah, you and me are kinda like that blinking caution light
We've been on again and off again so many times
I hope it's on tonight
I hope it's on tonight

[Verse 1]
You know, I really thought I was moving on
'Til that George Strait song came on
Goin' on about his ex from Texas
Guess with me, that's a memory, yeah, I don't mess
Well, 'til the king brought you up in the speakers of this truck
Now you're stuck here in my mind

[Chorus]
Everybody got that one love, that one kiss
Keep thinking 'bout what you're gonna miss (You're gonna miss)
As soon as they go
Everybody got that one drink, that one song
Drowns you out, takes you along (Takes you along)
Down memory road
I drive my Chevy, crank the music
Roll to her place, no, don't do it
Okay, go in, here we go again
Just how it goes when that's what you know
Whoa, whoa, whoa, what you know

[Verse 2]
What you know, I hit Tin Roof
And sure I know it's just plain bad news
J Griff serves my old go-to
And like clockwork, incoming call from you, yeah

[Chorus]
Everybody got that one love, that one kiss
Keep thinking 'bout what you're gonna miss (You're gonna miss)
As soon as they go
Everybody got that one drink, that one song
Drowns you out, takes you along (Takes you along)
Down memory road
I drive my Chevy, crank the music
Roll to her place, no, don't do it
Okay, go in, here we go again
Just how it goes when that's what you know
Whoa, whoa, whoa, what you know
Whoa, whoa, whoa, what you know

[Bridge]
My truck, my keys, third time this week
My low beams down that same old street
One love, one kiss, one drink, one song
I think of you, one sip, I'm gone

[Chorus]
Yeah, everybody got that one love, that one kiss
Keep thinking 'bout what you're gonna miss
As soon as they go
Everybody got that one drink, that one song
Drowns you out, takes you along
Down memory road
I drive my Chevy, crank the music
Roll to her place, no, don't do it
Okay, go in, here we go again
Just how it goes when that's what you know
Whoa, whoa, whoa, what you know
Whoa, whoa, whoa, what you know

[Bridge]
My truck, my keys, third time this week
My low beams down that same old street
One love, one kiss, one drink, one song
I think of you, one sip, I'm gone, yeah

[Outro]
You know, I really thought I was moving on
'Til that George Strait song came on

[Verse 1]
If you wanna climb a ladder on a water tower
Then we'll kick it with the stars for a couple hours
If you wanna then we're gonna get way up high
If you wanna dip your toes where the water stops
Then we'll let our feet hang off a fishin' dock
If you wanna then we're gonna have to give it a try, that's right

[Pre-Chorus]
If you wanna go way out where there ain't nobody around
And let your long hair get to fallin' down
And let your red lips leave their mark all over mine

If you wanna then we're gonna girl
I hope you're gonna wanna tonight
If you wanna then we're gonna girl
I hope you're gonna wanna all night

[Verse 2]
If you wanna catch a buzz and ride it til the mornin'
Let's get two plastic cups and baby I'll get to pourin'
I don't really matter if it's whiskey or wine, it's fine

[Pre-Chorus]
If you wanna go way out where there ain't nobody around
And let your long hair get to fallin' down
And let your red lips leave their mark all over mine

Fill up the night air with the radio
And put your hands wherever they wanna go
Yeah, we're right there
Girl just close your eyes

[Chorus]
If you wanna then we're gonna girl
I hope you're gonna wanna tonight
If you wanna then we're gonna girl
I hope you're gonna wanna all night

Gonna wanna get a little closer
Gonna wanna slide it on over
Gonna wanna

[Pre-Chorus]
Gonna wanna go way out where there ain't nobody around
And let your long hair get to fallin' down
And let your red lips leave their mark all over mine

Come on
Fill up the night air with the radio
And put your hands wherever they wanna go
Yeah, we're right there
Girl just close your eyes

[Chorus]
If you wanna then we're gonna girl
I hope you're gonna wanna tonight
If you wanna then we're gonna girl
I hope you're gonna wanna all night

Gonna wanna get a little closer
Gonna wanna slide it on over
Gonna wanna

Ya gonna wanna tonight

[Verse 1]
Wasn't hello, it wasn't goodbye
It's everything in between that hangs in my mind
Got your dust heart on my dashboard
Your flip flops on my floorboard
Your scratch-offs that you asked for
Your tire marks on my carport

[Chorus]
I, I never woulda wrote you a love song
Woulda told you to keep all of your clothes on
Woulda never turned you on like late night TV
Let you talk to me dirty, oh, silly me
I woulda never been a stand-up guy
Shoulda stood you up the very first night
And girl, I woulda never let you go
Had I known that you'd be so unforgettable

[Post-Chorus]
Unforgettable, unforgettable, yeah

[Verse 2]
Benny Ludwig's, Alma Jean's, anything Tennessee
Tin roof, cheap whiskey, ignites your memory
Like every Jeep I see on the road
I slow on down and secretly hope
I see your face through the window, whoa

[Chorus]
I, I never woulda wrote you a love song
Woulda told you to keep all of your clothes on
Woulda never turned you on like late night TV
Let you talk to me dirty, oh, silly me
I woulda never been a stand-up guy
Shoulda stood you up the very first night
And girl, I woulda never let you go
Had I known that you'd be so unforgettable

[Post-Chorus]
Unforgettable, unforgettable
Oh baby, you're unforgettable

[Bridge]
Irreplaceable, undeniable
Beautiful, it's unforgettable (Unforgettable)
Irreplaceable, undeniable
That beautiful soul, so unforgettable

[Chorus]
I (I), I never woulda wrote you a love song
Woulda told you to keep all of your clothes on (Keep 'em on, keep 'em on)
Woulda never turned you on like late night TV
Let you talk to me dirty, oh, silly me
I (I) would've never been a stand-up guy (Oh, I never woulda)
Should've stood you up the very first night (First night, first night)
And girl, I would've never let you go
Had I known that you'd be so unforgettable

[Post-Chorus]
Unforgettable
Unforgettable, so unforgettable
So unforgettable, yeah

[Verse 1]
Maybe your granddad kept his dog tags hanging on the rearview
And maybe your mama drove you around in a Chevy Nova bright blue
Might've got your 16 first date, yes at a slider in the drive thru
Down on Main Street, she was so cute, ended up just friends
If it sounds like it could've been you, or it's somewhere you might've been
Can I get an amen?

[Chorus]
For a Roman candle sky
A July praying for rain
Yeah, sparks out the window, cigarette
With her silhouette caught in the flames
The keys to a fix-it-up dream
The love in a first crush heart
And to not knowing the secrets of life
But damn sure knowing where it starts
Amen, amen, amen

[Verse 2]
And maybe you shot some bullet holes through the tail of a windmill
Stuck a cross in some flowers by the road on the edge of a wheat field
And maybe that scar on your hands from a midnight parking lot disagreement with one of your buddies
So you squared off, then you made up
With a tailgate cold beer apology
Just some memories that'll always be

[Chorus]
In a Roman candle sky
A July praying for rain
Yeah, sparks out the window, cigarette
With her silhouette caught in the flames
The keys to a fix-it-up dream
The love in a first crush heart
And to not knowing the secrets of life
But damn sure knowing where it starts
Amen, amen, amen

[Bridge]
Amen
Yeah, amen
Ooh, amen

[Chorus]
For a Roman candle sky
A July praying for rain
Yeah, the sparks out the window, cigarette
With her silhouette caught in the flames
The keys to a fix-it-up dream
The love in a first crush heart
And to not knowing the secrets of life
But damn sure knowing where it starts
Amen, amen, amen
Ooh, amen

It was laying pennies on the rail's and sneaking off to chew Red Man
It was a Friday night win and followed by a Saturday bruise
It was a first Blue Ribbon my dad and I drank, baptized on Glenville lake
A tear in our eyes the night we lost all we had to lose

That tobacco town where I grew up
The tailgate down on a jacked up truck
A ring we earned cause we owned that state
A tombstone with my daddy's name
Now the six string dream on a crazy course
Has got my compass losing North
And I need someone to remind me who I am
Oh, Carolina can

It was faded blue denim on Franklin Street
A "He's Not" buzz, a house band beat
It was a summer heat dragging me to a fifth year fall
It was classes skipped cause the room couldn't teach
What we learned three days on Wrightsville beach
With my high school love, short hair
And that sweet hometown southern drawl

That tobacco town where I grew up
The tailgate down on a jacked up truck
A ring we earned cause we owned that state
A tombstone with my daddy's name
Now the six string dream on a crazy course
Has got my compass losing North
And I need someone to remind me who I am
Yeah, Carolina can
Carolina can

Now two time zones, ten states away
Another night, another show to play
Oh hey Mr. Taylor, she ain't only on your mind

That tobacco town where I grew up
The tailgate down on a jacked up truck
A ring we earned cause we owned that state
A tombstone with my daddy's name
The six string dream on a crazy course
Has got my compass losing North
And I need someone to remind me who I am
Yeah, when I need someone to remind me who I am
Yeah, Carolina can
Carolina can
Carolina can

[Verse 1]
Lately I've been tradin' a good sermon and some prayin'
For a stranger in my bed and a night that needs explainin'
Opened more bottles than I ever have my Bible
This dirt road communion sure won't lead me to revival
Between the black label and the letters in red
I felt what livin' is, and what it's like to live dead

(Chorus)
I’ve taken a ride in the devil's Cadillac
I’ve been so high I thought I wasn't comin' back
And just when I think I'm too far gone
Ringin' in my head's the 23rd Psalm
I've seen the light, I've seen the darkness
Only god knows where my heart is
I've got my strength and Lord knows I've got my weakness
Oh I'm lost somewhere between Jack Daniels and Jesus

[Verse 2]
It's my fault that I ain't called my mama in a month of Sundays
She'll smell the whiskey through that phone, I can't stand to hear or heart break
And next week I'll see my brother Casey for the first time
Since it all went down and I blacked his eye the night after our daddy died

(Chorus)
I’ve taken a ride in the devil's Cadillac
I’ve been so high I thought I wasn't comin' back
And just when I think I'm too far gone
Ringin' in my head's the 23rd Psalm
I've seen the light, I've seen the darkness
Only god knows where my heart is
I've got my strength and Lord knows I've got my weakness
Oh I'm lost somewhere between Jack Daniels and Jesus

[bridge]
I ain't afraid to admit I've hit rock bottom
You wanna see a lifetime full of sins?
Just look at me, I've got 'em

(Chorus)
I’ve taken a ride in the devil's Cadillac
I’ve been so high I thought I wasn't comin' back
And just when I think I'm too far gone
Ringin' in my head's the 23rd Psalm
I've seen the light, I've seen the darkness
Only god knows where my heart is
I've got my strength and Lord knows I've got my weakness
Oh I'm lost somewhere between Jack Daniels and Jesus

[Verse 1]
Damn, pretty girl you went and done it again
You've gone and turned your sexy all the way up to 10
I've never seen a side ride seat looking so hot
Baby, you rock, hit the spot like a fireball shot
You've got me all high, head spinning around and around
I'm down if you're down to burn down this town

[Chorus]
Ready, set, let's roll
Ready, set, let's ride
Get your little fine ass on the step, shimmy up inside
Just slide, girl, by my side, girl
Yeah, we can run this town, I can rock your world
We can roll 'em down, fog 'em up, cruise around, get stuck
Pedal to the metal 'til the sun comes up
I made a deal with the man on the moon
He's gonna put in some overtime, we've got all night
Ready, set, let's roll
Ready, set, let's ride
Ready, set, let's roll

[Verse 2]
Where the good years and good times meet
Girl, we can rev it up right 'til we overheat
Just forget about the time, get your lips on mine
Gotta kiss you, get to know your smile
On your mark, get set

[Chorus]
Ready, set, let's roll
Ready, set, let's ride
Get your little fine ass on the step, shimmy up inside
Just slide, girl, by my side, girl
Yeah, we can run this town, I can rock your world
We can roll 'em down, fog 'em up, cruise around, get stuck
Pedal to the metal 'til the sun comes up
I made a deal with the man on the moon
He's gonna put in some overtime, we've got all night
Ready, set, let's roll
Ready, set, let's ride
Ready, set, let's roll
Ready, set, let's ride

[Bridge]
You got my heart bump-bumping
When I'm pulling up into your drive
Let's hit it 90 to nothin'
Couple kids running into the night

[Chorus]
Ready, set, let's roll
Ready, set, let's ride
Get your little fine ass on the step, shimmy up inside
Just slide, girl, by my side, girl
Yeah, we can run this town, I can rock your world
We can roll 'em down, fog 'em up, cruise around, get stuck
Pedal to the metal 'til the sun comes up
I made a deal with the man on the moon
He's gonna put in some overtime, we've got all night
Ready, set, let's roll
Ready, set, let's ride
Ready, set, let's roll
Ready, set, let's ride
Get your little fine ass on the step, shimmy up on inside

[Outro]
Yeah we can run this town
You know I'll rock your world, c'mon
Let's roll, let's ride, let's run this town tonight
Read, set, let's roll

[Verse 1]
You know about my wilder days
All about the hell I raised
Like a grenade with a pin gone
Without you, babe, the whole thing's blown, yeah
I knew how to hold a crowd
Shooting liquor and the lights out
You knew the ride I was on
But you love me like you don’t

[Chorus]
You don't worry 'bout the things I’ve done
Where I've been or who I was
You only see the guy I'm tryna be
You know you coulda had anyone else
Made it easier on yourself
You know my crazy river soul
But you love me like you don't

[Verse 2]
I never thought I'd settle down
'Til you turned this heart around
Saved me like a Sunday morning song
You take me high, you take me home, yeah
God, you musta had some doubts
Yeah, I'm sure you think about
Who the hell I was before you came along
But you love me like you don't

[Chorus]
You don’t worry ’bout the things I've done
Where I’ve been or who I was
You only see the guy I'm tryna be
You know you coulda had anyone else
Made it easier on yourself
You know my crazy river soul
But you love me like you don't
Whoa, whoa, whoa

[Outro]
You know you coulda had anyone else
Made it easier on yourself
You know my crazy river soul
But you love me like you don't
Whoa, whoa, whoa
You know you coulda had anyone else
Made it easier on yourself
You know my crazy river soul
But you love me like you don’t
Whoa, whoa, whoa

I've been sitting here watching
I can't stop staring at you across the room
I can see you in my truck, I can see you downtown
I can see you waking up, I can see you laying down
See you in the lights dancing to the band
Or here in my hand

So what's your name? Where you from?
What's your drink when you get drunk?
What's your sign? What's your song?
I want to know what turns you on
What you wear when you get home?
Who do you call when you're alone?
Every guy in here is thinking the same thing
Girl, what's your name?

Yeah we've never spoken
And you've never met me before, I'm pretty sure
I can see you in the dark, I can see you in a dress
I can see your pretty head sleeping on my chest
I can't help it, it's out of nowhere
Oh but girl, I gotta go there

What's your name? Where you from?
What's your drink when you get drunk?
What's your sign? What's your song?
I want to know what turns you on
What you wear when you get home?
Who do you call when you're alone?
Every guy in here is thinking the same thing
Girl, what's your name?
Girl, what's your name?

I can see you in my truck, I can see you downtown
I can see you looking up, I can see you laying down

So what's your name? Where you from?
What's your drink when you get drunk?
What's your sign? What's your song?
Tell me girl, what turns you on?
What gets you down? What gets you high?
What keeps you up in the dead of night?
What I don't know about you is killing me
Girl, what's your name?

[Verse 1]
Flat on my back, underneath my truck
Couple buddies rollin' in to help me fix 'er up
I ask for a wrench, and they gave me a Solo
So we've been workin' long enough today
So I'm thinking it's Coors Banquet or Miller Lite
But to my head shakin', a cold sip surprise

[Chorus]
Jack Daniels showed up
See, I was supposed to just get a little bit of a buzz
From the fuzz of a cold beer, then out of nowhere
He just had to interrupt, and jump into my cup
Yeah, he wasn't invited, but that's alright
Man, we all decided he could hang all night
Wasn't supposed to be a party, just chill enough
Just a couple of buds, but
Jack Daniels showed up

[Verse 2]
Friday night country song, low C
I brought the cooler, she brought the heat
And then she turned me on & up a couple hundred degrees
When she turned down my beer and reached under the seat

[Chorus]
Jack Daniels showed up
See, I was supposed to just get a little bit of a buzz
From the fuzz of a cold beer, then out of nowhere
He just had to interrupt, and jump into my cup
Yeah, he wasn't invited, but that's alright
Man, we both decided he could hang all night
Wasn't supposed to be a party, just chill enough
A little back seat love, but
Jack Daniels showed up

[Bridge]
So Gorley, Chris and I were just a-writing this song
But you know four names should get credit
'Cause us three picked guitars all night long
But it didn't sound like a hit record 'til

[Chorus]
Jack Daniels showed up
See, I was supposed to just get a little bit of a buzz
From the fuzz of a cold beer, then out of nowhere
He just had to interrupt, and jump into my cup
Yeah, he wasn't invited, but that's alright
Man, we all decided he could hang all night
It wasn't supposed to be a party, just chill enough
'Til he busted through the door, like what?
Jack Daniels showed up
Jack Daniels showed up

[Verse 1]
What if I rolled the dial to the right
And let that minor chord steer this night
What if I slid a match and lit the wick
What if I shut you up
With my lips on your lips

Let the gravel in my voice
Drown out all the noise

[Chorus]
With a whisper tonight
These thoughts that
No one else should hear
Cut through my lips
Dance in your ear
Till light comes burning
Through that window pane
Your hair's painting that pillow case
Answer me baby
With nothing but your body
Your hands got a crazy way
Of talking naughty
Let the other side of these walls
The ups and downs of these halls (oh)
Hear what can start with a whisper

[Verse 2]
And what if that
Kitchen table gets wrecked
Yeah, plates crashing down
With my breath on your neck
What if that $75.94
You spent at the store
Takes the rest of the night off
As it slides to the floor

[Chorus]
With a whisper tonight
These thoughts that
No one else should hear
Cut through my lips
Dance in your ear
Till light comes burning
Through that window pane
Your hair's painting that pillow case
Answer me baby
With nothing but your body
Your hands got a crazy way
Of talking naughty
Let the other side of these walls
The ups and downs of these halls (oh)
Hear what can start with a whisper
Oh, with a whisper, yeah

Let the gravel in my voice
Drown out all the noise

[Chorus]
With a whisper tonight
These thoughts that
No one else should hear
Cut through my lips
Dance in your ear
Till light comes burning
Through that window pane
Your hair's painting that pillow case
Answer me baby
With nothing but your body
Your hands got a crazy way
Of talking naughty
Let the other side of these walls
The ups and downs of these halls (oh)
Hear what can start with a whisper
With a whisper, yeah
With a whisper

Yeah, hear what can start with a whisper

[Verse 1]
Was I just dreaming?
Were my eyes playing tricks on me?
Was I really seeing?
Such a belle at 25 Wexford Street
I ain't gonna lie, don't recall her name
But the Dublin lights saw everything
Now the legend lives all across that town
An American boy and an Irish gal

[Chorus]
That night, all night
We were dancing straight to sheets
Yeah, she was mine, all mine
Lost in the beauty of the beat
Let the sound of the pound bump in our chests
'Til the sunrise laid our lust to rest
She left and the only thing left of her
Is one night, and my, what a beautiful blur

[Verse 2]
Black hair, blue eyes, tattoos dark as night
And her necklace just said "dreamer" on a key
I ain't gonna lie, I recall her curse
And the jet black ink of a Bible verse
The things we did, never thought I would
But the 23rd psalm never looked so good

[Chorus]
That night, all night
We were dancing straight to sheets
Yeah, she was mine, all mine
Lost in the beauty of the beat
Let the sound of the pound bump in our chests
'Til the sunrise laid our lust to rest
She left and the only thing left of her
Is one night, and my, what a beautiful blur

[Guitar solo]

[Bridge]
Kinda fitting her necklace said "dreams"
That's the only time I see her

[Chorus]
Yeah, that night, all night
We were dancing straight to sheets
Yeah, she was mine, all mine
Lost in the beauty of the beat
Yeah, that night, all night
We were dancing straight to sheets
Yeah, she was mine, all mine
Lost in the beauty of the beat
Let the sound of the pound bump in our chests
'Til the sunrise laid our lust to rest
She left and the only thing left of her
Is one night, and my, what a beautiful blur
What a beautiful blur
What a beautiful blur

[Verse 1]
You got a Daytona gold tan, skin like the soft sand
Girl you're as cool as the blue on a cold can
Little bit of wild child, coming through that tipsy smile
With you wearing whatever the hell you want kind of style
The kind of naughty habit I could get used to, heh

[Chorus]
You set a fire up and down my skin as your fingertips go scraping
I'm as gone as I've ever been and it ain't weed or whiskey, baby
You put your hands on me, I'll put my hands on you
We'll get out of hand, girl, I'll give you whatever hand you want me to
I can't quit, can't kick this kind of craving
Girl you drive me to fifty shades of crazy

[Verse 2]
Hint of a lime twist, cinnamon lipstick
You're dropping hips, give a glimpse of your secret
Starts with just a kiss, then we’ll take innocence
Put it in the rear view and haul ass straight for sin

[Chorus]
You set a fire up and down my skin as your fingertips go scraping
I'm as gone as I've ever been and it ain't weed or whiskey, baby
You put your hands on me, I'll put my hands on you
We'll get out of hand, girl, I'll give you whatever hand you want me to
I can't quit, can't kick this kind of craving
Girl you drive me to fifty shades of crazy

[Bridge]
Girl I lose my mind
A little more every time
I've been racing, cross the line
Let me make your body unwind

[Chorus]
You set a fire up and down my skin as your fingertips go scraping
I'm as gone as I've ever been and it ain't weed or whiskey, baby
You put your hands on me, I'll put my hands on you
We'll get out of hand, girl, I'll give you whatever hand you want me to
I can't quit, can't kick this kind of craving
Girl you drive me to fifty shades of crazy
Fifty shades of crazy

[Outro]
You put your hands on me, I'll put my hands on you
We'll get out of hand, girl, I'll give you whatever hand you want me to
I can't quit, can't kick this kind of craving
Girl you drive me to fifty shades of crazy

[Intro]
Everybody we know does

[Verse 1]
Not everybody throws their empties in a truck bed
Pours sweat off forty hours for a pay check
Take it to the bank at five save a nickel, spend a dime
On living it up
Not everybody knows an outskirts sky glow
Yell turn it up sing every word of friends in low
Not everybody likes a Friday night
Covered in dust but everybody we know does

[Chorus]
That's what we do, that's what we love
That's how we were raised, how we grew up
Runs deep in our veins, way down in our blood
Everybody we know does
Put your boots to the ground 'til the sun goes down
Kill a couple long necks 'til we come back around
Nah, it ain't no big deal around here for us
Everybody we know does

[Verse 2]
Not everybody understands how we make it
Hold it together when we feel like breakin'
Not everybody knows what we're made of but
Everybody we know does

[Chorus]
That's what we do, that's what we love
That's how we were raised, how we grew up
Runs deep in our veins, way down in our blood
Everybody we know does
Put your boots to the ground 'til the sun goes down
Kill a couple long necks 'til we come back around
Nah, it ain't no big deal around here for us
Everybody we know does
Everybody we know does

[Bridge]
Not everybody knows an outskirts sky glow
Yell turn it up sing every word of friends in low
But everybody we know does

[Chorus]
That's what we do, that's what we love
That's how we were raised, how we grew up
Runs deep in our veins, way down in our blood
Everybody we know does
Put your boots to the ground 'til the sun goes down
Kill a couple long necks 'til we come back around
Nah, it ain't no big deal around here for us
Everybody we know does

[Outro]
Put your boots to the ground 'til the sun goes down
Kill a couple long necks 'til we come back around
Nah, it ain't no big deal around here for us
Everybody we know does

It’s the roses just because, yeah just because it’s Tuesday
And it’s lettin’ ‘er drive my truck after what she did to the tailgate
And it’s holding back her hair after one too many drinks

[Chorus]
Yea, it’s the little things
Oh, it’s the little things
No, she doesn’t need a 4 karat diamond ring or a big house to come home to
No, she doesn’t need a Hollywood movie scene or a sunset everyday in Malibu
No, all she needs are the little things

And it’s watching that damn Bachelor every Monday night
And loving her like I don’t have her and shutting up even when I’m right
And it’s playing her this new song I just wrote on this ole' six string

Yea, it’s the little things
Oh, it’s the little things
No, she doesn’t need a 4 karat diamond ring or a big house to come home to
No, she doesn’t need a Hollywood movie scene or a sunset everyday in Malibu
No, all she needs are the little things

[Verse 1]
She's a "pick me up at 6"
Make ya wait ’til 8
Country girl, sticker on a Chevrolet
She's clothes on an old pine down by the river bank
Buzz from a cheap wine
First love on a tailgate

[Pre-Chorus]
A summer night in July
Bottle rocket flying high
Fire poppin'
Body rockin', droppin’ under the moonlight

[Chorus]
My baby’s a hands in the air
Don't have a care when her song's on the radio
A little crazy with a blue jean tear
Gets a Ray Ban stare just about everywhere we go
She likes to get down
Sippin' on coke and crown
Jesus and gypsy soul
Yeah, that's how she rocks
And that's how she rolls

[Verse 2]
She's a backwards hat
"Hey boys, what's up?"
Strawberry lip sip from a Dixie cup
A quicksilver tan line
Rocking shotgun in my truck
A charm with a peace sign 'round her neck for a little luck

[Chorus]
My baby’s a hands in the air
Don't have a care when her song's on the radio
A little crazy with a blue jean tear
Gets a Ray Ban stare just about everywhere we go
She likes to get down
Sippin' on coke and crown
Jesus and gypsy soul
Yeah, that's how she rocks
And that's how she rolls

[Bridge]
Yeah, that's how she rolls
My baby’s a hands in the air
She don't have a care when her song's on the radio
A little crazy with a blue jean tear
Gets a Ray Ban stare just about everywhere we go

[Chorus]
My baby’s a hands in the air
Don't have a care when her song's on the radio
A little crazy with a blue jean tear
Gets a Ray Ban stare just about everywhere we go
She likes to get down
Sippin' on coke and crown
Jesus and gypsy soul
Yeah, that's how she rocks
And that's how she rolls

[Outro]
Yeah, that's how she rolls
Yeah, that's how she rolls

[Verse 1]
That old foreign road, that’s where we go
We, we ain't got no VIP
No rope tied between these trees, pull on up and make yourself at home

There's a Bible on the dash, a little too good at collecting dust
There's a shotgun on the rack, and that rearview's got a picture of us
That radio dial stays on 95.3 cause it's the only one around here that plays country

If ya want to get to get to know me it ain't that hard
It's sitting on some Goodyears there in the yard
Got some dents, got some dings, been my best friend since I was 16
Baptized in dirty water, handed down to me from my father
If ya wanna know, wanna know what I'm made of just look at my truck

That headlights still busted out from the night they tried to take my keys
And that tailgate's all rusted now, but you wouldn't believe the good times it's seen
And when the girls would come and it can haul some ass
You'd never seen an '85 hit a hundred that fast

If ya want to get to get to know me it ain't that hard
It's sitting on some Goodyears there in the yard
Got some dents, got some dings, been my best friend since I was 16
Baptized in dirty water, handed down to me from my father
If ya wanna know, wanna know what I'm made of just look at my truck

Yeah, plenty of stop sign, birds on the power line, shot in the daylight on county road 39
Plenty of full moons, plenty of me and you, plenty of memories in the rearview

If ya want to get to get to know me it ain't that hard
It's sitting on some Goodyears there in the yard
Got some dents, got some dings, been my best friend since I was 16
Baptized in dirty water, handed down to me from my father
If ya wanna know, wanna know what I'm made of
I said if ya wanna know, wanna know what I'm made of just look at my truck

Aw yeah just look at my truck
Go on and look at my truck

[Verse 1]
Five card, with the fellas on a Friday night
One hit, a little trip to get us feeling right
Boom boom coming hot out the tubes
Talking big game like us boys do

Then those hazel eyes, fire the light
On the eye five now I'm throwing deuces
I'm gone, fellas, catch you on the flip side
They give me hell like, what the hell?
Man you always bounce with poor excuses
But I'm out the door, hauling ass to you and ninety-five

[Chorus]
I ride, swinging dust in my truck, can't get to you quick enough
Tonight, it's you and me, baby girl, getting lost in our own world
The way you looking fine, the way your skin's on mine
We're on fire, damn girl, you bout to blow my mind
Tangling in these sheets, you lock them eyes on me
Beats a beer with the boys any night of the week

[Verse 2]
Girl why you laughing? I've told this joke a thousand times
But don't you dare stop, you know I love to hear your smile
Laying you down feels so right, nothing better than you by my side
Yeah then you give me hell for a smell, a high life on my breath
I say, come on, now you knew I'd be right here
I was up a hundred bucks when you hit me with that text
Folded on a full house and threw my truck in fifth gear

[Chorus]
I ride, swinging dust in my truck, can't get to you quick enough
Tonight, it's you and me, baby girl, getting lost in our own world
The way you looking fine, the way your skin's on mine
We're on fire, damn girl, you bout to blow my mind
Tangling in these sheets, you lock them eyes on me
Beats a beer with the boys any night of the week
Yeah hanging with them is a damn good time
But it's got nothing on what, what I'm seeing tonight
So I ride, swinging dust in my truck, can't get to you quick enough
Tonight, it's you and me, baby girl, getting lost in our own world
The way you looking fine, the way your skin's on mine
We're on fire, damn girl, you bout to blow my mind
Tangling in these sheets, you lock them eyes on me
Beats a beer with the boys any night of the week

"Yo Chase, what's up man? What you doing?"
"C'mon man, what the hell you think I'm doing?
Heh, I'm going out"

We got the crew and the crew cap rocking that rebel flag
All hats back like a redneck rat pack
Boys looking cool blowing smoke from the mary jane
Girls hair down, frayed out, brought that A game
Kick back and watch how we do
Like Project X, we're next on the YouTube, yeah

We going out, we going out
We got our eyes blurred right and the weird up loud
We going out, yeah we ignite the night in the sunburn town
Locked and loaded, rocked and rolling
Driving our shit just like we stole it
All night, good time, damn right
We going out, out, out, out
We going out, out, out, out

It's going down like a whiskey waterfall
So raise your cup up up for a rockstar roll call
The yeti's low quick damn right we're killing it
Cold throwing in looks like we'll be chilling it

We going out, we going out
We got our eyes blurred right and the weird up loud
We going out, yeah we ignite the night in the sunburn town
Locked and loaded, rocked and rolling
Driving our shit just like we stole it
All night, good time, damn right
We going out, out, out, out
We going out, out, out, out

Now they say lightning don't strike twice
But we here tonight, ain't we?

We going out, we going out
We got our eyes blurred right and the weird up loud
We going out, yeah we ignite the night in the sunburn town
Locked and loaded, rocked and rolling
Driving our shit just like we stole it
All night, good time, damn right
We going out, out, out, out
We going out, out, out, out
We going out, out, out, out, we going out
We going out, out, out, out, we going out
We going out, out, out, out, we going out

What do you say dude? You down?
Hell yeah, count me in for that man

Carolina sun rays sinking on a south side pier
Cotton candy, salty kisses, and a couple stolen beers
Your tan lines were the map for my hands to find their way
And that empty lifeguard shack, we watched our innocence fade

Caught in that beach blonde salt sand tide
Ferris wheel make our ride
Soak in the summer wind, copper tone visiting
Tracing the tattoos on your skin
One, two, three months fly
Like a blink in your blue eyes
Where young love rolls in fast as it rolls out
In beach town

Sneaking in and getting kicked out at the bayside pool
And watching your tee shirt drip dry
Middle of the night, that was so damn cool
And sandals in your hands
Swaying to the beat of an off beat cover band
Spilling your drink, making me sink
Deeper and deeper with every half drunk wink

In that beach box salt sand tide
Ferris wheel make our ride
Soak in the summer wind, copper tone visiting
Tracing the tattoos on your skin
One, two, three months fly
Like a blink in your blue eyes
Where young love rolls in fast as it rolls out

Florida State came calling
Your goodbye tears came falling
I said I don't want to go if you don't want to go
So we just kept on stalling
We kept on stalling

Caught in that beach blonde salt sand tide
Ferris wheel make our ride
Soak in the summer wind, copper tone visiting
Tracing the tattoos on your skin
One, two, three months fly
Like a blink in your blue eyes
Young love rolls in fast as it rolls out
Young love rolls in fast as it rolls out
In beach town
In beach town

[Verse 1 - Chase Rice]
Silhouette, moonlight halo
Wayfarer's looking all Hollywood

Looking like it's doing you good

[Chorus - Chase Rice]

Mmm girl, mmm girl, yeah you're working it flirting
Got your tummy out on the prowl
Mmm girl, mmm girl, what you doing for the rest of the night?

[Verse 2 -Chase Rice]
Victoria's Secret, they're peeking out
It'd be a damn good secret to keep
It's something that you ain't gotta worry bout
I'll keep it just between you and me
And tick tock, time to wind it down
Before we take it on back to town
We'll top it off, last call, just wanna be
You and me, you and me, yeah

[Chorus - Chase Rice]
Yeah you got me all mmm girl, mmm girl
Yeah I'm buzzing like a shot of Jack, fire on a cool night

Dang gum
Look at her

Alright

Met a girl in Myrtle beach
On the board walk makin' sweet eyes at me
She could be a Georgia peach, a Bama babe or a Carolina queen

I thought "yeah look at that smile"
Daisy dukes that drive me wild
Backwards camo Braves hat on
Cover bands rockin' and she's singin' along

Girl, climb on up into the cab of my truck
Slide over to the middle seat
You look like you need a rough neck
A lot more than a man who's sweet
Come on girl let your hair down
Live wild and free
When I look into your eyes
I see a girl country as me

She was hot as fire under neon lights
DTF and lookin' for a good time
We hit the clubs all night
Shut 'em down and watched that sunrise

God bless blue jeans blue eyes
Fallin' in love on a miracle mile

Girl, climb on up into the cab of my truck
Slide over to the middle seat
You look like you need a rough neck
A lot more than a man who's sweet
Come on girl let your hair down
Live wild and free
When I look into your eyes
I see a girl country as me

She don't like wine, she likes Jim Beam and Bud Light
Sittin' on a tailgate round a bonfire
On a Oveyne county Saturday night

Climb on up into the cab of my truck
Slide over to the middle seat
You look like you need a rough neck
A lot more than you need a man who's sweet
Come on girl let your hair down
Live wild and free
When I look into your eyes I see
When I look into your eyes I see a girl country as me
Country as me

Haha
Girl, backwards hat, daisy dukes, fine as hell
Just my type

No, I don't have side steps
Jump on up into it
Have a good ole time
Now let's get out of here

[Verse 1]
Girl there's something about the shine and the pop of your lip gloss
And all that high busting out of your tiny little tank top
I'm picking up every little bit of the tease you've been laying down
(Got my head spinning round, damn near knocking me out, yeah)

[Verse 2]
See I was headed to get a drink at the bar round the back
But you pumped the brakes on my Nikes, stopped them dead in their tracks
Flipped my snap-back back, spun a whole 180
Had to work up the nerve jus to tell you, baby

[Chorus]
U turn, you turn the heat on
U turn every little bit of me on
A little drawl when you talk, little wiggle in your walk
The way you moving it, yeah you got me losing it
You've got, you've got me feeling four sheets
To the wind, the wind without no drinks
We got the band rocking right
Got the green light in your eyes
Want to hold you all night
Watching U turn, U turn
Yeah watching U turn, U turn
Yeah watching U turn

[Verse 3]
When I saw you break it down low you 'bout near gave me whiplash
Then you had to go and pull me in close by my dog tags
And now we're swaying, swaying side to side
(And I've got wandering hands getting lost in your wonderland)

[Verse 4]
Damn, what's that tattoo sneaking out of them hip-huggers?
I bet I'd see the other half if them boys will play some Usher
Yeah, yeah, you make me want to tell you all my confessions, girl
And not keep you guessing, girl

[Chorus]
U turn, you turn the heat on
U turn every little bit of me on
A little drawl when you talk, little wiggle in your walk
The way you moving it, yeah you got me losing it
You've got, you've got me feeling four sheets
To the wind, the wind without no drinks
We got the band rocking right
Got the green light in your eyes
Want to hold you all night
Watching you turn, you turn
Watching you turn, U turn
Yeah watching U turn

[Bridge]
Yeah, yeah, you make me want to tell you all my confessions, girl
And not keep you guessing, girl

[Chorus]
U turn, you turn the heat on
U turn every little bit of me on
A little drawl when you talk, little wiggle in your walk
The way you moving it, yeah you got me losing it
You've got, you've got me feeling four sheets
To the wind, the wind without no drinks
We got the band rocking right
Got the green light in your eyes
Want to hold you all night
Watching U turn, U turn
Yeah watching U turn, U turn
Yeah watching U turn
Watching you turn, U turn
Watching you turn, U turn
Yeah watching you turn

I like my coffee black
I sure to hate to shave
I drink a cold six pack
When I watch my Titans play
I still cut my own grass
Always try to get to church
Sometimes I'm fighting mad
But I love so much it hurts

Hard headed, stuck in my ways
I could try my whole life
But I know I won't change
I don't need a mirror lookin' back at me
Cause every day it's clearer and I see
I've got a lot of my old man in me

Still miss my home town
I like fishing in the summer rain
And I've thrown my voice out
At more than one little league game
And I'm good with a hammer and nail
Help my buddies when they get stuck
Yeah, I've done pretty good for myself
But I still drive that same old truck

Hard headed, stuck in my ways
I could try my whole life
But I know I won't change
I don't need a mirror lookin' back at me
Cause every day it's clearer and I see
I've got a lot of my old man...

And every step I take I know there will come a day
Where lookin' back I'll say I was proud to be..

Hard headed, stuck in my ways
I could try my whole life
But I know I won't change
I don't need a mirror lookin' back at me
Cause every day it's clearer and I see
A lot of my old man in me

I see a lot of you, Dad

Since the beginning of time, girls just ain't got their guys
They've been known to place the blame on that thing between our thighs
They searched our hearts, looked in our eyes, gonna sneak past our souls
But it ain't that hard girls, truth be told, its all how we hold our pole
You can tell a lot about a man, by the way he holds his pole
Does he hold it high, does he hold it low
Does he crank it fast or slow
Girls you wanna know your man, hey I understand
Just head down to a fishing hole
Cause you can tell a lot about a man by the way he holds his pole
Billy Joe yea he's been know to hold his all is life
And tractor Ty's the kind of guy to hide his from his wife
And I caught Brian peekin' at mine on day when we trolled
As I was reelin' he gotten the feelin' that he wanted to hold my pole

(Chorus)
Yea you know if its cold outside I ain't gonna be out there holdin' mine
My ole' rod may be past its prime but my baby says it works just fine

(Chorus x2)

[Intro]
Blue Tacoma, California
Rays of gold are shining on ya

[Verse 1]
Wheels rolling on an old Toyota
Twist top on a Sunkist soda
Your brown hair in the west coast wind
If heaven is anywhere
90’s hits at the top of our lungs
Shuffle landed on "Still the One"
Missing turns 'cause that's our song
If heaven is anywhere

[Chorus]
It's in a blue Tacoma, California
White magnolia in your hair
Rays of gold are shining on ya
Ooh, if heaven is anywhere
It's never running out of golden road
Always having your hand to hold
In a blue Tacoma, California
Ooh, if heaven is anywhere
It's right here
Blue Tacoma, California
Rays of gold are shining on ya

[Verse 2]
Red sun melting to the blacktop
Dollar shades from a nowhere truck stop
Your kiss and that coastline
If heaven is anywhere
Pull it over to the shoulder
To take it in
And pull you closer
Loving you longer than I ever did
Going places we never been
'Cause heaven's in

[Chorus]
A blue Tacoma, California
White magnolia in your hair
Rays of gold are shining on ya
Ooh, if heaven is anywhere
It's never running out of golden road
Always having your hand to hold
In a blue Tacoma, California
Ooh, if heaven is anywhere
It's right here

[Bridge]
Blue Tacoma, California
Rays of gold are shining on ya
If heaven is anywhere

[Chorus]
It's in a blue Tacoma, California
White magnolia in your hair
Rays of gold are shining on ya
Ooh, if heaven is anywhere
It's never running out of golden road
Always having your hand to hold
In a blue Tacoma, California
Ooh, if heaven is anywhere
It's right here
Blue Tacoma, California
Ooh, if heaven is anywhere
Rays of gold are shining on ya
(I'm always right here, always right here oh-oh, ooh)
Blue Tacoma, California (Oh)
Rays of gold are shining on ya
If heaven is anywhere

[Verse 1]
I was a boat stuck in a bottle
That never got the chance to touch the sea
Just forgot on the shelf
No wind in the sails
Going nowhere with no one but me
I was one in a hundred billion
A burned out star in a galaxy
Just lost in the sky wondering why
Everyone else shines out but me

[Chorus 1]
But I came to life when I first kissed you
The best me has his arms around you
You make me better than I was before
Thank God I'm yours

[Verse 2]
I was a worn out set of shoes
Wandering the city street
Another face in the crowd
Head looking down
Lost in the sound of a lonely melody
Empty pockets at a roulette
Always landing on a lost bet
Just live for the spin and hope for the win
Go all in just to lose again

[Chorus 2]
But I came to life when I first kissed you
The best me has his arms around you
You make me better than I was before
Thank God I'm yours
The worst me is just a long gone memory
You put a new heartbeat inside of me
You make me better than I was before
Thank God I'm yours

[Bridge]
I was a boat stuck in a bottle
That never got the chance to touch the sea

[Chorus 2]
I came to life when I first kissed you
The best me has his arms around you
You make me better than I was before
Thank God I'm yours
The worst me is just a long gone memory
You put a new heartbeat inside of me
You make me better than I was before
Thank God I'm yours

[Outro]
Thank God I'm yours
Thank God I'm yours, yours
Thank God I'm yours

[Intro]
Who!
Huh, yeah

[Verse 1]
My baby, she's Alabama
A dixie land delight, kissin' me like molasses
Slow and sweet, mhm, just right
She's an endless August summer, yeah, sunshine 3-6-5
When she forgets the punch line, it still gets me every time

[Chorus]
'Cause I love every little, every little, every little thing about her love
Just a little, just a little, just a little ain't enough
Gotta get a, gotta get a, get a little more of all she does
I'm all hung up, 'cause I love
Every little, every little, every little thing about her love

[Verse 2]
Yeah, she's Seattle and Sonoma
Runs on coffee and red wine
She's easy like Sunday morning and wild like Saturday night
She's 24-carat goodness, an angel's all I see
She dresses up for everything, but she only dress down for me

[Chorus]
And I love every little, every little, every little thing about her love
Just a little, just a little, just a little ain't enough
Gotta get a, gotta get a, get a little more of all she does
I'm all hung up, 'cause I love
Every little, every little, every little thing about her love

[Bridge]
Yeah! Who! Come on!
Woah, hey!
My baby, she's Alabama
My Dixie Land delight
She's everybody's dream girl, but she's all mine

[Chorus]
And I love every little, every little, every little thing about her love
Just a little, just a little, just a little ain't enough
Gotta get a, gotta get a, get a little more of all she does
I'm all hung up, 'cause I love
Every little, every little, every little thing about her love

[Outro]
About her love
Hey, hey, yeah
Who, hey, hey!
About her love

[Intro]
I'ma love you 'til the sun burns out

[Verse 1]
Hey would you love me
If my car broke down and I didn't have anymore money
If I told 'em all the time but my jokes weren't really that funny
Hey, would you love me
And would you keep me
If I couldn't make all your dreams come true like a genie
Girl come to find out, yeah loving me really ain't easy
Hey, would you keep me?

[Chorus]
'Cause I'ma love you 'til the sun burns out
Love you 'til my heart breaks down
Listen baby ain't no doubt that
I'ma love you, I'ma love you, I'ma love you
I'ma love you 'til we're old and grey
Love you 'til we're running out of days
Hear me baby when I say that
I'ma love you, I'ma love you, I'ma love you
Would you love me

[Verse 2]
If I didn't have a six pack and I was a really bad kisser
If I wasn't very good at taking all your pretty little pictures
Girl, would you love me
Because...

[Chorus]
'Cause I'ma love you 'til the sun burns out
Love you 'til my heart breaks down
Listen baby ain't no doubt that
I'ma love you, I'ma love you, I'ma love you

Love you 'til we're running out of days
Hear me baby when I say that

Would you love me?

[Bridge]
If I don't remember your face or remember your name
Tell me, oh tell me baby would you love me the same
'Cause...

[Chorus]
Yeah I'ma love you 'til the sun burns out
Love you 'til my heart breaks down
Listen baby ain't no doubt that
I'ma love you, I'ma love you, I'ma love you

Listen baby ain't no doubt that
Tell me baby, tell me baby
Would you love me
I'ma love you 'til the sun burns out
I'ma love you 'til my heart breaks down

[Verse 1]
Five across midnight, dress skin tight, room 203
You reach into my pocket, unlock it, hands all over me
Three little words, do not disturb, hanging from the handle
Feeling this fire, burning all night, like that candle

[Chorus]
So baby let it all fall down
Yeah just let it all fall down
That zipper on your black dress
Jimmy Choo necklace
Red bridal high heel shoes
Purse glittering gold
Baby, I don't want
Nothing on me but you
So let it all fall down

[Verse 2]
We spent all night downtown, now it's time to get down to you and me
Let your worries and your cares and your sugar brown hair just pour all over me

[Chorus]
So baby let it all fall down
Yeah just let it all fall down
That zipper on your black dress
Jimmy Choo necklace
Red bridal high heel shoes
Purse glittering gold
Baby, I don't want
Nothing on me but you
So let it all fall down

[Bridge]
Three little words, do not disturb, hanging from the handle
Let it all loose, from your hair to your shoes, tryna get a handle

[Chorus]
So baby let it all fall down
Yeah just let it all fall down
That zipper on your black dress
Jimmy Choo necklace
Red bridal high heel shoes
Purse glittering gold
Baby, I don't want
Nothing on me but you
So let it all fall down
Won't you let it all fall down

[Verse 1]
I was a boat stuck in a bottle
That never got the chance to touch the sea
Just forgot on the shelf
No wind in the sails
Going nowhere with no one but me
I was one in a hundred billion
A burned out star in a galaxy
Just lost in the sky wondering why
Everyone else shines out but me

[Chorus 1]
But I came to life when I first kissed you
The best me has his arms around you
You make me better than I was before
Thank God I'm yours

[Verse 2]
I was a worn out set of shoes
Wandering the city street
Another face in the crowd
Head looking down
Lost in the sound of a lonely melody
Empty pockets at a roulette
Always landing on a lost bet
Just live for the spin and hope for the win
Go all in just to lose again

[Chorus 2]
But I came to life when I first kissed you
The best me has his arms around you
You make me better than I was before
Thank God I'm yours
The worst me is just a long gone memory
You put a new heartbeat inside of me
You make me better than I was before
Thank God I'm yours, oh

[Bridge]
I was a boat stuck in a bottle
That never got the chance to touch the sea

[Chorus 2]
I came to life when I first kissed you
The best me has his arms around you
You make me better than I was before
Thank God I'm yours
The worst me is just a long gone memory
You put a new heartbeat inside of me
You make me better than I was before
Thank God I'm yours

[Outro]
Thank God I'm yours
Thank God I'm yours, oh
Thank God I'm yours

Gonna get down like it's your birthday

[Verse 1]
Twentysomething aluminum cans
Tied behind a 1920-something jet black Cadillac, yeah
Two twenty-something year old kids, right here
Real life begins with a camera flash and confetti kiss

[Chorus]
You, me, twentysomething
That old engine running
Ride off to the sunset
Rollin' bout twentysomething
Won't look back for nothing
All in, whatever love is, don't know
There's just something, something 'bout twentysomething

[Verse 2]
Twentysomething minutes out
We scraped up that twentysomething percent down
On twenty million things to fix
It's a lot of love and a couple tears
It'll be all ours in twentysomething years

[Bridge]
Feels like we're crazy
But ain't that the dream
Yeah we might be crazy
But baby there's something about you and me

[Verse 3]
You, me, twentysomething
We got a little one coming
Try to raise 'em up good and before we know it
They'll be twentysomething
Same wide eyes that we had
Fall in love and find out something
Something 'bout twentysomething

[Bridge]
Feels like we're crazy
But ain't that the dream (yes it is)
Yeah we might be crazy
But baby there's something about you and me

[Verse 4]
We love like crazy
That's all we need
Don't care what we're facing, girl, we'll make it
'Cause baby there's something about you and me
Girl there's just something about you and me
Twentysomething

[Intro]
Oh yeah, oh yeah

[Verse 1]
If lovin' was money, how much you think we'd make
If kisses were cash, we'd never stop making it rain, no
The way that I picture it our pockets thicker than Bill Gates
If lovin' was money, we'd make it all the way to the bank

[Chorus]
Rakin' it in by the billions
Cash stacked up to the ceiling
Livin' on champagne and chocolate, somewhere exotic
Kissin' on a beach, alone, 'cause we bought it
Talking gazillions, top o' Fortune 500 chillin', yeah
Girl if loving was dollars, you know we'd be ballers
Rakin' it in by the billions
Oh yeah

[Verse 2]
If lovin' was money, then we'd never clock out of work, nah
Girl, we'd stay extra hours, after all the lights have been turned off
Oh if all my attention was Benjamins, you'd have 'em all to burn
If lovin' was money, there's no telling what we'd be worth

[Chorus]
Rakin' it in by the billions
Cash stacked up to the ceiling
Livin' on champagne and chocolate, somewhere exotic
Kissin' on a beach, alone, cause we bought it
Talking gazillions, top o' Fortune 500 chillin', yeah
Girl if loving was dollars, you know we'd be ballers
Rakin' it in by the billions
Oh yeah

[Bridge]
Make a little love, make a little money
Make a little love, make a little money
Make a whole lotta love and a whole lotta money, oh

[Chorus]
Rakin' it in by the billions
Cash stacked up to the ceiling
Livin' on champagne and chocolate somewhere exotic
Kissin' on a beach, alone, cause we bought it
Talking gazillions, top o' Fortune 500 chillin', yeah
Girl if loving was dollars, you know we'd be ballers
Rakin' it in by the billions
Oh yeah
Just rakin' it in by the billions
Oh yeah, girl
If besos were pesos, no telling how much we'd make girl
You know we rakin' it in, rakin' it in, rakin' it in, yeah
Rakin' it in by the billions

[Verse 1]
Two hundred dollars on dinner and drinks
Ten dollar cover, the cool place to be downtown
We can go right now
We can wait in a line, drive just to park
Meet up with the crew and hop bar to bar all night
I'll let you decide
Girl we can get a plan right before rushing out the door or

[Chorus]
We can keep it lowkey
Girl it sure sounds good staying in and keeping you close to me
All dressed down and nowhere we're supposed to be
What you think about being homebodies
Just a box of wine and you and me
We can keep it lowkey

[Verse 2]
Girl we ain't gotta cook and we ain't gotta clean
Call that Chinese spot right down the street we like
And get a little takeout, a little makeout, that's right

[Chorus]
We can keep it lowkey
Girl it sure sounds good staying in and keeping you close to me
All dressed down and nowhere we're supposed to be
What you think about being homebodies
Just a box of wine and you and me
We can keep it lowkey

[Bridge]
Girl with you looking that way, we should stay
'Cause we're gonna wind up back here anyway

[Chorus]
Let's keep it lowkey
Girl it sure sounds good staying in and keeping you close to me
All dressed down and nowhere we're supposed to be
Girl what you think about being homebodies
Just a box of wine and you and me
Girl just you and me
We can keep it lowkey

[Outro]
We can keep it lowkey
Let's keep it lowkey
We can keep it lowkey, yeah

[Intro]
You look like a love song to me
And everything in my heart that I've heard
Oh baby now I see

[Verse 1]
I got a stack of vinyl a mile high that's talking about the love I want
But every time I turn it on, I can never sing along
'Till you came waltzing right into my life with lips just like a melody
Oh yeah, I've never set, never set my eyes on something so sweet

[Chorus]
'Cause you look like a love song to me
Everything in my heart that I've heard, oh baby now I see
Beautiful girl, you know you're making me sing
'Cause you look like a love song, you look like a love song to me

[Verse 2]
I finally relate to The Temptations talking about My Girl
Those lips and those curves, girl, I love how that harmony works
I follow that bassline right behind you
Taking my sweet time, feeling every note

[Chorus]
'Cause you look like a love song to me
Everything in my heart that I've heard, oh baby now I see
Beautiful girl, you know you're making me sing
'Cause you look like a love song, you look like a love song to me

[Outro]
You look like a love song to me, girl yes you do
And everything in my heart that I've heard, now I see
Beautiful girl, you know you're making me sing
'Cause you look like a love song, you look like a love song to me

[Verse 1]
Well it's Thursday and I'm thirsty for the weekend
Got a Yeti in the back packed down with drinks worth drinking
So take me to the redneck riviera
Short shorts, white thighs, I don't care
A couple long necks deep in a pink inflatable chair
Let's get there

[Chorus]
We gonna float
Like that ice cube melting right here in my Jack and Coke
Like a bobber on the water, gonna ride this thing real slow
All I want to do is float
It's all I'm trying to do today

[Verse 2]
There ain't no way any trouble's getting to me
When I'm drifting with the red stripe just like that buoy
Just take me to the redneck riviera
Fake Ray Bans and tank top tans
A couple long necks deep in a pink inflatable chair
Get me there

[Chorus]
We gonna float
Like that ice cube melting right here in my Jack and Coke
Like a Flori-Bama beach on the Gulf of Mexico
We just gonna coast
We gonna float
Like a bobber on the water, gonna ride this thing real slow
Just sippin' something fizzy, getting dizzy, rolling with the flow
All I want to do is float

[Bridge]
I'm talking F-L-O-A-T
Ocean, a kiddy pool, ain't gotta get too deep
I'm talking F-L-O-A-T
Fill something with air and fill your cup with a drink
You know it's F-L-O-A-T
Get your booty in the water, yeah you know you wanna

[Chorus]
We gonna float, yes we are, yes we are
Like that ice cube melting right here in my Jack and Coke
Like a Flori-Bama beach on the Gulf of Mexico
We just gonna coast
We gonna float
Like a bobber on the water, gonna ride this thing real slow
Just sippin' something fizzy, getting dizzy, rolling with the flow
All I want to do is
There ain't nothing to it just
All I want to do is float
Just float

[Verse 1]
I'm gonna make a change
For once in my life
It's gonna feel real good
Gonna make a difference
Gonna make it right, yeah
As I turned up the collar on my favorite winter coat
This wind just blows in my mind
I see the kids in the street, with not enough to eat
Who am I to be blind, pretending not to see their needs
A summer's disregard, a broken bottle top
And one man's soul
They follow each other on the wind, ya know
'Cause they got nowhere to go
That's why I want you to know

[Chorus]
That I'm starting with the man in the mirror
Oh, yeah
I'm asking him to change his ways
And no message could've been any clearer
And if you wanna make the world a better place
Take a look at yourself and then make a change
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse 2]
I've been a victim of a selfish kinda love
It's time that I realize
There are some with no homes
Without a nickel to loan
Could it be really me pretending that they're not alone
A willow deeply scarred, somebody's broken heart
And a washed out dream
They follow the pattern on the wind, ya see
Because they got no place to be
That's why I'm starting with me

[Extended Chorus]
And I'm starting with the man in the mirror
Oh, yeah
I'm asking him to change his ways
And no message could've been any clearer
And If you wanna make the world a better place
Take a look at yourself and then make that change
Cause I'm starting with that man in the mirror
I'm asking him to change his ways, yeah
No message could've been any clearer
And if you wanna make the world a better place
Take a look at yourself and then make that change
I'm starting with the man in the mirror, oh
I'm asking him to change his ways, yeah
No message could've been any clearer

[Bridge]
And If you wanna make the world a better place
Take a look at yourself and then make the change
You gotta get it right, while you got the time
And then, you will close your, your mind

[Chorus]
(That man, that man In the mirror)
I'm asking him to change his ways, yeah
No message could've been any clearer
And if you want to make the world a better place
Take a look at yourself, you gotta make that change
Oh, with that man in the mirror, yeah
Ooh, ooh

[Outro]
Make that change!
Make that change!
Make that change! Yeah
It's gonna be a, it's gonna be a
It's gonna feel real good
Oh
You know it, change
With that man, that man, that man
It's gonna feel real good, you know it
Change, oh yeah
Gonna make that change
