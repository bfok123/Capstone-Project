[Intro: Post Malone]
Hahahahaha
Tank God
Ayy, ayy

[Chorus: Post Malone]
I've been fuckin' hoes and poppin' pillies
Man, I feel just like a rockstar (Star, ayy, ayy)
All my brothers got that gas
And they always be smokin' like a Rasta ('Sta)
Fuckin' with me, call up on a Uzi
And show up, man, them the shottas ('Tas)
When my homies pull up on your block
They make that thing go grrra-ta-ta-ta (Ta, pow, pow, pow, ayy, ayy)

[Verse 1: Post Malone]
Switch my whip, came back in black
I'm startin' sayin', "Rest in peace to Bon Scott" (Scott, ayy)
Close that door, we blowin' smoke
She ask me light a fire like I'm Morrison ('Son, ayy)
Act a fool on stage
Prolly leave my fuckin' show in a cop car (Car, ayy)
Shit was legendary
Threw a TV out the window of the Montage
Cocaine on the table, liquor pourin', don't give a damn
Dude, your girlfriend is a groupie, she just tryna get in
Sayin', "I'm with the band" (Ayy, ayy)
Now she actin' outta pocket, tryna grab up on my pants
Hundred bitches in my trailer say they ain't got a man
And they all brought a friend (Yeah, ayy, ayy, ayy)

[Chorus: Post Malone]
I've been fuckin' hoes and poppin' pillies
Man, I feel just like a rockstar (Star, ayy, ayy)
All my brothers got that gas
And they always be smokin' like a Rasta ('Sta)
Fuckin' with me, call up on a Uzi
And show up, man, them the shottas ('Tas)
When my homies pull up on your block
They make that thing go grrra-ta-ta-ta (Ta, pow, pow, pow)

[Verse 2: 21 Savage]
I've been in the Hills fuckin' superstars
Feelin' like a popstar (21, 21, 21)
Drankin' Henny, bad bitches jumpin' in the pool
And they ain't got on no bra (Bra)
Hit her from the back, pullin' on her tracks
And now she screamin' out, "¡No más!" (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
They like, "Savage, why you got a 12 car garage
And you only got six cars?" (21)
I ain't with the cakin', how you kiss that? (Kiss that?)
Your wifey say I'm lookin' like a whole snack (Big snack)
Green hundreds in my safe, I got old racks (Old racks)
L.A. bitches always askin', "Where the coke at?" (21, 21)
Livin' like a rockstar, smash out on a cop car
Sweeter than a Pop-Tart, you know you are not hard
I done made the hot chart, 'member I used to trap hard
Livin' like a rockstar, I'm livin' like a rockstar (Ayy)

[Chorus: Post Malone & 21 Savage]
I've been fuckin' hoes and poppin' pillies
Man, I feel just like a rockstar (Star, ayy, ayy)
All my brothers got that gas
And they always be smokin' like a Rasta ('Sta, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Fuckin' with me, call up on a Uzi
And show up, man, them the shottas ('Tas)
When my homies pull up on your block
They make that thing go grrra-ta-ta-ta (Ta, grrra-ta-ta-ta-ta)

Spendin', I'm spendin' all my fuckin' pay

[Verse 1]
I got me some braids and I got me some hoes
Started rockin' the sleeve, I can't ball with no Joes
You know how I do it, Concords on my toes

I ain't rich yet, but you know I ain't broke, I (I ain't broke, I)
So if I see it, I like it, buy that from the store, I (That from the store, I)

[Verse 2]
Ooh, Stoney
Cigarettes and a headband
Commas, commas in my head, man
Slumped over like a dead man
Red and black, 'bout my bread, man
I'm the answer, never question
Lace up, learn a lesson
Bitch, I'm saucin' (Wow), I do this often, don't do no talkin' (No)
My options right when I walk in, jump all them Jordans (Ooh)
I'm ballin', money jumpin'
Like I'm Davis from New Orleans
Or bitch I'm Harden, I don't miss nothin'
Fuck practice, this shit just happens, know y'all can't stand it (Ayy)
I have it, I never pass it, I work my magic
High average, ball on these bastards, it makes me happy
It's tragic, I make it happen, and all y'all Shaqtin'

[Pre-Chorus]
White Iverson
When I started ballin' I was young
You gon' think about me when I'm gone

[Outro]
Ooh-ooh

Ooh-ooh[Verse 1]
Thought I'd end up with Sean
But he wasn't a match
Wrote some songs about Ricky
Now I listen and laugh
Even almost got married
And for Pete, I'm so thankful
Wish I could say, "Thank you" to Malcolm
'Cause he was an angel

[Pre-Chorus]
One taught me love
One taught me patience
And one taught me pain
Now, I'm so amazing
Say I've loved and I've lost
But that's not what I see
So, look what I got
Look what you taught me
And for that, I say

[Chorus]
Thank you, next (Next)
Thank you, next (Next)
Thank you, next
I'm so fuckin' grateful for my ex
Thank you, next (Next)
Thank you, next (Next)
Thank you, next (Next)
I'm so fuckin'—

[Verse 2]
Spend more time with my friends
I ain't worried 'bout nothin'
Plus, I met someone else
We havin' better discussions
I know they say I move on too fast
But this one gon' last
'Cause her name is Ari
And I'm so good with that (So good with that)

[Pre-Chorus]
She taught me love (Love)
She taught me patience (Patience)
How she handles pain (Pain)
That shit's amazing (Yeah, she's amazing)
I've loved and I've lost (Yeah, yeah)
But that's not what I see (Yeah, yeah)
'Cause look what I've found (Yeah, yeah)
Ain't no need for searching, and for that, I say

[Chorus]
Thank you, next (Thank you, next)
Thank you, next (Thank you, next)
Thank you, next (Thank you)

[Post-Chorus]
Thank you, next

[Bridge]
One day I'll walk down the aisle
Holding hands with my mama
I'll be thanking my dad
'Cause she grew from the drama
Only wanna do it once, real bad
Gon' make that shit last
God forbid something happens
Least this song is a smash (Song is a smash)

[Pre-Chorus]
I've got so much love (Love)
Got so much patience (Patience)
And I've learned from the pain (Pain)
I turned out amazing (Turned out amazing)
Say I've loved and I've lost (Yeah, yeah)
But that's not what I see (Yeah, yeah)
'Cause look what I've found (Yeah, yeah)
Ain't no need for searching

Yeah, breakfast at Tiffany's and bottles of bubbles
Girls with tattoos who like getting in trouble
Lashes and diamonds, ATM machines
Buy myself all of my favorite things (Yeah)
Been through some bad shit, I should be a sad bitch
Who woulda thought it'd turn me to a savage?
Rather be tied up with calls and not strings
Write my own checks like I write what I sing, yeah (Yeah)

[Pre-Chorus]
My wrist, stop watchin', my neck is flossy
Make big deposits, my gloss is poppin'
You like my hair? Gee, thanks, just bought it
I see it, I like it, I want it, I got it (Yeah)

[Chorus]
I want it, I got it, I want it, I got it
I want it, I got it, I want it, I got it
You like my hair? Gee, thanks, just bought it
I see it, I like it, I want it, I got it (Yep)

[Verse 2]
Wearing a ring, but ain't gon' be no "Mrs."
Bought matching diamonds for six of my bitches
I'd rather spoil all my friends with my riches
Think retail therapy my new addiction
Whoever said money can't solve your problems
Must not have had enough money to solve 'em
They say, "Which one?" I say, "Nah, I want all of 'em"
Happiness is the same price as red-bottoms

[Pre-Chorus]
My smile is beamin' (Yeah), my skin is gleamin' (Is gleamin')
The way it shine, I know you've seen it (You've seen it)
I bought a crib just for (Just for) the closet (Closet)
Both his and hers, I want it, I got it, yeah

[Chorus]
I want it, I got it, I want it, I got it
I want it, I got it, I want it, I got it (Baby)
You like my hair? Gee, thanks, just bought it (Oh yeah)
I see it, I like it, I want it, I got it (Yep)

[Verse 3]
Yeah, my receipts be lookin' like phone numbers
If it ain't money, then wrong number
Black card is my business card
The way it be settin' the tone for me
I don't mean to brag, but I be like, "Put it in the bag," yeah
When you see them racks, they stacked up like my ass, yeah
Shoot, go from the store to the booth
Make it all back in one loop, gimme the loot
Never mind, I got the juice
Nothing but net when we shoot
Look at my neck, look at my jet
Ain't got enough money to pay me respect
Ain't no budget when I'm on the set
If I like it, then that's what I get, yeah

[Chorus]
I want it, I got it, I want it, I got it (Oh yeah)
I want it, I got it, I want it, I got it (Oh yeah, yeah)
You like my hair? Gee, thanks, just bought it
I see it, I like it, I want it, I got it (I see, yep)
